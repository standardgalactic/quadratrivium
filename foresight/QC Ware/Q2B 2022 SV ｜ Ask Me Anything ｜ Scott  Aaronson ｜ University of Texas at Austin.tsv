0	8400	Hi everyone, great to see you all at Q2B, and very excited to be closing this out.
8400	14440	My name is Anastasia Marcinkova, I'm a research engineer, scientist at Bleximo, and I've spent
14440	19920	the last decade in various parts of quantum computing and information from neutral atoms,
19920	22360	trapped ions, and now in superconducting qubits.
22360	28240	And I'm very excited, you know, 10 years ago I was taking the physics GRE, and very sad
28240	31960	about my scores, wondering if I get into grad school, and this year I get to be up on stage
31960	35400	with Scott Aaronson.
35400	38840	I've never taken a physics GRE, I'm not sure I could pass one.
38840	43480	Oh wow, okay, well, go, so tell us a little bit about yourself and your latest work.
43480	52720	Well, I took the computer science GRE, I came into quantum computing entirely from the math
53160	59000	and CS direction, and got very excited that it was just vectors and matrices, you know,
59000	62560	that was all I needed to know to start working on quantum algorithms.
62560	67720	Now, eventually, after I'd been in this field for long enough and hung out with enough physicists,
67720	72520	at some point I picked up what a Hamiltonian was, and then I learned what a Boson and a
72520	77640	Fermion was, now I'm trying to learn what ADS-CFT is, and then, you know, a little bit
77640	80040	about what a black hole is.
80160	85360	Okay, but, you know, I just sort of pick up my physics on the streets.
85360	93560	Now, in terms of my recent work, I happened to be on leave this year from my normal job
93560	100640	at, you know, teaching computer science at UT Austin, I am working for OpenAI, which
100640	108000	is based in San Francisco, on the theoretical foundations of AI safety, okay, such as if
108080	113520	any of you have tried out a GPT, you know, how can we prevent it from being misused?
113520	120760	How can we prevent every student in the world from using it to write their term paper, okay?
120760	126960	So, you know, that has very little to do with quantum computing, and I, you know, quantum
126960	133320	computing was my first love, and I intend to come back to it, but yeah, that's some
133360	139360	of what I've been thinking about, you know, and I also continue to work with my students
139360	146960	in postdocs, we have some neat projects, one of them about reconstructing the bulk in quantum
146960	154400	gravity, continue to think about quantum supremacy experiments, how can we make them easier to
154400	161200	verify the results using a classical computer, you know, how can we use them for, you know,
161240	167640	certified random bits, or for other purposes, so yeah, those are the quantum things that
167640	169680	I continue to think about.
169680	174000	Great, so we're definitely going to get a little bit into the wormholes and the work
174000	178080	at OpenAI, but first I want to talk a little bit about the quantum space, and what do you
178080	181800	think are the most exciting developments this year in the quantum space?
181800	187120	Yeah, well, I mean, a major milestone in the past year was the proof of the so-called
187160	194960	NLTS conjecture, which showed how entanglement can survive even at finite temperature, you
194960	200960	know, like very large amounts of entanglement, it's, you know, a major step toward potentially
200960	207640	proving this quantum PCP theorem, which has, you know, been a central problem in the field
207640	210320	since 2005 or so.
211320	219120	Now, I was also super excited this past spring by a breakthrough of Yamakawa and Janshree,
219120	225360	and so they've given sort of an entirely new type of exponential quantum speedup, not
225360	235360	yet for a directly useful problem, but it is an exponential quantum speedup for a search
235360	241360	problem, so a problem with verifiable solutions, and which works relative to a random oracle.
241360	248160	Okay, so a random oracle, you know, is a sort of idealized object, but you can substitute
248160	251480	it in real life using a pseudo-random function.
251480	256360	Okay, so their proposal leads to an experiment that, you know, I mean, if you had, you would
256360	261520	need a fault-tolerant quantum computer, the same kind that you would need for Shor's algorithm,
261520	267040	for example, but, you know, if so, you know, this is sort of an entirely new class of exponential
267040	274000	quantum speedups, different from, you know, the kind in Shor's algorithm, for example,
274000	280040	and I think, you know, it's opened up a whole new avenue of possibilities to play with.
280040	288480	Now, there's been progress in the past year in understanding quantum algorithms for homology
288480	295520	problems, for, you know, topological data analysis, both positive and negative.
295520	304000	There have been some de-quantizations of these topological data analysis algorithms.
304000	314120	There's also, like, approximately a QMA hardness for Klee homology, due to, in part to Marcos,
314120	323440	who now works at QCWare, so, you know, so we're getting a better understanding of that.
323440	327880	There has been progress on quantum supremacy experiments.
327880	337640	Xanadu did a Gaussian boson sampling experiment in the past year with a photon number resolving
337640	343240	detectors and, you know, tunable beam splitters and hundreds of photons.
343240	348480	So that was cool, and I think, you know, established a state of the art there.
348480	353320	But there's also been progress in a negative direction, as many of you have seen.
353320	360280	Classical computer scientists have gotten better at figuring out how to take the random
360280	366200	circuit sampling experiments, for example, and spoof them classically.
366200	374960	So I would especially mention work by Zhun Gao and Belaz Barak and others at Harvard,
374960	382220	and also some very new work by Darita Harinov and Umesh Vazharani and others that have given
382220	390000	algorithms, you know, that, you know, I would say leave the quantum advantage that was achieved
390000	391920	by Google a few years ago.
391920	396240	You know, they leave it still standing because, you know, either they're less efficient or
396240	401640	else they get a benchmark and this linear cross entropy score that is not as good as
401640	408120	what the Google experiment demonstrated, okay, but they leave the claim of quantum supremacy
408120	413560	standing more precariously than I would like, okay, and I would say that the ball is now
413560	421040	firmly in the court of the experimentalists to do better quantum supremacy experiments
421040	425520	with better gate fidelities, for example, that will put more distance because, you know,
425520	431840	we would like quantum supremacy not only to have been achieved, but to stay achieved,
431840	438920	okay, so that's been another thing, yes, so those are some of the developments in the
438920	439920	last year.
439920	447720	I mean, there was major progress in understanding, I think, the relation of quantum computing
447720	454440	theory to the black hole information problem worked by Daniel Harlow and Netta Engelhardt
454440	459080	and so forth involving non-isometric codes, you know, and that's lead to all sorts of
459080	464560	open questions that are interesting to people like me, you know, even if we don't know,
464560	471280	you know, even if we didn't care about black holes or string theory or anything like that,
471280	477160	but you know, in terms of the more practical developments, yeah, I think, you know, those
477520	479880	are some of the developments that most excited me.
479880	484320	Yeah, definitely, so I loved reading your last blog post, I know we've all been busy
484320	488920	with the conference, but I highly recommend reading it, it was a great, great analysis
488920	494760	of this, but let's dive in more to the quantum supremacy, so in 2019, Google had the Quantum
494760	499160	Advantage experiment, a few other groups, you mentioned Zandu carried out their own
499160	504080	experiments, but these experiments are really not free of that criticism, and on that blog,
504080	508120	you talked about the random circuit sampling, and even though the authors themselves did
508120	513200	not claim breaking Quantum Advantage, some other people say that it might have refuted
513200	517640	that, so how do we actually clearly establish quantum supremacy, and what do you think is
517640	520440	what we need to do to get to that phase?
520440	529440	Yeah, well, I think that, you know, often it's just a matter of reading what the paper
529480	536480	actually says, rather than just trying to get some kind of vague zeitgeist or vague feeling
536760	543760	about it, so the thing is, from the very beginning of this quest to demonstrate quantum advantage
545520	552520	supremacy, whatever, in the NISC era, we knew that we were playing a game where, fundamentally,
553520	560520	it doesn't scale, right, like we might be able to do this with 50 qubits or 100 qubits,
561120	567520	but you're not going to scale to 1,000 qubits, because if you did, then presumably you would
567520	574360	want an enormous circuit depth to get all your qubits to talk to each other, but the
574360	578920	signal that you can read out when you make a measurement, if your qubits are not error
578920	584720	corrected, then your signal is going to degrade exponentially as a function of the depth,
584720	589720	right, so when the depth becomes too large, you just can't read the signal anymore, your
589720	596720	signal to noise ratio is negligible, so we knew that ultimately what you need is quantum
599480	603880	error correction, right, and hopefully, you know, that message has come through loud and
603920	610280	clear through many of the talks that you've been to over the past three days, right, ultimately
610280	615840	scaling will require error correction, okay, so we've been playing a game where we hope
615840	622600	to eke out, you know, some advantage before that era, that, you know, that at least puts
622600	627360	the ball in the skeptics court, right, at least makes it, you know, gives them the challenge
627360	631480	of saying, okay, if you don't believe that quantum computing can ever work, right, well,
631600	637440	it seems like, you know, how do you explain the results of this experiment, right, without
637440	642720	talking about a two to the 50th dimensional Hilbert space, you know, that was actually
642720	647360	involved in the computation, right, you know, just today I was arguing with people on my
647360	653400	blog who were, you know, you know, and making this point, right, I think these experiments
653400	659960	have put the ball in their court, and that was the original point, right, so now what
660000	666400	the new work by Harinov-Vazharani at all, what that has done is to sort of nail down
666400	673320	the conclusion a little bit more rigorously, that indeed, you know, it's not going to scale,
673320	679040	you know, the quantum advantage will not scale to more and more qubits without error correction.
679040	683960	There was a little loophole in that statement that we, you know, did not know how to rigorously
683960	689560	justify, namely, like, what about when the circuit depth is neither too large nor too
689560	697560	small, like, you know, if the circuit depth is constant, then we, you know, and the gates
697560	703400	are geometrically local, then we know how to simulate the thing using tensor network methods,
703400	708040	if the circuit depth is too high, then, you know, the noise is too great, okay, but if
708040	712680	the circuit depth was like logarithmic in the number of qubits, then we didn't know
712760	719640	how to rule out that random circuit sampling could give you a quantum advantage even that
719640	725240	would scale to arbitrary numbers of qubits with no error correction, and so, you know,
725240	730040	using sophisticated techniques, they've now ruled that out, okay, but it's important to
730040	735960	understand that, you know, this proves a conjecture that, you know, everyone in the working in the
735960	741720	field, I think, would have made. It doesn't disprove a conjecture, okay, so, yeah.
742280	749560	Okay, great. So how do we get there, I guess? So what fields do you think in the quantum space
749560	755880	have been over-served versus under-served? You and I probably remember very well the QAOA craze
755880	763640	a few years ago where every paper, you know, every day was QAOA. Is that over? You're speaking
763720	768040	about it in the past 10. I know, well, maybe, but I'm seeing less of it these days.
768040	776520	All right. Some of the years were a lot, but yeah, have we gone to deep in QAOA? Or not deep enough
776520	781080	in other parts that will get us to that quantum supremacy that we need? Yeah, well, I mean,
781800	788520	the kind of thing that I always want to see less of is, you know, the papers where they say, you
789080	793960	know, we do such and such with a quantum computer, right? We show how you can do
795160	801400	machine learning, optimization, finance, this or that, and they don't even ask the question of,
801400	806040	well, how does it compare against, you know, what you could have done with a classical computer,
806040	812200	right? And where sort of the entire case seems to depend on just no one, you know, everyone
812200	817560	tacitly agreeing to not ask that question, right? You know, as obvious as that sounds,
817560	824040	you know, I feel like that still describes like at least 15 to 20 percent of all of the papers
824040	829240	that I see on the Quant PH archive, okay? And I'm always hoping to see less of that.
831320	834600	Now, you know, in terms of what I'd like to see more of, right? I mean,
836040	842520	yeah, I mean, I always get interested when I see a paper that just sort of steps back and, you know,
842520	847160	looks for a new kind of quantum speedup, you know, just like that this example by
847960	853320	the work by Yamakawa and Jantree that I mentioned earlier, right? Even if it's not immediately
853320	859560	useful for anything that I can see, right? You know, I'm way more excited about a new kind,
859560	867000	you know, a sort of fundamental new source of quantum speedup, you know, that then we can
867000	872280	think about what it is good for. Then I am about, you know, someone who starts with, you know,
872280	878920	what they want, like some, you know, finance application or some vehicle routing application,
878920	886040	and then, you know, tries to, you know, say, well, here's the quantum algorithm to do it. And,
886040	893560	you know, and as long as no one asks too hard about, you know, how, as long as no one pushes too
893560	898760	hard on how well could we have done the same thing classically, you know, we can impress people by
898760	904360	saying that we did this with a quantum computer. So we've talked a lot about the algorithm side,
904360	908760	but what about the hardware side? Have you seen any great accomplishments this year? And what are
908760	913160	you kind of looking for that canary in the coal mine of when you're going to start getting really
913160	918680	excited about this being actually applied to hardware? Well, look, I mean, I mean, I've been
918680	923960	excited enough for 20 plus years to, you know, spend my career working in this field, right?
925640	937080	So, but, you know, with, you know, quantum, the sort of first quantum supremacy experiments now,
937080	943560	you know, three years old, I think, you know, it's clear to most people in the field what the next
943560	951160	steps are, you know, you know, demonstrate quantum error correction, just keep a, a logical qubit
951160	957880	alive for a long time, you know, demonstrate that you can do that, you know, against both X errors
957880	964040	and Z errors, you know, that you can do fault tolerant operations, you know, of course, many
964040	969560	groups are working or racing toward trying to demonstrate that. But I would also stress,
970040	976680	you know, do better quantum supremacy experiments, you know, I do not regard that as a done deal,
976680	982600	right? Because, you know, again, classical spoofers have gotten better and better, right? Now, on the,
982600	988200	you know, what I would really like, you know, this is, unfortunately, you know, when the hardware
988200	993800	people come, you know, this is something that we have not yet managed to solve for them. But to
993800	1000120	figure out how to do near term quantum supremacy experiments where the answer can also be
1000120	1006040	efficiently verified using a classical computer, right, where you don't have to calculate this
1006040	1012040	linear cross entropy score, which takes an exponential amount of time on a classical computer
1012040	1017720	in order to verify the results. I, you know, I think, you know, the, the current generation
1017720	1023160	of quantum supremacy experiments are inherently limited to, you know, 60 qubits, let's say,
1023160	1027720	because beyond that, we don't even know how to verify the answer. So, you know, I'm, you know,
1027720	1034120	I have some ideas for how we're going to go beyond that. But I think that will really take a new idea.
1035960	1040040	Great. So one last question for me before we get back to the audience and,
1040040	1043880	you know, obviously for everyone else, you know, send your quantum supremacy experiments to Scott
1043880	1049400	to check up on before, so you don't get a blog post about your paper, or maybe you want that.
1050360	1055720	So you've done amazing work at OpenAI so far, and, you know, a big question is,
1055720	1060120	are you coming back to quantum? When are you coming back? And are you going to take any
1060120	1068440	learnings back? Yeah, I mean, I guess I never really left. Don't tell my bosses at OpenAI that,
1068440	1076280	but I, you know, I mean, I still, you know, I'm based in Austin mostly. I still run my research
1076280	1083160	group. I supervise my, you know, students and postdocs. We continue to write quantum computing
1083160	1088680	papers. But, you know, I'm not, I'm not teaching this year. And so I am, you know, spending the
1088680	1094280	majority of my time thinking about AI safety. You know, I mean, I mean, quantum computing,
1094280	1099480	in some sense, was my first love. You know, when I was a beginning grad student in 2000,
1099480	1104280	I was actually deciding then whether to go into quantum computing or machine learning.
1104920	1111000	Those were, those were my two main choices. And, you know, I already had a sense then that
1111000	1116520	machine learning was going to be societally important on a shorter time scale. You know,
1116520	1121240	this was a decade before the deep learning revolution started, right? So I didn't even
1121240	1126360	know how important, but, you know, it seemed like, and yet quantum computing was just more fun,
1126360	1132040	okay? Because, you know, with machine learning, kind of everything was messy and empirical,
1132040	1137640	right? And, you know, you could just sort of stare at graphs and try to, you know, infer what
1137640	1142760	was going on. But there was never any theory to explain it. And with quantum computing, even
1142760	1148840	though we were so far from having the actual devices, you know, we could understand so much
1148840	1154040	about the various quantum algorithms and why they worked or didn't work. And so,
1154040	1161560	you know, 20-some years later, I still feel like quantum computing is more fun. And so, you know,
1161560	1168600	I don't know. But, you know, I just, I tend to get drawn to problems that are fun,
1168600	1173240	as opposed to having any kind of coherent plan for, you know, what I'm going to work on.
1174840	1180280	All right. Well, thank you so much for answering my questions. And now we'd like to open it up to
1180280	1183640	the audience. So ask all your questions for Scott.
1184520	1197640	Hello, Scott. Hi. It's an honor. I wanted to ask you what are your thoughts on, I mean,
1197640	1201400	it's an open question, but what are your thoughts on the classes of problems that are
1201400	1205400	quantumly easy and classically hard to solve? So, to be a bit more specific,
1206520	1213160	using near-term devices, what area do you think quantum computing can have the most impact on?
1213400	1220600	Yeah. So our best bet for near-term devices, you know, remains what it was when
1220600	1225160	Feynman started talking about quantum computing 40 years ago, right? Namely,
1225160	1232040	simulating quantum physics, right? Learning more about materials, about chemistry, as we heard
1232040	1239080	in the very nice talk by Brigitte Whaley this morning. You know, learning about reaction rates,
1239400	1245720	you know, hopefully, you know, learning about condensed matter physics, maybe even learning
1245720	1250600	about quantum gravity. You know, for anyone who's wondering, I do not think we learned anything
1250600	1255880	new from this nine-qubit simulation of a wormhole, quote-unquote. We did open one?
1255880	1261880	We didn't open a wormhole. Yeah. Well, if we did open a wormhole, then it's in a different universe,
1261880	1267800	you know, not one that we have any access to, right? But, you know, so other people might
1267800	1272760	equivalently describe the situation by just saying we ran a little quantum circuit on nine
1272760	1278920	qubits, right? And we knew perfectly well what the outcome was going to be. So, I mean, this is,
1278920	1284360	you know, like, when this is the thing, like, when you do, you know, when you sort of design a
1284360	1290040	quantum circuit or a quantum protocol, but then you feel like, well, maybe people won't, you know,
1290040	1295400	pay enough attention or it won't get into nature, you know, unless I actually run it on a quantum
1295400	1301160	computer, even though I know full well what the result is going to be, like, this has less of the
1301160	1311640	character of an experiment, more the character of a PR stunt, right? And so, but having said that,
1311640	1317960	you know, once you can scale up to devices with, you know, 100 qubits, 200 qubits, you know,
1317960	1323720	we will be able to test out models of condensed matter physics, even, you know, theoretical
1323720	1328200	models of quantum gravity in a way that might tell us something that we didn't already know,
1328200	1334840	and that is genuinely an interesting prospect. And ironically, one of the earliest things that
1334840	1341720	we might be able to do with quantum computers, just because, you know, with chemistry, for example,
1341720	1346360	there's all sorts of messy details that you have to get right because you have to match observed
1346360	1350440	reality, right? With quantum gravity, you can just make up the model.
1353160	1357800	I always joke that a first quantum computer may build a better quantum computer.
1357800	1363560	Yes. Well, yeah, okay, so you could say that that's the other main, main application of near
1363560	1368840	term quantum computers, namely, learn about the problem of building a quantum computer, right?
1368840	1373720	It's kind of like the main application of sending humans to space, right, which is to learn about
1373720	1382680	how to send humans into space. Hi, Scott. Over here? Yeah. No, over to your left. Hi. Hi. Mark
1382680	1388440	Masingly Scott, it's my name. I have a question about, you mentioned that quantum computing is
1389080	1395000	interesting because it's fun. My question is about the commercialization of quantum computing.
1395960	1400120	Do you think about that? What do you think about that? And I won't ask you the question,
1400680	1404920	when do you think it's going to be commercially viable? Because the answer is always in five years.
1404920	1409160	But what do you think is going to happen between now and it actually becoming commercially viable?
1410920	1416280	So I certainly think about it. I mean, often I'm thinking about it in the context of someone has
1416280	1423560	claimed to have something that is already commercially useful. And it's based on statements
1423560	1429880	that are insofar as we can evaluate them seem to be false. And then I get emails
1429880	1441160	about it. And then I have to write a blog post about it. But I think that I am cautiously optimistic
1441160	1448920	that within the next decade, we will see the first quantum computations that are actually useful
1448920	1454200	for learning about various quantum systems. I think maybe first we will see things that are
1454200	1459960	scientifically interesting, or that teach us something new about materials. And then maybe
1459960	1465880	we will start to see things that are also commercially interesting. What tends to irk me
1465880	1475160	is when people are seeming to jump the cue here, where we haven't even clearly established the
1475160	1481320	reality of any quantum speed up at all, even for something completely useless, let alone for
1481400	1486520	something scientifically interesting, let alone for something commercially useful. And then they're
1486520	1498600	already talking about working with Volkswagen to optimize vehicle routing. If you were actually
1498600	1503720	going to beat classical here, then you would have been able to do all of these earlier steps in the
1503720	1511800	process, which are still huge, unsolved challenges. So that tends to be my feeling about it. Now,
1512760	1519320	when I look at the various quantum startups today, some of them I'm actually very enthusiastic about.
1519320	1527640	And I hope that they, I'm not like investing my own money in them. But then again, I'm not a
1527640	1535720	venture capitalist. My money is just sits in the bank doing nothing. Certainly there are startups
1535720	1544040	where I feel like they're taking a big risk, but I hope that they succeed. But usually when I'm
1544040	1550200	asked to judge some startup, like I'm judging something different than maybe most people would,
1550200	1556920	which is I'm looking at, I can't judge all kinds of things about the quantum computing startups
1556920	1563880	about their hardware, about their plans for the future. I can just judge the statements that they
1563880	1570440	make now about quantum algorithms and see if they're true or not. Or if they let they comport
1570440	1578520	with no knowledge. And if they're saying things that I know are false or wildly exaggerated,
1578520	1583880	then that gives me less confidence, of course, about the parts that I can't judge. And conversely,
1583880	1587320	if they're careful about the things I can judge, then I have more confidence.
1593400	1601160	Hi. Oh, sorry. You had mentioned, can you hear me? It's working. I can hear. Okay. You had mentioned
1603640	1608760	in the 20 years ago, when you were deciding to go one way or another. And during that time,
1608760	1616680	you wrote a very interesting paper on who can name the biggest number. And therein,
1616680	1624360	you discussed the busy beaver problem and how huge it gets. But you never mentioned in there
1624360	1631000	how it gets so big. I mean, you mentioned in there Rado who invented it in the game 1960.
1631560	1638040	And if I remember right, he said beaver busy number four or five is something humanity can never
1638040	1645080	know. Well, busy beaver five, we might know. In fact, there's a conjecture that it's about 47
1645080	1653080	million. Busy beaver of six is at least 10 to the 10 to the 10 to the 10 to the 10 and so on 15
1653080	1659080	times. And there is my question in that paper. Yes. You mentioned that intriguing effect, but you
1659080	1662600	never explained how it gets so big. How's that possible? Okay. All right. All right. Fine. Well,
1663080	1668040	this question has nothing to do with quantum computing. Let's be clear. Ask me anything,
1668040	1673320	though, right? Yeah. Fine. Fine. Fine. I didn't say I didn't say I didn't say I wasn't going to
1673320	1683400	answer it. So by the way, I would not have mentioned in 1999 that busy beaver of six is that enormous
1683400	1687320	because that wasn't known at the time. Okay. That was only discovered actually within the
1687320	1696280	past year, which is kind of a cool discovery. So the busy beaver of n is defined as the largest
1696280	1702040	finite number of steps that can be taken by a Turing machine with n steps. So basically think
1702040	1709400	of like the largest number of things that an n-bit computer program can do if it has to halt
1709400	1716440	afterward. And what you can prove is that this function as a function of n grows faster than
1716440	1723800	any computable function. We know that because if it were computable, then you could use that to
1723800	1730120	solve the halting problem, which Alan Turing proved was impossible. So in some sense, that gives you
1730120	1736360	the abstract reason why it has to grow ridiculously fast because otherwise you could use it to solve
1736360	1741080	the halting problem. Okay. But if you want to be a little more concrete, you could say, look, you
1741080	1749000	can encode and actually someone did this not long ago. You can build a 27 state Turing machine
1749000	1754840	that halts if and only if there is a counter example to the Goldbuck conjecture. It says every
1754840	1761560	even number four greater is the sum of two primes. And so in order to know even just busy beaver of
1761560	1769880	27, you would have to settle Goldbuck's conjecture. Okay. So this one function encodes in it a large
1769960	1775160	fraction of all of mathematics. And in some sense, that is the reason why it has to grow as quickly
1775160	1789880	as it does. Yes, that is what I said. I don't know how to answer that question. Okay. I mean,
1789880	1795160	it's kind of like saying, you know, you said why two plus two is four, but how is it four?
1796120	1798200	It's like, you know, I don't know what to do with that.
1801320	1802120	Okay. Yeah.
1802120	1805720	Hi, Dr. Aronson. Quick question. You were just at the Institute of Advanced Study.
1805720	1806520	Yes.
1806520	1809880	I was wondering if there were any interesting takeaways, anything that you found interesting
1809880	1811400	there? Want to hear your thoughts?
1811400	1818040	Yeah. No, it was super interesting. You know, I was at the meeting of this community called
1818120	1823960	It From Cubit. And, you know, there were a lot of talks, actually,
1825960	1831880	both about quantum gravity, about the black hole information problem, but also talks about
1831880	1837400	quantum computing theory from, you know, about quantum supremacy experiments and so forth from
1837400	1847800	Umesh Vazirani spoke and others who might be familiar to some people here. You know,
1847800	1854520	there was a very nice talk by Bill Fefferman about a new notion called pseudo entanglement.
1854520	1860600	So they've now shown how you can prepare quantum states that are indistinguishable
1860600	1864600	from highly entangled states, even though they're not highly entangled,
1864600	1868040	even though the amount of entanglement in them is actually very small.
1868680	1872760	That seems like a potentially useful notion. You know, again, it could be useful for all
1872760	1878920	sorts of purposes just within quantum information, but their motivation for it originally came
1878920	1883720	from quantum gravity. So it's been kind of amazing to see how these two fields have come
1883720	1890520	together. Now, there was a discussion, and I should say some dispute at this workshop about this
1890520	1898840	recent experiment that, you know, some people have misstated as having created a wormhole
1898840	1908600	on the Google Sycamore chip. And I think, you know, no one who understands actually disagrees
1908600	1913560	about the relevant facts, which is, you know, it's just some nine qubit quantum circuit,
1914600	1920040	but they disagree about how to talk about it. You know, some people say, well, we should praise it,
1920280	1926680	you know, it's exciting, and maybe it'll lead to more in the future. And others of us
1926680	1930920	are very concerned that, you know, if the public gets the impression that, you know,
1930920	1937640	these physicists are claiming to have, you know, opened up a wormhole in the lab,
1937640	1942440	and then they learn the details and they find out that it is, you know, nothing at all like
1942440	1947560	they thought it was, then, you know, they're going to lose trust in the enterprise of physics itself.
1947640	1952760	And, you know, and so we ought to be very, very clear about what has and hasn't actually been
1952760	1962360	accomplished. So I have a question. So the Nobel Prize was awarded for entanglement this year?
1962360	1969240	Yes. Do you think that topic is closed or there's still very interesting research around entanglement,
1969240	1975720	like emergent effects for a million qubits, for example? Yeah, I think that entanglement
1975720	1981800	as a whole is sort of a permanent part of physics, right? It is, you know, I mean, everything that
1981800	1987640	we do in quantum computing, you know, whether we mention it explicitly or not, right, we are,
1987640	1994680	you know, trying to understand, you know, what you can do with these highly entangled states
1994680	2000280	on millions of qubits. Those questions are not going away. Okay, now this Nobel Prize
2000280	2005880	was specifically for, you know, the experiments that sort of demonstrated the reality of two
2005880	2013160	particle entanglement, like, for example, via the violation of the Bell inequality or the CHSH
2013160	2019080	inequality, right? And, you know, that's something that many of us have thought was a way overdue
2019080	2024520	Nobel Prize, right? It could have been given 20 or 30 years ago, but it's, you know, like usual,
2024520	2029880	the way to, you know, to win, you know, the Nobel Prize in physics is like a biathlon,
2029880	2036200	right? You have to, one, do something that deserves the Nobel Prize, and then two, stay alive for long
2036200	2046360	enough, right? But, okay, but I would say that in terms of the violation of the Bell inequality,
2046360	2052440	you know, I would say with the experiments in 2015, which simultaneously closed the
2052440	2058600	locality loophole and the detection loophole, I would say that all of the quote-unquote sane
2058600	2065960	loopholes to the Bell inequality violation have now been closed. Okay, all that remains
2065960	2071720	is the utterly insane loophole, which is called superdeterminism, right? Which is basically the
2071720	2078280	idea that, like, if you just treated the entire universe as a conspiracy theory, right, and said
2078280	2083880	that, you know, ever since the Big Bang, it was predetermined what experiments we were going to do
2083880	2089880	and so forth, then you can explain away the violation of the Bell inequality, but then, you
2089880	2095480	know, you're like, the cure is a billion times worse than the disease, right? So, you know, I think
2095480	2102040	that, you know, insofar as physics can ever establish anything, I think that with the fully
2102120	2108040	loophole-free Bell experiments, yes, it has now established the physical reality of quantum
2108040	2111160	entanglement, and we can at least move on from that question.
2113080	2118680	Related to your work right now in AI safety, what can we learn from your experience there
2118680	2124680	on quantum safety in a much more early stage than we addressed it in AI?
2125640	2135080	Well, I mean, you know, I'm not confident that quantum safety, you know, really raises kind
2135080	2141400	of novel issues, you know, that are different from those raised by classical safety, right? I mean,
2141400	2146600	you know, you want to, like, you know, I like to say, you know, a quantum computer is not exactly
2146600	2152440	like a nuclear weapon, right? It probably won't kill anyone unless the dilution refrigerator
2152440	2158920	tips over onto them or something like that, right? You know, I mean, I mean, certainly,
2158920	2165080	there will be national security issues that come into play once you have scalable quantum computers
2165080	2171960	that can break public key crypto systems, okay? And those are already being discussed,
2171960	2176920	you know, sort of in principle, we know how to respond to those things, you know, with the
2177000	2182920	post-quantum cryptography, but, you know, it will be a struggle to get everyone to adopt that
2182920	2188760	and to sort of agree on standards for that. You know, I mean, that's the closest that I can
2188760	2195960	think of to a quantum safety issue, right, is just the move to post-quantum cryptography.
2195960	2201000	You know, other than that, you could say it's just, you know, a new kind of computer that will be,
2201000	2209720	you know, super fast for certain things. You know, now with AI, you know, the worry specifically is,
2209720	2215560	you know, you give, you slightly mis-specify what its goal is, and then it's intelligent enough to
2215560	2220680	think creatively about how to accomplish that goal, even if that means plotting against you,
2220680	2223720	or, you know, doing something wildly different from what you intended.
