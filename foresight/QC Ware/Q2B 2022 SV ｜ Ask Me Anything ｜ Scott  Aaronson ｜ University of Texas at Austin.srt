00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,400
Hi everyone, great to see you all at Q2B, and very excited to be closing this out.

2
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:14,440
My name is Anastasia Marcinkova, I'm a research engineer, scientist at Bleximo, and I've spent

3
00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:19,920
the last decade in various parts of quantum computing and information from neutral atoms,

4
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:22,360
trapped ions, and now in superconducting qubits.

5
00:00:22,360 --> 00:00:28,240
And I'm very excited, you know, 10 years ago I was taking the physics GRE, and very sad

6
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:31,960
about my scores, wondering if I get into grad school, and this year I get to be up on stage

7
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:35,400
with Scott Aaronson.

8
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:38,840
I've never taken a physics GRE, I'm not sure I could pass one.

9
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:43,480
Oh wow, okay, well, go, so tell us a little bit about yourself and your latest work.

10
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:52,720
Well, I took the computer science GRE, I came into quantum computing entirely from the math

11
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:59,000
and CS direction, and got very excited that it was just vectors and matrices, you know,

12
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,560
that was all I needed to know to start working on quantum algorithms.

13
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:07,720
Now, eventually, after I'd been in this field for long enough and hung out with enough physicists,

14
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:12,520
at some point I picked up what a Hamiltonian was, and then I learned what a Boson and a

15
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:17,640
Fermion was, now I'm trying to learn what ADS-CFT is, and then, you know, a little bit

16
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:20,040
about what a black hole is.

17
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:25,360
Okay, but, you know, I just sort of pick up my physics on the streets.

18
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:33,560
Now, in terms of my recent work, I happened to be on leave this year from my normal job

19
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:40,640
at, you know, teaching computer science at UT Austin, I am working for OpenAI, which

20
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:48,000
is based in San Francisco, on the theoretical foundations of AI safety, okay, such as if

21
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:53,520
any of you have tried out a GPT, you know, how can we prevent it from being misused?

22
00:01:53,520 --> 00:02:00,760
How can we prevent every student in the world from using it to write their term paper, okay?

23
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:06,960
So, you know, that has very little to do with quantum computing, and I, you know, quantum

24
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:13,320
computing was my first love, and I intend to come back to it, but yeah, that's some

25
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:19,360
of what I've been thinking about, you know, and I also continue to work with my students

26
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:26,960
in postdocs, we have some neat projects, one of them about reconstructing the bulk in quantum

27
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:34,400
gravity, continue to think about quantum supremacy experiments, how can we make them easier to

28
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:41,200
verify the results using a classical computer, you know, how can we use them for, you know,

29
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:47,640
certified random bits, or for other purposes, so yeah, those are the quantum things that

30
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:49,680
I continue to think about.

31
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:54,000
Great, so we're definitely going to get a little bit into the wormholes and the work

32
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,080
at OpenAI, but first I want to talk a little bit about the quantum space, and what do you

33
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:01,800
think are the most exciting developments this year in the quantum space?

34
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:07,120
Yeah, well, I mean, a major milestone in the past year was the proof of the so-called

35
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:14,960
NLTS conjecture, which showed how entanglement can survive even at finite temperature, you

36
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:20,960
know, like very large amounts of entanglement, it's, you know, a major step toward potentially

37
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:27,640
proving this quantum PCP theorem, which has, you know, been a central problem in the field

38
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:30,320
since 2005 or so.

39
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:39,120
Now, I was also super excited this past spring by a breakthrough of Yamakawa and Janshree,

40
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:45,360
and so they've given sort of an entirely new type of exponential quantum speedup, not

41
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:55,360
yet for a directly useful problem, but it is an exponential quantum speedup for a search

42
00:03:55,360 --> 00:04:01,360
problem, so a problem with verifiable solutions, and which works relative to a random oracle.

43
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:08,160
Okay, so a random oracle, you know, is a sort of idealized object, but you can substitute

44
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:11,480
it in real life using a pseudo-random function.

45
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:16,360
Okay, so their proposal leads to an experiment that, you know, I mean, if you had, you would

46
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:21,520
need a fault-tolerant quantum computer, the same kind that you would need for Shor's algorithm,

47
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:27,040
for example, but, you know, if so, you know, this is sort of an entirely new class of exponential

48
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:34,000
quantum speedups, different from, you know, the kind in Shor's algorithm, for example,

49
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:40,040
and I think, you know, it's opened up a whole new avenue of possibilities to play with.

50
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:48,480
Now, there's been progress in the past year in understanding quantum algorithms for homology

51
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:55,520
problems, for, you know, topological data analysis, both positive and negative.

52
00:04:55,520 --> 00:05:04,000
There have been some de-quantizations of these topological data analysis algorithms.

53
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:14,120
There's also, like, approximately a QMA hardness for Klee homology, due to, in part to Marcos,

54
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:23,440
who now works at QCWare, so, you know, so we're getting a better understanding of that.

55
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:27,880
There has been progress on quantum supremacy experiments.

56
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:37,640
Xanadu did a Gaussian boson sampling experiment in the past year with a photon number resolving

57
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:43,240
detectors and, you know, tunable beam splitters and hundreds of photons.

58
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:48,480
So that was cool, and I think, you know, established a state of the art there.

59
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:53,320
But there's also been progress in a negative direction, as many of you have seen.

60
00:05:53,320 --> 00:06:00,280
Classical computer scientists have gotten better at figuring out how to take the random

61
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:06,200
circuit sampling experiments, for example, and spoof them classically.

62
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:14,960
So I would especially mention work by Zhun Gao and Belaz Barak and others at Harvard,

63
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:22,220
and also some very new work by Darita Harinov and Umesh Vazharani and others that have given

64
00:06:22,220 --> 00:06:30,000
algorithms, you know, that, you know, I would say leave the quantum advantage that was achieved

65
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,920
by Google a few years ago.

66
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:36,240
You know, they leave it still standing because, you know, either they're less efficient or

67
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:41,640
else they get a benchmark and this linear cross entropy score that is not as good as

68
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:48,120
what the Google experiment demonstrated, okay, but they leave the claim of quantum supremacy

69
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:53,560
standing more precariously than I would like, okay, and I would say that the ball is now

70
00:06:53,560 --> 00:07:01,040
firmly in the court of the experimentalists to do better quantum supremacy experiments

71
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:05,520
with better gate fidelities, for example, that will put more distance because, you know,

72
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:11,840
we would like quantum supremacy not only to have been achieved, but to stay achieved,

73
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:18,920
okay, so that's been another thing, yes, so those are some of the developments in the

74
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:19,920
last year.

75
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:27,720
I mean, there was major progress in understanding, I think, the relation of quantum computing

76
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:34,440
theory to the black hole information problem worked by Daniel Harlow and Netta Engelhardt

77
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:39,080
and so forth involving non-isometric codes, you know, and that's lead to all sorts of

78
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:44,560
open questions that are interesting to people like me, you know, even if we don't know,

79
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:51,280
you know, even if we didn't care about black holes or string theory or anything like that,

80
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:57,160
but you know, in terms of the more practical developments, yeah, I think, you know, those

81
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:59,880
are some of the developments that most excited me.

82
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:04,320
Yeah, definitely, so I loved reading your last blog post, I know we've all been busy

83
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:08,920
with the conference, but I highly recommend reading it, it was a great, great analysis

84
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:14,760
of this, but let's dive in more to the quantum supremacy, so in 2019, Google had the Quantum

85
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:19,160
Advantage experiment, a few other groups, you mentioned Zandu carried out their own

86
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:24,080
experiments, but these experiments are really not free of that criticism, and on that blog,

87
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:28,120
you talked about the random circuit sampling, and even though the authors themselves did

88
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:33,200
not claim breaking Quantum Advantage, some other people say that it might have refuted

89
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:37,640
that, so how do we actually clearly establish quantum supremacy, and what do you think is

90
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:40,440
what we need to do to get to that phase?

91
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:49,440
Yeah, well, I think that, you know, often it's just a matter of reading what the paper

92
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:56,480
actually says, rather than just trying to get some kind of vague zeitgeist or vague feeling

93
00:08:56,760 --> 00:09:03,760
about it, so the thing is, from the very beginning of this quest to demonstrate quantum advantage

94
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:12,520
supremacy, whatever, in the NISC era, we knew that we were playing a game where, fundamentally,

95
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:20,520
it doesn't scale, right, like we might be able to do this with 50 qubits or 100 qubits,

96
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:27,520
but you're not going to scale to 1,000 qubits, because if you did, then presumably you would

97
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:34,360
want an enormous circuit depth to get all your qubits to talk to each other, but the

98
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:38,920
signal that you can read out when you make a measurement, if your qubits are not error

99
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:44,720
corrected, then your signal is going to degrade exponentially as a function of the depth,

100
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:49,720
right, so when the depth becomes too large, you just can't read the signal anymore, your

101
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:56,720
signal to noise ratio is negligible, so we knew that ultimately what you need is quantum

102
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:03,880
error correction, right, and hopefully, you know, that message has come through loud and

103
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:10,280
clear through many of the talks that you've been to over the past three days, right, ultimately

104
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:15,840
scaling will require error correction, okay, so we've been playing a game where we hope

105
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:22,600
to eke out, you know, some advantage before that era, that, you know, that at least puts

106
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:27,360
the ball in the skeptics court, right, at least makes it, you know, gives them the challenge

107
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:31,480
of saying, okay, if you don't believe that quantum computing can ever work, right, well,

108
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:37,440
it seems like, you know, how do you explain the results of this experiment, right, without

109
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:42,720
talking about a two to the 50th dimensional Hilbert space, you know, that was actually

110
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:47,360
involved in the computation, right, you know, just today I was arguing with people on my

111
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:53,400
blog who were, you know, you know, and making this point, right, I think these experiments

112
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:59,960
have put the ball in their court, and that was the original point, right, so now what

113
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:06,400
the new work by Harinov-Vazharani at all, what that has done is to sort of nail down

114
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:13,320
the conclusion a little bit more rigorously, that indeed, you know, it's not going to scale,

115
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:19,040
you know, the quantum advantage will not scale to more and more qubits without error correction.

116
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:23,960
There was a little loophole in that statement that we, you know, did not know how to rigorously

117
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:29,560
justify, namely, like, what about when the circuit depth is neither too large nor too

118
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:37,560
small, like, you know, if the circuit depth is constant, then we, you know, and the gates

119
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:43,400
are geometrically local, then we know how to simulate the thing using tensor network methods,

120
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:48,040
if the circuit depth is too high, then, you know, the noise is too great, okay, but if

121
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:52,680
the circuit depth was like logarithmic in the number of qubits, then we didn't know

122
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:59,640
how to rule out that random circuit sampling could give you a quantum advantage even that

123
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:05,240
would scale to arbitrary numbers of qubits with no error correction, and so, you know,

124
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:10,040
using sophisticated techniques, they've now ruled that out, okay, but it's important to

125
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:15,960
understand that, you know, this proves a conjecture that, you know, everyone in the working in the

126
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:21,720
field, I think, would have made. It doesn't disprove a conjecture, okay, so, yeah.

127
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:29,560
Okay, great. So how do we get there, I guess? So what fields do you think in the quantum space

128
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:35,880
have been over-served versus under-served? You and I probably remember very well the QAOA craze

129
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:43,640
a few years ago where every paper, you know, every day was QAOA. Is that over? You're speaking

130
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:48,040
about it in the past 10. I know, well, maybe, but I'm seeing less of it these days.

131
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:56,520
All right. Some of the years were a lot, but yeah, have we gone to deep in QAOA? Or not deep enough

132
00:12:56,520 --> 00:13:01,080
in other parts that will get us to that quantum supremacy that we need? Yeah, well, I mean,

133
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:08,520
the kind of thing that I always want to see less of is, you know, the papers where they say, you

134
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:13,960
know, we do such and such with a quantum computer, right? We show how you can do

135
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:21,400
machine learning, optimization, finance, this or that, and they don't even ask the question of,

136
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:26,040
well, how does it compare against, you know, what you could have done with a classical computer,

137
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:32,200
right? And where sort of the entire case seems to depend on just no one, you know, everyone

138
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:37,560
tacitly agreeing to not ask that question, right? You know, as obvious as that sounds,

139
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:44,040
you know, I feel like that still describes like at least 15 to 20 percent of all of the papers

140
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:49,240
that I see on the Quant PH archive, okay? And I'm always hoping to see less of that.

141
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:54,600
Now, you know, in terms of what I'd like to see more of, right? I mean,

142
00:13:56,040 --> 00:14:02,520
yeah, I mean, I always get interested when I see a paper that just sort of steps back and, you know,

143
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:07,160
looks for a new kind of quantum speedup, you know, just like that this example by

144
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:13,320
the work by Yamakawa and Jantree that I mentioned earlier, right? Even if it's not immediately

145
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:19,560
useful for anything that I can see, right? You know, I'm way more excited about a new kind,

146
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:27,000
you know, a sort of fundamental new source of quantum speedup, you know, that then we can

147
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:32,280
think about what it is good for. Then I am about, you know, someone who starts with, you know,

148
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:38,920
what they want, like some, you know, finance application or some vehicle routing application,

149
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:46,040
and then, you know, tries to, you know, say, well, here's the quantum algorithm to do it. And,

150
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:53,560
you know, and as long as no one asks too hard about, you know, how, as long as no one pushes too

151
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:58,760
hard on how well could we have done the same thing classically, you know, we can impress people by

152
00:14:58,760 --> 00:15:04,360
saying that we did this with a quantum computer. So we've talked a lot about the algorithm side,

153
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:08,760
but what about the hardware side? Have you seen any great accomplishments this year? And what are

154
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:13,160
you kind of looking for that canary in the coal mine of when you're going to start getting really

155
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:18,680
excited about this being actually applied to hardware? Well, look, I mean, I mean, I've been

156
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:23,960
excited enough for 20 plus years to, you know, spend my career working in this field, right?

157
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:37,080
So, but, you know, with, you know, quantum, the sort of first quantum supremacy experiments now,

158
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:43,560
you know, three years old, I think, you know, it's clear to most people in the field what the next

159
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:51,160
steps are, you know, you know, demonstrate quantum error correction, just keep a, a logical qubit

160
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:57,880
alive for a long time, you know, demonstrate that you can do that, you know, against both X errors

161
00:15:57,880 --> 00:16:04,040
and Z errors, you know, that you can do fault tolerant operations, you know, of course, many

162
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:09,560
groups are working or racing toward trying to demonstrate that. But I would also stress,

163
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:16,680
you know, do better quantum supremacy experiments, you know, I do not regard that as a done deal,

164
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:22,600
right? Because, you know, again, classical spoofers have gotten better and better, right? Now, on the,

165
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:28,200
you know, what I would really like, you know, this is, unfortunately, you know, when the hardware

166
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:33,800
people come, you know, this is something that we have not yet managed to solve for them. But to

167
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:40,120
figure out how to do near term quantum supremacy experiments where the answer can also be

168
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:46,040
efficiently verified using a classical computer, right, where you don't have to calculate this

169
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:52,040
linear cross entropy score, which takes an exponential amount of time on a classical computer

170
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:57,720
in order to verify the results. I, you know, I think, you know, the, the current generation

171
00:16:57,720 --> 00:17:03,160
of quantum supremacy experiments are inherently limited to, you know, 60 qubits, let's say,

172
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:07,720
because beyond that, we don't even know how to verify the answer. So, you know, I'm, you know,

173
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:14,120
I have some ideas for how we're going to go beyond that. But I think that will really take a new idea.

174
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:20,040
Great. So one last question for me before we get back to the audience and,

175
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:23,880
you know, obviously for everyone else, you know, send your quantum supremacy experiments to Scott

176
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:29,400
to check up on before, so you don't get a blog post about your paper, or maybe you want that.

177
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:35,720
So you've done amazing work at OpenAI so far, and, you know, a big question is,

178
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:40,120
are you coming back to quantum? When are you coming back? And are you going to take any

179
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:48,440
learnings back? Yeah, I mean, I guess I never really left. Don't tell my bosses at OpenAI that,

180
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:56,280
but I, you know, I mean, I still, you know, I'm based in Austin mostly. I still run my research

181
00:17:56,280 --> 00:18:03,160
group. I supervise my, you know, students and postdocs. We continue to write quantum computing

182
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:08,680
papers. But, you know, I'm not, I'm not teaching this year. And so I am, you know, spending the

183
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:14,280
majority of my time thinking about AI safety. You know, I mean, I mean, quantum computing,

184
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:19,480
in some sense, was my first love. You know, when I was a beginning grad student in 2000,

185
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:24,280
I was actually deciding then whether to go into quantum computing or machine learning.

186
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:31,000
Those were, those were my two main choices. And, you know, I already had a sense then that

187
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:36,520
machine learning was going to be societally important on a shorter time scale. You know,

188
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:41,240
this was a decade before the deep learning revolution started, right? So I didn't even

189
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:46,360
know how important, but, you know, it seemed like, and yet quantum computing was just more fun,

190
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:52,040
okay? Because, you know, with machine learning, kind of everything was messy and empirical,

191
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:57,640
right? And, you know, you could just sort of stare at graphs and try to, you know, infer what

192
00:18:57,640 --> 00:19:02,760
was going on. But there was never any theory to explain it. And with quantum computing, even

193
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:08,840
though we were so far from having the actual devices, you know, we could understand so much

194
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:14,040
about the various quantum algorithms and why they worked or didn't work. And so,

195
00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:21,560
you know, 20-some years later, I still feel like quantum computing is more fun. And so, you know,

196
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:28,600
I don't know. But, you know, I just, I tend to get drawn to problems that are fun,

197
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:33,240
as opposed to having any kind of coherent plan for, you know, what I'm going to work on.

198
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:40,280
All right. Well, thank you so much for answering my questions. And now we'd like to open it up to

199
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:43,640
the audience. So ask all your questions for Scott.

200
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:57,640
Hello, Scott. Hi. It's an honor. I wanted to ask you what are your thoughts on, I mean,

201
00:19:57,640 --> 00:20:01,400
it's an open question, but what are your thoughts on the classes of problems that are

202
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:05,400
quantumly easy and classically hard to solve? So, to be a bit more specific,

203
00:20:06,520 --> 00:20:13,160
using near-term devices, what area do you think quantum computing can have the most impact on?

204
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:20,600
Yeah. So our best bet for near-term devices, you know, remains what it was when

205
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:25,160
Feynman started talking about quantum computing 40 years ago, right? Namely,

206
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:32,040
simulating quantum physics, right? Learning more about materials, about chemistry, as we heard

207
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:39,080
in the very nice talk by Brigitte Whaley this morning. You know, learning about reaction rates,

208
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:45,720
you know, hopefully, you know, learning about condensed matter physics, maybe even learning

209
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:50,600
about quantum gravity. You know, for anyone who's wondering, I do not think we learned anything

210
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:55,880
new from this nine-qubit simulation of a wormhole, quote-unquote. We did open one?

211
00:20:55,880 --> 00:21:01,880
We didn't open a wormhole. Yeah. Well, if we did open a wormhole, then it's in a different universe,

212
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:07,800
you know, not one that we have any access to, right? But, you know, so other people might

213
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:12,760
equivalently describe the situation by just saying we ran a little quantum circuit on nine

214
00:21:12,760 --> 00:21:18,920
qubits, right? And we knew perfectly well what the outcome was going to be. So, I mean, this is,

215
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:24,360
you know, like, when this is the thing, like, when you do, you know, when you sort of design a

216
00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:30,040
quantum circuit or a quantum protocol, but then you feel like, well, maybe people won't, you know,

217
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:35,400
pay enough attention or it won't get into nature, you know, unless I actually run it on a quantum

218
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:41,160
computer, even though I know full well what the result is going to be, like, this has less of the

219
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:51,640
character of an experiment, more the character of a PR stunt, right? And so, but having said that,

220
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:57,960
you know, once you can scale up to devices with, you know, 100 qubits, 200 qubits, you know,

221
00:21:57,960 --> 00:22:03,720
we will be able to test out models of condensed matter physics, even, you know, theoretical

222
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:08,200
models of quantum gravity in a way that might tell us something that we didn't already know,

223
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:14,840
and that is genuinely an interesting prospect. And ironically, one of the earliest things that

224
00:22:14,840 --> 00:22:21,720
we might be able to do with quantum computers, just because, you know, with chemistry, for example,

225
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:26,360
there's all sorts of messy details that you have to get right because you have to match observed

226
00:22:26,360 --> 00:22:30,440
reality, right? With quantum gravity, you can just make up the model.

227
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:37,800
I always joke that a first quantum computer may build a better quantum computer.

228
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:43,560
Yes. Well, yeah, okay, so you could say that that's the other main, main application of near

229
00:22:43,560 --> 00:22:48,840
term quantum computers, namely, learn about the problem of building a quantum computer, right?

230
00:22:48,840 --> 00:22:53,720
It's kind of like the main application of sending humans to space, right, which is to learn about

231
00:22:53,720 --> 00:23:02,680
how to send humans into space. Hi, Scott. Over here? Yeah. No, over to your left. Hi. Hi. Mark

232
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:08,440
Masingly Scott, it's my name. I have a question about, you mentioned that quantum computing is

233
00:23:09,080 --> 00:23:15,000
interesting because it's fun. My question is about the commercialization of quantum computing.

234
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:20,120
Do you think about that? What do you think about that? And I won't ask you the question,

235
00:23:20,680 --> 00:23:24,920
when do you think it's going to be commercially viable? Because the answer is always in five years.

236
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:29,160
But what do you think is going to happen between now and it actually becoming commercially viable?

237
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:36,280
So I certainly think about it. I mean, often I'm thinking about it in the context of someone has

238
00:23:36,280 --> 00:23:43,560
claimed to have something that is already commercially useful. And it's based on statements

239
00:23:43,560 --> 00:23:49,880
that are insofar as we can evaluate them seem to be false. And then I get emails

240
00:23:49,880 --> 00:24:01,160
about it. And then I have to write a blog post about it. But I think that I am cautiously optimistic

241
00:24:01,160 --> 00:24:08,920
that within the next decade, we will see the first quantum computations that are actually useful

242
00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:14,200
for learning about various quantum systems. I think maybe first we will see things that are

243
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:19,960
scientifically interesting, or that teach us something new about materials. And then maybe

244
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:25,880
we will start to see things that are also commercially interesting. What tends to irk me

245
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:35,160
is when people are seeming to jump the cue here, where we haven't even clearly established the

246
00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:41,320
reality of any quantum speed up at all, even for something completely useless, let alone for

247
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:46,520
something scientifically interesting, let alone for something commercially useful. And then they're

248
00:24:46,520 --> 00:24:58,600
already talking about working with Volkswagen to optimize vehicle routing. If you were actually

249
00:24:58,600 --> 00:25:03,720
going to beat classical here, then you would have been able to do all of these earlier steps in the

250
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:11,800
process, which are still huge, unsolved challenges. So that tends to be my feeling about it. Now,

251
00:25:12,760 --> 00:25:19,320
when I look at the various quantum startups today, some of them I'm actually very enthusiastic about.

252
00:25:19,320 --> 00:25:27,640
And I hope that they, I'm not like investing my own money in them. But then again, I'm not a

253
00:25:27,640 --> 00:25:35,720
venture capitalist. My money is just sits in the bank doing nothing. Certainly there are startups

254
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:44,040
where I feel like they're taking a big risk, but I hope that they succeed. But usually when I'm

255
00:25:44,040 --> 00:25:50,200
asked to judge some startup, like I'm judging something different than maybe most people would,

256
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:56,920
which is I'm looking at, I can't judge all kinds of things about the quantum computing startups

257
00:25:56,920 --> 00:26:03,880
about their hardware, about their plans for the future. I can just judge the statements that they

258
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:10,440
make now about quantum algorithms and see if they're true or not. Or if they let they comport

259
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:18,520
with no knowledge. And if they're saying things that I know are false or wildly exaggerated,

260
00:26:18,520 --> 00:26:23,880
then that gives me less confidence, of course, about the parts that I can't judge. And conversely,

261
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:27,320
if they're careful about the things I can judge, then I have more confidence.

262
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:41,160
Hi. Oh, sorry. You had mentioned, can you hear me? It's working. I can hear. Okay. You had mentioned

263
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:48,760
in the 20 years ago, when you were deciding to go one way or another. And during that time,

264
00:26:48,760 --> 00:26:56,680
you wrote a very interesting paper on who can name the biggest number. And therein,

265
00:26:56,680 --> 00:27:04,360
you discussed the busy beaver problem and how huge it gets. But you never mentioned in there

266
00:27:04,360 --> 00:27:11,000
how it gets so big. I mean, you mentioned in there Rado who invented it in the game 1960.

267
00:27:11,560 --> 00:27:18,040
And if I remember right, he said beaver busy number four or five is something humanity can never

268
00:27:18,040 --> 00:27:25,080
know. Well, busy beaver five, we might know. In fact, there's a conjecture that it's about 47

269
00:27:25,080 --> 00:27:33,080
million. Busy beaver of six is at least 10 to the 10 to the 10 to the 10 to the 10 and so on 15

270
00:27:33,080 --> 00:27:39,080
times. And there is my question in that paper. Yes. You mentioned that intriguing effect, but you

271
00:27:39,080 --> 00:27:42,600
never explained how it gets so big. How's that possible? Okay. All right. All right. Fine. Well,

272
00:27:43,080 --> 00:27:48,040
this question has nothing to do with quantum computing. Let's be clear. Ask me anything,

273
00:27:48,040 --> 00:27:53,320
though, right? Yeah. Fine. Fine. Fine. I didn't say I didn't say I didn't say I wasn't going to

274
00:27:53,320 --> 00:28:03,400
answer it. So by the way, I would not have mentioned in 1999 that busy beaver of six is that enormous

275
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:07,320
because that wasn't known at the time. Okay. That was only discovered actually within the

276
00:28:07,320 --> 00:28:16,280
past year, which is kind of a cool discovery. So the busy beaver of n is defined as the largest

277
00:28:16,280 --> 00:28:22,040
finite number of steps that can be taken by a Turing machine with n steps. So basically think

278
00:28:22,040 --> 00:28:29,400
of like the largest number of things that an n-bit computer program can do if it has to halt

279
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:36,440
afterward. And what you can prove is that this function as a function of n grows faster than

280
00:28:36,440 --> 00:28:43,800
any computable function. We know that because if it were computable, then you could use that to

281
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:50,120
solve the halting problem, which Alan Turing proved was impossible. So in some sense, that gives you

282
00:28:50,120 --> 00:28:56,360
the abstract reason why it has to grow ridiculously fast because otherwise you could use it to solve

283
00:28:56,360 --> 00:29:01,080
the halting problem. Okay. But if you want to be a little more concrete, you could say, look, you

284
00:29:01,080 --> 00:29:09,000
can encode and actually someone did this not long ago. You can build a 27 state Turing machine

285
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:14,840
that halts if and only if there is a counter example to the Goldbuck conjecture. It says every

286
00:29:14,840 --> 00:29:21,560
even number four greater is the sum of two primes. And so in order to know even just busy beaver of

287
00:29:21,560 --> 00:29:29,880
27, you would have to settle Goldbuck's conjecture. Okay. So this one function encodes in it a large

288
00:29:29,960 --> 00:29:35,160
fraction of all of mathematics. And in some sense, that is the reason why it has to grow as quickly

289
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:49,880
as it does. Yes, that is what I said. I don't know how to answer that question. Okay. I mean,

290
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:55,160
it's kind of like saying, you know, you said why two plus two is four, but how is it four?

291
00:29:56,120 --> 00:29:58,200
It's like, you know, I don't know what to do with that.

292
00:30:01,320 --> 00:30:02,120
Okay. Yeah.

293
00:30:02,120 --> 00:30:05,720
Hi, Dr. Aronson. Quick question. You were just at the Institute of Advanced Study.

294
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:06,520
Yes.

295
00:30:06,520 --> 00:30:09,880
I was wondering if there were any interesting takeaways, anything that you found interesting

296
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:11,400
there? Want to hear your thoughts?

297
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:18,040
Yeah. No, it was super interesting. You know, I was at the meeting of this community called

298
00:30:18,120 --> 00:30:23,960
It From Cubit. And, you know, there were a lot of talks, actually,

299
00:30:25,960 --> 00:30:31,880
both about quantum gravity, about the black hole information problem, but also talks about

300
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:37,400
quantum computing theory from, you know, about quantum supremacy experiments and so forth from

301
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:47,800
Umesh Vazirani spoke and others who might be familiar to some people here. You know,

302
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:54,520
there was a very nice talk by Bill Fefferman about a new notion called pseudo entanglement.

303
00:30:54,520 --> 00:31:00,600
So they've now shown how you can prepare quantum states that are indistinguishable

304
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:04,600
from highly entangled states, even though they're not highly entangled,

305
00:31:04,600 --> 00:31:08,040
even though the amount of entanglement in them is actually very small.

306
00:31:08,680 --> 00:31:12,760
That seems like a potentially useful notion. You know, again, it could be useful for all

307
00:31:12,760 --> 00:31:18,920
sorts of purposes just within quantum information, but their motivation for it originally came

308
00:31:18,920 --> 00:31:23,720
from quantum gravity. So it's been kind of amazing to see how these two fields have come

309
00:31:23,720 --> 00:31:30,520
together. Now, there was a discussion, and I should say some dispute at this workshop about this

310
00:31:30,520 --> 00:31:38,840
recent experiment that, you know, some people have misstated as having created a wormhole

311
00:31:38,840 --> 00:31:48,600
on the Google Sycamore chip. And I think, you know, no one who understands actually disagrees

312
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:53,560
about the relevant facts, which is, you know, it's just some nine qubit quantum circuit,

313
00:31:54,600 --> 00:32:00,040
but they disagree about how to talk about it. You know, some people say, well, we should praise it,

314
00:32:00,280 --> 00:32:06,680
you know, it's exciting, and maybe it'll lead to more in the future. And others of us

315
00:32:06,680 --> 00:32:10,920
are very concerned that, you know, if the public gets the impression that, you know,

316
00:32:10,920 --> 00:32:17,640
these physicists are claiming to have, you know, opened up a wormhole in the lab,

317
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:22,440
and then they learn the details and they find out that it is, you know, nothing at all like

318
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:27,560
they thought it was, then, you know, they're going to lose trust in the enterprise of physics itself.

319
00:32:27,640 --> 00:32:32,760
And, you know, and so we ought to be very, very clear about what has and hasn't actually been

320
00:32:32,760 --> 00:32:42,360
accomplished. So I have a question. So the Nobel Prize was awarded for entanglement this year?

321
00:32:42,360 --> 00:32:49,240
Yes. Do you think that topic is closed or there's still very interesting research around entanglement,

322
00:32:49,240 --> 00:32:55,720
like emergent effects for a million qubits, for example? Yeah, I think that entanglement

323
00:32:55,720 --> 00:33:01,800
as a whole is sort of a permanent part of physics, right? It is, you know, I mean, everything that

324
00:33:01,800 --> 00:33:07,640
we do in quantum computing, you know, whether we mention it explicitly or not, right, we are,

325
00:33:07,640 --> 00:33:14,680
you know, trying to understand, you know, what you can do with these highly entangled states

326
00:33:14,680 --> 00:33:20,280
on millions of qubits. Those questions are not going away. Okay, now this Nobel Prize

327
00:33:20,280 --> 00:33:25,880
was specifically for, you know, the experiments that sort of demonstrated the reality of two

328
00:33:25,880 --> 00:33:33,160
particle entanglement, like, for example, via the violation of the Bell inequality or the CHSH

329
00:33:33,160 --> 00:33:39,080
inequality, right? And, you know, that's something that many of us have thought was a way overdue

330
00:33:39,080 --> 00:33:44,520
Nobel Prize, right? It could have been given 20 or 30 years ago, but it's, you know, like usual,

331
00:33:44,520 --> 00:33:49,880
the way to, you know, to win, you know, the Nobel Prize in physics is like a biathlon,

332
00:33:49,880 --> 00:33:56,200
right? You have to, one, do something that deserves the Nobel Prize, and then two, stay alive for long

333
00:33:56,200 --> 00:34:06,360
enough, right? But, okay, but I would say that in terms of the violation of the Bell inequality,

334
00:34:06,360 --> 00:34:12,440
you know, I would say with the experiments in 2015, which simultaneously closed the

335
00:34:12,440 --> 00:34:18,600
locality loophole and the detection loophole, I would say that all of the quote-unquote sane

336
00:34:18,600 --> 00:34:25,960
loopholes to the Bell inequality violation have now been closed. Okay, all that remains

337
00:34:25,960 --> 00:34:31,720
is the utterly insane loophole, which is called superdeterminism, right? Which is basically the

338
00:34:31,720 --> 00:34:38,280
idea that, like, if you just treated the entire universe as a conspiracy theory, right, and said

339
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:43,880
that, you know, ever since the Big Bang, it was predetermined what experiments we were going to do

340
00:34:43,880 --> 00:34:49,880
and so forth, then you can explain away the violation of the Bell inequality, but then, you

341
00:34:49,880 --> 00:34:55,480
know, you're like, the cure is a billion times worse than the disease, right? So, you know, I think

342
00:34:55,480 --> 00:35:02,040
that, you know, insofar as physics can ever establish anything, I think that with the fully

343
00:35:02,120 --> 00:35:08,040
loophole-free Bell experiments, yes, it has now established the physical reality of quantum

344
00:35:08,040 --> 00:35:11,160
entanglement, and we can at least move on from that question.

345
00:35:13,080 --> 00:35:18,680
Related to your work right now in AI safety, what can we learn from your experience there

346
00:35:18,680 --> 00:35:24,680
on quantum safety in a much more early stage than we addressed it in AI?

347
00:35:25,640 --> 00:35:35,080
Well, I mean, you know, I'm not confident that quantum safety, you know, really raises kind

348
00:35:35,080 --> 00:35:41,400
of novel issues, you know, that are different from those raised by classical safety, right? I mean,

349
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:46,600
you know, you want to, like, you know, I like to say, you know, a quantum computer is not exactly

350
00:35:46,600 --> 00:35:52,440
like a nuclear weapon, right? It probably won't kill anyone unless the dilution refrigerator

351
00:35:52,440 --> 00:35:58,920
tips over onto them or something like that, right? You know, I mean, I mean, certainly,

352
00:35:58,920 --> 00:36:05,080
there will be national security issues that come into play once you have scalable quantum computers

353
00:36:05,080 --> 00:36:11,960
that can break public key crypto systems, okay? And those are already being discussed,

354
00:36:11,960 --> 00:36:16,920
you know, sort of in principle, we know how to respond to those things, you know, with the

355
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:22,920
post-quantum cryptography, but, you know, it will be a struggle to get everyone to adopt that

356
00:36:22,920 --> 00:36:28,760
and to sort of agree on standards for that. You know, I mean, that's the closest that I can

357
00:36:28,760 --> 00:36:35,960
think of to a quantum safety issue, right, is just the move to post-quantum cryptography.

358
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:41,000
You know, other than that, you could say it's just, you know, a new kind of computer that will be,

359
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:49,720
you know, super fast for certain things. You know, now with AI, you know, the worry specifically is,

360
00:36:49,720 --> 00:36:55,560
you know, you give, you slightly mis-specify what its goal is, and then it's intelligent enough to

361
00:36:55,560 --> 00:37:00,680
think creatively about how to accomplish that goal, even if that means plotting against you,

362
00:37:00,680 --> 00:37:03,720
or, you know, doing something wildly different from what you intended.
