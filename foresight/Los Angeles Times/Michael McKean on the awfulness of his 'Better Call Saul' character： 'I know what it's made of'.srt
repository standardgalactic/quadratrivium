Hi, I'm Glenn Wip with the Los Angeles Times, joining us today from Better Call Saul, Michael

2
00:00:08,520 --> 00:00:09,520
McKeon.

3
00:00:09,520 --> 00:00:10,520
Welcome.

4
00:00:10,520 --> 00:00:11,520
Good afternoon.

5
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:19,120
Well, let's first start with a quote from your co-star and, I assume, friend, Bob Odenkirk,

6
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:28,160
saying, as much as I love Michael McKeon, Chuck's a ****, would you agree or disagree?

7
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:31,320
I say, write on Bob, you know?

8
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:32,320
I think Bob...

9
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:33,320
You don't take that person.

10
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:35,480
No, Bob and I are sort of agreed on it.

11
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:39,160
It's just that I know what it's made of inside there.

12
00:00:39,160 --> 00:00:51,040
I know what that level of antagonism is a very deep thing, and I know some stuff from

13
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:56,160
the writers and some stuff from the actual scripts, but you want to really examine what

14
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:59,840
makes a person the way he is or she is.

15
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:06,480
So I've done a lot of speculative stuff on there, and I have found, as we go along, that

16
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:11,200
I was pretty accurate when something comes up in the scripts where they say, well, he's

17
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:12,200
actually this.

18
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:14,960
I say, yeah, I figured that.

19
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:15,960
You know?

20
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:17,960
What's an example?

21
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:25,560
Well, his duplicity has been kind of manifest all through the series.

22
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:33,560
But the very specific pain at the center of it, which has a lot to do with one simple

23
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:44,560
fact, which is I made my mom proud, but Jimmy made her laugh, and that's like magic to me.

24
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:48,520
It's like watching someone do something that you have no...

25
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:49,800
I watched my wife knitting.

26
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:54,400
She's a big knitter, and it's like watching close-up magic to me.

27
00:01:54,400 --> 00:02:01,520
And I think that's how Chuck feels about Jimmy's ease with people.

28
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:03,360
Chuck is a very, very smart man.

29
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:05,840
He's a very, very good lawyer.

30
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:06,840
He's respected.

31
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:10,120
He's very well respected.

32
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:18,040
And deservedly so, as far as his facility with the job that he has.

33
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:22,240
But there is something missing in Chuck, and it drives him crazy.

34
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:27,800
So I had kind of figured that out very specifically about the mother, because there are some back

35
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:36,200
story that we did hear about what happened to dad, what dad's story was.

36
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:42,240
But it was nice to know that I was kind of on target about that.

37
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:43,240
And I didn't tell anybody.

38
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:47,760
I kept it to myself, and I said, well, this is something I can play.

39
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:51,960
And then it turned out that there really was a pivotal moment there.
