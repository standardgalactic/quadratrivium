0	8520	Hi, I'm Glenn Wip with the Los Angeles Times, joining us today from Better Call Saul, Michael
8520	9520	McKeon.
9520	10520	Welcome.
10520	11520	Good afternoon.
11520	19120	Well, let's first start with a quote from your co-star and, I assume, friend, Bob Odenkirk,
19120	28160	saying, as much as I love Michael McKeon, Chuck's a ****, would you agree or disagree?
28160	31320	I say, write on Bob, you know?
31320	32320	I think Bob...
32320	33320	You don't take that person.
33320	35480	No, Bob and I are sort of agreed on it.
35480	39160	It's just that I know what it's made of inside there.
39160	51040	I know what that level of antagonism is a very deep thing, and I know some stuff from
51040	56160	the writers and some stuff from the actual scripts, but you want to really examine what
56160	59840	makes a person the way he is or she is.
59840	66480	So I've done a lot of speculative stuff on there, and I have found, as we go along, that
66480	71200	I was pretty accurate when something comes up in the scripts where they say, well, he's
71200	72200	actually this.
72200	74960	I say, yeah, I figured that.
74960	75960	You know?
75960	77960	What's an example?
77960	85560	Well, his duplicity has been kind of manifest all through the series.
85560	93560	But the very specific pain at the center of it, which has a lot to do with one simple
93560	104560	fact, which is I made my mom proud, but Jimmy made her laugh, and that's like magic to me.
104560	108520	It's like watching someone do something that you have no...
108520	109800	I watched my wife knitting.
109800	114400	She's a big knitter, and it's like watching close-up magic to me.
114400	121520	And I think that's how Chuck feels about Jimmy's ease with people.
121520	123360	Chuck is a very, very smart man.
123360	125840	He's a very, very good lawyer.
125840	126840	He's respected.
126840	130120	He's very well respected.
130120	138040	And deservedly so, as far as his facility with the job that he has.
138040	142240	But there is something missing in Chuck, and it drives him crazy.
142240	147800	So I had kind of figured that out very specifically about the mother, because there are some back
147800	156200	story that we did hear about what happened to dad, what dad's story was.
156200	162240	But it was nice to know that I was kind of on target about that.
162240	163240	And I didn't tell anybody.
163240	167760	I kept it to myself, and I said, well, this is something I can play.
167760	171960	And then it turned out that there really was a pivotal moment there.
