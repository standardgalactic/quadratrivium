Checking Los Angeles Times/Michael McKean on the awfulness of his 'Better Call Saul' characterï¼š 'I know what it's made of'.txt
 Glenn Wip from the Los Angeles Times is interviewing Michael McKean, who plays Charles "Chuck" McGill in the television series "Better Call Saul," a prequel to "Breaking Bad." During the interview, McKean discusses his character Chuck, particularly in response to a quote from his co-star Bob Odenkirk (who plays Jimmy McGill/Saul Goodman) who referred to Chuck as a "****."

McKean agrees with Odenkirk to an extent but adds that his portrayal of Chuck is informed by understanding the character's complex motivations. He mentions that he has done a lot of speculative work on the character, which has proven accurate as the series progressed. McKean explains that Chuck's antagonism towards Jimmy stems from deep-seated issues, including a sense of competition and jealousy, particularly around their mother's approval.

Chuck, although highly intelligent and successful in his career, feels a lack in his life that Jimmy fills with his ability to make people laugh and be at ease, something Chuck himself cannot do. McKean notes that Chuck is envious of Jimmy's ease with people, which he likens to watching close-up magic. McKean also points out that while there are hints of Chuck's backstory and motivations in the scripts and conversations with the writers, he has done additional work on his own to understand and portray the character's complexities.

McKean emphasizes that Chuck is a brilliant and respected lawyer but that there is something fundamentally missing in his life, which drives him to distraction. He also notes that some of the specific motivations and pivotal moments he had speculated about were later confirmed by developments in the series.
