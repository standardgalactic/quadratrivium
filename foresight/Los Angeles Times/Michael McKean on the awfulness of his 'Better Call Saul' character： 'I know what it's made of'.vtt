Hi, I'm Glenn Wip with the Los Angeles Times, joining us today from Better Call Saul, Michael

00:08.520 --> 00:09.520
McKeon.

00:09.520 --> 00:10.520
Welcome.

00:10.520 --> 00:11.520
Good afternoon.

00:11.520 --> 00:19.120
Well, let's first start with a quote from your co-star and, I assume, friend, Bob Odenkirk,

00:19.120 --> 00:28.160
saying, as much as I love Michael McKeon, Chuck's a ****, would you agree or disagree?

00:28.160 --> 00:31.320
I say, write on Bob, you know?

00:31.320 --> 00:32.320
I think Bob...

00:32.320 --> 00:33.320
You don't take that person.

00:33.320 --> 00:35.480
No, Bob and I are sort of agreed on it.

00:35.480 --> 00:39.160
It's just that I know what it's made of inside there.

00:39.160 --> 00:51.040
I know what that level of antagonism is a very deep thing, and I know some stuff from

00:51.040 --> 00:56.160
the writers and some stuff from the actual scripts, but you want to really examine what

00:56.160 --> 00:59.840
makes a person the way he is or she is.

00:59.840 --> 01:06.480
So I've done a lot of speculative stuff on there, and I have found, as we go along, that

01:06.480 --> 01:11.200
I was pretty accurate when something comes up in the scripts where they say, well, he's

01:11.200 --> 01:12.200
actually this.

01:12.200 --> 01:14.960
I say, yeah, I figured that.

01:14.960 --> 01:15.960
You know?

01:15.960 --> 01:17.960
What's an example?

01:17.960 --> 01:25.560
Well, his duplicity has been kind of manifest all through the series.

01:25.560 --> 01:33.560
But the very specific pain at the center of it, which has a lot to do with one simple

01:33.560 --> 01:44.560
fact, which is I made my mom proud, but Jimmy made her laugh, and that's like magic to me.

01:44.560 --> 01:48.520
It's like watching someone do something that you have no...

01:48.520 --> 01:49.800
I watched my wife knitting.

01:49.800 --> 01:54.400
She's a big knitter, and it's like watching close-up magic to me.

01:54.400 --> 02:01.520
And I think that's how Chuck feels about Jimmy's ease with people.

02:01.520 --> 02:03.360
Chuck is a very, very smart man.

02:03.360 --> 02:05.840
He's a very, very good lawyer.

02:05.840 --> 02:06.840
He's respected.

02:06.840 --> 02:10.120
He's very well respected.

02:10.120 --> 02:18.040
And deservedly so, as far as his facility with the job that he has.

02:18.040 --> 02:22.240
But there is something missing in Chuck, and it drives him crazy.

02:22.240 --> 02:27.800
So I had kind of figured that out very specifically about the mother, because there are some back

02:27.800 --> 02:36.200
story that we did hear about what happened to dad, what dad's story was.

02:36.200 --> 02:42.240
But it was nice to know that I was kind of on target about that.

02:42.240 --> 02:43.240
And I didn't tell anybody.

02:43.240 --> 02:47.760
I kept it to myself, and I said, well, this is something I can play.

02:47.760 --> 02:51.960
And then it turned out that there really was a pivotal moment there.
