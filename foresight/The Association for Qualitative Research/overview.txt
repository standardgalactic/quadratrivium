Checking The Association for Qualitative Research/‘THE MIND IS FLAT’ - Is mental depth and the unconscious just an illusion？.txt
 Nick Owen and Luke Doolan engaged in an insightful discussion about Nick's book, "The Improvised Mind," during a webinar hosted by Luella Chow for the Association for Qualitative Research (AQR). Here are some key points from their conversation:

1. **Improvised Mindset**: Nick emphasized that the mind is not a machine that follows fixed paths but rather operates like an improviser, constantly creating new associations and responses based on the context at hand.

2. **Unconscious Bias and Implicit Association Tests (IATs)**: While acknowledging the utility of IATs in measuring unconscious biases, Nick pointed out that these tests may not be as direct a window into the unconscious as they are sometimes thought to be. Our minds are always improvising, and we're never fully conscious of the processes underlying our responses.

3. **Therapy as Co-Creation**: In therapy, the process is often one of co-creation between therapist and client, where they work together to find new interpretations and constructive narratives that can aid in personal growth and development.

4. **Paper Submissions and Upcoming Events**: Luella reminded the audience of the approaching deadline for paper submissions to "AQR's Big Day Out" and mentioned other upcoming events, including tickets for a QR event and breakfast bites, as well as details for a future event on transforming imposter syndrome.

The discussion highlighted the complexities of human psychology and the importance of considering the improvisational nature of our thoughts and behaviors in both therapeutic and research contexts. The webinar concluded with a reminder to stay tuned for more information about upcoming AQR events.
