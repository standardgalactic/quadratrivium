Checking The Histocrat/Gilgamesh and the Flood.txt
The epic of Gilgamesh is one of the oldest pieces of literature known to humanity, originating from ancient Mesopotamia around the late third or early second millennium BCE. The story of Gilgamesh, a legendary king of Uruk, and his quest for immortality, along with his companion Enkidu, has captivated audiences for thousands of years. After its initial creation, the epic was preserved in cuneiform on clay tablets, but it was lost to the world for over two millennia following the fall of the Neo-Assyrian Empire.

The modern rediscovery of the Gilgamesh epic began in the 19th century with the discovery of its tablet fragments by Hormuzd Rassam and others, with the most complete version being translated into English by Stephen Langdon in 1928. The epic gained wider recognition in the 20th century through the efforts of scholars and translators, as well as adaptations like Douglas Jeffrey Bridson's radio play "The Quest of Gilgamesh."

In the latter half of the 20th century, Gilgamesh's story began to appear in various forms of popular culture, influencing literature, film, and other art forms. The epic's themes of friendship, mortality, and the human condition resonated with audiences and inspired numerous adaptations and interpretations.

Today, while the original Sumerian civilization has long since vanished, Gilgamesh is a familiar figure to many in Western culture, often recognized as a character or symbol, independent of his epic origins. His story continues to be retold and reimagined in modern media, proving that despite being rooted in an ancient past, its themes remain relevant to contemporary society.
