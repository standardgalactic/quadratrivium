1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Now let's start our drawing by putting a line across the bottom part of the picture like this, about a fourth of the way up.

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:16,000
And then let's draw another one that sort of curves and dips down here, and another one here, so that we create some foothills.

3
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:23,000
And a mountain back here. You know, this is going to be a scene of one of my favorite spots, Palm Springs, California,

4
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:29,000
where the snow-capped mountains meet the palm trees and the grapefruit roads.

5
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Now let's put in a little tone up here in the sky. Place your pencil on its side.

6
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Or if you have a crayon, use a broad side so that you can cover a lot of area with a few strokes.

7
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Lay it in rather lightly. We don't want our sky to come too dark.

8
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:51,000
However, we're going to get a snow-capped peak there, so we do need little depth to this.

9
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:58,000
After you've covered most of it, you can smoothly blend it by using a piece of cleansing tissue.

10
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Show you how that's done. You just bunch it up like this, and then you work it back and forth,

11
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:10,000
and work it in various directions until you get the background smoothed out.

12
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:17,000
That's the idea. Of course, if you want to put in a cloud effect, well, you can add some more tone to it later.

13
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:25,000
And now let's get that snow-capped to the mountain. Let's bring it down here sort of irregularly, like that.

14
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:34,000
And bring some tone down this slope, because that mountain is basically a cone form.

15
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:39,000
We'll have our light come in from the upper right, so you'd shade down the left side like that.

16
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Bring your tone right down close to the top of this foothill.

17
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Now let's get a crevice in this mountain, sort of a big canyon. Make another one go out this way.

18
00:01:50,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Use your crayon on its side like that so you sort of craze it and break it up into sort of triangular shapes.

19
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:08,000
A little bit later, we'll put in a few accents in those canyons to indicate more roughness.

20
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Of course, here and there you can blend across in order to give a little more substance and tone,

21
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:20,000
so that the lower part of the mountain doesn't appear to be as white and snow-capped like the top.

22
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Yes, you might even bring a little tone down the edge of this snow-cap and a little down there.

23
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Now within the crevices of these canyons, put in some still darker accents here and there.

24
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:38,000
And let's darken this slope even more.

25
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Bring all of this tone down close to the surface of that foothill also.

26
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:52,000
This Coachella Valley, where we have Palm Springs, is one of the most interesting and one of the newest developments of nature.

27
00:02:52,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Actually, up until about 300 years ago, this was undersea and the land slowly rose.

28
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:08,000
And there are many records there of sea life that lasted right up to the past 300 years.

29
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Of course, now it's a verdant valley irrigated by the great Colorado River.

30
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Now let's indicate some buildings back in here.

31
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:24,000
You don't need to actually draw a building, but suggest shaded sides of buildings.

32
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,000
There's modern and Spanish architecture combined there.

33
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:33,000
And in the brilliant sunlight, about all you see is glistening white and then the shadows.

34
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Well, here in the foreground, we can make an interesting driveway by making a curved stroke come around like that.

35
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:46,000
And starting at that point, let's bring another one around here.

36
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Now let's give a little thickness to that surface so that it looks as though those are curved.

37
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:56,000
There's some beautiful curved drives around there in Palm Springs.

38
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Now for some tone on this top surface here.

39
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Make those strokes lie down horizontally like this.

40
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Just stroke them in, lying flat like that.

41
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Yes, in this valley, you'll find not only date palms, but grapefruit, lemon,

42
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
and a beautiful bougainville.

43
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,000
It's a brilliant deep red flower.

44
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Hunting birds fly around there all the time too.

45
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Now let's see what we can do here next.

46
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:39,000
I think perhaps we ought to give a little irregularity and texture to this foothill.

47
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,000
And let's do a little to this one back here also.

48
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Just to show a little separation between this upper hill and the lower one.

49
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Well, now let's see what we can do here.

50
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Let's make this curve stand up by shading the side of it.

51
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Since light's coming in from the right, that would get shaded.

52
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Now let's put in a grapefruit grove here.

53
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Draw a circle and another circle and another one overlapping.

54
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:15,000
And bring down the trunk of each tree like that.

55
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
You didn't know they were round like grapefruit, did you?

56
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Well, they're not exactly round, but they are sort of round like that.

57
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Now you put in some shading on the left side of each of these ball forms.

58
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Make it crescent shape.

59
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Those leaves are very deep green.

60
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:36,000
There you rough up the smoothness of the circle.

61
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:44,000
And let's indicate some fruit on these trees and then we'll fill in between.

62
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Just work some tone in and around between those circular shapes that you've made.

63
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:55,000
And we'll soon be harvesting that trunk.

64
00:05:55,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Well, put a little tone on the trunks of these trees and let's indicate more trees in behind there.

65
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Now cast some shadows from the bases of these trees.

66
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:17,000
And because of the solid grouping of the tops of them, this massive here on this surface.

67
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Always keeping it lying down.

68
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Let it drop down from this curb and reach partly out into the highway here.

69
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Well, maybe I've grown a little fast for you here, but anytime I do that you put down whatever you can during the program

70
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:41,000
and then finish up later because you'll find that when you're drawing the picture over and taking your time,

71
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:44,000
that you really do a much better picture.

72
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Well, while you're catching up there, I'd like to show you something that's going to help you make better drawings.

73
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Alright.

74
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Well, now let's get back to our drawing here.

75
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Since we're drawing a picture of palms, friends, I guess you wonder where the palms are.

76
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Well, we'll draw one right here like that.

77
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Now let's put some fronds on the top of this palm tree.

78
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Make them shoot out sort of like a fountain or a fireworks or those poorly gigs.

79
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:24,000
After you've put the main stems on, put a whole series of these little leaves and then make them cross like that.

80
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Shoot some in on each one until you've got a whole lacework of long needles.

81
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:47,000
You know, these palms are very interesting because each year these live fronds die and hang down forming a large heavy skirt around the trunk.

82
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Of course, you know, that holds a great deal of water through the dry season.

83
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Let's get a little highlight on this side here.

84
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:02,000
It keeps the tree alive through the hottest, driest weather.

85
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Now let's see what we can do here.

86
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Well, I think we ought to cast a shadow.

87
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Cast a long shadow going out to the left.

88
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,000
And by the way, we put some buildings in here while I go.

89
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Let's cast some little thin shadows to the left of those.

90
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
We'll hang down like that.

91
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,000
And in the back, let's put in several more palms.

92
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Those you merely suggest.

93
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Oh, there are lots of them there, all right.

94
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Royal palms and Washington palms.

95
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Say, by the way, that mountain up there in the background, there's something interesting about it I'd like to tell you.

96
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Around on the other side, now this is San Jacinto.

97
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Around on the other side near the top, there's a creek called Snow Creek,

98
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:47,000
in which the snow never melts the year round.

99
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Now let's put another huge palm right here at the side.

100
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Let's sort of break it into the edge of the picture to frame.

101
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Come right on out like that.

102
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:03,000
And then bring those prongs down like this.

103
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Put a few touches of texture here on the trunk.

104
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:11,000
And shoot some of these huge prongs out like this.

105
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Speaking about that Snow Creek up there, it never reaches the desert floor.

106
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,000
It sort of disappears, but it flows the year round.

107
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
There are trout up there.

108
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Marine life that you won't find anywhere else in the world.

109
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:31,000
The stream flows constantly from the melted snow.

110
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Well, let's see now what else we could do here in this picture.

111
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Let's cast a shadow across the foreground.

112
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
That helps frame it too.

113
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:42,000
In like this, right across there.

114
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Now let's put our frame on the picture.

115
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:50,000
You can see by learning to draw, the artist's imagination is free

116
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,000
to create pictures from many parts of the world at any time.

117
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
And by the way, here's something I'd like to show you

118
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:58,000
that'll help you create pictures like this.
