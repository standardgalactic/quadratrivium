1. **Setting Up the Scene**: Begin by sketching a few palm trees with rounded grapefruit-like circles for their crowns. Indicate deep green leaves and suggest some fruit on the trees. Fill in between the tree forms with tone to create depth and volume.

2. **Trunks and Shadows**: Add texture to the trunks of the palms, indicating their roughness. Introduce more trees behind the initial ones and cast shadows from the bases of the trees onto the ground and each other.

3. **Palm Fronds**: Draw the fronds of a palm tree, resembling a fountain or fireworks, crossing over each other to form a lacework of long needles. Highlight the side of the tree to show light reflecting off its surface.

4. **Palm Details**: Add details such as the heavy skirt around the trunk that holds water during the dry season. Cast a long shadow for the palm trees going out to the left and add buildings in the background with thin shadows.

5. **Background Elements**: Frame the scene with another large palm tree on the side, breaking into the edge of the picture. Add texture to the trunk and shoot out huge prongs from the crown. Mention the unique feature of Snow Creek up in the mountains, which never melts and harbors trout not found anywhere else in the world.

6. **Finishing Touches**: Cast a shadow across the foreground, frame the picture with a border, and remind viewers that learning to draw opens up the artist's imagination to create scenes from all over the world.

7. **Additional Tips**: Throughout the process, it's suggested to work at your own pace during the program and finish up later for a more refined drawing. Also, the importance of framing, lighting, and shadows is emphasized to give depth and context to the scene.

8. **Educational Insight**: The presenter explains that by understanding the environment and features of a location, such as San Jacinto with Snow Creek, an artist can add authenticity and interest to their drawings.

9. **Cultural Enrichment**: The drawing lesson is used as an opportunity to share knowledge about natural wonders, like Snow Creek's perpetual snow and its unique ecosystem, which enriches the viewer's understanding of the subject matter beyond just the technical aspects of drawing.
