0	8000	Now let's start our drawing by putting a line across the bottom part of the picture like this, about a fourth of the way up.
8000	16000	And then let's draw another one that sort of curves and dips down here, and another one here, so that we create some foothills.
16000	23000	And a mountain back here. You know, this is going to be a scene of one of my favorite spots, Palm Springs, California,
23000	29000	where the snow-capped mountains meet the palm trees and the grapefruit roads.
29000	34000	Now let's put in a little tone up here in the sky. Place your pencil on its side.
34000	40000	Or if you have a crayon, use a broad side so that you can cover a lot of area with a few strokes.
40000	45000	Lay it in rather lightly. We don't want our sky to come too dark.
45000	51000	However, we're going to get a snow-capped peak there, so we do need little depth to this.
51000	58000	After you've covered most of it, you can smoothly blend it by using a piece of cleansing tissue.
58000	64000	Show you how that's done. You just bunch it up like this, and then you work it back and forth,
64000	70000	and work it in various directions until you get the background smoothed out.
70000	77000	That's the idea. Of course, if you want to put in a cloud effect, well, you can add some more tone to it later.
77000	85000	And now let's get that snow-capped to the mountain. Let's bring it down here sort of irregularly, like that.
85000	94000	And bring some tone down this slope, because that mountain is basically a cone form.
94000	99000	We'll have our light come in from the upper right, so you'd shade down the left side like that.
99000	103000	Bring your tone right down close to the top of this foothill.
103000	110000	Now let's get a crevice in this mountain, sort of a big canyon. Make another one go out this way.
110000	121000	Use your crayon on its side like that so you sort of craze it and break it up into sort of triangular shapes.
121000	128000	A little bit later, we'll put in a few accents in those canyons to indicate more roughness.
128000	133000	Of course, here and there you can blend across in order to give a little more substance and tone,
133000	140000	so that the lower part of the mountain doesn't appear to be as white and snow-capped like the top.
140000	146000	Yes, you might even bring a little tone down the edge of this snow-cap and a little down there.
146000	153000	Now within the crevices of these canyons, put in some still darker accents here and there.
153000	158000	And let's darken this slope even more.
158000	163000	Bring all of this tone down close to the surface of that foothill also.
163000	172000	This Coachella Valley, where we have Palm Springs, is one of the most interesting and one of the newest developments of nature.
172000	181000	Actually, up until about 300 years ago, this was undersea and the land slowly rose.
181000	188000	And there are many records there of sea life that lasted right up to the past 300 years.
188000	193000	Of course, now it's a verdant valley irrigated by the great Colorado River.
193000	198000	Now let's indicate some buildings back in here.
198000	204000	You don't need to actually draw a building, but suggest shaded sides of buildings.
204000	207000	There's modern and Spanish architecture combined there.
207000	213000	And in the brilliant sunlight, about all you see is glistening white and then the shadows.
213000	221000	Well, here in the foreground, we can make an interesting driveway by making a curved stroke come around like that.
221000	226000	And starting at that point, let's bring another one around here.
226000	232000	Now let's give a little thickness to that surface so that it looks as though those are curved.
232000	236000	There's some beautiful curved drives around there in Palm Springs.
236000	239000	Now for some tone on this top surface here.
239000	245000	Make those strokes lie down horizontally like this.
245000	251000	Just stroke them in, lying flat like that.
251000	260000	Yes, in this valley, you'll find not only date palms, but grapefruit, lemon,
260000	262000	and a beautiful bougainville.
262000	265000	It's a brilliant deep red flower.
265000	269000	Hunting birds fly around there all the time too.
269000	272000	Now let's see what we can do here next.
272000	279000	I think perhaps we ought to give a little irregularity and texture to this foothill.
279000	282000	And let's do a little to this one back here also.
282000	289000	Just to show a little separation between this upper hill and the lower one.
290000	292000	Well, now let's see what we can do here.
292000	296000	Let's make this curve stand up by shading the side of it.
296000	300000	Since light's coming in from the right, that would get shaded.
300000	304000	Now let's put in a grapefruit grove here.
304000	310000	Draw a circle and another circle and another one overlapping.
310000	315000	And bring down the trunk of each tree like that.
315000	317000	You didn't know they were round like grapefruit, did you?
317000	322000	Well, they're not exactly round, but they are sort of round like that.
322000	326000	Now you put in some shading on the left side of each of these ball forms.
326000	328000	Make it crescent shape.
328000	332000	Those leaves are very deep green.
332000	336000	There you rough up the smoothness of the circle.
336000	344000	And let's indicate some fruit on these trees and then we'll fill in between.
344000	351000	Just work some tone in and around between those circular shapes that you've made.
351000	355000	And we'll soon be harvesting that trunk.
355000	364000	Well, put a little tone on the trunks of these trees and let's indicate more trees in behind there.
364000	369000	Now cast some shadows from the bases of these trees.
369000	377000	And because of the solid grouping of the tops of them, this massive here on this surface.
377000	379000	Always keeping it lying down.
379000	386000	Let it drop down from this curb and reach partly out into the highway here.
386000	394000	Well, maybe I've grown a little fast for you here, but anytime I do that you put down whatever you can during the program
394000	401000	and then finish up later because you'll find that when you're drawing the picture over and taking your time,
401000	404000	that you really do a much better picture.
404000	410000	Well, while you're catching up there, I'd like to show you something that's going to help you make better drawings.
410000	416000	Alright.
416000	418000	Well, now let's get back to our drawing here.
418000	422000	Since we're drawing a picture of palms, friends, I guess you wonder where the palms are.
422000	425000	Well, we'll draw one right here like that.
425000	429000	Now let's put some fronds on the top of this palm tree.
429000	435000	Make them shoot out sort of like a fountain or a fireworks or those poorly gigs.
435000	444000	After you've put the main stems on, put a whole series of these little leaves and then make them cross like that.
444000	452000	Shoot some in on each one until you've got a whole lacework of long needles.
452000	467000	You know, these palms are very interesting because each year these live fronds die and hang down forming a large heavy skirt around the trunk.
467000	473000	Of course, you know, that holds a great deal of water through the dry season.
473000	476000	Let's get a little highlight on this side here.
476000	482000	It keeps the tree alive through the hottest, driest weather.
482000	484000	Now let's see what we can do here.
484000	486000	Well, I think we ought to cast a shadow.
486000	489000	Cast a long shadow going out to the left.
489000	492000	And by the way, we put some buildings in here while I go.
492000	496000	Let's cast some little thin shadows to the left of those.
496000	498000	We'll hang down like that.
498000	501000	And in the back, let's put in several more palms.
501000	503000	Those you merely suggest.
503000	506000	Oh, there are lots of them there, all right.
506000	510000	Royal palms and Washington palms.
510000	515000	Say, by the way, that mountain up there in the background, there's something interesting about it I'd like to tell you.
515000	518000	Around on the other side, now this is San Jacinto.
518000	523000	Around on the other side near the top, there's a creek called Snow Creek,
523000	527000	in which the snow never melts the year round.
527000	531000	Now let's put another huge palm right here at the side.
531000	535000	Let's sort of break it into the edge of the picture to frame.
535000	537000	Come right on out like that.
537000	543000	And then bring those prongs down like this.
543000	547000	Put a few touches of texture here on the trunk.
547000	551000	And shoot some of these huge prongs out like this.
551000	556000	Speaking about that Snow Creek up there, it never reaches the desert floor.
556000	559000	It sort of disappears, but it flows the year round.
559000	561000	There are trout up there.
561000	566000	Marine life that you won't find anywhere else in the world.
566000	571000	The stream flows constantly from the melted snow.
571000	574000	Well, let's see now what else we could do here in this picture.
574000	576000	Let's cast a shadow across the foreground.
576000	578000	That helps frame it too.
578000	582000	In like this, right across there.
582000	585000	Now let's put our frame on the picture.
585000	590000	You can see by learning to draw, the artist's imagination is free
590000	593000	to create pictures from many parts of the world at any time.
593000	595000	And by the way, here's something I'd like to show you
595000	598000	that'll help you create pictures like this.
