00:00.000 --> 00:08.000
Now let's start our drawing by putting a line across the bottom part of the picture like this, about a fourth of the way up.

00:08.000 --> 00:16.000
And then let's draw another one that sort of curves and dips down here, and another one here, so that we create some foothills.

00:16.000 --> 00:23.000
And a mountain back here. You know, this is going to be a scene of one of my favorite spots, Palm Springs, California,

00:23.000 --> 00:29.000
where the snow-capped mountains meet the palm trees and the grapefruit roads.

00:29.000 --> 00:34.000
Now let's put in a little tone up here in the sky. Place your pencil on its side.

00:34.000 --> 00:40.000
Or if you have a crayon, use a broad side so that you can cover a lot of area with a few strokes.

00:40.000 --> 00:45.000
Lay it in rather lightly. We don't want our sky to come too dark.

00:45.000 --> 00:51.000
However, we're going to get a snow-capped peak there, so we do need little depth to this.

00:51.000 --> 00:58.000
After you've covered most of it, you can smoothly blend it by using a piece of cleansing tissue.

00:58.000 --> 01:04.000
Show you how that's done. You just bunch it up like this, and then you work it back and forth,

01:04.000 --> 01:10.000
and work it in various directions until you get the background smoothed out.

01:10.000 --> 01:17.000
That's the idea. Of course, if you want to put in a cloud effect, well, you can add some more tone to it later.

01:17.000 --> 01:25.000
And now let's get that snow-capped to the mountain. Let's bring it down here sort of irregularly, like that.

01:25.000 --> 01:34.000
And bring some tone down this slope, because that mountain is basically a cone form.

01:34.000 --> 01:39.000
We'll have our light come in from the upper right, so you'd shade down the left side like that.

01:39.000 --> 01:43.000
Bring your tone right down close to the top of this foothill.

01:43.000 --> 01:50.000
Now let's get a crevice in this mountain, sort of a big canyon. Make another one go out this way.

01:50.000 --> 02:01.000
Use your crayon on its side like that so you sort of craze it and break it up into sort of triangular shapes.

02:01.000 --> 02:08.000
A little bit later, we'll put in a few accents in those canyons to indicate more roughness.

02:08.000 --> 02:13.000
Of course, here and there you can blend across in order to give a little more substance and tone,

02:13.000 --> 02:20.000
so that the lower part of the mountain doesn't appear to be as white and snow-capped like the top.

02:20.000 --> 02:26.000
Yes, you might even bring a little tone down the edge of this snow-cap and a little down there.

02:26.000 --> 02:33.000
Now within the crevices of these canyons, put in some still darker accents here and there.

02:33.000 --> 02:38.000
And let's darken this slope even more.

02:38.000 --> 02:43.000
Bring all of this tone down close to the surface of that foothill also.

02:43.000 --> 02:52.000
This Coachella Valley, where we have Palm Springs, is one of the most interesting and one of the newest developments of nature.

02:52.000 --> 03:01.000
Actually, up until about 300 years ago, this was undersea and the land slowly rose.

03:01.000 --> 03:08.000
And there are many records there of sea life that lasted right up to the past 300 years.

03:08.000 --> 03:13.000
Of course, now it's a verdant valley irrigated by the great Colorado River.

03:13.000 --> 03:18.000
Now let's indicate some buildings back in here.

03:18.000 --> 03:24.000
You don't need to actually draw a building, but suggest shaded sides of buildings.

03:24.000 --> 03:27.000
There's modern and Spanish architecture combined there.

03:27.000 --> 03:33.000
And in the brilliant sunlight, about all you see is glistening white and then the shadows.

03:33.000 --> 03:41.000
Well, here in the foreground, we can make an interesting driveway by making a curved stroke come around like that.

03:41.000 --> 03:46.000
And starting at that point, let's bring another one around here.

03:46.000 --> 03:52.000
Now let's give a little thickness to that surface so that it looks as though those are curved.

03:52.000 --> 03:56.000
There's some beautiful curved drives around there in Palm Springs.

03:56.000 --> 03:59.000
Now for some tone on this top surface here.

03:59.000 --> 04:05.000
Make those strokes lie down horizontally like this.

04:05.000 --> 04:11.000
Just stroke them in, lying flat like that.

04:11.000 --> 04:20.000
Yes, in this valley, you'll find not only date palms, but grapefruit, lemon,

04:20.000 --> 04:22.000
and a beautiful bougainville.

04:22.000 --> 04:25.000
It's a brilliant deep red flower.

04:25.000 --> 04:29.000
Hunting birds fly around there all the time too.

04:29.000 --> 04:32.000
Now let's see what we can do here next.

04:32.000 --> 04:39.000
I think perhaps we ought to give a little irregularity and texture to this foothill.

04:39.000 --> 04:42.000
And let's do a little to this one back here also.

04:42.000 --> 04:49.000
Just to show a little separation between this upper hill and the lower one.

04:50.000 --> 04:52.000
Well, now let's see what we can do here.

04:52.000 --> 04:56.000
Let's make this curve stand up by shading the side of it.

04:56.000 --> 05:00.000
Since light's coming in from the right, that would get shaded.

05:00.000 --> 05:04.000
Now let's put in a grapefruit grove here.

05:04.000 --> 05:10.000
Draw a circle and another circle and another one overlapping.

05:10.000 --> 05:15.000
And bring down the trunk of each tree like that.

05:15.000 --> 05:17.000
You didn't know they were round like grapefruit, did you?

05:17.000 --> 05:22.000
Well, they're not exactly round, but they are sort of round like that.

05:22.000 --> 05:26.000
Now you put in some shading on the left side of each of these ball forms.

05:26.000 --> 05:28.000
Make it crescent shape.

05:28.000 --> 05:32.000
Those leaves are very deep green.

05:32.000 --> 05:36.000
There you rough up the smoothness of the circle.

05:36.000 --> 05:44.000
And let's indicate some fruit on these trees and then we'll fill in between.

05:44.000 --> 05:51.000
Just work some tone in and around between those circular shapes that you've made.

05:51.000 --> 05:55.000
And we'll soon be harvesting that trunk.

05:55.000 --> 06:04.000
Well, put a little tone on the trunks of these trees and let's indicate more trees in behind there.

06:04.000 --> 06:09.000
Now cast some shadows from the bases of these trees.

06:09.000 --> 06:17.000
And because of the solid grouping of the tops of them, this massive here on this surface.

06:17.000 --> 06:19.000
Always keeping it lying down.

06:19.000 --> 06:26.000
Let it drop down from this curb and reach partly out into the highway here.

06:26.000 --> 06:34.000
Well, maybe I've grown a little fast for you here, but anytime I do that you put down whatever you can during the program

06:34.000 --> 06:41.000
and then finish up later because you'll find that when you're drawing the picture over and taking your time,

06:41.000 --> 06:44.000
that you really do a much better picture.

06:44.000 --> 06:50.000
Well, while you're catching up there, I'd like to show you something that's going to help you make better drawings.

06:50.000 --> 06:56.000
Alright.

06:56.000 --> 06:58.000
Well, now let's get back to our drawing here.

06:58.000 --> 07:02.000
Since we're drawing a picture of palms, friends, I guess you wonder where the palms are.

07:02.000 --> 07:05.000
Well, we'll draw one right here like that.

07:05.000 --> 07:09.000
Now let's put some fronds on the top of this palm tree.

07:09.000 --> 07:15.000
Make them shoot out sort of like a fountain or a fireworks or those poorly gigs.

07:15.000 --> 07:24.000
After you've put the main stems on, put a whole series of these little leaves and then make them cross like that.

07:24.000 --> 07:32.000
Shoot some in on each one until you've got a whole lacework of long needles.

07:32.000 --> 07:47.000
You know, these palms are very interesting because each year these live fronds die and hang down forming a large heavy skirt around the trunk.

07:47.000 --> 07:53.000
Of course, you know, that holds a great deal of water through the dry season.

07:53.000 --> 07:56.000
Let's get a little highlight on this side here.

07:56.000 --> 08:02.000
It keeps the tree alive through the hottest, driest weather.

08:02.000 --> 08:04.000
Now let's see what we can do here.

08:04.000 --> 08:06.000
Well, I think we ought to cast a shadow.

08:06.000 --> 08:09.000
Cast a long shadow going out to the left.

08:09.000 --> 08:12.000
And by the way, we put some buildings in here while I go.

08:12.000 --> 08:16.000
Let's cast some little thin shadows to the left of those.

08:16.000 --> 08:18.000
We'll hang down like that.

08:18.000 --> 08:21.000
And in the back, let's put in several more palms.

08:21.000 --> 08:23.000
Those you merely suggest.

08:23.000 --> 08:26.000
Oh, there are lots of them there, all right.

08:26.000 --> 08:30.000
Royal palms and Washington palms.

08:30.000 --> 08:35.000
Say, by the way, that mountain up there in the background, there's something interesting about it I'd like to tell you.

08:35.000 --> 08:38.000
Around on the other side, now this is San Jacinto.

08:38.000 --> 08:43.000
Around on the other side near the top, there's a creek called Snow Creek,

08:43.000 --> 08:47.000
in which the snow never melts the year round.

08:47.000 --> 08:51.000
Now let's put another huge palm right here at the side.

08:51.000 --> 08:55.000
Let's sort of break it into the edge of the picture to frame.

08:55.000 --> 08:57.000
Come right on out like that.

08:57.000 --> 09:03.000
And then bring those prongs down like this.

09:03.000 --> 09:07.000
Put a few touches of texture here on the trunk.

09:07.000 --> 09:11.000
And shoot some of these huge prongs out like this.

09:11.000 --> 09:16.000
Speaking about that Snow Creek up there, it never reaches the desert floor.

09:16.000 --> 09:19.000
It sort of disappears, but it flows the year round.

09:19.000 --> 09:21.000
There are trout up there.

09:21.000 --> 09:26.000
Marine life that you won't find anywhere else in the world.

09:26.000 --> 09:31.000
The stream flows constantly from the melted snow.

09:31.000 --> 09:34.000
Well, let's see now what else we could do here in this picture.

09:34.000 --> 09:36.000
Let's cast a shadow across the foreground.

09:36.000 --> 09:38.000
That helps frame it too.

09:38.000 --> 09:42.000
In like this, right across there.

09:42.000 --> 09:45.000
Now let's put our frame on the picture.

09:45.000 --> 09:50.000
You can see by learning to draw, the artist's imagination is free

09:50.000 --> 09:53.000
to create pictures from many parts of the world at any time.

09:53.000 --> 09:55.000
And by the way, here's something I'd like to show you

09:55.000 --> 09:58.000
that'll help you create pictures like this.
