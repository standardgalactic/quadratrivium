Checking Planet： Critical/Reimagining A.I. ｜ John Wild.txt
 In this episode of Planet Critical, host John Jordan explores the concept of technology as a force that can either perpetuate competition and destruction or foster symbiotic relationships akin to Mycelium networks. The discussion delves into the social constructs of individualism versus entanglement and how these perspectives shape our understanding of society and our interaction with technology.

John introduces the idea of Mycelium as an exemplar for rethinking both biology and social structures, emphasizing the interconnectedness of all life forms and the importance of relationships in reinforcing reality positively. He suggests that if we view ourselves and our interactions as entangled threads, we could potentially weave a more resilient and sustainable social fabric.

The episode concludes with John nominating Jay Jordan, an art activist known for his involvement with movements like Reclaim the Streets and the Laboratory of Insurrectionary Imagination, as someone to platform. Jay's work embodies direct action and resistance in the pursuit of socio-ecological transformation, making him a fitting choice to take the imaginaries discussed forward into real-world activism.
