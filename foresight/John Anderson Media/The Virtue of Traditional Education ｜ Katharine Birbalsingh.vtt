00:00.000 --> 00:06.400
They need to hear that sense of purpose and drive, and that when you're knocked down,

00:06.400 --> 00:07.720
you pick yourself up.

00:07.720 --> 00:13.560
But if on the other hand as a teacher, you indulge in that conversation around, whoa

00:13.560 --> 00:18.480
is me, life is so difficult because my father was an alcoholic or whatever it is, you're

00:18.480 --> 00:19.960
never going to get anywhere.

00:19.960 --> 00:22.840
And maybe life is more difficult for you.

00:22.840 --> 00:23.840
Maybe it's not.

00:23.840 --> 00:24.840
I'm not even getting into that conversation.

00:24.840 --> 00:25.840
I actually don't care.

00:25.840 --> 00:26.840
Who cares?

00:26.840 --> 00:28.680
Yes, maybe somebody was racist towards you.

00:28.680 --> 00:30.320
You're going to let that ruin your life?

00:30.320 --> 00:44.400
Pick yourself up and keep going.

00:44.400 --> 00:50.560
Catherine Berbelsingh is the co-founder and head teacher at Macaela Community School in

00:50.560 --> 00:52.880
Inner London.

00:52.880 --> 00:59.560
After graduating from Oxford, Catherine became a school teacher and rose to prominence when

00:59.560 --> 01:06.280
she gave a speech in 2010 criticising the impact of progressive educational ideas on children's

01:06.280 --> 01:08.840
learning outcomes.

01:08.840 --> 01:14.000
Finding herself without a job anymore because of that very speech, Catherine set about co-founding

01:14.000 --> 01:18.840
her own school and I'm at it now.

01:18.840 --> 01:23.960
It's based explicitly on more traditional educational techniques and social virtues such

01:23.960 --> 01:28.000
as gratitude and personal responsibility.

01:28.000 --> 01:34.720
Since 2010, Catherine has become one of the world's most prominent voices on education

01:34.720 --> 01:39.960
reform and has hundreds of people, including from Australia, visiting her school every

01:39.960 --> 01:44.240
year to take back lessons to apply in their own schools.

01:44.240 --> 01:51.720
She's written and edited four books, including the latest, Macaela, The Power of Culture,

01:51.720 --> 01:58.640
and in 2021 she was appointed chair of the Social Mobility Commission here in the UK.

01:58.640 --> 02:03.600
I have to say, having had the privilege of spending some time at the school and sitting

02:03.600 --> 02:12.000
in on some classes, hearing kids enthusiastically engage, sitting up respectfully, teachers

02:12.000 --> 02:20.440
throwing extraordinary energy into it, discipline, tidiness, focus, you couldn't make this up.

02:20.440 --> 02:25.520
So I start from a place of being quite amazed by what I've seen.

02:25.520 --> 02:31.440
But Catherine, if I could start, you grew up in Canada, in England, you've travelled

02:31.440 --> 02:36.640
the world, you studied French and philosophy at Oxford, and then you went to teach in state

02:36.640 --> 02:37.640
schools.

02:37.640 --> 02:39.000
Have you always wanted to be a teacher?

02:39.000 --> 02:40.880
Is that your great passion in life?

02:40.880 --> 02:46.080
No, I don't think I knew what I wanted to do at Oxford, but then I joined this group

02:46.080 --> 02:53.000
which was about sending students from Oxford into the inner city to talk to young people

02:53.000 --> 02:58.880
in schools about perhaps applying to Oxford or Cambridge.

02:58.880 --> 03:03.920
And the idea was to send students who looked like them, came from their kind of backgrounds,

03:03.920 --> 03:05.300
that kind of thing.

03:05.300 --> 03:09.440
So I would go and I would talk to these kids, and at the beginning they'd say, I'm not

03:09.480 --> 03:12.480
applying to Oxford or Cambridge, just a bunch of snobs, etc.

03:12.480 --> 03:16.480
And by the end of me talking to them, I found that I'd changed some of their minds.

03:16.480 --> 03:21.600
And I thought, oh, well this is really nice, I like this, and I like children, I love children.

03:21.600 --> 03:23.800
And so I chose that as my career.

03:23.800 --> 03:28.720
It was astonishing in some of those classrooms, you can tell the kids that they are really

03:28.720 --> 03:32.040
diverse in every way, I suspect.

03:32.040 --> 03:36.400
Everything from the home environment they've experienced as kids, right through to their

03:36.480 --> 03:42.120
religious practices at home, or none, through to their diets, the whole bit.

03:42.120 --> 03:49.400
But they're all sitting there, attentively getting on with it, as I say, you couldn't

03:49.400 --> 03:50.400
make it up.

03:50.400 --> 03:55.760
But you attracted a lot of attention from the media and your then colleagues, when

03:55.760 --> 04:01.720
you gave a speech at the Conservative Party Conference in 2010, decrying what you called

04:02.200 --> 04:06.600
the culture of excuses in the English education system.

04:06.600 --> 04:10.160
What did you mean by culture of excuses?

04:10.160 --> 04:13.640
Yeah, well, I don't think that you say the English education system, of course I was

04:13.640 --> 04:19.240
speaking about that, but I think you find this all over the place, in Australia, for

04:19.240 --> 04:24.280
instance, I've seen it there myself first hand, having visited some of your schools.

04:24.280 --> 04:29.440
And I think that this is particularly the case for children from poor backgrounds,

04:29.480 --> 04:32.080
from ethnic backgrounds.

04:32.080 --> 04:36.640
In particular, I saw it in Australia when teachers were talking about Aboriginal children.

04:36.640 --> 04:42.280
And it's just low expectations for these children and imagining that they can't really

04:42.280 --> 04:44.520
amount very much.

04:44.520 --> 04:49.640
And, well, he doesn't have a dad at home, so we're not going to expect him to do his

04:49.640 --> 04:55.960
homework, or he lives on that council estate, or he's just from a poor background.

04:55.960 --> 05:01.920
And so it's a bit much to expect him to turn up on time or to have his uniform on or whatever

05:01.920 --> 05:06.160
it is the standards are, you drop them because you feel bad for them.

05:06.160 --> 05:11.160
So it comes from a nice place, you know, these people are being compassionate, but what they

05:11.160 --> 05:15.520
don't understand is that their compassion is killing the child.

05:15.520 --> 05:21.440
And I saw a lot of that in Australia, sadly, in particular, directed towards Aboriginal

05:21.440 --> 05:22.440
children.

05:22.440 --> 05:28.240
I mean, I remember one teacher in one school saying to me that, well, at the end of the

05:28.240 --> 05:30.640
day, these children are going to end up in prison.

05:30.640 --> 05:34.840
So you just have some fun with them while you can before they end up in prison.

05:34.840 --> 05:39.160
And I thought, but if we taught them properly, then maybe they wouldn't end up in prison,

05:39.160 --> 05:40.160
you know.

05:40.160 --> 05:45.520
You know, in one school, I saw them, they were doing a lot of guitar playing.

05:45.520 --> 05:47.920
Well, the children weren't playing guitar.

05:47.920 --> 05:51.120
The teacher was playing guitar, and they were all sort of singing together.

05:51.120 --> 05:54.520
And I don't have anything against singing, but we did this for a very long time.

05:54.520 --> 05:58.960
And I was saying, are there any maths lessons, any English lessons, you know?

05:58.960 --> 06:00.200
And there was none of that.

06:00.200 --> 06:06.880
And I think that sometimes teachers can look at children who come from different backgrounds

06:06.880 --> 06:07.880
to their own.

06:07.880 --> 06:11.640
And this isn't just a race issue, it can also be a socioeconomic issue.

06:11.640 --> 06:17.720
And they sort of other the child, and they see them as so different, and they feel bad

06:17.720 --> 06:22.760
about their own privilege that they've come from a home with two parents or whatever it

06:22.760 --> 06:23.760
is.

06:23.760 --> 06:27.760
And then they feel bad about sort of expecting more from that child.

06:27.760 --> 06:32.440
And in the end, they let that child down because what I always say, if we give a child a detention

06:32.440 --> 06:36.200
for not doing his homework, and people say, well, that's really cruel, I always say, you

06:36.200 --> 06:40.880
know what's cruel is spending your life being functionally illiterate and functionally enumerate.

06:40.880 --> 06:42.040
That's cruel.

06:42.040 --> 06:47.680
And it's really about understanding that if you keep your standards high for them now,

06:47.680 --> 06:50.800
they're going to be able to succeed later.

06:50.800 --> 06:55.440
I just, I don't understand why everyone doesn't see this, but that that that's

06:55.440 --> 06:57.800
I'm absolutely with you.

06:57.800 --> 07:06.360
Why progressives in Australia cannot understand that that that that paternalism that that

07:06.360 --> 07:13.280
sort of soft racism of low expectations, yeah, that's what it is flies in the face of everything

07:13.280 --> 07:15.760
they say they believe in.

07:15.760 --> 07:22.640
I know it's because in the moment of making the decision of holding the line, giving the

07:22.640 --> 07:27.520
detention, ringing the parent, whatever it is, it feels bad.

07:27.520 --> 07:29.880
It makes you feel like you're being mean.

07:29.880 --> 07:35.360
And either you love them enough and follow through, and you love them enough to hold

07:35.360 --> 07:41.680
them to those high standards, or you actually quite love yourself and the way you feel in

07:41.680 --> 07:42.960
that moment.

07:42.960 --> 07:51.680
And you you allow that to trump the desire, the long term desire for the child to succeed.

07:51.680 --> 07:53.240
That's what's going on there.

07:53.240 --> 07:58.200
And people need to sort of be honest with themselves and just think, well, am I actually

07:58.200 --> 08:03.160
dropping my standards for some of these children and and not do it really?

08:03.160 --> 08:05.520
You know, you just got to force yourself.

08:05.520 --> 08:07.080
And and that's what we do here.

08:07.080 --> 08:09.960
We have the same standards for everybody, whatever your background.

08:10.400 --> 08:15.160
So Catherine, as I walk around the school and I say endless photographs of people like

08:15.160 --> 08:19.800
the now Prime Minister Boris Johnson here, members of the Royal Family, of outstanding

08:19.800 --> 08:23.440
sports people, of other educators praising what you do here.

08:23.440 --> 08:28.040
I do notice one interesting one from a man who happens to be an African American just

08:28.040 --> 08:31.920
on the wall here, where you're saying if you really want to serve someone else's interests,

08:31.920 --> 08:32.920
you'll tell them the truth.

08:32.920 --> 08:33.920
Yes.

08:33.920 --> 08:36.680
If you just want to serve your own, you'll tell them what they want to hear.

08:36.680 --> 08:39.480
It's a pretty important philosophy for a teacher, isn't it?

08:39.680 --> 08:41.520
What's really going to serve the child?

08:41.520 --> 08:43.600
Yes, exactly.

08:43.880 --> 08:53.640
So we all know the school where we feel bad about marking them down on their work because

08:53.640 --> 08:54.840
they made a good effort.

08:55.080 --> 09:00.360
And so you give them the A and you tell them it was great, even though it really isn't very good.

09:00.680 --> 09:02.560
But then what happens in the end?

09:02.560 --> 09:04.000
The child thinks he's doing really well.

09:04.000 --> 09:07.600
And then in the end, he fails all these exams and he thinks, well, why am I failing?

09:07.600 --> 09:09.000
You told me I was doing really well.

09:09.280 --> 09:14.960
I mean, for years in this country, we had a whole system of national assessment where

09:14.960 --> 09:17.240
we would give these national assessment grades every year.

09:17.400 --> 09:19.240
They were utterly incomprehensible to everybody.

09:19.240 --> 09:21.960
I mean, parents couldn't understand them, teachers couldn't understand them.

09:22.120 --> 09:27.800
And we all just, it was one A, one B, one C, one A, two A, two B, two C.

09:27.960 --> 09:29.360
And we just used to make it up.

09:29.360 --> 09:31.600
I mean, you would go in there and you think, well, I gave him a two B last time.

09:31.600 --> 09:32.960
I'm talking about two C this time.

09:32.960 --> 09:36.160
I mean, you were just, you were honestly, it was so ridiculous.

09:39.640 --> 09:47.080
Schools can be what everyone needs when it comes to schooling is there

09:47.080 --> 09:48.360
needs to be a goal.

09:49.240 --> 09:51.200
It's not just something that you do.

09:51.200 --> 09:52.880
That's what I find that people think.

09:53.240 --> 09:57.160
You send your child to school and they go and they come home.

09:57.440 --> 10:01.400
You know, so often when I've said to journalists, you don't understand.

10:01.600 --> 10:03.280
Schools are failing our children.

10:03.560 --> 10:06.600
And every single one of them will say to me, but our schools are fine.

10:06.760 --> 10:07.680
What do you mean?

10:07.720 --> 10:09.520
My child's okay and he's at school.

10:10.000 --> 10:11.240
And I say, how do you know?

10:11.960 --> 10:14.920
And they'll say, well, he's okay.

10:14.920 --> 10:16.480
I say, but he comes home from school.

10:17.440 --> 10:18.640
You ask him, how was your day?

10:18.840 --> 10:20.280
He says, fine.

10:20.800 --> 10:21.520
He goes to his room.

10:22.120 --> 10:24.280
Well, how do you know?

10:24.640 --> 10:26.240
You don't know what's going on in his classroom.

10:26.520 --> 10:28.000
You don't know the quality of the teaching.

10:28.000 --> 10:30.400
You don't know the quality of the questioning, the quality of the explanations,

10:30.400 --> 10:31.200
the quality of the homework.

10:31.200 --> 10:33.480
Does the homework actually match what they were doing in the lesson in the first

10:33.480 --> 10:36.200
place? Is it drilling them in the right things that they need to know?

10:36.400 --> 10:38.800
Is it like, you have no idea.

10:39.000 --> 10:40.760
Is it stretching them where they need to be stretched?

10:40.960 --> 10:44.120
Is it encouraging independent thought in this kind of way, but making sure that

10:44.120 --> 10:45.640
the basis is covered in another kind of way?

10:45.840 --> 10:49.360
Like there's so I could go on for hours about the details of what makes a good

10:49.360 --> 10:51.000
teacher and what makes for good teaching.

10:52.000 --> 10:55.320
Too often people think that teaching is just something you do when you couldn't

10:55.320 --> 11:01.080
do something else, when actually it is, you know, a game for only the super

11:01.080 --> 11:02.320
talented, right?

11:02.600 --> 11:10.600
Well, I couldn't believe the energy and the drive and the engagement with their

11:10.600 --> 11:13.840
students that I saw amongst five or six of your teachers today.

11:13.840 --> 11:15.080
It was astonishing.

11:15.360 --> 11:19.600
They must be utterly worn out of the end of the term, let alone the end,

11:19.800 --> 11:21.080
you know, probably the end of the day.

11:21.360 --> 11:27.680
Well, that's a really interesting point because I would say, and I know this

11:27.680 --> 11:32.000
from talking to my teachers, they are less worn out here than they were at

11:32.000 --> 11:32.840
their other schools.

11:33.040 --> 11:33.720
Fascinating.

11:33.840 --> 11:36.760
And it's true that they're giving their heart and soul and they absolutely

11:36.760 --> 11:38.320
love it and they love the kids and so on.

11:38.760 --> 11:43.280
But they're also not having to deal with rudeness, chat back to them, you

11:43.280 --> 11:48.640
know, kids marching out of lessons, them having to bring irate parents, dealing

11:48.640 --> 11:51.600
with that, there's none of that kind of friction.

11:51.880 --> 11:54.440
So emotionally, it's a lot less draining.

11:55.000 --> 12:00.560
It's true that they give a lot, but they do, they're not as drained as they,

12:01.280 --> 12:02.360
as they were at their other schools.

12:02.800 --> 12:04.480
But teaching is tiring.

12:04.640 --> 12:05.360
It's very tiring.

12:05.360 --> 12:08.920
I have the, you know, whether it's because of the disciplinary problems,

12:08.920 --> 12:11.920
which I don't blame the teachers for, you know, some of them are to blame,

12:11.920 --> 12:15.720
but not a lot, most of them are not, whether it's the expectations, the

12:15.720 --> 12:17.280
report writing and so forth put on them.

12:17.600 --> 12:21.560
I fully accept it is a very demanding profession and one that ought to be

12:22.000 --> 12:24.480
better recognized in every way by the community.

12:24.800 --> 12:29.120
But, but now back to, so you gave that speech, you know, you, you dared to talk

12:29.120 --> 12:33.520
about some culture of excesses, and suddenly you're out on your ear.

12:33.520 --> 12:34.840
No one wants to employ you.

12:35.000 --> 12:35.480
Yes.

12:35.880 --> 12:40.280
It was quite a struggle to start the school, I don't imagine, to find people

12:40.280 --> 12:42.400
who'd support you, the local government authorities.

12:42.400 --> 12:46.400
So this is again, this problem of who's thinking of the kids' real interests?

12:46.440 --> 12:46.880
Yes.

12:47.240 --> 12:47.640
Yeah.

12:47.760 --> 12:52.560
Well, unfortunately, education is real political football at the time.

12:52.560 --> 12:55.440
The Conservative Party were the ones that introduced this idea of free schools.

12:56.440 --> 13:00.200
I decided that I needed to set up my own school because I just couldn't get back

13:00.200 --> 13:04.040
into the state sector because they wouldn't have me because I'd done the

13:04.040 --> 13:06.840
unthinkable and I'd spoken at the Conservative Party and that really is

13:06.840 --> 13:08.960
just a no-no when it comes to education.

13:09.520 --> 13:12.680
And not that anybody says that to you, but you just kind of know that that's

13:12.680 --> 13:13.440
what's going on.

13:13.600 --> 13:14.920
That's where our culture works now.

13:14.920 --> 13:16.760
You know when you've been quietly cancelled.

13:16.840 --> 13:17.440
Exactly.

13:17.440 --> 13:20.040
And it's interesting because it was before council culture became a thing,

13:20.040 --> 13:23.760
but I was one of the earlier cancellations as it were, you know.

13:23.920 --> 13:24.960
That's very encouraging.

13:25.080 --> 13:26.800
There might be people out there feeling cancelled.

13:26.800 --> 13:27.600
You can survive it.

13:27.800 --> 13:32.720
You can, but it's true that it takes an enormous amount of guts and determination.

13:32.720 --> 13:36.200
So for three and a half years, I worked to be able to set up this school.

13:36.400 --> 13:43.000
We had all kinds of detractors protesting, sending me horrible emails, death threats,

13:43.000 --> 13:44.040
all kind of craziness.

13:44.040 --> 13:45.960
I mean, like just you wouldn't believe it.

13:46.120 --> 13:51.440
I kept saying, you'd think we were creating, you know, building nuclear bombs.

13:51.440 --> 13:55.600
I mean, we were just trying to set up a school in the inner city to help

13:55.600 --> 13:57.280
children who are deprived.

13:57.360 --> 13:58.920
I mean, what is the problem?

13:59.440 --> 14:00.640
But they really didn't like me.

14:00.640 --> 14:02.560
One, because I'd spoken at the Conservative Party Conference.

14:02.560 --> 14:04.160
Two, because of the things I was saying.

14:04.400 --> 14:08.680
So I was saying that the system wasn't good enough and you're not allowed

14:08.680 --> 14:11.560
to criticize education and I was doing it openly.

14:12.160 --> 14:16.240
I still do it, you know, and that's because I think you criticize what you love.

14:16.400 --> 14:19.800
You know, if you're not critical and if you don't hold the education system

14:19.800 --> 14:23.360
to high standards, then we'll all just bob along being mediocre and we don't want that.

14:23.760 --> 14:26.280
So we set up the school eventually.

14:26.280 --> 14:29.040
But when I say there were protests, I mean, there were people when we had our first

14:29.040 --> 14:33.360
year group, 120 year seven kids, so 11 year olds here.

14:34.360 --> 14:38.640
There were people protesting outside, handing them leaflets, telling them their

14:38.640 --> 14:42.560
lives were in danger in this building because it was a health and safety hazard.

14:42.560 --> 14:44.240
I mean, can you imagine this building?

14:44.520 --> 14:46.400
Yeah, it's one of the best school buildings I've seen.

14:46.440 --> 14:49.600
Well, at the time we were doing refurbishments.

14:49.600 --> 14:52.120
You had to walk through a kind of tunnel to get through.

14:52.320 --> 14:56.320
And of course, all the self health and safety boxes had been ticked,

14:56.640 --> 14:59.360
but they were just making up any nonsense.

15:00.280 --> 15:03.400
Any form of storm in true Catherine fashion.

15:03.720 --> 15:07.200
I saw a couple of these flyers that they were handing them.

15:07.200 --> 15:08.320
So I took the flyer.

15:08.320 --> 15:11.440
I photocopied it 120 times and I gave it to all the children.

15:11.600 --> 15:15.160
And I said, when you go outside and see them, you can wave it in their faces

15:15.160 --> 15:18.400
and you can say my headmistress has already given me a copy.

15:18.400 --> 15:19.560
Well done. That was clever.

15:19.960 --> 15:20.800
It was very clever.

15:20.800 --> 15:25.200
I'll come to silencing the critics by the all performance in a moment.

15:25.200 --> 15:31.760
But before I do, so you set up in 2014, you finally found a building,

15:31.880 --> 15:36.920
a council that would support you, despite that opposition locally that you talked about.

15:37.800 --> 15:38.960
But you said there's a very interesting.

15:38.960 --> 15:42.600
It's anti progressivist in its philosophical origins.

15:43.200 --> 15:47.520
What do you mean by progressivist educational philosophy?

15:47.840 --> 15:51.280
And just as a matter of interest, how might parents identify it?

15:51.280 --> 15:54.480
Because I think a lot of parents are confused about what's happening in schools.

15:54.600 --> 15:57.280
Yeah, no, that's very true.

15:57.280 --> 16:00.800
And I think, you know, a lot of our kids come here because we're in too many schools,

16:00.800 --> 16:02.840
I should say, rather than blanket them all.

16:02.840 --> 16:04.080
But in too many schools, yeah.

16:04.080 --> 16:05.080
Yeah.

16:07.160 --> 16:12.840
Well, actually, I'd probably say the vast majority of schools are too progressive.

16:13.760 --> 16:15.160
There are very few.

16:15.160 --> 16:17.280
Yes, absolutely.

16:17.280 --> 16:18.560
There are very few schools.

16:18.560 --> 16:21.080
You have to go against the zeitgeist.

16:21.280 --> 16:29.000
You have to have made a firm decision to to throw out what everyone's telling you to do.

16:29.200 --> 16:32.720
And there are a few heads out there who do that, but we are few and far between.

16:33.280 --> 16:37.240
And so that's why I say the vast majority, because the teacher training institutions,

16:37.400 --> 16:42.400
the general culture in 2022 is one of progressivism.

16:42.560 --> 16:44.760
So what do we mean by that?

16:45.040 --> 16:49.160
Advice for the parents who are watching is when you go into the classrooms,

16:49.320 --> 16:53.880
are the desks grouped together so that the children are facing each other?

16:54.000 --> 16:59.080
So we're in a classroom right now here and the desks are facing the front of the classroom

16:59.280 --> 17:02.440
and the teacher would be at the front, leading the learning.

17:03.000 --> 17:06.000
In other progressive classrooms, the desks are grouped together.

17:06.280 --> 17:10.560
And then the idea is the children are the ones leading the learning, not the teacher.

17:10.880 --> 17:14.440
And then the teacher gives them a task which they get on with together.

17:14.840 --> 17:19.280
So they're leading the learning together and the teacher might move amongst the desks,

17:19.560 --> 17:23.280
keeping them on task, as opposed to the teacher being at the front,

17:23.280 --> 17:25.840
being the figure of authority and leading that learning.

17:26.080 --> 17:27.920
So that's one very obvious way to tell.

17:28.960 --> 17:31.640
Then there's just the values stuff.

17:31.920 --> 17:36.360
You know, when you read their website, do they talk about tradition?

17:36.640 --> 17:41.520
Do they talk about valuing, having traditional values?

17:42.280 --> 17:44.400
Or do they say we're very modern?

17:44.400 --> 17:46.360
Do they talk a lot about technology?

17:46.680 --> 17:52.320
Do they talk about, you know, children finding themselves?

17:52.320 --> 17:54.080
That's the kind of thing that they might say.

17:54.360 --> 17:57.200
Now, you think, well, why wouldn't you want a child to find themselves?

17:57.440 --> 17:58.640
I'm not against that.

17:58.840 --> 18:01.000
It's just that's the phrasing that they'll use.

18:01.000 --> 18:02.120
That's where you look really, isn't it?

18:02.520 --> 18:08.600
Yeah, so children finding themselves, children, you know, being who they want to be,

18:08.880 --> 18:12.840
that kind of thing, as opposed to we're more of a traditional outfit

18:12.960 --> 18:17.400
where we believe children need to acquire knowledge and skills to succeed at life.

18:18.000 --> 18:22.040
And we are here to teach them and guide them and lead them

18:22.160 --> 18:23.920
and look after them and love them.

18:23.920 --> 18:27.200
You know, that that that's all under the traditional umbrella.

18:27.440 --> 18:32.480
The progressive umbrella is children need to explore for themselves.

18:32.680 --> 18:38.120
Children need to be free to express themselves

18:38.280 --> 18:40.120
and to find who they are, as it were.

18:40.480 --> 18:44.560
And the thing is, some viewers might listen to that and go, that sounds really great.

18:45.160 --> 18:48.120
The problem with progressivism is that it's so seductive

18:48.360 --> 18:51.440
because you listen to it and you think, that's what I want as an adult.

18:51.440 --> 18:52.440
I want to be free.

18:52.440 --> 18:53.880
I want to express myself.

18:53.880 --> 18:57.640
I want to find who I am, and that's absolutely fine for an adult.

18:58.560 --> 19:02.800
The thing is, is that children are not experts and children need guidance.

19:03.000 --> 19:07.200
So when you take your four year old out to the road, you don't say, here's the road.

19:07.640 --> 19:10.640
Go find yourself, because he'll get squashed by a car.

19:11.080 --> 19:16.360
What you do is you hold his hand and you gradually teach him how to cross the road

19:16.640 --> 19:19.440
until eventually he's able to do it on his own.

19:20.000 --> 19:21.240
And that will take years.

19:21.240 --> 19:24.920
It takes years to get a child to the point where he can cross the road on his own

19:25.160 --> 19:26.480
because he has to look both ways.

19:26.480 --> 19:28.600
He has to have a sense of when the car is going to stop.

19:28.840 --> 19:32.120
He then needs to be able to get across the road in a quick and safe manner.

19:32.320 --> 19:36.320
There are so many skills that are involved there in crossing the road.

19:36.760 --> 19:40.200
And I have to say, most parents instinctively know not to just allow

19:40.200 --> 19:42.240
their child to be free when it comes to crossing the road.

19:42.720 --> 19:45.720
They don't necessarily know that when it comes to the classroom.

19:45.880 --> 19:47.440
It's the same with anything.

19:47.560 --> 19:52.000
You need children to be habituated and to be drilled in the basics

19:52.240 --> 19:54.040
so that they could then build up from that.

19:54.120 --> 19:56.280
And you scaffold them the whole time.

19:56.400 --> 20:00.440
You're there as their parent or their teacher, constantly scaffolding,

20:00.600 --> 20:05.480
helping them get to a point where, yes, they are then adults and they are free

20:05.640 --> 20:11.000
to be able to succeed and fail and try again and fail again and so on.

20:11.360 --> 20:16.360
But unless they've had that that traditional scaffolding and teaching

20:16.360 --> 20:19.880
of knowledge and skills, if that hasn't happened properly

20:20.040 --> 20:23.560
because they have been left to child-centered learning

20:23.560 --> 20:26.880
where they are leading themselves, they simply won't know as much

20:26.880 --> 20:29.240
as the child who's been in the more traditional classroom.

20:29.600 --> 20:34.760
I must say, I was just I could not get over the bond between teacher and student.

20:36.200 --> 20:41.240
All eyes on the teacher, the teacher engaging with enormous energy.

20:41.880 --> 20:44.600
And I was looking for the kid who didn't put their hand up

20:45.320 --> 20:49.520
when that was time to answer a question or maybe I couldn't find one.

20:50.520 --> 20:51.840
I'm a bit. Well, there are some.

20:51.840 --> 20:54.280
But yeah, I didn't find one today.

20:54.920 --> 20:57.280
Just the dynamics of it were extraordinary.

20:57.640 --> 21:00.440
So let's drill into this a bit more.

21:00.440 --> 21:02.800
You've been going since 2014.

21:02.920 --> 21:05.160
So you've got a bit of an idea of how it's working now.

21:05.440 --> 21:07.160
Yeah. Is it silencing the critics?

21:07.160 --> 21:08.800
What's it look like success?

21:08.800 --> 21:12.280
Yeah, because it's about more than just academic results.

21:12.280 --> 21:14.800
But my guess is the academic results are good.

21:15.200 --> 21:17.720
What do you see about the students that have been right through now?

21:18.080 --> 21:20.400
Yes. And is it silencing the critics?

21:21.040 --> 21:22.960
Oh, many of them, it has science.

21:23.840 --> 21:26.000
There were a whole bunch of people who were very vocal before

21:26.000 --> 21:28.640
who were protesting outside and so on. We don't get protesters anymore.

21:28.880 --> 21:32.360
So in that sense, it's been a huge success.

21:32.800 --> 21:36.840
A lot of people who were on the fence, I find I have a lot of people

21:36.840 --> 21:39.680
following me on Twitter and I find I'll go to a conference.

21:39.680 --> 21:42.440
I'll be on the street and somebody will run up to me and say,

21:43.760 --> 21:46.600
I can't say this out loud, but I just want you to know you have my support.

21:48.760 --> 21:50.320
Be useful. I did say it out loud.

21:50.320 --> 21:52.800
I know, but I don't I don't blame them. I get it.

21:53.000 --> 21:55.960
So there are I have a lot of silence supporters

21:56.080 --> 21:58.160
and silent followers who never say anything.

21:58.280 --> 22:01.680
And I must always remind myself of this because sometimes I can get

22:02.520 --> 22:05.160
distracted by the the vocal minorities.

22:05.160 --> 22:07.360
I do think they are a vocal minority.

22:07.360 --> 22:11.840
It's just that the minority have the power.

22:12.080 --> 22:13.080
That's the thing.

22:13.080 --> 22:14.760
They have the media outlets.

22:14.760 --> 22:18.680
They have the politicians ears or they are actually the politicians.

22:19.640 --> 22:24.080
And so those people are they just have so much power.

22:24.320 --> 22:28.280
It's ordinary families who where they don't have any power at all,

22:28.440 --> 22:30.400
who might be supportive, but they just can't say anything.

22:31.120 --> 22:33.000
Families and then teachers, ordinary teachers,

22:33.120 --> 22:35.640
we get over 600 visitors a year who come to the school.

22:35.800 --> 22:37.080
Most of those are teachers.

22:37.080 --> 22:38.880
Some of those are Australian teachers.

22:39.040 --> 22:42.320
I have I've had Australian teachers writing to me who have never been here,

22:42.560 --> 22:45.600
but saying because I've been on some Australian news bit.

22:45.600 --> 22:46.920
And, you know, yes, you have.

22:46.920 --> 22:50.600
So I'll I'll I'll be in the news and then I'll get we'll get a few emails

22:50.600 --> 22:51.920
through to the website here.

22:51.920 --> 22:55.280
They get on the school website to say, I wish there were teachers like you in

22:55.280 --> 22:57.240
Australia, you know, this is the kind of thing they say.

22:57.680 --> 23:01.760
So I know and and from teachers, you know,

23:01.760 --> 23:04.040
this isn't this isn't just from families.

23:04.040 --> 23:05.440
This is from teachers.

23:05.440 --> 23:09.840
So and I think sometimes families can think, oh, these teachers,

23:10.120 --> 23:11.880
why are they the way they are?

23:11.880 --> 23:15.320
What I need to let everyone know is that there are a whole load of teachers

23:15.320 --> 23:17.240
who do agree with what I'm saying.

23:17.240 --> 23:18.760
It's just they don't have a voice.

23:18.760 --> 23:21.640
They're not in positions of leadership or management in their school.

23:21.920 --> 23:24.560
There isn't much that they can do and they're trying.

23:24.800 --> 23:30.120
But the culture, we our book, we have two books as a school.

23:30.120 --> 23:31.120
We've written them.

23:31.120 --> 23:33.720
We all my teachers write a chapter about the kinds of things we've done.

23:34.160 --> 23:35.960
And you must have one when you go.

23:36.120 --> 23:39.040
And the second one is called the power of culture.

23:39.600 --> 23:44.200
And people underestimate how much a culture in an organization

23:44.440 --> 23:47.840
affects what happens to the people in that organization.

23:48.080 --> 23:52.360
So the children you saw and you said all the hands went up.

23:52.600 --> 23:54.240
That's because that's the culture.

23:54.240 --> 23:56.880
The culture is if I know the answer, I'm putting my hand up, you know,

23:57.240 --> 23:58.600
and I'm excited about it.

23:58.600 --> 24:02.120
And the culture is one of I want to show off how much I know,

24:02.320 --> 24:06.000
as opposed to if I put my hand up, I'm the nerd of the class

24:06.000 --> 24:07.360
and everybody's going to laugh at me.

24:07.360 --> 24:09.440
So I don't want to be seen to be putting my hand up.

24:09.760 --> 24:14.200
That we have actively worked very hard to create a culture

24:14.400 --> 24:16.520
where the kids are really excited about learning.

24:16.520 --> 24:18.080
And that's a hard one to achieve.

24:18.080 --> 24:21.040
But, you know, and I was about to say, well, once you've got it,

24:21.040 --> 24:23.920
but actually you then have to work at just keeping it all the time.

24:24.000 --> 24:27.120
You know, and that comes from consistency across all your teachers,

24:28.120 --> 24:30.760
a consistency of approach in terms of teaching,

24:31.280 --> 24:35.440
in terms of expectations of the children and in terms of behavior management.

24:35.720 --> 24:40.000
And that's where you see other teachers and other schools will struggle

24:40.320 --> 24:44.040
because doing it on your own in a classroom

24:44.360 --> 24:48.840
where the whole school isn't bought into what you're doing is very, very hard.

24:49.280 --> 24:50.400
I can understand that.

24:50.400 --> 24:54.040
So tell me, eight years in,

24:54.120 --> 24:57.280
you've got obviously now quite a few students who have left the school.

24:58.040 --> 25:02.040
So how have they gone in exam terms and then out into,

25:02.040 --> 25:04.800
if you like, the big wide world beyond the school?

25:05.120 --> 25:08.240
Yeah, so we only had one set of GCSE results

25:08.960 --> 25:11.280
with our first cohort because, of course, COVID then happened.

25:11.560 --> 25:14.880
So there's not been anything national to talk about.

25:15.160 --> 25:18.200
This will be the first year where that does happen.

25:18.280 --> 25:22.360
But we, you know, in terms of our progress eight,

25:22.360 --> 25:26.280
which judges the progress from when they arrive to when they leave,

25:26.600 --> 25:28.760
we were the fifth best school in the country.

25:29.640 --> 25:32.800
Right. So we did well, you know, now.

25:32.800 --> 25:36.040
Fifth best in an area that would normally be seen as very disadvantageous.

25:36.040 --> 25:37.280
Yeah, yeah, exactly, exactly.

25:37.280 --> 25:40.480
Where many of the children would have had a very tough start in life.

25:40.480 --> 25:41.120
Yes, yeah.

25:41.120 --> 25:42.800
They didn't get the good foundations.

25:42.800 --> 25:45.480
Yes, but that's what we have to do when they arrive in year seven.

25:45.720 --> 25:47.600
A lot of it is is damage control,

25:47.600 --> 25:50.120
making sure that we get the basics into them

25:50.120 --> 25:52.840
because they haven't necessarily picked that up at primary school.

25:53.320 --> 25:56.640
Unless you're competing with some of the most expensive institutions

25:56.640 --> 25:58.480
in the world when it comes to education.

25:58.480 --> 26:01.400
Well, remember, this is progress that they've made that they're judging.

26:01.640 --> 26:03.320
So it's not that our children, I mean,

26:03.320 --> 26:05.560
some of them are doing very well and have gone off to Oxford and Cambridge,

26:05.560 --> 26:07.080
but we have a comprehensive intake.

26:07.080 --> 26:08.560
So you've had kids here.

26:08.560 --> 26:11.640
Yeah, yeah, if the school had not been here,

26:11.640 --> 26:13.920
would any of those kids who have gone to Oxford and Cambridge

26:14.160 --> 26:16.440
gone to Oxford and Cambridge?

26:16.440 --> 26:17.640
Well, it's hard to say.

26:17.640 --> 26:19.320
I mean, it's hard to say.

26:19.320 --> 26:20.360
It's hard to imagine.

26:20.360 --> 26:22.320
I mean, to be honest, it's less

26:22.760 --> 26:25.080
I'm less proud of the Oxford and Cambridge kids

26:25.080 --> 26:29.360
and more proud of the kids who were in the bottom set, third set.

26:29.360 --> 26:35.240
You know, the ones who aren't cognitively, you know, super brilliant.

26:35.760 --> 26:39.840
And they know how to bring all their equipment to school,

26:39.880 --> 26:42.280
how to sit up straight, how to have their hand up,

26:42.360 --> 26:43.840
how to be interested in learning.

26:43.840 --> 26:45.400
They know lots of Shakespeare.

26:45.400 --> 26:50.200
They are able to go to a job interview and shake your hand and look you in the eye.

26:50.440 --> 26:52.800
They're able to know their stuff and talk about it.

26:52.800 --> 26:56.440
You know, they're functionally literate and exactly.

26:56.720 --> 26:57.520
They're more than that.

26:57.520 --> 26:59.600
I mean, you know, they get decent GCSEs.

26:59.600 --> 27:04.760
I mean, and the thing is, is that when they when they're out in life now,

27:04.880 --> 27:07.160
you know, some of them will become hairdressers and plumbers

27:07.160 --> 27:10.080
and all sorts of, you know, different jobs.

27:10.680 --> 27:13.280
But they're going to be really good at those jobs and they're going to live

27:13.280 --> 27:14.480
successful lives.

27:14.480 --> 27:17.000
Those are the ones I'm most proud of, because those are often the ones

27:17.000 --> 27:20.480
that the system fails, whereas the really bright ones.

27:20.600 --> 27:23.960
I mean, yes, of course, are ones who went to Oxford and Cambridge and proud of them.

27:24.200 --> 27:25.840
And we did a lot for them.

27:25.840 --> 27:26.840
Would they have got there or not?

27:26.840 --> 27:28.520
I don't know. It's hard to say.

27:28.520 --> 27:33.520
But yeah, it really is those other ones who who are often given

27:33.520 --> 27:38.160
such a rough deal by the school system, you know, because they can't make up for it.

27:38.240 --> 27:40.240
Because of the soft paternalism.

27:40.240 --> 27:44.840
Yeah, because because of all the low expectations, the low expectations for them.

27:44.840 --> 27:46.640
I mean, it's the same for all the kids, frankly.

27:46.640 --> 27:51.600
You know, I find everywhere it's just too much that excuses are made for them.

27:52.040 --> 27:56.120
But when you're super bright, you can you can sort of get around that.

27:56.120 --> 28:00.280
Even if your teachers have low expectations, you've got really high expectations for yourself.

28:00.480 --> 28:03.840
So you end up working loads at home and you can you can overcome that.

28:05.560 --> 28:06.960
But a lot of kids can't do that.

28:06.960 --> 28:09.080
They need the support and the scaffolding from school.

28:10.240 --> 28:16.520
One of the the sort of soft paternalism that that we hear is they're not

28:16.520 --> 28:20.920
responsible for the situation that they're in will excuse them.

28:21.200 --> 28:23.440
We won't raise expectations.

28:23.440 --> 28:26.920
But you actually place a lot of emphasis on individual responsibility.

28:27.920 --> 28:33.240
And if I'm reading it correctly, you think it's very important for disadvantaged kids,

28:33.240 --> 28:36.120
the very ones that we usually try and say it's not their fault.

28:36.400 --> 28:39.400
Yeah, well, you're driving out because

28:41.200 --> 28:45.800
disadvantaged children, most of all, need you to hold your standard tie for them

28:46.040 --> 28:48.880
so that they gain the knowledge and the skills that they need to succeed in life.

28:49.160 --> 28:52.800
If you keep making excuses for them, then they're not going to achieve

28:52.800 --> 28:54.080
the things they need to achieve.

28:54.080 --> 28:55.080
And then what happens?

28:55.080 --> 28:58.440
I mean, you always got to ask yourself when they leave you and they leave school,

28:58.680 --> 28:59.760
what happens to them?

28:59.760 --> 29:03.000
If they haven't really learned how to read properly, if they're not numerate,

29:03.160 --> 29:05.000
then how on earth are they going to succeed in life?

29:05.000 --> 29:06.160
They're going to become a victim.

29:06.160 --> 29:07.160
Well, indeed.

29:07.160 --> 29:11.360
And if you are constantly stoking that victimhood, that sense of victimhood in them,

29:11.520 --> 29:15.840
because the other thing is that, look, you can see yourself as a victim

29:15.920 --> 29:18.200
or you can see yourself as somebody who's going to succeed.

29:18.600 --> 29:22.280
And it doesn't really matter whatever background you've got.

29:22.280 --> 29:24.840
You've got to see yourself as somebody who's going to succeed,

29:24.840 --> 29:28.320
because you've only got one life and you've got to be able to make a success of it.

29:28.480 --> 29:31.280
And if you're somebody who sits around saying life is so hard for me,

29:31.280 --> 29:33.840
my father was never around, life is hard for me.

29:33.840 --> 29:37.960
I'm growing up in the inner city, life is hard for me because I don't have much money.

29:38.200 --> 29:39.360
Well, you can do that.

29:39.360 --> 29:42.120
And then one day you'll die and you can look, you'll be on your deathbed.

29:42.120 --> 29:44.640
You look back and you say, well, I couldn't really do anything with my life

29:44.640 --> 29:46.240
because I was an ethnic minority.

29:46.240 --> 29:47.960
I mean, that's just ridiculous.

29:47.960 --> 29:51.160
You have got, it doesn't matter what you've got, the cards you've got.

29:51.400 --> 29:53.080
Those are the cards you were dealt with.

29:53.080 --> 29:56.800
There's nothing you can do about those cards, but you can change the way you react

29:56.800 --> 29:57.920
to those cards.

29:57.920 --> 30:01.000
You are in control of what you do with those cards.

30:01.360 --> 30:06.200
And who, who are we to lower our expectations for these children

30:06.200 --> 30:07.680
and say they can't make it?

30:07.680 --> 30:10.120
Like it, for me, it's just racism.

30:10.120 --> 30:11.360
It's straight up racism.

30:11.360 --> 30:14.320
And it's racism that I would say is directed also at poor white kids.

30:14.320 --> 30:16.640
You know, so it's not just against ethnic minorities.

30:16.880 --> 30:19.920
It's against any child who is the other.

30:20.240 --> 30:25.040
And too often the white middle class is other children who are not like them.

30:25.520 --> 30:28.040
And they, they wouldn't do it for their own children.

30:28.240 --> 30:30.120
They keep their standards high for their own children.

30:30.120 --> 30:33.280
But when it comes to other people's children, they then lower those standards

30:33.440 --> 30:35.680
because they feel that it makes them into the nicer person.

30:37.200 --> 30:37.880
And actually it doesn't.

30:37.880 --> 30:39.960
It makes you into the person who lets those children down.

30:41.000 --> 30:43.800
That's a very valuable insight and thank you for it.

30:44.560 --> 30:48.960
Now, to come to the more traditional approach that you've adopted, and I've seen it,

30:49.440 --> 30:52.800
you're teaching European literature, plenty of Shakespeare.

30:53.360 --> 30:58.000
You've even praised patriotism and the importance of all children, regardless

30:58.040 --> 31:01.360
of race, feeling positively connected to their British heritage.

31:01.560 --> 31:03.400
Yeah. I mean, in Australia, you get the impression

31:03.400 --> 31:04.880
a lot of kids are actually being raised.

31:04.880 --> 31:06.840
Not I'm not blaming teachers actually for this.

31:07.440 --> 31:11.440
But culturally, we're saying to them, you're inheriting such a nightmarish,

31:11.440 --> 31:17.280
oppressive, post-colonialist, racist society that you ought to be ashamed of.

31:17.280 --> 31:18.680
But don't defend it.

31:18.680 --> 31:20.320
You're flying in the opposite direction.

31:20.320 --> 31:23.960
You're actually saying to kids with nothing in their own heritage as British,

31:24.200 --> 31:25.440
that it matters.

31:25.480 --> 31:28.600
So so what's the value in teaching the Western canon?

31:29.120 --> 31:33.960
And what do you say to those who say that's irrelevant or, you know,

31:33.960 --> 31:37.760
you're you're you're making things that were bad sound good.

31:37.760 --> 31:40.160
You're instilling them with bad ideas.

31:41.040 --> 31:46.320
Yeah. And I suppose it depends on whether or not you think Shakespeare is worth reading.

31:46.560 --> 31:50.720
You know, I think he's worth reading simply for the if only because he's been

31:50.720 --> 31:53.440
influencing literature for 400 years, you know?

31:53.680 --> 31:56.480
I mean, they say, oh, no, we need to have more black authors.

31:56.480 --> 31:59.040
Well, you know, I'm a black author, you know, I've written books,

31:59.200 --> 32:02.200
but never in a million years would I have my children be reading the things

32:02.200 --> 32:05.240
I've written over Shakespeare, because I have been influencing

32:05.600 --> 32:06.960
literature for 400 years.

32:06.960 --> 32:10.400
If the day that's what you're reading, then some of the other rubbish they're reading.

32:11.200 --> 32:14.880
Well, you know, I'm I'm not even judging one way or the other.

32:15.040 --> 32:20.240
The fact is that the Western canon is is what schools should be about.

32:20.480 --> 32:22.560
Now, when you get to university, you know what?

32:22.560 --> 32:24.480
You can do a whole variety of different things there.

32:24.480 --> 32:25.920
I don't mind that, you know?

32:27.040 --> 32:30.040
You want to look at feminist literature, black literature, all sorts of things.

32:30.040 --> 32:33.400
That's fine. And in school, I'm not saying you can't have any of that.

32:33.400 --> 32:38.280
You know, we do, you know, we were just reading with our six

32:38.280 --> 32:40.920
former in English A level, we're doing Small Island,

32:40.920 --> 32:43.600
which is this wonderful story by Andrea Levy,

32:45.000 --> 32:49.720
who writes about black people coming from the Caribbean to Britain.

32:50.560 --> 32:52.800
On the Windrush and their experiences here.

32:52.960 --> 32:55.800
So it's not like we're saying no to any of that.

32:56.000 --> 32:58.680
But what we're not doing is campaigning against dead white men.

32:58.920 --> 33:04.120
And we include a lot of dead white men in what we do because they're part of the canon.

33:05.280 --> 33:07.760
They write beautiful things.

33:07.880 --> 33:13.040
I once had a journalist from the Sunday Times, I think it was.

33:13.640 --> 33:17.920
He came here and he heard all of our children reciting the poem

33:17.960 --> 33:21.200
If by Rudyard Kippling and he said,

33:21.480 --> 33:24.320
that's very controversial, Catherine. Are you doing it deliberately?

33:25.520 --> 33:27.760
And I said, but it's a very beautiful poem.

33:28.000 --> 33:31.520
And not only is it a beautiful poem, it just speaks to the heart of what we're about.

33:31.600 --> 33:35.520
Right. We want the children to embody those values that are in the poem If.

33:35.600 --> 33:38.120
If you didn't keep your head when all around lose this.

33:38.280 --> 33:40.080
Exactly. Exactly.

33:40.080 --> 33:43.920
If you can, you know, treat triumph and disaster as both the same.

33:43.920 --> 33:46.600
You know, there's so many wonderful lines in there.

33:46.840 --> 33:48.400
Mix with a common man.

33:48.400 --> 33:50.640
Exactly. And not lose the common touch.

33:50.640 --> 33:52.960
Yes. Yeah. I mean, like, it's just.

33:54.160 --> 34:01.200
It we choose literature according to what we think will benefit them in terms of values,

34:01.360 --> 34:06.560
but also with the canon in mind because we want them to go off and be culturally literate.

34:06.840 --> 34:10.960
So ultimately, you want them to be able to open up a broad sheet newspaper

34:10.960 --> 34:12.720
and understand all the references.

34:12.760 --> 34:17.360
You want them to be able to read a rose would smell as sweet and know what that means.

34:17.360 --> 34:21.440
You want them to understand when they hear on the radio, oh, he's a bit of a scrooge

34:21.600 --> 34:26.040
and you understand what they need, you know, because otherwise your children,

34:26.120 --> 34:28.640
it's not just about being able to decode words.

34:28.640 --> 34:33.240
Reading and being successful at reading is not just about decoding.

34:33.720 --> 34:38.480
It's about the cultural references that are in the text that you are reading.

34:38.760 --> 34:44.960
And there is so much reference to those dead white men to the Western canon in the West.

34:45.160 --> 34:47.640
Look, if if we were in China, I wouldn't be suggesting this.

34:47.840 --> 34:49.680
We'd be reading Chinese literature, right?

34:50.200 --> 34:54.440
So we we are looking at British history.

34:54.680 --> 34:56.600
We are looking at British literature.

34:56.600 --> 34:58.680
We celebrate the Queen's birthday.

34:58.680 --> 35:02.200
We sing God Save the Queen and I've Out of the My Country and Jerusalem.

35:03.080 --> 35:06.280
And we do this with pride because we are all British here.

35:06.520 --> 35:14.000
And the idea that white teachers should be telling brown and black children

35:14.000 --> 35:17.120
that they're not British, it's I think it's horrifying.

35:18.520 --> 35:22.160
My little brown and black children are just as entitled to call themselves

35:22.160 --> 35:24.280
British as any of the white children are.

35:24.600 --> 35:27.880
And and we're all together as one.

35:28.080 --> 35:31.840
What our Britishness does is it brings us together because when you're in a

35:31.840 --> 35:34.840
multicultural community where some of our children are Muslim, some of them are

35:34.840 --> 35:37.880
Hindus, some of them are Sikhs, some of them are Christian.

35:38.080 --> 35:42.000
We've got children from Eastern Europe from and when I say from, you know,

35:42.000 --> 35:45.920
they tend to be second generation, but their grandparents and sometimes their

35:45.920 --> 35:51.800
parents are from India, from Nigeria, from Ghana, from Jamaica, from all over the Caribbean.

35:52.040 --> 35:56.280
You know, the fact is that when you have all of that difference,

35:56.400 --> 35:58.440
you need something to hold you together.

35:58.600 --> 36:02.240
That's what makes a country and that's what makes a country successful.

36:02.440 --> 36:05.320
It's what helps to make our schools successful, because we're all bound

36:05.320 --> 36:10.440
together by these, by the hymns that we sing, by the poetry that we recite,

36:10.640 --> 36:15.800
by the history that we learn, which is our history, as opposed to feeling so

36:15.800 --> 36:18.880
uncomfortable about it. Now, that doesn't mean we don't tell them the truth.

36:19.040 --> 36:23.760
You know, we don't not teach them about the Atlantic slave trade.

36:23.880 --> 36:28.000
We don't. We teach all the good things and the bad things that happen.

36:28.200 --> 36:30.960
This is one that comes up all the time in the de-statuary movement.

36:31.200 --> 36:33.640
Yeah, horrendous, Britain kept slave for 200 years.

36:33.760 --> 36:37.320
It was the first empire, the first culture I've, and I'm a bit of a student

36:37.320 --> 36:39.520
of history, that actually abolished it. Yes.

36:39.560 --> 36:43.320
And inconveniently, of course, the people who abolished it were extraordinarily

36:43.320 --> 36:48.440
privileged, wealthy, white, largely male and often Christian.

36:48.680 --> 36:53.320
Yes. Yes. The very people who are now supposedly responsible for all the evils in the world.

36:53.360 --> 36:54.080
Yes, that's right.

36:54.080 --> 36:58.480
So when they sent out the British Navy to stop other people trading in human

36:58.480 --> 37:00.320
misery, yes, and where's the credit for them?

37:00.480 --> 37:03.320
Well, those sailors who died in the Royal Navy, racist.

37:03.320 --> 37:07.560
Yes. So no, but you see what I'm driving at.

37:07.800 --> 37:10.800
So you've got to teach the good with the bad and the bad with the good.

37:10.800 --> 37:11.440
Exactly.

37:11.440 --> 37:12.240
If you're going to learn.

37:12.240 --> 37:16.320
The point is, you need to just teach the facts, you know, so they'll learn that.

37:16.320 --> 37:17.760
So they'll know what the facts are.

37:17.800 --> 37:20.760
Yes, they'll also understand that slavery was was common.

37:21.000 --> 37:24.200
This wasn't just a white on black thing.

37:24.400 --> 37:27.240
The triangle where they went to the West Coast of Africa,

37:27.800 --> 37:32.200
they purchased slaves from blacks who had gone inland, killed off the ones that

37:32.200 --> 37:36.920
couldn't work, that had no value, very cool and bought the rest back to the coast to sell them.

37:36.920 --> 37:38.080
Yes, exactly.

37:38.080 --> 37:39.760
You know, every culture was involved in this.

37:39.760 --> 37:40.560
Yes.

37:40.560 --> 37:43.800
As Macron said in France, there was a very interesting point on paraphrasing.

37:44.520 --> 37:47.040
By all means, criticize your culture, but know what it is first.

37:47.200 --> 37:54.000
Yes. Yes. Although it is also true that a lot of the, you know, what made Britain

37:54.040 --> 37:59.200
rich came from that slave trade and that's something that we all need to be

37:59.200 --> 38:01.360
aware of and accept and that's fine.

38:01.360 --> 38:05.000
I mean, but then the British people were courageous enough to say, we're going to stop it.

38:05.000 --> 38:06.800
And that impact despite the wealth.

38:06.800 --> 38:07.320
Yes. Yeah.

38:07.320 --> 38:11.400
But it had a negative impact on British wealth for many decades.

38:11.400 --> 38:17.400
The economists will tell you so they willingly took on a lowering in their standard of living

38:17.400 --> 38:20.360
and in their wealth to achieve this great social end.

38:20.360 --> 38:22.040
That's we ought to know about that.

38:22.280 --> 38:24.560
Are we prepared to make those sort of sacrifices?

38:24.560 --> 38:26.240
Yes. Well, I don't know.

38:26.240 --> 38:29.840
I'm on people these days don't make any sacrifices for all kinds of levels.

38:30.280 --> 38:35.760
Well, I'm guessing some of your kids would be prepared to entertain on what I sort of do, you know, it's true.

38:36.240 --> 38:39.360
Our children understand gratitude.

38:39.360 --> 38:41.760
We teach them gratitude.

38:41.760 --> 38:44.840
We teach them not just to be grateful to their teachers,

38:44.840 --> 38:48.760
but to be grateful to their parents and to their wider families for looking after them.

38:49.080 --> 38:57.000
And the thing is, is that however little you have, you will always have more than somebody else.

38:57.680 --> 39:00.240
And you need to be grateful for that.

39:00.240 --> 39:05.960
We teach them about being grateful for the fact that we all live in Britain, you know, like it's a great country.

39:06.840 --> 39:07.880
We have the rule of law.

39:07.880 --> 39:09.120
We have democracy.

39:09.120 --> 39:12.720
We have, you know, we can choose how we want to live.

39:12.720 --> 39:14.120
You can choose to be gay.

39:14.120 --> 39:18.560
You can choose to get married or not get married or do whatever it is you want.

39:18.560 --> 39:25.520
And nobody's going to hassle you for it, you know, it's it's a great thing to be able to live in a country like that.

39:25.520 --> 39:29.680
When you think there are so many countries out there where, well, if you're gay,

39:29.680 --> 39:38.440
they'll push you off the top of a building, you know, and it's just it's unfortunately these days.

39:38.440 --> 39:45.600
The the argument is very skewed and some of the law, you know, the loudest voices out there

39:46.600 --> 39:57.720
are only critical of some people, namely people in the West and often politicians,

39:57.720 --> 40:00.560
they might be critical of who have more of a conservative point of view.

40:00.560 --> 40:10.000
People like me, they're very critical of because I'm a traditionalist and I believe that, you know, I love my country.

40:10.000 --> 40:12.720
Looks like you've got plenty of parents who agree with you.

40:12.720 --> 40:14.840
Yes, they're curing up to get in.

40:14.960 --> 40:17.440
Yes, that's true, although I have to say we are in the inner city.

40:17.440 --> 40:22.240
So I think a lot of them don't necessarily understand all of those kinds of details.

40:22.240 --> 40:25.520
They might just hear it's a good school, so they want to send their child here.

40:25.520 --> 40:30.080
I think some of them will just be because they're living next door and they send their child to the school next door.

40:30.080 --> 40:38.200
You know, not all families, of course, are are engaged with their child's education and because this is the inner city.

40:38.200 --> 40:43.000
That's the other thing to remember is that these children in the inner city, too many of them,

40:43.040 --> 40:45.680
do not have parents who are super engaged.

40:45.680 --> 40:51.320
And so if you, as a school, don't scaffold them and support them, they haven't got anybody.

40:51.320 --> 40:56.080
Well, this is, yeah, but you've recently said that our obsessive resolve to talk about racism,

40:56.080 --> 41:00.320
which is endemic across the West, all a lot of people want to talk about.

41:00.320 --> 41:06.080
You know, you're the critical theorist who say it is the problem in the world today.

41:06.080 --> 41:11.960
And you said actually, and I'm quoting here, undermines the sense of self-worth that children can have in themselves,

41:11.960 --> 41:16.720
that they desperately need to be able to change their stars and make something better of themselves.

41:16.720 --> 41:22.880
Yeah, well, the idea there is that if you are stoking this sense of victim in the child,

41:22.880 --> 41:27.840
and if you're telling him that the establishment is against him because of his color of the color of his skin,

41:27.840 --> 41:34.160
it could be because of his sexuality, it could be that you're telling all the girls that, you know, the patriarchy is going to get them.

41:34.160 --> 41:40.040
And whatever the reason is, if you're telling them that the establishment is against them,

41:40.120 --> 41:42.320
then why would they work for it?

41:42.320 --> 41:44.160
They'll just give up, you know.

41:44.160 --> 41:47.880
There needs to be a sense of, look, there are obstacles out there.

41:47.880 --> 41:49.200
You're going to have to jump over them.

41:49.200 --> 41:51.360
So I don't tell them that there aren't any obstacles.

41:51.360 --> 41:52.920
I certainly don't talk about the details.

41:52.920 --> 41:54.920
I don't say there is racism, there is sexism.

41:54.920 --> 42:00.600
I don't talk about that at all because I know they get enough of that out in the social media world and from everyone else.

42:00.600 --> 42:02.040
So I don't talk about that.

42:02.040 --> 42:03.960
I just say there are obstacles.

42:03.960 --> 42:04.920
And what are you going to do?

42:04.920 --> 42:09.920
Sit down and just think, well, I'm done for, or are you going to pick yourself up but going to keep going?

42:09.920 --> 42:14.280
You're going to get those GCSEs, you're going to get those A-levels and you're going to get the best place that you can possibly get to.

42:14.280 --> 42:16.240
That is the attitude that you need to have.

42:16.240 --> 42:20.240
When I was told I couldn't open the school, when I had people protesting outside,

42:20.240 --> 42:22.120
we tried to open in three different places.

42:22.120 --> 42:25.600
First we tried in Lambeth, they managed to stop us there.

42:25.600 --> 42:28.280
Then we tried in Wandsworth, they stopped us there.

42:28.280 --> 42:30.760
Then we came to Brent, it took us three and a half years.

42:30.760 --> 42:34.920
Did I at any point sit down and think, oh well, I just can't do this, I'm a victim?

42:34.920 --> 42:38.400
Or did I think, no, pick myself up each time and I kept on going?

42:38.400 --> 42:40.240
And that is what I keep telling my kids.

42:40.240 --> 42:44.520
And that is why they are hugely resilient and hugely successful, not the only reason.

42:44.520 --> 42:49.240
I mean, obviously they also have a great education in terms of the teachers that they have here or the subjects they learn,

42:49.240 --> 42:50.720
the skills they learn and so on.

42:50.720 --> 42:52.400
Heroes are important.

42:52.400 --> 42:58.280
But exactly, and they need to hear that sense of purpose and drive.

42:58.280 --> 43:01.000
And that when you're knocked down, you pick yourself up.

43:01.000 --> 43:06.720
But if on the other hand as a teacher, you indulge in that conversation around,

43:06.720 --> 43:11.680
woe is me, life is so difficult because my father was an alcoholic or whatever it is,

43:11.680 --> 43:13.120
you're never going to get anywhere.

43:13.120 --> 43:15.880
And maybe life is more difficult for you.

43:15.880 --> 43:16.640
Maybe it's not.

43:16.640 --> 43:18.160
I'm not even getting into that conversation.

43:18.160 --> 43:19.280
I actually don't care.

43:19.280 --> 43:20.280
Who cares?

43:20.280 --> 43:22.040
Yes, maybe somebody was racist towards you.

43:22.040 --> 43:23.520
You're going to let that ruin your life?

43:23.520 --> 43:27.560
Pick yourself up and keep going.

43:27.560 --> 43:30.000
There's a lot of talk, and you and I have talked about this before,

43:30.000 --> 43:32.880
about the effect that technology is having on children.

43:32.880 --> 43:36.040
The internet and iPhones in particular.

43:36.080 --> 43:39.240
You actually wrote an article about it, though, since we talked about it,

43:39.240 --> 43:44.520
I think, called Digital Detox at your school.

43:44.520 --> 43:45.920
What's digital detox?

43:45.920 --> 43:47.600
Yeah, we have this whole digital detox system.

43:47.600 --> 43:52.520
So I bought this massive safe and the kids are strongly encouraged

43:52.520 --> 43:55.920
to give us their phones and their devices.

43:55.920 --> 43:58.360
And we put them in the safe.

43:58.360 --> 43:59.880
They can give it to us for one night.

43:59.880 --> 44:01.560
They can give it to us from Monday to Friday.

44:01.560 --> 44:02.720
They can give it to us for the weekend.

44:02.720 --> 44:03.320
It's up to them.

44:03.320 --> 44:04.880
It's entirely voluntary.

44:04.880 --> 44:10.920
And then we keep their phones and we help them sort of break the addiction,

44:10.920 --> 44:11.560
as it were.

44:11.560 --> 44:12.280
Addiction?

44:12.280 --> 44:14.560
Yes, it is definitely an addiction.

44:14.560 --> 44:18.240
Some of them don't have phones at all because before they arrive at the school,

44:18.240 --> 44:21.520
I speak to every single parent and I say to them,

44:21.520 --> 44:25.440
my advice is do not buy your child a smartphone before they come to secondary school

44:25.440 --> 44:27.720
because that's often the time, just when they start secondary school,

44:27.720 --> 44:29.800
that their parent gives them a smartphone.

44:29.800 --> 44:33.120
We sell brick phones here to the parents at a loss.

44:33.120 --> 44:34.240
So we buy them for 14.

44:34.240 --> 44:38.960
We sell them at 10 so that you can still text, you can still ring them.

44:38.960 --> 44:41.400
You have the convenience of staying in touch with your child,

44:41.400 --> 44:45.680
but they do not have unsupervised access to the internet because that is so dangerous,

44:45.680 --> 44:47.240
whether on a phone or on a laptop.

44:47.240 --> 44:49.960
But the point about a laptop is that you'll be there with them at home.

44:49.960 --> 44:51.800
You can watch them with the phone.

44:51.800 --> 44:52.800
They're out and about on the street.

44:52.800 --> 44:54.360
You have no idea who they're meeting.

44:54.360 --> 44:57.920
Meeting people in gangs, girls meeting older men,

44:57.920 --> 45:03.080
boys meeting all sorts of horrible people who you wouldn't want your boy mixing with.

45:03.200 --> 45:10.000
I mean, honestly, it is a genuine danger for children to be given unsupervised access to the internet.

45:10.000 --> 45:12.360
And parents don't realise.

45:12.360 --> 45:13.360
They don't realise.

45:14.480 --> 45:15.480
Take the point.

45:16.720 --> 45:17.600
Funding.

45:17.600 --> 45:23.680
In Australia, we have almost doubled the per capita funding for children,

45:23.680 --> 45:25.720
broadly speaking, particularly in the state system.

45:25.720 --> 45:27.880
And every expert who wants to talk about it says,

45:27.880 --> 45:30.920
we've got to resource our schools better and if governments don't, they fail.

45:30.920 --> 45:32.760
But our academic standards,

45:32.760 --> 45:34.320
I mean, you cannot get away from the numbers.

45:34.320 --> 45:36.360
They continue to decline.

45:36.360 --> 45:41.560
Anxiety, depression and self-harm levels continue to rise.

45:41.560 --> 45:44.680
The extra money doesn't seem to be the solution.

45:44.680 --> 45:46.680
I'm not saying they shouldn't be well resourced,

45:46.680 --> 45:49.440
but it doesn't seem to be the key ingredient.

45:49.440 --> 45:51.200
Well, Jonathan Haight, an American,

45:51.200 --> 45:55.720
he's done a great job of tracking this sort of thing with children

45:55.720 --> 45:58.520
that anxiety and depression levels have risen massively

45:58.520 --> 46:00.280
since the introduction of the smartphones.

46:00.280 --> 46:01.760
The very thing you were talking about when I went to go.

46:01.760 --> 46:05.120
Like, and then your child's mental health falls apart

46:05.120 --> 46:07.560
and you don't know why and it's because you gave them a smartphone.

46:07.560 --> 46:10.440
And you know, I'm ringing the alarm bells for parents.

46:10.440 --> 46:12.760
So all I can say is do not give them a smartphone.

46:12.760 --> 46:14.680
And I know it's hard because they'll say,

46:14.680 --> 46:16.800
but I'm being left out of conversations.

46:16.800 --> 46:17.720
I need to be in there.

46:17.720 --> 46:20.160
You just need to love your child enough to hold the line.

46:22.600 --> 46:25.320
Yeah, so what was the beginning of what you were saying?

46:25.320 --> 46:29.240
Oh, funding, you know, we've increased funding hugely,

46:29.240 --> 46:31.480
but it's done nothing to arrest declining standards.

46:31.840 --> 46:34.200
And increased problems of anxiety.

46:34.200 --> 46:35.200
So I'm ahead.

46:35.200 --> 46:36.280
I'm principal of the school.

46:36.280 --> 46:38.960
I'll always take more money if they're going to give it to me.

46:40.040 --> 46:42.480
And of course, money will make things better in some ways.

46:42.920 --> 46:47.200
But we always make the mistake of thinking that more money will

46:48.400 --> 46:50.680
is how you fix the problem.

46:50.680 --> 46:54.280
And you've got to think, well, why is the problem a problem?

46:54.560 --> 46:56.680
Maybe it's because of a bad idea.

46:56.680 --> 46:59.200
Maybe it's because we're doing more of what we've always done.

47:00.160 --> 47:02.480
Maybe there's something wrong with the teacher training.

47:02.480 --> 47:04.200
Maybe there's something wrong with the discipline.

47:04.200 --> 47:06.920
Maybe there's something wrong with our expectations of the children.

47:07.280 --> 47:10.520
And then we need to go around other schools and see,

47:10.600 --> 47:12.320
well, what are they doing differently?

47:12.320 --> 47:15.240
How can I take an idea from here and from over there and so on

47:15.480 --> 47:18.640
to make where I am better, even though I might not have much money?

47:18.880 --> 47:22.800
That is, yeah, that's how we all need to think.

47:22.800 --> 47:26.600
But it's much easier to just say, oh, it's because we don't have the funds.

47:27.600 --> 47:31.000
I'd say it's because too often we have bad ideas.

47:32.160 --> 47:35.000
Well, I know in our country, I don't like left, right, right divides,

47:35.000 --> 47:40.160
but it is true that the progressive sort of elements in society,

47:40.160 --> 47:43.760
particularly in politics, talk a lot more about education, I think, than others.

47:44.520 --> 47:49.840
And yet so often it's just a demand more money

47:50.320 --> 47:52.440
or different working conditions for teachers.

47:52.440 --> 47:54.040
And I have the utmost respect for teachers.

47:54.040 --> 47:55.080
That's not the issue.

47:55.080 --> 47:59.800
The focus is not on what is going to help the children prepare for life.

47:59.800 --> 48:00.800
Yeah.

48:00.800 --> 48:05.000
Well, and I think part of that is because they assume everybody's sort of doing

48:05.000 --> 48:06.000
the right things already.

48:07.840 --> 48:10.040
And that's where some humility needs to come.

48:10.560 --> 48:16.040
We need to start questioning what we've always done and look to others.

48:16.040 --> 48:18.880
So most of the stuff that you see happening here at our school,

48:19.080 --> 48:20.680
we've just taken from somewhere else.

48:20.680 --> 48:23.800
Right? I've been to visit a school and I thought, that's a great idea.

48:23.800 --> 48:24.800
Let's use that.

48:25.200 --> 48:26.800
I've been to another school. That's a great idea.

48:26.800 --> 48:27.800
Let's use that.

48:27.800 --> 48:32.800
And so we have adapted and changed so much in order to make sure that the offer

48:32.800 --> 48:36.360
that we're giving our children is of the highest possible quality.

48:37.680 --> 48:43.600
I think too often schools are just sort of considered the place where children go

48:43.920 --> 48:48.920
and they do they get babysat and they learn something and it's all right.

48:48.920 --> 48:51.280
And there's some kids who are more driven than others.

48:51.520 --> 48:53.600
And that's just how it is.

48:53.840 --> 48:55.560
And it can be so much better than that.

48:55.560 --> 48:58.680
Isn't there an issue here that I would have thought in this country,

48:58.680 --> 49:02.960
I know in ours, education is incredibly important to people who have been successful

49:02.960 --> 49:08.400
in life. They will push their kids to the nth degree and they will demand an awful

49:08.400 --> 49:11.160
lot from their schools. So you get that at one level.

49:11.720 --> 49:14.680
But then there are the taboo subjects that people won't talk about

49:16.480 --> 49:19.720
when it comes to children doing well.

49:19.760 --> 49:23.880
For example, the home environment is a great predictor of how well prepared

49:23.880 --> 49:27.680
the kid will be when they enter school and then how well they'll do through.

49:27.960 --> 49:29.680
Yes. And that's true.

49:29.680 --> 49:33.600
But a lot of people are not comfortable saying to parents,

49:34.040 --> 49:35.880
you know, if you're going to bring kids into the world,

49:36.200 --> 49:38.440
you shouldn't bring them into a dysfunctional environment.

49:38.560 --> 49:41.640
Yeah. Well, I mean, obviously, I think.

49:41.640 --> 49:43.640
But we don't talk about it.

49:43.640 --> 49:45.000
No, no one does.

49:45.000 --> 49:48.080
And politicians don't because there's nothing in it for them.

49:48.080 --> 49:50.920
Why would they go and criticize families, you know, when they want their votes?

49:51.240 --> 49:55.320
So I mean, it's not just don't bring them into dysfunctional environments.

49:55.320 --> 49:58.720
It's when you have a child, how are you going to invest in them?

49:58.840 --> 50:00.880
How are you going to make sure that you are teaching them?

50:01.240 --> 50:03.760
Whenever I say this on Twitter about teaching your own child,

50:04.000 --> 50:06.440
so many people say to me, I'm not teaching my child.

50:06.440 --> 50:08.400
That's the job of schools. Yeah.

50:08.400 --> 50:11.840
And I always think, well, OK, then your child isn't going to do that.

50:11.840 --> 50:14.920
Well, it's cool because I can tell you that at five years old,

50:15.080 --> 50:17.520
there are some children who start school already reading.

50:17.520 --> 50:19.840
Yeah. And there are some children who have no idea to read.

50:20.120 --> 50:22.840
Now, you can say that the school is going to teach my child.

50:22.960 --> 50:26.160
Well, I can tell you for nothing, the ones who already know how to read

50:26.280 --> 50:30.440
are at a massive headstock and then they are reading even faster and better

50:30.440 --> 50:32.760
and longer books and harder books and so on.

50:33.000 --> 50:35.760
And when they're then 12 and they're still reading

50:35.880 --> 50:38.920
and they're reading books for 15 year olds and so on,

50:39.080 --> 50:42.040
and you look at them and go, gosh, it's amazing.

50:42.240 --> 50:44.200
My child never took to reading like that.

50:44.200 --> 50:46.560
What was because you never taught them? That's why.

50:46.600 --> 50:51.040
Now, when I say teach, I don't mean stand up at home with a blackboard,

50:51.200 --> 50:53.000
you know, teaching them algebra.

50:53.000 --> 50:55.600
I mean, teach them everything, spend loads of time with them,

50:55.600 --> 50:57.800
talk to them loads, read to them loads,

50:57.920 --> 51:00.040
draw your finger under the words as you're reading to them.

51:00.240 --> 51:02.480
Don't just read them one story before they go to bed.

51:02.640 --> 51:04.960
Spend 20, 30 minutes reading to them.

51:06.520 --> 51:08.960
Get them to a point where they eventually can read on their own.

51:10.000 --> 51:15.400
Do get go to the shop and buy some phonics support and teach them phonics.

51:15.760 --> 51:20.320
You can teach them how to read long before they go to school at five.

51:20.680 --> 51:23.480
And then when they're at school,

51:23.520 --> 51:26.560
support the school by making sure you're not just doing the homework,

51:26.560 --> 51:28.200
you're doing more than what they're asking.

51:28.400 --> 51:31.760
You're counting the peas on the plate, you're counting the cars on the street.

51:31.920 --> 51:34.480
Once they know how to count, you know, let's say to 50,

51:34.480 --> 51:36.960
you're then counting by twos, you're then counting by threes.

51:37.200 --> 51:40.960
And over a period of years, you learn how to count by threes, fours, five, sixes.

51:41.120 --> 51:42.280
And hey, presto, guess what?

51:42.280 --> 51:45.720
When you're doing their multiplication tables, suddenly it's really easy.

51:45.840 --> 51:49.280
Isn't it funny how that boy just picked up those times tables like that?

51:49.520 --> 51:52.840
Well, that's because he had a mom who was counting with him by twos,

51:52.840 --> 51:54.720
threes and fours when he was little.

51:54.720 --> 51:56.360
And people don't think like that.

51:56.360 --> 51:58.840
They just sort of think, well, he just has a knack for maths.

51:59.000 --> 52:02.000
No, his mom helped him have that knack for maths.

52:02.600 --> 52:06.480
And those years, zero to five, long before they ever get to school,

52:06.600 --> 52:10.360
they are so crucial in determining a child's future.

52:10.600 --> 52:12.680
So a family is so important.

52:12.880 --> 52:17.040
But then my thing is the schools need to be excellent because, sadly,

52:17.040 --> 52:19.440
not all children get that kind of support at home.

52:19.640 --> 52:23.360
So we try to make up for some of that as much as we can here at McKayla.

52:24.080 --> 52:26.160
Don't want to disrupt perfection.

52:26.160 --> 52:28.760
I mean, we can't finish on a better note than that.

52:29.400 --> 52:31.760
What you've had to say has been of such interest.

52:32.320 --> 52:34.560
And I think it's so incredibly important.

52:34.880 --> 52:38.520
I only wish there were a whole lot more people with your drive and determination.

52:38.720 --> 52:41.840
Thank you in your country and in mine.

52:42.080 --> 52:43.880
There are lots, but we need more.

52:43.880 --> 52:44.840
Yes. Thank you.

52:44.840 --> 52:46.320
Thank you. Thanks for having me.
