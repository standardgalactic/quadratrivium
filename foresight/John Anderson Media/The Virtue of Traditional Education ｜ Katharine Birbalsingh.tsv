0	6400	They need to hear that sense of purpose and drive, and that when you're knocked down,
6400	7720	you pick yourself up.
7720	13560	But if on the other hand as a teacher, you indulge in that conversation around, whoa
13560	18480	is me, life is so difficult because my father was an alcoholic or whatever it is, you're
18480	19960	never going to get anywhere.
19960	22840	And maybe life is more difficult for you.
22840	23840	Maybe it's not.
23840	24840	I'm not even getting into that conversation.
24840	25840	I actually don't care.
25840	26840	Who cares?
26840	28680	Yes, maybe somebody was racist towards you.
28680	30320	You're going to let that ruin your life?
30320	44400	Pick yourself up and keep going.
44400	50560	Catherine Berbelsingh is the co-founder and head teacher at Macaela Community School in
50560	52880	Inner London.
52880	59560	After graduating from Oxford, Catherine became a school teacher and rose to prominence when
59560	66280	she gave a speech in 2010 criticising the impact of progressive educational ideas on children's
66280	68840	learning outcomes.
68840	74000	Finding herself without a job anymore because of that very speech, Catherine set about co-founding
74000	78840	her own school and I'm at it now.
78840	83960	It's based explicitly on more traditional educational techniques and social virtues such
83960	88000	as gratitude and personal responsibility.
88000	94720	Since 2010, Catherine has become one of the world's most prominent voices on education
94720	99960	reform and has hundreds of people, including from Australia, visiting her school every
99960	104240	year to take back lessons to apply in their own schools.
104240	111720	She's written and edited four books, including the latest, Macaela, The Power of Culture,
111720	118640	and in 2021 she was appointed chair of the Social Mobility Commission here in the UK.
118640	123600	I have to say, having had the privilege of spending some time at the school and sitting
123600	132000	in on some classes, hearing kids enthusiastically engage, sitting up respectfully, teachers
132000	140440	throwing extraordinary energy into it, discipline, tidiness, focus, you couldn't make this up.
140440	145520	So I start from a place of being quite amazed by what I've seen.
145520	151440	But Catherine, if I could start, you grew up in Canada, in England, you've travelled
151440	156640	the world, you studied French and philosophy at Oxford, and then you went to teach in state
156640	157640	schools.
157640	159000	Have you always wanted to be a teacher?
159000	160880	Is that your great passion in life?
160880	166080	No, I don't think I knew what I wanted to do at Oxford, but then I joined this group
166080	173000	which was about sending students from Oxford into the inner city to talk to young people
173000	178880	in schools about perhaps applying to Oxford or Cambridge.
178880	183920	And the idea was to send students who looked like them, came from their kind of backgrounds,
183920	185300	that kind of thing.
185300	189440	So I would go and I would talk to these kids, and at the beginning they'd say, I'm not
189480	192480	applying to Oxford or Cambridge, just a bunch of snobs, etc.
192480	196480	And by the end of me talking to them, I found that I'd changed some of their minds.
196480	201600	And I thought, oh, well this is really nice, I like this, and I like children, I love children.
201600	203800	And so I chose that as my career.
203800	208720	It was astonishing in some of those classrooms, you can tell the kids that they are really
208720	212040	diverse in every way, I suspect.
212040	216400	Everything from the home environment they've experienced as kids, right through to their
216480	222120	religious practices at home, or none, through to their diets, the whole bit.
222120	229400	But they're all sitting there, attentively getting on with it, as I say, you couldn't
229400	230400	make it up.
230400	235760	But you attracted a lot of attention from the media and your then colleagues, when
235760	241720	you gave a speech at the Conservative Party Conference in 2010, decrying what you called
242200	246600	the culture of excuses in the English education system.
246600	250160	What did you mean by culture of excuses?
250160	253640	Yeah, well, I don't think that you say the English education system, of course I was
253640	259240	speaking about that, but I think you find this all over the place, in Australia, for
259240	264280	instance, I've seen it there myself first hand, having visited some of your schools.
264280	269440	And I think that this is particularly the case for children from poor backgrounds,
269480	272080	from ethnic backgrounds.
272080	276640	In particular, I saw it in Australia when teachers were talking about Aboriginal children.
276640	282280	And it's just low expectations for these children and imagining that they can't really
282280	284520	amount very much.
284520	289640	And, well, he doesn't have a dad at home, so we're not going to expect him to do his
289640	295960	homework, or he lives on that council estate, or he's just from a poor background.
295960	301920	And so it's a bit much to expect him to turn up on time or to have his uniform on or whatever
301920	306160	it is the standards are, you drop them because you feel bad for them.
306160	311160	So it comes from a nice place, you know, these people are being compassionate, but what they
311160	315520	don't understand is that their compassion is killing the child.
315520	321440	And I saw a lot of that in Australia, sadly, in particular, directed towards Aboriginal
321440	322440	children.
322440	328240	I mean, I remember one teacher in one school saying to me that, well, at the end of the
328240	330640	day, these children are going to end up in prison.
330640	334840	So you just have some fun with them while you can before they end up in prison.
334840	339160	And I thought, but if we taught them properly, then maybe they wouldn't end up in prison,
339160	340160	you know.
340160	345520	You know, in one school, I saw them, they were doing a lot of guitar playing.
345520	347920	Well, the children weren't playing guitar.
347920	351120	The teacher was playing guitar, and they were all sort of singing together.
351120	354520	And I don't have anything against singing, but we did this for a very long time.
354520	358960	And I was saying, are there any maths lessons, any English lessons, you know?
358960	360200	And there was none of that.
360200	366880	And I think that sometimes teachers can look at children who come from different backgrounds
366880	367880	to their own.
367880	371640	And this isn't just a race issue, it can also be a socioeconomic issue.
371640	377720	And they sort of other the child, and they see them as so different, and they feel bad
377720	382760	about their own privilege that they've come from a home with two parents or whatever it
382760	383760	is.
383760	387760	And then they feel bad about sort of expecting more from that child.
387760	392440	And in the end, they let that child down because what I always say, if we give a child a detention
392440	396200	for not doing his homework, and people say, well, that's really cruel, I always say, you
396200	400880	know what's cruel is spending your life being functionally illiterate and functionally enumerate.
400880	402040	That's cruel.
402040	407680	And it's really about understanding that if you keep your standards high for them now,
407680	410800	they're going to be able to succeed later.
410800	415440	I just, I don't understand why everyone doesn't see this, but that that that's
415440	417800	I'm absolutely with you.
417800	426360	Why progressives in Australia cannot understand that that that that paternalism that that
426360	433280	sort of soft racism of low expectations, yeah, that's what it is flies in the face of everything
433280	435760	they say they believe in.
435760	442640	I know it's because in the moment of making the decision of holding the line, giving the
442640	447520	detention, ringing the parent, whatever it is, it feels bad.
447520	449880	It makes you feel like you're being mean.
449880	455360	And either you love them enough and follow through, and you love them enough to hold
455360	461680	them to those high standards, or you actually quite love yourself and the way you feel in
461680	462960	that moment.
462960	471680	And you you allow that to trump the desire, the long term desire for the child to succeed.
471680	473240	That's what's going on there.
473240	478200	And people need to sort of be honest with themselves and just think, well, am I actually
478200	483160	dropping my standards for some of these children and and not do it really?
483160	485520	You know, you just got to force yourself.
485520	487080	And and that's what we do here.
487080	489960	We have the same standards for everybody, whatever your background.
490400	495160	So Catherine, as I walk around the school and I say endless photographs of people like
495160	499800	the now Prime Minister Boris Johnson here, members of the Royal Family, of outstanding
499800	503440	sports people, of other educators praising what you do here.
503440	508040	I do notice one interesting one from a man who happens to be an African American just
508040	511920	on the wall here, where you're saying if you really want to serve someone else's interests,
511920	512920	you'll tell them the truth.
512920	513920	Yes.
513920	516680	If you just want to serve your own, you'll tell them what they want to hear.
516680	519480	It's a pretty important philosophy for a teacher, isn't it?
519680	521520	What's really going to serve the child?
521520	523600	Yes, exactly.
523880	533640	So we all know the school where we feel bad about marking them down on their work because
533640	534840	they made a good effort.
535080	540360	And so you give them the A and you tell them it was great, even though it really isn't very good.
540680	542560	But then what happens in the end?
542560	544000	The child thinks he's doing really well.
544000	547600	And then in the end, he fails all these exams and he thinks, well, why am I failing?
547600	549000	You told me I was doing really well.
549280	554960	I mean, for years in this country, we had a whole system of national assessment where
554960	557240	we would give these national assessment grades every year.
557400	559240	They were utterly incomprehensible to everybody.
559240	561960	I mean, parents couldn't understand them, teachers couldn't understand them.
562120	567800	And we all just, it was one A, one B, one C, one A, two A, two B, two C.
567960	569360	And we just used to make it up.
569360	571600	I mean, you would go in there and you think, well, I gave him a two B last time.
571600	572960	I'm talking about two C this time.
572960	576160	I mean, you were just, you were honestly, it was so ridiculous.
579640	587080	Schools can be what everyone needs when it comes to schooling is there
587080	588360	needs to be a goal.
589240	591200	It's not just something that you do.
591200	592880	That's what I find that people think.
593240	597160	You send your child to school and they go and they come home.
597440	601400	You know, so often when I've said to journalists, you don't understand.
601600	603280	Schools are failing our children.
603560	606600	And every single one of them will say to me, but our schools are fine.
606760	607680	What do you mean?
607720	609520	My child's okay and he's at school.
610000	611240	And I say, how do you know?
611960	614920	And they'll say, well, he's okay.
614920	616480	I say, but he comes home from school.
617440	618640	You ask him, how was your day?
618840	620280	He says, fine.
620800	621520	He goes to his room.
622120	624280	Well, how do you know?
624640	626240	You don't know what's going on in his classroom.
626520	628000	You don't know the quality of the teaching.
628000	630400	You don't know the quality of the questioning, the quality of the explanations,
630400	631200	the quality of the homework.
631200	633480	Does the homework actually match what they were doing in the lesson in the first
633480	636200	place? Is it drilling them in the right things that they need to know?
636400	638800	Is it like, you have no idea.
639000	640760	Is it stretching them where they need to be stretched?
640960	644120	Is it encouraging independent thought in this kind of way, but making sure that
644120	645640	the basis is covered in another kind of way?
645840	649360	Like there's so I could go on for hours about the details of what makes a good
649360	651000	teacher and what makes for good teaching.
652000	655320	Too often people think that teaching is just something you do when you couldn't
655320	661080	do something else, when actually it is, you know, a game for only the super
661080	662320	talented, right?
662600	670600	Well, I couldn't believe the energy and the drive and the engagement with their
670600	673840	students that I saw amongst five or six of your teachers today.
673840	675080	It was astonishing.
675360	679600	They must be utterly worn out of the end of the term, let alone the end,
679800	681080	you know, probably the end of the day.
681360	687680	Well, that's a really interesting point because I would say, and I know this
687680	692000	from talking to my teachers, they are less worn out here than they were at
692000	692840	their other schools.
693040	693720	Fascinating.
693840	696760	And it's true that they're giving their heart and soul and they absolutely
696760	698320	love it and they love the kids and so on.
698760	703280	But they're also not having to deal with rudeness, chat back to them, you
703280	708640	know, kids marching out of lessons, them having to bring irate parents, dealing
708640	711600	with that, there's none of that kind of friction.
711880	714440	So emotionally, it's a lot less draining.
715000	720560	It's true that they give a lot, but they do, they're not as drained as they,
721280	722360	as they were at their other schools.
722800	724480	But teaching is tiring.
724640	725360	It's very tiring.
725360	728920	I have the, you know, whether it's because of the disciplinary problems,
728920	731920	which I don't blame the teachers for, you know, some of them are to blame,
731920	735720	but not a lot, most of them are not, whether it's the expectations, the
735720	737280	report writing and so forth put on them.
737600	741560	I fully accept it is a very demanding profession and one that ought to be
742000	744480	better recognized in every way by the community.
744800	749120	But, but now back to, so you gave that speech, you know, you, you dared to talk
749120	753520	about some culture of excesses, and suddenly you're out on your ear.
753520	754840	No one wants to employ you.
755000	755480	Yes.
755880	760280	It was quite a struggle to start the school, I don't imagine, to find people
760280	762400	who'd support you, the local government authorities.
762400	766400	So this is again, this problem of who's thinking of the kids' real interests?
766440	766880	Yes.
767240	767640	Yeah.
767760	772560	Well, unfortunately, education is real political football at the time.
772560	775440	The Conservative Party were the ones that introduced this idea of free schools.
776440	780200	I decided that I needed to set up my own school because I just couldn't get back
780200	784040	into the state sector because they wouldn't have me because I'd done the
784040	786840	unthinkable and I'd spoken at the Conservative Party and that really is
786840	788960	just a no-no when it comes to education.
789520	792680	And not that anybody says that to you, but you just kind of know that that's
792680	793440	what's going on.
793600	794920	That's where our culture works now.
794920	796760	You know when you've been quietly cancelled.
796840	797440	Exactly.
797440	800040	And it's interesting because it was before council culture became a thing,
800040	803760	but I was one of the earlier cancellations as it were, you know.
803920	804960	That's very encouraging.
805080	806800	There might be people out there feeling cancelled.
806800	807600	You can survive it.
807800	812720	You can, but it's true that it takes an enormous amount of guts and determination.
812720	816200	So for three and a half years, I worked to be able to set up this school.
816400	823000	We had all kinds of detractors protesting, sending me horrible emails, death threats,
823000	824040	all kind of craziness.
824040	825960	I mean, like just you wouldn't believe it.
826120	831440	I kept saying, you'd think we were creating, you know, building nuclear bombs.
831440	835600	I mean, we were just trying to set up a school in the inner city to help
835600	837280	children who are deprived.
837360	838920	I mean, what is the problem?
839440	840640	But they really didn't like me.
840640	842560	One, because I'd spoken at the Conservative Party Conference.
842560	844160	Two, because of the things I was saying.
844400	848680	So I was saying that the system wasn't good enough and you're not allowed
848680	851560	to criticize education and I was doing it openly.
852160	856240	I still do it, you know, and that's because I think you criticize what you love.
856400	859800	You know, if you're not critical and if you don't hold the education system
859800	863360	to high standards, then we'll all just bob along being mediocre and we don't want that.
863760	866280	So we set up the school eventually.
866280	869040	But when I say there were protests, I mean, there were people when we had our first
869040	873360	year group, 120 year seven kids, so 11 year olds here.
874360	878640	There were people protesting outside, handing them leaflets, telling them their
878640	882560	lives were in danger in this building because it was a health and safety hazard.
882560	884240	I mean, can you imagine this building?
884520	886400	Yeah, it's one of the best school buildings I've seen.
886440	889600	Well, at the time we were doing refurbishments.
889600	892120	You had to walk through a kind of tunnel to get through.
892320	896320	And of course, all the self health and safety boxes had been ticked,
896640	899360	but they were just making up any nonsense.
900280	903400	Any form of storm in true Catherine fashion.
903720	907200	I saw a couple of these flyers that they were handing them.
907200	908320	So I took the flyer.
908320	911440	I photocopied it 120 times and I gave it to all the children.
911600	915160	And I said, when you go outside and see them, you can wave it in their faces
915160	918400	and you can say my headmistress has already given me a copy.
918400	919560	Well done. That was clever.
919960	920800	It was very clever.
920800	925200	I'll come to silencing the critics by the all performance in a moment.
925200	931760	But before I do, so you set up in 2014, you finally found a building,
931880	936920	a council that would support you, despite that opposition locally that you talked about.
937800	938960	But you said there's a very interesting.
938960	942600	It's anti progressivist in its philosophical origins.
943200	947520	What do you mean by progressivist educational philosophy?
947840	951280	And just as a matter of interest, how might parents identify it?
951280	954480	Because I think a lot of parents are confused about what's happening in schools.
954600	957280	Yeah, no, that's very true.
957280	960800	And I think, you know, a lot of our kids come here because we're in too many schools,
960800	962840	I should say, rather than blanket them all.
962840	964080	But in too many schools, yeah.
964080	965080	Yeah.
967160	972840	Well, actually, I'd probably say the vast majority of schools are too progressive.
973760	975160	There are very few.
975160	977280	Yes, absolutely.
977280	978560	There are very few schools.
978560	981080	You have to go against the zeitgeist.
981280	989000	You have to have made a firm decision to to throw out what everyone's telling you to do.
989200	992720	And there are a few heads out there who do that, but we are few and far between.
993280	997240	And so that's why I say the vast majority, because the teacher training institutions,
997400	1002400	the general culture in 2022 is one of progressivism.
1002560	1004760	So what do we mean by that?
1005040	1009160	Advice for the parents who are watching is when you go into the classrooms,
1009320	1013880	are the desks grouped together so that the children are facing each other?
1014000	1019080	So we're in a classroom right now here and the desks are facing the front of the classroom
1019280	1022440	and the teacher would be at the front, leading the learning.
1023000	1026000	In other progressive classrooms, the desks are grouped together.
1026280	1030560	And then the idea is the children are the ones leading the learning, not the teacher.
1030880	1034440	And then the teacher gives them a task which they get on with together.
1034840	1039280	So they're leading the learning together and the teacher might move amongst the desks,
1039560	1043280	keeping them on task, as opposed to the teacher being at the front,
1043280	1045840	being the figure of authority and leading that learning.
1046080	1047920	So that's one very obvious way to tell.
1048960	1051640	Then there's just the values stuff.
1051920	1056360	You know, when you read their website, do they talk about tradition?
1056640	1061520	Do they talk about valuing, having traditional values?
1062280	1064400	Or do they say we're very modern?
1064400	1066360	Do they talk a lot about technology?
1066680	1072320	Do they talk about, you know, children finding themselves?
1072320	1074080	That's the kind of thing that they might say.
1074360	1077200	Now, you think, well, why wouldn't you want a child to find themselves?
1077440	1078640	I'm not against that.
1078840	1081000	It's just that's the phrasing that they'll use.
1081000	1082120	That's where you look really, isn't it?
1082520	1088600	Yeah, so children finding themselves, children, you know, being who they want to be,
1088880	1092840	that kind of thing, as opposed to we're more of a traditional outfit
1092960	1097400	where we believe children need to acquire knowledge and skills to succeed at life.
1098000	1102040	And we are here to teach them and guide them and lead them
1102160	1103920	and look after them and love them.
1103920	1107200	You know, that that that's all under the traditional umbrella.
1107440	1112480	The progressive umbrella is children need to explore for themselves.
1112680	1118120	Children need to be free to express themselves
1118280	1120120	and to find who they are, as it were.
1120480	1124560	And the thing is, some viewers might listen to that and go, that sounds really great.
1125160	1128120	The problem with progressivism is that it's so seductive
1128360	1131440	because you listen to it and you think, that's what I want as an adult.
1131440	1132440	I want to be free.
1132440	1133880	I want to express myself.
1133880	1137640	I want to find who I am, and that's absolutely fine for an adult.
1138560	1142800	The thing is, is that children are not experts and children need guidance.
1143000	1147200	So when you take your four year old out to the road, you don't say, here's the road.
1147640	1150640	Go find yourself, because he'll get squashed by a car.
1151080	1156360	What you do is you hold his hand and you gradually teach him how to cross the road
1156640	1159440	until eventually he's able to do it on his own.
1160000	1161240	And that will take years.
1161240	1164920	It takes years to get a child to the point where he can cross the road on his own
1165160	1166480	because he has to look both ways.
1166480	1168600	He has to have a sense of when the car is going to stop.
1168840	1172120	He then needs to be able to get across the road in a quick and safe manner.
1172320	1176320	There are so many skills that are involved there in crossing the road.
1176760	1180200	And I have to say, most parents instinctively know not to just allow
1180200	1182240	their child to be free when it comes to crossing the road.
1182720	1185720	They don't necessarily know that when it comes to the classroom.
1185880	1187440	It's the same with anything.
1187560	1192000	You need children to be habituated and to be drilled in the basics
1192240	1194040	so that they could then build up from that.
1194120	1196280	And you scaffold them the whole time.
1196400	1200440	You're there as their parent or their teacher, constantly scaffolding,
1200600	1205480	helping them get to a point where, yes, they are then adults and they are free
1205640	1211000	to be able to succeed and fail and try again and fail again and so on.
1211360	1216360	But unless they've had that that traditional scaffolding and teaching
1216360	1219880	of knowledge and skills, if that hasn't happened properly
1220040	1223560	because they have been left to child-centered learning
1223560	1226880	where they are leading themselves, they simply won't know as much
1226880	1229240	as the child who's been in the more traditional classroom.
1229600	1234760	I must say, I was just I could not get over the bond between teacher and student.
1236200	1241240	All eyes on the teacher, the teacher engaging with enormous energy.
1241880	1244600	And I was looking for the kid who didn't put their hand up
1245320	1249520	when that was time to answer a question or maybe I couldn't find one.
1250520	1251840	I'm a bit. Well, there are some.
1251840	1254280	But yeah, I didn't find one today.
1254920	1257280	Just the dynamics of it were extraordinary.
1257640	1260440	So let's drill into this a bit more.
1260440	1262800	You've been going since 2014.
1262920	1265160	So you've got a bit of an idea of how it's working now.
1265440	1267160	Yeah. Is it silencing the critics?
1267160	1268800	What's it look like success?
1268800	1272280	Yeah, because it's about more than just academic results.
1272280	1274800	But my guess is the academic results are good.
1275200	1277720	What do you see about the students that have been right through now?
1278080	1280400	Yes. And is it silencing the critics?
1281040	1282960	Oh, many of them, it has science.
1283840	1286000	There were a whole bunch of people who were very vocal before
1286000	1288640	who were protesting outside and so on. We don't get protesters anymore.
1288880	1292360	So in that sense, it's been a huge success.
1292800	1296840	A lot of people who were on the fence, I find I have a lot of people
1296840	1299680	following me on Twitter and I find I'll go to a conference.
1299680	1302440	I'll be on the street and somebody will run up to me and say,
1303760	1306600	I can't say this out loud, but I just want you to know you have my support.
1308760	1310320	Be useful. I did say it out loud.
1310320	1312800	I know, but I don't I don't blame them. I get it.
1313000	1315960	So there are I have a lot of silence supporters
1316080	1318160	and silent followers who never say anything.
1318280	1321680	And I must always remind myself of this because sometimes I can get
1322520	1325160	distracted by the the vocal minorities.
1325160	1327360	I do think they are a vocal minority.
1327360	1331840	It's just that the minority have the power.
1332080	1333080	That's the thing.
1333080	1334760	They have the media outlets.
1334760	1338680	They have the politicians ears or they are actually the politicians.
1339640	1344080	And so those people are they just have so much power.
1344320	1348280	It's ordinary families who where they don't have any power at all,
1348440	1350400	who might be supportive, but they just can't say anything.
1351120	1353000	Families and then teachers, ordinary teachers,
1353120	1355640	we get over 600 visitors a year who come to the school.
1355800	1357080	Most of those are teachers.
1357080	1358880	Some of those are Australian teachers.
1359040	1362320	I have I've had Australian teachers writing to me who have never been here,
1362560	1365600	but saying because I've been on some Australian news bit.
1365600	1366920	And, you know, yes, you have.
1366920	1370600	So I'll I'll I'll be in the news and then I'll get we'll get a few emails
1370600	1371920	through to the website here.
1371920	1375280	They get on the school website to say, I wish there were teachers like you in
1375280	1377240	Australia, you know, this is the kind of thing they say.
1377680	1381760	So I know and and from teachers, you know,
1381760	1384040	this isn't this isn't just from families.
1384040	1385440	This is from teachers.
1385440	1389840	So and I think sometimes families can think, oh, these teachers,
1390120	1391880	why are they the way they are?
1391880	1395320	What I need to let everyone know is that there are a whole load of teachers
1395320	1397240	who do agree with what I'm saying.
1397240	1398760	It's just they don't have a voice.
1398760	1401640	They're not in positions of leadership or management in their school.
1401920	1404560	There isn't much that they can do and they're trying.
1404800	1410120	But the culture, we our book, we have two books as a school.
1410120	1411120	We've written them.
1411120	1413720	We all my teachers write a chapter about the kinds of things we've done.
1414160	1415960	And you must have one when you go.
1416120	1419040	And the second one is called the power of culture.
1419600	1424200	And people underestimate how much a culture in an organization
1424440	1427840	affects what happens to the people in that organization.
1428080	1432360	So the children you saw and you said all the hands went up.
1432600	1434240	That's because that's the culture.
1434240	1436880	The culture is if I know the answer, I'm putting my hand up, you know,
1437240	1438600	and I'm excited about it.
1438600	1442120	And the culture is one of I want to show off how much I know,
1442320	1446000	as opposed to if I put my hand up, I'm the nerd of the class
1446000	1447360	and everybody's going to laugh at me.
1447360	1449440	So I don't want to be seen to be putting my hand up.
1449760	1454200	That we have actively worked very hard to create a culture
1454400	1456520	where the kids are really excited about learning.
1456520	1458080	And that's a hard one to achieve.
1458080	1461040	But, you know, and I was about to say, well, once you've got it,
1461040	1463920	but actually you then have to work at just keeping it all the time.
1464000	1467120	You know, and that comes from consistency across all your teachers,
1468120	1470760	a consistency of approach in terms of teaching,
1471280	1475440	in terms of expectations of the children and in terms of behavior management.
1475720	1480000	And that's where you see other teachers and other schools will struggle
1480320	1484040	because doing it on your own in a classroom
1484360	1488840	where the whole school isn't bought into what you're doing is very, very hard.
1489280	1490400	I can understand that.
1490400	1494040	So tell me, eight years in,
1494120	1497280	you've got obviously now quite a few students who have left the school.
1498040	1502040	So how have they gone in exam terms and then out into,
1502040	1504800	if you like, the big wide world beyond the school?
1505120	1508240	Yeah, so we only had one set of GCSE results
1508960	1511280	with our first cohort because, of course, COVID then happened.
1511560	1514880	So there's not been anything national to talk about.
1515160	1518200	This will be the first year where that does happen.
1518280	1522360	But we, you know, in terms of our progress eight,
1522360	1526280	which judges the progress from when they arrive to when they leave,
1526600	1528760	we were the fifth best school in the country.
1529640	1532800	Right. So we did well, you know, now.
1532800	1536040	Fifth best in an area that would normally be seen as very disadvantageous.
1536040	1537280	Yeah, yeah, exactly, exactly.
1537280	1540480	Where many of the children would have had a very tough start in life.
1540480	1541120	Yes, yeah.
1541120	1542800	They didn't get the good foundations.
1542800	1545480	Yes, but that's what we have to do when they arrive in year seven.
1545720	1547600	A lot of it is is damage control,
1547600	1550120	making sure that we get the basics into them
1550120	1552840	because they haven't necessarily picked that up at primary school.
1553320	1556640	Unless you're competing with some of the most expensive institutions
1556640	1558480	in the world when it comes to education.
1558480	1561400	Well, remember, this is progress that they've made that they're judging.
1561640	1563320	So it's not that our children, I mean,
1563320	1565560	some of them are doing very well and have gone off to Oxford and Cambridge,
1565560	1567080	but we have a comprehensive intake.
1567080	1568560	So you've had kids here.
1568560	1571640	Yeah, yeah, if the school had not been here,
1571640	1573920	would any of those kids who have gone to Oxford and Cambridge
1574160	1576440	gone to Oxford and Cambridge?
1576440	1577640	Well, it's hard to say.
1577640	1579320	I mean, it's hard to say.
1579320	1580360	It's hard to imagine.
1580360	1582320	I mean, to be honest, it's less
1582760	1585080	I'm less proud of the Oxford and Cambridge kids
1585080	1589360	and more proud of the kids who were in the bottom set, third set.
1589360	1595240	You know, the ones who aren't cognitively, you know, super brilliant.
1595760	1599840	And they know how to bring all their equipment to school,
1599880	1602280	how to sit up straight, how to have their hand up,
1602360	1603840	how to be interested in learning.
1603840	1605400	They know lots of Shakespeare.
1605400	1610200	They are able to go to a job interview and shake your hand and look you in the eye.
1610440	1612800	They're able to know their stuff and talk about it.
1612800	1616440	You know, they're functionally literate and exactly.
1616720	1617520	They're more than that.
1617520	1619600	I mean, you know, they get decent GCSEs.
1619600	1624760	I mean, and the thing is, is that when they when they're out in life now,
1624880	1627160	you know, some of them will become hairdressers and plumbers
1627160	1630080	and all sorts of, you know, different jobs.
1630680	1633280	But they're going to be really good at those jobs and they're going to live
1633280	1634480	successful lives.
1634480	1637000	Those are the ones I'm most proud of, because those are often the ones
1637000	1640480	that the system fails, whereas the really bright ones.
1640600	1643960	I mean, yes, of course, are ones who went to Oxford and Cambridge and proud of them.
1644200	1645840	And we did a lot for them.
1645840	1646840	Would they have got there or not?
1646840	1648520	I don't know. It's hard to say.
1648520	1653520	But yeah, it really is those other ones who who are often given
1653520	1658160	such a rough deal by the school system, you know, because they can't make up for it.
1658240	1660240	Because of the soft paternalism.
1660240	1664840	Yeah, because because of all the low expectations, the low expectations for them.
1664840	1666640	I mean, it's the same for all the kids, frankly.
1666640	1671600	You know, I find everywhere it's just too much that excuses are made for them.
1672040	1676120	But when you're super bright, you can you can sort of get around that.
1676120	1680280	Even if your teachers have low expectations, you've got really high expectations for yourself.
1680480	1683840	So you end up working loads at home and you can you can overcome that.
1685560	1686960	But a lot of kids can't do that.
1686960	1689080	They need the support and the scaffolding from school.
1690240	1696520	One of the the sort of soft paternalism that that we hear is they're not
1696520	1700920	responsible for the situation that they're in will excuse them.
1701200	1703440	We won't raise expectations.
1703440	1706920	But you actually place a lot of emphasis on individual responsibility.
1707920	1713240	And if I'm reading it correctly, you think it's very important for disadvantaged kids,
1713240	1716120	the very ones that we usually try and say it's not their fault.
1716400	1719400	Yeah, well, you're driving out because
1721200	1725800	disadvantaged children, most of all, need you to hold your standard tie for them
1726040	1728880	so that they gain the knowledge and the skills that they need to succeed in life.
1729160	1732800	If you keep making excuses for them, then they're not going to achieve
1732800	1734080	the things they need to achieve.
1734080	1735080	And then what happens?
1735080	1738440	I mean, you always got to ask yourself when they leave you and they leave school,
1738680	1739760	what happens to them?
1739760	1743000	If they haven't really learned how to read properly, if they're not numerate,
1743160	1745000	then how on earth are they going to succeed in life?
1745000	1746160	They're going to become a victim.
1746160	1747160	Well, indeed.
1747160	1751360	And if you are constantly stoking that victimhood, that sense of victimhood in them,
1751520	1755840	because the other thing is that, look, you can see yourself as a victim
1755920	1758200	or you can see yourself as somebody who's going to succeed.
1758600	1762280	And it doesn't really matter whatever background you've got.
1762280	1764840	You've got to see yourself as somebody who's going to succeed,
1764840	1768320	because you've only got one life and you've got to be able to make a success of it.
1768480	1771280	And if you're somebody who sits around saying life is so hard for me,
1771280	1773840	my father was never around, life is hard for me.
1773840	1777960	I'm growing up in the inner city, life is hard for me because I don't have much money.
1778200	1779360	Well, you can do that.
1779360	1782120	And then one day you'll die and you can look, you'll be on your deathbed.
1782120	1784640	You look back and you say, well, I couldn't really do anything with my life
1784640	1786240	because I was an ethnic minority.
1786240	1787960	I mean, that's just ridiculous.
1787960	1791160	You have got, it doesn't matter what you've got, the cards you've got.
1791400	1793080	Those are the cards you were dealt with.
1793080	1796800	There's nothing you can do about those cards, but you can change the way you react
1796800	1797920	to those cards.
1797920	1801000	You are in control of what you do with those cards.
1801360	1806200	And who, who are we to lower our expectations for these children
1806200	1807680	and say they can't make it?
1807680	1810120	Like it, for me, it's just racism.
1810120	1811360	It's straight up racism.
1811360	1814320	And it's racism that I would say is directed also at poor white kids.
1814320	1816640	You know, so it's not just against ethnic minorities.
1816880	1819920	It's against any child who is the other.
1820240	1825040	And too often the white middle class is other children who are not like them.
1825520	1828040	And they, they wouldn't do it for their own children.
1828240	1830120	They keep their standards high for their own children.
1830120	1833280	But when it comes to other people's children, they then lower those standards
1833440	1835680	because they feel that it makes them into the nicer person.
1837200	1837880	And actually it doesn't.
1837880	1839960	It makes you into the person who lets those children down.
1841000	1843800	That's a very valuable insight and thank you for it.
1844560	1848960	Now, to come to the more traditional approach that you've adopted, and I've seen it,
1849440	1852800	you're teaching European literature, plenty of Shakespeare.
1853360	1858000	You've even praised patriotism and the importance of all children, regardless
1858040	1861360	of race, feeling positively connected to their British heritage.
1861560	1863400	Yeah. I mean, in Australia, you get the impression
1863400	1864880	a lot of kids are actually being raised.
1864880	1866840	Not I'm not blaming teachers actually for this.
1867440	1871440	But culturally, we're saying to them, you're inheriting such a nightmarish,
1871440	1877280	oppressive, post-colonialist, racist society that you ought to be ashamed of.
1877280	1878680	But don't defend it.
1878680	1880320	You're flying in the opposite direction.
1880320	1883960	You're actually saying to kids with nothing in their own heritage as British,
1884200	1885440	that it matters.
1885480	1888600	So so what's the value in teaching the Western canon?
1889120	1893960	And what do you say to those who say that's irrelevant or, you know,
1893960	1897760	you're you're you're making things that were bad sound good.
1897760	1900160	You're instilling them with bad ideas.
1901040	1906320	Yeah. And I suppose it depends on whether or not you think Shakespeare is worth reading.
1906560	1910720	You know, I think he's worth reading simply for the if only because he's been
1910720	1913440	influencing literature for 400 years, you know?
1913680	1916480	I mean, they say, oh, no, we need to have more black authors.
1916480	1919040	Well, you know, I'm a black author, you know, I've written books,
1919200	1922200	but never in a million years would I have my children be reading the things
1922200	1925240	I've written over Shakespeare, because I have been influencing
1925600	1926960	literature for 400 years.
1926960	1930400	If the day that's what you're reading, then some of the other rubbish they're reading.
1931200	1934880	Well, you know, I'm I'm not even judging one way or the other.
1935040	1940240	The fact is that the Western canon is is what schools should be about.
1940480	1942560	Now, when you get to university, you know what?
1942560	1944480	You can do a whole variety of different things there.
1944480	1945920	I don't mind that, you know?
1947040	1950040	You want to look at feminist literature, black literature, all sorts of things.
1950040	1953400	That's fine. And in school, I'm not saying you can't have any of that.
1953400	1958280	You know, we do, you know, we were just reading with our six
1958280	1960920	former in English A level, we're doing Small Island,
1960920	1963600	which is this wonderful story by Andrea Levy,
1965000	1969720	who writes about black people coming from the Caribbean to Britain.
1970560	1972800	On the Windrush and their experiences here.
1972960	1975800	So it's not like we're saying no to any of that.
1976000	1978680	But what we're not doing is campaigning against dead white men.
1978920	1984120	And we include a lot of dead white men in what we do because they're part of the canon.
1985280	1987760	They write beautiful things.
1987880	1993040	I once had a journalist from the Sunday Times, I think it was.
1993640	1997920	He came here and he heard all of our children reciting the poem
1997960	2001200	If by Rudyard Kippling and he said,
2001480	2004320	that's very controversial, Catherine. Are you doing it deliberately?
2005520	2007760	And I said, but it's a very beautiful poem.
2008000	2011520	And not only is it a beautiful poem, it just speaks to the heart of what we're about.
2011600	2015520	Right. We want the children to embody those values that are in the poem If.
2015600	2018120	If you didn't keep your head when all around lose this.
2018280	2020080	Exactly. Exactly.
2020080	2023920	If you can, you know, treat triumph and disaster as both the same.
2023920	2026600	You know, there's so many wonderful lines in there.
2026840	2028400	Mix with a common man.
2028400	2030640	Exactly. And not lose the common touch.
2030640	2032960	Yes. Yeah. I mean, like, it's just.
2034160	2041200	It we choose literature according to what we think will benefit them in terms of values,
2041360	2046560	but also with the canon in mind because we want them to go off and be culturally literate.
2046840	2050960	So ultimately, you want them to be able to open up a broad sheet newspaper
2050960	2052720	and understand all the references.
2052760	2057360	You want them to be able to read a rose would smell as sweet and know what that means.
2057360	2061440	You want them to understand when they hear on the radio, oh, he's a bit of a scrooge
2061600	2066040	and you understand what they need, you know, because otherwise your children,
2066120	2068640	it's not just about being able to decode words.
2068640	2073240	Reading and being successful at reading is not just about decoding.
2073720	2078480	It's about the cultural references that are in the text that you are reading.
2078760	2084960	And there is so much reference to those dead white men to the Western canon in the West.
2085160	2087640	Look, if if we were in China, I wouldn't be suggesting this.
2087840	2089680	We'd be reading Chinese literature, right?
2090200	2094440	So we we are looking at British history.
2094680	2096600	We are looking at British literature.
2096600	2098680	We celebrate the Queen's birthday.
2098680	2102200	We sing God Save the Queen and I've Out of the My Country and Jerusalem.
2103080	2106280	And we do this with pride because we are all British here.
2106520	2114000	And the idea that white teachers should be telling brown and black children
2114000	2117120	that they're not British, it's I think it's horrifying.
2118520	2122160	My little brown and black children are just as entitled to call themselves
2122160	2124280	British as any of the white children are.
2124600	2127880	And and we're all together as one.
2128080	2131840	What our Britishness does is it brings us together because when you're in a
2131840	2134840	multicultural community where some of our children are Muslim, some of them are
2134840	2137880	Hindus, some of them are Sikhs, some of them are Christian.
2138080	2142000	We've got children from Eastern Europe from and when I say from, you know,
2142000	2145920	they tend to be second generation, but their grandparents and sometimes their
2145920	2151800	parents are from India, from Nigeria, from Ghana, from Jamaica, from all over the Caribbean.
2152040	2156280	You know, the fact is that when you have all of that difference,
2156400	2158440	you need something to hold you together.
2158600	2162240	That's what makes a country and that's what makes a country successful.
2162440	2165320	It's what helps to make our schools successful, because we're all bound
2165320	2170440	together by these, by the hymns that we sing, by the poetry that we recite,
2170640	2175800	by the history that we learn, which is our history, as opposed to feeling so
2175800	2178880	uncomfortable about it. Now, that doesn't mean we don't tell them the truth.
2179040	2183760	You know, we don't not teach them about the Atlantic slave trade.
2183880	2188000	We don't. We teach all the good things and the bad things that happen.
2188200	2190960	This is one that comes up all the time in the de-statuary movement.
2191200	2193640	Yeah, horrendous, Britain kept slave for 200 years.
2193760	2197320	It was the first empire, the first culture I've, and I'm a bit of a student
2197320	2199520	of history, that actually abolished it. Yes.
2199560	2203320	And inconveniently, of course, the people who abolished it were extraordinarily
2203320	2208440	privileged, wealthy, white, largely male and often Christian.
2208680	2213320	Yes. Yes. The very people who are now supposedly responsible for all the evils in the world.
2213360	2214080	Yes, that's right.
2214080	2218480	So when they sent out the British Navy to stop other people trading in human
2218480	2220320	misery, yes, and where's the credit for them?
2220480	2223320	Well, those sailors who died in the Royal Navy, racist.
2223320	2227560	Yes. So no, but you see what I'm driving at.
2227800	2230800	So you've got to teach the good with the bad and the bad with the good.
2230800	2231440	Exactly.
2231440	2232240	If you're going to learn.
2232240	2236320	The point is, you need to just teach the facts, you know, so they'll learn that.
2236320	2237760	So they'll know what the facts are.
2237800	2240760	Yes, they'll also understand that slavery was was common.
2241000	2244200	This wasn't just a white on black thing.
2244400	2247240	The triangle where they went to the West Coast of Africa,
2247800	2252200	they purchased slaves from blacks who had gone inland, killed off the ones that
2252200	2256920	couldn't work, that had no value, very cool and bought the rest back to the coast to sell them.
2256920	2258080	Yes, exactly.
2258080	2259760	You know, every culture was involved in this.
2259760	2260560	Yes.
2260560	2263800	As Macron said in France, there was a very interesting point on paraphrasing.
2264520	2267040	By all means, criticize your culture, but know what it is first.
2267200	2274000	Yes. Yes. Although it is also true that a lot of the, you know, what made Britain
2274040	2279200	rich came from that slave trade and that's something that we all need to be
2279200	2281360	aware of and accept and that's fine.
2281360	2285000	I mean, but then the British people were courageous enough to say, we're going to stop it.
2285000	2286800	And that impact despite the wealth.
2286800	2287320	Yes. Yeah.
2287320	2291400	But it had a negative impact on British wealth for many decades.
2291400	2297400	The economists will tell you so they willingly took on a lowering in their standard of living
2297400	2300360	and in their wealth to achieve this great social end.
2300360	2302040	That's we ought to know about that.
2302280	2304560	Are we prepared to make those sort of sacrifices?
2304560	2306240	Yes. Well, I don't know.
2306240	2309840	I'm on people these days don't make any sacrifices for all kinds of levels.
2310280	2315760	Well, I'm guessing some of your kids would be prepared to entertain on what I sort of do, you know, it's true.
2316240	2319360	Our children understand gratitude.
2319360	2321760	We teach them gratitude.
2321760	2324840	We teach them not just to be grateful to their teachers,
2324840	2328760	but to be grateful to their parents and to their wider families for looking after them.
2329080	2337000	And the thing is, is that however little you have, you will always have more than somebody else.
2337680	2340240	And you need to be grateful for that.
2340240	2345960	We teach them about being grateful for the fact that we all live in Britain, you know, like it's a great country.
2346840	2347880	We have the rule of law.
2347880	2349120	We have democracy.
2349120	2352720	We have, you know, we can choose how we want to live.
2352720	2354120	You can choose to be gay.
2354120	2358560	You can choose to get married or not get married or do whatever it is you want.
2358560	2365520	And nobody's going to hassle you for it, you know, it's it's a great thing to be able to live in a country like that.
2365520	2369680	When you think there are so many countries out there where, well, if you're gay,
2369680	2378440	they'll push you off the top of a building, you know, and it's just it's unfortunately these days.
2378440	2385600	The the argument is very skewed and some of the law, you know, the loudest voices out there
2386600	2397720	are only critical of some people, namely people in the West and often politicians,
2397720	2400560	they might be critical of who have more of a conservative point of view.
2400560	2410000	People like me, they're very critical of because I'm a traditionalist and I believe that, you know, I love my country.
2410000	2412720	Looks like you've got plenty of parents who agree with you.
2412720	2414840	Yes, they're curing up to get in.
2414960	2417440	Yes, that's true, although I have to say we are in the inner city.
2417440	2422240	So I think a lot of them don't necessarily understand all of those kinds of details.
2422240	2425520	They might just hear it's a good school, so they want to send their child here.
2425520	2430080	I think some of them will just be because they're living next door and they send their child to the school next door.
2430080	2438200	You know, not all families, of course, are are engaged with their child's education and because this is the inner city.
2438200	2443000	That's the other thing to remember is that these children in the inner city, too many of them,
2443040	2445680	do not have parents who are super engaged.
2445680	2451320	And so if you, as a school, don't scaffold them and support them, they haven't got anybody.
2451320	2456080	Well, this is, yeah, but you've recently said that our obsessive resolve to talk about racism,
2456080	2460320	which is endemic across the West, all a lot of people want to talk about.
2460320	2466080	You know, you're the critical theorist who say it is the problem in the world today.
2466080	2471960	And you said actually, and I'm quoting here, undermines the sense of self-worth that children can have in themselves,
2471960	2476720	that they desperately need to be able to change their stars and make something better of themselves.
2476720	2482880	Yeah, well, the idea there is that if you are stoking this sense of victim in the child,
2482880	2487840	and if you're telling him that the establishment is against him because of his color of the color of his skin,
2487840	2494160	it could be because of his sexuality, it could be that you're telling all the girls that, you know, the patriarchy is going to get them.
2494160	2500040	And whatever the reason is, if you're telling them that the establishment is against them,
2500120	2502320	then why would they work for it?
2502320	2504160	They'll just give up, you know.
2504160	2507880	There needs to be a sense of, look, there are obstacles out there.
2507880	2509200	You're going to have to jump over them.
2509200	2511360	So I don't tell them that there aren't any obstacles.
2511360	2512920	I certainly don't talk about the details.
2512920	2514920	I don't say there is racism, there is sexism.
2514920	2520600	I don't talk about that at all because I know they get enough of that out in the social media world and from everyone else.
2520600	2522040	So I don't talk about that.
2522040	2523960	I just say there are obstacles.
2523960	2524920	And what are you going to do?
2524920	2529920	Sit down and just think, well, I'm done for, or are you going to pick yourself up but going to keep going?
2529920	2534280	You're going to get those GCSEs, you're going to get those A-levels and you're going to get the best place that you can possibly get to.
2534280	2536240	That is the attitude that you need to have.
2536240	2540240	When I was told I couldn't open the school, when I had people protesting outside,
2540240	2542120	we tried to open in three different places.
2542120	2545600	First we tried in Lambeth, they managed to stop us there.
2545600	2548280	Then we tried in Wandsworth, they stopped us there.
2548280	2550760	Then we came to Brent, it took us three and a half years.
2550760	2554920	Did I at any point sit down and think, oh well, I just can't do this, I'm a victim?
2554920	2558400	Or did I think, no, pick myself up each time and I kept on going?
2558400	2560240	And that is what I keep telling my kids.
2560240	2564520	And that is why they are hugely resilient and hugely successful, not the only reason.
2564520	2569240	I mean, obviously they also have a great education in terms of the teachers that they have here or the subjects they learn,
2569240	2570720	the skills they learn and so on.
2570720	2572400	Heroes are important.
2572400	2578280	But exactly, and they need to hear that sense of purpose and drive.
2578280	2581000	And that when you're knocked down, you pick yourself up.
2581000	2586720	But if on the other hand as a teacher, you indulge in that conversation around,
2586720	2591680	woe is me, life is so difficult because my father was an alcoholic or whatever it is,
2591680	2593120	you're never going to get anywhere.
2593120	2595880	And maybe life is more difficult for you.
2595880	2596640	Maybe it's not.
2596640	2598160	I'm not even getting into that conversation.
2598160	2599280	I actually don't care.
2599280	2600280	Who cares?
2600280	2602040	Yes, maybe somebody was racist towards you.
2602040	2603520	You're going to let that ruin your life?
2603520	2607560	Pick yourself up and keep going.
2607560	2610000	There's a lot of talk, and you and I have talked about this before,
2610000	2612880	about the effect that technology is having on children.
2612880	2616040	The internet and iPhones in particular.
2616080	2619240	You actually wrote an article about it, though, since we talked about it,
2619240	2624520	I think, called Digital Detox at your school.
2624520	2625920	What's digital detox?
2625920	2627600	Yeah, we have this whole digital detox system.
2627600	2632520	So I bought this massive safe and the kids are strongly encouraged
2632520	2635920	to give us their phones and their devices.
2635920	2638360	And we put them in the safe.
2638360	2639880	They can give it to us for one night.
2639880	2641560	They can give it to us from Monday to Friday.
2641560	2642720	They can give it to us for the weekend.
2642720	2643320	It's up to them.
2643320	2644880	It's entirely voluntary.
2644880	2650920	And then we keep their phones and we help them sort of break the addiction,
2650920	2651560	as it were.
2651560	2652280	Addiction?
2652280	2654560	Yes, it is definitely an addiction.
2654560	2658240	Some of them don't have phones at all because before they arrive at the school,
2658240	2661520	I speak to every single parent and I say to them,
2661520	2665440	my advice is do not buy your child a smartphone before they come to secondary school
2665440	2667720	because that's often the time, just when they start secondary school,
2667720	2669800	that their parent gives them a smartphone.
2669800	2673120	We sell brick phones here to the parents at a loss.
2673120	2674240	So we buy them for 14.
2674240	2678960	We sell them at 10 so that you can still text, you can still ring them.
2678960	2681400	You have the convenience of staying in touch with your child,
2681400	2685680	but they do not have unsupervised access to the internet because that is so dangerous,
2685680	2687240	whether on a phone or on a laptop.
2687240	2689960	But the point about a laptop is that you'll be there with them at home.
2689960	2691800	You can watch them with the phone.
2691800	2692800	They're out and about on the street.
2692800	2694360	You have no idea who they're meeting.
2694360	2697920	Meeting people in gangs, girls meeting older men,
2697920	2703080	boys meeting all sorts of horrible people who you wouldn't want your boy mixing with.
2703200	2710000	I mean, honestly, it is a genuine danger for children to be given unsupervised access to the internet.
2710000	2712360	And parents don't realise.
2712360	2713360	They don't realise.
2714480	2715480	Take the point.
2716720	2717600	Funding.
2717600	2723680	In Australia, we have almost doubled the per capita funding for children,
2723680	2725720	broadly speaking, particularly in the state system.
2725720	2727880	And every expert who wants to talk about it says,
2727880	2730920	we've got to resource our schools better and if governments don't, they fail.
2730920	2732760	But our academic standards,
2732760	2734320	I mean, you cannot get away from the numbers.
2734320	2736360	They continue to decline.
2736360	2741560	Anxiety, depression and self-harm levels continue to rise.
2741560	2744680	The extra money doesn't seem to be the solution.
2744680	2746680	I'm not saying they shouldn't be well resourced,
2746680	2749440	but it doesn't seem to be the key ingredient.
2749440	2751200	Well, Jonathan Haight, an American,
2751200	2755720	he's done a great job of tracking this sort of thing with children
2755720	2758520	that anxiety and depression levels have risen massively
2758520	2760280	since the introduction of the smartphones.
2760280	2761760	The very thing you were talking about when I went to go.
2761760	2765120	Like, and then your child's mental health falls apart
2765120	2767560	and you don't know why and it's because you gave them a smartphone.
2767560	2770440	And you know, I'm ringing the alarm bells for parents.
2770440	2772760	So all I can say is do not give them a smartphone.
2772760	2774680	And I know it's hard because they'll say,
2774680	2776800	but I'm being left out of conversations.
2776800	2777720	I need to be in there.
2777720	2780160	You just need to love your child enough to hold the line.
2782600	2785320	Yeah, so what was the beginning of what you were saying?
2785320	2789240	Oh, funding, you know, we've increased funding hugely,
2789240	2791480	but it's done nothing to arrest declining standards.
2791840	2794200	And increased problems of anxiety.
2794200	2795200	So I'm ahead.
2795200	2796280	I'm principal of the school.
2796280	2798960	I'll always take more money if they're going to give it to me.
2800040	2802480	And of course, money will make things better in some ways.
2802920	2807200	But we always make the mistake of thinking that more money will
2808400	2810680	is how you fix the problem.
2810680	2814280	And you've got to think, well, why is the problem a problem?
2814560	2816680	Maybe it's because of a bad idea.
2816680	2819200	Maybe it's because we're doing more of what we've always done.
2820160	2822480	Maybe there's something wrong with the teacher training.
2822480	2824200	Maybe there's something wrong with the discipline.
2824200	2826920	Maybe there's something wrong with our expectations of the children.
2827280	2830520	And then we need to go around other schools and see,
2830600	2832320	well, what are they doing differently?
2832320	2835240	How can I take an idea from here and from over there and so on
2835480	2838640	to make where I am better, even though I might not have much money?
2838880	2842800	That is, yeah, that's how we all need to think.
2842800	2846600	But it's much easier to just say, oh, it's because we don't have the funds.
2847600	2851000	I'd say it's because too often we have bad ideas.
2852160	2855000	Well, I know in our country, I don't like left, right, right divides,
2855000	2860160	but it is true that the progressive sort of elements in society,
2860160	2863760	particularly in politics, talk a lot more about education, I think, than others.
2864520	2869840	And yet so often it's just a demand more money
2870320	2872440	or different working conditions for teachers.
2872440	2874040	And I have the utmost respect for teachers.
2874040	2875080	That's not the issue.
2875080	2879800	The focus is not on what is going to help the children prepare for life.
2879800	2880800	Yeah.
2880800	2885000	Well, and I think part of that is because they assume everybody's sort of doing
2885000	2886000	the right things already.
2887840	2890040	And that's where some humility needs to come.
2890560	2896040	We need to start questioning what we've always done and look to others.
2896040	2898880	So most of the stuff that you see happening here at our school,
2899080	2900680	we've just taken from somewhere else.
2900680	2903800	Right? I've been to visit a school and I thought, that's a great idea.
2903800	2904800	Let's use that.
2905200	2906800	I've been to another school. That's a great idea.
2906800	2907800	Let's use that.
2907800	2912800	And so we have adapted and changed so much in order to make sure that the offer
2912800	2916360	that we're giving our children is of the highest possible quality.
2917680	2923600	I think too often schools are just sort of considered the place where children go
2923920	2928920	and they do they get babysat and they learn something and it's all right.
2928920	2931280	And there's some kids who are more driven than others.
2931520	2933600	And that's just how it is.
2933840	2935560	And it can be so much better than that.
2935560	2938680	Isn't there an issue here that I would have thought in this country,
2938680	2942960	I know in ours, education is incredibly important to people who have been successful
2942960	2948400	in life. They will push their kids to the nth degree and they will demand an awful
2948400	2951160	lot from their schools. So you get that at one level.
2951720	2954680	But then there are the taboo subjects that people won't talk about
2956480	2959720	when it comes to children doing well.
2959760	2963880	For example, the home environment is a great predictor of how well prepared
2963880	2967680	the kid will be when they enter school and then how well they'll do through.
2967960	2969680	Yes. And that's true.
2969680	2973600	But a lot of people are not comfortable saying to parents,
2974040	2975880	you know, if you're going to bring kids into the world,
2976200	2978440	you shouldn't bring them into a dysfunctional environment.
2978560	2981640	Yeah. Well, I mean, obviously, I think.
2981640	2983640	But we don't talk about it.
2983640	2985000	No, no one does.
2985000	2988080	And politicians don't because there's nothing in it for them.
2988080	2990920	Why would they go and criticize families, you know, when they want their votes?
2991240	2995320	So I mean, it's not just don't bring them into dysfunctional environments.
2995320	2998720	It's when you have a child, how are you going to invest in them?
2998840	3000880	How are you going to make sure that you are teaching them?
3001240	3003760	Whenever I say this on Twitter about teaching your own child,
3004000	3006440	so many people say to me, I'm not teaching my child.
3006440	3008400	That's the job of schools. Yeah.
3008400	3011840	And I always think, well, OK, then your child isn't going to do that.
3011840	3014920	Well, it's cool because I can tell you that at five years old,
3015080	3017520	there are some children who start school already reading.
3017520	3019840	Yeah. And there are some children who have no idea to read.
3020120	3022840	Now, you can say that the school is going to teach my child.
3022960	3026160	Well, I can tell you for nothing, the ones who already know how to read
3026280	3030440	are at a massive headstock and then they are reading even faster and better
3030440	3032760	and longer books and harder books and so on.
3033000	3035760	And when they're then 12 and they're still reading
3035880	3038920	and they're reading books for 15 year olds and so on,
3039080	3042040	and you look at them and go, gosh, it's amazing.
3042240	3044200	My child never took to reading like that.
3044200	3046560	What was because you never taught them? That's why.
3046600	3051040	Now, when I say teach, I don't mean stand up at home with a blackboard,
3051200	3053000	you know, teaching them algebra.
3053000	3055600	I mean, teach them everything, spend loads of time with them,
3055600	3057800	talk to them loads, read to them loads,
3057920	3060040	draw your finger under the words as you're reading to them.
3060240	3062480	Don't just read them one story before they go to bed.
3062640	3064960	Spend 20, 30 minutes reading to them.
3066520	3068960	Get them to a point where they eventually can read on their own.
3070000	3075400	Do get go to the shop and buy some phonics support and teach them phonics.
3075760	3080320	You can teach them how to read long before they go to school at five.
3080680	3083480	And then when they're at school,
3083520	3086560	support the school by making sure you're not just doing the homework,
3086560	3088200	you're doing more than what they're asking.
3088400	3091760	You're counting the peas on the plate, you're counting the cars on the street.
3091920	3094480	Once they know how to count, you know, let's say to 50,
3094480	3096960	you're then counting by twos, you're then counting by threes.
3097200	3100960	And over a period of years, you learn how to count by threes, fours, five, sixes.
3101120	3102280	And hey, presto, guess what?
3102280	3105720	When you're doing their multiplication tables, suddenly it's really easy.
3105840	3109280	Isn't it funny how that boy just picked up those times tables like that?
3109520	3112840	Well, that's because he had a mom who was counting with him by twos,
3112840	3114720	threes and fours when he was little.
3114720	3116360	And people don't think like that.
3116360	3118840	They just sort of think, well, he just has a knack for maths.
3119000	3122000	No, his mom helped him have that knack for maths.
3122600	3126480	And those years, zero to five, long before they ever get to school,
3126600	3130360	they are so crucial in determining a child's future.
3130600	3132680	So a family is so important.
3132880	3137040	But then my thing is the schools need to be excellent because, sadly,
3137040	3139440	not all children get that kind of support at home.
3139640	3143360	So we try to make up for some of that as much as we can here at McKayla.
3144080	3146160	Don't want to disrupt perfection.
3146160	3148760	I mean, we can't finish on a better note than that.
3149400	3151760	What you've had to say has been of such interest.
3152320	3154560	And I think it's so incredibly important.
3154880	3158520	I only wish there were a whole lot more people with your drive and determination.
3158720	3161840	Thank you in your country and in mine.
3162080	3163880	There are lots, but we need more.
3163880	3164840	Yes. Thank you.
3164840	3166320	Thank you. Thanks for having me.
