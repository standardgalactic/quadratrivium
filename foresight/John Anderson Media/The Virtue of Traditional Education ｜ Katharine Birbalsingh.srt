1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,400
They need to hear that sense of purpose and drive, and that when you're knocked down,

2
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:07,720
you pick yourself up.

3
00:00:07,720 --> 00:00:13,560
But if on the other hand as a teacher, you indulge in that conversation around, whoa

4
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:18,480
is me, life is so difficult because my father was an alcoholic or whatever it is, you're

5
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:19,960
never going to get anywhere.

6
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:22,840
And maybe life is more difficult for you.

7
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:23,840
Maybe it's not.

8
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:24,840
I'm not even getting into that conversation.

9
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:25,840
I actually don't care.

10
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:26,840
Who cares?

11
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:28,680
Yes, maybe somebody was racist towards you.

12
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:30,320
You're going to let that ruin your life?

13
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:44,400
Pick yourself up and keep going.

14
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:50,560
Catherine Berbelsingh is the co-founder and head teacher at Macaela Community School in

15
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:52,880
Inner London.

16
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:59,560
After graduating from Oxford, Catherine became a school teacher and rose to prominence when

17
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:06,280
she gave a speech in 2010 criticising the impact of progressive educational ideas on children's

18
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:08,840
learning outcomes.

19
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:14,000
Finding herself without a job anymore because of that very speech, Catherine set about co-founding

20
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,840
her own school and I'm at it now.

21
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:23,960
It's based explicitly on more traditional educational techniques and social virtues such

22
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:28,000
as gratitude and personal responsibility.

23
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:34,720
Since 2010, Catherine has become one of the world's most prominent voices on education

24
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:39,960
reform and has hundreds of people, including from Australia, visiting her school every

25
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:44,240
year to take back lessons to apply in their own schools.

26
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:51,720
She's written and edited four books, including the latest, Macaela, The Power of Culture,

27
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:58,640
and in 2021 she was appointed chair of the Social Mobility Commission here in the UK.

28
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:03,600
I have to say, having had the privilege of spending some time at the school and sitting

29
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:12,000
in on some classes, hearing kids enthusiastically engage, sitting up respectfully, teachers

30
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:20,440
throwing extraordinary energy into it, discipline, tidiness, focus, you couldn't make this up.

31
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:25,520
So I start from a place of being quite amazed by what I've seen.

32
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:31,440
But Catherine, if I could start, you grew up in Canada, in England, you've travelled

33
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:36,640
the world, you studied French and philosophy at Oxford, and then you went to teach in state

34
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:37,640
schools.

35
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:39,000
Have you always wanted to be a teacher?

36
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,880
Is that your great passion in life?

37
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:46,080
No, I don't think I knew what I wanted to do at Oxford, but then I joined this group

38
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:53,000
which was about sending students from Oxford into the inner city to talk to young people

39
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:58,880
in schools about perhaps applying to Oxford or Cambridge.

40
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:03,920
And the idea was to send students who looked like them, came from their kind of backgrounds,

41
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:05,300
that kind of thing.

42
00:03:05,300 --> 00:03:09,440
So I would go and I would talk to these kids, and at the beginning they'd say, I'm not

43
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:12,480
applying to Oxford or Cambridge, just a bunch of snobs, etc.

44
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:16,480
And by the end of me talking to them, I found that I'd changed some of their minds.

45
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:21,600
And I thought, oh, well this is really nice, I like this, and I like children, I love children.

46
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:23,800
And so I chose that as my career.

47
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:28,720
It was astonishing in some of those classrooms, you can tell the kids that they are really

48
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:32,040
diverse in every way, I suspect.

49
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:36,400
Everything from the home environment they've experienced as kids, right through to their

50
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:42,120
religious practices at home, or none, through to their diets, the whole bit.

51
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:49,400
But they're all sitting there, attentively getting on with it, as I say, you couldn't

52
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:50,400
make it up.

53
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:55,760
But you attracted a lot of attention from the media and your then colleagues, when

54
00:03:55,760 --> 00:04:01,720
you gave a speech at the Conservative Party Conference in 2010, decrying what you called

55
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:06,600
the culture of excuses in the English education system.

56
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:10,160
What did you mean by culture of excuses?

57
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:13,640
Yeah, well, I don't think that you say the English education system, of course I was

58
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:19,240
speaking about that, but I think you find this all over the place, in Australia, for

59
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:24,280
instance, I've seen it there myself first hand, having visited some of your schools.

60
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:29,440
And I think that this is particularly the case for children from poor backgrounds,

61
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:32,080
from ethnic backgrounds.

62
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:36,640
In particular, I saw it in Australia when teachers were talking about Aboriginal children.

63
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:42,280
And it's just low expectations for these children and imagining that they can't really

64
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:44,520
amount very much.

65
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:49,640
And, well, he doesn't have a dad at home, so we're not going to expect him to do his

66
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:55,960
homework, or he lives on that council estate, or he's just from a poor background.

67
00:04:55,960 --> 00:05:01,920
And so it's a bit much to expect him to turn up on time or to have his uniform on or whatever

68
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:06,160
it is the standards are, you drop them because you feel bad for them.

69
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:11,160
So it comes from a nice place, you know, these people are being compassionate, but what they

70
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:15,520
don't understand is that their compassion is killing the child.

71
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:21,440
And I saw a lot of that in Australia, sadly, in particular, directed towards Aboriginal

72
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:22,440
children.

73
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:28,240
I mean, I remember one teacher in one school saying to me that, well, at the end of the

74
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:30,640
day, these children are going to end up in prison.

75
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:34,840
So you just have some fun with them while you can before they end up in prison.

76
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:39,160
And I thought, but if we taught them properly, then maybe they wouldn't end up in prison,

77
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:40,160
you know.

78
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:45,520
You know, in one school, I saw them, they were doing a lot of guitar playing.

79
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:47,920
Well, the children weren't playing guitar.

80
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:51,120
The teacher was playing guitar, and they were all sort of singing together.

81
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:54,520
And I don't have anything against singing, but we did this for a very long time.

82
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:58,960
And I was saying, are there any maths lessons, any English lessons, you know?

83
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:00,200
And there was none of that.

84
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:06,880
And I think that sometimes teachers can look at children who come from different backgrounds

85
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:07,880
to their own.

86
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:11,640
And this isn't just a race issue, it can also be a socioeconomic issue.

87
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:17,720
And they sort of other the child, and they see them as so different, and they feel bad

88
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:22,760
about their own privilege that they've come from a home with two parents or whatever it

89
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:23,760
is.

90
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:27,760
And then they feel bad about sort of expecting more from that child.

91
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:32,440
And in the end, they let that child down because what I always say, if we give a child a detention

92
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:36,200
for not doing his homework, and people say, well, that's really cruel, I always say, you

93
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:40,880
know what's cruel is spending your life being functionally illiterate and functionally enumerate.

94
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:42,040
That's cruel.

95
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:47,680
And it's really about understanding that if you keep your standards high for them now,

96
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:50,800
they're going to be able to succeed later.

97
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:55,440
I just, I don't understand why everyone doesn't see this, but that that that's

98
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:57,800
I'm absolutely with you.

99
00:06:57,800 --> 00:07:06,360
Why progressives in Australia cannot understand that that that that paternalism that that

100
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:13,280
sort of soft racism of low expectations, yeah, that's what it is flies in the face of everything

101
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:15,760
they say they believe in.

102
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:22,640
I know it's because in the moment of making the decision of holding the line, giving the

103
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:27,520
detention, ringing the parent, whatever it is, it feels bad.

104
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:29,880
It makes you feel like you're being mean.

105
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:35,360
And either you love them enough and follow through, and you love them enough to hold

106
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:41,680
them to those high standards, or you actually quite love yourself and the way you feel in

107
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:42,960
that moment.

108
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:51,680
And you you allow that to trump the desire, the long term desire for the child to succeed.

109
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:53,240
That's what's going on there.

110
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:58,200
And people need to sort of be honest with themselves and just think, well, am I actually

111
00:07:58,200 --> 00:08:03,160
dropping my standards for some of these children and and not do it really?

112
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:05,520
You know, you just got to force yourself.

113
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:07,080
And and that's what we do here.

114
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:09,960
We have the same standards for everybody, whatever your background.

115
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:15,160
So Catherine, as I walk around the school and I say endless photographs of people like

116
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:19,800
the now Prime Minister Boris Johnson here, members of the Royal Family, of outstanding

117
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:23,440
sports people, of other educators praising what you do here.

118
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:28,040
I do notice one interesting one from a man who happens to be an African American just

119
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:31,920
on the wall here, where you're saying if you really want to serve someone else's interests,

120
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:32,920
you'll tell them the truth.

121
00:08:32,920 --> 00:08:33,920
Yes.

122
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:36,680
If you just want to serve your own, you'll tell them what they want to hear.

123
00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:39,480
It's a pretty important philosophy for a teacher, isn't it?

124
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:41,520
What's really going to serve the child?

125
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:43,600
Yes, exactly.

126
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:53,640
So we all know the school where we feel bad about marking them down on their work because

127
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:54,840
they made a good effort.

128
00:08:55,080 --> 00:09:00,360
And so you give them the A and you tell them it was great, even though it really isn't very good.

129
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:02,560
But then what happens in the end?

130
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:04,000
The child thinks he's doing really well.

131
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,600
And then in the end, he fails all these exams and he thinks, well, why am I failing?

132
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:09,000
You told me I was doing really well.

133
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:14,960
I mean, for years in this country, we had a whole system of national assessment where

134
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:17,240
we would give these national assessment grades every year.

135
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:19,240
They were utterly incomprehensible to everybody.

136
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:21,960
I mean, parents couldn't understand them, teachers couldn't understand them.

137
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:27,800
And we all just, it was one A, one B, one C, one A, two A, two B, two C.

138
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:29,360
And we just used to make it up.

139
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:31,600
I mean, you would go in there and you think, well, I gave him a two B last time.

140
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:32,960
I'm talking about two C this time.

141
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:36,160
I mean, you were just, you were honestly, it was so ridiculous.

142
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:47,080
Schools can be what everyone needs when it comes to schooling is there

143
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:48,360
needs to be a goal.

144
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:51,200
It's not just something that you do.

145
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:52,880
That's what I find that people think.

146
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:57,160
You send your child to school and they go and they come home.

147
00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:01,400
You know, so often when I've said to journalists, you don't understand.

148
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:03,280
Schools are failing our children.

149
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:06,600
And every single one of them will say to me, but our schools are fine.

150
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:07,680
What do you mean?

151
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:09,520
My child's okay and he's at school.

152
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,240
And I say, how do you know?

153
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:14,920
And they'll say, well, he's okay.

154
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:16,480
I say, but he comes home from school.

155
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:18,640
You ask him, how was your day?

156
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:20,280
He says, fine.

157
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:21,520
He goes to his room.

158
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:24,280
Well, how do you know?

159
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:26,240
You don't know what's going on in his classroom.

160
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:28,000
You don't know the quality of the teaching.

161
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,400
You don't know the quality of the questioning, the quality of the explanations,

162
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:31,200
the quality of the homework.

163
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:33,480
Does the homework actually match what they were doing in the lesson in the first

164
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:36,200
place? Is it drilling them in the right things that they need to know?

165
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:38,800
Is it like, you have no idea.

166
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,760
Is it stretching them where they need to be stretched?

167
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:44,120
Is it encouraging independent thought in this kind of way, but making sure that

168
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:45,640
the basis is covered in another kind of way?

169
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:49,360
Like there's so I could go on for hours about the details of what makes a good

170
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:51,000
teacher and what makes for good teaching.

171
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:55,320
Too often people think that teaching is just something you do when you couldn't

172
00:10:55,320 --> 00:11:01,080
do something else, when actually it is, you know, a game for only the super

173
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:02,320
talented, right?

174
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:10,600
Well, I couldn't believe the energy and the drive and the engagement with their

175
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:13,840
students that I saw amongst five or six of your teachers today.

176
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:15,080
It was astonishing.

177
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:19,600
They must be utterly worn out of the end of the term, let alone the end,

178
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:21,080
you know, probably the end of the day.

179
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:27,680
Well, that's a really interesting point because I would say, and I know this

180
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:32,000
from talking to my teachers, they are less worn out here than they were at

181
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:32,840
their other schools.

182
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:33,720
Fascinating.

183
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:36,760
And it's true that they're giving their heart and soul and they absolutely

184
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:38,320
love it and they love the kids and so on.

185
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:43,280
But they're also not having to deal with rudeness, chat back to them, you

186
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:48,640
know, kids marching out of lessons, them having to bring irate parents, dealing

187
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:51,600
with that, there's none of that kind of friction.

188
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:54,440
So emotionally, it's a lot less draining.

189
00:11:55,000 --> 00:12:00,560
It's true that they give a lot, but they do, they're not as drained as they,

190
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:02,360
as they were at their other schools.

191
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:04,480
But teaching is tiring.

192
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:05,360
It's very tiring.

193
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:08,920
I have the, you know, whether it's because of the disciplinary problems,

194
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:11,920
which I don't blame the teachers for, you know, some of them are to blame,

195
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:15,720
but not a lot, most of them are not, whether it's the expectations, the

196
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:17,280
report writing and so forth put on them.

197
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:21,560
I fully accept it is a very demanding profession and one that ought to be

198
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,480
better recognized in every way by the community.

199
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:29,120
But, but now back to, so you gave that speech, you know, you, you dared to talk

200
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:33,520
about some culture of excesses, and suddenly you're out on your ear.

201
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:34,840
No one wants to employ you.

202
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:35,480
Yes.

203
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:40,280
It was quite a struggle to start the school, I don't imagine, to find people

204
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:42,400
who'd support you, the local government authorities.

205
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:46,400
So this is again, this problem of who's thinking of the kids' real interests?

206
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:46,880
Yes.

207
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:47,640
Yeah.

208
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:52,560
Well, unfortunately, education is real political football at the time.

209
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:55,440
The Conservative Party were the ones that introduced this idea of free schools.

210
00:12:56,440 --> 00:13:00,200
I decided that I needed to set up my own school because I just couldn't get back

211
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:04,040
into the state sector because they wouldn't have me because I'd done the

212
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:06,840
unthinkable and I'd spoken at the Conservative Party and that really is

213
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:08,960
just a no-no when it comes to education.

214
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:12,680
And not that anybody says that to you, but you just kind of know that that's

215
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:13,440
what's going on.

216
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:14,920
That's where our culture works now.

217
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:16,760
You know when you've been quietly cancelled.

218
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:17,440
Exactly.

219
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:20,040
And it's interesting because it was before council culture became a thing,

220
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:23,760
but I was one of the earlier cancellations as it were, you know.

221
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:24,960
That's very encouraging.

222
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:26,800
There might be people out there feeling cancelled.

223
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:27,600
You can survive it.

224
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:32,720
You can, but it's true that it takes an enormous amount of guts and determination.

225
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:36,200
So for three and a half years, I worked to be able to set up this school.

226
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:43,000
We had all kinds of detractors protesting, sending me horrible emails, death threats,

227
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,040
all kind of craziness.

228
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:45,960
I mean, like just you wouldn't believe it.

229
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:51,440
I kept saying, you'd think we were creating, you know, building nuclear bombs.

230
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:55,600
I mean, we were just trying to set up a school in the inner city to help

231
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:57,280
children who are deprived.

232
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:58,920
I mean, what is the problem?

233
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:00,640
But they really didn't like me.

234
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:02,560
One, because I'd spoken at the Conservative Party Conference.

235
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:04,160
Two, because of the things I was saying.

236
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:08,680
So I was saying that the system wasn't good enough and you're not allowed

237
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:11,560
to criticize education and I was doing it openly.

238
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:16,240
I still do it, you know, and that's because I think you criticize what you love.

239
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:19,800
You know, if you're not critical and if you don't hold the education system

240
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:23,360
to high standards, then we'll all just bob along being mediocre and we don't want that.

241
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:26,280
So we set up the school eventually.

242
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:29,040
But when I say there were protests, I mean, there were people when we had our first

243
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:33,360
year group, 120 year seven kids, so 11 year olds here.

244
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:38,640
There were people protesting outside, handing them leaflets, telling them their

245
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:42,560
lives were in danger in this building because it was a health and safety hazard.

246
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:44,240
I mean, can you imagine this building?

247
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:46,400
Yeah, it's one of the best school buildings I've seen.

248
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:49,600
Well, at the time we were doing refurbishments.

249
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:52,120
You had to walk through a kind of tunnel to get through.

250
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:56,320
And of course, all the self health and safety boxes had been ticked,

251
00:14:56,640 --> 00:14:59,360
but they were just making up any nonsense.

252
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:03,400
Any form of storm in true Catherine fashion.

253
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:07,200
I saw a couple of these flyers that they were handing them.

254
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:08,320
So I took the flyer.

255
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:11,440
I photocopied it 120 times and I gave it to all the children.

256
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:15,160
And I said, when you go outside and see them, you can wave it in their faces

257
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:18,400
and you can say my headmistress has already given me a copy.

258
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:19,560
Well done. That was clever.

259
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:20,800
It was very clever.

260
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:25,200
I'll come to silencing the critics by the all performance in a moment.

261
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:31,760
But before I do, so you set up in 2014, you finally found a building,

262
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:36,920
a council that would support you, despite that opposition locally that you talked about.

263
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:38,960
But you said there's a very interesting.

264
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:42,600
It's anti progressivist in its philosophical origins.

265
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:47,520
What do you mean by progressivist educational philosophy?

266
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:51,280
And just as a matter of interest, how might parents identify it?

267
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:54,480
Because I think a lot of parents are confused about what's happening in schools.

268
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:57,280
Yeah, no, that's very true.

269
00:15:57,280 --> 00:16:00,800
And I think, you know, a lot of our kids come here because we're in too many schools,

270
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:02,840
I should say, rather than blanket them all.

271
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:04,080
But in too many schools, yeah.

272
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:05,080
Yeah.

273
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:12,840
Well, actually, I'd probably say the vast majority of schools are too progressive.

274
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:15,160
There are very few.

275
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:17,280
Yes, absolutely.

276
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:18,560
There are very few schools.

277
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:21,080
You have to go against the zeitgeist.

278
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:29,000
You have to have made a firm decision to to throw out what everyone's telling you to do.

279
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:32,720
And there are a few heads out there who do that, but we are few and far between.

280
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:37,240
And so that's why I say the vast majority, because the teacher training institutions,

281
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:42,400
the general culture in 2022 is one of progressivism.

282
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:44,760
So what do we mean by that?

283
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:49,160
Advice for the parents who are watching is when you go into the classrooms,

284
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:53,880
are the desks grouped together so that the children are facing each other?

285
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:59,080
So we're in a classroom right now here and the desks are facing the front of the classroom

286
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:02,440
and the teacher would be at the front, leading the learning.

287
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:06,000
In other progressive classrooms, the desks are grouped together.

288
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:10,560
And then the idea is the children are the ones leading the learning, not the teacher.

289
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:14,440
And then the teacher gives them a task which they get on with together.

290
00:17:14,840 --> 00:17:19,280
So they're leading the learning together and the teacher might move amongst the desks,

291
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:23,280
keeping them on task, as opposed to the teacher being at the front,

292
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:25,840
being the figure of authority and leading that learning.

293
00:17:26,080 --> 00:17:27,920
So that's one very obvious way to tell.

294
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:31,640
Then there's just the values stuff.

295
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:36,360
You know, when you read their website, do they talk about tradition?

296
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:41,520
Do they talk about valuing, having traditional values?

297
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:44,400
Or do they say we're very modern?

298
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:46,360
Do they talk a lot about technology?

299
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:52,320
Do they talk about, you know, children finding themselves?

300
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:54,080
That's the kind of thing that they might say.

301
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:57,200
Now, you think, well, why wouldn't you want a child to find themselves?

302
00:17:57,440 --> 00:17:58,640
I'm not against that.

303
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:01,000
It's just that's the phrasing that they'll use.

304
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,120
That's where you look really, isn't it?

305
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:08,600
Yeah, so children finding themselves, children, you know, being who they want to be,

306
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:12,840
that kind of thing, as opposed to we're more of a traditional outfit

307
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:17,400
where we believe children need to acquire knowledge and skills to succeed at life.

308
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:22,040
And we are here to teach them and guide them and lead them

309
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:23,920
and look after them and love them.

310
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:27,200
You know, that that that's all under the traditional umbrella.

311
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:32,480
The progressive umbrella is children need to explore for themselves.

312
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:38,120
Children need to be free to express themselves

313
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:40,120
and to find who they are, as it were.

314
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:44,560
And the thing is, some viewers might listen to that and go, that sounds really great.

315
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:48,120
The problem with progressivism is that it's so seductive

316
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:51,440
because you listen to it and you think, that's what I want as an adult.

317
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:52,440
I want to be free.

318
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:53,880
I want to express myself.

319
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:57,640
I want to find who I am, and that's absolutely fine for an adult.

320
00:18:58,560 --> 00:19:02,800
The thing is, is that children are not experts and children need guidance.

321
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:07,200
So when you take your four year old out to the road, you don't say, here's the road.

322
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:10,640
Go find yourself, because he'll get squashed by a car.

323
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:16,360
What you do is you hold his hand and you gradually teach him how to cross the road

324
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:19,440
until eventually he's able to do it on his own.

325
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,240
And that will take years.

326
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:24,920
It takes years to get a child to the point where he can cross the road on his own

327
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:26,480
because he has to look both ways.

328
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:28,600
He has to have a sense of when the car is going to stop.

329
00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:32,120
He then needs to be able to get across the road in a quick and safe manner.

330
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:36,320
There are so many skills that are involved there in crossing the road.

331
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:40,200
And I have to say, most parents instinctively know not to just allow

332
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:42,240
their child to be free when it comes to crossing the road.

333
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:45,720
They don't necessarily know that when it comes to the classroom.

334
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:47,440
It's the same with anything.

335
00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:52,000
You need children to be habituated and to be drilled in the basics

336
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:54,040
so that they could then build up from that.

337
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:56,280
And you scaffold them the whole time.

338
00:19:56,400 --> 00:20:00,440
You're there as their parent or their teacher, constantly scaffolding,

339
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:05,480
helping them get to a point where, yes, they are then adults and they are free

340
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:11,000
to be able to succeed and fail and try again and fail again and so on.

341
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:16,360
But unless they've had that that traditional scaffolding and teaching

342
00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:19,880
of knowledge and skills, if that hasn't happened properly

343
00:20:20,040 --> 00:20:23,560
because they have been left to child-centered learning

344
00:20:23,560 --> 00:20:26,880
where they are leading themselves, they simply won't know as much

345
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:29,240
as the child who's been in the more traditional classroom.

346
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:34,760
I must say, I was just I could not get over the bond between teacher and student.

347
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:41,240
All eyes on the teacher, the teacher engaging with enormous energy.

348
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:44,600
And I was looking for the kid who didn't put their hand up

349
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:49,520
when that was time to answer a question or maybe I couldn't find one.

350
00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:51,840
I'm a bit. Well, there are some.

351
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:54,280
But yeah, I didn't find one today.

352
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:57,280
Just the dynamics of it were extraordinary.

353
00:20:57,640 --> 00:21:00,440
So let's drill into this a bit more.

354
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:02,800
You've been going since 2014.

355
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:05,160
So you've got a bit of an idea of how it's working now.

356
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:07,160
Yeah. Is it silencing the critics?

357
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:08,800
What's it look like success?

358
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:12,280
Yeah, because it's about more than just academic results.

359
00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:14,800
But my guess is the academic results are good.

360
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:17,720
What do you see about the students that have been right through now?

361
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:20,400
Yes. And is it silencing the critics?

362
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:22,960
Oh, many of them, it has science.

363
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:26,000
There were a whole bunch of people who were very vocal before

364
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,640
who were protesting outside and so on. We don't get protesters anymore.

365
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:32,360
So in that sense, it's been a huge success.

366
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:36,840
A lot of people who were on the fence, I find I have a lot of people

367
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:39,680
following me on Twitter and I find I'll go to a conference.

368
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:42,440
I'll be on the street and somebody will run up to me and say,

369
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:46,600
I can't say this out loud, but I just want you to know you have my support.

370
00:21:48,760 --> 00:21:50,320
Be useful. I did say it out loud.

371
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:52,800
I know, but I don't I don't blame them. I get it.

372
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,960
So there are I have a lot of silence supporters

373
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:58,160
and silent followers who never say anything.

374
00:21:58,280 --> 00:22:01,680
And I must always remind myself of this because sometimes I can get

375
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:05,160
distracted by the the vocal minorities.

376
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:07,360
I do think they are a vocal minority.

377
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:11,840
It's just that the minority have the power.

378
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:13,080
That's the thing.

379
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:14,760
They have the media outlets.

380
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:18,680
They have the politicians ears or they are actually the politicians.

381
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:24,080
And so those people are they just have so much power.

382
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:28,280
It's ordinary families who where they don't have any power at all,

383
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:30,400
who might be supportive, but they just can't say anything.

384
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:33,000
Families and then teachers, ordinary teachers,

385
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:35,640
we get over 600 visitors a year who come to the school.

386
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:37,080
Most of those are teachers.

387
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:38,880
Some of those are Australian teachers.

388
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:42,320
I have I've had Australian teachers writing to me who have never been here,

389
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:45,600
but saying because I've been on some Australian news bit.

390
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:46,920
And, you know, yes, you have.

391
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:50,600
So I'll I'll I'll be in the news and then I'll get we'll get a few emails

392
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:51,920
through to the website here.

393
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:55,280
They get on the school website to say, I wish there were teachers like you in

394
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:57,240
Australia, you know, this is the kind of thing they say.

395
00:22:57,680 --> 00:23:01,760
So I know and and from teachers, you know,

396
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:04,040
this isn't this isn't just from families.

397
00:23:04,040 --> 00:23:05,440
This is from teachers.

398
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:09,840
So and I think sometimes families can think, oh, these teachers,

399
00:23:10,120 --> 00:23:11,880
why are they the way they are?

400
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:15,320
What I need to let everyone know is that there are a whole load of teachers

401
00:23:15,320 --> 00:23:17,240
who do agree with what I'm saying.

402
00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:18,760
It's just they don't have a voice.

403
00:23:18,760 --> 00:23:21,640
They're not in positions of leadership or management in their school.

404
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:24,560
There isn't much that they can do and they're trying.

405
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:30,120
But the culture, we our book, we have two books as a school.

406
00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:31,120
We've written them.

407
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:33,720
We all my teachers write a chapter about the kinds of things we've done.

408
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:35,960
And you must have one when you go.

409
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:39,040
And the second one is called the power of culture.

410
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:44,200
And people underestimate how much a culture in an organization

411
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:47,840
affects what happens to the people in that organization.

412
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:52,360
So the children you saw and you said all the hands went up.

413
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:54,240
That's because that's the culture.

414
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:56,880
The culture is if I know the answer, I'm putting my hand up, you know,

415
00:23:57,240 --> 00:23:58,600
and I'm excited about it.

416
00:23:58,600 --> 00:24:02,120
And the culture is one of I want to show off how much I know,

417
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:06,000
as opposed to if I put my hand up, I'm the nerd of the class

418
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,360
and everybody's going to laugh at me.

419
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:09,440
So I don't want to be seen to be putting my hand up.

420
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:14,200
That we have actively worked very hard to create a culture

421
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:16,520
where the kids are really excited about learning.

422
00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:18,080
And that's a hard one to achieve.

423
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:21,040
But, you know, and I was about to say, well, once you've got it,

424
00:24:21,040 --> 00:24:23,920
but actually you then have to work at just keeping it all the time.

425
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:27,120
You know, and that comes from consistency across all your teachers,

426
00:24:28,120 --> 00:24:30,760
a consistency of approach in terms of teaching,

427
00:24:31,280 --> 00:24:35,440
in terms of expectations of the children and in terms of behavior management.

428
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:40,000
And that's where you see other teachers and other schools will struggle

429
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:44,040
because doing it on your own in a classroom

430
00:24:44,360 --> 00:24:48,840
where the whole school isn't bought into what you're doing is very, very hard.

431
00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:50,400
I can understand that.

432
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:54,040
So tell me, eight years in,

433
00:24:54,120 --> 00:24:57,280
you've got obviously now quite a few students who have left the school.

434
00:24:58,040 --> 00:25:02,040
So how have they gone in exam terms and then out into,

435
00:25:02,040 --> 00:25:04,800
if you like, the big wide world beyond the school?

436
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:08,240
Yeah, so we only had one set of GCSE results

437
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:11,280
with our first cohort because, of course, COVID then happened.

438
00:25:11,560 --> 00:25:14,880
So there's not been anything national to talk about.

439
00:25:15,160 --> 00:25:18,200
This will be the first year where that does happen.

440
00:25:18,280 --> 00:25:22,360
But we, you know, in terms of our progress eight,

441
00:25:22,360 --> 00:25:26,280
which judges the progress from when they arrive to when they leave,

442
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:28,760
we were the fifth best school in the country.

443
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:32,800
Right. So we did well, you know, now.

444
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:36,040
Fifth best in an area that would normally be seen as very disadvantageous.

445
00:25:36,040 --> 00:25:37,280
Yeah, yeah, exactly, exactly.

446
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:40,480
Where many of the children would have had a very tough start in life.

447
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:41,120
Yes, yeah.

448
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:42,800
They didn't get the good foundations.

449
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:45,480
Yes, but that's what we have to do when they arrive in year seven.

450
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:47,600
A lot of it is is damage control,

451
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:50,120
making sure that we get the basics into them

452
00:25:50,120 --> 00:25:52,840
because they haven't necessarily picked that up at primary school.

453
00:25:53,320 --> 00:25:56,640
Unless you're competing with some of the most expensive institutions

454
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:58,480
in the world when it comes to education.

455
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:01,400
Well, remember, this is progress that they've made that they're judging.

456
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:03,320
So it's not that our children, I mean,

457
00:26:03,320 --> 00:26:05,560
some of them are doing very well and have gone off to Oxford and Cambridge,

458
00:26:05,560 --> 00:26:07,080
but we have a comprehensive intake.

459
00:26:07,080 --> 00:26:08,560
So you've had kids here.

460
00:26:08,560 --> 00:26:11,640
Yeah, yeah, if the school had not been here,

461
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:13,920
would any of those kids who have gone to Oxford and Cambridge

462
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:16,440
gone to Oxford and Cambridge?

463
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:17,640
Well, it's hard to say.

464
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:19,320
I mean, it's hard to say.

465
00:26:19,320 --> 00:26:20,360
It's hard to imagine.

466
00:26:20,360 --> 00:26:22,320
I mean, to be honest, it's less

467
00:26:22,760 --> 00:26:25,080
I'm less proud of the Oxford and Cambridge kids

468
00:26:25,080 --> 00:26:29,360
and more proud of the kids who were in the bottom set, third set.

469
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:35,240
You know, the ones who aren't cognitively, you know, super brilliant.

470
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:39,840
And they know how to bring all their equipment to school,

471
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:42,280
how to sit up straight, how to have their hand up,

472
00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:43,840
how to be interested in learning.

473
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:45,400
They know lots of Shakespeare.

474
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:50,200
They are able to go to a job interview and shake your hand and look you in the eye.

475
00:26:50,440 --> 00:26:52,800
They're able to know their stuff and talk about it.

476
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:56,440
You know, they're functionally literate and exactly.

477
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:57,520
They're more than that.

478
00:26:57,520 --> 00:26:59,600
I mean, you know, they get decent GCSEs.

479
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:04,760
I mean, and the thing is, is that when they when they're out in life now,

480
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:07,160
you know, some of them will become hairdressers and plumbers

481
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:10,080
and all sorts of, you know, different jobs.

482
00:27:10,680 --> 00:27:13,280
But they're going to be really good at those jobs and they're going to live

483
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:14,480
successful lives.

484
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:17,000
Those are the ones I'm most proud of, because those are often the ones

485
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:20,480
that the system fails, whereas the really bright ones.

486
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:23,960
I mean, yes, of course, are ones who went to Oxford and Cambridge and proud of them.

487
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:25,840
And we did a lot for them.

488
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:26,840
Would they have got there or not?

489
00:27:26,840 --> 00:27:28,520
I don't know. It's hard to say.

490
00:27:28,520 --> 00:27:33,520
But yeah, it really is those other ones who who are often given

491
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:38,160
such a rough deal by the school system, you know, because they can't make up for it.

492
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:40,240
Because of the soft paternalism.

493
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:44,840
Yeah, because because of all the low expectations, the low expectations for them.

494
00:27:44,840 --> 00:27:46,640
I mean, it's the same for all the kids, frankly.

495
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:51,600
You know, I find everywhere it's just too much that excuses are made for them.

496
00:27:52,040 --> 00:27:56,120
But when you're super bright, you can you can sort of get around that.

497
00:27:56,120 --> 00:28:00,280
Even if your teachers have low expectations, you've got really high expectations for yourself.

498
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:03,840
So you end up working loads at home and you can you can overcome that.

499
00:28:05,560 --> 00:28:06,960
But a lot of kids can't do that.

500
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:09,080
They need the support and the scaffolding from school.

501
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:16,520
One of the the sort of soft paternalism that that we hear is they're not

502
00:28:16,520 --> 00:28:20,920
responsible for the situation that they're in will excuse them.

503
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:23,440
We won't raise expectations.

504
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:26,920
But you actually place a lot of emphasis on individual responsibility.

505
00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:33,240
And if I'm reading it correctly, you think it's very important for disadvantaged kids,

506
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:36,120
the very ones that we usually try and say it's not their fault.

507
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:39,400
Yeah, well, you're driving out because

508
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:45,800
disadvantaged children, most of all, need you to hold your standard tie for them

509
00:28:46,040 --> 00:28:48,880
so that they gain the knowledge and the skills that they need to succeed in life.

510
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:52,800
If you keep making excuses for them, then they're not going to achieve

511
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:54,080
the things they need to achieve.

512
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:55,080
And then what happens?

513
00:28:55,080 --> 00:28:58,440
I mean, you always got to ask yourself when they leave you and they leave school,

514
00:28:58,680 --> 00:28:59,760
what happens to them?

515
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:03,000
If they haven't really learned how to read properly, if they're not numerate,

516
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:05,000
then how on earth are they going to succeed in life?

517
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:06,160
They're going to become a victim.

518
00:29:06,160 --> 00:29:07,160
Well, indeed.

519
00:29:07,160 --> 00:29:11,360
And if you are constantly stoking that victimhood, that sense of victimhood in them,

520
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:15,840
because the other thing is that, look, you can see yourself as a victim

521
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:18,200
or you can see yourself as somebody who's going to succeed.

522
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:22,280
And it doesn't really matter whatever background you've got.

523
00:29:22,280 --> 00:29:24,840
You've got to see yourself as somebody who's going to succeed,

524
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:28,320
because you've only got one life and you've got to be able to make a success of it.

525
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:31,280
And if you're somebody who sits around saying life is so hard for me,

526
00:29:31,280 --> 00:29:33,840
my father was never around, life is hard for me.

527
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:37,960
I'm growing up in the inner city, life is hard for me because I don't have much money.

528
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:39,360
Well, you can do that.

529
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:42,120
And then one day you'll die and you can look, you'll be on your deathbed.

530
00:29:42,120 --> 00:29:44,640
You look back and you say, well, I couldn't really do anything with my life

531
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:46,240
because I was an ethnic minority.

532
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:47,960
I mean, that's just ridiculous.

533
00:29:47,960 --> 00:29:51,160
You have got, it doesn't matter what you've got, the cards you've got.

534
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:53,080
Those are the cards you were dealt with.

535
00:29:53,080 --> 00:29:56,800
There's nothing you can do about those cards, but you can change the way you react

536
00:29:56,800 --> 00:29:57,920
to those cards.

537
00:29:57,920 --> 00:30:01,000
You are in control of what you do with those cards.

538
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:06,200
And who, who are we to lower our expectations for these children

539
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:07,680
and say they can't make it?

540
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:10,120
Like it, for me, it's just racism.

541
00:30:10,120 --> 00:30:11,360
It's straight up racism.

542
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:14,320
And it's racism that I would say is directed also at poor white kids.

543
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:16,640
You know, so it's not just against ethnic minorities.

544
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:19,920
It's against any child who is the other.

545
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:25,040
And too often the white middle class is other children who are not like them.

546
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:28,040
And they, they wouldn't do it for their own children.

547
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:30,120
They keep their standards high for their own children.

548
00:30:30,120 --> 00:30:33,280
But when it comes to other people's children, they then lower those standards

549
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:35,680
because they feel that it makes them into the nicer person.

550
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:37,880
And actually it doesn't.

551
00:30:37,880 --> 00:30:39,960
It makes you into the person who lets those children down.

552
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:43,800
That's a very valuable insight and thank you for it.

553
00:30:44,560 --> 00:30:48,960
Now, to come to the more traditional approach that you've adopted, and I've seen it,

554
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:52,800
you're teaching European literature, plenty of Shakespeare.

555
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:58,000
You've even praised patriotism and the importance of all children, regardless

556
00:30:58,040 --> 00:31:01,360
of race, feeling positively connected to their British heritage.

557
00:31:01,560 --> 00:31:03,400
Yeah. I mean, in Australia, you get the impression

558
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:04,880
a lot of kids are actually being raised.

559
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:06,840
Not I'm not blaming teachers actually for this.

560
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:11,440
But culturally, we're saying to them, you're inheriting such a nightmarish,

561
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:17,280
oppressive, post-colonialist, racist society that you ought to be ashamed of.

562
00:31:17,280 --> 00:31:18,680
But don't defend it.

563
00:31:18,680 --> 00:31:20,320
You're flying in the opposite direction.

564
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:23,960
You're actually saying to kids with nothing in their own heritage as British,

565
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:25,440
that it matters.

566
00:31:25,480 --> 00:31:28,600
So so what's the value in teaching the Western canon?

567
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:33,960
And what do you say to those who say that's irrelevant or, you know,

568
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:37,760
you're you're you're making things that were bad sound good.

569
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:40,160
You're instilling them with bad ideas.

570
00:31:41,040 --> 00:31:46,320
Yeah. And I suppose it depends on whether or not you think Shakespeare is worth reading.

571
00:31:46,560 --> 00:31:50,720
You know, I think he's worth reading simply for the if only because he's been

572
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:53,440
influencing literature for 400 years, you know?

573
00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:56,480
I mean, they say, oh, no, we need to have more black authors.

574
00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:59,040
Well, you know, I'm a black author, you know, I've written books,

575
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:02,200
but never in a million years would I have my children be reading the things

576
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:05,240
I've written over Shakespeare, because I have been influencing

577
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:06,960
literature for 400 years.

578
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:10,400
If the day that's what you're reading, then some of the other rubbish they're reading.

579
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:14,880
Well, you know, I'm I'm not even judging one way or the other.

580
00:32:15,040 --> 00:32:20,240
The fact is that the Western canon is is what schools should be about.

581
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:22,560
Now, when you get to university, you know what?

582
00:32:22,560 --> 00:32:24,480
You can do a whole variety of different things there.

583
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:25,920
I don't mind that, you know?

584
00:32:27,040 --> 00:32:30,040
You want to look at feminist literature, black literature, all sorts of things.

585
00:32:30,040 --> 00:32:33,400
That's fine. And in school, I'm not saying you can't have any of that.

586
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:38,280
You know, we do, you know, we were just reading with our six

587
00:32:38,280 --> 00:32:40,920
former in English A level, we're doing Small Island,

588
00:32:40,920 --> 00:32:43,600
which is this wonderful story by Andrea Levy,

589
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:49,720
who writes about black people coming from the Caribbean to Britain.

590
00:32:50,560 --> 00:32:52,800
On the Windrush and their experiences here.

591
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:55,800
So it's not like we're saying no to any of that.

592
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,680
But what we're not doing is campaigning against dead white men.

593
00:32:58,920 --> 00:33:04,120
And we include a lot of dead white men in what we do because they're part of the canon.

594
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:07,760
They write beautiful things.

595
00:33:07,880 --> 00:33:13,040
I once had a journalist from the Sunday Times, I think it was.

596
00:33:13,640 --> 00:33:17,920
He came here and he heard all of our children reciting the poem

597
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:21,200
If by Rudyard Kippling and he said,

598
00:33:21,480 --> 00:33:24,320
that's very controversial, Catherine. Are you doing it deliberately?

599
00:33:25,520 --> 00:33:27,760
And I said, but it's a very beautiful poem.

600
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:31,520
And not only is it a beautiful poem, it just speaks to the heart of what we're about.

601
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:35,520
Right. We want the children to embody those values that are in the poem If.

602
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:38,120
If you didn't keep your head when all around lose this.

603
00:33:38,280 --> 00:33:40,080
Exactly. Exactly.

604
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:43,920
If you can, you know, treat triumph and disaster as both the same.

605
00:33:43,920 --> 00:33:46,600
You know, there's so many wonderful lines in there.

606
00:33:46,840 --> 00:33:48,400
Mix with a common man.

607
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:50,640
Exactly. And not lose the common touch.

608
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:52,960
Yes. Yeah. I mean, like, it's just.

609
00:33:54,160 --> 00:34:01,200
It we choose literature according to what we think will benefit them in terms of values,

610
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:06,560
but also with the canon in mind because we want them to go off and be culturally literate.

611
00:34:06,840 --> 00:34:10,960
So ultimately, you want them to be able to open up a broad sheet newspaper

612
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:12,720
and understand all the references.

613
00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:17,360
You want them to be able to read a rose would smell as sweet and know what that means.

614
00:34:17,360 --> 00:34:21,440
You want them to understand when they hear on the radio, oh, he's a bit of a scrooge

615
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:26,040
and you understand what they need, you know, because otherwise your children,

616
00:34:26,120 --> 00:34:28,640
it's not just about being able to decode words.

617
00:34:28,640 --> 00:34:33,240
Reading and being successful at reading is not just about decoding.

618
00:34:33,720 --> 00:34:38,480
It's about the cultural references that are in the text that you are reading.

619
00:34:38,760 --> 00:34:44,960
And there is so much reference to those dead white men to the Western canon in the West.

620
00:34:45,160 --> 00:34:47,640
Look, if if we were in China, I wouldn't be suggesting this.

621
00:34:47,840 --> 00:34:49,680
We'd be reading Chinese literature, right?

622
00:34:50,200 --> 00:34:54,440
So we we are looking at British history.

623
00:34:54,680 --> 00:34:56,600
We are looking at British literature.

624
00:34:56,600 --> 00:34:58,680
We celebrate the Queen's birthday.

625
00:34:58,680 --> 00:35:02,200
We sing God Save the Queen and I've Out of the My Country and Jerusalem.

626
00:35:03,080 --> 00:35:06,280
And we do this with pride because we are all British here.

627
00:35:06,520 --> 00:35:14,000
And the idea that white teachers should be telling brown and black children

628
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:17,120
that they're not British, it's I think it's horrifying.

629
00:35:18,520 --> 00:35:22,160
My little brown and black children are just as entitled to call themselves

630
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:24,280
British as any of the white children are.

631
00:35:24,600 --> 00:35:27,880
And and we're all together as one.

632
00:35:28,080 --> 00:35:31,840
What our Britishness does is it brings us together because when you're in a

633
00:35:31,840 --> 00:35:34,840
multicultural community where some of our children are Muslim, some of them are

634
00:35:34,840 --> 00:35:37,880
Hindus, some of them are Sikhs, some of them are Christian.

635
00:35:38,080 --> 00:35:42,000
We've got children from Eastern Europe from and when I say from, you know,

636
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:45,920
they tend to be second generation, but their grandparents and sometimes their

637
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:51,800
parents are from India, from Nigeria, from Ghana, from Jamaica, from all over the Caribbean.

638
00:35:52,040 --> 00:35:56,280
You know, the fact is that when you have all of that difference,

639
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:58,440
you need something to hold you together.

640
00:35:58,600 --> 00:36:02,240
That's what makes a country and that's what makes a country successful.

641
00:36:02,440 --> 00:36:05,320
It's what helps to make our schools successful, because we're all bound

642
00:36:05,320 --> 00:36:10,440
together by these, by the hymns that we sing, by the poetry that we recite,

643
00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:15,800
by the history that we learn, which is our history, as opposed to feeling so

644
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:18,880
uncomfortable about it. Now, that doesn't mean we don't tell them the truth.

645
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:23,760
You know, we don't not teach them about the Atlantic slave trade.

646
00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:28,000
We don't. We teach all the good things and the bad things that happen.

647
00:36:28,200 --> 00:36:30,960
This is one that comes up all the time in the de-statuary movement.

648
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:33,640
Yeah, horrendous, Britain kept slave for 200 years.

649
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:37,320
It was the first empire, the first culture I've, and I'm a bit of a student

650
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:39,520
of history, that actually abolished it. Yes.

651
00:36:39,560 --> 00:36:43,320
And inconveniently, of course, the people who abolished it were extraordinarily

652
00:36:43,320 --> 00:36:48,440
privileged, wealthy, white, largely male and often Christian.

653
00:36:48,680 --> 00:36:53,320
Yes. Yes. The very people who are now supposedly responsible for all the evils in the world.

654
00:36:53,360 --> 00:36:54,080
Yes, that's right.

655
00:36:54,080 --> 00:36:58,480
So when they sent out the British Navy to stop other people trading in human

656
00:36:58,480 --> 00:37:00,320
misery, yes, and where's the credit for them?

657
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:03,320
Well, those sailors who died in the Royal Navy, racist.

658
00:37:03,320 --> 00:37:07,560
Yes. So no, but you see what I'm driving at.

659
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:10,800
So you've got to teach the good with the bad and the bad with the good.

660
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:11,440
Exactly.

661
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:12,240
If you're going to learn.

662
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:16,320
The point is, you need to just teach the facts, you know, so they'll learn that.

663
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:17,760
So they'll know what the facts are.

664
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:20,760
Yes, they'll also understand that slavery was was common.

665
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:24,200
This wasn't just a white on black thing.

666
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:27,240
The triangle where they went to the West Coast of Africa,

667
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:32,200
they purchased slaves from blacks who had gone inland, killed off the ones that

668
00:37:32,200 --> 00:37:36,920
couldn't work, that had no value, very cool and bought the rest back to the coast to sell them.

669
00:37:36,920 --> 00:37:38,080
Yes, exactly.

670
00:37:38,080 --> 00:37:39,760
You know, every culture was involved in this.

671
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:40,560
Yes.

672
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:43,800
As Macron said in France, there was a very interesting point on paraphrasing.

673
00:37:44,520 --> 00:37:47,040
By all means, criticize your culture, but know what it is first.

674
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:54,000
Yes. Yes. Although it is also true that a lot of the, you know, what made Britain

675
00:37:54,040 --> 00:37:59,200
rich came from that slave trade and that's something that we all need to be

676
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:01,360
aware of and accept and that's fine.

677
00:38:01,360 --> 00:38:05,000
I mean, but then the British people were courageous enough to say, we're going to stop it.

678
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:06,800
And that impact despite the wealth.

679
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:07,320
Yes. Yeah.

680
00:38:07,320 --> 00:38:11,400
But it had a negative impact on British wealth for many decades.

681
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:17,400
The economists will tell you so they willingly took on a lowering in their standard of living

682
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:20,360
and in their wealth to achieve this great social end.

683
00:38:20,360 --> 00:38:22,040
That's we ought to know about that.

684
00:38:22,280 --> 00:38:24,560
Are we prepared to make those sort of sacrifices?

685
00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:26,240
Yes. Well, I don't know.

686
00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:29,840
I'm on people these days don't make any sacrifices for all kinds of levels.

687
00:38:30,280 --> 00:38:35,760
Well, I'm guessing some of your kids would be prepared to entertain on what I sort of do, you know, it's true.

688
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:39,360
Our children understand gratitude.

689
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:41,760
We teach them gratitude.

690
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:44,840
We teach them not just to be grateful to their teachers,

691
00:38:44,840 --> 00:38:48,760
but to be grateful to their parents and to their wider families for looking after them.

692
00:38:49,080 --> 00:38:57,000
And the thing is, is that however little you have, you will always have more than somebody else.

693
00:38:57,680 --> 00:39:00,240
And you need to be grateful for that.

694
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:05,960
We teach them about being grateful for the fact that we all live in Britain, you know, like it's a great country.

695
00:39:06,840 --> 00:39:07,880
We have the rule of law.

696
00:39:07,880 --> 00:39:09,120
We have democracy.

697
00:39:09,120 --> 00:39:12,720
We have, you know, we can choose how we want to live.

698
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:14,120
You can choose to be gay.

699
00:39:14,120 --> 00:39:18,560
You can choose to get married or not get married or do whatever it is you want.

700
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:25,520
And nobody's going to hassle you for it, you know, it's it's a great thing to be able to live in a country like that.

701
00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:29,680
When you think there are so many countries out there where, well, if you're gay,

702
00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:38,440
they'll push you off the top of a building, you know, and it's just it's unfortunately these days.

703
00:39:38,440 --> 00:39:45,600
The the argument is very skewed and some of the law, you know, the loudest voices out there

704
00:39:46,600 --> 00:39:57,720
are only critical of some people, namely people in the West and often politicians,

705
00:39:57,720 --> 00:40:00,560
they might be critical of who have more of a conservative point of view.

706
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:10,000
People like me, they're very critical of because I'm a traditionalist and I believe that, you know, I love my country.

707
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,720
Looks like you've got plenty of parents who agree with you.

708
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:14,840
Yes, they're curing up to get in.

709
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:17,440
Yes, that's true, although I have to say we are in the inner city.

710
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:22,240
So I think a lot of them don't necessarily understand all of those kinds of details.

711
00:40:22,240 --> 00:40:25,520
They might just hear it's a good school, so they want to send their child here.

712
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:30,080
I think some of them will just be because they're living next door and they send their child to the school next door.

713
00:40:30,080 --> 00:40:38,200
You know, not all families, of course, are are engaged with their child's education and because this is the inner city.

714
00:40:38,200 --> 00:40:43,000
That's the other thing to remember is that these children in the inner city, too many of them,

715
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:45,680
do not have parents who are super engaged.

716
00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:51,320
And so if you, as a school, don't scaffold them and support them, they haven't got anybody.

717
00:40:51,320 --> 00:40:56,080
Well, this is, yeah, but you've recently said that our obsessive resolve to talk about racism,

718
00:40:56,080 --> 00:41:00,320
which is endemic across the West, all a lot of people want to talk about.

719
00:41:00,320 --> 00:41:06,080
You know, you're the critical theorist who say it is the problem in the world today.

720
00:41:06,080 --> 00:41:11,960
And you said actually, and I'm quoting here, undermines the sense of self-worth that children can have in themselves,

721
00:41:11,960 --> 00:41:16,720
that they desperately need to be able to change their stars and make something better of themselves.

722
00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:22,880
Yeah, well, the idea there is that if you are stoking this sense of victim in the child,

723
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:27,840
and if you're telling him that the establishment is against him because of his color of the color of his skin,

724
00:41:27,840 --> 00:41:34,160
it could be because of his sexuality, it could be that you're telling all the girls that, you know, the patriarchy is going to get them.

725
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:40,040
And whatever the reason is, if you're telling them that the establishment is against them,

726
00:41:40,120 --> 00:41:42,320
then why would they work for it?

727
00:41:42,320 --> 00:41:44,160
They'll just give up, you know.

728
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:47,880
There needs to be a sense of, look, there are obstacles out there.

729
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:49,200
You're going to have to jump over them.

730
00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:51,360
So I don't tell them that there aren't any obstacles.

731
00:41:51,360 --> 00:41:52,920
I certainly don't talk about the details.

732
00:41:52,920 --> 00:41:54,920
I don't say there is racism, there is sexism.

733
00:41:54,920 --> 00:42:00,600
I don't talk about that at all because I know they get enough of that out in the social media world and from everyone else.

734
00:42:00,600 --> 00:42:02,040
So I don't talk about that.

735
00:42:02,040 --> 00:42:03,960
I just say there are obstacles.

736
00:42:03,960 --> 00:42:04,920
And what are you going to do?

737
00:42:04,920 --> 00:42:09,920
Sit down and just think, well, I'm done for, or are you going to pick yourself up but going to keep going?

738
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:14,280
You're going to get those GCSEs, you're going to get those A-levels and you're going to get the best place that you can possibly get to.

739
00:42:14,280 --> 00:42:16,240
That is the attitude that you need to have.

740
00:42:16,240 --> 00:42:20,240
When I was told I couldn't open the school, when I had people protesting outside,

741
00:42:20,240 --> 00:42:22,120
we tried to open in three different places.

742
00:42:22,120 --> 00:42:25,600
First we tried in Lambeth, they managed to stop us there.

743
00:42:25,600 --> 00:42:28,280
Then we tried in Wandsworth, they stopped us there.

744
00:42:28,280 --> 00:42:30,760
Then we came to Brent, it took us three and a half years.

745
00:42:30,760 --> 00:42:34,920
Did I at any point sit down and think, oh well, I just can't do this, I'm a victim?

746
00:42:34,920 --> 00:42:38,400
Or did I think, no, pick myself up each time and I kept on going?

747
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:40,240
And that is what I keep telling my kids.

748
00:42:40,240 --> 00:42:44,520
And that is why they are hugely resilient and hugely successful, not the only reason.

749
00:42:44,520 --> 00:42:49,240
I mean, obviously they also have a great education in terms of the teachers that they have here or the subjects they learn,

750
00:42:49,240 --> 00:42:50,720
the skills they learn and so on.

751
00:42:50,720 --> 00:42:52,400
Heroes are important.

752
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:58,280
But exactly, and they need to hear that sense of purpose and drive.

753
00:42:58,280 --> 00:43:01,000
And that when you're knocked down, you pick yourself up.

754
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:06,720
But if on the other hand as a teacher, you indulge in that conversation around,

755
00:43:06,720 --> 00:43:11,680
woe is me, life is so difficult because my father was an alcoholic or whatever it is,

756
00:43:11,680 --> 00:43:13,120
you're never going to get anywhere.

757
00:43:13,120 --> 00:43:15,880
And maybe life is more difficult for you.

758
00:43:15,880 --> 00:43:16,640
Maybe it's not.

759
00:43:16,640 --> 00:43:18,160
I'm not even getting into that conversation.

760
00:43:18,160 --> 00:43:19,280
I actually don't care.

761
00:43:19,280 --> 00:43:20,280
Who cares?

762
00:43:20,280 --> 00:43:22,040
Yes, maybe somebody was racist towards you.

763
00:43:22,040 --> 00:43:23,520
You're going to let that ruin your life?

764
00:43:23,520 --> 00:43:27,560
Pick yourself up and keep going.

765
00:43:27,560 --> 00:43:30,000
There's a lot of talk, and you and I have talked about this before,

766
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:32,880
about the effect that technology is having on children.

767
00:43:32,880 --> 00:43:36,040
The internet and iPhones in particular.

768
00:43:36,080 --> 00:43:39,240
You actually wrote an article about it, though, since we talked about it,

769
00:43:39,240 --> 00:43:44,520
I think, called Digital Detox at your school.

770
00:43:44,520 --> 00:43:45,920
What's digital detox?

771
00:43:45,920 --> 00:43:47,600
Yeah, we have this whole digital detox system.

772
00:43:47,600 --> 00:43:52,520
So I bought this massive safe and the kids are strongly encouraged

773
00:43:52,520 --> 00:43:55,920
to give us their phones and their devices.

774
00:43:55,920 --> 00:43:58,360
And we put them in the safe.

775
00:43:58,360 --> 00:43:59,880
They can give it to us for one night.

776
00:43:59,880 --> 00:44:01,560
They can give it to us from Monday to Friday.

777
00:44:01,560 --> 00:44:02,720
They can give it to us for the weekend.

778
00:44:02,720 --> 00:44:03,320
It's up to them.

779
00:44:03,320 --> 00:44:04,880
It's entirely voluntary.

780
00:44:04,880 --> 00:44:10,920
And then we keep their phones and we help them sort of break the addiction,

781
00:44:10,920 --> 00:44:11,560
as it were.

782
00:44:11,560 --> 00:44:12,280
Addiction?

783
00:44:12,280 --> 00:44:14,560
Yes, it is definitely an addiction.

784
00:44:14,560 --> 00:44:18,240
Some of them don't have phones at all because before they arrive at the school,

785
00:44:18,240 --> 00:44:21,520
I speak to every single parent and I say to them,

786
00:44:21,520 --> 00:44:25,440
my advice is do not buy your child a smartphone before they come to secondary school

787
00:44:25,440 --> 00:44:27,720
because that's often the time, just when they start secondary school,

788
00:44:27,720 --> 00:44:29,800
that their parent gives them a smartphone.

789
00:44:29,800 --> 00:44:33,120
We sell brick phones here to the parents at a loss.

790
00:44:33,120 --> 00:44:34,240
So we buy them for 14.

791
00:44:34,240 --> 00:44:38,960
We sell them at 10 so that you can still text, you can still ring them.

792
00:44:38,960 --> 00:44:41,400
You have the convenience of staying in touch with your child,

793
00:44:41,400 --> 00:44:45,680
but they do not have unsupervised access to the internet because that is so dangerous,

794
00:44:45,680 --> 00:44:47,240
whether on a phone or on a laptop.

795
00:44:47,240 --> 00:44:49,960
But the point about a laptop is that you'll be there with them at home.

796
00:44:49,960 --> 00:44:51,800
You can watch them with the phone.

797
00:44:51,800 --> 00:44:52,800
They're out and about on the street.

798
00:44:52,800 --> 00:44:54,360
You have no idea who they're meeting.

799
00:44:54,360 --> 00:44:57,920
Meeting people in gangs, girls meeting older men,

800
00:44:57,920 --> 00:45:03,080
boys meeting all sorts of horrible people who you wouldn't want your boy mixing with.

801
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:10,000
I mean, honestly, it is a genuine danger for children to be given unsupervised access to the internet.

802
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:12,360
And parents don't realise.

803
00:45:12,360 --> 00:45:13,360
They don't realise.

804
00:45:14,480 --> 00:45:15,480
Take the point.

805
00:45:16,720 --> 00:45:17,600
Funding.

806
00:45:17,600 --> 00:45:23,680
In Australia, we have almost doubled the per capita funding for children,

807
00:45:23,680 --> 00:45:25,720
broadly speaking, particularly in the state system.

808
00:45:25,720 --> 00:45:27,880
And every expert who wants to talk about it says,

809
00:45:27,880 --> 00:45:30,920
we've got to resource our schools better and if governments don't, they fail.

810
00:45:30,920 --> 00:45:32,760
But our academic standards,

811
00:45:32,760 --> 00:45:34,320
I mean, you cannot get away from the numbers.

812
00:45:34,320 --> 00:45:36,360
They continue to decline.

813
00:45:36,360 --> 00:45:41,560
Anxiety, depression and self-harm levels continue to rise.

814
00:45:41,560 --> 00:45:44,680
The extra money doesn't seem to be the solution.

815
00:45:44,680 --> 00:45:46,680
I'm not saying they shouldn't be well resourced,

816
00:45:46,680 --> 00:45:49,440
but it doesn't seem to be the key ingredient.

817
00:45:49,440 --> 00:45:51,200
Well, Jonathan Haight, an American,

818
00:45:51,200 --> 00:45:55,720
he's done a great job of tracking this sort of thing with children

819
00:45:55,720 --> 00:45:58,520
that anxiety and depression levels have risen massively

820
00:45:58,520 --> 00:46:00,280
since the introduction of the smartphones.

821
00:46:00,280 --> 00:46:01,760
The very thing you were talking about when I went to go.

822
00:46:01,760 --> 00:46:05,120
Like, and then your child's mental health falls apart

823
00:46:05,120 --> 00:46:07,560
and you don't know why and it's because you gave them a smartphone.

824
00:46:07,560 --> 00:46:10,440
And you know, I'm ringing the alarm bells for parents.

825
00:46:10,440 --> 00:46:12,760
So all I can say is do not give them a smartphone.

826
00:46:12,760 --> 00:46:14,680
And I know it's hard because they'll say,

827
00:46:14,680 --> 00:46:16,800
but I'm being left out of conversations.

828
00:46:16,800 --> 00:46:17,720
I need to be in there.

829
00:46:17,720 --> 00:46:20,160
You just need to love your child enough to hold the line.

830
00:46:22,600 --> 00:46:25,320
Yeah, so what was the beginning of what you were saying?

831
00:46:25,320 --> 00:46:29,240
Oh, funding, you know, we've increased funding hugely,

832
00:46:29,240 --> 00:46:31,480
but it's done nothing to arrest declining standards.

833
00:46:31,840 --> 00:46:34,200
And increased problems of anxiety.

834
00:46:34,200 --> 00:46:35,200
So I'm ahead.

835
00:46:35,200 --> 00:46:36,280
I'm principal of the school.

836
00:46:36,280 --> 00:46:38,960
I'll always take more money if they're going to give it to me.

837
00:46:40,040 --> 00:46:42,480
And of course, money will make things better in some ways.

838
00:46:42,920 --> 00:46:47,200
But we always make the mistake of thinking that more money will

839
00:46:48,400 --> 00:46:50,680
is how you fix the problem.

840
00:46:50,680 --> 00:46:54,280
And you've got to think, well, why is the problem a problem?

841
00:46:54,560 --> 00:46:56,680
Maybe it's because of a bad idea.

842
00:46:56,680 --> 00:46:59,200
Maybe it's because we're doing more of what we've always done.

843
00:47:00,160 --> 00:47:02,480
Maybe there's something wrong with the teacher training.

844
00:47:02,480 --> 00:47:04,200
Maybe there's something wrong with the discipline.

845
00:47:04,200 --> 00:47:06,920
Maybe there's something wrong with our expectations of the children.

846
00:47:07,280 --> 00:47:10,520
And then we need to go around other schools and see,

847
00:47:10,600 --> 00:47:12,320
well, what are they doing differently?

848
00:47:12,320 --> 00:47:15,240
How can I take an idea from here and from over there and so on

849
00:47:15,480 --> 00:47:18,640
to make where I am better, even though I might not have much money?

850
00:47:18,880 --> 00:47:22,800
That is, yeah, that's how we all need to think.

851
00:47:22,800 --> 00:47:26,600
But it's much easier to just say, oh, it's because we don't have the funds.

852
00:47:27,600 --> 00:47:31,000
I'd say it's because too often we have bad ideas.

853
00:47:32,160 --> 00:47:35,000
Well, I know in our country, I don't like left, right, right divides,

854
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:40,160
but it is true that the progressive sort of elements in society,

855
00:47:40,160 --> 00:47:43,760
particularly in politics, talk a lot more about education, I think, than others.

856
00:47:44,520 --> 00:47:49,840
And yet so often it's just a demand more money

857
00:47:50,320 --> 00:47:52,440
or different working conditions for teachers.

858
00:47:52,440 --> 00:47:54,040
And I have the utmost respect for teachers.

859
00:47:54,040 --> 00:47:55,080
That's not the issue.

860
00:47:55,080 --> 00:47:59,800
The focus is not on what is going to help the children prepare for life.

861
00:47:59,800 --> 00:48:00,800
Yeah.

862
00:48:00,800 --> 00:48:05,000
Well, and I think part of that is because they assume everybody's sort of doing

863
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:06,000
the right things already.

864
00:48:07,840 --> 00:48:10,040
And that's where some humility needs to come.

865
00:48:10,560 --> 00:48:16,040
We need to start questioning what we've always done and look to others.

866
00:48:16,040 --> 00:48:18,880
So most of the stuff that you see happening here at our school,

867
00:48:19,080 --> 00:48:20,680
we've just taken from somewhere else.

868
00:48:20,680 --> 00:48:23,800
Right? I've been to visit a school and I thought, that's a great idea.

869
00:48:23,800 --> 00:48:24,800
Let's use that.

870
00:48:25,200 --> 00:48:26,800
I've been to another school. That's a great idea.

871
00:48:26,800 --> 00:48:27,800
Let's use that.

872
00:48:27,800 --> 00:48:32,800
And so we have adapted and changed so much in order to make sure that the offer

873
00:48:32,800 --> 00:48:36,360
that we're giving our children is of the highest possible quality.

874
00:48:37,680 --> 00:48:43,600
I think too often schools are just sort of considered the place where children go

875
00:48:43,920 --> 00:48:48,920
and they do they get babysat and they learn something and it's all right.

876
00:48:48,920 --> 00:48:51,280
And there's some kids who are more driven than others.

877
00:48:51,520 --> 00:48:53,600
And that's just how it is.

878
00:48:53,840 --> 00:48:55,560
And it can be so much better than that.

879
00:48:55,560 --> 00:48:58,680
Isn't there an issue here that I would have thought in this country,

880
00:48:58,680 --> 00:49:02,960
I know in ours, education is incredibly important to people who have been successful

881
00:49:02,960 --> 00:49:08,400
in life. They will push their kids to the nth degree and they will demand an awful

882
00:49:08,400 --> 00:49:11,160
lot from their schools. So you get that at one level.

883
00:49:11,720 --> 00:49:14,680
But then there are the taboo subjects that people won't talk about

884
00:49:16,480 --> 00:49:19,720
when it comes to children doing well.

885
00:49:19,760 --> 00:49:23,880
For example, the home environment is a great predictor of how well prepared

886
00:49:23,880 --> 00:49:27,680
the kid will be when they enter school and then how well they'll do through.

887
00:49:27,960 --> 00:49:29,680
Yes. And that's true.

888
00:49:29,680 --> 00:49:33,600
But a lot of people are not comfortable saying to parents,

889
00:49:34,040 --> 00:49:35,880
you know, if you're going to bring kids into the world,

890
00:49:36,200 --> 00:49:38,440
you shouldn't bring them into a dysfunctional environment.

891
00:49:38,560 --> 00:49:41,640
Yeah. Well, I mean, obviously, I think.

892
00:49:41,640 --> 00:49:43,640
But we don't talk about it.

893
00:49:43,640 --> 00:49:45,000
No, no one does.

894
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:48,080
And politicians don't because there's nothing in it for them.

895
00:49:48,080 --> 00:49:50,920
Why would they go and criticize families, you know, when they want their votes?

896
00:49:51,240 --> 00:49:55,320
So I mean, it's not just don't bring them into dysfunctional environments.

897
00:49:55,320 --> 00:49:58,720
It's when you have a child, how are you going to invest in them?

898
00:49:58,840 --> 00:50:00,880
How are you going to make sure that you are teaching them?

899
00:50:01,240 --> 00:50:03,760
Whenever I say this on Twitter about teaching your own child,

900
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:06,440
so many people say to me, I'm not teaching my child.

901
00:50:06,440 --> 00:50:08,400
That's the job of schools. Yeah.

902
00:50:08,400 --> 00:50:11,840
And I always think, well, OK, then your child isn't going to do that.

903
00:50:11,840 --> 00:50:14,920
Well, it's cool because I can tell you that at five years old,

904
00:50:15,080 --> 00:50:17,520
there are some children who start school already reading.

905
00:50:17,520 --> 00:50:19,840
Yeah. And there are some children who have no idea to read.

906
00:50:20,120 --> 00:50:22,840
Now, you can say that the school is going to teach my child.

907
00:50:22,960 --> 00:50:26,160
Well, I can tell you for nothing, the ones who already know how to read

908
00:50:26,280 --> 00:50:30,440
are at a massive headstock and then they are reading even faster and better

909
00:50:30,440 --> 00:50:32,760
and longer books and harder books and so on.

910
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:35,760
And when they're then 12 and they're still reading

911
00:50:35,880 --> 00:50:38,920
and they're reading books for 15 year olds and so on,

912
00:50:39,080 --> 00:50:42,040
and you look at them and go, gosh, it's amazing.

913
00:50:42,240 --> 00:50:44,200
My child never took to reading like that.

914
00:50:44,200 --> 00:50:46,560
What was because you never taught them? That's why.

915
00:50:46,600 --> 00:50:51,040
Now, when I say teach, I don't mean stand up at home with a blackboard,

916
00:50:51,200 --> 00:50:53,000
you know, teaching them algebra.

917
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:55,600
I mean, teach them everything, spend loads of time with them,

918
00:50:55,600 --> 00:50:57,800
talk to them loads, read to them loads,

919
00:50:57,920 --> 00:51:00,040
draw your finger under the words as you're reading to them.

920
00:51:00,240 --> 00:51:02,480
Don't just read them one story before they go to bed.

921
00:51:02,640 --> 00:51:04,960
Spend 20, 30 minutes reading to them.

922
00:51:06,520 --> 00:51:08,960
Get them to a point where they eventually can read on their own.

923
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:15,400
Do get go to the shop and buy some phonics support and teach them phonics.

924
00:51:15,760 --> 00:51:20,320
You can teach them how to read long before they go to school at five.

925
00:51:20,680 --> 00:51:23,480
And then when they're at school,

926
00:51:23,520 --> 00:51:26,560
support the school by making sure you're not just doing the homework,

927
00:51:26,560 --> 00:51:28,200
you're doing more than what they're asking.

928
00:51:28,400 --> 00:51:31,760
You're counting the peas on the plate, you're counting the cars on the street.

929
00:51:31,920 --> 00:51:34,480
Once they know how to count, you know, let's say to 50,

930
00:51:34,480 --> 00:51:36,960
you're then counting by twos, you're then counting by threes.

931
00:51:37,200 --> 00:51:40,960
And over a period of years, you learn how to count by threes, fours, five, sixes.

932
00:51:41,120 --> 00:51:42,280
And hey, presto, guess what?

933
00:51:42,280 --> 00:51:45,720
When you're doing their multiplication tables, suddenly it's really easy.

934
00:51:45,840 --> 00:51:49,280
Isn't it funny how that boy just picked up those times tables like that?

935
00:51:49,520 --> 00:51:52,840
Well, that's because he had a mom who was counting with him by twos,

936
00:51:52,840 --> 00:51:54,720
threes and fours when he was little.

937
00:51:54,720 --> 00:51:56,360
And people don't think like that.

938
00:51:56,360 --> 00:51:58,840
They just sort of think, well, he just has a knack for maths.

939
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:02,000
No, his mom helped him have that knack for maths.

940
00:52:02,600 --> 00:52:06,480
And those years, zero to five, long before they ever get to school,

941
00:52:06,600 --> 00:52:10,360
they are so crucial in determining a child's future.

942
00:52:10,600 --> 00:52:12,680
So a family is so important.

943
00:52:12,880 --> 00:52:17,040
But then my thing is the schools need to be excellent because, sadly,

944
00:52:17,040 --> 00:52:19,440
not all children get that kind of support at home.

945
00:52:19,640 --> 00:52:23,360
So we try to make up for some of that as much as we can here at McKayla.

946
00:52:24,080 --> 00:52:26,160
Don't want to disrupt perfection.

947
00:52:26,160 --> 00:52:28,760
I mean, we can't finish on a better note than that.

948
00:52:29,400 --> 00:52:31,760
What you've had to say has been of such interest.

949
00:52:32,320 --> 00:52:34,560
And I think it's so incredibly important.

950
00:52:34,880 --> 00:52:38,520
I only wish there were a whole lot more people with your drive and determination.

951
00:52:38,720 --> 00:52:41,840
Thank you in your country and in mine.

952
00:52:42,080 --> 00:52:43,880
There are lots, but we need more.

953
00:52:43,880 --> 00:52:44,840
Yes. Thank you.

954
00:52:44,840 --> 00:52:46,320
Thank you. Thanks for having me.
