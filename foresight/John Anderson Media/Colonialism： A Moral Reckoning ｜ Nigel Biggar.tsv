0	8160	Colonial government never sought to perpetuate genocide, and on the contrary a colonial government
8160	13920	strove to moderate the impact of settlers on natives, particularly in the 1800s,
13920	18720	after there had been this kind of moral revolution in England. And again, even Joe Christianity was
18720	24000	a major force here. Colonial government tried to moderate the impact of settlers on natives
24720	27280	and strove to to to restrain violence.
38880	43280	Nigel Bigger, who I count a friend and has been with us on this program before,
43920	49760	is Emeritus Regis Professor of Moral and Pastoral Theology at the University of Oxford.
50320	55840	His most recent book is Colonialism, a Moral Reckoning.
56640	58320	Nigel, thank you so much for joining us.
59040	60480	My pleasure to be back again, John.
61120	65840	Now, the many things that someone with your extensive list of qualifications and background
65840	74080	could have chosen to do, you've written a book about colonialism. Why? And you argue that it's not
74800	79600	the original sin, as some people say, it is of countries like Britain.
81760	88000	So, John, that's a good question. And the first thing I'd say is, I've been reading,
88960	95280	although I'm a theologian and an ethicist professionally, my first love was always history
95280	100960	and my preferred reading is history. And I've been reading about, in particular, British imperial
100960	111280	history for 20, 30 years. And so in recent times, when some people say that the British Empire,
111280	118160	for example, was nothing but a litany of racism and economic exploitation and
119040	125840	wanton violence, I say to myself, well, it was all those things, but it was also the opposite.
126720	135760	So, part of the reason for writing the book was to inform a new generation of
135760	141440	Britons and Australians and Canadians and New Zealanders about the whole truth about their
141440	147120	colonial past, not just the politically partisan story. So that was one reason.
148880	153680	A second reason has to do with the fact that I'm actually Anglo-Scottish. I know that sound like
153680	160000	it. I sound only marginally more Scottish than you do, John. But I was born there. And if you
160000	163840	get me to say a word like Jerusalem, then it comes out. But otherwise, I sound English.
164800	172880	But what that meant was that when the referendum on Scottish independence was held in 2014,
174240	181840	I was a visceral anti-independence person because I've lived on both sides of the
181840	187680	border and I actually think the UK is important and valuable and it's important to keep it together.
187680	196880	But I noticed that some Scottish nationalists were justifying Scottish independence as a form of
196880	205600	kind of national self-purification in terms of Britain equals empire equals evil and Scotland's
206160	211440	separation from Britain and Britain's the UK's disillusion would be an act of kind of national
211520	217600	self-purification. And again, I thought to myself, well, that's just far too simplistic and as it
217600	225760	stands, it's just not true. And then more recently, particularly since the killing of George Floyd in
226640	231040	2020 in Minneapolis and the Black Lives Matter movement coming across the Atlantic here,
234560	240560	we've had an obsession with colonialism and British colonialism in particular.
241440	250080	And I've noticed that empire has been a feature of human history since almost the dawn of time.
251360	258320	People with non-white skins, Arabs, Indians, Comanche and others were doing empire long
258320	263760	before Europeans did it. Why the obsession with European empires? Why the fixation on British
263760	270240	empire? And I interpret it as being an assault on the record of the West. So for all those
270240	276400	reasons, partly historical, then in domestically British, political and then more broadly,
277360	281680	international politics. I wanted to write this book and to put the record straight.
282880	289360	It's a courageous thing to do because we live in such a sensorial age. And to defend Western
289360	297520	culture seems to be to invite, disdain and even cancellation. I understand you even had a bit
297520	306640	of trouble with your publisher or proposed publisher. Yes, I did. I was offered a contract
306640	313360	to write what was then called An Intelligent Person's Guide to Colonialism by Bloomsbury Publishing
313360	323040	in spring of 2018. I produced the manuscript at the end of 2020. The deadline was 31st of December.
323040	332480	I produced it at two o'clock on the 31st of December. And my commission editor read it and in
332480	338480	January he wrote back saying he was speechless with admiration at its rigor and comprehensiveness.
338480	343920	He said it was an important book and he predicted it would sell up to 20,000 copies.
344720	352320	And then it went into the copy editing process and they produced a cover. But then in March,
352320	358480	I got an email from the top of Bloomsbury saying that they were going to postpone publication
358480	366080	indefinitely because, to use their words, public feeling is unfavorable. And I was told informally
366080	371280	they wanted me to walk away from my contract. I could go into the gory detail and I'll spare you.
373440	382240	Suffice to say that eventually I, because I had no other choice, I agreed to walk away
382240	390720	from the contract without any other publisher in sight. That was in April 2021. Happily,
390720	394640	in August, 21, William Collins came to my rescue and they published the book
395440	400480	in this country and in Australia, I think, in early February and it came out in
400480	407280	Canada and the States last week. Well, I don't know what's happened to the idea that
408240	414480	we ought to have public debates, contestability of ideas, attempts to get to the truth of things,
415120	418080	but I find it a very, very disturbing development.
418080	423440	No, it was. And of course, when I realized they weren't going to publish it, I was momentarily
423440	428400	depressed, partly for personal reasons. But most of all, what depressed me was the thought
428400	434960	that we in Britain had come to the place where judging by what other people said of my work,
435040	440000	John, I'm pretty careful and I'm pretty thorough. And this topic was really important and my
440800	443920	commission editor said it was one of the most important books he'd seen in years.
444640	449920	And yet it seemed that this British publisher wouldn't publish it because public feeling was
449920	453840	unfavorable. Now, of course, we all know that public feeling is many things, there are many
453840	461200	public feelings, but part of the market, this publisher was scared of offending. And what
461200	470320	that implied for the future of a liberal free open society in this country really depressed me.
471440	476000	It's funny the little moments that make you stop and think it's not as straightforward
476000	484480	as the public mantra might have you believe. Seven or eight years ago, I had occasion to spend
484480	490480	some time in Myanmar, one time Burma. I met a very old man there. He said, you know,
490480	498000	I'm close to the end of my life. I've seen 90 years or so. And only one year of my 90,
498000	508640	did I feel safe and free in my own country. And I said, when was that? 1946. He said,
508640	518560	before that we had Japanese imperialism suffocating us the war. 1946, we were liberated.
518640	522960	And the British ran the place for a year. And I felt good and I felt safe.
523760	532160	Then my own people forced a repressive regime on me. These things are always much more complicated,
532160	539600	much more nuanced, always a story of good and bad. And that takes a lot of unpacking.
539600	544240	But can I ask you, let's be clear what you're talking about, your book is a scrutiny of our
544240	551840	current moral evaluations of colonialism. Yes. What would you describe as the colonialism
551840	558080	that you're writing about? And what sort of main countries have you sought to focus on?
559280	565600	So let me start with Empire, first of all, before I talk about colonialism. So
566400	572880	Empire is a form of political organization which has existed since the dawn of time,
572880	578320	whereby in an empire there are many peoples, but one people dominates, roughly speaking,
578320	588160	that's an empire. Now colonies are a form the empire can sometimes take when the dominant people
590080	597680	emigrate to other parts of the world and settle. So you have European British colonists in Australia,
597680	604720	you have European British colonists in North America. You don't have European British colonists
604720	612720	much in India during the British Empire. So there's a distinction between empire and colonies.
614400	618960	But broadly speaking, and I've used the word colonialism in the title of my book because
618960	626480	that's the one that's used in public discourse. But the book itself focuses on the record of the
626480	637040	British Empire. Why? Partly it's the one I know best. Partly it was the largest of the European
637040	647360	empires. And it's also the one that morphed to some extent into the post-Nahifa 5 American-led
647440	656160	international order. And so when I said earlier that I think that the attack on colonialism,
656880	663200	the attack on the British Empire is an attack on the record of the West, that's one reason why I
663200	669840	focused on it. One of the early claims you make in the book is that the colonial or so-called
669840	676320	colonial project was made up of both good and bad motives. No, the common narrative would be that
676320	683040	they couldn't possibly have been any good motives. I'd appreciate your views on that
683920	690800	preface of briefly by saying not long ago I met an Indian scholar who said to me that much of what
690800	698000	happened in India was very positive, which is surprising. It's not what young people particularly
698000	703440	will ever hear. How can there be good motives? No, indeed, indeed. Yes, you're right. So the assumption
703440	711200	is that empire is always about conquest and oppression and exploitation. But that is much more
711200	715680	to theory than it does to historical fact. So that's one reason why I prefer not to talk about
715680	722080	imperialism or colonialism, because that implies a kind of unitary thing. Whereas in fact,
722800	729040	I mean, maybe in Berlin in 1938, someone decided we'd go to conquer the world. But in the case of
729040	732560	the British Empire and most of the European emperors, it wasn't like that. It was much more ad
732640	739840	hoc, much more responding to circumstance. So how did the British Empire rise? Originally,
740720	749760	in the 1600s, trade. East India Company is given a monopoly of trade between England and India,
750320	761040	and Englishmen sail out to India and establish trading bases in India. Then Englishmen also go
761040	766720	westward across the Atlantic. Why do they do that? Well, partly because Elizabeth first wanted
769360	774080	sailors to harass Spanish shipping, because the Spanish Empire was threatening the Protestant
774080	781680	England. So the irony there is the origins of English Empire are anti-imperial. But to be honest,
781680	790560	also, people like Drake and others were hungry for gold. At the time, I don't think there were
790560	796080	particularly hungry for land, but they were hungry for gold. So you've got those in the early
797440	804000	century of the First British Empire. You have trade, anti-imperial national endeavour,
805040	812720	private hunger for gold. Later on, in the 19th century, the British, one reason the British
813280	820080	ever came to rule East Africa was lobbying by humanitarians to suppress the slave,
820080	828720	the Arab slave trade. And some parts of the empire landed in London at the end of wars
828720	834880	when they were ceded by treaty. So the motives were really quite various. Yes, they included
834880	841680	sometimes greed. They included sometimes racial arrogance. But oftentimes, I mean,
842560	849280	all human endeavour is a mixture of virtue and vice and good motives and bad.
850160	855200	Anyone reflecting on their own private lives knows that. And the imperial endeavour was no
855200	861520	different. We have lost sight of that, haven't we? I mean, we now tend to ascribe virtue
862160	869280	to one group versus another group in a very simplistic way. You disagree with me, so you're
869280	877200	bad and you're all bad. And I'm all right. And there's no allowing for vagraness in between.
878800	884320	Yeah, I think that's right. I mean, I speak as a Christian. The assumption that
884400	892800	virtue and vice runs right through the middle of me is one I long made, and I assume of everyone
892800	899440	else that we're a mixture of virtue and vice. One good effect of that view of the universality
899440	906480	of sinfulness is that when you do me wrong, John, I may be very annoyed and I may rightly
906480	912480	hold you to account for that. But the fact that I know that I, too, am a sinner means that my
912640	921200	judgment on you is tempered, because I, too, am a sinner. And so the sense that
922000	930320	unrighteousness is within here as well as out there actually helps to temper conflict between
931120	936080	individuals and between political parties and between nations. And frankly, a wider
936960	944080	awareness of that wisdom now might see a greater commitment to a more honest debate about issues
944080	949840	of the thought that we're talking today. I think so. Now, you say that colonialism can be said to
950880	959200	have a report card that shows some positives as well as some negatives. What are the negatives,
959200	967520	adversely, as you said? Yeah. So just taking the British Empire, for example,
970560	977040	in the debit column of the Imperial Ledger, you will find roughly 150 years worth of slave
977040	985520	trade and slavery from about 1650 to 1807. You will find, not uncommonly,
986080	997360	offensive racial arrogance. You will also find, very commonly, the abrupt disruption of
998480	1006560	social and cultural and economic lives of Native peoples in North America, Australia,
1006560	1013120	and Africa. The reason for that is that the cultural gap between, let's say,
1013120	1017280	19th century Europeans with their science and their medicine and their
1018080	1022560	ocean-going ships and their firearms, the cultural gap between them and many of the
1022560	1028160	peoples they met was just vast. So the impact of modernity, which was going to happen one way or
1028160	1043600	another, was severe. And the other major negative impact of European colonial expansion
1043600	1051920	was disease. I don't understand these things not being a medic, but I understand that because
1052000	1058880	Europeans had domesticated animals, they had become immune to diseases that animals can spread.
1059760	1067200	But when they went to North America, and not least Australia, they brought with them
1067840	1071280	diseases that Native peoples were not immune to and Native peoples suffered grievously.
1071920	1079520	That said, there is reason to suppose that smallpox was introduced to Northern Australia,
1079520	1084400	not by Europeans, but by fishermen from what's known in Indonesia. So it wasn't just the Europeans
1084400	1089680	who spread disease. And by the way, the disease were not spread deliberately, but it was a tragic
1089680	1102080	evil. Amongst the widely presented arguments that colonialism was evil is, of course, that it was
1102080	1109920	racist. But I think you challenge that assumption. It's not so simple. And indeed, you hold up the
1109920	1117920	very interesting illustration of British involvement in Africa to end slavery, which is deeply rooted
1117920	1125920	in the horrors of racism. So I think we need to have an adult discussion about what we mean
1125920	1131040	about racism, John. And there are a couple of pages in my book where I lay out what I think
1131040	1142320	racism is. And I take it to be, I mean, human beings are constantly in the business of identifying
1142320	1147040	with one group over and against another and thinking themselves, thinking this group,
1147040	1151920	to which I belong, this football club, this church, this nation, this race is better than
1151920	1157200	another, because it makes us feel better to be superior to other people. It's a very common thing.
1157760	1164880	Europeans did not invent racial prejudice. But I think that's what it is. It's denigrating another
1164880	1170960	people, another race, in an indiscriminate fashion, and then assuming that any member of that race
1171840	1177760	shares in whatever bad qualities you attributed to it. And that I regard just for the record is
1177760	1186320	ugly and it's abhorrent. But what I don't think is racist is making discriminate judgments about
1186320	1193360	another culture and saying, well, in this respect, I think that culture is scientifically or
1193360	1200800	technologically or perhaps even morally inferior. Now, why do I say that's not racist? Well, it's
1200800	1207200	partly because when I was a 21st century Britain, look back on my medieval forebears, you bet there
1207200	1215920	are ways in which I regard our culture of superior to theirs. We don't, thank goodness, hang, draw,
1215920	1223040	and quarter criminals. We don't burn them alive. Our medicine is superior. Our agriculture is superior.
1223920	1229440	So if I can say that about my own people a thousand years ago, if I meet other cultures
1229440	1235280	around the world which have similar practices or a similar level of cultural development,
1235360	1244800	I also regard them as, in these respects, inferior. And let's also point out that
1246560	1252480	people who regard themselves as progressive, when they regard, let's say, Christian fundamentalists
1252480	1260240	in the Southern United States, they regard them typically with contempt. So they regard their
1260240	1267200	progressive culture of superior to fundamentalist Christian culture. So my view is that needn't
1267200	1272880	be racist provided you're discriminates. You're not, as it were, indiscriminately
1272880	1279040	rubbishing of another culture. And the other important respect is this, that it would be racist
1280560	1288080	as some people toward the end of the 1800s thought to regard non-white peoples as naturally
1288080	1294560	or biologically inferior. Let's just say, not only are they at this moment in time inferior,
1294560	1299360	culturally in certain respects, but that's because they are naturally inferior and they will never
1300160	1307360	significantly improve. That view, as I said, was around in the late Victorian period,
1307360	1312160	but it never displaced the earlier Christian view. And this is the view that
1313040	1323200	fuels the very powerful and popular movement to abolish slavery, which gained momentum in
1323200	1329840	the late 1700s, the Christian view that all human beings are basically equal under God, regardless
1329840	1339280	of race, and regardless of cultural development. That view was not racist. The worst form of
1339280	1345680	race, as I think, is that which regards members of another race as naturally and permanently
1345680	1356880	and biologically inferior. That's insupportable. Often reminded, in my own mind, of the earliest
1356880	1365920	recognised political slogan that was struck by Josiah Wedgwood during the anti-slavery campaign.
1366640	1370320	You can still see examples of it everywhere, a very intricate,
1370320	1377520	beautifully made bas-relief of an African man looking imploringly up, and the slogan underneath
1377520	1387520	says, am I not a man and a brother? The insistence that our humanity is common, and they're not an
1387520	1393280	inferior species. So it was that Christian view that you'll find it at the beginning of
1393280	1398640	John Wesley's Thoughts Upon Slavery in 1774, and it was that Christian view that particularly
1398640	1404640	through evangelical Christianity, through Methodism, through non-conformist Christianity,
1404640	1410080	really became widespread in England in the late 1700s, early 1800s.
1410960	1416880	In America, in Canada, in New Zealand, in my own home country, Australia, the dispossession of
1416880	1425600	Native peoples, still widely discussed in terms of not only being a terrible thing, but sometimes
1425600	1432560	there's the hint that it was genocidal, that there was the intent to wipe out a people.
1434880	1441200	There's a proper reading of the historical record supports such a contention, that there was somehow
1441200	1446720	a premeditated intention to do away with people on the basis of race.
1448400	1458400	In my view, no. I mean, as you well know, the classic alleged example of genocide was what
1458400	1464640	happened in Tasmania in the 1830s and 40s. The Australian art critic, Robert Hughes, said that
1465280	1471440	that was kind of the one infamous example of genocide within the British Empire.
1472160	1480480	This, of course, is highly controversial, but my view that what happened in Tasmania
1480480	1487920	is not fairly described as genocide, is shared by Australian historians such as Henry Reynolds and
1487920	1496080	Dirk Moses, who rightly, I think, certainly Reynolds rightly says that we need to define genocide
1497040	1505440	as international law defines it, namely as an intentional and systematic attempt to exterminate
1505440	1511280	people. I mean, the paradigm of genocide is, of course, Hitler's final solution. Very deliberate,
1511520	1517680	state-sponsored, state-organized, and very systematic. That's the paradigm.
1518400	1524480	And nothing like that happened in Tasmania nor anywhere else in the British Empire. That's
1524480	1531280	not to say that there weren't settlers who were so hostile to native peoples that when they
1531280	1538000	encountered them, they tried to kill as many as they could. But from my reading of Australian
1538320	1551440	New Zealand, African and North American history, colonial government never sought to perpetrate
1551440	1558640	genocide. And on the contrary, colonial government strove to moderate the impact of settlers on
1558640	1563280	natives, particularly in the 1800s after they'd been this kind of moral revolution in England.
1563360	1568240	And again, evangelical Christianity was a major force here. Colonial government tried to
1568240	1576720	moderate the impact of settlers on natives and strove to restrain violence and to restrain
1576720	1584960	settler violence. So there was no systematic, state-sponsored attempt at exterminating people.
1585600	1592160	Although peoples were sometimes annihilated, almost invariably by disease. So the Bayo took
1592160	1599360	people of Newfoundland in what's now Canada in the 1700s, disappeared through a combination of
1599360	1606560	disease, warfare with other tribes, and the impact of Europeans. But again, it wasn't deliberate.
1607200	1612640	It's an important distinction to make, I think, between the actions of individuals
1613280	1618480	and what was sanctioned by the state and what was not. So I think of a horrendous massacre that
1618480	1627040	happened not far from where I live. And it was undertaken by a group of highly irresponsible
1627040	1635440	and very nasty Stockman. The state apparatus, if I can put it that way, slowly, and in a pretty
1635440	1644880	creaking way, nonetheless, actually assisted on justice. And nine perpetrators out of 11 people
1644880	1653360	involved, white men, were hung for what they had done quite early on. So the state, in a sense,
1655280	1664080	often not as effectively as it might have, but it did seek, in that case, to insist on justice,
1664080	1670160	to recognize that a white man, and this is the language that was sort of being used at the time,
1670160	1676000	who murdered a black man, should hang for it. Yes. So I think there's a, isn't there a cartoon that
1676000	1685120	Governor Arthur had put about, which was explaining in cartoon form to Aboriginal people that there
1685120	1690720	will be equal justice, that if a white man kills an aborigine, they tool that. That's correct.
1691520	1699600	But just on that, my perception is that in Australia and elsewhere,
1701760	1707360	if there was something to criticize about colonial government, it was too weak. It wasn't
1707360	1712400	powerful enough to control what was going on. But then I think we need to remember that
1713120	1720960	government in early 19th century Britain was small and weak. So when you've got famine in Ireland,
1720960	1726160	just across the Irish Sea, part of the problem is that the government doesn't have the resources
1727120	1736240	to deal with that problem adequately. And just in terms of personnel, I think around,
1736320	1746160	even as late as the 1880s in Canada, you have 1,000 Royal Canadian mounted police
1747120	1758080	patrolling the whole of Canada, 1,000 men, this vast territory. And I suspect in Australia
1758080	1763360	it was the same story, that the government didn't have the personnel, the army, the police
1764320	1767840	are sufficient to control what was going on in the frontiers, but they did their best.
1768880	1773760	No, you can't talk about the British Empire without considering India. And it's an interesting
1773760	1781040	case. It's a rising superpower. It's becoming the most populous nation on earth. It's a little
1781040	1787120	uncertain in its democracy at times, but it is a democracy. And I often think to myself
1787120	1798240	that it may not have been a democracy if Britain had not in the end shown them what democracy was.
1799120	1806400	The record's not all bad. They could have left a complete shambles and a dysfunctional state.
1809280	1816320	Yes. So what did the British do for India? First of all, they created it because when the British
1816320	1823840	arrived in India, in the subcontinent in the 1700s, it was a mosaic of different states,
1823840	1831040	different princely states speaking a variety of languages. And by the time the British left in
1831040	1839840	1947, sadly, British India was divided into Pakistan and India because of religious tensions.
1839840	1848160	But what was left of India was a very large unitary state in which English was widely spoken
1848160	1855760	at least at certain levels. So there was a linguistic coherence. And so insofar as India
1855760	1861680	now is thriving economically, the fact that there is a common language and a common state and a
1861680	1870960	common market must bear some large responsibility for that. But also in terms of the rule of law,
1872800	1880160	I mean, the Indian civil service under the British had reputation for very high integrity.
1881360	1887280	And I don't know to what extent the Indian civil service as it is now has maintained that tradition.
1888080	1893680	But if you want conditions for that are attractive to investors, then the rule of law,
1895600	1902000	a lack of corruption in government, a large common market, and a common language English
1902000	1908400	helps enormously is very attractive. So although it's true that the current
1910400	1915200	vigor of the Indian economy owes a lot to the abandonment of socialist policies, which the
1916160	1922480	immediate post independence Indian governments adopted. Nevertheless, the things the British
1922480	1928880	put in place that provide conditions for a vigorous economic life.
1929920	1934720	And it does raise the question, I think, as well. You often hear this story, this line that
1934720	1940000	the West is responsible for the dysfunctionality of former colonies today.
1940880	1950720	And it overlooks often what those countries or conglomeration of communities, which India was,
1950720	1958480	I suppose, what they were really like in terms of functionality prior to the involvement of the West.
1958480	1969360	One of the general benefits of Imperial authority is that it pacifies what would otherwise be
1970320	1976400	a multiplicity of warring peoples. And that was certainly the case in India when the East India
1976400	1984480	Company first landed there. Mughal Imperial authority had disintegrated and there was constant
1985200	1995040	civil wars among Indians. And one of the effects of the expansion of the rule of the East India
1995040	2003840	Company in the late 1700s was peace, and as a consequence of peace, economic prosperity.
2003840	2013360	So if one person I quote in my book, John Malcolm, a Scotsman born about 50 miles east of where I
2013360	2024000	was born, in fact, he was a founder member of the club in which we now sit. He went out to India in
2024000	2035120	about 1780 at the age of 13. And in the around 1800, he wrote about how because of the ending
2035120	2039760	of civil war and the imposition of British rule, the peasants were returning to the fields and
2039760	2047600	they were coming fertile again. So the imperial imposed peace has the benefit of allowing economic
2047600	2054080	life to flourish. And that was one of the benefits of the imposition of British imperial rule in
2054880	2062720	India. There's an interesting counter example in Southern Africa when in 1879 the British invaded
2062720	2070160	and conquered the Zulu Kingdom. And in order to break up its power because it was a highly
2070160	2075120	militarized society, the British broke up the Zulu Kingdom into about a dozen different little
2075120	2083760	kinglets. And sometime afterwards, some Zulu leaders were heard to complain. And they said,
2083760	2088240	you know, you British, you conquer us, we get the right of conquest. Fine, you get to rule us.
2088880	2093040	Now would you please do so? Because what you've done is you come here, you've conquered us,
2093040	2098080	you've broken us up. And because you haven't imposed your imperial authority, we're now quarreling
2098080	2105760	among one another. So again, sometimes the fault of imperial rule was it was sometimes too weak.
2106720	2113280	But when it's imposed, it has the benefit of creating peace and as a consequence of that
2113280	2121840	economic prosperity. Central to any account of colonialism is surely the importation of missionaries
2122480	2129680	and Christianity to non-Christian lands. What did you discover in your research in this area
2129680	2138800	about the relationship between Christianity and missionaries and colonialization?
2139600	2148320	So you're right, John, that Christianity became important for the empire around the end of the
2149280	2158320	1700s, early 1800s because of the evangelical awakening in England. And that fueled the
2160080	2164160	movement for the abolition of slavery. And then it fueled concern for the plight of
2164160	2169680	native peoples in likes of Australia and North America. So in that sense, it became
2170640	2182880	a central and important humanizing feature. But in one sense, early on, contrary to one myth about
2184160	2189440	colonialism, missionaries were not central to the project because
2191440	2197120	colonial officials often found missionaries to be a nuisance. Why were they a nuisance?
2197120	2202400	Well, because if you are Christian missionaries into India, for example, and they start to
2202400	2207920	proselytize and preach the gospel, then Indians get upset. And the colonial officials then have
2207920	2214000	to deal with the upset. So in fact, the East India Company banned missionaries until about the 1830s.
2215440	2222400	So it's not true to say that Christian missionaries were sent to the lap dogs of the tool of empire.
2222480	2230320	Far from it, and often you'd find missionaries in New Zealand or Africa and indeed Canada
2231840	2237680	lobbying the imperial government in London to constrain the actions of colonial governments
2237680	2246400	in the colonies. So missionaries could be pains in the backside to colonial governments
2246400	2253680	because they were critical and often humanitarian. Now it's often, it's sometimes often thought that
2254880	2262480	missionaries pushed Christianity down the throats of natives. Well, that wasn't true because missionaries
2262480	2271760	didn't have the power to do that. It is true, sadly, for example, in the residential schools in
2271760	2278080	Canada where native children were brought so they could learn English and agriculture. It is true
2278080	2286080	that sometimes missionaries were, Christian missionaries were too zealous and too dismissive of
2286080	2294960	native culture. So there was an element of cultural racism there, not always, but sometimes. But often
2294960	2304240	native peoples found Christianity attractive. So Ronald Hyam, who was an historian of the British
2304240	2311680	Empire, writes that in Africa, the Christian message of the brotherhood of humanity and
2311680	2320000	equality in Christ was naturally enormously attractive to people in the African margins,
2320960	2327120	young people, women trying, young women trying to avoid female circumcision slaves
2328160	2335680	and others. And so native people sometimes found Christianity very attractive. They adopted it,
2336400	2341200	they adopted it, but they also, you know, what they adopted, they also changed and adapted. So
2342000	2349200	Africa and Christianity found African expression for Christianity too. So there isn't
2349280	2353760	any relationship between Christianity and native peoples was a very mixed one and also
2354400	2359520	between colonial authorities and missions was a very mixed one. But it's certainly not true to
2359520	2366160	think of Christian missions as simply an extension of colonial oppression that's far too simplistic.
2367280	2373520	What do we know about the distinctive approaches to colonisation by the different nations that
2373520	2379840	engaged in it? Well, it wasn't just the British, the French, the Spanish, the Dutch, the Germans.
2381280	2383600	They had different approaches. There were different outcomes.
2385840	2391200	What did you find there? And what were the driving influences for their different approaches?
2391200	2398000	Yes. To be frank, John, I don't, I can't claim to know enough about other European
2398000	2405360	empires. I know something. So, you know, if you're an expert, compare us and go to
2406160	2412480	Crescent Kumar's book, Visions of Empire, a very good book published about eight years ago.
2413120	2420400	But here are some things I have picked up. I think on the negative side, I think
2421200	2429040	the British were more reluctant to allow native peoples, native elites, into the top echelons
2429040	2436240	of government. So in India, for example, yes, Indians were involved in governing other Indians,
2436240	2442880	but not right at the top. I had the impression the French in Africa were better at integrating
2442880	2448560	elites into the top. And in that respect, I think the French did better.
2453120	2461600	On the other hand, the British tended to adhere to the liberal principle that
2462640	2467600	colonies should become increasingly independent. And as you well know, partly because the British
2467600	2472560	learnt from the American War of Independence, you can't keep tight control of colonies at the far
2472560	2477120	end of the world, particularly when you take months to communicate with them. And so starting
2477120	2482800	with Canada in the 1960s, and then Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa by the 1930s are
2482800	2488880	virtually independent. And they have, I think, common, some common defence policies. And India's
2488880	2496240	on the same track after the First World War. So the model of the British model of empire was
2496240	2500640	really a kind of relaxing into a commonwealth of nations. And that phrase is used as early as the
2500640	2507440	First World War, whereas the French had a model of, were integrating the colonies into France.
2508080	2514320	And so to this day, French overseas territories send representatives to the Assemblee National
2514320	2522480	in France. So that was another difference. And then a third point would be, whereas the British
2523600	2530320	decided to devote their imperial power in part to the abolition of slavery all of the world,
2530400	2538320	so yes, the British were involved in slave trading and slavery from 1650 to about to the 1800s. But
2538320	2545680	then from the early 1800s onwards, the empire for the second half of its life was committed to
2545680	2551600	abolishing slavery from Brazil across Africa, India, and Malaysia. And that also included
2551920	2560720	abolishing slavery in South Africa, which the British took over from the Dutch around 1804,
2560720	2568640	I think, because the Dutch had been importing slaves from Malaysia into South Africa. And for
2568640	2579360	that reason, some Dutch Africanas, or became known as Boers, meaning farmer, they were so
2580000	2586320	upset at the British suppression of slavery that they left Cape Colony, which the British controlled,
2586320	2591600	and created their own African Republics, the Transvaal and the Orange Free State.
2592720	2600720	So on that point, Dutch colonists and British colonialism differed in terms of the treatment
2600720	2608160	of Native Africans. And that was why when the Second Anglo-Bore War broke out in 1899,
2609120	2613280	black Africans as well as black African Americans tended to support the British.
2614400	2621760	I think there's often an assumption that colonisation involved great cruelty and violence,
2624000	2629120	that it was about military takeovers, if you like, and the squashing of people.
2630640	2636240	I don't think it's as simple as that. I think, as you've said, there were various motives,
2636320	2639440	various different approaches taken at various times by the British.
2641040	2647040	But I also wonder whether the sort of policies that different countries ran
2648640	2655360	reflected different ideas about treating Indigenous people decently.
2658240	2665520	So there's no doubt, John, that in the history of the British Empire, there's a lot of violence.
2666720	2673680	But we need to put that in context because you and I are privileged to live in parts of the
2673680	2683520	world that enjoy unprecedented peace and health and wealth and security. And we live in countries
2683520	2688400	that have strong states that can afford to be very careful about how much violence they use,
2688400	2693520	because they don't have to use too much of it. But in the past, where states,
2694480	2703360	colonial governments are weak, where borders are uncertain, there was a lot of conflict,
2703360	2711600	a lot of violence. But the past was just, it was much more insecure. And where people are insecure,
2712800	2716560	they don't give other benefits of doubt and there's more violence. So let's just take that as red.
2717680	2722400	How did the British Empire compare to other empires in terms of violence? Well,
2724240	2729680	to take one infamous case, you've got the Belgian Empire and the Congo, which,
2731520	2739040	colony in the Congo, which was notoriously cruel to black Africans. Although to be fair,
2739040	2745280	as I understand it, that wasn't actually a colony of the Belgian state. It was actually
2745280	2751440	a private fiefdom of King Leopold. So you might want to say that was the Belgian
2751440	2759280	support of just the kings. That's a fine point. Then the other allegedly notoriously
2763120	2771760	cruel expression of European colonialism was in German South East Africa,
2772880	2780000	where it is widely supposed that the Germans perpetrated a genocide there.
2780000	2784640	Now that's controversial. I have a colleague and friend to the right of me, Bruce Gilley,
2784640	2789040	who was argued forcefully that that wasn't the case, but it's widely held to be the case.
2790560	2800640	And then you've got the Japanese when they invaded China, famously the rape of Nanjing or
2800640	2807600	Nanking, where no one knows how many, but several hundred thousand Chinese civilians were killed
2807600	2813920	by Japanese troops. And it is notable therefore that in the Second World War,
2816320	2825200	probably the greatest, yes without a doubt, the greatest number of troops in the British
2825200	2833280	Empire were Indian. And Indian troops were all volunteers. And although Indian troops were
2833360	2839920	deployed in North Africa and in Italy during the Second World War, most of them were fighting
2839920	2847600	the Japanese in Burma and India. And they chose to fight with the British against the Japanese. Why?
2848800	2851920	Not because they wanted the British to stay and rule them forever,
2853840	2857280	but they sure as damn didn't want the Japanese to rule them because they read the papers,
2857280	2865040	they heard the reports of what the Japanese did in China in Manchuria. And compared to the
2865040	2874320	Japanese, the British were to Indians at that time far preferable. And as I said, as we discussed
2874320	2880160	earlier, I don't think the British were responsible for perpetrating genocide in Tasmania or anywhere
2880160	2888480	else. Whereas it seems that in some cases, European empires did commit genocide.
2890880	2897920	So we hear endlessly that there are endless negatives about what Britain in particular
2897920	2904320	has done in the rest of the world in the name of colonialism. And you've been very honest about
2904320	2912880	some of those failings. Can we get a handle on the good news, the positives, as you discover them
2912880	2920320	to be? Yeah. So in the conclusion to my book, I draw up two lists of, I draw up as it were,
2920320	2925120	the debit column in the ledger and then the credit column. The credit column is actually longer.
2926880	2931280	So here are some of the items in the credit ledger. We talked about anti-slavery and this was a
2931840	2936400	consistent policy for 150 years for the second half of the empire's life.
2939040	2946400	There was also the imposition of peace, I mentioned. Native peoples did benefit from
2947040	2954560	the imposition of a pure authority which subdued warfare between natives.
2955520	2964640	There was also the establishment of the rule of law. I was in Shanghai in China a few years ago and
2965280	2970560	met a young couple from Singapore. And as soon as Daniel had introduced himself to me, he said,
2971600	2975920	any prompting, he said, we in Singapore are grateful to you, British, for the rule of law.
2976320	2986800	And another anecdote I have related to that is I had a Chinese colleague from Hong Kong visiting
2986800	2997440	me in Oxford and I said to him, so, Pingchong, what do you think about the British legacy,
2998240	3006640	the colonial legacy in Hong Kong? And he said, well, if in the 1950s or 60s,
3006640	3013040	China had been a liberal democracy, Hong Kong wouldn't look so good. But in the 50s, late 50s,
3013680	3021440	early 50s, China was in a state of anarchy and civil war and that's why you had a million or two
3021440	3028320	Chinese, no one knows how many, fleeing mainland China, coming into the non-democratic colony of
3028320	3036480	Hong Kong. Why? Because at least there there was the rule of law which provides life with
3036480	3041920	predictability and you can at least have sufficient stability to flourish there.
3042640	3046160	So the establishment of the rule of law was really important, very important for foreign
3046160	3053760	investment. The British up until 1929, I think, invested more overseas than any other European
3053760	3060240	country and investors don't invest unless the environment is secure, because otherwise they
3060240	3066320	risk losing their investment. So the establishment of the rule of law stable government encouraged
3066320	3075120	investment in India and Africa and Australia and North America. And not least thanks to that,
3077440	3088640	look at what the British Empire grew up. So the United States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand
3089520	3096080	and indeed Israel, some of the most prosperous, stable liberal countries in the world, all of them
3097040	3106720	were progeny of the British Empire. So I think there are quite a large number of benefits that
3106720	3115600	the Empire conferred upon various parts of the world. He's a novel thought. There are probably
3117360	3125200	not a few people who wouldn't mind a little British rule of law today. Yes, in the sense that
3126080	3132480	we hear endless condemnation of Britain in relation to the slave trade, but nobody seems
3132480	3140320	to care about the 45 to 50 million slaves around the world today. Yes. It says something very
3140320	3145360	profound that we want to revisit the past, whereas in fact the story there is not as people believe
3145360	3152800	it and ignore the fact that there's a great need for people to stand up now as the anti-slavery
3152800	3158320	campaigners in Britain did so effectively a couple of hundred years ago. No, that's absolutely
3158320	3165040	right. And let's be clear, the reason why some people wanted to focus on the sins of slavery,
3165040	3172480	which were sins, is political. And people wanted to focus on the evils of colonialism because it is
3172480	3182560	politically useful as a kind of lever to achieve things politically. But the whole truth is all
3182560	3187520	together more mixed. And I think it's really important politically we get our history right,
3187520	3195760	otherwise we're susceptible to false guilt and we embark on well-meaning but ill-judged policies.
3195760	3204240	So let's get the history right. We live in a culture now where there's an extraordinary,
3204240	3217760	almost self-loathing of everything that we are and a quite noticeable manipulation of history
3218640	3225120	to support a narrative that we should be ashamed of what has gone before us.
3226480	3229680	And I think that is playing out very badly for young people.
3229680	3239520	What advice would you give that's a sort of a question from left field to parents and influencers
3239520	3250960	and so forth when it comes to trying to help their children develop a more balanced approach,
3250960	3255280	because it seems to be critically important to me. The point you made earlier, we're all a mixture
3255280	3260800	of good and bad. It's never as simple as black and white. And if you believe it is, you fall
3260800	3265840	under this terrible trap of thinking the world is just, life is just one long battle between good
3265840	3271680	people and bad people. Yes. And if you believe the story is told about our colonial past,
3271680	3276320	then it was nothing but a litany of racism and oppression and violence. And that has to shake
3276320	3284320	your confidence in the nation states and the institutions that we built. Everything comes
3284720	3294000	under question because our states were involved in this imperial oppression and wickedness.
3294720	3299120	So it's really important that the whole truth be told and the whole truth is that the British
3299120	3304080	Empire, for example, did some very good things as well as some very bad things.
3305760	3310160	And so what advice will I give? Well, obviously the first piece of advice I give is read my book,
3310960	3317440	because even if you don't agree with the moral argument I make, and I try at the end of the
3317440	3323600	book to come to an overall judgment about the British Empire morally, even if you don't agree
3323600	3328400	with that, in the course of the book, you will learn a lot about what actually happened.
3329680	3339200	And part of the problem today, the reason why this relentlessly negative reading of our
3339840	3345760	colonial past has taken root, particularly in the educated elite and the media institutions,
3346480	3352480	is that no one knows the history. So if activists come along and say it was all racism and genocide,
3353040	3359120	no one knows enough to contradict them. So my first piece of advice is a part of parents of
3359120	3365360	teachers read something, read my book. The other book I'd recommend is Neil Ferguson's
3366320	3372880	book entitled Simply Empire, published 20 years ago. I re-read it recently. It's still good,
3372880	3380400	and besides, unlike mine, it's got pictures. So do that. The other resource would be the
3380400	3386480	website of a body called History Reclaimed, which is based in this country. It's run by Robert
3386560	3391520	Toomes out of Cambridge University, or it's not a Cambridge University
3393920	3402080	entity, but he's at Cambridge and he runs it. And this is designed to get historians to write
3402080	3408400	material that is more balanced and provides the other side of the story. And there's lots of
3408400	3415920	stuff up on the website. So I'd really recommend that parents and teachers of history look at
3415920	3424640	that website, which is universally available. I put a proposition to you, then, and just to test it.
3426400	3431840	You could argue that the means by which Britain became the most powerful nation on Earth, as it
3431840	3438080	was for a very long time, contained some bad stories as well as some good stories and some
3438080	3445440	indifferent stories. But it needs to be balanced by the reality that then Britain became the
3445440	3452160	first and only empire of its type to actually abolish slavery, so far as I'm aware. And it was
3452160	3459520	able to take on the role of ending it beyond its own economy and peoples because it was big and
3459520	3468880	powerful. So there's two sides to that one story alone. Yes. So Britain was not the first to
3468880	3474320	abolish the safer Denmark was, but in Northwest Europe, you have a number of nations that come
3474320	3480400	to the view for the first time in the history of the world that slavery as such is unacceptable.
3481280	3486800	And then Britain, because after the end of the Napoleonic wars in the 15th, Britain then becomes
3486800	3492560	for a century, or just over a century, the most powerful nation in the world. Britain devotes
3493840	3498800	a lot of its imperial power to suppressing slavery across the world. In the 1820s and 30s,
3498800	3504160	the slave trade department was the largest in the British Foreign Office. Around 1840,
3504160	3510560	50, the Royal Navy devoted 13% of its total manpower just as oppressing the slave trade across
3510560	3517120	the Atlantic from West Africa to the Americas. So there's that. There's also the fact that,
3518000	3525600	as I said earlier, the British realized, or some British realized that the empire could not consist
3525600	3533920	of a tightly controlled centralized state. So the Britain tightly controls the destinies of
3533920	3542400	peoples in Australia and Africa and North America. And so there was a recognition. And in fact,
3542400	3550400	in the 1820s and in India, Bombay and Calcutta and Madras are all governed by Scotsman. And every
3550400	3555040	one of the Scotsman says, folks, we can't be here forever. All we can hope to do
3555920	3562000	is to help the Indians develop decent government, and then we should leave with grace and hopefully
3562000	3567760	good will. And that view was embodied in the developing Commonwealth idea, as I said earlier,
3567760	3572480	whereby the empire relaxes into a family of independent nations, which is what it's become.
3573440	3578320	And I think that stands to that's the kind of liberal, a liberal vision of the destiny of
3578320	3582480	empire. And that, I think, is creditable. And then the last thing I'd say is,
3584960	3594640	remember how the British Empire exhausted itself. 1939 to 45. Doing what? Fighting the massively
3594640	3602480	murderous racist regime in Hitler's Berlin. And between May 1941, France fell, and June
3603440	3609840	June 41, when Hitler invaded Russia, the British Empire offered the only military
3609840	3616160	resistance to Nazism with the solo exception of Greece. And that has to say something good
3616160	3620160	about what the empire had become and what, when push came to shove, what it stood for.
3621760	3627040	To its end, like every political body, it contained both good and bad, virtual advice.
3627840	3634560	But I think the fact that, thanks to the moral integrity and wisdom of Winston Churchill,
3635360	3640560	Britain and the empire, and you know very well, and we British know now too,
3641280	3647120	the efforts to defeat Hitler was an imperial effort. Your father was North Africa, mine was in
3647120	3653360	Italy. He was mistaken for an Indian because the Indian division was off to his right in Italy,
3653360	3660560	not India. It was a remarkable multinational effort. And that was devoted to defeating,
3660560	3667680	not only Imperial Japan, but also Nazi Germany. And that, I think, if you're going to lose an
3667680	3674560	empire, I can't think of a better way to do it. Well, thank you very much. That's a great note
3674560	3681840	to end on. We need to recognise that history can teach us a great deal, but we need to know what
3681840	3695360	the history actually is. Absolutely. So please read my book.
