1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,160
Colonial government never sought to perpetuate genocide, and on the contrary a colonial government

2
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:13,920
strove to moderate the impact of settlers on natives, particularly in the 1800s,

3
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:18,720
after there had been this kind of moral revolution in England. And again, even Joe Christianity was

4
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:24,000
a major force here. Colonial government tried to moderate the impact of settlers on natives

5
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:27,280
and strove to to to restrain violence.

6
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:43,280
Nigel Bigger, who I count a friend and has been with us on this program before,

7
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:49,760
is Emeritus Regis Professor of Moral and Pastoral Theology at the University of Oxford.

8
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:55,840
His most recent book is Colonialism, a Moral Reckoning.

9
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:58,320
Nigel, thank you so much for joining us.

10
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:00,480
My pleasure to be back again, John.

11
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:05,840
Now, the many things that someone with your extensive list of qualifications and background

12
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:14,080
could have chosen to do, you've written a book about colonialism. Why? And you argue that it's not

13
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:19,600
the original sin, as some people say, it is of countries like Britain.

14
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:28,000
So, John, that's a good question. And the first thing I'd say is, I've been reading,

15
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:35,280
although I'm a theologian and an ethicist professionally, my first love was always history

16
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:40,960
and my preferred reading is history. And I've been reading about, in particular, British imperial

17
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:51,280
history for 20, 30 years. And so in recent times, when some people say that the British Empire,

18
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:58,160
for example, was nothing but a litany of racism and economic exploitation and

19
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:05,840
wanton violence, I say to myself, well, it was all those things, but it was also the opposite.

20
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:15,760
So, part of the reason for writing the book was to inform a new generation of

21
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:21,440
Britons and Australians and Canadians and New Zealanders about the whole truth about their

22
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:27,120
colonial past, not just the politically partisan story. So that was one reason.

23
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:33,680
A second reason has to do with the fact that I'm actually Anglo-Scottish. I know that sound like

24
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:40,000
it. I sound only marginally more Scottish than you do, John. But I was born there. And if you

25
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,840
get me to say a word like Jerusalem, then it comes out. But otherwise, I sound English.

26
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:52,880
But what that meant was that when the referendum on Scottish independence was held in 2014,

27
00:02:54,240 --> 00:03:01,840
I was a visceral anti-independence person because I've lived on both sides of the

28
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:07,680
border and I actually think the UK is important and valuable and it's important to keep it together.

29
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:16,880
But I noticed that some Scottish nationalists were justifying Scottish independence as a form of

30
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:25,600
kind of national self-purification in terms of Britain equals empire equals evil and Scotland's

31
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:31,440
separation from Britain and Britain's the UK's disillusion would be an act of kind of national

32
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:37,600
self-purification. And again, I thought to myself, well, that's just far too simplistic and as it

33
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:45,760
stands, it's just not true. And then more recently, particularly since the killing of George Floyd in

34
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:51,040
2020 in Minneapolis and the Black Lives Matter movement coming across the Atlantic here,

35
00:03:54,560 --> 00:04:00,560
we've had an obsession with colonialism and British colonialism in particular.

36
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:10,080
And I've noticed that empire has been a feature of human history since almost the dawn of time.

37
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:18,320
People with non-white skins, Arabs, Indians, Comanche and others were doing empire long

38
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:23,760
before Europeans did it. Why the obsession with European empires? Why the fixation on British

39
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:30,240
empire? And I interpret it as being an assault on the record of the West. So for all those

40
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:36,400
reasons, partly historical, then in domestically British, political and then more broadly,

41
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:41,680
international politics. I wanted to write this book and to put the record straight.

42
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:49,360
It's a courageous thing to do because we live in such a sensorial age. And to defend Western

43
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:57,520
culture seems to be to invite, disdain and even cancellation. I understand you even had a bit

44
00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:06,640
of trouble with your publisher or proposed publisher. Yes, I did. I was offered a contract

45
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:13,360
to write what was then called An Intelligent Person's Guide to Colonialism by Bloomsbury Publishing

46
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:23,040
in spring of 2018. I produced the manuscript at the end of 2020. The deadline was 31st of December.

47
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:32,480
I produced it at two o'clock on the 31st of December. And my commission editor read it and in

48
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:38,480
January he wrote back saying he was speechless with admiration at its rigor and comprehensiveness.

49
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:43,920
He said it was an important book and he predicted it would sell up to 20,000 copies.

50
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:52,320
And then it went into the copy editing process and they produced a cover. But then in March,

51
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:58,480
I got an email from the top of Bloomsbury saying that they were going to postpone publication

52
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:06,080
indefinitely because, to use their words, public feeling is unfavorable. And I was told informally

53
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:11,280
they wanted me to walk away from my contract. I could go into the gory detail and I'll spare you.

54
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:22,240
Suffice to say that eventually I, because I had no other choice, I agreed to walk away

55
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:30,720
from the contract without any other publisher in sight. That was in April 2021. Happily,

56
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:34,640
in August, 21, William Collins came to my rescue and they published the book

57
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:40,480
in this country and in Australia, I think, in early February and it came out in

58
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:47,280
Canada and the States last week. Well, I don't know what's happened to the idea that

59
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:54,480
we ought to have public debates, contestability of ideas, attempts to get to the truth of things,

60
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:58,080
but I find it a very, very disturbing development.

61
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:03,440
No, it was. And of course, when I realized they weren't going to publish it, I was momentarily

62
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:08,400
depressed, partly for personal reasons. But most of all, what depressed me was the thought

63
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:14,960
that we in Britain had come to the place where judging by what other people said of my work,

64
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:20,000
John, I'm pretty careful and I'm pretty thorough. And this topic was really important and my

65
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:23,920
commission editor said it was one of the most important books he'd seen in years.

66
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:29,920
And yet it seemed that this British publisher wouldn't publish it because public feeling was

67
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:33,840
unfavorable. Now, of course, we all know that public feeling is many things, there are many

68
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:41,200
public feelings, but part of the market, this publisher was scared of offending. And what

69
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:50,320
that implied for the future of a liberal free open society in this country really depressed me.

70
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:56,000
It's funny the little moments that make you stop and think it's not as straightforward

71
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:04,480
as the public mantra might have you believe. Seven or eight years ago, I had occasion to spend

72
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:10,480
some time in Myanmar, one time Burma. I met a very old man there. He said, you know,

73
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:18,000
I'm close to the end of my life. I've seen 90 years or so. And only one year of my 90,

74
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:28,640
did I feel safe and free in my own country. And I said, when was that? 1946. He said,

75
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:38,560
before that we had Japanese imperialism suffocating us the war. 1946, we were liberated.

76
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:42,960
And the British ran the place for a year. And I felt good and I felt safe.

77
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:52,160
Then my own people forced a repressive regime on me. These things are always much more complicated,

78
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:59,600
much more nuanced, always a story of good and bad. And that takes a lot of unpacking.

79
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:04,240
But can I ask you, let's be clear what you're talking about, your book is a scrutiny of our

80
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:11,840
current moral evaluations of colonialism. Yes. What would you describe as the colonialism

81
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:18,080
that you're writing about? And what sort of main countries have you sought to focus on?

82
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:25,600
So let me start with Empire, first of all, before I talk about colonialism. So

83
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:32,880
Empire is a form of political organization which has existed since the dawn of time,

84
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:38,320
whereby in an empire there are many peoples, but one people dominates, roughly speaking,

85
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:48,160
that's an empire. Now colonies are a form the empire can sometimes take when the dominant people

86
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:57,680
emigrate to other parts of the world and settle. So you have European British colonists in Australia,

87
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:04,720
you have European British colonists in North America. You don't have European British colonists

88
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:12,720
much in India during the British Empire. So there's a distinction between empire and colonies.

89
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:18,960
But broadly speaking, and I've used the word colonialism in the title of my book because

90
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:26,480
that's the one that's used in public discourse. But the book itself focuses on the record of the

91
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:37,040
British Empire. Why? Partly it's the one I know best. Partly it was the largest of the European

92
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:47,360
empires. And it's also the one that morphed to some extent into the post-Nahifa 5 American-led

93
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:56,160
international order. And so when I said earlier that I think that the attack on colonialism,

94
00:10:56,880 --> 00:11:03,200
the attack on the British Empire is an attack on the record of the West, that's one reason why I

95
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:09,840
focused on it. One of the early claims you make in the book is that the colonial or so-called

96
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:16,320
colonial project was made up of both good and bad motives. No, the common narrative would be that

97
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:23,040
they couldn't possibly have been any good motives. I'd appreciate your views on that

98
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:30,800
preface of briefly by saying not long ago I met an Indian scholar who said to me that much of what

99
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:38,000
happened in India was very positive, which is surprising. It's not what young people particularly

100
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:43,440
will ever hear. How can there be good motives? No, indeed, indeed. Yes, you're right. So the assumption

101
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:51,200
is that empire is always about conquest and oppression and exploitation. But that is much more

102
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:55,680
to theory than it does to historical fact. So that's one reason why I prefer not to talk about

103
00:11:55,680 --> 00:12:02,080
imperialism or colonialism, because that implies a kind of unitary thing. Whereas in fact,

104
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:09,040
I mean, maybe in Berlin in 1938, someone decided we'd go to conquer the world. But in the case of

105
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:12,560
the British Empire and most of the European emperors, it wasn't like that. It was much more ad

106
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:19,840
hoc, much more responding to circumstance. So how did the British Empire rise? Originally,

107
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:29,760
in the 1600s, trade. East India Company is given a monopoly of trade between England and India,

108
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:41,040
and Englishmen sail out to India and establish trading bases in India. Then Englishmen also go

109
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:46,720
westward across the Atlantic. Why do they do that? Well, partly because Elizabeth first wanted

110
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:54,080
sailors to harass Spanish shipping, because the Spanish Empire was threatening the Protestant

111
00:12:54,080 --> 00:13:01,680
England. So the irony there is the origins of English Empire are anti-imperial. But to be honest,

112
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:10,560
also, people like Drake and others were hungry for gold. At the time, I don't think there were

113
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:16,080
particularly hungry for land, but they were hungry for gold. So you've got those in the early

114
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:24,000
century of the First British Empire. You have trade, anti-imperial national endeavour,

115
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:32,720
private hunger for gold. Later on, in the 19th century, the British, one reason the British

116
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:40,080
ever came to rule East Africa was lobbying by humanitarians to suppress the slave,

117
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:48,720
the Arab slave trade. And some parts of the empire landed in London at the end of wars

118
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:54,880
when they were ceded by treaty. So the motives were really quite various. Yes, they included

119
00:13:54,880 --> 00:14:01,680
sometimes greed. They included sometimes racial arrogance. But oftentimes, I mean,

120
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:09,280
all human endeavour is a mixture of virtue and vice and good motives and bad.

121
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:15,200
Anyone reflecting on their own private lives knows that. And the imperial endeavour was no

122
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:21,520
different. We have lost sight of that, haven't we? I mean, we now tend to ascribe virtue

123
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:29,280
to one group versus another group in a very simplistic way. You disagree with me, so you're

124
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:37,200
bad and you're all bad. And I'm all right. And there's no allowing for vagraness in between.

125
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:44,320
Yeah, I think that's right. I mean, I speak as a Christian. The assumption that

126
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:52,800
virtue and vice runs right through the middle of me is one I long made, and I assume of everyone

127
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:59,440
else that we're a mixture of virtue and vice. One good effect of that view of the universality

128
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:06,480
of sinfulness is that when you do me wrong, John, I may be very annoyed and I may rightly

129
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:12,480
hold you to account for that. But the fact that I know that I, too, am a sinner means that my

130
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:21,200
judgment on you is tempered, because I, too, am a sinner. And so the sense that

131
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:30,320
unrighteousness is within here as well as out there actually helps to temper conflict between

132
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:36,080
individuals and between political parties and between nations. And frankly, a wider

133
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:44,080
awareness of that wisdom now might see a greater commitment to a more honest debate about issues

134
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:49,840
of the thought that we're talking today. I think so. Now, you say that colonialism can be said to

135
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:59,200
have a report card that shows some positives as well as some negatives. What are the negatives,

136
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:07,520
adversely, as you said? Yeah. So just taking the British Empire, for example,

137
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:17,040
in the debit column of the Imperial Ledger, you will find roughly 150 years worth of slave

138
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:25,520
trade and slavery from about 1650 to 1807. You will find, not uncommonly,

139
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:37,360
offensive racial arrogance. You will also find, very commonly, the abrupt disruption of

140
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:46,560
social and cultural and economic lives of Native peoples in North America, Australia,

141
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:53,120
and Africa. The reason for that is that the cultural gap between, let's say,

142
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:57,280
19th century Europeans with their science and their medicine and their

143
00:16:58,080 --> 00:17:02,560
ocean-going ships and their firearms, the cultural gap between them and many of the

144
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:08,160
peoples they met was just vast. So the impact of modernity, which was going to happen one way or

145
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:23,600
another, was severe. And the other major negative impact of European colonial expansion

146
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:31,920
was disease. I don't understand these things not being a medic, but I understand that because

147
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:38,880
Europeans had domesticated animals, they had become immune to diseases that animals can spread.

148
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:47,200
But when they went to North America, and not least Australia, they brought with them

149
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:51,280
diseases that Native peoples were not immune to and Native peoples suffered grievously.

150
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:59,520
That said, there is reason to suppose that smallpox was introduced to Northern Australia,

151
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:04,400
not by Europeans, but by fishermen from what's known in Indonesia. So it wasn't just the Europeans

152
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:09,680
who spread disease. And by the way, the disease were not spread deliberately, but it was a tragic

153
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:22,080
evil. Amongst the widely presented arguments that colonialism was evil is, of course, that it was

154
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:29,920
racist. But I think you challenge that assumption. It's not so simple. And indeed, you hold up the

155
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:37,920
very interesting illustration of British involvement in Africa to end slavery, which is deeply rooted

156
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:45,920
in the horrors of racism. So I think we need to have an adult discussion about what we mean

157
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:51,040
about racism, John. And there are a couple of pages in my book where I lay out what I think

158
00:18:51,040 --> 00:19:02,320
racism is. And I take it to be, I mean, human beings are constantly in the business of identifying

159
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:07,040
with one group over and against another and thinking themselves, thinking this group,

160
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:11,920
to which I belong, this football club, this church, this nation, this race is better than

161
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:17,200
another, because it makes us feel better to be superior to other people. It's a very common thing.

162
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:24,880
Europeans did not invent racial prejudice. But I think that's what it is. It's denigrating another

163
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:30,960
people, another race, in an indiscriminate fashion, and then assuming that any member of that race

164
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:37,760
shares in whatever bad qualities you attributed to it. And that I regard just for the record is

165
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:46,320
ugly and it's abhorrent. But what I don't think is racist is making discriminate judgments about

166
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:53,360
another culture and saying, well, in this respect, I think that culture is scientifically or

167
00:19:53,360 --> 00:20:00,800
technologically or perhaps even morally inferior. Now, why do I say that's not racist? Well, it's

168
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:07,200
partly because when I was a 21st century Britain, look back on my medieval forebears, you bet there

169
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:15,920
are ways in which I regard our culture of superior to theirs. We don't, thank goodness, hang, draw,

170
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:23,040
and quarter criminals. We don't burn them alive. Our medicine is superior. Our agriculture is superior.

171
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:29,440
So if I can say that about my own people a thousand years ago, if I meet other cultures

172
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:35,280
around the world which have similar practices or a similar level of cultural development,

173
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:44,800
I also regard them as, in these respects, inferior. And let's also point out that

174
00:20:46,560 --> 00:20:52,480
people who regard themselves as progressive, when they regard, let's say, Christian fundamentalists

175
00:20:52,480 --> 00:21:00,240
in the Southern United States, they regard them typically with contempt. So they regard their

176
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:07,200
progressive culture of superior to fundamentalist Christian culture. So my view is that needn't

177
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:12,880
be racist provided you're discriminates. You're not, as it were, indiscriminately

178
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:19,040
rubbishing of another culture. And the other important respect is this, that it would be racist

179
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:28,080
as some people toward the end of the 1800s thought to regard non-white peoples as naturally

180
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:34,560
or biologically inferior. Let's just say, not only are they at this moment in time inferior,

181
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:39,360
culturally in certain respects, but that's because they are naturally inferior and they will never

182
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:47,360
significantly improve. That view, as I said, was around in the late Victorian period,

183
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:52,160
but it never displaced the earlier Christian view. And this is the view that

184
00:21:53,040 --> 00:22:03,200
fuels the very powerful and popular movement to abolish slavery, which gained momentum in

185
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:09,840
the late 1700s, the Christian view that all human beings are basically equal under God, regardless

186
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:19,280
of race, and regardless of cultural development. That view was not racist. The worst form of

187
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:25,680
race, as I think, is that which regards members of another race as naturally and permanently

188
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:36,880
and biologically inferior. That's insupportable. Often reminded, in my own mind, of the earliest

189
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:45,920
recognised political slogan that was struck by Josiah Wedgwood during the anti-slavery campaign.

190
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:50,320
You can still see examples of it everywhere, a very intricate,

191
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:57,520
beautifully made bas-relief of an African man looking imploringly up, and the slogan underneath

192
00:22:57,520 --> 00:23:07,520
says, am I not a man and a brother? The insistence that our humanity is common, and they're not an

193
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:13,280
inferior species. So it was that Christian view that you'll find it at the beginning of

194
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:18,640
John Wesley's Thoughts Upon Slavery in 1774, and it was that Christian view that particularly

195
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:24,640
through evangelical Christianity, through Methodism, through non-conformist Christianity,

196
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:30,080
really became widespread in England in the late 1700s, early 1800s.

197
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:36,880
In America, in Canada, in New Zealand, in my own home country, Australia, the dispossession of

198
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:45,600
Native peoples, still widely discussed in terms of not only being a terrible thing, but sometimes

199
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:52,560
there's the hint that it was genocidal, that there was the intent to wipe out a people.

200
00:23:54,880 --> 00:24:01,200
There's a proper reading of the historical record supports such a contention, that there was somehow

201
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:06,720
a premeditated intention to do away with people on the basis of race.

202
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:18,400
In my view, no. I mean, as you well know, the classic alleged example of genocide was what

203
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:24,640
happened in Tasmania in the 1830s and 40s. The Australian art critic, Robert Hughes, said that

204
00:24:25,280 --> 00:24:31,440
that was kind of the one infamous example of genocide within the British Empire.

205
00:24:32,160 --> 00:24:40,480
This, of course, is highly controversial, but my view that what happened in Tasmania

206
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:47,920
is not fairly described as genocide, is shared by Australian historians such as Henry Reynolds and

207
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:56,080
Dirk Moses, who rightly, I think, certainly Reynolds rightly says that we need to define genocide

208
00:24:57,040 --> 00:25:05,440
as international law defines it, namely as an intentional and systematic attempt to exterminate

209
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:11,280
people. I mean, the paradigm of genocide is, of course, Hitler's final solution. Very deliberate,

210
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:17,680
state-sponsored, state-organized, and very systematic. That's the paradigm.

211
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:24,480
And nothing like that happened in Tasmania nor anywhere else in the British Empire. That's

212
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:31,280
not to say that there weren't settlers who were so hostile to native peoples that when they

213
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:38,000
encountered them, they tried to kill as many as they could. But from my reading of Australian

214
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:51,440
New Zealand, African and North American history, colonial government never sought to perpetrate

215
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:58,640
genocide. And on the contrary, colonial government strove to moderate the impact of settlers on

216
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:03,280
natives, particularly in the 1800s after they'd been this kind of moral revolution in England.

217
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:08,240
And again, evangelical Christianity was a major force here. Colonial government tried to

218
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:16,720
moderate the impact of settlers on natives and strove to restrain violence and to restrain

219
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:24,960
settler violence. So there was no systematic, state-sponsored attempt at exterminating people.

220
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:32,160
Although peoples were sometimes annihilated, almost invariably by disease. So the Bayo took

221
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:39,360
people of Newfoundland in what's now Canada in the 1700s, disappeared through a combination of

222
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:46,560
disease, warfare with other tribes, and the impact of Europeans. But again, it wasn't deliberate.

223
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:52,640
It's an important distinction to make, I think, between the actions of individuals

224
00:26:53,280 --> 00:26:58,480
and what was sanctioned by the state and what was not. So I think of a horrendous massacre that

225
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:07,040
happened not far from where I live. And it was undertaken by a group of highly irresponsible

226
00:27:07,040 --> 00:27:15,440
and very nasty Stockman. The state apparatus, if I can put it that way, slowly, and in a pretty

227
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:24,880
creaking way, nonetheless, actually assisted on justice. And nine perpetrators out of 11 people

228
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:33,360
involved, white men, were hung for what they had done quite early on. So the state, in a sense,

229
00:27:35,280 --> 00:27:44,080
often not as effectively as it might have, but it did seek, in that case, to insist on justice,

230
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:50,160
to recognize that a white man, and this is the language that was sort of being used at the time,

231
00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:56,000
who murdered a black man, should hang for it. Yes. So I think there's a, isn't there a cartoon that

232
00:27:56,000 --> 00:28:05,120
Governor Arthur had put about, which was explaining in cartoon form to Aboriginal people that there

233
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:10,720
will be equal justice, that if a white man kills an aborigine, they tool that. That's correct.

234
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:19,600
But just on that, my perception is that in Australia and elsewhere,

235
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:27,360
if there was something to criticize about colonial government, it was too weak. It wasn't

236
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:32,400
powerful enough to control what was going on. But then I think we need to remember that

237
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:40,960
government in early 19th century Britain was small and weak. So when you've got famine in Ireland,

238
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:46,160
just across the Irish Sea, part of the problem is that the government doesn't have the resources

239
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:56,240
to deal with that problem adequately. And just in terms of personnel, I think around,

240
00:28:56,320 --> 00:29:06,160
even as late as the 1880s in Canada, you have 1,000 Royal Canadian mounted police

241
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:18,080
patrolling the whole of Canada, 1,000 men, this vast territory. And I suspect in Australia

242
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:23,360
it was the same story, that the government didn't have the personnel, the army, the police

243
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:27,840
are sufficient to control what was going on in the frontiers, but they did their best.

244
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:33,760
No, you can't talk about the British Empire without considering India. And it's an interesting

245
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:41,040
case. It's a rising superpower. It's becoming the most populous nation on earth. It's a little

246
00:29:41,040 --> 00:29:47,120
uncertain in its democracy at times, but it is a democracy. And I often think to myself

247
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:58,240
that it may not have been a democracy if Britain had not in the end shown them what democracy was.

248
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:06,400
The record's not all bad. They could have left a complete shambles and a dysfunctional state.

249
00:30:09,280 --> 00:30:16,320
Yes. So what did the British do for India? First of all, they created it because when the British

250
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:23,840
arrived in India, in the subcontinent in the 1700s, it was a mosaic of different states,

251
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:31,040
different princely states speaking a variety of languages. And by the time the British left in

252
00:30:31,040 --> 00:30:39,840
1947, sadly, British India was divided into Pakistan and India because of religious tensions.

253
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:48,160
But what was left of India was a very large unitary state in which English was widely spoken

254
00:30:48,160 --> 00:30:55,760
at least at certain levels. So there was a linguistic coherence. And so insofar as India

255
00:30:55,760 --> 00:31:01,680
now is thriving economically, the fact that there is a common language and a common state and a

256
00:31:01,680 --> 00:31:10,960
common market must bear some large responsibility for that. But also in terms of the rule of law,

257
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:20,160
I mean, the Indian civil service under the British had reputation for very high integrity.

258
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:27,280
And I don't know to what extent the Indian civil service as it is now has maintained that tradition.

259
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:33,680
But if you want conditions for that are attractive to investors, then the rule of law,

260
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:42,000
a lack of corruption in government, a large common market, and a common language English

261
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:48,400
helps enormously is very attractive. So although it's true that the current

262
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:55,200
vigor of the Indian economy owes a lot to the abandonment of socialist policies, which the

263
00:31:56,160 --> 00:32:02,480
immediate post independence Indian governments adopted. Nevertheless, the things the British

264
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:08,880
put in place that provide conditions for a vigorous economic life.

265
00:32:09,920 --> 00:32:14,720
And it does raise the question, I think, as well. You often hear this story, this line that

266
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:20,000
the West is responsible for the dysfunctionality of former colonies today.

267
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:30,720
And it overlooks often what those countries or conglomeration of communities, which India was,

268
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:38,480
I suppose, what they were really like in terms of functionality prior to the involvement of the West.

269
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:49,360
One of the general benefits of Imperial authority is that it pacifies what would otherwise be

270
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:56,400
a multiplicity of warring peoples. And that was certainly the case in India when the East India

271
00:32:56,400 --> 00:33:04,480
Company first landed there. Mughal Imperial authority had disintegrated and there was constant

272
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:15,040
civil wars among Indians. And one of the effects of the expansion of the rule of the East India

273
00:33:15,040 --> 00:33:23,840
Company in the late 1700s was peace, and as a consequence of peace, economic prosperity.

274
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:33,360
So if one person I quote in my book, John Malcolm, a Scotsman born about 50 miles east of where I

275
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:44,000
was born, in fact, he was a founder member of the club in which we now sit. He went out to India in

276
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:55,120
about 1780 at the age of 13. And in the around 1800, he wrote about how because of the ending

277
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:59,760
of civil war and the imposition of British rule, the peasants were returning to the fields and

278
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:07,600
they were coming fertile again. So the imperial imposed peace has the benefit of allowing economic

279
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:14,080
life to flourish. And that was one of the benefits of the imposition of British imperial rule in

280
00:34:14,880 --> 00:34:22,720
India. There's an interesting counter example in Southern Africa when in 1879 the British invaded

281
00:34:22,720 --> 00:34:30,160
and conquered the Zulu Kingdom. And in order to break up its power because it was a highly

282
00:34:30,160 --> 00:34:35,120
militarized society, the British broke up the Zulu Kingdom into about a dozen different little

283
00:34:35,120 --> 00:34:43,760
kinglets. And sometime afterwards, some Zulu leaders were heard to complain. And they said,

284
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:48,240
you know, you British, you conquer us, we get the right of conquest. Fine, you get to rule us.

285
00:34:48,880 --> 00:34:53,040
Now would you please do so? Because what you've done is you come here, you've conquered us,

286
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:58,080
you've broken us up. And because you haven't imposed your imperial authority, we're now quarreling

287
00:34:58,080 --> 00:35:05,760
among one another. So again, sometimes the fault of imperial rule was it was sometimes too weak.

288
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:13,280
But when it's imposed, it has the benefit of creating peace and as a consequence of that

289
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:21,840
economic prosperity. Central to any account of colonialism is surely the importation of missionaries

290
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:29,680
and Christianity to non-Christian lands. What did you discover in your research in this area

291
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:38,800
about the relationship between Christianity and missionaries and colonialization?

292
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:48,320
So you're right, John, that Christianity became important for the empire around the end of the

293
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:58,320
1700s, early 1800s because of the evangelical awakening in England. And that fueled the

294
00:36:00,080 --> 00:36:04,160
movement for the abolition of slavery. And then it fueled concern for the plight of

295
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:09,680
native peoples in likes of Australia and North America. So in that sense, it became

296
00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:22,880
a central and important humanizing feature. But in one sense, early on, contrary to one myth about

297
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:29,440
colonialism, missionaries were not central to the project because

298
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:37,120
colonial officials often found missionaries to be a nuisance. Why were they a nuisance?

299
00:36:37,120 --> 00:36:42,400
Well, because if you are Christian missionaries into India, for example, and they start to

300
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:47,920
proselytize and preach the gospel, then Indians get upset. And the colonial officials then have

301
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:54,000
to deal with the upset. So in fact, the East India Company banned missionaries until about the 1830s.

302
00:36:55,440 --> 00:37:02,400
So it's not true to say that Christian missionaries were sent to the lap dogs of the tool of empire.

303
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:10,320
Far from it, and often you'd find missionaries in New Zealand or Africa and indeed Canada

304
00:37:11,840 --> 00:37:17,680
lobbying the imperial government in London to constrain the actions of colonial governments

305
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:26,400
in the colonies. So missionaries could be pains in the backside to colonial governments

306
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:33,680
because they were critical and often humanitarian. Now it's often, it's sometimes often thought that

307
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:42,480
missionaries pushed Christianity down the throats of natives. Well, that wasn't true because missionaries

308
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:51,760
didn't have the power to do that. It is true, sadly, for example, in the residential schools in

309
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:58,080
Canada where native children were brought so they could learn English and agriculture. It is true

310
00:37:58,080 --> 00:38:06,080
that sometimes missionaries were, Christian missionaries were too zealous and too dismissive of

311
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:14,960
native culture. So there was an element of cultural racism there, not always, but sometimes. But often

312
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:24,240
native peoples found Christianity attractive. So Ronald Hyam, who was an historian of the British

313
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:31,680
Empire, writes that in Africa, the Christian message of the brotherhood of humanity and

314
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:40,000
equality in Christ was naturally enormously attractive to people in the African margins,

315
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:47,120
young people, women trying, young women trying to avoid female circumcision slaves

316
00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:55,680
and others. And so native people sometimes found Christianity very attractive. They adopted it,

317
00:38:56,400 --> 00:39:01,200
they adopted it, but they also, you know, what they adopted, they also changed and adapted. So

318
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:09,200
Africa and Christianity found African expression for Christianity too. So there isn't

319
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:13,760
any relationship between Christianity and native peoples was a very mixed one and also

320
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:19,520
between colonial authorities and missions was a very mixed one. But it's certainly not true to

321
00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:26,160
think of Christian missions as simply an extension of colonial oppression that's far too simplistic.

322
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:33,520
What do we know about the distinctive approaches to colonisation by the different nations that

323
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:39,840
engaged in it? Well, it wasn't just the British, the French, the Spanish, the Dutch, the Germans.

324
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:43,600
They had different approaches. There were different outcomes.

325
00:39:45,840 --> 00:39:51,200
What did you find there? And what were the driving influences for their different approaches?

326
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:58,000
Yes. To be frank, John, I don't, I can't claim to know enough about other European

327
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:05,360
empires. I know something. So, you know, if you're an expert, compare us and go to

328
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:12,480
Crescent Kumar's book, Visions of Empire, a very good book published about eight years ago.

329
00:40:13,120 --> 00:40:20,400
But here are some things I have picked up. I think on the negative side, I think

330
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:29,040
the British were more reluctant to allow native peoples, native elites, into the top echelons

331
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:36,240
of government. So in India, for example, yes, Indians were involved in governing other Indians,

332
00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:42,880
but not right at the top. I had the impression the French in Africa were better at integrating

333
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:48,560
elites into the top. And in that respect, I think the French did better.

334
00:40:53,120 --> 00:41:01,600
On the other hand, the British tended to adhere to the liberal principle that

335
00:41:02,640 --> 00:41:07,600
colonies should become increasingly independent. And as you well know, partly because the British

336
00:41:07,600 --> 00:41:12,560
learnt from the American War of Independence, you can't keep tight control of colonies at the far

337
00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:17,120
end of the world, particularly when you take months to communicate with them. And so starting

338
00:41:17,120 --> 00:41:22,800
with Canada in the 1960s, and then Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa by the 1930s are

339
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:28,880
virtually independent. And they have, I think, common, some common defence policies. And India's

340
00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:36,240
on the same track after the First World War. So the model of the British model of empire was

341
00:41:36,240 --> 00:41:40,640
really a kind of relaxing into a commonwealth of nations. And that phrase is used as early as the

342
00:41:40,640 --> 00:41:47,440
First World War, whereas the French had a model of, were integrating the colonies into France.

343
00:41:48,080 --> 00:41:54,320
And so to this day, French overseas territories send representatives to the Assemblee National

344
00:41:54,320 --> 00:42:02,480
in France. So that was another difference. And then a third point would be, whereas the British

345
00:42:03,600 --> 00:42:10,320
decided to devote their imperial power in part to the abolition of slavery all of the world,

346
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:18,320
so yes, the British were involved in slave trading and slavery from 1650 to about to the 1800s. But

347
00:42:18,320 --> 00:42:25,680
then from the early 1800s onwards, the empire for the second half of its life was committed to

348
00:42:25,680 --> 00:42:31,600
abolishing slavery from Brazil across Africa, India, and Malaysia. And that also included

349
00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:40,720
abolishing slavery in South Africa, which the British took over from the Dutch around 1804,

350
00:42:40,720 --> 00:42:48,640
I think, because the Dutch had been importing slaves from Malaysia into South Africa. And for

351
00:42:48,640 --> 00:42:59,360
that reason, some Dutch Africanas, or became known as Boers, meaning farmer, they were so

352
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:06,320
upset at the British suppression of slavery that they left Cape Colony, which the British controlled,

353
00:43:06,320 --> 00:43:11,600
and created their own African Republics, the Transvaal and the Orange Free State.

354
00:43:12,720 --> 00:43:20,720
So on that point, Dutch colonists and British colonialism differed in terms of the treatment

355
00:43:20,720 --> 00:43:28,160
of Native Africans. And that was why when the Second Anglo-Bore War broke out in 1899,

356
00:43:29,120 --> 00:43:33,280
black Africans as well as black African Americans tended to support the British.

357
00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:41,760
I think there's often an assumption that colonisation involved great cruelty and violence,

358
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:49,120
that it was about military takeovers, if you like, and the squashing of people.

359
00:43:50,640 --> 00:43:56,240
I don't think it's as simple as that. I think, as you've said, there were various motives,

360
00:43:56,320 --> 00:43:59,440
various different approaches taken at various times by the British.

361
00:44:01,040 --> 00:44:07,040
But I also wonder whether the sort of policies that different countries ran

362
00:44:08,640 --> 00:44:15,360
reflected different ideas about treating Indigenous people decently.

363
00:44:18,240 --> 00:44:25,520
So there's no doubt, John, that in the history of the British Empire, there's a lot of violence.

364
00:44:26,720 --> 00:44:33,680
But we need to put that in context because you and I are privileged to live in parts of the

365
00:44:33,680 --> 00:44:43,520
world that enjoy unprecedented peace and health and wealth and security. And we live in countries

366
00:44:43,520 --> 00:44:48,400
that have strong states that can afford to be very careful about how much violence they use,

367
00:44:48,400 --> 00:44:53,520
because they don't have to use too much of it. But in the past, where states,

368
00:44:54,480 --> 00:45:03,360
colonial governments are weak, where borders are uncertain, there was a lot of conflict,

369
00:45:03,360 --> 00:45:11,600
a lot of violence. But the past was just, it was much more insecure. And where people are insecure,

370
00:45:12,800 --> 00:45:16,560
they don't give other benefits of doubt and there's more violence. So let's just take that as red.

371
00:45:17,680 --> 00:45:22,400
How did the British Empire compare to other empires in terms of violence? Well,

372
00:45:24,240 --> 00:45:29,680
to take one infamous case, you've got the Belgian Empire and the Congo, which,

373
00:45:31,520 --> 00:45:39,040
colony in the Congo, which was notoriously cruel to black Africans. Although to be fair,

374
00:45:39,040 --> 00:45:45,280
as I understand it, that wasn't actually a colony of the Belgian state. It was actually

375
00:45:45,280 --> 00:45:51,440
a private fiefdom of King Leopold. So you might want to say that was the Belgian

376
00:45:51,440 --> 00:45:59,280
support of just the kings. That's a fine point. Then the other allegedly notoriously

377
00:46:03,120 --> 00:46:11,760
cruel expression of European colonialism was in German South East Africa,

378
00:46:12,880 --> 00:46:20,000
where it is widely supposed that the Germans perpetrated a genocide there.

379
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:24,640
Now that's controversial. I have a colleague and friend to the right of me, Bruce Gilley,

380
00:46:24,640 --> 00:46:29,040
who was argued forcefully that that wasn't the case, but it's widely held to be the case.

381
00:46:30,560 --> 00:46:40,640
And then you've got the Japanese when they invaded China, famously the rape of Nanjing or

382
00:46:40,640 --> 00:46:47,600
Nanking, where no one knows how many, but several hundred thousand Chinese civilians were killed

383
00:46:47,600 --> 00:46:53,920
by Japanese troops. And it is notable therefore that in the Second World War,

384
00:46:56,320 --> 00:47:05,200
probably the greatest, yes without a doubt, the greatest number of troops in the British

385
00:47:05,200 --> 00:47:13,280
Empire were Indian. And Indian troops were all volunteers. And although Indian troops were

386
00:47:13,360 --> 00:47:19,920
deployed in North Africa and in Italy during the Second World War, most of them were fighting

387
00:47:19,920 --> 00:47:27,600
the Japanese in Burma and India. And they chose to fight with the British against the Japanese. Why?

388
00:47:28,800 --> 00:47:31,920
Not because they wanted the British to stay and rule them forever,

389
00:47:33,840 --> 00:47:37,280
but they sure as damn didn't want the Japanese to rule them because they read the papers,

390
00:47:37,280 --> 00:47:45,040
they heard the reports of what the Japanese did in China in Manchuria. And compared to the

391
00:47:45,040 --> 00:47:54,320
Japanese, the British were to Indians at that time far preferable. And as I said, as we discussed

392
00:47:54,320 --> 00:48:00,160
earlier, I don't think the British were responsible for perpetrating genocide in Tasmania or anywhere

393
00:48:00,160 --> 00:48:08,480
else. Whereas it seems that in some cases, European empires did commit genocide.

394
00:48:10,880 --> 00:48:17,920
So we hear endlessly that there are endless negatives about what Britain in particular

395
00:48:17,920 --> 00:48:24,320
has done in the rest of the world in the name of colonialism. And you've been very honest about

396
00:48:24,320 --> 00:48:32,880
some of those failings. Can we get a handle on the good news, the positives, as you discover them

397
00:48:32,880 --> 00:48:40,320
to be? Yeah. So in the conclusion to my book, I draw up two lists of, I draw up as it were,

398
00:48:40,320 --> 00:48:45,120
the debit column in the ledger and then the credit column. The credit column is actually longer.

399
00:48:46,880 --> 00:48:51,280
So here are some of the items in the credit ledger. We talked about anti-slavery and this was a

400
00:48:51,840 --> 00:48:56,400
consistent policy for 150 years for the second half of the empire's life.

401
00:48:59,040 --> 00:49:06,400
There was also the imposition of peace, I mentioned. Native peoples did benefit from

402
00:49:07,040 --> 00:49:14,560
the imposition of a pure authority which subdued warfare between natives.

403
00:49:15,520 --> 00:49:24,640
There was also the establishment of the rule of law. I was in Shanghai in China a few years ago and

404
00:49:25,280 --> 00:49:30,560
met a young couple from Singapore. And as soon as Daniel had introduced himself to me, he said,

405
00:49:31,600 --> 00:49:35,920
any prompting, he said, we in Singapore are grateful to you, British, for the rule of law.

406
00:49:36,320 --> 00:49:46,800
And another anecdote I have related to that is I had a Chinese colleague from Hong Kong visiting

407
00:49:46,800 --> 00:49:57,440
me in Oxford and I said to him, so, Pingchong, what do you think about the British legacy,

408
00:49:58,240 --> 00:50:06,640
the colonial legacy in Hong Kong? And he said, well, if in the 1950s or 60s,

409
00:50:06,640 --> 00:50:13,040
China had been a liberal democracy, Hong Kong wouldn't look so good. But in the 50s, late 50s,

410
00:50:13,680 --> 00:50:21,440
early 50s, China was in a state of anarchy and civil war and that's why you had a million or two

411
00:50:21,440 --> 00:50:28,320
Chinese, no one knows how many, fleeing mainland China, coming into the non-democratic colony of

412
00:50:28,320 --> 00:50:36,480
Hong Kong. Why? Because at least there there was the rule of law which provides life with

413
00:50:36,480 --> 00:50:41,920
predictability and you can at least have sufficient stability to flourish there.

414
00:50:42,640 --> 00:50:46,160
So the establishment of the rule of law was really important, very important for foreign

415
00:50:46,160 --> 00:50:53,760
investment. The British up until 1929, I think, invested more overseas than any other European

416
00:50:53,760 --> 00:51:00,240
country and investors don't invest unless the environment is secure, because otherwise they

417
00:51:00,240 --> 00:51:06,320
risk losing their investment. So the establishment of the rule of law stable government encouraged

418
00:51:06,320 --> 00:51:15,120
investment in India and Africa and Australia and North America. And not least thanks to that,

419
00:51:17,440 --> 00:51:28,640
look at what the British Empire grew up. So the United States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand

420
00:51:29,520 --> 00:51:36,080
and indeed Israel, some of the most prosperous, stable liberal countries in the world, all of them

421
00:51:37,040 --> 00:51:46,720
were progeny of the British Empire. So I think there are quite a large number of benefits that

422
00:51:46,720 --> 00:51:55,600
the Empire conferred upon various parts of the world. He's a novel thought. There are probably

423
00:51:57,360 --> 00:52:05,200
not a few people who wouldn't mind a little British rule of law today. Yes, in the sense that

424
00:52:06,080 --> 00:52:12,480
we hear endless condemnation of Britain in relation to the slave trade, but nobody seems

425
00:52:12,480 --> 00:52:20,320
to care about the 45 to 50 million slaves around the world today. Yes. It says something very

426
00:52:20,320 --> 00:52:25,360
profound that we want to revisit the past, whereas in fact the story there is not as people believe

427
00:52:25,360 --> 00:52:32,800
it and ignore the fact that there's a great need for people to stand up now as the anti-slavery

428
00:52:32,800 --> 00:52:38,320
campaigners in Britain did so effectively a couple of hundred years ago. No, that's absolutely

429
00:52:38,320 --> 00:52:45,040
right. And let's be clear, the reason why some people wanted to focus on the sins of slavery,

430
00:52:45,040 --> 00:52:52,480
which were sins, is political. And people wanted to focus on the evils of colonialism because it is

431
00:52:52,480 --> 00:53:02,560
politically useful as a kind of lever to achieve things politically. But the whole truth is all

432
00:53:02,560 --> 00:53:07,520
together more mixed. And I think it's really important politically we get our history right,

433
00:53:07,520 --> 00:53:15,760
otherwise we're susceptible to false guilt and we embark on well-meaning but ill-judged policies.

434
00:53:15,760 --> 00:53:24,240
So let's get the history right. We live in a culture now where there's an extraordinary,

435
00:53:24,240 --> 00:53:37,760
almost self-loathing of everything that we are and a quite noticeable manipulation of history

436
00:53:38,640 --> 00:53:45,120
to support a narrative that we should be ashamed of what has gone before us.

437
00:53:46,480 --> 00:53:49,680
And I think that is playing out very badly for young people.

438
00:53:49,680 --> 00:53:59,520
What advice would you give that's a sort of a question from left field to parents and influencers

439
00:53:59,520 --> 00:54:10,960
and so forth when it comes to trying to help their children develop a more balanced approach,

440
00:54:10,960 --> 00:54:15,280
because it seems to be critically important to me. The point you made earlier, we're all a mixture

441
00:54:15,280 --> 00:54:20,800
of good and bad. It's never as simple as black and white. And if you believe it is, you fall

442
00:54:20,800 --> 00:54:25,840
under this terrible trap of thinking the world is just, life is just one long battle between good

443
00:54:25,840 --> 00:54:31,680
people and bad people. Yes. And if you believe the story is told about our colonial past,

444
00:54:31,680 --> 00:54:36,320
then it was nothing but a litany of racism and oppression and violence. And that has to shake

445
00:54:36,320 --> 00:54:44,320
your confidence in the nation states and the institutions that we built. Everything comes

446
00:54:44,720 --> 00:54:54,000
under question because our states were involved in this imperial oppression and wickedness.

447
00:54:54,720 --> 00:54:59,120
So it's really important that the whole truth be told and the whole truth is that the British

448
00:54:59,120 --> 00:55:04,080
Empire, for example, did some very good things as well as some very bad things.

449
00:55:05,760 --> 00:55:10,160
And so what advice will I give? Well, obviously the first piece of advice I give is read my book,

450
00:55:10,960 --> 00:55:17,440
because even if you don't agree with the moral argument I make, and I try at the end of the

451
00:55:17,440 --> 00:55:23,600
book to come to an overall judgment about the British Empire morally, even if you don't agree

452
00:55:23,600 --> 00:55:28,400
with that, in the course of the book, you will learn a lot about what actually happened.

453
00:55:29,680 --> 00:55:39,200
And part of the problem today, the reason why this relentlessly negative reading of our

454
00:55:39,840 --> 00:55:45,760
colonial past has taken root, particularly in the educated elite and the media institutions,

455
00:55:46,480 --> 00:55:52,480
is that no one knows the history. So if activists come along and say it was all racism and genocide,

456
00:55:53,040 --> 00:55:59,120
no one knows enough to contradict them. So my first piece of advice is a part of parents of

457
00:55:59,120 --> 00:56:05,360
teachers read something, read my book. The other book I'd recommend is Neil Ferguson's

458
00:56:06,320 --> 00:56:12,880
book entitled Simply Empire, published 20 years ago. I re-read it recently. It's still good,

459
00:56:12,880 --> 00:56:20,400
and besides, unlike mine, it's got pictures. So do that. The other resource would be the

460
00:56:20,400 --> 00:56:26,480
website of a body called History Reclaimed, which is based in this country. It's run by Robert

461
00:56:26,560 --> 00:56:31,520
Toomes out of Cambridge University, or it's not a Cambridge University

462
00:56:33,920 --> 00:56:42,080
entity, but he's at Cambridge and he runs it. And this is designed to get historians to write

463
00:56:42,080 --> 00:56:48,400
material that is more balanced and provides the other side of the story. And there's lots of

464
00:56:48,400 --> 00:56:55,920
stuff up on the website. So I'd really recommend that parents and teachers of history look at

465
00:56:55,920 --> 00:57:04,640
that website, which is universally available. I put a proposition to you, then, and just to test it.

466
00:57:06,400 --> 00:57:11,840
You could argue that the means by which Britain became the most powerful nation on Earth, as it

467
00:57:11,840 --> 00:57:18,080
was for a very long time, contained some bad stories as well as some good stories and some

468
00:57:18,080 --> 00:57:25,440
indifferent stories. But it needs to be balanced by the reality that then Britain became the

469
00:57:25,440 --> 00:57:32,160
first and only empire of its type to actually abolish slavery, so far as I'm aware. And it was

470
00:57:32,160 --> 00:57:39,520
able to take on the role of ending it beyond its own economy and peoples because it was big and

471
00:57:39,520 --> 00:57:48,880
powerful. So there's two sides to that one story alone. Yes. So Britain was not the first to

472
00:57:48,880 --> 00:57:54,320
abolish the safer Denmark was, but in Northwest Europe, you have a number of nations that come

473
00:57:54,320 --> 00:58:00,400
to the view for the first time in the history of the world that slavery as such is unacceptable.

474
00:58:01,280 --> 00:58:06,800
And then Britain, because after the end of the Napoleonic wars in the 15th, Britain then becomes

475
00:58:06,800 --> 00:58:12,560
for a century, or just over a century, the most powerful nation in the world. Britain devotes

476
00:58:13,840 --> 00:58:18,800
a lot of its imperial power to suppressing slavery across the world. In the 1820s and 30s,

477
00:58:18,800 --> 00:58:24,160
the slave trade department was the largest in the British Foreign Office. Around 1840,

478
00:58:24,160 --> 00:58:30,560
50, the Royal Navy devoted 13% of its total manpower just as oppressing the slave trade across

479
00:58:30,560 --> 00:58:37,120
the Atlantic from West Africa to the Americas. So there's that. There's also the fact that,

480
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:45,600
as I said earlier, the British realized, or some British realized that the empire could not consist

481
00:58:45,600 --> 00:58:53,920
of a tightly controlled centralized state. So the Britain tightly controls the destinies of

482
00:58:53,920 --> 00:59:02,400
peoples in Australia and Africa and North America. And so there was a recognition. And in fact,

483
00:59:02,400 --> 00:59:10,400
in the 1820s and in India, Bombay and Calcutta and Madras are all governed by Scotsman. And every

484
00:59:10,400 --> 00:59:15,040
one of the Scotsman says, folks, we can't be here forever. All we can hope to do

485
00:59:15,920 --> 00:59:22,000
is to help the Indians develop decent government, and then we should leave with grace and hopefully

486
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:27,760
good will. And that view was embodied in the developing Commonwealth idea, as I said earlier,

487
00:59:27,760 --> 00:59:32,480
whereby the empire relaxes into a family of independent nations, which is what it's become.

488
00:59:33,440 --> 00:59:38,320
And I think that stands to that's the kind of liberal, a liberal vision of the destiny of

489
00:59:38,320 --> 00:59:42,480
empire. And that, I think, is creditable. And then the last thing I'd say is,

490
00:59:44,960 --> 00:59:54,640
remember how the British Empire exhausted itself. 1939 to 45. Doing what? Fighting the massively

491
00:59:54,640 --> 01:00:02,480
murderous racist regime in Hitler's Berlin. And between May 1941, France fell, and June

492
01:00:03,440 --> 01:00:09,840
June 41, when Hitler invaded Russia, the British Empire offered the only military

493
01:00:09,840 --> 01:00:16,160
resistance to Nazism with the solo exception of Greece. And that has to say something good

494
01:00:16,160 --> 01:00:20,160
about what the empire had become and what, when push came to shove, what it stood for.

495
01:00:21,760 --> 01:00:27,040
To its end, like every political body, it contained both good and bad, virtual advice.

496
01:00:27,840 --> 01:00:34,560
But I think the fact that, thanks to the moral integrity and wisdom of Winston Churchill,

497
01:00:35,360 --> 01:00:40,560
Britain and the empire, and you know very well, and we British know now too,

498
01:00:41,280 --> 01:00:47,120
the efforts to defeat Hitler was an imperial effort. Your father was North Africa, mine was in

499
01:00:47,120 --> 01:00:53,360
Italy. He was mistaken for an Indian because the Indian division was off to his right in Italy,

500
01:00:53,360 --> 01:01:00,560
not India. It was a remarkable multinational effort. And that was devoted to defeating,

501
01:01:00,560 --> 01:01:07,680
not only Imperial Japan, but also Nazi Germany. And that, I think, if you're going to lose an

502
01:01:07,680 --> 01:01:14,560
empire, I can't think of a better way to do it. Well, thank you very much. That's a great note

503
01:01:14,560 --> 01:01:21,840
to end on. We need to recognise that history can teach us a great deal, but we need to know what

504
01:01:21,840 --> 01:01:35,360
the history actually is. Absolutely. So please read my book.
