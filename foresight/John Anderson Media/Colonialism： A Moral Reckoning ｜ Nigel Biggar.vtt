00:00.000 --> 00:08.160
Colonial government never sought to perpetuate genocide, and on the contrary a colonial government

00:08.160 --> 00:13.920
strove to moderate the impact of settlers on natives, particularly in the 1800s,

00:13.920 --> 00:18.720
after there had been this kind of moral revolution in England. And again, even Joe Christianity was

00:18.720 --> 00:24.000
a major force here. Colonial government tried to moderate the impact of settlers on natives

00:24.720 --> 00:27.280
and strove to to to restrain violence.

00:38.880 --> 00:43.280
Nigel Bigger, who I count a friend and has been with us on this program before,

00:43.920 --> 00:49.760
is Emeritus Regis Professor of Moral and Pastoral Theology at the University of Oxford.

00:50.320 --> 00:55.840
His most recent book is Colonialism, a Moral Reckoning.

00:56.640 --> 00:58.320
Nigel, thank you so much for joining us.

00:59.040 --> 01:00.480
My pleasure to be back again, John.

01:01.120 --> 01:05.840
Now, the many things that someone with your extensive list of qualifications and background

01:05.840 --> 01:14.080
could have chosen to do, you've written a book about colonialism. Why? And you argue that it's not

01:14.800 --> 01:19.600
the original sin, as some people say, it is of countries like Britain.

01:21.760 --> 01:28.000
So, John, that's a good question. And the first thing I'd say is, I've been reading,

01:28.960 --> 01:35.280
although I'm a theologian and an ethicist professionally, my first love was always history

01:35.280 --> 01:40.960
and my preferred reading is history. And I've been reading about, in particular, British imperial

01:40.960 --> 01:51.280
history for 20, 30 years. And so in recent times, when some people say that the British Empire,

01:51.280 --> 01:58.160
for example, was nothing but a litany of racism and economic exploitation and

01:59.040 --> 02:05.840
wanton violence, I say to myself, well, it was all those things, but it was also the opposite.

02:06.720 --> 02:15.760
So, part of the reason for writing the book was to inform a new generation of

02:15.760 --> 02:21.440
Britons and Australians and Canadians and New Zealanders about the whole truth about their

02:21.440 --> 02:27.120
colonial past, not just the politically partisan story. So that was one reason.

02:28.880 --> 02:33.680
A second reason has to do with the fact that I'm actually Anglo-Scottish. I know that sound like

02:33.680 --> 02:40.000
it. I sound only marginally more Scottish than you do, John. But I was born there. And if you

02:40.000 --> 02:43.840
get me to say a word like Jerusalem, then it comes out. But otherwise, I sound English.

02:44.800 --> 02:52.880
But what that meant was that when the referendum on Scottish independence was held in 2014,

02:54.240 --> 03:01.840
I was a visceral anti-independence person because I've lived on both sides of the

03:01.840 --> 03:07.680
border and I actually think the UK is important and valuable and it's important to keep it together.

03:07.680 --> 03:16.880
But I noticed that some Scottish nationalists were justifying Scottish independence as a form of

03:16.880 --> 03:25.600
kind of national self-purification in terms of Britain equals empire equals evil and Scotland's

03:26.160 --> 03:31.440
separation from Britain and Britain's the UK's disillusion would be an act of kind of national

03:31.520 --> 03:37.600
self-purification. And again, I thought to myself, well, that's just far too simplistic and as it

03:37.600 --> 03:45.760
stands, it's just not true. And then more recently, particularly since the killing of George Floyd in

03:46.640 --> 03:51.040
2020 in Minneapolis and the Black Lives Matter movement coming across the Atlantic here,

03:54.560 --> 04:00.560
we've had an obsession with colonialism and British colonialism in particular.

04:01.440 --> 04:10.080
And I've noticed that empire has been a feature of human history since almost the dawn of time.

04:11.360 --> 04:18.320
People with non-white skins, Arabs, Indians, Comanche and others were doing empire long

04:18.320 --> 04:23.760
before Europeans did it. Why the obsession with European empires? Why the fixation on British

04:23.760 --> 04:30.240
empire? And I interpret it as being an assault on the record of the West. So for all those

04:30.240 --> 04:36.400
reasons, partly historical, then in domestically British, political and then more broadly,

04:37.360 --> 04:41.680
international politics. I wanted to write this book and to put the record straight.

04:42.880 --> 04:49.360
It's a courageous thing to do because we live in such a sensorial age. And to defend Western

04:49.360 --> 04:57.520
culture seems to be to invite, disdain and even cancellation. I understand you even had a bit

04:57.520 --> 05:06.640
of trouble with your publisher or proposed publisher. Yes, I did. I was offered a contract

05:06.640 --> 05:13.360
to write what was then called An Intelligent Person's Guide to Colonialism by Bloomsbury Publishing

05:13.360 --> 05:23.040
in spring of 2018. I produced the manuscript at the end of 2020. The deadline was 31st of December.

05:23.040 --> 05:32.480
I produced it at two o'clock on the 31st of December. And my commission editor read it and in

05:32.480 --> 05:38.480
January he wrote back saying he was speechless with admiration at its rigor and comprehensiveness.

05:38.480 --> 05:43.920
He said it was an important book and he predicted it would sell up to 20,000 copies.

05:44.720 --> 05:52.320
And then it went into the copy editing process and they produced a cover. But then in March,

05:52.320 --> 05:58.480
I got an email from the top of Bloomsbury saying that they were going to postpone publication

05:58.480 --> 06:06.080
indefinitely because, to use their words, public feeling is unfavorable. And I was told informally

06:06.080 --> 06:11.280
they wanted me to walk away from my contract. I could go into the gory detail and I'll spare you.

06:13.440 --> 06:22.240
Suffice to say that eventually I, because I had no other choice, I agreed to walk away

06:22.240 --> 06:30.720
from the contract without any other publisher in sight. That was in April 2021. Happily,

06:30.720 --> 06:34.640
in August, 21, William Collins came to my rescue and they published the book

06:35.440 --> 06:40.480
in this country and in Australia, I think, in early February and it came out in

06:40.480 --> 06:47.280
Canada and the States last week. Well, I don't know what's happened to the idea that

06:48.240 --> 06:54.480
we ought to have public debates, contestability of ideas, attempts to get to the truth of things,

06:55.120 --> 06:58.080
but I find it a very, very disturbing development.

06:58.080 --> 07:03.440
No, it was. And of course, when I realized they weren't going to publish it, I was momentarily

07:03.440 --> 07:08.400
depressed, partly for personal reasons. But most of all, what depressed me was the thought

07:08.400 --> 07:14.960
that we in Britain had come to the place where judging by what other people said of my work,

07:15.040 --> 07:20.000
John, I'm pretty careful and I'm pretty thorough. And this topic was really important and my

07:20.800 --> 07:23.920
commission editor said it was one of the most important books he'd seen in years.

07:24.640 --> 07:29.920
And yet it seemed that this British publisher wouldn't publish it because public feeling was

07:29.920 --> 07:33.840
unfavorable. Now, of course, we all know that public feeling is many things, there are many

07:33.840 --> 07:41.200
public feelings, but part of the market, this publisher was scared of offending. And what

07:41.200 --> 07:50.320
that implied for the future of a liberal free open society in this country really depressed me.

07:51.440 --> 07:56.000
It's funny the little moments that make you stop and think it's not as straightforward

07:56.000 --> 08:04.480
as the public mantra might have you believe. Seven or eight years ago, I had occasion to spend

08:04.480 --> 08:10.480
some time in Myanmar, one time Burma. I met a very old man there. He said, you know,

08:10.480 --> 08:18.000
I'm close to the end of my life. I've seen 90 years or so. And only one year of my 90,

08:18.000 --> 08:28.640
did I feel safe and free in my own country. And I said, when was that? 1946. He said,

08:28.640 --> 08:38.560
before that we had Japanese imperialism suffocating us the war. 1946, we were liberated.

08:38.640 --> 08:42.960
And the British ran the place for a year. And I felt good and I felt safe.

08:43.760 --> 08:52.160
Then my own people forced a repressive regime on me. These things are always much more complicated,

08:52.160 --> 08:59.600
much more nuanced, always a story of good and bad. And that takes a lot of unpacking.

08:59.600 --> 09:04.240
But can I ask you, let's be clear what you're talking about, your book is a scrutiny of our

09:04.240 --> 09:11.840
current moral evaluations of colonialism. Yes. What would you describe as the colonialism

09:11.840 --> 09:18.080
that you're writing about? And what sort of main countries have you sought to focus on?

09:19.280 --> 09:25.600
So let me start with Empire, first of all, before I talk about colonialism. So

09:26.400 --> 09:32.880
Empire is a form of political organization which has existed since the dawn of time,

09:32.880 --> 09:38.320
whereby in an empire there are many peoples, but one people dominates, roughly speaking,

09:38.320 --> 09:48.160
that's an empire. Now colonies are a form the empire can sometimes take when the dominant people

09:50.080 --> 09:57.680
emigrate to other parts of the world and settle. So you have European British colonists in Australia,

09:57.680 --> 10:04.720
you have European British colonists in North America. You don't have European British colonists

10:04.720 --> 10:12.720
much in India during the British Empire. So there's a distinction between empire and colonies.

10:14.400 --> 10:18.960
But broadly speaking, and I've used the word colonialism in the title of my book because

10:18.960 --> 10:26.480
that's the one that's used in public discourse. But the book itself focuses on the record of the

10:26.480 --> 10:37.040
British Empire. Why? Partly it's the one I know best. Partly it was the largest of the European

10:37.040 --> 10:47.360
empires. And it's also the one that morphed to some extent into the post-Nahifa 5 American-led

10:47.440 --> 10:56.160
international order. And so when I said earlier that I think that the attack on colonialism,

10:56.880 --> 11:03.200
the attack on the British Empire is an attack on the record of the West, that's one reason why I

11:03.200 --> 11:09.840
focused on it. One of the early claims you make in the book is that the colonial or so-called

11:09.840 --> 11:16.320
colonial project was made up of both good and bad motives. No, the common narrative would be that

11:16.320 --> 11:23.040
they couldn't possibly have been any good motives. I'd appreciate your views on that

11:23.920 --> 11:30.800
preface of briefly by saying not long ago I met an Indian scholar who said to me that much of what

11:30.800 --> 11:38.000
happened in India was very positive, which is surprising. It's not what young people particularly

11:38.000 --> 11:43.440
will ever hear. How can there be good motives? No, indeed, indeed. Yes, you're right. So the assumption

11:43.440 --> 11:51.200
is that empire is always about conquest and oppression and exploitation. But that is much more

11:51.200 --> 11:55.680
to theory than it does to historical fact. So that's one reason why I prefer not to talk about

11:55.680 --> 12:02.080
imperialism or colonialism, because that implies a kind of unitary thing. Whereas in fact,

12:02.800 --> 12:09.040
I mean, maybe in Berlin in 1938, someone decided we'd go to conquer the world. But in the case of

12:09.040 --> 12:12.560
the British Empire and most of the European emperors, it wasn't like that. It was much more ad

12:12.640 --> 12:19.840
hoc, much more responding to circumstance. So how did the British Empire rise? Originally,

12:20.720 --> 12:29.760
in the 1600s, trade. East India Company is given a monopoly of trade between England and India,

12:30.320 --> 12:41.040
and Englishmen sail out to India and establish trading bases in India. Then Englishmen also go

12:41.040 --> 12:46.720
westward across the Atlantic. Why do they do that? Well, partly because Elizabeth first wanted

12:49.360 --> 12:54.080
sailors to harass Spanish shipping, because the Spanish Empire was threatening the Protestant

12:54.080 --> 13:01.680
England. So the irony there is the origins of English Empire are anti-imperial. But to be honest,

13:01.680 --> 13:10.560
also, people like Drake and others were hungry for gold. At the time, I don't think there were

13:10.560 --> 13:16.080
particularly hungry for land, but they were hungry for gold. So you've got those in the early

13:17.440 --> 13:24.000
century of the First British Empire. You have trade, anti-imperial national endeavour,

13:25.040 --> 13:32.720
private hunger for gold. Later on, in the 19th century, the British, one reason the British

13:33.280 --> 13:40.080
ever came to rule East Africa was lobbying by humanitarians to suppress the slave,

13:40.080 --> 13:48.720
the Arab slave trade. And some parts of the empire landed in London at the end of wars

13:48.720 --> 13:54.880
when they were ceded by treaty. So the motives were really quite various. Yes, they included

13:54.880 --> 14:01.680
sometimes greed. They included sometimes racial arrogance. But oftentimes, I mean,

14:02.560 --> 14:09.280
all human endeavour is a mixture of virtue and vice and good motives and bad.

14:10.160 --> 14:15.200
Anyone reflecting on their own private lives knows that. And the imperial endeavour was no

14:15.200 --> 14:21.520
different. We have lost sight of that, haven't we? I mean, we now tend to ascribe virtue

14:22.160 --> 14:29.280
to one group versus another group in a very simplistic way. You disagree with me, so you're

14:29.280 --> 14:37.200
bad and you're all bad. And I'm all right. And there's no allowing for vagraness in between.

14:38.800 --> 14:44.320
Yeah, I think that's right. I mean, I speak as a Christian. The assumption that

14:44.400 --> 14:52.800
virtue and vice runs right through the middle of me is one I long made, and I assume of everyone

14:52.800 --> 14:59.440
else that we're a mixture of virtue and vice. One good effect of that view of the universality

14:59.440 --> 15:06.480
of sinfulness is that when you do me wrong, John, I may be very annoyed and I may rightly

15:06.480 --> 15:12.480
hold you to account for that. But the fact that I know that I, too, am a sinner means that my

15:12.640 --> 15:21.200
judgment on you is tempered, because I, too, am a sinner. And so the sense that

15:22.000 --> 15:30.320
unrighteousness is within here as well as out there actually helps to temper conflict between

15:31.120 --> 15:36.080
individuals and between political parties and between nations. And frankly, a wider

15:36.960 --> 15:44.080
awareness of that wisdom now might see a greater commitment to a more honest debate about issues

15:44.080 --> 15:49.840
of the thought that we're talking today. I think so. Now, you say that colonialism can be said to

15:50.880 --> 15:59.200
have a report card that shows some positives as well as some negatives. What are the negatives,

15:59.200 --> 16:07.520
adversely, as you said? Yeah. So just taking the British Empire, for example,

16:10.560 --> 16:17.040
in the debit column of the Imperial Ledger, you will find roughly 150 years worth of slave

16:17.040 --> 16:25.520
trade and slavery from about 1650 to 1807. You will find, not uncommonly,

16:26.080 --> 16:37.360
offensive racial arrogance. You will also find, very commonly, the abrupt disruption of

16:38.480 --> 16:46.560
social and cultural and economic lives of Native peoples in North America, Australia,

16:46.560 --> 16:53.120
and Africa. The reason for that is that the cultural gap between, let's say,

16:53.120 --> 16:57.280
19th century Europeans with their science and their medicine and their

16:58.080 --> 17:02.560
ocean-going ships and their firearms, the cultural gap between them and many of the

17:02.560 --> 17:08.160
peoples they met was just vast. So the impact of modernity, which was going to happen one way or

17:08.160 --> 17:23.600
another, was severe. And the other major negative impact of European colonial expansion

17:23.600 --> 17:31.920
was disease. I don't understand these things not being a medic, but I understand that because

17:32.000 --> 17:38.880
Europeans had domesticated animals, they had become immune to diseases that animals can spread.

17:39.760 --> 17:47.200
But when they went to North America, and not least Australia, they brought with them

17:47.840 --> 17:51.280
diseases that Native peoples were not immune to and Native peoples suffered grievously.

17:51.920 --> 17:59.520
That said, there is reason to suppose that smallpox was introduced to Northern Australia,

17:59.520 --> 18:04.400
not by Europeans, but by fishermen from what's known in Indonesia. So it wasn't just the Europeans

18:04.400 --> 18:09.680
who spread disease. And by the way, the disease were not spread deliberately, but it was a tragic

18:09.680 --> 18:22.080
evil. Amongst the widely presented arguments that colonialism was evil is, of course, that it was

18:22.080 --> 18:29.920
racist. But I think you challenge that assumption. It's not so simple. And indeed, you hold up the

18:29.920 --> 18:37.920
very interesting illustration of British involvement in Africa to end slavery, which is deeply rooted

18:37.920 --> 18:45.920
in the horrors of racism. So I think we need to have an adult discussion about what we mean

18:45.920 --> 18:51.040
about racism, John. And there are a couple of pages in my book where I lay out what I think

18:51.040 --> 19:02.320
racism is. And I take it to be, I mean, human beings are constantly in the business of identifying

19:02.320 --> 19:07.040
with one group over and against another and thinking themselves, thinking this group,

19:07.040 --> 19:11.920
to which I belong, this football club, this church, this nation, this race is better than

19:11.920 --> 19:17.200
another, because it makes us feel better to be superior to other people. It's a very common thing.

19:17.760 --> 19:24.880
Europeans did not invent racial prejudice. But I think that's what it is. It's denigrating another

19:24.880 --> 19:30.960
people, another race, in an indiscriminate fashion, and then assuming that any member of that race

19:31.840 --> 19:37.760
shares in whatever bad qualities you attributed to it. And that I regard just for the record is

19:37.760 --> 19:46.320
ugly and it's abhorrent. But what I don't think is racist is making discriminate judgments about

19:46.320 --> 19:53.360
another culture and saying, well, in this respect, I think that culture is scientifically or

19:53.360 --> 20:00.800
technologically or perhaps even morally inferior. Now, why do I say that's not racist? Well, it's

20:00.800 --> 20:07.200
partly because when I was a 21st century Britain, look back on my medieval forebears, you bet there

20:07.200 --> 20:15.920
are ways in which I regard our culture of superior to theirs. We don't, thank goodness, hang, draw,

20:15.920 --> 20:23.040
and quarter criminals. We don't burn them alive. Our medicine is superior. Our agriculture is superior.

20:23.920 --> 20:29.440
So if I can say that about my own people a thousand years ago, if I meet other cultures

20:29.440 --> 20:35.280
around the world which have similar practices or a similar level of cultural development,

20:35.360 --> 20:44.800
I also regard them as, in these respects, inferior. And let's also point out that

20:46.560 --> 20:52.480
people who regard themselves as progressive, when they regard, let's say, Christian fundamentalists

20:52.480 --> 21:00.240
in the Southern United States, they regard them typically with contempt. So they regard their

21:00.240 --> 21:07.200
progressive culture of superior to fundamentalist Christian culture. So my view is that needn't

21:07.200 --> 21:12.880
be racist provided you're discriminates. You're not, as it were, indiscriminately

21:12.880 --> 21:19.040
rubbishing of another culture. And the other important respect is this, that it would be racist

21:20.560 --> 21:28.080
as some people toward the end of the 1800s thought to regard non-white peoples as naturally

21:28.080 --> 21:34.560
or biologically inferior. Let's just say, not only are they at this moment in time inferior,

21:34.560 --> 21:39.360
culturally in certain respects, but that's because they are naturally inferior and they will never

21:40.160 --> 21:47.360
significantly improve. That view, as I said, was around in the late Victorian period,

21:47.360 --> 21:52.160
but it never displaced the earlier Christian view. And this is the view that

21:53.040 --> 22:03.200
fuels the very powerful and popular movement to abolish slavery, which gained momentum in

22:03.200 --> 22:09.840
the late 1700s, the Christian view that all human beings are basically equal under God, regardless

22:09.840 --> 22:19.280
of race, and regardless of cultural development. That view was not racist. The worst form of

22:19.280 --> 22:25.680
race, as I think, is that which regards members of another race as naturally and permanently

22:25.680 --> 22:36.880
and biologically inferior. That's insupportable. Often reminded, in my own mind, of the earliest

22:36.880 --> 22:45.920
recognised political slogan that was struck by Josiah Wedgwood during the anti-slavery campaign.

22:46.640 --> 22:50.320
You can still see examples of it everywhere, a very intricate,

22:50.320 --> 22:57.520
beautifully made bas-relief of an African man looking imploringly up, and the slogan underneath

22:57.520 --> 23:07.520
says, am I not a man and a brother? The insistence that our humanity is common, and they're not an

23:07.520 --> 23:13.280
inferior species. So it was that Christian view that you'll find it at the beginning of

23:13.280 --> 23:18.640
John Wesley's Thoughts Upon Slavery in 1774, and it was that Christian view that particularly

23:18.640 --> 23:24.640
through evangelical Christianity, through Methodism, through non-conformist Christianity,

23:24.640 --> 23:30.080
really became widespread in England in the late 1700s, early 1800s.

23:30.960 --> 23:36.880
In America, in Canada, in New Zealand, in my own home country, Australia, the dispossession of

23:36.880 --> 23:45.600
Native peoples, still widely discussed in terms of not only being a terrible thing, but sometimes

23:45.600 --> 23:52.560
there's the hint that it was genocidal, that there was the intent to wipe out a people.

23:54.880 --> 24:01.200
There's a proper reading of the historical record supports such a contention, that there was somehow

24:01.200 --> 24:06.720
a premeditated intention to do away with people on the basis of race.

24:08.400 --> 24:18.400
In my view, no. I mean, as you well know, the classic alleged example of genocide was what

24:18.400 --> 24:24.640
happened in Tasmania in the 1830s and 40s. The Australian art critic, Robert Hughes, said that

24:25.280 --> 24:31.440
that was kind of the one infamous example of genocide within the British Empire.

24:32.160 --> 24:40.480
This, of course, is highly controversial, but my view that what happened in Tasmania

24:40.480 --> 24:47.920
is not fairly described as genocide, is shared by Australian historians such as Henry Reynolds and

24:47.920 --> 24:56.080
Dirk Moses, who rightly, I think, certainly Reynolds rightly says that we need to define genocide

24:57.040 --> 25:05.440
as international law defines it, namely as an intentional and systematic attempt to exterminate

25:05.440 --> 25:11.280
people. I mean, the paradigm of genocide is, of course, Hitler's final solution. Very deliberate,

25:11.520 --> 25:17.680
state-sponsored, state-organized, and very systematic. That's the paradigm.

25:18.400 --> 25:24.480
And nothing like that happened in Tasmania nor anywhere else in the British Empire. That's

25:24.480 --> 25:31.280
not to say that there weren't settlers who were so hostile to native peoples that when they

25:31.280 --> 25:38.000
encountered them, they tried to kill as many as they could. But from my reading of Australian

25:38.320 --> 25:51.440
New Zealand, African and North American history, colonial government never sought to perpetrate

25:51.440 --> 25:58.640
genocide. And on the contrary, colonial government strove to moderate the impact of settlers on

25:58.640 --> 26:03.280
natives, particularly in the 1800s after they'd been this kind of moral revolution in England.

26:03.360 --> 26:08.240
And again, evangelical Christianity was a major force here. Colonial government tried to

26:08.240 --> 26:16.720
moderate the impact of settlers on natives and strove to restrain violence and to restrain

26:16.720 --> 26:24.960
settler violence. So there was no systematic, state-sponsored attempt at exterminating people.

26:25.600 --> 26:32.160
Although peoples were sometimes annihilated, almost invariably by disease. So the Bayo took

26:32.160 --> 26:39.360
people of Newfoundland in what's now Canada in the 1700s, disappeared through a combination of

26:39.360 --> 26:46.560
disease, warfare with other tribes, and the impact of Europeans. But again, it wasn't deliberate.

26:47.200 --> 26:52.640
It's an important distinction to make, I think, between the actions of individuals

26:53.280 --> 26:58.480
and what was sanctioned by the state and what was not. So I think of a horrendous massacre that

26:58.480 --> 27:07.040
happened not far from where I live. And it was undertaken by a group of highly irresponsible

27:07.040 --> 27:15.440
and very nasty Stockman. The state apparatus, if I can put it that way, slowly, and in a pretty

27:15.440 --> 27:24.880
creaking way, nonetheless, actually assisted on justice. And nine perpetrators out of 11 people

27:24.880 --> 27:33.360
involved, white men, were hung for what they had done quite early on. So the state, in a sense,

27:35.280 --> 27:44.080
often not as effectively as it might have, but it did seek, in that case, to insist on justice,

27:44.080 --> 27:50.160
to recognize that a white man, and this is the language that was sort of being used at the time,

27:50.160 --> 27:56.000
who murdered a black man, should hang for it. Yes. So I think there's a, isn't there a cartoon that

27:56.000 --> 28:05.120
Governor Arthur had put about, which was explaining in cartoon form to Aboriginal people that there

28:05.120 --> 28:10.720
will be equal justice, that if a white man kills an aborigine, they tool that. That's correct.

28:11.520 --> 28:19.600
But just on that, my perception is that in Australia and elsewhere,

28:21.760 --> 28:27.360
if there was something to criticize about colonial government, it was too weak. It wasn't

28:27.360 --> 28:32.400
powerful enough to control what was going on. But then I think we need to remember that

28:33.120 --> 28:40.960
government in early 19th century Britain was small and weak. So when you've got famine in Ireland,

28:40.960 --> 28:46.160
just across the Irish Sea, part of the problem is that the government doesn't have the resources

28:47.120 --> 28:56.240
to deal with that problem adequately. And just in terms of personnel, I think around,

28:56.320 --> 29:06.160
even as late as the 1880s in Canada, you have 1,000 Royal Canadian mounted police

29:07.120 --> 29:18.080
patrolling the whole of Canada, 1,000 men, this vast territory. And I suspect in Australia

29:18.080 --> 29:23.360
it was the same story, that the government didn't have the personnel, the army, the police

29:24.320 --> 29:27.840
are sufficient to control what was going on in the frontiers, but they did their best.

29:28.880 --> 29:33.760
No, you can't talk about the British Empire without considering India. And it's an interesting

29:33.760 --> 29:41.040
case. It's a rising superpower. It's becoming the most populous nation on earth. It's a little

29:41.040 --> 29:47.120
uncertain in its democracy at times, but it is a democracy. And I often think to myself

29:47.120 --> 29:58.240
that it may not have been a democracy if Britain had not in the end shown them what democracy was.

29:59.120 --> 30:06.400
The record's not all bad. They could have left a complete shambles and a dysfunctional state.

30:09.280 --> 30:16.320
Yes. So what did the British do for India? First of all, they created it because when the British

30:16.320 --> 30:23.840
arrived in India, in the subcontinent in the 1700s, it was a mosaic of different states,

30:23.840 --> 30:31.040
different princely states speaking a variety of languages. And by the time the British left in

30:31.040 --> 30:39.840
1947, sadly, British India was divided into Pakistan and India because of religious tensions.

30:39.840 --> 30:48.160
But what was left of India was a very large unitary state in which English was widely spoken

30:48.160 --> 30:55.760
at least at certain levels. So there was a linguistic coherence. And so insofar as India

30:55.760 --> 31:01.680
now is thriving economically, the fact that there is a common language and a common state and a

31:01.680 --> 31:10.960
common market must bear some large responsibility for that. But also in terms of the rule of law,

31:12.800 --> 31:20.160
I mean, the Indian civil service under the British had reputation for very high integrity.

31:21.360 --> 31:27.280
And I don't know to what extent the Indian civil service as it is now has maintained that tradition.

31:28.080 --> 31:33.680
But if you want conditions for that are attractive to investors, then the rule of law,

31:35.600 --> 31:42.000
a lack of corruption in government, a large common market, and a common language English

31:42.000 --> 31:48.400
helps enormously is very attractive. So although it's true that the current

31:50.400 --> 31:55.200
vigor of the Indian economy owes a lot to the abandonment of socialist policies, which the

31:56.160 --> 32:02.480
immediate post independence Indian governments adopted. Nevertheless, the things the British

32:02.480 --> 32:08.880
put in place that provide conditions for a vigorous economic life.

32:09.920 --> 32:14.720
And it does raise the question, I think, as well. You often hear this story, this line that

32:14.720 --> 32:20.000
the West is responsible for the dysfunctionality of former colonies today.

32:20.880 --> 32:30.720
And it overlooks often what those countries or conglomeration of communities, which India was,

32:30.720 --> 32:38.480
I suppose, what they were really like in terms of functionality prior to the involvement of the West.

32:38.480 --> 32:49.360
One of the general benefits of Imperial authority is that it pacifies what would otherwise be

32:50.320 --> 32:56.400
a multiplicity of warring peoples. And that was certainly the case in India when the East India

32:56.400 --> 33:04.480
Company first landed there. Mughal Imperial authority had disintegrated and there was constant

33:05.200 --> 33:15.040
civil wars among Indians. And one of the effects of the expansion of the rule of the East India

33:15.040 --> 33:23.840
Company in the late 1700s was peace, and as a consequence of peace, economic prosperity.

33:23.840 --> 33:33.360
So if one person I quote in my book, John Malcolm, a Scotsman born about 50 miles east of where I

33:33.360 --> 33:44.000
was born, in fact, he was a founder member of the club in which we now sit. He went out to India in

33:44.000 --> 33:55.120
about 1780 at the age of 13. And in the around 1800, he wrote about how because of the ending

33:55.120 --> 33:59.760
of civil war and the imposition of British rule, the peasants were returning to the fields and

33:59.760 --> 34:07.600
they were coming fertile again. So the imperial imposed peace has the benefit of allowing economic

34:07.600 --> 34:14.080
life to flourish. And that was one of the benefits of the imposition of British imperial rule in

34:14.880 --> 34:22.720
India. There's an interesting counter example in Southern Africa when in 1879 the British invaded

34:22.720 --> 34:30.160
and conquered the Zulu Kingdom. And in order to break up its power because it was a highly

34:30.160 --> 34:35.120
militarized society, the British broke up the Zulu Kingdom into about a dozen different little

34:35.120 --> 34:43.760
kinglets. And sometime afterwards, some Zulu leaders were heard to complain. And they said,

34:43.760 --> 34:48.240
you know, you British, you conquer us, we get the right of conquest. Fine, you get to rule us.

34:48.880 --> 34:53.040
Now would you please do so? Because what you've done is you come here, you've conquered us,

34:53.040 --> 34:58.080
you've broken us up. And because you haven't imposed your imperial authority, we're now quarreling

34:58.080 --> 35:05.760
among one another. So again, sometimes the fault of imperial rule was it was sometimes too weak.

35:06.720 --> 35:13.280
But when it's imposed, it has the benefit of creating peace and as a consequence of that

35:13.280 --> 35:21.840
economic prosperity. Central to any account of colonialism is surely the importation of missionaries

35:22.480 --> 35:29.680
and Christianity to non-Christian lands. What did you discover in your research in this area

35:29.680 --> 35:38.800
about the relationship between Christianity and missionaries and colonialization?

35:39.600 --> 35:48.320
So you're right, John, that Christianity became important for the empire around the end of the

35:49.280 --> 35:58.320
1700s, early 1800s because of the evangelical awakening in England. And that fueled the

36:00.080 --> 36:04.160
movement for the abolition of slavery. And then it fueled concern for the plight of

36:04.160 --> 36:09.680
native peoples in likes of Australia and North America. So in that sense, it became

36:10.640 --> 36:22.880
a central and important humanizing feature. But in one sense, early on, contrary to one myth about

36:24.160 --> 36:29.440
colonialism, missionaries were not central to the project because

36:31.440 --> 36:37.120
colonial officials often found missionaries to be a nuisance. Why were they a nuisance?

36:37.120 --> 36:42.400
Well, because if you are Christian missionaries into India, for example, and they start to

36:42.400 --> 36:47.920
proselytize and preach the gospel, then Indians get upset. And the colonial officials then have

36:47.920 --> 36:54.000
to deal with the upset. So in fact, the East India Company banned missionaries until about the 1830s.

36:55.440 --> 37:02.400
So it's not true to say that Christian missionaries were sent to the lap dogs of the tool of empire.

37:02.480 --> 37:10.320
Far from it, and often you'd find missionaries in New Zealand or Africa and indeed Canada

37:11.840 --> 37:17.680
lobbying the imperial government in London to constrain the actions of colonial governments

37:17.680 --> 37:26.400
in the colonies. So missionaries could be pains in the backside to colonial governments

37:26.400 --> 37:33.680
because they were critical and often humanitarian. Now it's often, it's sometimes often thought that

37:34.880 --> 37:42.480
missionaries pushed Christianity down the throats of natives. Well, that wasn't true because missionaries

37:42.480 --> 37:51.760
didn't have the power to do that. It is true, sadly, for example, in the residential schools in

37:51.760 --> 37:58.080
Canada where native children were brought so they could learn English and agriculture. It is true

37:58.080 --> 38:06.080
that sometimes missionaries were, Christian missionaries were too zealous and too dismissive of

38:06.080 --> 38:14.960
native culture. So there was an element of cultural racism there, not always, but sometimes. But often

38:14.960 --> 38:24.240
native peoples found Christianity attractive. So Ronald Hyam, who was an historian of the British

38:24.240 --> 38:31.680
Empire, writes that in Africa, the Christian message of the brotherhood of humanity and

38:31.680 --> 38:40.000
equality in Christ was naturally enormously attractive to people in the African margins,

38:40.960 --> 38:47.120
young people, women trying, young women trying to avoid female circumcision slaves

38:48.160 --> 38:55.680
and others. And so native people sometimes found Christianity very attractive. They adopted it,

38:56.400 --> 39:01.200
they adopted it, but they also, you know, what they adopted, they also changed and adapted. So

39:02.000 --> 39:09.200
Africa and Christianity found African expression for Christianity too. So there isn't

39:09.280 --> 39:13.760
any relationship between Christianity and native peoples was a very mixed one and also

39:14.400 --> 39:19.520
between colonial authorities and missions was a very mixed one. But it's certainly not true to

39:19.520 --> 39:26.160
think of Christian missions as simply an extension of colonial oppression that's far too simplistic.

39:27.280 --> 39:33.520
What do we know about the distinctive approaches to colonisation by the different nations that

39:33.520 --> 39:39.840
engaged in it? Well, it wasn't just the British, the French, the Spanish, the Dutch, the Germans.

39:41.280 --> 39:43.600
They had different approaches. There were different outcomes.

39:45.840 --> 39:51.200
What did you find there? And what were the driving influences for their different approaches?

39:51.200 --> 39:58.000
Yes. To be frank, John, I don't, I can't claim to know enough about other European

39:58.000 --> 40:05.360
empires. I know something. So, you know, if you're an expert, compare us and go to

40:06.160 --> 40:12.480
Crescent Kumar's book, Visions of Empire, a very good book published about eight years ago.

40:13.120 --> 40:20.400
But here are some things I have picked up. I think on the negative side, I think

40:21.200 --> 40:29.040
the British were more reluctant to allow native peoples, native elites, into the top echelons

40:29.040 --> 40:36.240
of government. So in India, for example, yes, Indians were involved in governing other Indians,

40:36.240 --> 40:42.880
but not right at the top. I had the impression the French in Africa were better at integrating

40:42.880 --> 40:48.560
elites into the top. And in that respect, I think the French did better.

40:53.120 --> 41:01.600
On the other hand, the British tended to adhere to the liberal principle that

41:02.640 --> 41:07.600
colonies should become increasingly independent. And as you well know, partly because the British

41:07.600 --> 41:12.560
learnt from the American War of Independence, you can't keep tight control of colonies at the far

41:12.560 --> 41:17.120
end of the world, particularly when you take months to communicate with them. And so starting

41:17.120 --> 41:22.800
with Canada in the 1960s, and then Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa by the 1930s are

41:22.800 --> 41:28.880
virtually independent. And they have, I think, common, some common defence policies. And India's

41:28.880 --> 41:36.240
on the same track after the First World War. So the model of the British model of empire was

41:36.240 --> 41:40.640
really a kind of relaxing into a commonwealth of nations. And that phrase is used as early as the

41:40.640 --> 41:47.440
First World War, whereas the French had a model of, were integrating the colonies into France.

41:48.080 --> 41:54.320
And so to this day, French overseas territories send representatives to the Assemblee National

41:54.320 --> 42:02.480
in France. So that was another difference. And then a third point would be, whereas the British

42:03.600 --> 42:10.320
decided to devote their imperial power in part to the abolition of slavery all of the world,

42:10.400 --> 42:18.320
so yes, the British were involved in slave trading and slavery from 1650 to about to the 1800s. But

42:18.320 --> 42:25.680
then from the early 1800s onwards, the empire for the second half of its life was committed to

42:25.680 --> 42:31.600
abolishing slavery from Brazil across Africa, India, and Malaysia. And that also included

42:31.920 --> 42:40.720
abolishing slavery in South Africa, which the British took over from the Dutch around 1804,

42:40.720 --> 42:48.640
I think, because the Dutch had been importing slaves from Malaysia into South Africa. And for

42:48.640 --> 42:59.360
that reason, some Dutch Africanas, or became known as Boers, meaning farmer, they were so

43:00.000 --> 43:06.320
upset at the British suppression of slavery that they left Cape Colony, which the British controlled,

43:06.320 --> 43:11.600
and created their own African Republics, the Transvaal and the Orange Free State.

43:12.720 --> 43:20.720
So on that point, Dutch colonists and British colonialism differed in terms of the treatment

43:20.720 --> 43:28.160
of Native Africans. And that was why when the Second Anglo-Bore War broke out in 1899,

43:29.120 --> 43:33.280
black Africans as well as black African Americans tended to support the British.

43:34.400 --> 43:41.760
I think there's often an assumption that colonisation involved great cruelty and violence,

43:44.000 --> 43:49.120
that it was about military takeovers, if you like, and the squashing of people.

43:50.640 --> 43:56.240
I don't think it's as simple as that. I think, as you've said, there were various motives,

43:56.320 --> 43:59.440
various different approaches taken at various times by the British.

44:01.040 --> 44:07.040
But I also wonder whether the sort of policies that different countries ran

44:08.640 --> 44:15.360
reflected different ideas about treating Indigenous people decently.

44:18.240 --> 44:25.520
So there's no doubt, John, that in the history of the British Empire, there's a lot of violence.

44:26.720 --> 44:33.680
But we need to put that in context because you and I are privileged to live in parts of the

44:33.680 --> 44:43.520
world that enjoy unprecedented peace and health and wealth and security. And we live in countries

44:43.520 --> 44:48.400
that have strong states that can afford to be very careful about how much violence they use,

44:48.400 --> 44:53.520
because they don't have to use too much of it. But in the past, where states,

44:54.480 --> 45:03.360
colonial governments are weak, where borders are uncertain, there was a lot of conflict,

45:03.360 --> 45:11.600
a lot of violence. But the past was just, it was much more insecure. And where people are insecure,

45:12.800 --> 45:16.560
they don't give other benefits of doubt and there's more violence. So let's just take that as red.

45:17.680 --> 45:22.400
How did the British Empire compare to other empires in terms of violence? Well,

45:24.240 --> 45:29.680
to take one infamous case, you've got the Belgian Empire and the Congo, which,

45:31.520 --> 45:39.040
colony in the Congo, which was notoriously cruel to black Africans. Although to be fair,

45:39.040 --> 45:45.280
as I understand it, that wasn't actually a colony of the Belgian state. It was actually

45:45.280 --> 45:51.440
a private fiefdom of King Leopold. So you might want to say that was the Belgian

45:51.440 --> 45:59.280
support of just the kings. That's a fine point. Then the other allegedly notoriously

46:03.120 --> 46:11.760
cruel expression of European colonialism was in German South East Africa,

46:12.880 --> 46:20.000
where it is widely supposed that the Germans perpetrated a genocide there.

46:20.000 --> 46:24.640
Now that's controversial. I have a colleague and friend to the right of me, Bruce Gilley,

46:24.640 --> 46:29.040
who was argued forcefully that that wasn't the case, but it's widely held to be the case.

46:30.560 --> 46:40.640
And then you've got the Japanese when they invaded China, famously the rape of Nanjing or

46:40.640 --> 46:47.600
Nanking, where no one knows how many, but several hundred thousand Chinese civilians were killed

46:47.600 --> 46:53.920
by Japanese troops. And it is notable therefore that in the Second World War,

46:56.320 --> 47:05.200
probably the greatest, yes without a doubt, the greatest number of troops in the British

47:05.200 --> 47:13.280
Empire were Indian. And Indian troops were all volunteers. And although Indian troops were

47:13.360 --> 47:19.920
deployed in North Africa and in Italy during the Second World War, most of them were fighting

47:19.920 --> 47:27.600
the Japanese in Burma and India. And they chose to fight with the British against the Japanese. Why?

47:28.800 --> 47:31.920
Not because they wanted the British to stay and rule them forever,

47:33.840 --> 47:37.280
but they sure as damn didn't want the Japanese to rule them because they read the papers,

47:37.280 --> 47:45.040
they heard the reports of what the Japanese did in China in Manchuria. And compared to the

47:45.040 --> 47:54.320
Japanese, the British were to Indians at that time far preferable. And as I said, as we discussed

47:54.320 --> 48:00.160
earlier, I don't think the British were responsible for perpetrating genocide in Tasmania or anywhere

48:00.160 --> 48:08.480
else. Whereas it seems that in some cases, European empires did commit genocide.

48:10.880 --> 48:17.920
So we hear endlessly that there are endless negatives about what Britain in particular

48:17.920 --> 48:24.320
has done in the rest of the world in the name of colonialism. And you've been very honest about

48:24.320 --> 48:32.880
some of those failings. Can we get a handle on the good news, the positives, as you discover them

48:32.880 --> 48:40.320
to be? Yeah. So in the conclusion to my book, I draw up two lists of, I draw up as it were,

48:40.320 --> 48:45.120
the debit column in the ledger and then the credit column. The credit column is actually longer.

48:46.880 --> 48:51.280
So here are some of the items in the credit ledger. We talked about anti-slavery and this was a

48:51.840 --> 48:56.400
consistent policy for 150 years for the second half of the empire's life.

48:59.040 --> 49:06.400
There was also the imposition of peace, I mentioned. Native peoples did benefit from

49:07.040 --> 49:14.560
the imposition of a pure authority which subdued warfare between natives.

49:15.520 --> 49:24.640
There was also the establishment of the rule of law. I was in Shanghai in China a few years ago and

49:25.280 --> 49:30.560
met a young couple from Singapore. And as soon as Daniel had introduced himself to me, he said,

49:31.600 --> 49:35.920
any prompting, he said, we in Singapore are grateful to you, British, for the rule of law.

49:36.320 --> 49:46.800
And another anecdote I have related to that is I had a Chinese colleague from Hong Kong visiting

49:46.800 --> 49:57.440
me in Oxford and I said to him, so, Pingchong, what do you think about the British legacy,

49:58.240 --> 50:06.640
the colonial legacy in Hong Kong? And he said, well, if in the 1950s or 60s,

50:06.640 --> 50:13.040
China had been a liberal democracy, Hong Kong wouldn't look so good. But in the 50s, late 50s,

50:13.680 --> 50:21.440
early 50s, China was in a state of anarchy and civil war and that's why you had a million or two

50:21.440 --> 50:28.320
Chinese, no one knows how many, fleeing mainland China, coming into the non-democratic colony of

50:28.320 --> 50:36.480
Hong Kong. Why? Because at least there there was the rule of law which provides life with

50:36.480 --> 50:41.920
predictability and you can at least have sufficient stability to flourish there.

50:42.640 --> 50:46.160
So the establishment of the rule of law was really important, very important for foreign

50:46.160 --> 50:53.760
investment. The British up until 1929, I think, invested more overseas than any other European

50:53.760 --> 51:00.240
country and investors don't invest unless the environment is secure, because otherwise they

51:00.240 --> 51:06.320
risk losing their investment. So the establishment of the rule of law stable government encouraged

51:06.320 --> 51:15.120
investment in India and Africa and Australia and North America. And not least thanks to that,

51:17.440 --> 51:28.640
look at what the British Empire grew up. So the United States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand

51:29.520 --> 51:36.080
and indeed Israel, some of the most prosperous, stable liberal countries in the world, all of them

51:37.040 --> 51:46.720
were progeny of the British Empire. So I think there are quite a large number of benefits that

51:46.720 --> 51:55.600
the Empire conferred upon various parts of the world. He's a novel thought. There are probably

51:57.360 --> 52:05.200
not a few people who wouldn't mind a little British rule of law today. Yes, in the sense that

52:06.080 --> 52:12.480
we hear endless condemnation of Britain in relation to the slave trade, but nobody seems

52:12.480 --> 52:20.320
to care about the 45 to 50 million slaves around the world today. Yes. It says something very

52:20.320 --> 52:25.360
profound that we want to revisit the past, whereas in fact the story there is not as people believe

52:25.360 --> 52:32.800
it and ignore the fact that there's a great need for people to stand up now as the anti-slavery

52:32.800 --> 52:38.320
campaigners in Britain did so effectively a couple of hundred years ago. No, that's absolutely

52:38.320 --> 52:45.040
right. And let's be clear, the reason why some people wanted to focus on the sins of slavery,

52:45.040 --> 52:52.480
which were sins, is political. And people wanted to focus on the evils of colonialism because it is

52:52.480 --> 53:02.560
politically useful as a kind of lever to achieve things politically. But the whole truth is all

53:02.560 --> 53:07.520
together more mixed. And I think it's really important politically we get our history right,

53:07.520 --> 53:15.760
otherwise we're susceptible to false guilt and we embark on well-meaning but ill-judged policies.

53:15.760 --> 53:24.240
So let's get the history right. We live in a culture now where there's an extraordinary,

53:24.240 --> 53:37.760
almost self-loathing of everything that we are and a quite noticeable manipulation of history

53:38.640 --> 53:45.120
to support a narrative that we should be ashamed of what has gone before us.

53:46.480 --> 53:49.680
And I think that is playing out very badly for young people.

53:49.680 --> 53:59.520
What advice would you give that's a sort of a question from left field to parents and influencers

53:59.520 --> 54:10.960
and so forth when it comes to trying to help their children develop a more balanced approach,

54:10.960 --> 54:15.280
because it seems to be critically important to me. The point you made earlier, we're all a mixture

54:15.280 --> 54:20.800
of good and bad. It's never as simple as black and white. And if you believe it is, you fall

54:20.800 --> 54:25.840
under this terrible trap of thinking the world is just, life is just one long battle between good

54:25.840 --> 54:31.680
people and bad people. Yes. And if you believe the story is told about our colonial past,

54:31.680 --> 54:36.320
then it was nothing but a litany of racism and oppression and violence. And that has to shake

54:36.320 --> 54:44.320
your confidence in the nation states and the institutions that we built. Everything comes

54:44.720 --> 54:54.000
under question because our states were involved in this imperial oppression and wickedness.

54:54.720 --> 54:59.120
So it's really important that the whole truth be told and the whole truth is that the British

54:59.120 --> 55:04.080
Empire, for example, did some very good things as well as some very bad things.

55:05.760 --> 55:10.160
And so what advice will I give? Well, obviously the first piece of advice I give is read my book,

55:10.960 --> 55:17.440
because even if you don't agree with the moral argument I make, and I try at the end of the

55:17.440 --> 55:23.600
book to come to an overall judgment about the British Empire morally, even if you don't agree

55:23.600 --> 55:28.400
with that, in the course of the book, you will learn a lot about what actually happened.

55:29.680 --> 55:39.200
And part of the problem today, the reason why this relentlessly negative reading of our

55:39.840 --> 55:45.760
colonial past has taken root, particularly in the educated elite and the media institutions,

55:46.480 --> 55:52.480
is that no one knows the history. So if activists come along and say it was all racism and genocide,

55:53.040 --> 55:59.120
no one knows enough to contradict them. So my first piece of advice is a part of parents of

55:59.120 --> 56:05.360
teachers read something, read my book. The other book I'd recommend is Neil Ferguson's

56:06.320 --> 56:12.880
book entitled Simply Empire, published 20 years ago. I re-read it recently. It's still good,

56:12.880 --> 56:20.400
and besides, unlike mine, it's got pictures. So do that. The other resource would be the

56:20.400 --> 56:26.480
website of a body called History Reclaimed, which is based in this country. It's run by Robert

56:26.560 --> 56:31.520
Toomes out of Cambridge University, or it's not a Cambridge University

56:33.920 --> 56:42.080
entity, but he's at Cambridge and he runs it. And this is designed to get historians to write

56:42.080 --> 56:48.400
material that is more balanced and provides the other side of the story. And there's lots of

56:48.400 --> 56:55.920
stuff up on the website. So I'd really recommend that parents and teachers of history look at

56:55.920 --> 57:04.640
that website, which is universally available. I put a proposition to you, then, and just to test it.

57:06.400 --> 57:11.840
You could argue that the means by which Britain became the most powerful nation on Earth, as it

57:11.840 --> 57:18.080
was for a very long time, contained some bad stories as well as some good stories and some

57:18.080 --> 57:25.440
indifferent stories. But it needs to be balanced by the reality that then Britain became the

57:25.440 --> 57:32.160
first and only empire of its type to actually abolish slavery, so far as I'm aware. And it was

57:32.160 --> 57:39.520
able to take on the role of ending it beyond its own economy and peoples because it was big and

57:39.520 --> 57:48.880
powerful. So there's two sides to that one story alone. Yes. So Britain was not the first to

57:48.880 --> 57:54.320
abolish the safer Denmark was, but in Northwest Europe, you have a number of nations that come

57:54.320 --> 58:00.400
to the view for the first time in the history of the world that slavery as such is unacceptable.

58:01.280 --> 58:06.800
And then Britain, because after the end of the Napoleonic wars in the 15th, Britain then becomes

58:06.800 --> 58:12.560
for a century, or just over a century, the most powerful nation in the world. Britain devotes

58:13.840 --> 58:18.800
a lot of its imperial power to suppressing slavery across the world. In the 1820s and 30s,

58:18.800 --> 58:24.160
the slave trade department was the largest in the British Foreign Office. Around 1840,

58:24.160 --> 58:30.560
50, the Royal Navy devoted 13% of its total manpower just as oppressing the slave trade across

58:30.560 --> 58:37.120
the Atlantic from West Africa to the Americas. So there's that. There's also the fact that,

58:38.000 --> 58:45.600
as I said earlier, the British realized, or some British realized that the empire could not consist

58:45.600 --> 58:53.920
of a tightly controlled centralized state. So the Britain tightly controls the destinies of

58:53.920 --> 59:02.400
peoples in Australia and Africa and North America. And so there was a recognition. And in fact,

59:02.400 --> 59:10.400
in the 1820s and in India, Bombay and Calcutta and Madras are all governed by Scotsman. And every

59:10.400 --> 59:15.040
one of the Scotsman says, folks, we can't be here forever. All we can hope to do

59:15.920 --> 59:22.000
is to help the Indians develop decent government, and then we should leave with grace and hopefully

59:22.000 --> 59:27.760
good will. And that view was embodied in the developing Commonwealth idea, as I said earlier,

59:27.760 --> 59:32.480
whereby the empire relaxes into a family of independent nations, which is what it's become.

59:33.440 --> 59:38.320
And I think that stands to that's the kind of liberal, a liberal vision of the destiny of

59:38.320 --> 59:42.480
empire. And that, I think, is creditable. And then the last thing I'd say is,

59:44.960 --> 59:54.640
remember how the British Empire exhausted itself. 1939 to 45. Doing what? Fighting the massively

59:54.640 --> 01:00:02.480
murderous racist regime in Hitler's Berlin. And between May 1941, France fell, and June

01:00:03.440 --> 01:00:09.840
June 41, when Hitler invaded Russia, the British Empire offered the only military

01:00:09.840 --> 01:00:16.160
resistance to Nazism with the solo exception of Greece. And that has to say something good

01:00:16.160 --> 01:00:20.160
about what the empire had become and what, when push came to shove, what it stood for.

01:00:21.760 --> 01:00:27.040
To its end, like every political body, it contained both good and bad, virtual advice.

01:00:27.840 --> 01:00:34.560
But I think the fact that, thanks to the moral integrity and wisdom of Winston Churchill,

01:00:35.360 --> 01:00:40.560
Britain and the empire, and you know very well, and we British know now too,

01:00:41.280 --> 01:00:47.120
the efforts to defeat Hitler was an imperial effort. Your father was North Africa, mine was in

01:00:47.120 --> 01:00:53.360
Italy. He was mistaken for an Indian because the Indian division was off to his right in Italy,

01:00:53.360 --> 01:01:00.560
not India. It was a remarkable multinational effort. And that was devoted to defeating,

01:01:00.560 --> 01:01:07.680
not only Imperial Japan, but also Nazi Germany. And that, I think, if you're going to lose an

01:01:07.680 --> 01:01:14.560
empire, I can't think of a better way to do it. Well, thank you very much. That's a great note

01:01:14.560 --> 01:01:21.840
to end on. We need to recognise that history can teach us a great deal, but we need to know what

01:01:21.840 --> 01:01:35.360
the history actually is. Absolutely. So please read my book.
