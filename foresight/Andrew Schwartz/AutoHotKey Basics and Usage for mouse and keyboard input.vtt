Alright, what's going on guys, Drew here from TechCubed and in this video we're going to

00:11.200 --> 00:15.480
be going over the basics and some of the more common uses for auto hockey.

00:15.480 --> 00:20.440
So in my last video I showed what I personally use auto hockey for, the way I edit my gaming

00:20.440 --> 00:23.960
mouse for productivity in my laptop.

00:23.960 --> 00:27.760
So what I'm going to do now is basically go over the basics, how to start a file, how

00:27.760 --> 00:31.520
to edit it, and I do some of the more basic features and kind of go more in depth of what

00:31.520 --> 00:32.520
I showed last time.

00:32.520 --> 00:37.920
So the first thing you want to do is go to any finder window where you have files.

00:37.920 --> 00:41.760
First thing you want to do is go to any finder window and then you're going to right click

00:41.760 --> 00:43.480
and you're going to go to new.

00:43.480 --> 00:47.280
And under new you're going to see many options and assuming you have auto hockey downloaded

00:47.280 --> 00:49.880
correctly you're going to have an auto hockey script button.

00:49.880 --> 00:57.480
So you click that and now you can name whatever you want, just test script for me and enter.

00:57.480 --> 01:01.280
And once you name it in order to open it you can't double click it like you normally think

01:01.280 --> 01:02.280
for other files.

01:02.280 --> 01:05.760
What you got to do is right click it and then find edit script.

01:05.760 --> 01:09.800
Once you do that it's going to open it up, it opened up on my other monitor, sorry, right

01:09.800 --> 01:10.800
down here.

01:10.800 --> 01:13.840
And it's got a little bit of test code in it, I don't think it does anything, you can just

01:13.840 --> 01:15.160
delete it all.

01:15.160 --> 01:19.600
So the first thing that we could do is actually jump in and do kind of a simple command where

01:19.600 --> 01:22.760
when you write some text it's going to replace it with another.

01:22.760 --> 01:25.920
So what we're going to do, this looks a little bit different than the code from my other

01:25.920 --> 01:27.520
video, but it's fairly basic.

01:27.520 --> 01:33.920
All you do is put in a colon and then a star and another colon and now here's actually

01:33.920 --> 01:36.360
where the key goes.

01:36.360 --> 01:43.640
So let's say every time we type the letter U it's going to type YOU.

01:43.640 --> 01:45.200
So it's like a texting format.

01:45.200 --> 01:50.920
So what actually is going on here is when the user types U it's going to replace it

01:50.920 --> 01:52.360
with U.

01:52.360 --> 01:57.520
So anything on the left side here, when we click that it's going to place it on the right

01:57.520 --> 01:59.840
side of these two colons.

01:59.840 --> 02:05.160
Now the relevance of this part is that it means once we type U there's no need for an

02:05.160 --> 02:07.920
extra key to be pushed, it's just going to do it right away no matter what.

02:07.920 --> 02:13.880
So we can actually save this, ctrl-S or file save and we want to run this and the way to

02:13.880 --> 02:19.320
run it is going back to our window here and double clicking on your script.

02:19.320 --> 02:23.080
So instead of double clicking to open, it double clicks to run and you right click to

02:23.080 --> 02:24.080
edit.

02:24.080 --> 02:26.520
And you'll see here a little hockey shows up.

02:26.520 --> 02:30.880
So now hopefully if we go back anywhere typing or here if you type letter U it's going to

02:30.880 --> 02:32.120
fix it with U.

02:32.120 --> 02:36.720
So you won't even see my U, it's just going to replace it with YOU.

02:36.720 --> 02:37.720
So that's that.

02:37.720 --> 02:40.640
You can do this with any type of key that you want and you can do this with multiple.

02:40.640 --> 02:45.520
So let's say YOU, you want to make it U, I don't know why you'd want to do that.

02:45.520 --> 02:47.760
Oh and actually I can't type that.

02:47.760 --> 02:52.000
You want to make it U, you can save this, ctrl-S, go and run it again.

02:52.000 --> 02:55.080
It's going to ask you if you want to replace it, just say yes no big deal and we can go

02:55.080 --> 02:58.760
back and if you type YOU, it also replaces it to you.

02:58.760 --> 03:02.080
So YOU, that's what's going to happen.

03:02.080 --> 03:06.760
Alright so the next feature that we can use is clicking buttons.

03:06.760 --> 03:11.960
So in the last video I talked about the mouse a lot so I'll just review that real quick.

03:11.960 --> 03:17.280
So let's say we want to replace one of our extra buttons on a gaming mouse, either the

03:17.280 --> 03:22.400
button 4, button 5 as we call here X button 1 and X button 2 and we want it to click

03:22.400 --> 03:24.120
the left button or the right button.

03:24.120 --> 03:32.520
It's no big deal, all you do is type X button 1 or 2 if you'd like, no different and then

03:32.520 --> 03:36.680
you do two columns again meaning anything on the left of the column is what it's waiting

03:36.680 --> 03:40.000
for and anything on the right of the column is what it's going to do.

03:40.000 --> 03:42.720
So we can type something, for instance, hello or hi.

03:42.720 --> 03:48.680
So what you do is type send after a space and now anything you wanted to type, so hello.

03:48.680 --> 03:55.280
So save that and go and run it and now you can see when we run this, by clicking that

03:55.280 --> 03:57.800
button it's going to do hello each time.

03:57.800 --> 04:01.360
So that's pretty cool but there's many other things we could do, for instance what I personally

04:01.360 --> 04:05.200
do, let's say when you click it, is the windows key.

04:05.200 --> 04:11.400
So we could keep send up there and now in curly braces type win, since there's two windows

04:11.400 --> 04:16.880
keys on some laptops, some computers, I wanted to specify left windows because that's all

04:16.880 --> 04:21.920
mine actually has and then when you run that, you can see when I click it, it goes to the

04:21.920 --> 04:23.420
start screen.

04:23.420 --> 04:28.800
So that's it for that, now there's many other options here, for instance, I got a comment

04:28.800 --> 04:36.400
once about how to, when this button is pushed, how to use the left click, so to do that you

04:36.400 --> 04:46.200
do click, comma, left, okay, you could save that, run it and now what you'll see is whenever

04:46.200 --> 04:51.440
I click this button, it changes the windows, that's basically the best way to show, I promise

04:51.440 --> 04:55.480
I'm not hitting the left click mouse, it's from here.

04:55.480 --> 04:58.920
So the only issue with this is that it's not going to press and hold like you'd imagine

04:58.920 --> 05:02.240
with the normal left click, so you can't do this dragging feature, it's only going to

05:02.240 --> 05:04.840
click and there you go, that's how that works.

05:04.840 --> 05:09.560
So one last thing I'd like to say is how I personally use auto hockey, rather than using

05:09.560 --> 05:13.240
this file folder where I have to open it up every time and double click in order to open

05:13.240 --> 05:14.240
it up.

05:14.240 --> 05:17.640
So anytime you start the computer, it's going to restart auto hockey and it's not going to

05:17.640 --> 05:18.640
auto run it.

05:18.640 --> 05:23.520
So what I do rather than opening up this folder here, I actually put it on my desktop.

05:23.520 --> 05:28.760
So if you see right here, I have main settings right here, and when I double click that it's

05:28.760 --> 05:32.520
going to run it and that's all the files that I like on a daily basis.

05:32.520 --> 05:37.160
So I'd highly recommend that you drag your test script to the desktop so you can use

05:37.160 --> 05:41.000
it there anytime your computer starts, okay?

05:41.000 --> 05:44.520
So I hope you enjoyed this video guys, any other questions you have, check down below.

05:44.520 --> 05:47.960
If you haven't seen my previous video, please check that out and I'd be more than happy to

05:47.960 --> 05:51.960
take suggestions for future auto hockey videos and if you'd like to learn Android, I got

05:51.960 --> 05:54.600
videos about those or Blender animation.

05:54.600 --> 05:56.360
So thank you guys for watching and I'll see you guys next time.
