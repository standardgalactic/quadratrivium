0	11200	Alright, what's going on guys, Drew here from TechCubed and in this video we're going to
11200	15480	be going over the basics and some of the more common uses for auto hockey.
15480	20440	So in my last video I showed what I personally use auto hockey for, the way I edit my gaming
20440	23960	mouse for productivity in my laptop.
23960	27760	So what I'm going to do now is basically go over the basics, how to start a file, how
27760	31520	to edit it, and I do some of the more basic features and kind of go more in depth of what
31520	32520	I showed last time.
32520	37920	So the first thing you want to do is go to any finder window where you have files.
37920	41760	First thing you want to do is go to any finder window and then you're going to right click
41760	43480	and you're going to go to new.
43480	47280	And under new you're going to see many options and assuming you have auto hockey downloaded
47280	49880	correctly you're going to have an auto hockey script button.
49880	57480	So you click that and now you can name whatever you want, just test script for me and enter.
57480	61280	And once you name it in order to open it you can't double click it like you normally think
61280	62280	for other files.
62280	65760	What you got to do is right click it and then find edit script.
65760	69800	Once you do that it's going to open it up, it opened up on my other monitor, sorry, right
69800	70800	down here.
70800	73840	And it's got a little bit of test code in it, I don't think it does anything, you can just
73840	75160	delete it all.
75160	79600	So the first thing that we could do is actually jump in and do kind of a simple command where
79600	82760	when you write some text it's going to replace it with another.
82760	85920	So what we're going to do, this looks a little bit different than the code from my other
85920	87520	video, but it's fairly basic.
87520	93920	All you do is put in a colon and then a star and another colon and now here's actually
93920	96360	where the key goes.
96360	103640	So let's say every time we type the letter U it's going to type YOU.
103640	105200	So it's like a texting format.
105200	110920	So what actually is going on here is when the user types U it's going to replace it
110920	112360	with U.
112360	117520	So anything on the left side here, when we click that it's going to place it on the right
117520	119840	side of these two colons.
119840	125160	Now the relevance of this part is that it means once we type U there's no need for an
125160	127920	extra key to be pushed, it's just going to do it right away no matter what.
127920	133880	So we can actually save this, ctrl-S or file save and we want to run this and the way to
133880	139320	run it is going back to our window here and double clicking on your script.
139320	143080	So instead of double clicking to open, it double clicks to run and you right click to
143080	144080	edit.
144080	146520	And you'll see here a little hockey shows up.
146520	150880	So now hopefully if we go back anywhere typing or here if you type letter U it's going to
150880	152120	fix it with U.
152120	156720	So you won't even see my U, it's just going to replace it with YOU.
156720	157720	So that's that.
157720	160640	You can do this with any type of key that you want and you can do this with multiple.
160640	165520	So let's say YOU, you want to make it U, I don't know why you'd want to do that.
165520	167760	Oh and actually I can't type that.
167760	172000	You want to make it U, you can save this, ctrl-S, go and run it again.
172000	175080	It's going to ask you if you want to replace it, just say yes no big deal and we can go
175080	178760	back and if you type YOU, it also replaces it to you.
178760	182080	So YOU, that's what's going to happen.
182080	186760	Alright so the next feature that we can use is clicking buttons.
186760	191960	So in the last video I talked about the mouse a lot so I'll just review that real quick.
191960	197280	So let's say we want to replace one of our extra buttons on a gaming mouse, either the
197280	202400	button 4, button 5 as we call here X button 1 and X button 2 and we want it to click
202400	204120	the left button or the right button.
204120	212520	It's no big deal, all you do is type X button 1 or 2 if you'd like, no different and then
212520	216680	you do two columns again meaning anything on the left of the column is what it's waiting
216680	220000	for and anything on the right of the column is what it's going to do.
220000	222720	So we can type something, for instance, hello or hi.
222720	228680	So what you do is type send after a space and now anything you wanted to type, so hello.
228680	235280	So save that and go and run it and now you can see when we run this, by clicking that
235280	237800	button it's going to do hello each time.
237800	241360	So that's pretty cool but there's many other things we could do, for instance what I personally
241360	245200	do, let's say when you click it, is the windows key.
245200	251400	So we could keep send up there and now in curly braces type win, since there's two windows
251400	256880	keys on some laptops, some computers, I wanted to specify left windows because that's all
256880	261920	mine actually has and then when you run that, you can see when I click it, it goes to the
261920	263420	start screen.
263420	268800	So that's it for that, now there's many other options here, for instance, I got a comment
268800	276400	once about how to, when this button is pushed, how to use the left click, so to do that you
276400	286200	do click, comma, left, okay, you could save that, run it and now what you'll see is whenever
286200	291440	I click this button, it changes the windows, that's basically the best way to show, I promise
291440	295480	I'm not hitting the left click mouse, it's from here.
295480	298920	So the only issue with this is that it's not going to press and hold like you'd imagine
298920	302240	with the normal left click, so you can't do this dragging feature, it's only going to
302240	304840	click and there you go, that's how that works.
304840	309560	So one last thing I'd like to say is how I personally use auto hockey, rather than using
309560	313240	this file folder where I have to open it up every time and double click in order to open
313240	314240	it up.
314240	317640	So anytime you start the computer, it's going to restart auto hockey and it's not going to
317640	318640	auto run it.
318640	323520	So what I do rather than opening up this folder here, I actually put it on my desktop.
323520	328760	So if you see right here, I have main settings right here, and when I double click that it's
328760	332520	going to run it and that's all the files that I like on a daily basis.
332520	337160	So I'd highly recommend that you drag your test script to the desktop so you can use
337160	341000	it there anytime your computer starts, okay?
341000	344520	So I hope you enjoyed this video guys, any other questions you have, check down below.
344520	347960	If you haven't seen my previous video, please check that out and I'd be more than happy to
347960	351960	take suggestions for future auto hockey videos and if you'd like to learn Android, I got
351960	354600	videos about those or Blender animation.
354600	356360	So thank you guys for watching and I'll see you guys next time.
