00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,200
Alright, what's going on guys, Drew here from TechCubed and in this video we're going to

2
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:15,480
be going over the basics and some of the more common uses for auto hockey.

3
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:20,440
So in my last video I showed what I personally use auto hockey for, the way I edit my gaming

4
00:00:20,440 --> 00:00:23,960
mouse for productivity in my laptop.

5
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:27,760
So what I'm going to do now is basically go over the basics, how to start a file, how

6
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:31,520
to edit it, and I do some of the more basic features and kind of go more in depth of what

7
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:32,520
I showed last time.

8
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:37,920
So the first thing you want to do is go to any finder window where you have files.

9
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:41,760
First thing you want to do is go to any finder window and then you're going to right click

10
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:43,480
and you're going to go to new.

11
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:47,280
And under new you're going to see many options and assuming you have auto hockey downloaded

12
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:49,880
correctly you're going to have an auto hockey script button.

13
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:57,480
So you click that and now you can name whatever you want, just test script for me and enter.

14
00:00:57,480 --> 00:01:01,280
And once you name it in order to open it you can't double click it like you normally think

15
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:02,280
for other files.

16
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:05,760
What you got to do is right click it and then find edit script.

17
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:09,800
Once you do that it's going to open it up, it opened up on my other monitor, sorry, right

18
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:10,800
down here.

19
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:13,840
And it's got a little bit of test code in it, I don't think it does anything, you can just

20
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:15,160
delete it all.

21
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:19,600
So the first thing that we could do is actually jump in and do kind of a simple command where

22
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:22,760
when you write some text it's going to replace it with another.

23
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:25,920
So what we're going to do, this looks a little bit different than the code from my other

24
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:27,520
video, but it's fairly basic.

25
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:33,920
All you do is put in a colon and then a star and another colon and now here's actually

26
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:36,360
where the key goes.

27
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:43,640
So let's say every time we type the letter U it's going to type YOU.

28
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:45,200
So it's like a texting format.

29
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:50,920
So what actually is going on here is when the user types U it's going to replace it

30
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:52,360
with U.

31
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:57,520
So anything on the left side here, when we click that it's going to place it on the right

32
00:01:57,520 --> 00:01:59,840
side of these two colons.

33
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:05,160
Now the relevance of this part is that it means once we type U there's no need for an

34
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:07,920
extra key to be pushed, it's just going to do it right away no matter what.

35
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:13,880
So we can actually save this, ctrl-S or file save and we want to run this and the way to

36
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:19,320
run it is going back to our window here and double clicking on your script.

37
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:23,080
So instead of double clicking to open, it double clicks to run and you right click to

38
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:24,080
edit.

39
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:26,520
And you'll see here a little hockey shows up.

40
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:30,880
So now hopefully if we go back anywhere typing or here if you type letter U it's going to

41
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:32,120
fix it with U.

42
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:36,720
So you won't even see my U, it's just going to replace it with YOU.

43
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:37,720
So that's that.

44
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:40,640
You can do this with any type of key that you want and you can do this with multiple.

45
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:45,520
So let's say YOU, you want to make it U, I don't know why you'd want to do that.

46
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:47,760
Oh and actually I can't type that.

47
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:52,000
You want to make it U, you can save this, ctrl-S, go and run it again.

48
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,080
It's going to ask you if you want to replace it, just say yes no big deal and we can go

49
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:58,760
back and if you type YOU, it also replaces it to you.

50
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:02,080
So YOU, that's what's going to happen.

51
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:06,760
Alright so the next feature that we can use is clicking buttons.

52
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:11,960
So in the last video I talked about the mouse a lot so I'll just review that real quick.

53
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:17,280
So let's say we want to replace one of our extra buttons on a gaming mouse, either the

54
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:22,400
button 4, button 5 as we call here X button 1 and X button 2 and we want it to click

55
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:24,120
the left button or the right button.

56
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:32,520
It's no big deal, all you do is type X button 1 or 2 if you'd like, no different and then

57
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:36,680
you do two columns again meaning anything on the left of the column is what it's waiting

58
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:40,000
for and anything on the right of the column is what it's going to do.

59
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,720
So we can type something, for instance, hello or hi.

60
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:48,680
So what you do is type send after a space and now anything you wanted to type, so hello.

61
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:55,280
So save that and go and run it and now you can see when we run this, by clicking that

62
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:57,800
button it's going to do hello each time.

63
00:03:57,800 --> 00:04:01,360
So that's pretty cool but there's many other things we could do, for instance what I personally

64
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:05,200
do, let's say when you click it, is the windows key.

65
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:11,400
So we could keep send up there and now in curly braces type win, since there's two windows

66
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:16,880
keys on some laptops, some computers, I wanted to specify left windows because that's all

67
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:21,920
mine actually has and then when you run that, you can see when I click it, it goes to the

68
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:23,420
start screen.

69
00:04:23,420 --> 00:04:28,800
So that's it for that, now there's many other options here, for instance, I got a comment

70
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:36,400
once about how to, when this button is pushed, how to use the left click, so to do that you

71
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:46,200
do click, comma, left, okay, you could save that, run it and now what you'll see is whenever

72
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:51,440
I click this button, it changes the windows, that's basically the best way to show, I promise

73
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:55,480
I'm not hitting the left click mouse, it's from here.

74
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:58,920
So the only issue with this is that it's not going to press and hold like you'd imagine

75
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:02,240
with the normal left click, so you can't do this dragging feature, it's only going to

76
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:04,840
click and there you go, that's how that works.

77
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:09,560
So one last thing I'd like to say is how I personally use auto hockey, rather than using

78
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:13,240
this file folder where I have to open it up every time and double click in order to open

79
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:14,240
it up.

80
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:17,640
So anytime you start the computer, it's going to restart auto hockey and it's not going to

81
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:18,640
auto run it.

82
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:23,520
So what I do rather than opening up this folder here, I actually put it on my desktop.

83
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:28,760
So if you see right here, I have main settings right here, and when I double click that it's

84
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:32,520
going to run it and that's all the files that I like on a daily basis.

85
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:37,160
So I'd highly recommend that you drag your test script to the desktop so you can use

86
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:41,000
it there anytime your computer starts, okay?

87
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:44,520
So I hope you enjoyed this video guys, any other questions you have, check down below.

88
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:47,960
If you haven't seen my previous video, please check that out and I'd be more than happy to

89
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:51,960
take suggestions for future auto hockey videos and if you'd like to learn Android, I got

90
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:54,600
videos about those or Blender animation.

91
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:56,360
So thank you guys for watching and I'll see you guys next time.
