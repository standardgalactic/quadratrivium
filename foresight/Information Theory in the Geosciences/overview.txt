Checking Information Theory in the Geosciences/Session 37 - Large language models (LLMs) and Causality.txt
1. The discussion revolved around the role of artificial intelligence in evaluating models, particularly those related to natural disasters like flood events. The challenge lies in finding metrics that can effectively assess the output of these models, which are complex and not easily quantifiable.

2. A potential solution involves using large language models (LLMs) to evaluate other LLMs, but there's an inherent bias in doing so. This raises a question about how to objectively measure the performance of such models.

3. The presenter mentioned that they will be presenting their work on this topic at the AGU conference, specifically during a morning session on Monday. They also offered to share a comprehensive list of talks happening at AGU, which includes participants from the SNF in the House workshop.

4. The spreadsheet contains details such as the ID and title of each talk, along with the names of speakers (indicated by double marks). It serves as a guide for attendees to navigate through the vast array of talks at AGU.

5. The presenter pointed out that managing time effectively is crucial when attending conferences like AGU, where there are multiple sessions and talks to consider.

6. The conversation also touched on education, particularly how student exams often test for rote memorization rather than deeper understanding or the ability to generalize knowledge. This connects to the importance of causal reasoning and the evaluation of AI models.

7. Finally, the group discussed their upcoming winter break and looked forward to Manuel's presentation upon their return on January 17.
