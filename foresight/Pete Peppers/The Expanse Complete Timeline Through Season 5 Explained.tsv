0	6520	More than two billion years before the protomolecule was discovered in our solar system, it was
6520	11880	created by an advanced civilization we refer to as the Ringbuilders.
11880	16640	Capital R, Capital B. We don't know what planet the Ringbuilder civilization developed
16640	22320	on, or what their home system is, but we do know that over what is probably a very long
22320	27400	period of time, they became much more technologically advanced than humans.
27400	31820	They mastered spaceflight, they gained an understanding of wormholes, and were able
31820	35600	to utilize those for faster than light travel.
35600	40800	From there they started building a massive network of ring gates, which connected several
40800	46240	systems inside the Milky Way, which all had at least one habitable planet.
46240	48920	This allowed their civilization to thrive.
48920	53660	And in the process of building that network, using the protomolecule for the construction
53660	59060	of the ring gates, they sent what was essentially an icy rock loaded with protomolecule on a
59060	63540	trajectory towards Earth long before advanced life had developed.
63540	68180	This got caught in Saturn's gravity and stayed there for a couple billion years.
68180	73220	It looked like a moon we named it Phoebe, and it just sat there in orbit, full of protomolecule
73220	75100	just waiting to be discovered.
75100	79860	The fact that it got captured may have been necessary for human life to develop in this
79860	80860	scenario.
80860	85460	And while it was stuck there, the ring builder civilization that sent it were completely
85460	86700	wiped out.
86700	91400	Somehow they got themselves in the sights of an even more advanced civilization, which
91400	94420	we refer to as the Unknown Aggressors.
94420	98500	This may be related to the ring gate network that they created, but we don't know for
98500	102700	sure by the end of the fifth book or the fifth season of the television show.
102700	107540	We just know that something set the Unknown Aggressors off, and they did end the ring
107540	109180	builder civilization.
109180	114500	So as far as humanity's concerned, the expanse happens in our solar system in the future.
114500	117900	There's no point of divergence or something like that.
117900	122220	Basically the history we know still exists, there's nothing to contradict that, but it
122220	125020	takes place in the 24th century.
125020	129420	So I guess just for context, when I say that Phoebe's been trapped for two billion plus
129420	135700	years, if we think about humans, modern humans first showed up about 200,000 years ago.
135700	140380	So the protomolecule and the ring builder stuff was happening way before we existed.
140380	143740	When we think of the present in the story, pinning down the year has always been a little
143740	144740	bit murky.
144740	147020	They never mentioned dates in the books.
147020	151540	And there's this weird thing where they put the 23rd century in the text crawl in the
151540	155700	first episode of the series, which is weirdly probably not right.
155700	157340	So this is what I'm going to do.
157340	162780	The best theory has always been that the show starts in the year 2350, because that was
162780	166540	the name given to the role playing game this was developed from.
166540	172060	In season five, we do see some dates for the first time on a time lapse in the opening
172060	175300	credits and it ends with 2355.
175300	177900	So that would fit with the 2350.
177900	180540	Time passes a little bit faster in the TV show.
180540	184140	So that would mean that it's been about five years since the series started compared to
184140	186260	something like 10 in the books.
186260	187940	Either way, that's the way I'm going to do it.
187940	191380	So the Canterbury say happens in 2350.
191380	195060	And in that they're just estimations, it's so we can move around and think about how
195060	196740	things relate to each other.
196740	201780	And it's easier than using a before protomolecule after protomolecule scale, because that's
201780	206020	discovered eight years before the series gets started.
206020	211500	Not long after our present, the colonization of Mars gets underway in the expanse universe.
211500	216860	Over the next hundred years or so, the population of Earth continues to swell, ecological and
216860	222060	climate disasters compound, and the damage to the ecosystem of Earth starts to reach
222060	223860	critical levels.
223860	228580	This leads to a shift in the development of space travel technologies, and this is probably
228580	231980	when development on Luna really started to take off.
231980	236940	During this period, the United Nations becomes Earth's unified government.
236940	242900	After a few generations of being a UN colony, the people on Mars, who were largely self-sufficient
242900	246260	by that time, started to push for independence.
246260	250540	There are actually tensions here, and there was a real chance for war.
250540	255260	It's kind of similar to the events of the American Revolution, the American colonies
255260	256420	in Great Britain.
256420	261980	And there may have been actual fighting if it weren't for a man named Solomon Epstein.
261980	267860	Sometime around 2213, he makes a breakthrough and develops what will become to be known
267860	269780	as the Epstein Drive.
269780	274940	It's a modified fusion drive, and it makes it possible for humanity to start to colonize
274940	276380	the solar system.
276380	281660	As you can imagine, this was really valuable technology, and Mars decides to exchange the
281660	286860	Epstein Drive, share it with the UN, in exchange for independence.
286860	290820	From there, the Martian Congressional Republic is formed.
290820	296340	In the next few generations, the UN and Mars start to spread out into the solar system.
296340	301620	They go to the asteroid belt, they start to extract resources, and over the years colonization
301620	303540	continues to expand.
303540	308260	Differences like Ganymede show up at this time to become an agricultural center for
308260	313580	the outer planets, and in those generations we start to see differences appear in the
313580	317540	bodies of people who are developing in low gravity.
317540	321300	This is where we get the differences between Inners and Belters.
321300	325540	There starts to be a slight difference between Earthers and people who grew up on Mars as
325540	326540	well.
326540	331140	It's in this period where the division lines between the three factions in our story become
331140	332580	clearly defined.
332620	337740	Earth is the birthplace of humanity, it's the homeworld, it's the superpower in the
337740	338740	system.
338740	343500	They've got a lot of problems on the planet itself, but they still have incredible power.
343500	347820	Mars has embarked on a generations-long terraforming project.
347820	351220	But something like that is just so far down the road.
351220	356540	To counteract some of that power that Earth has in their superpower status, Mars has set
356540	359140	out to build a powerful navy of their own.
359140	363820	And of course some advanced military tech and some badass marines to go with it.
363820	368740	And out in the belt, a lot of the people who went out there to try to strike it rich are
368740	372740	finding themselves as an exploitable class of labor.
372740	377580	The fact that these anatomical differences start to happen, when you can visibly see
377580	382140	a difference in someone who grew up in the outer planets, that makes it even easier for
382140	383740	them to be otherized.
383740	388100	They might be people, but they're not Earthers, or even Martians for that matter.
388100	391180	So a life in the belt is one that's defined by oppression.
391180	397220	This leads to the creation of the outer planets alliance at around the turn of the 24th century.
397220	401660	At around 2330, Timmy becomes Amos and leaves Earth.
401660	407020	Around that same time, Philip Inaros is born, and not long after that, the Augustine Gamara
407020	412700	is destroyed by Marco and his fledgling faction of Radical OPA.
412700	417020	At this time, Alex would be doing his 20 years that he did in the navy.
417140	421860	Christian Avicerala would be moving her way up the ranks through the UN government.
421860	427300	And in the late 2330s, James Holden will join the UN's navy and leave Earth.
427300	434460	In 2339, UN Marine Colonel Fred Johnson led a raid on Anderson Station to retake it from
434460	435460	striking workers.
435460	440620	A lot of people died, including civilians who lived there, and he became infamous earning
440620	443600	the title the Butcher of Anderson Station.
443600	448520	After learning that his superior set him up, he resigns, and eventually is recruited into
448520	450960	the OPA by Anderson Dawes.
450960	456640	So in 2342, Mars surveys Phoebe and discovers the protomolecule.
456640	461560	They partner with a corporation called Protogen in order to set up a long term facility to
461560	464760	investigate what this substance that they found is.
464760	469400	A couple years later, James Holden is dishonorably discharged from the navy.
469400	474000	After that, he goes and gets himself a job with the Pure and Clean Water Company, and
474000	480440	about five years later, where the series starts, he's working on an ice hauler called the Canterbury.
480440	484280	Before we get into the timeline of events of the main story, I just want to say that
484280	487760	of course they play out a little bit differently between the books and the show.
487760	491280	In this video, I'm going to lean more towards the show because that's what people are more
491280	495640	familiar with, but with the caveat that while the details are different, they both end up
495640	497800	in the same place overall.
497800	502360	So at the beginning of the story, the future crew of the Rossinante are all working on
502360	503440	the Canterbury.
503440	508360	At the same time, Julie Mao boards a ship called the Scopulae, and they go looking for
508360	513520	a ship called the Anubis because she believes a weapon her father is working on is on that
513520	514520	ship.
514520	517920	She thinks if they can get a hold of that, they can make sure that this weapon is never
517920	519760	used against the Belters.
519760	523440	When they find the Anubis, they're surprised to learn that it's a stealth ship which they
523440	527960	have no chance against, and the Scopulae basically has to surrender.
527960	532120	Julie's taken prisoner, and she's put in a room while the crew of the Anubis tries
532120	534360	to figure out what to do with her.
534360	538560	Protogen then uses the Scopulae to send out a fake distress signal, which the Canterbury
538560	539800	responds to.
539800	545720	Holden, Naomi, Alex, Amos, and Shed take a shuttle called the Knight to investigate.
545720	549720	While they're doing that, the Anubis arrives and destroys the Canterbury.
549720	554440	Holden's doing this in a plan to increase tensions between Earth and Mars so that they
554440	559520	can continue to do their protomolecule research without any interruption.
559520	564480	Because of the Anubis' stealth tech and the distress call coming from a Martian-made beacon,
564480	569800	everyone on the Knight begins to believe that Mars may be behind the attack on the Canter.
569800	575560	When the MCRN Donager responds to the Knight's distress call, Holden sends out a message
575560	579560	saying that there was Martian naval tech planted on the Scopulae.
579560	582760	So he inadvertently plays into Protogen's plan.
582760	586080	The survivors on the Knight are picked up by the Martian vessel.
586080	589920	It's attacked by more stealth ships, but they're able to escape on a frigate that's
589920	592640	docked inside that's named the Tachi.
592640	596000	The Martian Marine who helped them escape dies shortly after.
596000	599800	And so now Holden, Naomi, Alex, and Amos have their own ship.
599800	604720	Fred Johnson from the OPA reaches out to them and tells them that they can come to Tycho's
604720	605720	station.
605720	610400	In the process, the Tachi becomes the Rossinante.
610400	613280	Timeline-wise, Season 1 happens pretty fast.
613280	618160	Space travel does take time, but in Julie's flashback episode, we learn that the Scopulae
618160	624240	encountered the Anubis seven weeks prior to the Rossi crew and Detective Miller discovering
624240	625840	her on Eros.
625840	630600	After her bodies discovered, Protogen moves forward with their plan to conduct an experiment
630600	633720	with the protomolecule on a large population.
633720	639240	They intentionally contaminated the citizens of Eros and exposed them to radiation to speed
639240	641000	up the effects.
641000	645560	Season 1 of the show ends with them setting up the experiment where they can observe what
645560	649680	will happen when the protomolecule has that much biomass to work with.
649680	654400	There's no time jump in between seasons because Season 1 doesn't complete the first book.
654400	658720	I'm glossing over the political and military tensions and engagements between the three
658720	662400	factions because they're somewhat different books to show.
662400	667000	But we do see Phoebe Station destroyed by Mars in the beginning of Season 2.
667000	671680	In the big picture, things are working out for Protogen and Jules Pierre-Mau.
671680	676920	Up until the crew of the Rossi, Detective Miller and Fred Johnson launch a raid on Toss
676920	677920	Station.
677920	681760	This is where Anthony Dresden was coordinating the Eros experiment.
681760	685640	And after the raid is completed, Miller executes Dresden.
685640	690480	From there, they make a plan to push Eros into the sun, using the Mormon colony ship
690480	692560	the Navu as a battering ramp.
692560	697640	They also plan to rig Eros with explosives, and in the process of that, Miller gets stuck
697640	698640	there.
698640	703880	Just before the Navu crashes into Eros, it's able to move out of the way, and then it starts
703880	705740	accelerating towards Earth.
705740	710000	This leads to the UN firing off a bunch of missiles in its direction.
710000	714160	But on Eros, Miller goes looking for Julie, because he's been hearing her voices in the
714160	717440	sounds of the protomolecule in the station.
717440	722400	He's able to find what is basically her consciousness in a body made out of protomolecule.
722400	727920	And he's able to communicate, convincing her to guide Eros into Venus instead of Earth.
727920	733680	The station crashes to the surface of the planet, and this is where Josephus Miller dies.
733680	738660	This is the end of the first book, but it happens in the middle of Season 2 of the show.
738660	743320	And this is where the timeline of the show starts to get condensed and they diverge.
743320	748520	In the first chapter of the second book, it says it's been 18 months since Eros.
748520	753600	In the show it seems somewhat seamless, as there isn't an indication of a lot of time
753600	754600	passing.
754600	756000	The same things happen though.
756000	760840	Kids start to go missing, Project Caliban is going on, they're testing protomolecule
760840	766840	human hybrids, and eventually one of those is released, leading to the conflict at Ganymede.
766840	772800	There one of the hybrids engages with UN and MCR forces on the ground, and that leads to
772800	778680	engagement in space, where the orbital mirrors that focus light on the planet are damaged
778680	783740	and start to fall to the surface, compromising the agricultural domes.
783740	788700	This leads to an armistice summit on Earth, Bobby becomes disillusioned with Mars in relation
788700	794240	to the handling of her reports about the hybrid, and ends up working with Avacerala.
794240	798960	They meet with Jules Pierre Mow on his yacht, and eventually escape on the razorback.
798960	803720	This eventually brings them in contact directly with the Rossinante crew, and that's when
803720	805840	they all meet for the first time.
805840	810880	On Venus, the science vessel the Arbrogast is deconstructed and absorbed into what the
810880	813440	protomolecule is building there.
813440	818360	Hostilities break out around Io, where work on the protomolecule hybrids is continuing.
818360	823040	This will turn out to be the last stand of Jules Pierre Mow and the people who are loyal
823040	824040	to him.
824040	828400	There's an attempt to launch protomolecule hybrids at Mars, which is stopped, and Jules
828400	831220	Pierre Mow is taken into custody.
831220	836600	After that, the protomolecule project on Venus emerges from the planet and launches itself
836600	838920	towards the outer planets.
838920	843240	Just beyond Uranus, it becomes a ring gate, and this event brings the inner planets back
843240	847920	together as all efforts are focused on trying to understand what it is.
847920	850880	This is the transition between the second and third books.
850880	854200	Again, the condensing of the timeline is a little vague here.
854200	859280	Sometimes should have passed while it was traveling from Venus to Uranus, and then also
859280	863680	for the next event which is the EK slingshotting into the ring.
863680	868320	In the show we see that it takes the fleet going to investigate the rings more than six
868320	871240	months after it appeared to get there.
871240	875680	When they do, the ring is opened after the EK has flown into it.
875680	880960	Clarissa Mow sets her plan in motion to set up Holden by blowing up the Sung Yun.
880960	886360	The Rosinante becomes the first ship to enter the ring and survive as they're being chased
886360	891120	down by a torpedo from the behemoth, and then all the ships outside the ring gate follow
891120	893920	after entering the ring space.
893920	899120	Ever since the ring assembled, Holden has been seeing visions of the investigator, what
899120	900960	looks like Detective Miller.
900960	907560	He convinces him to go to the ring station and go inside to help him access the records.
907560	912120	While he's there, they both learn about what happened to the ring builder civilization,
912120	916200	how they were wiped out in an instant by the unknown aggressors.
916200	920560	While they were going to the center of the station, they were being pursued by Martian
920560	925440	Marines, and through acting like a threat, they caused the speed limit outside to be
925440	927140	slowed down again.
927140	932240	This set up a situation where all the ships need to power down so they no longer appear
932240	937200	as a threat to the security system on the station, and after they do that the investigator
937200	942240	is able to turn off the system, eliminating the speed limit in the slow zone.
942240	947960	This is the end of the third book and the third season, and the Rosinante agrees to transport
947960	952720	Clarissa Mow back to Luna so she can be arrested for her crimes.
952720	958000	This is a months long journey, and this is where Amos and Clarissa form their friendship.
958000	963640	Moving into season four, this is the first time we see a one to one adaptation, as season
963640	966520	four just covers the fourth book more or less.
966520	970840	And the book's a lot of time passes because these are long journeys, but the show again
970840	972760	seems to condense things a little.
972760	977360	The time they spend on Illas isn't very long, most of the time that goes by would have happened
977360	979600	on their trip there and the way back.
979600	984280	What happens is a group of refugees from Ganymede run the blockade on the rings and
984280	987480	make it to the surface of a planet which they call Illas.
987480	992360	Avasarala is trying to stop a mad rush through the ring gates because that will essentially
992360	994240	destabilize Mars.
994280	1000160	So she sends the Rosinante to act as a mediator between the belters that already are there
1000160	1005200	and an earth corporation that has a charter to extract lithium from the planet.
1005200	1010320	Secretly she hopes that things will fall apart, Holden being there won't help anything, and
1010320	1014800	he'll actually broadcast how precarious things are whenever you try to rush out to one of
1014800	1017240	these worlds, but that doesn't work out.
1017240	1021800	Back when the hybrid was on the Rossi, it left behind some active protomolecule, and
1021800	1026720	that's what was acting as a note on the network, making it possible for the investigator to
1026720	1028160	appear to Holden.
1028160	1033200	So when the Rossi went to Illas, the investigator was able to activate all the protomolecule
1033200	1034640	tech on the planet.
1034640	1040720	In the process of that, he realized that there was a magic bullet left behind from the unknown
1040720	1045040	aggressors, and that was a weapon they used against the Ring Builder civilization.
1045040	1050840	He's able to use that to deactivate everything he turned on and avert crisis for everyone
1050840	1052360	on the planet.
1052360	1057120	Before he does that, he tells Holden to destroy the active protomolecule on the Rossi to make
1057120	1059960	sure something like that doesn't happen in the future.
1059960	1064000	So on Illas, things did get pretty bad, but almost everyone survived.
1064000	1068720	This is the opposite of what Abbasarala was hoping would happen, seeing that the situation
1068720	1073240	was survivable and that the Belters had a ship full of lithium that they'll be bringing
1073240	1078280	back to sell, only increased enthusiasm for people wanting to colonize the planets on
1078280	1080160	the other side of the Ring Gates.
1080160	1084880	By destroying the active protomolecule on the Rossi, this trip marks the end of Holden's
1084880	1087240	connection to the Blue Goo.
1087240	1092280	So from there, we get into Season 5 and the Fifth Book, and the Rossi returns the Sol
1092280	1097680	System where the ship will have to be repaired, and that's going to take about six months.
1097680	1102560	The crew splits up at this time, and so if we look at the timeline, you could make it
1102560	1107920	work that this is 2355, like it showed on the opening screen.
1107920	1112360	At the end of Season 4, we saw the Free Navy get stealth tech and put the plan to throw
1112360	1117720	rocks at Earth in motion, but we don't know when that happened in relation to the Rossi's
1117720	1119760	return trip to Sol System.
1119760	1125200	In other words, some time may have passed between when Ashford was spaced and when they launched
1125200	1126200	the rocks.
1126200	1130280	And I mention that because at the beginning of Season 5, we see that it's been nearly
1130280	1132680	six months after the rocks have been launched.
1132680	1137080	From there, the events that happened in Season 5 happened pretty quickly, and the books they
1137080	1143040	say that it takes Amos and Clarissa about 14 days to get from the prison to Baltimore,
1143040	1145260	and everything else happens concurrently.
1145260	1150400	So the rocks hit Earth, Tycho Station is attacked, Fred Johnson is killed, the breakaway
1150400	1154840	Martian Fleet burns towards the Ring, and at the end of the Fifth Season, we have the
1154840	1160440	battle for Soulgate, and the Bar Keith disappearing as it passes through the Laconia Ring.
1160440	1165400	In the show's version of events, we lose our first Rossi crew member, too, when Alex strokes
1165400	1167240	out after a hygiene maneuver.
1167240	1168960	This hasn't happened in the books yet.
1168960	1174360	The actor who portrayed him was fired by the show after more than 40 allegations of abuse
1174360	1179360	and harassment made by fans and co-workers, so they decided to kill him off.
1179360	1181680	Three major things happen in Season 5.
1181680	1187320	The asteroid attack against Earth, the breakaway Martian Fleet taking Fred Johnson's protomolecule
1187320	1192340	sample and passing through the Ring gates to the Laconia System, where they plan to start
1192340	1197260	their own civilization using the protomolecule to help them advance.
1197260	1202140	And the rise of the Free Navy and Soul System, where they took control of Medina Station,
1202140	1206740	which means they now have control of any traffic going through the Rings.
1206740	1211380	By the end of working on this, I can say I understand why the authors chose to keep the
1211380	1213920	timeline vague when they developed the story.
1213920	1218780	There aren't many examples of blatant discrepancies in the timelines of the books.
1218780	1222940	These mostly make sense when you look at it closely, but there is a lot of discussion
1222940	1227380	about whether some of the travel times that show up there are correct or not.
1227380	1230780	And I'm not a math guy, so that's beyond my skill set.
1230780	1234700	One of the first things I noticed when I started looking at the timeline in the past is that
1234700	1238700	most of what happens inside any of the books happens pretty quickly.
1238700	1243580	And then the real time passes in between when they're traveling or if there's just downtime
1243580	1246760	between where one book ends and the next one picks up.
1246760	1251140	Based on the obvious markers, I think the timeline of the books through number 5 is
1251140	1256820	between 8 to 11 years, and the show seems to condense that into a 5 year span.
1256820	1259380	And I think that is a great place to leave things.
1259380	1263780	We can continue the conversation in the comments, so make sure to let me know what you think.
1263780	1265380	What do you think of the timeline?
1265380	1268980	Do you think it should take longer like it did in the books, or do you like how the show
1268980	1270980	condense things down?
