00:00.000 --> 00:06.520
More than two billion years before the protomolecule was discovered in our solar system, it was

00:06.520 --> 00:11.880
created by an advanced civilization we refer to as the Ringbuilders.

00:11.880 --> 00:16.640
Capital R, Capital B. We don't know what planet the Ringbuilder civilization developed

00:16.640 --> 00:22.320
on, or what their home system is, but we do know that over what is probably a very long

00:22.320 --> 00:27.400
period of time, they became much more technologically advanced than humans.

00:27.400 --> 00:31.820
They mastered spaceflight, they gained an understanding of wormholes, and were able

00:31.820 --> 00:35.600
to utilize those for faster than light travel.

00:35.600 --> 00:40.800
From there they started building a massive network of ring gates, which connected several

00:40.800 --> 00:46.240
systems inside the Milky Way, which all had at least one habitable planet.

00:46.240 --> 00:48.920
This allowed their civilization to thrive.

00:48.920 --> 00:53.660
And in the process of building that network, using the protomolecule for the construction

00:53.660 --> 00:59.060
of the ring gates, they sent what was essentially an icy rock loaded with protomolecule on a

00:59.060 --> 01:03.540
trajectory towards Earth long before advanced life had developed.

01:03.540 --> 01:08.180
This got caught in Saturn's gravity and stayed there for a couple billion years.

01:08.180 --> 01:13.220
It looked like a moon we named it Phoebe, and it just sat there in orbit, full of protomolecule

01:13.220 --> 01:15.100
just waiting to be discovered.

01:15.100 --> 01:19.860
The fact that it got captured may have been necessary for human life to develop in this

01:19.860 --> 01:20.860
scenario.

01:20.860 --> 01:25.460
And while it was stuck there, the ring builder civilization that sent it were completely

01:25.460 --> 01:26.700
wiped out.

01:26.700 --> 01:31.400
Somehow they got themselves in the sights of an even more advanced civilization, which

01:31.400 --> 01:34.420
we refer to as the Unknown Aggressors.

01:34.420 --> 01:38.500
This may be related to the ring gate network that they created, but we don't know for

01:38.500 --> 01:42.700
sure by the end of the fifth book or the fifth season of the television show.

01:42.700 --> 01:47.540
We just know that something set the Unknown Aggressors off, and they did end the ring

01:47.540 --> 01:49.180
builder civilization.

01:49.180 --> 01:54.500
So as far as humanity's concerned, the expanse happens in our solar system in the future.

01:54.500 --> 01:57.900
There's no point of divergence or something like that.

01:57.900 --> 02:02.220
Basically the history we know still exists, there's nothing to contradict that, but it

02:02.220 --> 02:05.020
takes place in the 24th century.

02:05.020 --> 02:09.420
So I guess just for context, when I say that Phoebe's been trapped for two billion plus

02:09.420 --> 02:15.700
years, if we think about humans, modern humans first showed up about 200,000 years ago.

02:15.700 --> 02:20.380
So the protomolecule and the ring builder stuff was happening way before we existed.

02:20.380 --> 02:23.740
When we think of the present in the story, pinning down the year has always been a little

02:23.740 --> 02:24.740
bit murky.

02:24.740 --> 02:27.020
They never mentioned dates in the books.

02:27.020 --> 02:31.540
And there's this weird thing where they put the 23rd century in the text crawl in the

02:31.540 --> 02:35.700
first episode of the series, which is weirdly probably not right.

02:35.700 --> 02:37.340
So this is what I'm going to do.

02:37.340 --> 02:42.780
The best theory has always been that the show starts in the year 2350, because that was

02:42.780 --> 02:46.540
the name given to the role playing game this was developed from.

02:46.540 --> 02:52.060
In season five, we do see some dates for the first time on a time lapse in the opening

02:52.060 --> 02:55.300
credits and it ends with 2355.

02:55.300 --> 02:57.900
So that would fit with the 2350.

02:57.900 --> 03:00.540
Time passes a little bit faster in the TV show.

03:00.540 --> 03:04.140
So that would mean that it's been about five years since the series started compared to

03:04.140 --> 03:06.260
something like 10 in the books.

03:06.260 --> 03:07.940
Either way, that's the way I'm going to do it.

03:07.940 --> 03:11.380
So the Canterbury say happens in 2350.

03:11.380 --> 03:15.060
And in that they're just estimations, it's so we can move around and think about how

03:15.060 --> 03:16.740
things relate to each other.

03:16.740 --> 03:21.780
And it's easier than using a before protomolecule after protomolecule scale, because that's

03:21.780 --> 03:26.020
discovered eight years before the series gets started.

03:26.020 --> 03:31.500
Not long after our present, the colonization of Mars gets underway in the expanse universe.

03:31.500 --> 03:36.860
Over the next hundred years or so, the population of Earth continues to swell, ecological and

03:36.860 --> 03:42.060
climate disasters compound, and the damage to the ecosystem of Earth starts to reach

03:42.060 --> 03:43.860
critical levels.

03:43.860 --> 03:48.580
This leads to a shift in the development of space travel technologies, and this is probably

03:48.580 --> 03:51.980
when development on Luna really started to take off.

03:51.980 --> 03:56.940
During this period, the United Nations becomes Earth's unified government.

03:56.940 --> 04:02.900
After a few generations of being a UN colony, the people on Mars, who were largely self-sufficient

04:02.900 --> 04:06.260
by that time, started to push for independence.

04:06.260 --> 04:10.540
There are actually tensions here, and there was a real chance for war.

04:10.540 --> 04:15.260
It's kind of similar to the events of the American Revolution, the American colonies

04:15.260 --> 04:16.420
in Great Britain.

04:16.420 --> 04:21.980
And there may have been actual fighting if it weren't for a man named Solomon Epstein.

04:21.980 --> 04:27.860
Sometime around 2213, he makes a breakthrough and develops what will become to be known

04:27.860 --> 04:29.780
as the Epstein Drive.

04:29.780 --> 04:34.940
It's a modified fusion drive, and it makes it possible for humanity to start to colonize

04:34.940 --> 04:36.380
the solar system.

04:36.380 --> 04:41.660
As you can imagine, this was really valuable technology, and Mars decides to exchange the

04:41.660 --> 04:46.860
Epstein Drive, share it with the UN, in exchange for independence.

04:46.860 --> 04:50.820
From there, the Martian Congressional Republic is formed.

04:50.820 --> 04:56.340
In the next few generations, the UN and Mars start to spread out into the solar system.

04:56.340 --> 05:01.620
They go to the asteroid belt, they start to extract resources, and over the years colonization

05:01.620 --> 05:03.540
continues to expand.

05:03.540 --> 05:08.260
Differences like Ganymede show up at this time to become an agricultural center for

05:08.260 --> 05:13.580
the outer planets, and in those generations we start to see differences appear in the

05:13.580 --> 05:17.540
bodies of people who are developing in low gravity.

05:17.540 --> 05:21.300
This is where we get the differences between Inners and Belters.

05:21.300 --> 05:25.540
There starts to be a slight difference between Earthers and people who grew up on Mars as

05:25.540 --> 05:26.540
well.

05:26.540 --> 05:31.140
It's in this period where the division lines between the three factions in our story become

05:31.140 --> 05:32.580
clearly defined.

05:32.620 --> 05:37.740
Earth is the birthplace of humanity, it's the homeworld, it's the superpower in the

05:37.740 --> 05:38.740
system.

05:38.740 --> 05:43.500
They've got a lot of problems on the planet itself, but they still have incredible power.

05:43.500 --> 05:47.820
Mars has embarked on a generations-long terraforming project.

05:47.820 --> 05:51.220
But something like that is just so far down the road.

05:51.220 --> 05:56.540
To counteract some of that power that Earth has in their superpower status, Mars has set

05:56.540 --> 05:59.140
out to build a powerful navy of their own.

05:59.140 --> 06:03.820
And of course some advanced military tech and some badass marines to go with it.

06:03.820 --> 06:08.740
And out in the belt, a lot of the people who went out there to try to strike it rich are

06:08.740 --> 06:12.740
finding themselves as an exploitable class of labor.

06:12.740 --> 06:17.580
The fact that these anatomical differences start to happen, when you can visibly see

06:17.580 --> 06:22.140
a difference in someone who grew up in the outer planets, that makes it even easier for

06:22.140 --> 06:23.740
them to be otherized.

06:23.740 --> 06:28.100
They might be people, but they're not Earthers, or even Martians for that matter.

06:28.100 --> 06:31.180
So a life in the belt is one that's defined by oppression.

06:31.180 --> 06:37.220
This leads to the creation of the outer planets alliance at around the turn of the 24th century.

06:37.220 --> 06:41.660
At around 2330, Timmy becomes Amos and leaves Earth.

06:41.660 --> 06:47.020
Around that same time, Philip Inaros is born, and not long after that, the Augustine Gamara

06:47.020 --> 06:52.700
is destroyed by Marco and his fledgling faction of Radical OPA.

06:52.700 --> 06:57.020
At this time, Alex would be doing his 20 years that he did in the navy.

06:57.140 --> 07:01.860
Christian Avicerala would be moving her way up the ranks through the UN government.

07:01.860 --> 07:07.300
And in the late 2330s, James Holden will join the UN's navy and leave Earth.

07:07.300 --> 07:14.460
In 2339, UN Marine Colonel Fred Johnson led a raid on Anderson Station to retake it from

07:14.460 --> 07:15.460
striking workers.

07:15.460 --> 07:20.620
A lot of people died, including civilians who lived there, and he became infamous earning

07:20.620 --> 07:23.600
the title the Butcher of Anderson Station.

07:23.600 --> 07:28.520
After learning that his superior set him up, he resigns, and eventually is recruited into

07:28.520 --> 07:30.960
the OPA by Anderson Dawes.

07:30.960 --> 07:36.640
So in 2342, Mars surveys Phoebe and discovers the protomolecule.

07:36.640 --> 07:41.560
They partner with a corporation called Protogen in order to set up a long term facility to

07:41.560 --> 07:44.760
investigate what this substance that they found is.

07:44.760 --> 07:49.400
A couple years later, James Holden is dishonorably discharged from the navy.

07:49.400 --> 07:54.000
After that, he goes and gets himself a job with the Pure and Clean Water Company, and

07:54.000 --> 08:00.440
about five years later, where the series starts, he's working on an ice hauler called the Canterbury.

08:00.440 --> 08:04.280
Before we get into the timeline of events of the main story, I just want to say that

08:04.280 --> 08:07.760
of course they play out a little bit differently between the books and the show.

08:07.760 --> 08:11.280
In this video, I'm going to lean more towards the show because that's what people are more

08:11.280 --> 08:15.640
familiar with, but with the caveat that while the details are different, they both end up

08:15.640 --> 08:17.800
in the same place overall.

08:17.800 --> 08:22.360
So at the beginning of the story, the future crew of the Rossinante are all working on

08:22.360 --> 08:23.440
the Canterbury.

08:23.440 --> 08:28.360
At the same time, Julie Mao boards a ship called the Scopulae, and they go looking for

08:28.360 --> 08:33.520
a ship called the Anubis because she believes a weapon her father is working on is on that

08:33.520 --> 08:34.520
ship.

08:34.520 --> 08:37.920
She thinks if they can get a hold of that, they can make sure that this weapon is never

08:37.920 --> 08:39.760
used against the Belters.

08:39.760 --> 08:43.440
When they find the Anubis, they're surprised to learn that it's a stealth ship which they

08:43.440 --> 08:47.960
have no chance against, and the Scopulae basically has to surrender.

08:47.960 --> 08:52.120
Julie's taken prisoner, and she's put in a room while the crew of the Anubis tries

08:52.120 --> 08:54.360
to figure out what to do with her.

08:54.360 --> 08:58.560
Protogen then uses the Scopulae to send out a fake distress signal, which the Canterbury

08:58.560 --> 08:59.800
responds to.

08:59.800 --> 09:05.720
Holden, Naomi, Alex, Amos, and Shed take a shuttle called the Knight to investigate.

09:05.720 --> 09:09.720
While they're doing that, the Anubis arrives and destroys the Canterbury.

09:09.720 --> 09:14.440
Holden's doing this in a plan to increase tensions between Earth and Mars so that they

09:14.440 --> 09:19.520
can continue to do their protomolecule research without any interruption.

09:19.520 --> 09:24.480
Because of the Anubis' stealth tech and the distress call coming from a Martian-made beacon,

09:24.480 --> 09:29.800
everyone on the Knight begins to believe that Mars may be behind the attack on the Canter.

09:29.800 --> 09:35.560
When the MCRN Donager responds to the Knight's distress call, Holden sends out a message

09:35.560 --> 09:39.560
saying that there was Martian naval tech planted on the Scopulae.

09:39.560 --> 09:42.760
So he inadvertently plays into Protogen's plan.

09:42.760 --> 09:46.080
The survivors on the Knight are picked up by the Martian vessel.

09:46.080 --> 09:49.920
It's attacked by more stealth ships, but they're able to escape on a frigate that's

09:49.920 --> 09:52.640
docked inside that's named the Tachi.

09:52.640 --> 09:56.000
The Martian Marine who helped them escape dies shortly after.

09:56.000 --> 09:59.800
And so now Holden, Naomi, Alex, and Amos have their own ship.

09:59.800 --> 10:04.720
Fred Johnson from the OPA reaches out to them and tells them that they can come to Tycho's

10:04.720 --> 10:05.720
station.

10:05.720 --> 10:10.400
In the process, the Tachi becomes the Rossinante.

10:10.400 --> 10:13.280
Timeline-wise, Season 1 happens pretty fast.

10:13.280 --> 10:18.160
Space travel does take time, but in Julie's flashback episode, we learn that the Scopulae

10:18.160 --> 10:24.240
encountered the Anubis seven weeks prior to the Rossi crew and Detective Miller discovering

10:24.240 --> 10:25.840
her on Eros.

10:25.840 --> 10:30.600
After her bodies discovered, Protogen moves forward with their plan to conduct an experiment

10:30.600 --> 10:33.720
with the protomolecule on a large population.

10:33.720 --> 10:39.240
They intentionally contaminated the citizens of Eros and exposed them to radiation to speed

10:39.240 --> 10:41.000
up the effects.

10:41.000 --> 10:45.560
Season 1 of the show ends with them setting up the experiment where they can observe what

10:45.560 --> 10:49.680
will happen when the protomolecule has that much biomass to work with.

10:49.680 --> 10:54.400
There's no time jump in between seasons because Season 1 doesn't complete the first book.

10:54.400 --> 10:58.720
I'm glossing over the political and military tensions and engagements between the three

10:58.720 --> 11:02.400
factions because they're somewhat different books to show.

11:02.400 --> 11:07.000
But we do see Phoebe Station destroyed by Mars in the beginning of Season 2.

11:07.000 --> 11:11.680
In the big picture, things are working out for Protogen and Jules Pierre-Mau.

11:11.680 --> 11:16.920
Up until the crew of the Rossi, Detective Miller and Fred Johnson launch a raid on Toss

11:16.920 --> 11:17.920
Station.

11:17.920 --> 11:21.760
This is where Anthony Dresden was coordinating the Eros experiment.

11:21.760 --> 11:25.640
And after the raid is completed, Miller executes Dresden.

11:25.640 --> 11:30.480
From there, they make a plan to push Eros into the sun, using the Mormon colony ship

11:30.480 --> 11:32.560
the Navu as a battering ramp.

11:32.560 --> 11:37.640
They also plan to rig Eros with explosives, and in the process of that, Miller gets stuck

11:37.640 --> 11:38.640
there.

11:38.640 --> 11:43.880
Just before the Navu crashes into Eros, it's able to move out of the way, and then it starts

11:43.880 --> 11:45.740
accelerating towards Earth.

11:45.740 --> 11:50.000
This leads to the UN firing off a bunch of missiles in its direction.

11:50.000 --> 11:54.160
But on Eros, Miller goes looking for Julie, because he's been hearing her voices in the

11:54.160 --> 11:57.440
sounds of the protomolecule in the station.

11:57.440 --> 12:02.400
He's able to find what is basically her consciousness in a body made out of protomolecule.

12:02.400 --> 12:07.920
And he's able to communicate, convincing her to guide Eros into Venus instead of Earth.

12:07.920 --> 12:13.680
The station crashes to the surface of the planet, and this is where Josephus Miller dies.

12:13.680 --> 12:18.660
This is the end of the first book, but it happens in the middle of Season 2 of the show.

12:18.660 --> 12:23.320
And this is where the timeline of the show starts to get condensed and they diverge.

12:23.320 --> 12:28.520
In the first chapter of the second book, it says it's been 18 months since Eros.

12:28.520 --> 12:33.600
In the show it seems somewhat seamless, as there isn't an indication of a lot of time

12:33.600 --> 12:34.600
passing.

12:34.600 --> 12:36.000
The same things happen though.

12:36.000 --> 12:40.840
Kids start to go missing, Project Caliban is going on, they're testing protomolecule

12:40.840 --> 12:46.840
human hybrids, and eventually one of those is released, leading to the conflict at Ganymede.

12:46.840 --> 12:52.800
There one of the hybrids engages with UN and MCR forces on the ground, and that leads to

12:52.800 --> 12:58.680
engagement in space, where the orbital mirrors that focus light on the planet are damaged

12:58.680 --> 13:03.740
and start to fall to the surface, compromising the agricultural domes.

13:03.740 --> 13:08.700
This leads to an armistice summit on Earth, Bobby becomes disillusioned with Mars in relation

13:08.700 --> 13:14.240
to the handling of her reports about the hybrid, and ends up working with Avacerala.

13:14.240 --> 13:18.960
They meet with Jules Pierre Mow on his yacht, and eventually escape on the razorback.

13:18.960 --> 13:23.720
This eventually brings them in contact directly with the Rossinante crew, and that's when

13:23.720 --> 13:25.840
they all meet for the first time.

13:25.840 --> 13:30.880
On Venus, the science vessel the Arbrogast is deconstructed and absorbed into what the

13:30.880 --> 13:33.440
protomolecule is building there.

13:33.440 --> 13:38.360
Hostilities break out around Io, where work on the protomolecule hybrids is continuing.

13:38.360 --> 13:43.040
This will turn out to be the last stand of Jules Pierre Mow and the people who are loyal

13:43.040 --> 13:44.040
to him.

13:44.040 --> 13:48.400
There's an attempt to launch protomolecule hybrids at Mars, which is stopped, and Jules

13:48.400 --> 13:51.220
Pierre Mow is taken into custody.

13:51.220 --> 13:56.600
After that, the protomolecule project on Venus emerges from the planet and launches itself

13:56.600 --> 13:58.920
towards the outer planets.

13:58.920 --> 14:03.240
Just beyond Uranus, it becomes a ring gate, and this event brings the inner planets back

14:03.240 --> 14:07.920
together as all efforts are focused on trying to understand what it is.

14:07.920 --> 14:10.880
This is the transition between the second and third books.

14:10.880 --> 14:14.200
Again, the condensing of the timeline is a little vague here.

14:14.200 --> 14:19.280
Sometimes should have passed while it was traveling from Venus to Uranus, and then also

14:19.280 --> 14:23.680
for the next event which is the EK slingshotting into the ring.

14:23.680 --> 14:28.320
In the show we see that it takes the fleet going to investigate the rings more than six

14:28.320 --> 14:31.240
months after it appeared to get there.

14:31.240 --> 14:35.680
When they do, the ring is opened after the EK has flown into it.

14:35.680 --> 14:40.960
Clarissa Mow sets her plan in motion to set up Holden by blowing up the Sung Yun.

14:40.960 --> 14:46.360
The Rosinante becomes the first ship to enter the ring and survive as they're being chased

14:46.360 --> 14:51.120
down by a torpedo from the behemoth, and then all the ships outside the ring gate follow

14:51.120 --> 14:53.920
after entering the ring space.

14:53.920 --> 14:59.120
Ever since the ring assembled, Holden has been seeing visions of the investigator, what

14:59.120 --> 15:00.960
looks like Detective Miller.

15:00.960 --> 15:07.560
He convinces him to go to the ring station and go inside to help him access the records.

15:07.560 --> 15:12.120
While he's there, they both learn about what happened to the ring builder civilization,

15:12.120 --> 15:16.200
how they were wiped out in an instant by the unknown aggressors.

15:16.200 --> 15:20.560
While they were going to the center of the station, they were being pursued by Martian

15:20.560 --> 15:25.440
Marines, and through acting like a threat, they caused the speed limit outside to be

15:25.440 --> 15:27.140
slowed down again.

15:27.140 --> 15:32.240
This set up a situation where all the ships need to power down so they no longer appear

15:32.240 --> 15:37.200
as a threat to the security system on the station, and after they do that the investigator

15:37.200 --> 15:42.240
is able to turn off the system, eliminating the speed limit in the slow zone.

15:42.240 --> 15:47.960
This is the end of the third book and the third season, and the Rosinante agrees to transport

15:47.960 --> 15:52.720
Clarissa Mow back to Luna so she can be arrested for her crimes.

15:52.720 --> 15:58.000
This is a months long journey, and this is where Amos and Clarissa form their friendship.

15:58.000 --> 16:03.640
Moving into season four, this is the first time we see a one to one adaptation, as season

16:03.640 --> 16:06.520
four just covers the fourth book more or less.

16:06.520 --> 16:10.840
And the book's a lot of time passes because these are long journeys, but the show again

16:10.840 --> 16:12.760
seems to condense things a little.

16:12.760 --> 16:17.360
The time they spend on Illas isn't very long, most of the time that goes by would have happened

16:17.360 --> 16:19.600
on their trip there and the way back.

16:19.600 --> 16:24.280
What happens is a group of refugees from Ganymede run the blockade on the rings and

16:24.280 --> 16:27.480
make it to the surface of a planet which they call Illas.

16:27.480 --> 16:32.360
Avasarala is trying to stop a mad rush through the ring gates because that will essentially

16:32.360 --> 16:34.240
destabilize Mars.

16:34.280 --> 16:40.160
So she sends the Rosinante to act as a mediator between the belters that already are there

16:40.160 --> 16:45.200
and an earth corporation that has a charter to extract lithium from the planet.

16:45.200 --> 16:50.320
Secretly she hopes that things will fall apart, Holden being there won't help anything, and

16:50.320 --> 16:54.800
he'll actually broadcast how precarious things are whenever you try to rush out to one of

16:54.800 --> 16:57.240
these worlds, but that doesn't work out.

16:57.240 --> 17:01.800
Back when the hybrid was on the Rossi, it left behind some active protomolecule, and

17:01.800 --> 17:06.720
that's what was acting as a note on the network, making it possible for the investigator to

17:06.720 --> 17:08.160
appear to Holden.

17:08.160 --> 17:13.200
So when the Rossi went to Illas, the investigator was able to activate all the protomolecule

17:13.200 --> 17:14.640
tech on the planet.

17:14.640 --> 17:20.720
In the process of that, he realized that there was a magic bullet left behind from the unknown

17:20.720 --> 17:25.040
aggressors, and that was a weapon they used against the Ring Builder civilization.

17:25.040 --> 17:30.840
He's able to use that to deactivate everything he turned on and avert crisis for everyone

17:30.840 --> 17:32.360
on the planet.

17:32.360 --> 17:37.120
Before he does that, he tells Holden to destroy the active protomolecule on the Rossi to make

17:37.120 --> 17:39.960
sure something like that doesn't happen in the future.

17:39.960 --> 17:44.000
So on Illas, things did get pretty bad, but almost everyone survived.

17:44.000 --> 17:48.720
This is the opposite of what Abbasarala was hoping would happen, seeing that the situation

17:48.720 --> 17:53.240
was survivable and that the Belters had a ship full of lithium that they'll be bringing

17:53.240 --> 17:58.280
back to sell, only increased enthusiasm for people wanting to colonize the planets on

17:58.280 --> 18:00.160
the other side of the Ring Gates.

18:00.160 --> 18:04.880
By destroying the active protomolecule on the Rossi, this trip marks the end of Holden's

18:04.880 --> 18:07.240
connection to the Blue Goo.

18:07.240 --> 18:12.280
So from there, we get into Season 5 and the Fifth Book, and the Rossi returns the Sol

18:12.280 --> 18:17.680
System where the ship will have to be repaired, and that's going to take about six months.

18:17.680 --> 18:22.560
The crew splits up at this time, and so if we look at the timeline, you could make it

18:22.560 --> 18:27.920
work that this is 2355, like it showed on the opening screen.

18:27.920 --> 18:32.360
At the end of Season 4, we saw the Free Navy get stealth tech and put the plan to throw

18:32.360 --> 18:37.720
rocks at Earth in motion, but we don't know when that happened in relation to the Rossi's

18:37.720 --> 18:39.760
return trip to Sol System.

18:39.760 --> 18:45.200
In other words, some time may have passed between when Ashford was spaced and when they launched

18:45.200 --> 18:46.200
the rocks.

18:46.200 --> 18:50.280
And I mention that because at the beginning of Season 5, we see that it's been nearly

18:50.280 --> 18:52.680
six months after the rocks have been launched.

18:52.680 --> 18:57.080
From there, the events that happened in Season 5 happened pretty quickly, and the books they

18:57.080 --> 19:03.040
say that it takes Amos and Clarissa about 14 days to get from the prison to Baltimore,

19:03.040 --> 19:05.260
and everything else happens concurrently.

19:05.260 --> 19:10.400
So the rocks hit Earth, Tycho Station is attacked, Fred Johnson is killed, the breakaway

19:10.400 --> 19:14.840
Martian Fleet burns towards the Ring, and at the end of the Fifth Season, we have the

19:14.840 --> 19:20.440
battle for Soulgate, and the Bar Keith disappearing as it passes through the Laconia Ring.

19:20.440 --> 19:25.400
In the show's version of events, we lose our first Rossi crew member, too, when Alex strokes

19:25.400 --> 19:27.240
out after a hygiene maneuver.

19:27.240 --> 19:28.960
This hasn't happened in the books yet.

19:28.960 --> 19:34.360
The actor who portrayed him was fired by the show after more than 40 allegations of abuse

19:34.360 --> 19:39.360
and harassment made by fans and co-workers, so they decided to kill him off.

19:39.360 --> 19:41.680
Three major things happen in Season 5.

19:41.680 --> 19:47.320
The asteroid attack against Earth, the breakaway Martian Fleet taking Fred Johnson's protomolecule

19:47.320 --> 19:52.340
sample and passing through the Ring gates to the Laconia System, where they plan to start

19:52.340 --> 19:57.260
their own civilization using the protomolecule to help them advance.

19:57.260 --> 20:02.140
And the rise of the Free Navy and Soul System, where they took control of Medina Station,

20:02.140 --> 20:06.740
which means they now have control of any traffic going through the Rings.

20:06.740 --> 20:11.380
By the end of working on this, I can say I understand why the authors chose to keep the

20:11.380 --> 20:13.920
timeline vague when they developed the story.

20:13.920 --> 20:18.780
There aren't many examples of blatant discrepancies in the timelines of the books.

20:18.780 --> 20:22.940
These mostly make sense when you look at it closely, but there is a lot of discussion

20:22.940 --> 20:27.380
about whether some of the travel times that show up there are correct or not.

20:27.380 --> 20:30.780
And I'm not a math guy, so that's beyond my skill set.

20:30.780 --> 20:34.700
One of the first things I noticed when I started looking at the timeline in the past is that

20:34.700 --> 20:38.700
most of what happens inside any of the books happens pretty quickly.

20:38.700 --> 20:43.580
And then the real time passes in between when they're traveling or if there's just downtime

20:43.580 --> 20:46.760
between where one book ends and the next one picks up.

20:46.760 --> 20:51.140
Based on the obvious markers, I think the timeline of the books through number 5 is

20:51.140 --> 20:56.820
between 8 to 11 years, and the show seems to condense that into a 5 year span.

20:56.820 --> 20:59.380
And I think that is a great place to leave things.

20:59.380 --> 21:03.780
We can continue the conversation in the comments, so make sure to let me know what you think.

21:03.780 --> 21:05.380
What do you think of the timeline?

21:05.380 --> 21:08.980
Do you think it should take longer like it did in the books, or do you like how the show

21:08.980 --> 21:10.980
condense things down?

21:10.980 --> 21:13.060
Please like this video if you enjoyed it.
