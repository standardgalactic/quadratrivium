1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,520
More than two billion years before the protomolecule was discovered in our solar system, it was

2
00:00:06,520 --> 00:00:11,880
created by an advanced civilization we refer to as the Ringbuilders.

3
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:16,640
Capital R, Capital B. We don't know what planet the Ringbuilder civilization developed

4
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:22,320
on, or what their home system is, but we do know that over what is probably a very long

5
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:27,400
period of time, they became much more technologically advanced than humans.

6
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:31,820
They mastered spaceflight, they gained an understanding of wormholes, and were able

7
00:00:31,820 --> 00:00:35,600
to utilize those for faster than light travel.

8
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:40,800
From there they started building a massive network of ring gates, which connected several

9
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:46,240
systems inside the Milky Way, which all had at least one habitable planet.

10
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:48,920
This allowed their civilization to thrive.

11
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:53,660
And in the process of building that network, using the protomolecule for the construction

12
00:00:53,660 --> 00:00:59,060
of the ring gates, they sent what was essentially an icy rock loaded with protomolecule on a

13
00:00:59,060 --> 00:01:03,540
trajectory towards Earth long before advanced life had developed.

14
00:01:03,540 --> 00:01:08,180
This got caught in Saturn's gravity and stayed there for a couple billion years.

15
00:01:08,180 --> 00:01:13,220
It looked like a moon we named it Phoebe, and it just sat there in orbit, full of protomolecule

16
00:01:13,220 --> 00:01:15,100
just waiting to be discovered.

17
00:01:15,100 --> 00:01:19,860
The fact that it got captured may have been necessary for human life to develop in this

18
00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:20,860
scenario.

19
00:01:20,860 --> 00:01:25,460
And while it was stuck there, the ring builder civilization that sent it were completely

20
00:01:25,460 --> 00:01:26,700
wiped out.

21
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:31,400
Somehow they got themselves in the sights of an even more advanced civilization, which

22
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:34,420
we refer to as the Unknown Aggressors.

23
00:01:34,420 --> 00:01:38,500
This may be related to the ring gate network that they created, but we don't know for

24
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:42,700
sure by the end of the fifth book or the fifth season of the television show.

25
00:01:42,700 --> 00:01:47,540
We just know that something set the Unknown Aggressors off, and they did end the ring

26
00:01:47,540 --> 00:01:49,180
builder civilization.

27
00:01:49,180 --> 00:01:54,500
So as far as humanity's concerned, the expanse happens in our solar system in the future.

28
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:57,900
There's no point of divergence or something like that.

29
00:01:57,900 --> 00:02:02,220
Basically the history we know still exists, there's nothing to contradict that, but it

30
00:02:02,220 --> 00:02:05,020
takes place in the 24th century.

31
00:02:05,020 --> 00:02:09,420
So I guess just for context, when I say that Phoebe's been trapped for two billion plus

32
00:02:09,420 --> 00:02:15,700
years, if we think about humans, modern humans first showed up about 200,000 years ago.

33
00:02:15,700 --> 00:02:20,380
So the protomolecule and the ring builder stuff was happening way before we existed.

34
00:02:20,380 --> 00:02:23,740
When we think of the present in the story, pinning down the year has always been a little

35
00:02:23,740 --> 00:02:24,740
bit murky.

36
00:02:24,740 --> 00:02:27,020
They never mentioned dates in the books.

37
00:02:27,020 --> 00:02:31,540
And there's this weird thing where they put the 23rd century in the text crawl in the

38
00:02:31,540 --> 00:02:35,700
first episode of the series, which is weirdly probably not right.

39
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:37,340
So this is what I'm going to do.

40
00:02:37,340 --> 00:02:42,780
The best theory has always been that the show starts in the year 2350, because that was

41
00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:46,540
the name given to the role playing game this was developed from.

42
00:02:46,540 --> 00:02:52,060
In season five, we do see some dates for the first time on a time lapse in the opening

43
00:02:52,060 --> 00:02:55,300
credits and it ends with 2355.

44
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:57,900
So that would fit with the 2350.

45
00:02:57,900 --> 00:03:00,540
Time passes a little bit faster in the TV show.

46
00:03:00,540 --> 00:03:04,140
So that would mean that it's been about five years since the series started compared to

47
00:03:04,140 --> 00:03:06,260
something like 10 in the books.

48
00:03:06,260 --> 00:03:07,940
Either way, that's the way I'm going to do it.

49
00:03:07,940 --> 00:03:11,380
So the Canterbury say happens in 2350.

50
00:03:11,380 --> 00:03:15,060
And in that they're just estimations, it's so we can move around and think about how

51
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:16,740
things relate to each other.

52
00:03:16,740 --> 00:03:21,780
And it's easier than using a before protomolecule after protomolecule scale, because that's

53
00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:26,020
discovered eight years before the series gets started.

54
00:03:26,020 --> 00:03:31,500
Not long after our present, the colonization of Mars gets underway in the expanse universe.

55
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:36,860
Over the next hundred years or so, the population of Earth continues to swell, ecological and

56
00:03:36,860 --> 00:03:42,060
climate disasters compound, and the damage to the ecosystem of Earth starts to reach

57
00:03:42,060 --> 00:03:43,860
critical levels.

58
00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:48,580
This leads to a shift in the development of space travel technologies, and this is probably

59
00:03:48,580 --> 00:03:51,980
when development on Luna really started to take off.

60
00:03:51,980 --> 00:03:56,940
During this period, the United Nations becomes Earth's unified government.

61
00:03:56,940 --> 00:04:02,900
After a few generations of being a UN colony, the people on Mars, who were largely self-sufficient

62
00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:06,260
by that time, started to push for independence.

63
00:04:06,260 --> 00:04:10,540
There are actually tensions here, and there was a real chance for war.

64
00:04:10,540 --> 00:04:15,260
It's kind of similar to the events of the American Revolution, the American colonies

65
00:04:15,260 --> 00:04:16,420
in Great Britain.

66
00:04:16,420 --> 00:04:21,980
And there may have been actual fighting if it weren't for a man named Solomon Epstein.

67
00:04:21,980 --> 00:04:27,860
Sometime around 2213, he makes a breakthrough and develops what will become to be known

68
00:04:27,860 --> 00:04:29,780
as the Epstein Drive.

69
00:04:29,780 --> 00:04:34,940
It's a modified fusion drive, and it makes it possible for humanity to start to colonize

70
00:04:34,940 --> 00:04:36,380
the solar system.

71
00:04:36,380 --> 00:04:41,660
As you can imagine, this was really valuable technology, and Mars decides to exchange the

72
00:04:41,660 --> 00:04:46,860
Epstein Drive, share it with the UN, in exchange for independence.

73
00:04:46,860 --> 00:04:50,820
From there, the Martian Congressional Republic is formed.

74
00:04:50,820 --> 00:04:56,340
In the next few generations, the UN and Mars start to spread out into the solar system.

75
00:04:56,340 --> 00:05:01,620
They go to the asteroid belt, they start to extract resources, and over the years colonization

76
00:05:01,620 --> 00:05:03,540
continues to expand.

77
00:05:03,540 --> 00:05:08,260
Differences like Ganymede show up at this time to become an agricultural center for

78
00:05:08,260 --> 00:05:13,580
the outer planets, and in those generations we start to see differences appear in the

79
00:05:13,580 --> 00:05:17,540
bodies of people who are developing in low gravity.

80
00:05:17,540 --> 00:05:21,300
This is where we get the differences between Inners and Belters.

81
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:25,540
There starts to be a slight difference between Earthers and people who grew up on Mars as

82
00:05:25,540 --> 00:05:26,540
well.

83
00:05:26,540 --> 00:05:31,140
It's in this period where the division lines between the three factions in our story become

84
00:05:31,140 --> 00:05:32,580
clearly defined.

85
00:05:32,620 --> 00:05:37,740
Earth is the birthplace of humanity, it's the homeworld, it's the superpower in the

86
00:05:37,740 --> 00:05:38,740
system.

87
00:05:38,740 --> 00:05:43,500
They've got a lot of problems on the planet itself, but they still have incredible power.

88
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:47,820
Mars has embarked on a generations-long terraforming project.

89
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:51,220
But something like that is just so far down the road.

90
00:05:51,220 --> 00:05:56,540
To counteract some of that power that Earth has in their superpower status, Mars has set

91
00:05:56,540 --> 00:05:59,140
out to build a powerful navy of their own.

92
00:05:59,140 --> 00:06:03,820
And of course some advanced military tech and some badass marines to go with it.

93
00:06:03,820 --> 00:06:08,740
And out in the belt, a lot of the people who went out there to try to strike it rich are

94
00:06:08,740 --> 00:06:12,740
finding themselves as an exploitable class of labor.

95
00:06:12,740 --> 00:06:17,580
The fact that these anatomical differences start to happen, when you can visibly see

96
00:06:17,580 --> 00:06:22,140
a difference in someone who grew up in the outer planets, that makes it even easier for

97
00:06:22,140 --> 00:06:23,740
them to be otherized.

98
00:06:23,740 --> 00:06:28,100
They might be people, but they're not Earthers, or even Martians for that matter.

99
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:31,180
So a life in the belt is one that's defined by oppression.

100
00:06:31,180 --> 00:06:37,220
This leads to the creation of the outer planets alliance at around the turn of the 24th century.

101
00:06:37,220 --> 00:06:41,660
At around 2330, Timmy becomes Amos and leaves Earth.

102
00:06:41,660 --> 00:06:47,020
Around that same time, Philip Inaros is born, and not long after that, the Augustine Gamara

103
00:06:47,020 --> 00:06:52,700
is destroyed by Marco and his fledgling faction of Radical OPA.

104
00:06:52,700 --> 00:06:57,020
At this time, Alex would be doing his 20 years that he did in the navy.

105
00:06:57,140 --> 00:07:01,860
Christian Avicerala would be moving her way up the ranks through the UN government.

106
00:07:01,860 --> 00:07:07,300
And in the late 2330s, James Holden will join the UN's navy and leave Earth.

107
00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:14,460
In 2339, UN Marine Colonel Fred Johnson led a raid on Anderson Station to retake it from

108
00:07:14,460 --> 00:07:15,460
striking workers.

109
00:07:15,460 --> 00:07:20,620
A lot of people died, including civilians who lived there, and he became infamous earning

110
00:07:20,620 --> 00:07:23,600
the title the Butcher of Anderson Station.

111
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:28,520
After learning that his superior set him up, he resigns, and eventually is recruited into

112
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:30,960
the OPA by Anderson Dawes.

113
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:36,640
So in 2342, Mars surveys Phoebe and discovers the protomolecule.

114
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:41,560
They partner with a corporation called Protogen in order to set up a long term facility to

115
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:44,760
investigate what this substance that they found is.

116
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:49,400
A couple years later, James Holden is dishonorably discharged from the navy.

117
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:54,000
After that, he goes and gets himself a job with the Pure and Clean Water Company, and

118
00:07:54,000 --> 00:08:00,440
about five years later, where the series starts, he's working on an ice hauler called the Canterbury.

119
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:04,280
Before we get into the timeline of events of the main story, I just want to say that

120
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:07,760
of course they play out a little bit differently between the books and the show.

121
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:11,280
In this video, I'm going to lean more towards the show because that's what people are more

122
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:15,640
familiar with, but with the caveat that while the details are different, they both end up

123
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:17,800
in the same place overall.

124
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:22,360
So at the beginning of the story, the future crew of the Rossinante are all working on

125
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:23,440
the Canterbury.

126
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:28,360
At the same time, Julie Mao boards a ship called the Scopulae, and they go looking for

127
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:33,520
a ship called the Anubis because she believes a weapon her father is working on is on that

128
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:34,520
ship.

129
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:37,920
She thinks if they can get a hold of that, they can make sure that this weapon is never

130
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:39,760
used against the Belters.

131
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:43,440
When they find the Anubis, they're surprised to learn that it's a stealth ship which they

132
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:47,960
have no chance against, and the Scopulae basically has to surrender.

133
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:52,120
Julie's taken prisoner, and she's put in a room while the crew of the Anubis tries

134
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:54,360
to figure out what to do with her.

135
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:58,560
Protogen then uses the Scopulae to send out a fake distress signal, which the Canterbury

136
00:08:58,560 --> 00:08:59,800
responds to.

137
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:05,720
Holden, Naomi, Alex, Amos, and Shed take a shuttle called the Knight to investigate.

138
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:09,720
While they're doing that, the Anubis arrives and destroys the Canterbury.

139
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:14,440
Holden's doing this in a plan to increase tensions between Earth and Mars so that they

140
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:19,520
can continue to do their protomolecule research without any interruption.

141
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:24,480
Because of the Anubis' stealth tech and the distress call coming from a Martian-made beacon,

142
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:29,800
everyone on the Knight begins to believe that Mars may be behind the attack on the Canter.

143
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:35,560
When the MCRN Donager responds to the Knight's distress call, Holden sends out a message

144
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:39,560
saying that there was Martian naval tech planted on the Scopulae.

145
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:42,760
So he inadvertently plays into Protogen's plan.

146
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:46,080
The survivors on the Knight are picked up by the Martian vessel.

147
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:49,920
It's attacked by more stealth ships, but they're able to escape on a frigate that's

148
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:52,640
docked inside that's named the Tachi.

149
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:56,000
The Martian Marine who helped them escape dies shortly after.

150
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,800
And so now Holden, Naomi, Alex, and Amos have their own ship.

151
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:04,720
Fred Johnson from the OPA reaches out to them and tells them that they can come to Tycho's

152
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:05,720
station.

153
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:10,400
In the process, the Tachi becomes the Rossinante.

154
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:13,280
Timeline-wise, Season 1 happens pretty fast.

155
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:18,160
Space travel does take time, but in Julie's flashback episode, we learn that the Scopulae

156
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:24,240
encountered the Anubis seven weeks prior to the Rossi crew and Detective Miller discovering

157
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:25,840
her on Eros.

158
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:30,600
After her bodies discovered, Protogen moves forward with their plan to conduct an experiment

159
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:33,720
with the protomolecule on a large population.

160
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:39,240
They intentionally contaminated the citizens of Eros and exposed them to radiation to speed

161
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:41,000
up the effects.

162
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:45,560
Season 1 of the show ends with them setting up the experiment where they can observe what

163
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:49,680
will happen when the protomolecule has that much biomass to work with.

164
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:54,400
There's no time jump in between seasons because Season 1 doesn't complete the first book.

165
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:58,720
I'm glossing over the political and military tensions and engagements between the three

166
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:02,400
factions because they're somewhat different books to show.

167
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:07,000
But we do see Phoebe Station destroyed by Mars in the beginning of Season 2.

168
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:11,680
In the big picture, things are working out for Protogen and Jules Pierre-Mau.

169
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:16,920
Up until the crew of the Rossi, Detective Miller and Fred Johnson launch a raid on Toss

170
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:17,920
Station.

171
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:21,760
This is where Anthony Dresden was coordinating the Eros experiment.

172
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:25,640
And after the raid is completed, Miller executes Dresden.

173
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:30,480
From there, they make a plan to push Eros into the sun, using the Mormon colony ship

174
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:32,560
the Navu as a battering ramp.

175
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:37,640
They also plan to rig Eros with explosives, and in the process of that, Miller gets stuck

176
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:38,640
there.

177
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:43,880
Just before the Navu crashes into Eros, it's able to move out of the way, and then it starts

178
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:45,740
accelerating towards Earth.

179
00:11:45,740 --> 00:11:50,000
This leads to the UN firing off a bunch of missiles in its direction.

180
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:54,160
But on Eros, Miller goes looking for Julie, because he's been hearing her voices in the

181
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:57,440
sounds of the protomolecule in the station.

182
00:11:57,440 --> 00:12:02,400
He's able to find what is basically her consciousness in a body made out of protomolecule.

183
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:07,920
And he's able to communicate, convincing her to guide Eros into Venus instead of Earth.

184
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:13,680
The station crashes to the surface of the planet, and this is where Josephus Miller dies.

185
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:18,660
This is the end of the first book, but it happens in the middle of Season 2 of the show.

186
00:12:18,660 --> 00:12:23,320
And this is where the timeline of the show starts to get condensed and they diverge.

187
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:28,520
In the first chapter of the second book, it says it's been 18 months since Eros.

188
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:33,600
In the show it seems somewhat seamless, as there isn't an indication of a lot of time

189
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:34,600
passing.

190
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:36,000
The same things happen though.

191
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:40,840
Kids start to go missing, Project Caliban is going on, they're testing protomolecule

192
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:46,840
human hybrids, and eventually one of those is released, leading to the conflict at Ganymede.

193
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:52,800
There one of the hybrids engages with UN and MCR forces on the ground, and that leads to

194
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:58,680
engagement in space, where the orbital mirrors that focus light on the planet are damaged

195
00:12:58,680 --> 00:13:03,740
and start to fall to the surface, compromising the agricultural domes.

196
00:13:03,740 --> 00:13:08,700
This leads to an armistice summit on Earth, Bobby becomes disillusioned with Mars in relation

197
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:14,240
to the handling of her reports about the hybrid, and ends up working with Avacerala.

198
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:18,960
They meet with Jules Pierre Mow on his yacht, and eventually escape on the razorback.

199
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:23,720
This eventually brings them in contact directly with the Rossinante crew, and that's when

200
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:25,840
they all meet for the first time.

201
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:30,880
On Venus, the science vessel the Arbrogast is deconstructed and absorbed into what the

202
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:33,440
protomolecule is building there.

203
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:38,360
Hostilities break out around Io, where work on the protomolecule hybrids is continuing.

204
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:43,040
This will turn out to be the last stand of Jules Pierre Mow and the people who are loyal

205
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:44,040
to him.

206
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:48,400
There's an attempt to launch protomolecule hybrids at Mars, which is stopped, and Jules

207
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:51,220
Pierre Mow is taken into custody.

208
00:13:51,220 --> 00:13:56,600
After that, the protomolecule project on Venus emerges from the planet and launches itself

209
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:58,920
towards the outer planets.

210
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:03,240
Just beyond Uranus, it becomes a ring gate, and this event brings the inner planets back

211
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:07,920
together as all efforts are focused on trying to understand what it is.

212
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:10,880
This is the transition between the second and third books.

213
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:14,200
Again, the condensing of the timeline is a little vague here.

214
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:19,280
Sometimes should have passed while it was traveling from Venus to Uranus, and then also

215
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:23,680
for the next event which is the EK slingshotting into the ring.

216
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:28,320
In the show we see that it takes the fleet going to investigate the rings more than six

217
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:31,240
months after it appeared to get there.

218
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:35,680
When they do, the ring is opened after the EK has flown into it.

219
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:40,960
Clarissa Mow sets her plan in motion to set up Holden by blowing up the Sung Yun.

220
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:46,360
The Rosinante becomes the first ship to enter the ring and survive as they're being chased

221
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:51,120
down by a torpedo from the behemoth, and then all the ships outside the ring gate follow

222
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:53,920
after entering the ring space.

223
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:59,120
Ever since the ring assembled, Holden has been seeing visions of the investigator, what

224
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:00,960
looks like Detective Miller.

225
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:07,560
He convinces him to go to the ring station and go inside to help him access the records.

226
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:12,120
While he's there, they both learn about what happened to the ring builder civilization,

227
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:16,200
how they were wiped out in an instant by the unknown aggressors.

228
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:20,560
While they were going to the center of the station, they were being pursued by Martian

229
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:25,440
Marines, and through acting like a threat, they caused the speed limit outside to be

230
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:27,140
slowed down again.

231
00:15:27,140 --> 00:15:32,240
This set up a situation where all the ships need to power down so they no longer appear

232
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:37,200
as a threat to the security system on the station, and after they do that the investigator

233
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:42,240
is able to turn off the system, eliminating the speed limit in the slow zone.

234
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:47,960
This is the end of the third book and the third season, and the Rosinante agrees to transport

235
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:52,720
Clarissa Mow back to Luna so she can be arrested for her crimes.

236
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:58,000
This is a months long journey, and this is where Amos and Clarissa form their friendship.

237
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:03,640
Moving into season four, this is the first time we see a one to one adaptation, as season

238
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:06,520
four just covers the fourth book more or less.

239
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:10,840
And the book's a lot of time passes because these are long journeys, but the show again

240
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:12,760
seems to condense things a little.

241
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:17,360
The time they spend on Illas isn't very long, most of the time that goes by would have happened

242
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:19,600
on their trip there and the way back.

243
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:24,280
What happens is a group of refugees from Ganymede run the blockade on the rings and

244
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:27,480
make it to the surface of a planet which they call Illas.

245
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:32,360
Avasarala is trying to stop a mad rush through the ring gates because that will essentially

246
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:34,240
destabilize Mars.

247
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:40,160
So she sends the Rosinante to act as a mediator between the belters that already are there

248
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:45,200
and an earth corporation that has a charter to extract lithium from the planet.

249
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:50,320
Secretly she hopes that things will fall apart, Holden being there won't help anything, and

250
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:54,800
he'll actually broadcast how precarious things are whenever you try to rush out to one of

251
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:57,240
these worlds, but that doesn't work out.

252
00:16:57,240 --> 00:17:01,800
Back when the hybrid was on the Rossi, it left behind some active protomolecule, and

253
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:06,720
that's what was acting as a note on the network, making it possible for the investigator to

254
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:08,160
appear to Holden.

255
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:13,200
So when the Rossi went to Illas, the investigator was able to activate all the protomolecule

256
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:14,640
tech on the planet.

257
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:20,720
In the process of that, he realized that there was a magic bullet left behind from the unknown

258
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:25,040
aggressors, and that was a weapon they used against the Ring Builder civilization.

259
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:30,840
He's able to use that to deactivate everything he turned on and avert crisis for everyone

260
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:32,360
on the planet.

261
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:37,120
Before he does that, he tells Holden to destroy the active protomolecule on the Rossi to make

262
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:39,960
sure something like that doesn't happen in the future.

263
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:44,000
So on Illas, things did get pretty bad, but almost everyone survived.

264
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:48,720
This is the opposite of what Abbasarala was hoping would happen, seeing that the situation

265
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:53,240
was survivable and that the Belters had a ship full of lithium that they'll be bringing

266
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:58,280
back to sell, only increased enthusiasm for people wanting to colonize the planets on

267
00:17:58,280 --> 00:18:00,160
the other side of the Ring Gates.

268
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:04,880
By destroying the active protomolecule on the Rossi, this trip marks the end of Holden's

269
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:07,240
connection to the Blue Goo.

270
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:12,280
So from there, we get into Season 5 and the Fifth Book, and the Rossi returns the Sol

271
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:17,680
System where the ship will have to be repaired, and that's going to take about six months.

272
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:22,560
The crew splits up at this time, and so if we look at the timeline, you could make it

273
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:27,920
work that this is 2355, like it showed on the opening screen.

274
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:32,360
At the end of Season 4, we saw the Free Navy get stealth tech and put the plan to throw

275
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:37,720
rocks at Earth in motion, but we don't know when that happened in relation to the Rossi's

276
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:39,760
return trip to Sol System.

277
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:45,200
In other words, some time may have passed between when Ashford was spaced and when they launched

278
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:46,200
the rocks.

279
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:50,280
And I mention that because at the beginning of Season 5, we see that it's been nearly

280
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:52,680
six months after the rocks have been launched.

281
00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:57,080
From there, the events that happened in Season 5 happened pretty quickly, and the books they

282
00:18:57,080 --> 00:19:03,040
say that it takes Amos and Clarissa about 14 days to get from the prison to Baltimore,

283
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:05,260
and everything else happens concurrently.

284
00:19:05,260 --> 00:19:10,400
So the rocks hit Earth, Tycho Station is attacked, Fred Johnson is killed, the breakaway

285
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:14,840
Martian Fleet burns towards the Ring, and at the end of the Fifth Season, we have the

286
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:20,440
battle for Soulgate, and the Bar Keith disappearing as it passes through the Laconia Ring.

287
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:25,400
In the show's version of events, we lose our first Rossi crew member, too, when Alex strokes

288
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:27,240
out after a hygiene maneuver.

289
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:28,960
This hasn't happened in the books yet.

290
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:34,360
The actor who portrayed him was fired by the show after more than 40 allegations of abuse

291
00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:39,360
and harassment made by fans and co-workers, so they decided to kill him off.

292
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:41,680
Three major things happen in Season 5.

293
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:47,320
The asteroid attack against Earth, the breakaway Martian Fleet taking Fred Johnson's protomolecule

294
00:19:47,320 --> 00:19:52,340
sample and passing through the Ring gates to the Laconia System, where they plan to start

295
00:19:52,340 --> 00:19:57,260
their own civilization using the protomolecule to help them advance.

296
00:19:57,260 --> 00:20:02,140
And the rise of the Free Navy and Soul System, where they took control of Medina Station,

297
00:20:02,140 --> 00:20:06,740
which means they now have control of any traffic going through the Rings.

298
00:20:06,740 --> 00:20:11,380
By the end of working on this, I can say I understand why the authors chose to keep the

299
00:20:11,380 --> 00:20:13,920
timeline vague when they developed the story.

300
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:18,780
There aren't many examples of blatant discrepancies in the timelines of the books.

301
00:20:18,780 --> 00:20:22,940
These mostly make sense when you look at it closely, but there is a lot of discussion

302
00:20:22,940 --> 00:20:27,380
about whether some of the travel times that show up there are correct or not.

303
00:20:27,380 --> 00:20:30,780
And I'm not a math guy, so that's beyond my skill set.

304
00:20:30,780 --> 00:20:34,700
One of the first things I noticed when I started looking at the timeline in the past is that

305
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:38,700
most of what happens inside any of the books happens pretty quickly.

306
00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:43,580
And then the real time passes in between when they're traveling or if there's just downtime

307
00:20:43,580 --> 00:20:46,760
between where one book ends and the next one picks up.

308
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:51,140
Based on the obvious markers, I think the timeline of the books through number 5 is

309
00:20:51,140 --> 00:20:56,820
between 8 to 11 years, and the show seems to condense that into a 5 year span.

310
00:20:56,820 --> 00:20:59,380
And I think that is a great place to leave things.

311
00:20:59,380 --> 00:21:03,780
We can continue the conversation in the comments, so make sure to let me know what you think.

312
00:21:03,780 --> 00:21:05,380
What do you think of the timeline?

313
00:21:05,380 --> 00:21:08,980
Do you think it should take longer like it did in the books, or do you like how the show

314
00:21:08,980 --> 00:21:10,980
condense things down?

315
00:21:10,980 --> 00:21:13,060

I'll talk to you soon.
