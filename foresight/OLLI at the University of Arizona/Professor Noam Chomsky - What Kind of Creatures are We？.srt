1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:18,120
All right, well, Noam Chomsky, I think it's time for me to turn this over to you.

2
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:25,640
I really want to give you a great big welcome from OliU of A and appreciate your coming today

3
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:31,800
and presenting to our organization and we're truly an honor and a privilege to have you

4
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:38,520
with us and I know that a number of emails have gone out and I don't think any introduction

5
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:48,160
is honestly needed because but can you hear me thank you for joining us and I'll let you

6
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:49,680
take it over.

7
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:59,920
Okay, thank you very much. I'd like to have a few words about the maker of language,

8
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:11,200
its acquisition, origins, its use and so far as we understand these matters today and I'd like to

9
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:22,040
approach this within the broader context of the inquiry into language and mind which are

10
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:32,640
the distinctive properties of the human species. Well, good place to start is at the beginning of

11
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:43,000
their historical records, classical Greece, the Delphic Oracle, which produced the maxim,

12
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:58,040
know thyself. Well, two word aphorism is open to many interpretations. The intended

13
00:01:58,040 --> 00:02:08,760
interpretation was individual, you the individual should know yourself and unexamined life is not

14
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:18,360
worth living, the platonic expansion of this, but it makes good sense to understand the maxim of

15
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:29,040
the oracle collectively, know ourselves. The reason is that we're pretty much similar. It's a

16
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:39,680
very young species. Humans have only been around for two to 300,000 years. That's early in eye

17
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:51,440
blink and evolutionary time. It's been mentioned by evolutionary biologists, partly as a joke,

18
00:02:51,440 --> 00:03:01,840
partly real, that if you see two squirrels in a tree outside your window, they very likely are

19
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:12,920
more diverse genetically than all of the humans in the world. Humans have arisen within a very

20
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:22,200
narrow window of evolutionary time and they have unique properties. One of these properties is

21
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:31,480
human language. There's no analog, no similar properties anywhere in the organic world.

22
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:42,320
Furthermore, it's a species property. It's not only unique to humans, but uniform among humans.

23
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:54,160
It means that any infant can acquire any language with equal facility, as far as we know. So it's

24
00:03:54,160 --> 00:04:04,200
a species property, virtually definitive of humans. There is another one thought, at least thought in

25
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:14,440
any form that we can grasp and understand. The kind of thought that made it possible to produce the

26
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:24,200
maxim of the oracle, to interpret it, to reflect on its significance, myriad other mental activities

27
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:38,280
that occupy us all day, even in sleep, just again a common human property, totally unique to humans.

28
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:48,040
Well, when you have two unique species properties, it makes good sense to ask what relation holds

29
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:56,760
between them. The simplest relation would be simply identity. Language constructs thought.

30
00:04:57,640 --> 00:05:04,600
Thought is what is constructed by language and that is the conclusion that was reached

31
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:16,360
2,500 years ago, classical India, classical Greece, and it's a tradition that runs through millennia.

32
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:27,000
Late 19th century, a great American linguist, William Whitney, simply defined language as

33
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:34,600
audible thought, basically thought, which we happen to externalize through the mouth,

34
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:42,920
pick up through the ear. We now know that that's too narrow. You can use any other sensory motor

35
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:52,360
system. So if I don't know if this is being translated into sign, but if it is, you would be

36
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:59,400
seeing the same thing in sign language, which works very much the same as spoken language,

37
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:07,000
in the way it's acquired structure, the way it's used down to small details,

38
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:15,160
even the way it's norally stored. Well, you can think of the language as being

39
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:24,760
kind of like a program that's in your laptop. So suppose you have a program in your laptop,

40
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:33,400
calculator, or say, multiplying numbers. The program works by itself. You can attach it to a

41
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:44,520
printer, could be a printer that uses colors, dark letters, and one font, another font. The program

42
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:54,200
doesn't care. It can be hooked up to, sorry, try to be louder. It can be hooked up, is this any better?

43
00:06:55,400 --> 00:07:03,880
Can be hooked up to any printer that you want. The program stays the same. And language seems

44
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:11,880
very much like that. There's an internal system constructing thoughts. It can be hooked up to

45
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:20,440
one sensory motor system or another to externalize it. But the program seemed to be the same.

46
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:28,280
Well, let me make a side comment here on the history and then return to the

47
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:37,240
mainstream of the discussion. What I've just been describing is basically the long millennial,

48
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:44,600
long tradition of the study of language in mind that goes right into the 20th century.

49
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:56,840
Early 20th century had changed. The general view in the early 20th century still largely surviving

50
00:07:57,480 --> 00:08:05,160
is that language is not primarily an instrument, the means of thought, but rather it's a system

51
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:16,600
of communication. That's sort of the mantra today in philosophy of language, much of linguistics,

52
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:26,600
cognitive science. This, I think, is a result of the rise of behaviorism in the 20th century,

53
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:39,400
which drove scientists, philosophers, others to look at what's visible, what's apparent,

54
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:47,160
behavior, to keep away from hidden things like what's going on in your mind. That was a very

55
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:54,600
sharp departure from the scientific tradition. It's very anti-scientific in my view. It became

56
00:08:55,560 --> 00:09:01,560
quite dominant, especially in the first half of the 20th century. There's also a kind of a

57
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:09,160
primitive version of Darwinism, which does have its roots in Darwin's writings,

58
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:18,840
the idea that all changes through evolution must be small changes, which operate through

59
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:28,280
natural selection and over time may give large-scale differences. It's now known that that's

60
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:39,080
completely false, but the residue of that does lead you to the belief, the illusion in my view,

61
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:46,920
that language somehow must have emerged from simpler systems, going back to

62
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:53,800
animal communication. The evidence is strongly against that, and there's nothing in

63
00:09:53,800 --> 00:10:00,120
evolutionary biology that leads to such conclusions. Actually, this is,

64
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:11,080
notice that this behaviorist turn is a turn away from the effort to understand and explain

65
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:21,240
in effort to describe basically what you see in Silicon Valley linguistics, the kind that makes

66
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:29,640
the headlines about the things that it's claimed that machines can do. Associated with this was

67
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:36,760
conception of how language is acquired, dominant conception, philosophy of language,

68
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:45,160
linguistics, language is acquired through training and instituting habits,

69
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:53,800
if there's anything new that's said by analogy, all completely wrong, completely reshuted,

70
00:10:53,800 --> 00:11:00,440
still very common. Well, let's go back to the tradition, which I think was on the right course.

71
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:10,200
The study of language took a large step forward with the 17th century scientific revolution.

72
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:20,360
The primary lesson of the scientific revolution was that you should be puzzled by simple things

73
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:29,640
that you take for granted. So, a heavy ball of lid plainly falls faster than a light one.

74
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:38,360
Except that it doesn't, as Galileo showed with elegant thought experiments,

75
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:48,840
take a sailboat moving through the sea. I suppose there's a lid ball on the top of the mast.

76
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:58,920
If it falls, it should fall behind the mast. Of course, the sailboat is moving forward, except

77
00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:07,960
that it doesn't fall to the base of the mast. Again, Galileo showed this with thought experiments.

78
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:15,240
If he'd done an actual experiment, the results would have been all over the place. But as in

79
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:25,080
much of science, then and since, the idea was to construct ideal situations, often by thought,

80
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:35,160
sometimes by careful experiment, if you can, that bring out the hidden reality between behind the

81
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:44,760
phenomena that you see, which are always complex. Many variables can't be studied. That's why

82
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:52,120
scientists do experiments. Well, if you go back to scholastic science in the 16th century,

83
00:12:52,920 --> 00:13:01,720
what Galileo and his contemporaries were struggling against, scholastic science had answers to

84
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:10,040
everything. If a ball falls to the ground and steam rises, it's because they're going to their

85
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:19,240
natural place. If two objects attract or repel each other, it's because they have sympathies

86
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:27,560
and antipathies. If you perceive a triangle, it's because the form of the triangle

87
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:34,760
passes through the air and implants itself in your brain. So there was an answer to everything.

88
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:43,880
All the answers were wrong. They were based on what modern science called occult qualities,

89
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:53,240
invented concepts that don't exist, and the willingness to be puzzled by things opened the

90
00:13:53,240 --> 00:14:01,800
door to the new science, the science of the last several hundred years. The scholastic science

91
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:10,600
had answers to everything. The new science had no answers to anything. That's how serious inquiry

92
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:18,360
begins. And the same has been true of the study of language in the last 60 or 70 years,

93
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:26,200
breaking with the behaviorist, structuralist tradition. Well, let's take a look at language.

94
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:34,680
There are simple things that we take for granted. We talk to each other. We understand each other.

95
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:43,880
What could be simpler than that? Well, to the new scientists, Galileo and his contemporaries,

96
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:51,880
this seemed an extraordinary puzzle. Amazing. How can it be that with just

97
00:14:52,920 --> 00:15:00,040
a few symbols we can produce, we can construct in our minds infinitely many thoughts,

98
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:07,400
never before expressed, never in the history of the language, and we can even

99
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:17,480
convey to others who have no access to our minds, we can convey to them the innermost

100
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:26,200
working of our minds. They regarded this as an amazing phenomenon. In fact, Galileo himself

101
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:35,080
regarded the alphabet as the most spectacular of human inventions because it facilitated this

102
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:49,400
astonishing quality. And it is indeed a remarkable fact. It's been repeated by others. One famous case

103
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:59,560
is Gottlob Frege a couple of centuries later, the founder of modern logic and logical philosophy

104
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:08,920
mid-19th century. He wrote that, I'm quoting him, he found it astonishing what language

105
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:17,560
accomplishes. With a few syllables, it expresses a countless number of thoughts and even for a

106
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:26,040
thought grasped for the first time by a human, it provides a clothing in which it can be recognized

107
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:37,000
by another to whom it is entirely new. It's essentially Galileo's insight. And it raises

108
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:51,080
very deep questions. How can this possibly be the case? This initiated a rich study of what

109
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:58,920
centuries study of what was called universal and rational grammar. Universal because it tried to

110
00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:06,600
cover all languages. Rational because it was interested in explanation and not description.

111
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:15,400
Very different from the structural linguistics and philosophy of language of the first half

112
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:24,680
of the 20th century, which described itself as a taxonomic science. We have procedures of analysis

113
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:35,000
you can apply them to data that you come up with an organization of the data. It's basically today's

114
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:41,640
Silicon Valley. That's doesn't care about understanding, doesn't care about explanation,

115
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:51,320
just organization of data. A radical change from traditional science, including the science of

116
00:17:51,320 --> 00:18:01,480
language. Again, the old tradition was picked up, revived around mid 20th century. Well,

117
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:11,400
it does raise the problems for Descartes in the 17th century. It was the basis for his establishment

118
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:23,560
of the classical mind body problem. Descartes accepted the basic idea of the new science, Galileo,

119
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:31,800
Royal Society in England, later Newton, others that the world is basically a machine,

120
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:40,840
a complex machine, the kind of machine that could be built in principle by a skilled artisan,

121
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:49,640
and that in their theology in fact was created by a super skilled artisan. Machine means something

122
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:58,760
built out of gears and levers and pulleys and so on. That's the world. But Descartes recognized

123
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:08,840
that there are certain things that didn't seem to fall within machine science, what was called at

124
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:16,440
the time mechanical philosophy. Philosophy meant science. So there were things that didn't fall

125
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:27,480
within it. One of the most striking ones Descartes felt correctly is the creative aspect of language

126
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:37,960
use. What amazed Galileo, his contemporaries centuries later, Freda, how is this possible

127
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:46,680
for a machine? It is impossible for a machine. And that led Descartes, a sensible scientist,

128
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:56,120
to postulate a new principle, a thinking principle, mind. That's the mind body problem.

129
00:19:57,160 --> 00:20:05,960
Next task for Descartes and other sciences was to see how they're unified. Well, I quickly

130
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:13,320
ran into, sorry, somebody's at the door, my dogs are unhappy about it.

131
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:28,840
This collapsed pretty quickly. Isaac Newton's great discovery was that the world is not a machine.

132
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:36,360
There are no machines. There are no bodies in the sense, any sense of body that we have.

133
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:44,840
The world is just not intelligible to us. That was the criterion of intelligibility.

134
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:56,280
John Locke immediately recognized that, as he put it within his theological framework,

135
00:20:57,160 --> 00:21:06,280
just as God has attributed to whatever exists, properties that we cannot conceive,

136
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:15,160
like interaction without contact. So God may have super added to whatever there is,

137
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:23,480
the property of thought. Thought is just a property of organized matter, whatever matter,

138
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:35,080
turns out to be. All of this was worked out extensively through the 18th century,

139
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:44,840
then forgotten, totally forgotten, revived in the mid 20th century. It's now become

140
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:55,080
a standard idea after a long period of neglect. Well, that leaves us with serious mysteries.

141
00:21:55,960 --> 00:22:03,960
How is all of this possible? And the answer to that question is, we don't know. We do not know

142
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:13,720
how it is possible to answer Galileo, how it is possible for or frigate with a small number of

143
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:24,440
symbols to construct new thoughts, new to us, maybe new in history, to somehow transmit them

144
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:32,280
to others in such a way that they can interpret the inner workings of our minds. A lot of this is

145
00:22:32,840 --> 00:22:41,640
just unintelligible to us. Well, there are parts of it that we can understand.

146
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:48,360
Here, we have to make a distinction, which was actually discussed by Aristotle,

147
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:56,760
but then forgotten until the 20th century. The distinction is between possession of knowledge

148
00:22:56,760 --> 00:23:05,720
and use of knowledge. It's a crucial distinction in modern technical terminology. For those of

149
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:13,320
you familiar with that, that's the distinction between what's called competence and performance,

150
00:23:14,040 --> 00:23:26,760
what we know and what we use. The internal language provides us with a store of an infinite

151
00:23:26,840 --> 00:23:38,440
number of possible thoughts. That's our possession of knowledge. Our use of knowledge is perception

152
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:49,160
and production. When you perceive the noises that I'm making, you are accessing your internal store

153
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:56,840
of knowledge to provide an interpretation for these noises that you're hearing. When I produce a

154
00:23:56,840 --> 00:24:06,440
sentence, I'm carrying out two acts. The first act is selecting a thought from the store of

155
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:16,120
possible thoughts. The second act is implementing it using the various mechanisms of my mind,

156
00:24:16,120 --> 00:24:24,840
my articulatory system to externalize that internal thought. The second part of it,

157
00:24:24,840 --> 00:24:31,640
we can study and understand. The first part of it, selecting the thought, is completely

158
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:39,240
beyond our understanding. We have no idea how this takes place. It's part of the general mystery of

159
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:50,840
voluntary action, which is basically to us an impenetrable mystery. Well, just keeping to what

160
00:24:50,840 --> 00:25:00,200
we can hope to understand, the system of language that constructs thoughts, the formation of the

161
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:09,800
internal language, keeping to that, we can discover some quite remarkable properties.

162
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:19,080
Following the tradition of early modern science, let's take simple cases. Take the sentence,

163
00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:30,680
the bombing of the cities is a crime. Notice it's is a crime, not are a crime. Actually,

164
00:25:30,680 --> 00:25:37,960
that's puzzling when you think about it. Why doesn't the verb is agree with the closest

165
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:46,360
noun phrase? The closest noun phrase is cities. So why don't we say the bombing of the cities

166
00:25:46,360 --> 00:25:57,240
are a crime? Okay, let's take the bombings of the city is a crime, or a crime, the bombings of the

167
00:25:57,240 --> 00:26:06,440
city are a crime. Why don't we say the bombings of the city is a crime? Again, just using the

168
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:13,240
simple problem for property of adjacency. When you look at it, you see that what humans are doing

169
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:26,440
is ignoring the simplest possible computational procedure, adjacency, and instead using a complex

170
00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:34,520
procedure, finding, not looking just at the linear order of words, but finding a structure,

171
00:26:34,520 --> 00:26:41,720
and then finding the central element within that structure. It turns out to be pretty complicated

172
00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:49,720
computation. But that's what we do reflexively. And in fact, that's what every infant does.

173
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:59,480
You can show by experiment that this is what infants do down to before the age of two 30 months

174
00:26:59,480 --> 00:27:07,080
of age can't obviously can. And this is true of all constructions in all languages.

175
00:27:08,040 --> 00:27:14,040
Just to give another example, a little more complicated, take the sentence,

176
00:27:16,280 --> 00:27:27,160
the man who fixed the car carefully packed his tools. The man who fixed the car carefully

177
00:27:27,160 --> 00:27:34,360
packed his tools. Notice it's ambiguous. He could fix the car carefully, or he could carefully

178
00:27:34,360 --> 00:27:43,640
pack his tools. Now put the adverb carefully in the front of the sentence. Carefully, the man who

179
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:53,640
fixed the car packed his tools. Unambiguous. It means carefully packed his tools. And it's

180
00:27:53,640 --> 00:28:00,840
unambiguous in a puzzling way. Carefully looks for a verb, but it doesn't look for the closest

181
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:08,520
verb. It looks for the more remote one, which if you build up the structure is the structurally

182
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:16,760
closest one. So what you're doing is what everyone is doing reflexively is ignoring

183
00:28:18,120 --> 00:28:26,840
the linear order of words and attending only to structures that you never hear and that your

184
00:28:26,840 --> 00:28:36,200
mind creates. Give one last example, take the sentence, the man who saw Bill is young.

185
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:48,280
Suppose I didn't hear the word Bill clearly. I say, I want to ask who it is. So I say, who is the man

186
00:28:48,280 --> 00:29:00,280
who saw young? Jibberish. Can't say that. Fine thought. You can't say it. You have to, you can only

187
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:11,640
say you can't use the simplest computational procedure and find the closest occurrence of who

188
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:21,000
and put it in the front. Splock. Well, this is universal. As I say, children of 30 months old

189
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:29,160
know it, all constructions, all languages. What it means is the infant, all infants,

190
00:29:29,160 --> 00:29:37,720
are ignoring 100% of what they hear, which is words in linear order. They're ignoring

191
00:29:38,360 --> 00:29:47,480
very simple computations on linear order and they are reflexively paying attention to something

192
00:29:47,480 --> 00:29:55,240
they never hear that their minds create and using computations on those abstract structures.

193
00:29:56,120 --> 00:30:02,840
It's a pretty remarkable fact when you think about it and that is the kind of thing we discover

194
00:30:03,560 --> 00:30:12,840
as soon as you try to answer the Galilean challenge. This property is called structure

195
00:30:12,840 --> 00:30:19,480
dependence in the technical literature. Pretty much the same as true of learning of words.

196
00:30:20,440 --> 00:30:30,600
There is a myth, standard myth, that the way children learn words is they see a cat. Their

197
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:39,240
mother says cat. They make an association between the thing they see and the sound your mother produced

198
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:46,520
and this is repeated over and over again in many circumstances, different situations. Finally,

199
00:30:46,520 --> 00:30:55,160
the kid figures out that the sound cat goes along with that feline object. Totally false.

200
00:30:55,880 --> 00:31:01,640
Nothing like that happens. There's a very careful experimentation on this by now.

201
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:12,120
Primary research and this is wonderful scientist, Lila Gleitman, who old friend passed away a couple

202
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:22,120
of weeks ago. What Lila Gleitman showed in her experiments is that children pick up words and

203
00:31:22,120 --> 00:31:32,760
the meaning of words on one or two presentations. At the peak period of language learning,

204
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:41,080
around two years old, children are picking up words at about one every waking hour,

205
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:48,760
which means that they hear them once, maybe twice. They usually don't pay attention to

206
00:31:48,760 --> 00:31:54,280
their mothers, just whatever is going on in the circumstances and they know the meanings of the

207
00:31:54,280 --> 00:32:02,520
words. The meaning of the word, when you look at it, is very complex. No time to go into this,

208
00:32:02,520 --> 00:32:09,720
but when you really look at the meanings of words, you find out that they are quite rich.

209
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:17,080
Well, actually, let me mention a few examples from classical Greece where this matter was discussed.

210
00:32:18,040 --> 00:32:27,160
So, take Aristotle again. He took us as an example, the word house. He said,

211
00:32:27,800 --> 00:32:36,040
what is a house? What's the meaning of the word house? And he said, well, it has two components.

212
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:46,120
One is what he called matter. It's the bricks, the timbers, the physical things that the

213
00:32:46,760 --> 00:32:53,320
house is made up of. The other is what he called form, an idea in the mind.

214
00:32:54,680 --> 00:33:02,360
The characteristic way the object is used, the thought in the mind of the architect who

215
00:33:02,360 --> 00:33:09,480
constructed the way we conceive of it. So, something could look exactly like a house,

216
00:33:10,600 --> 00:33:18,120
physically, but it could be a library, if that's the way it's used. It could be a garage,

217
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:25,240
could be a stable, could actually be a paperweight for a giant, could be whatever

218
00:33:25,640 --> 00:33:32,840
we conceive of it, whatever the architect has in mind. That is a consequence, and that's quite correct.

219
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:41,400
That means that a physicist looking at the object couldn't know the meaning of the word.

220
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:49,960
That means that the child, when it's learning the meaning of the word, is using all of this

221
00:33:50,600 --> 00:34:00,040
intricate understanding in the mind, none of it presented as evidence. Furthermore, that's true

222
00:34:00,040 --> 00:34:07,560
of every word in the language. Let's take an earlier example, pre-socratic, heraclitus,

223
00:34:08,520 --> 00:34:14,280
ask a rather profound question. How can you cross the same river twice?

224
00:34:14,920 --> 00:34:22,040
The second time you cross it, it's a physically different object. In fact, it could be radically

225
00:34:22,040 --> 00:34:32,360
different. It could be flowing in the opposite direction. It could be not water, but arsenic

226
00:34:32,440 --> 00:34:46,200
from an upstream plant. It could have been divided into several trihitoris. It could be like the

227
00:34:46,200 --> 00:34:54,200
river I pass on the way to work here in Tucson, where I live, the Rolito River, which never has

228
00:34:54,200 --> 00:35:01,400
any water in it. It's a dry bed, but it's the Rolito River, because every once in a while you

229
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:08,600
get a trickle of water through it. Historically, it was a river. It's a river. It's all the way

230
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:18,040
we conceive it. You could take the Rolito River, start using it for commuting to Tucson. It would

231
00:35:18,040 --> 00:35:26,280
be a highway, not the river. Physically, it hasn't changed at all. That's, again, true of all the

232
00:35:26,280 --> 00:35:34,840
words in our vocabulary. One special case of it is called polysomy. I suppose I say

233
00:35:38,360 --> 00:35:49,480
the book is harder to understand than it is to burn. What's the book? It's simultaneously

234
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:57,160
abstract, because you can understand it and concrete, because you can burn it. The world

235
00:35:57,160 --> 00:36:03,880
doesn't contain objects that are both concrete and abstract, but our mind constructs them.

236
00:36:04,840 --> 00:36:11,480
And that's what the words of language are. And these are learned virtually without experience.

237
00:36:12,440 --> 00:36:19,320
Another, this one is a real mystery. We don't know how that's done, but it's a fact that has to be

238
00:36:19,320 --> 00:36:27,080
explained. Well, these are among the amazing things that you discover as soon as you begin

239
00:36:27,080 --> 00:36:36,520
to look at the facts closely. One conclusion we have to draw is that language, what we call

240
00:36:36,520 --> 00:36:46,040
language, has two completely separate components. One of them is an internal language that constructs

241
00:36:46,040 --> 00:36:55,640
thoughts, has no order, no linear order, just abstract structures. The second part is a system

242
00:36:55,640 --> 00:37:04,680
that externalizes it into one or another sensory motor, medium, usually sound, could be sign,

243
00:37:05,240 --> 00:37:15,320
could even be touch. Notice that that second component is an amalgam of language and sensory

244
00:37:15,640 --> 00:37:22,600
motor systems. It's not pure language. Sensory motor systems have nothing to do with language.

245
00:37:23,320 --> 00:37:30,200
They were in place long before language emerged. They have not changed since language was

246
00:37:31,160 --> 00:37:38,440
emerged in the evolutionary record. So there's something extraneous to language,

247
00:37:39,160 --> 00:37:47,720
kind of like the printer that your laptop could be attached to. Well, and that of course has

248
00:37:47,720 --> 00:38:00,120
linear order and does use adjacency and other things. Well, when you try to find explanations

249
00:38:00,120 --> 00:38:13,000
for language, you, real explanations, you face a kind of conundrum. A trial learns language with

250
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:21,880
virtually no evidence. Actual statistical studies of the data available to children

251
00:38:21,880 --> 00:38:30,040
show that it's very sparse, very little. And as I mentioned, they know things for which they have

252
00:38:30,040 --> 00:38:37,800
no evidence at all, like structure dependence. So that makes it seem as though what's innate,

253
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:47,080
internal to the mind, must be very rich in order to carry the child from extremely limited data

254
00:38:47,720 --> 00:38:56,440
to very rich possession of knowledge. So on the one hand, the learning, the internal structure

255
00:38:56,440 --> 00:39:04,920
must be very rich. But then there's another problem. This system had to evolve. Well,

256
00:39:06,280 --> 00:39:16,520
it evolved in a very brief period of time. We now know from genomic analysis that human beings began

257
00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:27,240
to separate at least 150,000 years ago. And they all have the same faculty of language,

258
00:39:27,880 --> 00:39:34,840
same possession of knowledge, of language, same possession of knowledge. So it was in place

259
00:39:35,560 --> 00:39:43,800
before 150,000 years ago. Well, that's not long after humans emerged. As I said, humans emerge

260
00:39:44,520 --> 00:39:51,640
maybe 200,000 to 300,000 years ago. That's a very narrow window in evolutionary time.

261
00:39:54,600 --> 00:40:02,920
Click up an eye. Before humans emerged, there's no evidence in the archaeological record

262
00:40:03,480 --> 00:40:12,680
for any kind of symbolic activity. After humans emerged pretty soon in evolutionary time,

263
00:40:12,680 --> 00:40:21,960
you had very rich symbolic activity. Ordinarily assume plausibly that this is associated with the

264
00:40:21,960 --> 00:40:28,840
emergence of language. Well, what that seems to mean is that the basic

265
00:40:29,880 --> 00:40:38,440
faculty of language must be quite simple since it emerged so quickly in evolutionary time.

266
00:40:39,320 --> 00:40:48,360
But now we have a conundrum looking at acquisition. Looks like the internal innate system must be

267
00:40:48,360 --> 00:40:58,680
very rich. Looking at evolution seems like it must be very simple. I should say the first problem

268
00:40:58,680 --> 00:41:05,240
acquisition is sometimes called Plato's problem. Plato did raise the question,

269
00:41:05,960 --> 00:41:13,560
how can we know so much with so little evidence? Didn't really have an answer.

270
00:41:15,880 --> 00:41:23,960
The second question is sometimes called Darwin's problem. How could we evolve such a system

271
00:41:23,960 --> 00:41:32,520
so quickly? So it must be both very complex and very simple. There's a third problem,

272
00:41:33,080 --> 00:41:40,520
whatever the faculty of language is, it has to be universal. It has to cover all languages,

273
00:41:41,160 --> 00:41:49,000
because an infant has equal access to all of them. Well, it's this collection of problems that has

274
00:41:49,720 --> 00:42:01,000
guided the inquiry into language for the last 60 or 70 years since the abandonment of the

275
00:42:01,640 --> 00:42:08,600
behaviorist structural restrictions and the return to what had been the tradition.

276
00:42:09,480 --> 00:42:18,600
And it seems that finally in the last few years we are getting to the point where we may have

277
00:42:18,600 --> 00:42:27,560
answers to these questions. So that, if it were to the extent it works out, is actually a new era

278
00:42:28,280 --> 00:42:38,920
in the long millennial long study of language. The first time when we can reach genuine explanations,

279
00:42:39,720 --> 00:42:49,240
satisfying, answering Plato's problem, Darwin's problem, and the universality of the theory.

280
00:42:49,800 --> 00:42:58,280
So let's look first at the universality. It seems recent research is increasingly

281
00:43:00,440 --> 00:43:07,320
attending towards the conclusion that the diversity of language is in the externalization

282
00:43:07,400 --> 00:43:20,040
and superficial things like choice of lexical, the way you, the sound you associate with a lexical

283
00:43:20,040 --> 00:43:32,200
item. So it could be, you know, Cat in English, Cha in French, something else in some other language.

284
00:43:33,160 --> 00:43:39,640
But that's superficial. That, of course, you can learn easily. But the concept, the

285
00:43:40,440 --> 00:43:47,640
meaning of the word that's already inside. So one aspect of variety is just

286
00:43:49,320 --> 00:43:57,240
association of sound and symbol. That's easy. There are others. There are many, the variety of

287
00:43:57,320 --> 00:44:04,920
languages looks on the surface, very large. So there are some languages. English happens to be a

288
00:44:04,920 --> 00:44:12,280
what's called a highly analytic language. Lots of simple words from one after the other to make

289
00:44:12,280 --> 00:44:18,280
a sentence. There are other languages at the opposite extreme. A sentence could be one word.

290
00:44:19,240 --> 00:44:27,800
And other words could be scattered around freely. Well, it's by now been learned over recent years

291
00:44:27,800 --> 00:44:33,640
that these apparently radically different languages are almost identical

292
00:44:34,600 --> 00:44:41,800
at the deeper level. They have the same internals, very much the same, maybe exactly the same

293
00:44:41,880 --> 00:44:49,160
internal structure, the internal language, the one that generates thoughts looks as if it's

294
00:44:50,440 --> 00:44:56,760
pretty much the same, maybe exactly the same, no matter how different the superficial appearance.

295
00:44:57,800 --> 00:45:05,800
I think that's not too surprising. The internal language can't be learned. We have absolutely

296
00:45:05,800 --> 00:45:11,320
almost no evidence for it. It's true of the meaning of words, true of things like structure,

297
00:45:11,880 --> 00:45:17,800
dependence, other major properties of language. So it makes sense for it to be

298
00:45:18,520 --> 00:45:26,680
identical among people or close to that. On the other hand, the externalization is not strictly

299
00:45:26,680 --> 00:45:33,240
language. Remember, it's an amalgam of language and sensory motor systems,

300
00:45:33,880 --> 00:45:39,880
which are totally divorced from language. Well, connecting these two things is

301
00:45:40,680 --> 00:45:46,680
fairly complex process. Two things that have no relation to one another can be done in many

302
00:45:46,680 --> 00:45:55,160
different ways. It's basically solving a hard cognitive problem. Different communities have

303
00:45:55,160 --> 00:46:01,880
solved the problem in different ways. So it looks complex. It's a complex problem.

304
00:46:02,840 --> 00:46:10,840
The internal language looks quite simple because it's based on very simple computational procedures.

305
00:46:11,640 --> 00:46:14,920
So on the one hand, we solve the problem of

306
00:46:16,920 --> 00:46:23,560
Darwin's problem. We have a very simple system. Solve the problem of

307
00:46:23,560 --> 00:46:33,640
Plato's problem because the learning is all in the superficial part. The internal part just

308
00:46:33,640 --> 00:46:39,880
isn't learned. It's just there, like structure, dependence, the ways of interpreting those sentences

309
00:46:39,880 --> 00:46:46,440
that I gave. And the variety is where you expect it to be in the complex problem of

310
00:46:47,400 --> 00:46:54,920
relating the internal language that produces thought to the external system that

311
00:46:55,960 --> 00:47:03,000
translates, that hands it over to the printer that allows other people to read and see and

312
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:10,360
interpret it. To the extent that that can work out, you have genuine explanations.

313
00:47:11,080 --> 00:47:17,000
Well, that carries us on to the next chapter. How has it worked out?

314
00:47:18,040 --> 00:47:25,720
I'm going to give the barest hint of that here. So let's take the major principle of language,

315
00:47:26,760 --> 00:47:33,000
structure, dependence. Pretty remarkable principle. I wasn't even noticed until

316
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:43,000
fairly recently in all the history of language. Again, the fact that all operations of the

317
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:49,400
internal language, not externalization, all operations of the internal language that generates

318
00:47:49,400 --> 00:47:57,320
thought ignore linear order. There's no linear order there at all. Just abstract structures

319
00:47:57,320 --> 00:48:11,000
created by the mind and somatic interpretations, like the ones for river, house, book, every word

320
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:20,120
you can think of, which are constructed by the mind. So let's take structure, dependence. How

321
00:48:20,120 --> 00:48:31,320
can we account for this? Well, we have to show that when language evolved, it mother nature

322
00:48:31,960 --> 00:48:39,400
hit upon the simplest possible combinatorial operation. The basic property of language,

323
00:48:40,200 --> 00:48:48,120
all languages, is that each language is what you know, what's the knowledge possessed is

324
00:48:48,120 --> 00:48:56,280
an infinite array of sentences, which are structured expressions, hierarchy of structures,

325
00:48:56,920 --> 00:49:05,640
and can somehow be assigned an interpretation as a thought, and by the externalization system

326
00:49:06,280 --> 00:49:12,200
mapped on to the printer sensory motor organs. That's the basic property.

327
00:49:13,160 --> 00:49:21,480
It's property called recursive generation. You have to generate an infinite array of expressions.

328
00:49:22,200 --> 00:49:30,840
Well, the understanding of how to do that developed really in the early part of the 20th

329
00:49:30,840 --> 00:49:40,520
century, as the theory of computation was developed by leading mathematicians, Kurt Gertl,

330
00:49:40,600 --> 00:49:49,320
Alan Turing, Alonzo Church, Emil Post, established the modern theory of computation,

331
00:49:49,960 --> 00:50:00,680
which shows clearly how a finite object like your laptop or your brain can store within it programs

332
00:50:01,320 --> 00:50:11,320
that can yield an infinite array of objects, expressions in our case, and do it in a way

333
00:50:11,320 --> 00:50:19,880
which could be hooked up to a printer. That allows us to ask what are the operations that

334
00:50:19,880 --> 00:50:30,520
mother nature would have hit upon as soon as some accident took place in the evolutionary record

335
00:50:30,760 --> 00:50:37,720
a couple hundred thousand years ago, and the property of recursive generation somehow appeared.

336
00:50:39,080 --> 00:50:45,000
What's the simplest way to deal with it? Well, the simplest computation happens to be

337
00:50:45,960 --> 00:50:53,880
what's called binary set formation, forming a set out of two elements, not changing either of them.

338
00:50:54,840 --> 00:51:01,960
You repeat that over and over again, you get hierarchic structures indefinitely.

339
00:51:03,480 --> 00:51:12,840
So a plausible evolutionary scenario is some accident took place, maybe some small mutation

340
00:51:13,960 --> 00:51:22,760
out of it came. A process of recursive generation mother nature then picked the simplest one,

341
00:51:23,640 --> 00:51:28,200
binary set formation, what's called merge in the recent literature,

342
00:51:28,840 --> 00:51:34,840
and then everything flowed from that. Structure dependence flows from it immediately.

343
00:51:36,280 --> 00:51:43,000
Many other properties do as well, where you can show that that's the case, you have a genuine

344
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:49,240
explanation. Notice incidentally that this is the way evolution works generally.

345
00:51:49,240 --> 00:52:02,360
Evolution goes through all evolution, goes through three, I see a half of the question, but I can't

346
00:52:02,360 --> 00:52:16,360
read it. Okay, could you just hold it for a second, we'll come later. The way evolution works is

347
00:52:17,320 --> 00:52:27,560
three steps. First, some accident takes place, could be a mutation, cosmic ray passed by and

348
00:52:28,280 --> 00:52:37,320
changed the DNA slightly, an accident. It could be what's called symbiosis. So if you go back

349
00:52:38,280 --> 00:52:46,600
a couple hundred million years, it turned out that a bacterium, there were only bacteria and

350
00:52:46,600 --> 00:52:56,200
similar microorganisms at the time, one bacterium by accident swallowed another microorganism

351
00:52:57,400 --> 00:53:03,800
that led to the development of what are called eukaryotic cells, complex cells,

352
00:53:04,520 --> 00:53:14,120
the basis for complex life, our life for example. The third step is winnowing of the various

353
00:53:14,120 --> 00:53:22,440
things constructed in the second step, which ones have better reproductive capacity, that's

354
00:53:22,440 --> 00:53:32,040
natural selection, those are the ones that survive. So it seems to be the way language

355
00:53:32,040 --> 00:53:40,280
developed. First came some accident, maybe a mutation, which yielded recursive generation,

356
00:53:41,080 --> 00:53:48,200
then other nature comes along, tries to find the most elegant solution to the problem of

357
00:53:48,200 --> 00:53:55,720
how to deal with these new systems. In one case it was eukaryotic cells, in our case it was

358
00:53:56,120 --> 00:54:03,960
a generation by merge. The winning stage apparently never came for language,

359
00:54:04,840 --> 00:54:10,840
there's no winnowing stage or what we stayed the same, maybe because time just

360
00:54:12,120 --> 00:54:18,920
hasn't been long enough for natural selection to operate, maybe it's because at the second

361
00:54:19,480 --> 00:54:27,640
elegant stage the system was so closely integrated that you just can't change it or it falls

362
00:54:27,640 --> 00:54:35,880
apart. That would be a very interesting discovery and research is tending in the direction of

363
00:54:35,880 --> 00:54:44,280
showing that it's correct. Well time is running out, let me stop here, we're now reaching what would

364
00:54:44,280 --> 00:54:53,320
be the next chapter. How does all this work out in detail? But I think maybe if this succeeded you

365
00:54:53,320 --> 00:55:01,560
have a general picture of how we can hope to meet the Galilean challenge, the basic challenge in the

366
00:55:02,200 --> 00:55:11,160
history of the study of language in mind and do it in a way which can give genuine explanations

367
00:55:11,160 --> 00:55:19,640
for some quite remarkable properties of language and thought while leaving identifying

368
00:55:19,640 --> 00:55:26,680
other properties as a total mystery which we simply cannot comprehend. That seems to me

369
00:55:26,680 --> 00:55:38,840
pretty much where we stand today, I'll stop there. Thank you Noam, can you hear me okay?

370
00:55:39,800 --> 00:55:46,360
Great, so we'll have actually asked people to raise their hands for questions, I think it

371
00:55:46,360 --> 00:55:51,640
will be easier to moderate them but we did have a couple come in through chat and maybe

372
00:55:52,760 --> 00:55:59,960
we can start there. Leslie Bailey if you want to unmute yourself and ask your question go ahead.

373
00:56:01,560 --> 00:56:08,040
Oh great, okay I'm afraid this is a really really stupid question Noam, I'm sorry. If possible

374
00:56:08,040 --> 00:56:14,680
please restate the difference between the behavioral structural approach to language and

375
00:56:14,680 --> 00:56:20,840
what replaced it and how that transition occurred. I mean I know it's very complicated but if you

376
00:56:20,840 --> 00:56:27,080
could just say it in two sentences. It's quite interesting, let's take a look at how the

377
00:56:27,880 --> 00:56:35,480
structural linguists identified their own theory, their words. Structural linguistics

378
00:56:36,040 --> 00:56:44,200
was identified by mid 20th century, a consensus had been reached among the at that time

379
00:56:44,840 --> 00:56:50,840
fairly small number of structural linguists, it was a very small field then, a huge field now.

380
00:56:51,640 --> 00:56:57,880
The small, they reached the consensus that structural linguistics was what they called

381
00:56:57,880 --> 00:57:07,000
a taxonomic science. There were procedures of analysis, I was actually a student in the late

382
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:14,520
40s studying this. You studied the procedures of analysis, here's what you do when you have an

383
00:57:14,520 --> 00:57:24,040
informant from a say Native American community, here are the procedures you use, of all you have

384
00:57:24,040 --> 00:57:30,120
as a text, here's the procedures of analysis you use, those procedures identify units,

385
00:57:30,760 --> 00:57:36,920
you organize the units, you're done. It's a taxonomic science, fields over.

386
00:57:37,800 --> 00:57:46,040
Okay so it's descriptive. Let me continue. There was also a theory of learning. It was

387
00:57:46,040 --> 00:57:54,440
stated explicitly by Leonard Bloomfield, the leading linguist, American linguist of the

388
00:57:54,440 --> 00:58:02,840
early 20th century. Language in his words is a matter of training and habit. If there's anything

389
00:58:02,840 --> 00:58:11,800
new produced, it's by analogy. Same view in philosophy of language. Take the major figures,

390
00:58:12,760 --> 00:58:22,120
W.E. Quine, Ludwig Wittgenstein, essentially the same. Language is a matter of training,

391
00:58:23,320 --> 00:58:30,440
habit, your Quine, Schenarian, operant conditioning, anything new is analogy.

392
00:58:32,280 --> 00:58:40,360
The new system that developed starting around the 20th century was essentially a return to the

393
00:58:40,360 --> 00:58:48,680
old tradition. We want to find explanations for linguistic phenomena. We want to find out why

394
00:58:48,680 --> 00:58:59,400
they work this way, not the other way. Why do we say the bombing of the cities is a crime, not

395
00:58:59,400 --> 00:59:06,840
or a crime? Essentially the 17th century questions. As soon as you started on that, you had the same

396
00:59:07,800 --> 00:59:14,920
transition that happened in the 17th century from knowing everything to knowing nothing.

397
00:59:15,880 --> 00:59:22,440
As soon as you started asking these questions, turned out you had no answer. Well, I should say

398
00:59:22,440 --> 00:59:30,280
that the entire tradition was totally unknown, completely forgotten, wasn't rediscovered until

399
00:59:30,280 --> 00:59:37,400
the 1960s after much of the ground had already been laid. The structuralist behaviors

400
00:59:38,120 --> 00:59:45,800
era essentially wiped out the history. But the new system that I've been discussing is

401
00:59:46,680 --> 00:59:51,320
essentially picking up from what the tradition was. I don't know if that's

402
00:59:51,960 --> 00:59:56,360
clear enough to answer the question. No, that's great. Thank you so much.

403
00:59:57,080 --> 01:00:03,400
All right, so our next question is from David Dalton. David, I just unmuted you, so you should

404
01:00:03,400 --> 01:00:11,000
be able to ask your question. Listen to our discussion here, and I ask, is not our consideration

405
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:17,960
a little bit Anglo-centric in that English, yes, it has an alphabet of 26 characters,

406
01:00:18,600 --> 01:00:24,520
but if you look at Mandarin, it has an alphabet of 40,000 characters, only 2,000 of which are

407
01:00:24,600 --> 01:00:31,320
stand today. Not to mention that, Mandarin is a tonal language, whereas English is more of a

408
01:00:31,320 --> 01:00:39,880
literal language. And I don't know Mandarin myself, but I just wonder how is it that we can, with such

409
01:00:39,880 --> 01:00:47,320
broad brush strokes, compare all of language in this discussion, I would seem that there would be

410
01:00:47,400 --> 01:00:55,400
quite a bit of difference in the semantics of Mandarin versus English or say German or French.

411
01:00:56,840 --> 01:01:03,560
Well, I think the comment about the alphabet that I made was Galileo. He was, of course,

412
01:01:03,560 --> 01:01:12,680
thinking of Latin and Greek, but the alphabet is a very superficial matter. It's like the printer.

413
01:01:12,680 --> 01:01:20,280
You can use all sorts of alphabets. You can use the Mandarin style, the Korean style,

414
01:01:21,640 --> 01:01:29,800
hieroglyphs, just as you can use any printer. It turns out that the internal system for Mandarin,

415
01:01:30,600 --> 01:01:42,360
for English, for Youkuts, for Paraguay, for Tagalog, the internal systems are very much the same,

416
01:01:42,360 --> 01:01:49,320
maybe identical. Lots of languages are tonal languages, but they function essentially. That's

417
01:01:49,320 --> 01:01:57,880
just a different printer. And I mentioned just one example when I was talking. Languages like

418
01:01:58,600 --> 01:02:08,360
Youkuts is an example where a single word includes the whole sentence. It was thought for a long time

419
01:02:08,360 --> 01:02:14,920
that those languages must be very different. The more we discover, the more we find that

420
01:02:14,920 --> 01:02:22,920
at the internal level, they're the same. The internal means for constructing expressions

421
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:29,640
and the semantics is either identical or very close to it. It doesn't look like that on the

422
01:02:29,640 --> 01:02:36,600
surface. You're quite right. On the surface, they look wildly different. And it was assumed,

423
01:02:36,600 --> 01:02:46,680
if you go back 50 years, it was assumed that languages can differ in just about every possible

424
01:02:46,680 --> 01:02:53,720
way. And when you study a particular language, you can't use any presuppositions from another

425
01:02:53,720 --> 01:03:01,240
language. That was sometimes called the Boazian principle. That's what I learned when I was a

426
01:03:01,240 --> 01:03:10,520
student. It seems to be completely wrong. It seems that at the core, all languages are either

427
01:03:11,080 --> 01:03:18,920
identical or very close to it. The systems that construct internal expressions in the mind,

428
01:03:19,800 --> 01:03:27,720
expressions of thought don't seem to differ. The externalization looks very different.

429
01:03:28,520 --> 01:03:37,640
They seem arranged differently, different sounds, and so on. But all of that seems superficial.

430
01:03:38,360 --> 01:03:47,560
To go back to the analogy of the laptop and the printer, what's the internal program in the laptop

431
01:03:48,520 --> 01:03:55,720
seems pretty close to common for all languages that we know, including very diverse ones.

432
01:03:56,440 --> 01:04:02,680
The printer can be very different. And the alphabet isn't even the printer. It's not the

433
01:04:02,680 --> 01:04:07,960
sounds. It's the representation of the sounds. So it's even more remote from language.

434
01:04:11,320 --> 01:04:15,640
Our next question is from Fran Manley. Fran, if you want to unmute yourself or I've

435
01:04:15,640 --> 01:04:19,880
unmuted you actually, Fran, you're good to go. Yeah, I got a two-part question, professor.

436
01:04:19,880 --> 01:04:24,520
One, is there any evidence as to whether or not other species, for example, like dogs,

437
01:04:25,240 --> 01:04:31,160
have a common language which allows them to communicate even with dogs they don't know?

438
01:04:31,880 --> 01:04:36,440
And my second question, if I may, is on children, I've been led to believe that

439
01:04:36,440 --> 01:04:41,880
children don't use a word unless they've heard it. But I got the impression from what you've said

440
01:04:41,880 --> 01:04:47,080
that's not necessarily so. They don't have to hear a word to learn it. Okay, thank you.

441
01:04:48,280 --> 01:04:54,120
Well, on the second one, children have to hear a word in order to not,

442
01:04:54,120 --> 01:04:59,160
not to, depends on what you mean by learn the word. They know the meaning of the word

443
01:04:59,720 --> 01:05:09,320
before they hear what the sounds are. So if you're a Chinese child, a Pottawatomie child,

444
01:05:10,120 --> 01:05:16,920
French child, whatever it may be, you have the meaning in your head. You don't know what sound

445
01:05:16,920 --> 01:05:23,800
is going to be associated with it. That you have to hear. And Lauderdale Gleitman and

446
01:05:24,520 --> 01:05:30,120
her work and others have shown that takes almost no, no, no experience.

447
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:37,480
Couple here at a couple of times and you say, okay, that's the internal word that I know with

448
01:05:37,480 --> 01:05:43,800
all of its complex meaning. You do have to hear something to know whether it's pronounced cat

449
01:05:43,800 --> 01:05:49,480
or some other way. Okay, how about the animals? Do they have one language, form of language, other

450
01:05:49,480 --> 01:05:59,240
species? Do they have more? Do they have, do like, do animals or do other species have their own

451
01:05:59,240 --> 01:06:07,160
communication? Yeah. So animals, let's say dogs, I happen to have two of them on the desk at the

452
01:06:07,160 --> 01:06:13,560
moment. You heard a couple of them before. Well, I've looked at them pretty carefully.

453
01:06:14,520 --> 01:06:22,840
They were, they have a number of ideas in their heads, maybe a dozen or so.

454
01:06:24,360 --> 01:06:31,160
Sometimes they can do moderately complicated things. Like, I'll give you my favorite example.

455
01:06:31,960 --> 01:06:40,360
There's a big dog and a small dog. If the big dog wants to be taken, I hate to say the words

456
01:06:40,360 --> 01:06:46,200
because unfortunately, she'll hear them, but wants to be extricated to the outdoors,

457
01:06:47,480 --> 01:06:53,960
power phrase, which she doesn't understand. When she wants that, she has a trick to do it.

458
01:06:54,680 --> 01:07:01,320
She takes something away from the small dog and the small dog comes over to us to complain.

459
01:07:02,520 --> 01:07:08,680
And we make the big dog, give it, say a toy, give it back to the small dog, and then she

460
01:07:08,680 --> 01:07:16,920
runs right to the door and expects us to extricate her. Okay. So it's more of a behavior than a

461
01:07:16,920 --> 01:07:26,520
language, right? It's a small number of things. It's an entirely different from human language in

462
01:07:26,520 --> 01:07:34,760
every respect. Every animal that's known, including the closest to us, apes, monkeys,

463
01:07:35,720 --> 01:07:46,040
or have symbols, like take a vervet monkey, which has been studied carefully, has maybe a dozen

464
01:07:46,040 --> 01:07:55,400
calls. Like, if the leaves are fluttering in a tree, the vervet monkey will come out with a sound

465
01:07:56,440 --> 01:08:03,640
which makes all the other monkeys run away and hide. We interpret that as a warning sound.

466
01:08:04,200 --> 01:08:08,920
Maybe there's an eagle in the tree or something. I don't know what the monkey's thinking. But

467
01:08:10,920 --> 01:08:18,120
every, or can make another symbol, which is, we interpret as meaning, I'm hungry. Okay.

468
01:08:19,480 --> 01:08:28,440
The point is that each symbol is keyed explicitly to a physically identifiable entity.

469
01:08:28,440 --> 01:08:37,880
The motion of leaves in a tree, hormonal changes, something like that. Okay. Thank you.

470
01:08:37,880 --> 01:08:45,080
And none of the, none of the human symbols are like that. That's Aristotle's point about house.

471
01:08:45,720 --> 01:08:51,640
So they're radically different. Furthermore, there's no combinatorial structure in the

472
01:08:52,200 --> 01:09:01,240
animal systems. It's just a symbol. Now, there have been major efforts to try to train chimpanzees

473
01:09:02,120 --> 01:09:11,640
like infants. The main study you may have seen, it is called the NIMM study, named after me, actually,

474
01:09:12,440 --> 01:09:19,400
by a number of very fine cognitive scientists, some of them former students. Now, one of them

475
01:09:19,400 --> 01:09:27,720
a colleague and friend, they made an extensive effort to raise the chimpanzee NIMM from infancy

476
01:09:28,920 --> 01:09:39,320
pretty much the way you raise an infant, extensive efforts to get NIMM to pick up something like

477
01:09:39,320 --> 01:09:50,520
language. They used sign because the articulatory system for the chimpanzee doesn't work very well.

478
01:09:51,240 --> 01:09:57,160
So train it like an infant would learn sign. At first, they thought they were getting somewhere,

479
01:09:57,720 --> 01:10:04,280
but when they looked closely, it turned out it was nothing. It's just beyond the capacity

480
01:10:04,920 --> 01:10:12,280
of a highly intelligent ape to do anything like what a one- and two-year-old infant does.

481
01:10:12,280 --> 01:10:18,040
They're just built differently. There are things that other organisms do that we can't do,

482
01:10:18,840 --> 01:10:25,480
like I live in the desert. In the back of my house, there are desert ants who have cognitive

483
01:10:25,480 --> 01:10:33,160
capacities that I can't come close to. They can navigate in ways which I can't possibly do,

484
01:10:33,160 --> 01:10:39,240
maybe humans can duplicate it with complicated instruments, and they have a brain about the size

485
01:10:39,240 --> 01:10:48,280
of a miniscule brain. Organisms are just different. Our difference is we have the capacity for language.

486
01:10:48,840 --> 01:10:52,440
It doesn't have any counterpart anywhere. No.

487
01:10:57,080 --> 01:11:01,640
Our next question is from Les. I've unmuted you, Les, so go ahead and ask.

488
01:11:01,880 --> 01:11:11,000
Yeah, this question is maybe more philosophical, but the idea about thought and expression,

489
01:11:11,880 --> 01:11:21,720
can you have thoughts before expression internally, or do they rise simultaneously and cannot exist independently?

490
01:11:24,520 --> 01:11:31,240
Well, these are things where we can't introspect because it's all beyond the level of

491
01:11:31,240 --> 01:11:38,760
introspection, and there's no external scientific evidence. But the simplest theory,

492
01:11:39,480 --> 01:11:46,360
the simplest assumption, the one that would have to be disproved, is that they're just the same thing.

493
01:11:47,560 --> 01:11:57,080
The expression is the thought. There's an internal system which has provided we all have

494
01:11:57,960 --> 01:12:07,800
the knowledge we possess, includes an infinite array of these thoughts formulated in the linguistic

495
01:12:07,800 --> 01:12:18,440
system. When I produce a sentence, I pick out one of them somehow, how unknown, then I implement it.

496
01:12:18,440 --> 01:12:27,080
So there may be no distinction between thought and expression, no first or second.

497
01:12:28,680 --> 01:12:34,920
Just that's what the thoughts are. There's a repository of thoughts in linguistic form,

498
01:12:35,720 --> 01:12:41,480
and we can then implement them. And on the receptive side, you can reconstruct them.

499
01:12:42,440 --> 01:12:48,920
Maybe not the same way, maybe even in a different language, but something very much like them.

500
01:12:52,280 --> 01:12:56,040
Our next question is Joe Keller. Go ahead, Joe. I've unmuted you.

501
01:12:57,880 --> 01:13:04,440
Thank you, Scott. Professor, as the newly conceived human begins to develop her that

502
01:13:04,440 --> 01:13:11,400
inborn language structure, will her external experiences add to or enhance that structure in

503
01:13:11,400 --> 01:13:20,200
any way? Well, here we ought to pay attention to the way built-in structures work generally

504
01:13:21,400 --> 01:13:27,480
to take your visual system. The visual system does quite complicated things,

505
01:13:28,440 --> 01:13:36,040
very, there's time to talk about them, but very rich things. If your visual system is not

506
01:13:36,840 --> 01:13:45,320
stimulated in the early weeks of life, it'll degenerate. We know this from studies with

507
01:13:45,880 --> 01:13:53,560
other animals, cats, monkeys, and so on, in basis that we live about the same visual system.

508
01:13:54,440 --> 01:14:00,680
It's shown that unless a kitten is presented with pattern stimulation

509
01:14:01,560 --> 01:14:07,800
in the first couple of weeks of life, it'll be blind. That's the way

510
01:14:08,600 --> 01:14:14,920
and all instinctive behavior works like that. It has to be triggered by something,

511
01:14:15,000 --> 01:14:23,640
and then it is partially shaped, partially shaped by the way, by the stimulation.

512
01:14:24,280 --> 01:14:32,440
So it takes kittens again. If kittens are presented in the early weeks of life only with

513
01:14:33,080 --> 01:14:42,440
horizontal lines, then as a mature cat, it'll be able to perceive horizontal lines,

514
01:14:42,440 --> 01:14:48,440
not vertical lines. That's a little bit like different learning, different languages.

515
01:14:49,240 --> 01:14:56,600
You can shape the internal system marginally. You can't train a kitten to recognize

516
01:14:58,120 --> 01:15:03,480
curves, for example, in infancy. It has to be lines and different orientations.

517
01:15:05,160 --> 01:15:12,200
Lots of things can't get it to do, and that's the way instinctive behavior works quite generally.

518
01:15:12,200 --> 01:15:18,600
It seems to be the same with language as far as we know. The system is built in, the internal system

519
01:15:19,560 --> 01:15:28,120
has to be triggered in order to get started, to develop, then pretty much develops on its own

520
01:15:28,120 --> 01:15:36,200
course. There are some respects in which experience outside data shapes the system.

521
01:15:37,080 --> 01:15:45,240
One is the trivial one of how do you pronounce this? Others are, are you going to be like

522
01:15:46,200 --> 01:15:51,960
English, an analytic language with a lot of separate words that form a sentence?

523
01:15:52,680 --> 01:16:00,200
Or are you going to be like, let's say, a language where you have one huge word that

524
01:16:00,200 --> 01:16:10,040
includes everything? Well, that requires some stimulation. A large part of recent research,

525
01:16:10,040 --> 01:16:18,120
very recent research, is to try to sort out which parts are fixed and fundamental,

526
01:16:19,000 --> 01:16:27,640
which parts are provided by the shaping expective experience. It's turned out pretty surprising.

527
01:16:28,440 --> 01:16:38,280
So 40 or 50 years ago, the greatest anthropological linguists, friends of all of us here,

528
01:16:39,160 --> 01:16:45,560
Ken Hale, former teacher's friend, one of the leading anthropological and

529
01:16:46,520 --> 01:16:54,440
formal linguists of the past generation, he firmly believed that languages differed in

530
01:16:55,400 --> 01:17:03,000
what's called a parameter, an option of choices. Some had flat structure with no hierarchy,

531
01:17:03,560 --> 01:17:11,560
some like English had hierarchy. And it looked, that's the way the evidence looked. Over time,

532
01:17:12,200 --> 01:17:21,320
actually Ken, Ken Hale and his students, Julie Legge, were able to show that even the most extreme

533
01:17:21,320 --> 01:17:28,760
cases of languages that looked like completely free word order or flat no structure, even they

534
01:17:28,760 --> 01:17:35,240
had the same internal structure as the hierarchical languages. These are real discoveries, major

535
01:17:35,240 --> 01:17:42,760
discoveries of the past couple of decades. And we don't know how far it'll go, but I think it's

536
01:17:42,760 --> 01:17:50,040
a reasonable guess by now that it'll probably go to showing that the internal system that generates

537
01:17:50,040 --> 01:17:57,640
thought is either uniform or very close to it, and that the apparent variety and complexity

538
01:17:58,360 --> 01:18:04,440
and mutability, the change from generation to generation, all of that's probably in the

539
01:18:04,440 --> 01:18:11,480
externalization and the trivial lexical properties, like do you pronounce it cat or some other way.

540
01:18:11,880 --> 01:18:18,680
Our next question is Miriam Burt. Miriam, you are unmuted, go ahead.

541
01:18:19,480 --> 01:18:24,760
Thank you. I think my question, Professor, probably follows on pretty well to the recent one,

542
01:18:24,760 --> 01:18:32,600
the one you just responded to. You said earlier that around two years to 30 months is this riot,

543
01:18:32,600 --> 01:18:39,880
this wonderful time when, you know, they're learning a new word or a new every waking hours.

544
01:18:39,960 --> 01:18:47,720
But I wonder if a child, if she's deprived of both that visual stimulation and the language,

545
01:18:47,720 --> 01:18:52,680
you know, the auditory to hear the words from, because she's in an orphanage or, you know, in a

546
01:18:52,680 --> 01:19:01,080
very poverty state, if you will, you know, for external stimuli. Will she be able to catch up

547
01:19:01,720 --> 01:19:08,920
if she is subsequently, you know, exposed to this, this stimuli, you know, internally and

548
01:19:08,920 --> 01:19:13,880
externally, I mean, visually and auditorially, or is she always going to be a little behind

549
01:19:13,880 --> 01:19:22,680
and not quite up to what she could be. Thank you. That's a very, it's a very difficult question,

550
01:19:22,680 --> 01:19:33,080
because we cannot do experiments. You don't do experiments with humans. Rightly or wrongly,

551
01:19:33,080 --> 01:19:40,360
we do do them with cats and monkeys. That's how we know about the visual system, which is pretty

552
01:19:40,360 --> 01:19:46,200
much shared with us. Can't do it with any other organism, because no other organism with anything

553
01:19:46,280 --> 01:19:54,520
remotely like language. So we just have to look at the experiences that we see. And they're,

554
01:19:56,200 --> 01:20:03,560
they're very interesting. You learn a lot from them. So there's a very fine neuroscientist

555
01:20:04,520 --> 01:20:13,240
named Helen Neville, Oregon State University, who done fine work on the brain and language.

556
01:20:13,720 --> 01:20:19,560
Actually, about 30 years ago, she got interested in pretty much this question.

557
01:20:20,520 --> 01:20:31,480
She took children who are what are called low SES, socioeconomic status, and who seemed to be

558
01:20:32,040 --> 01:20:37,240
problems in school. They weren't learning. They couldn't speak to all kind of behavioral and

559
01:20:37,240 --> 01:20:44,040
other problems. And she began to study them carefully. She noticed some interesting things.

560
01:20:44,760 --> 01:20:53,160
Their parents don't talk to them. I mean, they say, get out or go outside or leave me alone.

561
01:20:53,160 --> 01:20:59,320
And not because they're bad people, they're just people who are trying to survive on two jobs in

562
01:20:59,320 --> 01:21:05,640
miserable circumstances. Parents never read them stories. You know, they've never had that experience.

563
01:21:06,280 --> 01:21:12,360
So she tried a simple experiment, trying to bring the parents and the children together

564
01:21:13,240 --> 01:21:22,360
and encourage them just in some free time to interact, like have a mother read a story to

565
01:21:22,360 --> 01:21:29,880
the children, things like that. Turned out they enjoyed it. They did more of it. They started

566
01:21:29,960 --> 01:21:35,640
having much higher cognitive achievements. Weren't problems in schools and so on.

567
01:21:37,080 --> 01:21:42,440
Well, that's a partial answer to your question. I'll mention another real experiment,

568
01:21:43,640 --> 01:21:51,400
real event. It's a very fine, another cognitive neuroscientist to come and Massimo know very well.

569
01:21:52,360 --> 01:22:02,280
He lives in Massachusetts. He began working with children who were such extreme behavior problems

570
01:22:02,280 --> 01:22:09,240
that they were basically excluded from school. They couldn't stay in a classroom, had to be

571
01:22:09,240 --> 01:22:17,640
excluded. He started working with them, looking at them carefully. He immediately found out

572
01:22:17,640 --> 01:22:25,000
that these were kids who came from homes where they didn't eat breakfast. They didn't eat breakfast.

573
01:22:25,000 --> 01:22:31,160
They got on a school bus. The bus roamed around for an hour. They finally got to the school.

574
01:22:31,800 --> 01:22:38,200
They were out of their heads. They were sent to maybe an arithmetic class.

575
01:22:39,160 --> 01:22:43,560
Here they couldn't pay any attention. They ran around the room and so on.

576
01:22:44,120 --> 01:22:49,720
Well, he started doing something. For one thing, when they came to school, the first thing he did

577
01:22:49,720 --> 01:22:57,240
was give them candy because their glucose levels were low. They hadn't eaten. Then,

578
01:22:57,240 --> 01:23:03,160
instead of putting them right in an arithmetic class, he let them stay outside and run around

579
01:23:03,160 --> 01:23:10,120
for half an hour. Then they brought them into school. Other things like that. By now, these kids

580
01:23:10,120 --> 01:23:16,440
are performing considerably better than the average in the public school system.

581
01:23:17,560 --> 01:23:25,800
Well, I think that's the kind of evidence that we have about your question. It's a humanly,

582
01:23:25,800 --> 01:23:32,440
very significant question. We can't do direct experiments on it. We're not going to deprive

583
01:23:32,440 --> 01:23:37,880
children and see what happens. You take the natural experiments and see what you can find out.

584
01:23:38,680 --> 01:23:45,320
I think the basic answer is that if the deprivation is not too severe,

585
01:23:46,280 --> 01:23:53,640
the child can probably recover normal cognitive capacity. If the deprivation is extremely

586
01:23:53,640 --> 01:24:00,440
severe and there are such cases, the child is simply deprived of external contact,

587
01:24:01,080 --> 01:24:08,360
maybe a sociopathic father, something like that, then they may never recover.

588
01:24:08,360 --> 01:24:13,480
But it's hard to know what's caused. There's a famous case, Jeanne, which you may have read

589
01:24:13,480 --> 01:24:21,320
about, but it's hard to know what the lack of recovery is from because any kid like that is

590
01:24:21,320 --> 01:24:28,920
going to be psychotic. If you're brought up, tied to a chair till you're 12 years old with somebody

591
01:24:29,000 --> 01:24:35,880
throwing food at you, you're going to be psychotic if you can even survive. So how much is that

592
01:24:35,880 --> 01:24:43,080
interfering with what's happening? Well, we don't know and we don't want to do the experiments,

593
01:24:43,080 --> 01:24:52,360
which will answer it. We've got about five minutes left. Our next question is from Linda Green.

594
01:24:52,360 --> 01:25:01,080
Linda, you are unmuted. Go ahead. My question has to do with brain research.

595
01:25:01,080 --> 01:25:06,600
What contemporary brain research is shedding light on linguistics?

596
01:25:08,520 --> 01:25:16,120
Well, it's difficult because brain research altogether is very difficult and brain research

597
01:25:16,200 --> 01:25:24,040
on humans is particularly difficult because we do not allow invasive experiments.

598
01:25:25,800 --> 01:25:34,360
With a cat, we allow ourselves to stick an electrode into a neuron and see what it's doing.

599
01:25:35,400 --> 01:25:43,080
You don't do that with humans. So it's all kind of evidence you can pick up by external

600
01:25:44,040 --> 01:25:49,960
imaging and so on. And you can learn a great deal. In fact, the most important discovery

601
01:25:50,600 --> 01:25:56,520
about this actually has to do with what I call structure dependence, the fact that

602
01:25:57,480 --> 01:26:06,440
the computational operations of language make no use of 100% of what we hear, words in linear order.

603
01:26:06,520 --> 01:26:09,640
They only deal with abstract structures in the mind.

604
01:26:11,000 --> 01:26:17,240
They're very ingenious experiments initiated by a friend and colleague of ours,

605
01:26:17,880 --> 01:26:27,880
Andrea Moro, Italian linguist, neuroscientist. He and his colleagues devised experiments on

606
01:26:27,880 --> 01:26:37,480
the following paradigm. They took subjects, two groups of subjects who happened to be

607
01:26:37,480 --> 01:26:47,240
speakers of German and presented them with invented systems. One of them modeled on

608
01:26:49,160 --> 01:26:56,840
Japanese language that they'd never heard. Another, using simple rules which violated

609
01:26:56,840 --> 01:27:05,960
structure dependency. So a rule that says, if you want to negate a sentence, take the negative

610
01:27:05,960 --> 01:27:12,600
particle, say not, and make it the third word of the sentence. Very trivial computation.

611
01:27:13,720 --> 01:27:20,040
They asked how subjects responded to this. Well, it turned out that when they were given a language

612
01:27:20,760 --> 01:27:30,520
modeled on a natural language, the areas of the brain that are mostly involved in language

613
01:27:30,520 --> 01:27:38,120
processing and use all fired up the way you'd expect them to. When they were given the system,

614
01:27:39,160 --> 01:27:47,080
the artificial system with simple computations on linear order, they just got diffuse activity

615
01:27:47,080 --> 01:27:55,080
in the brain, meaning the brain is treating it as a puzzle, not a language. That's quite an

616
01:27:55,080 --> 01:28:01,400
interesting result, certain replicated, there's different variants of it and so on. But that's

617
01:28:01,400 --> 01:28:08,600
the kind of thing that can be done. There are other, there is other experimental work in

618
01:28:08,600 --> 01:28:16,920
neuro linguistics which shows a number of things. All right, we probably have one quick

619
01:28:16,920 --> 01:28:22,360
question, Ralph Losty, if you'd like to, I've got you on muted Ralph, if you'd like to ask your

620
01:28:22,360 --> 01:28:30,760
question. Yes, I just read recently about the multi-language brain. And it looks like people

621
01:28:30,760 --> 01:28:41,240
with multi-language capabilities are actually perform worse than mono-language brain. And how

622
01:28:41,240 --> 01:28:48,040
could that be when you said the languages are the universe? So the thoughts of being universal

623
01:28:48,840 --> 01:28:57,000
and they should express, okay. Well, first, I don't know what you saw, but I don't believe it.

624
01:28:57,960 --> 01:29:06,840
Every child is easily capable of learning many languages in infancy. It's very common in many

625
01:29:06,840 --> 01:29:14,040
cultures for a child to know three or four languages. They don't even know their different

626
01:29:14,040 --> 01:29:19,560
languages. This is the way you talk to your mother, this is the way you talk to your grandfather,

627
01:29:20,280 --> 01:29:26,280
this is the way you talk to the kids in the street. Finally, at some age, maybe four or five,

628
01:29:26,280 --> 01:29:33,160
they may realize, hey, I'm speaking different languages. But it's just normal. As far as we

629
01:29:33,160 --> 01:29:41,400
know, every child can do that. There's no known difference between, there's no even any way of

630
01:29:41,400 --> 01:29:50,280
studying it, because all children have this multi-language capacity. But I'd be very skeptical

631
01:29:50,280 --> 01:29:58,040
about the source you looked at, frankly. Thank you so much. Well, I think that's all the time we

632
01:29:58,040 --> 01:30:05,160
have today that Professor Chomsky, we really appreciate having you present to us. And I'm

633
01:30:05,160 --> 01:30:09,560
grateful to know as I, when I was a child, and I probably begged for a candy for breakfast that

634
01:30:09,560 --> 01:30:17,960
it wasn't a bad thing. But no, I, we really appreciate you being here. And again, thank the

635
01:30:17,960 --> 01:30:24,120
Department of Linguistics at the University of Arizona for hosting this session and course,

636
01:30:24,120 --> 01:30:28,280
and appreciate it so much. Do you have any other parting words for us, sir?

637
01:30:31,080 --> 01:30:36,520
I hope some of you will be interested enough to look into the meat of the subject,

638
01:30:36,520 --> 01:30:44,120
how it's actually done next chapter. We did have a few people inquiring about

639
01:30:45,080 --> 01:30:50,360
the publications and things that would be of good service to kind of get a general

640
01:30:50,360 --> 01:30:53,400
understanding of this area of study. What are your recommendations?

641
01:30:55,720 --> 01:31:04,040
Well, I have a book called What Kind of Creatures Are We, which goes into many of these questions.

642
01:31:04,280 --> 01:31:11,800
But there's a lot more work. They're very, I should say, they're excellent general introductions

643
01:31:12,360 --> 01:31:22,680
to language. There's a book by Charles Yang called The Infinite Gift, which

644
01:31:24,120 --> 01:31:30,680
focuses a lot on acquisition, but brings up these things. There's a recent book by

645
01:31:31,400 --> 01:31:40,120
David Adger, A-D-G-E-R. I think it's called something like The Infinite Mind or something

646
01:31:40,120 --> 01:31:46,920
like that, which is an excellent introductory discussion at a high level to many of us.

647
01:31:49,240 --> 01:31:56,760
There's a very fine general introduction to many aspects of language by an outstanding

648
01:31:56,760 --> 01:32:05,400
linguist, Ian Roberts. It's called The Wonders of Language, which goes into these and many other

649
01:32:05,400 --> 01:32:14,360
things. There's a lot of very high-level introductory literature for syntax, the kind

650
01:32:14,360 --> 01:32:21,880
of thing I'm talking about. Our colleague here, Andrew Carney, has a book simply called Syntax,

651
01:32:21,880 --> 01:32:29,400
which goes into many of these things in a very lucid way, but in considerable detail.

652
01:32:32,520 --> 01:32:39,960
Well, thank you again so much. We really appreciate it. I can't unmute everybody apparently.

653
01:32:39,960 --> 01:32:51,640
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you so much. Absolutely outstanding. Thank you so much.

654
01:32:53,240 --> 01:33:03,160
Thank you, Professor. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, fabulous. Thank you.

655
01:33:09,960 --> 01:33:13,160
Thank you.
