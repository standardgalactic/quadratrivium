00:00.000 --> 00:18.120
All right, well, Noam Chomsky, I think it's time for me to turn this over to you.

00:18.120 --> 00:25.640
I really want to give you a great big welcome from OliU of A and appreciate your coming today

00:25.640 --> 00:31.800
and presenting to our organization and we're truly an honor and a privilege to have you

00:31.800 --> 00:38.520
with us and I know that a number of emails have gone out and I don't think any introduction

00:38.520 --> 00:48.160
is honestly needed because but can you hear me thank you for joining us and I'll let you

00:48.160 --> 00:49.680
take it over.

00:49.680 --> 00:59.920
Okay, thank you very much. I'd like to have a few words about the maker of language,

00:59.920 --> 01:11.200
its acquisition, origins, its use and so far as we understand these matters today and I'd like to

01:11.200 --> 01:22.040
approach this within the broader context of the inquiry into language and mind which are

01:22.040 --> 01:32.640
the distinctive properties of the human species. Well, good place to start is at the beginning of

01:32.640 --> 01:43.000
their historical records, classical Greece, the Delphic Oracle, which produced the maxim,

01:43.000 --> 01:58.040
know thyself. Well, two word aphorism is open to many interpretations. The intended

01:58.040 --> 02:08.760
interpretation was individual, you the individual should know yourself and unexamined life is not

02:08.760 --> 02:18.360
worth living, the platonic expansion of this, but it makes good sense to understand the maxim of

02:18.360 --> 02:29.040
the oracle collectively, know ourselves. The reason is that we're pretty much similar. It's a

02:29.040 --> 02:39.680
very young species. Humans have only been around for two to 300,000 years. That's early in eye

02:39.680 --> 02:51.440
blink and evolutionary time. It's been mentioned by evolutionary biologists, partly as a joke,

02:51.440 --> 03:01.840
partly real, that if you see two squirrels in a tree outside your window, they very likely are

03:01.920 --> 03:12.920
more diverse genetically than all of the humans in the world. Humans have arisen within a very

03:12.920 --> 03:22.200
narrow window of evolutionary time and they have unique properties. One of these properties is

03:22.520 --> 03:31.480
human language. There's no analog, no similar properties anywhere in the organic world.

03:31.480 --> 03:42.320
Furthermore, it's a species property. It's not only unique to humans, but uniform among humans.

03:43.280 --> 03:54.160
It means that any infant can acquire any language with equal facility, as far as we know. So it's

03:54.160 --> 04:04.200
a species property, virtually definitive of humans. There is another one thought, at least thought in

04:04.840 --> 04:14.440
any form that we can grasp and understand. The kind of thought that made it possible to produce the

04:14.440 --> 04:24.200
maxim of the oracle, to interpret it, to reflect on its significance, myriad other mental activities

04:24.360 --> 04:38.280
that occupy us all day, even in sleep, just again a common human property, totally unique to humans.

04:39.160 --> 04:48.040
Well, when you have two unique species properties, it makes good sense to ask what relation holds

04:48.040 --> 04:56.760
between them. The simplest relation would be simply identity. Language constructs thought.

04:57.640 --> 05:04.600
Thought is what is constructed by language and that is the conclusion that was reached

05:05.560 --> 05:16.360
2,500 years ago, classical India, classical Greece, and it's a tradition that runs through millennia.

05:17.560 --> 05:27.000
Late 19th century, a great American linguist, William Whitney, simply defined language as

05:27.000 --> 05:34.600
audible thought, basically thought, which we happen to externalize through the mouth,

05:35.560 --> 05:42.920
pick up through the ear. We now know that that's too narrow. You can use any other sensory motor

05:42.920 --> 05:52.360
system. So if I don't know if this is being translated into sign, but if it is, you would be

05:52.360 --> 05:59.400
seeing the same thing in sign language, which works very much the same as spoken language,

05:59.960 --> 06:07.000
in the way it's acquired structure, the way it's used down to small details,

06:07.640 --> 06:15.160
even the way it's norally stored. Well, you can think of the language as being

06:16.040 --> 06:24.760
kind of like a program that's in your laptop. So suppose you have a program in your laptop,

06:24.760 --> 06:33.400
calculator, or say, multiplying numbers. The program works by itself. You can attach it to a

06:33.400 --> 06:44.520
printer, could be a printer that uses colors, dark letters, and one font, another font. The program

06:44.600 --> 06:54.200
doesn't care. It can be hooked up to, sorry, try to be louder. It can be hooked up, is this any better?

06:55.400 --> 07:03.880
Can be hooked up to any printer that you want. The program stays the same. And language seems

07:03.880 --> 07:11.880
very much like that. There's an internal system constructing thoughts. It can be hooked up to

07:11.880 --> 07:20.440
one sensory motor system or another to externalize it. But the program seemed to be the same.

07:21.480 --> 07:28.280
Well, let me make a side comment here on the history and then return to the

07:28.920 --> 07:37.240
mainstream of the discussion. What I've just been describing is basically the long millennial,

07:37.240 --> 07:44.600
long tradition of the study of language in mind that goes right into the 20th century.

07:45.880 --> 07:56.840
Early 20th century had changed. The general view in the early 20th century still largely surviving

07:57.480 --> 08:05.160
is that language is not primarily an instrument, the means of thought, but rather it's a system

08:05.160 --> 08:16.600
of communication. That's sort of the mantra today in philosophy of language, much of linguistics,

08:16.600 --> 08:26.600
cognitive science. This, I think, is a result of the rise of behaviorism in the 20th century,

08:27.480 --> 08:39.400
which drove scientists, philosophers, others to look at what's visible, what's apparent,

08:39.400 --> 08:47.160
behavior, to keep away from hidden things like what's going on in your mind. That was a very

08:47.160 --> 08:54.600
sharp departure from the scientific tradition. It's very anti-scientific in my view. It became

08:55.560 --> 09:01.560
quite dominant, especially in the first half of the 20th century. There's also a kind of a

09:02.280 --> 09:09.160
primitive version of Darwinism, which does have its roots in Darwin's writings,

09:09.880 --> 09:18.840
the idea that all changes through evolution must be small changes, which operate through

09:19.480 --> 09:28.280
natural selection and over time may give large-scale differences. It's now known that that's

09:28.280 --> 09:39.080
completely false, but the residue of that does lead you to the belief, the illusion in my view,

09:39.720 --> 09:46.920
that language somehow must have emerged from simpler systems, going back to

09:47.000 --> 09:53.800
animal communication. The evidence is strongly against that, and there's nothing in

09:53.800 --> 10:00.120
evolutionary biology that leads to such conclusions. Actually, this is,

10:01.480 --> 10:11.080
notice that this behaviorist turn is a turn away from the effort to understand and explain

10:11.960 --> 10:21.240
in effort to describe basically what you see in Silicon Valley linguistics, the kind that makes

10:21.240 --> 10:29.640
the headlines about the things that it's claimed that machines can do. Associated with this was

10:30.600 --> 10:36.760
conception of how language is acquired, dominant conception, philosophy of language,

10:37.480 --> 10:45.160
linguistics, language is acquired through training and instituting habits,

10:45.880 --> 10:53.800
if there's anything new that's said by analogy, all completely wrong, completely reshuted,

10:53.800 --> 11:00.440
still very common. Well, let's go back to the tradition, which I think was on the right course.

11:01.400 --> 11:10.200
The study of language took a large step forward with the 17th century scientific revolution.

11:11.240 --> 11:20.360
The primary lesson of the scientific revolution was that you should be puzzled by simple things

11:20.360 --> 11:29.640
that you take for granted. So, a heavy ball of lid plainly falls faster than a light one.

11:30.520 --> 11:38.360
Except that it doesn't, as Galileo showed with elegant thought experiments,

11:39.720 --> 11:48.840
take a sailboat moving through the sea. I suppose there's a lid ball on the top of the mast.

11:50.200 --> 11:58.920
If it falls, it should fall behind the mast. Of course, the sailboat is moving forward, except

11:58.920 --> 12:07.960
that it doesn't fall to the base of the mast. Again, Galileo showed this with thought experiments.

12:08.520 --> 12:15.240
If he'd done an actual experiment, the results would have been all over the place. But as in

12:15.880 --> 12:25.080
much of science, then and since, the idea was to construct ideal situations, often by thought,

12:25.720 --> 12:35.160
sometimes by careful experiment, if you can, that bring out the hidden reality between behind the

12:36.280 --> 12:44.760
phenomena that you see, which are always complex. Many variables can't be studied. That's why

12:44.760 --> 12:52.120
scientists do experiments. Well, if you go back to scholastic science in the 16th century,

12:52.920 --> 13:01.720
what Galileo and his contemporaries were struggling against, scholastic science had answers to

13:01.720 --> 13:10.040
everything. If a ball falls to the ground and steam rises, it's because they're going to their

13:10.040 --> 13:19.240
natural place. If two objects attract or repel each other, it's because they have sympathies

13:19.240 --> 13:27.560
and antipathies. If you perceive a triangle, it's because the form of the triangle

13:29.320 --> 13:34.760
passes through the air and implants itself in your brain. So there was an answer to everything.

13:35.960 --> 13:43.880
All the answers were wrong. They were based on what modern science called occult qualities,

13:44.600 --> 13:53.240
invented concepts that don't exist, and the willingness to be puzzled by things opened the

13:53.240 --> 14:01.800
door to the new science, the science of the last several hundred years. The scholastic science

14:01.800 --> 14:10.600
had answers to everything. The new science had no answers to anything. That's how serious inquiry

14:10.680 --> 14:18.360
begins. And the same has been true of the study of language in the last 60 or 70 years,

14:19.320 --> 14:26.200
breaking with the behaviorist, structuralist tradition. Well, let's take a look at language.

14:27.000 --> 14:34.680
There are simple things that we take for granted. We talk to each other. We understand each other.

14:35.560 --> 14:43.880
What could be simpler than that? Well, to the new scientists, Galileo and his contemporaries,

14:44.600 --> 14:51.880
this seemed an extraordinary puzzle. Amazing. How can it be that with just

14:52.920 --> 15:00.040
a few symbols we can produce, we can construct in our minds infinitely many thoughts,

15:00.920 --> 15:07.400
never before expressed, never in the history of the language, and we can even

15:08.920 --> 15:17.480
convey to others who have no access to our minds, we can convey to them the innermost

15:17.480 --> 15:26.200
working of our minds. They regarded this as an amazing phenomenon. In fact, Galileo himself

15:26.200 --> 15:35.080
regarded the alphabet as the most spectacular of human inventions because it facilitated this

15:35.080 --> 15:49.400
astonishing quality. And it is indeed a remarkable fact. It's been repeated by others. One famous case

15:49.400 --> 15:59.560
is Gottlob Frege a couple of centuries later, the founder of modern logic and logical philosophy

16:00.360 --> 16:08.920
mid-19th century. He wrote that, I'm quoting him, he found it astonishing what language

16:08.920 --> 16:17.560
accomplishes. With a few syllables, it expresses a countless number of thoughts and even for a

16:17.560 --> 16:26.040
thought grasped for the first time by a human, it provides a clothing in which it can be recognized

16:26.040 --> 16:37.000
by another to whom it is entirely new. It's essentially Galileo's insight. And it raises

16:37.080 --> 16:51.080
very deep questions. How can this possibly be the case? This initiated a rich study of what

16:51.080 --> 16:58.920
centuries study of what was called universal and rational grammar. Universal because it tried to

16:58.920 --> 17:06.600
cover all languages. Rational because it was interested in explanation and not description.

17:07.560 --> 17:15.400
Very different from the structural linguistics and philosophy of language of the first half

17:15.400 --> 17:24.680
of the 20th century, which described itself as a taxonomic science. We have procedures of analysis

17:25.400 --> 17:35.000
you can apply them to data that you come up with an organization of the data. It's basically today's

17:35.000 --> 17:41.640
Silicon Valley. That's doesn't care about understanding, doesn't care about explanation,

17:41.640 --> 17:51.320
just organization of data. A radical change from traditional science, including the science of

17:51.320 --> 18:01.480
language. Again, the old tradition was picked up, revived around mid 20th century. Well,

18:02.120 --> 18:11.400
it does raise the problems for Descartes in the 17th century. It was the basis for his establishment

18:11.400 --> 18:23.560
of the classical mind body problem. Descartes accepted the basic idea of the new science, Galileo,

18:24.680 --> 18:31.800
Royal Society in England, later Newton, others that the world is basically a machine,

18:32.680 --> 18:40.840
a complex machine, the kind of machine that could be built in principle by a skilled artisan,

18:41.640 --> 18:49.640
and that in their theology in fact was created by a super skilled artisan. Machine means something

18:50.440 --> 18:58.760
built out of gears and levers and pulleys and so on. That's the world. But Descartes recognized

18:59.320 --> 19:08.840
that there are certain things that didn't seem to fall within machine science, what was called at

19:08.840 --> 19:16.440
the time mechanical philosophy. Philosophy meant science. So there were things that didn't fall

19:16.440 --> 19:27.480
within it. One of the most striking ones Descartes felt correctly is the creative aspect of language

19:27.480 --> 19:37.960
use. What amazed Galileo, his contemporaries centuries later, Freda, how is this possible

19:38.600 --> 19:46.680
for a machine? It is impossible for a machine. And that led Descartes, a sensible scientist,

19:47.240 --> 19:56.120
to postulate a new principle, a thinking principle, mind. That's the mind body problem.

19:57.160 --> 20:05.960
Next task for Descartes and other sciences was to see how they're unified. Well, I quickly

20:07.320 --> 20:13.320
ran into, sorry, somebody's at the door, my dogs are unhappy about it.

20:14.280 --> 20:28.840
This collapsed pretty quickly. Isaac Newton's great discovery was that the world is not a machine.

20:29.640 --> 20:36.360
There are no machines. There are no bodies in the sense, any sense of body that we have.

20:37.080 --> 20:44.840
The world is just not intelligible to us. That was the criterion of intelligibility.

20:46.200 --> 20:56.280
John Locke immediately recognized that, as he put it within his theological framework,

20:57.160 --> 21:06.280
just as God has attributed to whatever exists, properties that we cannot conceive,

21:07.000 --> 21:15.160
like interaction without contact. So God may have super added to whatever there is,

21:15.720 --> 21:23.480
the property of thought. Thought is just a property of organized matter, whatever matter,

21:23.480 --> 21:35.080
turns out to be. All of this was worked out extensively through the 18th century,

21:35.960 --> 21:44.840
then forgotten, totally forgotten, revived in the mid 20th century. It's now become

21:45.800 --> 21:55.080
a standard idea after a long period of neglect. Well, that leaves us with serious mysteries.

21:55.960 --> 22:03.960
How is all of this possible? And the answer to that question is, we don't know. We do not know

22:04.600 --> 22:13.720
how it is possible to answer Galileo, how it is possible for or frigate with a small number of

22:13.720 --> 22:24.440
symbols to construct new thoughts, new to us, maybe new in history, to somehow transmit them

22:24.440 --> 22:32.280
to others in such a way that they can interpret the inner workings of our minds. A lot of this is

22:32.840 --> 22:41.640
just unintelligible to us. Well, there are parts of it that we can understand.

22:41.880 --> 22:48.360
Here, we have to make a distinction, which was actually discussed by Aristotle,

22:48.360 --> 22:56.760
but then forgotten until the 20th century. The distinction is between possession of knowledge

22:56.760 --> 23:05.720
and use of knowledge. It's a crucial distinction in modern technical terminology. For those of

23:06.680 --> 23:13.320
you familiar with that, that's the distinction between what's called competence and performance,

23:14.040 --> 23:26.760
what we know and what we use. The internal language provides us with a store of an infinite

23:26.840 --> 23:38.440
number of possible thoughts. That's our possession of knowledge. Our use of knowledge is perception

23:38.440 --> 23:49.160
and production. When you perceive the noises that I'm making, you are accessing your internal store

23:49.160 --> 23:56.840
of knowledge to provide an interpretation for these noises that you're hearing. When I produce a

23:56.840 --> 24:06.440
sentence, I'm carrying out two acts. The first act is selecting a thought from the store of

24:06.440 --> 24:16.120
possible thoughts. The second act is implementing it using the various mechanisms of my mind,

24:16.120 --> 24:24.840
my articulatory system to externalize that internal thought. The second part of it,

24:24.840 --> 24:31.640
we can study and understand. The first part of it, selecting the thought, is completely

24:31.640 --> 24:39.240
beyond our understanding. We have no idea how this takes place. It's part of the general mystery of

24:39.960 --> 24:50.840
voluntary action, which is basically to us an impenetrable mystery. Well, just keeping to what

24:50.840 --> 25:00.200
we can hope to understand, the system of language that constructs thoughts, the formation of the

25:00.200 --> 25:09.800
internal language, keeping to that, we can discover some quite remarkable properties.

25:10.920 --> 25:19.080
Following the tradition of early modern science, let's take simple cases. Take the sentence,

25:19.480 --> 25:30.680
the bombing of the cities is a crime. Notice it's is a crime, not are a crime. Actually,

25:30.680 --> 25:37.960
that's puzzling when you think about it. Why doesn't the verb is agree with the closest

25:37.960 --> 25:46.360
noun phrase? The closest noun phrase is cities. So why don't we say the bombing of the cities

25:46.360 --> 25:57.240
are a crime? Okay, let's take the bombings of the city is a crime, or a crime, the bombings of the

25:57.240 --> 26:06.440
city are a crime. Why don't we say the bombings of the city is a crime? Again, just using the

26:06.440 --> 26:13.240
simple problem for property of adjacency. When you look at it, you see that what humans are doing

26:14.200 --> 26:26.440
is ignoring the simplest possible computational procedure, adjacency, and instead using a complex

26:26.440 --> 26:34.520
procedure, finding, not looking just at the linear order of words, but finding a structure,

26:34.520 --> 26:41.720
and then finding the central element within that structure. It turns out to be pretty complicated

26:41.720 --> 26:49.720
computation. But that's what we do reflexively. And in fact, that's what every infant does.

26:50.600 --> 26:59.480
You can show by experiment that this is what infants do down to before the age of two 30 months

26:59.480 --> 27:07.080
of age can't obviously can. And this is true of all constructions in all languages.

27:08.040 --> 27:14.040
Just to give another example, a little more complicated, take the sentence,

27:16.280 --> 27:27.160
the man who fixed the car carefully packed his tools. The man who fixed the car carefully

27:27.160 --> 27:34.360
packed his tools. Notice it's ambiguous. He could fix the car carefully, or he could carefully

27:34.360 --> 27:43.640
pack his tools. Now put the adverb carefully in the front of the sentence. Carefully, the man who

27:43.640 --> 27:53.640
fixed the car packed his tools. Unambiguous. It means carefully packed his tools. And it's

27:53.640 --> 28:00.840
unambiguous in a puzzling way. Carefully looks for a verb, but it doesn't look for the closest

28:00.840 --> 28:08.520
verb. It looks for the more remote one, which if you build up the structure is the structurally

28:08.520 --> 28:16.760
closest one. So what you're doing is what everyone is doing reflexively is ignoring

28:18.120 --> 28:26.840
the linear order of words and attending only to structures that you never hear and that your

28:26.840 --> 28:36.200
mind creates. Give one last example, take the sentence, the man who saw Bill is young.

28:37.880 --> 28:48.280
Suppose I didn't hear the word Bill clearly. I say, I want to ask who it is. So I say, who is the man

28:48.280 --> 29:00.280
who saw young? Jibberish. Can't say that. Fine thought. You can't say it. You have to, you can only

29:01.880 --> 29:11.640
say you can't use the simplest computational procedure and find the closest occurrence of who

29:12.200 --> 29:21.000
and put it in the front. Splock. Well, this is universal. As I say, children of 30 months old

29:21.000 --> 29:29.160
know it, all constructions, all languages. What it means is the infant, all infants,

29:29.160 --> 29:37.720
are ignoring 100% of what they hear, which is words in linear order. They're ignoring

29:38.360 --> 29:47.480
very simple computations on linear order and they are reflexively paying attention to something

29:47.480 --> 29:55.240
they never hear that their minds create and using computations on those abstract structures.

29:56.120 --> 30:02.840
It's a pretty remarkable fact when you think about it and that is the kind of thing we discover

30:03.560 --> 30:12.840
as soon as you try to answer the Galilean challenge. This property is called structure

30:12.840 --> 30:19.480
dependence in the technical literature. Pretty much the same as true of learning of words.

30:20.440 --> 30:30.600
There is a myth, standard myth, that the way children learn words is they see a cat. Their

30:30.600 --> 30:39.240
mother says cat. They make an association between the thing they see and the sound your mother produced

30:39.240 --> 30:46.520
and this is repeated over and over again in many circumstances, different situations. Finally,

30:46.520 --> 30:55.160
the kid figures out that the sound cat goes along with that feline object. Totally false.

30:55.880 --> 31:01.640
Nothing like that happens. There's a very careful experimentation on this by now.

31:03.480 --> 31:12.120
Primary research and this is wonderful scientist, Lila Gleitman, who old friend passed away a couple

31:12.120 --> 31:22.120
of weeks ago. What Lila Gleitman showed in her experiments is that children pick up words and

31:22.120 --> 31:32.760
the meaning of words on one or two presentations. At the peak period of language learning,

31:33.400 --> 31:41.080
around two years old, children are picking up words at about one every waking hour,

31:41.800 --> 31:48.760
which means that they hear them once, maybe twice. They usually don't pay attention to

31:48.760 --> 31:54.280
their mothers, just whatever is going on in the circumstances and they know the meanings of the

31:54.280 --> 32:02.520
words. The meaning of the word, when you look at it, is very complex. No time to go into this,

32:02.520 --> 32:09.720
but when you really look at the meanings of words, you find out that they are quite rich.

32:09.720 --> 32:17.080
Well, actually, let me mention a few examples from classical Greece where this matter was discussed.

32:18.040 --> 32:27.160
So, take Aristotle again. He took us as an example, the word house. He said,

32:27.800 --> 32:36.040
what is a house? What's the meaning of the word house? And he said, well, it has two components.

32:37.000 --> 32:46.120
One is what he called matter. It's the bricks, the timbers, the physical things that the

32:46.760 --> 32:53.320
house is made up of. The other is what he called form, an idea in the mind.

32:54.680 --> 33:02.360
The characteristic way the object is used, the thought in the mind of the architect who

33:02.360 --> 33:09.480
constructed the way we conceive of it. So, something could look exactly like a house,

33:10.600 --> 33:18.120
physically, but it could be a library, if that's the way it's used. It could be a garage,

33:19.080 --> 33:25.240
could be a stable, could actually be a paperweight for a giant, could be whatever

33:25.640 --> 33:32.840
we conceive of it, whatever the architect has in mind. That is a consequence, and that's quite correct.

33:33.720 --> 33:41.400
That means that a physicist looking at the object couldn't know the meaning of the word.

33:42.600 --> 33:49.960
That means that the child, when it's learning the meaning of the word, is using all of this

33:50.600 --> 34:00.040
intricate understanding in the mind, none of it presented as evidence. Furthermore, that's true

34:00.040 --> 34:07.560
of every word in the language. Let's take an earlier example, pre-socratic, heraclitus,

34:08.520 --> 34:14.280
ask a rather profound question. How can you cross the same river twice?

34:14.920 --> 34:22.040
The second time you cross it, it's a physically different object. In fact, it could be radically

34:22.040 --> 34:32.360
different. It could be flowing in the opposite direction. It could be not water, but arsenic

34:32.440 --> 34:46.200
from an upstream plant. It could have been divided into several trihitoris. It could be like the

34:46.200 --> 34:54.200
river I pass on the way to work here in Tucson, where I live, the Rolito River, which never has

34:54.200 --> 35:01.400
any water in it. It's a dry bed, but it's the Rolito River, because every once in a while you

35:01.400 --> 35:08.600
get a trickle of water through it. Historically, it was a river. It's a river. It's all the way

35:08.600 --> 35:18.040
we conceive it. You could take the Rolito River, start using it for commuting to Tucson. It would

35:18.040 --> 35:26.280
be a highway, not the river. Physically, it hasn't changed at all. That's, again, true of all the

35:26.280 --> 35:34.840
words in our vocabulary. One special case of it is called polysomy. I suppose I say

35:38.360 --> 35:49.480
the book is harder to understand than it is to burn. What's the book? It's simultaneously

35:50.280 --> 35:57.160
abstract, because you can understand it and concrete, because you can burn it. The world

35:57.160 --> 36:03.880
doesn't contain objects that are both concrete and abstract, but our mind constructs them.

36:04.840 --> 36:11.480
And that's what the words of language are. And these are learned virtually without experience.

36:12.440 --> 36:19.320
Another, this one is a real mystery. We don't know how that's done, but it's a fact that has to be

36:19.320 --> 36:27.080
explained. Well, these are among the amazing things that you discover as soon as you begin

36:27.080 --> 36:36.520
to look at the facts closely. One conclusion we have to draw is that language, what we call

36:36.520 --> 36:46.040
language, has two completely separate components. One of them is an internal language that constructs

36:46.040 --> 36:55.640
thoughts, has no order, no linear order, just abstract structures. The second part is a system

36:55.640 --> 37:04.680
that externalizes it into one or another sensory motor, medium, usually sound, could be sign,

37:05.240 --> 37:15.320
could even be touch. Notice that that second component is an amalgam of language and sensory

37:15.640 --> 37:22.600
motor systems. It's not pure language. Sensory motor systems have nothing to do with language.

37:23.320 --> 37:30.200
They were in place long before language emerged. They have not changed since language was

37:31.160 --> 37:38.440
emerged in the evolutionary record. So there's something extraneous to language,

37:39.160 --> 37:47.720
kind of like the printer that your laptop could be attached to. Well, and that of course has

37:47.720 --> 38:00.120
linear order and does use adjacency and other things. Well, when you try to find explanations

38:00.120 --> 38:13.000
for language, you, real explanations, you face a kind of conundrum. A trial learns language with

38:13.800 --> 38:21.880
virtually no evidence. Actual statistical studies of the data available to children

38:21.880 --> 38:30.040
show that it's very sparse, very little. And as I mentioned, they know things for which they have

38:30.040 --> 38:37.800
no evidence at all, like structure dependence. So that makes it seem as though what's innate,

38:37.800 --> 38:47.080
internal to the mind, must be very rich in order to carry the child from extremely limited data

38:47.720 --> 38:56.440
to very rich possession of knowledge. So on the one hand, the learning, the internal structure

38:56.440 --> 39:04.920
must be very rich. But then there's another problem. This system had to evolve. Well,

39:06.280 --> 39:16.520
it evolved in a very brief period of time. We now know from genomic analysis that human beings began

39:16.520 --> 39:27.240
to separate at least 150,000 years ago. And they all have the same faculty of language,

39:27.880 --> 39:34.840
same possession of knowledge, of language, same possession of knowledge. So it was in place

39:35.560 --> 39:43.800
before 150,000 years ago. Well, that's not long after humans emerged. As I said, humans emerge

39:44.520 --> 39:51.640
maybe 200,000 to 300,000 years ago. That's a very narrow window in evolutionary time.

39:54.600 --> 40:02.920
Click up an eye. Before humans emerged, there's no evidence in the archaeological record

40:03.480 --> 40:12.680
for any kind of symbolic activity. After humans emerged pretty soon in evolutionary time,

40:12.680 --> 40:21.960
you had very rich symbolic activity. Ordinarily assume plausibly that this is associated with the

40:21.960 --> 40:28.840
emergence of language. Well, what that seems to mean is that the basic

40:29.880 --> 40:38.440
faculty of language must be quite simple since it emerged so quickly in evolutionary time.

40:39.320 --> 40:48.360
But now we have a conundrum looking at acquisition. Looks like the internal innate system must be

40:48.360 --> 40:58.680
very rich. Looking at evolution seems like it must be very simple. I should say the first problem

40:58.680 --> 41:05.240
acquisition is sometimes called Plato's problem. Plato did raise the question,

41:05.960 --> 41:13.560
how can we know so much with so little evidence? Didn't really have an answer.

41:15.880 --> 41:23.960
The second question is sometimes called Darwin's problem. How could we evolve such a system

41:23.960 --> 41:32.520
so quickly? So it must be both very complex and very simple. There's a third problem,

41:33.080 --> 41:40.520
whatever the faculty of language is, it has to be universal. It has to cover all languages,

41:41.160 --> 41:49.000
because an infant has equal access to all of them. Well, it's this collection of problems that has

41:49.720 --> 42:01.000
guided the inquiry into language for the last 60 or 70 years since the abandonment of the

42:01.640 --> 42:08.600
behaviorist structural restrictions and the return to what had been the tradition.

42:09.480 --> 42:18.600
And it seems that finally in the last few years we are getting to the point where we may have

42:18.600 --> 42:27.560
answers to these questions. So that, if it were to the extent it works out, is actually a new era

42:28.280 --> 42:38.920
in the long millennial long study of language. The first time when we can reach genuine explanations,

42:39.720 --> 42:49.240
satisfying, answering Plato's problem, Darwin's problem, and the universality of the theory.

42:49.800 --> 42:58.280
So let's look first at the universality. It seems recent research is increasingly

43:00.440 --> 43:07.320
attending towards the conclusion that the diversity of language is in the externalization

43:07.400 --> 43:20.040
and superficial things like choice of lexical, the way you, the sound you associate with a lexical

43:20.040 --> 43:32.200
item. So it could be, you know, Cat in English, Cha in French, something else in some other language.

43:33.160 --> 43:39.640
But that's superficial. That, of course, you can learn easily. But the concept, the

43:40.440 --> 43:47.640
meaning of the word that's already inside. So one aspect of variety is just

43:49.320 --> 43:57.240
association of sound and symbol. That's easy. There are others. There are many, the variety of

43:57.320 --> 44:04.920
languages looks on the surface, very large. So there are some languages. English happens to be a

44:04.920 --> 44:12.280
what's called a highly analytic language. Lots of simple words from one after the other to make

44:12.280 --> 44:18.280
a sentence. There are other languages at the opposite extreme. A sentence could be one word.

44:19.240 --> 44:27.800
And other words could be scattered around freely. Well, it's by now been learned over recent years

44:27.800 --> 44:33.640
that these apparently radically different languages are almost identical

44:34.600 --> 44:41.800
at the deeper level. They have the same internals, very much the same, maybe exactly the same

44:41.880 --> 44:49.160
internal structure, the internal language, the one that generates thoughts looks as if it's

44:50.440 --> 44:56.760
pretty much the same, maybe exactly the same, no matter how different the superficial appearance.

44:57.800 --> 45:05.800
I think that's not too surprising. The internal language can't be learned. We have absolutely

45:05.800 --> 45:11.320
almost no evidence for it. It's true of the meaning of words, true of things like structure,

45:11.880 --> 45:17.800
dependence, other major properties of language. So it makes sense for it to be

45:18.520 --> 45:26.680
identical among people or close to that. On the other hand, the externalization is not strictly

45:26.680 --> 45:33.240
language. Remember, it's an amalgam of language and sensory motor systems,

45:33.880 --> 45:39.880
which are totally divorced from language. Well, connecting these two things is

45:40.680 --> 45:46.680
fairly complex process. Two things that have no relation to one another can be done in many

45:46.680 --> 45:55.160
different ways. It's basically solving a hard cognitive problem. Different communities have

45:55.160 --> 46:01.880
solved the problem in different ways. So it looks complex. It's a complex problem.

46:02.840 --> 46:10.840
The internal language looks quite simple because it's based on very simple computational procedures.

46:11.640 --> 46:14.920
So on the one hand, we solve the problem of

46:16.920 --> 46:23.560
Darwin's problem. We have a very simple system. Solve the problem of

46:23.560 --> 46:33.640
Plato's problem because the learning is all in the superficial part. The internal part just

46:33.640 --> 46:39.880
isn't learned. It's just there, like structure, dependence, the ways of interpreting those sentences

46:39.880 --> 46:46.440
that I gave. And the variety is where you expect it to be in the complex problem of

46:47.400 --> 46:54.920
relating the internal language that produces thought to the external system that

46:55.960 --> 47:03.000
translates, that hands it over to the printer that allows other people to read and see and

47:03.000 --> 47:10.360
interpret it. To the extent that that can work out, you have genuine explanations.

47:11.080 --> 47:17.000
Well, that carries us on to the next chapter. How has it worked out?

47:18.040 --> 47:25.720
I'm going to give the barest hint of that here. So let's take the major principle of language,

47:26.760 --> 47:33.000
structure, dependence. Pretty remarkable principle. I wasn't even noticed until

47:33.000 --> 47:43.000
fairly recently in all the history of language. Again, the fact that all operations of the

47:43.000 --> 47:49.400
internal language, not externalization, all operations of the internal language that generates

47:49.400 --> 47:57.320
thought ignore linear order. There's no linear order there at all. Just abstract structures

47:57.320 --> 48:11.000
created by the mind and somatic interpretations, like the ones for river, house, book, every word

48:11.000 --> 48:20.120
you can think of, which are constructed by the mind. So let's take structure, dependence. How

48:20.120 --> 48:31.320
can we account for this? Well, we have to show that when language evolved, it mother nature

48:31.960 --> 48:39.400
hit upon the simplest possible combinatorial operation. The basic property of language,

48:40.200 --> 48:48.120
all languages, is that each language is what you know, what's the knowledge possessed is

48:48.120 --> 48:56.280
an infinite array of sentences, which are structured expressions, hierarchy of structures,

48:56.920 --> 49:05.640
and can somehow be assigned an interpretation as a thought, and by the externalization system

49:06.280 --> 49:12.200
mapped on to the printer sensory motor organs. That's the basic property.

49:13.160 --> 49:21.480
It's property called recursive generation. You have to generate an infinite array of expressions.

49:22.200 --> 49:30.840
Well, the understanding of how to do that developed really in the early part of the 20th

49:30.840 --> 49:40.520
century, as the theory of computation was developed by leading mathematicians, Kurt Gertl,

49:40.600 --> 49:49.320
Alan Turing, Alonzo Church, Emil Post, established the modern theory of computation,

49:49.960 --> 50:00.680
which shows clearly how a finite object like your laptop or your brain can store within it programs

50:01.320 --> 50:11.320
that can yield an infinite array of objects, expressions in our case, and do it in a way

50:11.320 --> 50:19.880
which could be hooked up to a printer. That allows us to ask what are the operations that

50:19.880 --> 50:30.520
mother nature would have hit upon as soon as some accident took place in the evolutionary record

50:30.760 --> 50:37.720
a couple hundred thousand years ago, and the property of recursive generation somehow appeared.

50:39.080 --> 50:45.000
What's the simplest way to deal with it? Well, the simplest computation happens to be

50:45.960 --> 50:53.880
what's called binary set formation, forming a set out of two elements, not changing either of them.

50:54.840 --> 51:01.960
You repeat that over and over again, you get hierarchic structures indefinitely.

51:03.480 --> 51:12.840
So a plausible evolutionary scenario is some accident took place, maybe some small mutation

51:13.960 --> 51:22.760
out of it came. A process of recursive generation mother nature then picked the simplest one,

51:23.640 --> 51:28.200
binary set formation, what's called merge in the recent literature,

51:28.840 --> 51:34.840
and then everything flowed from that. Structure dependence flows from it immediately.

51:36.280 --> 51:43.000
Many other properties do as well, where you can show that that's the case, you have a genuine

51:43.000 --> 51:49.240
explanation. Notice incidentally that this is the way evolution works generally.

51:49.240 --> 52:02.360
Evolution goes through all evolution, goes through three, I see a half of the question, but I can't

52:02.360 --> 52:16.360
read it. Okay, could you just hold it for a second, we'll come later. The way evolution works is

52:17.320 --> 52:27.560
three steps. First, some accident takes place, could be a mutation, cosmic ray passed by and

52:28.280 --> 52:37.320
changed the DNA slightly, an accident. It could be what's called symbiosis. So if you go back

52:38.280 --> 52:46.600
a couple hundred million years, it turned out that a bacterium, there were only bacteria and

52:46.600 --> 52:56.200
similar microorganisms at the time, one bacterium by accident swallowed another microorganism

52:57.400 --> 53:03.800
that led to the development of what are called eukaryotic cells, complex cells,

53:04.520 --> 53:14.120
the basis for complex life, our life for example. The third step is winnowing of the various

53:14.120 --> 53:22.440
things constructed in the second step, which ones have better reproductive capacity, that's

53:22.440 --> 53:32.040
natural selection, those are the ones that survive. So it seems to be the way language

53:32.040 --> 53:40.280
developed. First came some accident, maybe a mutation, which yielded recursive generation,

53:41.080 --> 53:48.200
then other nature comes along, tries to find the most elegant solution to the problem of

53:48.200 --> 53:55.720
how to deal with these new systems. In one case it was eukaryotic cells, in our case it was

53:56.120 --> 54:03.960
a generation by merge. The winning stage apparently never came for language,

54:04.840 --> 54:10.840
there's no winnowing stage or what we stayed the same, maybe because time just

54:12.120 --> 54:18.920
hasn't been long enough for natural selection to operate, maybe it's because at the second

54:19.480 --> 54:27.640
elegant stage the system was so closely integrated that you just can't change it or it falls

54:27.640 --> 54:35.880
apart. That would be a very interesting discovery and research is tending in the direction of

54:35.880 --> 54:44.280
showing that it's correct. Well time is running out, let me stop here, we're now reaching what would

54:44.280 --> 54:53.320
be the next chapter. How does all this work out in detail? But I think maybe if this succeeded you

54:53.320 --> 55:01.560
have a general picture of how we can hope to meet the Galilean challenge, the basic challenge in the

55:02.200 --> 55:11.160
history of the study of language in mind and do it in a way which can give genuine explanations

55:11.160 --> 55:19.640
for some quite remarkable properties of language and thought while leaving identifying

55:19.640 --> 55:26.680
other properties as a total mystery which we simply cannot comprehend. That seems to me

55:26.680 --> 55:38.840
pretty much where we stand today, I'll stop there. Thank you Noam, can you hear me okay?

55:39.800 --> 55:46.360
Great, so we'll have actually asked people to raise their hands for questions, I think it

55:46.360 --> 55:51.640
will be easier to moderate them but we did have a couple come in through chat and maybe

55:52.760 --> 55:59.960
we can start there. Leslie Bailey if you want to unmute yourself and ask your question go ahead.

56:01.560 --> 56:08.040
Oh great, okay I'm afraid this is a really really stupid question Noam, I'm sorry. If possible

56:08.040 --> 56:14.680
please restate the difference between the behavioral structural approach to language and

56:14.680 --> 56:20.840
what replaced it and how that transition occurred. I mean I know it's very complicated but if you

56:20.840 --> 56:27.080
could just say it in two sentences. It's quite interesting, let's take a look at how the

56:27.880 --> 56:35.480
structural linguists identified their own theory, their words. Structural linguistics

56:36.040 --> 56:44.200
was identified by mid 20th century, a consensus had been reached among the at that time

56:44.840 --> 56:50.840
fairly small number of structural linguists, it was a very small field then, a huge field now.

56:51.640 --> 56:57.880
The small, they reached the consensus that structural linguistics was what they called

56:57.880 --> 57:07.000
a taxonomic science. There were procedures of analysis, I was actually a student in the late

57:07.000 --> 57:14.520
40s studying this. You studied the procedures of analysis, here's what you do when you have an

57:14.520 --> 57:24.040
informant from a say Native American community, here are the procedures you use, of all you have

57:24.040 --> 57:30.120
as a text, here's the procedures of analysis you use, those procedures identify units,

57:30.760 --> 57:36.920
you organize the units, you're done. It's a taxonomic science, fields over.

57:37.800 --> 57:46.040
Okay so it's descriptive. Let me continue. There was also a theory of learning. It was

57:46.040 --> 57:54.440
stated explicitly by Leonard Bloomfield, the leading linguist, American linguist of the

57:54.440 --> 58:02.840
early 20th century. Language in his words is a matter of training and habit. If there's anything

58:02.840 --> 58:11.800
new produced, it's by analogy. Same view in philosophy of language. Take the major figures,

58:12.760 --> 58:22.120
W.E. Quine, Ludwig Wittgenstein, essentially the same. Language is a matter of training,

58:23.320 --> 58:30.440
habit, your Quine, Schenarian, operant conditioning, anything new is analogy.

58:32.280 --> 58:40.360
The new system that developed starting around the 20th century was essentially a return to the

58:40.360 --> 58:48.680
old tradition. We want to find explanations for linguistic phenomena. We want to find out why

58:48.680 --> 58:59.400
they work this way, not the other way. Why do we say the bombing of the cities is a crime, not

58:59.400 --> 59:06.840
or a crime? Essentially the 17th century questions. As soon as you started on that, you had the same

59:07.800 --> 59:14.920
transition that happened in the 17th century from knowing everything to knowing nothing.

59:15.880 --> 59:22.440
As soon as you started asking these questions, turned out you had no answer. Well, I should say

59:22.440 --> 59:30.280
that the entire tradition was totally unknown, completely forgotten, wasn't rediscovered until

59:30.280 --> 59:37.400
the 1960s after much of the ground had already been laid. The structuralist behaviors

59:38.120 --> 59:45.800
era essentially wiped out the history. But the new system that I've been discussing is

59:46.680 --> 59:51.320
essentially picking up from what the tradition was. I don't know if that's

59:51.960 --> 59:56.360
clear enough to answer the question. No, that's great. Thank you so much.

59:57.080 --> 01:00:03.400
All right, so our next question is from David Dalton. David, I just unmuted you, so you should

01:00:03.400 --> 01:00:11.000
be able to ask your question. Listen to our discussion here, and I ask, is not our consideration

01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:17.960
a little bit Anglo-centric in that English, yes, it has an alphabet of 26 characters,

01:00:18.600 --> 01:00:24.520
but if you look at Mandarin, it has an alphabet of 40,000 characters, only 2,000 of which are

01:00:24.600 --> 01:00:31.320
stand today. Not to mention that, Mandarin is a tonal language, whereas English is more of a

01:00:31.320 --> 01:00:39.880
literal language. And I don't know Mandarin myself, but I just wonder how is it that we can, with such

01:00:39.880 --> 01:00:47.320
broad brush strokes, compare all of language in this discussion, I would seem that there would be

01:00:47.400 --> 01:00:55.400
quite a bit of difference in the semantics of Mandarin versus English or say German or French.

01:00:56.840 --> 01:01:03.560
Well, I think the comment about the alphabet that I made was Galileo. He was, of course,

01:01:03.560 --> 01:01:12.680
thinking of Latin and Greek, but the alphabet is a very superficial matter. It's like the printer.

01:01:12.680 --> 01:01:20.280
You can use all sorts of alphabets. You can use the Mandarin style, the Korean style,

01:01:21.640 --> 01:01:29.800
hieroglyphs, just as you can use any printer. It turns out that the internal system for Mandarin,

01:01:30.600 --> 01:01:42.360
for English, for Youkuts, for Paraguay, for Tagalog, the internal systems are very much the same,

01:01:42.360 --> 01:01:49.320
maybe identical. Lots of languages are tonal languages, but they function essentially. That's

01:01:49.320 --> 01:01:57.880
just a different printer. And I mentioned just one example when I was talking. Languages like

01:01:58.600 --> 01:02:08.360
Youkuts is an example where a single word includes the whole sentence. It was thought for a long time

01:02:08.360 --> 01:02:14.920
that those languages must be very different. The more we discover, the more we find that

01:02:14.920 --> 01:02:22.920
at the internal level, they're the same. The internal means for constructing expressions

01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:29.640
and the semantics is either identical or very close to it. It doesn't look like that on the

01:02:29.640 --> 01:02:36.600
surface. You're quite right. On the surface, they look wildly different. And it was assumed,

01:02:36.600 --> 01:02:46.680
if you go back 50 years, it was assumed that languages can differ in just about every possible

01:02:46.680 --> 01:02:53.720
way. And when you study a particular language, you can't use any presuppositions from another

01:02:53.720 --> 01:03:01.240
language. That was sometimes called the Boazian principle. That's what I learned when I was a

01:03:01.240 --> 01:03:10.520
student. It seems to be completely wrong. It seems that at the core, all languages are either

01:03:11.080 --> 01:03:18.920
identical or very close to it. The systems that construct internal expressions in the mind,

01:03:19.800 --> 01:03:27.720
expressions of thought don't seem to differ. The externalization looks very different.

01:03:28.520 --> 01:03:37.640
They seem arranged differently, different sounds, and so on. But all of that seems superficial.

01:03:38.360 --> 01:03:47.560
To go back to the analogy of the laptop and the printer, what's the internal program in the laptop

01:03:48.520 --> 01:03:55.720
seems pretty close to common for all languages that we know, including very diverse ones.

01:03:56.440 --> 01:04:02.680
The printer can be very different. And the alphabet isn't even the printer. It's not the

01:04:02.680 --> 01:04:07.960
sounds. It's the representation of the sounds. So it's even more remote from language.

01:04:11.320 --> 01:04:15.640
Our next question is from Fran Manley. Fran, if you want to unmute yourself or I've

01:04:15.640 --> 01:04:19.880
unmuted you actually, Fran, you're good to go. Yeah, I got a two-part question, professor.

01:04:19.880 --> 01:04:24.520
One, is there any evidence as to whether or not other species, for example, like dogs,

01:04:25.240 --> 01:04:31.160
have a common language which allows them to communicate even with dogs they don't know?

01:04:31.880 --> 01:04:36.440
And my second question, if I may, is on children, I've been led to believe that

01:04:36.440 --> 01:04:41.880
children don't use a word unless they've heard it. But I got the impression from what you've said

01:04:41.880 --> 01:04:47.080
that's not necessarily so. They don't have to hear a word to learn it. Okay, thank you.

01:04:48.280 --> 01:04:54.120
Well, on the second one, children have to hear a word in order to not,

01:04:54.120 --> 01:04:59.160
not to, depends on what you mean by learn the word. They know the meaning of the word

01:04:59.720 --> 01:05:09.320
before they hear what the sounds are. So if you're a Chinese child, a Pottawatomie child,

01:05:10.120 --> 01:05:16.920
French child, whatever it may be, you have the meaning in your head. You don't know what sound

01:05:16.920 --> 01:05:23.800
is going to be associated with it. That you have to hear. And Lauderdale Gleitman and

01:05:24.520 --> 01:05:30.120
her work and others have shown that takes almost no, no, no experience.

01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:37.480
Couple here at a couple of times and you say, okay, that's the internal word that I know with

01:05:37.480 --> 01:05:43.800
all of its complex meaning. You do have to hear something to know whether it's pronounced cat

01:05:43.800 --> 01:05:49.480
or some other way. Okay, how about the animals? Do they have one language, form of language, other

01:05:49.480 --> 01:05:59.240
species? Do they have more? Do they have, do like, do animals or do other species have their own

01:05:59.240 --> 01:06:07.160
communication? Yeah. So animals, let's say dogs, I happen to have two of them on the desk at the

01:06:07.160 --> 01:06:13.560
moment. You heard a couple of them before. Well, I've looked at them pretty carefully.

01:06:14.520 --> 01:06:22.840
They were, they have a number of ideas in their heads, maybe a dozen or so.

01:06:24.360 --> 01:06:31.160
Sometimes they can do moderately complicated things. Like, I'll give you my favorite example.

01:06:31.960 --> 01:06:40.360
There's a big dog and a small dog. If the big dog wants to be taken, I hate to say the words

01:06:40.360 --> 01:06:46.200
because unfortunately, she'll hear them, but wants to be extricated to the outdoors,

01:06:47.480 --> 01:06:53.960
power phrase, which she doesn't understand. When she wants that, she has a trick to do it.

01:06:54.680 --> 01:07:01.320
She takes something away from the small dog and the small dog comes over to us to complain.

01:07:02.520 --> 01:07:08.680
And we make the big dog, give it, say a toy, give it back to the small dog, and then she

01:07:08.680 --> 01:07:16.920
runs right to the door and expects us to extricate her. Okay. So it's more of a behavior than a

01:07:16.920 --> 01:07:26.520
language, right? It's a small number of things. It's an entirely different from human language in

01:07:26.520 --> 01:07:34.760
every respect. Every animal that's known, including the closest to us, apes, monkeys,

01:07:35.720 --> 01:07:46.040
or have symbols, like take a vervet monkey, which has been studied carefully, has maybe a dozen

01:07:46.040 --> 01:07:55.400
calls. Like, if the leaves are fluttering in a tree, the vervet monkey will come out with a sound

01:07:56.440 --> 01:08:03.640
which makes all the other monkeys run away and hide. We interpret that as a warning sound.

01:08:04.200 --> 01:08:08.920
Maybe there's an eagle in the tree or something. I don't know what the monkey's thinking. But

01:08:10.920 --> 01:08:18.120
every, or can make another symbol, which is, we interpret as meaning, I'm hungry. Okay.

01:08:19.480 --> 01:08:28.440
The point is that each symbol is keyed explicitly to a physically identifiable entity.

01:08:28.440 --> 01:08:37.880
The motion of leaves in a tree, hormonal changes, something like that. Okay. Thank you.

01:08:37.880 --> 01:08:45.080
And none of the, none of the human symbols are like that. That's Aristotle's point about house.

01:08:45.720 --> 01:08:51.640
So they're radically different. Furthermore, there's no combinatorial structure in the

01:08:52.200 --> 01:09:01.240
animal systems. It's just a symbol. Now, there have been major efforts to try to train chimpanzees

01:09:02.120 --> 01:09:11.640
like infants. The main study you may have seen, it is called the NIMM study, named after me, actually,

01:09:12.440 --> 01:09:19.400
by a number of very fine cognitive scientists, some of them former students. Now, one of them

01:09:19.400 --> 01:09:27.720
a colleague and friend, they made an extensive effort to raise the chimpanzee NIMM from infancy

01:09:28.920 --> 01:09:39.320
pretty much the way you raise an infant, extensive efforts to get NIMM to pick up something like

01:09:39.320 --> 01:09:50.520
language. They used sign because the articulatory system for the chimpanzee doesn't work very well.

01:09:51.240 --> 01:09:57.160
So train it like an infant would learn sign. At first, they thought they were getting somewhere,

01:09:57.720 --> 01:10:04.280
but when they looked closely, it turned out it was nothing. It's just beyond the capacity

01:10:04.920 --> 01:10:12.280
of a highly intelligent ape to do anything like what a one- and two-year-old infant does.

01:10:12.280 --> 01:10:18.040
They're just built differently. There are things that other organisms do that we can't do,

01:10:18.840 --> 01:10:25.480
like I live in the desert. In the back of my house, there are desert ants who have cognitive

01:10:25.480 --> 01:10:33.160
capacities that I can't come close to. They can navigate in ways which I can't possibly do,

01:10:33.160 --> 01:10:39.240
maybe humans can duplicate it with complicated instruments, and they have a brain about the size

01:10:39.240 --> 01:10:48.280
of a miniscule brain. Organisms are just different. Our difference is we have the capacity for language.

01:10:48.840 --> 01:10:52.440
It doesn't have any counterpart anywhere. No.

01:10:57.080 --> 01:11:01.640
Our next question is from Les. I've unmuted you, Les, so go ahead and ask.

01:11:01.880 --> 01:11:11.000
Yeah, this question is maybe more philosophical, but the idea about thought and expression,

01:11:11.880 --> 01:11:21.720
can you have thoughts before expression internally, or do they rise simultaneously and cannot exist independently?

01:11:24.520 --> 01:11:31.240
Well, these are things where we can't introspect because it's all beyond the level of

01:11:31.240 --> 01:11:38.760
introspection, and there's no external scientific evidence. But the simplest theory,

01:11:39.480 --> 01:11:46.360
the simplest assumption, the one that would have to be disproved, is that they're just the same thing.

01:11:47.560 --> 01:11:57.080
The expression is the thought. There's an internal system which has provided we all have

01:11:57.960 --> 01:12:07.800
the knowledge we possess, includes an infinite array of these thoughts formulated in the linguistic

01:12:07.800 --> 01:12:18.440
system. When I produce a sentence, I pick out one of them somehow, how unknown, then I implement it.

01:12:18.440 --> 01:12:27.080
So there may be no distinction between thought and expression, no first or second.

01:12:28.680 --> 01:12:34.920
Just that's what the thoughts are. There's a repository of thoughts in linguistic form,

01:12:35.720 --> 01:12:41.480
and we can then implement them. And on the receptive side, you can reconstruct them.

01:12:42.440 --> 01:12:48.920
Maybe not the same way, maybe even in a different language, but something very much like them.

01:12:52.280 --> 01:12:56.040
Our next question is Joe Keller. Go ahead, Joe. I've unmuted you.

01:12:57.880 --> 01:13:04.440
Thank you, Scott. Professor, as the newly conceived human begins to develop her that

01:13:04.440 --> 01:13:11.400
inborn language structure, will her external experiences add to or enhance that structure in

01:13:11.400 --> 01:13:20.200
any way? Well, here we ought to pay attention to the way built-in structures work generally

01:13:21.400 --> 01:13:27.480
to take your visual system. The visual system does quite complicated things,

01:13:28.440 --> 01:13:36.040
very, there's time to talk about them, but very rich things. If your visual system is not

01:13:36.840 --> 01:13:45.320
stimulated in the early weeks of life, it'll degenerate. We know this from studies with

01:13:45.880 --> 01:13:53.560
other animals, cats, monkeys, and so on, in basis that we live about the same visual system.

01:13:54.440 --> 01:14:00.680
It's shown that unless a kitten is presented with pattern stimulation

01:14:01.560 --> 01:14:07.800
in the first couple of weeks of life, it'll be blind. That's the way

01:14:08.600 --> 01:14:14.920
and all instinctive behavior works like that. It has to be triggered by something,

01:14:15.000 --> 01:14:23.640
and then it is partially shaped, partially shaped by the way, by the stimulation.

01:14:24.280 --> 01:14:32.440
So it takes kittens again. If kittens are presented in the early weeks of life only with

01:14:33.080 --> 01:14:42.440
horizontal lines, then as a mature cat, it'll be able to perceive horizontal lines,

01:14:42.440 --> 01:14:48.440
not vertical lines. That's a little bit like different learning, different languages.

01:14:49.240 --> 01:14:56.600
You can shape the internal system marginally. You can't train a kitten to recognize

01:14:58.120 --> 01:15:03.480
curves, for example, in infancy. It has to be lines and different orientations.

01:15:05.160 --> 01:15:12.200
Lots of things can't get it to do, and that's the way instinctive behavior works quite generally.

01:15:12.200 --> 01:15:18.600
It seems to be the same with language as far as we know. The system is built in, the internal system

01:15:19.560 --> 01:15:28.120
has to be triggered in order to get started, to develop, then pretty much develops on its own

01:15:28.120 --> 01:15:36.200
course. There are some respects in which experience outside data shapes the system.

01:15:37.080 --> 01:15:45.240
One is the trivial one of how do you pronounce this? Others are, are you going to be like

01:15:46.200 --> 01:15:51.960
English, an analytic language with a lot of separate words that form a sentence?

01:15:52.680 --> 01:16:00.200
Or are you going to be like, let's say, a language where you have one huge word that

01:16:00.200 --> 01:16:10.040
includes everything? Well, that requires some stimulation. A large part of recent research,

01:16:10.040 --> 01:16:18.120
very recent research, is to try to sort out which parts are fixed and fundamental,

01:16:19.000 --> 01:16:27.640
which parts are provided by the shaping expective experience. It's turned out pretty surprising.

01:16:28.440 --> 01:16:38.280
So 40 or 50 years ago, the greatest anthropological linguists, friends of all of us here,

01:16:39.160 --> 01:16:45.560
Ken Hale, former teacher's friend, one of the leading anthropological and

01:16:46.520 --> 01:16:54.440
formal linguists of the past generation, he firmly believed that languages differed in

01:16:55.400 --> 01:17:03.000
what's called a parameter, an option of choices. Some had flat structure with no hierarchy,

01:17:03.560 --> 01:17:11.560
some like English had hierarchy. And it looked, that's the way the evidence looked. Over time,

01:17:12.200 --> 01:17:21.320
actually Ken, Ken Hale and his students, Julie Legge, were able to show that even the most extreme

01:17:21.320 --> 01:17:28.760
cases of languages that looked like completely free word order or flat no structure, even they

01:17:28.760 --> 01:17:35.240
had the same internal structure as the hierarchical languages. These are real discoveries, major

01:17:35.240 --> 01:17:42.760
discoveries of the past couple of decades. And we don't know how far it'll go, but I think it's

01:17:42.760 --> 01:17:50.040
a reasonable guess by now that it'll probably go to showing that the internal system that generates

01:17:50.040 --> 01:17:57.640
thought is either uniform or very close to it, and that the apparent variety and complexity

01:17:58.360 --> 01:18:04.440
and mutability, the change from generation to generation, all of that's probably in the

01:18:04.440 --> 01:18:11.480
externalization and the trivial lexical properties, like do you pronounce it cat or some other way.

01:18:11.880 --> 01:18:18.680
Our next question is Miriam Burt. Miriam, you are unmuted, go ahead.

01:18:19.480 --> 01:18:24.760
Thank you. I think my question, Professor, probably follows on pretty well to the recent one,

01:18:24.760 --> 01:18:32.600
the one you just responded to. You said earlier that around two years to 30 months is this riot,

01:18:32.600 --> 01:18:39.880
this wonderful time when, you know, they're learning a new word or a new every waking hours.

01:18:39.960 --> 01:18:47.720
But I wonder if a child, if she's deprived of both that visual stimulation and the language,

01:18:47.720 --> 01:18:52.680
you know, the auditory to hear the words from, because she's in an orphanage or, you know, in a

01:18:52.680 --> 01:19:01.080
very poverty state, if you will, you know, for external stimuli. Will she be able to catch up

01:19:01.720 --> 01:19:08.920
if she is subsequently, you know, exposed to this, this stimuli, you know, internally and

01:19:08.920 --> 01:19:13.880
externally, I mean, visually and auditorially, or is she always going to be a little behind

01:19:13.880 --> 01:19:22.680
and not quite up to what she could be. Thank you. That's a very, it's a very difficult question,

01:19:22.680 --> 01:19:33.080
because we cannot do experiments. You don't do experiments with humans. Rightly or wrongly,

01:19:33.080 --> 01:19:40.360
we do do them with cats and monkeys. That's how we know about the visual system, which is pretty

01:19:40.360 --> 01:19:46.200
much shared with us. Can't do it with any other organism, because no other organism with anything

01:19:46.280 --> 01:19:54.520
remotely like language. So we just have to look at the experiences that we see. And they're,

01:19:56.200 --> 01:20:03.560
they're very interesting. You learn a lot from them. So there's a very fine neuroscientist

01:20:04.520 --> 01:20:13.240
named Helen Neville, Oregon State University, who done fine work on the brain and language.

01:20:13.720 --> 01:20:19.560
Actually, about 30 years ago, she got interested in pretty much this question.

01:20:20.520 --> 01:20:31.480
She took children who are what are called low SES, socioeconomic status, and who seemed to be

01:20:32.040 --> 01:20:37.240
problems in school. They weren't learning. They couldn't speak to all kind of behavioral and

01:20:37.240 --> 01:20:44.040
other problems. And she began to study them carefully. She noticed some interesting things.

01:20:44.760 --> 01:20:53.160
Their parents don't talk to them. I mean, they say, get out or go outside or leave me alone.

01:20:53.160 --> 01:20:59.320
And not because they're bad people, they're just people who are trying to survive on two jobs in

01:20:59.320 --> 01:21:05.640
miserable circumstances. Parents never read them stories. You know, they've never had that experience.

01:21:06.280 --> 01:21:12.360
So she tried a simple experiment, trying to bring the parents and the children together

01:21:13.240 --> 01:21:22.360
and encourage them just in some free time to interact, like have a mother read a story to

01:21:22.360 --> 01:21:29.880
the children, things like that. Turned out they enjoyed it. They did more of it. They started

01:21:29.960 --> 01:21:35.640
having much higher cognitive achievements. Weren't problems in schools and so on.

01:21:37.080 --> 01:21:42.440
Well, that's a partial answer to your question. I'll mention another real experiment,

01:21:43.640 --> 01:21:51.400
real event. It's a very fine, another cognitive neuroscientist to come and Massimo know very well.

01:21:52.360 --> 01:22:02.280
He lives in Massachusetts. He began working with children who were such extreme behavior problems

01:22:02.280 --> 01:22:09.240
that they were basically excluded from school. They couldn't stay in a classroom, had to be

01:22:09.240 --> 01:22:17.640
excluded. He started working with them, looking at them carefully. He immediately found out

01:22:17.640 --> 01:22:25.000
that these were kids who came from homes where they didn't eat breakfast. They didn't eat breakfast.

01:22:25.000 --> 01:22:31.160
They got on a school bus. The bus roamed around for an hour. They finally got to the school.

01:22:31.800 --> 01:22:38.200
They were out of their heads. They were sent to maybe an arithmetic class.

01:22:39.160 --> 01:22:43.560
Here they couldn't pay any attention. They ran around the room and so on.

01:22:44.120 --> 01:22:49.720
Well, he started doing something. For one thing, when they came to school, the first thing he did

01:22:49.720 --> 01:22:57.240
was give them candy because their glucose levels were low. They hadn't eaten. Then,

01:22:57.240 --> 01:23:03.160
instead of putting them right in an arithmetic class, he let them stay outside and run around

01:23:03.160 --> 01:23:10.120
for half an hour. Then they brought them into school. Other things like that. By now, these kids

01:23:10.120 --> 01:23:16.440
are performing considerably better than the average in the public school system.

01:23:17.560 --> 01:23:25.800
Well, I think that's the kind of evidence that we have about your question. It's a humanly,

01:23:25.800 --> 01:23:32.440
very significant question. We can't do direct experiments on it. We're not going to deprive

01:23:32.440 --> 01:23:37.880
children and see what happens. You take the natural experiments and see what you can find out.

01:23:38.680 --> 01:23:45.320
I think the basic answer is that if the deprivation is not too severe,

01:23:46.280 --> 01:23:53.640
the child can probably recover normal cognitive capacity. If the deprivation is extremely

01:23:53.640 --> 01:24:00.440
severe and there are such cases, the child is simply deprived of external contact,

01:24:01.080 --> 01:24:08.360
maybe a sociopathic father, something like that, then they may never recover.

01:24:08.360 --> 01:24:13.480
But it's hard to know what's caused. There's a famous case, Jeanne, which you may have read

01:24:13.480 --> 01:24:21.320
about, but it's hard to know what the lack of recovery is from because any kid like that is

01:24:21.320 --> 01:24:28.920
going to be psychotic. If you're brought up, tied to a chair till you're 12 years old with somebody

01:24:29.000 --> 01:24:35.880
throwing food at you, you're going to be psychotic if you can even survive. So how much is that

01:24:35.880 --> 01:24:43.080
interfering with what's happening? Well, we don't know and we don't want to do the experiments,

01:24:43.080 --> 01:24:52.360
which will answer it. We've got about five minutes left. Our next question is from Linda Green.

01:24:52.360 --> 01:25:01.080
Linda, you are unmuted. Go ahead. My question has to do with brain research.

01:25:01.080 --> 01:25:06.600
What contemporary brain research is shedding light on linguistics?

01:25:08.520 --> 01:25:16.120
Well, it's difficult because brain research altogether is very difficult and brain research

01:25:16.200 --> 01:25:24.040
on humans is particularly difficult because we do not allow invasive experiments.

01:25:25.800 --> 01:25:34.360
With a cat, we allow ourselves to stick an electrode into a neuron and see what it's doing.

01:25:35.400 --> 01:25:43.080
You don't do that with humans. So it's all kind of evidence you can pick up by external

01:25:44.040 --> 01:25:49.960
imaging and so on. And you can learn a great deal. In fact, the most important discovery

01:25:50.600 --> 01:25:56.520
about this actually has to do with what I call structure dependence, the fact that

01:25:57.480 --> 01:26:06.440
the computational operations of language make no use of 100% of what we hear, words in linear order.

01:26:06.520 --> 01:26:09.640
They only deal with abstract structures in the mind.

01:26:11.000 --> 01:26:17.240
They're very ingenious experiments initiated by a friend and colleague of ours,

01:26:17.880 --> 01:26:27.880
Andrea Moro, Italian linguist, neuroscientist. He and his colleagues devised experiments on

01:26:27.880 --> 01:26:37.480
the following paradigm. They took subjects, two groups of subjects who happened to be

01:26:37.480 --> 01:26:47.240
speakers of German and presented them with invented systems. One of them modeled on

01:26:49.160 --> 01:26:56.840
Japanese language that they'd never heard. Another, using simple rules which violated

01:26:56.840 --> 01:27:05.960
structure dependency. So a rule that says, if you want to negate a sentence, take the negative

01:27:05.960 --> 01:27:12.600
particle, say not, and make it the third word of the sentence. Very trivial computation.

01:27:13.720 --> 01:27:20.040
They asked how subjects responded to this. Well, it turned out that when they were given a language

01:27:20.760 --> 01:27:30.520
modeled on a natural language, the areas of the brain that are mostly involved in language

01:27:30.520 --> 01:27:38.120
processing and use all fired up the way you'd expect them to. When they were given the system,

01:27:39.160 --> 01:27:47.080
the artificial system with simple computations on linear order, they just got diffuse activity

01:27:47.080 --> 01:27:55.080
in the brain, meaning the brain is treating it as a puzzle, not a language. That's quite an

01:27:55.080 --> 01:28:01.400
interesting result, certain replicated, there's different variants of it and so on. But that's

01:28:01.400 --> 01:28:08.600
the kind of thing that can be done. There are other, there is other experimental work in

01:28:08.600 --> 01:28:16.920
neuro linguistics which shows a number of things. All right, we probably have one quick

01:28:16.920 --> 01:28:22.360
question, Ralph Losty, if you'd like to, I've got you on muted Ralph, if you'd like to ask your

01:28:22.360 --> 01:28:30.760
question. Yes, I just read recently about the multi-language brain. And it looks like people

01:28:30.760 --> 01:28:41.240
with multi-language capabilities are actually perform worse than mono-language brain. And how

01:28:41.240 --> 01:28:48.040
could that be when you said the languages are the universe? So the thoughts of being universal

01:28:48.840 --> 01:28:57.000
and they should express, okay. Well, first, I don't know what you saw, but I don't believe it.

01:28:57.960 --> 01:29:06.840
Every child is easily capable of learning many languages in infancy. It's very common in many

01:29:06.840 --> 01:29:14.040
cultures for a child to know three or four languages. They don't even know their different

01:29:14.040 --> 01:29:19.560
languages. This is the way you talk to your mother, this is the way you talk to your grandfather,

01:29:20.280 --> 01:29:26.280
this is the way you talk to the kids in the street. Finally, at some age, maybe four or five,

01:29:26.280 --> 01:29:33.160
they may realize, hey, I'm speaking different languages. But it's just normal. As far as we

01:29:33.160 --> 01:29:41.400
know, every child can do that. There's no known difference between, there's no even any way of

01:29:41.400 --> 01:29:50.280
studying it, because all children have this multi-language capacity. But I'd be very skeptical

01:29:50.280 --> 01:29:58.040
about the source you looked at, frankly. Thank you so much. Well, I think that's all the time we

01:29:58.040 --> 01:30:05.160
have today that Professor Chomsky, we really appreciate having you present to us. And I'm

01:30:05.160 --> 01:30:09.560
grateful to know as I, when I was a child, and I probably begged for a candy for breakfast that

01:30:09.560 --> 01:30:17.960
it wasn't a bad thing. But no, I, we really appreciate you being here. And again, thank the

01:30:17.960 --> 01:30:24.120
Department of Linguistics at the University of Arizona for hosting this session and course,

01:30:24.120 --> 01:30:28.280
and appreciate it so much. Do you have any other parting words for us, sir?

01:30:31.080 --> 01:30:36.520
I hope some of you will be interested enough to look into the meat of the subject,

01:30:36.520 --> 01:30:44.120
how it's actually done next chapter. We did have a few people inquiring about

01:30:45.080 --> 01:30:50.360
the publications and things that would be of good service to kind of get a general

01:30:50.360 --> 01:30:53.400
understanding of this area of study. What are your recommendations?

01:30:55.720 --> 01:31:04.040
Well, I have a book called What Kind of Creatures Are We, which goes into many of these questions.

01:31:04.280 --> 01:31:11.800
But there's a lot more work. They're very, I should say, they're excellent general introductions

01:31:12.360 --> 01:31:22.680
to language. There's a book by Charles Yang called The Infinite Gift, which

01:31:24.120 --> 01:31:30.680
focuses a lot on acquisition, but brings up these things. There's a recent book by

01:31:31.400 --> 01:31:40.120
David Adger, A-D-G-E-R. I think it's called something like The Infinite Mind or something

01:31:40.120 --> 01:31:46.920
like that, which is an excellent introductory discussion at a high level to many of us.

01:31:49.240 --> 01:31:56.760
There's a very fine general introduction to many aspects of language by an outstanding

01:31:56.760 --> 01:32:05.400
linguist, Ian Roberts. It's called The Wonders of Language, which goes into these and many other

01:32:05.400 --> 01:32:14.360
things. There's a lot of very high-level introductory literature for syntax, the kind

01:32:14.360 --> 01:32:21.880
of thing I'm talking about. Our colleague here, Andrew Carney, has a book simply called Syntax,

01:32:21.880 --> 01:32:29.400
which goes into many of these things in a very lucid way, but in considerable detail.

01:32:32.520 --> 01:32:39.960
Well, thank you again so much. We really appreciate it. I can't unmute everybody apparently.

01:32:39.960 --> 01:32:51.640
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you so much. Absolutely outstanding. Thank you so much.

01:32:53.240 --> 01:33:03.160
Thank you, Professor. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, fabulous. Thank you.

01:33:09.960 --> 01:33:13.160
Thank you.
