0	18120	All right, well, Noam Chomsky, I think it's time for me to turn this over to you.
18120	25640	I really want to give you a great big welcome from OliU of A and appreciate your coming today
25640	31800	and presenting to our organization and we're truly an honor and a privilege to have you
31800	38520	with us and I know that a number of emails have gone out and I don't think any introduction
38520	48160	is honestly needed because but can you hear me thank you for joining us and I'll let you
48160	49680	take it over.
49680	59920	Okay, thank you very much. I'd like to have a few words about the maker of language,
59920	71200	its acquisition, origins, its use and so far as we understand these matters today and I'd like to
71200	82040	approach this within the broader context of the inquiry into language and mind which are
82040	92640	the distinctive properties of the human species. Well, good place to start is at the beginning of
92640	103000	their historical records, classical Greece, the Delphic Oracle, which produced the maxim,
103000	118040	know thyself. Well, two word aphorism is open to many interpretations. The intended
118040	128760	interpretation was individual, you the individual should know yourself and unexamined life is not
128760	138360	worth living, the platonic expansion of this, but it makes good sense to understand the maxim of
138360	149040	the oracle collectively, know ourselves. The reason is that we're pretty much similar. It's a
149040	159680	very young species. Humans have only been around for two to 300,000 years. That's early in eye
159680	171440	blink and evolutionary time. It's been mentioned by evolutionary biologists, partly as a joke,
171440	181840	partly real, that if you see two squirrels in a tree outside your window, they very likely are
181920	192920	more diverse genetically than all of the humans in the world. Humans have arisen within a very
192920	202200	narrow window of evolutionary time and they have unique properties. One of these properties is
202520	211480	human language. There's no analog, no similar properties anywhere in the organic world.
211480	222320	Furthermore, it's a species property. It's not only unique to humans, but uniform among humans.
223280	234160	It means that any infant can acquire any language with equal facility, as far as we know. So it's
234160	244200	a species property, virtually definitive of humans. There is another one thought, at least thought in
244840	254440	any form that we can grasp and understand. The kind of thought that made it possible to produce the
254440	264200	maxim of the oracle, to interpret it, to reflect on its significance, myriad other mental activities
264360	278280	that occupy us all day, even in sleep, just again a common human property, totally unique to humans.
279160	288040	Well, when you have two unique species properties, it makes good sense to ask what relation holds
288040	296760	between them. The simplest relation would be simply identity. Language constructs thought.
297640	304600	Thought is what is constructed by language and that is the conclusion that was reached
305560	316360	2,500 years ago, classical India, classical Greece, and it's a tradition that runs through millennia.
317560	327000	Late 19th century, a great American linguist, William Whitney, simply defined language as
327000	334600	audible thought, basically thought, which we happen to externalize through the mouth,
335560	342920	pick up through the ear. We now know that that's too narrow. You can use any other sensory motor
342920	352360	system. So if I don't know if this is being translated into sign, but if it is, you would be
352360	359400	seeing the same thing in sign language, which works very much the same as spoken language,
359960	367000	in the way it's acquired structure, the way it's used down to small details,
367640	375160	even the way it's norally stored. Well, you can think of the language as being
376040	384760	kind of like a program that's in your laptop. So suppose you have a program in your laptop,
384760	393400	calculator, or say, multiplying numbers. The program works by itself. You can attach it to a
393400	404520	printer, could be a printer that uses colors, dark letters, and one font, another font. The program
404600	414200	doesn't care. It can be hooked up to, sorry, try to be louder. It can be hooked up, is this any better?
415400	423880	Can be hooked up to any printer that you want. The program stays the same. And language seems
423880	431880	very much like that. There's an internal system constructing thoughts. It can be hooked up to
431880	440440	one sensory motor system or another to externalize it. But the program seemed to be the same.
441480	448280	Well, let me make a side comment here on the history and then return to the
448920	457240	mainstream of the discussion. What I've just been describing is basically the long millennial,
457240	464600	long tradition of the study of language in mind that goes right into the 20th century.
465880	476840	Early 20th century had changed. The general view in the early 20th century still largely surviving
477480	485160	is that language is not primarily an instrument, the means of thought, but rather it's a system
485160	496600	of communication. That's sort of the mantra today in philosophy of language, much of linguistics,
496600	506600	cognitive science. This, I think, is a result of the rise of behaviorism in the 20th century,
507480	519400	which drove scientists, philosophers, others to look at what's visible, what's apparent,
519400	527160	behavior, to keep away from hidden things like what's going on in your mind. That was a very
527160	534600	sharp departure from the scientific tradition. It's very anti-scientific in my view. It became
535560	541560	quite dominant, especially in the first half of the 20th century. There's also a kind of a
542280	549160	primitive version of Darwinism, which does have its roots in Darwin's writings,
549880	558840	the idea that all changes through evolution must be small changes, which operate through
559480	568280	natural selection and over time may give large-scale differences. It's now known that that's
568280	579080	completely false, but the residue of that does lead you to the belief, the illusion in my view,
579720	586920	that language somehow must have emerged from simpler systems, going back to
587000	593800	animal communication. The evidence is strongly against that, and there's nothing in
593800	600120	evolutionary biology that leads to such conclusions. Actually, this is,
601480	611080	notice that this behaviorist turn is a turn away from the effort to understand and explain
611960	621240	in effort to describe basically what you see in Silicon Valley linguistics, the kind that makes
621240	629640	the headlines about the things that it's claimed that machines can do. Associated with this was
630600	636760	conception of how language is acquired, dominant conception, philosophy of language,
637480	645160	linguistics, language is acquired through training and instituting habits,
645880	653800	if there's anything new that's said by analogy, all completely wrong, completely reshuted,
653800	660440	still very common. Well, let's go back to the tradition, which I think was on the right course.
661400	670200	The study of language took a large step forward with the 17th century scientific revolution.
671240	680360	The primary lesson of the scientific revolution was that you should be puzzled by simple things
680360	689640	that you take for granted. So, a heavy ball of lid plainly falls faster than a light one.
690520	698360	Except that it doesn't, as Galileo showed with elegant thought experiments,
699720	708840	take a sailboat moving through the sea. I suppose there's a lid ball on the top of the mast.
710200	718920	If it falls, it should fall behind the mast. Of course, the sailboat is moving forward, except
718920	727960	that it doesn't fall to the base of the mast. Again, Galileo showed this with thought experiments.
728520	735240	If he'd done an actual experiment, the results would have been all over the place. But as in
735880	745080	much of science, then and since, the idea was to construct ideal situations, often by thought,
745720	755160	sometimes by careful experiment, if you can, that bring out the hidden reality between behind the
756280	764760	phenomena that you see, which are always complex. Many variables can't be studied. That's why
764760	772120	scientists do experiments. Well, if you go back to scholastic science in the 16th century,
772920	781720	what Galileo and his contemporaries were struggling against, scholastic science had answers to
781720	790040	everything. If a ball falls to the ground and steam rises, it's because they're going to their
790040	799240	natural place. If two objects attract or repel each other, it's because they have sympathies
799240	807560	and antipathies. If you perceive a triangle, it's because the form of the triangle
809320	814760	passes through the air and implants itself in your brain. So there was an answer to everything.
815960	823880	All the answers were wrong. They were based on what modern science called occult qualities,
824600	833240	invented concepts that don't exist, and the willingness to be puzzled by things opened the
833240	841800	door to the new science, the science of the last several hundred years. The scholastic science
841800	850600	had answers to everything. The new science had no answers to anything. That's how serious inquiry
850680	858360	begins. And the same has been true of the study of language in the last 60 or 70 years,
859320	866200	breaking with the behaviorist, structuralist tradition. Well, let's take a look at language.
867000	874680	There are simple things that we take for granted. We talk to each other. We understand each other.
875560	883880	What could be simpler than that? Well, to the new scientists, Galileo and his contemporaries,
884600	891880	this seemed an extraordinary puzzle. Amazing. How can it be that with just
892920	900040	a few symbols we can produce, we can construct in our minds infinitely many thoughts,
900920	907400	never before expressed, never in the history of the language, and we can even
908920	917480	convey to others who have no access to our minds, we can convey to them the innermost
917480	926200	working of our minds. They regarded this as an amazing phenomenon. In fact, Galileo himself
926200	935080	regarded the alphabet as the most spectacular of human inventions because it facilitated this
935080	949400	astonishing quality. And it is indeed a remarkable fact. It's been repeated by others. One famous case
949400	959560	is Gottlob Frege a couple of centuries later, the founder of modern logic and logical philosophy
960360	968920	mid-19th century. He wrote that, I'm quoting him, he found it astonishing what language
968920	977560	accomplishes. With a few syllables, it expresses a countless number of thoughts and even for a
977560	986040	thought grasped for the first time by a human, it provides a clothing in which it can be recognized
986040	997000	by another to whom it is entirely new. It's essentially Galileo's insight. And it raises
997080	1011080	very deep questions. How can this possibly be the case? This initiated a rich study of what
1011080	1018920	centuries study of what was called universal and rational grammar. Universal because it tried to
1018920	1026600	cover all languages. Rational because it was interested in explanation and not description.
1027560	1035400	Very different from the structural linguistics and philosophy of language of the first half
1035400	1044680	of the 20th century, which described itself as a taxonomic science. We have procedures of analysis
1045400	1055000	you can apply them to data that you come up with an organization of the data. It's basically today's
1055000	1061640	Silicon Valley. That's doesn't care about understanding, doesn't care about explanation,
1061640	1071320	just organization of data. A radical change from traditional science, including the science of
1071320	1081480	language. Again, the old tradition was picked up, revived around mid 20th century. Well,
1082120	1091400	it does raise the problems for Descartes in the 17th century. It was the basis for his establishment
1091400	1103560	of the classical mind body problem. Descartes accepted the basic idea of the new science, Galileo,
1104680	1111800	Royal Society in England, later Newton, others that the world is basically a machine,
1112680	1120840	a complex machine, the kind of machine that could be built in principle by a skilled artisan,
1121640	1129640	and that in their theology in fact was created by a super skilled artisan. Machine means something
1130440	1138760	built out of gears and levers and pulleys and so on. That's the world. But Descartes recognized
1139320	1148840	that there are certain things that didn't seem to fall within machine science, what was called at
1148840	1156440	the time mechanical philosophy. Philosophy meant science. So there were things that didn't fall
1156440	1167480	within it. One of the most striking ones Descartes felt correctly is the creative aspect of language
1167480	1177960	use. What amazed Galileo, his contemporaries centuries later, Freda, how is this possible
1178600	1186680	for a machine? It is impossible for a machine. And that led Descartes, a sensible scientist,
1187240	1196120	to postulate a new principle, a thinking principle, mind. That's the mind body problem.
1197160	1205960	Next task for Descartes and other sciences was to see how they're unified. Well, I quickly
1207320	1213320	ran into, sorry, somebody's at the door, my dogs are unhappy about it.
1214280	1228840	This collapsed pretty quickly. Isaac Newton's great discovery was that the world is not a machine.
1229640	1236360	There are no machines. There are no bodies in the sense, any sense of body that we have.
1237080	1244840	The world is just not intelligible to us. That was the criterion of intelligibility.
1246200	1256280	John Locke immediately recognized that, as he put it within his theological framework,
1257160	1266280	just as God has attributed to whatever exists, properties that we cannot conceive,
1267000	1275160	like interaction without contact. So God may have super added to whatever there is,
1275720	1283480	the property of thought. Thought is just a property of organized matter, whatever matter,
1283480	1295080	turns out to be. All of this was worked out extensively through the 18th century,
1295960	1304840	then forgotten, totally forgotten, revived in the mid 20th century. It's now become
1305800	1315080	a standard idea after a long period of neglect. Well, that leaves us with serious mysteries.
1315960	1323960	How is all of this possible? And the answer to that question is, we don't know. We do not know
1324600	1333720	how it is possible to answer Galileo, how it is possible for or frigate with a small number of
1333720	1344440	symbols to construct new thoughts, new to us, maybe new in history, to somehow transmit them
1344440	1352280	to others in such a way that they can interpret the inner workings of our minds. A lot of this is
1352840	1361640	just unintelligible to us. Well, there are parts of it that we can understand.
1361880	1368360	Here, we have to make a distinction, which was actually discussed by Aristotle,
1368360	1376760	but then forgotten until the 20th century. The distinction is between possession of knowledge
1376760	1385720	and use of knowledge. It's a crucial distinction in modern technical terminology. For those of
1386680	1393320	you familiar with that, that's the distinction between what's called competence and performance,
1394040	1406760	what we know and what we use. The internal language provides us with a store of an infinite
1406840	1418440	number of possible thoughts. That's our possession of knowledge. Our use of knowledge is perception
1418440	1429160	and production. When you perceive the noises that I'm making, you are accessing your internal store
1429160	1436840	of knowledge to provide an interpretation for these noises that you're hearing. When I produce a
1436840	1446440	sentence, I'm carrying out two acts. The first act is selecting a thought from the store of
1446440	1456120	possible thoughts. The second act is implementing it using the various mechanisms of my mind,
1456120	1464840	my articulatory system to externalize that internal thought. The second part of it,
1464840	1471640	we can study and understand. The first part of it, selecting the thought, is completely
1471640	1479240	beyond our understanding. We have no idea how this takes place. It's part of the general mystery of
1479960	1490840	voluntary action, which is basically to us an impenetrable mystery. Well, just keeping to what
1490840	1500200	we can hope to understand, the system of language that constructs thoughts, the formation of the
1500200	1509800	internal language, keeping to that, we can discover some quite remarkable properties.
1510920	1519080	Following the tradition of early modern science, let's take simple cases. Take the sentence,
1519480	1530680	the bombing of the cities is a crime. Notice it's is a crime, not are a crime. Actually,
1530680	1537960	that's puzzling when you think about it. Why doesn't the verb is agree with the closest
1537960	1546360	noun phrase? The closest noun phrase is cities. So why don't we say the bombing of the cities
1546360	1557240	are a crime? Okay, let's take the bombings of the city is a crime, or a crime, the bombings of the
1557240	1566440	city are a crime. Why don't we say the bombings of the city is a crime? Again, just using the
1566440	1573240	simple problem for property of adjacency. When you look at it, you see that what humans are doing
1574200	1586440	is ignoring the simplest possible computational procedure, adjacency, and instead using a complex
1586440	1594520	procedure, finding, not looking just at the linear order of words, but finding a structure,
1594520	1601720	and then finding the central element within that structure. It turns out to be pretty complicated
1601720	1609720	computation. But that's what we do reflexively. And in fact, that's what every infant does.
1610600	1619480	You can show by experiment that this is what infants do down to before the age of two 30 months
1619480	1627080	of age can't obviously can. And this is true of all constructions in all languages.
1628040	1634040	Just to give another example, a little more complicated, take the sentence,
1636280	1647160	the man who fixed the car carefully packed his tools. The man who fixed the car carefully
1647160	1654360	packed his tools. Notice it's ambiguous. He could fix the car carefully, or he could carefully
1654360	1663640	pack his tools. Now put the adverb carefully in the front of the sentence. Carefully, the man who
1663640	1673640	fixed the car packed his tools. Unambiguous. It means carefully packed his tools. And it's
1673640	1680840	unambiguous in a puzzling way. Carefully looks for a verb, but it doesn't look for the closest
1680840	1688520	verb. It looks for the more remote one, which if you build up the structure is the structurally
1688520	1696760	closest one. So what you're doing is what everyone is doing reflexively is ignoring
1698120	1706840	the linear order of words and attending only to structures that you never hear and that your
1706840	1716200	mind creates. Give one last example, take the sentence, the man who saw Bill is young.
1717880	1728280	Suppose I didn't hear the word Bill clearly. I say, I want to ask who it is. So I say, who is the man
1728280	1740280	who saw young? Jibberish. Can't say that. Fine thought. You can't say it. You have to, you can only
1741880	1751640	say you can't use the simplest computational procedure and find the closest occurrence of who
1752200	1761000	and put it in the front. Splock. Well, this is universal. As I say, children of 30 months old
1761000	1769160	know it, all constructions, all languages. What it means is the infant, all infants,
1769160	1777720	are ignoring 100% of what they hear, which is words in linear order. They're ignoring
1778360	1787480	very simple computations on linear order and they are reflexively paying attention to something
1787480	1795240	they never hear that their minds create and using computations on those abstract structures.
1796120	1802840	It's a pretty remarkable fact when you think about it and that is the kind of thing we discover
1803560	1812840	as soon as you try to answer the Galilean challenge. This property is called structure
1812840	1819480	dependence in the technical literature. Pretty much the same as true of learning of words.
1820440	1830600	There is a myth, standard myth, that the way children learn words is they see a cat. Their
1830600	1839240	mother says cat. They make an association between the thing they see and the sound your mother produced
1839240	1846520	and this is repeated over and over again in many circumstances, different situations. Finally,
1846520	1855160	the kid figures out that the sound cat goes along with that feline object. Totally false.
1855880	1861640	Nothing like that happens. There's a very careful experimentation on this by now.
1863480	1872120	Primary research and this is wonderful scientist, Lila Gleitman, who old friend passed away a couple
1872120	1882120	of weeks ago. What Lila Gleitman showed in her experiments is that children pick up words and
1882120	1892760	the meaning of words on one or two presentations. At the peak period of language learning,
1893400	1901080	around two years old, children are picking up words at about one every waking hour,
1901800	1908760	which means that they hear them once, maybe twice. They usually don't pay attention to
1908760	1914280	their mothers, just whatever is going on in the circumstances and they know the meanings of the
1914280	1922520	words. The meaning of the word, when you look at it, is very complex. No time to go into this,
1922520	1929720	but when you really look at the meanings of words, you find out that they are quite rich.
1929720	1937080	Well, actually, let me mention a few examples from classical Greece where this matter was discussed.
1938040	1947160	So, take Aristotle again. He took us as an example, the word house. He said,
1947800	1956040	what is a house? What's the meaning of the word house? And he said, well, it has two components.
1957000	1966120	One is what he called matter. It's the bricks, the timbers, the physical things that the
1966760	1973320	house is made up of. The other is what he called form, an idea in the mind.
1974680	1982360	The characteristic way the object is used, the thought in the mind of the architect who
1982360	1989480	constructed the way we conceive of it. So, something could look exactly like a house,
1990600	1998120	physically, but it could be a library, if that's the way it's used. It could be a garage,
1999080	2005240	could be a stable, could actually be a paperweight for a giant, could be whatever
2005640	2012840	we conceive of it, whatever the architect has in mind. That is a consequence, and that's quite correct.
2013720	2021400	That means that a physicist looking at the object couldn't know the meaning of the word.
2022600	2029960	That means that the child, when it's learning the meaning of the word, is using all of this
2030600	2040040	intricate understanding in the mind, none of it presented as evidence. Furthermore, that's true
2040040	2047560	of every word in the language. Let's take an earlier example, pre-socratic, heraclitus,
2048520	2054280	ask a rather profound question. How can you cross the same river twice?
2054920	2062040	The second time you cross it, it's a physically different object. In fact, it could be radically
2062040	2072360	different. It could be flowing in the opposite direction. It could be not water, but arsenic
2072440	2086200	from an upstream plant. It could have been divided into several trihitoris. It could be like the
2086200	2094200	river I pass on the way to work here in Tucson, where I live, the Rolito River, which never has
2094200	2101400	any water in it. It's a dry bed, but it's the Rolito River, because every once in a while you
2101400	2108600	get a trickle of water through it. Historically, it was a river. It's a river. It's all the way
2108600	2118040	we conceive it. You could take the Rolito River, start using it for commuting to Tucson. It would
2118040	2126280	be a highway, not the river. Physically, it hasn't changed at all. That's, again, true of all the
2126280	2134840	words in our vocabulary. One special case of it is called polysomy. I suppose I say
2138360	2149480	the book is harder to understand than it is to burn. What's the book? It's simultaneously
2150280	2157160	abstract, because you can understand it and concrete, because you can burn it. The world
2157160	2163880	doesn't contain objects that are both concrete and abstract, but our mind constructs them.
2164840	2171480	And that's what the words of language are. And these are learned virtually without experience.
2172440	2179320	Another, this one is a real mystery. We don't know how that's done, but it's a fact that has to be
2179320	2187080	explained. Well, these are among the amazing things that you discover as soon as you begin
2187080	2196520	to look at the facts closely. One conclusion we have to draw is that language, what we call
2196520	2206040	language, has two completely separate components. One of them is an internal language that constructs
2206040	2215640	thoughts, has no order, no linear order, just abstract structures. The second part is a system
2215640	2224680	that externalizes it into one or another sensory motor, medium, usually sound, could be sign,
2225240	2235320	could even be touch. Notice that that second component is an amalgam of language and sensory
2235640	2242600	motor systems. It's not pure language. Sensory motor systems have nothing to do with language.
2243320	2250200	They were in place long before language emerged. They have not changed since language was
2251160	2258440	emerged in the evolutionary record. So there's something extraneous to language,
2259160	2267720	kind of like the printer that your laptop could be attached to. Well, and that of course has
2267720	2280120	linear order and does use adjacency and other things. Well, when you try to find explanations
2280120	2293000	for language, you, real explanations, you face a kind of conundrum. A trial learns language with
2293800	2301880	virtually no evidence. Actual statistical studies of the data available to children
2301880	2310040	show that it's very sparse, very little. And as I mentioned, they know things for which they have
2310040	2317800	no evidence at all, like structure dependence. So that makes it seem as though what's innate,
2317800	2327080	internal to the mind, must be very rich in order to carry the child from extremely limited data
2327720	2336440	to very rich possession of knowledge. So on the one hand, the learning, the internal structure
2336440	2344920	must be very rich. But then there's another problem. This system had to evolve. Well,
2346280	2356520	it evolved in a very brief period of time. We now know from genomic analysis that human beings began
2356520	2367240	to separate at least 150,000 years ago. And they all have the same faculty of language,
2367880	2374840	same possession of knowledge, of language, same possession of knowledge. So it was in place
2375560	2383800	before 150,000 years ago. Well, that's not long after humans emerged. As I said, humans emerge
2384520	2391640	maybe 200,000 to 300,000 years ago. That's a very narrow window in evolutionary time.
2394600	2402920	Click up an eye. Before humans emerged, there's no evidence in the archaeological record
2403480	2412680	for any kind of symbolic activity. After humans emerged pretty soon in evolutionary time,
2412680	2421960	you had very rich symbolic activity. Ordinarily assume plausibly that this is associated with the
2421960	2428840	emergence of language. Well, what that seems to mean is that the basic
2429880	2438440	faculty of language must be quite simple since it emerged so quickly in evolutionary time.
2439320	2448360	But now we have a conundrum looking at acquisition. Looks like the internal innate system must be
2448360	2458680	very rich. Looking at evolution seems like it must be very simple. I should say the first problem
2458680	2465240	acquisition is sometimes called Plato's problem. Plato did raise the question,
2465960	2473560	how can we know so much with so little evidence? Didn't really have an answer.
2475880	2483960	The second question is sometimes called Darwin's problem. How could we evolve such a system
2483960	2492520	so quickly? So it must be both very complex and very simple. There's a third problem,
2493080	2500520	whatever the faculty of language is, it has to be universal. It has to cover all languages,
2501160	2509000	because an infant has equal access to all of them. Well, it's this collection of problems that has
2509720	2521000	guided the inquiry into language for the last 60 or 70 years since the abandonment of the
2521640	2528600	behaviorist structural restrictions and the return to what had been the tradition.
2529480	2538600	And it seems that finally in the last few years we are getting to the point where we may have
2538600	2547560	answers to these questions. So that, if it were to the extent it works out, is actually a new era
2548280	2558920	in the long millennial long study of language. The first time when we can reach genuine explanations,
2559720	2569240	satisfying, answering Plato's problem, Darwin's problem, and the universality of the theory.
2569800	2578280	So let's look first at the universality. It seems recent research is increasingly
2580440	2587320	attending towards the conclusion that the diversity of language is in the externalization
2587400	2600040	and superficial things like choice of lexical, the way you, the sound you associate with a lexical
2600040	2612200	item. So it could be, you know, Cat in English, Cha in French, something else in some other language.
2613160	2619640	But that's superficial. That, of course, you can learn easily. But the concept, the
2620440	2627640	meaning of the word that's already inside. So one aspect of variety is just
2629320	2637240	association of sound and symbol. That's easy. There are others. There are many, the variety of
2637320	2644920	languages looks on the surface, very large. So there are some languages. English happens to be a
2644920	2652280	what's called a highly analytic language. Lots of simple words from one after the other to make
2652280	2658280	a sentence. There are other languages at the opposite extreme. A sentence could be one word.
2659240	2667800	And other words could be scattered around freely. Well, it's by now been learned over recent years
2667800	2673640	that these apparently radically different languages are almost identical
2674600	2681800	at the deeper level. They have the same internals, very much the same, maybe exactly the same
2681880	2689160	internal structure, the internal language, the one that generates thoughts looks as if it's
2690440	2696760	pretty much the same, maybe exactly the same, no matter how different the superficial appearance.
2697800	2705800	I think that's not too surprising. The internal language can't be learned. We have absolutely
2705800	2711320	almost no evidence for it. It's true of the meaning of words, true of things like structure,
2711880	2717800	dependence, other major properties of language. So it makes sense for it to be
2718520	2726680	identical among people or close to that. On the other hand, the externalization is not strictly
2726680	2733240	language. Remember, it's an amalgam of language and sensory motor systems,
2733880	2739880	which are totally divorced from language. Well, connecting these two things is
2740680	2746680	fairly complex process. Two things that have no relation to one another can be done in many
2746680	2755160	different ways. It's basically solving a hard cognitive problem. Different communities have
2755160	2761880	solved the problem in different ways. So it looks complex. It's a complex problem.
2762840	2770840	The internal language looks quite simple because it's based on very simple computational procedures.
2771640	2774920	So on the one hand, we solve the problem of
2776920	2783560	Darwin's problem. We have a very simple system. Solve the problem of
2783560	2793640	Plato's problem because the learning is all in the superficial part. The internal part just
2793640	2799880	isn't learned. It's just there, like structure, dependence, the ways of interpreting those sentences
2799880	2806440	that I gave. And the variety is where you expect it to be in the complex problem of
2807400	2814920	relating the internal language that produces thought to the external system that
2815960	2823000	translates, that hands it over to the printer that allows other people to read and see and
2823000	2830360	interpret it. To the extent that that can work out, you have genuine explanations.
2831080	2837000	Well, that carries us on to the next chapter. How has it worked out?
2838040	2845720	I'm going to give the barest hint of that here. So let's take the major principle of language,
2846760	2853000	structure, dependence. Pretty remarkable principle. I wasn't even noticed until
2853000	2863000	fairly recently in all the history of language. Again, the fact that all operations of the
2863000	2869400	internal language, not externalization, all operations of the internal language that generates
2869400	2877320	thought ignore linear order. There's no linear order there at all. Just abstract structures
2877320	2891000	created by the mind and somatic interpretations, like the ones for river, house, book, every word
2891000	2900120	you can think of, which are constructed by the mind. So let's take structure, dependence. How
2900120	2911320	can we account for this? Well, we have to show that when language evolved, it mother nature
2911960	2919400	hit upon the simplest possible combinatorial operation. The basic property of language,
2920200	2928120	all languages, is that each language is what you know, what's the knowledge possessed is
2928120	2936280	an infinite array of sentences, which are structured expressions, hierarchy of structures,
2936920	2945640	and can somehow be assigned an interpretation as a thought, and by the externalization system
2946280	2952200	mapped on to the printer sensory motor organs. That's the basic property.
2953160	2961480	It's property called recursive generation. You have to generate an infinite array of expressions.
2962200	2970840	Well, the understanding of how to do that developed really in the early part of the 20th
2970840	2980520	century, as the theory of computation was developed by leading mathematicians, Kurt Gertl,
2980600	2989320	Alan Turing, Alonzo Church, Emil Post, established the modern theory of computation,
2989960	3000680	which shows clearly how a finite object like your laptop or your brain can store within it programs
3001320	3011320	that can yield an infinite array of objects, expressions in our case, and do it in a way
3011320	3019880	which could be hooked up to a printer. That allows us to ask what are the operations that
3019880	3030520	mother nature would have hit upon as soon as some accident took place in the evolutionary record
3030760	3037720	a couple hundred thousand years ago, and the property of recursive generation somehow appeared.
3039080	3045000	What's the simplest way to deal with it? Well, the simplest computation happens to be
3045960	3053880	what's called binary set formation, forming a set out of two elements, not changing either of them.
3054840	3061960	You repeat that over and over again, you get hierarchic structures indefinitely.
3063480	3072840	So a plausible evolutionary scenario is some accident took place, maybe some small mutation
3073960	3082760	out of it came. A process of recursive generation mother nature then picked the simplest one,
3083640	3088200	binary set formation, what's called merge in the recent literature,
3088840	3094840	and then everything flowed from that. Structure dependence flows from it immediately.
3096280	3103000	Many other properties do as well, where you can show that that's the case, you have a genuine
3103000	3109240	explanation. Notice incidentally that this is the way evolution works generally.
3109240	3122360	Evolution goes through all evolution, goes through three, I see a half of the question, but I can't
3122360	3136360	read it. Okay, could you just hold it for a second, we'll come later. The way evolution works is
3137320	3147560	three steps. First, some accident takes place, could be a mutation, cosmic ray passed by and
3148280	3157320	changed the DNA slightly, an accident. It could be what's called symbiosis. So if you go back
3158280	3166600	a couple hundred million years, it turned out that a bacterium, there were only bacteria and
3166600	3176200	similar microorganisms at the time, one bacterium by accident swallowed another microorganism
3177400	3183800	that led to the development of what are called eukaryotic cells, complex cells,
3184520	3194120	the basis for complex life, our life for example. The third step is winnowing of the various
3194120	3202440	things constructed in the second step, which ones have better reproductive capacity, that's
3202440	3212040	natural selection, those are the ones that survive. So it seems to be the way language
3212040	3220280	developed. First came some accident, maybe a mutation, which yielded recursive generation,
3221080	3228200	then other nature comes along, tries to find the most elegant solution to the problem of
3228200	3235720	how to deal with these new systems. In one case it was eukaryotic cells, in our case it was
3236120	3243960	a generation by merge. The winning stage apparently never came for language,
3244840	3250840	there's no winnowing stage or what we stayed the same, maybe because time just
3252120	3258920	hasn't been long enough for natural selection to operate, maybe it's because at the second
3259480	3267640	elegant stage the system was so closely integrated that you just can't change it or it falls
3267640	3275880	apart. That would be a very interesting discovery and research is tending in the direction of
3275880	3284280	showing that it's correct. Well time is running out, let me stop here, we're now reaching what would
3284280	3293320	be the next chapter. How does all this work out in detail? But I think maybe if this succeeded you
3293320	3301560	have a general picture of how we can hope to meet the Galilean challenge, the basic challenge in the
3302200	3311160	history of the study of language in mind and do it in a way which can give genuine explanations
3311160	3319640	for some quite remarkable properties of language and thought while leaving identifying
3319640	3326680	other properties as a total mystery which we simply cannot comprehend. That seems to me
3326680	3338840	pretty much where we stand today, I'll stop there. Thank you Noam, can you hear me okay?
3339800	3346360	Great, so we'll have actually asked people to raise their hands for questions, I think it
3346360	3351640	will be easier to moderate them but we did have a couple come in through chat and maybe
3352760	3359960	we can start there. Leslie Bailey if you want to unmute yourself and ask your question go ahead.
3361560	3368040	Oh great, okay I'm afraid this is a really really stupid question Noam, I'm sorry. If possible
3368040	3374680	please restate the difference between the behavioral structural approach to language and
3374680	3380840	what replaced it and how that transition occurred. I mean I know it's very complicated but if you
3380840	3387080	could just say it in two sentences. It's quite interesting, let's take a look at how the
3387880	3395480	structural linguists identified their own theory, their words. Structural linguistics
3396040	3404200	was identified by mid 20th century, a consensus had been reached among the at that time
3404840	3410840	fairly small number of structural linguists, it was a very small field then, a huge field now.
3411640	3417880	The small, they reached the consensus that structural linguistics was what they called
3417880	3427000	a taxonomic science. There were procedures of analysis, I was actually a student in the late
3427000	3434520	40s studying this. You studied the procedures of analysis, here's what you do when you have an
3434520	3444040	informant from a say Native American community, here are the procedures you use, of all you have
3444040	3450120	as a text, here's the procedures of analysis you use, those procedures identify units,
3450760	3456920	you organize the units, you're done. It's a taxonomic science, fields over.
3457800	3466040	Okay so it's descriptive. Let me continue. There was also a theory of learning. It was
3466040	3474440	stated explicitly by Leonard Bloomfield, the leading linguist, American linguist of the
3474440	3482840	early 20th century. Language in his words is a matter of training and habit. If there's anything
3482840	3491800	new produced, it's by analogy. Same view in philosophy of language. Take the major figures,
3492760	3502120	W.E. Quine, Ludwig Wittgenstein, essentially the same. Language is a matter of training,
3503320	3510440	habit, your Quine, Schenarian, operant conditioning, anything new is analogy.
3512280	3520360	The new system that developed starting around the 20th century was essentially a return to the
3520360	3528680	old tradition. We want to find explanations for linguistic phenomena. We want to find out why
3528680	3539400	they work this way, not the other way. Why do we say the bombing of the cities is a crime, not
3539400	3546840	or a crime? Essentially the 17th century questions. As soon as you started on that, you had the same
3547800	3554920	transition that happened in the 17th century from knowing everything to knowing nothing.
3555880	3562440	As soon as you started asking these questions, turned out you had no answer. Well, I should say
3562440	3570280	that the entire tradition was totally unknown, completely forgotten, wasn't rediscovered until
3570280	3577400	the 1960s after much of the ground had already been laid. The structuralist behaviors
3578120	3585800	era essentially wiped out the history. But the new system that I've been discussing is
3586680	3591320	essentially picking up from what the tradition was. I don't know if that's
3591960	3596360	clear enough to answer the question. No, that's great. Thank you so much.
3597080	3603400	All right, so our next question is from David Dalton. David, I just unmuted you, so you should
3603400	3611000	be able to ask your question. Listen to our discussion here, and I ask, is not our consideration
3611000	3617960	a little bit Anglo-centric in that English, yes, it has an alphabet of 26 characters,
3618600	3624520	but if you look at Mandarin, it has an alphabet of 40,000 characters, only 2,000 of which are
3624600	3631320	stand today. Not to mention that, Mandarin is a tonal language, whereas English is more of a
3631320	3639880	literal language. And I don't know Mandarin myself, but I just wonder how is it that we can, with such
3639880	3647320	broad brush strokes, compare all of language in this discussion, I would seem that there would be
3647400	3655400	quite a bit of difference in the semantics of Mandarin versus English or say German or French.
3656840	3663560	Well, I think the comment about the alphabet that I made was Galileo. He was, of course,
3663560	3672680	thinking of Latin and Greek, but the alphabet is a very superficial matter. It's like the printer.
3672680	3680280	You can use all sorts of alphabets. You can use the Mandarin style, the Korean style,
3681640	3689800	hieroglyphs, just as you can use any printer. It turns out that the internal system for Mandarin,
3690600	3702360	for English, for Youkuts, for Paraguay, for Tagalog, the internal systems are very much the same,
3702360	3709320	maybe identical. Lots of languages are tonal languages, but they function essentially. That's
3709320	3717880	just a different printer. And I mentioned just one example when I was talking. Languages like
3718600	3728360	Youkuts is an example where a single word includes the whole sentence. It was thought for a long time
3728360	3734920	that those languages must be very different. The more we discover, the more we find that
3734920	3742920	at the internal level, they're the same. The internal means for constructing expressions
3743000	3749640	and the semantics is either identical or very close to it. It doesn't look like that on the
3749640	3756600	surface. You're quite right. On the surface, they look wildly different. And it was assumed,
3756600	3766680	if you go back 50 years, it was assumed that languages can differ in just about every possible
3766680	3773720	way. And when you study a particular language, you can't use any presuppositions from another
3773720	3781240	language. That was sometimes called the Boazian principle. That's what I learned when I was a
3781240	3790520	student. It seems to be completely wrong. It seems that at the core, all languages are either
3791080	3798920	identical or very close to it. The systems that construct internal expressions in the mind,
3799800	3807720	expressions of thought don't seem to differ. The externalization looks very different.
3808520	3817640	They seem arranged differently, different sounds, and so on. But all of that seems superficial.
3818360	3827560	To go back to the analogy of the laptop and the printer, what's the internal program in the laptop
3828520	3835720	seems pretty close to common for all languages that we know, including very diverse ones.
3836440	3842680	The printer can be very different. And the alphabet isn't even the printer. It's not the
3842680	3847960	sounds. It's the representation of the sounds. So it's even more remote from language.
3851320	3855640	Our next question is from Fran Manley. Fran, if you want to unmute yourself or I've
3855640	3859880	unmuted you actually, Fran, you're good to go. Yeah, I got a two-part question, professor.
3859880	3864520	One, is there any evidence as to whether or not other species, for example, like dogs,
3865240	3871160	have a common language which allows them to communicate even with dogs they don't know?
3871880	3876440	And my second question, if I may, is on children, I've been led to believe that
3876440	3881880	children don't use a word unless they've heard it. But I got the impression from what you've said
3881880	3887080	that's not necessarily so. They don't have to hear a word to learn it. Okay, thank you.
3888280	3894120	Well, on the second one, children have to hear a word in order to not,
3894120	3899160	not to, depends on what you mean by learn the word. They know the meaning of the word
3899720	3909320	before they hear what the sounds are. So if you're a Chinese child, a Pottawatomie child,
3910120	3916920	French child, whatever it may be, you have the meaning in your head. You don't know what sound
3916920	3923800	is going to be associated with it. That you have to hear. And Lauderdale Gleitman and
3924520	3930120	her work and others have shown that takes almost no, no, no experience.
3931000	3937480	Couple here at a couple of times and you say, okay, that's the internal word that I know with
3937480	3943800	all of its complex meaning. You do have to hear something to know whether it's pronounced cat
3943800	3949480	or some other way. Okay, how about the animals? Do they have one language, form of language, other
3949480	3959240	species? Do they have more? Do they have, do like, do animals or do other species have their own
3959240	3967160	communication? Yeah. So animals, let's say dogs, I happen to have two of them on the desk at the
3967160	3973560	moment. You heard a couple of them before. Well, I've looked at them pretty carefully.
3974520	3982840	They were, they have a number of ideas in their heads, maybe a dozen or so.
3984360	3991160	Sometimes they can do moderately complicated things. Like, I'll give you my favorite example.
3991960	4000360	There's a big dog and a small dog. If the big dog wants to be taken, I hate to say the words
4000360	4006200	because unfortunately, she'll hear them, but wants to be extricated to the outdoors,
4007480	4013960	power phrase, which she doesn't understand. When she wants that, she has a trick to do it.
4014680	4021320	She takes something away from the small dog and the small dog comes over to us to complain.
4022520	4028680	And we make the big dog, give it, say a toy, give it back to the small dog, and then she
4028680	4036920	runs right to the door and expects us to extricate her. Okay. So it's more of a behavior than a
4036920	4046520	language, right? It's a small number of things. It's an entirely different from human language in
4046520	4054760	every respect. Every animal that's known, including the closest to us, apes, monkeys,
4055720	4066040	or have symbols, like take a vervet monkey, which has been studied carefully, has maybe a dozen
4066040	4075400	calls. Like, if the leaves are fluttering in a tree, the vervet monkey will come out with a sound
4076440	4083640	which makes all the other monkeys run away and hide. We interpret that as a warning sound.
4084200	4088920	Maybe there's an eagle in the tree or something. I don't know what the monkey's thinking. But
4090920	4098120	every, or can make another symbol, which is, we interpret as meaning, I'm hungry. Okay.
4099480	4108440	The point is that each symbol is keyed explicitly to a physically identifiable entity.
4108440	4117880	The motion of leaves in a tree, hormonal changes, something like that. Okay. Thank you.
4117880	4125080	And none of the, none of the human symbols are like that. That's Aristotle's point about house.
4125720	4131640	So they're radically different. Furthermore, there's no combinatorial structure in the
4132200	4141240	animal systems. It's just a symbol. Now, there have been major efforts to try to train chimpanzees
4142120	4151640	like infants. The main study you may have seen, it is called the NIMM study, named after me, actually,
4152440	4159400	by a number of very fine cognitive scientists, some of them former students. Now, one of them
4159400	4167720	a colleague and friend, they made an extensive effort to raise the chimpanzee NIMM from infancy
4168920	4179320	pretty much the way you raise an infant, extensive efforts to get NIMM to pick up something like
4179320	4190520	language. They used sign because the articulatory system for the chimpanzee doesn't work very well.
4191240	4197160	So train it like an infant would learn sign. At first, they thought they were getting somewhere,
4197720	4204280	but when they looked closely, it turned out it was nothing. It's just beyond the capacity
4204920	4212280	of a highly intelligent ape to do anything like what a one- and two-year-old infant does.
4212280	4218040	They're just built differently. There are things that other organisms do that we can't do,
4218840	4225480	like I live in the desert. In the back of my house, there are desert ants who have cognitive
4225480	4233160	capacities that I can't come close to. They can navigate in ways which I can't possibly do,
4233160	4239240	maybe humans can duplicate it with complicated instruments, and they have a brain about the size
4239240	4248280	of a miniscule brain. Organisms are just different. Our difference is we have the capacity for language.
4248840	4252440	It doesn't have any counterpart anywhere. No.
4257080	4261640	Our next question is from Les. I've unmuted you, Les, so go ahead and ask.
4261880	4271000	Yeah, this question is maybe more philosophical, but the idea about thought and expression,
4271880	4281720	can you have thoughts before expression internally, or do they rise simultaneously and cannot exist independently?
4284520	4291240	Well, these are things where we can't introspect because it's all beyond the level of
4291240	4298760	introspection, and there's no external scientific evidence. But the simplest theory,
4299480	4306360	the simplest assumption, the one that would have to be disproved, is that they're just the same thing.
4307560	4317080	The expression is the thought. There's an internal system which has provided we all have
4317960	4327800	the knowledge we possess, includes an infinite array of these thoughts formulated in the linguistic
4327800	4338440	system. When I produce a sentence, I pick out one of them somehow, how unknown, then I implement it.
4338440	4347080	So there may be no distinction between thought and expression, no first or second.
4348680	4354920	Just that's what the thoughts are. There's a repository of thoughts in linguistic form,
4355720	4361480	and we can then implement them. And on the receptive side, you can reconstruct them.
4362440	4368920	Maybe not the same way, maybe even in a different language, but something very much like them.
4372280	4376040	Our next question is Joe Keller. Go ahead, Joe. I've unmuted you.
4377880	4384440	Thank you, Scott. Professor, as the newly conceived human begins to develop her that
4384440	4391400	inborn language structure, will her external experiences add to or enhance that structure in
4391400	4400200	any way? Well, here we ought to pay attention to the way built-in structures work generally
4401400	4407480	to take your visual system. The visual system does quite complicated things,
4408440	4416040	very, there's time to talk about them, but very rich things. If your visual system is not
4416840	4425320	stimulated in the early weeks of life, it'll degenerate. We know this from studies with
4425880	4433560	other animals, cats, monkeys, and so on, in basis that we live about the same visual system.
4434440	4440680	It's shown that unless a kitten is presented with pattern stimulation
4441560	4447800	in the first couple of weeks of life, it'll be blind. That's the way
4448600	4454920	and all instinctive behavior works like that. It has to be triggered by something,
4455000	4463640	and then it is partially shaped, partially shaped by the way, by the stimulation.
4464280	4472440	So it takes kittens again. If kittens are presented in the early weeks of life only with
4473080	4482440	horizontal lines, then as a mature cat, it'll be able to perceive horizontal lines,
4482440	4488440	not vertical lines. That's a little bit like different learning, different languages.
4489240	4496600	You can shape the internal system marginally. You can't train a kitten to recognize
4498120	4503480	curves, for example, in infancy. It has to be lines and different orientations.
4505160	4512200	Lots of things can't get it to do, and that's the way instinctive behavior works quite generally.
4512200	4518600	It seems to be the same with language as far as we know. The system is built in, the internal system
4519560	4528120	has to be triggered in order to get started, to develop, then pretty much develops on its own
4528120	4536200	course. There are some respects in which experience outside data shapes the system.
4537080	4545240	One is the trivial one of how do you pronounce this? Others are, are you going to be like
4546200	4551960	English, an analytic language with a lot of separate words that form a sentence?
4552680	4560200	Or are you going to be like, let's say, a language where you have one huge word that
4560200	4570040	includes everything? Well, that requires some stimulation. A large part of recent research,
4570040	4578120	very recent research, is to try to sort out which parts are fixed and fundamental,
4579000	4587640	which parts are provided by the shaping expective experience. It's turned out pretty surprising.
4588440	4598280	So 40 or 50 years ago, the greatest anthropological linguists, friends of all of us here,
4599160	4605560	Ken Hale, former teacher's friend, one of the leading anthropological and
4606520	4614440	formal linguists of the past generation, he firmly believed that languages differed in
4615400	4623000	what's called a parameter, an option of choices. Some had flat structure with no hierarchy,
4623560	4631560	some like English had hierarchy. And it looked, that's the way the evidence looked. Over time,
4632200	4641320	actually Ken, Ken Hale and his students, Julie Legge, were able to show that even the most extreme
4641320	4648760	cases of languages that looked like completely free word order or flat no structure, even they
4648760	4655240	had the same internal structure as the hierarchical languages. These are real discoveries, major
4655240	4662760	discoveries of the past couple of decades. And we don't know how far it'll go, but I think it's
4662760	4670040	a reasonable guess by now that it'll probably go to showing that the internal system that generates
4670040	4677640	thought is either uniform or very close to it, and that the apparent variety and complexity
4678360	4684440	and mutability, the change from generation to generation, all of that's probably in the
4684440	4691480	externalization and the trivial lexical properties, like do you pronounce it cat or some other way.
4691880	4698680	Our next question is Miriam Burt. Miriam, you are unmuted, go ahead.
4699480	4704760	Thank you. I think my question, Professor, probably follows on pretty well to the recent one,
4704760	4712600	the one you just responded to. You said earlier that around two years to 30 months is this riot,
4712600	4719880	this wonderful time when, you know, they're learning a new word or a new every waking hours.
4719960	4727720	But I wonder if a child, if she's deprived of both that visual stimulation and the language,
4727720	4732680	you know, the auditory to hear the words from, because she's in an orphanage or, you know, in a
4732680	4741080	very poverty state, if you will, you know, for external stimuli. Will she be able to catch up
4741720	4748920	if she is subsequently, you know, exposed to this, this stimuli, you know, internally and
4748920	4753880	externally, I mean, visually and auditorially, or is she always going to be a little behind
4753880	4762680	and not quite up to what she could be. Thank you. That's a very, it's a very difficult question,
4762680	4773080	because we cannot do experiments. You don't do experiments with humans. Rightly or wrongly,
4773080	4780360	we do do them with cats and monkeys. That's how we know about the visual system, which is pretty
4780360	4786200	much shared with us. Can't do it with any other organism, because no other organism with anything
4786280	4794520	remotely like language. So we just have to look at the experiences that we see. And they're,
4796200	4803560	they're very interesting. You learn a lot from them. So there's a very fine neuroscientist
4804520	4813240	named Helen Neville, Oregon State University, who done fine work on the brain and language.
4813720	4819560	Actually, about 30 years ago, she got interested in pretty much this question.
4820520	4831480	She took children who are what are called low SES, socioeconomic status, and who seemed to be
4832040	4837240	problems in school. They weren't learning. They couldn't speak to all kind of behavioral and
4837240	4844040	other problems. And she began to study them carefully. She noticed some interesting things.
4844760	4853160	Their parents don't talk to them. I mean, they say, get out or go outside or leave me alone.
4853160	4859320	And not because they're bad people, they're just people who are trying to survive on two jobs in
4859320	4865640	miserable circumstances. Parents never read them stories. You know, they've never had that experience.
4866280	4872360	So she tried a simple experiment, trying to bring the parents and the children together
4873240	4882360	and encourage them just in some free time to interact, like have a mother read a story to
4882360	4889880	the children, things like that. Turned out they enjoyed it. They did more of it. They started
4889960	4895640	having much higher cognitive achievements. Weren't problems in schools and so on.
4897080	4902440	Well, that's a partial answer to your question. I'll mention another real experiment,
4903640	4911400	real event. It's a very fine, another cognitive neuroscientist to come and Massimo know very well.
4912360	4922280	He lives in Massachusetts. He began working with children who were such extreme behavior problems
4922280	4929240	that they were basically excluded from school. They couldn't stay in a classroom, had to be
4929240	4937640	excluded. He started working with them, looking at them carefully. He immediately found out
4937640	4945000	that these were kids who came from homes where they didn't eat breakfast. They didn't eat breakfast.
4945000	4951160	They got on a school bus. The bus roamed around for an hour. They finally got to the school.
4951800	4958200	They were out of their heads. They were sent to maybe an arithmetic class.
4959160	4963560	Here they couldn't pay any attention. They ran around the room and so on.
4964120	4969720	Well, he started doing something. For one thing, when they came to school, the first thing he did
4969720	4977240	was give them candy because their glucose levels were low. They hadn't eaten. Then,
4977240	4983160	instead of putting them right in an arithmetic class, he let them stay outside and run around
4983160	4990120	for half an hour. Then they brought them into school. Other things like that. By now, these kids
4990120	4996440	are performing considerably better than the average in the public school system.
4997560	5005800	Well, I think that's the kind of evidence that we have about your question. It's a humanly,
5005800	5012440	very significant question. We can't do direct experiments on it. We're not going to deprive
5012440	5017880	children and see what happens. You take the natural experiments and see what you can find out.
5018680	5025320	I think the basic answer is that if the deprivation is not too severe,
5026280	5033640	the child can probably recover normal cognitive capacity. If the deprivation is extremely
5033640	5040440	severe and there are such cases, the child is simply deprived of external contact,
5041080	5048360	maybe a sociopathic father, something like that, then they may never recover.
5048360	5053480	But it's hard to know what's caused. There's a famous case, Jeanne, which you may have read
5053480	5061320	about, but it's hard to know what the lack of recovery is from because any kid like that is
5061320	5068920	going to be psychotic. If you're brought up, tied to a chair till you're 12 years old with somebody
5069000	5075880	throwing food at you, you're going to be psychotic if you can even survive. So how much is that
5075880	5083080	interfering with what's happening? Well, we don't know and we don't want to do the experiments,
5083080	5092360	which will answer it. We've got about five minutes left. Our next question is from Linda Green.
5092360	5101080	Linda, you are unmuted. Go ahead. My question has to do with brain research.
5101080	5106600	What contemporary brain research is shedding light on linguistics?
5108520	5116120	Well, it's difficult because brain research altogether is very difficult and brain research
5116200	5124040	on humans is particularly difficult because we do not allow invasive experiments.
5125800	5134360	With a cat, we allow ourselves to stick an electrode into a neuron and see what it's doing.
5135400	5143080	You don't do that with humans. So it's all kind of evidence you can pick up by external
5144040	5149960	imaging and so on. And you can learn a great deal. In fact, the most important discovery
5150600	5156520	about this actually has to do with what I call structure dependence, the fact that
5157480	5166440	the computational operations of language make no use of 100% of what we hear, words in linear order.
5166520	5169640	They only deal with abstract structures in the mind.
5171000	5177240	They're very ingenious experiments initiated by a friend and colleague of ours,
5177880	5187880	Andrea Moro, Italian linguist, neuroscientist. He and his colleagues devised experiments on
5187880	5197480	the following paradigm. They took subjects, two groups of subjects who happened to be
5197480	5207240	speakers of German and presented them with invented systems. One of them modeled on
5209160	5216840	Japanese language that they'd never heard. Another, using simple rules which violated
5216840	5225960	structure dependency. So a rule that says, if you want to negate a sentence, take the negative
5225960	5232600	particle, say not, and make it the third word of the sentence. Very trivial computation.
5233720	5240040	They asked how subjects responded to this. Well, it turned out that when they were given a language
5240760	5250520	modeled on a natural language, the areas of the brain that are mostly involved in language
5250520	5258120	processing and use all fired up the way you'd expect them to. When they were given the system,
5259160	5267080	the artificial system with simple computations on linear order, they just got diffuse activity
5267080	5275080	in the brain, meaning the brain is treating it as a puzzle, not a language. That's quite an
5275080	5281400	interesting result, certain replicated, there's different variants of it and so on. But that's
5281400	5288600	the kind of thing that can be done. There are other, there is other experimental work in
5288600	5296920	neuro linguistics which shows a number of things. All right, we probably have one quick
5296920	5302360	question, Ralph Losty, if you'd like to, I've got you on muted Ralph, if you'd like to ask your
5302360	5310760	question. Yes, I just read recently about the multi-language brain. And it looks like people
5310760	5321240	with multi-language capabilities are actually perform worse than mono-language brain. And how
5321240	5328040	could that be when you said the languages are the universe? So the thoughts of being universal
5328840	5337000	and they should express, okay. Well, first, I don't know what you saw, but I don't believe it.
5337960	5346840	Every child is easily capable of learning many languages in infancy. It's very common in many
5346840	5354040	cultures for a child to know three or four languages. They don't even know their different
5354040	5359560	languages. This is the way you talk to your mother, this is the way you talk to your grandfather,
5360280	5366280	this is the way you talk to the kids in the street. Finally, at some age, maybe four or five,
5366280	5373160	they may realize, hey, I'm speaking different languages. But it's just normal. As far as we
5373160	5381400	know, every child can do that. There's no known difference between, there's no even any way of
5381400	5390280	studying it, because all children have this multi-language capacity. But I'd be very skeptical
5390280	5398040	about the source you looked at, frankly. Thank you so much. Well, I think that's all the time we
5398040	5405160	have today that Professor Chomsky, we really appreciate having you present to us. And I'm
5405160	5409560	grateful to know as I, when I was a child, and I probably begged for a candy for breakfast that
5409560	5417960	it wasn't a bad thing. But no, I, we really appreciate you being here. And again, thank the
5417960	5424120	Department of Linguistics at the University of Arizona for hosting this session and course,
5424120	5428280	and appreciate it so much. Do you have any other parting words for us, sir?
5431080	5436520	I hope some of you will be interested enough to look into the meat of the subject,
5436520	5444120	how it's actually done next chapter. We did have a few people inquiring about
5445080	5450360	the publications and things that would be of good service to kind of get a general
5450360	5453400	understanding of this area of study. What are your recommendations?
5455720	5464040	Well, I have a book called What Kind of Creatures Are We, which goes into many of these questions.
5464280	5471800	But there's a lot more work. They're very, I should say, they're excellent general introductions
5472360	5482680	to language. There's a book by Charles Yang called The Infinite Gift, which
5484120	5490680	focuses a lot on acquisition, but brings up these things. There's a recent book by
5491400	5500120	David Adger, A-D-G-E-R. I think it's called something like The Infinite Mind or something
5500120	5506920	like that, which is an excellent introductory discussion at a high level to many of us.
5509240	5516760	There's a very fine general introduction to many aspects of language by an outstanding
5516760	5525400	linguist, Ian Roberts. It's called The Wonders of Language, which goes into these and many other
5525400	5534360	things. There's a lot of very high-level introductory literature for syntax, the kind
5534360	5541880	of thing I'm talking about. Our colleague here, Andrew Carney, has a book simply called Syntax,
5541880	5549400	which goes into many of these things in a very lucid way, but in considerable detail.
5552520	5559960	Well, thank you again so much. We really appreciate it. I can't unmute everybody apparently.
5559960	5571640	Thank you. Thank you. Thank you so much. Absolutely outstanding. Thank you so much.
5573240	5583160	Thank you, Professor. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, fabulous. Thank you.
5589960	5593160	Thank you.
