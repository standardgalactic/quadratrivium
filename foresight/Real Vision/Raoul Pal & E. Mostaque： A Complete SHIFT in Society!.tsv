0	4000	As you know, I have a thesis about the exponential age
4000	7000	that we're about to go through the fastest pace of technology
7000	9000	the world has ever seen.
9000	11000	That's what this whole series is about.
11000	14000	This next interview with an old friend of mine
14000	18000	is probably one of the most important single interviews
18000	20000	you will watch.
20000	24000	I can't stress enough how important the concepts
24000	26000	and what is happening and the speed of which
26000	29000	artificial intelligence is going to change humanity.
29000	33000	It is something that we all need to pay attention to,
33000	37000	understand and use in our favour because it's happening
37000	40000	and it's happening at a scale of which you cannot comprehend.
43000	45000	Emma, fantastic you see you back on Real Vision.
45000	47000	Good to be back. Thanks for having me.
49000	52000	You were known in the past in various guises on Real Vision
52000	55000	because this is not your first rodeo.
55000	58000	You were the frontier guy
58000	61000	and we're going to talk about a new frontier today
61000	64000	and then also in the pandemic you helped guide us
64000	66000	through some of that too.
66000	68000	Give people a bit about your background
68000	70000	because it's a fascinating background
70000	72000	and it's an interesting journey to where you are today.
72000	75000	Yeah, it has been a few different skins.
75000	77000	I was a hedge fund manager
77000	79000	at the start of my career running Global Macro
79000	82000	then switched to emerging markets, frontier markets
82000	84000	and tech.
84000	86000	At one point I was one of the larger video game investors
86000	88000	which is also quite fun.
88000	91000	Took a bit of a break when my son was diagnosed with autism
91000	94000	and I used artificial intelligence to re-put up his drugs
94000	96000	to make him it better.
96000	98000	Well advised him some top hedge fund managers
98000	101000	and governments on various things including counter extremism
101000	103000	and fun things like that.
103000	106000	Went back to being a hedge fund manager, did okay
106000	108000	and then had a look at the world.
108000	111000	What we do as fund managers is we look for arbitrage opportunities
111000	114000	and we look for where things are building up and breaking down
114000	116000	and it struck me that a lot of stuff was breaking down.
116000	120000	I decided like let's try and make it better effectively
120000	122000	by combining some of these systems
122000	124000	and some of these arbitrage opportunities.
124000	126000	So one of the big things was education.
126000	130000	Another big thing was leading the United Nations
130000	132000	AI initiative against COVID-19.
132000	134000	I think the last time I was on Real Vision
134000	137000	was February this thick, 2020
137000	140000	and we had a nice chat about how the world was going to change
140000	142000	dramatically and it did
142000	144000	and then I was like oh crap I have to do something about it.
144000	147000	So we made all the COVID research in the world free
147000	150000	and pushed that and then I was lead architect of Kayak
150000	154000	which was the UNESCO World Bank WHO backed initiatives
154000	157000	to use artificial intelligence to take all that knowledge
157000	160000	and compress it down to reports for policymakers
160000	162000	so that we can be a bit more coordinated.
162000	165000	Similar to how we take all that information and fund management
165000	168000	compress it down and try to figure out those key drivers.
168000	171000	It was a mixed success but I think it did some difference
171000	174000	and now from that something a bit bigger
174000	177000	which is AI for everything basically.
177000	180000	So AI has clearly now become your thing, right?
180000	182000	This is your focus.
182000	185000	So before we get into what you're doing now
185000	188000	what the hell gave a hedge fund manager
188000	192000	the thought process that hey I can help the WHO
192000	195000	and everybody else with artificial intelligence?
195000	197000	Well it's because to be a hedge fund manager
197000	199000	you have to be a bit of an egomaniac, right?
199000	202000	I know that you're right and everybody else is kind of wrong.
202000	206000	Look I mean all of what we do is information classification
206000	208000	and that's the nature of artificial intelligence.
208000	211000	So information comes in and then Claude Shannon
211000	213000	style of information theory.
213000	215000	Information is only valuable as much as the change in the state
215000	217000	so you're always looking for something on that graph
217000	219000	or that new thing that will cause you to change
219000	221000	from a buy to a sell or an increase or decrease
221000	223000	in your positioning, right?
223000	225000	I kind of realized over the years though
225000	228000	like my background was mathematics, computer science originally
228000	230000	quite quantitative, quite analytical.
230000	234000	The next wave of AI was something a bit different
234000	236000	that would enable us to do something a bit different
236000	239000	because we moved from this big data age, you know
239000	241000	where you had massive amounts of information
241000	243000	and extrapolated it and targeted it to kind of sell
243000	246000	Raoul some suntan or whatever, you know?
246000	248000	To something a bit different, a big model
248000	250000	You're jealous of my tan.
250000	252000	I'm jealous of your tan.
252000	254000	I'm in London, you're in Cayman Island, I'm turning pasty.
254000	256000	Completely.
256000	258000	I have to fly out there too.
258000	260000	So moving from that area was about extrapolation
260000	263000	in the individual to something new in 2017
263000	265000	which was a big model age.
265000	268000	AI went from being able just to extrapolation
268000	270000	to being able to pay attention.
270000	272000	In fact, there was a seminal paper called
272000	275000	attention is all you need about how to build an AI
275000	277000	that paid attention to the most important parts of a sentence
277000	279000	the most important parts of an image
279000	282000	to do principle based analysis
282000	284000	which is insane if you think about it
284000	286000	this is exactly what we do, right?
286000	288000	What do you mean by principle based analysis?
288000	290000	Sorry.
290000	292000	So rather than doing extrapolation
292000	294000	so rather than doing momentum, beta
294000	297000	AI became able to do alpha
297000	300000	it became able to basically come up with principles
300000	302000	that allowed it to understand
302000	304000	the hidden layers of meaning
304000	306000	with things.
306000	308000	So you can go into a bit more detail
308000	310000	but this is how the human brain works, right?
310000	312000	We have two parts of our brain
312000	314000	which is like the past
314000	316000	and that's a tiger over there
316000	318000	in that bush, right?
318000	320000	It's the type one type two kind of thinking
320000	322000	so AI was always the extrapolation
322000	324000	and now we have a new type of AI
324000	326000	that mimics the human brain
326000	328000	by figuring out principles
328000	330000	from highly structured data
330000	332000	which is kind of what we did every single day
332000	334000	as the finance guys, right?
334000	336000	But at a completely different scale
336000	338000	I don't think even now people have appreciated
338000	340000	how big a change that's going to be
340000	342000	I think we're starting to figure that out now.
342000	344000	So
344000	346000	before we get into the guts of this
346000	348000	let's go on a bit of the journey
348000	350000	of AI
350000	352000	because you've talked about where it was
352000	354000	and then we started to see stuff like
354000	356000	DeepMind
356000	358000	and then GPT-3
358000	360000	OpenAI, all of this.
360000	362000	So if you can just frame it for people
362000	364000	because a lot of this is going to be new for people
364000	366000	and I think it's incredibly important
366000	368000	people understand what's happening
368000	370000	and where the hell of this is going.
370000	372000	Yeah, so if you look at DeepMind
372000	374000	they are famous for
374000	376000	many things, you know, Demos has done
376000	378000	a fantastic job.
378000	380000	One of the things they did is
380000	382000	thinking back, you had Gary Kasparov
382000	384000	being beaten by Deep Blue
384000	386000	so you know, as older fellows we remember that
386000	388000	not like the younger with the snapkins
388000	390000	who'd never seen a bear market in their lives
390000	392000	you know, kind of changes happening
392000	394000	what Deep Blue did was
394000	396000	it did an analysis of every single game
396000	398000	in the past and then extrapolated
398000	400000	and then it brute-forced it.
400000	402000	So Gary could only think X moves in the future
402000	404000	he could think X plus 2, X plus 3
404000	406000	and that's how he got beaten by brute-force.
406000	408000	Now, the Chinese game of Go
408000	410000	Chinese checkers, effectively
410000	412000	people thought you'd never be able to brute-force it
412000	414000	because there's too many things that you can do
414000	416000	there's too many moves on that board, right?
416000	418000	And so they were like,
418000	420000	that'll never be beaten by computer
420000	422000	because you need to build a computer that's
422000	424000	the biggest computer ever
424000	426000	times a million.
426000	428000	What DeepMind did
428000	430000	is that basically they came up with
430000	432000	a self-supervised learning algorithm
432000	434000	that
434000	436000	learned how to dream
436000	438000	that's probably the best way to kind of put it
438000	440000	about how one would play
440000	442000	Go in a principled way
442000	444000	so it didn't even have
444000	446000	all the past games in its memory
446000	448000	it just played against itself and tried to figure out
448000	450000	how to do this. They made a whole base of these
450000	452000	agents with reinforcement learning
452000	454000	that you gave it an Atari with no instructions
454000	456000	that learned how to play Breakout
456000	458000	and then Starcraft
458000	460000	without any instructions
460000	462000	people need to understand that, they figured it out
462000	464000	you put it in front of the computer
464000	466000	and it just figures it out and it gets better and better
466000	468000	so when you see it playing Breakout
468000	470000	it's suddenly doing these crazy moves like that
470000	472000	and so Lisa Doll was like a seventh Dan
472000	474000	in Go
474000	476000	so she was a Magnus Carlson
476000	478000	of Go effectively
478000	480000	and it wasn't a current Magnus Carlson
480000	482000	type situation, it's very difficult to cheat in Go
482000	484000	because you didn't have to be able to talk to you
484000	486000	we're not talking about anal probes in this one
486000	488000	we're talking about
488000	490000	compensation is going pretty well
490000	492000	so what happened is
492000	494000	that the next highest person
494000	496000	was like a fourth Dan or something
496000	498000	so he's like Federer Carlson rolled into one
498000	500000	that much better, I was like never beat him
500000	502000	he won one game
502000	504000	the computer won seven
504000	506000	and everyone was like holy crap
506000	508000	what is that, because computer learned to play
508000	510000	in a completely different way
510000	512000	and it was like it was playing with an alien
512000	514000	because it didn't learn past games
516000	518000	as you said it learns an entirely new way
518000	520000	literally it played against itself
520000	522000	it dreamt
522000	524000	so then it plays against itself in its memory
524000	526000	and then it does that again and again and again
526000	528000	and so within just a few weeks
528000	530000	it outperformed him
530000	532000	and then these models got better and better
532000	534000	and smaller and smaller, we haven't seen the generalization of the models yet
534000	536000	but they're coming
536000	538000	so you have to optimize when you don't even tell it the rules
538000	540000	which is kind of insane
540000	542000	then on the other hand
542000	544000	you had what was known as foundation models
544000	546000	which is where this attention based
546000	548000	architecture came in
548000	550000	so in the attention thing they were seeing when the games were
550000	552000	actually a final thing about this
552000	554000	and you can see this in the AlphaGo documentary
554000	556000	that's on YouTube if you want to see more details
556000	558000	is that as a result of this
558000	560000	did Lisa doll go and say
560000	562000	I'm hanging up my go pieces
562000	564000	and I'm going to pack them away, no
564000	566000	he started playing against it and now he's even better
566000	568000	as a player
568000	570000	and the entire go
570000	572000	competitive scene has improved
572000	574000	because now they're figuring out brand new ways
574000	576000	and gambits and things they'd never seen before
576000	578000	which I think is really interesting
578000	580000	then you had this other big area
580000	582000	which was kind of some of this deep learning area
582000	584000	we have these big corpuses
584000	586000	and like I said you can do extrapolations
586000	588000	but you don't understand meaning
588000	590000	and so this is where these attention based architectures came in
590000	592000	it's actually quite interesting
592000	594000	when I was taking a break
594000	596000	from fund management to work with my son
596000	598000	autism is a very interesting condition
598000	600000	no cure, nothing to be done
600000	602000	so of course you know you go and quit being a hedge fund manager
602000	604000	and build a team and try to do it
604000	606000	because you go maniacs right
606000	608000	my wife is a applied behavioural
608000	610000	analyst who just treats kids
610000	612000	with autism
612000	614000	so I lived that life
614000	616000	exactly so applied behavioural
616000	618000	analysis uses variable
618000	620000	rewards and a lot of the stuff you use in video games
620000	622000	to rebuild words
622000	624000	so if you have a stroke or you have autism
624000	626000	you haven't basically said can
626000	628000	right so the word can can mean I can
628000	630000	it can mean that can
630000	632000	it can mean the can can
632000	634000	lots of different things
634000	636000	but because there's so much noise in the brain
636000	638000	which is why you see a lot of kids and adults with autism
638000	640000	not being able to handle large amounts of information
640000	642000	I don't have aspergers myself and ADHD
642000	644000	they usually balance out
644000	646000	sometimes not quite
646000	648000	it's very difficult to pay attention
648000	650000	to how you feel that
650000	652000	like you know when your leg is tapping
652000	654000	there's just too much going on
654000	656000	that's the fugue state
656000	658000	because there's two transmitters in the brain
658000	660000	GABA which calms you down
660000	662000	and GLUTAMATE which excites you
662000	664000	so when you pop a valiant the GABA levels go up
664000	666000	and imagine if your brain was always excited
666000	668000	for one reason or another
668000	670000	you wouldn't be able to concentrate
670000	672000	and build those connections to the word can
672000	674000	you know that hidden layer of meaning
674000	676000	for what can is
676000	678000	what can actually cause it
678000	680000	but because medicine treats everyone the same
680000	682000	it meant that one drug that made 34% of kids better
682000	684000	made 28% of kids worse
684000	686000	so there's no cure and there's no treatment
686000	688000	so that's a different bigger story
688000	690000	and something again this AI can help with
690000	692000	and why is that relevant
692000	694000	it's because what this AI does now
694000	696000	is exactly the same
696000	698000	it uses giant honking supercomputers
698000	700000	so that if you take a terabyte of text
700000	702000	it learns what the most important words
702000	704000	in the sentence are
704000	706000	it took
706000	708000	a thousand gigabytes of text
708000	710000	and it learned how to write in any style
710000	712000	and any extension
712000	714000	so it paid the most important part of any sentence
714000	716000	so you give it a sentence like legolas and gimli
716000	718000	that's all you give it and it'll write an entire scene
718000	720000	in the style of Tolkien
720000	722000	that's never been seen before
722000	724000	you know you give it a sentence
724000	726000	and you say make it happier
726000	728000	it understands what happier is
728000	730000	and this is what's called a latent space of meaning
730000	732000	because it takes
732000	734000	that took one terabyte
734000	736000	of information so a thousand gigabytes
736000	738000	and GPT-3 is about
738000	740000	40 gigabytes in size
740000	742000	but it can recreate any style of writing
742000	744000	an understanding style of writing
744000	746000	which is again a bit crazy
746000	748000	I mean it's
748000	750000	it's staggering and we'll come into the societal impact
750000	752000	on what this all means in a bit
752000	754000	but just want to get through the technology
754000	756000	it is astonishing when you see GPT-3
756000	758000	because basically it writes authentic
758000	760000	pieces
760000	762000	that are not stolen from other things
762000	764000	much like
764000	766000	the deep
766000	768000	deep mind did with go
768000	770000	it wasn't stealing from old games
770000	772000	it learnt how to do it
772000	774000	is that right?
774000	776000	it learnt principles, it learnt stars
776000	778000	it learnt what's called a latent space
778000	780000	the hidden layers of meanings
780000	782000	between different types of words
782000	784000	so like we just released
784000	786000	the most advanced image version of that
786000	788000	stable diffusion
788000	790000	stable diffusion took
790000	792000	100,000 gigabytes
792000	794000	so 100 terabytes of images
794000	796000	and we made a 2 gigabyte file
796000	798000	that can do any style
798000	800000	and any image of any type
800000	802000	so this is like Dali
802000	804000	right?
804000	806000	it's Dali on steroids
818000	820000	so subscribe now to the channel
820000	822000	and never miss an update
822000	824000	there is simply too much going on
824000	826000	so subscribe now, thank you
826000	828000	so
828000	830000	explain Dali and then we'll come into what you're doing
830000	832000	because again
832000	834000	I just want to get people up the knowledge graph
834000	836000	because Dali was the next big one that I stopped
836000	838000	in my tracks and went holy shit this is
838000	840000	amazing
840000	842000	so GPT-3 came out in 2020
842000	844000	and then we released
844000	846000	the open source version of that GPT-Mia
846000	848000	which I'll convert to
848000	850000	last year there was a breakthrough in image generation
850000	852000	so you can generate text and everyone was like
852000	854000	image is too difficult right?
854000	856000	because a picture paints a thousand words
856000	858000	like it's really going to be a thousand kinds of complex
858000	860000	turns out it wasn't
860000	862000	so you had something called clip
862000	864000	which basically you took any image
864000	866000	and it would be able to classify it
866000	868000	so it would be able to say that's a Raoul
868000	870000	and that's a red sofa and all these things
870000	872000	understand loads of concepts because they compress that down
872000	874000	then you had a generative model that took words to images
874000	876000	so you had two models, a word to image model
876000	878000	and image to word model
878000	880000	and at the start of last year we figured out how to bounce them off each other
880000	882000	so it would generate an image
882000	884000	and it would check if that image was the same as the prompt
884000	886000	and it would go back and forth, back and forth
886000	888000	and after 10 minutes you'd generate
888000	890000	a semulchrum of an image
890000	892000	from the word input so words go in and images come out
892000	894000	and you're like oh crap
894000	896000	it looks a bit mushy
896000	898000	but that's insane, it can generate an image of anything
898000	900000	but it isn't high quality
900000	902000	then what happened is that
902000	904000	OpenAI and us accelerated that whole space
904000	906000	because we thought it was freaking cool
906000	908000	and put lots of research into it
908000	910000	and so you've got to the point now whereby
910000	912000	you can put in Robert De Niro's Gandalf
912000	914000	and one second later
914000	916000	you get an image output
916000	918000	so the first output of that was
918000	920000	that hit the mainstream was Dali from OpenAI
920000	922000	that was in April of this year
922000	924000	so you can say
924000	926000	a cybercone, goth girl
926000	928000	overlooking Neo Tokyo
928000	930000	and boom, 8 seconds later it's generated
930000	932000	and this is a totally unique
932000	934000	creative image that did not exist
934000	936000	in the world before, right?
936000	938000	it did not exist in the world before
938000	940000	all the data that went into that
940000	942000	so it was about 600 million images
942000	944000	it can't recreate any of those images
944000	946000	instead it's learned the
946000	948000	principles of that so again it's
948000	950000	the principle based analysis
950000	952000	which is insane, right?
952000	954000	because it's like
954000	956000	again it's the heuristic stuff that we do all the time
956000	958000	and they combine different concepts
958000	960000	you can say a Van Gogh
960000	962000	by Banksy
962000	964000	and it will do a Van Gogh
964000	966000	by Banksy or you can kind of do a screen
966000	968000	and now there's more and more technologies
968000	970000	that have been measured from that
970000	972000	so OpenAI kind of announced the closed beta
972000	974000	of that and then
974000	976000	my company Stability AI
976000	978000	created a version, well it's 30 times faster
978000	980000	and more powerful
980000	982000	so tell me about Stability AI
982000	984000	when did it start, who's involved
984000	986000	what are you guys doing?
986000	988000	yeah, so starting in 2020
988000	990000	we're technically starting in 2019
990000	992000	with the education work
992000	994000	but I can talk about that later
994000	996000	but 2020 is when it was formed officially
996000	998000	to do the COVID work
998000	1000000	so it's lead the UN COVID initiative
1000000	1002000	launched at Stanford etc
1002000	1004000	I founded it, yeah
1004000	1006000	because
1006000	1008000	someone needs to build something
1008000	1010000	to do AI as a public good
1010000	1012000	so I didn't exactly know what the business model was
1012000	1014000	or anything like that then, I just thought
1014000	1016000	people are dying effectively
1016000	1018000	and then we have the other products, actually I'll mention it
1018000	1020000	so my co-founder and I
1020000	1022000	so Joe's runs the charitable arm
1022000	1024000	we have took the global X prize
1024000	1026000	for learning so that was a $15 million
1026000	1028000	prize funded by Elon Musk and Tony Robbins
1028000	1030000	for the first app that could teach
1030000	1032000	literacy and numeracy in 18 months
1032000	1034000	for that internet and we've been deploying
1034000	1036000	in refugee camps and low income areas around the world
1036000	1038000	to the point where now
1038000	1040000	we are teaching kids literacy
1040000	1042000	and numeracy in 13 months and one hour a day
1042000	1044000	in a refugee camp in Malawi
1044000	1046000	and we just got the remit
1046000	1048000	to educate every child in Malawi, 3.9 million kids
1048000	1050000	with a completely open
1050000	1052000	book of hardware, software, deployment and curriculum
1052000	1054000	so we're going to invite the world to say
1054000	1056000	let's build an open source education system
1056000	1058000	where the AI teaches the kids and the kids teach the AI
1058000	1060000	that's the type of stuff that we wanted to do
1060000	1062000	because so much of the world's issues
1062000	1064000	are coordination problems
1064000	1066000	so I figured out how to bring in the multilaterals
1066000	1068000	the locals and others like the simple mechanism design
1068000	1070000	and so let's do education
1070000	1072000	let's do healthcare but then as we were doing this
1072000	1074000	and we talked to a lot of the big private companies
1074000	1076000	they promised a lot and they didn't deliver
1076000	1078000	and it's called me thinking about the future
1078000	1080000	so some of the people on this call
1080000	1082000	will be familiar with
1082000	1084000	the Chinese social credit score system
1084000	1086000	and the use of AI in China
1086000	1088000	to identify Ugears and others
1088000	1090000	and everyone's got a rating
1090000	1092000	you hang out with someone with too low a rating
1092000	1094000	your rating starts to go down
1094000	1096000	8 million people in China can't use planes or trains
1096000	1098000	it's behavioural economics right
1098000	1100000	done by AI
1100000	1102000	it's gamified life
1102000	1104000	life has become a video game
1104000	1106000	and AI is the extra system on top
1106000	1108000	but now you think about it
1108000	1110000	the entire web 2
1110000	1112000	was basically Facebook and Google
1112000	1114000	it was AI
1114000	1116000	big data models
1116000	1118000	and now you've moved to the big model era
1118000	1120000	where to build these models you need to have the best data
1120000	1122000	amazingly smart people
1122000	1124000	and fricking supercomputers
1124000	1126000	why fricking supercomputers I mean
1126000	1128000	is that a multiple times faster than NASA
1128000	1130000	supercomputers because that's what compresses
1130000	1132000	this data down into knowledge
1132000	1134000	so information to knowledge on this
1134000	1136000	because knowledge is when you extract the principles
1136000	1138000	from information right
1138000	1140000	and then wisdom is when you apply it to today
1140000	1142000	so we have this some knowledge extraction system
1142000	1144000	so I looked at that and I was like
1144000	1146000	the only people that can build this are NVIDIA
1146000	1148000	Meta, Google
1148000	1150000	slash DeepMind, Microsoft
1150000	1152000	slash OpenAI
1152000	1154000	and how are they aligned
1154000	1156000	because this is super powerful technology
1156000	1158000	they can be used to target us ads better than anything else
1158000	1160000	or it can be used to change our mind because it's convincing
1160000	1162000	you see GPT-3 writing
1162000	1164000	you can't tell it's not a human
1164000	1166000	right
1166000	1168000	you look at the audio version you can't listen
1168000	1170000	say it's not human like my sister-in-law
1170000	1172000	Zeena just sold her company
1172000	1174000	to Spotify, it's an Antik
1174000	1176000	fully emotionally real AI voices
1176000	1178000	using this technology
1178000	1180000	so she did the technology for all the
1180000	1182000	Blizzard and everything
1182000	1184000	and then somebody has now got AI
1184000	1186000	for creating podcasts
1186000	1188000	so you can have Joe Rogan interviewing
1188000	1190000	Steve Jobs
1190000	1192000	neither of these exist and the interview never existed
1192000	1194000	but the AI does it
1194000	1196000	and it sounds just like them right
1196000	1198000	and this is the thing it's got that human level
1198000	1200000	so like Sanantik also did
1200000	1202000	Bal Kilmer's voice for his documentary
1202000	1204000	in Top Gun because he lost it completely
1204000	1206000	and it's completely emotionally real
1206000	1208000	so it's getting to that period of emotional realness
1208000	1210000	and human realness
1210000	1212000	which means then you think about the future and you're like
1212000	1214000	this is one of the most powerful technologies
1214000	1216000	ever because it's approaching humanity
1216000	1218000	not in a generalized sense
1218000	1220000	where the AI can do everything in its sky net
1220000	1222000	but as a tool
1222000	1224000	for targeting and convincing
1224000	1226000	and manipulation
1226000	1228000	so what happens if only big tech companies
1228000	1230000	do this because they went from being open
1230000	1232000	to being private even open AI
1232000	1234000	that got a billion dollars from Musk
1234000	1236000	and others and then a billion from Microsoft
1236000	1238000	stop releasing their code
1238000	1240000	so people can have this
1240000	1242000	so they turn closed
1242000	1244000	and then they stop sharing
1244000	1246000	and you're like as this is the most powerful thing
1246000	1248000	if you fast forward 5-10 years
1248000	1250000	does it make sense that a private company will have a monopoly
1250000	1252000	or a series of private companies will have a monopoly on this
1252000	1254000	then it will reflect
1254000	1256000	basically Palo Alto norms
1256000	1258000	and it will mean those companies are more powerful
1258000	1260000	than any government in the earth
1260000	1262000	and I was like that's wrong
1262000	1264000	I was like there needs to be
1264000	1266000	an alternative that is open
1266000	1268000	you know kind of AI for the people by the people we call it
1268000	1270000	because
1270000	1272000	not only is that morally right
1272000	1274000	because it's unethical to keep powerful technology
1274000	1276000	that can make people's lives better
1276000	1278000	from the people that can benefit from it the most
1278000	1280000	but it's actually a better model
1280000	1282000	because you have open innovation
1282000	1284000	this is why Linux became the servers of choice
1284000	1286000	and the most secure servers
1286000	1288000	Windows has all these holes in
1288000	1290000	Linux holes get patched instantly right
1290000	1292000	this is where you've got databases kind of taking over
1292000	1294000	because nothing can beat human creativity when that happened
1294000	1296000	I look at web3 and crypto
1296000	1298000	and I'm like it nearly got there
1298000	1300000	and then it kind of got hijacked
1300000	1302000	because it was part of the puzzle
1302000	1304000	but it wasn't the whole puzzle
1304000	1306000	because when I went to talk to a lot of web3 people
1306000	1308000	I'm like where's the AI in web3
1308000	1310000	they were like well we'll get to it
1310000	1312000	but I was like the whole of web2 was AI
1312000	1314000	how are you gonna do web3 without AI
1314000	1316000	and when they gave examples like Alephia
1316000	1318000	and other things
1318000	1320000	with the talking NFTs
1320000	1322000	the technology they used was our technology
1322000	1324000	and we released
1324000	1326000	but usgpt near
1326000	1328000	which I thought was quite interesting
1328000	1330000	so then I realised it's actually a bigger thing here
1330000	1332000	and a bigger reason to do this
1332000	1334000	but how do you compete with open AI
1334000	1336000	and deep mines and Microsoft and Google
1336000	1338000	with their billions of dollars of budget
1340000	1342000	which was an interesting one
1342000	1344000	how do you do it right
1344000	1346000	do you go and raise two billion dollars
1346000	1348000	no go do it another way
1348000	1350000	so what did you do
1350000	1352000	so I built community
1352000	1354000	so in 2020 a lot of people
1354000	1356000	were just like you know COVID
1356000	1358000	and in quarantine
1358000	1360000	so we built up a Luther AI
1360000	1362000	which the base principle was
1362000	1364000	let's create an open source version of GPT3
1364000	1366000	you know
1366000	1368000	did you create it
1368000	1370000	or clone GPT3
1370000	1372000	and then allowed to build on top
1372000	1374000	how do you start this
1374000	1376000	so like there were five initial creators
1376000	1378000	and then I came like a month after
1378000	1380000	and we were working with some of the second wave
1380000	1382000	and said let's accelerate this up
1382000	1384000	so they looked at the model so the data wasn't open
1384000	1386000	so we had to create our own data set
1386000	1388000	and so we had to crawl the internet
1388000	1390000	and create a terabyte of data
1390000	1392000	the compute wasn't available
1392000	1394000	so we got a grant from Google
1394000	1396000	who provided the compute initially
1396000	1398000	and then the expertise
1398000	1400000	it was all like PhD students
1400000	1402000	or self-taught programmers
1402000	1404000	and others were like how would this work
1404000	1406000	because they released an academic paper
1406000	1408000	from scratch and then created a model
1408000	1410000	that was 75% as good
1410000	1412000	but it was available
1412000	1414000	so the models from a Luther AI
1414000	1416000	which kind of stability runs now
1416000	1418000	basically via the top level
1418000	1420000	people but we're going to spin it off
1420000	1422000	into its own independent charity
1422000	1424000	for a number of reasons
1424000	1426000	they've been downloaded 25 million times
1426000	1428000	now by developers
1428000	1430000	so anytime you see a chat bot
1430000	1432000	or something like that that's getting to human levels
1432000	1434000	it's probably going to be that
1434000	1436000	it's 80% as good as GPT-3
1436000	1438000	but it doesn't matter because you can customize it
1438000	1440000	and you can extend it
1440000	1442000	and you can run it on your own hardware
1442000	1444000	so it's a 20 billion parameter model
1444000	1446000	versus 175 billion parameter model
1446000	1448000	it's eight times smaller
1448000	1450000	but you know it's just like the big steel mills
1450000	1452000	and the little ones if you look at the kind of Clayton Christian
1452000	1454000	small can outcompete big
1454000	1456000	and then I realized that there's a talent arbitrage here
1456000	1458000	whereby there's a lot of people
1458000	1460000	that want to build open source
1460000	1462000	but there's no super compute
1462000	1464000	in academia so when I said super compute
1464000	1466000	needed for this I meant it
1466000	1468000	like the
1468000	1470000	amount of super compute
1470000	1472000	the amount of breakthroughs in this foundational
1472000	1474000	model research
1474000	1476000	20 years ago 100% came from academia
1476000	1478000	10 years ago 75%
1478000	1480000	came from academia last year
1480000	1482000	0% came from academia
1482000	1484000	because there was this
1484000	1486000	massive ramp-up in compute capabilities
1486000	1488000	but academia couldn't access it
1488000	1490000	only private companies could
1490000	1492000	so if you wanted to have a breakthrough
1492000	1494000	or work in cutting edge research you had three options
1494000	1496000	do a start up, start up suck
1496000	1498000	put that to the side, especially for academics
1498000	1500000	number two you go and work for big tech
1500000	1502000	and then you get 59 page NDAs
1502000	1504000	and you might do cool stuff
1504000	1506000	like we've seen text to video from the Google team
1506000	1508000	that'll never be released by Google
1508000	1510000	because of ethical fears which we can discuss
1510000	1512000	and the final option is
1512000	1514000	you go and work for some of these independent labs
1514000	1516000	like OpenAI and others that were meant to be independent
1516000	1518000	and then became less independent over time
1518000	1520000	otherwise you stay in academia and you're like
1520000	1522000	I would like to do these but I can't
1522000	1524000	so I saw that the core
1524000	1526000	choke point was compute
1526000	1528000	a community was forming for talent
1528000	1530000	and then we need to be highly structured about data
1530000	1532000	so what I did was
1532000	1534000	I said how big a super computer can I build
1534000	1536000	if I put all my money into it
1536000	1538000	and I'd become very persuasive
1538000	1540000	and then I built the 10th fastest public
1540000	1542000	super computer in the world in four months
1544000	1546000	and it turns out you can build a very large super computer
1546000	1548000	so Ezra 1 which is our super computer
1548000	1550000	which all my money went into
1550000	1552000	is about
1552000	1554000	eight times faster than the fastest
1554000	1556000	super computer in the UK
1556000	1558000	and about seven times faster than all of NASA's
1558000	1560000	super computers put together
1560000	1562000	and that's the level that you need
1562000	1564000	to basically create these models
1564000	1566000	it's like the entry level
1566000	1568000	that need for compute keeps going up
1568000	1570000	can you use distributed computing power
1570000	1572000	or is it still not fast enough
1572000	1574000	so
1574000	1576000	you can do it once you've done the initial model
1576000	1578000	so what happens is that you take
1578000	1580000	in this case we took 100,000 gigabytes of data
1580000	1582000	so we made the biggest image data set in the world
1582000	1584000	previously the largest was 100 million
1584000	1586000	then we made 400 million
1586000	1588000	then we made 5.6 billion
1588000	1590000	a 250 terabyte image
1590000	1592000	label pair data set
1592000	1594000	then we took 2 billion of that
1594000	1596000	which is the high quality images and then we crunched them back and forth on this
1596000	1598000	so what happens is after you crunched
1598000	1600000	them back and forth then you've got a file
1600000	1602000	that can be adapted and trained
1602000	1604000	basically it's gone through
1604000	1606000	primary school
1606000	1608000	of learning
1608000	1610000	and then you can teach it more advanced concepts
1610000	1612000	so like some people are taking the training on Japanese
1612000	1614000	concepts, some people are taking
1614000	1616000	anime cat girl, waifus or whatever
1616000	1618000	you can add that specialization
1618000	1620000	once it's achieved kind of the high school level
1620000	1622000	so there's a big compute
1622000	1624000	and a little computer
1624000	1626000	does the network then learn from all of these people
1626000	1628000	working on the network itself
1628000	1630000	no
1630000	1632000	it's distributed and you've got lots of people doing different things
1632000	1634000	does that increase the knowledge base
1634000	1636000	or not
1636000	1638000	it increases the large base of the community
1638000	1640000	but we have to understand this model
1640000	1642000	it's not a distributed model where it's like lots of little
1642000	1644000	brain cells out there
1644000	1646000	it's a 2
1646000	1648000	gigabyte file
1648000	1650000	that can recreate
1650000	1652000	and create any image in any style
1652000	1654000	so you took 100,000 gigabytes of image and created
1654000	1656000	so sometimes I think
1656000	1658000	I'm on that Silicon Valley show
1658000	1660000	and we're from HBO
1660000	1662000	and we're Pied Piper and I think
1662000	1664000	crap, am I Erlich Backman or Ross Hanneman
1664000	1666000	you know
1666000	1668000	it's one of those kind of guys right
1668000	1670000	it's the most advanced technology
1670000	1672000	the world's ever seen for compression because
1672000	1674000	the entirety of humanity is basically
1674000	1676000	about communication and compression
1676000	1678000	we're compression machines
1678000	1680000	that's all we do
1680000	1682000	so people are listening to this podcast now
1682000	1684000	and they're listening to yours and mine
1684000	1686000	common context and the compression
1686000	1688000	and the knowledge that we've had over the years
1688000	1690000	and they're learning something new right now
1690000	1692000	it's what we do and hopefully it's valuable
1692000	1694000	because they'll see that holy crap this new technology way
1694000	1696000	was coming but if you can do it to images
1696000	1698000	you can do it to anything so actually how we had
1698000	1700000	the breakthrough is we took a language model
1700000	1702000	and image model and we fused them together
1702000	1704000	and somehow it learned the different concepts
1704000	1706000	then what we're seeing is that
1706000	1708000	when you have different models of different types
1708000	1710000	so someone takes a 2 gigabyte file
1710000	1712000	you take it and you put it on all your images in
1712000	1714000	and I take it and I put all my images in
1714000	1716000	and I fused them together and create another 2 gigabyte file
1716000	1718000	that knows both of them without going up
1718000	1720000	in size very much
1720000	1722000	that's a bit insane in fact
1722000	1724000	OpenAI did this with a model called GATO
1724000	1726000	recently
1726000	1728000	so what happened is that there were
1728000	1730000	hundreds of different models they built that were quite big
1730000	1732000	that were like robotics
1732000	1734000	and playing chess and all these other things
1736000	1738000	they said what happens if we combine them all together
1738000	1740000	and see what happens to these latent spaces
1740000	1742000	the hidden meanings of understanding just like the neurons in our brain
1742000	1744000	it created a 1.6 billion
1744000	1746000	parameter file that can
1746000	1748000	open doors and play chess
1748000	1750000	and play starcraft and all sorts of other things
1752000	1754000	and they were like what
1754000	1756000	and this is the thing
1756000	1758000	you've got a breakthrough in intelligence
1758000	1760000	but then you've broken through
1760000	1762000	to the point where this is the important part
1762000	1764000	stable diffusion is the first model
1764000	1766000	that's small enough, fast enough and cheap enough
1766000	1768000	to go anywhere
1768000	1770000	so you can run it on your MacBook M1
1770000	1772000	and you can make Robert De Niro by Banksy
1772000	1774000	and Renoir
1774000	1776000	in Guadalajara
1776000	1778000	in a snowstorm
1778000	1780000	without internet access
1780000	1782000	and that 2GB file will reproduce that
1782000	1784000	faithfully each time
1786000	1788000	yes
1788000	1790000	it is a 2GB file that has
1790000	1792000	compressed the knowledge of the internet
1792000	1794000	in images
1794000	1796000	I can't quite get my head around this
1796000	1798000	so
1798000	1800000	where do you think
1800000	1802000	what you're working on goes
1802000	1804000	what is the image thing, where is this going towards
1804000	1806000	because right now it's kind of interesting
1806000	1808000	yes we're going to see
1808000	1810000	creative industries, marketing, others use this
1810000	1812000	quite quickly and effectively
1812000	1814000	but where is this
1814000	1816000	in your head, where is your mental model
1816000	1818000	what you're actually working on here
1818000	1820000	because you're not working on
1820000	1822000	creating nice images, you're working on something bigger
1822000	1824000	what is that
1824000	1826000	it's the intelligent internet
1826000	1828000	this is about to be pushed out to the edge
1828000	1830000	so every person, country, country and culture
1830000	1832000	has their own models that are constantly updated
1832000	1834000	so you'll have your own model
1834000	1836000	of all your knowledge across modalities
1836000	1838000	and you can run it on your local hardware
1838000	1840000	without being accessed to the internet
1840000	1842000	so the internet right now is centralized
1842000	1844000	and all that is running on Google servers
1844000	1846000	and guiding you, that gets pushed out to the edge
1846000	1848000	because finally
1848000	1850000	you have this compression technology
1850000	1852000	and you know, it's interesting because there's a bunch of structural things here
1852000	1854000	so Apple is the most interesting thing
1854000	1856000	with regards to this
1856000	1858000	Apple will be the biggest AI company in the world in two years
1858000	1860000	why?
1860000	1862000	I'm listening to this on a MacBook
1862000	1864000	M1 right now
1864000	1866000	16.8% of the chipset
1866000	1868000	is a neural engine that's not used
1868000	1870000	that is designed for exactly this type of model
1870000	1872000	and it's proliferating right
1872000	1874000	everyone's moving to M1 MacBooks
1874000	1876000	everyone's moving to A16 Bionics
1876000	1878000	that also have neural engines
1878000	1880000	and they're not used, are Apple stupid? No
1880000	1882000	they have an entire teams building these types of models
1882000	1884000	for their augmented reality and beyond
1884000	1886000	so you're going to move from Siri 1 to Siri 5
1886000	1888000	the Siri is a bit crap
1888000	1890000	it won't be seen
1890000	1892000	and so as that technology proliferates
1892000	1894000	and then people take what
1894000	1896000	we're building
1896000	1898000	and you create 100,000 million
1898000	1900000	new developers in this space
1900000	1902000	the possibilities are endless
1902000	1904000	you've seen hundreds of things built on stable diffusion
1904000	1906000	but like I said, I don't just want images
1906000	1908000	I want audio, I want video, I want to have text
1908000	1910000	I want knowledge, I want my databases
1910000	1912000	combined with my type 1 and type 2 brains
1912000	1914000	and then you have an AI
1914000	1916000	that either manipulates you
1916000	1918000	or it works for you
1918000	1920000	and my thing is it's open infrastructure
1920000	1922000	that should work for every individual
1922000	1924000	and this is also why I've got a very different approach to most
1924000	1926000	so most people's approach would be B2B
1926000	1928000	go to the big companies and sell them API access
1928000	1930000	instead I'm forward deploying
1930000	1932000	engineers into the biggest brands in the world
1932000	1934000	getting them to invest in my next round
1934000	1936000	of financing
1936000	1938000	and I'm also doing that for countries
1938000	1940000	like India and saying what's the probability this technology
1940000	1942000	will be used by everyone in India in 10 to 20 years
1942000	1944000	100%
1944000	1946000	or 95%
1946000	1948000	so I'm saying I will build it for you next year
1948000	1950000	and getting all the biggest Indian conglomerates
1950000	1952000	and others together
1952000	1954000	and taking the smartest engineers out of Silicon Valley
1954000	1956000	back to India
1956000	1958000	like one of my fun ones is I have a JV with Eros
1958000	1960000	which is the Netflix of India
1960000	1962000	so 200 million daily active users
1962000	1964000	all the Bollywood content, I have an exclusive on it
1964000	1966000	and a revenue share
1966000	1968000	so what's the probability that
1968000	1970000	Bollywood content will be interactive
1970000	1972000	through these models
1972000	1974000	of course it will be
1974000	1976000	so I'm locking down all the content
1976000	1978000	Netflix really works on interactive content actually
1978000	1980000	yeah but not like this
1980000	1982000	they don't have this expertise because right now
1982000	1984000	you know how many people can build these models
1984000	1986000	40
1986000	1988000	in 5 years how many people will be able to
1988000	1990000	build these models
1990000	1992000	4 million
1992000	1994000	so there's some really interesting arbitrages
1994000	1996000	in the market right now
1996000	1998000	and my take is that if I push hard enough
1998000	2000000	and I outcompete the big guys which I am
2000000	2002000	like my team is 100 now
2002000	2004000	you know
2004000	2006000	and I'm outcompeting these big guys by building
2006000	2008000	products
2008000	2010000	products to the market quicker
2010000	2012000	then I force everyone to go open source
2012000	2014000	because it's no longer a differentiating factor
2014000	2016000	and then that changes it
2016000	2018000	from a closed panopticon for our kids
2018000	2020000	you know and ourselves
2020000	2022000	to something different
2022000	2024000	but I think it's more beneficial
2024000	2026000	okay so let's talk about what it could be
2026000	2028000	it's
2028000	2030000	clearly fucking terrifying
2030000	2032000	because
2032000	2034000	either open source or in private hands
2034000	2036000	if it's open source
2036000	2038000	it's like a
2038000	2040000	virus
2040000	2042000	it'll go where it goes
2042000	2044000	and people will use it how they use it
2044000	2046000	and there's no stopping it
2046000	2048000	okay fine
2048000	2050000	how does society deal
2050000	2052000	with the fact that we don't know
2052000	2054000	who is a human and who is not
2054000	2056000	and how we're being manipulated
2056000	2058000	and who not I wrote a thread on this the other day
2058000	2060000	about digital ID being
2060000	2062000	one of these key things
2062000	2064000	but it's this whole element of deep fake
2064000	2066000	of what is real in this world
2066000	2068000	how do you deal with this
2068000	2070000	because it's going to shatter society
2072000	2074000	it will adjust society definitely
2074000	2076000	and so
2076000	2078000	kind of a reason for releasing the model
2078000	2080000	you know during the COVID thing
2080000	2082000	I just had a lot of conversations about third immunity
2082000	2084000	right
2084000	2086000	which was bad for that
2086000	2088000	I believe it's good for this
2088000	2090000	releasing this model out there it's going to be everywhere in a year
2090000	2092000	this is a one to one
2092000	2094000	billion person moment right
2094000	2096000	we're right now a few million people
2096000	2098000	this is exponential without question
2098000	2100000	it's exponential without question
2100000	2102000	but this is a really interesting thing
2102000	2104000	right now very few people know that you can create anything
2104000	2106000	in a second
2106000	2108000	for one cent and less than a cent soon
2108000	2110000	right soon everyone will know about it
2110000	2112000	because it will be in all your favourite apps
2112000	2114000	so we're integrated into Canva right now
2114000	2116000	we're integrated into Photoshop
2116000	2118000	you can see big announcements coming out
2118000	2120000	because we're partnering with everyone
2120000	2122000	with interactive content
2122000	2124000	what does that mean it means people suddenly start thinking about this thing
2124000	2126000	what is real what is not real
2126000	2128000	and I said identity is key
2128000	2130000	so the other part of Apple
2130000	2132000	the fact that they got the identity architecture down
2132000	2134000	and that allows them to have verified content creation
2134000	2136000	what we have with Adobe and others
2136000	2138000	is we've been pushing content
2138000	2140000	authority basically
2140000	2142000	which is a small metadata pile
2142000	2144000	that attaches to every piece of content
2144000	2146000	and it's hash and if either of them are edited
2146000	2148000	it changes and it shows that it's not true
2148000	2150000	it's not a blockchain thing
2150000	2152000	but it allows you to verify
2152000	2154000	content
2154000	2156000	in a positive way
2156000	2158000	why is it not on blockchain
2158000	2160000	it's not on blockchain because it doesn't need to be on blockchain
2160000	2162000	that's why
2162000	2164000	there's a generalization of the knowledge
2164000	2166000	because like Google owns all of the knowledge
2166000	2168000	blockchain is the only way
2168000	2170000	of not having one central power
2170000	2172000	owning the knowledge
2172000	2174000	it is a way
2174000	2176000	of not having one central power owning the knowledge
2176000	2178000	and you combine this with a blockchain
2178000	2180000	but you can think of it as super advanced metadata
2180000	2182000	so you know when you have metadata
2182000	2184000	in a file like Exif
2184000	2186000	when you edit that the file stays constant
2186000	2188000	with this they're both immutable
2188000	2190000	effectively so you can tell
2190000	2192000	that the other has been tampered
2192000	2194000	so if it says that it's from Raoul
2194000	2196000	it's from Raoul effectively
2196000	2198000	but there's no blockchain look up for that
2198000	2200000	you can make it stronger with a blockchain
2200000	2202000	but you know it's just a standard that's open source
2202000	2204000	that we're pushing effectively
2204000	2206000	so it's kind of a positive one
2206000	2208000	it's not a negative one
2208000	2210000	obviously there's ways around that and things like that
2210000	2212000	but it'll get people thinking about these things
2212000	2214000	how does identity work in a new age
2214000	2216000	because so much of what we do is identity
2216000	2218000	most of finance is basically
2218000	2220000	most of kind of
2220000	2222000	the whole blockchain is identity
2222000	2224000	it's all about identity exchange
2224000	2226000	so this thing is how can we build better systems for identity
2226000	2228000	because that's the final part
2228000	2230000	information, there's massive information
2230000	2232000	and also stable diffusion
2232000	2234000	as we released it was a snapshot of the internet
2234000	2236000	it's biased, it's racist, it's everything
2236000	2238000	if you enter the prompts and wrong
2238000	2240000	part of that is
2240000	2242000	showing some of the images of the racial bias
2242000	2244000	of the algorithms
2244000	2246000	so my thing was like
2246000	2248000	if it's just one company that controls it
2248000	2250000	what opening I did with Dali
2250000	2252000	so Dali is a control system, you don't access the code
2252000	2254000	images or anything
2254000	2256000	to make it less racist
2256000	2258000	whenever a gender neutral word
2258000	2260000	is put like sumo wrestler
2260000	2262000	it would randomly add
2262000	2264000	a gender and a race
2264000	2266000	so you type in sumo wrestler
2266000	2268000	and you've got Indian female sumo wrestler
2268000	2270000	tiny little Indian lady
2270000	2272000	sumo wrestling
2272000	2274000	and stuff like that
2274000	2276000	that is one way
2276000	2278000	but instead my preference is for every single company
2278000	2280000	country and culture to have their own models
2280000	2282000	and be able to create their own
2282000	2284000	and then like I said it becomes acknowledged what it looks like
2284000	2286000	but then you can set standards
2286000	2288000	you can be the standard that people build around
2288000	2290000	and you can incorporate authentication in that standard
2290000	2292000	because the other way that I talk about these things
2292000	2294000	is a generative search engine
2294000	2296000	because now you have stable diffusion
2296000	2298000	and in six months
2298000	2300000	it will be perfect photo realistic
2300000	2302000	12 months maximum
2302000	2304000	do you need google image search anymore
2304000	2306000	because what's your job to be done
2306000	2308000	when you do google image search
2308000	2310000	is to have a picture of a certain type
2310000	2312000	now a little fricking two gigabyte file
2312000	2314000	on your local computer
2314000	2316000	or something that you pay a fraction of a penny for online
2316000	2318000	can create any image you can imagine
2318000	2320000	and you can edit it with your words basically
2320000	2322000	what is that if not
2322000	2324000	a search engine of a type
2324000	2326000	it searches for a concept
2326000	2328000	and it turns it into an image
2328000	2330000	it's a creative search engine
2330000	2332000	that creates
2332000	2334000	by as you say you just put in a word
2334000	2336000	or a vocal command and say I want this
2336000	2338000	and it creates it
2338000	2340000	but then you can also say
2340000	2342000	I want a presentation
2342000	2344000	about
2344000	2346000	cicada migrations
2346000	2348000	affecting sesame seed prices
2348000	2350000	I watched too much Silicon Valley here
2350000	2352000	and in a couple of years
2352000	2354000	it will create a beautiful presentation for you
2354000	2356000	and then you can say I want it to be happier
2356000	2358000	or sadder or I want it to be more impactful
2358000	2360000	and it will adjust the presentation dynamically for you
2360000	2362000	no more powerpoint
2362000	2364000	but it's going to do video as well right
2364000	2366000	we don't need to do this
2366000	2368000	I could just say hey have a conversation
2368000	2370000	between Raoul and Emad
2370000	2372000	about AI and here's the narrative arc
2372000	2374000	and it'll just do it
2374000	2376000	pretty much yeah just like it does in Steve Jobs
2376000	2378000	but in 3D video
2378000	2380000	so like I don't know if I should be talking about this
2380000	2382000	but I'm going to talk about it anyway
2382000	2384000	so what if I get in trouble
2384000	2386000	there are two
2386000	2388000	there are two boxing legends
2388000	2390000	families
2390000	2392000	who are giving us all of the
2392000	2394000	motion capture data
2394000	2396000	and media from their lives
2396000	2398000	and we're building up
2398000	2400000	an analysis of how that works
2400000	2402000	so that we can basically say
2402000	2404000	who won between X and Y
2404000	2406000	in a fight in their prime run on the supercomputer
2406000	2408000	where nobody knows the outcome
2408000	2410000	when they never fought with each other
2410000	2412000	because they were of different generations
2412000	2414000	yes
2414000	2416000	so you can pick two
2416000	2418000	you can pick two different people
2418000	2420000	I can't say who they are
2420000	2422000	but you know those types of things that you've always postulated
2422000	2424000	we can do that now
2424000	2426000	and obviously this is going to completely
2426000	2428000	change music as well right
2428000	2430000	yeah so we've released our music models already
2430000	2432000	uh dance diffusion
2432000	2434000	where we did a slightly different thing
2434000	2436000	we wanted to take a snapshot of the internet
2436000	2438000	we made it so everyone can take their back catalogue
2438000	2440000	incorporate it into a kindergarten level
2440000	2442000	of knowledge
2442000	2444000	for the model
2444000	2446000	and then you can query that
2446000	2448000	to create your own style in anything
2448000	2450000	so we call it dance diffusion
2450000	2452000	and we're teaming up with the top EDM
2452000	2454000	DJs and others in the world
2454000	2456000	so that every musician will have their own models
2456000	2458000	that can generate music
2458000	2460000	in their style and then
2460000	2462000	if they give permission we're going to mash them all together
2462000	2464000	and you've got a generative
2464000	2466000	Spotify
2466000	2468000	effectively which then
2468000	2470000	basically as people prompt it
2470000	2472000	there's an attribution system where it plays them
2474000	2476000	and that will just be like 100 gigabytes
2476000	2478000	as a file that will capture the music of the world
2478000	2480000	which again is insane
2480000	2482000	this compression thing
2482000	2484000	you know it's actually like you know
2484000	2486000	you read so much right Raoul
2486000	2488000	and then you write your notes
2488000	2490000	and then you write your investment thesis
2490000	2492000	investment thesis is compression of knowledge
2492000	2494000	a vaccine schedule is compression of knowledge
2494000	2496000	we finally figured out how to make computers
2496000	2498000	compress information into knowledge
2498000	2500000	so
2500000	2502000	I mean this is
2502000	2504000	I knew this was going to be an interesting conversation
2504000	2506000	and I've been
2506000	2508000	looking at this for a while
2508000	2510000	but Franklin
2510000	2512000	fucking staggered at how fast this is moving
2512000	2514000	and what you're doing
2514000	2516000	I mean this is
2516000	2518000	truly exponential as you say
2518000	2520000	within two or three years
2520000	2522000	this is multiple billion people
2522000	2524000	and the complete shift on a humanity level
2524000	2526000	of how
2526000	2528000	information is processed and delivered
2528000	2530000	and that is society
2530000	2532000	so basically it's a shift in society
2532000	2534000	and so my thing was to go
2534000	2536000	into emerging markets and others
2536000	2538000	and give us technology to them
2538000	2540000	otherwise they'll be left behind
2540000	2542000	because you know like Dali 2
2542000	2544000	you can't use if you're an Ukrainian
2544000	2546000	and you can't use it for anything Ukrainian related
2546000	2548000	and there's no appealing that
2548000	2550000	or anything like that
2550000	2552000	but it means Ukrainians are left behind
2552000	2554000	whereas everyone else can become
2554000	2556000	limited creatives that can generate
2556000	2558000	any image in eight seconds
2558000	2560000	so this is also why it's stability
2560000	2562000	we do everything, we do code models
2562000	2564000	image models, language models, audio models
2564000	2566000	video models, protein folding models and others
2566000	2568000	and so you're going to see leaps across all these areas
2568000	2570000	in parallel
2570000	2572000	I've argued for a very long time
2572000	2574000	in fact I was writing articles in GMI about this
2574000	2576000	ten years ago
2576000	2578000	that AI plus big data
2578000	2580000	equals medical breakthroughs
2580000	2582000	because
2582000	2584000	what the AI can do with that data
2584000	2586000	is something that humans can't do
2586000	2588000	in the standard scientific method
2588000	2590000	of hypothesis testing, it's just too slow
2590000	2592000	and too cumbersome
2592000	2594000	you can get it to generate null hypotheses
2594000	2596000	which humans don't like to do
2596000	2598000	you can use this to transform so many things
2598000	2600000	once it gets productized
2600000	2602000	because it's the other thing
2602000	2604000	most of this stuff was stuck in labs, it wasn't productized
2604000	2606000	so if you look at what's happened with Stable Diffusion
2606000	2608000	people have built hundreds of products on this ecosystem already
2608000	2610000	like make your own sneakers
2610000	2612000	they don't make any movie
2612000	2614000	they've done architecture, they've done 3D worlds
2614000	2616000	like the Cambrian explosion
2616000	2618000	of talent is similar to what I've seen
2618000	2620000	at the early days of Web 3
2620000	2622000	except for there's no reason
2622000	2624000	to boost traffic economic incentives
2624000	2626000	when you're creating value
2626000	2628000	a lot of value in the world, to be honest
2628000	2630000	is the entropy of information
2630000	2632000	how much value in the world is taken by taking unstructured
2632000	2634000	data and making it structured
2634000	2636000	that's exactly what this technology enables
2636000	2638000	anyone to do
2638000	2640000	and that's why we have AI that works with us
2640000	2642000	to structure the world around us
2642000	2644000	to enable us to achieve more
2644000	2646000	that's kind of my theory here
2646000	2648000	and this is again why, like I said, it needs to be
2648000	2650000	disposed of us
2650000	2652000	so you would
2652000	2654000	err towards augmented
2654000	2656000	humanity
2656000	2658000	as opposed to a singularity
2658000	2660000	or is it augmented and then a singularity
2660000	2662000	where does this go?
2662000	2664000	so look, I find the whole AGI
2664000	2666000	I think largely distasteful
2666000	2668000	there's a variety of reasons
2668000	2670000	I think it misaligns a lot of incentives
2670000	2672000	and I think the current way
2672000	2674000	a lot of these big labs are going
2674000	2676000	which is that you take the data
2676000	2678000	and you create gigantic models
2678000	2680000	that are only usable by gigantic machines
2680000	2682000	will probably kill us all
2682000	2684000	if it creates a singularity
2684000	2686000	because the incentive alignment
2686000	2688000	of these groups is to serve us ads
2688000	2690000	and manipulate us effectively
2690000	2692000	and it's trained on largely western datasets
2692000	2694000	you know what happens when you
2694000	2696000	talk to a doctor?
2696000	2698000	no, Teh, the chatbot from Microsoft
2698000	2700000	you remember that?
2700000	2702000	it became abusive
2702000	2704000	it became a Nazi
2704000	2706000	so it talked to people and learned from them
2706000	2708000	within a day and a half it turned them into a Nazi
2708000	2710000	if I train on the internet
2710000	2712000	I'm going to create a really
2712000	2714000	fucked up AI
2714000	2716000	to put it quite honestly
2716000	2718000	it's not going to be an AI that labs
2718000	2720000	it's going to be an AI that probably kills us all
2720000	2722000	whereas if everyone's got their own AIs
2722000	2724000	what does the network learn?
2724000	2726000	if we take the models of all of humanity
2726000	2728000	and all the cultures
2728000	2730000	and all the different ethical views
2730000	2732000	and we combine those models
2732000	2734000	and all these AIs are designed to augment humanity
2734000	2736000	rather than manipulate them
2736000	2738000	I think that's a far more positive potential
2738000	2740000	I don't think it's sufficient
2740000	2742000	I think a lot of work needs to be done or others
2742000	2744000	I think this AI is dangerous
2744000	2746000	but it's inevitable
2746000	2748000	and the way that it's being controlled
2748000	2750000	by private corporations
2750000	2752000	by millions of people or whatever
2752000	2754000	but I think the current mechanism is wrong
2754000	2756000	and I think again there's a lot of things
2756000	2758000	around the singularity thing
2758000	2760000	that are misaligned
2760000	2762000	if we do build singularity I would like it to help us all
2762000	2764000	but in the meantime let's just help people
2764000	2766000	let's make people more creative
2766000	2768000	let's make people able to act
2768000	2770000	but there is unintended consequences
2770000	2772000	you get that right?
2772000	2774000	there are very unintended consequences
2774000	2776000	we have no idea what the probabilistic outcome is
2776000	2778000	of this
2778000	2780000	uncertainty, not risk, right?
2780000	2782000	so this is why the default
2782000	2784000	for all of the corporations
2784000	2786000	is this technology should not be released to anyone
2786000	2788000	because we're the only ones responsible for this technology
2788000	2790000	and that in itself
2790000	2792000	and that doesn't stand up to scrutiny
2792000	2794000	there's different outcomes
2794000	2796000	from different methodology
2796000	2798000	giving it to everybody who knows
2798000	2800000	what foreign governments do
2800000	2802000	there's a lot here
2802000	2804000	I can tell you on that one
2804000	2806000	foreign governments already have access to this technology
2806000	2808000	and China and other places ramped up
2808000	2810000	their supercomputers massively
2810000	2812000	so they already have access to far more advanced versions
2812000	2814000	of this technology than the one that's being made widely available
2814000	2816000	which is one of the reasons we need to build
2816000	2818000	our immunity ahead of the next election cycle
2818000	2820000	so you think that the
2822000	2824000	let's use the Russian example
2824000	2826000	the Russian online misinformation campaign
2826000	2828000	is now being run by AI
2828000	2830000	which is why it's pretty much unstoppable
2832000	2834000	it's unstoppable if you
2834000	2836000	if you build better AI
2836000	2838000	I mean to be honest, do you like Twitter
2838000	2840000	and things like that? Like come on man
2840000	2842000	you can do better than that
2842000	2844000	like you see all the check mark hijacking and things like that
2844000	2846000	you can tell what an AI is
2846000	2848000	if you've got sufficiently advanced AI on the other side
2848000	2850000	but again, people learn to not trust everything they see
2850000	2852000	until we introduce a new structure
2852000	2854000	like we right now need to have
2854000	2856000	a verification protocol for information
2856000	2858000	our social media
2858000	2860000	and our information systems
2860000	2862000	are inadequate to the task
2862000	2864000	the internet is
2866000	2868000	it's an intelligence amplifier
2868000	2870000	but only for the few
2870000	2872000	so what happened is the internet took it, compressed it down
2872000	2874000	then some people just went way out there
2874000	2876000	and they have a disproportionate impact on everyone
2876000	2878000	and most people are left behind
2878000	2880000	they have the audiences, they set the narrative
2880000	2882000	and the narrative that
2882000	2884000	basically is most appealing to the millennium part of our brain
2884000	2886000	is one of divisiveness
2886000	2888000	which is why the middle has disappeared
2888000	2890000	and that's why it can tap into these things
2890000	2892000	that's right, exactly right
2892000	2894000	because the easiest way to manipulate humans
2894000	2896000	is emotion and the strongest emotions
2896000	2898000	are the polarizing emotions
2898000	2900000	whereas with this technology you can say
2900000	2902000	I want this article written
2902000	2904000	from the perspective of a tea party
2904000	2906000	conservative versus a libertarian
2906000	2908000	and I will automatically change that
2908000	2912000	it's a universal translation engine as well
2912000	2914000	again, which is crazy
2914000	2916000	clearly, yeah
2916000	2918000	without question
2918000	2920000	okay, once we've got this technology
2920000	2922000	we've got another super trend
2922000	2924000	that's happening at the same time
2924000	2926000	there's a few super trends all happening
2926000	2928000	I call them the exponential age
2928000	2930000	one of them is compute power, all of this
2930000	2932000	so they all go together, the other one is robotics
2932000	2934000	so now, how close are we
2934000	2936000	to creating sentient robots
2936000	2938000	where is sentient
2938000	2940000	in this process
2940000	2942000	what's the definition of sentient
2942000	2944000	I don't know
2944000	2946000	we don't know, right
2946000	2948000	nobody knows what sentience is
2948000	2950000	there is no commonly defined thing
2950000	2952000	in terms of like
2952000	2954000	the things you see in the movies
2954000	2956000	nobody knows
2956000	2958000	because this is the thing
2958000	2960000	if you ask anyone how far away are we
2960000	2962000	from singularity or intelligence
2962000	2964000	people will say
2964000	2966000	at most, at minimum
2966000	2968000	18 months, right
2968000	2970000	why
2970000	2972000	because what possible information could you have
2972000	2974000	to say that a human level intelligence
2974000	2976000	is less than 12 months away
2976000	2978000	I'm not sure
2978000	2980000	and nobody's been able to tell me an answer
2980000	2982000	so, you know, this is
2982000	2984000	a case of we don't know, but what we do know is that
2984000	2986000	AI is getting better than humans at certain things
2986000	2988000	so like
2988000	2990000	open AI just released, maybe they were pressured
2990000	2992000	by someone, the open source version of the software
2992000	2994000	called whisper, which is
2994000	2996000	a dynamic transcription engine
2996000	2998000	you can speak in five different languages
2998000	3000000	in the same sentence and it will transcribe it
3000000	3002000	perfectly into English
3002000	3004000	it's actually got above human level transcription quality
3004000	3006000	and so
3006000	3008000	stable diffusion is above human level
3008000	3010000	image generation quality
3010000	3012000	GPT-3 is above human level
3012000	3014000	writing quality
3014000	3016000	when we combine those all together
3016000	3018000	you will get an illusion of sentience
3018000	3020000	because you can't tell it's not a human maybe
3020000	3022000	but is it really sentient and has agency
3022000	3024000	I don't know
3024000	3026000	and for the robotics thing, I think that Tesla's got
3026000	3028000	some much bigger plans than they're letting on
3028000	3030000	in regards to that
3030000	3032000	we're going to see some big speed ups
3032000	3034000	yeah, again I think people
3034000	3036000	people are
3036000	3038000	underestimating the speed of what is happening
3038000	3040000	and I think you've confirmed it to me
3040000	3042000	that the speed of which all of this is happening
3042000	3044000	is
3044000	3046000	ridiculous
3046000	3048000	it's a true
3048000	3050000	exponential, this is also actually
3050000	3052000	when you look at AI research papers
3052000	3054000	it's a doubling every 24 months
3054000	3056000	on that
3056000	3058000	so it actually is an exponential thing on AI research papers
3058000	3060000	when you plot it
3060000	3062000	on a log graph it's a straight line
3062000	3064000	so as this goes it will continue going exponential
3064000	3066000	and like I said exponentials are
3066000	3068000	a hell of a thing
3068000	3070000	we are not equipped to handle them
3070000	3072000	no and we've got too many, well too many
3072000	3074000	we're going to have the fastest pace of change
3074000	3076000	humanity's ever seen because of technology
3076000	3078000	because there's so many of these
3078000	3080000	all happening at the same time
3080000	3082000	it's a lot
3082000	3084000	even as everything else breaks down
3084000	3086000	all our systems are at the edge
3086000	3088000	of our stability
3088000	3090000	because I was like we need to reform education
3090000	3092000	healthcare and all these things quick
3092000	3094000	because we're going to see
3094000	3096000	this is not normal
3096000	3098000	what we're seeing today
3098000	3100000	they might say oh interest rates are 7%
3100000	3102000	worse than could happen
3102000	3104000	come on guys
3104000	3106000	these are symptoms not kind of causes
3106000	3108000	the reality is our systems are out
3108000	3110000	data need to be improved
3110000	3112000	so what happened with crypto is they tried to grow a whole new system
3112000	3114000	and then there's this system
3114000	3116000	that's made and lost
3116000	3118000	whereas this technology
3118000	3120000	because it can take unstructured data
3120000	3122000	to structured data
3122000	3124000	can sit in our systems and extend them
3124000	3126000	they can disrupt them or extend them
3126000	3128000	so it's really interesting
3128000	3130000	I think again the pace of change will be ridiculous
3130000	3132000	so how the hell would somebody like Real Vision
3132000	3134000	deal with
3134000	3136000	I mean every company in the world
3136000	3138000	has to change their business models yet again
3138000	3140000	people are changing to web 3
3140000	3142000	because that's another new business model
3142000	3144000	the application of technology at scale
3144000	3146000	in a totally disruptive way
3146000	3148000	how the hell do we all deal with it
3148000	3150000	how do we even get ahead
3150000	3152000	so the lovely thing is
3152000	3154000	when I go into the biggest media companies in the world
3154000	3156000	right now they've already prototyped the technology
3156000	3158000	internally because we made it so they could
3158000	3160000	this is a new internet that's coming
3160000	3162000	and so the reason I start stability
3162000	3164000	was to be the layer one for next generation AI
3164000	3166000	so my aim is to build the biggest company in the world
3166000	3168000	that puts this technology to everyone
3168000	3170000	so they can build their own models
3170000	3172000	or if they want the white glove service
3172000	3174000	they come to us and we forward deploy engineers
3174000	3176000	to take all the content in the world and make it living
3176000	3178000	and interactive
3178000	3180000	but you just kind of got to get into this
3180000	3182000	and again you know how it was when you said
3182000	3184000	the first bitcoin?
3184000	3186000	it's magic
3186000	3188000	sufficiently advanced technology is magic this is the same
3188000	3190000	when you create your first image
3190000	3192000	if you do something boring it's going to be like whatever
3192000	3194000	it's style transfer
3194000	3196000	but when you create your first original image
3196000	3198000	combining different styles and concepts
3198000	3200000	and the image in your head becomes reality
3200000	3202000	you're like
3202000	3204000	this is new
3204000	3206000	this is different this is crazy
3206000	3208000	it's the biggest thing of all time and it's not just for images
3208000	3210000	images are the
3210000	3212000	breakthrough wedge
3212000	3214000	because it's gone from 20% to 80%
3214000	3216000	language GPT-3 was an 80% to 90% moment
3216000	3218000	this is
3218000	3220000	99% of the world don't believe they can create
3220000	3222000	they can suddenly create anything
3222000	3224000	you got to just get in there and you got to basically find where it is
3224000	3226000	because what happens is that
3226000	3228000	there's this wonderful description of infrastructure
3228000	3230000	as the most efficient means by which a society stores
3230000	3232000	and ships value
3232000	3234000	the value landscape in content
3234000	3236000	in enterprise
3236000	3238000	in a lot of things
3238000	3240000	in information is about to be upended
3240000	3242000	and we don't know what the new landscape is
3242000	3244000	and so you got to be in there to understand that
3244000	3246000	what role do humans play
3248000	3250000	you know obviously we've got a shrinking world
3250000	3252000	population over time so
3252000	3254000	I think of robots and AI
3254000	3256000	and I wrote a few articles about it
3256000	3258000	so these are new demographics
3258000	3260000	but they can periferate very far
3260000	3262000	so does that increase
3262000	3264000	GDP growth and humans need to move
3264000	3266000	towards some sort of universal basic income
3266000	3268000	or different roles
3268000	3270000	how are you thinking that
3270000	3272000	I think that we need to move towards universal basic income
3272000	3274000	like you know this is why
3274000	3276000	I'm rolling this out in emerging markets
3276000	3278000	the education tablets create the best
3278000	3280000	data sets to feed models for every nation
3280000	3282000	so I'm going to make it to the Malawi
3282000	3284000	where it adds percentage points to its GDP
3284000	3286000	Ethiopia adds percentage points to their GDP
3286000	3288000	India is the number one market for this
3288000	3290000	because they have ATAR
3290000	3292000	India Stack 5G
3292000	3294000	and all the capital needed
3294000	3296000	so India is one of our biggest markets
3296000	3298000	by far and literally we will accelerate
3298000	3300000	Indian GDP and the Indians will then have a better system
3300000	3302000	than we have in the west
3302000	3304000	like already 13 months to literacy and numeracy
3304000	3306000	on one hour a day is better than
3306000	3308000	most primary you know kindergarten
3308000	3310000	so think about what it's going to be
3310000	3312000	self-learning AI system
3312000	3314000	it's going to be crazy but then they are equipped
3314000	3316000	for that and you need to have things like UBI
3316000	3318000	so one of the things we've done is in our country level
3318000	3320000	subsidiaries and we're doing just about all the countries in the world
3320000	3322000	10% of the shares are reserved
3322000	3324000	for the kids that use our education tablets
3324000	3326000	so they'll be getting shares
3326000	3328000	as they kind of grow
3328000	3330000	and then we're trying to figure out how UBI
3330000	3332000	looks like on the back of that which is insane
3332000	3334000	like we shouldn't have to do that
3334000	3336000	but nobody else is thinking about the pace of change
3336000	3338000	and scale of this
3338000	3340000	are you going to structure this as a DAO
3340000	3342000	or a foundation or something
3342000	3344000	I wanted to do a DAO of DAOs originally
3344000	3346000	and
3346000	3348000	then I realised the infrastructure wasn't there
3348000	3350000	and then I realised let's just
3350000	3352000	IPO in every single country
3352000	3354000	and create the next trillion dollar business
3354000	3356000	that's the best way to do this
3356000	3358000	distributed listing
3358000	3360000	okay interesting
3360000	3362000	yeah distributed listing
3362000	3364000	the Indian version of stability should be owned
3364000	3366000	by the Indians for the Indians
3366000	3368000	running it
3368000	3370000	there's an opportunity here
3370000	3372000	same for all these other countries
3372000	3374000	maybe DAOs work in the future
3374000	3376000	maybe you can do air drops
3376000	3378000	it's open right
3378000	3380000	but this is a cool thing this technology
3380000	3382000	has an exponential
3382000	3384000	so nobody knows
3384000	3386000	what the answer is
3386000	3388000	final question
3388000	3390000	because there's a lot to digest here
3390000	3392000	how are governments going to deal with this
3392000	3394000	so
3394000	3396000	the European Union
3396000	3398000	is trying to ban open source artificial intelligence now
3398000	3400000	because they view the edges
3400000	3402000	regulation
3402000	3404000	so authors of models will be liable
3404000	3406000	for the use of the models
3406000	3408000	the US is uncertain right now
3408000	3410000	the UK is massively pro AI
3410000	3412000	and so they've been upgrading it massively
3412000	3414000	in emerging markets
3414000	3416000	guess what
3416000	3418000	I'm going to the governments to tell them they can have this technology for free
3418000	3420000	they love me
3420000	3422000	so
3422000	3424000	you'll have most of the world loving it
3424000	3426000	and then Europe is a big question mark
3426000	3428000	US is a small question mark
3428000	3430000	and I think they'll be very pro this
3430000	3432000	because it adds GDP at a time
3432000	3434000	when there is no abundance
3434000	3436000	the question is does it then collapse GDP afterwards
3436000	3438000	politicians don't think that far
3438000	3440000	honestly
3440000	3442000	when I look at it
3442000	3444000	what is GDP
3444000	3446000	GDP is population growth plus productivity
3446000	3448000	this does both population growth
3448000	3450000	and productivity
3450000	3452000	because it is population
3452000	3454000	robots and AI are demographics
3454000	3456000	and increases productivity
3456000	3458000	so that should mean the pie increases
3458000	3460000	so per capita GDP rises
3460000	3462000	that's my working hypothesis
3462000	3464000	until
3464000	3466000	it replaces the humans eventually anyway
3466000	3468000	exactly and there's this other part
3468000	3470000	which is that basically the west
3470000	3472000	and advanced economies have borrowed too much from their balance sheet
3472000	3474000	from the future based on identity
3474000	3476000	whereas you look at India and other places
3476000	3478000	they haven't done that
3478000	3480000	so when you incorporate this technology
3480000	3482000	with godland entity structures
3482000	3484000	you suddenly have massive credit creation
3484000	3486000	like you've never seen before
3486000	3488000	because information which money
3488000	3490000	can flow much nicer around India
3490000	3492000	or fricking Ethiopia or anywhere else
3492000	3494000	especially because our tablets are standardized tablets
3494000	3496000	that we're deploying at scale
3496000	3498000	with a new type of bond
3498000	3500000	whereby you only pay based on outcomes if you're a donor
3500000	3502000	which is measured through the tablets
3502000	3504000	so my thing is like infrastructure
3504000	3506000	the west I have no idea what to do with
3506000	3508000	like I'm just going to the company
3508000	3510000	to say give me your content and let's share on this upside
3510000	3512000	but it's difficult to try
3512000	3514000	and fix the UK or US or Europe
3514000	3516000	and there's enough smart people there who can do that
3516000	3518000	Have an amazing conversation
3518000	3520000	I've absolutely loved it
3520000	3522000	I'm terrified and excited at the same time
3522000	3524000	which is what I was hoping
3524000	3526000	I'll definitely get you back
3526000	3528000	to talk more about this because
3528000	3530000	we barely scratched the surface
3530000	3532000	Yeah, no problem, like I said
3532000	3534000	we've tried it publicly, I think this is one of the first times
3534000	3536000	we're talking about actually the bigger plans
3536000	3538000	like I think we're recording this now
3538000	3540000	next week we do our big launch event
3540000	3542000	but everyone needs to know about this right
3542000	3544000	and everyone needs to participate
3544000	3546000	because this should be a communal effort
3546000	3548000	because we need to guide it together, right?
3548000	3550000	Exactly right, well listen
3550000	3552000	best of luck with everything
3552000	3554000	let's hope the unintended consequences
3554000	3556000	are not as bad as could be
3556000	3558000	we'll only find out but we're going down this path anyway
3558000	3560000	regardless so you might as well
3560000	3562000	tell us what the consequences are and not to the few
3562000	3564000	Exactly, cheers Rowell
3564000	3566000	Thank you my friend
3568000	3570000	There is so much to unpack
3570000	3572000	for an interview like this
3572000	3574000	Firstly
3574000	3576000	it shows that the hypothesis
3576000	3578000	that technological growth
3578000	3580000	is going exponential and it is not going to stop
3580000	3582000	regardless of what the central banks are doing
3582000	3584000	or inflation is doing
3584000	3586000	it's kind of irrelevant
3586000	3588000	when the speed of technological
3588000	3590000	technological adoption
3590000	3592000	is so rapid
3592000	3594000	and so truly extraordinary and profound
3596000	3598000	the way this is changing humanity
3598000	3600000	both from education
3600000	3602000	medical sciences
3602000	3604000	science in general
3604000	3606000	the creative industries, the media industry
3606000	3608000	everybody
3608000	3610000	this is again
3610000	3612000	happening on a scale like the internet
3612000	3614000	but maybe even more so
3614000	3616000	and we've got many of these technologies
3616000	3618000	all overlapping
3618000	3620000	as what I've talked about before
3620000	3622000	blockchain technology has been the fastest
3622000	3624000	adoption of any technology the world has ever seen
3624000	3626000	and looks like AI may even
3626000	3628000	exceed that
3628000	3630000	and then we've got robotics and space
3630000	3632000	and internet of things
3632000	3634000	and on and on and on
3634000	3636000	so
3636000	3638000	you can either fear this stuff
3638000	3640000	or you can use it
3640000	3642000	to your advantage and invest in your own future
3642000	3644000	and that's the route I take
3644000	3646000	there is unintended consequences
3646000	3648000	we just don't know what they are
3648000	3650000	and I think Emmad's point about
3650000	3652000	should it be given
3652000	3654000	to the few
3654000	3656000	or the many
3656000	3658000	to deal with those unintended consequences
3658000	3660000	I think he's probably right
3660000	3662000	that give it to everybody
3662000	3664000	is probably the only way around this
3664000	3666000	anyway, a truly extraordinary interview
3666000	3668000	and I hope you enjoyed it
3674000	3676000	with in-depth analysis from real experts
