0	5520	In 1997, Computer Deep Blue beat the highest-rated player at chess.
5520	9200	2011, Computer Watson beat champion players of Jeopardy.
9200	12960	2016, the game Go fell to the computer AlphaGo.
12960	18240	But these are just games. What about a demonstration of practical problem-solving?
18240	24320	Enter AlphaGeometry, an AI developed by DeepMind that can solve Olympiad-level geometry problems,
24320	27120	outperforming the average human participant.
27120	32480	This has been heralded as a massive leap in AI reasoning and a step towards artificial
32480	37760	general intelligence. But is it? I'll give my thoughts in this video.
37760	43520	Firstly, how does it work? No coverage I've seen actually goes into any detail of AlphaGeometry's
43520	48400	solutions. I went through them and it was so painful I feel it's only right that I inflict
48400	53600	that experience on others, but trust me, that pain is worth it as it will help us in the second half
53680	57440	of this video where we discuss whether this is actually a step forward in reasoning
57440	60160	and its potential impact on mathematics as a whole.
65040	69280	First, a brief look at how AlphaGeometry works and then a deep dive into one of the
69280	74080	Olympiad problems it solved. It is made up of two systems and I'll demonstrate what it might
74080	78880	look like if it tries to prove this well-known result. The first system is a language model
78960	85920	akin to a refined and specific use chat GPT. I suggest ideas like plot the midpoint of this line
85920	92000	or draw this diameter. The second is a symbolic deduction engine. I know a bunch of geometrical
92000	99200	theorems like M is the midpoint of AC, therefore AM equals CM. OA is a radius, this is a tangent,
99200	105600	therefore this is a right angle, therefore this is 90 subtract x. These two systems work in tandem
105600	110880	with the first making a suggestion. Let's draw these lines and the second making deductions
110880	117360	because M and O are midpoints, these lines are parallel and they repeat until the problem is
117360	125120	solved. Now let's draw this line. By Thales's theorem, this is 90. Angles in a triangle sum
125120	133040	to 180, so this must be x and by angles in the same segment, this is also x. Well done guys,
133040	139040	I don't always have the best ideas but we usually get there. I'm always right but my options are
139040	144640	limited by this absolute moron. Some commentators have likened this to a right brain generating
144640	150560	ideas and a left brain analyzing the facts. Let's see it in action with a more challenging problem.
150560	154880	The International Mathematical Olympiad is one of the world's toughest mathematics papers for
154880	160160	high school students with each paper containing six problems selected from four mathematical
160160	167440	domains. Let's focus on problem one of the 2008 paper since alpha geometry solved this in 40 steps
167440	172640	which is fairly close to its average of around 55 steps. Before we state the problem there might be
172640	178960	some language with which you're unfamiliar. So here's a quick rundown of some triangle properties.
178960	185920	Start with a triangle ABC and first it turns out that it can be embedded in a unique circle
186000	191440	called the circum circle and its center is called the circum center. The center is the intersection
191440	197600	of the perpendicular bisectors of the three edges and I'll leave it as an exercise to justify why.
197600	203840	Second a line from a vertex meeting the opposite edge at a right angle is called an altitude.
203840	210160	Every triangle has three and third it turns out that all three altitudes meet at a common point
210160	215280	called the orthocenter. Ortho meaning orthogonal meaning perpendicular meaning at right angles
215280	220400	you get the idea. Paul's here if you need to just digest this I'll summarize them here as
220400	224880	I'll be using them for the rest of the video. The extended cut of this video goes into a bit
224880	230000	more detail on these like why the circum circle and orthocenter even exist and if you want to
230000	235280	check that out as well as extended cuts of other videos please consider supporting me on Patreon.
235280	240560	So let's now look at this Olympiad problem. We'll start with some triangle ABC and plot its
240560	247520	orthocenter H. Take the midpoints of the three edges and label them A0, B0, C0 so that A0 is
247520	255760	opposite A, B0 is opposite B, C0 is opposite C. Now draw a circle centered at A0 which goes through
255760	262880	H. Now this circle will cross BC twice called these points A1 and A2. Note these needn't
262880	268480	actually be on the triangle. In an obtuse triangle they might drift outside but we plot them anyway.
269120	276320	Now draw circles centered at B0 and C0 each crossing H and plot B1 and B2, C1 and C2 in the
276320	283520	same fashion as A1 and A2. These problems really tend to front load a lot of information so pause
283520	290560	and digest this if you need to because now here's the question. We want to prove that A1, A2, B1,
290560	299280	B2, C1 and C2 all lie on a circle. In Geogebra we can see that this seems to be true but our task
299280	304800	is to prove it. Pause now if you want to have a crack at it then we'll look at Alpha Geometry's
304800	310720	solution. So how did Alpha Geometry solve this problem? Well first it's worth noting that in the
310720	316320	paper on Alpha Geometry the problem is stated differently just wanting to prove that B1, B2,
316320	323040	C1 and C2 are cyclic. This is insufficient. By symmetry a proof of this kind will generalize
323040	328800	to the other pairs of sides but it could be the case that the A's and B's, the A's and C's and
328800	334640	the B's and C's share different circles but anyway maybe they'll justify why this is sufficient
334640	340800	later. Just a few things to mention up front. There are often a few redundant steps along the
341280	347120	way. It often restates things already deduced. This is due to how it presents solutions but I'll
347120	353440	mostly just gloss over them and sometimes compress steps together but I will show all steps on screen
353440	358800	if you care about the minutiae. I'll assume a high school knowledge of geometry throughout,
358800	365280	the results we'll need will be summarized here. One to draw your attention to is cyclic quadrilaterals.
365280	370240	Most of us learn that opposite angles in a cyclic quadrilateral sum to 180 but the
370240	376640	converse is also true. If you have a quadrilateral where opposite angles sum to 180 then it is
376640	381920	cyclic. That's less obvious and it's going to be very important. I will be going through the steps
381920	388160	fairly quickly. Now each step is fairly simple but the length of the proof is quite overwhelming.
388160	393680	My advice is not to worry about every little detail and just get a feel for Alpha geometry's
393680	399600	approach but feel free to pause after every step if you want to fully grasp every detail.
399600	405920	I'll use lowercase Greek letters for angles and I'll use a star to denote a supplementary angle,
405920	412560	i.e. Alpha star is 180 subtract Alpha. Let's get into it. We actually don't need these altitudes
412560	420400	so I'll hide them and it starts by defining point O such that EH equals EO. So clearly O must lie on
420400	427120	this left circle but also such that HO is perpendicular to EF. I think we can infer that
427120	431680	O is actually where these circles intersect but Alpha geometry doesn't realize this yet.
431680	438560	Step one is realizing that O must lie on the left hand circle so that's good. And step two,
438560	445600	it uses angles in the same segment to prove that these are the same. I'll call them Alpha. Also
445600	451520	this is a cyclic quadrilateral so these angles are supplementary. They sum to 180. I'll call them
451600	458960	Beta and Beta star. Step three, this triangle is isosceles as EB2 and EH are both radii of this
458960	465680	circle so these angles are the same and I'll call them Gamma. Steps four and five, here it infers
465680	472000	that this angle is also Gamma. Again this is by angles in the same segment. Steps six to eight,
472000	477920	it deduces that EF is parallel to BC by acknowledging that E and F are midpoints
477920	482400	of those lines of the triangle. Steps nine and 10 are some of the redundant steps I mentioned
482400	488800	earlier. And step 11, we have that this is a right angle and that's by Thales's theorem.
488800	496480	Angles in a semicircle are 90 degrees. Step 12, AH is perpendicular to EF. That's because AH and
496480	502320	BC are perpendicular by the definition of an altitude. BC and EF are parallel so that angle
502320	510640	must also be 90. Step 13, now this one is interesting. We extend the line B2O to EF. I
510640	514720	guess that's the right brain talking. We've run out of angles to chase so let's just stick another
514720	521360	line in. Now what's this angle here? Well we have a right angle triangle so this is 90 subtract
521360	527520	Gamma but here is another right angle triangle so this angle must be 90 subtract 90 subtract Gamma.
527520	533920	In other words, it's Gamma. Steps 14 to 16 use this common right angle here to establish that
533920	540720	AH is parallel to OH. The diagram is awkward here because it looks like this is necessarily the case
540720	548480	and it is but alpha geometry didn't know that yet. Steps 17 and 18, this is a right angle and again
548480	555360	that's by Thales's theorem. Steps 19 to 22 are more redundant restatements and step 23,
555360	562480	this is an isosceles triangle as EB2 and EO are radii so these base angles are the same and I'll
562480	568960	call them Delta. Steps 24 and 25, now this is a brilliant inference and that's that this angle
568960	574880	is also Delta. All it says is justification is that these are Delta and these are Gamma so why
574880	580880	must this be Delta? Well here's a triangle with Gamma and Delta so its third angle supplements
580880	587600	them but now here's a triangle with Gamma and this angle so its third angle must be Delta as
587600	594480	required. Step 26, again another fantastic inference and that's that EF bisects this angle here. Now
594480	600160	why is that? Well call the top one Epsilon, yes that's how many of us Brits pronounce it and
600160	607680	note this triangle up here whose top angle is Delta star so Epsilon supplements Gamma and Delta star
607680	614800	and now note this triangle also with Gamma and Delta star so this angle must be Epsilon as well.
614800	620000	It's great stuff, I mean we can infer this so much more easily but it is kind of cute how
620000	625760	Alpha Geometry picks the most difficult ways to get there. Step 27, because F lies on the angle
625760	633360	bisector of EO and EH and because EO and EH are the same length we have that FO and FH are also
633360	640560	the same length and step 28 therefore O lies on this right hand circle. Remember when we said
640560	644800	as much at the very beginning? I told you we'd get there eventually. Okay so it's putting a
644800	650720	lot of pieces together and step 29 what does it do with this newfound power? Well what do you think?
650720	658560	It's straight back to chasing the angles so plot C2O and HC1. Now these are the same via angles
658560	664800	in the same segment and I'll call them zeta. Steps 30 and 31 these are clearly the same as
664800	672080	they're both zeta star and as a result these angles are the same I'll call them eta and why is that?
672080	679600	Well consider this triangle and call its top angle theta then eta supplements theta and zeta star.
679600	685280	Now consider this triangle and we see that this angle also supplements theta and zeta star so it
685280	691600	must also be eta but I need the whole Greek alphabet at this rate. Steps 32 because these
691600	699040	triangles have the same angles they are similar and that's expressed as this ratio AH over AC1
699040	705680	equals AC2 over AO. Steps 33 and 34 this is quite fiddly but we're doing a similar thing on the left
705680	711520	as we did on the right with the zetas so call this top angle kappa and fill in this angle which we
711520	718000	know is beta we'll need it in just a second. This angle is 90 plus alpha and we see that it is in a
718000	724960	triangle with beta and kappa but this angle is also in a triangle with beta and kappa so it must
724960	732160	also be 90 plus alpha. Steps 35 similar to before no pun intended these two triangles have the same
732160	740080	angles so they are similar and that's expressed as AH over AB1 equals AB2 over AO. Steps 36 now
740080	747840	a bit of algebra we see that AH times AO is equal to AB1 times AB2 and AC1 times AC2
747840	757120	therefore AB1 over AC2 is equal to AC1 over AB2. Steps 37 and 38 we will use this ratio so construct
757120	764960	B2C1 and B1C2 and this ratio tells us that these triangles are similar thus their angles are the
764960	772640	same in particular these ones which I'll call lambda. Steps 39 so close this angle supplements
772640	782560	lambda so I'll call it lambda star and step 40 finally we have a quadrilateral B1B2C1C2 with
782560	793600	opposite supplementary angles thus it is cyclic thus these four points lie on a circle. Finally
793680	799440	so what do we think about this proof well for a start it doesn't really answer the question
799440	806560	there is no demonstration that A1 and A2 must lie on this circle now this is easy to argue because
806560	814240	consider any circle containing A1 and A2 then A1 A2 is a chord of the circle and its perpendicular
814240	822080	bisector must contain the center but A1 A2 is a diameter of this circle centered at A0 therefore
822080	829040	A0 lies on this perpendicular bisector but recall that A0 is the midpoint of BC thus this is actually
829040	835680	the perpendicular bisector of BC we conclude that any circle containing A1 and A2 must be
835680	841680	centered on the perpendicular bisector of BC repeating the argument for the other sides any
841680	847040	circle containing all six points must be centered where all three of these perpendicular bisectors
847040	854160	meet which is the circum center so all three circles must coincide so alpha geometry successfully
854160	859440	solves this problem which isn't exactly the same as stated in the olympiad paper and i don't like
859440	865200	how the writers have simplified the problem yes it turns out that it is a solution in this case
865200	871200	but that requires justification and they haven't given any the next thing to say about alpha
871200	877280	geometry's proof is that it's quite meandering to say the least it isn't so much a solution
877280	882640	but more like watching someone else solve the problem in real time when we're solving problems
882640	888560	we don't always have the best idea first so we tinker and meddle and hope that our ideas go
888560	894560	somewhere what i'd love to see is that if later versions of alpha geometry can refine the solutions
894560	901920	into something more palatable for example consider this step one define o as the second
901920	910160	intersection of these circles and step two e h f o is a kite so its diagonals o h and e f are
910160	915680	perpendicular this is well known or provable in just a few steps and if we can assume things like
915680	921920	thales's theorem i think we can assume this step three e and f are midpoints so e f is parallel to
921920	929120	bc and step four altitude a h is perpendicular to bc by definition which means it's perpendicular
929120	936560	to e f since o h and a h are both perpendicular to e f they are parallel and both pass through
936560	944720	h so in fact a o and h are collinear steps five and six establish the beaters as before
944720	950880	so these triangles with beta and kappa are similar expressed as follows and steps seven and eight
950880	957520	establish the zetas as before so these triangles with zeta star and theta are similar express as
957520	964240	follows steps nine and ten chase these ratios to establish similarity of these triangles as before
964240	971200	step 11 establish the lambdas as before and step 12 establish this quadrilateral as cyclic
971200	976000	and we're done i'm sure we could shorten this further but without much thought i took this
976000	982720	from 40 steps to 12 with the benefit of hindsight but my main issue with this proof is that the
982720	990480	reason why the result is true doesn't leap out at me a good proof should show why the result holds
990480	997440	the logic should enlighten us and i don't find this particularly illuminating however this does
997440	1003760	veer close to my favorite solution to the problem consider the intersecting second theorem this
1003760	1009440	says that if you have two non-parallel second lines one meeting the circle at a and b and the other
1009440	1017680	at x and y and crossing at p then the following holds ap times bp is equal to xp times yp the
1017680	1025120	converse is also true if five points have this property then those four points are necessarily
1025120	1031760	cyclic with that in mind once we establish that a o and h are collinear we have by the intersecting
1031760	1038320	second theorem that ab one times ab two is equal to a o times a h and ac one times ac two is equal
1038320	1045600	to a o times a h thus ab one times ab two equals ac one times ac two and by the converse of the
1045600	1052080	intersecting second theorem these points are cyclic this proof was written by a human and there is a
1052080	1058880	wealth of other succinct and creative proofs out there but most importantly this is a proof that to
1058880	1065600	me finally does the job of telling me why the result is true i can see it right in front of me
1065600	1071040	these seconds always combining at a vertex and therefore giving rise to this specific circle
1071040	1077280	in the middle all who love mathematics love the spark of insight that proofs like this give us
1077280	1082720	we don't want to just learn the results we want to experience the unique joy of resonating with
1082720	1091280	this kind of logical poetry it's beautiful this isn't but is that a problem after all it got the
1091280	1097360	answer and it did so in this unique way of combining creativity with deduction so let's now take a
1097360	1103360	broader look at what i think alpha geometry means for ai and what it means for mathematics let me
1103360	1109600	just remind you that i am not a computer scientist i am a mathematician first and foremost everything
1109600	1115040	that follows in this video is just like my opinion man let me loop back to something i said at the
1115040	1120960	start of the video the previous ai's learned to play games while this one can solve problems
1120960	1126800	well is alpha geometry really solving problems because it looks like what it's doing is brute
1126800	1132080	forcing its way around the angles and eventually landing on the result but isn't that what problem
1132080	1138800	solving is alpha geometry solutions are pretty haphazard and lacking in any general direction
1138800	1146240	look at this solution for problem three of 2015's imo horrendous but if you try these problems
1146240	1152000	what do your initial attempts look like i think for most of us we just get our hands dirty and
1152000	1157040	work out a bunch of lengths and angles before we have a good idea we might have slightly more
1157040	1162800	direction and intent behind our choices but is our approach radically different to alpha
1162880	1169920	geometries i don't think so and i find this aspect of alpha geometry impressive and fascinating
1169920	1176800	a less impressive aspect of alpha geometry is that plain geometry is easy to codify in terms
1176800	1181840	of strict rules and results i mean it's kind of telling that the oldest recorded axiomatic
1181840	1188080	approach to mathematics is euclid's elements and that begins with plain geometry olympiad problems
1188080	1194080	are kind of like games we know they have an answer we know they are solvable with high school level
1194080	1200000	results because that's how they are designed for the language model right brain there are only
1200000	1205040	certain things you can try and certain things that you need to try compare this to analytic
1205040	1211280	number theory or algebraic geometry where problems demand ideas that are way out there this is to say
1211280	1216880	that i don't think alpha geometries achievements can be immediately generalized to other fields of
1216880	1222400	study no more than chess computed deep blue could attempt to play go for this reason that
1222400	1228880	i respectfully disagree with some other commentators on this topic subina hossenfelder for example had
1228880	1236240	this to say about alpha geometry it generally highlights ai's growing ability to reason logically
1236240	1242720	discover new knowledge and verify solutions and not only this it can also explain how it arrived
1242720	1249360	as a conclusion such a type of ai system has users that extends beyond geometry not only can this
1249360	1255760	achievement be generalized across various mathematical domains but it will without doubt also come in
1255760	1263440	handy in other areas where rational thinking and logical deduction is of use like everything high
1263440	1270160	school level plain geometry questions which remember are written to be solvable are comparatively easy
1270160	1275520	and there is currently no evidence to suggest that this technique can be generalized at this present
1275520	1280320	time now i'm not so naive to think that things will be different in the near future especially
1280320	1286640	given the rate of ai progress so maybe soon an ai can tackle something like algebraic geometry
1286640	1293120	but not right now a computer brute-forced chess but it still took 20 years before a computer
1293520	1301360	one at go here alpha geometry is answering geometry questions by well not quite brute force but it's
1301360	1306640	similar and i think that we're still a while away from seeing ai have a go at some of the
1306640	1312320	unsolved problems across mathematics i come to think of it given all the operations alpha geometry
1312320	1317520	can do every second it's still surprising to me that it still can't outperform the best humans
1318080	1323600	how weird would it have been if ibm announced that its computer deep blue attempted to beat
1323600	1330080	gary kasparov but came second no the victory over the champion was the milestone i'm not
1330080	1334400	taken away from the achievements in this paper i just think our excitement should be tempered
1334400	1341680	a little in my mind this is a small step beyond beating games like go not a radical leap forward
1341680	1346880	it's natural then to ask about the future and whether ai will tackle unsolved problems
1346960	1351520	those of you who have read the paper will know that alpha geometry developed many synthetic
1351520	1358240	theorems results proved from its foundation that help it make inferences it even discovered
1358240	1363840	a new result in this question because its solution doesn't require one of the premises
1363840	1368160	i'd be gubsmacked if the question setters didn't already know about this and just added this
1368160	1374560	constraint to tune the difficulty of the question but is this a sign of ai eventually being used
1374560	1380400	to solve open questions and is that a good thing well the first thing i foresee is ai assisted
1380400	1386000	proofs these fall into a similar region of computer assisted proofs but there might be a difference
1386000	1391440	computer assists are basically time savers the four color theorem for example required a lot of
1391440	1397600	pen and paper research to break down the number of cases each of which could then be checked by hand
1397600	1402880	but a computer can do it much faster so it's more practical even simulations and data analyses
1402880	1407680	essentially boil down to just doing a lot of calculations which could be done by hand if we
1407680	1413440	had infinite mathematicians writing on infinite blackboards but we do it by computer to save time
1413440	1419440	a computer is just part of the equipment of the modern 21st century mathematician along
1419440	1424720	with chalk and blackboard along with traditional computer assists ai assists might be considered
1424720	1430960	part of our tool set as well but ai might replace some of the creativity involved and so would a
1430960	1438720	purely generated ai proof it feels like cheating but is that a bad thing well we need to ask why
1438720	1444800	do we bother solving hard problems other than to satiate our curiosity i think there are three
1444800	1451680	reasons the first is that they have immediate practical value these are things like optimization
1451680	1457520	problems that could revolutionize aspects of computing or cracking the enigma code it shortened
1457600	1464480	the war direct impact a non-mathematical example would be curing a disease it's just good the
1464480	1470320	benefits are immediate and tangible the second reason is that the theory or techniques we develop
1470320	1476000	in order to solve them could be used elsewhere this is the spin-off effect proving firmars last
1476000	1481280	year and for example required several leaps that connected many areas of mathematics and improved
1481280	1486080	our overall understanding a non-mathematical example might be that we didn't really gain
1486080	1492560	any practical value from armstrong setting foot on the moon but many innovations were required
1492560	1498480	to get in there which have everyday use thirdly most importantly for me as a pure mathematician
1498480	1504560	and a reason i think is overlooked it's just good to solve problems you know it's the old
1504560	1509040	why climb Everest because it's there even without the innovations required for the
1509040	1514640	Apollo missions i still find the moon landing endlessly inspiring maybe the proof of the
1514640	1520000	collet's conjecture won't directly impact my life in the slightest but i'll still find the event
1520000	1525520	enormously inspiring nonetheless basically the reason we solve problems and really the reason
1525520	1531280	we do anything is either because it's useful or because it's beautiful or it's neither like my
1531280	1538320	phd thesis but still both reasons are valuable so here's my take on ai in mathematics if a solution
1538320	1544400	to a problem has immediate practical value we should use ai and cheat and get the answer
1544400	1550000	who cares if we look up the answer to a disease cure it'll save lives the second case gets a
1550000	1556720	bit weird though i worry that ai assisted proofs might not develop interesting spin-off theory
1556720	1563520	and instead force the solution out of pre-existing knowledge when humans puzzle for a long time
1563520	1569840	they force themselves to be creative and that's where the new theory lies ai might get the answer
1569840	1576080	with a messy and haphazard application of more basic stuff so we miss out on potential new techniques
1576640	1582240	this isn't exactly the same but by analogy it's like this geometry problem did you know the
1582240	1587200	intersecting second theorem before you saw this proof you might have done but alpha geometry on
1587200	1592400	the other hand applied the same few results over and over admittedly that's just my opinion i don't
1592400	1598400	really have any direct evidence of this but we are already starting to see stagnation in other areas
1598400	1604720	of ai generated content but my main reservation with ai generated proofs is this third point
1604720	1610080	the beauty i know alpha geometry wasn't designed to create beautiful proofs and again this is just
1610080	1616320	my opinion but i want to convince you why beauty really matters imagine if an artist composed the
1616320	1622160	greatest painting ever there is likely no practical value to be found in the painting or in any of
1622160	1627520	the techniques developed to compose it but we wouldn't say that it's pointless as an enormous
1627600	1634000	cultural contribution it would still enrich our lives in ways beyond what is practical well
1634000	1639280	mathematics is part of our culture has your life tangibly and practically improved because
1639280	1646080	wiles proved firmars last theorem probably not but the story likely inspired you the result was
1646080	1652640	as much an enriching cultural contribution as a great piece of art would the story have inspired
1652640	1659840	you if an ai had proved firmars last theorem and this is again where i disagree with sabina i know
1659840	1666800	this last comment was a bit of a joke but rational thinking and logical deduction aren't useful for
1666800	1673680	everything i can't rationally convince you why this proof is beautiful to me it just is and nor
1673680	1679920	can i convince you why alpha geometries proofs are ugly and does this matter yes because we're in the
1679920	1685120	land of plain geometry which isn't some untapped wilderness of mathematical usefulness it's a
1685120	1691520	playground squarely in the domain of beauty and what makes something beautiful i don't know it
1691520	1696960	isn't the length of the proof as shorter isn't always better and it isn't simplicity as too
1696960	1703040	simple often hides or disguises the inner workings we just know it when we see it and i don't think
1703040	1709280	ai has come close to capturing beauty yet there's a line about aesthetics in the alpha geometry paper
1709280	1714400	how alpha geometry might discover some plain geometry results overlooked by us humans because
1714400	1719920	it isn't biased towards symmetry or that which is aesthetically pleasing and great you do you
1719920	1725520	alpha geometry but if it isn't aesthetically pleasing why do we care mathematics is often seen
1725520	1731680	as something that's purely logical it's black and white and we love it for that but we also love
1731680	1737680	it for the aesthetics like be honest if i made a video saying here's an ugly geometrical result
1737680	1743600	and here are the 100 difficult steps it takes to get there would you care about that no i
1743600	1750000	curate topics that expose mathematical beauty even when the solution is kind of ugly i try to make
1750000	1755200	every step intuitive so we can appreciate the symmetry the hidden magic and the beauty within
1756000	1762800	three blue one browns video on collisions printing pie it's a jaw dropping result but we all watched
1762800	1768640	the whole video because the real or comes not from seeing the answer but from seeing why
1769360	1776640	that's what we love that's what inspires us not this i want to be super clear here i am not
1776640	1782560	criticizing alpha geometry or the authors of this paper alpha geometry wasn't designed to
1782560	1787040	create beautiful mathematics it was designed to solve olympiad problems and it does that pretty
1787840	1793840	all i'm saying is that while ai might be close to solving problems i think it's far from solving
1793840	1800560	problems beautifully this is where my concerns lie and why i'm not yet excited about ai generated
1800560	1806800	proofs to me mathematics is the most creative and beautiful thing there is my qualms echo those
1806800	1812960	who love visual art music and film and fear that artists musicians writers and actors will be replaced
1812960	1821280	by ai this replacement will be a cultural net negative if ai also solves our mathematical problems
1821280	1827600	we might sacrifice their cultural impact as well thank you so much for watching a bit of a different
1827600	1833440	video this time because i wanted to respond to the news i think alpha geometry is a fascinating new
1833440	1839760	approach but the more i thought about it the more i felt i needed to say so i hope you enjoyed and
1839760	1844240	if you disagree with my take that's absolutely fine let me know down in the comments and keep the
1844240	1849120	discussion respectful a massive thank you to all my patrons who keep the channel alive if you'd
1849120	1854400	like to support me you'll get your name in the credits access to extended cuts of select videos
