In 1997, Computer Deep Blue beat the highest-rated player at chess.

00:05.520 --> 00:09.200
2011, Computer Watson beat champion players of Jeopardy.

00:09.200 --> 00:12.960
2016, the game Go fell to the computer AlphaGo.

00:12.960 --> 00:18.240
But these are just games. What about a demonstration of practical problem-solving?

00:18.240 --> 00:24.320
Enter AlphaGeometry, an AI developed by DeepMind that can solve Olympiad-level geometry problems,

00:24.320 --> 00:27.120
outperforming the average human participant.

00:27.120 --> 00:32.480
This has been heralded as a massive leap in AI reasoning and a step towards artificial

00:32.480 --> 00:37.760
general intelligence. But is it? I'll give my thoughts in this video.

00:37.760 --> 00:43.520
Firstly, how does it work? No coverage I've seen actually goes into any detail of AlphaGeometry's

00:43.520 --> 00:48.400
solutions. I went through them and it was so painful I feel it's only right that I inflict

00:48.400 --> 00:53.600
that experience on others, but trust me, that pain is worth it as it will help us in the second half

00:53.680 --> 00:57.440
of this video where we discuss whether this is actually a step forward in reasoning

00:57.440 --> 01:00.160
and its potential impact on mathematics as a whole.

01:05.040 --> 01:09.280
First, a brief look at how AlphaGeometry works and then a deep dive into one of the

01:09.280 --> 01:14.080
Olympiad problems it solved. It is made up of two systems and I'll demonstrate what it might

01:14.080 --> 01:18.880
look like if it tries to prove this well-known result. The first system is a language model

01:18.960 --> 01:25.920
akin to a refined and specific use chat GPT. I suggest ideas like plot the midpoint of this line

01:25.920 --> 01:32.000
or draw this diameter. The second is a symbolic deduction engine. I know a bunch of geometrical

01:32.000 --> 01:39.200
theorems like M is the midpoint of AC, therefore AM equals CM. OA is a radius, this is a tangent,

01:39.200 --> 01:45.600
therefore this is a right angle, therefore this is 90 subtract x. These two systems work in tandem

01:45.600 --> 01:50.880
with the first making a suggestion. Let's draw these lines and the second making deductions

01:50.880 --> 01:57.360
because M and O are midpoints, these lines are parallel and they repeat until the problem is

01:57.360 --> 02:05.120
solved. Now let's draw this line. By Thales's theorem, this is 90. Angles in a triangle sum

02:05.120 --> 02:13.040
to 180, so this must be x and by angles in the same segment, this is also x. Well done guys,

02:13.040 --> 02:19.040
I don't always have the best ideas but we usually get there. I'm always right but my options are

02:19.040 --> 02:24.640
limited by this absolute moron. Some commentators have likened this to a right brain generating

02:24.640 --> 02:30.560
ideas and a left brain analyzing the facts. Let's see it in action with a more challenging problem.

02:30.560 --> 02:34.880
The International Mathematical Olympiad is one of the world's toughest mathematics papers for

02:34.880 --> 02:40.160
high school students with each paper containing six problems selected from four mathematical

02:40.160 --> 02:47.440
domains. Let's focus on problem one of the 2008 paper since alpha geometry solved this in 40 steps

02:47.440 --> 02:52.640
which is fairly close to its average of around 55 steps. Before we state the problem there might be

02:52.640 --> 02:58.960
some language with which you're unfamiliar. So here's a quick rundown of some triangle properties.

02:58.960 --> 03:05.920
Start with a triangle ABC and first it turns out that it can be embedded in a unique circle

03:06.000 --> 03:11.440
called the circum circle and its center is called the circum center. The center is the intersection

03:11.440 --> 03:17.600
of the perpendicular bisectors of the three edges and I'll leave it as an exercise to justify why.

03:17.600 --> 03:23.840
Second a line from a vertex meeting the opposite edge at a right angle is called an altitude.

03:23.840 --> 03:30.160
Every triangle has three and third it turns out that all three altitudes meet at a common point

03:30.160 --> 03:35.280
called the orthocenter. Ortho meaning orthogonal meaning perpendicular meaning at right angles

03:35.280 --> 03:40.400
you get the idea. Paul's here if you need to just digest this I'll summarize them here as

03:40.400 --> 03:44.880
I'll be using them for the rest of the video. The extended cut of this video goes into a bit

03:44.880 --> 03:50.000
more detail on these like why the circum circle and orthocenter even exist and if you want to

03:50.000 --> 03:55.280
check that out as well as extended cuts of other videos please consider supporting me on Patreon.

03:55.280 --> 04:00.560
So let's now look at this Olympiad problem. We'll start with some triangle ABC and plot its

04:00.560 --> 04:07.520
orthocenter H. Take the midpoints of the three edges and label them A0, B0, C0 so that A0 is

04:07.520 --> 04:15.760
opposite A, B0 is opposite B, C0 is opposite C. Now draw a circle centered at A0 which goes through

04:15.760 --> 04:22.880
H. Now this circle will cross BC twice called these points A1 and A2. Note these needn't

04:22.880 --> 04:28.480
actually be on the triangle. In an obtuse triangle they might drift outside but we plot them anyway.

04:29.120 --> 04:36.320
Now draw circles centered at B0 and C0 each crossing H and plot B1 and B2, C1 and C2 in the

04:36.320 --> 04:43.520
same fashion as A1 and A2. These problems really tend to front load a lot of information so pause

04:43.520 --> 04:50.560
and digest this if you need to because now here's the question. We want to prove that A1, A2, B1,

04:50.560 --> 04:59.280
B2, C1 and C2 all lie on a circle. In Geogebra we can see that this seems to be true but our task

04:59.280 --> 05:04.800
is to prove it. Pause now if you want to have a crack at it then we'll look at Alpha Geometry's

05:04.800 --> 05:10.720
solution. So how did Alpha Geometry solve this problem? Well first it's worth noting that in the

05:10.720 --> 05:16.320
paper on Alpha Geometry the problem is stated differently just wanting to prove that B1, B2,

05:16.320 --> 05:23.040
C1 and C2 are cyclic. This is insufficient. By symmetry a proof of this kind will generalize

05:23.040 --> 05:28.800
to the other pairs of sides but it could be the case that the A's and B's, the A's and C's and

05:28.800 --> 05:34.640
the B's and C's share different circles but anyway maybe they'll justify why this is sufficient

05:34.640 --> 05:40.800
later. Just a few things to mention up front. There are often a few redundant steps along the

05:41.280 --> 05:47.120
way. It often restates things already deduced. This is due to how it presents solutions but I'll

05:47.120 --> 05:53.440
mostly just gloss over them and sometimes compress steps together but I will show all steps on screen

05:53.440 --> 05:58.800
if you care about the minutiae. I'll assume a high school knowledge of geometry throughout,

05:58.800 --> 06:05.280
the results we'll need will be summarized here. One to draw your attention to is cyclic quadrilaterals.

06:05.280 --> 06:10.240
Most of us learn that opposite angles in a cyclic quadrilateral sum to 180 but the

06:10.240 --> 06:16.640
converse is also true. If you have a quadrilateral where opposite angles sum to 180 then it is

06:16.640 --> 06:21.920
cyclic. That's less obvious and it's going to be very important. I will be going through the steps

06:21.920 --> 06:28.160
fairly quickly. Now each step is fairly simple but the length of the proof is quite overwhelming.

06:28.160 --> 06:33.680
My advice is not to worry about every little detail and just get a feel for Alpha geometry's

06:33.680 --> 06:39.600
approach but feel free to pause after every step if you want to fully grasp every detail.

06:39.600 --> 06:45.920
I'll use lowercase Greek letters for angles and I'll use a star to denote a supplementary angle,

06:45.920 --> 06:52.560
i.e. Alpha star is 180 subtract Alpha. Let's get into it. We actually don't need these altitudes

06:52.560 --> 07:00.400
so I'll hide them and it starts by defining point O such that EH equals EO. So clearly O must lie on

07:00.400 --> 07:07.120
this left circle but also such that HO is perpendicular to EF. I think we can infer that

07:07.120 --> 07:11.680
O is actually where these circles intersect but Alpha geometry doesn't realize this yet.

07:11.680 --> 07:18.560
Step one is realizing that O must lie on the left hand circle so that's good. And step two,

07:18.560 --> 07:25.600
it uses angles in the same segment to prove that these are the same. I'll call them Alpha. Also

07:25.600 --> 07:31.520
this is a cyclic quadrilateral so these angles are supplementary. They sum to 180. I'll call them

07:31.600 --> 07:38.960
Beta and Beta star. Step three, this triangle is isosceles as EB2 and EH are both radii of this

07:38.960 --> 07:45.680
circle so these angles are the same and I'll call them Gamma. Steps four and five, here it infers

07:45.680 --> 07:52.000
that this angle is also Gamma. Again this is by angles in the same segment. Steps six to eight,

07:52.000 --> 07:57.920
it deduces that EF is parallel to BC by acknowledging that E and F are midpoints

07:57.920 --> 08:02.400
of those lines of the triangle. Steps nine and 10 are some of the redundant steps I mentioned

08:02.400 --> 08:08.800
earlier. And step 11, we have that this is a right angle and that's by Thales's theorem.

08:08.800 --> 08:16.480
Angles in a semicircle are 90 degrees. Step 12, AH is perpendicular to EF. That's because AH and

08:16.480 --> 08:22.320
BC are perpendicular by the definition of an altitude. BC and EF are parallel so that angle

08:22.320 --> 08:30.640
must also be 90. Step 13, now this one is interesting. We extend the line B2O to EF. I

08:30.640 --> 08:34.720
guess that's the right brain talking. We've run out of angles to chase so let's just stick another

08:34.720 --> 08:41.360
line in. Now what's this angle here? Well we have a right angle triangle so this is 90 subtract

08:41.360 --> 08:47.520
Gamma but here is another right angle triangle so this angle must be 90 subtract 90 subtract Gamma.

08:47.520 --> 08:53.920
In other words, it's Gamma. Steps 14 to 16 use this common right angle here to establish that

08:53.920 --> 09:00.720
AH is parallel to OH. The diagram is awkward here because it looks like this is necessarily the case

09:00.720 --> 09:08.480
and it is but alpha geometry didn't know that yet. Steps 17 and 18, this is a right angle and again

09:08.480 --> 09:15.360
that's by Thales's theorem. Steps 19 to 22 are more redundant restatements and step 23,

09:15.360 --> 09:22.480
this is an isosceles triangle as EB2 and EO are radii so these base angles are the same and I'll

09:22.480 --> 09:28.960
call them Delta. Steps 24 and 25, now this is a brilliant inference and that's that this angle

09:28.960 --> 09:34.880
is also Delta. All it says is justification is that these are Delta and these are Gamma so why

09:34.880 --> 09:40.880
must this be Delta? Well here's a triangle with Gamma and Delta so its third angle supplements

09:40.880 --> 09:47.600
them but now here's a triangle with Gamma and this angle so its third angle must be Delta as

09:47.600 --> 09:54.480
required. Step 26, again another fantastic inference and that's that EF bisects this angle here. Now

09:54.480 --> 10:00.160
why is that? Well call the top one Epsilon, yes that's how many of us Brits pronounce it and

10:00.160 --> 10:07.680
note this triangle up here whose top angle is Delta star so Epsilon supplements Gamma and Delta star

10:07.680 --> 10:14.800
and now note this triangle also with Gamma and Delta star so this angle must be Epsilon as well.

10:14.800 --> 10:20.000
It's great stuff, I mean we can infer this so much more easily but it is kind of cute how

10:20.000 --> 10:25.760
Alpha Geometry picks the most difficult ways to get there. Step 27, because F lies on the angle

10:25.760 --> 10:33.360
bisector of EO and EH and because EO and EH are the same length we have that FO and FH are also

10:33.360 --> 10:40.560
the same length and step 28 therefore O lies on this right hand circle. Remember when we said

10:40.560 --> 10:44.800
as much at the very beginning? I told you we'd get there eventually. Okay so it's putting a

10:44.800 --> 10:50.720
lot of pieces together and step 29 what does it do with this newfound power? Well what do you think?

10:50.720 --> 10:58.560
It's straight back to chasing the angles so plot C2O and HC1. Now these are the same via angles

10:58.560 --> 11:04.800
in the same segment and I'll call them zeta. Steps 30 and 31 these are clearly the same as

11:04.800 --> 11:12.080
they're both zeta star and as a result these angles are the same I'll call them eta and why is that?

11:12.080 --> 11:19.600
Well consider this triangle and call its top angle theta then eta supplements theta and zeta star.

11:19.600 --> 11:25.280
Now consider this triangle and we see that this angle also supplements theta and zeta star so it

11:25.280 --> 11:31.600
must also be eta but I need the whole Greek alphabet at this rate. Steps 32 because these

11:31.600 --> 11:39.040
triangles have the same angles they are similar and that's expressed as this ratio AH over AC1

11:39.040 --> 11:45.680
equals AC2 over AO. Steps 33 and 34 this is quite fiddly but we're doing a similar thing on the left

11:45.680 --> 11:51.520
as we did on the right with the zetas so call this top angle kappa and fill in this angle which we

11:51.520 --> 11:58.000
know is beta we'll need it in just a second. This angle is 90 plus alpha and we see that it is in a

11:58.000 --> 12:04.960
triangle with beta and kappa but this angle is also in a triangle with beta and kappa so it must

12:04.960 --> 12:12.160
also be 90 plus alpha. Steps 35 similar to before no pun intended these two triangles have the same

12:12.160 --> 12:20.080
angles so they are similar and that's expressed as AH over AB1 equals AB2 over AO. Steps 36 now

12:20.080 --> 12:27.840
a bit of algebra we see that AH times AO is equal to AB1 times AB2 and AC1 times AC2

12:27.840 --> 12:37.120
therefore AB1 over AC2 is equal to AC1 over AB2. Steps 37 and 38 we will use this ratio so construct

12:37.120 --> 12:44.960
B2C1 and B1C2 and this ratio tells us that these triangles are similar thus their angles are the

12:44.960 --> 12:52.640
same in particular these ones which I'll call lambda. Steps 39 so close this angle supplements

12:52.640 --> 13:02.560
lambda so I'll call it lambda star and step 40 finally we have a quadrilateral B1B2C1C2 with

13:02.560 --> 13:13.600
opposite supplementary angles thus it is cyclic thus these four points lie on a circle. Finally

13:13.680 --> 13:19.440
so what do we think about this proof well for a start it doesn't really answer the question

13:19.440 --> 13:26.560
there is no demonstration that A1 and A2 must lie on this circle now this is easy to argue because

13:26.560 --> 13:34.240
consider any circle containing A1 and A2 then A1 A2 is a chord of the circle and its perpendicular

13:34.240 --> 13:42.080
bisector must contain the center but A1 A2 is a diameter of this circle centered at A0 therefore

13:42.080 --> 13:49.040
A0 lies on this perpendicular bisector but recall that A0 is the midpoint of BC thus this is actually

13:49.040 --> 13:55.680
the perpendicular bisector of BC we conclude that any circle containing A1 and A2 must be

13:55.680 --> 14:01.680
centered on the perpendicular bisector of BC repeating the argument for the other sides any

14:01.680 --> 14:07.040
circle containing all six points must be centered where all three of these perpendicular bisectors

14:07.040 --> 14:14.160
meet which is the circum center so all three circles must coincide so alpha geometry successfully

14:14.160 --> 14:19.440
solves this problem which isn't exactly the same as stated in the olympiad paper and i don't like

14:19.440 --> 14:25.200
how the writers have simplified the problem yes it turns out that it is a solution in this case

14:25.200 --> 14:31.200
but that requires justification and they haven't given any the next thing to say about alpha

14:31.200 --> 14:37.280
geometry's proof is that it's quite meandering to say the least it isn't so much a solution

14:37.280 --> 14:42.640
but more like watching someone else solve the problem in real time when we're solving problems

14:42.640 --> 14:48.560
we don't always have the best idea first so we tinker and meddle and hope that our ideas go

14:48.560 --> 14:54.560
somewhere what i'd love to see is that if later versions of alpha geometry can refine the solutions

14:54.560 --> 15:01.920
into something more palatable for example consider this step one define o as the second

15:01.920 --> 15:10.160
intersection of these circles and step two e h f o is a kite so its diagonals o h and e f are

15:10.160 --> 15:15.680
perpendicular this is well known or provable in just a few steps and if we can assume things like

15:15.680 --> 15:21.920
thales's theorem i think we can assume this step three e and f are midpoints so e f is parallel to

15:21.920 --> 15:29.120
bc and step four altitude a h is perpendicular to bc by definition which means it's perpendicular

15:29.120 --> 15:36.560
to e f since o h and a h are both perpendicular to e f they are parallel and both pass through

15:36.560 --> 15:44.720
h so in fact a o and h are collinear steps five and six establish the beaters as before

15:44.720 --> 15:50.880
so these triangles with beta and kappa are similar expressed as follows and steps seven and eight

15:50.880 --> 15:57.520
establish the zetas as before so these triangles with zeta star and theta are similar express as

15:57.520 --> 16:04.240
follows steps nine and ten chase these ratios to establish similarity of these triangles as before

16:04.240 --> 16:11.200
step 11 establish the lambdas as before and step 12 establish this quadrilateral as cyclic

16:11.200 --> 16:16.000
and we're done i'm sure we could shorten this further but without much thought i took this

16:16.000 --> 16:22.720
from 40 steps to 12 with the benefit of hindsight but my main issue with this proof is that the

16:22.720 --> 16:30.480
reason why the result is true doesn't leap out at me a good proof should show why the result holds

16:30.480 --> 16:37.440
the logic should enlighten us and i don't find this particularly illuminating however this does

16:37.440 --> 16:43.760
veer close to my favorite solution to the problem consider the intersecting second theorem this

16:43.760 --> 16:49.440
says that if you have two non-parallel second lines one meeting the circle at a and b and the other

16:49.440 --> 16:57.680
at x and y and crossing at p then the following holds ap times bp is equal to xp times yp the

16:57.680 --> 17:05.120
converse is also true if five points have this property then those four points are necessarily

17:05.120 --> 17:11.760
cyclic with that in mind once we establish that a o and h are collinear we have by the intersecting

17:11.760 --> 17:18.320
second theorem that ab one times ab two is equal to a o times a h and ac one times ac two is equal

17:18.320 --> 17:25.600
to a o times a h thus ab one times ab two equals ac one times ac two and by the converse of the

17:25.600 --> 17:32.080
intersecting second theorem these points are cyclic this proof was written by a human and there is a

17:32.080 --> 17:38.880
wealth of other succinct and creative proofs out there but most importantly this is a proof that to

17:38.880 --> 17:45.600
me finally does the job of telling me why the result is true i can see it right in front of me

17:45.600 --> 17:51.040
these seconds always combining at a vertex and therefore giving rise to this specific circle

17:51.040 --> 17:57.280
in the middle all who love mathematics love the spark of insight that proofs like this give us

17:57.280 --> 18:02.720
we don't want to just learn the results we want to experience the unique joy of resonating with

18:02.720 --> 18:11.280
this kind of logical poetry it's beautiful this isn't but is that a problem after all it got the

18:11.280 --> 18:17.360
answer and it did so in this unique way of combining creativity with deduction so let's now take a

18:17.360 --> 18:23.360
broader look at what i think alpha geometry means for ai and what it means for mathematics let me

18:23.360 --> 18:29.600
just remind you that i am not a computer scientist i am a mathematician first and foremost everything

18:29.600 --> 18:35.040
that follows in this video is just like my opinion man let me loop back to something i said at the

18:35.040 --> 18:40.960
start of the video the previous ai's learned to play games while this one can solve problems

18:40.960 --> 18:46.800
well is alpha geometry really solving problems because it looks like what it's doing is brute

18:46.800 --> 18:52.080
forcing its way around the angles and eventually landing on the result but isn't that what problem

18:52.080 --> 18:58.800
solving is alpha geometry solutions are pretty haphazard and lacking in any general direction

18:58.800 --> 19:06.240
look at this solution for problem three of 2015's imo horrendous but if you try these problems

19:06.240 --> 19:12.000
what do your initial attempts look like i think for most of us we just get our hands dirty and

19:12.000 --> 19:17.040
work out a bunch of lengths and angles before we have a good idea we might have slightly more

19:17.040 --> 19:22.800
direction and intent behind our choices but is our approach radically different to alpha

19:22.880 --> 19:29.920
geometries i don't think so and i find this aspect of alpha geometry impressive and fascinating

19:29.920 --> 19:36.800
a less impressive aspect of alpha geometry is that plain geometry is easy to codify in terms

19:36.800 --> 19:41.840
of strict rules and results i mean it's kind of telling that the oldest recorded axiomatic

19:41.840 --> 19:48.080
approach to mathematics is euclid's elements and that begins with plain geometry olympiad problems

19:48.080 --> 19:54.080
are kind of like games we know they have an answer we know they are solvable with high school level

19:54.080 --> 20:00.000
results because that's how they are designed for the language model right brain there are only

20:00.000 --> 20:05.040
certain things you can try and certain things that you need to try compare this to analytic

20:05.040 --> 20:11.280
number theory or algebraic geometry where problems demand ideas that are way out there this is to say

20:11.280 --> 20:16.880
that i don't think alpha geometries achievements can be immediately generalized to other fields of

20:16.880 --> 20:22.400
study no more than chess computed deep blue could attempt to play go for this reason that

20:22.400 --> 20:28.880
i respectfully disagree with some other commentators on this topic subina hossenfelder for example had

20:28.880 --> 20:36.240
this to say about alpha geometry it generally highlights ai's growing ability to reason logically

20:36.240 --> 20:42.720
discover new knowledge and verify solutions and not only this it can also explain how it arrived

20:42.720 --> 20:49.360
as a conclusion such a type of ai system has users that extends beyond geometry not only can this

20:49.360 --> 20:55.760
achievement be generalized across various mathematical domains but it will without doubt also come in

20:55.760 --> 21:03.440
handy in other areas where rational thinking and logical deduction is of use like everything high

21:03.440 --> 21:10.160
school level plain geometry questions which remember are written to be solvable are comparatively easy

21:10.160 --> 21:15.520
and there is currently no evidence to suggest that this technique can be generalized at this present

21:15.520 --> 21:20.320
time now i'm not so naive to think that things will be different in the near future especially

21:20.320 --> 21:26.640
given the rate of ai progress so maybe soon an ai can tackle something like algebraic geometry

21:26.640 --> 21:33.120
but not right now a computer brute-forced chess but it still took 20 years before a computer

21:33.520 --> 21:41.360
one at go here alpha geometry is answering geometry questions by well not quite brute force but it's

21:41.360 --> 21:46.640
similar and i think that we're still a while away from seeing ai have a go at some of the

21:46.640 --> 21:52.320
unsolved problems across mathematics i come to think of it given all the operations alpha geometry

21:52.320 --> 21:57.520
can do every second it's still surprising to me that it still can't outperform the best humans

21:58.080 --> 22:03.600
how weird would it have been if ibm announced that its computer deep blue attempted to beat

22:03.600 --> 22:10.080
gary kasparov but came second no the victory over the champion was the milestone i'm not

22:10.080 --> 22:14.400
taken away from the achievements in this paper i just think our excitement should be tempered

22:14.400 --> 22:21.680
a little in my mind this is a small step beyond beating games like go not a radical leap forward

22:21.680 --> 22:26.880
it's natural then to ask about the future and whether ai will tackle unsolved problems

22:26.960 --> 22:31.520
those of you who have read the paper will know that alpha geometry developed many synthetic

22:31.520 --> 22:38.240
theorems results proved from its foundation that help it make inferences it even discovered

22:38.240 --> 22:43.840
a new result in this question because its solution doesn't require one of the premises

22:43.840 --> 22:48.160
i'd be gubsmacked if the question setters didn't already know about this and just added this

22:48.160 --> 22:54.560
constraint to tune the difficulty of the question but is this a sign of ai eventually being used

22:54.560 --> 23:00.400
to solve open questions and is that a good thing well the first thing i foresee is ai assisted

23:00.400 --> 23:06.000
proofs these fall into a similar region of computer assisted proofs but there might be a difference

23:06.000 --> 23:11.440
computer assists are basically time savers the four color theorem for example required a lot of

23:11.440 --> 23:17.600
pen and paper research to break down the number of cases each of which could then be checked by hand

23:17.600 --> 23:22.880
but a computer can do it much faster so it's more practical even simulations and data analyses

23:22.880 --> 23:27.680
essentially boil down to just doing a lot of calculations which could be done by hand if we

23:27.680 --> 23:33.440
had infinite mathematicians writing on infinite blackboards but we do it by computer to save time

23:33.440 --> 23:39.440
a computer is just part of the equipment of the modern 21st century mathematician along

23:39.440 --> 23:44.720
with chalk and blackboard along with traditional computer assists ai assists might be considered

23:44.720 --> 23:50.960
part of our tool set as well but ai might replace some of the creativity involved and so would a

23:50.960 --> 23:58.720
purely generated ai proof it feels like cheating but is that a bad thing well we need to ask why

23:58.720 --> 24:04.800
do we bother solving hard problems other than to satiate our curiosity i think there are three

24:04.800 --> 24:11.680
reasons the first is that they have immediate practical value these are things like optimization

24:11.680 --> 24:17.520
problems that could revolutionize aspects of computing or cracking the enigma code it shortened

24:17.600 --> 24:24.480
the war direct impact a non-mathematical example would be curing a disease it's just good the

24:24.480 --> 24:30.320
benefits are immediate and tangible the second reason is that the theory or techniques we develop

24:30.320 --> 24:36.000
in order to solve them could be used elsewhere this is the spin-off effect proving firmars last

24:36.000 --> 24:41.280
year and for example required several leaps that connected many areas of mathematics and improved

24:41.280 --> 24:46.080
our overall understanding a non-mathematical example might be that we didn't really gain

24:46.080 --> 24:52.560
any practical value from armstrong setting foot on the moon but many innovations were required

24:52.560 --> 24:58.480
to get in there which have everyday use thirdly most importantly for me as a pure mathematician

24:58.480 --> 25:04.560
and a reason i think is overlooked it's just good to solve problems you know it's the old

25:04.560 --> 25:09.040
why climb Everest because it's there even without the innovations required for the

25:09.040 --> 25:14.640
Apollo missions i still find the moon landing endlessly inspiring maybe the proof of the

25:14.640 --> 25:20.000
collet's conjecture won't directly impact my life in the slightest but i'll still find the event

25:20.000 --> 25:25.520
enormously inspiring nonetheless basically the reason we solve problems and really the reason

25:25.520 --> 25:31.280
we do anything is either because it's useful or because it's beautiful or it's neither like my

25:31.280 --> 25:38.320
phd thesis but still both reasons are valuable so here's my take on ai in mathematics if a solution

25:38.320 --> 25:44.400
to a problem has immediate practical value we should use ai and cheat and get the answer

25:44.400 --> 25:50.000
who cares if we look up the answer to a disease cure it'll save lives the second case gets a

25:50.000 --> 25:56.720
bit weird though i worry that ai assisted proofs might not develop interesting spin-off theory

25:56.720 --> 26:03.520
and instead force the solution out of pre-existing knowledge when humans puzzle for a long time

26:03.520 --> 26:09.840
they force themselves to be creative and that's where the new theory lies ai might get the answer

26:09.840 --> 26:16.080
with a messy and haphazard application of more basic stuff so we miss out on potential new techniques

26:16.640 --> 26:22.240
this isn't exactly the same but by analogy it's like this geometry problem did you know the

26:22.240 --> 26:27.200
intersecting second theorem before you saw this proof you might have done but alpha geometry on

26:27.200 --> 26:32.400
the other hand applied the same few results over and over admittedly that's just my opinion i don't

26:32.400 --> 26:38.400
really have any direct evidence of this but we are already starting to see stagnation in other areas

26:38.400 --> 26:44.720
of ai generated content but my main reservation with ai generated proofs is this third point

26:44.720 --> 26:50.080
the beauty i know alpha geometry wasn't designed to create beautiful proofs and again this is just

26:50.080 --> 26:56.320
my opinion but i want to convince you why beauty really matters imagine if an artist composed the

26:56.320 --> 27:02.160
greatest painting ever there is likely no practical value to be found in the painting or in any of

27:02.160 --> 27:07.520
the techniques developed to compose it but we wouldn't say that it's pointless as an enormous

27:07.600 --> 27:14.000
cultural contribution it would still enrich our lives in ways beyond what is practical well

27:14.000 --> 27:19.280
mathematics is part of our culture has your life tangibly and practically improved because

27:19.280 --> 27:26.080
wiles proved firmars last theorem probably not but the story likely inspired you the result was

27:26.080 --> 27:32.640
as much an enriching cultural contribution as a great piece of art would the story have inspired

27:32.640 --> 27:39.840
you if an ai had proved firmars last theorem and this is again where i disagree with sabina i know

27:39.840 --> 27:46.800
this last comment was a bit of a joke but rational thinking and logical deduction aren't useful for

27:46.800 --> 27:53.680
everything i can't rationally convince you why this proof is beautiful to me it just is and nor

27:53.680 --> 27:59.920
can i convince you why alpha geometries proofs are ugly and does this matter yes because we're in the

27:59.920 --> 28:05.120
land of plain geometry which isn't some untapped wilderness of mathematical usefulness it's a

28:05.120 --> 28:11.520
playground squarely in the domain of beauty and what makes something beautiful i don't know it

28:11.520 --> 28:16.960
isn't the length of the proof as shorter isn't always better and it isn't simplicity as too

28:16.960 --> 28:23.040
simple often hides or disguises the inner workings we just know it when we see it and i don't think

28:23.040 --> 28:29.280
ai has come close to capturing beauty yet there's a line about aesthetics in the alpha geometry paper

28:29.280 --> 28:34.400
how alpha geometry might discover some plain geometry results overlooked by us humans because

28:34.400 --> 28:39.920
it isn't biased towards symmetry or that which is aesthetically pleasing and great you do you

28:39.920 --> 28:45.520
alpha geometry but if it isn't aesthetically pleasing why do we care mathematics is often seen

28:45.520 --> 28:51.680
as something that's purely logical it's black and white and we love it for that but we also love

28:51.680 --> 28:57.680
it for the aesthetics like be honest if i made a video saying here's an ugly geometrical result

28:57.680 --> 29:03.600
and here are the 100 difficult steps it takes to get there would you care about that no i

29:03.600 --> 29:10.000
curate topics that expose mathematical beauty even when the solution is kind of ugly i try to make

29:10.000 --> 29:15.200
every step intuitive so we can appreciate the symmetry the hidden magic and the beauty within

29:16.000 --> 29:22.800
three blue one browns video on collisions printing pie it's a jaw dropping result but we all watched

29:22.800 --> 29:28.640
the whole video because the real or comes not from seeing the answer but from seeing why

29:29.360 --> 29:36.640
that's what we love that's what inspires us not this i want to be super clear here i am not

29:36.640 --> 29:42.560
criticizing alpha geometry or the authors of this paper alpha geometry wasn't designed to

29:42.560 --> 29:47.040
create beautiful mathematics it was designed to solve olympiad problems and it does that pretty

29:47.840 --> 29:53.840
all i'm saying is that while ai might be close to solving problems i think it's far from solving

29:53.840 --> 30:00.560
problems beautifully this is where my concerns lie and why i'm not yet excited about ai generated

30:00.560 --> 30:06.800
proofs to me mathematics is the most creative and beautiful thing there is my qualms echo those

30:06.800 --> 30:12.960
who love visual art music and film and fear that artists musicians writers and actors will be replaced

30:12.960 --> 30:21.280
by ai this replacement will be a cultural net negative if ai also solves our mathematical problems

30:21.280 --> 30:27.600
we might sacrifice their cultural impact as well thank you so much for watching a bit of a different

30:27.600 --> 30:33.440
video this time because i wanted to respond to the news i think alpha geometry is a fascinating new

30:33.440 --> 30:39.760
approach but the more i thought about it the more i felt i needed to say so i hope you enjoyed and

30:39.760 --> 30:44.240
