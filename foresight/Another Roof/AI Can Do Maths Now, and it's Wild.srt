00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,520
In 1997, Computer Deep Blue beat the highest-rated player at chess.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:09,200
2011, Computer Watson beat champion players of Jeopardy.

3
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:12,960
2016, the game Go fell to the computer AlphaGo.

4
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:18,240
But these are just games. What about a demonstration of practical problem-solving?

5
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:24,320
Enter AlphaGeometry, an AI developed by DeepMind that can solve Olympiad-level geometry problems,

6
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:27,120
outperforming the average human participant.

7
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:32,480
This has been heralded as a massive leap in AI reasoning and a step towards artificial

8
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:37,760
general intelligence. But is it? I'll give my thoughts in this video.

9
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:43,520
Firstly, how does it work? No coverage I've seen actually goes into any detail of AlphaGeometry's

10
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:48,400
solutions. I went through them and it was so painful I feel it's only right that I inflict

11
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:53,600
that experience on others, but trust me, that pain is worth it as it will help us in the second half

12
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:57,440
of this video where we discuss whether this is actually a step forward in reasoning

13
00:00:57,440 --> 00:01:00,160
and its potential impact on mathematics as a whole.

14
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:09,280
First, a brief look at how AlphaGeometry works and then a deep dive into one of the

15
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:14,080
Olympiad problems it solved. It is made up of two systems and I'll demonstrate what it might

16
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:18,880
look like if it tries to prove this well-known result. The first system is a language model

17
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:25,920
akin to a refined and specific use chat GPT. I suggest ideas like plot the midpoint of this line

18
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:32,000
or draw this diameter. The second is a symbolic deduction engine. I know a bunch of geometrical

19
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:39,200
theorems like M is the midpoint of AC, therefore AM equals CM. OA is a radius, this is a tangent,

20
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:45,600
therefore this is a right angle, therefore this is 90 subtract x. These two systems work in tandem

21
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:50,880
with the first making a suggestion. Let's draw these lines and the second making deductions

22
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:57,360
because M and O are midpoints, these lines are parallel and they repeat until the problem is

23
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:05,120
solved. Now let's draw this line. By Thales's theorem, this is 90. Angles in a triangle sum

24
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:13,040
to 180, so this must be x and by angles in the same segment, this is also x. Well done guys,

25
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:19,040
I don't always have the best ideas but we usually get there. I'm always right but my options are

26
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:24,640
limited by this absolute moron. Some commentators have likened this to a right brain generating

27
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:30,560
ideas and a left brain analyzing the facts. Let's see it in action with a more challenging problem.

28
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:34,880
The International Mathematical Olympiad is one of the world's toughest mathematics papers for

29
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:40,160
high school students with each paper containing six problems selected from four mathematical

30
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:47,440
domains. Let's focus on problem one of the 2008 paper since alpha geometry solved this in 40 steps

31
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:52,640
which is fairly close to its average of around 55 steps. Before we state the problem there might be

32
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:58,960
some language with which you're unfamiliar. So here's a quick rundown of some triangle properties.

33
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:05,920
Start with a triangle ABC and first it turns out that it can be embedded in a unique circle

34
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:11,440
called the circum circle and its center is called the circum center. The center is the intersection

35
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:17,600
of the perpendicular bisectors of the three edges and I'll leave it as an exercise to justify why.

36
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:23,840
Second a line from a vertex meeting the opposite edge at a right angle is called an altitude.

37
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:30,160
Every triangle has three and third it turns out that all three altitudes meet at a common point

38
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:35,280
called the orthocenter. Ortho meaning orthogonal meaning perpendicular meaning at right angles

39
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:40,400
you get the idea. Paul's here if you need to just digest this I'll summarize them here as

40
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:44,880
I'll be using them for the rest of the video. The extended cut of this video goes into a bit

41
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:50,000
more detail on these like why the circum circle and orthocenter even exist and if you want to

42
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:55,280
check that out as well as extended cuts of other videos please consider supporting me on Patreon.

43
00:03:55,280 --> 00:04:00,560
So let's now look at this Olympiad problem. We'll start with some triangle ABC and plot its

44
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:07,520
orthocenter H. Take the midpoints of the three edges and label them A0, B0, C0 so that A0 is

45
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:15,760
opposite A, B0 is opposite B, C0 is opposite C. Now draw a circle centered at A0 which goes through

46
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:22,880
H. Now this circle will cross BC twice called these points A1 and A2. Note these needn't

47
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:28,480
actually be on the triangle. In an obtuse triangle they might drift outside but we plot them anyway.

48
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:36,320
Now draw circles centered at B0 and C0 each crossing H and plot B1 and B2, C1 and C2 in the

49
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:43,520
same fashion as A1 and A2. These problems really tend to front load a lot of information so pause

50
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:50,560
and digest this if you need to because now here's the question. We want to prove that A1, A2, B1,

51
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:59,280
B2, C1 and C2 all lie on a circle. In Geogebra we can see that this seems to be true but our task

52
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:04,800
is to prove it. Pause now if you want to have a crack at it then we'll look at Alpha Geometry's

53
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:10,720
solution. So how did Alpha Geometry solve this problem? Well first it's worth noting that in the

54
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:16,320
paper on Alpha Geometry the problem is stated differently just wanting to prove that B1, B2,

55
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:23,040
C1 and C2 are cyclic. This is insufficient. By symmetry a proof of this kind will generalize

56
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:28,800
to the other pairs of sides but it could be the case that the A's and B's, the A's and C's and

57
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:34,640
the B's and C's share different circles but anyway maybe they'll justify why this is sufficient

58
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:40,800
later. Just a few things to mention up front. There are often a few redundant steps along the

59
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:47,120
way. It often restates things already deduced. This is due to how it presents solutions but I'll

60
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:53,440
mostly just gloss over them and sometimes compress steps together but I will show all steps on screen

61
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:58,800
if you care about the minutiae. I'll assume a high school knowledge of geometry throughout,

62
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:05,280
the results we'll need will be summarized here. One to draw your attention to is cyclic quadrilaterals.

63
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:10,240
Most of us learn that opposite angles in a cyclic quadrilateral sum to 180 but the

64
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:16,640
converse is also true. If you have a quadrilateral where opposite angles sum to 180 then it is

65
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:21,920
cyclic. That's less obvious and it's going to be very important. I will be going through the steps

66
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:28,160
fairly quickly. Now each step is fairly simple but the length of the proof is quite overwhelming.

67
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:33,680
My advice is not to worry about every little detail and just get a feel for Alpha geometry's

68
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:39,600
approach but feel free to pause after every step if you want to fully grasp every detail.

69
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:45,920
I'll use lowercase Greek letters for angles and I'll use a star to denote a supplementary angle,

70
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:52,560
i.e. Alpha star is 180 subtract Alpha. Let's get into it. We actually don't need these altitudes

71
00:06:52,560 --> 00:07:00,400
so I'll hide them and it starts by defining point O such that EH equals EO. So clearly O must lie on

72
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:07,120
this left circle but also such that HO is perpendicular to EF. I think we can infer that

73
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:11,680
O is actually where these circles intersect but Alpha geometry doesn't realize this yet.

74
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:18,560
Step one is realizing that O must lie on the left hand circle so that's good. And step two,

75
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:25,600
it uses angles in the same segment to prove that these are the same. I'll call them Alpha. Also

76
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:31,520
this is a cyclic quadrilateral so these angles are supplementary. They sum to 180. I'll call them

77
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:38,960
Beta and Beta star. Step three, this triangle is isosceles as EB2 and EH are both radii of this

78
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:45,680
circle so these angles are the same and I'll call them Gamma. Steps four and five, here it infers

79
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:52,000
that this angle is also Gamma. Again this is by angles in the same segment. Steps six to eight,

80
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:57,920
it deduces that EF is parallel to BC by acknowledging that E and F are midpoints

81
00:07:57,920 --> 00:08:02,400
of those lines of the triangle. Steps nine and 10 are some of the redundant steps I mentioned

82
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:08,800
earlier. And step 11, we have that this is a right angle and that's by Thales's theorem.

83
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:16,480
Angles in a semicircle are 90 degrees. Step 12, AH is perpendicular to EF. That's because AH and

84
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:22,320
BC are perpendicular by the definition of an altitude. BC and EF are parallel so that angle

85
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:30,640
must also be 90. Step 13, now this one is interesting. We extend the line B2O to EF. I

86
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:34,720
guess that's the right brain talking. We've run out of angles to chase so let's just stick another

87
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:41,360
line in. Now what's this angle here? Well we have a right angle triangle so this is 90 subtract

88
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:47,520
Gamma but here is another right angle triangle so this angle must be 90 subtract 90 subtract Gamma.

89
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:53,920
In other words, it's Gamma. Steps 14 to 16 use this common right angle here to establish that

90
00:08:53,920 --> 00:09:00,720
AH is parallel to OH. The diagram is awkward here because it looks like this is necessarily the case

91
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:08,480
and it is but alpha geometry didn't know that yet. Steps 17 and 18, this is a right angle and again

92
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:15,360
that's by Thales's theorem. Steps 19 to 22 are more redundant restatements and step 23,

93
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:22,480
this is an isosceles triangle as EB2 and EO are radii so these base angles are the same and I'll

94
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:28,960
call them Delta. Steps 24 and 25, now this is a brilliant inference and that's that this angle

95
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:34,880
is also Delta. All it says is justification is that these are Delta and these are Gamma so why

96
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:40,880
must this be Delta? Well here's a triangle with Gamma and Delta so its third angle supplements

97
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:47,600
them but now here's a triangle with Gamma and this angle so its third angle must be Delta as

98
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:54,480
required. Step 26, again another fantastic inference and that's that EF bisects this angle here. Now

99
00:09:54,480 --> 00:10:00,160
why is that? Well call the top one Epsilon, yes that's how many of us Brits pronounce it and

100
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:07,680
note this triangle up here whose top angle is Delta star so Epsilon supplements Gamma and Delta star

101
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:14,800
and now note this triangle also with Gamma and Delta star so this angle must be Epsilon as well.

102
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:20,000
It's great stuff, I mean we can infer this so much more easily but it is kind of cute how

103
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:25,760
Alpha Geometry picks the most difficult ways to get there. Step 27, because F lies on the angle

104
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:33,360
bisector of EO and EH and because EO and EH are the same length we have that FO and FH are also

105
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:40,560
the same length and step 28 therefore O lies on this right hand circle. Remember when we said

106
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:44,800
as much at the very beginning? I told you we'd get there eventually. Okay so it's putting a

107
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:50,720
lot of pieces together and step 29 what does it do with this newfound power? Well what do you think?

108
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:58,560
It's straight back to chasing the angles so plot C2O and HC1. Now these are the same via angles

109
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:04,800
in the same segment and I'll call them zeta. Steps 30 and 31 these are clearly the same as

110
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:12,080
they're both zeta star and as a result these angles are the same I'll call them eta and why is that?

111
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:19,600
Well consider this triangle and call its top angle theta then eta supplements theta and zeta star.

112
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:25,280
Now consider this triangle and we see that this angle also supplements theta and zeta star so it

113
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:31,600
must also be eta but I need the whole Greek alphabet at this rate. Steps 32 because these

114
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:39,040
triangles have the same angles they are similar and that's expressed as this ratio AH over AC1

115
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:45,680
equals AC2 over AO. Steps 33 and 34 this is quite fiddly but we're doing a similar thing on the left

116
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:51,520
as we did on the right with the zetas so call this top angle kappa and fill in this angle which we

117
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:58,000
know is beta we'll need it in just a second. This angle is 90 plus alpha and we see that it is in a

118
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:04,960
triangle with beta and kappa but this angle is also in a triangle with beta and kappa so it must

119
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:12,160
also be 90 plus alpha. Steps 35 similar to before no pun intended these two triangles have the same

120
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:20,080
angles so they are similar and that's expressed as AH over AB1 equals AB2 over AO. Steps 36 now

121
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:27,840
a bit of algebra we see that AH times AO is equal to AB1 times AB2 and AC1 times AC2

122
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:37,120
therefore AB1 over AC2 is equal to AC1 over AB2. Steps 37 and 38 we will use this ratio so construct

123
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:44,960
B2C1 and B1C2 and this ratio tells us that these triangles are similar thus their angles are the

124
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:52,640
same in particular these ones which I'll call lambda. Steps 39 so close this angle supplements

125
00:12:52,640 --> 00:13:02,560
lambda so I'll call it lambda star and step 40 finally we have a quadrilateral B1B2C1C2 with

126
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:13,600
opposite supplementary angles thus it is cyclic thus these four points lie on a circle. Finally

127
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:19,440
so what do we think about this proof well for a start it doesn't really answer the question

128
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:26,560
there is no demonstration that A1 and A2 must lie on this circle now this is easy to argue because

129
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:34,240
consider any circle containing A1 and A2 then A1 A2 is a chord of the circle and its perpendicular

130
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:42,080
bisector must contain the center but A1 A2 is a diameter of this circle centered at A0 therefore

131
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:49,040
A0 lies on this perpendicular bisector but recall that A0 is the midpoint of BC thus this is actually

132
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:55,680
the perpendicular bisector of BC we conclude that any circle containing A1 and A2 must be

133
00:13:55,680 --> 00:14:01,680
centered on the perpendicular bisector of BC repeating the argument for the other sides any

134
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:07,040
circle containing all six points must be centered where all three of these perpendicular bisectors

135
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:14,160
meet which is the circum center so all three circles must coincide so alpha geometry successfully

136
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:19,440
solves this problem which isn't exactly the same as stated in the olympiad paper and i don't like

137
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:25,200
how the writers have simplified the problem yes it turns out that it is a solution in this case

138
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:31,200
but that requires justification and they haven't given any the next thing to say about alpha

139
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:37,280
geometry's proof is that it's quite meandering to say the least it isn't so much a solution

140
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:42,640
but more like watching someone else solve the problem in real time when we're solving problems

141
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:48,560
we don't always have the best idea first so we tinker and meddle and hope that our ideas go

142
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:54,560
somewhere what i'd love to see is that if later versions of alpha geometry can refine the solutions

143
00:14:54,560 --> 00:15:01,920
into something more palatable for example consider this step one define o as the second

144
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:10,160
intersection of these circles and step two e h f o is a kite so its diagonals o h and e f are

145
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:15,680
perpendicular this is well known or provable in just a few steps and if we can assume things like

146
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:21,920
thales's theorem i think we can assume this step three e and f are midpoints so e f is parallel to

147
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:29,120
bc and step four altitude a h is perpendicular to bc by definition which means it's perpendicular

148
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:36,560
to e f since o h and a h are both perpendicular to e f they are parallel and both pass through

149
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:44,720
h so in fact a o and h are collinear steps five and six establish the beaters as before

150
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:50,880
so these triangles with beta and kappa are similar expressed as follows and steps seven and eight

151
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:57,520
establish the zetas as before so these triangles with zeta star and theta are similar express as

152
00:15:57,520 --> 00:16:04,240
follows steps nine and ten chase these ratios to establish similarity of these triangles as before

153
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:11,200
step 11 establish the lambdas as before and step 12 establish this quadrilateral as cyclic

154
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:16,000
and we're done i'm sure we could shorten this further but without much thought i took this

155
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:22,720
from 40 steps to 12 with the benefit of hindsight but my main issue with this proof is that the

156
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:30,480
reason why the result is true doesn't leap out at me a good proof should show why the result holds

157
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:37,440
the logic should enlighten us and i don't find this particularly illuminating however this does

158
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:43,760
veer close to my favorite solution to the problem consider the intersecting second theorem this

159
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:49,440
says that if you have two non-parallel second lines one meeting the circle at a and b and the other

160
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:57,680
at x and y and crossing at p then the following holds ap times bp is equal to xp times yp the

161
00:16:57,680 --> 00:17:05,120
converse is also true if five points have this property then those four points are necessarily

162
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:11,760
cyclic with that in mind once we establish that a o and h are collinear we have by the intersecting

163
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:18,320
second theorem that ab one times ab two is equal to a o times a h and ac one times ac two is equal

164
00:17:18,320 --> 00:17:25,600
to a o times a h thus ab one times ab two equals ac one times ac two and by the converse of the

165
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:32,080
intersecting second theorem these points are cyclic this proof was written by a human and there is a

166
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:38,880
wealth of other succinct and creative proofs out there but most importantly this is a proof that to

167
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:45,600
me finally does the job of telling me why the result is true i can see it right in front of me

168
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:51,040
these seconds always combining at a vertex and therefore giving rise to this specific circle

169
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:57,280
in the middle all who love mathematics love the spark of insight that proofs like this give us

170
00:17:57,280 --> 00:18:02,720
we don't want to just learn the results we want to experience the unique joy of resonating with

171
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:11,280
this kind of logical poetry it's beautiful this isn't but is that a problem after all it got the

172
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:17,360
answer and it did so in this unique way of combining creativity with deduction so let's now take a

173
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:23,360
broader look at what i think alpha geometry means for ai and what it means for mathematics let me

174
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:29,600
just remind you that i am not a computer scientist i am a mathematician first and foremost everything

175
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:35,040
that follows in this video is just like my opinion man let me loop back to something i said at the

176
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:40,960
start of the video the previous ai's learned to play games while this one can solve problems

177
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:46,800
well is alpha geometry really solving problems because it looks like what it's doing is brute

178
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:52,080
forcing its way around the angles and eventually landing on the result but isn't that what problem

179
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:58,800
solving is alpha geometry solutions are pretty haphazard and lacking in any general direction

180
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:06,240
look at this solution for problem three of 2015's imo horrendous but if you try these problems

181
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:12,000
what do your initial attempts look like i think for most of us we just get our hands dirty and

182
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:17,040
work out a bunch of lengths and angles before we have a good idea we might have slightly more

183
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:22,800
direction and intent behind our choices but is our approach radically different to alpha

184
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:29,920
geometries i don't think so and i find this aspect of alpha geometry impressive and fascinating

185
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:36,800
a less impressive aspect of alpha geometry is that plain geometry is easy to codify in terms

186
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:41,840
of strict rules and results i mean it's kind of telling that the oldest recorded axiomatic

187
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:48,080
approach to mathematics is euclid's elements and that begins with plain geometry olympiad problems

188
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:54,080
are kind of like games we know they have an answer we know they are solvable with high school level

189
00:19:54,080 --> 00:20:00,000
results because that's how they are designed for the language model right brain there are only

190
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:05,040
certain things you can try and certain things that you need to try compare this to analytic

191
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:11,280
number theory or algebraic geometry where problems demand ideas that are way out there this is to say

192
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:16,880
that i don't think alpha geometries achievements can be immediately generalized to other fields of

193
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:22,400
study no more than chess computed deep blue could attempt to play go for this reason that

194
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:28,880
i respectfully disagree with some other commentators on this topic subina hossenfelder for example had

195
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:36,240
this to say about alpha geometry it generally highlights ai's growing ability to reason logically

196
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:42,720
discover new knowledge and verify solutions and not only this it can also explain how it arrived

197
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:49,360
as a conclusion such a type of ai system has users that extends beyond geometry not only can this

198
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:55,760
achievement be generalized across various mathematical domains but it will without doubt also come in

199
00:20:55,760 --> 00:21:03,440
handy in other areas where rational thinking and logical deduction is of use like everything high

200
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:10,160
school level plain geometry questions which remember are written to be solvable are comparatively easy

201
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:15,520
and there is currently no evidence to suggest that this technique can be generalized at this present

202
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:20,320
time now i'm not so naive to think that things will be different in the near future especially

203
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:26,640
given the rate of ai progress so maybe soon an ai can tackle something like algebraic geometry

204
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:33,120
but not right now a computer brute-forced chess but it still took 20 years before a computer

205
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:41,360
one at go here alpha geometry is answering geometry questions by well not quite brute force but it's

206
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:46,640
similar and i think that we're still a while away from seeing ai have a go at some of the

207
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:52,320
unsolved problems across mathematics i come to think of it given all the operations alpha geometry

208
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:57,520
can do every second it's still surprising to me that it still can't outperform the best humans

209
00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:03,600
how weird would it have been if ibm announced that its computer deep blue attempted to beat

210
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:10,080
gary kasparov but came second no the victory over the champion was the milestone i'm not

211
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:14,400
taken away from the achievements in this paper i just think our excitement should be tempered

212
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:21,680
a little in my mind this is a small step beyond beating games like go not a radical leap forward

213
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:26,880
it's natural then to ask about the future and whether ai will tackle unsolved problems

214
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:31,520
those of you who have read the paper will know that alpha geometry developed many synthetic

215
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:38,240
theorems results proved from its foundation that help it make inferences it even discovered

216
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:43,840
a new result in this question because its solution doesn't require one of the premises

217
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:48,160
i'd be gubsmacked if the question setters didn't already know about this and just added this

218
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:54,560
constraint to tune the difficulty of the question but is this a sign of ai eventually being used

219
00:22:54,560 --> 00:23:00,400
to solve open questions and is that a good thing well the first thing i foresee is ai assisted

220
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:06,000
proofs these fall into a similar region of computer assisted proofs but there might be a difference

221
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:11,440
computer assists are basically time savers the four color theorem for example required a lot of

222
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:17,600
pen and paper research to break down the number of cases each of which could then be checked by hand

223
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:22,880
but a computer can do it much faster so it's more practical even simulations and data analyses

224
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:27,680
essentially boil down to just doing a lot of calculations which could be done by hand if we

225
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:33,440
had infinite mathematicians writing on infinite blackboards but we do it by computer to save time

226
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:39,440
a computer is just part of the equipment of the modern 21st century mathematician along

227
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:44,720
with chalk and blackboard along with traditional computer assists ai assists might be considered

228
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:50,960
part of our tool set as well but ai might replace some of the creativity involved and so would a

229
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:58,720
purely generated ai proof it feels like cheating but is that a bad thing well we need to ask why

230
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:04,800
do we bother solving hard problems other than to satiate our curiosity i think there are three

231
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:11,680
reasons the first is that they have immediate practical value these are things like optimization

232
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:17,520
problems that could revolutionize aspects of computing or cracking the enigma code it shortened

233
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:24,480
the war direct impact a non-mathematical example would be curing a disease it's just good the

234
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:30,320
benefits are immediate and tangible the second reason is that the theory or techniques we develop

235
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:36,000
in order to solve them could be used elsewhere this is the spin-off effect proving firmars last

236
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:41,280
year and for example required several leaps that connected many areas of mathematics and improved

237
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:46,080
our overall understanding a non-mathematical example might be that we didn't really gain

238
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:52,560
any practical value from armstrong setting foot on the moon but many innovations were required

239
00:24:52,560 --> 00:24:58,480
to get in there which have everyday use thirdly most importantly for me as a pure mathematician

240
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:04,560
and a reason i think is overlooked it's just good to solve problems you know it's the old

241
00:25:04,560 --> 00:25:09,040
why climb Everest because it's there even without the innovations required for the

242
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:14,640
Apollo missions i still find the moon landing endlessly inspiring maybe the proof of the

243
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:20,000
collet's conjecture won't directly impact my life in the slightest but i'll still find the event

244
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:25,520
enormously inspiring nonetheless basically the reason we solve problems and really the reason

245
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:31,280
we do anything is either because it's useful or because it's beautiful or it's neither like my

246
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:38,320
phd thesis but still both reasons are valuable so here's my take on ai in mathematics if a solution

247
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:44,400
to a problem has immediate practical value we should use ai and cheat and get the answer

248
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:50,000
who cares if we look up the answer to a disease cure it'll save lives the second case gets a

249
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:56,720
bit weird though i worry that ai assisted proofs might not develop interesting spin-off theory

250
00:25:56,720 --> 00:26:03,520
and instead force the solution out of pre-existing knowledge when humans puzzle for a long time

251
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:09,840
they force themselves to be creative and that's where the new theory lies ai might get the answer

252
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:16,080
with a messy and haphazard application of more basic stuff so we miss out on potential new techniques

253
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:22,240
this isn't exactly the same but by analogy it's like this geometry problem did you know the

254
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:27,200
intersecting second theorem before you saw this proof you might have done but alpha geometry on

255
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:32,400
the other hand applied the same few results over and over admittedly that's just my opinion i don't

256
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:38,400
really have any direct evidence of this but we are already starting to see stagnation in other areas

257
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:44,720
of ai generated content but my main reservation with ai generated proofs is this third point

258
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:50,080
the beauty i know alpha geometry wasn't designed to create beautiful proofs and again this is just

259
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:56,320
my opinion but i want to convince you why beauty really matters imagine if an artist composed the

260
00:26:56,320 --> 00:27:02,160
greatest painting ever there is likely no practical value to be found in the painting or in any of

261
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:07,520
the techniques developed to compose it but we wouldn't say that it's pointless as an enormous

262
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:14,000
cultural contribution it would still enrich our lives in ways beyond what is practical well

263
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:19,280
mathematics is part of our culture has your life tangibly and practically improved because

264
00:27:19,280 --> 00:27:26,080
wiles proved firmars last theorem probably not but the story likely inspired you the result was

265
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:32,640
as much an enriching cultural contribution as a great piece of art would the story have inspired

266
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:39,840
you if an ai had proved firmars last theorem and this is again where i disagree with sabina i know

267
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:46,800
this last comment was a bit of a joke but rational thinking and logical deduction aren't useful for

268
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:53,680
everything i can't rationally convince you why this proof is beautiful to me it just is and nor

269
00:27:53,680 --> 00:27:59,920
can i convince you why alpha geometries proofs are ugly and does this matter yes because we're in the

270
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:05,120
land of plain geometry which isn't some untapped wilderness of mathematical usefulness it's a

271
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:11,520
playground squarely in the domain of beauty and what makes something beautiful i don't know it

272
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:16,960
isn't the length of the proof as shorter isn't always better and it isn't simplicity as too

273
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:23,040
simple often hides or disguises the inner workings we just know it when we see it and i don't think

274
00:28:23,040 --> 00:28:29,280
ai has come close to capturing beauty yet there's a line about aesthetics in the alpha geometry paper

275
00:28:29,280 --> 00:28:34,400
how alpha geometry might discover some plain geometry results overlooked by us humans because

276
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:39,920
it isn't biased towards symmetry or that which is aesthetically pleasing and great you do you

277
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:45,520
alpha geometry but if it isn't aesthetically pleasing why do we care mathematics is often seen

278
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:51,680
as something that's purely logical it's black and white and we love it for that but we also love

279
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:57,680
it for the aesthetics like be honest if i made a video saying here's an ugly geometrical result

280
00:28:57,680 --> 00:29:03,600
and here are the 100 difficult steps it takes to get there would you care about that no i

281
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:10,000
curate topics that expose mathematical beauty even when the solution is kind of ugly i try to make

282
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:15,200
every step intuitive so we can appreciate the symmetry the hidden magic and the beauty within

283
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:22,800
three blue one browns video on collisions printing pie it's a jaw dropping result but we all watched

284
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:28,640
the whole video because the real or comes not from seeing the answer but from seeing why

285
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:36,640
that's what we love that's what inspires us not this i want to be super clear here i am not

286
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:42,560
criticizing alpha geometry or the authors of this paper alpha geometry wasn't designed to

287
00:29:42,560 --> 00:29:47,040
create beautiful mathematics it was designed to solve olympiad problems and it does that pretty

288
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:53,840
all i'm saying is that while ai might be close to solving problems i think it's far from solving

289
00:29:53,840 --> 00:30:00,560
problems beautifully this is where my concerns lie and why i'm not yet excited about ai generated

290
00:30:00,560 --> 00:30:06,800
proofs to me mathematics is the most creative and beautiful thing there is my qualms echo those

291
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:12,960
who love visual art music and film and fear that artists musicians writers and actors will be replaced

292
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:21,280
by ai this replacement will be a cultural net negative if ai also solves our mathematical problems

293
00:30:21,280 --> 00:30:27,600
we might sacrifice their cultural impact as well thank you so much for watching a bit of a different

294
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:33,440
video this time because i wanted to respond to the news i think alpha geometry is a fascinating new

295
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:39,760
approach but the more i thought about it the more i felt i needed to say so i hope you enjoyed and

296
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:44,240
if you disagree with my take that's absolutely fine let me know down in the comments and keep the

298
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:54,400
like to support me you'll get your name in the credits access to extended cuts of select videos

299
00:30:54,400 --> 00:31:00,000
we get to hang out on our dedicated discord community and more if not don't worry subscribe

300
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:04,320
and share the video that will help me out as well this has been a human made proof under

301
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:18,240
another roof until next time
