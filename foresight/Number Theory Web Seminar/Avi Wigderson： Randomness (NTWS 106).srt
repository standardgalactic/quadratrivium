1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,120
When the organizers asked me to give a talk in this seminar,

2
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:10,160
I told them that I have no new results or maybe no old results

3
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:12,280
even in number theory.

4
00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:19,120
And I can talk about some general topics

5
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:21,840
in my field of interest in complexity theory.

6
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:24,400
And they said that it could be great or good.

7
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:30,280
So I'll talk about randomness, which is one of my favorite topics.

8
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:36,000
I want to talk about this randomness.

9
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,360
It's something that I guess mankind was always interested in.

10
00:00:40,360 --> 00:00:44,720
And it's a topic you can talk to almost everyone on the street

11
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:53,640
about lack and chance and unpredictability and informally.

12
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:56,680
But you can, you know, mathematicians study the randomness

13
00:00:56,680 --> 00:01:03,400
in variety of forms in probability and statistics and so on.

14
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:10,320
And then physicists are extremely curious about randomness

15
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:14,640
and the meaning of randomness and a lot of scientific interest

16
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:15,640
in randomness.

17
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:17,880
So it's a very, very broad topic.

18
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:23,840
And people have sometimes very strong opinions about randomness

19
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:24,920
and its meaning and so on.

20
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:28,720
So what I want to tell you about today is this computational

21
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:32,680
complexity point of view of randomness.

22
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:38,280
And of course, this is a very general, high-level, non-technical talk.

23
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:42,640
It will be a lot of things you'll see you would have known.

24
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:50,080
So I would like to stress it's a new conceptual element.

25
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:52,800
So there'll be lots of examples.

26
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:59,520
And I'll tell you when something new is coming of importance.

27
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:03,200
OK, so what's now is OK.

28
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:08,320
The plan is, first of all, I'm going

29
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:12,240
to talk only about discrete events.

30
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:16,400
For number theory, this is usually OK.

31
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:18,240
So what's perfect randomness for me?

32
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:24,160
Perfect that the perfect random event will be a coin toss.

33
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:28,840
Something that has probability of heads and tails equal to half.

34
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:31,600
And if there are many of them, they are independent.

35
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:33,480
So I always show this slide.

36
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:37,640
Which of these two sequences of 20 letters is more probable?

37
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:39,320
I know you know the answer.

38
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:40,480
They're equally probable.

39
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:44,760
So that is what we would call the uniform distribution

40
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:46,560
or the distribution with full entropy.

41
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:50,080
This would be like an ideal model of randomness.

42
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:52,000
Perfect randomness.

43
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,520
And for the first 15 minutes or so,

44
00:02:56,520 --> 00:03:03,000
I'll just go through examples of different applications,

45
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:07,360
you can call them, or ways in which randomness is used.

46
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:08,600
Places it is used.

47
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:12,480
And the main thing in the back of our mind

48
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:16,200
should be, can we really do that?

49
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:20,880
I mean, what do we do if we don't have perfect independence?

50
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:23,880
Can any of them be done without it?

51
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:26,320
And in order to understand this, we'll

52
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:32,520
move to define pseudo randomness, which roughly speaking,

53
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:36,440
is just a, you can think of collectively deterministic

54
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:40,280
structures that share some properties with random ones.

55
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:41,240
Some properties.

56
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:44,200
And we'll talk about different such properties.

57
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:47,120
And that will help us understand that.

58
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:49,080
We'll see many examples.

59
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:55,240
And then I will go back to the basic question of what

60
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:58,960
can we do in a world in which there is no perfect randomness?

61
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:01,200
Maybe there is weak randomness or no randomness

62
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:03,680
and we'll roughly discuss the meaning of this.

63
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:07,000
All pretty informal.

64
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:11,240
Of course, underlying the main messages

65
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:14,600
are formal theorems that move them that you

66
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:16,400
can quiz me about that.

67
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:23,000
OK, so let me start with the utility of randomness.

68
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,880
And as I said, the back of our mind,

69
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:29,040
you'll see this icon in every slide.

70
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:32,520
You can ask yourself, or maybe you have asked yourself,

71
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:35,520
where are the random bits for this coming from?

72
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:38,480
And we'll discuss that later.

73
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:41,440
OK, so the most basic example that everybody

74
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:44,960
gives to the power of randomness is just sampling.

75
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:50,080
You want to know what will be the fraction of people

76
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:53,080
who will vote red in a particular country.

77
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:57,640
You just, even if it's huge, it's millions of people.

78
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:01,600
If you sample 2,000 at random, but completely at random,

79
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:05,040
a perfect subset of 2,000 at random,

80
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:09,000
then you know that with probability at least 99%

81
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:13,120
over this choice, the percentage of red votes

82
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:15,600
in the sample and the red votes in the population

83
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:20,560
will be within 2% of the actual percentage.

84
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:25,360
And we know it's hugely powerful.

85
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:33,240
First of all, we know that these numbers, 2 and 1%,

86
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:35,640
don't depend on the size of the population.

87
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:38,280
That's basically the law of large numbers.

88
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:41,600
It's a very powerful way of using randomness.

89
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:44,360
And of course, the main point is that if we didn't have

90
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:48,840
randomness here, it's not clear how we would get even an estimate

91
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:54,640
up to 2% without asking 98% of the population what they think.

92
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:57,120
So that's a very, very strong demonstration.

93
00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:00,120
And I want to move to less obvious ones.

94
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:05,120
Here's one.

95
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:10,480
I give you this portion of the plane,

96
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:12,120
the proportion of the grid.

97
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:17,880
And I ask you, in how many ways can you tie this with dominoes?

98
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:20,040
You don't have to look at the colors here.

99
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:23,600
Just in how many ways can you tie this region with dominoes?

100
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:25,360
It can be this rectangular region.

101
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:28,640
It could be any other region.

102
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:34,120
And this is a basic question, a basic counting question.

103
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:37,680
Of course, it doesn't come out of nowhere.

104
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:40,360
I mean, it's picturesque, but it's also important.

105
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:43,200
It's got a dimer problem in physics.

106
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:47,040
And for diatomic molecules, it captures

107
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:52,000
thermodynamic properties of that matter.

108
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:55,360
You can understand from it free energy, phase transitions,

109
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:56,800
and stuff like that.

110
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:58,960
So it's also an important problem.

111
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:02,840
But the main problem is that there can be,

112
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:04,240
even the region is small.

113
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:05,760
It's 1,000 by 1,000.

114
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:10,680
The number of such configurations can be used.

115
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:13,960
And here's a very important result

116
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:17,440
from about 20 years ago, Jerome Cichlial Vigoda.

117
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:21,520
They found a way to approximately count

118
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:24,760
the number of dominoes tiling in any region.

119
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:26,040
In fact, it's more general.

120
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:30,280
It's the number of matchings in any graph.

121
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:33,200
Doesn't have to be planar.

122
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:36,480
The type of algorithm, I'm not going to describe algorithm,

123
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:38,720
but the nature of it is some people know.

124
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:41,360
It's what's called the Monte Carlo method.

125
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:44,760
The number of matchings can be exponential

126
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:48,040
in the size of the region, so the size of the graph.

127
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:52,280
So you cannot just write it down or look at all of them.

128
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:56,080
There's a sort of Markov chain analyzing this.

129
00:07:56,080 --> 00:08:02,040
And anyway, figuring out that this Markov chain converges

130
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:04,040
quickly is highly non-trivial.

131
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:07,640
And that gives a probabilistic algorithm

132
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:11,080
for this problem for approximately counting the number.

133
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:13,760
We know that counting exactly the number

134
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:16,320
is a difficult problem, and I will not go into this.

135
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:20,840
So this approximation problem can be done fast probabilistically.

136
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:24,960
But the best deterministic algorithm known

137
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:26,920
requires exponential timing.

138
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:30,040
We can do really better than just trying all possibilities

139
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:32,240
and adding them up.

140
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:36,760
So I want to stress that this is the best known deterministic

141
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:37,280
algorithm.

142
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:39,920
There may be faster ones that we haven't discovered yet,

143
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:43,120
and actually we'll see at the end that maybe there

144
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:45,440
is the faster one.

145
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:48,920
OK, so there are many, many such examples.

146
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:50,640
And this is really the key application

147
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:53,040
that I want to eventually discuss.

148
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:55,440
What can we do of randomness, namely

149
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:57,840
to probabilistic algorithm, understanding

150
00:08:57,840 --> 00:09:01,480
the power of randomness in computation.

151
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Many examples, many of them, they are all over mathematics

152
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,320
in every field of mathematics.

153
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:16,120
In number theory, the problem of finding large primes,

154
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:20,200
just give me a thousand big primes, thousand digits prime.

155
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:23,200
We don't know any deterministic way to do that.

156
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:26,560
We can certify primality quickly by now,

157
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:32,360
but we don't know how to just find a large number, which

158
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:35,280
is prime deterministically.

159
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:40,200
Factoring multivariate polynomials over finite fields,

160
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:42,960
it's another example approximating

161
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:48,200
the volume of convex sets in high dimensions,

162
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:50,760
computing large free eco-efficient of multivariate

163
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:54,840
functions that are given by a program, say, that circuit.

164
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:57,840
In all of these things, in all these cases,

165
00:09:57,840 --> 00:09:59,840
and there are many more examples,

166
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:02,440
there are fast probabilistic algorithms,

167
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:06,240
in many cases, that are highly non-trivial.

168
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:10,040
And on the other hand, the best known deterministic

169
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:15,000
algorithm for each of them requires exponential time.

170
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:18,840
So we'd like to know whether there are deterministic ones

171
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:19,520
or not.

172
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:21,120
Sorry, Avi, can I ask?

173
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:23,760
For finding a large prime, why don't you just start?

174
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:26,560
If you want to find a prime above n, you start at n,

175
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:30,000
and then you use, we know the prime is in p.

176
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,200
So you check if n is a prime, then check of n plus 1

177
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:33,760
is a prime, and by the prime number theorem,

178
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:36,760
you take your log n steps before you find one.

179
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:41,360
If you believe the prime, no, no, it will not take your log n.

180
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:46,960
I mean, the best we know is root n or something like that.

181
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:48,560
We don't know that there is a prime.

182
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:49,560
You need cramming.

183
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:51,520
Prime number theorem does not guarantee

184
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:54,520
that every interval of log n is a prime.

185
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:56,360
I mean, the gaps between the primes.

186
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:58,640
OK, so that part of it is still probabilistic,

187
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:00,400
even if I can check the numbers.

188
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:01,600
Yeah, yeah, we don't know.

189
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:04,000
I mean, any advance on any of the expressions

190
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,400
would be extremely interesting.

191
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:13,280
Yeah, I mean, there was a large project in this,

192
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:15,400
I forgot what the last one was.

193
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:17,680
Polymath.

194
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:18,520
Sorry?

195
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:19,960
Polymath.

196
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:24,240
Yeah, polymath, the projects that Tim Giles and Terry Tao

197
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:27,680
organized some 10 years ago just focused

198
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:30,840
on this particular problem, finding large primes.

199
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:33,920
And yeah, this was one of the polymath's failures.

200
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:35,800
I mean, I think it was really interesting

201
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:36,600
what went on there.

202
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:42,680
But anyway, yeah, but it's good to just stress that when

203
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:47,080
we say n, large n, we mean like 1,000 digits.

204
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:50,600
So our number, we start with 1 and then

205
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:54,920
have some 1,000 digits after it, and it's prime.

206
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:57,960
Find one deterministically.

207
00:11:57,960 --> 00:11:58,480
Yeah.

208
00:11:58,480 --> 00:11:59,840
I'll just interrupt for a second.

209
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:02,760
I mean, in practice, you can find large primes very quickly

210
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:05,080
because we know that you don't have

211
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:06,520
to go very far to find a prime.

212
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:08,840
It's the question.

213
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:10,000
There's no practice here.

214
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,360
I want a theorem.

215
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:14,080
I want a theorem.

216
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:14,560
Yeah.

217
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:17,040
No, Joe, but just along Alex's side.

218
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:19,680
Yeah, there are lots of heuristics for lots of problems.

219
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:24,840
And yeah, but anyway, these are just examples.

220
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:29,960
It's just no surprise that you are interested in this one.

221
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:33,480
But I think it's a good challenge for number theory.

222
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:34,960
It's a really interesting one.

223
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:38,240
Of course, we have an algorithm that

224
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:42,800
is deterministic that is conjectured to work very rapidly,

225
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:44,240
but we cannot prove that.

226
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:46,000
Yeah, but this is the only question.

227
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,440
I want something provable.

228
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:49,040
I want a theorem.

229
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:51,800
So in all these cases, the probabilistic algorithm

230
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:55,760
will guarantee to find with the antenna probability of prime

231
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:57,080
and it will certify that.

232
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:58,920
And we want to do it without randomness.

233
00:12:58,920 --> 00:12:59,800
Can we do it?

234
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:02,480
And let's stop the discussion of this.

235
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:03,680
Sorry, I made progress.

236
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:09,440
But yeah, it's a great problem, this particular one.

237
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:10,240
OK, good.

238
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:12,680
So these are examples of probabilistic algorithms.

239
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:15,280
I want to give you examples of just some other things

240
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:23,040
where randomness is used of a different nature, several such

241
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:25,760
examples.

242
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:28,760
Distributed computation, randomness

243
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:33,240
can make not just an exponential improvement in time,

244
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:36,200
but an infinite one, in that they

245
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:39,920
can make some problems that are provably impossible,

246
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:42,000
become possible with randomness.

247
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,800
These are two picturesque examples

248
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:47,760
of fundamental problems in distributed computing.

249
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:49,920
One is the dining philosophers problem.

250
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:52,320
The second is the Byzantine generals problem.

251
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:54,080
As you can tell, these guys know how

252
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:58,560
to pick names for their problems.

253
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:01,640
So in both cases, I will not explain this.

254
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:06,200
It's a bit beside the main course of the lecture,

255
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:09,320
but I want to stress that these are fundamental problems

256
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:12,720
in distributed computation, in asynchronous distributed

257
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:14,320
computation.

258
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:18,040
One is about consensus and one is about coordination.

259
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:23,200
And theorems that there is no deterministic solution,

260
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:25,600
whatever that means, I didn't define it.

261
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:29,080
But if the actors in this distributed system

262
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:33,280
have randomness, then it's possible to solve them.

263
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:37,560
And in fact, these algorithms are used.

264
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:41,440
So here, the gap can be arbitrary between randomness

265
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:42,480
and determinism.

266
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:43,840
And that's provable.

267
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:46,960
So we will not talk about the applications here,

268
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:51,600
but another demonstration.

269
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:58,880
Here's another one that goes even beyond the randomness

270
00:14:58,880 --> 00:14:59,920
helps to do things.

271
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:01,680
It also helps to define things.

272
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:07,640
In game theory, which is supposed

273
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:09,720
to model rational behavior, we try

274
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:11,880
to understand in strategic situation

275
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:15,640
what would actors, players, agents do.

276
00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:21,120
Here's a very simple example from a game of Auman called

277
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:28,680
the chicken game, which is often done in game theory,

278
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:32,760
represented by a matrix of payoffs for two players.

279
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:37,000
In this, you can imagine that this game represents

280
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:41,240
two sort of macho drivers driving towards each other

281
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:42,240
on a narrow road.

282
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:44,720
And they can either, each of them

283
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:50,840
can either sway to the side or continue to drive.

284
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:53,920
And like being cautious or aggressive.

285
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:57,000
And the payoffs to each of them are written here,

286
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,520
where you can see in the bottom right

287
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:00,920
that if they are both aggressive,

288
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:03,520
then no one deviates.

289
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:05,400
They both basically die.

290
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:14,200
But anyway, you ask what would players do in such a situation?

291
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:15,880
What would be a rational behavior?

292
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:19,320
And as I'm sure most of you know,

293
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:23,960
there is a key concept that John Nash defined,

294
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:25,680
the Nash equilibrium.

295
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:30,840
You want a strategy for each pair of strategies,

296
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:35,480
such that given the other one, you would not change yours.

297
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:38,120
So it's kind of a stability requirement

298
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:43,360
on a solution concept.

299
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:46,880
And it's a very natural one to choose.

300
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:52,160
And of course, Nash didn't get the Nobel Prize just

301
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:53,720
for the definition.

302
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:56,880
He also had a theorem, is that every game,

303
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:59,200
every strategic game of this nature,

304
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:03,240
no matter how many players, no matter how many strategies,

305
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:05,680
there is always such a solution.

306
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:07,640
This solution concept is universal.

307
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:10,400
It always exists.

308
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:13,080
What is interesting and important for us

309
00:17:13,080 --> 00:17:16,440
is that, again, as many of you know,

310
00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:21,040
this depends on the ability of players to toss coins.

311
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:23,520
So the strategies they will choose,

312
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:26,840
the strategies that exist are mixed strategies,

313
00:17:26,840 --> 00:17:28,920
namely the random strategies.

314
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:35,880
In this particular game, there's a unique such equilibrium.

315
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:38,040
With these numbers, it happens to me

316
00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:40,720
to be cautious with probability 3 quarter

317
00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:43,280
and aggressive with probability 1 quarter.

318
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:46,560
If you know that the other driver behaves like this,

319
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:50,600
you would stay with your choice.

320
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:56,200
Anyway, the main point here is that if you require

321
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:57,960
or you don't allow them randomness,

322
00:17:57,960 --> 00:18:02,680
if they are deterministic, there's no equilibrium.

323
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:07,520
So here's another place where there are several points here.

324
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:09,920
This is something that exists with randomness

325
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:12,440
and does not exist without randomness.

326
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:19,920
Another is that you can ask yourself, here, it's really important.

327
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:22,960
I mean, are people in life, in economic situations,

328
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:24,680
speaking strategies like this?

329
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:27,160
And are they using randomness and so on?

330
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:30,960
Anyway, but that's just another example.

331
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:34,840
Example closer to computer science

332
00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:38,920
and to life of everybody is cryptography,

333
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:45,400
where randomness is basically you can't live home without it.

334
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:48,240
Everything depends on it.

335
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:51,360
The very definition of a secret needs randomness.

336
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:54,000
I mean, if you Shannon already pointed out

337
00:18:54,000 --> 00:19:00,600
that formalized using this notion of entropy and so on,

338
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:03,600
a secret is basically as good as entropy in it.

339
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:07,880
I mean, if you pick your 90s password randomly,

340
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:13,360
then my chances of guessing it is exactly 10 to the 9.

341
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:17,960
If, on the other hand, you pick it as the phone number of one

342
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:22,200
of your friends, then I probably have a better chance of guessing it.

343
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:26,280
It will have much less sense of it.

344
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:29,000
But then, of course, randomness is absolutely essential

345
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:37,600
to any notion we define in cryptography, basically everything.

346
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:43,840
And also there, and this is something that's practically used all the time,

347
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:47,840
you can ask yourself what randomness is used there

348
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:52,400
and is it perfect as the definitions all assume,

349
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:57,920
perfect randomness like the public scargoite, all assume perfect randomness.

350
00:19:57,920 --> 00:19:59,760
Where is it coming from?

351
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:02,800
Yeah, randomness is used in lots of other places, of course.

352
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:06,120
And also there you may want the random bits

353
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:10,200
coming from in the casino and so on.

354
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:13,680
So that's about the set of examples I wanted to talk about.

355
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:20,760
And it's clear that randomness is an essential part of lots of our lives.

356
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:25,360
So now I want to ask the question we asked before.

357
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:27,320
Where are these random bits coming from?

358
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:30,800
Let's say in particular applications that we have seen.

359
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:35,680
And I don't know about you, but when I don't know the answer

360
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:40,760
to a question I asked Google, I'm sure you do many times.

361
00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:45,160
So you feed Google through random bits.

362
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:45,880
What do you get?

363
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:51,560
Well, 10 years ago when this slide is from, I got four million answers.

364
00:20:51,560 --> 00:20:55,640
Probably today there will be 400 million answers.

365
00:20:55,640 --> 00:21:04,520
But you start at the answer more or less is basically you buy them.

366
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:06,840
You want good random bits, you buy them.

367
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:11,120
At least there are lots of companies that will sell you random bits.

368
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:15,360
And then you can ask yourself, well, where do they take their random bits from?

369
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:19,240
And OK, well, you can read what they say.

370
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:27,520
I mean, some take it from various physical phenomena, which is interesting

371
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:30,440
because they seem somewhat unpredictable.

372
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:35,160
Some take them from other physical phenomena, which are maybe more unpredictable,

373
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:38,280
like quantum behavior.

374
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:43,760
If you wonder about casinos at least some years ago, they were all using this chip

375
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:46,640
of this company and you can wonder whether it works or not.

376
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:52,040
I mean, whether what they are doing does generate random bits or random in what sense.

377
00:21:52,040 --> 00:21:54,320
Anyway, we would like to understand this question.

378
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:56,480
What is randomness?

379
00:21:56,480 --> 00:22:04,320
In fact, what is randomness to any particular purpose that randomness is good?

380
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:12,360
And so now I really want to come to a central definition.

381
00:22:12,360 --> 00:22:22,800
And yeah, this time to the next slide is maybe the most important slide of the talk.

382
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:27,240
We are trying to define or understand how to define the randomness.

383
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:33,360
So it's taken from a fundamental paper of Blame and Michali from the early 80s.

384
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:39,760
And here I invite Alina to unmute herself and join me.

385
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:43,480
It's OK, Alina.

386
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:45,640
Alina, are you there?

387
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:46,880
Yes, I'm here.

388
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:48,320
All right, yes.

389
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:51,920
Enthusiastic, as I can see.

390
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:58,200
OK, so yeah, I'm going to do an experiment.

391
00:22:58,200 --> 00:22:59,240
We are trying to understand.

392
00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:06,960
We said that the post-typical random event is a coin toss, half tails, half heads.

393
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:12,760
So suppose I'm holding a coin and I'm going to toss it in the air.

394
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:25,800
I'll toss a coin and, you know, you should guess just as it leaves my finger.

395
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:35,040
So maybe we assume we are in the same room, let's say, as in the picture you are watching me.

396
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:40,520
And, you know, maybe it spends two seconds in the air and you should guess just as it

397
00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:45,560
leaves my finger whether it will be heads on tails when it lands on the floor.

398
00:23:45,560 --> 00:23:52,280
OK, what do you think the probability that you'll predict it correctly will be?

399
00:23:52,280 --> 00:23:53,960
Uh-huh.

400
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:55,040
Good.

401
00:23:55,040 --> 00:23:58,520
I told you not to worry.

402
00:23:58,520 --> 00:24:02,440
Good, OK, so I agree and I think most people will give this answer.

403
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:05,640
OK, OK, let me ask you another question.

404
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:09,640
Suppose, you know, you are holding a laptop.

405
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:13,360
In fact, I know you have a laptop that you are watching.

406
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:14,280
You can use it.

407
00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:22,200
So, you know, as I currently my finger, you know, you can do whatever you want.

408
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:27,840
What do you think is the probability that you will predict it correctly?

409
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:29,560
Still, huh?

410
00:24:29,560 --> 00:24:32,200
OK, we are in agreement.

411
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:36,280
And again, I think everybody will have the same view.

412
00:24:36,280 --> 00:24:39,600
OK, and so now let's change it again.

413
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:49,720
And suppose I give you, you know, any number of video cameras that are trained on my fingers

414
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:55,480
and they are all connected to a great computer and a supercomputer and it is connected to

415
00:24:55,480 --> 00:25:01,920
your laptop and they are all ready to go just as I toss the coin.

416
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:08,440
What do you think will be the chances that you predict the outcome correctly?

417
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:10,720
Well, depends how well positioned.

418
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:13,040
It is powerful as you want.

419
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:16,480
It gets, I guess, closer to one, right?

420
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:21,360
Yeah, well, I think the right person.

421
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:23,040
Thank you.

422
00:25:23,040 --> 00:25:26,000
Yeah, so what's the point about this?

423
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:34,880
Again, I think that you can imagine that, you know, with sufficient machinery, one can

424
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:41,720
calculate, you know, the angular momentum of the coin and the, you know, the air pressure

425
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:47,240
and the humidity in the air and the distance to the floor with perfect accuracy so that

426
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:52,680
almost surely you'll get the right answer suddenly in far less than two seconds.

427
00:25:52,680 --> 00:25:55,400
OK, so what is the point of this?

428
00:25:55,400 --> 00:26:02,120
There is a major point which deviates from all previous views of randomness.

429
00:26:02,120 --> 00:26:13,480
I want to stress that the experiment, me tossing the coin, the random event, suppose the random

430
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:17,080
event, the event anyway we are using, didn't change.

431
00:26:17,080 --> 00:26:18,600
My behavior didn't change here.

432
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:19,600
I'm tossing the coin.

433
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:21,640
I'm the random generator.

434
00:26:21,640 --> 00:26:23,480
I didn't change at all.

435
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:24,480
Right?

436
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:25,480
This is the point.

437
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:33,200
So what is happening is we are seeing a property of randomness that distinguishes between different

438
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:37,880
observers of the random phenomena, right?

439
00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:43,600
Depends, you know, randomness somehow, I mean, the ability to predict how much entropy is

440
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:50,240
in the coin depends on the, maybe not the eye of the beholder, but the computational

441
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:53,640
power of the beholder, OK?

442
00:26:53,640 --> 00:27:03,960
So this is very different than basically every prior point of view till the 80s.

443
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:13,040
It's an objective definition, sorry, unlike the previous objective definition of randomness.

444
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:14,240
This is a subjective one.

445
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:21,760
It depends on the observer and its operative, you know, we look at what the observer would

446
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:27,200
say or what's the probability that the observer will say something about what they see.

447
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:34,280
OK, so we are going to take now this, you know, point of view and going to study pseudo

448
00:27:34,280 --> 00:27:38,880
randomness or notions, various notions of pseudo randomness because they too will depend

449
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:44,600
on observers or on properties of events that are being looked at.

450
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:50,160
So I'm switching now to the second part and if there's an important question or somebody

451
00:27:50,160 --> 00:28:02,200
in the chat that Philip saw that is, you know, I need to answer now, I'm happy to.

452
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:11,360
So just repeat the message is that we are now considering randomness as a property of

453
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:12,360
the observer.

454
00:28:12,360 --> 00:28:18,400
How much randomness, how much entropy or what is, what is, what we recall random depends

455
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:21,920
on observers or on properties of what we are seeing.

456
00:28:21,920 --> 00:28:25,240
OK, so let me just start giving examples.

457
00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:33,640
So now I'm moving to the second part and this is about pseudo randomness and this slide

458
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:36,920
is a bit abstract and then there will be many examples.

459
00:28:36,920 --> 00:28:42,200
So don't worry if this is a bit abstract, but anyway, it should be appealing still.

460
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:45,360
We are looking now at deterministic structure.

461
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:51,320
So imagine that the universe of objects, these objects can be, you know, of any types

462
00:28:51,320 --> 00:28:59,360
that can be numbers, graphs, sequences, tables, works, codes, lots of possibilities, but

463
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:02,120
discrete ones.

464
00:29:02,120 --> 00:29:12,080
And in it, we want to understand what is the random like behavior or a typical behavior

465
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:17,320
and it will, I'll call it a property and the property will be just a subset of this

466
00:29:17,320 --> 00:29:21,360
universe and the definition will be really simple.

467
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:27,600
A pseudo random property is any large property, any property, any subset that occupies most

468
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:28,840
of the universe.

469
00:29:28,840 --> 00:29:40,200
So think of a hay in a, you know, in a haystack.

470
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:52,800
So a property that's held by most elements of the universe, equivalently, it's like

471
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:58,840
the hay in a haystack or, you know, another way to think about it is you should pick a

472
00:29:58,840 --> 00:30:02,720
random element from you, it satisfies this property.

473
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:06,680
So this I will call and for the, you know, this example that will follow this will be

474
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:12,040
for me a pseudo random property.

475
00:30:12,040 --> 00:30:16,720
I want to stress that both math and CS have lots of questions about pseudo randomness

476
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:18,320
and we'll see them.

477
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:25,480
The typical task, such question in mathematics is whether a particular object has a pseudo

478
00:30:25,480 --> 00:30:29,920
random property, which is defined.

479
00:30:29,920 --> 00:30:35,120
So we study, you know, there's random like properties of natural, this X zero, maybe

480
00:30:35,160 --> 00:30:40,080
natural, we'll see examples in computer science is a different angle.

481
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:50,240
Mostly we look, you know, we want an algorithm to find any element of this with this property.

482
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:56,200
So basically we are looking for finding objects that have random like properties.

483
00:30:56,200 --> 00:30:58,360
We know that most of them are like that.

484
00:30:58,360 --> 00:31:04,080
So it's like sort of searching for hay in a haystack and, you know, as we'll see, I

485
00:31:04,120 --> 00:31:06,600
mean, this is not an easy task.

486
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:10,960
Despite, you know, the popular culture, we are not looking for needles.

487
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:13,640
We are looking for hay.

488
00:31:13,640 --> 00:31:20,640
OK, so let's see examples and, you know, we'll get familiar to my terminology here.

489
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:27,080
First, I want to say just why, you know, yeah, the popular culture does say that we

490
00:31:27,080 --> 00:31:29,160
should easily find hay in haystack.

491
00:31:29,160 --> 00:31:33,520
Why, why is this not true in the in the problems we are really interested in?

492
00:31:33,520 --> 00:31:38,120
First of all, that, you know, we are talking about huge objects.

493
00:31:38,120 --> 00:31:43,000
And typically we see very, very tiny parts of them.

494
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:47,520
So we may see closer to us, maybe needles.

495
00:31:47,520 --> 00:31:53,160
And we also often tend to search, you know, sort of using the tools we have, but they

496
00:31:53,160 --> 00:31:54,160
may not be sufficient.

497
00:31:54,160 --> 00:31:57,400
I just want to give two sort of popular examples.

498
00:31:57,400 --> 00:32:05,520
You know, we may look at this and say, oh, this is green everywhere, even though we know

499
00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:08,880
most of it is red, but we have to cut it first.

500
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:15,080
And another example is that I like a lot is this issue of exoplanets.

501
00:32:15,080 --> 00:32:21,560
I mean, for up to about 30 years ago, 25 years ago, I think people had no evidence

502
00:32:21,560 --> 00:32:29,080
that other stars, which are, of course, suns in the universe have any planets.

503
00:32:29,080 --> 00:32:30,360
There was no way to see them.

504
00:32:30,360 --> 00:32:33,040
You need the particular new techniques.

505
00:32:33,040 --> 00:32:38,800
So you could have predicted that, you know, no, no suns have planets, except maybe ours.

506
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:40,800
But it's not true.

507
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:41,800
Okay.

508
00:32:41,800 --> 00:32:46,560
So sometimes, you know, we don't, we don't, these are huge objects and we may not have

509
00:32:46,560 --> 00:32:47,560
the right tools.

510
00:32:47,560 --> 00:32:51,560
So let's see, you know, more mathematical example.

511
00:32:51,560 --> 00:32:56,560
Let me start with codes, because most people are familiar with them.

512
00:32:56,560 --> 00:33:01,200
Of course, codes are extremely, air-correcting codes are extremely important to, you know,

513
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:07,120
lots of things we use in our daily lives and embedded in all of the storage and communication

514
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:13,920
devices are good air-correcting codes that they have, you know, large rates and distance

515
00:33:13,920 --> 00:33:14,920
if you want.

516
00:33:14,920 --> 00:33:20,000
You know, there's a formal definition of what a good code, what the properties of a good

517
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:21,000
code is.

518
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:27,280
But, you know, let's fix some such notion.

519
00:33:27,280 --> 00:33:35,560
The basic result that Shannon, you know, opened the door for this amazing theory, coding theory,

520
00:33:35,560 --> 00:33:42,400
was the, first of all, the observation that a random code is a good code.

521
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:44,160
Almost all codes are good codes.

522
00:33:44,160 --> 00:33:50,160
I'm not defining formally the space and so on, but some of you know and some of you

523
00:33:50,160 --> 00:33:51,160
can imagine.

524
00:33:51,160 --> 00:33:54,400
But regardless, a random code is a good code.

525
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:59,120
And the first thing I want to take from this is to, you know, instill in you that, you

526
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:05,600
know, my notation, this, that means that good codes is a, being a good code is a pseudo

527
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:06,600
random property.

528
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:07,600
Why?

529
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:10,160
Because it's, you know, almost every code is good.

530
00:34:10,160 --> 00:34:11,160
Okay.

531
00:34:11,160 --> 00:34:12,480
That's one point.

532
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:13,680
And then what do you want to do?

533
00:34:13,680 --> 00:34:17,800
If you want to put it in various devices, you need to be also useful.

534
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:23,560
You want to be able to describe it, decode and code it, decode it and so on.

535
00:34:23,560 --> 00:34:24,800
And this is a hard problem.

536
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:29,800
I mean, that took, you know, some 20 years, then we are still looking for other, you know,

537
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:36,000
even better ones, but to find explicit codes, you know, efficiently usable codes, this,

538
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:37,480
this is a hard problem.

539
00:34:37,480 --> 00:34:45,480
So this is an example of problem, you know, of finding an element of a pseudo random property.

540
00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:51,640
Here's a very different element, a very different example, I'm sure you're all familiar with

541
00:34:51,640 --> 00:34:54,800
this number.

542
00:34:54,800 --> 00:35:04,040
So here is a, you know, a property that you would like maybe this random to satisfy or

543
00:35:04,040 --> 00:35:06,760
is believed to be a property of pi.

544
00:35:06,760 --> 00:35:12,960
If you look at the number of occurrences of the digits seven in the expansion of pi,

545
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:17,240
it looks like it appears about one tenth of the time.

546
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:23,640
If you look at any pair of digits, let's say five, four point 65, four occurs one hundredth

547
00:35:23,640 --> 00:35:25,360
of the time.

548
00:35:25,360 --> 00:35:28,560
If you look at any triple one thousandths of the time, et cetera.

549
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:35,200
So let's demand that let's say we are looking at real numbers, maybe between zero and one.

550
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:41,120
And we want all these properties, it's a countable number of properties, we want them

551
00:35:41,120 --> 00:35:43,480
to hold about this real number.

552
00:35:43,480 --> 00:35:49,160
And moreover, we want them to hold not only in base them, but in base seven, in base 15,

553
00:35:49,160 --> 00:35:56,560
in base million and one and so on, still a countable countable number of properties.

554
00:35:56,560 --> 00:36:04,120
And what do we know about this, these are called normal numbers, properties, number satisfying

555
00:36:04,120 --> 00:36:12,040
all these properties are called normal and basically an observation that just because

556
00:36:12,040 --> 00:36:16,760
are only countable in many conditions that the random real number, let's say between

557
00:36:16,760 --> 00:36:25,680
real and between zero and one is normal with high probability except with probability zero.

558
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:32,840
So again, this means that normality is a pseudo random property, it is held by almost

559
00:36:32,840 --> 00:36:36,880
every number in the universe repeat.

560
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:43,160
And mathematicians study this question is, you know, for example, particular natural

561
00:36:43,160 --> 00:36:48,040
elements like pi like root two or whatever are normal.

562
00:36:48,040 --> 00:36:53,040
And I should say this is, these problems are still open, maybe some of you are working

563
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:55,960
on them, I don't know.

564
00:36:55,960 --> 00:37:02,080
Yeah, anyway, so the open problems in the, you know, that are formulated naturally formulated

565
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:08,120
in this language of randomness, give me, give me an object that looks like a random object

566
00:37:08,120 --> 00:37:12,960
here in the pseudo random properties normality.

567
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:21,760
So this may be, you know, not a central examples in mathematics, but I want to say that the

568
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:27,000
problems that can be expressed in exactly this form, you know, is a natural object pseudo

569
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:31,640
random are absolutely fundamental in both math and computer science.

570
00:37:31,640 --> 00:37:39,720
And I want to give you another example with you, you particularly will know number theories.

571
00:37:39,720 --> 00:37:49,960
But in general, the major problems that concern or can be phrased questions about pseudo randomness.

572
00:37:50,920 --> 00:37:58,120
Usually, if I have a room, talking to and can see people like us, young ones, you know,

573
00:37:58,120 --> 00:38:00,120
what are major problems?

574
00:38:00,120 --> 00:38:03,960
How do you know that the problem is major?

575
00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:11,240
Well, one, one answer is that there's a lot of bounty money offered for it.

576
00:38:11,240 --> 00:38:18,760
So here's one set of such problems, the clay millennium problems.

577
00:38:18,760 --> 00:38:26,120
And one is gone, there's still other ways to make a million dollars.

578
00:38:26,120 --> 00:38:33,160
What I want to say is that at least two of these problems are really naturally expressed as

579
00:38:34,120 --> 00:38:40,680
questions about pseudo randomness, you know, our main problem, computer science, and maybe

580
00:38:40,680 --> 00:38:45,960
your main problem, the Riemann hypothesis, I will not spend much time about this.

581
00:38:45,960 --> 00:38:52,920
First one, give a sample, but say briefly, why is it a pseudo randomness question?

582
00:38:52,920 --> 00:38:54,760
Well, what's the pseudo random property?

583
00:38:56,120 --> 00:38:58,760
Being hard to compute is a pseudo random property.

584
00:38:58,760 --> 00:39:00,840
Random functions are hard to compute.

585
00:39:01,480 --> 00:39:06,280
And we ask whether a particular function, let's say the traveling settlement problem or

586
00:39:08,520 --> 00:39:14,440
you know, solving, you know, quadratic systems of quadratic equations over finite fields,

587
00:39:14,440 --> 00:39:19,320
your favorite, whether a particular problem, natural problem is also hard to compute.

588
00:39:19,320 --> 00:39:21,480
That's basically the previous NP question.

589
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:27,720
So it's a question about pseudo randomness, whether a natural element has a pseudo random property.

590
00:39:28,440 --> 00:39:33,800
And I want to talk about the second one, I'll elaborate on this, I don't need to read it,

591
00:39:33,800 --> 00:39:38,840
but again, we'll see a pseudo random property and many of you, of course, will know this

592
00:39:39,800 --> 00:39:40,280
result.

593
00:39:40,280 --> 00:39:46,120
So let's express Riemann hypothesis as a pseudo random property of something.

594
00:39:46,120 --> 00:39:52,280
And if something would be, you know, the universe would be a collection of walks.

595
00:39:53,080 --> 00:39:57,160
So here's a canonical description of the drunkard walk.

596
00:39:58,200 --> 00:40:07,960
You think that there is a pub in location zero in this street, if you want, and somebody walks

597
00:40:08,040 --> 00:40:14,920
into it, and after a few beers come out and start walking up and down the streets, maybe a bit drunk.

598
00:40:15,560 --> 00:40:21,640
So takes each step up with probability half and down with probability half.

599
00:40:23,240 --> 00:40:29,560
And then you can, you know, just run an experiment just and toss random coins and see where

600
00:40:30,200 --> 00:40:32,440
the person gets to after 100 steps.

601
00:40:33,160 --> 00:40:38,520
And even if you didn't know math, you would observe immediately that something weird happens

602
00:40:38,520 --> 00:40:46,200
that despite the fact that the person took, you know, 100 steps, he or she would be only

603
00:40:46,200 --> 00:40:49,000
about 10 paces away from the pub.

604
00:40:49,960 --> 00:40:57,400
So something happens, which we know, and of course, it's an exercise to prove that after

605
00:40:57,400 --> 00:41:02,440
10 steps, almost surely, it was very high probability, the distance from the origin will

606
00:41:02,440 --> 00:41:04,600
be about root 10 steps.

607
00:41:05,720 --> 00:41:13,640
So it's an exercise, of course, and more important for me, it's something we see as pseudo random

608
00:41:13,640 --> 00:41:20,200
property here, right? So the property of a walk staying close to the origin about root

609
00:41:20,200 --> 00:41:25,640
10 from the origin is a pseudo random property because almost every walk has this property.

610
00:41:26,360 --> 00:41:32,680
Okay, good. So now let's talk about the particular walk, which you all like, the Mabuse walk.

611
00:41:34,280 --> 00:41:40,200
You know, so here's the definition, you know, for an integer p of x, you know, the number

612
00:41:40,200 --> 00:41:46,200
of distinct prime divisors, and we just define mu of x, a Mabuse function.

613
00:41:47,400 --> 00:41:53,160
It will be zero if the x is a square divisor and otherwise, you know, it's,

614
00:41:53,160 --> 00:41:55,080
oops, there's a minus one hidden.

615
00:41:56,360 --> 00:41:58,360
Yeah, so it's minus one if it's odd.

616
00:41:59,080 --> 00:42:03,880
I wonder if I can fix this so that it will be visible.

617
00:42:12,680 --> 00:42:13,960
Here is a minus.

618
00:42:13,960 --> 00:42:15,480
Okay, sorry about that.

619
00:42:16,440 --> 00:42:25,560
Okay, anyway, that's a Mabuse function and Mabuse function can think of it as describing a walk.

620
00:42:25,560 --> 00:42:32,440
I mean, it just tells you for every time step, first step, second step, third step, what to do,

621
00:42:32,440 --> 00:42:37,240
whether to go up the street or down the street. And let's suppose we allow also that sometimes you

622
00:42:37,240 --> 00:42:43,000
stay where you are. So I'm changing a bit the definition of a walk, but that doesn't matter

623
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:50,600
much. And now, what are we wondering about is this particular walk is just a description of a

624
00:42:50,600 --> 00:42:56,600
walk like before, but only it's deterministic, not random. And we ask whether it's, you know,

625
00:42:57,240 --> 00:43:02,840
has it stood on the property? Does it stay close to the origin? And as, you know,

626
00:43:03,880 --> 00:43:09,560
probably most of you in this audience know, that's basically the lima hypothesis, right?

627
00:43:09,960 --> 00:43:18,760
If for every end this work says around the origin, then the lima hypothesis is true and vice

628
00:43:18,760 --> 00:43:25,320
versa. So it's another formulation, a very convenient formulation, the one that you can tell

629
00:43:25,320 --> 00:43:32,600
your, you know, your family and friends about without zeta functions about what the lima hypothesis

630
00:43:32,600 --> 00:43:41,320
really is. So, but anyway, very conveniently stated as the pseudorandom is a question about

631
00:43:41,320 --> 00:43:50,760
the particular pseudorandom. Okay, so these are basically the examples we see one more soon,

632
00:43:50,760 --> 00:43:58,760
but I want to get now to the point I was talking about in the beginning. How does this

633
00:43:58,760 --> 00:44:06,440
point of view, what did it lead us to understand about applications of randomness,

634
00:44:06,440 --> 00:44:09,640
you know, to, especially to probabilistic algorithms and

635
00:44:13,320 --> 00:44:19,960
some major results, both technically and conceptually understanding

636
00:44:21,320 --> 00:44:26,200
some fundamental tools about the power and limitation of randomness,

637
00:44:26,200 --> 00:44:31,960
at least in computational settings. Okay, and actually quite beyond, but I will probably not

638
00:44:31,960 --> 00:44:39,880
have time to talk about this. Okay, so let me summarize this on one slide and I'll elaborate

639
00:44:39,880 --> 00:44:49,080
a bit on one. So the three possible worlds I want to consider are the following. One is the

640
00:44:50,200 --> 00:44:54,760
world in which we have perfect randomness in which we could, you know, do everything we want,

641
00:44:54,760 --> 00:45:02,520
we just are guaranteed a stream of unbiased independent quantos. The second world is a world

642
00:45:02,520 --> 00:45:10,840
that was maybe alluded to by some of the companies that use physical devices or physical phenomena

643
00:45:10,840 --> 00:45:19,320
to create random bits or pseudorandom bits. This is a world where we have some unpredictable

644
00:45:19,320 --> 00:45:25,400
phenomena, you can think of sunspots or stock market behavior or radioactive decay or quantum

645
00:45:25,400 --> 00:45:34,440
phenomena, your favorite. In each of them, we feel there's some entropy, we feel there's some

646
00:45:34,440 --> 00:45:39,240
unpredictability, if we want to know, you know, of course, there are not independent events,

647
00:45:40,280 --> 00:45:46,120
if you want to know whether tomorrow it's probably a good guess to say that it will be like today.

648
00:45:46,120 --> 00:45:54,200
So they're correlated and they are not sometimes biased and so on. Of course,

649
00:45:54,200 --> 00:46:00,200
we can manipulate them and try to use them then in one of these applications. Anyway,

650
00:46:00,200 --> 00:46:07,720
this is a world in which there's some entropy in the sequence we see, but it's not necessarily

651
00:46:07,720 --> 00:46:13,800
independent unbiased, you know, uniform distribution. And the third world is, you know,

652
00:46:13,800 --> 00:46:19,000
there's the other world is deterministic, there is no randomness at all, it's all in our imagination,

653
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:25,720
everything's predictable, what can we do then? We can just, everything's deterministic.

654
00:46:26,600 --> 00:46:31,720
So, you know, we saw these applications in case we have perfect randomness,

655
00:46:31,720 --> 00:46:37,960
this question, what survives otherwise? And in the next two boxes are really major,

656
00:46:37,960 --> 00:46:44,520
these major understandings. So in the first, it turns out that all probabilistic algorithms

657
00:46:45,160 --> 00:46:52,120
can be made to function as they did, even in the presence of very weak randomness.

658
00:46:53,160 --> 00:46:58,520
This is the subject of what is called extractor theory, randomness extraction,

659
00:46:59,640 --> 00:47:06,680
long, long sequence of works. And it is all about purifying randomness, taking, you know,

660
00:47:06,680 --> 00:47:12,440
weak random sources, sources that are biased and dependent, and somehow extracting

661
00:47:13,720 --> 00:47:21,400
audience or extracting anyway, their entropy in pure form, they may make to look maybe

662
00:47:21,400 --> 00:47:26,200
shorter sequences, but they look like they were perfectly random. So that's one,

663
00:47:27,800 --> 00:47:33,000
you know, one theory, one major result, sequence of results.

664
00:47:33,480 --> 00:47:41,000
The second one is what happens if the world is deterministic. And in this case,

665
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:46,920
we just don't know how to move an inch without an assumption, but it's okay,

666
00:47:46,920 --> 00:47:53,800
the assumption is something that we live with, and believe. So I want to assume,

667
00:47:53,800 --> 00:47:57,000
I put it in quotes, because I don't want to formally define it,

668
00:47:57,880 --> 00:48:04,600
well, you can ask me, but something like P is different than NP. You can

669
00:48:05,320 --> 00:48:14,440
satisfy yourself, at least in that the whole electronic commerce world you live in assumes

670
00:48:14,440 --> 00:48:20,120
far less than that. It's assumed that factoring or discrete logarithm or some other computational

671
00:48:20,120 --> 00:48:25,320
problem in NP is difficult, it's exponentially difficult. And that's the nature of the assumption

672
00:48:25,320 --> 00:48:32,680
that we need. Okay, so we assume something like there exists a house function. That's what we assume.

673
00:48:32,680 --> 00:48:40,920
And now under this assumption, again, you know, we don't need randomness. All fast algorithms for

674
00:48:40,920 --> 00:48:45,800
with for every practical purposes are all algorithms. Fast, I mean those we can run in our

675
00:48:45,800 --> 00:48:51,320
lifetimes, all efficient algorithms that are probabilistic can be replaced,

676
00:48:52,280 --> 00:49:00,440
to say every fast probabilistic algorithms has a deterministic counterpart. There's another

677
00:49:00,440 --> 00:49:07,800
algorithm which is deterministic does exactly the same thing has no error. And it's not much slower

678
00:49:07,800 --> 00:49:14,440
than the original. This is a consequence of another theory, which, you know, but sort of the paradigm

679
00:49:14,440 --> 00:49:19,880
underlying it, underlying it is the hardness versus randomness paradigm, namely you can use

680
00:49:20,680 --> 00:49:26,840
house function to generate good enough randomness deterministically. Again, long sequence of

681
00:49:26,840 --> 00:49:34,680
works several decades spent and the consequences is this understanding. So in other words, it seems

682
00:49:34,680 --> 00:49:42,920
like, you know, randomness for the purpose of algorithms is far weaker than may have been

683
00:49:42,920 --> 00:49:49,640
suspected initially with their power or the seeming success in the absence of the deterministic

684
00:49:49,640 --> 00:49:57,160
algorithms for lots of problems we want to solve. Okay. I want to say something about

685
00:49:58,840 --> 00:50:05,480
doing with time. Just give a hint. Okay, good. I started the seven minutes late. So that's good.

686
00:50:06,360 --> 00:50:08,280
Take five more minutes of your time.

687
00:50:12,120 --> 00:50:16,600
I want to tell you something about this structural theory and randomness verification.

688
00:50:17,160 --> 00:50:24,360
And yeah, we saw that perfect randomness has lots of applications. And supposedly in reality,

689
00:50:24,360 --> 00:50:33,320
we have, you know, this sort of weak random sources is bias dependent sources. And I want

690
00:50:33,320 --> 00:50:39,000
to assume for this, you know, this is only part of the story. I want to assume that

691
00:50:42,840 --> 00:50:48,120
there are several of them, and they're independent of each other. So let's say we have three or five

692
00:50:48,120 --> 00:50:53,960
or 10 such phenomena that we can tap, they're all weak, you know, they all contain maybe

693
00:50:55,400 --> 00:51:00,040
an end bit sequence will contain only n over 100 bits of entropy or maybe square

694
00:51:00,120 --> 00:51:07,080
with n of bits of entropy. But I have several of them. So I want to assume that, you know,

695
00:51:07,080 --> 00:51:13,400
sunspots don't affect stock market behavior. Some people believe that it does actually,

696
00:51:13,400 --> 00:51:19,400
but let's assume it's not. So I have several sources. And the question is, if I have such a,

697
00:51:19,400 --> 00:51:27,400
you know, collection of outputs of such phenomena, can I transform it into maybe a

698
00:51:27,400 --> 00:51:33,800
shorter sequence of something that looks, you know, exactly or almost exactly statistically

699
00:51:33,800 --> 00:51:39,160
exactly like the uniform distribution. That's a subject of example theory. And I want to give

700
00:51:39,160 --> 00:51:45,480
you a hint into one result that, you know, uses a pseudorandom property. So we'll connect the

701
00:51:46,360 --> 00:51:51,960
two parts of the talk. So I want to talk about one more pseudorandom property,

702
00:51:52,920 --> 00:52:00,520
you know, it's a property of tables of matrices of numbers. Okay, so think of a random

703
00:52:01,400 --> 00:52:05,800
n by n matrix with entries in n. Think you're working more than

704
00:52:07,800 --> 00:52:14,920
elements between one element. Okay, and what, when do I call, you know, what's the property I'm after?

705
00:52:14,920 --> 00:52:20,120
The property is that if I look at any sub matrix, small sub matrix, okay,

706
00:52:22,040 --> 00:52:29,160
then I see lots of numbers. So let's quantify this. Yeah, this is certainly that, you know,

707
00:52:29,160 --> 00:52:35,640
what you will see in, you know, in such random examples. Every small window, which is a

708
00:52:35,640 --> 00:52:40,200
some matrix, some matrix, I mean, in general, a subset of rows crosses a subset of columns.

709
00:52:40,920 --> 00:52:47,320
Let's say, you know, if I pick a k by k window, the k rows and k columns, and I look at this k

710
00:52:47,320 --> 00:52:54,040
squared entries, I see significantly more than k distinct entries. I mean, you would expect,

711
00:52:54,040 --> 00:52:59,400
actually, it will be close to k squared if k is small enough. And k is small enough, k is maybe

712
00:52:59,400 --> 00:53:04,680
n to the point one. So in a random table, you know, surely you will have this property for

713
00:53:04,680 --> 00:53:11,640
every window. I want to stress, I want for every window. It's a sort of random property. It's an

714
00:53:11,640 --> 00:53:17,720
easy theorem counting argument to prove that a random matrix will have this property.

715
00:53:19,480 --> 00:53:26,520
And here's the question of the same nature. Can such matrices be constructed explicitly?

716
00:53:27,160 --> 00:53:33,560
Is there, you know, just give me a matrix of numbers in one to n by n matrix where, of course,

717
00:53:33,560 --> 00:53:42,440
a family of matrices so that every k by k window has at least k to the 1.1 distinct entries, say.

718
00:53:44,600 --> 00:53:53,480
Okay, I mean, we mathematicians have lots of examples for the matrices we like that look

719
00:53:53,480 --> 00:53:59,240
random in various ways. But I mean, let's start from, you know, every case could give you a matrix,

720
00:53:59,240 --> 00:54:05,560
right? I mean, second grader can give you the addition table. So here's the, here's the matrix.

721
00:54:05,560 --> 00:54:11,400
Let's say we wrap more than the numbers. I didn't do it here, but we wrap the numbers more than.

722
00:54:13,080 --> 00:54:18,680
Is it good? Is this to do random in this sense? Does every small window have few entries? Well,

723
00:54:18,680 --> 00:54:25,880
of course not. I mean, we've seen in, if we look along an arithmetic progression

724
00:54:26,760 --> 00:54:33,080
in rows and columns, we will see just a linear number in k by k matrix will see just a linear

725
00:54:33,080 --> 00:54:40,920
number of distinct entries. So it's certainly bad. Okay, well, we can go to third grade and think about

726
00:54:40,920 --> 00:54:49,000
the multiplication table. And we can ask whether this is good. And of course, the answer is no

727
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:56,520
for the same reason if we look at this rectangle doesn't show it. But if you look at the geometric

728
00:54:56,520 --> 00:55:01,800
progression, long rows and columns, again, you'll see only a linear number of entries.

729
00:55:02,520 --> 00:55:10,600
And this somehow reminds me of a lesson that von Neumann was saying or attributed to von Neumann

730
00:55:10,600 --> 00:55:16,440
that anyone who considers a mathematical method to produce random digits is of course in a state of

731
00:55:16,760 --> 00:55:23,480
sin. But anybody who knows the history knows that von Neumann ignores his own advice and of course

732
00:55:23,480 --> 00:55:32,440
use pseudo random generators based on mathematical means. And in fact, you should do it in this case

733
00:55:32,440 --> 00:55:36,760
too. And what I'm going to say is the result that probably many of you are familiar with

734
00:55:38,680 --> 00:55:43,880
is that while each of these tables, each of these matrices, the addition one, the multiplication

735
00:55:43,880 --> 00:55:52,280
one is bad. Their combination is good. Starting with other similarity in the case of integers

736
00:55:52,280 --> 00:55:57,080
and then we'll get passed out in the final field case, let's say more than or more p.

737
00:55:58,520 --> 00:56:05,720
If you do it more the prime, then every window will be good in one of these tables. So if you

738
00:56:05,720 --> 00:56:11,080
look at the union of numbers you see in the, you know, in the window above and window below,

739
00:56:11,080 --> 00:56:19,160
there'll be plenty of entries as many as you need. So what does it mean in terms of, so first of all

740
00:56:20,200 --> 00:56:25,640
we found, you know, by cheating a bit, by taking two tables, we found

741
00:56:27,400 --> 00:56:32,680
elements that have this pseudo random property which are explicit. In fact, they are very simple

742
00:56:32,680 --> 00:56:39,960
and easy to compute. And this was used in one of the early solutions to this problem of

743
00:56:39,960 --> 00:56:50,040
extractor randomness. Basically, some and products are independent. That's the message from this

744
00:56:50,600 --> 00:56:57,880
very important theorem and mixing them increases entropy. So one way to view this extractor

745
00:57:00,520 --> 00:57:07,480
is that if you have three such sources, you can add the first two and multiply by the third,

746
00:57:07,480 --> 00:57:14,840
you know, they think of them as integers more p. The entropy, total entropy will have increased.

747
00:57:15,400 --> 00:57:22,760
The entropy rate will have increased and therefore you can repeat it several times and approach,

748
00:57:23,880 --> 00:57:31,720
you know, perfect randomness. So that's one example of an extractor using this particular pseudo random

749
00:57:31,720 --> 00:57:37,480
property of tables or methods. Okay, so let me summarize.

750
00:57:40,760 --> 00:57:47,800
Some things we have seen, some important messages. I want to go back to this really important point

751
00:57:47,800 --> 00:57:52,760
that, you know, randomness is in the eye of the beholder or in the computational power of the

752
00:57:52,760 --> 00:57:59,640
beholder. This is a subjective definition and this very important point of view that leads to this

753
00:58:00,600 --> 00:58:10,840
understanding. It's also pragmatic in the sense that you can study the use of randomness

754
00:58:11,880 --> 00:58:19,640
or the intended use of randomness and maybe by understanding it you can remove the use of randomness

755
00:58:19,720 --> 00:58:30,840
in it. And the impact of this kind of point of view is that you can remove randomness from

756
00:58:30,840 --> 00:58:38,680
probabilistic algorithms even in situations where you have very weak random sources or even assuming

757
00:58:38,680 --> 00:58:45,560
hardness in a world which is just purely deterministic. I should maybe add here that because

758
00:58:45,560 --> 00:58:52,760
you are familiar with this example but may not be familiar with how related it is to the lecture.

759
00:58:52,760 --> 00:58:59,640
So you all know that there is a deterministic polynomial time algorithm to certify prime

760
00:58:59,640 --> 00:59:08,760
to determine whether a number and integer is prime or not. You also probably know that there

761
00:59:08,760 --> 00:59:12,760
are lots of probabilistic algorithms for this before the deterministic one was known and of

762
00:59:12,760 --> 00:59:20,680
course a question of doing this sufficiently is extremely odd. Gauss talks about it quite explicitly

763
00:59:22,040 --> 00:59:28,280
and well Granville has a beautiful survey in which he sites in the beginning this except from

764
00:59:28,920 --> 00:59:38,120
Gauss's discussion on this arithmetic where he basically calls to the community basically says

765
00:59:38,120 --> 00:59:44,520
it's a disgrace we don't yet have an efficient algorithm for either primality or factoring.

766
00:59:45,320 --> 00:59:52,600
Anyway the way what was I think less people know is that the way that the deterministic

767
00:59:53,400 --> 01:00:00,680
algorithm was obtained by Agarwal Kayal and Saxena was the following. They've designed

768
01:00:01,560 --> 01:00:08,840
a new probabilistic algorithm for primality testing and then in fact this was earlier work of

769
01:00:10,680 --> 01:00:21,800
Agarwal and another student and the work of Agarwal Kayal and Saxena is a

770
01:00:21,800 --> 01:00:26,040
de-randomization of this algorithm. It's a way of understanding the way the algorithm

771
01:00:26,040 --> 01:00:32,920
used this randomness and constructing a specific pseudorandom generator which fools it and therefore

772
01:00:32,920 --> 01:00:41,400
makes it deterministic. Okay so anyway there are many other probabilistic algorithms for which we

773
01:00:41,400 --> 01:00:51,640
know it only under some assumptions like p different. Next pseudorandomness so what was used is the

774
01:00:52,600 --> 01:01:01,560
general very high level definition of pseudorandomness which connects basically like

775
01:01:01,560 --> 01:01:07,240
in the example of primality connects the property the pseudorandom property with the

776
01:01:07,240 --> 01:01:13,880
application in mind maybe the algorithm you want to the randomness. The study of pseudorandomness

777
01:01:13,880 --> 01:01:20,280
captures many basic problems and areas both in math and in computer science. I could have

778
01:01:20,280 --> 01:01:24,920
talked another hour on you know structural versus randomness paradigm which is very much

779
01:01:24,920 --> 01:01:37,480
part of a pseudorandomness study. It captures things like this name I think was given by Tao gave

780
01:01:37,480 --> 01:01:43,640
surveys of examples like this and you know many like some other regularity lemma or it's used

781
01:01:43,640 --> 01:01:49,240
in high math progressions in the primes it's used in boosting and machine learning and it's used

782
01:01:49,240 --> 01:01:56,600
basically in the other applications of it in analysis and PDEs and you know that's

783
01:01:57,720 --> 01:02:08,520
definitely in number theory and yeah so it stems from a very

784
01:02:09,480 --> 01:02:16,440
you know pseudorandomness like approach to a very wide array of problems.

785
01:02:17,160 --> 01:02:22,680
And the last thing is that pseudorandom objects that you you build for particular purposes in

786
01:02:22,680 --> 01:02:29,960
particular you know extractor for extractor theory or expander graphs or various codes or something

787
01:02:30,280 --> 01:02:37,640
turn out to actually they were initially designed for fault tolerant circuits

788
01:02:38,840 --> 01:02:41,960
or that's at least what Pinsker has in mind as an application.

789
01:02:44,600 --> 01:02:51,240
Often they find many many many more applications than they used to there they somehow fundamental

790
01:02:51,240 --> 01:02:58,760
turn out many of them are fundamental in other contexts than you know I think you must have

791
01:02:58,760 --> 01:03:05,000
heard of is high dimensional expander another example of a pseudorandom object of a mysterious

792
01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:11,160
nature that we are trying to understand and yeah there are many more so let me end with this thank you.
