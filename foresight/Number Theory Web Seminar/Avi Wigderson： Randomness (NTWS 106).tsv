0	6120	When the organizers asked me to give a talk in this seminar,
6120	10160	I told them that I have no new results or maybe no old results
10160	12280	even in number theory.
12280	19120	And I can talk about some general topics
19120	21840	in my field of interest in complexity theory.
21840	24400	And they said that it could be great or good.
24400	30280	So I'll talk about randomness, which is one of my favorite topics.
30280	36000	I want to talk about this randomness.
36000	40360	It's something that I guess mankind was always interested in.
40360	44720	And it's a topic you can talk to almost everyone on the street
44720	53640	about lack and chance and unpredictability and informally.
53640	56680	But you can, you know, mathematicians study the randomness
56680	63400	in variety of forms in probability and statistics and so on.
63400	70320	And then physicists are extremely curious about randomness
70320	74640	and the meaning of randomness and a lot of scientific interest
74640	75640	in randomness.
75640	77880	So it's a very, very broad topic.
77880	83840	And people have sometimes very strong opinions about randomness
83840	84920	and its meaning and so on.
84920	88720	So what I want to tell you about today is this computational
88720	92680	complexity point of view of randomness.
92680	98280	And of course, this is a very general, high-level, non-technical talk.
98280	102640	It will be a lot of things you'll see you would have known.
103520	110080	So I would like to stress it's a new conceptual element.
110080	112800	So there'll be lots of examples.
112800	119520	And I'll tell you when something new is coming of importance.
119520	123200	OK, so what's now is OK.
126360	128320	The plan is, first of all, I'm going
128320	132240	to talk only about discrete events.
132240	136400	For number theory, this is usually OK.
136400	138240	So what's perfect randomness for me?
138240	144160	Perfect that the perfect random event will be a coin toss.
144160	148840	Something that has probability of heads and tails equal to half.
148840	151600	And if there are many of them, they are independent.
151600	153480	So I always show this slide.
153480	157640	Which of these two sequences of 20 letters is more probable?
157640	159320	I know you know the answer.
159320	160480	They're equally probable.
160480	164760	So that is what we would call the uniform distribution
164760	166560	or the distribution with full entropy.
166560	170080	This would be like an ideal model of randomness.
170080	172000	Perfect randomness.
172000	176520	And for the first 15 minutes or so,
176520	183000	I'll just go through examples of different applications,
183000	187360	you can call them, or ways in which randomness is used.
187400	188600	Places it is used.
188600	192480	And the main thing in the back of our mind
192480	196200	should be, can we really do that?
196200	200880	I mean, what do we do if we don't have perfect independence?
200880	203880	Can any of them be done without it?
203880	206320	And in order to understand this, we'll
206320	212520	move to define pseudo randomness, which roughly speaking,
212520	216440	is just a, you can think of collectively deterministic
216440	220280	structures that share some properties with random ones.
220280	221240	Some properties.
221240	224200	And we'll talk about different such properties.
224200	227120	And that will help us understand that.
227120	229080	We'll see many examples.
229080	235240	And then I will go back to the basic question of what
235240	238960	can we do in a world in which there is no perfect randomness?
238960	241200	Maybe there is weak randomness or no randomness
241200	243680	and we'll roughly discuss the meaning of this.
243680	247000	All pretty informal.
247000	251240	Of course, underlying the main messages
251240	254600	are formal theorems that move them that you
254600	256400	can quiz me about that.
256400	263000	OK, so let me start with the utility of randomness.
263000	265880	And as I said, the back of our mind,
265880	269040	you'll see this icon in every slide.
269080	272520	You can ask yourself, or maybe you have asked yourself,
272520	275520	where are the random bits for this coming from?
275520	278480	And we'll discuss that later.
278480	281440	OK, so the most basic example that everybody
281440	284960	gives to the power of randomness is just sampling.
284960	290080	You want to know what will be the fraction of people
290080	293080	who will vote red in a particular country.
293080	297640	You just, even if it's huge, it's millions of people.
297680	301600	If you sample 2,000 at random, but completely at random,
301600	305040	a perfect subset of 2,000 at random,
305040	309000	then you know that with probability at least 99%
309000	313120	over this choice, the percentage of red votes
313120	315600	in the sample and the red votes in the population
315600	320560	will be within 2% of the actual percentage.
320560	325360	And we know it's hugely powerful.
325360	333240	First of all, we know that these numbers, 2 and 1%,
333240	335640	don't depend on the size of the population.
335640	338280	That's basically the law of large numbers.
338280	341600	It's a very powerful way of using randomness.
341600	344360	And of course, the main point is that if we didn't have
344360	348840	randomness here, it's not clear how we would get even an estimate
348840	354640	up to 2% without asking 98% of the population what they think.
354640	357120	So that's a very, very strong demonstration.
357120	360120	And I want to move to less obvious ones.
364040	365120	Here's one.
365120	370480	I give you this portion of the plane,
370480	372120	the proportion of the grid.
372120	377880	And I ask you, in how many ways can you tie this with dominoes?
377880	380040	You don't have to look at the colors here.
380040	383600	Just in how many ways can you tie this region with dominoes?
383600	385360	It can be this rectangular region.
385360	388640	It could be any other region.
388640	394120	And this is a basic question, a basic counting question.
394120	397680	Of course, it doesn't come out of nowhere.
397680	400360	I mean, it's picturesque, but it's also important.
400360	403200	It's got a dimer problem in physics.
403200	407040	And for diatomic molecules, it captures
407040	412000	thermodynamic properties of that matter.
412160	415360	You can understand from it free energy, phase transitions,
415360	416800	and stuff like that.
416800	418960	So it's also an important problem.
418960	422840	But the main problem is that there can be,
422840	424240	even the region is small.
424240	425760	It's 1,000 by 1,000.
425760	430680	The number of such configurations can be used.
430680	433960	And here's a very important result
433960	437440	from about 20 years ago, Jerome Cichlial Vigoda.
437440	441520	They found a way to approximately count
441520	444760	the number of dominoes tiling in any region.
444760	446040	In fact, it's more general.
446040	450280	It's the number of matchings in any graph.
450280	453200	Doesn't have to be planar.
453200	456480	The type of algorithm, I'm not going to describe algorithm,
456480	458720	but the nature of it is some people know.
458720	461360	It's what's called the Monte Carlo method.
461360	464760	The number of matchings can be exponential
464760	468040	in the size of the region, so the size of the graph.
468040	472280	So you cannot just write it down or look at all of them.
472280	476080	There's a sort of Markov chain analyzing this.
476080	482040	And anyway, figuring out that this Markov chain converges
482040	484040	quickly is highly non-trivial.
484040	487640	And that gives a probabilistic algorithm
487640	491080	for this problem for approximately counting the number.
491080	493760	We know that counting exactly the number
493760	496320	is a difficult problem, and I will not go into this.
496320	500840	So this approximation problem can be done fast probabilistically.
500840	504960	But the best deterministic algorithm known
504960	506920	requires exponential timing.
506920	510040	We can do really better than just trying all possibilities
510040	512240	and adding them up.
512240	516760	So I want to stress that this is the best known deterministic
516760	517280	algorithm.
517280	519920	There may be faster ones that we haven't discovered yet,
519920	523120	and actually we'll see at the end that maybe there
523120	525440	is the faster one.
525440	528920	OK, so there are many, many such examples.
528920	530640	And this is really the key application
530640	533040	that I want to eventually discuss.
533040	535440	What can we do of randomness, namely
535440	537840	to probabilistic algorithm, understanding
537840	541480	the power of randomness in computation.
545000	550000	Many examples, many of them, they are all over mathematics
550000	552320	in every field of mathematics.
552400	556120	In number theory, the problem of finding large primes,
556120	560200	just give me a thousand big primes, thousand digits prime.
560200	563200	We don't know any deterministic way to do that.
563200	566560	We can certify primality quickly by now,
566560	572360	but we don't know how to just find a large number, which
572360	575280	is prime deterministically.
575280	580200	Factoring multivariate polynomials over finite fields,
580200	582960	it's another example approximating
582960	588200	the volume of convex sets in high dimensions,
588200	590760	computing large free eco-efficient of multivariate
590760	594840	functions that are given by a program, say, that circuit.
594840	597840	In all of these things, in all these cases,
597840	599840	and there are many more examples,
599840	602440	there are fast probabilistic algorithms,
602440	606240	in many cases, that are highly non-trivial.
606240	610040	And on the other hand, the best known deterministic
610040	615000	algorithm for each of them requires exponential time.
615000	618840	So we'd like to know whether there are deterministic ones
618840	619520	or not.
619520	621120	Sorry, Avi, can I ask?
621120	623760	For finding a large prime, why don't you just start?
623760	626560	If you want to find a prime above n, you start at n,
626560	630000	and then you use, we know the prime is in p.
630000	632200	So you check if n is a prime, then check of n plus 1
632200	633760	is a prime, and by the prime number theorem,
633760	636760	you take your log n steps before you find one.
636840	641360	If you believe the prime, no, no, it will not take your log n.
641360	646960	I mean, the best we know is root n or something like that.
646960	648560	We don't know that there is a prime.
648560	649560	You need cramming.
649560	651520	Prime number theorem does not guarantee
651520	654520	that every interval of log n is a prime.
654520	656360	I mean, the gaps between the primes.
656360	658640	OK, so that part of it is still probabilistic,
658640	660400	even if I can check the numbers.
660400	661600	Yeah, yeah, we don't know.
661600	664000	I mean, any advance on any of the expressions
664000	666400	would be extremely interesting.
666400	673280	Yeah, I mean, there was a large project in this,
673280	675400	I forgot what the last one was.
675400	677680	Polymath.
677680	678520	Sorry?
678520	679960	Polymath.
679960	684240	Yeah, polymath, the projects that Tim Giles and Terry Tao
684240	687680	organized some 10 years ago just focused
687680	690840	on this particular problem, finding large primes.
690840	693920	And yeah, this was one of the polymath's failures.
693920	695800	I mean, I think it was really interesting
695800	696600	what went on there.
696600	702680	But anyway, yeah, but it's good to just stress that when
702680	707080	we say n, large n, we mean like 1,000 digits.
707080	710600	So our number, we start with 1 and then
710600	714920	have some 1,000 digits after it, and it's prime.
714920	717960	Find one deterministically.
717960	718480	Yeah.
718480	719840	I'll just interrupt for a second.
719840	722760	I mean, in practice, you can find large primes very quickly
722760	725080	because we know that you don't have
725080	726520	to go very far to find a prime.
726520	728840	It's the question.
728840	730000	There's no practice here.
730000	732360	I want a theorem.
732360	734080	I want a theorem.
734080	734560	Yeah.
734560	737040	No, Joe, but just along Alex's side.
737040	739680	Yeah, there are lots of heuristics for lots of problems.
739680	744840	And yeah, but anyway, these are just examples.
744840	749960	It's just no surprise that you are interested in this one.
749960	753480	But I think it's a good challenge for number theory.
753480	754960	It's a really interesting one.
754960	758240	Of course, we have an algorithm that
758240	762800	is deterministic that is conjectured to work very rapidly,
762800	764240	but we cannot prove that.
764240	766000	Yeah, but this is the only question.
766000	767440	I want something provable.
767440	769040	I want a theorem.
769040	771800	So in all these cases, the probabilistic algorithm
771800	775760	will guarantee to find with the antenna probability of prime
775760	777080	and it will certify that.
777080	778920	And we want to do it without randomness.
778920	779800	Can we do it?
779800	782480	And let's stop the discussion of this.
782480	783680	Sorry, I made progress.
783680	789440	But yeah, it's a great problem, this particular one.
789440	790240	OK, good.
790240	792680	So these are examples of probabilistic algorithms.
792680	795280	I want to give you examples of just some other things
795280	803040	where randomness is used of a different nature, several such
803040	805760	examples.
805920	808760	Distributed computation, randomness
808760	813240	can make not just an exponential improvement in time,
813240	816200	but an infinite one, in that they
816200	819920	can make some problems that are provably impossible,
819920	822000	become possible with randomness.
822000	824800	These are two picturesque examples
824800	827760	of fundamental problems in distributed computing.
827760	829920	One is the dining philosophers problem.
829920	832320	The second is the Byzantine generals problem.
832320	834080	As you can tell, these guys know how
834080	838560	to pick names for their problems.
838560	841640	So in both cases, I will not explain this.
841640	846200	It's a bit beside the main course of the lecture,
846200	849320	but I want to stress that these are fundamental problems
849320	852720	in distributed computation, in asynchronous distributed
852720	854320	computation.
854320	858040	One is about consensus and one is about coordination.
858040	863200	And theorems that there is no deterministic solution,
863240	865600	whatever that means, I didn't define it.
865600	869080	But if the actors in this distributed system
869080	873280	have randomness, then it's possible to solve them.
873280	877560	And in fact, these algorithms are used.
877560	881440	So here, the gap can be arbitrary between randomness
881440	882480	and determinism.
882480	883840	And that's provable.
883840	886960	So we will not talk about the applications here,
886960	891600	but another demonstration.
891600	898880	Here's another one that goes even beyond the randomness
898880	899920	helps to do things.
899920	901680	It also helps to define things.
904440	907640	In game theory, which is supposed
907640	909720	to model rational behavior, we try
909720	911880	to understand in strategic situation
911880	915640	what would actors, players, agents do.
915640	921120	Here's a very simple example from a game of Auman called
921120	928680	the chicken game, which is often done in game theory,
928680	932760	represented by a matrix of payoffs for two players.
932760	937000	In this, you can imagine that this game represents
937000	941240	two sort of macho drivers driving towards each other
941240	942240	on a narrow road.
942240	944720	And they can either, each of them
944720	950840	can either sway to the side or continue to drive.
950840	953920	And like being cautious or aggressive.
953920	957000	And the payoffs to each of them are written here,
957000	959520	where you can see in the bottom right
959520	960920	that if they are both aggressive,
960920	963520	then no one deviates.
963520	965400	They both basically die.
969000	974200	But anyway, you ask what would players do in such a situation?
974200	975880	What would be a rational behavior?
975880	979320	And as I'm sure most of you know,
979320	983960	there is a key concept that John Nash defined,
983960	985680	the Nash equilibrium.
985680	990840	You want a strategy for each pair of strategies,
990840	995480	such that given the other one, you would not change yours.
995480	998120	So it's kind of a stability requirement
998120	1003360	on a solution concept.
1003360	1006880	And it's a very natural one to choose.
1006880	1012160	And of course, Nash didn't get the Nobel Prize just
1012160	1013720	for the definition.
1013720	1016880	He also had a theorem, is that every game,
1016880	1019200	every strategic game of this nature,
1019200	1023240	no matter how many players, no matter how many strategies,
1023240	1025680	there is always such a solution.
1025680	1027640	This solution concept is universal.
1027640	1030400	It always exists.
1030400	1033080	What is interesting and important for us
1033080	1036440	is that, again, as many of you know,
1036440	1041040	this depends on the ability of players to toss coins.
1041040	1043520	So the strategies they will choose,
1043520	1046840	the strategies that exist are mixed strategies,
1046840	1048920	namely the random strategies.
1048920	1055880	In this particular game, there's a unique such equilibrium.
1055880	1058040	With these numbers, it happens to me
1058040	1060720	to be cautious with probability 3 quarter
1060840	1063280	and aggressive with probability 1 quarter.
1063280	1066560	If you know that the other driver behaves like this,
1066560	1070600	you would stay with your choice.
1070600	1076200	Anyway, the main point here is that if you require
1076200	1077960	or you don't allow them randomness,
1077960	1082680	if they are deterministic, there's no equilibrium.
1082680	1087520	So here's another place where there are several points here.
1087520	1089920	This is something that exists with randomness
1089920	1092440	and does not exist without randomness.
1092440	1099920	Another is that you can ask yourself, here, it's really important.
1099920	1102960	I mean, are people in life, in economic situations,
1102960	1104680	speaking strategies like this?
1104680	1107160	And are they using randomness and so on?
1107160	1110960	Anyway, but that's just another example.
1110960	1114840	Example closer to computer science
1114840	1118920	and to life of everybody is cryptography,
1118920	1125400	where randomness is basically you can't live home without it.
1125400	1128240	Everything depends on it.
1128240	1131360	The very definition of a secret needs randomness.
1131360	1134000	I mean, if you Shannon already pointed out
1134000	1140600	that formalized using this notion of entropy and so on,
1140600	1143600	a secret is basically as good as entropy in it.
1143600	1147880	I mean, if you pick your 90s password randomly,
1147880	1153360	then my chances of guessing it is exactly 10 to the 9.
1153360	1157960	If, on the other hand, you pick it as the phone number of one
1157960	1162200	of your friends, then I probably have a better chance of guessing it.
1162200	1166280	It will have much less sense of it.
1166280	1169000	But then, of course, randomness is absolutely essential
1169000	1177600	to any notion we define in cryptography, basically everything.
1177600	1183840	And also there, and this is something that's practically used all the time,
1183840	1187840	you can ask yourself what randomness is used there
1187840	1192400	and is it perfect as the definitions all assume,
1192400	1197920	perfect randomness like the public scargoite, all assume perfect randomness.
1197920	1199760	Where is it coming from?
1199760	1202800	Yeah, randomness is used in lots of other places, of course.
1202800	1206120	And also there you may want the random bits
1206120	1210200	coming from in the casino and so on.
1210200	1213680	So that's about the set of examples I wanted to talk about.
1213680	1220760	And it's clear that randomness is an essential part of lots of our lives.
1220760	1225360	So now I want to ask the question we asked before.
1225360	1227320	Where are these random bits coming from?
1227320	1230800	Let's say in particular applications that we have seen.
1230800	1235680	And I don't know about you, but when I don't know the answer
1235680	1240760	to a question I asked Google, I'm sure you do many times.
1240760	1245160	So you feed Google through random bits.
1245160	1245880	What do you get?
1245880	1251560	Well, 10 years ago when this slide is from, I got four million answers.
1251560	1255640	Probably today there will be 400 million answers.
1255640	1264520	But you start at the answer more or less is basically you buy them.
1264520	1266840	You want good random bits, you buy them.
1266840	1271120	At least there are lots of companies that will sell you random bits.
1271120	1275360	And then you can ask yourself, well, where do they take their random bits from?
1275360	1279240	And OK, well, you can read what they say.
1279240	1287520	I mean, some take it from various physical phenomena, which is interesting
1287520	1290440	because they seem somewhat unpredictable.
1290440	1295160	Some take them from other physical phenomena, which are maybe more unpredictable,
1295160	1298280	like quantum behavior.
1298280	1303760	If you wonder about casinos at least some years ago, they were all using this chip
1303760	1306640	of this company and you can wonder whether it works or not.
1306640	1312040	I mean, whether what they are doing does generate random bits or random in what sense.
1312040	1314320	Anyway, we would like to understand this question.
1314320	1316480	What is randomness?
1316480	1324320	In fact, what is randomness to any particular purpose that randomness is good?
1324320	1332360	And so now I really want to come to a central definition.
1332360	1342800	And yeah, this time to the next slide is maybe the most important slide of the talk.
1342800	1347240	We are trying to define or understand how to define the randomness.
1347240	1353360	So it's taken from a fundamental paper of Blame and Michali from the early 80s.
1353360	1359760	And here I invite Alina to unmute herself and join me.
1359760	1363480	It's OK, Alina.
1363480	1365640	Alina, are you there?
1365640	1366880	Yes, I'm here.
1366880	1368320	All right, yes.
1368320	1371920	Enthusiastic, as I can see.
1371960	1378200	OK, so yeah, I'm going to do an experiment.
1378200	1379240	We are trying to understand.
1379240	1386960	We said that the post-typical random event is a coin toss, half tails, half heads.
1386960	1392760	So suppose I'm holding a coin and I'm going to toss it in the air.
1393600	1405800	I'll toss a coin and, you know, you should guess just as it leaves my finger.
1405800	1415040	So maybe we assume we are in the same room, let's say, as in the picture you are watching me.
1415040	1420520	And, you know, maybe it spends two seconds in the air and you should guess just as it
1420520	1425560	leaves my finger whether it will be heads on tails when it lands on the floor.
1425560	1432280	OK, what do you think the probability that you'll predict it correctly will be?
1432280	1433960	Uh-huh.
1433960	1435040	Good.
1435040	1438520	I told you not to worry.
1438520	1442440	Good, OK, so I agree and I think most people will give this answer.
1442440	1445640	OK, OK, let me ask you another question.
1445640	1449640	Suppose, you know, you are holding a laptop.
1449640	1453360	In fact, I know you have a laptop that you are watching.
1453360	1454280	You can use it.
1454280	1462200	So, you know, as I currently my finger, you know, you can do whatever you want.
1462200	1467840	What do you think is the probability that you will predict it correctly?
1467840	1469560	Still, huh?
1469560	1472200	OK, we are in agreement.
1472200	1476280	And again, I think everybody will have the same view.
1476280	1479600	OK, and so now let's change it again.
1479600	1489720	And suppose I give you, you know, any number of video cameras that are trained on my fingers
1489720	1495480	and they are all connected to a great computer and a supercomputer and it is connected to
1495480	1501920	your laptop and they are all ready to go just as I toss the coin.
1501920	1508440	What do you think will be the chances that you predict the outcome correctly?
1508440	1510720	Well, depends how well positioned.
1510720	1513040	It is powerful as you want.
1513040	1516480	It gets, I guess, closer to one, right?
1516480	1521360	Yeah, well, I think the right person.
1521360	1523040	Thank you.
1523040	1526000	Yeah, so what's the point about this?
1526000	1534880	Again, I think that you can imagine that, you know, with sufficient machinery, one can
1534880	1541720	calculate, you know, the angular momentum of the coin and the, you know, the air pressure
1541720	1547240	and the humidity in the air and the distance to the floor with perfect accuracy so that
1547240	1552680	almost surely you'll get the right answer suddenly in far less than two seconds.
1552680	1555400	OK, so what is the point of this?
1555400	1562120	There is a major point which deviates from all previous views of randomness.
1562120	1573480	I want to stress that the experiment, me tossing the coin, the random event, suppose the random
1573480	1577080	event, the event anyway we are using, didn't change.
1577080	1578600	My behavior didn't change here.
1578600	1579600	I'm tossing the coin.
1579600	1581640	I'm the random generator.
1581640	1583480	I didn't change at all.
1583480	1584480	Right?
1584480	1585480	This is the point.
1585480	1593200	So what is happening is we are seeing a property of randomness that distinguishes between different
1593200	1597880	observers of the random phenomena, right?
1597880	1603600	Depends, you know, randomness somehow, I mean, the ability to predict how much entropy is
1603600	1610240	in the coin depends on the, maybe not the eye of the beholder, but the computational
1610240	1613640	power of the beholder, OK?
1613640	1623960	So this is very different than basically every prior point of view till the 80s.
1623960	1633040	It's an objective definition, sorry, unlike the previous objective definition of randomness.
1633040	1634240	This is a subjective one.
1634240	1641760	It depends on the observer and its operative, you know, we look at what the observer would
1641760	1647200	say or what's the probability that the observer will say something about what they see.
1647200	1654280	OK, so we are going to take now this, you know, point of view and going to study pseudo
1654280	1658880	randomness or notions, various notions of pseudo randomness because they too will depend
1658880	1664600	on observers or on properties of events that are being looked at.
1664600	1670160	So I'm switching now to the second part and if there's an important question or somebody
1670160	1682200	in the chat that Philip saw that is, you know, I need to answer now, I'm happy to.
1682200	1691360	So just repeat the message is that we are now considering randomness as a property of
1691360	1692360	the observer.
1692360	1698400	How much randomness, how much entropy or what is, what is, what we recall random depends
1698400	1701920	on observers or on properties of what we are seeing.
1701920	1705240	OK, so let me just start giving examples.
1705240	1713640	So now I'm moving to the second part and this is about pseudo randomness and this slide
1713640	1716920	is a bit abstract and then there will be many examples.
1716920	1722200	So don't worry if this is a bit abstract, but anyway, it should be appealing still.
1722200	1725360	We are looking now at deterministic structure.
1725360	1731320	So imagine that the universe of objects, these objects can be, you know, of any types
1731320	1739360	that can be numbers, graphs, sequences, tables, works, codes, lots of possibilities, but
1739360	1742120	discrete ones.
1742120	1752080	And in it, we want to understand what is the random like behavior or a typical behavior
1752200	1757320	and it will, I'll call it a property and the property will be just a subset of this
1757320	1761360	universe and the definition will be really simple.
1761360	1767600	A pseudo random property is any large property, any property, any subset that occupies most
1767600	1768840	of the universe.
1768840	1780200	So think of a hay in a, you know, in a haystack.
1780200	1792800	So a property that's held by most elements of the universe, equivalently, it's like
1792800	1798840	the hay in a haystack or, you know, another way to think about it is you should pick a
1798840	1802720	random element from you, it satisfies this property.
1802720	1806680	So this I will call and for the, you know, this example that will follow this will be
1806800	1812040	for me a pseudo random property.
1812040	1816720	I want to stress that both math and CS have lots of questions about pseudo randomness
1816720	1818320	and we'll see them.
1818320	1825480	The typical task, such question in mathematics is whether a particular object has a pseudo
1825480	1829920	random property, which is defined.
1829920	1835120	So we study, you know, there's random like properties of natural, this X zero, maybe
1835160	1840080	natural, we'll see examples in computer science is a different angle.
1840080	1850240	Mostly we look, you know, we want an algorithm to find any element of this with this property.
1850240	1856200	So basically we are looking for finding objects that have random like properties.
1856200	1858360	We know that most of them are like that.
1858360	1864080	So it's like sort of searching for hay in a haystack and, you know, as we'll see, I
1864120	1866600	mean, this is not an easy task.
1866600	1870960	Despite, you know, the popular culture, we are not looking for needles.
1870960	1873640	We are looking for hay.
1873640	1880640	OK, so let's see examples and, you know, we'll get familiar to my terminology here.
1880640	1887080	First, I want to say just why, you know, yeah, the popular culture does say that we
1887080	1889160	should easily find hay in haystack.
1889160	1893520	Why, why is this not true in the in the problems we are really interested in?
1893520	1898120	First of all, that, you know, we are talking about huge objects.
1898120	1903000	And typically we see very, very tiny parts of them.
1903000	1907520	So we may see closer to us, maybe needles.
1907520	1913160	And we also often tend to search, you know, sort of using the tools we have, but they
1913160	1914160	may not be sufficient.
1914160	1917400	I just want to give two sort of popular examples.
1917400	1925520	You know, we may look at this and say, oh, this is green everywhere, even though we know
1925520	1928880	most of it is red, but we have to cut it first.
1928880	1935080	And another example is that I like a lot is this issue of exoplanets.
1935080	1941560	I mean, for up to about 30 years ago, 25 years ago, I think people had no evidence
1941560	1949080	that other stars, which are, of course, suns in the universe have any planets.
1949080	1950360	There was no way to see them.
1950360	1953040	You need the particular new techniques.
1953040	1958800	So you could have predicted that, you know, no, no suns have planets, except maybe ours.
1958800	1960800	But it's not true.
1960800	1961800	Okay.
1961800	1966560	So sometimes, you know, we don't, we don't, these are huge objects and we may not have
1966560	1967560	the right tools.
1967560	1971560	So let's see, you know, more mathematical example.
1971560	1976560	Let me start with codes, because most people are familiar with them.
1976560	1981200	Of course, codes are extremely, air-correcting codes are extremely important to, you know,
1981200	1987120	lots of things we use in our daily lives and embedded in all of the storage and communication
1987120	1993920	devices are good air-correcting codes that they have, you know, large rates and distance
1993920	1994920	if you want.
1994920	2000000	You know, there's a formal definition of what a good code, what the properties of a good
2000000	2001000	code is.
2001000	2007280	But, you know, let's fix some such notion.
2007280	2015560	The basic result that Shannon, you know, opened the door for this amazing theory, coding theory,
2015560	2022400	was the, first of all, the observation that a random code is a good code.
2022400	2024160	Almost all codes are good codes.
2024160	2030160	I'm not defining formally the space and so on, but some of you know and some of you
2030160	2031160	can imagine.
2031160	2034400	But regardless, a random code is a good code.
2034400	2039120	And the first thing I want to take from this is to, you know, instill in you that, you
2039120	2045600	know, my notation, this, that means that good codes is a, being a good code is a pseudo
2045600	2046600	random property.
2046600	2047600	Why?
2047600	2050160	Because it's, you know, almost every code is good.
2050160	2051160	Okay.
2051160	2052480	That's one point.
2052480	2053680	And then what do you want to do?
2053680	2057800	If you want to put it in various devices, you need to be also useful.
2057800	2063560	You want to be able to describe it, decode and code it, decode it and so on.
2063560	2064800	And this is a hard problem.
2064800	2069800	I mean, that took, you know, some 20 years, then we are still looking for other, you know,
2069800	2076000	even better ones, but to find explicit codes, you know, efficiently usable codes, this,
2076000	2077480	this is a hard problem.
2077480	2085480	So this is an example of problem, you know, of finding an element of a pseudo random property.
2085480	2091640	Here's a very different element, a very different example, I'm sure you're all familiar with
2091640	2094800	this number.
2094800	2104040	So here is a, you know, a property that you would like maybe this random to satisfy or
2104040	2106760	is believed to be a property of pi.
2106760	2112960	If you look at the number of occurrences of the digits seven in the expansion of pi,
2112960	2117240	it looks like it appears about one tenth of the time.
2117240	2123640	If you look at any pair of digits, let's say five, four point 65, four occurs one hundredth
2123640	2125360	of the time.
2125360	2128560	If you look at any triple one thousandths of the time, et cetera.
2128560	2135200	So let's demand that let's say we are looking at real numbers, maybe between zero and one.
2135200	2141120	And we want all these properties, it's a countable number of properties, we want them
2141120	2143480	to hold about this real number.
2143480	2149160	And moreover, we want them to hold not only in base them, but in base seven, in base 15,
2149160	2156560	in base million and one and so on, still a countable countable number of properties.
2156560	2164120	And what do we know about this, these are called normal numbers, properties, number satisfying
2164120	2172040	all these properties are called normal and basically an observation that just because
2172040	2176760	are only countable in many conditions that the random real number, let's say between
2176760	2185680	real and between zero and one is normal with high probability except with probability zero.
2185680	2192840	So again, this means that normality is a pseudo random property, it is held by almost
2192840	2196880	every number in the universe repeat.
2196880	2203160	And mathematicians study this question is, you know, for example, particular natural
2203160	2208040	elements like pi like root two or whatever are normal.
2208040	2213040	And I should say this is, these problems are still open, maybe some of you are working
2213040	2215960	on them, I don't know.
2215960	2222080	Yeah, anyway, so the open problems in the, you know, that are formulated naturally formulated
2222080	2228120	in this language of randomness, give me, give me an object that looks like a random object
2228120	2232960	here in the pseudo random properties normality.
2232960	2241760	So this may be, you know, not a central examples in mathematics, but I want to say that the
2241760	2247000	problems that can be expressed in exactly this form, you know, is a natural object pseudo
2247000	2251640	random are absolutely fundamental in both math and computer science.
2251640	2259720	And I want to give you another example with you, you particularly will know number theories.
2259720	2269960	But in general, the major problems that concern or can be phrased questions about pseudo randomness.
2270920	2278120	Usually, if I have a room, talking to and can see people like us, young ones, you know,
2278120	2280120	what are major problems?
2280120	2283960	How do you know that the problem is major?
2283960	2291240	Well, one, one answer is that there's a lot of bounty money offered for it.
2291240	2298760	So here's one set of such problems, the clay millennium problems.
2298760	2306120	And one is gone, there's still other ways to make a million dollars.
2306120	2313160	What I want to say is that at least two of these problems are really naturally expressed as
2314120	2320680	questions about pseudo randomness, you know, our main problem, computer science, and maybe
2320680	2325960	your main problem, the Riemann hypothesis, I will not spend much time about this.
2325960	2332920	First one, give a sample, but say briefly, why is it a pseudo randomness question?
2332920	2334760	Well, what's the pseudo random property?
2336120	2338760	Being hard to compute is a pseudo random property.
2338760	2340840	Random functions are hard to compute.
2341480	2346280	And we ask whether a particular function, let's say the traveling settlement problem or
2348520	2354440	you know, solving, you know, quadratic systems of quadratic equations over finite fields,
2354440	2359320	your favorite, whether a particular problem, natural problem is also hard to compute.
2359320	2361480	That's basically the previous NP question.
2362360	2367720	So it's a question about pseudo randomness, whether a natural element has a pseudo random property.
2368440	2373800	And I want to talk about the second one, I'll elaborate on this, I don't need to read it,
2373800	2378840	but again, we'll see a pseudo random property and many of you, of course, will know this
2379800	2380280	result.
2380280	2386120	So let's express Riemann hypothesis as a pseudo random property of something.
2386120	2392280	And if something would be, you know, the universe would be a collection of walks.
2393080	2397160	So here's a canonical description of the drunkard walk.
2398200	2407960	You think that there is a pub in location zero in this street, if you want, and somebody walks
2408040	2414920	into it, and after a few beers come out and start walking up and down the streets, maybe a bit drunk.
2415560	2421640	So takes each step up with probability half and down with probability half.
2423240	2429560	And then you can, you know, just run an experiment just and toss random coins and see where
2430200	2432440	the person gets to after 100 steps.
2433160	2438520	And even if you didn't know math, you would observe immediately that something weird happens
2438520	2446200	that despite the fact that the person took, you know, 100 steps, he or she would be only
2446200	2449000	about 10 paces away from the pub.
2449960	2457400	So something happens, which we know, and of course, it's an exercise to prove that after
2457400	2462440	10 steps, almost surely, it was very high probability, the distance from the origin will
2462440	2464600	be about root 10 steps.
2465720	2473640	So it's an exercise, of course, and more important for me, it's something we see as pseudo random
2473640	2480200	property here, right? So the property of a walk staying close to the origin about root
2480200	2485640	10 from the origin is a pseudo random property because almost every walk has this property.
2486360	2492680	Okay, good. So now let's talk about the particular walk, which you all like, the Mabuse walk.
2494280	2500200	You know, so here's the definition, you know, for an integer p of x, you know, the number
2500200	2506200	of distinct prime divisors, and we just define mu of x, a Mabuse function.
2507400	2513160	It will be zero if the x is a square divisor and otherwise, you know, it's,
2513160	2515080	oops, there's a minus one hidden.
2516360	2518360	Yeah, so it's minus one if it's odd.
2519080	2523880	I wonder if I can fix this so that it will be visible.
2532680	2533960	Here is a minus.
2533960	2535480	Okay, sorry about that.
2536440	2545560	Okay, anyway, that's a Mabuse function and Mabuse function can think of it as describing a walk.
2545560	2552440	I mean, it just tells you for every time step, first step, second step, third step, what to do,
2552440	2557240	whether to go up the street or down the street. And let's suppose we allow also that sometimes you
2557240	2563000	stay where you are. So I'm changing a bit the definition of a walk, but that doesn't matter
2563000	2570600	much. And now, what are we wondering about is this particular walk is just a description of a
2570600	2576600	walk like before, but only it's deterministic, not random. And we ask whether it's, you know,
2577240	2582840	has it stood on the property? Does it stay close to the origin? And as, you know,
2583880	2589560	probably most of you in this audience know, that's basically the lima hypothesis, right?
2589960	2598760	If for every end this work says around the origin, then the lima hypothesis is true and vice
2598760	2605320	versa. So it's another formulation, a very convenient formulation, the one that you can tell
2605320	2612600	your, you know, your family and friends about without zeta functions about what the lima hypothesis
2612600	2621320	really is. So, but anyway, very conveniently stated as the pseudorandom is a question about
2621320	2630760	the particular pseudorandom. Okay, so these are basically the examples we see one more soon,
2630760	2638760	but I want to get now to the point I was talking about in the beginning. How does this
2638760	2646440	point of view, what did it lead us to understand about applications of randomness,
2646440	2649640	you know, to, especially to probabilistic algorithms and
2653320	2659960	some major results, both technically and conceptually understanding
2661320	2666200	some fundamental tools about the power and limitation of randomness,
2666200	2671960	at least in computational settings. Okay, and actually quite beyond, but I will probably not
2671960	2679880	have time to talk about this. Okay, so let me summarize this on one slide and I'll elaborate
2679880	2689080	a bit on one. So the three possible worlds I want to consider are the following. One is the
2690200	2694760	world in which we have perfect randomness in which we could, you know, do everything we want,
2694760	2702520	we just are guaranteed a stream of unbiased independent quantos. The second world is a world
2702520	2710840	that was maybe alluded to by some of the companies that use physical devices or physical phenomena
2710840	2719320	to create random bits or pseudorandom bits. This is a world where we have some unpredictable
2719320	2725400	phenomena, you can think of sunspots or stock market behavior or radioactive decay or quantum
2725400	2734440	phenomena, your favorite. In each of them, we feel there's some entropy, we feel there's some
2734440	2739240	unpredictability, if we want to know, you know, of course, there are not independent events,
2740280	2746120	if you want to know whether tomorrow it's probably a good guess to say that it will be like today.
2746120	2754200	So they're correlated and they are not sometimes biased and so on. Of course,
2754200	2760200	we can manipulate them and try to use them then in one of these applications. Anyway,
2760200	2767720	this is a world in which there's some entropy in the sequence we see, but it's not necessarily
2767720	2773800	independent unbiased, you know, uniform distribution. And the third world is, you know,
2773800	2779000	there's the other world is deterministic, there is no randomness at all, it's all in our imagination,
2779000	2785720	everything's predictable, what can we do then? We can just, everything's deterministic.
2786600	2791720	So, you know, we saw these applications in case we have perfect randomness,
2791720	2797960	this question, what survives otherwise? And in the next two boxes are really major,
2797960	2804520	these major understandings. So in the first, it turns out that all probabilistic algorithms
2805160	2812120	can be made to function as they did, even in the presence of very weak randomness.
2813160	2818520	This is the subject of what is called extractor theory, randomness extraction,
2819640	2826680	long, long sequence of works. And it is all about purifying randomness, taking, you know,
2826680	2832440	weak random sources, sources that are biased and dependent, and somehow extracting
2833720	2841400	audience or extracting anyway, their entropy in pure form, they may make to look maybe
2841400	2846200	shorter sequences, but they look like they were perfectly random. So that's one,
2847800	2853000	you know, one theory, one major result, sequence of results.
2853480	2861000	The second one is what happens if the world is deterministic. And in this case,
2861000	2866920	we just don't know how to move an inch without an assumption, but it's okay,
2866920	2873800	the assumption is something that we live with, and believe. So I want to assume,
2873800	2877000	I put it in quotes, because I don't want to formally define it,
2877880	2884600	well, you can ask me, but something like P is different than NP. You can
2885320	2894440	satisfy yourself, at least in that the whole electronic commerce world you live in assumes
2894440	2900120	far less than that. It's assumed that factoring or discrete logarithm or some other computational
2900120	2905320	problem in NP is difficult, it's exponentially difficult. And that's the nature of the assumption
2905320	2912680	that we need. Okay, so we assume something like there exists a house function. That's what we assume.
2912680	2920920	And now under this assumption, again, you know, we don't need randomness. All fast algorithms for
2920920	2925800	with for every practical purposes are all algorithms. Fast, I mean those we can run in our
2925800	2931320	lifetimes, all efficient algorithms that are probabilistic can be replaced,
2932280	2940440	to say every fast probabilistic algorithms has a deterministic counterpart. There's another
2940440	2947800	algorithm which is deterministic does exactly the same thing has no error. And it's not much slower
2947800	2954440	than the original. This is a consequence of another theory, which, you know, but sort of the paradigm
2954440	2959880	underlying it, underlying it is the hardness versus randomness paradigm, namely you can use
2960680	2966840	house function to generate good enough randomness deterministically. Again, long sequence of
2966840	2974680	works several decades spent and the consequences is this understanding. So in other words, it seems
2974680	2982920	like, you know, randomness for the purpose of algorithms is far weaker than may have been
2982920	2989640	suspected initially with their power or the seeming success in the absence of the deterministic
2989640	2997160	algorithms for lots of problems we want to solve. Okay. I want to say something about
2998840	3005480	doing with time. Just give a hint. Okay, good. I started the seven minutes late. So that's good.
3006360	3008280	Take five more minutes of your time.
3012120	3016600	I want to tell you something about this structural theory and randomness verification.
3017160	3024360	And yeah, we saw that perfect randomness has lots of applications. And supposedly in reality,
3024360	3033320	we have, you know, this sort of weak random sources is bias dependent sources. And I want
3033320	3039000	to assume for this, you know, this is only part of the story. I want to assume that
3042840	3048120	there are several of them, and they're independent of each other. So let's say we have three or five
3048120	3053960	or 10 such phenomena that we can tap, they're all weak, you know, they all contain maybe
3055400	3060040	an end bit sequence will contain only n over 100 bits of entropy or maybe square
3060120	3067080	with n of bits of entropy. But I have several of them. So I want to assume that, you know,
3067080	3073400	sunspots don't affect stock market behavior. Some people believe that it does actually,
3073400	3079400	but let's assume it's not. So I have several sources. And the question is, if I have such a,
3079400	3087400	you know, collection of outputs of such phenomena, can I transform it into maybe a
3087400	3093800	shorter sequence of something that looks, you know, exactly or almost exactly statistically
3093800	3099160	exactly like the uniform distribution. That's a subject of example theory. And I want to give
3099160	3105480	you a hint into one result that, you know, uses a pseudorandom property. So we'll connect the
3106360	3111960	two parts of the talk. So I want to talk about one more pseudorandom property,
3112920	3120520	you know, it's a property of tables of matrices of numbers. Okay, so think of a random
3121400	3125800	n by n matrix with entries in n. Think you're working more than
3127800	3134920	elements between one element. Okay, and what, when do I call, you know, what's the property I'm after?
3134920	3140120	The property is that if I look at any sub matrix, small sub matrix, okay,
3142040	3149160	then I see lots of numbers. So let's quantify this. Yeah, this is certainly that, you know,
3149160	3155640	what you will see in, you know, in such random examples. Every small window, which is a
3155640	3160200	some matrix, some matrix, I mean, in general, a subset of rows crosses a subset of columns.
3160920	3167320	Let's say, you know, if I pick a k by k window, the k rows and k columns, and I look at this k
3167320	3174040	squared entries, I see significantly more than k distinct entries. I mean, you would expect,
3174040	3179400	actually, it will be close to k squared if k is small enough. And k is small enough, k is maybe
3179400	3184680	n to the point one. So in a random table, you know, surely you will have this property for
3184680	3191640	every window. I want to stress, I want for every window. It's a sort of random property. It's an
3191640	3197720	easy theorem counting argument to prove that a random matrix will have this property.
3199480	3206520	And here's the question of the same nature. Can such matrices be constructed explicitly?
3207160	3213560	Is there, you know, just give me a matrix of numbers in one to n by n matrix where, of course,
3213560	3222440	a family of matrices so that every k by k window has at least k to the 1.1 distinct entries, say.
3224600	3233480	Okay, I mean, we mathematicians have lots of examples for the matrices we like that look
3233480	3239240	random in various ways. But I mean, let's start from, you know, every case could give you a matrix,
3239240	3245560	right? I mean, second grader can give you the addition table. So here's the, here's the matrix.
3245560	3251400	Let's say we wrap more than the numbers. I didn't do it here, but we wrap the numbers more than.
3253080	3258680	Is it good? Is this to do random in this sense? Does every small window have few entries? Well,
3258680	3265880	of course not. I mean, we've seen in, if we look along an arithmetic progression
3266760	3273080	in rows and columns, we will see just a linear number in k by k matrix will see just a linear
3273080	3280920	number of distinct entries. So it's certainly bad. Okay, well, we can go to third grade and think about
3280920	3289000	the multiplication table. And we can ask whether this is good. And of course, the answer is no
3289000	3296520	for the same reason if we look at this rectangle doesn't show it. But if you look at the geometric
3296520	3301800	progression, long rows and columns, again, you'll see only a linear number of entries.
3302520	3310600	And this somehow reminds me of a lesson that von Neumann was saying or attributed to von Neumann
3310600	3316440	that anyone who considers a mathematical method to produce random digits is of course in a state of
3316760	3323480	sin. But anybody who knows the history knows that von Neumann ignores his own advice and of course
3323480	3332440	use pseudo random generators based on mathematical means. And in fact, you should do it in this case
3332440	3336760	too. And what I'm going to say is the result that probably many of you are familiar with
3338680	3343880	is that while each of these tables, each of these matrices, the addition one, the multiplication
3343880	3352280	one is bad. Their combination is good. Starting with other similarity in the case of integers
3352280	3357080	and then we'll get passed out in the final field case, let's say more than or more p.
3358520	3365720	If you do it more the prime, then every window will be good in one of these tables. So if you
3365720	3371080	look at the union of numbers you see in the, you know, in the window above and window below,
3371080	3379160	there'll be plenty of entries as many as you need. So what does it mean in terms of, so first of all
3380200	3385640	we found, you know, by cheating a bit, by taking two tables, we found
3387400	3392680	elements that have this pseudo random property which are explicit. In fact, they are very simple
3392680	3399960	and easy to compute. And this was used in one of the early solutions to this problem of
3399960	3410040	extractor randomness. Basically, some and products are independent. That's the message from this
3410600	3417880	very important theorem and mixing them increases entropy. So one way to view this extractor
3420520	3427480	is that if you have three such sources, you can add the first two and multiply by the third,
3427480	3434840	you know, they think of them as integers more p. The entropy, total entropy will have increased.
3435400	3442760	The entropy rate will have increased and therefore you can repeat it several times and approach,
3443880	3451720	you know, perfect randomness. So that's one example of an extractor using this particular pseudo random
3451720	3457480	property of tables or methods. Okay, so let me summarize.
3460760	3467800	Some things we have seen, some important messages. I want to go back to this really important point
3467800	3472760	that, you know, randomness is in the eye of the beholder or in the computational power of the
3472760	3479640	beholder. This is a subjective definition and this very important point of view that leads to this
3480600	3490840	understanding. It's also pragmatic in the sense that you can study the use of randomness
3491880	3499640	or the intended use of randomness and maybe by understanding it you can remove the use of randomness
3499720	3510840	in it. And the impact of this kind of point of view is that you can remove randomness from
3510840	3518680	probabilistic algorithms even in situations where you have very weak random sources or even assuming
3518680	3525560	hardness in a world which is just purely deterministic. I should maybe add here that because
3525560	3532760	you are familiar with this example but may not be familiar with how related it is to the lecture.
3532760	3539640	So you all know that there is a deterministic polynomial time algorithm to certify prime
3539640	3548760	to determine whether a number and integer is prime or not. You also probably know that there
3548760	3552760	are lots of probabilistic algorithms for this before the deterministic one was known and of
3552760	3560680	course a question of doing this sufficiently is extremely odd. Gauss talks about it quite explicitly
3562040	3568280	and well Granville has a beautiful survey in which he sites in the beginning this except from
3568920	3578120	Gauss's discussion on this arithmetic where he basically calls to the community basically says
3578120	3584520	it's a disgrace we don't yet have an efficient algorithm for either primality or factoring.
3585320	3592600	Anyway the way what was I think less people know is that the way that the deterministic
3593400	3600680	algorithm was obtained by Agarwal Kayal and Saxena was the following. They've designed
3601560	3608840	a new probabilistic algorithm for primality testing and then in fact this was earlier work of
3610680	3621800	Agarwal and another student and the work of Agarwal Kayal and Saxena is a
3621800	3626040	de-randomization of this algorithm. It's a way of understanding the way the algorithm
3626040	3632920	used this randomness and constructing a specific pseudorandom generator which fools it and therefore
3632920	3641400	makes it deterministic. Okay so anyway there are many other probabilistic algorithms for which we
3641400	3651640	know it only under some assumptions like p different. Next pseudorandomness so what was used is the
3652600	3661560	general very high level definition of pseudorandomness which connects basically like
3661560	3667240	in the example of primality connects the property the pseudorandom property with the
3667240	3673880	application in mind maybe the algorithm you want to the randomness. The study of pseudorandomness
3673880	3680280	captures many basic problems and areas both in math and in computer science. I could have
3680280	3684920	talked another hour on you know structural versus randomness paradigm which is very much
3684920	3697480	part of a pseudorandomness study. It captures things like this name I think was given by Tao gave
3697480	3703640	surveys of examples like this and you know many like some other regularity lemma or it's used
3703640	3709240	in high math progressions in the primes it's used in boosting and machine learning and it's used
3709240	3716600	basically in the other applications of it in analysis and PDEs and you know that's
3717720	3728520	definitely in number theory and yeah so it stems from a very
3729480	3736440	you know pseudorandomness like approach to a very wide array of problems.
3737160	3742680	And the last thing is that pseudorandom objects that you you build for particular purposes in
3742680	3749960	particular you know extractor for extractor theory or expander graphs or various codes or something
3750280	3757640	turn out to actually they were initially designed for fault tolerant circuits
3758840	3761960	or that's at least what Pinsker has in mind as an application.
3764600	3771240	Often they find many many many more applications than they used to there they somehow fundamental
3771240	3778760	turn out many of them are fundamental in other contexts than you know I think you must have
3778760	3785000	heard of is high dimensional expander another example of a pseudorandom object of a mysterious
3785000	3791160	nature that we are trying to understand and yeah there are many more so let me end with this thank you.
