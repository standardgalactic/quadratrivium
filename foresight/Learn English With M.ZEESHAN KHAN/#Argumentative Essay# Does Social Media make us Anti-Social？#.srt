1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:16,040
Okay, dear, so in this lecture we are going to talk about an argumentative essay.

2
00:00:16,040 --> 00:00:17,040
Fine.

3
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:25,840
The title of the essay there is Does Social Media Make Us Anti-Social?

4
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:29,440
Does Social Media Make Us Anti-Social?

5
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:32,320
So look at the favorite topic.

6
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:38,200
From the beginning of the topic, you come to know whether I shall go for the topic

7
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:40,920
or I shall go against the topic.

8
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:46,560
Look at the favorite topic and every argumentative topic you will have two sides, either to go

9
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:52,240
for the topic or to go against the topic, fine?

10
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:58,120
So argumentative topics are easy to understand because those are not expository topics, okay?

11
00:00:58,120 --> 00:01:03,560
Expository topics, the things are not in a question type but in the argumentative essay,

12
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:09,480
the topic will almost like be a question type, whether to go for the topic or to go against

13
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:14,600
the topic and most of the time it will be in a form of a question.

14
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:19,480
So now look at it like, Does Social Media Make Us Anti-Social?

15
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:25,720
No, it's your choice whether to say yes, Social Media Make Us Anti-Social or whether to say

16
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:32,480
no, Social Media Does Not Make Us Anti-Social, that is your choice now, okay?

17
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:40,840
Okay, it's an argumentative essay based on reasoning, facts and point of views, okay?

18
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:48,360
Expository essays are based on only facts but argumentative essays are based on reasoning,

19
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:49,840
facts and point of views.

20
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:54,760
You will have to go for logical reasoning, you will have to put the facts and you will

21
00:01:54,760 --> 00:02:02,960
have to your own point of view while writing the essay, the argumentative essay, fine?

22
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:10,040
The important note for an argumentative essay, that is one can go for or against the topic

23
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:13,120
in an argumentative essay, okay?

24
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:17,880
One can go for or against the topic in an argumentative essay, you are not bound to

25
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:22,560
whether to go for the topic or go against the topic, that is your choice, which side

26
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:26,400
you can defend, you have to go for that, okay?

27
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:32,040
It depends on your defense, which side you can defend, fine?

28
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:38,240
You have to go for that, whether you can defend the topic or you can go against the topic,

29
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:39,560
that is your wish, okay?

30
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:44,320
Or you can go for both the topic as well as against the topic, okay?

31
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:52,160
Whether you go for or against the topic or you can discuss both of the sides, like you

32
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:56,240
can go for the topic, you can also go against the topic at a time, fine?

33
00:02:56,240 --> 00:03:01,800
You cannot, like you can have your own point of view, fine?

34
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:05,480
Outline on the essay, that is introduction, okay?

35
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:08,720
The first sentence of the introduction, look at it.

36
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:13,960
Social media make us antisocial because it affects our familial relations, okay?

37
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:18,520
Why social media make us antisocial because it affects our familial relation?

38
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:21,120
How it affects our familial relation?

39
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:26,840
Because living in one family, the family members have less time for each other, they are just

40
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:29,320
using social media.

41
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:34,280
The son will have no time to meet his parents, his mother in the next room or his sister

42
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:36,040
to sit with them, okay?

43
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:40,080
He will have only time for, or she will have only time for social media.

44
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:45,960
He or she will be busy in social media, like the Instagram, the Snapchat, the Facebook,

45
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:50,040
the social media messenger and the WhatsApp and all these things.

46
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:52,720
And he will have no time to sit with the family.

47
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:56,320
So it affects the familial relation, fine?

48
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:59,680
The next point is, it makes people socially neglected.

49
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:02,760
Yes, it makes people socially neglected.

50
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:08,000
How it makes people, how it makes people socially neglected?

51
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:12,640
Because people will have no time to come out to the society and meet their neighbors and

52
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:15,320
the members of the society.

53
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:17,200
So they are socially neglected.

54
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:21,560
People don't think that they are a part of the society because they are not seen outside

55
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:27,240
in the society and only, they are not seen in the gathering, the public gathering and

56
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:29,360
the social gathering of the society.

57
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:34,680
They have their own world inside their home, inside their room and even inside their bed.

58
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:42,000
Like they will have no contact with his, with his or her siblings, like sleeping or sitting

59
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,840
around him in one room.

60
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:48,480
Like he will have no time for, even for them to talk to him, he will be so much, or she

61
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:52,720
will be so much busy in the social media, fine?

62
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:55,400
Social media is devoid of face to face contact.

63
00:04:55,400 --> 00:05:02,080
It is devoid of face to face contact, like we will have no face to face contact with

64
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:03,080
the people.

65
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:07,400
Like you will be just chatting with them, you will be just reading the repost, you will

66
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:12,960
be just commenting over, there is a tie up, like it is not even, it is no, no, no room

67
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:15,920
for face to face contact in the social media.

68
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:20,800
Like people will just read your post, or you will read the post, or you will have only

69
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:23,800
comment on that, like on that, okay?

70
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:29,440
Or you will have to share the post, or you will have to, to read to the story, like these

71
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:30,440
are the things, fine?

72
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:35,840
Or you will read the, you will read someone's status and you will comment on that, okay?

73
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:40,240
It's such thing, it is no face to face contact.

74
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:47,040
The next point is it increases vanity and self-adulation, it increases vanity and self-adulation.

75
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:54,000
People are like, they go for that, like they have no room even to escape all these things,

76
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,160
fine?

77
00:05:55,160 --> 00:06:00,960
It is a world of isolation which demands complete isolation from rest of the world, okay?

78
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:04,080
Social media is a world of isolation, okay?

79
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:08,880
Which demands complete isolation from rest of the world.

80
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:12,760
It's a separate world, it's a separate world of segregation.

81
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:18,240
People are segregated, people are isolated, like they are isolated in the midst of the

82
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:27,560
heavy and crowded societies, like one person will be, one person will have a lot of social,

83
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:33,360
a lot of family members, or he will have a lot of friends, and he will have many things,

84
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:36,920
but he will, he won't be able to meet them and to come out of his home, like he will

85
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:42,880
be isolated in his room, in his home, okay?

86
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:44,880
That is a different world, okay?

87
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:50,520
People are isolated on social media, yes, they will have a lot of friends from around

88
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:55,600
the world, but they won't be able to meet them or talk to them, that is just an isolation,

89
00:06:55,600 --> 00:07:02,680
that is, you know, a company doesn't mean only messaging and only texting, a company

90
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:09,120
means being sitting together, talking together, like drinking together, and walking together,

91
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:15,200
it doesn't mean that only texting is enough, so it's a separate world, isolated, people

92
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:21,280
are isolated from the rest of the world, they have their own world, fine?

93
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:26,960
The next point is, it creates uncertainty and unpredictability, people are like, it creates

94
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:32,440
uncertainty and unpredictability, it creates unpredictability, things become unpredictable,

95
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:36,520
you cannot predict anything, like you will be predicting something, you will say it will

96
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:45,400
have something, yes, many of the boys, like they will have friends, they will have a friend

97
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:51,480
request or friends, like the account will be the name of a girl or something like that,

98
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:56,920
but in reality that will be something else, okay, that is unpredictable, you cannot predict

99
00:07:56,920 --> 00:08:01,440
that this person is a girl or this person is a boy, okay, that is unpredictable and

100
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:07,720
uncertain, because many of the boys are using girls' accounts these days and girls also

101
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:13,800
use boys' accounts for some purposes, so it is unpredictable, like, okay, and some people

102
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:20,120
like the anti-stat actors, like the violators, they also use certain type of IDs, you cannot

103
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:26,720
predict that he's a traitor or he's a patriot, fine, and that he's working for the country

104
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:31,400
or against it, you cannot predict anyone, so there is no predictability, there is no,

105
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:37,160
like, no, no, no, no certainty, things are not certain and things are not predictable

106
00:08:37,160 --> 00:08:42,320
on social media, you cannot say something about anything on the social media, okay, it

107
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:55,840
is like that, social media has psychological implications, social media has psychological

108
00:08:56,440 --> 00:09:04,640
implication, people are, the social media users, they are psychologically, like, they

109
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:10,680
have psychologically been converted and been, like, attracted to the social media, they

110
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:15,120
have psychological implication, they will not be feeling physically and mentally good

111
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:20,480
when they are using social media a lot, okay, because they forget the real world and then

112
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:25,760
they start living in the world of social media, they have no clue of the real world, then

113
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:29,920
they think in these social media, they didn't drink and they eat and all the things, when

114
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:34,800
they do these, they think about the social media, also have a psychological implication

115
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:41,040
as well, because the real world is an active world, this is not the world of commenting

116
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:45,960
and liking and messaging and texting, it's a real world, fine, so it has psychological

117
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:53,520
implications, it has shaken the foundation of the nature of its old tradition and norms,

118
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:58,240
fine, it has shaken the foundation of the centuries old traditions and norms, how?

119
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:06,640
Long ago, like, previously people used to visit one another, to visit the homes and talk and

120
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:11,760
have gossips and all these things, but these people don't visit each other, okay, there is

121
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:17,040
a traditional norm, people don't visit each other, when it would be eat, previously people would go

122
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:22,320
and they would impress each other and they would wish to eat, greet each other, but these

123
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:29,680
are not the case, only texts are only commented on a post, happy eat to everybody and friends

124
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:33,520
would come and they, friends will come and they will comment on the post, happy eat to you,

125
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:38,880
and that is, that is not, you know that is the thing these days, people don't visit physically

126
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:44,320
each other, like to, for wishing they happy eat, only commenting and only texting, that is enough,

127
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:50,240
and because, because that has challenged the old tradition and norms of the society, fine,

128
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:58,160
people used to, people used to, like, to, to visit the, the, the, the, the, the, the I'lling person,

129
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:02,800
to visit the L person, the sick person, but these days they will only comment, get well soon,

130
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:09,360
get well soon, that is, they don't visit, I had seen your status, you are, El and I commented on

131
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:14,720
that, okay fine, not, see this is not the thing, fine, someone will get married these days and he

132
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:18,560
will post on the social media and people will come, congratulations, congratulations and

133
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:24,640
and congratulation no one will go to his or her home for for wishing him or her the engagement

134
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:29,040
ceremony or the wedding ceremony so that is that is the thing these are the things fine

135
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:37,440
it creates vulnerabilities yes it creates vulnerabilities you know people are

136
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:46,320
the the the the the information and the secrecy are vulnerable these things can be easily traced

137
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:57,920
okay the the the uh ids and the secrecy these are not safe okay the information these things are

138
00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:04,880
not safe on social media these can be be traced by some hackers and all the people and they can

139
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:10,960
be used for illegal purposes you know vulnerabilities mean the things when things are vulnerable it

140
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:17,600
mean the things are easily to be reached to fine and affected by so this is all about the

141
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:26,000
social media social media is a kind of addiction yes it's a kind of addiction people are addicted

142
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:31,360
to social media social means like the word save the snap the instagram the messenger the phall but

143
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:37,280
when they don't use this that they feel a kind of like they feel a kind of pain they feel a kind of

144
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:45,600
like restlessness restlessness they feel restless when they don't use the social media

145
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:49,920
suppose you might have seen an addicted person everywhere he will go he will must open the

146
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:54,400
facebook app and to check whether someone has texted me someone has posted and like that

147
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:58,880
he will check or she will check the word save also the messenger the insta the snap check in

148
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:03,600
order to see i don't think he will be thinking or she will be thinking in his or her mind that

149
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:09,200
someone might have texted me so that is a kind of addiction okay people are addicted to social

150
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:16,160
media like they cannot live without the social media they must use the social media they will

151
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:21,520
have no money for the the rest of the thing but they will have the money for going to to have

152
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:27,280
activated an internet package in order to see whether someone has texted me or like that fine

153
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:33,840
so it is a time of you know it is an addiction social media is an addiction conclusion so

154
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:40,240
in the conclusion we would say that social media it make us an anti-social like it
