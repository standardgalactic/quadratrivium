0	16040	Okay, dear, so in this lecture we are going to talk about an argumentative essay.
16040	17040	Fine.
17040	25840	The title of the essay there is Does Social Media Make Us Anti-Social?
25840	29440	Does Social Media Make Us Anti-Social?
29440	32320	So look at the favorite topic.
32320	38200	From the beginning of the topic, you come to know whether I shall go for the topic
38200	40920	or I shall go against the topic.
40920	46560	Look at the favorite topic and every argumentative topic you will have two sides, either to go
46560	52240	for the topic or to go against the topic, fine?
52240	58120	So argumentative topics are easy to understand because those are not expository topics, okay?
58120	63560	Expository topics, the things are not in a question type but in the argumentative essay,
63560	69480	the topic will almost like be a question type, whether to go for the topic or to go against
69480	74600	the topic and most of the time it will be in a form of a question.
74600	79480	So now look at it like, Does Social Media Make Us Anti-Social?
79480	85720	No, it's your choice whether to say yes, Social Media Make Us Anti-Social or whether to say
85720	92480	no, Social Media Does Not Make Us Anti-Social, that is your choice now, okay?
92480	100840	Okay, it's an argumentative essay based on reasoning, facts and point of views, okay?
100840	108360	Expository essays are based on only facts but argumentative essays are based on reasoning,
108360	109840	facts and point of views.
109840	114760	You will have to go for logical reasoning, you will have to put the facts and you will
114760	122960	have to your own point of view while writing the essay, the argumentative essay, fine?
122960	130040	The important note for an argumentative essay, that is one can go for or against the topic
130040	133120	in an argumentative essay, okay?
133120	137880	One can go for or against the topic in an argumentative essay, you are not bound to
137880	142560	whether to go for the topic or go against the topic, that is your choice, which side
142560	146400	you can defend, you have to go for that, okay?
146400	152040	It depends on your defense, which side you can defend, fine?
152040	158240	You have to go for that, whether you can defend the topic or you can go against the topic,
158240	159560	that is your wish, okay?
159560	164320	Or you can go for both the topic as well as against the topic, okay?
164320	172160	Whether you go for or against the topic or you can discuss both of the sides, like you
172160	176240	can go for the topic, you can also go against the topic at a time, fine?
176240	181800	You cannot, like you can have your own point of view, fine?
181800	185480	Outline on the essay, that is introduction, okay?
185480	188720	The first sentence of the introduction, look at it.
188720	193960	Social media make us antisocial because it affects our familial relations, okay?
193960	198520	Why social media make us antisocial because it affects our familial relation?
198520	201120	How it affects our familial relation?
201120	206840	Because living in one family, the family members have less time for each other, they are just
206840	209320	using social media.
209320	214280	The son will have no time to meet his parents, his mother in the next room or his sister
214280	216040	to sit with them, okay?
216040	220080	He will have only time for, or she will have only time for social media.
220080	225960	He or she will be busy in social media, like the Instagram, the Snapchat, the Facebook,
225960	230040	the social media messenger and the WhatsApp and all these things.
230040	232720	And he will have no time to sit with the family.
232720	236320	So it affects the familial relation, fine?
236320	239680	The next point is, it makes people socially neglected.
239680	242760	Yes, it makes people socially neglected.
242760	248000	How it makes people, how it makes people socially neglected?
248000	252640	Because people will have no time to come out to the society and meet their neighbors and
252640	255320	the members of the society.
255320	257200	So they are socially neglected.
257200	261560	People don't think that they are a part of the society because they are not seen outside
261560	267240	in the society and only, they are not seen in the gathering, the public gathering and
267240	269360	the social gathering of the society.
269360	274680	They have their own world inside their home, inside their room and even inside their bed.
274680	282000	Like they will have no contact with his, with his or her siblings, like sleeping or sitting
282000	284840	around him in one room.
284840	288480	Like he will have no time for, even for them to talk to him, he will be so much, or she
288480	292720	will be so much busy in the social media, fine?
292720	295400	Social media is devoid of face to face contact.
295400	302080	It is devoid of face to face contact, like we will have no face to face contact with
302080	303080	the people.
303080	307400	Like you will be just chatting with them, you will be just reading the repost, you will
307400	312960	be just commenting over, there is a tie up, like it is not even, it is no, no, no room
312960	315920	for face to face contact in the social media.
315920	320800	Like people will just read your post, or you will read the post, or you will have only
320800	323800	comment on that, like on that, okay?
323800	329440	Or you will have to share the post, or you will have to, to read to the story, like these
329440	330440	are the things, fine?
330440	335840	Or you will read the, you will read someone's status and you will comment on that, okay?
335840	340240	It's such thing, it is no face to face contact.
340240	347040	The next point is it increases vanity and self-adulation, it increases vanity and self-adulation.
347040	354000	People are like, they go for that, like they have no room even to escape all these things,
354000	355160	fine?
355160	360960	It is a world of isolation which demands complete isolation from rest of the world, okay?
360960	364080	Social media is a world of isolation, okay?
364080	368880	Which demands complete isolation from rest of the world.
368880	372760	It's a separate world, it's a separate world of segregation.
372760	378240	People are segregated, people are isolated, like they are isolated in the midst of the
378240	387560	heavy and crowded societies, like one person will be, one person will have a lot of social,
387560	393360	a lot of family members, or he will have a lot of friends, and he will have many things,
393360	396920	but he will, he won't be able to meet them and to come out of his home, like he will
396920	402880	be isolated in his room, in his home, okay?
402880	404880	That is a different world, okay?
404880	410520	People are isolated on social media, yes, they will have a lot of friends from around
410520	415600	the world, but they won't be able to meet them or talk to them, that is just an isolation,
415600	422680	that is, you know, a company doesn't mean only messaging and only texting, a company
422680	429120	means being sitting together, talking together, like drinking together, and walking together,
429120	435200	it doesn't mean that only texting is enough, so it's a separate world, isolated, people
435200	441280	are isolated from the rest of the world, they have their own world, fine?
441280	446960	The next point is, it creates uncertainty and unpredictability, people are like, it creates
446960	452440	uncertainty and unpredictability, it creates unpredictability, things become unpredictable,
452440	456520	you cannot predict anything, like you will be predicting something, you will say it will
456520	465400	have something, yes, many of the boys, like they will have friends, they will have a friend
465400	471480	request or friends, like the account will be the name of a girl or something like that,
471480	476920	but in reality that will be something else, okay, that is unpredictable, you cannot predict
476920	481440	that this person is a girl or this person is a boy, okay, that is unpredictable and
481440	487720	uncertain, because many of the boys are using girls' accounts these days and girls also
487720	493800	use boys' accounts for some purposes, so it is unpredictable, like, okay, and some people
493800	500120	like the anti-stat actors, like the violators, they also use certain type of IDs, you cannot
500120	506720	predict that he's a traitor or he's a patriot, fine, and that he's working for the country
506720	511400	or against it, you cannot predict anyone, so there is no predictability, there is no,
511400	517160	like, no, no, no, no certainty, things are not certain and things are not predictable
517160	522320	on social media, you cannot say something about anything on the social media, okay, it
522320	535840	is like that, social media has psychological implications, social media has psychological
536440	544640	implication, people are, the social media users, they are psychologically, like, they
544640	550680	have psychologically been converted and been, like, attracted to the social media, they
550680	555120	have psychological implication, they will not be feeling physically and mentally good
555120	560480	when they are using social media a lot, okay, because they forget the real world and then
560480	565760	they start living in the world of social media, they have no clue of the real world, then
565920	569920	they think in these social media, they didn't drink and they eat and all the things, when
569920	574800	they do these, they think about the social media, also have a psychological implication
574800	581040	as well, because the real world is an active world, this is not the world of commenting
581040	585960	and liking and messaging and texting, it's a real world, fine, so it has psychological
585960	593520	implications, it has shaken the foundation of the nature of its old tradition and norms,
593680	598240	fine, it has shaken the foundation of the centuries old traditions and norms, how?
600000	606640	Long ago, like, previously people used to visit one another, to visit the homes and talk and
607200	611760	have gossips and all these things, but these people don't visit each other, okay, there is
611760	617040	a traditional norm, people don't visit each other, when it would be eat, previously people would go
617040	622320	and they would impress each other and they would wish to eat, greet each other, but these
622560	629680	are not the case, only texts are only commented on a post, happy eat to everybody and friends
629680	633520	would come and they, friends will come and they will comment on the post, happy eat to you,
633520	638880	and that is, that is not, you know that is the thing these days, people don't visit physically
638880	644320	each other, like to, for wishing they happy eat, only commenting and only texting, that is enough,
644320	650240	and because, because that has challenged the old tradition and norms of the society, fine,
651200	658160	people used to, people used to, like, to, to visit the, the, the, the, the, the, the I'lling person,
658160	662800	to visit the L person, the sick person, but these days they will only comment, get well soon,
662800	669360	get well soon, that is, they don't visit, I had seen your status, you are, El and I commented on
669360	674720	that, okay fine, not, see this is not the thing, fine, someone will get married these days and he
674720	678560	will post on the social media and people will come, congratulations, congratulations and
678560	684640	and congratulation no one will go to his or her home for for wishing him or her the engagement
684640	689040	ceremony or the wedding ceremony so that is that is the thing these are the things fine
692160	697440	it creates vulnerabilities yes it creates vulnerabilities you know people are
699200	706320	the the the the the information and the secrecy are vulnerable these things can be easily traced
706320	717920	okay the the the uh ids and the secrecy these are not safe okay the information these things are
717920	724880	not safe on social media these can be be traced by some hackers and all the people and they can
724880	730960	be used for illegal purposes you know vulnerabilities mean the things when things are vulnerable it
730960	737600	mean the things are easily to be reached to fine and affected by so this is all about the
738640	746000	social media social media is a kind of addiction yes it's a kind of addiction people are addicted
746000	751360	to social media social means like the word save the snap the instagram the messenger the phall but
751360	757280	when they don't use this that they feel a kind of like they feel a kind of pain they feel a kind of
758240	765600	like restlessness restlessness they feel restless when they don't use the social media
765600	769920	suppose you might have seen an addicted person everywhere he will go he will must open the
769920	774400	facebook app and to check whether someone has texted me someone has posted and like that
774400	778880	he will check or she will check the word save also the messenger the insta the snap check in
778880	783600	order to see i don't think he will be thinking or she will be thinking in his or her mind that
783600	789200	someone might have texted me so that is a kind of addiction okay people are addicted to social
789200	796160	media like they cannot live without the social media they must use the social media they will
796160	801520	have no money for the the rest of the thing but they will have the money for going to to have
801520	807280	activated an internet package in order to see whether someone has texted me or like that fine
807280	813840	so it is a time of you know it is an addiction social media is an addiction conclusion so
815280	820240	in the conclusion we would say that social media it make us an anti-social like it
821520	826640	it do all these things with us but in order to skip the addiction one should not be too much
827600	834240	too much the too much related or too much attracted toward the social media because
834240	842880	it has some positive and negative implications both thank you for watching us and hope you might
842880	846080	have understood the argumentative essay stay with us
