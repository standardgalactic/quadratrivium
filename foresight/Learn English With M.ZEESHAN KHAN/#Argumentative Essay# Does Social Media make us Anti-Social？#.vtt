00:00.000 --> 00:16.040
Okay, dear, so in this lecture we are going to talk about an argumentative essay.

00:16.040 --> 00:17.040
Fine.

00:17.040 --> 00:25.840
The title of the essay there is Does Social Media Make Us Anti-Social?

00:25.840 --> 00:29.440
Does Social Media Make Us Anti-Social?

00:29.440 --> 00:32.320
So look at the favorite topic.

00:32.320 --> 00:38.200
From the beginning of the topic, you come to know whether I shall go for the topic

00:38.200 --> 00:40.920
or I shall go against the topic.

00:40.920 --> 00:46.560
Look at the favorite topic and every argumentative topic you will have two sides, either to go

00:46.560 --> 00:52.240
for the topic or to go against the topic, fine?

00:52.240 --> 00:58.120
So argumentative topics are easy to understand because those are not expository topics, okay?

00:58.120 --> 01:03.560
Expository topics, the things are not in a question type but in the argumentative essay,

01:03.560 --> 01:09.480
the topic will almost like be a question type, whether to go for the topic or to go against

01:09.480 --> 01:14.600
the topic and most of the time it will be in a form of a question.

01:14.600 --> 01:19.480
So now look at it like, Does Social Media Make Us Anti-Social?

01:19.480 --> 01:25.720
No, it's your choice whether to say yes, Social Media Make Us Anti-Social or whether to say

01:25.720 --> 01:32.480
no, Social Media Does Not Make Us Anti-Social, that is your choice now, okay?

01:32.480 --> 01:40.840
Okay, it's an argumentative essay based on reasoning, facts and point of views, okay?

01:40.840 --> 01:48.360
Expository essays are based on only facts but argumentative essays are based on reasoning,

01:48.360 --> 01:49.840
facts and point of views.

01:49.840 --> 01:54.760
You will have to go for logical reasoning, you will have to put the facts and you will

01:54.760 --> 02:02.960
have to your own point of view while writing the essay, the argumentative essay, fine?

02:02.960 --> 02:10.040
The important note for an argumentative essay, that is one can go for or against the topic

02:10.040 --> 02:13.120
in an argumentative essay, okay?

02:13.120 --> 02:17.880
One can go for or against the topic in an argumentative essay, you are not bound to

02:17.880 --> 02:22.560
whether to go for the topic or go against the topic, that is your choice, which side

02:22.560 --> 02:26.400
you can defend, you have to go for that, okay?

02:26.400 --> 02:32.040
It depends on your defense, which side you can defend, fine?

02:32.040 --> 02:38.240
You have to go for that, whether you can defend the topic or you can go against the topic,

02:38.240 --> 02:39.560
that is your wish, okay?

02:39.560 --> 02:44.320
Or you can go for both the topic as well as against the topic, okay?

02:44.320 --> 02:52.160
Whether you go for or against the topic or you can discuss both of the sides, like you

02:52.160 --> 02:56.240
can go for the topic, you can also go against the topic at a time, fine?

02:56.240 --> 03:01.800
You cannot, like you can have your own point of view, fine?

03:01.800 --> 03:05.480
Outline on the essay, that is introduction, okay?

03:05.480 --> 03:08.720
The first sentence of the introduction, look at it.

03:08.720 --> 03:13.960
Social media make us antisocial because it affects our familial relations, okay?

03:13.960 --> 03:18.520
Why social media make us antisocial because it affects our familial relation?

03:18.520 --> 03:21.120
How it affects our familial relation?

03:21.120 --> 03:26.840
Because living in one family, the family members have less time for each other, they are just

03:26.840 --> 03:29.320
using social media.

03:29.320 --> 03:34.280
The son will have no time to meet his parents, his mother in the next room or his sister

03:34.280 --> 03:36.040
to sit with them, okay?

03:36.040 --> 03:40.080
He will have only time for, or she will have only time for social media.

03:40.080 --> 03:45.960
He or she will be busy in social media, like the Instagram, the Snapchat, the Facebook,

03:45.960 --> 03:50.040
the social media messenger and the WhatsApp and all these things.

03:50.040 --> 03:52.720
And he will have no time to sit with the family.

03:52.720 --> 03:56.320
So it affects the familial relation, fine?

03:56.320 --> 03:59.680
The next point is, it makes people socially neglected.

03:59.680 --> 04:02.760
Yes, it makes people socially neglected.

04:02.760 --> 04:08.000
How it makes people, how it makes people socially neglected?

04:08.000 --> 04:12.640
Because people will have no time to come out to the society and meet their neighbors and

04:12.640 --> 04:15.320
the members of the society.

04:15.320 --> 04:17.200
So they are socially neglected.

04:17.200 --> 04:21.560
People don't think that they are a part of the society because they are not seen outside

04:21.560 --> 04:27.240
in the society and only, they are not seen in the gathering, the public gathering and

04:27.240 --> 04:29.360
the social gathering of the society.

04:29.360 --> 04:34.680
They have their own world inside their home, inside their room and even inside their bed.

04:34.680 --> 04:42.000
Like they will have no contact with his, with his or her siblings, like sleeping or sitting

04:42.000 --> 04:44.840
around him in one room.

04:44.840 --> 04:48.480
Like he will have no time for, even for them to talk to him, he will be so much, or she

04:48.480 --> 04:52.720
will be so much busy in the social media, fine?

04:52.720 --> 04:55.400
Social media is devoid of face to face contact.

04:55.400 --> 05:02.080
It is devoid of face to face contact, like we will have no face to face contact with

05:02.080 --> 05:03.080
the people.

05:03.080 --> 05:07.400
Like you will be just chatting with them, you will be just reading the repost, you will

05:07.400 --> 05:12.960
be just commenting over, there is a tie up, like it is not even, it is no, no, no room

05:12.960 --> 05:15.920
for face to face contact in the social media.

05:15.920 --> 05:20.800
Like people will just read your post, or you will read the post, or you will have only

05:20.800 --> 05:23.800
comment on that, like on that, okay?

05:23.800 --> 05:29.440
Or you will have to share the post, or you will have to, to read to the story, like these

05:29.440 --> 05:30.440
are the things, fine?

05:30.440 --> 05:35.840
Or you will read the, you will read someone's status and you will comment on that, okay?

05:35.840 --> 05:40.240
It's such thing, it is no face to face contact.

05:40.240 --> 05:47.040
The next point is it increases vanity and self-adulation, it increases vanity and self-adulation.

05:47.040 --> 05:54.000
People are like, they go for that, like they have no room even to escape all these things,

05:54.000 --> 05:55.160
fine?

05:55.160 --> 06:00.960
It is a world of isolation which demands complete isolation from rest of the world, okay?

06:00.960 --> 06:04.080
Social media is a world of isolation, okay?

06:04.080 --> 06:08.880
Which demands complete isolation from rest of the world.

06:08.880 --> 06:12.760
It's a separate world, it's a separate world of segregation.

06:12.760 --> 06:18.240
People are segregated, people are isolated, like they are isolated in the midst of the

06:18.240 --> 06:27.560
heavy and crowded societies, like one person will be, one person will have a lot of social,

06:27.560 --> 06:33.360
a lot of family members, or he will have a lot of friends, and he will have many things,

06:33.360 --> 06:36.920
but he will, he won't be able to meet them and to come out of his home, like he will

06:36.920 --> 06:42.880
be isolated in his room, in his home, okay?

06:42.880 --> 06:44.880
That is a different world, okay?

06:44.880 --> 06:50.520
People are isolated on social media, yes, they will have a lot of friends from around

06:50.520 --> 06:55.600
the world, but they won't be able to meet them or talk to them, that is just an isolation,

06:55.600 --> 07:02.680
that is, you know, a company doesn't mean only messaging and only texting, a company

07:02.680 --> 07:09.120
means being sitting together, talking together, like drinking together, and walking together,

07:09.120 --> 07:15.200
it doesn't mean that only texting is enough, so it's a separate world, isolated, people

07:15.200 --> 07:21.280
are isolated from the rest of the world, they have their own world, fine?

07:21.280 --> 07:26.960
The next point is, it creates uncertainty and unpredictability, people are like, it creates

07:26.960 --> 07:32.440
uncertainty and unpredictability, it creates unpredictability, things become unpredictable,

07:32.440 --> 07:36.520
you cannot predict anything, like you will be predicting something, you will say it will

07:36.520 --> 07:45.400
have something, yes, many of the boys, like they will have friends, they will have a friend

07:45.400 --> 07:51.480
request or friends, like the account will be the name of a girl or something like that,

07:51.480 --> 07:56.920
but in reality that will be something else, okay, that is unpredictable, you cannot predict

07:56.920 --> 08:01.440
that this person is a girl or this person is a boy, okay, that is unpredictable and

08:01.440 --> 08:07.720
uncertain, because many of the boys are using girls' accounts these days and girls also

08:07.720 --> 08:13.800
use boys' accounts for some purposes, so it is unpredictable, like, okay, and some people

08:13.800 --> 08:20.120
like the anti-stat actors, like the violators, they also use certain type of IDs, you cannot

08:20.120 --> 08:26.720
predict that he's a traitor or he's a patriot, fine, and that he's working for the country

08:26.720 --> 08:31.400
or against it, you cannot predict anyone, so there is no predictability, there is no,

08:31.400 --> 08:37.160
like, no, no, no, no certainty, things are not certain and things are not predictable

08:37.160 --> 08:42.320
on social media, you cannot say something about anything on the social media, okay, it

08:42.320 --> 08:55.840
is like that, social media has psychological implications, social media has psychological

08:56.440 --> 09:04.640
implication, people are, the social media users, they are psychologically, like, they

09:04.640 --> 09:10.680
have psychologically been converted and been, like, attracted to the social media, they

09:10.680 --> 09:15.120
have psychological implication, they will not be feeling physically and mentally good

09:15.120 --> 09:20.480
when they are using social media a lot, okay, because they forget the real world and then

09:20.480 --> 09:25.760
they start living in the world of social media, they have no clue of the real world, then

09:25.920 --> 09:29.920
they think in these social media, they didn't drink and they eat and all the things, when

09:29.920 --> 09:34.800
they do these, they think about the social media, also have a psychological implication

09:34.800 --> 09:41.040
as well, because the real world is an active world, this is not the world of commenting

09:41.040 --> 09:45.960
and liking and messaging and texting, it's a real world, fine, so it has psychological

09:45.960 --> 09:53.520
implications, it has shaken the foundation of the nature of its old tradition and norms,

09:53.680 --> 09:58.240
fine, it has shaken the foundation of the centuries old traditions and norms, how?

10:00.000 --> 10:06.640
Long ago, like, previously people used to visit one another, to visit the homes and talk and

10:07.200 --> 10:11.760
have gossips and all these things, but these people don't visit each other, okay, there is

10:11.760 --> 10:17.040
a traditional norm, people don't visit each other, when it would be eat, previously people would go

10:17.040 --> 10:22.320
and they would impress each other and they would wish to eat, greet each other, but these

10:22.560 --> 10:29.680
are not the case, only texts are only commented on a post, happy eat to everybody and friends

10:29.680 --> 10:33.520
would come and they, friends will come and they will comment on the post, happy eat to you,

10:33.520 --> 10:38.880
and that is, that is not, you know that is the thing these days, people don't visit physically

10:38.880 --> 10:44.320
each other, like to, for wishing they happy eat, only commenting and only texting, that is enough,

10:44.320 --> 10:50.240
and because, because that has challenged the old tradition and norms of the society, fine,

10:51.200 --> 10:58.160
people used to, people used to, like, to, to visit the, the, the, the, the, the, the I'lling person,

10:58.160 --> 11:02.800
to visit the L person, the sick person, but these days they will only comment, get well soon,

11:02.800 --> 11:09.360
get well soon, that is, they don't visit, I had seen your status, you are, El and I commented on

11:09.360 --> 11:14.720
that, okay fine, not, see this is not the thing, fine, someone will get married these days and he

11:14.720 --> 11:18.560
will post on the social media and people will come, congratulations, congratulations and

11:18.560 --> 11:24.640
and congratulation no one will go to his or her home for for wishing him or her the engagement

11:24.640 --> 11:29.040
ceremony or the wedding ceremony so that is that is the thing these are the things fine

11:32.160 --> 11:37.440
it creates vulnerabilities yes it creates vulnerabilities you know people are

11:39.200 --> 11:46.320
the the the the the information and the secrecy are vulnerable these things can be easily traced

11:46.320 --> 11:57.920
okay the the the uh ids and the secrecy these are not safe okay the information these things are

11:57.920 --> 12:04.880
not safe on social media these can be be traced by some hackers and all the people and they can

12:04.880 --> 12:10.960
be used for illegal purposes you know vulnerabilities mean the things when things are vulnerable it

12:10.960 --> 12:17.600
mean the things are easily to be reached to fine and affected by so this is all about the

12:18.640 --> 12:26.000
social media social media is a kind of addiction yes it's a kind of addiction people are addicted

12:26.000 --> 12:31.360
to social media social means like the word save the snap the instagram the messenger the phall but

12:31.360 --> 12:37.280
when they don't use this that they feel a kind of like they feel a kind of pain they feel a kind of

12:38.240 --> 12:45.600
like restlessness restlessness they feel restless when they don't use the social media

12:45.600 --> 12:49.920
suppose you might have seen an addicted person everywhere he will go he will must open the

12:49.920 --> 12:54.400
facebook app and to check whether someone has texted me someone has posted and like that

12:54.400 --> 12:58.880
he will check or she will check the word save also the messenger the insta the snap check in

12:58.880 --> 13:03.600
order to see i don't think he will be thinking or she will be thinking in his or her mind that

13:03.600 --> 13:09.200
someone might have texted me so that is a kind of addiction okay people are addicted to social

13:09.200 --> 13:16.160
media like they cannot live without the social media they must use the social media they will

13:16.160 --> 13:21.520
have no money for the the rest of the thing but they will have the money for going to to have

13:21.520 --> 13:27.280
activated an internet package in order to see whether someone has texted me or like that fine

13:27.280 --> 13:33.840
so it is a time of you know it is an addiction social media is an addiction conclusion so

13:35.280 --> 13:40.240
in the conclusion we would say that social media it make us an anti-social like it

13:41.520 --> 13:46.640
it do all these things with us but in order to skip the addiction one should not be too much

13:47.600 --> 13:54.240
too much the too much related or too much attracted toward the social media because

13:54.240 --> 14:02.880
it has some positive and negative implications both thank you for watching us and hope you might

14:02.880 --> 14:06.080
have understood the argumentative essay stay with us
