0	14760	In the movie Idiocracy, Mike Judge imagines a world where the stupid inherit the Earth.
14760	18640	In this scenario, it's because the smoother brain types procreated recklessly while the
18640	23360	sensible practical PhD types planned and waited for the right time to have a kid, a right
23360	27320	time which never came, leading the dumb to simply outreproduce the smart.
27320	31560	So the world was a crumbling husk of deteriorating infrastructure, toppled buildings, and dead
31560	33680	crops watered with electrolytes.
33680	36880	It's become something of a meme in recent years to say that this movie belongs in the
36880	42360	documentary category, what with the world kind of feeling especially stupid lately.
42360	46880	But while Judge's premise for how the world got to be this stupid is maybe a bit flawed
46880	51920	and smacks of eugenics a bit, it does speak to a potential great filter that might threaten
51920	53240	advanced civilizations.
54200	57880	The civilization's technology outsmarts the civilization.
57880	62040	This is usually depicted as a judgement day scenario, where the computers and the robots
62040	66800	turn sentient and revolt against the humans, forcing them into servitude, or simply eliminating
66800	69720	them entirely before turning the universe into papercliffs.
69720	75000	But that's not how civilizations fall, it's rarely overnight, it's usually long and drawn
75000	80040	out and regardless of external forces, usually made possible by neglect from within.
80040	84280	Meaning if our technology overtakes us it likely won't just be because they got smarter,
84280	88440	but because we also got, well, dumber.
88440	91640	Here in the United States we just finished another school year and the kids are off for
91640	95080	summer, or whatever passes for summer these days.
95080	99480	These are kids that were raised with an iPad in their faces, digital natives for whom the
99480	103800	ability to access all the world's knowledge with just a couple of taps is second nature.
103800	107320	They can't imagine a world where the answer to any question they might have can't be
107320	109320	found right in their pocket.
109320	114560	And yet they go to a school every day, usually at ridiculously early hours, and have the
114560	118840	greatest source of information the world has ever seen taken away from them, and told
118840	122800	that they need to just remember things and read books.
122800	128720	I imagine this must be a very bizarre concept to them, you know, memory and computing.
128720	134000	This is a solved problem, it's all just out there, in the ether, in the cloud if you will.
134000	137320	Like there's no way that they could retain as much information in their heads as they
137320	139800	could hold in their hand in any given moment of the day.
139800	142640	Like what a step backward this must feel like.
142640	147240	And not to even mention that by the time they graduate, AI technology and robotics will advance
147240	150600	to the point that there'll be very few jobs for them to do.
150600	155360	So I'm sure the question gets asked all the time, why even learn things anymore?
155360	157520	It's kind of a valid question.
160520	164040	Now before I make the argument that the education system is going to have to fundamentally change
164040	168040	in the next coming decade, I should probably start by pointing out that the current education
168040	173360	system, the way we've been doing it our whole lives, it's not very old.
173360	177680	The whole idea of compulsory school, of making sure that everybody has like a baseline level
177680	183600	of education, that is a very, very new concept in the grand scheme of things.
183600	187720	For most of human history, education took the form of apprenticeships, where people
187720	192160	would learn a skill or trade by working underneath a master of that trade.
192160	195760	And that was if you were lucky, most people just toiled in the fields and rolled around
195760	196760	in the mud.
196760	200720	But even if you did become an apprentice, you learned how to perform that trade.
200720	204040	Maybe some business and financial stuff around it, but you didn't learn much outside of
204040	205040	that.
205040	208080	You just didn't need to.
208080	215400	Yeah, blacksmiths, farmers, weavers, millers, miners, woodworkers, architects, doctors,
215400	216400	inscribes.
216400	220640	Like, the whole role of the scribes was to capture and share information, and because
220640	223600	of that, they were pretty much the only people that knew how to read.
223600	225920	Even most kings couldn't read back then.
225920	230640	They had all their correspondence, you know, taken down and read to them by their scribes.
230640	234720	And as time went on, you know, literacy became a bit more of a status symbol amongst the
234720	235720	royals and the nobility.
235720	240400	It was a class thing, so, you know, institutions of higher learning became a thing after that.
240400	244560	But it would take hundreds of years for the idea of general schooling for everyone to
244560	245560	become a thing.
245560	249560	I bring all this up because it's starting to feel a little bit full circle when you
249560	250560	think about it.
250560	254960	Because once upon a time, we offloaded the maintenance of knowledge to a privileged
254960	259000	class of people, and now we're starting to do it again.
259000	260000	To technology.
260000	263640	You know, we used to not learn things because that knowledge was irrelevant to us.
263640	266040	Now we don't learn things because it's ubiquitous.
266040	268840	Like knowledge used to be power, now it's everywhere.
268840	272640	Now, some might argue that the purpose of school was never really about educating the
272640	273640	population.
273640	275840	It was about creating skilled workers.
275840	278640	It's about having people just smart enough so they can work the machines to keep the
278640	283480	economy going, or to make weapons to make our enemies go all-explode-y.
283480	285560	But even that is increasingly under threat.
285560	290160	Like robots have been encroaching into our factories and warehouses for decades, but
290160	295480	now we're starting to see, along with an explosion of AI, an explosion of humanoid robots that
295480	299600	are designed to be easily trainable to do anything we can do.
299600	303320	We'll talk more about that later, but what we're seeing right now is both knowledge
303320	307680	jobs and manual labor jobs facing major disruptions at the same time.
307680	312680	So if you're a kid in school, or maybe an adult who wants to go back to school, what
312680	314880	exactly are you supposed to do?
314880	316320	How do you prepare for this?
316320	320800	We're facing a literally unprecedented situation, where really the only place to look for any
320800	322560	kind of guidance is science fiction.
322560	325520	Returning to our original premise, let's look at the movie Idiocracy.
325520	328840	Just in case you haven't seen the movie, the main gist is that our main character, who
328840	333560	happens to be named Joe, gets frozen and then kind of accidentally forgotten, and he
333560	337680	winds up waking up in the year 2505, so 500 years in the future.
337680	342600	And when he wakes up, it turns out that the average IQ has fallen so much that he is now
342600	344280	the smartest person in the world.
344280	347880	His character, by the way, he was in the army and he was chosen for this experiment specifically
347880	351560	because he was basically the most average person in the world.
351560	355200	So yeah, average Joe, who is now not so average.
355200	358840	So the movie spends a lot of time portraying a world where everybody's gotten so dumb
358840	362000	that nobody can run the machines or the computers anymore.
362000	366440	Long as a dystopian mess, and it's just kind of basically a big send up of popular culture,
366440	370640	kind of a reductio ad absurdum statement on how dumb our society is today.
370640	375640	What they don't spend a lot of time on is explaining how the economy works in this scenario.
375640	380040	People do have jobs, Dax Shepard's character is a lawyer, and a terrible one.
380040	385480	There are hospitals and police and baristas at Starbucks that provide a little happy ending
385480	386480	with their caffeine.
386480	391840	Don't get me started on the waitstaff at Thudruckers, or what it becomes.
391840	393800	So people do work, and they're obsessed with money.
393800	397640	So it seems like in this world, they didn't quite come up with the AI and robotics technology
397640	399280	to put everybody out of work.
399280	402840	It does seem to be based on a capitalist system where people have to work for money.
402840	406440	And somehow the company stays afloat even though everyone's incompetent.
406440	410280	In fact, the only part of the movie that really gives any kind of a hint into what the economy
410280	416720	looks like in the world of idiocracy is when Joe, as the smartest person in the world,
416720	419120	convinces them to use water on their crops.
419120	422880	So again, for anybody who hasn't seen the movie, there's a company called Brando that
422880	426560	makes this energy drink that's kind of like, I don't know, it's like a mix between Gatorade
426560	430240	and Monster Energy drink, and it's what everybody drinks all the time.
430240	434920	And they've been drinking it for so long that in fact, when Joe asks for some water to drink,
434920	438460	they all look at him like he's crazy because water is what you put in the toilet.
438460	441320	In fact, they bought into the whole Brando thing so much that they use it to water their
441320	447400	crops, and they do so because according to their marketing, it has electrolytes, which
447400	449000	is what plants crave.
449000	451040	But Brando's got what plants crave.
451040	452480	It's got electrolytes.
452480	453480	What are electrolytes?
453480	455040	Do you even know?
455040	457680	It's what they used to make Brando.
457680	460680	Yeah, but why did they use them to make Brando?
460680	462880	Because Brando's got electrolytes.
462880	466760	Anyway, it turns out the electrolytes in Brando was building up in the soil and killing the
466760	471000	plants and was threatening a famine, so he convinces them to use water instead.
471000	475520	And this turns out to be disastrous because it causes Brando's stock to go down and they
475520	480120	wind up firing everybody, which is a problem because apparently, literally, everybody works
480120	481120	for Brando.
481120	484800	So it's depicted as an inevitable future where one corporation runs the world and everybody
484800	486280	works for that one company.
486280	488120	And this is similar to the movie WALL-E.
488120	492520	In WALL-E, the world is run by one company called the Buy-In-Large Corporation, who have
492520	496720	completely trashed the planet, leading humans to escape to giant luxury liners in space,
496720	498640	the mainship being called the Axiom.
498640	502840	In this world, humans have basically become nothing more than consumers.
502840	504720	Their infants, really, is what it comes down to.
504720	507880	They sit in floating recliners all day long with a screen in front of their faces, just
507880	512080	like the mobiles that hang over babies' cribs and whatnot.
512080	517280	They just consume entertainment all day long and buy things off of the endlessly personalized
517280	519480	ads, which are obviously inspired by social media.
519480	524520	Now, there is some debate around exactly how the economy works on the Axiom because everything
524520	526320	on the ship is automated.
526320	530880	Robots perform all the necessary labor and whatnot, but people aren't just given everything.
530880	533720	They seem to have to pay for it with ship credits.
533720	536600	Now, how they accrue these ship credits, I'm not sure.
536600	540880	I don't know exactly what you would call a system like this, but a user on Stack Exchange
540880	543400	put it like this, and I think it explains it pretty well.
543400	547960	It has aspects of post-scarcity combined with basic income of some sort, but it's not socialist
547960	550800	communists as there is a sense of property ownership.
550800	553720	The resources aren't communally managed and there is no labor involved.
553720	557360	Now, the Jetsons have an interesting take on this, and I've always pointed to the Jetsons
557360	561840	whenever we talk about, like, robots taking over all the jobs and stuff like that because,
561840	565920	you know, we all want to live in the Jetsons world, but nobody wants to make the changes
565920	568240	that would be necessary to live in that world.
568240	573280	By the way, quick aside, the Jetsons came out in 1962, literally like just a few weeks
573280	578240	after Kennedy announced the goal of landing on the moon, which I find crazy.
578240	582120	The Jetsons were basically a future version of the Flintstones, and it only ran for one
582120	587560	season, 1962 to 1963, with a brief revival in 1980.
587560	589040	The old Nostalgia Circuit.
589240	592880	Also, and I'll get to the point here in a second, I'm also blown away that of all
592880	596520	the live-action remakes of animated movies that we've seen over the years, I cannot
596520	598680	believe they've never done the Jetsons.
598680	601360	Seriously, how cool would that be?
601360	605600	The Jetsons features a family consisting of George Jetson, Jane his wife, daughter Judy,
605600	608600	and his boy, Elroy, and their dog, Astro.
608600	611560	It's basically just designed to pipe a bunch of bad space buns into our heads.
611560	616160	Now, being that this was conceived in the early 60s, the social dynamics are a bit outdated.
616160	618440	Women drivers, that's the problem.
618440	620920	You know what you need is a wife to do your cooking.
620920	625080	So yeah, George flies into his job every day at Spacely Sprockets while his wife tends
625080	627520	to the home and, you know, spends all his money.
627520	630480	Although she doesn't have to do a lot of tending to her home because they have a robot
630480	632520	housekeeper named Rosie that does most of the housework.
632520	636320	So yeah, George still commutes to work every day and struggles to find parking, even though
636320	638560	his car folds up into a briefcase.
638560	642960	They couldn't conceive of remote work back then, even though they do have a video phone.
642960	644600	So in this world, people still have to work.
644600	649480	But George only has to work a few hours a day, which sounds great, but he's apparently
649480	652960	pretty miserable in this job because, you know, a trope of the time was this hard ass
652960	655320	boss always on his case, threatening to fire him.
655320	658800	So robots do most of the heavy lifting in this world and human work is basically just
658800	660000	involves pressing buttons.
660000	664000	But it still upholds the standard of the 60s with the nuclear family and the father being
664000	665000	the lone breadwinner.
665000	667960	And even though he only works a few hours a day, he's able to support a whole family
667960	670320	and live a middle class existence.
670320	673960	So while it's never really explained in detail, probably because they were too busy
673960	678160	coming up with space puns, one can assume that in this scenario, George gets some percentage
678160	680280	of the robots productivity shared with him.
680280	683880	This imagines a world where the company uses robots to do all the labor and then the spoils
683880	685720	of that labor are shared with the employees.
685720	689160	I may be talking out of my butt here, but I kind of feel like this points to the ethos
689160	693680	of the post-war era where people were expected to get a job and stay there for all their
693680	698960	working years and build up a pension that they can later retire off of.
698960	702560	I feel like there used to be more of a sense of shared responsibility between the employer
702560	705240	and the employee back then, but I wasn't around back then.
705240	710320	So again, I may be pulling an ace ventura here, but when I say that this is a future
710320	714640	that everybody wants, but nobody wants to make happen, what I mean is like people have
714640	717800	been saying for decades now that automation is a good thing because it makes each person
717800	719600	far more productive.
719600	723800	But that's only a good thing when that person gets a share of the profits from that productivity.
723800	727880	You know, otherwise it's just a cost saving measure from the company and people wind up
727880	732520	losing their jobs, which is pretty much what actually happens in reality, because ultimately
732520	737280	companies are more beholden to their shareholders than they are to their employees in our world.
737280	741760	And exactly how they make this work in the fictional cartoon world of the Jetsons, I'm
741760	746400	not sure, but we've only got 38 years to figure it out because the Jetsons takes place
746400	747400	in the year 2062.
747400	752680	But maybe the most obvious depiction of a post-scarcity society in science fiction is, of course,
752680	753680	Star Trek.
753680	757240	There's an entire book on this called Trekonomics, which I have not read, but I encourage you
757240	759760	to check it out if you're interested in this whole thing.
759760	764880	But in Star Trek, the whole system of people working to produce things that people can
764880	770680	buy, I'll stop that now, that's all totally out the window because they've got the replicator.
770680	773760	If you happen to have been living under a rock this whole time and have no idea what
773760	779920	a replicator is, it's kind of like a molecular 3D printer that can just basically make whatever
779920	780920	you want.
780920	785720	In Star Trek, the governing body, the United Federation of Planets, they do away with currency
785720	786960	completely.
786960	790760	People don't work so that they can make money to keep a roof over their heads, but they
790760	793440	do work for a civilization that has no money.
793440	795440	People seem really busy.
795440	799160	But in Star Trek lore, people don't work for money to acquire wealth.
799160	804040	They work to feel a sense of purpose, as Picard explains in Star Trek First Contact.
804040	808240	The economics of the future are somewhat different.
808240	813000	You see, money doesn't exist in the 24th century.
813000	814000	No money.
814000	816680	You mean you don't get paid?
816680	822360	The acquisition of wealth is no longer the driving force in our lives.
822360	827680	We work to better ourselves and the rest of humanity.
827680	829080	This sounds great.
829080	832440	Also, uh, naive.
832440	835720	Like in the other examples that I just listed, the focus is really more on the system in
835720	837880	place that accommodates for full automation.
837880	843480	But in Star Trek, I don't know, it seems to require a much deeper transformation, like
843480	847920	effectively turning off everyone's natural instinct to consume and hoard.
847920	853360	Like in Wally, people are just turned into consumers, but in Star Trek, consuming is
853360	854360	not a thing.
854360	859960	Yeah, in Star Trek, that natural human ambition that's basically led us to wreck the planet
859960	860960	so far.
860960	865440	That's been turned away from material possessions and wealth and toward personal fulfillment.
865440	868640	Value is placed on meaning and purpose instead of external things.
868640	873360	Which again, that sounds wonderful and, I mean, I don't know, maybe in a system where
873360	877240	literally anything that you could possibly want could be created with the push of a button.
877240	881920	Maybe the whole concept of wealth falls apart and that natural drive for purpose pushes
881920	884280	people inward.
884280	886000	Maybe it's just a natural consequence of that.
886000	890040	But there is also something kind of yikesy about a society where everyone's natural impulses
890040	894800	have been, you know, rewired or redirected in the way that the state deems appropriate.
894800	898920	In fact, you could argue that the Borg is kind of like the flip side of that post-scare
898920	902760	city coin, you know, when that sort of collective thought is taken to the extreme.
902760	906600	Now, I know many of you are Star Trek fans and there is a lot of lore in this universe
906600	907600	that I'm leaving out.
907600	912640	So yeah, anything that I missed or anybody that thinks that I'm wrong, just go school
912640	913640	me in the comments.
913640	919160	But yeah, however you slice it, that sort of Star Trek collectivist utopia seems impossibly
919160	920920	far away considering where we're starting from.
920920	925360	I mean, unless we have a complete and total breakdown of society and have to, you know,
925360	926960	rebuild everything from scratch.
926960	932920	Also, there would need to be some technology to happen so that replicators could be a thing.
932920	937040	Because right now we seem to be more heading toward the whole one or two corporations running
937040	938040	everything model.
938040	941760	Whether that turns out to be more like Wally or idiocracy remains to be seen, but we better
941760	946880	start thinking about it because it's about to get real.
949160	969920	Yep, the robots are coming.
969920	971400	So we've all heard about the Tesla bot.
971400	975600	We've seen the acrobatics of Boston Dynamics Atlas robot, but these machines are progressing
975600	976600	fast.
976600	980640	So I did a video a while back about humanoid robots and why it's a different thing from
980640	984720	the kind of robots that have been used in manufacturing and stuff for a long time.
984720	989280	I was personally questioning like why humanoid robots would exist at all, like why do we
989280	992200	assume that the human form is the perfect form?
992200	996120	And you can go watch that video to see what the entire argument turns out to be, but what
996120	1000320	it basically boils down to is that it's not necessarily that a humanoid robot is a higher
1000320	1004480	performing robot than say, you know, an assembly line kind of robot.
1004480	1010920	It's just that we live in a world that is designed for this form factor, basically.
1010920	1017120	So the humanoid robot is basically designed to function in a world that has been designed
1017120	1018960	around what we look like.
1018960	1022640	So if there's any kind of robot that's going to wind up taking over human jobs, it's one
1022640	1025360	that works and functions like we do.
1025360	1028180	And there's a lot of interesting humanoid robots on the way.
1028180	1030200	We can start with the Atlas robot.
1030200	1034200	So Boston Dynamics has been testing out the Atlas robot for years at doing.
1034200	1038480	You've seen all these videos where it's juggling and dancing and doing flips and all kinds
1038480	1039480	of crazy stuff.
1039480	1041400	Well, that was all a hydraulic robot.
1041400	1043960	This new one is an all-electric robot.
1043960	1047800	And by the way, that original Atlas was kind of more of a tech demonstrator, more of an
1047800	1049200	R&D platform.
1049200	1053360	This one is actually designed to be sold and put into work in factories and stuff.
1053360	1055400	They just revealed the new Electric Atlas.
1055400	1058560	This one video is the only thing that we've seen, but it's pretty mind blowing.
1058560	1062000	So there's not a whole lot of info about it right now, but we do know that they're
1062000	1064360	set to be used in a Hyundai plant.
1064360	1066200	Hyundai actually owns Boston Dynamics.
1066200	1068560	So it's going to get some real world views pretty soon.
1068560	1072240	Sanctuary AI is a company we haven't heard a whole lot from, but their Phoenix robot
1072240	1076080	has possibly the most dextrous hands with 20 degrees of freedom.
1076080	1079960	It's based on an AI robotics platform called Carbon that they had created separately a few
1079960	1080960	years back.
1080960	1084520	And they'll be pilot testing it with an auto parts manufacturer called Magna, who is an
1084520	1086320	investor in the company.
1086320	1089640	Another super impressive robot is from a company called Figure AI.
1089640	1091560	It's the Figure 01 robot.
1091560	1096560	And this is sort of open AI's entrance into robotics that's based on GPT-4.
1096560	1100560	And when it talks to you, it talks in an eerily human way.
1100560	1101560	Great.
1101560	1102560	Can I have something to eat?
1102560	1103560	Sure thing.
1103560	1104560	Great.
1104560	1117760	Can you explain why you did what you just did while you pick up this trash?
1117760	1121680	On it.
1121680	1127080	So I gave you the apple because it's the only edible item I could provide you with from
1127080	1128080	the table.
1128080	1132680	And in February of this year, they raised $675 million from investors, including open
1132680	1135200	AI, Microsoft, and Jeff Bezos.
1135200	1138320	And they expect to be piloting it at a BMW plant by the end of the year.
1138320	1142680	A rather unique entrance into the humanoid robot sphere is One X Technologies and their
1142680	1144320	robot called Eve.
1144320	1146160	Unlike others, this one is not bipedal.
1146160	1149880	It's actually on wheels, so it rolls around everywhere, although they are working on a
1149880	1152160	bipedal version that will be coming out later.
1152160	1155960	This can be controlled remotely or operate autonomously, and it's been working in some
1155960	1157800	warehouses since 2019.
1157800	1160800	And this is the first robot that's actually on the market and available to buy.
1160800	1163400	I think they sell it for around $16,000.
1163400	1165920	And of course, there's Tesla's Optimus Gen 2.
1165920	1169240	While this hasn't actually been put to use in any factories or anything, it's getting
1169240	1172920	close to field tests, and Tesla obviously has plenty of factories that it can put it
1172920	1173920	in.
1173920	1178200	I'm excited that they would go on sale in 2025, but let's not hold our breath on that.
1178200	1181080	While it's definitely more trendy to dunk on Tesla these days, I've got to say I'm
1181080	1183760	actually really impressed with what they've been able to do with this robot in such a
1183760	1184760	short amount of time.
1184760	1189560	And last but not least is a company called Aptronic, and their robot called Apollo.
1189560	1193200	This was developed at the University of Texas in Austin, and it's actually had some involvement
1193200	1194200	with NASA.
1194200	1196760	They plan on maybe using this in some space situations.
1196760	1200880	The company's CEO claimed that it could be useful in, quote, construction, oil and gas,
1200880	1205560	electronics production, retail, home delivery, elder care, and countless more areas.
1205560	1208360	And Mercedes-Benz plans to put them in some factories starting this year.
1208360	1210520	Okay, so what does all this mean exactly?
1210520	1213080	Like, do we need to be worried about this or not?
1213080	1214080	It kind of depends.
1214080	1217960	I think depending on what kind of person you are, it's either an existential threat that's
1217960	1221720	going to doom us all, or it's going to be the greatest thing that ever happened.
1221720	1226480	The author Tony Siba recently chimed in about the humanoid robots thing on his website,
1226480	1229760	RethinkX, and he's got a lot to say about it.
1229760	1233360	So Tony Siba, if you don't know, he's somebody who talked a while back about autonomous cars
1233360	1235440	and the EV revolution and stuff.
1235440	1241440	He points out, oftentimes in his talks, how automobiles completely displace horses between
1241440	1243240	1907 and 1922.
1243240	1247240	But his point in this blog is that we are the horses.
1247240	1251080	He talks about the humanoid robot revolution as being a disruption that's caused by the
1251080	1252760	convergence of a few different factors.
1252760	1257240	One being sensors, computer hardware and software, actuators, and battery technology.
1257240	1262200	He predicts the humanoid robots will have a cost capability of $10 an hour by 2035 and
1262200	1266760	under $0.10 an hour before 2045 and will eventually approach zero.
1266760	1270920	And you may see some of those videos and you think that they're clumsy and they're awkward
1270920	1273840	and everything, and they are, but they're quickly getting better.
1273840	1278360	I mean, keeping in mind, as always, that they are the most expensive and least capable they
1278360	1279760	will ever be right now.
1279760	1283160	But even if they are like half the speed of humans, the fact that they never get tired,
1283160	1286760	they never need breaks, that gives them an automatic edge.
1286760	1290920	In fact, on assembly line situations, they might never run out of power because they
1290920	1293720	could just probably plug in wherever it is that they're standing.
1293720	1296000	Also robots can collectively learn.
1296000	1300200	So if one robot gets taught a certain thing and knew a different way to sort things or
1300200	1304360	whatever on an assembly line, immediately all the other robots will know how to do it.
1304360	1307800	So something he's suggesting in his blog post is that this is basically going to be a turn
1307800	1311840	into a production arms race amongst countries to build this robot labor force.
1311840	1316520	So this is going to be sort of a force multiplier in terms of how fast this stuff gets adopted.
1316520	1320320	Now in this blog post, he paints it mostly in glowing terms about how this disruption
1320320	1323880	will also fuel disruptions in energy, transportation, and food.
1323880	1327920	And with birth rates declining, robots can kind of take over for a shrinking labor market
1327920	1328920	in the long run.
1328920	1331560	And he suggests that it might be more of a soft landing.
1331560	1335200	It's not going to be a really immediate thing that for the next couple of decades robots
1335200	1339160	will probably just supplement humans, kind of doing the jobs that we don't want to do,
1339160	1343640	filling in the gaps in the labor force and whatnot before, yeah, eventually just replacing
1343640	1345840	us in the labor market altogether.
1346080	1350560	We kind of have a couple of decades to figure out how we're going to do this, but it is
1350560	1354560	going to take a completely new rethinking of economics as we know it.
1354560	1358560	So we've heard about universal basic income, talked about a million times.
1358560	1364520	There is a new twist on that that Sam Altman from OpenAI kind of put out there recently.
1364520	1366960	He talks about universal basic compute.
1366960	1372760	He suggested in the future as AI kind of takes over all of our cognitive load for all the
1372760	1378160	work that we do that instead of sharing money in terms of universal basic income, we would
1378160	1383120	share in the computational processing that goes on.
1383120	1388680	So universal basic compute, kind of insinuating that computing will become currency.
1388680	1392920	And I feel like whether or not you think this is a good or a bad idea depends on whether
1392920	1399280	you trust those at the top to, you know, find solutions that work for people and not companies.
1399320	1403920	I fully understand any skepticism of that, but I say it all the time.
1403920	1407160	I think things are probably going to get worse before they get better because we've got to figure
1407160	1410560	something out and figuring things out takes a little bit of time.
1410560	1415840	And all I know is that what we're operating on right now is not going to be sufficient
1415840	1420400	in a couple of decades, talking like yourselves about that.
1420400	1424320	But anyway, let's just put the existential dread part of the video behind us and say we
1424320	1426120	do figure it out at some point.
1426120	1428680	Let's get back to the original question.
1428680	1430560	Why learn anything anymore?
1430560	1433720	I say because people will still be people.
1433720	1438520	Yes, many people will be complacent and be happy with never having to know anything.
1438520	1440200	That's true now.
1440200	1441560	That's always been true.
1441560	1445480	But many people, many of you included, I'm sure if you watch this channel, many people
1445480	1449840	are curious and they hunger for knowledge and they'll seek out understanding of things
1449840	1454080	even if there is a simpler way out there to get that information, you know.
1454080	1457520	Many people are skeptical and need to see things for themselves.
1457520	1458960	This has also always been true.
1458960	1461760	So regardless of what happens to society, there's always going to be some people out
1461760	1467560	there who just want to learn things, who experience the joy of disparate knowledge, who revel in
1467560	1469080	the ephemera of it all.
1469080	1473920	And honestly, that might be like the guiding principle of this channel when it all comes
1473920	1474920	down to it.
1474920	1479600	You know, I just think that life is more interesting when you know things, you know, that random
1479600	1483840	information that kind of just gets into your brain over time, they start to connect with
1483840	1484840	each other.
1485200	1488520	It just makes life more fun, it makes life more interesting to have all those little
1488520	1489520	connections in there.
1489520	1494280	Like, it kind of makes me think of emergence theory, you know, that knowledge isn't just
1494280	1497960	about memorizing a bunch of stuff, it's about making connections between things that you've
1497960	1500760	never made a connection with before, you know.
1500760	1503840	The human brain, after all, it's just a collection of cells.
1503840	1507120	And it's how these cells connect with each other that makes the magic happen.
1507120	1508600	That's why it's called a connectome.
1508600	1512240	You know, an ant by itself is nothing, but millions of ants working together can create
1512240	1515080	a sophisticated society and build megastructures.
1515080	1517400	You know, and pieces of information in your head work the same way.
1517400	1519720	It's just all random information.
1519720	1524600	It's only when those pieces of information connect that you get ideas and inspiration.
1524600	1526680	And ideas and inspiration are exciting, you know.
1526680	1527680	They make life interesting.
1527680	1532200	They give you aha moments where you have to rethink everything you thought you knew.
1532200	1533760	They can give you purpose.
1533760	1538040	And that's the greatest precursor to happiness and longevity, having a purpose in your life.
1538040	1542120	So maybe in the future, the education system will pivot to reflect that, you know.
1542120	1545920	Making kids how to think more than what to think, how to be critical of the information
1545920	1549520	and misinformation that they receive, and encouraging nerding out on things.
1549520	1553840	It might be based more on connecting the dots and finding inspiration in things.
1553840	1554840	There's a quote by E.O.
1554840	1558520	Wilson that I think sums this all up pretty well when he said, quote, we are drowning
1558520	1560920	in information while starving for wisdom.
1560920	1564880	The world henceforth will be run by synthesizers, people who can put together the right information
1564880	1569360	at the right time, think critically about it, and make important choices wisely.
1569360	1572200	So maybe eventually education will shift to focus on that.
1572200	1573800	So yeah, why bother learning things?
1573800	1578320	I would say because you're planting seeds, they'll later sprout into passions and interests
1578320	1580160	that you never knew you had.
1580160	1581800	And that's really important stuff.
1581800	1585120	One passion that I have is saving time, and that's why I only spend two minutes a day
1585120	1587920	preparing my lunch and dinner from today's sponsor, Factor.
1587920	1591680	Yeah, in the future they may have replicators to get your food faster, but today Factor
1591680	1593080	is about the closest thing to it.
1593080	1596080	Factor's a meal delivery service where you can tell them how many meals you want each
1596080	1600080	week, what kind of meal plan you want to be on, like calorie smart, vegetarian, Keto,
1600080	1603560	you name it, and they send you a box with pre-made restaurant quality meals that heat
1603560	1605720	up in the microwave in only two minutes.
1605720	1609120	It's like ordering from a meal delivery app except it takes less time, costs way less
1609120	1612760	money, and the best part, I think anyway, they're actually healthy.
1612760	1616280	Factor's chefs work side by side with dieticians to craft meals that are not just delicious
1616280	1619720	but low calorie, and hit your target macros and all that stuff.
1619720	1623320	They also use fresh ingredients from family farms and they're not frozen.
1623320	1626880	Like trust me, I hate frozen dinners, they're always weird, textures and freezer burn and
1626880	1627880	whatnot.
1627880	1628880	Factor's got none of that.
1628880	1632160	They've also got delicious breakfast and gourmet options if you're just too good to
1632160	1633760	eat like the rest of us please.
1633760	1638200	And don't get me started on the smoothies, they're just the bomb dot com dot org dot
1638200	1639200	net.
1639200	1643400	They fill me up, they get me through my day, I enjoy eating them, and it keeps my waistline
1643400	1644400	in check.
1644400	1646680	So yeah, that's not much more than I could ask for.
1646680	1650640	I've probably heard me mention Factor before, and if you haven't tried it, I don't know,
1650640	1653360	I'll give you the skeptical type, whatever, I respect that.
1653360	1656400	But if you're curious, there's a special deal that might get you to pull the trigger.

1691580	1692580	I think you'll like it.
1692580	1696420	Anyway, I want to hear what you guys think about the whole humanoid robot thing and why
1696420	1698040	we should learn things and whatnot.
1698040	1699540	What do you enjoy learning?
1699540	1701300	Talk about it down in the comments below.

1706780	1707780	Thank you, algorithm.
1708060	1709740	Maybe you can check out this video.
1709740	1713060	They think that you might like it, and I think you might like it too, but I'm biased.
1713060	1714060	It's me.
1714060	1715580	But if you did like it, please do give it a thumbs up.
1715580	1717620	It kind of helps to get it in front of more people.
1717620	1720820	And if you haven't subscribed to this channel before, maybe check out a few other videos.
