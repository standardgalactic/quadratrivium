0	5180	There was a period of time on 9-11 when nobody knew what was going on.
5180	7660	A plane had hit the World Trade Center.
7660	8940	Everybody on the news was talking about it.
8940	12260	There were rumors that other planes had been hijacked, that there was some kind of major
12260	14900	attack, but nobody knew for sure.
14900	19060	There were all kinds of crazy rumors swirling around, but in that moment, it was just as
19060	23660	likely that this was just a horrible accident, just a thing that went wrong, and nothing
23660	28020	more than that.
28020	30140	And then the second tower was hit.
30140	35140	That was the moment that all the confusion went away, and we all collectively realized
35140	40600	at the exact same time, oh, we're living in a different world now.
40600	43780	I think we're kind of having that moment right now with AI.
43780	47020	For the last 10 years or so, we have been hearing about how this technology is going
47020	48020	to change the world.
48020	50860	It's going to take all of our jobs, leave society unrecognizable.
50860	55540	There's just been this background anxiety about it, what AI could do, but for the most
55540	60140	part, it was just like an abstract thing that we couldn't really see or imagine.
60140	63940	But some recent advancements have made this abstract thing a lot more clear.
63940	71060	AIs that can generate articles, music, images, video, and code, meaning they could create
71060	72060	more AIs.
72060	75940	There are even people using AIs to build and run businesses, all by themselves, making
75940	77420	thousands of dollars a day.
77420	80780	At the very least, these are the new tools that in five years or so, you're going to
80780	82860	be at a disadvantage if you don't know how to use them.
82860	86100	And at the very most, we're seeing just the tip of the iceberg of a technology that will
86100	90700	radically reshape our society in ways that we can't possibly comprehend.
90700	94780	What we're seeing right now is AI's second tower moment.
94780	98860	Whichever way this goes, we're in a different world now.
98860	105180	All right, so this is a video about what's going on with AI right now.
105180	112500	And the thing is, what's going on with AI right now is it's changing extremely fast.
112620	116380	There are entire channels dedicated to following this stuff that post multiple times a week
116380	120860	and they're struggling to keep up, so the idea that this video is going to be timely
120860	121860	is just laughable.
121860	124740	Yeah, things have happened since you started watching this video that already makes this
124740	125740	video obsolete.
125740	128140	And that's kind of the whole point.
128140	132740	For years we've been hearing about the idea of the singularity, the moment that AI outpaces
132740	135860	us and the unimaginable becomes real.
135860	137820	I covered it a few times early on in this channel.
137820	141380	And I've been making the argument actually for the most part that when you step back
141380	145620	and you scale things back and look at the big picture, we're in the singularity.
145620	146940	We've been in it for a couple hundred years.
146940	151340	Yeah, I kind of got away from the idea that the singularity was this one single event,
151340	154020	just one moment when everything changed all at once.
154020	158020	I started seeing it as an era of history that began maybe with the birth of the Industrial
158020	161900	Revolution when we learned how to harness energy or maybe even the invention of the
161900	165540	printing press and we learned how to pass information on through space and time.
165540	167180	Everything just kind of hockey sticks after that.
167500	172740	But what's been happening lately is starting to feel like the classic version of the singularity.
172740	173740	You know?
173740	176980	Like we're just rolling downhill and about to cross the event horizon of this thing where
176980	178380	there's no going back.
178380	180060	Hyperbole much, Joe?
182620	183620	I don't know.
183620	185340	I mean, not if you listen to the hype around it.
185340	188940	Judging on the hype that you've been hearing about AI, this could go in two very different
188940	189940	ways.
189940	194300	On one hand, AI could solve all of our problems, cure cancer, create new methods of propulsion
194300	195660	and clean energy.
195660	199380	All the issues we're currently dealing with that we fear will destroy us someday, AI could
199380	203900	be an unimaginably powerful tool to solve those problems.
203900	205380	This is one possible outcome.
205380	210740	But then there's the other outcome, where in an inconceivably short time AI becomes smarter
210740	215060	than us, it becomes an intelligence we can't possibly fathom, leading to the extinction
215060	216060	of the human race.
216060	220860	And to me anyway, no discussion of AI is possible without talking about both the good and the
220860	221860	bad.
221860	224580	So that's what I'm going to try to do here.
224580	225580	And it's difficult.
225580	229060	I'm trying really hard, guys.
229060	233820	Honestly, I have had to restart this video like four or five different times, because
233820	238340	every time I thought that I was done, I would find some article or see some video that kind
238340	242940	of threw my entire point out the window and I would have to start all over again.
242940	246580	There's just so many takes on this subject and it's not that any of them are wrong, actually
246580	248700	the problem is that a lot of them are right.
248700	249700	They're probably all right.
249700	251420	In fact, one of them got into eugenics.
251420	252420	I didn't see that coming.
252420	255300	I mean, nobody even knows exactly how these things work.
255300	259340	Even the experts that have been working on this for decades, so like how am I supposed
259340	261300	to add anything to this conversation?
261300	263940	Like what can I possibly say that hasn't already been said?
263940	266740	And if I'm being honest, I haven't even really been keeping up with this.
266740	270300	There's like a 50,000 AI apps out there and I haven't been able to mess with any of them
270300	272420	because I'm always just trying to get the next video out.
272420	275540	So not only am I trying to make an informative video out of this thing, I've got to get
275540	278860	caught up on a technology that I've been following way behind on like I couldn't feel
278860	280860	more older and out of touch.
280860	283940	And the biggest irony of all is that I'm sitting here struggling really hard to write a script
283940	288100	about a technology whose core value is that it can write the script for me.
288100	290740	Maybe I should just pick up where my last AI video left off.
290740	293420	When was the last time I made a video about AI?
293420	297260	My last video on AI was in 2016.
297260	298260	Wow.
298260	302780	Oh, there's a little baby YouTuber back then.
302780	305900	Okay, so yeah, the last video was talking about the three different levels of AI.
305900	307940	So why don't we just do a quick refresher on that?
307940	308940	All right.
308940	309940	Let's take a quick picture.
309940	311860	When we talk about AI, there's three different levels.
311860	315540	There's artificial narrow intelligence, artificial general intelligence, and artificial super
315540	316540	intelligence.
316540	319380	Narrow AI is what we've been dealing with for a long time now.
319380	324580	This has taken the form of chatbots to spell check, image processing that helps with photography,
324580	327260	astronomy, medical diagnostics, and so on.
327260	328940	Voice recognition is a kind of AI.
328940	330460	Virtual assistance like Siri and Alexa.
330460	333860	There's all kinds of AI in gaming, aviation, search engines.
333860	334860	The list goes on.
334860	338580	AI's help make our jobs easier and our lives more efficient in a million different ways.
338580	341540	It's also manipulated our society in ways we're just now beginning to come to grips
341540	342540	with.
342540	345940	All the polarization, isolation, depression that we've been seeing by social media, these
345940	350060	are products of algorithms that are themselves a kind of AI.
350060	353500	I know some of the biggest algorithm experts at YouTube, and I can tell you they're just
353500	357020	trying to figure it out like the rest of us, only they have millions of channels worth
357020	359540	of data to deal with versus one or a few channels.
359540	362220	Yeah, the algorithm is basically like an alien life form.
362220	363980	Nobody really knows how it works.
363980	369140	It's a black box that nobody can see inside of or understand, much less control.
369140	370460	This is the point that will come up later.
370460	374180	Yeah, all of these AI's are amazing and powerful, but they're all examples of, again, narrow
374180	375180	AI.
375180	378380	They're built and trained to do one specific thing, and they do that one specific thing
378380	381500	better than any person could, but that's all they can do.
381500	385100	And we're already seeing this bifurcation of scenarios, you know, simultaneously incredible
385100	388740	and amazing, but also tearing apart the fabric of society.
388740	392500	Artificial general intelligence is AI that can do all the things that narrow AI can do,
392500	393500	but for everything.
393780	395900	It's a generalist, much more like a human being.
395900	397260	I want to make sure that I'm clear here.
397260	400180	I'm not talking about consciousness or sentience at this point.
400180	401420	This isn't an artificial life form.
401420	404180	We're not talking about giving it personhood or rights or anything.
404180	407740	In fact, the consciousness thing, it doesn't even play into this conversation right now.
407740	411680	I think it's better to just kind of set that aside.
411680	413780	That muddy's waters that are already pretty muddy.
413780	417540	A general AI is just AI that can have the same capacities as a human brain.
417540	420700	It can analyze images, but it can also make music.
420700	422780	It can problem solve and strategize.
422780	424460	It can deceive and manipulate.
424460	428500	Here's the thing about artificial general intelligence, though, when it does happen,
428500	429500	you'll probably miss it.
429500	434220	Because if an AI has the same capacity that we have, well, one of the capacities that
434220	436660	we have is that we can make an AI smarter.
436660	443220	So if an AI that's as smart as we are can create a smarter AI, that by definition is
443220	445060	artificial superintelligence.
445060	448660	This is what futurists have been saying for a long time now, that pretty much the instant
448660	452620	we reach artificial general intelligence, we will reach artificial superintelligence.
452620	455140	AI that's smarter than a human.
455140	457020	Smarter than all humans combined for that matter.
457020	460460	And this is where things really split into a couple of different directions.
460460	465380	On one hand, we could see a utopia where every disease has a cure, aging can be reversed,
465380	470620	resources perfectly allocated for all, the climate and equilibrium, economic recessions,
470620	474780	forever eradicated, all our wants and needs fulfilled, so we can spend our limitless lives
474780	477020	and pursue knowledge and happiness.
477020	480460	We're in an effort to get rid of all conflict that suppresses us all into an authoritarian
480460	484460	surveillance state devoid of free will, with all of our wants and needs doled out according
484460	489340	to its all-powerful insistence on order, creating a techno-slave state.
489340	492860	Or it could decide that the common denominator in all the world's problems is humanity itself
492860	496100	and wipes us out the face of the earth, replacing us with robots and machines that live on for
496100	499580	a billion years, eventually spreading to distant stars and eradicating all potential life in
499580	506860	the universe from existence.
507860	513380	There is, of course, another option, which is that all of this is just hype.
513380	517340	Just way overblown hype by companies who invested billions of dollars into this and
517340	519060	now need to sell the product they made.
519060	522380	In fact, there's an argument to be made that this is just another gold rush.
522380	524220	AI is the new crypto.
524220	528060	And there definitely is a gold rush of sorts going on with all these new AI tools suddenly
528060	532380	being integrated in everything with a keyboard, some of which are awesome, yeah, but some
532380	534820	of which just don't make any bloody sense.
534820	536820	But really, this isn't anything new.
536820	540380	Technology has been using AI as a catch-all buzzword for the last decade.
540380	543300	It's just like this thing that they say to convince you to buy their product and say
543300	546900	that their product is better because it has AI in it, you know, everything from cars to
546900	550420	HVAC units to washing machines, coffee makers.
550420	556020	Tech investors need to beware, 40% of companies in Europe are now claimed to be AI startups
556020	560140	have actually, if you can believe this, little or no connection with artificial intelligence
560140	561140	at all.
561140	565540	Now, in these cases, the AI is usually just like an algorithm that allows a device to
565580	567860	self-adjust or optimize according to the situation.
567860	572380	And they've got their merits, you know, as the kind of narrow AI I was just talking about.
572380	573940	But it is also just marketing.
573940	576420	So, yeah, on one hand, AI is nothing new.
576420	579220	It's been used to sell us on products for a long time.
579220	582220	What we're dealing with right now, though, is something different.
582220	583660	This is generative AI.
583660	586460	Not to be confused with general AI that I was talking about a second ago.
586460	589220	Generative AI, though, it's exactly what it sounds like.
589220	591820	It's AI that generates something that didn't exist before.
591860	595780	And this does feel like it just kind of popped up out of nowhere in the last couple of years.
595780	599860	But again, it's really just a culmination of a lot of things we've been getting used
599860	601020	to for a while now.
601020	604380	We kind of started seeing the first sparks of this back in 2015 when videos like this
604380	607940	from Google's Deep Dream Project started kind of making their way around the Internet.
607940	611700	The AI would basically start off with a picture and then it would find patterns in that picture
611700	615380	and the alignment of pixels and whatnot that it would recognize as other images, kind of
615380	617820	like us seeing faces or shapes in the clouds.
617820	621020	It would then pull from a set of images and insert them into the image leading to these
621020	625540	mind-bidding visuals of animals and faces reminiscent of a heroic dose of mushrooms.
625540	627460	Or so I've heard.
627460	631820	Following that, the research continued into training AI models to recognize objects and
631820	632820	images.
632820	635300	That's pretty much what all those captures were all about, finding the stoplights and
635300	636300	the cars in the images.
636300	639300	You've been training AI models this whole time and didn't even know it.
639300	642780	You also started to see tools in Photoshop like content-aware fill and scale that will
642780	646860	intelligently replace objects and add extra photo to the photo based on the space around
646860	647860	it.
647860	649300	That got fully integrated into Photoshop in 2019.
649340	651660	I actually use this all the time on my thumbnails.
651660	655780	And then there's the AI video and image filters that started on Snapchat and then on TikTok.
655780	659860	Then there was a trend of AI-generated avatars and social media through apps like Lenza.
659860	662980	I'm leaving a lot out, but the point is that all of these little AI tools and toys have
662980	665740	been around for years and becoming more and more popular.
665740	668700	Now at the same time that all this was happening, there were AI's that were learning natural
668700	669820	language patterns.
669820	674380	The first autocorrect features and word processors went back as far as 2003, but it became especially
674380	676300	useful with the advent of smartphones.
676300	679940	A lot of text and phones and search engines soon followed, voice recognition paired with
679940	683500	natural language models led to Siri in 2011, Alexa in 2014.
683500	688380	And then in 2021, OpenAI announced Dahle, which put the image and text features together
688380	691900	and had the ability to create entirely new images based off of text prompts.
691900	695940	All that labeling of objects and text recognition at all kind of came together so that if you
695940	700620	entered the word camel, it knows what a camel is and it can search its massive image archive
700620	702620	and it creates something that resembles a camel.
702620	704860	The first Dahle was kind of under the radar though.
704860	706380	It was kind of just made for research purposes.
706380	709740	It was Dahle 2 that came out last year in 2022.
709740	712540	That's what gave public access to this technology for the first time.
712540	716100	Mid Journey came out about the same time and people kind of lost their minds.
716100	720580	For the first time, literally anybody could just enter some words into a prompt and get
720580	722380	a pretty good quality image out of it.
722380	725060	And yet anybody who's been following this even a little bit can attest to how quickly
725060	726900	this AI art has evolved.
726900	731300	And then by the time we got used to all that, here comes ChatGPT.
731300	732300	ChatGPT.
732300	733300	ChatGPT.
733300	734300	ChatGPT.
734300	735300	ChatGPT.
735300	736300	ChatGPT.
736300	737300	ChatGPT.
737300	738300	ChatGPT.
738300	739300	ChatGPT.
739300	740300	ChatGPT.
740300	743780	Okay, so ChatGPT, in case you don't already know, it works off what's called a large
743780	745580	language model or LLM.
745580	747100	LLMs are neural networks.
747100	751660	A neural network is a computer system that basically works like a brain.
751660	755300	Just as a brain has billions of connections between neurons, LLMs have billions of connections
755300	757900	between mathematical functions that act like neurons.
757900	760340	I don't want to go too deep into how all this works, but I'll just quote a tweet from
760340	763060	Peter Yang, a creator of Economy SO, who said this quote.
763060	766300	Imagine that you have a library with a huge collection of books.
766300	769180	You want to learn everything you can from these books, such as how to write a good essay
769180	771140	and how to speak a foreign language.
771140	772140	How can you do that?
772140	775940	An LLM is a program that can generate text based off the books in your library.
775940	779740	So it does kind of work just like predictive text on your phone.
779740	783540	Where a phone has a library of a past text, it can kind of figure out what the most likely
783540	784540	next word is going to be.
784540	787420	So I'll say if you start to type your street address, it's learn that from watching your
787420	789180	text and it autocompletes it.
789180	793020	Only an LLM has millions upon millions of books and articles to draw from, and then
793020	795460	they kind of weigh what they read in terms of importance.
795460	799340	To be clear, this is a massive oversimplification, but you get the idea.
799340	802980	The process of feeding an LLM gobs of text is called pre-training.
802980	806700	When programmers want LLMs to get better at specific tasks, they can feed the LLM more
806700	807700	focused text.
807700	808700	This is called fine-tuning.
808700	811820	But it's not really interesting giving the right answer.
811820	814580	It's programmed to give the most likely answer.
814580	816060	And a lot of times that answer's right.
816060	818620	A lot of times it's not.
818620	822780	For example, when I asked chatGbt to give me five facts about the YouTuber Joe Scott,
822780	823780	this is what I got.
823780	827340	Joe Scott is an American science communicator and YouTuber who creates videos about science,
827340	828340	space, and technology.
828340	832580	He's been creating content on YouTube since 2014 and has over 1.5 million subscribers.
832580	833580	Accurate.
833580	836500	Before becoming a full-time YouTuber, Joe worked as an engineer and consultant in the
836500	837500	aerospace industry.
837500	841300	He has a degree in aerospace engineering and a master's degree in systems engineering.
842300	844180	This is not true.
844180	847660	Joe is known for his informative and well-researched videos which cover a wide range of scientific
847660	851620	topics from black holes in space exploration to artificial intelligence and genetics.
851620	852740	Well done, chatGbt.
852740	855820	In addition to his main channel, he has a second channel called Answers with Joe, where
855820	857900	he explores interesting questions that provide answers.
857900	858900	That's...
858900	862780	The second channel's called TMI, so swing and a miss.
862780	865180	Joe is an advocate for science education and outreach.
865180	866460	Sure, that's true.
866460	870740	He has spoken at events such as TEDx and collaborated with organizations such as NASA and the Planetary
870740	875980	Society to help promote science, literacy, and interest in space exploration.
875980	876980	I wish that were true.
876980	881460	So yeah, out of five questions, two of them were completely bloody wrong and one of them
881460	882940	was kind of half wrong.
882940	886220	So also when I was messing around, I asked it to give me directions to the closest roller
886220	889700	skating rink to where I live in East Dallas and it pointed me to a nice little skating
889700	894220	rink at the corner of Gus Thomason and Ferguson, but when I looked it up on Google, it's actually
894220	897020	way up in Plano about 10 miles away.
897020	902220	So yeah, when people ask me if I use chatGPT to write my scripts for me, my answer is not
902220	903700	just no, but hell no.
903700	907860	In fact, the first time I ever really tried to do that, I was doing a video on smart cities.
907860	910780	I tried to save a little time and asked it to write a few paragraphs about the planned
910780	914020	city of Tulosa, Arizona, and it gave me this.
914020	917500	Tulosa is a bustling metropolis located in the heart of the country with a population
917500	918500	of over 2 million people.
918500	922020	It's one of the largest cities in the nation and a major center of commerce, culture, and
922020	923020	entertainment.
923020	926700	The city is home to a diverse array of people with a rich mix of cultures, religions, and
926700	929780	backgrounds, making it a vibrant and exciting place to live and visit.
929780	933620	Tulosa is a cultural hotspot with numerous museums, galleries, and theaters showcasing
933620	937460	the best in art, music, and performance, and it's home to many renowned musical and
937460	940580	theater productions, as well as countless festivals and events that take place throughout
940580	941580	the year.
941580	947660	Yeah, um, this city does not exist.
947660	949740	It's literally just computer renderings right now.
949740	953940	Now I will say I've used it to help create video titles for my videos and it's been
953940	955140	pretty helpful with that.
955140	958660	And also, while I was testing it out, I thought I would try seeing if it could help me brainstorm
958660	961940	some ideas about a character that doesn't really exist.
961940	965420	Say I'm writing a book and I made up this character about a farmer who's about to go
965420	966420	bankrupt.
966420	969620	The prompt I gave it was, I'm writing a story featuring a character that's a farmer trying
969620	971420	to keep the family farm from going bankrupt.
971420	974140	He's a tough man struggling to keep himself together for his family.
974140	976100	What are some quirky characteristics I could give him?
976100	978540	And it gave me these options of superstitious.
978540	981740	Your farmer could have a collection of unusual, lucky charms or rituals that he believes will
982140	988260	bring good fortune to the farm, talks to animals, collects unusual items, expert whistler,
988260	994660	green thumb for unconventional plants, fear of modern technology, expert storyteller,
994660	996820	proclivity for inventing gadgets.
996820	997940	This is pretty good.
997940	1000100	Like, like that's seriously helpful.
1000100	1001460	I could actually use that.
1001460	1005980	Oh, and I also asked it to recite the to be or not to be speech in the style of Snoop Dogg.
1005980	1010340	Um, I was kind of hoping to see a to be or not to bizzle, but I didn't get that.
1010340	1012060	But I did get a matter of seconds.
1012060	1016500	It created a whole rap verse that's honestly pretty impressive.
1016500	1017500	Okay.
1017500	1019380	Now I am not a power user of chat GPT.
1019380	1022500	There's a million videos out there with great advice on how to create the best prompts to
1022500	1023500	get what you want.
1023500	1026140	I'll just direct you to some of those down in the description.
1026140	1030700	By the way, my prediction is that the word prompts is the word of the year for 2023.
1030700	1031700	Get used to that word.
1031700	1032700	You're going to be hearing it a lot.
1032700	1037060	So yeah, in my experience anyway, it works really well as a kind of springboard or brainstorming
1037060	1040220	partner, less well as a source of accurate information.
1040220	1041220	Yeah.
1041220	1044900	Ironically, the computer program is better at creative thought than accurate information,
1044900	1050500	which is fine, except, you know, Microsoft put it into being a search engine, a thing
1050500	1052980	people use to find accurate information.
1052980	1057220	And this is a problem as bombastic as the prognostications around AI have been to me
1057220	1058660	anyway.
1058660	1062980	This is a much more immediate threat the way AI could accelerate the already massive problem
1062980	1063980	misinformation online.
1063980	1067700	You know, I keep hearing about people using this as a shortcut to creating content online,
1067700	1068700	which is fine.
1068700	1072180	Like I just said, there's some really helpful use cases for that, but you have to fact check
1072180	1073180	it.
1073180	1075940	And frankly, a lot of people aren't going to do that because for many people, whether
1075940	1077420	or not it's accurate, it doesn't matter.
1077420	1079580	It's just about giving people something to click on.
1079580	1082700	Combine this with the rapid advancement of the image generating apps that are already
1082700	1087180	damn near photorealistic and we are truly entering a post-truth age when literally any
1087180	1091660	content can be faked, any image can be faked, any voice can be faked, I haven't even gotten
1091660	1092660	to that one yet.
1093020	1095780	And pretty soon, nobody's going to know what to believe anymore.
1095780	1098740	So they'll just believe whatever they want to believe.
1098740	1102940	Only increasing the fragmentation and distrust in our society, which is pretty god-awful
1102940	1103940	already.
1103940	1107740	Now the AI bros are quick to point out that this is the worst AI will ever be.
1107740	1109900	That it'll only get better from here.
1109900	1114100	But on the other hand, it'll only get better from here.
1114100	1118700	Now there are other LLMs being developed like Lambda from Meta and Bard from Google that
1118700	1120180	have not been released to the public.
1120180	1124140	People especially being extremely cautious about releasing Bard because, you know, their
1124140	1126740	entire reputation is based on their accuracy.
1126740	1130940	Some will say that Microsoft was actually being really risky putting chat GBT into Bing
1130940	1134900	so early, but let's be honest, nobody was using Bing so they really had nothing to lose.
1134900	1138740	But this does put pressure on Google to counter with their own search assistant and now we've
1138740	1140300	got an AI arms race.
1140300	1143620	But I guess, you know, maybe the upside is that there's only a handful of these LLMs
1143620	1146980	right now because they take literally billions of dollars to train them.
1147980	1150300	Only that's not true anymore.
1150300	1154260	Late last year researchers at Stanford announced a powerful LLM called Alpaca that could be
1154260	1157740	pre-trained for as little as $600.
1157740	1161540	They did it to create an LLM that academic institutions can test without, you know, needing
1161540	1163300	billions of dollars of funding.
1163300	1166260	According to their paper, it worked about as well as Meta's Lambda AI model.
1166260	1167380	It didn't stay up long though.
1167380	1171580	They took it down on March 20th because they were concerned about hallucinations.
1171580	1174340	That's what they call it when computers tell confident lies.
1174340	1176540	You know, like chat GBT does about half the time.
1176540	1177940	But the point had been made.
1177940	1181500	The price of LLMs is going down from billions of dollars to hundreds of dollars and pretty
1181500	1183860	soon people will be making these in their garages.
1183860	1188180	And since GPT-4, which hasn't been fully released to the public just yet, it has the ability
1188180	1189980	to write code.
1189980	1193540	So now you have the ability for AI to write more AI and improve it.
1193540	1196700	Anybody else feeling like this is kind of spiraling out of control?
1196700	1200060	It's no wonder that over a thousand tech insiders signed a letter in March to put a pause on
1200060	1202180	AI development beyond GPT-4.
1202180	1206420	That's from the Future of Life Institute, which is controversial in its own way.
1206420	1209020	And there's a heated debate around their intentions, which is a rabbit hole.
1209020	1211460	I'm just going to have to leave out of this video.
1211460	1214820	But even with the generative AI that's out right now, we've seen a flurry of app creation
1214820	1215820	using it.
1215820	1219580	Literally every other day, there's a new crazy world-changing app that makes the news.
1219580	1223260	Some of it's been the same AI marketing I was talking about before that's nothing new.
1223260	1225420	But some of it's just bonkers.
1225420	1230060	Things like mixo.io that create websites in minutes, jasper.ai that writes marketing
1230060	1232060	and SEO copy for the web.
1232140	1234860	luca.com that creates AI-generated logos.
1234860	1239140	tome.app that writes and creates presentations with Dolly and chat GPT.
1239140	1243940	quillbot.com that paraphrases AI paragraphs so it can pass an AI detector.
1243940	1245340	Yikes.
1245340	1248740	There's runway.ml, it's a video editor and image processor.
1248740	1252020	NVIDIA has an app that lets you draw a simple landscape and it'll just fill in the rest
1252020	1253340	they call that Canva.
1253340	1257420	NVIDIA also has a broadcasting app that will basically make your eyes look like it's going
1257420	1258980	in the direction of the camera.
1258980	1264220	There's 11labs.io that does voice cloning, sounddraw.io that makes music.
1264220	1267700	There's agent GPT that lets you build an AI agent that can do anything you can ask it
1267700	1268700	to do.
1268700	1273020	And there's futuretools.io which is an AI search engine for AI tools.
1273020	1275460	By the way, that's just a sample.
1275460	1279140	There are hundreds of these out there and there are other channels that have reviewed
1279140	1281060	literally hundreds of these apps.
1281060	1284100	Again, I'll just point you to those, there's gonna be a link downstairs.
1284100	1288940	Okay, so when it comes to these new AI tools, my personal theory is that they're just that.
1288940	1290300	They're tools, you know.
1290300	1293300	You still need to know what you're doing to get the kind of results that people are talking
1293300	1294300	about here.
1294300	1295300	You know, it's like Photoshop.
1295300	1298460	Just because you have Photoshop doesn't mean that you can do the same thing as a professional
1298460	1299580	designer can do.
1299580	1300660	I can attest to this.
1300660	1301860	I suck at Photoshop.
1301860	1305540	Actually, there's a great meme that's going around that anybody who's worked in a creative
1305540	1306540	field will understand.
1306540	1310700	It says, to replace creatives with AI, clients will need to be able to accurately describe
1310700	1312780	what they're looking for.
1312780	1313780	We're safe.
1313780	1314780	I'm sorry.
1314780	1317340	As somebody who's worked in that field, I can tell you that made me laugh quite a bit
1317340	1318340	when I first saw it.
1318380	1323300	But anyway, to test my theory, I actually dug in to about 10 or so of these apps, and I made
1323300	1327500	a whole separate video of it where I go through some of these apps, and I try to figure out
1327500	1332340	if I can make them work as a total noob in the way that the demos of these apps say they
1332340	1333340	can.
1333340	1336700	And I'm uploading this along with this video to Nebula, because I've just seen a ton of
1336700	1339540	these videos talking about these crazy things that these apps can do, but I've never actually
1339540	1343620	seen anybody actually use them, again, outside of those product demos.
1343620	1345540	So yeah, I gave it a try myself.
1345540	1350380	Some were garbage, but some I really think I might be using from now on, and trust me,
1350380	1353980	if a tech adult like me can do cool things with them, then they must be pretty powerful.
1353980	1356540	So if you're on Nebula, you can watch it right after this video.
1356540	1360420	If you're not on Nebula, well, here's why you should sign up for it.
1360420	1363360	Nebula is the premium streaming service that I help start along with some of my friends
1363360	1367860	who just happen to be some of the best educational YouTubers in the world, and I am completely
1367860	1369500	unbiased in that statement.
1369500	1372940	On Nebula, you can watch our videos ad-free and earlier than everywhere else, and you
1372940	1376580	can also see Nebula-exclusive videos that you can't find anywhere else, including Real
1376580	1381100	Engineering's Logistics of D-Day series, Real Science's unbelievably good series
1381100	1385020	called Becoming Human, and for those with a more big curiosity, you can find my Mysteries
1385020	1388140	of the Human Body series and my ongoing Forgotten atrocity series.
1388140	1391820	And something I don't talk about nearly enough is Nebula classes.
1391820	1395220	This is like some of those other online learning platforms that you may have heard of, but
1395220	1399820	these classes are run by educational YouTubers, just going full on educational.
1399820	1403020	You can learn how to produce videos like Volksgeist, how to produce music like Adam
1403020	1407500	Neely, and how to sue like a lawyer with LegalEagle, and there's new ones added all the time.
1407500	1412980	And the reason why we made this platform is because YouTube can be a lot.
1412980	1417040	With the ever-changing algorithm, the AI once again, we're always chasing the content
1417040	1420140	that will work here, and we're always having to be more click-bitty and sensational.
1420140	1423740	I know you guys hate that, but Nebula is a place where we can just let our hair down
1423740	1425340	and make the content that we care about.
1425340	1428740	So if you've ever thought about supporting a YouTuber, this is easily the biggest bang
1428740	1429740	for your buck.
1429740	1433180	Because not only are you supporting hundreds of content creators with that one subscription,
1433180	1434900	you get tons of content in return.
1434900	1438620	And if you sign up for the link below, you get that for 40% off the annual plan, which
1438620	1441260	comes out to a little bit over 250 a month.
1441260	1443980	Which is probably worth it just so you don't have to hear ad reads like this.
1443980	1446620	So click the link down in the description below to check it out and watch me test out
1446620	1450500	some of these AI apps, which I can tell you, if you were to test all these apps out yourself,
1450500	1453500	it would cost way more than your Nebula subscription.
1453500	1455220	So boom, you've already saved money.
1455220	1458660	All right, so to kind of wrap this thing up, I want to kind of talk about some of the issues
1458660	1462700	that really need to be mentioned, because so much of this topic gets overwhelmed by
1462700	1464860	the existential dread stuff.
1464860	1469140	And while I know that's kind of my thing, there are some right here right now problems
1469140	1470820	that are far more immediate threats.
1470820	1475060	Obviously, there's issues of jobs being lost to AI, and yeah, this is something to be concerned
1475060	1476060	about.
1476060	1479420	But there's also a bit of a debate around this, because one could also make the argument
1479420	1482740	that these new tools could help employees be more productive and more creative.
1482740	1486340	Yeah, there's another line that tech bros tend to say, which is your job isn't going
1486340	1490380	to be replaced by AI, it's going to be replaced by somebody else using AI.
1490380	1493220	And there's a couple of things that I can point to as perfect examples of that.
1493220	1499380	So Corridor crew did this all AI animation called Rock, Paper, Scissors, which is incredible.
1499380	1503860	And also a TikTok creator called Ghostwriter977 made a lot of news recently because he made
1503860	1510540	a song called Heart on My Sleeve that used Drake's voice in the song, but it was AI-generated.
1510540	1513580	And it was so good that it got taken down by Drake's people.
1513580	1517380	And the point there is that, yeah, these guys were able to do amazing things, but these
1517380	1519420	are extremely talented people.
1519420	1523740	I mean, you can look at Corridor crew's YouTube page, I mean, they make insane stuff all the
1523740	1524740	time.
1524740	1526460	This is just a new tool they've been able to use.
1526460	1529820	I mean, going back to Photoshop, when it came out, I remember a lot of people were worried
1529820	1534140	that it was going to put photographers and illustrators out of business, but most professionals
1534140	1537860	just kind of adapted to it and just started using it and made better stuff than they'd
1537860	1539380	ever made before in their lives.
1539380	1543740	I personally do know a few artists that are actually embracing Dolly in mid-journey.
1543740	1546100	Mostly it's just kind of jumping off points to kind of spark new ideas.
1546100	1549700	And as a writer, as I showed a minute ago with some of the brainstorming ideas, like
1549700	1552580	this is a really quick and easy way to push through writer's blog.
1552580	1557380	I do worry a bit that this could kind of become an Uroboros, like a snake eating its own tail
1557380	1561900	because if people use these AIs to create online content and then the AI pulls from
1561900	1566700	that online content to make new content, it just becomes an endless cycle.
1566700	1570260	There is also the whole debate around the fact that AI is using other people's work
1570260	1574820	as part of that large language model and stuff, all of which is copyrighted material
1574820	1578260	and a lot of people are up in arms about that, and I think understandably so.
1578260	1584020	But also at the same time, again, playing devil's advocate, it's not completely copying
1584020	1585020	it.
1585020	1588060	It's kind of using it as an inspiration, which we all do that, don't we?
1588060	1593500	It's like it also just made the news recently that Ed Sheeran had been sued for possibly
1593500	1599220	copying the court progression from the song Let's Get It On, but a lot of pop songs use
1599220	1600220	the same court progressions.
1600220	1604020	In fact, there were songs before Let's Get It On that used that same court progression,
1604020	1606300	which is why Ed Sheeran won his lawsuit.
1606300	1609860	So this is an ongoing debate around art that started long before AI.
1609860	1614220	It'll be going on long after, but AI does make it a bit more complicated.
1614220	1619700	Now the pessimist in me does worry that the money people see AI as a cheap or even free
1619700	1623860	content creator, and that it'll squeeze creative jobs out of existence.
1623860	1628300	But the optimist in me thinks that humans working with AI could unleash even more mind
1628300	1632660	bending ideas and that eventually the cream will rise to the top, just like all the tools
1632660	1633660	from the past did.
1633660	1637380	Now in fact, as I'm recording this, we'll see if this is still going on when the video
1637380	1641340	comes out, the WGA is striking in Hollywood.
1641340	1644740	Part of that is about streaming services and not getting paid well for the streaming services,
1644740	1648580	but a big part of the argument, a big part of why they're striking right now has to
1648580	1649580	do with AI.
1649580	1653980	And I want to just point out a thread that Justine Bateman shared on Twitter, where
1653980	1657140	she was talking about some of the big issues and things that we can expect to be happening
1657140	1661940	in the near future with AI for some of the things that they're trying to get ahead of.
1661940	1665260	She starts by pointing out that she is actually a coder and she has a computer science degree,
1665260	1667260	so she does know a bit of what she's talking about here.
1667260	1671140	She points out that AI written scripts and digitally scanned actors already exist.
1671140	1675580	And actually Bruce Willis made news for signing over his AI rights to his likeness.
1675580	1679780	This kind of started happening when he came when he was diagnosed with aphasia and couldn't
1679780	1680900	really perform anymore.
1680900	1685540	He sold his AI rights so that people could continue to make movies with him in the distant
1685540	1686540	future.
1686540	1689700	She points out that in that case, your digital image can be triple and quadruple booked,
1689700	1693580	so an actor could actually be working multiple projects at the same time.
1693580	1697620	She suggested in the future that films could be customized for the viewer, meaning people
1697620	1701460	could just special order a movie if they wanted to.
1701460	1705100	She uses the example of, I want to film about a panda in a unicorn who saved the world in
1705100	1708700	a rocket ship and put Bill Murray in it, so you could be watching whatever streaming service
1708700	1712300	they might offer something where you could just give a text prompt and it will just create
1712300	1715380	a movie as you wanted to see it.
1715380	1719740	Which Bill Murray with a panda in a unicorn saving the world in a rocket ship just sounds
1719740	1722140	like a Wes Anderson movie.
1722140	1725900	Which actually I'm pretty sure that Wes Anderson at this point is just an AI that's been pre-trained
1725900	1727780	on Wes Anderson movies.
1727780	1731620	She points out the possibility of people getting themselves scanned and putting themselves
1731620	1734820	into films so like you could put your own face on Darth Vader.
1734820	1738580	She said you could train an AI program on a series and then just create a whole new
1738580	1740460	season of that series.
1740460	1745660	And that brings up some really interesting possibilities but my big question is, is that
1745660	1746660	something people want?
1746660	1749700	I mean, would you want to see that?
1749700	1753900	Like there are already programs like Nothing Forever, which is a never ending AI generated
1753900	1756020	Seinfeld episode.
1756020	1763140	I mean, who isn't crazy these days?
1763140	1766700	This is terrible, but it will get better.
1766700	1771020	And actually the Nothing Forever thing, it's streaming on Twitch, they took it down because
1771020	1774900	it started using homophobic slurs.
1774900	1775900	So there's that.
1775900	1780500	Yeah, you know, computers doing all the creative stuff while people keep working in factories
1780500	1784020	for lower and lower paying jobs is not the future I was hoping for.
1784020	1788700	Now as for administrative and legal jobs and whatnot that's under threat by AI, that
1788700	1790300	I don't think is anything new.
1790300	1792460	I don't mean to minimize that as a threat.
1792460	1796220	It definitely is to a lot of people, but that's a trend that's been going on for quite some
1796220	1797220	time now.
1797220	1800460	And again, I think the more familiar you are with these tools, the safer your job's going
1800460	1803420	to be, but there are a lot of takes on that subject.
1803420	1808580	Now one area of AI that did put me on my heels is that of AI and warfare.
1808580	1812580	I talked a little bit about AI in my episode on the future of war, but that's a debate
1812580	1814380	that's only getting bigger and more confusing.
1814380	1818540	AI gets used in a lot of ways by the military from image processing to logistics, but what
1818540	1823060	about AI's having the power to decide if a person lives or dies?
1823060	1826780	Like just the fact that, you know, drones were conducting strikes controlled by an operator
1826780	1830580	hundreds of miles away, like that was iffy at the time when that started being a thing.
1830580	1834540	But now the debate is whether or not an AI should be allowed to make that decision.
1834540	1838700	But even bigger than that, way bigger than that, is that increasingly there's been talk
1838700	1841100	about giving AI the ability to launch nuclear weapons.
1841100	1845060	I think I need a lighting change.
1845060	1849060	So back in the 80s, the Soviets instituted a dead hand mechanism on their nuclear arsenal.
1849060	1852620	This was in the event that, you know, decision makers might get wiped out in a nuclear strike
1852620	1856340	on Moscow, it would automatically trigger all their nukes to fire at the U.S.
1856340	1860420	Now you could say this was kind of an early algorithm or automation of the nuclear arsenal.
1860420	1864180	And similarly, the U.S. has contingencies in place in the event of a first strike scenario,
1864740	1868780	but that time horizon on first strike has gotten smaller and smaller over the years.
1868780	1871380	First ICBMs could reach the U.S. in about 30 minutes.
1871380	1873820	The nuclear submarines cut that time in half.
1873820	1877460	Today we're seeing the birth of hypersonic missiles that could cut that in half yet again.
1877460	1881820	So now in a nuclear scenario, military leaders may have less than seven minutes to make a
1881820	1884060	decision and retaliate.
1884060	1888100	And that's led many to consider handing those decisions over to AI to save precious seconds.
1888100	1893500	So when we talk about an AI arms race, this is the ultimate version of that.
1893500	1898580	We could see a day in the very near future where the U.S., China, and Russia all had their
1898580	1900380	nuclear arsenals controlled by AI.
1900380	1908060	AI that we don't fully understand or control with the ability to wipe out all life on Earth.
1908060	1911860	Anyway, just something to think about.
1911860	1916820	Ultimately, I think what we're dealing with here really is just an amplifier.
1916820	1920220	It's a highly evolving set of tools that can make production more productive, create
1920220	1925420	as more creative, bad actors and the worst actors, scammers more successful, and weapons
1925420	1926420	more deadly.
1926420	1930620	It's the Wild West right now, and we really don't know where this goes.
1930620	1933820	And I can hear all the comments already of people saying, you forgot about this, you forgot
1933820	1934820	about that.
1934820	1938340	Yeah, there's a lot that I left out of this video because it's just too much.
1938340	1943700	This is already way too long of a video, and writing this kind of broke my brain.
1943700	1947500	The whole thing just gives me like a grandma migraine headache.
1947500	1952060	Like not here or here so much, but like right here.
1952060	1955620	So any one of the topics that I brought up here and any of the things that I left out
1955620	1958820	for that matter could be entire videos of their own.
1958820	1962700	So yeah, if this video does well and you guys want to see a video on any of those topics,
1962700	1963700	let me know.
1963700	1964700	Maybe I'll do them.
1964700	1967380	And also, there's a ton of videos and creators doing great work on this topic.
1967380	1970380	Again, I'm going to put links down in the description so you guys can go check it out.
1970380	1974620	I encourage you to do so because we got to stay on top of this.
1974620	1975620	The genie's out of the bottle.
1975980	1979820	But I think I'll leave things off with a quote from Jeffrey Hinton, who's often called
1979820	1980820	the godfather of AI.
1980820	1983860	He's been working on AI in neural nets since the 80s.
1983860	1985660	And he was working with Google until recently.
1985660	1989980	He actually, he left Google so that he could speak freely about this subject.
1989980	1992380	He recently said this in an interview with CBS.
1992380	1997980	This is the biggest technological advancement since, is this another industrial revolution?
1997980	1998980	What is this?
1998980	2000300	How should people think of it?
2000300	2004860	I think it's comparable in scale with the industrial revolution or electricity.
2005580	2007580	Or maybe the wheel.
2007580	2009580	Or maybe the wheel.
2009580	2010580	Yeah.
2010580	2012580	That was earlier.
2012580	2013580	Yeah.
2013580	2014580	Okay.
2014580	2015580	So buckle up.
2015580	2016580	Yeah.
2016580	2017580	All right.
