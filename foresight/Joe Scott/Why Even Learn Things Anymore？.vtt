00:00.000 --> 00:14.760
In the movie Idiocracy, Mike Judge imagines a world where the stupid inherit the Earth.

00:14.760 --> 00:18.640
In this scenario, it's because the smoother brain types procreated recklessly while the

00:18.640 --> 00:23.360
sensible practical PhD types planned and waited for the right time to have a kid, a right

00:23.360 --> 00:27.320
time which never came, leading the dumb to simply outreproduce the smart.

00:27.320 --> 00:31.560
So the world was a crumbling husk of deteriorating infrastructure, toppled buildings, and dead

00:31.560 --> 00:33.680
crops watered with electrolytes.

00:33.680 --> 00:36.880
It's become something of a meme in recent years to say that this movie belongs in the

00:36.880 --> 00:42.360
documentary category, what with the world kind of feeling especially stupid lately.

00:42.360 --> 00:46.880
But while Judge's premise for how the world got to be this stupid is maybe a bit flawed

00:46.880 --> 00:51.920
and smacks of eugenics a bit, it does speak to a potential great filter that might threaten

00:51.920 --> 00:53.240
advanced civilizations.

00:54.200 --> 00:57.880
The civilization's technology outsmarts the civilization.

00:57.880 --> 01:02.040
This is usually depicted as a judgement day scenario, where the computers and the robots

01:02.040 --> 01:06.800
turn sentient and revolt against the humans, forcing them into servitude, or simply eliminating

01:06.800 --> 01:09.720
them entirely before turning the universe into papercliffs.

01:09.720 --> 01:15.000
But that's not how civilizations fall, it's rarely overnight, it's usually long and drawn

01:15.000 --> 01:20.040
out and regardless of external forces, usually made possible by neglect from within.

01:20.040 --> 01:24.280
Meaning if our technology overtakes us it likely won't just be because they got smarter,

01:24.280 --> 01:28.440
but because we also got, well, dumber.

01:28.440 --> 01:31.640
Here in the United States we just finished another school year and the kids are off for

01:31.640 --> 01:35.080
summer, or whatever passes for summer these days.

01:35.080 --> 01:39.480
These are kids that were raised with an iPad in their faces, digital natives for whom the

01:39.480 --> 01:43.800
ability to access all the world's knowledge with just a couple of taps is second nature.

01:43.800 --> 01:47.320
They can't imagine a world where the answer to any question they might have can't be

01:47.320 --> 01:49.320
found right in their pocket.

01:49.320 --> 01:54.560
And yet they go to a school every day, usually at ridiculously early hours, and have the

01:54.560 --> 01:58.840
greatest source of information the world has ever seen taken away from them, and told

01:58.840 --> 02:02.800
that they need to just remember things and read books.

02:02.800 --> 02:08.720
I imagine this must be a very bizarre concept to them, you know, memory and computing.

02:08.720 --> 02:14.000
This is a solved problem, it's all just out there, in the ether, in the cloud if you will.

02:14.000 --> 02:17.320
Like there's no way that they could retain as much information in their heads as they

02:17.320 --> 02:19.800
could hold in their hand in any given moment of the day.

02:19.800 --> 02:22.640
Like what a step backward this must feel like.

02:22.640 --> 02:27.240
And not to even mention that by the time they graduate, AI technology and robotics will advance

02:27.240 --> 02:30.600
to the point that there'll be very few jobs for them to do.

02:30.600 --> 02:35.360
So I'm sure the question gets asked all the time, why even learn things anymore?

02:35.360 --> 02:37.520
It's kind of a valid question.

02:40.520 --> 02:44.040
Now before I make the argument that the education system is going to have to fundamentally change

02:44.040 --> 02:48.040
in the next coming decade, I should probably start by pointing out that the current education

02:48.040 --> 02:53.360
system, the way we've been doing it our whole lives, it's not very old.

02:53.360 --> 02:57.680
The whole idea of compulsory school, of making sure that everybody has like a baseline level

02:57.680 --> 03:03.600
of education, that is a very, very new concept in the grand scheme of things.

03:03.600 --> 03:07.720
For most of human history, education took the form of apprenticeships, where people

03:07.720 --> 03:12.160
would learn a skill or trade by working underneath a master of that trade.

03:12.160 --> 03:15.760
And that was if you were lucky, most people just toiled in the fields and rolled around

03:15.760 --> 03:16.760
in the mud.

03:16.760 --> 03:20.720
But even if you did become an apprentice, you learned how to perform that trade.

03:20.720 --> 03:24.040
Maybe some business and financial stuff around it, but you didn't learn much outside of

03:24.040 --> 03:25.040
that.

03:25.040 --> 03:28.080
You just didn't need to.

03:28.080 --> 03:35.400
Yeah, blacksmiths, farmers, weavers, millers, miners, woodworkers, architects, doctors,

03:35.400 --> 03:36.400
inscribes.

03:36.400 --> 03:40.640
Like, the whole role of the scribes was to capture and share information, and because

03:40.640 --> 03:43.600
of that, they were pretty much the only people that knew how to read.

03:43.600 --> 03:45.920
Even most kings couldn't read back then.

03:45.920 --> 03:50.640
They had all their correspondence, you know, taken down and read to them by their scribes.

03:50.640 --> 03:54.720
And as time went on, you know, literacy became a bit more of a status symbol amongst the

03:54.720 --> 03:55.720
royals and the nobility.

03:55.720 --> 04:00.400
It was a class thing, so, you know, institutions of higher learning became a thing after that.

04:00.400 --> 04:04.560
But it would take hundreds of years for the idea of general schooling for everyone to

04:04.560 --> 04:05.560
become a thing.

04:05.560 --> 04:09.560
I bring all this up because it's starting to feel a little bit full circle when you

04:09.560 --> 04:10.560
think about it.

04:10.560 --> 04:14.960
Because once upon a time, we offloaded the maintenance of knowledge to a privileged

04:14.960 --> 04:19.000
class of people, and now we're starting to do it again.

04:19.000 --> 04:20.000
To technology.

04:20.000 --> 04:23.640
You know, we used to not learn things because that knowledge was irrelevant to us.

04:23.640 --> 04:26.040
Now we don't learn things because it's ubiquitous.

04:26.040 --> 04:28.840
Like knowledge used to be power, now it's everywhere.

04:28.840 --> 04:32.640
Now, some might argue that the purpose of school was never really about educating the

04:32.640 --> 04:33.640
population.

04:33.640 --> 04:35.840
It was about creating skilled workers.

04:35.840 --> 04:38.640
It's about having people just smart enough so they can work the machines to keep the

04:38.640 --> 04:43.480
economy going, or to make weapons to make our enemies go all-explode-y.

04:43.480 --> 04:45.560
But even that is increasingly under threat.

04:45.560 --> 04:50.160
Like robots have been encroaching into our factories and warehouses for decades, but

04:50.160 --> 04:55.480
now we're starting to see, along with an explosion of AI, an explosion of humanoid robots that

04:55.480 --> 04:59.600
are designed to be easily trainable to do anything we can do.

04:59.600 --> 05:03.320
We'll talk more about that later, but what we're seeing right now is both knowledge

05:03.320 --> 05:07.680
jobs and manual labor jobs facing major disruptions at the same time.

05:07.680 --> 05:12.680
So if you're a kid in school, or maybe an adult who wants to go back to school, what

05:12.680 --> 05:14.880
exactly are you supposed to do?

05:14.880 --> 05:16.320
How do you prepare for this?

05:16.320 --> 05:20.800
We're facing a literally unprecedented situation, where really the only place to look for any

05:20.800 --> 05:22.560
kind of guidance is science fiction.

05:22.560 --> 05:25.520
Returning to our original premise, let's look at the movie Idiocracy.

05:25.520 --> 05:28.840
Just in case you haven't seen the movie, the main gist is that our main character, who

05:28.840 --> 05:33.560
happens to be named Joe, gets frozen and then kind of accidentally forgotten, and he

05:33.560 --> 05:37.680
winds up waking up in the year 2505, so 500 years in the future.

05:37.680 --> 05:42.600
And when he wakes up, it turns out that the average IQ has fallen so much that he is now

05:42.600 --> 05:44.280
the smartest person in the world.

05:44.280 --> 05:47.880
His character, by the way, he was in the army and he was chosen for this experiment specifically

05:47.880 --> 05:51.560
because he was basically the most average person in the world.

05:51.560 --> 05:55.200
So yeah, average Joe, who is now not so average.

05:55.200 --> 05:58.840
So the movie spends a lot of time portraying a world where everybody's gotten so dumb

05:58.840 --> 06:02.000
that nobody can run the machines or the computers anymore.

06:02.000 --> 06:06.440
Long as a dystopian mess, and it's just kind of basically a big send up of popular culture,

06:06.440 --> 06:10.640
kind of a reductio ad absurdum statement on how dumb our society is today.

06:10.640 --> 06:15.640
What they don't spend a lot of time on is explaining how the economy works in this scenario.

06:15.640 --> 06:20.040
People do have jobs, Dax Shepard's character is a lawyer, and a terrible one.

06:20.040 --> 06:25.480
There are hospitals and police and baristas at Starbucks that provide a little happy ending

06:25.480 --> 06:26.480
with their caffeine.

06:26.480 --> 06:31.840
Don't get me started on the waitstaff at Thudruckers, or what it becomes.

06:31.840 --> 06:33.800
So people do work, and they're obsessed with money.

06:33.800 --> 06:37.640
So it seems like in this world, they didn't quite come up with the AI and robotics technology

06:37.640 --> 06:39.280
to put everybody out of work.

06:39.280 --> 06:42.840
It does seem to be based on a capitalist system where people have to work for money.

06:42.840 --> 06:46.440
And somehow the company stays afloat even though everyone's incompetent.

06:46.440 --> 06:50.280
In fact, the only part of the movie that really gives any kind of a hint into what the economy

06:50.280 --> 06:56.720
looks like in the world of idiocracy is when Joe, as the smartest person in the world,

06:56.720 --> 06:59.120
convinces them to use water on their crops.

06:59.120 --> 07:02.880
So again, for anybody who hasn't seen the movie, there's a company called Brando that

07:02.880 --> 07:06.560
makes this energy drink that's kind of like, I don't know, it's like a mix between Gatorade

07:06.560 --> 07:10.240
and Monster Energy drink, and it's what everybody drinks all the time.

07:10.240 --> 07:14.920
And they've been drinking it for so long that in fact, when Joe asks for some water to drink,

07:14.920 --> 07:18.460
they all look at him like he's crazy because water is what you put in the toilet.

07:18.460 --> 07:21.320
In fact, they bought into the whole Brando thing so much that they use it to water their

07:21.320 --> 07:27.400
crops, and they do so because according to their marketing, it has electrolytes, which

07:27.400 --> 07:29.000
is what plants crave.

07:29.000 --> 07:31.040
But Brando's got what plants crave.

07:31.040 --> 07:32.480
It's got electrolytes.

07:32.480 --> 07:33.480
What are electrolytes?

07:33.480 --> 07:35.040
Do you even know?

07:35.040 --> 07:37.680
It's what they used to make Brando.

07:37.680 --> 07:40.680
Yeah, but why did they use them to make Brando?

07:40.680 --> 07:42.880
Because Brando's got electrolytes.

07:42.880 --> 07:46.760
Anyway, it turns out the electrolytes in Brando was building up in the soil and killing the

07:46.760 --> 07:51.000
plants and was threatening a famine, so he convinces them to use water instead.

07:51.000 --> 07:55.520
And this turns out to be disastrous because it causes Brando's stock to go down and they

07:55.520 --> 08:00.120
wind up firing everybody, which is a problem because apparently, literally, everybody works

08:00.120 --> 08:01.120
for Brando.

08:01.120 --> 08:04.800
So it's depicted as an inevitable future where one corporation runs the world and everybody

08:04.800 --> 08:06.280
works for that one company.

08:06.280 --> 08:08.120
And this is similar to the movie WALL-E.

08:08.120 --> 08:12.520
In WALL-E, the world is run by one company called the Buy-In-Large Corporation, who have

08:12.520 --> 08:16.720
completely trashed the planet, leading humans to escape to giant luxury liners in space,

08:16.720 --> 08:18.640
the mainship being called the Axiom.

08:18.640 --> 08:22.840
In this world, humans have basically become nothing more than consumers.

08:22.840 --> 08:24.720
Their infants, really, is what it comes down to.

08:24.720 --> 08:27.880
They sit in floating recliners all day long with a screen in front of their faces, just

08:27.880 --> 08:32.080
like the mobiles that hang over babies' cribs and whatnot.

08:32.080 --> 08:37.280
They just consume entertainment all day long and buy things off of the endlessly personalized

08:37.280 --> 08:39.480
ads, which are obviously inspired by social media.

08:39.480 --> 08:44.520
Now, there is some debate around exactly how the economy works on the Axiom because everything

08:44.520 --> 08:46.320
on the ship is automated.

08:46.320 --> 08:50.880
Robots perform all the necessary labor and whatnot, but people aren't just given everything.

08:50.880 --> 08:53.720
They seem to have to pay for it with ship credits.

08:53.720 --> 08:56.600
Now, how they accrue these ship credits, I'm not sure.

08:56.600 --> 09:00.880
I don't know exactly what you would call a system like this, but a user on Stack Exchange

09:00.880 --> 09:03.400
put it like this, and I think it explains it pretty well.

09:03.400 --> 09:07.960
It has aspects of post-scarcity combined with basic income of some sort, but it's not socialist

09:07.960 --> 09:10.800
communists as there is a sense of property ownership.

09:10.800 --> 09:13.720
The resources aren't communally managed and there is no labor involved.

09:13.720 --> 09:17.360
Now, the Jetsons have an interesting take on this, and I've always pointed to the Jetsons

09:17.360 --> 09:21.840
whenever we talk about, like, robots taking over all the jobs and stuff like that because,

09:21.840 --> 09:25.920
you know, we all want to live in the Jetsons world, but nobody wants to make the changes

09:25.920 --> 09:28.240
that would be necessary to live in that world.

09:28.240 --> 09:33.280
By the way, quick aside, the Jetsons came out in 1962, literally like just a few weeks

09:33.280 --> 09:38.240
after Kennedy announced the goal of landing on the moon, which I find crazy.

09:38.240 --> 09:42.120
The Jetsons were basically a future version of the Flintstones, and it only ran for one

09:42.120 --> 09:47.560
season, 1962 to 1963, with a brief revival in 1980.

09:47.560 --> 09:49.040
The old Nostalgia Circuit.

09:49.240 --> 09:52.880
Also, and I'll get to the point here in a second, I'm also blown away that of all

09:52.880 --> 09:56.520
the live-action remakes of animated movies that we've seen over the years, I cannot

09:56.520 --> 09:58.680
believe they've never done the Jetsons.

09:58.680 --> 10:01.360
Seriously, how cool would that be?

10:01.360 --> 10:05.600
The Jetsons features a family consisting of George Jetson, Jane his wife, daughter Judy,

10:05.600 --> 10:08.600
and his boy, Elroy, and their dog, Astro.

10:08.600 --> 10:11.560
It's basically just designed to pipe a bunch of bad space buns into our heads.

10:11.560 --> 10:16.160
Now, being that this was conceived in the early 60s, the social dynamics are a bit outdated.

10:16.160 --> 10:18.440
Women drivers, that's the problem.

10:18.440 --> 10:20.920
You know what you need is a wife to do your cooking.

10:20.920 --> 10:25.080
So yeah, George flies into his job every day at Spacely Sprockets while his wife tends

10:25.080 --> 10:27.520
to the home and, you know, spends all his money.

10:27.520 --> 10:30.480
Although she doesn't have to do a lot of tending to her home because they have a robot

10:30.480 --> 10:32.520
housekeeper named Rosie that does most of the housework.

10:32.520 --> 10:36.320
So yeah, George still commutes to work every day and struggles to find parking, even though

10:36.320 --> 10:38.560
his car folds up into a briefcase.

10:38.560 --> 10:42.960
They couldn't conceive of remote work back then, even though they do have a video phone.

10:42.960 --> 10:44.600
So in this world, people still have to work.

10:44.600 --> 10:49.480
But George only has to work a few hours a day, which sounds great, but he's apparently

10:49.480 --> 10:52.960
pretty miserable in this job because, you know, a trope of the time was this hard ass

10:52.960 --> 10:55.320
boss always on his case, threatening to fire him.

10:55.320 --> 10:58.800
So robots do most of the heavy lifting in this world and human work is basically just

10:58.800 --> 11:00.000
involves pressing buttons.

11:00.000 --> 11:04.000
But it still upholds the standard of the 60s with the nuclear family and the father being

11:04.000 --> 11:05.000
the lone breadwinner.

11:05.000 --> 11:07.960
And even though he only works a few hours a day, he's able to support a whole family

11:07.960 --> 11:10.320
and live a middle class existence.

11:10.320 --> 11:13.960
So while it's never really explained in detail, probably because they were too busy

11:13.960 --> 11:18.160
coming up with space puns, one can assume that in this scenario, George gets some percentage

11:18.160 --> 11:20.280
of the robots productivity shared with him.

11:20.280 --> 11:23.880
This imagines a world where the company uses robots to do all the labor and then the spoils

11:23.880 --> 11:25.720
of that labor are shared with the employees.

11:25.720 --> 11:29.160
I may be talking out of my butt here, but I kind of feel like this points to the ethos

11:29.160 --> 11:33.680
of the post-war era where people were expected to get a job and stay there for all their

11:33.680 --> 11:38.960
working years and build up a pension that they can later retire off of.

11:38.960 --> 11:42.560
I feel like there used to be more of a sense of shared responsibility between the employer

11:42.560 --> 11:45.240
and the employee back then, but I wasn't around back then.

11:45.240 --> 11:50.320
So again, I may be pulling an ace ventura here, but when I say that this is a future

11:50.320 --> 11:54.640
that everybody wants, but nobody wants to make happen, what I mean is like people have

11:54.640 --> 11:57.800
been saying for decades now that automation is a good thing because it makes each person

11:57.800 --> 11:59.600
far more productive.

11:59.600 --> 12:03.800
But that's only a good thing when that person gets a share of the profits from that productivity.

12:03.800 --> 12:07.880
You know, otherwise it's just a cost saving measure from the company and people wind up

12:07.880 --> 12:12.520
losing their jobs, which is pretty much what actually happens in reality, because ultimately

12:12.520 --> 12:17.280
companies are more beholden to their shareholders than they are to their employees in our world.

12:17.280 --> 12:21.760
And exactly how they make this work in the fictional cartoon world of the Jetsons, I'm

12:21.760 --> 12:26.400
not sure, but we've only got 38 years to figure it out because the Jetsons takes place

12:26.400 --> 12:27.400
in the year 2062.

12:27.400 --> 12:32.680
But maybe the most obvious depiction of a post-scarcity society in science fiction is, of course,

12:32.680 --> 12:33.680
Star Trek.

12:33.680 --> 12:37.240
There's an entire book on this called Trekonomics, which I have not read, but I encourage you

12:37.240 --> 12:39.760
to check it out if you're interested in this whole thing.

12:39.760 --> 12:44.880
But in Star Trek, the whole system of people working to produce things that people can

12:44.880 --> 12:50.680
buy, I'll stop that now, that's all totally out the window because they've got the replicator.

12:50.680 --> 12:53.760
If you happen to have been living under a rock this whole time and have no idea what

12:53.760 --> 12:59.920
a replicator is, it's kind of like a molecular 3D printer that can just basically make whatever

12:59.920 --> 13:00.920
you want.

13:00.920 --> 13:05.720
In Star Trek, the governing body, the United Federation of Planets, they do away with currency

13:05.720 --> 13:06.960
completely.

13:06.960 --> 13:10.760
People don't work so that they can make money to keep a roof over their heads, but they

13:10.760 --> 13:13.440
do work for a civilization that has no money.

13:13.440 --> 13:15.440
People seem really busy.

13:15.440 --> 13:19.160
But in Star Trek lore, people don't work for money to acquire wealth.

13:19.160 --> 13:24.040
They work to feel a sense of purpose, as Picard explains in Star Trek First Contact.

13:24.040 --> 13:28.240
The economics of the future are somewhat different.

13:28.240 --> 13:33.000
You see, money doesn't exist in the 24th century.

13:33.000 --> 13:34.000
No money.

13:34.000 --> 13:36.680
You mean you don't get paid?

13:36.680 --> 13:42.360
The acquisition of wealth is no longer the driving force in our lives.

13:42.360 --> 13:47.680
We work to better ourselves and the rest of humanity.

13:47.680 --> 13:49.080
This sounds great.

13:49.080 --> 13:52.440
Also, uh, naive.

13:52.440 --> 13:55.720
Like in the other examples that I just listed, the focus is really more on the system in

13:55.720 --> 13:57.880
place that accommodates for full automation.

13:57.880 --> 14:03.480
But in Star Trek, I don't know, it seems to require a much deeper transformation, like

14:03.480 --> 14:07.920
effectively turning off everyone's natural instinct to consume and hoard.

14:07.920 --> 14:13.360
Like in Wally, people are just turned into consumers, but in Star Trek, consuming is

14:13.360 --> 14:14.360
not a thing.

14:14.360 --> 14:19.960
Yeah, in Star Trek, that natural human ambition that's basically led us to wreck the planet

14:19.960 --> 14:20.960
so far.

14:20.960 --> 14:25.440
That's been turned away from material possessions and wealth and toward personal fulfillment.

14:25.440 --> 14:28.640
Value is placed on meaning and purpose instead of external things.

14:28.640 --> 14:33.360
Which again, that sounds wonderful and, I mean, I don't know, maybe in a system where

14:33.360 --> 14:37.240
literally anything that you could possibly want could be created with the push of a button.

14:37.240 --> 14:41.920
Maybe the whole concept of wealth falls apart and that natural drive for purpose pushes

14:41.920 --> 14:44.280
people inward.

14:44.280 --> 14:46.000
Maybe it's just a natural consequence of that.

14:46.000 --> 14:50.040
But there is also something kind of yikesy about a society where everyone's natural impulses

14:50.040 --> 14:54.800
have been, you know, rewired or redirected in the way that the state deems appropriate.

14:54.800 --> 14:58.920
In fact, you could argue that the Borg is kind of like the flip side of that post-scare

14:58.920 --> 15:02.760
city coin, you know, when that sort of collective thought is taken to the extreme.

15:02.760 --> 15:06.600
Now, I know many of you are Star Trek fans and there is a lot of lore in this universe

15:06.600 --> 15:07.600
that I'm leaving out.

15:07.600 --> 15:12.640
So yeah, anything that I missed or anybody that thinks that I'm wrong, just go school

15:12.640 --> 15:13.640
me in the comments.

15:13.640 --> 15:19.160
But yeah, however you slice it, that sort of Star Trek collectivist utopia seems impossibly

15:19.160 --> 15:20.920
far away considering where we're starting from.

15:20.920 --> 15:25.360
I mean, unless we have a complete and total breakdown of society and have to, you know,

15:25.360 --> 15:26.960
rebuild everything from scratch.

15:26.960 --> 15:32.920
Also, there would need to be some technology to happen so that replicators could be a thing.

15:32.920 --> 15:37.040
Because right now we seem to be more heading toward the whole one or two corporations running

15:37.040 --> 15:38.040
everything model.

15:38.040 --> 15:41.760
Whether that turns out to be more like Wally or idiocracy remains to be seen, but we better

15:41.760 --> 15:46.880
start thinking about it because it's about to get real.

15:49.160 --> 16:09.920
Yep, the robots are coming.

16:09.920 --> 16:11.400
So we've all heard about the Tesla bot.

16:11.400 --> 16:15.600
We've seen the acrobatics of Boston Dynamics Atlas robot, but these machines are progressing

16:15.600 --> 16:16.600
fast.

16:16.600 --> 16:20.640
So I did a video a while back about humanoid robots and why it's a different thing from

16:20.640 --> 16:24.720
the kind of robots that have been used in manufacturing and stuff for a long time.

16:24.720 --> 16:29.280
I was personally questioning like why humanoid robots would exist at all, like why do we

16:29.280 --> 16:32.200
assume that the human form is the perfect form?

16:32.200 --> 16:36.120
And you can go watch that video to see what the entire argument turns out to be, but what

16:36.120 --> 16:40.320
it basically boils down to is that it's not necessarily that a humanoid robot is a higher

16:40.320 --> 16:44.480
performing robot than say, you know, an assembly line kind of robot.

16:44.480 --> 16:50.920
It's just that we live in a world that is designed for this form factor, basically.

16:50.920 --> 16:57.120
So the humanoid robot is basically designed to function in a world that has been designed

16:57.120 --> 16:58.960
around what we look like.

16:58.960 --> 17:02.640
So if there's any kind of robot that's going to wind up taking over human jobs, it's one

17:02.640 --> 17:05.360
that works and functions like we do.

17:05.360 --> 17:08.180
And there's a lot of interesting humanoid robots on the way.

17:08.180 --> 17:10.200
We can start with the Atlas robot.

17:10.200 --> 17:14.200
So Boston Dynamics has been testing out the Atlas robot for years at doing.

17:14.200 --> 17:18.480
You've seen all these videos where it's juggling and dancing and doing flips and all kinds

17:18.480 --> 17:19.480
of crazy stuff.

17:19.480 --> 17:21.400
Well, that was all a hydraulic robot.

17:21.400 --> 17:23.960
This new one is an all-electric robot.

17:23.960 --> 17:27.800
And by the way, that original Atlas was kind of more of a tech demonstrator, more of an

17:27.800 --> 17:29.200
R&D platform.

17:29.200 --> 17:33.360
This one is actually designed to be sold and put into work in factories and stuff.

17:33.360 --> 17:35.400
They just revealed the new Electric Atlas.

17:35.400 --> 17:38.560
This one video is the only thing that we've seen, but it's pretty mind blowing.

17:38.560 --> 17:42.000
So there's not a whole lot of info about it right now, but we do know that they're

17:42.000 --> 17:44.360
set to be used in a Hyundai plant.

17:44.360 --> 17:46.200
Hyundai actually owns Boston Dynamics.

17:46.200 --> 17:48.560
So it's going to get some real world views pretty soon.

17:48.560 --> 17:52.240
Sanctuary AI is a company we haven't heard a whole lot from, but their Phoenix robot

17:52.240 --> 17:56.080
has possibly the most dextrous hands with 20 degrees of freedom.

17:56.080 --> 17:59.960
It's based on an AI robotics platform called Carbon that they had created separately a few

17:59.960 --> 18:00.960
years back.

18:00.960 --> 18:04.520
And they'll be pilot testing it with an auto parts manufacturer called Magna, who is an

18:04.520 --> 18:06.320
investor in the company.

18:06.320 --> 18:09.640
Another super impressive robot is from a company called Figure AI.

18:09.640 --> 18:11.560
It's the Figure 01 robot.

18:11.560 --> 18:16.560
And this is sort of open AI's entrance into robotics that's based on GPT-4.

18:16.560 --> 18:20.560
And when it talks to you, it talks in an eerily human way.

18:20.560 --> 18:21.560
Great.

18:21.560 --> 18:22.560
Can I have something to eat?

18:22.560 --> 18:23.560
Sure thing.

18:23.560 --> 18:24.560
Great.

18:24.560 --> 18:37.760
Can you explain why you did what you just did while you pick up this trash?

18:37.760 --> 18:41.680
On it.

18:41.680 --> 18:47.080
So I gave you the apple because it's the only edible item I could provide you with from

18:47.080 --> 18:48.080
the table.

18:48.080 --> 18:52.680
And in February of this year, they raised $675 million from investors, including open

18:52.680 --> 18:55.200
AI, Microsoft, and Jeff Bezos.

18:55.200 --> 18:58.320
And they expect to be piloting it at a BMW plant by the end of the year.

18:58.320 --> 19:02.680
A rather unique entrance into the humanoid robot sphere is One X Technologies and their

19:02.680 --> 19:04.320
robot called Eve.

19:04.320 --> 19:06.160
Unlike others, this one is not bipedal.

19:06.160 --> 19:09.880
It's actually on wheels, so it rolls around everywhere, although they are working on a

19:09.880 --> 19:12.160
bipedal version that will be coming out later.

19:12.160 --> 19:15.960
This can be controlled remotely or operate autonomously, and it's been working in some

19:15.960 --> 19:17.800
warehouses since 2019.

19:17.800 --> 19:20.800
And this is the first robot that's actually on the market and available to buy.

19:20.800 --> 19:23.400
I think they sell it for around $16,000.

19:23.400 --> 19:25.920
And of course, there's Tesla's Optimus Gen 2.

19:25.920 --> 19:29.240
While this hasn't actually been put to use in any factories or anything, it's getting

19:29.240 --> 19:32.920
close to field tests, and Tesla obviously has plenty of factories that it can put it

19:32.920 --> 19:33.920
in.

19:33.920 --> 19:38.200
I'm excited that they would go on sale in 2025, but let's not hold our breath on that.

19:38.200 --> 19:41.080
While it's definitely more trendy to dunk on Tesla these days, I've got to say I'm

19:41.080 --> 19:43.760
actually really impressed with what they've been able to do with this robot in such a

19:43.760 --> 19:44.760
short amount of time.

19:44.760 --> 19:49.560
And last but not least is a company called Aptronic, and their robot called Apollo.

19:49.560 --> 19:53.200
This was developed at the University of Texas in Austin, and it's actually had some involvement

19:53.200 --> 19:54.200
with NASA.

19:54.200 --> 19:56.760
They plan on maybe using this in some space situations.

19:56.760 --> 20:00.880
The company's CEO claimed that it could be useful in, quote, construction, oil and gas,

20:00.880 --> 20:05.560
electronics production, retail, home delivery, elder care, and countless more areas.

20:05.560 --> 20:08.360
And Mercedes-Benz plans to put them in some factories starting this year.

20:08.360 --> 20:10.520
Okay, so what does all this mean exactly?

20:10.520 --> 20:13.080
Like, do we need to be worried about this or not?

20:13.080 --> 20:14.080
It kind of depends.

20:14.080 --> 20:17.960
I think depending on what kind of person you are, it's either an existential threat that's

20:17.960 --> 20:21.720
going to doom us all, or it's going to be the greatest thing that ever happened.

20:21.720 --> 20:26.480
The author Tony Siba recently chimed in about the humanoid robots thing on his website,

20:26.480 --> 20:29.760
RethinkX, and he's got a lot to say about it.

20:29.760 --> 20:33.360
So Tony Siba, if you don't know, he's somebody who talked a while back about autonomous cars

20:33.360 --> 20:35.440
and the EV revolution and stuff.

20:35.440 --> 20:41.440
He points out, oftentimes in his talks, how automobiles completely displace horses between

20:41.440 --> 20:43.240
1907 and 1922.

20:43.240 --> 20:47.240
But his point in this blog is that we are the horses.

20:47.240 --> 20:51.080
He talks about the humanoid robot revolution as being a disruption that's caused by the

20:51.080 --> 20:52.760
convergence of a few different factors.

20:52.760 --> 20:57.240
One being sensors, computer hardware and software, actuators, and battery technology.

20:57.240 --> 21:02.200
He predicts the humanoid robots will have a cost capability of $10 an hour by 2035 and

21:02.200 --> 21:06.760
under $0.10 an hour before 2045 and will eventually approach zero.

21:06.760 --> 21:10.920
And you may see some of those videos and you think that they're clumsy and they're awkward

21:10.920 --> 21:13.840
and everything, and they are, but they're quickly getting better.

21:13.840 --> 21:18.360
I mean, keeping in mind, as always, that they are the most expensive and least capable they

21:18.360 --> 21:19.760
will ever be right now.

21:19.760 --> 21:23.160
But even if they are like half the speed of humans, the fact that they never get tired,

21:23.160 --> 21:26.760
they never need breaks, that gives them an automatic edge.

21:26.760 --> 21:30.920
In fact, on assembly line situations, they might never run out of power because they

21:30.920 --> 21:33.720
could just probably plug in wherever it is that they're standing.

21:33.720 --> 21:36.000
Also robots can collectively learn.

21:36.000 --> 21:40.200
So if one robot gets taught a certain thing and knew a different way to sort things or

21:40.200 --> 21:44.360
whatever on an assembly line, immediately all the other robots will know how to do it.

21:44.360 --> 21:47.800
So something he's suggesting in his blog post is that this is basically going to be a turn

21:47.800 --> 21:51.840
into a production arms race amongst countries to build this robot labor force.

21:51.840 --> 21:56.520
So this is going to be sort of a force multiplier in terms of how fast this stuff gets adopted.

21:56.520 --> 22:00.320
Now in this blog post, he paints it mostly in glowing terms about how this disruption

22:00.320 --> 22:03.880
will also fuel disruptions in energy, transportation, and food.

22:03.880 --> 22:07.920
And with birth rates declining, robots can kind of take over for a shrinking labor market

22:07.920 --> 22:08.920
in the long run.

22:08.920 --> 22:11.560
And he suggests that it might be more of a soft landing.

22:11.560 --> 22:15.200
It's not going to be a really immediate thing that for the next couple of decades robots

22:15.200 --> 22:19.160
will probably just supplement humans, kind of doing the jobs that we don't want to do,

22:19.160 --> 22:23.640
filling in the gaps in the labor force and whatnot before, yeah, eventually just replacing

22:23.640 --> 22:25.840
us in the labor market altogether.

22:26.080 --> 22:30.560
We kind of have a couple of decades to figure out how we're going to do this, but it is

22:30.560 --> 22:34.560
going to take a completely new rethinking of economics as we know it.

22:34.560 --> 22:38.560
So we've heard about universal basic income, talked about a million times.

22:38.560 --> 22:44.520
There is a new twist on that that Sam Altman from OpenAI kind of put out there recently.

22:44.520 --> 22:46.960
He talks about universal basic compute.

22:46.960 --> 22:52.760
He suggested in the future as AI kind of takes over all of our cognitive load for all the

22:52.760 --> 22:58.160
work that we do that instead of sharing money in terms of universal basic income, we would

22:58.160 --> 23:03.120
share in the computational processing that goes on.

23:03.120 --> 23:08.680
So universal basic compute, kind of insinuating that computing will become currency.

23:08.680 --> 23:12.920
And I feel like whether or not you think this is a good or a bad idea depends on whether

23:12.920 --> 23:19.280
you trust those at the top to, you know, find solutions that work for people and not companies.

23:19.320 --> 23:23.920
I fully understand any skepticism of that, but I say it all the time.

23:23.920 --> 23:27.160
I think things are probably going to get worse before they get better because we've got to figure

23:27.160 --> 23:30.560
something out and figuring things out takes a little bit of time.

23:30.560 --> 23:35.840
And all I know is that what we're operating on right now is not going to be sufficient

23:35.840 --> 23:40.400
in a couple of decades, talking like yourselves about that.

23:40.400 --> 23:44.320
But anyway, let's just put the existential dread part of the video behind us and say we

23:44.320 --> 23:46.120
do figure it out at some point.

23:46.120 --> 23:48.680
Let's get back to the original question.

23:48.680 --> 23:50.560
Why learn anything anymore?

23:50.560 --> 23:53.720
I say because people will still be people.

23:53.720 --> 23:58.520
Yes, many people will be complacent and be happy with never having to know anything.

23:58.520 --> 24:00.200
That's true now.

24:00.200 --> 24:01.560
That's always been true.

24:01.560 --> 24:05.480
But many people, many of you included, I'm sure if you watch this channel, many people

24:05.480 --> 24:09.840
are curious and they hunger for knowledge and they'll seek out understanding of things

24:09.840 --> 24:14.080
even if there is a simpler way out there to get that information, you know.

24:14.080 --> 24:17.520
Many people are skeptical and need to see things for themselves.

24:17.520 --> 24:18.960
This has also always been true.

24:18.960 --> 24:21.760
So regardless of what happens to society, there's always going to be some people out

24:21.760 --> 24:27.560
there who just want to learn things, who experience the joy of disparate knowledge, who revel in

24:27.560 --> 24:29.080
the ephemera of it all.

24:29.080 --> 24:33.920
And honestly, that might be like the guiding principle of this channel when it all comes

24:33.920 --> 24:34.920
down to it.

24:34.920 --> 24:39.600
You know, I just think that life is more interesting when you know things, you know, that random

24:39.600 --> 24:43.840
information that kind of just gets into your brain over time, they start to connect with

24:43.840 --> 24:44.840
each other.

24:45.200 --> 24:48.520
It just makes life more fun, it makes life more interesting to have all those little

24:48.520 --> 24:49.520
connections in there.

24:49.520 --> 24:54.280
Like, it kind of makes me think of emergence theory, you know, that knowledge isn't just

24:54.280 --> 24:57.960
about memorizing a bunch of stuff, it's about making connections between things that you've

24:57.960 --> 25:00.760
never made a connection with before, you know.

25:00.760 --> 25:03.840
The human brain, after all, it's just a collection of cells.

25:03.840 --> 25:07.120
And it's how these cells connect with each other that makes the magic happen.

25:07.120 --> 25:08.600
That's why it's called a connectome.

25:08.600 --> 25:12.240
You know, an ant by itself is nothing, but millions of ants working together can create

25:12.240 --> 25:15.080
a sophisticated society and build megastructures.

25:15.080 --> 25:17.400
You know, and pieces of information in your head work the same way.

25:17.400 --> 25:19.720
It's just all random information.

25:19.720 --> 25:24.600
It's only when those pieces of information connect that you get ideas and inspiration.

25:24.600 --> 25:26.680
And ideas and inspiration are exciting, you know.

25:26.680 --> 25:27.680
They make life interesting.

25:27.680 --> 25:32.200
They give you aha moments where you have to rethink everything you thought you knew.

25:32.200 --> 25:33.760
They can give you purpose.

25:33.760 --> 25:38.040
And that's the greatest precursor to happiness and longevity, having a purpose in your life.

25:38.040 --> 25:42.120
So maybe in the future, the education system will pivot to reflect that, you know.

25:42.120 --> 25:45.920
Making kids how to think more than what to think, how to be critical of the information

25:45.920 --> 25:49.520
and misinformation that they receive, and encouraging nerding out on things.

25:49.520 --> 25:53.840
It might be based more on connecting the dots and finding inspiration in things.

25:53.840 --> 25:54.840
There's a quote by E.O.

25:54.840 --> 25:58.520
Wilson that I think sums this all up pretty well when he said, quote, we are drowning

25:58.520 --> 26:00.920
in information while starving for wisdom.

26:00.920 --> 26:04.880
The world henceforth will be run by synthesizers, people who can put together the right information

26:04.880 --> 26:09.360
at the right time, think critically about it, and make important choices wisely.

26:09.360 --> 26:12.200
So maybe eventually education will shift to focus on that.

26:12.200 --> 26:13.800
So yeah, why bother learning things?

26:13.800 --> 26:18.320
I would say because you're planting seeds, they'll later sprout into passions and interests

26:18.320 --> 26:20.160
that you never knew you had.

26:20.160 --> 26:21.800
And that's really important stuff.

26:21.800 --> 26:25.120
One passion that I have is saving time, and that's why I only spend two minutes a day

26:25.120 --> 26:27.920
preparing my lunch and dinner from today's sponsor, Factor.

26:27.920 --> 26:31.680
Yeah, in the future they may have replicators to get your food faster, but today Factor

26:31.680 --> 26:33.080
is about the closest thing to it.

26:33.080 --> 26:36.080
Factor's a meal delivery service where you can tell them how many meals you want each

26:36.080 --> 26:40.080
week, what kind of meal plan you want to be on, like calorie smart, vegetarian, Keto,

26:40.080 --> 26:43.560
you name it, and they send you a box with pre-made restaurant quality meals that heat

26:43.560 --> 26:45.720
up in the microwave in only two minutes.

26:45.720 --> 26:49.120
It's like ordering from a meal delivery app except it takes less time, costs way less

26:49.120 --> 26:52.760
money, and the best part, I think anyway, they're actually healthy.

26:52.760 --> 26:56.280
Factor's chefs work side by side with dieticians to craft meals that are not just delicious

26:56.280 --> 26:59.720
but low calorie, and hit your target macros and all that stuff.

26:59.720 --> 27:03.320
They also use fresh ingredients from family farms and they're not frozen.

27:03.320 --> 27:06.880
Like trust me, I hate frozen dinners, they're always weird, textures and freezer burn and

27:06.880 --> 27:07.880
whatnot.

27:07.880 --> 27:08.880
Factor's got none of that.

27:08.880 --> 27:12.160
They've also got delicious breakfast and gourmet options if you're just too good to

27:12.160 --> 27:13.760
eat like the rest of us please.

27:13.760 --> 27:18.200
And don't get me started on the smoothies, they're just the bomb dot com dot org dot

27:18.200 --> 27:19.200
net.

27:19.200 --> 27:23.400
They fill me up, they get me through my day, I enjoy eating them, and it keeps my waistline

27:23.400 --> 27:24.400
in check.

27:24.400 --> 27:26.680
So yeah, that's not much more than I could ask for.

27:26.680 --> 27:30.640
I've probably heard me mention Factor before, and if you haven't tried it, I don't know,

27:30.640 --> 27:33.360
I'll give you the skeptical type, whatever, I respect that.

27:33.360 --> 27:36.400
But if you're curious, there's a special deal that might get you to pull the trigger.

27:52.360 --> 27:53.880
I really think you'll like it.

27:53.880 --> 27:57.760

Anyway, I want to hear what you guys think about the whole humanoid robot thing and why

28:16.420 --> 28:18.040
we should learn things and whatnot.

28:18.040 --> 28:19.540
What do you enjoy learning?
