1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,180
There was a period of time on 9-11 when nobody knew what was going on.

2
00:00:05,180 --> 00:00:07,660
A plane had hit the World Trade Center.

3
00:00:07,660 --> 00:00:08,940
Everybody on the news was talking about it.

4
00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:12,260
There were rumors that other planes had been hijacked, that there was some kind of major

5
00:00:12,260 --> 00:00:14,900
attack, but nobody knew for sure.

6
00:00:14,900 --> 00:00:19,060
There were all kinds of crazy rumors swirling around, but in that moment, it was just as

7
00:00:19,060 --> 00:00:23,660
likely that this was just a horrible accident, just a thing that went wrong, and nothing

8
00:00:23,660 --> 00:00:28,020
more than that.

9
00:00:28,020 --> 00:00:30,140
And then the second tower was hit.

10
00:00:30,140 --> 00:00:35,140
That was the moment that all the confusion went away, and we all collectively realized

11
00:00:35,140 --> 00:00:40,600
at the exact same time, oh, we're living in a different world now.

12
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:43,780
I think we're kind of having that moment right now with AI.

13
00:00:43,780 --> 00:00:47,020
For the last 10 years or so, we have been hearing about how this technology is going

14
00:00:47,020 --> 00:00:48,020
to change the world.

15
00:00:48,020 --> 00:00:50,860
It's going to take all of our jobs, leave society unrecognizable.

16
00:00:50,860 --> 00:00:55,540
There's just been this background anxiety about it, what AI could do, but for the most

17
00:00:55,540 --> 00:01:00,140
part, it was just like an abstract thing that we couldn't really see or imagine.

18
00:01:00,140 --> 00:01:03,940
But some recent advancements have made this abstract thing a lot more clear.

19
00:01:03,940 --> 00:01:11,060
AIs that can generate articles, music, images, video, and code, meaning they could create

20
00:01:11,060 --> 00:01:12,060
more AIs.

21
00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:15,940
There are even people using AIs to build and run businesses, all by themselves, making

22
00:01:15,940 --> 00:01:17,420
thousands of dollars a day.

23
00:01:17,420 --> 00:01:20,780
At the very least, these are the new tools that in five years or so, you're going to

24
00:01:20,780 --> 00:01:22,860
be at a disadvantage if you don't know how to use them.

25
00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:26,100
And at the very most, we're seeing just the tip of the iceberg of a technology that will

26
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:30,700
radically reshape our society in ways that we can't possibly comprehend.

27
00:01:30,700 --> 00:01:34,780
What we're seeing right now is AI's second tower moment.

28
00:01:34,780 --> 00:01:38,860
Whichever way this goes, we're in a different world now.

29
00:01:38,860 --> 00:01:45,180
All right, so this is a video about what's going on with AI right now.

30
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:52,500
And the thing is, what's going on with AI right now is it's changing extremely fast.

31
00:01:52,620 --> 00:01:56,380
There are entire channels dedicated to following this stuff that post multiple times a week

32
00:01:56,380 --> 00:02:00,860
and they're struggling to keep up, so the idea that this video is going to be timely

33
00:02:00,860 --> 00:02:01,860
is just laughable.

34
00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:04,740
Yeah, things have happened since you started watching this video that already makes this

35
00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:05,740
video obsolete.

36
00:02:05,740 --> 00:02:08,140
And that's kind of the whole point.

37
00:02:08,140 --> 00:02:12,740
For years we've been hearing about the idea of the singularity, the moment that AI outpaces

38
00:02:12,740 --> 00:02:15,860
us and the unimaginable becomes real.

39
00:02:15,860 --> 00:02:17,820
I covered it a few times early on in this channel.

40
00:02:17,820 --> 00:02:21,380
And I've been making the argument actually for the most part that when you step back

41
00:02:21,380 --> 00:02:25,620
and you scale things back and look at the big picture, we're in the singularity.

42
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:26,940
We've been in it for a couple hundred years.

43
00:02:26,940 --> 00:02:31,340
Yeah, I kind of got away from the idea that the singularity was this one single event,

44
00:02:31,340 --> 00:02:34,020
just one moment when everything changed all at once.

45
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:38,020
I started seeing it as an era of history that began maybe with the birth of the Industrial

46
00:02:38,020 --> 00:02:41,900
Revolution when we learned how to harness energy or maybe even the invention of the

47
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:45,540
printing press and we learned how to pass information on through space and time.

48
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:47,180
Everything just kind of hockey sticks after that.

49
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:52,740
But what's been happening lately is starting to feel like the classic version of the singularity.

50
00:02:52,740 --> 00:02:53,740
You know?

51
00:02:53,740 --> 00:02:56,980
Like we're just rolling downhill and about to cross the event horizon of this thing where

52
00:02:56,980 --> 00:02:58,380
there's no going back.

53
00:02:58,380 --> 00:03:00,060
Hyperbole much, Joe?

54
00:03:02,620 --> 00:03:03,620
I don't know.

55
00:03:03,620 --> 00:03:05,340
I mean, not if you listen to the hype around it.

56
00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:08,940
Judging on the hype that you've been hearing about AI, this could go in two very different

57
00:03:08,940 --> 00:03:09,940
ways.

58
00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:14,300
On one hand, AI could solve all of our problems, cure cancer, create new methods of propulsion

59
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:15,660
and clean energy.

60
00:03:15,660 --> 00:03:19,380
All the issues we're currently dealing with that we fear will destroy us someday, AI could

61
00:03:19,380 --> 00:03:23,900
be an unimaginably powerful tool to solve those problems.

62
00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:25,380
This is one possible outcome.

63
00:03:25,380 --> 00:03:30,740
But then there's the other outcome, where in an inconceivably short time AI becomes smarter

64
00:03:30,740 --> 00:03:35,060
than us, it becomes an intelligence we can't possibly fathom, leading to the extinction

65
00:03:35,060 --> 00:03:36,060
of the human race.

66
00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:40,860
And to me anyway, no discussion of AI is possible without talking about both the good and the

67
00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:41,860
bad.

68
00:03:41,860 --> 00:03:44,580
So that's what I'm going to try to do here.

69
00:03:44,580 --> 00:03:45,580
And it's difficult.

70
00:03:45,580 --> 00:03:49,060
I'm trying really hard, guys.

71
00:03:49,060 --> 00:03:53,820
Honestly, I have had to restart this video like four or five different times, because

72
00:03:53,820 --> 00:03:58,340
every time I thought that I was done, I would find some article or see some video that kind

73
00:03:58,340 --> 00:04:02,940
of threw my entire point out the window and I would have to start all over again.

74
00:04:02,940 --> 00:04:06,580
There's just so many takes on this subject and it's not that any of them are wrong, actually

75
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:08,700
the problem is that a lot of them are right.

76
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:09,700
They're probably all right.

77
00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:11,420
In fact, one of them got into eugenics.

78
00:04:11,420 --> 00:04:12,420
I didn't see that coming.

79
00:04:12,420 --> 00:04:15,300
I mean, nobody even knows exactly how these things work.

80
00:04:15,300 --> 00:04:19,340
Even the experts that have been working on this for decades, so like how am I supposed

81
00:04:19,340 --> 00:04:21,300
to add anything to this conversation?

82
00:04:21,300 --> 00:04:23,940
Like what can I possibly say that hasn't already been said?

83
00:04:23,940 --> 00:04:26,740
And if I'm being honest, I haven't even really been keeping up with this.

84
00:04:26,740 --> 00:04:30,300
There's like a 50,000 AI apps out there and I haven't been able to mess with any of them

85
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:32,420
because I'm always just trying to get the next video out.

86
00:04:32,420 --> 00:04:35,540
So not only am I trying to make an informative video out of this thing, I've got to get

87
00:04:35,540 --> 00:04:38,860
caught up on a technology that I've been following way behind on like I couldn't feel

88
00:04:38,860 --> 00:04:40,860
more older and out of touch.

89
00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:43,940
And the biggest irony of all is that I'm sitting here struggling really hard to write a script

90
00:04:43,940 --> 00:04:48,100
about a technology whose core value is that it can write the script for me.

91
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:50,740
Maybe I should just pick up where my last AI video left off.

92
00:04:50,740 --> 00:04:53,420
When was the last time I made a video about AI?

93
00:04:53,420 --> 00:04:57,260
My last video on AI was in 2016.

94
00:04:57,260 --> 00:04:58,260
Wow.

95
00:04:58,260 --> 00:05:02,780
Oh, there's a little baby YouTuber back then.

96
00:05:02,780 --> 00:05:05,900
Okay, so yeah, the last video was talking about the three different levels of AI.

97
00:05:05,900 --> 00:05:07,940
So why don't we just do a quick refresher on that?

98
00:05:07,940 --> 00:05:08,940
All right.

99
00:05:08,940 --> 00:05:09,940
Let's take a quick picture.

100
00:05:09,940 --> 00:05:11,860
When we talk about AI, there's three different levels.

101
00:05:11,860 --> 00:05:15,540
There's artificial narrow intelligence, artificial general intelligence, and artificial super

102
00:05:15,540 --> 00:05:16,540
intelligence.

103
00:05:16,540 --> 00:05:19,380
Narrow AI is what we've been dealing with for a long time now.

104
00:05:19,380 --> 00:05:24,580
This has taken the form of chatbots to spell check, image processing that helps with photography,

105
00:05:24,580 --> 00:05:27,260
astronomy, medical diagnostics, and so on.

106
00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:28,940
Voice recognition is a kind of AI.

107
00:05:28,940 --> 00:05:30,460
Virtual assistance like Siri and Alexa.

108
00:05:30,460 --> 00:05:33,860
There's all kinds of AI in gaming, aviation, search engines.

109
00:05:33,860 --> 00:05:34,860
The list goes on.

110
00:05:34,860 --> 00:05:38,580
AI's help make our jobs easier and our lives more efficient in a million different ways.

111
00:05:38,580 --> 00:05:41,540
It's also manipulated our society in ways we're just now beginning to come to grips

112
00:05:41,540 --> 00:05:42,540
with.

113
00:05:42,540 --> 00:05:45,940
All the polarization, isolation, depression that we've been seeing by social media, these

114
00:05:45,940 --> 00:05:50,060
are products of algorithms that are themselves a kind of AI.

115
00:05:50,060 --> 00:05:53,500
I know some of the biggest algorithm experts at YouTube, and I can tell you they're just

116
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:57,020
trying to figure it out like the rest of us, only they have millions of channels worth

117
00:05:57,020 --> 00:05:59,540
of data to deal with versus one or a few channels.

118
00:05:59,540 --> 00:06:02,220
Yeah, the algorithm is basically like an alien life form.

119
00:06:02,220 --> 00:06:03,980
Nobody really knows how it works.

120
00:06:03,980 --> 00:06:09,140
It's a black box that nobody can see inside of or understand, much less control.

121
00:06:09,140 --> 00:06:10,460
This is the point that will come up later.

122
00:06:10,460 --> 00:06:14,180
Yeah, all of these AI's are amazing and powerful, but they're all examples of, again, narrow

123
00:06:14,180 --> 00:06:15,180
AI.

124
00:06:15,180 --> 00:06:18,380
They're built and trained to do one specific thing, and they do that one specific thing

125
00:06:18,380 --> 00:06:21,500
better than any person could, but that's all they can do.

126
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:25,100
And we're already seeing this bifurcation of scenarios, you know, simultaneously incredible

127
00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:28,740
and amazing, but also tearing apart the fabric of society.

128
00:06:28,740 --> 00:06:32,500
Artificial general intelligence is AI that can do all the things that narrow AI can do,

129
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:33,500
but for everything.

130
00:06:33,780 --> 00:06:35,900
It's a generalist, much more like a human being.

131
00:06:35,900 --> 00:06:37,260
I want to make sure that I'm clear here.

132
00:06:37,260 --> 00:06:40,180
I'm not talking about consciousness or sentience at this point.

133
00:06:40,180 --> 00:06:41,420
This isn't an artificial life form.

134
00:06:41,420 --> 00:06:44,180
We're not talking about giving it personhood or rights or anything.

135
00:06:44,180 --> 00:06:47,740
In fact, the consciousness thing, it doesn't even play into this conversation right now.

136
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:51,680
I think it's better to just kind of set that aside.

137
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:53,780
That muddy's waters that are already pretty muddy.

138
00:06:53,780 --> 00:06:57,540
A general AI is just AI that can have the same capacities as a human brain.

139
00:06:57,540 --> 00:07:00,700
It can analyze images, but it can also make music.

140
00:07:00,700 --> 00:07:02,780
It can problem solve and strategize.

141
00:07:02,780 --> 00:07:04,460
It can deceive and manipulate.

142
00:07:04,460 --> 00:07:08,500
Here's the thing about artificial general intelligence, though, when it does happen,

143
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:09,500
you'll probably miss it.

144
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:14,220
Because if an AI has the same capacity that we have, well, one of the capacities that

145
00:07:14,220 --> 00:07:16,660
we have is that we can make an AI smarter.

146
00:07:16,660 --> 00:07:23,220
So if an AI that's as smart as we are can create a smarter AI, that by definition is

147
00:07:23,220 --> 00:07:25,060
artificial superintelligence.

148
00:07:25,060 --> 00:07:28,660
This is what futurists have been saying for a long time now, that pretty much the instant

149
00:07:28,660 --> 00:07:32,620
we reach artificial general intelligence, we will reach artificial superintelligence.

150
00:07:32,620 --> 00:07:35,140
AI that's smarter than a human.

151
00:07:35,140 --> 00:07:37,020
Smarter than all humans combined for that matter.

152
00:07:37,020 --> 00:07:40,460
And this is where things really split into a couple of different directions.

153
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:45,380
On one hand, we could see a utopia where every disease has a cure, aging can be reversed,

154
00:07:45,380 --> 00:07:50,620
resources perfectly allocated for all, the climate and equilibrium, economic recessions,

155
00:07:50,620 --> 00:07:54,780
forever eradicated, all our wants and needs fulfilled, so we can spend our limitless lives

156
00:07:54,780 --> 00:07:57,020
and pursue knowledge and happiness.

157
00:07:57,020 --> 00:08:00,460
We're in an effort to get rid of all conflict that suppresses us all into an authoritarian

158
00:08:00,460 --> 00:08:04,460
surveillance state devoid of free will, with all of our wants and needs doled out according

159
00:08:04,460 --> 00:08:09,340
to its all-powerful insistence on order, creating a techno-slave state.

160
00:08:09,340 --> 00:08:12,860
Or it could decide that the common denominator in all the world's problems is humanity itself

161
00:08:12,860 --> 00:08:16,100
and wipes us out the face of the earth, replacing us with robots and machines that live on for

162
00:08:16,100 --> 00:08:19,580
a billion years, eventually spreading to distant stars and eradicating all potential life in

163
00:08:19,580 --> 00:08:26,860
the universe from existence.

164
00:08:27,860 --> 00:08:33,380
There is, of course, another option, which is that all of this is just hype.

165
00:08:33,380 --> 00:08:37,340
Just way overblown hype by companies who invested billions of dollars into this and

166
00:08:37,340 --> 00:08:39,060
now need to sell the product they made.

167
00:08:39,060 --> 00:08:42,380
In fact, there's an argument to be made that this is just another gold rush.

168
00:08:42,380 --> 00:08:44,220
AI is the new crypto.

169
00:08:44,220 --> 00:08:48,060
And there definitely is a gold rush of sorts going on with all these new AI tools suddenly

170
00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:52,380
being integrated in everything with a keyboard, some of which are awesome, yeah, but some

171
00:08:52,380 --> 00:08:54,820
of which just don't make any bloody sense.

172
00:08:54,820 --> 00:08:56,820
But really, this isn't anything new.

173
00:08:56,820 --> 00:09:00,380
Technology has been using AI as a catch-all buzzword for the last decade.

174
00:09:00,380 --> 00:09:03,300
It's just like this thing that they say to convince you to buy their product and say

175
00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:06,900
that their product is better because it has AI in it, you know, everything from cars to

176
00:09:06,900 --> 00:09:10,420
HVAC units to washing machines, coffee makers.

177
00:09:10,420 --> 00:09:16,020
Tech investors need to beware, 40% of companies in Europe are now claimed to be AI startups

178
00:09:16,020 --> 00:09:20,140
have actually, if you can believe this, little or no connection with artificial intelligence

179
00:09:20,140 --> 00:09:21,140
at all.

180
00:09:21,140 --> 00:09:25,540
Now, in these cases, the AI is usually just like an algorithm that allows a device to

181
00:09:25,580 --> 00:09:27,860
self-adjust or optimize according to the situation.

182
00:09:27,860 --> 00:09:32,380
And they've got their merits, you know, as the kind of narrow AI I was just talking about.

183
00:09:32,380 --> 00:09:33,940
But it is also just marketing.

184
00:09:33,940 --> 00:09:36,420
So, yeah, on one hand, AI is nothing new.

185
00:09:36,420 --> 00:09:39,220
It's been used to sell us on products for a long time.

186
00:09:39,220 --> 00:09:42,220
What we're dealing with right now, though, is something different.

187
00:09:42,220 --> 00:09:43,660
This is generative AI.

188
00:09:43,660 --> 00:09:46,460
Not to be confused with general AI that I was talking about a second ago.

189
00:09:46,460 --> 00:09:49,220
Generative AI, though, it's exactly what it sounds like.

190
00:09:49,220 --> 00:09:51,820
It's AI that generates something that didn't exist before.

191
00:09:51,860 --> 00:09:55,780
And this does feel like it just kind of popped up out of nowhere in the last couple of years.

192
00:09:55,780 --> 00:09:59,860
But again, it's really just a culmination of a lot of things we've been getting used

193
00:09:59,860 --> 00:10:01,020
to for a while now.

194
00:10:01,020 --> 00:10:04,380
We kind of started seeing the first sparks of this back in 2015 when videos like this

195
00:10:04,380 --> 00:10:07,940
from Google's Deep Dream Project started kind of making their way around the Internet.

196
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:11,700
The AI would basically start off with a picture and then it would find patterns in that picture

197
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:15,380
and the alignment of pixels and whatnot that it would recognize as other images, kind of

198
00:10:15,380 --> 00:10:17,820
like us seeing faces or shapes in the clouds.

199
00:10:17,820 --> 00:10:21,020
It would then pull from a set of images and insert them into the image leading to these

200
00:10:21,020 --> 00:10:25,540
mind-bidding visuals of animals and faces reminiscent of a heroic dose of mushrooms.

201
00:10:25,540 --> 00:10:27,460
Or so I've heard.

202
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:31,820
Following that, the research continued into training AI models to recognize objects and

203
00:10:31,820 --> 00:10:32,820
images.

204
00:10:32,820 --> 00:10:35,300
That's pretty much what all those captures were all about, finding the stoplights and

205
00:10:35,300 --> 00:10:36,300
the cars in the images.

206
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:39,300
You've been training AI models this whole time and didn't even know it.

207
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:42,780
You also started to see tools in Photoshop like content-aware fill and scale that will

208
00:10:42,780 --> 00:10:46,860
intelligently replace objects and add extra photo to the photo based on the space around

209
00:10:46,860 --> 00:10:47,860
it.

210
00:10:47,860 --> 00:10:49,300
That got fully integrated into Photoshop in 2019.

211
00:10:49,340 --> 00:10:51,660
I actually use this all the time on my thumbnails.

212
00:10:51,660 --> 00:10:55,780
And then there's the AI video and image filters that started on Snapchat and then on TikTok.

213
00:10:55,780 --> 00:10:59,860
Then there was a trend of AI-generated avatars and social media through apps like Lenza.

214
00:10:59,860 --> 00:11:02,980
I'm leaving a lot out, but the point is that all of these little AI tools and toys have

215
00:11:02,980 --> 00:11:05,740
been around for years and becoming more and more popular.

216
00:11:05,740 --> 00:11:08,700
Now at the same time that all this was happening, there were AI's that were learning natural

217
00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:09,820
language patterns.

218
00:11:09,820 --> 00:11:14,380
The first autocorrect features and word processors went back as far as 2003, but it became especially

219
00:11:14,380 --> 00:11:16,300
useful with the advent of smartphones.

220
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:19,940
A lot of text and phones and search engines soon followed, voice recognition paired with

221
00:11:19,940 --> 00:11:23,500
natural language models led to Siri in 2011, Alexa in 2014.

222
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:28,380
And then in 2021, OpenAI announced Dahle, which put the image and text features together

223
00:11:28,380 --> 00:11:31,900
and had the ability to create entirely new images based off of text prompts.

224
00:11:31,900 --> 00:11:35,940
All that labeling of objects and text recognition at all kind of came together so that if you

225
00:11:35,940 --> 00:11:40,620
entered the word camel, it knows what a camel is and it can search its massive image archive

226
00:11:40,620 --> 00:11:42,620
and it creates something that resembles a camel.

227
00:11:42,620 --> 00:11:44,860
The first Dahle was kind of under the radar though.

228
00:11:44,860 --> 00:11:46,380
It was kind of just made for research purposes.

229
00:11:46,380 --> 00:11:49,740
It was Dahle 2 that came out last year in 2022.

230
00:11:49,740 --> 00:11:52,540
That's what gave public access to this technology for the first time.

231
00:11:52,540 --> 00:11:56,100
Mid Journey came out about the same time and people kind of lost their minds.

232
00:11:56,100 --> 00:12:00,580
For the first time, literally anybody could just enter some words into a prompt and get

233
00:12:00,580 --> 00:12:02,380
a pretty good quality image out of it.

234
00:12:02,380 --> 00:12:05,060
And yet anybody who's been following this even a little bit can attest to how quickly

235
00:12:05,060 --> 00:12:06,900
this AI art has evolved.

236
00:12:06,900 --> 00:12:11,300
And then by the time we got used to all that, here comes ChatGPT.

237
00:12:11,300 --> 00:12:12,300
ChatGPT.

238
00:12:12,300 --> 00:12:13,300
ChatGPT.

239
00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:14,300
ChatGPT.

240
00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:15,300
ChatGPT.

241
00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:16,300
ChatGPT.

242
00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:17,300
ChatGPT.

243
00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:18,300
ChatGPT.

244
00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:19,300
ChatGPT.

245
00:12:19,300 --> 00:12:20,300
ChatGPT.

246
00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:23,780
Okay, so ChatGPT, in case you don't already know, it works off what's called a large

247
00:12:23,780 --> 00:12:25,580
language model or LLM.

248
00:12:25,580 --> 00:12:27,100
LLMs are neural networks.

249
00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:31,660
A neural network is a computer system that basically works like a brain.

250
00:12:31,660 --> 00:12:35,300
Just as a brain has billions of connections between neurons, LLMs have billions of connections

251
00:12:35,300 --> 00:12:37,900
between mathematical functions that act like neurons.

252
00:12:37,900 --> 00:12:40,340
I don't want to go too deep into how all this works, but I'll just quote a tweet from

253
00:12:40,340 --> 00:12:43,060
Peter Yang, a creator of Economy SO, who said this quote.

254
00:12:43,060 --> 00:12:46,300
Imagine that you have a library with a huge collection of books.

255
00:12:46,300 --> 00:12:49,180
You want to learn everything you can from these books, such as how to write a good essay

256
00:12:49,180 --> 00:12:51,140
and how to speak a foreign language.

257
00:12:51,140 --> 00:12:52,140
How can you do that?

258
00:12:52,140 --> 00:12:55,940
An LLM is a program that can generate text based off the books in your library.

259
00:12:55,940 --> 00:12:59,740
So it does kind of work just like predictive text on your phone.

260
00:12:59,740 --> 00:13:03,540
Where a phone has a library of a past text, it can kind of figure out what the most likely

261
00:13:03,540 --> 00:13:04,540
next word is going to be.

262
00:13:04,540 --> 00:13:07,420
So I'll say if you start to type your street address, it's learn that from watching your

263
00:13:07,420 --> 00:13:09,180
text and it autocompletes it.

264
00:13:09,180 --> 00:13:13,020
Only an LLM has millions upon millions of books and articles to draw from, and then

265
00:13:13,020 --> 00:13:15,460
they kind of weigh what they read in terms of importance.

266
00:13:15,460 --> 00:13:19,340
To be clear, this is a massive oversimplification, but you get the idea.

267
00:13:19,340 --> 00:13:22,980
The process of feeding an LLM gobs of text is called pre-training.

268
00:13:22,980 --> 00:13:26,700
When programmers want LLMs to get better at specific tasks, they can feed the LLM more

269
00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:27,700
focused text.

270
00:13:27,700 --> 00:13:28,700
This is called fine-tuning.

271
00:13:28,700 --> 00:13:31,820
But it's not really interesting giving the right answer.

272
00:13:31,820 --> 00:13:34,580
It's programmed to give the most likely answer.

273
00:13:34,580 --> 00:13:36,060
And a lot of times that answer's right.

274
00:13:36,060 --> 00:13:38,620
A lot of times it's not.

275
00:13:38,620 --> 00:13:42,780
For example, when I asked chatGbt to give me five facts about the YouTuber Joe Scott,

276
00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:43,780
this is what I got.

277
00:13:43,780 --> 00:13:47,340
Joe Scott is an American science communicator and YouTuber who creates videos about science,

278
00:13:47,340 --> 00:13:48,340
space, and technology.

279
00:13:48,340 --> 00:13:52,580
He's been creating content on YouTube since 2014 and has over 1.5 million subscribers.

280
00:13:52,580 --> 00:13:53,580
Accurate.

281
00:13:53,580 --> 00:13:56,500
Before becoming a full-time YouTuber, Joe worked as an engineer and consultant in the

282
00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:57,500
aerospace industry.

283
00:13:57,500 --> 00:14:01,300
He has a degree in aerospace engineering and a master's degree in systems engineering.

284
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:04,180
This is not true.

285
00:14:04,180 --> 00:14:07,660
Joe is known for his informative and well-researched videos which cover a wide range of scientific

286
00:14:07,660 --> 00:14:11,620
topics from black holes in space exploration to artificial intelligence and genetics.

287
00:14:11,620 --> 00:14:12,740
Well done, chatGbt.

288
00:14:12,740 --> 00:14:15,820
In addition to his main channel, he has a second channel called Answers with Joe, where

289
00:14:15,820 --> 00:14:17,900
he explores interesting questions that provide answers.

290
00:14:17,900 --> 00:14:18,900
That's...

291
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:22,780
The second channel's called TMI, so swing and a miss.

292
00:14:22,780 --> 00:14:25,180
Joe is an advocate for science education and outreach.

293
00:14:25,180 --> 00:14:26,460
Sure, that's true.

294
00:14:26,460 --> 00:14:30,740
He has spoken at events such as TEDx and collaborated with organizations such as NASA and the Planetary

295
00:14:30,740 --> 00:14:35,980
Society to help promote science, literacy, and interest in space exploration.

296
00:14:35,980 --> 00:14:36,980
I wish that were true.

297
00:14:36,980 --> 00:14:41,460
So yeah, out of five questions, two of them were completely bloody wrong and one of them

298
00:14:41,460 --> 00:14:42,940
was kind of half wrong.

299
00:14:42,940 --> 00:14:46,220
So also when I was messing around, I asked it to give me directions to the closest roller

300
00:14:46,220 --> 00:14:49,700
skating rink to where I live in East Dallas and it pointed me to a nice little skating

301
00:14:49,700 --> 00:14:54,220
rink at the corner of Gus Thomason and Ferguson, but when I looked it up on Google, it's actually

302
00:14:54,220 --> 00:14:57,020
way up in Plano about 10 miles away.

303
00:14:57,020 --> 00:15:02,220
So yeah, when people ask me if I use chatGPT to write my scripts for me, my answer is not

304
00:15:02,220 --> 00:15:03,700
just no, but hell no.

305
00:15:03,700 --> 00:15:07,860
In fact, the first time I ever really tried to do that, I was doing a video on smart cities.

306
00:15:07,860 --> 00:15:10,780
I tried to save a little time and asked it to write a few paragraphs about the planned

307
00:15:10,780 --> 00:15:14,020
city of Tulosa, Arizona, and it gave me this.

308
00:15:14,020 --> 00:15:17,500
Tulosa is a bustling metropolis located in the heart of the country with a population

309
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:18,500
of over 2 million people.

310
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:22,020
It's one of the largest cities in the nation and a major center of commerce, culture, and

311
00:15:22,020 --> 00:15:23,020
entertainment.

312
00:15:23,020 --> 00:15:26,700
The city is home to a diverse array of people with a rich mix of cultures, religions, and

313
00:15:26,700 --> 00:15:29,780
backgrounds, making it a vibrant and exciting place to live and visit.

314
00:15:29,780 --> 00:15:33,620
Tulosa is a cultural hotspot with numerous museums, galleries, and theaters showcasing

315
00:15:33,620 --> 00:15:37,460
the best in art, music, and performance, and it's home to many renowned musical and

316
00:15:37,460 --> 00:15:40,580
theater productions, as well as countless festivals and events that take place throughout

317
00:15:40,580 --> 00:15:41,580
the year.

318
00:15:41,580 --> 00:15:47,660
Yeah, um, this city does not exist.

319
00:15:47,660 --> 00:15:49,740
It's literally just computer renderings right now.

320
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:53,940
Now I will say I've used it to help create video titles for my videos and it's been

321
00:15:53,940 --> 00:15:55,140
pretty helpful with that.

322
00:15:55,140 --> 00:15:58,660
And also, while I was testing it out, I thought I would try seeing if it could help me brainstorm

323
00:15:58,660 --> 00:16:01,940
some ideas about a character that doesn't really exist.

324
00:16:01,940 --> 00:16:05,420
Say I'm writing a book and I made up this character about a farmer who's about to go

325
00:16:05,420 --> 00:16:06,420
bankrupt.

326
00:16:06,420 --> 00:16:09,620
The prompt I gave it was, I'm writing a story featuring a character that's a farmer trying

327
00:16:09,620 --> 00:16:11,420
to keep the family farm from going bankrupt.

328
00:16:11,420 --> 00:16:14,140
He's a tough man struggling to keep himself together for his family.

329
00:16:14,140 --> 00:16:16,100
What are some quirky characteristics I could give him?

330
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:18,540
And it gave me these options of superstitious.

331
00:16:18,540 --> 00:16:21,740
Your farmer could have a collection of unusual, lucky charms or rituals that he believes will

332
00:16:22,140 --> 00:16:28,260
bring good fortune to the farm, talks to animals, collects unusual items, expert whistler,

333
00:16:28,260 --> 00:16:34,660
green thumb for unconventional plants, fear of modern technology, expert storyteller,

334
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:36,820
proclivity for inventing gadgets.

335
00:16:36,820 --> 00:16:37,940
This is pretty good.

336
00:16:37,940 --> 00:16:40,100
Like, like that's seriously helpful.

337
00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:41,460
I could actually use that.

338
00:16:41,460 --> 00:16:45,980
Oh, and I also asked it to recite the to be or not to be speech in the style of Snoop Dogg.

339
00:16:45,980 --> 00:16:50,340
Um, I was kind of hoping to see a to be or not to bizzle, but I didn't get that.

340
00:16:50,340 --> 00:16:52,060
But I did get a matter of seconds.

341
00:16:52,060 --> 00:16:56,500
It created a whole rap verse that's honestly pretty impressive.

342
00:16:56,500 --> 00:16:57,500
Okay.

343
00:16:57,500 --> 00:16:59,380
Now I am not a power user of chat GPT.

344
00:16:59,380 --> 00:17:02,500
There's a million videos out there with great advice on how to create the best prompts to

345
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:03,500
get what you want.

346
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:06,140
I'll just direct you to some of those down in the description.

347
00:17:06,140 --> 00:17:10,700
By the way, my prediction is that the word prompts is the word of the year for 2023.

348
00:17:10,700 --> 00:17:11,700
Get used to that word.

349
00:17:11,700 --> 00:17:12,700
You're going to be hearing it a lot.

350
00:17:12,700 --> 00:17:17,060
So yeah, in my experience anyway, it works really well as a kind of springboard or brainstorming

351
00:17:17,060 --> 00:17:20,220
partner, less well as a source of accurate information.

352
00:17:20,220 --> 00:17:21,220
Yeah.

353
00:17:21,220 --> 00:17:24,900
Ironically, the computer program is better at creative thought than accurate information,

354
00:17:24,900 --> 00:17:30,500
which is fine, except, you know, Microsoft put it into being a search engine, a thing

355
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:32,980
people use to find accurate information.

356
00:17:32,980 --> 00:17:37,220
And this is a problem as bombastic as the prognostications around AI have been to me

357
00:17:37,220 --> 00:17:38,660
anyway.

358
00:17:38,660 --> 00:17:42,980
This is a much more immediate threat the way AI could accelerate the already massive problem

359
00:17:42,980 --> 00:17:43,980
misinformation online.

360
00:17:43,980 --> 00:17:47,700
You know, I keep hearing about people using this as a shortcut to creating content online,

361
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:48,700
which is fine.

362
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:52,180
Like I just said, there's some really helpful use cases for that, but you have to fact check

363
00:17:52,180 --> 00:17:53,180
it.

364
00:17:53,180 --> 00:17:55,940
And frankly, a lot of people aren't going to do that because for many people, whether

365
00:17:55,940 --> 00:17:57,420
or not it's accurate, it doesn't matter.

366
00:17:57,420 --> 00:17:59,580
It's just about giving people something to click on.

367
00:17:59,580 --> 00:18:02,700
Combine this with the rapid advancement of the image generating apps that are already

368
00:18:02,700 --> 00:18:07,180
damn near photorealistic and we are truly entering a post-truth age when literally any

369
00:18:07,180 --> 00:18:11,660
content can be faked, any image can be faked, any voice can be faked, I haven't even gotten

370
00:18:11,660 --> 00:18:12,660
to that one yet.

371
00:18:13,020 --> 00:18:15,780
And pretty soon, nobody's going to know what to believe anymore.

372
00:18:15,780 --> 00:18:18,740
So they'll just believe whatever they want to believe.

373
00:18:18,740 --> 00:18:22,940
Only increasing the fragmentation and distrust in our society, which is pretty god-awful

374
00:18:22,940 --> 00:18:23,940
already.

375
00:18:23,940 --> 00:18:27,740
Now the AI bros are quick to point out that this is the worst AI will ever be.

376
00:18:27,740 --> 00:18:29,900
That it'll only get better from here.

377
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:34,100
But on the other hand, it'll only get better from here.

378
00:18:34,100 --> 00:18:38,700
Now there are other LLMs being developed like Lambda from Meta and Bard from Google that

379
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:40,180
have not been released to the public.

380
00:18:40,180 --> 00:18:44,140
People especially being extremely cautious about releasing Bard because, you know, their

381
00:18:44,140 --> 00:18:46,740
entire reputation is based on their accuracy.

382
00:18:46,740 --> 00:18:50,940
Some will say that Microsoft was actually being really risky putting chat GBT into Bing

383
00:18:50,940 --> 00:18:54,900
so early, but let's be honest, nobody was using Bing so they really had nothing to lose.

384
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:58,740
But this does put pressure on Google to counter with their own search assistant and now we've

385
00:18:58,740 --> 00:19:00,300
got an AI arms race.

386
00:19:00,300 --> 00:19:03,620
But I guess, you know, maybe the upside is that there's only a handful of these LLMs

387
00:19:03,620 --> 00:19:06,980
right now because they take literally billions of dollars to train them.

388
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:10,300
Only that's not true anymore.

389
00:19:10,300 --> 00:19:14,260
Late last year researchers at Stanford announced a powerful LLM called Alpaca that could be

390
00:19:14,260 --> 00:19:17,740
pre-trained for as little as $600.

391
00:19:17,740 --> 00:19:21,540
They did it to create an LLM that academic institutions can test without, you know, needing

392
00:19:21,540 --> 00:19:23,300
billions of dollars of funding.

393
00:19:23,300 --> 00:19:26,260
According to their paper, it worked about as well as Meta's Lambda AI model.

394
00:19:26,260 --> 00:19:27,380
It didn't stay up long though.

395
00:19:27,380 --> 00:19:31,580
They took it down on March 20th because they were concerned about hallucinations.

396
00:19:31,580 --> 00:19:34,340
That's what they call it when computers tell confident lies.

397
00:19:34,340 --> 00:19:36,540
You know, like chat GBT does about half the time.

398
00:19:36,540 --> 00:19:37,940
But the point had been made.

399
00:19:37,940 --> 00:19:41,500
The price of LLMs is going down from billions of dollars to hundreds of dollars and pretty

400
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:43,860
soon people will be making these in their garages.

401
00:19:43,860 --> 00:19:48,180
And since GPT-4, which hasn't been fully released to the public just yet, it has the ability

402
00:19:48,180 --> 00:19:49,980
to write code.

403
00:19:49,980 --> 00:19:53,540
So now you have the ability for AI to write more AI and improve it.

404
00:19:53,540 --> 00:19:56,700
Anybody else feeling like this is kind of spiraling out of control?

405
00:19:56,700 --> 00:20:00,060
It's no wonder that over a thousand tech insiders signed a letter in March to put a pause on

406
00:20:00,060 --> 00:20:02,180
AI development beyond GPT-4.

407
00:20:02,180 --> 00:20:06,420
That's from the Future of Life Institute, which is controversial in its own way.

408
00:20:06,420 --> 00:20:09,020
And there's a heated debate around their intentions, which is a rabbit hole.

409
00:20:09,020 --> 00:20:11,460
I'm just going to have to leave out of this video.

410
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:14,820
But even with the generative AI that's out right now, we've seen a flurry of app creation

411
00:20:14,820 --> 00:20:15,820
using it.

412
00:20:15,820 --> 00:20:19,580
Literally every other day, there's a new crazy world-changing app that makes the news.

413
00:20:19,580 --> 00:20:23,260
Some of it's been the same AI marketing I was talking about before that's nothing new.

414
00:20:23,260 --> 00:20:25,420
But some of it's just bonkers.

415
00:20:25,420 --> 00:20:30,060
Things like mixo.io that create websites in minutes, jasper.ai that writes marketing

416
00:20:30,060 --> 00:20:32,060
and SEO copy for the web.

417
00:20:32,140 --> 00:20:34,860
luca.com that creates AI-generated logos.

418
00:20:34,860 --> 00:20:39,140
tome.app that writes and creates presentations with Dolly and chat GPT.

419
00:20:39,140 --> 00:20:43,940
quillbot.com that paraphrases AI paragraphs so it can pass an AI detector.

420
00:20:43,940 --> 00:20:45,340
Yikes.

421
00:20:45,340 --> 00:20:48,740
There's runway.ml, it's a video editor and image processor.

422
00:20:48,740 --> 00:20:52,020
NVIDIA has an app that lets you draw a simple landscape and it'll just fill in the rest

423
00:20:52,020 --> 00:20:53,340
they call that Canva.

424
00:20:53,340 --> 00:20:57,420
NVIDIA also has a broadcasting app that will basically make your eyes look like it's going

425
00:20:57,420 --> 00:20:58,980
in the direction of the camera.

426
00:20:58,980 --> 00:21:04,220
There's 11labs.io that does voice cloning, sounddraw.io that makes music.

427
00:21:04,220 --> 00:21:07,700
There's agent GPT that lets you build an AI agent that can do anything you can ask it

428
00:21:07,700 --> 00:21:08,700
to do.

429
00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:13,020
And there's futuretools.io which is an AI search engine for AI tools.

430
00:21:13,020 --> 00:21:15,460
By the way, that's just a sample.

431
00:21:15,460 --> 00:21:19,140
There are hundreds of these out there and there are other channels that have reviewed

432
00:21:19,140 --> 00:21:21,060
literally hundreds of these apps.

433
00:21:21,060 --> 00:21:24,100
Again, I'll just point you to those, there's gonna be a link downstairs.

434
00:21:24,100 --> 00:21:28,940
Okay, so when it comes to these new AI tools, my personal theory is that they're just that.

435
00:21:28,940 --> 00:21:30,300
They're tools, you know.

436
00:21:30,300 --> 00:21:33,300
You still need to know what you're doing to get the kind of results that people are talking

437
00:21:33,300 --> 00:21:34,300
about here.

438
00:21:34,300 --> 00:21:35,300
You know, it's like Photoshop.

439
00:21:35,300 --> 00:21:38,460
Just because you have Photoshop doesn't mean that you can do the same thing as a professional

440
00:21:38,460 --> 00:21:39,580
designer can do.

441
00:21:39,580 --> 00:21:40,660
I can attest to this.

442
00:21:40,660 --> 00:21:41,860
I suck at Photoshop.

443
00:21:41,860 --> 00:21:45,540
Actually, there's a great meme that's going around that anybody who's worked in a creative

444
00:21:45,540 --> 00:21:46,540
field will understand.

445
00:21:46,540 --> 00:21:50,700
It says, to replace creatives with AI, clients will need to be able to accurately describe

446
00:21:50,700 --> 00:21:52,780
what they're looking for.

447
00:21:52,780 --> 00:21:53,780
We're safe.

448
00:21:53,780 --> 00:21:54,780
I'm sorry.

449
00:21:54,780 --> 00:21:57,340
As somebody who's worked in that field, I can tell you that made me laugh quite a bit

450
00:21:57,340 --> 00:21:58,340
when I first saw it.

451
00:21:58,380 --> 00:22:03,300
But anyway, to test my theory, I actually dug in to about 10 or so of these apps, and I made

452
00:22:03,300 --> 00:22:07,500
a whole separate video of it where I go through some of these apps, and I try to figure out

453
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:12,340
if I can make them work as a total noob in the way that the demos of these apps say they

454
00:22:12,340 --> 00:22:13,340
can.

455
00:22:13,340 --> 00:22:16,700
And I'm uploading this along with this video to Nebula, because I've just seen a ton of

456
00:22:16,700 --> 00:22:19,540
these videos talking about these crazy things that these apps can do, but I've never actually

457
00:22:19,540 --> 00:22:23,620
seen anybody actually use them, again, outside of those product demos.

458
00:22:23,620 --> 00:22:25,540
So yeah, I gave it a try myself.

459
00:22:25,540 --> 00:22:30,380
Some were garbage, but some I really think I might be using from now on, and trust me,

460
00:22:30,380 --> 00:22:33,980
if a tech adult like me can do cool things with them, then they must be pretty powerful.

461
00:22:33,980 --> 00:22:36,540
So if you're on Nebula, you can watch it right after this video.

462
00:22:36,540 --> 00:22:40,420
If you're not on Nebula, well, here's why you should sign up for it.

463
00:22:40,420 --> 00:22:43,360
Nebula is the premium streaming service that I help start along with some of my friends

464
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:47,860
who just happen to be some of the best educational YouTubers in the world, and I am completely

465
00:22:47,860 --> 00:22:49,500
unbiased in that statement.

466
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:52,940
On Nebula, you can watch our videos ad-free and earlier than everywhere else, and you

467
00:22:52,940 --> 00:22:56,580
can also see Nebula-exclusive videos that you can't find anywhere else, including Real

468
00:22:56,580 --> 00:23:01,100
Engineering's Logistics of D-Day series, Real Science's unbelievably good series

469
00:23:01,100 --> 00:23:05,020
called Becoming Human, and for those with a more big curiosity, you can find my Mysteries

470
00:23:05,020 --> 00:23:08,140
of the Human Body series and my ongoing Forgotten atrocity series.

471
00:23:08,140 --> 00:23:11,820
And something I don't talk about nearly enough is Nebula classes.

472
00:23:11,820 --> 00:23:15,220
This is like some of those other online learning platforms that you may have heard of, but

473
00:23:15,220 --> 00:23:19,820
these classes are run by educational YouTubers, just going full on educational.

474
00:23:19,820 --> 00:23:23,020
You can learn how to produce videos like Volksgeist, how to produce music like Adam

475
00:23:23,020 --> 00:23:27,500
Neely, and how to sue like a lawyer with LegalEagle, and there's new ones added all the time.

476
00:23:27,500 --> 00:23:32,980
And the reason why we made this platform is because YouTube can be a lot.

477
00:23:32,980 --> 00:23:37,040
With the ever-changing algorithm, the AI once again, we're always chasing the content

478
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:40,140
that will work here, and we're always having to be more click-bitty and sensational.

479
00:23:40,140 --> 00:23:43,740
I know you guys hate that, but Nebula is a place where we can just let our hair down

480
00:23:43,740 --> 00:23:45,340
and make the content that we care about.

481
00:23:45,340 --> 00:23:48,740
So if you've ever thought about supporting a YouTuber, this is easily the biggest bang

482
00:23:48,740 --> 00:23:49,740
for your buck.

483
00:23:49,740 --> 00:23:53,180
Because not only are you supporting hundreds of content creators with that one subscription,

484
00:23:53,180 --> 00:23:54,900
you get tons of content in return.

485
00:23:54,900 --> 00:23:58,620
And if you sign up for the link below, you get that for 40% off the annual plan, which

486
00:23:58,620 --> 00:24:01,260
comes out to a little bit over 250 a month.

487
00:24:01,260 --> 00:24:03,980
Which is probably worth it just so you don't have to hear ad reads like this.

488
00:24:03,980 --> 00:24:06,620
So click the link down in the description below to check it out and watch me test out

489
00:24:06,620 --> 00:24:10,500
some of these AI apps, which I can tell you, if you were to test all these apps out yourself,

490
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:13,500
it would cost way more than your Nebula subscription.

491
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:15,220
So boom, you've already saved money.

492
00:24:15,220 --> 00:24:18,660
All right, so to kind of wrap this thing up, I want to kind of talk about some of the issues

493
00:24:18,660 --> 00:24:22,700
that really need to be mentioned, because so much of this topic gets overwhelmed by

494
00:24:22,700 --> 00:24:24,860
the existential dread stuff.

495
00:24:24,860 --> 00:24:29,140
And while I know that's kind of my thing, there are some right here right now problems

496
00:24:29,140 --> 00:24:30,820
that are far more immediate threats.

497
00:24:30,820 --> 00:24:35,060
Obviously, there's issues of jobs being lost to AI, and yeah, this is something to be concerned

498
00:24:35,060 --> 00:24:36,060
about.

499
00:24:36,060 --> 00:24:39,420
But there's also a bit of a debate around this, because one could also make the argument

500
00:24:39,420 --> 00:24:42,740
that these new tools could help employees be more productive and more creative.

501
00:24:42,740 --> 00:24:46,340
Yeah, there's another line that tech bros tend to say, which is your job isn't going

502
00:24:46,340 --> 00:24:50,380
to be replaced by AI, it's going to be replaced by somebody else using AI.

503
00:24:50,380 --> 00:24:53,220
And there's a couple of things that I can point to as perfect examples of that.

504
00:24:53,220 --> 00:24:59,380
So Corridor crew did this all AI animation called Rock, Paper, Scissors, which is incredible.

505
00:24:59,380 --> 00:25:03,860
And also a TikTok creator called Ghostwriter977 made a lot of news recently because he made

506
00:25:03,860 --> 00:25:10,540
a song called Heart on My Sleeve that used Drake's voice in the song, but it was AI-generated.

507
00:25:10,540 --> 00:25:13,580
And it was so good that it got taken down by Drake's people.

508
00:25:13,580 --> 00:25:17,380
And the point there is that, yeah, these guys were able to do amazing things, but these

509
00:25:17,380 --> 00:25:19,420
are extremely talented people.

510
00:25:19,420 --> 00:25:23,740
I mean, you can look at Corridor crew's YouTube page, I mean, they make insane stuff all the

511
00:25:23,740 --> 00:25:24,740
time.

512
00:25:24,740 --> 00:25:26,460
This is just a new tool they've been able to use.

513
00:25:26,460 --> 00:25:29,820
I mean, going back to Photoshop, when it came out, I remember a lot of people were worried

514
00:25:29,820 --> 00:25:34,140
that it was going to put photographers and illustrators out of business, but most professionals

515
00:25:34,140 --> 00:25:37,860
just kind of adapted to it and just started using it and made better stuff than they'd

516
00:25:37,860 --> 00:25:39,380
ever made before in their lives.

517
00:25:39,380 --> 00:25:43,740
I personally do know a few artists that are actually embracing Dolly in mid-journey.

518
00:25:43,740 --> 00:25:46,100
Mostly it's just kind of jumping off points to kind of spark new ideas.

519
00:25:46,100 --> 00:25:49,700
And as a writer, as I showed a minute ago with some of the brainstorming ideas, like

520
00:25:49,700 --> 00:25:52,580
this is a really quick and easy way to push through writer's blog.

521
00:25:52,580 --> 00:25:57,380
I do worry a bit that this could kind of become an Uroboros, like a snake eating its own tail

522
00:25:57,380 --> 00:26:01,900
because if people use these AIs to create online content and then the AI pulls from

523
00:26:01,900 --> 00:26:06,700
that online content to make new content, it just becomes an endless cycle.

524
00:26:06,700 --> 00:26:10,260
There is also the whole debate around the fact that AI is using other people's work

525
00:26:10,260 --> 00:26:14,820
as part of that large language model and stuff, all of which is copyrighted material

526
00:26:14,820 --> 00:26:18,260
and a lot of people are up in arms about that, and I think understandably so.

527
00:26:18,260 --> 00:26:24,020
But also at the same time, again, playing devil's advocate, it's not completely copying

528
00:26:24,020 --> 00:26:25,020
it.

529
00:26:25,020 --> 00:26:28,060
It's kind of using it as an inspiration, which we all do that, don't we?

530
00:26:28,060 --> 00:26:33,500
It's like it also just made the news recently that Ed Sheeran had been sued for possibly

531
00:26:33,500 --> 00:26:39,220
copying the court progression from the song Let's Get It On, but a lot of pop songs use

532
00:26:39,220 --> 00:26:40,220
the same court progressions.

533
00:26:40,220 --> 00:26:44,020
In fact, there were songs before Let's Get It On that used that same court progression,

534
00:26:44,020 --> 00:26:46,300
which is why Ed Sheeran won his lawsuit.

535
00:26:46,300 --> 00:26:49,860
So this is an ongoing debate around art that started long before AI.

536
00:26:49,860 --> 00:26:54,220
It'll be going on long after, but AI does make it a bit more complicated.

537
00:26:54,220 --> 00:26:59,700
Now the pessimist in me does worry that the money people see AI as a cheap or even free

538
00:26:59,700 --> 00:27:03,860
content creator, and that it'll squeeze creative jobs out of existence.

539
00:27:03,860 --> 00:27:08,300
But the optimist in me thinks that humans working with AI could unleash even more mind

540
00:27:08,300 --> 00:27:12,660
bending ideas and that eventually the cream will rise to the top, just like all the tools

541
00:27:12,660 --> 00:27:13,660
from the past did.

542
00:27:13,660 --> 00:27:17,380
Now in fact, as I'm recording this, we'll see if this is still going on when the video

543
00:27:17,380 --> 00:27:21,340
comes out, the WGA is striking in Hollywood.

544
00:27:21,340 --> 00:27:24,740
Part of that is about streaming services and not getting paid well for the streaming services,

545
00:27:24,740 --> 00:27:28,580
but a big part of the argument, a big part of why they're striking right now has to

546
00:27:28,580 --> 00:27:29,580
do with AI.

547
00:27:29,580 --> 00:27:33,980
And I want to just point out a thread that Justine Bateman shared on Twitter, where

548
00:27:33,980 --> 00:27:37,140
she was talking about some of the big issues and things that we can expect to be happening

549
00:27:37,140 --> 00:27:41,940
in the near future with AI for some of the things that they're trying to get ahead of.

550
00:27:41,940 --> 00:27:45,260
She starts by pointing out that she is actually a coder and she has a computer science degree,

551
00:27:45,260 --> 00:27:47,260
so she does know a bit of what she's talking about here.

552
00:27:47,260 --> 00:27:51,140
She points out that AI written scripts and digitally scanned actors already exist.

553
00:27:51,140 --> 00:27:55,580
And actually Bruce Willis made news for signing over his AI rights to his likeness.

554
00:27:55,580 --> 00:27:59,780
This kind of started happening when he came when he was diagnosed with aphasia and couldn't

555
00:27:59,780 --> 00:28:00,900
really perform anymore.

556
00:28:00,900 --> 00:28:05,540
He sold his AI rights so that people could continue to make movies with him in the distant

557
00:28:05,540 --> 00:28:06,540
future.

558
00:28:06,540 --> 00:28:09,700
She points out that in that case, your digital image can be triple and quadruple booked,

559
00:28:09,700 --> 00:28:13,580
so an actor could actually be working multiple projects at the same time.

560
00:28:13,580 --> 00:28:17,620
She suggested in the future that films could be customized for the viewer, meaning people

561
00:28:17,620 --> 00:28:21,460
could just special order a movie if they wanted to.

562
00:28:21,460 --> 00:28:25,100
She uses the example of, I want to film about a panda in a unicorn who saved the world in

563
00:28:25,100 --> 00:28:28,700
a rocket ship and put Bill Murray in it, so you could be watching whatever streaming service

564
00:28:28,700 --> 00:28:32,300
they might offer something where you could just give a text prompt and it will just create

565
00:28:32,300 --> 00:28:35,380
a movie as you wanted to see it.

566
00:28:35,380 --> 00:28:39,740
Which Bill Murray with a panda in a unicorn saving the world in a rocket ship just sounds

567
00:28:39,740 --> 00:28:42,140
like a Wes Anderson movie.

568
00:28:42,140 --> 00:28:45,900
Which actually I'm pretty sure that Wes Anderson at this point is just an AI that's been pre-trained

569
00:28:45,900 --> 00:28:47,780
on Wes Anderson movies.

570
00:28:47,780 --> 00:28:51,620
She points out the possibility of people getting themselves scanned and putting themselves

571
00:28:51,620 --> 00:28:54,820
into films so like you could put your own face on Darth Vader.

572
00:28:54,820 --> 00:28:58,580
She said you could train an AI program on a series and then just create a whole new

573
00:28:58,580 --> 00:29:00,460
season of that series.

574
00:29:00,460 --> 00:29:05,660
And that brings up some really interesting possibilities but my big question is, is that

575
00:29:05,660 --> 00:29:06,660
something people want?

576
00:29:06,660 --> 00:29:09,700
I mean, would you want to see that?

577
00:29:09,700 --> 00:29:13,900
Like there are already programs like Nothing Forever, which is a never ending AI generated

578
00:29:13,900 --> 00:29:16,020
Seinfeld episode.

579
00:29:16,020 --> 00:29:23,140
I mean, who isn't crazy these days?

580
00:29:23,140 --> 00:29:26,700
This is terrible, but it will get better.

581
00:29:26,700 --> 00:29:31,020
And actually the Nothing Forever thing, it's streaming on Twitch, they took it down because

582
00:29:31,020 --> 00:29:34,900
it started using homophobic slurs.

583
00:29:34,900 --> 00:29:35,900
So there's that.

584
00:29:35,900 --> 00:29:40,500
Yeah, you know, computers doing all the creative stuff while people keep working in factories

585
00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:44,020
for lower and lower paying jobs is not the future I was hoping for.

586
00:29:44,020 --> 00:29:48,700
Now as for administrative and legal jobs and whatnot that's under threat by AI, that

587
00:29:48,700 --> 00:29:50,300
I don't think is anything new.

588
00:29:50,300 --> 00:29:52,460
I don't mean to minimize that as a threat.

589
00:29:52,460 --> 00:29:56,220
It definitely is to a lot of people, but that's a trend that's been going on for quite some

590
00:29:56,220 --> 00:29:57,220
time now.

591
00:29:57,220 --> 00:30:00,460
And again, I think the more familiar you are with these tools, the safer your job's going

592
00:30:00,460 --> 00:30:03,420
to be, but there are a lot of takes on that subject.

593
00:30:03,420 --> 00:30:08,580
Now one area of AI that did put me on my heels is that of AI and warfare.

594
00:30:08,580 --> 00:30:12,580
I talked a little bit about AI in my episode on the future of war, but that's a debate

595
00:30:12,580 --> 00:30:14,380
that's only getting bigger and more confusing.

596
00:30:14,380 --> 00:30:18,540
AI gets used in a lot of ways by the military from image processing to logistics, but what

597
00:30:18,540 --> 00:30:23,060
about AI's having the power to decide if a person lives or dies?

598
00:30:23,060 --> 00:30:26,780
Like just the fact that, you know, drones were conducting strikes controlled by an operator

599
00:30:26,780 --> 00:30:30,580
hundreds of miles away, like that was iffy at the time when that started being a thing.

600
00:30:30,580 --> 00:30:34,540
But now the debate is whether or not an AI should be allowed to make that decision.

601
00:30:34,540 --> 00:30:38,700
But even bigger than that, way bigger than that, is that increasingly there's been talk

602
00:30:38,700 --> 00:30:41,100
about giving AI the ability to launch nuclear weapons.

603
00:30:41,100 --> 00:30:45,060
I think I need a lighting change.

604
00:30:45,060 --> 00:30:49,060
So back in the 80s, the Soviets instituted a dead hand mechanism on their nuclear arsenal.

605
00:30:49,060 --> 00:30:52,620
This was in the event that, you know, decision makers might get wiped out in a nuclear strike

606
00:30:52,620 --> 00:30:56,340
on Moscow, it would automatically trigger all their nukes to fire at the U.S.

607
00:30:56,340 --> 00:31:00,420
Now you could say this was kind of an early algorithm or automation of the nuclear arsenal.

608
00:31:00,420 --> 00:31:04,180
And similarly, the U.S. has contingencies in place in the event of a first strike scenario,

609
00:31:04,740 --> 00:31:08,780
but that time horizon on first strike has gotten smaller and smaller over the years.

610
00:31:08,780 --> 00:31:11,380
First ICBMs could reach the U.S. in about 30 minutes.

611
00:31:11,380 --> 00:31:13,820
The nuclear submarines cut that time in half.

612
00:31:13,820 --> 00:31:17,460
Today we're seeing the birth of hypersonic missiles that could cut that in half yet again.

613
00:31:17,460 --> 00:31:21,820
So now in a nuclear scenario, military leaders may have less than seven minutes to make a

614
00:31:21,820 --> 00:31:24,060
decision and retaliate.

615
00:31:24,060 --> 00:31:28,100
And that's led many to consider handing those decisions over to AI to save precious seconds.

616
00:31:28,100 --> 00:31:33,500
So when we talk about an AI arms race, this is the ultimate version of that.

617
00:31:33,500 --> 00:31:38,580
We could see a day in the very near future where the U.S., China, and Russia all had their

618
00:31:38,580 --> 00:31:40,380
nuclear arsenals controlled by AI.

619
00:31:40,380 --> 00:31:48,060
AI that we don't fully understand or control with the ability to wipe out all life on Earth.

620
00:31:48,060 --> 00:31:51,860
Anyway, just something to think about.

621
00:31:51,860 --> 00:31:56,820
Ultimately, I think what we're dealing with here really is just an amplifier.

622
00:31:56,820 --> 00:32:00,220
It's a highly evolving set of tools that can make production more productive, create

623
00:32:00,220 --> 00:32:05,420
as more creative, bad actors and the worst actors, scammers more successful, and weapons

624
00:32:05,420 --> 00:32:06,420
more deadly.

625
00:32:06,420 --> 00:32:10,620
It's the Wild West right now, and we really don't know where this goes.

626
00:32:10,620 --> 00:32:13,820
And I can hear all the comments already of people saying, you forgot about this, you forgot

627
00:32:13,820 --> 00:32:14,820
about that.

628
00:32:14,820 --> 00:32:18,340
Yeah, there's a lot that I left out of this video because it's just too much.

629
00:32:18,340 --> 00:32:23,700
This is already way too long of a video, and writing this kind of broke my brain.

630
00:32:23,700 --> 00:32:27,500
The whole thing just gives me like a grandma migraine headache.

631
00:32:27,500 --> 00:32:32,060
Like not here or here so much, but like right here.

632
00:32:32,060 --> 00:32:35,620
So any one of the topics that I brought up here and any of the things that I left out

633
00:32:35,620 --> 00:32:38,820
for that matter could be entire videos of their own.

634
00:32:38,820 --> 00:32:42,700
So yeah, if this video does well and you guys want to see a video on any of those topics,

635
00:32:42,700 --> 00:32:43,700
let me know.

636
00:32:43,700 --> 00:32:44,700
Maybe I'll do them.

637
00:32:44,700 --> 00:32:47,380
And also, there's a ton of videos and creators doing great work on this topic.

638
00:32:47,380 --> 00:32:50,380
Again, I'm going to put links down in the description so you guys can go check it out.

639
00:32:50,380 --> 00:32:54,620
I encourage you to do so because we got to stay on top of this.

640
00:32:54,620 --> 00:32:55,620
The genie's out of the bottle.

641
00:32:55,980 --> 00:32:59,820
But I think I'll leave things off with a quote from Jeffrey Hinton, who's often called

642
00:32:59,820 --> 00:33:00,820
the godfather of AI.

643
00:33:00,820 --> 00:33:03,860
He's been working on AI in neural nets since the 80s.

644
00:33:03,860 --> 00:33:05,660
And he was working with Google until recently.

645
00:33:05,660 --> 00:33:09,980
He actually, he left Google so that he could speak freely about this subject.

646
00:33:09,980 --> 00:33:12,380
He recently said this in an interview with CBS.

647
00:33:12,380 --> 00:33:17,980
This is the biggest technological advancement since, is this another industrial revolution?

648
00:33:17,980 --> 00:33:18,980
What is this?

649
00:33:18,980 --> 00:33:20,300
How should people think of it?

650
00:33:20,300 --> 00:33:24,860
I think it's comparable in scale with the industrial revolution or electricity.

651
00:33:25,580 --> 00:33:27,580
Or maybe the wheel.

652
00:33:27,580 --> 00:33:29,580
Or maybe the wheel.

653
00:33:29,580 --> 00:33:30,580
Yeah.

654
00:33:30,580 --> 00:33:32,580
That was earlier.

655
00:33:32,580 --> 00:33:33,580
Yeah.

656
00:33:33,580 --> 00:33:34,580
Okay.

657
00:33:34,580 --> 00:33:35,580
So buckle up.

658
00:33:35,580 --> 00:33:36,580
Yeah.

659
00:33:36,580 --> 00:33:37,580
All right.

660
00:33:37,580 --> 00:33:38,580
Thanks a lot for watching.

661
00:33:38,580 --> 00:33:40,660
