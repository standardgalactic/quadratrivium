00:00.000 --> 00:05.180
There was a period of time on 9-11 when nobody knew what was going on.

00:05.180 --> 00:07.660
A plane had hit the World Trade Center.

00:07.660 --> 00:08.940
Everybody on the news was talking about it.

00:08.940 --> 00:12.260
There were rumors that other planes had been hijacked, that there was some kind of major

00:12.260 --> 00:14.900
attack, but nobody knew for sure.

00:14.900 --> 00:19.060
There were all kinds of crazy rumors swirling around, but in that moment, it was just as

00:19.060 --> 00:23.660
likely that this was just a horrible accident, just a thing that went wrong, and nothing

00:23.660 --> 00:28.020
more than that.

00:28.020 --> 00:30.140
And then the second tower was hit.

00:30.140 --> 00:35.140
That was the moment that all the confusion went away, and we all collectively realized

00:35.140 --> 00:40.600
at the exact same time, oh, we're living in a different world now.

00:40.600 --> 00:43.780
I think we're kind of having that moment right now with AI.

00:43.780 --> 00:47.020
For the last 10 years or so, we have been hearing about how this technology is going

00:47.020 --> 00:48.020
to change the world.

00:48.020 --> 00:50.860
It's going to take all of our jobs, leave society unrecognizable.

00:50.860 --> 00:55.540
There's just been this background anxiety about it, what AI could do, but for the most

00:55.540 --> 01:00.140
part, it was just like an abstract thing that we couldn't really see or imagine.

01:00.140 --> 01:03.940
But some recent advancements have made this abstract thing a lot more clear.

01:03.940 --> 01:11.060
AIs that can generate articles, music, images, video, and code, meaning they could create

01:11.060 --> 01:12.060
more AIs.

01:12.060 --> 01:15.940
There are even people using AIs to build and run businesses, all by themselves, making

01:15.940 --> 01:17.420
thousands of dollars a day.

01:17.420 --> 01:20.780
At the very least, these are the new tools that in five years or so, you're going to

01:20.780 --> 01:22.860
be at a disadvantage if you don't know how to use them.

01:22.860 --> 01:26.100
And at the very most, we're seeing just the tip of the iceberg of a technology that will

01:26.100 --> 01:30.700
radically reshape our society in ways that we can't possibly comprehend.

01:30.700 --> 01:34.780
What we're seeing right now is AI's second tower moment.

01:34.780 --> 01:38.860
Whichever way this goes, we're in a different world now.

01:38.860 --> 01:45.180
All right, so this is a video about what's going on with AI right now.

01:45.180 --> 01:52.500
And the thing is, what's going on with AI right now is it's changing extremely fast.

01:52.620 --> 01:56.380
There are entire channels dedicated to following this stuff that post multiple times a week

01:56.380 --> 02:00.860
and they're struggling to keep up, so the idea that this video is going to be timely

02:00.860 --> 02:01.860
is just laughable.

02:01.860 --> 02:04.740
Yeah, things have happened since you started watching this video that already makes this

02:04.740 --> 02:05.740
video obsolete.

02:05.740 --> 02:08.140
And that's kind of the whole point.

02:08.140 --> 02:12.740
For years we've been hearing about the idea of the singularity, the moment that AI outpaces

02:12.740 --> 02:15.860
us and the unimaginable becomes real.

02:15.860 --> 02:17.820
I covered it a few times early on in this channel.

02:17.820 --> 02:21.380
And I've been making the argument actually for the most part that when you step back

02:21.380 --> 02:25.620
and you scale things back and look at the big picture, we're in the singularity.

02:25.620 --> 02:26.940
We've been in it for a couple hundred years.

02:26.940 --> 02:31.340
Yeah, I kind of got away from the idea that the singularity was this one single event,

02:31.340 --> 02:34.020
just one moment when everything changed all at once.

02:34.020 --> 02:38.020
I started seeing it as an era of history that began maybe with the birth of the Industrial

02:38.020 --> 02:41.900
Revolution when we learned how to harness energy or maybe even the invention of the

02:41.900 --> 02:45.540
printing press and we learned how to pass information on through space and time.

02:45.540 --> 02:47.180
Everything just kind of hockey sticks after that.

02:47.500 --> 02:52.740
But what's been happening lately is starting to feel like the classic version of the singularity.

02:52.740 --> 02:53.740
You know?

02:53.740 --> 02:56.980
Like we're just rolling downhill and about to cross the event horizon of this thing where

02:56.980 --> 02:58.380
there's no going back.

02:58.380 --> 03:00.060
Hyperbole much, Joe?

03:02.620 --> 03:03.620
I don't know.

03:03.620 --> 03:05.340
I mean, not if you listen to the hype around it.

03:05.340 --> 03:08.940
Judging on the hype that you've been hearing about AI, this could go in two very different

03:08.940 --> 03:09.940
ways.

03:09.940 --> 03:14.300
On one hand, AI could solve all of our problems, cure cancer, create new methods of propulsion

03:14.300 --> 03:15.660
and clean energy.

03:15.660 --> 03:19.380
All the issues we're currently dealing with that we fear will destroy us someday, AI could

03:19.380 --> 03:23.900
be an unimaginably powerful tool to solve those problems.

03:23.900 --> 03:25.380
This is one possible outcome.

03:25.380 --> 03:30.740
But then there's the other outcome, where in an inconceivably short time AI becomes smarter

03:30.740 --> 03:35.060
than us, it becomes an intelligence we can't possibly fathom, leading to the extinction

03:35.060 --> 03:36.060
of the human race.

03:36.060 --> 03:40.860
And to me anyway, no discussion of AI is possible without talking about both the good and the

03:40.860 --> 03:41.860
bad.

03:41.860 --> 03:44.580
So that's what I'm going to try to do here.

03:44.580 --> 03:45.580
And it's difficult.

03:45.580 --> 03:49.060
I'm trying really hard, guys.

03:49.060 --> 03:53.820
Honestly, I have had to restart this video like four or five different times, because

03:53.820 --> 03:58.340
every time I thought that I was done, I would find some article or see some video that kind

03:58.340 --> 04:02.940
of threw my entire point out the window and I would have to start all over again.

04:02.940 --> 04:06.580
There's just so many takes on this subject and it's not that any of them are wrong, actually

04:06.580 --> 04:08.700
the problem is that a lot of them are right.

04:08.700 --> 04:09.700
They're probably all right.

04:09.700 --> 04:11.420
In fact, one of them got into eugenics.

04:11.420 --> 04:12.420
I didn't see that coming.

04:12.420 --> 04:15.300
I mean, nobody even knows exactly how these things work.

04:15.300 --> 04:19.340
Even the experts that have been working on this for decades, so like how am I supposed

04:19.340 --> 04:21.300
to add anything to this conversation?

04:21.300 --> 04:23.940
Like what can I possibly say that hasn't already been said?

04:23.940 --> 04:26.740
And if I'm being honest, I haven't even really been keeping up with this.

04:26.740 --> 04:30.300
There's like a 50,000 AI apps out there and I haven't been able to mess with any of them

04:30.300 --> 04:32.420
because I'm always just trying to get the next video out.

04:32.420 --> 04:35.540
So not only am I trying to make an informative video out of this thing, I've got to get

04:35.540 --> 04:38.860
caught up on a technology that I've been following way behind on like I couldn't feel

04:38.860 --> 04:40.860
more older and out of touch.

04:40.860 --> 04:43.940
And the biggest irony of all is that I'm sitting here struggling really hard to write a script

04:43.940 --> 04:48.100
about a technology whose core value is that it can write the script for me.

04:48.100 --> 04:50.740
Maybe I should just pick up where my last AI video left off.

04:50.740 --> 04:53.420
When was the last time I made a video about AI?

04:53.420 --> 04:57.260
My last video on AI was in 2016.

04:57.260 --> 04:58.260
Wow.

04:58.260 --> 05:02.780
Oh, there's a little baby YouTuber back then.

05:02.780 --> 05:05.900
Okay, so yeah, the last video was talking about the three different levels of AI.

05:05.900 --> 05:07.940
So why don't we just do a quick refresher on that?

05:07.940 --> 05:08.940
All right.

05:08.940 --> 05:09.940
Let's take a quick picture.

05:09.940 --> 05:11.860
When we talk about AI, there's three different levels.

05:11.860 --> 05:15.540
There's artificial narrow intelligence, artificial general intelligence, and artificial super

05:15.540 --> 05:16.540
intelligence.

05:16.540 --> 05:19.380
Narrow AI is what we've been dealing with for a long time now.

05:19.380 --> 05:24.580
This has taken the form of chatbots to spell check, image processing that helps with photography,

05:24.580 --> 05:27.260
astronomy, medical diagnostics, and so on.

05:27.260 --> 05:28.940
Voice recognition is a kind of AI.

05:28.940 --> 05:30.460
Virtual assistance like Siri and Alexa.

05:30.460 --> 05:33.860
There's all kinds of AI in gaming, aviation, search engines.

05:33.860 --> 05:34.860
The list goes on.

05:34.860 --> 05:38.580
AI's help make our jobs easier and our lives more efficient in a million different ways.

05:38.580 --> 05:41.540
It's also manipulated our society in ways we're just now beginning to come to grips

05:41.540 --> 05:42.540
with.

05:42.540 --> 05:45.940
All the polarization, isolation, depression that we've been seeing by social media, these

05:45.940 --> 05:50.060
are products of algorithms that are themselves a kind of AI.

05:50.060 --> 05:53.500
I know some of the biggest algorithm experts at YouTube, and I can tell you they're just

05:53.500 --> 05:57.020
trying to figure it out like the rest of us, only they have millions of channels worth

05:57.020 --> 05:59.540
of data to deal with versus one or a few channels.

05:59.540 --> 06:02.220
Yeah, the algorithm is basically like an alien life form.

06:02.220 --> 06:03.980
Nobody really knows how it works.

06:03.980 --> 06:09.140
It's a black box that nobody can see inside of or understand, much less control.

06:09.140 --> 06:10.460
This is the point that will come up later.

06:10.460 --> 06:14.180
Yeah, all of these AI's are amazing and powerful, but they're all examples of, again, narrow

06:14.180 --> 06:15.180
AI.

06:15.180 --> 06:18.380
They're built and trained to do one specific thing, and they do that one specific thing

06:18.380 --> 06:21.500
better than any person could, but that's all they can do.

06:21.500 --> 06:25.100
And we're already seeing this bifurcation of scenarios, you know, simultaneously incredible

06:25.100 --> 06:28.740
and amazing, but also tearing apart the fabric of society.

06:28.740 --> 06:32.500
Artificial general intelligence is AI that can do all the things that narrow AI can do,

06:32.500 --> 06:33.500
but for everything.

06:33.780 --> 06:35.900
It's a generalist, much more like a human being.

06:35.900 --> 06:37.260
I want to make sure that I'm clear here.

06:37.260 --> 06:40.180
I'm not talking about consciousness or sentience at this point.

06:40.180 --> 06:41.420
This isn't an artificial life form.

06:41.420 --> 06:44.180
We're not talking about giving it personhood or rights or anything.

06:44.180 --> 06:47.740
In fact, the consciousness thing, it doesn't even play into this conversation right now.

06:47.740 --> 06:51.680
I think it's better to just kind of set that aside.

06:51.680 --> 06:53.780
That muddy's waters that are already pretty muddy.

06:53.780 --> 06:57.540
A general AI is just AI that can have the same capacities as a human brain.

06:57.540 --> 07:00.700
It can analyze images, but it can also make music.

07:00.700 --> 07:02.780
It can problem solve and strategize.

07:02.780 --> 07:04.460
It can deceive and manipulate.

07:04.460 --> 07:08.500
Here's the thing about artificial general intelligence, though, when it does happen,

07:08.500 --> 07:09.500
you'll probably miss it.

07:09.500 --> 07:14.220
Because if an AI has the same capacity that we have, well, one of the capacities that

07:14.220 --> 07:16.660
we have is that we can make an AI smarter.

07:16.660 --> 07:23.220
So if an AI that's as smart as we are can create a smarter AI, that by definition is

07:23.220 --> 07:25.060
artificial superintelligence.

07:25.060 --> 07:28.660
This is what futurists have been saying for a long time now, that pretty much the instant

07:28.660 --> 07:32.620
we reach artificial general intelligence, we will reach artificial superintelligence.

07:32.620 --> 07:35.140
AI that's smarter than a human.

07:35.140 --> 07:37.020
Smarter than all humans combined for that matter.

07:37.020 --> 07:40.460
And this is where things really split into a couple of different directions.

07:40.460 --> 07:45.380
On one hand, we could see a utopia where every disease has a cure, aging can be reversed,

07:45.380 --> 07:50.620
resources perfectly allocated for all, the climate and equilibrium, economic recessions,

07:50.620 --> 07:54.780
forever eradicated, all our wants and needs fulfilled, so we can spend our limitless lives

07:54.780 --> 07:57.020
and pursue knowledge and happiness.

07:57.020 --> 08:00.460
We're in an effort to get rid of all conflict that suppresses us all into an authoritarian

08:00.460 --> 08:04.460
surveillance state devoid of free will, with all of our wants and needs doled out according

08:04.460 --> 08:09.340
to its all-powerful insistence on order, creating a techno-slave state.

08:09.340 --> 08:12.860
Or it could decide that the common denominator in all the world's problems is humanity itself

08:12.860 --> 08:16.100
and wipes us out the face of the earth, replacing us with robots and machines that live on for

08:16.100 --> 08:19.580
a billion years, eventually spreading to distant stars and eradicating all potential life in

08:19.580 --> 08:26.860
the universe from existence.

08:27.860 --> 08:33.380
There is, of course, another option, which is that all of this is just hype.

08:33.380 --> 08:37.340
Just way overblown hype by companies who invested billions of dollars into this and

08:37.340 --> 08:39.060
now need to sell the product they made.

08:39.060 --> 08:42.380
In fact, there's an argument to be made that this is just another gold rush.

08:42.380 --> 08:44.220
AI is the new crypto.

08:44.220 --> 08:48.060
And there definitely is a gold rush of sorts going on with all these new AI tools suddenly

08:48.060 --> 08:52.380
being integrated in everything with a keyboard, some of which are awesome, yeah, but some

08:52.380 --> 08:54.820
of which just don't make any bloody sense.

08:54.820 --> 08:56.820
But really, this isn't anything new.

08:56.820 --> 09:00.380
Technology has been using AI as a catch-all buzzword for the last decade.

09:00.380 --> 09:03.300
It's just like this thing that they say to convince you to buy their product and say

09:03.300 --> 09:06.900
that their product is better because it has AI in it, you know, everything from cars to

09:06.900 --> 09:10.420
HVAC units to washing machines, coffee makers.

09:10.420 --> 09:16.020
Tech investors need to beware, 40% of companies in Europe are now claimed to be AI startups

09:16.020 --> 09:20.140
have actually, if you can believe this, little or no connection with artificial intelligence

09:20.140 --> 09:21.140
at all.

09:21.140 --> 09:25.540
Now, in these cases, the AI is usually just like an algorithm that allows a device to

09:25.580 --> 09:27.860
self-adjust or optimize according to the situation.

09:27.860 --> 09:32.380
And they've got their merits, you know, as the kind of narrow AI I was just talking about.

09:32.380 --> 09:33.940
But it is also just marketing.

09:33.940 --> 09:36.420
So, yeah, on one hand, AI is nothing new.

09:36.420 --> 09:39.220
It's been used to sell us on products for a long time.

09:39.220 --> 09:42.220
What we're dealing with right now, though, is something different.

09:42.220 --> 09:43.660
This is generative AI.

09:43.660 --> 09:46.460
Not to be confused with general AI that I was talking about a second ago.

09:46.460 --> 09:49.220
Generative AI, though, it's exactly what it sounds like.

09:49.220 --> 09:51.820
It's AI that generates something that didn't exist before.

09:51.860 --> 09:55.780
And this does feel like it just kind of popped up out of nowhere in the last couple of years.

09:55.780 --> 09:59.860
But again, it's really just a culmination of a lot of things we've been getting used

09:59.860 --> 10:01.020
to for a while now.

10:01.020 --> 10:04.380
We kind of started seeing the first sparks of this back in 2015 when videos like this

10:04.380 --> 10:07.940
from Google's Deep Dream Project started kind of making their way around the Internet.

10:07.940 --> 10:11.700
The AI would basically start off with a picture and then it would find patterns in that picture

10:11.700 --> 10:15.380
and the alignment of pixels and whatnot that it would recognize as other images, kind of

10:15.380 --> 10:17.820
like us seeing faces or shapes in the clouds.

10:17.820 --> 10:21.020
It would then pull from a set of images and insert them into the image leading to these

10:21.020 --> 10:25.540
mind-bidding visuals of animals and faces reminiscent of a heroic dose of mushrooms.

10:25.540 --> 10:27.460
Or so I've heard.

10:27.460 --> 10:31.820
Following that, the research continued into training AI models to recognize objects and

10:31.820 --> 10:32.820
images.

10:32.820 --> 10:35.300
That's pretty much what all those captures were all about, finding the stoplights and

10:35.300 --> 10:36.300
the cars in the images.

10:36.300 --> 10:39.300
You've been training AI models this whole time and didn't even know it.

10:39.300 --> 10:42.780
You also started to see tools in Photoshop like content-aware fill and scale that will

10:42.780 --> 10:46.860
intelligently replace objects and add extra photo to the photo based on the space around

10:46.860 --> 10:47.860
it.

10:47.860 --> 10:49.300
That got fully integrated into Photoshop in 2019.

10:49.340 --> 10:51.660
I actually use this all the time on my thumbnails.

10:51.660 --> 10:55.780
And then there's the AI video and image filters that started on Snapchat and then on TikTok.

10:55.780 --> 10:59.860
Then there was a trend of AI-generated avatars and social media through apps like Lenza.

10:59.860 --> 11:02.980
I'm leaving a lot out, but the point is that all of these little AI tools and toys have

11:02.980 --> 11:05.740
been around for years and becoming more and more popular.

11:05.740 --> 11:08.700
Now at the same time that all this was happening, there were AI's that were learning natural

11:08.700 --> 11:09.820
language patterns.

11:09.820 --> 11:14.380
The first autocorrect features and word processors went back as far as 2003, but it became especially

11:14.380 --> 11:16.300
useful with the advent of smartphones.

11:16.300 --> 11:19.940
A lot of text and phones and search engines soon followed, voice recognition paired with

11:19.940 --> 11:23.500
natural language models led to Siri in 2011, Alexa in 2014.

11:23.500 --> 11:28.380
And then in 2021, OpenAI announced Dahle, which put the image and text features together

11:28.380 --> 11:31.900
and had the ability to create entirely new images based off of text prompts.

11:31.900 --> 11:35.940
All that labeling of objects and text recognition at all kind of came together so that if you

11:35.940 --> 11:40.620
entered the word camel, it knows what a camel is and it can search its massive image archive

11:40.620 --> 11:42.620
and it creates something that resembles a camel.

11:42.620 --> 11:44.860
The first Dahle was kind of under the radar though.

11:44.860 --> 11:46.380
It was kind of just made for research purposes.

11:46.380 --> 11:49.740
It was Dahle 2 that came out last year in 2022.

11:49.740 --> 11:52.540
That's what gave public access to this technology for the first time.

11:52.540 --> 11:56.100
Mid Journey came out about the same time and people kind of lost their minds.

11:56.100 --> 12:00.580
For the first time, literally anybody could just enter some words into a prompt and get

12:00.580 --> 12:02.380
a pretty good quality image out of it.

12:02.380 --> 12:05.060
And yet anybody who's been following this even a little bit can attest to how quickly

12:05.060 --> 12:06.900
this AI art has evolved.

12:06.900 --> 12:11.300
And then by the time we got used to all that, here comes ChatGPT.

12:11.300 --> 12:12.300
ChatGPT.

12:12.300 --> 12:13.300
ChatGPT.

12:13.300 --> 12:14.300
ChatGPT.

12:14.300 --> 12:15.300
ChatGPT.

12:15.300 --> 12:16.300
ChatGPT.

12:16.300 --> 12:17.300
ChatGPT.

12:17.300 --> 12:18.300
ChatGPT.

12:18.300 --> 12:19.300
ChatGPT.

12:19.300 --> 12:20.300
ChatGPT.

12:20.300 --> 12:23.780
Okay, so ChatGPT, in case you don't already know, it works off what's called a large

12:23.780 --> 12:25.580
language model or LLM.

12:25.580 --> 12:27.100
LLMs are neural networks.

12:27.100 --> 12:31.660
A neural network is a computer system that basically works like a brain.

12:31.660 --> 12:35.300
Just as a brain has billions of connections between neurons, LLMs have billions of connections

12:35.300 --> 12:37.900
between mathematical functions that act like neurons.

12:37.900 --> 12:40.340
I don't want to go too deep into how all this works, but I'll just quote a tweet from

12:40.340 --> 12:43.060
Peter Yang, a creator of Economy SO, who said this quote.

12:43.060 --> 12:46.300
Imagine that you have a library with a huge collection of books.

12:46.300 --> 12:49.180
You want to learn everything you can from these books, such as how to write a good essay

12:49.180 --> 12:51.140
and how to speak a foreign language.

12:51.140 --> 12:52.140
How can you do that?

12:52.140 --> 12:55.940
An LLM is a program that can generate text based off the books in your library.

12:55.940 --> 12:59.740
So it does kind of work just like predictive text on your phone.

12:59.740 --> 13:03.540
Where a phone has a library of a past text, it can kind of figure out what the most likely

13:03.540 --> 13:04.540
next word is going to be.

13:04.540 --> 13:07.420
So I'll say if you start to type your street address, it's learn that from watching your

13:07.420 --> 13:09.180
text and it autocompletes it.

13:09.180 --> 13:13.020
Only an LLM has millions upon millions of books and articles to draw from, and then

13:13.020 --> 13:15.460
they kind of weigh what they read in terms of importance.

13:15.460 --> 13:19.340
To be clear, this is a massive oversimplification, but you get the idea.

13:19.340 --> 13:22.980
The process of feeding an LLM gobs of text is called pre-training.

13:22.980 --> 13:26.700
When programmers want LLMs to get better at specific tasks, they can feed the LLM more

13:26.700 --> 13:27.700
focused text.

13:27.700 --> 13:28.700
This is called fine-tuning.

13:28.700 --> 13:31.820
But it's not really interesting giving the right answer.

13:31.820 --> 13:34.580
It's programmed to give the most likely answer.

13:34.580 --> 13:36.060
And a lot of times that answer's right.

13:36.060 --> 13:38.620
A lot of times it's not.

13:38.620 --> 13:42.780
For example, when I asked chatGbt to give me five facts about the YouTuber Joe Scott,

13:42.780 --> 13:43.780
this is what I got.

13:43.780 --> 13:47.340
Joe Scott is an American science communicator and YouTuber who creates videos about science,

13:47.340 --> 13:48.340
space, and technology.

13:48.340 --> 13:52.580
He's been creating content on YouTube since 2014 and has over 1.5 million subscribers.

13:52.580 --> 13:53.580
Accurate.

13:53.580 --> 13:56.500
Before becoming a full-time YouTuber, Joe worked as an engineer and consultant in the

13:56.500 --> 13:57.500
aerospace industry.

13:57.500 --> 14:01.300
He has a degree in aerospace engineering and a master's degree in systems engineering.

14:02.300 --> 14:04.180
This is not true.

14:04.180 --> 14:07.660
Joe is known for his informative and well-researched videos which cover a wide range of scientific

14:07.660 --> 14:11.620
topics from black holes in space exploration to artificial intelligence and genetics.

14:11.620 --> 14:12.740
Well done, chatGbt.

14:12.740 --> 14:15.820
In addition to his main channel, he has a second channel called Answers with Joe, where

14:15.820 --> 14:17.900
he explores interesting questions that provide answers.

14:17.900 --> 14:18.900
That's...

14:18.900 --> 14:22.780
The second channel's called TMI, so swing and a miss.

14:22.780 --> 14:25.180
Joe is an advocate for science education and outreach.

14:25.180 --> 14:26.460
Sure, that's true.

14:26.460 --> 14:30.740
He has spoken at events such as TEDx and collaborated with organizations such as NASA and the Planetary

14:30.740 --> 14:35.980
Society to help promote science, literacy, and interest in space exploration.

14:35.980 --> 14:36.980
I wish that were true.

14:36.980 --> 14:41.460
So yeah, out of five questions, two of them were completely bloody wrong and one of them

14:41.460 --> 14:42.940
was kind of half wrong.

14:42.940 --> 14:46.220
So also when I was messing around, I asked it to give me directions to the closest roller

14:46.220 --> 14:49.700
skating rink to where I live in East Dallas and it pointed me to a nice little skating

14:49.700 --> 14:54.220
rink at the corner of Gus Thomason and Ferguson, but when I looked it up on Google, it's actually

14:54.220 --> 14:57.020
way up in Plano about 10 miles away.

14:57.020 --> 15:02.220
So yeah, when people ask me if I use chatGPT to write my scripts for me, my answer is not

15:02.220 --> 15:03.700
just no, but hell no.

15:03.700 --> 15:07.860
In fact, the first time I ever really tried to do that, I was doing a video on smart cities.

15:07.860 --> 15:10.780
I tried to save a little time and asked it to write a few paragraphs about the planned

15:10.780 --> 15:14.020
city of Tulosa, Arizona, and it gave me this.

15:14.020 --> 15:17.500
Tulosa is a bustling metropolis located in the heart of the country with a population

15:17.500 --> 15:18.500
of over 2 million people.

15:18.500 --> 15:22.020
It's one of the largest cities in the nation and a major center of commerce, culture, and

15:22.020 --> 15:23.020
entertainment.

15:23.020 --> 15:26.700
The city is home to a diverse array of people with a rich mix of cultures, religions, and

15:26.700 --> 15:29.780
backgrounds, making it a vibrant and exciting place to live and visit.

15:29.780 --> 15:33.620
Tulosa is a cultural hotspot with numerous museums, galleries, and theaters showcasing

15:33.620 --> 15:37.460
the best in art, music, and performance, and it's home to many renowned musical and

15:37.460 --> 15:40.580
theater productions, as well as countless festivals and events that take place throughout

15:40.580 --> 15:41.580
the year.

15:41.580 --> 15:47.660
Yeah, um, this city does not exist.

15:47.660 --> 15:49.740
It's literally just computer renderings right now.

15:49.740 --> 15:53.940
Now I will say I've used it to help create video titles for my videos and it's been

15:53.940 --> 15:55.140
pretty helpful with that.

15:55.140 --> 15:58.660
And also, while I was testing it out, I thought I would try seeing if it could help me brainstorm

15:58.660 --> 16:01.940
some ideas about a character that doesn't really exist.

16:01.940 --> 16:05.420
Say I'm writing a book and I made up this character about a farmer who's about to go

16:05.420 --> 16:06.420
bankrupt.

16:06.420 --> 16:09.620
The prompt I gave it was, I'm writing a story featuring a character that's a farmer trying

16:09.620 --> 16:11.420
to keep the family farm from going bankrupt.

16:11.420 --> 16:14.140
He's a tough man struggling to keep himself together for his family.

16:14.140 --> 16:16.100
What are some quirky characteristics I could give him?

16:16.100 --> 16:18.540
And it gave me these options of superstitious.

16:18.540 --> 16:21.740
Your farmer could have a collection of unusual, lucky charms or rituals that he believes will

16:22.140 --> 16:28.260
bring good fortune to the farm, talks to animals, collects unusual items, expert whistler,

16:28.260 --> 16:34.660
green thumb for unconventional plants, fear of modern technology, expert storyteller,

16:34.660 --> 16:36.820
proclivity for inventing gadgets.

16:36.820 --> 16:37.940
This is pretty good.

16:37.940 --> 16:40.100
Like, like that's seriously helpful.

16:40.100 --> 16:41.460
I could actually use that.

16:41.460 --> 16:45.980
Oh, and I also asked it to recite the to be or not to be speech in the style of Snoop Dogg.

16:45.980 --> 16:50.340
Um, I was kind of hoping to see a to be or not to bizzle, but I didn't get that.

16:50.340 --> 16:52.060
But I did get a matter of seconds.

16:52.060 --> 16:56.500
It created a whole rap verse that's honestly pretty impressive.

16:56.500 --> 16:57.500
Okay.

16:57.500 --> 16:59.380
Now I am not a power user of chat GPT.

16:59.380 --> 17:02.500
There's a million videos out there with great advice on how to create the best prompts to

17:02.500 --> 17:03.500
get what you want.

17:03.500 --> 17:06.140
I'll just direct you to some of those down in the description.

17:06.140 --> 17:10.700
By the way, my prediction is that the word prompts is the word of the year for 2023.

17:10.700 --> 17:11.700
Get used to that word.

17:11.700 --> 17:12.700
You're going to be hearing it a lot.

17:12.700 --> 17:17.060
So yeah, in my experience anyway, it works really well as a kind of springboard or brainstorming

17:17.060 --> 17:20.220
partner, less well as a source of accurate information.

17:20.220 --> 17:21.220
Yeah.

17:21.220 --> 17:24.900
Ironically, the computer program is better at creative thought than accurate information,

17:24.900 --> 17:30.500
which is fine, except, you know, Microsoft put it into being a search engine, a thing

17:30.500 --> 17:32.980
people use to find accurate information.

17:32.980 --> 17:37.220
And this is a problem as bombastic as the prognostications around AI have been to me

17:37.220 --> 17:38.660
anyway.

17:38.660 --> 17:42.980
This is a much more immediate threat the way AI could accelerate the already massive problem

17:42.980 --> 17:43.980
misinformation online.

17:43.980 --> 17:47.700
You know, I keep hearing about people using this as a shortcut to creating content online,

17:47.700 --> 17:48.700
which is fine.

17:48.700 --> 17:52.180
Like I just said, there's some really helpful use cases for that, but you have to fact check

17:52.180 --> 17:53.180
it.

17:53.180 --> 17:55.940
And frankly, a lot of people aren't going to do that because for many people, whether

17:55.940 --> 17:57.420
or not it's accurate, it doesn't matter.

17:57.420 --> 17:59.580
It's just about giving people something to click on.

17:59.580 --> 18:02.700
Combine this with the rapid advancement of the image generating apps that are already

18:02.700 --> 18:07.180
damn near photorealistic and we are truly entering a post-truth age when literally any

18:07.180 --> 18:11.660
content can be faked, any image can be faked, any voice can be faked, I haven't even gotten

18:11.660 --> 18:12.660
to that one yet.

18:13.020 --> 18:15.780
And pretty soon, nobody's going to know what to believe anymore.

18:15.780 --> 18:18.740
So they'll just believe whatever they want to believe.

18:18.740 --> 18:22.940
Only increasing the fragmentation and distrust in our society, which is pretty god-awful

18:22.940 --> 18:23.940
already.

18:23.940 --> 18:27.740
Now the AI bros are quick to point out that this is the worst AI will ever be.

18:27.740 --> 18:29.900
That it'll only get better from here.

18:29.900 --> 18:34.100
But on the other hand, it'll only get better from here.

18:34.100 --> 18:38.700
Now there are other LLMs being developed like Lambda from Meta and Bard from Google that

18:38.700 --> 18:40.180
have not been released to the public.

18:40.180 --> 18:44.140
People especially being extremely cautious about releasing Bard because, you know, their

18:44.140 --> 18:46.740
entire reputation is based on their accuracy.

18:46.740 --> 18:50.940
Some will say that Microsoft was actually being really risky putting chat GBT into Bing

18:50.940 --> 18:54.900
so early, but let's be honest, nobody was using Bing so they really had nothing to lose.

18:54.900 --> 18:58.740
But this does put pressure on Google to counter with their own search assistant and now we've

18:58.740 --> 19:00.300
got an AI arms race.

19:00.300 --> 19:03.620
But I guess, you know, maybe the upside is that there's only a handful of these LLMs

19:03.620 --> 19:06.980
right now because they take literally billions of dollars to train them.

19:07.980 --> 19:10.300
Only that's not true anymore.

19:10.300 --> 19:14.260
Late last year researchers at Stanford announced a powerful LLM called Alpaca that could be

19:14.260 --> 19:17.740
pre-trained for as little as $600.

19:17.740 --> 19:21.540
They did it to create an LLM that academic institutions can test without, you know, needing

19:21.540 --> 19:23.300
billions of dollars of funding.

19:23.300 --> 19:26.260
According to their paper, it worked about as well as Meta's Lambda AI model.

19:26.260 --> 19:27.380
It didn't stay up long though.

19:27.380 --> 19:31.580
They took it down on March 20th because they were concerned about hallucinations.

19:31.580 --> 19:34.340
That's what they call it when computers tell confident lies.

19:34.340 --> 19:36.540
You know, like chat GBT does about half the time.

19:36.540 --> 19:37.940
But the point had been made.

19:37.940 --> 19:41.500
The price of LLMs is going down from billions of dollars to hundreds of dollars and pretty

19:41.500 --> 19:43.860
soon people will be making these in their garages.

19:43.860 --> 19:48.180
And since GPT-4, which hasn't been fully released to the public just yet, it has the ability

19:48.180 --> 19:49.980
to write code.

19:49.980 --> 19:53.540
So now you have the ability for AI to write more AI and improve it.

19:53.540 --> 19:56.700
Anybody else feeling like this is kind of spiraling out of control?

19:56.700 --> 20:00.060
It's no wonder that over a thousand tech insiders signed a letter in March to put a pause on

20:00.060 --> 20:02.180
AI development beyond GPT-4.

20:02.180 --> 20:06.420
That's from the Future of Life Institute, which is controversial in its own way.

20:06.420 --> 20:09.020
And there's a heated debate around their intentions, which is a rabbit hole.

20:09.020 --> 20:11.460
I'm just going to have to leave out of this video.

20:11.460 --> 20:14.820
But even with the generative AI that's out right now, we've seen a flurry of app creation

20:14.820 --> 20:15.820
using it.

20:15.820 --> 20:19.580
Literally every other day, there's a new crazy world-changing app that makes the news.

20:19.580 --> 20:23.260
Some of it's been the same AI marketing I was talking about before that's nothing new.

20:23.260 --> 20:25.420
But some of it's just bonkers.

20:25.420 --> 20:30.060
Things like mixo.io that create websites in minutes, jasper.ai that writes marketing

20:30.060 --> 20:32.060
and SEO copy for the web.

20:32.140 --> 20:34.860
luca.com that creates AI-generated logos.

20:34.860 --> 20:39.140
tome.app that writes and creates presentations with Dolly and chat GPT.

20:39.140 --> 20:43.940
quillbot.com that paraphrases AI paragraphs so it can pass an AI detector.

20:43.940 --> 20:45.340
Yikes.

20:45.340 --> 20:48.740
There's runway.ml, it's a video editor and image processor.

20:48.740 --> 20:52.020
NVIDIA has an app that lets you draw a simple landscape and it'll just fill in the rest

20:52.020 --> 20:53.340
they call that Canva.

20:53.340 --> 20:57.420
NVIDIA also has a broadcasting app that will basically make your eyes look like it's going

20:57.420 --> 20:58.980
in the direction of the camera.

20:58.980 --> 21:04.220
There's 11labs.io that does voice cloning, sounddraw.io that makes music.

21:04.220 --> 21:07.700
There's agent GPT that lets you build an AI agent that can do anything you can ask it

21:07.700 --> 21:08.700
to do.

21:08.700 --> 21:13.020
And there's futuretools.io which is an AI search engine for AI tools.

21:13.020 --> 21:15.460
By the way, that's just a sample.

21:15.460 --> 21:19.140
There are hundreds of these out there and there are other channels that have reviewed

21:19.140 --> 21:21.060
literally hundreds of these apps.

21:21.060 --> 21:24.100
Again, I'll just point you to those, there's gonna be a link downstairs.

21:24.100 --> 21:28.940
Okay, so when it comes to these new AI tools, my personal theory is that they're just that.

21:28.940 --> 21:30.300
They're tools, you know.

21:30.300 --> 21:33.300
You still need to know what you're doing to get the kind of results that people are talking

21:33.300 --> 21:34.300
about here.

21:34.300 --> 21:35.300
You know, it's like Photoshop.

21:35.300 --> 21:38.460
Just because you have Photoshop doesn't mean that you can do the same thing as a professional

21:38.460 --> 21:39.580
designer can do.

21:39.580 --> 21:40.660
I can attest to this.

21:40.660 --> 21:41.860
I suck at Photoshop.

21:41.860 --> 21:45.540
Actually, there's a great meme that's going around that anybody who's worked in a creative

21:45.540 --> 21:46.540
field will understand.

21:46.540 --> 21:50.700
It says, to replace creatives with AI, clients will need to be able to accurately describe

21:50.700 --> 21:52.780
what they're looking for.

21:52.780 --> 21:53.780
We're safe.

21:53.780 --> 21:54.780
I'm sorry.

21:54.780 --> 21:57.340
As somebody who's worked in that field, I can tell you that made me laugh quite a bit

21:57.340 --> 21:58.340
when I first saw it.

21:58.380 --> 22:03.300
But anyway, to test my theory, I actually dug in to about 10 or so of these apps, and I made

22:03.300 --> 22:07.500
a whole separate video of it where I go through some of these apps, and I try to figure out

22:07.500 --> 22:12.340
if I can make them work as a total noob in the way that the demos of these apps say they

22:12.340 --> 22:13.340
can.

22:13.340 --> 22:16.700
And I'm uploading this along with this video to Nebula, because I've just seen a ton of

22:16.700 --> 22:19.540
these videos talking about these crazy things that these apps can do, but I've never actually

22:19.540 --> 22:23.620
seen anybody actually use them, again, outside of those product demos.

22:23.620 --> 22:25.540
So yeah, I gave it a try myself.

22:25.540 --> 22:30.380
Some were garbage, but some I really think I might be using from now on, and trust me,

22:30.380 --> 22:33.980
if a tech adult like me can do cool things with them, then they must be pretty powerful.

22:33.980 --> 22:36.540
So if you're on Nebula, you can watch it right after this video.

22:36.540 --> 22:40.420
If you're not on Nebula, well, here's why you should sign up for it.

22:40.420 --> 22:43.360
Nebula is the premium streaming service that I help start along with some of my friends

22:43.360 --> 22:47.860
who just happen to be some of the best educational YouTubers in the world, and I am completely

22:47.860 --> 22:49.500
unbiased in that statement.

22:49.500 --> 22:52.940
On Nebula, you can watch our videos ad-free and earlier than everywhere else, and you

22:52.940 --> 22:56.580
can also see Nebula-exclusive videos that you can't find anywhere else, including Real

22:56.580 --> 23:01.100
Engineering's Logistics of D-Day series, Real Science's unbelievably good series

23:01.100 --> 23:05.020
called Becoming Human, and for those with a more big curiosity, you can find my Mysteries

23:05.020 --> 23:08.140
of the Human Body series and my ongoing Forgotten atrocity series.

23:08.140 --> 23:11.820
And something I don't talk about nearly enough is Nebula classes.

23:11.820 --> 23:15.220
This is like some of those other online learning platforms that you may have heard of, but

23:15.220 --> 23:19.820
these classes are run by educational YouTubers, just going full on educational.

23:19.820 --> 23:23.020
You can learn how to produce videos like Volksgeist, how to produce music like Adam

23:23.020 --> 23:27.500
Neely, and how to sue like a lawyer with LegalEagle, and there's new ones added all the time.

23:27.500 --> 23:32.980
And the reason why we made this platform is because YouTube can be a lot.

23:32.980 --> 23:37.040
With the ever-changing algorithm, the AI once again, we're always chasing the content

23:37.040 --> 23:40.140
that will work here, and we're always having to be more click-bitty and sensational.

23:40.140 --> 23:43.740
I know you guys hate that, but Nebula is a place where we can just let our hair down

23:43.740 --> 23:45.340
and make the content that we care about.

23:45.340 --> 23:48.740
So if you've ever thought about supporting a YouTuber, this is easily the biggest bang

23:48.740 --> 23:49.740
for your buck.

23:49.740 --> 23:53.180
Because not only are you supporting hundreds of content creators with that one subscription,

23:53.180 --> 23:54.900
you get tons of content in return.

23:54.900 --> 23:58.620
And if you sign up for the link below, you get that for 40% off the annual plan, which

23:58.620 --> 24:01.260
comes out to a little bit over 250 a month.

24:01.260 --> 24:03.980
Which is probably worth it just so you don't have to hear ad reads like this.

24:03.980 --> 24:06.620
So click the link down in the description below to check it out and watch me test out

24:06.620 --> 24:10.500
some of these AI apps, which I can tell you, if you were to test all these apps out yourself,

24:10.500 --> 24:13.500
it would cost way more than your Nebula subscription.

24:13.500 --> 24:15.220
So boom, you've already saved money.

24:15.220 --> 24:18.660
All right, so to kind of wrap this thing up, I want to kind of talk about some of the issues

24:18.660 --> 24:22.700
that really need to be mentioned, because so much of this topic gets overwhelmed by

24:22.700 --> 24:24.860
the existential dread stuff.

24:24.860 --> 24:29.140
And while I know that's kind of my thing, there are some right here right now problems

24:29.140 --> 24:30.820
that are far more immediate threats.

24:30.820 --> 24:35.060
Obviously, there's issues of jobs being lost to AI, and yeah, this is something to be concerned

24:35.060 --> 24:36.060
about.

24:36.060 --> 24:39.420
But there's also a bit of a debate around this, because one could also make the argument

24:39.420 --> 24:42.740
that these new tools could help employees be more productive and more creative.

24:42.740 --> 24:46.340
Yeah, there's another line that tech bros tend to say, which is your job isn't going

24:46.340 --> 24:50.380
to be replaced by AI, it's going to be replaced by somebody else using AI.

24:50.380 --> 24:53.220
And there's a couple of things that I can point to as perfect examples of that.

24:53.220 --> 24:59.380
So Corridor crew did this all AI animation called Rock, Paper, Scissors, which is incredible.

24:59.380 --> 25:03.860
And also a TikTok creator called Ghostwriter977 made a lot of news recently because he made

25:03.860 --> 25:10.540
a song called Heart on My Sleeve that used Drake's voice in the song, but it was AI-generated.

25:10.540 --> 25:13.580
And it was so good that it got taken down by Drake's people.

25:13.580 --> 25:17.380
And the point there is that, yeah, these guys were able to do amazing things, but these

25:17.380 --> 25:19.420
are extremely talented people.

25:19.420 --> 25:23.740
I mean, you can look at Corridor crew's YouTube page, I mean, they make insane stuff all the

25:23.740 --> 25:24.740
time.

25:24.740 --> 25:26.460
This is just a new tool they've been able to use.

25:26.460 --> 25:29.820
I mean, going back to Photoshop, when it came out, I remember a lot of people were worried

25:29.820 --> 25:34.140
that it was going to put photographers and illustrators out of business, but most professionals

25:34.140 --> 25:37.860
just kind of adapted to it and just started using it and made better stuff than they'd

25:37.860 --> 25:39.380
ever made before in their lives.

25:39.380 --> 25:43.740
I personally do know a few artists that are actually embracing Dolly in mid-journey.

25:43.740 --> 25:46.100
Mostly it's just kind of jumping off points to kind of spark new ideas.

25:46.100 --> 25:49.700
And as a writer, as I showed a minute ago with some of the brainstorming ideas, like

25:49.700 --> 25:52.580
this is a really quick and easy way to push through writer's blog.

25:52.580 --> 25:57.380
I do worry a bit that this could kind of become an Uroboros, like a snake eating its own tail

25:57.380 --> 26:01.900
because if people use these AIs to create online content and then the AI pulls from

26:01.900 --> 26:06.700
that online content to make new content, it just becomes an endless cycle.

26:06.700 --> 26:10.260
There is also the whole debate around the fact that AI is using other people's work

26:10.260 --> 26:14.820
as part of that large language model and stuff, all of which is copyrighted material

26:14.820 --> 26:18.260
and a lot of people are up in arms about that, and I think understandably so.

26:18.260 --> 26:24.020
But also at the same time, again, playing devil's advocate, it's not completely copying

26:24.020 --> 26:25.020
it.

26:25.020 --> 26:28.060
It's kind of using it as an inspiration, which we all do that, don't we?

26:28.060 --> 26:33.500
It's like it also just made the news recently that Ed Sheeran had been sued for possibly

26:33.500 --> 26:39.220
copying the court progression from the song Let's Get It On, but a lot of pop songs use

26:39.220 --> 26:40.220
the same court progressions.

26:40.220 --> 26:44.020
In fact, there were songs before Let's Get It On that used that same court progression,

26:44.020 --> 26:46.300
which is why Ed Sheeran won his lawsuit.

26:46.300 --> 26:49.860
So this is an ongoing debate around art that started long before AI.

26:49.860 --> 26:54.220
It'll be going on long after, but AI does make it a bit more complicated.

26:54.220 --> 26:59.700
Now the pessimist in me does worry that the money people see AI as a cheap or even free

26:59.700 --> 27:03.860
content creator, and that it'll squeeze creative jobs out of existence.

27:03.860 --> 27:08.300
But the optimist in me thinks that humans working with AI could unleash even more mind

27:08.300 --> 27:12.660
bending ideas and that eventually the cream will rise to the top, just like all the tools

27:12.660 --> 27:13.660
from the past did.

27:13.660 --> 27:17.380
Now in fact, as I'm recording this, we'll see if this is still going on when the video

27:17.380 --> 27:21.340
comes out, the WGA is striking in Hollywood.

27:21.340 --> 27:24.740
Part of that is about streaming services and not getting paid well for the streaming services,

27:24.740 --> 27:28.580
but a big part of the argument, a big part of why they're striking right now has to

27:28.580 --> 27:29.580
do with AI.

27:29.580 --> 27:33.980
And I want to just point out a thread that Justine Bateman shared on Twitter, where

27:33.980 --> 27:37.140
she was talking about some of the big issues and things that we can expect to be happening

27:37.140 --> 27:41.940
in the near future with AI for some of the things that they're trying to get ahead of.

27:41.940 --> 27:45.260
She starts by pointing out that she is actually a coder and she has a computer science degree,

27:45.260 --> 27:47.260
so she does know a bit of what she's talking about here.

27:47.260 --> 27:51.140
She points out that AI written scripts and digitally scanned actors already exist.

27:51.140 --> 27:55.580
And actually Bruce Willis made news for signing over his AI rights to his likeness.

27:55.580 --> 27:59.780
This kind of started happening when he came when he was diagnosed with aphasia and couldn't

27:59.780 --> 28:00.900
really perform anymore.

28:00.900 --> 28:05.540
He sold his AI rights so that people could continue to make movies with him in the distant

28:05.540 --> 28:06.540
future.

28:06.540 --> 28:09.700
She points out that in that case, your digital image can be triple and quadruple booked,

28:09.700 --> 28:13.580
so an actor could actually be working multiple projects at the same time.

28:13.580 --> 28:17.620
She suggested in the future that films could be customized for the viewer, meaning people

28:17.620 --> 28:21.460
could just special order a movie if they wanted to.

28:21.460 --> 28:25.100
She uses the example of, I want to film about a panda in a unicorn who saved the world in

28:25.100 --> 28:28.700
a rocket ship and put Bill Murray in it, so you could be watching whatever streaming service

28:28.700 --> 28:32.300
they might offer something where you could just give a text prompt and it will just create

28:32.300 --> 28:35.380
a movie as you wanted to see it.

28:35.380 --> 28:39.740
Which Bill Murray with a panda in a unicorn saving the world in a rocket ship just sounds

28:39.740 --> 28:42.140
like a Wes Anderson movie.

28:42.140 --> 28:45.900
Which actually I'm pretty sure that Wes Anderson at this point is just an AI that's been pre-trained

28:45.900 --> 28:47.780
on Wes Anderson movies.

28:47.780 --> 28:51.620
She points out the possibility of people getting themselves scanned and putting themselves

28:51.620 --> 28:54.820
into films so like you could put your own face on Darth Vader.

28:54.820 --> 28:58.580
She said you could train an AI program on a series and then just create a whole new

28:58.580 --> 29:00.460
season of that series.

29:00.460 --> 29:05.660
And that brings up some really interesting possibilities but my big question is, is that

29:05.660 --> 29:06.660
something people want?

29:06.660 --> 29:09.700
I mean, would you want to see that?

29:09.700 --> 29:13.900
Like there are already programs like Nothing Forever, which is a never ending AI generated

29:13.900 --> 29:16.020
Seinfeld episode.

29:16.020 --> 29:23.140
I mean, who isn't crazy these days?

29:23.140 --> 29:26.700
This is terrible, but it will get better.

29:26.700 --> 29:31.020
And actually the Nothing Forever thing, it's streaming on Twitch, they took it down because

29:31.020 --> 29:34.900
it started using homophobic slurs.

29:34.900 --> 29:35.900
So there's that.

29:35.900 --> 29:40.500
Yeah, you know, computers doing all the creative stuff while people keep working in factories

29:40.500 --> 29:44.020
for lower and lower paying jobs is not the future I was hoping for.

29:44.020 --> 29:48.700
Now as for administrative and legal jobs and whatnot that's under threat by AI, that

29:48.700 --> 29:50.300
I don't think is anything new.

29:50.300 --> 29:52.460
I don't mean to minimize that as a threat.

29:52.460 --> 29:56.220
It definitely is to a lot of people, but that's a trend that's been going on for quite some

29:56.220 --> 29:57.220
time now.

29:57.220 --> 30:00.460
And again, I think the more familiar you are with these tools, the safer your job's going

30:00.460 --> 30:03.420
to be, but there are a lot of takes on that subject.

30:03.420 --> 30:08.580
Now one area of AI that did put me on my heels is that of AI and warfare.

30:08.580 --> 30:12.580
I talked a little bit about AI in my episode on the future of war, but that's a debate

30:12.580 --> 30:14.380
that's only getting bigger and more confusing.

30:14.380 --> 30:18.540
AI gets used in a lot of ways by the military from image processing to logistics, but what

30:18.540 --> 30:23.060
about AI's having the power to decide if a person lives or dies?

30:23.060 --> 30:26.780
Like just the fact that, you know, drones were conducting strikes controlled by an operator

30:26.780 --> 30:30.580
hundreds of miles away, like that was iffy at the time when that started being a thing.

30:30.580 --> 30:34.540
But now the debate is whether or not an AI should be allowed to make that decision.

30:34.540 --> 30:38.700
But even bigger than that, way bigger than that, is that increasingly there's been talk

30:38.700 --> 30:41.100
about giving AI the ability to launch nuclear weapons.

30:41.100 --> 30:45.060
I think I need a lighting change.

30:45.060 --> 30:49.060
So back in the 80s, the Soviets instituted a dead hand mechanism on their nuclear arsenal.

30:49.060 --> 30:52.620
This was in the event that, you know, decision makers might get wiped out in a nuclear strike

30:52.620 --> 30:56.340
on Moscow, it would automatically trigger all their nukes to fire at the U.S.

30:56.340 --> 31:00.420
Now you could say this was kind of an early algorithm or automation of the nuclear arsenal.

31:00.420 --> 31:04.180
And similarly, the U.S. has contingencies in place in the event of a first strike scenario,

31:04.740 --> 31:08.780
but that time horizon on first strike has gotten smaller and smaller over the years.

31:08.780 --> 31:11.380
First ICBMs could reach the U.S. in about 30 minutes.

31:11.380 --> 31:13.820
The nuclear submarines cut that time in half.

31:13.820 --> 31:17.460
Today we're seeing the birth of hypersonic missiles that could cut that in half yet again.

31:17.460 --> 31:21.820
So now in a nuclear scenario, military leaders may have less than seven minutes to make a

31:21.820 --> 31:24.060
decision and retaliate.

31:24.060 --> 31:28.100
And that's led many to consider handing those decisions over to AI to save precious seconds.

31:28.100 --> 31:33.500
So when we talk about an AI arms race, this is the ultimate version of that.

31:33.500 --> 31:38.580
We could see a day in the very near future where the U.S., China, and Russia all had their

31:38.580 --> 31:40.380
nuclear arsenals controlled by AI.

31:40.380 --> 31:48.060
AI that we don't fully understand or control with the ability to wipe out all life on Earth.

31:48.060 --> 31:51.860
Anyway, just something to think about.

31:51.860 --> 31:56.820
Ultimately, I think what we're dealing with here really is just an amplifier.

31:56.820 --> 32:00.220
It's a highly evolving set of tools that can make production more productive, create

32:00.220 --> 32:05.420
as more creative, bad actors and the worst actors, scammers more successful, and weapons

32:05.420 --> 32:06.420
more deadly.

32:06.420 --> 32:10.620
It's the Wild West right now, and we really don't know where this goes.

32:10.620 --> 32:13.820
And I can hear all the comments already of people saying, you forgot about this, you forgot

32:13.820 --> 32:14.820
about that.

32:14.820 --> 32:18.340
Yeah, there's a lot that I left out of this video because it's just too much.

32:18.340 --> 32:23.700
This is already way too long of a video, and writing this kind of broke my brain.

32:23.700 --> 32:27.500
The whole thing just gives me like a grandma migraine headache.

32:27.500 --> 32:32.060
Like not here or here so much, but like right here.

32:32.060 --> 32:35.620
So any one of the topics that I brought up here and any of the things that I left out

32:35.620 --> 32:38.820
for that matter could be entire videos of their own.

32:38.820 --> 32:42.700
So yeah, if this video does well and you guys want to see a video on any of those topics,

32:42.700 --> 32:43.700
let me know.

32:43.700 --> 32:44.700
Maybe I'll do them.

32:44.700 --> 32:47.380
And also, there's a ton of videos and creators doing great work on this topic.

32:47.380 --> 32:50.380
Again, I'm going to put links down in the description so you guys can go check it out.

32:50.380 --> 32:54.620
I encourage you to do so because we got to stay on top of this.

32:54.620 --> 32:55.620
The genie's out of the bottle.

32:55.980 --> 32:59.820
But I think I'll leave things off with a quote from Jeffrey Hinton, who's often called

32:59.820 --> 33:00.820
the godfather of AI.

33:00.820 --> 33:03.860
He's been working on AI in neural nets since the 80s.

33:03.860 --> 33:05.660
And he was working with Google until recently.

33:05.660 --> 33:09.980
He actually, he left Google so that he could speak freely about this subject.

33:09.980 --> 33:12.380
He recently said this in an interview with CBS.

33:12.380 --> 33:17.980
This is the biggest technological advancement since, is this another industrial revolution?

33:17.980 --> 33:18.980
What is this?

33:18.980 --> 33:20.300
How should people think of it?

33:20.300 --> 33:24.860
I think it's comparable in scale with the industrial revolution or electricity.

33:25.580 --> 33:27.580
Or maybe the wheel.

33:27.580 --> 33:29.580
Or maybe the wheel.

33:29.580 --> 33:30.580
Yeah.

33:30.580 --> 33:32.580
That was earlier.

33:32.580 --> 33:33.580
Yeah.

33:33.580 --> 33:34.580
Okay.

33:34.580 --> 33:35.580
So buckle up.

33:35.580 --> 33:36.580
Yeah.

33:36.580 --> 33:37.580
All right.

33:37.580 --> 33:38.580
Thanks a lot for watching.

33:38.580 --> 33:40.660
Go check out that other video over on Nebula if you want to get your brain melted just

33:40.660 --> 33:41.660
a little bit yourself.

33:41.660 --> 33:45.980
But I want to take a minute to quickly thank all the Patreon supporters and answer files

33:45.980 --> 33:47.980

33:47.980 --> 33:48.980

It's such a big topic.

34:19.540 --> 34:21.620
And again, there's so much that I left out of this.

Google thinks you might like that one because they've been watching AI and all that.

You can look down on the sidebar if you're watching on your browser, any of the thumbnails

34:41.380 --> 34:42.380
I am putting this video to bed.

34:42.380 --> 34:43.380
Thank God.

34:43.380 --> 34:45.180
Thank you guys for watching.

34:45.180 --> 34:47.220
