0	7200	Hi, I have a confession to make, I absolutely love complex numbers.
7200	12720	They are one of the most amazing ideas in all of mathematics.
12720	18080	What I despise is mystic and darkness surrounding them.
18080	20480	Look at these silly jokes.
20480	27560	Non-Math people think that mathematicians are crazy and jokes like these only reinforce
27560	28860	that.
28860	35260	It makes me sad, since mathematics is full of the most amazing ideas.
35260	39460	Unfortunately, they remain hidden.
39460	44460	Jokes aside, Veritasil made this video about complex numbers.
44460	50580	While it beautifully explains the history, it also contains some weird statements like
50580	52780	this one.
52780	59260	Only by abandoning math's connection to reality could we discover reality's true nature.
59260	61180	What a nonsense.
61180	65420	I will show you that complex numbers are completely natural.
65420	69820	Moreover, this is known for over 200 years.
69820	75820	The point here is not to trash their ex-work, as I am a huge fan of Veritasium.
75820	82860	It just highlights the amount of confusion and darkness surrounding complex numbers.
82860	89500	We weigh so much potential of countless people by teaching complex numbers as these mysterious
89500	91820	imaginary entities.
91820	95140	This has to stop.
95140	99980	The goal of this video is to demystify complex numbers.
99980	106460	I will fully explain that they describe geometric transformations of the plane.
106460	112380	And we will show that the only source of confusion about square roots of negative numbers is
112380	116620	our bad terminology and notation.
116620	120340	We start with a little bit of historical context.
120340	125780	In high school, I was told that complex numbers were invented to add solutions to the quadratic
125780	129820	formula when real ones do not exist.
129820	137300	This doesn't make any sense, since the well-known graph of parabola does not intersect the x-axis.
137300	140060	So there are no solutions.
140060	145900	Complex numbers were actually discovered while studying cubic polynomials, which always intersect
145900	149260	the x-axis.
149260	155860	The general solution of the cubic equation was first described by Cardano in 1545 in his
155860	158420	book Artis Magna.
158420	163380	In one formula, square roots of negative numbers were encountered.
163380	169100	But they did cancel out in the end and produced a correct real solution.
169100	175900	Cardano himself commented this case by saying s subtl as it is useless.
175900	178460	But it caught the attention of Bombelli.
178460	183860	In his two books on algebra, he performed the first substantial calculations with complex
183860	184860	numbers.
185660	192700	He called the square root of minus 1 nowadays denoted i as the plus of minus.
192700	195820	This is everything I want to say about these equations.
195820	200500	If you want to know more, I recommend the excellent history description in the Veritasium
200500	201500	video.
201500	206540	There is also a discussion with Ribou Van Braun, which explains mathematics behind
206540	209380	cubic and quadratic formulas.
209380	216420	These two videos by Matemaniac and not all wrong show why there is no Quintic formula.
216420	220140	If you want to explore all these extra materials, don't worry.
220140	226380	This presentation is built in the online application ORPAD, of which I am one of the creators.
226380	231300	You can find a link to this presentation in the video description.
231300	233940	Let's go back to complex numbers.
233940	239060	Even after 100 years, they were still viewed with suspicion and disbelief.
239060	244660	The cart associated imaginary numbers with geometric impossibility.
244660	250900	He coined the term imaginary, basically stating that one can invent solutions of an equation,
250900	257380	but it does not mean that these imaginary quantities have any real meaning.
257380	262860	Even the magician Euler called complex numbers impossible while proving many substantial
262860	264380	results.
264380	270820	He also introduced the notation I for the square root of minus 1.
270820	277100	Shortly after, Wessel and Argan first described geometry of complex numbers, but their work
277100	278660	was not widely known.
278660	285460	Only when the prominent mathematician Gauss described this geometry in 1831, people took
285460	286460	notice.
286460	292820	While working on this video, I discovered a great boat by Gauss that accurately reflects
292820	299460	my approach to explaining complex numbers.
299460	304460	If this subject has either to been considered from the wrong viewpoint and thus enveloped
304460	309900	in mystery and surrounded by darkness, it is largely an unsuitable terminology which
309900	311700	should be blamed.
311700	319260	Had plus 1, minus 1 and square root of minus 1, instead of being called positive, negative
319260	327180	and imaginary or worse still impossible unity, being given the name say of direct, inverse
327180	333420	and lateral unity, there would hardly have been any scope for such obscurity.
333420	337940	Wow, I love this so much.
337940	343220	Mathematicians notice Gauss' work, fix their misunderstandings and all mystery of complex
343220	344980	numbers is gone.
344980	348300	Sadly, that's not the case.
348300	354020	The amount of mystic and darkness has only grown.
354020	359220	Traveling back in time to Descartes and Euler, it makes sense that imaginary numbers raised
359220	361700	eyebrows and doubts.
361700	368220	But thanks to Gauss' brilliant insights, we can no longer use ignorance as an excuse.
368220	375860	Yet, even after 200 years, the Gauss' work is still misunderstood and he is furious about
375860	376860	that.
376860	379060	Let's fix it in this video.
379060	385740	With the great power of the internet, you can help by watching, liking and adding some
385740	392220	comments so we can together be the almighty YouTube algorithm.
392220	398500	Please share this video with your family and friends, educate your grandma and explain it
398500	402500	even to your dog.
402500	408220	Let's sidestep the complex numbers for a second and talk about plane geometry.
408220	413540	If you are familiar with vectors, matrices and their geometric meaning, feel free to
413540	416780	skip to the next chapter.
416780	423260	All points of the plane, also called vectors, can be described as pairs of numbers representing
423260	427860	the coordinates on the x and y axis.
427860	434500	Vectors can be added by summing their coordinates, corresponding to adding forces in physics.
434500	440820	And vectors can be scaled by an arbitrary number alpha, making the resulting vector longer
440820	442740	or shorter.
442740	448500	If alpha is negative, the direction of the vector is sweet.
448500	452180	We can apply geometric transformations of the plane.
452180	458220	You are probably familiar with these from computer graphic editors.
458220	464420	The entire plane can be scaled by some factor, which scales all the vectors.
464420	470500	We can also rotate all the vectors around the origin by some angle, and the plane can
470500	476220	be reflected along some line x axis in this example.
476220	480060	All these transformations have one thing in common.
480060	485300	Their pictures display two vectors u and v, and their sum u plus v.
485300	492020	Notice that it doesn't matter whether we first add them and then transform the result,
492020	496900	or whether we add u and v already transformed.
496900	500820	In both situations, we get the same result.
500820	507260	In other words, this equality is always satisfied.
507260	514220	Transforms of the plane which satisfy this equality and also a similar equality for scaling
514220	516340	are called linear.
516340	520580	All previously shown transformations are linear.
520580	526340	By using alpha equals zero, it easily follows that every linear transformation preserves
526340	528140	the origin.
528140	534060	So a notable nonlinear transformation is the translation of the plane by some vector,
534060	539100	which means adding this vector to all vectors in the plane.
539100	543180	Suppose that we have some linear transformation f.
543180	549100	What is the least amount of information we need to know to fully describe it?
549100	553100	It turns out that not that much is needed.
553100	562660	Notice that any vector xy can be expressed as the sum of x times 1 0 with y times 0 1.
562660	570340	By linearity, it follows that the image of xy is fully determined by the images of 1 0
570340	572300	and 0 1.
572300	579740	We know that the image of 1 0 is some vector a b and the image of 0 1 is some other vector
579740	581540	c d.
581540	591140	In total, f is fully described by four numbers a b c d, which are placed in a 2 by 2 table.
591140	597620	The first column represents the image of 1 0, while the second column represents the
597620	599900	image of 0 1.
599900	602940	This table is called a matrix.
602940	609460	Let's see some examples, which will be important later when we describe geometry of complex
609460	611140	numbers.
611140	617060	When every vector of the plane is scaled by some factor r, the vector 1 0 is mapped to
617060	621780	r 0 and 0 1 is mapped to 0 r.
621780	629320	So the resulting matrix is the diagonal matrix with r on the diagonal.
629320	635860	For the 90 degree rotation, the vector 1 0 is mapped to the other vector 0 1, while
635860	640380	0 1 is mapped to minus 1 0.
640380	649340	So the resulting matrix has 0 on the diagonal and plus 1 and minus 1 of the diagonal.
649340	654940	The matrix of an arbitrary rotation is a little bit more involved.
654940	663900	From geometry, 1 0 is rotated to the coordinates cosine phi and sine phi, which are the coordinates
663900	668500	of the point on the unit circle with the angle phi.
668500	675020	The other vector 0 1 is rotated by further 90 degrees to the point, which after some
675020	680600	simplifications has the coordinates minus sine phi and cosine phi.
680600	687140	So the resulting matrix has cosine phi on the diagonal and sine phi and minus sine phi
687140	689140	of the diagonal.
689140	696500	Okay, we know that each linear transformation is represented by some 2 by 2 matrix.
696500	697500	So what?
697500	700460	Who is this information useful?
700460	706380	It would be great to use this matrix to describe the image of an input vector x y.
706380	714260	Recall that the image of x y is a combination of the images of 1 0 and 0 1, which are described
714260	717260	by the columns of the matrix.
717260	722740	So we can just scale the first column by x and scale the second one by y and sum them
722740	724500	together.
724500	729220	This is precisely how matrix vector multiplication works.
729220	735820	So to find the image of x y, we just need to multiply it by the matrix.
735820	739620	Let's apply this knowledge on the 90 degree rotation.
739620	745700	We already know the rotation matrix, so by multiplying x y with it, we get the vector
745700	747860	minus y x.
747860	751660	This is a neat trick I already discovered at high school.
751660	757180	To rotate a plane vector by 90 degrees, we just need to swap the coordinates and switch
757180	759660	the sign of one of them.
759660	764140	This nicely explains the matrix of an arbitrary rotation.
764140	769540	The image of the blue vector is obtained by rotating the image of the red vector by 90
769540	770540	degrees.
770540	778940	The coordinates of cosine phi, sine phi are swapped and the sine of sine phi is switched.
778940	781540	Linear transformations can be chained.
781540	787220	We first map the plane by a linear transformation F and then map the images by another linear
787220	793500	transformation G. The resulting composite transformation is again linear.
793500	800820	It turns out that it is represented by the matrix multiplication B times A.
800820	808380	For example, when we apply the 90 degree rotation twice, it becomes the 180 degree rotation.
808380	812940	We already know the matrix A of the 90 degree rotation.
812940	821500	The matrix of the 180 degree rotation is obtained by multiplying A with A, which is A squared.
821500	827820	Since the 180 degree rotation flips each vector, it is correctly represented by the matrix
827820	830260	A squared.
830260	836460	In summary, we have seen that points of the plane are represented by two coordinate vectors
836580	841700	while their transformations are described with two by two matrices.
841700	849100	Whenever you see a matrix, geometric it corresponds to some linear transformation.
849100	855420	I believe the concept of linear transformations and their matrix representation is the single
855420	860020	most important idea in all of mathematics.
860020	866580	For instance, the derivative of a function satisfies these equalities, so it is a linear
866580	868900	transformation.
868900	874580	If you want to learn more about linear transformations, I recommend this excellent book by Gilbert
874580	876300	Strang.
876300	882420	You can also check out a free Boolean Brown video that uses animation to explain linear
882420	884900	transformations.
884900	889980	I taught linear algebra for several years and have written a few books in check about
889980	890980	it.
890980	897900	Needless to say, it is one of my favorite topics in mathematics.
897900	904260	With the built geometric understanding, we are finally ready to tackle complex numbers.
904260	908340	They actually have two different geometric meanings.
908340	913700	The first meaning states that the complex number A plus B i corresponds to the vector
913700	920780	A B. The fact that all complex numbers form the two-dimensional plane is well known and
920780	924660	it is often called gauss-complex plane.
924660	931220	There is some evidence that this was already known to Euler.
931220	934940	The other geometric meaning is much less known.
934940	942060	The complex number A plus B i corresponds to the 2 by 2 matrix with A on the diagonal
942060	945900	and B and minus B off the diagonal.
945900	952380	At this moment, it is not clear why one should place A and B into a matrix like this, so
952380	954420	consider it a lucky guess.
954420	962260	We will show that it reveals geometry of complex numbers hidden for centuries.
962260	968440	To see that these representations are valid, we have to prove that addition and multiplication
968440	974500	works for them in the same way as for A plus B i.
974500	980300	Complex numbers are added by independently summing the real and imaginary parts.
980300	987580	Similarly, vectors and matrices are added by independently summing their coordinates.
987580	993660	So we get the same complex number having the real part A plus C and the imaginary part
993660	1001060	B plus D. Complex numbers are multiplied by multiplying the parentheses where i squared
1001060	1003740	is equal to minus 1.
1003740	1011260	By grouping the real and imaginary parts together, we get the real part AC minus BD and the imaginary
1011260	1015700	part AD plus BC.
1016340	1024020	Don't have a standard way to multiply them, but we can easily define it in the same way.
1024020	1031900	Multiplying the matrices representing A plus B i and C plus D i gives AC minus BD on the
1031900	1039580	diagonal and AD plus BC and minus AD minus BC off the diagonal.
1039580	1045700	So the resulting 2 by 2 matrix represents the same complex number.
1045700	1050900	Okay, now we know that these representations are valid.
1050900	1056820	Each complex number A plus B i corresponds to the matrix with A on the diagonal and B
1056820	1062060	and minus B off the diagonal.
1062060	1067300	This matrix represents a geometric transformation, which one?
1067300	1068860	We know the drill.
1068860	1076060	The counts of this matrix describe the images of the vectors 1, 0 and 0, 1.
1076060	1083260	So 1, 0 is mapped to some vector AB, while 0, 1 is mapped to minus BA.
1083260	1089700	We also know that minus BA is the 90 degree rotation of AB.
1089700	1097740	Since both 1, 0 and 0, 1 are scaled by the common factor R equal to the length of AB,
1097740	1103260	one part of the transformation is scaling the plane.
1103260	1110900	Both 1, 0 and 0, 1 are also rotated by the angle phi, which is the angle of AB.
1110900	1117220	Therefore, the complex number A plus B i is the geometric transformation, which is the
1117220	1123540	composition of scaling the plane by the length of AB and rotating the plane by the angle
1123540	1127540	of AB.
1127540	1132060	Everything can be called amplification and rotation twists the plane.
1132060	1138940	Tristan need him, in his excellent book visual complex analysis, coined the beautiful term
1138940	1146980	ampli-twist to describe the geometric effect of complex multiplication.
1146980	1149980	Do you recall trigonometric form?
1149980	1156180	Many people when seeing this, lose all hope to ever understand complex numbers, but it
1156180	1158980	is not that complicated.
1158980	1165820	When reformulated to matrices, it states that the matrix on the left with A and B is equal
1165820	1171380	to the matrix on the right containing sines and cosines.
1171380	1179700	Our geometric argument already proves that these matrices are the same.
1179700	1185340	Complex numbers form a very efficient language to describe geometric transformations of the
1185340	1188780	plane and not just by multiplication.
1188780	1195500	Addition of a fixed complex number W to the plane corresponds to the translation of the
1195500	1198620	plane by this vector W.
1198620	1205540	As we already know, translation is not a linear transformation.
1205540	1210980	Multiplication by a fixed complex number W is the ampli-twist of the plane, which consists
1210980	1217860	of scaling the plane by the length of W and rotating it by the angle of W.
1217860	1224300	In this language, we can describe geometric transformations of a few basic complex values
1224300	1226300	as follows.
1226300	1233820	0, represented by the 0 matrix, collapses the entire plane into the origin.
1233820	1241380	1, represented by the identity matrix, is the identity transformation preserving the
1241380	1243460	entire plane.
1243460	1253540	I, represented by the matrix having 1 and minus 1 of the diagonal is the 90-degree rotation.
1253540	1262580	Minus 1, represented by the matrix having minus 1 on the diagonal is the 180-degree rotation.
1262580	1269260	And finally minus i, represented by the matrix having minus 1 and 1 of the diagonal is the
1269260	1278020	270-degree rotation of the plane, or the 90-degree rotation in the opposite direction.
1278020	1284540	So whenever one sees i in some equation, it can be understood as the 90-degree rotation
1284540	1286700	in some geometry.
1286700	1292100	There is nothing mysterious or imaginary about that.
1292100	1299420	Even the standard complex notation a plus bi can be understood as going a in the real
1299420	1307580	axis direction and then going b in this direction rotated by 90 degrees, which is the imaginary
1307580	1310220	axis direction.
1310220	1314820	But geometry of complex numbers does not end here.
1314820	1321940	The complex conjugation switches the sign of the imaginary part, so a plus bi is mapped
1321940	1324900	to a minus bi.
1324900	1331540	Geometrically, it is the reflection of the plane along the x-axis.
1331540	1337860	In the language of matrices, it corresponds to the matrix transpose 18.
1337860	1344180	Similarly, the division by a complex number can be explained geometrically.
1344180	1350380	More generally, there is a built-in family of Mabuse transformations, which map z to
1350380	1358660	az plus b divided by cz plus d, where abcd are some fixed complex numbers.
1358660	1364660	The excellent video below explores geometry of these transformations.
1364660	1371780	Also chapter 3 of visual complex analysis deals with this topic in detail.
1371780	1377420	In summary, we have explained two different geometric meanings of complex numbers.
1377420	1383300	They are points of the plane and they are geometric transformations of the plane, represented
1383300	1385940	with 2x2 matrices.
1385940	1393220	They are not numbers, similarly as we do not call matrices as matrix numbers.
1393220	1399420	Complex numbers form a very efficient language to describe geometric transformations of the
1399420	1402380	plane and beyond.
1402380	1408860	It is no wonder that they have found vast applications in all areas of mathematics, physics and
1408860	1411340	computer science.
1411340	1418740	Geometry is everywhere and efficient descriptions of it are very useful.
1418740	1425780	To explain geometry of the square root, let's first discuss the square operation.
1425780	1434260	In the context of real numbers, we get a square with the site x, whose area is x squared.
1434260	1438780	This is the reason why the square operation is called square.
1438780	1443460	Alternatively, we have the well-known graph of the parabola.
1443460	1449440	For a given value x, its value f of x is equal x squared.
1449440	1455140	On the other hand, a complex number is an amplitude transformation, so it is some scaling
1455140	1459340	by r and some rotation by phi.
1459340	1463980	Squaring this transformation means that it is applied twice.
1463980	1470500	When we scale twice by r, the total scaling effect is r squared.
1470500	1476700	And rotating twice by phi is the same as rotating once by 2 phi.
1476700	1485100	So z squared is the amplitude transformation, scaling by r squared and rotating by 2 phi.
1485100	1492660	For example, when z is the 90 degree rotation, we have already shown that z squared is the
1492660	1496860	180 degree rotation.
1496860	1501940	We get better geometric insight by squaring the entire plane.
1501940	1507900	Suppose that we smoothly morph the plane by moving each point towards its square.
1507900	1513740	This motion winds the plane twice around the origin since all angles are doubled.
1513740	1519420	For instance, the points of the spiral on the left go once around the origin while their
1519420	1522820	images go twice around.
1522820	1527680	We can understand this motion better by viewing it in three dimensions.
1527680	1532940	The complex plane is placed at the bottom and the images of the square transformation
1532940	1535820	are displayed by the colorful spiral.
1535820	1543100	We start at the bottom and as we rotate around, the images are placed higher and higher.
1543100	1548460	Notice that the images form two layers on top of every point of the plane with exception
1548460	1549460	of the origin.
1549460	1555940	A point z is squared to the same point as its 180 degree rotation which is equal to
1555940	1558860	minus z.
1558860	1565140	This 3D representation of z squared is closely related to the concept of Riemann's surfaces.
1565140	1570340	See this beautiful video for more visualizations.
1570340	1578500	As Gauss states, the origin of all this confusion is bad mathematical terminology and notation.
1578500	1585140	When using the same symbols for concepts of different meaning, it naturally reads to misunderstandings
1585140	1588020	and ideas are wrongly mixed.
1588020	1594340	As a freshman at university, I recall my calculus professor describing Coppac's analysis as
1594340	1599380	being exactly the same as real analysis for a while.
1599380	1604420	But then one gets all these wild surprising consequences.
1604420	1610220	It didn't make much sense to him since the same notation was used for ideas of completely
1610220	1613900	different meaning.
1613900	1616260	So what about the square root?
1616260	1618340	We start with the definition.
1618340	1622620	The square root is the inverse of the square operation.
1622620	1629660	Therefore, the square root of z is defined as a value w such that w squared is equal
1629660	1631300	to z.
1631300	1636220	In case of real geometry, we have a square of known area z.
1636220	1640620	We ask what is the length of the side of the square.
1640620	1648460	Since there is no square with negative area, the square root of a negative number is meaningless.
1648460	1655020	From complex geometry, we know that each complex number z is a geometric transformation.
1655020	1662660	Its square root is therefore another transformation w which becomes z when it is applied twice.
1662660	1668180	We just need to find it using geometry of complex numbers.
1668180	1670940	Let's take a look at a simple example.
1670940	1677220	We already know that minus one is the 180 degree rotation of the plane.
1677220	1685140	So we ask which amplitude transformation has to be applied twice to get this rotation.
1685140	1690340	Since minus one does not scale the plane, the unknown square root does not scale the
1690340	1692660	plane as well.
1692660	1699340	It is easy to see that applying either the 90 degree rotation or the minus 90 degree rotation
1699340	1704260	twice results into the 180 degree rotation.
1704260	1709980	So the square root of minus one is either i or minus i.
1709980	1715380	There is nothing magical or imaginary about that.
1715380	1721860	To understand the square root of an arbitrary complex number z, recall that it is some amplitude
1721860	1727860	transformation scaling the plane by r and rotating it by phi.
1727860	1735580	We want to find another amplitude transformation which becomes z when applied twice.
1735580	1742500	Concerning scaling, this transformation has to be scaled by the square root of r.
1742500	1748860	When the angle is half of phi, it becomes phi when applied twice.
1748860	1754340	So the amplitude scaling the plane by the square root of r and rotating it by half of
1754340	1760820	phi is a valid square root, but there is another one.
1760820	1767020	W is the square root of z when w squared is equal z.
1767020	1772540	The opposite point minus w is also squared to z.
1772540	1777300	It does the same scaling by the square root of r.
1777300	1783700	The angle of minus w has extra 180 degrees compared to w.
1783700	1791300	When minus w is applied twice, we get an additional rotation by 360 degrees which is the full
1791300	1793300	circle.
1793300	1801860	So the resulting amplitude minus w squared has the same angle as w squared.
1801860	1807500	We have already observed this behavior when we analyze the effect of the square transformation
1807500	1810060	in 3D.
1810060	1814940	Each point of the plane is covered by two layers of the image.
1814940	1821300	Suppose that we pierce the spiral from top at some point p for which we want to know
1821300	1824020	the square root.
1824020	1830060	If we undo the square motion, the spiral unwinds back into the plane.
1830060	1834820	It is pierced in two different points opposite to each other.
1834820	1839420	These two points are the square roots of p.
1839420	1845300	In summary, we have seen that both the square and the square root transformations have different
1845300	1848860	meanings for real and complex numbers.
1848860	1854580	In the real case, they describe the relation between the length of a side of a square and
1854580	1856620	its area.
1856620	1862140	In the complex case, geometric transformations are studied.
1862140	1866340	Squaring means that we apply some transformation twice.
1866340	1871740	For the square root of a transformation, we ask which another transformation has to be
1871740	1877140	applied twice to get this original transformation.
1877140	1885180	All confusion originates from bad mathematical notation such as the square root of minus 1.
1885180	1889220	There is nothing magical or imaginary about complex numbers.
1889220	1893380	It is just simple geometry.
1893380	1897460	I want to conclude this video with a personal story.
1897460	1903700	During my studies at Charles University in Braque, I was very lucky to meet Zdeniek Hedruin.
1903700	1910900	He was a Steyrczyk mathematician who studied algebra, category theory and graph theory.
1910900	1918260	Later in his life, he applied mathematics in various fields such as sociology, psychology,
1918260	1921300	biology and medicine.
1921300	1926940	Professor Hedruin spent a tremendous amount of time discussing with me everything from
1926940	1929740	mathematics to philosophy.
1929740	1935940	He became de facto my unofficial PhD supervisor and completely changed my life.
1935940	1941460	I still remember his beautiful description of complex analysis as the study of sinks
1941460	1946380	and vortexes, which took me several years to unpack.
1946380	1951180	Each complex function defines a certain flow in the plane.
1951180	1957660	Access, in the real value at some point, represented by the complex potential, creates
1957660	1959980	a source.
1959980	1965700	Imaginary complex potential creates a vortex, and we already know that it is geometrically
1965740	1967740	a rotation.
1967740	1972020	In general, some combination of these might happen.
1972020	1976780	See this interactive complex analysis book.
1976780	1980660	Zdeniek Hedruin has another connection to this video.
1980660	1987100	He spent the last 40 years of his life studying brain, how to model it with mathematics and
1987100	1990860	how to use computers to better understand it.
1990860	1998260	He died in spring 2018, and shortly before I promised to him that I will turn his idea
1998260	2002540	into a tool which can help a lot of people.
2002540	2008660	With my friends, we have spent the last 5 years realizing Hedruin's vision by building
2008660	2012380	this application called OrgPet.
2012380	2017420	I want to illustrate the strength of OrgPet on one concrete example.
2017420	2023660	My wife and I have played the computer game Zero's Escape, Virtus Last Reward.
2023660	2026980	This game consists of many logic and math puzzles.
2026980	2030620	In particular, the dice puzzle caught my attention.
2030620	2035540	In it, one reconfigures several dice by rolling them.
2035540	2042540	The goal is to place them in the center, while showing the prescribed numbers on top.
2042540	2048300	As a mathematician, I got interested in the following simplified problem.
2048300	2050540	Suppose that we have just a single dice.
2050540	2056340	We want to roll it a few times and finish in the same starting position.
2056340	2061620	The dice may end up with a different rotation than when it started.
2061620	2066980	The question is, what are all the possible rotations of the dice I can obtain in this
2066980	2068780	manner?
2068780	2074060	From my research, I knew that group theory is the right tool to attack this problem,
2074060	2076940	but details were not clear to me.
2076940	2082860	So I sat down in front of OrgPet for about 2 hours and built my understanding of this
2082860	2084660	problem.
2084660	2089300	There are 24 rotational symmetries of the dice forming a group.
2089300	2093100	To see its structure, I have built a calligraph.
2093100	2097740	Its vertices are these 24 rotational symmetries.
2097740	2104500	Let arrows rotate the dice to the right, while blue arrows rotate the dice forward.
2104500	2110980	This graph reveals the beautiful symmetrical structure hidden within the group.
2110980	2117260	To end up in the same place, necessarily an even number of rotations has to be applied.
2117260	2124140	Therefore, starting in a pink vertex means that we have to end up in another pink vertex.
2124140	2129060	So only 12 of these rotations can theoretically be reached.
2129060	2135700	While playing the game, I was able to generate many rotations by cycling the dice.
2135700	2139780	Moving it, say left, forward, right, backwards.
2139780	2141180	But how many?
2141180	2146820	And what if we introduce some other sequence of four moves, say rotating the dice right,
2146820	2149140	forward, left, backwards.
2149140	2153500	I analyze this situation in OrgPet.
2153500	2158660	When we apply a single of these four move sequences repeatedly, we cycle through three
2158660	2161780	different rotations of the dice.
2161780	2167420	But when we apply both of them, all 12 possible rotations can be reached.
2167420	2171540	The structure is again depicted by a calligraph.
2171540	2176300	If you are interested in more details, let me know in the comments.
2176300	2181980	I can make a longer video about this problem and group theory.
2181980	2188180	This is a general way to build understanding and OrgPet is a great tool for that.
2188180	2193820	Just throw your unclear ideas there, play with them and you can immediately benefit
2193820	2195860	from better understanding.
2195860	2202780	Moreover, since OrgPet is based on Hedereen's 40 years long research of human brain, it
2202780	2208460	allows one to capture ideas much more faithfully than when writing them down on a piece of
2208460	2211620	paper or into a book.
2211620	2217020	Using this, better understanding can be obtained much, much faster.
2217020	2223460	As a side effect, since you see your ideas playing right in front of you, better understanding
2223460	2226200	of your own brain is built.
2226200	2232580	And I would argue that the brain is the single most important tool of one's life.
2232580	2238820	In summary, OrgPet is a tool for improving understanding of both problems and your brain
2238820	2240500	itself.
2240500	2245940	You can experiment with OrgPet at the address orgpet.com.
2245940	2250580	If you find it helpful, it would be great if you can support our work.
2250580	2256200	You can save 20% by using the promo code SUM3.
2256200	2257840	One more thing.
2257840	2264620	I have mentioned in the beginning that I consider these mathematical jokes rather silly.
2264620	2271180	As a bonus for watching this video till the end, let me show you two math jokes I find
2271180	2275620	absolutely amazing.
2275620	2279420	Do you know why Romans sucked in algebra?
2279420	2282340	Because X was always 10.
2282340	2286340	We are counting in the base 10 numbers.
2286340	2289700	Mayans use the base 20 numeric system.
2289700	2292100	Do you know why?
2292100	2319180	Because they did not wear shoes.
