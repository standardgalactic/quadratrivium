00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,200
Hi, I have a confession to make, I absolutely love complex numbers.

2
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:12,720
They are one of the most amazing ideas in all of mathematics.

3
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:18,080
What I despise is mystic and darkness surrounding them.

4
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:20,480
Look at these silly jokes.

5
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:27,560
Non-Math people think that mathematicians are crazy and jokes like these only reinforce

6
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:28,860
that.

7
00:00:28,860 --> 00:00:35,260
It makes me sad, since mathematics is full of the most amazing ideas.

8
00:00:35,260 --> 00:00:39,460
Unfortunately, they remain hidden.

9
00:00:39,460 --> 00:00:44,460
Jokes aside, Veritasil made this video about complex numbers.

10
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:50,580
While it beautifully explains the history, it also contains some weird statements like

11
00:00:50,580 --> 00:00:52,780
this one.

12
00:00:52,780 --> 00:00:59,260
Only by abandoning math's connection to reality could we discover reality's true nature.

13
00:00:59,260 --> 00:01:01,180
What a nonsense.

14
00:01:01,180 --> 00:01:05,420
I will show you that complex numbers are completely natural.

15
00:01:05,420 --> 00:01:09,820
Moreover, this is known for over 200 years.

16
00:01:09,820 --> 00:01:15,820
The point here is not to trash their ex-work, as I am a huge fan of Veritasium.

17
00:01:15,820 --> 00:01:22,860
It just highlights the amount of confusion and darkness surrounding complex numbers.

18
00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:29,500
We weigh so much potential of countless people by teaching complex numbers as these mysterious

19
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:31,820
imaginary entities.

20
00:01:31,820 --> 00:01:35,140
This has to stop.

21
00:01:35,140 --> 00:01:39,980
The goal of this video is to demystify complex numbers.

22
00:01:39,980 --> 00:01:46,460
I will fully explain that they describe geometric transformations of the plane.

23
00:01:46,460 --> 00:01:52,380
And we will show that the only source of confusion about square roots of negative numbers is

24
00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:56,620
our bad terminology and notation.

25
00:01:56,620 --> 00:02:00,340
We start with a little bit of historical context.

26
00:02:00,340 --> 00:02:05,780
In high school, I was told that complex numbers were invented to add solutions to the quadratic

27
00:02:05,780 --> 00:02:09,820
formula when real ones do not exist.

28
00:02:09,820 --> 00:02:17,300
This doesn't make any sense, since the well-known graph of parabola does not intersect the x-axis.

29
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:20,060
So there are no solutions.

30
00:02:20,060 --> 00:02:25,900
Complex numbers were actually discovered while studying cubic polynomials, which always intersect

31
00:02:25,900 --> 00:02:29,260
the x-axis.

32
00:02:29,260 --> 00:02:35,860
The general solution of the cubic equation was first described by Cardano in 1545 in his

33
00:02:35,860 --> 00:02:38,420
book Artis Magna.

34
00:02:38,420 --> 00:02:43,380
In one formula, square roots of negative numbers were encountered.

35
00:02:43,380 --> 00:02:49,100
But they did cancel out in the end and produced a correct real solution.

36
00:02:49,100 --> 00:02:55,900
Cardano himself commented this case by saying s subtl as it is useless.

37
00:02:55,900 --> 00:02:58,460
But it caught the attention of Bombelli.

38
00:02:58,460 --> 00:03:03,860
In his two books on algebra, he performed the first substantial calculations with complex

39
00:03:03,860 --> 00:03:04,860
numbers.

40
00:03:05,660 --> 00:03:12,700
He called the square root of minus 1 nowadays denoted i as the plus of minus.

41
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:15,820
This is everything I want to say about these equations.

42
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:20,500
If you want to know more, I recommend the excellent history description in the Veritasium

43
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:21,500
video.

44
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:26,540
There is also a discussion with Ribou Van Braun, which explains mathematics behind

45
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:29,380
cubic and quadratic formulas.

46
00:03:29,380 --> 00:03:36,420
These two videos by Matemaniac and not all wrong show why there is no Quintic formula.

47
00:03:36,420 --> 00:03:40,140
If you want to explore all these extra materials, don't worry.

48
00:03:40,140 --> 00:03:46,380
This presentation is built in the online application ORPAD, of which I am one of the creators.

49
00:03:46,380 --> 00:03:51,300
You can find a link to this presentation in the video description.

50
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:53,940
Let's go back to complex numbers.

51
00:03:53,940 --> 00:03:59,060
Even after 100 years, they were still viewed with suspicion and disbelief.

52
00:03:59,060 --> 00:04:04,660
The cart associated imaginary numbers with geometric impossibility.

53
00:04:04,660 --> 00:04:10,900
He coined the term imaginary, basically stating that one can invent solutions of an equation,

54
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:17,380
but it does not mean that these imaginary quantities have any real meaning.

55
00:04:17,380 --> 00:04:22,860
Even the magician Euler called complex numbers impossible while proving many substantial

56
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:24,380
results.

57
00:04:24,380 --> 00:04:30,820
He also introduced the notation I for the square root of minus 1.

58
00:04:30,820 --> 00:04:37,100
Shortly after, Wessel and Argan first described geometry of complex numbers, but their work

59
00:04:37,100 --> 00:04:38,660
was not widely known.

60
00:04:38,660 --> 00:04:45,460
Only when the prominent mathematician Gauss described this geometry in 1831, people took

61
00:04:45,460 --> 00:04:46,460
notice.

62
00:04:46,460 --> 00:04:52,820
While working on this video, I discovered a great boat by Gauss that accurately reflects

63
00:04:52,820 --> 00:04:59,460
my approach to explaining complex numbers.

64
00:04:59,460 --> 00:05:04,460
If this subject has either to been considered from the wrong viewpoint and thus enveloped

65
00:05:04,460 --> 00:05:09,900
in mystery and surrounded by darkness, it is largely an unsuitable terminology which

66
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:11,700
should be blamed.

67
00:05:11,700 --> 00:05:19,260
Had plus 1, minus 1 and square root of minus 1, instead of being called positive, negative

68
00:05:19,260 --> 00:05:27,180
and imaginary or worse still impossible unity, being given the name say of direct, inverse

69
00:05:27,180 --> 00:05:33,420
and lateral unity, there would hardly have been any scope for such obscurity.

70
00:05:33,420 --> 00:05:37,940
Wow, I love this so much.

71
00:05:37,940 --> 00:05:43,220
Mathematicians notice Gauss' work, fix their misunderstandings and all mystery of complex

72
00:05:43,220 --> 00:05:44,980
numbers is gone.

73
00:05:44,980 --> 00:05:48,300
Sadly, that's not the case.

74
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:54,020
The amount of mystic and darkness has only grown.

75
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:59,220
Traveling back in time to Descartes and Euler, it makes sense that imaginary numbers raised

76
00:05:59,220 --> 00:06:01,700
eyebrows and doubts.

77
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:08,220
But thanks to Gauss' brilliant insights, we can no longer use ignorance as an excuse.

78
00:06:08,220 --> 00:06:15,860
Yet, even after 200 years, the Gauss' work is still misunderstood and he is furious about

79
00:06:15,860 --> 00:06:16,860
that.

80
00:06:16,860 --> 00:06:19,060
Let's fix it in this video.

81
00:06:19,060 --> 00:06:25,740
With the great power of the internet, you can help by watching, liking and adding some

82
00:06:25,740 --> 00:06:32,220
comments so we can together be the almighty YouTube algorithm.

83
00:06:32,220 --> 00:06:38,500
Please share this video with your family and friends, educate your grandma and explain it

84
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:42,500
even to your dog.

85
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:48,220
Let's sidestep the complex numbers for a second and talk about plane geometry.

86
00:06:48,220 --> 00:06:53,540
If you are familiar with vectors, matrices and their geometric meaning, feel free to

87
00:06:53,540 --> 00:06:56,780
skip to the next chapter.

88
00:06:56,780 --> 00:07:03,260
All points of the plane, also called vectors, can be described as pairs of numbers representing

89
00:07:03,260 --> 00:07:07,860
the coordinates on the x and y axis.

90
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:14,500
Vectors can be added by summing their coordinates, corresponding to adding forces in physics.

91
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:20,820
And vectors can be scaled by an arbitrary number alpha, making the resulting vector longer

92
00:07:20,820 --> 00:07:22,740
or shorter.

93
00:07:22,740 --> 00:07:28,500
If alpha is negative, the direction of the vector is sweet.

94
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:32,180
We can apply geometric transformations of the plane.

95
00:07:32,180 --> 00:07:38,220
You are probably familiar with these from computer graphic editors.

96
00:07:38,220 --> 00:07:44,420
The entire plane can be scaled by some factor, which scales all the vectors.

97
00:07:44,420 --> 00:07:50,500
We can also rotate all the vectors around the origin by some angle, and the plane can

98
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:56,220
be reflected along some line x axis in this example.

99
00:07:56,220 --> 00:08:00,060
All these transformations have one thing in common.

100
00:08:00,060 --> 00:08:05,300
Their pictures display two vectors u and v, and their sum u plus v.

101
00:08:05,300 --> 00:08:12,020
Notice that it doesn't matter whether we first add them and then transform the result,

102
00:08:12,020 --> 00:08:16,900
or whether we add u and v already transformed.

103
00:08:16,900 --> 00:08:20,820
In both situations, we get the same result.

104
00:08:20,820 --> 00:08:27,260
In other words, this equality is always satisfied.

105
00:08:27,260 --> 00:08:34,220
Transforms of the plane which satisfy this equality and also a similar equality for scaling

106
00:08:34,220 --> 00:08:36,340
are called linear.

107
00:08:36,340 --> 00:08:40,580
All previously shown transformations are linear.

108
00:08:40,580 --> 00:08:46,340
By using alpha equals zero, it easily follows that every linear transformation preserves

109
00:08:46,340 --> 00:08:48,140
the origin.

110
00:08:48,140 --> 00:08:54,060
So a notable nonlinear transformation is the translation of the plane by some vector,

111
00:08:54,060 --> 00:08:59,100
which means adding this vector to all vectors in the plane.

112
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:03,180
Suppose that we have some linear transformation f.

113
00:09:03,180 --> 00:09:09,100
What is the least amount of information we need to know to fully describe it?

114
00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:13,100
It turns out that not that much is needed.

115
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:22,660
Notice that any vector xy can be expressed as the sum of x times 1 0 with y times 0 1.

116
00:09:22,660 --> 00:09:30,340
By linearity, it follows that the image of xy is fully determined by the images of 1 0

117
00:09:30,340 --> 00:09:32,300
and 0 1.

118
00:09:32,300 --> 00:09:39,740
We know that the image of 1 0 is some vector a b and the image of 0 1 is some other vector

119
00:09:39,740 --> 00:09:41,540
c d.

120
00:09:41,540 --> 00:09:51,140
In total, f is fully described by four numbers a b c d, which are placed in a 2 by 2 table.

121
00:09:51,140 --> 00:09:57,620
The first column represents the image of 1 0, while the second column represents the

122
00:09:57,620 --> 00:09:59,900
image of 0 1.

123
00:09:59,900 --> 00:10:02,940
This table is called a matrix.

124
00:10:02,940 --> 00:10:09,460
Let's see some examples, which will be important later when we describe geometry of complex

125
00:10:09,460 --> 00:10:11,140
numbers.

126
00:10:11,140 --> 00:10:17,060
When every vector of the plane is scaled by some factor r, the vector 1 0 is mapped to

127
00:10:17,060 --> 00:10:21,780
r 0 and 0 1 is mapped to 0 r.

128
00:10:21,780 --> 00:10:29,320
So the resulting matrix is the diagonal matrix with r on the diagonal.

129
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:35,860
For the 90 degree rotation, the vector 1 0 is mapped to the other vector 0 1, while

130
00:10:35,860 --> 00:10:40,380
0 1 is mapped to minus 1 0.

131
00:10:40,380 --> 00:10:49,340
So the resulting matrix has 0 on the diagonal and plus 1 and minus 1 of the diagonal.

132
00:10:49,340 --> 00:10:54,940
The matrix of an arbitrary rotation is a little bit more involved.

133
00:10:54,940 --> 00:11:03,900
From geometry, 1 0 is rotated to the coordinates cosine phi and sine phi, which are the coordinates

134
00:11:03,900 --> 00:11:08,500
of the point on the unit circle with the angle phi.

135
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:15,020
The other vector 0 1 is rotated by further 90 degrees to the point, which after some

136
00:11:15,020 --> 00:11:20,600
simplifications has the coordinates minus sine phi and cosine phi.

137
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:27,140
So the resulting matrix has cosine phi on the diagonal and sine phi and minus sine phi

138
00:11:27,140 --> 00:11:29,140
of the diagonal.

139
00:11:29,140 --> 00:11:36,500
Okay, we know that each linear transformation is represented by some 2 by 2 matrix.

140
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:37,500
So what?

141
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:40,460
Who is this information useful?

142
00:11:40,460 --> 00:11:46,380
It would be great to use this matrix to describe the image of an input vector x y.

143
00:11:46,380 --> 00:11:54,260
Recall that the image of x y is a combination of the images of 1 0 and 0 1, which are described

144
00:11:54,260 --> 00:11:57,260
by the columns of the matrix.

145
00:11:57,260 --> 00:12:02,740
So we can just scale the first column by x and scale the second one by y and sum them

146
00:12:02,740 --> 00:12:04,500
together.

147
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:09,220
This is precisely how matrix vector multiplication works.

148
00:12:09,220 --> 00:12:15,820
So to find the image of x y, we just need to multiply it by the matrix.

149
00:12:15,820 --> 00:12:19,620
Let's apply this knowledge on the 90 degree rotation.

150
00:12:19,620 --> 00:12:25,700
We already know the rotation matrix, so by multiplying x y with it, we get the vector

151
00:12:25,700 --> 00:12:27,860
minus y x.

152
00:12:27,860 --> 00:12:31,660
This is a neat trick I already discovered at high school.

153
00:12:31,660 --> 00:12:37,180
To rotate a plane vector by 90 degrees, we just need to swap the coordinates and switch

154
00:12:37,180 --> 00:12:39,660
the sign of one of them.

155
00:12:39,660 --> 00:12:44,140
This nicely explains the matrix of an arbitrary rotation.

156
00:12:44,140 --> 00:12:49,540
The image of the blue vector is obtained by rotating the image of the red vector by 90

157
00:12:49,540 --> 00:12:50,540
degrees.

158
00:12:50,540 --> 00:12:58,940
The coordinates of cosine phi, sine phi are swapped and the sine of sine phi is switched.

159
00:12:58,940 --> 00:13:01,540
Linear transformations can be chained.

160
00:13:01,540 --> 00:13:07,220
We first map the plane by a linear transformation F and then map the images by another linear

161
00:13:07,220 --> 00:13:13,500
transformation G. The resulting composite transformation is again linear.

162
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:20,820
It turns out that it is represented by the matrix multiplication B times A.

163
00:13:20,820 --> 00:13:28,380
For example, when we apply the 90 degree rotation twice, it becomes the 180 degree rotation.

164
00:13:28,380 --> 00:13:32,940
We already know the matrix A of the 90 degree rotation.

165
00:13:32,940 --> 00:13:41,500
The matrix of the 180 degree rotation is obtained by multiplying A with A, which is A squared.

166
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:47,820
Since the 180 degree rotation flips each vector, it is correctly represented by the matrix

167
00:13:47,820 --> 00:13:50,260
A squared.

168
00:13:50,260 --> 00:13:56,460
In summary, we have seen that points of the plane are represented by two coordinate vectors

169
00:13:56,580 --> 00:14:01,700
while their transformations are described with two by two matrices.

170
00:14:01,700 --> 00:14:09,100
Whenever you see a matrix, geometric it corresponds to some linear transformation.

171
00:14:09,100 --> 00:14:15,420
I believe the concept of linear transformations and their matrix representation is the single

172
00:14:15,420 --> 00:14:20,020
most important idea in all of mathematics.

173
00:14:20,020 --> 00:14:26,580
For instance, the derivative of a function satisfies these equalities, so it is a linear

174
00:14:26,580 --> 00:14:28,900
transformation.

175
00:14:28,900 --> 00:14:34,580
If you want to learn more about linear transformations, I recommend this excellent book by Gilbert

176
00:14:34,580 --> 00:14:36,300
Strang.

177
00:14:36,300 --> 00:14:42,420
You can also check out a free Boolean Brown video that uses animation to explain linear

178
00:14:42,420 --> 00:14:44,900
transformations.

179
00:14:44,900 --> 00:14:49,980
I taught linear algebra for several years and have written a few books in check about

180
00:14:49,980 --> 00:14:50,980
it.

181
00:14:50,980 --> 00:14:57,900
Needless to say, it is one of my favorite topics in mathematics.

182
00:14:57,900 --> 00:15:04,260
With the built geometric understanding, we are finally ready to tackle complex numbers.

183
00:15:04,260 --> 00:15:08,340
They actually have two different geometric meanings.

184
00:15:08,340 --> 00:15:13,700
The first meaning states that the complex number A plus B i corresponds to the vector

185
00:15:13,700 --> 00:15:20,780
A B. The fact that all complex numbers form the two-dimensional plane is well known and

186
00:15:20,780 --> 00:15:24,660
it is often called gauss-complex plane.

187
00:15:24,660 --> 00:15:31,220
There is some evidence that this was already known to Euler.

188
00:15:31,220 --> 00:15:34,940
The other geometric meaning is much less known.

189
00:15:34,940 --> 00:15:42,060
The complex number A plus B i corresponds to the 2 by 2 matrix with A on the diagonal

190
00:15:42,060 --> 00:15:45,900
and B and minus B off the diagonal.

191
00:15:45,900 --> 00:15:52,380
At this moment, it is not clear why one should place A and B into a matrix like this, so

192
00:15:52,380 --> 00:15:54,420
consider it a lucky guess.

193
00:15:54,420 --> 00:16:02,260
We will show that it reveals geometry of complex numbers hidden for centuries.

194
00:16:02,260 --> 00:16:08,440
To see that these representations are valid, we have to prove that addition and multiplication

195
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:14,500
works for them in the same way as for A plus B i.

196
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:20,300
Complex numbers are added by independently summing the real and imaginary parts.

197
00:16:20,300 --> 00:16:27,580
Similarly, vectors and matrices are added by independently summing their coordinates.

198
00:16:27,580 --> 00:16:33,660
So we get the same complex number having the real part A plus C and the imaginary part

199
00:16:33,660 --> 00:16:41,060
B plus D. Complex numbers are multiplied by multiplying the parentheses where i squared

200
00:16:41,060 --> 00:16:43,740
is equal to minus 1.

201
00:16:43,740 --> 00:16:51,260
By grouping the real and imaginary parts together, we get the real part AC minus BD and the imaginary

202
00:16:51,260 --> 00:16:55,700
part AD plus BC.

203
00:16:56,340 --> 00:17:04,020
Don't have a standard way to multiply them, but we can easily define it in the same way.

204
00:17:04,020 --> 00:17:11,900
Multiplying the matrices representing A plus B i and C plus D i gives AC minus BD on the

205
00:17:11,900 --> 00:17:19,580
diagonal and AD plus BC and minus AD minus BC off the diagonal.

206
00:17:19,580 --> 00:17:25,700
So the resulting 2 by 2 matrix represents the same complex number.

207
00:17:25,700 --> 00:17:30,900
Okay, now we know that these representations are valid.

208
00:17:30,900 --> 00:17:36,820
Each complex number A plus B i corresponds to the matrix with A on the diagonal and B

209
00:17:36,820 --> 00:17:42,060
and minus B off the diagonal.

210
00:17:42,060 --> 00:17:47,300
This matrix represents a geometric transformation, which one?

211
00:17:47,300 --> 00:17:48,860
We know the drill.

212
00:17:48,860 --> 00:17:56,060
The counts of this matrix describe the images of the vectors 1, 0 and 0, 1.

213
00:17:56,060 --> 00:18:03,260
So 1, 0 is mapped to some vector AB, while 0, 1 is mapped to minus BA.

214
00:18:03,260 --> 00:18:09,700
We also know that minus BA is the 90 degree rotation of AB.

215
00:18:09,700 --> 00:18:17,740
Since both 1, 0 and 0, 1 are scaled by the common factor R equal to the length of AB,

216
00:18:17,740 --> 00:18:23,260
one part of the transformation is scaling the plane.

217
00:18:23,260 --> 00:18:30,900
Both 1, 0 and 0, 1 are also rotated by the angle phi, which is the angle of AB.

218
00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:37,220
Therefore, the complex number A plus B i is the geometric transformation, which is the

219
00:18:37,220 --> 00:18:43,540
composition of scaling the plane by the length of AB and rotating the plane by the angle

220
00:18:43,540 --> 00:18:47,540
of AB.

221
00:18:47,540 --> 00:18:52,060
Everything can be called amplification and rotation twists the plane.

222
00:18:52,060 --> 00:18:58,940
Tristan need him, in his excellent book visual complex analysis, coined the beautiful term

223
00:18:58,940 --> 00:19:06,980
ampli-twist to describe the geometric effect of complex multiplication.

224
00:19:06,980 --> 00:19:09,980
Do you recall trigonometric form?

225
00:19:09,980 --> 00:19:16,180
Many people when seeing this, lose all hope to ever understand complex numbers, but it

226
00:19:16,180 --> 00:19:18,980
is not that complicated.

227
00:19:18,980 --> 00:19:25,820
When reformulated to matrices, it states that the matrix on the left with A and B is equal

228
00:19:25,820 --> 00:19:31,380
to the matrix on the right containing sines and cosines.

229
00:19:31,380 --> 00:19:39,700
Our geometric argument already proves that these matrices are the same.

230
00:19:39,700 --> 00:19:45,340
Complex numbers form a very efficient language to describe geometric transformations of the

231
00:19:45,340 --> 00:19:48,780
plane and not just by multiplication.

232
00:19:48,780 --> 00:19:55,500
Addition of a fixed complex number W to the plane corresponds to the translation of the

233
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:58,620
plane by this vector W.

234
00:19:58,620 --> 00:20:05,540
As we already know, translation is not a linear transformation.

235
00:20:05,540 --> 00:20:10,980
Multiplication by a fixed complex number W is the ampli-twist of the plane, which consists

236
00:20:10,980 --> 00:20:17,860
of scaling the plane by the length of W and rotating it by the angle of W.

237
00:20:17,860 --> 00:20:24,300
In this language, we can describe geometric transformations of a few basic complex values

238
00:20:24,300 --> 00:20:26,300
as follows.

239
00:20:26,300 --> 00:20:33,820
0, represented by the 0 matrix, collapses the entire plane into the origin.

240
00:20:33,820 --> 00:20:41,380
1, represented by the identity matrix, is the identity transformation preserving the

241
00:20:41,380 --> 00:20:43,460
entire plane.

242
00:20:43,460 --> 00:20:53,540
I, represented by the matrix having 1 and minus 1 of the diagonal is the 90-degree rotation.

243
00:20:53,540 --> 00:21:02,580
Minus 1, represented by the matrix having minus 1 on the diagonal is the 180-degree rotation.

244
00:21:02,580 --> 00:21:09,260
And finally minus i, represented by the matrix having minus 1 and 1 of the diagonal is the

245
00:21:09,260 --> 00:21:18,020
270-degree rotation of the plane, or the 90-degree rotation in the opposite direction.

246
00:21:18,020 --> 00:21:24,540
So whenever one sees i in some equation, it can be understood as the 90-degree rotation

247
00:21:24,540 --> 00:21:26,700
in some geometry.

248
00:21:26,700 --> 00:21:32,100
There is nothing mysterious or imaginary about that.

249
00:21:32,100 --> 00:21:39,420
Even the standard complex notation a plus bi can be understood as going a in the real

250
00:21:39,420 --> 00:21:47,580
axis direction and then going b in this direction rotated by 90 degrees, which is the imaginary

251
00:21:47,580 --> 00:21:50,220
axis direction.

252
00:21:50,220 --> 00:21:54,820
But geometry of complex numbers does not end here.

253
00:21:54,820 --> 00:22:01,940
The complex conjugation switches the sign of the imaginary part, so a plus bi is mapped

254
00:22:01,940 --> 00:22:04,900
to a minus bi.

255
00:22:04,900 --> 00:22:11,540
Geometrically, it is the reflection of the plane along the x-axis.

256
00:22:11,540 --> 00:22:17,860
In the language of matrices, it corresponds to the matrix transpose 18.

257
00:22:17,860 --> 00:22:24,180
Similarly, the division by a complex number can be explained geometrically.

258
00:22:24,180 --> 00:22:30,380
More generally, there is a built-in family of Mabuse transformations, which map z to

259
00:22:30,380 --> 00:22:38,660
az plus b divided by cz plus d, where abcd are some fixed complex numbers.

260
00:22:38,660 --> 00:22:44,660
The excellent video below explores geometry of these transformations.

261
00:22:44,660 --> 00:22:51,780
Also chapter 3 of visual complex analysis deals with this topic in detail.

262
00:22:51,780 --> 00:22:57,420
In summary, we have explained two different geometric meanings of complex numbers.

263
00:22:57,420 --> 00:23:03,300
They are points of the plane and they are geometric transformations of the plane, represented

264
00:23:03,300 --> 00:23:05,940
with 2x2 matrices.

265
00:23:05,940 --> 00:23:13,220
They are not numbers, similarly as we do not call matrices as matrix numbers.

266
00:23:13,220 --> 00:23:19,420
Complex numbers form a very efficient language to describe geometric transformations of the

267
00:23:19,420 --> 00:23:22,380
plane and beyond.

268
00:23:22,380 --> 00:23:28,860
It is no wonder that they have found vast applications in all areas of mathematics, physics and

269
00:23:28,860 --> 00:23:31,340
computer science.

270
00:23:31,340 --> 00:23:38,740
Geometry is everywhere and efficient descriptions of it are very useful.

271
00:23:38,740 --> 00:23:45,780
To explain geometry of the square root, let's first discuss the square operation.

272
00:23:45,780 --> 00:23:54,260
In the context of real numbers, we get a square with the site x, whose area is x squared.

273
00:23:54,260 --> 00:23:58,780
This is the reason why the square operation is called square.

274
00:23:58,780 --> 00:24:03,460
Alternatively, we have the well-known graph of the parabola.

275
00:24:03,460 --> 00:24:09,440
For a given value x, its value f of x is equal x squared.

276
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:15,140
On the other hand, a complex number is an amplitude transformation, so it is some scaling

277
00:24:15,140 --> 00:24:19,340
by r and some rotation by phi.

278
00:24:19,340 --> 00:24:23,980
Squaring this transformation means that it is applied twice.

279
00:24:23,980 --> 00:24:30,500
When we scale twice by r, the total scaling effect is r squared.

280
00:24:30,500 --> 00:24:36,700
And rotating twice by phi is the same as rotating once by 2 phi.

281
00:24:36,700 --> 00:24:45,100
So z squared is the amplitude transformation, scaling by r squared and rotating by 2 phi.

282
00:24:45,100 --> 00:24:52,660
For example, when z is the 90 degree rotation, we have already shown that z squared is the

283
00:24:52,660 --> 00:24:56,860
180 degree rotation.

284
00:24:56,860 --> 00:25:01,940
We get better geometric insight by squaring the entire plane.

285
00:25:01,940 --> 00:25:07,900
Suppose that we smoothly morph the plane by moving each point towards its square.

286
00:25:07,900 --> 00:25:13,740
This motion winds the plane twice around the origin since all angles are doubled.

287
00:25:13,740 --> 00:25:19,420
For instance, the points of the spiral on the left go once around the origin while their

288
00:25:19,420 --> 00:25:22,820
images go twice around.

289
00:25:22,820 --> 00:25:27,680
We can understand this motion better by viewing it in three dimensions.

290
00:25:27,680 --> 00:25:32,940
The complex plane is placed at the bottom and the images of the square transformation

291
00:25:32,940 --> 00:25:35,820
are displayed by the colorful spiral.

292
00:25:35,820 --> 00:25:43,100
We start at the bottom and as we rotate around, the images are placed higher and higher.

293
00:25:43,100 --> 00:25:48,460
Notice that the images form two layers on top of every point of the plane with exception

294
00:25:48,460 --> 00:25:49,460
of the origin.

295
00:25:49,460 --> 00:25:55,940
A point z is squared to the same point as its 180 degree rotation which is equal to

296
00:25:55,940 --> 00:25:58,860
minus z.

297
00:25:58,860 --> 00:26:05,140
This 3D representation of z squared is closely related to the concept of Riemann's surfaces.

298
00:26:05,140 --> 00:26:10,340
See this beautiful video for more visualizations.

299
00:26:10,340 --> 00:26:18,500
As Gauss states, the origin of all this confusion is bad mathematical terminology and notation.

300
00:26:18,500 --> 00:26:25,140
When using the same symbols for concepts of different meaning, it naturally reads to misunderstandings

301
00:26:25,140 --> 00:26:28,020
and ideas are wrongly mixed.

302
00:26:28,020 --> 00:26:34,340
As a freshman at university, I recall my calculus professor describing Coppac's analysis as

303
00:26:34,340 --> 00:26:39,380
being exactly the same as real analysis for a while.

304
00:26:39,380 --> 00:26:44,420
But then one gets all these wild surprising consequences.

305
00:26:44,420 --> 00:26:50,220
It didn't make much sense to him since the same notation was used for ideas of completely

306
00:26:50,220 --> 00:26:53,900
different meaning.

307
00:26:53,900 --> 00:26:56,260
So what about the square root?

308
00:26:56,260 --> 00:26:58,340
We start with the definition.

309
00:26:58,340 --> 00:27:02,620
The square root is the inverse of the square operation.

310
00:27:02,620 --> 00:27:09,660
Therefore, the square root of z is defined as a value w such that w squared is equal

311
00:27:09,660 --> 00:27:11,300
to z.

312
00:27:11,300 --> 00:27:16,220
In case of real geometry, we have a square of known area z.

313
00:27:16,220 --> 00:27:20,620
We ask what is the length of the side of the square.

314
00:27:20,620 --> 00:27:28,460
Since there is no square with negative area, the square root of a negative number is meaningless.

315
00:27:28,460 --> 00:27:35,020
From complex geometry, we know that each complex number z is a geometric transformation.

316
00:27:35,020 --> 00:27:42,660
Its square root is therefore another transformation w which becomes z when it is applied twice.

317
00:27:42,660 --> 00:27:48,180
We just need to find it using geometry of complex numbers.

318
00:27:48,180 --> 00:27:50,940
Let's take a look at a simple example.

319
00:27:50,940 --> 00:27:57,220
We already know that minus one is the 180 degree rotation of the plane.

320
00:27:57,220 --> 00:28:05,140
So we ask which amplitude transformation has to be applied twice to get this rotation.

321
00:28:05,140 --> 00:28:10,340
Since minus one does not scale the plane, the unknown square root does not scale the

322
00:28:10,340 --> 00:28:12,660
plane as well.

323
00:28:12,660 --> 00:28:19,340
It is easy to see that applying either the 90 degree rotation or the minus 90 degree rotation

324
00:28:19,340 --> 00:28:24,260
twice results into the 180 degree rotation.

325
00:28:24,260 --> 00:28:29,980
So the square root of minus one is either i or minus i.

326
00:28:29,980 --> 00:28:35,380
There is nothing magical or imaginary about that.

327
00:28:35,380 --> 00:28:41,860
To understand the square root of an arbitrary complex number z, recall that it is some amplitude

328
00:28:41,860 --> 00:28:47,860
transformation scaling the plane by r and rotating it by phi.

329
00:28:47,860 --> 00:28:55,580
We want to find another amplitude transformation which becomes z when applied twice.

330
00:28:55,580 --> 00:29:02,500
Concerning scaling, this transformation has to be scaled by the square root of r.

331
00:29:02,500 --> 00:29:08,860
When the angle is half of phi, it becomes phi when applied twice.

332
00:29:08,860 --> 00:29:14,340
So the amplitude scaling the plane by the square root of r and rotating it by half of

333
00:29:14,340 --> 00:29:20,820
phi is a valid square root, but there is another one.

334
00:29:20,820 --> 00:29:27,020
W is the square root of z when w squared is equal z.

335
00:29:27,020 --> 00:29:32,540
The opposite point minus w is also squared to z.

336
00:29:32,540 --> 00:29:37,300
It does the same scaling by the square root of r.

337
00:29:37,300 --> 00:29:43,700
The angle of minus w has extra 180 degrees compared to w.

338
00:29:43,700 --> 00:29:51,300
When minus w is applied twice, we get an additional rotation by 360 degrees which is the full

339
00:29:51,300 --> 00:29:53,300
circle.

340
00:29:53,300 --> 00:30:01,860
So the resulting amplitude minus w squared has the same angle as w squared.

341
00:30:01,860 --> 00:30:07,500
We have already observed this behavior when we analyze the effect of the square transformation

342
00:30:07,500 --> 00:30:10,060
in 3D.

343
00:30:10,060 --> 00:30:14,940
Each point of the plane is covered by two layers of the image.

344
00:30:14,940 --> 00:30:21,300
Suppose that we pierce the spiral from top at some point p for which we want to know

345
00:30:21,300 --> 00:30:24,020
the square root.

346
00:30:24,020 --> 00:30:30,060
If we undo the square motion, the spiral unwinds back into the plane.

347
00:30:30,060 --> 00:30:34,820
It is pierced in two different points opposite to each other.

348
00:30:34,820 --> 00:30:39,420
These two points are the square roots of p.

349
00:30:39,420 --> 00:30:45,300
In summary, we have seen that both the square and the square root transformations have different

350
00:30:45,300 --> 00:30:48,860
meanings for real and complex numbers.

351
00:30:48,860 --> 00:30:54,580
In the real case, they describe the relation between the length of a side of a square and

352
00:30:54,580 --> 00:30:56,620
its area.

353
00:30:56,620 --> 00:31:02,140
In the complex case, geometric transformations are studied.

354
00:31:02,140 --> 00:31:06,340
Squaring means that we apply some transformation twice.

355
00:31:06,340 --> 00:31:11,740
For the square root of a transformation, we ask which another transformation has to be

356
00:31:11,740 --> 00:31:17,140
applied twice to get this original transformation.

357
00:31:17,140 --> 00:31:25,180
All confusion originates from bad mathematical notation such as the square root of minus 1.

358
00:31:25,180 --> 00:31:29,220
There is nothing magical or imaginary about complex numbers.

359
00:31:29,220 --> 00:31:33,380
It is just simple geometry.

360
00:31:33,380 --> 00:31:37,460
I want to conclude this video with a personal story.

361
00:31:37,460 --> 00:31:43,700
During my studies at Charles University in Braque, I was very lucky to meet Zdeniek Hedruin.

362
00:31:43,700 --> 00:31:50,900
He was a Steyrczyk mathematician who studied algebra, category theory and graph theory.

363
00:31:50,900 --> 00:31:58,260
Later in his life, he applied mathematics in various fields such as sociology, psychology,

364
00:31:58,260 --> 00:32:01,300
biology and medicine.

365
00:32:01,300 --> 00:32:06,940
Professor Hedruin spent a tremendous amount of time discussing with me everything from

366
00:32:06,940 --> 00:32:09,740
mathematics to philosophy.

367
00:32:09,740 --> 00:32:15,940
He became de facto my unofficial PhD supervisor and completely changed my life.

368
00:32:15,940 --> 00:32:21,460
I still remember his beautiful description of complex analysis as the study of sinks

369
00:32:21,460 --> 00:32:26,380
and vortexes, which took me several years to unpack.

370
00:32:26,380 --> 00:32:31,180
Each complex function defines a certain flow in the plane.

371
00:32:31,180 --> 00:32:37,660
Access, in the real value at some point, represented by the complex potential, creates

372
00:32:37,660 --> 00:32:39,980
a source.

373
00:32:39,980 --> 00:32:45,700
Imaginary complex potential creates a vortex, and we already know that it is geometrically

374
00:32:45,740 --> 00:32:47,740
a rotation.

375
00:32:47,740 --> 00:32:52,020
In general, some combination of these might happen.

376
00:32:52,020 --> 00:32:56,780
See this interactive complex analysis book.

377
00:32:56,780 --> 00:33:00,660
Zdeniek Hedruin has another connection to this video.

378
00:33:00,660 --> 00:33:07,100
He spent the last 40 years of his life studying brain, how to model it with mathematics and

379
00:33:07,100 --> 00:33:10,860
how to use computers to better understand it.

380
00:33:10,860 --> 00:33:18,260
He died in spring 2018, and shortly before I promised to him that I will turn his idea

381
00:33:18,260 --> 00:33:22,540
into a tool which can help a lot of people.

382
00:33:22,540 --> 00:33:28,660
With my friends, we have spent the last 5 years realizing Hedruin's vision by building

383
00:33:28,660 --> 00:33:32,380
this application called OrgPet.

384
00:33:32,380 --> 00:33:37,420
I want to illustrate the strength of OrgPet on one concrete example.

385
00:33:37,420 --> 00:33:43,660
My wife and I have played the computer game Zero's Escape, Virtus Last Reward.

386
00:33:43,660 --> 00:33:46,980
This game consists of many logic and math puzzles.

387
00:33:46,980 --> 00:33:50,620
In particular, the dice puzzle caught my attention.

388
00:33:50,620 --> 00:33:55,540
In it, one reconfigures several dice by rolling them.

389
00:33:55,540 --> 00:34:02,540
The goal is to place them in the center, while showing the prescribed numbers on top.

390
00:34:02,540 --> 00:34:08,300
As a mathematician, I got interested in the following simplified problem.

391
00:34:08,300 --> 00:34:10,540
Suppose that we have just a single dice.

392
00:34:10,540 --> 00:34:16,340
We want to roll it a few times and finish in the same starting position.

393
00:34:16,340 --> 00:34:21,620
The dice may end up with a different rotation than when it started.

394
00:34:21,620 --> 00:34:26,980
The question is, what are all the possible rotations of the dice I can obtain in this

395
00:34:26,980 --> 00:34:28,780
manner?

396
00:34:28,780 --> 00:34:34,060
From my research, I knew that group theory is the right tool to attack this problem,

397
00:34:34,060 --> 00:34:36,940
but details were not clear to me.

398
00:34:36,940 --> 00:34:42,860
So I sat down in front of OrgPet for about 2 hours and built my understanding of this

399
00:34:42,860 --> 00:34:44,660
problem.

400
00:34:44,660 --> 00:34:49,300
There are 24 rotational symmetries of the dice forming a group.

401
00:34:49,300 --> 00:34:53,100
To see its structure, I have built a calligraph.

402
00:34:53,100 --> 00:34:57,740
Its vertices are these 24 rotational symmetries.

403
00:34:57,740 --> 00:35:04,500
Let arrows rotate the dice to the right, while blue arrows rotate the dice forward.

404
00:35:04,500 --> 00:35:10,980
This graph reveals the beautiful symmetrical structure hidden within the group.

405
00:35:10,980 --> 00:35:17,260
To end up in the same place, necessarily an even number of rotations has to be applied.

406
00:35:17,260 --> 00:35:24,140
Therefore, starting in a pink vertex means that we have to end up in another pink vertex.

407
00:35:24,140 --> 00:35:29,060
So only 12 of these rotations can theoretically be reached.

408
00:35:29,060 --> 00:35:35,700
While playing the game, I was able to generate many rotations by cycling the dice.

409
00:35:35,700 --> 00:35:39,780
Moving it, say left, forward, right, backwards.

410
00:35:39,780 --> 00:35:41,180
But how many?

411
00:35:41,180 --> 00:35:46,820
And what if we introduce some other sequence of four moves, say rotating the dice right,

412
00:35:46,820 --> 00:35:49,140
forward, left, backwards.

413
00:35:49,140 --> 00:35:53,500
I analyze this situation in OrgPet.

414
00:35:53,500 --> 00:35:58,660
When we apply a single of these four move sequences repeatedly, we cycle through three

415
00:35:58,660 --> 00:36:01,780
different rotations of the dice.

416
00:36:01,780 --> 00:36:07,420
But when we apply both of them, all 12 possible rotations can be reached.

417
00:36:07,420 --> 00:36:11,540
The structure is again depicted by a calligraph.

418
00:36:11,540 --> 00:36:16,300
If you are interested in more details, let me know in the comments.

419
00:36:16,300 --> 00:36:21,980
I can make a longer video about this problem and group theory.

420
00:36:21,980 --> 00:36:28,180
This is a general way to build understanding and OrgPet is a great tool for that.

421
00:36:28,180 --> 00:36:33,820
Just throw your unclear ideas there, play with them and you can immediately benefit

422
00:36:33,820 --> 00:36:35,860
from better understanding.

423
00:36:35,860 --> 00:36:42,780
Moreover, since OrgPet is based on Hedereen's 40 years long research of human brain, it

424
00:36:42,780 --> 00:36:48,460
allows one to capture ideas much more faithfully than when writing them down on a piece of

425
00:36:48,460 --> 00:36:51,620
paper or into a book.

426
00:36:51,620 --> 00:36:57,020
Using this, better understanding can be obtained much, much faster.

427
00:36:57,020 --> 00:37:03,460
As a side effect, since you see your ideas playing right in front of you, better understanding

428
00:37:03,460 --> 00:37:06,200
of your own brain is built.

429
00:37:06,200 --> 00:37:12,580
And I would argue that the brain is the single most important tool of one's life.

430
00:37:12,580 --> 00:37:18,820
In summary, OrgPet is a tool for improving understanding of both problems and your brain

431
00:37:18,820 --> 00:37:20,500
itself.

432
00:37:20,500 --> 00:37:25,940
You can experiment with OrgPet at the address orgpet.com.

433
00:37:25,940 --> 00:37:30,580
If you find it helpful, it would be great if you can support our work.

434
00:37:30,580 --> 00:37:36,200
You can save 20% by using the promo code SUM3.

435
00:37:36,200 --> 00:37:37,840
One more thing.

436
00:37:37,840 --> 00:37:44,620
I have mentioned in the beginning that I consider these mathematical jokes rather silly.

437
00:37:44,620 --> 00:37:51,180
As a bonus for watching this video till the end, let me show you two math jokes I find

438
00:37:51,180 --> 00:37:55,620
absolutely amazing.

439
00:37:55,620 --> 00:37:59,420
Do you know why Romans sucked in algebra?

440
00:37:59,420 --> 00:38:02,340
Because X was always 10.

441
00:38:02,340 --> 00:38:06,340
We are counting in the base 10 numbers.

442
00:38:06,340 --> 00:38:09,700
Mayans use the base 20 numeric system.

443
00:38:09,700 --> 00:38:12,100
Do you know why?

444
00:38:12,100 --> 00:38:39,180
Because they did not wear shoes.
