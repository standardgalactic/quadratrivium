00:00.000 --> 00:07.200
Hi, I have a confession to make, I absolutely love complex numbers.

00:07.200 --> 00:12.720
They are one of the most amazing ideas in all of mathematics.

00:12.720 --> 00:18.080
What I despise is mystic and darkness surrounding them.

00:18.080 --> 00:20.480
Look at these silly jokes.

00:20.480 --> 00:27.560
Non-Math people think that mathematicians are crazy and jokes like these only reinforce

00:27.560 --> 00:28.860
that.

00:28.860 --> 00:35.260
It makes me sad, since mathematics is full of the most amazing ideas.

00:35.260 --> 00:39.460
Unfortunately, they remain hidden.

00:39.460 --> 00:44.460
Jokes aside, Veritasil made this video about complex numbers.

00:44.460 --> 00:50.580
While it beautifully explains the history, it also contains some weird statements like

00:50.580 --> 00:52.780
this one.

00:52.780 --> 00:59.260
Only by abandoning math's connection to reality could we discover reality's true nature.

00:59.260 --> 01:01.180
What a nonsense.

01:01.180 --> 01:05.420
I will show you that complex numbers are completely natural.

01:05.420 --> 01:09.820
Moreover, this is known for over 200 years.

01:09.820 --> 01:15.820
The point here is not to trash their ex-work, as I am a huge fan of Veritasium.

01:15.820 --> 01:22.860
It just highlights the amount of confusion and darkness surrounding complex numbers.

01:22.860 --> 01:29.500
We weigh so much potential of countless people by teaching complex numbers as these mysterious

01:29.500 --> 01:31.820
imaginary entities.

01:31.820 --> 01:35.140
This has to stop.

01:35.140 --> 01:39.980
The goal of this video is to demystify complex numbers.

01:39.980 --> 01:46.460
I will fully explain that they describe geometric transformations of the plane.

01:46.460 --> 01:52.380
And we will show that the only source of confusion about square roots of negative numbers is

01:52.380 --> 01:56.620
our bad terminology and notation.

01:56.620 --> 02:00.340
We start with a little bit of historical context.

02:00.340 --> 02:05.780
In high school, I was told that complex numbers were invented to add solutions to the quadratic

02:05.780 --> 02:09.820
formula when real ones do not exist.

02:09.820 --> 02:17.300
This doesn't make any sense, since the well-known graph of parabola does not intersect the x-axis.

02:17.300 --> 02:20.060
So there are no solutions.

02:20.060 --> 02:25.900
Complex numbers were actually discovered while studying cubic polynomials, which always intersect

02:25.900 --> 02:29.260
the x-axis.

02:29.260 --> 02:35.860
The general solution of the cubic equation was first described by Cardano in 1545 in his

02:35.860 --> 02:38.420
book Artis Magna.

02:38.420 --> 02:43.380
In one formula, square roots of negative numbers were encountered.

02:43.380 --> 02:49.100
But they did cancel out in the end and produced a correct real solution.

02:49.100 --> 02:55.900
Cardano himself commented this case by saying s subtl as it is useless.

02:55.900 --> 02:58.460
But it caught the attention of Bombelli.

02:58.460 --> 03:03.860
In his two books on algebra, he performed the first substantial calculations with complex

03:03.860 --> 03:04.860
numbers.

03:05.660 --> 03:12.700
He called the square root of minus 1 nowadays denoted i as the plus of minus.

03:12.700 --> 03:15.820
This is everything I want to say about these equations.

03:15.820 --> 03:20.500
If you want to know more, I recommend the excellent history description in the Veritasium

03:20.500 --> 03:21.500
video.

03:21.500 --> 03:26.540
There is also a discussion with Ribou Van Braun, which explains mathematics behind

03:26.540 --> 03:29.380
cubic and quadratic formulas.

03:29.380 --> 03:36.420
These two videos by Matemaniac and not all wrong show why there is no Quintic formula.

03:36.420 --> 03:40.140
If you want to explore all these extra materials, don't worry.

03:40.140 --> 03:46.380
This presentation is built in the online application ORPAD, of which I am one of the creators.

03:46.380 --> 03:51.300
You can find a link to this presentation in the video description.

03:51.300 --> 03:53.940
Let's go back to complex numbers.

03:53.940 --> 03:59.060
Even after 100 years, they were still viewed with suspicion and disbelief.

03:59.060 --> 04:04.660
The cart associated imaginary numbers with geometric impossibility.

04:04.660 --> 04:10.900
He coined the term imaginary, basically stating that one can invent solutions of an equation,

04:10.900 --> 04:17.380
but it does not mean that these imaginary quantities have any real meaning.

04:17.380 --> 04:22.860
Even the magician Euler called complex numbers impossible while proving many substantial

04:22.860 --> 04:24.380
results.

04:24.380 --> 04:30.820
He also introduced the notation I for the square root of minus 1.

04:30.820 --> 04:37.100
Shortly after, Wessel and Argan first described geometry of complex numbers, but their work

04:37.100 --> 04:38.660
was not widely known.

04:38.660 --> 04:45.460
Only when the prominent mathematician Gauss described this geometry in 1831, people took

04:45.460 --> 04:46.460
notice.

04:46.460 --> 04:52.820
While working on this video, I discovered a great boat by Gauss that accurately reflects

04:52.820 --> 04:59.460
my approach to explaining complex numbers.

04:59.460 --> 05:04.460
If this subject has either to been considered from the wrong viewpoint and thus enveloped

05:04.460 --> 05:09.900
in mystery and surrounded by darkness, it is largely an unsuitable terminology which

05:09.900 --> 05:11.700
should be blamed.

05:11.700 --> 05:19.260
Had plus 1, minus 1 and square root of minus 1, instead of being called positive, negative

05:19.260 --> 05:27.180
and imaginary or worse still impossible unity, being given the name say of direct, inverse

05:27.180 --> 05:33.420
and lateral unity, there would hardly have been any scope for such obscurity.

05:33.420 --> 05:37.940
Wow, I love this so much.

05:37.940 --> 05:43.220
Mathematicians notice Gauss' work, fix their misunderstandings and all mystery of complex

05:43.220 --> 05:44.980
numbers is gone.

05:44.980 --> 05:48.300
Sadly, that's not the case.

05:48.300 --> 05:54.020
The amount of mystic and darkness has only grown.

05:54.020 --> 05:59.220
Traveling back in time to Descartes and Euler, it makes sense that imaginary numbers raised

05:59.220 --> 06:01.700
eyebrows and doubts.

06:01.700 --> 06:08.220
But thanks to Gauss' brilliant insights, we can no longer use ignorance as an excuse.

06:08.220 --> 06:15.860
Yet, even after 200 years, the Gauss' work is still misunderstood and he is furious about

06:15.860 --> 06:16.860
that.

06:16.860 --> 06:19.060
Let's fix it in this video.

06:19.060 --> 06:25.740
With the great power of the internet, you can help by watching, liking and adding some

06:25.740 --> 06:32.220
comments so we can together be the almighty YouTube algorithm.

06:32.220 --> 06:38.500
Please share this video with your family and friends, educate your grandma and explain it

06:38.500 --> 06:42.500
even to your dog.

06:42.500 --> 06:48.220
Let's sidestep the complex numbers for a second and talk about plane geometry.

06:48.220 --> 06:53.540
If you are familiar with vectors, matrices and their geometric meaning, feel free to

06:53.540 --> 06:56.780
skip to the next chapter.

06:56.780 --> 07:03.260
All points of the plane, also called vectors, can be described as pairs of numbers representing

07:03.260 --> 07:07.860
the coordinates on the x and y axis.

07:07.860 --> 07:14.500
Vectors can be added by summing their coordinates, corresponding to adding forces in physics.

07:14.500 --> 07:20.820
And vectors can be scaled by an arbitrary number alpha, making the resulting vector longer

07:20.820 --> 07:22.740
or shorter.

07:22.740 --> 07:28.500
If alpha is negative, the direction of the vector is sweet.

07:28.500 --> 07:32.180
We can apply geometric transformations of the plane.

07:32.180 --> 07:38.220
You are probably familiar with these from computer graphic editors.

07:38.220 --> 07:44.420
The entire plane can be scaled by some factor, which scales all the vectors.

07:44.420 --> 07:50.500
We can also rotate all the vectors around the origin by some angle, and the plane can

07:50.500 --> 07:56.220
be reflected along some line x axis in this example.

07:56.220 --> 08:00.060
All these transformations have one thing in common.

08:00.060 --> 08:05.300
Their pictures display two vectors u and v, and their sum u plus v.

08:05.300 --> 08:12.020
Notice that it doesn't matter whether we first add them and then transform the result,

08:12.020 --> 08:16.900
or whether we add u and v already transformed.

08:16.900 --> 08:20.820
In both situations, we get the same result.

08:20.820 --> 08:27.260
In other words, this equality is always satisfied.

08:27.260 --> 08:34.220
Transforms of the plane which satisfy this equality and also a similar equality for scaling

08:34.220 --> 08:36.340
are called linear.

08:36.340 --> 08:40.580
All previously shown transformations are linear.

08:40.580 --> 08:46.340
By using alpha equals zero, it easily follows that every linear transformation preserves

08:46.340 --> 08:48.140
the origin.

08:48.140 --> 08:54.060
So a notable nonlinear transformation is the translation of the plane by some vector,

08:54.060 --> 08:59.100
which means adding this vector to all vectors in the plane.

08:59.100 --> 09:03.180
Suppose that we have some linear transformation f.

09:03.180 --> 09:09.100
What is the least amount of information we need to know to fully describe it?

09:09.100 --> 09:13.100
It turns out that not that much is needed.

09:13.100 --> 09:22.660
Notice that any vector xy can be expressed as the sum of x times 1 0 with y times 0 1.

09:22.660 --> 09:30.340
By linearity, it follows that the image of xy is fully determined by the images of 1 0

09:30.340 --> 09:32.300
and 0 1.

09:32.300 --> 09:39.740
We know that the image of 1 0 is some vector a b and the image of 0 1 is some other vector

09:39.740 --> 09:41.540
c d.

09:41.540 --> 09:51.140
In total, f is fully described by four numbers a b c d, which are placed in a 2 by 2 table.

09:51.140 --> 09:57.620
The first column represents the image of 1 0, while the second column represents the

09:57.620 --> 09:59.900
image of 0 1.

09:59.900 --> 10:02.940
This table is called a matrix.

10:02.940 --> 10:09.460
Let's see some examples, which will be important later when we describe geometry of complex

10:09.460 --> 10:11.140
numbers.

10:11.140 --> 10:17.060
When every vector of the plane is scaled by some factor r, the vector 1 0 is mapped to

10:17.060 --> 10:21.780
r 0 and 0 1 is mapped to 0 r.

10:21.780 --> 10:29.320
So the resulting matrix is the diagonal matrix with r on the diagonal.

10:29.320 --> 10:35.860
For the 90 degree rotation, the vector 1 0 is mapped to the other vector 0 1, while

10:35.860 --> 10:40.380
0 1 is mapped to minus 1 0.

10:40.380 --> 10:49.340
So the resulting matrix has 0 on the diagonal and plus 1 and minus 1 of the diagonal.

10:49.340 --> 10:54.940
The matrix of an arbitrary rotation is a little bit more involved.

10:54.940 --> 11:03.900
From geometry, 1 0 is rotated to the coordinates cosine phi and sine phi, which are the coordinates

11:03.900 --> 11:08.500
of the point on the unit circle with the angle phi.

11:08.500 --> 11:15.020
The other vector 0 1 is rotated by further 90 degrees to the point, which after some

11:15.020 --> 11:20.600
simplifications has the coordinates minus sine phi and cosine phi.

11:20.600 --> 11:27.140
So the resulting matrix has cosine phi on the diagonal and sine phi and minus sine phi

11:27.140 --> 11:29.140
of the diagonal.

11:29.140 --> 11:36.500
Okay, we know that each linear transformation is represented by some 2 by 2 matrix.

11:36.500 --> 11:37.500
So what?

11:37.500 --> 11:40.460
Who is this information useful?

11:40.460 --> 11:46.380
It would be great to use this matrix to describe the image of an input vector x y.

11:46.380 --> 11:54.260
Recall that the image of x y is a combination of the images of 1 0 and 0 1, which are described

11:54.260 --> 11:57.260
by the columns of the matrix.

11:57.260 --> 12:02.740
So we can just scale the first column by x and scale the second one by y and sum them

12:02.740 --> 12:04.500
together.

12:04.500 --> 12:09.220
This is precisely how matrix vector multiplication works.

12:09.220 --> 12:15.820
So to find the image of x y, we just need to multiply it by the matrix.

12:15.820 --> 12:19.620
Let's apply this knowledge on the 90 degree rotation.

12:19.620 --> 12:25.700
We already know the rotation matrix, so by multiplying x y with it, we get the vector

12:25.700 --> 12:27.860
minus y x.

12:27.860 --> 12:31.660
This is a neat trick I already discovered at high school.

12:31.660 --> 12:37.180
To rotate a plane vector by 90 degrees, we just need to swap the coordinates and switch

12:37.180 --> 12:39.660
the sign of one of them.

12:39.660 --> 12:44.140
This nicely explains the matrix of an arbitrary rotation.

12:44.140 --> 12:49.540
The image of the blue vector is obtained by rotating the image of the red vector by 90

12:49.540 --> 12:50.540
degrees.

12:50.540 --> 12:58.940
The coordinates of cosine phi, sine phi are swapped and the sine of sine phi is switched.

12:58.940 --> 13:01.540
Linear transformations can be chained.

13:01.540 --> 13:07.220
We first map the plane by a linear transformation F and then map the images by another linear

13:07.220 --> 13:13.500
transformation G. The resulting composite transformation is again linear.

13:13.500 --> 13:20.820
It turns out that it is represented by the matrix multiplication B times A.

13:20.820 --> 13:28.380
For example, when we apply the 90 degree rotation twice, it becomes the 180 degree rotation.

13:28.380 --> 13:32.940
We already know the matrix A of the 90 degree rotation.

13:32.940 --> 13:41.500
The matrix of the 180 degree rotation is obtained by multiplying A with A, which is A squared.

13:41.500 --> 13:47.820
Since the 180 degree rotation flips each vector, it is correctly represented by the matrix

13:47.820 --> 13:50.260
A squared.

13:50.260 --> 13:56.460
In summary, we have seen that points of the plane are represented by two coordinate vectors

13:56.580 --> 14:01.700
while their transformations are described with two by two matrices.

14:01.700 --> 14:09.100
Whenever you see a matrix, geometric it corresponds to some linear transformation.

14:09.100 --> 14:15.420
I believe the concept of linear transformations and their matrix representation is the single

14:15.420 --> 14:20.020
most important idea in all of mathematics.

14:20.020 --> 14:26.580
For instance, the derivative of a function satisfies these equalities, so it is a linear

14:26.580 --> 14:28.900
transformation.

14:28.900 --> 14:34.580
If you want to learn more about linear transformations, I recommend this excellent book by Gilbert

14:34.580 --> 14:36.300
Strang.

14:36.300 --> 14:42.420
You can also check out a free Boolean Brown video that uses animation to explain linear

14:42.420 --> 14:44.900
transformations.

14:44.900 --> 14:49.980
I taught linear algebra for several years and have written a few books in check about

14:49.980 --> 14:50.980
it.

14:50.980 --> 14:57.900
Needless to say, it is one of my favorite topics in mathematics.

14:57.900 --> 15:04.260
With the built geometric understanding, we are finally ready to tackle complex numbers.

15:04.260 --> 15:08.340
They actually have two different geometric meanings.

15:08.340 --> 15:13.700
The first meaning states that the complex number A plus B i corresponds to the vector

15:13.700 --> 15:20.780
A B. The fact that all complex numbers form the two-dimensional plane is well known and

15:20.780 --> 15:24.660
it is often called gauss-complex plane.

15:24.660 --> 15:31.220
There is some evidence that this was already known to Euler.

15:31.220 --> 15:34.940
The other geometric meaning is much less known.

15:34.940 --> 15:42.060
The complex number A plus B i corresponds to the 2 by 2 matrix with A on the diagonal

15:42.060 --> 15:45.900
and B and minus B off the diagonal.

15:45.900 --> 15:52.380
At this moment, it is not clear why one should place A and B into a matrix like this, so

15:52.380 --> 15:54.420
consider it a lucky guess.

15:54.420 --> 16:02.260
We will show that it reveals geometry of complex numbers hidden for centuries.

16:02.260 --> 16:08.440
To see that these representations are valid, we have to prove that addition and multiplication

16:08.440 --> 16:14.500
works for them in the same way as for A plus B i.

16:14.500 --> 16:20.300
Complex numbers are added by independently summing the real and imaginary parts.

16:20.300 --> 16:27.580
Similarly, vectors and matrices are added by independently summing their coordinates.

16:27.580 --> 16:33.660
So we get the same complex number having the real part A plus C and the imaginary part

16:33.660 --> 16:41.060
B plus D. Complex numbers are multiplied by multiplying the parentheses where i squared

16:41.060 --> 16:43.740
is equal to minus 1.

16:43.740 --> 16:51.260
By grouping the real and imaginary parts together, we get the real part AC minus BD and the imaginary

16:51.260 --> 16:55.700
part AD plus BC.

16:56.340 --> 17:04.020
Don't have a standard way to multiply them, but we can easily define it in the same way.

17:04.020 --> 17:11.900
Multiplying the matrices representing A plus B i and C plus D i gives AC minus BD on the

17:11.900 --> 17:19.580
diagonal and AD plus BC and minus AD minus BC off the diagonal.

17:19.580 --> 17:25.700
So the resulting 2 by 2 matrix represents the same complex number.

17:25.700 --> 17:30.900
Okay, now we know that these representations are valid.

17:30.900 --> 17:36.820
Each complex number A plus B i corresponds to the matrix with A on the diagonal and B

17:36.820 --> 17:42.060
and minus B off the diagonal.

17:42.060 --> 17:47.300
This matrix represents a geometric transformation, which one?

17:47.300 --> 17:48.860
We know the drill.

17:48.860 --> 17:56.060
The counts of this matrix describe the images of the vectors 1, 0 and 0, 1.

17:56.060 --> 18:03.260
So 1, 0 is mapped to some vector AB, while 0, 1 is mapped to minus BA.

18:03.260 --> 18:09.700
We also know that minus BA is the 90 degree rotation of AB.

18:09.700 --> 18:17.740
Since both 1, 0 and 0, 1 are scaled by the common factor R equal to the length of AB,

18:17.740 --> 18:23.260
one part of the transformation is scaling the plane.

18:23.260 --> 18:30.900
Both 1, 0 and 0, 1 are also rotated by the angle phi, which is the angle of AB.

18:30.900 --> 18:37.220
Therefore, the complex number A plus B i is the geometric transformation, which is the

18:37.220 --> 18:43.540
composition of scaling the plane by the length of AB and rotating the plane by the angle

18:43.540 --> 18:47.540
of AB.

18:47.540 --> 18:52.060
Everything can be called amplification and rotation twists the plane.

18:52.060 --> 18:58.940
Tristan need him, in his excellent book visual complex analysis, coined the beautiful term

18:58.940 --> 19:06.980
ampli-twist to describe the geometric effect of complex multiplication.

19:06.980 --> 19:09.980
Do you recall trigonometric form?

19:09.980 --> 19:16.180
Many people when seeing this, lose all hope to ever understand complex numbers, but it

19:16.180 --> 19:18.980
is not that complicated.

19:18.980 --> 19:25.820
When reformulated to matrices, it states that the matrix on the left with A and B is equal

19:25.820 --> 19:31.380
to the matrix on the right containing sines and cosines.

19:31.380 --> 19:39.700
Our geometric argument already proves that these matrices are the same.

19:39.700 --> 19:45.340
Complex numbers form a very efficient language to describe geometric transformations of the

19:45.340 --> 19:48.780
plane and not just by multiplication.

19:48.780 --> 19:55.500
Addition of a fixed complex number W to the plane corresponds to the translation of the

19:55.500 --> 19:58.620
plane by this vector W.

19:58.620 --> 20:05.540
As we already know, translation is not a linear transformation.

20:05.540 --> 20:10.980
Multiplication by a fixed complex number W is the ampli-twist of the plane, which consists

20:10.980 --> 20:17.860
of scaling the plane by the length of W and rotating it by the angle of W.

20:17.860 --> 20:24.300
In this language, we can describe geometric transformations of a few basic complex values

20:24.300 --> 20:26.300
as follows.

20:26.300 --> 20:33.820
0, represented by the 0 matrix, collapses the entire plane into the origin.

20:33.820 --> 20:41.380
1, represented by the identity matrix, is the identity transformation preserving the

20:41.380 --> 20:43.460
entire plane.

20:43.460 --> 20:53.540
I, represented by the matrix having 1 and minus 1 of the diagonal is the 90-degree rotation.

20:53.540 --> 21:02.580
Minus 1, represented by the matrix having minus 1 on the diagonal is the 180-degree rotation.

21:02.580 --> 21:09.260
And finally minus i, represented by the matrix having minus 1 and 1 of the diagonal is the

21:09.260 --> 21:18.020
270-degree rotation of the plane, or the 90-degree rotation in the opposite direction.

21:18.020 --> 21:24.540
So whenever one sees i in some equation, it can be understood as the 90-degree rotation

21:24.540 --> 21:26.700
in some geometry.

21:26.700 --> 21:32.100
There is nothing mysterious or imaginary about that.

21:32.100 --> 21:39.420
Even the standard complex notation a plus bi can be understood as going a in the real

21:39.420 --> 21:47.580
axis direction and then going b in this direction rotated by 90 degrees, which is the imaginary

21:47.580 --> 21:50.220
axis direction.

21:50.220 --> 21:54.820
But geometry of complex numbers does not end here.

21:54.820 --> 22:01.940
The complex conjugation switches the sign of the imaginary part, so a plus bi is mapped

22:01.940 --> 22:04.900
to a minus bi.

22:04.900 --> 22:11.540
Geometrically, it is the reflection of the plane along the x-axis.

22:11.540 --> 22:17.860
In the language of matrices, it corresponds to the matrix transpose 18.

22:17.860 --> 22:24.180
Similarly, the division by a complex number can be explained geometrically.

22:24.180 --> 22:30.380
More generally, there is a built-in family of Mabuse transformations, which map z to

22:30.380 --> 22:38.660
az plus b divided by cz plus d, where abcd are some fixed complex numbers.

22:38.660 --> 22:44.660
The excellent video below explores geometry of these transformations.

22:44.660 --> 22:51.780
Also chapter 3 of visual complex analysis deals with this topic in detail.

22:51.780 --> 22:57.420
In summary, we have explained two different geometric meanings of complex numbers.

22:57.420 --> 23:03.300
They are points of the plane and they are geometric transformations of the plane, represented

23:03.300 --> 23:05.940
with 2x2 matrices.

23:05.940 --> 23:13.220
They are not numbers, similarly as we do not call matrices as matrix numbers.

23:13.220 --> 23:19.420
Complex numbers form a very efficient language to describe geometric transformations of the

23:19.420 --> 23:22.380
plane and beyond.

23:22.380 --> 23:28.860
It is no wonder that they have found vast applications in all areas of mathematics, physics and

23:28.860 --> 23:31.340
computer science.

23:31.340 --> 23:38.740
Geometry is everywhere and efficient descriptions of it are very useful.

23:38.740 --> 23:45.780
To explain geometry of the square root, let's first discuss the square operation.

23:45.780 --> 23:54.260
In the context of real numbers, we get a square with the site x, whose area is x squared.

23:54.260 --> 23:58.780
This is the reason why the square operation is called square.

23:58.780 --> 24:03.460
Alternatively, we have the well-known graph of the parabola.

24:03.460 --> 24:09.440
For a given value x, its value f of x is equal x squared.

24:09.440 --> 24:15.140
On the other hand, a complex number is an amplitude transformation, so it is some scaling

24:15.140 --> 24:19.340
by r and some rotation by phi.

24:19.340 --> 24:23.980
Squaring this transformation means that it is applied twice.

24:23.980 --> 24:30.500
When we scale twice by r, the total scaling effect is r squared.

24:30.500 --> 24:36.700
And rotating twice by phi is the same as rotating once by 2 phi.

24:36.700 --> 24:45.100
So z squared is the amplitude transformation, scaling by r squared and rotating by 2 phi.

24:45.100 --> 24:52.660
For example, when z is the 90 degree rotation, we have already shown that z squared is the

24:52.660 --> 24:56.860
180 degree rotation.

24:56.860 --> 25:01.940
We get better geometric insight by squaring the entire plane.

25:01.940 --> 25:07.900
Suppose that we smoothly morph the plane by moving each point towards its square.

25:07.900 --> 25:13.740
This motion winds the plane twice around the origin since all angles are doubled.

25:13.740 --> 25:19.420
For instance, the points of the spiral on the left go once around the origin while their

25:19.420 --> 25:22.820
images go twice around.

25:22.820 --> 25:27.680
We can understand this motion better by viewing it in three dimensions.

25:27.680 --> 25:32.940
The complex plane is placed at the bottom and the images of the square transformation

25:32.940 --> 25:35.820
are displayed by the colorful spiral.

25:35.820 --> 25:43.100
We start at the bottom and as we rotate around, the images are placed higher and higher.

25:43.100 --> 25:48.460
Notice that the images form two layers on top of every point of the plane with exception

25:48.460 --> 25:49.460
of the origin.

25:49.460 --> 25:55.940
A point z is squared to the same point as its 180 degree rotation which is equal to

25:55.940 --> 25:58.860
minus z.

25:58.860 --> 26:05.140
This 3D representation of z squared is closely related to the concept of Riemann's surfaces.

26:05.140 --> 26:10.340
See this beautiful video for more visualizations.

26:10.340 --> 26:18.500
As Gauss states, the origin of all this confusion is bad mathematical terminology and notation.

26:18.500 --> 26:25.140
When using the same symbols for concepts of different meaning, it naturally reads to misunderstandings

26:25.140 --> 26:28.020
and ideas are wrongly mixed.

26:28.020 --> 26:34.340
As a freshman at university, I recall my calculus professor describing Coppac's analysis as

26:34.340 --> 26:39.380
being exactly the same as real analysis for a while.

26:39.380 --> 26:44.420
But then one gets all these wild surprising consequences.

26:44.420 --> 26:50.220
It didn't make much sense to him since the same notation was used for ideas of completely

26:50.220 --> 26:53.900
different meaning.

26:53.900 --> 26:56.260
So what about the square root?

26:56.260 --> 26:58.340
We start with the definition.

26:58.340 --> 27:02.620
The square root is the inverse of the square operation.

27:02.620 --> 27:09.660
Therefore, the square root of z is defined as a value w such that w squared is equal

27:09.660 --> 27:11.300
to z.

27:11.300 --> 27:16.220
In case of real geometry, we have a square of known area z.

27:16.220 --> 27:20.620
We ask what is the length of the side of the square.

27:20.620 --> 27:28.460
Since there is no square with negative area, the square root of a negative number is meaningless.

27:28.460 --> 27:35.020
From complex geometry, we know that each complex number z is a geometric transformation.

27:35.020 --> 27:42.660
Its square root is therefore another transformation w which becomes z when it is applied twice.

27:42.660 --> 27:48.180
We just need to find it using geometry of complex numbers.

27:48.180 --> 27:50.940
Let's take a look at a simple example.

27:50.940 --> 27:57.220
We already know that minus one is the 180 degree rotation of the plane.

27:57.220 --> 28:05.140
So we ask which amplitude transformation has to be applied twice to get this rotation.

28:05.140 --> 28:10.340
Since minus one does not scale the plane, the unknown square root does not scale the

28:10.340 --> 28:12.660
plane as well.

28:12.660 --> 28:19.340
It is easy to see that applying either the 90 degree rotation or the minus 90 degree rotation

28:19.340 --> 28:24.260
twice results into the 180 degree rotation.

28:24.260 --> 28:29.980
So the square root of minus one is either i or minus i.

28:29.980 --> 28:35.380
There is nothing magical or imaginary about that.

28:35.380 --> 28:41.860
To understand the square root of an arbitrary complex number z, recall that it is some amplitude

28:41.860 --> 28:47.860
transformation scaling the plane by r and rotating it by phi.

28:47.860 --> 28:55.580
We want to find another amplitude transformation which becomes z when applied twice.

28:55.580 --> 29:02.500
Concerning scaling, this transformation has to be scaled by the square root of r.

29:02.500 --> 29:08.860
When the angle is half of phi, it becomes phi when applied twice.

29:08.860 --> 29:14.340
So the amplitude scaling the plane by the square root of r and rotating it by half of

29:14.340 --> 29:20.820
phi is a valid square root, but there is another one.

29:20.820 --> 29:27.020
W is the square root of z when w squared is equal z.

29:27.020 --> 29:32.540
The opposite point minus w is also squared to z.

29:32.540 --> 29:37.300
It does the same scaling by the square root of r.

29:37.300 --> 29:43.700
The angle of minus w has extra 180 degrees compared to w.

29:43.700 --> 29:51.300
When minus w is applied twice, we get an additional rotation by 360 degrees which is the full

29:51.300 --> 29:53.300
circle.

29:53.300 --> 30:01.860
So the resulting amplitude minus w squared has the same angle as w squared.

30:01.860 --> 30:07.500
We have already observed this behavior when we analyze the effect of the square transformation

30:07.500 --> 30:10.060
in 3D.

30:10.060 --> 30:14.940
Each point of the plane is covered by two layers of the image.

30:14.940 --> 30:21.300
Suppose that we pierce the spiral from top at some point p for which we want to know

30:21.300 --> 30:24.020
the square root.

30:24.020 --> 30:30.060
If we undo the square motion, the spiral unwinds back into the plane.

30:30.060 --> 30:34.820
It is pierced in two different points opposite to each other.

30:34.820 --> 30:39.420
These two points are the square roots of p.

30:39.420 --> 30:45.300
In summary, we have seen that both the square and the square root transformations have different

30:45.300 --> 30:48.860
meanings for real and complex numbers.

30:48.860 --> 30:54.580
In the real case, they describe the relation between the length of a side of a square and

30:54.580 --> 30:56.620
its area.

30:56.620 --> 31:02.140
In the complex case, geometric transformations are studied.

31:02.140 --> 31:06.340
Squaring means that we apply some transformation twice.

31:06.340 --> 31:11.740
For the square root of a transformation, we ask which another transformation has to be

31:11.740 --> 31:17.140
applied twice to get this original transformation.

31:17.140 --> 31:25.180
All confusion originates from bad mathematical notation such as the square root of minus 1.

31:25.180 --> 31:29.220
There is nothing magical or imaginary about complex numbers.

31:29.220 --> 31:33.380
It is just simple geometry.

31:33.380 --> 31:37.460
I want to conclude this video with a personal story.

31:37.460 --> 31:43.700
During my studies at Charles University in Braque, I was very lucky to meet Zdeniek Hedruin.

31:43.700 --> 31:50.900
He was a Steyrczyk mathematician who studied algebra, category theory and graph theory.

31:50.900 --> 31:58.260
Later in his life, he applied mathematics in various fields such as sociology, psychology,

31:58.260 --> 32:01.300
biology and medicine.

32:01.300 --> 32:06.940
Professor Hedruin spent a tremendous amount of time discussing with me everything from

32:06.940 --> 32:09.740
mathematics to philosophy.

32:09.740 --> 32:15.940
He became de facto my unofficial PhD supervisor and completely changed my life.

32:15.940 --> 32:21.460
I still remember his beautiful description of complex analysis as the study of sinks

32:21.460 --> 32:26.380
and vortexes, which took me several years to unpack.

32:26.380 --> 32:31.180
Each complex function defines a certain flow in the plane.

32:31.180 --> 32:37.660
Access, in the real value at some point, represented by the complex potential, creates

32:37.660 --> 32:39.980
a source.

32:39.980 --> 32:45.700
Imaginary complex potential creates a vortex, and we already know that it is geometrically

32:45.740 --> 32:47.740
a rotation.

32:47.740 --> 32:52.020
In general, some combination of these might happen.

32:52.020 --> 32:56.780
See this interactive complex analysis book.

32:56.780 --> 33:00.660
Zdeniek Hedruin has another connection to this video.

33:00.660 --> 33:07.100
He spent the last 40 years of his life studying brain, how to model it with mathematics and

33:07.100 --> 33:10.860
how to use computers to better understand it.

33:10.860 --> 33:18.260
He died in spring 2018, and shortly before I promised to him that I will turn his idea

33:18.260 --> 33:22.540
into a tool which can help a lot of people.

33:22.540 --> 33:28.660
With my friends, we have spent the last 5 years realizing Hedruin's vision by building

33:28.660 --> 33:32.380
this application called OrgPet.

33:32.380 --> 33:37.420
I want to illustrate the strength of OrgPet on one concrete example.

33:37.420 --> 33:43.660
My wife and I have played the computer game Zero's Escape, Virtus Last Reward.

33:43.660 --> 33:46.980
This game consists of many logic and math puzzles.

33:46.980 --> 33:50.620
In particular, the dice puzzle caught my attention.

33:50.620 --> 33:55.540
In it, one reconfigures several dice by rolling them.

33:55.540 --> 34:02.540
The goal is to place them in the center, while showing the prescribed numbers on top.

34:02.540 --> 34:08.300
As a mathematician, I got interested in the following simplified problem.

34:08.300 --> 34:10.540
Suppose that we have just a single dice.

34:10.540 --> 34:16.340
We want to roll it a few times and finish in the same starting position.

34:16.340 --> 34:21.620
The dice may end up with a different rotation than when it started.

34:21.620 --> 34:26.980
The question is, what are all the possible rotations of the dice I can obtain in this

34:26.980 --> 34:28.780
manner?

34:28.780 --> 34:34.060
From my research, I knew that group theory is the right tool to attack this problem,

34:34.060 --> 34:36.940
but details were not clear to me.

34:36.940 --> 34:42.860
So I sat down in front of OrgPet for about 2 hours and built my understanding of this

34:42.860 --> 34:44.660
problem.

34:44.660 --> 34:49.300
There are 24 rotational symmetries of the dice forming a group.

34:49.300 --> 34:53.100
To see its structure, I have built a calligraph.

34:53.100 --> 34:57.740
Its vertices are these 24 rotational symmetries.

34:57.740 --> 35:04.500
Let arrows rotate the dice to the right, while blue arrows rotate the dice forward.

35:04.500 --> 35:10.980
This graph reveals the beautiful symmetrical structure hidden within the group.

35:10.980 --> 35:17.260
To end up in the same place, necessarily an even number of rotations has to be applied.

35:17.260 --> 35:24.140
Therefore, starting in a pink vertex means that we have to end up in another pink vertex.

35:24.140 --> 35:29.060
So only 12 of these rotations can theoretically be reached.

35:29.060 --> 35:35.700
While playing the game, I was able to generate many rotations by cycling the dice.

35:35.700 --> 35:39.780
Moving it, say left, forward, right, backwards.

35:39.780 --> 35:41.180
But how many?

35:41.180 --> 35:46.820
And what if we introduce some other sequence of four moves, say rotating the dice right,

35:46.820 --> 35:49.140
forward, left, backwards.

35:49.140 --> 35:53.500
I analyze this situation in OrgPet.

35:53.500 --> 35:58.660
When we apply a single of these four move sequences repeatedly, we cycle through three

35:58.660 --> 36:01.780
different rotations of the dice.

36:01.780 --> 36:07.420
But when we apply both of them, all 12 possible rotations can be reached.

36:07.420 --> 36:11.540
The structure is again depicted by a calligraph.

36:11.540 --> 36:16.300
If you are interested in more details, let me know in the comments.

36:16.300 --> 36:21.980
I can make a longer video about this problem and group theory.

36:21.980 --> 36:28.180
This is a general way to build understanding and OrgPet is a great tool for that.

36:28.180 --> 36:33.820
Just throw your unclear ideas there, play with them and you can immediately benefit

36:33.820 --> 36:35.860
from better understanding.

36:35.860 --> 36:42.780
Moreover, since OrgPet is based on Hedereen's 40 years long research of human brain, it

36:42.780 --> 36:48.460
allows one to capture ideas much more faithfully than when writing them down on a piece of

36:48.460 --> 36:51.620
paper or into a book.

36:51.620 --> 36:57.020
Using this, better understanding can be obtained much, much faster.

36:57.020 --> 37:03.460
As a side effect, since you see your ideas playing right in front of you, better understanding

37:03.460 --> 37:06.200
of your own brain is built.

37:06.200 --> 37:12.580
And I would argue that the brain is the single most important tool of one's life.

37:12.580 --> 37:18.820
