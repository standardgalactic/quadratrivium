1. The speaker expresses a sense of trepidation among Conservative Party members at their conference, likening it to the atmosphere at a Brexit Party event, highlighting their fear that the right could take over the party.

2. They note the unusual respect Nigel Farage received from media figures during a discussion on Good Morning Britain, treating him as a legitimate political leader, which is striking given he's not even a Conservative member.

3. The speaker suggests that the Conservative Party, particularly its more centrist elements associated with David Cameron and Tony Blair's brand of politics (Blairism), are responsible for the party's current lack of support as evidenced by poll numbers.

4. They propose that Nigel Farage should leverage his organisational experience and administrative apparatus from the Brexit Party to infiltrate and influence the Conservative Party, potentially preparing for a future leadership role within it.

5. Farage, at 59 years old, is still relatively young with the potential to influence British politics significantly, possibly becoming Prime Minister after the next election cycle.

6. The speaker encourages individuals to engage with local Conservative Party meetings and social media to make incremental changes from within, emphasizing that now is the time for action rather than mere speculation or critique.

7. They argue that the right's arguments are currently stronger while the left's are weaker, suggesting that a shift towards conservative policies could address the country's issues more effectively than the current left-wing alternatives.

In summary, the speaker is advocating for a strategic approach to influencing the Conservative Party from within, leveraging the strength of Farage's organisational skills and capitalizing on the perceived weaknesses of the party's centrist elements to ultimately position the Conservatives as a strong, right-leaning force capable of leading the country effectively.
