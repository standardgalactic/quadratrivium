00:00.000 --> 00:05.000
Every few years, I make the mistake of wanting to do some spring cleaning and sell some second-hand goods.

00:05.000 --> 00:09.400
And what's a better place to sell second-hand goods than Facebook Marketplace?

00:09.400 --> 00:17.100
With eBay, you have to deal with shipping and with Craigslist, you have to deal with not getting kidnapped, so Facebook Marketplace, it is.

00:17.100 --> 00:19.500
But the last time I did that, I...

00:19.500 --> 00:27.300
From old lady scammers to obsessive weirdos that made me feel unsafe, to people just straight-up making fun of me.

00:27.300 --> 00:34.600
The amount of times people ask me to call them on Facebook Marketplace is an introvert's worst nightmare.

00:34.600 --> 00:38.100
Do you want the ring light or not? It's 10 bucks.

00:38.100 --> 00:42.300
You don't need to call me. Why do you need to call me?

00:42.300 --> 00:48.500
Ran into old lady scammers and people would not stop wanting to call me to this day.

00:48.500 --> 00:53.300
I don't know why people want to talk on the phone so bad on Facebook Marketplace.

00:53.300 --> 00:55.900
Like, what is that conversation going to be like?

00:55.900 --> 00:57.900
Hi. Hi. Do you want the thing?

00:57.900 --> 00:59.200
Yes. Okay.

00:59.200 --> 01:00.100
Does it work?

01:00.100 --> 01:00.700
Yes.

01:00.700 --> 01:01.600
Can I come now?

01:01.600 --> 01:02.200
Yes.

01:02.200 --> 01:03.300
Okay.

01:03.300 --> 01:05.900
Okay.

01:05.900 --> 01:09.000
This could have been a three-text conversation.

01:09.000 --> 01:09.800
Yes.

01:09.800 --> 01:15.700
There's one interaction I'm still mad about where I was selling this big piece of wooden furniture for $60.

01:15.700 --> 01:21.500
And the lady couldn't find my apartment building in the apartment complex even though I gave her clear instructions,

01:21.500 --> 01:25.700
and then got mad and tried to give me $20 for the thing.

01:25.700 --> 01:27.900
Because she couldn't find my apartment.

01:27.900 --> 01:31.300
But at that point, I had already brought it down to the first floor.

01:31.300 --> 01:33.700
Like, I was outside with it for her.

01:33.700 --> 01:38.100
So I ended up giving it to her for $40 because she kept bullying me in real life.

01:38.100 --> 01:39.700
I'll never forgive you, Dolores.

01:39.700 --> 01:42.300
You caused much delor in my ass.

01:42.300 --> 01:48.300
So Facebook Marketplace itself is its own rabbit hole of a video that you can watch after this if you want.

01:48.300 --> 01:50.700
But I'm here to talk about the rest of Facebook.

01:50.700 --> 01:51.300
Why?

01:51.300 --> 01:54.600
Well, my original intention was to sell stuff on Marketplace.

01:54.600 --> 01:57.200
But where I ended up was somewhere else.

01:57.200 --> 02:01.500
I logged in and started scrolling and saw some of the most absurd shit

02:01.500 --> 02:05.900
that you will never get served on Instagram or TikTok or TwitterX.

02:05.900 --> 02:11.700
On those websites, you get a curated feed that the algorithm feeds you to eat up, yum, yum, yum.

02:11.700 --> 02:15.100
Tasty little treats that the algorithm knows that you like seeing,

02:15.100 --> 02:19.900
or ones that will get your engagement because a lot of the ones on Twitter just like piss you off.

02:19.900 --> 02:22.800
It learns what you think is funny, cute, yummy,

02:22.800 --> 02:25.100
and you get more and more of what you interact with.

02:25.100 --> 02:28.200
On Facebook, since I made one and never touched it,

02:28.200 --> 02:30.900
Facebook has no idea who I am.

02:30.900 --> 02:34.400
So the default feed that they show you is a mess.

02:34.400 --> 02:38.900
Cat Williams leaks video of Tyler Perry's freak off with Kevin Hart.

02:38.900 --> 02:39.900
Video is below.

02:39.900 --> 02:44.800
This was posted by King of Cinema where they just post tabloid-esque news.

02:44.800 --> 02:49.800
They can put any pictures up and do whatever and people believe everything on here.

02:49.800 --> 02:50.400
Wow.

02:50.400 --> 02:53.500
Question what's going to happen to Kevin or anyone else?

02:53.500 --> 02:54.300
I'll wait.

02:54.300 --> 02:55.300
Damn right, Teresa.

02:55.300 --> 02:57.700
Good to see some level-headed individuals on here.

02:57.700 --> 03:01.400
I'm afraid to click on this link like I'm guaranteed to get a virus.

03:01.400 --> 03:05.700
There are plenty of tabloid-type pages that thrive on Facebook these days.

03:05.700 --> 03:09.900
The last time most of us left Facebook, our impression of it was like,

03:09.900 --> 03:15.300
mothers who post questionably aggressive minion memes with the guys of being playful.

03:15.300 --> 03:17.300
But in reality, they're on the edge.

03:17.300 --> 03:20.000
They need to whine and whine if you know what I mean.

03:20.000 --> 03:22.800
Like the personification of...

03:22.800 --> 03:24.600
I love cooking with wine.

03:24.600 --> 03:27.100
Sometimes I even put it in the food.

03:29.900 --> 03:32.300
If I managed to survive the rest of the week,

03:32.300 --> 03:37.800
I would like my straight jacket to be hot pink and my helmet to sparkle.

03:37.800 --> 03:41.000
If stress burned calories, I'd be a supermodel.

03:41.000 --> 03:42.400
Vai faire la sombra.

03:42.400 --> 03:44.200
Merde no sol santa.

03:44.200 --> 03:45.100
What does that mean?

03:45.900 --> 03:56.400
Dear haters, I didn't help but notice that awesome ends with me and ugly starts with you.

03:56.400 --> 04:00.200
Putting down your phone and paying attention to those talking to you,

04:00.200 --> 04:01.600
there's an app for that.

04:01.600 --> 04:03.700
It's called Respect.

04:03.700 --> 04:05.100
My kids don't talk to me anymore.

04:05.100 --> 04:09.100
But now Facebook is still that, but more.

04:09.100 --> 04:12.000
We got Ariana Grande and her ex-husband.

04:12.000 --> 04:13.900
Hashtag boom challenge.

04:13.900 --> 04:19.200
Upon clicking the hashtag, we can decipher exactly what hashtag boom challenge is.

04:19.200 --> 04:22.200
So, so far, we have Ariana Grande and her ex-husband.

04:22.200 --> 04:28.100
We have Sylvester Stallone and his daughter from the page called Teaching English.

04:33.100 --> 04:34.100
Where'd she go?

04:34.100 --> 04:35.800
Don't scare me like that, Sylvester.

04:35.800 --> 04:39.300
And under it, we have this video from the page FastVideos.

04:39.300 --> 04:41.100
Hashtag boom challenge.

04:41.100 --> 04:43.600
Why is he putting boots in the...

04:43.600 --> 04:47.000
Okay, trust the process, trust the process.

04:47.000 --> 04:50.200
Okay, we're wrapping it with string.

04:53.200 --> 04:55.200
Okay, I wonder what he's making.

04:55.200 --> 04:56.800
What is he making?

04:56.800 --> 04:59.000
I mean, this is pretty sick, but like, what is he doing?

05:05.700 --> 05:07.200
I guess we'll never find out.

05:07.200 --> 05:08.600
The video just ends.

05:08.600 --> 05:12.400
First of all, FastVideos feels like false advertising

05:12.400 --> 05:14.600
because that felt like an eternity.

05:14.600 --> 05:16.900
And then I got punished for watching it all.

05:16.900 --> 05:18.600
I want my 60 seconds back.

05:18.600 --> 05:20.200
I still don't know what he was doing.

05:20.200 --> 05:23.400
Part three, hashtag movie, hashtag boom challenge.

05:23.400 --> 05:26.000
This is just a scene from the hit movie.

05:32.600 --> 05:34.400
The Suicide Squad.

05:34.400 --> 05:37.800
Is this person just uploading the entire movie to Facebook

05:37.800 --> 05:41.100
in four by five cropped aspect ratio

05:41.100 --> 05:44.600
with black bars on the top and bottom in parts?

05:44.600 --> 05:48.000
This is like some 2005 YouTube stuff.

05:48.000 --> 05:52.600
Safe to say, I know exactly what the hashtag boom challenge is now.

05:55.100 --> 05:58.700
The rest of my feed was just a lot of Beyonce and her family.

05:58.700 --> 05:59.600
Go blue.

06:01.300 --> 06:03.400
I'm pretty sure she's wearing orange.

06:04.400 --> 06:11.600
We have the most hilarious photo shop of Paul Walker ever.

06:11.600 --> 06:12.200
R.A.P.

06:12.200 --> 06:14.900
But at least we got the Wiz Khalifa song out of it.

06:16.500 --> 06:19.500
So one genre of video that's really popular on Facebook,

06:19.500 --> 06:22.200
or at least was, are the ones where someone is supposed to get

06:22.200 --> 06:25.800
surprised with something like a proposal or a boyfriend back

06:25.800 --> 06:27.400
home from military stuff.

06:27.400 --> 06:31.500
But the video is padded with like 10 minutes of nothing happening

06:31.500 --> 06:34.300
and it's like the worst staged thing ever.

06:34.300 --> 06:36.500
Rolling, action.

06:36.500 --> 06:40.200
Pay no mind to the person yelling, rolling, action

06:40.200 --> 06:42.300
in the beginning of this video and you'll see why.

06:45.000 --> 06:46.100
Ew.

06:46.100 --> 06:47.500
Why was that in your mouth?

06:47.500 --> 06:49.600
So he's going to put it in the strawberry.

06:56.800 --> 07:00.100
No one will ever see him there with that.

07:02.500 --> 07:05.700
So now they're calling the girl over who's going to get proposed

07:05.700 --> 07:09.200
to good thing that they yelled rolling action in the beginning

07:09.200 --> 07:12.200
of this rolling action.

07:12.200 --> 07:12.700
Oh my gosh.

07:12.700 --> 07:13.400
What is this?

07:13.400 --> 07:14.600
Your man.

07:14.600 --> 07:16.600
He sent this over for you.

07:16.600 --> 07:17.400
Oh my God.

07:17.400 --> 07:18.600
It's amazing.

07:20.100 --> 07:21.900
She doesn't know.

07:25.100 --> 07:26.200
Can he breathe?

07:26.200 --> 07:27.300
He's a Madagascar.

07:27.900 --> 07:31.700
She doesn't even see the ring clearly in the strawberry.

07:31.700 --> 07:33.300
How does she not see him?

07:33.300 --> 07:35.100
This is crazy.

07:35.100 --> 07:36.900
I think he's actually here.

07:36.900 --> 07:37.500
Yeah.

07:37.500 --> 07:38.400
I think he's here.

07:38.400 --> 07:39.600
I think he might be here.

07:39.600 --> 07:40.300
I think he might be here.

07:40.300 --> 07:41.300
Oh my God.

07:41.300 --> 07:43.500
She found the ring.

07:43.500 --> 07:45.000
It's a ring.

07:45.000 --> 07:45.900
A ring.

07:45.900 --> 07:49.500
This girl has the observational skills of Dora the Explorer.

07:49.500 --> 07:52.500
It's like part of the reason I stopped watching the show as

07:52.500 --> 07:53.100
an eight-year-old.

07:53.100 --> 07:54.700
It was infuriating.

07:55.100 --> 07:55.700
Look.

07:57.700 --> 07:59.100
What does that say?

07:59.100 --> 08:00.300
Remove the rose.

08:00.300 --> 08:04.700
Remove the rose there because there is a very special surprise.

08:12.900 --> 08:15.600
I mean the acting from the friend there is just top tier.

08:15.600 --> 08:20.200
I mean Navy boyfriend surprises pregnant girlfriend and proposed.

08:20.200 --> 08:22.400
They're like combining everything in this one.

08:22.400 --> 08:24.400
They are expecting a baby.

08:25.200 --> 08:27.800
It's the guy from the last video.

08:27.800 --> 08:30.900
Her boyfriend has been gone for three years.

08:32.600 --> 08:38.600
Now he's taking over the ultrasound and that's definitely plugged in and real.

08:38.600 --> 08:41.700
They about to know the gender of the baby.

08:41.700 --> 08:44.300
He's crying of happiness.

08:44.300 --> 08:49.000
She definitely cannot see him out of the peripherals of her eyes.

08:49.000 --> 08:51.600
I actually have another surprise for you.

08:51.600 --> 08:52.600
What?

08:52.600 --> 08:55.300
So the reason I'm filming is to your left.

08:58.300 --> 08:59.300
No way.

08:59.300 --> 09:00.800
Oh my God.

09:00.800 --> 09:02.400
It's been so long.

09:02.400 --> 09:06.900
It's been so long and I know I've been overseas and we're having a baby girl.

09:06.900 --> 09:11.900
I don't want to spend another day not knowing you know my wife.

09:11.900 --> 09:12.900
Would you marry me?

09:12.900 --> 09:13.700
Of course.

09:13.700 --> 09:14.400
Really?

09:14.400 --> 09:15.800
Yes, of course.

09:16.800 --> 09:18.000
Oh my gosh.

09:18.800 --> 09:20.900
Are we having a baby girl?

09:22.700 --> 09:23.900
Oh my God.

09:28.300 --> 09:29.300
Hold on.

09:29.300 --> 09:32.800
He's been gone for three years and she's pregnant.

09:33.800 --> 09:38.500
That might have been what they were baiting, but it didn't work because the only comment

09:38.500 --> 09:41.600
is congratulations to you and your families.

09:41.600 --> 09:42.400
Thank you, Barb.

09:42.400 --> 09:46.900
When she sees him, military husband surprise homecoming.

09:46.900 --> 09:49.900
This one has 70,000 likes in this one.

09:49.900 --> 09:55.200
He loves doing this thing every like 10 seconds where he shushes us as if we're going to tell her.

10:00.200 --> 10:02.900
Oh, and now he's doing the thing where he takes over.

10:02.900 --> 10:08.700
If someone was just standing there filming me like this for 15 minutes during my appointment,

10:08.700 --> 10:10.200
I would be weirded out.

10:15.000 --> 10:16.700
I was doing the whole thing.

10:17.200 --> 10:18.100
I was doing it.

10:20.600 --> 10:27.600
I'm so glad I waited 15 minutes to watch the last 20 seconds of this video.

10:27.600 --> 10:32.400
Can you imagine if the first like 20 minutes of my videos were just me like setting up

10:32.400 --> 10:34.200
and I just left it all in?

10:50.700 --> 10:52.500
Hey, guys, and welcome to another episode.

10:52.500 --> 10:56.100
The reason they do this instead of just posting the last 10 seconds of the video

10:56.100 --> 11:00.500
is to increase the watch time, which means more ads, which means more money.

11:00.500 --> 11:02.300
They do this on Snapchat too.

11:02.300 --> 11:07.100
This reminds me of that one video I made where they spend 10 minutes burning sprinkles

11:07.100 --> 11:11.800
and eggs in a waffle iron only for it to come out looking like this.

11:11.800 --> 11:15.600
But I want to show you the reason I wanted to make this video because I found the most

11:15.600 --> 11:20.300
insane conglomeration of celebrity tabloid stretching the video out.

11:20.300 --> 11:23.300
The most confusing video I've ever seen.

11:23.300 --> 11:27.300
Zac Efron failed in his latest millionaire project.

11:27.300 --> 11:30.700
Ah, yes, the failed celebrity, Zac Efron.

11:30.700 --> 11:35.600
They basically made up this entire narrative that Zac Efron is devastated

11:35.600 --> 11:39.100
and now his career has plummeted and he's in turmoil.

11:39.100 --> 11:44.000
And today with his intervened face, his career is coming to an end.

11:44.000 --> 11:47.000
The high school musical actor is devastated.

11:47.000 --> 11:52.700
For years, he had to deal with horrible rumors about his swollen face due to bad surgery.

11:52.700 --> 11:56.300
You had to recently dispel rumors that you had undergone plastic surgery.

11:56.300 --> 11:57.800
You actually experienced it.

11:57.800 --> 12:00.600
But the truth was different.

12:00.600 --> 12:06.500
He was found on the floor of his house after a terrible domestic accident.

12:06.500 --> 12:09.600
His jaw was dislocated.

12:09.600 --> 12:12.200
But the public only cared about how he looked.

12:12.200 --> 12:14.800
That's why his new project failed.

12:14.800 --> 12:20.600
His new project failed because he was ugly and the public only cared about that.

12:20.600 --> 12:26.400
As if that wasn't enough, another image of the actor with grotesque muscles went viral.

12:26.400 --> 12:29.200
He became the laughing stock again.

12:29.200 --> 12:31.400
Everyone hates Zac Efron.

12:31.400 --> 12:36.200
But after all the hype surrounding his face, he had to speak up.

12:36.200 --> 12:40.400
After the traumatic accident,

12:40.400 --> 12:44.000
Efron's career declined.

12:44.000 --> 12:51.800
But the trip to Australia to film his failed show wasn't in vain because Zac found a love at a cafe.

12:51.800 --> 12:55.800
He met a 25-year-old waitress who stole his heart.

12:55.800 --> 12:58.100
She was everything he was looking for.

12:58.100 --> 13:02.400
She seemed to be the right one for him.

13:02.400 --> 13:06.600
She was a normal and down-to-earth woman.

13:06.600 --> 13:15.000
But it seems Vanessa had other intentions and would break Efron's heart again.

13:15.000 --> 13:18.300
After 10 months, Vanessa betrayed him.

13:18.300 --> 13:22.400
She was tempted by the fame and Zac lost control.

13:22.400 --> 13:30.200
He kicked her off the set of his series, ending the idyllic romance.

13:30.200 --> 13:34.200
Zac discovered that Valadarys had other intentions.

13:34.200 --> 13:41.900
She was tempted by fame and money and accepted a contract to participate in a controversial reality show.

13:41.900 --> 13:43.500
Why are we talking about her now?

13:43.500 --> 13:48.300
There are more twists and turns in this video than there are on an average road in Massachusetts.

13:48.300 --> 13:52.000
But upon his return, Zac worried his fans again.

13:52.000 --> 13:56.700
New images with a bulked physique put him in the spotlight once again.

13:56.700 --> 14:00.000
But this time, he went overboard at the gym.

14:00.000 --> 14:03.600
And just a few months, he completely transformed.

14:03.600 --> 14:06.400
And looks like a different person.

14:06.400 --> 14:09.800
But this time, it's all due to a new project.

14:09.800 --> 14:10.600
Woo!

14:10.600 --> 14:16.000
Zac plays the wrestler Kevin Von Erich for the movie The Iron Claw.

14:16.000 --> 14:17.300
God, he had me worried there.

14:17.300 --> 14:19.500
That was another big twist twist in this video.

14:19.500 --> 14:20.100
I got worried.

14:20.100 --> 14:22.800
Imagine if someone made this, but it's about your life.

14:22.800 --> 14:26.400
Gabby Bell failed in her latest millionaire project.

14:26.400 --> 14:31.900
And today, with her intervened face, her career is coming to an end.

14:31.900 --> 14:42.000
Because her fans keep saying she looks like Michael Reeves, another YouTuber on youtube.com.

14:42.000 --> 14:46.800
The young star is devastated and shares a birthday with Usher.

14:46.800 --> 14:49.300
Reminds me of these videos that are like,

14:49.300 --> 14:52.000
Mr. Beast is dying very soon.

14:52.000 --> 14:55.000
Mr. Beast has a condition called Crohn's disease.

14:55.000 --> 14:56.700
Mr. Beast could die from this.

14:56.700 --> 15:02.200
I'm so glad I could finally show someone that video because I reference it at least three times a week.

15:02.200 --> 15:06.700
Because there's a response video to that from what might be the same guy.

15:06.700 --> 15:08.800
Mr. Beast is not dying.

15:08.800 --> 15:14.100
A YouTuber just claimed Mr. Beast will pass away soon because he has Crohn's disease.

15:14.100 --> 15:16.800
Mr. Beast is dying very soon.

15:16.800 --> 15:19.800
Mr. Beast has a condition called Crohn's disease.

15:19.800 --> 15:21.500
Mr. Beast could die from this.

15:21.500 --> 15:25.400
Mr. Beast does have this disease, but it's very rarely fatal

15:25.400 --> 15:28.700
and he definitely won't pass away from it anytime soon.

15:28.700 --> 15:32.900
Lying about Mr. Beast dying for views is honestly disgusting.

15:33.700 --> 15:39.100
But before we get into the even wilder stuff I found on Facebook, which is no one's surprise,

15:39.100 --> 15:42.500
you might end up wanting to sign up for the sponsor of today's video, Aura.

15:42.500 --> 15:47.700
Aura is an online privacy tool with a multitude of resources like password manager, VPN,

15:47.700 --> 15:49.600
credit locking, and fraud monitoring.

15:49.600 --> 15:53.400
Just the other day, there was a breach that involved my email on a website

15:53.400 --> 15:56.100
and it notified me and I changed my password immediately.

15:56.100 --> 15:59.800
For those of you that use the same password for everything, this is why you shouldn't.

15:59.800 --> 16:02.800
Don't do that. Use a password manager genuinely.

16:02.800 --> 16:06.700
I was also doing some fun stuff where a company had to soft check my credit report

16:06.700 --> 16:09.700
and even after unlocking it Aura notified me immediately

16:09.700 --> 16:11.800
before it was even approved by the company.

16:11.800 --> 16:14.700
It's a pretty cool tool and I've been using it for a few years now

16:14.700 --> 16:18.000
and I've forced my entire family to be on the family plan and it's great.

16:18.000 --> 16:20.600
If you're interested, you can get two weeks for free using my link.

16:20.600 --> 16:24.300
It's aura.com slash Gabby Bell or you can scan the QR code on the screen

16:24.300 --> 16:26.100
or the link is in the description below.

16:26.100 --> 16:27.300
Thanks to Aura for sponsoring.

16:27.300 --> 16:30.200
Checking out the sponsor really helps the channel and be safe out there

16:30.200 --> 16:34.500
because especially on Facebook because this is about to get wild.

16:34.500 --> 16:38.100
Now, that was just my initial scroll as I was laying on the ground

16:38.100 --> 16:42.200
procrastinating my plunge into the toilet of Facebook Marketplace.

16:42.200 --> 16:46.000
But upon spending the most time on Facebook that I have since 2016,

16:46.000 --> 16:49.100
I thought joining a bunch of mom groups would be hilarious

16:49.100 --> 16:52.000
to see whatever shenanigans they were talking about in there.

16:52.000 --> 16:56.700
But instead, I logged on later to continue my rediscovery of making Facebook

16:56.700 --> 17:00.900
part of my daily routine and the first thing I was assaulted with

17:00.900 --> 17:05.900
was a carousel of the most disgusting pictures of a child's foot

17:05.900 --> 17:12.700
with a giant piece of foot crust in the shape and color of a Pringle peeled off his foot.

17:12.700 --> 17:15.900
No sensor warning, no slash spoiler.

17:15.900 --> 17:21.100
Even Instagram, also a meta company has built a feature that it will blur images

17:21.100 --> 17:22.600
it thinks are explicit.

17:22.600 --> 17:25.900
But this was an uncensored attack on my eyes.

17:25.900 --> 17:29.500
I didn't even think to look at the comments because I just immediately left the group.

17:29.500 --> 17:31.400
I saw one image and left.

17:33.500 --> 17:39.000
So I gave up on that idea and I started scrolling through the popular public group suggestions

17:39.000 --> 17:44.300
and found groups like chickens, chickens, chickens, which contained photos of chickens and eggs.

17:44.300 --> 17:45.000
8 out of 10.

17:45.000 --> 17:47.200
I'm high and this is Sardu Valley.

17:47.200 --> 17:49.800
5 out of 10 cute posts but not enough drama.

17:49.800 --> 17:54.200
There's also frog posting a Facebook group where you post frog content.

17:54.200 --> 17:55.200
I got what I came for.

17:55.200 --> 17:55.800
9 out of 10.

17:55.800 --> 17:58.700
Plunging into the depths of Facebook group hell,

17:58.700 --> 18:02.000
I came to this conclusion about young people who still use Facebook.

18:02.000 --> 18:06.200
I know everyone was wondering this and I'm here to dispel the rumors and give you the facts.

18:06.200 --> 18:10.700
It feels like there are four types of people under 30 who still use Facebook actively.

18:10.700 --> 18:13.400
And it's either to cross post your LinkedIn posts,

18:13.400 --> 18:16.300
you're using it ironically and are in shit posting groups,

18:16.300 --> 18:18.300
you're an edge lord from 2016,

18:18.300 --> 18:20.500
or you're in frog spotting.

18:20.500 --> 18:23.800
Isn't that just all social media now?

18:23.800 --> 18:25.700
Like it's all like that.

18:25.700 --> 18:28.500
It hasn't changed.

18:28.500 --> 18:30.500
Baddies in relationships.

18:30.500 --> 18:34.700
Boyfriend texting married female coworker after working hours.

18:34.700 --> 18:35.200
Thoughts?

18:35.200 --> 18:37.100
He talks a lot about female coworker.

18:37.100 --> 18:39.000
Her name comes up several times per week.

18:39.000 --> 18:41.600
They've gone on a work trip together alone.

18:41.600 --> 18:44.700
Last weekend he suddenly wanted to go for a local day trip

18:44.700 --> 18:46.700
and the car read aloud a text from her

18:46.700 --> 18:49.500
that she was coincidentally at the same location

18:49.500 --> 18:51.400
like they were discussing it over text.

18:51.400 --> 18:53.700
He mentioned her several times while we were out.

18:53.700 --> 18:57.000
Altogether gave me the impression since he talks about her frequently,

18:57.000 --> 18:58.100
he thinks of her a lot.

18:58.100 --> 18:59.800
Perhaps I think too much into things.

18:59.800 --> 19:00.400
Thoughts?

19:00.400 --> 19:03.500
And a group expert gives the great advice of

19:03.500 --> 19:05.200
go through that phone.

19:05.200 --> 19:06.400
Oh my god.

19:06.400 --> 19:09.600
Listen, I support women's rights and women's wrongs,

19:09.600 --> 19:10.200
but I...

19:10.200 --> 19:11.300
This one's a bit far.

19:11.300 --> 19:13.400
10 out of 10, this group brought the drama.

19:13.400 --> 19:15.300
Quotes and healing prayers.

19:15.300 --> 19:18.200
Your bank account is just about to overflow.

19:18.200 --> 19:18.900
Put okay.

19:18.900 --> 19:19.700
Amen.

19:19.700 --> 19:22.000
You people cannot follow directions.

19:22.000 --> 19:24.600
And right when I was about to close the book on this saga,

19:24.600 --> 19:27.700
you literally cannot be on Facebook for more than a couple hours

19:27.700 --> 19:30.600
if you're lucky without running into a scam.

19:31.600 --> 19:35.400
On another post in this group, a reply to Amen was,

19:35.400 --> 19:37.400
Send a friend request to Mrs. Angel.

19:37.400 --> 19:38.300
She will help you.

19:38.300 --> 19:42.600
I am building my own house and I also have groceries through her company.

19:42.600 --> 19:44.400
She is legit and trustworthy.

19:44.400 --> 19:45.300
Click on her name.

19:45.300 --> 19:50.900
And in the URL, there's Bitcoin and it's to someone named Angle and not Angel.

19:50.900 --> 19:54.400
And this is definitely them in the profile picture and not fake at all.

19:54.400 --> 19:57.900
Their header kind of tells us everything we need to know about what they do,

19:57.900 --> 19:59.700
except is this a thumb?

19:59.700 --> 20:02.000
How does that even happen on this type of image?

20:02.000 --> 20:06.900
We guarantee you the best trade strategies in business trade wisely

20:06.900 --> 20:09.300
and gain financial freedom.

20:09.300 --> 20:14.200
Bitcoin mining eight years years of University of San Diego.

20:14.200 --> 20:18.100
I majored in Bitcoin mining for eight years years.

20:18.100 --> 20:18.400
Yeah.

20:18.400 --> 20:23.700
And I did my master's in hacking class logistics of University of San Diego.

20:23.700 --> 20:27.400
This scammer in particular will Photoshop posts like this one

20:27.400 --> 20:30.700
where they're pretending to be a satisfied investment client

20:30.700 --> 20:35.100
where they basically runescape scam you by promising to double your Bitcoin or money

20:35.100 --> 20:38.400
and then tricking you in some way or just straight up stealing your money.

20:38.400 --> 20:42.500
But this person obviously got a new car and store so we should be happy for them.

20:42.500 --> 20:46.800
Like the 99 bot comments congratulating them in the exact same way.

20:46.800 --> 20:52.000
I wanted to see if these bodied accounts were fake accounts or hacked ones of victims

20:52.000 --> 20:54.600
and everything just keeps getting weirder.

20:54.600 --> 20:56.900
I guess I shouldn't be surprised because it's Facebook,

20:56.900 --> 21:02.200
but every bot account I clicked on were from Lubbock, Texas, liked religious posts

21:02.200 --> 21:05.200
and have posted a photo of themselves in the last month

21:05.200 --> 21:07.200
and it's the first thing on their profile.

21:07.200 --> 21:11.600
Now either the city of Lubbock has a really active crypto investment community

21:11.600 --> 21:16.100
or these are hundreds if not thousands of fake profiles with the same parameters

21:16.100 --> 21:19.100
which is ironic considering Facebook blocks real accounts

21:19.100 --> 21:22.600
and asks for your physical government ID for you to log back in.

21:22.600 --> 21:25.700
Yet their detection let's fake accounts flood the site.

21:25.700 --> 21:28.800
There was this really popular type of scam comment that I saw

21:28.800 --> 21:32.200
that reads very much like a genuine message up until the end

21:32.200 --> 21:36.500
and it's usually like a woman in distress about her husband potentially cheating

21:36.500 --> 21:41.300
and so she hires a hacker to reveal all his emails, Facebook and Instagram chats,

21:41.300 --> 21:45.600
real-time call listening and his long-deleted messages.

21:45.600 --> 21:48.900
My god, these hackers have more technology than Nicholas Cage did

21:48.900 --> 21:51.000
to steal the Declaration of Independence.

21:51.000 --> 21:53.600
But they'll refer the hacker's username at the end

21:53.600 --> 21:57.900
to recommend to other vulnerable women in some potentially bad relationships.

21:57.900 --> 22:02.300
They must target religious groups in particular because of the trust that's there.

22:02.300 --> 22:04.900
Like, oh, this person is clearly an honest Christian,

22:04.900 --> 22:07.100
like it's less likely that it will be a scam.

22:07.100 --> 22:10.000
Plus, the demographic of people in religious Facebook groups

22:10.000 --> 22:13.900
tend to be a bit older and a bit more easily tricked and fooled by this stuff

22:13.900 --> 22:15.500
that's pretending to be genuine.

22:15.500 --> 22:18.400
And like I said in my last video about Facebook Marketplace,

22:18.400 --> 22:21.900
Facebook loves to let these scammers run rampant on their platform

22:21.900 --> 22:23.300
without doing anything about it.

22:23.300 --> 22:27.100
Last time I reported a scammer and they said we reviewed your report.

22:27.100 --> 22:29.200
We concluded, nah.

22:29.200 --> 22:32.100
They basically forced the users to self-moderate.

22:32.100 --> 22:34.200
I noticed with a ton of the groups I joined,

22:34.200 --> 22:39.200
I had to answer manual capture questions to make sure I was a real person

22:39.200 --> 22:43.300
because the one public group I went in with no moderation was terrible.

22:43.300 --> 22:45.800
There were the same videos posted over and over

22:45.800 --> 22:49.000
that had nothing to do with Star Wars Endor Bush posting,

22:49.000 --> 22:51.400
promoting 18-plus pages,

22:53.000 --> 22:56.400
which is not allowed on Facebook, I just looked it up.

22:56.400 --> 23:00.200
Facebook is a massive platform that spans across the globe

23:00.200 --> 23:03.000
and makes it difficult to perfectly moderate.

23:03.000 --> 23:07.200
But some of this stuff is like, dude, what's going on over there at Facebook HQ?

23:07.200 --> 23:10.900
Among the groups and scams, this video will now come full circle

23:10.900 --> 23:14.700
because the other 80% of Facebook groups that were recommended to me

23:14.700 --> 23:18.800
were flooded with Timu and Xi'en support groups.

23:18.800 --> 23:20.300
I joined all the ones I saw.

23:20.300 --> 23:22.000
Now what the hell are these?

23:26.800 --> 23:28.300
I paused for a moment there

23:28.300 --> 23:32.500
and went down the most insane rabbit hole once again.

23:32.500 --> 23:36.400
These pages are full of posts from real people from what I've gathered,

23:36.400 --> 23:41.600
asking to accept some sort of Timu invite for them to get a free gift.

23:41.600 --> 23:46.100
And I kept seeing like farmland or fish land everywhere on it.

23:46.100 --> 23:50.900
And what it is, is these people are playing a game in the Timu app.

23:57.100 --> 24:01.300
It's a farming sim that allows you to quote-unquote earn coupons

24:01.300 --> 24:03.700
and free gifts upon playing their game.

24:03.700 --> 24:06.600
How could Timu possibly benefit from this?

24:06.600 --> 24:10.400
Well, to water the plants and earn money, you need water

24:10.400 --> 24:14.700
and they give you almost enough water to earn all their free gifts

24:14.700 --> 24:17.300
before they start making it more difficult.

24:17.300 --> 24:20.200
They ask you to invite friends to get more water

24:20.200 --> 24:24.700
or just browse the items for 60 seconds to earn more water.

24:24.700 --> 24:30.900
And they ask you several times to spend $20 on Timu to get more water.

24:30.900 --> 24:34.600
Those are like special tasks that earn you more in the game.

24:34.600 --> 24:36.900
They ask you to turn notifications on

24:36.900 --> 24:40.600
to remember to come back to claim more water from this loot box

24:40.600 --> 24:43.600
and then invite more friends to get some water from that.

24:43.600 --> 24:47.000
It's all purposefully to make shopping on Timu addictive

24:47.000 --> 24:50.000
by forming the shopping experience around a game

24:50.000 --> 24:52.900
all while you're recruiting new users for them.

24:52.900 --> 24:53.700
Wow.

24:53.700 --> 24:56.700
Plus these $30, $40 coupons they give you

24:56.700 --> 25:00.600
are just on orders over $100 that they put in small tax.

25:00.600 --> 25:04.500
There was another link in one of these groups that said I could get seven free items

25:04.500 --> 25:07.900
and I picked out 10 really amazing items on here

25:07.900 --> 25:12.700
and I only had to pay for the last three items which was around $40.

25:12.700 --> 25:16.500
Also the insanity of claiming these items are way more expensive

25:16.500 --> 25:18.700
than they really are on Timu's website.

25:18.700 --> 25:20.100
It's just egregious.

25:20.100 --> 25:23.300
It makes you feel like you're getting a great discount and a great deal

25:23.300 --> 25:26.200
but you're really spending money that you otherwise wouldn't have

25:26.200 --> 25:28.600
because you got sucked in with the seven free items

25:28.600 --> 25:30.200
and now you're spending 40 bucks.

25:30.200 --> 25:34.000
So these Facebook groups are built solely around accepting invites

25:34.000 --> 25:35.100
to get discounts.

25:35.100 --> 25:37.800
They even do trades for she and gifts too

25:37.800 --> 25:40.500
because it seems like they have some sort of game as well.

25:40.500 --> 25:41.700
I'm not sure how that one works

25:41.700 --> 25:45.700
because that is a huge rabbit hole for an entirely different video.

25:50.800 --> 25:55.500
It feels like Facebook emerged during this Wild West era of the internet.

25:55.500 --> 25:58.700
Then it buttoned up early on in its career as a social media

25:58.700 --> 26:02.600
and quickly devolved back into the Wild West of the internet here.

26:02.600 --> 26:06.700
You have to engage your ancient internet instincts while you're on Facebook

26:06.700 --> 26:08.700
because there's a scam at every corner.

26:08.700 --> 26:12.300
Anyway, thanks for tuning into this episode of me eventually finding a scam

26:12.300 --> 26:13.500
and everything I look into.

26:13.500 --> 26:15.000
I feel like a scam magnet.

26:15.000 --> 26:19.500
I suppose this isn't exactly what is the traditional sense of the word scam

26:19.500 --> 26:22.800
but it sure is scummy tactics to get people to spend more money.

26:22.800 --> 26:26.600
But I mean that's everything like casinos and stuff like it.

26:26.600 --> 26:27.600
Everything is shit.

26:27.600 --> 26:31.900
I am usually a positive person and try to find the positive in most things

26:31.900 --> 26:33.400
but man, this sucks.

26:33.400 --> 26:36.200
And I really wrote this sucks

26:36.200 --> 26:38.700
and then I turned off my computer and went to bed.

26:40.700 --> 26:43.500
I did not write a positive outro at all.

26:43.500 --> 26:46.300
Anyway, send this to a parent who loves to click on fishing links

26:46.300 --> 26:48.100
and make sure that they don't.

26:49.100 --> 26:50.000
All right, that's it.

26:50.000 --> 26:50.900
Bye.

27:01.900 --> 27:03.900
What?
