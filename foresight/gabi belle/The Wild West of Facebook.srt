1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Every few years, I make the mistake of wanting to do some spring cleaning and sell some second-hand goods.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:09,400
And what's a better place to sell second-hand goods than Facebook Marketplace?

3
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:17,100
With eBay, you have to deal with shipping and with Craigslist, you have to deal with not getting kidnapped, so Facebook Marketplace, it is.

4
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:19,500
But the last time I did that, I...

5
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:27,300
From old lady scammers to obsessive weirdos that made me feel unsafe, to people just straight-up making fun of me.

6
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:34,600
The amount of times people ask me to call them on Facebook Marketplace is an introvert's worst nightmare.

7
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:38,100
Do you want the ring light or not? It's 10 bucks.

8
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:42,300
You don't need to call me. Why do you need to call me?

9
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:48,500
Ran into old lady scammers and people would not stop wanting to call me to this day.

10
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:53,300
I don't know why people want to talk on the phone so bad on Facebook Marketplace.

11
00:00:53,300 --> 00:00:55,900
Like, what is that conversation going to be like?

12
00:00:55,900 --> 00:00:57,900
Hi. Hi. Do you want the thing?

13
00:00:57,900 --> 00:00:59,200
Yes. Okay.

14
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:00,100
Does it work?

15
00:01:00,100 --> 00:01:00,700
Yes.

16
00:01:00,700 --> 00:01:01,600
Can I come now?

17
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:02,200
Yes.

18
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:03,300
Okay.

19
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:05,900
Okay.

20
00:01:05,900 --> 00:01:09,000
This could have been a three-text conversation.

21
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:09,800
Yes.

22
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:15,700
There's one interaction I'm still mad about where I was selling this big piece of wooden furniture for $60.

23
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:21,500
And the lady couldn't find my apartment building in the apartment complex even though I gave her clear instructions,

24
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:25,700
and then got mad and tried to give me $20 for the thing.

25
00:01:25,700 --> 00:01:27,900
Because she couldn't find my apartment.

26
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:31,300
But at that point, I had already brought it down to the first floor.

27
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:33,700
Like, I was outside with it for her.

28
00:01:33,700 --> 00:01:38,100
So I ended up giving it to her for $40 because she kept bullying me in real life.

29
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:39,700
I'll never forgive you, Dolores.

30
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:42,300
You caused much delor in my ass.

31
00:01:42,300 --> 00:01:48,300
So Facebook Marketplace itself is its own rabbit hole of a video that you can watch after this if you want.

32
00:01:48,300 --> 00:01:50,700
But I'm here to talk about the rest of Facebook.

33
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:51,300
Why?

34
00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:54,600
Well, my original intention was to sell stuff on Marketplace.

35
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:57,200
But where I ended up was somewhere else.

36
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:01,500
I logged in and started scrolling and saw some of the most absurd shit

37
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:05,900
that you will never get served on Instagram or TikTok or TwitterX.

38
00:02:05,900 --> 00:02:11,700
On those websites, you get a curated feed that the algorithm feeds you to eat up, yum, yum, yum.

39
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:15,100
Tasty little treats that the algorithm knows that you like seeing,

40
00:02:15,100 --> 00:02:19,900
or ones that will get your engagement because a lot of the ones on Twitter just like piss you off.

41
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:22,800
It learns what you think is funny, cute, yummy,

42
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:25,100
and you get more and more of what you interact with.

43
00:02:25,100 --> 00:02:28,200
On Facebook, since I made one and never touched it,

44
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:30,900
Facebook has no idea who I am.

45
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:34,400
So the default feed that they show you is a mess.

46
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:38,900
Cat Williams leaks video of Tyler Perry's freak off with Kevin Hart.

47
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:39,900
Video is below.

48
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:44,800
This was posted by King of Cinema where they just post tabloid-esque news.

49
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:49,800
They can put any pictures up and do whatever and people believe everything on here.

50
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:50,400
Wow.

51
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:53,500
Question what's going to happen to Kevin or anyone else?

52
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:54,300
I'll wait.

53
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:55,300
Damn right, Teresa.

54
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:57,700
Good to see some level-headed individuals on here.

55
00:02:57,700 --> 00:03:01,400
I'm afraid to click on this link like I'm guaranteed to get a virus.

56
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:05,700
There are plenty of tabloid-type pages that thrive on Facebook these days.

57
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:09,900
The last time most of us left Facebook, our impression of it was like,

58
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:15,300
mothers who post questionably aggressive minion memes with the guys of being playful.

59
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:17,300
But in reality, they're on the edge.

60
00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:20,000
They need to whine and whine if you know what I mean.

61
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,800
Like the personification of...

62
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:24,600
I love cooking with wine.

63
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:27,100
Sometimes I even put it in the food.

64
00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:32,300
If I managed to survive the rest of the week,

65
00:03:32,300 --> 00:03:37,800
I would like my straight jacket to be hot pink and my helmet to sparkle.

66
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:41,000
If stress burned calories, I'd be a supermodel.

67
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,400
Vai faire la sombra.

68
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:44,200
Merde no sol santa.

69
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:45,100
What does that mean?

70
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:56,400
Dear haters, I didn't help but notice that awesome ends with me and ugly starts with you.

71
00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:00,200
Putting down your phone and paying attention to those talking to you,

72
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:01,600
there's an app for that.

73
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:03,700
It's called Respect.

74
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:05,100
My kids don't talk to me anymore.

75
00:04:05,100 --> 00:04:09,100
But now Facebook is still that, but more.

76
00:04:09,100 --> 00:04:12,000
We got Ariana Grande and her ex-husband.

77
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,900
Hashtag boom challenge.

78
00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:19,200
Upon clicking the hashtag, we can decipher exactly what hashtag boom challenge is.

79
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:22,200
So, so far, we have Ariana Grande and her ex-husband.

80
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:28,100
We have Sylvester Stallone and his daughter from the page called Teaching English.

81
00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:34,100
Where'd she go?

82
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:35,800
Don't scare me like that, Sylvester.

83
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:39,300
And under it, we have this video from the page FastVideos.

84
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:41,100
Hashtag boom challenge.

85
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:43,600
Why is he putting boots in the...

86
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:47,000
Okay, trust the process, trust the process.

87
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,200
Okay, we're wrapping it with string.

88
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:55,200
Okay, I wonder what he's making.

89
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:56,800
What is he making?

90
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:59,000
I mean, this is pretty sick, but like, what is he doing?

91
00:05:05,700 --> 00:05:07,200
I guess we'll never find out.

92
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:08,600
The video just ends.

93
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:12,400
First of all, FastVideos feels like false advertising

94
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:14,600
because that felt like an eternity.

95
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:16,900
And then I got punished for watching it all.

96
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:18,600
I want my 60 seconds back.

97
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:20,200
I still don't know what he was doing.

98
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:23,400
Part three, hashtag movie, hashtag boom challenge.

99
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:26,000
This is just a scene from the hit movie.

100
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:34,400
The Suicide Squad.

101
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:37,800
Is this person just uploading the entire movie to Facebook

102
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:41,100
in four by five cropped aspect ratio

103
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:44,600
with black bars on the top and bottom in parts?

104
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:48,000
This is like some 2005 YouTube stuff.

105
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:52,600
Safe to say, I know exactly what the hashtag boom challenge is now.

106
00:05:55,100 --> 00:05:58,700
The rest of my feed was just a lot of Beyonce and her family.

107
00:05:58,700 --> 00:05:59,600
Go blue.

108
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:03,400
I'm pretty sure she's wearing orange.

109
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:11,600
We have the most hilarious photo shop of Paul Walker ever.

110
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:12,200
R.A.P.

111
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:14,900
But at least we got the Wiz Khalifa song out of it.

112
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:19,500
So one genre of video that's really popular on Facebook,

113
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:22,200
or at least was, are the ones where someone is supposed to get

114
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:25,800
surprised with something like a proposal or a boyfriend back

115
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:27,400
home from military stuff.

116
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:31,500
But the video is padded with like 10 minutes of nothing happening

117
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:34,300
and it's like the worst staged thing ever.

118
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:36,500
Rolling, action.

119
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:40,200
Pay no mind to the person yelling, rolling, action

120
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:42,300
in the beginning of this video and you'll see why.

121
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,100
Ew.

122
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:47,500
Why was that in your mouth?

123
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:49,600
So he's going to put it in the strawberry.

124
00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:00,100
No one will ever see him there with that.

125
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:05,700
So now they're calling the girl over who's going to get proposed

126
00:07:05,700 --> 00:07:09,200
to good thing that they yelled rolling action in the beginning

127
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:12,200
of this rolling action.

128
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:12,700
Oh my gosh.

129
00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:13,400
What is this?

130
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:14,600
Your man.

131
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:16,600
He sent this over for you.

132
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:17,400
Oh my God.

133
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:18,600
It's amazing.

134
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:21,900
She doesn't know.

135
00:07:25,100 --> 00:07:26,200
Can he breathe?

136
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:27,300
He's a Madagascar.

137
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:31,700
She doesn't even see the ring clearly in the strawberry.

138
00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:33,300
How does she not see him?

139
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:35,100
This is crazy.

140
00:07:35,100 --> 00:07:36,900
I think he's actually here.

141
00:07:36,900 --> 00:07:37,500
Yeah.

142
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:38,400
I think he's here.

143
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:39,600
I think he might be here.

144
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:40,300
I think he might be here.

145
00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:41,300
Oh my God.

146
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:43,500
She found the ring.

147
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:45,000
It's a ring.

148
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:45,900
A ring.

149
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:49,500
This girl has the observational skills of Dora the Explorer.

150
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:52,500
It's like part of the reason I stopped watching the show as

151
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:53,100
an eight-year-old.

152
00:07:53,100 --> 00:07:54,700
It was infuriating.

153
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:55,700
Look.

154
00:07:57,700 --> 00:07:59,100
What does that say?

155
00:07:59,100 --> 00:08:00,300
Remove the rose.

156
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:04,700
Remove the rose there because there is a very special surprise.

157
00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:15,600
I mean the acting from the friend there is just top tier.

158
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:20,200
I mean Navy boyfriend surprises pregnant girlfriend and proposed.

159
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:22,400
They're like combining everything in this one.

160
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:24,400
They are expecting a baby.

161
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:27,800
It's the guy from the last video.

162
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:30,900
Her boyfriend has been gone for three years.

163
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:38,600
Now he's taking over the ultrasound and that's definitely plugged in and real.

164
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:41,700
They about to know the gender of the baby.

165
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:44,300
He's crying of happiness.

166
00:08:44,300 --> 00:08:49,000
She definitely cannot see him out of the peripherals of her eyes.

167
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,600
I actually have another surprise for you.

168
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:52,600
What?

169
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:55,300
So the reason I'm filming is to your left.

170
00:08:58,300 --> 00:08:59,300
No way.

171
00:08:59,300 --> 00:09:00,800
Oh my God.

172
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:02,400
It's been so long.

173
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:06,900
It's been so long and I know I've been overseas and we're having a baby girl.

174
00:09:06,900 --> 00:09:11,900
I don't want to spend another day not knowing you know my wife.

175
00:09:11,900 --> 00:09:12,900
Would you marry me?

176
00:09:12,900 --> 00:09:13,700
Of course.

177
00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:14,400
Really?

178
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:15,800
Yes, of course.

179
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:18,000
Oh my gosh.

180
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:20,900
Are we having a baby girl?

181
00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:23,900
Oh my God.

182
00:09:28,300 --> 00:09:29,300
Hold on.

183
00:09:29,300 --> 00:09:32,800
He's been gone for three years and she's pregnant.

184
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:38,500
That might have been what they were baiting, but it didn't work because the only comment

185
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:41,600
is congratulations to you and your families.

186
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:42,400
Thank you, Barb.

187
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:46,900
When she sees him, military husband surprise homecoming.

188
00:09:46,900 --> 00:09:49,900
This one has 70,000 likes in this one.

189
00:09:49,900 --> 00:09:55,200
He loves doing this thing every like 10 seconds where he shushes us as if we're going to tell her.

190
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:02,900
Oh, and now he's doing the thing where he takes over.

191
00:10:02,900 --> 00:10:08,700
If someone was just standing there filming me like this for 15 minutes during my appointment,

192
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:10,200
I would be weirded out.

193
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,700
I was doing the whole thing.

194
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:18,100
I was doing it.

195
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:27,600
I'm so glad I waited 15 minutes to watch the last 20 seconds of this video.

196
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:32,400
Can you imagine if the first like 20 minutes of my videos were just me like setting up

197
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:34,200
and I just left it all in?

198
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:52,500
Hey, guys, and welcome to another episode.

199
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:56,100
The reason they do this instead of just posting the last 10 seconds of the video

200
00:10:56,100 --> 00:11:00,500
is to increase the watch time, which means more ads, which means more money.

201
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:02,300
They do this on Snapchat too.

202
00:11:02,300 --> 00:11:07,100
This reminds me of that one video I made where they spend 10 minutes burning sprinkles

203
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:11,800
and eggs in a waffle iron only for it to come out looking like this.

204
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:15,600
But I want to show you the reason I wanted to make this video because I found the most

205
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:20,300
insane conglomeration of celebrity tabloid stretching the video out.

206
00:11:20,300 --> 00:11:23,300
The most confusing video I've ever seen.

207
00:11:23,300 --> 00:11:27,300
Zac Efron failed in his latest millionaire project.

208
00:11:27,300 --> 00:11:30,700
Ah, yes, the failed celebrity, Zac Efron.

209
00:11:30,700 --> 00:11:35,600
They basically made up this entire narrative that Zac Efron is devastated

210
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:39,100
and now his career has plummeted and he's in turmoil.

211
00:11:39,100 --> 00:11:44,000
And today with his intervened face, his career is coming to an end.

212
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:47,000
The high school musical actor is devastated.

213
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:52,700
For years, he had to deal with horrible rumors about his swollen face due to bad surgery.

214
00:11:52,700 --> 00:11:56,300
You had to recently dispel rumors that you had undergone plastic surgery.

215
00:11:56,300 --> 00:11:57,800
You actually experienced it.

216
00:11:57,800 --> 00:12:00,600
But the truth was different.

217
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:06,500
He was found on the floor of his house after a terrible domestic accident.

218
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:09,600
His jaw was dislocated.

219
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:12,200
But the public only cared about how he looked.

220
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:14,800
That's why his new project failed.

221
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:20,600
His new project failed because he was ugly and the public only cared about that.

222
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:26,400
As if that wasn't enough, another image of the actor with grotesque muscles went viral.

223
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:29,200
He became the laughing stock again.

224
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:31,400
Everyone hates Zac Efron.

225
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:36,200
But after all the hype surrounding his face, he had to speak up.

226
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:40,400
After the traumatic accident,

227
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:44,000
Efron's career declined.

228
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:51,800
But the trip to Australia to film his failed show wasn't in vain because Zac found a love at a cafe.

229
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:55,800
He met a 25-year-old waitress who stole his heart.

230
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:58,100
She was everything he was looking for.

231
00:12:58,100 --> 00:13:02,400
She seemed to be the right one for him.

232
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:06,600
She was a normal and down-to-earth woman.

233
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:15,000
But it seems Vanessa had other intentions and would break Efron's heart again.

234
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:18,300
After 10 months, Vanessa betrayed him.

235
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:22,400
She was tempted by the fame and Zac lost control.

236
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:30,200
He kicked her off the set of his series, ending the idyllic romance.

237
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:34,200
Zac discovered that Valadarys had other intentions.

238
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:41,900
She was tempted by fame and money and accepted a contract to participate in a controversial reality show.

239
00:13:41,900 --> 00:13:43,500
Why are we talking about her now?

240
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:48,300
There are more twists and turns in this video than there are on an average road in Massachusetts.

241
00:13:48,300 --> 00:13:52,000
But upon his return, Zac worried his fans again.

242
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:56,700
New images with a bulked physique put him in the spotlight once again.

243
00:13:56,700 --> 00:14:00,000
But this time, he went overboard at the gym.

244
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:03,600
And just a few months, he completely transformed.

245
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:06,400
And looks like a different person.

246
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:09,800
But this time, it's all due to a new project.

247
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:10,600
Woo!

248
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:16,000
Zac plays the wrestler Kevin Von Erich for the movie The Iron Claw.

249
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,300
God, he had me worried there.

250
00:14:17,300 --> 00:14:19,500
That was another big twist twist in this video.

251
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:20,100
I got worried.

252
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:22,800
Imagine if someone made this, but it's about your life.

253
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:26,400
Gabby Bell failed in her latest millionaire project.

254
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:31,900
And today, with her intervened face, her career is coming to an end.

255
00:14:31,900 --> 00:14:42,000
Because her fans keep saying she looks like Michael Reeves, another YouTuber on youtube.com.

256
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:46,800
The young star is devastated and shares a birthday with Usher.

257
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:49,300
Reminds me of these videos that are like,

258
00:14:49,300 --> 00:14:52,000
Mr. Beast is dying very soon.

259
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:55,000
Mr. Beast has a condition called Crohn's disease.

260
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,700
Mr. Beast could die from this.

261
00:14:56,700 --> 00:15:02,200
I'm so glad I could finally show someone that video because I reference it at least three times a week.

262
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:06,700
Because there's a response video to that from what might be the same guy.

263
00:15:06,700 --> 00:15:08,800
Mr. Beast is not dying.

264
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:14,100
A YouTuber just claimed Mr. Beast will pass away soon because he has Crohn's disease.

265
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:16,800
Mr. Beast is dying very soon.

266
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:19,800
Mr. Beast has a condition called Crohn's disease.

267
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:21,500
Mr. Beast could die from this.

268
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:25,400
Mr. Beast does have this disease, but it's very rarely fatal

269
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:28,700
and he definitely won't pass away from it anytime soon.

270
00:15:28,700 --> 00:15:32,900
Lying about Mr. Beast dying for views is honestly disgusting.

271
00:15:33,700 --> 00:15:39,100
But before we get into the even wilder stuff I found on Facebook, which is no one's surprise,

272
00:15:39,100 --> 00:15:42,500
you might end up wanting to sign up for the sponsor of today's video, Aura.

273
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:47,700
Aura is an online privacy tool with a multitude of resources like password manager, VPN,

274
00:15:47,700 --> 00:15:49,600
credit locking, and fraud monitoring.

275
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:53,400
Just the other day, there was a breach that involved my email on a website

276
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:56,100
and it notified me and I changed my password immediately.

277
00:15:56,100 --> 00:15:59,800
For those of you that use the same password for everything, this is why you shouldn't.

278
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:02,800
Don't do that. Use a password manager genuinely.

279
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:06,700
I was also doing some fun stuff where a company had to soft check my credit report

280
00:16:06,700 --> 00:16:09,700
and even after unlocking it Aura notified me immediately

281
00:16:09,700 --> 00:16:11,800
before it was even approved by the company.

282
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:14,700
It's a pretty cool tool and I've been using it for a few years now

283
00:16:14,700 --> 00:16:18,000
and I've forced my entire family to be on the family plan and it's great.

284
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,600
If you're interested, you can get two weeks for free using my link.

285
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:24,300
It's aura.com slash Gabby Bell or you can scan the QR code on the screen

286
00:16:24,300 --> 00:16:26,100
or the link is in the description below.

287
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:27,300
Thanks to Aura for sponsoring.

288
00:16:27,300 --> 00:16:30,200
Checking out the sponsor really helps the channel and be safe out there

289
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:34,500
because especially on Facebook because this is about to get wild.

290
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:38,100
Now, that was just my initial scroll as I was laying on the ground

291
00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:42,200
procrastinating my plunge into the toilet of Facebook Marketplace.

292
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:46,000
But upon spending the most time on Facebook that I have since 2016,

293
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:49,100
I thought joining a bunch of mom groups would be hilarious

294
00:16:49,100 --> 00:16:52,000
to see whatever shenanigans they were talking about in there.

295
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:56,700
But instead, I logged on later to continue my rediscovery of making Facebook

296
00:16:56,700 --> 00:17:00,900
part of my daily routine and the first thing I was assaulted with

297
00:17:00,900 --> 00:17:05,900
was a carousel of the most disgusting pictures of a child's foot

298
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:12,700
with a giant piece of foot crust in the shape and color of a Pringle peeled off his foot.

299
00:17:12,700 --> 00:17:15,900
No sensor warning, no slash spoiler.

300
00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:21,100
Even Instagram, also a meta company has built a feature that it will blur images

301
00:17:21,100 --> 00:17:22,600
it thinks are explicit.

302
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:25,900
But this was an uncensored attack on my eyes.

303
00:17:25,900 --> 00:17:29,500
I didn't even think to look at the comments because I just immediately left the group.

304
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:31,400
I saw one image and left.

305
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:39,000
So I gave up on that idea and I started scrolling through the popular public group suggestions

306
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:44,300
and found groups like chickens, chickens, chickens, which contained photos of chickens and eggs.

307
00:17:44,300 --> 00:17:45,000
8 out of 10.

308
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,200
I'm high and this is Sardu Valley.

309
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:49,800
5 out of 10 cute posts but not enough drama.

310
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:54,200
There's also frog posting a Facebook group where you post frog content.

311
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:55,200
I got what I came for.

312
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:55,800
9 out of 10.

313
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:58,700
Plunging into the depths of Facebook group hell,

314
00:17:58,700 --> 00:18:02,000
I came to this conclusion about young people who still use Facebook.

315
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:06,200
I know everyone was wondering this and I'm here to dispel the rumors and give you the facts.

316
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:10,700
It feels like there are four types of people under 30 who still use Facebook actively.

317
00:18:10,700 --> 00:18:13,400
And it's either to cross post your LinkedIn posts,

318
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:16,300
you're using it ironically and are in shit posting groups,

319
00:18:16,300 --> 00:18:18,300
you're an edge lord from 2016,

320
00:18:18,300 --> 00:18:20,500
or you're in frog spotting.

321
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:23,800
Isn't that just all social media now?

322
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:25,700
Like it's all like that.

323
00:18:25,700 --> 00:18:28,500
It hasn't changed.

324
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:30,500
Baddies in relationships.

325
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:34,700
Boyfriend texting married female coworker after working hours.

326
00:18:34,700 --> 00:18:35,200
Thoughts?

327
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:37,100
He talks a lot about female coworker.

328
00:18:37,100 --> 00:18:39,000
Her name comes up several times per week.

329
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,600
They've gone on a work trip together alone.

330
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:44,700
Last weekend he suddenly wanted to go for a local day trip

331
00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:46,700
and the car read aloud a text from her

332
00:18:46,700 --> 00:18:49,500
that she was coincidentally at the same location

333
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:51,400
like they were discussing it over text.

334
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:53,700
He mentioned her several times while we were out.

335
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:57,000
Altogether gave me the impression since he talks about her frequently,

336
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,100
he thinks of her a lot.

337
00:18:58,100 --> 00:18:59,800
Perhaps I think too much into things.

338
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:00,400
Thoughts?

339
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:03,500
And a group expert gives the great advice of

340
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:05,200
go through that phone.

341
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:06,400
Oh my god.

342
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:09,600
Listen, I support women's rights and women's wrongs,

343
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:10,200
but I...

344
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:11,300
This one's a bit far.

345
00:19:11,300 --> 00:19:13,400
10 out of 10, this group brought the drama.

346
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:15,300
Quotes and healing prayers.

347
00:19:15,300 --> 00:19:18,200
Your bank account is just about to overflow.

348
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:18,900
Put okay.

349
00:19:18,900 --> 00:19:19,700
Amen.

350
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:22,000
You people cannot follow directions.

351
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,600
And right when I was about to close the book on this saga,

352
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:27,700
you literally cannot be on Facebook for more than a couple hours

353
00:19:27,700 --> 00:19:30,600
if you're lucky without running into a scam.

354
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:35,400
On another post in this group, a reply to Amen was,

355
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:37,400
Send a friend request to Mrs. Angel.

356
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:38,300
She will help you.

357
00:19:38,300 --> 00:19:42,600
I am building my own house and I also have groceries through her company.

358
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:44,400
She is legit and trustworthy.

359
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:45,300
Click on her name.

360
00:19:45,300 --> 00:19:50,900
And in the URL, there's Bitcoin and it's to someone named Angle and not Angel.

361
00:19:50,900 --> 00:19:54,400
And this is definitely them in the profile picture and not fake at all.

362
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:57,900
Their header kind of tells us everything we need to know about what they do,

363
00:19:57,900 --> 00:19:59,700
except is this a thumb?

364
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:02,000
How does that even happen on this type of image?

365
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:06,900
We guarantee you the best trade strategies in business trade wisely

366
00:20:06,900 --> 00:20:09,300
and gain financial freedom.

367
00:20:09,300 --> 00:20:14,200
Bitcoin mining eight years years of University of San Diego.

368
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:18,100
I majored in Bitcoin mining for eight years years.

369
00:20:18,100 --> 00:20:18,400
Yeah.

370
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:23,700
And I did my master's in hacking class logistics of University of San Diego.

371
00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:27,400
This scammer in particular will Photoshop posts like this one

372
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:30,700
where they're pretending to be a satisfied investment client

373
00:20:30,700 --> 00:20:35,100
where they basically runescape scam you by promising to double your Bitcoin or money

374
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:38,400
and then tricking you in some way or just straight up stealing your money.

375
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:42,500
But this person obviously got a new car and store so we should be happy for them.

376
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:46,800
Like the 99 bot comments congratulating them in the exact same way.

377
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:52,000
I wanted to see if these bodied accounts were fake accounts or hacked ones of victims

378
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,600
and everything just keeps getting weirder.

379
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:56,900
I guess I shouldn't be surprised because it's Facebook,

380
00:20:56,900 --> 00:21:02,200
but every bot account I clicked on were from Lubbock, Texas, liked religious posts

381
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:05,200
and have posted a photo of themselves in the last month

382
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:07,200
and it's the first thing on their profile.

383
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:11,600
Now either the city of Lubbock has a really active crypto investment community

384
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:16,100
or these are hundreds if not thousands of fake profiles with the same parameters

385
00:21:16,100 --> 00:21:19,100
which is ironic considering Facebook blocks real accounts

386
00:21:19,100 --> 00:21:22,600
and asks for your physical government ID for you to log back in.

387
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:25,700
Yet their detection let's fake accounts flood the site.

388
00:21:25,700 --> 00:21:28,800
There was this really popular type of scam comment that I saw

389
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:32,200
that reads very much like a genuine message up until the end

390
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:36,500
and it's usually like a woman in distress about her husband potentially cheating

391
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:41,300
and so she hires a hacker to reveal all his emails, Facebook and Instagram chats,

392
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:45,600
real-time call listening and his long-deleted messages.

393
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:48,900
My god, these hackers have more technology than Nicholas Cage did

394
00:21:48,900 --> 00:21:51,000
to steal the Declaration of Independence.

395
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,600
But they'll refer the hacker's username at the end

396
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:57,900
to recommend to other vulnerable women in some potentially bad relationships.

397
00:21:57,900 --> 00:22:02,300
They must target religious groups in particular because of the trust that's there.

398
00:22:02,300 --> 00:22:04,900
Like, oh, this person is clearly an honest Christian,

399
00:22:04,900 --> 00:22:07,100
like it's less likely that it will be a scam.

400
00:22:07,100 --> 00:22:10,000
Plus, the demographic of people in religious Facebook groups

401
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:13,900
tend to be a bit older and a bit more easily tricked and fooled by this stuff

402
00:22:13,900 --> 00:22:15,500
that's pretending to be genuine.

403
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:18,400
And like I said in my last video about Facebook Marketplace,

404
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:21,900
Facebook loves to let these scammers run rampant on their platform

405
00:22:21,900 --> 00:22:23,300
without doing anything about it.

406
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:27,100
Last time I reported a scammer and they said we reviewed your report.

407
00:22:27,100 --> 00:22:29,200
We concluded, nah.

408
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:32,100
They basically forced the users to self-moderate.

409
00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:34,200
I noticed with a ton of the groups I joined,

410
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:39,200
I had to answer manual capture questions to make sure I was a real person

411
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:43,300
because the one public group I went in with no moderation was terrible.

412
00:22:43,300 --> 00:22:45,800
There were the same videos posted over and over

413
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:49,000
that had nothing to do with Star Wars Endor Bush posting,

414
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,400
promoting 18-plus pages,

415
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:56,400
which is not allowed on Facebook, I just looked it up.

416
00:22:56,400 --> 00:23:00,200
Facebook is a massive platform that spans across the globe

417
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:03,000
and makes it difficult to perfectly moderate.

418
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:07,200
But some of this stuff is like, dude, what's going on over there at Facebook HQ?

419
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:10,900
Among the groups and scams, this video will now come full circle

420
00:23:10,900 --> 00:23:14,700
because the other 80% of Facebook groups that were recommended to me

421
00:23:14,700 --> 00:23:18,800
were flooded with Timu and Xi'en support groups.

422
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:20,300
I joined all the ones I saw.

423
00:23:20,300 --> 00:23:22,000
Now what the hell are these?

424
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:28,300
I paused for a moment there

425
00:23:28,300 --> 00:23:32,500
and went down the most insane rabbit hole once again.

426
00:23:32,500 --> 00:23:36,400
These pages are full of posts from real people from what I've gathered,

427
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:41,600
asking to accept some sort of Timu invite for them to get a free gift.

428
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:46,100
And I kept seeing like farmland or fish land everywhere on it.

429
00:23:46,100 --> 00:23:50,900
And what it is, is these people are playing a game in the Timu app.

430
00:23:57,100 --> 00:24:01,300
It's a farming sim that allows you to quote-unquote earn coupons

431
00:24:01,300 --> 00:24:03,700
and free gifts upon playing their game.

432
00:24:03,700 --> 00:24:06,600
How could Timu possibly benefit from this?

433
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:10,400
Well, to water the plants and earn money, you need water

434
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:14,700
and they give you almost enough water to earn all their free gifts

435
00:24:14,700 --> 00:24:17,300
before they start making it more difficult.

436
00:24:17,300 --> 00:24:20,200
They ask you to invite friends to get more water

437
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:24,700
or just browse the items for 60 seconds to earn more water.

438
00:24:24,700 --> 00:24:30,900
And they ask you several times to spend $20 on Timu to get more water.

439
00:24:30,900 --> 00:24:34,600
Those are like special tasks that earn you more in the game.

440
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:36,900
They ask you to turn notifications on

441
00:24:36,900 --> 00:24:40,600
to remember to come back to claim more water from this loot box

442
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:43,600
and then invite more friends to get some water from that.

443
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:47,000
It's all purposefully to make shopping on Timu addictive

444
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:50,000
by forming the shopping experience around a game

445
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,900
all while you're recruiting new users for them.

446
00:24:52,900 --> 00:24:53,700
Wow.

447
00:24:53,700 --> 00:24:56,700
Plus these $30, $40 coupons they give you

448
00:24:56,700 --> 00:25:00,600
are just on orders over $100 that they put in small tax.

449
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:04,500
There was another link in one of these groups that said I could get seven free items

450
00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:07,900
and I picked out 10 really amazing items on here

451
00:25:07,900 --> 00:25:12,700
and I only had to pay for the last three items which was around $40.

452
00:25:12,700 --> 00:25:16,500
Also the insanity of claiming these items are way more expensive

453
00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:18,700
than they really are on Timu's website.

454
00:25:18,700 --> 00:25:20,100
It's just egregious.

455
00:25:20,100 --> 00:25:23,300
It makes you feel like you're getting a great discount and a great deal

456
00:25:23,300 --> 00:25:26,200
but you're really spending money that you otherwise wouldn't have

457
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:28,600
because you got sucked in with the seven free items

458
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:30,200
and now you're spending 40 bucks.

459
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:34,000
So these Facebook groups are built solely around accepting invites

460
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,100
to get discounts.

461
00:25:35,100 --> 00:25:37,800
They even do trades for she and gifts too

462
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:40,500
because it seems like they have some sort of game as well.

463
00:25:40,500 --> 00:25:41,700
I'm not sure how that one works

464
00:25:41,700 --> 00:25:45,700
because that is a huge rabbit hole for an entirely different video.

465
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:55,500
It feels like Facebook emerged during this Wild West era of the internet.

466
00:25:55,500 --> 00:25:58,700
Then it buttoned up early on in its career as a social media

467
00:25:58,700 --> 00:26:02,600
and quickly devolved back into the Wild West of the internet here.

468
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:06,700
You have to engage your ancient internet instincts while you're on Facebook

469
00:26:06,700 --> 00:26:08,700
because there's a scam at every corner.

470
00:26:08,700 --> 00:26:12,300
Anyway, thanks for tuning into this episode of me eventually finding a scam

471
00:26:12,300 --> 00:26:13,500
and everything I look into.

472
00:26:13,500 --> 00:26:15,000
I feel like a scam magnet.

473
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:19,500
I suppose this isn't exactly what is the traditional sense of the word scam

474
00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:22,800
but it sure is scummy tactics to get people to spend more money.

475
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:26,600
But I mean that's everything like casinos and stuff like it.

476
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:27,600
Everything is shit.

477
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:31,900
I am usually a positive person and try to find the positive in most things

478
00:26:31,900 --> 00:26:33,400
but man, this sucks.

479
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:36,200
And I really wrote this sucks

480
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:38,700
and then I turned off my computer and went to bed.

481
00:26:40,700 --> 00:26:43,500
I did not write a positive outro at all.

482
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:46,300
Anyway, send this to a parent who loves to click on fishing links

483
00:26:46,300 --> 00:26:48,100
and make sure that they don't.

484
00:26:49,100 --> 00:26:50,000
All right, that's it.

485
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:50,900
Bye.

486
00:27:01,900 --> 00:27:03,900
What?
