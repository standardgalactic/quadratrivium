00:00.000 --> 00:04.880
Have you ever been perusing Netflix and looking at all the comedy specials that you don't want to watch?

00:04.880 --> 00:10.080
Until you inevitably try one out and realize how much of a waste of time it is because,

00:10.080 --> 00:13.920
oh my god, this comedy special is made for someone 50 years older than me.

00:13.920 --> 00:17.600
But then, in the 80s, he put the earring in his right ear where,

00:17.600 --> 00:19.040
ELLEN SHOTS GAY!

00:19.040 --> 00:23.040
That's not always a bad thing. Sometimes it's just not your taste.

00:23.040 --> 00:25.120
Sometimes the content's just not made for you.

00:25.120 --> 00:28.720
Sometimes you're just not the target demographic, which is what I tell my parents

00:28.720 --> 00:32.480
when they watch my videos and they don't understand 90% of the references in them.

00:32.480 --> 00:35.760
So I've already established that everyone's comedy taste is different,

00:35.760 --> 00:39.200
and I know the title of this video, you might be like, oh goodness,

00:39.200 --> 00:43.280
she's a snowflake comedy police coming after my favorite guy.

00:43.280 --> 00:44.000
And you know what?

00:45.600 --> 00:46.480
Yeah, kinda.

00:47.040 --> 00:47.920
I'm just kidding.

00:47.920 --> 00:52.400
I understand that comedy is comedy, and we can make comedy out of serious situations.

00:52.400 --> 00:53.360
I really do.

00:53.360 --> 00:57.200
I really don't think every single thing has to be inherently problematic,

00:57.200 --> 01:00.080
and everything's a problem, and oh, cancel culture.

01:00.800 --> 01:06.480
But I do know things age poorly, and sometimes people also age poorly, and so do their jokes.

01:06.480 --> 01:11.520
There are a few comedy specials lately that have been buzzing everyone's cringe radar.

01:11.520 --> 01:13.120
They've been off the charts.

01:13.120 --> 01:15.360
The cringe meter has been breaking lately.

01:15.360 --> 01:17.360
I need to call the mechanic and get that fixed.

01:17.360 --> 01:21.680
The cringe meter was sounding the alarm, and like a fly to dog shit,

01:21.680 --> 01:26.800
I was there to stick my grubby little hands on it and get in there and see what it's all about.

01:26.800 --> 01:29.600
So I have three comedy specials I want to show you today.

01:29.600 --> 01:31.920
And by show you, I mean cringe with you.

01:31.920 --> 01:36.320
So the first one I want to show you today is this beautiful man, Jim Brewer.

01:37.200 --> 01:37.680
Brewer?

01:40.000 --> 01:41.440
I went to their stadium once.

01:41.440 --> 01:48.480
You thought I was gonna say hardly no or hardly ever is that a good joke unless Curtis Conner says it.

01:48.480 --> 01:48.960
That's it.

01:48.960 --> 01:52.160
So I'm gonna be honest, I know nothing about this dude,

01:52.240 --> 01:55.920
but oh boy, are the first six minutes of this comedy special,

01:55.920 --> 01:59.760
everything I need to see, and the only thing I want to see from this dude.

02:00.000 --> 02:05.760
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the stage, Jim Brewer!

02:17.760 --> 02:22.000
So we get this really lukewarm intro, and I really wish they like,

02:22.000 --> 02:26.640
the editors took the time to actually put the song in the special instead of just the

02:26.640 --> 02:30.000
recording of the sound going through a shitty microphone,

02:30.000 --> 02:31.840
at going in whatever theater they're in.

02:31.840 --> 02:34.160
So it's a little awkward, but it's fine.

02:34.160 --> 02:36.320
This is how I was imagining it to go.

02:36.320 --> 02:41.520
Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome your oomoo senpai, Jim Brewer!

02:41.520 --> 03:10.320
So yeah, after the classic rock you'd play while you're out fishing with your buds,

03:10.320 --> 03:13.520
he opens up with COVID humor.

03:15.280 --> 03:19.280
This was published four days ago, July 2022.

03:19.280 --> 03:23.760
So yeah, this is already not going to age well in about like yesterday.

03:23.760 --> 03:28.160
And just from this intro, you can tell that this is a guy that goes to like the neighbor's

03:28.160 --> 03:33.120
birthday party in like a suburban neighborhood and thinks he's fucking hilarious.

03:33.120 --> 03:35.600
Oh, you can't say anything anymore.

03:36.560 --> 03:40.160
We're risking our lives to be here.

03:54.000 --> 03:57.760
At this part, I was about to damn near jump out of my chair and crawl under the bed,

03:57.760 --> 03:59.360
because that took me by surprise.

03:59.360 --> 04:03.440
The gain on that was just like plus 10 over what he had before.

04:06.160 --> 04:26.320
So at this point, about 80% of this two minutes has just been him reenacting something.

04:26.320 --> 04:32.560
You'll see that this is a common theme, actually so much so that somebody made a compilation video

04:32.560 --> 04:38.640
of this special, but just the the unintelligible bits and there's a lot of it.

04:38.640 --> 04:45.840
This is like 90% of his comedy is just over the top imitations of a person that doesn't exist in the world.

04:50.560 --> 04:51.120
You hear that?

04:51.120 --> 04:56.320
That's all of your grandpas and problematic uncles at every family gathering cheering for this guy.

04:56.320 --> 04:59.440
The vaccinators, you were real cocky a couple of months ago.

05:00.720 --> 05:02.080
We got vaccinated.

05:08.880 --> 05:12.080
Got my second shot April 19th.

05:15.920 --> 05:20.160
I can't get sick from the corona.

05:20.160 --> 05:21.680
I'm vaccinated.

05:21.680 --> 05:22.880
No one ever said that.

05:23.440 --> 05:24.800
No one ever said that.

05:24.880 --> 05:26.000
See this bucket of virus?

05:29.200 --> 05:30.160
I'm vaccinated.

05:32.800 --> 05:34.160
I'll even lick metal.

05:34.160 --> 05:35.520
I'm not afraid of anything.

05:37.760 --> 05:44.560
See, I told you it's just him unintelligibly reenacting something or someone that maybe one

05:44.560 --> 05:48.640
person has said I would bet you one person thought that, but it's not true.

05:48.640 --> 05:54.640
Not to be a anti-comedy Andy here, but no one ever said you couldn't get sick when you got

05:54.800 --> 06:00.400
vaccinated or, um, I'm sorry, the schmackschismation is just something that would prevent you from

06:01.280 --> 06:04.800
dying or going to the hospital in serious condition is all.

06:04.800 --> 06:05.360
That's it.

06:05.360 --> 06:10.960
That no one said it was gonna make you super man or iron man just battling the virus like

06:12.240 --> 06:16.720
see let me take a let me take a page out of Jim Brewer hardly know where his book here and

06:16.720 --> 06:22.240
and give you a taste of my own taste, my own flavor, my own adaptation of Jim Brewer's comedy.

06:22.240 --> 06:27.440
No one's going out here in a fucking iron iron man suit after getting the schmackschismation

06:28.000 --> 06:28.400
going.

06:32.400 --> 06:33.680
Can't touch me now virus.

06:39.120 --> 06:40.400
That's me in my Batmobile.

06:42.880 --> 06:44.400
Just dodging all the viruses.

06:47.840 --> 06:48.560
Are you laughing?

06:48.560 --> 06:49.120
Thank you.

06:49.120 --> 06:50.080
Thank you.

06:50.080 --> 06:52.320
Yes, uh, that's comedy here.

06:52.320 --> 06:53.840
I don't have to wear a mask.

06:56.720 --> 06:58.560
That's exactly what I did.

06:58.560 --> 07:03.200
As soon as I got my second vaccination, I went, I don't have to wear my mask.

07:06.080 --> 07:07.120
I know this is a joke.

07:07.120 --> 07:13.120
Okay, I obviously know he's not being completely serious, but this is rooted in some truth.

07:13.120 --> 07:18.560
Like he actually kind of thinks this, you know, he at least says it to his buddies behind the scenes.

07:19.120 --> 07:20.880
People vaccinated getting sick.

07:20.880 --> 07:21.280
What?

07:23.920 --> 07:25.440
You need a new booster.

07:25.440 --> 07:25.920
What?

07:28.960 --> 07:30.000
Who wants a shot?

07:30.000 --> 07:31.520
Who wants to see a ball game?

07:39.280 --> 07:40.320
Wave your flipper.

07:43.280 --> 07:44.240
That's for you.

07:44.240 --> 07:45.760
Go see the ball game.

07:45.760 --> 07:47.840
Who wants, who wants to work again?

07:49.120 --> 07:50.320
Who wants to work again?

07:50.320 --> 08:02.080
I have no idea where this comparison even came from.

08:02.080 --> 08:04.560
I had watched this before and I didn't get it.

08:04.560 --> 08:06.160
And I thought upon rewatching it.

08:06.160 --> 08:09.520
I would understand how like, I don't even know who he's imitating.

08:09.520 --> 08:11.120
Is he, are we seals?

08:11.120 --> 08:14.480
Are we seals for, for getting the schmackschismation?

08:14.480 --> 08:15.440
Is that what it is?

08:15.440 --> 08:16.640
Are we just play seals?

08:16.640 --> 08:20.640
Is the point that we just like go along with whatever the authorities are saying?

08:20.640 --> 08:23.360
Is that, is that that I don't understand?

08:23.920 --> 08:24.880
What's in the shot?

08:24.880 --> 08:25.680
It's safe.

08:25.680 --> 08:26.320
Don't worry.

08:27.440 --> 08:28.160
Don't worry.

08:29.200 --> 08:31.200
The ingredients are on the website.

08:31.200 --> 08:31.840
Trust me.

08:31.840 --> 08:37.120
I, I looked up so many, so many different sources for what's in it.

08:37.120 --> 08:38.080
You know, it's new.

08:38.080 --> 08:38.880
It's brand new.

08:38.880 --> 08:40.080
It was coming out really fast.

08:40.080 --> 08:41.600
It was a stressful time.

08:41.600 --> 08:44.240
A lot of friends that I had were nervous about getting the shot,

08:44.240 --> 08:45.600
even though they're, they're for it.

08:45.600 --> 08:47.040
I just, I'm so confused.

08:47.040 --> 08:51.760
So yeah, I've, I looked up extensively what was in it and I can confirm that it is safe.

08:52.400 --> 08:53.280
I didn't die.

08:53.280 --> 08:53.840
I'm here.

08:54.800 --> 08:55.520
I'm good.

08:55.520 --> 09:01.120
I'm confused what the purpose of this is in the, in the good big year of 2022.

09:01.120 --> 09:03.600
You know, like we've, we've gone through this.

09:03.600 --> 09:05.840
Like, I don't feel like getting into this.

09:05.840 --> 09:16.560
I, I mean, when I take all the steps back, I feel like this is going to be a Broadway

09:16.560 --> 09:17.840
play in three years.

09:20.080 --> 09:20.880
You know what I mean?

09:20.880 --> 09:21.360
Like, wait.

09:28.880 --> 09:30.080
Six foot safe.

09:35.840 --> 09:41.600
Don't shoot distance six foot safe.

09:41.600 --> 09:44.800
This bit goes on for way too long.

09:44.800 --> 09:50.480
And I hope by now you can understand why I couldn't stomach to watch any more of this

09:50.480 --> 09:55.280
entire hour long special because I bet you it's, it's more of this.

09:55.280 --> 09:59.200
It's a lot more of this where he's just reenacting something.

09:59.200 --> 10:01.120
That's the whole comedy.

10:01.120 --> 10:02.880
Can we switch it up a little bit?

10:06.400 --> 10:18.960
Like the bit is dead at this point and he just keeps going, keeps killing it.

10:18.960 --> 10:23.680
And you know, they say if you can't, if you can't beat them, join them.

10:23.680 --> 10:24.480
So let's do that.

10:36.560 --> 10:40.080
I'm the grand ma killer.

10:46.800 --> 10:48.080
Six foot safe.

10:48.800 --> 10:51.360
Yeah, six foot safe.

10:51.920 --> 10:53.360
It's not even a good show too.

10:53.360 --> 10:55.440
And like, I can't even build off of that.

10:55.440 --> 10:56.720
Six foot safe.

10:57.680 --> 11:01.120
How am I going to know if it's okay?

11:01.200 --> 11:05.520
How do I know if I can see Aunt Linda today?

11:06.720 --> 11:08.080
Well, I don't know.

11:09.040 --> 11:12.480
I don't know who's gonna show me.

11:13.600 --> 11:16.400
Who's gonna show me how.

11:16.400 --> 11:26.400
And we have to cover our face in the name of grace just to feel disconnected.

11:27.200 --> 11:31.360
Aunt Linda, when am I gonna see you?

11:32.720 --> 11:42.560
Hopefully in a year or two, I can see you and Uncle Jim too.

11:45.120 --> 11:49.440
Curtains close and that's the end of the first musical number.

11:49.840 --> 11:52.080
Scene two opens.

11:52.880 --> 11:56.800
Crazy Uncle Jim Brewer sitting at the family dining table.

11:56.800 --> 11:58.400
No mask alone.

11:58.400 --> 11:59.440
One chair apart.

12:00.240 --> 12:02.800
The family sitting at the rest of the table.

12:02.800 --> 12:04.000
Disappointed.

12:04.000 --> 12:05.600
Listen to the rules.

12:09.840 --> 12:11.200
Here come the governors.

12:15.760 --> 12:18.240
We have no laws and regulations.

12:19.440 --> 12:32.160
We shall determine who is essential.

12:32.160 --> 12:36.880
So at first I thought he was trying to do this like really horrible Chinese accent.

12:37.920 --> 12:44.400
And then I realized it's actually a horrible German accent and he's equating the American

12:44.400 --> 12:52.960
government to a point in history where things got a little crazy.

12:54.880 --> 12:59.520
I know jokes are supposed to be exaggerations but it's just not even funny.

13:01.840 --> 13:06.640
Because the whole bit is just him pacing around making a silly face.

13:06.640 --> 13:11.680
It's like he watched one Dane Cook special in 2008 and was like this.

13:11.680 --> 13:13.600
This is the pinnacle of comedy.

13:15.280 --> 13:23.360
Don't get me wrong I I that's actually that's the whole problem.

13:23.360 --> 13:28.000
I used to like Dane Cook's comedy and you know what else I was also like 10.

13:28.640 --> 13:31.840
So that about says everything you need to know.

13:31.840 --> 13:36.320
It's comedy from 12 years ago and it should stay there.

13:36.320 --> 13:37.840
It was good for its time.

13:37.840 --> 13:40.720
You could leave it just leave it in 2008.

13:40.720 --> 13:48.640
We shall determine who may go at your house and who shall have a muffin.

13:56.000 --> 14:06.240
And remember if you see any children playing ooms outside together report them and their parents.

14:06.240 --> 14:10.240
This is for your safety.

14:14.240 --> 14:16.800
See the bit just goes on for too long.

14:16.800 --> 14:22.400
I also am interested to know what the age range of this theater happens to be.

14:22.400 --> 14:28.800
If we got a glimpse of the audience and what I wonder I just wonder that's all I'm just wondering.

14:29.040 --> 14:41.360
Okay that's it that's eight stop stop two there's two I have I have I've had enough of this bit.

14:41.360 --> 14:46.320
Okay so you've seen all that right that was the first like that was only six and a half minutes.

14:46.320 --> 14:53.360
It felt like 30 and if there was that much like reenactment in just those six minutes

14:53.360 --> 14:57.200
of him like exaggerating and overreacting check this out.

14:57.200 --> 15:00.960
This is Jim Brewer's stand-up comedy but only the unintelligible parts.

15:00.960 --> 15:02.720
I recommend you watch this for yourself.

15:02.720 --> 15:04.880
I'll link this video in the description below.

15:04.880 --> 15:07.600
I'll only show you a little bit.

15:27.440 --> 15:36.000
So that's just 30 seconds of it.

15:36.000 --> 15:42.320
This compilation is eight minutes long and I know for a fact that there's more of it.

15:42.320 --> 15:46.000
I know for a fact this person didn't even get all of the clips.

15:46.000 --> 15:49.200
So that's about all I could handle for this portion of the video.

15:49.200 --> 15:53.680
The next comedian I want to cover here is Brendan Schaub and I know other people have

15:53.680 --> 15:59.600
talked about him and he's actually the most recurring guest on the Joe Rogan podcast albeit

15:59.600 --> 16:04.480
I think they're more of the older episodes that he was on and he also used to be a

16:04.480 --> 16:06.000
MMA question mark fighter.

16:06.000 --> 16:07.440
Yeah he does MMA.

16:07.440 --> 16:09.280
He does Brazilian Jiu Jitsu.

16:09.280 --> 16:11.920
He also has like three different podcasts.

16:11.920 --> 16:13.680
The Fighter and the Kid podcast.

16:13.680 --> 16:16.400
The Below the Belt with Brendan Schaub podcast.

16:16.400 --> 16:21.040
And co-host of the King and Sting podcast with another comedian Theo Vaughn.

16:21.040 --> 16:23.280
The mullet guy you've probably seen clips of him.

16:23.280 --> 16:28.560
So considering that Joe Rogan also went from the UFC to comedy to podcasting.

16:28.560 --> 16:31.280
I'm here looking for guys to suck my dick and there's nothing.

16:31.280 --> 16:36.320
It seems Brendan Schaub wanted to follow in his daddy's footsteps and do the same thing.

16:36.320 --> 16:40.320
And you know from what I understand here not everyone can be good at everything.

16:40.320 --> 16:45.360
Okay I'm not sitting here expecting these people to be like the best comedians on the planet.

16:45.360 --> 16:48.800
Sometimes you're gonna make something and it's gonna flop and it's gonna kind of suck.

16:48.800 --> 16:50.880
Okay that's just the nature of things.

16:50.880 --> 16:53.200
We all have our flop era whether we like it or not.

16:53.200 --> 16:54.320
That's just human nature.

16:54.320 --> 16:55.760
It's nothing to be ashamed of.

16:55.760 --> 17:00.960
Unfortunately Brendan Schaub's flop era also includes um bad racist comedy.

17:00.960 --> 17:02.480
But we'll get to that in a second.

17:02.480 --> 17:06.400
So Brendan Schaub's special is 25 minutes long.

17:06.400 --> 17:10.240
Posted on the Thick Boy channel with three C's.

17:10.240 --> 17:12.240
Granted he's almost 40 but it's fine.

17:12.240 --> 17:14.800
The special is called the Gringo Poppy.

17:14.800 --> 17:20.560
So you see the branding here is already a little um Mexican and um no.

17:20.560 --> 17:21.680
He's not Mexican.

17:22.320 --> 17:23.200
His wife is.

17:23.200 --> 17:26.960
And you can see by the dislike ratio that this was not received very well.

17:27.600 --> 17:53.840
So this is already starting off better than Jim Brewer's uh where they actually overlaid

17:53.840 --> 17:58.240
the song that was playing correctly over the special before he gets on stage.

17:58.240 --> 17:59.920
So Brownie points there.

17:59.920 --> 18:04.000
I also believe this is an original song made specifically for this and um

18:04.000 --> 18:05.200
It goes hard as fuck.

18:05.200 --> 18:06.960
Thick boy squad.

18:06.960 --> 18:09.120
Thick boy nation.

18:09.120 --> 18:11.680
You can catch that cover on my second channel.

18:11.680 --> 18:17.840
So we have this really sad kind of middle school play set here of a city skyline made

18:17.840 --> 18:20.000
with like poster paper from Michaels.

18:20.000 --> 18:20.720
You know it's fine.

18:20.720 --> 18:21.360
It's fine.

18:21.360 --> 18:23.840
You got to make do with what you have.

18:23.840 --> 18:24.160
Okay.

18:25.120 --> 18:27.200
What's up Dallas?

18:32.640 --> 18:34.800
Look at you guys.

18:35.760 --> 18:36.880
I'm not used to this.

18:36.880 --> 18:37.920
Dallas a little different.

18:37.920 --> 18:40.000
There are some ladies in the crowd tonight.

18:41.520 --> 18:42.640
I am not used to that.

18:45.280 --> 18:48.000
They don't have women where you're from.

18:48.000 --> 18:52.000
It's also pretty funny that this is Texas because you have this guy on the left here

18:52.000 --> 18:53.840
with a don't tread on me sweater.

18:53.840 --> 18:55.920
My demo 18 to 36 bros.

18:55.920 --> 18:59.440
That's that's what I specialize in.

18:59.440 --> 19:02.240
Sure I won't argue with that demographic.

19:02.240 --> 19:03.680
Are we vaccinated up in here Dallas?

19:03.680 --> 19:04.560
Everybody vaccinated?

19:06.880 --> 19:11.200
I don't know why these people keep bringing up COVID in their comedy specials in the good

19:11.200 --> 19:14.800
year of 2022 but I'm gonna be honest I'm sick of hearing it.

19:14.800 --> 19:16.080
Can we please stop?

19:16.720 --> 19:18.640
Please talk about something else.

19:18.640 --> 19:21.280
I'm here to laugh, not be sad.

19:21.280 --> 19:22.240
There's always one guy.

19:22.240 --> 19:23.520
No fucking way bro.

19:29.680 --> 19:32.000
That needle's not touching this fucking temple daddy.

19:35.040 --> 19:37.600
As he says that he's taking a nacho dip in a nacho cheese.

19:40.640 --> 19:42.560
Oh my bad Mr. Whole Foods.

19:43.200 --> 19:49.600
So what Brandon's trying to do here is do a little bit of crowd work which is when a

19:49.600 --> 19:56.400
comedian you know picks on people in the crowd and um man it doesn't go very well and I feel

19:56.400 --> 20:01.200
like people are really hard on this guy and hard on all these comedians really.

20:01.200 --> 20:06.080
Not that they don't deserve to be grilled a little bit but it is really difficult.

20:06.080 --> 20:11.120
It's not something that is easy to do and they're just bad at it because they're dumb.

20:11.120 --> 20:16.000
Like it's really difficult and hard to master especially if you're new at comedy which I think

20:16.000 --> 20:21.760
Brandon's job is new at least at stand-up but that doesn't mean that it's immune from cringe

20:21.760 --> 20:23.200
and it's a little cringe.

20:23.200 --> 20:28.480
Like he just made up a guy and like we did not see maybe it's because we weren't there but

20:28.480 --> 20:31.920
we did not see any guy that was like no fucking way bro.

20:31.920 --> 20:35.760
This needle ain't touching this daddy temple or whatever the fuck he said.

20:35.760 --> 20:40.160
This whole vaccination stuff I'm not anti-vaxx man I'm vaccinated but it's uh.

20:40.160 --> 20:43.440
I don't care I'm gonna move on to the juicy part.

20:43.440 --> 20:46.160
I'm married to Mexican y'all I'm married to Mexican.

20:46.160 --> 20:51.920
And that is why it's called the gringo poppy because I'm married to Mexican.

20:51.920 --> 20:56.720
Dallas I don't mean like Taco Bell Mexican no no no I'm talking Guadalajara.

20:58.000 --> 21:02.080
Born and raised came to the states 10 years ago illegally Mexican.

21:04.560 --> 21:06.880
What is a Taco Bell Mexican Brandon?

21:06.880 --> 21:08.640
What is a Taco Bell Mexican?

21:08.640 --> 21:14.320
I um what I am interpreting this statement as is there are.

21:16.800 --> 21:22.480
It's like if we said oh this is a this isn't a a Walmart white person.

21:22.480 --> 21:28.560
This is a Crayton Barrel white person because that's that's the vibe that I'm getting from this.

21:29.200 --> 21:32.640
So we're already putting Mexicans down in kind of a weird way.

21:33.600 --> 21:36.720
You can bring your wife up without insulting other people.

21:36.720 --> 21:42.000
I forget this one of my boys goes dude dude poppy what are you doing bro get with a Latina

21:42.000 --> 21:47.360
bro you know why because they're fun and they're spicy no doubt definitely spicy

21:47.360 --> 21:52.880
girl spicy right girl spicy you know what spicy means they're assholes that's what that means.

21:57.040 --> 22:01.680
We love the stereotypical sassy mean Latina.

22:02.000 --> 22:07.600
Seven nights a week I'm not used to this I was like what the heat is every Wednesday fuck yeah

22:09.760 --> 22:15.040
no dumb ass up the heat is every Wednesday real Mexican dishes y'all real shit from the motherland

22:15.040 --> 22:17.760
I'm talking Wavos Ventil

22:17.760 --> 22:19.760
Yo

22:33.120 --> 22:40.960
Yeah so that's that's the comedy here um boy you can do self deprecating humor like this uh

22:40.960 --> 22:44.800
just because you talk about another race doesn't mean it's inherently racist you can

22:45.280 --> 22:52.800
believe it or not joke about other races without being racist but this is not it this is not it

22:52.800 --> 22:57.440
I guess it just seems like cringy and stupid like I don't know how else to describe it

22:57.440 --> 23:03.120
dude I did that 23 and me I did that shit you spin the cup email your DNA in I did that

23:03.120 --> 23:07.920
they sent me drive mayonnaise back I am white as shit Dallas yeah

23:08.320 --> 23:13.040
yeah my person handout page seven bitch I need a fucking tater tot once a week

23:15.680 --> 23:18.160
with a fucking hot pocket kill you every now and then

23:20.320 --> 23:24.480
every time dinner we come I'm like oh does she really think beans go with every goddamn mail

23:24.480 --> 23:30.160
she's serious so like sometimes it is fun to joke about and see the differences between our culture

23:30.160 --> 23:36.160
and someone else's especially when you're married to that person but when you take that person's

23:36.160 --> 23:42.880
culture and then make it your aesthetic and identity it's a little weird I can only speak

23:42.880 --> 23:48.880
from personal experience but I've seen when um specifically white people will date someone

23:48.880 --> 23:56.320
who's Asian and then they think that gives them a pass to like be an honorary asian you're not

23:57.040 --> 24:03.200
you're not you that doesn't mean you can use stereotypically asian imagery and scenery and

24:03.200 --> 24:08.240
you're like your aesthetics and the way you dress and do your makeup so you look more asian

24:08.240 --> 24:13.120
to make their eyes look longer and look more asian it's okay if you learn another language

24:13.120 --> 24:16.800
because of your significant other I think that's really sweet I think that's cool I don't know

24:16.800 --> 24:21.600
how to put like a hard line in the sand of when it gets weird but sometimes it's weird sometimes

24:21.600 --> 24:26.240
it just gets weird every time dinner come like does it ever occur to her maybe Brennan's not

24:26.240 --> 24:35.440
trying to shit his pants tonight how about that all right so we've hit mainly stereotypes so far

24:35.440 --> 24:42.800
Mexican food spicy Mexican food hard to pronounce oh they have beans a lot Taco Bell all the hard

24:42.880 --> 24:47.120
hitters there every time dinner would come my asshole go like this

24:51.360 --> 24:58.320
we're dying down here puppy it's so spicy bro I've never been thicker since I got with a

24:58.320 --> 25:06.880
Mexican man thick with three fucking seas he said the thing he said the thing he said the thing

25:06.880 --> 25:10.880
everything they eat bean cheese bean cheese bean cheese bean cheese like the hell man

25:10.880 --> 25:16.320
we're just gonna carb load year-round we never tailor off the carbs that's a game plan beans and

25:16.320 --> 25:21.360
cheese aren't particularly known for their carbs but go off I walk in the house last Friday

25:22.160 --> 25:27.200
show enough there's a fucking fiesta my favorite food you know how like feel von

25:27.200 --> 25:38.960
can brown cocaine you know how like he struggles with cocaine like if there was cocaine on the

25:39.040 --> 25:44.000
table right now he'd fucking snort it from right field you feel me god bless him I love that

25:44.000 --> 25:50.400
fucking dude that's I am with fucking plus only I came out of nowhere and on that note

25:51.040 --> 25:57.040
basically TLDR when comedy relies on purely just stereotypes of another race it's just not that

25:57.040 --> 26:02.480
funny I really don't think he's actually racist and I really do think he loves his Mexican wife

26:02.480 --> 26:07.280
and he loves the food and he loves the culture I really do believe that I just think the execution

26:07.280 --> 26:14.080
of this special with these jokes maybe not the best representation of that because there is a

26:14.080 --> 26:19.280
way where you could possibly do that while still showing that you're endearing and you love you

26:19.280 --> 26:25.200
love this culture and but still making some funny jokes about it but this was not that

26:25.200 --> 26:31.840
unfortunately it was neither endearing nor funny so with that I want to show you the last comedy

26:31.840 --> 26:39.840
special which is you know him you know him as the host of fear factor oh you didn't mean either

26:39.840 --> 26:46.880
because I completely did not recognize him with hair I know Joe Rogan has a 2019 comedy special

26:46.880 --> 26:52.160
and I watched the beginning of it and it wasn't terrible I firmly believe that you can dislike

26:52.160 --> 26:58.160
someone or you can like someone but still criticize the piece of media as it is you know you can not

26:58.160 --> 27:03.600
like Joe Rogan that much which I kind of don't but that doesn't mean everything he does is

27:03.600 --> 27:08.320
automatically going to be unfunny and terrible because you know he's a fully dimensional person

27:08.320 --> 27:14.640
as as are we all then again I did not watch the rest of this hour and 15 minutes of this 2019

27:14.640 --> 27:19.120
comedy special so hopefully there's not anything in there that I would want to take back that statement

27:19.120 --> 27:24.880
for um and uh yeah I wrote this down a unicorn is a donkey from the future

27:27.840 --> 27:32.800
what the fuck does that mean it means you need to stop smoking so much weed stupid

27:32.800 --> 27:38.800
yep pretty good anyway if you didn't know that he's actually been doing stand up for a long ass time

27:38.800 --> 27:45.680
actually since 1994 and I did not know people were still alive back then so I want to watch a

27:45.680 --> 27:51.520
little bit of that with you because oh boy when I talk about humor that didn't age well

27:52.240 --> 27:56.880
this is it tonight show features the comedy of Joe Rogan

27:58.720 --> 28:04.960
holy shit these graphics dude I don't know exactly when this specific special was but I can

28:04.960 --> 28:08.720
probably safely say from these graphics this is from the 90s

28:15.680 --> 28:20.640
this is ronda shear no I don't know who she is and I'm not going to tell you

28:21.680 --> 28:27.280
but I do love her hair I've been trying to achieve this style and I do not know how because I do

28:27.280 --> 28:32.320
not own a blow dryer so that's all I wanted to add to this little bit and let's hear it Mark one more

28:32.320 --> 28:41.600
time for the spotlight cafe I also just want to point out that this person on the left here is

28:41.600 --> 28:47.200
playing a key tar first of all coolest shit but also the cherry on top is that they're wearing

28:47.200 --> 28:51.920
sunglasses with it I want to be their friend anyway you ready to meet your first act this evening

28:51.920 --> 29:00.960

29:01.680 --> 29:05.440
who ronda you know you don't have to gas me up like that you look ready

29:09.280 --> 29:15.280
where did this outfit change come from holy shit she just introduced the show and then go back

29:15.280 --> 29:21.120
and change or did she just rip it off like she looks like she's ready for a wwe match she's about

29:21.120 --> 29:27.520
to damn near jump in the ring here for double cage match featuring Logan Paul I know things about

29:27.520 --> 29:34.560
wrestling put your hands together from Mr. Joe Rogan so enough of the dilly dallying here we're

29:34.560 --> 29:42.000
finally introduced to Joe Rogan from almost 30 years ago

29:42.000 --> 29:53.440
so

30:00.320 --> 30:07.200
so yeah that immediately immediately didn't age well what an introduction these sideburns

30:07.440 --> 30:13.120
killing me too and yeah his voice is like it's like you know that the spirit of Joe Rogan is

30:13.120 --> 30:18.480
in there but I can't find him it's like the spirit of Joe Rogan has overtaken this young man

30:18.480 --> 30:22.320
having a rough week man I've been here the m word too much for my girlfriend and I'm talking

30:22.320 --> 30:26.560
about she brings up marriage a little bit too much and it's uh I can't even hear that word hear

30:26.560 --> 30:31.120
the word marriage my brain just shuts off it's like marriage click everyone after marriage is

30:37.280 --> 30:43.520
I'm like that's that's like a contract I sign this I can't have sex with other girls for the

30:43.520 --> 30:51.600
rest of my life and I gotta buy you a ring yeah it's everything you ever wanted this to be

30:52.240 --> 31:00.640

31:09.360 --> 31:16.960
okay yeah woohoo okay let's uh and on that note I'm skipping ahead see we don't understand men

31:16.960 --> 31:20.720
because you don't have testosterone that's the big thing you don't have to donkey donkey juice so

31:20.720 --> 31:26.960
you can't appreciate the way guys act okay so now we're into like alpha male podcaster territory

31:26.960 --> 31:32.240
this is the blueprint this was the blueprint joe rogan was laying down for the musty and

31:32.240 --> 31:36.160
dusty podcast boys that's what it is these guys be honest you're gonna be talking to a good-looking

31:36.160 --> 31:39.520
girl but if you and the girl haven't had sex it doesn't matter what you're talking about

31:39.520 --> 31:45.520
does it not matter does it not matter I just want a nice girl to talk to about minecraft is that too

31:45.520 --> 31:50.960
much to ask is that too much to ask what if they just want to talk about the 1.19 update they just

31:50.960 --> 31:55.600
want to talk about the deep dark and how they they died fighting the warden that's I just your

31:55.600 --> 32:02.720
brain simply cannot be that much of a neanderthal it just it just can't right joe also that looks

32:02.720 --> 32:07.840
like a pizza is this not a pizza in the background got him hungry is all you're thinking while she's

32:07.840 --> 32:16.880
talking is donkey donkey donkey you know you have to save the world I don't know how we got into

32:16.880 --> 32:23.920
talking about donkey kong saving the world here Mario's trying to save peach from donkey kong

32:24.000 --> 32:29.680
and there's a floating pizza in the background and I don't understand any of it because I'm so

32:29.680 --> 32:35.680
hungry energize a rabbit run on your brain 24 hours a day go donkey donkey donkey still going donkey

32:35.680 --> 32:41.840
donkey donkey and on that note that has taken every ounce of energy out out of me these three

32:41.840 --> 32:48.160
comedy specials have simply drained me like the villain in sailor moon draining young girl's energy

32:48.160 --> 32:55.040
to keep her young that's me but these three men and um I can't say Amy Schumer is any better

32:55.040 --> 33:01.280
I didn't include her because I just couldn't bear I simply just couldn't bear the tampon jokes I just

33:01.280 --> 33:08.000
can't do it right now something else you can get for free tampons honestly someone will always hook

33:08.000 --> 33:14.720
