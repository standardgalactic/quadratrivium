0	4880	Have you ever been perusing Netflix and looking at all the comedy specials that you don't want to watch?
4880	10080	Until you inevitably try one out and realize how much of a waste of time it is because,
10080	13920	oh my god, this comedy special is made for someone 50 years older than me.
13920	17600	But then, in the 80s, he put the earring in his right ear where,
17600	19040	ELLEN SHOTS GAY!
19040	23040	That's not always a bad thing. Sometimes it's just not your taste.
23040	25120	Sometimes the content's just not made for you.
25120	28720	Sometimes you're just not the target demographic, which is what I tell my parents
28720	32480	when they watch my videos and they don't understand 90% of the references in them.
32480	35760	So I've already established that everyone's comedy taste is different,
35760	39200	and I know the title of this video, you might be like, oh goodness,
39200	43280	she's a snowflake comedy police coming after my favorite guy.
43280	44000	And you know what?
45600	46480	Yeah, kinda.
47040	47920	I'm just kidding.
47920	52400	I understand that comedy is comedy, and we can make comedy out of serious situations.
52400	53360	I really do.
53360	57200	I really don't think every single thing has to be inherently problematic,
57200	60080	and everything's a problem, and oh, cancel culture.
60800	66480	But I do know things age poorly, and sometimes people also age poorly, and so do their jokes.
66480	71520	There are a few comedy specials lately that have been buzzing everyone's cringe radar.
71520	73120	They've been off the charts.
73120	75360	The cringe meter has been breaking lately.
75360	77360	I need to call the mechanic and get that fixed.
77360	81680	The cringe meter was sounding the alarm, and like a fly to dog shit,
81680	86800	I was there to stick my grubby little hands on it and get in there and see what it's all about.
86800	89600	So I have three comedy specials I want to show you today.
89600	91920	And by show you, I mean cringe with you.
91920	96320	So the first one I want to show you today is this beautiful man, Jim Brewer.
97200	97680	Brewer?
100000	101440	I went to their stadium once.
101440	108480	You thought I was gonna say hardly no or hardly ever is that a good joke unless Curtis Conner says it.
108480	108960	That's it.
108960	112160	So I'm gonna be honest, I know nothing about this dude,
112240	115920	but oh boy, are the first six minutes of this comedy special,
115920	119760	everything I need to see, and the only thing I want to see from this dude.
120000	125760	Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the stage, Jim Brewer!
137760	142000	So we get this really lukewarm intro, and I really wish they like,
142000	146640	the editors took the time to actually put the song in the special instead of just the
146640	150000	recording of the sound going through a shitty microphone,
150000	151840	at going in whatever theater they're in.
151840	154160	So it's a little awkward, but it's fine.
154160	156320	This is how I was imagining it to go.
156320	161520	Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome your oomoo senpai, Jim Brewer!
161520	190320	So yeah, after the classic rock you'd play while you're out fishing with your buds,
190320	193520	he opens up with COVID humor.
195280	199280	This was published four days ago, July 2022.
199280	203760	So yeah, this is already not going to age well in about like yesterday.
203760	208160	And just from this intro, you can tell that this is a guy that goes to like the neighbor's
208160	213120	birthday party in like a suburban neighborhood and thinks he's fucking hilarious.
213120	215600	Oh, you can't say anything anymore.
216560	220160	We're risking our lives to be here.
234000	237760	At this part, I was about to damn near jump out of my chair and crawl under the bed,
237760	239360	because that took me by surprise.
239360	243440	The gain on that was just like plus 10 over what he had before.
246160	266320	So at this point, about 80% of this two minutes has just been him reenacting something.
266320	272560	You'll see that this is a common theme, actually so much so that somebody made a compilation video
272560	278640	of this special, but just the the unintelligible bits and there's a lot of it.
278640	285840	This is like 90% of his comedy is just over the top imitations of a person that doesn't exist in the world.
290560	291120	You hear that?
291120	296320	That's all of your grandpas and problematic uncles at every family gathering cheering for this guy.
296320	299440	The vaccinators, you were real cocky a couple of months ago.
300720	302080	We got vaccinated.
308880	312080	Got my second shot April 19th.
315920	320160	I can't get sick from the corona.
320160	321680	I'm vaccinated.
321680	322880	No one ever said that.
323440	324800	No one ever said that.
324880	326000	See this bucket of virus?
329200	330160	I'm vaccinated.
332800	334160	I'll even lick metal.
334160	335520	I'm not afraid of anything.
337760	344560	See, I told you it's just him unintelligibly reenacting something or someone that maybe one
344560	348640	person has said I would bet you one person thought that, but it's not true.
348640	354640	Not to be a anti-comedy Andy here, but no one ever said you couldn't get sick when you got
354800	360400	vaccinated or, um, I'm sorry, the schmackschismation is just something that would prevent you from
361280	364800	dying or going to the hospital in serious condition is all.
364800	365360	That's it.
365360	370960	That no one said it was gonna make you super man or iron man just battling the virus like
372240	376720	see let me take a let me take a page out of Jim Brewer hardly know where his book here and
376720	382240	and give you a taste of my own taste, my own flavor, my own adaptation of Jim Brewer's comedy.
382240	387440	No one's going out here in a fucking iron iron man suit after getting the schmackschismation
388000	388400	going.
392400	393680	Can't touch me now virus.
399120	400400	That's me in my Batmobile.
402880	404400	Just dodging all the viruses.
407840	408560	Are you laughing?
408560	409120	Thank you.
409120	410080	Thank you.
410080	412320	Yes, uh, that's comedy here.
412320	413840	I don't have to wear a mask.
416720	418560	That's exactly what I did.
418560	423200	As soon as I got my second vaccination, I went, I don't have to wear my mask.
426080	427120	I know this is a joke.
427120	433120	Okay, I obviously know he's not being completely serious, but this is rooted in some truth.
433120	438560	Like he actually kind of thinks this, you know, he at least says it to his buddies behind the scenes.
439120	440880	People vaccinated getting sick.
440880	441280	What?
443920	445440	You need a new booster.
445440	445920	What?
448960	450000	Who wants a shot?
450000	451520	Who wants to see a ball game?
459280	460320	Wave your flipper.
463280	464240	That's for you.
464240	465760	Go see the ball game.
465760	467840	Who wants, who wants to work again?
469120	470320	Who wants to work again?
470320	482080	I have no idea where this comparison even came from.
482080	484560	I had watched this before and I didn't get it.
484560	486160	And I thought upon rewatching it.
486160	489520	I would understand how like, I don't even know who he's imitating.
489520	491120	Is he, are we seals?
491120	494480	Are we seals for, for getting the schmackschismation?
494480	495440	Is that what it is?
495440	496640	Are we just play seals?
496640	500640	Is the point that we just like go along with whatever the authorities are saying?
500640	503360	Is that, is that that I don't understand?
503920	504880	What's in the shot?
504880	505680	It's safe.
505680	506320	Don't worry.
507440	508160	Don't worry.
509200	511200	The ingredients are on the website.
511200	511840	Trust me.
511840	517120	I, I looked up so many, so many different sources for what's in it.
517120	518080	You know, it's new.
518080	518880	It's brand new.
518880	520080	It was coming out really fast.
520080	521600	It was a stressful time.
521600	524240	A lot of friends that I had were nervous about getting the shot,
524240	525600	even though they're, they're for it.
525600	527040	I just, I'm so confused.
527040	531760	So yeah, I've, I looked up extensively what was in it and I can confirm that it is safe.
532400	533280	I didn't die.
533280	533840	I'm here.
534800	535520	I'm good.
535520	541120	I'm confused what the purpose of this is in the, in the good big year of 2022.
541120	543600	You know, like we've, we've gone through this.
543600	545840	Like, I don't feel like getting into this.
545840	556560	I, I mean, when I take all the steps back, I feel like this is going to be a Broadway
556560	557840	play in three years.
560080	560880	You know what I mean?
560880	561360	Like, wait.
568880	570080	Six foot safe.
575840	581600	Don't shoot distance six foot safe.
581600	584800	This bit goes on for way too long.
584800	590480	And I hope by now you can understand why I couldn't stomach to watch any more of this
590480	595280	entire hour long special because I bet you it's, it's more of this.
595280	599200	It's a lot more of this where he's just reenacting something.
599200	601120	That's the whole comedy.
601120	602880	Can we switch it up a little bit?
606400	618960	Like the bit is dead at this point and he just keeps going, keeps killing it.
618960	623680	And you know, they say if you can't, if you can't beat them, join them.
623680	624480	So let's do that.
636560	640080	I'm the grand ma killer.
646800	648080	Six foot safe.
648800	651360	Yeah, six foot safe.
651920	653360	It's not even a good show too.
653360	655440	And like, I can't even build off of that.
655440	656720	Six foot safe.
657680	661120	How am I going to know if it's okay?
661200	665520	How do I know if I can see Aunt Linda today?
666720	668080	Well, I don't know.
669040	672480	I don't know who's gonna show me.
673600	676400	Who's gonna show me how.
676400	686400	And we have to cover our face in the name of grace just to feel disconnected.
687200	691360	Aunt Linda, when am I gonna see you?
692720	702560	Hopefully in a year or two, I can see you and Uncle Jim too.
705120	709440	Curtains close and that's the end of the first musical number.
709840	712080	Scene two opens.
712880	716800	Crazy Uncle Jim Brewer sitting at the family dining table.
716800	718400	No mask alone.
718400	719440	One chair apart.
720240	722800	The family sitting at the rest of the table.
722800	724000	Disappointed.
724000	725600	Listen to the rules.
729840	731200	Here come the governors.
735760	738240	We have no laws and regulations.
739440	752160	We shall determine who is essential.
752160	756880	So at first I thought he was trying to do this like really horrible Chinese accent.
757920	764400	And then I realized it's actually a horrible German accent and he's equating the American
764400	772960	government to a point in history where things got a little crazy.
774880	779520	I know jokes are supposed to be exaggerations but it's just not even funny.
781840	786640	Because the whole bit is just him pacing around making a silly face.
786640	791680	It's like he watched one Dane Cook special in 2008 and was like this.
791680	793600	This is the pinnacle of comedy.
795280	803360	Don't get me wrong I I that's actually that's the whole problem.
803360	808000	I used to like Dane Cook's comedy and you know what else I was also like 10.
808640	811840	So that about says everything you need to know.
811840	816320	It's comedy from 12 years ago and it should stay there.
816320	817840	It was good for its time.
817840	820720	You could leave it just leave it in 2008.
820720	828640	We shall determine who may go at your house and who shall have a muffin.
836000	846240	And remember if you see any children playing ooms outside together report them and their parents.
846240	850240	This is for your safety.
854240	856800	See the bit just goes on for too long.
856800	862400	I also am interested to know what the age range of this theater happens to be.
862400	868800	If we got a glimpse of the audience and what I wonder I just wonder that's all I'm just wondering.
869040	881360	Okay that's it that's eight stop stop two there's two I have I have I've had enough of this bit.
881360	886320	Okay so you've seen all that right that was the first like that was only six and a half minutes.
886320	893360	It felt like 30 and if there was that much like reenactment in just those six minutes
893360	897200	of him like exaggerating and overreacting check this out.
897200	900960	This is Jim Brewer's stand-up comedy but only the unintelligible parts.
900960	902720	I recommend you watch this for yourself.
902720	904880	I'll link this video in the description below.
904880	907600	I'll only show you a little bit.
927440	936000	So that's just 30 seconds of it.
936000	942320	This compilation is eight minutes long and I know for a fact that there's more of it.
942320	946000	I know for a fact this person didn't even get all of the clips.
946000	949200	So that's about all I could handle for this portion of the video.
949200	953680	The next comedian I want to cover here is Brendan Schaub and I know other people have
953680	959600	talked about him and he's actually the most recurring guest on the Joe Rogan podcast albeit
959600	964480	I think they're more of the older episodes that he was on and he also used to be a
964480	966000	MMA question mark fighter.
966000	967440	Yeah he does MMA.
967440	969280	He does Brazilian Jiu Jitsu.
969280	971920	He also has like three different podcasts.
971920	973680	The Fighter and the Kid podcast.
973680	976400	The Below the Belt with Brendan Schaub podcast.
976400	981040	And co-host of the King and Sting podcast with another comedian Theo Vaughn.
981040	983280	The mullet guy you've probably seen clips of him.
983280	988560	So considering that Joe Rogan also went from the UFC to comedy to podcasting.
988560	991280	I'm here looking for guys to suck my dick and there's nothing.
991280	996320	It seems Brendan Schaub wanted to follow in his daddy's footsteps and do the same thing.
996320	1000320	And you know from what I understand here not everyone can be good at everything.
1000320	1005360	Okay I'm not sitting here expecting these people to be like the best comedians on the planet.
1005360	1008800	Sometimes you're gonna make something and it's gonna flop and it's gonna kind of suck.
1008800	1010880	Okay that's just the nature of things.
1010880	1013200	We all have our flop era whether we like it or not.
1013200	1014320	That's just human nature.
1014320	1015760	It's nothing to be ashamed of.
1015760	1020960	Unfortunately Brendan Schaub's flop era also includes um bad racist comedy.
1020960	1022480	But we'll get to that in a second.
1022480	1026400	So Brendan Schaub's special is 25 minutes long.
1026400	1030240	Posted on the Thick Boy channel with three C's.
1030240	1032240	Granted he's almost 40 but it's fine.
1032240	1034800	The special is called the Gringo Poppy.
1034800	1040560	So you see the branding here is already a little um Mexican and um no.
1040560	1041680	He's not Mexican.
1042320	1043200	His wife is.
1043200	1046960	And you can see by the dislike ratio that this was not received very well.
1047600	1073840	So this is already starting off better than Jim Brewer's uh where they actually overlaid
1073840	1078240	the song that was playing correctly over the special before he gets on stage.
1078240	1079920	So Brownie points there.
1079920	1084000	I also believe this is an original song made specifically for this and um
1084000	1085200	It goes hard as fuck.
1085200	1086960	Thick boy squad.
1086960	1089120	Thick boy nation.
1089120	1091680	You can catch that cover on my second channel.
1091680	1097840	So we have this really sad kind of middle school play set here of a city skyline made
1097840	1100000	with like poster paper from Michaels.
1100000	1100720	You know it's fine.
1100720	1101360	It's fine.
1101360	1103840	You got to make do with what you have.
1103840	1104160	Okay.
1105120	1107200	What's up Dallas?
1112640	1114800	Look at you guys.
1115760	1116880	I'm not used to this.
1116880	1117920	Dallas a little different.
1117920	1120000	There are some ladies in the crowd tonight.
1121520	1122640	I am not used to that.
1125280	1128000	They don't have women where you're from.
1128000	1132000	It's also pretty funny that this is Texas because you have this guy on the left here
1132000	1133840	with a don't tread on me sweater.
1133840	1135920	My demo 18 to 36 bros.
1135920	1139440	That's that's what I specialize in.
1139440	1142240	Sure I won't argue with that demographic.
1142240	1143680	Are we vaccinated up in here Dallas?
1143680	1144560	Everybody vaccinated?
1146880	1151200	I don't know why these people keep bringing up COVID in their comedy specials in the good
1151200	1154800	year of 2022 but I'm gonna be honest I'm sick of hearing it.
1154800	1156080	Can we please stop?
1156720	1158640	Please talk about something else.
1158640	1161280	I'm here to laugh, not be sad.
1161280	1162240	There's always one guy.
1162240	1163520	No fucking way bro.
1169680	1172000	That needle's not touching this fucking temple daddy.
1175040	1177600	As he says that he's taking a nacho dip in a nacho cheese.
1180640	1182560	Oh my bad Mr. Whole Foods.
1183200	1189600	So what Brandon's trying to do here is do a little bit of crowd work which is when a
1189600	1196400	comedian you know picks on people in the crowd and um man it doesn't go very well and I feel
1196400	1201200	like people are really hard on this guy and hard on all these comedians really.
1201200	1206080	Not that they don't deserve to be grilled a little bit but it is really difficult.
1206080	1211120	It's not something that is easy to do and they're just bad at it because they're dumb.
1211120	1216000	Like it's really difficult and hard to master especially if you're new at comedy which I think
1216000	1221760	Brandon's job is new at least at stand-up but that doesn't mean that it's immune from cringe
1221760	1223200	and it's a little cringe.
1223200	1228480	Like he just made up a guy and like we did not see maybe it's because we weren't there but
1228480	1231920	we did not see any guy that was like no fucking way bro.
1231920	1235760	This needle ain't touching this daddy temple or whatever the fuck he said.
1235760	1240160	This whole vaccination stuff I'm not anti-vaxx man I'm vaccinated but it's uh.
1240160	1243440	I don't care I'm gonna move on to the juicy part.
1243440	1246160	I'm married to Mexican y'all I'm married to Mexican.
1246160	1251920	And that is why it's called the gringo poppy because I'm married to Mexican.
1251920	1256720	Dallas I don't mean like Taco Bell Mexican no no no I'm talking Guadalajara.
1258000	1262080	Born and raised came to the states 10 years ago illegally Mexican.
1264560	1266880	What is a Taco Bell Mexican Brandon?
1266880	1268640	What is a Taco Bell Mexican?
1268640	1274320	I um what I am interpreting this statement as is there are.
1276800	1282480	It's like if we said oh this is a this isn't a a Walmart white person.
1282480	1288560	This is a Crayton Barrel white person because that's that's the vibe that I'm getting from this.
1289200	1292640	So we're already putting Mexicans down in kind of a weird way.
1293600	1296720	You can bring your wife up without insulting other people.
1296720	1302000	I forget this one of my boys goes dude dude poppy what are you doing bro get with a Latina
1302000	1307360	bro you know why because they're fun and they're spicy no doubt definitely spicy
1307360	1312880	girl spicy right girl spicy you know what spicy means they're assholes that's what that means.
1317040	1321680	We love the stereotypical sassy mean Latina.
1322000	1327600	Seven nights a week I'm not used to this I was like what the heat is every Wednesday fuck yeah
1329760	1335040	no dumb ass up the heat is every Wednesday real Mexican dishes y'all real shit from the motherland
1335040	1337760	I'm talking Wavos Ventil
1337760	1339760	Yo
1353120	1360960	Yeah so that's that's the comedy here um boy you can do self deprecating humor like this uh
1360960	1364800	just because you talk about another race doesn't mean it's inherently racist you can
1365280	1372800	believe it or not joke about other races without being racist but this is not it this is not it
1372800	1377440	I guess it just seems like cringy and stupid like I don't know how else to describe it
1377440	1383120	dude I did that 23 and me I did that shit you spin the cup email your DNA in I did that
1383120	1387920	they sent me drive mayonnaise back I am white as shit Dallas yeah
1388320	1393040	yeah my person handout page seven bitch I need a fucking tater tot once a week
1395680	1398160	with a fucking hot pocket kill you every now and then
1400320	1404480	every time dinner we come I'm like oh does she really think beans go with every goddamn mail
1404480	1410160	she's serious so like sometimes it is fun to joke about and see the differences between our culture
1410160	1416160	and someone else's especially when you're married to that person but when you take that person's
1416160	1422880	culture and then make it your aesthetic and identity it's a little weird I can only speak
1422880	1428880	from personal experience but I've seen when um specifically white people will date someone
1428880	1436320	who's Asian and then they think that gives them a pass to like be an honorary asian you're not
1437040	1443200	you're not you that doesn't mean you can use stereotypically asian imagery and scenery and
1443200	1448240	you're like your aesthetics and the way you dress and do your makeup so you look more asian
1448240	1453120	to make their eyes look longer and look more asian it's okay if you learn another language
1453120	1456800	because of your significant other I think that's really sweet I think that's cool I don't know
1456800	1461600	how to put like a hard line in the sand of when it gets weird but sometimes it's weird sometimes
1461600	1466240	it just gets weird every time dinner come like does it ever occur to her maybe Brennan's not
1466240	1475440	trying to shit his pants tonight how about that all right so we've hit mainly stereotypes so far
1475440	1482800	Mexican food spicy Mexican food hard to pronounce oh they have beans a lot Taco Bell all the hard
1482880	1487120	hitters there every time dinner would come my asshole go like this
1491360	1498320	we're dying down here puppy it's so spicy bro I've never been thicker since I got with a
1498320	1506880	Mexican man thick with three fucking seas he said the thing he said the thing he said the thing
1506880	1510880	everything they eat bean cheese bean cheese bean cheese bean cheese like the hell man
1510880	1516320	we're just gonna carb load year-round we never tailor off the carbs that's a game plan beans and
1516320	1521360	cheese aren't particularly known for their carbs but go off I walk in the house last Friday
1522160	1527200	show enough there's a fucking fiesta my favorite food you know how like feel von
1527200	1538960	can brown cocaine you know how like he struggles with cocaine like if there was cocaine on the
1539040	1544000	table right now he'd fucking snort it from right field you feel me god bless him I love that
1544000	1550400	fucking dude that's I am with fucking plus only I came out of nowhere and on that note
1551040	1557040	basically TLDR when comedy relies on purely just stereotypes of another race it's just not that
1557040	1562480	funny I really don't think he's actually racist and I really do think he loves his Mexican wife
1562480	1567280	and he loves the food and he loves the culture I really do believe that I just think the execution
1567280	1574080	of this special with these jokes maybe not the best representation of that because there is a
1574080	1579280	way where you could possibly do that while still showing that you're endearing and you love you
1579280	1585200	love this culture and but still making some funny jokes about it but this was not that
1585200	1591840	unfortunately it was neither endearing nor funny so with that I want to show you the last comedy
1591840	1599840	special which is you know him you know him as the host of fear factor oh you didn't mean either
1599840	1606880	because I completely did not recognize him with hair I know Joe Rogan has a 2019 comedy special
1606880	1612160	and I watched the beginning of it and it wasn't terrible I firmly believe that you can dislike
1612160	1618160	someone or you can like someone but still criticize the piece of media as it is you know you can not
1618160	1623600	like Joe Rogan that much which I kind of don't but that doesn't mean everything he does is
1623600	1628320	automatically going to be unfunny and terrible because you know he's a fully dimensional person
1628320	1634640	as as are we all then again I did not watch the rest of this hour and 15 minutes of this 2019
1634640	1639120	comedy special so hopefully there's not anything in there that I would want to take back that statement
1639120	1644880	for um and uh yeah I wrote this down a unicorn is a donkey from the future
1647840	1652800	what the fuck does that mean it means you need to stop smoking so much weed stupid
1652800	1658800	yep pretty good anyway if you didn't know that he's actually been doing stand up for a long ass time
1658800	1665680	actually since 1994 and I did not know people were still alive back then so I want to watch a
1665680	1671520	little bit of that with you because oh boy when I talk about humor that didn't age well
1672240	1676880	this is it tonight show features the comedy of Joe Rogan
1678720	1684960	holy shit these graphics dude I don't know exactly when this specific special was but I can
1684960	1688720	probably safely say from these graphics this is from the 90s
1695680	1700640	this is ronda shear no I don't know who she is and I'm not going to tell you
1701680	1707280	but I do love her hair I've been trying to achieve this style and I do not know how because I do
1707280	1712320	not own a blow dryer so that's all I wanted to add to this little bit and let's hear it Mark one more
1712320	1721600	time for the spotlight cafe I also just want to point out that this person on the left here is
1721600	1727200	playing a key tar first of all coolest shit but also the cherry on top is that they're wearing
1727200	1731920	sunglasses with it I want to be their friend anyway you ready to meet your first act this evening
1731920	1740960	you look hot you look ready oh I look hot well

1749280	1755280	where did this outfit change come from holy shit she just introduced the show and then go back
1755280	1761120	and change or did she just rip it off like she looks like she's ready for a wwe match she's about
1761120	1767520	to damn near jump in the ring here for double cage match featuring Logan Paul I know things about
1767520	1774560	wrestling put your hands together from Mr. Joe Rogan so enough of the dilly dallying here we're
1774560	1782000	finally introduced to Joe Rogan from almost 30 years ago
1782000	1793440	so
1800320	1807200	so yeah that immediately immediately didn't age well what an introduction these sideburns
1807440	1813120	killing me too and yeah his voice is like it's like you know that the spirit of Joe Rogan is
1813120	1818480	in there but I can't find him it's like the spirit of Joe Rogan has overtaken this young man
1818480	1822320	having a rough week man I've been here the m word too much for my girlfriend and I'm talking
1822320	1826560	about she brings up marriage a little bit too much and it's uh I can't even hear that word hear
1826560	1831120	the word marriage my brain just shuts off it's like marriage click everyone after marriage is
1837280	1843520	I'm like that's that's like a contract I sign this I can't have sex with other girls for the
1843520	1851600	rest of my life and I gotta buy you a ring yeah it's everything you ever wanted this to be

1876960	1880720	because you don't have testosterone that's the big thing you don't have to donkey donkey juice so
1880720	1886960	you can't appreciate the way guys act okay so now we're into like alpha male podcaster territory
1886960	1892240	this is the blueprint this was the blueprint joe rogan was laying down for the musty and
1892240	1896160	dusty podcast boys that's what it is these guys be honest you're gonna be talking to a good-looking
1896160	1899520	girl but if you and the girl haven't had sex it doesn't matter what you're talking about
1899520	1905520	does it not matter does it not matter I just want a nice girl to talk to about minecraft is that too
1905520	1910960	much to ask is that too much to ask what if they just want to talk about the 1.19 update they just
1910960	1915600	want to talk about the deep dark and how they they died fighting the warden that's I just your
1915600	1922720	brain simply cannot be that much of a neanderthal it just it just can't right joe also that looks
1922720	1927840	like a pizza is this not a pizza in the background got him hungry is all you're thinking while she's

1968160	1975040	to keep her young that's me but these three men and um I can't say Amy Schumer is any better
1975040	1981280	I didn't include her because I just couldn't bear I simply just couldn't bear the tampon jokes I just
