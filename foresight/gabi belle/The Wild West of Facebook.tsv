0	5000	Every few years, I make the mistake of wanting to do some spring cleaning and sell some second-hand goods.
5000	9400	And what's a better place to sell second-hand goods than Facebook Marketplace?
9400	17100	With eBay, you have to deal with shipping and with Craigslist, you have to deal with not getting kidnapped, so Facebook Marketplace, it is.
17100	19500	But the last time I did that, I...
19500	27300	From old lady scammers to obsessive weirdos that made me feel unsafe, to people just straight-up making fun of me.
27300	34600	The amount of times people ask me to call them on Facebook Marketplace is an introvert's worst nightmare.
34600	38100	Do you want the ring light or not? It's 10 bucks.
38100	42300	You don't need to call me. Why do you need to call me?
42300	48500	Ran into old lady scammers and people would not stop wanting to call me to this day.
48500	53300	I don't know why people want to talk on the phone so bad on Facebook Marketplace.
53300	55900	Like, what is that conversation going to be like?
55900	57900	Hi. Hi. Do you want the thing?
57900	59200	Yes. Okay.
59200	60100	Does it work?
60100	60700	Yes.
60700	61600	Can I come now?
61600	62200	Yes.
62200	63300	Okay.
63300	65900	Okay.
65900	69000	This could have been a three-text conversation.
69000	69800	Yes.
69800	75700	There's one interaction I'm still mad about where I was selling this big piece of wooden furniture for $60.
75700	81500	And the lady couldn't find my apartment building in the apartment complex even though I gave her clear instructions,
81500	85700	and then got mad and tried to give me $20 for the thing.
85700	87900	Because she couldn't find my apartment.
87900	91300	But at that point, I had already brought it down to the first floor.
91300	93700	Like, I was outside with it for her.
93700	98100	So I ended up giving it to her for $40 because she kept bullying me in real life.
98100	99700	I'll never forgive you, Dolores.
99700	102300	You caused much delor in my ass.
102300	108300	So Facebook Marketplace itself is its own rabbit hole of a video that you can watch after this if you want.
108300	110700	But I'm here to talk about the rest of Facebook.
110700	111300	Why?
111300	114600	Well, my original intention was to sell stuff on Marketplace.
114600	117200	But where I ended up was somewhere else.
117200	121500	I logged in and started scrolling and saw some of the most absurd shit
121500	125900	that you will never get served on Instagram or TikTok or TwitterX.
125900	131700	On those websites, you get a curated feed that the algorithm feeds you to eat up, yum, yum, yum.
131700	135100	Tasty little treats that the algorithm knows that you like seeing,
135100	139900	or ones that will get your engagement because a lot of the ones on Twitter just like piss you off.
139900	142800	It learns what you think is funny, cute, yummy,
142800	145100	and you get more and more of what you interact with.
145100	148200	On Facebook, since I made one and never touched it,
148200	150900	Facebook has no idea who I am.
150900	154400	So the default feed that they show you is a mess.
154400	158900	Cat Williams leaks video of Tyler Perry's freak off with Kevin Hart.
158900	159900	Video is below.
159900	164800	This was posted by King of Cinema where they just post tabloid-esque news.
164800	169800	They can put any pictures up and do whatever and people believe everything on here.
169800	170400	Wow.
170400	173500	Question what's going to happen to Kevin or anyone else?
173500	174300	I'll wait.
174300	175300	Damn right, Teresa.
175300	177700	Good to see some level-headed individuals on here.
177700	181400	I'm afraid to click on this link like I'm guaranteed to get a virus.
181400	185700	There are plenty of tabloid-type pages that thrive on Facebook these days.
185700	189900	The last time most of us left Facebook, our impression of it was like,
189900	195300	mothers who post questionably aggressive minion memes with the guys of being playful.
195300	197300	But in reality, they're on the edge.
197300	200000	They need to whine and whine if you know what I mean.
200000	202800	Like the personification of...
202800	204600	I love cooking with wine.
204600	207100	Sometimes I even put it in the food.
209900	212300	If I managed to survive the rest of the week,
212300	217800	I would like my straight jacket to be hot pink and my helmet to sparkle.
217800	221000	If stress burned calories, I'd be a supermodel.
221000	222400	Vai faire la sombra.
222400	224200	Merde no sol santa.
224200	225100	What does that mean?
225900	236400	Dear haters, I didn't help but notice that awesome ends with me and ugly starts with you.
236400	240200	Putting down your phone and paying attention to those talking to you,
240200	241600	there's an app for that.
241600	243700	It's called Respect.
243700	245100	My kids don't talk to me anymore.
245100	249100	But now Facebook is still that, but more.
249100	252000	We got Ariana Grande and her ex-husband.
252000	253900	Hashtag boom challenge.
253900	259200	Upon clicking the hashtag, we can decipher exactly what hashtag boom challenge is.
259200	262200	So, so far, we have Ariana Grande and her ex-husband.
262200	268100	We have Sylvester Stallone and his daughter from the page called Teaching English.
273100	274100	Where'd she go?
274100	275800	Don't scare me like that, Sylvester.
275800	279300	And under it, we have this video from the page FastVideos.
279300	281100	Hashtag boom challenge.
281100	283600	Why is he putting boots in the...
283600	287000	Okay, trust the process, trust the process.
287000	290200	Okay, we're wrapping it with string.
293200	295200	Okay, I wonder what he's making.
295200	296800	What is he making?
296800	299000	I mean, this is pretty sick, but like, what is he doing?
305700	307200	I guess we'll never find out.
307200	308600	The video just ends.
308600	312400	First of all, FastVideos feels like false advertising
312400	314600	because that felt like an eternity.
314600	316900	And then I got punished for watching it all.
316900	318600	I want my 60 seconds back.
318600	320200	I still don't know what he was doing.
320200	323400	Part three, hashtag movie, hashtag boom challenge.
323400	326000	This is just a scene from the hit movie.
332600	334400	The Suicide Squad.
334400	337800	Is this person just uploading the entire movie to Facebook
337800	341100	in four by five cropped aspect ratio
341100	344600	with black bars on the top and bottom in parts?
344600	348000	This is like some 2005 YouTube stuff.
348000	352600	Safe to say, I know exactly what the hashtag boom challenge is now.
355100	358700	The rest of my feed was just a lot of Beyonce and her family.
358700	359600	Go blue.
361300	363400	I'm pretty sure she's wearing orange.
364400	371600	We have the most hilarious photo shop of Paul Walker ever.
371600	372200	R.A.P.
372200	374900	But at least we got the Wiz Khalifa song out of it.
376500	379500	So one genre of video that's really popular on Facebook,
379500	382200	or at least was, are the ones where someone is supposed to get
382200	385800	surprised with something like a proposal or a boyfriend back
385800	387400	home from military stuff.
387400	391500	But the video is padded with like 10 minutes of nothing happening
391500	394300	and it's like the worst staged thing ever.
394300	396500	Rolling, action.
396500	400200	Pay no mind to the person yelling, rolling, action
400200	402300	in the beginning of this video and you'll see why.
405000	406100	Ew.
406100	407500	Why was that in your mouth?
407500	409600	So he's going to put it in the strawberry.
416800	420100	No one will ever see him there with that.
422500	425700	So now they're calling the girl over who's going to get proposed
425700	429200	to good thing that they yelled rolling action in the beginning
429200	432200	of this rolling action.
432200	432700	Oh my gosh.
432700	433400	What is this?
433400	434600	Your man.
434600	436600	He sent this over for you.
436600	437400	Oh my God.
437400	438600	It's amazing.
440100	441900	She doesn't know.
445100	446200	Can he breathe?
446200	447300	He's a Madagascar.
447900	451700	She doesn't even see the ring clearly in the strawberry.
451700	453300	How does she not see him?
453300	455100	This is crazy.
455100	456900	I think he's actually here.
456900	457500	Yeah.
457500	458400	I think he's here.
458400	459600	I think he might be here.
459600	460300	I think he might be here.
460300	461300	Oh my God.
461300	463500	She found the ring.
463500	465000	It's a ring.
465000	465900	A ring.
465900	469500	This girl has the observational skills of Dora the Explorer.
469500	472500	It's like part of the reason I stopped watching the show as
472500	473100	an eight-year-old.
473100	474700	It was infuriating.
475100	475700	Look.
477700	479100	What does that say?
479100	480300	Remove the rose.
480300	484700	Remove the rose there because there is a very special surprise.
492900	495600	I mean the acting from the friend there is just top tier.
495600	500200	I mean Navy boyfriend surprises pregnant girlfriend and proposed.
500200	502400	They're like combining everything in this one.
502400	504400	They are expecting a baby.
505200	507800	It's the guy from the last video.
507800	510900	Her boyfriend has been gone for three years.
512600	518600	Now he's taking over the ultrasound and that's definitely plugged in and real.
518600	521700	They about to know the gender of the baby.
521700	524300	He's crying of happiness.
524300	529000	She definitely cannot see him out of the peripherals of her eyes.
529000	531600	I actually have another surprise for you.
531600	532600	What?
532600	535300	So the reason I'm filming is to your left.
538300	539300	No way.
539300	540800	Oh my God.
540800	542400	It's been so long.
542400	546900	It's been so long and I know I've been overseas and we're having a baby girl.
546900	551900	I don't want to spend another day not knowing you know my wife.
551900	552900	Would you marry me?
552900	553700	Of course.
553700	554400	Really?
554400	555800	Yes, of course.
556800	558000	Oh my gosh.
558800	560900	Are we having a baby girl?
562700	563900	Oh my God.
568300	569300	Hold on.
569300	572800	He's been gone for three years and she's pregnant.
573800	578500	That might have been what they were baiting, but it didn't work because the only comment
578500	581600	is congratulations to you and your families.
581600	582400	Thank you, Barb.
582400	586900	When she sees him, military husband surprise homecoming.
586900	589900	This one has 70,000 likes in this one.
589900	595200	He loves doing this thing every like 10 seconds where he shushes us as if we're going to tell her.
600200	602900	Oh, and now he's doing the thing where he takes over.
602900	608700	If someone was just standing there filming me like this for 15 minutes during my appointment,
608700	610200	I would be weirded out.
615000	616700	I was doing the whole thing.
617200	618100	I was doing it.
620600	627600	I'm so glad I waited 15 minutes to watch the last 20 seconds of this video.
627600	632400	Can you imagine if the first like 20 minutes of my videos were just me like setting up
632400	634200	and I just left it all in?
650700	652500	Hey, guys, and welcome to another episode.
652500	656100	The reason they do this instead of just posting the last 10 seconds of the video
656100	660500	is to increase the watch time, which means more ads, which means more money.
660500	662300	They do this on Snapchat too.
662300	667100	This reminds me of that one video I made where they spend 10 minutes burning sprinkles
667100	671800	and eggs in a waffle iron only for it to come out looking like this.
671800	675600	But I want to show you the reason I wanted to make this video because I found the most
675600	680300	insane conglomeration of celebrity tabloid stretching the video out.
680300	683300	The most confusing video I've ever seen.
683300	687300	Zac Efron failed in his latest millionaire project.
687300	690700	Ah, yes, the failed celebrity, Zac Efron.
690700	695600	They basically made up this entire narrative that Zac Efron is devastated
695600	699100	and now his career has plummeted and he's in turmoil.
699100	704000	And today with his intervened face, his career is coming to an end.
704000	707000	The high school musical actor is devastated.
707000	712700	For years, he had to deal with horrible rumors about his swollen face due to bad surgery.
712700	716300	You had to recently dispel rumors that you had undergone plastic surgery.
716300	717800	You actually experienced it.
717800	720600	But the truth was different.
720600	726500	He was found on the floor of his house after a terrible domestic accident.
726500	729600	His jaw was dislocated.
729600	732200	But the public only cared about how he looked.
732200	734800	That's why his new project failed.
734800	740600	His new project failed because he was ugly and the public only cared about that.
740600	746400	As if that wasn't enough, another image of the actor with grotesque muscles went viral.
746400	749200	He became the laughing stock again.
749200	751400	Everyone hates Zac Efron.
751400	756200	But after all the hype surrounding his face, he had to speak up.
756200	760400	After the traumatic accident,
760400	764000	Efron's career declined.
764000	771800	But the trip to Australia to film his failed show wasn't in vain because Zac found a love at a cafe.
771800	775800	He met a 25-year-old waitress who stole his heart.
775800	778100	She was everything he was looking for.
778100	782400	She seemed to be the right one for him.
782400	786600	She was a normal and down-to-earth woman.
786600	795000	But it seems Vanessa had other intentions and would break Efron's heart again.
795000	798300	After 10 months, Vanessa betrayed him.
798300	802400	She was tempted by the fame and Zac lost control.
802400	810200	He kicked her off the set of his series, ending the idyllic romance.
810200	814200	Zac discovered that Valadarys had other intentions.
814200	821900	She was tempted by fame and money and accepted a contract to participate in a controversial reality show.
821900	823500	Why are we talking about her now?
823500	828300	There are more twists and turns in this video than there are on an average road in Massachusetts.
828300	832000	But upon his return, Zac worried his fans again.
832000	836700	New images with a bulked physique put him in the spotlight once again.
836700	840000	But this time, he went overboard at the gym.
840000	843600	And just a few months, he completely transformed.
843600	846400	And looks like a different person.
846400	849800	But this time, it's all due to a new project.
849800	850600	Woo!
850600	856000	Zac plays the wrestler Kevin Von Erich for the movie The Iron Claw.
856000	857300	God, he had me worried there.
857300	859500	That was another big twist twist in this video.
859500	860100	I got worried.
860100	862800	Imagine if someone made this, but it's about your life.
862800	866400	Gabby Bell failed in her latest millionaire project.
866400	871900	And today, with her intervened face, her career is coming to an end.
871900	882000	Because her fans keep saying she looks like Michael Reeves, another YouTuber on youtube.com.
882000	886800	The young star is devastated and shares a birthday with Usher.
886800	889300	Reminds me of these videos that are like,
889300	892000	Mr. Beast is dying very soon.
892000	895000	Mr. Beast has a condition called Crohn's disease.
895000	896700	Mr. Beast could die from this.
896700	902200	I'm so glad I could finally show someone that video because I reference it at least three times a week.
902200	906700	Because there's a response video to that from what might be the same guy.
906700	908800	Mr. Beast is not dying.
908800	914100	A YouTuber just claimed Mr. Beast will pass away soon because he has Crohn's disease.
914100	916800	Mr. Beast is dying very soon.
916800	919800	Mr. Beast has a condition called Crohn's disease.
919800	921500	Mr. Beast could die from this.
921500	925400	Mr. Beast does have this disease, but it's very rarely fatal
925400	928700	and he definitely won't pass away from it anytime soon.
928700	932900	Lying about Mr. Beast dying for views is honestly disgusting.
933700	939100	But before we get into the even wilder stuff I found on Facebook, which is no one's surprise,
939100	942500	you might end up wanting to sign up for the sponsor of today's video, Aura.
942500	947700	Aura is an online privacy tool with a multitude of resources like password manager, VPN,
947700	949600	credit locking, and fraud monitoring.
949600	953400	Just the other day, there was a breach that involved my email on a website
953400	956100	and it notified me and I changed my password immediately.
956100	959800	For those of you that use the same password for everything, this is why you shouldn't.
959800	962800	Don't do that. Use a password manager genuinely.
962800	966700	I was also doing some fun stuff where a company had to soft check my credit report
966700	969700	and even after unlocking it Aura notified me immediately
969700	971800	before it was even approved by the company.
971800	974700	It's a pretty cool tool and I've been using it for a few years now
974700	978000	and I've forced my entire family to be on the family plan and it's great.
978000	980600	If you're interested, you can get two weeks for free using my link.
980600	984300	It's aura.com slash Gabby Bell or you can scan the QR code on the screen
984300	986100	or the link is in the description below.
986100	987300	Thanks to Aura for sponsoring.
987300	990200	Checking out the sponsor really helps the channel and be safe out there
990200	994500	because especially on Facebook because this is about to get wild.
994500	998100	Now, that was just my initial scroll as I was laying on the ground
998100	1002200	procrastinating my plunge into the toilet of Facebook Marketplace.
1002200	1006000	But upon spending the most time on Facebook that I have since 2016,
1006000	1009100	I thought joining a bunch of mom groups would be hilarious
1009100	1012000	to see whatever shenanigans they were talking about in there.
1012000	1016700	But instead, I logged on later to continue my rediscovery of making Facebook
1016700	1020900	part of my daily routine and the first thing I was assaulted with
1020900	1025900	was a carousel of the most disgusting pictures of a child's foot
1025900	1032700	with a giant piece of foot crust in the shape and color of a Pringle peeled off his foot.
1032700	1035900	No sensor warning, no slash spoiler.
1035900	1041100	Even Instagram, also a meta company has built a feature that it will blur images
1041100	1042600	it thinks are explicit.
1042600	1045900	But this was an uncensored attack on my eyes.
1045900	1049500	I didn't even think to look at the comments because I just immediately left the group.
1049500	1051400	I saw one image and left.
1053500	1059000	So I gave up on that idea and I started scrolling through the popular public group suggestions
1059000	1064300	and found groups like chickens, chickens, chickens, which contained photos of chickens and eggs.
1064300	1065000	8 out of 10.
1065000	1067200	I'm high and this is Sardu Valley.
1067200	1069800	5 out of 10 cute posts but not enough drama.
1069800	1074200	There's also frog posting a Facebook group where you post frog content.
1074200	1075200	I got what I came for.
1075200	1075800	9 out of 10.
1075800	1078700	Plunging into the depths of Facebook group hell,
1078700	1082000	I came to this conclusion about young people who still use Facebook.
1082000	1086200	I know everyone was wondering this and I'm here to dispel the rumors and give you the facts.
1086200	1090700	It feels like there are four types of people under 30 who still use Facebook actively.
1090700	1093400	And it's either to cross post your LinkedIn posts,
1093400	1096300	you're using it ironically and are in shit posting groups,
1096300	1098300	you're an edge lord from 2016,
1098300	1100500	or you're in frog spotting.
1100500	1103800	Isn't that just all social media now?
1103800	1105700	Like it's all like that.
1105700	1108500	It hasn't changed.
1108500	1110500	Baddies in relationships.
1110500	1114700	Boyfriend texting married female coworker after working hours.
1114700	1115200	Thoughts?
1115200	1117100	He talks a lot about female coworker.
1117100	1119000	Her name comes up several times per week.
1119000	1121600	They've gone on a work trip together alone.
1121600	1124700	Last weekend he suddenly wanted to go for a local day trip
1124700	1126700	and the car read aloud a text from her
1126700	1129500	that she was coincidentally at the same location
1129500	1131400	like they were discussing it over text.
1131400	1133700	He mentioned her several times while we were out.
1133700	1137000	Altogether gave me the impression since he talks about her frequently,
1137000	1138100	he thinks of her a lot.
1138100	1139800	Perhaps I think too much into things.
1139800	1140400	Thoughts?
1140400	1143500	And a group expert gives the great advice of
1143500	1145200	go through that phone.
1145200	1146400	Oh my god.
1146400	1149600	Listen, I support women's rights and women's wrongs,
1149600	1150200	but I...
1150200	1151300	This one's a bit far.
1151300	1153400	10 out of 10, this group brought the drama.
1153400	1155300	Quotes and healing prayers.
1155300	1158200	Your bank account is just about to overflow.
1158200	1158900	Put okay.
1158900	1159700	Amen.
1159700	1162000	You people cannot follow directions.
1162000	1164600	And right when I was about to close the book on this saga,
1164600	1167700	you literally cannot be on Facebook for more than a couple hours
1167700	1170600	if you're lucky without running into a scam.
1171600	1175400	On another post in this group, a reply to Amen was,
1175400	1177400	Send a friend request to Mrs. Angel.
1177400	1178300	She will help you.
1178300	1182600	I am building my own house and I also have groceries through her company.
1182600	1184400	She is legit and trustworthy.
1184400	1185300	Click on her name.
1185300	1190900	And in the URL, there's Bitcoin and it's to someone named Angle and not Angel.
1190900	1194400	And this is definitely them in the profile picture and not fake at all.
1194400	1197900	Their header kind of tells us everything we need to know about what they do,
1197900	1199700	except is this a thumb?
1199700	1202000	How does that even happen on this type of image?
1202000	1206900	We guarantee you the best trade strategies in business trade wisely
1206900	1209300	and gain financial freedom.
1209300	1214200	Bitcoin mining eight years years of University of San Diego.
1214200	1218100	I majored in Bitcoin mining for eight years years.
1218100	1218400	Yeah.
1218400	1223700	And I did my master's in hacking class logistics of University of San Diego.
1223700	1227400	This scammer in particular will Photoshop posts like this one
1227400	1230700	where they're pretending to be a satisfied investment client
1230700	1235100	where they basically runescape scam you by promising to double your Bitcoin or money
1235100	1238400	and then tricking you in some way or just straight up stealing your money.
1238400	1242500	But this person obviously got a new car and store so we should be happy for them.
1242500	1246800	Like the 99 bot comments congratulating them in the exact same way.
1246800	1252000	I wanted to see if these bodied accounts were fake accounts or hacked ones of victims
1252000	1254600	and everything just keeps getting weirder.
1254600	1256900	I guess I shouldn't be surprised because it's Facebook,
1256900	1262200	but every bot account I clicked on were from Lubbock, Texas, liked religious posts
1262200	1265200	and have posted a photo of themselves in the last month
1265200	1267200	and it's the first thing on their profile.
1267200	1271600	Now either the city of Lubbock has a really active crypto investment community
1271600	1276100	or these are hundreds if not thousands of fake profiles with the same parameters
1276100	1279100	which is ironic considering Facebook blocks real accounts
1279100	1282600	and asks for your physical government ID for you to log back in.
1282600	1285700	Yet their detection let's fake accounts flood the site.
1285700	1288800	There was this really popular type of scam comment that I saw
1288800	1292200	that reads very much like a genuine message up until the end
1292200	1296500	and it's usually like a woman in distress about her husband potentially cheating
1296500	1301300	and so she hires a hacker to reveal all his emails, Facebook and Instagram chats,
1301300	1305600	real-time call listening and his long-deleted messages.
1305600	1308900	My god, these hackers have more technology than Nicholas Cage did
1308900	1311000	to steal the Declaration of Independence.
1311000	1313600	But they'll refer the hacker's username at the end
1313600	1317900	to recommend to other vulnerable women in some potentially bad relationships.
1317900	1322300	They must target religious groups in particular because of the trust that's there.
1322300	1324900	Like, oh, this person is clearly an honest Christian,
1324900	1327100	like it's less likely that it will be a scam.
1327100	1330000	Plus, the demographic of people in religious Facebook groups
1330000	1333900	tend to be a bit older and a bit more easily tricked and fooled by this stuff
1333900	1335500	that's pretending to be genuine.
1335500	1338400	And like I said in my last video about Facebook Marketplace,
1338400	1341900	Facebook loves to let these scammers run rampant on their platform
1341900	1343300	without doing anything about it.
1343300	1347100	Last time I reported a scammer and they said we reviewed your report.
1347100	1349200	We concluded, nah.
1349200	1352100	They basically forced the users to self-moderate.
1352100	1354200	I noticed with a ton of the groups I joined,
1354200	1359200	I had to answer manual capture questions to make sure I was a real person
1359200	1363300	because the one public group I went in with no moderation was terrible.
1363300	1365800	There were the same videos posted over and over
1365800	1369000	that had nothing to do with Star Wars Endor Bush posting,
1369000	1371400	promoting 18-plus pages,
1373000	1376400	which is not allowed on Facebook, I just looked it up.
1376400	1380200	Facebook is a massive platform that spans across the globe
1380200	1383000	and makes it difficult to perfectly moderate.
1383000	1387200	But some of this stuff is like, dude, what's going on over there at Facebook HQ?
1387200	1390900	Among the groups and scams, this video will now come full circle
1390900	1394700	because the other 80% of Facebook groups that were recommended to me
1394700	1398800	were flooded with Timu and Xi'en support groups.
1398800	1400300	I joined all the ones I saw.
1400300	1402000	Now what the hell are these?
1406800	1408300	I paused for a moment there
1408300	1412500	and went down the most insane rabbit hole once again.
1412500	1416400	These pages are full of posts from real people from what I've gathered,
1416400	1421600	asking to accept some sort of Timu invite for them to get a free gift.
1421600	1426100	And I kept seeing like farmland or fish land everywhere on it.
1426100	1430900	And what it is, is these people are playing a game in the Timu app.
1437100	1441300	It's a farming sim that allows you to quote-unquote earn coupons
1441300	1443700	and free gifts upon playing their game.
1443700	1446600	How could Timu possibly benefit from this?
1446600	1450400	Well, to water the plants and earn money, you need water
1450400	1454700	and they give you almost enough water to earn all their free gifts
1454700	1457300	before they start making it more difficult.
1457300	1460200	They ask you to invite friends to get more water
1460200	1464700	or just browse the items for 60 seconds to earn more water.
1464700	1470900	And they ask you several times to spend $20 on Timu to get more water.
1470900	1474600	Those are like special tasks that earn you more in the game.
1474600	1476900	They ask you to turn notifications on
1476900	1480600	to remember to come back to claim more water from this loot box
1480600	1483600	and then invite more friends to get some water from that.
1483600	1487000	It's all purposefully to make shopping on Timu addictive
1487000	1490000	by forming the shopping experience around a game
1490000	1492900	all while you're recruiting new users for them.
1492900	1493700	Wow.
1493700	1496700	Plus these $30, $40 coupons they give you
1496700	1500600	are just on orders over $100 that they put in small tax.
1500600	1504500	There was another link in one of these groups that said I could get seven free items
1504500	1507900	and I picked out 10 really amazing items on here
1507900	1512700	and I only had to pay for the last three items which was around $40.
1512700	1516500	Also the insanity of claiming these items are way more expensive
1516500	1518700	than they really are on Timu's website.
1518700	1520100	It's just egregious.
1520100	1523300	It makes you feel like you're getting a great discount and a great deal
1523300	1526200	but you're really spending money that you otherwise wouldn't have
1526200	1528600	because you got sucked in with the seven free items
1528600	1530200	and now you're spending 40 bucks.
1530200	1534000	So these Facebook groups are built solely around accepting invites
1534000	1535100	to get discounts.
1535100	1537800	They even do trades for she and gifts too
1537800	1540500	because it seems like they have some sort of game as well.
1540500	1541700	I'm not sure how that one works
1541700	1545700	because that is a huge rabbit hole for an entirely different video.
1550800	1555500	It feels like Facebook emerged during this Wild West era of the internet.
1555500	1558700	Then it buttoned up early on in its career as a social media
1558700	1562600	and quickly devolved back into the Wild West of the internet here.
1562600	1566700	You have to engage your ancient internet instincts while you're on Facebook
1566700	1568700	because there's a scam at every corner.
1568700	1572300	Anyway, thanks for tuning into this episode of me eventually finding a scam
1572300	1573500	and everything I look into.
1573500	1575000	I feel like a scam magnet.
1575000	1579500	I suppose this isn't exactly what is the traditional sense of the word scam
1579500	1582800	but it sure is scummy tactics to get people to spend more money.
1582800	1586600	But I mean that's everything like casinos and stuff like it.
1586600	1587600	Everything is shit.
1587600	1591900	I am usually a positive person and try to find the positive in most things
1591900	1593400	but man, this sucks.
1593400	1596200	And I really wrote this sucks
1596200	1598700	and then I turned off my computer and went to bed.
1600700	1603500	I did not write a positive outro at all.
1603500	1606300	Anyway, send this to a parent who loves to click on fishing links
1606300	1608100	and make sure that they don't.
1609100	1610000	All right, that's it.
1610000	1610900	Bye.
1621900	1623900	What?
