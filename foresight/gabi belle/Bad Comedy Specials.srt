1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,880
Have you ever been perusing Netflix and looking at all the comedy specials that you don't want to watch?

2
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:10,080
Until you inevitably try one out and realize how much of a waste of time it is because,

3
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:13,920
oh my god, this comedy special is made for someone 50 years older than me.

4
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:17,600
But then, in the 80s, he put the earring in his right ear where,

5
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:19,040
ELLEN SHOTS GAY!

6
00:00:19,040 --> 00:00:23,040
That's not always a bad thing. Sometimes it's just not your taste.

7
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:25,120
Sometimes the content's just not made for you.

8
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:28,720
Sometimes you're just not the target demographic, which is what I tell my parents

9
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:32,480
when they watch my videos and they don't understand 90% of the references in them.

10
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:35,760
So I've already established that everyone's comedy taste is different,

11
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:39,200
and I know the title of this video, you might be like, oh goodness,

12
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:43,280
she's a snowflake comedy police coming after my favorite guy.

13
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:44,000
And you know what?

14
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:46,480
Yeah, kinda.

15
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:47,920
I'm just kidding.

16
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:52,400
I understand that comedy is comedy, and we can make comedy out of serious situations.

17
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:53,360
I really do.

18
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:57,200
I really don't think every single thing has to be inherently problematic,

19
00:00:57,200 --> 00:01:00,080
and everything's a problem, and oh, cancel culture.

20
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:06,480
But I do know things age poorly, and sometimes people also age poorly, and so do their jokes.

21
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:11,520
There are a few comedy specials lately that have been buzzing everyone's cringe radar.

22
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:13,120
They've been off the charts.

23
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:15,360
The cringe meter has been breaking lately.

24
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:17,360
I need to call the mechanic and get that fixed.

25
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:21,680
The cringe meter was sounding the alarm, and like a fly to dog shit,

26
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:26,800
I was there to stick my grubby little hands on it and get in there and see what it's all about.

27
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:29,600
So I have three comedy specials I want to show you today.

28
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:31,920
And by show you, I mean cringe with you.

29
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:36,320
So the first one I want to show you today is this beautiful man, Jim Brewer.

30
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:37,680
Brewer?

31
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,440
I went to their stadium once.

32
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:48,480
You thought I was gonna say hardly no or hardly ever is that a good joke unless Curtis Conner says it.

33
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:48,960
That's it.

34
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:52,160
So I'm gonna be honest, I know nothing about this dude,

35
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:55,920
but oh boy, are the first six minutes of this comedy special,

36
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:59,760
everything I need to see, and the only thing I want to see from this dude.

37
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:05,760
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the stage, Jim Brewer!

38
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:22,000
So we get this really lukewarm intro, and I really wish they like,

39
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,640
the editors took the time to actually put the song in the special instead of just the

40
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:30,000
recording of the sound going through a shitty microphone,

41
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,840
at going in whatever theater they're in.

42
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:34,160
So it's a little awkward, but it's fine.

43
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:36,320
This is how I was imagining it to go.

44
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:41,520
Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome your oomoo senpai, Jim Brewer!

45
00:02:41,520 --> 00:03:10,320
So yeah, after the classic rock you'd play while you're out fishing with your buds,

46
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:13,520
he opens up with COVID humor.

47
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:19,280
This was published four days ago, July 2022.

48
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:23,760
So yeah, this is already not going to age well in about like yesterday.

49
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:28,160
And just from this intro, you can tell that this is a guy that goes to like the neighbor's

50
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:33,120
birthday party in like a suburban neighborhood and thinks he's fucking hilarious.

51
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:35,600
Oh, you can't say anything anymore.

52
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:40,160
We're risking our lives to be here.

53
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,760
At this part, I was about to damn near jump out of my chair and crawl under the bed,

54
00:03:57,760 --> 00:03:59,360
because that took me by surprise.

55
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:03,440
The gain on that was just like plus 10 over what he had before.

56
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:26,320
So at this point, about 80% of this two minutes has just been him reenacting something.

57
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:32,560
You'll see that this is a common theme, actually so much so that somebody made a compilation video

58
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:38,640
of this special, but just the the unintelligible bits and there's a lot of it.

59
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:45,840
This is like 90% of his comedy is just over the top imitations of a person that doesn't exist in the world.

60
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:51,120
You hear that?

61
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:56,320
That's all of your grandpas and problematic uncles at every family gathering cheering for this guy.

62
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:59,440
The vaccinators, you were real cocky a couple of months ago.

63
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:02,080
We got vaccinated.

64
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:12,080
Got my second shot April 19th.

65
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:20,160
I can't get sick from the corona.

66
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:21,680
I'm vaccinated.

67
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:22,880
No one ever said that.

68
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:24,800
No one ever said that.

69
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:26,000
See this bucket of virus?

70
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:30,160
I'm vaccinated.

71
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:34,160
I'll even lick metal.

72
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:35,520
I'm not afraid of anything.

73
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:44,560
See, I told you it's just him unintelligibly reenacting something or someone that maybe one

74
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:48,640
person has said I would bet you one person thought that, but it's not true.

75
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:54,640
Not to be a anti-comedy Andy here, but no one ever said you couldn't get sick when you got

76
00:05:54,800 --> 00:06:00,400
vaccinated or, um, I'm sorry, the schmackschismation is just something that would prevent you from

77
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:04,800
dying or going to the hospital in serious condition is all.

78
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:05,360
That's it.

79
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:10,960
That no one said it was gonna make you super man or iron man just battling the virus like

80
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:16,720
see let me take a let me take a page out of Jim Brewer hardly know where his book here and

81
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:22,240
and give you a taste of my own taste, my own flavor, my own adaptation of Jim Brewer's comedy.

82
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:27,440
No one's going out here in a fucking iron iron man suit after getting the schmackschismation

83
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:28,400
going.

84
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:33,680
Can't touch me now virus.

85
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:40,400
That's me in my Batmobile.

86
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:44,400
Just dodging all the viruses.

87
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:48,560
Are you laughing?

88
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:49,120
Thank you.

89
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:50,080
Thank you.

90
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:52,320
Yes, uh, that's comedy here.

91
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:53,840
I don't have to wear a mask.

92
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:58,560
That's exactly what I did.

93
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:03,200
As soon as I got my second vaccination, I went, I don't have to wear my mask.

94
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:07,120
I know this is a joke.

95
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:13,120
Okay, I obviously know he's not being completely serious, but this is rooted in some truth.

96
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:18,560
Like he actually kind of thinks this, you know, he at least says it to his buddies behind the scenes.

97
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:20,880
People vaccinated getting sick.

98
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:21,280
What?

99
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:25,440
You need a new booster.

100
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:25,920
What?

101
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:30,000
Who wants a shot?

102
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,520
Who wants to see a ball game?

103
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:40,320
Wave your flipper.

104
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:44,240
That's for you.

105
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:45,760
Go see the ball game.

106
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:47,840
Who wants, who wants to work again?

107
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:50,320
Who wants to work again?

108
00:07:50,320 --> 00:08:02,080
I have no idea where this comparison even came from.

109
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:04,560
I had watched this before and I didn't get it.

110
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:06,160
And I thought upon rewatching it.

111
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:09,520
I would understand how like, I don't even know who he's imitating.

112
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:11,120
Is he, are we seals?

113
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:14,480
Are we seals for, for getting the schmackschismation?

114
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:15,440
Is that what it is?

115
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:16,640
Are we just play seals?

116
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:20,640
Is the point that we just like go along with whatever the authorities are saying?

117
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:23,360
Is that, is that that I don't understand?

118
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:24,880
What's in the shot?

119
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:25,680
It's safe.

120
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:26,320
Don't worry.

121
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:28,160
Don't worry.

122
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:31,200
The ingredients are on the website.

123
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:31,840
Trust me.

124
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:37,120
I, I looked up so many, so many different sources for what's in it.

125
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:38,080
You know, it's new.

126
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:38,880
It's brand new.

127
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:40,080
It was coming out really fast.

128
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:41,600
It was a stressful time.

129
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:44,240
A lot of friends that I had were nervous about getting the shot,

130
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:45,600
even though they're, they're for it.

131
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:47,040
I just, I'm so confused.

132
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:51,760
So yeah, I've, I looked up extensively what was in it and I can confirm that it is safe.

133
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:53,280
I didn't die.

134
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:53,840
I'm here.

135
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:55,520
I'm good.

136
00:08:55,520 --> 00:09:01,120
I'm confused what the purpose of this is in the, in the good big year of 2022.

137
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:03,600
You know, like we've, we've gone through this.

138
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:05,840
Like, I don't feel like getting into this.

139
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:16,560
I, I mean, when I take all the steps back, I feel like this is going to be a Broadway

140
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:17,840
play in three years.

141
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:20,880
You know what I mean?

142
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:21,360
Like, wait.

143
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:30,080
Six foot safe.

144
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:41,600
Don't shoot distance six foot safe.

145
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:44,800
This bit goes on for way too long.

146
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:50,480
And I hope by now you can understand why I couldn't stomach to watch any more of this

147
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:55,280
entire hour long special because I bet you it's, it's more of this.

148
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:59,200
It's a lot more of this where he's just reenacting something.

149
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:01,120
That's the whole comedy.

150
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:02,880
Can we switch it up a little bit?

151
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:18,960
Like the bit is dead at this point and he just keeps going, keeps killing it.

152
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:23,680
And you know, they say if you can't, if you can't beat them, join them.

153
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:24,480
So let's do that.

154
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:40,080
I'm the grand ma killer.

155
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:48,080
Six foot safe.

156
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:51,360
Yeah, six foot safe.

157
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:53,360
It's not even a good show too.

158
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:55,440
And like, I can't even build off of that.

159
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:56,720
Six foot safe.

160
00:10:57,680 --> 00:11:01,120
How am I going to know if it's okay?

161
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:05,520
How do I know if I can see Aunt Linda today?

162
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:08,080
Well, I don't know.

163
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:12,480
I don't know who's gonna show me.

164
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:16,400
Who's gonna show me how.

165
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:26,400
And we have to cover our face in the name of grace just to feel disconnected.

166
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:31,360
Aunt Linda, when am I gonna see you?

167
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:42,560
Hopefully in a year or two, I can see you and Uncle Jim too.

168
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:49,440
Curtains close and that's the end of the first musical number.

169
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:52,080
Scene two opens.

170
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:56,800
Crazy Uncle Jim Brewer sitting at the family dining table.

171
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:58,400
No mask alone.

172
00:11:58,400 --> 00:11:59,440
One chair apart.

173
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:02,800
The family sitting at the rest of the table.

174
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:04,000
Disappointed.

175
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,600
Listen to the rules.

176
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:11,200
Here come the governors.

177
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:18,240
We have no laws and regulations.

178
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:32,160
We shall determine who is essential.

179
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:36,880
So at first I thought he was trying to do this like really horrible Chinese accent.

180
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:44,400
And then I realized it's actually a horrible German accent and he's equating the American

181
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:52,960
government to a point in history where things got a little crazy.

182
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:59,520
I know jokes are supposed to be exaggerations but it's just not even funny.

183
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:06,640
Because the whole bit is just him pacing around making a silly face.

184
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:11,680
It's like he watched one Dane Cook special in 2008 and was like this.

185
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:13,600
This is the pinnacle of comedy.

186
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:23,360
Don't get me wrong I I that's actually that's the whole problem.

187
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:28,000
I used to like Dane Cook's comedy and you know what else I was also like 10.

188
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:31,840
So that about says everything you need to know.

189
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:36,320
It's comedy from 12 years ago and it should stay there.

190
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:37,840
It was good for its time.

191
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:40,720
You could leave it just leave it in 2008.

192
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:48,640
We shall determine who may go at your house and who shall have a muffin.

193
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:06,240
And remember if you see any children playing ooms outside together report them and their parents.

194
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:10,240
This is for your safety.

195
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:16,800
See the bit just goes on for too long.

196
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:22,400
I also am interested to know what the age range of this theater happens to be.

197
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:28,800
If we got a glimpse of the audience and what I wonder I just wonder that's all I'm just wondering.

198
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:41,360
Okay that's it that's eight stop stop two there's two I have I have I've had enough of this bit.

199
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:46,320
Okay so you've seen all that right that was the first like that was only six and a half minutes.

200
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:53,360
It felt like 30 and if there was that much like reenactment in just those six minutes

201
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:57,200
of him like exaggerating and overreacting check this out.

202
00:14:57,200 --> 00:15:00,960
This is Jim Brewer's stand-up comedy but only the unintelligible parts.

203
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:02,720
I recommend you watch this for yourself.

204
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:04,880
I'll link this video in the description below.

205
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:07,600
I'll only show you a little bit.

206
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:36,000
So that's just 30 seconds of it.

207
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:42,320
This compilation is eight minutes long and I know for a fact that there's more of it.

208
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:46,000
I know for a fact this person didn't even get all of the clips.

209
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:49,200
So that's about all I could handle for this portion of the video.

210
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:53,680
The next comedian I want to cover here is Brendan Schaub and I know other people have

211
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:59,600
talked about him and he's actually the most recurring guest on the Joe Rogan podcast albeit

212
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:04,480
I think they're more of the older episodes that he was on and he also used to be a

213
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:06,000
MMA question mark fighter.

214
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,440
Yeah he does MMA.

215
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:09,280
He does Brazilian Jiu Jitsu.

216
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:11,920
He also has like three different podcasts.

217
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:13,680
The Fighter and the Kid podcast.

218
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:16,400
The Below the Belt with Brendan Schaub podcast.

219
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:21,040
And co-host of the King and Sting podcast with another comedian Theo Vaughn.

220
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:23,280
The mullet guy you've probably seen clips of him.

221
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:28,560
So considering that Joe Rogan also went from the UFC to comedy to podcasting.

222
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:31,280
I'm here looking for guys to suck my dick and there's nothing.

223
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:36,320
It seems Brendan Schaub wanted to follow in his daddy's footsteps and do the same thing.

224
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:40,320
And you know from what I understand here not everyone can be good at everything.

225
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:45,360
Okay I'm not sitting here expecting these people to be like the best comedians on the planet.

226
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:48,800
Sometimes you're gonna make something and it's gonna flop and it's gonna kind of suck.

227
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:50,880
Okay that's just the nature of things.

228
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:53,200
We all have our flop era whether we like it or not.

229
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:54,320
That's just human nature.

230
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:55,760
It's nothing to be ashamed of.

231
00:16:55,760 --> 00:17:00,960
Unfortunately Brendan Schaub's flop era also includes um bad racist comedy.

232
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:02,480
But we'll get to that in a second.

233
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:06,400
So Brendan Schaub's special is 25 minutes long.

234
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:10,240
Posted on the Thick Boy channel with three C's.

235
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:12,240
Granted he's almost 40 but it's fine.

236
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:14,800
The special is called the Gringo Poppy.

237
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:20,560
So you see the branding here is already a little um Mexican and um no.

238
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:21,680
He's not Mexican.

239
00:17:22,320 --> 00:17:23,200
His wife is.

240
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:26,960
And you can see by the dislike ratio that this was not received very well.

241
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:53,840
So this is already starting off better than Jim Brewer's uh where they actually overlaid

242
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:58,240
the song that was playing correctly over the special before he gets on stage.

243
00:17:58,240 --> 00:17:59,920
So Brownie points there.

244
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:04,000
I also believe this is an original song made specifically for this and um

245
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,200
It goes hard as fuck.

246
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:06,960
Thick boy squad.

247
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:09,120
Thick boy nation.

248
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:11,680
You can catch that cover on my second channel.

249
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:17,840
So we have this really sad kind of middle school play set here of a city skyline made

250
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:20,000
with like poster paper from Michaels.

251
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:20,720
You know it's fine.

252
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:21,360
It's fine.

253
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:23,840
You got to make do with what you have.

254
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:24,160
Okay.

255
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:27,200
What's up Dallas?

256
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:34,800
Look at you guys.

257
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:36,880
I'm not used to this.

258
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:37,920
Dallas a little different.

259
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:40,000
There are some ladies in the crowd tonight.

260
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:42,640
I am not used to that.

261
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:48,000
They don't have women where you're from.

262
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:52,000
It's also pretty funny that this is Texas because you have this guy on the left here

263
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,840
with a don't tread on me sweater.

264
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:55,920
My demo 18 to 36 bros.

265
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:59,440
That's that's what I specialize in.

266
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:02,240
Sure I won't argue with that demographic.

267
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:03,680
Are we vaccinated up in here Dallas?

268
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:04,560
Everybody vaccinated?

269
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:11,200
I don't know why these people keep bringing up COVID in their comedy specials in the good

270
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:14,800
year of 2022 but I'm gonna be honest I'm sick of hearing it.

271
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:16,080
Can we please stop?

272
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:18,640
Please talk about something else.

273
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:21,280
I'm here to laugh, not be sad.

274
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:22,240
There's always one guy.

275
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:23,520
No fucking way bro.

276
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:32,000
That needle's not touching this fucking temple daddy.

277
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:37,600
As he says that he's taking a nacho dip in a nacho cheese.

278
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:42,560
Oh my bad Mr. Whole Foods.

279
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:49,600
So what Brandon's trying to do here is do a little bit of crowd work which is when a

280
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:56,400
comedian you know picks on people in the crowd and um man it doesn't go very well and I feel

281
00:19:56,400 --> 00:20:01,200
like people are really hard on this guy and hard on all these comedians really.

282
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:06,080
Not that they don't deserve to be grilled a little bit but it is really difficult.

283
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:11,120
It's not something that is easy to do and they're just bad at it because they're dumb.

284
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:16,000
Like it's really difficult and hard to master especially if you're new at comedy which I think

285
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:21,760
Brandon's job is new at least at stand-up but that doesn't mean that it's immune from cringe

286
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:23,200
and it's a little cringe.

287
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:28,480
Like he just made up a guy and like we did not see maybe it's because we weren't there but

288
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:31,920
we did not see any guy that was like no fucking way bro.

289
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:35,760
This needle ain't touching this daddy temple or whatever the fuck he said.

290
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:40,160
This whole vaccination stuff I'm not anti-vaxx man I'm vaccinated but it's uh.

291
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:43,440
I don't care I'm gonna move on to the juicy part.

292
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:46,160
I'm married to Mexican y'all I'm married to Mexican.

293
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:51,920
And that is why it's called the gringo poppy because I'm married to Mexican.

294
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:56,720
Dallas I don't mean like Taco Bell Mexican no no no I'm talking Guadalajara.

295
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:02,080
Born and raised came to the states 10 years ago illegally Mexican.

296
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:06,880
What is a Taco Bell Mexican Brandon?

297
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:08,640
What is a Taco Bell Mexican?

298
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:14,320
I um what I am interpreting this statement as is there are.

299
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:22,480
It's like if we said oh this is a this isn't a a Walmart white person.

300
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:28,560
This is a Crayton Barrel white person because that's that's the vibe that I'm getting from this.

301
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:32,640
So we're already putting Mexicans down in kind of a weird way.

302
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:36,720
You can bring your wife up without insulting other people.

303
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:42,000
I forget this one of my boys goes dude dude poppy what are you doing bro get with a Latina

304
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:47,360
bro you know why because they're fun and they're spicy no doubt definitely spicy

305
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:52,880
girl spicy right girl spicy you know what spicy means they're assholes that's what that means.

306
00:21:57,040 --> 00:22:01,680
We love the stereotypical sassy mean Latina.

307
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:07,600
Seven nights a week I'm not used to this I was like what the heat is every Wednesday fuck yeah

308
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:15,040
no dumb ass up the heat is every Wednesday real Mexican dishes y'all real shit from the motherland

309
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:17,760
I'm talking Wavos Ventil

310
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:19,760
Yo

311
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:40,960
Yeah so that's that's the comedy here um boy you can do self deprecating humor like this uh

312
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:44,800
just because you talk about another race doesn't mean it's inherently racist you can

313
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:52,800
believe it or not joke about other races without being racist but this is not it this is not it

314
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:57,440
I guess it just seems like cringy and stupid like I don't know how else to describe it

315
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:03,120
dude I did that 23 and me I did that shit you spin the cup email your DNA in I did that

316
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:07,920
they sent me drive mayonnaise back I am white as shit Dallas yeah

317
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:13,040
yeah my person handout page seven bitch I need a fucking tater tot once a week

318
00:23:15,680 --> 00:23:18,160
with a fucking hot pocket kill you every now and then

319
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:24,480
every time dinner we come I'm like oh does she really think beans go with every goddamn mail

320
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:30,160
she's serious so like sometimes it is fun to joke about and see the differences between our culture

321
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:36,160
and someone else's especially when you're married to that person but when you take that person's

322
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:42,880
culture and then make it your aesthetic and identity it's a little weird I can only speak

323
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:48,880
from personal experience but I've seen when um specifically white people will date someone

324
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:56,320
who's Asian and then they think that gives them a pass to like be an honorary asian you're not

325
00:23:57,040 --> 00:24:03,200
you're not you that doesn't mean you can use stereotypically asian imagery and scenery and

326
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:08,240
you're like your aesthetics and the way you dress and do your makeup so you look more asian

327
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:13,120
to make their eyes look longer and look more asian it's okay if you learn another language

328
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:16,800
because of your significant other I think that's really sweet I think that's cool I don't know

329
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:21,600
how to put like a hard line in the sand of when it gets weird but sometimes it's weird sometimes

330
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:26,240
it just gets weird every time dinner come like does it ever occur to her maybe Brennan's not

331
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:35,440
trying to shit his pants tonight how about that all right so we've hit mainly stereotypes so far

332
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:42,800
Mexican food spicy Mexican food hard to pronounce oh they have beans a lot Taco Bell all the hard

333
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:47,120
hitters there every time dinner would come my asshole go like this

334
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:58,320
we're dying down here puppy it's so spicy bro I've never been thicker since I got with a

335
00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:06,880
Mexican man thick with three fucking seas he said the thing he said the thing he said the thing

336
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:10,880
everything they eat bean cheese bean cheese bean cheese bean cheese like the hell man

337
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:16,320
we're just gonna carb load year-round we never tailor off the carbs that's a game plan beans and

338
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:21,360
cheese aren't particularly known for their carbs but go off I walk in the house last Friday

339
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:27,200
show enough there's a fucking fiesta my favorite food you know how like feel von

340
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:38,960
can brown cocaine you know how like he struggles with cocaine like if there was cocaine on the

341
00:25:39,040 --> 00:25:44,000
table right now he'd fucking snort it from right field you feel me god bless him I love that

342
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:50,400
fucking dude that's I am with fucking plus only I came out of nowhere and on that note

343
00:25:51,040 --> 00:25:57,040
basically TLDR when comedy relies on purely just stereotypes of another race it's just not that

344
00:25:57,040 --> 00:26:02,480
funny I really don't think he's actually racist and I really do think he loves his Mexican wife

345
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:07,280
and he loves the food and he loves the culture I really do believe that I just think the execution

346
00:26:07,280 --> 00:26:14,080
of this special with these jokes maybe not the best representation of that because there is a

347
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:19,280
way where you could possibly do that while still showing that you're endearing and you love you

348
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:25,200
love this culture and but still making some funny jokes about it but this was not that

349
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:31,840
unfortunately it was neither endearing nor funny so with that I want to show you the last comedy

350
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:39,840
special which is you know him you know him as the host of fear factor oh you didn't mean either

351
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:46,880
because I completely did not recognize him with hair I know Joe Rogan has a 2019 comedy special

352
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:52,160
and I watched the beginning of it and it wasn't terrible I firmly believe that you can dislike

353
00:26:52,160 --> 00:26:58,160
someone or you can like someone but still criticize the piece of media as it is you know you can not

354
00:26:58,160 --> 00:27:03,600
like Joe Rogan that much which I kind of don't but that doesn't mean everything he does is

355
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:08,320
automatically going to be unfunny and terrible because you know he's a fully dimensional person

356
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:14,640
as as are we all then again I did not watch the rest of this hour and 15 minutes of this 2019

357
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:19,120
comedy special so hopefully there's not anything in there that I would want to take back that statement

358
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:24,880
for um and uh yeah I wrote this down a unicorn is a donkey from the future

359
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:32,800
what the fuck does that mean it means you need to stop smoking so much weed stupid

360
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:38,800
yep pretty good anyway if you didn't know that he's actually been doing stand up for a long ass time

361
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:45,680
actually since 1994 and I did not know people were still alive back then so I want to watch a

362
00:27:45,680 --> 00:27:51,520
little bit of that with you because oh boy when I talk about humor that didn't age well

363
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:56,880
this is it tonight show features the comedy of Joe Rogan

364
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:04,960
holy shit these graphics dude I don't know exactly when this specific special was but I can

365
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:08,720
probably safely say from these graphics this is from the 90s

366
00:28:15,680 --> 00:28:20,640
this is ronda shear no I don't know who she is and I'm not going to tell you

367
00:28:21,680 --> 00:28:27,280
but I do love her hair I've been trying to achieve this style and I do not know how because I do

368
00:28:27,280 --> 00:28:32,320
not own a blow dryer so that's all I wanted to add to this little bit and let's hear it Mark one more

369
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:41,600
time for the spotlight cafe I also just want to point out that this person on the left here is

370
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:47,200
playing a key tar first of all coolest shit but also the cherry on top is that they're wearing

371
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:51,920
sunglasses with it I want to be their friend anyway you ready to meet your first act this evening

375
00:29:15,280 --> 00:29:21,120

376
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:27,520
to damn near jump in the ring here for double cage match featuring Logan Paul I know things about

377
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:34,560
wrestling put your hands together from Mr. Joe Rogan so enough of the dilly dallying here we're

378
00:29:34,560 --> 00:29:42,000

379
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:53,440
so

380
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:07,200
so yeah that immediately immediately didn't age well what an introduction these sideburns

381
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:13,120
killing me too and yeah his voice is like it's like you know that the spirit of Joe Rogan is

382
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:18,480
in there but I can't find him it's like the spirit of Joe Rogan has overtaken this young man

383
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:22,320
having a rough week man I've been here the m word too much for my girlfriend and I'm talking

390
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:16,960

391
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:20,720
because you don't have testosterone that's the big thing you don't have to donkey donkey juice so

392
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:26,960
you can't appreciate the way guys act okay so now we're into like alpha male podcaster territory

393
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:32,240
this is the blueprint this was the blueprint joe rogan was laying down for the musty and

394
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:36,160
dusty podcast boys that's what it is these guys be honest you're gonna be talking to a good-looking

395
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:39,520
girl but if you and the girl haven't had sex it doesn't matter what you're talking about

396
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:45,520
does it not matter does it not matter I just want a nice girl to talk to about minecraft is that too

397
00:31:45,520 --> 00:31:50,960
much to ask is that too much to ask what if they just want to talk about the 1.19 update they just

398
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:55,600
want to talk about the deep dark and how they they died fighting the warden that's I just your

399
00:31:55,600 --> 00:32:02,720
brain simply cannot be that much of a neanderthal it just it just can't right joe also that looks

400
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:07,840
like a pizza is this not a pizza in the background got him hungry is all you're thinking while she's

hungry energize a rabbit run on your brain 24 hours a day go donkey donkey donkey still going donkey

405
00:32:35,680 --> 00:32:41,840
donkey donkey and on that note that has taken every ounce of energy out out of me these three

406
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:48,160
comedy specials have simply drained me like the villain in sailor moon draining young girl's energy

407
00:32:48,160 --> 00:32:55,040
to keep her young that's me but these three men and um I can't say Amy Schumer is any better

408
00:32:55,040 --> 00:33:01,280
I didn't include her because I just couldn't bear I simply just couldn't bear the tampon jokes I just

409
00:33:01,280 --> 00:33:08,000
