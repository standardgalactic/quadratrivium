WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:17.060
Well, we've just heard some wonderful lectures on RNA, coding, replication, evolution, but

00:17.060 --> 00:22.260
we still have this problem about what was the first engine and indeed what was its fuel.

00:22.260 --> 00:27.340
So I'm going to suggest that we should think about what life does rather than what it is

00:27.340 --> 00:28.720
to understand that.

00:28.720 --> 00:30.860
And what does life do?

00:30.860 --> 00:33.700
It hydrogenates carbon dioxide.

00:33.700 --> 00:38.300
Right down the bottom of the food chain and probably down the bottom of the evolutionary

00:38.300 --> 00:41.620
tree it hydrogenates carbon dioxide.

00:41.620 --> 00:47.720
So presumably that's how it started.

00:47.720 --> 00:52.660
So here's what I'd like to also emphasize and people have already worried me about

00:52.660 --> 00:58.220
the remark about entropy, but I think we shouldn't forget this wonderful book by Schrodinger.

00:58.220 --> 01:00.920
To me there were two wonderful books about the origin of life.

01:00.920 --> 01:06.260
One's worth reading and it's by Le Duc and by the way it's a century when it was published.

01:06.260 --> 01:09.180
It was published in 1911 and really it's worth a read.

01:09.180 --> 01:13.660
He had the Nianst equation, all the kind of things in it that in fact I'm going to allude

01:13.660 --> 01:18.420
to, the only thing he didn't have was an alkaline spring.

01:18.420 --> 01:23.260
Without taking the other book, of course, that is what is life and that's from Schrodinger,

01:23.260 --> 01:27.500
I'd just like to emphasize he kept on saying what does life do?

01:27.500 --> 01:31.020
It drinks orderliness from a suitable environment.

01:31.020 --> 01:33.780
So yeah, let's find with this suitable environment.

01:33.780 --> 01:35.140
What is a suitable environment?

01:35.140 --> 01:38.020
It's got to offer us everything, all in one place.

01:38.020 --> 01:39.980
We don't want any contingencies.

01:39.980 --> 01:44.280
It's got to be right there, nothing, no false pleas.

01:44.280 --> 01:48.720
So our suggestion then is basically we're looking at an earth which is a water world

01:48.720 --> 01:52.240
and I'm going to go back on to that but there's probably at least twice as much water on the

01:52.240 --> 01:54.360
early earth, probably more than that.

01:54.360 --> 01:55.560
There is no land.

01:55.560 --> 02:00.160
The day lasts about 12 hours, the moon's much closer, the galaxy's probably much closer

02:00.160 --> 02:02.200
and the other galaxies are closer.

02:02.200 --> 02:06.240
This is a different planet, don't think this planet, think another planet.

02:06.240 --> 02:10.560
It's a third of the age of the universe ago and of course we've got the water covering

02:10.560 --> 02:11.560
the planet.

02:11.560 --> 02:13.160
It's a pretty oxidized surface, don't forget.

02:13.160 --> 02:18.360
It's H2O and CO2 and without photosynthesis you can't do much better than that.

02:18.360 --> 02:23.680
So we've got an oxidized exterior and we've got one compartment on this planet of water.

02:23.680 --> 02:31.560
But we need to think about how we could get some tension on the planet because after all

02:31.560 --> 02:40.640
what we have is water we know can descend into the planet and in fact oxidize the surface

02:40.640 --> 02:46.520
or the near surface, oxidize it, carbonate it and hydrate it so much so that this water

02:46.520 --> 02:52.320
up here which probably supports up to 10 bars of carbon dioxide and maybe more, don't forget

02:52.320 --> 02:56.120
Venus has 90 atmospheres of carbon dioxide so we're not claiming much and as somebody

02:56.120 --> 02:59.120
said yesterday Mars has a carbon dioxide atmosphere.

02:59.120 --> 03:00.840
That's what these planets are like.

03:00.840 --> 03:05.000
At high temperature through volcanoes you get carbon dioxide so that's the exterior

03:05.000 --> 03:07.320
but the interior is electron rich.

03:07.320 --> 03:12.440
One comes the water and suddenly we're getting a differentiation of this seawater which was

03:12.440 --> 03:17.400
somewhat acidic up here, carbonic if you like, it comes down and it comes back up and it's

03:17.400 --> 03:18.400
quite different now.

03:18.400 --> 03:23.520
It's got a pH of about 11, it's got quite a lot of hydrogen so that's our fuel, it's

03:23.520 --> 03:28.400
our favorite fuel after all, what we're all trying to aim for, some methane, not such a

03:28.400 --> 03:30.440
bad fuel and some formate.

03:30.440 --> 03:34.280
So this is coming up now and it's like a titration.

03:34.280 --> 03:38.080
This water now is going to come out, there's five pH units different, it's going to come

03:38.080 --> 03:43.600
up and it's going to titrate into this ocean but as many of you, at least when I was young

03:43.600 --> 03:48.920
doing buretting you'd know that out of a burette or even a pipette you'd get some fouling

03:48.920 --> 03:52.640
and here we've got some fouling and it's inorganic fouling.

03:52.640 --> 03:57.200
This is all about an inorganic world to start with.

03:57.200 --> 04:03.920
So my molecule, pre-bodic molecule, what I think about the pre-bodic molecule, it's carbon

04:03.920 --> 04:05.160
dioxide.

04:05.160 --> 04:10.680
So we're bringing this material back up here, this water back up here, we get some fouling,

04:10.680 --> 04:16.080
we get some frustration, we get this therefore becomes the kind of creative place for interaction

04:16.080 --> 04:21.320
between the carbonic ocean and the hydrogen and this is where we would say hydrogenation

04:21.320 --> 04:25.960
of carbon dioxide would start and if we kind of blow this up a bit we've got our iron sulfide

04:25.960 --> 04:31.240
and iron nickel sulfides, the iron by the way coming out of this reservoir of an ocean

04:31.240 --> 04:37.200
and I'll explain that in a moment, some nickel, of course the CO2 and protons so we've got

04:37.200 --> 04:42.400
even a proton gradient so we've got a proton motive force but also we've got things like

04:42.400 --> 04:49.400
nitric oxide out here so we've actually got a redox gradient as well and the overall amount

04:49.400 --> 04:54.360
of energy is about between half and one volt so it's a commensurate energy with what we

04:54.360 --> 04:59.760
use today, so what life uses and we would suggest that life starts probably between

04:59.760 --> 05:04.360
40 and 80 degrees centigrade in such a system, a compartmentalized system.

05:04.360 --> 05:08.440
So I call this a two compartment entropy trap because we've had one compartment up here

05:08.440 --> 05:14.520
which was of course the open ocean and then we can differentiate that water and bring

05:14.520 --> 05:20.080
back the water and now we've got an entropy trap because we've got these two fluids constantly

05:20.080 --> 05:26.460
interacting with each other.

05:26.460 --> 05:32.020
So here's this turbulent water world, the Hadian water world, it's a single compartment

05:32.020 --> 05:37.820
as I say, it's got eight times the amount of UV present day that you wouldn't want to

05:37.820 --> 05:42.060
be on the surface of this planet, I mean it's really a hopeless place to be, there's no

05:42.060 --> 05:48.260
land to stop the hurricanes, it's continually out of physical equilibrium as well as chemical

05:48.260 --> 05:53.420
equilibrium so it's a turbulent world, the Hadian water world as I say and it's being

05:53.420 --> 06:01.340
impacted of course by bolides and after the lunar impact the ocean probably rained out

06:01.340 --> 06:05.960
around about 4.4 billion years ago and life would have started very shortly thereafter

06:05.960 --> 06:10.880
and it would be very hard to kill after that and I think that life probably started around

06:10.880 --> 06:14.760
about 4.4 and kept going.

06:14.760 --> 06:18.740
So we know now and of course we're getting yet another experience of this from Iceland

06:18.740 --> 06:23.380
that here's the volcano, this is last year's volcano from Iceland and of course out comes

06:23.380 --> 06:29.220
this carbon dioxide, some hydrogen sulfide, sulfur dioxide, trioxide, nitric oxide, plenty

06:29.220 --> 06:34.740
of nitric oxide not just because of the lightning but because nitric oxide is stable in this

06:34.740 --> 06:36.340
magmatic material.

06:36.340 --> 06:41.740
There's an interesting crossover geochemically so that really carbon, the state of carbon

06:41.740 --> 06:46.900
in the mantle at low temperature would like to be methane but around about four or five

06:46.980 --> 06:51.300
hundred degrees centigrade is a crossover between the redox condition of iron two to

06:51.300 --> 06:57.020
iron three and carbon methane to carbon dioxide so at high temperature you always get carbon

06:57.020 --> 06:58.020
dioxide.

06:58.020 --> 07:02.740
In fact geologists since Darwin have always known that the early atmosphere of this planet

07:02.740 --> 07:06.660
was carbon dioxide.

07:06.660 --> 07:12.580
So here's our earth and as I say it's oxidized on the outside, it's even probably got some

07:12.580 --> 07:16.700
ferric iron and yet the interior is reduced.

07:16.700 --> 07:23.700
It's in fact a little bit of native iron and some ferrous iron and that's the material

07:23.700 --> 07:26.940
that basically is oxidized by water to generate the hydrogen.

07:26.940 --> 07:32.420
So hydrogen becomes the carrier gas if you like of the electrons from the interior and

07:32.420 --> 07:38.420
actually it's a bit like an autotrophic bacterium, it just doesn't do the job fast enough but

07:38.420 --> 07:42.740
it does make some methane as we know.

07:42.740 --> 07:46.700
So we could think of this and I don't want to take this two series because I don't think

07:46.700 --> 07:52.940
methanogens were very early anymore but basically here's the reaction and the world can do it

07:52.940 --> 07:57.980
pretty well geochemically, hydrogen plus CO2 makes methane plus water.

07:57.980 --> 08:03.180
So we can think of this a bit like a methanogen, here's the methanogen or an electrochemical

08:03.180 --> 08:07.340
cell, the output as I say between half and one volt.

08:07.340 --> 08:11.380
So what we'd suggest then is can we imagine life kind of bubbling off from the surface

08:11.380 --> 08:17.700
of the planet and here we suggest that just as a bubble, here's the kind of inorganic

08:17.700 --> 08:24.620
membrane that I hope to show you, inside is very low pH conditions, sorry very high pH

08:24.620 --> 08:29.900
conditions, very low hydroxyl, very high hydroxyl amounts and on the outside you've got the

08:29.900 --> 08:35.300
protons from the protonic ocean or the carbonic ocean and so we've got a kind of entropy

08:35.300 --> 08:41.280
trap here because we've got order, continual order between the inside and the outside.

08:41.280 --> 08:45.460
This is reduced and this is somewhat oxidized on the outside and as I say it's a rather

08:45.460 --> 08:52.100
like bacterium except that bacterium transports the protons out of the cell to come back in

08:52.100 --> 08:58.260
to drive things like ATP whereas we don't need to drive that system because it's out

08:58.260 --> 08:59.860
here as part of the initial condition.

08:59.860 --> 09:05.460
So the initial conditions we would say favor metabolism right from the start.

09:05.460 --> 09:08.940
So here we have it again from Schrodinger order, from order.

09:08.940 --> 09:15.780
You can't have, you don't want a hypercyclic, you don't want to drag life out of a chaotic

09:15.780 --> 09:20.500
mess, you need to have direct delivery and there's one thing that if you're not a geologist

09:20.500 --> 09:25.620
or don't know any geology, the one thing I'd like to remember as a rock type and that is

09:26.260 --> 09:31.380
sub-pentanization and so this is sub-pentanide and you're going to see a few slides of this,

09:31.380 --> 09:36.140
you've all seen it in shop windows and so forth on the sides of shop windows.

09:36.140 --> 09:40.580
You can see how fractured it is, this is a kind of little engines of generation of hydrogen

09:40.580 --> 09:46.740
actually as the water permeates through this rock and sub-pentanizes what is the crust and

09:46.740 --> 09:51.820
this is why in a kind of analogy with Maxwell's demon, this is the demon that makes the difference

09:51.860 --> 09:57.340
between this fluid, sorry, this fluid and this fluid, the sub-pentanization reaction.

09:57.340 --> 10:05.580
So just to remind us that this is the United Nations building, by the way JPL said I really

10:05.580 --> 10:07.540
shouldn't show this side because it was political.

10:07.540 --> 10:12.060
Well I mean here's the president so I think it's beyond politics but anyway here's our

10:12.060 --> 10:18.180
sub-pentanide it's as you, I'm sure you've become aware of this rock type and what we're

10:18.220 --> 10:23.100
looking at is something called olivine plus water, basically here's olivine, magnesium

10:23.100 --> 10:29.660
iron silicate plus water, generate some silica, some magnetite so we've oxidized the iron

10:29.660 --> 10:35.860
now, magnesium and calcium go into solution to give you the hydroxyl, the alkaline fluid

10:35.860 --> 10:39.060
and hydrogen in solution.

10:39.060 --> 10:43.940
And if there's carbon dioxide, some a little bit of methane and this is the pathway, the

10:43.940 --> 10:49.420
geochemical pathway, it goes from CO2, basically it goes pretty fast to methane, or fairly

10:49.420 --> 10:54.900
fast to methane, although you can see some of them, you can get formate in the reactions

10:54.900 --> 10:59.460
so you can find this in a hot spring, typically hot spring, nothing to do with life at all,

10:59.460 --> 11:04.060
will generate methane and you'll have a little bit of formate, you don't see any methyl alcohol

11:04.060 --> 11:10.620
that seems to be pretty unstable and go to the methane.

11:11.540 --> 11:15.420
We've talked about the methane and I've just said that I don't think that this was an early

11:15.420 --> 11:19.740
reaction for biology, but nevertheless it's kind of there in the wings, the reaction that

11:19.740 --> 11:26.180
really takes place I think is the hydrogen plus the CO2 to acetate, so basically acetate,

11:26.180 --> 11:31.980
it's CO2 plus CH4 by the way, makes you acetate, so here's, to me this is the key reaction

11:31.980 --> 11:38.900
and in our lab we can never make this, we've never been able to make this chemically, so

11:39.060 --> 11:44.340
we think that this really was the job for life and so that thereby hangs the tale that

11:44.340 --> 11:49.740
we think that life, the beginnings of life was something that was a kind of microbe

11:49.740 --> 11:54.340
that was an acetogen, something that generated acetate from carbon, oxide and hydrogen.

11:54.340 --> 11:58.220
So we heard about the black smokers this morning, here they are and of course when, as soon

11:58.220 --> 12:02.260
as they were discovered, they were predicted by somebody by Jack Corliss and John Edmund

12:02.260 --> 12:08.260
were with Jack Corliss when these were discovered, predicted by the way in the Pacific at 360

12:08.500 --> 12:12.020
degrees centigrade, of course the first thing to come to their mind was well maybe life

12:12.020 --> 12:16.180
started here, Stanley Miller didn't like that and wrote a letter to Nature saying it was

12:16.180 --> 12:20.740
ludicrous to think life could start at 400 or 360 degrees centigrade, I mean yeah I agree

12:20.740 --> 12:25.300
with them, but interestingly there wouldn't have been black smokers on the early earth,

12:25.300 --> 12:29.740
there'd been many more of these springs but they would have been 400 degrees centigrade

12:29.740 --> 12:33.380
but they wouldn't be black smoke because the only reason why you've got black smoke here

12:33.380 --> 12:37.860
is because it's acidic, hot solution, it's not because it's cooling, it's because it's

12:37.860 --> 12:41.380
interacting with the alkaline seawater so you get the precipitation of this kind of

12:41.380 --> 12:47.740
so-called black smoke which are things like iron, zinc, manganese, oxides and nickel and

12:47.740 --> 12:53.300
a little bit of cobalt, so this basically they provide the trace elements into the early

12:53.300 --> 12:58.380
ocean and that becomes a reservoir, perhaps a super saturated reservoir of just the kind

12:58.380 --> 13:03.740
of metals we require for the first enzymes.

13:03.740 --> 13:07.660
So we've seen this, so this I'm not sure if you can get this, this is the ocean floor

13:07.660 --> 13:13.700
spreading, here's the actual spreading axis here and right here we've got the magma, here's

13:13.700 --> 13:18.060
the magma chamber so the water comes down to just about its critical point, perhaps a little

13:18.060 --> 13:22.700
bit higher, becomes very buoyant, shoots back up and as I think Jennifer said you know

13:22.700 --> 13:28.540
they only last for about 10 to 100 years so that's not very long and let's say they're

13:28.620 --> 13:34.260
up to 400 degrees centigrade, so it can't be here but we've been working in mineral

13:34.260 --> 13:41.260
deposits in Ireland and Alpine ultromethic provinces as called so we assume that there

13:43.860 --> 13:50.220
should be other kinds of hot springs on the early earth and we predicted in 1989 that

13:50.220 --> 13:55.540
there should be alkaline springs and Fortune would have it, a PhD student was looking out

13:55.540 --> 13:59.620
of the submarine window as they were going to the mid-oceanic ridge, the mid-atlantic

13:59.620 --> 14:06.620
ridge and she saw that some kind of little wisps of white smoke material and she stopped

14:08.860 --> 14:12.260
the submarine, told Deb Callie and they went back and they found this extraordinary structure,

14:12.260 --> 14:17.620
it's still the only main one to be found so far but it's the Lost City submarine spring,

14:17.620 --> 14:23.180
it lasts for at least 30,000 years, pretty certainly 100,000 years so that's a 10 to

14:23.220 --> 14:28.220
the 17 microseconds and somebody also said yesterday or perhaps this morning that the

14:28.220 --> 14:32.380
interactions, the chemical interactions, we shouldn't think in our terms of us, our

14:32.380 --> 14:37.220
big bulky selves in our time, we should think in terms of how long it takes to make these

14:37.220 --> 14:42.060
chemical reactions so 10 to the power of 17 microseconds I would think is plenty of time

14:42.060 --> 14:48.260
for life to start. So what we got here, so we've got this made of calcium and magnesium

14:48.260 --> 14:54.940
hydroxide, it's up to 94 degrees centigrade, not too hot, 15 millimoles of hydrogen so

14:54.940 --> 15:01.940
that's plenty of fuel, up to 2 millimoles of methane and they make compartments so

15:02.940 --> 15:08.100
in the precipitation there's always, always these springs, whatever the kind, always generates

15:08.100 --> 15:14.700
some hollow compartments where the fluid makes its way through in a kind of labyrinthine manner

15:14.780 --> 15:18.300
and some of them seal off and so forth and I think these compartments are all important

15:18.300 --> 15:23.460
because we must have compartments I think for metabolism to make any sense, not only

15:23.460 --> 15:29.340
to keep the goodies so to speak inside but also to use those gradients which are pH gradients,

15:29.340 --> 15:36.340
redox gradients and of course even a temperature gradient. So here's, this is geochemistry

15:36.900 --> 15:42.740
and one thing to say about it is if it was geochemically easy to make, to reduce carbon

15:42.740 --> 15:49.220
dioxide to methane, there would be no life, no requirement for it, it's a very fact that

15:49.220 --> 15:56.220
it's such an uphill task to add an electron to CO2 and then reduce it to formate and formaldehyde

15:56.740 --> 16:02.020
and then once you've got there, downhill it goes but because of this life can come in

16:02.020 --> 16:07.860
here as the catalyst to bring us up to formate or formaldehyde and then downhill, it's like,

16:07.860 --> 16:14.860
it's a kind of geochemical siphon. So, and here's what the methalogens do, so they make

16:15.500 --> 16:22.100
it easier, catalysis lowers the activation energy required for the reaction and also

16:22.100 --> 16:29.180
an ionic gradient is required to help CO2 be reduced to formate and then after that

16:29.180 --> 16:34.260
it's fairly well downhill but it's very complicated to get energy out of this so I don't think

16:34.260 --> 16:40.060
that this was, the methalogens were not eaten early but we think the acetogens were. So

16:40.060 --> 16:45.180
the acetogens now, they don't need an ionic gradient so much, well except in a sense

16:45.180 --> 16:50.860
they need ATP or adenosine triphosphate and it's adenosine triphosphate that drives the

16:50.860 --> 16:56.500
CO2 up to formate and formaldehyde and methylene and then downhill and then you add a methyl

16:56.500 --> 17:02.500
group to carbon monoxide which is reduced elsewhere and you end up with acetate which

17:02.580 --> 17:07.580
of course can take you on a pyruvate and eventually can aminate by the way all these reactions

17:07.580 --> 17:14.580
taking place most easily in alkaline solution. So here, you put it all together and let's

17:14.580 --> 17:18.660
think of this, you can think of this in all kinds of ways, it's the fractionation column,

17:18.660 --> 17:23.740
it's a hydrothermal flow reactor and so, but what I've done is kind of dress it up as one

17:23.740 --> 17:28.780
structure here but let me just remind you that here's, here are the reduced molecules

17:28.780 --> 17:33.740
coming out, there's hydrogen of course, a little bit of methane, some ammonia, molybdenum

17:33.740 --> 17:38.660
sulfide, soluble in alkaline solution as in, as our tungsten oxide which I think is pretty

17:38.660 --> 17:44.260
significant because we, all life seems to require this molybdenum and tungsten at this

17:44.260 --> 17:50.980
early stage of reduction and what I've plotted here really is basically the acetyl coenzyme

17:50.980 --> 17:56.700
A pathway. So the CO2 comes from the outside, we think that we need some ferric ion or maybe

17:56.700 --> 18:04.140
nitrate out here to help to oxidize the reduced molybdenum site so you lose an electron from

18:04.140 --> 18:08.140
molybdenum from molybdenum 4 to molybdenum 5 and then you've got a very energetic electron

18:08.140 --> 18:13.380
which can then reduce the CO2 and once you've done that then you're off on the, on that

18:13.380 --> 18:22.300
pathway up through onto a cobalt enzyme which will take the methyl group onto acetyl coenzyme

18:22.300 --> 18:26.260
synthase itself which is a nickel bearing enzyme, notice the importance of metals in

18:26.260 --> 18:33.820
here, we've already required molybdenum, iron, of course iron sulfides as well and the cobalt

18:33.820 --> 18:40.860
and the nickel and once we've got here then that the acetate can be taken either by what

18:40.860 --> 18:48.500
is now the synthase, the thiol group and the thiol can then be phosphorylated to, to generate

18:49.060 --> 18:55.420
acetyl phosphate and the phosphate can then with the help of other phosphate from outside

18:55.420 --> 19:06.020
be, help to generate pyrophosphate from monophosphate so this in the acetyl coenzyme pathway is

19:06.020 --> 19:14.580
ADP to ATP, here we're using just monophosphate or orthophosphate to go to pyrophosphate

19:14.660 --> 19:23.380
and that then feeds into general biosynthesis, acetogenic biosynthesis, I should say that

19:23.380 --> 19:27.940
there's also a methyl group here and I think that methanotrophy was probably early as well

19:27.940 --> 19:34.740
and what was the oxidant for methanotrophy, probably nitric oxide on nitrate, so we've

19:34.740 --> 19:39.180
got two different kinds of schemes here, one basically doing the main job for the world

19:39.180 --> 19:45.100
and that's spending the hydrogen fuel and a little bit on the side spending the methyl

19:45.100 --> 19:50.900
fuel, so what do we do with this, well we can take it into the lab and we can put a hydrothermal

19:50.900 --> 19:56.020
solution on one side and ocean water on the other and we can mix them, we can heat them

19:56.020 --> 20:02.500
up to 100 degrees centigrade, we can put them into a central reactor here with ultramafic

20:02.500 --> 20:06.820
rock just like what's in the crust of the earth or the crust of Mars indeed or what

20:06.860 --> 20:11.660
was Venus, all the same rock with a little bit of sulfide and out comes the fluid, we

20:11.660 --> 20:15.780
then take this fluid and we take it to another lab and this is in the other lab and we inject

20:15.780 --> 20:20.100
this fluid into what we think of as a Hadean ocean which we had a little bit of ferrous

20:20.100 --> 20:25.180
chloride in up to perhaps 10 millimoles from those very hot springs, this kind of somewhat

20:25.180 --> 20:31.580
acidic ocean and we get this immediate precipitation, oftentimes sulfide, a little bit of silica

20:31.780 --> 20:36.860
and so on and what we, in that reactor we find we can make methane within actually just

20:36.860 --> 20:41.860
about 10 hours, we've got 16 parts per million by volume, so this is an eight biotic reaction,

20:41.860 --> 20:46.700
very easy to do and I think early life couldn't compete with geochemistry in this case. The

20:46.700 --> 20:51.260
hydrogen sulfide goes up to about 14 millimoles and then down to about 1 to 2 millimoles but

20:51.260 --> 20:56.980
again enough to precipitate such a membrane, here just to remind us is the sub-pentanization,

20:56.980 --> 21:02.380
the requirement of sub-pentanization. So what do they look like? So we can now say

21:02.380 --> 21:08.740
here's our main model, we're getting used to this now, now we know that we've got an

21:08.740 --> 21:13.540
actual mound, a hydrothermal mound that's got compartments in it, here are the kind

21:13.540 --> 21:17.220
of compartments, this is a chimney, within the chimney you get these small compartments

21:17.220 --> 21:22.780
made of iron sulfide or ferrous hydroxide or oxyhydroxide with plenty of what looks

21:22.780 --> 21:28.820
like catalytic surface to my mind anyway. So this is now the sequence and what we've

21:28.820 --> 21:33.020
got here also is a propensity for waste, we can dispose of the waste, the things that

21:33.020 --> 21:39.900
do not play, the molecules that do not interact can just be taken off as waste and of course

21:39.900 --> 21:45.060
just like life itself, this is an entropy generator but ordering, there is ordering

21:45.060 --> 21:51.460
going on within these structures but outside then entropy is generated through the waste,

21:51.460 --> 21:56.580
polythermal, polychemical. So putting the whole thing together again, making it slightly

21:56.580 --> 22:03.020
more reasonable to look at, here's our hydrothermal mound, submarine hydrothermal mound, it's being

22:03.020 --> 22:08.620
fed with hydrogen sulfide, hydrogen ammonia, milliptin and tungsten, up to 120 degrees

22:08.620 --> 22:13.620
centigrade pH 11 coming into this somewhat acidic ocean with all these electron acceptors

22:13.620 --> 22:19.380
on the outside and the metals and phosphate and precipitating structures that are rather

22:19.420 --> 22:25.260
similar, mineral structures that are rather similar to the active centers of enzymes and

22:25.260 --> 22:31.060
just to emphasize this point one more time, here's the protons on the outside and we speculate

22:31.060 --> 22:40.060
that the protons can basically drive monophosphate, phosphorylation to diphosphate or perhaps

22:40.060 --> 22:45.020
through acetyl phosphate. So here's our proton motive force, it's all there, everything

22:45.260 --> 22:51.660
you require for early life is there, all the metals, all the energy. So what I want to

22:51.660 --> 22:56.780
emphasize is that biochemistry isn't just better geochemistry, there really is a discontinuity

22:56.780 --> 23:02.140
and that discontinuity because people have been very unsuccessful in generating I think

23:02.140 --> 23:07.900
organic molecules because they think that all you have to do is get the recipe right,

23:07.900 --> 23:11.780
the chemical recipe and we'll get life. I don't think so, we've got to have that proton

23:11.820 --> 23:20.820
motive force and redox gradients. So we can go to Gunter Vectors Heuser and Claudia Huber

23:20.820 --> 23:26.580
for perhaps one of the first interesting structures. Now this isn't so good as it looks I admit

23:26.580 --> 23:31.940
but what he's taken is a methyl group and a carbon monoxide and shown that on nickel ion

23:31.940 --> 23:40.940
sulfide and indeed even nickel sulfate or nickel sulfide then he can make acetyl thioacidate

23:40.940 --> 23:46.940
basically and hydrogen sulfide. He's done this at pH 6.4 which is very nice little spike here,

23:46.940 --> 23:50.940
we haven't been able to reproduce that but that could be our failing but you could see that

23:50.940 --> 23:56.620
actually it's very well satisfied this kind of reaction at pretty high pH. So again I want

23:56.620 --> 24:02.700
to emphasize just how many of these reactions are promoted by alkaline conditions. So we take

24:02.700 --> 24:08.700
a closer look at our membranes, our structures made in the lab and there are some peculiarities

24:08.700 --> 24:13.820
to it and of course anybody's got any ideas about this I'd welcome them but here this is the kind

24:13.820 --> 24:17.660
of membrane so we're inside the membrane here this is and you can see these love what are called

24:17.660 --> 24:24.220
framboids it's kind of raspberry shaped ion sulfides that grow on the inside then here we've

24:24.220 --> 24:29.820
got a mixture of ion monosulfide and something called Gregite Fe3S4 and on the outside is what

24:29.820 --> 24:36.460
the outside looks like absolutely extraordinary ordering of the outside and indeed even the

24:36.460 --> 24:41.500
inside looks like this and we thought that might be kind of claddeny plate material we're just not

24:41.500 --> 24:46.140
I don't know why these make such beautiful structures I mean they're much more beautiful

24:46.780 --> 24:53.820
and reliable and then waves on a beach in sand and we would say that most of the action takes

24:53.820 --> 24:58.620
place here the alkaline flow goes out the acidic counter flow comes in and most of the

24:59.660 --> 25:05.180
organic interactions or organic synthesis we would argue would be happening actually within

25:05.180 --> 25:11.580
the membrane this membrane's about five to ten microns across pretty wide for a membrane and it's

25:11.580 --> 25:16.940
inorganic so if we look again at this what what are the structures of the elements or the the

25:16.940 --> 25:21.420
minerals that make make this well look the main mineral to precipitate is something called mechanawad

25:21.420 --> 25:26.460
and it's made here it is an ion sulfa ion sulfur rom basically you put this together in such a way

25:26.460 --> 25:32.220
that it makes for something that's actually a pretty good electron conductor in that direction

25:32.300 --> 25:37.820
and a very good insulator in this direction it's it's uh so we've got a semi permeable and a

25:37.820 --> 25:42.060
semi conducting membrane so this is one of the chimneys here's here's a chimney again and this

25:42.060 --> 25:46.940
is kind of a little offshoot little compartment here and here are subcompoundments within the

25:46.940 --> 25:54.140
membrane itself now if you look at that mechanawad how similar it is to the actual active center of

25:54.140 --> 25:59.020
hydrogenase and one thing we need to do is if you've got H2 you've got to split into two electrons

25:59.020 --> 26:04.540
and two protons so and this is what hydrogenase does and here here's a structure ion sulfur ion

26:04.540 --> 26:10.860
sulfur so similar of course to this structure here so could it be that this was the first

26:11.900 --> 26:17.660
hydrogenase it doesn't not a very effective one but effective enough and not only that could it be

26:17.660 --> 26:23.020
that it's ready for co-option so that if it were to be co-opted by a short peptide maybe that would

26:23.020 --> 26:31.820
make it even slightly more active so we if you have this at 80 degrees centigrade this hydrothermal

26:31.820 --> 26:36.540
chimney then within about two or three days sometimes sooner you get the generation of

26:36.540 --> 26:43.100
something called gregite which is fv well it should be fv5 ni s8 oftentimes there's not nickel

26:43.100 --> 26:48.540
there sometimes there is if the nickel is there and it's going to be in this tetrahedral side here

26:48.540 --> 26:53.020
so here we've got now we've put the two roms together so we've got ion sulfur ion sulfur and

26:53.020 --> 26:57.980
behind it ion sulfur ion sulfur through two sulfas to nickel so and this is just slightly

26:57.980 --> 27:02.540
oxidized and it's the ion that's oxidized not the sulfur so this is nothing to do with the

27:02.540 --> 27:07.180
pyrite hypothesis because that's the pyrite hypothesis it's a sulfur that gets oxidized but

27:07.180 --> 27:11.900
of course with it's much better i think if we have the ion going back from shall we say

27:12.620 --> 27:20.380
2 plus to 2.5 plus on average again here's the what the membrane looks like this made of this material

27:22.220 --> 27:26.860
and look how similar it is to acetylcoenzyme synthase which is kind of where we came in here's

27:26.860 --> 27:32.780
the nickel side through sulfur and here's now we've got a box or a cubane structure which is

27:32.780 --> 27:37.980
extraordinarily similar to the cubane structure in here so again we're wondering can this be

27:37.980 --> 27:45.500
the kind of structure that is actually acting as acetylcoenzyme synthase type in the in the

27:45.500 --> 27:52.220
vectus hyzer huba reaction so here we have those that kind of structure so what's next well of

27:52.220 --> 27:57.260
course what we need next because what's easy to make with and and as everybody's agreed RNA is

27:57.260 --> 28:03.260
hard to make almost impossible to make but but amino acids are easy to make in the lab so we would

28:03.260 --> 28:10.700
say that that's first and here again huba and vectus hyzer has made some amino acids in the lab

28:10.700 --> 28:19.100
and not only that they can amenate them and in this case they've amenated these various structures

28:20.300 --> 28:24.220
with either iron sulfide or ferrous hydroxide so that's the kind of thing that should be able to

28:24.220 --> 28:31.180
happen in our chimneys and they happen at pH 9 and the yield is extraordinary

28:33.340 --> 28:39.900
well if we can do that can can we if we if pyrophosphates available and and I should say that

28:39.900 --> 28:45.660
diswort and and Andy Pratt have produced pyrophosphate in the lab in a kind of substrate

28:45.660 --> 28:51.900
phosphorylation technique using ferrous iron as the catalyst and iron sulfide and and using that

28:52.940 --> 28:56.540
then yamanaka et al and others have managed to

28:57.100 --> 29:04.860
uh actually phosphoryte and then uh basically dimerize uh with trimetaphosphate in this case

29:04.860 --> 29:11.260
glycine to two glycines and that's pretty not a bad yield uh at about pH again right about pH 9

29:11.260 --> 29:17.660
if you lower the pH uh then after after 20 days or so you can get up to glycine 4 or glycine 6 now

29:17.660 --> 29:24.380
once you've got the glycine 6 that's getting quite useful anything before five four and six

29:24.380 --> 29:31.020
becomes useful and one possible function for these is that they could then through uh then the amine

29:31.020 --> 29:37.580
group uh directly bond to the delta negative on on the amine group things like cobalt and nickel

29:37.580 --> 29:44.780
and could these be very inefficient but basically kind of pigment peptides and could they do we

29:44.780 --> 29:49.980
know these structures exist uh they've never been shown to be active uh because I think they've never

29:49.980 --> 29:55.420
been tested in this way but could these be for example similar to a transfer site for acetal

29:55.420 --> 30:02.300
coenzyme synthase and uh and the site for reduction of the methyl group to to methane so we've got

30:02.300 --> 30:08.300
structures again that everything as I say is kind of on the plate here uh so could we then have a

30:08.300 --> 30:14.220
beginning of a peptide takeover now nobody's shown this this is just paper chemistry as people

30:14.220 --> 30:20.860
would like to point out but here we'd suggest it could nevertheless ferredoxins are the uh according

30:20.860 --> 30:27.180
to Ecken Dayhoff in a wonderful paper in science in 1966 uh have the longest of all pedigrees of all

30:27.180 --> 30:33.180
metal proteins uh could it be the very first one was actually structured in a loop uh through

30:33.180 --> 30:39.260
hydrogen bonding through to that to a thylated ion sulfide so here's here's our cubane structure

30:39.260 --> 30:46.140
and here's the possibility of uh it's actually being thylated sorry uh hydrogen bonded to the

30:46.140 --> 30:51.740
backbone it notice it doesn't matter what the side chains are just the backbone of a short peptide

30:51.740 --> 30:56.460
now of course these days it's and probably fairly early on it's cysteines but cysteine is hard to

30:56.460 --> 31:01.420
make in the lab it may be there were no sulfur bearing amino acid side chains right at the

31:01.420 --> 31:07.100
beginning but you will notice if you people who worked on ferredoxins the ion sulfide is always

31:07.100 --> 31:15.660
in a loop so we'd say then uh working with uh Wolfgang Nitschke uh he's he's suggested and for

31:16.380 --> 31:21.020
various reasons including phylogenetics that the last universal common ancestor which we

31:21.020 --> 31:27.820
would put further back uh but nevertheless uh we'd say that the last universal common ancestor

31:27.820 --> 31:33.820
must have had millibitim di-terrin enzymes had nitric oxide, ridottes, nickel ion, hydrogenase

31:33.820 --> 31:39.100
and acetylcoenzyme synthase and carbon monoxide dehydrogenase which you have to have metals for

31:39.100 --> 31:43.660
this and we'd suggest the metals were right in there right at the beginning uh and eventually

31:43.660 --> 31:51.740
were co-opted so that all sounds part of that is airy fairy maybe but the earlier part I think uh

31:51.740 --> 31:57.660
it holds up well and now we've got the possibility that we've got a phosphate uh and we know we can

31:57.660 --> 32:03.100
see phosphate and pyrophosphate in these situations and that really would interact with the with the

32:03.100 --> 32:09.180
sidechain uh sorry the backbone of uh of short peptide to make a little peptide nest and and

32:09.180 --> 32:16.780
James Milner White and I call this a phosphate egg in in a in a peptide nest and this looks I think

32:16.780 --> 32:22.780
you'll agree very much like the P loop so here's the here's how we would dress that up but as a

32:22.780 --> 32:31.900
slightly longer peptide and we turn this in taking our cue from Enric and Margareta Balczewski we take

32:31.900 --> 32:38.300
the idea that perhaps uh they've the first kind of pyrophosphatase was a proton pyrophosphatase

32:38.300 --> 32:43.500
and that we could drive the generation of orthophosphate from pyrophosphate from

32:44.460 --> 32:52.860
orthophosphate by protons coming through the membrane and having a magnesium ion as the catalyst

32:52.860 --> 32:57.980
of course to because of the repulsion between the phosphates this is required but also this is a

32:57.980 --> 33:03.420
little kind of entropy uh to our mind kind of entropy catalyst as well holding things in because

33:03.420 --> 33:08.860
of the hydrogen bonding from the back of it from the amine group through to the oxygens on the

33:08.860 --> 33:15.180
phosphate so this would say perhaps this is what the early proton pyrophosphatase actually looked

33:15.180 --> 33:21.980
like and perhaps it was uh fired up basically by protons coming through the membrane from the acidic

33:21.980 --> 33:27.660
ocean so here we have the kind of rough equation for this magnesium phosphate plus the plus orthophosphate

33:27.660 --> 33:36.060
plus the proton to give us your magnesium diphosphate if we've got these short peptides what we've

33:36.060 --> 33:42.540
done here is to put four or five peptides actually in the hydrothermal solution the alkaline hydrothermal

33:42.540 --> 33:49.180
solution and when we do that we make even more better ordered structures and these structures are

33:49.740 --> 33:54.140
as you see just beautifully ribbed both inside and outside and glycine apparently gives us the

33:54.140 --> 34:01.180
best structure of all for reasons we don't understand so then we go back then to think

34:01.180 --> 34:06.940
where we've been with us and what we've done is to say take up an idea well a paper from Andrew's

34:06.940 --> 34:13.820
et al who could show that you could get mixed acid fermentation via formate hydrogen hydrogen liase

34:13.900 --> 34:19.500
and the reaction generates hydrogen and co2 from formate and protons and actually

34:19.500 --> 34:24.540
generates a proton motive force and it what is required here is uh one of these molybdenum

34:24.540 --> 34:31.020
enzymes and an iron iron sulfide factor as well and the nickel iron uh as well uh so what we've

34:31.020 --> 34:35.260
thought of and of course this is something we're trying to do in the lab uh is perhaps we could

34:35.260 --> 34:41.100
reduce it perhaps we can turn this around make the protons come inside using nickel iron sulfide

34:41.100 --> 34:46.940
and molybdenum as the as a catalyst and see if we can generate formate and and perhaps formaldehyde

34:47.740 --> 34:55.100
from the inside by reacting co2 and the protons and electrons to make the formate at pH 10 or pH

34:55.100 --> 35:01.660
9 or pH 10 so this becomes uh really uh holy grail that's one question we'd like to answer

35:03.180 --> 35:07.740
so what else does this kind of uh structure offer well we're not we don't know anything

35:08.700 --> 35:15.980
in detail about the RNA well but uh cunin and uh using cunin and cunin and martin and

35:15.980 --> 35:22.140
basket al have suggested that in fact if you've got structures like this then maybe the first RNAs

35:22.140 --> 35:30.220
wherever they come from act like viruses uh and uh basically can permeate through and start to make

35:30.940 --> 35:36.620
uh better replicators as we go through this the structure and but also if you were to make

35:37.340 --> 35:43.260
DNA in this in this series in in this way you could have a polymerase chain reaction which

35:43.260 --> 35:48.300
is run thermally or convectively because it's going to be cool on the outside and hot in the inside

35:48.300 --> 35:54.380
so you're going to have a convective polymerase chain reaction to build up shall we say uh DNA

35:54.380 --> 36:02.780
lengths and then thermophoresis or thermo uh thermal diffusion then tends to drive uh concentrated

36:03.900 --> 36:12.540
molecules that are that are ionic into basically into the coolest area of one of these compartments

36:12.540 --> 36:18.300
so so again we haven't just got the geotherm we haven't just got the redox gradient and the

36:18.300 --> 36:23.340
the pH gradient we've also got a thermal gradient that may help right at the beginning as you start

36:23.340 --> 36:31.340
to gain uh replication so this is the way then we would see the very emergence of life probably

36:31.340 --> 36:38.220
between 50 70 degrees centigrade 40 to 80 maybe uh hydrogen and methane as the fuels

36:38.220 --> 36:44.220
molybdenum tungsten absolutely required as catalysts along with iron iron nickel sulfides

36:45.340 --> 36:51.180
and perhaps the the first actual microbe which we would assume was a bacterium

36:52.140 --> 36:56.780
emanating from the spring not into the ocean by the way but down into the deep biosphere

36:57.580 --> 37:01.340
because i think it's basically a desert in the ocean and it's a dangerous desert as we've seen

37:02.380 --> 37:08.460
but these first this first uh microbes would be generating acetate or acetic acid and then

37:08.460 --> 37:15.180
there'd be some more minor reactions that would generate uh using nitric oxide as the electron

37:15.260 --> 37:22.620
acceptor uh carbon dioxide and nitrogen and water from this reaction uh and this would become to

37:22.620 --> 37:29.980
our minds the methanotroph the methanotrophic archaea so if we put all that together and we've

37:29.980 --> 37:36.780
heard other uh suggestions uh for example this morning about the big bang a big bang when i

37:36.780 --> 37:42.460
go to parties people ask me what i do and i you know i i kind of finally cough if they really seem

37:42.460 --> 37:47.100
to be interested and i tell them i'm working on the origin alive i see them six months later

37:47.100 --> 37:51.260
and they always seem to say oh you're the guy working on the big bang and it kind of pushed

37:51.260 --> 37:56.860
us in to this idea that you know we make the comparison and uh with shaw and carol on hand

37:57.820 --> 38:03.020
he wrote this lovely book called from attorney to here which the older people in the audience

38:03.020 --> 38:07.980
will understand there's a pretty good title and if he starts with a big bang and uh it's a very high

38:08.780 --> 38:14.540
enthalpy low entropy big bang and here we are now and we do the same thing we'd have a big bang

38:14.540 --> 38:19.900
we go from geochemistry to biochemistry but we can't just segue one from the other you you've

38:19.900 --> 38:24.460
got to go through this discontinuity and what helps us through the discontinuity we would say

38:24.460 --> 38:30.620
is the the proton motive force and chemiosmosis which are on tap in in the situation and then

38:30.620 --> 38:36.140
after that uh we get this various evolutions parts of evolution part of which has been covered by

38:36.140 --> 38:42.860
others of course this is huge yawning gap between metabolism and uh and replication and and we don't

38:42.860 --> 38:47.500
deny that one thing i would say though and and that is that nearly everybody that's been talking

38:47.500 --> 38:53.820
about RNA and DNA and uh enzymes are on the other side of a canyon for me i admit that but we can

38:53.820 --> 38:57.980
see each other from either side we're not that down there or up there we've got there is a lot

38:57.980 --> 39:03.420
in common between mineralogy and geochemistry and the very fact of the initial conditions

39:03.420 --> 39:10.700
that uh i think will eventually allow us to converge uh and just to emphasize that you know

39:10.700 --> 39:16.540
we've got 10 to the power of 17 microseconds and i really do think that's enough time for

39:16.540 --> 39:23.820
life to emerge imagine what 200 postdocs could do for you in that amount of time uh 24 7 of

39:23.820 --> 39:35.260
course 365 as usual that's it thank you very much
