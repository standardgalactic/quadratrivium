1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:17,060
Well, we've just heard some wonderful lectures on RNA, coding, replication, evolution, but

2
00:00:17,060 --> 00:00:22,260
we still have this problem about what was the first engine and indeed what was its fuel.

3
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:27,340
So I'm going to suggest that we should think about what life does rather than what it is

4
00:00:27,340 --> 00:00:28,720
to understand that.

5
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:30,860
And what does life do?

6
00:00:30,860 --> 00:00:33,700
It hydrogenates carbon dioxide.

7
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:38,300
Right down the bottom of the food chain and probably down the bottom of the evolutionary

8
00:00:38,300 --> 00:00:41,620
tree it hydrogenates carbon dioxide.

9
00:00:41,620 --> 00:00:47,720
So presumably that's how it started.

10
00:00:47,720 --> 00:00:52,660
So here's what I'd like to also emphasize and people have already worried me about

11
00:00:52,660 --> 00:00:58,220
the remark about entropy, but I think we shouldn't forget this wonderful book by Schrodinger.

12
00:00:58,220 --> 00:01:00,920
To me there were two wonderful books about the origin of life.

13
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:06,260
One's worth reading and it's by Le Duc and by the way it's a century when it was published.

14
00:01:06,260 --> 00:01:09,180
It was published in 1911 and really it's worth a read.

15
00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:13,660
He had the Nianst equation, all the kind of things in it that in fact I'm going to allude

16
00:01:13,660 --> 00:01:18,420
to, the only thing he didn't have was an alkaline spring.

17
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:23,260
Without taking the other book, of course, that is what is life and that's from Schrodinger,

18
00:01:23,260 --> 00:01:27,500
I'd just like to emphasize he kept on saying what does life do?

19
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:31,020
It drinks orderliness from a suitable environment.

20
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:33,780
So yeah, let's find with this suitable environment.

21
00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:35,140
What is a suitable environment?

22
00:01:35,140 --> 00:01:38,020
It's got to offer us everything, all in one place.

23
00:01:38,020 --> 00:01:39,980
We don't want any contingencies.

24
00:01:39,980 --> 00:01:44,280
It's got to be right there, nothing, no false pleas.

25
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:48,720
So our suggestion then is basically we're looking at an earth which is a water world

26
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:52,240
and I'm going to go back on to that but there's probably at least twice as much water on the

27
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:54,360
early earth, probably more than that.

28
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:55,560
There is no land.

29
00:01:55,560 --> 00:02:00,160
The day lasts about 12 hours, the moon's much closer, the galaxy's probably much closer

30
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:02,200
and the other galaxies are closer.

31
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:06,240
This is a different planet, don't think this planet, think another planet.

32
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:10,560
It's a third of the age of the universe ago and of course we've got the water covering

33
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:11,560
the planet.

34
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:13,160
It's a pretty oxidized surface, don't forget.

35
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:18,360
It's H2O and CO2 and without photosynthesis you can't do much better than that.

36
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:23,680
So we've got an oxidized exterior and we've got one compartment on this planet of water.

37
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:31,560
But we need to think about how we could get some tension on the planet because after all

38
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:40,640
what we have is water we know can descend into the planet and in fact oxidize the surface

39
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:46,520
or the near surface, oxidize it, carbonate it and hydrate it so much so that this water

40
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:52,320
up here which probably supports up to 10 bars of carbon dioxide and maybe more, don't forget

41
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:56,120
Venus has 90 atmospheres of carbon dioxide so we're not claiming much and as somebody

42
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:59,120
said yesterday Mars has a carbon dioxide atmosphere.

43
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:00,840
That's what these planets are like.

44
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:05,000
At high temperature through volcanoes you get carbon dioxide so that's the exterior

45
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,320
but the interior is electron rich.

46
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:12,440
One comes the water and suddenly we're getting a differentiation of this seawater which was

47
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:17,400
somewhat acidic up here, carbonic if you like, it comes down and it comes back up and it's

48
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:18,400
quite different now.

49
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:23,520
It's got a pH of about 11, it's got quite a lot of hydrogen so that's our fuel, it's

50
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:28,400
our favorite fuel after all, what we're all trying to aim for, some methane, not such a

51
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:30,440
bad fuel and some formate.

52
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:34,280
So this is coming up now and it's like a titration.

53
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:38,080
This water now is going to come out, there's five pH units different, it's going to come

54
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:43,600
up and it's going to titrate into this ocean but as many of you, at least when I was young

55
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:48,920
doing buretting you'd know that out of a burette or even a pipette you'd get some fouling

56
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:52,640
and here we've got some fouling and it's inorganic fouling.

57
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:57,200
This is all about an inorganic world to start with.

58
00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:03,920
So my molecule, pre-bodic molecule, what I think about the pre-bodic molecule, it's carbon

59
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:05,160
dioxide.

60
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:10,680
So we're bringing this material back up here, this water back up here, we get some fouling,

61
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:16,080
we get some frustration, we get this therefore becomes the kind of creative place for interaction

62
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:21,320
between the carbonic ocean and the hydrogen and this is where we would say hydrogenation

63
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:25,960
of carbon dioxide would start and if we kind of blow this up a bit we've got our iron sulfide

64
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:31,240
and iron nickel sulfides, the iron by the way coming out of this reservoir of an ocean

65
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:37,200
and I'll explain that in a moment, some nickel, of course the CO2 and protons so we've got

66
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:42,400
even a proton gradient so we've got a proton motive force but also we've got things like

67
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:49,400
nitric oxide out here so we've actually got a redox gradient as well and the overall amount

68
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:54,360
of energy is about between half and one volt so it's a commensurate energy with what we

69
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:59,760
use today, so what life uses and we would suggest that life starts probably between

70
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:04,360
40 and 80 degrees centigrade in such a system, a compartmentalized system.

71
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:08,440
So I call this a two compartment entropy trap because we've had one compartment up here

72
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:14,520
which was of course the open ocean and then we can differentiate that water and bring

73
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:20,080
back the water and now we've got an entropy trap because we've got these two fluids constantly

74
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:26,460
interacting with each other.

75
00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:32,020
So here's this turbulent water world, the Hadian water world, it's a single compartment

76
00:05:32,020 --> 00:05:37,820
as I say, it's got eight times the amount of UV present day that you wouldn't want to

77
00:05:37,820 --> 00:05:42,060
be on the surface of this planet, I mean it's really a hopeless place to be, there's no

78
00:05:42,060 --> 00:05:48,260
land to stop the hurricanes, it's continually out of physical equilibrium as well as chemical

79
00:05:48,260 --> 00:05:53,420
equilibrium so it's a turbulent world, the Hadian water world as I say and it's being

80
00:05:53,420 --> 00:06:01,340
impacted of course by bolides and after the lunar impact the ocean probably rained out

81
00:06:01,340 --> 00:06:05,960
around about 4.4 billion years ago and life would have started very shortly thereafter

82
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:10,880
and it would be very hard to kill after that and I think that life probably started around

83
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:14,760
about 4.4 and kept going.

84
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:18,740
So we know now and of course we're getting yet another experience of this from Iceland

85
00:06:18,740 --> 00:06:23,380
that here's the volcano, this is last year's volcano from Iceland and of course out comes

86
00:06:23,380 --> 00:06:29,220
this carbon dioxide, some hydrogen sulfide, sulfur dioxide, trioxide, nitric oxide, plenty

87
00:06:29,220 --> 00:06:34,740
of nitric oxide not just because of the lightning but because nitric oxide is stable in this

88
00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:36,340
magmatic material.

89
00:06:36,340 --> 00:06:41,740
There's an interesting crossover geochemically so that really carbon, the state of carbon

90
00:06:41,740 --> 00:06:46,900
in the mantle at low temperature would like to be methane but around about four or five

91
00:06:46,980 --> 00:06:51,300
hundred degrees centigrade is a crossover between the redox condition of iron two to

92
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:57,020
iron three and carbon methane to carbon dioxide so at high temperature you always get carbon

93
00:06:57,020 --> 00:06:58,020
dioxide.

94
00:06:58,020 --> 00:07:02,740
In fact geologists since Darwin have always known that the early atmosphere of this planet

95
00:07:02,740 --> 00:07:06,660
was carbon dioxide.

96
00:07:06,660 --> 00:07:12,580
So here's our earth and as I say it's oxidized on the outside, it's even probably got some

97
00:07:12,580 --> 00:07:16,700
ferric iron and yet the interior is reduced.

98
00:07:16,700 --> 00:07:23,700
It's in fact a little bit of native iron and some ferrous iron and that's the material

99
00:07:23,700 --> 00:07:26,940
that basically is oxidized by water to generate the hydrogen.

100
00:07:26,940 --> 00:07:32,420
So hydrogen becomes the carrier gas if you like of the electrons from the interior and

101
00:07:32,420 --> 00:07:38,420
actually it's a bit like an autotrophic bacterium, it just doesn't do the job fast enough but

102
00:07:38,420 --> 00:07:42,740
it does make some methane as we know.

103
00:07:42,740 --> 00:07:46,700
So we could think of this and I don't want to take this two series because I don't think

104
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:52,940
methanogens were very early anymore but basically here's the reaction and the world can do it

105
00:07:52,940 --> 00:07:57,980
pretty well geochemically, hydrogen plus CO2 makes methane plus water.

106
00:07:57,980 --> 00:08:03,180
So we can think of this a bit like a methanogen, here's the methanogen or an electrochemical

107
00:08:03,180 --> 00:08:07,340
cell, the output as I say between half and one volt.

108
00:08:07,340 --> 00:08:11,380
So what we'd suggest then is can we imagine life kind of bubbling off from the surface

109
00:08:11,380 --> 00:08:17,700
of the planet and here we suggest that just as a bubble, here's the kind of inorganic

110
00:08:17,700 --> 00:08:24,620
membrane that I hope to show you, inside is very low pH conditions, sorry very high pH

111
00:08:24,620 --> 00:08:29,900
conditions, very low hydroxyl, very high hydroxyl amounts and on the outside you've got the

112
00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:35,300
protons from the protonic ocean or the carbonic ocean and so we've got a kind of entropy

113
00:08:35,300 --> 00:08:41,280
trap here because we've got order, continual order between the inside and the outside.

114
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:45,460
This is reduced and this is somewhat oxidized on the outside and as I say it's a rather

115
00:08:45,460 --> 00:08:52,100
like bacterium except that bacterium transports the protons out of the cell to come back in

116
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:58,260
to drive things like ATP whereas we don't need to drive that system because it's out

117
00:08:58,260 --> 00:08:59,860
here as part of the initial condition.

118
00:08:59,860 --> 00:09:05,460
So the initial conditions we would say favor metabolism right from the start.

119
00:09:05,460 --> 00:09:08,940
So here we have it again from Schrodinger order, from order.

120
00:09:08,940 --> 00:09:15,780
You can't have, you don't want a hypercyclic, you don't want to drag life out of a chaotic

121
00:09:15,780 --> 00:09:20,500
mess, you need to have direct delivery and there's one thing that if you're not a geologist

122
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:25,620
or don't know any geology, the one thing I'd like to remember as a rock type and that is

123
00:09:26,260 --> 00:09:31,380
sub-pentanization and so this is sub-pentanide and you're going to see a few slides of this,

124
00:09:31,380 --> 00:09:36,140
you've all seen it in shop windows and so forth on the sides of shop windows.

125
00:09:36,140 --> 00:09:40,580
You can see how fractured it is, this is a kind of little engines of generation of hydrogen

126
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:46,740
actually as the water permeates through this rock and sub-pentanizes what is the crust and

127
00:09:46,740 --> 00:09:51,820
this is why in a kind of analogy with Maxwell's demon, this is the demon that makes the difference

128
00:09:51,860 --> 00:09:57,340
between this fluid, sorry, this fluid and this fluid, the sub-pentanization reaction.

129
00:09:57,340 --> 00:10:05,580
So just to remind us that this is the United Nations building, by the way JPL said I really

130
00:10:05,580 --> 00:10:07,540
shouldn't show this side because it was political.

131
00:10:07,540 --> 00:10:12,060
Well I mean here's the president so I think it's beyond politics but anyway here's our

132
00:10:12,060 --> 00:10:18,180
sub-pentanide it's as you, I'm sure you've become aware of this rock type and what we're

133
00:10:18,220 --> 00:10:23,100
looking at is something called olivine plus water, basically here's olivine, magnesium

134
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:29,660
iron silicate plus water, generate some silica, some magnetite so we've oxidized the iron

135
00:10:29,660 --> 00:10:35,860
now, magnesium and calcium go into solution to give you the hydroxyl, the alkaline fluid

136
00:10:35,860 --> 00:10:39,060
and hydrogen in solution.

137
00:10:39,060 --> 00:10:43,940
And if there's carbon dioxide, some a little bit of methane and this is the pathway, the

138
00:10:43,940 --> 00:10:49,420
geochemical pathway, it goes from CO2, basically it goes pretty fast to methane, or fairly

139
00:10:49,420 --> 00:10:54,900
fast to methane, although you can see some of them, you can get formate in the reactions

140
00:10:54,900 --> 00:10:59,460
so you can find this in a hot spring, typically hot spring, nothing to do with life at all,

141
00:10:59,460 --> 00:11:04,060
will generate methane and you'll have a little bit of formate, you don't see any methyl alcohol

142
00:11:04,060 --> 00:11:10,620
that seems to be pretty unstable and go to the methane.

143
00:11:11,540 --> 00:11:15,420
We've talked about the methane and I've just said that I don't think that this was an early

144
00:11:15,420 --> 00:11:19,740
reaction for biology, but nevertheless it's kind of there in the wings, the reaction that

145
00:11:19,740 --> 00:11:26,180
really takes place I think is the hydrogen plus the CO2 to acetate, so basically acetate,

146
00:11:26,180 --> 00:11:31,980
it's CO2 plus CH4 by the way, makes you acetate, so here's, to me this is the key reaction

147
00:11:31,980 --> 00:11:38,900
and in our lab we can never make this, we've never been able to make this chemically, so

148
00:11:39,060 --> 00:11:44,340
we think that this really was the job for life and so that thereby hangs the tale that

149
00:11:44,340 --> 00:11:49,740
we think that life, the beginnings of life was something that was a kind of microbe

150
00:11:49,740 --> 00:11:54,340
that was an acetogen, something that generated acetate from carbon, oxide and hydrogen.

151
00:11:54,340 --> 00:11:58,220
So we heard about the black smokers this morning, here they are and of course when, as soon

152
00:11:58,220 --> 00:12:02,260
as they were discovered, they were predicted by somebody by Jack Corliss and John Edmund

153
00:12:02,260 --> 00:12:08,260
were with Jack Corliss when these were discovered, predicted by the way in the Pacific at 360

154
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:12,020
degrees centigrade, of course the first thing to come to their mind was well maybe life

155
00:12:12,020 --> 00:12:16,180
started here, Stanley Miller didn't like that and wrote a letter to Nature saying it was

156
00:12:16,180 --> 00:12:20,740
ludicrous to think life could start at 400 or 360 degrees centigrade, I mean yeah I agree

157
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:25,300
with them, but interestingly there wouldn't have been black smokers on the early earth,

158
00:12:25,300 --> 00:12:29,740
there'd been many more of these springs but they would have been 400 degrees centigrade

159
00:12:29,740 --> 00:12:33,380
but they wouldn't be black smoke because the only reason why you've got black smoke here

160
00:12:33,380 --> 00:12:37,860
is because it's acidic, hot solution, it's not because it's cooling, it's because it's

161
00:12:37,860 --> 00:12:41,380
interacting with the alkaline seawater so you get the precipitation of this kind of

162
00:12:41,380 --> 00:12:47,740
so-called black smoke which are things like iron, zinc, manganese, oxides and nickel and

163
00:12:47,740 --> 00:12:53,300
a little bit of cobalt, so this basically they provide the trace elements into the early

164
00:12:53,300 --> 00:12:58,380
ocean and that becomes a reservoir, perhaps a super saturated reservoir of just the kind

165
00:12:58,380 --> 00:13:03,740
of metals we require for the first enzymes.

166
00:13:03,740 --> 00:13:07,660
So we've seen this, so this I'm not sure if you can get this, this is the ocean floor

167
00:13:07,660 --> 00:13:13,700
spreading, here's the actual spreading axis here and right here we've got the magma, here's

168
00:13:13,700 --> 00:13:18,060
the magma chamber so the water comes down to just about its critical point, perhaps a little

169
00:13:18,060 --> 00:13:22,700
bit higher, becomes very buoyant, shoots back up and as I think Jennifer said you know

170
00:13:22,700 --> 00:13:28,540
they only last for about 10 to 100 years so that's not very long and let's say they're

171
00:13:28,620 --> 00:13:34,260
up to 400 degrees centigrade, so it can't be here but we've been working in mineral

172
00:13:34,260 --> 00:13:41,260
deposits in Ireland and Alpine ultromethic provinces as called so we assume that there

173
00:13:43,860 --> 00:13:50,220
should be other kinds of hot springs on the early earth and we predicted in 1989 that

174
00:13:50,220 --> 00:13:55,540
there should be alkaline springs and Fortune would have it, a PhD student was looking out

175
00:13:55,540 --> 00:13:59,620
of the submarine window as they were going to the mid-oceanic ridge, the mid-atlantic

176
00:13:59,620 --> 00:14:06,620
ridge and she saw that some kind of little wisps of white smoke material and she stopped

177
00:14:08,860 --> 00:14:12,260
the submarine, told Deb Callie and they went back and they found this extraordinary structure,

178
00:14:12,260 --> 00:14:17,620
it's still the only main one to be found so far but it's the Lost City submarine spring,

179
00:14:17,620 --> 00:14:23,180
it lasts for at least 30,000 years, pretty certainly 100,000 years so that's a 10 to

180
00:14:23,220 --> 00:14:28,220
the 17 microseconds and somebody also said yesterday or perhaps this morning that the

181
00:14:28,220 --> 00:14:32,380
interactions, the chemical interactions, we shouldn't think in our terms of us, our

182
00:14:32,380 --> 00:14:37,220
big bulky selves in our time, we should think in terms of how long it takes to make these

183
00:14:37,220 --> 00:14:42,060
chemical reactions so 10 to the power of 17 microseconds I would think is plenty of time

184
00:14:42,060 --> 00:14:48,260
for life to start. So what we got here, so we've got this made of calcium and magnesium

185
00:14:48,260 --> 00:14:54,940
hydroxide, it's up to 94 degrees centigrade, not too hot, 15 millimoles of hydrogen so

186
00:14:54,940 --> 00:15:01,940
that's plenty of fuel, up to 2 millimoles of methane and they make compartments so

187
00:15:02,940 --> 00:15:08,100
in the precipitation there's always, always these springs, whatever the kind, always generates

188
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:14,700
some hollow compartments where the fluid makes its way through in a kind of labyrinthine manner

189
00:15:14,780 --> 00:15:18,300
and some of them seal off and so forth and I think these compartments are all important

190
00:15:18,300 --> 00:15:23,460
because we must have compartments I think for metabolism to make any sense, not only

191
00:15:23,460 --> 00:15:29,340
to keep the goodies so to speak inside but also to use those gradients which are pH gradients,

192
00:15:29,340 --> 00:15:36,340
redox gradients and of course even a temperature gradient. So here's, this is geochemistry

193
00:15:36,900 --> 00:15:42,740
and one thing to say about it is if it was geochemically easy to make, to reduce carbon

194
00:15:42,740 --> 00:15:49,220
dioxide to methane, there would be no life, no requirement for it, it's a very fact that

195
00:15:49,220 --> 00:15:56,220
it's such an uphill task to add an electron to CO2 and then reduce it to formate and formaldehyde

196
00:15:56,740 --> 00:16:02,020
and then once you've got there, downhill it goes but because of this life can come in

197
00:16:02,020 --> 00:16:07,860
here as the catalyst to bring us up to formate or formaldehyde and then downhill, it's like,

198
00:16:07,860 --> 00:16:14,860
it's a kind of geochemical siphon. So, and here's what the methalogens do, so they make

199
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:22,100
it easier, catalysis lowers the activation energy required for the reaction and also

200
00:16:22,100 --> 00:16:29,180
an ionic gradient is required to help CO2 be reduced to formate and then after that

201
00:16:29,180 --> 00:16:34,260
it's fairly well downhill but it's very complicated to get energy out of this so I don't think

202
00:16:34,260 --> 00:16:40,060
that this was, the methalogens were not eaten early but we think the acetogens were. So

203
00:16:40,060 --> 00:16:45,180
the acetogens now, they don't need an ionic gradient so much, well except in a sense

204
00:16:45,180 --> 00:16:50,860
they need ATP or adenosine triphosphate and it's adenosine triphosphate that drives the

205
00:16:50,860 --> 00:16:56,500
CO2 up to formate and formaldehyde and methylene and then downhill and then you add a methyl

206
00:16:56,500 --> 00:17:02,500
group to carbon monoxide which is reduced elsewhere and you end up with acetate which

207
00:17:02,580 --> 00:17:07,580
of course can take you on a pyruvate and eventually can aminate by the way all these reactions

208
00:17:07,580 --> 00:17:14,580
taking place most easily in alkaline solution. So here, you put it all together and let's

209
00:17:14,580 --> 00:17:18,660
think of this, you can think of this in all kinds of ways, it's the fractionation column,

210
00:17:18,660 --> 00:17:23,740
it's a hydrothermal flow reactor and so, but what I've done is kind of dress it up as one

211
00:17:23,740 --> 00:17:28,780
structure here but let me just remind you that here's, here are the reduced molecules

212
00:17:28,780 --> 00:17:33,740
coming out, there's hydrogen of course, a little bit of methane, some ammonia, molybdenum

213
00:17:33,740 --> 00:17:38,660
sulfide, soluble in alkaline solution as in, as our tungsten oxide which I think is pretty

214
00:17:38,660 --> 00:17:44,260
significant because we, all life seems to require this molybdenum and tungsten at this

215
00:17:44,260 --> 00:17:50,980
early stage of reduction and what I've plotted here really is basically the acetyl coenzyme

216
00:17:50,980 --> 00:17:56,700
A pathway. So the CO2 comes from the outside, we think that we need some ferric ion or maybe

217
00:17:56,700 --> 00:18:04,140
nitrate out here to help to oxidize the reduced molybdenum site so you lose an electron from

218
00:18:04,140 --> 00:18:08,140
molybdenum from molybdenum 4 to molybdenum 5 and then you've got a very energetic electron

219
00:18:08,140 --> 00:18:13,380
which can then reduce the CO2 and once you've done that then you're off on the, on that

220
00:18:13,380 --> 00:18:22,300
pathway up through onto a cobalt enzyme which will take the methyl group onto acetyl coenzyme

221
00:18:22,300 --> 00:18:26,260
synthase itself which is a nickel bearing enzyme, notice the importance of metals in

222
00:18:26,260 --> 00:18:33,820
here, we've already required molybdenum, iron, of course iron sulfides as well and the cobalt

223
00:18:33,820 --> 00:18:40,860
and the nickel and once we've got here then that the acetate can be taken either by what

224
00:18:40,860 --> 00:18:48,500
is now the synthase, the thiol group and the thiol can then be phosphorylated to, to generate

225
00:18:49,060 --> 00:18:55,420
acetyl phosphate and the phosphate can then with the help of other phosphate from outside

226
00:18:55,420 --> 00:19:06,020
be, help to generate pyrophosphate from monophosphate so this in the acetyl coenzyme pathway is

227
00:19:06,020 --> 00:19:14,580
ADP to ATP, here we're using just monophosphate or orthophosphate to go to pyrophosphate

228
00:19:14,660 --> 00:19:23,380
and that then feeds into general biosynthesis, acetogenic biosynthesis, I should say that

229
00:19:23,380 --> 00:19:27,940
there's also a methyl group here and I think that methanotrophy was probably early as well

230
00:19:27,940 --> 00:19:34,740
and what was the oxidant for methanotrophy, probably nitric oxide on nitrate, so we've

231
00:19:34,740 --> 00:19:39,180
got two different kinds of schemes here, one basically doing the main job for the world

232
00:19:39,180 --> 00:19:45,100
and that's spending the hydrogen fuel and a little bit on the side spending the methyl

233
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:50,900
fuel, so what do we do with this, well we can take it into the lab and we can put a hydrothermal

234
00:19:50,900 --> 00:19:56,020
solution on one side and ocean water on the other and we can mix them, we can heat them

235
00:19:56,020 --> 00:20:02,500
up to 100 degrees centigrade, we can put them into a central reactor here with ultramafic

236
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:06,820
rock just like what's in the crust of the earth or the crust of Mars indeed or what

237
00:20:06,860 --> 00:20:11,660
was Venus, all the same rock with a little bit of sulfide and out comes the fluid, we

238
00:20:11,660 --> 00:20:15,780
then take this fluid and we take it to another lab and this is in the other lab and we inject

239
00:20:15,780 --> 00:20:20,100
this fluid into what we think of as a Hadean ocean which we had a little bit of ferrous

240
00:20:20,100 --> 00:20:25,180
chloride in up to perhaps 10 millimoles from those very hot springs, this kind of somewhat

241
00:20:25,180 --> 00:20:31,580
acidic ocean and we get this immediate precipitation, oftentimes sulfide, a little bit of silica

242
00:20:31,780 --> 00:20:36,860
and so on and what we, in that reactor we find we can make methane within actually just

243
00:20:36,860 --> 00:20:41,860
about 10 hours, we've got 16 parts per million by volume, so this is an eight biotic reaction,

244
00:20:41,860 --> 00:20:46,700
very easy to do and I think early life couldn't compete with geochemistry in this case. The

245
00:20:46,700 --> 00:20:51,260
hydrogen sulfide goes up to about 14 millimoles and then down to about 1 to 2 millimoles but

246
00:20:51,260 --> 00:20:56,980
again enough to precipitate such a membrane, here just to remind us is the sub-pentanization,

247
00:20:56,980 --> 00:21:02,380
the requirement of sub-pentanization. So what do they look like? So we can now say

248
00:21:02,380 --> 00:21:08,740
here's our main model, we're getting used to this now, now we know that we've got an

249
00:21:08,740 --> 00:21:13,540
actual mound, a hydrothermal mound that's got compartments in it, here are the kind

250
00:21:13,540 --> 00:21:17,220
of compartments, this is a chimney, within the chimney you get these small compartments

251
00:21:17,220 --> 00:21:22,780
made of iron sulfide or ferrous hydroxide or oxyhydroxide with plenty of what looks

252
00:21:22,780 --> 00:21:28,820
like catalytic surface to my mind anyway. So this is now the sequence and what we've

253
00:21:28,820 --> 00:21:33,020
got here also is a propensity for waste, we can dispose of the waste, the things that

254
00:21:33,020 --> 00:21:39,900
do not play, the molecules that do not interact can just be taken off as waste and of course

255
00:21:39,900 --> 00:21:45,060
just like life itself, this is an entropy generator but ordering, there is ordering

256
00:21:45,060 --> 00:21:51,460
going on within these structures but outside then entropy is generated through the waste,

257
00:21:51,460 --> 00:21:56,580
polythermal, polychemical. So putting the whole thing together again, making it slightly

258
00:21:56,580 --> 00:22:03,020
more reasonable to look at, here's our hydrothermal mound, submarine hydrothermal mound, it's being

259
00:22:03,020 --> 00:22:08,620
fed with hydrogen sulfide, hydrogen ammonia, milliptin and tungsten, up to 120 degrees

260
00:22:08,620 --> 00:22:13,620
centigrade pH 11 coming into this somewhat acidic ocean with all these electron acceptors

261
00:22:13,620 --> 00:22:19,380
on the outside and the metals and phosphate and precipitating structures that are rather

262
00:22:19,420 --> 00:22:25,260
similar, mineral structures that are rather similar to the active centers of enzymes and

263
00:22:25,260 --> 00:22:31,060
just to emphasize this point one more time, here's the protons on the outside and we speculate

264
00:22:31,060 --> 00:22:40,060
that the protons can basically drive monophosphate, phosphorylation to diphosphate or perhaps

265
00:22:40,060 --> 00:22:45,020
through acetyl phosphate. So here's our proton motive force, it's all there, everything

266
00:22:45,260 --> 00:22:51,660
you require for early life is there, all the metals, all the energy. So what I want to

267
00:22:51,660 --> 00:22:56,780
emphasize is that biochemistry isn't just better geochemistry, there really is a discontinuity

268
00:22:56,780 --> 00:23:02,140
and that discontinuity because people have been very unsuccessful in generating I think

269
00:23:02,140 --> 00:23:07,900
organic molecules because they think that all you have to do is get the recipe right,

270
00:23:07,900 --> 00:23:11,780
the chemical recipe and we'll get life. I don't think so, we've got to have that proton

271
00:23:11,820 --> 00:23:20,820
motive force and redox gradients. So we can go to Gunter Vectors Heuser and Claudia Huber

272
00:23:20,820 --> 00:23:26,580
for perhaps one of the first interesting structures. Now this isn't so good as it looks I admit

273
00:23:26,580 --> 00:23:31,940
but what he's taken is a methyl group and a carbon monoxide and shown that on nickel ion

274
00:23:31,940 --> 00:23:40,940
sulfide and indeed even nickel sulfate or nickel sulfide then he can make acetyl thioacidate

275
00:23:40,940 --> 00:23:46,940
basically and hydrogen sulfide. He's done this at pH 6.4 which is very nice little spike here,

276
00:23:46,940 --> 00:23:50,940
we haven't been able to reproduce that but that could be our failing but you could see that

277
00:23:50,940 --> 00:23:56,620
actually it's very well satisfied this kind of reaction at pretty high pH. So again I want

278
00:23:56,620 --> 00:24:02,700
to emphasize just how many of these reactions are promoted by alkaline conditions. So we take

279
00:24:02,700 --> 00:24:08,700
a closer look at our membranes, our structures made in the lab and there are some peculiarities

280
00:24:08,700 --> 00:24:13,820
to it and of course anybody's got any ideas about this I'd welcome them but here this is the kind

281
00:24:13,820 --> 00:24:17,660
of membrane so we're inside the membrane here this is and you can see these love what are called

282
00:24:17,660 --> 00:24:24,220
framboids it's kind of raspberry shaped ion sulfides that grow on the inside then here we've

283
00:24:24,220 --> 00:24:29,820
got a mixture of ion monosulfide and something called Gregite Fe3S4 and on the outside is what

284
00:24:29,820 --> 00:24:36,460
the outside looks like absolutely extraordinary ordering of the outside and indeed even the

285
00:24:36,460 --> 00:24:41,500
inside looks like this and we thought that might be kind of claddeny plate material we're just not

286
00:24:41,500 --> 00:24:46,140
I don't know why these make such beautiful structures I mean they're much more beautiful

287
00:24:46,780 --> 00:24:53,820
and reliable and then waves on a beach in sand and we would say that most of the action takes

288
00:24:53,820 --> 00:24:58,620
place here the alkaline flow goes out the acidic counter flow comes in and most of the

289
00:24:59,660 --> 00:25:05,180
organic interactions or organic synthesis we would argue would be happening actually within

290
00:25:05,180 --> 00:25:11,580
the membrane this membrane's about five to ten microns across pretty wide for a membrane and it's

291
00:25:11,580 --> 00:25:16,940
inorganic so if we look again at this what what are the structures of the elements or the the

292
00:25:16,940 --> 00:25:21,420
minerals that make make this well look the main mineral to precipitate is something called mechanawad

293
00:25:21,420 --> 00:25:26,460
and it's made here it is an ion sulfa ion sulfur rom basically you put this together in such a way

294
00:25:26,460 --> 00:25:32,220
that it makes for something that's actually a pretty good electron conductor in that direction

295
00:25:32,300 --> 00:25:37,820
and a very good insulator in this direction it's it's uh so we've got a semi permeable and a

296
00:25:37,820 --> 00:25:42,060
semi conducting membrane so this is one of the chimneys here's here's a chimney again and this

297
00:25:42,060 --> 00:25:46,940
is kind of a little offshoot little compartment here and here are subcompoundments within the

298
00:25:46,940 --> 00:25:54,140
membrane itself now if you look at that mechanawad how similar it is to the actual active center of

299
00:25:54,140 --> 00:25:59,020
hydrogenase and one thing we need to do is if you've got H2 you've got to split into two electrons

300
00:25:59,020 --> 00:26:04,540
and two protons so and this is what hydrogenase does and here here's a structure ion sulfur ion

301
00:26:04,540 --> 00:26:10,860
sulfur so similar of course to this structure here so could it be that this was the first

302
00:26:11,900 --> 00:26:17,660
hydrogenase it doesn't not a very effective one but effective enough and not only that could it be

303
00:26:17,660 --> 00:26:23,020
that it's ready for co-option so that if it were to be co-opted by a short peptide maybe that would

304
00:26:23,020 --> 00:26:31,820
make it even slightly more active so we if you have this at 80 degrees centigrade this hydrothermal

305
00:26:31,820 --> 00:26:36,540
chimney then within about two or three days sometimes sooner you get the generation of

306
00:26:36,540 --> 00:26:43,100
something called gregite which is fv well it should be fv5 ni s8 oftentimes there's not nickel

307
00:26:43,100 --> 00:26:48,540
there sometimes there is if the nickel is there and it's going to be in this tetrahedral side here

308
00:26:48,540 --> 00:26:53,020
so here we've got now we've put the two roms together so we've got ion sulfur ion sulfur and

309
00:26:53,020 --> 00:26:57,980
behind it ion sulfur ion sulfur through two sulfas to nickel so and this is just slightly

310
00:26:57,980 --> 00:27:02,540
oxidized and it's the ion that's oxidized not the sulfur so this is nothing to do with the

311
00:27:02,540 --> 00:27:07,180
pyrite hypothesis because that's the pyrite hypothesis it's a sulfur that gets oxidized but

312
00:27:07,180 --> 00:27:11,900
of course with it's much better i think if we have the ion going back from shall we say

313
00:27:12,620 --> 00:27:20,380
2 plus to 2.5 plus on average again here's the what the membrane looks like this made of this material

314
00:27:22,220 --> 00:27:26,860
and look how similar it is to acetylcoenzyme synthase which is kind of where we came in here's

315
00:27:26,860 --> 00:27:32,780
the nickel side through sulfur and here's now we've got a box or a cubane structure which is

316
00:27:32,780 --> 00:27:37,980
extraordinarily similar to the cubane structure in here so again we're wondering can this be

317
00:27:37,980 --> 00:27:45,500
the kind of structure that is actually acting as acetylcoenzyme synthase type in the in the

318
00:27:45,500 --> 00:27:52,220
vectus hyzer huba reaction so here we have those that kind of structure so what's next well of

319
00:27:52,220 --> 00:27:57,260
course what we need next because what's easy to make with and and as everybody's agreed RNA is

320
00:27:57,260 --> 00:28:03,260
hard to make almost impossible to make but but amino acids are easy to make in the lab so we would

321
00:28:03,260 --> 00:28:10,700
say that that's first and here again huba and vectus hyzer has made some amino acids in the lab

322
00:28:10,700 --> 00:28:19,100
and not only that they can amenate them and in this case they've amenated these various structures

323
00:28:20,300 --> 00:28:24,220
with either iron sulfide or ferrous hydroxide so that's the kind of thing that should be able to

324
00:28:24,220 --> 00:28:31,180
happen in our chimneys and they happen at pH 9 and the yield is extraordinary

325
00:28:33,340 --> 00:28:39,900
well if we can do that can can we if we if pyrophosphates available and and I should say that

326
00:28:39,900 --> 00:28:45,660
diswort and and Andy Pratt have produced pyrophosphate in the lab in a kind of substrate

327
00:28:45,660 --> 00:28:51,900
phosphorylation technique using ferrous iron as the catalyst and iron sulfide and and using that

328
00:28:52,940 --> 00:28:56,540
then yamanaka et al and others have managed to

329
00:28:57,100 --> 00:29:04,860
uh actually phosphoryte and then uh basically dimerize uh with trimetaphosphate in this case

330
00:29:04,860 --> 00:29:11,260
glycine to two glycines and that's pretty not a bad yield uh at about pH again right about pH 9

331
00:29:11,260 --> 00:29:17,660
if you lower the pH uh then after after 20 days or so you can get up to glycine 4 or glycine 6 now

332
00:29:17,660 --> 00:29:24,380
once you've got the glycine 6 that's getting quite useful anything before five four and six

333
00:29:24,380 --> 00:29:31,020
becomes useful and one possible function for these is that they could then through uh then the amine

334
00:29:31,020 --> 00:29:37,580
group uh directly bond to the delta negative on on the amine group things like cobalt and nickel

335
00:29:37,580 --> 00:29:44,780
and could these be very inefficient but basically kind of pigment peptides and could they do we

336
00:29:44,780 --> 00:29:49,980
know these structures exist uh they've never been shown to be active uh because I think they've never

337
00:29:49,980 --> 00:29:55,420
been tested in this way but could these be for example similar to a transfer site for acetal

338
00:29:55,420 --> 00:30:02,300
coenzyme synthase and uh and the site for reduction of the methyl group to to methane so we've got

339
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:08,300
structures again that everything as I say is kind of on the plate here uh so could we then have a

340
00:30:08,300 --> 00:30:14,220
beginning of a peptide takeover now nobody's shown this this is just paper chemistry as people

341
00:30:14,220 --> 00:30:20,860
would like to point out but here we'd suggest it could nevertheless ferredoxins are the uh according

342
00:30:20,860 --> 00:30:27,180
to Ecken Dayhoff in a wonderful paper in science in 1966 uh have the longest of all pedigrees of all

343
00:30:27,180 --> 00:30:33,180
metal proteins uh could it be the very first one was actually structured in a loop uh through

344
00:30:33,180 --> 00:30:39,260
hydrogen bonding through to that to a thylated ion sulfide so here's here's our cubane structure

345
00:30:39,260 --> 00:30:46,140
and here's the possibility of uh it's actually being thylated sorry uh hydrogen bonded to the

346
00:30:46,140 --> 00:30:51,740
backbone it notice it doesn't matter what the side chains are just the backbone of a short peptide

347
00:30:51,740 --> 00:30:56,460
now of course these days it's and probably fairly early on it's cysteines but cysteine is hard to

348
00:30:56,460 --> 00:31:01,420
make in the lab it may be there were no sulfur bearing amino acid side chains right at the

349
00:31:01,420 --> 00:31:07,100
beginning but you will notice if you people who worked on ferredoxins the ion sulfide is always

350
00:31:07,100 --> 00:31:15,660
in a loop so we'd say then uh working with uh Wolfgang Nitschke uh he's he's suggested and for

351
00:31:16,380 --> 00:31:21,020
various reasons including phylogenetics that the last universal common ancestor which we

352
00:31:21,020 --> 00:31:27,820
would put further back uh but nevertheless uh we'd say that the last universal common ancestor

353
00:31:27,820 --> 00:31:33,820
must have had millibitim di-terrin enzymes had nitric oxide, ridottes, nickel ion, hydrogenase

354
00:31:33,820 --> 00:31:39,100
and acetylcoenzyme synthase and carbon monoxide dehydrogenase which you have to have metals for

355
00:31:39,100 --> 00:31:43,660
this and we'd suggest the metals were right in there right at the beginning uh and eventually

356
00:31:43,660 --> 00:31:51,740
were co-opted so that all sounds part of that is airy fairy maybe but the earlier part I think uh

357
00:31:51,740 --> 00:31:57,660
it holds up well and now we've got the possibility that we've got a phosphate uh and we know we can

358
00:31:57,660 --> 00:32:03,100
see phosphate and pyrophosphate in these situations and that really would interact with the with the

359
00:32:03,100 --> 00:32:09,180
sidechain uh sorry the backbone of uh of short peptide to make a little peptide nest and and

360
00:32:09,180 --> 00:32:16,780
James Milner White and I call this a phosphate egg in in a in a peptide nest and this looks I think

361
00:32:16,780 --> 00:32:22,780
you'll agree very much like the P loop so here's the here's how we would dress that up but as a

362
00:32:22,780 --> 00:32:31,900
slightly longer peptide and we turn this in taking our cue from Enric and Margareta Balczewski we take

363
00:32:31,900 --> 00:32:38,300
the idea that perhaps uh they've the first kind of pyrophosphatase was a proton pyrophosphatase

364
00:32:38,300 --> 00:32:43,500
and that we could drive the generation of orthophosphate from pyrophosphate from

365
00:32:44,460 --> 00:32:52,860
orthophosphate by protons coming through the membrane and having a magnesium ion as the catalyst

366
00:32:52,860 --> 00:32:57,980
of course to because of the repulsion between the phosphates this is required but also this is a

367
00:32:57,980 --> 00:33:03,420
little kind of entropy uh to our mind kind of entropy catalyst as well holding things in because

368
00:33:03,420 --> 00:33:08,860
of the hydrogen bonding from the back of it from the amine group through to the oxygens on the

369
00:33:08,860 --> 00:33:15,180
phosphate so this would say perhaps this is what the early proton pyrophosphatase actually looked

370
00:33:15,180 --> 00:33:21,980
like and perhaps it was uh fired up basically by protons coming through the membrane from the acidic

371
00:33:21,980 --> 00:33:27,660
ocean so here we have the kind of rough equation for this magnesium phosphate plus the plus orthophosphate

372
00:33:27,660 --> 00:33:36,060
plus the proton to give us your magnesium diphosphate if we've got these short peptides what we've

373
00:33:36,060 --> 00:33:42,540
done here is to put four or five peptides actually in the hydrothermal solution the alkaline hydrothermal

374
00:33:42,540 --> 00:33:49,180
solution and when we do that we make even more better ordered structures and these structures are

375
00:33:49,740 --> 00:33:54,140
as you see just beautifully ribbed both inside and outside and glycine apparently gives us the

376
00:33:54,140 --> 00:34:01,180
best structure of all for reasons we don't understand so then we go back then to think

377
00:34:01,180 --> 00:34:06,940
where we've been with us and what we've done is to say take up an idea well a paper from Andrew's

378
00:34:06,940 --> 00:34:13,820
et al who could show that you could get mixed acid fermentation via formate hydrogen hydrogen liase

379
00:34:13,900 --> 00:34:19,500
and the reaction generates hydrogen and co2 from formate and protons and actually

380
00:34:19,500 --> 00:34:24,540
generates a proton motive force and it what is required here is uh one of these molybdenum

381
00:34:24,540 --> 00:34:31,020
enzymes and an iron iron sulfide factor as well and the nickel iron uh as well uh so what we've

382
00:34:31,020 --> 00:34:35,260
thought of and of course this is something we're trying to do in the lab uh is perhaps we could

383
00:34:35,260 --> 00:34:41,100
reduce it perhaps we can turn this around make the protons come inside using nickel iron sulfide

384
00:34:41,100 --> 00:34:46,940
and molybdenum as the as a catalyst and see if we can generate formate and and perhaps formaldehyde

385
00:34:47,740 --> 00:34:55,100
from the inside by reacting co2 and the protons and electrons to make the formate at pH 10 or pH

386
00:34:55,100 --> 00:35:01,660
9 or pH 10 so this becomes uh really uh holy grail that's one question we'd like to answer

387
00:35:03,180 --> 00:35:07,740
so what else does this kind of uh structure offer well we're not we don't know anything

388
00:35:08,700 --> 00:35:15,980
in detail about the RNA well but uh cunin and uh using cunin and cunin and martin and

389
00:35:15,980 --> 00:35:22,140
basket al have suggested that in fact if you've got structures like this then maybe the first RNAs

390
00:35:22,140 --> 00:35:30,220
wherever they come from act like viruses uh and uh basically can permeate through and start to make

391
00:35:30,940 --> 00:35:36,620
uh better replicators as we go through this the structure and but also if you were to make

392
00:35:37,340 --> 00:35:43,260
DNA in this in this series in in this way you could have a polymerase chain reaction which

393
00:35:43,260 --> 00:35:48,300
is run thermally or convectively because it's going to be cool on the outside and hot in the inside

394
00:35:48,300 --> 00:35:54,380
so you're going to have a convective polymerase chain reaction to build up shall we say uh DNA

395
00:35:54,380 --> 00:36:02,780
lengths and then thermophoresis or thermo uh thermal diffusion then tends to drive uh concentrated

396
00:36:03,900 --> 00:36:12,540
molecules that are that are ionic into basically into the coolest area of one of these compartments

397
00:36:12,540 --> 00:36:18,300
so so again we haven't just got the geotherm we haven't just got the redox gradient and the

398
00:36:18,300 --> 00:36:23,340
the pH gradient we've also got a thermal gradient that may help right at the beginning as you start

399
00:36:23,340 --> 00:36:31,340
to gain uh replication so this is the way then we would see the very emergence of life probably

400
00:36:31,340 --> 00:36:38,220
between 50 70 degrees centigrade 40 to 80 maybe uh hydrogen and methane as the fuels

401
00:36:38,220 --> 00:36:44,220
molybdenum tungsten absolutely required as catalysts along with iron iron nickel sulfides

402
00:36:45,340 --> 00:36:51,180
and perhaps the the first actual microbe which we would assume was a bacterium

403
00:36:52,140 --> 00:36:56,780
emanating from the spring not into the ocean by the way but down into the deep biosphere

404
00:36:57,580 --> 00:37:01,340
because i think it's basically a desert in the ocean and it's a dangerous desert as we've seen

405
00:37:02,380 --> 00:37:08,460
but these first this first uh microbes would be generating acetate or acetic acid and then

406
00:37:08,460 --> 00:37:15,180
there'd be some more minor reactions that would generate uh using nitric oxide as the electron

407
00:37:15,260 --> 00:37:22,620
acceptor uh carbon dioxide and nitrogen and water from this reaction uh and this would become to

408
00:37:22,620 --> 00:37:29,980
our minds the methanotroph the methanotrophic archaea so if we put all that together and we've

409
00:37:29,980 --> 00:37:36,780
heard other uh suggestions uh for example this morning about the big bang a big bang when i

410
00:37:36,780 --> 00:37:42,460
go to parties people ask me what i do and i you know i i kind of finally cough if they really seem

411
00:37:42,460 --> 00:37:47,100
to be interested and i tell them i'm working on the origin alive i see them six months later

412
00:37:47,100 --> 00:37:51,260
and they always seem to say oh you're the guy working on the big bang and it kind of pushed

413
00:37:51,260 --> 00:37:56,860
us in to this idea that you know we make the comparison and uh with shaw and carol on hand

414
00:37:57,820 --> 00:38:03,020
he wrote this lovely book called from attorney to here which the older people in the audience

415
00:38:03,020 --> 00:38:07,980
will understand there's a pretty good title and if he starts with a big bang and uh it's a very high

416
00:38:08,780 --> 00:38:14,540
enthalpy low entropy big bang and here we are now and we do the same thing we'd have a big bang

417
00:38:14,540 --> 00:38:19,900
we go from geochemistry to biochemistry but we can't just segue one from the other you you've

418
00:38:19,900 --> 00:38:24,460
got to go through this discontinuity and what helps us through the discontinuity we would say

419
00:38:24,460 --> 00:38:30,620
is the the proton motive force and chemiosmosis which are on tap in in the situation and then

420
00:38:30,620 --> 00:38:36,140
after that uh we get this various evolutions parts of evolution part of which has been covered by

421
00:38:36,140 --> 00:38:42,860
others of course this is huge yawning gap between metabolism and uh and replication and and we don't

422
00:38:42,860 --> 00:38:47,500
deny that one thing i would say though and and that is that nearly everybody that's been talking

423
00:38:47,500 --> 00:38:53,820
about RNA and DNA and uh enzymes are on the other side of a canyon for me i admit that but we can

424
00:38:53,820 --> 00:38:57,980
see each other from either side we're not that down there or up there we've got there is a lot

425
00:38:57,980 --> 00:39:03,420
in common between mineralogy and geochemistry and the very fact of the initial conditions

426
00:39:03,420 --> 00:39:10,700
that uh i think will eventually allow us to converge uh and just to emphasize that you know

427
00:39:10,700 --> 00:39:16,540
we've got 10 to the power of 17 microseconds and i really do think that's enough time for

428
00:39:16,540 --> 00:39:23,820
life to emerge imagine what 200 postdocs could do for you in that amount of time uh 24 7 of

429
00:39:23,820 --> 00:39:35,260
course 365 as usual that's it thank you very much
