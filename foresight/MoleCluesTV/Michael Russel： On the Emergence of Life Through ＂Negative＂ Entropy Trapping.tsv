0	17060	Well, we've just heard some wonderful lectures on RNA, coding, replication, evolution, but
17060	22260	we still have this problem about what was the first engine and indeed what was its fuel.
22260	27340	So I'm going to suggest that we should think about what life does rather than what it is
27340	28720	to understand that.
28720	30860	And what does life do?
30860	33700	It hydrogenates carbon dioxide.
33700	38300	Right down the bottom of the food chain and probably down the bottom of the evolutionary
38300	41620	tree it hydrogenates carbon dioxide.
41620	47720	So presumably that's how it started.
47720	52660	So here's what I'd like to also emphasize and people have already worried me about
52660	58220	the remark about entropy, but I think we shouldn't forget this wonderful book by Schrodinger.
58220	60920	To me there were two wonderful books about the origin of life.
60920	66260	One's worth reading and it's by Le Duc and by the way it's a century when it was published.
66260	69180	It was published in 1911 and really it's worth a read.
69180	73660	He had the Nianst equation, all the kind of things in it that in fact I'm going to allude
73660	78420	to, the only thing he didn't have was an alkaline spring.
78420	83260	Without taking the other book, of course, that is what is life and that's from Schrodinger,
83260	87500	I'd just like to emphasize he kept on saying what does life do?
87500	91020	It drinks orderliness from a suitable environment.
91020	93780	So yeah, let's find with this suitable environment.
93780	95140	What is a suitable environment?
95140	98020	It's got to offer us everything, all in one place.
98020	99980	We don't want any contingencies.
99980	104280	It's got to be right there, nothing, no false pleas.
104280	108720	So our suggestion then is basically we're looking at an earth which is a water world
108720	112240	and I'm going to go back on to that but there's probably at least twice as much water on the
112240	114360	early earth, probably more than that.
114360	115560	There is no land.
115560	120160	The day lasts about 12 hours, the moon's much closer, the galaxy's probably much closer
120160	122200	and the other galaxies are closer.
122200	126240	This is a different planet, don't think this planet, think another planet.
126240	130560	It's a third of the age of the universe ago and of course we've got the water covering
130560	131560	the planet.
131560	133160	It's a pretty oxidized surface, don't forget.
133160	138360	It's H2O and CO2 and without photosynthesis you can't do much better than that.
138360	143680	So we've got an oxidized exterior and we've got one compartment on this planet of water.
143680	151560	But we need to think about how we could get some tension on the planet because after all
151560	160640	what we have is water we know can descend into the planet and in fact oxidize the surface
160640	166520	or the near surface, oxidize it, carbonate it and hydrate it so much so that this water
166520	172320	up here which probably supports up to 10 bars of carbon dioxide and maybe more, don't forget
172320	176120	Venus has 90 atmospheres of carbon dioxide so we're not claiming much and as somebody
176120	179120	said yesterday Mars has a carbon dioxide atmosphere.
179120	180840	That's what these planets are like.
180840	185000	At high temperature through volcanoes you get carbon dioxide so that's the exterior
185000	187320	but the interior is electron rich.
187320	192440	One comes the water and suddenly we're getting a differentiation of this seawater which was
192440	197400	somewhat acidic up here, carbonic if you like, it comes down and it comes back up and it's
197400	198400	quite different now.
198400	203520	It's got a pH of about 11, it's got quite a lot of hydrogen so that's our fuel, it's
203520	208400	our favorite fuel after all, what we're all trying to aim for, some methane, not such a
208400	210440	bad fuel and some formate.
210440	214280	So this is coming up now and it's like a titration.
214280	218080	This water now is going to come out, there's five pH units different, it's going to come
218080	223600	up and it's going to titrate into this ocean but as many of you, at least when I was young
223600	228920	doing buretting you'd know that out of a burette or even a pipette you'd get some fouling
228920	232640	and here we've got some fouling and it's inorganic fouling.
232640	237200	This is all about an inorganic world to start with.
237200	243920	So my molecule, pre-bodic molecule, what I think about the pre-bodic molecule, it's carbon
243920	245160	dioxide.
245160	250680	So we're bringing this material back up here, this water back up here, we get some fouling,
250680	256080	we get some frustration, we get this therefore becomes the kind of creative place for interaction
256080	261320	between the carbonic ocean and the hydrogen and this is where we would say hydrogenation
261320	265960	of carbon dioxide would start and if we kind of blow this up a bit we've got our iron sulfide
265960	271240	and iron nickel sulfides, the iron by the way coming out of this reservoir of an ocean
271240	277200	and I'll explain that in a moment, some nickel, of course the CO2 and protons so we've got
277200	282400	even a proton gradient so we've got a proton motive force but also we've got things like
282400	289400	nitric oxide out here so we've actually got a redox gradient as well and the overall amount
289400	294360	of energy is about between half and one volt so it's a commensurate energy with what we
294360	299760	use today, so what life uses and we would suggest that life starts probably between
299760	304360	40 and 80 degrees centigrade in such a system, a compartmentalized system.
304360	308440	So I call this a two compartment entropy trap because we've had one compartment up here
308440	314520	which was of course the open ocean and then we can differentiate that water and bring
314520	320080	back the water and now we've got an entropy trap because we've got these two fluids constantly
320080	326460	interacting with each other.
326460	332020	So here's this turbulent water world, the Hadian water world, it's a single compartment
332020	337820	as I say, it's got eight times the amount of UV present day that you wouldn't want to
337820	342060	be on the surface of this planet, I mean it's really a hopeless place to be, there's no
342060	348260	land to stop the hurricanes, it's continually out of physical equilibrium as well as chemical
348260	353420	equilibrium so it's a turbulent world, the Hadian water world as I say and it's being
353420	361340	impacted of course by bolides and after the lunar impact the ocean probably rained out
361340	365960	around about 4.4 billion years ago and life would have started very shortly thereafter
365960	370880	and it would be very hard to kill after that and I think that life probably started around
370880	374760	about 4.4 and kept going.
374760	378740	So we know now and of course we're getting yet another experience of this from Iceland
378740	383380	that here's the volcano, this is last year's volcano from Iceland and of course out comes
383380	389220	this carbon dioxide, some hydrogen sulfide, sulfur dioxide, trioxide, nitric oxide, plenty
389220	394740	of nitric oxide not just because of the lightning but because nitric oxide is stable in this
394740	396340	magmatic material.
396340	401740	There's an interesting crossover geochemically so that really carbon, the state of carbon
401740	406900	in the mantle at low temperature would like to be methane but around about four or five
406980	411300	hundred degrees centigrade is a crossover between the redox condition of iron two to
411300	417020	iron three and carbon methane to carbon dioxide so at high temperature you always get carbon
417020	418020	dioxide.
418020	422740	In fact geologists since Darwin have always known that the early atmosphere of this planet
422740	426660	was carbon dioxide.
426660	432580	So here's our earth and as I say it's oxidized on the outside, it's even probably got some
432580	436700	ferric iron and yet the interior is reduced.
436700	443700	It's in fact a little bit of native iron and some ferrous iron and that's the material
443700	446940	that basically is oxidized by water to generate the hydrogen.
446940	452420	So hydrogen becomes the carrier gas if you like of the electrons from the interior and
452420	458420	actually it's a bit like an autotrophic bacterium, it just doesn't do the job fast enough but
458420	462740	it does make some methane as we know.
462740	466700	So we could think of this and I don't want to take this two series because I don't think
466700	472940	methanogens were very early anymore but basically here's the reaction and the world can do it
472940	477980	pretty well geochemically, hydrogen plus CO2 makes methane plus water.
477980	483180	So we can think of this a bit like a methanogen, here's the methanogen or an electrochemical
483180	487340	cell, the output as I say between half and one volt.
487340	491380	So what we'd suggest then is can we imagine life kind of bubbling off from the surface
491380	497700	of the planet and here we suggest that just as a bubble, here's the kind of inorganic
497700	504620	membrane that I hope to show you, inside is very low pH conditions, sorry very high pH
504620	509900	conditions, very low hydroxyl, very high hydroxyl amounts and on the outside you've got the
509900	515300	protons from the protonic ocean or the carbonic ocean and so we've got a kind of entropy
515300	521280	trap here because we've got order, continual order between the inside and the outside.
521280	525460	This is reduced and this is somewhat oxidized on the outside and as I say it's a rather
525460	532100	like bacterium except that bacterium transports the protons out of the cell to come back in
532100	538260	to drive things like ATP whereas we don't need to drive that system because it's out
538260	539860	here as part of the initial condition.
539860	545460	So the initial conditions we would say favor metabolism right from the start.
545460	548940	So here we have it again from Schrodinger order, from order.
548940	555780	You can't have, you don't want a hypercyclic, you don't want to drag life out of a chaotic
555780	560500	mess, you need to have direct delivery and there's one thing that if you're not a geologist
560500	565620	or don't know any geology, the one thing I'd like to remember as a rock type and that is
566260	571380	sub-pentanization and so this is sub-pentanide and you're going to see a few slides of this,
571380	576140	you've all seen it in shop windows and so forth on the sides of shop windows.
576140	580580	You can see how fractured it is, this is a kind of little engines of generation of hydrogen
580580	586740	actually as the water permeates through this rock and sub-pentanizes what is the crust and
586740	591820	this is why in a kind of analogy with Maxwell's demon, this is the demon that makes the difference
591860	597340	between this fluid, sorry, this fluid and this fluid, the sub-pentanization reaction.
597340	605580	So just to remind us that this is the United Nations building, by the way JPL said I really
605580	607540	shouldn't show this side because it was political.
607540	612060	Well I mean here's the president so I think it's beyond politics but anyway here's our
612060	618180	sub-pentanide it's as you, I'm sure you've become aware of this rock type and what we're
618220	623100	looking at is something called olivine plus water, basically here's olivine, magnesium
623100	629660	iron silicate plus water, generate some silica, some magnetite so we've oxidized the iron
629660	635860	now, magnesium and calcium go into solution to give you the hydroxyl, the alkaline fluid
635860	639060	and hydrogen in solution.
639060	643940	And if there's carbon dioxide, some a little bit of methane and this is the pathway, the
643940	649420	geochemical pathway, it goes from CO2, basically it goes pretty fast to methane, or fairly
649420	654900	fast to methane, although you can see some of them, you can get formate in the reactions
654900	659460	so you can find this in a hot spring, typically hot spring, nothing to do with life at all,
659460	664060	will generate methane and you'll have a little bit of formate, you don't see any methyl alcohol
664060	670620	that seems to be pretty unstable and go to the methane.
671540	675420	We've talked about the methane and I've just said that I don't think that this was an early
675420	679740	reaction for biology, but nevertheless it's kind of there in the wings, the reaction that
679740	686180	really takes place I think is the hydrogen plus the CO2 to acetate, so basically acetate,
686180	691980	it's CO2 plus CH4 by the way, makes you acetate, so here's, to me this is the key reaction
691980	698900	and in our lab we can never make this, we've never been able to make this chemically, so
699060	704340	we think that this really was the job for life and so that thereby hangs the tale that
704340	709740	we think that life, the beginnings of life was something that was a kind of microbe
709740	714340	that was an acetogen, something that generated acetate from carbon, oxide and hydrogen.
714340	718220	So we heard about the black smokers this morning, here they are and of course when, as soon
718220	722260	as they were discovered, they were predicted by somebody by Jack Corliss and John Edmund
722260	728260	were with Jack Corliss when these were discovered, predicted by the way in the Pacific at 360
728500	732020	degrees centigrade, of course the first thing to come to their mind was well maybe life
732020	736180	started here, Stanley Miller didn't like that and wrote a letter to Nature saying it was
736180	740740	ludicrous to think life could start at 400 or 360 degrees centigrade, I mean yeah I agree
740740	745300	with them, but interestingly there wouldn't have been black smokers on the early earth,
745300	749740	there'd been many more of these springs but they would have been 400 degrees centigrade
749740	753380	but they wouldn't be black smoke because the only reason why you've got black smoke here
753380	757860	is because it's acidic, hot solution, it's not because it's cooling, it's because it's
757860	761380	interacting with the alkaline seawater so you get the precipitation of this kind of
761380	767740	so-called black smoke which are things like iron, zinc, manganese, oxides and nickel and
767740	773300	a little bit of cobalt, so this basically they provide the trace elements into the early
773300	778380	ocean and that becomes a reservoir, perhaps a super saturated reservoir of just the kind
778380	783740	of metals we require for the first enzymes.
783740	787660	So we've seen this, so this I'm not sure if you can get this, this is the ocean floor
787660	793700	spreading, here's the actual spreading axis here and right here we've got the magma, here's
793700	798060	the magma chamber so the water comes down to just about its critical point, perhaps a little
798060	802700	bit higher, becomes very buoyant, shoots back up and as I think Jennifer said you know
802700	808540	they only last for about 10 to 100 years so that's not very long and let's say they're
808620	814260	up to 400 degrees centigrade, so it can't be here but we've been working in mineral
814260	821260	deposits in Ireland and Alpine ultromethic provinces as called so we assume that there
823860	830220	should be other kinds of hot springs on the early earth and we predicted in 1989 that
830220	835540	there should be alkaline springs and Fortune would have it, a PhD student was looking out
835540	839620	of the submarine window as they were going to the mid-oceanic ridge, the mid-atlantic
839620	846620	ridge and she saw that some kind of little wisps of white smoke material and she stopped
848860	852260	the submarine, told Deb Callie and they went back and they found this extraordinary structure,
852260	857620	it's still the only main one to be found so far but it's the Lost City submarine spring,
857620	863180	it lasts for at least 30,000 years, pretty certainly 100,000 years so that's a 10 to
863220	868220	the 17 microseconds and somebody also said yesterday or perhaps this morning that the
868220	872380	interactions, the chemical interactions, we shouldn't think in our terms of us, our
872380	877220	big bulky selves in our time, we should think in terms of how long it takes to make these
877220	882060	chemical reactions so 10 to the power of 17 microseconds I would think is plenty of time
882060	888260	for life to start. So what we got here, so we've got this made of calcium and magnesium
888260	894940	hydroxide, it's up to 94 degrees centigrade, not too hot, 15 millimoles of hydrogen so
894940	901940	that's plenty of fuel, up to 2 millimoles of methane and they make compartments so
902940	908100	in the precipitation there's always, always these springs, whatever the kind, always generates
908100	914700	some hollow compartments where the fluid makes its way through in a kind of labyrinthine manner
914780	918300	and some of them seal off and so forth and I think these compartments are all important
918300	923460	because we must have compartments I think for metabolism to make any sense, not only
923460	929340	to keep the goodies so to speak inside but also to use those gradients which are pH gradients,
929340	936340	redox gradients and of course even a temperature gradient. So here's, this is geochemistry
936900	942740	and one thing to say about it is if it was geochemically easy to make, to reduce carbon
942740	949220	dioxide to methane, there would be no life, no requirement for it, it's a very fact that
949220	956220	it's such an uphill task to add an electron to CO2 and then reduce it to formate and formaldehyde
956740	962020	and then once you've got there, downhill it goes but because of this life can come in
962020	967860	here as the catalyst to bring us up to formate or formaldehyde and then downhill, it's like,
967860	974860	it's a kind of geochemical siphon. So, and here's what the methalogens do, so they make
975500	982100	it easier, catalysis lowers the activation energy required for the reaction and also
982100	989180	an ionic gradient is required to help CO2 be reduced to formate and then after that
989180	994260	it's fairly well downhill but it's very complicated to get energy out of this so I don't think
994260	1000060	that this was, the methalogens were not eaten early but we think the acetogens were. So
1000060	1005180	the acetogens now, they don't need an ionic gradient so much, well except in a sense
1005180	1010860	they need ATP or adenosine triphosphate and it's adenosine triphosphate that drives the
1010860	1016500	CO2 up to formate and formaldehyde and methylene and then downhill and then you add a methyl
1016500	1022500	group to carbon monoxide which is reduced elsewhere and you end up with acetate which
1022580	1027580	of course can take you on a pyruvate and eventually can aminate by the way all these reactions
1027580	1034580	taking place most easily in alkaline solution. So here, you put it all together and let's
1034580	1038660	think of this, you can think of this in all kinds of ways, it's the fractionation column,
1038660	1043740	it's a hydrothermal flow reactor and so, but what I've done is kind of dress it up as one
1043740	1048780	structure here but let me just remind you that here's, here are the reduced molecules
1048780	1053740	coming out, there's hydrogen of course, a little bit of methane, some ammonia, molybdenum
1053740	1058660	sulfide, soluble in alkaline solution as in, as our tungsten oxide which I think is pretty
1058660	1064260	significant because we, all life seems to require this molybdenum and tungsten at this
1064260	1070980	early stage of reduction and what I've plotted here really is basically the acetyl coenzyme
1070980	1076700	A pathway. So the CO2 comes from the outside, we think that we need some ferric ion or maybe
1076700	1084140	nitrate out here to help to oxidize the reduced molybdenum site so you lose an electron from
1084140	1088140	molybdenum from molybdenum 4 to molybdenum 5 and then you've got a very energetic electron
1088140	1093380	which can then reduce the CO2 and once you've done that then you're off on the, on that
1093380	1102300	pathway up through onto a cobalt enzyme which will take the methyl group onto acetyl coenzyme
1102300	1106260	synthase itself which is a nickel bearing enzyme, notice the importance of metals in
1106260	1113820	here, we've already required molybdenum, iron, of course iron sulfides as well and the cobalt
1113820	1120860	and the nickel and once we've got here then that the acetate can be taken either by what
1120860	1128500	is now the synthase, the thiol group and the thiol can then be phosphorylated to, to generate
1129060	1135420	acetyl phosphate and the phosphate can then with the help of other phosphate from outside
1135420	1146020	be, help to generate pyrophosphate from monophosphate so this in the acetyl coenzyme pathway is
1146020	1154580	ADP to ATP, here we're using just monophosphate or orthophosphate to go to pyrophosphate
1154660	1163380	and that then feeds into general biosynthesis, acetogenic biosynthesis, I should say that
1163380	1167940	there's also a methyl group here and I think that methanotrophy was probably early as well
1167940	1174740	and what was the oxidant for methanotrophy, probably nitric oxide on nitrate, so we've
1174740	1179180	got two different kinds of schemes here, one basically doing the main job for the world
1179180	1185100	and that's spending the hydrogen fuel and a little bit on the side spending the methyl
1185100	1190900	fuel, so what do we do with this, well we can take it into the lab and we can put a hydrothermal
1190900	1196020	solution on one side and ocean water on the other and we can mix them, we can heat them
1196020	1202500	up to 100 degrees centigrade, we can put them into a central reactor here with ultramafic
1202500	1206820	rock just like what's in the crust of the earth or the crust of Mars indeed or what
1206860	1211660	was Venus, all the same rock with a little bit of sulfide and out comes the fluid, we
1211660	1215780	then take this fluid and we take it to another lab and this is in the other lab and we inject
1215780	1220100	this fluid into what we think of as a Hadean ocean which we had a little bit of ferrous
1220100	1225180	chloride in up to perhaps 10 millimoles from those very hot springs, this kind of somewhat
1225180	1231580	acidic ocean and we get this immediate precipitation, oftentimes sulfide, a little bit of silica
1231780	1236860	and so on and what we, in that reactor we find we can make methane within actually just
1236860	1241860	about 10 hours, we've got 16 parts per million by volume, so this is an eight biotic reaction,
1241860	1246700	very easy to do and I think early life couldn't compete with geochemistry in this case. The
1246700	1251260	hydrogen sulfide goes up to about 14 millimoles and then down to about 1 to 2 millimoles but
1251260	1256980	again enough to precipitate such a membrane, here just to remind us is the sub-pentanization,
1256980	1262380	the requirement of sub-pentanization. So what do they look like? So we can now say
1262380	1268740	here's our main model, we're getting used to this now, now we know that we've got an
1268740	1273540	actual mound, a hydrothermal mound that's got compartments in it, here are the kind
1273540	1277220	of compartments, this is a chimney, within the chimney you get these small compartments
1277220	1282780	made of iron sulfide or ferrous hydroxide or oxyhydroxide with plenty of what looks
1282780	1288820	like catalytic surface to my mind anyway. So this is now the sequence and what we've
1288820	1293020	got here also is a propensity for waste, we can dispose of the waste, the things that
1293020	1299900	do not play, the molecules that do not interact can just be taken off as waste and of course
1299900	1305060	just like life itself, this is an entropy generator but ordering, there is ordering
1305060	1311460	going on within these structures but outside then entropy is generated through the waste,
1311460	1316580	polythermal, polychemical. So putting the whole thing together again, making it slightly
1316580	1323020	more reasonable to look at, here's our hydrothermal mound, submarine hydrothermal mound, it's being
1323020	1328620	fed with hydrogen sulfide, hydrogen ammonia, milliptin and tungsten, up to 120 degrees
1328620	1333620	centigrade pH 11 coming into this somewhat acidic ocean with all these electron acceptors
1333620	1339380	on the outside and the metals and phosphate and precipitating structures that are rather
1339420	1345260	similar, mineral structures that are rather similar to the active centers of enzymes and
1345260	1351060	just to emphasize this point one more time, here's the protons on the outside and we speculate
1351060	1360060	that the protons can basically drive monophosphate, phosphorylation to diphosphate or perhaps
1360060	1365020	through acetyl phosphate. So here's our proton motive force, it's all there, everything
1365260	1371660	you require for early life is there, all the metals, all the energy. So what I want to
1371660	1376780	emphasize is that biochemistry isn't just better geochemistry, there really is a discontinuity
1376780	1382140	and that discontinuity because people have been very unsuccessful in generating I think
1382140	1387900	organic molecules because they think that all you have to do is get the recipe right,
1387900	1391780	the chemical recipe and we'll get life. I don't think so, we've got to have that proton
1391820	1400820	motive force and redox gradients. So we can go to Gunter Vectors Heuser and Claudia Huber
1400820	1406580	for perhaps one of the first interesting structures. Now this isn't so good as it looks I admit
1406580	1411940	but what he's taken is a methyl group and a carbon monoxide and shown that on nickel ion
1411940	1420940	sulfide and indeed even nickel sulfate or nickel sulfide then he can make acetyl thioacidate
1420940	1426940	basically and hydrogen sulfide. He's done this at pH 6.4 which is very nice little spike here,
1426940	1430940	we haven't been able to reproduce that but that could be our failing but you could see that
1430940	1436620	actually it's very well satisfied this kind of reaction at pretty high pH. So again I want
1436620	1442700	to emphasize just how many of these reactions are promoted by alkaline conditions. So we take
1442700	1448700	a closer look at our membranes, our structures made in the lab and there are some peculiarities
1448700	1453820	to it and of course anybody's got any ideas about this I'd welcome them but here this is the kind
1453820	1457660	of membrane so we're inside the membrane here this is and you can see these love what are called
1457660	1464220	framboids it's kind of raspberry shaped ion sulfides that grow on the inside then here we've
1464220	1469820	got a mixture of ion monosulfide and something called Gregite Fe3S4 and on the outside is what
1469820	1476460	the outside looks like absolutely extraordinary ordering of the outside and indeed even the
1476460	1481500	inside looks like this and we thought that might be kind of claddeny plate material we're just not
1481500	1486140	I don't know why these make such beautiful structures I mean they're much more beautiful
1486780	1493820	and reliable and then waves on a beach in sand and we would say that most of the action takes
1493820	1498620	place here the alkaline flow goes out the acidic counter flow comes in and most of the
1499660	1505180	organic interactions or organic synthesis we would argue would be happening actually within
1505180	1511580	the membrane this membrane's about five to ten microns across pretty wide for a membrane and it's
1511580	1516940	inorganic so if we look again at this what what are the structures of the elements or the the
1516940	1521420	minerals that make make this well look the main mineral to precipitate is something called mechanawad
1521420	1526460	and it's made here it is an ion sulfa ion sulfur rom basically you put this together in such a way
1526460	1532220	that it makes for something that's actually a pretty good electron conductor in that direction
1532300	1537820	and a very good insulator in this direction it's it's uh so we've got a semi permeable and a
1537820	1542060	semi conducting membrane so this is one of the chimneys here's here's a chimney again and this
1542060	1546940	is kind of a little offshoot little compartment here and here are subcompoundments within the
1546940	1554140	membrane itself now if you look at that mechanawad how similar it is to the actual active center of
1554140	1559020	hydrogenase and one thing we need to do is if you've got H2 you've got to split into two electrons
1559020	1564540	and two protons so and this is what hydrogenase does and here here's a structure ion sulfur ion
1564540	1570860	sulfur so similar of course to this structure here so could it be that this was the first
1571900	1577660	hydrogenase it doesn't not a very effective one but effective enough and not only that could it be
1577660	1583020	that it's ready for co-option so that if it were to be co-opted by a short peptide maybe that would
1583020	1591820	make it even slightly more active so we if you have this at 80 degrees centigrade this hydrothermal
1591820	1596540	chimney then within about two or three days sometimes sooner you get the generation of
1596540	1603100	something called gregite which is fv well it should be fv5 ni s8 oftentimes there's not nickel
1603100	1608540	there sometimes there is if the nickel is there and it's going to be in this tetrahedral side here
1608540	1613020	so here we've got now we've put the two roms together so we've got ion sulfur ion sulfur and
1613020	1617980	behind it ion sulfur ion sulfur through two sulfas to nickel so and this is just slightly
1617980	1622540	oxidized and it's the ion that's oxidized not the sulfur so this is nothing to do with the
1622540	1627180	pyrite hypothesis because that's the pyrite hypothesis it's a sulfur that gets oxidized but
1627180	1631900	of course with it's much better i think if we have the ion going back from shall we say
1632620	1640380	2 plus to 2.5 plus on average again here's the what the membrane looks like this made of this material
1642220	1646860	and look how similar it is to acetylcoenzyme synthase which is kind of where we came in here's
1646860	1652780	the nickel side through sulfur and here's now we've got a box or a cubane structure which is
1652780	1657980	extraordinarily similar to the cubane structure in here so again we're wondering can this be
1657980	1665500	the kind of structure that is actually acting as acetylcoenzyme synthase type in the in the
1665500	1672220	vectus hyzer huba reaction so here we have those that kind of structure so what's next well of
1672220	1677260	course what we need next because what's easy to make with and and as everybody's agreed RNA is
1677260	1683260	hard to make almost impossible to make but but amino acids are easy to make in the lab so we would
1683260	1690700	say that that's first and here again huba and vectus hyzer has made some amino acids in the lab
1690700	1699100	and not only that they can amenate them and in this case they've amenated these various structures
1700300	1704220	with either iron sulfide or ferrous hydroxide so that's the kind of thing that should be able to
1704220	1711180	happen in our chimneys and they happen at pH 9 and the yield is extraordinary
1713340	1719900	well if we can do that can can we if we if pyrophosphates available and and I should say that
1719900	1725660	diswort and and Andy Pratt have produced pyrophosphate in the lab in a kind of substrate
1725660	1731900	phosphorylation technique using ferrous iron as the catalyst and iron sulfide and and using that
1732940	1736540	then yamanaka et al and others have managed to
1737100	1744860	uh actually phosphoryte and then uh basically dimerize uh with trimetaphosphate in this case
1744860	1751260	glycine to two glycines and that's pretty not a bad yield uh at about pH again right about pH 9
1751260	1757660	if you lower the pH uh then after after 20 days or so you can get up to glycine 4 or glycine 6 now
1757660	1764380	once you've got the glycine 6 that's getting quite useful anything before five four and six
1764380	1771020	becomes useful and one possible function for these is that they could then through uh then the amine
1771020	1777580	group uh directly bond to the delta negative on on the amine group things like cobalt and nickel
1777580	1784780	and could these be very inefficient but basically kind of pigment peptides and could they do we
1784780	1789980	know these structures exist uh they've never been shown to be active uh because I think they've never
1789980	1795420	been tested in this way but could these be for example similar to a transfer site for acetal
1795420	1802300	coenzyme synthase and uh and the site for reduction of the methyl group to to methane so we've got
1802300	1808300	structures again that everything as I say is kind of on the plate here uh so could we then have a
1808300	1814220	beginning of a peptide takeover now nobody's shown this this is just paper chemistry as people
1814220	1820860	would like to point out but here we'd suggest it could nevertheless ferredoxins are the uh according
1820860	1827180	to Ecken Dayhoff in a wonderful paper in science in 1966 uh have the longest of all pedigrees of all
1827180	1833180	metal proteins uh could it be the very first one was actually structured in a loop uh through
1833180	1839260	hydrogen bonding through to that to a thylated ion sulfide so here's here's our cubane structure
1839260	1846140	and here's the possibility of uh it's actually being thylated sorry uh hydrogen bonded to the
1846140	1851740	backbone it notice it doesn't matter what the side chains are just the backbone of a short peptide
1851740	1856460	now of course these days it's and probably fairly early on it's cysteines but cysteine is hard to
1856460	1861420	make in the lab it may be there were no sulfur bearing amino acid side chains right at the
1861420	1867100	beginning but you will notice if you people who worked on ferredoxins the ion sulfide is always
1867100	1875660	in a loop so we'd say then uh working with uh Wolfgang Nitschke uh he's he's suggested and for
1876380	1881020	various reasons including phylogenetics that the last universal common ancestor which we
1881020	1887820	would put further back uh but nevertheless uh we'd say that the last universal common ancestor
1887820	1893820	must have had millibitim di-terrin enzymes had nitric oxide, ridottes, nickel ion, hydrogenase
1893820	1899100	and acetylcoenzyme synthase and carbon monoxide dehydrogenase which you have to have metals for
1899100	1903660	this and we'd suggest the metals were right in there right at the beginning uh and eventually
1903660	1911740	were co-opted so that all sounds part of that is airy fairy maybe but the earlier part I think uh
1911740	1917660	it holds up well and now we've got the possibility that we've got a phosphate uh and we know we can
1917660	1923100	see phosphate and pyrophosphate in these situations and that really would interact with the with the
1923100	1929180	sidechain uh sorry the backbone of uh of short peptide to make a little peptide nest and and
1929180	1936780	James Milner White and I call this a phosphate egg in in a in a peptide nest and this looks I think
1936780	1942780	you'll agree very much like the P loop so here's the here's how we would dress that up but as a
1942780	1951900	slightly longer peptide and we turn this in taking our cue from Enric and Margareta Balczewski we take
1951900	1958300	the idea that perhaps uh they've the first kind of pyrophosphatase was a proton pyrophosphatase
1958300	1963500	and that we could drive the generation of orthophosphate from pyrophosphate from
1964460	1972860	orthophosphate by protons coming through the membrane and having a magnesium ion as the catalyst
1972860	1977980	of course to because of the repulsion between the phosphates this is required but also this is a
1977980	1983420	little kind of entropy uh to our mind kind of entropy catalyst as well holding things in because
1983420	1988860	of the hydrogen bonding from the back of it from the amine group through to the oxygens on the
1988860	1995180	phosphate so this would say perhaps this is what the early proton pyrophosphatase actually looked
1995180	2001980	like and perhaps it was uh fired up basically by protons coming through the membrane from the acidic
2001980	2007660	ocean so here we have the kind of rough equation for this magnesium phosphate plus the plus orthophosphate
2007660	2016060	plus the proton to give us your magnesium diphosphate if we've got these short peptides what we've
2016060	2022540	done here is to put four or five peptides actually in the hydrothermal solution the alkaline hydrothermal
2022540	2029180	solution and when we do that we make even more better ordered structures and these structures are
2029740	2034140	as you see just beautifully ribbed both inside and outside and glycine apparently gives us the
2034140	2041180	best structure of all for reasons we don't understand so then we go back then to think
2041180	2046940	where we've been with us and what we've done is to say take up an idea well a paper from Andrew's
2046940	2053820	et al who could show that you could get mixed acid fermentation via formate hydrogen hydrogen liase
2053900	2059500	and the reaction generates hydrogen and co2 from formate and protons and actually
2059500	2064540	generates a proton motive force and it what is required here is uh one of these molybdenum
2064540	2071020	enzymes and an iron iron sulfide factor as well and the nickel iron uh as well uh so what we've
2071020	2075260	thought of and of course this is something we're trying to do in the lab uh is perhaps we could
2075260	2081100	reduce it perhaps we can turn this around make the protons come inside using nickel iron sulfide
2081100	2086940	and molybdenum as the as a catalyst and see if we can generate formate and and perhaps formaldehyde
2087740	2095100	from the inside by reacting co2 and the protons and electrons to make the formate at pH 10 or pH
2095100	2101660	9 or pH 10 so this becomes uh really uh holy grail that's one question we'd like to answer
2103180	2107740	so what else does this kind of uh structure offer well we're not we don't know anything
2108700	2115980	in detail about the RNA well but uh cunin and uh using cunin and cunin and martin and
2115980	2122140	basket al have suggested that in fact if you've got structures like this then maybe the first RNAs
2122140	2130220	wherever they come from act like viruses uh and uh basically can permeate through and start to make
2130940	2136620	uh better replicators as we go through this the structure and but also if you were to make
2137340	2143260	DNA in this in this series in in this way you could have a polymerase chain reaction which
2143260	2148300	is run thermally or convectively because it's going to be cool on the outside and hot in the inside
2148300	2154380	so you're going to have a convective polymerase chain reaction to build up shall we say uh DNA
2154380	2162780	lengths and then thermophoresis or thermo uh thermal diffusion then tends to drive uh concentrated
2163900	2172540	molecules that are that are ionic into basically into the coolest area of one of these compartments
2172540	2178300	so so again we haven't just got the geotherm we haven't just got the redox gradient and the
2178300	2183340	the pH gradient we've also got a thermal gradient that may help right at the beginning as you start
2183340	2191340	to gain uh replication so this is the way then we would see the very emergence of life probably
2191340	2198220	between 50 70 degrees centigrade 40 to 80 maybe uh hydrogen and methane as the fuels
2198220	2204220	molybdenum tungsten absolutely required as catalysts along with iron iron nickel sulfides
2205340	2211180	and perhaps the the first actual microbe which we would assume was a bacterium
2212140	2216780	emanating from the spring not into the ocean by the way but down into the deep biosphere
2217580	2221340	because i think it's basically a desert in the ocean and it's a dangerous desert as we've seen
2222380	2228460	but these first this first uh microbes would be generating acetate or acetic acid and then
2228460	2235180	there'd be some more minor reactions that would generate uh using nitric oxide as the electron
2235260	2242620	acceptor uh carbon dioxide and nitrogen and water from this reaction uh and this would become to
2242620	2249980	our minds the methanotroph the methanotrophic archaea so if we put all that together and we've
2249980	2256780	heard other uh suggestions uh for example this morning about the big bang a big bang when i
2256780	2262460	go to parties people ask me what i do and i you know i i kind of finally cough if they really seem
2262460	2267100	to be interested and i tell them i'm working on the origin alive i see them six months later
2267100	2271260	and they always seem to say oh you're the guy working on the big bang and it kind of pushed
2271260	2276860	us in to this idea that you know we make the comparison and uh with shaw and carol on hand
2277820	2283020	he wrote this lovely book called from attorney to here which the older people in the audience
2283020	2287980	will understand there's a pretty good title and if he starts with a big bang and uh it's a very high
2288780	2294540	enthalpy low entropy big bang and here we are now and we do the same thing we'd have a big bang
2294540	2299900	we go from geochemistry to biochemistry but we can't just segue one from the other you you've
2299900	2304460	got to go through this discontinuity and what helps us through the discontinuity we would say
2304460	2310620	is the the proton motive force and chemiosmosis which are on tap in in the situation and then
2310620	2316140	after that uh we get this various evolutions parts of evolution part of which has been covered by
2316140	2322860	others of course this is huge yawning gap between metabolism and uh and replication and and we don't
2322860	2327500	deny that one thing i would say though and and that is that nearly everybody that's been talking
2327500	2333820	about RNA and DNA and uh enzymes are on the other side of a canyon for me i admit that but we can
2333820	2337980	see each other from either side we're not that down there or up there we've got there is a lot
2337980	2343420	in common between mineralogy and geochemistry and the very fact of the initial conditions
2343420	2350700	that uh i think will eventually allow us to converge uh and just to emphasize that you know
2350700	2356540	we've got 10 to the power of 17 microseconds and i really do think that's enough time for
2356540	2363820	life to emerge imagine what 200 postdocs could do for you in that amount of time uh 24 7 of
2363820	2375260	course 365 as usual that's it thank you very much
