00:00.000 --> 00:03.720
Mark Rober has quickly become one of my favorite YouTubers.

00:03.720 --> 00:08.160
His content is both entertaining and educational, so when I procrastinate and watch his videos,

00:08.160 --> 00:11.000
I can at least say to myself that I'm learning something new.

00:11.000 --> 00:13.000
3, 2, 1...

00:13.000 --> 00:24.100
However, what I find most fascinating about him is his growth here on YouTube.

00:24.100 --> 00:28.480
He averages a ridiculous 27 million views per video, and even when he's not uploading,

00:28.480 --> 00:30.920
he still has a consistent stream of viewers coming in.

00:30.920 --> 00:36.160
I mean, in the last 30 days, he hasn't uploaded a single video, but he has brought in 36 million

00:36.160 --> 00:37.160
views.

00:37.160 --> 00:40.640
That's in the region of $100,000 in ad revenue.

00:40.640 --> 00:44.960
How can one guy who uploads just 12 videos a year be growing so fast and dominating our

00:44.960 --> 00:46.820
recommended feeds?

00:46.820 --> 00:50.080
Maybe Mark Rober knows something that we don't about YouTube.

00:50.080 --> 00:53.400
In this video, we're going to break down how he is beating the algorithm to reach new

00:53.400 --> 00:55.120
people every day.

00:55.120 --> 00:58.520
If you're a smaller creator who wants to grow your own channel, get out your notebook

00:58.520 --> 01:02.680
and get ready for a Mark Rober YouTube Masterclass.

01:02.680 --> 01:06.200
On this channel, I like to analyze the biggest and fastest growing YouTubers and get to the

01:06.200 --> 01:08.240
bottom of how they have built their audiences.

01:08.240 --> 01:12.600
Now, if you were to ask Mark himself about the secret to his success, he would probably

01:12.600 --> 01:15.440
give you a very humble answer like this.

01:15.440 --> 01:18.360
Your videos get 27 million views on average.

01:18.360 --> 01:19.360
Is this true?

01:19.360 --> 01:20.360
This is true.

01:20.360 --> 01:22.760
It's actually the most on all of YouTube.

01:22.760 --> 01:23.760
What is the secret?

01:23.760 --> 01:26.240
I do like wholesome stuff.

01:26.240 --> 01:30.440
I like doing things that are big and crazy in a world's largest Nerf gun, world's largest

01:30.440 --> 01:31.440
Super Soaker.

01:31.440 --> 01:33.120
But let's be real for a minute.

01:33.120 --> 01:36.040
Top YouTubers understand how the algorithm works.

01:36.040 --> 01:39.440
They know what sort of content to make and what tactics to use to bring in millions of

01:39.440 --> 01:40.440
views.

01:40.440 --> 01:44.280
Do you think a guy who helps put a robot on Mars just makes wholesome content and hopes

01:44.280 --> 01:45.360
for the best?

01:45.360 --> 01:47.320
We know you're smarter than that, Mark.

01:47.320 --> 01:50.760
Through my research, I've broken down the three steps Mark Rober uses with every video

01:50.760 --> 01:53.160
to give it the best chance of going viral.

01:53.160 --> 01:56.080
And I don't even want to hype this up too much, but some of the things that he is doing

01:56.080 --> 01:59.920
will make you realise just how much thought goes into every upload.

01:59.920 --> 02:03.360
The best part is these are steps that anyone can learn from to make better videos and get

02:03.360 --> 02:04.360
more views.

02:04.360 --> 02:08.720
Let's get straight into things.

02:08.720 --> 02:14.920
So, now what?

02:14.920 --> 02:18.480
I'm using the phrase beating the algorithm, but really when it comes to what Mark Rober

02:18.480 --> 02:22.440
is doing, it's about giving the algorithm exactly what it wants.

02:22.440 --> 02:25.880
Mark Rober uses their algorithm to help surface videos that people will click on and watch

02:25.880 --> 02:29.760
because at the end of the day, they want people to stay on their site.

02:29.760 --> 02:32.720
Using this graph, we can understand how content goes viral.

02:32.720 --> 02:34.960
Let's take this video here as an example.

02:34.960 --> 02:37.640
When it was first uploaded, it was shown to a certain number of people.

02:37.640 --> 02:40.960
Let's call this group of people the early audience.

02:40.960 --> 02:43.920
These are viewers who have recently watched Mark's videos before and a high percentage

02:43.920 --> 02:45.920
will be subscribers.

02:45.920 --> 02:50.280
If the video performs well in the data here, it will be shown to more of this group.

02:50.280 --> 02:54.400
The viral moment comes when YouTube starts to show this video to a wider audience and

02:54.400 --> 02:57.100
it still performs really well.

02:57.100 --> 03:01.640
This tells YouTube that the video appears to a lot of people, not only fans of Mark Rober,

03:01.640 --> 03:05.720
so they start to recommend it to more and more people who they feel will enjoy the content.

03:05.720 --> 03:08.700
This is often called the algorithm picking up a video.

03:08.700 --> 03:12.360
It keeps being recommended until it eventually begins to plateau and decline.

03:12.360 --> 03:16.320
Now, obviously a YouTuber like Mark Rober has the head start of having a big subscriber

03:16.320 --> 03:20.640
base, but it's pretty much the same idea no matter how small the channel is.

03:20.640 --> 03:24.320
The important question is how do YouTube decide if a video is performing well?

03:24.320 --> 03:26.480
What data do they actually look at?

03:26.480 --> 03:29.440
And if you've watched this channel before, you already know what I'm going to say are

03:29.440 --> 03:31.560
the three most important metrics.

03:31.560 --> 03:34.480
Click through it, watch time and audience retention.

03:34.480 --> 03:37.640
When it comes to viral videos, this is the Holy Trinity and you can bet your ass that

03:37.640 --> 03:40.760
Mark Rober is dominating these metrics.

03:40.760 --> 03:44.880
It varies a lot, but if you can get over 4 minutes of watch time with a 50% or above

03:44.880 --> 03:51.240
audience retention and a 10-20% CTR, you have a really good chance of going viral.

03:51.240 --> 03:55.680
The last time I hit those figures myself, this happened.

03:55.680 --> 04:00.800
So what is Mark doing to make sure that every video he makes smashes each of these metrics?

04:00.800 --> 04:05.080
Now obviously making videos on fascinating ideas and having a big budget helps, but lots

04:05.080 --> 04:08.880
of people try and copy this and never see a fraction of the results.

04:08.880 --> 04:13.720
Let's first look at step one, how he structures his videos using retention tactics.

04:13.720 --> 04:17.400
Has anyone ever noticed that when you click on a Mark Rober video, 10 minutes goes by

04:17.400 --> 04:19.720
in the blink of an eye?

04:19.720 --> 04:23.240
You might just think it's because he makes awesome videos, which is true, but he also

04:23.240 --> 04:26.680
uses techniques which makes it so hard for you to click off.

04:26.680 --> 04:30.240
There's actually a science to making someone feel fully immersed in your video.

04:30.240 --> 04:34.160
Let's investigate the tactics Mark is using to keep you watching.

04:34.160 --> 04:37.520
At the start of all Mark's videos, he gives you a hook, context and setup.

04:37.520 --> 04:41.840
I like to look at this as the what, why and how section of a video.

04:41.840 --> 04:45.720
Mark explains very quickly what the video is about, gives context to why he is doing

04:45.720 --> 04:48.080
it and then tells you how it's going to go down.

04:48.080 --> 04:51.120
This means that the viewer has a clear understanding of what they are going to experience with

04:51.120 --> 04:52.120
the video.

04:52.120 --> 04:54.200
Let's look at this in action.

04:54.200 --> 04:59.040
This is a bird feeder and everything to my left is my attempt at making a squirrel proof.

04:59.040 --> 05:02.720
If they want the bird seed, they will first need to pass through what is basically an

05:02.720 --> 05:05.480
8 part ninja warrior obstacle course for squirrels.

05:05.480 --> 05:10.160
This course is extremely challenging, it is not for the timid of heart.

05:10.160 --> 05:14.360
But out of the gate, I will admit that in hindsight, that I completely underestimated

05:14.360 --> 05:15.360
my adversary.

05:15.360 --> 05:19.240
Now if you're wondering why I would go through all this trouble, we need to go back 8 weeks

05:19.240 --> 05:22.560
ago when I found myself stuck at home and very bored.

05:22.560 --> 05:25.040
Next is the fact that Mark's videos have great pacing.

05:25.040 --> 05:29.240
I genuinely think this is what separates good YouTubers from great YouTubers.

05:29.240 --> 05:33.520
You need to realise the attention span of a YouTube viewer is pretty low, no offence.

05:33.520 --> 05:36.360
So Mark overleaves no dull moments in his videos.

05:36.360 --> 05:39.920
For example he could have spent ages showing everyone how he built the obstacle course,

05:39.920 --> 05:42.720
but he instead made a really quick build montage.

05:42.720 --> 05:46.640
Many YouTubers would have just kept this part in, but do people really need to see it?

05:46.640 --> 05:51.800
We are here to see the squirrel version of Total Wipeout, not a carpentry lesson.

05:51.800 --> 05:54.160
And finally Mark makes us wait for the result.

05:54.160 --> 05:57.760
You need to carry people along for a reward at the end of the video.

05:57.760 --> 06:01.440
Which in Mark's case is seeing whether the squirrels beat his course or not.

06:01.440 --> 06:05.680
The magic is in pacing the video correctly, so the climax builds as you near the end,

06:05.680 --> 06:09.160
keeping people watching from the first second until the conclusion.

06:09.160 --> 06:13.360
Mark Rick was the first one to enter the course, so in the end, after about a week of effort,

06:13.360 --> 06:16.280
it was fitting he was the one to make it to the jackpot first.

06:16.280 --> 06:20.200
And he's so stoked, he apparently wants to run the whole course in reverse.

06:20.200 --> 06:23.760
In hindsight we probably should have made the jackpot a little quieter.

06:23.760 --> 06:27.760
So when Mark combines these retention tactics with a good video idea and storytelling, the

06:27.760 --> 06:31.000
viewer has no choice but to stick around and watch the video.

06:31.000 --> 06:35.440
The result is retention graphs that look like this, and let me tell you, YouTube loves nothing

06:35.440 --> 06:37.240
more than a straight retention curve.

06:37.440 --> 06:40.760
Alright, so that's how Mark makes people stay on his videos to give him great watch

06:40.760 --> 06:42.360
time and retention.

06:42.360 --> 06:45.560
But he of course needs people to actually click on them in the first place, which brings

06:45.560 --> 06:50.120
us on to step number two, Mark uses killer metadata.

06:50.120 --> 06:53.560
Metadata on YouTube is essentially everything you use to describe your video.

06:53.560 --> 06:57.240
The main four types are titles, thumbnails, tags and descriptions.

06:57.240 --> 07:01.520
Now a few years ago, your description and tags were very important, but in 2020 they're

07:01.520 --> 07:02.520
pretty irrelevant.

07:02.520 --> 07:06.440
I still like to fill them up with keywords and search terms, but using my YouTube tool

07:06.640 --> 07:11.800
buddy, I can see that neither Mark Rober or MrBeast used any tags in their last upload,

07:11.800 --> 07:14.320
and they both keep their descriptions pretty short.

07:14.320 --> 07:19.400
I think this is a good sign not to pay too much attention to them anymore, with one exception.

07:19.400 --> 07:23.320
Try using your first line in your video description as a teaser to your video, because this is

07:23.320 --> 07:25.560
displayed in search.

07:25.560 --> 07:28.760
So as for Mark's titles, there are a few things worth noting.

07:28.760 --> 07:31.200
First of all, they are often under 50 characters.

07:31.200 --> 07:35.640
This means that when viewed on mobile in your recommended feed, none of it is cut off.

07:35.640 --> 07:38.520
This also leads to his titles being super pragmatic.

07:38.520 --> 07:42.360
They're kind of hilariously casual, yet just testing if sharks can smell a drop of blood

07:42.360 --> 07:43.880
and nothing much.

07:43.880 --> 07:46.480
Being straight to the point gets rewarded on YouTube.

07:46.480 --> 07:50.160
If you confuse someone with your title, they're not going to click.

07:50.160 --> 07:52.520
But it's Mark's thumbnails that really make him stand out.

07:52.520 --> 07:55.960
Now from looking at them, you might think they look a little amateurish, but this is

07:55.960 --> 07:56.960
the point.

07:56.960 --> 07:59.800
I talked about this in my first MrBeast video.

07:59.800 --> 08:01.920
People love YouTube for the homemade feel of it.

08:01.920 --> 08:04.680
It's why we watch our favorite creators instead of TV.

08:04.680 --> 08:08.360
Such thumbnails with great graphic design might look more aesthetic, but that doesn't

08:08.360 --> 08:10.520
always mean it's better.

08:10.520 --> 08:14.120
Whenever Mark does use text, it's kept to four or less words, and the most important

08:14.120 --> 08:18.200
part of the thumbnail is always the demonstration of what is actually happening.

08:18.200 --> 08:21.840
Sometimes it's completely staged, such as this shark one, but he finds the balance between

08:21.840 --> 08:25.200
clickbait and then actually delivering on his promise.

08:25.200 --> 08:27.120
Thumbnails can make or break a YouTube video.

08:27.120 --> 08:30.840
For example, I first used this thumbnail with my David Dobrik video and it got 10K views

08:30.840 --> 08:31.840
in a week.

08:31.840 --> 08:34.640
It then changed it to this one and it blew up to 200K views.

08:34.640 --> 08:38.200
There's very little difference between them, but people just found this option much more

08:38.200 --> 08:39.440
interesting.

08:39.440 --> 08:44.280
One little change made me an extra $600 and brought in 1,900 subscribers.

08:44.280 --> 08:47.920
While Mark's thumbnails might look simple, I guarantee you he spends ages trying to get

08:47.920 --> 08:49.720
them just right.

08:49.720 --> 08:52.520
I recommend making multiple thumbnails and comparing them.

08:52.520 --> 08:55.440
If you are really trying to invest in your YouTube channel, you can use a tool like

08:55.440 --> 08:58.440
TubeBuddy, which has a feature called A-B Testing.

08:58.440 --> 09:01.820
You basically can load two different thumbnails into their software and they will rotate them

09:01.820 --> 09:05.480
automatically on your video and measure the CTR for each one.

09:05.480 --> 09:08.420
You can easily see which is best and go with that one.

09:08.420 --> 09:11.380
You can install this software using my link below.

09:11.380 --> 09:14.860
So this is how Mark Rober dominates the most important YouTube metrics.

09:14.860 --> 09:16.480
It all seems pretty simple, right?

09:16.480 --> 09:19.420
But the beauty is in executing it to perfection.

09:19.420 --> 09:22.100
Don't go anywhere just yet though because there is one more step he is taking that I

09:22.100 --> 09:24.520
think is so important to keep in mind.

09:24.520 --> 09:27.780
He gives his videos breathing room.

09:27.780 --> 09:31.020
Mark uploads just once per month, or even less at the moment.

09:31.020 --> 09:34.400
Though I have heard he's got a pretty cool video with DudePerfect coming soon, so watch

09:34.400 --> 09:35.400
out for that.

09:35.400 --> 09:39.700
You see, YouTube is no longer a place that rewards sheer quantity.

09:39.700 --> 09:43.960
Right now to stand out, you need to provide 10 times the quality you did 5 years ago.

09:43.960 --> 09:47.520
If Mark uploaded weekly videos, I'm sure they would be good, but if he takes all that

09:47.520 --> 09:52.740
effort and puts it into one video a month, it's going to be an insane video.

09:52.740 --> 09:56.720
From an algorithm perspective, creating banger video after banger video means each upload

09:56.720 --> 10:02.060
continues to ride the wave of success of the previous video, keeping his momentum alive.

10:02.060 --> 10:05.800
Now uploading less might seem like pretty terrible advice, and of course it varies channel

10:05.800 --> 10:06.800
to channel.

10:06.800 --> 10:10.960
But the truth is, right now you might have a quality problem and not a quantity problem.

10:10.960 --> 10:14.480
I really enjoyed making this video on Mark and I hope you learned as much from him as

10:14.480 --> 10:15.960
I did myself.

10:15.960 --> 10:18.880
Please smash the subscribe and turn the notifications on.

10:18.880 --> 10:22.960
99% of you aren't subscribed, which is definitely a record.

10:22.960 --> 10:26.320
Also give me a follow on Instagram, I post a lot of YouTube related content over there

10:26.400 --> 10:30.360
including how much I'm making on YouTube and what my analytics look like.

10:30.360 --> 10:31.960
For now though, I'll see you in the next one.
