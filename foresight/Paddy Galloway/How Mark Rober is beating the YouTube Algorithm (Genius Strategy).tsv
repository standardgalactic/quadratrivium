0	3720	Mark Rober has quickly become one of my favorite YouTubers.
3720	8160	His content is both entertaining and educational, so when I procrastinate and watch his videos,
8160	11000	I can at least say to myself that I'm learning something new.
11000	13000	3, 2, 1...
13000	24100	However, what I find most fascinating about him is his growth here on YouTube.
24100	28480	He averages a ridiculous 27 million views per video, and even when he's not uploading,
28480	30920	he still has a consistent stream of viewers coming in.
30920	36160	I mean, in the last 30 days, he hasn't uploaded a single video, but he has brought in 36 million
36160	37160	views.
37160	40640	That's in the region of $100,000 in ad revenue.
40640	44960	How can one guy who uploads just 12 videos a year be growing so fast and dominating our
44960	46820	recommended feeds?
46820	50080	Maybe Mark Rober knows something that we don't about YouTube.
50080	53400	In this video, we're going to break down how he is beating the algorithm to reach new
53400	55120	people every day.
55120	58520	If you're a smaller creator who wants to grow your own channel, get out your notebook
58520	62680	and get ready for a Mark Rober YouTube Masterclass.
62680	66200	On this channel, I like to analyze the biggest and fastest growing YouTubers and get to the
66200	68240	bottom of how they have built their audiences.
68240	72600	Now, if you were to ask Mark himself about the secret to his success, he would probably
72600	75440	give you a very humble answer like this.
75440	78360	Your videos get 27 million views on average.
78360	79360	Is this true?
79360	80360	This is true.
80360	82760	It's actually the most on all of YouTube.
82760	83760	What is the secret?
83760	86240	I do like wholesome stuff.
86240	90440	I like doing things that are big and crazy in a world's largest Nerf gun, world's largest
90440	91440	Super Soaker.
91440	93120	But let's be real for a minute.
93120	96040	Top YouTubers understand how the algorithm works.
96040	99440	They know what sort of content to make and what tactics to use to bring in millions of
99440	100440	views.
100440	104280	Do you think a guy who helps put a robot on Mars just makes wholesome content and hopes
104280	105360	for the best?
105360	107320	We know you're smarter than that, Mark.
107320	110760	Through my research, I've broken down the three steps Mark Rober uses with every video
110760	113160	to give it the best chance of going viral.
113160	116080	And I don't even want to hype this up too much, but some of the things that he is doing
116080	119920	will make you realise just how much thought goes into every upload.
119920	123360	The best part is these are steps that anyone can learn from to make better videos and get
123360	124360	more views.
124360	128720	Let's get straight into things.
128720	134920	So, now what?
134920	138480	I'm using the phrase beating the algorithm, but really when it comes to what Mark Rober
138480	142440	is doing, it's about giving the algorithm exactly what it wants.
142440	145880	Mark Rober uses their algorithm to help surface videos that people will click on and watch
145880	149760	because at the end of the day, they want people to stay on their site.
149760	152720	Using this graph, we can understand how content goes viral.
152720	154960	Let's take this video here as an example.
154960	157640	When it was first uploaded, it was shown to a certain number of people.
157640	160960	Let's call this group of people the early audience.
160960	163920	These are viewers who have recently watched Mark's videos before and a high percentage
163920	165920	will be subscribers.
165920	170280	If the video performs well in the data here, it will be shown to more of this group.
170280	174400	The viral moment comes when YouTube starts to show this video to a wider audience and
174400	177100	it still performs really well.
177100	181640	This tells YouTube that the video appears to a lot of people, not only fans of Mark Rober,
181640	185720	so they start to recommend it to more and more people who they feel will enjoy the content.
185720	188700	This is often called the algorithm picking up a video.
188700	192360	It keeps being recommended until it eventually begins to plateau and decline.
192360	196320	Now, obviously a YouTuber like Mark Rober has the head start of having a big subscriber
196320	200640	base, but it's pretty much the same idea no matter how small the channel is.
200640	204320	The important question is how do YouTube decide if a video is performing well?
204320	206480	What data do they actually look at?
206480	209440	And if you've watched this channel before, you already know what I'm going to say are
209440	211560	the three most important metrics.
211560	214480	Click through it, watch time and audience retention.
214480	217640	When it comes to viral videos, this is the Holy Trinity and you can bet your ass that
217640	220760	Mark Rober is dominating these metrics.
220760	224880	It varies a lot, but if you can get over 4 minutes of watch time with a 50% or above
224880	231240	audience retention and a 10-20% CTR, you have a really good chance of going viral.
231240	235680	The last time I hit those figures myself, this happened.
235680	240800	So what is Mark doing to make sure that every video he makes smashes each of these metrics?
240800	245080	Now obviously making videos on fascinating ideas and having a big budget helps, but lots
245080	248880	of people try and copy this and never see a fraction of the results.
248880	253720	Let's first look at step one, how he structures his videos using retention tactics.
253720	257400	Has anyone ever noticed that when you click on a Mark Rober video, 10 minutes goes by
257400	259720	in the blink of an eye?
259720	263240	You might just think it's because he makes awesome videos, which is true, but he also
263240	266680	uses techniques which makes it so hard for you to click off.
266680	270240	There's actually a science to making someone feel fully immersed in your video.
270240	274160	Let's investigate the tactics Mark is using to keep you watching.
274160	277520	At the start of all Mark's videos, he gives you a hook, context and setup.
277520	281840	I like to look at this as the what, why and how section of a video.
281840	285720	Mark explains very quickly what the video is about, gives context to why he is doing
285720	288080	it and then tells you how it's going to go down.
288080	291120	This means that the viewer has a clear understanding of what they are going to experience with
291120	292120	the video.
292120	294200	Let's look at this in action.
294200	299040	This is a bird feeder and everything to my left is my attempt at making a squirrel proof.
299040	302720	If they want the bird seed, they will first need to pass through what is basically an
302720	305480	8 part ninja warrior obstacle course for squirrels.
305480	310160	This course is extremely challenging, it is not for the timid of heart.
310160	314360	But out of the gate, I will admit that in hindsight, that I completely underestimated
314360	315360	my adversary.
315360	319240	Now if you're wondering why I would go through all this trouble, we need to go back 8 weeks
319240	322560	ago when I found myself stuck at home and very bored.
322560	325040	Next is the fact that Mark's videos have great pacing.
325040	329240	I genuinely think this is what separates good YouTubers from great YouTubers.
329240	333520	You need to realise the attention span of a YouTube viewer is pretty low, no offence.
333520	336360	So Mark overleaves no dull moments in his videos.
336360	339920	For example he could have spent ages showing everyone how he built the obstacle course,
339920	342720	but he instead made a really quick build montage.
342720	346640	Many YouTubers would have just kept this part in, but do people really need to see it?
346640	351800	We are here to see the squirrel version of Total Wipeout, not a carpentry lesson.
351800	354160	And finally Mark makes us wait for the result.
354160	357760	You need to carry people along for a reward at the end of the video.
357760	361440	Which in Mark's case is seeing whether the squirrels beat his course or not.
361440	365680	The magic is in pacing the video correctly, so the climax builds as you near the end,
365680	369160	keeping people watching from the first second until the conclusion.
369160	373360	Mark Rick was the first one to enter the course, so in the end, after about a week of effort,
373360	376280	it was fitting he was the one to make it to the jackpot first.
376280	380200	And he's so stoked, he apparently wants to run the whole course in reverse.
380200	383760	In hindsight we probably should have made the jackpot a little quieter.
383760	387760	So when Mark combines these retention tactics with a good video idea and storytelling, the
387760	391000	viewer has no choice but to stick around and watch the video.
391000	395440	The result is retention graphs that look like this, and let me tell you, YouTube loves nothing
395440	397240	more than a straight retention curve.
397440	400760	Alright, so that's how Mark makes people stay on his videos to give him great watch
400760	402360	time and retention.
402360	405560	But he of course needs people to actually click on them in the first place, which brings
405560	410120	us on to step number two, Mark uses killer metadata.
410120	413560	Metadata on YouTube is essentially everything you use to describe your video.
413560	417240	The main four types are titles, thumbnails, tags and descriptions.
417240	421520	Now a few years ago, your description and tags were very important, but in 2020 they're
421520	422520	pretty irrelevant.
422520	426440	I still like to fill them up with keywords and search terms, but using my YouTube tool
426640	431800	buddy, I can see that neither Mark Rober or MrBeast used any tags in their last upload,
431800	434320	and they both keep their descriptions pretty short.
434320	439400	I think this is a good sign not to pay too much attention to them anymore, with one exception.
439400	443320	Try using your first line in your video description as a teaser to your video, because this is
443320	445560	displayed in search.
445560	448760	So as for Mark's titles, there are a few things worth noting.
448760	451200	First of all, they are often under 50 characters.
451200	455640	This means that when viewed on mobile in your recommended feed, none of it is cut off.
455640	458520	This also leads to his titles being super pragmatic.
458520	462360	They're kind of hilariously casual, yet just testing if sharks can smell a drop of blood
462360	463880	and nothing much.
463880	466480	Being straight to the point gets rewarded on YouTube.
466480	470160	If you confuse someone with your title, they're not going to click.
470160	472520	But it's Mark's thumbnails that really make him stand out.
472520	475960	Now from looking at them, you might think they look a little amateurish, but this is
475960	476960	the point.
476960	479800	I talked about this in my first MrBeast video.
479800	481920	People love YouTube for the homemade feel of it.
481920	484680	It's why we watch our favorite creators instead of TV.
484680	488360	Such thumbnails with great graphic design might look more aesthetic, but that doesn't
488360	490520	always mean it's better.
490520	494120	Whenever Mark does use text, it's kept to four or less words, and the most important
494120	498200	part of the thumbnail is always the demonstration of what is actually happening.
498200	501840	Sometimes it's completely staged, such as this shark one, but he finds the balance between
501840	505200	clickbait and then actually delivering on his promise.
505200	507120	Thumbnails can make or break a YouTube video.
507120	510840	For example, I first used this thumbnail with my David Dobrik video and it got 10K views
510840	511840	in a week.
511840	514640	It then changed it to this one and it blew up to 200K views.
514640	518200	There's very little difference between them, but people just found this option much more
518200	519440	interesting.
519440	524280	One little change made me an extra $600 and brought in 1,900 subscribers.
524280	527920	While Mark's thumbnails might look simple, I guarantee you he spends ages trying to get
527920	529720	them just right.
529720	532520	I recommend making multiple thumbnails and comparing them.
532520	535440	If you are really trying to invest in your YouTube channel, you can use a tool like
535440	538440	TubeBuddy, which has a feature called A-B Testing.
538440	541820	You basically can load two different thumbnails into their software and they will rotate them
541820	545480	automatically on your video and measure the CTR for each one.
545480	548420	You can easily see which is best and go with that one.
548420	551380	You can install this software using my link below.
551380	554860	So this is how Mark Rober dominates the most important YouTube metrics.
554860	556480	It all seems pretty simple, right?
556480	559420	But the beauty is in executing it to perfection.
559420	562100	Don't go anywhere just yet though because there is one more step he is taking that I
562100	564520	think is so important to keep in mind.
564520	567780	He gives his videos breathing room.
567780	571020	Mark uploads just once per month, or even less at the moment.
571020	574400	Though I have heard he's got a pretty cool video with DudePerfect coming soon, so watch
574400	575400	out for that.
575400	579700	You see, YouTube is no longer a place that rewards sheer quantity.
579700	583960	Right now to stand out, you need to provide 10 times the quality you did 5 years ago.
583960	587520	If Mark uploaded weekly videos, I'm sure they would be good, but if he takes all that
587520	592740	effort and puts it into one video a month, it's going to be an insane video.
592740	596720	From an algorithm perspective, creating banger video after banger video means each upload
596720	602060	continues to ride the wave of success of the previous video, keeping his momentum alive.
602060	605800	Now uploading less might seem like pretty terrible advice, and of course it varies channel
605800	606800	to channel.
606800	610960	But the truth is, right now you might have a quality problem and not a quantity problem.
610960	614480	I really enjoyed making this video on Mark and I hope you learned as much from him as
614480	615960	I did myself.
615960	618880	Please smash the subscribe and turn the notifications on.
618880	622960	99% of you aren't subscribed, which is definitely a record.
622960	626320	Also give me a follow on Instagram, I post a lot of YouTube related content over there
626400	630360	including how much I'm making on YouTube and what my analytics look like.
630360	631960	For now though, I'll see you in the next one.
