1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,720
Mark Rober has quickly become one of my favorite YouTubers.

2
00:00:03,720 --> 00:00:08,160
His content is both entertaining and educational, so when I procrastinate and watch his videos,

3
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:11,000
I can at least say to myself that I'm learning something new.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
3, 2, 1...

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:24,100
However, what I find most fascinating about him is his growth here on YouTube.

6
00:00:24,100 --> 00:00:28,480
He averages a ridiculous 27 million views per video, and even when he's not uploading,

7
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:30,920
he still has a consistent stream of viewers coming in.

8
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:36,160
I mean, in the last 30 days, he hasn't uploaded a single video, but he has brought in 36 million

9
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:37,160
views.

10
00:00:37,160 --> 00:00:40,640
That's in the region of $100,000 in ad revenue.

11
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:44,960
How can one guy who uploads just 12 videos a year be growing so fast and dominating our

12
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:46,820
recommended feeds?

13
00:00:46,820 --> 00:00:50,080
Maybe Mark Rober knows something that we don't about YouTube.

14
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:53,400
In this video, we're going to break down how he is beating the algorithm to reach new

15
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:55,120
people every day.

16
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:58,520
If you're a smaller creator who wants to grow your own channel, get out your notebook

17
00:00:58,520 --> 00:01:02,680
and get ready for a Mark Rober YouTube Masterclass.

18
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:06,200
On this channel, I like to analyze the biggest and fastest growing YouTubers and get to the

19
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:08,240
bottom of how they have built their audiences.

20
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:12,600
Now, if you were to ask Mark himself about the secret to his success, he would probably

21
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:15,440
give you a very humble answer like this.

22
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:18,360
Your videos get 27 million views on average.

23
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:19,360
Is this true?

24
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:20,360
This is true.

25
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:22,760
It's actually the most on all of YouTube.

26
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:23,760
What is the secret?

27
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:26,240
I do like wholesome stuff.

28
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:30,440
I like doing things that are big and crazy in a world's largest Nerf gun, world's largest

29
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:31,440
Super Soaker.

30
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:33,120
But let's be real for a minute.

31
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:36,040
Top YouTubers understand how the algorithm works.

32
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:39,440
They know what sort of content to make and what tactics to use to bring in millions of

33
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:40,440
views.

34
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:44,280
Do you think a guy who helps put a robot on Mars just makes wholesome content and hopes

35
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:45,360
for the best?

36
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:47,320
We know you're smarter than that, Mark.

37
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:50,760
Through my research, I've broken down the three steps Mark Rober uses with every video

38
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:53,160
to give it the best chance of going viral.

39
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:56,080
And I don't even want to hype this up too much, but some of the things that he is doing

40
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:59,920
will make you realise just how much thought goes into every upload.

41
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:03,360
The best part is these are steps that anyone can learn from to make better videos and get

42
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:04,360
more views.

43
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:08,720
Let's get straight into things.

44
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:14,920
So, now what?

45
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:18,480
I'm using the phrase beating the algorithm, but really when it comes to what Mark Rober

46
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:22,440
is doing, it's about giving the algorithm exactly what it wants.

47
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:25,880
Mark Rober uses their algorithm to help surface videos that people will click on and watch

48
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:29,760
because at the end of the day, they want people to stay on their site.

49
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:32,720
Using this graph, we can understand how content goes viral.

50
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:34,960
Let's take this video here as an example.

51
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:37,640
When it was first uploaded, it was shown to a certain number of people.

52
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:40,960
Let's call this group of people the early audience.

53
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:43,920
These are viewers who have recently watched Mark's videos before and a high percentage

54
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:45,920
will be subscribers.

55
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:50,280
If the video performs well in the data here, it will be shown to more of this group.

56
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:54,400
The viral moment comes when YouTube starts to show this video to a wider audience and

57
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:57,100
it still performs really well.

58
00:02:57,100 --> 00:03:01,640
This tells YouTube that the video appears to a lot of people, not only fans of Mark Rober,

59
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:05,720
so they start to recommend it to more and more people who they feel will enjoy the content.

60
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:08,700
This is often called the algorithm picking up a video.

61
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:12,360
It keeps being recommended until it eventually begins to plateau and decline.

62
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:16,320
Now, obviously a YouTuber like Mark Rober has the head start of having a big subscriber

63
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:20,640
base, but it's pretty much the same idea no matter how small the channel is.

64
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:24,320
The important question is how do YouTube decide if a video is performing well?

65
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:26,480
What data do they actually look at?

66
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:29,440
And if you've watched this channel before, you already know what I'm going to say are

67
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:31,560
the three most important metrics.

68
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:34,480
Click through it, watch time and audience retention.

69
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:37,640
When it comes to viral videos, this is the Holy Trinity and you can bet your ass that

70
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:40,760
Mark Rober is dominating these metrics.

71
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:44,880
It varies a lot, but if you can get over 4 minutes of watch time with a 50% or above

72
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:51,240
audience retention and a 10-20% CTR, you have a really good chance of going viral.

73
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:55,680
The last time I hit those figures myself, this happened.

74
00:03:55,680 --> 00:04:00,800
So what is Mark doing to make sure that every video he makes smashes each of these metrics?

75
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:05,080
Now obviously making videos on fascinating ideas and having a big budget helps, but lots

76
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:08,880
of people try and copy this and never see a fraction of the results.

77
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:13,720
Let's first look at step one, how he structures his videos using retention tactics.

78
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:17,400
Has anyone ever noticed that when you click on a Mark Rober video, 10 minutes goes by

79
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:19,720
in the blink of an eye?

80
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:23,240
You might just think it's because he makes awesome videos, which is true, but he also

81
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:26,680
uses techniques which makes it so hard for you to click off.

82
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:30,240
There's actually a science to making someone feel fully immersed in your video.

83
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:34,160
Let's investigate the tactics Mark is using to keep you watching.

84
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:37,520
At the start of all Mark's videos, he gives you a hook, context and setup.

85
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:41,840
I like to look at this as the what, why and how section of a video.

86
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:45,720
Mark explains very quickly what the video is about, gives context to why he is doing

87
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:48,080
it and then tells you how it's going to go down.

88
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:51,120
This means that the viewer has a clear understanding of what they are going to experience with

89
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:52,120
the video.

90
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:54,200
Let's look at this in action.

91
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:59,040
This is a bird feeder and everything to my left is my attempt at making a squirrel proof.

92
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:02,720
If they want the bird seed, they will first need to pass through what is basically an

93
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:05,480
8 part ninja warrior obstacle course for squirrels.

94
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:10,160
This course is extremely challenging, it is not for the timid of heart.

95
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:14,360
But out of the gate, I will admit that in hindsight, that I completely underestimated

96
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:15,360
my adversary.

97
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:19,240
Now if you're wondering why I would go through all this trouble, we need to go back 8 weeks

98
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:22,560
ago when I found myself stuck at home and very bored.

99
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:25,040
Next is the fact that Mark's videos have great pacing.

100
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:29,240
I genuinely think this is what separates good YouTubers from great YouTubers.

101
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:33,520
You need to realise the attention span of a YouTube viewer is pretty low, no offence.

102
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:36,360
So Mark overleaves no dull moments in his videos.

103
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:39,920
For example he could have spent ages showing everyone how he built the obstacle course,

104
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:42,720
but he instead made a really quick build montage.

105
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:46,640
Many YouTubers would have just kept this part in, but do people really need to see it?

106
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:51,800
We are here to see the squirrel version of Total Wipeout, not a carpentry lesson.

107
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:54,160
And finally Mark makes us wait for the result.

108
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:57,760
You need to carry people along for a reward at the end of the video.

109
00:05:57,760 --> 00:06:01,440
Which in Mark's case is seeing whether the squirrels beat his course or not.

110
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:05,680
The magic is in pacing the video correctly, so the climax builds as you near the end,

111
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:09,160
keeping people watching from the first second until the conclusion.

112
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:13,360
Mark Rick was the first one to enter the course, so in the end, after about a week of effort,

113
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:16,280
it was fitting he was the one to make it to the jackpot first.

114
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:20,200
And he's so stoked, he apparently wants to run the whole course in reverse.

115
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:23,760
In hindsight we probably should have made the jackpot a little quieter.

116
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:27,760
So when Mark combines these retention tactics with a good video idea and storytelling, the

117
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:31,000
viewer has no choice but to stick around and watch the video.

118
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:35,440
The result is retention graphs that look like this, and let me tell you, YouTube loves nothing

119
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:37,240
more than a straight retention curve.

120
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:40,760
Alright, so that's how Mark makes people stay on his videos to give him great watch

121
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:42,360
time and retention.

122
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:45,560
But he of course needs people to actually click on them in the first place, which brings

123
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:50,120
us on to step number two, Mark uses killer metadata.

124
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:53,560
Metadata on YouTube is essentially everything you use to describe your video.

125
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:57,240
The main four types are titles, thumbnails, tags and descriptions.

126
00:06:57,240 --> 00:07:01,520
Now a few years ago, your description and tags were very important, but in 2020 they're

127
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:02,520
pretty irrelevant.

128
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:06,440
I still like to fill them up with keywords and search terms, but using my YouTube tool

129
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:11,800
buddy, I can see that neither Mark Rober or MrBeast used any tags in their last upload,

130
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:14,320
and they both keep their descriptions pretty short.

131
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:19,400
I think this is a good sign not to pay too much attention to them anymore, with one exception.

132
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:23,320
Try using your first line in your video description as a teaser to your video, because this is

133
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:25,560
displayed in search.

134
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:28,760
So as for Mark's titles, there are a few things worth noting.

135
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:31,200
First of all, they are often under 50 characters.

136
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:35,640
This means that when viewed on mobile in your recommended feed, none of it is cut off.

137
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:38,520
This also leads to his titles being super pragmatic.

138
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:42,360
They're kind of hilariously casual, yet just testing if sharks can smell a drop of blood

139
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:43,880
and nothing much.

140
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:46,480
Being straight to the point gets rewarded on YouTube.

141
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:50,160
If you confuse someone with your title, they're not going to click.

142
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:52,520
But it's Mark's thumbnails that really make him stand out.

143
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:55,960
Now from looking at them, you might think they look a little amateurish, but this is

144
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:56,960
the point.

145
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:59,800
I talked about this in my first MrBeast video.

146
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:01,920
People love YouTube for the homemade feel of it.

147
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:04,680
It's why we watch our favorite creators instead of TV.

148
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:08,360
Such thumbnails with great graphic design might look more aesthetic, but that doesn't

149
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:10,520
always mean it's better.

150
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:14,120
Whenever Mark does use text, it's kept to four or less words, and the most important

151
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:18,200
part of the thumbnail is always the demonstration of what is actually happening.

152
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:21,840
Sometimes it's completely staged, such as this shark one, but he finds the balance between

153
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:25,200
clickbait and then actually delivering on his promise.

154
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:27,120
Thumbnails can make or break a YouTube video.

155
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:30,840
For example, I first used this thumbnail with my David Dobrik video and it got 10K views

156
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:31,840
in a week.

157
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:34,640
It then changed it to this one and it blew up to 200K views.

158
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:38,200
There's very little difference between them, but people just found this option much more

159
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:39,440
interesting.

160
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:44,280
One little change made me an extra $600 and brought in 1,900 subscribers.

161
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:47,920
While Mark's thumbnails might look simple, I guarantee you he spends ages trying to get

162
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:49,720
them just right.

163
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:52,520
I recommend making multiple thumbnails and comparing them.

164
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:55,440
If you are really trying to invest in your YouTube channel, you can use a tool like

165
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:58,440
TubeBuddy, which has a feature called A-B Testing.

166
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:01,820
You basically can load two different thumbnails into their software and they will rotate them

167
00:09:01,820 --> 00:09:05,480
automatically on your video and measure the CTR for each one.

168
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:08,420
You can easily see which is best and go with that one.

169
00:09:08,420 --> 00:09:11,380
You can install this software using my link below.

170
00:09:11,380 --> 00:09:14,860
So this is how Mark Rober dominates the most important YouTube metrics.

171
00:09:14,860 --> 00:09:16,480
It all seems pretty simple, right?

172
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:19,420
But the beauty is in executing it to perfection.

173
00:09:19,420 --> 00:09:22,100
Don't go anywhere just yet though because there is one more step he is taking that I

174
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:24,520
think is so important to keep in mind.

175
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:27,780
He gives his videos breathing room.

176
00:09:27,780 --> 00:09:31,020
Mark uploads just once per month, or even less at the moment.

177
00:09:31,020 --> 00:09:34,400
Though I have heard he's got a pretty cool video with DudePerfect coming soon, so watch

178
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:35,400
out for that.

179
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:39,700
You see, YouTube is no longer a place that rewards sheer quantity.

180
00:09:39,700 --> 00:09:43,960
Right now to stand out, you need to provide 10 times the quality you did 5 years ago.

181
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:47,520
If Mark uploaded weekly videos, I'm sure they would be good, but if he takes all that

182
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:52,740
effort and puts it into one video a month, it's going to be an insane video.

183
00:09:52,740 --> 00:09:56,720
From an algorithm perspective, creating banger video after banger video means each upload

184
00:09:56,720 --> 00:10:02,060
continues to ride the wave of success of the previous video, keeping his momentum alive.

185
00:10:02,060 --> 00:10:05,800
Now uploading less might seem like pretty terrible advice, and of course it varies channel

186
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:06,800
to channel.

187
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:10,960
But the truth is, right now you might have a quality problem and not a quantity problem.

188
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:14,480
I really enjoyed making this video on Mark and I hope you learned as much from him as

189
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:15,960
I did myself.

190
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:18,880
Please smash the subscribe and turn the notifications on.

191
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:22,960
99% of you aren't subscribed, which is definitely a record.

192
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:26,320
Also give me a follow on Instagram, I post a lot of YouTube related content over there

193
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:30,360
including how much I'm making on YouTube and what my analytics look like.

194
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:31,960
For now though, I'll see you in the next one.
