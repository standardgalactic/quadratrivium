27500	29500	As you know that guys, the social media is that platform
29500	34500	that we connect the each and every persons of any states, any country.

39500	44500	And every persons are going to tourist place to around that place.
44500	47500	And you should already know that that is why that every person disconnects
47500	51500	with their persons where they live.
51500	54500	And we should already know that through the social media,
54500	57500	that persons connect that peoples where they are lives.
57500	59500	And you should already know that in this times of educations

104500	112500	there are tons of downloaders of games and there are less downloaders of education channels.
112500	117500	Then you should already know that there are lots of persons who also do better things
117500	120500	and they also do wrong things.
120500	123500	And then if we focus better things, then we can get better.

137500	142500	And there are lots of peoples who doesn't go there to listen their lectures
142500	145500	then also they are able and live in the social media.
145500	148500	And through the social media, we get lots of things.
148500	152500	And also if we feel that the social media making us more social.

178500	182500	You know Mr. you said that due to social media means we can connect,
182500	184500	means each and every person.
184500	192500	I mean who is going anywhere means who is going to celebrate holiday.
192500	197500	That's why means social media is more social.
197500	202500	But don't you think Mr. due to social media means many peoples using in wrong way.
202500	206500	You already know that many peoples means don't focus their career.
206500	210500	Well Mr. as you said that there are lots of peoples through the social media.
210500	212500	They are using social media and they don't focus this career.

216500	218500	who use the social media in better way.
218500	224500	And if we think like better, if we think positive then we can go in positive and develop.

302500	306500	As you said that in this times 80% students do online education.
306500	308500	Firstly listen Mr.
308500	314500	Then why are you talking about only that students who use the social media to see the comedy videos and entertainment.
314500	316500	So if I tell you Mr.
316500	317500	Well Miss
317500	321500	Means whatever you mention in your content sir I am totally disagree with you.
321500	323500	As you said that social media is making us more social.
323500	326500	But from my perspective social media is making us less social.
326500	328500	And why I am saying like this there are tons of reason.
328500	329500	You know Mr.
329500	334500	Now in this time means 99% people out of 100% people use social media.
334500	342500	And they are means child means children's youth is and some person who don't use social media because they are illiterate.
342500	343500	But you know Mr.
343500	348500	If means due to social media means every person disconnect with their family members.
348500	349500	Because you know Mr.
349500	352500	Now in this time every person busy in their cell phones.
352500	357500	And they don't means focus on what's happen in family.
357500	358500	But and you also
358500	359500	How give us in this time
359500	360500	In this time
360500	369500	You also know that means in this time means social media is a very means I want to say that social media make us.
369500	372500	Due to social media we have lack of confidence.
372500	373500	You know Mr.
373500	380500	Now in olden time people used to go to on stage and to share their ideas and views about any topic.
380500	382500	And they means share their thoughts.
382500	383500	And but now
383500	384500	Well Mr.
384500	385500	As you said that
385500	386500	Well Mr.
386500	387500	Firstly listen to me.
387500	391500	And now in this time means people hesitate to go on stage and speak something.
391500	396500	They feel signs come in with each other.
396500	400500	Because of social media they are disconnect with their persons.
400500	407500	Well as you said that there are lots of people in olden times do go on stage and give their opinions about the lots of people.
407500	413500	Then in this time you should already know that you are also say that 80% and 100% people are using social media.
413500	419500	Then you should already know that if that persons go to stage and give their opinions throughout some people.
419500	424500	And in this time if you use social media and if we give our opinion in social media
424500	427500	Then there's 100% people give your opinions.
427500	428500	But you know Mr.
429500	432500	People use social media.
432500	436500	And also you said that it means just because of social media.
436500	438500	Many people are distracted from their family.
438500	439500	But Mr.
439500	445500	Now after 10 to 12 people go to other stage to do it.
445500	448500	And just because of social media we are connected from our family members.
448500	449500	And also Mr.
449500	452500	Now is this time of leave.
452500	454500	And it means every people are celebrating holiday.
454500	456500	And just because of that we are connected with our friends.
456500	460500	And then we are taking selfie because we catch the beautiful moments in our camera.
460500	465500	Because if we have that then we can never forget that where we go and where we mistake.
465500	471500	And as you already know that means just because of social media people have less confidence.
471500	476500	Then I would like to tell that in this time there are lots of motivational channel.
476500	481500	And if we see that motivational channel then also we can motivate and also we can get a lot of confidence.
481500	482500	But you know Mr.
482500	485500	You are talking about they can make videos
485500	486500	And share on social media.
486500	487500	But you know Mr.
487500	493500	If all the people means use social media and due to this their eyes means eye problem.
493500	494500	And they will go.
494500	497500	So if we talk about eye problem also.
497500	499500	So if we talk about eye problem on Facebook.
499500	502500	And you also suppose that means people go.
502500	503500	There are lots of cases.
503500	504500	I love accident.
504500	506500	And if we go to miss road then I saw the accident.
506500	507500	Well missed the.
507500	508500	Well missed the.
508500	513500	And if there is lots of people gathered in any place then if that person have any enemies
513500	515500	then he also killed that person.
515500	518500	And in the social media you are safe in your home.

522500	526500	As your Mrs. said that in the social media we are lack confidence.
526500	532500	Then as you already said that 80% or 100% people are using social media.
532500	538500	Then if we give our opinions in that platform then we have we are our confidence increase
538500	540500	because there are lots of people.
540500	546500	And if we say any wrong things then lots of people comment your post that it is wrong
546500	547500	and it is bad.
547500	548500	It is bad.
548500	552500	And if you give better opinion then your confidence will increase.
552500	559500	And if you don't better then also your confidence will decrease because and you do better that
559500	560500	that.
560500	562500	Sorry point of some can I say something here.

569500	570500	go with any person.
570500	571500	But don't you think Mr.
571500	576500	Means also due to social media people is going to become lazy person because they are not
576500	582500	going to work they are not means also children are not going to play I mean any type of game
