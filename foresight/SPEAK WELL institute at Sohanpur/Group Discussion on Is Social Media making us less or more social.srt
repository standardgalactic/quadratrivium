Well, mister.

7
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,500
Well guys, as you know that this is Mr. Prince Khusa from Saunpur.

8
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:16,000
And you already know that the topic has been given us to discuss about

9
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
is social media making us less social or more social.

10
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
So, it is a fantabulous topic.

11
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,500
So, from my point of view, is social media making us more social?

12
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:26,500
Because there are lots of reason behind it.

13
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:27,500
So, let me explain.

14
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:29,500
As you know that guys, the social media is that platform

15
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:34,500
that we connect the each and every persons of any states, any country.

16
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:39,500
Then you should already know that in this time, they are in the times of holidays.

17
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:44,500
And every persons are going to tourist place to around that place.

18
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:47,500
And you should already know that that is why that every person disconnects

19
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:51,500
with their persons where they live.

20
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:54,500
And we should already know that through the social media,

21
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:57,500
that persons connect that peoples where they are lives.

22
00:00:57,500 --> 00:00:59,500
And you should already know that in this times of educations

23
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:06,500
and in this times of get result of any UP boards, any 12th, 10th result.

24
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:12,500
Then through the social media, each and every students get that result immediately.

25
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:15,500
And any information come through the social media.

26
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:23,500
And in this times, if I talk about the news, then if any events happen in our India,

27
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:30,500
through the social media, every persons know that how in whatever happened in our country.

28
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:35,500
And through the social media, we earn more and more money and also we get educations.

29
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:39,500
And there are lots of peoples who do better in their lives

30
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:41,500
and get success in their lives through the social media.

31
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:44,500
And if I talk about likes, there are lots of people say that

32
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:52,500
there are tons of downloaders of games and there are less downloaders of education channels.

33
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:57,500
Then you should already know that there are lots of persons who also do better things

34
00:01:57,500 --> 00:02:00,500
and they also do wrong things.

35
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:03,500
And then if we focus better things, then we can get better.

36
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:08,500
And as we know that guys through the social media in this times,

37
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:13,500
every persons like also prime minister like prime minister Modi,

38
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:17,500
he also get the lecture online also offline.

39
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:22,500
And there are lots of peoples who doesn't go there to listen their lectures

40
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:25,500
then also they are able and live in the social media.

41
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:28,500
And through the social media, we get lots of things.

42
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:32,500
And also if we feel that the social media making us more social.

43
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:36,500
So keeping this all pointing to my account, I must say that social media making us more social.

44
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:41,500
So I invite all of you to join this GD and make this GD more and more successful.

45
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:47,500
Thank you Mr. for inviting me us in this GD.

46
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:52,500
First of all I want to say that you said that social media is making us less, means more social.

47
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:56,500
But I don't think like this. According to me, social media is making us less social.

48
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:58,500
Why I am saying so let me explain.

49
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:02,500
You know Mr. you said that due to social media means we can connect,

50
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:04,500
means each and every person.

51
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:12,500
I mean who is going anywhere means who is going to celebrate holiday.

52
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:17,500
That's why means social media is more social.

53
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:22,500
But don't you think Mr. due to social media means many peoples using in wrong way.

54
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:26,500
You already know that many peoples means don't focus their career.

55
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:30,500
Well Mr. as you said that there are lots of peoples through the social media.

56
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:32,500
They are using social media and they don't focus this career.

57
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:36,500
Then if I talk about social media then you said I don't know that there are lots of peoples

58
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:38,500
who use the social media in better way.

59
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:44,500
And if we think like better, if we think positive then we can go in positive and develop.

60
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:49,500
Through the social media as you know first listen Mr. through the social media we know current things.

61
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:51,500
Whatever happened in our country.

So what's your take on this?

63
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:58,500
But don't you think Mr. you also stated that due to social media means we are lots of money.

64
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:05,500
But don't you think now this means lots of people means one to increase our subscriber and flower on social media.

65
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:07,500
Means just like a YouTube and Instagram.

00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:17,500

As you said that there are lots of people spend lots of money to get the subscribers.

As you already know that in the YouTube if your subscribers increase then after some days

72
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:31,500
you get lots of money according to your views.

73
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:33,500
And according to your subscriber.

You already know that also children use social media.

81
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:59,500
Means they use Instagram and also YouTube for watch comedy video and entertainment.

82
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:00,500
If they use that...

83
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:01,500
Then Mr.

84
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:02,500
Well Mr.

As you said that in this times 80% students do online education.

86
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:08,500
Firstly listen Mr.

87
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:14,500
Then why are you talking about only that students who use the social media to see the comedy videos and entertainment.

88
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:16,500
So if I tell you Mr.

89
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:17,500
Well Miss

90
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:21,500
Means whatever you mention in your content sir I am totally disagree with you.

91
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:23,500
As you said that social media is making us more social.

92
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:26,500
But from my perspective social media is making us less social.

93
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:28,500
And why I am saying like this there are tons of reason.

94
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:29,500
You know Mr.

95
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:34,500
Now in this time means 99% people out of 100% people use social media.

96
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:42,500
And they are means child means children's youth is and some person who don't use social media because they are illiterate.

97
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:43,500
But you know Mr.

98
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:48,500
If means due to social media means every person disconnect with their family members.

99
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:49,500
Because you know Mr.

100
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:52,500
Now in this time every person busy in their cell phones.

101
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:57,500
And they don't means focus on what's happen in family.

102
00:05:57,500 --> 00:05:58,500
But and you also

103
00:05:58,500 --> 00:05:59,500
How give us in this time

You also know that means in this time means social media is a very means I want to say that social media make us.

106
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:12,500
Due to social media we have lack of confidence.

107
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:13,500
You know Mr.

108
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:20,500
Now in olden time people used to go to on stage and to share their ideas and views about any topic.

109
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:22,500
And they means share their thoughts.

110
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:23,500
And but now

111
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:24,500
Well Mr.

112
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:25,500
As you said that

113
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:26,500
Well Mr.

114
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:27,500
Firstly listen to me.

115
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:31,500
And now in this time means people hesitate to go on stage and speak something.

116
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:36,500
They feel signs come in with each other.

117
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:40,500
Because of social media they are disconnect with their persons.

118
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:47,500
Well as you said that there are lots of people in olden times do go on stage and give their opinions about the lots of people.

119
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:53,500
Then in this time you should already know that you are also say that 80% and 100% people are using social media.

120
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:59,500
Then you should already know that if that persons go to stage and give their opinions throughout some people.

121
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:04,500
And in this time if you use social media and if we give our opinion in social media

122
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:07,500
Then there's 100% people give your opinions.

123
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:08,500
But you know Mr.

124
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:12,500
People use social media.

125
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:16,500
And also you said that it means just because of social media.

126
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:18,500
Many people are distracted from their family.

127
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:19,500
But Mr.

128
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:25,500
Now after 10 to 12 people go to other stage to do it.

129
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:28,500
And just because of social media we are connected from our family members.

130
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:29,500
And also Mr.

131
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:32,500
Now is this time of leave.

132
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:34,500
And it means every people are celebrating holiday.

133
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:36,500
And just because of that we are connected with our friends.

134
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:40,500
And then we are taking selfie because we catch the beautiful moments in our camera.

135
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:45,500
Because if we have that then we can never forget that where we go and where we mistake.

136
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:51,500
And as you already know that means just because of social media people have less confidence.

137
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:56,500
Then I would like to tell that in this time there are lots of motivational channel.

138
00:07:56,500 --> 00:08:01,500
And if we see that motivational channel then also we can motivate and also we can get a lot of confidence.

139
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:02,500
But you know Mr.

140
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:05,500
You are talking about they can make videos

141
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:06,500
And share on social media.

142
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:07,500
But you know Mr.

143
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:13,500
If all the people means use social media and due to this their eyes means eye problem.

144
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:14,500
And they will go.

145
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:17,500
So if we talk about eye problem also.

146
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:19,500
So if we talk about eye problem on Facebook.

147
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:22,500
And you also suppose that means people go.

148
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:23,500
There are lots of cases.

149
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:24,500
I love accident.

150
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:26,500
And if we go to miss road then I saw the accident.

151
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:27,500
Well missed the.

152
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:28,500
Well missed the.

153
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:33,500
And if there is lots of people gathered in any place then if that person have any enemies

154
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:35,500
then he also killed that person.

155
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:38,500
And in the social media you are safe in your home.

156
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:39,500
Well Mr.

157
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:40,500
Well Mr.

158
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:41,500
Firstly listen Mr.

159
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:42,500
Firstly listen Mr.

160
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:46,500
As your Mrs. said that in the social media we are lack confidence.

161
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:52,500
Then as you already said that 80% or 100% people are using social media.

162
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:58,500
Then if we give our opinions in that platform then we have we are our confidence increase

163
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:00,500
because there are lots of people.

164
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:06,500
And if we say any wrong things then lots of people comment your post that it is wrong

165
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:07,500
and it is bad.

166
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:08,500
It is bad.

167
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:12,500
And if you give better opinion then your confidence will increase.

168
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:19,500
And if you don't better then also your confidence will decrease because and you do better that

169
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:20,500
that.

170
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:22,500
