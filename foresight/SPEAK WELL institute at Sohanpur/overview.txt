 The discussion revolves around the impact of social media on society, particularly focusing on how it may lead to people becoming lazy and neglecting physical activities such as work or play. The point is made that due to the convenience of social media, individuals might prefer staying indoors, interacting virtually instead of engaging in real-world activities. This could potentially result in a sedentary lifestyle, which might affect health negatively. The concern is that the widespread use of social media platforms could make people less inclined to physically interact or play games with others, thus impacting their overall fitness and well-being.
