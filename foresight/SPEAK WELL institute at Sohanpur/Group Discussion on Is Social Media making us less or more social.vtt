00:12.500 --> 00:16.000
And you already know that the topic has been given us to discuss about

00:16.000 --> 00:19.000
is social media making us less social or more social.

00:19.000 --> 00:21.000
So, it is a fantabulous topic.

00:21.000 --> 00:24.500
So, from my point of view, is social media making us more social?

00:24.500 --> 00:26.500
Because there are lots of reason behind it.

00:26.500 --> 00:27.500
So, let me explain.

00:27.500 --> 00:29.500
As you know that guys, the social media is that platform

00:29.500 --> 00:34.500
that we connect the each and every persons of any states, any country.

00:34.500 --> 00:39.500
Then you should already know that in this time, they are in the times of holidays.

00:39.500 --> 00:44.500
And every persons are going to tourist place to around that place.

00:44.500 --> 00:47.500
And you should already know that that is why that every person disconnects

00:47.500 --> 00:51.500
with their persons where they live.

00:51.500 --> 00:54.500
And we should already know that through the social media,

00:54.500 --> 00:57.500
that persons connect that peoples where they are lives.

00:57.500 --> 00:59.500
And you should already know that in this times of educations

00:59.500 --> 01:06.500
and in this times of get result of any UP boards, any 12th, 10th result.

01:06.500 --> 01:12.500
Then through the social media, each and every students get that result immediately.

01:12.500 --> 01:15.500
And any information come through the social media.

01:15.500 --> 01:23.500
And in this times, if I talk about the news, then if any events happen in our India,

01:23.500 --> 01:30.500
through the social media, every persons know that how in whatever happened in our country.

01:30.500 --> 01:35.500
And through the social media, we earn more and more money and also we get educations.

01:35.500 --> 01:39.500
And there are lots of peoples who do better in their lives

01:39.500 --> 01:41.500
and get success in their lives through the social media.

01:41.500 --> 01:44.500
And if I talk about likes, there are lots of people say that

01:44.500 --> 01:52.500
there are tons of downloaders of games and there are less downloaders of education channels.

01:52.500 --> 01:57.500
Then you should already know that there are lots of persons who also do better things

01:57.500 --> 02:00.500
and they also do wrong things.

02:00.500 --> 02:03.500
And then if we focus better things, then we can get better.

02:03.500 --> 02:08.500
And as we know that guys through the social media in this times,

02:08.500 --> 02:13.500
every persons like also prime minister like prime minister Modi,

02:13.500 --> 02:17.500
he also get the lecture online also offline.

02:17.500 --> 02:22.500
And there are lots of peoples who doesn't go there to listen their lectures

02:22.500 --> 02:25.500
then also they are able and live in the social media.

02:25.500 --> 02:28.500
And through the social media, we get lots of things.

02:28.500 --> 02:32.500
And also if we feel that the social media making us more social.

02:32.500 --> 02:36.500
So keeping this all pointing to my account, I must say that social media making us more social.

02:36.500 --> 02:41.500

02:42.500 --> 02:47.500
Thank you Mr. for inviting me us in this GD.

02:47.500 --> 02:52.500
First of all I want to say that you said that social media is making us less, means more social.

02:52.500 --> 02:56.500
But I don't think like this. According to me, social media is making us less social.

02:56.500 --> 02:58.500
Why I am saying so let me explain.

02:58.500 --> 03:02.500
You know Mr. you said that due to social media means we can connect,

03:02.500 --> 03:04.500
means each and every person.

03:04.500 --> 03:12.500
I mean who is going anywhere means who is going to celebrate holiday.

03:12.500 --> 03:17.500
That's why means social media is more social.

03:17.500 --> 03:22.500
But don't you think Mr. due to social media means many peoples using in wrong way.

03:22.500 --> 03:26.500
You already know that many peoples means don't focus their career.

03:26.500 --> 03:30.500
Well Mr. as you said that there are lots of peoples through the social media.

03:30.500 --> 03:32.500
They are using social media and they don't focus this career.

03:32.500 --> 03:36.500
Then if I talk about social media then you said I don't know that there are lots of peoples

03:36.500 --> 03:38.500
who use the social media in better way.

03:38.500 --> 03:44.500
And if we think like better, if we think positive then we can go in positive and develop.

03:44.500 --> 03:49.500
Through the social media as you know first listen Mr. through the social media we know current things.

03:49.500 --> 03:51.500
Whatever happened in our country.

03:51.500 --> 03:53.500
So what's your take on this?

03:53.500 --> 03:58.500
But don't you think Mr. you also stated that due to social media means we are lots of money.

03:58.500 --> 04:05.500
But don't you think now this means lots of people means one to increase our subscriber and flower on social media.

04:05.500 --> 04:07.500
Means just like a YouTube and Instagram.

04:07.500 --> 04:10.500
You already know that they are spending lots of money.

04:10.500 --> 04:13.500
If they spend lots of money then absolutely it's a very...

04:13.500 --> 04:14.500
Well Mr.

04:14.500 --> 04:17.500
Well firstly listen.

04:17.500 --> 04:21.500
As you said that there are lots of people spend lots of money to get the subscribers.

04:21.500 --> 04:27.500
As you already know that in the YouTube if your subscribers increase then after some days

04:27.500 --> 04:31.500
you get lots of money according to your views.

04:31.500 --> 04:33.500
And according to your subscriber.

04:33.500 --> 04:39.500
Means when your channel monetize then absolutely firstly you need to do lots of hard work.

04:39.500 --> 04:40.500
Because you can...

04:40.500 --> 04:43.500
Well Mr. could you please tell us that without hard work you get success.

04:43.500 --> 04:46.500
Absolutely if you have intelligence you can get success.

04:46.500 --> 04:47.500
Well Mr.

04:47.500 --> 04:48.500
Well Mr.

04:48.500 --> 04:53.500
You already know that also children use social media.

04:53.500 --> 04:59.500
Means they use Instagram and also YouTube for watch comedy video and entertainment.

04:59.500 --> 05:00.500
If they use that...

05:00.500 --> 05:01.500
Then Mr.

05:01.500 --> 05:02.500
Well Mr.

05:02.500 --> 05:06.500
As you said that in this times 80% students do online education.

05:06.500 --> 05:08.500
Firstly listen Mr.

05:08.500 --> 05:14.500
Then why are you talking about only that students who use the social media to see the comedy videos and entertainment.

05:14.500 --> 05:16.500
So if I tell you Mr.

05:16.500 --> 05:17.500
Well Miss

05:17.500 --> 05:21.500
Means whatever you mention in your content sir I am totally disagree with you.

05:21.500 --> 05:23.500
As you said that social media is making us more social.

05:23.500 --> 05:26.500
But from my perspective social media is making us less social.

05:26.500 --> 05:28.500
And why I am saying like this there are tons of reason.

05:28.500 --> 05:29.500
You know Mr.

05:29.500 --> 05:34.500
Now in this time means 99% people out of 100% people use social media.

05:34.500 --> 05:42.500
And they are means child means children's youth is and some person who don't use social media because they are illiterate.

05:42.500 --> 05:43.500
But you know Mr.

05:43.500 --> 05:48.500
If means due to social media means every person disconnect with their family members.

05:48.500 --> 05:49.500
Because you know Mr.

05:49.500 --> 05:52.500
Now in this time every person busy in their cell phones.

05:52.500 --> 05:57.500
And they don't means focus on what's happen in family.

05:57.500 --> 05:58.500
But and you also

05:58.500 --> 05:59.500
How give us in this time

05:59.500 --> 06:00.500
In this time

06:00.500 --> 06:09.500
You also know that means in this time means social media is a very means I want to say that social media make us.

06:09.500 --> 06:12.500
Due to social media we have lack of confidence.

06:12.500 --> 06:13.500
You know Mr.

06:13.500 --> 06:20.500
Now in olden time people used to go to on stage and to share their ideas and views about any topic.

06:20.500 --> 06:22.500
And they means share their thoughts.

06:22.500 --> 06:23.500
And but now

06:23.500 --> 06:24.500
Well Mr.

06:24.500 --> 06:25.500
As you said that

06:25.500 --> 06:26.500
Well Mr.

06:26.500 --> 06:27.500
Firstly listen to me.

06:27.500 --> 06:31.500
And now in this time means people hesitate to go on stage and speak something.

06:31.500 --> 06:36.500
They feel signs come in with each other.

06:36.500 --> 06:40.500
Because of social media they are disconnect with their persons.

06:40.500 --> 06:47.500
Well as you said that there are lots of people in olden times do go on stage and give their opinions about the lots of people.

06:47.500 --> 06:53.500
Then in this time you should already know that you are also say that 80% and 100% people are using social media.

06:53.500 --> 06:59.500
Then you should already know that if that persons go to stage and give their opinions throughout some people.

06:59.500 --> 07:04.500
And in this time if you use social media and if we give our opinion in social media

07:04.500 --> 07:07.500
Then there's 100% people give your opinions.

07:07.500 --> 07:08.500
But you know Mr.

07:09.500 --> 07:12.500
People use social media.

07:12.500 --> 07:16.500
And also you said that it means just because of social media.

07:16.500 --> 07:18.500
Many people are distracted from their family.

07:18.500 --> 07:19.500
But Mr.

07:19.500 --> 07:25.500
Now after 10 to 12 people go to other stage to do it.

07:25.500 --> 07:28.500
And just because of social media we are connected from our family members.

07:28.500 --> 07:29.500
And also Mr.

07:29.500 --> 07:32.500
Now is this time of leave.

07:32.500 --> 07:34.500
And it means every people are celebrating holiday.

07:34.500 --> 07:36.500
And just because of that we are connected with our friends.

07:36.500 --> 07:40.500
And then we are taking selfie because we catch the beautiful moments in our camera.

07:40.500 --> 07:45.500
Because if we have that then we can never forget that where we go and where we mistake.

07:45.500 --> 07:51.500
And as you already know that means just because of social media people have less confidence.

07:51.500 --> 07:56.500
Then I would like to tell that in this time there are lots of motivational channel.

07:56.500 --> 08:01.500
And if we see that motivational channel then also we can motivate and also we can get a lot of confidence.

08:01.500 --> 08:02.500
But you know Mr.

08:02.500 --> 08:05.500
You are talking about they can make videos

08:05.500 --> 08:06.500
And share on social media.

08:06.500 --> 08:07.500
But you know Mr.

08:07.500 --> 08:13.500
If all the people means use social media and due to this their eyes means eye problem.

08:13.500 --> 08:14.500
And they will go.

08:14.500 --> 08:17.500
So if we talk about eye problem also.

08:17.500 --> 08:19.500
So if we talk about eye problem on Facebook.

08:19.500 --> 08:22.500
And you also suppose that means people go.

08:22.500 --> 08:23.500
There are lots of cases.

08:23.500 --> 08:24.500
I love accident.

08:24.500 --> 08:26.500
And if we go to miss road then I saw the accident.

08:26.500 --> 08:27.500
Well missed the.

08:27.500 --> 08:28.500
Well missed the.

08:28.500 --> 08:33.500
And if there is lots of people gathered in any place then if that person have any enemies

08:33.500 --> 08:35.500
then he also killed that person.

08:35.500 --> 08:38.500
And in the social media you are safe in your home.

08:38.500 --> 08:39.500
Well Mr.

08:39.500 --> 08:40.500

08:40.500 --> 08:41.500
Firstly listen Mr.

08:41.500 --> 08:42.500

08:42.500 --> 08:46.500
As your Mrs. said that in the social media we are lack confidence.

08:46.500 --> 08:52.500
Then as you already said that 80% or 100% people are using social media.

08:52.500 --> 08:58.500
Then if we give our opinions in that platform then we have we are our confidence increase

08:58.500 --> 09:00.500
because there are lots of people.

09:00.500 --> 09:06.500
And if we say any wrong things then lots of people comment your post that it is wrong

09:06.500 --> 09:07.500
and it is bad.

09:07.500 --> 09:08.500
It is bad.

09:08.500 --> 09:12.500
And if you give better opinion then your confidence will increase.

09:12.500 --> 09:19.500
And if you don't better then also your confidence will decrease because and you do better that

09:19.500 --> 09:20.500
that.

09:20.500 --> 09:22.500
