Checking Sentientism/＂Reductionism is well-named. It reduces what you can do.＂ - Michael Levin - Sentientism 199.txt
 In this conversation with Mike Masserman, we discussed the importance of focusing on constructive goals and elevating humanity rather than solely avoiding mistakes. Mike emphasized the value of painting a desirable future, encouraging people to envision what they want 100 years from now instead of dwelling on negative outcomes. He also shared his views on the value of science fiction for its ability to recognize the salience of sentient beings and the potential they hold, regardless of their differences from us.

Mike's work can be explored through his lab's website at darmike11.org, where you'll find peer-reviewed research. For more speculative ideas, photography, and personal musings that he wouldn't include in scientific papers, you can visit thoughtforms.life. He's also active on Twitter at @darmike11.

The discussion touched on the importance of intelligent, compassionate beings working towards a better future and how science fiction often explores these themes with a sense of intuitive sentientism. Mike also mentioned that he would share some vegan tips with Sam (the interviewer) offline.

Overall, the conversation highlights the need for positive, forward-thinking perspectives in shaping our collective future and the potential of science fiction as a source of inspiration and ethical consideration.
