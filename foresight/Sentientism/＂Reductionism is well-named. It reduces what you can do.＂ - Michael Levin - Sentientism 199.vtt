WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:03.060
The best thing I hope my lab does on their best days,

00:03.060 --> 00:04.860
taking these ideas from deep philosophy

00:04.860 --> 00:06.940
that people have argued about for thousands of years

00:06.940 --> 00:09.420
and bringing them to the bedside, to the clinic.

00:09.420 --> 00:11.100
What you look like and where you come from

00:11.100 --> 00:13.500
simply cannot be the foundation

00:13.500 --> 00:15.420
for how we're going to relate to each other.

00:15.420 --> 00:18.060
But I don't feel in any way diminished by the idea

00:18.060 --> 00:20.820
that there are an infinitude of other minds,

00:20.820 --> 00:24.420
highly diverse minds, endless sentient forms

00:24.420 --> 00:27.180
that are also having experiences that strive

00:27.180 --> 00:29.140
and suffer to various degrees.

00:29.220 --> 00:30.900
I think what we have is essential.

00:30.900 --> 00:33.940
I would like humanity to scale its cognitive capacity

00:33.940 --> 00:35.860
more specifically, not just the intelligence,

00:35.860 --> 00:39.460
but the radius of concern, of care, and of compassion.

00:39.460 --> 00:40.980
I think we need to scale that up.

00:40.980 --> 00:43.140
The amount of emails that I get every day

00:43.140 --> 00:45.980
from people with the most unbelievable examples

00:45.980 --> 00:48.700
of biomedical suffering is just incredible.

00:48.700 --> 00:51.420
So I think it is utter moral cowardice

00:51.420 --> 00:54.060
to focus on what we shouldn't do,

00:54.060 --> 00:56.300
as opposed to our duty now that we have,

00:56.300 --> 00:58.260
for the first time, we have the ability

00:58.260 --> 01:00.820
to actually rationally approach these matters,

01:00.820 --> 01:03.980
to try to guarantee a better embodiment

01:03.980 --> 01:05.420
for sentient beings on Earth.

01:16.300 --> 01:17.980
Cool, well, good morning, Mike.

01:17.980 --> 01:19.100
How are you?

01:19.100 --> 01:19.940
Good morning, excellent.

01:19.940 --> 01:20.780
Thanks for having me.

01:20.780 --> 01:22.780
Yeah, it's wonderful to get the chance to talk to you.

01:22.780 --> 01:24.140
I'm very much an amateur in this field,

01:24.140 --> 01:25.820
but I've admired your work for a long while.

01:25.820 --> 01:29.500
And I can't offer you the size of audiences

01:29.500 --> 01:30.940
you're used to with your TED Talk

01:30.940 --> 01:33.460
and with some of the other interviews you've given,

01:33.460 --> 01:35.380
but I can trade that for quality,

01:35.380 --> 01:37.500
because my audience might be small,

01:37.500 --> 01:39.180
but they're lovely and deeply thoughtful.

01:39.180 --> 01:41.540
So I'm sure they'll appreciate your work

01:41.540 --> 01:43.340
and your thinking, because it's great to have you here.

01:43.340 --> 01:45.660
And I think you're probably, in nearly 200 episodes,

01:45.660 --> 01:48.380
my first full-on biologist,

01:48.380 --> 01:51.740
which is a gap I should have filled long ago,

01:51.740 --> 01:55.540
because there's this sense that maybe the mathematicians

01:55.540 --> 01:57.740
look down on the messiness of science,

01:57.740 --> 01:59.300
and maybe even the physicists look down

01:59.300 --> 02:02.060
on the mess of chemistry, biology.

02:02.060 --> 02:03.540
But I think the hierarchy goes the other way.

02:03.540 --> 02:06.940
I think biology is the harder, more challenging space,

02:06.940 --> 02:09.620
whereas the mathematicians and the physicists

02:09.620 --> 02:12.060
with their spherical cows can abstract

02:12.060 --> 02:13.380
some of the interesting stuff away.

02:13.380 --> 02:15.420
You upped your elbows in it quite often,

02:15.420 --> 02:16.420
so it's great to get the chance

02:16.420 --> 02:19.740
to have a biology-focused conversation.

02:19.740 --> 02:20.580
Well, thank you, yeah.

02:20.580 --> 02:23.700
I mean, biologists have plenty of spherical cows.

02:24.260 --> 02:27.180
A lot of people talk about some of our constructs

02:27.180 --> 02:29.180
as real pathways and things like this,

02:29.180 --> 02:32.940
but of course, these are all imaginary kinds of constructs

02:32.940 --> 02:34.540
that we do our best with.

02:34.540 --> 02:35.580
Yeah, cool.

02:35.580 --> 02:37.260
So this is a series of conversations

02:37.260 --> 02:40.180
about what I think of as the deepest philosophical questions

02:40.180 --> 02:42.340
and also the most important.

02:42.340 --> 02:44.620
And they're questions of what's real,

02:44.620 --> 02:47.060
really more epistemology than ontology.

02:47.060 --> 02:48.740
How should we go about best understanding

02:48.740 --> 02:50.300
this crazy world we all share?

02:50.300 --> 02:52.740
But just as importantly, the questions of ethics

02:52.780 --> 02:54.660
and within that complex field,

02:54.660 --> 02:56.660
the simple question of who gets to count.

02:56.660 --> 02:58.260
Who should we count as another

02:58.260 --> 03:00.620
as we're thinking about how to lead a good life?

03:00.620 --> 03:01.780
And I have an obvious bias

03:01.780 --> 03:03.260
because this sentientism worldview

03:03.260 --> 03:05.180
I'm trying to popularize and develop

03:05.180 --> 03:07.460
is very pluralistic and very broad,

03:07.460 --> 03:09.340
but in a sentence is evidence, reason,

03:09.340 --> 03:11.140
and compassion for sentient beings.

03:11.140 --> 03:12.940
So when we're answering the what's real

03:12.940 --> 03:14.620
and how to understand the universe question,

03:14.620 --> 03:16.140
it suggests a really broad,

03:16.140 --> 03:17.780
humble, naturalistic approach

03:17.780 --> 03:19.580
that uses evidence and reasoning.

03:19.580 --> 03:21.420
And when it comes to the ethical scope question,

03:21.420 --> 03:22.260
the clue is in the name.

03:22.260 --> 03:24.180
It says that all sentient beings,

03:24.180 --> 03:26.540
any being that has the capacity to experience things,

03:26.540 --> 03:28.700
to flourish, to suffer should count

03:28.700 --> 03:31.260
at least to some minimal regard and moral consideration.

03:31.260 --> 03:33.380
I'm talking to people in this series of conversations,

03:33.380 --> 03:35.100
some of whom agree and some of whom don't.

03:35.100 --> 03:37.820
So it'll be interesting to see how you have gone

03:37.820 --> 03:39.340
through your own philosophical journey

03:39.340 --> 03:41.100
and answering those questions where you are now

03:41.100 --> 03:43.780
and how that runs through the work you do today.

03:43.780 --> 03:45.220
But before we get onto those big questions,

03:45.220 --> 03:46.700
how would you best introduce yourself

03:46.700 --> 03:48.580
for those people in my audience

03:48.580 --> 03:50.700
who haven't come across your work so far?

03:50.700 --> 03:51.540
Well, let's see.

03:51.540 --> 03:52.740
So my name is Mike Levin.

03:52.740 --> 03:55.540
I'm a professor at Tufts University.

03:55.540 --> 03:58.060
I run the Allen Discovery Center here at Tufts.

03:58.060 --> 04:02.660
I'm also an affiliate faculty member

04:02.660 --> 04:04.460
at the Bees Institute at Harvard.

04:05.460 --> 04:07.100
I do a number of other things.

04:07.100 --> 04:09.420
I co-direct the ICDO,

04:09.420 --> 04:12.940
the Institute for Computer Design Organisms

04:12.940 --> 04:14.700
with Josh Bongard.

04:14.700 --> 04:16.780
And yeah, that's me.

04:16.780 --> 04:19.020
I study a range of things.

04:19.020 --> 04:20.660
I mean, we'll get into all the details

04:20.660 --> 04:22.860
but in my group here,

04:22.860 --> 04:26.860
we do a combination of biology or biophysics,

04:26.860 --> 04:29.780
mostly computer science and cognitive science

04:29.780 --> 04:31.460
to understand embodied minds.

04:31.460 --> 04:32.500
That's really what we do.

04:32.500 --> 04:33.340
Yeah, that's great.

04:33.340 --> 04:34.180
Thank you.

04:34.180 --> 04:35.020
Yeah, we'll dig in.

04:35.020 --> 04:37.460
So let's start with the first of these big philosophical

04:37.460 --> 04:41.180
questions, the question of what's real and epistemology.

04:41.180 --> 04:42.980
Quite often an interesting way into that space

04:42.980 --> 04:43.820
because it's so broad.

04:43.820 --> 04:46.140
It covers anything we might choose to believe

04:46.140 --> 04:47.060
or have credences in.

04:47.060 --> 04:48.980
But an interesting way in many of my guests

04:49.620 --> 04:51.540
is to talk about their journey with respect to religion

04:51.540 --> 04:53.740
and spirituality and whether they grew up

04:53.740 --> 04:56.220
in a religious spiritual sort of context and household,

04:56.220 --> 04:59.860
whether they held onto those types of beliefs or not,

04:59.860 --> 05:01.260
and how that side of their thinking about

05:01.260 --> 05:03.020
some of the sort of ultimate questions

05:03.020 --> 05:06.340
of the nature of reality might have shifted since.

05:06.340 --> 05:08.020
But so I don't know if you wanna wind the clock back

05:08.020 --> 05:10.140
and sort of tell us your story in that space.

05:10.140 --> 05:12.100
And then we could get into, I guess,

05:12.100 --> 05:15.300
more of the field of science and so.

05:15.300 --> 05:16.780
Yeah, yeah.

05:16.820 --> 05:19.460
My background, I think you could say,

05:19.460 --> 05:22.580
is not religious, but highly spiritual.

05:22.580 --> 05:27.580
So I went for a few years, I went to a Hebrew day school

05:28.260 --> 05:32.420
and my background from that perspective is Jewish

05:32.420 --> 05:37.420
and we studied some thoughts around that whole thing.

05:39.620 --> 05:41.700
And I harassed everybody with questions

05:41.700 --> 05:44.580
about what happens in conjoint twinning

05:44.620 --> 05:47.780
and how souls are supposed to work

05:47.780 --> 05:51.620
and how they solve the problems of the hard problem

05:51.620 --> 05:53.740
of consciousness and all that kind of a thing.

05:53.740 --> 05:57.140
And the answers weren't terribly forthcoming

05:57.140 --> 05:58.460
from that direction.

05:58.460 --> 06:03.460
But in my home, I think it was always very clear

06:03.700 --> 06:06.740
from the time I was very young that we had an emphasis

06:06.740 --> 06:10.180
on inquiry, on asking big questions,

06:10.180 --> 06:13.820
on making sure that whatever we spend energy on

06:13.820 --> 06:17.500
is towards things that matter in an ethical way.

06:17.500 --> 06:20.460
I was always encouraged to find things

06:20.460 --> 06:23.980
that I'm passionate about and to use intellect

06:23.980 --> 06:26.940
and every other tool at my disposal

06:26.940 --> 06:28.180
to sort of get to the bottom of things.

06:28.180 --> 06:31.860
So we had lots of deep conversations

06:31.860 --> 06:33.860
about kind of the big questions

06:33.860 --> 06:36.380
and how they might be addressed.

06:36.380 --> 06:38.060
The question, how do you know,

06:38.060 --> 06:40.620
what figure prominently in my childhood?

06:41.500 --> 06:42.820
So we're always encouraged to think

06:42.820 --> 06:44.100
about those kinds of things.

06:44.100 --> 06:46.420
So that in the way I'm describing that naturalistic

06:46.420 --> 06:48.140
epistemology of using evidence and reason

06:48.140 --> 06:49.140
and sort of thinking things through

06:49.140 --> 06:51.740
and that inquiry was there for quite an early age,

06:51.740 --> 06:54.380
even within a family that sat within a broader

06:54.380 --> 06:58.700
sort of religiously defined community and culture, I guess.

06:58.700 --> 07:02.500
Yeah, yeah, but also to be clear that,

07:04.420 --> 07:08.380
there are many ways of enhancing wisdom

07:08.380 --> 07:09.620
or at least attempting to.

07:09.660 --> 07:13.100
And so rationality is an amazing tool,

07:13.100 --> 07:16.340
but one can also ask questions about its limitations

07:16.340 --> 07:18.820
and what other alternatives might be on offer

07:18.820 --> 07:22.020
and making sure that we understand

07:22.020 --> 07:24.100
but what are the things that we're not seeing?

07:24.100 --> 07:26.540
And it's sort of, there's an old saying that says,

07:26.540 --> 07:28.580
show me the net with which you're fishing

07:28.580 --> 07:30.140
and I'll tell you what you're not going to catch.

07:30.140 --> 07:33.340
I forget who said it, but that's that being,

07:33.340 --> 07:35.980
having that level of skepticism about the approaches

07:35.980 --> 07:37.700
you bring to a problem, whether that be

07:37.780 --> 07:40.740
different kinds of logic or whatever else,

07:40.740 --> 07:42.820
that was always emphasized as well.

07:42.820 --> 07:45.860
Yeah, and that if your choice of evidence

07:45.860 --> 07:48.300
or your choice of methods are too narrow,

07:48.300 --> 07:49.700
that can become its own dogma, as you say,

07:49.700 --> 07:53.460
you've got to be able to question those choices too.

07:53.460 --> 07:55.620
And part of the way I try and counter that

07:55.620 --> 07:57.620
is to talk about evidence and reason

07:57.620 --> 07:59.300
in a very broad sense.

07:59.300 --> 08:00.860
So some people will think of that as being

08:00.860 --> 08:03.020
a narrowly rational or empiric

08:03.020 --> 08:06.180
or even a scientific process that doesn't count as evidence

08:06.740 --> 08:08.620
until you've done a randomized control trial.

08:08.620 --> 08:10.100
And I don't think that in those terms at all,

08:10.100 --> 08:13.580
I think of evidence and reason in a very broad open sense

08:13.580 --> 08:16.060
that can include the experience from our senses,

08:16.060 --> 08:18.660
our subjective experience, you know,

08:18.660 --> 08:19.660
how a weird those might be.

08:19.660 --> 08:21.260
I think those are all types of evidence too.

08:21.260 --> 08:22.460
We can be skeptical of them,

08:22.460 --> 08:25.260
but I think that broad conception of naturalism

08:25.260 --> 08:26.700
is something I'm much more comfortable with

08:26.700 --> 08:29.540
than something that's really narrowly

08:29.540 --> 08:31.980
scientific if you like, which can be,

08:31.980 --> 08:34.740
I think narrow down too, too early.

08:34.740 --> 08:39.220
And how did that sense of inquiry,

08:39.220 --> 08:41.380
but a broad sense of inquiry,

08:41.380 --> 08:44.180
shift your actual beliefs over time?

08:44.180 --> 08:45.940
Even when you're asking the awkward questions,

08:45.940 --> 08:48.940
did you still hold onto some of the supernatural beliefs

08:48.940 --> 08:50.060
anyway?

08:50.060 --> 08:52.700
Have those shifted over time?

08:52.700 --> 08:54.580
So I guess there's probably two linked questions there.

08:54.580 --> 08:56.860
How do you think about the possibility

08:56.860 --> 08:59.740
of some of those supernatural constructs now,

08:59.740 --> 09:01.700
gods and souls and spirits?

09:01.700 --> 09:04.740
And is your sense of those still lead

09:04.740 --> 09:07.300
to this inquiry and a naturalistic approach?

09:07.300 --> 09:09.460
Or do you sort of reserve certain areas of knowledge

09:09.460 --> 09:11.380
for different epistemologies

09:11.380 --> 09:14.340
that might be more faith-based or revelatory?

09:15.180 --> 09:17.580
Yeah, I mean, I think that to me too,

09:17.580 --> 09:20.780
I pretty much, I think I pretty much only have one

09:20.780 --> 09:22.860
supernatural belief, which is that

09:22.860 --> 09:25.420
the universe is understandable in some fashion,

09:25.420 --> 09:28.180
whatever that may mean to be understood

09:28.180 --> 09:31.100
and that we are at least to some extent capable

09:31.100 --> 09:34.540
of resonating with a fundamental principles

09:34.540 --> 09:38.060
that guide its development and therefore knowledge seeking

09:38.060 --> 09:40.260
and things like this are not hopeless.

09:40.260 --> 09:42.940
That I fully admit is a supernatural belief

09:42.940 --> 09:45.660
because that's the kind of thing you can't really get behind.

09:45.660 --> 09:47.540
But once you've taken that on,

09:47.540 --> 09:50.060
then everything else becomes possible.

09:50.060 --> 09:51.380
So I don't think anything,

09:51.380 --> 09:54.220
I can't think of anything that would be truly supernatural

09:54.220 --> 09:57.220
in the sense that it might be completely outside

09:57.220 --> 09:59.220
of current abilities to understand,

09:59.220 --> 10:01.380
maybe beyond current scientific formalisms,

10:01.380 --> 10:04.780
but also perhaps beyond our cognitive capacities.

10:04.780 --> 10:06.900
So all of us are finite beings,

10:06.900 --> 10:08.460
guaranteed there are going to be things

10:08.460 --> 10:10.700
that we are simply not capable of comprehending

10:10.700 --> 10:12.580
as well as we can comprehend other things.

10:12.580 --> 10:15.140
And so beyond that, I don't think anything

10:15.140 --> 10:16.660
is really supernatural.

10:16.660 --> 10:21.660
I think all of us are doing our best in cobbling together

10:23.300 --> 10:27.540
some kind of coherent understanding of the world

10:27.540 --> 10:28.780
and our place in it.

10:28.780 --> 10:31.460
And then the interesting empirical part

10:31.460 --> 10:34.220
is then you get to find out how well it's working for you.

10:34.220 --> 10:36.380
So not just in the narrow scientific sense

10:36.380 --> 10:38.860
of specific paradigms that help you do experiments

10:38.860 --> 10:40.580
and make predictions and things like that,

10:40.580 --> 10:44.100
but the same idea applied to one's life.

10:44.100 --> 10:46.280
And so you have various outlooks

10:46.280 --> 10:48.420
that you might take on various frameworks

10:48.420 --> 10:50.420
and then you have to ask yourself,

10:50.420 --> 10:52.340
so how is this working out?

10:52.340 --> 10:54.980
Is this helping me have a more meaningful life?

10:54.980 --> 10:58.300
Is it helping me be a more ethical person

10:58.300 --> 11:01.220
to have better relationships with others?

11:01.220 --> 11:02.340
Those are the kinds of things

11:02.340 --> 11:04.660
that are not specifically sort of scientific outcomes,

11:04.660 --> 11:06.180
but the process is exactly the same.

11:06.180 --> 11:08.980
You examine your framing and you ask yourself,

11:08.980 --> 11:12.140
are there ways to tune that framing to do better,

11:12.140 --> 11:14.020
to have a better experience with others?

11:14.020 --> 11:14.860
Yeah, thank you.

11:14.860 --> 11:16.740
And I quite like describing this naturalistic approach

11:16.740 --> 11:21.140
as being just an attempt to honestly engage with reality

11:21.140 --> 11:23.020
and an attempt to understand it.

11:23.020 --> 11:24.940
And that understanding will always be partial

11:24.940 --> 11:26.500
and probabilistic and provisional

11:26.500 --> 11:28.500
and uncertain and open to revision.

11:28.500 --> 11:30.980
But I guess that's an interesting way of putting it.

11:30.980 --> 11:33.940
It's not just about, does the evidence start

11:33.940 --> 11:37.380
with my hypothesis, it's also how does the application

11:37.380 --> 11:39.740
of this knowledge or these beliefs actually work

11:39.740 --> 11:41.300
for me in practical terms,

11:41.300 --> 11:43.780
whether they're my life or engineering context.

11:43.780 --> 11:44.940
So yeah, thank you.

11:44.940 --> 11:47.460
Yeah, it became pretty clear early on

11:47.460 --> 11:51.420
that how one looks at data or at life

11:51.420 --> 11:54.780
or at anything else is a very strong determined

11:54.820 --> 11:57.980
of how one is going to interpret everything that happens.

11:57.980 --> 12:02.060
And these kind of frames are, they drive what happens next

12:02.060 --> 12:05.340
and they drive the kinds of things

12:05.340 --> 12:07.420
that become possible for you or impossible.

12:07.420 --> 12:11.380
You know, they determine which things are facilitated

12:11.380 --> 12:13.500
and which things are constrained.

12:13.500 --> 12:17.580
And so that aspect of it being really in control

12:17.580 --> 12:22.380
of how you interpret things, I think is really important.

12:22.380 --> 12:24.060
Yeah, thank you.

12:24.060 --> 12:26.900
And if we narrow down now, I think of, I guess,

12:26.900 --> 12:29.260
the scientific pursuit as being a subset of naturalism,

12:29.260 --> 12:32.620
it's the sort of a formalized way of doing that.

12:32.620 --> 12:36.700
And your focus is in the field of biology.

12:36.700 --> 12:38.420
And it's been, it's fascinating

12:38.420 --> 12:40.820
because I think for most people with their memory

12:40.820 --> 12:42.620
of the sort of high school sense

12:42.620 --> 12:44.940
of what biology is involved in,

12:44.940 --> 12:49.020
you've been taking the field in very different ways,

12:49.020 --> 12:53.060
although some of the different ways have quite old roots too.

12:53.060 --> 12:56.100
How have you come to understand biology as a field,

12:56.100 --> 12:58.500
writ large, and what are the sort of distinctive angles

12:58.500 --> 13:00.300
that you've been trying to develop,

13:00.300 --> 13:02.860
particularly as you think about

13:02.860 --> 13:05.700
one of the introductory comments on your lab's website

13:05.700 --> 13:08.860
talks about this fascination with the fact

13:08.860 --> 13:12.660
that all of us have gone from matter to mind in some sense.

13:12.660 --> 13:16.860
Yeah, I don't really think of myself as a biologist.

13:16.860 --> 13:20.100
I mean, we certainly do biology in my lab,

13:20.140 --> 13:21.460
among other things,

13:21.460 --> 13:26.460
but my fundamental commitment in my career and my life

13:27.260 --> 13:29.940
basically has been to understand embodied mind.

13:29.940 --> 13:33.100
So I've got this mind map that I print out every once a year,

13:33.100 --> 13:35.020
I refresh it and print it out every once in a while

13:35.020 --> 13:36.460
and it hangs in the lab.

13:36.460 --> 13:38.460
And it's about nine feet wide,

13:38.460 --> 13:39.900
this big kind of poster thing.

13:39.900 --> 13:40.860
And in the middle of it,

13:40.860 --> 13:45.380
the root node of this mind map is embodied mind.

13:45.380 --> 13:46.540
That's really what I'm interested in.

13:46.580 --> 13:50.060
I'm interested in cognition, intelligence,

13:50.060 --> 13:54.780
and inner perspective in a wide range of diverse systems,

13:54.780 --> 13:56.980
some of which we would call alive nowadays.

13:56.980 --> 13:58.940
I actually spend very little time

13:58.940 --> 14:00.580
figuring out a definition of life,

14:00.580 --> 14:02.380
although if you want, we can talk about it,

14:02.380 --> 14:04.700
but I don't worry about it too much at all.

14:04.700 --> 14:06.660
I'm interested in the things

14:06.660 --> 14:09.060
that all cognitive agents have in common.

14:09.060 --> 14:10.980
I'm interested in the scaling of mind

14:10.980 --> 14:15.820
from its most sort of primitive and humble examples

14:16.580 --> 14:17.420
in the world,

14:17.420 --> 14:19.420
which I don't think anybody would call alive necessarily,

14:19.420 --> 14:22.260
but I think cognition is broader than life,

14:22.260 --> 14:24.140
broader category than life.

14:24.140 --> 14:26.980
And yeah, and that's what we're interested in now.

14:26.980 --> 14:29.740
Now it just so happens that life is our best example

14:29.740 --> 14:33.140
of so far of how that gets scaled.

14:33.140 --> 14:35.540
So we do a lot of work in our lab

14:35.540 --> 14:38.940
using the phenomenon of molecular networks,

14:38.940 --> 14:41.420
scaling into cells, scaling into tissues,

14:41.420 --> 14:42.820
scaling into organisms,

14:42.820 --> 14:44.820
and beyond as an example

14:44.820 --> 14:47.340
of how to understand collective intelligence,

14:47.340 --> 14:49.460
how to communicate and ethically relate to those

14:49.460 --> 14:51.380
that collective intelligence is,

14:51.380 --> 14:53.780
where do the goals of those collective intelligences come

14:53.780 --> 14:55.260
from and so on.

14:55.260 --> 14:58.220
So biology is an excellent playground

14:58.220 --> 14:59.260
for these kinds of things,

14:59.260 --> 15:02.300
but I actually think the question is bigger than that.

15:02.300 --> 15:03.260
Yeah, thank you.

15:03.260 --> 15:06.220
And the, again, the sort of high school,

15:06.220 --> 15:07.580
and when I talk about it in the third person,

15:07.580 --> 15:10.140
it's really my high school sense of these things,

15:11.140 --> 15:13.820
it does reflect this sense

15:13.820 --> 15:17.180
that there are different scales of reality,

15:17.180 --> 15:19.500
and you're interestingly trying to span them

15:19.500 --> 15:21.780
and work across them and look at some phenomena

15:21.780 --> 15:24.020
that may be scale free in some sense.

15:24.020 --> 15:26.300
But I guess you can start,

15:26.300 --> 15:27.900
you can think about the fundamentals of physics,

15:27.900 --> 15:30.740
whether those are fields or fluctuations

15:30.740 --> 15:32.180
in them represented as particles,

15:32.180 --> 15:35.380
and you can come up through the different layers.

15:35.380 --> 15:36.980
For our purposes, I guess,

15:36.980 --> 15:39.300
where it starts to get useful,

15:39.300 --> 15:41.740
most people would think of life as being the point

15:41.740 --> 15:44.900
where we're getting into the realms

15:44.900 --> 15:46.940
of considering the possibility of mind,

15:46.940 --> 15:50.580
at least there are entities that are separated

15:50.580 --> 15:51.740
from their environment,

15:51.740 --> 15:55.300
that have some sort of evolutionary history

15:55.300 --> 15:58.740
that have some form of drive to live,

15:58.740 --> 16:00.140
but you've hinted there already,

16:00.140 --> 16:02.900
you don't necessarily find the concept of life

16:02.900 --> 16:04.100
that interesting,

16:04.100 --> 16:08.780
but then you can move through simple types of life

16:08.780 --> 16:12.340
in the earlier evolutionary stages,

16:12.340 --> 16:14.420
but also in the degree of complexity as well.

16:14.420 --> 16:17.740
So in our current panoply of living beings,

16:17.740 --> 16:20.980
very simple single-celled organisms,

16:20.980 --> 16:22.580
plants and fungi,

16:22.580 --> 16:25.300
and then it feels intuitively like we take another step

16:25.300 --> 16:27.420
on the cognition path

16:27.420 --> 16:29.980
when we're starting to think about animals as well.

16:29.980 --> 16:33.100
So as we're sort of working across that boundary

16:33.100 --> 16:36.660
from non-life to very simple life

16:36.660 --> 16:39.740
through to plants, fungi, and the simplest animals,

16:40.660 --> 16:45.340
where do you see this idea of cognition emerging?

16:45.340 --> 16:46.620
Where did it come from?

16:46.620 --> 16:48.220
And I guess, what is it?

16:48.220 --> 16:49.380
But as one of the things I find interesting

16:49.380 --> 16:51.220
in at least your public writing

16:51.220 --> 16:52.820
is that sometimes it does feel like

16:52.820 --> 16:54.780
there's a little bit of slippage in the term

16:54.780 --> 16:57.940
because sometimes cognition feels like

16:57.940 --> 17:00.940
something that's more narrowly computational.

17:00.940 --> 17:02.740
You know, it's something that maybe my spreadsheet

17:02.740 --> 17:04.140
on a laptop could be doing,

17:04.140 --> 17:06.380
but sometimes there is an implication of mind

17:06.380 --> 17:09.780
and a subjective perspective

17:09.780 --> 17:11.420
in the way you talk about cognition as well.

17:11.420 --> 17:14.020
So I should ask a better question than that,

17:14.020 --> 17:18.340
but in that sort of space of simpler living organisms,

17:18.340 --> 17:21.260
how does cognition emerge and what do you think of?

17:21.260 --> 17:23.380
It is in its simplest terms.

17:23.380 --> 17:27.060
Yeah, so here's how I think about these things.

17:29.580 --> 17:33.020
All of these cognitive claims, in other words,

17:33.020 --> 17:36.100
where you think something is on the spectrum of cognition,

17:36.340 --> 17:37.820
how much mind and all of that,

17:37.820 --> 17:40.820
I don't think these are terms describing particular systems.

17:40.820 --> 17:42.300
I think these are terms describing

17:42.300 --> 17:44.620
our intended relationship to them.

17:44.620 --> 17:47.860
So I don't think any of this is about the system itself.

17:47.860 --> 17:50.380
It's when you make a cognitive claim about something,

17:50.380 --> 17:53.340
you say this system is at the level of whatever,

17:53.340 --> 17:54.340
which you're really telling me

17:54.340 --> 17:56.740
is an engineering interaction protocol.

17:56.740 --> 17:59.420
You're telling me what your viewpoint on that system is

17:59.420 --> 18:00.820
and that viewpoint is gonna determine

18:00.820 --> 18:02.180
how you interact with it.

18:02.180 --> 18:04.660
So I'll give you a simple example.

18:04.660 --> 18:08.180
People argue all the time about whether humans are machines.

18:08.180 --> 18:09.860
And now this is a long conversation

18:09.860 --> 18:11.020
because you have to define machine,

18:11.020 --> 18:12.180
you have to define human and all that,

18:12.180 --> 18:15.500
but if you have an orthopedic surgeon

18:15.500 --> 18:18.300
who does not believe you are a machine, you're in trouble.

18:18.300 --> 18:20.740
You need to find a different orthopedic surgeon.

18:20.740 --> 18:22.900
If you have a spouse or a psychotherapist

18:22.900 --> 18:25.420
who thinks you're a simple machine, you're also in trouble.

18:25.420 --> 18:29.100
Not a great fit there.

18:29.100 --> 18:31.100
There are plenty of supposed doctors out there

18:31.100 --> 18:33.180
who think you're a fluctuation in the cosmic

18:33.220 --> 18:35.700
on some wide vibrations, so yeah.

18:35.700 --> 18:38.340
Yeah, yeah, I mean, so my framework,

18:38.340 --> 18:40.060
so I'm working on this framework called TAME,

18:40.060 --> 18:42.500
T-A-M-E, Technological Approach to Mind Everywhere.

18:42.500 --> 18:45.020
And one of the main claims of this framework

18:45.020 --> 18:49.260
is that none of these things can be determined

18:49.260 --> 18:50.580
from a philosophical armchair.

18:50.580 --> 18:52.260
You can't just decide what things are,

18:52.260 --> 18:53.420
you have to do experiments.

18:53.420 --> 18:56.220
So if you think you're a quantum fluctuation,

18:56.220 --> 18:58.300
whatever, whatever, that's great.

18:58.300 --> 19:00.900
It's all open, it's a fine hypothesis.

19:00.900 --> 19:02.700
What has it done for you, right?

19:02.700 --> 19:03.860
Like what are the benefits?

19:03.860 --> 19:06.580
And so I think this is the difference

19:06.580 --> 19:09.060
between this kind of pluralistic view that I have

19:09.060 --> 19:11.740
where multiple observers can differ

19:11.740 --> 19:14.500
as to their assessment of any given system.

19:14.500 --> 19:16.180
That's what I believe,

19:16.180 --> 19:18.140
but it doesn't mean that anything goes

19:18.140 --> 19:21.220
because those observers can then compare,

19:21.220 --> 19:23.600
well, how well did that worldview work out for you?

19:23.600 --> 19:25.060
What has that enabled you to do?

19:25.060 --> 19:27.180
What has that enabled you to discover?

19:27.180 --> 19:30.340
How rich are your relationships with the various systems

19:30.340 --> 19:31.980
given the view that you have?

19:32.420 --> 19:34.380
So what you wanna do is you wanna get it right

19:34.380 --> 19:35.500
or at least optimize it.

19:35.500 --> 19:36.860
You don't wanna have false negatives

19:36.860 --> 19:40.500
where you attribute cognitive qualities to systems

19:40.500 --> 19:43.980
that where they don't give you any new purchase.

19:43.980 --> 19:48.980
So for example, kind of old school animist ideas

19:50.100 --> 19:51.740
where there's a spirit in every rock,

19:51.740 --> 19:54.700
it's a fine hypothesis, how has that worked out?

19:54.700 --> 19:55.900
What does that do for you?

19:55.900 --> 19:57.580
You need to do experiments and you need to show that,

19:57.580 --> 19:59.980
hey, by saying that this thing has goals,

19:59.980 --> 20:01.960
it has learning capacity, it has whatever,

20:01.960 --> 20:03.420
this is now what I'm able to do.

20:03.420 --> 20:07.320
I'm able to either make better prediction and control

20:07.320 --> 20:11.360
or we're having a more richer interpersonal experience

20:11.360 --> 20:12.200
or something.

20:12.200 --> 20:15.100
So all of these things need to be empirically testable.

20:15.100 --> 20:20.100
So in this framework, your spreadsheet may or may not

20:20.760 --> 20:24.360
be doing some of the things that are tractable

20:24.360 --> 20:26.520
using the tools of cognitive science,

20:26.520 --> 20:29.080
for a spreadsheet probably not, but you'd be surprised.

20:29.080 --> 20:31.120
The thing about treating these things

20:31.240 --> 20:33.200
as empirical questions, not philosophy,

20:33.200 --> 20:34.880
is that you are often surprised,

20:34.880 --> 20:36.800
which is what is good about science,

20:36.800 --> 20:39.200
is that when you were surprised,

20:39.200 --> 20:41.000
that that's an opportunity to learn.

20:41.000 --> 20:44.480
And so what I think all of these cognitive claims really are

20:44.480 --> 20:48.080
are hypotheses about which set of tools

20:48.080 --> 20:49.040
am I going to apply?

20:49.040 --> 20:51.280
So am I going to apply the tools of physics

20:51.280 --> 20:52.280
and simple engineering?

20:52.280 --> 20:54.760
Am I going to apply the tool of cybernetics

20:54.760 --> 20:56.800
and control theory, the tools of behaviorism

20:56.800 --> 21:01.800
and learning and training and things like that,

21:01.840 --> 21:05.640
or the tools of communication and psychoanalysis

21:05.640 --> 21:07.480
and love and all these other things.

21:07.480 --> 21:10.080
So the thing is that when you treat that

21:10.080 --> 21:12.960
as an empirical question, you get to do experiments

21:12.960 --> 21:13.800
and you get to be surprised.

21:13.800 --> 21:18.640
So for example, we have found that very simple systems

21:18.640 --> 21:21.000
that represent gene regulatory networks,

21:21.000 --> 21:23.260
so just small numbers of chemicals

21:23.260 --> 21:25.000
that turn each other on and off, that's it.

21:25.040 --> 21:30.280
No cell, no indeterminism, no magic,

21:30.280 --> 21:33.040
just differential equations of describing

21:33.040 --> 21:35.360
how genes turn each other on and off.

21:35.360 --> 21:38.080
That system, which most people would assume

21:38.080 --> 21:40.560
is has zero cognition, they would say,

21:40.560 --> 21:43.160
well, that's a very mechanical, it's justice.

21:43.160 --> 21:44.920
As people say, it's just obeying the laws

21:44.920 --> 21:46.640
of physics and chemistry.

21:46.640 --> 21:47.840
That turns out-

21:47.840 --> 21:49.360
There's a lot in that, just.

21:49.360 --> 21:52.560
Yeah, right, I mean, I really hate that framing,

21:52.560 --> 21:54.200
but that's what people often say.

21:54.200 --> 21:56.160
That system by itself is capable

21:56.160 --> 21:57.480
of six different kinds of learning,

21:57.480 --> 21:59.880
including Pavlovian conditioning, just there.

21:59.880 --> 22:01.120
So with nothing else.

22:01.120 --> 22:04.800
We've also done work on sorting algorithms.

22:04.800 --> 22:08.400
So these are extremely simple, deterministic,

22:08.400 --> 22:10.320
fully transparent algorithms that people

22:10.320 --> 22:11.680
in computer science have been studying

22:11.680 --> 22:14.360
for, I don't know, 60 years or longer,

22:14.360 --> 22:15.800
things like bubble sort and so on.

22:15.800 --> 22:19.200
Even those things, when you probe them the right way,

22:19.200 --> 22:21.600
show novel problem-solving capacities

22:21.680 --> 22:25.000
and behaviors that are not in the algorithm themselves.

22:25.000 --> 22:27.880
So what I am taking from all of this

22:27.880 --> 22:30.720
is that we really need a sense of humility

22:30.720 --> 22:32.680
about what things can do

22:32.680 --> 22:36.640
and what kinds of tools are best appropriate for them.

22:36.640 --> 22:37.480
You don't know.

22:37.480 --> 22:38.880
We are not good at guessing.

22:38.880 --> 22:41.480
We think we are, and people assume this all the time,

22:41.480 --> 22:42.640
but we're not good at guessing.

22:42.640 --> 22:44.080
And so we need a mature science.

22:44.080 --> 22:47.160
So this is, if I had to pick one field

22:47.160 --> 22:49.360
that I think I work in, it's diverse intelligence research.

22:49.360 --> 22:50.400
That's what I think we do.

22:50.960 --> 22:52.920
We are trying to develop principle frameworks

22:52.920 --> 22:57.720
for really knowing which kinds of cognitive tools,

22:57.720 --> 22:59.680
which scale of cognitive tools are appropriate

22:59.680 --> 23:01.160
for various systems.

23:01.160 --> 23:04.800
And we're just not very good at guessing

23:04.800 --> 23:05.760
from the beginning.

23:05.760 --> 23:06.600
Yeah, thank you.

23:06.600 --> 23:09.320
And intelligence, I think, again,

23:09.320 --> 23:12.440
you can spend three hours talking about definitions of it,

23:12.440 --> 23:14.200
but I think many people would talk about it

23:14.200 --> 23:17.560
in simple terms as being the capacity to solve problems,

23:17.560 --> 23:19.400
which is something that could be done

23:19.400 --> 23:22.880
without mind and without subjectivity

23:22.880 --> 23:24.360
and without feeling,

23:24.360 --> 23:28.800
whereas cognition or maybe, again,

23:28.800 --> 23:31.440
you're gonna tell me that these distinctions are

23:31.440 --> 23:35.000
maybe not even well posed.

23:35.920 --> 23:38.680
Yeah, so let's break it down a little bit.

23:38.680 --> 23:40.920
So intelligence, I agree with you

23:40.920 --> 23:42.640
that a good definition of intelligence

23:42.640 --> 23:44.080
has to do with problem solving.

23:44.080 --> 23:45.720
Now, I'm not claiming that problem solving

23:45.760 --> 23:48.280
encompasses everything that's interesting about cognition.

23:48.280 --> 23:52.160
There are other things that are not about problem solving,

23:52.160 --> 23:53.920
but problem solving is good

23:53.920 --> 23:55.640
because it's publicly observable.

23:55.640 --> 23:57.760
It's a good scientific thing to study.

23:58.640 --> 24:03.280
And it's about competency in navigating some problem space.

24:03.280 --> 24:05.400
And there are many tools and tricks

24:05.400 --> 24:09.160
that the system can use to navigate that problem space.

24:09.160 --> 24:12.360
Now, the thing about inner perspective is this,

24:12.360 --> 24:15.120
which is, and at this point,

24:15.120 --> 24:17.960
I'm not talking about the hard problem of consciousness.

24:17.960 --> 24:19.600
We can sort of talk about that separately,

24:19.600 --> 24:22.960
but here's the thing about inner perspective.

24:22.960 --> 24:24.080
It's not a binary.

24:24.080 --> 24:26.600
I don't think any of these categories are usefully binary.

24:26.600 --> 24:29.800
What I think is important about inner perspective is this.

24:29.800 --> 24:31.200
For any kind of system,

24:31.200 --> 24:33.440
you want to be able to answer the question,

24:33.440 --> 24:37.160
how important is the system's perspective onto the world

24:37.160 --> 24:38.760
for me to understand what's happening?

24:38.760 --> 24:40.880
So let's make a, let's do, we have a simple example.

24:40.880 --> 24:43.560
I suppose you have a bowling ball on a hilly landscape.

24:43.560 --> 24:44.880
So you've got this energy landscape,

24:44.880 --> 24:47.000
you've got bumps and valleys and you've got a bowling ball.

24:47.000 --> 24:49.400
If you want to know what that bowling ball is going to do,

24:49.400 --> 24:52.320
your view as a third party observer to this

24:52.320 --> 24:53.880
as an external observer,

24:53.880 --> 24:56.720
your view of the landscape tells the whole story.

24:56.720 --> 24:57.600
Okay, there's nothing more.

24:57.600 --> 24:58.720
You don't need anything else.

24:58.720 --> 25:01.760
You will have everything you need to know

25:01.760 --> 25:02.920
to predict what's going to happen

25:02.920 --> 25:05.160
from your external view of the landscape.

25:05.160 --> 25:06.000
By the way-

25:06.000 --> 25:08.040
You don't need to imagine what it's like to be the ball.

25:08.040 --> 25:10.360
Well, that's the next step.

25:10.360 --> 25:12.320
That's the next step, which is that

25:12.320 --> 25:13.520
if you want to now know

25:13.520 --> 25:15.680
what a mouse is going to do on that landscape,

25:15.680 --> 25:17.040
your view of that landscape

25:17.040 --> 25:19.240
isn't really very interesting at all.

25:19.240 --> 25:20.960
The important thing, and it's not predictive of much,

25:20.960 --> 25:23.240
the important thing is the mouse's view of that landscape,

25:23.240 --> 25:26.080
because if it has an internal representation

25:26.080 --> 25:29.720
of the valence of different portions of that landscape,

25:29.720 --> 25:30.920
so rewards and punishments

25:30.920 --> 25:32.120
and which things are important to it

25:32.120 --> 25:33.720
and what attention it's paying and all that,

25:33.720 --> 25:36.960
the inner landscape of the mouse is the actual landscape

25:36.960 --> 25:38.760
that's going to determine what happens next,

25:38.760 --> 25:40.480
not your view of the landscape.

25:40.480 --> 25:43.840
So different kinds of systems

25:43.840 --> 25:46.320
have different degrees of representation

25:46.320 --> 25:47.480
of their outside world.

25:47.480 --> 25:49.720
It's not just brainy, smart animals that do this.

25:49.720 --> 25:52.240
All systems represent the world to some extent.

25:52.240 --> 25:53.680
And the question is how much?

25:53.680 --> 25:56.800
The question is how much do I need to worry about?

25:56.800 --> 25:59.800
And one way to sort of quantify this

25:59.800 --> 26:02.960
is in terms of the size of the cognitive light cone.

26:02.960 --> 26:05.160
So you can sort of ask for any given system,

26:05.160 --> 26:07.480
if you were to draw a space time,

26:07.520 --> 26:09.080
it's sort of a butchering of Minkowski's

26:09.080 --> 26:10.600
space time cone diagrams,

26:10.600 --> 26:13.480
you can draw a little diagram that says,

26:13.480 --> 26:16.400
what are the events both back in time and forward,

26:16.400 --> 26:17.760
because some systems anticipate,

26:17.760 --> 26:20.760
so both back in time and forward in time and spatially,

26:20.760 --> 26:22.200
what are the things you need to know

26:22.200 --> 26:25.800
to have a really rich relationship with the system,

26:25.800 --> 26:27.760
meaning prediction, control,

26:27.760 --> 26:28.920
something that benefits you,

26:28.920 --> 26:32.120
and in some cases, something that's ethical and all that.

26:32.120 --> 26:33.000
What do you need to know?

26:33.000 --> 26:36.120
So for a bowling ball, the cognitive light cone is tiny,

26:36.120 --> 26:37.640
because everything you need to know is right there.

26:37.640 --> 26:39.240
You add up all the pushes and pulls on it,

26:39.240 --> 26:42.000
you're more or less done.

26:42.000 --> 26:45.640
But once you start entering the systems

26:45.640 --> 26:47.240
that are even as simple as a collection

26:47.240 --> 26:49.200
of genes regulating each other,

26:49.200 --> 26:51.080
that's no longer satisfactory,

26:51.080 --> 26:52.920
because they learn from experience

26:52.920 --> 26:54.320
and things that have happened before

26:54.320 --> 26:56.880
are gonna make huge differences to what happens next.

26:56.880 --> 26:59.520
You cannot gain a full understanding of what's happening

26:59.520 --> 27:01.040
or to gain good control

27:01.040 --> 27:02.880
without understanding their inner perspective.

27:02.880 --> 27:07.320
So I think inner perspective is something

27:07.320 --> 27:09.840
that to some degree is wider than biology.

27:09.840 --> 27:11.520
I think what biology is really good at

27:11.520 --> 27:14.400
is scaling up these cognitive light cones.

27:14.400 --> 27:17.440
So in a rock, the cognitive light cone of the pieces,

27:17.440 --> 27:18.920
which by the way is not zero, it's very small,

27:18.920 --> 27:20.280
but I don't think it's zero,

27:21.440 --> 27:24.040
is not really summed up in the rock.

27:24.040 --> 27:25.680
The rock has exactly the same level

27:25.680 --> 27:27.320
of cognitive light cone as its pieces,

27:27.320 --> 27:29.400
but biology is super good.

27:29.400 --> 27:30.240
To say it another way,

27:31.160 --> 27:33.640
we call living things any system

27:33.640 --> 27:35.960
that's good at scaling up the cognitive light cone

27:35.960 --> 27:38.800
of its parts, it's going to look alive to us.

27:38.800 --> 27:40.520
And just the final kind of thing,

27:40.520 --> 27:43.120
which we'll probably get to again later

27:43.120 --> 27:45.760
in terms of what kind of world we want to live in,

27:45.760 --> 27:49.520
I think that evolution has no monopoly

27:49.520 --> 27:51.920
on producing cognition.

27:51.920 --> 27:53.080
In other words, up until now,

27:53.080 --> 27:54.800
yes, that's probably, at least on Earth,

27:54.800 --> 27:56.960
that's probably mostly where cognition came from,

27:56.960 --> 28:00.720
is from the fumblings of mutation of selection

28:00.720 --> 28:02.320
and of some other things.

28:02.320 --> 28:04.520
But I don't think intrinsically,

28:04.520 --> 28:07.040
that's where cognition has to come from.

28:07.040 --> 28:08.760
I don't see any reason whatsoever

28:08.760 --> 28:12.600
why the rational efforts of other cognitive agents,

28:12.600 --> 28:17.160
such as ourselves, couldn't make new minds going forward.

28:17.160 --> 28:18.160
Yeah, thank you.

28:18.160 --> 28:19.560
Yeah, we get to dig into that.

28:19.560 --> 28:23.680
And the point you mentioned about the approach to genetics

28:23.680 --> 28:25.360
is one of the things that you've helped

28:25.760 --> 28:26.960
radicalize this view,

28:26.960 --> 28:30.480
this simplistic view that DNA is some form of blueprint

28:30.480 --> 28:33.280
where you programmatically and linearly follow it.

28:33.280 --> 28:34.600
And that's one of the things

28:34.600 --> 28:37.400
as I understand your work has radically opened up.

28:37.400 --> 28:38.600
It's nowhere near that simple.

28:38.600 --> 28:41.480
It's much more about systems interacting

28:41.480 --> 28:43.880
and memory can be held in different forms and so on.

28:43.880 --> 28:47.720
So yeah, it's broadened out that view.

28:47.720 --> 28:50.320
And as we're sort of moving further up

28:52.040 --> 28:53.960
the scale, if there is such a scale,

28:54.960 --> 28:57.440
one of the things I've heard you resist before

28:57.440 --> 28:59.120
as you are here in a way

29:00.480 --> 29:02.840
is this idea of really clear binary concepts,

29:02.840 --> 29:05.560
concepts like sentience and consciousness

29:05.560 --> 29:10.160
that try to take ideas like cognition

29:10.160 --> 29:15.000
and map them onto this intuitive sense that we have,

29:15.000 --> 29:19.000
that we are ineffable, distinct,

29:19.000 --> 29:22.320
somehow unique entities

29:22.320 --> 29:24.680
that feel like we're separate.

29:24.680 --> 29:25.960
We're not just physics.

29:25.960 --> 29:29.920
And I empathize with that resistance

29:29.920 --> 29:33.480
because I think there's a danger in that intuition

29:33.480 --> 29:37.800
that we reify these ideas

29:37.800 --> 29:40.560
because they're obviously important to us intuitively.

29:40.560 --> 29:42.240
I can understand why anyone's consciousness

29:42.240 --> 29:43.080
will be important to them.

29:43.080 --> 29:44.520
Ultimately, it's all they experience, right?

29:44.520 --> 29:46.360
And everything we experience comes through the consciousness.

29:46.360 --> 29:48.480
But there's a danger in reifying that,

29:48.480 --> 29:50.320
you take it away from just being physics

29:50.320 --> 29:51.920
because ultimately I think I share your view

29:52.680 --> 29:54.480
that just physics,

29:54.480 --> 29:57.560
we are all just part of the natural world all the way down.

29:57.560 --> 29:59.240
That doesn't mean these aren't interesting concepts,

29:59.240 --> 30:02.560
but they're not distinct from physical reality.

30:04.480 --> 30:06.320
But at the same time,

30:06.320 --> 30:09.600
I prefer not to put them completely to one side.

30:09.600 --> 30:13.240
And I think in the way you're describing,

30:13.240 --> 30:16.240
needing some sort of research concept

30:16.240 --> 30:20.840
or some concept of relationality

30:20.880 --> 30:23.680
can still provide at least a couple of reasons

30:23.680 --> 30:26.040
why it's important to still focus on ideas

30:26.040 --> 30:27.600
like sentience and consciousness.

30:27.600 --> 30:28.800
And I guess one,

30:28.800 --> 30:31.320
it came partly through my conversation with Mark Solms,

30:31.320 --> 30:33.080
who I know you spent a lot of quality time with.

30:33.080 --> 30:35.000
I've loved some of your discussions

30:35.000 --> 30:40.000
because part of the way he tells the story about evolution

30:40.040 --> 30:41.600
is that sentience,

30:41.600 --> 30:44.440
the capacity to actually experience a valence

30:44.440 --> 30:46.520
is one of the things that's probably driven

30:46.520 --> 30:50.200
the process of broader cognition

30:50.200 --> 30:52.520
and evolution in the first place.

30:52.520 --> 30:57.200
So he puts that concept or the ability to feel things,

30:57.200 --> 30:59.080
feel good, feel good, bad,

30:59.080 --> 31:02.600
how am I doing now in this environment as quite central?

31:02.600 --> 31:05.280
And I guess that's the way I think of sentience

31:05.280 --> 31:07.240
as being just that capacity to have an experience

31:07.240 --> 31:11.280
and to value it from yourself, whatever yourself is.

31:11.280 --> 31:12.560
But I guess another reason,

31:12.560 --> 31:14.760
another potential research project

31:14.800 --> 31:16.360
links to our next question,

31:16.360 --> 31:18.640
which is that these things also seem to have

31:18.640 --> 31:23.640
some quite deep moral or ethical significance too,

31:23.840 --> 31:26.360
in that, you know, and we'll come back to that.

31:26.360 --> 31:27.720
But I guess those are two of the reasons

31:27.720 --> 31:30.560
why those sometimes problematic concepts,

31:30.560 --> 31:35.200
and I certainly don't think they're binary in any sense.

31:35.200 --> 31:38.760
There's still a drive for us to understand and dig in.

31:40.240 --> 31:41.800
What do you think about those sorts of challenges about,

31:41.800 --> 31:43.560
you know, is there a,

31:43.560 --> 31:45.320
because you could go to a point of view

31:45.320 --> 31:49.320
where you never talk about sentience and consciousness

31:49.320 --> 31:53.320
or subjective experience in those senses at all,

31:53.320 --> 31:56.480
and you stick purely with a more neutral description

31:56.480 --> 32:01.480
of cognition and agent spaces and Markov blanket.

32:02.760 --> 32:07.360
Do you feel that there is some meaningful pull

32:07.360 --> 32:10.200
to delve into and better understand those ideas

32:10.200 --> 32:12.120
of sentience and consciousness in their own right,

32:12.120 --> 32:12.960
or how do you think of this?

32:13.800 --> 32:16.520
Well, I think those are essential.

32:16.520 --> 32:21.520
My resistance to binary categories is not to,

32:21.880 --> 32:25.360
you know, kind of reduce these aspects

32:25.360 --> 32:26.720
that you're talking about at all.

32:26.720 --> 32:29.280
It's to, on the contrary,

32:29.280 --> 32:31.640
it's to have a better understanding of them

32:31.640 --> 32:32.760
and their potential.

32:32.760 --> 32:35.680
You know, I get a lot of pushback from both directions.

32:35.680 --> 32:37.960
So I get mechanistic, you know,

32:37.960 --> 32:41.520
sort of supposedly reductionist scientists who say,

32:41.560 --> 32:42.640
well, this is crazy.

32:42.640 --> 32:46.520
You're painting feelings onto cells

32:46.520 --> 32:50.560
and chemistry is the best kind of explanation.

32:50.560 --> 32:52.000
You know, and that's not really reductionist

32:52.000 --> 32:54.080
because then if you say, well, you mean quantum foam,

32:54.080 --> 32:55.280
you want to talk about quantum foam,

32:55.280 --> 32:56.880
they say, nah, nah, nah, that's not it.

32:56.880 --> 32:58.280
It's chemistry, it's got to be chemistry.

32:58.280 --> 33:01.480
So they've picked the level, okay.

33:01.480 --> 33:05.120
But I also get a lot of flak from the organists,

33:05.120 --> 33:07.320
which, and I consider myself in the organist tradition,

33:07.320 --> 33:10.840
but who say, look, by putting non-living things

33:10.840 --> 33:13.520
on the other side, such as physical objects

33:13.520 --> 33:14.880
and computers and whatnot on that,

33:14.880 --> 33:16.480
somewhere on that spectrum,

33:16.480 --> 33:21.160
you're undermining this battle that we've had

33:21.160 --> 33:24.160
for hundreds of years to preserve the magic

33:24.160 --> 33:27.520
and the importance of life and of inner perspective

33:27.520 --> 33:28.360
and so on.

33:28.360 --> 33:30.040
I don't think understanding these things better

33:30.040 --> 33:33.840
and understanding how they scale up reduces the importance

33:33.840 --> 33:38.840
or the majesty of the obvious sentience of living beings.

33:38.920 --> 33:41.240
I think much like with any kind of science,

33:41.240 --> 33:43.000
it helps us to understand what we are

33:43.000 --> 33:45.560
and what our potential is and what we need to do.

33:45.560 --> 33:49.880
I think that this weird obsession with chemistry

33:49.880 --> 33:54.880
and with physics too is what undermines the efforts

33:55.680 --> 33:56.760
to really understand this.

33:56.760 --> 34:00.560
And I'll give you a simple example, well, two examples.

34:00.560 --> 34:05.360
One is, I often hear people say this,

34:05.400 --> 34:10.040
that's not real goals,

34:10.040 --> 34:14.160
real preferences, real valence, real anything.

34:14.160 --> 34:16.840
That's just, it's just following the laws

34:16.840 --> 34:18.040
of physics and chemistry.

34:18.040 --> 34:18.880
Well, guess what?

34:18.880 --> 34:22.120
If you were to zoom in to your brain

34:22.120 --> 34:24.000
or the rest of your body, guess what you would find?

34:24.000 --> 34:24.840
You wouldn't find fairies,

34:24.840 --> 34:27.160
you would find physics and chemistry.

34:27.160 --> 34:28.000
So it's very-

34:28.000 --> 34:29.040
And even if you found fairies,

34:29.040 --> 34:30.440
they'd be following the laws of physics too.

34:30.440 --> 34:32.640
They would have to be following something, right?

34:32.640 --> 34:36.040
So I'm not against, if you have a model of,

34:36.040 --> 34:37.440
people sometimes email me,

34:37.440 --> 34:38.400
well, what about the soul?

34:38.400 --> 34:39.360
I say, bring it on.

34:39.360 --> 34:42.240
If you've got a model of the soul,

34:42.240 --> 34:45.840
explain how that works and how that solves these problems

34:45.840 --> 34:47.040
and we're good to go.

34:47.040 --> 34:49.000
The problem is, I've never seen such a model,

34:49.000 --> 34:52.240
but the question, I always bring it back

34:52.240 --> 34:55.800
to the paramecium or a single cell.

34:55.800 --> 34:57.920
Do you or do you not believe that that thing has

34:57.920 --> 35:01.720
to some small extent a preference about what happens?

35:01.720 --> 35:06.520
If you do, then we simply point out that,

35:06.520 --> 35:08.560
well, look, it's very clearly made

35:08.560 --> 35:11.120
of a set of interacting chemicals.

35:11.120 --> 35:12.800
At some point we'll be able to reconstitute one.

35:12.800 --> 35:14.280
So what's the issue?

35:14.280 --> 35:16.360
If you don't, then you have to explain to me

35:16.360 --> 35:18.120
what happens in embryonic development,

35:18.120 --> 35:20.360
where you actually go very slowly

35:20.360 --> 35:23.480
and gradually from a single cell

35:23.480 --> 35:25.440
into whatever it is that we are.

35:25.440 --> 35:27.480
And again, there is no magic lightning flash

35:27.480 --> 35:29.840
that converts the chemistry of the oocyte

35:29.880 --> 35:33.120
into the mind of the adult human.

35:33.120 --> 35:35.800
So this continuity, you can't escape it.

35:35.800 --> 35:38.640
What we owe is not a story about magic of bright lines,

35:38.640 --> 35:40.480
we owe a story about scaling.

35:40.480 --> 35:44.440
And the other thing that I think is really curious

35:44.440 --> 35:48.680
and it's kind of, I don't know if it's my bringing

35:48.680 --> 35:50.240
with too much science fiction or what,

35:50.240 --> 35:51.880
but I find it really amazing.

35:51.880 --> 35:53.680
There was a great scene in,

35:53.680 --> 35:56.160
there's a movie called Ex Machina, you know?

35:57.160 --> 35:58.960
And there's a great scene in that movie

35:58.960 --> 36:03.800
where the protagonist is now so confused by this AI

36:03.800 --> 36:04.920
that he's been dealing with it.

36:04.920 --> 36:06.200
He's standing there in front of a mirror

36:06.200 --> 36:08.760
and he starts cutting his hand because his arm,

36:08.760 --> 36:11.320
because he wants to see if he is a robot too, right?

36:11.320 --> 36:12.800
And it's very important to him.

36:12.800 --> 36:17.240
So this is critical to him, it's very stressful.

36:17.240 --> 36:19.840
And I get emails all the time also from people who say,

36:19.840 --> 36:22.200
I've read your paper, I understand now

36:22.200 --> 36:25.160
that I'm a walking bag of cells, now I'm depressed.

36:25.160 --> 36:27.880
I don't know what to do with myself, this is terrible, right?

36:27.880 --> 36:31.280
And let's just unpack this, this cutting your arm thing.

36:31.280 --> 36:35.200
So what that means is, if you were to find,

36:35.200 --> 36:36.360
so you cut open your arm

36:36.360 --> 36:38.240
and you find a bunch of cogs and gears,

36:38.240 --> 36:40.360
you've had, I don't know, 40, 50,

36:40.360 --> 36:43.800
however many years of experience in your own skin,

36:43.800 --> 36:47.800
being an agent, exerting effort towards various outcomes

36:47.800 --> 36:51.040
and having moral quandaries and having, you know,

36:51.040 --> 36:52.720
Qualey and all these things.

36:52.720 --> 36:54.760
And when you see those cogs and gears,

36:54.760 --> 36:58.360
what you're gonna decide is, none of that was real

36:58.360 --> 37:00.560
because I am committed to the idea

37:00.560 --> 37:02.800
that cogs and gears can't support it.

37:02.800 --> 37:04.760
This is so bizarre to me.

37:04.760 --> 37:06.800
And it's bizarre because we don't know

37:06.800 --> 37:08.960
what cogs and gears can and can't support.

37:08.960 --> 37:12.440
You know, why are you so attached to a protoplasm

37:12.440 --> 37:15.280
and proteins and whatever else is inside you

37:15.280 --> 37:17.920
over something else that you might find?

37:17.920 --> 37:19.920
What do you think you know about those things

37:19.920 --> 37:23.200
that overrides your primary experience as a human?

37:23.200 --> 37:25.080
It's just, it's amazing to me

37:25.080 --> 37:28.520
that what people naturally tend to say is,

37:28.520 --> 37:31.480
okay, well, then I guess I'm not real, I'm not important,

37:31.480 --> 37:34.080
I can't do all of the amazing things I was going to do

37:34.080 --> 37:36.320
versus, wow, I guess I just learned something great

37:36.320 --> 37:38.440
about cogs and gears, look at that.

37:38.440 --> 37:40.200
You know, I guess cogs and gears can do it,

37:40.200 --> 37:42.880
not too much more shocking than finding out the proteins

37:42.880 --> 37:45.640
and, you know, and carbohydrates and whatever else

37:45.640 --> 37:47.040
is in our bodies can do it.

37:47.040 --> 37:49.000
Yeah, and neurons firing, it's like.

37:49.000 --> 37:51.880
Yeah, yeah, but people are so committed

37:51.880 --> 37:56.400
to simple, well, to two things, to, first of all,

37:56.400 --> 37:59.720
to the idea that if your parts obey the laws of physics,

37:59.720 --> 38:02.680
then you are somehow reduced, which I think, you know,

38:02.680 --> 38:05.200
this allegiance to a low level of description,

38:05.200 --> 38:06.720
I think it's completely arbitrary.

38:06.720 --> 38:09.000
Dennis Noble does a really nice job in his work

38:09.000 --> 38:13.560
on against privileged levels of causation and things like that.

38:13.560 --> 38:18.080
And then the idea that we know what various kinds

38:18.080 --> 38:20.000
of materials and architectures can do,

38:20.040 --> 38:22.120
we have absolutely no idea.

38:22.120 --> 38:25.440
You know, we need, this actual field is at a,

38:25.440 --> 38:28.920
despite the rest of science is at a very young stage.

38:28.920 --> 38:30.920
We do not know, there are emergent,

38:30.920 --> 38:32.360
not just emergent complexity,

38:32.360 --> 38:34.480
so everybody studies emergent complexity,

38:34.480 --> 38:35.640
that's been around for a long time.

38:35.640 --> 38:37.000
It's not emergent complexity here,

38:37.000 --> 38:40.520
it's emergent goal-directedness and emergent cognition.

38:40.520 --> 38:42.840
And that happens and even in very simple systems,

38:42.840 --> 38:44.520
it surprises us constantly.

38:44.520 --> 38:45.880
We are not good at predicting it,

38:45.880 --> 38:48.200
we are not good at creating it yet.

38:48.200 --> 38:51.400
Well, I should say we may create it unwittingly all the time.

38:51.400 --> 38:53.120
And so people who say, you know,

38:53.120 --> 38:56.080
I know what this is because I made it,

38:56.080 --> 38:58.560
I think that's a really dangerous idea

38:58.560 --> 39:00.880
because you don't know what something is

39:00.880 --> 39:02.880
just because you made it or because,

39:02.880 --> 39:05.040
people say this a bunch of language models or whatever,

39:05.040 --> 39:07.480
just because you know the parts that went into it,

39:07.480 --> 39:09.720
we do not yet know what it is, what it can do

39:09.720 --> 39:11.960
and how important is the inner perspective

39:11.960 --> 39:13.960
and what kind of inner perspective it has.

39:13.960 --> 39:17.960
So yeah, I think a lot of humility here

39:17.960 --> 39:20.920
is needed and a letting go of this idea

39:20.920 --> 39:23.800
that the right level of description is chemistry.

39:23.800 --> 39:26.200
And you know, I think it's fine that that's there,

39:26.200 --> 39:29.360
it does not tell the whole story in any practical way.

39:29.360 --> 39:30.200
Yeah, thank you.

39:30.200 --> 39:32.360
You need to understand that these things run

39:32.360 --> 39:35.840
and operate at different levels and interlocking levels.

39:35.840 --> 39:39.560
Well, just very specifically,

39:39.560 --> 39:43.720
the business of physics and determinism, right?

39:43.720 --> 39:45.600
One of the key issues here is that

39:45.600 --> 39:47.920
determinism is well and good

39:47.920 --> 39:50.920
if what you're interested in doing is looking backwards.

39:50.920 --> 39:52.480
So something has happened

39:52.480 --> 39:54.880
and you're going to tell a mechanistic story

39:54.880 --> 39:55.720
of why it happened.

39:55.720 --> 39:56.640
And then you can always do that,

39:56.640 --> 39:57.480
that's always on the table.

39:57.480 --> 39:59.080
So you zoom down and you say, look,

39:59.080 --> 40:01.760
this person did that because these neurotransmitters

40:01.760 --> 40:03.920
zigged and zagged and they did that

40:03.920 --> 40:06.960
because of the electron forces and all of this stuff, right?

40:06.960 --> 40:09.680
You can always tell a story going backwards.

40:09.680 --> 40:11.240
But that isn't what we're interested in,

40:11.240 --> 40:13.120
both as humans and scientists,

40:13.120 --> 40:14.600
we're interested in going forwards

40:14.600 --> 40:17.080
as in what can and should I do next

40:17.080 --> 40:18.440
and what can I invent

40:18.440 --> 40:21.240
or how can I increase my understanding next?

40:21.240 --> 40:23.320
And that is a completely different kind of task.

40:23.320 --> 40:26.120
So here's one of my favorite examples.

40:26.120 --> 40:29.120
The game of life, cellular automaton, right?

40:29.120 --> 40:32.480
So you've got three simple rules that dictate

40:32.480 --> 40:35.640
how the state of each cell is going to be on or off

40:35.640 --> 40:37.160
based on what its neighbors do.

40:37.160 --> 40:38.000
Okay, so just-

40:38.000 --> 40:39.800
It's a simple two-dimensional grid, isn't it?

40:39.800 --> 40:41.440
Completely simple, yep.

40:41.440 --> 40:43.320
Super simple, two-dimensional grid

40:43.360 --> 40:46.960
the cells are on or off and it's fully deterministic.

40:46.960 --> 40:48.720
Okay, there's not even an ecstasy here.

40:48.720 --> 40:51.200
So every cell in every tick of the clock,

40:51.200 --> 40:53.840
each cell becomes on or off

40:53.840 --> 40:55.240
based on how many neighbors it has.

40:55.240 --> 40:56.080
That's it.

40:56.080 --> 40:58.960
Now, we know, and if anybody in the audience

40:58.960 --> 41:00.520
hasn't seen it, look it up

41:00.520 --> 41:02.920
and you can see these amazing things that happen, right?

41:02.920 --> 41:05.040
So emerging complexity is very strong here.

41:05.040 --> 41:06.200
And if anyone hasn't played with it,

41:06.200 --> 41:08.120
I'd recommend go and find some of the online tools

41:08.120 --> 41:10.160
because you can play with this stuff yourself.

41:10.160 --> 41:11.440
It's mind-blowing, yeah.

41:11.440 --> 41:13.320
Absolutely, absolutely amazing.

41:13.320 --> 41:17.800
And so now, look, you can imagine being a reductionist

41:17.800 --> 41:19.600
determinist about this world and say,

41:19.600 --> 41:21.360
so for example, one of the things that happens

41:21.360 --> 41:23.280
in this world is there are things called gliders.

41:23.280 --> 41:26.200
So gliders are patterns that are a particular shape

41:26.200 --> 41:27.600
and the shape moves across.

41:27.600 --> 41:30.120
Now, to be clear, nothing actually moves across,

41:30.120 --> 41:32.120
the cells are just turning on and off,

41:32.120 --> 41:34.560
but the pattern itself, it's like a wave in the,

41:34.560 --> 41:37.400
the pattern itself moves and those are called gliders.

41:37.400 --> 41:40.280
So now you could be a reductionist about this

41:40.280 --> 41:41.960
and you can say, look, there are no gliders.

41:41.960 --> 41:43.760
All there is are the individual cells

41:43.760 --> 41:45.480
and I can tell you precisely which cells

41:45.480 --> 41:46.640
are gonna come on and off.

41:46.640 --> 41:48.360
And the fact that you think you see gliders

41:48.360 --> 41:50.440
is an epiphenomenon, it does nothing.

41:50.440 --> 41:51.720
In the system, there are no gliders,

41:51.720 --> 41:53.680
all it is is the rules.

41:53.680 --> 41:55.240
And that isn't exactly wrong

41:55.240 --> 41:57.400
because the physics of the world are quite clear,

41:57.400 --> 41:59.680
but it's absolutely limiting in the following way.

41:59.680 --> 42:01.640
If you don't believe in gliders,

42:01.640 --> 42:05.360
you can predict the next state of whatever state

42:05.360 --> 42:06.400
I set up in the game,

42:06.400 --> 42:08.520
you can tell me exactly what's gonna happen next.

42:08.560 --> 42:10.480
There's no escape from that level of determinism.

42:10.480 --> 42:11.600
But here's what you won't ever do.

42:11.600 --> 42:13.360
You won't ever build a Turing machine

42:13.360 --> 42:15.280
made out of gliders as somebody did.

42:15.280 --> 42:17.720
Somebody designed a pattern that does computations

42:17.720 --> 42:19.840
by sending gliders back and forth.

42:19.840 --> 42:21.840
If you don't believe in gliders, you're not gonna do that.

42:21.840 --> 42:24.480
It closes off that level of inventiveness.

42:24.480 --> 42:28.160
So looking, so a key thing about these higher levels

42:28.160 --> 42:29.880
is that they enable you to have a more,

42:29.880 --> 42:33.400
a richer relationship with the system going forward,

42:33.400 --> 42:36.000
not just explain what happens backwards

42:36.000 --> 42:37.640
after somebody's done the interesting work

42:37.680 --> 42:39.360
of preparing a system for you.

42:39.360 --> 42:40.680
Yeah, it's fascinating.

42:40.680 --> 42:42.800
And the idea of a universal Turing machine

42:42.800 --> 42:46.560
is essentially a computer

42:46.560 --> 42:48.840
that can carry out any computation,

42:48.840 --> 42:50.400
given enough time and enough resources.

42:50.400 --> 42:53.320
So, and this is from individual cells,

42:53.320 --> 42:56.600
linking on and off based on a super simple rule set

42:56.600 --> 42:58.040
clicking forward all the time.

42:58.040 --> 43:00.800
And the other, and I don't know if this is right,

43:00.800 --> 43:04.800
but I like the difference between the side of determinism

43:04.800 --> 43:06.080
looking backwards and looking forwards,

43:06.080 --> 43:07.080
because in a sense,

43:07.080 --> 43:10.280
it's the same deterministic mechanism going forwards.

43:10.280 --> 43:12.280
Yeah, but for it to be useful,

43:12.280 --> 43:13.640
we need to actually shortcut

43:13.640 --> 43:17.240
whatever that deterministic computation is going to be

43:17.240 --> 43:19.120
for us to be able to predict.

43:19.120 --> 43:21.520
And to do that, we need to understand patterns

43:21.520 --> 43:22.520
at different levels.

43:22.520 --> 43:24.480
And sometimes we can't do it.

43:24.480 --> 43:27.840
You know, sometimes the thing is computationally irreducible

43:27.840 --> 43:31.480
such that the only way of finding out what's gonna happen

43:31.480 --> 43:32.840
is to let the process run

43:32.840 --> 43:35.160
or to create a simulation that's so perfect.

43:35.160 --> 43:37.360
You basically just duplicated reality, right?

43:37.360 --> 43:41.920
So, so even if it's conceptually deterministic in the future,

43:41.920 --> 43:44.040
that doesn't necessarily help you anticipate

43:44.040 --> 43:46.880
and the idea of these high level concepts,

43:46.880 --> 43:48.400
as you said, give you useful tools

43:48.400 --> 43:51.640
and your relation to these phenomena to, you know,

43:51.640 --> 43:54.280
anticipate maybe the future and understand the past.

43:54.280 --> 43:56.160
Yeah, and control what happens next.

43:56.160 --> 43:58.400
So, so as a simple, and some of these systems,

43:58.400 --> 43:59.880
the cool thing about living

43:59.880 --> 44:02.960
and other kinds of systems of this type

44:03.000 --> 44:05.240
is that they offer this kind of shortcut.

44:05.240 --> 44:06.680
So, so here's a simple example.

44:06.680 --> 44:08.160
Imagine that you had a rat,

44:08.160 --> 44:10.520
then you wanted him to do a simple circus trick.

44:10.520 --> 44:12.640
You know, I don't know, sit on a little bicycle or something.

44:12.640 --> 44:13.960
One thing that you might do

44:13.960 --> 44:16.240
from the level of chemistry and physics is you might say,

44:16.240 --> 44:19.040
okay, so I want the muscles to move in this particular way.

44:19.040 --> 44:21.040
I need to calculate which neuronal impulses

44:21.040 --> 44:23.040
are gonna move exactly these muscles to do it.

44:23.040 --> 44:25.380
I need to trace it back into the brain, figure out

44:25.380 --> 44:27.960
all the circuits, how, how everything is gonna

44:27.960 --> 44:29.400
propagate through the brain and figure out

44:29.400 --> 44:31.560
which pixels on the retina I need to stimulate

44:31.560 --> 44:34.080
with various images, you know, shown to the rat

44:34.080 --> 44:35.480
to get him to get on the little bicycle.

44:35.480 --> 44:37.720
Okay, if you try to actually calculate,

44:37.720 --> 44:40.000
so that's completely computationally intractable.

44:40.000 --> 44:42.240
If you try to do that, the sun will burn out

44:42.240 --> 44:44.360
long before you actually get it done.

44:44.360 --> 44:46.400
But there's an amazing thing here,

44:46.400 --> 44:48.600
which is that you can just train the rat.

44:48.600 --> 44:50.960
And that's because the rat has a particular

44:50.960 --> 44:54.160
cognitive causal architecture that hides all that stuff.

44:54.160 --> 44:56.560
And it takes on all the complexity of figuring out

44:56.560 --> 45:00.960
how should my internal parts be arranged

45:01.000 --> 45:02.240
in order for meaning,

45:02.240 --> 45:03.560
meaning all the different neurotransmitters

45:03.560 --> 45:05.640
and everything else, how should that all be arranged

45:05.640 --> 45:07.560
in order to achieve a particular goal?

45:07.560 --> 45:10.840
So the way you do this is you get the buy-in of the rat.

45:10.840 --> 45:12.720
You make your goal, the rat's goal,

45:12.720 --> 45:15.400
and then the rat does all the hard work for you.

45:15.400 --> 45:17.780
You don't have to calculate all this stuff forward.

45:17.780 --> 45:21.240
So one of the things that understanding these,

45:21.240 --> 45:24.280
the large scale capabilities of your system

45:24.280 --> 45:28.040
is critical in having a productive interaction,

45:28.160 --> 45:31.120
a predictive, powerful productive interaction going forward.

45:31.120 --> 45:33.160
And this is something that I think is the rate limiting

45:33.160 --> 45:36.000
step right now for regenerative medicine.

45:36.000 --> 45:39.760
Because in biology and biomedicine,

45:39.760 --> 45:42.000
the standard operating assumption is that cells

45:42.000 --> 45:43.240
are mechanical agents.

45:43.240 --> 45:45.040
All the excitement is about the hardware.

45:45.040 --> 45:49.240
So CRISPR, genomic editing, pathway rewiring,

45:49.240 --> 45:51.460
everything is down at the level of hardware.

45:51.460 --> 45:54.920
And that closes off a huge number

45:54.920 --> 45:57.800
of potentially really powerful interventions

45:58.400 --> 46:01.240
which we're doing in our lab like cellular training,

46:02.320 --> 46:04.360
exploiting cellular problem solving,

46:04.360 --> 46:07.520
because if you insist on viewing systems

46:07.520 --> 46:10.040
from that low level perspective, not that it's wrong,

46:10.040 --> 46:11.400
it's, I mean, that perspective is there.

46:11.400 --> 46:14.000
It's there for you to take, but it limits you.

46:14.000 --> 46:15.560
Reductionism is well-named.

46:15.560 --> 46:17.720
It reduces what you can do.

46:17.720 --> 46:21.640
It reduces your ability to really exploit

46:21.640 --> 46:24.480
what's powerful about these systems.

46:24.480 --> 46:26.640
And we are leaving so much on the table

46:26.640 --> 46:30.320
by refusing to test out the tools,

46:30.320 --> 46:31.960
the interaction tools that we have

46:31.960 --> 46:34.080
and that have been used for,

46:34.080 --> 46:36.200
this is why humans train to dogs and horses

46:36.200 --> 46:38.760
for thousands of years knowing zero neuroscience.

46:38.760 --> 46:43.040
It's because these systems make it accessible,

46:43.040 --> 46:47.080
make that whole process, the goal rewriting process

46:47.080 --> 46:48.840
so accessibly offered a beautiful interface,

46:48.840 --> 46:50.000
that learning interface.

46:50.000 --> 46:51.720
So cells and tissues do this too.

46:51.720 --> 46:54.560
And if you refuse to test those hypotheses,

46:54.560 --> 46:56.320
you leave a lot on the table.

46:56.320 --> 46:57.240
Yeah, thank you.

46:57.240 --> 47:01.200
So these ideas of sentience and consciousness

47:01.200 --> 47:04.400
are very important to you still.

47:04.400 --> 47:05.880
They're not things you discard,

47:05.880 --> 47:08.120
but you refuse to say they're binary,

47:08.120 --> 47:10.080
they're on or off switches.

47:10.080 --> 47:11.600
If there are boundaries, they're fuzzy

47:11.600 --> 47:14.120
and in your sense, there may not even be a boundary at all.

47:14.120 --> 47:17.120
Ultimately, it may just be a question of degree

47:17.120 --> 47:19.680
across every possible system,

47:19.680 --> 47:22.520
but that doesn't destroy their meaningfulness

47:22.520 --> 47:25.160
because there's a sense, I think,

47:25.160 --> 47:27.840
with some people who have a very expansive view

47:27.840 --> 47:31.720
of consciousness that they either reify it in some sense.

47:31.720 --> 47:34.040
Again, they pull away from the physical

47:34.040 --> 47:37.160
and that can lead people into, again,

47:37.160 --> 47:40.080
back into some sort of mystical or soul-based ways

47:40.080 --> 47:41.160
of thinking about it.

47:41.160 --> 47:44.280
Or they declare it universal,

47:45.240 --> 47:46.840
as some might say, you would,

47:46.840 --> 47:48.760
because you're saying, well, it's a spectrum

47:48.760 --> 47:50.280
and there's no real end to the spectrum.

47:50.280 --> 47:52.200
So in a sense, maybe everything shares

47:52.200 --> 47:55.240
in these characteristics to some degree,

47:55.240 --> 47:56.720
but by declaring it universal,

47:56.720 --> 48:00.040
they almost destroy what's meaningful about the concept.

48:00.040 --> 48:00.880
Yeah.

48:00.880 --> 48:02.440
And it sort of flattens out.

48:02.440 --> 48:03.640
And I don't think you're doing either

48:03.640 --> 48:05.240
because you're recognizing that

48:05.240 --> 48:06.680
while you don't want it to make it binary,

48:06.680 --> 48:07.880
there's still something distinctive

48:07.880 --> 48:10.240
that you can describe in terms

48:10.240 --> 48:13.160
of how we relate to these entities

48:13.160 --> 48:18.160
and what these concepts can help us understand

48:18.160 --> 48:21.000
about these entities, so it retains their meaning.

48:21.000 --> 48:24.280
Yeah, it doesn't just, it's not just for explaining,

48:24.280 --> 48:27.880
it is essential and useful.

48:27.880 --> 48:32.440
My claim is that ideas about cognitive capacities

48:32.440 --> 48:35.800
and unfamiliar contexts and unfamiliar embodiments

48:35.800 --> 48:38.720
are essential, they're practical and they're essential.

48:38.720 --> 48:41.880
This is not philosophy,

48:41.880 --> 48:45.120
it's not some kind of feel-good mysticism.

48:45.120 --> 48:47.720
My claim is, and it's a testable claim

48:47.720 --> 48:50.600
that we've been testing for now for 20 years successfully,

48:51.600 --> 48:55.720
is that it helps you do better in the empirical world.

48:55.720 --> 48:59.400
I mean, the best thing I hope my lab does

48:59.400 --> 49:02.560
is what I hope on their best day,

49:02.560 --> 49:04.320
what I think we're doing is taking these ideas

49:04.320 --> 49:05.920
from deep philosophy that people have argued

49:05.920 --> 49:07.280
about for thousands of years

49:07.280 --> 49:09.680
and bringing them to the bedside, to the clinic.

49:09.680 --> 49:13.760
And these things, these ideas are empirically essential

49:13.760 --> 49:15.760
to get the kind of outcomes that you want.

49:15.760 --> 49:19.600
So that's, I don't know what more we can say about

49:19.600 --> 49:21.320
why these ideas are real,

49:21.320 --> 49:23.280
because by taking that inner perspective,

49:23.280 --> 49:25.560
by asking what do cells remember?

49:25.560 --> 49:26.680
What do they care about?

49:26.680 --> 49:28.760
What is their, the size of their goals?

49:28.760 --> 49:30.000
What are their goals?

49:30.000 --> 49:33.160
These are questions that lead directly to therapeutics.

49:33.160 --> 49:35.720
They lead to work in regenerative medicine, in cancer.

49:36.600 --> 49:38.800
I don't know what more evidence we could have

49:38.800 --> 49:40.320
that these things are critical.

49:40.320 --> 49:43.720
And the other issue is that this idea

49:43.720 --> 49:47.640
that if we start to apply the tools

49:47.640 --> 49:49.440
that we use with cognitive systems,

49:49.440 --> 49:51.160
we try to apply them elsewhere,

49:51.160 --> 49:54.720
that that kind of leads to some sort of sliding creep

49:54.720 --> 49:59.720
that devalues our own cognition and our own majesty.

50:01.320 --> 50:05.800
That's a weird zero-sum game that I don't buy into.

50:05.800 --> 50:09.360
I am in no way diminished by, I don't feel in any way

50:09.360 --> 50:13.520
diminished by the idea that there are basically

50:13.520 --> 50:16.760
an infinitude of other minds, highly diverse minds,

50:16.760 --> 50:19.520
endless sentient forms throughout the universe,

50:19.520 --> 50:22.640
and I think I'm certainly here on earth,

50:22.640 --> 50:26.560
that are also having experiences that strive and suffer

50:26.560 --> 50:28.680
and to various degrees.

50:28.680 --> 50:30.440
I don't think that diminishes us at all.

50:30.440 --> 50:35.440
It seems childish to me to somehow pin our,

50:36.000 --> 50:38.080
the quality of what we have on the fact

50:38.080 --> 50:39.960
that no one else has it, that just seems,

50:39.960 --> 50:41.760
I don't know why we need to make that move.

50:41.760 --> 50:44.520
I think what we have is essential.

50:44.520 --> 50:46.000
I think understanding it is essential

50:46.040 --> 50:47.640
so that we can scale it up.

50:47.640 --> 50:49.800
I would like to scale my cognitive capacity.

50:49.800 --> 50:52.720
I would like humanity to scale its cognitive capacity

50:52.720 --> 50:54.640
more specifically, not just the intelligence,

50:54.640 --> 50:59.640
but the radius of concern, of care, and of compassion.

51:00.440 --> 51:01.600
I think we need to scale that up,

51:01.600 --> 51:02.840
and you only do that if you understand

51:02.840 --> 51:04.360
what it is that you're scaling.

51:04.360 --> 51:05.600
You've done the perfect segue

51:05.600 --> 51:07.960
into our second question about the ethics.

51:07.960 --> 51:10.200
And what I might do is collapse these questions

51:10.200 --> 51:13.320
of what matters and who matters just into one,

51:13.320 --> 51:15.920
because in the big questions of ethics,

51:15.920 --> 51:18.120
in a sense, there are a bunch of different choices.

51:18.120 --> 51:19.720
You could take a nihilist route

51:19.720 --> 51:21.320
where you sort of give up on the idea.

51:21.320 --> 51:23.120
You could take a relativist approach

51:23.120 --> 51:27.040
where you think about ethics as just sets of rules

51:27.040 --> 51:29.000
that groups have negotiated

51:29.000 --> 51:31.280
in a more transactional relational sense,

51:31.280 --> 51:34.240
but there's no real truth of the matter

51:34.240 --> 51:38.120
about whether those rules do good or bad.

51:38.120 --> 51:39.880
You could follow a divine command theory,

51:39.880 --> 51:41.440
going back to our early conversation

51:41.440 --> 51:44.040
where you could turn to the Bible or the Quran

51:44.080 --> 51:46.400
or some other source of supernatural authority

51:46.400 --> 51:48.480
and go basically following those rules

51:48.480 --> 51:50.880
or being obedient to that deity

51:50.880 --> 51:53.920
is the ultimate arbiter of what's good or bad.

51:53.920 --> 51:55.000
But if we put those aside,

51:55.000 --> 51:57.000
and personally, I think we should,

51:57.000 --> 52:01.000
whatever sort of moral philosophy we have,

52:02.640 --> 52:05.360
whether it's about rights and day ontology

52:05.360 --> 52:08.120
or whether it's about consequences and utilitarianism,

52:08.120 --> 52:09.920
whether it's about feminist care ethic

52:09.920 --> 52:11.800
where we have relations of care,

52:11.800 --> 52:13.600
whether it's about virtues,

52:13.600 --> 52:15.880
whatever the system is,

52:15.880 --> 52:20.440
they do all seem to share a sort of common sense ethical call,

52:20.440 --> 52:23.040
which is that somehow morality is about

52:23.040 --> 52:25.240
whether and how we care about others.

52:26.920 --> 52:28.400
And the obvious question then is,

52:28.400 --> 52:30.280
okay, well, who gets to count as another?

52:30.280 --> 52:33.440
That's really our who matters question.

52:33.440 --> 52:36.480
And again, I and this podcast have a bias

52:36.480 --> 52:37.880
because we tend to focus on this idea

52:37.880 --> 52:40.240
of sentience as being the qualifier

52:40.240 --> 52:45.240
in that for an entity to count as another,

52:45.280 --> 52:48.760
they need to have their own perspective

52:48.760 --> 52:51.880
within which they value their own experiences,

52:51.880 --> 52:56.000
states, interests, and lives, I guess.

52:56.000 --> 52:59.280
And because they value those things themselves,

52:59.280 --> 53:03.000
that's the rationale for us also caring about them.

53:03.000 --> 53:03.840
Because in a way,

53:03.840 --> 53:06.280
if morality is about caring about others,

53:06.280 --> 53:08.600
let's care about all of the others

53:08.640 --> 53:11.000
that have their own perspective and so qualify as others.

53:11.000 --> 53:12.840
So it's almost a little bit secular.

53:12.840 --> 53:15.360
But anyway, that's I guess the starting point

53:15.360 --> 53:17.160
from this centio-centric ethic

53:17.160 --> 53:19.040
is to care about all of those others.

53:19.040 --> 53:21.600
But I'd be really interested in your own

53:21.600 --> 53:24.400
thinking about either the sort of foundations of ethics

53:24.400 --> 53:26.560
when you're right, wrong, and good, and bad,

53:26.560 --> 53:29.800
but also given what we've talked about so far,

53:29.800 --> 53:33.120
how you think about moral scope and who gets to count

53:33.120 --> 53:34.440
and what are the implications of that

53:34.440 --> 53:37.840
and what journey have you gone on through your life so far

53:37.880 --> 53:40.480
and thinking about those big questions?

53:40.480 --> 53:44.680
Yeah, well, you know, it's somewhat beyond my pay grade

53:44.680 --> 53:48.040
to try to lay out a global theory of ethics

53:48.040 --> 53:49.200
for everybody else and so on.

53:49.200 --> 53:50.560
That's, I won't try to do that,

53:50.560 --> 53:52.280
but I will give you some thoughts

53:52.280 --> 53:54.560
and how I think about these things.

53:55.420 --> 53:56.260
Couple of things.

53:56.260 --> 54:00.040
First, I think it's important to not pretend

54:00.040 --> 54:03.980
that once we understand how sentient something is,

54:03.980 --> 54:06.680
we are automatically good at treating it ethically.

54:06.720 --> 54:08.240
Okay, so we know that's not the case.

54:08.240 --> 54:12.920
We know factory farming, we all know pigs are,

54:12.920 --> 54:16.200
pigs value their experience that they feel pain,

54:16.200 --> 54:17.640
all that, and yet here we are.

54:17.640 --> 54:21.920
So I think what we know and how we treat them

54:21.920 --> 54:24.200
are not unfortunately the same thing,

54:24.200 --> 54:28.480
but certainly we should have a principled way

54:28.480 --> 54:32.120
of apportioning our relationships

54:32.120 --> 54:35.600
with other beings of all different kinds.

54:35.640 --> 54:40.640
I think that moving forward in assuming we all survive

54:42.960 --> 54:45.480
the next few decades, I think moving forward

54:45.480 --> 54:48.120
for the flourishing of humanity, of ecosystems,

54:48.120 --> 54:51.720
of other beings on earth really requires

54:51.720 --> 54:53.560
the deep lessons of diverse intelligence.

54:53.560 --> 54:55.680
I think we need to understand

54:55.680 --> 54:59.440
that there is no such thing as a magical standard human

54:59.440 --> 55:03.160
that is the subject of all these philosophical arguments.

55:03.320 --> 55:06.200
First of all, because evolutionarily,

55:06.200 --> 55:08.280
we have a lineage going back to single cells.

55:08.280 --> 55:12.560
So anything that you think about human responsibilities,

55:12.560 --> 55:15.480
whatever, well, how about a human of 200,000 years ago?

55:15.480 --> 55:17.080
How about 500,000 years ago?

55:17.080 --> 55:18.680
Where was it?

55:18.680 --> 55:19.800
How did it get here?

55:19.800 --> 55:20.720
And so on.

55:20.720 --> 55:23.600
So all of those things are continual.

55:23.600 --> 55:25.720
The same thing is true of embryonic development.

55:25.720 --> 55:28.560
You can ask how these things showed up in your journey

55:28.560 --> 55:30.880
from an OSI to a being.

55:30.920 --> 55:35.680
And all of the current discussions

55:35.680 --> 55:40.680
of neuroatypical humans and the bodily modifications

55:40.680 --> 55:45.000
that some people do, these things are going to be laughable

55:45.000 --> 55:47.880
to the humans of the next couple of generations

55:47.880 --> 55:52.680
in their minor sort of degree, their timid degree.

55:52.680 --> 55:54.400
I mean, you're going to have humans

55:54.400 --> 55:57.960
that are so modified in body and mind, cyborgs,

55:58.640 --> 56:02.280
with various biological and technological changes

56:02.280 --> 56:05.440
that it's going to be completely obvious.

56:05.440 --> 56:07.640
Right now, we're kind of lulled into a fault.

56:07.640 --> 56:10.080
Well, we have been for centuries,

56:10.080 --> 56:11.720
lulled into a false sense of security

56:11.720 --> 56:13.280
in the sense that it was easy.

56:13.280 --> 56:15.440
Before you could say, does it speak?

56:15.440 --> 56:17.440
If it speaks, then it's like us.

56:17.440 --> 56:19.280
And even that humanity fails.

56:19.280 --> 56:21.680
We were really terrible to each other

56:21.680 --> 56:23.720
for much smaller differences.

56:23.720 --> 56:26.960
But you could say, where did you come from?

56:26.960 --> 56:29.520
Meaning, were you evolved or did you come from a factory?

56:29.520 --> 56:30.880
And you could sort of knock on something.

56:30.880 --> 56:32.640
And if you hear a metallic clanging sound, you say,

56:32.640 --> 56:35.040
okay, we know how we're going to deal with this.

56:35.040 --> 56:38.840
And if you heard some kind of soft and kind of a thud,

56:38.840 --> 56:40.400
then that's something else.

56:40.400 --> 56:41.960
Those categories were never any good,

56:41.960 --> 56:44.920
but they served us kind of okay for a long time.

56:44.920 --> 56:45.760
Those are gone.

56:45.760 --> 56:47.360
Those are gone now.

56:47.360 --> 56:48.960
They're going to be left in the dust

56:48.960 --> 56:50.880
by the next couple of decades.

56:50.880 --> 56:53.040
It's going to be essential that we learn

56:53.040 --> 56:55.960
to have an ethical, I call it synthbiosis,

56:55.960 --> 56:58.760
with other beings that are nowhere with us

56:58.760 --> 56:59.600
on the tree of life.

56:59.600 --> 57:01.600
They are modified in body and mind.

57:01.600 --> 57:03.960
And what you look like and where you come from

57:03.960 --> 57:06.320
simply cannot be the foundation

57:06.320 --> 57:08.200
for how we're going to relate to each other.

57:08.200 --> 57:11.760
And again, science fiction dealt with this a long time ago.

57:11.760 --> 57:16.760
But somehow people today have lost sight of some of those

57:16.760 --> 57:20.160
things, again, the current debates over AI,

57:20.160 --> 57:22.240
it's very easy to say that language models

57:22.240 --> 57:23.240
aren't this and aren't that.

57:23.240 --> 57:25.480
And I'm not a defender of any particular view

57:25.480 --> 57:27.240
of sentience and language models,

57:27.240 --> 57:29.000
although more generally, I don't believe

57:29.000 --> 57:30.760
we really know what we have once we've made it.

57:30.760 --> 57:33.640
But the thing is those kind of language models,

57:33.640 --> 57:35.880
they're so different from us that it's very easy

57:35.880 --> 57:38.720
for people to say, oh, that's not the things

57:38.720 --> 57:39.760
we want to care about.

57:39.760 --> 57:41.560
What are you going to do when you're confronted

57:41.560 --> 57:45.680
with humans that have 51% of their brain replaced

57:45.680 --> 57:50.600
by various silicon appliances and they're linked together

57:50.600 --> 57:53.480
with other people and also a few AIs

57:53.480 --> 57:54.640
and some things like that.

57:54.680 --> 57:59.480
So all of this is coming, we are going to have

57:59.480 --> 58:03.160
to develop a better, better more principled

58:03.160 --> 58:06.360
ethical frameworks for dealing with beings

58:06.360 --> 58:09.920
that are just very alien in their construction.

58:09.920 --> 58:12.000
And so that means that you need frameworks

58:12.000 --> 58:15.160
to understand what do all these beings have in common?

58:15.160 --> 58:17.240
And this is something that a few years ago,

58:17.240 --> 58:19.800
I developed this notion of a cognitive light cone

58:19.800 --> 58:23.760
to try to get away from the idea of what kind

58:23.800 --> 58:27.240
of material embodiment you're in and instead focus on

58:27.240 --> 58:28.600
what are the things you care about?

58:28.600 --> 58:33.600
What is the size of the biggest goals you can pursue?

58:34.760 --> 58:36.600
And regardless of your embodiment

58:36.600 --> 58:38.680
or implementation or origin story.

58:38.680 --> 58:42.920
And that kind of a thing at least begins to give us

58:42.920 --> 58:47.680
a way to apportion our degree of moral concern

58:47.680 --> 58:51.880
to beings that are capable of pursuing goals

58:52.520 --> 58:56.320
and having various kinds of competencies

58:56.320 --> 58:59.200
of navigating problem spaces and suffering

58:59.200 --> 59:03.440
when those goals are not reached.

59:03.440 --> 59:08.440
So for that reason, I think the diversity

59:10.680 --> 59:14.080
of who and what we think counts is gonna be enormous

59:14.080 --> 59:16.680
and this business of language models and so on,

59:16.680 --> 59:20.000
it's a distraction from a much deeper puzzle.

59:20.040 --> 59:20.960
Yeah, thank you.

59:20.960 --> 59:23.520
And one of my previous guests, Josh Gellis

59:23.520 --> 59:25.720
has done quite a lot of work in that space

59:25.720 --> 59:29.000
about thinking about potential artificial intelligences

59:29.000 --> 59:30.440
and sentience and so on.

59:30.440 --> 59:31.840
And actually he's quite challenging

59:31.840 --> 59:33.360
about the idea of sentience

59:33.360 --> 59:35.840
because he's worried it's seen too much

59:35.840 --> 59:39.000
as a sort of easily isolatable property

59:39.000 --> 59:41.640
that we will then deny to, for example,

59:41.640 --> 59:43.440
artificial intelligence and robots and so on.

59:43.440 --> 59:46.040
And he prefers a much more relational approach,

59:46.040 --> 59:48.640
which we can go back and forth about the risks

59:48.640 --> 59:49.880
and the challenges of that.

59:49.880 --> 59:52.440
But one thing I do agree with him and I think you

59:52.440 --> 59:55.360
is that we're gonna be forced into working this stuff out

59:55.360 --> 59:56.600
whether we like it or not.

59:56.600 --> 59:58.760
And I think it will open up and radicalize

59:58.760 --> 01:00:00.560
the way we think about what it is to be another

01:00:00.560 --> 01:00:04.440
and that need to appreciate radically different perspective

01:00:04.440 --> 01:00:05.560
from different beings.

01:00:05.560 --> 01:00:08.960
But I was really glad you mentioned animal agriculture

01:00:08.960 --> 01:00:11.200
because one of the frustrations with many people

01:00:11.200 --> 01:00:14.440
who are involved in sentientism or the worldview

01:00:14.440 --> 01:00:17.760
is that there's a frustration in the current zeitgeist

01:00:17.760 --> 01:00:19.840
that people seem really excited about talking

01:00:19.840 --> 01:00:22.960
about artificial intelligences and artificial sentience

01:00:22.960 --> 01:00:24.920
and whether robots could ever feel something

01:00:24.920 --> 01:00:26.280
and become moral patients.

01:00:26.280 --> 01:00:29.440
But people seem to conveniently skip over the hundreds

01:00:29.440 --> 01:00:32.280
of billions, if not trillions, if we include aquatic,

01:00:32.280 --> 01:00:35.200
non-human sentient beings that we brutally exploit today.

01:00:35.200 --> 01:00:37.480
And it's a really interesting case study

01:00:37.480 --> 01:00:42.480
because I think when you take a naturalistic epistemology

01:00:43.440 --> 01:00:45.960
and you understand the facts of what farming

01:00:45.960 --> 01:00:47.880
and fishing are like, not just factory farming,

01:00:47.880 --> 01:00:50.720
but all of it, and you take the ethical perspective

01:00:50.720 --> 01:00:53.320
of the beings that are going through those processes,

01:00:53.320 --> 01:00:57.880
it quite easily leads you to a point of quite extreme ethical

01:00:57.880 --> 01:01:00.920
condemnation of what's going on in those situations.

01:01:00.920 --> 01:01:05.000
But our society is trained us to think this so normal

01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:08.640
that there's a brutal clash between, you know,

01:01:08.640 --> 01:01:11.200
if you like the epistemology and the centiocentric ethic

01:01:11.200 --> 01:01:13.240
and today's social norms.

01:01:13.800 --> 01:01:16.200
Thank you for mentioning that.

01:01:16.200 --> 01:01:18.680
I mean, so a couple of things there.

01:01:18.680 --> 01:01:21.360
One is that, yeah, I mean, you're absolutely right,

01:01:21.360 --> 01:01:26.360
of course, in talking about these AIs

01:01:26.640 --> 01:01:30.360
and instead of other problems with the existing life forms

01:01:30.360 --> 01:01:31.880
is a huge issue.

01:01:31.880 --> 01:01:33.920
It also comes up when people say,

01:01:33.920 --> 01:01:37.480
oh, wow, we're gonna make these high level intelligences

01:01:37.480 --> 01:01:39.840
and who knows how they'll be raised

01:01:39.840 --> 01:01:41.440
and what they're gonna do in the future.

01:01:41.480 --> 01:01:43.680
I mean, you've heard of having kids, right?

01:01:43.680 --> 01:01:46.400
Like, I'm just, you know, we do this all the time.

01:01:46.400 --> 01:01:49.640
We have an enormous amount of guaranteed high level

01:01:50.400 --> 01:01:52.240
intelligences that are created all the time

01:01:52.240 --> 01:01:55.720
and a huge diversity of good and bad environments

01:01:55.720 --> 01:01:56.720
that they're raised in.

01:01:56.720 --> 01:01:59.800
We have a very limited ability to make sure

01:01:59.800 --> 01:02:02.280
that they have a good embodied experience

01:02:02.280 --> 01:02:03.800
and are aligned with our values

01:02:03.800 --> 01:02:05.760
and some of them go on to do wonderful things

01:02:05.760 --> 01:02:08.640
and some of them go on to, you know, to do horrible things.

01:02:08.640 --> 01:02:09.680
That's already an issue.

01:02:09.680 --> 01:02:11.400
We already have that.

01:02:11.400 --> 01:02:14.240
The thing with, so these, in many ways,

01:02:14.240 --> 01:02:16.600
these problems are not new problems brought on by AI.

01:02:16.600 --> 01:02:19.600
They're perennial existential problems

01:02:19.600 --> 01:02:22.720
that humanity has faced forever, you know,

01:02:22.720 --> 01:02:25.240
in terms of being supplanted by the next generation

01:02:25.240 --> 01:02:27.840
that finds your values, you know, irrelevant

01:02:27.840 --> 01:02:29.600
and how much control do you want

01:02:29.600 --> 01:02:31.360
over how your neighbor is raising their kids

01:02:31.360 --> 01:02:32.320
and all these kinds of things.

01:02:32.320 --> 01:02:35.920
This has been with us for the longest time.

01:02:36.320 --> 01:02:40.880
The one unique thing about AI intelligences, though,

01:02:40.880 --> 01:02:45.160
is that they can be copied in a much easier fashion.

01:02:45.160 --> 01:02:46.560
They can be reproduced and copied

01:02:46.560 --> 01:02:49.200
in a much easier fashion than real animals.

01:02:49.200 --> 01:02:54.200
And I think that now, while there are some good debates

01:02:55.200 --> 01:02:57.680
about whether something that actually can be copied

01:02:57.680 --> 01:02:59.720
even counts in this case.

01:02:59.720 --> 01:03:02.160
So, you know, there's a few arguments

01:03:02.160 --> 01:03:05.600
that that's not an issue, but I'm not sure yet.

01:03:05.600 --> 01:03:08.240
And I think that for that reason,

01:03:08.240 --> 01:03:11.320
because there's just gonna be such an uncountable number

01:03:11.320 --> 01:03:14.400
of intelligences of the software variety,

01:03:14.400 --> 01:03:15.840
whether embodied or not,

01:03:15.840 --> 01:03:18.960
it's something that we need to consider, you know.

01:03:18.960 --> 01:03:21.520
And I'm hopeful that with the advent

01:03:21.520 --> 01:03:25.440
of different ways to grow food proteins and so on,

01:03:25.440 --> 01:03:28.440
we're gonna eventually completely do away

01:03:28.440 --> 01:03:30.600
with animal farming and so on.

01:03:30.840 --> 01:03:35.840
But the creation of novel synthetic organisms

01:03:35.840 --> 01:03:37.040
is only gonna increase.

01:03:37.040 --> 01:03:39.520
And I mean, you know, digital or embodied or not.

01:03:39.520 --> 01:03:42.400
So that's, you know, I think we need to focus

01:03:42.400 --> 01:03:44.640
on both sides of that equation.

01:03:44.640 --> 01:03:45.920
Yeah, I agree, agree.

01:03:45.920 --> 01:03:48.000
And I don't know if you're thinking on that

01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:50.680
as led you down the path of boycotting animal agriculture

01:03:50.680 --> 01:03:51.760
and its product so far,

01:03:51.760 --> 01:03:55.520
or whether I can help you offline on that path, but...

01:03:55.520 --> 01:03:58.040
Yeah, why don't we talk offline?

01:03:58.040 --> 01:03:59.080
Sounds good, sounds good.

01:03:59.120 --> 01:04:02.640
So the other ethical question I wanted to touch on with you

01:04:02.640 --> 01:04:05.320
is how that bears on your own work in the lab,

01:04:05.320 --> 01:04:07.680
because you do work with a variety

01:04:07.680 --> 01:04:09.960
of different entities, animal and non.

01:04:09.960 --> 01:04:11.200
How does that play in?

01:04:11.200 --> 01:04:14.120
Because you're into your choices,

01:04:14.120 --> 01:04:16.480
because you're working with some very simple organisms

01:04:16.480 --> 01:04:18.840
and you're working with more complex organisms as well

01:04:18.840 --> 01:04:20.240
that would have richer experiences.

01:04:20.240 --> 01:04:21.480
How do you think about that?

01:04:21.480 --> 01:04:23.000
Again, I won't take you through it in depth,

01:04:23.000 --> 01:04:25.520
but I'm interested in sort of simple perspective

01:04:25.520 --> 01:04:27.960
you take on animals and research.

01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:29.040
Yeah, yeah.

01:04:29.040 --> 01:04:33.720
Well, first, just to say that animal use and research

01:04:33.720 --> 01:04:36.320
is incredibly stringently regulated.

01:04:36.320 --> 01:04:38.480
So in order to do the things

01:04:38.480 --> 01:04:41.240
that somebody would do when they go fishing for an afternoon,

01:04:41.240 --> 01:04:44.600
we have three months of paperwork and oversight

01:04:44.600 --> 01:04:46.720
by veterinarians and ethicists and all that.

01:04:46.720 --> 01:04:49.240
So there's a huge amount of oversight,

01:04:49.240 --> 01:04:52.640
as there should be, I'm not in full favor of that.

01:04:52.640 --> 01:04:56.120
But this is something I think that's really important

01:04:56.120 --> 01:04:58.560
and it gets to this issue of what matters.

01:04:59.560 --> 01:05:04.160
A lot of folks see scientific ethics in the following way.

01:05:04.160 --> 01:05:06.560
Everything's great and you scientists

01:05:06.560 --> 01:05:08.240
better not screw it up, right?

01:05:08.240 --> 01:05:11.840
So here's a long list of things we don't want you to do.

01:05:11.840 --> 01:05:13.720
We don't want this, we don't want that.

01:05:13.720 --> 01:05:15.200
Don't make things worse.

01:05:15.200 --> 01:05:20.200
Now that could, I suppose could have been a viable worldview

01:05:20.560 --> 01:05:22.960
when people believe that our current world

01:05:22.960 --> 01:05:26.560
is in some way set up in the right way for us.

01:05:26.560 --> 01:05:28.880
In other words, it is the best possible world.

01:05:28.880 --> 01:05:31.600
Everything is great now, now don't screw it up.

01:05:31.600 --> 01:05:35.880
What we now know is that that's not the world we live in.

01:05:35.880 --> 01:05:40.880
We are the process of meandering evolutionary path.

01:05:40.920 --> 01:05:42.480
Evolution, as far as I can tell,

01:05:42.480 --> 01:05:44.640
does not optimize for any of our values.

01:05:44.640 --> 01:05:45.960
It doesn't optimize for happiness,

01:05:45.960 --> 01:05:47.800
for intelligence, for any of that stuff.

01:05:47.800 --> 01:05:50.400
No, we are where evolution dumped us

01:05:50.400 --> 01:05:52.600
with all of our ridiculous susceptibilities

01:05:52.640 --> 01:05:55.960
to bacteria, viruses, lower back pain,

01:05:55.960 --> 01:05:59.320
stray cosmic rays that might have hit a DNA molecule

01:05:59.320 --> 01:06:00.160
during development,

01:06:00.160 --> 01:06:02.640
and now your potential is radically limited.

01:06:02.640 --> 01:06:04.080
When you broaden that scope out

01:06:04.080 --> 01:06:05.880
to all of the potentially sentient beings,

01:06:05.880 --> 01:06:07.840
that just becomes even starker, right?

01:06:07.840 --> 01:06:10.440
If there is some tealoss to this universe,

01:06:10.440 --> 01:06:11.960
it's a pretty brutal one, yeah.

01:06:11.960 --> 01:06:13.640
It is, it is, there's no doubt.

01:06:13.640 --> 01:06:15.920
And so I'm not even a clinician,

01:06:15.920 --> 01:06:18.320
but the amount of emails that I get every day

01:06:18.320 --> 01:06:21.160
from people with the most unbelievable examples

01:06:21.400 --> 01:06:24.680
of biomedical suffering is just incredible.

01:06:24.680 --> 01:06:27.400
So I think it is utter moral cowardice

01:06:27.400 --> 01:06:29.960
to focus on what we shouldn't do.

01:06:30.880 --> 01:06:35.240
And as opposed to our duty now that we have,

01:06:35.240 --> 01:06:37.000
for the first time, I guess, on Earth,

01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:40.320
we have the ability to actually rationally approach

01:06:40.320 --> 01:06:45.320
these matters to try to guarantee a better embodiment

01:06:45.920 --> 01:06:47.880
for sentient beings on Earth.

01:06:49.320 --> 01:06:50.760
The number of people that are suffering

01:06:50.760 --> 01:06:52.160
because of our ignorance,

01:06:52.160 --> 01:06:53.720
because we don't know what to do,

01:06:53.720 --> 01:06:56.160
and also because of our timidity

01:06:56.160 --> 01:07:01.160
and our unwillingness to take responsibility for,

01:07:03.080 --> 01:07:05.080
we are the ones that are now,

01:07:05.080 --> 01:07:08.840
it is on us now to improve this for people.

01:07:10.080 --> 01:07:11.960
And not just people, for ecosystems,

01:07:11.960 --> 01:07:15.920
for other beings, for just the amount of ignorance

01:07:15.920 --> 01:07:19.560
and inaction that is letting a sentient being suffer

01:07:19.560 --> 01:07:21.440
worldwide is incredible.

01:07:21.440 --> 01:07:26.440
And so I take animal use ethics extremely seriously,

01:07:27.080 --> 01:07:30.160
but I think to the extent that it is our responsibility

01:07:30.160 --> 01:07:33.640
to relieve the suffering worldwide, science has to go on.

01:07:33.640 --> 01:07:36.480
And we have to do experiments that are going to enable us

01:07:36.480 --> 01:07:39.920
to improve embodied experience for all.

01:07:41.000 --> 01:07:46.000
This is just, the Buddhists have this concept

01:07:46.120 --> 01:07:47.720
of an inauspicious birth.

01:07:47.720 --> 01:07:50.160
And it's this idea that in one of your many lifetimes,

01:07:50.160 --> 01:07:52.840
you're born in a body during which you just can't make

01:07:52.840 --> 01:07:55.360
progress towards enlightenment.

01:07:55.360 --> 01:07:59.200
I think at this point, I know this is a controversial view,

01:07:59.200 --> 01:08:00.960
but I think basically right now,

01:08:00.960 --> 01:08:03.360
every birth is an inauspicious birth.

01:08:03.360 --> 01:08:08.240
All of us are limited by the vagaries of random mutation

01:08:08.240 --> 01:08:10.320
and selection and all these dumb things and viruses,

01:08:10.320 --> 01:08:13.200
all these dumb things that have no one's best interest.

01:08:13.200 --> 01:08:15.160
And I think in the future,

01:08:15.160 --> 01:08:20.080
sometimes I sort of imagine this dialogue that children

01:08:20.080 --> 01:08:22.280
in the future are going to have with their teachers,

01:08:22.280 --> 01:08:23.960
the kind of thing where you tell the kids,

01:08:23.960 --> 01:08:27.320
yeah, we wrote on chalkboards and we didn't have cell phones

01:08:27.320 --> 01:08:28.480
and like, what?

01:08:28.480 --> 01:08:30.960
And so they're gonna say,

01:08:30.960 --> 01:08:33.360
you're telling me you would just have to stay

01:08:33.360 --> 01:08:35.480
in whatever body you randomly got.

01:08:35.480 --> 01:08:36.600
And if you had some sort of defect,

01:08:36.600 --> 01:08:37.760
you just have to live that way.

01:08:37.760 --> 01:08:41.680
And if the IQ and the lifespan that you were born with

01:08:41.680 --> 01:08:44.040
wasn't enough to fulfill your goals, that's it.

01:08:44.040 --> 01:08:45.760
You just have to, you know, that was your bad luck.

01:08:45.760 --> 01:08:50.760
That will be unthinkable to a modern humans going forward.

01:08:51.960 --> 01:08:53.640
And in a way, that's a beautiful link

01:08:53.640 --> 01:08:55.520
into the final question, which is how do we make

01:08:55.520 --> 01:08:58.280
a better future, which is what are the promises

01:08:58.280 --> 01:09:02.160
of these types of research and thinking?

01:09:02.160 --> 01:09:04.680
Yeah, I mean, I think ultimately

01:09:04.680 --> 01:09:07.000
from the kind of the bigger picture for me

01:09:07.000 --> 01:09:08.840
is freedom of embodiment.

01:09:08.840 --> 01:09:11.280
I think that every sentient being should have the,

01:09:11.280 --> 01:09:14.040
and we need to, we should offer assistance

01:09:14.040 --> 01:09:15.920
in the same way that we offer assistance

01:09:15.920 --> 01:09:20.920
to beings via education, via support of every kind.

01:09:21.440 --> 01:09:25.180
We should be in a position to offer the ability

01:09:25.180 --> 01:09:28.080
for sentient beings to have better embodiments

01:09:28.080 --> 01:09:31.200
to fulfill their potential, their goals and so on.

01:09:31.200 --> 01:09:34.280
Practically speaking, what that requires

01:09:34.280 --> 01:09:37.480
is complete control over growth and form.

01:09:37.480 --> 01:09:41.320
It means that we need to really be able to direct

01:09:41.320 --> 01:09:43.420
what it is that cells build.

01:09:43.420 --> 01:09:46.080
Now, right now that just looks like regenerative medicine

01:09:46.080 --> 01:09:48.600
in the sense that if we knew how to get cells

01:09:48.600 --> 01:09:51.400
to build specifics as anatomical structures,

01:09:51.400 --> 01:09:54.640
then birth defects, traumatic injuries, cancer, aging,

01:09:54.640 --> 01:09:57.280
degenerative disease, all these things would go away

01:09:57.280 --> 01:09:59.720
if we could communicate our goals to groups of cells.

01:09:59.720 --> 01:10:02.320
And this is something that we and some other labs

01:10:02.320 --> 01:10:04.840
are working on now is this kind of, you know,

01:10:04.840 --> 01:10:06.740
this idea of an anatomical compiler

01:10:06.820 --> 01:10:08.700
where you can just specify the shape

01:10:08.700 --> 01:10:10.380
of the structure that you want

01:10:10.380 --> 01:10:14.420
and it gives stimuli to cells to make them grow exactly that.

01:10:14.420 --> 01:10:16.300
And again, linking to what you said before,

01:10:16.300 --> 01:10:18.660
this is different from the classical ideas

01:10:18.660 --> 01:10:20.980
of genetic engineering or, you know,

01:10:20.980 --> 01:10:22.020
what you do with CRISPR and so on.

01:10:22.020 --> 01:10:26.420
This is a different mode of engagement with a system.

01:10:26.420 --> 01:10:30.420
Yeah, the goal is similar because certainly people,

01:10:30.420 --> 01:10:32.980
you know, at the time that genetics was getting off

01:10:32.980 --> 01:10:35.340
the ground, this is a vision that people had then too,

01:10:35.340 --> 01:10:36.820
that if we understood the genetics,

01:10:36.820 --> 01:10:38.420
we could control the shape.

01:10:38.420 --> 01:10:42.820
I think we have a much more practical path to it

01:10:42.820 --> 01:10:46.060
because I think the genetics specifies the hardware

01:10:46.060 --> 01:10:48.700
that every cell gets to have, so the proteins.

01:10:48.700 --> 01:10:53.700
But as we know from the advances of computer science

01:10:53.880 --> 01:10:55.380
and information technology programming

01:10:55.380 --> 01:10:58.540
at the level of hardware, while possible, it's really hard.

01:10:58.540 --> 01:11:01.140
And if you have good hardware that's actually reprogrammable

01:11:01.140 --> 01:11:03.220
and offers high level interfaces, you know,

01:11:03.220 --> 01:11:05.220
you might say APIs, which I think is exactly

01:11:05.260 --> 01:11:08.580
what it offers, then you can do this in a much better way,

01:11:08.580 --> 01:11:13.580
specifically by honoring the agency of the cells and tissues

01:11:13.740 --> 01:11:15.300
and being a collaborator with them.

01:11:15.300 --> 01:11:18.620
We don't micromanage our cells and tissues here.

01:11:18.620 --> 01:11:21.100
I mean, in my group, we basically collaborate with them

01:11:21.100 --> 01:11:24.060
and modulate their goals and take advantage

01:11:24.060 --> 01:11:26.960
of their competencies, their problem-solving capacities,

01:11:26.960 --> 01:11:28.220
their memories and so on.

01:11:28.220 --> 01:11:32.540
So I think that is a way to move the field forward

01:11:32.540 --> 01:11:33.440
much faster.

01:11:33.440 --> 01:11:35.100
I think that CRISPR and those kinds of things

01:11:35.100 --> 01:11:38.380
are going to flatten out soon because after you've picked

01:11:38.380 --> 01:11:40.580
the low-hanging fruit of single gene diseases,

01:11:40.580 --> 01:11:43.020
the next question is gonna be, well, what genes do you add

01:11:43.020 --> 01:11:45.260
to make the changes, the anatomical changes do you want?

01:11:45.260 --> 01:11:47.060
And development's not reversible in that way.

01:11:47.060 --> 01:11:50.780
You can't just figure out what, in any easy way,

01:11:50.780 --> 01:11:51.620
what to edit.

01:11:51.620 --> 01:11:56.380
So I think taking advantage of the interfaces

01:11:56.380 --> 01:11:59.380
that cells use to hack each other is critical.

01:11:59.380 --> 01:12:02.540
But initially that just looks like reprogramming tumors

01:12:02.540 --> 01:12:06.460
and regrowing limbs and growing new organs and so on,

01:12:06.460 --> 01:12:08.020
all of which by the way we've done here

01:12:08.020 --> 01:12:10.460
in various model systems.

01:12:10.460 --> 01:12:13.180
But ultimately it leads to freedom of embodiment.

01:12:13.180 --> 01:12:15.940
It means that if you want to have a different embodiment

01:12:15.940 --> 01:12:18.140
you can, and if you decide you wanna change it,

01:12:18.140 --> 01:12:19.700
you should be able to do that too.

01:12:19.700 --> 01:12:22.500
There is no reason any of us should be stuck

01:12:22.500 --> 01:12:25.100
in the embodiment that we got,

01:12:25.100 --> 01:12:28.740
including IQ and lifespan and all those things.

01:12:28.740 --> 01:12:30.300
Because those things were not chosen

01:12:30.300 --> 01:12:31.820
with your welfare in mind.

01:12:32.500 --> 01:12:35.900
They were a long process shaped by forces

01:12:35.900 --> 01:12:38.020
that don't honor any of our values.

01:12:38.020 --> 01:12:39.020
Yeah, thank you.

01:12:39.020 --> 01:12:40.300
It's quite a vision.

01:12:40.300 --> 01:12:42.380
And it will lead to some of the things I've touched on

01:12:42.380 --> 01:12:44.220
with some of the people who are interested

01:12:44.220 --> 01:12:46.260
in the transhumanist space like David Pearson

01:12:46.260 --> 01:12:47.220
and so on as well.

01:12:47.220 --> 01:12:49.140
And again, it's that freedom of embodiment

01:12:49.140 --> 01:12:53.020
for human and non-human sentient beings

01:12:53.020 --> 01:12:56.420
that is, to put it a different way,

01:12:56.420 --> 01:12:58.980
shaped by their own values and aspirations

01:12:59.060 --> 01:13:03.980
and experiences rather than constrained by inherited biology

01:13:03.980 --> 01:13:06.500
and freeing from some of those constraints.

01:13:06.500 --> 01:13:11.500
But some of my audience will love that sort of vision

01:13:11.620 --> 01:13:14.020
and see the potential.

01:13:14.020 --> 01:13:17.060
Others will be nervous about classic problem

01:13:17.060 --> 01:13:18.700
of human hubris and intervening

01:13:18.700 --> 01:13:20.620
where we're not really ready to intervene.

01:13:20.620 --> 01:13:21.900
What do you think of the risk profile

01:13:21.900 --> 01:13:23.380
and the approach you're taking?

01:13:23.380 --> 01:13:24.780
Are there risks we need to watch out for

01:13:24.780 --> 01:13:27.980
that we need to build in?

01:13:27.980 --> 01:13:29.620
For sure, there are going to be risks,

01:13:29.620 --> 01:13:32.860
but I'm pushing in the very opposite direction

01:13:32.860 --> 01:13:35.180
of the hubris.

01:13:35.180 --> 01:13:38.780
My argument isn't that everything is great.

01:13:38.780 --> 01:13:42.820
And then in an effort to make it even better,

01:13:42.820 --> 01:13:44.340
we're going to screw things up.

01:13:44.340 --> 01:13:46.020
And we may screw some things up.

01:13:46.020 --> 01:13:47.780
It's pretty inevitable.

01:13:47.780 --> 01:13:51.460
My argument is that things are so bad right now

01:13:51.460 --> 01:13:55.500
for so many that it is a moral imperative.

01:13:55.620 --> 01:13:58.260
We do not have the luxury of saying,

01:13:58.260 --> 01:14:00.140
don't do this.

01:14:00.140 --> 01:14:01.900
Inaction is a choice too.

01:14:01.900 --> 01:14:03.060
Yeah, exactly right.

01:14:03.060 --> 01:14:07.700
The opportunity cost of doing nothing is massive.

01:14:07.700 --> 01:14:08.820
It's absolutely massive.

01:14:08.820 --> 01:14:13.820
And this idea that we don't have to do anything

01:14:15.700 --> 01:14:19.620
because we can let things go how they are now,

01:14:19.620 --> 01:14:21.380
that's simply not acceptable.

01:14:21.380 --> 01:14:24.940
That opportunity cost is too huge.

01:14:24.980 --> 01:14:28.220
So yes, we're going to make mistakes,

01:14:28.220 --> 01:14:31.380
but anybody who, we know from our personal lives,

01:14:31.380 --> 01:14:34.740
if the thing that you are most optimizing

01:14:34.740 --> 01:14:36.700
is to never make a mistake,

01:14:36.700 --> 01:14:39.460
what's going to be the value of your life

01:14:39.460 --> 01:14:41.940
and all the huffing and puffing

01:14:41.940 --> 01:14:45.500
that we do during our brief time here?

01:14:45.500 --> 01:14:46.500
What's the goal?

01:14:46.500 --> 01:14:48.140
If that's, I mean, obviously you want to minimize

01:14:48.140 --> 01:14:50.300
making mistakes, but there should be a constructive,

01:14:50.300 --> 01:14:52.780
I believe there should be a constructive element to this

01:14:52.820 --> 01:14:56.380
where you have a purpose to elevate and help others.

01:14:56.380 --> 01:14:58.780
And that is not going to happen by focusing

01:14:58.780 --> 01:15:00.900
on the things we shouldn't do.

01:15:00.900 --> 01:15:05.220
And just more broadly, I ask people who focus

01:15:05.220 --> 01:15:09.900
on this negative risk-based perspective,

01:15:09.900 --> 01:15:12.420
what does humanity look like 100 years from now?

01:15:12.420 --> 01:15:15.500
Are we still getting lower back pain and bad knees

01:15:15.500 --> 01:15:18.460
and dying into our 80s once we've gotten this

01:15:18.460 --> 01:15:19.660
a little bit of wisdom under our belts?

01:15:19.660 --> 01:15:20.500
Like that's it.

01:15:21.420 --> 01:15:23.020
And if you happen to, you know,

01:15:23.020 --> 01:15:27.020
some cosmic ray or something hits one of your chromosomes,

01:15:27.020 --> 01:15:29.060
then are we still living like that?

01:15:29.060 --> 01:15:29.940
I mean, I can't imagine.

01:15:29.940 --> 01:15:32.900
I just, that would seem like such a waste

01:15:32.900 --> 01:15:34.940
of this incredible gift of intelligence

01:15:34.940 --> 01:15:36.180
and compassion that we have

01:15:36.180 --> 01:15:38.060
that it seems ludicrous to me.

01:15:38.060 --> 01:15:40.700
But anybody, I think people should spend time

01:15:40.700 --> 01:15:43.260
painting the future that they do want, you know?

01:15:43.260 --> 01:15:44.420
Everybody's already paid, you know,

01:15:44.420 --> 01:15:45.780
written down all the things they don't want.

01:15:45.780 --> 01:15:46.620
That's fine.

01:15:46.620 --> 01:15:48.860
Now, paint me a picture of what do you want?

01:15:48.980 --> 01:15:50.820
Where should we be 100 years from now?

01:15:50.820 --> 01:15:51.660
Yeah, thank you.

01:15:51.660 --> 01:15:53.460
I'm a sucker for a bit of utopian thinking.

01:15:53.460 --> 01:15:55.540
I know you're a fellow sci-fi fan as well.

01:15:55.540 --> 01:15:58.220
And some people will use that as a way of discarding

01:15:58.220 --> 01:16:00.500
some of the ideas you're working on and saying,

01:16:00.500 --> 01:16:03.420
it's just sci-fi, but I think sci-fi's got a lot to teach you.

01:16:03.420 --> 01:16:06.580
So I often find better philosophy in sci-fi

01:16:06.580 --> 01:16:08.260
than I do in actual philosophy.

01:16:08.260 --> 01:16:10.460
And one of the things about sci-fi is it's very good

01:16:10.460 --> 01:16:13.380
at sort of intuitive sentientist stance

01:16:13.380 --> 01:16:16.180
because it's so common and just natural

01:16:16.180 --> 01:16:20.100
and even unthinking, most science fiction stories

01:16:20.100 --> 01:16:23.260
to recognize the salience of sentient beings

01:16:23.260 --> 01:16:24.740
that are radically different from ourselves.

01:16:24.740 --> 01:16:26.380
And I think there's a lesson there we can take too.

01:16:26.380 --> 01:16:27.220
So yeah.

01:16:27.220 --> 01:16:28.060
For sure.

01:16:28.060 --> 01:16:30.380
And you know, sci-fi, to me, if somebody says,

01:16:30.380 --> 01:16:33.060
this is just sci-fi, my question is very simple.

01:16:33.060 --> 01:16:34.540
Are you saying it's impossible

01:16:34.540 --> 01:16:36.100
or are you just saying it's gonna take a while?

01:16:36.100 --> 01:16:37.980
Like that's a certain things that maybe,

01:16:37.980 --> 01:16:38.820
I don't know what those would be,

01:16:38.820 --> 01:16:39.660
but there are certain things

01:16:39.660 --> 01:16:41.540
that may be physically impossible, fine.

01:16:41.540 --> 01:16:43.020
Everything else is just a time to,

01:16:43.020 --> 01:16:45.100
then we're just quibbling over a timetable.

01:16:45.140 --> 01:16:47.660
Everything that's possible is gonna be done.

01:16:47.660 --> 01:16:48.980
And there's dystopian sci-fi,

01:16:48.980 --> 01:16:50.500
but there's also utopian sci-fi.

01:16:50.500 --> 01:16:52.980
So yeah, like I say, paint those pictures.

01:16:52.980 --> 01:16:54.540
Well, it's been an inspirational conversation.

01:16:54.540 --> 01:16:57.060
Thank you so much for talking to me today, Mike.

01:16:57.060 --> 01:16:59.100
What's the best way of people following you,

01:16:59.100 --> 01:17:00.620
finding out more about your work?

01:17:00.620 --> 01:17:02.180
I'll include links in the show notes, of course,

01:17:02.180 --> 01:17:04.340
but where's the main place you point people?

01:17:04.340 --> 01:17:06.580
Yeah, the official lab website

01:17:06.580 --> 01:17:09.860
that has all of the kind of peer reviewed hard stuff

01:17:09.860 --> 01:17:14.220
is darmike11.org, one word, darmike11.org.

01:17:14.260 --> 01:17:16.100
The more speculative, you know,

01:17:16.100 --> 01:17:18.180
the photography, the pros and all that stuff,

01:17:18.180 --> 01:17:19.780
and so just some thoughts that I wouldn't,

01:17:19.780 --> 01:17:21.700
you know, I wouldn't put in a scientific paper

01:17:21.700 --> 01:17:23.820
is at thoughtforms.life.

01:17:23.820 --> 01:17:25.700
It's a blog called thoughtforms.life.

01:17:25.700 --> 01:17:29.060
And I'm on Twitter at at darmike11.

01:17:29.060 --> 01:17:29.900
Yeah, that's awesome.

01:17:29.900 --> 01:17:30.740
Thank you.

01:17:30.740 --> 01:17:32.580
And I'll follow up with some vegan tips offline.

01:17:32.580 --> 01:17:34.060
Cool, that would be great.

01:17:34.060 --> 01:17:34.900
I appreciate it.

01:17:34.900 --> 01:17:35.900
All right, well, thank you so much

01:17:35.900 --> 01:17:37.300
for being a guest on Sentientism.

01:17:37.300 --> 01:17:38.300
It's been a pleasure, Mike.

01:17:38.300 --> 01:17:40.100
Take care, enjoy the rest of your day.

01:17:40.100 --> 01:17:41.740
Thank you, you too.
