00:00.000 --> 00:04.000
People who haven't spent a lot of time in deep wilderness

00:04.000 --> 00:08.000
mostly don't know how much happier they would be if they were.

00:08.000 --> 00:14.000
Mostly don't know how many of their pains and illnesses and psychological disorders would go away,

00:14.000 --> 00:21.000
how much of the striving is actually a result of emptiness from living in an environment

00:21.000 --> 00:24.000
in which we don't have intimate relationships with other people in nature.

00:24.000 --> 00:32.000
If you spend time with an indigenous culture and see how much more they understand the language of all the animals,

00:32.000 --> 00:37.000
most people aren't aware of how impoverished their life is that they don't know how to communicate to the animals,

00:37.000 --> 00:40.000
that they don't know what the whole world around them is saying all the time,

00:40.000 --> 00:44.000
and that their mind is never still and quiet.

00:44.000 --> 00:49.000
So it's hard to feel bad about missing something you've never experienced and you don't know exists.

00:50.000 --> 00:57.000
Also, when the addict is coming down, they don't want happiness.

00:57.000 --> 01:00.000
They want a hit of the supply, right?

01:00.000 --> 01:04.000
If somebody's coming down on heroin, they don't want to see a beautiful sunset.

01:04.000 --> 01:07.000
They don't want a deep conversation with a friend.

01:07.000 --> 01:13.000
Everything else is meaningless because they have created a hypernormal stimuli

01:13.000 --> 01:16.000
that allows them to only get happiness from a very narrow thing.

01:16.000 --> 01:19.000
It's actually dead in their ability to get happiness from lots of things.

01:19.000 --> 01:22.000
So there are reward circuits in us that are more addictive.

01:22.000 --> 01:27.000
There are other reward circuits that are not addictive that are more actually...

01:27.000 --> 01:32.000
So the addictive reward circuit will give you a very quick spike and then it will drop you,

01:32.000 --> 01:34.000
and then that makes a craving for another spike.

01:34.000 --> 01:38.000
And obviously sugar does this and likes on social media do this

01:38.000 --> 01:42.000
and using filters to look more beautiful than you are does this and etc.

01:42.000 --> 01:46.000
Most of the things in our world do some version of this

01:46.000 --> 01:49.000
and then in the low, then you crave more of that thing.

01:49.000 --> 01:54.000
And so you get, of course, more bipolar type experience,

01:54.000 --> 01:57.000
but you also get an erosion of your baseline over time.

01:57.000 --> 02:00.000
There's less and less things that make you happy.

02:00.000 --> 02:04.000
You more and more need those stimulus and you need larger amounts of them.

02:04.000 --> 02:11.000
The types of reward circuits that lead to psychologically, physiologically, healthy people

02:11.000 --> 02:16.000
are ones that don't give you as much spike as quickly, but raise your baseline over time.

02:16.000 --> 02:19.000
And so the type of reward you get from exercising,

02:19.000 --> 02:23.000
the type of reward you get from meaningful conversation with friends,

02:23.000 --> 02:27.000
from helping somebody, from time in nature, you get reward circuits from those things,

02:27.000 --> 02:31.000
but they're different in kind than the reward circuits you get from fast food

02:31.000 --> 02:35.000
or from porn or from social media or those other things.

02:35.000 --> 02:38.000
But it's very hard to monetize those things on the supply side.

02:38.000 --> 02:42.000
It's very hard to sell you any of the things that on your deathbed

02:42.000 --> 02:46.000
you will say are what you wish you had spent all of your time with.

02:46.000 --> 02:48.000
Every person on their deathbed says,

02:48.000 --> 02:51.000
I wish I had spent more time with my family and with my kids

02:51.000 --> 02:54.000
and with the people that I loved and telling them that I loved them

02:54.000 --> 02:57.000
and working less and pursuing things less.

02:57.000 --> 03:01.000
And none of the hits that they were spending their life pursuing

03:01.000 --> 03:04.000
are at all meaningful in those reflections.

03:04.000 --> 03:09.000
But because the supply side can basically market to the addictive impulse better

03:09.000 --> 03:12.000
and it's important to understand that like from a business perspective,

03:12.000 --> 03:16.000
especially once you have a fiduciary responsibility to maximize shareholder profit,

03:16.000 --> 03:20.000
you're like legally bound to that as a director of public corporation.

03:20.000 --> 03:25.000
One of the core goals is maximize the lifetime revenue of a customer.

03:25.000 --> 03:29.000
And addiction is awesome for a lifetime revenue of a customer.

03:29.000 --> 03:34.000
So when you look at the emergence of fast food and processed foods,

03:34.000 --> 03:39.000
whether we're talking about hostesses and Twinkies or Candies or Coke or McDonald's,

03:39.000 --> 03:44.000
they're basically combinations of salt, fat and sugar,

03:44.000 --> 03:48.000
different combinations of that with different texture profiles

03:48.000 --> 03:52.000
that were actually scientifically optimized to maximize addiction.

03:52.000 --> 03:57.000
There were lots of split tests done to see which ones had the people crave them the most again.

03:57.000 --> 04:01.000
Yet the reason that people, in an evolutionary environment,

04:01.000 --> 04:05.000
the reason that things that had salt and fat and sugar

04:05.000 --> 04:09.000
gave people more of a kind of dopamine hit was because in an evolutionary environment,

04:09.000 --> 04:12.000
pre-agriculture, those things were very rare.

04:12.000 --> 04:14.000
It was hard to get much of them.

04:14.000 --> 04:18.000
And so if you got them, there was an incentive to go find the things

04:18.000 --> 04:20.000
that were evolutionarily rare and that were useful.

04:20.000 --> 04:23.000
As soon as we make them hyperabundance, then people are dying of the excess of them,

04:23.000 --> 04:26.000
we've built a world we're not actually genetically fit to,

04:26.000 --> 04:31.000
and then exploit the weakness of that rather than try to support people to navigate it well.

04:31.000 --> 04:36.000
But it's also that those nutrients were bound with vitamins and minerals

04:36.000 --> 04:38.000
and a lot of other nutrients simultaneously.

04:38.000 --> 04:42.000
So the fast food removes all the micronutrients,

04:42.000 --> 04:45.000
optimizes those things, optimizes addiction,

04:45.000 --> 04:50.000
and so you can have people who are actually dying of malnutrition while they're obese

04:50.000 --> 04:54.000
because they're so deficient in micronutrients.

04:54.000 --> 05:00.000
And so what fast food is to food where you just take the maximally addictive part

05:00.000 --> 05:05.000
and strip out why we're even attracted to it in an evolutionary environment,

05:05.000 --> 05:07.000
strip out all of what's good in it,

05:07.000 --> 05:11.000
is also what social media relationships are to human relationships,

05:11.000 --> 05:16.000
is also what porn is to human intimacy,

05:16.000 --> 05:23.000
is also what the news is to the desire to understand the world you live in,

05:23.000 --> 05:28.000
is what productivity is relative to meaning.

05:28.000 --> 05:34.000
Stripping out a very narrow, aligned with the interest of the market hit

05:34.000 --> 05:36.000
that still has that same thing,

05:36.000 --> 05:39.000
then you will feel a need for greater and greater productivity

05:39.000 --> 05:43.000
and of course that is great from a GDP maximizing perspective

05:43.000 --> 05:45.000
and not great from a deathbed reflections

05:45.000 --> 05:49.000
or the quality of how children are raised

05:49.000 --> 05:51.000
or the quality of the environment perspective.
