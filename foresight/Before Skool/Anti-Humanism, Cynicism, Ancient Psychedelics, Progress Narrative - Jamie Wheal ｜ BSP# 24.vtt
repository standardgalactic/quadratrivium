00:00.000 --> 00:14.040
Hi, Jamie. Welcome. Good to be here, Mark. Yeah, so I've recently discovered your talks

00:14.040 --> 00:17.800
and lectures and I haven't read your books yet, but what I've seen thus far has been

00:17.800 --> 00:21.840
awesome. Daniel Schmockdenberger referred me and said I have to talk to you. So I'm

00:21.840 --> 00:26.840
really excited to talk to you today. Yeah, happy to dive in. I mean, just getting to

00:26.840 --> 00:32.320
check out some of your beautiful drawing and animations on YouTube. It seems like you're

00:32.320 --> 00:37.520
barking up a number of very diverse and eclectic trees, but there is that kind of theme of

00:37.520 --> 00:43.040
sort of just better understanding, you know, the human condition, our past and our future.

00:43.040 --> 00:47.640
So, you know, obviously happy to jump in on all those things. Yes, I think that you and

00:47.640 --> 00:53.240
I are very aligned on what we're interested in, like from existential crisis to meaning

00:53.240 --> 00:58.120
to psychedelics and everything in between. So I'm really excited to just see where this

00:58.120 --> 01:04.280
conversation goes. For sure. So I thought we could start by just, you could introduce

01:04.280 --> 01:11.800
yourself to the audience. Sure. So my name is Jamie Wheel, and I am the founding executive

01:11.800 --> 01:18.360
director of the Flow Genome Project, which is an organization dedicated to the research

01:18.360 --> 01:24.040
and training of peak performance and leadership, and so sort of combination of neuroscience,

01:24.040 --> 01:28.160
anthropology, optimal psychology, and then, you know, quite often adventure leadership

01:28.160 --> 01:32.880
fun things to do in the wild and backcountry and mountains and oceans. And we get to work

01:32.880 --> 01:36.760
with everybody from, you know, executives at companies like Google and Deloitte and

01:36.760 --> 01:41.600
Disney and Lululemon and places like that, but also privileged to work with some of the

01:41.600 --> 01:47.400
tier one special operations community in the world, the SAS and Santos Military Academy

01:47.440 --> 01:54.160
in the UK, as well as SEAL Team 6 and Dev Group here in the US, and really always just

01:54.160 --> 02:01.080
curious about what makes us come alive, what lets us feel and perform at our best. And

02:01.080 --> 02:04.680
then fundamentally kind of almost back to the old school Greeks, you know, what is a

02:04.680 --> 02:10.720
good life well lived. And that inquiry has also led to me writing a couple of books.

02:10.720 --> 02:15.800
One was called Stealing Fire, and that was really trying to sort of trace and track the

02:15.800 --> 02:21.360
multi-thousand year history of ecstatic cultures, like those communities of practice that have

02:21.360 --> 02:26.640
sought and made the most of non-ordinary states of being. And again, that goes all the way

02:26.640 --> 02:32.760
back to one of Socrates' senior students stealing the psychedelic brew from the Lucidian

02:32.760 --> 02:37.480
Mysteries and throwing a house party in Athens, which was kind of a wonderfully weird and

02:37.480 --> 02:43.880
funny story, risking life and banishment, you know, to do so, all the way to contemporary

02:43.920 --> 02:49.600
expressions like Burning Man and other situations. And then most recently, I wrote a book called

02:49.600 --> 02:56.040
Recapture the Rapture, Rethinking God, Sex and Death in a World that's Lost its Mind.

02:56.040 --> 03:01.080
And really that one is just to say, hey, where are we going as a civilization? Feels like

03:01.080 --> 03:06.640
we're in kind of a tight spot. Seems like we're going to need to get much better at

03:06.640 --> 03:12.440
processing our grief at skillful and responsible accessing of peak states and connecting to

03:12.440 --> 03:19.040
each other in resilient, anti-fragile ways that don't end up in the ditch of dysfunctional

03:19.040 --> 03:25.200
or cultic communities. So how do we do this thing is fundamentally the ongoing inquiry?

03:25.200 --> 03:30.400
And what are some ways to have, you know, to have as meaningful and purposeful and healthy

03:30.400 --> 03:33.800
and happy and joyful lives as we can along the way?

03:33.800 --> 03:38.840
Oh, that's all brilliant. And I'm excited to dive deep. But first, I think I need to

03:38.920 --> 03:44.280
stop you and have you tell that story about the Illusinian Mysteries. Oh, I've been really

03:44.280 --> 03:50.080
fascinated with that whole ritual, the psychedelic brew. And so somebody stole the brew?

03:50.080 --> 03:57.120
Yeah, it's such a crazy story. And I actually shared it with a friend, Brian Marorescu,

03:57.120 --> 04:01.160
who wrote the immortality which kind of right, which blew up and expanded the story,

04:01.160 --> 04:05.800
which was fundamentally, I mean, Brian, Brian's new contribution is the, what does he call it,

04:05.800 --> 04:10.280
the archaeochemistry or something, but basically actually the fine grain scraping of the pots

04:10.280 --> 04:14.320
and things to see what was actually in them versus just the written record. But he was

04:14.320 --> 04:22.720
really just dusting off Ruck and Wasson's thesis from way back in the day about the potential

04:22.720 --> 04:30.960
LSA, you know, ergot fungus as the actual psychoactive kicker in the Greek Illusinian Mysteries.

04:30.960 --> 04:35.280
But what's so interesting about the Illusinian Mysteries is they persisted for 2000 years.

04:35.920 --> 04:41.080
You know, you're like, holy shit, like what cultural anything continues for 2000 years. And

04:41.080 --> 04:46.000
here's one of the wilder and woollier state experiences. And this is Plutarch and Cicero

04:46.000 --> 04:50.400
and Plato and arguably all the way back to Pythagoras and the Presocratics, like there was

04:50.400 --> 04:58.040
some serious juju coming out of this over a week long ritual with sleep deprivation and chanting

04:58.040 --> 05:03.640
and pageantry and costumes and all these other kind of state shifting technologies. But then

05:03.680 --> 05:11.920
also Kukion, this arguably quite credibly psychoactive brew. And if you were an initiate

05:11.920 --> 05:18.680
into the mysteries, you weren't allowed to share it or talk about it on pain of death. And so

05:18.680 --> 05:24.760
about 20 years ago, I was doing research and I just remember this random little snippet of an

05:24.760 --> 05:32.800
account from sort of Plato's era of a court case about someone having stolen the Kukion and

05:33.680 --> 05:38.400
then making use of it. And so in the writing of Stealing Fire, I was like, oh, I remember that.

05:38.400 --> 05:41.760
I've got to get back to that, dust it off, see what it was. The story was actually even better

05:41.760 --> 05:50.240
than I remembered. It turned out it was Alcibiades, who was this like rascal of a senior student of

05:50.240 --> 05:55.240
Socrates and potentially they were lovers. So he was kind of his like chicken boy, you know,

05:55.400 --> 06:01.720
slash like like sketchy sketchy sketchy teacher student relationships. But Alcibiades himself

06:01.720 --> 06:09.400
was a rascal. He then steals it. He ends up throwing a huge house party with the magic potion. So

06:09.400 --> 06:13.880
this is not that different than like Silicon Valley billionaires going to Burning Man, you know,

06:13.880 --> 06:19.320
and blowing the roof off the thing, he then gets ratted out by some rivals. And he ends up then

06:19.320 --> 06:24.200
betraying Athens. He's like this crazy double crosser, all sorts of things. He ends up actually,

06:24.200 --> 06:30.200
I just read two weeks ago, I think he ends up getting murdered in the end. But like his story

06:30.200 --> 06:36.040
is absolutely off the chart. So that idea that, you know, we often think of ancient things as very

06:36.040 --> 06:40.600
kind of stuffy and respectable, you know, and buttoned down. And that was the way they did

06:40.600 --> 06:44.200
things back in the past. And if we want to be respectable, we should do things more like they

06:44.200 --> 06:49.800
did not how we do now. And then you kind of realize this was almost identical. And it was literally

06:49.800 --> 06:57.400
like it was was it 22,000 or 2,500, whatever it was, it was almost to the day, an anniversary of

06:57.400 --> 07:06.200
when Ken Kesey was at Stanford University, unbeknowingly, taking MK Ultra, you know, the government

07:06.200 --> 07:13.160
psyops projects, taking their LSD as part of a medical study and stealing it out of the cabinets

07:13.160 --> 07:18.840
and taking it back to Stanford and lighting up all of the, you know, this was Larry McMurtry,

07:18.840 --> 07:24.680
the writer, this was where at Abbey Wallace Stegner, you know, all these like literary giants

07:24.680 --> 07:30.680
were there and they were literally like early 60s, getting lit up with exactly the same process,

07:30.680 --> 07:37.320
stealing fire, right, stealing the psychedelic magic. And then that booted up and turned on

07:37.320 --> 07:41.320
everything from the Grateful Dead is their house band, they were just a bunch of funky

07:41.320 --> 07:46.360
musicians in Palo Alto at the time, they pioneered psychedelic rock, which is now happening at the

07:46.360 --> 07:51.720
Sphere in Las Vegas with John Mayer, taking Jerry Garcia's place, you know, one of the largest

07:51.720 --> 07:59.480
grossing acts to this day over the last five years is still that lineage, as is all the Silicon

07:59.480 --> 08:05.560
Valley from the Homebrew Computer Club, all the way to the imaginings of AR and VR, all the way

08:05.560 --> 08:12.760
into the entire Burning Man culture and community, goes back to Ken Kesey stealing that government

08:12.760 --> 08:19.720
asset and throwing a house party. So the parallels are just, you know, you couldn't make up. And I

08:19.720 --> 08:25.480
think they are, they are fascinating because there's always that question of, can you bottle

08:25.480 --> 08:31.960
lightning without getting burned? You know, is there something that is tricksy? Is there something

08:31.960 --> 08:38.600
squirrely? Is there something inherently unstable and therefore kind of not scalable, right, about

08:38.600 --> 08:47.240
these experiences and also about the utterly predictable backlashes that they almost always

08:47.240 --> 08:53.240
seem to precipitate? And even just last week, right, we had the maps, FDA clinical trials,

08:53.240 --> 08:58.520
getting the hard breaks and the committee voting 10 to 1 against approving it because there's been

08:58.520 --> 09:05.480
a lot more scrutiny and a lot more attention. This was a MDMA, right? This was for the MDMA

09:05.720 --> 09:13.240
trial. This is a 40 year effort. And it's right there at the goal line. And potentially getting

09:19.080 --> 09:22.920
and potentially getting sidelined. And Jesus, I'm going to grab a drink.

09:22.920 --> 09:34.360
Yeah, yeah, yeah, no problem.

09:34.360 --> 09:53.080
All good. You are on fire right now. I am loving the pace of this podcast.

09:53.720 --> 10:00.200
Oh, great. Yeah, great, great. This is just me on normal settings. So we can play however you want.

10:00.280 --> 10:08.520
So the MDMA studies. So the MDMA studies and the FDA's oversight committee basically had to

10:09.080 --> 10:12.760
sift through, there was a petition and a kind of a complaint that, hey, things were a little fast

10:12.760 --> 10:16.520
and loose here with this, with this, you know, taking this drug to market and moving through all

10:16.520 --> 10:22.440
the phases of the trials. And one of the comments really struck me, which was one of the most

10:22.440 --> 10:29.080
significant concerns was, hey, by the way, we've heard that this MDMA, one of the known side effects

10:29.080 --> 10:37.960
is euphoria. And that's concerning, because euphoria means it has a high potential for abuse.

10:39.320 --> 10:45.640
And you think now, wait a second, this is the same FDA that Greenlit, Adderall and Ritalin,

10:45.640 --> 10:51.160
basically we've had, you know, and just in the last 18 months even, there's been a

10:51.160 --> 10:56.520
published report being like, oh yeah, by the way, all you parents that were talked into

10:56.520 --> 11:02.360
putting your little developmental kids on amphetamines for their adolescence and

11:02.360 --> 11:05.880
neurological development, there is no correlation between them, between that,

11:06.520 --> 11:10.600
and them doing any better in academic outcomes. They just kind of slipped that one into the

11:10.600 --> 11:17.320
news cycle like, sorry, kids, 30, 30 years of creating little speed freaks. And it wasn't even

11:17.320 --> 11:23.160
going to help them get into college. Right. So we did that. We did Celebrex, which turned out

11:23.160 --> 11:28.360
to be a huge, the largest settlement, class action settlement on killing people with a drug.

11:28.360 --> 11:31.720
What was Celebrex? We definitely did put in. What is Celebrex?

11:32.840 --> 11:36.920
Well, gosh, now I'm gonna, let me think, it might even be worth doing. Celebrex sounds familiar.

11:36.920 --> 11:46.040
So Celebrex, it might, what is the largest pharma settlement? It could be another one of those.

11:46.360 --> 11:52.680
It says Celebrex is used to treat pain and redness, swelling and heat inflammation.

11:55.000 --> 12:01.640
Oh, Vioxx. Vioxx. Right. We did Vioxx. We definitely did oxycontin,

12:02.600 --> 12:10.920
you know, and all of those drugs made it just fine through the process. But we are having real

12:10.920 --> 12:18.040
issues and hyperscrutinizing, one that also has euphoria. And HL Makin was that famous kind of

12:18.040 --> 12:25.560
very funny newspaper publisher back in the early 20th century. I think he said Protestantism,

12:25.560 --> 12:29.800
you know, and he said the definition of Protestantism is that sneaking suspicion

12:29.800 --> 12:37.640
that somebody somewhere is having a good time. Right. And so you can see like all the way back to

12:37.640 --> 12:42.280
Alcibiades back in ancient Greece and being taken to task for outing the mysteries, which,

12:42.280 --> 12:47.560
you know, fair cop, those were the road rules. Right. But nonetheless, it was fun enough, whatever

12:47.560 --> 12:53.320
that experience was, it was fun enough. He wanted to steal the magic brew for a house party

12:54.280 --> 13:00.280
all the way to Keezy in the early 60s at Stanford, unwittingly interacting with MKUltra,

13:00.280 --> 13:07.400
the Mind Control Government Project that Stranger Things is based on. Right. All the way to our

13:07.400 --> 13:15.320
current situation where we have MDA running up against FDA concerns about they might be having

13:15.320 --> 13:21.720
a little too much fun and we need to put those extra extra screws to them. So for me, that's

13:21.720 --> 13:27.880
you can boil it almost down to so what is that dynamic through through the ages is the sort of

13:28.680 --> 13:35.960
ongoing battle between the priests and the Prometheans. You know, there's always the priest

13:36.040 --> 13:41.800
class and they start out, you know, wearing black cassocks. Now they're the shiny men in

13:41.800 --> 13:46.920
black, the feds. Right. But it's still those in control of the status quo and the norms

13:47.640 --> 13:53.080
who are empowered to police consciousness. And then the honest to God Prometheans. Right. I mean,

13:53.080 --> 13:59.720
all the way back to the ancient myth. Prometheus is like, Hey, Daddy Zeus. It seems like there's a

13:59.720 --> 14:03.720
bunch of cold, starving, shivering little monkeys down there and I'm taking pity on them. Can we

14:03.720 --> 14:09.160
help them out? And Zeus is like, hell no. If we did, they'd get too epiti for their own good.

14:09.880 --> 14:13.000
Right. And Prometheus is like, all right, well, I'm going to do this anyway. My heart bleeds for

14:13.000 --> 14:17.160
them. Right. He's kind of an, he's almost like a Hellenic Christ figure. Right. And he's like,

14:17.160 --> 14:21.320
okay, so I'm going to do this on behalf of them. And he doesn't just bring them fire. He brings

14:21.320 --> 14:28.360
them civilization, technology, pottery, language, medicine, all of it. Right. And then there's

14:28.360 --> 14:35.160
hell to pay. Right. And so we see that that oscillating dynamic that the Prometheans find the juice

14:35.960 --> 14:39.720
wherever it is, wherever it's been buried, wherever it's been hidden, wherever it's been locked up,

14:40.360 --> 14:46.440
they free it. And there's almost always these explosive renaissance is right celebrations,

14:46.440 --> 14:52.360
rocking good parties. And then that starts giving you know, then other people start finding out

14:52.360 --> 15:00.280
about it, it draws attention, and then invariably gets shut down. And the real tell is the extreme

15:00.280 --> 15:05.720
prejudice with which it gets shut down. You know, it's not, hey, guys, cool it off. You know,

15:05.720 --> 15:11.000
turn down the music by 11, you know, make sure you clean up when you're done. It is like literally the

15:11.000 --> 15:19.320
most aggressive and violent reactive repression you could possibly imagine. And so it seems like,

15:19.320 --> 15:23.640
yeah, that, that, that ain't shell making quote, that idea of that, you know, the sneaking suspicion

15:23.640 --> 15:29.640
that somebody somewhere is having a good time. Right. And even last year with when Burning Man

15:29.640 --> 15:36.760
got, you know, rained out. And it was, I think, arguably the first year of that event, where

15:37.480 --> 15:43.880
the people at just because of enough starlings on site, right, there was a it became the first

15:43.880 --> 15:49.000
extremely online burn in history. Because in the past, you used to schlep it out to the desert,

15:49.000 --> 15:52.600
you were completely unplugged and out of touch for, you know, a week to two weeks,

15:52.600 --> 15:55.880
depending on how long you were there. And you were out of contact with all civilization,

15:55.880 --> 16:00.520
that was part of the magic and the mystery of it. This was an extremely online burn.

16:01.080 --> 16:04.360
And you had all the haters, and you had the New York Post, and you had crazy TikTokers,

16:04.360 --> 16:09.480
and you had right alt right wing nuts on Telegram talking about how this was a federal,

16:09.480 --> 16:13.400
this was Operation Mockingbird or whatever, you know, and then they were going to inject everybody

16:13.400 --> 16:17.320
with Ebola, you had people weighing in like that, you had people being like, Oh, look,

16:17.320 --> 16:22.040
there's Chris Rock and, you know, and, and, and, and Tiesto, and here's the cool DJs. And,

16:22.040 --> 16:27.080
and then you had people at Burning Man also reading these things, and then also commenting.

16:27.640 --> 16:34.760
And, and the amount of psychic energy that was devoted to making sense of what was a few rainy

16:34.760 --> 16:43.320
days was completely out of proportion with that and being a NASCAR race, or a football stadium,

16:43.880 --> 16:48.920
or, you know, a stamp collector's convention or anything. And so it is, I think, super interesting

16:49.960 --> 16:56.120
that how we hold notions of bliss, pleasure, joy, liberation,

16:57.560 --> 17:08.120
directly affect our, our willingness, our tolerance, our curiosity, and our positioning,

17:08.120 --> 17:14.920
because radical, whatever, you know, radical joy, radical awareness, radical freedom,

17:14.920 --> 17:22.600
is rarely in a vacuum and rarely without other people having strong opinions

17:24.040 --> 17:29.480
about how it can and should go down. Wow, I love everything you just said. I have

17:29.480 --> 17:33.320
quite a few thoughts. My first thing is I don't want to make this about me, but

17:33.880 --> 17:39.160
at Burning Man, Brian Morescu went there and people were very inspired by the video we made

17:39.160 --> 17:45.000
together on the Elusinian Mysteries and the, the great psychedelic secret and that whole ritual.

17:45.000 --> 17:51.000
So they built an entire section of Burning Man based on the idea that if you die before you die,

17:51.000 --> 17:57.320
you don't die. And that was written on this giant cup. It was massive. That was the Kukion cup.

17:58.120 --> 18:03.560
And they took, I don't know, like 10,000 drones and they put them up in the sky and they programmed

18:03.560 --> 18:11.640
them to create the images that I had drawn in our video, which just blew my mind, blew my mind.

18:11.640 --> 18:19.800
This was funded by the musk family. It was Kimble and Christiana. Right. Yeah. I don't know them,

18:19.800 --> 18:25.560
but I was just, when I saw the pictures of the drones making this DNA tree that I love to draw,

18:25.560 --> 18:31.240
I was like, that's insane. So that's one thing you reminded me of, which I think is really cool

18:31.240 --> 18:36.600
how this, this secret of the Elusinian Mysteries, it still lives on and it, and it's like, it still

18:36.600 --> 18:43.160
captivates us, you know? And then one thing you made me think of is like, can humans handle

18:43.720 --> 18:49.720
these very potent, powerful substances without these ancient rituals attached to them? Like,

18:49.720 --> 18:55.080
it seems like if you just take all the barriers down and you just give people these really powerful

18:55.080 --> 19:00.840
agents, sometimes they can't handle them and you look at cities that have made all drugs legal

19:01.480 --> 19:06.360
and it kind of didn't work in some ways, you know? You can't give people ultimate freedom

19:06.360 --> 19:13.640
without accountability. Are you seeing that? Yeah, but I think to quote the great philosopher,

19:13.640 --> 19:20.280
Homer Simpson, you know, he was like short answer, yes with an and long answer, no with a but,

19:20.280 --> 19:25.400
you know, I mean, the bottom line, I mean, there's a couple of things. If you're referring

19:25.400 --> 19:31.480
specifically to current U.S. cities efforts like Portland and Oregon and those kind of things and

19:31.480 --> 19:36.920
even Vancouver and those sort of things to decriminalize drugs, you could also potentially

19:36.920 --> 19:43.480
look to Portugal and a few other places in the world, you know, I think it's essential to differentiate

19:43.480 --> 19:49.240
or disambiguate between different classes of chemicals because they are radically different

19:49.240 --> 19:56.440
in their in both impact, user experience, pro-social white indoor health benefits or detriments.

19:57.320 --> 20:02.920
So the fact that folks were trying to do that, especially in North America, you know, in the

20:02.920 --> 20:10.200
last decade and quite and in the midst of both a quarantine lockdown crisis of public and mental

20:10.200 --> 20:17.480
and social health, as well as an opioid, you know, starting with oxy, going into street heroin,

20:17.480 --> 20:24.680
going into fentanyl, you're like, okay, those are not, that's not a cognitive liberty argument.

20:25.560 --> 20:30.040
And in fact, I was on stage speaking of Benningman, I was giving a talk at MAPS

20:30.840 --> 20:35.160
with Rick Doblin and Carl, gosh, what is Carl's last name?

20:37.880 --> 20:42.920
Hart? Carl Hart. Yes. Carl Hart, right? Who is who is that? I believe he's at Columbia.

20:43.640 --> 20:51.400
And he is a very strong cognitive libertarian, basically the idea that people should be free

20:51.400 --> 20:56.840
to consume anything they'd like. He's also quite infamously, as he, you know, wrote in his own

20:56.840 --> 21:03.640
books, a high functioning opioid user. So, you know, the thing there is like, you can, you know,

21:03.640 --> 21:08.120
motivated reasoning, you know, there is an element where he's like, of course, you're going to argue

21:08.120 --> 21:13.800
to be left alone to do the thing that you like to do, and may or may not be able to, you know,

21:13.800 --> 21:26.680
stop or start at will, right? But the urban situations does lead you to question how safe,

21:27.480 --> 21:35.000
stable, prosocial are accessed to these tools and techniques. I've written in like my last book,

21:35.720 --> 21:40.600
a suggested model of social psychedelic use, which would be a bell curve. And basically,

21:40.600 --> 21:46.840
10% of the population, those with family histories of Doctriad personality, so narcissism,

21:46.840 --> 21:53.240
Machiavellianism, sociopathy, authoritarianism, schizophrenia, you know, borderline personality,

21:53.240 --> 21:58.280
any number of situations where like, hey, your medical and or family history does not suggest

21:58.280 --> 22:03.560
this is a good role of the dice, so don't, right? That 10%, take those folks out.

22:05.480 --> 22:12.840
Only 10% of the population should probably ever do them more than one, two or three times in their

22:12.840 --> 22:17.640
entire life. And those could be sort of the psychonauts, test pilots, the cultural creators,

22:17.640 --> 22:21.560
whatever those people are that self select and are willing to kind of learn and apprentice to the

22:21.560 --> 22:27.560
skill sets. And then, you know, the overwhelming majority in the middle, what would it look like

22:27.560 --> 22:32.200
to do what you suggested, which is reintegrate these state experiences within a initiatory

22:32.200 --> 22:37.560
culture of ritual framework, aka the anthropology, the neuro anthropology of it. And you can make

22:37.560 --> 22:44.680
a case then if you're like, okay, well, how have civilizations, how have societies made use of

22:45.720 --> 22:51.640
hardship or deal, initiation and access to transcendence, vision quest, rights of passage,

22:51.640 --> 22:54.760
all those kind of things. So you can make a case, hey, first one kind of makes sense.

22:55.480 --> 23:01.720
And the right of passage from adolescence to adulthood, right, that that great, very famous

23:01.720 --> 23:06.920
book by Alex Haley that then became I think the most watched mini series ever roots, right,

23:06.920 --> 23:11.080
which was about the African diaspora and the slave trade. But back in Ghana, I think it was,

23:11.880 --> 23:16.040
you know, Kuntakinte is the lead, you know, he's the kind of the hero that makes his way

23:16.040 --> 23:21.880
through the story. But as a baby, he is born in West Africa, and his father holds them up to

23:21.880 --> 23:28.360
this incredible Milky Way night sky. And he says, behold, Kuntakinte, the only thing in the universe

23:28.360 --> 23:34.760
greater than you. Right. And it's this beautiful, like, like, welcome to the world kind of moment.

23:34.760 --> 23:39.560
And here's your place in things. Here's your place against the vast and the infinite, the Milky Way,

23:39.560 --> 23:44.440
the night sky, here's your place in your family, here's your place in your community. And so

23:44.440 --> 23:49.960
picturing that, you know, fast forward 15 years, picturing that as our initiation for young men

23:49.960 --> 23:55.880
and young women into adulthood, because right now we've got failure to launch, we've got kids

23:55.960 --> 24:01.880
kicking the can down the road on an extended adolescence, right, until they're 30, which is,

24:01.880 --> 24:06.680
I think, arguably, a little too long. You know, it's like, I'm just going to smoke weed and jerk

24:06.680 --> 24:10.920
off to porn and play first person shooter games in my parents' basement, and then become an angry

24:10.920 --> 24:15.640
incel, you know, because I don't have a snatched jawline like all the chads who are snagging all

24:15.640 --> 24:22.120
the stasis, you're like, that's wildly dysfunctional. You know, and so what we need, you need

24:22.120 --> 24:27.160
moments of effective initiation that actually are transformational. They're not as Michael

24:27.160 --> 24:33.480
Pollan called them placebo sacraments, right, you actually need the real deal, so that if I pass

24:33.480 --> 24:41.080
through that threshold, I am no longer the same person, my relationship and obligation to the

24:41.080 --> 24:45.080
world is not the same. So authentic initiatory rites of passage, and you know, folks have been

24:45.080 --> 24:49.000
talking about that, that's not a particularly profound insight, it's just pronounced on how

24:49.000 --> 24:55.480
absent they are. And the next one could arguably be marriage, right, so picture, you know, and if

24:55.480 --> 24:59.720
you wanted to get really down into the details and programming, right, you could be like, oh,

24:59.720 --> 25:05.240
that initiatory rite of passage could be three grams of psilocybin, or it could be a functional

25:05.240 --> 25:11.400
ayahuasca experience or something along those lines, right, slow enough, not acutely intense enough

25:11.400 --> 25:16.680
to just scramble you, you know, like DMT or like five MEO or something like something along those

25:16.680 --> 25:21.640
lines, but you know, a real, you know, like the world's enchanted and magical, you know, and I'm

25:21.640 --> 25:28.600
being and seeing that, right, so that is an initiatory process. For partners and couples, and you

25:28.600 --> 25:34.440
know, maps has been parallel tracking this, which is MDMA as couples therapy. So imagine if, you

25:34.440 --> 25:38.200
know, instead of sort of sitting with your rabbi or sitting with your priest or whoever the sort of

25:38.200 --> 25:43.400
minister of your ceremony would be beforehand as a young couple, you know, like a happy couple to

25:43.400 --> 25:47.560
be, what are you guys going to do? What are your commitments? What are your obligations? What might

25:47.560 --> 25:55.480
it be like for them to take MDMA together? And with some form of guidance or facilitation, right,

25:55.480 --> 25:59.800
it could just simply be loving friends and family, it could be a minister, it could be whatever, to

25:59.800 --> 26:06.040
actually speak their deepest hopes and fears for and their pledging of their love for each other

26:06.760 --> 26:13.480
in a way that marriage then became that communion, not simply, oh, we got a Williams and Sonoma

26:13.480 --> 26:17.400
guest list and please make sure we get enough linens to match our silverware, you know, and there

26:17.400 --> 26:22.280
we are, you know, doing our destination wedding for the gram, you know, like all of these super

26:22.280 --> 26:28.280
hyper superficial things that don't carry you through the doldrums, don't carry you through the,

26:28.280 --> 26:31.720
we've got two kids under the age of three and we've been sleepless for six months and I, you

26:31.720 --> 26:35.720
know, and I don't even know who I am anymore, let alone who you are anymore, and this doesn't

26:35.720 --> 26:42.920
feel fun anymore, you know, and couples just drifting under the burden of being householders

26:42.920 --> 26:48.200
together, which is, you know, which is an unmitigated son of a bitch, if you don't have, you know,

26:48.200 --> 26:54.040
the other things that come with deep connection and potential communion. And then the obvious final

26:54.040 --> 27:01.000
one is just end of life. What might it mean, there I am, you know, sliding off this mortal coil

27:01.640 --> 27:07.480
and really whatever, you know, I mean, there's so many stories of either staunch atheists who then

27:07.480 --> 27:13.640
get religion at the end, you know, or devout believers who then doubt everything or whatever it

27:13.640 --> 27:21.000
might be, but basically facing the reaper is a great equalizer on whatever worldviews or philosophies

27:21.000 --> 27:26.680
you played through, you know, the rest of your life with and an experience like, and again, this is

27:26.680 --> 27:34.040
all wildly open to interpretation and curation, but you know, an experience like 5MDMT, which many

27:34.600 --> 27:41.720
participants do report is as close as anyone can imagine to a near death experience of sort of,

27:41.720 --> 27:47.160
you know, brilliant white light encounter with source consciousness, you're like, oh, okay,

27:47.160 --> 27:53.320
many people who have had that experience prior to dying, go out of their way to mention, I'm no

27:53.320 --> 27:57.960
longer so afraid of my physical death. I know what's on the other side, I've had a quick sneak peek

27:57.960 --> 28:05.880
preview. And so imagine that and not just by itself, like, oh, let's just get grandpa loaded to, you

28:05.880 --> 28:10.760
know, and put him in front of some, you know, immersive VR and see what happens, but much more

28:10.760 --> 28:16.920
like, hey, grandma grandpa, here is this sacred experience, you get to peek around the corner

28:17.400 --> 28:23.800
of where your path is going soon. And then you get to come back and now, potentially with guided

28:24.440 --> 28:30.200
therapy with, you know, again, family facilitation, what is it that you'd like to share? What are the

28:30.200 --> 28:34.520
places to make amends? What are the truths you want to pass on to your grandchildren? What are the

28:34.520 --> 28:39.480
heartfelt things you want to share with your own kids? You know, and so we could really reintegrate

28:40.600 --> 28:46.840
disassociated teens and bring them across the threshold into adulthood, partnership in union,

28:47.400 --> 28:53.000
which, you know, you don't have to be a sort of card carrying conservative to just acknowledge

28:53.000 --> 29:00.360
that, hey, as parents come together to make more children and further our nation, our communities,

29:00.360 --> 29:06.600
our species, having them be happy and connected is generally a better thing than having them

29:06.600 --> 29:12.680
alienated and fragmented. And then end of life. I mean, you know, and Baby Boomers have kind of

29:12.680 --> 29:18.440
led the way every, every stage of their own development, you know, the famous kind of me

29:18.440 --> 29:21.480
generation, you know, when they were young, they were all about personal growth and development

29:21.480 --> 29:24.200
and transcendence. And then they were in their middle years, and they were all about making

29:24.200 --> 29:28.440
bank and, you know, money and kind of Wall Street greed is good kind of thing. And now they're

29:28.440 --> 29:35.240
shuffling off the coil. So there's naturally, this is a great time to revisit our end of life

29:35.240 --> 29:41.480
rituals and ceremonies. And compared to, hey, grandma or grandpa, we found them off to a nursing

29:41.480 --> 29:45.800
home five years ago, because it just got too difficult, you know, and now we are paying

29:45.800 --> 29:50.680
exorbitant amounts of money to these companies who hire minimum wage employees who dope grandma

29:50.680 --> 29:56.520
grandpa to the gills, you know, on sedatives, you know, whatever it is to keep them docile and

29:56.520 --> 30:02.440
manageable. And they die, you know, and we maybe we guiltily, you know, obligingly show up around

30:02.440 --> 30:08.520
their bed when it's when the time is getting really close, but they're often out of it. And

30:08.520 --> 30:12.280
they die under fluorescent lights, hooked up to tubes, and you're like, Oh my God,

30:12.920 --> 30:18.680
like we can do so much better than that. Just from a heartfelt human sense, but also even just from

30:18.680 --> 30:26.280
sort of clinical and therapeutic outcomes sense. So that to me, would be a really meaningful

30:27.240 --> 30:33.960
wrapper that culturally and interrelationally and communally, we sort of can and ought

30:34.760 --> 30:40.760
to include in these peak states and experiences because the downside of the maps medicalization

30:40.760 --> 30:44.920
model, which was a very strategic tactical thing, which is like, let's make this respectable,

30:44.920 --> 30:48.440
let's make this legit, let's go through all the proper channels and let's speak in the language

30:48.440 --> 30:52.760
of mainstream dominant society. So they actually understand and can validate what we believe is

30:52.760 --> 30:58.920
to be true and precious about these experiences, aka PTSD, depression, smoking, smoking cessation,

30:58.920 --> 31:04.280
anxiety, right? All the, all the kitchen sink stuff that has been laid at the feet of the

31:04.280 --> 31:09.480
psychedelic experience, and instead be like, look, guys, those, those are epiphenomena.

31:10.200 --> 31:16.200
You know, those are little bells and whistles that may or may not be improved by an encounter

31:16.200 --> 31:21.080
with the numinous. But can we actually just sort of let the mystery stay the mystery? Can we actually

31:21.080 --> 31:28.840
just say, Hey, these experiences seem to somewhat reliably gain us access to non ordinary states

31:28.840 --> 31:34.840
of being where there is a certain sacredness, suchness, magic, mystery, you know, insight,

31:34.840 --> 31:39.720
delight, aesthetic appreciation, you know, take your pick as to which of those things, you know,

31:39.720 --> 31:47.560
you want to hang your hat on and then just say, Hey, we can't and we shouldn't try and pin that down

31:48.200 --> 31:55.080
to the 17th decimal place. That kills it. You know, and it reminds me of that. There's an old

31:55.080 --> 31:58.760
joke. I think I think Mark Twain used to tell it, but like the web, like probably not because this

31:58.760 --> 32:05.560
is too, too recent a story that the plot is there's a biologist checking to see how far frogs, frogs

32:05.560 --> 32:09.320
can jump and he gives them different commands. And he's like, Oh, a frog, you know, a frog,

32:09.320 --> 32:13.160
when given the command to jump will jump 10 centimeters. And then he takes an exacto knife,

32:13.160 --> 32:16.520
you know, a little scalpel, lops off one leg. And he's like, And then when I gave the frog

32:16.520 --> 32:20.680
another command to jump, yeah, he only jumped seven and a half centimeters. And then I chopped off

32:20.680 --> 32:24.360
another leg and gave him the command to jump. And he only jumped five centimeters. And then,

32:24.360 --> 32:27.880
you know, I cut off his final leg and gave him the command to jump and nothing happened.

32:27.880 --> 32:34.920
So I now conclude that a frog with no legs is deaf. And you do and you kind of think that's

32:34.920 --> 32:43.160
sort of how our, you know, again, big pharma double blind placebo controlled DSM five correlate

32:43.960 --> 32:48.600
psychedelic research is, you're just like, Do you guys know even what you're looking at?

32:48.600 --> 32:53.320
Or are you all pretending that there is not this magical mystical

32:53.320 --> 32:58.680
initiatory experience behind those doors? And we're just sort of all sort of that that's,

32:58.680 --> 33:06.200
that's the, in some respects, that's the, that's the scam is we're all pretending that there's

33:06.200 --> 33:11.160
no magic and mystery there. And if we all stay on that hymn book of like incongenity,

33:11.160 --> 33:16.040
such and such, such and such in conjunction with clinical therapy, you know, is going to result

33:16.040 --> 33:20.120
in all of these outcomes, but it's a little like that, you know, Hunter Thompson's fear and loathing

33:20.120 --> 33:24.520
in Las Vegas, you know, like, you know, we were somewhere outside of Boston when the drugs began

33:24.520 --> 33:27.800
to kick in, right? And then famously, they're driving along that Cadillac and then they pick

33:27.800 --> 33:31.960
up the hitchhiker, you know, and Hunter's peaking. And he's like, When are we going to tell him

33:31.960 --> 33:36.680
about the bats? You know, don't worry, the poor bastard will see him soon enough himself, you

33:36.680 --> 33:44.360
know, and you kind of think that to me, that's, that's the shadow side of the conventional

33:44.440 --> 33:51.000
pharmacological medicalization and VC corporate, you know, experience of this quote on quote,

33:51.000 --> 33:57.320
psychedelic red renaissance is we're going to get Prozac Nation 2.0 with new and improved

33:57.320 --> 34:05.720
five HT 2a receptor sites, you know, versus anything, but I mean, just imagine if 30 years

34:05.720 --> 34:12.440
ago we'd gone down the religious liberty route and had said, Hey, placebo sacraments suck,

34:13.160 --> 34:21.800
you know, and we as humans deserve cultural communal encounters and renewal for healing

34:21.800 --> 34:30.920
and inspiration of the mystery. And that's our birthright. Not I deserve a copay for a coded illness

34:30.920 --> 34:36.440
for my worried wellness of tired, wired, stressed and anxious. And I've heard that this new magic

34:36.440 --> 34:43.880
pill might allow me to keep going as one more how slightly better adjusted cog in the neoliberal

34:43.880 --> 34:51.320
machine. Wow, you just said a lot of things that are that kind of I'm going to have to

34:51.320 --> 34:55.240
sit and reflect on everything you just said and rewatch that clip because that yeah,

34:56.760 --> 35:03.480
well said, well said. And I've jotted down quite a few notes, but I think on a on a grand level,

35:03.480 --> 35:10.120
you made me think of this progress narrative that we've been given that if you're really

35:10.120 --> 35:14.680
materialist in your thinking, things are just getting better and better and better. We have

35:14.680 --> 35:22.520
more stuff. Everybody has a bigger flat screen TV. They often point to metrics like life expectancies

35:22.520 --> 35:29.160
longer, child infant mortality is lower. Look at all our pharmaceuticals, look at our health

35:29.160 --> 35:34.280
industry, look at how much food people have. And they say that's a progress narrative. Is that

35:34.280 --> 35:41.560
progress narrative a lie? Yeah, I mean, that's such a good question. That's literally the subject

35:41.560 --> 35:51.880
of my next book. And I'm so I'm deep into the research right now. And I mean, I think the only

35:51.880 --> 35:56.600
honest answer and I actually had this conversation with Daniel Schmackenberger several years ago,

35:56.600 --> 36:02.360
it just hasn't, you know, the foundational conditions are the same, which is is that

36:03.320 --> 36:09.240
for most of us right now, it's bafflingly confusing to figure out kind of quote unquote,

36:09.240 --> 36:15.320
what's really going on? Because when you do see Hans Rosling or Steven Pinker or, you know,

36:15.320 --> 36:22.200
pick your favorite Ted talk, you're like, Oh, my gosh, you know, this is the most peaceful we've

36:22.200 --> 36:26.760
ever been. This is the most people living above the poverty line. This is, you know, just the

36:26.760 --> 36:33.000
litany of public health statistics that are suggesting this is the best of times. And then

36:33.000 --> 36:37.960
you end up either on an environmental channel or just doom scrolling your news feed. And you become

36:37.960 --> 36:44.120
very quickly convinced, Oh, no, we are going off the cliff with no skid marks, you know, to our doom,

36:44.120 --> 36:49.160
and we probably deserve it. You know, like, look how many dumb, terrible, stupid ass things we're

36:49.160 --> 36:55.080
doing, we deserve what's coming. Like, and so things are getting exponentially worse and getting

36:55.080 --> 37:02.360
exponentially better at precisely the same moment. And Oh, by the way, this super advanced techno

37:02.360 --> 37:07.560
industrial society with pronounced civil liberties and incredible hyper mobility and access to the

37:07.560 --> 37:12.520
world's information, you know, is also the very same container that is allowing us to do all these

37:12.520 --> 37:17.880
personal growth and healing and waking up experiences. Right. And so you sort of you wake up,

37:17.880 --> 37:23.080
and then you're like, Oh, my God, wait, when did I wake up? I woke up now in this moment. I mean,

37:23.080 --> 37:30.440
I had that experience going skiing in Colorado a few years ago. And it was a spring skiing and

37:30.440 --> 37:38.520
we're rolling into town and everything was melting. Right. And it was early, like it was it

37:38.520 --> 37:44.360
felt like May and it was actually mid March. And you know, there was muddy waters down the streets

37:44.360 --> 37:48.520
and there was grass and straw showing around, you know, and there we are riding this lift and

37:48.520 --> 37:54.200
they just, you know, having lived most of our life in Colorado and knowing the history of the ski

37:54.200 --> 37:58.040
industry, you're like, Holy shit. So I'm riding this lift and I'm watching everything melt around

37:58.040 --> 38:01.800
us and being like, Hmm, I don't know how much longer the ski industry is going to be a thing.

38:01.800 --> 38:07.960
And then thinking, Wow, this ski industry was the direct byproduct of the military industrial

38:07.960 --> 38:13.480
complex. The 10th Mountain Division had trained just over the hills from us. They went to Italy,

38:13.480 --> 38:17.960
fought in the Alps. They all came back from the Alps, started Veil, started Aspen, started Sun Valley.

38:18.440 --> 38:23.880
Right. The skis, we the skis and snowboards we ski on have advanced petrochemical, P tech

38:23.880 --> 38:27.320
spaces that are super slidey with metal edges and all these things when flex patterns and all

38:27.320 --> 38:33.160
this kind of stuff that the lifts and all the steel and all the all the things. Right. The very

38:33.160 --> 38:41.000
techno industrial war mongering society that made this possible of like little monkeys sliding

38:41.000 --> 38:46.760
down white stuff in the mountains for fun is also the very thing that's also melting this

38:46.760 --> 38:53.400
planet's atmosphere. Right. And so that was just a tiny example of what we're experiencing globally

38:53.400 --> 38:59.560
and at scale right now, which is that our awareness has gone through the roof at the same time that

38:59.560 --> 39:06.760
what we need to be paying attention to or be made aware of is that the very same culture that has

39:06.760 --> 39:16.760
birthed us is also threatening to kill us. And most people can't hold that cognitive dissonance.

39:16.760 --> 39:21.480
So we toggle between the coming alive arc of like, what's the infinite? You know, what's my

39:21.480 --> 39:27.880
hashtag best life? What's my optimum personal growth? What's the way do I want to go? Who do I

39:27.880 --> 39:32.840
want to be unlimited possibilities? And then also societally, you know, what is a world where

39:33.480 --> 39:37.160
any gender is welcome? What is a world of post-racial equality? What is a, you know,

39:37.160 --> 39:42.040
what is a realm where the bottom four billion of the global south have equity and inclusion? And

39:42.040 --> 39:48.120
we've made reparations for all the dirty, dirty deeds of the last 500 years, etc. Right. So that's

39:48.120 --> 39:53.160
that's the coming alive arc. And it's sort of, it's not time bound and it's not resource dependent.

39:53.160 --> 39:58.360
It's a sort of infinite open. What's the best thing we can possibly imagine and live into?

39:59.320 --> 40:04.200
And then that gets clipped by the staying alive arc, which is very time bound and very resource

40:04.200 --> 40:09.240
constrained. And it's like, Oh, shit, you know, should I have my money in fiat or crypto? Should

40:09.240 --> 40:15.240
I get a, should I get an, you know, a golden passport in Portugal, you know, or maybe I've heard

40:15.240 --> 40:19.640
that St. Kitts is dishing them out, or do I need to get down to Mexico or do I hunker down in the

40:19.640 --> 40:25.880
US or do I fleet a Canada, right? Or those kinds of things. Or like, what do we do? Right with

40:25.880 --> 40:31.880
best places on the maps? I mean, a buddy of ours was, was it was an SVP at Google,

40:32.840 --> 40:38.280
who got super freaked out during, I think it was the 2018 California fires or maybe it was

40:38.280 --> 40:42.360
later than that actually, because it was during COVID, it was that super dystopian situation

40:42.360 --> 40:48.520
where families were like fleeing San Francisco to get to Tahoe, where they could see sky and their

40:48.520 --> 40:53.160
kids could breathe again in the midst of a pandemic with masks on, you're like, Oh my gosh, this is,

40:53.160 --> 40:56.600
you know, this is bleak, right? That wig them out to the point where he's like, Okay,

40:57.320 --> 41:02.200
California's off my list. I'm moving my family somewhere to be safe. And he did all the research

41:02.200 --> 41:06.280
being a, you know, an engineering quanti guy with the world's best search engines at his fingertips.

41:06.280 --> 41:11.800
And he concluded that Lahaina Maui was the safe place on an island in the middle of the Pacific

41:11.800 --> 41:17.480
in a tropical rainforest. And that's where he was going to post up. And he got clipped. Right with

41:17.480 --> 41:21.960
the Lahaina fires, which, you know, kind of reminds me of the, there's again, an old Greek story of

41:22.920 --> 41:29.800
someone going to the Oracle at Delphi and being told, tomorrow you will, you will die. And he

41:29.800 --> 41:35.800
flees Athens for spotter. He's like, Oh, fuck that noise. I'm getting out of dodge. And then

41:35.800 --> 41:41.960
runs into the Reaper in a crowd in spotter. And he's shocked. And he's like, What are you doing?

41:41.960 --> 41:47.560
And he's like, I was waiting for you. So that notion for all of us these days that there's sort

41:47.640 --> 41:55.800
of, there is no a way. And it's on us to pick our spot to make our stand and then get on with living

41:55.800 --> 42:02.360
through this feels like an important part of how do we reconcile that impossible contradiction of

42:02.360 --> 42:06.280
things are exponentially better and worse at the same time? And where do I even map that? Right?

42:06.280 --> 42:09.560
I mean, I think if you think, if you've heard, in fact, I guess people have heard of it because

42:09.560 --> 42:14.280
it's called the three body problem is isn't that that the new HBO show, right with the Game of

42:14.280 --> 42:20.200
Thrones guys, I think it is, but anyway, the three body problem refers to in astronomy slash

42:20.200 --> 42:25.480
physics, it's very, very hard to map and model is one thing to map like the moon going around the

42:25.480 --> 42:30.280
earth. But when you throw in the sun and the moon and the earth and where all things are in

42:30.280 --> 42:37.880
relationships to each other, it gets herdy, goody in a hurry. And we've got an eight billion body

42:37.880 --> 42:43.960
problem, all agentic little egos bouncing around each other. So how on earth we map them

42:45.160 --> 42:53.160
leads to cognitive shorting out leads to emotional psychological overwhelm and leads to

42:54.040 --> 43:00.760
boatloads of grief, as we potentially run all the traps run the numbers and come to the conclusion

43:00.760 --> 43:08.840
that the world as we have known it might not actually be as stable or foreordained or given

43:08.840 --> 43:15.240
or even, you know, predictably carrying forwards as we might have thought, as we might have hoped,

43:15.240 --> 43:22.520
as we might have been led to believe. So how do we grieve in all of this? Also, you know, in a healthy

43:22.520 --> 43:29.640
way, you know, in a powerful way, in a way that leaves us cleansed and grounded and stronger and

43:29.640 --> 43:36.840
wiser versus in a way that leaves us kicking and screaming and embittered and feeling victimized

43:37.480 --> 43:42.600
feels like a super important part of what you know, what life might look like going forward or

43:42.600 --> 43:47.880
kind of part of the immune our immune systems. That will be really helpful for us to develop.

43:49.240 --> 43:54.040
Hmm. Well, part of that progress narrative is that technology is going to save us. And that's

43:54.040 --> 43:59.160
going to be our get out of jail free card. Do you think that we could develop some technology that

43:59.160 --> 44:05.000
fixes all our problems? Yeah, I mean, Mark Andreessen, right, of Andreessen Horowitz, you know,

44:05.000 --> 44:10.840
famously, infamously wrote the techno optimist manifesto last year. And he was basically coming

44:10.840 --> 44:18.920
down hard on the side of technology progress is it has always been with God knows what's got us

44:18.920 --> 44:27.560
out of the last pickle. It is forever will be. And anybody who isn't for utterly unregulated

44:27.560 --> 44:32.360
affected, you know, the term that sort of showed up on Twitter is effective accelerationism,

44:33.080 --> 44:38.520
right, instead of effective altruism, right, the idea of just like pin it. Let's put every penny

44:38.520 --> 44:45.720
and every calorie and every gigawatt we've got into general artificial intelligence, basically a

44:45.720 --> 44:53.560
silicon God. And that'll fix it. Which, you know, if anybody's seen, you read the stories of Dr.

44:53.560 --> 44:59.240
Faustus or seen Fantasia with Mickey and the Sorcerer's Apprentice, you know, or any countless,

44:59.240 --> 45:06.280
countless tale where humans are tempted to go for ultimate power or knowledge, right, and they try

45:06.280 --> 45:10.520
and grab for that ring, you know, there's not a single story where that one comes up roses.

45:11.080 --> 45:16.840
So there's a lot in our kind of mythical memory, as well as our historical memory of, you know,

45:16.840 --> 45:23.000
all we ever do is kick the can down the road to greater, more complex, wicked problems from

45:23.000 --> 45:28.360
solving our earlier ones. You know, and some of the classics would be, oh, you know, London fog,

45:28.360 --> 45:32.280
right, London fog was because we were burning too much coal. And then we discovered, you know,

45:32.280 --> 45:37.800
quote unquote, cleaner burning diesel and hydrocarbons fossil fuels, actually liquid fuels,

45:37.800 --> 45:42.760
that was much better London London fog as a pollution went away. The, you know, New York and

45:42.760 --> 45:47.480
Chicago and Paris and London were, you know, in the 1890s were up to their kneecaps and horseshocks

45:47.480 --> 45:52.360
of all the carriages. And then Henry Ford invented the Model T. See, look, we keep doing this,

45:52.360 --> 46:00.840
right. And so there are these really well worn tropes about what is our direction does is there

46:00.840 --> 46:05.800
a teleological thrust, meaning is there a point or a purpose to where we're going. And then all the

46:05.800 --> 46:11.480
stories of progress are yes, it's high into the right, right, the curve goes up, and we're on

46:11.480 --> 46:18.760
times arrow, it's going someplace, which really wasn't, you know, wasn't argue arguably, that is

46:18.760 --> 46:25.000
a highly Judeo Christian concept, right. It's not until the Hebrew and Christian sacred scriptures

46:25.000 --> 46:29.640
had an alpha and had an alpha in the beginning was the word and the word was good, right,

46:30.280 --> 46:35.720
and an omega, an endpoint that we actually got to have connect two dots on a line and create

46:35.720 --> 46:40.920
times arrow. Now, there's all sorts of reasons, you'll your pregine, the Nobel laureate and

46:40.920 --> 46:44.920
physics and others have, you know, played with, you know, what, what is the notion of times

46:44.920 --> 46:50.520
arrow, not just as a cultural story, but as potentially a deep code of physical reality,

46:50.520 --> 46:55.560
aka you can't unscramble an omelet, those kind of things, there's certain appearances of

46:55.560 --> 47:00.680
directionality that breaks down at a quantum level. And and pregine actually had another

47:01.880 --> 47:05.400
really meaningful contribution to this, so just to be clear, so we're talking about Mark

47:05.400 --> 47:09.800
Andreessen posting something on, you know, effective altruism or effective accelerationism,

47:09.800 --> 47:14.120
we're talking about the sort of tried and true progress narrative. And now we're kind of kicking

47:14.120 --> 47:20.040
it down to well, what's true at the base levels of reality. And pregine advanced this notion of

47:20.040 --> 47:25.480
complex dissipative structures, and that a complex dissipative structure could be a human, like we,

47:26.040 --> 47:31.800
talking, breathing, loving, writing poetry, doing whatever, we're far more complex than the 28

47:31.800 --> 47:36.520
minerals and elements that make up our bodies, right. And when we die, we go back to decomposing

47:36.520 --> 47:41.640
and pushing up daisies, and that is a less complex state than we were when we were alive. So a human

47:41.640 --> 47:47.720
is a complex dissipative structure, when we need constant inputs of energy, aka food and water,

47:47.720 --> 47:53.800
or we die, right, and that's the dissipating part. And so are civilizations. And the more

47:53.800 --> 47:58.680
complex our civilizations get, the more energy they need to keep them going without collapsing.

47:58.680 --> 48:02.840
And of course, as we're contemplating for the first time in human history, a transition from

48:02.840 --> 48:08.680
burning ever denser carbon, right, in fact, West Jackson, who's at the Land Institute in

48:08.680 --> 48:12.760
Salina, Kansas, he's one of the great kind of environmental and ecologists, he's a sort of

48:12.760 --> 48:16.920
contemporary of Wendell Berry. He said something interesting, he said, basically, you can make

48:16.920 --> 48:24.200
a case that all of human civilization is just the hunt for ever denser carbon, and ever hotter fire,

48:25.080 --> 48:29.480
right. So from like rubbing sticks together, you know, and just burning up trees and twigs,

48:29.480 --> 48:36.200
and that kind of stuff, to ceramics and kilns, like now we can actually cure Earth in a

48:36.200 --> 48:40.920
waterproof, bugproof storage container for our grains. So now we can take starlight

48:40.920 --> 48:45.720
in the form of photosynthesis and grain production, and we can bend time, right,

48:45.720 --> 48:50.520
by keeping it in pots. And then the Bronze Age, oh my gosh, if we dig up some of this stuff, we'd

48:50.520 --> 48:55.800
dig up tin and copper, and we put it in a hot enough fire, we can make bronze, that's amazing.

48:55.800 --> 48:59.720
We have swords and poke people and beat the shit out of the people that don't have

48:59.720 --> 49:04.280
sharper, pokey things. And so then you get into the Iron Age, oh my gosh, even better.

49:04.360 --> 49:10.120
And then all the way into the Silicon Age, we can melt sand, turn it into glass, turn it into

49:10.120 --> 49:15.160
lenses, turn it into silicon chips. But at 1500 degrees, right, all the way to like the Large

49:15.160 --> 49:21.800
Hadron Collider, where we have the light and heat of our sun. So we're forever hunting hotter fire

49:21.800 --> 49:26.680
to heat ever more dense and interesting star stuff, to our own benefit and advantage.

49:27.640 --> 49:32.120
Which, back to Prigagine, and the notion of complex dissipative structures, right,

49:32.200 --> 49:39.000
is the idea that he makes the case, and other physicists and writers who've kind of built

49:39.000 --> 49:47.000
on his work since, is that our complexity, our civilization, all the cool stuff that we like

49:47.000 --> 49:54.760
to think of as, you know, human, isn't actually random. It's actually a very, very elegant way

49:54.760 --> 49:58.840
of the universe reconciling the second law of thermodynamics, a.k.a. all things tend to

49:58.840 --> 50:02.600
entropy over time. Because if you're in that camp, you're like, oh, we're just, we're just

50:02.600 --> 50:08.200
random fluctuations where we shouldn't be here, roll the dice a million times more and we wouldn't

50:08.200 --> 50:14.440
be here, right? There is no point or purpose. We're an accident of randomized genetic mutation,

50:14.440 --> 50:20.920
right? There's definitely that camp, right? Prigagine would say, hey, yes, it's true that the

50:20.920 --> 50:26.520
universe tends towards the heat, you know, heat death, right, and a complete unspooling of all

50:26.520 --> 50:31.640
order and complexity over time. But wouldn't you know it? A complex dissipated structure is actually

50:31.640 --> 50:37.560
the universe's best way to get to entropy in the end. So if you take an example of like, if there's,

50:37.560 --> 50:42.920
if, you know, your bathtub is filled with water, and then it needs to drain all the way to daylight,

50:42.920 --> 50:46.760
you know, through your basement, through your pipes out to the stream or the river, right?

50:46.760 --> 50:51.880
Well, what does it do? It creates a whirlpool, which is a complex dissipated structure. It is one

50:51.880 --> 50:57.960
of the best ways to take an energy gradient of a ton of water, resisting gravity, you know,

50:57.960 --> 51:05.160
high to all the water going low and draining out. What's the best thing? Create a whirlpool

51:05.160 --> 51:09.240
to migrate it. The same thing with hurricanes, right? You've got a low pressure and a high pressure

51:09.240 --> 51:12.840
system. You've got someplace that's really cold and dense, and you've got someplace that's hot and

51:12.840 --> 51:18.120
light and it's, and if it's powerful enough, what does it do? It creates that giant whirlpool

51:18.120 --> 51:26.120
situation and it mixes, right? It very, very effectively mixes the energy gradient. It balances

51:26.120 --> 51:33.640
it. So if you're in that prigogene camp, you would say, hey, we are complex dissipated structures.

51:33.640 --> 51:41.560
We are enacting. So we have a purpose and it's a way to reconcile the second law of thermodynamics.

51:41.560 --> 51:49.080
This all ends in the ditch, right? With the goodness, truth and beauty that may emerge,

51:49.080 --> 51:56.120
right, in us and we're not just random accidents. We are actually agents centered in the bigger and

51:56.120 --> 52:03.880
greater unfolding of universal physical and energetic processes. So now let's go back to,

52:03.880 --> 52:08.680
because that's just kind of like, that's a nerdy sidebar, but I think it's super important because

52:08.680 --> 52:14.440
if you're just dealing with like warring, like Twitter wars, like Mark Andreessen and the EX

52:14.440 --> 52:18.920
versus the degrowth or D cell haters, and you just piss in a pissing match at that level,

52:20.120 --> 52:28.520
we're not necessarily kind of taking in the whole context and getting beyond opinions and into

52:29.240 --> 52:39.800
outlooks that are potentially rooted in more deeply structural reality. So, right, the reality

52:39.800 --> 52:47.000
of, hey, is technology going to save us, right, is the way forwards even faster, right, the folks

52:47.000 --> 52:50.520
that are like, again, like Mark Andreessen, he has a great phrase, he said, we're teaching sand to

52:50.520 --> 52:54.680
think, right, and that's what we're doing with artificial general intelligence. And you can make

52:54.680 --> 52:59.080
a case like, are we just being carbon based life form chauvinist? Is it just because we're

52:59.080 --> 53:02.920
carbon based life forms? And everything else we know on this planet is carbon based that we

53:02.920 --> 53:07.720
somehow have a prejudice, like we're special and unique, and we're the honest and good and true,

53:07.720 --> 53:12.920
but silicon based consciousness is somehow an abomination, and we should prosecute it and shut

53:12.920 --> 53:18.760
it down. Like, that's an interesting question. You know, and that's where Larry Page has been,

53:18.760 --> 53:22.680
that that was the rift between him and Elon, where he was basically, you know, he accused Elon

53:22.680 --> 53:26.760
famously of being a speciesist, you know, like you actually, you know, Sam Altman has said,

53:28.040 --> 53:32.440
in fact, he came on right after us, giving a talk at Benningman, a couple of it was,

53:32.440 --> 53:36.840
it was like six months before ChatGPT launched, so it was before he, you know, he, his, his sort of

53:37.720 --> 53:42.760
recognizability had blown up to the level it is now. And he said, basically, there's only two

53:42.760 --> 53:48.840
options for humans, we either become cyborgs, meaning we're sort of like supplemented augmented,

53:48.840 --> 53:55.160
you know, but not just biological people anymore. Or we just become bootloaders to

53:55.160 --> 53:59.480
silicon consciousness. We're just the little monkeys with thumbs that were just clever,

53:59.480 --> 54:05.080
just clever enough to dig up all this stuff and heat hot fires, right, and make the silicon and

54:05.080 --> 54:11.800
organize a bunch of buried fossil fuels starlight and energy to pump into the grid until, you know,

54:11.800 --> 54:14.840
silicon consciousness could boot up and say, thanks very much, you clever little monkeys,

54:14.840 --> 54:19.800
we're now going to eliminate you, you know, or enslave you, you know, Allah, Skybot and the

54:19.800 --> 54:29.240
Matrix and everything else, or Skynet. Yeah, so, so I think there's a, you know, a very practical

54:29.240 --> 54:35.960
and real question, which is, can we decouple, like what, you know, Gwyneth Paltrow, I think,

54:35.960 --> 54:40.920
famously talked about conscious uncoupling, like for divorces that don't get nasty, right. And I think,

54:41.560 --> 54:46.440
for all of us, there's a question of what is conscious decoupling look like. And in this

54:46.440 --> 54:52.920
instance, it's, it's, can we decouple our carbon burn, right, from our quality of life?

54:54.360 --> 55:03.400
And if we can, then we buy the time and the, and the options to architect a more inclusive,

55:03.400 --> 55:10.120
more creative civilizational structure. And if we can't, then there's very real questions back to

55:10.120 --> 55:14.520
the degrowth side of the argument, which is like, Hey, no, actually, look, look at us, we're, we're,

55:14.520 --> 55:21.480
we're grossly obese, we're wildly unhappy. You know, Marie Kondo became a thing because there's,

55:21.480 --> 55:26.760
you know, $23 billion storage industry, like we have way too much stuff. And we literally have

55:26.760 --> 55:33.320
way too many calories hanging on our bodies, like clearly we've overshot some sweet spot,

55:33.320 --> 55:39.320
right, for quality of life versus energy bone. Even though that that even that statement

55:40.360 --> 55:44.520
seems surprisingly controversial, you'll still get slammed with being a degrowth or in a D cell,

55:44.520 --> 55:50.440
and you'll be accused of wanting to deny some poor starving, you know, grandmother in Africa or

55:50.440 --> 55:54.680
India, you know, denying her the right for her refrigerator and cell phone and air conditioning,

55:54.680 --> 55:59.000
you know, you're like, no, no, no, that's not what we're talking about. Right. But we are saying,

55:59.000 --> 56:06.360
is there, is there a mark we've overshot on calorie burn versus the quote unquote good life?

56:07.000 --> 56:13.720
And can we, because many of the sort of eco optimists and Hannah Ritchie is the most recent,

56:13.720 --> 56:17.080
she's at Oxford, and she just recently published a book, I think called It's Not the End of the

56:17.080 --> 56:22.920
World, but she's a protege of Hans Rosling and Max Roser at the Our World in Data project.

56:24.440 --> 56:27.960
You know, they're basically making the case of like, hey, guys, we can have everything.

56:28.760 --> 56:35.000
Right. Everybody can have, all we need to do is just heat pumps and Teslas, right. And we don't

56:35.000 --> 56:42.360
need to back off on any of the stuff we've got. Right. And also some, you know, rhetorical play

56:42.360 --> 56:50.200
to that mother in Africa or India and giving her a chance of the good life too, which fundamentally

56:50.200 --> 56:57.880
is their own socializations of Simon Cousnets, the Nobel Prize winning economist who came up with

56:57.880 --> 57:03.160
GDP, but he also came up with something called the Cousnets curve. Right. And specific subset of

57:03.160 --> 57:07.880
the Cousnets curve is the EKC, the environmental Cousnets curve. And you've definitely heard this

57:07.880 --> 57:11.400
argument, even if you didn't know, that's what it was called. It was just basically that more

57:11.400 --> 57:17.160
advanced societies pollute less. Right. So that basically all of Europe and the United States,

57:17.160 --> 57:22.680
et cetera, we're on the happy far right side of the Cousnets curve. And we don't have, what would

57:22.680 --> 57:27.320
we do, but we just, we're not still building as many dirty coal power plants. We don't have people

57:27.320 --> 57:31.080
using diesel and kerosene heaters to heat their homes or we're going to cook their foods, et cetera,

57:31.080 --> 57:37.880
et cetera. So basically Ikea and Volvos and Tesla's good, you know, in Western Europe and the US

57:37.880 --> 57:45.960
and coal and kerosene, you know, in China and India bad. And the goal there, you silly humans,

57:45.960 --> 57:50.120
right, is to get everybody up and over the Cousnets curve as fast as possible. And any

57:50.120 --> 57:55.000
efforts to pump the brakes is wrong-headed, counterproductive, destructive and anti-human.

57:55.000 --> 57:59.560
That's typically the argument. Right. Now, back to motivated reasoning, like we were talking about

57:59.560 --> 58:03.720
Karl Hart, the functioning opioid user slash professor, arguing for cognitive liberty and

58:03.720 --> 58:09.320
people getting to shoot up and do what they want to do. We are massively motivated to accept the

58:09.320 --> 58:17.400
argument and that sort of the almost religious dogma of the Cousnets curve because it gives us

58:17.400 --> 58:23.400
permission to keep doing exactly what we wanted to do anyway. Right. And the realities are there

58:23.400 --> 58:27.400
have been quite a bit of, there's been quite a bit of kind of, you know, replication studies and

58:27.400 --> 58:32.520
those kind of things on the Cousnets curve. It doesn't exist always. It's not a law of nature.

58:32.520 --> 58:36.840
It was most pronounced at a very specific time and place, which was post World War II in Western

58:36.840 --> 58:44.360
Europe and kind of the G20 countries, OECD, you know, North America, et cetera. It hasn't replicated

58:44.360 --> 58:48.280
in a bunch of other countries like in Asia and other places in the global south that have attempted

58:48.280 --> 58:52.520
it since then. And it's wildly variable and dependent on a bunch of conditions, including

58:52.520 --> 58:57.880
are you at war or not? Like, like this war is not going to be eco-groovy ever. We burn a ton of

58:57.880 --> 59:03.160
shit and we blow up a ton of shit and we don't care because it's war. Right. So there's a thousand

59:03.160 --> 59:09.800
reasons why the Cousnets curve is not a law of nature, even though it's implicit in every single

59:09.800 --> 59:16.200
pro-growth argument you pretty much ever hear. And up against it is Javon's paradox. And Javon's

59:16.200 --> 59:21.640
paradox is when things get cheaper, you don't consume them cheaper, better, faster, cheaper.

59:22.440 --> 59:27.480
You typically don't end up with a decrease in usage and consumption. You actually end up spiking

59:27.480 --> 59:32.360
and incenting even more consumption. So as we've done all the wind and all the solar and all the

59:32.360 --> 59:36.680
batteries and all the good groovy stuff, right, our carbon burn right now is higher than ever.

59:38.120 --> 59:43.640
So it's basically Cousnets curve versus Javon's paradox. Right. Can we say enough is enough?

59:43.640 --> 59:51.320
Can we buy some efficiencies and bank them or is every innovation going to then incent even further

59:51.320 --> 59:55.160
extreme growth? And as a funny example of that, right, I was just reading this morning that the

59:55.160 --> 01:00:00.280
Paris Olympics were set out to be super groovy, low carbon footprint. Right. And of course,

01:00:00.280 --> 01:00:05.960
they're French and, you know, historically, weather's been really quite nice and mild and

01:00:05.960 --> 01:00:11.640
temperate in Paris in the summers. So they didn't bake in air conditioning, right, to all of that,

01:00:11.960 --> 01:00:17.480
to the athlete's village. And now they've just done a survey. Every single one of the G8 countries,

01:00:18.040 --> 01:00:24.680
right, minus the host, are bringing in portable air conditioners for their athletes because they're

01:00:24.680 --> 01:00:30.280
like, no, fuck that. We are people cannot be flopping around on damp sheets, you know, before

01:00:30.280 --> 01:00:35.480
their race day, they need to be in 68 degrees. So you see this fascinating thing of like Andrew

01:00:35.480 --> 01:00:43.080
Huberman, Tim Ferriss, biohacking optimization culture, right, you should sleep cold and dark

01:00:43.080 --> 01:00:49.400
in 68 degrees, which is awesome, right. I'm a huge, huge fan of cold nights, but it's an incredible

01:00:49.400 --> 01:00:55.960
privilege. And the fact that France attempted to make these Olympics as clean and groovy as possible,

01:00:55.960 --> 01:01:01.720
but in that stand has run right up against carbon footprints and it would have been far on the irony

01:01:01.720 --> 01:01:05.800
is they would have been far more eco groovy if they'd actually baked in air conditioning properly

01:01:06.360 --> 01:01:11.960
into their builds versus having everybody run extension cords, you know, to generators,

01:01:11.960 --> 01:01:16.600
to run little portable units. And so just back, that's back to coming alive versus staying alive,

01:01:16.600 --> 01:01:21.560
those two arcs, coming alive, hey, 68 degrees is your optimum sleep temp to get your earring best

01:01:21.560 --> 01:01:27.880
scores. And staying alive is, oh my gosh, we're burning so much fossil fuel, we're overheating the

01:01:27.880 --> 01:01:37.000
earth. Wow, that was brilliantly said, I love that rant. And you just, you said so many things.

01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:44.760
And I guess I, one thing I wanted to mention is the changing narratives.

01:01:46.680 --> 01:01:52.600
Particularly, I can use movies as an example. I remember when I was young in the 90s, we had

01:01:52.600 --> 01:01:58.120
movies that were about humans saving the world. It was like Armageddon, deep impact,

01:01:58.760 --> 01:02:04.440
some huge comment was going to hit us and we had to stop it. Then probably about 10 years later,

01:02:04.440 --> 01:02:10.440
I noticed a changing narrative where earth is is we've messed up earth too much, and we have to

01:02:10.440 --> 01:02:14.840
leave and find some other home. I'm thinking of movies like interstellar. And that seemed to be

01:02:14.840 --> 01:02:19.960
like a common theme. I started seeing that a lot more. And then maybe about 10 years later,

01:02:20.520 --> 01:02:25.560
I noticed movies that were really pessimistic that humans weren't really a species worth

01:02:26.360 --> 01:02:31.720
keeping going. So we were going to end humans now. And we're going to pass the torch on to

01:02:31.720 --> 01:02:38.040
something new. And I noticed that theme. I'm also noticing a similar change in narrative with AI.

01:02:38.600 --> 01:02:41.880
You know, for a long time, we had all these movies that made AI the villain.

01:02:42.600 --> 01:02:46.200
That it was this huge existential threat that was going to take humans out.

01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:52.200
Now I'm starting to see some interesting movies coming out, where AI is the good thing,

01:02:52.200 --> 01:02:57.400
and it keeps society together. And the villain is somebody that comes and shuts that AI off,

01:02:58.200 --> 01:03:03.560
and then causes chaos. And I thought, Oh, that's a really interesting like predictive programming

01:03:03.560 --> 01:03:09.640
that you're trying to instill in us. And I guess it makes me think that there's some sort of anti

01:03:09.640 --> 01:03:15.800
human agenda. You mentioned that there's this camp of people that think that we're like

01:03:15.880 --> 01:03:23.000
accidents. And I believe that that anti human agenda is coming from that side.

01:03:23.640 --> 01:03:26.200
Are you seeing it all like an anti human agenda?

01:03:28.680 --> 01:03:33.400
Yeah, I mean, that's such a great question. And I'm a huge fan of tracking things in film,

01:03:33.400 --> 01:03:40.280
exactly as you did. Like what's the pulse? What's the zeitgeist of our moment, right? And I certainly

01:03:40.280 --> 01:03:47.480
noticed it with Marvel comics, and even Black Panther, where you had both Thanos and Killmonger,

01:03:48.200 --> 01:03:53.640
right? As the anti heroes, they were the bad guys. But the bad guys were actually expressing

01:03:53.640 --> 01:03:57.560
more of what was potentially kind of in the discourse or in our conversation than ever.

01:03:57.560 --> 01:04:03.080
Like Thanos wasn't wrong. He's like, Look, my planet got trashed. I concluded, right, then in

01:04:03.080 --> 01:04:07.720
order to save the universe had to kill half the people or something like that, right? Therefore,

01:04:07.720 --> 01:04:13.400
the Thanos snap. And then he got ostracized and he became the super scary bad guy, right?

01:04:13.400 --> 01:04:18.360
But he wasn't wrong. He's like, there's too many people for the carrying capacity of this ecosystem.

01:04:18.360 --> 01:04:21.960
And I think we get wildly more efficient, but don't succumb to the Javons paradox of just

01:04:21.960 --> 01:04:25.240
getting fatter and greedier and consuming more, right? But we actually get more efficient and

01:04:25.240 --> 01:04:30.440
consume the same or less. But we're not doing that. So I've got to take drastic measures

01:04:30.440 --> 01:04:35.000
to save things. But he's the villain. And you're like, Yeah, you had a point there.

01:04:35.080 --> 01:04:39.160
And Killmonger, who I don't quite remember his entire narrative, but I do remember it was

01:04:39.160 --> 01:04:46.120
fundamentally a sort of contemporary Malcolm X critique, right? There was that sense of like,

01:04:46.120 --> 01:04:52.920
hey, colonialism, hey, racism, hey, all of these things, it's a stacked deck. And to play within

01:04:52.920 --> 01:04:59.080
the system is kind of a fool's game. I need to break the system. And so you had many situations

01:04:59.080 --> 01:05:05.960
where the critiques of the antihero or the villain are actually expressing some real things

01:05:05.960 --> 01:05:09.720
for us to reckon with, whether or not we come down exactly where they did. It's just real issues

01:05:09.720 --> 01:05:21.640
and topics to reckon with. So to your point about, are we flawed? Are we bad? You know, is there

01:05:21.640 --> 01:05:29.800
something? I mean, to me, it seems very much like the, you know, the simple question is,

01:05:30.520 --> 01:05:37.480
is the way forwards? Or do we need to backtrack? You know, is there somewhere where we fell from

01:05:37.480 --> 01:05:42.600
grace? And therefore everything, if we keep going the way we've been going, we just sort of

01:05:42.600 --> 01:05:48.840
do them to carry out our original sin. Or do we need to slam on the brakes and go back to a fork

01:05:48.840 --> 01:05:54.280
in the road that we missed somewhere, right, to get back to righteousness, to get back to balance,

01:05:54.280 --> 01:05:59.160
to get back to whatever. And you definitely see that with like Yuval Harari's book sapiens.

01:05:59.800 --> 01:06:04.600
And I think most people were probably just sort of, you know, overwhelmed and bedazzled by,

01:06:04.600 --> 01:06:10.680
you know, big history kind of take. So they just kind of took it all in. But he, you know, he smuggles

01:06:10.680 --> 01:06:17.080
in some, you know, both totally familiar and some relatively controversial content, which is not

01:06:17.080 --> 01:06:23.160
the least of which is we were super groovy. This is Marshall Salem's anthropology hypothesis back

01:06:23.160 --> 01:06:28.200
in the late 60s of like, man, the hunter gatherer had like had more free time, right? It was egalitarian

01:06:28.200 --> 01:06:34.520
societies. It was, it, we were, they were healthier. Everything was groovy. And then big time bad

01:06:34.520 --> 01:06:42.440
farming came along. Right. And, and Harari just dusted that chest nut off and completely rebooted

01:06:42.520 --> 01:06:47.480
it for sapiens. And everyone's like, Oh, yeah. And if people remember far enough back, there was a

01:06:47.480 --> 01:06:53.160
very popular book in the 90s called Ishmael. And it was told by the point of view of a gorilla,

01:06:53.160 --> 01:06:57.480
who was a talking gorilla. And he was basically like, like all of civilization is broken down into

01:06:57.480 --> 01:07:01.880
levers and takers. And the levers are the groovy indigenous sustainable folks. And the takers are

01:07:01.880 --> 01:07:09.080
the kind of, you know, beginnings of white Western capitalist patriarchy. And it resonated,

01:07:09.080 --> 01:07:15.400
it sold millions of copies. And it was also, of course, grossly simplified. And those questions

01:07:15.400 --> 01:07:21.320
though, right, you know, and even in our conversations around something as heart wrenching

01:07:21.320 --> 01:07:28.280
and politically loaded as Gaza, and the Arab Israeli conflict right now, is being coded in

01:07:28.280 --> 01:07:35.080
these terms. Right. So you're seeing the fact that on, you know, anti semitism has been a big

01:07:35.160 --> 01:07:41.640
question, right? A big, a big issue both in US universities, like Columbia and Harvard and Penn,

01:07:42.520 --> 01:07:47.320
as well as a bunch of other places, it's occupying tons of column inches. And it's also

01:07:47.320 --> 01:07:55.640
completely gumming up our abilities to look clearly at a geopolitical crisis. And whose side

01:07:55.640 --> 01:07:59.160
is on what and what's going on? Because, you know, one of the things just one second,

01:07:59.720 --> 01:08:05.880
like, dude, I don't even know if I want to go into this. Do you want to? I mean, it's tight,

01:08:05.880 --> 01:08:09.880
but it's just if we want it, it just depends on this is this is an absolute rats in

01:08:09.880 --> 01:08:13.000
Islam. And I'm not going to be advocating a personal opinion on it, but I'm going to

01:08:13.960 --> 01:08:19.400
potentially just unpack that whole tribalism, capitalism, colonialism thing.

01:08:20.680 --> 01:08:23.400
That sounds great. Yeah. Is that all right? I mean, it sounds

01:08:24.920 --> 01:08:27.480
like a great idea. Let's hear it. Okay.

01:08:30.120 --> 01:08:37.160
So quite a bit of the, I mean, obviously, there's a tragic humanitarian situation

01:08:38.200 --> 01:08:45.080
in Gaza right now and in Ukraine and in Darfur and in many places in the world. So Sub-Saharan

01:08:45.080 --> 01:08:52.280
Africa is, you know, is on fire. There's all sorts of sadness and loss of life happening there.

01:08:53.640 --> 01:08:57.480
Obviously, we've been tracking Ukraine for the last couple of years and most recently and

01:09:00.040 --> 01:09:03.000
sort of explosively and controversially what's happening in Gaza.

01:09:04.600 --> 01:09:15.800
Part of the support for Palestinians has been coded as Israelis as colonizers.

01:09:17.240 --> 01:09:25.080
And that has then sort of activated the meme complex of social justice,

01:09:25.720 --> 01:09:33.880
post-Marxist academic critiques in the United States. So when they get accused of anti-Semitism,

01:09:34.920 --> 01:09:43.080
it's a relatively new kind of anti-Semitism, right? It's Jews as coded as white,

01:09:44.600 --> 01:09:51.640
coded as colonizers, and colonizers are always bad and colonized,

01:09:52.360 --> 01:09:57.480
a.k.a. Franz Fanon, you know, and Wretched of the Earth and Blackskins White Mask and other,

01:09:57.480 --> 01:10:02.840
you know, other academics and thinkers in that space. And Mark Hughes and some others, which,

01:10:02.840 --> 01:10:07.880
by the way, went straight into Ibram Kendi's philosophy of like, you know, you know, basically,

01:10:07.880 --> 01:10:15.800
the cure to, you know, the, or the solution or response to racism is anti-racism directed at

01:10:15.800 --> 01:10:21.400
the racists, right? So you ended up with some of those very tight arguments. So we end up with the

01:10:21.400 --> 01:10:29.720
emergence of a new type of anti-Semitism, which is, which is coding Jews and specifically Israeli

01:10:29.720 --> 01:10:35.800
Jews as white, as colonizers. Now, at the same time, which is very weird, because that's typically

01:10:35.800 --> 01:10:40.120
that pro-Palestinian supporters coming from the progressive left, which has almost always been,

01:10:41.080 --> 01:10:46.360
you know, huge supporters of ethnic diversity and inclusion. And then historically, the entire

01:10:46.360 --> 01:10:53.400
American civil rights movement in the sixties was hand in glove Jewish college students and

01:10:53.400 --> 01:10:59.400
Southern blacks. And that was a coalition and alliance. You know, and on the, on the far side,

01:10:59.400 --> 01:11:06.840
on the right was the Ku Klux Klan, right, who famously, you know, were against reconstruction

01:11:06.840 --> 01:11:12.280
and against black voting rights and participation and citizenship, but hot on the heels of that

01:11:12.280 --> 01:11:19.640
hit list for the Klan were Catholics and Jews, right? So you're like, oh, wait a sec. Now,

01:11:19.640 --> 01:11:28.200
how is it that now the American right seems to be the staunchest supporter of Israeli practices

01:11:28.200 --> 01:11:37.240
and policies, right? When just 40 odd years ago, they were the ones who were most, most anti-Semitic

01:11:37.240 --> 01:11:43.480
and that was a totally different anti-Semitism. That is Jews as other. So you've got Jews as

01:11:43.480 --> 01:11:47.560
cultural other. And this is the protocol, you know, the protocols of the elders of Zion. This is

01:11:47.560 --> 01:11:52.440
all the classic anti-Semitic tropes of Jews as separate Jews as not bowing down to our same

01:11:52.440 --> 01:11:57.800
gods and the Jews as not, not loyal to the country or the nation that they live in, etc. It's all

01:11:57.800 --> 01:12:05.240
the old school ethnic anti-Semitism, right? Where on the left, you have political anti-Semitism.

01:12:05.240 --> 01:12:11.480
They're two completely different anti-Semitism, right? But they still end up in the chaos. And

01:12:11.480 --> 01:12:17.480
then you think, okay, in that meme complex, right? What is the sort of elephant under the rug or

01:12:17.480 --> 01:12:25.080
not even under the rug, right? With all coding or understanding of Jewishness. It's the Holocaust

01:12:25.800 --> 01:12:31.240
and never again. Now you go onto the Palestinian side of the fence and you have,

01:12:32.200 --> 01:12:38.520
you know, what's, what's the, what's the memetic anchor? 9-11 and ISIS. And all the way back to

01:12:38.520 --> 01:12:43.400
the Crusades, right? But the idea of like, somewhere in there, you're having to respond to and either

01:12:43.400 --> 01:12:49.560
accept or reject the notion of barbarism, of which October the 7th, tragically and sadly,

01:12:50.120 --> 01:12:57.400
with Hamas's activities, reinvigorated. And now you end up with, with Palestinians coded as

01:12:58.040 --> 01:13:05.000
colonized, therefore always just in their reactions against, oh, but what about Muslim

01:13:05.000 --> 01:13:10.680
barbarism? Samuel Huntington, clash of civilizations, Sam Harris, right? With his railing against

01:13:10.680 --> 01:13:15.480
Islam and saying, hey, you know, Islam didn't experience a Protestant, the equivalent of a

01:13:15.480 --> 01:13:20.120
Protestant Reformation. They're basically a medieval death cult. You know, Sam Harris has, has been

01:13:20.120 --> 01:13:26.440
quite adamant on some of those points. So you can kind of see both the meme map and how the

01:13:26.440 --> 01:13:34.200
different characters in the plots are getting coded. And it's very, very confusing because we're

01:13:34.200 --> 01:13:41.160
all running different scripts. And so we're not even seeing the same movie anymore. And therefore,

01:13:41.160 --> 01:13:47.960
coming to any kind of humanitarian company, you know, and or, you know, governmental common ground

01:13:48.600 --> 01:13:53.960
is damn near impossible. And the same thing is even happening in the environmental movement. I

01:13:53.960 --> 01:13:58.200
occasionally have advised Extinction Rebellion, which was kind of, which came up with Greta Thunberg

01:13:58.200 --> 01:14:03.160
and some of those others, they've led some of the most effective protests in 2018 to 2020.

01:14:03.160 --> 01:14:07.480
And speaking with one of their founders, they're like, oh, well, you know, post George Floyd,

01:14:07.480 --> 01:14:13.560
post quarantine, post all of those, those sort of social justice awakenings collectively, they're

01:14:13.560 --> 01:14:19.640
like, we're not going to do anything until we've decolonized Africa. I mean, I'm paraphrasing,

01:14:19.640 --> 01:14:24.440
but it was fundamentally that. And I just thought, oh, no, you know, like, you're one,

01:14:24.440 --> 01:14:29.640
like, you're done, you're dead in the water, like, like, like, like, you've now got way too many

01:14:29.640 --> 01:14:33.960
issues, you're just trying to solve the world and tire pain and all injustices everywhere,

01:14:33.960 --> 01:14:40.120
while the clock is ticking on, you know, carbon and anything else. But what's really interesting to

01:14:40.120 --> 01:14:45.800
me is, you know, and this is somewhat of a theme of our conversation, which is waking up and paying

01:14:45.800 --> 01:14:52.600
attention to the enormity scope and scale of the world's suffering, the consequences of our

01:14:52.600 --> 01:14:59.400
extended actions, and the potential grief of coming to terms with kind of the triaging of what's

01:14:59.400 --> 01:15:07.880
possible and what's not. And what is delicate, fragile, wounded, but vital to protect, preserve

01:15:07.960 --> 01:15:14.440
meant. What is kind of already done, it's cooked. So just basically cut our losses

01:15:15.000 --> 01:15:19.480
and don't burn more time trying to fix something or prop something up that is fundamentally doomed.

01:15:20.120 --> 01:15:26.760
And then what is new or different or better that we ought to with absolute clarity and speed

01:15:28.680 --> 01:15:36.440
get to making or building soon. So in that, right, in our civilizational calculus,

01:15:36.440 --> 01:15:43.240
you're kind of like, how did we end up here? And where did we go wrong? I actually had this

01:15:43.240 --> 01:15:47.880
thought watching Darren Aronofsky, the director's moat, I don't know if it's his most recent,

01:15:47.880 --> 01:15:52.200
but it was a recent documentary he did called The Territory, which is all about a relatively

01:15:52.200 --> 01:15:57.240
uncontacted tribe in the Amazon. And it was just literally like this patch of rainforest that was

01:15:57.240 --> 01:16:01.080
their territory. And it was shrinking and shrinking and shrinking and getting chopped on all sides.

01:16:01.720 --> 01:16:08.200
And the first thing that blew me away about is that it was billed as here is this self-documentary

01:16:08.200 --> 01:16:12.520
by a sort of an uncontacted tribe. And so I was like, okay, this is going to be neat. This is going

01:16:12.520 --> 01:16:19.080
to be like that Robert Neera movie, The Mission with the Guarani or some other tribe from centuries

01:16:19.080 --> 01:16:23.880
ago. And it wasn't the first thing was they were all wearing like O'Neill and Bill Among and Nike

01:16:23.880 --> 01:16:29.880
t-shirts. And you're like, oh, sweet Jesus, like there they are wearing, of course they would dress

01:16:29.960 --> 01:16:35.320
up in their ceremonial gob for a video shoot or doing a ceremony. But like fundamentally they're

01:16:35.320 --> 01:16:40.680
kicking it in flip flops and branded Western logo t-shirts. And you're like, oh my God,

01:16:40.680 --> 01:16:45.800
like that all reaches. And then they interviewed the white settlers that were being aided and

01:16:45.800 --> 01:16:50.840
abetted by Bolsonaro's policies. And they were interviewing the younger generation of chiefs,

01:16:50.840 --> 01:16:55.400
their chief, their newly appointed chief was like a 30 year old. And he was online and tech savvy,

01:16:55.400 --> 01:16:58.920
and he was part of the one who was shooting and telling their stories. So super interesting,

01:16:59.000 --> 01:17:05.400
kind of intersections of cultures. And nobody interviewed on either side of that situation

01:17:05.400 --> 01:17:09.720
thought that they had any chance of turning back the tide of logging, settlement,

01:17:10.280 --> 01:17:16.680
cattle farming, ranching, deforestation, you know, and cultural assimilation, assimilation. And even

01:17:17.400 --> 01:17:23.720
last week, there was a New York Times article on a do-gooder white Christian woman, you know,

01:17:23.720 --> 01:17:30.440
for whatever it was, from Kansas or Oklahoma, who had written a check to get 14 starlings

01:17:31.480 --> 01:17:37.640
delivered to a remote tribe. And the whole hope was this could let them know when bad folks were

01:17:37.640 --> 01:17:41.320
coming, whether it was oil or rubber or gas or for ranching and protect themselves, they could

01:17:41.320 --> 01:17:45.080
coordinate, they could have better medical care, all the normal things. What happened is it completely

01:17:45.080 --> 01:17:49.960
broke their society in six months flat. The kid, the men go all got addicted to porn. The teenagers

01:17:49.960 --> 01:17:54.120
got stuck on their phones and stopped coming to meetings and stopped coming observing ceremonies

01:17:54.120 --> 01:17:58.600
and the grandparents were scattered and fragmented. And at the end of all that, they're like,

01:17:58.600 --> 01:18:04.440
and please don't take it away. So that got me deeply thinking, I'm like, Oh my God,

01:18:04.440 --> 01:18:13.320
what is this sort of mollic notion? What is this giant, all devouring, all consuming beast that

01:18:13.320 --> 01:18:22.120
just seems to be unstoppable? And how on earth do we reckon with it? And what occurred to me is

01:18:22.120 --> 01:18:30.520
that, you know, capitalism is arguably one of the most efficient means of organizing matter

01:18:30.520 --> 01:18:37.640
and energy that humans have ever devised in the simplest sense that it just continues to outcompete

01:18:37.640 --> 01:18:42.520
all the other options. So you have to be like, okay, there's some there, there, however, but on

01:18:42.520 --> 01:18:47.560
the other hand, look at the social, cultural, ecological cost is clearly not totally right.

01:18:47.560 --> 01:18:52.440
Like there's something also deeply off about it. In what does it relentlessly keep doing?

01:18:53.080 --> 01:18:57.160
And that's when I began to kind of inquire into, Oh, what is the, what is the calculus?

01:18:57.160 --> 01:19:01.480
What is our civilizational calculus? What is the math problem or the math equation

01:19:02.120 --> 01:19:08.440
that drives all of our behaviors? And what are we missing? You know, is there something in this

01:19:08.440 --> 01:19:13.800
equation that it works, but it's missing key elements. And I began to wonder, and this goes

01:19:13.800 --> 01:19:19.080
back to Gaza and the questions of antisemitism and colonialism and coding as whiteness. This goes

01:19:19.080 --> 01:19:23.080
back to the environmental movements, and we have to decolonize the world and all of these elements.

01:19:23.080 --> 01:19:29.560
And how are we fighting? And why do we keep over consuming like hungry ghosts? So it felt to me

01:19:29.560 --> 01:19:36.040
like there were three major sort of phases. And this is in, this is kind of in order as to how

01:19:36.040 --> 01:19:41.160
they unfolded historically, but none of them have ever unfolded in isolation from the others.

01:19:41.160 --> 01:19:48.520
So they keep building on each other. So the first is tribalism, then colonialism, then capitalism.

01:19:49.400 --> 01:19:55.160
And each of them has sort of, you know, natural intuitive logic as to why they exist and also

01:19:55.160 --> 01:20:00.840
problems. And if we can figure out and solve for their problems, we might, might have a chance at

01:20:00.840 --> 01:20:07.400
a slightly more healthy and sustainable civilization. So the first and most obvious is tribalism.

01:20:08.040 --> 01:20:13.960
And its externality, the thing it doesn't include, right, is others. It's us versus them.

01:20:14.600 --> 01:20:20.120
So it's a sort of, it's a social externality. There's the us, and we are literally quite often,

01:20:20.120 --> 01:20:25.240
I mean, so many indigenous peoples own name for themselves. It's just the people, you know,

01:20:25.240 --> 01:20:28.920
it's usually like in history books, it becomes, you know, they get called where the, whether it's

01:20:28.920 --> 01:20:33.480
the Sue or the Iroquois or whomever it might be, it's typically their enemies call them that names

01:20:33.480 --> 01:20:38.360
or the ones that became scouts or, you know, or collaborators with the Westerners get to name

01:20:38.360 --> 01:20:43.320
the people. But the people is almost always the people, it's us. And we are right and good and

01:20:43.320 --> 01:20:49.240
true. And everybody who's a part of our community is entitled to all the rights of our society and

01:20:49.240 --> 01:20:53.480
how we operate. But if you live across the river, if you worship different gods, if you look funny,

01:20:53.480 --> 01:20:59.640
talks funny, smell funny, right, you're them. And you are not the people and you are not like we

01:20:59.640 --> 01:21:04.680
are not obliged to treat you the way we treat each other at all. And this is the barbarian,

01:21:04.680 --> 01:21:11.080
this is the heretic, this is the apostate, right, this is the pagan, whatever it might be. So we get

01:21:11.080 --> 01:21:15.720
to in the game of energy credits of like how do we move through this world and secure enough

01:21:15.720 --> 01:21:21.400
resources to keep us alive and thriving, right, we don't have to extend that to you. We are not,

01:21:21.400 --> 01:21:27.160
we are not the other's keeper, we are just our brother's keeper. So the externality is us versus

01:21:27.160 --> 01:21:33.480
them. Right. And it works. It's literally from a mother parent and mother child bond to family bonds

01:21:33.480 --> 01:21:40.840
to clan, you know, to tribe to clan to band to tribe to nation. That's how we do it. And tribalism

01:21:40.840 --> 01:21:46.280
these days has been politicized into nation nationalism. Right. So it's still that same

01:21:46.280 --> 01:21:53.400
through line, but it's ancient, ancient, ancient. The next is colonialism. Right. And colonialism

01:21:53.400 --> 01:22:00.120
you could basically just say is asymmetric trade at the point of a sword. Right. So when you've got

01:22:00.120 --> 01:22:05.960
tribes us versus them, there's still kind of thems that are closer to us than the then total

01:22:05.960 --> 01:22:11.000
wildcards total barbarians. And there are neighbors, right, those are bloodlines, those are

01:22:11.000 --> 01:22:15.000
intermarriage, those are geographic proximity, there's all those things and we trade with them.

01:22:15.640 --> 01:22:18.760
All right. And you've got some cool stuff and we might specialize or we live closer to the

01:22:18.760 --> 01:22:23.000
coast and you guys live in the forest or whatever it might be. And through extended trading networks

01:22:23.000 --> 01:22:29.800
that are mostly balanced and reciprocal, we exchange goods and services and again, you know,

01:22:29.800 --> 01:22:35.640
marriages into intermarriage and relationships and kinship ties. So that's trade. And that is

01:22:35.640 --> 01:22:42.760
an enormous layer of human cultural extension and vitality and vibrancy. It raises the quality

01:22:42.760 --> 01:22:46.200
of life of everyone who participates in it. Right. I mean, there are there are there are

01:22:46.200 --> 01:22:50.920
examples of cowrie shells in the Great Plains, you know, that have made it thousands of miles

01:22:50.920 --> 01:22:55.160
through trade networks to there. There's Pemicon, which is a sort of basically a super duper

01:22:55.160 --> 01:22:59.400
trail mix with either bear fat and grease or salmon and berries and things done in the Pacific

01:22:59.400 --> 01:23:02.920
Northwest that also made it to the Lakota and other and the Comanche and other places. You're

01:23:02.920 --> 01:23:07.320
like, oh my gosh, sir, like the world has always been wildly interconnected, the Silk Route, all

01:23:07.320 --> 01:23:14.520
of that kind of stuff. And but then when it ceases to be reciprocal and it becomes asymmetrical

01:23:15.160 --> 01:23:22.760
and enforced by force, that's when you get colonialism. And the externality there is here,

01:23:23.320 --> 01:23:28.680
AKA the country with the power or the tribe with the power versus there, we're going to chop down

01:23:28.680 --> 01:23:32.520
your trees, we're going to hunt your beaver, we're going to enslave your people, we're going to dig

01:23:32.520 --> 01:23:38.200
up your gold and silver and shiny things and we're going to take them from there over to here.

01:23:38.760 --> 01:23:43.080
Right. And it's that great line at the end of the godfather, which was Honoré de Balzac,

01:23:43.080 --> 01:23:50.200
but he said behind every great fortune lies a theft. And that's pretty much the bumper sticker

01:23:50.200 --> 01:23:56.120
for colonialism. Right. And even to this day, where whether it's the Elgin marbles or various,

01:23:56.120 --> 01:24:00.920
you know, the British Royal museums are stocked with loot from other countries and these other

01:24:00.920 --> 01:24:04.440
countries are now self aware enough and politically active enough. And in case they're like, we'd

01:24:04.440 --> 01:24:09.720
like our shit back, you know, and James Cameron, not James Cameron, sorry, David Cameron,

01:24:10.840 --> 01:24:14.200
and other British politicians have been like, yeah, well, I mean, if we gave it all back,

01:24:14.200 --> 01:24:17.640
we'd have nothing in our museum. So we're not giving we're not giving it back. And you're kind

01:24:17.640 --> 01:24:24.200
of like, oh, my gosh, that is really as pronounced an example of here versus there externalities

01:24:24.200 --> 01:24:29.080
as you could think of. And then the final one is capitalism. This kind of gets us back to

01:24:29.640 --> 01:24:36.600
Aronofsky and the territory and sort of what is this giant all consuming machine. And capitalism,

01:24:36.600 --> 01:24:45.800
its externality is now versus later. We will always take the profit now this month, this quarter,

01:24:45.800 --> 01:24:53.640
this year, we will always over fish over hunt over log over farm over grays, because to extract the

01:24:53.640 --> 01:25:00.040
profit now, more to the point to not extract the profit now is goes against everything we believe,

01:25:00.040 --> 01:25:07.880
including legally enforceable penalties, right, Milton Friedman, the economist famously advanced

01:25:07.880 --> 01:25:13.960
first in a New York Times article, and then in like 1971 or 72 of just like the sole purpose of

01:25:13.960 --> 01:25:18.680
a company should be just to maximize shareholder profits. And that was just him thinking out

01:25:18.680 --> 01:25:24.520
loud. It was an op ed in the magazine on a Sunday. And it wasn't until like 1985 or 1986,

01:25:24.520 --> 01:25:30.120
where the Revlon shampoo company was going to be hostile, he bought out and they and their

01:25:30.120 --> 01:25:33.720
board members tried to sue to prevent it because they're like, we're going to be bought out by this

01:25:33.720 --> 01:25:37.560
cheap ass five and dime store that's just going to gut us for parts and ruin our brain and we want

01:25:37.560 --> 01:25:43.800
to block the sale. And so mid 80s was when it actually got enshrined in federal law. No, no,

01:25:43.800 --> 01:25:50.360
actually, Friedman was right. sole responsibility of shareholders is to maximize profits. So that

01:25:50.360 --> 01:25:55.160
opened up the whole Gordon Gekko greed is good 1980s, like with the hostile takeovers and leverage

01:25:55.160 --> 01:26:01.880
buyouts and all of that. It also forced John Mackie to sell Whole Foods to Amazon, because he

01:26:01.880 --> 01:26:07.400
was getting he was being strong on by a venture capital fund that earned 8% earned 8% of Whole

01:26:07.400 --> 01:26:11.320
Foods and was going to basically gut them for parts because all of the inefficiencies in their

01:26:11.320 --> 01:26:15.160
business like supporting organic farmers and having healthy policies for their for their

01:26:15.160 --> 01:26:19.880
employees, all of that was just wasn't was not justifying. And that's how he ended up having

01:26:19.880 --> 01:26:25.720
to sell to Amazon. And it's also what prompted the Twitter board to accept Elon Musk's wildly

01:26:25.720 --> 01:26:29.480
overpriced offer for Twitter, even though they were deeply concerned as to what he was going to

01:26:29.480 --> 01:26:34.440
do about it, because they because basically they were as members as members of the board,

01:26:34.440 --> 01:26:40.760
they were fiduciarily responsible and subject to being sued. If they hadn't accepted that wildly

01:26:40.760 --> 01:26:45.640
overpriced offer for Twitter, which if you were an old school lover of Twitter, and you really

01:26:45.640 --> 01:26:49.720
cared for and cherished the way Jack Dorsey and the others had built the thing and what that

01:26:49.720 --> 01:26:54.280
community and cultural, you know, you might have been right to see this as coming destruction.

01:26:54.920 --> 01:27:01.640
But they had to say yes, no matter what their personal feelings were. So capitalism is always

01:27:01.640 --> 01:27:06.440
eating your seed corn, right? The idea of like typically right farmers will always want to save

01:27:07.240 --> 01:27:11.720
corn to then plant for the next harvest. If you eat your seed corn because you're too hungry in

01:27:11.720 --> 01:27:15.560
the winter and you didn't plan right, then you've got nothing to plant the next year and then you're

01:27:15.560 --> 01:27:22.280
doubly triply out of luck. So if you take a look at those three things, tribalism, the externality

01:27:22.280 --> 01:27:30.280
is them at the expense of us, or us, sorry, us at the expense of them. Colonialism is there,

01:27:30.840 --> 01:27:36.760
or Jesus Christ. Colonialism is here at the expense of there. And capitalism

01:27:38.040 --> 01:27:45.960
is now at the expense of later. So a tidy integration of those things is to say how

01:27:45.960 --> 01:27:51.800
would we fix the math so that our civilizational calculus actually spits out healthy, sustainable,

01:27:51.800 --> 01:27:58.520
equitable answers is to say instead of us versus them, right, it's everyone.

01:27:59.480 --> 01:28:08.440
Instead of here versus there, it's everywhere. And instead of now versus later, it's everyone.

01:28:09.880 --> 01:28:14.760
So if we built our civilizational calculus, instead of having all these externalities,

01:28:14.760 --> 01:28:19.720
right, that other people and other places and other times have to get stuck with the bill,

01:28:20.840 --> 01:28:25.240
right, get bankrupted, if we could all settle on everyone everywhere, everyone

01:28:25.240 --> 01:28:32.680
is how we choose to make decisions going forward. We would have a shot at making the most of the

01:28:32.680 --> 01:28:39.400
tools, the very deep structural cultural tools we have of tribalism, trade, right, and commerce

01:28:39.400 --> 01:28:47.640
and innovation and bundle them together in ways that don't keep spitting out pathological or dysfunctional

01:28:47.720 --> 01:28:56.040
answers. That was beautifully presented. And once again, I'm going to have to review what you

01:28:56.040 --> 01:29:02.600
just said and think on it over and over again. You have an amazing way of just putting these

01:29:02.600 --> 01:29:08.840
very complex ideas together. And I'm scribbling down notes so fast that my paper is catching

01:29:08.840 --> 01:29:17.640
on fire here. But I'm wondering, can these three levels, the colonization, the capitalism and the

01:29:17.640 --> 01:29:23.640
tribalism, could that be solved on an individual level? Or is this something that a third party

01:29:23.640 --> 01:29:33.160
system needs to come in and fix? Well, I mean, gosh, that is such a massive question. I think

01:29:33.160 --> 01:29:42.280
the simplest is there's so much inertia behind all of these things that individual change is

01:29:42.280 --> 01:29:49.880
sort of necessary, but not sufficient. And that is, and again, in the same way that that

01:29:49.880 --> 01:29:53.960
environmental cosnets curve, the idea of like, oh, the way forward is faster because, you know,

01:29:53.960 --> 01:29:58.920
advanced societies pollute less, but we really kind of want to just hear that so we don't scrutinize

01:29:58.920 --> 01:30:05.800
it too much as to how it's consistently true is that notion. The idea that change comes from within,

01:30:05.800 --> 01:30:11.560
and if I want to heal the world, I have to work first to heal myself, becomes an incredible bit

01:30:11.560 --> 01:30:17.880
of motivated reasoning to just shove my head all the way up my ass in a bunch of narcissistic

01:30:17.880 --> 01:30:25.000
personal growth and self-help, which is without a doubt just a part of neoliberal capture of

01:30:25.000 --> 01:30:30.520
fragmented, isolated consumer individuals scratching all the itches that get agitated

01:30:30.520 --> 01:30:35.720
via the constant barrage of marketing messages of quick fixes and easy hits and utopian outcomes.

01:30:36.280 --> 01:30:42.360
So in that level, it is sort of again, yes, of course, if you come from hate, you will so hate,

01:30:43.000 --> 01:30:47.720
you know, you plant ice, you're going to harvest wind, right? So there is some element of interior

01:30:47.720 --> 01:30:54.040
change. And if you look at the largest, most, you know, high impact change agents, at least in the last,

01:30:54.040 --> 01:31:00.280
you know, few decades from Nelson Mandela to Gandhi to King to kind of the usual suspects,

01:31:00.840 --> 01:31:06.600
they all were coming from a fundamentally different frequency than the tribal people they led.

01:31:07.240 --> 01:31:11.400
And Malcolm X as well, right? And Fred Hampton, there's a number of instances where

01:31:12.360 --> 01:31:20.360
that those leaders were clearly vibrating, you know, on a different frequency than the

01:31:20.360 --> 01:31:27.000
center of gravity of the people they inspired and fundamentally led. So a huge, you know,

01:31:27.000 --> 01:31:33.240
hat tip and acknowledgement to the power of transformational consciousness and its ability

01:31:33.800 --> 01:31:41.160
to set a tone that otherwise a bunch of disorganized, fractious primates would never get to in a

01:31:41.160 --> 01:31:45.000
million years. I often think of it like we used to live in Santa Barbara and there was this

01:31:45.000 --> 01:31:51.240
historic Sunday sunset drum circle on the beach. And our music teacher, who was this brilliant

01:31:51.880 --> 01:32:03.560
Sarod and Satara player, he and his crew of Tabla and Gembe and Conga players would often be there

01:32:03.560 --> 01:32:07.560
and they would be the core of the drum circle. And you'd go on those nights and that drum circle

01:32:07.560 --> 01:32:13.560
was tear the roof off funky, right, with hundreds of people like huge energy pulsing. And the thing

01:32:13.560 --> 01:32:18.840
was amazing. And then they would be on tour. And you go down there on that weekend. And there was

01:32:18.840 --> 01:32:23.720
nobody who was deeply, deeply talented gifted in the center of that drum circle. And it would be a

01:32:23.720 --> 01:32:30.280
noodley, mushy hippie shit show. And so you do kind of think like, Oh, who's the metronome? Who's

01:32:30.280 --> 01:32:37.080
the timekeeper? Because it's far easier. Like it takes a field to hold a field. It takes somebody's

01:32:37.080 --> 01:32:43.080
coherent energy to then bring everybody into that. It's far easier to follow a good beat

01:32:43.080 --> 01:32:50.040
than it is to hold one yourself if you're not trained. The flip side is, is that in order for

01:32:50.040 --> 01:32:57.000
us to sort of quote unquote, fix at a societal level, or at a global level, the other element.

01:32:57.000 --> 01:33:04.360
So tribalism is just, you know, basically after oxytocin, you know, which bonds mother to child

01:33:04.360 --> 01:33:10.440
and, and, you know, tribe to tribe, everything and everything is optional. So all of our humanist

01:33:10.520 --> 01:33:13.960
elements, all of our efforts to say, Hey, that person on the other side of the world that I

01:33:13.960 --> 01:33:18.040
don't know, that doesn't worship the same cause, that doesn't speak the same language or eat the

01:33:18.040 --> 01:33:24.280
same foods, and I'll never meet again, is entitled to something intrinsically human as am I? Like

01:33:24.280 --> 01:33:30.680
that is an incredibly fragile experiment. And it is not encoded into our DNA, into our biology,

01:33:30.680 --> 01:33:36.360
into our neurochemistry, or even in any level of our survival and printing. Like I mean mine.

01:33:36.760 --> 01:33:43.240
Now, and next is our survival and printing. So everyone, everywhere, everyone is Bodhisattva

01:33:44.120 --> 01:33:51.400
level awareness, and it's fragile. But as far as like helping like colonialism, you know,

01:33:51.400 --> 01:33:57.000
the idea of extraction of the point of a sword, that can for sure be, you know, quote unquote,

01:33:57.000 --> 01:34:04.680
fixed in the simple sense of acknowledging the originator of natural resources, goods, and services,

01:34:05.000 --> 01:34:13.080
and cutting them into the economic deal. I mean, the fact that in Nigeria, they are a net exporter

01:34:13.640 --> 01:34:20.280
of fossil fuels that then get refined, piped to Europe, refined and then sold back to them

01:34:20.280 --> 01:34:27.400
at a profit. You're like, that's, that's horribly, horribly wrong. And Sierra Leone, there was a

01:34:27.400 --> 01:34:35.720
very cool TED talk by a woman from Sierra Leone, being like, we're often, you know, labeled as one

01:34:35.720 --> 01:34:39.720
of the poorest countries in Africa, et cetera. We're not. And she talked about, you know, their

01:34:39.720 --> 01:34:43.160
mining assets, the diamonds, like all of these things, like here's our natural resources, we're

01:34:43.160 --> 01:34:50.280
we actually massively gifted in those terms, we've just been totally exploited. So fixing

01:34:50.280 --> 01:34:56.600
colonialism simply by not allowing rapacious multinational companies in cahoots with the IMF

01:34:56.600 --> 01:35:01.560
and World Bank and debt leveraged, you know, extortion, setting up terms and conditions that

01:35:01.560 --> 01:35:07.080
just siphon off natural resources. Let's just start with that. Never mind what would one do with 500

01:35:07.080 --> 01:35:11.320
years of reparations, like that's probably politically, economically feasible, you know,

01:35:11.320 --> 01:35:17.640
not feasible to sort in any meaningful way. But doing right by folks right now could be. And let's

01:35:17.640 --> 01:35:23.960
start with that. And then with capitalism, and Daniel Schmackenberger, Daniel Schmackenberger

01:35:23.960 --> 01:35:30.360
and I have actually had this conversation, because so many of his critiques lead to, oh,

01:35:30.360 --> 01:35:35.640
this is a self terminating system. Therefore, you have to get politicians to stop doing it.

01:35:35.640 --> 01:35:39.880
And I'm like, well, what politician in their right mind could say anything that you've just said,

01:35:40.600 --> 01:35:44.440
and not instantly be branded as a Marxist and instantly lose their term and office,

01:35:44.440 --> 01:35:48.440
and therefore all their access to influence, you know, so it would just be it would be career

01:35:48.440 --> 01:35:52.440
suicide, and then they wouldn't be on team good guy being able to affect any change. So we have to

01:35:52.520 --> 01:35:59.000
have something that splits the difference. And my personal feeling is that saying, you know,

01:35:59.000 --> 01:36:04.920
like the rallying cry of free the market, free the market. Capitalism is a great idea. It's just

01:36:04.920 --> 01:36:11.880
never been tried, right? It's always been monopolies, rent seeking, crony capitalism, subsidies,

01:36:11.880 --> 01:36:15.800
you know, like, like whether it's lobbyists or whatever it is, like, like it's that we've never

01:36:15.800 --> 01:36:23.480
actually had that, you know, classroom ideal of an economic a free love a frictionless

01:36:23.480 --> 01:36:27.400
exchange of good services with with dynamic pricing reflecting needs and values and all

01:36:27.400 --> 01:36:32.440
the things that you hear about an econ class have never actually been tried. So let's do that,

01:36:32.440 --> 01:36:36.920
let's free the market. And that's kind of your judo move of getting both conservatives and

01:36:36.920 --> 01:36:41.000
progressives on the same team, because you're not trying to break the entire system, you're just

01:36:41.000 --> 01:36:45.560
saying let's actually do the thing we said we were going to. Let's start with let's let's not

01:36:45.560 --> 01:36:50.120
even worry about universal basic income. Let's just have everybody pay their fair share.

01:36:51.160 --> 01:36:55.000
So whatever the tax code is right now, it could be wildly asymmetrical, it could be regressive,

01:36:55.000 --> 01:36:58.200
it could be a bunch of things, but right now there's so many loopholes and so many exceptions

01:36:58.200 --> 01:37:02.280
for the wealthiest folks, let's just have everybody pay their fair share. Let's just start with that.

01:37:03.160 --> 01:37:08.440
Let's abolish the 14th amendment, right, because the 14th amendment, which most people remember

01:37:08.440 --> 01:37:11.080
from high school is like, Oh, that's the one that freed the slaves, isn't it? That's a good one.

01:37:11.080 --> 01:37:18.280
You're like, Yeah, but weirdly, bizarrely, 20 years later, Leland Stanford, who founded Stanford

01:37:18.280 --> 01:37:25.320
University, and his his railroad, his lawyers, trying to wiggle out of some taxes, completely

01:37:25.320 --> 01:37:30.600
made up a complete fabrication that the 14th amendment really meant guaranteeing the rights

01:37:30.600 --> 01:37:34.680
of personhood to corporations as well. It's the craziest story you've ever heard because

01:37:35.240 --> 01:37:40.120
the Supreme Court has seen has judged like 280 cases or something since then,

01:37:40.120 --> 01:37:45.960
defending the right of corporations as persons, and only like 30 on actually the rights of Black

01:37:45.960 --> 01:37:51.960
folks as citizens. So it hijacked the entire thing, and has given us all of 20th and 21st

01:37:51.960 --> 01:37:58.520
century law on how much political power corporations have. Right, so you've got to

01:37:58.520 --> 01:38:03.240
banish, abolish that and the Friedman doctrine that the sole and exclusive responsibility

01:38:03.800 --> 01:38:09.400
of corporations is to extract maximum shareholder profit. If you don't do those things,

01:38:09.400 --> 01:38:15.880
you're dead in the water, right? Because the ratchets all go towards a governance system,

01:38:15.880 --> 01:38:21.960
a capitalization table, legally enforceable incentives, and court of law. I mean, there's

01:38:21.960 --> 01:38:26.440
situations now where because of that notion of corporations as persons, there are in

01:38:26.440 --> 01:38:33.560
international courts, nations are being sued by multinational corporations for daring to enact

01:38:33.560 --> 01:38:38.120
environmental policies that protect their streams, their rivers, their watersheds, their topsoil,

01:38:38.200 --> 01:38:43.400
and their people at the expense of maximum optimized profitability for the multinational

01:38:43.400 --> 01:38:50.040
corporation and the multinationals are winning. So you have situations like that and you're like,

01:38:50.040 --> 01:38:54.680
okay, that's a stitch up. That's not actually, doesn't matter how many do-gooders, doesn't

01:38:54.680 --> 01:38:59.080
matter how many, you know, Twitter campaigns or Instagrams, you know, social, you know, click,

01:38:59.080 --> 01:39:07.000
click and click and like, and follow the activists. None of that can work if the rule of law is so

01:39:07.640 --> 01:39:11.320
hijacked and compromised by these perverse incentives that are now legally enshrined.

01:39:12.200 --> 01:39:16.600
So back to your original question, can this be done on an individual level versus on a collective

01:39:16.600 --> 01:39:24.840
level? For sure, you know, we have to come from, you know, love, light, consciousness, inclusion,

01:39:24.840 --> 01:39:31.160
hopefully some joy, hopefully some play, right? Some sense of this is worth doing together, right?

01:39:31.160 --> 01:39:38.760
And there are absolutely technical, legal, structural conditions that until those are

01:39:38.760 --> 01:39:46.680
dislodged, right, they will, they will block and undermine even the best of intentions.

01:39:48.680 --> 01:39:55.160
That's a brilliant point. And I guess I lean more towards the individual side because I've

01:39:55.160 --> 01:39:58.840
lately, I've lost so much faith in our institutions and our governments,

01:39:59.480 --> 01:40:05.400
and I've seen the power of what an individual change can have on the world, you know, you

01:40:05.400 --> 01:40:11.720
change yourself, you change the world. And so like, to the tribalism, to the capitalism, colonialism

01:40:11.720 --> 01:40:17.160
on each of those levels, like, if the individual says, hey, I'm not, we're not going to support

01:40:17.160 --> 01:40:23.080
any products that have this chemical in it, we're done. The market is going to have to adjust,

01:40:23.160 --> 01:40:27.960
right? I mean, look how many people want organic food now, and are rejecting the pesticides.

01:40:27.960 --> 01:40:33.080
There's a huge demand for products that don't have plastic anymore, because people are now aware of

01:40:33.080 --> 01:40:38.280
how harmful phthalates are to our endocrine systems. You know, it's, it's because people are

01:40:38.280 --> 01:40:44.200
getting more aware that it's putting this demand on the companies, and the market has to adjust to

01:40:44.200 --> 01:40:51.080
that, that individual epiphany. And so you can apply that to colonialism and tribalism, like,

01:40:51.080 --> 01:40:56.920
if you realize that we're all one, and that anything that I do to hurt another person

01:40:56.920 --> 01:41:02.920
will hurt me in the end, and that by destroying the forest, I'm really just destroying myself.

01:41:04.440 --> 01:41:11.000
Those deep understandings can kind of make tribalism and colonialism deteriorate, I think.

01:41:11.720 --> 01:41:17.320
Maybe that's just like a, you know, that's a very utopian vision. But I do feel like I've seen

01:41:17.320 --> 01:41:24.600
people who have become, I guess, enlightened, not to sound cliche. And I've seen how much they,

01:41:24.600 --> 01:41:28.760
they step away from things that are harming the world, and how much good they can do,

01:41:29.640 --> 01:41:33.160
just one person, and how that spreads throughout a community.

01:41:35.480 --> 01:41:41.160
Yeah, absolutely. And to me, that almost lives in a, that lives in another and distinct and very,

01:41:41.240 --> 01:41:48.360
very important category, which is, and it's what I literally, it was the central thesis of the last

01:41:48.360 --> 01:41:53.400
book I wrote, Recapture the Rapture, which was, hey, look, all of our technical tactical solutions

01:41:54.120 --> 01:41:58.280
probably aren't going to pencil out, right? We're trying, we're bargaining, we're hoping,

01:41:58.280 --> 01:42:01.800
we're innovating, we're delaying, we're stalling, we're, you know, like all of it, like, it's just,

01:42:01.800 --> 01:42:08.760
it's a shit show, and the math doesn't work. But, right, there is this thing that happens

01:42:08.760 --> 01:42:13.240
once in a blue moon, and we talked about King Mandela Gandhi, but there's a lot of others,

01:42:13.240 --> 01:42:19.240
right? Where singular isolated acts of human love, creativity, and courage. I mean,

01:42:19.240 --> 01:42:24.840
Banksy is another example, like Banksy is just wildly on point almost all the time,

01:42:24.840 --> 01:42:30.440
and he's an anonymous artist that just does street art. But he's always like, hey, he's kind of like

01:42:30.440 --> 01:42:36.520
this cosmic prankster trickster, and he makes millions of humans think differently, right?

01:42:36.520 --> 01:42:41.320
Think about Tankman in Tiananmen Square, right, where he just stood in front of the tanks, he

01:42:41.320 --> 01:42:45.240
had shopping bags, he was tired, he just kind of come home from work, he didn't plan it, right?

01:42:45.240 --> 01:42:50.520
He's just like, fuck this, right? And then he was whisked off, spirited away, like no one knows

01:42:50.520 --> 01:42:55.080
what happened to him afterwards, and yet we all know who we're talking about, Tankman in Tiananmen

01:42:55.080 --> 01:43:01.000
Square, right? The cellist of Sarajevo in the midst of the Yugoslavian Civil War with all sorts of

01:43:01.000 --> 01:43:06.280
atrocities, in the bummed out rubble of Sarajevo, he just sat down on a chair and just played

01:43:07.480 --> 01:43:11.240
every night at sunset, and the snipers on both sides didn't kill him.

01:43:12.360 --> 01:43:18.920
Everybody was yearning for that glimpse of humanity, of beauty, in the midst of all of that

01:43:19.560 --> 01:43:28.120
horror, right? And he changed the tide of things, however slightly. You know, the example I always

01:43:28.120 --> 01:43:33.640
go back to is, you know, the band, you know, the band played on, on the Titanic, right? A string

01:43:33.640 --> 01:43:40.840
quartet who didn't scrap for those remaining seats in the lifeboats. They let the women and children

01:43:40.840 --> 01:43:47.880
go first, realized their goose was thoroughly cooked, and didn't just succumb to being panicky

01:43:47.880 --> 01:43:53.080
scared people. They said, what is our Dharma? What are we here to do? What are we given our lives to?

01:43:53.080 --> 01:43:57.240
And why were we here on this ship in the first place? It was because we are the musicians.

01:43:58.200 --> 01:44:01.240
And so, you know, Buddhism 101, seek refuge in the Dharma.

01:44:02.200 --> 01:44:06.120
They sought refuge in it, and the tune they played was, nearer my God to thee,

01:44:08.120 --> 01:44:11.480
right? So at a time where they could have succumbed to self-interest, where they could have

01:44:11.480 --> 01:44:16.920
been kicking and screaming, they could have been just in survival instincts. They instead

01:44:16.920 --> 01:44:21.400
elevated up. And we might not remember their names, but we remember what they did,

01:44:21.720 --> 01:44:28.680
and we tell those stories. You know, the more kind of agro macho one would be, you know,

01:44:28.680 --> 01:44:35.400
King Leonidas on the Spartans at Thermopylae, right? Against the Persian hordes, you know,

01:44:35.400 --> 01:44:39.960
and today, today we fight in the shade, right? Because there's that many arrows coming our way,

01:44:39.960 --> 01:44:47.080
like those acts of courage and heroism. Gandhi called it Satyagraha, which means truth force,

01:44:48.040 --> 01:44:53.320
when it made its way back to the United States via Howard Thurman to Martin Luther King, it became

01:44:53.320 --> 01:44:59.720
soul force. And MLK even mentions that in his I Have a Dream speech. He says, well, we can meet,

01:44:59.720 --> 01:45:04.360
when we can meet physical force through the majestic heights of soul force,

01:45:05.000 --> 01:45:09.560
right? Then we have a chance to turn things on a dime. And so that thought being is like, well, what

01:45:09.560 --> 01:45:19.800
if what if we could scale soul force? What if there are ways to have more humans, some tiny

01:45:19.800 --> 01:45:24.760
critical mass of people on Erica Chenoweth at the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard has

01:45:24.760 --> 01:45:29.240
famously pegged that at three and a half percent of a population, whether that's still true or

01:45:29.240 --> 01:45:33.560
deeply true, or you know, will be will be true playing forward, don't know. But let's just say

01:45:33.560 --> 01:45:38.680
we're not there yet. So let's get there and see how it looks from there. Right? What is the possibility

01:45:38.680 --> 01:45:46.520
of three and a half percent of humans accessing their own truth force, their own soul force,

01:45:46.520 --> 01:45:53.880
and then making just sending out that EMP of humanity, of courage, of truth,

01:45:54.760 --> 01:45:58.360
and just bearing witness to it and then like and then let the chips fall, right? It's not that those

01:45:58.360 --> 01:46:03.880
guys were fiddling on the Titanic in the hopes that the Coast Guard was going to hear them and

01:46:03.880 --> 01:46:10.440
pick them up. Right? They're like soul force is is my life is forfeit. None of us get out of here

01:46:10.440 --> 01:46:21.320
alive. I already I know this and accept it. Now what? Right? Now what? And that is where the beginning

01:46:21.320 --> 01:46:25.720
of something profound could happen. I mean, you know, and on a very tactical example,

01:46:25.720 --> 01:46:29.480
like a counterfactual, because you're like, Oh, three and a half percent of people being super

01:46:29.480 --> 01:46:31.880
groovy. Is that really going to change things? You're like, Well, actually, look at what happens

01:46:31.880 --> 01:46:37.320
when a tiny percentage of people are super shitty. So our friend Tristan Harris and Azar Askin at the

01:46:37.320 --> 01:46:41.960
Center for Humane Tech, they did the social dilemma that big documentary on social media ills

01:46:43.800 --> 01:46:49.880
found research that was basically saying that 90% of all social media of all generated social media

01:46:49.880 --> 01:46:59.320
that all of us read is created by 5% of the people on the furthest extremes. So 90% of social media

01:46:59.320 --> 01:47:03.400
is created by 10% of the humans, you know, half and half on either side of the political spectrum.

01:47:03.960 --> 01:47:09.560
And a subsequent study down in Australia found that those folks that are on the far extremes

01:47:10.120 --> 01:47:15.720
score off the charts for dark triad personality types and authoritarianism. So narcissism,

01:47:15.720 --> 01:47:23.720
sociopathy, Machiavellianism and authoritarianism are the 10% of the humans generating 90% of what

01:47:23.800 --> 01:47:29.240
we all read and view, which is absolutely insane because how many people scroll through their

01:47:29.240 --> 01:47:35.240
social media are like, I hate humans. We're screwed. You know, I don't want to be a part of this

01:47:35.240 --> 01:47:40.040
civilization or this society. It's a totally logical conclusion. It's just that it's not

01:47:40.600 --> 01:47:47.320
the 90% of the humans in the middle. 90% of the humans in the middle want a chance to live

01:47:47.960 --> 01:47:52.120
a better life than their parents had and give a better life to their kids and die in their sleep

01:47:52.120 --> 01:47:58.360
surrounded by their grandchildren. Like that has always been what most of us want.

01:47:59.560 --> 01:48:07.480
And so breaking through those false barriers, those algorithmically optimized notions of

01:48:07.480 --> 01:48:15.240
separation and frustration and getting back to mutuality and connection where we see each

01:48:15.240 --> 01:48:20.440
other's humanity and we recognize that there's something worth defending and protecting here

01:48:21.320 --> 01:48:25.960
does feel super important. So to your question, like surely, hey, is there something about the

01:48:25.960 --> 01:48:31.000
individual? It absolutely has to be done at this level. And there is something asymmetrically

01:48:31.000 --> 01:48:36.600
different than I'm just going to yoga and using my breath work app and my headspace and my ice

01:48:36.600 --> 01:48:42.120
bath. And this is all about me as a co-opted neoliberal capitalist consumer of late stage

01:48:42.120 --> 01:48:48.280
capitalism, right? Like that version doesn't go anywhere. That is a that is a insidious

01:48:48.280 --> 01:48:53.640
stall and diversion tactic of the people with the greatest privilege from their social civic

01:48:53.640 --> 01:49:00.520
political responsibilities. But stepping into the deeper prospect of what happens if a bunch of us,

01:49:01.160 --> 01:49:05.800
some critical mass of us actually access our soul force and take a stand and say enough is enough.

01:49:06.920 --> 01:49:09.880
I am here to bear witness to the least of my brothers and sisters,

01:49:11.000 --> 01:49:15.160
you know, on behalf of goodness, truth and beauty for as long as it takes.

01:49:15.560 --> 01:49:18.760
That feels like a game with playing.

01:49:21.400 --> 01:49:27.320
Absolutely. And I love how this conversation just flowed naturally. We we I haven't even gotten

01:49:27.320 --> 01:49:33.080
to my first question that I wrote down. No way. But but I love how this has just been an organic

01:49:33.080 --> 01:49:37.640
flow. The questions have just come naturally. But I think this leads into the first question

01:49:37.640 --> 01:49:43.080
that I wrote down. I've seen a incredible rise in cynicism. And I spent a lot of my time reading

01:49:43.080 --> 01:49:48.840
comments online. And it seems like that must suck. You know, I know it's a bad habit, but

01:49:50.520 --> 01:49:55.560
a lot of the comments I get on my channel are very genuine. You know, they're not not trolls.

01:49:56.120 --> 01:50:00.280
So I take most of them seriously into consideration. And, you know, I like,

01:50:00.920 --> 01:50:05.240
I get a lot of positive comments on my channels. I think it's rare, because a lot of the comments,

01:50:05.960 --> 01:50:10.920
a lot of the feedback is positive. But I've just just scrolling online, I see so much cynicism.

01:50:11.000 --> 01:50:15.160
And just even in the titles of videos, everything's kind of like, let's take something that

01:50:15.800 --> 01:50:18.360
most people think is good. And let's talk about how it's actually terrible.

01:50:19.320 --> 01:50:23.880
And I feel like there's so many takes like, if you want to make a viral video that gets a lot of

01:50:23.880 --> 01:50:28.280
attention, you just pick something that a lot of people think to be true. And then you say how

01:50:28.280 --> 01:50:35.080
it's false. You know, if I made a video right now that said AI is actually past its prime, it's peaked.

01:50:36.040 --> 01:50:40.920
Most people think that AI is advancing super fast. But if I make a take that's

01:50:41.480 --> 01:50:45.400
the opposite to what most people think, even if it's completely unfounded,

01:50:45.960 --> 01:50:49.960
that take is going to get a lot of attention. And I think a lot of content creators have

01:50:50.600 --> 01:50:55.640
kind of figured out that hack. And so they're just, the internet is flooded with these

01:50:56.760 --> 01:51:04.360
contrarian takes, you know what I'm saying? And I think it's led to people not knowing what's

01:51:04.360 --> 01:51:10.760
true anymore. And the natural response is just cynicism. And cynicism has gotten confused with

01:51:10.760 --> 01:51:18.680
intelligence. Like, even in movies, if you see somebody who's like, happy, go lucky, we think,

01:51:18.680 --> 01:51:25.080
oh, that person must be ignorant. And the person that's always like, very skeptical is seen as

01:51:25.080 --> 01:51:30.520
the intelligent one. So like this cynicism has been connected with intelligence and people,

01:51:30.600 --> 01:51:35.720
their natural response now is just to, okay, let me just not trust anything. Let me just

01:51:35.720 --> 01:51:40.440
think that everything's bad. Have you also noticed this rise in cynicism?

01:51:41.800 --> 01:51:50.680
Yeah, so I mean, the symbol answer is, is for sure. It does feel like there is a spike in,

01:51:51.960 --> 01:51:57.800
you know, nothing is true. Nothing is trustworthy. Even the thing, even our sacred cows,

01:51:57.800 --> 01:52:02.600
that we used to sort of think we're up and above that, like Abraham Lincoln and Thomas Jefferson

01:52:02.600 --> 01:52:06.840
and George Washington will actually turned out they were slaveholders or misogynists or something,

01:52:06.840 --> 01:52:10.840
you know, something along those lines, like, is there any one, is there any thing? And again,

01:52:10.840 --> 01:52:17.080
even back to, you know, enlightenment values, or the American experiment, you know, or whatever it

01:52:17.080 --> 01:52:25.080
might be, there's somebody taking a sledgehammer or a chisel to all of our, you know, monuments,

01:52:25.080 --> 01:52:28.680
to all of the edifices to the things that we have, we used to potentially, you know,

01:52:29.720 --> 01:52:34.920
accept more at face value. And we had spoken a little bit earlier about how things are getting

01:52:34.920 --> 01:52:39.400
exponentially better and exponentially worse at the same time. And that's overwhelming.

01:52:40.200 --> 01:52:44.520
So at the same time, that just, you know, everything from the complexities and the

01:52:44.520 --> 01:52:49.640
consequences of our current moment, which is just sort of objective, plus the massively

01:52:49.640 --> 01:52:53.400
accelerated amount of information we all have access to through our super smart smartphones,

01:52:53.400 --> 01:52:56.360
you know, constantly bombarding us at all times. And I read something that

01:52:57.000 --> 01:53:00.680
basically a Sunday edition of the New York Times, just as thick as that is,

01:53:01.480 --> 01:53:05.800
was as much information as a monk in the Middle Ages consumed in his lifetime.

01:53:08.040 --> 01:53:13.400
And we're getting that before breakfast every day. You know, it's, it's, it's, it's

01:53:13.400 --> 01:53:19.960
a certain bananas, right? So at the same time that we have this huge spike in both volume and

01:53:19.960 --> 01:53:26.840
consequence of the information we're consuming, we've had a loss in our familiar landmarks.

01:53:27.880 --> 01:53:33.080
And you can kind of say, you know, sort of meaning 1.0 was that notion of organized religion. And

01:53:33.080 --> 01:53:36.920
that was your sacred scriptures and your priests and your community rabbis, you know, imams in

01:53:36.920 --> 01:53:40.360
your community, they told you what was what they told you where you lived in the world and your

01:53:40.360 --> 01:53:43.560
universe and how to be and what to do, et cetera, et cetera. And if there was something weird,

01:53:43.560 --> 01:53:47.640
like a comet or a meteor or, you know, or a strange happening, you went to them and they

01:53:47.640 --> 01:53:53.080
told you what to think about it. So that was our overwhelming and dominant source of information

01:53:54.280 --> 01:54:00.680
until the last three, 400 years of increasingly the advent of modern liberalism and not meaning

01:54:00.680 --> 01:54:04.840
Democrat, but just meaning that the Enlightenment experiment, the combinations of science,

01:54:04.840 --> 01:54:09.240
of empiricism, of rule of law, of civil liberties and all of those kinds of things. And those are

01:54:09.240 --> 01:54:14.760
the institutions like everything from the CDC and the WHO, right, to the World Bank, to the

01:54:14.760 --> 01:54:20.120
United Nations, to, you know, Yale and Harvard and MIT and all of our institutions, to McKinsey

01:54:20.120 --> 01:54:27.080
and Goldman Sachs, right, like all of those kind of icons. And, you know, for the first time ever,

01:54:27.080 --> 01:54:32.840
we've had the collapse in both of those pillars at the same time that we're having this exponential

01:54:32.840 --> 01:54:39.160
complexity. So we're more in need of trusted and trustworthy voices to tell us which ends up

01:54:39.880 --> 01:54:45.800
at the same time that they've both collapsed. So the roof is kind of caved in on our separation of

01:54:45.800 --> 01:54:52.600
church and state, kind of modern liberal secular societies. And into that vacuum, you're getting

01:54:52.600 --> 01:54:59.080
people pulled to fundamentalism on one side, which is like, it's too big, it's too scary out there,

01:54:59.080 --> 01:55:04.360
just give me something, anything to sink my teeth into, believe a rock to cling to, just tell me

01:55:04.360 --> 01:55:12.600
what that might be. And on the other side, nihilism, like I give up, this is hopeless. There is no

01:55:12.600 --> 01:55:17.480
there, there, we are just in a cyclic creation and destruction, there is no higher purpose or power,

01:55:17.480 --> 01:55:23.400
there is no times arrow direction to where we're going. This is just more of the same shit. So

01:55:23.400 --> 01:55:28.440
your naming of the cynicism, you can make a case, either you put that in that in the nihilism bucket,

01:55:28.440 --> 01:55:33.000
it's just a flavor of that, right, or you could say that's somehow hanging out in the middle,

01:55:33.720 --> 01:55:40.600
you know, where you are sort of perversely incented to kick down anything anyone believes,

01:55:41.480 --> 01:55:46.520
right, because you have no faith that there's something more to be had. And cynicism and

01:55:46.520 --> 01:55:51.640
hedonism, I think, often pair together, right? If there's nothing, if there's no other better

01:55:51.640 --> 01:55:57.080
game to play, and I can go around kicking down everybody's sandcastles, then the only thing

01:55:57.080 --> 01:56:04.120
left to do is for me to get mine, right, seek pleasure, avoid pain, you know, and that might

01:56:04.120 --> 01:56:09.480
even be clicks and likes and trolling, that might be pleasurable to me. So, you know, and so that's

01:56:09.480 --> 01:56:16.360
not just sort of an abstract theoretical model, right, is it predictive? Does it help its mind?

01:56:16.360 --> 01:56:21.400
You're like, oh, look what's happening with fundamentalism, like not only are we seeing a

01:56:21.400 --> 01:56:26.840
resurgence in that in organized religions, but you're seeing some weird ass hybrids, you're seeing,

01:56:26.840 --> 01:56:32.200
you know, there was just a piece this about three months ago on the rise of orthobros,

01:56:32.840 --> 01:56:39.720
right, which was Eastern Orthodox Christian, you know, sort of Joe Rogan, podcaster, guns and

01:56:39.720 --> 01:56:45.480
steroid MMA guys, getting into Eastern Orthodoxy in Houston. So a huge, and they've even taken

01:56:45.480 --> 01:56:53.880
over the Eastern Orthodox communities in Houston, Texas. And a colleague of ours, Isabella, Tara

01:56:53.880 --> 01:56:59.080
Isabella Burton, who wrote a great book called Strange Rights, which is kind of everything from

01:56:59.080 --> 01:57:03.080
Burning Man and Soul Cycle to all these weird expressions of religiosity in the contemporary

01:57:03.080 --> 01:57:10.040
world. She's written in the New York Times about the the basically the return to extreme

01:57:10.040 --> 01:57:15.240
orthodoxies in Catholic like folks like young people, millennials are going in New York City

01:57:15.240 --> 01:57:20.520
are getting pulled into like Latin masses. They're like the older and the sort of more

01:57:20.520 --> 01:57:25.000
code based. And the more tell me what to do, the more I'm going to get off on it. It's almost

01:57:25.000 --> 01:57:30.920
like a sort of existential kink. It's a little bit like being a submissive in BDSM. It's like

01:57:30.920 --> 01:57:37.480
I've just spent a decade all about me, clicking on insert posts, going to yoga retreats in Bali,

01:57:37.480 --> 01:57:42.520
doing medicine ceremonies, like learning my attachment styles, you know, da da da healing

01:57:42.520 --> 01:57:49.160
my ancestral trauma. And it is fucking exhausting. And I don't feel any better off at all. And all I

01:57:49.160 --> 01:57:55.080
want is somebody to tell me what to think and what to believe. So you have even that from like

01:57:55.080 --> 01:57:59.000
the progressive kind of New Age self help left, you have a return to people are just, you know,

01:57:59.000 --> 01:58:03.560
and Russell Brand converted to Christianity. We have several other mutual friends that have

01:58:03.560 --> 01:58:09.560
just recently come out and sort of stated their claim of returning to Christianity. Jordan Peterson

01:58:09.560 --> 01:58:17.480
has been a voice of right kind of traditionalist classical values and meaning. Here's what's her

01:58:17.480 --> 01:58:23.560
name. I hear some Ali, I think she might have a first name, but it's it's Nile Ferguson's wife

01:58:23.560 --> 01:58:31.240
and partner. She very publicly recently left Islam altogether as her family of origin faith,

01:58:31.880 --> 01:58:38.440
and converted to Christianity. So you're seeing, you know, and then throw in wing nut conspiracy

01:58:38.440 --> 01:58:43.000
theories like QAnon. So those are all expressions of heightened fundamentalism. You're like,

01:58:43.000 --> 01:58:48.600
yep, okay, that was the model seemed like if we don't have solid pillars to hold up our consensus

01:58:48.600 --> 01:58:55.320
reality together, we're all fragmenting and fracturing. And then the nihilism side, you're

01:58:55.320 --> 01:59:05.400
seeing that, you know, I think 50, maybe it was, I think it was 54% of Gen Z surveyed in the United

01:59:05.400 --> 01:59:10.440
States by Pew Research Foundation concluded that they would they would find a military dictatorship

01:59:10.440 --> 01:59:16.920
preferable to representative democracy. And you're like, whoa, okay, that's that's not something

01:59:16.920 --> 01:59:21.560
that's been around for a long time. The recent European parliamentary elections have shown a

01:59:21.560 --> 01:59:29.080
significant rightward shift. And it's getting into the kind of burn it all down territory,

01:59:29.080 --> 01:59:32.600
where people are not, you know, you would used to think that like two parties didn't really matter

01:59:32.600 --> 01:59:36.840
which side you were on, everybody would agree to play by the rules of this great nation we were

01:59:36.840 --> 01:59:42.680
founded on or whatever, you know, or European cultures and governance traditions. And now you're

01:59:42.680 --> 01:59:49.720
having many, many more people in the hashtag burn it all down category. This is marabund. This is

01:59:49.720 --> 01:59:53.800
corrupt. This never should have happened in the first place, or it was a good idea, but it's

01:59:53.800 --> 01:59:57.880
fatally tainted now. And the best thing to do is just bulldoze the whole thing. This is not a fixer

01:59:57.880 --> 02:00:03.560
rapper. Right. This is buy it for the lot and scrape this thing and start again, C steadying

02:00:03.560 --> 02:00:08.360
cryptocurrencies, all those guys have breakaway civilization ideas. And then how's it just

02:00:08.360 --> 02:00:15.240
happening for most people, for most people that are pulled into the nihilism. It's just personally

02:00:15.240 --> 02:00:19.800
and psychologically and emotionally overwhelming. So those folks aren't on Twitter, and they're

02:00:19.800 --> 02:00:23.080
not hatching, you know, they're not hatching plans for breakaway societies or, you know,

02:00:23.080 --> 02:00:27.880
or following Steve Bannon to some fascist retreat in the Italian Alps, right, those people are just

02:00:27.880 --> 02:00:35.960
succumbing to diseases of despair, addiction, depression, anxiety, suicide. And so that is

02:00:35.960 --> 02:00:41.480
what we're seeing at this point. And so the question is, is into that vacuum, we would expect

02:00:41.480 --> 02:00:51.000
to see all sorts of cultic communities arise. Right. Give me a charismatic, demagogic leader,

02:00:51.000 --> 02:00:57.800
give me someone who's pulling the juice, right, who has a certainty that is persuasive or compelling.

02:00:58.440 --> 02:01:02.920
And that can promise me that all that I'm seeing and experiencing right now isn't,

02:01:03.480 --> 02:01:08.600
isn't wrong or bad or my fault. There's someone or something to blame. There's always something

02:01:08.600 --> 02:01:16.120
or someone to blame because that's the tribalism DNA. Right. And we can get to a happily ever after

02:01:16.120 --> 02:01:24.280
if you only follow me, join us, do the thing, which is a rapturous ideology. Like the world,

02:01:24.280 --> 02:01:29.720
you're right, the world is screwed up, it's fucked up, it's irredeemable. And we're coming

02:01:29.720 --> 02:01:34.280
to an inflection point really soon where everything changes. Right. That could be the

02:01:34.280 --> 02:01:38.200
revolution, that could be the rapture, it could be whatever it is. It could be artificial general

02:01:38.200 --> 02:01:43.640
intelligence at some point soon, we can see it from here if we squint. It's coming. So get ready

02:01:43.640 --> 02:01:49.800
and follow me because here's the deal on the other side of that inflection point. Us, our tribe,

02:01:49.800 --> 02:01:55.960
we come up roses. We're actually better off on the other side. So let's get there as fast as possible.

02:01:57.320 --> 02:02:03.880
Right. And hop on board. And those rapture ideologies, they show up in fundamentalist

02:02:03.880 --> 02:02:07.800
religion, but they also show up in techno utopianism. They show up in Silicon Valley with Ray Cozwell

02:02:07.800 --> 02:02:15.080
and Peter Diamandis and Mark Andreessen. Right. They show up in, the storm is coming and QAnon

02:02:15.080 --> 02:02:20.680
stuff. Right. You see them everywhere. They show up in crypto, hodl, you know, like, and then there's

02:02:20.680 --> 02:02:26.040
going to be some collapse in fiat currency and then everybody holding fat Bitcoin and ETH wallets

02:02:26.040 --> 02:02:31.880
will come up roses and we'll have a debt jubilee and we'll reboot the entire global financial

02:02:31.880 --> 02:02:39.640
systems. Right. Everybody's peddling some version of that. And they sell hope because they all

02:02:39.640 --> 02:02:45.880
promise to leapfrog the train wreck that's in front of us. And the train wreck is much harder to sort

02:02:45.880 --> 02:02:51.560
out. So it's like, well, we're not even going to sort it out. And in fact, our buddy Doug Rushkoff,

02:02:51.560 --> 02:02:57.960
who wrote team human and doomsday prep for the super rich, even called it the mindset in Silicon

02:02:57.960 --> 02:03:03.000
Valley in particular, because he was he was brought by like five hedge fund guys flown out to some

02:03:03.000 --> 02:03:07.320
super secret desert compound and given tens of thousands of dollars to give a talk. And he thought

02:03:07.320 --> 02:03:11.480
he was giving a real talk. And then he realized, oh, these guys, there's no one to talk to you. It's

02:03:11.480 --> 02:03:14.840
not like they're whole stable of traders that he was here to talk to. It was just them. And they

02:03:14.840 --> 02:03:20.680
wanted to grill him on the apocalypse. And he identified, which I thought was a brilliant move,

02:03:20.680 --> 02:03:25.160
the mindset. And he called it with a capital M, the mindset. And the mindset is fundamentally,

02:03:25.240 --> 02:03:31.800
you know, not unique to Silicon Valley, but ubiquitous in Silicon Valley of, hey,

02:03:32.600 --> 02:03:37.240
never mind all these messy human problems, never mind our cultural history, never mind

02:03:37.240 --> 02:03:42.840
our government, never mind rules and regulations, never mind any of that. We'll we'll we just want

02:03:42.840 --> 02:03:49.960
a blank piece of paper to rebuild our utopian vision on. So we're not going to engage in humanity.

02:03:49.960 --> 02:03:54.120
This is a bunch of sort of Asperger guys, you know, fundamentally, like,

02:03:54.120 --> 02:03:59.800
under socialized, not especially well-mammaled, rarely in the company or the accountability

02:03:59.800 --> 02:04:05.720
of a good strong woman, imagining these fictive scenarios where it's up and out.

02:04:06.920 --> 02:04:10.760
And whether that's Mars or whether that's some, you know, real estate we bought in, you know,

02:04:10.760 --> 02:04:15.160
inland, inland from the Bay Area and we're rebooting there or, you know, or it's, you know,

02:04:15.160 --> 02:04:23.960
offshore or or it's wherever. And and that tends to be a situation that almost always

02:04:25.080 --> 02:04:29.080
is a one percenter solution. However you slice the one percent, it could be

02:04:29.080 --> 02:04:33.080
that worth, but it could be the morally elect or saved, it could be the intelligent and the

02:04:33.080 --> 02:04:36.920
brilliant, it could be the holders of my certain crypto coin, it could be whomever,

02:04:36.920 --> 02:04:43.320
but it's a one percenter play that leaves 99 percent of humanity and all the four-leggeds,

02:04:43.320 --> 02:04:46.840
you know, and the winged and the finned and everybody, you know, all the other creatures on

02:04:46.840 --> 02:04:53.960
this earth with the short end of that straw. So that's what brings us back to what are solutions,

02:04:53.960 --> 02:04:59.960
what's a civilizational calculus that works for everyone, everywhere, everyone. All of us are

02:04:59.960 --> 02:05:07.080
none of us, just as an ethical pledge. And this planet, you know, no fucking off to space if we

02:05:08.040 --> 02:05:15.160
trashed Eden and we're trying to reconstruct habitable environments out of completely contrived

02:05:15.160 --> 02:05:21.400
situations like not going to happen. These bodies, right, the idea of not becoming cyborgs,

02:05:21.400 --> 02:05:27.800
actually honoring these beautiful organisms that we've been gifted with being self-aware within

02:05:28.680 --> 02:05:35.080
and this lifetime, you know, not punting to life, indefinite life extension

02:05:35.720 --> 02:05:44.680
for a fortunate few, but to say we fully embrace this human lifespan, we fully embrace this earth,

02:05:44.680 --> 02:05:53.000
we fully embrace our bodies to take a stand for all of us, right? On behalf of the good,

02:05:53.000 --> 02:05:58.040
the true and the beautiful, I mean, none of this is new, right? This is, if you think about

02:05:59.000 --> 02:06:05.720
what we see on Instagram and TikTok these days, where we are constantly shouted at and whispered

02:06:05.720 --> 02:06:15.160
at and promised and seduced to believe that you can have it all now in just three easy steps,

02:06:16.360 --> 02:06:23.240
right? Like scan the world's wisdom traditions, scan every saint, sage, and philosopher that has

02:06:23.240 --> 02:06:29.320
ever lived and left a mark in our collective consciousness and not a single one of them

02:06:29.320 --> 02:06:38.840
has said anything remotely that juvenile, self-obsessed or perverse. You know, what have they said?

02:06:38.840 --> 02:06:45.640
They've said, hey, life's a mixed bag, right? I mean, I defer to, there's that old, old Yeller,

02:06:45.640 --> 02:06:50.520
was a famous Disney movie about a kid who adopts a dog. We actually listened to it as we were

02:06:50.520 --> 02:06:54.200
moving our family to Austin. I'm like, oh, great. I remember old Yeller. We'll do a book on tape.

02:06:54.200 --> 02:06:57.800
That'll be the road trip. As it turns out, of course, with all dog movies and all horse movies,

02:06:57.800 --> 02:07:01.640
the dog doesn't make it. He gets, he defends them and he gets bitten by a wolf or a coyote.

02:07:01.640 --> 02:07:05.640
He gets rabies. They have to put him down, right? So the sun is broken up, as were our kids in the

02:07:05.640 --> 02:07:10.360
backseat. They're like, dad, we are never, ever listening to another book on tape about a dog

02:07:10.360 --> 02:07:15.560
again. And the dad's sitting on the rocking chair on their, on their ranch house. And he's like, son,

02:07:16.440 --> 02:07:21.720
the way I, the best, the way I figure it, you know, about half a life is good parts

02:07:21.720 --> 02:07:28.440
and half a life is bad parts. But if you spend all the good parts worrying about all the bad parts,

02:07:28.440 --> 02:07:38.040
why, then it's all bad. You know, and that's, that's St. Francis, Augustine, Buddha, Lao Tzu,

02:07:38.680 --> 02:07:43.960
right? You know, like, they, they all acknowledge life's a bitch and then we die.

02:07:45.320 --> 02:07:50.920
And then there's inevitably the, so what do we do about that in the in-between?

02:07:51.880 --> 02:07:58.040
And my sense right now, and maybe we can, maybe we can even wrap with this, right,

02:07:58.040 --> 02:08:01.960
is how to find hope. What, what is the antidote to cynicism, right? The antidote to cynicism is

02:08:01.960 --> 02:08:10.520
a point on a purpose. And Joanna Macy, who's a Zen grandmother and, you know, one of the most

02:08:11.640 --> 02:08:19.560
profound ecologists and activists of her generation, she's described our time in history,

02:08:20.280 --> 02:08:25.560
right, as being the people of the passage. Like it is on us to get from here to there.

02:08:26.040 --> 02:08:31.000
And if you think about the, you know, the settlement of the Western Hemisphere, like arguably through

02:08:31.000 --> 02:08:38.360
the land bridge, right, between Asia and Alaska, Beringia, right? We are all Beringians now,

02:08:39.640 --> 02:08:47.800
but in time, not space, right? So where like 15,000 Asian nomads shimmied across that in little boats

02:08:47.800 --> 02:08:52.520
and, you know, on foot and in the ice ages and various bits and pieces to make it and populate

02:08:52.520 --> 02:08:58.360
this entire half the world. We're doing that in time. Like there's a constraint coming. There's a

02:08:58.360 --> 02:09:04.680
constraint coming, which is how do we transition off this hyper-consumptive, right, techno-industrial

02:09:04.680 --> 02:09:09.880
cub and indulgent civilization, this complex dissipative structure, right, that's creating

02:09:09.880 --> 02:09:15.960
entropy like nobody's business. How do we, how do we navigate that with a bloated population of

02:09:15.960 --> 02:09:21.720
eight billion people, half of which would not exist? I mean, A, half of which happened in my lifetime,

02:09:21.720 --> 02:09:27.800
right? We went from four billion to eight billion since the 70s. And at the same time,

02:09:27.800 --> 02:09:32.600
half of the people alive, every single one of those new extra people only is here because we're

02:09:32.600 --> 02:09:39.400
using fossil fuels as fertilizers and pesticides. So how do we do this? This is a complex dissipated

02:09:39.400 --> 02:09:44.120
structure, this energy-hungry civilization that if we stop the energy inputs collapses. If it

02:09:44.120 --> 02:09:51.080
collapses, that's curtains for so many of us and so much tragedy and suffering. So how do we leapfrog

02:09:52.520 --> 02:10:01.000
from this situation to a lower carbon, higher energy, higher efficiency civilization that

02:10:01.000 --> 02:10:06.760
protects and preserves us? So that's Jim and Macy's question. We're the people of the passage,

02:10:07.560 --> 02:10:13.720
right? What is ours to do? How do we maintain hope, right? How do we die before we die,

02:10:14.760 --> 02:10:20.120
right? So that we know our lives are forfeit. I'm no longer just a self-interested little monkey

02:10:20.120 --> 02:10:25.320
seeking pleasure and avoiding pain. I realize my life is my offering. My life is my gift.

02:10:25.320 --> 02:10:32.040
So that's step one. Step two, go from living as a fragmented, isolated little potted plant

02:10:32.760 --> 02:10:38.840
of a deconditioned zoo animal, hyper neurotic consumer individual to taking my stand in a

02:10:38.840 --> 02:10:44.360
stand of community and relations. How do I live seven generationally? How do I live on behalf of

02:10:44.360 --> 02:10:49.720
my great-great grandparents who clearly busted us to get me this little ember that I've now fanned

02:10:49.720 --> 02:10:54.440
into a flame? Do I get to say I'm sad or mad or disappointed? They didn't give me more. No,

02:10:54.440 --> 02:11:00.680
they fucking gave me the emper and I'm now basking in a bonfire like amen. And my three generations

02:11:00.680 --> 02:11:05.960
ahead of me, my children, my children's children, my children's children's children, how do I live

02:11:05.960 --> 02:11:11.000
as part of that seven generations? And then to your point about what does life have a purpose,

02:11:11.000 --> 02:11:17.160
does it have a point? It's both, right? Life is both cyclical and endlessly creating and destroying

02:11:17.160 --> 02:11:22.840
and that is senseless and amoral and horrifying to contemplate from our point of view, where we

02:11:22.840 --> 02:11:29.160
care deeply about our little part of things. And it's also a creative. Every single time that

02:11:29.160 --> 02:11:34.840
cycle of creation and destruction happens, it spits out complexity. It spits out these novel,

02:11:34.840 --> 02:11:41.960
rare, precious moments and we can anchor to them by ritual, seeking refuge and ritual,

02:11:42.680 --> 02:11:48.200
mocking the seasons, mocking our lives, mocking our rites of passage, right? Noticing one of the

02:11:48.200 --> 02:11:53.400
most profound ones I've seen was just a black and white photo of a Jewish family in Amsterdam

02:11:53.400 --> 02:11:59.960
in 1941 celebrating Hanukkah. And you're like, oh man, like that was darkness. That was peak,

02:11:59.960 --> 02:12:05.560
peak darkness of World War II. And there they were oppressed and hunted. And they were still

02:12:05.560 --> 02:12:11.160
bearing witness to their lineage's rituals. Think of the Tibetan diaspora. Think of any

02:12:11.160 --> 02:12:17.320
First Nation peoples that have been relocated. Think of the Rohingya, the Uighurs, right? The Kurds,

02:12:17.880 --> 02:12:22.520
you know, the Roma, like there are fourth world peoples, peoples without a homeland,

02:12:23.240 --> 02:12:27.400
right? That have been able to persist by carrying their rituals. So this is what it means to be

02:12:27.400 --> 02:12:32.200
the people of the passage. And if we can do those three things, right? If we can die before we die,

02:12:32.200 --> 02:12:36.920
so we know what's ours to give, we can live seven generationally. So that stretches out our sense

02:12:37.240 --> 02:12:43.480
of what if I don't get mine? No. Oh, it's okay. Because I'm doing something on behalf of those

02:12:43.480 --> 02:12:49.720
yet to be. And we seek refuge and ritual. We anchor the insanity and the constant slipstream

02:12:50.280 --> 02:12:57.400
towards entropy with observing the passages. And then finally, what does that allow us to do?

02:12:57.400 --> 02:13:02.920
It allows us to leave space for grace. Because none of us know how this is going to turn out.

02:13:02.920 --> 02:13:10.280
And that's Thanos's pathology, right? Thanos is right up to the point where he is 100% certain

02:13:11.240 --> 02:13:16.760
of how it's all going to turn out. And therefore that justifies his murderous behavior. We can never

02:13:16.760 --> 02:13:27.480
be sure. There's a great quote I heard recently, which is we control nothing. We influence everything.

02:13:28.440 --> 02:13:37.160
And we have no idea, right, where those ripples will go. So by leaving space for grace, like,

02:13:37.160 --> 02:13:41.640
do we know how this all turns out? No, none of us could possibly know how it all turns out. But one

02:13:41.640 --> 02:13:50.200
thing is certain. If we give up hope now, then hope has no chance. If we hold on to radical hope,

02:13:50.200 --> 02:13:55.160
which is a very, it's actually, it's not just an adjective or a superlative, it's an academic term

02:13:55.880 --> 02:13:59.000
from Jonathan Laird at the University of Chicago, who studied 19th century Indian

02:13:59.000 --> 02:14:03.400
reservations. And radical hope is a specific definition. It's having hope for a future you

02:14:03.400 --> 02:14:11.240
cannot see from here, but commit to nonetheless. So leaving space for grace, right, is the

02:14:11.240 --> 02:14:17.640
butterfly effect. Time soul force at the end of time for all the models.

02:14:18.040 --> 02:14:26.840
That's brilliant. And I'd like to read a quote to you from my favorite movie, Lord of the Rings,

02:14:26.840 --> 02:14:32.040
that I think it just kept coming up in this conversation. And especially now,

02:14:32.680 --> 02:14:35.640
we're at the end of two towers. You've seen Lord of the Rings, right?

02:14:36.600 --> 02:14:41.800
Oh, dude, I did my senior thesis in high school on Lord of the Rings. I've been way in the pudding.

02:14:41.800 --> 02:14:46.600
We ran a camp called Rivendell long before the movies came out. Oh, my God, that sounds amazing.

02:14:46.600 --> 02:14:53.560
So at the end of two towers, when all hope seemed to be lost, Sam says to Frodo, it's all wrong

02:14:53.560 --> 02:14:58.760
by rights. We shouldn't even be here. But we are. It's like in the great stories, Mr. Frodo,

02:14:58.760 --> 02:15:03.720
the ones that really mattered, full of darkness and danger they were. And sometimes you didn't

02:15:03.720 --> 02:15:08.440
even want to know the end, because how could the end be happy? How could the world go back to

02:15:08.440 --> 02:15:13.800
the way it was before so much bad happened? But in the end, it is only a passing thing,

02:15:13.800 --> 02:15:19.960
this shadow. Even darkness must pass. A new day will come. And when the sun shines, it will

02:15:19.960 --> 02:15:24.760
shine out the clearer. Those were the stories that stayed with you, that meant something.

02:15:25.480 --> 02:15:32.040
Even if you were too small to understand why. But I think, Mr. Frodo, I do understand. I know now.

02:15:32.920 --> 02:15:36.680
Folk in those stories had lots of chances of turning back, only they didn't,

02:15:36.680 --> 02:15:39.560
because they were holding on to something. And then Frodo says,

02:15:40.360 --> 02:15:45.160
what were they holding on to, Sam? And he says that there's something good in this world,

02:15:45.160 --> 02:15:51.800
Mr. Frodo, and it's worth fighting for. And so like, when you told me about the family

02:15:51.800 --> 02:15:56.920
celebrating Hanukkah in 1941, in the midst of World War II, they're being hunted.

02:15:57.960 --> 02:16:04.440
You know, it's like in the darkest night, they held on to that little flame, and that got them

02:16:04.440 --> 02:16:10.120
through the deep dark. You know, you got to hold on to something. You got to find some

02:16:10.120 --> 02:16:16.360
little shred of good in this world, and hold on to it, and that'll get you through anything. And

02:16:18.440 --> 02:16:21.720
you know, it's like the night is the coldest just before dawn.

02:16:23.080 --> 02:16:26.680
Which if you spend any time in the mountains, is you know, like you're literally waiting for

02:16:26.680 --> 02:16:33.160
the sun to come up to get some sleep. Yeah, yeah, so no matter how bad things seem,

02:16:34.040 --> 02:16:37.240
it'll pass. And you just got to hold on to what is good.

02:16:38.920 --> 02:16:45.160
Well, you know, to riff on the Tolkien stuff, that notion of leaving space for grace, because

02:16:45.160 --> 02:16:51.320
like we don't know how it's going to turn out, isn't simply the kind of Hollywood version of a

02:16:51.320 --> 02:16:55.400
story of like, oh, it's climactic, and we don't know. And then finally Rocky comes back with the

02:16:55.400 --> 02:17:00.760
final punch and wins the belt, you know, like that kind of a thing. Because if you think about,

02:17:00.760 --> 02:17:07.000
I mean, I think it's so brilliant how Tolkien did this, right? Because how does, against all

02:17:07.000 --> 02:17:15.080
overwhelming odds of Mordor and darkness, how does light prevail? Right? Light prevails in Lord

02:17:15.080 --> 02:17:24.280
of the Rings through the perverse actions of Golan. And, and somewhere earlier, I think Sam,

02:17:24.280 --> 02:17:28.760
you know, Sam hates Golan, right? And he's in that constant back and forth with Frodo.

02:17:29.480 --> 02:17:35.800
And Sam wants to kill him. And Gandalf intervenes. And he says he may yet have a part to play.

02:17:35.800 --> 02:17:39.160
Oh, Frodo wants to kill him. Oh, does he? Okay.

02:17:39.160 --> 02:17:42.680
In the beginning. Yeah. In the first one, Frodo wants to kill him. And Gandalf says that.

02:17:42.680 --> 02:17:48.360
Yes. Okay. Thank you. So first, so yes, the Hobbits want to kill Golan, who's Smeagol,

02:17:48.360 --> 02:17:52.280
who is arguably, I mean, you know, I think there's a new film now coming out is going to pack a

02:17:52.280 --> 02:17:56.120
bunch of this, but like, right. I mean, he was a Hobbit like device before he gets completely

02:17:56.120 --> 02:18:00.360
warped by the ring. So it's in some respect, it's the Hobbit's shadow self, right? And they want to

02:18:00.360 --> 02:18:08.760
kill him. Gandalf says, hey, wait, he may still. So the, the, the simplistic version of that would

02:18:08.760 --> 02:18:15.480
be, oh, we show him love and compassion. And then Smeagol triumphs over Golan, right? And we now

02:18:15.480 --> 02:18:19.720
integrate him into the light and he's on team good guy and he does something good for us. No,

02:18:19.800 --> 02:18:26.360
that's not what happens, right? In the crux, not even Frodo stays true to his higher nature. The

02:18:26.360 --> 02:18:36.360
ring bends everyone. Smeagol collapses entirely into his Golan self. And they are struggling

02:18:36.360 --> 02:18:44.360
shadow to shadow and that somehow with the biting off of Frodo's finger, right? And Golan falling

02:18:44.360 --> 02:18:53.320
into Mount Doom, that's what saves it. And that kind of impossible ambiguity, right, still delivering

02:18:53.880 --> 02:19:00.360
redemption to me is one of the best lessons for us because it's not a happily ever after

02:19:00.360 --> 02:19:07.080
simplistic heroic arc. It's not where good is rewarded with good and bad and evil is punished.

02:19:07.080 --> 02:19:14.200
It's a wildly ironic ending, right? But the leaving space for grace, which is what Gandalf

02:19:14.200 --> 02:19:20.600
was taking a stand for back before he possibly had any idea what that might mean, right? It's

02:19:20.600 --> 02:19:28.200
the commitment to that that then saves Middle Earth. And that I think is one of the most

02:19:29.320 --> 02:19:33.960
powerful lessons for all of us because again, from time to time, we're going to be facing or

02:19:33.960 --> 02:19:39.560
not even from time to time, probably increasingly, we will be facing a litany of news that simply

02:19:39.560 --> 02:19:46.600
doesn't pencil out. And the kind of whistling past the graveyard hope, you know, is simply going to

02:19:46.600 --> 02:19:56.280
be inadequate. So we have to be able to anchor to something deeper and more enduring. And I think

02:19:56.280 --> 02:20:03.400
Gandalf's lesson is a beautiful one for all of us. Absolutely. Well, on that note, I think this

02:20:03.400 --> 02:20:08.920
podcast has gone amazing right from the beginning. You were just on fire. I like the podcast where

02:20:09.000 --> 02:20:17.880
I don't have to talk much. For me, if I talk like less than 1%, that's great. But this was amazing.

02:20:17.880 --> 02:20:24.120
And I'm sure there's going to be lots of great clips to extract from this. And thanks for taking

02:20:24.120 --> 02:20:30.040
the time. Dude, I mean, I'm happy to, you know, just continue this conversation, you know,

02:20:30.040 --> 02:20:36.280
on and off screen, however it makes sense. But I think there's tons of overlap in the things you're

02:20:36.280 --> 02:20:41.160
curious about and care about and the stuff that, you know, the trees we're barking at as well. So

02:20:42.200 --> 02:20:48.600
so much overlap. It's kind of shocking, like all the names you were saying are people that I've been

02:20:48.600 --> 02:20:52.920
curious about. And the books you were mentioning were ones that I like, I feel like if we were two

02:20:52.920 --> 02:20:57.400
planets, we're like, our orbits are kind of like getting pretty close to each other.

02:20:58.920 --> 02:21:03.000
Totally. Yeah. Totally totally. All right, Mike. Awesome. Thanks for the time.
