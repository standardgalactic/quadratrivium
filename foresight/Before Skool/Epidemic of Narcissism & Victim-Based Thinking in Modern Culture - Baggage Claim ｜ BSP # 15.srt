00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Today, we have an awesome guest, the creator of Baggage Claim.

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Welcome.

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Hi.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Hi, Mark.

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,000
How are you?

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Good.

7
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,000
How are you?

8
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Good.

9
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Thanks for having me.

10
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Of course.

11
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,000
I love your channel.

12
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,000
And I find it so refreshing.

13
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,640
And on Baggage Claim, you talk about cultural issues, but you take a really nice philosophical

14
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:29,240
approach to them and, you know, it's so confusing.

15
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:31,520
We live in such a time of chaos.

16
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:36,400
And to hear your take has been just refreshing as the word that comes to mind.

17
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:37,400
Thank you so much.

18
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:39,000
And I feel the same way about after school.

19
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,080
I absolutely love your channel, consume everything.

20
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:49,440
And I've been very inspired by how you, you have these takes where you'll draw really

21
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:54,040
good parallels without actually mentioning the particular issues that you're talking

22
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:55,040
about.

23
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:58,240
And I think in that way, you make your videos so timeless and universal.

24
00:00:58,240 --> 00:01:02,800
So that's actually really been inspiring me to, to be better at doing that.

25
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:04,360
Oh, well, thank you.

26
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:08,600
That means a lot, especially coming from you, great creator.

27
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:14,500
So yeah, before we, this video will come out right after our collaboration comes out.

28
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:16,160
So we can talk about that.

29
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:21,320
But first I'd love to hear about just what were you doing before you started your channel?

30
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:22,320
Sure.

31
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:29,120
I, for a better part of a decade, I've been working in the startup space.

32
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:31,960
And so doing something completely else, that's not really where I started.

33
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:36,480
I started off as an accountant and then slowly got entered into startups.

34
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:39,080
I was inspired by my brother to move up to the Bay Area.

35
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:44,120
I used to live in Los Angeles before that and then moved to the Bay Area and really

36
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:49,980
enjoyed that aspect of sort of learning on the job, you know, at a startup, you kind

37
00:01:49,980 --> 00:01:53,060
of wear multiple hats, you have to do whatever it takes.

38
00:01:53,060 --> 00:01:56,500
So I learned a lot, but I kept kind of missing something.

39
00:01:56,500 --> 00:02:01,220
I kept feeling like there was a part of me that just kind of realized that I was not

40
00:02:01,220 --> 00:02:03,260
really meant for the job.

41
00:02:03,260 --> 00:02:07,340
In a lot of ways, I'm, I wasn't really enjoying it.

42
00:02:07,340 --> 00:02:08,620
It felt very forced.

43
00:02:08,620 --> 00:02:13,620
I was kind of forcing myself into this particular mold of being this big exec.

44
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:18,940
I had this, you know, big dreams of, of that I was going to be this big executive.

45
00:02:18,940 --> 00:02:23,740
And the more I got into it, the more unhappy I became.

46
00:02:23,740 --> 00:02:29,260
And so I finally sort of got to that point, I think around the 30 mark, I've heard a lot

47
00:02:29,260 --> 00:02:33,340
of people share similar stories where you stop trying to force yourself into being something.

48
00:02:33,340 --> 00:02:37,300
You finally just acknowledge what you are and what you could be if you stopped trying

49
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:39,020
to force things.

50
00:02:39,020 --> 00:02:43,020
And I just reached that point and I said, you know, I don't want to do this anymore.

51
00:02:43,020 --> 00:02:45,540
I was fantasizing about YouTube videos.

52
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:52,700
I was thinking a lot about, uh, about, uh, you know, I was thinking in video essay form.

53
00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:54,340
And I said, okay, I think it's time.

54
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:56,180
I think it's time to, to leave all that.

55
00:02:56,180 --> 00:03:01,020
And it was a good time because 2020 happened, you know, all the madness that happened with

56
00:03:01,020 --> 00:03:02,020
2020.

57
00:03:02,020 --> 00:03:05,340
And it was a good time to take a pause and step back because everybody was kind of separated

58
00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:06,340
out anyway.

59
00:03:06,340 --> 00:03:09,660
So there wasn't enough distraction of the world.

60
00:03:09,660 --> 00:03:13,620
And that's when I came up with the concept of baggage claim.

61
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:21,820
And it, I was motivated by wanting to talk about, uh, issues, personal issues, professional

62
00:03:21,820 --> 00:03:27,700
issues, psychological issues that people might have on an individual level, but also culturally,

63
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:30,340
what are things that we can't sort of see eye to eye on?

64
00:03:30,340 --> 00:03:32,140
And where can we meet in the middle?

65
00:03:32,140 --> 00:03:35,140
Because things were becoming more and more polarized, more and people were getting angrier

66
00:03:35,140 --> 00:03:36,980
and angrier and angrier.

67
00:03:36,980 --> 00:03:40,140
And, um, being in, you know, I'm, I'm based in San Francisco.

68
00:03:40,140 --> 00:03:46,220
So being in San Francisco, things just over the last 10 years just became so polarized.

69
00:03:46,220 --> 00:03:53,540
And my opinions that I thought were perfectly acceptable before were suddenly completely

70
00:03:53,540 --> 00:03:58,300
being ostracized, especially I had to be really, really quiet in professional settings or

71
00:03:58,300 --> 00:04:02,740
people were making assumptions about how I think politically, just based on the color

72
00:04:02,740 --> 00:04:05,260
of my skin or my gender.

73
00:04:05,260 --> 00:04:10,340
And so I found those instances very strange and I said, this is, this, this can't be the

74
00:04:10,340 --> 00:04:11,620
future of our society.

75
00:04:11,620 --> 00:04:14,660
We have to be headed in a better place.

76
00:04:14,660 --> 00:04:21,100
And so, and that's what really inspired me to, to start thinking about, about what I

77
00:04:21,100 --> 00:04:24,820
could be contributing to that conversation.

78
00:04:24,820 --> 00:04:26,060
Hmm.

79
00:04:26,060 --> 00:04:33,460
So you basically got so uncomfortable in that startup environment that it pushed you to

80
00:04:33,780 --> 00:04:35,660
express your creativity.

81
00:04:35,660 --> 00:04:40,060
That story really resonates with me because I have, I had a similar thing where you feel

82
00:04:40,060 --> 00:04:45,460
like you're just a cognitive machine and you feel like you're not being able to be creative.

83
00:04:45,460 --> 00:04:49,180
And that's kind of what people are put on earth to do is be creative.

84
00:04:49,180 --> 00:04:53,940
And if you're not doing that, you, you just, you feel completely inauthentic and it's almost

85
00:04:53,940 --> 00:04:56,900
like you have a psychological death.

86
00:04:56,900 --> 00:05:01,100
And so now are you doing a baggage claim full time?

87
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:02,100
Yes.

88
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:03,100
Full time.

89
00:05:03,100 --> 00:05:07,060
And so just, you know, what you said, I also found that so much of my work, because I never

90
00:05:07,060 --> 00:05:09,660
really thought of myself as a very creative person.

91
00:05:09,660 --> 00:05:12,860
Even though I used to write a lot of stories when I was a kid, I just didn't think of myself

92
00:05:12,860 --> 00:05:13,860
like that.

93
00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:19,020
And my role just became sort of babysitting a lot of people, making sure that they did

94
00:05:19,020 --> 00:05:20,020
their job.

95
00:05:20,020 --> 00:05:25,300
That kind of became my everyday job was, Hey, can you make sure that people meet their deadlines?

96
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:29,940
And I found that to be such a strange idea that there was no self governance for a lot

97
00:05:29,940 --> 00:05:33,900
of people and they would find reasons to justify not getting their work done.

98
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:39,940
And, and I was just going around chasing things down and, and people, people were very kind

99
00:05:39,940 --> 00:05:45,020
about, you know, pushing this narrative that I'm, oh, I'm the woman who gets shit done.

100
00:05:45,020 --> 00:05:50,180
You know, that was kind of the tagline under my slack was, you know, she gets shit done.

101
00:05:50,180 --> 00:05:54,620
And, and yet I found, well, why, why am I doing that?

102
00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:57,140
Is that really helping people at the end of the day?

103
00:05:57,140 --> 00:05:59,140
Is that actually contributing anything positive?

104
00:05:59,180 --> 00:06:02,740
I just felt like a, I just felt kind of like a fetcher of sorts.

105
00:06:02,740 --> 00:06:04,900
So, you know, it's, it's what you're saying.

106
00:06:04,900 --> 00:06:08,940
It's that psychological death because you're actually not being as productive as you could

107
00:06:08,940 --> 00:06:09,940
be.

108
00:06:10,940 --> 00:06:13,060
Well, you are definitely getting shit done on your channel.

109
00:06:14,140 --> 00:06:15,140
Yeah.

110
00:06:16,940 --> 00:06:23,660
So I've been really hyper focused on the issues that you talk about on your channel, because

111
00:06:24,660 --> 00:06:28,860
movies in particular seem to be at the center of the culture war now.

112
00:06:28,860 --> 00:06:29,860
Yes.

113
00:06:29,860 --> 00:06:35,460
And it seems like our modern movies have been overtaken by some sort of rot within.

114
00:06:36,460 --> 00:06:43,660
And I've been really into channels like critical drinker and nerd Roddick and your channel.

115
00:06:45,540 --> 00:06:50,860
And I'm curious to know like your answer is just why are modern movies failing to connect

116
00:06:50,860 --> 00:06:51,860
with audiences?

117
00:06:52,860 --> 00:06:59,620
I think, honestly, analyzing that question ends up answering a bigger question around

118
00:06:59,620 --> 00:07:02,780
what's wrong with society in general.

119
00:07:02,780 --> 00:07:07,820
And it could be perfectly summed up with we are caught up in this pursuit of the overly

120
00:07:07,820 --> 00:07:10,100
simplistic approach.

121
00:07:10,100 --> 00:07:17,660
I think if you think about the appeal of going the simple route is because it's possible

122
00:07:17,660 --> 00:07:20,100
today because of the advent of social media.

123
00:07:20,140 --> 00:07:26,900
So if I have a particular opinion, if I take it online, I could put that out there and

124
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:30,020
immediately get likes, whatever that opinion might be.

125
00:07:30,020 --> 00:07:37,100
So I can build up a reputation pretty easily by minimal effort and just say things that

126
00:07:37,100 --> 00:07:42,740
are particularly popular or, you know, rile people up, whatever, whatever my base level

127
00:07:42,740 --> 00:07:44,660
goal might be.

128
00:07:44,700 --> 00:07:53,860
And that sort of thinking has really translated into movie making because to make a good movie,

129
00:07:53,860 --> 00:07:55,260
it takes a lot of work.

130
00:07:55,260 --> 00:07:56,980
It takes so much effort.

131
00:07:56,980 --> 00:07:59,220
And this is something Chris Gore talked about.

132
00:07:59,220 --> 00:08:03,740
He and I were messaging back and forth about this a couple of weeks ago.

133
00:08:03,740 --> 00:08:09,700
And someone who wrote for his website Film Threat talked about that there's this perception

134
00:08:09,700 --> 00:08:12,980
that movie making is actually really simple and anyone can do it.

135
00:08:12,980 --> 00:08:20,460
And there's like a form of jealousy, but also this marginalization of the effort.

136
00:08:20,460 --> 00:08:25,580
And there's not that realization that to put something together, that's a good narrative,

137
00:08:25,580 --> 00:08:32,420
you know, good structure, good, a good heart to it, good dialogue even takes a lot of thought,

138
00:08:32,420 --> 00:08:38,900
takes a lot of experience, a lot of consternation, a lot of collaboration to come up with something

139
00:08:38,900 --> 00:08:40,700
like that.

140
00:08:40,700 --> 00:08:48,420
And that's not really the approach that modern writers that have gotten into these writer

141
00:08:48,420 --> 00:08:53,060
rooms because they meet certain diversity criteria.

142
00:08:53,060 --> 00:08:55,300
They don't think like that.

143
00:08:55,300 --> 00:09:07,340
And a lot of the identity politics is rooted around that belief that ability is not really

144
00:09:07,940 --> 00:09:12,140
something that can be achieved through effort.

145
00:09:12,140 --> 00:09:17,740
Ability is inherent to your experience or, you know, you're the color of your skin.

146
00:09:17,740 --> 00:09:23,340
So for example, and I was talking about this on NerdRotix channel last week that there's

147
00:09:23,340 --> 00:09:30,940
that belief that a woman who checks certain boxes has something really unique to say.

148
00:09:30,940 --> 00:09:36,740
Because if you I don't know if you know, but Disney released a new TV show called Echo,

149
00:09:36,740 --> 00:09:42,740
and it's it hits it's like the intersectional gold mine, so to speak, because the main character

150
00:09:42,740 --> 00:09:50,700
Maya is a woman, she's indigenous, she's deaf, and she is an amputee.

151
00:09:50,700 --> 00:09:57,780
So she just hits so many, you know, checked boxes that all the people have to sort of

152
00:09:57,780 --> 00:10:03,740
step back and bow down and say, you know, this woman's going to offer us an understanding

153
00:10:03,740 --> 00:10:08,640
that's going to be so unique that nobody's ever, you know, could could even perceive what

154
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:13,580
she might have to say or if she, you know, if she can't speak but represent.

155
00:10:13,580 --> 00:10:19,980
And that is just such a falsehood of belief that we are all so individually unique.

156
00:10:19,980 --> 00:10:23,540
It's that idea of saying like everybody's special and such a and everybody has such

157
00:10:23,540 --> 00:10:25,300
a unique thing to do.

158
00:10:25,300 --> 00:10:33,580
The thing is everybody has value to add, but we are a lot more similar than we are different.

159
00:10:33,860 --> 00:10:40,140
What makes a story good is when it speaks to universal truths that hit close to home

160
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:46,660
that can actually, you know, they actually get to your heart, not because you look a

161
00:10:46,660 --> 00:10:52,020
certain way or you you you have a certain background, but it's because of the universal

162
00:10:52,020 --> 00:10:54,100
human experience.

163
00:10:54,100 --> 00:11:00,180
And this past weekend when I was watching I was watching the behind the scenes for Lord

164
00:11:00,220 --> 00:11:05,540
of the Rings, which is the greatest trilogy of all time created of all time.

165
00:11:05,540 --> 00:11:09,220
And I love watching the behind the scenes more than even sometimes watching the movie.

166
00:11:09,220 --> 00:11:17,740
I like watching the behind the scenes because it shows you the Herculean effort that a lot

167
00:11:17,740 --> 00:11:21,620
of people put for a better part of 10 years.

168
00:11:21,620 --> 00:11:29,820
And if you look at the entire sort of like vast variety of like production and cast from

169
00:11:29,860 --> 00:11:35,300
top to bottom, everybody poured their soul into that that piece of work.

170
00:11:35,940 --> 00:11:41,140
And I love seeing that because that's what art takes.

171
00:11:41,140 --> 00:11:46,460
As you know, you know, that's what art takes is that it takes almost everything out of

172
00:11:46,460 --> 00:11:51,940
you for you to create something beautiful, something that a lot of people can identify

173
00:11:51,940 --> 00:11:55,340
with. And I don't mean identify in the identity perspective.

174
00:11:55,380 --> 00:12:01,060
I mean, from the humanist experience perspective, and you see that that, you know, Peter Jackson

175
00:12:01,060 --> 00:12:05,340
set the tone of the main push behind that whole project.

176
00:12:05,580 --> 00:12:10,700
And everyone followed suit, all the production people, all the artists, you know, they even

177
00:12:10,700 --> 00:12:17,300
thought about that the cultural significance of what it means to be from Rohan and how

178
00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:22,100
significant horses would be and where, you know, farmland would be placed.

179
00:12:22,100 --> 00:12:25,780
They thought about all those little details versus what would it be like for Gondor?

180
00:12:26,020 --> 00:12:30,780
I mean, that's how how much that they really put put thought into that.

181
00:12:30,780 --> 00:12:36,060
And it showed, even if you didn't catch every little detail, it showed in the project as a whole.

182
00:12:36,300 --> 00:12:42,620
And it transformed all of their lives, the art and their their willingness to engage

183
00:12:42,620 --> 00:12:47,580
with that art, transform their lives, but it transformed so many millions and millions

184
00:12:47,580 --> 00:12:51,620
of people watch that and continue and will continue forever to watch that and be

185
00:12:51,620 --> 00:12:52,860
transformed for it by it.

186
00:12:53,220 --> 00:13:00,020
And I don't enjoy that movie or that story because there's, you know, a brown

187
00:13:00,020 --> 00:13:07,380
girl who's happens to be Indian and an immigrant and is, you know, has has black hair

188
00:13:07,380 --> 00:13:09,980
and is nearsighted is in that movie.

189
00:13:10,260 --> 00:13:13,580
What value does that add to me?

190
00:13:14,020 --> 00:13:18,020
You know, and it's a very that's a very narcissistic perspective to say, I need the

191
00:13:18,020 --> 00:13:21,460
hero that's accomplishing great things to look just like me.

192
00:13:22,180 --> 00:13:26,900
That's such a that's such a surface level way to engage with a movie.

193
00:13:26,900 --> 00:13:29,500
But that's what modern movie makers really expect.

194
00:13:29,820 --> 00:13:30,420
And what is that?

195
00:13:30,420 --> 00:13:31,740
It comes back to that same idea.

196
00:13:32,020 --> 00:13:38,420
That's the easy thing to do and say, you should enjoy this movie because the

197
00:13:38,420 --> 00:13:40,020
heroine looks like you.

198
00:13:40,260 --> 00:13:44,140
And that's what the entire promotion for Echo was exactly that.

199
00:13:44,180 --> 00:13:47,060
It was our main character is deaf.

200
00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:48,020
Our main character is deaf.

201
00:13:48,060 --> 00:13:49,260
It's she's indigenous.

202
00:13:49,260 --> 00:13:49,860
She's this.

203
00:13:49,860 --> 00:13:50,820
She's body positive.

204
00:13:50,820 --> 00:13:51,220
She's this.

205
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:57,620
It's just all these little things that are so easy to do is the main promotion of

206
00:13:57,620 --> 00:14:00,100
that TV of that TV show.

207
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:06,180
But the actual value that's that someone might be able to get to see a story that

208
00:14:06,180 --> 00:14:10,100
transcends time, that transcends space, but speaks to that human experience of what

209
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:12,020
does it take to do something really hard?

210
00:14:12,300 --> 00:14:15,460
Lord of the Rings, what does it take to do a really difficult task?

211
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:17,340
And how does it change you?

212
00:14:17,340 --> 00:14:21,660
How does it, how does it, what does it mean to go up against evil?

213
00:14:21,980 --> 00:14:25,740
And how can that evil touch your heart and almost destroy you, almost kill you in

214
00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:26,500
that process?

215
00:14:26,860 --> 00:14:30,660
I mean, that's the human story that a lot of people connect with.

216
00:14:32,180 --> 00:14:38,740
And so I think that's really the problem is that there's not that willingness to

217
00:14:38,740 --> 00:14:45,380
do the hard thing because there's a lack of recognition that that it's even

218
00:14:45,380 --> 00:14:46,220
worth the doing.

219
00:14:46,540 --> 00:14:47,860
It's like, just take the easier route.

220
00:14:48,580 --> 00:14:50,100
Just go for representation.

221
00:14:50,540 --> 00:14:54,380
And that's, and there's a whole group of people that are reinforcing that

222
00:14:54,380 --> 00:14:57,140
perspective amongst those writer rooms.

223
00:14:59,820 --> 00:15:00,980
Wow, you just said it all.

224
00:15:01,380 --> 00:15:04,700
You just hit so many different things that I want to talk about.

225
00:15:05,260 --> 00:15:09,940
Um, and I think at the core of it, the, the writing is, is really falling off a

226
00:15:09,940 --> 00:15:13,180
cliff and they don't have anything new to say.

227
00:15:13,540 --> 00:15:15,140
They're not telling any new stories.

228
00:15:15,980 --> 00:15:17,900
They're not speaking to these universal truth.

229
00:15:18,580 --> 00:15:23,740
And perhaps that's why they're so focused on these materialistic identity

230
00:15:23,740 --> 00:15:29,300
things, because if you take that identity aspect away from it, what is it?

231
00:15:29,300 --> 00:15:31,860
It's just an empty, there's nothing behind that.

232
00:15:32,540 --> 00:15:36,340
So perhaps that's why they are pushing that so hard because that's the only

233
00:15:36,340 --> 00:15:37,740
new thing they're bringing to the table.

234
00:15:38,900 --> 00:15:42,140
Otherwise it's like, well, why are you making this movie that nobody asked for?

235
00:15:43,020 --> 00:15:47,420
We're making it because the genitalia of the new care of the main character is

236
00:15:47,420 --> 00:15:47,740
different.

237
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:50,060
That's why we have to remake this $300 million movie.

238
00:15:50,780 --> 00:15:54,060
And it's like, okay, I guess if it's that important to you, I guess it's worth

239
00:15:54,060 --> 00:15:58,740
remaking, but I love that you spoke about Lord of the Rings because that's

240
00:15:59,180 --> 00:16:00,620
my favorite movie by far.

241
00:16:01,300 --> 00:16:06,180
And I think I've literally watched that same behind the scenes video and I

242
00:16:06,180 --> 00:16:08,780
can't watch Lord of the Rings without pointing out like, you don't want to

243
00:16:08,780 --> 00:16:12,540
watch Lord of the Rings with me because I'm going to be like, Viggo Mortensen

244
00:16:12,540 --> 00:16:15,020
broke his foot in this scene, you know, he broke his toe.

245
00:16:15,540 --> 00:16:18,740
That's the first thing I thought I was like, you know, I think the same thing.

246
00:16:18,740 --> 00:16:19,100
Yeah.

247
00:16:19,340 --> 00:16:20,340
Like, did you know?

248
00:16:20,420 --> 00:16:20,900
Yeah.

249
00:16:22,100 --> 00:16:22,340
Yeah.

250
00:16:22,340 --> 00:16:23,140
I'm in the same way.

251
00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:27,180
Lord of the Rings is so deep and so good.

252
00:16:27,180 --> 00:16:28,940
It's such a, it's a symmetrical story.

253
00:16:28,980 --> 00:16:32,820
You have like nine members of the fellowship and then you have these nine

254
00:16:32,820 --> 00:16:36,860
Nazgul who are like the shadow side of them chasing them and then you have the

255
00:16:36,860 --> 00:16:39,260
good wizard and then you have the dark wizard.

256
00:16:39,820 --> 00:16:42,780
And then you have like elves and dwarves that contradict each other.

257
00:16:43,340 --> 00:16:47,340
And then the Urukay, the orcs are like literally dark elves.

258
00:16:47,340 --> 00:16:50,180
They are like dug up from the earth and they are elves.

259
00:16:50,180 --> 00:16:56,860
So it's like, it's almost like a perfect symmetrical psychological mind, the story.

260
00:16:56,860 --> 00:16:58,780
It's like, there's a dark side and there's a light side.

261
00:16:59,220 --> 00:17:01,940
And without the dark side, what is the Shire?

262
00:17:02,020 --> 00:17:05,820
The Shire is like nothing without the dark side, but because the dark is so dark

263
00:17:05,820 --> 00:17:11,260
in that story, the good is so good, you know, that the anti-hero defines the heroes.

264
00:17:12,140 --> 00:17:16,980
And, um, I never thought about it that way, I never thought about it that way.

265
00:17:16,980 --> 00:17:18,660
I never thought about the symmetry.

266
00:17:18,740 --> 00:17:19,740
That's very interesting.

267
00:17:19,740 --> 00:17:21,140
That's, and so true.

268
00:17:21,340 --> 00:17:22,740
I never, I never looked at it that way.

269
00:17:22,980 --> 00:17:25,500
Really good stories have great symmetry.

270
00:17:25,940 --> 00:17:28,340
Like I've, I've been rewatching Breaking Bad.

271
00:17:29,100 --> 00:17:34,540
And that story is very similar because Walter White is sick and he's kind

272
00:17:34,540 --> 00:17:38,620
of dying, he's on his way out, but at the same time, his wife is pregnant.

273
00:17:38,660 --> 00:17:39,860
She's bringing life in.

274
00:17:40,420 --> 00:17:42,660
So you have this nice symmetry to the story.

275
00:17:42,660 --> 00:17:49,380
You have his son in the above world, which is the, his son with his wife.

276
00:17:49,380 --> 00:17:52,420
And then he has his son in the dark world, which is Jesse.

277
00:17:53,540 --> 00:17:58,900
It's, um, and then every character in the dark world has good qualities.

278
00:17:59,100 --> 00:18:03,860
And every character in the above world has these dark qualities, like his

279
00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:07,700
sister-in-law steals, you know, everybody does these like things that you're like,

280
00:18:07,700 --> 00:18:08,900
maybe they're not so good.

281
00:18:08,900 --> 00:18:10,340
Maybe all the good people aren't so good.

282
00:18:10,900 --> 00:18:15,180
And he's got this like shadow side that he taps into and whenever he does that,

283
00:18:15,180 --> 00:18:16,500
you're like, yes, come on, Walter.

284
00:18:18,420 --> 00:18:20,460
Well, I, I didn't, I never looked at that.

285
00:18:20,460 --> 00:18:24,060
So that's, that's the thing I, you know, I, that's, that's amazing.

286
00:18:24,060 --> 00:18:24,540
I love that.

287
00:18:24,540 --> 00:18:28,460
I can see why then you appreciate these things even more, you know,

288
00:18:28,460 --> 00:18:30,100
seeing the deep layers of everything.

289
00:18:31,100 --> 00:18:31,500
Yes.

290
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:34,620
And, and like you were saying with, with modern movies, there, there

291
00:18:34,620 --> 00:18:36,820
isn't really much thought to like the symmetry.

292
00:18:36,820 --> 00:18:38,140
It's very one dimensional.

293
00:18:38,140 --> 00:18:42,140
Like you see a white guy on the screen and you're like, okay, he's the bad guy.

294
00:18:43,140 --> 00:18:43,500
All right.

295
00:18:43,740 --> 00:18:46,300
And you don't get much more depth to that.

296
00:18:47,060 --> 00:18:48,740
No, no, you don't.

297
00:18:49,140 --> 00:18:53,460
And the, what you were saying, you know, you can see with the writing around the

298
00:18:53,460 --> 00:18:56,620
laziness of everything, you know, taking the easy route for everything.

299
00:18:57,260 --> 00:19:02,380
And, um, one of the things that I hate that, that's kind of come along

300
00:19:02,380 --> 00:19:08,140
with is the amount of cursing in, in every, every single, um, script.

301
00:19:08,620 --> 00:19:12,220
Because so, you know, there's some comedians that'll say, you know, I'm

302
00:19:12,220 --> 00:19:14,180
going to work clean, like Will Smith is one of them.

303
00:19:14,180 --> 00:19:16,140
He, he always said that he was going to work clean.

304
00:19:16,180 --> 00:19:20,700
I obviously broke that cursing, like crazy during the Oscar night.

305
00:19:20,740 --> 00:19:24,420
Um, but he's, he's always been one of those people who says like, I'm not

306
00:19:24,460 --> 00:19:25,060
going to curse.

307
00:19:25,060 --> 00:19:32,180
And, and I think with cursing, it's very easy to convey anger by just

308
00:19:32,180 --> 00:19:34,180
using certain four letter words.

309
00:19:34,740 --> 00:19:38,340
Um, it takes a lot of effort to convey it otherwise.

310
00:19:38,340 --> 00:19:40,980
And I think that's again, one of those things that really bothers me about

311
00:19:40,980 --> 00:19:46,420
like every now, you know, new TV show has cursing in it rather than actually

312
00:19:46,620 --> 00:19:52,420
working with the language, the English language to create, create dialogue

313
00:19:52,420 --> 00:19:56,100
that's engaging and interesting and like gives you full nuance of someone's

314
00:19:56,100 --> 00:19:59,980
character and feelings without having to rely on something like that.

315
00:20:00,060 --> 00:20:02,820
Which is what was nice about network TV in the past is that that's

316
00:20:02,820 --> 00:20:04,980
what it kind of demanded.

317
00:20:04,980 --> 00:20:05,900
It said, you can't curse.

318
00:20:05,900 --> 00:20:09,900
So a lot of people, but that limitation had to make sure that they

319
00:20:09,900 --> 00:20:13,100
were going to be really good at, at their mastery of the English language.

320
00:20:13,420 --> 00:20:16,540
And that's now without that limitation, people just kind of go with them,

321
00:20:16,660 --> 00:20:17,940
you know, lowest denominator.

322
00:20:18,260 --> 00:20:21,900
Again, I know that I sound like such a, such a, you know, buddy,

323
00:20:21,900 --> 00:20:26,420
daddy saying stuff like that, but I just really want to defend the English language.

324
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:32,500
Well, I, I completely agree with you because if you don't have a lot of

325
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:35,700
cursing, when, and you do have cursing, it, it really has weight to it.

326
00:20:36,700 --> 00:20:40,180
I have seen that where there's certain shows where they're saying the F

327
00:20:40,180 --> 00:20:43,660
word in every other sentence and it's kind of like, it just becomes a filler word.

328
00:20:44,380 --> 00:20:44,820
Yes.

329
00:20:44,820 --> 00:20:46,660
Kind of like the word like, you know.

330
00:20:47,140 --> 00:20:47,500
Yeah.

331
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:48,780
It's in succession.

332
00:20:48,780 --> 00:20:51,740
That's one of the reasons I couldn't get into succession is that every

333
00:20:51,740 --> 00:20:53,140
other word was the F word.

334
00:20:53,820 --> 00:21:00,420
And what I liked about, um, what was interesting about Sex and the City was

335
00:21:00,420 --> 00:21:05,620
that there's a, I mean gratuitous amount of, uh, you know, sex scenes and nudity

336
00:21:05,620 --> 00:21:06,500
and all this stuff.

337
00:21:06,860 --> 00:21:09,780
But when it came to Sarah Jessica Parker's character, one of the things

338
00:21:09,780 --> 00:21:14,740
she said when they started working on that, she said, I know it's HBO and

339
00:21:14,740 --> 00:21:19,740
we can do anything, but I feel like my character being a writer should not be

340
00:21:19,740 --> 00:21:24,020
cursing all the time, that when she does curse, like you're saying, it adds that

341
00:21:24,020 --> 00:21:26,980
weight to it because that's the point is that she's a writer.

342
00:21:26,980 --> 00:21:30,460
She's, she should be good at communicating her emotions without having to

343
00:21:31,340 --> 00:21:35,900
devolve to that or resolve to that resort.

344
00:21:35,900 --> 00:21:36,140
Sorry.

345
00:21:36,140 --> 00:21:37,260
That's the word I was trying to think of.

346
00:21:37,620 --> 00:21:43,260
And so what those times that she would say, you know what F him that like hit

347
00:21:43,260 --> 00:21:47,380
really hard because that's, that was atypical for her to say something like

348
00:21:47,380 --> 00:21:50,740
that, you know, I, I am a big fan of that show.

349
00:21:51,020 --> 00:21:56,980
You are has, and like you were saying before, um, it has universal truths.

350
00:21:57,460 --> 00:22:01,500
So you don't have to look exactly like the people in the show to get it.

351
00:22:02,220 --> 00:22:06,820
And the swearing aspect, I remember the first episode of that show had the best

352
00:22:06,820 --> 00:22:10,260
writing of any show I've ever seen because she asked Mr.

353
00:22:10,260 --> 00:22:12,540
Big, have you ever been in love?

354
00:22:13,420 --> 00:22:15,460
And he says abs a fucking Lutley.

355
00:22:15,820 --> 00:22:16,140
Yeah.

356
00:22:16,340 --> 00:22:20,740
And you, you're like, okay, this is not going to be a traditional romance show

357
00:22:20,780 --> 00:22:26,180
because he just swore while talking about something that's very traditionally

358
00:22:26,180 --> 00:22:27,460
romantic, but he just swore.

359
00:22:27,460 --> 00:22:29,420
So this is not going to be that type of story.

360
00:22:29,980 --> 00:22:30,380
Right.

361
00:22:31,020 --> 00:22:32,820
I could go on on that show as well.

362
00:22:33,260 --> 00:22:33,500
Yeah.

363
00:22:33,500 --> 00:22:35,620
The writing for that show is really good.

364
00:22:35,940 --> 00:22:37,900
It is incredibly good.

365
00:22:38,340 --> 00:22:43,100
As good as that writing is, it's exactly the opposite when it comes to the reboot.

366
00:22:43,420 --> 00:22:49,420
And just like that is so poorly written, you can just see, yeah, you can just

367
00:22:49,420 --> 00:22:53,660
see sort of the evolution of, of writer rooms just from that.

368
00:22:53,660 --> 00:22:57,500
Because I think it's a lot of the same people still involved, but you can just

369
00:22:57,500 --> 00:23:01,740
see how the situation has really changed and, and talent has sort of devolved.

370
00:23:02,780 --> 00:23:03,100
Yeah.

371
00:23:03,380 --> 00:23:03,620
Yeah.

372
00:23:03,620 --> 00:23:07,140
Well, I think that show got consumed by identity politics as well.

373
00:23:07,700 --> 00:23:08,100
Yes.

374
00:23:08,700 --> 00:23:09,180
Yes.

375
00:23:09,460 --> 00:23:10,100
I mean, Mr.

376
00:23:10,100 --> 00:23:12,380
Big technically is canceled.

377
00:23:12,420 --> 00:23:15,100
Forget Chris Knoth, the actor who plays Mr.

378
00:23:15,100 --> 00:23:16,980
Big, but Mr.

379
00:23:16,980 --> 00:23:18,460
Big, the idea of Mr.

380
00:23:18,460 --> 00:23:24,420
Big is unacceptable in, in today's world because, you know, he's, he, he is what

381
00:23:25,660 --> 00:23:29,700
he represented everything that was emblematic of New York in the 90s, right?

382
00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:35,900
Extremely kind of bigger, larger than life, uh, you know, uh, very masculine,

383
00:23:35,940 --> 00:23:41,860
very sort of has his own way to everything very intrans, intransigent, uh,

384
00:23:41,860 --> 00:23:47,780
and extremely, uh, rich, which is like what the whole show is about.

385
00:23:47,780 --> 00:23:52,500
The whole show is about consumerism, you know, essentially it's about shoes.

386
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:54,780
It's about all the best clothing.

387
00:23:54,780 --> 00:23:59,700
I mean, that was so much about it, but also about trying to find love at a time

388
00:24:00,060 --> 00:24:03,420
where New York was kind of past love, right?

389
00:24:03,420 --> 00:24:04,460
Past romance.

390
00:24:05,020 --> 00:24:09,740
And so it's, it's interesting because now they're trying to kind of, you know,

391
00:24:09,740 --> 00:24:11,380
they, they participate in all that.

392
00:24:11,540 --> 00:24:15,300
And now they're trying to prove that they've evolved beyond all of it.

393
00:24:15,540 --> 00:24:20,500
And, uh, you know, think that by killing off of a character, an iconic character,

394
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:23,700
they can kind of claim moral high ground.

395
00:24:26,100 --> 00:24:26,460
Yeah.

396
00:24:26,460 --> 00:24:32,460
I've noticed that there's been a decline of, of romance in media and just in

397
00:24:32,460 --> 00:24:36,820
general, um, you can even look at like statistics with Gen Z.

398
00:24:37,260 --> 00:24:37,620
Yes.

399
00:24:37,620 --> 00:24:39,620
There's less romance, less children.

400
00:24:40,060 --> 00:24:44,300
Um, yeah, what, what do you think that's about less romance?

401
00:24:46,460 --> 00:24:50,620
I think so this is, this is actually kind of perfect to talk about because I've

402
00:24:50,620 --> 00:24:56,460
been, uh, neck deep in this feminist video that I seem to be working on forever.

403
00:24:56,460 --> 00:25:00,940
I started writing it in December and I'm finally, I think almost done with the

404
00:25:00,940 --> 00:25:05,420
editing and, uh, what, as part of that, so the question I've been trying to

405
00:25:05,420 --> 00:25:10,900
answer is like, how has feminism helped our society and how has it hurt it?

406
00:25:11,060 --> 00:25:16,220
Because I think we tend to take, at least out in the open, people tend to take a

407
00:25:16,220 --> 00:25:18,260
very sort of polarized view on everything.

408
00:25:18,260 --> 00:25:20,420
Oh, feminism sucks or feminism is great.

409
00:25:20,700 --> 00:25:23,780
What about the middle ground is kind of what I wanted to dive into.

410
00:25:24,460 --> 00:25:29,420
And so as part of that, I've read a lot of the writings of, of feminist thinkers,

411
00:25:29,860 --> 00:25:31,580
you know, across the 20th century.

412
00:25:31,580 --> 00:25:38,660
And the one that I found that I found to be the strangest was this woman called,

413
00:25:38,700 --> 00:25:41,460
uh, fire, uh, Shula myth firestone.

414
00:25:41,860 --> 00:25:47,460
And she, uh, you know, passed away recently in 2012, she, but in, in the 1970s,

415
00:25:47,460 --> 00:25:50,820
she was quite active and she wrote this book called the dialectic of sex.

416
00:25:51,420 --> 00:25:58,340
And in that she laid out what the future needed to look like, excuse me.

417
00:26:00,020 --> 00:26:05,260
Needed to look like in order for it to actually be fair for men and women.

418
00:26:05,980 --> 00:26:10,340
And she was building on a lot of the ideas that previous, um, previous feminists

419
00:26:10,340 --> 00:26:14,540
had had come out with, but there were a couple of points that she made.

420
00:26:15,060 --> 00:26:20,740
And one of them was around, um, around men and women just being indistinguishable,

421
00:26:21,420 --> 00:26:24,740
uh, physically, that they should be indistinguishable, that you should not be

422
00:26:24,740 --> 00:26:29,780
able to tell, um, the difference, and that women should not be responsible

423
00:26:29,780 --> 00:26:34,620
for bearing children, uh, because of the pain and anguish attached to that.

424
00:26:35,180 --> 00:26:40,260
And that, um, children should be bought, born in pods, little, little, you know,

425
00:26:40,460 --> 00:26:45,420
pods outside of women's bodies and that children should not even be raised

426
00:26:45,420 --> 00:26:47,380
by their genetic parents.

427
00:26:48,100 --> 00:26:53,300
Um, so, and that, and that the nuclear family should be eradicated.

428
00:26:54,140 --> 00:26:59,140
So there, all these ideas, and this was pretty consistent with sort of other

429
00:26:59,140 --> 00:27:03,100
thinkers, yes, she pushed it even further, uh, by saying that women should, you

430
00:27:03,100 --> 00:27:06,820
know, should not bear children period, but there were a lot of feminist thinkers

431
00:27:06,820 --> 00:27:11,300
before her, uh, starting from the sixties that were suggesting that women should

432
00:27:11,300 --> 00:27:17,620
not engage in, in sort of motherhood and family and in relationships with men,

433
00:27:17,620 --> 00:27:25,020
that that was the ultimate, um, feminist move was to just reject any sort of

434
00:27:25,020 --> 00:27:26,220
relationship with men.

435
00:27:26,540 --> 00:27:29,580
And many of them suggested then, okay, well, how do you fix loneliness?

436
00:27:29,580 --> 00:27:32,740
Oh, it's like, oh, engage in lesbianism is, was sort of the answer.

437
00:27:33,300 --> 00:27:38,020
Um, so it's that whole idea that women are so much happier without men and men

438
00:27:38,020 --> 00:27:39,740
are just useless and get rid of them.

439
00:27:39,740 --> 00:27:43,620
And, you know, they're just responsible for the patriarchy and, and, uh, up,

440
00:27:43,660 --> 00:27:47,540
up, and the whole, whole, whole board by not even engaging with them.

441
00:27:47,940 --> 00:27:53,140
So I think that sort of thinking has been making its way and trickling into

442
00:27:53,140 --> 00:27:58,900
various parts of, of sort of the teachings that, that, you know, children go

443
00:27:58,900 --> 00:28:02,780
through when they go, go through college, that they, they get indoctrinated with

444
00:28:02,780 --> 00:28:07,700
this idea that it's men and it's women and we're against each other.

445
00:28:07,700 --> 00:28:10,340
And, you know, there can be only one winner.

446
00:28:10,820 --> 00:28:13,980
You know, you don't need to engage with the other side.

447
00:28:13,980 --> 00:28:15,260
You don't need to compromise.

448
00:28:15,260 --> 00:28:17,180
You don't need to find a way to work together.

449
00:28:17,180 --> 00:28:19,860
You don't need to build partnerships with the other, other sex.

450
00:28:20,180 --> 00:28:25,180
It's just, you know, it's going to be one winner and it's going to be women.

451
00:28:25,660 --> 00:28:30,940
And I think as part of that, then you're seeing those types of thinkers, you know,

452
00:28:30,940 --> 00:28:36,060
the, the, the sort of disciples of those, that sort of thinking, then entering

453
00:28:36,140 --> 00:28:36,940
writer's room.

454
00:28:36,940 --> 00:28:41,380
So any sort of modern writing is not about romance at all.

455
00:28:41,420 --> 00:28:42,980
It's actually about domination.

456
00:28:43,340 --> 00:28:46,780
So Captain Marvel has no love interest.

457
00:28:46,860 --> 00:28:52,980
Her only marriage is because, you know, she's, um, she's, I think, made a political

458
00:28:52,980 --> 00:28:55,860
alliance or something in the, in the new Marvel movie.

459
00:28:55,860 --> 00:28:57,660
I don't know if you saw that, the Marvels.

460
00:28:58,220 --> 00:29:02,700
And yeah, oh, you probably saved yourself some time and time and money.

461
00:29:02,740 --> 00:29:03,460
I couldn't do it.

462
00:29:04,380 --> 00:29:09,700
There was, uh, uh, uh, an extra scene.

463
00:29:09,740 --> 00:29:11,860
I don't know why I'm forgetting the word that deleted scene.

464
00:29:11,860 --> 00:29:12,260
There you go.

465
00:29:12,740 --> 00:29:19,300
That, uh, nerd Roddick showed on his channel and, uh, in the deleted scene,

466
00:29:19,860 --> 00:29:25,580
there was this like very inappropriate lesbian joke made by one character to

467
00:29:25,580 --> 00:29:26,780
another, who's underage.

468
00:29:27,460 --> 00:29:33,340
So it's very obvious that that, all of that sort of perspective on just cut men

469
00:29:33,340 --> 00:29:37,980
out is very strong within the writers and they're just trying to insert it

470
00:29:38,020 --> 00:29:39,060
anywhere possible.

471
00:29:39,420 --> 00:29:45,460
And so it's old fashioned to be in love with a man and want to form a good

472
00:29:45,460 --> 00:29:46,460
partnership with him.

473
00:29:46,460 --> 00:29:47,140
It's old fashioned.

474
00:29:47,140 --> 00:29:49,100
It's anti feminist to do that.

475
00:29:49,420 --> 00:29:51,260
It's anti woman to do that.

476
00:29:51,620 --> 00:29:57,580
And you see that even, uh, surface up with that, uh, Rachel Zegler interview

477
00:29:57,820 --> 00:30:02,780
where she says, um, you know, there's a big focus on her love story.

478
00:30:03,260 --> 00:30:05,180
And she's so sarcastic about it.

479
00:30:05,180 --> 00:30:11,140
She's so irritated about it, despite she herself having a boyfriend that she

480
00:30:11,140 --> 00:30:12,940
often talks about in references.

481
00:30:13,380 --> 00:30:17,140
Uh, and she talks about how the prince could be completely cut from the story.

482
00:30:17,140 --> 00:30:17,460
Right.

483
00:30:17,460 --> 00:30:22,780
It's, it's who cares about love when there's power to be had, right?

484
00:30:23,180 --> 00:30:26,020
And that's one of those things that's very interesting is that that's what.

485
00:30:26,540 --> 00:30:31,220
Feminists think of the patriarchy, that the patriarchy only cares about power

486
00:30:31,260 --> 00:30:32,460
and they don't care about love.

487
00:30:33,020 --> 00:30:36,780
Um, and that's their, that's the very, I think very, you know, we can dive

488
00:30:36,780 --> 00:30:42,260
into the patriarchy whenever, but that's a very simple, overly simplistic, uh,

489
00:30:42,740 --> 00:30:44,740
understanding of how men think.

490
00:30:45,260 --> 00:30:50,140
And so that's, this is their counteraction to that and saying love is a distraction.

491
00:30:50,340 --> 00:30:53,340
Love requires compromise.

492
00:30:53,580 --> 00:30:56,300
It requires, uh, sacrifice.

493
00:30:56,660 --> 00:31:00,420
Um, so why would an individual do that, especially if we're pushing for a

494
00:31:00,420 --> 00:31:04,380
very self-first perspective and philosophy in life?

495
00:31:04,820 --> 00:31:11,420
So instead we should say, F love, we should go and seek power and leadership.

496
00:31:12,380 --> 00:31:12,980
Yikes.

497
00:31:13,220 --> 00:31:18,060
Well, it seems like the actions are driven entirely by resentment.

498
00:31:19,020 --> 00:31:23,740
You know, there's no, I've heard that you're either driven by gratitude or by resentment.

499
00:31:24,420 --> 00:31:27,540
And I think it's very clear that the people creating these movies are

500
00:31:27,540 --> 00:31:28,900
driven by resentment now.

501
00:31:29,460 --> 00:31:33,980
It's like all about what power do they lack or, you know, how they've been

502
00:31:33,980 --> 00:31:37,460
wronged and it all stems from, to me, it all stems from narcissism.

503
00:31:38,140 --> 00:31:40,220
Cause there's two types of narcissism.

504
00:31:40,980 --> 00:31:45,060
There's the, the form where you think everybody's better than you.

505
00:31:45,500 --> 00:31:47,180
So you were entitled to what they have.

506
00:31:48,060 --> 00:31:53,100
You, you need to be leveled out or you believe that you are better than everybody

507
00:31:53,100 --> 00:31:54,700
else and you're entitled as well.

508
00:31:54,700 --> 00:31:59,860
Like both, both views lead to entitlement and that you're better than

509
00:31:59,860 --> 00:32:01,940
it, you know, that you come first.

510
00:32:02,340 --> 00:32:02,620
Yeah.

511
00:32:02,820 --> 00:32:06,140
And so you see that in, in the way that the characters in these movies behave.

512
00:32:06,740 --> 00:32:09,420
It's this resentful narcissism.

513
00:32:10,540 --> 00:32:14,740
And I don't think it's really connecting with audiences anymore, because if

514
00:32:14,740 --> 00:32:19,380
you're looking at the numbers, it's been like flop after flop after flop with

515
00:32:19,380 --> 00:32:21,460
these huge budget films.

516
00:32:21,460 --> 00:32:24,940
So they're going to either have to correct their mistakes.

517
00:32:24,940 --> 00:32:28,460
So they're just going to, they're going to not be able to sustain this, right?

518
00:32:28,980 --> 00:32:30,260
Yeah, absolutely.

519
00:32:30,260 --> 00:32:35,700
And, um, I think they're going to keep going for some time because the thing

520
00:32:35,700 --> 00:32:40,460
is wokeness and I know we'll, we'll, we'll touch on some of this stuff of how

521
00:32:40,460 --> 00:32:47,740
it's going to sort of infected companies and cities later, but wokeness is, is

522
00:32:47,740 --> 00:32:54,220
such, um, such an infection in that once it enters certain environments, it's

523
00:32:54,220 --> 00:32:56,500
very hard to argue against.

524
00:32:57,060 --> 00:33:01,940
It's very hard to overthrow and because it's very easy for people who are

525
00:33:01,940 --> 00:33:07,580
willing to play that woke game, it's very easy for them to destroy other

526
00:33:07,580 --> 00:33:11,180
people's reputations by casting aspersions on their character and calling

527
00:33:11,180 --> 00:33:16,500
them racist and bigoted and, and those sorts of, those sorts of terms really

528
00:33:16,500 --> 00:33:21,540
stick, you know, you, you say that enough, enough people say it, um, you know, it's

529
00:33:21,540 --> 00:33:23,940
very destructive on an individual level.

530
00:33:23,940 --> 00:33:27,020
So why would someone sort of stand up to that?

531
00:33:27,260 --> 00:33:31,900
And so you just need one or two bad actors from, from a wokeness side to

532
00:33:31,900 --> 00:33:33,900
kind of overthrow an entire organization.

533
00:33:34,140 --> 00:33:38,060
It's really not that, not that hard because we live in a polite society.

534
00:33:38,060 --> 00:33:39,140
We don't want to offend.

535
00:33:39,580 --> 00:33:40,900
Uh, we're not brutes.

536
00:33:41,100 --> 00:33:45,420
So it's almost like the strengths, the greatest strengths of Western society

537
00:33:45,460 --> 00:33:48,620
are getting turned on itself, so to speak.

538
00:33:49,380 --> 00:33:54,540
And everything you're saying about the resentment aspect of it, you know, I

539
00:33:54,540 --> 00:33:58,500
think one of the best stories ever written is Groundhog Day.

540
00:33:58,820 --> 00:34:00,340
And I don't know if you've watched that movie.

541
00:34:00,500 --> 00:34:00,980
Have you?

542
00:34:01,420 --> 00:34:02,380
I have to now.

543
00:34:02,940 --> 00:34:06,860
You, and I think you'll really, I think you'll really enjoy it.

544
00:34:07,420 --> 00:34:11,820
And I, you know, without giving, well, you can give it away.

545
00:34:11,820 --> 00:34:12,500
I'll still watch it.

546
00:34:12,500 --> 00:34:18,380
Um, yeah, I don't want to get, I don't want to ruin the experience for you,

547
00:34:18,380 --> 00:34:23,100
but it's not, I mean, I think you can anticipate what the movie might be

548
00:34:23,100 --> 00:34:24,700
about the second you start watching it.

549
00:34:24,700 --> 00:34:29,380
But the, what's great about that movie is first of all, the premises

550
00:34:29,380 --> 00:34:33,820
that this man is waking up and reliving the same day over and over.

551
00:34:33,860 --> 00:34:36,980
So you must have heard that part, uh, because it's something, it's like

552
00:34:36,980 --> 00:34:41,900
a fun trope that he's literally replaying Groundhog Day every day.

553
00:34:41,900 --> 00:34:43,220
And he has no idea why.

554
00:34:44,020 --> 00:34:49,340
And when you meet the character, his name is Phil and, you know, played

555
00:34:49,340 --> 00:34:52,740
really well by, uh, Marie, right?

556
00:34:52,940 --> 00:34:53,420
Yes.

557
00:34:53,500 --> 00:34:53,780
Okay.

558
00:34:53,780 --> 00:34:55,060
I'm so glad you remembered his name.

559
00:34:55,420 --> 00:34:58,700
Uh, and he, you know, played so well by him.

560
00:34:59,060 --> 00:35:07,380
And when you meet him, he is this very resentful sort of narcissistic, um,

561
00:35:07,940 --> 00:35:12,180
self-aggrandizing type character and he's full of loathing.

562
00:35:12,180 --> 00:35:15,940
He, I mean, for everything, for life, for the world, people around him,

563
00:35:15,940 --> 00:35:19,460
his colleagues, uh, his job, everything.

564
00:35:19,940 --> 00:35:25,500
And so you see him live two particular days before the repeating starts.

565
00:35:25,820 --> 00:35:28,700
And when you see the second day that he lives, the one day that he

566
00:35:28,700 --> 00:35:31,980
keeps repeating over and over, you realize it's actually a really

567
00:35:31,980 --> 00:35:35,180
shitty day that he ends up living where he wakes up.

568
00:35:35,180 --> 00:35:37,500
He's, you know, he's here in this town.

569
00:35:37,500 --> 00:35:40,940
He's reporting on Groundhog Day and he wakes up.

570
00:35:40,940 --> 00:35:43,100
He's at an, at a BNB.

571
00:35:43,220 --> 00:35:44,580
It's a cold day.

572
00:35:44,580 --> 00:35:47,180
He's rude to the person he meets outside of his room.

573
00:35:47,180 --> 00:35:48,100
He mocks him.

574
00:35:48,380 --> 00:35:49,340
He goes downstairs.

575
00:35:49,340 --> 00:35:51,740
He's rude to the BNB owner.

576
00:35:51,780 --> 00:35:54,460
You know, she doesn't know what espresso is and he mocks her for that.

577
00:35:54,740 --> 00:35:59,460
He, he walks out, he sees some old man and he's who's asking for money.

578
00:35:59,460 --> 00:36:01,220
And he kind of mocks him as well.

579
00:36:01,460 --> 00:36:05,340
He tries to avoid this insurance salesman that he runs into who's

580
00:36:05,340 --> 00:36:08,260
an old, old student from his own, own school.

581
00:36:08,620 --> 00:36:13,460
He ends up getting, walking into a puddle, like a really cold, wet puddle.

582
00:36:13,460 --> 00:36:18,980
And like he's just having this terrible day and he comes, he gets to his job,

583
00:36:18,980 --> 00:36:20,260
he reports on it again.

584
00:36:20,260 --> 00:36:25,100
He's like sarcastically reporting on this job and, and you see him play

585
00:36:25,100 --> 00:36:31,540
out this whole day and it's like, what, what entity forced him to relive

586
00:36:31,540 --> 00:36:38,100
this day every, like for possibly years, like people estimate that that day he

587
00:36:38,100 --> 00:36:42,340
lived for maybe 10 years over and over is what people think.

588
00:36:42,340 --> 00:36:46,660
Like it's like thousands and thousands of times he's waking up, but it's,

589
00:36:46,740 --> 00:36:51,860
it's that we experience his experience, we experience his life for that one

590
00:36:51,860 --> 00:36:55,780
sliver of a day, but you can make that assumption that that's how he was living

591
00:36:55,780 --> 00:36:57,940
every single day of his life leading up to that.

592
00:36:58,460 --> 00:37:05,740
And the movie, as it evolves, forces him to rethink some things because

593
00:37:05,780 --> 00:37:09,860
there's just no out of sheer, you know, lack of choice.

594
00:37:10,340 --> 00:37:14,140
And suddenly he switches his perspective from being sort of the super

595
00:37:14,140 --> 00:37:19,940
silliest person or even hedonistic person to suddenly he's like, let me

596
00:37:19,940 --> 00:37:24,180
see if I can help people because I'm here and I see what they're up to.

597
00:37:24,660 --> 00:37:26,540
And suddenly he just starts helping people.

598
00:37:26,900 --> 00:37:28,860
He helps the old man that he comes across.

599
00:37:28,860 --> 00:37:34,060
He makes sure that he's warm and fed and he goes to, uh, he realizes that one

600
00:37:34,060 --> 00:37:36,580
kid across the block like broke his leg.

601
00:37:36,580 --> 00:37:40,100
So he, every time, you know, he's about to break his leg every day.

602
00:37:40,100 --> 00:37:42,940
He's, he saves him and prevents him from breaking his leg.

603
00:37:43,260 --> 00:37:46,780
Unlike some old women get a flat tire and he goes and spends time on that.

604
00:37:46,780 --> 00:37:50,380
And that's just him helping people around the town, but he starts

605
00:37:50,380 --> 00:37:54,940
learning how to play the piano and he starts learning how to ice sculpt.

606
00:37:54,940 --> 00:37:58,300
And like, he starts reading French poetry and there are all these

607
00:37:58,300 --> 00:38:00,060
little things he starts engaging in.

608
00:38:00,580 --> 00:38:06,580
And then as a, as a result, it actually completely changes his perspective on life.

609
00:38:06,820 --> 00:38:12,020
And you, so you see from in the beginning, he lives this terrible, terrible day to

610
00:38:12,020 --> 00:38:16,740
suddenly the last day you see, he lives this wondrous day where he goes

611
00:38:16,740 --> 00:38:19,660
around reading everybody of their misery.

612
00:38:20,340 --> 00:38:26,140
And you realize that nothing has changed.

613
00:38:26,340 --> 00:38:28,660
It's not, it's like the day is exactly the same.

614
00:38:28,660 --> 00:38:29,940
Life is exactly the same.

615
00:38:30,140 --> 00:38:31,820
It's his perspective has changed.

616
00:38:31,820 --> 00:38:33,860
His effort into his life has changed.

617
00:38:34,180 --> 00:38:37,140
His, how he thinks about other people has changed.

618
00:38:37,140 --> 00:38:41,820
And he went from living this resentful, terrible life to actually a

619
00:38:41,820 --> 00:38:47,500
very fulfilling, thoughtful life where he's looked at by other people and

620
00:38:47,500 --> 00:38:48,740
respected by other people.

621
00:38:48,740 --> 00:38:51,660
But whereas before people couldn't give a damn about him.

622
00:38:52,220 --> 00:38:58,260
And the, the person who wrote this and the directors, they both said that they

623
00:38:58,260 --> 00:39:03,940
receive so many letters from across the globe saying, this is the perfect

624
00:39:04,820 --> 00:39:05,820
Buddhist movie.

625
00:39:05,820 --> 00:39:07,580
This is the perfect Hindu movie.

626
00:39:07,580 --> 00:39:09,620
This is the perfect Jewish movie.

627
00:39:09,620 --> 00:39:13,620
This is the perfect, you know, Christian movie, because they were talking about

628
00:39:13,620 --> 00:39:16,780
like what lessons that this, this movie was espousing.

629
00:39:17,180 --> 00:39:22,420
And the reality is it's actually the perfect, it's perfect universally because

630
00:39:22,420 --> 00:39:29,500
it could evade that basic idea that nothing you do in life is under your,

631
00:39:29,860 --> 00:39:34,460
sorry, life in general, what happens to you is mostly not under your control.

632
00:39:35,020 --> 00:39:37,660
It's what you, how you choose to engage with life.

633
00:39:37,660 --> 00:39:39,300
That's really important.

634
00:39:39,540 --> 00:39:43,900
And that idea is so universal that people across the globe are writing to him and

635
00:39:43,900 --> 00:39:47,860
saying, this really spoke to me, you know, this completely connected with me.

636
00:39:48,100 --> 00:39:48,700
And thank you.

637
00:39:48,700 --> 00:39:50,580
And, and, and that's the point.

638
00:39:50,620 --> 00:39:52,860
That's what makes a good story.

639
00:39:53,340 --> 00:39:55,620
And that's what makes a story transcend time.

640
00:39:56,180 --> 00:40:01,180
Is if it, if it gets to the core of like actually solving a very important question,

641
00:40:01,180 --> 00:40:06,100
which is how do you find a way to live a really good life despite the endless

642
00:40:06,100 --> 00:40:12,180
miseries of life, but also why then exploring why resentment is so attractive

643
00:40:12,180 --> 00:40:15,940
to it, to a lot of people and everybody goes through that, right?

644
00:40:16,060 --> 00:40:18,660
You could be the most optimistic person possible.

645
00:40:19,140 --> 00:40:21,860
And I'm, I'm a very optimistic person.

646
00:40:22,260 --> 00:40:25,740
But for the last four years, I had a very trying time.

647
00:40:25,740 --> 00:40:28,260
There were a lot of things that were happening in my life personally,

648
00:40:28,540 --> 00:40:32,580
including health issues and like family issues and all the stuff that it, I

649
00:40:32,580 --> 00:40:37,500
could see the door, I could see the door open for me to walk through and become

650
00:40:37,500 --> 00:40:39,060
this very resentful person.

651
00:40:39,500 --> 00:40:43,180
It's like that, there's always that attraction, but it takes that, it takes

652
00:40:43,180 --> 00:40:47,260
work to stay on the optimistic side and that at the end of the day, it just

653
00:40:47,300 --> 00:40:49,220
benefits you, you live a better life.

654
00:40:49,580 --> 00:40:52,740
If you engage with an optimistic perspective versus a, you know, a

655
00:40:52,740 --> 00:40:55,620
resentful, sort of angry one.

656
00:40:58,460 --> 00:41:03,020
Well, that's a beautiful analogy and I have so many thoughts.

657
00:41:04,100 --> 00:41:09,660
And the saying I say all the time is fate is what you are given.

658
00:41:10,180 --> 00:41:11,620
Destiny is what you make of it.

659
00:41:12,700 --> 00:41:13,820
And I like that.

660
00:41:14,300 --> 00:41:16,860
I think that speaks to two things are true at the same time.

661
00:41:17,740 --> 00:41:22,220
You are a product of your environment, but your environment is also a product of you.

662
00:41:23,180 --> 00:41:27,740
So when people get drawn towards that victim mindset, it's so attractive

663
00:41:27,740 --> 00:41:30,260
because it says, Hey, nothing's your fault.

664
00:41:30,780 --> 00:41:32,340
You're just a product of your environment.

665
00:41:33,060 --> 00:41:35,540
You didn't pick your genes or your parents or where you're born.

666
00:41:35,940 --> 00:41:37,380
So none of this is your fault.

667
00:41:38,220 --> 00:41:40,900
And you're like, yes, thank you.

668
00:41:40,900 --> 00:41:42,020
That, that is true.

669
00:41:42,140 --> 00:41:43,140
And it is true.

670
00:41:44,140 --> 00:41:48,540
But what is also true at the same time is your environment is a product of you.

671
00:41:49,420 --> 00:41:55,940
So you can enact free will and create the situation that you want to make it.

672
00:41:55,940 --> 00:41:57,500
And it all starts within your own mind.

673
00:41:58,260 --> 00:42:02,460
And that's kind of why we watch that movie, Groundhog Day in the first place.

674
00:42:02,900 --> 00:42:08,180
Cause if it was just him reliving the same day every day and there was no evolution

675
00:42:08,180 --> 00:42:10,140
of his mindset, why would we even watch it?

676
00:42:10,980 --> 00:42:14,660
That's kind of why we watch movies is to see this hero's journey play out.

677
00:42:15,220 --> 00:42:19,500
You know, they start in this resentful, bitter place like Thor or something.

678
00:42:20,340 --> 00:42:21,820
And then they have to learn this important lesson.

679
00:42:21,820 --> 00:42:25,660
And they come out on the other side, this evolved enlightened being.

680
00:42:26,500 --> 00:42:31,660
And I think that's what modern movies are missing so much is the characters don't develop.

681
00:42:32,300 --> 00:42:36,780
And in so many of the scenes, nothing is lost and nothing is gained.

682
00:42:37,300 --> 00:42:38,620
And you're kind of like sitting there.

683
00:42:38,620 --> 00:42:39,900
Why did I even watch this?

684
00:42:40,380 --> 00:42:44,420
Cause it's almost like the producer said, we need one more battle scene here.

685
00:42:44,940 --> 00:42:47,300
And they just inserted it after the movie was already made.

686
00:42:48,260 --> 00:42:50,620
And but, you know, nobody can die and nobody can get hurt.

687
00:42:50,620 --> 00:42:52,740
So because it can't impact the later scene.

688
00:42:53,540 --> 00:42:58,060
Whereas you think of a good movie, Lord of the Rings, every single battle,

689
00:42:58,060 --> 00:43:02,220
every line, every interaction, something is lost and something is gained.

690
00:43:02,740 --> 00:43:05,020
So you, you know, everything has weight to it.

691
00:43:05,220 --> 00:43:06,780
Everything becomes important.

692
00:43:07,700 --> 00:43:11,900
So yeah, that's, that's why we tune into these things to see that evolution.

693
00:43:12,460 --> 00:43:15,260
Yeah, yeah, I don't know what you said.

694
00:43:16,140 --> 00:43:18,180
Absolutely, absolutely agree with you.

695
00:43:18,180 --> 00:43:20,780
There's no, there's, yeah, there's, there are no stakes.

696
00:43:21,140 --> 00:43:26,020
And that's what's interesting about Echo is that not only are there no stakes,

697
00:43:26,580 --> 00:43:28,620
there are also no morals.

698
00:43:28,700 --> 00:43:33,580
You know, she wants, she wants to replace the crime boss that she used to work for.

699
00:43:33,580 --> 00:43:34,980
She's this assassin.

700
00:43:35,740 --> 00:43:40,940
And she, you know, she realizes that this man kind of betrayed her.

701
00:43:41,180 --> 00:43:44,420
So she goes and, you know, shoot some in the face.

702
00:43:44,980 --> 00:43:48,980
And now she wants to be, you know, run the ring herself.

703
00:43:49,220 --> 00:43:53,420
And there's no recognition that she's gone around killing people.

704
00:43:53,420 --> 00:43:57,500
There are no consequences for that, you know, there is no atonement for that.

705
00:43:57,820 --> 00:43:59,460
She's not really a hero.

706
00:44:00,380 --> 00:44:05,460
Um, she's only so because you're being told that she is so there's no actual

707
00:44:05,460 --> 00:44:07,140
morality attached to it.

708
00:44:07,380 --> 00:44:10,540
So that, and that's the other thing is that there's no sort of everything sort

709
00:44:10,540 --> 00:44:13,860
of murky on that side as well.

710
00:44:15,260 --> 00:44:21,100
Well, yeah, that's, that's also a sign of good story writing because the line

711
00:44:21,100 --> 00:44:23,020
between good and evil is not very simple.

712
00:44:23,580 --> 00:44:26,300
You know, you can't just put all the oppressors on one side and all the

713
00:44:26,300 --> 00:44:27,220
oppressed on the other.

714
00:44:28,060 --> 00:44:34,140
Um, the famous writer, Alexander Sultan, it's saying his name wrong, but he was

715
00:44:34,140 --> 00:44:36,260
the Russian writer that was in a gulag.

716
00:44:36,900 --> 00:44:42,100
He famously said that the line between good and evil runs between every human heart.

717
00:44:43,260 --> 00:44:47,900
And this was very profound for him to say, because he was at the mercy of these

718
00:44:47,900 --> 00:44:54,620
communist soldiers in a gulag and he was able to even see the humanity in them.

719
00:44:55,020 --> 00:44:58,660
And he was able to see that people that were right next to him in the camps

720
00:44:58,660 --> 00:45:00,500
were also had evil qualities.

721
00:45:00,500 --> 00:45:05,020
So it's like everybody, with just a few different tweaks of your

722
00:45:05,020 --> 00:45:09,220
circumstances, you could end up being that soldier at the gulag, or you could

723
00:45:09,220 --> 00:45:14,020
be a prisoner, you know, it's not clear who's good and who's bad.

724
00:45:14,540 --> 00:45:14,980
Right.

725
00:45:15,460 --> 00:45:22,500
And I think, um, I think there was a lot of black and white perspective on, on,

726
00:45:22,660 --> 00:45:26,700
you know, that could be achieved on, on the war when it came to World War II,

727
00:45:27,220 --> 00:45:30,620
because of this like mass imprisonment that happened of people.

728
00:45:31,060 --> 00:45:37,100
But everything that's happened geopolitically since is so nuanced that people crave,

729
00:45:37,140 --> 00:45:40,700
but people crave that black and white perspective is that they, they don't want

730
00:45:40,700 --> 00:45:42,460
it, you know, and I, I do too.

731
00:45:42,460 --> 00:45:44,580
I'm not, I'm not pinning it just on other people.

732
00:45:44,580 --> 00:45:48,700
I too wish that I could just say that person's evil and, you know, our country

733
00:45:48,700 --> 00:45:49,180
is great.

734
00:45:49,180 --> 00:45:54,380
And then that way I can just connect with our country's, um, national identity

735
00:45:54,380 --> 00:45:57,580
and never have to question it, you know, and I can just feel safe in the

736
00:45:57,580 --> 00:46:01,620
national identity, but everything is so murky, but people are often looking for

737
00:46:01,620 --> 00:46:05,500
that is that who's the bad guy and I want to be part of the good guys and, and

738
00:46:05,500 --> 00:46:06,620
just leave it at that.

739
00:46:08,420 --> 00:46:09,100
Very true.

740
00:46:09,100 --> 00:46:12,740
I think there was a point in American history where we did think that we were

741
00:46:12,740 --> 00:46:17,140
the good guys and we were absolutely sure that probably after World War II, we

742
00:46:17,180 --> 00:46:21,340
were patting ourselves on the back, but I think around Vietnam is when we

743
00:46:21,340 --> 00:46:24,020
realized actually we might be the bad guys.

744
00:46:24,580 --> 00:46:29,500
And I think a lot of that American innocence was ripped away in the 60s.

745
00:46:30,140 --> 00:46:30,500
Yes.

746
00:46:30,500 --> 00:46:35,220
And I think one of the things that makes me really sad is it was really

747
00:46:35,220 --> 00:46:40,460
interesting to watch, uh, Robert, uh, F Kennedy juniors, uh, podcasts.

748
00:46:40,460 --> 00:46:45,820
If you haven't watched, um, his talk, by the way, on Joe Rogan and Lex Freedman,

749
00:46:46,060 --> 00:46:47,340
just incredible.

750
00:46:47,860 --> 00:46:53,540
And he talks a lot about his father and his uncle and their assassinations and,

751
00:46:54,300 --> 00:47:00,780
but also how his father and his uncle really helped prevent the war escalation,

752
00:47:00,780 --> 00:47:07,180
the Cold War escalation with, uh, with Russia and the whole sort of machine kind

753
00:47:07,180 --> 00:47:13,260
of what Eisenhower warned us about the, the complex industry, uh, the military

754
00:47:13,260 --> 00:47:14,180
industrial complex.

755
00:47:14,220 --> 00:47:14,460
Yes.

756
00:47:14,460 --> 00:47:14,820
There you go.

757
00:47:15,540 --> 00:47:19,540
Uh, and the obsession with, with another, starting another war, that there was

758
00:47:19,540 --> 00:47:24,540
this whole machine trying to manipulate JFK into going to war.

759
00:47:25,180 --> 00:47:32,340
Um, and both RFK and JFK sort of coalesced and decided to try to deescalate

760
00:47:32,340 --> 00:47:35,020
it by just connecting with Gorbachev directly.

761
00:47:35,740 --> 00:47:41,020
And I think RFK ended up writing a letter to Gorbachev and talking about the

762
00:47:41,020 --> 00:47:42,860
importance of a future for their children.

763
00:47:42,860 --> 00:47:46,100
And Gorbachev being a father himself really connected with that.

764
00:47:46,460 --> 00:47:50,540
And RF, RFK Junior tells the story much better than I could do it justice.

765
00:47:50,540 --> 00:47:55,820
But what I found really sad about that is that here were two men that were

766
00:47:55,820 --> 00:48:00,140
thinking about rather than their legacy, cause they could have thought from the

767
00:48:00,140 --> 00:48:05,540
perspective of, you know, being those presidents that are waging into war and,

768
00:48:05,900 --> 00:48:10,820
and, you know, recognized as heroes and vanquishing the enemy, so to speak, and

769
00:48:10,820 --> 00:48:12,780
just cementing their legacy accordingly.

770
00:48:12,780 --> 00:48:16,660
And all they could think about instead was, you know, the people that, you

771
00:48:16,660 --> 00:48:20,100
know, millions of Russians will die, millions of Americans will die.

772
00:48:20,620 --> 00:48:24,540
And that that's more important than any individual's legacy.

773
00:48:25,340 --> 00:48:30,700
And knowing that these two men couldn't be sort of bamboozled into going into

774
00:48:30,700 --> 00:48:36,020
war, and there were many attempts made to convince our JFK to send troops to

775
00:48:36,020 --> 00:48:36,660
Vietnam.

776
00:48:36,660 --> 00:48:40,500
That was actually what RFK Junior talked about, that his, his uncle was

777
00:48:40,700 --> 00:48:44,100
really resisting starting a war with Vietnam.

778
00:48:44,780 --> 00:48:47,220
And that, that's when the assassination happened.

779
00:48:47,780 --> 00:48:53,620
You know, and after that, LBJ, the, the vice president got promoted.

780
00:48:54,140 --> 00:48:56,140
And very quickly we went into Vietnam.

781
00:48:56,500 --> 00:48:59,100
So you have to wonder sort of around that.

782
00:48:59,100 --> 00:49:03,220
I'm not making broad statements there, but you just have to kind of wonder what

783
00:49:03,220 --> 00:49:04,580
exactly was going on there.

784
00:49:04,900 --> 00:49:09,940
But that's so sad that, you know, these men looked at someone like

785
00:49:09,980 --> 00:49:15,540
JFK, who was essentially in that context, the best man among them, who was

786
00:49:15,540 --> 00:49:19,260
willing to think about greater good than, than their, than his own selfish

787
00:49:19,260 --> 00:49:19,900
desires.

788
00:49:20,660 --> 00:49:26,140
And they decided to get together and, and, you know, maybe get him out of the

789
00:49:26,140 --> 00:49:26,580
job.

790
00:49:27,260 --> 00:49:30,540
So that, and that's what happens, right?

791
00:49:30,540 --> 00:49:33,540
You, it takes one man to stand up to something like that, to prevent

792
00:49:33,540 --> 00:49:34,460
something bad like that.

793
00:49:34,460 --> 00:49:38,180
But that's, that's what moral degradation looks like, is that when good

794
00:49:38,180 --> 00:49:41,460
men are unable to, to do anything, to stop it, right?

795
00:49:41,460 --> 00:49:46,260
You don't, you have a room of, of like smokey cigars, just driving, you know,

796
00:49:46,260 --> 00:49:50,740
very sort of narcissistic, like selfish desires forward versus thinking about

797
00:49:50,740 --> 00:49:52,220
the bigger picture of things.

798
00:49:54,340 --> 00:49:54,660
Yeah.

799
00:49:54,660 --> 00:50:00,340
Well, it seems like we're at a point where the actions of our country,

800
00:50:00,940 --> 00:50:05,260
especially abroad globally, don't seem to be in the best interest of the

801
00:50:05,260 --> 00:50:11,420
vast majority of citizens in America, it seems to be serving this very small

802
00:50:11,460 --> 00:50:16,180
elite group who is like this puppeteer pulling the strings.

803
00:50:16,180 --> 00:50:19,660
And we're sitting here like, nobody really wants to go to war.

804
00:50:19,660 --> 00:50:24,660
I haven't really met a single person that was just like gung-ho about going to

805
00:50:24,660 --> 00:50:29,660
war and it doesn't seem like we're getting much out of it.

806
00:50:30,620 --> 00:50:34,940
And, but we're sending all these resources to other countries to keep this going.

807
00:50:35,820 --> 00:50:41,340
Yet, when a tragedy happens in America, like in Hawaii, the citizens in Hawaii

808
00:50:41,340 --> 00:50:46,060
are kind of left needing help and, you know, they're American citizens.

809
00:50:46,060 --> 00:50:46,740
Where's their help?

810
00:50:47,500 --> 00:50:50,620
Well, it's not really in the interest of these puppeteers.

811
00:50:51,180 --> 00:50:54,620
So, you know, they don't really get much from helping the Hawaiian citizen.

812
00:50:56,100 --> 00:50:56,700
Absolutely.

813
00:50:57,460 --> 00:51:01,180
And I think this is where the self-governance aspect has really fallen

814
00:51:01,180 --> 00:51:02,380
apart in society.

815
00:51:02,380 --> 00:51:06,820
Like, if we have to wonder, you know, what exactly is wrong with everything

816
00:51:06,820 --> 00:51:11,060
that's going on, it's the fall of self-governance.

817
00:51:11,060 --> 00:51:17,940
Because laws and even constitutions, they don't actually implement anything.

818
00:51:17,940 --> 00:51:22,620
You know, they set the tone, but it's an agreement that the individuals

819
00:51:22,620 --> 00:51:24,380
have to maintain it, right?

820
00:51:25,340 --> 00:51:30,540
So, what ends up maintaining a good society is culture.

821
00:51:31,180 --> 00:51:34,300
And what ends up maintaining a good culture is self-governance.

822
00:51:34,660 --> 00:51:37,460
And how much an individual is willing to do the right thing.

823
00:51:37,980 --> 00:51:40,100
And so the culture reinforces that.

824
00:51:40,100 --> 00:51:42,300
And then the individual reinforces the culture.

825
00:51:42,860 --> 00:51:49,660
And this is, you know, the common Nietzsche line is that we have killed God, right?

826
00:51:49,660 --> 00:51:54,540
And, and he predicted all the things that were to come that have happened

827
00:51:54,540 --> 00:51:55,740
in the 20th century.

828
00:51:56,460 --> 00:52:00,260
And I think that's where we're really languishing as a society is that we

829
00:52:00,260 --> 00:52:02,580
don't know what to do with ourselves post-God.

830
00:52:03,260 --> 00:52:09,500
And we're seeing, we're very, we're very quick to reject the idea of God.

831
00:52:10,340 --> 00:52:16,220
And, and say, oh, that's such an antiquated idea of some man in the sky,

832
00:52:16,260 --> 00:52:18,700
kind of like cartoonish perspective on God.

833
00:52:19,180 --> 00:52:23,380
But once we've destroyed him, we've actually replaced him with ourselves.

834
00:52:23,820 --> 00:52:27,740
And that's a terrible, on a, on a human level, that's actually terrible for us.

835
00:52:28,100 --> 00:52:32,980
We, we should not think of ourselves on an individual level as the most sort

836
00:52:32,980 --> 00:52:41,580
of the highest being to kind of abide by that what you do alone when no one is

837
00:52:41,580 --> 00:52:46,100
looking, your, your selfish mind will say, that's fine.

838
00:52:46,100 --> 00:52:47,220
You can do whatever you want.

839
00:52:47,580 --> 00:52:50,940
If you have a relationship with a higher power, you would say, no,

840
00:52:50,940 --> 00:52:52,420
what's the right thing to do?

841
00:52:52,900 --> 00:52:55,460
And that conversation is completely lost.

842
00:52:55,860 --> 00:53:01,900
And so people, people kind of, people have become more and more just out

843
00:53:01,900 --> 00:53:02,820
for themselves.

844
00:53:03,300 --> 00:53:07,540
It's like, I can do whatever I can, even if, you know, even if you look at a

845
00:53:07,540 --> 00:53:13,820
very un-successful CEO of a massive company, you know, who's getting fired for

846
00:53:13,820 --> 00:53:17,260
a job because his, his company is, you know, laying off people and doing

847
00:53:17,260 --> 00:53:23,260
really poorly and yet his, his, um, you know, exit package includes a 50

848
00:53:23,260 --> 00:53:25,660
million dollar bonus, right?

849
00:53:26,140 --> 00:53:31,940
There should not be a law that says, Hey, unsuccessful CEOs should not be paid.

850
00:53:32,700 --> 00:53:39,420
But on an individual level, if you're a moral person who says, what about, what

851
00:53:39,420 --> 00:53:44,220
about this is right for me to take money for a job poorly done?

852
00:53:44,940 --> 00:53:49,020
You know, and, and there's no, that sort of that cultural reinforcement nor

853
00:53:49,020 --> 00:53:54,540
individual reinforcement of doing right by society.

854
00:53:55,100 --> 00:53:56,540
And that's where we're at right now.

855
00:53:56,540 --> 00:53:59,820
So that's why, so, and then other people look at it and say, well, if other

856
00:53:59,820 --> 00:54:02,300
people are going to live for themselves, I'm going to live for myself.

857
00:54:02,780 --> 00:54:06,300
So everybody's just sort of bumping into each other, living for themselves,

858
00:54:06,500 --> 00:54:07,860
trying to screw each other over.

859
00:54:08,580 --> 00:54:13,940
So, so we don't really know what to sort of who to answer to what to do.

860
00:54:14,140 --> 00:54:16,100
And everybody's like, just get out of my way.

861
00:54:16,100 --> 00:54:17,540
It's like individual first.

862
00:54:18,780 --> 00:54:20,820
I don't know if I did the best job at explaining that, but.

863
00:54:20,900 --> 00:54:22,380
No, you did an amazing job there.

864
00:54:22,380 --> 00:54:26,260
You made me, I'm really glad you brought up that quote from Nietzsche because I've

865
00:54:26,260 --> 00:54:27,740
been looking into him a lot lately.

866
00:54:28,100 --> 00:54:31,700
And I think that's so relevant when you look at what's happening in, in these

867
00:54:31,700 --> 00:54:37,020
like big urban cities where there's a complete lack of common belief system.

868
00:54:37,420 --> 00:54:38,620
They've killed God.

869
00:54:39,540 --> 00:54:42,100
And so there's nothing holding the people together.

870
00:54:42,980 --> 00:54:47,580
And we like to think that we've got science now and we're really enlightened.

871
00:54:47,580 --> 00:54:52,140
And we, you know, science has given us all this convenience and comfort, but

872
00:54:52,140 --> 00:54:54,380
you can't get your morals from science.

873
00:54:54,620 --> 00:54:57,140
You cannot get your principles from just dry facts.

874
00:54:58,140 --> 00:55:01,060
And I think that's what religion does.

875
00:55:01,060 --> 00:55:02,900
You know, there's good and bad with everything.

876
00:55:02,900 --> 00:55:08,940
But one thing that religion does is it tells you a code of morals to live by.

877
00:55:10,180 --> 00:55:15,860
And so when somebody falls in front of you and gets hurt, uh, you know,

878
00:55:15,900 --> 00:55:19,340
a religious text would say you get down and you help that person.

879
00:55:20,180 --> 00:55:21,780
So you know when that happens to do that.

880
00:55:21,820 --> 00:55:25,700
But if you don't have that core belief system, somebody falls down in front of

881
00:55:25,700 --> 00:55:28,620
you, you can kind of just look at them and say, Oh, that's not my problem.

882
00:55:28,780 --> 00:55:31,420
You know, there, if I help them, what would happen to me?

883
00:55:32,380 --> 00:55:38,940
You know, like it reminds me of, uh, the good Samaritan idea and being a good neighbor.

884
00:55:40,460 --> 00:55:48,860
And, um, yeah, I look around cities now and I see a lot of godless behavior, a lot

885
00:55:48,860 --> 00:55:53,540
of lack of morals, people are not, people don't say hello to each other.

886
00:55:53,540 --> 00:55:58,380
There's a lot of disconnection and you see it manifest in like people live

887
00:55:58,380 --> 00:56:01,980
impulsively, they go towards addiction and prostitution.

888
00:56:01,980 --> 00:56:10,020
And then on the other side, you go to a, a temple or a very old ancient religious

889
00:56:10,100 --> 00:56:15,620
site and there's pristine gardens and it's quiet and it's been preserved for

890
00:56:15,620 --> 00:56:16,500
thousands of years.

891
00:56:16,500 --> 00:56:19,860
And you think, okay, maybe there's something to this.

892
00:56:20,140 --> 00:56:25,140
And there's a philosophical concept called a Chester's tins fence, Chester tins

893
00:56:25,140 --> 00:56:25,540
fence.

894
00:56:26,380 --> 00:56:27,060
Have you heard of this?

895
00:56:27,540 --> 00:56:28,020
I have.

896
00:56:28,580 --> 00:56:28,860
Yeah.

897
00:56:28,860 --> 00:56:29,900
Well, just really quick.

898
00:56:29,900 --> 00:56:34,020
It's, it's like you come up on a fence and you don't know why it's there.

899
00:56:34,540 --> 00:56:38,260
You shouldn't destroy that fence until you know it's purpose.

900
00:56:38,980 --> 00:56:40,460
And that's kind of what religion is.

901
00:56:40,460 --> 00:56:43,420
Like we're, we're coming up to religion and we're saying, oh, let's just destroy it.

902
00:56:44,180 --> 00:56:47,660
But we don't really know what its purpose is fully.

903
00:56:48,180 --> 00:56:50,020
And it's been around for thousands of years.

904
00:56:50,740 --> 00:56:53,900
And it's, we need to be careful if we're just going to toss it out.

905
00:56:54,500 --> 00:56:59,340
I heard a quote, it's, there are two types of fools, those who take religion

906
00:56:59,340 --> 00:57:01,820
literally and those who believe it has no value.

907
00:57:03,580 --> 00:57:09,780
So I kind of, that, that quote really resonated cause I think you have to have

908
00:57:09,780 --> 00:57:11,660
your foot in both realms.

909
00:57:13,300 --> 00:57:13,580
Yes.

910
00:57:13,580 --> 00:57:22,540
Because on either side, there's a very dogmatic belief, you know, and I'm going to

911
00:57:22,540 --> 00:57:27,980
say something, I'm sure it's going to upset a lot of people, but, um, you know,

912
00:57:28,900 --> 00:57:35,100
with the decline of religion could have been so massively avoided to specifically

913
00:57:35,100 --> 00:57:40,020
Christianity in America, if Christians and Christian leaders were more willing

914
00:57:40,020 --> 00:57:46,180
to accept, uh, people in, in, you know, in the gay and lesbian community and say

915
00:57:46,180 --> 00:57:50,260
to them, okay, this is, you know, sort of how you, you were born, you were born.

916
00:57:50,980 --> 00:57:55,980
And instead of rejecting you and calling you immoral and telling you, you know,

917
00:57:55,980 --> 00:58:01,860
you're going to burn in hell, which is to say, no, you know, come into the

918
00:58:01,860 --> 00:58:09,260
community, be who you are, but live morally, settle down with a person, adopt

919
00:58:09,260 --> 00:58:16,580
a child or, you know, have a child by, by some other, you know, person, but live

920
00:58:16,580 --> 00:58:18,500
morally and live a nice fulfilling life.

921
00:58:18,660 --> 00:58:19,900
Come, come be a Christian.

922
00:58:19,900 --> 00:58:24,260
Here's your path to being Christian, you know, and, and I know a lot of people

923
00:58:24,260 --> 00:58:27,740
that makes a lot of Christians unhappy, that idea, because they say, well, the

924
00:58:27,740 --> 00:58:29,100
Bible says this X, Y, and Z.

925
00:58:29,420 --> 00:58:31,780
There are a lot of things by both the Bible says that people don't want to

926
00:58:31,780 --> 00:58:35,100
live by people kind of, it's like what you're saying is like, you take it to

927
00:58:35,100 --> 00:58:36,140
literally, right?

928
00:58:36,380 --> 00:58:38,300
It's like the Bible also has its own limitations.

929
00:58:38,300 --> 00:58:39,620
It was written at certain times.

930
00:58:39,940 --> 00:58:44,700
And so there should be a willingness to understand when something is, is out of

931
00:58:44,700 --> 00:58:48,660
fashion, but can be evolved to meet modern requirements.

932
00:58:48,660 --> 00:58:54,220
And what happened instead, so they rejected this, this huge community and

933
00:58:54,220 --> 00:58:59,540
told them that you are, no matter what your immoral, no matter what, and

934
00:58:59,540 --> 00:59:02,900
completely turned them away, ostracized them completely.

935
00:59:03,900 --> 00:59:09,580
And so they said, okay, well, if I'm immoral anyway, why should I live a

936
00:59:09,580 --> 00:59:10,260
normal life?

937
00:59:11,060 --> 00:59:14,020
You know, why should I try to engage with any of your rules?

938
00:59:15,060 --> 00:59:18,340
And they completely, they were completely cast out into the wild.

939
00:59:18,900 --> 00:59:22,380
And I think that's so damaging for society, because we, at some point, we

940
00:59:22,380 --> 00:59:25,580
had to reconcile with that fact is that some people are gay, some people are

941
00:59:25,580 --> 00:59:27,340
lesbian, you have to reconcile with that fact.

942
00:59:28,220 --> 00:59:32,020
And, and that's the thing is that religion should, should endeavor to be at

943
00:59:32,020 --> 00:59:37,020
the best version of people rather than this overly solidified aspect.

944
00:59:37,020 --> 00:59:40,420
And same with, you know, I'm, I'm not Christian, I'm, I'm Hindu.

945
00:59:40,660 --> 00:59:41,780
It's the same with Hinduism too.

946
00:59:41,780 --> 00:59:45,580
Hinduism, you know, has made many attempts to reject a lot of things.

947
00:59:45,580 --> 00:59:47,540
And, oh, women should do this.

948
00:59:47,540 --> 00:59:50,700
And women should jump in the pyre of their dying husband.

949
00:59:50,740 --> 00:59:53,860
You know, there, there are a lot of limiting things that religion do.

950
00:59:53,860 --> 00:59:54,980
They have to evolve.

951
00:59:55,620 --> 01:00:00,100
And I think that's where we're kind of stuck is like the, you know, like

952
01:00:00,140 --> 01:00:05,460
all these old fashioned ideas that have persisted for thousands of years.

953
01:00:05,500 --> 01:00:06,940
You know, why is marriage good?

954
01:00:06,940 --> 01:00:11,180
All of these things, they're being upended today because everybody's like

955
01:00:11,260 --> 01:00:12,620
willing to question everything.

956
01:00:13,340 --> 01:00:14,700
Let's question everything.

957
01:00:15,380 --> 01:00:18,140
And the problem is that a lot of people don't know how to defend it.

958
01:00:18,660 --> 01:00:22,180
If, you know, it's like kind of like, if a child keeps asking you, why, why, why,

959
01:00:22,180 --> 01:00:24,380
why, why, why this, why that, why do I have to eat this?

960
01:00:24,380 --> 01:00:25,260
Why do I have to do that?

961
01:00:25,500 --> 01:00:27,740
And then the parent just goes eventually because I said so.

962
01:00:28,300 --> 01:00:31,740
You know, and, and that's sort of what society was trying to do is like, well,

963
01:00:31,740 --> 01:00:33,380
you, why, why should I get married?

964
01:00:34,220 --> 01:00:34,980
Everybody does it.

965
01:00:35,260 --> 01:00:35,820
Just do it.

966
01:00:36,700 --> 01:00:42,180
And so that those, I think we became too, we came, we, at a point that we're

967
01:00:42,180 --> 01:00:43,300
willing to question everything.

968
01:00:43,300 --> 01:00:44,740
We needed better answers.

969
01:00:45,700 --> 01:00:50,820
And I think that's what your channel and, you know, hopefully my channel, we're

970
01:00:50,820 --> 01:00:55,620
trying to do is we're trying to answer these questions of, of sort of the old

971
01:00:55,620 --> 01:01:00,340
fashioned values, what value do they have to the individual today?

972
01:01:00,340 --> 01:01:06,580
Because they persisted not because it's some nefarious plot to control the individual.

973
01:01:06,580 --> 01:01:11,540
They persisted because they're actually good for the individual and understanding

974
01:01:11,540 --> 01:01:14,140
that so that people can understand why is marriage so good?

975
01:01:14,140 --> 01:01:15,620
Why is monogamy so good?

976
01:01:16,020 --> 01:01:20,900
You know, there's that, that whole idea of, no, you know, human beings are meant

977
01:01:20,900 --> 01:01:25,660
to be meant, meant to be, uh, you know, polygamous and that selling monogamy,

978
01:01:25,660 --> 01:01:29,860
that's a very Judeo-Christian old fashioned way of controlling people, you

979
01:01:29,860 --> 01:01:31,180
know, that whole thing.

980
01:01:31,540 --> 01:01:35,220
And when that's not true at all, monogamy is actually so good for individuals

981
01:01:35,220 --> 01:01:36,940
and it's so good for children.

982
01:01:37,580 --> 01:01:43,020
And, and so understanding all of that and explaining all of that is, I think

983
01:01:43,020 --> 01:01:50,380
that's the way we move forward is, um, is a non, is without relying on, well,

984
01:01:50,380 --> 01:01:51,780
because God said so.

985
01:01:52,540 --> 01:01:53,540
That's why you have to do it.

986
01:01:53,620 --> 01:01:59,460
Instead, actually giving a thoughtful action with a thoughtful answer without

987
01:01:59,460 --> 01:02:05,220
having to kind of jump it up to the big man in the sky, uh, as, as, as to rely

988
01:02:05,220 --> 01:02:06,220
on his authority.

989
01:02:07,860 --> 01:02:10,060
Yeah, that's, that was beautifully put.

990
01:02:10,260 --> 01:02:17,620
And I've come around to see that monogamy is the best long-term strategy by

991
01:02:17,620 --> 01:02:22,660
far for raising families, for long-term happiness, for living life.

992
01:02:22,700 --> 01:02:25,780
And it's the simplest, for sure.

993
01:02:28,300 --> 01:02:32,460
But I can see when you're young, it's hard to see that because you want to

994
01:02:32,460 --> 01:02:33,460
experience everything.

995
01:02:34,340 --> 01:02:40,380
And you, you know, it's like if you're a prisoner in a cell, I'm like literally

996
01:02:40,380 --> 01:02:45,340
drawing this image right now, there's a prisoner in a cell and he can reach

997
01:02:45,340 --> 01:02:52,380
for the keys to open the cell or he can reach for some food and get some food.

998
01:02:53,180 --> 01:02:56,260
And, you know, the prisoners usually going to reach for the food.

999
01:02:56,700 --> 01:03:00,340
Well, the image shows him reaching for the food because it's like we want to

1000
01:03:00,340 --> 01:03:04,060
reach for that, that instant gratification, that pleasure rather than

1001
01:03:04,900 --> 01:03:06,620
seeing, okay, what's good for the long-term.

1002
01:03:07,900 --> 01:03:08,260
Yeah.

1003
01:03:08,900 --> 01:03:11,260
Yeah, you're so, that's, you're absolutely right.

1004
01:03:11,540 --> 01:03:15,020
And I think as when you're young, you know, you're impetuous enough, but that's

1005
01:03:15,020 --> 01:03:17,180
also important to kind of explore.

1006
01:03:18,020 --> 01:03:20,180
Um, you don't know what you want.

1007
01:03:20,180 --> 01:03:21,900
You're not crystallized yet.

1008
01:03:22,220 --> 01:03:27,340
It's good to have a good dating history to try to see like, you know, what kind

1009
01:03:27,340 --> 01:03:28,740
of person's going to gel with you.

1010
01:03:28,740 --> 01:03:33,460
I, I'm very, uh, opposed to the idea of people getting married super young.

1011
01:03:33,460 --> 01:03:34,900
I'm very opposed to that idea.

1012
01:03:34,900 --> 01:03:38,420
I know that's, uh, a lot of people feel like that's the, the good approach

1013
01:03:38,420 --> 01:03:39,820
to marriage longevity.

1014
01:03:39,820 --> 01:03:45,060
I think, I think instead in those cases, you can sometimes hit the jackpot and

1015
01:03:45,060 --> 01:03:48,380
other times, you know, you were kind of 45 and you wake up and you, you know,

1016
01:03:48,380 --> 01:03:51,420
have to upend your whole life to say, I have to get out of this relationship.

1017
01:03:51,780 --> 01:03:53,620
Which is very destructive, you know, divorce.

1018
01:03:53,620 --> 01:03:57,340
I think honestly, hell and divorce are pretty close together.

1019
01:03:57,460 --> 01:03:59,820
The ideas of those two, two experiences.

1020
01:04:00,340 --> 01:04:05,580
And I think it's good to experience and then at some point to say, okay, now

1021
01:04:05,580 --> 01:04:09,540
to move forward and kind of evolve into who I'm going to be for the, for the

1022
01:04:09,540 --> 01:04:12,020
long haul is to, is to settle down with the person.

1023
01:04:13,940 --> 01:04:14,740
Yeah, I agree.

1024
01:04:14,940 --> 01:04:21,500
All said, um, yeah, there's a couple of other things I wanted to talk to you about.

1025
01:04:22,060 --> 01:04:27,300
I think now would be a good time to talk about what is healthy masculinity.

1026
01:04:27,460 --> 01:04:29,380
And how the femininity look like.

1027
01:04:31,020 --> 01:04:33,060
You said femininity without struggling.

1028
01:04:33,100 --> 01:04:34,260
I always struggle with that.

1029
01:04:34,860 --> 01:04:35,980
That's like femininity.

1030
01:04:36,780 --> 01:04:36,980
Yeah.

1031
01:04:36,980 --> 01:04:38,900
I think I even wrote it with just like, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1032
01:04:40,860 --> 01:04:41,700
Just endless.

1033
01:04:42,580 --> 01:04:42,940
Yeah.

1034
01:04:43,660 --> 01:04:49,220
Um, yeah, I, uh, I think so this is what's really interesting, right?

1035
01:04:49,220 --> 01:04:54,860
Because, um, with the way people think today, it's that if you, if you give a

1036
01:04:54,860 --> 01:04:58,940
proper definition to something people are like well they'll think about the

1037
01:04:58,940 --> 01:05:03,700
exceptions to that right so I want to talk about this one on a general level

1038
01:05:03,700 --> 01:05:07,140
because it's like that's one thing that's gone out of style is pointing out

1039
01:05:07,140 --> 01:05:11,060
that what are men like and what are women like it's like well some men can be

1040
01:05:11,060 --> 01:05:15,220
like that and some women it can be like that it's like yeah with eight billion

1041
01:05:15,220 --> 01:05:19,060
people there are always exceptions to everything but there's a general ideas of

1042
01:05:19,060 --> 01:05:24,260
and there are a lot of similarities between most men and a lot of similarities

1043
01:05:24,260 --> 01:05:28,940
between most women but there are always exceptions I think positive feminine

1044
01:05:28,940 --> 01:05:37,660
positive masculinity to me means a person that is is oriented towards

1045
01:05:37,660 --> 01:05:44,780
protection you know who's strong you know because men are are born to be

1046
01:05:44,780 --> 01:05:49,620
strong to be physically strong and I think psychologically for men engaging

1047
01:05:49,620 --> 01:05:55,100
with physical strength is actually really good for them and and I think that

1048
01:05:55,100 --> 01:06:00,620
trend of modern life that doesn't really reward physical strength is not it's

1049
01:06:00,620 --> 01:06:06,660
not it that's not a good thing for men I and I think encouraging men to be strong

1050
01:06:06,660 --> 01:06:15,220
but also dangerous and capable of being dangerous but then knowing how to be

1051
01:06:15,220 --> 01:06:22,180
gentle like that right balance of of dangerous and gentle which is why you

1052
01:06:22,180 --> 01:06:28,060
know martial arts is such an interesting endeavor for men is because they

1053
01:06:28,060 --> 01:06:31,540
learned that discipline of how to be really really strong but how to apply

1054
01:06:31,540 --> 01:06:38,340
that that strength in the right frame of mind and part of that I think is is

1055
01:06:38,340 --> 01:06:43,500
stoicism which is so I feel like it's such a misunderstood idea because people

1056
01:06:43,540 --> 01:06:50,540
often look at stoicism like saying oh if you're stoic you reject all emotion you

1057
01:06:50,540 --> 01:06:54,780
know you you suppress all of your emotion you don't feel anything you don't

1058
01:06:54,780 --> 01:06:59,780
have space to feel and I think that's completely wrong the the tenant sorry

1059
01:06:59,780 --> 01:07:05,460
about the sound the motorcycle sound but the tenant tenants of stoicism is to

1060
01:07:05,460 --> 01:07:10,500
say one of those is what you and I were talking about earlier that you can't

1061
01:07:10,500 --> 01:07:14,180
control what's going to happen to you you can't control what the world is

1062
01:07:14,180 --> 01:07:17,940
going to be like what you can control is how you react to it and whether or not

1063
01:07:17,940 --> 01:07:24,780
you allow your circumstances to destabilize your mind and so the

1064
01:07:24,780 --> 01:07:32,260
antithesis to stoicism is someone walking into a bar and the barman calls

1065
01:07:32,420 --> 01:07:40,620
you ma'am but you identify as as not a ma'am and you get angry and you start

1066
01:07:40,620 --> 01:07:44,420
throwing a fit and then you go online and start crying and and making a video

1067
01:07:44,420 --> 01:07:48,940
complaining about how much that hurt to hear that that's the antithesis of

1068
01:07:48,940 --> 01:07:55,820
stoicism and you have allowed someone else's actions to make you deeply and

1069
01:07:55,820 --> 01:08:01,460
happy and completely completely upend you and that's the point is that stoicism

1070
01:08:01,460 --> 01:08:05,380
says that are you the master of your emotions or the are the emotions the

1071
01:08:05,380 --> 01:08:09,820
master of you and I think that's a really important part of what it means to be

1072
01:08:09,820 --> 01:08:16,220
a man because men often have to do go out and do sort of the harder physically

1073
01:08:16,220 --> 01:08:22,260
harder things so a mastery of your emotions is really important versus let's

1074
01:08:22,260 --> 01:08:27,740
say for a woman which you know people might take take offense at that but the

1075
01:08:27,740 --> 01:08:32,460
reason it's so important with men is because men wield more dangerous physical

1076
01:08:32,460 --> 01:08:38,180
power so balance of mind is really important if a man loses his cool he can

1077
01:08:38,180 --> 01:08:42,660
cause a lot of damage to the people around him whereas a woman might just

1078
01:08:42,660 --> 01:08:46,820
say things right but a man could actually like really hurt some people

1079
01:08:46,820 --> 01:08:51,420
around him and so that's why I think the stoicism aspect is so important to

1080
01:08:51,500 --> 01:08:58,940
masculinity and that his orientation his like focus is about protecting that

1081
01:08:58,940 --> 01:09:02,980
should be about protecting the people around him whether that's his you know

1082
01:09:02,980 --> 01:09:08,540
wife and mother and and father and daughter and son and that's what's

1083
01:09:08,540 --> 01:09:12,140
really interesting one of the things I was looking into was the statistics up

1084
01:09:12,140 --> 01:09:19,020
around fatherlessness and there's so much negative impact of the fatherlessness

1085
01:09:19,020 --> 01:09:23,820
issue in our society but one of the one of the really shocking ones was that a

1086
01:09:23,820 --> 01:09:28,700
daughter in a fatherless home is nine hundred percent more likely to be

1087
01:09:28,700 --> 01:09:34,740
assaulted and and you know my my friend and I were talking about some some

1088
01:09:34,740 --> 01:09:38,660
random stuff we were talking and one of the things she pointed out she was like

1089
01:09:38,660 --> 01:09:43,060
you know when we were looking at all these Epstein things all these flight

1090
01:09:43,060 --> 01:09:46,700
logs and all this stuff going on she said her father said the first thing

1091
01:09:46,980 --> 01:09:53,380
her father said was where are the fathers of all those daughters like why are

1092
01:09:53,380 --> 01:09:57,420
those daughters you know all those little young girls why are they in those

1093
01:09:57,420 --> 01:10:03,100
situations and that's the thing is like you need a strong man to protect young

1094
01:10:03,100 --> 01:10:10,100
girls from other nefarious men you need a strong man paying attention to that so

1095
01:10:10,100 --> 01:10:15,980
I think that whole aspect of protection and children who come from homes where

1096
01:10:15,980 --> 01:10:25,460
they feel protected is so crucial and I think for young men having a man model

1097
01:10:25,460 --> 01:10:30,900
for them the importance of positive masculinity is so important because for

1098
01:10:30,900 --> 01:10:36,860
young men they don't learn from moms just like young girls don't learn

1099
01:10:36,860 --> 01:10:41,900
femininity from dads you know you need it to be modeled for you to understand

1100
01:10:41,940 --> 01:10:45,620
and so that's why then you know it's important to have a coach or a teacher

1101
01:10:45,620 --> 01:10:49,620
or someone some male influence positive male influence to tell you what's right

1102
01:10:49,620 --> 01:10:55,820
but also to keep you in check young boys you know test the boundaries of life and

1103
01:10:55,820 --> 01:10:59,540
they need someone that can challenge them a mother can't challenge them after

1104
01:10:59,540 --> 01:11:04,100
a certain age but a father can forever if he's if he's taking his

1105
01:11:04,100 --> 01:11:08,780
responsibility seriously and tell and that's one that was a really good point

1106
01:11:08,780 --> 01:11:12,420
that Larry Elder had made when he went on the breakfast breakfast club a couple

1107
01:11:12,420 --> 01:11:15,860
months ago he said you know I was never scared of the police what the police might

1108
01:11:15,860 --> 01:11:19,820
do to me I was scared of what my father would do to me if I if I misbehaved and

1109
01:11:19,820 --> 01:11:23,700
when you see the amount of youth out there you know you were mentioning kind

1110
01:11:23,700 --> 01:11:27,940
of the city streets issues you see a lot of youth out there that's not afraid of

1111
01:11:27,940 --> 01:11:31,780
the police they're not afraid of anybody and it's because the first person

1112
01:11:31,780 --> 01:11:35,180
they need to be afraid of was their father as the primary discipline

1113
01:11:35,860 --> 01:11:41,500
so I think all of those aspects are really important about that go into

1114
01:11:41,500 --> 01:11:45,660
masculinity that end up actually really holding society together that are really

1115
01:11:45,660 --> 01:11:51,900
crucial and then should I move on to femininity or do you want to pause here

1116
01:11:51,900 --> 01:11:58,980
that was really beautifully said and it's the masculinity issue is it has so

1117
01:11:58,980 --> 01:12:05,980
many sides to it yes and and you were saying that a lot of men find used to

1118
01:12:05,980 --> 01:12:09,860
find their place in the world through physical means you know they pride

1119
01:12:09,860 --> 01:12:15,900
themselves on being physically strong and for thousands of years that brought

1120
01:12:15,900 --> 01:12:19,700
you a lot of value into the world or that that was your way of adding value to

1121
01:12:19,700 --> 01:12:23,940
the world was your strength and now we're living in this modern world where

1122
01:12:24,420 --> 01:12:30,180
your physical strength and endurance and just like your your masculine power isn't

1123
01:12:30,180 --> 01:12:34,660
isn't quite as useful and so I think a lot of people are turning to like things

1124
01:12:34,660 --> 01:12:39,420
like martial arts as an outlet for that but still it's not like you're going to

1125
01:12:39,420 --> 01:12:44,740
be on the front lines doing jujitsu to defend your country right it's it's a

1126
01:12:44,740 --> 01:12:52,260
simulation of of an ancient art but there are less and less jobs that require

1127
01:12:52,340 --> 01:13:00,740
that masculine physical strength so I think that an important transition for

1128
01:13:00,740 --> 01:13:09,300
men is to be there as spiritual protectors now yes yes it's it's just as

1129
01:13:09,300 --> 01:13:15,420
important as physical protection and yeah if you abandon your children they're

1130
01:13:15,420 --> 01:13:20,020
not going to have that spiritual protection or encouragement or guidance

1131
01:13:20,020 --> 01:13:25,300
and yeah it it makes sense some some of those statistics that you just said

1132
01:13:25,300 --> 01:13:29,780
that yeah without that spiritual protection you could end up in some

1133
01:13:29,780 --> 01:13:34,220
bad situations it's a sad situation especially in San Francisco when you

1134
01:13:34,220 --> 01:13:40,980
walk down any street and you see these people who are engaged in drug abuse

1135
01:13:41,540 --> 01:13:47,140
and they're keeled over and I look at them sometimes and I feel like I mean I

1136
01:13:47,140 --> 01:13:51,420
know this might make it sound like I'm trivializing the situation but I often

1137
01:13:51,420 --> 01:13:55,540
think in movies I like make connections to certain scenes and like the

1138
01:13:55,540 --> 01:13:59,900
emotional resonance of things kind of help stabilize accordingly to me but I

1139
01:13:59,900 --> 01:14:04,900
thought of them and thought about Gollum and how you know one of the things he

1140
01:14:04,900 --> 01:14:11,020
says is that I forgot the feel of of the wind I forgot the taste of food I

1141
01:14:11,020 --> 01:14:15,860
forgot my own name and that's what it seems like to me is that they're

1142
01:14:15,860 --> 01:14:21,420
forgotten that they're human beings and they're willing to actually let

1143
01:14:21,420 --> 01:14:30,700
themselves be in this very sort of disjointed you know non-human state and

1144
01:14:31,380 --> 01:14:37,500
a lot of that comes from feelings of abandonment of you know the statistics

1145
01:14:37,500 --> 01:14:44,540
around again youths that end up you know engaged in drug abuse and running away

1146
01:14:44,540 --> 01:14:51,180
from home and becoming homeless are pretty heavily tied to fatherless homes

1147
01:14:51,180 --> 01:14:57,820
pretty heavily it's like 90% of youths that are on the street are are come from

1148
01:14:58,180 --> 01:15:04,540
fatherless homes and the thing is that your mother can't abandon you a mother

1149
01:15:04,540 --> 01:15:09,460
might that's very rare because mothers have the biological attachment we have

1150
01:15:09,460 --> 01:15:14,540
the benefit of that first of all child is like literally part of your body and

1151
01:15:14,540 --> 01:15:20,620
but there are also a lot of hormones and things that engage in bonding that are

1152
01:15:20,620 --> 01:15:25,860
very very strong so it's it's almost like a given that a mother is going to be

1153
01:15:25,860 --> 01:15:30,300
there till the day you die you know well that's a weird way to say it when you

1154
01:15:30,300 --> 01:15:33,840
mothers rarely see their children die what am I saying I understand what you're

1155
01:15:33,840 --> 01:15:39,500
saying you understand what I'm saying I'm losing my mind clearly mothers are

1156
01:15:39,500 --> 01:15:45,060
there through the long haul like you said but a father has a choice whether or

1157
01:15:45,060 --> 01:15:50,220
not to engage with his children and he can choose to walk away and when a father

1158
01:15:50,220 --> 01:15:55,620
chooses to walk away it actually creates such a fracture for children a

1159
01:15:55,620 --> 01:16:00,660
feeling of abandonment a feeling that they weren't good enough and that's a

1160
01:16:00,660 --> 01:16:04,340
such a common thing by the way if you see you know in any TV show there's so

1161
01:16:04,340 --> 01:16:09,420
many instances of characters that the father wasn't in the picture and they

1162
01:16:09,420 --> 01:16:14,180
have all these abandonment issues as a result you know Barney from how I met

1163
01:16:14,180 --> 01:16:18,340
your mother is an example of that you know Schmidt from New Girl is an example

1164
01:16:18,380 --> 01:16:21,860
of that it means very common and Barney when he comes across his father and

1165
01:16:21,860 --> 01:16:27,180
finds out that he actually has this family now and has a kid who he named

1166
01:16:27,180 --> 01:16:32,260
after himself you know he Barney feels so he feels so terrible he was like why

1167
01:16:32,260 --> 01:16:38,020
was wasn't I enough for you to do that for you to be there for me and so this

1168
01:16:38,020 --> 01:16:42,300
whole idea that you know it's totally fine if a child is raised by single

1169
01:16:42,300 --> 01:16:44,980
mothers and the reason people say that is because they don't want to hurt the

1170
01:16:44,980 --> 01:16:48,220
feelings of single mothers they're doing a very hard job but it's actually

1171
01:16:48,220 --> 01:16:53,740
so massive it's such a massive problem and and then you see them then on the

1172
01:16:53,740 --> 01:16:59,860
streets and you can understand why one of the you know one half of a very

1173
01:16:59,860 --> 01:17:03,780
important partnership that needed to make them feel like they were good enough

1174
01:17:03,780 --> 01:17:08,260
was missing from their lives and and they didn't know how to they don't know

1175
01:17:08,260 --> 01:17:12,620
how to manage life without that for a lot of people you know that's the that's

1176
01:17:12,740 --> 01:17:19,580
unfortunate occurrence without a father one of my most popular videos is how

1177
01:17:19,580 --> 01:17:26,540
childhood trauma leads to addiction by dr. Gabor mate and yeah essentially his

1178
01:17:26,540 --> 01:17:31,700
his theory boils down to from a young age from the moment we're born

1179
01:17:31,700 --> 01:17:37,140
attachment is our number one need if we don't stay attached to adults will die

1180
01:17:38,060 --> 01:17:44,140
so we hold that over every other value we need to stay attached to adults and we

1181
01:17:44,140 --> 01:17:49,300
will suppress our authenticity to stay attached and he says anytime you

1182
01:17:49,300 --> 01:17:54,420
suppress your authenticity is when you create trauma and the more you express

1183
01:17:54,420 --> 01:17:58,820
your authenticity the greater you will chase that feeling of attachment later

1184
01:17:58,820 --> 01:18:04,140
in life and things like heroin I've never done it but apparently it provides

1185
01:18:04,260 --> 01:18:10,460
that exact feeling almost that exact chemical concoction in the brain of

1186
01:18:10,460 --> 01:18:15,780
that attachment feeling so you see some of these addicts living in what looks

1187
01:18:15,780 --> 01:18:22,980
like hell on earth but they inject this drug and for however long they are

1188
01:18:22,980 --> 01:18:26,180
feeling like they're bathed in love they're finally getting that hug from

1189
01:18:26,180 --> 01:18:32,220
their parent that they've been longing for forever so that theory seemed to

1190
01:18:32,620 --> 01:18:39,460
really sad yeah really really sad so yeah you know there's there's two ways

1191
01:18:39,460 --> 01:18:43,100
to look at these people on the street you know a lot a lot of people see them

1192
01:18:43,100 --> 01:18:47,780
as a problem to be solved but yeah you can also look at them as they are just

1193
01:18:47,780 --> 01:18:52,460
the products of this environment that they didn't choose and you know if I

1194
01:18:52,460 --> 01:18:58,540
was in that situation would I be the same maybe you know probably right yeah yeah

1195
01:18:58,580 --> 01:19:03,700
I mean in that way you know you have to really count blessings right that are

1196
01:19:03,700 --> 01:19:08,300
given to us and and that have helped prevent us from falling down that kind

1197
01:19:08,300 --> 01:19:14,260
of path but to say oh I would never do that right you know but but to say like

1198
01:19:14,260 --> 01:19:18,380
no there there are situations that you might do that you know or I might do

1199
01:19:18,380 --> 01:19:24,140
that so I feel yeah I feel really sad for those people because it is such a

1200
01:19:24,260 --> 01:19:29,820
misunderstood problem but it's also one that there's no sort of there's no

1201
01:19:29,820 --> 01:19:35,660
adequate push to resolve at the moment unfortunately absolutely there's a

1202
01:19:35,660 --> 01:19:41,820
YouTube channel called Channel 5 with Andrew Callahan I think and he just did

1203
01:19:41,820 --> 01:19:48,620
a really good documentary about San Francisco and all the car break-ins I

1204
01:19:48,620 --> 01:19:53,780
used to live there my car got broken into six times I lived there so this

1205
01:19:54,380 --> 01:19:58,820
particular did they break the tiny window or did they do other things just

1206
01:19:58,820 --> 01:20:03,020
curious they pretty much broke every window okay including the front windshield

1207
01:20:03,020 --> 01:20:10,940
at one point so yeah it's very thorough experience them all so when I saw this

1208
01:20:10,940 --> 01:20:14,860
topic I clicked on the video with a lot of emotion like yeah we got to get rid

1209
01:20:14,860 --> 01:20:20,740
of these these people they're like parasites that are going around causing

1210
01:20:20,860 --> 01:20:26,940
chaos with no ramifications they need to be stopped and he did such a great job

1211
01:20:26,940 --> 01:20:30,780
reporting he finally meets one of these guys that breaks into the cars and he

1212
01:20:30,780 --> 01:20:35,260
follows him around for an entire day and gets to know him really well and by the

1213
01:20:35,260 --> 01:20:39,380
end I'm feeling really bad for this guy like he has a kid that he hasn't seen

1214
01:20:39,380 --> 01:20:43,620
and he wants to see him and he's he's got no options he's hooked on these

1215
01:20:43,620 --> 01:20:49,820
fentanyl and he's been abandoned kind of kind of like the typical tragic story

1216
01:20:50,100 --> 01:20:56,140
and by the end you're like my god like I could have been this guy if I was in

1217
01:20:56,140 --> 01:21:02,860
that situation you know you can't it's hard to judge at that point hmm wow okay

1218
01:21:02,860 --> 01:21:08,740
I definitely need to watch that because you know I I can have empathy and then

1219
01:21:08,740 --> 01:21:12,940
there are moments of frustration where I kind of find myself completely outside

1220
01:21:12,940 --> 01:21:19,700
of that and very angry and I think I need to recalibrate a little bit you

1221
01:21:19,700 --> 01:21:27,580
know yeah there's an idea that we don't have any free will that I don't fully

1222
01:21:27,580 --> 01:21:32,580
agree with but it there's a lot of logic to it that you know we are products of

1223
01:21:32,580 --> 01:21:36,420
our environment yeah all these variables go into everything is cause and effect

1224
01:21:36,420 --> 01:21:41,060
right and I think the value in in seeing that argument though is that you don't

1225
01:21:41,060 --> 01:21:46,420
hold blame on people as much as you would if you didn't know that idea because

1226
01:21:46,700 --> 01:21:53,060
when you see somebody committed atrocity you can kind of see alright at one

1227
01:21:53,060 --> 01:21:57,500
at one point this person was a baby and they just got fumbled around in the

1228
01:21:57,500 --> 01:22:02,300
wrong way and you you don't you don't hold that resentment in your heart

1229
01:22:02,300 --> 01:22:07,660
towards them yeah if you know that idea yeah of course there are lines that you

1230
01:22:07,660 --> 01:22:10,900
have to set and there are boundaries that have to be drawn so you can't just be

1231
01:22:10,900 --> 01:22:15,980
indifferent on everything right but I think it's helpful to have that idea in

1232
01:22:15,980 --> 01:22:20,140
your mind as well yeah you you know that completely makes sense because it's not

1233
01:22:20,140 --> 01:22:24,980
like they got they have no free will but there is and they need to have some

1234
01:22:24,980 --> 01:22:30,220
level of positive influence to at least help them see what's a good path for

1235
01:22:30,220 --> 01:22:33,820
them of how they can create a better life but if they never get that

1236
01:22:33,820 --> 01:22:37,900
opportunity how could they see it's not like we're born with any kind of

1237
01:22:37,900 --> 01:22:44,420
inherent understanding of good we we have we have some level of where we can

1238
01:22:44,420 --> 01:22:48,900
engage oh this is a good thing to do and this is not but it takes a lot of

1239
01:22:48,900 --> 01:22:54,740
thought and and sort of exploration to get to that it's not kind of built in

1240
01:22:54,740 --> 01:22:59,700
absolutely yeah well I guess we should probably round this segment out with the

1241
01:22:59,700 --> 01:23:09,340
feminine femininity side yes so let's do it positive femininity look like so I

1242
01:23:09,500 --> 01:23:14,580
think femininity is not about physical strength that's not to say that some

1243
01:23:14,580 --> 01:23:18,380
women aren't physically strong and if that's what they are interested in I

1244
01:23:18,380 --> 01:23:26,740
think femininity is about a different sort of emotional and mental strength it

1245
01:23:26,740 --> 01:23:39,100
takes a lot to first of all walk around as as a sort of a weaker weaker part of

1246
01:23:39,100 --> 01:23:47,660
society in a lot of ways if I'm just going about my day I have to make sure

1247
01:23:47,660 --> 01:23:52,820
I'm thinking about where I might be putting myself at risk and I have I

1248
01:23:52,820 --> 01:23:56,100
have responsibility to myself and my loved ones to make sure that I don't

1249
01:23:56,140 --> 01:24:00,740
put myself in situations where I'm at risk and in those cases it's it is this

1250
01:24:00,740 --> 01:24:09,300
weird relationship that every woman has with men where a man at on an empty

1251
01:24:09,300 --> 01:24:13,580
street dark street could be your perpetrator or your savior it could be

1252
01:24:13,580 --> 01:24:17,740
either you know you don't know you might either be really happy to see him or

1253
01:24:17,740 --> 01:24:24,820
really sad to see him and I think that one of those important aspects of being

1254
01:24:25,060 --> 01:24:29,540
a woman is to be very responsible and I mean and this is one of those things

1255
01:24:29,540 --> 01:24:33,740
that women modern women really hate this idea but there's a reason why women

1256
01:24:33,740 --> 01:24:40,620
mature faster is because we first of all puberty for women it means we are

1257
01:24:40,620 --> 01:24:45,660
inundated with a lot of negative emotion which I recall that moment and

1258
01:24:45,660 --> 01:24:51,340
suddenly I went from being a very happy child to very sad all the time and you

1259
01:24:51,340 --> 01:24:56,420
know we had our we have our initiation into womanhood that men don't have you

1260
01:24:56,420 --> 01:25:01,060
know we we know when we're suddenly women we have we actually have a very

1261
01:25:01,060 --> 01:25:07,780
strong bookend for that or sorry like I guess not a bookend but transition for

1262
01:25:07,780 --> 01:25:13,980
that and that means suddenly you're looked at differently you have to behave

1263
01:25:13,980 --> 01:25:17,420
differently you have to you have to be a lot more thoughtful and how you're

1264
01:25:17,420 --> 01:25:24,940
presenting yourself to the world and I think part of that is also then how you

1265
01:25:24,940 --> 01:25:30,860
engage with men and how you allow men to look at you this is something I feel

1266
01:25:30,860 --> 01:25:37,140
very strongly about but I think about it's very important for positive

1267
01:25:37,140 --> 01:25:42,900
femininity to be about imposing lines on with how like boundaries around how

1268
01:25:42,900 --> 01:25:51,260
men engage with you and and converse with you relate with you and you know

1269
01:25:51,260 --> 01:25:53,940
this was something that when I was growing up it was a good thing I'd

1270
01:25:53,940 --> 01:25:59,380
grown up on books like Pride and Prejudice and you know Emily Bronte's

1271
01:25:59,380 --> 01:26:03,420
books like I had I grew up on kind of very old-fashioned perspectives on on

1272
01:26:03,420 --> 01:26:08,460
the feminine and when I got to college and every man thought that it was

1273
01:26:08,460 --> 01:26:14,940
perfectly acceptable to get my affection or my time by just sending me a

1274
01:26:14,940 --> 01:26:25,380
you-up text was so angering that that's what passed as as modern romance and I

1275
01:26:25,380 --> 01:26:31,340
found it so deeply offensive that that it was perfectly acceptable that a man

1276
01:26:31,340 --> 01:26:36,340
could look at me like a commodity that he could get at the end of the night just

1277
01:26:36,340 --> 01:26:39,620
by sent you know either buying me a drink or sending me something like that

1278
01:26:39,620 --> 01:26:49,100
and I think forget about what anybody thinks on an individual level as a woman

1279
01:26:49,100 --> 01:26:54,580
you will live a much better life if you have a strong control on how people how

1280
01:26:54,580 --> 01:27:01,580
people how much people sexualize and commodify you and you know and this is

1281
01:27:01,580 --> 01:27:05,380
something I could talk about honestly endlessly but the the the biggest

1282
01:27:05,380 --> 01:27:11,860
difference the biggest impact is kind of how how if if you set a boundary on how

1283
01:27:11,860 --> 01:27:16,180
other people treat you you also end up really ensuring that you you treat

1284
01:27:16,180 --> 01:27:21,820
yourself properly that you respect yourself it's really easy again coming

1285
01:27:21,820 --> 01:27:26,300
back to that like people kind of rushing to whatever is easy today it's a

1286
01:27:26,300 --> 01:27:31,560
really easy for me to monetize myself on my body I could start an only fans to

1287
01:27:31,560 --> 01:27:35,200
tomorrow I have a YouTube channel I could tell them hey I'm starting an only

1288
01:27:35,200 --> 01:27:40,280
fans and I could be making money I mean I'm like whatever looking whatever but I

1289
01:27:40,280 --> 01:27:44,040
could do that because it's really easy for a woman to make money by commodifying

1290
01:27:44,040 --> 01:27:48,600
herself but does that mean that you're gonna be endlessly happy is that in

1291
01:27:48,600 --> 01:27:52,440
respect yourself and have healthy relationships with opposite sex or your

1292
01:27:52,440 --> 01:27:56,400
children or your parents absolutely not it's because you are telling someone

1293
01:27:56,400 --> 01:28:00,080
else that they can buy your body and that's how that's how the world is gonna

1294
01:28:00,080 --> 01:28:07,040
treat you they're gonna treat your body like a commodity so I think that sort of

1295
01:28:07,040 --> 01:28:12,160
conservative approach to how you let the world talk to you is really really

1296
01:28:12,160 --> 01:28:18,240
healthy for on an individual level for a woman and then the other aspect of it is

1297
01:28:18,240 --> 01:28:23,560
like what's your responsibility to the opposite sex let's say your husband or

1298
01:28:23,560 --> 01:28:27,040
your part you know your your male partner specifically we're talking about men

1299
01:28:27,040 --> 01:28:34,080
and women here I think men unfortunately don't have a lot of opportunity to have

1300
01:28:34,080 --> 01:28:39,800
an outlet for their emotion I think partly societal and partly I think it's

1301
01:28:39,800 --> 01:28:49,800
just how men sort of prefer to be and I think being that sort of sort of creating

1302
01:28:49,800 --> 01:28:56,640
that space for your husband or your boyfriend or whoever to have an outlet

1303
01:28:56,640 --> 01:29:02,600
and talk to you and share with you sort of all of their insecurities and fears

1304
01:29:02,600 --> 01:29:07,480
and and giving them that opportunity to do so without having ramifications or

1305
01:29:07,480 --> 01:29:11,320
like you know reputation issues or punishing them is really important

1306
01:29:11,320 --> 01:29:15,040
because we women are really good at that and this is something I didn't really

1307
01:29:15,040 --> 01:29:19,920
realize until until I was married so I you know I'm I have a brother but I

1308
01:29:19,920 --> 01:29:25,440
honestly didn't understand this until I got married was that you know my husband

1309
01:29:25,440 --> 01:29:30,200
talks to his father about his issues or he talks to me but that's but that's it

1310
01:29:30,200 --> 01:29:36,440
I talked to my husband I talked to my dad I talked to my mom I talked to my

1311
01:29:36,440 --> 01:29:39,920
brother I talked to my sister-in-law I talked to my friend I for talked to my

1312
01:29:39,920 --> 01:29:44,240
other friend I talked to my other friend I have endless sources of places where I

1313
01:29:44,240 --> 01:29:47,560
actually have an outlet for my emotions and my issues and all of that and

1314
01:29:47,560 --> 01:29:52,440
everybody you know receives it and says go go ahead you cry you feel it all of

1315
01:29:52,440 --> 01:29:56,160
that and I noticed that with my husband he he doesn't have a lot of those like

1316
01:29:56,160 --> 01:30:00,800
he's not he's not even willing to do that but it's like he actually doesn't

1317
01:30:00,800 --> 01:30:05,840
have adequate outlets for that and that's one one of those aspects I think is

1318
01:30:05,840 --> 01:30:09,560
really important is that if men are going to be those like spiritual

1319
01:30:09,560 --> 01:30:12,760
protectors like you were talking about and I love that idea that concept of

1320
01:30:12,760 --> 01:30:17,520
spiritual protective it's so important that they also need to have a place where

1321
01:30:17,520 --> 01:30:24,120
they can be weak and have an outlet for that emotion and I think that's really

1322
01:30:24,120 --> 01:30:30,040
important for women to do that and you know modern women hate it being told

1323
01:30:30,040 --> 01:30:34,160
like we need to do this for our husbands like it's like that's like you know

1324
01:30:34,160 --> 01:30:39,320
this absolutely loads some idea to say to a woman these days but just like men

1325
01:30:39,320 --> 01:30:44,960
oh women things and for us to say oh husband should endeavor to do this for

1326
01:30:44,960 --> 01:30:47,720
his wife that's a good thing we say oh that's a good thing yes husbands should

1327
01:30:47,720 --> 01:30:51,360
do things for their wives but that's the same thing is that you know we women

1328
01:30:51,360 --> 01:30:56,080
have responsibilities as well and I think our emotional intelligence is our

1329
01:30:56,080 --> 01:31:00,480
greatest strength our ability to to comfort to care for I mean that we

1330
01:31:00,480 --> 01:31:04,520
should not we should not reject those ideas that's that's our greatest strength

1331
01:31:04,520 --> 01:31:11,320
the whole the whole foundation of family is built on a woman that's willing to

1332
01:31:11,320 --> 01:31:18,240
build a good family but the protection and safety and ultimate success of the

1333
01:31:18,240 --> 01:31:22,800
family is based on a husband and his willingness to protect his family and I

1334
01:31:22,800 --> 01:31:29,720
think in that way is where you partner up and create this really strong connection

1335
01:31:29,720 --> 01:31:37,880
between the best of both sexes for you know ultimate success I was beautifully

1336
01:31:37,920 --> 01:31:44,680
put you keep giving me a lot to think about and I'm taking notes here I did a

1337
01:31:44,680 --> 01:31:51,760
video this summer to try to clarify sex and gender it was a big video and I

1338
01:31:51,760 --> 01:31:58,000
knew it would be risky to make but we I worked with Heather Hying and Brett

1339
01:31:58,000 --> 01:32:03,680
Weinstein oh what what I mean what a great partnership there so they look at

1340
01:32:03,680 --> 01:32:09,480
this entire issue from a evolutionary biology lens and it was really

1341
01:32:09,480 --> 01:32:14,000
interesting to just look at it through that lens but when you take it down to

1342
01:32:14,000 --> 01:32:20,560
like the sperm and the egg you have thousands and thousands of sperm

1343
01:32:20,560 --> 01:32:25,600
competing competing for that one egg and that translates to our behavior in the

1344
01:32:25,600 --> 01:32:29,960
real world men typically are more focused on what happens before

1345
01:32:30,120 --> 01:32:34,520
reproduction whereas women are more focused on what happens after reproduction

1346
01:32:34,520 --> 01:32:39,400
because they have to take care of the child whereas men so you typically see

1347
01:32:39,400 --> 01:32:45,360
men competing a lot more and they're fighting with with each other for a

1348
01:32:45,360 --> 01:32:52,320
mate and it is the woman's job to be a filter and to be selective and I think

1349
01:32:52,320 --> 01:32:57,800
that manifests in what we value in men and women like we it's really seen as

1350
01:32:57,840 --> 01:33:04,440
valuable for a man to be able to provide because that sets him competitively that

1351
01:33:04,440 --> 01:33:09,080
sets him out from the herd and it also shows that he could be an asset after

1352
01:33:09,080 --> 01:33:14,800
the child is born he can create a stable environment for that child down the

1353
01:33:14,800 --> 01:33:24,240
road whereas what men value in women is fertility but also a big thing that you

1354
01:33:24,240 --> 01:33:29,800
were speaking on that often gets overlooked is the ability to be selective

1355
01:33:29,800 --> 01:33:36,440
the ability to be that filter which is the ability to set boundaries and say

1356
01:33:36,440 --> 01:33:43,680
no and so if a woman shows that she's able to say no her value goes way up in

1357
01:33:43,680 --> 01:33:51,080
the eyes of men and yes that that only fans life is very alluring it's right

1358
01:33:51,120 --> 01:33:57,320
there it's that instant gratification and it's it can be hard to say no to it but

1359
01:33:57,320 --> 01:34:04,640
the second you do that you completely lose that filter that value and you can

1360
01:34:04,640 --> 01:34:10,040
never get it back yeah which is something you know feminism is trying to

1361
01:34:10,040 --> 01:34:14,480
change that so fourth wave feminism I think we're evolving past fourth wave and

1362
01:34:14,480 --> 01:34:19,120
into fifth wave I don't know when they'll make that declaration but I think

1363
01:34:19,120 --> 01:34:24,840
you know fourth wave was all about sort of DV a DEI and and actual like I think

1364
01:34:24,840 --> 01:34:31,360
at fourth wave they've achieved a lot of success by actually infiltrating HR

1365
01:34:31,360 --> 01:34:36,840
departments and writer rooms and they you know that they've gotten some level

1366
01:34:36,840 --> 01:34:41,480
of critical critical mass but fifth wave if we could make that argument that

1367
01:34:41,480 --> 01:34:48,440
we're entering that is might I lose my train of thought fifth wave like a fifth

1368
01:34:48,440 --> 01:34:54,520
wave do we even have women anymore or is that concept just become relative yeah

1369
01:34:54,520 --> 01:35:00,360
no that I think so the whole breakdown of the definition of woman really happened

1370
01:35:00,360 --> 01:35:06,560
at the third wave but we didn't hear about it until the fourth wave because

1371
01:35:06,560 --> 01:35:12,040
the the whole third wave was based on intersectionality as well as this book

1372
01:35:12,040 --> 01:35:17,040
that Judith Butler I always find it hard to say her name but Judith Butler who is

1373
01:35:17,040 --> 01:35:21,480
it who is a professor at UC Berkeley wrote this book called gender trouble

1374
01:35:21,480 --> 01:35:28,680
where she sort of brought to popularity the concept of gender roles you know

1375
01:35:28,680 --> 01:35:33,200
being something that you could jump between sorry gender and sex being

1376
01:35:33,200 --> 01:35:38,480
something you could jump between that it could and you know she hers she

1377
01:35:38,480 --> 01:35:44,320
identified as non-binary so prefers to go by a day so it really got

1378
01:35:44,320 --> 01:35:48,000
introduced then but what was the thing you said sorry what was the last thing

1379
01:35:48,000 --> 01:35:53,040
you had said right before was it about fifth wave and how we're just gonna get

1380
01:35:53,040 --> 01:35:56,400
so relative that we're gonna lose the definitions of everything but right

1381
01:35:56,400 --> 01:36:01,080
before that what was like the point I was talking about women are the filter

1382
01:36:01,360 --> 01:36:06,880
oh and only fans yes okay so now I cut it sorry that fifth wave is gonna is

1383
01:36:06,880 --> 01:36:12,720
really gonna be about finalizing this concept that sex work is just regular

1384
01:36:12,720 --> 01:36:20,040
work and that commodifying of the of the body is totally fine and I think part

1385
01:36:20,040 --> 01:36:26,160
of that is already in motion there's a lot of push for the destigmatization of

1386
01:36:26,240 --> 01:36:31,480
adult industry work because women are the ones you know they say that suffer

1387
01:36:31,480 --> 01:36:35,480
the consequences for that for good reasons as you've explained and I

1388
01:36:35,480 --> 01:36:39,560
completely agree with all of those which is that it's you know a filtration

1389
01:36:39,560 --> 01:36:45,480
system for a woman is far more important than for a man and that's the big push

1390
01:36:45,480 --> 01:36:50,400
that women are suffering for having to engage with the adult industry because

1391
01:36:50,400 --> 01:36:55,880
you know due to limited economic issue you know resources that a woman might

1392
01:36:55,880 --> 01:36:59,440
turn to something like only fans and then she's ostracized for the rest of her

1393
01:36:59,440 --> 01:37:04,160
life and that should not be allowed why is it that men are not and and when men

1394
01:37:04,160 --> 01:37:08,640
are the main consumers of something like that why is that not why is that not

1395
01:37:08,640 --> 01:37:13,320
forgiven for women or even not even considered for women and the other thing

1396
01:37:13,320 --> 01:37:22,240
that's going to happen is going to be the overhauling of woman you know that

1397
01:37:22,240 --> 01:37:27,080
idea of woman bearing children I think that's going to be the next push is

1398
01:37:27,080 --> 01:37:31,320
going to be that oh well we should just be relying on science to bear children

1399
01:37:31,320 --> 01:37:37,320
and that even a surrogate is totally fine that's going to be the next push

1400
01:37:37,320 --> 01:37:43,440
policy-wise which in America is a lot more lenient but in other countries it's

1401
01:37:43,440 --> 01:37:48,360
considered a pretty pretty difficult thing to accept because what you're doing

1402
01:37:48,360 --> 01:37:53,160
through surrogacy and this is something Louise Perry talks a lot about that she

1403
01:37:53,160 --> 01:37:56,840
talks about how you know you're intentionally breaking a very important

1404
01:37:56,840 --> 01:38:00,720
bond between mother and child and I'm sure Gabor Maté would have a lot to say

1405
01:38:00,720 --> 01:38:05,040
about that as well because you know that that there's a lot of trauma attached to

1406
01:38:05,080 --> 01:38:12,360
that because you know the baby the first heartbeat that he or she hears is the

1407
01:38:12,360 --> 01:38:15,800
mother's heartbeat the smell I mean the baby doesn't even for the first couple

1408
01:38:15,800 --> 01:38:19,760
for a long time doesn't even feel like they're apart from the mother right even

1409
01:38:19,760 --> 01:38:23,000
after being born they feel like the mother's body is their body it's like a

1410
01:38:23,000 --> 01:38:27,360
very deep connection that you intentionally break through surrogacy so

1411
01:38:27,360 --> 01:38:33,000
I think there's a lot of moral questions that people are going to try to raise

1412
01:38:33,040 --> 01:38:37,200
that you know the next wave of feminism is going to say no well you know it's

1413
01:38:37,200 --> 01:38:42,200
totally fine to farm out someone some other woman's body for for my

1414
01:38:42,200 --> 01:38:45,720
particular needs or your particular needs that should be totally okay and

1415
01:38:45,720 --> 01:38:49,080
consider a regular transaction and that's that's really what is we're

1416
01:38:49,080 --> 01:38:53,720
looking at is that general commodification of the female body and

1417
01:38:53,720 --> 01:39:00,840
and and that being totally okay well yeah if we're gonna take it to the future

1418
01:39:00,880 --> 01:39:06,680
trajectory yeah I think we're not that far away from AI porn and things like

1419
01:39:06,680 --> 01:39:16,160
that so yeah it'll yeah the the the competition may be with these AI porn

1420
01:39:16,160 --> 01:39:20,560
bots and that's gonna be hard to compete with because those things are gonna

1421
01:39:20,560 --> 01:39:26,000
have no taboos but those things will be able to go to the wildest fantasy and

1422
01:39:26,000 --> 01:39:32,120
beyond yeah and I don't think any human would be able to compete with that so

1423
01:39:32,120 --> 01:39:37,560
perhaps we're gonna go so full cycle we're gonna go all the way around or you

1424
01:39:37,560 --> 01:39:41,840
know every sex work is gonna be incentivized and then it's gonna be just

1425
01:39:41,840 --> 01:39:46,080
like we can't compete with these AI bots let's just go back to having like

1426
01:39:46,080 --> 01:39:54,500
peaceful civil romance yeah I'm being optimistic maybe it'll just get so

1427
01:39:54,540 --> 01:40:00,780
chaotic that I'm done with this I'm getting off this train yeah I I actually

1428
01:40:00,780 --> 01:40:04,900
think that I don't think we're headed in into a dark future I think things are

1429
01:40:04,900 --> 01:40:09,860
really dark now and are likely to be for a little bit but I don't think our

1430
01:40:09,860 --> 01:40:18,580
future is dark I think I think we're in a very difficult transition period where

1431
01:40:18,620 --> 01:40:25,180
we've lost that like I was saying that that man in the sky to tell us what to

1432
01:40:25,180 --> 01:40:30,700
do and we've overextended individual freedom so much that we feel completely

1433
01:40:30,700 --> 01:40:36,420
spiritually lost and now I think it's going to be about bringing things back

1434
01:40:36,420 --> 01:40:42,660
together hopefully but without reliance on on because God said so but instead

1435
01:40:42,660 --> 01:40:47,700
because this is what's good for everybody I think we're gonna build a new

1436
01:40:47,740 --> 01:40:51,300
morality system is what I think is going to happen because it's kind of

1437
01:40:51,300 --> 01:40:57,620
already happening you know the idea that porn is bad for you if if you said

1438
01:40:57,620 --> 01:41:02,540
that five years ago or ten years ago people would be like shut up who cares

1439
01:41:02,540 --> 01:41:09,940
you know no it's not and now that actually that idea is is taking hold

1440
01:41:09,940 --> 01:41:14,980
people are understanding why porn is so bad for you and many people are

1441
01:41:15,020 --> 01:41:19,220
choosing to stay away from it completely stay away from it same with

1442
01:41:19,220 --> 01:41:26,380
alcohol same with birth control you know birth control is just considered this

1443
01:41:26,380 --> 01:41:31,540
magic thing and now there's so much awareness being spread that birth

1444
01:41:31,540 --> 01:41:36,340
control is actually devastating to your hormones and that you should

1445
01:41:36,340 --> 01:41:40,940
absolutely get away from it and many people are resentful that their doctors

1446
01:41:40,940 --> 01:41:44,740
their primary care physicians didn't warn them about the side effects that

1447
01:41:44,820 --> 01:41:48,500
they could expect because a lot of people women felt suicidal on it emotional on

1448
01:41:48,500 --> 01:41:54,220
it still do and and then the impact on it later is is after once once you get

1449
01:41:54,220 --> 01:41:59,020
off of it is also pretty pretty big but again people like Andrew Huberman you

1450
01:41:59,020 --> 01:42:05,020
know is shedding a lot of light on stuff like that so I think we're and and even

1451
01:42:05,020 --> 01:42:08,460
fatherlessness now that's like a big conversation that we're having right I

1452
01:42:09,020 --> 01:42:16,820
think it's all sort of gone from research to entering the the general

1453
01:42:16,820 --> 01:42:22,340
conversation and now it's just going to spread from here and there's this whole

1454
01:42:22,340 --> 01:42:30,340
slice of society that's so intent upon making themselves as great as possible

1455
01:42:30,340 --> 01:42:34,100
and I think they watch your channels like yours they watch channels like Chris

1456
01:42:34,180 --> 01:42:40,660
Williamson like and Andrew Huberman Brett Weinstein and Jordan Peterson and

1457
01:42:40,660 --> 01:42:47,780
they they are intent upon building a good life for themselves that's you know

1458
01:42:47,780 --> 01:42:52,700
without caffeine or like full of workouts and and you know thinking about their

1459
01:42:52,700 --> 01:42:57,700
problems and not you know suppressing them it's like all these great things and

1460
01:42:57,700 --> 01:43:01,740
then also understanding their moral code or understanding the value of

1461
01:43:01,740 --> 01:43:07,180
religion I mean how many people watched Jordan Peterson's lecture on on Genesis

1462
01:43:07,180 --> 01:43:13,220
and then his seminar on on Exodus I mean people are engaging that without being

1463
01:43:13,220 --> 01:43:17,420
religious themselves and they're seeing that kind of like the Chesterton's

1464
01:43:17,420 --> 01:43:21,540
fence thing is that you know religion has its values you don't have to turn

1465
01:43:21,540 --> 01:43:29,020
into a dogmatic you know person who's going and looking down at everybody for

1466
01:43:29,420 --> 01:43:32,900
believing certain not believe not believing certain ideas which is what

1467
01:43:32,900 --> 01:43:37,620
religion really turned into for a lot of people is that it became this tool for

1468
01:43:37,620 --> 01:43:40,620
their ego and to beat down on other people and tell them they're going to

1469
01:43:40,620 --> 01:43:47,260
hell but no religion has individual value that's so that's so wonderful and I

1470
01:43:47,260 --> 01:43:50,500
think it's all about taking the ego out of it and I think that's going to be the

1471
01:43:50,500 --> 01:43:53,940
new form of morality that's going to burgeon up it's going to be an

1472
01:43:53,940 --> 01:43:59,500
intellectual morality and and and so I I'm very hopeful that a lot of things

1473
01:43:59,500 --> 01:44:05,780
are going to turn around that's that's brilliant yeah I love what you just said

1474
01:44:05,780 --> 01:44:11,260
and I think we've now had enough time to see the second order effects of a lot of

1475
01:44:11,260 --> 01:44:14,780
things that we thought were like the solutions to be all and all solutions and

1476
01:44:14,780 --> 01:44:20,460
now we're saying okay 20 years later what's the second order effects of all

1477
01:44:20,460 --> 01:44:24,020
these antidepressants we've given everybody yeah what's the second order

1478
01:44:24,020 --> 01:44:30,580
effects of all the ADHD medication we've given out birth control you know we're

1479
01:44:30,580 --> 01:44:34,980
now starting to see oh wow there you know you there's nothing no such thing as a

1480
01:44:34,980 --> 01:44:40,980
free lunch we know there's there's an impact there's unintended consequences

1481
01:44:40,980 --> 01:44:45,940
to everything so unfortunately we're still doing things right now where we're

1482
01:44:45,940 --> 01:44:51,020
gonna see down the line the second order effects but I think a lot of people

1483
01:44:51,020 --> 01:44:56,140
that are optimistic enough to be parents in this modern world are going to have

1484
01:44:56,140 --> 01:45:00,540
the tools now to teach their kids about second order effects instead of saying

1485
01:45:00,540 --> 01:45:04,780
hey no you can't do that hey don't watch porn no matter what you're not allowed

1486
01:45:04,780 --> 01:45:07,860
to and they say why and you're like I don't know it's bad instead of saying

1487
01:45:07,860 --> 01:45:12,580
that you could lay out a path and say look down the line this is how it affects

1488
01:45:12,580 --> 01:45:18,460
you and this is how it'll derail your entire life so it depends on what you

1489
01:45:18,460 --> 01:45:23,940
want if you want a family and a successful career and to be fit you can't

1490
01:45:23,940 --> 01:45:28,380
get derailed in this way yeah but if your goal is just to be derailed or if

1491
01:45:28,380 --> 01:45:34,660
you don't have a goal then by all means go down these impulsive paths yes but I

1492
01:45:34,660 --> 01:45:39,220
think it's having the ability to lay that out for a next generation is really

1493
01:45:39,220 --> 01:45:45,060
important so that they have like a healthy compass of the world because like

1494
01:45:45,060 --> 01:45:49,780
in Genesis the first one of the first stories it is human nature to want to

1495
01:45:49,780 --> 01:45:53,540
do what we're not allowed to that's like the first thing humans want to do God

1496
01:45:53,540 --> 01:45:57,220
puts Adam and Eve on earth and says don't eat that fruit first thing they're

1497
01:45:57,220 --> 01:46:01,460
gonna do is eat it so right you know maybe if he explained what happens if you

1498
01:46:01,460 --> 01:46:06,180
eat it they would have chosen differently yeah yeah and my husband or I

1499
01:46:06,260 --> 01:46:10,700
talking about that because he recently gave up alcohol I say recently but it's

1500
01:46:10,700 --> 01:46:14,420
been more than a year and it's funny because every time he tells people that

1501
01:46:14,420 --> 01:46:19,860
he gave up alcohol people say well were you an alcoholic you know it's like

1502
01:46:19,860 --> 01:46:23,740
they assume that you had this major problem and that's why you had to give

1503
01:46:23,740 --> 01:46:29,420
it up when he just realized like I just didn't feel good with it and and one of

1504
01:46:29,420 --> 01:46:32,700
the things he was thinking about is like oh when we have kids at least I feel

1505
01:46:32,700 --> 01:46:38,420
more now emboldened and empowered with with information to say why you should

1506
01:46:38,420 --> 01:46:42,620
not drink alcohol or have a healthy relationship with it at least but that

1507
01:46:42,620 --> 01:46:46,860
when he was growing up it was just like because I said so and same with me and

1508
01:46:46,860 --> 01:46:52,140
the ideas around modesty I grew up in a very modest household I grew up you know

1509
01:46:52,140 --> 01:46:57,300
and I took to it I wasn't really rebellious about it I actually felt

1510
01:46:57,300 --> 01:47:04,020
like it actually felt kind of natural to me to be modest and but as I grew up it

1511
01:47:04,020 --> 01:47:07,300
started to make sense to me and I of course tested a lot of the theories out

1512
01:47:07,300 --> 01:47:13,020
when I was in college because I did want to have my rebellious time but I had to

1513
01:47:13,020 --> 01:47:18,060
like stumble into the understanding of why me treating my body as something

1514
01:47:18,060 --> 01:47:21,660
that was sacred was important for my mental health and for me to actually

1515
01:47:21,660 --> 01:47:25,020
have a very successful relationship then in the future with whoever I ended up

1516
01:47:25,020 --> 01:47:30,060
with forever is that then he also knew that I had treated my body as very

1517
01:47:30,060 --> 01:47:38,180
sacred and wasn't so it was it took time to understand that and now and and now

1518
01:47:38,180 --> 01:47:42,380
you know you have writers like Louis Louis Perry explaining the ideas of why

1519
01:47:42,380 --> 01:47:47,100
modesty is so important or you know you shouldn't get drunk around you know

1520
01:47:47,100 --> 01:47:50,580
these in these like frat parties of because of what kind of impact that

1521
01:47:50,580 --> 01:47:56,060
might have on you and she does it all without lending to religion at all and

1522
01:47:56,060 --> 01:48:02,060
and if she had you know I don't think it's wrong to rely on religion but I

1523
01:48:02,060 --> 01:48:06,900
think people feel like religion is an incomplete answer to them and so it's

1524
01:48:06,900 --> 01:48:10,620
like she's instead explaining like the full path of it and bringing it back to

1525
01:48:10,620 --> 01:48:14,580
the individuals like what exactly happens you know if you if you engage in

1526
01:48:14,580 --> 01:48:18,980
in one path versus another I think we're just getting those like very detailed

1527
01:48:18,980 --> 01:48:23,980
answers to things yeah we're very lucky right now where we're living in this age

1528
01:48:23,980 --> 01:48:28,820
of we have so much access to information yes I'm so grateful to people like

1529
01:48:28,820 --> 01:48:33,740
Jordan Peterson who are taking all these incredible philosophers and old texts

1530
01:48:33,740 --> 01:48:38,300
and he's filtering it down into such an easy way to understand and same with

1531
01:48:38,300 --> 01:48:43,540
religious texts too yeah it's because of Jordan Peterson that I've looked into

1532
01:48:43,540 --> 01:48:48,540
Carl Jung and Victor Frankel and all these other philosophers that you know

1533
01:48:48,580 --> 01:48:51,460
you hear him mention a name enough times you're like okay I should probably

1534
01:48:51,460 --> 01:48:56,700
check out that book yeah and it's he's really been like well I guess you could

1535
01:48:56,700 --> 01:49:02,300
bring it down to like Joe Rogan Joe Rogan led me to him and then he led me to

1536
01:49:02,300 --> 01:49:07,140
like 20 other great philosophers and I keep going down this rabbit hole now I'm

1537
01:49:07,140 --> 01:49:12,940
like getting into these very obscure ancient occult type things and I'm like

1538
01:49:12,940 --> 01:49:21,660
wow yeah okay is this an okay time for me to tell you about a bit Bushina do you

1539
01:49:21,660 --> 01:49:26,380
want to do you want to talk about that yeah because I think I think it it's a

1540
01:49:26,380 --> 01:49:35,620
good wrap on everything as well so I told you this but I at the end of last

1541
01:49:35,620 --> 01:49:42,820
year went for a 10-day silent retreat it's called the Bushina where you live

1542
01:49:42,860 --> 01:49:48,780
like a monk for 10 days you don't you have certain precepts like morality

1543
01:49:48,780 --> 01:49:52,580
precepts that you have to follow for example you don't engage in misconduct

1544
01:49:52,580 --> 01:49:56,620
you don't lie for those 10 days you're sort of taking this oath you don't kill

1545
01:49:56,620 --> 01:50:00,900
anything so even if there's an insect in your room they have like a little way

1546
01:50:00,900 --> 01:50:03,980
for you to take it out so you don't kill the insects you're eating vegetarian

1547
01:50:03,980 --> 01:50:11,260
food but specifically it's through this organization called it's maybe it's called

1548
01:50:11,300 --> 01:50:21,940
just dhamma d-h-a-m-m-a and it follows it follows the precepts set by Buddhism

1549
01:50:21,940 --> 01:50:27,300
like Buddha specifically from you know centuries ago and Buddha himself

1550
01:50:27,300 --> 01:50:32,620
discovered this practice when he was meditating and he discovered it based on

1551
01:50:32,620 --> 01:50:37,140
ancient Indian texts that were sort of lost so he rediscovered this technique

1552
01:50:37,140 --> 01:50:42,980
and then he crystallized it into this method of 10 days of meditation that

1553
01:50:42,980 --> 01:50:48,060
help you achieve start to achieve sort of an understanding of your path to

1554
01:50:48,060 --> 01:50:55,100
enlightenment and my friend convinced me to do this I was a very very skeptical

1555
01:50:55,100 --> 01:50:59,340
she's been trying to convince me for 10 years but the idea of being in silence

1556
01:50:59,340 --> 01:51:04,820
and without any access to you know my material world felt very frightening to

1557
01:51:04,820 --> 01:51:11,380
me and I'm so glad I went she finally convinced me and I went and the the

1558
01:51:11,380 --> 01:51:15,420
whole idea is that it's actually completely free and they don't even let

1559
01:51:15,420 --> 01:51:22,700
you donate before you take a course so that's actually part of the mechanism

1560
01:51:22,700 --> 01:51:27,740
to get you into the right mindset which is that you are here with all this room

1561
01:51:27,740 --> 01:51:34,460
and board and and food that's being served to you is you're here on the by

1562
01:51:34,460 --> 01:51:38,540
the grace of other people's charity other ex-students have paid for for your

1563
01:51:38,540 --> 01:51:43,980
ability to be here and that alone that's that begins that sort of humility

1564
01:51:43,980 --> 01:51:52,140
practice to help you recognize that you need to then maybe this is a good time

1565
01:51:52,140 --> 01:51:56,980
to sort of rethink your approach to life because you know modern life we're

1566
01:51:56,980 --> 01:52:00,980
relying on ourselves we go out and about like I pay for my lunch you know

1567
01:52:00,980 --> 01:52:05,980
I'm I've been relying on myself for for you know better part of you know 20

1568
01:52:05,980 --> 01:52:10,220
years whatever so to suddenly be there on someone else's charity felt very

1569
01:52:10,220 --> 01:52:13,500
strange but that's how monks and nuns live right and that's what you're

1570
01:52:13,500 --> 01:52:18,780
engaging in you're engaging in the very simple life and you're not allowed to

1571
01:52:18,780 --> 01:52:22,260
talk to anybody you can't look at anybody in the eye everything's kind of

1572
01:52:22,260 --> 01:52:26,660
set up as like a self-service situation and the men and women are completely

1573
01:52:26,780 --> 01:52:30,580
separated so that you're not distractions to each other and then the

1574
01:52:30,580 --> 01:52:34,420
primary thing you're doing is that you're meditating pretty much for most of

1575
01:52:34,420 --> 01:52:38,340
the day it's like 10 hours of meditation a day and you learn a specific

1576
01:52:38,340 --> 01:52:43,060
meditation technique so even though you're not allowed to talk to anybody

1577
01:52:43,060 --> 01:52:48,060
they do have a discourse where the teacher teaches you about the system of

1578
01:52:48,060 --> 01:52:52,260
meditation and why it's important so you're kind of learning the tenets of

1579
01:52:53,020 --> 01:52:58,500
dhamma and it's a non-religious completely you know completely sort of

1580
01:52:58,500 --> 01:53:05,340
secular universal ideas that they talk about and they all they talk about the

1581
01:53:05,340 --> 01:53:12,420
the kind of what is what is the cause of everyone's misery and you know this is

1582
01:53:12,420 --> 01:53:16,180
something Buddhists talk about all the time which is attachment but specifically

1583
01:53:16,180 --> 01:53:20,500
what they talk about is this we're caught in the cycle of craving and a

1584
01:53:20,500 --> 01:53:25,100
versions and this was something that was really important for me because I am

1585
01:53:25,100 --> 01:53:33,060
actually prone to this massive iPhone addiction I mean it was bad and that was

1586
01:53:33,060 --> 01:53:36,180
something I realized that every time through this practice every time I was

1587
01:53:36,180 --> 01:53:41,420
you know writing a video for my for my channel and I would run into something

1588
01:53:41,420 --> 01:53:45,060
difficult some difficult part I didn't know what to write as the next sentence

1589
01:53:45,380 --> 01:53:51,020
immediately pick up the phone right it's because I had an aversion felt terrible

1590
01:53:51,020 --> 01:53:56,100
had a craving to stop the aversion pick up the phone phone is a distraction you

1591
01:53:56,100 --> 01:53:59,580
know and that's sort of how I've been living my life for some time now of

1592
01:53:59,580 --> 01:54:04,380
just using my phone as a distraction and what's amazing about Vipassana is that

1593
01:54:04,380 --> 01:54:09,660
you have nowhere to run you are meditating you're going inward you don't

1594
01:54:09,660 --> 01:54:13,180
have anyone to talk to you you don't have any distractions of modern life like

1595
01:54:13,220 --> 01:54:16,540
your phone like your computer but you don't even have an occupation you don't

1596
01:54:16,540 --> 01:54:21,180
even have a job to keep you mentally busy you just have to reconcile with

1597
01:54:21,180 --> 01:54:29,180
yourself and that whole forced process of that you're just sitting with yourself

1598
01:54:29,180 --> 01:54:35,100
is so interesting it's it's really difficult it's extremely difficult it

1599
01:54:35,100 --> 01:54:39,980
was like way too much time to spend with myself but the learnings out of it are

1600
01:54:40,020 --> 01:54:43,420
so incredible and then what you start to notice through the Vipassana practice of

1601
01:54:43,420 --> 01:54:49,060
the specific type of meditation which I won't get into here but it actually

1602
01:54:49,060 --> 01:54:53,460
starts getting all of your all those things that you've been running from it

1603
01:54:53,460 --> 01:54:58,220
allows it to come out it allows it to surface and it'll surface these are as

1604
01:54:58,220 --> 01:55:04,660
a thought or as a sensation on your body or emotion and they warn they warn you

1605
01:55:04,660 --> 01:55:09,100
that specific days tend to be really difficult for people and fifth day was

1606
01:55:09,100 --> 01:55:12,300
the first day that I noticed that a lot of people were crying around me and I

1607
01:55:12,300 --> 01:55:16,860
was very emotional it's like stuff just it's just there's been enough time that

1608
01:55:16,860 --> 01:55:19,860
you've been sitting in silence that stuff starts to really come out and that's

1609
01:55:19,860 --> 01:55:25,460
what the whole practice is really about is just try to recognize the misery cycle

1610
01:55:25,460 --> 01:55:29,300
that people tend to keep themselves in and how to release themselves from it

1611
01:55:29,300 --> 01:55:35,620
and it was the most transformative experience of my life it's something you

1612
01:55:35,660 --> 01:55:39,780
know I know you're curious about it I would highly highly recommend but that's

1613
01:55:39,780 --> 01:55:43,740
also why I wanted to bring it up here in case this is something that is

1614
01:55:43,740 --> 01:55:48,100
interesting to other people they should definitely check it out because I think

1615
01:55:48,100 --> 01:55:53,580
it's a very easy we live in a world where we can get every one of our sort of

1616
01:55:53,580 --> 01:55:57,140
immediate needs met sort of what you've you've been talking about this you know

1617
01:55:57,140 --> 01:56:01,860
the sketch you were talking about so it's a very hard to meet our it's very

1618
01:56:01,900 --> 01:56:07,340
easy to meet our basic needs it's our spiritual needs that go completely

1619
01:56:07,340 --> 01:56:13,740
ignored and this was a great opportunity to sort of reset my priorities like one

1620
01:56:13,740 --> 01:56:19,140
of the things I noticed is that I I love my family I love my husband I love my

1621
01:56:19,140 --> 01:56:24,900
friends and mentally I was deprioritizing them over my phone that like

1622
01:56:24,900 --> 01:56:28,300
there was a part of me that was irritated if someone was talking to me

1623
01:56:28,300 --> 01:56:31,140
because that meant I wasn't on my phone I mean that's how bad my addiction was

1624
01:56:31,220 --> 01:56:37,260
I mean it's really embarrassing to even say it but this thing completely helped me

1625
01:56:37,260 --> 01:56:44,220
see that and I felt that ache that that's what I was doing in my life and and so

1626
01:56:44,220 --> 01:56:47,620
it helps you sort of reset a lot of things actually understand what your real

1627
01:56:47,620 --> 01:56:56,660
priorities are that sounds amazing wow so that was 10 days 10 days how did it

1628
01:56:56,700 --> 01:57:03,100
seem like 10 days or did it seem longer seem longer definitely seem longer and I

1629
01:57:03,100 --> 01:57:08,180
think the first couple of days like past classially slow because the meditation

1630
01:57:08,180 --> 01:57:11,700
periods you know are really long and then it changes your perception of time

1631
01:57:11,700 --> 01:57:16,380
you know suddenly sitting because you meditate for one hour at a time just

1632
01:57:16,380 --> 01:57:22,700
just about and that first couple of sessions felt so long and then slowly

1633
01:57:22,700 --> 01:57:26,100
you're like oh one hour meditation doesn't sound that bad you know any more

1634
01:57:26,740 --> 01:57:30,660
and and now we keep up the practice you have to you know if you want to continue

1635
01:57:30,660 --> 01:57:34,900
to engage with it it's up to you but you you keep up a daily practice of it as

1636
01:57:34,900 --> 01:57:39,580
well but yeah I did feel it incredibly long and then especially at the end

1637
01:57:39,580 --> 01:57:43,420
because one of the things I just really struggled with was just missing company

1638
01:57:43,420 --> 01:57:49,020
it's like I'm really lonely and so I got to I think by day nine I just started

1639
01:57:49,020 --> 01:57:55,140
started to really like come on we're almost there almost there wow so have

1640
01:57:55,180 --> 01:58:00,340
you had enough time to process the experience like have you changed yes I

1641
01:58:00,340 --> 01:58:06,380
have I think I think there were a lot of ideas if you go let's say I think what

1642
01:58:06,380 --> 01:58:09,980
you might find is that there are a lot of ideas that aren't really new to you

1643
01:58:09,980 --> 01:58:13,220
you've been circling around them you know in your in your intellectual

1644
01:58:13,220 --> 01:58:17,460
endeavors just like as you know that's how I felt because I think they're all

1645
01:58:17,460 --> 01:58:23,060
ideas that that makes sense on a universal level whether it's Thomas's I'm

1646
01:58:23,060 --> 01:58:26,020
telling you about it or Jordan Peterson talking about it or Carl Jung talking

1647
01:58:26,020 --> 01:58:30,140
about it there are a lot of similarities in the in that understanding but there

1648
01:58:30,140 --> 01:58:33,820
was one final piece that felt like it was missing where I was like circling

1649
01:58:33,820 --> 01:58:42,460
around the ideas but that didn't mean that it had internalized quite so as

1650
01:58:42,460 --> 01:58:47,060
part of this this philosophy you know the teachings of Dhamma one of the things

1651
01:58:47,060 --> 01:58:50,740
he talks about is that there are three types of the main teacher his name is

1652
01:58:50,780 --> 01:58:55,820
Goenka who has passed on now but there are recordings of him where he he he just

1653
01:58:55,820 --> 01:59:01,220
gives the lesson and one of the things he talks about is that there are three

1654
01:59:01,220 --> 01:59:07,780
different types of wisdom one is you hear someone else give you a piece of

1655
01:59:07,780 --> 01:59:12,420
wisdom another is that you yourself understand it where you can intellectually

1656
01:59:12,420 --> 01:59:17,420
and completely understand it and relate it to other people but then there's a

1657
01:59:17,420 --> 01:59:23,140
third piece of wisdom where you feel it and he gave the example of of medicine

1658
01:59:23,140 --> 01:59:27,540
that if a doctor tells you oh you're sick you need to take this medicine and you

1659
01:59:27,540 --> 01:59:31,540
say oh that's great doctor thank you for this medicine that's you

1660
01:59:31,540 --> 01:59:35,540
recognizing this other person giving you this piece of wisdom you can go and

1661
01:59:35,540 --> 01:59:40,380
possess the medicine that's you understanding it you go went to the

1662
01:59:40,380 --> 01:59:46,300
pharmacy and filled up your prescription but until you take it it's not going to

1663
01:59:46,300 --> 01:59:51,660
help you and that was the piece that I felt was missing where I you know one

1664
01:59:51,660 --> 01:59:54,980
of the things that's due to the difficulties of the last couple of

1665
01:59:54,980 --> 02:00:00,940
years my it's it's really taken a toll on my body so for what you know for about

1666
02:00:00,940 --> 02:00:06,300
a year ago I just came out of this period where I had a lot had like massive

1667
02:00:06,300 --> 02:00:11,860
hair fall like massive hair fall and I also developed a chronic health issue in

1668
02:00:11,860 --> 02:00:17,020
that in that period so it was like I understood the ideas that people were

1669
02:00:17,020 --> 02:00:23,260
telling me intellectually but I hadn't quite internalized it where it wasn't

1670
02:00:23,260 --> 02:00:28,060
being all these issues and miseries of my life were still being stored in my

1671
02:00:28,060 --> 02:00:31,980
body and we're still taking a toll on me mentally and physically and

1672
02:00:31,980 --> 02:00:39,820
spiritually and this this going to this helped take me to that finish line

1673
02:00:39,860 --> 02:00:44,140
where I'm not saying I'm fixed or anything like that but at least

1674
02:00:44,140 --> 02:00:48,700
understanding the principle of how to help myself and how to engage with

1675
02:00:48,700 --> 02:00:56,460
with with with my issues that was that was extremely extremely necessary that's

1676
02:00:56,460 --> 02:01:04,740
incredible it sounds like an experience I could benefit greatly from I'm you're

1677
02:01:04,740 --> 02:01:11,420
not gonna change too much though right I might become too zen and just float

1678
02:01:11,420 --> 02:01:16,060
out of here do you think this is gonna inform your future content are you

1679
02:01:16,060 --> 02:01:20,420
gonna take it in a different direction yes I think so I think you know one of

1680
02:01:20,420 --> 02:01:25,020
the conversations you and I had had last time like I was telling you the you know

1681
02:01:25,020 --> 02:01:38,300
you've inspired me to be less sort of a tacky about things and more more sort of

1682
02:01:38,300 --> 02:01:43,220
create positive visions for things so I you know you had you had sort of told

1683
02:01:43,220 --> 02:01:46,620
me about how you think about those things and that was something I was kind

1684
02:01:46,620 --> 02:01:51,900
of mulling over in my mind and now I understood why that's so important for

1685
02:01:51,940 --> 02:01:56,820
me to do that so I don't want to be sitting in just bashing things and it's

1686
02:01:56,820 --> 02:02:00,860
okay I think to criticize stuff I don't I don't think there's anything wrong with

1687
02:02:00,860 --> 02:02:04,460
that I think that's a necessary part of any dialogue but to be constantly

1688
02:02:04,460 --> 02:02:08,140
dunking on something is not something that I want to engage with I think that

1689
02:02:08,140 --> 02:02:14,140
that instead trying to spread as much positivity and love as possible is is

1690
02:02:14,140 --> 02:02:20,660
really what what I kind of gleaned from from this experience that's amazing I

1691
02:02:20,660 --> 02:02:26,780
think for the last couple years the level of cynicism has been increasing but I

1692
02:02:26,780 --> 02:02:31,940
feel like it it might get to a breaking point where people are gonna get keen to

1693
02:02:31,940 --> 02:02:37,140
it and say I'm done with this cynicism because even even in our area we're like

1694
02:02:37,140 --> 02:02:42,460
critical drinker he'll make a video about how horrible a movie is and that will

1695
02:02:42,460 --> 02:02:46,140
get three million views and then he'll say hey this movie is pretty good and

1696
02:02:46,140 --> 02:02:50,140
that'll get like a couple hundred thousand views yeah and even myself like

1697
02:02:50,140 --> 02:02:54,860
when I see he's like he says this movie really sucks I'm like oh this is gonna

1698
02:02:54,860 --> 02:02:58,340
be a great review yeah let's hear a critical drinker just dunk on this movie

1699
02:02:58,340 --> 02:03:03,700
yeah but same same that's fine I hope he keeps doing that yeah but because the

1700
02:03:03,700 --> 02:03:08,300
movies do suck they need to get dunked on but yeah someone has to dunk on them

1701
02:03:08,620 --> 02:03:15,100
and he does it so well yeah we need a positive image of the future we need a

1702
02:03:15,100 --> 02:03:21,660
vision that we can that gets us out of bed in the morning and I was I just did a

1703
02:03:21,660 --> 02:03:28,260
podcast about the pyramids in Egypt and one thing that's so special about them

1704
02:03:28,260 --> 02:03:31,940
is they're so mysterious but when you see them you realize that possibilities

1705
02:03:31,940 --> 02:03:36,980
are endless and you're looking at something that is impenetrable to time

1706
02:03:37,740 --> 02:03:42,500
and for one moment you get a glimpse into this thing that is like eternal and

1707
02:03:42,500 --> 02:03:47,300
it makes you feel like you're part of this thing that's eternal and that even

1708
02:03:47,300 --> 02:03:52,100
though your physical body was gonna go away part of your essence can just like

1709
02:03:52,100 --> 02:03:58,820
ripple on forever and when you it's easy when you're in this matrix world where

1710
02:03:58,820 --> 02:04:02,500
everything's so temporary and the buildings are all concrete and glass and

1711
02:04:02,620 --> 02:04:07,300
everything's put together so fast and carelessly you kind of feel like you're

1712
02:04:07,300 --> 02:04:14,900
just a cognitive machine you're just disposable and yeah I feel like the

1713
02:04:14,900 --> 02:04:20,340
importance of getting outside of the matrix into these situations like what

1714
02:04:20,340 --> 02:04:24,540
you just did or seeing the pyramids or just anything that takes you out of

1715
02:04:24,540 --> 02:04:30,100
your normal state of consciousness yeah maybe it's psychedelics who knows can

1716
02:04:30,140 --> 02:04:36,340
show you can can let you touch a different state and see time in a

1717
02:04:36,340 --> 02:04:41,700
different way see yourself in a different way and step outside yourself so yeah

1718
02:04:41,700 --> 02:04:46,340
it's very important to to mix things up otherwise it's like roundhog day same

1719
02:04:46,340 --> 02:04:51,980
thing every day yeah yeah and look you know especially true for SF is that

1720
02:04:51,980 --> 02:04:56,220
it's very easy to distort your own reality and think that this is life this

1721
02:04:56,220 --> 02:04:59,740
is everything that's happening the chaos that's happening on these city streets

1722
02:05:00,380 --> 02:05:06,860
is life and suddenly I found myself in these beautiful woods and it's snowing

1723
02:05:06,860 --> 02:05:12,700
and they're deer about and woodpeckers in the trees and they're you know ducks in

1724
02:05:12,700 --> 02:05:17,820
the pond and I thought wow what you know I'm I'm so wrapped up in a one type of

1725
02:05:17,820 --> 02:05:24,420
existence that I can't I can't even perceive anything else sometimes so it's

1726
02:05:24,420 --> 02:05:29,700
good to just like you said just good to break out of it yeah well I don't think

1727
02:05:29,700 --> 02:05:32,420
your phone addiction is that bad actually because when you were saying

1728
02:05:32,420 --> 02:05:37,700
that I was like oh boy that's I do the same thing sometimes when somebody's

1729
02:05:37,700 --> 02:05:41,260
talking to me while I've got my phone out I'm like alright just want to see

1730
02:05:41,260 --> 02:05:48,820
this one more meme hold on yeah it can get bad yeah I mean it's you know it's

1731
02:05:48,820 --> 02:05:54,020
it's it's designed to keep you hooked you know it's designed to keep you

1732
02:05:54,020 --> 02:06:00,220
swiping forever yeah I mean I just got back from a trip and I had my my phone

1733
02:06:00,220 --> 02:06:04,540
on airplane mode I didn't want to do the roaming and so I my mind was like okay

1734
02:06:04,540 --> 02:06:08,380
you're gonna be back in Wi-Fi pretty soon you're getting closer to Wi-Fi and I

1735
02:06:08,380 --> 02:06:12,300
felt like my mind I'm like can you just enjoy what you're doing now instead of

1736
02:06:12,300 --> 02:06:16,820
worrying about when you're gonna get to that like I felt like a guy that was

1737
02:06:16,820 --> 02:06:20,900
swimming through the ocean trying to get to an island there's Wi-Fi it was

1738
02:06:21,060 --> 02:06:26,620
okay I that so okay so as part of the question I they have you you know hand in

1739
02:06:26,620 --> 02:06:32,020
your phone you can either leave it in your car you leave it in a locker and I

1740
02:06:32,020 --> 02:06:36,060
found myself not missing the phone at all because I'm on the phone even when

1741
02:06:36,060 --> 02:06:41,180
I'm brushing my teeth I mean it's like I said it's bad nothing you're saying is

1742
02:06:41,180 --> 02:06:47,700
that bad I'm glad you're validating that other people are also there doing

1743
02:06:47,780 --> 02:06:53,420
doing this along with me so I'm not enabling you though no I have changed

1744
02:06:53,420 --> 02:06:59,340
I'm now reformed hopefully it sticks is the question because you know it's like

1745
02:06:59,340 --> 02:07:06,060
two weeks we're two weeks out of this so but I did not miss the phone but when

1746
02:07:06,060 --> 02:07:11,460
it was time to get it again I reached for it in this dark locker it's just a

1747
02:07:11,460 --> 02:07:16,660
single phone and it honestly felt like I was reaching for the ring from Lord the

1748
02:07:16,660 --> 02:07:22,060
Rings you know in Gandalf we just down for it and I and it felt like hot in my

1749
02:07:22,060 --> 02:07:25,900
hand and I went to sit down because I was eating breakfast with my friend she

1750
02:07:25,900 --> 02:07:28,500
would she's the one who had convinced me so she was there finally we could talk

1751
02:07:28,500 --> 02:07:36,500
and it was like I was talking to her but like my attention mentally was on that

1752
02:07:36,500 --> 02:07:43,140
phone and and I thought wow it's so strange because then she got up she left

1753
02:07:43,300 --> 02:07:49,180
and I turned it on and I saw like my usual you know notifications okay text from

1754
02:07:49,180 --> 02:07:54,740
mom and dad like okay check my you know Instagram real quick check YouTube real

1755
02:07:54,740 --> 02:08:01,100
quick cat check Twitter real quick and then I thought really like this is this

1756
02:08:01,100 --> 02:08:06,420
is the thing yeah but like this is what all the consternation is about just for

1757
02:08:06,420 --> 02:08:12,380
those like four or five in things of engagement that then you just cycle

1758
02:08:12,380 --> 02:08:20,300
between all day for what you know and what satisfaction did that give you and

1759
02:08:20,300 --> 02:08:24,980
that moment you got nothing out of that you got not a damn thing not as much as

1760
02:08:24,980 --> 02:08:29,180
satisfaction as you had talking to your best friend over you know over breakfast

1761
02:08:29,180 --> 02:08:34,820
a minute ago and so the whole ride home we had a long ride so I had a long time

1762
02:08:34,820 --> 02:08:38,580
to think about it and I said okay it has to change like the relationship has to

1763
02:08:38,580 --> 02:08:43,220
change like it has utility it is the must in modern life but you have to change

1764
02:08:43,220 --> 02:08:48,540
that it should not be moving on your person at all times like again it's

1765
02:08:48,540 --> 02:08:54,020
it's like the ring it's like the ring where when I'm walking around and I have

1766
02:08:54,020 --> 02:08:58,380
my hand in my coat because it's SF so it's cold all the time my hand is around

1767
02:08:58,380 --> 02:09:06,300
the phone you know like that like that level of engagement with it or what if

1768
02:09:06,300 --> 02:09:09,780
I'm around the house it's in my back pocket if I'm at my desk it's sitting

1769
02:09:09,780 --> 02:09:14,140
right here on the desk if I'm standing in the kitchen it's it's on the on the

1770
02:09:14,140 --> 02:09:18,500
counter next to me if I'm in the bathroom it's in the bathroom with me if I'm in my

1771
02:09:18,500 --> 02:09:23,660
bedroom it's on my side table why such an intense like it is it's like I'm

1772
02:09:23,700 --> 02:09:29,900
attached to it and and so I said okay no it's gonna live in the kitchen 24 7 it's

1773
02:09:29,900 --> 02:09:34,020
not gonna be here next to you if you need it you can get up use it in the

1774
02:09:34,020 --> 02:09:38,500
kitchen then you can leave it there and come back and that has been the new

1775
02:09:38,500 --> 02:09:41,700
system so it's not allowed in the bathroom it's not allowed in the bedroom

1776
02:09:41,700 --> 02:09:48,220
nowhere it just lives in the kitchen and that has been really really good I

1777
02:09:48,220 --> 02:09:53,620
keep trying to break it but I'm like nope don't forget you know I need to do it

1778
02:09:53,620 --> 02:09:57,220
for 30 days and then it'll hopefully stick from there and I don't have to

1779
02:09:57,220 --> 02:10:03,020
force it as much well that's yeah that's a great insight that you tapped into and

1780
02:10:03,020 --> 02:10:08,540
you're inspiring me I should probably do the same thing I might need the 10-day

1781
02:10:08,540 --> 02:10:14,580
retreat yeah like jolt me into it yeah it's ironic because we're both content

1782
02:10:14,580 --> 02:10:18,260
creators or influencers or however you want to put it but it's like we make our

1783
02:10:18,260 --> 02:10:22,300
career online mm-hmm and a lot of the things that we're spreading our awareness

1784
02:10:22,340 --> 02:10:28,060
about your behavior which if you listen to us you might get offline so we're

1785
02:10:28,060 --> 02:10:34,620
like wait don't don't don't listen to us too much yeah yeah I but I also think

1786
02:10:34,620 --> 02:10:41,380
that you know when I was on the retreat a lot of the time I actually was thinking

1787
02:10:41,380 --> 02:10:44,180
about when you know when you have breaks and stuff and you're not you're not

1788
02:10:44,180 --> 02:10:49,120
like meditating I was thinking about a lot of movie scenes I was thinking about

1789
02:10:49,160 --> 02:10:54,280
TV shows certain quotes that were sticking out to me and like even books

1790
02:10:54,280 --> 02:10:58,560
certain books and I thought that's one thing I realized is that because of my

1791
02:10:58,560 --> 02:11:03,200
phone addiction I actually deprioritize all the things that I genuinely love and

1792
02:11:03,200 --> 02:11:09,480
I mentioned family and friends and my husband but I actually even even art like

1793
02:11:09,480 --> 02:11:13,720
sitting and watching Lord of the Rings felt feels like oh it takes too much

1794
02:11:13,720 --> 02:11:18,240
time out of the day but me being on the phone for four hours you know not

1795
02:11:18,280 --> 02:11:22,640
cumulate are not all at once but cumulatively throughout the day yeah

1796
02:11:22,640 --> 02:11:27,800
I'm probably on the phone for four four hours so that's okay doing something

1797
02:11:27,800 --> 02:11:32,520
that brings you no joy but watching something really nice or even a you

1798
02:11:32,520 --> 02:11:35,960
know a YouTube video that you like that you find informative interesting

1799
02:11:35,960 --> 02:11:40,920
whatever versus just mindlessly scrolling and I think that was actually the

1800
02:11:40,920 --> 02:11:45,680
big thing is that I'm still you know I'm still consuming things but it's stuff

1801
02:11:45,840 --> 02:11:50,560
it's just being about more mindful and what impact it has on me I think that

1802
02:11:50,560 --> 02:11:55,760
that was the shift is that engaging actually engaging with art on a day-to-day

1803
02:11:55,760 --> 02:12:01,400
basis versus scrolling Twitter where I had I go through you know 15 different

1804
02:12:01,400 --> 02:12:07,480
types of emotion in rapid succession in under a minute you know what does that

1805
02:12:07,480 --> 02:12:11,800
really do for me I'm outraged at this and excited by that and I'm building to

1806
02:12:11,800 --> 02:12:15,200
this and what does that do for me versus sitting and watching something that I

1807
02:12:15,200 --> 02:12:21,240
actually really like or find find interesting one of my favorite quotes

1808
02:12:21,240 --> 02:12:25,920
is from Terrence McKenna he says if you don't have a plan you become a part of

1809
02:12:25,920 --> 02:12:31,200
somebody else's plan and I think about that quote all the time it's like nobody

1810
02:12:31,200 --> 02:12:34,360
wakes up in the morning and says today I'm going to spend eight hours on my

1811
02:12:34,360 --> 02:12:41,440
phone nobody does that right but once you slip into a subconscious state which

1812
02:12:41,480 --> 02:12:47,880
we operate on 95% of the time your mind just reaches for those programs that are

1813
02:12:47,880 --> 02:12:52,840
like deep grooves in your your mind yeah and like the more you do in action the

1814
02:12:52,840 --> 02:12:57,160
deeper the groove is going to be in your mind it's like skiing down a mountain

1815
02:12:57,160 --> 02:13:02,760
yeah and so you know it's it's like such a deep program like there's certain

1816
02:13:02,760 --> 02:13:08,200
apps on my phone that I go to all the time and my my finger will automatically

1817
02:13:08,200 --> 02:13:13,080
scroll and search for that if I move that yeah my thumb like wait where'd that

1818
02:13:13,080 --> 02:13:18,160
go hmm do it subconsciously and then wait you know I'll do it without thinking

1819
02:13:18,160 --> 02:13:22,360
yes like I used to go to Facebook so much that I would go on the computer and

1820
02:13:22,360 --> 02:13:27,040
then my fingers would just type in FAC and I'm like I don't even want to go to

1821
02:13:27,040 --> 02:13:31,640
Facebook right now why am I doing this or even that moment where I'll like close

1822
02:13:31,640 --> 02:13:36,000
the app only to reopen it and not even realize like I just closed it and I

1823
02:13:36,040 --> 02:13:41,800
reopened it and even the instinct that if if my phone is on my desk I will just

1824
02:13:41,800 --> 02:13:47,120
instinctively instinctively reach for it and it is that that yeah like you're

1825
02:13:47,120 --> 02:13:52,120
saying it has those groove marks right it's built in after years and years and

1826
02:13:52,120 --> 02:13:58,080
that's why that what what you learn at the Bush now is that craving it's a

1827
02:13:58,080 --> 02:14:03,000
craving and you have to meet it immediately and so you just leap to meet

1828
02:14:03,000 --> 02:14:07,080
it immediately so having that creating that disconnection and recognizing it's

1829
02:14:07,080 --> 02:14:13,320
that it's just it's that slight form of distance space between the craving craving

1830
02:14:13,320 --> 02:14:17,400
coming up and you resolving it instead going oh look at that craving I have a

1831
02:14:17,400 --> 02:14:21,120
craving to be on my phone right now why okay because I just reached something

1832
02:14:21,120 --> 02:14:27,280
hard in in the script in the in my next video script that I don't know how to

1833
02:14:27,280 --> 02:14:32,960
resolve and I feel inadequate I feel like maybe I'm not good enough for this

1834
02:14:32,960 --> 02:14:36,400
maybe I'm not good enough for for what I'm trying to be maybe I'll never be

1835
02:14:36,400 --> 02:14:41,240
good enough maybe I'll fail at this okay so you're afraid like you know so just

1836
02:14:41,240 --> 02:14:47,200
taking it that's the weird thing about being a human being is that we're so

1837
02:14:47,200 --> 02:14:53,040
fear-based we're so anxiety-based and we make these crazy leaps you know we

1838
02:14:53,080 --> 02:14:58,560
make these crazy leaps of the small thing happens and it'll be like well

1839
02:14:58,560 --> 02:15:02,920
maybe I'll die because of this you know what I mean it's like maybe

1840
02:15:02,920 --> 02:15:08,440
psychologically I'm completely completely you know at risk because of

1841
02:15:08,440 --> 02:15:13,560
this so it's very interesting then then we have these tools to then distract us

1842
02:15:13,560 --> 02:15:18,360
in the moment and keep us away from that that but it exists somewhere it's

1843
02:15:18,360 --> 02:15:24,000
always there so it's better to address it rather than let it just just let it

1844
02:15:24,000 --> 02:15:30,520
hide from you oh yeah that's very inspiring you're I'm definitely gonna

1845
02:15:30,520 --> 02:15:34,400
make some changes after this conversation thank you thank you for

1846
02:15:34,400 --> 02:15:37,680
saying that and yes I think you'll find I think you'll find the ten day retreat

1847
02:15:37,680 --> 02:15:43,440
really helpful in doing it if you know if yeah I'll send you I'll send you some

1848
02:15:43,440 --> 02:15:47,760
stuff about it after yeah I'd love to check it out clearly becoming a bit

1849
02:15:47,960 --> 02:15:54,680
pushy well I like it that it's not it's not led by a guru or something right

1850
02:15:54,680 --> 02:15:59,560
it's kind of just your own experience yeah and they're very anti-ego it's a

1851
02:15:59,560 --> 02:16:06,080
very anti-ego like anytime there's a group that's led by one individual who's

1852
02:16:06,080 --> 02:16:10,200
got like all the answers I'm always like I'm not really into cults you know like

1853
02:16:10,200 --> 02:16:15,000
that's not my thing yeah but this sounds like a very personal journey which

1854
02:16:15,160 --> 02:16:18,960
I've always been drawn towards those experiences like sensory deprivation

1855
02:16:18,960 --> 02:16:24,960
tank or psychedelic journey or something like that yeah those have kind of sparked

1856
02:16:24,960 --> 02:16:28,680
my interest more because it's like I don't know you're just grappling with

1857
02:16:28,680 --> 02:16:34,480
your own inner journey hmm exactly I think this you know micro dosing around

1858
02:16:34,480 --> 02:16:40,360
psychedelics is is fascinating it's really really interesting yeah it's

1859
02:16:40,360 --> 02:16:44,400
something I've covered a lot of my channel yeah but it's definitely not the

1860
02:16:44,520 --> 02:16:49,680
all-end-all cure like people are going crazy with it now yeah it's that I like

1861
02:16:49,680 --> 02:16:52,760
by the way I like how you think in quotes because I feel like I think in

1862
02:16:52,760 --> 02:16:57,720
scenes and like movie scenes I think you think in quotes and you come up with the

1863
02:16:57,720 --> 02:17:02,840
best ones they like the exact right quotes but there's that that that one I

1864
02:17:02,840 --> 02:17:07,800
think it's a Carl Jung quote that don't be careful of unearned wisdom am I am I

1865
02:17:07,800 --> 02:17:13,480
right about that I'll have to look into that one that's a good one be careful of

1866
02:17:13,480 --> 02:17:17,000
unearned wisdom yeah and I think it relates to this is that you know

1867
02:17:17,000 --> 02:17:22,240
psychedelics is if people think that it's an easy route to wisdom but it's
