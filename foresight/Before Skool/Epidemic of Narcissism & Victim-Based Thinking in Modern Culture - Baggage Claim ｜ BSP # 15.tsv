0	10000	Today, we have an awesome guest, the creator of Baggage Claim.
10000	11000	Welcome.
11000	12000	Hi.
12000	13000	Hi, Mark.
13000	14000	How are you?
14000	15000	Good.
15000	16000	How are you?
16000	17000	Good.
17000	18000	Thanks for having me.
18000	19000	Of course.
19000	20000	I love your channel.
20000	21000	And I find it so refreshing.
21000	25640	And on Baggage Claim, you talk about cultural issues, but you take a really nice philosophical
25640	29240	approach to them and, you know, it's so confusing.
29240	31520	We live in such a time of chaos.
31520	36400	And to hear your take has been just refreshing as the word that comes to mind.
36400	37400	Thank you so much.
37400	39000	And I feel the same way about after school.
39000	42080	I absolutely love your channel, consume everything.
42080	49440	And I've been very inspired by how you, you have these takes where you'll draw really
49440	54040	good parallels without actually mentioning the particular issues that you're talking
54040	55040	about.
55040	58240	And I think in that way, you make your videos so timeless and universal.
58240	62800	So that's actually really been inspiring me to, to be better at doing that.
62800	64360	Oh, well, thank you.
64360	68600	That means a lot, especially coming from you, great creator.
68600	74500	So yeah, before we, this video will come out right after our collaboration comes out.
74500	76160	So we can talk about that.
76160	81320	But first I'd love to hear about just what were you doing before you started your channel?
81320	82320	Sure.
82320	89120	I, for a better part of a decade, I've been working in the startup space.
89120	91960	And so doing something completely else, that's not really where I started.
91960	96480	I started off as an accountant and then slowly got entered into startups.
96480	99080	I was inspired by my brother to move up to the Bay Area.
99080	104120	I used to live in Los Angeles before that and then moved to the Bay Area and really
104120	109980	enjoyed that aspect of sort of learning on the job, you know, at a startup, you kind
109980	113060	of wear multiple hats, you have to do whatever it takes.
113060	116500	So I learned a lot, but I kept kind of missing something.
116500	121220	I kept feeling like there was a part of me that just kind of realized that I was not
121220	123260	really meant for the job.
123260	127340	In a lot of ways, I'm, I wasn't really enjoying it.
127340	128620	It felt very forced.
128620	133620	I was kind of forcing myself into this particular mold of being this big exec.
133620	138940	I had this, you know, big dreams of, of that I was going to be this big executive.
138940	143740	And the more I got into it, the more unhappy I became.
143740	149260	And so I finally sort of got to that point, I think around the 30 mark, I've heard a lot
149260	153340	of people share similar stories where you stop trying to force yourself into being something.
153340	157300	You finally just acknowledge what you are and what you could be if you stopped trying
157300	159020	to force things.
159020	163020	And I just reached that point and I said, you know, I don't want to do this anymore.
163020	165540	I was fantasizing about YouTube videos.
165540	172700	I was thinking a lot about, uh, about, uh, you know, I was thinking in video essay form.
172700	174340	And I said, okay, I think it's time.
174340	176180	I think it's time to, to leave all that.
176180	181020	And it was a good time because 2020 happened, you know, all the madness that happened with
181020	182020	2020.
182020	185340	And it was a good time to take a pause and step back because everybody was kind of separated
185340	186340	out anyway.
186340	189660	So there wasn't enough distraction of the world.
189660	193620	And that's when I came up with the concept of baggage claim.
193620	201820	And it, I was motivated by wanting to talk about, uh, issues, personal issues, professional
201820	207700	issues, psychological issues that people might have on an individual level, but also culturally,
207700	210340	what are things that we can't sort of see eye to eye on?
210340	212140	And where can we meet in the middle?
212140	215140	Because things were becoming more and more polarized, more and people were getting angrier
215140	216980	and angrier and angrier.
216980	220140	And, um, being in, you know, I'm, I'm based in San Francisco.
220140	226220	So being in San Francisco, things just over the last 10 years just became so polarized.
226220	233540	And my opinions that I thought were perfectly acceptable before were suddenly completely
233540	238300	being ostracized, especially I had to be really, really quiet in professional settings or
238300	242740	people were making assumptions about how I think politically, just based on the color
242740	245260	of my skin or my gender.
245260	250340	And so I found those instances very strange and I said, this is, this, this can't be the
250340	251620	future of our society.
251620	254660	We have to be headed in a better place.
254660	261100	And so, and that's what really inspired me to, to start thinking about, about what I
261100	264820	could be contributing to that conversation.
264820	266060	Hmm.
266060	273460	So you basically got so uncomfortable in that startup environment that it pushed you to
273780	275660	express your creativity.
275660	280060	That story really resonates with me because I have, I had a similar thing where you feel
280060	285460	like you're just a cognitive machine and you feel like you're not being able to be creative.
285460	289180	And that's kind of what people are put on earth to do is be creative.
289180	293940	And if you're not doing that, you, you just, you feel completely inauthentic and it's almost
293940	296900	like you have a psychological death.
296900	301100	And so now are you doing a baggage claim full time?
301100	302100	Yes.
302100	303100	Full time.
303100	307060	And so just, you know, what you said, I also found that so much of my work, because I never
307060	309660	really thought of myself as a very creative person.
309660	312860	Even though I used to write a lot of stories when I was a kid, I just didn't think of myself
312860	313860	like that.
313860	319020	And my role just became sort of babysitting a lot of people, making sure that they did
319020	320020	their job.
320020	325300	That kind of became my everyday job was, Hey, can you make sure that people meet their deadlines?
325300	329940	And I found that to be such a strange idea that there was no self governance for a lot
329940	333900	of people and they would find reasons to justify not getting their work done.
333900	339940	And, and I was just going around chasing things down and, and people, people were very kind
339940	345020	about, you know, pushing this narrative that I'm, oh, I'm the woman who gets shit done.
345020	350180	You know, that was kind of the tagline under my slack was, you know, she gets shit done.
350180	354620	And, and yet I found, well, why, why am I doing that?
354620	357140	Is that really helping people at the end of the day?
357140	359140	Is that actually contributing anything positive?
359180	362740	I just felt like a, I just felt kind of like a fetcher of sorts.
362740	364900	So, you know, it's, it's what you're saying.
364900	368940	It's that psychological death because you're actually not being as productive as you could
368940	369940	be.
370940	373060	Well, you are definitely getting shit done on your channel.
374140	375140	Yeah.
376940	383660	So I've been really hyper focused on the issues that you talk about on your channel, because
384660	388860	movies in particular seem to be at the center of the culture war now.
388860	389860	Yes.
389860	395460	And it seems like our modern movies have been overtaken by some sort of rot within.
396460	403660	And I've been really into channels like critical drinker and nerd Roddick and your channel.
405540	410860	And I'm curious to know like your answer is just why are modern movies failing to connect
410860	411860	with audiences?
412860	419620	I think, honestly, analyzing that question ends up answering a bigger question around
419620	422780	what's wrong with society in general.
422780	427820	And it could be perfectly summed up with we are caught up in this pursuit of the overly
427820	430100	simplistic approach.
430100	437660	I think if you think about the appeal of going the simple route is because it's possible
437660	440100	today because of the advent of social media.
440140	446900	So if I have a particular opinion, if I take it online, I could put that out there and
446900	450020	immediately get likes, whatever that opinion might be.
450020	457100	So I can build up a reputation pretty easily by minimal effort and just say things that
457100	462740	are particularly popular or, you know, rile people up, whatever, whatever my base level
462740	464660	goal might be.
464700	473860	And that sort of thinking has really translated into movie making because to make a good movie,
473860	475260	it takes a lot of work.
475260	476980	It takes so much effort.
476980	479220	And this is something Chris Gore talked about.
479220	483740	He and I were messaging back and forth about this a couple of weeks ago.
483740	489700	And someone who wrote for his website Film Threat talked about that there's this perception
489700	492980	that movie making is actually really simple and anyone can do it.
492980	500460	And there's like a form of jealousy, but also this marginalization of the effort.
500460	505580	And there's not that realization that to put something together, that's a good narrative,
505580	512420	you know, good structure, good, a good heart to it, good dialogue even takes a lot of thought,
512420	518900	takes a lot of experience, a lot of consternation, a lot of collaboration to come up with something
518900	520700	like that.
520700	528420	And that's not really the approach that modern writers that have gotten into these writer
528420	533060	rooms because they meet certain diversity criteria.
533060	535300	They don't think like that.
535300	547340	And a lot of the identity politics is rooted around that belief that ability is not really
547940	552140	something that can be achieved through effort.
552140	557740	Ability is inherent to your experience or, you know, you're the color of your skin.
557740	563340	So for example, and I was talking about this on NerdRotix channel last week that there's
563340	570940	that belief that a woman who checks certain boxes has something really unique to say.
570940	576740	Because if you I don't know if you know, but Disney released a new TV show called Echo,
576740	582740	and it's it hits it's like the intersectional gold mine, so to speak, because the main character
582740	590700	Maya is a woman, she's indigenous, she's deaf, and she is an amputee.
590700	597780	So she just hits so many, you know, checked boxes that all the people have to sort of
597780	603740	step back and bow down and say, you know, this woman's going to offer us an understanding
603740	608640	that's going to be so unique that nobody's ever, you know, could could even perceive what
608640	613580	she might have to say or if she, you know, if she can't speak but represent.
613580	619980	And that is just such a falsehood of belief that we are all so individually unique.
619980	623540	It's that idea of saying like everybody's special and such a and everybody has such
623540	625300	a unique thing to do.
625300	633580	The thing is everybody has value to add, but we are a lot more similar than we are different.
633860	640140	What makes a story good is when it speaks to universal truths that hit close to home
640140	646660	that can actually, you know, they actually get to your heart, not because you look a
646660	652020	certain way or you you you have a certain background, but it's because of the universal
652020	654100	human experience.
654100	660180	And this past weekend when I was watching I was watching the behind the scenes for Lord
660220	665540	of the Rings, which is the greatest trilogy of all time created of all time.
665540	669220	And I love watching the behind the scenes more than even sometimes watching the movie.
669220	677740	I like watching the behind the scenes because it shows you the Herculean effort that a lot
677740	681620	of people put for a better part of 10 years.
681620	689820	And if you look at the entire sort of like vast variety of like production and cast from
689860	695300	top to bottom, everybody poured their soul into that that piece of work.
695940	701140	And I love seeing that because that's what art takes.
701140	706460	As you know, you know, that's what art takes is that it takes almost everything out of
706460	711940	you for you to create something beautiful, something that a lot of people can identify
711940	715340	with. And I don't mean identify in the identity perspective.
715380	721060	I mean, from the humanist experience perspective, and you see that that, you know, Peter Jackson
721060	725340	set the tone of the main push behind that whole project.
725580	730700	And everyone followed suit, all the production people, all the artists, you know, they even
730700	737300	thought about that the cultural significance of what it means to be from Rohan and how
737300	742100	significant horses would be and where, you know, farmland would be placed.
742100	745780	They thought about all those little details versus what would it be like for Gondor?
746020	750780	I mean, that's how how much that they really put put thought into that.
750780	756060	And it showed, even if you didn't catch every little detail, it showed in the project as a whole.
756300	762620	And it transformed all of their lives, the art and their their willingness to engage
762620	767580	with that art, transform their lives, but it transformed so many millions and millions
767580	771620	of people watch that and continue and will continue forever to watch that and be
771620	772860	transformed for it by it.
773220	780020	And I don't enjoy that movie or that story because there's, you know, a brown
780020	787380	girl who's happens to be Indian and an immigrant and is, you know, has has black hair
787380	789980	and is nearsighted is in that movie.
790260	793580	What value does that add to me?
794020	798020	You know, and it's a very that's a very narcissistic perspective to say, I need the
798020	801460	hero that's accomplishing great things to look just like me.
802180	806900	That's such a that's such a surface level way to engage with a movie.
806900	809500	But that's what modern movie makers really expect.
809820	810420	And what is that?
810420	811740	It comes back to that same idea.
812020	818420	That's the easy thing to do and say, you should enjoy this movie because the
818420	820020	heroine looks like you.
820260	824140	And that's what the entire promotion for Echo was exactly that.
824180	827060	It was our main character is deaf.
827100	828020	Our main character is deaf.
828060	829260	It's she's indigenous.
829260	829860	She's this.
829860	830820	She's body positive.
830820	831220	She's this.
831500	837620	It's just all these little things that are so easy to do is the main promotion of
837620	840100	that TV of that TV show.
840500	846180	But the actual value that's that someone might be able to get to see a story that
846180	850100	transcends time, that transcends space, but speaks to that human experience of what
850100	852020	does it take to do something really hard?
852300	855460	Lord of the Rings, what does it take to do a really difficult task?
855980	857340	And how does it change you?
857340	861660	How does it, how does it, what does it mean to go up against evil?
861980	865740	And how can that evil touch your heart and almost destroy you, almost kill you in
865740	866500	that process?
866860	870660	I mean, that's the human story that a lot of people connect with.
872180	878740	And so I think that's really the problem is that there's not that willingness to
878740	885380	do the hard thing because there's a lack of recognition that that it's even
885380	886220	worth the doing.
886540	887860	It's like, just take the easier route.
888580	890100	Just go for representation.
890540	894380	And that's, and there's a whole group of people that are reinforcing that
894380	897140	perspective amongst those writer rooms.
899820	900980	Wow, you just said it all.
901380	904700	You just hit so many different things that I want to talk about.
905260	909940	Um, and I think at the core of it, the, the writing is, is really falling off a
909940	913180	cliff and they don't have anything new to say.
913540	915140	They're not telling any new stories.
915980	917900	They're not speaking to these universal truth.
918580	923740	And perhaps that's why they're so focused on these materialistic identity
923740	929300	things, because if you take that identity aspect away from it, what is it?
929300	931860	It's just an empty, there's nothing behind that.
932540	936340	So perhaps that's why they are pushing that so hard because that's the only
936340	937740	new thing they're bringing to the table.
938900	942140	Otherwise it's like, well, why are you making this movie that nobody asked for?
943020	947420	We're making it because the genitalia of the new care of the main character is
947420	947740	different.
947780	950060	That's why we have to remake this $300 million movie.
950780	954060	And it's like, okay, I guess if it's that important to you, I guess it's worth
954060	958740	remaking, but I love that you spoke about Lord of the Rings because that's
959180	960620	my favorite movie by far.
961300	966180	And I think I've literally watched that same behind the scenes video and I
966180	968780	can't watch Lord of the Rings without pointing out like, you don't want to
968780	972540	watch Lord of the Rings with me because I'm going to be like, Viggo Mortensen
972540	975020	broke his foot in this scene, you know, he broke his toe.
975540	978740	That's the first thing I thought I was like, you know, I think the same thing.
978740	979100	Yeah.
979340	980340	Like, did you know?
980420	980900	Yeah.
982100	982340	Yeah.
982340	983140	I'm in the same way.
983900	987180	Lord of the Rings is so deep and so good.
987180	988940	It's such a, it's a symmetrical story.
988980	992820	You have like nine members of the fellowship and then you have these nine
992820	996860	Nazgul who are like the shadow side of them chasing them and then you have the
996860	999260	good wizard and then you have the dark wizard.
999820	1002780	And then you have like elves and dwarves that contradict each other.
1003340	1007340	And then the Urukay, the orcs are like literally dark elves.
1007340	1010180	They are like dug up from the earth and they are elves.
1010180	1016860	So it's like, it's almost like a perfect symmetrical psychological mind, the story.
1016860	1018780	It's like, there's a dark side and there's a light side.
1019220	1021940	And without the dark side, what is the Shire?
1022020	1025820	The Shire is like nothing without the dark side, but because the dark is so dark
1025820	1031260	in that story, the good is so good, you know, that the anti-hero defines the heroes.
1032140	1036980	And, um, I never thought about it that way, I never thought about it that way.
1036980	1038660	I never thought about the symmetry.
1038740	1039740	That's very interesting.
1039740	1041140	That's, and so true.
1041340	1042740	I never, I never looked at it that way.
1042980	1045500	Really good stories have great symmetry.
1045940	1048340	Like I've, I've been rewatching Breaking Bad.
1049100	1054540	And that story is very similar because Walter White is sick and he's kind
1054540	1058620	of dying, he's on his way out, but at the same time, his wife is pregnant.
1058660	1059860	She's bringing life in.
1060420	1062660	So you have this nice symmetry to the story.
1062660	1069380	You have his son in the above world, which is the, his son with his wife.
1069380	1072420	And then he has his son in the dark world, which is Jesse.
1073540	1078900	It's, um, and then every character in the dark world has good qualities.
1079100	1083860	And every character in the above world has these dark qualities, like his
1083900	1087700	sister-in-law steals, you know, everybody does these like things that you're like,
1087700	1088900	maybe they're not so good.
1088900	1090340	Maybe all the good people aren't so good.
1090900	1095180	And he's got this like shadow side that he taps into and whenever he does that,
1095180	1096500	you're like, yes, come on, Walter.
1098420	1100460	Well, I, I didn't, I never looked at that.
1100460	1104060	So that's, that's the thing I, you know, I, that's, that's amazing.
1104060	1104540	I love that.
1104540	1108460	I can see why then you appreciate these things even more, you know,
1108460	1110100	seeing the deep layers of everything.
1111100	1111500	Yes.
1111500	1114620	And, and like you were saying with, with modern movies, there, there
1114620	1116820	isn't really much thought to like the symmetry.
1116820	1118140	It's very one dimensional.
1118140	1122140	Like you see a white guy on the screen and you're like, okay, he's the bad guy.
1123140	1123500	All right.
1123740	1126300	And you don't get much more depth to that.
1127060	1128740	No, no, you don't.
1129140	1133460	And the, what you were saying, you know, you can see with the writing around the
1133460	1136620	laziness of everything, you know, taking the easy route for everything.
1137260	1142380	And, um, one of the things that I hate that, that's kind of come along
1142380	1148140	with is the amount of cursing in, in every, every single, um, script.
1148620	1152220	Because so, you know, there's some comedians that'll say, you know, I'm
1152220	1154180	going to work clean, like Will Smith is one of them.
1154180	1156140	He, he always said that he was going to work clean.
1156180	1160700	I obviously broke that cursing, like crazy during the Oscar night.
1160740	1164420	Um, but he's, he's always been one of those people who says like, I'm not
1164460	1165060	going to curse.
1165060	1172180	And, and I think with cursing, it's very easy to convey anger by just
1172180	1174180	using certain four letter words.
1174740	1178340	Um, it takes a lot of effort to convey it otherwise.
1178340	1180980	And I think that's again, one of those things that really bothers me about
1180980	1186420	like every now, you know, new TV show has cursing in it rather than actually
1186620	1192420	working with the language, the English language to create, create dialogue
1192420	1196100	that's engaging and interesting and like gives you full nuance of someone's
1196100	1199980	character and feelings without having to rely on something like that.
1200060	1202820	Which is what was nice about network TV in the past is that that's
1202820	1204980	what it kind of demanded.
1204980	1205900	It said, you can't curse.
1205900	1209900	So a lot of people, but that limitation had to make sure that they
1209900	1213100	were going to be really good at, at their mastery of the English language.
1213420	1216540	And that's now without that limitation, people just kind of go with them,
1216660	1217940	you know, lowest denominator.
1218260	1221900	Again, I know that I sound like such a, such a, you know, buddy,
1221900	1226420	daddy saying stuff like that, but I just really want to defend the English language.
1228060	1232500	Well, I, I completely agree with you because if you don't have a lot of
1232500	1235700	cursing, when, and you do have cursing, it, it really has weight to it.
1236700	1240180	I have seen that where there's certain shows where they're saying the F
1240180	1243660	word in every other sentence and it's kind of like, it just becomes a filler word.
1244380	1244820	Yes.
1244820	1246660	Kind of like the word like, you know.
1247140	1247500	Yeah.
1247500	1248780	It's in succession.
1248780	1251740	That's one of the reasons I couldn't get into succession is that every
1251740	1253140	other word was the F word.
1253820	1260420	And what I liked about, um, what was interesting about Sex and the City was
1260420	1265620	that there's a, I mean gratuitous amount of, uh, you know, sex scenes and nudity
1265620	1266500	and all this stuff.
1266860	1269780	But when it came to Sarah Jessica Parker's character, one of the things
1269780	1274740	she said when they started working on that, she said, I know it's HBO and
1274740	1279740	we can do anything, but I feel like my character being a writer should not be
1279740	1284020	cursing all the time, that when she does curse, like you're saying, it adds that
1284020	1286980	weight to it because that's the point is that she's a writer.
1286980	1290460	She's, she should be good at communicating her emotions without having to
1291340	1295900	devolve to that or resolve to that resort.
1295900	1296140	Sorry.
1296140	1297260	That's the word I was trying to think of.
1297620	1303260	And so what those times that she would say, you know what F him that like hit
1303260	1307380	really hard because that's, that was atypical for her to say something like
1307380	1310740	that, you know, I, I am a big fan of that show.
1311020	1316980	You are has, and like you were saying before, um, it has universal truths.
1317460	1321500	So you don't have to look exactly like the people in the show to get it.
1322220	1326820	And the swearing aspect, I remember the first episode of that show had the best
1326820	1330260	writing of any show I've ever seen because she asked Mr.
1330260	1332540	Big, have you ever been in love?
1333420	1335460	And he says abs a fucking Lutley.
1335820	1336140	Yeah.
1336340	1340740	And you, you're like, okay, this is not going to be a traditional romance show
1340780	1346180	because he just swore while talking about something that's very traditionally
1346180	1347460	romantic, but he just swore.
1347460	1349420	So this is not going to be that type of story.
1349980	1350380	Right.
1351020	1352820	I could go on on that show as well.
1353260	1353500	Yeah.
1353500	1355620	The writing for that show is really good.
1355940	1357900	It is incredibly good.
1358340	1363100	As good as that writing is, it's exactly the opposite when it comes to the reboot.
1363420	1369420	And just like that is so poorly written, you can just see, yeah, you can just
1369420	1373660	see sort of the evolution of, of writer rooms just from that.
1373660	1377500	Because I think it's a lot of the same people still involved, but you can just
1377500	1381740	see how the situation has really changed and, and talent has sort of devolved.
1382780	1383100	Yeah.
1383380	1383620	Yeah.
1383620	1387140	Well, I think that show got consumed by identity politics as well.
1387700	1388100	Yes.
1388700	1389180	Yes.
1389460	1390100	I mean, Mr.
1390100	1392380	Big technically is canceled.
1392420	1395100	Forget Chris Knoth, the actor who plays Mr.
1395100	1396980	Big, but Mr.
1396980	1398460	Big, the idea of Mr.
1398460	1404420	Big is unacceptable in, in today's world because, you know, he's, he, he is what
1405660	1409700	he represented everything that was emblematic of New York in the 90s, right?
1409700	1415900	Extremely kind of bigger, larger than life, uh, you know, uh, very masculine,
1415940	1421860	very sort of has his own way to everything very intrans, intransigent, uh,
1421860	1427780	and extremely, uh, rich, which is like what the whole show is about.
1427780	1432500	The whole show is about consumerism, you know, essentially it's about shoes.
1432500	1434780	It's about all the best clothing.
1434780	1439700	I mean, that was so much about it, but also about trying to find love at a time
1440060	1443420	where New York was kind of past love, right?
1443420	1444460	Past romance.
1445020	1449740	And so it's, it's interesting because now they're trying to kind of, you know,
1449740	1451380	they, they participate in all that.
1451540	1455300	And now they're trying to prove that they've evolved beyond all of it.
1455540	1460500	And, uh, you know, think that by killing off of a character, an iconic character,
1460500	1463700	they can kind of claim moral high ground.
1466100	1466460	Yeah.
1466460	1472460	I've noticed that there's been a decline of, of romance in media and just in
1472460	1476820	general, um, you can even look at like statistics with Gen Z.
1477260	1477620	Yes.
1477620	1479620	There's less romance, less children.
1480060	1484300	Um, yeah, what, what do you think that's about less romance?
1486460	1490620	I think so this is, this is actually kind of perfect to talk about because I've
1490620	1496460	been, uh, neck deep in this feminist video that I seem to be working on forever.
1496460	1500940	I started writing it in December and I'm finally, I think almost done with the
1500940	1505420	editing and, uh, what, as part of that, so the question I've been trying to
1505420	1510900	answer is like, how has feminism helped our society and how has it hurt it?
1511060	1516220	Because I think we tend to take, at least out in the open, people tend to take a
1516220	1518260	very sort of polarized view on everything.
1518260	1520420	Oh, feminism sucks or feminism is great.
1520700	1523780	What about the middle ground is kind of what I wanted to dive into.
1524460	1529420	And so as part of that, I've read a lot of the writings of, of feminist thinkers,
1529860	1531580	you know, across the 20th century.
1531580	1538660	And the one that I found that I found to be the strangest was this woman called,
1538700	1541460	uh, fire, uh, Shula myth firestone.
1541860	1547460	And she, uh, you know, passed away recently in 2012, she, but in, in the 1970s,
1547460	1550820	she was quite active and she wrote this book called the dialectic of sex.
1551420	1558340	And in that she laid out what the future needed to look like, excuse me.
1560020	1565260	Needed to look like in order for it to actually be fair for men and women.
1565980	1570340	And she was building on a lot of the ideas that previous, um, previous feminists
1570340	1574540	had had come out with, but there were a couple of points that she made.
1575060	1580740	And one of them was around, um, around men and women just being indistinguishable,
1581420	1584740	uh, physically, that they should be indistinguishable, that you should not be
1584740	1589780	able to tell, um, the difference, and that women should not be responsible
1589780	1594620	for bearing children, uh, because of the pain and anguish attached to that.
1595180	1600260	And that, um, children should be bought, born in pods, little, little, you know,
1600460	1605420	pods outside of women's bodies and that children should not even be raised
1605420	1607380	by their genetic parents.
1608100	1613300	Um, so, and that, and that the nuclear family should be eradicated.
1614140	1619140	So there, all these ideas, and this was pretty consistent with sort of other
1619140	1623100	thinkers, yes, she pushed it even further, uh, by saying that women should, you
1623100	1626820	know, should not bear children period, but there were a lot of feminist thinkers
1626820	1631300	before her, uh, starting from the sixties that were suggesting that women should
1631300	1637620	not engage in, in sort of motherhood and family and in relationships with men,
1637620	1645020	that that was the ultimate, um, feminist move was to just reject any sort of
1645020	1646220	relationship with men.
1646540	1649580	And many of them suggested then, okay, well, how do you fix loneliness?
1649580	1652740	Oh, it's like, oh, engage in lesbianism is, was sort of the answer.
1653300	1658020	Um, so it's that whole idea that women are so much happier without men and men
1658020	1659740	are just useless and get rid of them.
1659740	1663620	And, you know, they're just responsible for the patriarchy and, and, uh, up,
1663660	1667540	up, and the whole, whole, whole board by not even engaging with them.
1667940	1673140	So I think that sort of thinking has been making its way and trickling into
1673140	1678900	various parts of, of sort of the teachings that, that, you know, children go
1678900	1682780	through when they go, go through college, that they, they get indoctrinated with
1682780	1687700	this idea that it's men and it's women and we're against each other.
1687700	1690340	And, you know, there can be only one winner.
1690820	1693980	You know, you don't need to engage with the other side.
1693980	1695260	You don't need to compromise.
1695260	1697180	You don't need to find a way to work together.
1697180	1699860	You don't need to build partnerships with the other, other sex.
1700180	1705180	It's just, you know, it's going to be one winner and it's going to be women.
1705660	1710940	And I think as part of that, then you're seeing those types of thinkers, you know,
1710940	1716060	the, the, the sort of disciples of those, that sort of thinking, then entering
1716140	1716940	writer's room.
1716940	1721380	So any sort of modern writing is not about romance at all.
1721420	1722980	It's actually about domination.
1723340	1726780	So Captain Marvel has no love interest.
1726860	1732980	Her only marriage is because, you know, she's, um, she's, I think, made a political
1732980	1735860	alliance or something in the, in the new Marvel movie.
1735860	1737660	I don't know if you saw that, the Marvels.
1738220	1742700	And yeah, oh, you probably saved yourself some time and time and money.
1742740	1743460	I couldn't do it.
1744380	1749700	There was, uh, uh, uh, an extra scene.
1749740	1751860	I don't know why I'm forgetting the word that deleted scene.
1751860	1752260	There you go.
1752740	1759300	That, uh, nerd Roddick showed on his channel and, uh, in the deleted scene,
1759860	1765580	there was this like very inappropriate lesbian joke made by one character to
1765580	1766780	another, who's underage.
1767460	1773340	So it's very obvious that that, all of that sort of perspective on just cut men
1773340	1777980	out is very strong within the writers and they're just trying to insert it
1778020	1779060	anywhere possible.
1779420	1785460	And so it's old fashioned to be in love with a man and want to form a good
1785460	1786460	partnership with him.
1786460	1787140	It's old fashioned.
1787140	1789100	It's anti feminist to do that.
1789420	1791260	It's anti woman to do that.
1791620	1797580	And you see that even, uh, surface up with that, uh, Rachel Zegler interview
1797820	1802780	where she says, um, you know, there's a big focus on her love story.
1803260	1805180	And she's so sarcastic about it.
1805180	1811140	She's so irritated about it, despite she herself having a boyfriend that she
1811140	1812940	often talks about in references.
1813380	1817140	Uh, and she talks about how the prince could be completely cut from the story.
1817140	1817460	Right.
1817460	1822780	It's, it's who cares about love when there's power to be had, right?
1823180	1826020	And that's one of those things that's very interesting is that that's what.
1826540	1831220	Feminists think of the patriarchy, that the patriarchy only cares about power
1831260	1832460	and they don't care about love.
1833020	1836780	Um, and that's their, that's the very, I think very, you know, we can dive
1836780	1842260	into the patriarchy whenever, but that's a very simple, overly simplistic, uh,
1842740	1844740	understanding of how men think.
1845260	1850140	And so that's, this is their counteraction to that and saying love is a distraction.
1850340	1853340	Love requires compromise.
1853580	1856300	It requires, uh, sacrifice.
1856660	1860420	Um, so why would an individual do that, especially if we're pushing for a
1860420	1864380	very self-first perspective and philosophy in life?
1864820	1871420	So instead we should say, F love, we should go and seek power and leadership.
1872380	1872980	Yikes.
1873220	1878060	Well, it seems like the actions are driven entirely by resentment.
1879020	1883740	You know, there's no, I've heard that you're either driven by gratitude or by resentment.
1884420	1887540	And I think it's very clear that the people creating these movies are
1887540	1888900	driven by resentment now.
1889460	1893980	It's like all about what power do they lack or, you know, how they've been
1893980	1897460	wronged and it all stems from, to me, it all stems from narcissism.
1898140	1900220	Cause there's two types of narcissism.
1900980	1905060	There's the, the form where you think everybody's better than you.
1905500	1907180	So you were entitled to what they have.
1908060	1913100	You, you need to be leveled out or you believe that you are better than everybody
1913100	1914700	else and you're entitled as well.
1914700	1919860	Like both, both views lead to entitlement and that you're better than
1919860	1921940	it, you know, that you come first.
1922340	1922620	Yeah.
1922820	1926140	And so you see that in, in the way that the characters in these movies behave.
1926740	1929420	It's this resentful narcissism.
1930540	1934740	And I don't think it's really connecting with audiences anymore, because if
1934740	1939380	you're looking at the numbers, it's been like flop after flop after flop with
1939380	1941460	these huge budget films.
1941460	1944940	So they're going to either have to correct their mistakes.
1944940	1948460	So they're just going to, they're going to not be able to sustain this, right?
1948980	1950260	Yeah, absolutely.
1950260	1955700	And, um, I think they're going to keep going for some time because the thing
1955700	1960460	is wokeness and I know we'll, we'll, we'll touch on some of this stuff of how
1960460	1967740	it's going to sort of infected companies and cities later, but wokeness is, is
1967740	1974220	such, um, such an infection in that once it enters certain environments, it's
1974220	1976500	very hard to argue against.
1977060	1981940	It's very hard to overthrow and because it's very easy for people who are
1981940	1987580	willing to play that woke game, it's very easy for them to destroy other
1987580	1991180	people's reputations by casting aspersions on their character and calling
1991180	1996500	them racist and bigoted and, and those sorts of, those sorts of terms really
1996500	2001540	stick, you know, you, you say that enough, enough people say it, um, you know, it's
2001540	2003940	very destructive on an individual level.
2003940	2007020	So why would someone sort of stand up to that?
2007260	2011900	And so you just need one or two bad actors from, from a wokeness side to
2011900	2013900	kind of overthrow an entire organization.
2014140	2018060	It's really not that, not that hard because we live in a polite society.
2018060	2019140	We don't want to offend.
2019580	2020900	Uh, we're not brutes.
2021100	2025420	So it's almost like the strengths, the greatest strengths of Western society
2025460	2028620	are getting turned on itself, so to speak.
2029380	2034540	And everything you're saying about the resentment aspect of it, you know, I
2034540	2038500	think one of the best stories ever written is Groundhog Day.
2038820	2040340	And I don't know if you've watched that movie.
2040500	2040980	Have you?
2041420	2042380	I have to now.
2042940	2046860	You, and I think you'll really, I think you'll really enjoy it.
2047420	2051820	And I, you know, without giving, well, you can give it away.
2051820	2052500	I'll still watch it.
2052500	2058380	Um, yeah, I don't want to get, I don't want to ruin the experience for you,
2058380	2063100	but it's not, I mean, I think you can anticipate what the movie might be
2063100	2064700	about the second you start watching it.
2064700	2069380	But the, what's great about that movie is first of all, the premises
2069380	2073820	that this man is waking up and reliving the same day over and over.
2073860	2076980	So you must have heard that part, uh, because it's something, it's like
2076980	2081900	a fun trope that he's literally replaying Groundhog Day every day.
2081900	2083220	And he has no idea why.
2084020	2089340	And when you meet the character, his name is Phil and, you know, played
2089340	2092740	really well by, uh, Marie, right?
2092940	2093420	Yes.
2093500	2093780	Okay.
2093780	2095060	I'm so glad you remembered his name.
2095420	2098700	Uh, and he, you know, played so well by him.
2099060	2107380	And when you meet him, he is this very resentful sort of narcissistic, um,
2107940	2112180	self-aggrandizing type character and he's full of loathing.
2112180	2115940	He, I mean, for everything, for life, for the world, people around him,
2115940	2119460	his colleagues, uh, his job, everything.
2119940	2125500	And so you see him live two particular days before the repeating starts.
2125820	2128700	And when you see the second day that he lives, the one day that he
2128700	2131980	keeps repeating over and over, you realize it's actually a really
2131980	2135180	shitty day that he ends up living where he wakes up.
2135180	2137500	He's, you know, he's here in this town.
2137500	2140940	He's reporting on Groundhog Day and he wakes up.
2140940	2143100	He's at an, at a BNB.
2143220	2144580	It's a cold day.
2144580	2147180	He's rude to the person he meets outside of his room.
2147180	2148100	He mocks him.
2148380	2149340	He goes downstairs.
2149340	2151740	He's rude to the BNB owner.
2151780	2154460	You know, she doesn't know what espresso is and he mocks her for that.
2154740	2159460	He, he walks out, he sees some old man and he's who's asking for money.
2159460	2161220	And he kind of mocks him as well.
2161460	2165340	He tries to avoid this insurance salesman that he runs into who's
2165340	2168260	an old, old student from his own, own school.
2168620	2173460	He ends up getting, walking into a puddle, like a really cold, wet puddle.
2173460	2178980	And like he's just having this terrible day and he comes, he gets to his job,
2178980	2180260	he reports on it again.
2180260	2185100	He's like sarcastically reporting on this job and, and you see him play
2185100	2191540	out this whole day and it's like, what, what entity forced him to relive
2191540	2198100	this day every, like for possibly years, like people estimate that that day he
2198100	2202340	lived for maybe 10 years over and over is what people think.
2202340	2206660	Like it's like thousands and thousands of times he's waking up, but it's,
2206740	2211860	it's that we experience his experience, we experience his life for that one
2211860	2215780	sliver of a day, but you can make that assumption that that's how he was living
2215780	2217940	every single day of his life leading up to that.
2218460	2225740	And the movie, as it evolves, forces him to rethink some things because
2225780	2229860	there's just no out of sheer, you know, lack of choice.
2230340	2234140	And suddenly he switches his perspective from being sort of the super
2234140	2239940	silliest person or even hedonistic person to suddenly he's like, let me
2239940	2244180	see if I can help people because I'm here and I see what they're up to.
2244660	2246540	And suddenly he just starts helping people.
2246900	2248860	He helps the old man that he comes across.
2248860	2254060	He makes sure that he's warm and fed and he goes to, uh, he realizes that one
2254060	2256580	kid across the block like broke his leg.
2256580	2260100	So he, every time, you know, he's about to break his leg every day.
2260100	2262940	He's, he saves him and prevents him from breaking his leg.
2263260	2266780	Unlike some old women get a flat tire and he goes and spends time on that.
2266780	2270380	And that's just him helping people around the town, but he starts
2270380	2274940	learning how to play the piano and he starts learning how to ice sculpt.
2274940	2278300	And like, he starts reading French poetry and there are all these
2278300	2280060	little things he starts engaging in.
2280580	2286580	And then as a, as a result, it actually completely changes his perspective on life.
2286820	2292020	And you, so you see from in the beginning, he lives this terrible, terrible day to
2292020	2296740	suddenly the last day you see, he lives this wondrous day where he goes
2296740	2299660	around reading everybody of their misery.
2300340	2306140	And you realize that nothing has changed.
2306340	2308660	It's not, it's like the day is exactly the same.
2308660	2309940	Life is exactly the same.
2310140	2311820	It's his perspective has changed.
2311820	2313860	His effort into his life has changed.
2314180	2317140	His, how he thinks about other people has changed.
2317140	2321820	And he went from living this resentful, terrible life to actually a
2321820	2327500	very fulfilling, thoughtful life where he's looked at by other people and
2327500	2328740	respected by other people.
2328740	2331660	But whereas before people couldn't give a damn about him.
2332220	2338260	And the, the person who wrote this and the directors, they both said that they
2338260	2343940	receive so many letters from across the globe saying, this is the perfect
2344820	2345820	Buddhist movie.
2345820	2347580	This is the perfect Hindu movie.
2347580	2349620	This is the perfect Jewish movie.
2349620	2353620	This is the perfect, you know, Christian movie, because they were talking about
2353620	2356780	like what lessons that this, this movie was espousing.
2357180	2362420	And the reality is it's actually the perfect, it's perfect universally because
2362420	2369500	it could evade that basic idea that nothing you do in life is under your,
2369860	2374460	sorry, life in general, what happens to you is mostly not under your control.
2375020	2377660	It's what you, how you choose to engage with life.
2377660	2379300	That's really important.
2379540	2383900	And that idea is so universal that people across the globe are writing to him and
2383900	2387860	saying, this really spoke to me, you know, this completely connected with me.
2388100	2388700	And thank you.
2388700	2390580	And, and, and that's the point.
2390620	2392860	That's what makes a good story.
2393340	2395620	And that's what makes a story transcend time.
2396180	2401180	Is if it, if it gets to the core of like actually solving a very important question,
2401180	2406100	which is how do you find a way to live a really good life despite the endless
2406100	2412180	miseries of life, but also why then exploring why resentment is so attractive
2412180	2415940	to it, to a lot of people and everybody goes through that, right?
2416060	2418660	You could be the most optimistic person possible.
2419140	2421860	And I'm, I'm a very optimistic person.
2422260	2425740	But for the last four years, I had a very trying time.
2425740	2428260	There were a lot of things that were happening in my life personally,
2428540	2432580	including health issues and like family issues and all the stuff that it, I
2432580	2437500	could see the door, I could see the door open for me to walk through and become
2437500	2439060	this very resentful person.
2439500	2443180	It's like that, there's always that attraction, but it takes that, it takes
2443180	2447260	work to stay on the optimistic side and that at the end of the day, it just
2447300	2449220	benefits you, you live a better life.
2449580	2452740	If you engage with an optimistic perspective versus a, you know, a
2452740	2455620	resentful, sort of angry one.
2458460	2463020	Well, that's a beautiful analogy and I have so many thoughts.
2464100	2469660	And the saying I say all the time is fate is what you are given.
2470180	2471620	Destiny is what you make of it.
2472700	2473820	And I like that.
2474300	2476860	I think that speaks to two things are true at the same time.
2477740	2482220	You are a product of your environment, but your environment is also a product of you.
2483180	2487740	So when people get drawn towards that victim mindset, it's so attractive
2487740	2490260	because it says, Hey, nothing's your fault.
2490780	2492340	You're just a product of your environment.
2493060	2495540	You didn't pick your genes or your parents or where you're born.
2495940	2497380	So none of this is your fault.
2498220	2500900	And you're like, yes, thank you.
2500900	2502020	That, that is true.
2502140	2503140	And it is true.
2504140	2508540	But what is also true at the same time is your environment is a product of you.
2509420	2515940	So you can enact free will and create the situation that you want to make it.
2515940	2517500	And it all starts within your own mind.
2518260	2522460	And that's kind of why we watch that movie, Groundhog Day in the first place.
2522900	2528180	Cause if it was just him reliving the same day every day and there was no evolution
2528180	2530140	of his mindset, why would we even watch it?
2530980	2534660	That's kind of why we watch movies is to see this hero's journey play out.
2535220	2539500	You know, they start in this resentful, bitter place like Thor or something.
2540340	2541820	And then they have to learn this important lesson.
2541820	2545660	And they come out on the other side, this evolved enlightened being.
2546500	2551660	And I think that's what modern movies are missing so much is the characters don't develop.
2552300	2556780	And in so many of the scenes, nothing is lost and nothing is gained.
2557300	2558620	And you're kind of like sitting there.
2558620	2559900	Why did I even watch this?
2560380	2564420	Cause it's almost like the producer said, we need one more battle scene here.
2564940	2567300	And they just inserted it after the movie was already made.
2568260	2570620	And but, you know, nobody can die and nobody can get hurt.
2570620	2572740	So because it can't impact the later scene.
2573540	2578060	Whereas you think of a good movie, Lord of the Rings, every single battle,
2578060	2582220	every line, every interaction, something is lost and something is gained.
2582740	2585020	So you, you know, everything has weight to it.
2585220	2586780	Everything becomes important.
2587700	2591900	So yeah, that's, that's why we tune into these things to see that evolution.
2592460	2595260	Yeah, yeah, I don't know what you said.
2596140	2598180	Absolutely, absolutely agree with you.
2598180	2600780	There's no, there's, yeah, there's, there are no stakes.
2601140	2606020	And that's what's interesting about Echo is that not only are there no stakes,
2606580	2608620	there are also no morals.
2608700	2613580	You know, she wants, she wants to replace the crime boss that she used to work for.
2613580	2614980	She's this assassin.
2615740	2620940	And she, you know, she realizes that this man kind of betrayed her.
2621180	2624420	So she goes and, you know, shoot some in the face.
2624980	2628980	And now she wants to be, you know, run the ring herself.
2629220	2633420	And there's no recognition that she's gone around killing people.
2633420	2637500	There are no consequences for that, you know, there is no atonement for that.
2637820	2639460	She's not really a hero.
2640380	2645460	Um, she's only so because you're being told that she is so there's no actual
2645460	2647140	morality attached to it.
2647380	2650540	So that, and that's the other thing is that there's no sort of everything sort
2650540	2653860	of murky on that side as well.
2655260	2661100	Well, yeah, that's, that's also a sign of good story writing because the line
2661100	2663020	between good and evil is not very simple.
2663580	2666300	You know, you can't just put all the oppressors on one side and all the
2666300	2667220	oppressed on the other.
2668060	2674140	Um, the famous writer, Alexander Sultan, it's saying his name wrong, but he was
2674140	2676260	the Russian writer that was in a gulag.
2676900	2682100	He famously said that the line between good and evil runs between every human heart.
2683260	2687900	And this was very profound for him to say, because he was at the mercy of these
2687900	2694620	communist soldiers in a gulag and he was able to even see the humanity in them.
2695020	2698660	And he was able to see that people that were right next to him in the camps
2698660	2700500	were also had evil qualities.
2700500	2705020	So it's like everybody, with just a few different tweaks of your
2705020	2709220	circumstances, you could end up being that soldier at the gulag, or you could
2709220	2714020	be a prisoner, you know, it's not clear who's good and who's bad.
2714540	2714980	Right.
2715460	2722500	And I think, um, I think there was a lot of black and white perspective on, on,
2722660	2726700	you know, that could be achieved on, on the war when it came to World War II,
2727220	2730620	because of this like mass imprisonment that happened of people.
2731060	2737100	But everything that's happened geopolitically since is so nuanced that people crave,
2737140	2740700	but people crave that black and white perspective is that they, they don't want
2740700	2742460	it, you know, and I, I do too.
2742460	2744580	I'm not, I'm not pinning it just on other people.
2744580	2748700	I too wish that I could just say that person's evil and, you know, our country
2748700	2749180	is great.
2749180	2754380	And then that way I can just connect with our country's, um, national identity
2754380	2757580	and never have to question it, you know, and I can just feel safe in the
2757580	2761620	national identity, but everything is so murky, but people are often looking for
2761620	2765500	that is that who's the bad guy and I want to be part of the good guys and, and
2765500	2766620	just leave it at that.
2768420	2769100	Very true.
2769100	2772740	I think there was a point in American history where we did think that we were
2772740	2777140	the good guys and we were absolutely sure that probably after World War II, we
2777180	2781340	were patting ourselves on the back, but I think around Vietnam is when we
2781340	2784020	realized actually we might be the bad guys.
2784580	2789500	And I think a lot of that American innocence was ripped away in the 60s.
2790140	2790500	Yes.
2790500	2795220	And I think one of the things that makes me really sad is it was really
2795220	2800460	interesting to watch, uh, Robert, uh, F Kennedy juniors, uh, podcasts.
2800460	2805820	If you haven't watched, um, his talk, by the way, on Joe Rogan and Lex Freedman,
2806060	2807340	just incredible.
2807860	2813540	And he talks a lot about his father and his uncle and their assassinations and,
2814300	2820780	but also how his father and his uncle really helped prevent the war escalation,
2820780	2827180	the Cold War escalation with, uh, with Russia and the whole sort of machine kind
2827180	2833260	of what Eisenhower warned us about the, the complex industry, uh, the military
2833260	2834180	industrial complex.
2834220	2834460	Yes.
2834460	2834820	There you go.
2835540	2839540	Uh, and the obsession with, with another, starting another war, that there was
2839540	2844540	this whole machine trying to manipulate JFK into going to war.
2845180	2852340	Um, and both RFK and JFK sort of coalesced and decided to try to deescalate
2852340	2855020	it by just connecting with Gorbachev directly.
2855740	2861020	And I think RFK ended up writing a letter to Gorbachev and talking about the
2861020	2862860	importance of a future for their children.
2862860	2866100	And Gorbachev being a father himself really connected with that.
2866460	2870540	And RF, RFK Junior tells the story much better than I could do it justice.
2870540	2875820	But what I found really sad about that is that here were two men that were
2875820	2880140	thinking about rather than their legacy, cause they could have thought from the
2880140	2885540	perspective of, you know, being those presidents that are waging into war and,
2885900	2890820	and, you know, recognized as heroes and vanquishing the enemy, so to speak, and
2890820	2892780	just cementing their legacy accordingly.
2892780	2896660	And all they could think about instead was, you know, the people that, you
2896660	2900100	know, millions of Russians will die, millions of Americans will die.
2900620	2904540	And that that's more important than any individual's legacy.
2905340	2910700	And knowing that these two men couldn't be sort of bamboozled into going into
2910700	2916020	war, and there were many attempts made to convince our JFK to send troops to
2916020	2916660	Vietnam.
2916660	2920500	That was actually what RFK Junior talked about, that his, his uncle was
2920700	2924100	really resisting starting a war with Vietnam.
2924780	2927220	And that, that's when the assassination happened.
2927780	2933620	You know, and after that, LBJ, the, the vice president got promoted.
2934140	2936140	And very quickly we went into Vietnam.
2936500	2939100	So you have to wonder sort of around that.
2939100	2943220	I'm not making broad statements there, but you just have to kind of wonder what
2943220	2944580	exactly was going on there.
2944900	2949940	But that's so sad that, you know, these men looked at someone like
2949980	2955540	JFK, who was essentially in that context, the best man among them, who was
2955540	2959260	willing to think about greater good than, than their, than his own selfish
2959260	2959900	desires.
2960660	2966140	And they decided to get together and, and, you know, maybe get him out of the
2966140	2966580	job.
2967260	2970540	So that, and that's what happens, right?
2970540	2973540	You, it takes one man to stand up to something like that, to prevent
2973540	2974460	something bad like that.
2974460	2978180	But that's, that's what moral degradation looks like, is that when good
2978180	2981460	men are unable to, to do anything, to stop it, right?
2981460	2986260	You don't, you have a room of, of like smokey cigars, just driving, you know,
2986260	2990740	very sort of narcissistic, like selfish desires forward versus thinking about
2990740	2992220	the bigger picture of things.
2994340	2994660	Yeah.
2994660	3000340	Well, it seems like we're at a point where the actions of our country,
3000940	3005260	especially abroad globally, don't seem to be in the best interest of the
3005260	3011420	vast majority of citizens in America, it seems to be serving this very small
3011460	3016180	elite group who is like this puppeteer pulling the strings.
3016180	3019660	And we're sitting here like, nobody really wants to go to war.
3019660	3024660	I haven't really met a single person that was just like gung-ho about going to
3024660	3029660	war and it doesn't seem like we're getting much out of it.
3030620	3034940	And, but we're sending all these resources to other countries to keep this going.
3035820	3041340	Yet, when a tragedy happens in America, like in Hawaii, the citizens in Hawaii
3041340	3046060	are kind of left needing help and, you know, they're American citizens.
3046060	3046740	Where's their help?
3047500	3050620	Well, it's not really in the interest of these puppeteers.
3051180	3054620	So, you know, they don't really get much from helping the Hawaiian citizen.
3056100	3056700	Absolutely.
3057460	3061180	And I think this is where the self-governance aspect has really fallen
3061180	3062380	apart in society.
3062380	3066820	Like, if we have to wonder, you know, what exactly is wrong with everything
3066820	3071060	that's going on, it's the fall of self-governance.
3071060	3077940	Because laws and even constitutions, they don't actually implement anything.
3077940	3082620	You know, they set the tone, but it's an agreement that the individuals
3082620	3084380	have to maintain it, right?
3085340	3090540	So, what ends up maintaining a good society is culture.
3091180	3094300	And what ends up maintaining a good culture is self-governance.
3094660	3097460	And how much an individual is willing to do the right thing.
3097980	3100100	And so the culture reinforces that.
3100100	3102300	And then the individual reinforces the culture.
3102860	3109660	And this is, you know, the common Nietzsche line is that we have killed God, right?
3109660	3114540	And, and he predicted all the things that were to come that have happened
3114540	3115740	in the 20th century.
3116460	3120260	And I think that's where we're really languishing as a society is that we
3120260	3122580	don't know what to do with ourselves post-God.
3123260	3129500	And we're seeing, we're very, we're very quick to reject the idea of God.
3130340	3136220	And, and say, oh, that's such an antiquated idea of some man in the sky,
3136260	3138700	kind of like cartoonish perspective on God.
3139180	3143380	But once we've destroyed him, we've actually replaced him with ourselves.
3143820	3147740	And that's a terrible, on a, on a human level, that's actually terrible for us.
3148100	3152980	We, we should not think of ourselves on an individual level as the most sort
3152980	3161580	of the highest being to kind of abide by that what you do alone when no one is
3161580	3166100	looking, your, your selfish mind will say, that's fine.
3166100	3167220	You can do whatever you want.
3167580	3170940	If you have a relationship with a higher power, you would say, no,
3170940	3172420	what's the right thing to do?
3172900	3175460	And that conversation is completely lost.
3175860	3181900	And so people, people kind of, people have become more and more just out
3181900	3182820	for themselves.
3183300	3187540	It's like, I can do whatever I can, even if, you know, even if you look at a
3187540	3193820	very un-successful CEO of a massive company, you know, who's getting fired for
3193820	3197260	a job because his, his company is, you know, laying off people and doing
3197260	3203260	really poorly and yet his, his, um, you know, exit package includes a 50
3203260	3205660	million dollar bonus, right?
3206140	3211940	There should not be a law that says, Hey, unsuccessful CEOs should not be paid.
3212700	3219420	But on an individual level, if you're a moral person who says, what about, what
3219420	3224220	about this is right for me to take money for a job poorly done?
3224940	3229020	You know, and, and there's no, that sort of that cultural reinforcement nor
3229020	3234540	individual reinforcement of doing right by society.
3235100	3236540	And that's where we're at right now.
3236540	3239820	So that's why, so, and then other people look at it and say, well, if other
3239820	3242300	people are going to live for themselves, I'm going to live for myself.
3242780	3246300	So everybody's just sort of bumping into each other, living for themselves,
3246500	3247860	trying to screw each other over.
3248580	3253940	So, so we don't really know what to sort of who to answer to what to do.
3254140	3256100	And everybody's like, just get out of my way.
3256100	3257540	It's like individual first.
3258780	3260820	I don't know if I did the best job at explaining that, but.
3260900	3262380	No, you did an amazing job there.
3262380	3266260	You made me, I'm really glad you brought up that quote from Nietzsche because I've
3266260	3267740	been looking into him a lot lately.
3268100	3271700	And I think that's so relevant when you look at what's happening in, in these
3271700	3277020	like big urban cities where there's a complete lack of common belief system.
3277420	3278620	They've killed God.
3279540	3282100	And so there's nothing holding the people together.
3282980	3287580	And we like to think that we've got science now and we're really enlightened.
3287580	3292140	And we, you know, science has given us all this convenience and comfort, but
3292140	3294380	you can't get your morals from science.
3294620	3297140	You cannot get your principles from just dry facts.
3298140	3301060	And I think that's what religion does.
3301060	3302900	You know, there's good and bad with everything.
3302900	3308940	But one thing that religion does is it tells you a code of morals to live by.
3310180	3315860	And so when somebody falls in front of you and gets hurt, uh, you know,
3315900	3319340	a religious text would say you get down and you help that person.
3320180	3321780	So you know when that happens to do that.
3321820	3325700	But if you don't have that core belief system, somebody falls down in front of
3325700	3328620	you, you can kind of just look at them and say, Oh, that's not my problem.
3328780	3331420	You know, there, if I help them, what would happen to me?
3332380	3338940	You know, like it reminds me of, uh, the good Samaritan idea and being a good neighbor.
3340460	3348860	And, um, yeah, I look around cities now and I see a lot of godless behavior, a lot
3348860	3353540	of lack of morals, people are not, people don't say hello to each other.
3353540	3358380	There's a lot of disconnection and you see it manifest in like people live
3358380	3361980	impulsively, they go towards addiction and prostitution.
3361980	3370020	And then on the other side, you go to a, a temple or a very old ancient religious
3370100	3375620	site and there's pristine gardens and it's quiet and it's been preserved for
3375620	3376500	thousands of years.
3376500	3379860	And you think, okay, maybe there's something to this.
3380140	3385140	And there's a philosophical concept called a Chester's tins fence, Chester tins
3385140	3385540	fence.
3386380	3387060	Have you heard of this?
3387540	3388020	I have.
3388580	3388860	Yeah.
3388860	3389900	Well, just really quick.
3389900	3394020	It's, it's like you come up on a fence and you don't know why it's there.
3394540	3398260	You shouldn't destroy that fence until you know it's purpose.
3398980	3400460	And that's kind of what religion is.
3400460	3403420	Like we're, we're coming up to religion and we're saying, oh, let's just destroy it.
3404180	3407660	But we don't really know what its purpose is fully.
3408180	3410020	And it's been around for thousands of years.
3410740	3413900	And it's, we need to be careful if we're just going to toss it out.
3414500	3419340	I heard a quote, it's, there are two types of fools, those who take religion
3419340	3421820	literally and those who believe it has no value.
3423580	3429780	So I kind of, that, that quote really resonated cause I think you have to have
3429780	3431660	your foot in both realms.
3433300	3433580	Yes.
3433580	3442540	Because on either side, there's a very dogmatic belief, you know, and I'm going to
3442540	3447980	say something, I'm sure it's going to upset a lot of people, but, um, you know,
3448900	3455100	with the decline of religion could have been so massively avoided to specifically
3455100	3460020	Christianity in America, if Christians and Christian leaders were more willing
3460020	3466180	to accept, uh, people in, in, you know, in the gay and lesbian community and say
3466180	3470260	to them, okay, this is, you know, sort of how you, you were born, you were born.
3470980	3475980	And instead of rejecting you and calling you immoral and telling you, you know,
3475980	3481860	you're going to burn in hell, which is to say, no, you know, come into the
3481860	3489260	community, be who you are, but live morally, settle down with a person, adopt
3489260	3496580	a child or, you know, have a child by, by some other, you know, person, but live
3496580	3498500	morally and live a nice fulfilling life.
3498660	3499900	Come, come be a Christian.
3499900	3504260	Here's your path to being Christian, you know, and, and I know a lot of people
3504260	3507740	that makes a lot of Christians unhappy, that idea, because they say, well, the
3507740	3509100	Bible says this X, Y, and Z.
3509420	3511780	There are a lot of things by both the Bible says that people don't want to
3511780	3515100	live by people kind of, it's like what you're saying is like, you take it to
3515100	3516140	literally, right?
3516380	3518300	It's like the Bible also has its own limitations.
3518300	3519620	It was written at certain times.
3519940	3524700	And so there should be a willingness to understand when something is, is out of
3524700	3528660	fashion, but can be evolved to meet modern requirements.
3528660	3534220	And what happened instead, so they rejected this, this huge community and
3534220	3539540	told them that you are, no matter what your immoral, no matter what, and
3539540	3542900	completely turned them away, ostracized them completely.
3543900	3549580	And so they said, okay, well, if I'm immoral anyway, why should I live a
3549580	3550260	normal life?
3551060	3554020	You know, why should I try to engage with any of your rules?
3555060	3558340	And they completely, they were completely cast out into the wild.
3558900	3562380	And I think that's so damaging for society, because we, at some point, we
3562380	3565580	had to reconcile with that fact is that some people are gay, some people are
3565580	3567340	lesbian, you have to reconcile with that fact.
3568220	3572020	And, and that's the thing is that religion should, should endeavor to be at
3572020	3577020	the best version of people rather than this overly solidified aspect.
3577020	3580420	And same with, you know, I'm, I'm not Christian, I'm, I'm Hindu.
3580660	3581780	It's the same with Hinduism too.
3581780	3585580	Hinduism, you know, has made many attempts to reject a lot of things.
3585580	3587540	And, oh, women should do this.
3587540	3590700	And women should jump in the pyre of their dying husband.
3590740	3593860	You know, there, there are a lot of limiting things that religion do.
3593860	3594980	They have to evolve.
3595620	3600100	And I think that's where we're kind of stuck is like the, you know, like
3600140	3605460	all these old fashioned ideas that have persisted for thousands of years.
3605500	3606940	You know, why is marriage good?
3606940	3611180	All of these things, they're being upended today because everybody's like
3611260	3612620	willing to question everything.
3613340	3614700	Let's question everything.
3615380	3618140	And the problem is that a lot of people don't know how to defend it.
3618660	3622180	If, you know, it's like kind of like, if a child keeps asking you, why, why, why,
3622180	3624380	why, why, why this, why that, why do I have to eat this?
3624380	3625260	Why do I have to do that?
3625500	3627740	And then the parent just goes eventually because I said so.
3628300	3631740	You know, and, and that's sort of what society was trying to do is like, well,
3631740	3633380	you, why, why should I get married?
3634220	3634980	Everybody does it.
3635260	3635820	Just do it.
3636700	3642180	And so that those, I think we became too, we came, we, at a point that we're
3642180	3643300	willing to question everything.
3643300	3644740	We needed better answers.
3645700	3650820	And I think that's what your channel and, you know, hopefully my channel, we're
3650820	3655620	trying to do is we're trying to answer these questions of, of sort of the old
3655620	3660340	fashioned values, what value do they have to the individual today?
3660340	3666580	Because they persisted not because it's some nefarious plot to control the individual.
3666580	3671540	They persisted because they're actually good for the individual and understanding
3671540	3674140	that so that people can understand why is marriage so good?
3674140	3675620	Why is monogamy so good?
3676020	3680900	You know, there's that, that whole idea of, no, you know, human beings are meant
3680900	3685660	to be meant, meant to be, uh, you know, polygamous and that selling monogamy,
3685660	3689860	that's a very Judeo-Christian old fashioned way of controlling people, you
3689860	3691180	know, that whole thing.
3691540	3695220	And when that's not true at all, monogamy is actually so good for individuals
3695220	3696940	and it's so good for children.
3697580	3703020	And, and so understanding all of that and explaining all of that is, I think
3703020	3710380	that's the way we move forward is, um, is a non, is without relying on, well,
3710380	3711780	because God said so.
3712540	3713540	That's why you have to do it.
3713620	3719460	Instead, actually giving a thoughtful action with a thoughtful answer without
3719460	3725220	having to kind of jump it up to the big man in the sky, uh, as, as, as to rely
3725220	3726220	on his authority.
3727860	3730060	Yeah, that's, that was beautifully put.
3730260	3737620	And I've come around to see that monogamy is the best long-term strategy by
3737620	3742660	far for raising families, for long-term happiness, for living life.
3742700	3745780	And it's the simplest, for sure.
3748300	3752460	But I can see when you're young, it's hard to see that because you want to
3752460	3753460	experience everything.
3754340	3760380	And you, you know, it's like if you're a prisoner in a cell, I'm like literally
3760380	3765340	drawing this image right now, there's a prisoner in a cell and he can reach
3765340	3772380	for the keys to open the cell or he can reach for some food and get some food.
3773180	3776260	And, you know, the prisoners usually going to reach for the food.
3776700	3780340	Well, the image shows him reaching for the food because it's like we want to
3780340	3784060	reach for that, that instant gratification, that pleasure rather than
3784900	3786620	seeing, okay, what's good for the long-term.
3787900	3788260	Yeah.
3788900	3791260	Yeah, you're so, that's, you're absolutely right.
3791540	3795020	And I think as when you're young, you know, you're impetuous enough, but that's
3795020	3797180	also important to kind of explore.
3798020	3800180	Um, you don't know what you want.
3800180	3801900	You're not crystallized yet.
3802220	3807340	It's good to have a good dating history to try to see like, you know, what kind
3807340	3808740	of person's going to gel with you.
3808740	3813460	I, I'm very, uh, opposed to the idea of people getting married super young.
3813460	3814900	I'm very opposed to that idea.
3814900	3818420	I know that's, uh, a lot of people feel like that's the, the good approach
3818420	3819820	to marriage longevity.
3819820	3825060	I think, I think instead in those cases, you can sometimes hit the jackpot and
3825060	3828380	other times, you know, you were kind of 45 and you wake up and you, you know,
3828380	3831420	have to upend your whole life to say, I have to get out of this relationship.
3831780	3833620	Which is very destructive, you know, divorce.
3833620	3837340	I think honestly, hell and divorce are pretty close together.
3837460	3839820	The ideas of those two, two experiences.
3840340	3845580	And I think it's good to experience and then at some point to say, okay, now
3845580	3849540	to move forward and kind of evolve into who I'm going to be for the, for the
3849540	3852020	long haul is to, is to settle down with the person.
3853940	3854740	Yeah, I agree.
3854940	3861500	All said, um, yeah, there's a couple of other things I wanted to talk to you about.
3862060	3867300	I think now would be a good time to talk about what is healthy masculinity.
3867460	3869380	And how the femininity look like.
3871020	3873060	You said femininity without struggling.
3873100	3874260	I always struggle with that.
3874860	3875980	That's like femininity.
3876780	3876980	Yeah.
3876980	3878900	I think I even wrote it with just like, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
3880860	3881700	Just endless.
3882580	3882940	Yeah.
3883660	3889220	Um, yeah, I, uh, I think so this is what's really interesting, right?
3889220	3894860	Because, um, with the way people think today, it's that if you, if you give a
3894860	3898940	proper definition to something people are like well they'll think about the
3898940	3903700	exceptions to that right so I want to talk about this one on a general level
3903700	3907140	because it's like that's one thing that's gone out of style is pointing out
3907140	3911060	that what are men like and what are women like it's like well some men can be
3911060	3915220	like that and some women it can be like that it's like yeah with eight billion
3915220	3919060	people there are always exceptions to everything but there's a general ideas of
3919060	3924260	and there are a lot of similarities between most men and a lot of similarities
3924260	3928940	between most women but there are always exceptions I think positive feminine
3928940	3937660	positive masculinity to me means a person that is is oriented towards
3937660	3944780	protection you know who's strong you know because men are are born to be
3944780	3949620	strong to be physically strong and I think psychologically for men engaging
3949620	3955100	with physical strength is actually really good for them and and I think that
3955100	3960620	trend of modern life that doesn't really reward physical strength is not it's
3960620	3966660	not it that's not a good thing for men I and I think encouraging men to be strong
3966660	3975220	but also dangerous and capable of being dangerous but then knowing how to be
3975220	3982180	gentle like that right balance of of dangerous and gentle which is why you
3982180	3988060	know martial arts is such an interesting endeavor for men is because they
3988060	3991540	learned that discipline of how to be really really strong but how to apply
3991540	3998340	that that strength in the right frame of mind and part of that I think is is
3998340	4003500	stoicism which is so I feel like it's such a misunderstood idea because people
4003540	4010540	often look at stoicism like saying oh if you're stoic you reject all emotion you
4010540	4014780	know you you suppress all of your emotion you don't feel anything you don't
4014780	4019780	have space to feel and I think that's completely wrong the the tenant sorry
4019780	4025460	about the sound the motorcycle sound but the tenant tenants of stoicism is to
4025460	4030500	say one of those is what you and I were talking about earlier that you can't
4030500	4034180	control what's going to happen to you you can't control what the world is
4034180	4037940	going to be like what you can control is how you react to it and whether or not
4037940	4044780	you allow your circumstances to destabilize your mind and so the
4044780	4052260	antithesis to stoicism is someone walking into a bar and the barman calls
4052420	4060620	you ma'am but you identify as as not a ma'am and you get angry and you start
4060620	4064420	throwing a fit and then you go online and start crying and and making a video
4064420	4068940	complaining about how much that hurt to hear that that's the antithesis of
4068940	4075820	stoicism and you have allowed someone else's actions to make you deeply and
4075820	4081460	happy and completely completely upend you and that's the point is that stoicism
4081460	4085380	says that are you the master of your emotions or the are the emotions the
4085380	4089820	master of you and I think that's a really important part of what it means to be
4089820	4096220	a man because men often have to do go out and do sort of the harder physically
4096220	4102260	harder things so a mastery of your emotions is really important versus let's
4102260	4107740	say for a woman which you know people might take take offense at that but the
4107740	4112460	reason it's so important with men is because men wield more dangerous physical
4112460	4118180	power so balance of mind is really important if a man loses his cool he can
4118180	4122660	cause a lot of damage to the people around him whereas a woman might just
4122660	4126820	say things right but a man could actually like really hurt some people
4126820	4131420	around him and so that's why I think the stoicism aspect is so important to
4131500	4138940	masculinity and that his orientation his like focus is about protecting that
4138940	4142980	should be about protecting the people around him whether that's his you know
4142980	4148540	wife and mother and and father and daughter and son and that's what's
4148540	4152140	really interesting one of the things I was looking into was the statistics up
4152140	4159020	around fatherlessness and there's so much negative impact of the fatherlessness
4159020	4163820	issue in our society but one of the one of the really shocking ones was that a
4163820	4168700	daughter in a fatherless home is nine hundred percent more likely to be
4168700	4174740	assaulted and and you know my my friend and I were talking about some some
4174740	4178660	random stuff we were talking and one of the things she pointed out she was like
4178660	4183060	you know when we were looking at all these Epstein things all these flight
4183060	4186700	logs and all this stuff going on she said her father said the first thing
4186980	4193380	her father said was where are the fathers of all those daughters like why are
4193380	4197420	those daughters you know all those little young girls why are they in those
4197420	4203100	situations and that's the thing is like you need a strong man to protect young
4203100	4210100	girls from other nefarious men you need a strong man paying attention to that so
4210100	4215980	I think that whole aspect of protection and children who come from homes where
4215980	4225460	they feel protected is so crucial and I think for young men having a man model
4225460	4230900	for them the importance of positive masculinity is so important because for
4230900	4236860	young men they don't learn from moms just like young girls don't learn
4236860	4241900	femininity from dads you know you need it to be modeled for you to understand
4241940	4245620	and so that's why then you know it's important to have a coach or a teacher
4245620	4249620	or someone some male influence positive male influence to tell you what's right
4249620	4255820	but also to keep you in check young boys you know test the boundaries of life and
4255820	4259540	they need someone that can challenge them a mother can't challenge them after
4259540	4264100	a certain age but a father can forever if he's if he's taking his
4264100	4268780	responsibility seriously and tell and that's one that was a really good point
4268780	4272420	that Larry Elder had made when he went on the breakfast breakfast club a couple
4272420	4275860	months ago he said you know I was never scared of the police what the police might
4275860	4279820	do to me I was scared of what my father would do to me if I if I misbehaved and
4279820	4283700	when you see the amount of youth out there you know you were mentioning kind
4283700	4287940	of the city streets issues you see a lot of youth out there that's not afraid of
4287940	4291780	the police they're not afraid of anybody and it's because the first person
4291780	4295180	they need to be afraid of was their father as the primary discipline
4295860	4301500	so I think all of those aspects are really important about that go into
4301500	4305660	masculinity that end up actually really holding society together that are really
4305660	4311900	crucial and then should I move on to femininity or do you want to pause here
4311900	4318980	that was really beautifully said and it's the masculinity issue is it has so
4318980	4325980	many sides to it yes and and you were saying that a lot of men find used to
4325980	4329860	find their place in the world through physical means you know they pride
4329860	4335900	themselves on being physically strong and for thousands of years that brought
4335900	4339700	you a lot of value into the world or that that was your way of adding value to
4339700	4343940	the world was your strength and now we're living in this modern world where
4344420	4350180	your physical strength and endurance and just like your your masculine power isn't
4350180	4354660	isn't quite as useful and so I think a lot of people are turning to like things
4354660	4359420	like martial arts as an outlet for that but still it's not like you're going to
4359420	4364740	be on the front lines doing jujitsu to defend your country right it's it's a
4364740	4372260	simulation of of an ancient art but there are less and less jobs that require
4372340	4380740	that masculine physical strength so I think that an important transition for
4380740	4389300	men is to be there as spiritual protectors now yes yes it's it's just as
4389300	4395420	important as physical protection and yeah if you abandon your children they're
4395420	4400020	not going to have that spiritual protection or encouragement or guidance
4400020	4405300	and yeah it it makes sense some some of those statistics that you just said
4405300	4409780	that yeah without that spiritual protection you could end up in some
4409780	4414220	bad situations it's a sad situation especially in San Francisco when you
4414220	4420980	walk down any street and you see these people who are engaged in drug abuse
4421540	4427140	and they're keeled over and I look at them sometimes and I feel like I mean I
4427140	4431420	know this might make it sound like I'm trivializing the situation but I often
4431420	4435540	think in movies I like make connections to certain scenes and like the
4435540	4439900	emotional resonance of things kind of help stabilize accordingly to me but I
4439900	4444900	thought of them and thought about Gollum and how you know one of the things he
4444900	4451020	says is that I forgot the feel of of the wind I forgot the taste of food I
4451020	4455860	forgot my own name and that's what it seems like to me is that they're
4455860	4461420	forgotten that they're human beings and they're willing to actually let
4461420	4470700	themselves be in this very sort of disjointed you know non-human state and
4471380	4477500	a lot of that comes from feelings of abandonment of you know the statistics
4477500	4484540	around again youths that end up you know engaged in drug abuse and running away
4484540	4491180	from home and becoming homeless are pretty heavily tied to fatherless homes
4491180	4497820	pretty heavily it's like 90% of youths that are on the street are are come from
4498180	4504540	fatherless homes and the thing is that your mother can't abandon you a mother
4504540	4509460	might that's very rare because mothers have the biological attachment we have
4509460	4514540	the benefit of that first of all child is like literally part of your body and
4514540	4520620	but there are also a lot of hormones and things that engage in bonding that are
4520620	4525860	very very strong so it's it's almost like a given that a mother is going to be
4525860	4530300	there till the day you die you know well that's a weird way to say it when you
4530300	4533840	mothers rarely see their children die what am I saying I understand what you're
4533840	4539500	saying you understand what I'm saying I'm losing my mind clearly mothers are
4539500	4545060	there through the long haul like you said but a father has a choice whether or
4545060	4550220	not to engage with his children and he can choose to walk away and when a father
4550220	4555620	chooses to walk away it actually creates such a fracture for children a
4555620	4560660	feeling of abandonment a feeling that they weren't good enough and that's a
4560660	4564340	such a common thing by the way if you see you know in any TV show there's so
4564340	4569420	many instances of characters that the father wasn't in the picture and they
4569420	4574180	have all these abandonment issues as a result you know Barney from how I met
4574180	4578340	your mother is an example of that you know Schmidt from New Girl is an example
4578380	4581860	of that it means very common and Barney when he comes across his father and
4581860	4587180	finds out that he actually has this family now and has a kid who he named
4587180	4592260	after himself you know he Barney feels so he feels so terrible he was like why
4592260	4598020	was wasn't I enough for you to do that for you to be there for me and so this
4598020	4602300	whole idea that you know it's totally fine if a child is raised by single
4602300	4604980	mothers and the reason people say that is because they don't want to hurt the
4604980	4608220	feelings of single mothers they're doing a very hard job but it's actually
4608220	4613740	so massive it's such a massive problem and and then you see them then on the
4613740	4619860	streets and you can understand why one of the you know one half of a very
4619860	4623780	important partnership that needed to make them feel like they were good enough
4623780	4628260	was missing from their lives and and they didn't know how to they don't know
4628260	4632620	how to manage life without that for a lot of people you know that's the that's
4632740	4639580	unfortunate occurrence without a father one of my most popular videos is how
4639580	4646540	childhood trauma leads to addiction by dr. Gabor mate and yeah essentially his
4646540	4651700	his theory boils down to from a young age from the moment we're born
4651700	4657140	attachment is our number one need if we don't stay attached to adults will die
4658060	4664140	so we hold that over every other value we need to stay attached to adults and we
4664140	4669300	will suppress our authenticity to stay attached and he says anytime you
4669300	4674420	suppress your authenticity is when you create trauma and the more you express
4674420	4678820	your authenticity the greater you will chase that feeling of attachment later
4678820	4684140	in life and things like heroin I've never done it but apparently it provides
4684260	4690460	that exact feeling almost that exact chemical concoction in the brain of
4690460	4695780	that attachment feeling so you see some of these addicts living in what looks
4695780	4702980	like hell on earth but they inject this drug and for however long they are
4702980	4706180	feeling like they're bathed in love they're finally getting that hug from
4706180	4712220	their parent that they've been longing for forever so that theory seemed to
4712620	4719460	really sad yeah really really sad so yeah you know there's there's two ways
4719460	4723100	to look at these people on the street you know a lot a lot of people see them
4723100	4727780	as a problem to be solved but yeah you can also look at them as they are just
4727780	4732460	the products of this environment that they didn't choose and you know if I
4732460	4738540	was in that situation would I be the same maybe you know probably right yeah yeah
4738580	4743700	I mean in that way you know you have to really count blessings right that are
4743700	4748300	given to us and and that have helped prevent us from falling down that kind
4748300	4754260	of path but to say oh I would never do that right you know but but to say like
4754260	4758380	no there there are situations that you might do that you know or I might do
4758380	4764140	that so I feel yeah I feel really sad for those people because it is such a
4764260	4769820	misunderstood problem but it's also one that there's no sort of there's no
4769820	4775660	adequate push to resolve at the moment unfortunately absolutely there's a
4775660	4781820	YouTube channel called Channel 5 with Andrew Callahan I think and he just did
4781820	4788620	a really good documentary about San Francisco and all the car break-ins I
4788620	4793780	used to live there my car got broken into six times I lived there so this
4794380	4798820	particular did they break the tiny window or did they do other things just
4798820	4803020	curious they pretty much broke every window okay including the front windshield
4803020	4810940	at one point so yeah it's very thorough experience them all so when I saw this
4810940	4814860	topic I clicked on the video with a lot of emotion like yeah we got to get rid
4814860	4820740	of these these people they're like parasites that are going around causing
4820860	4826940	chaos with no ramifications they need to be stopped and he did such a great job
4826940	4830780	reporting he finally meets one of these guys that breaks into the cars and he
4830780	4835260	follows him around for an entire day and gets to know him really well and by the
4835260	4839380	end I'm feeling really bad for this guy like he has a kid that he hasn't seen
4839380	4843620	and he wants to see him and he's he's got no options he's hooked on these
4843620	4849820	fentanyl and he's been abandoned kind of kind of like the typical tragic story
4850100	4856140	and by the end you're like my god like I could have been this guy if I was in
4856140	4862860	that situation you know you can't it's hard to judge at that point hmm wow okay
4862860	4868740	I definitely need to watch that because you know I I can have empathy and then
4868740	4872940	there are moments of frustration where I kind of find myself completely outside
4872940	4879700	of that and very angry and I think I need to recalibrate a little bit you
4879700	4887580	know yeah there's an idea that we don't have any free will that I don't fully
4887580	4892580	agree with but it there's a lot of logic to it that you know we are products of
4892580	4896420	our environment yeah all these variables go into everything is cause and effect
4896420	4901060	right and I think the value in in seeing that argument though is that you don't
4901060	4906420	hold blame on people as much as you would if you didn't know that idea because
4906700	4913060	when you see somebody committed atrocity you can kind of see alright at one
4913060	4917500	at one point this person was a baby and they just got fumbled around in the
4917500	4922300	wrong way and you you don't you don't hold that resentment in your heart
4922300	4927660	towards them yeah if you know that idea yeah of course there are lines that you
4927660	4930900	have to set and there are boundaries that have to be drawn so you can't just be
4930900	4935980	indifferent on everything right but I think it's helpful to have that idea in
4935980	4940140	your mind as well yeah you you know that completely makes sense because it's not
4940140	4944980	like they got they have no free will but there is and they need to have some
4944980	4950220	level of positive influence to at least help them see what's a good path for
4950220	4953820	them of how they can create a better life but if they never get that
4953820	4957900	opportunity how could they see it's not like we're born with any kind of
4957900	4964420	inherent understanding of good we we have we have some level of where we can
4964420	4968900	engage oh this is a good thing to do and this is not but it takes a lot of
4968900	4974740	thought and and sort of exploration to get to that it's not kind of built in
4974740	4979700	absolutely yeah well I guess we should probably round this segment out with the
4979700	4989340	feminine femininity side yes so let's do it positive femininity look like so I
4989500	4994580	think femininity is not about physical strength that's not to say that some
4994580	4998380	women aren't physically strong and if that's what they are interested in I
4998380	5006740	think femininity is about a different sort of emotional and mental strength it
5006740	5019100	takes a lot to first of all walk around as as a sort of a weaker weaker part of
5019100	5027660	society in a lot of ways if I'm just going about my day I have to make sure
5027660	5032820	I'm thinking about where I might be putting myself at risk and I have I
5032820	5036100	have responsibility to myself and my loved ones to make sure that I don't
5036140	5040740	put myself in situations where I'm at risk and in those cases it's it is this
5040740	5049300	weird relationship that every woman has with men where a man at on an empty
5049300	5053580	street dark street could be your perpetrator or your savior it could be
5053580	5057740	either you know you don't know you might either be really happy to see him or
5057740	5064820	really sad to see him and I think that one of those important aspects of being
5065060	5069540	a woman is to be very responsible and I mean and this is one of those things
5069540	5073740	that women modern women really hate this idea but there's a reason why women
5073740	5080620	mature faster is because we first of all puberty for women it means we are
5080620	5085660	inundated with a lot of negative emotion which I recall that moment and
5085660	5091340	suddenly I went from being a very happy child to very sad all the time and you
5091340	5096420	know we had our we have our initiation into womanhood that men don't have you
5096420	5101060	know we we know when we're suddenly women we have we actually have a very
5101060	5107780	strong bookend for that or sorry like I guess not a bookend but transition for
5107780	5113980	that and that means suddenly you're looked at differently you have to behave
5113980	5117420	differently you have to you have to be a lot more thoughtful and how you're
5117420	5124940	presenting yourself to the world and I think part of that is also then how you
5124940	5130860	engage with men and how you allow men to look at you this is something I feel
5130860	5137140	very strongly about but I think about it's very important for positive
5137140	5142900	femininity to be about imposing lines on with how like boundaries around how
5142900	5151260	men engage with you and and converse with you relate with you and you know
5151260	5153940	this was something that when I was growing up it was a good thing I'd
5153940	5159380	grown up on books like Pride and Prejudice and you know Emily Bronte's
5159380	5163420	books like I had I grew up on kind of very old-fashioned perspectives on on
5163420	5168460	the feminine and when I got to college and every man thought that it was
5168460	5174940	perfectly acceptable to get my affection or my time by just sending me a
5174940	5185380	you-up text was so angering that that's what passed as as modern romance and I
5185380	5191340	found it so deeply offensive that that it was perfectly acceptable that a man
5191340	5196340	could look at me like a commodity that he could get at the end of the night just
5196340	5199620	by sent you know either buying me a drink or sending me something like that
5199620	5209100	and I think forget about what anybody thinks on an individual level as a woman
5209100	5214580	you will live a much better life if you have a strong control on how people how
5214580	5221580	people how much people sexualize and commodify you and you know and this is
5221580	5225380	something I could talk about honestly endlessly but the the the biggest
5225380	5231860	difference the biggest impact is kind of how how if if you set a boundary on how
5231860	5236180	other people treat you you also end up really ensuring that you you treat
5236180	5241820	yourself properly that you respect yourself it's really easy again coming
5241820	5246300	back to that like people kind of rushing to whatever is easy today it's a
5246300	5251560	really easy for me to monetize myself on my body I could start an only fans to
5251560	5255200	tomorrow I have a YouTube channel I could tell them hey I'm starting an only
5255200	5260280	fans and I could be making money I mean I'm like whatever looking whatever but I
5260280	5264040	could do that because it's really easy for a woman to make money by commodifying
5264040	5268600	herself but does that mean that you're gonna be endlessly happy is that in
5268600	5272440	respect yourself and have healthy relationships with opposite sex or your
5272440	5276400	children or your parents absolutely not it's because you are telling someone
5276400	5280080	else that they can buy your body and that's how that's how the world is gonna
5280080	5287040	treat you they're gonna treat your body like a commodity so I think that sort of
5287040	5292160	conservative approach to how you let the world talk to you is really really
5292160	5298240	healthy for on an individual level for a woman and then the other aspect of it is
5298240	5303560	like what's your responsibility to the opposite sex let's say your husband or
5303560	5307040	your part you know your your male partner specifically we're talking about men
5307040	5314080	and women here I think men unfortunately don't have a lot of opportunity to have
5314080	5319800	an outlet for their emotion I think partly societal and partly I think it's
5319800	5329800	just how men sort of prefer to be and I think being that sort of sort of creating
5329800	5336640	that space for your husband or your boyfriend or whoever to have an outlet
5336640	5342600	and talk to you and share with you sort of all of their insecurities and fears
5342600	5347480	and and giving them that opportunity to do so without having ramifications or
5347480	5351320	like you know reputation issues or punishing them is really important
5351320	5355040	because we women are really good at that and this is something I didn't really
5355040	5359920	realize until until I was married so I you know I'm I have a brother but I
5359920	5365440	honestly didn't understand this until I got married was that you know my husband
5365440	5370200	talks to his father about his issues or he talks to me but that's but that's it
5370200	5376440	I talked to my husband I talked to my dad I talked to my mom I talked to my
5376440	5379920	brother I talked to my sister-in-law I talked to my friend I for talked to my
5379920	5384240	other friend I talked to my other friend I have endless sources of places where I
5384240	5387560	actually have an outlet for my emotions and my issues and all of that and
5387560	5392440	everybody you know receives it and says go go ahead you cry you feel it all of
5392440	5396160	that and I noticed that with my husband he he doesn't have a lot of those like
5396160	5400800	he's not he's not even willing to do that but it's like he actually doesn't
5400800	5405840	have adequate outlets for that and that's one one of those aspects I think is
5405840	5409560	really important is that if men are going to be those like spiritual
5409560	5412760	protectors like you were talking about and I love that idea that concept of
5412760	5417520	spiritual protective it's so important that they also need to have a place where
5417520	5424120	they can be weak and have an outlet for that emotion and I think that's really
5424120	5430040	important for women to do that and you know modern women hate it being told
5430040	5434160	like we need to do this for our husbands like it's like that's like you know
5434160	5439320	this absolutely loads some idea to say to a woman these days but just like men
5439320	5444960	oh women things and for us to say oh husband should endeavor to do this for
5444960	5447720	his wife that's a good thing we say oh that's a good thing yes husbands should
5447720	5451360	do things for their wives but that's the same thing is that you know we women
5451360	5456080	have responsibilities as well and I think our emotional intelligence is our
5456080	5460480	greatest strength our ability to to comfort to care for I mean that we
5460480	5464520	should not we should not reject those ideas that's that's our greatest strength
5464520	5471320	the whole the whole foundation of family is built on a woman that's willing to
5471320	5478240	build a good family but the protection and safety and ultimate success of the
5478240	5482800	family is based on a husband and his willingness to protect his family and I
5482800	5489720	think in that way is where you partner up and create this really strong connection
5489720	5497880	between the best of both sexes for you know ultimate success I was beautifully
5497920	5504680	put you keep giving me a lot to think about and I'm taking notes here I did a
5504680	5511760	video this summer to try to clarify sex and gender it was a big video and I
5511760	5518000	knew it would be risky to make but we I worked with Heather Hying and Brett
5518000	5523680	Weinstein oh what what I mean what a great partnership there so they look at
5523680	5529480	this entire issue from a evolutionary biology lens and it was really
5529480	5534000	interesting to just look at it through that lens but when you take it down to
5534000	5540560	like the sperm and the egg you have thousands and thousands of sperm
5540560	5545600	competing competing for that one egg and that translates to our behavior in the
5545600	5549960	real world men typically are more focused on what happens before
5550120	5554520	reproduction whereas women are more focused on what happens after reproduction
5554520	5559400	because they have to take care of the child whereas men so you typically see
5559400	5565360	men competing a lot more and they're fighting with with each other for a
5565360	5572320	mate and it is the woman's job to be a filter and to be selective and I think
5572320	5577800	that manifests in what we value in men and women like we it's really seen as
5577840	5584440	valuable for a man to be able to provide because that sets him competitively that
5584440	5589080	sets him out from the herd and it also shows that he could be an asset after
5589080	5594800	the child is born he can create a stable environment for that child down the
5594800	5604240	road whereas what men value in women is fertility but also a big thing that you
5604240	5609800	were speaking on that often gets overlooked is the ability to be selective
5609800	5616440	the ability to be that filter which is the ability to set boundaries and say
5616440	5623680	no and so if a woman shows that she's able to say no her value goes way up in
5623680	5631080	the eyes of men and yes that that only fans life is very alluring it's right
5631120	5637320	there it's that instant gratification and it's it can be hard to say no to it but
5637320	5644640	the second you do that you completely lose that filter that value and you can
5644640	5650040	never get it back yeah which is something you know feminism is trying to
5650040	5654480	change that so fourth wave feminism I think we're evolving past fourth wave and
5654480	5659120	into fifth wave I don't know when they'll make that declaration but I think
5659120	5664840	you know fourth wave was all about sort of DV a DEI and and actual like I think
5664840	5671360	at fourth wave they've achieved a lot of success by actually infiltrating HR
5671360	5676840	departments and writer rooms and they you know that they've gotten some level
5676840	5681480	of critical critical mass but fifth wave if we could make that argument that
5681480	5688440	we're entering that is might I lose my train of thought fifth wave like a fifth
5688440	5694520	wave do we even have women anymore or is that concept just become relative yeah
5694520	5700360	no that I think so the whole breakdown of the definition of woman really happened
5700360	5706560	at the third wave but we didn't hear about it until the fourth wave because
5706560	5712040	the the whole third wave was based on intersectionality as well as this book
5712040	5717040	that Judith Butler I always find it hard to say her name but Judith Butler who is
5717040	5721480	it who is a professor at UC Berkeley wrote this book called gender trouble
5721480	5728680	where she sort of brought to popularity the concept of gender roles you know
5728680	5733200	being something that you could jump between sorry gender and sex being
5733200	5738480	something you could jump between that it could and you know she hers she
5738480	5744320	identified as non-binary so prefers to go by a day so it really got
5744320	5748000	introduced then but what was the thing you said sorry what was the last thing
5748000	5753040	you had said right before was it about fifth wave and how we're just gonna get
5753040	5756400	so relative that we're gonna lose the definitions of everything but right
5756400	5761080	before that what was like the point I was talking about women are the filter
5761360	5766880	oh and only fans yes okay so now I cut it sorry that fifth wave is gonna is
5766880	5772720	really gonna be about finalizing this concept that sex work is just regular
5772720	5780040	work and that commodifying of the of the body is totally fine and I think part
5780040	5786160	of that is already in motion there's a lot of push for the destigmatization of
5786240	5791480	adult industry work because women are the ones you know they say that suffer
5791480	5795480	the consequences for that for good reasons as you've explained and I
5795480	5799560	completely agree with all of those which is that it's you know a filtration
5799560	5805480	system for a woman is far more important than for a man and that's the big push
5805480	5810400	that women are suffering for having to engage with the adult industry because
5810400	5815880	you know due to limited economic issue you know resources that a woman might
5815880	5819440	turn to something like only fans and then she's ostracized for the rest of her
5819440	5824160	life and that should not be allowed why is it that men are not and and when men
5824160	5828640	are the main consumers of something like that why is that not why is that not
5828640	5833320	forgiven for women or even not even considered for women and the other thing
5833320	5842240	that's going to happen is going to be the overhauling of woman you know that
5842240	5847080	idea of woman bearing children I think that's going to be the next push is
5847080	5851320	going to be that oh well we should just be relying on science to bear children
5851320	5857320	and that even a surrogate is totally fine that's going to be the next push
5857320	5863440	policy-wise which in America is a lot more lenient but in other countries it's
5863440	5868360	considered a pretty pretty difficult thing to accept because what you're doing
5868360	5873160	through surrogacy and this is something Louise Perry talks a lot about that she
5873160	5876840	talks about how you know you're intentionally breaking a very important
5876840	5880720	bond between mother and child and I'm sure Gabor Maté would have a lot to say
5880720	5885040	about that as well because you know that that there's a lot of trauma attached to
5885080	5892360	that because you know the baby the first heartbeat that he or she hears is the
5892360	5895800	mother's heartbeat the smell I mean the baby doesn't even for the first couple
5895800	5899760	for a long time doesn't even feel like they're apart from the mother right even
5899760	5903000	after being born they feel like the mother's body is their body it's like a
5903000	5907360	very deep connection that you intentionally break through surrogacy so
5907360	5913000	I think there's a lot of moral questions that people are going to try to raise
5913040	5917200	that you know the next wave of feminism is going to say no well you know it's
5917200	5922200	totally fine to farm out someone some other woman's body for for my
5922200	5925720	particular needs or your particular needs that should be totally okay and
5925720	5929080	consider a regular transaction and that's that's really what is we're
5929080	5933720	looking at is that general commodification of the female body and
5933720	5940840	and and that being totally okay well yeah if we're gonna take it to the future
5940880	5946680	trajectory yeah I think we're not that far away from AI porn and things like
5946680	5956160	that so yeah it'll yeah the the the competition may be with these AI porn
5956160	5960560	bots and that's gonna be hard to compete with because those things are gonna
5960560	5966000	have no taboos but those things will be able to go to the wildest fantasy and
5966000	5972120	beyond yeah and I don't think any human would be able to compete with that so
5972120	5977560	perhaps we're gonna go so full cycle we're gonna go all the way around or you
5977560	5981840	know every sex work is gonna be incentivized and then it's gonna be just
5981840	5986080	like we can't compete with these AI bots let's just go back to having like
5986080	5994500	peaceful civil romance yeah I'm being optimistic maybe it'll just get so
5994540	6000780	chaotic that I'm done with this I'm getting off this train yeah I I actually
6000780	6004900	think that I don't think we're headed in into a dark future I think things are
6004900	6009860	really dark now and are likely to be for a little bit but I don't think our
6009860	6018580	future is dark I think I think we're in a very difficult transition period where
6018620	6025180	we've lost that like I was saying that that man in the sky to tell us what to
6025180	6030700	do and we've overextended individual freedom so much that we feel completely
6030700	6036420	spiritually lost and now I think it's going to be about bringing things back
6036420	6042660	together hopefully but without reliance on on because God said so but instead
6042660	6047700	because this is what's good for everybody I think we're gonna build a new
6047740	6051300	morality system is what I think is going to happen because it's kind of
6051300	6057620	already happening you know the idea that porn is bad for you if if you said
6057620	6062540	that five years ago or ten years ago people would be like shut up who cares
6062540	6069940	you know no it's not and now that actually that idea is is taking hold
6069940	6074980	people are understanding why porn is so bad for you and many people are
6075020	6079220	choosing to stay away from it completely stay away from it same with
6079220	6086380	alcohol same with birth control you know birth control is just considered this
6086380	6091540	magic thing and now there's so much awareness being spread that birth
6091540	6096340	control is actually devastating to your hormones and that you should
6096340	6100940	absolutely get away from it and many people are resentful that their doctors
6100940	6104740	their primary care physicians didn't warn them about the side effects that
6104820	6108500	they could expect because a lot of people women felt suicidal on it emotional on
6108500	6114220	it still do and and then the impact on it later is is after once once you get
6114220	6119020	off of it is also pretty pretty big but again people like Andrew Huberman you
6119020	6125020	know is shedding a lot of light on stuff like that so I think we're and and even
6125020	6128460	fatherlessness now that's like a big conversation that we're having right I
6129020	6136820	think it's all sort of gone from research to entering the the general
6136820	6142340	conversation and now it's just going to spread from here and there's this whole
6142340	6150340	slice of society that's so intent upon making themselves as great as possible
6150340	6154100	and I think they watch your channels like yours they watch channels like Chris
6154180	6160660	Williamson like and Andrew Huberman Brett Weinstein and Jordan Peterson and
6160660	6167780	they they are intent upon building a good life for themselves that's you know
6167780	6172700	without caffeine or like full of workouts and and you know thinking about their
6172700	6177700	problems and not you know suppressing them it's like all these great things and
6177700	6181740	then also understanding their moral code or understanding the value of
6181740	6187180	religion I mean how many people watched Jordan Peterson's lecture on on Genesis
6187180	6193220	and then his seminar on on Exodus I mean people are engaging that without being
6193220	6197420	religious themselves and they're seeing that kind of like the Chesterton's
6197420	6201540	fence thing is that you know religion has its values you don't have to turn
6201540	6209020	into a dogmatic you know person who's going and looking down at everybody for
6209420	6212900	believing certain not believe not believing certain ideas which is what
6212900	6217620	religion really turned into for a lot of people is that it became this tool for
6217620	6220620	their ego and to beat down on other people and tell them they're going to
6220620	6227260	hell but no religion has individual value that's so that's so wonderful and I
6227260	6230500	think it's all about taking the ego out of it and I think that's going to be the
6230500	6233940	new form of morality that's going to burgeon up it's going to be an
6233940	6239500	intellectual morality and and and so I I'm very hopeful that a lot of things
6239500	6245780	are going to turn around that's that's brilliant yeah I love what you just said
6245780	6251260	and I think we've now had enough time to see the second order effects of a lot of
6251260	6254780	things that we thought were like the solutions to be all and all solutions and
6254780	6260460	now we're saying okay 20 years later what's the second order effects of all
6260460	6264020	these antidepressants we've given everybody yeah what's the second order
6264020	6270580	effects of all the ADHD medication we've given out birth control you know we're
6270580	6274980	now starting to see oh wow there you know you there's nothing no such thing as a
6274980	6280980	free lunch we know there's there's an impact there's unintended consequences
6280980	6285940	to everything so unfortunately we're still doing things right now where we're
6285940	6291020	gonna see down the line the second order effects but I think a lot of people
6291020	6296140	that are optimistic enough to be parents in this modern world are going to have
6296140	6300540	the tools now to teach their kids about second order effects instead of saying
6300540	6304780	hey no you can't do that hey don't watch porn no matter what you're not allowed
6304780	6307860	to and they say why and you're like I don't know it's bad instead of saying
6307860	6312580	that you could lay out a path and say look down the line this is how it affects
6312580	6318460	you and this is how it'll derail your entire life so it depends on what you
6318460	6323940	want if you want a family and a successful career and to be fit you can't
6323940	6328380	get derailed in this way yeah but if your goal is just to be derailed or if
6328380	6334660	you don't have a goal then by all means go down these impulsive paths yes but I
6334660	6339220	think it's having the ability to lay that out for a next generation is really
6339220	6345060	important so that they have like a healthy compass of the world because like
6345060	6349780	in Genesis the first one of the first stories it is human nature to want to
6349780	6353540	do what we're not allowed to that's like the first thing humans want to do God
6353540	6357220	puts Adam and Eve on earth and says don't eat that fruit first thing they're
6357220	6361460	gonna do is eat it so right you know maybe if he explained what happens if you
6361460	6366180	eat it they would have chosen differently yeah yeah and my husband or I
6366260	6370700	talking about that because he recently gave up alcohol I say recently but it's
6370700	6374420	been more than a year and it's funny because every time he tells people that
6374420	6379860	he gave up alcohol people say well were you an alcoholic you know it's like
6379860	6383740	they assume that you had this major problem and that's why you had to give
6383740	6389420	it up when he just realized like I just didn't feel good with it and and one of
6389420	6392700	the things he was thinking about is like oh when we have kids at least I feel
6392700	6398420	more now emboldened and empowered with with information to say why you should
6398420	6402620	not drink alcohol or have a healthy relationship with it at least but that
6402620	6406860	when he was growing up it was just like because I said so and same with me and
6406860	6412140	the ideas around modesty I grew up in a very modest household I grew up you know
6412140	6417300	and I took to it I wasn't really rebellious about it I actually felt
6417300	6424020	like it actually felt kind of natural to me to be modest and but as I grew up it
6424020	6427300	started to make sense to me and I of course tested a lot of the theories out
6427300	6433020	when I was in college because I did want to have my rebellious time but I had to
6433020	6438060	like stumble into the understanding of why me treating my body as something
6438060	6441660	that was sacred was important for my mental health and for me to actually
6441660	6445020	have a very successful relationship then in the future with whoever I ended up
6445020	6450060	with forever is that then he also knew that I had treated my body as very
6450060	6458180	sacred and wasn't so it was it took time to understand that and now and and now
6458180	6462380	you know you have writers like Louis Louis Perry explaining the ideas of why
6462380	6467100	modesty is so important or you know you shouldn't get drunk around you know
6467100	6470580	these in these like frat parties of because of what kind of impact that
6470580	6476060	might have on you and she does it all without lending to religion at all and
6476060	6482060	and if she had you know I don't think it's wrong to rely on religion but I
6482060	6486900	think people feel like religion is an incomplete answer to them and so it's
6486900	6490620	like she's instead explaining like the full path of it and bringing it back to
6490620	6494580	the individuals like what exactly happens you know if you if you engage in
6494580	6498980	in one path versus another I think we're just getting those like very detailed
6498980	6503980	answers to things yeah we're very lucky right now where we're living in this age
6503980	6508820	of we have so much access to information yes I'm so grateful to people like
6508820	6513740	Jordan Peterson who are taking all these incredible philosophers and old texts
6513740	6518300	and he's filtering it down into such an easy way to understand and same with
6518300	6523540	religious texts too yeah it's because of Jordan Peterson that I've looked into
6523540	6528540	Carl Jung and Victor Frankel and all these other philosophers that you know
6528580	6531460	you hear him mention a name enough times you're like okay I should probably
6531460	6536700	check out that book yeah and it's he's really been like well I guess you could
6536700	6542300	bring it down to like Joe Rogan Joe Rogan led me to him and then he led me to
6542300	6547140	like 20 other great philosophers and I keep going down this rabbit hole now I'm
6547140	6552940	like getting into these very obscure ancient occult type things and I'm like
6552940	6561660	wow yeah okay is this an okay time for me to tell you about a bit Bushina do you
6561660	6566380	want to do you want to talk about that yeah because I think I think it it's a
6566380	6575620	good wrap on everything as well so I told you this but I at the end of last
6575620	6582820	year went for a 10-day silent retreat it's called the Bushina where you live
6582860	6588780	like a monk for 10 days you don't you have certain precepts like morality
6588780	6592580	precepts that you have to follow for example you don't engage in misconduct
6592580	6596620	you don't lie for those 10 days you're sort of taking this oath you don't kill
6596620	6600900	anything so even if there's an insect in your room they have like a little way
6600900	6603980	for you to take it out so you don't kill the insects you're eating vegetarian
6603980	6611260	food but specifically it's through this organization called it's maybe it's called
6611300	6621940	just dhamma d-h-a-m-m-a and it follows it follows the precepts set by Buddhism
6621940	6627300	like Buddha specifically from you know centuries ago and Buddha himself
6627300	6632620	discovered this practice when he was meditating and he discovered it based on
6632620	6637140	ancient Indian texts that were sort of lost so he rediscovered this technique
6637140	6642980	and then he crystallized it into this method of 10 days of meditation that
6642980	6648060	help you achieve start to achieve sort of an understanding of your path to
6648060	6655100	enlightenment and my friend convinced me to do this I was a very very skeptical
6655100	6659340	she's been trying to convince me for 10 years but the idea of being in silence
6659340	6664820	and without any access to you know my material world felt very frightening to
6664820	6671380	me and I'm so glad I went she finally convinced me and I went and the the
6671380	6675420	whole idea is that it's actually completely free and they don't even let
6675420	6682700	you donate before you take a course so that's actually part of the mechanism
6682700	6687740	to get you into the right mindset which is that you are here with all this room
6687740	6694460	and board and and food that's being served to you is you're here on the by
6694460	6698540	the grace of other people's charity other ex-students have paid for for your
6698540	6703980	ability to be here and that alone that's that begins that sort of humility
6703980	6712140	practice to help you recognize that you need to then maybe this is a good time
6712140	6716980	to sort of rethink your approach to life because you know modern life we're
6716980	6720980	relying on ourselves we go out and about like I pay for my lunch you know
6720980	6725980	I'm I've been relying on myself for for you know better part of you know 20
6725980	6730220	years whatever so to suddenly be there on someone else's charity felt very
6730220	6733500	strange but that's how monks and nuns live right and that's what you're
6733500	6738780	engaging in you're engaging in the very simple life and you're not allowed to
6738780	6742260	talk to anybody you can't look at anybody in the eye everything's kind of
6742260	6746660	set up as like a self-service situation and the men and women are completely
6746780	6750580	separated so that you're not distractions to each other and then the
6750580	6754420	primary thing you're doing is that you're meditating pretty much for most of
6754420	6758340	the day it's like 10 hours of meditation a day and you learn a specific
6758340	6763060	meditation technique so even though you're not allowed to talk to anybody
6763060	6768060	they do have a discourse where the teacher teaches you about the system of
6768060	6772260	meditation and why it's important so you're kind of learning the tenets of
6773020	6778500	dhamma and it's a non-religious completely you know completely sort of
6778500	6785340	secular universal ideas that they talk about and they all they talk about the
6785340	6792420	the kind of what is what is the cause of everyone's misery and you know this is
6792420	6796180	something Buddhists talk about all the time which is attachment but specifically
6796180	6800500	what they talk about is this we're caught in the cycle of craving and a
6800500	6805100	versions and this was something that was really important for me because I am
6805100	6813060	actually prone to this massive iPhone addiction I mean it was bad and that was
6813060	6816180	something I realized that every time through this practice every time I was
6816180	6821420	you know writing a video for my for my channel and I would run into something
6821420	6825060	difficult some difficult part I didn't know what to write as the next sentence
6825380	6831020	immediately pick up the phone right it's because I had an aversion felt terrible
6831020	6836100	had a craving to stop the aversion pick up the phone phone is a distraction you
6836100	6839580	know and that's sort of how I've been living my life for some time now of
6839580	6844380	just using my phone as a distraction and what's amazing about Vipassana is that
6844380	6849660	you have nowhere to run you are meditating you're going inward you don't
6849660	6853180	have anyone to talk to you you don't have any distractions of modern life like
6853220	6856540	your phone like your computer but you don't even have an occupation you don't
6856540	6861180	even have a job to keep you mentally busy you just have to reconcile with
6861180	6869180	yourself and that whole forced process of that you're just sitting with yourself
6869180	6875100	is so interesting it's it's really difficult it's extremely difficult it
6875100	6879980	was like way too much time to spend with myself but the learnings out of it are
6880020	6883420	so incredible and then what you start to notice through the Vipassana practice of
6883420	6889060	the specific type of meditation which I won't get into here but it actually
6889060	6893460	starts getting all of your all those things that you've been running from it
6893460	6898220	allows it to come out it allows it to surface and it'll surface these are as
6898220	6904660	a thought or as a sensation on your body or emotion and they warn they warn you
6904660	6909100	that specific days tend to be really difficult for people and fifth day was
6909100	6912300	the first day that I noticed that a lot of people were crying around me and I
6912300	6916860	was very emotional it's like stuff just it's just there's been enough time that
6916860	6919860	you've been sitting in silence that stuff starts to really come out and that's
6919860	6925460	what the whole practice is really about is just try to recognize the misery cycle
6925460	6929300	that people tend to keep themselves in and how to release themselves from it
6929300	6935620	and it was the most transformative experience of my life it's something you
6935660	6939780	know I know you're curious about it I would highly highly recommend but that's
6939780	6943740	also why I wanted to bring it up here in case this is something that is
6943740	6948100	interesting to other people they should definitely check it out because I think
6948100	6953580	it's a very easy we live in a world where we can get every one of our sort of
6953580	6957140	immediate needs met sort of what you've you've been talking about this you know
6957140	6961860	the sketch you were talking about so it's a very hard to meet our it's very
6961900	6967340	easy to meet our basic needs it's our spiritual needs that go completely
6967340	6973740	ignored and this was a great opportunity to sort of reset my priorities like one
6973740	6979140	of the things I noticed is that I I love my family I love my husband I love my
6979140	6984900	friends and mentally I was deprioritizing them over my phone that like
6984900	6988300	there was a part of me that was irritated if someone was talking to me
6988300	6991140	because that meant I wasn't on my phone I mean that's how bad my addiction was
6991220	6997260	I mean it's really embarrassing to even say it but this thing completely helped me
6997260	7004220	see that and I felt that ache that that's what I was doing in my life and and so
7004220	7007620	it helps you sort of reset a lot of things actually understand what your real
7007620	7016660	priorities are that sounds amazing wow so that was 10 days 10 days how did it
7016700	7023100	seem like 10 days or did it seem longer seem longer definitely seem longer and I
7023100	7028180	think the first couple of days like past classially slow because the meditation
7028180	7031700	periods you know are really long and then it changes your perception of time
7031700	7036380	you know suddenly sitting because you meditate for one hour at a time just
7036380	7042700	just about and that first couple of sessions felt so long and then slowly
7042700	7046100	you're like oh one hour meditation doesn't sound that bad you know any more
7046740	7050660	and and now we keep up the practice you have to you know if you want to continue
7050660	7054900	to engage with it it's up to you but you you keep up a daily practice of it as
7054900	7059580	well but yeah I did feel it incredibly long and then especially at the end
7059580	7063420	because one of the things I just really struggled with was just missing company
7063420	7069020	it's like I'm really lonely and so I got to I think by day nine I just started
7069020	7075140	started to really like come on we're almost there almost there wow so have
7075180	7080340	you had enough time to process the experience like have you changed yes I
7080340	7086380	have I think I think there were a lot of ideas if you go let's say I think what
7086380	7089980	you might find is that there are a lot of ideas that aren't really new to you
7089980	7093220	you've been circling around them you know in your in your intellectual
7093220	7097460	endeavors just like as you know that's how I felt because I think they're all
7097460	7103060	ideas that that makes sense on a universal level whether it's Thomas's I'm
7103060	7106020	telling you about it or Jordan Peterson talking about it or Carl Jung talking
7106020	7110140	about it there are a lot of similarities in the in that understanding but there
7110140	7113820	was one final piece that felt like it was missing where I was like circling
7113820	7122460	around the ideas but that didn't mean that it had internalized quite so as
7122460	7127060	part of this this philosophy you know the teachings of Dhamma one of the things
7127060	7130740	he talks about is that there are three types of the main teacher his name is
7130780	7135820	Goenka who has passed on now but there are recordings of him where he he he just
7135820	7141220	gives the lesson and one of the things he talks about is that there are three
7141220	7147780	different types of wisdom one is you hear someone else give you a piece of
7147780	7152420	wisdom another is that you yourself understand it where you can intellectually
7152420	7157420	and completely understand it and relate it to other people but then there's a
7157420	7163140	third piece of wisdom where you feel it and he gave the example of of medicine
7163140	7167540	that if a doctor tells you oh you're sick you need to take this medicine and you
7167540	7171540	say oh that's great doctor thank you for this medicine that's you
7171540	7175540	recognizing this other person giving you this piece of wisdom you can go and
7175540	7180380	possess the medicine that's you understanding it you go went to the
7180380	7186300	pharmacy and filled up your prescription but until you take it it's not going to
7186300	7191660	help you and that was the piece that I felt was missing where I you know one
7191660	7194980	of the things that's due to the difficulties of the last couple of
7194980	7200940	years my it's it's really taken a toll on my body so for what you know for about
7200940	7206300	a year ago I just came out of this period where I had a lot had like massive
7206300	7211860	hair fall like massive hair fall and I also developed a chronic health issue in
7211860	7217020	that in that period so it was like I understood the ideas that people were
7217020	7223260	telling me intellectually but I hadn't quite internalized it where it wasn't
7223260	7228060	being all these issues and miseries of my life were still being stored in my
7228060	7231980	body and we're still taking a toll on me mentally and physically and
7231980	7239820	spiritually and this this going to this helped take me to that finish line
7239860	7244140	where I'm not saying I'm fixed or anything like that but at least
7244140	7248700	understanding the principle of how to help myself and how to engage with
7248700	7256460	with with with my issues that was that was extremely extremely necessary that's
7256460	7264740	incredible it sounds like an experience I could benefit greatly from I'm you're
7264740	7271420	not gonna change too much though right I might become too zen and just float
7271420	7276060	out of here do you think this is gonna inform your future content are you
7276060	7280420	gonna take it in a different direction yes I think so I think you know one of
7280420	7285020	the conversations you and I had had last time like I was telling you the you know
7285020	7298300	you've inspired me to be less sort of a tacky about things and more more sort of
7298300	7303220	create positive visions for things so I you know you had you had sort of told
7303220	7306620	me about how you think about those things and that was something I was kind
7306620	7311900	of mulling over in my mind and now I understood why that's so important for
7311940	7316820	me to do that so I don't want to be sitting in just bashing things and it's
7316820	7320860	okay I think to criticize stuff I don't I don't think there's anything wrong with
7320860	7324460	that I think that's a necessary part of any dialogue but to be constantly
7324460	7328140	dunking on something is not something that I want to engage with I think that
7328140	7334140	that instead trying to spread as much positivity and love as possible is is
7334140	7340660	really what what I kind of gleaned from from this experience that's amazing I
7340660	7346780	think for the last couple years the level of cynicism has been increasing but I
7346780	7351940	feel like it it might get to a breaking point where people are gonna get keen to
7351940	7357140	it and say I'm done with this cynicism because even even in our area we're like
7357140	7362460	critical drinker he'll make a video about how horrible a movie is and that will
7362460	7366140	get three million views and then he'll say hey this movie is pretty good and
7366140	7370140	that'll get like a couple hundred thousand views yeah and even myself like
7370140	7374860	when I see he's like he says this movie really sucks I'm like oh this is gonna
7374860	7378340	be a great review yeah let's hear a critical drinker just dunk on this movie
7378340	7383700	yeah but same same that's fine I hope he keeps doing that yeah but because the
7383700	7388300	movies do suck they need to get dunked on but yeah someone has to dunk on them
7388620	7395100	and he does it so well yeah we need a positive image of the future we need a
7395100	7401660	vision that we can that gets us out of bed in the morning and I was I just did a
7401660	7408260	podcast about the pyramids in Egypt and one thing that's so special about them
7408260	7411940	is they're so mysterious but when you see them you realize that possibilities
7411940	7416980	are endless and you're looking at something that is impenetrable to time
7417740	7422500	and for one moment you get a glimpse into this thing that is like eternal and
7422500	7427300	it makes you feel like you're part of this thing that's eternal and that even
7427300	7432100	though your physical body was gonna go away part of your essence can just like
7432100	7438820	ripple on forever and when you it's easy when you're in this matrix world where
7438820	7442500	everything's so temporary and the buildings are all concrete and glass and
7442620	7447300	everything's put together so fast and carelessly you kind of feel like you're
7447300	7454900	just a cognitive machine you're just disposable and yeah I feel like the
7454900	7460340	importance of getting outside of the matrix into these situations like what
7460340	7464540	you just did or seeing the pyramids or just anything that takes you out of
7464540	7470100	your normal state of consciousness yeah maybe it's psychedelics who knows can
7470140	7476340	show you can can let you touch a different state and see time in a
7476340	7481700	different way see yourself in a different way and step outside yourself so yeah
7481700	7486340	it's very important to to mix things up otherwise it's like roundhog day same
7486340	7491980	thing every day yeah yeah and look you know especially true for SF is that
7491980	7496220	it's very easy to distort your own reality and think that this is life this
7496220	7499740	is everything that's happening the chaos that's happening on these city streets
7500380	7506860	is life and suddenly I found myself in these beautiful woods and it's snowing
7506860	7512700	and they're deer about and woodpeckers in the trees and they're you know ducks in
7512700	7517820	the pond and I thought wow what you know I'm I'm so wrapped up in a one type of
7517820	7524420	existence that I can't I can't even perceive anything else sometimes so it's
7524420	7529700	good to just like you said just good to break out of it yeah well I don't think
7529700	7532420	your phone addiction is that bad actually because when you were saying
7532420	7537700	that I was like oh boy that's I do the same thing sometimes when somebody's
7537700	7541260	talking to me while I've got my phone out I'm like alright just want to see
7541260	7548820	this one more meme hold on yeah it can get bad yeah I mean it's you know it's
7548820	7554020	it's it's designed to keep you hooked you know it's designed to keep you
7554020	7560220	swiping forever yeah I mean I just got back from a trip and I had my my phone
7560220	7564540	on airplane mode I didn't want to do the roaming and so I my mind was like okay
7564540	7568380	you're gonna be back in Wi-Fi pretty soon you're getting closer to Wi-Fi and I
7568380	7572300	felt like my mind I'm like can you just enjoy what you're doing now instead of
7572300	7576820	worrying about when you're gonna get to that like I felt like a guy that was
7576820	7580900	swimming through the ocean trying to get to an island there's Wi-Fi it was
7581060	7586620	okay I that so okay so as part of the question I they have you you know hand in
7586620	7592020	your phone you can either leave it in your car you leave it in a locker and I
7592020	7596060	found myself not missing the phone at all because I'm on the phone even when
7596060	7601180	I'm brushing my teeth I mean it's like I said it's bad nothing you're saying is
7601180	7607700	that bad I'm glad you're validating that other people are also there doing
7607780	7613420	doing this along with me so I'm not enabling you though no I have changed
7613420	7619340	I'm now reformed hopefully it sticks is the question because you know it's like
7619340	7626060	two weeks we're two weeks out of this so but I did not miss the phone but when
7626060	7631460	it was time to get it again I reached for it in this dark locker it's just a
7631460	7636660	single phone and it honestly felt like I was reaching for the ring from Lord the
7636660	7642060	Rings you know in Gandalf we just down for it and I and it felt like hot in my
7642060	7645900	hand and I went to sit down because I was eating breakfast with my friend she
7645900	7648500	would she's the one who had convinced me so she was there finally we could talk
7648500	7656500	and it was like I was talking to her but like my attention mentally was on that
7656500	7663140	phone and and I thought wow it's so strange because then she got up she left
7663300	7669180	and I turned it on and I saw like my usual you know notifications okay text from
7669180	7674740	mom and dad like okay check my you know Instagram real quick check YouTube real
7674740	7681100	quick cat check Twitter real quick and then I thought really like this is this
7681100	7686420	is the thing yeah but like this is what all the consternation is about just for
7686420	7692380	those like four or five in things of engagement that then you just cycle
7692380	7700300	between all day for what you know and what satisfaction did that give you and
7700300	7704980	that moment you got nothing out of that you got not a damn thing not as much as
7704980	7709180	satisfaction as you had talking to your best friend over you know over breakfast
7709180	7714820	a minute ago and so the whole ride home we had a long ride so I had a long time
7714820	7718580	to think about it and I said okay it has to change like the relationship has to
7718580	7723220	change like it has utility it is the must in modern life but you have to change
7723220	7728540	that it should not be moving on your person at all times like again it's
7728540	7734020	it's like the ring it's like the ring where when I'm walking around and I have
7734020	7738380	my hand in my coat because it's SF so it's cold all the time my hand is around
7738380	7746300	the phone you know like that like that level of engagement with it or what if
7746300	7749780	I'm around the house it's in my back pocket if I'm at my desk it's sitting
7749780	7754140	right here on the desk if I'm standing in the kitchen it's it's on the on the
7754140	7758500	counter next to me if I'm in the bathroom it's in the bathroom with me if I'm in my
7758500	7763660	bedroom it's on my side table why such an intense like it is it's like I'm
7763700	7769900	attached to it and and so I said okay no it's gonna live in the kitchen 24 7 it's
7769900	7774020	not gonna be here next to you if you need it you can get up use it in the
7774020	7778500	kitchen then you can leave it there and come back and that has been the new
7778500	7781700	system so it's not allowed in the bathroom it's not allowed in the bedroom
7781700	7788220	nowhere it just lives in the kitchen and that has been really really good I
7788220	7793620	keep trying to break it but I'm like nope don't forget you know I need to do it
7793620	7797220	for 30 days and then it'll hopefully stick from there and I don't have to
7797220	7803020	force it as much well that's yeah that's a great insight that you tapped into and
7803020	7808540	you're inspiring me I should probably do the same thing I might need the 10-day
7808540	7814580	retreat yeah like jolt me into it yeah it's ironic because we're both content
7814580	7818260	creators or influencers or however you want to put it but it's like we make our
7818260	7822300	career online mm-hmm and a lot of the things that we're spreading our awareness
7822340	7828060	about your behavior which if you listen to us you might get offline so we're
7828060	7834620	like wait don't don't don't listen to us too much yeah yeah I but I also think
7834620	7841380	that you know when I was on the retreat a lot of the time I actually was thinking
7841380	7844180	about when you know when you have breaks and stuff and you're not you're not
7844180	7849120	like meditating I was thinking about a lot of movie scenes I was thinking about
7849160	7854280	TV shows certain quotes that were sticking out to me and like even books
7854280	7858560	certain books and I thought that's one thing I realized is that because of my
7858560	7863200	phone addiction I actually deprioritize all the things that I genuinely love and
7863200	7869480	I mentioned family and friends and my husband but I actually even even art like
7869480	7873720	sitting and watching Lord of the Rings felt feels like oh it takes too much
7873720	7878240	time out of the day but me being on the phone for four hours you know not
7878280	7882640	cumulate are not all at once but cumulatively throughout the day yeah
7882640	7887800	I'm probably on the phone for four four hours so that's okay doing something
7887800	7892520	that brings you no joy but watching something really nice or even a you
7892520	7895960	know a YouTube video that you like that you find informative interesting
7895960	7900920	whatever versus just mindlessly scrolling and I think that was actually the
7900920	7905680	big thing is that I'm still you know I'm still consuming things but it's stuff
7905840	7910560	it's just being about more mindful and what impact it has on me I think that
7910560	7915760	that was the shift is that engaging actually engaging with art on a day-to-day
7915760	7921400	basis versus scrolling Twitter where I had I go through you know 15 different
7921400	7927480	types of emotion in rapid succession in under a minute you know what does that
7927480	7931800	really do for me I'm outraged at this and excited by that and I'm building to
7931800	7935200	this and what does that do for me versus sitting and watching something that I
7935200	7941240	actually really like or find find interesting one of my favorite quotes
7941240	7945920	is from Terrence McKenna he says if you don't have a plan you become a part of
7945920	7951200	somebody else's plan and I think about that quote all the time it's like nobody
7951200	7954360	wakes up in the morning and says today I'm going to spend eight hours on my
7954360	7961440	phone nobody does that right but once you slip into a subconscious state which
7961480	7967880	we operate on 95% of the time your mind just reaches for those programs that are
7967880	7972840	like deep grooves in your your mind yeah and like the more you do in action the
7972840	7977160	deeper the groove is going to be in your mind it's like skiing down a mountain
7977160	7982760	yeah and so you know it's it's like such a deep program like there's certain
7982760	7988200	apps on my phone that I go to all the time and my my finger will automatically
7988200	7993080	scroll and search for that if I move that yeah my thumb like wait where'd that
7993080	7998160	go hmm do it subconsciously and then wait you know I'll do it without thinking
7998160	8002360	yes like I used to go to Facebook so much that I would go on the computer and
8002360	8007040	then my fingers would just type in FAC and I'm like I don't even want to go to
8007040	8011640	Facebook right now why am I doing this or even that moment where I'll like close
8011640	8016000	the app only to reopen it and not even realize like I just closed it and I
8016040	8021800	reopened it and even the instinct that if if my phone is on my desk I will just
8021800	8027120	instinctively instinctively reach for it and it is that that yeah like you're
8027120	8032120	saying it has those groove marks right it's built in after years and years and
8032120	8038080	that's why that what what you learn at the Bush now is that craving it's a
8038080	8043000	craving and you have to meet it immediately and so you just leap to meet
8043000	8047080	it immediately so having that creating that disconnection and recognizing it's
8047080	8053320	that it's just it's that slight form of distance space between the craving craving
8053320	8057400	coming up and you resolving it instead going oh look at that craving I have a
8057400	8061120	craving to be on my phone right now why okay because I just reached something
8061120	8067280	hard in in the script in the in my next video script that I don't know how to
8067280	8072960	resolve and I feel inadequate I feel like maybe I'm not good enough for this
8072960	8076400	maybe I'm not good enough for for what I'm trying to be maybe I'll never be
8076400	8081240	good enough maybe I'll fail at this okay so you're afraid like you know so just
8081240	8087200	taking it that's the weird thing about being a human being is that we're so
8087200	8093040	fear-based we're so anxiety-based and we make these crazy leaps you know we
8093080	8098560	make these crazy leaps of the small thing happens and it'll be like well
8098560	8102920	maybe I'll die because of this you know what I mean it's like maybe
8102920	8108440	psychologically I'm completely completely you know at risk because of
8108440	8113560	this so it's very interesting then then we have these tools to then distract us
8113560	8118360	in the moment and keep us away from that that but it exists somewhere it's
8118360	8124000	always there so it's better to address it rather than let it just just let it
8124000	8130520	hide from you oh yeah that's very inspiring you're I'm definitely gonna
8130520	8134400	make some changes after this conversation thank you thank you for
8134400	8137680	saying that and yes I think you'll find I think you'll find the ten day retreat
8137680	8143440	really helpful in doing it if you know if yeah I'll send you I'll send you some
8143440	8147760	stuff about it after yeah I'd love to check it out clearly becoming a bit
8147960	8154680	pushy well I like it that it's not it's not led by a guru or something right
8154680	8159560	it's kind of just your own experience yeah and they're very anti-ego it's a
8159560	8166080	very anti-ego like anytime there's a group that's led by one individual who's
8166080	8170200	got like all the answers I'm always like I'm not really into cults you know like
8170200	8175000	that's not my thing yeah but this sounds like a very personal journey which
8175160	8178960	I've always been drawn towards those experiences like sensory deprivation
8178960	8184960	tank or psychedelic journey or something like that yeah those have kind of sparked
8184960	8188680	my interest more because it's like I don't know you're just grappling with
8188680	8194480	your own inner journey hmm exactly I think this you know micro dosing around
8194480	8200360	psychedelics is is fascinating it's really really interesting yeah it's
8200360	8204400	something I've covered a lot of my channel yeah but it's definitely not the
8204520	8209680	all-end-all cure like people are going crazy with it now yeah it's that I like
8209680	8212760	by the way I like how you think in quotes because I feel like I think in
8212760	8217720	scenes and like movie scenes I think you think in quotes and you come up with the
8217720	8222840	best ones they like the exact right quotes but there's that that that one I
8222840	8227800	think it's a Carl Jung quote that don't be careful of unearned wisdom am I am I
8227800	8233480	right about that I'll have to look into that one that's a good one be careful of
8233480	8237000	unearned wisdom yeah and I think it relates to this is that you know
8237000	8242240	psychedelics is if people think that it's an easy route to wisdom but it's
8242240	8246280	really it's really not it's yeah it's it's more about building on what you're
8246280	8252000	already doing like aiding that rather than suddenly catapulting you into
8252000	8259640	massive realizations 100% well this has been an amazing conversation thank you
8259640	8264200	and I'm so excited for our collaboration to come out me too when this
8264200	8269200	podcast is out it'll be out so hopefully people love it and if you want to
