00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:14,040
Hi, Jamie. Welcome. Good to be here, Mark. Yeah, so I've recently discovered your talks

2
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:17,800
and lectures and I haven't read your books yet, but what I've seen thus far has been

3
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:21,840
awesome. Daniel Schmockdenberger referred me and said I have to talk to you. So I'm

4
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:26,840
really excited to talk to you today. Yeah, happy to dive in. I mean, just getting to

5
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:32,320
check out some of your beautiful drawing and animations on YouTube. It seems like you're

6
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:37,520
barking up a number of very diverse and eclectic trees, but there is that kind of theme of

7
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:43,040
sort of just better understanding, you know, the human condition, our past and our future.

8
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:47,640
So, you know, obviously happy to jump in on all those things. Yes, I think that you and

9
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:53,240
I are very aligned on what we're interested in, like from existential crisis to meaning

10
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:58,120
to psychedelics and everything in between. So I'm really excited to just see where this

11
00:00:58,120 --> 00:01:04,280
conversation goes. For sure. So I thought we could start by just, you could introduce

12
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:11,800
yourself to the audience. Sure. So my name is Jamie Wheel, and I am the founding executive

13
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:18,360
director of the Flow Genome Project, which is an organization dedicated to the research

14
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:24,040
and training of peak performance and leadership, and so sort of combination of neuroscience,

15
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:28,160
anthropology, optimal psychology, and then, you know, quite often adventure leadership

16
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:32,880
fun things to do in the wild and backcountry and mountains and oceans. And we get to work

17
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:36,760
with everybody from, you know, executives at companies like Google and Deloitte and

18
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:41,600
Disney and Lululemon and places like that, but also privileged to work with some of the

19
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:47,400
tier one special operations community in the world, the SAS and Santos Military Academy

20
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:54,160
in the UK, as well as SEAL Team 6 and Dev Group here in the US, and really always just

21
00:01:54,160 --> 00:02:01,080
curious about what makes us come alive, what lets us feel and perform at our best. And

22
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:04,680
then fundamentally kind of almost back to the old school Greeks, you know, what is a

23
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:10,720
good life well lived. And that inquiry has also led to me writing a couple of books.

24
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:15,800
One was called Stealing Fire, and that was really trying to sort of trace and track the

25
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:21,360
multi-thousand year history of ecstatic cultures, like those communities of practice that have

26
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:26,640
sought and made the most of non-ordinary states of being. And again, that goes all the way

27
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:32,760
back to one of Socrates' senior students stealing the psychedelic brew from the Lucidian

28
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:37,480
Mysteries and throwing a house party in Athens, which was kind of a wonderfully weird and

29
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:43,880
funny story, risking life and banishment, you know, to do so, all the way to contemporary

30
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:49,600
expressions like Burning Man and other situations. And then most recently, I wrote a book called

31
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:56,040
Recapture the Rapture, Rethinking God, Sex and Death in a World that's Lost its Mind.

32
00:02:56,040 --> 00:03:01,080
And really that one is just to say, hey, where are we going as a civilization? Feels like

33
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:06,640
we're in kind of a tight spot. Seems like we're going to need to get much better at

34
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:12,440
processing our grief at skillful and responsible accessing of peak states and connecting to

35
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:19,040
each other in resilient, anti-fragile ways that don't end up in the ditch of dysfunctional

36
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:25,200
or cultic communities. So how do we do this thing is fundamentally the ongoing inquiry?

37
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:30,400
And what are some ways to have, you know, to have as meaningful and purposeful and healthy

38
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:33,800
and happy and joyful lives as we can along the way?

39
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:38,840
Oh, that's all brilliant. And I'm excited to dive deep. But first, I think I need to

40
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:44,280
stop you and have you tell that story about the Illusinian Mysteries. Oh, I've been really

41
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:50,080
fascinated with that whole ritual, the psychedelic brew. And so somebody stole the brew?

42
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:57,120
Yeah, it's such a crazy story. And I actually shared it with a friend, Brian Marorescu,

43
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:01,160
who wrote the immortality which kind of right, which blew up and expanded the story,

44
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:05,800
which was fundamentally, I mean, Brian, Brian's new contribution is the, what does he call it,

45
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:10,280
the archaeochemistry or something, but basically actually the fine grain scraping of the pots

46
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:14,320
and things to see what was actually in them versus just the written record. But he was

47
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:22,720
really just dusting off Ruck and Wasson's thesis from way back in the day about the potential

48
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:30,960
LSA, you know, ergot fungus as the actual psychoactive kicker in the Greek Illusinian Mysteries.

49
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:35,280
But what's so interesting about the Illusinian Mysteries is they persisted for 2000 years.

50
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:41,080
You know, you're like, holy shit, like what cultural anything continues for 2000 years. And

51
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:46,000
here's one of the wilder and woollier state experiences. And this is Plutarch and Cicero

52
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:50,400
and Plato and arguably all the way back to Pythagoras and the Presocratics, like there was

53
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:58,040
some serious juju coming out of this over a week long ritual with sleep deprivation and chanting

54
00:04:58,040 --> 00:05:03,640
and pageantry and costumes and all these other kind of state shifting technologies. But then

55
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:11,920
also Kukion, this arguably quite credibly psychoactive brew. And if you were an initiate

56
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:18,680
into the mysteries, you weren't allowed to share it or talk about it on pain of death. And so

57
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:24,760
about 20 years ago, I was doing research and I just remember this random little snippet of an

58
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:32,800
account from sort of Plato's era of a court case about someone having stolen the Kukion and

59
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:38,400
then making use of it. And so in the writing of Stealing Fire, I was like, oh, I remember that.

60
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:41,760
I've got to get back to that, dust it off, see what it was. The story was actually even better

61
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:50,240
than I remembered. It turned out it was Alcibiades, who was this like rascal of a senior student of

62
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:55,240
Socrates and potentially they were lovers. So he was kind of his like chicken boy, you know,

63
00:05:55,400 --> 00:06:01,720
slash like like sketchy sketchy sketchy teacher student relationships. But Alcibiades himself

64
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:09,400
was a rascal. He then steals it. He ends up throwing a huge house party with the magic potion. So

65
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:13,880
this is not that different than like Silicon Valley billionaires going to Burning Man, you know,

66
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:19,320
and blowing the roof off the thing, he then gets ratted out by some rivals. And he ends up then

67
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:24,200
betraying Athens. He's like this crazy double crosser, all sorts of things. He ends up actually,

68
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:30,200
I just read two weeks ago, I think he ends up getting murdered in the end. But like his story

69
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:36,040
is absolutely off the chart. So that idea that, you know, we often think of ancient things as very

70
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:40,600
kind of stuffy and respectable, you know, and buttoned down. And that was the way they did

71
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:44,200
things back in the past. And if we want to be respectable, we should do things more like they

72
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:49,800
did not how we do now. And then you kind of realize this was almost identical. And it was literally

73
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:57,400
like it was was it 22,000 or 2,500, whatever it was, it was almost to the day, an anniversary of

74
00:06:57,400 --> 00:07:06,200
when Ken Kesey was at Stanford University, unbeknowingly, taking MK Ultra, you know, the government

75
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:13,160
psyops projects, taking their LSD as part of a medical study and stealing it out of the cabinets

76
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:18,840
and taking it back to Stanford and lighting up all of the, you know, this was Larry McMurtry,

77
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:24,680
the writer, this was where at Abbey Wallace Stegner, you know, all these like literary giants

78
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:30,680
were there and they were literally like early 60s, getting lit up with exactly the same process,

79
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:37,320
stealing fire, right, stealing the psychedelic magic. And then that booted up and turned on

80
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:41,320
everything from the Grateful Dead is their house band, they were just a bunch of funky

81
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:46,360
musicians in Palo Alto at the time, they pioneered psychedelic rock, which is now happening at the

82
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:51,720
Sphere in Las Vegas with John Mayer, taking Jerry Garcia's place, you know, one of the largest

83
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:59,480
grossing acts to this day over the last five years is still that lineage, as is all the Silicon

84
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:05,560
Valley from the Homebrew Computer Club, all the way to the imaginings of AR and VR, all the way

85
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:12,760
into the entire Burning Man culture and community, goes back to Ken Kesey stealing that government

86
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:19,720
asset and throwing a house party. So the parallels are just, you know, you couldn't make up. And I

87
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:25,480
think they are, they are fascinating because there's always that question of, can you bottle

88
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:31,960
lightning without getting burned? You know, is there something that is tricksy? Is there something

89
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:38,600
squirrely? Is there something inherently unstable and therefore kind of not scalable, right, about

90
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:47,240
these experiences and also about the utterly predictable backlashes that they almost always

91
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:53,240
seem to precipitate? And even just last week, right, we had the maps, FDA clinical trials,

92
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:58,520
getting the hard breaks and the committee voting 10 to 1 against approving it because there's been

93
00:08:58,520 --> 00:09:05,480
a lot more scrutiny and a lot more attention. This was a MDMA, right? This was for the MDMA

94
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:13,240
trial. This is a 40 year effort. And it's right there at the goal line. And potentially getting

95
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:22,920
and potentially getting sidelined. And Jesus, I'm going to grab a drink.

96
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:34,360
Yeah, yeah, yeah, no problem.

97
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:53,080
All good. You are on fire right now. I am loving the pace of this podcast.

98
00:09:53,720 --> 00:10:00,200
Oh, great. Yeah, great, great. This is just me on normal settings. So we can play however you want.

99
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:08,520
So the MDMA studies. So the MDMA studies and the FDA's oversight committee basically had to

100
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:12,760
sift through, there was a petition and a kind of a complaint that, hey, things were a little fast

101
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:16,520
and loose here with this, with this, you know, taking this drug to market and moving through all

102
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:22,440
the phases of the trials. And one of the comments really struck me, which was one of the most

103
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:29,080
significant concerns was, hey, by the way, we've heard that this MDMA, one of the known side effects

104
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:37,960
is euphoria. And that's concerning, because euphoria means it has a high potential for abuse.

105
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:45,640
And you think now, wait a second, this is the same FDA that Greenlit, Adderall and Ritalin,

106
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:51,160
basically we've had, you know, and just in the last 18 months even, there's been a

107
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:56,520
published report being like, oh yeah, by the way, all you parents that were talked into

108
00:10:56,520 --> 00:11:02,360
putting your little developmental kids on amphetamines for their adolescence and

109
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:05,880
neurological development, there is no correlation between them, between that,

110
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:10,600
and them doing any better in academic outcomes. They just kind of slipped that one into the

111
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:17,320
news cycle like, sorry, kids, 30, 30 years of creating little speed freaks. And it wasn't even

112
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:23,160
going to help them get into college. Right. So we did that. We did Celebrex, which turned out

113
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:28,360
to be a huge, the largest settlement, class action settlement on killing people with a drug.

114
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:31,720
What was Celebrex? We definitely did put in. What is Celebrex?

115
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:36,920
Well, gosh, now I'm gonna, let me think, it might even be worth doing. Celebrex sounds familiar.

116
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:46,040
So Celebrex, it might, what is the largest pharma settlement? It could be another one of those.

117
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:52,680
It says Celebrex is used to treat pain and redness, swelling and heat inflammation.

118
00:11:55,000 --> 00:12:01,640
Oh, Vioxx. Vioxx. Right. We did Vioxx. We definitely did oxycontin,

119
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:10,920
you know, and all of those drugs made it just fine through the process. But we are having real

120
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:18,040
issues and hyperscrutinizing, one that also has euphoria. And HL Makin was that famous kind of

121
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:25,560
very funny newspaper publisher back in the early 20th century. I think he said Protestantism,

122
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:29,800
you know, and he said the definition of Protestantism is that sneaking suspicion

123
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:37,640
that somebody somewhere is having a good time. Right. And so you can see like all the way back to

124
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:42,280
Alcibiades back in ancient Greece and being taken to task for outing the mysteries, which,

125
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:47,560
you know, fair cop, those were the road rules. Right. But nonetheless, it was fun enough, whatever

126
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:53,320
that experience was, it was fun enough. He wanted to steal the magic brew for a house party

127
00:12:54,280 --> 00:13:00,280
all the way to Keezy in the early 60s at Stanford, unwittingly interacting with MKUltra,

128
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:07,400
the Mind Control Government Project that Stranger Things is based on. Right. All the way to our

129
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:15,320
current situation where we have MDA running up against FDA concerns about they might be having

130
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:21,720
a little too much fun and we need to put those extra extra screws to them. So for me, that's

131
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:27,880
you can boil it almost down to so what is that dynamic through through the ages is the sort of

132
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:35,960
ongoing battle between the priests and the Prometheans. You know, there's always the priest

133
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:41,800
class and they start out, you know, wearing black cassocks. Now they're the shiny men in

134
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:46,920
black, the feds. Right. But it's still those in control of the status quo and the norms

135
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:53,080
who are empowered to police consciousness. And then the honest to God Prometheans. Right. I mean,

136
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:59,720
all the way back to the ancient myth. Prometheus is like, Hey, Daddy Zeus. It seems like there's a

137
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:03,720
bunch of cold, starving, shivering little monkeys down there and I'm taking pity on them. Can we

138
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:09,160
help them out? And Zeus is like, hell no. If we did, they'd get too epiti for their own good.

139
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:13,000
Right. And Prometheus is like, all right, well, I'm going to do this anyway. My heart bleeds for

140
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:17,160
them. Right. He's kind of an, he's almost like a Hellenic Christ figure. Right. And he's like,

141
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:21,320
okay, so I'm going to do this on behalf of them. And he doesn't just bring them fire. He brings

142
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:28,360
them civilization, technology, pottery, language, medicine, all of it. Right. And then there's

143
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:35,160
hell to pay. Right. And so we see that that oscillating dynamic that the Prometheans find the juice

144
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:39,720
wherever it is, wherever it's been buried, wherever it's been hidden, wherever it's been locked up,

145
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:46,440
they free it. And there's almost always these explosive renaissance is right celebrations,

146
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:52,360
rocking good parties. And then that starts giving you know, then other people start finding out

147
00:14:52,360 --> 00:15:00,280
about it, it draws attention, and then invariably gets shut down. And the real tell is the extreme

148
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:05,720
prejudice with which it gets shut down. You know, it's not, hey, guys, cool it off. You know,

149
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:11,000
turn down the music by 11, you know, make sure you clean up when you're done. It is like literally the

150
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:19,320
most aggressive and violent reactive repression you could possibly imagine. And so it seems like,

151
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:23,640
yeah, that, that, that ain't shell making quote, that idea of that, you know, the sneaking suspicion

152
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:29,640
that somebody somewhere is having a good time. Right. And even last year with when Burning Man

153
00:15:29,640 --> 00:15:36,760
got, you know, rained out. And it was, I think, arguably the first year of that event, where

154
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:43,880
the people at just because of enough starlings on site, right, there was a it became the first

155
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:49,000
extremely online burn in history. Because in the past, you used to schlep it out to the desert,

156
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:52,600
you were completely unplugged and out of touch for, you know, a week to two weeks,

157
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:55,880
depending on how long you were there. And you were out of contact with all civilization,

158
00:15:55,880 --> 00:16:00,520
that was part of the magic and the mystery of it. This was an extremely online burn.

159
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:04,360
And you had all the haters, and you had the New York Post, and you had crazy TikTokers,

160
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:09,480
and you had right alt right wing nuts on Telegram talking about how this was a federal,

161
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:13,400
this was Operation Mockingbird or whatever, you know, and then they were going to inject everybody

162
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:17,320
with Ebola, you had people weighing in like that, you had people being like, Oh, look,

163
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:22,040
there's Chris Rock and, you know, and, and, and, and Tiesto, and here's the cool DJs. And,

164
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:27,080
and then you had people at Burning Man also reading these things, and then also commenting.

165
00:16:27,640 --> 00:16:34,760
And, and the amount of psychic energy that was devoted to making sense of what was a few rainy

166
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:43,320
days was completely out of proportion with that and being a NASCAR race, or a football stadium,

167
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:48,920
or, you know, a stamp collector's convention or anything. And so it is, I think, super interesting

168
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:56,120
that how we hold notions of bliss, pleasure, joy, liberation,

169
00:16:57,560 --> 00:17:08,120
directly affect our, our willingness, our tolerance, our curiosity, and our positioning,

170
00:17:08,120 --> 00:17:14,920
because radical, whatever, you know, radical joy, radical awareness, radical freedom,

171
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:22,600
is rarely in a vacuum and rarely without other people having strong opinions

172
00:17:24,040 --> 00:17:29,480
about how it can and should go down. Wow, I love everything you just said. I have

173
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:33,320
quite a few thoughts. My first thing is I don't want to make this about me, but

174
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:39,160
at Burning Man, Brian Morescu went there and people were very inspired by the video we made

175
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:45,000
together on the Elusinian Mysteries and the, the great psychedelic secret and that whole ritual.

176
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:51,000
So they built an entire section of Burning Man based on the idea that if you die before you die,

177
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:57,320
you don't die. And that was written on this giant cup. It was massive. That was the Kukion cup.

178
00:17:58,120 --> 00:18:03,560
And they took, I don't know, like 10,000 drones and they put them up in the sky and they programmed

179
00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:11,640
them to create the images that I had drawn in our video, which just blew my mind, blew my mind.

180
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:19,800
This was funded by the musk family. It was Kimble and Christiana. Right. Yeah. I don't know them,

181
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:25,560
but I was just, when I saw the pictures of the drones making this DNA tree that I love to draw,

182
00:18:25,560 --> 00:18:31,240
I was like, that's insane. So that's one thing you reminded me of, which I think is really cool

183
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:36,600
how this, this secret of the Elusinian Mysteries, it still lives on and it, and it's like, it still

184
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:43,160
captivates us, you know? And then one thing you made me think of is like, can humans handle

185
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:49,720
these very potent, powerful substances without these ancient rituals attached to them? Like,

186
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:55,080
it seems like if you just take all the barriers down and you just give people these really powerful

187
00:18:55,080 --> 00:19:00,840
agents, sometimes they can't handle them and you look at cities that have made all drugs legal

188
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:06,360
and it kind of didn't work in some ways, you know? You can't give people ultimate freedom

189
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:13,640
without accountability. Are you seeing that? Yeah, but I think to quote the great philosopher,

190
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:20,280
Homer Simpson, you know, he was like short answer, yes with an and long answer, no with a but,

191
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:25,400
you know, I mean, the bottom line, I mean, there's a couple of things. If you're referring

192
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:31,480
specifically to current U.S. cities efforts like Portland and Oregon and those kind of things and

193
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:36,920
even Vancouver and those sort of things to decriminalize drugs, you could also potentially

194
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:43,480
look to Portugal and a few other places in the world, you know, I think it's essential to differentiate

195
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:49,240
or disambiguate between different classes of chemicals because they are radically different

196
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:56,440
in their in both impact, user experience, pro-social white indoor health benefits or detriments.

197
00:19:57,320 --> 00:20:02,920
So the fact that folks were trying to do that, especially in North America, you know, in the

198
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:10,200
last decade and quite and in the midst of both a quarantine lockdown crisis of public and mental

199
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:17,480
and social health, as well as an opioid, you know, starting with oxy, going into street heroin,

200
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:24,680
going into fentanyl, you're like, okay, those are not, that's not a cognitive liberty argument.

201
00:20:25,560 --> 00:20:30,040
And in fact, I was on stage speaking of Benningman, I was giving a talk at MAPS

202
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:35,160
with Rick Doblin and Carl, gosh, what is Carl's last name?

203
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:42,920
Hart? Carl Hart. Yes. Carl Hart, right? Who is who is that? I believe he's at Columbia.

204
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:51,400
And he is a very strong cognitive libertarian, basically the idea that people should be free

205
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:56,840
to consume anything they'd like. He's also quite infamously, as he, you know, wrote in his own

206
00:20:56,840 --> 00:21:03,640
books, a high functioning opioid user. So, you know, the thing there is like, you can, you know,

207
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:08,120
motivated reasoning, you know, there is an element where he's like, of course, you're going to argue

208
00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:13,800
to be left alone to do the thing that you like to do, and may or may not be able to, you know,

209
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:26,680
stop or start at will, right? But the urban situations does lead you to question how safe,

210
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:35,000
stable, prosocial are accessed to these tools and techniques. I've written in like my last book,

211
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:40,600
a suggested model of social psychedelic use, which would be a bell curve. And basically,

212
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:46,840
10% of the population, those with family histories of Doctriad personality, so narcissism,

213
00:21:46,840 --> 00:21:53,240
Machiavellianism, sociopathy, authoritarianism, schizophrenia, you know, borderline personality,

214
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:58,280
any number of situations where like, hey, your medical and or family history does not suggest

215
00:21:58,280 --> 00:22:03,560
this is a good role of the dice, so don't, right? That 10%, take those folks out.

216
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:12,840
Only 10% of the population should probably ever do them more than one, two or three times in their

217
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:17,640
entire life. And those could be sort of the psychonauts, test pilots, the cultural creators,

218
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:21,560
whatever those people are that self select and are willing to kind of learn and apprentice to the

219
00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:27,560
skill sets. And then, you know, the overwhelming majority in the middle, what would it look like

220
00:22:27,560 --> 00:22:32,200
to do what you suggested, which is reintegrate these state experiences within a initiatory

221
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:37,560
culture of ritual framework, aka the anthropology, the neuro anthropology of it. And you can make

222
00:22:37,560 --> 00:22:44,680
a case then if you're like, okay, well, how have civilizations, how have societies made use of

223
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:51,640
hardship or deal, initiation and access to transcendence, vision quest, rights of passage,

224
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:54,760
all those kind of things. So you can make a case, hey, first one kind of makes sense.

225
00:22:55,480 --> 00:23:01,720
And the right of passage from adolescence to adulthood, right, that that great, very famous

226
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:06,920
book by Alex Haley that then became I think the most watched mini series ever roots, right,

227
00:23:06,920 --> 00:23:11,080
which was about the African diaspora and the slave trade. But back in Ghana, I think it was,

228
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:16,040
you know, Kuntakinte is the lead, you know, he's the kind of the hero that makes his way

229
00:23:16,040 --> 00:23:21,880
through the story. But as a baby, he is born in West Africa, and his father holds them up to

230
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:28,360
this incredible Milky Way night sky. And he says, behold, Kuntakinte, the only thing in the universe

231
00:23:28,360 --> 00:23:34,760
greater than you. Right. And it's this beautiful, like, like, welcome to the world kind of moment.

232
00:23:34,760 --> 00:23:39,560
And here's your place in things. Here's your place against the vast and the infinite, the Milky Way,

233
00:23:39,560 --> 00:23:44,440
the night sky, here's your place in your family, here's your place in your community. And so

234
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:49,960
picturing that, you know, fast forward 15 years, picturing that as our initiation for young men

235
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:55,880
and young women into adulthood, because right now we've got failure to launch, we've got kids

236
00:23:55,960 --> 00:24:01,880
kicking the can down the road on an extended adolescence, right, until they're 30, which is,

237
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:06,680
I think, arguably, a little too long. You know, it's like, I'm just going to smoke weed and jerk

238
00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:10,920
off to porn and play first person shooter games in my parents' basement, and then become an angry

239
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:15,640
incel, you know, because I don't have a snatched jawline like all the chads who are snagging all

240
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:22,120
the stasis, you're like, that's wildly dysfunctional. You know, and so what we need, you need

241
00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:27,160
moments of effective initiation that actually are transformational. They're not as Michael

242
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:33,480
Pollan called them placebo sacraments, right, you actually need the real deal, so that if I pass

243
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:41,080
through that threshold, I am no longer the same person, my relationship and obligation to the

244
00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:45,080
world is not the same. So authentic initiatory rites of passage, and you know, folks have been

245
00:24:45,080 --> 00:24:49,000
talking about that, that's not a particularly profound insight, it's just pronounced on how

246
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:55,480
absent they are. And the next one could arguably be marriage, right, so picture, you know, and if

247
00:24:55,480 --> 00:24:59,720
you wanted to get really down into the details and programming, right, you could be like, oh,

248
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:05,240
that initiatory rite of passage could be three grams of psilocybin, or it could be a functional

249
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:11,400
ayahuasca experience or something along those lines, right, slow enough, not acutely intense enough

250
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:16,680
to just scramble you, you know, like DMT or like five MEO or something like something along those

251
00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:21,640
lines, but you know, a real, you know, like the world's enchanted and magical, you know, and I'm

252
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:28,600
being and seeing that, right, so that is an initiatory process. For partners and couples, and you

253
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:34,440
know, maps has been parallel tracking this, which is MDMA as couples therapy. So imagine if, you

254
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:38,200
know, instead of sort of sitting with your rabbi or sitting with your priest or whoever the sort of

255
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:43,400
minister of your ceremony would be beforehand as a young couple, you know, like a happy couple to

256
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:47,560
be, what are you guys going to do? What are your commitments? What are your obligations? What might

257
00:25:47,560 --> 00:25:55,480
it be like for them to take MDMA together? And with some form of guidance or facilitation, right,

258
00:25:55,480 --> 00:25:59,800
it could just simply be loving friends and family, it could be a minister, it could be whatever, to

259
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:06,040
actually speak their deepest hopes and fears for and their pledging of their love for each other

260
00:26:06,760 --> 00:26:13,480
in a way that marriage then became that communion, not simply, oh, we got a Williams and Sonoma

261
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:17,400
guest list and please make sure we get enough linens to match our silverware, you know, and there

262
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:22,280
we are, you know, doing our destination wedding for the gram, you know, like all of these super

263
00:26:22,280 --> 00:26:28,280
hyper superficial things that don't carry you through the doldrums, don't carry you through the,

264
00:26:28,280 --> 00:26:31,720
we've got two kids under the age of three and we've been sleepless for six months and I, you

265
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:35,720
know, and I don't even know who I am anymore, let alone who you are anymore, and this doesn't

266
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:42,920
feel fun anymore, you know, and couples just drifting under the burden of being householders

267
00:26:42,920 --> 00:26:48,200
together, which is, you know, which is an unmitigated son of a bitch, if you don't have, you know,

268
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:54,040
the other things that come with deep connection and potential communion. And then the obvious final

269
00:26:54,040 --> 00:27:01,000
one is just end of life. What might it mean, there I am, you know, sliding off this mortal coil

270
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:07,480
and really whatever, you know, I mean, there's so many stories of either staunch atheists who then

271
00:27:07,480 --> 00:27:13,640
get religion at the end, you know, or devout believers who then doubt everything or whatever it

272
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:21,000
might be, but basically facing the reaper is a great equalizer on whatever worldviews or philosophies

273
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:26,680
you played through, you know, the rest of your life with and an experience like, and again, this is

274
00:27:26,680 --> 00:27:34,040
all wildly open to interpretation and curation, but you know, an experience like 5MDMT, which many

275
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:41,720
participants do report is as close as anyone can imagine to a near death experience of sort of,

276
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:47,160
you know, brilliant white light encounter with source consciousness, you're like, oh, okay,

277
00:27:47,160 --> 00:27:53,320
many people who have had that experience prior to dying, go out of their way to mention, I'm no

278
00:27:53,320 --> 00:27:57,960
longer so afraid of my physical death. I know what's on the other side, I've had a quick sneak peek

279
00:27:57,960 --> 00:28:05,880
preview. And so imagine that and not just by itself, like, oh, let's just get grandpa loaded to, you

280
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:10,760
know, and put him in front of some, you know, immersive VR and see what happens, but much more

281
00:28:10,760 --> 00:28:16,920
like, hey, grandma grandpa, here is this sacred experience, you get to peek around the corner

282
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:23,800
of where your path is going soon. And then you get to come back and now, potentially with guided

283
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:30,200
therapy with, you know, again, family facilitation, what is it that you'd like to share? What are the

284
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:34,520
places to make amends? What are the truths you want to pass on to your grandchildren? What are the

285
00:28:34,520 --> 00:28:39,480
heartfelt things you want to share with your own kids? You know, and so we could really reintegrate

286
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:46,840
disassociated teens and bring them across the threshold into adulthood, partnership in union,

287
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:53,000
which, you know, you don't have to be a sort of card carrying conservative to just acknowledge

288
00:28:53,000 --> 00:29:00,360
that, hey, as parents come together to make more children and further our nation, our communities,

289
00:29:00,360 --> 00:29:06,600
our species, having them be happy and connected is generally a better thing than having them

290
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:12,680
alienated and fragmented. And then end of life. I mean, you know, and Baby Boomers have kind of

291
00:29:12,680 --> 00:29:18,440
led the way every, every stage of their own development, you know, the famous kind of me

292
00:29:18,440 --> 00:29:21,480
generation, you know, when they were young, they were all about personal growth and development

293
00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:24,200
and transcendence. And then they were in their middle years, and they were all about making

294
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:28,440
bank and, you know, money and kind of Wall Street greed is good kind of thing. And now they're

295
00:29:28,440 --> 00:29:35,240
shuffling off the coil. So there's naturally, this is a great time to revisit our end of life

296
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:41,480
rituals and ceremonies. And compared to, hey, grandma or grandpa, we found them off to a nursing

297
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:45,800
home five years ago, because it just got too difficult, you know, and now we are paying

298
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:50,680
exorbitant amounts of money to these companies who hire minimum wage employees who dope grandma

299
00:29:50,680 --> 00:29:56,520
grandpa to the gills, you know, on sedatives, you know, whatever it is to keep them docile and

300
00:29:56,520 --> 00:30:02,440
manageable. And they die, you know, and we maybe we guiltily, you know, obligingly show up around

301
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:08,520
their bed when it's when the time is getting really close, but they're often out of it. And

302
00:30:08,520 --> 00:30:12,280
they die under fluorescent lights, hooked up to tubes, and you're like, Oh my God,

303
00:30:12,920 --> 00:30:18,680
like we can do so much better than that. Just from a heartfelt human sense, but also even just from

304
00:30:18,680 --> 00:30:26,280
sort of clinical and therapeutic outcomes sense. So that to me, would be a really meaningful

305
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:33,960
wrapper that culturally and interrelationally and communally, we sort of can and ought

306
00:30:34,760 --> 00:30:40,760
to include in these peak states and experiences because the downside of the maps medicalization

307
00:30:40,760 --> 00:30:44,920
model, which was a very strategic tactical thing, which is like, let's make this respectable,

308
00:30:44,920 --> 00:30:48,440
let's make this legit, let's go through all the proper channels and let's speak in the language

309
00:30:48,440 --> 00:30:52,760
of mainstream dominant society. So they actually understand and can validate what we believe is

310
00:30:52,760 --> 00:30:58,920
to be true and precious about these experiences, aka PTSD, depression, smoking, smoking cessation,

311
00:30:58,920 --> 00:31:04,280
anxiety, right? All the, all the kitchen sink stuff that has been laid at the feet of the

312
00:31:04,280 --> 00:31:09,480
psychedelic experience, and instead be like, look, guys, those, those are epiphenomena.

313
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:16,200
You know, those are little bells and whistles that may or may not be improved by an encounter

314
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:21,080
with the numinous. But can we actually just sort of let the mystery stay the mystery? Can we actually

315
00:31:21,080 --> 00:31:28,840
just say, Hey, these experiences seem to somewhat reliably gain us access to non ordinary states

316
00:31:28,840 --> 00:31:34,840
of being where there is a certain sacredness, suchness, magic, mystery, you know, insight,

317
00:31:34,840 --> 00:31:39,720
delight, aesthetic appreciation, you know, take your pick as to which of those things, you know,

318
00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:47,560
you want to hang your hat on and then just say, Hey, we can't and we shouldn't try and pin that down

319
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:55,080
to the 17th decimal place. That kills it. You know, and it reminds me of that. There's an old

320
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:58,760
joke. I think I think Mark Twain used to tell it, but like the web, like probably not because this

321
00:31:58,760 --> 00:32:05,560
is too, too recent a story that the plot is there's a biologist checking to see how far frogs, frogs

322
00:32:05,560 --> 00:32:09,320
can jump and he gives them different commands. And he's like, Oh, a frog, you know, a frog,

323
00:32:09,320 --> 00:32:13,160
when given the command to jump will jump 10 centimeters. And then he takes an exacto knife,

324
00:32:13,160 --> 00:32:16,520
you know, a little scalpel, lops off one leg. And he's like, And then when I gave the frog

325
00:32:16,520 --> 00:32:20,680
another command to jump, yeah, he only jumped seven and a half centimeters. And then I chopped off

326
00:32:20,680 --> 00:32:24,360
another leg and gave him the command to jump. And he only jumped five centimeters. And then,

327
00:32:24,360 --> 00:32:27,880
you know, I cut off his final leg and gave him the command to jump and nothing happened.

328
00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:34,920
So I now conclude that a frog with no legs is deaf. And you do and you kind of think that's

329
00:32:34,920 --> 00:32:43,160
sort of how our, you know, again, big pharma double blind placebo controlled DSM five correlate

330
00:32:43,960 --> 00:32:48,600
psychedelic research is, you're just like, Do you guys know even what you're looking at?

331
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:53,320
Or are you all pretending that there is not this magical mystical

332
00:32:53,320 --> 00:32:58,680
initiatory experience behind those doors? And we're just sort of all sort of that that's,

333
00:32:58,680 --> 00:33:06,200
that's the, in some respects, that's the, that's the scam is we're all pretending that there's

334
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:11,160
no magic and mystery there. And if we all stay on that hymn book of like incongenity,

335
00:33:11,160 --> 00:33:16,040
such and such, such and such in conjunction with clinical therapy, you know, is going to result

336
00:33:16,040 --> 00:33:20,120
in all of these outcomes, but it's a little like that, you know, Hunter Thompson's fear and loathing

337
00:33:20,120 --> 00:33:24,520
in Las Vegas, you know, like, you know, we were somewhere outside of Boston when the drugs began

338
00:33:24,520 --> 00:33:27,800
to kick in, right? And then famously, they're driving along that Cadillac and then they pick

339
00:33:27,800 --> 00:33:31,960
up the hitchhiker, you know, and Hunter's peaking. And he's like, When are we going to tell him

340
00:33:31,960 --> 00:33:36,680
about the bats? You know, don't worry, the poor bastard will see him soon enough himself, you

341
00:33:36,680 --> 00:33:44,360
know, and you kind of think that to me, that's, that's the shadow side of the conventional

342
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:51,000
pharmacological medicalization and VC corporate, you know, experience of this quote on quote,

343
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:57,320
psychedelic red renaissance is we're going to get Prozac Nation 2.0 with new and improved

344
00:33:57,320 --> 00:34:05,720
five HT 2a receptor sites, you know, versus anything, but I mean, just imagine if 30 years

345
00:34:05,720 --> 00:34:12,440
ago we'd gone down the religious liberty route and had said, Hey, placebo sacraments suck,

346
00:34:13,160 --> 00:34:21,800
you know, and we as humans deserve cultural communal encounters and renewal for healing

347
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:30,920
and inspiration of the mystery. And that's our birthright. Not I deserve a copay for a coded illness

348
00:34:30,920 --> 00:34:36,440
for my worried wellness of tired, wired, stressed and anxious. And I've heard that this new magic

349
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:43,880
pill might allow me to keep going as one more how slightly better adjusted cog in the neoliberal

350
00:34:43,880 --> 00:34:51,320
machine. Wow, you just said a lot of things that are that kind of I'm going to have to

351
00:34:51,320 --> 00:34:55,240
sit and reflect on everything you just said and rewatch that clip because that yeah,

352
00:34:56,760 --> 00:35:03,480
well said, well said. And I've jotted down quite a few notes, but I think on a on a grand level,

353
00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:10,120
you made me think of this progress narrative that we've been given that if you're really

354
00:35:10,120 --> 00:35:14,680
materialist in your thinking, things are just getting better and better and better. We have

355
00:35:14,680 --> 00:35:22,520
more stuff. Everybody has a bigger flat screen TV. They often point to metrics like life expectancies

356
00:35:22,520 --> 00:35:29,160
longer, child infant mortality is lower. Look at all our pharmaceuticals, look at our health

357
00:35:29,160 --> 00:35:34,280
industry, look at how much food people have. And they say that's a progress narrative. Is that

358
00:35:34,280 --> 00:35:41,560
progress narrative a lie? Yeah, I mean, that's such a good question. That's literally the subject

359
00:35:41,560 --> 00:35:51,880
of my next book. And I'm so I'm deep into the research right now. And I mean, I think the only

360
00:35:51,880 --> 00:35:56,600
honest answer and I actually had this conversation with Daniel Schmackenberger several years ago,

361
00:35:56,600 --> 00:36:02,360
it just hasn't, you know, the foundational conditions are the same, which is is that

362
00:36:03,320 --> 00:36:09,240
for most of us right now, it's bafflingly confusing to figure out kind of quote unquote,

363
00:36:09,240 --> 00:36:15,320
what's really going on? Because when you do see Hans Rosling or Steven Pinker or, you know,

364
00:36:15,320 --> 00:36:22,200
pick your favorite Ted talk, you're like, Oh, my gosh, you know, this is the most peaceful we've

365
00:36:22,200 --> 00:36:26,760
ever been. This is the most people living above the poverty line. This is, you know, just the

366
00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:33,000
litany of public health statistics that are suggesting this is the best of times. And then

367
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:37,960
you end up either on an environmental channel or just doom scrolling your news feed. And you become

368
00:36:37,960 --> 00:36:44,120
very quickly convinced, Oh, no, we are going off the cliff with no skid marks, you know, to our doom,

369
00:36:44,120 --> 00:36:49,160
and we probably deserve it. You know, like, look how many dumb, terrible, stupid ass things we're

370
00:36:49,160 --> 00:36:55,080
doing, we deserve what's coming. Like, and so things are getting exponentially worse and getting

371
00:36:55,080 --> 00:37:02,360
exponentially better at precisely the same moment. And Oh, by the way, this super advanced techno

372
00:37:02,360 --> 00:37:07,560
industrial society with pronounced civil liberties and incredible hyper mobility and access to the

373
00:37:07,560 --> 00:37:12,520
world's information, you know, is also the very same container that is allowing us to do all these

374
00:37:12,520 --> 00:37:17,880
personal growth and healing and waking up experiences. Right. And so you sort of you wake up,

375
00:37:17,880 --> 00:37:23,080
and then you're like, Oh, my God, wait, when did I wake up? I woke up now in this moment. I mean,

376
00:37:23,080 --> 00:37:30,440
I had that experience going skiing in Colorado a few years ago. And it was a spring skiing and

377
00:37:30,440 --> 00:37:38,520
we're rolling into town and everything was melting. Right. And it was early, like it was it

378
00:37:38,520 --> 00:37:44,360
felt like May and it was actually mid March. And you know, there was muddy waters down the streets

379
00:37:44,360 --> 00:37:48,520
and there was grass and straw showing around, you know, and there we are riding this lift and

380
00:37:48,520 --> 00:37:54,200
they just, you know, having lived most of our life in Colorado and knowing the history of the ski

381
00:37:54,200 --> 00:37:58,040
industry, you're like, Holy shit. So I'm riding this lift and I'm watching everything melt around

382
00:37:58,040 --> 00:38:01,800
us and being like, Hmm, I don't know how much longer the ski industry is going to be a thing.

383
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:07,960
And then thinking, Wow, this ski industry was the direct byproduct of the military industrial

384
00:38:07,960 --> 00:38:13,480
complex. The 10th Mountain Division had trained just over the hills from us. They went to Italy,

385
00:38:13,480 --> 00:38:17,960
fought in the Alps. They all came back from the Alps, started Veil, started Aspen, started Sun Valley.

386
00:38:18,440 --> 00:38:23,880
Right. The skis, we the skis and snowboards we ski on have advanced petrochemical, P tech

387
00:38:23,880 --> 00:38:27,320
spaces that are super slidey with metal edges and all these things when flex patterns and all

388
00:38:27,320 --> 00:38:33,160
this kind of stuff that the lifts and all the steel and all the all the things. Right. The very

389
00:38:33,160 --> 00:38:41,000
techno industrial war mongering society that made this possible of like little monkeys sliding

390
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:46,760
down white stuff in the mountains for fun is also the very thing that's also melting this

391
00:38:46,760 --> 00:38:53,400
planet's atmosphere. Right. And so that was just a tiny example of what we're experiencing globally

392
00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:59,560
and at scale right now, which is that our awareness has gone through the roof at the same time that

393
00:38:59,560 --> 00:39:06,760
what we need to be paying attention to or be made aware of is that the very same culture that has

394
00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:16,760
birthed us is also threatening to kill us. And most people can't hold that cognitive dissonance.

395
00:39:16,760 --> 00:39:21,480
So we toggle between the coming alive arc of like, what's the infinite? You know, what's my

396
00:39:21,480 --> 00:39:27,880
hashtag best life? What's my optimum personal growth? What's the way do I want to go? Who do I

397
00:39:27,880 --> 00:39:32,840
want to be unlimited possibilities? And then also societally, you know, what is a world where

398
00:39:33,480 --> 00:39:37,160
any gender is welcome? What is a world of post-racial equality? What is a, you know,

399
00:39:37,160 --> 00:39:42,040
what is a realm where the bottom four billion of the global south have equity and inclusion? And

400
00:39:42,040 --> 00:39:48,120
we've made reparations for all the dirty, dirty deeds of the last 500 years, etc. Right. So that's

401
00:39:48,120 --> 00:39:53,160
that's the coming alive arc. And it's sort of, it's not time bound and it's not resource dependent.

402
00:39:53,160 --> 00:39:58,360
It's a sort of infinite open. What's the best thing we can possibly imagine and live into?

403
00:39:59,320 --> 00:40:04,200
And then that gets clipped by the staying alive arc, which is very time bound and very resource

404
00:40:04,200 --> 00:40:09,240
constrained. And it's like, Oh, shit, you know, should I have my money in fiat or crypto? Should

405
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:15,240
I get a, should I get an, you know, a golden passport in Portugal, you know, or maybe I've heard

406
00:40:15,240 --> 00:40:19,640
that St. Kitts is dishing them out, or do I need to get down to Mexico or do I hunker down in the

407
00:40:19,640 --> 00:40:25,880
US or do I fleet a Canada, right? Or those kinds of things. Or like, what do we do? Right with

408
00:40:25,880 --> 00:40:31,880
best places on the maps? I mean, a buddy of ours was, was it was an SVP at Google,

409
00:40:32,840 --> 00:40:38,280
who got super freaked out during, I think it was the 2018 California fires or maybe it was

410
00:40:38,280 --> 00:40:42,360
later than that actually, because it was during COVID, it was that super dystopian situation

411
00:40:42,360 --> 00:40:48,520
where families were like fleeing San Francisco to get to Tahoe, where they could see sky and their

412
00:40:48,520 --> 00:40:53,160
kids could breathe again in the midst of a pandemic with masks on, you're like, Oh my gosh, this is,

413
00:40:53,160 --> 00:40:56,600
you know, this is bleak, right? That wig them out to the point where he's like, Okay,

414
00:40:57,320 --> 00:41:02,200
California's off my list. I'm moving my family somewhere to be safe. And he did all the research

415
00:41:02,200 --> 00:41:06,280
being a, you know, an engineering quanti guy with the world's best search engines at his fingertips.

416
00:41:06,280 --> 00:41:11,800
And he concluded that Lahaina Maui was the safe place on an island in the middle of the Pacific

417
00:41:11,800 --> 00:41:17,480
in a tropical rainforest. And that's where he was going to post up. And he got clipped. Right with

418
00:41:17,480 --> 00:41:21,960
the Lahaina fires, which, you know, kind of reminds me of the, there's again, an old Greek story of

419
00:41:22,920 --> 00:41:29,800
someone going to the Oracle at Delphi and being told, tomorrow you will, you will die. And he

420
00:41:29,800 --> 00:41:35,800
flees Athens for spotter. He's like, Oh, fuck that noise. I'm getting out of dodge. And then

421
00:41:35,800 --> 00:41:41,960
runs into the Reaper in a crowd in spotter. And he's shocked. And he's like, What are you doing?

422
00:41:41,960 --> 00:41:47,560
And he's like, I was waiting for you. So that notion for all of us these days that there's sort

423
00:41:47,640 --> 00:41:55,800
of, there is no a way. And it's on us to pick our spot to make our stand and then get on with living

424
00:41:55,800 --> 00:42:02,360
through this feels like an important part of how do we reconcile that impossible contradiction of

425
00:42:02,360 --> 00:42:06,280
things are exponentially better and worse at the same time? And where do I even map that? Right?

426
00:42:06,280 --> 00:42:09,560
I mean, I think if you think, if you've heard, in fact, I guess people have heard of it because

427
00:42:09,560 --> 00:42:14,280
it's called the three body problem is isn't that that the new HBO show, right with the Game of

428
00:42:14,280 --> 00:42:20,200
Thrones guys, I think it is, but anyway, the three body problem refers to in astronomy slash

429
00:42:20,200 --> 00:42:25,480
physics, it's very, very hard to map and model is one thing to map like the moon going around the

430
00:42:25,480 --> 00:42:30,280
earth. But when you throw in the sun and the moon and the earth and where all things are in

431
00:42:30,280 --> 00:42:37,880
relationships to each other, it gets herdy, goody in a hurry. And we've got an eight billion body

432
00:42:37,880 --> 00:42:43,960
problem, all agentic little egos bouncing around each other. So how on earth we map them

433
00:42:45,160 --> 00:42:53,160
leads to cognitive shorting out leads to emotional psychological overwhelm and leads to

434
00:42:54,040 --> 00:43:00,760
boatloads of grief, as we potentially run all the traps run the numbers and come to the conclusion

435
00:43:00,760 --> 00:43:08,840
that the world as we have known it might not actually be as stable or foreordained or given

436
00:43:08,840 --> 00:43:15,240
or even, you know, predictably carrying forwards as we might have thought, as we might have hoped,

437
00:43:15,240 --> 00:43:22,520
as we might have been led to believe. So how do we grieve in all of this? Also, you know, in a healthy

438
00:43:22,520 --> 00:43:29,640
way, you know, in a powerful way, in a way that leaves us cleansed and grounded and stronger and

439
00:43:29,640 --> 00:43:36,840
wiser versus in a way that leaves us kicking and screaming and embittered and feeling victimized

440
00:43:37,480 --> 00:43:42,600
feels like a super important part of what you know, what life might look like going forward or

441
00:43:42,600 --> 00:43:47,880
kind of part of the immune our immune systems. That will be really helpful for us to develop.

442
00:43:49,240 --> 00:43:54,040
Hmm. Well, part of that progress narrative is that technology is going to save us. And that's

443
00:43:54,040 --> 00:43:59,160
going to be our get out of jail free card. Do you think that we could develop some technology that

444
00:43:59,160 --> 00:44:05,000
fixes all our problems? Yeah, I mean, Mark Andreessen, right, of Andreessen Horowitz, you know,

445
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:10,840
famously, infamously wrote the techno optimist manifesto last year. And he was basically coming

446
00:44:10,840 --> 00:44:18,920
down hard on the side of technology progress is it has always been with God knows what's got us

447
00:44:18,920 --> 00:44:27,560
out of the last pickle. It is forever will be. And anybody who isn't for utterly unregulated

448
00:44:27,560 --> 00:44:32,360
affected, you know, the term that sort of showed up on Twitter is effective accelerationism,

449
00:44:33,080 --> 00:44:38,520
right, instead of effective altruism, right, the idea of just like pin it. Let's put every penny

450
00:44:38,520 --> 00:44:45,720
and every calorie and every gigawatt we've got into general artificial intelligence, basically a

451
00:44:45,720 --> 00:44:53,560
silicon God. And that'll fix it. Which, you know, if anybody's seen, you read the stories of Dr.

452
00:44:53,560 --> 00:44:59,240
Faustus or seen Fantasia with Mickey and the Sorcerer's Apprentice, you know, or any countless,

453
00:44:59,240 --> 00:45:06,280
countless tale where humans are tempted to go for ultimate power or knowledge, right, and they try

454
00:45:06,280 --> 00:45:10,520
and grab for that ring, you know, there's not a single story where that one comes up roses.

455
00:45:11,080 --> 00:45:16,840
So there's a lot in our kind of mythical memory, as well as our historical memory of, you know,

456
00:45:16,840 --> 00:45:23,000
all we ever do is kick the can down the road to greater, more complex, wicked problems from

457
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:28,360
solving our earlier ones. You know, and some of the classics would be, oh, you know, London fog,

458
00:45:28,360 --> 00:45:32,280
right, London fog was because we were burning too much coal. And then we discovered, you know,

459
00:45:32,280 --> 00:45:37,800
quote unquote, cleaner burning diesel and hydrocarbons fossil fuels, actually liquid fuels,

460
00:45:37,800 --> 00:45:42,760
that was much better London London fog as a pollution went away. The, you know, New York and

461
00:45:42,760 --> 00:45:47,480
Chicago and Paris and London were, you know, in the 1890s were up to their kneecaps and horseshocks

462
00:45:47,480 --> 00:45:52,360
of all the carriages. And then Henry Ford invented the Model T. See, look, we keep doing this,

463
00:45:52,360 --> 00:46:00,840
right. And so there are these really well worn tropes about what is our direction does is there

464
00:46:00,840 --> 00:46:05,800
a teleological thrust, meaning is there a point or a purpose to where we're going. And then all the

465
00:46:05,800 --> 00:46:11,480
stories of progress are yes, it's high into the right, right, the curve goes up, and we're on

466
00:46:11,480 --> 00:46:18,760
times arrow, it's going someplace, which really wasn't, you know, wasn't argue arguably, that is

467
00:46:18,760 --> 00:46:25,000
a highly Judeo Christian concept, right. It's not until the Hebrew and Christian sacred scriptures

468
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:29,640
had an alpha and had an alpha in the beginning was the word and the word was good, right,

469
00:46:30,280 --> 00:46:35,720
and an omega, an endpoint that we actually got to have connect two dots on a line and create

470
00:46:35,720 --> 00:46:40,920
times arrow. Now, there's all sorts of reasons, you'll your pregine, the Nobel laureate and

471
00:46:40,920 --> 00:46:44,920
physics and others have, you know, played with, you know, what, what is the notion of times

472
00:46:44,920 --> 00:46:50,520
arrow, not just as a cultural story, but as potentially a deep code of physical reality,

473
00:46:50,520 --> 00:46:55,560
aka you can't unscramble an omelet, those kind of things, there's certain appearances of

474
00:46:55,560 --> 00:47:00,680
directionality that breaks down at a quantum level. And and pregine actually had another

475
00:47:01,880 --> 00:47:05,400
really meaningful contribution to this, so just to be clear, so we're talking about Mark

476
00:47:05,400 --> 00:47:09,800
Andreessen posting something on, you know, effective altruism or effective accelerationism,

477
00:47:09,800 --> 00:47:14,120
we're talking about the sort of tried and true progress narrative. And now we're kind of kicking

478
00:47:14,120 --> 00:47:20,040
it down to well, what's true at the base levels of reality. And pregine advanced this notion of

479
00:47:20,040 --> 00:47:25,480
complex dissipative structures, and that a complex dissipative structure could be a human, like we,

480
00:47:26,040 --> 00:47:31,800
talking, breathing, loving, writing poetry, doing whatever, we're far more complex than the 28

481
00:47:31,800 --> 00:47:36,520
minerals and elements that make up our bodies, right. And when we die, we go back to decomposing

482
00:47:36,520 --> 00:47:41,640
and pushing up daisies, and that is a less complex state than we were when we were alive. So a human

483
00:47:41,640 --> 00:47:47,720
is a complex dissipative structure, when we need constant inputs of energy, aka food and water,

484
00:47:47,720 --> 00:47:53,800
or we die, right, and that's the dissipating part. And so are civilizations. And the more

485
00:47:53,800 --> 00:47:58,680
complex our civilizations get, the more energy they need to keep them going without collapsing.

486
00:47:58,680 --> 00:48:02,840
And of course, as we're contemplating for the first time in human history, a transition from

487
00:48:02,840 --> 00:48:08,680
burning ever denser carbon, right, in fact, West Jackson, who's at the Land Institute in

488
00:48:08,680 --> 00:48:12,760
Salina, Kansas, he's one of the great kind of environmental and ecologists, he's a sort of

489
00:48:12,760 --> 00:48:16,920
contemporary of Wendell Berry. He said something interesting, he said, basically, you can make

490
00:48:16,920 --> 00:48:24,200
a case that all of human civilization is just the hunt for ever denser carbon, and ever hotter fire,

491
00:48:25,080 --> 00:48:29,480
right. So from like rubbing sticks together, you know, and just burning up trees and twigs,

492
00:48:29,480 --> 00:48:36,200
and that kind of stuff, to ceramics and kilns, like now we can actually cure Earth in a

493
00:48:36,200 --> 00:48:40,920
waterproof, bugproof storage container for our grains. So now we can take starlight

494
00:48:40,920 --> 00:48:45,720
in the form of photosynthesis and grain production, and we can bend time, right,

495
00:48:45,720 --> 00:48:50,520
by keeping it in pots. And then the Bronze Age, oh my gosh, if we dig up some of this stuff, we'd

496
00:48:50,520 --> 00:48:55,800
dig up tin and copper, and we put it in a hot enough fire, we can make bronze, that's amazing.

497
00:48:55,800 --> 00:48:59,720
We have swords and poke people and beat the shit out of the people that don't have

498
00:48:59,720 --> 00:49:04,280
sharper, pokey things. And so then you get into the Iron Age, oh my gosh, even better.

499
00:49:04,360 --> 00:49:10,120
And then all the way into the Silicon Age, we can melt sand, turn it into glass, turn it into

500
00:49:10,120 --> 00:49:15,160
lenses, turn it into silicon chips. But at 1500 degrees, right, all the way to like the Large

501
00:49:15,160 --> 00:49:21,800
Hadron Collider, where we have the light and heat of our sun. So we're forever hunting hotter fire

502
00:49:21,800 --> 00:49:26,680
to heat ever more dense and interesting star stuff, to our own benefit and advantage.

503
00:49:27,640 --> 00:49:32,120
Which, back to Prigagine, and the notion of complex dissipative structures, right,

504
00:49:32,200 --> 00:49:39,000
is the idea that he makes the case, and other physicists and writers who've kind of built

505
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:47,000
on his work since, is that our complexity, our civilization, all the cool stuff that we like

506
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:54,760
to think of as, you know, human, isn't actually random. It's actually a very, very elegant way

507
00:49:54,760 --> 00:49:58,840
of the universe reconciling the second law of thermodynamics, a.k.a. all things tend to

508
00:49:58,840 --> 00:50:02,600
entropy over time. Because if you're in that camp, you're like, oh, we're just, we're just

509
00:50:02,600 --> 00:50:08,200
random fluctuations where we shouldn't be here, roll the dice a million times more and we wouldn't

510
00:50:08,200 --> 00:50:14,440
be here, right? There is no point or purpose. We're an accident of randomized genetic mutation,

511
00:50:14,440 --> 00:50:20,920
right? There's definitely that camp, right? Prigagine would say, hey, yes, it's true that the

512
00:50:20,920 --> 00:50:26,520
universe tends towards the heat, you know, heat death, right, and a complete unspooling of all

513
00:50:26,520 --> 00:50:31,640
order and complexity over time. But wouldn't you know it? A complex dissipated structure is actually

514
00:50:31,640 --> 00:50:37,560
the universe's best way to get to entropy in the end. So if you take an example of like, if there's,

515
00:50:37,560 --> 00:50:42,920
if, you know, your bathtub is filled with water, and then it needs to drain all the way to daylight,

516
00:50:42,920 --> 00:50:46,760
you know, through your basement, through your pipes out to the stream or the river, right?

517
00:50:46,760 --> 00:50:51,880
Well, what does it do? It creates a whirlpool, which is a complex dissipated structure. It is one

518
00:50:51,880 --> 00:50:57,960
of the best ways to take an energy gradient of a ton of water, resisting gravity, you know,

519
00:50:57,960 --> 00:51:05,160
high to all the water going low and draining out. What's the best thing? Create a whirlpool

520
00:51:05,160 --> 00:51:09,240
to migrate it. The same thing with hurricanes, right? You've got a low pressure and a high pressure

521
00:51:09,240 --> 00:51:12,840
system. You've got someplace that's really cold and dense, and you've got someplace that's hot and

522
00:51:12,840 --> 00:51:18,120
light and it's, and if it's powerful enough, what does it do? It creates that giant whirlpool

523
00:51:18,120 --> 00:51:26,120
situation and it mixes, right? It very, very effectively mixes the energy gradient. It balances

524
00:51:26,120 --> 00:51:33,640
it. So if you're in that prigogene camp, you would say, hey, we are complex dissipated structures.

525
00:51:33,640 --> 00:51:41,560
We are enacting. So we have a purpose and it's a way to reconcile the second law of thermodynamics.

526
00:51:41,560 --> 00:51:49,080
This all ends in the ditch, right? With the goodness, truth and beauty that may emerge,

527
00:51:49,080 --> 00:51:56,120
right, in us and we're not just random accidents. We are actually agents centered in the bigger and

528
00:51:56,120 --> 00:52:03,880
greater unfolding of universal physical and energetic processes. So now let's go back to,

529
00:52:03,880 --> 00:52:08,680
because that's just kind of like, that's a nerdy sidebar, but I think it's super important because

530
00:52:08,680 --> 00:52:14,440
if you're just dealing with like warring, like Twitter wars, like Mark Andreessen and the EX

531
00:52:14,440 --> 00:52:18,920
versus the degrowth or D cell haters, and you just piss in a pissing match at that level,

532
00:52:20,120 --> 00:52:28,520
we're not necessarily kind of taking in the whole context and getting beyond opinions and into

533
00:52:29,240 --> 00:52:39,800
outlooks that are potentially rooted in more deeply structural reality. So, right, the reality

534
00:52:39,800 --> 00:52:47,000
of, hey, is technology going to save us, right, is the way forwards even faster, right, the folks

535
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:50,520
that are like, again, like Mark Andreessen, he has a great phrase, he said, we're teaching sand to

536
00:52:50,520 --> 00:52:54,680
think, right, and that's what we're doing with artificial general intelligence. And you can make

537
00:52:54,680 --> 00:52:59,080
a case like, are we just being carbon based life form chauvinist? Is it just because we're

538
00:52:59,080 --> 00:53:02,920
carbon based life forms? And everything else we know on this planet is carbon based that we

539
00:53:02,920 --> 00:53:07,720
somehow have a prejudice, like we're special and unique, and we're the honest and good and true,

540
00:53:07,720 --> 00:53:12,920
but silicon based consciousness is somehow an abomination, and we should prosecute it and shut

541
00:53:12,920 --> 00:53:18,760
it down. Like, that's an interesting question. You know, and that's where Larry Page has been,

542
00:53:18,760 --> 00:53:22,680
that that was the rift between him and Elon, where he was basically, you know, he accused Elon

543
00:53:22,680 --> 00:53:26,760
famously of being a speciesist, you know, like you actually, you know, Sam Altman has said,

544
00:53:28,040 --> 00:53:32,440
in fact, he came on right after us, giving a talk at Benningman, a couple of it was,

545
00:53:32,440 --> 00:53:36,840
it was like six months before ChatGPT launched, so it was before he, you know, he, his, his sort of

546
00:53:37,720 --> 00:53:42,760
recognizability had blown up to the level it is now. And he said, basically, there's only two

547
00:53:42,760 --> 00:53:48,840
options for humans, we either become cyborgs, meaning we're sort of like supplemented augmented,

548
00:53:48,840 --> 00:53:55,160
you know, but not just biological people anymore. Or we just become bootloaders to

549
00:53:55,160 --> 00:53:59,480
silicon consciousness. We're just the little monkeys with thumbs that were just clever,

550
00:53:59,480 --> 00:54:05,080
just clever enough to dig up all this stuff and heat hot fires, right, and make the silicon and

551
00:54:05,080 --> 00:54:11,800
organize a bunch of buried fossil fuels starlight and energy to pump into the grid until, you know,

552
00:54:11,800 --> 00:54:14,840
silicon consciousness could boot up and say, thanks very much, you clever little monkeys,

553
00:54:14,840 --> 00:54:19,800
we're now going to eliminate you, you know, or enslave you, you know, Allah, Skybot and the

554
00:54:19,800 --> 00:54:29,240
Matrix and everything else, or Skynet. Yeah, so, so I think there's a, you know, a very practical

555
00:54:29,240 --> 00:54:35,960
and real question, which is, can we decouple, like what, you know, Gwyneth Paltrow, I think,

556
00:54:35,960 --> 00:54:40,920
famously talked about conscious uncoupling, like for divorces that don't get nasty, right. And I think,

557
00:54:41,560 --> 00:54:46,440
for all of us, there's a question of what is conscious decoupling look like. And in this

558
00:54:46,440 --> 00:54:52,920
instance, it's, it's, can we decouple our carbon burn, right, from our quality of life?

559
00:54:54,360 --> 00:55:03,400
And if we can, then we buy the time and the, and the options to architect a more inclusive,

560
00:55:03,400 --> 00:55:10,120
more creative civilizational structure. And if we can't, then there's very real questions back to

561
00:55:10,120 --> 00:55:14,520
the degrowth side of the argument, which is like, Hey, no, actually, look, look at us, we're, we're,

562
00:55:14,520 --> 00:55:21,480
we're grossly obese, we're wildly unhappy. You know, Marie Kondo became a thing because there's,

563
00:55:21,480 --> 00:55:26,760
you know, $23 billion storage industry, like we have way too much stuff. And we literally have

564
00:55:26,760 --> 00:55:33,320
way too many calories hanging on our bodies, like clearly we've overshot some sweet spot,

565
00:55:33,320 --> 00:55:39,320
right, for quality of life versus energy bone. Even though that that even that statement

566
00:55:40,360 --> 00:55:44,520
seems surprisingly controversial, you'll still get slammed with being a degrowth or in a D cell,

567
00:55:44,520 --> 00:55:50,440
and you'll be accused of wanting to deny some poor starving, you know, grandmother in Africa or

568
00:55:50,440 --> 00:55:54,680
India, you know, denying her the right for her refrigerator and cell phone and air conditioning,

569
00:55:54,680 --> 00:55:59,000
you know, you're like, no, no, no, that's not what we're talking about. Right. But we are saying,

570
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:06,360
is there, is there a mark we've overshot on calorie burn versus the quote unquote good life?

571
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:13,720
And can we, because many of the sort of eco optimists and Hannah Ritchie is the most recent,

572
00:56:13,720 --> 00:56:17,080
she's at Oxford, and she just recently published a book, I think called It's Not the End of the

573
00:56:17,080 --> 00:56:22,920
World, but she's a protege of Hans Rosling and Max Roser at the Our World in Data project.

574
00:56:24,440 --> 00:56:27,960
You know, they're basically making the case of like, hey, guys, we can have everything.

575
00:56:28,760 --> 00:56:35,000
Right. Everybody can have, all we need to do is just heat pumps and Teslas, right. And we don't

576
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:42,360
need to back off on any of the stuff we've got. Right. And also some, you know, rhetorical play

577
00:56:42,360 --> 00:56:50,200
to that mother in Africa or India and giving her a chance of the good life too, which fundamentally

578
00:56:50,200 --> 00:56:57,880
is their own socializations of Simon Cousnets, the Nobel Prize winning economist who came up with

579
00:56:57,880 --> 00:57:03,160
GDP, but he also came up with something called the Cousnets curve. Right. And specific subset of

580
00:57:03,160 --> 00:57:07,880
the Cousnets curve is the EKC, the environmental Cousnets curve. And you've definitely heard this

581
00:57:07,880 --> 00:57:11,400
argument, even if you didn't know, that's what it was called. It was just basically that more

582
00:57:11,400 --> 00:57:17,160
advanced societies pollute less. Right. So that basically all of Europe and the United States,

583
00:57:17,160 --> 00:57:22,680
et cetera, we're on the happy far right side of the Cousnets curve. And we don't have, what would

584
00:57:22,680 --> 00:57:27,320
we do, but we just, we're not still building as many dirty coal power plants. We don't have people

585
00:57:27,320 --> 00:57:31,080
using diesel and kerosene heaters to heat their homes or we're going to cook their foods, et cetera,

586
00:57:31,080 --> 00:57:37,880
et cetera. So basically Ikea and Volvos and Tesla's good, you know, in Western Europe and the US

587
00:57:37,880 --> 00:57:45,960
and coal and kerosene, you know, in China and India bad. And the goal there, you silly humans,

588
00:57:45,960 --> 00:57:50,120
right, is to get everybody up and over the Cousnets curve as fast as possible. And any

589
00:57:50,120 --> 00:57:55,000
efforts to pump the brakes is wrong-headed, counterproductive, destructive and anti-human.

590
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:59,560
That's typically the argument. Right. Now, back to motivated reasoning, like we were talking about

591
00:57:59,560 --> 00:58:03,720
Karl Hart, the functioning opioid user slash professor, arguing for cognitive liberty and

592
00:58:03,720 --> 00:58:09,320
people getting to shoot up and do what they want to do. We are massively motivated to accept the

593
00:58:09,320 --> 00:58:17,400
argument and that sort of the almost religious dogma of the Cousnets curve because it gives us

594
00:58:17,400 --> 00:58:23,400
permission to keep doing exactly what we wanted to do anyway. Right. And the realities are there

595
00:58:23,400 --> 00:58:27,400
have been quite a bit of, there's been quite a bit of kind of, you know, replication studies and

596
00:58:27,400 --> 00:58:32,520
those kind of things on the Cousnets curve. It doesn't exist always. It's not a law of nature.

597
00:58:32,520 --> 00:58:36,840
It was most pronounced at a very specific time and place, which was post World War II in Western

598
00:58:36,840 --> 00:58:44,360
Europe and kind of the G20 countries, OECD, you know, North America, et cetera. It hasn't replicated

599
00:58:44,360 --> 00:58:48,280
in a bunch of other countries like in Asia and other places in the global south that have attempted

600
00:58:48,280 --> 00:58:52,520
it since then. And it's wildly variable and dependent on a bunch of conditions, including

601
00:58:52,520 --> 00:58:57,880
are you at war or not? Like, like this war is not going to be eco-groovy ever. We burn a ton of

602
00:58:57,880 --> 00:59:03,160
shit and we blow up a ton of shit and we don't care because it's war. Right. So there's a thousand

603
00:59:03,160 --> 00:59:09,800
reasons why the Cousnets curve is not a law of nature, even though it's implicit in every single

604
00:59:09,800 --> 00:59:16,200
pro-growth argument you pretty much ever hear. And up against it is Javon's paradox. And Javon's

605
00:59:16,200 --> 00:59:21,640
paradox is when things get cheaper, you don't consume them cheaper, better, faster, cheaper.

606
00:59:22,440 --> 00:59:27,480
You typically don't end up with a decrease in usage and consumption. You actually end up spiking

607
00:59:27,480 --> 00:59:32,360
and incenting even more consumption. So as we've done all the wind and all the solar and all the

608
00:59:32,360 --> 00:59:36,680
batteries and all the good groovy stuff, right, our carbon burn right now is higher than ever.

609
00:59:38,120 --> 00:59:43,640
So it's basically Cousnets curve versus Javon's paradox. Right. Can we say enough is enough?

610
00:59:43,640 --> 00:59:51,320
Can we buy some efficiencies and bank them or is every innovation going to then incent even further

611
00:59:51,320 --> 00:59:55,160
extreme growth? And as a funny example of that, right, I was just reading this morning that the

612
00:59:55,160 --> 01:00:00,280
Paris Olympics were set out to be super groovy, low carbon footprint. Right. And of course,

613
01:00:00,280 --> 01:00:05,960
they're French and, you know, historically, weather's been really quite nice and mild and

614
01:00:05,960 --> 01:00:11,640
temperate in Paris in the summers. So they didn't bake in air conditioning, right, to all of that,

615
01:00:11,960 --> 01:00:17,480
to the athlete's village. And now they've just done a survey. Every single one of the G8 countries,

616
01:00:18,040 --> 01:00:24,680
right, minus the host, are bringing in portable air conditioners for their athletes because they're

617
01:00:24,680 --> 01:00:30,280
like, no, fuck that. We are people cannot be flopping around on damp sheets, you know, before

618
01:00:30,280 --> 01:00:35,480
their race day, they need to be in 68 degrees. So you see this fascinating thing of like Andrew

619
01:00:35,480 --> 01:00:43,080
Huberman, Tim Ferriss, biohacking optimization culture, right, you should sleep cold and dark

620
01:00:43,080 --> 01:00:49,400
in 68 degrees, which is awesome, right. I'm a huge, huge fan of cold nights, but it's an incredible

621
01:00:49,400 --> 01:00:55,960
privilege. And the fact that France attempted to make these Olympics as clean and groovy as possible,

622
01:00:55,960 --> 01:01:01,720
but in that stand has run right up against carbon footprints and it would have been far on the irony

623
01:01:01,720 --> 01:01:05,800
is they would have been far more eco groovy if they'd actually baked in air conditioning properly

624
01:01:06,360 --> 01:01:11,960
into their builds versus having everybody run extension cords, you know, to generators,

625
01:01:11,960 --> 01:01:16,600
to run little portable units. And so just back, that's back to coming alive versus staying alive,

626
01:01:16,600 --> 01:01:21,560
those two arcs, coming alive, hey, 68 degrees is your optimum sleep temp to get your earring best

627
01:01:21,560 --> 01:01:27,880
scores. And staying alive is, oh my gosh, we're burning so much fossil fuel, we're overheating the

628
01:01:27,880 --> 01:01:37,000
earth. Wow, that was brilliantly said, I love that rant. And you just, you said so many things.

629
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:44,760
And I guess I, one thing I wanted to mention is the changing narratives.

630
01:01:46,680 --> 01:01:52,600
Particularly, I can use movies as an example. I remember when I was young in the 90s, we had

631
01:01:52,600 --> 01:01:58,120
movies that were about humans saving the world. It was like Armageddon, deep impact,

632
01:01:58,760 --> 01:02:04,440
some huge comment was going to hit us and we had to stop it. Then probably about 10 years later,

633
01:02:04,440 --> 01:02:10,440
I noticed a changing narrative where earth is is we've messed up earth too much, and we have to

634
01:02:10,440 --> 01:02:14,840
leave and find some other home. I'm thinking of movies like interstellar. And that seemed to be

635
01:02:14,840 --> 01:02:19,960
like a common theme. I started seeing that a lot more. And then maybe about 10 years later,

636
01:02:20,520 --> 01:02:25,560
I noticed movies that were really pessimistic that humans weren't really a species worth

637
01:02:26,360 --> 01:02:31,720
keeping going. So we were going to end humans now. And we're going to pass the torch on to

638
01:02:31,720 --> 01:02:38,040
something new. And I noticed that theme. I'm also noticing a similar change in narrative with AI.

639
01:02:38,600 --> 01:02:41,880
You know, for a long time, we had all these movies that made AI the villain.

640
01:02:42,600 --> 01:02:46,200
That it was this huge existential threat that was going to take humans out.

641
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:52,200
Now I'm starting to see some interesting movies coming out, where AI is the good thing,

642
01:02:52,200 --> 01:02:57,400
and it keeps society together. And the villain is somebody that comes and shuts that AI off,

643
01:02:58,200 --> 01:03:03,560
and then causes chaos. And I thought, Oh, that's a really interesting like predictive programming

644
01:03:03,560 --> 01:03:09,640
that you're trying to instill in us. And I guess it makes me think that there's some sort of anti

645
01:03:09,640 --> 01:03:15,800
human agenda. You mentioned that there's this camp of people that think that we're like

646
01:03:15,880 --> 01:03:23,000
accidents. And I believe that that anti human agenda is coming from that side.

647
01:03:23,640 --> 01:03:26,200
Are you seeing it all like an anti human agenda?

648
01:03:28,680 --> 01:03:33,400
Yeah, I mean, that's such a great question. And I'm a huge fan of tracking things in film,

649
01:03:33,400 --> 01:03:40,280
exactly as you did. Like what's the pulse? What's the zeitgeist of our moment, right? And I certainly

650
01:03:40,280 --> 01:03:47,480
noticed it with Marvel comics, and even Black Panther, where you had both Thanos and Killmonger,

651
01:03:48,200 --> 01:03:53,640
right? As the anti heroes, they were the bad guys. But the bad guys were actually expressing

652
01:03:53,640 --> 01:03:57,560
more of what was potentially kind of in the discourse or in our conversation than ever.

653
01:03:57,560 --> 01:04:03,080
Like Thanos wasn't wrong. He's like, Look, my planet got trashed. I concluded, right, then in

654
01:04:03,080 --> 01:04:07,720
order to save the universe had to kill half the people or something like that, right? Therefore,

655
01:04:07,720 --> 01:04:13,400
the Thanos snap. And then he got ostracized and he became the super scary bad guy, right?

656
01:04:13,400 --> 01:04:18,360
But he wasn't wrong. He's like, there's too many people for the carrying capacity of this ecosystem.

657
01:04:18,360 --> 01:04:21,960
And I think we get wildly more efficient, but don't succumb to the Javons paradox of just

658
01:04:21,960 --> 01:04:25,240
getting fatter and greedier and consuming more, right? But we actually get more efficient and

659
01:04:25,240 --> 01:04:30,440
consume the same or less. But we're not doing that. So I've got to take drastic measures

660
01:04:30,440 --> 01:04:35,000
to save things. But he's the villain. And you're like, Yeah, you had a point there.

661
01:04:35,080 --> 01:04:39,160
And Killmonger, who I don't quite remember his entire narrative, but I do remember it was

662
01:04:39,160 --> 01:04:46,120
fundamentally a sort of contemporary Malcolm X critique, right? There was that sense of like,

663
01:04:46,120 --> 01:04:52,920
hey, colonialism, hey, racism, hey, all of these things, it's a stacked deck. And to play within

664
01:04:52,920 --> 01:04:59,080
the system is kind of a fool's game. I need to break the system. And so you had many situations

665
01:04:59,080 --> 01:05:05,960
where the critiques of the antihero or the villain are actually expressing some real things

666
01:05:05,960 --> 01:05:09,720
for us to reckon with, whether or not we come down exactly where they did. It's just real issues

667
01:05:09,720 --> 01:05:21,640
and topics to reckon with. So to your point about, are we flawed? Are we bad? You know, is there

668
01:05:21,640 --> 01:05:29,800
something? I mean, to me, it seems very much like the, you know, the simple question is,

669
01:05:30,520 --> 01:05:37,480
is the way forwards? Or do we need to backtrack? You know, is there somewhere where we fell from

670
01:05:37,480 --> 01:05:42,600
grace? And therefore everything, if we keep going the way we've been going, we just sort of

671
01:05:42,600 --> 01:05:48,840
do them to carry out our original sin. Or do we need to slam on the brakes and go back to a fork

672
01:05:48,840 --> 01:05:54,280
in the road that we missed somewhere, right, to get back to righteousness, to get back to balance,

673
01:05:54,280 --> 01:05:59,160
to get back to whatever. And you definitely see that with like Yuval Harari's book sapiens.

674
01:05:59,800 --> 01:06:04,600
And I think most people were probably just sort of, you know, overwhelmed and bedazzled by,

675
01:06:04,600 --> 01:06:10,680
you know, big history kind of take. So they just kind of took it all in. But he, you know, he smuggles

676
01:06:10,680 --> 01:06:17,080
in some, you know, both totally familiar and some relatively controversial content, which is not

677
01:06:17,080 --> 01:06:23,160
the least of which is we were super groovy. This is Marshall Salem's anthropology hypothesis back

678
01:06:23,160 --> 01:06:28,200
in the late 60s of like, man, the hunter gatherer had like had more free time, right? It was egalitarian

679
01:06:28,200 --> 01:06:34,520
societies. It was, it, we were, they were healthier. Everything was groovy. And then big time bad

680
01:06:34,520 --> 01:06:42,440
farming came along. Right. And, and Harari just dusted that chest nut off and completely rebooted

681
01:06:42,520 --> 01:06:47,480
it for sapiens. And everyone's like, Oh, yeah. And if people remember far enough back, there was a

682
01:06:47,480 --> 01:06:53,160
very popular book in the 90s called Ishmael. And it was told by the point of view of a gorilla,

683
01:06:53,160 --> 01:06:57,480
who was a talking gorilla. And he was basically like, like all of civilization is broken down into

684
01:06:57,480 --> 01:07:01,880
levers and takers. And the levers are the groovy indigenous sustainable folks. And the takers are

685
01:07:01,880 --> 01:07:09,080
the kind of, you know, beginnings of white Western capitalist patriarchy. And it resonated,

686
01:07:09,080 --> 01:07:15,400
it sold millions of copies. And it was also, of course, grossly simplified. And those questions

687
01:07:15,400 --> 01:07:21,320
though, right, you know, and even in our conversations around something as heart wrenching

688
01:07:21,320 --> 01:07:28,280
and politically loaded as Gaza, and the Arab Israeli conflict right now, is being coded in

689
01:07:28,280 --> 01:07:35,080
these terms. Right. So you're seeing the fact that on, you know, anti semitism has been a big

690
01:07:35,160 --> 01:07:41,640
question, right? A big, a big issue both in US universities, like Columbia and Harvard and Penn,

691
01:07:42,520 --> 01:07:47,320
as well as a bunch of other places, it's occupying tons of column inches. And it's also

692
01:07:47,320 --> 01:07:55,640
completely gumming up our abilities to look clearly at a geopolitical crisis. And whose side

693
01:07:55,640 --> 01:07:59,160
is on what and what's going on? Because, you know, one of the things just one second,

694
01:07:59,720 --> 01:08:05,880
like, dude, I don't even know if I want to go into this. Do you want to? I mean, it's tight,

695
01:08:05,880 --> 01:08:09,880
but it's just if we want it, it just depends on this is this is an absolute rats in

696
01:08:09,880 --> 01:08:13,000
Islam. And I'm not going to be advocating a personal opinion on it, but I'm going to

697
01:08:13,960 --> 01:08:19,400
potentially just unpack that whole tribalism, capitalism, colonialism thing.

698
01:08:20,680 --> 01:08:23,400
That sounds great. Yeah. Is that all right? I mean, it sounds

699
01:08:24,920 --> 01:08:27,480
like a great idea. Let's hear it. Okay.

700
01:08:30,120 --> 01:08:37,160
So quite a bit of the, I mean, obviously, there's a tragic humanitarian situation

701
01:08:38,200 --> 01:08:45,080
in Gaza right now and in Ukraine and in Darfur and in many places in the world. So Sub-Saharan

702
01:08:45,080 --> 01:08:52,280
Africa is, you know, is on fire. There's all sorts of sadness and loss of life happening there.

703
01:08:53,640 --> 01:08:57,480
Obviously, we've been tracking Ukraine for the last couple of years and most recently and

704
01:09:00,040 --> 01:09:03,000
sort of explosively and controversially what's happening in Gaza.

705
01:09:04,600 --> 01:09:15,800
Part of the support for Palestinians has been coded as Israelis as colonizers.

706
01:09:17,240 --> 01:09:25,080
And that has then sort of activated the meme complex of social justice,

707
01:09:25,720 --> 01:09:33,880
post-Marxist academic critiques in the United States. So when they get accused of anti-Semitism,

708
01:09:34,920 --> 01:09:43,080
it's a relatively new kind of anti-Semitism, right? It's Jews as coded as white,

709
01:09:44,600 --> 01:09:51,640
coded as colonizers, and colonizers are always bad and colonized,

710
01:09:52,360 --> 01:09:57,480
a.k.a. Franz Fanon, you know, and Wretched of the Earth and Blackskins White Mask and other,

711
01:09:57,480 --> 01:10:02,840
you know, other academics and thinkers in that space. And Mark Hughes and some others, which,

712
01:10:02,840 --> 01:10:07,880
by the way, went straight into Ibram Kendi's philosophy of like, you know, you know, basically,

713
01:10:07,880 --> 01:10:15,800
the cure to, you know, the, or the solution or response to racism is anti-racism directed at

714
01:10:15,800 --> 01:10:21,400
the racists, right? So you ended up with some of those very tight arguments. So we end up with the

715
01:10:21,400 --> 01:10:29,720
emergence of a new type of anti-Semitism, which is, which is coding Jews and specifically Israeli

716
01:10:29,720 --> 01:10:35,800
Jews as white, as colonizers. Now, at the same time, which is very weird, because that's typically

717
01:10:35,800 --> 01:10:40,120
that pro-Palestinian supporters coming from the progressive left, which has almost always been,

718
01:10:41,080 --> 01:10:46,360
you know, huge supporters of ethnic diversity and inclusion. And then historically, the entire

719
01:10:46,360 --> 01:10:53,400
American civil rights movement in the sixties was hand in glove Jewish college students and

720
01:10:53,400 --> 01:10:59,400
Southern blacks. And that was a coalition and alliance. You know, and on the, on the far side,

721
01:10:59,400 --> 01:11:06,840
on the right was the Ku Klux Klan, right, who famously, you know, were against reconstruction

722
01:11:06,840 --> 01:11:12,280
and against black voting rights and participation and citizenship, but hot on the heels of that

723
01:11:12,280 --> 01:11:19,640
hit list for the Klan were Catholics and Jews, right? So you're like, oh, wait a sec. Now,

724
01:11:19,640 --> 01:11:28,200
how is it that now the American right seems to be the staunchest supporter of Israeli practices

725
01:11:28,200 --> 01:11:37,240
and policies, right? When just 40 odd years ago, they were the ones who were most, most anti-Semitic

726
01:11:37,240 --> 01:11:43,480
and that was a totally different anti-Semitism. That is Jews as other. So you've got Jews as

727
01:11:43,480 --> 01:11:47,560
cultural other. And this is the protocol, you know, the protocols of the elders of Zion. This is

728
01:11:47,560 --> 01:11:52,440
all the classic anti-Semitic tropes of Jews as separate Jews as not bowing down to our same

729
01:11:52,440 --> 01:11:57,800
gods and the Jews as not, not loyal to the country or the nation that they live in, etc. It's all

730
01:11:57,800 --> 01:12:05,240
the old school ethnic anti-Semitism, right? Where on the left, you have political anti-Semitism.

731
01:12:05,240 --> 01:12:11,480
They're two completely different anti-Semitism, right? But they still end up in the chaos. And

732
01:12:11,480 --> 01:12:17,480
then you think, okay, in that meme complex, right? What is the sort of elephant under the rug or

733
01:12:17,480 --> 01:12:25,080
not even under the rug, right? With all coding or understanding of Jewishness. It's the Holocaust

734
01:12:25,800 --> 01:12:31,240
and never again. Now you go onto the Palestinian side of the fence and you have,

735
01:12:32,200 --> 01:12:38,520
you know, what's, what's the, what's the memetic anchor? 9-11 and ISIS. And all the way back to

736
01:12:38,520 --> 01:12:43,400
the Crusades, right? But the idea of like, somewhere in there, you're having to respond to and either

737
01:12:43,400 --> 01:12:49,560
accept or reject the notion of barbarism, of which October the 7th, tragically and sadly,

738
01:12:50,120 --> 01:12:57,400
with Hamas's activities, reinvigorated. And now you end up with, with Palestinians coded as

739
01:12:58,040 --> 01:13:05,000
colonized, therefore always just in their reactions against, oh, but what about Muslim

740
01:13:05,000 --> 01:13:10,680
barbarism? Samuel Huntington, clash of civilizations, Sam Harris, right? With his railing against

741
01:13:10,680 --> 01:13:15,480
Islam and saying, hey, you know, Islam didn't experience a Protestant, the equivalent of a

742
01:13:15,480 --> 01:13:20,120
Protestant Reformation. They're basically a medieval death cult. You know, Sam Harris has, has been

743
01:13:20,120 --> 01:13:26,440
quite adamant on some of those points. So you can kind of see both the meme map and how the

744
01:13:26,440 --> 01:13:34,200
different characters in the plots are getting coded. And it's very, very confusing because we're

745
01:13:34,200 --> 01:13:41,160
all running different scripts. And so we're not even seeing the same movie anymore. And therefore,

746
01:13:41,160 --> 01:13:47,960
coming to any kind of humanitarian company, you know, and or, you know, governmental common ground

747
01:13:48,600 --> 01:13:53,960
is damn near impossible. And the same thing is even happening in the environmental movement. I

748
01:13:53,960 --> 01:13:58,200
occasionally have advised Extinction Rebellion, which was kind of, which came up with Greta Thunberg

749
01:13:58,200 --> 01:14:03,160
and some of those others, they've led some of the most effective protests in 2018 to 2020.

750
01:14:03,160 --> 01:14:07,480
And speaking with one of their founders, they're like, oh, well, you know, post George Floyd,

751
01:14:07,480 --> 01:14:13,560
post quarantine, post all of those, those sort of social justice awakenings collectively, they're

752
01:14:13,560 --> 01:14:19,640
like, we're not going to do anything until we've decolonized Africa. I mean, I'm paraphrasing,

753
01:14:19,640 --> 01:14:24,440
but it was fundamentally that. And I just thought, oh, no, you know, like, you're one,

754
01:14:24,440 --> 01:14:29,640
like, you're done, you're dead in the water, like, like, like, like, you've now got way too many

755
01:14:29,640 --> 01:14:33,960
issues, you're just trying to solve the world and tire pain and all injustices everywhere,

756
01:14:33,960 --> 01:14:40,120
while the clock is ticking on, you know, carbon and anything else. But what's really interesting to

757
01:14:40,120 --> 01:14:45,800
me is, you know, and this is somewhat of a theme of our conversation, which is waking up and paying

758
01:14:45,800 --> 01:14:52,600
attention to the enormity scope and scale of the world's suffering, the consequences of our

759
01:14:52,600 --> 01:14:59,400
extended actions, and the potential grief of coming to terms with kind of the triaging of what's

760
01:14:59,400 --> 01:15:07,880
possible and what's not. And what is delicate, fragile, wounded, but vital to protect, preserve

761
01:15:07,960 --> 01:15:14,440
meant. What is kind of already done, it's cooked. So just basically cut our losses

762
01:15:15,000 --> 01:15:19,480
and don't burn more time trying to fix something or prop something up that is fundamentally doomed.

763
01:15:20,120 --> 01:15:26,760
And then what is new or different or better that we ought to with absolute clarity and speed

764
01:15:28,680 --> 01:15:36,440
get to making or building soon. So in that, right, in our civilizational calculus,

765
01:15:36,440 --> 01:15:43,240
you're kind of like, how did we end up here? And where did we go wrong? I actually had this

766
01:15:43,240 --> 01:15:47,880
thought watching Darren Aronofsky, the director's moat, I don't know if it's his most recent,

767
01:15:47,880 --> 01:15:52,200
but it was a recent documentary he did called The Territory, which is all about a relatively

768
01:15:52,200 --> 01:15:57,240
uncontacted tribe in the Amazon. And it was just literally like this patch of rainforest that was

769
01:15:57,240 --> 01:16:01,080
their territory. And it was shrinking and shrinking and shrinking and getting chopped on all sides.

770
01:16:01,720 --> 01:16:08,200
And the first thing that blew me away about is that it was billed as here is this self-documentary

771
01:16:08,200 --> 01:16:12,520
by a sort of an uncontacted tribe. And so I was like, okay, this is going to be neat. This is going

772
01:16:12,520 --> 01:16:19,080
to be like that Robert Neera movie, The Mission with the Guarani or some other tribe from centuries

773
01:16:19,080 --> 01:16:23,880
ago. And it wasn't the first thing was they were all wearing like O'Neill and Bill Among and Nike

774
01:16:23,880 --> 01:16:29,880
t-shirts. And you're like, oh, sweet Jesus, like there they are wearing, of course they would dress

775
01:16:29,960 --> 01:16:35,320
up in their ceremonial gob for a video shoot or doing a ceremony. But like fundamentally they're

776
01:16:35,320 --> 01:16:40,680
kicking it in flip flops and branded Western logo t-shirts. And you're like, oh my God,

777
01:16:40,680 --> 01:16:45,800
like that all reaches. And then they interviewed the white settlers that were being aided and

778
01:16:45,800 --> 01:16:50,840
abetted by Bolsonaro's policies. And they were interviewing the younger generation of chiefs,

779
01:16:50,840 --> 01:16:55,400
their chief, their newly appointed chief was like a 30 year old. And he was online and tech savvy,

780
01:16:55,400 --> 01:16:58,920
and he was part of the one who was shooting and telling their stories. So super interesting,

781
01:16:59,000 --> 01:17:05,400
kind of intersections of cultures. And nobody interviewed on either side of that situation

782
01:17:05,400 --> 01:17:09,720
thought that they had any chance of turning back the tide of logging, settlement,

783
01:17:10,280 --> 01:17:16,680
cattle farming, ranching, deforestation, you know, and cultural assimilation, assimilation. And even

784
01:17:17,400 --> 01:17:23,720
last week, there was a New York Times article on a do-gooder white Christian woman, you know,

785
01:17:23,720 --> 01:17:30,440
for whatever it was, from Kansas or Oklahoma, who had written a check to get 14 starlings

786
01:17:31,480 --> 01:17:37,640
delivered to a remote tribe. And the whole hope was this could let them know when bad folks were

787
01:17:37,640 --> 01:17:41,320
coming, whether it was oil or rubber or gas or for ranching and protect themselves, they could

788
01:17:41,320 --> 01:17:45,080
coordinate, they could have better medical care, all the normal things. What happened is it completely

789
01:17:45,080 --> 01:17:49,960
broke their society in six months flat. The kid, the men go all got addicted to porn. The teenagers

790
01:17:49,960 --> 01:17:54,120
got stuck on their phones and stopped coming to meetings and stopped coming observing ceremonies

791
01:17:54,120 --> 01:17:58,600
and the grandparents were scattered and fragmented. And at the end of all that, they're like,

792
01:17:58,600 --> 01:18:04,440
and please don't take it away. So that got me deeply thinking, I'm like, Oh my God,

793
01:18:04,440 --> 01:18:13,320
what is this sort of mollic notion? What is this giant, all devouring, all consuming beast that

794
01:18:13,320 --> 01:18:22,120
just seems to be unstoppable? And how on earth do we reckon with it? And what occurred to me is

795
01:18:22,120 --> 01:18:30,520
that, you know, capitalism is arguably one of the most efficient means of organizing matter

796
01:18:30,520 --> 01:18:37,640
and energy that humans have ever devised in the simplest sense that it just continues to outcompete

797
01:18:37,640 --> 01:18:42,520
all the other options. So you have to be like, okay, there's some there, there, however, but on

798
01:18:42,520 --> 01:18:47,560
the other hand, look at the social, cultural, ecological cost is clearly not totally right.

799
01:18:47,560 --> 01:18:52,440
Like there's something also deeply off about it. In what does it relentlessly keep doing?

800
01:18:53,080 --> 01:18:57,160
And that's when I began to kind of inquire into, Oh, what is the, what is the calculus?

801
01:18:57,160 --> 01:19:01,480
What is our civilizational calculus? What is the math problem or the math equation

802
01:19:02,120 --> 01:19:08,440
that drives all of our behaviors? And what are we missing? You know, is there something in this

803
01:19:08,440 --> 01:19:13,800
equation that it works, but it's missing key elements. And I began to wonder, and this goes

804
01:19:13,800 --> 01:19:19,080
back to Gaza and the questions of antisemitism and colonialism and coding as whiteness. This goes

805
01:19:19,080 --> 01:19:23,080
back to the environmental movements, and we have to decolonize the world and all of these elements.

806
01:19:23,080 --> 01:19:29,560
And how are we fighting? And why do we keep over consuming like hungry ghosts? So it felt to me

807
01:19:29,560 --> 01:19:36,040
like there were three major sort of phases. And this is in, this is kind of in order as to how

808
01:19:36,040 --> 01:19:41,160
they unfolded historically, but none of them have ever unfolded in isolation from the others.

809
01:19:41,160 --> 01:19:48,520
So they keep building on each other. So the first is tribalism, then colonialism, then capitalism.

810
01:19:49,400 --> 01:19:55,160
And each of them has sort of, you know, natural intuitive logic as to why they exist and also

811
01:19:55,160 --> 01:20:00,840
problems. And if we can figure out and solve for their problems, we might, might have a chance at

812
01:20:00,840 --> 01:20:07,400
a slightly more healthy and sustainable civilization. So the first and most obvious is tribalism.

813
01:20:08,040 --> 01:20:13,960
And its externality, the thing it doesn't include, right, is others. It's us versus them.

814
01:20:14,600 --> 01:20:20,120
So it's a sort of, it's a social externality. There's the us, and we are literally quite often,

815
01:20:20,120 --> 01:20:25,240
I mean, so many indigenous peoples own name for themselves. It's just the people, you know,

816
01:20:25,240 --> 01:20:28,920
it's usually like in history books, it becomes, you know, they get called where the, whether it's

817
01:20:28,920 --> 01:20:33,480
the Sue or the Iroquois or whomever it might be, it's typically their enemies call them that names

818
01:20:33,480 --> 01:20:38,360
or the ones that became scouts or, you know, or collaborators with the Westerners get to name

819
01:20:38,360 --> 01:20:43,320
the people. But the people is almost always the people, it's us. And we are right and good and

820
01:20:43,320 --> 01:20:49,240
true. And everybody who's a part of our community is entitled to all the rights of our society and

821
01:20:49,240 --> 01:20:53,480
how we operate. But if you live across the river, if you worship different gods, if you look funny,

822
01:20:53,480 --> 01:20:59,640
talks funny, smell funny, right, you're them. And you are not the people and you are not like we

823
01:20:59,640 --> 01:21:04,680
are not obliged to treat you the way we treat each other at all. And this is the barbarian,

824
01:21:04,680 --> 01:21:11,080
this is the heretic, this is the apostate, right, this is the pagan, whatever it might be. So we get

825
01:21:11,080 --> 01:21:15,720
to in the game of energy credits of like how do we move through this world and secure enough

826
01:21:15,720 --> 01:21:21,400
resources to keep us alive and thriving, right, we don't have to extend that to you. We are not,

827
01:21:21,400 --> 01:21:27,160
we are not the other's keeper, we are just our brother's keeper. So the externality is us versus

828
01:21:27,160 --> 01:21:33,480
them. Right. And it works. It's literally from a mother parent and mother child bond to family bonds

829
01:21:33,480 --> 01:21:40,840
to clan, you know, to tribe to clan to band to tribe to nation. That's how we do it. And tribalism

830
01:21:40,840 --> 01:21:46,280
these days has been politicized into nation nationalism. Right. So it's still that same

831
01:21:46,280 --> 01:21:53,400
through line, but it's ancient, ancient, ancient. The next is colonialism. Right. And colonialism

832
01:21:53,400 --> 01:22:00,120
you could basically just say is asymmetric trade at the point of a sword. Right. So when you've got

833
01:22:00,120 --> 01:22:05,960
tribes us versus them, there's still kind of thems that are closer to us than the then total

834
01:22:05,960 --> 01:22:11,000
wildcards total barbarians. And there are neighbors, right, those are bloodlines, those are

835
01:22:11,000 --> 01:22:15,000
intermarriage, those are geographic proximity, there's all those things and we trade with them.

836
01:22:15,640 --> 01:22:18,760
All right. And you've got some cool stuff and we might specialize or we live closer to the

837
01:22:18,760 --> 01:22:23,000
coast and you guys live in the forest or whatever it might be. And through extended trading networks

838
01:22:23,000 --> 01:22:29,800
that are mostly balanced and reciprocal, we exchange goods and services and again, you know,

839
01:22:29,800 --> 01:22:35,640
marriages into intermarriage and relationships and kinship ties. So that's trade. And that is

840
01:22:35,640 --> 01:22:42,760
an enormous layer of human cultural extension and vitality and vibrancy. It raises the quality

841
01:22:42,760 --> 01:22:46,200
of life of everyone who participates in it. Right. I mean, there are there are there are

842
01:22:46,200 --> 01:22:50,920
examples of cowrie shells in the Great Plains, you know, that have made it thousands of miles

843
01:22:50,920 --> 01:22:55,160
through trade networks to there. There's Pemicon, which is a sort of basically a super duper

844
01:22:55,160 --> 01:22:59,400
trail mix with either bear fat and grease or salmon and berries and things done in the Pacific

845
01:22:59,400 --> 01:23:02,920
Northwest that also made it to the Lakota and other and the Comanche and other places. You're

846
01:23:02,920 --> 01:23:07,320
like, oh my gosh, sir, like the world has always been wildly interconnected, the Silk Route, all

847
01:23:07,320 --> 01:23:14,520
of that kind of stuff. And but then when it ceases to be reciprocal and it becomes asymmetrical

848
01:23:15,160 --> 01:23:22,760
and enforced by force, that's when you get colonialism. And the externality there is here,

849
01:23:23,320 --> 01:23:28,680
AKA the country with the power or the tribe with the power versus there, we're going to chop down

850
01:23:28,680 --> 01:23:32,520
your trees, we're going to hunt your beaver, we're going to enslave your people, we're going to dig

851
01:23:32,520 --> 01:23:38,200
up your gold and silver and shiny things and we're going to take them from there over to here.

852
01:23:38,760 --> 01:23:43,080
Right. And it's that great line at the end of the godfather, which was Honoré de Balzac,

853
01:23:43,080 --> 01:23:50,200
but he said behind every great fortune lies a theft. And that's pretty much the bumper sticker

854
01:23:50,200 --> 01:23:56,120
for colonialism. Right. And even to this day, where whether it's the Elgin marbles or various,

855
01:23:56,120 --> 01:24:00,920
you know, the British Royal museums are stocked with loot from other countries and these other

856
01:24:00,920 --> 01:24:04,440
countries are now self aware enough and politically active enough. And in case they're like, we'd

857
01:24:04,440 --> 01:24:09,720
like our shit back, you know, and James Cameron, not James Cameron, sorry, David Cameron,

858
01:24:10,840 --> 01:24:14,200
and other British politicians have been like, yeah, well, I mean, if we gave it all back,

859
01:24:14,200 --> 01:24:17,640
we'd have nothing in our museum. So we're not giving we're not giving it back. And you're kind

860
01:24:17,640 --> 01:24:24,200
of like, oh, my gosh, that is really as pronounced an example of here versus there externalities

861
01:24:24,200 --> 01:24:29,080
as you could think of. And then the final one is capitalism. This kind of gets us back to

862
01:24:29,640 --> 01:24:36,600
Aronofsky and the territory and sort of what is this giant all consuming machine. And capitalism,

863
01:24:36,600 --> 01:24:45,800
its externality is now versus later. We will always take the profit now this month, this quarter,

864
01:24:45,800 --> 01:24:53,640
this year, we will always over fish over hunt over log over farm over grays, because to extract the

865
01:24:53,640 --> 01:25:00,040
profit now, more to the point to not extract the profit now is goes against everything we believe,

866
01:25:00,040 --> 01:25:07,880
including legally enforceable penalties, right, Milton Friedman, the economist famously advanced

867
01:25:07,880 --> 01:25:13,960
first in a New York Times article, and then in like 1971 or 72 of just like the sole purpose of

868
01:25:13,960 --> 01:25:18,680
a company should be just to maximize shareholder profits. And that was just him thinking out

869
01:25:18,680 --> 01:25:24,520
loud. It was an op ed in the magazine on a Sunday. And it wasn't until like 1985 or 1986,

870
01:25:24,520 --> 01:25:30,120
where the Revlon shampoo company was going to be hostile, he bought out and they and their

871
01:25:30,120 --> 01:25:33,720
board members tried to sue to prevent it because they're like, we're going to be bought out by this

872
01:25:33,720 --> 01:25:37,560
cheap ass five and dime store that's just going to gut us for parts and ruin our brain and we want

873
01:25:37,560 --> 01:25:43,800
to block the sale. And so mid 80s was when it actually got enshrined in federal law. No, no,

874
01:25:43,800 --> 01:25:50,360
actually, Friedman was right. sole responsibility of shareholders is to maximize profits. So that

875
01:25:50,360 --> 01:25:55,160
opened up the whole Gordon Gekko greed is good 1980s, like with the hostile takeovers and leverage

876
01:25:55,160 --> 01:26:01,880
buyouts and all of that. It also forced John Mackie to sell Whole Foods to Amazon, because he

877
01:26:01,880 --> 01:26:07,400
was getting he was being strong on by a venture capital fund that earned 8% earned 8% of Whole

878
01:26:07,400 --> 01:26:11,320
Foods and was going to basically gut them for parts because all of the inefficiencies in their

879
01:26:11,320 --> 01:26:15,160
business like supporting organic farmers and having healthy policies for their for their

880
01:26:15,160 --> 01:26:19,880
employees, all of that was just wasn't was not justifying. And that's how he ended up having

881
01:26:19,880 --> 01:26:25,720
to sell to Amazon. And it's also what prompted the Twitter board to accept Elon Musk's wildly

882
01:26:25,720 --> 01:26:29,480
overpriced offer for Twitter, even though they were deeply concerned as to what he was going to

883
01:26:29,480 --> 01:26:34,440
do about it, because they because basically they were as members as members of the board,

884
01:26:34,440 --> 01:26:40,760
they were fiduciarily responsible and subject to being sued. If they hadn't accepted that wildly

885
01:26:40,760 --> 01:26:45,640
overpriced offer for Twitter, which if you were an old school lover of Twitter, and you really

886
01:26:45,640 --> 01:26:49,720
cared for and cherished the way Jack Dorsey and the others had built the thing and what that

887
01:26:49,720 --> 01:26:54,280
community and cultural, you know, you might have been right to see this as coming destruction.

888
01:26:54,920 --> 01:27:01,640
But they had to say yes, no matter what their personal feelings were. So capitalism is always

889
01:27:01,640 --> 01:27:06,440
eating your seed corn, right? The idea of like typically right farmers will always want to save

890
01:27:07,240 --> 01:27:11,720
corn to then plant for the next harvest. If you eat your seed corn because you're too hungry in

891
01:27:11,720 --> 01:27:15,560
the winter and you didn't plan right, then you've got nothing to plant the next year and then you're

892
01:27:15,560 --> 01:27:22,280
doubly triply out of luck. So if you take a look at those three things, tribalism, the externality

893
01:27:22,280 --> 01:27:30,280
is them at the expense of us, or us, sorry, us at the expense of them. Colonialism is there,

894
01:27:30,840 --> 01:27:36,760
or Jesus Christ. Colonialism is here at the expense of there. And capitalism

895
01:27:38,040 --> 01:27:45,960
is now at the expense of later. So a tidy integration of those things is to say how

896
01:27:45,960 --> 01:27:51,800
would we fix the math so that our civilizational calculus actually spits out healthy, sustainable,

897
01:27:51,800 --> 01:27:58,520
equitable answers is to say instead of us versus them, right, it's everyone.

898
01:27:59,480 --> 01:28:08,440
Instead of here versus there, it's everywhere. And instead of now versus later, it's everyone.

899
01:28:09,880 --> 01:28:14,760
So if we built our civilizational calculus, instead of having all these externalities,

900
01:28:14,760 --> 01:28:19,720
right, that other people and other places and other times have to get stuck with the bill,

901
01:28:20,840 --> 01:28:25,240
right, get bankrupted, if we could all settle on everyone everywhere, everyone

902
01:28:25,240 --> 01:28:32,680
is how we choose to make decisions going forward. We would have a shot at making the most of the

903
01:28:32,680 --> 01:28:39,400
tools, the very deep structural cultural tools we have of tribalism, trade, right, and commerce

904
01:28:39,400 --> 01:28:47,640
and innovation and bundle them together in ways that don't keep spitting out pathological or dysfunctional

905
01:28:47,720 --> 01:28:56,040
answers. That was beautifully presented. And once again, I'm going to have to review what you

906
01:28:56,040 --> 01:29:02,600
just said and think on it over and over again. You have an amazing way of just putting these

907
01:29:02,600 --> 01:29:08,840
very complex ideas together. And I'm scribbling down notes so fast that my paper is catching

908
01:29:08,840 --> 01:29:17,640
on fire here. But I'm wondering, can these three levels, the colonization, the capitalism and the

909
01:29:17,640 --> 01:29:23,640
tribalism, could that be solved on an individual level? Or is this something that a third party

910
01:29:23,640 --> 01:29:33,160
system needs to come in and fix? Well, I mean, gosh, that is such a massive question. I think

911
01:29:33,160 --> 01:29:42,280
the simplest is there's so much inertia behind all of these things that individual change is

912
01:29:42,280 --> 01:29:49,880
sort of necessary, but not sufficient. And that is, and again, in the same way that that

913
01:29:49,880 --> 01:29:53,960
environmental cosnets curve, the idea of like, oh, the way forward is faster because, you know,

914
01:29:53,960 --> 01:29:58,920
advanced societies pollute less, but we really kind of want to just hear that so we don't scrutinize

915
01:29:58,920 --> 01:30:05,800
it too much as to how it's consistently true is that notion. The idea that change comes from within,

916
01:30:05,800 --> 01:30:11,560
and if I want to heal the world, I have to work first to heal myself, becomes an incredible bit

917
01:30:11,560 --> 01:30:17,880
of motivated reasoning to just shove my head all the way up my ass in a bunch of narcissistic

918
01:30:17,880 --> 01:30:25,000
personal growth and self-help, which is without a doubt just a part of neoliberal capture of

919
01:30:25,000 --> 01:30:30,520
fragmented, isolated consumer individuals scratching all the itches that get agitated

920
01:30:30,520 --> 01:30:35,720
via the constant barrage of marketing messages of quick fixes and easy hits and utopian outcomes.

921
01:30:36,280 --> 01:30:42,360
So in that level, it is sort of again, yes, of course, if you come from hate, you will so hate,

922
01:30:43,000 --> 01:30:47,720
you know, you plant ice, you're going to harvest wind, right? So there is some element of interior

923
01:30:47,720 --> 01:30:54,040
change. And if you look at the largest, most, you know, high impact change agents, at least in the last,

924
01:30:54,040 --> 01:31:00,280
you know, few decades from Nelson Mandela to Gandhi to King to kind of the usual suspects,

925
01:31:00,840 --> 01:31:06,600
they all were coming from a fundamentally different frequency than the tribal people they led.

926
01:31:07,240 --> 01:31:11,400
And Malcolm X as well, right? And Fred Hampton, there's a number of instances where

927
01:31:12,360 --> 01:31:20,360
that those leaders were clearly vibrating, you know, on a different frequency than the

928
01:31:20,360 --> 01:31:27,000
center of gravity of the people they inspired and fundamentally led. So a huge, you know,

929
01:31:27,000 --> 01:31:33,240
hat tip and acknowledgement to the power of transformational consciousness and its ability

930
01:31:33,800 --> 01:31:41,160
to set a tone that otherwise a bunch of disorganized, fractious primates would never get to in a

931
01:31:41,160 --> 01:31:45,000
million years. I often think of it like we used to live in Santa Barbara and there was this

932
01:31:45,000 --> 01:31:51,240
historic Sunday sunset drum circle on the beach. And our music teacher, who was this brilliant

933
01:31:51,880 --> 01:32:03,560
Sarod and Satara player, he and his crew of Tabla and Gembe and Conga players would often be there

934
01:32:03,560 --> 01:32:07,560
and they would be the core of the drum circle. And you'd go on those nights and that drum circle

935
01:32:07,560 --> 01:32:13,560
was tear the roof off funky, right, with hundreds of people like huge energy pulsing. And the thing

936
01:32:13,560 --> 01:32:18,840
was amazing. And then they would be on tour. And you go down there on that weekend. And there was

937
01:32:18,840 --> 01:32:23,720
nobody who was deeply, deeply talented gifted in the center of that drum circle. And it would be a

938
01:32:23,720 --> 01:32:30,280
noodley, mushy hippie shit show. And so you do kind of think like, Oh, who's the metronome? Who's

939
01:32:30,280 --> 01:32:37,080
the timekeeper? Because it's far easier. Like it takes a field to hold a field. It takes somebody's

940
01:32:37,080 --> 01:32:43,080
coherent energy to then bring everybody into that. It's far easier to follow a good beat

941
01:32:43,080 --> 01:32:50,040
than it is to hold one yourself if you're not trained. The flip side is, is that in order for

942
01:32:50,040 --> 01:32:57,000
us to sort of quote unquote, fix at a societal level, or at a global level, the other element.

943
01:32:57,000 --> 01:33:04,360
So tribalism is just, you know, basically after oxytocin, you know, which bonds mother to child

944
01:33:04,360 --> 01:33:10,440
and, and, you know, tribe to tribe, everything and everything is optional. So all of our humanist

945
01:33:10,520 --> 01:33:13,960
elements, all of our efforts to say, Hey, that person on the other side of the world that I

946
01:33:13,960 --> 01:33:18,040
don't know, that doesn't worship the same cause, that doesn't speak the same language or eat the

947
01:33:18,040 --> 01:33:24,280
same foods, and I'll never meet again, is entitled to something intrinsically human as am I? Like

948
01:33:24,280 --> 01:33:30,680
that is an incredibly fragile experiment. And it is not encoded into our DNA, into our biology,

949
01:33:30,680 --> 01:33:36,360
into our neurochemistry, or even in any level of our survival and printing. Like I mean mine.

950
01:33:36,760 --> 01:33:43,240
Now, and next is our survival and printing. So everyone, everywhere, everyone is Bodhisattva

951
01:33:44,120 --> 01:33:51,400
level awareness, and it's fragile. But as far as like helping like colonialism, you know,

952
01:33:51,400 --> 01:33:57,000
the idea of extraction of the point of a sword, that can for sure be, you know, quote unquote,

953
01:33:57,000 --> 01:34:04,680
fixed in the simple sense of acknowledging the originator of natural resources, goods, and services,

954
01:34:05,000 --> 01:34:13,080
and cutting them into the economic deal. I mean, the fact that in Nigeria, they are a net exporter

955
01:34:13,640 --> 01:34:20,280
of fossil fuels that then get refined, piped to Europe, refined and then sold back to them

956
01:34:20,280 --> 01:34:27,400
at a profit. You're like, that's, that's horribly, horribly wrong. And Sierra Leone, there was a

957
01:34:27,400 --> 01:34:35,720
very cool TED talk by a woman from Sierra Leone, being like, we're often, you know, labeled as one

958
01:34:35,720 --> 01:34:39,720
of the poorest countries in Africa, et cetera. We're not. And she talked about, you know, their

959
01:34:39,720 --> 01:34:43,160
mining assets, the diamonds, like all of these things, like here's our natural resources, we're

960
01:34:43,160 --> 01:34:50,280
we actually massively gifted in those terms, we've just been totally exploited. So fixing

961
01:34:50,280 --> 01:34:56,600
colonialism simply by not allowing rapacious multinational companies in cahoots with the IMF

962
01:34:56,600 --> 01:35:01,560
and World Bank and debt leveraged, you know, extortion, setting up terms and conditions that

963
01:35:01,560 --> 01:35:07,080
just siphon off natural resources. Let's just start with that. Never mind what would one do with 500

964
01:35:07,080 --> 01:35:11,320
years of reparations, like that's probably politically, economically feasible, you know,

965
01:35:11,320 --> 01:35:17,640
not feasible to sort in any meaningful way. But doing right by folks right now could be. And let's

966
01:35:17,640 --> 01:35:23,960
start with that. And then with capitalism, and Daniel Schmackenberger, Daniel Schmackenberger

967
01:35:23,960 --> 01:35:30,360
and I have actually had this conversation, because so many of his critiques lead to, oh,

968
01:35:30,360 --> 01:35:35,640
this is a self terminating system. Therefore, you have to get politicians to stop doing it.

969
01:35:35,640 --> 01:35:39,880
And I'm like, well, what politician in their right mind could say anything that you've just said,

970
01:35:40,600 --> 01:35:44,440
and not instantly be branded as a Marxist and instantly lose their term and office,

971
01:35:44,440 --> 01:35:48,440
and therefore all their access to influence, you know, so it would just be it would be career

972
01:35:48,440 --> 01:35:52,440
suicide, and then they wouldn't be on team good guy being able to affect any change. So we have to

973
01:35:52,520 --> 01:35:59,000
have something that splits the difference. And my personal feeling is that saying, you know,

974
01:35:59,000 --> 01:36:04,920
like the rallying cry of free the market, free the market. Capitalism is a great idea. It's just

975
01:36:04,920 --> 01:36:11,880
never been tried, right? It's always been monopolies, rent seeking, crony capitalism, subsidies,

976
01:36:11,880 --> 01:36:15,800
you know, like, like whether it's lobbyists or whatever it is, like, like it's that we've never

977
01:36:15,800 --> 01:36:23,480
actually had that, you know, classroom ideal of an economic a free love a frictionless

978
01:36:23,480 --> 01:36:27,400
exchange of good services with with dynamic pricing reflecting needs and values and all

979
01:36:27,400 --> 01:36:32,440
the things that you hear about an econ class have never actually been tried. So let's do that,

980
01:36:32,440 --> 01:36:36,920
let's free the market. And that's kind of your judo move of getting both conservatives and

981
01:36:36,920 --> 01:36:41,000
progressives on the same team, because you're not trying to break the entire system, you're just

982
01:36:41,000 --> 01:36:45,560
saying let's actually do the thing we said we were going to. Let's start with let's let's not

983
01:36:45,560 --> 01:36:50,120
even worry about universal basic income. Let's just have everybody pay their fair share.

984
01:36:51,160 --> 01:36:55,000
So whatever the tax code is right now, it could be wildly asymmetrical, it could be regressive,

985
01:36:55,000 --> 01:36:58,200
it could be a bunch of things, but right now there's so many loopholes and so many exceptions

986
01:36:58,200 --> 01:37:02,280
for the wealthiest folks, let's just have everybody pay their fair share. Let's just start with that.

987
01:37:03,160 --> 01:37:08,440
Let's abolish the 14th amendment, right, because the 14th amendment, which most people remember

988
01:37:08,440 --> 01:37:11,080
from high school is like, Oh, that's the one that freed the slaves, isn't it? That's a good one.

989
01:37:11,080 --> 01:37:18,280
You're like, Yeah, but weirdly, bizarrely, 20 years later, Leland Stanford, who founded Stanford

990
01:37:18,280 --> 01:37:25,320
University, and his his railroad, his lawyers, trying to wiggle out of some taxes, completely

991
01:37:25,320 --> 01:37:30,600
made up a complete fabrication that the 14th amendment really meant guaranteeing the rights

992
01:37:30,600 --> 01:37:34,680
of personhood to corporations as well. It's the craziest story you've ever heard because

993
01:37:35,240 --> 01:37:40,120
the Supreme Court has seen has judged like 280 cases or something since then,

994
01:37:40,120 --> 01:37:45,960
defending the right of corporations as persons, and only like 30 on actually the rights of Black

995
01:37:45,960 --> 01:37:51,960
folks as citizens. So it hijacked the entire thing, and has given us all of 20th and 21st

996
01:37:51,960 --> 01:37:58,520
century law on how much political power corporations have. Right, so you've got to

997
01:37:58,520 --> 01:38:03,240
banish, abolish that and the Friedman doctrine that the sole and exclusive responsibility

998
01:38:03,800 --> 01:38:09,400
of corporations is to extract maximum shareholder profit. If you don't do those things,

999
01:38:09,400 --> 01:38:15,880
you're dead in the water, right? Because the ratchets all go towards a governance system,

1000
01:38:15,880 --> 01:38:21,960
a capitalization table, legally enforceable incentives, and court of law. I mean, there's

1001
01:38:21,960 --> 01:38:26,440
situations now where because of that notion of corporations as persons, there are in

1002
01:38:26,440 --> 01:38:33,560
international courts, nations are being sued by multinational corporations for daring to enact

1003
01:38:33,560 --> 01:38:38,120
environmental policies that protect their streams, their rivers, their watersheds, their topsoil,

1004
01:38:38,200 --> 01:38:43,400
and their people at the expense of maximum optimized profitability for the multinational

1005
01:38:43,400 --> 01:38:50,040
corporation and the multinationals are winning. So you have situations like that and you're like,

1006
01:38:50,040 --> 01:38:54,680
okay, that's a stitch up. That's not actually, doesn't matter how many do-gooders, doesn't

1007
01:38:54,680 --> 01:38:59,080
matter how many, you know, Twitter campaigns or Instagrams, you know, social, you know, click,

1008
01:38:59,080 --> 01:39:07,000
click and click and like, and follow the activists. None of that can work if the rule of law is so

1009
01:39:07,640 --> 01:39:11,320
hijacked and compromised by these perverse incentives that are now legally enshrined.

1010
01:39:12,200 --> 01:39:16,600
So back to your original question, can this be done on an individual level versus on a collective

1011
01:39:16,600 --> 01:39:24,840
level? For sure, you know, we have to come from, you know, love, light, consciousness, inclusion,

1012
01:39:24,840 --> 01:39:31,160
hopefully some joy, hopefully some play, right? Some sense of this is worth doing together, right?

1013
01:39:31,160 --> 01:39:38,760
And there are absolutely technical, legal, structural conditions that until those are

1014
01:39:38,760 --> 01:39:46,680
dislodged, right, they will, they will block and undermine even the best of intentions.

1015
01:39:48,680 --> 01:39:55,160
That's a brilliant point. And I guess I lean more towards the individual side because I've

1016
01:39:55,160 --> 01:39:58,840
lately, I've lost so much faith in our institutions and our governments,

1017
01:39:59,480 --> 01:40:05,400
and I've seen the power of what an individual change can have on the world, you know, you

1018
01:40:05,400 --> 01:40:11,720
change yourself, you change the world. And so like, to the tribalism, to the capitalism, colonialism

1019
01:40:11,720 --> 01:40:17,160
on each of those levels, like, if the individual says, hey, I'm not, we're not going to support

1020
01:40:17,160 --> 01:40:23,080
any products that have this chemical in it, we're done. The market is going to have to adjust,

1021
01:40:23,160 --> 01:40:27,960
right? I mean, look how many people want organic food now, and are rejecting the pesticides.

1022
01:40:27,960 --> 01:40:33,080
There's a huge demand for products that don't have plastic anymore, because people are now aware of

1023
01:40:33,080 --> 01:40:38,280
how harmful phthalates are to our endocrine systems. You know, it's, it's because people are

1024
01:40:38,280 --> 01:40:44,200
getting more aware that it's putting this demand on the companies, and the market has to adjust to

1025
01:40:44,200 --> 01:40:51,080
that, that individual epiphany. And so you can apply that to colonialism and tribalism, like,

1026
01:40:51,080 --> 01:40:56,920
if you realize that we're all one, and that anything that I do to hurt another person

1027
01:40:56,920 --> 01:41:02,920
will hurt me in the end, and that by destroying the forest, I'm really just destroying myself.

1028
01:41:04,440 --> 01:41:11,000
Those deep understandings can kind of make tribalism and colonialism deteriorate, I think.

1029
01:41:11,720 --> 01:41:17,320
Maybe that's just like a, you know, that's a very utopian vision. But I do feel like I've seen

1030
01:41:17,320 --> 01:41:24,600
people who have become, I guess, enlightened, not to sound cliche. And I've seen how much they,

1031
01:41:24,600 --> 01:41:28,760
they step away from things that are harming the world, and how much good they can do,

1032
01:41:29,640 --> 01:41:33,160
just one person, and how that spreads throughout a community.

1033
01:41:35,480 --> 01:41:41,160
Yeah, absolutely. And to me, that almost lives in a, that lives in another and distinct and very,

1034
01:41:41,240 --> 01:41:48,360
very important category, which is, and it's what I literally, it was the central thesis of the last

1035
01:41:48,360 --> 01:41:53,400
book I wrote, Recapture the Rapture, which was, hey, look, all of our technical tactical solutions

1036
01:41:54,120 --> 01:41:58,280
probably aren't going to pencil out, right? We're trying, we're bargaining, we're hoping,

1037
01:41:58,280 --> 01:42:01,800
we're innovating, we're delaying, we're stalling, we're, you know, like all of it, like, it's just,

1038
01:42:01,800 --> 01:42:08,760
it's a shit show, and the math doesn't work. But, right, there is this thing that happens

1039
01:42:08,760 --> 01:42:13,240
once in a blue moon, and we talked about King Mandela Gandhi, but there's a lot of others,

1040
01:42:13,240 --> 01:42:19,240
right? Where singular isolated acts of human love, creativity, and courage. I mean,

1041
01:42:19,240 --> 01:42:24,840
Banksy is another example, like Banksy is just wildly on point almost all the time,

1042
01:42:24,840 --> 01:42:30,440
and he's an anonymous artist that just does street art. But he's always like, hey, he's kind of like

1043
01:42:30,440 --> 01:42:36,520
this cosmic prankster trickster, and he makes millions of humans think differently, right?

1044
01:42:36,520 --> 01:42:41,320
Think about Tankman in Tiananmen Square, right, where he just stood in front of the tanks, he

1045
01:42:41,320 --> 01:42:45,240
had shopping bags, he was tired, he just kind of come home from work, he didn't plan it, right?

1046
01:42:45,240 --> 01:42:50,520
He's just like, fuck this, right? And then he was whisked off, spirited away, like no one knows

1047
01:42:50,520 --> 01:42:55,080
what happened to him afterwards, and yet we all know who we're talking about, Tankman in Tiananmen

1048
01:42:55,080 --> 01:43:01,000
Square, right? The cellist of Sarajevo in the midst of the Yugoslavian Civil War with all sorts of

1049
01:43:01,000 --> 01:43:06,280
atrocities, in the bummed out rubble of Sarajevo, he just sat down on a chair and just played

1050
01:43:07,480 --> 01:43:11,240
every night at sunset, and the snipers on both sides didn't kill him.

1051
01:43:12,360 --> 01:43:18,920
Everybody was yearning for that glimpse of humanity, of beauty, in the midst of all of that

1052
01:43:19,560 --> 01:43:28,120
horror, right? And he changed the tide of things, however slightly. You know, the example I always

1053
01:43:28,120 --> 01:43:33,640
go back to is, you know, the band, you know, the band played on, on the Titanic, right? A string

1054
01:43:33,640 --> 01:43:40,840
quartet who didn't scrap for those remaining seats in the lifeboats. They let the women and children

1055
01:43:40,840 --> 01:43:47,880
go first, realized their goose was thoroughly cooked, and didn't just succumb to being panicky

1056
01:43:47,880 --> 01:43:53,080
scared people. They said, what is our Dharma? What are we here to do? What are we given our lives to?

1057
01:43:53,080 --> 01:43:57,240
And why were we here on this ship in the first place? It was because we are the musicians.

1058
01:43:58,200 --> 01:44:01,240
And so, you know, Buddhism 101, seek refuge in the Dharma.

1059
01:44:02,200 --> 01:44:06,120
They sought refuge in it, and the tune they played was, nearer my God to thee,

1060
01:44:08,120 --> 01:44:11,480
right? So at a time where they could have succumbed to self-interest, where they could have

1061
01:44:11,480 --> 01:44:16,920
been kicking and screaming, they could have been just in survival instincts. They instead

1062
01:44:16,920 --> 01:44:21,400
elevated up. And we might not remember their names, but we remember what they did,

1063
01:44:21,720 --> 01:44:28,680
and we tell those stories. You know, the more kind of agro macho one would be, you know,

1064
01:44:28,680 --> 01:44:35,400
King Leonidas on the Spartans at Thermopylae, right? Against the Persian hordes, you know,

1065
01:44:35,400 --> 01:44:39,960
and today, today we fight in the shade, right? Because there's that many arrows coming our way,

1066
01:44:39,960 --> 01:44:47,080
like those acts of courage and heroism. Gandhi called it Satyagraha, which means truth force,

1067
01:44:48,040 --> 01:44:53,320
when it made its way back to the United States via Howard Thurman to Martin Luther King, it became

1068
01:44:53,320 --> 01:44:59,720
soul force. And MLK even mentions that in his I Have a Dream speech. He says, well, we can meet,

1069
01:44:59,720 --> 01:45:04,360
when we can meet physical force through the majestic heights of soul force,

1070
01:45:05,000 --> 01:45:09,560
right? Then we have a chance to turn things on a dime. And so that thought being is like, well, what

1071
01:45:09,560 --> 01:45:19,800
if what if we could scale soul force? What if there are ways to have more humans, some tiny

1072
01:45:19,800 --> 01:45:24,760
critical mass of people on Erica Chenoweth at the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard has

1073
01:45:24,760 --> 01:45:29,240
famously pegged that at three and a half percent of a population, whether that's still true or

1074
01:45:29,240 --> 01:45:33,560
deeply true, or you know, will be will be true playing forward, don't know. But let's just say

1075
01:45:33,560 --> 01:45:38,680
we're not there yet. So let's get there and see how it looks from there. Right? What is the possibility

1076
01:45:38,680 --> 01:45:46,520
of three and a half percent of humans accessing their own truth force, their own soul force,

1077
01:45:46,520 --> 01:45:53,880
and then making just sending out that EMP of humanity, of courage, of truth,

1078
01:45:54,760 --> 01:45:58,360
and just bearing witness to it and then like and then let the chips fall, right? It's not that those

1079
01:45:58,360 --> 01:46:03,880
guys were fiddling on the Titanic in the hopes that the Coast Guard was going to hear them and

1080
01:46:03,880 --> 01:46:10,440
pick them up. Right? They're like soul force is is my life is forfeit. None of us get out of here

1081
01:46:10,440 --> 01:46:21,320
alive. I already I know this and accept it. Now what? Right? Now what? And that is where the beginning

1082
01:46:21,320 --> 01:46:25,720
of something profound could happen. I mean, you know, and on a very tactical example,

1083
01:46:25,720 --> 01:46:29,480
like a counterfactual, because you're like, Oh, three and a half percent of people being super

1084
01:46:29,480 --> 01:46:31,880
groovy. Is that really going to change things? You're like, Well, actually, look at what happens

1085
01:46:31,880 --> 01:46:37,320
when a tiny percentage of people are super shitty. So our friend Tristan Harris and Azar Askin at the

1086
01:46:37,320 --> 01:46:41,960
Center for Humane Tech, they did the social dilemma that big documentary on social media ills

1087
01:46:43,800 --> 01:46:49,880
found research that was basically saying that 90% of all social media of all generated social media

1088
01:46:49,880 --> 01:46:59,320
that all of us read is created by 5% of the people on the furthest extremes. So 90% of social media

1089
01:46:59,320 --> 01:47:03,400
is created by 10% of the humans, you know, half and half on either side of the political spectrum.

1090
01:47:03,960 --> 01:47:09,560
And a subsequent study down in Australia found that those folks that are on the far extremes

1091
01:47:10,120 --> 01:47:15,720
score off the charts for dark triad personality types and authoritarianism. So narcissism,

1092
01:47:15,720 --> 01:47:23,720
sociopathy, Machiavellianism and authoritarianism are the 10% of the humans generating 90% of what

1093
01:47:23,800 --> 01:47:29,240
we all read and view, which is absolutely insane because how many people scroll through their

1094
01:47:29,240 --> 01:47:35,240
social media are like, I hate humans. We're screwed. You know, I don't want to be a part of this

1095
01:47:35,240 --> 01:47:40,040
civilization or this society. It's a totally logical conclusion. It's just that it's not

1096
01:47:40,600 --> 01:47:47,320
the 90% of the humans in the middle. 90% of the humans in the middle want a chance to live

1097
01:47:47,960 --> 01:47:52,120
a better life than their parents had and give a better life to their kids and die in their sleep

1098
01:47:52,120 --> 01:47:58,360
surrounded by their grandchildren. Like that has always been what most of us want.

1099
01:47:59,560 --> 01:48:07,480
And so breaking through those false barriers, those algorithmically optimized notions of

1100
01:48:07,480 --> 01:48:15,240
separation and frustration and getting back to mutuality and connection where we see each

1101
01:48:15,240 --> 01:48:20,440
other's humanity and we recognize that there's something worth defending and protecting here

1102
01:48:21,320 --> 01:48:25,960
does feel super important. So to your question, like surely, hey, is there something about the

1103
01:48:25,960 --> 01:48:31,000
individual? It absolutely has to be done at this level. And there is something asymmetrically

1104
01:48:31,000 --> 01:48:36,600
different than I'm just going to yoga and using my breath work app and my headspace and my ice

1105
01:48:36,600 --> 01:48:42,120
bath. And this is all about me as a co-opted neoliberal capitalist consumer of late stage

1106
01:48:42,120 --> 01:48:48,280
capitalism, right? Like that version doesn't go anywhere. That is a that is a insidious

1107
01:48:48,280 --> 01:48:53,640
stall and diversion tactic of the people with the greatest privilege from their social civic

1108
01:48:53,640 --> 01:49:00,520
political responsibilities. But stepping into the deeper prospect of what happens if a bunch of us,

1109
01:49:01,160 --> 01:49:05,800
some critical mass of us actually access our soul force and take a stand and say enough is enough.

1110
01:49:06,920 --> 01:49:09,880
I am here to bear witness to the least of my brothers and sisters,

1111
01:49:11,000 --> 01:49:15,160
you know, on behalf of goodness, truth and beauty for as long as it takes.

1112
01:49:15,560 --> 01:49:18,760
That feels like a game with playing.

1113
01:49:21,400 --> 01:49:27,320
Absolutely. And I love how this conversation just flowed naturally. We we I haven't even gotten

1114
01:49:27,320 --> 01:49:33,080
to my first question that I wrote down. No way. But but I love how this has just been an organic

1115
01:49:33,080 --> 01:49:37,640
flow. The questions have just come naturally. But I think this leads into the first question

1116
01:49:37,640 --> 01:49:43,080
that I wrote down. I've seen a incredible rise in cynicism. And I spent a lot of my time reading

1117
01:49:43,080 --> 01:49:48,840
comments online. And it seems like that must suck. You know, I know it's a bad habit, but

1118
01:49:50,520 --> 01:49:55,560
a lot of the comments I get on my channel are very genuine. You know, they're not not trolls.

1119
01:49:56,120 --> 01:50:00,280
So I take most of them seriously into consideration. And, you know, I like,

1120
01:50:00,920 --> 01:50:05,240
I get a lot of positive comments on my channels. I think it's rare, because a lot of the comments,

1121
01:50:05,960 --> 01:50:10,920
a lot of the feedback is positive. But I've just just scrolling online, I see so much cynicism.

1122
01:50:11,000 --> 01:50:15,160
And just even in the titles of videos, everything's kind of like, let's take something that

1123
01:50:15,800 --> 01:50:18,360
most people think is good. And let's talk about how it's actually terrible.

1124
01:50:19,320 --> 01:50:23,880
And I feel like there's so many takes like, if you want to make a viral video that gets a lot of

1125
01:50:23,880 --> 01:50:28,280
attention, you just pick something that a lot of people think to be true. And then you say how

1126
01:50:28,280 --> 01:50:35,080
it's false. You know, if I made a video right now that said AI is actually past its prime, it's peaked.

1127
01:50:36,040 --> 01:50:40,920
Most people think that AI is advancing super fast. But if I make a take that's

1128
01:50:41,480 --> 01:50:45,400
the opposite to what most people think, even if it's completely unfounded,

1129
01:50:45,960 --> 01:50:49,960
that take is going to get a lot of attention. And I think a lot of content creators have

1130
01:50:50,600 --> 01:50:55,640
kind of figured out that hack. And so they're just, the internet is flooded with these

1131
01:50:56,760 --> 01:51:04,360
contrarian takes, you know what I'm saying? And I think it's led to people not knowing what's

1132
01:51:04,360 --> 01:51:10,760
true anymore. And the natural response is just cynicism. And cynicism has gotten confused with

1133
01:51:10,760 --> 01:51:18,680
intelligence. Like, even in movies, if you see somebody who's like, happy, go lucky, we think,

1134
01:51:18,680 --> 01:51:25,080
oh, that person must be ignorant. And the person that's always like, very skeptical is seen as

1135
01:51:25,080 --> 01:51:30,520
the intelligent one. So like this cynicism has been connected with intelligence and people,

1136
01:51:30,600 --> 01:51:35,720
their natural response now is just to, okay, let me just not trust anything. Let me just

1137
01:51:35,720 --> 01:51:40,440
think that everything's bad. Have you also noticed this rise in cynicism?

1138
01:51:41,800 --> 01:51:50,680
Yeah, so I mean, the symbol answer is, is for sure. It does feel like there is a spike in,

1139
01:51:51,960 --> 01:51:57,800
you know, nothing is true. Nothing is trustworthy. Even the thing, even our sacred cows,

1140
01:51:57,800 --> 01:52:02,600
that we used to sort of think we're up and above that, like Abraham Lincoln and Thomas Jefferson

1141
01:52:02,600 --> 01:52:06,840
and George Washington will actually turned out they were slaveholders or misogynists or something,

1142
01:52:06,840 --> 01:52:10,840
you know, something along those lines, like, is there any one, is there any thing? And again,

1143
01:52:10,840 --> 01:52:17,080
even back to, you know, enlightenment values, or the American experiment, you know, or whatever it

1144
01:52:17,080 --> 01:52:25,080
might be, there's somebody taking a sledgehammer or a chisel to all of our, you know, monuments,

1145
01:52:25,080 --> 01:52:28,680
to all of the edifices to the things that we have, we used to potentially, you know,

1146
01:52:29,720 --> 01:52:34,920
accept more at face value. And we had spoken a little bit earlier about how things are getting

1147
01:52:34,920 --> 01:52:39,400
exponentially better and exponentially worse at the same time. And that's overwhelming.

1148
01:52:40,200 --> 01:52:44,520
So at the same time, that just, you know, everything from the complexities and the

1149
01:52:44,520 --> 01:52:49,640
consequences of our current moment, which is just sort of objective, plus the massively

1150
01:52:49,640 --> 01:52:53,400
accelerated amount of information we all have access to through our super smart smartphones,

1151
01:52:53,400 --> 01:52:56,360
you know, constantly bombarding us at all times. And I read something that

1152
01:52:57,000 --> 01:53:00,680
basically a Sunday edition of the New York Times, just as thick as that is,

1153
01:53:01,480 --> 01:53:05,800
was as much information as a monk in the Middle Ages consumed in his lifetime.

1154
01:53:08,040 --> 01:53:13,400
And we're getting that before breakfast every day. You know, it's, it's, it's, it's

1155
01:53:13,400 --> 01:53:19,960
a certain bananas, right? So at the same time that we have this huge spike in both volume and

1156
01:53:19,960 --> 01:53:26,840
consequence of the information we're consuming, we've had a loss in our familiar landmarks.

1157
01:53:27,880 --> 01:53:33,080
And you can kind of say, you know, sort of meaning 1.0 was that notion of organized religion. And

1158
01:53:33,080 --> 01:53:36,920
that was your sacred scriptures and your priests and your community rabbis, you know, imams in

1159
01:53:36,920 --> 01:53:40,360
your community, they told you what was what they told you where you lived in the world and your

1160
01:53:40,360 --> 01:53:43,560
universe and how to be and what to do, et cetera, et cetera. And if there was something weird,

1161
01:53:43,560 --> 01:53:47,640
like a comet or a meteor or, you know, or a strange happening, you went to them and they

1162
01:53:47,640 --> 01:53:53,080
told you what to think about it. So that was our overwhelming and dominant source of information

1163
01:53:54,280 --> 01:54:00,680
until the last three, 400 years of increasingly the advent of modern liberalism and not meaning

1164
01:54:00,680 --> 01:54:04,840
Democrat, but just meaning that the Enlightenment experiment, the combinations of science,

1165
01:54:04,840 --> 01:54:09,240
of empiricism, of rule of law, of civil liberties and all of those kinds of things. And those are

1166
01:54:09,240 --> 01:54:14,760
the institutions like everything from the CDC and the WHO, right, to the World Bank, to the

1167
01:54:14,760 --> 01:54:20,120
United Nations, to, you know, Yale and Harvard and MIT and all of our institutions, to McKinsey

1168
01:54:20,120 --> 01:54:27,080
and Goldman Sachs, right, like all of those kind of icons. And, you know, for the first time ever,

1169
01:54:27,080 --> 01:54:32,840
we've had the collapse in both of those pillars at the same time that we're having this exponential

1170
01:54:32,840 --> 01:54:39,160
complexity. So we're more in need of trusted and trustworthy voices to tell us which ends up

1171
01:54:39,880 --> 01:54:45,800
at the same time that they've both collapsed. So the roof is kind of caved in on our separation of

1172
01:54:45,800 --> 01:54:52,600
church and state, kind of modern liberal secular societies. And into that vacuum, you're getting

1173
01:54:52,600 --> 01:54:59,080
people pulled to fundamentalism on one side, which is like, it's too big, it's too scary out there,

1174
01:54:59,080 --> 01:55:04,360
just give me something, anything to sink my teeth into, believe a rock to cling to, just tell me

1175
01:55:04,360 --> 01:55:12,600
what that might be. And on the other side, nihilism, like I give up, this is hopeless. There is no

1176
01:55:12,600 --> 01:55:17,480
there, there, we are just in a cyclic creation and destruction, there is no higher purpose or power,

1177
01:55:17,480 --> 01:55:23,400
there is no times arrow direction to where we're going. This is just more of the same shit. So

1178
01:55:23,400 --> 01:55:28,440
your naming of the cynicism, you can make a case, either you put that in that in the nihilism bucket,

1179
01:55:28,440 --> 01:55:33,000
it's just a flavor of that, right, or you could say that's somehow hanging out in the middle,

1180
01:55:33,720 --> 01:55:40,600
you know, where you are sort of perversely incented to kick down anything anyone believes,

1181
01:55:41,480 --> 01:55:46,520
right, because you have no faith that there's something more to be had. And cynicism and

1182
01:55:46,520 --> 01:55:51,640
hedonism, I think, often pair together, right? If there's nothing, if there's no other better

1183
01:55:51,640 --> 01:55:57,080
game to play, and I can go around kicking down everybody's sandcastles, then the only thing

1184
01:55:57,080 --> 01:56:04,120
left to do is for me to get mine, right, seek pleasure, avoid pain, you know, and that might

1185
01:56:04,120 --> 01:56:09,480
even be clicks and likes and trolling, that might be pleasurable to me. So, you know, and so that's

1186
01:56:09,480 --> 01:56:16,360
not just sort of an abstract theoretical model, right, is it predictive? Does it help its mind?

1187
01:56:16,360 --> 01:56:21,400
You're like, oh, look what's happening with fundamentalism, like not only are we seeing a

1188
01:56:21,400 --> 01:56:26,840
resurgence in that in organized religions, but you're seeing some weird ass hybrids, you're seeing,

1189
01:56:26,840 --> 01:56:32,200
you know, there was just a piece this about three months ago on the rise of orthobros,

1190
01:56:32,840 --> 01:56:39,720
right, which was Eastern Orthodox Christian, you know, sort of Joe Rogan, podcaster, guns and

1191
01:56:39,720 --> 01:56:45,480
steroid MMA guys, getting into Eastern Orthodoxy in Houston. So a huge, and they've even taken

1192
01:56:45,480 --> 01:56:53,880
over the Eastern Orthodox communities in Houston, Texas. And a colleague of ours, Isabella, Tara

1193
01:56:53,880 --> 01:56:59,080
Isabella Burton, who wrote a great book called Strange Rights, which is kind of everything from

1194
01:56:59,080 --> 01:57:03,080
Burning Man and Soul Cycle to all these weird expressions of religiosity in the contemporary

1195
01:57:03,080 --> 01:57:10,040
world. She's written in the New York Times about the the basically the return to extreme

1196
01:57:10,040 --> 01:57:15,240
orthodoxies in Catholic like folks like young people, millennials are going in New York City

1197
01:57:15,240 --> 01:57:20,520
are getting pulled into like Latin masses. They're like the older and the sort of more

1198
01:57:20,520 --> 01:57:25,000
code based. And the more tell me what to do, the more I'm going to get off on it. It's almost

1199
01:57:25,000 --> 01:57:30,920
like a sort of existential kink. It's a little bit like being a submissive in BDSM. It's like

1200
01:57:30,920 --> 01:57:37,480
I've just spent a decade all about me, clicking on insert posts, going to yoga retreats in Bali,

1201
01:57:37,480 --> 01:57:42,520
doing medicine ceremonies, like learning my attachment styles, you know, da da da healing

1202
01:57:42,520 --> 01:57:49,160
my ancestral trauma. And it is fucking exhausting. And I don't feel any better off at all. And all I

1203
01:57:49,160 --> 01:57:55,080
want is somebody to tell me what to think and what to believe. So you have even that from like

1204
01:57:55,080 --> 01:57:59,000
the progressive kind of New Age self help left, you have a return to people are just, you know,

1205
01:57:59,000 --> 01:58:03,560
and Russell Brand converted to Christianity. We have several other mutual friends that have

1206
01:58:03,560 --> 01:58:09,560
just recently come out and sort of stated their claim of returning to Christianity. Jordan Peterson

1207
01:58:09,560 --> 01:58:17,480
has been a voice of right kind of traditionalist classical values and meaning. Here's what's her

1208
01:58:17,480 --> 01:58:23,560
name. I hear some Ali, I think she might have a first name, but it's it's Nile Ferguson's wife

1209
01:58:23,560 --> 01:58:31,240
and partner. She very publicly recently left Islam altogether as her family of origin faith,

1210
01:58:31,880 --> 01:58:38,440
and converted to Christianity. So you're seeing, you know, and then throw in wing nut conspiracy

1211
01:58:38,440 --> 01:58:43,000
theories like QAnon. So those are all expressions of heightened fundamentalism. You're like,

1212
01:58:43,000 --> 01:58:48,600
yep, okay, that was the model seemed like if we don't have solid pillars to hold up our consensus

1213
01:58:48,600 --> 01:58:55,320
reality together, we're all fragmenting and fracturing. And then the nihilism side, you're

1214
01:58:55,320 --> 01:59:05,400
seeing that, you know, I think 50, maybe it was, I think it was 54% of Gen Z surveyed in the United

1215
01:59:05,400 --> 01:59:10,440
States by Pew Research Foundation concluded that they would they would find a military dictatorship

1216
01:59:10,440 --> 01:59:16,920
preferable to representative democracy. And you're like, whoa, okay, that's that's not something

1217
01:59:16,920 --> 01:59:21,560
that's been around for a long time. The recent European parliamentary elections have shown a

1218
01:59:21,560 --> 01:59:29,080
significant rightward shift. And it's getting into the kind of burn it all down territory,

1219
01:59:29,080 --> 01:59:32,600
where people are not, you know, you would used to think that like two parties didn't really matter

1220
01:59:32,600 --> 01:59:36,840
which side you were on, everybody would agree to play by the rules of this great nation we were

1221
01:59:36,840 --> 01:59:42,680
founded on or whatever, you know, or European cultures and governance traditions. And now you're

1222
01:59:42,680 --> 01:59:49,720
having many, many more people in the hashtag burn it all down category. This is marabund. This is

1223
01:59:49,720 --> 01:59:53,800
corrupt. This never should have happened in the first place, or it was a good idea, but it's

1224
01:59:53,800 --> 01:59:57,880
fatally tainted now. And the best thing to do is just bulldoze the whole thing. This is not a fixer

1225
01:59:57,880 --> 02:00:03,560
rapper. Right. This is buy it for the lot and scrape this thing and start again, C steadying

1226
02:00:03,560 --> 02:00:08,360
cryptocurrencies, all those guys have breakaway civilization ideas. And then how's it just

1227
02:00:08,360 --> 02:00:15,240
happening for most people, for most people that are pulled into the nihilism. It's just personally

1228
02:00:15,240 --> 02:00:19,800
and psychologically and emotionally overwhelming. So those folks aren't on Twitter, and they're

1229
02:00:19,800 --> 02:00:23,080
not hatching, you know, they're not hatching plans for breakaway societies or, you know,

1230
02:00:23,080 --> 02:00:27,880
or following Steve Bannon to some fascist retreat in the Italian Alps, right, those people are just

1231
02:00:27,880 --> 02:00:35,960
succumbing to diseases of despair, addiction, depression, anxiety, suicide. And so that is

1232
02:00:35,960 --> 02:00:41,480
what we're seeing at this point. And so the question is, is into that vacuum, we would expect

1233
02:00:41,480 --> 02:00:51,000
to see all sorts of cultic communities arise. Right. Give me a charismatic, demagogic leader,

1234
02:00:51,000 --> 02:00:57,800
give me someone who's pulling the juice, right, who has a certainty that is persuasive or compelling.

1235
02:00:58,440 --> 02:01:02,920
And that can promise me that all that I'm seeing and experiencing right now isn't,

1236
02:01:03,480 --> 02:01:08,600
isn't wrong or bad or my fault. There's someone or something to blame. There's always something

1237
02:01:08,600 --> 02:01:16,120
or someone to blame because that's the tribalism DNA. Right. And we can get to a happily ever after

1238
02:01:16,120 --> 02:01:24,280
if you only follow me, join us, do the thing, which is a rapturous ideology. Like the world,

1239
02:01:24,280 --> 02:01:29,720
you're right, the world is screwed up, it's fucked up, it's irredeemable. And we're coming

1240
02:01:29,720 --> 02:01:34,280
to an inflection point really soon where everything changes. Right. That could be the

1241
02:01:34,280 --> 02:01:38,200
revolution, that could be the rapture, it could be whatever it is. It could be artificial general

1242
02:01:38,200 --> 02:01:43,640
intelligence at some point soon, we can see it from here if we squint. It's coming. So get ready

1243
02:01:43,640 --> 02:01:49,800
and follow me because here's the deal on the other side of that inflection point. Us, our tribe,

1244
02:01:49,800 --> 02:01:55,960
we come up roses. We're actually better off on the other side. So let's get there as fast as possible.

1245
02:01:57,320 --> 02:02:03,880
Right. And hop on board. And those rapture ideologies, they show up in fundamentalist

1246
02:02:03,880 --> 02:02:07,800
religion, but they also show up in techno utopianism. They show up in Silicon Valley with Ray Cozwell

1247
02:02:07,800 --> 02:02:15,080
and Peter Diamandis and Mark Andreessen. Right. They show up in, the storm is coming and QAnon

1248
02:02:15,080 --> 02:02:20,680
stuff. Right. You see them everywhere. They show up in crypto, hodl, you know, like, and then there's

1249
02:02:20,680 --> 02:02:26,040
going to be some collapse in fiat currency and then everybody holding fat Bitcoin and ETH wallets

1250
02:02:26,040 --> 02:02:31,880
will come up roses and we'll have a debt jubilee and we'll reboot the entire global financial

1251
02:02:31,880 --> 02:02:39,640
systems. Right. Everybody's peddling some version of that. And they sell hope because they all

1252
02:02:39,640 --> 02:02:45,880
promise to leapfrog the train wreck that's in front of us. And the train wreck is much harder to sort

1253
02:02:45,880 --> 02:02:51,560
out. So it's like, well, we're not even going to sort it out. And in fact, our buddy Doug Rushkoff,

1254
02:02:51,560 --> 02:02:57,960
who wrote team human and doomsday prep for the super rich, even called it the mindset in Silicon

1255
02:02:57,960 --> 02:03:03,000
Valley in particular, because he was he was brought by like five hedge fund guys flown out to some

1256
02:03:03,000 --> 02:03:07,320
super secret desert compound and given tens of thousands of dollars to give a talk. And he thought

1257
02:03:07,320 --> 02:03:11,480
he was giving a real talk. And then he realized, oh, these guys, there's no one to talk to you. It's

1258
02:03:11,480 --> 02:03:14,840
not like they're whole stable of traders that he was here to talk to. It was just them. And they

1259
02:03:14,840 --> 02:03:20,680
wanted to grill him on the apocalypse. And he identified, which I thought was a brilliant move,

1260
02:03:20,680 --> 02:03:25,160
the mindset. And he called it with a capital M, the mindset. And the mindset is fundamentally,

1261
02:03:25,240 --> 02:03:31,800
you know, not unique to Silicon Valley, but ubiquitous in Silicon Valley of, hey,

1262
02:03:32,600 --> 02:03:37,240
never mind all these messy human problems, never mind our cultural history, never mind

1263
02:03:37,240 --> 02:03:42,840
our government, never mind rules and regulations, never mind any of that. We'll we'll we just want

1264
02:03:42,840 --> 02:03:49,960
a blank piece of paper to rebuild our utopian vision on. So we're not going to engage in humanity.

1265
02:03:49,960 --> 02:03:54,120
This is a bunch of sort of Asperger guys, you know, fundamentally, like,

1266
02:03:54,120 --> 02:03:59,800
under socialized, not especially well-mammaled, rarely in the company or the accountability

1267
02:03:59,800 --> 02:04:05,720
of a good strong woman, imagining these fictive scenarios where it's up and out.

1268
02:04:06,920 --> 02:04:10,760
And whether that's Mars or whether that's some, you know, real estate we bought in, you know,

1269
02:04:10,760 --> 02:04:15,160
inland, inland from the Bay Area and we're rebooting there or, you know, or it's, you know,

1270
02:04:15,160 --> 02:04:23,960
offshore or or it's wherever. And and that tends to be a situation that almost always

1271
02:04:25,080 --> 02:04:29,080
is a one percenter solution. However you slice the one percent, it could be

1272
02:04:29,080 --> 02:04:33,080
that worth, but it could be the morally elect or saved, it could be the intelligent and the

1273
02:04:33,080 --> 02:04:36,920
brilliant, it could be the holders of my certain crypto coin, it could be whomever,

1274
02:04:36,920 --> 02:04:43,320
but it's a one percenter play that leaves 99 percent of humanity and all the four-leggeds,

1275
02:04:43,320 --> 02:04:46,840
you know, and the winged and the finned and everybody, you know, all the other creatures on

1276
02:04:46,840 --> 02:04:53,960
this earth with the short end of that straw. So that's what brings us back to what are solutions,

1277
02:04:53,960 --> 02:04:59,960
what's a civilizational calculus that works for everyone, everywhere, everyone. All of us are

1278
02:04:59,960 --> 02:05:07,080
none of us, just as an ethical pledge. And this planet, you know, no fucking off to space if we

1279
02:05:08,040 --> 02:05:15,160
trashed Eden and we're trying to reconstruct habitable environments out of completely contrived

1280
02:05:15,160 --> 02:05:21,400
situations like not going to happen. These bodies, right, the idea of not becoming cyborgs,

1281
02:05:21,400 --> 02:05:27,800
actually honoring these beautiful organisms that we've been gifted with being self-aware within

1282
02:05:28,680 --> 02:05:35,080
and this lifetime, you know, not punting to life, indefinite life extension

1283
02:05:35,720 --> 02:05:44,680
for a fortunate few, but to say we fully embrace this human lifespan, we fully embrace this earth,

1284
02:05:44,680 --> 02:05:53,000
we fully embrace our bodies to take a stand for all of us, right? On behalf of the good,

1285
02:05:53,000 --> 02:05:58,040
the true and the beautiful, I mean, none of this is new, right? This is, if you think about

1286
02:05:59,000 --> 02:06:05,720
what we see on Instagram and TikTok these days, where we are constantly shouted at and whispered

1287
02:06:05,720 --> 02:06:15,160
at and promised and seduced to believe that you can have it all now in just three easy steps,

1288
02:06:16,360 --> 02:06:23,240
right? Like scan the world's wisdom traditions, scan every saint, sage, and philosopher that has

1289
02:06:23,240 --> 02:06:29,320
ever lived and left a mark in our collective consciousness and not a single one of them

1290
02:06:29,320 --> 02:06:38,840
has said anything remotely that juvenile, self-obsessed or perverse. You know, what have they said?

1291
02:06:38,840 --> 02:06:45,640
They've said, hey, life's a mixed bag, right? I mean, I defer to, there's that old, old Yeller,

1292
02:06:45,640 --> 02:06:50,520
was a famous Disney movie about a kid who adopts a dog. We actually listened to it as we were

1293
02:06:50,520 --> 02:06:54,200
moving our family to Austin. I'm like, oh, great. I remember old Yeller. We'll do a book on tape.

1294
02:06:54,200 --> 02:06:57,800
That'll be the road trip. As it turns out, of course, with all dog movies and all horse movies,

1295
02:06:57,800 --> 02:07:01,640
the dog doesn't make it. He gets, he defends them and he gets bitten by a wolf or a coyote.

1296
02:07:01,640 --> 02:07:05,640
He gets rabies. They have to put him down, right? So the sun is broken up, as were our kids in the

1297
02:07:05,640 --> 02:07:10,360
backseat. They're like, dad, we are never, ever listening to another book on tape about a dog

1298
02:07:10,360 --> 02:07:15,560
again. And the dad's sitting on the rocking chair on their, on their ranch house. And he's like, son,

1299
02:07:16,440 --> 02:07:21,720
the way I, the best, the way I figure it, you know, about half a life is good parts

1300
02:07:21,720 --> 02:07:28,440
and half a life is bad parts. But if you spend all the good parts worrying about all the bad parts,

1301
02:07:28,440 --> 02:07:38,040
why, then it's all bad. You know, and that's, that's St. Francis, Augustine, Buddha, Lao Tzu,

1302
02:07:38,680 --> 02:07:43,960
right? You know, like, they, they all acknowledge life's a bitch and then we die.

1303
02:07:45,320 --> 02:07:50,920
And then there's inevitably the, so what do we do about that in the in-between?

1304
02:07:51,880 --> 02:07:58,040
And my sense right now, and maybe we can, maybe we can even wrap with this, right,

1305
02:07:58,040 --> 02:08:01,960
is how to find hope. What, what is the antidote to cynicism, right? The antidote to cynicism is

1306
02:08:01,960 --> 02:08:10,520
a point on a purpose. And Joanna Macy, who's a Zen grandmother and, you know, one of the most

1307
02:08:11,640 --> 02:08:19,560
profound ecologists and activists of her generation, she's described our time in history,

1308
02:08:20,280 --> 02:08:25,560
right, as being the people of the passage. Like it is on us to get from here to there.

1309
02:08:26,040 --> 02:08:31,000
And if you think about the, you know, the settlement of the Western Hemisphere, like arguably through

1310
02:08:31,000 --> 02:08:38,360
the land bridge, right, between Asia and Alaska, Beringia, right? We are all Beringians now,

1311
02:08:39,640 --> 02:08:47,800
but in time, not space, right? So where like 15,000 Asian nomads shimmied across that in little boats

1312
02:08:47,800 --> 02:08:52,520
and, you know, on foot and in the ice ages and various bits and pieces to make it and populate

1313
02:08:52,520 --> 02:08:58,360
this entire half the world. We're doing that in time. Like there's a constraint coming. There's a

1314
02:08:58,360 --> 02:09:04,680
constraint coming, which is how do we transition off this hyper-consumptive, right, techno-industrial

1315
02:09:04,680 --> 02:09:09,880
cub and indulgent civilization, this complex dissipative structure, right, that's creating

1316
02:09:09,880 --> 02:09:15,960
entropy like nobody's business. How do we, how do we navigate that with a bloated population of

1317
02:09:15,960 --> 02:09:21,720
eight billion people, half of which would not exist? I mean, A, half of which happened in my lifetime,

1318
02:09:21,720 --> 02:09:27,800
right? We went from four billion to eight billion since the 70s. And at the same time,

1319
02:09:27,800 --> 02:09:32,600
half of the people alive, every single one of those new extra people only is here because we're

1320
02:09:32,600 --> 02:09:39,400
using fossil fuels as fertilizers and pesticides. So how do we do this? This is a complex dissipated

1321
02:09:39,400 --> 02:09:44,120
structure, this energy-hungry civilization that if we stop the energy inputs collapses. If it

1322
02:09:44,120 --> 02:09:51,080
collapses, that's curtains for so many of us and so much tragedy and suffering. So how do we leapfrog

1323
02:09:52,520 --> 02:10:01,000
from this situation to a lower carbon, higher energy, higher efficiency civilization that

1324
02:10:01,000 --> 02:10:06,760
protects and preserves us? So that's Jim and Macy's question. We're the people of the passage,

1325
02:10:07,560 --> 02:10:13,720
right? What is ours to do? How do we maintain hope, right? How do we die before we die,

1326
02:10:14,760 --> 02:10:20,120
right? So that we know our lives are forfeit. I'm no longer just a self-interested little monkey

1327
02:10:20,120 --> 02:10:25,320
seeking pleasure and avoiding pain. I realize my life is my offering. My life is my gift.

1328
02:10:25,320 --> 02:10:32,040
So that's step one. Step two, go from living as a fragmented, isolated little potted plant

1329
02:10:32,760 --> 02:10:38,840
of a deconditioned zoo animal, hyper neurotic consumer individual to taking my stand in a

1330
02:10:38,840 --> 02:10:44,360
stand of community and relations. How do I live seven generationally? How do I live on behalf of

1331
02:10:44,360 --> 02:10:49,720
my great-great grandparents who clearly busted us to get me this little ember that I've now fanned

1332
02:10:49,720 --> 02:10:54,440
into a flame? Do I get to say I'm sad or mad or disappointed? They didn't give me more. No,

1333
02:10:54,440 --> 02:11:00,680
they fucking gave me the emper and I'm now basking in a bonfire like amen. And my three generations

1334
02:11:00,680 --> 02:11:05,960
ahead of me, my children, my children's children, my children's children's children, how do I live

1335
02:11:05,960 --> 02:11:11,000
as part of that seven generations? And then to your point about what does life have a purpose,

1336
02:11:11,000 --> 02:11:17,160
does it have a point? It's both, right? Life is both cyclical and endlessly creating and destroying

1337
02:11:17,160 --> 02:11:22,840
and that is senseless and amoral and horrifying to contemplate from our point of view, where we

1338
02:11:22,840 --> 02:11:29,160
care deeply about our little part of things. And it's also a creative. Every single time that

1339
02:11:29,160 --> 02:11:34,840
cycle of creation and destruction happens, it spits out complexity. It spits out these novel,

1340
02:11:34,840 --> 02:11:41,960
rare, precious moments and we can anchor to them by ritual, seeking refuge and ritual,

1341
02:11:42,680 --> 02:11:48,200
mocking the seasons, mocking our lives, mocking our rites of passage, right? Noticing one of the

1342
02:11:48,200 --> 02:11:53,400
most profound ones I've seen was just a black and white photo of a Jewish family in Amsterdam

1343
02:11:53,400 --> 02:11:59,960
in 1941 celebrating Hanukkah. And you're like, oh man, like that was darkness. That was peak,

1344
02:11:59,960 --> 02:12:05,560
peak darkness of World War II. And there they were oppressed and hunted. And they were still

1345
02:12:05,560 --> 02:12:11,160
bearing witness to their lineage's rituals. Think of the Tibetan diaspora. Think of any

1346
02:12:11,160 --> 02:12:17,320
First Nation peoples that have been relocated. Think of the Rohingya, the Uighurs, right? The Kurds,

1347
02:12:17,880 --> 02:12:22,520
you know, the Roma, like there are fourth world peoples, peoples without a homeland,

1348
02:12:23,240 --> 02:12:27,400
right? That have been able to persist by carrying their rituals. So this is what it means to be

1349
02:12:27,400 --> 02:12:32,200
the people of the passage. And if we can do those three things, right? If we can die before we die,

1350
02:12:32,200 --> 02:12:36,920
so we know what's ours to give, we can live seven generationally. So that stretches out our sense

1351
02:12:37,240 --> 02:12:43,480
of what if I don't get mine? No. Oh, it's okay. Because I'm doing something on behalf of those

1352
02:12:43,480 --> 02:12:49,720
yet to be. And we seek refuge and ritual. We anchor the insanity and the constant slipstream

1353
02:12:50,280 --> 02:12:57,400
towards entropy with observing the passages. And then finally, what does that allow us to do?

1354
02:12:57,400 --> 02:13:02,920
It allows us to leave space for grace. Because none of us know how this is going to turn out.

1355
02:13:02,920 --> 02:13:10,280
And that's Thanos's pathology, right? Thanos is right up to the point where he is 100% certain

1356
02:13:11,240 --> 02:13:16,760
of how it's all going to turn out. And therefore that justifies his murderous behavior. We can never

1357
02:13:16,760 --> 02:13:27,480
be sure. There's a great quote I heard recently, which is we control nothing. We influence everything.

1358
02:13:28,440 --> 02:13:37,160
And we have no idea, right, where those ripples will go. So by leaving space for grace, like,

1359
02:13:37,160 --> 02:13:41,640
do we know how this all turns out? No, none of us could possibly know how it all turns out. But one

1360
02:13:41,640 --> 02:13:50,200
thing is certain. If we give up hope now, then hope has no chance. If we hold on to radical hope,

1361
02:13:50,200 --> 02:13:55,160
which is a very, it's actually, it's not just an adjective or a superlative, it's an academic term

1362
02:13:55,880 --> 02:13:59,000
from Jonathan Laird at the University of Chicago, who studied 19th century Indian

1363
02:13:59,000 --> 02:14:03,400
reservations. And radical hope is a specific definition. It's having hope for a future you

1364
02:14:03,400 --> 02:14:11,240
cannot see from here, but commit to nonetheless. So leaving space for grace, right, is the

1365
02:14:11,240 --> 02:14:17,640
butterfly effect. Time soul force at the end of time for all the models.

1366
02:14:18,040 --> 02:14:26,840
That's brilliant. And I'd like to read a quote to you from my favorite movie, Lord of the Rings,

1367
02:14:26,840 --> 02:14:32,040
that I think it just kept coming up in this conversation. And especially now,

1368
02:14:32,680 --> 02:14:35,640
we're at the end of two towers. You've seen Lord of the Rings, right?

1369
02:14:36,600 --> 02:14:41,800
Oh, dude, I did my senior thesis in high school on Lord of the Rings. I've been way in the pudding.

1370
02:14:41,800 --> 02:14:46,600
We ran a camp called Rivendell long before the movies came out. Oh, my God, that sounds amazing.

1371
02:14:46,600 --> 02:14:53,560
So at the end of two towers, when all hope seemed to be lost, Sam says to Frodo, it's all wrong

1372
02:14:53,560 --> 02:14:58,760
by rights. We shouldn't even be here. But we are. It's like in the great stories, Mr. Frodo,

1373
02:14:58,760 --> 02:15:03,720
the ones that really mattered, full of darkness and danger they were. And sometimes you didn't

1374
02:15:03,720 --> 02:15:08,440
even want to know the end, because how could the end be happy? How could the world go back to

1375
02:15:08,440 --> 02:15:13,800
the way it was before so much bad happened? But in the end, it is only a passing thing,

1376
02:15:13,800 --> 02:15:19,960
this shadow. Even darkness must pass. A new day will come. And when the sun shines, it will

1377
02:15:19,960 --> 02:15:24,760
shine out the clearer. Those were the stories that stayed with you, that meant something.

1378
02:15:25,480 --> 02:15:32,040
Even if you were too small to understand why. But I think, Mr. Frodo, I do understand. I know now.

1379
02:15:32,920 --> 02:15:36,680
Folk in those stories had lots of chances of turning back, only they didn't,

1380
02:15:36,680 --> 02:15:39,560
because they were holding on to something. And then Frodo says,

1381
02:15:40,360 --> 02:15:45,160
what were they holding on to, Sam? And he says that there's something good in this world,

1382
02:15:45,160 --> 02:15:51,800
Mr. Frodo, and it's worth fighting for. And so like, when you told me about the family

1383
02:15:51,800 --> 02:15:56,920
celebrating Hanukkah in 1941, in the midst of World War II, they're being hunted.

1384
02:15:57,960 --> 02:16:04,440
You know, it's like in the darkest night, they held on to that little flame, and that got them

1385
02:16:04,440 --> 02:16:10,120
through the deep dark. You know, you got to hold on to something. You got to find some

1386
02:16:10,120 --> 02:16:16,360
little shred of good in this world, and hold on to it, and that'll get you through anything. And

1387
02:16:18,440 --> 02:16:21,720
you know, it's like the night is the coldest just before dawn.

1388
02:16:23,080 --> 02:16:26,680
Which if you spend any time in the mountains, is you know, like you're literally waiting for

1389
02:16:26,680 --> 02:16:33,160
the sun to come up to get some sleep. Yeah, yeah, so no matter how bad things seem,

1390
02:16:34,040 --> 02:16:37,240
it'll pass. And you just got to hold on to what is good.

1391
02:16:38,920 --> 02:16:45,160
Well, you know, to riff on the Tolkien stuff, that notion of leaving space for grace, because

1392
02:16:45,160 --> 02:16:51,320
like we don't know how it's going to turn out, isn't simply the kind of Hollywood version of a

1393
02:16:51,320 --> 02:16:55,400
story of like, oh, it's climactic, and we don't know. And then finally Rocky comes back with the

1394
02:16:55,400 --> 02:17:00,760
final punch and wins the belt, you know, like that kind of a thing. Because if you think about,

1395
02:17:00,760 --> 02:17:07,000
I mean, I think it's so brilliant how Tolkien did this, right? Because how does, against all

1396
02:17:07,000 --> 02:17:15,080
overwhelming odds of Mordor and darkness, how does light prevail? Right? Light prevails in Lord

1397
02:17:15,080 --> 02:17:24,280
of the Rings through the perverse actions of Golan. And, and somewhere earlier, I think Sam,

1398
02:17:24,280 --> 02:17:28,760
you know, Sam hates Golan, right? And he's in that constant back and forth with Frodo.

1399
02:17:29,480 --> 02:17:35,800
And Sam wants to kill him. And Gandalf intervenes. And he says he may yet have a part to play.

1400
02:17:35,800 --> 02:17:39,160
Oh, Frodo wants to kill him. Oh, does he? Okay.

1401
02:17:39,160 --> 02:17:42,680
In the beginning. Yeah. In the first one, Frodo wants to kill him. And Gandalf says that.

1402
02:17:42,680 --> 02:17:48,360
Yes. Okay. Thank you. So first, so yes, the Hobbits want to kill Golan, who's Smeagol,

1403
02:17:48,360 --> 02:17:52,280
who is arguably, I mean, you know, I think there's a new film now coming out is going to pack a

1404
02:17:52,280 --> 02:17:56,120
bunch of this, but like, right. I mean, he was a Hobbit like device before he gets completely

1405
02:17:56,120 --> 02:18:00,360
warped by the ring. So it's in some respect, it's the Hobbit's shadow self, right? And they want to

1406
02:18:00,360 --> 02:18:08,760
kill him. Gandalf says, hey, wait, he may still. So the, the, the simplistic version of that would

1407
02:18:08,760 --> 02:18:15,480
be, oh, we show him love and compassion. And then Smeagol triumphs over Golan, right? And we now

1408
02:18:15,480 --> 02:18:19,720
integrate him into the light and he's on team good guy and he does something good for us. No,

1409
02:18:19,800 --> 02:18:26,360
that's not what happens, right? In the crux, not even Frodo stays true to his higher nature. The

1410
02:18:26,360 --> 02:18:36,360
ring bends everyone. Smeagol collapses entirely into his Golan self. And they are struggling

1411
02:18:36,360 --> 02:18:44,360
shadow to shadow and that somehow with the biting off of Frodo's finger, right? And Golan falling

1412
02:18:44,360 --> 02:18:53,320
into Mount Doom, that's what saves it. And that kind of impossible ambiguity, right, still delivering

1413
02:18:53,880 --> 02:19:00,360
redemption to me is one of the best lessons for us because it's not a happily ever after

1414
02:19:00,360 --> 02:19:07,080
simplistic heroic arc. It's not where good is rewarded with good and bad and evil is punished.

1415
02:19:07,080 --> 02:19:14,200
It's a wildly ironic ending, right? But the leaving space for grace, which is what Gandalf

1416
02:19:14,200 --> 02:19:20,600
was taking a stand for back before he possibly had any idea what that might mean, right? It's

1417
02:19:20,600 --> 02:19:28,200
the commitment to that that then saves Middle Earth. And that I think is one of the most

1418
02:19:29,320 --> 02:19:33,960
powerful lessons for all of us because again, from time to time, we're going to be facing or

1419
02:19:33,960 --> 02:19:39,560
not even from time to time, probably increasingly, we will be facing a litany of news that simply

1420
02:19:39,560 --> 02:19:46,600
doesn't pencil out. And the kind of whistling past the graveyard hope, you know, is simply going to

1421
02:19:46,600 --> 02:19:56,280
be inadequate. So we have to be able to anchor to something deeper and more enduring. And I think

1422
02:19:56,280 --> 02:20:03,400
Gandalf's lesson is a beautiful one for all of us. Absolutely. Well, on that note, I think this

1423
02:20:03,400 --> 02:20:08,920
podcast has gone amazing right from the beginning. You were just on fire. I like the podcast where

1424
02:20:09,000 --> 02:20:17,880
I don't have to talk much. For me, if I talk like less than 1%, that's great. But this was amazing.

1425
02:20:17,880 --> 02:20:24,120
And I'm sure there's going to be lots of great clips to extract from this. And thanks for taking

1426
02:20:24,120 --> 02:20:30,040
the time. Dude, I mean, I'm happy to, you know, just continue this conversation, you know,

1427
02:20:30,040 --> 02:20:36,280
on and off screen, however it makes sense. But I think there's tons of overlap in the things you're

1428
02:20:36,280 --> 02:20:41,160
curious about and care about and the stuff that, you know, the trees we're barking at as well. So

1429
02:20:42,200 --> 02:20:48,600
so much overlap. It's kind of shocking, like all the names you were saying are people that I've been

1430
02:20:48,600 --> 02:20:52,920
curious about. And the books you were mentioning were ones that I like, I feel like if we were two

1431
02:20:52,920 --> 02:20:57,400
planets, we're like, our orbits are kind of like getting pretty close to each other.

1432
02:20:58,920 --> 02:21:03,000
Totally. Yeah. Totally totally. All right, Mike. Awesome. Thanks for the time.
