1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
People who haven't spent a lot of time in deep wilderness

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
mostly don't know how much happier they would be if they were.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Mostly don't know how many of their pains and illnesses and psychological disorders would go away,

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:21,000
how much of the striving is actually a result of emptiness from living in an environment

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
in which we don't have intimate relationships with other people in nature.

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:32,000
If you spend time with an indigenous culture and see how much more they understand the language of all the animals,

7
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:37,000
most people aren't aware of how impoverished their life is that they don't know how to communicate to the animals,

8
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
that they don't know what the whole world around them is saying all the time,

9
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
and that their mind is never still and quiet.

10
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:49,000
So it's hard to feel bad about missing something you've never experienced and you don't know exists.

11
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Also, when the addict is coming down, they don't want happiness.

12
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
They want a hit of the supply, right?

13
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
If somebody's coming down on heroin, they don't want to see a beautiful sunset.

14
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
They don't want a deep conversation with a friend.

15
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Everything else is meaningless because they have created a hypernormal stimuli

16
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
that allows them to only get happiness from a very narrow thing.

17
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
It's actually dead in their ability to get happiness from lots of things.

18
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
So there are reward circuits in us that are more addictive.

19
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:27,000
There are other reward circuits that are not addictive that are more actually...

20
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:32,000
So the addictive reward circuit will give you a very quick spike and then it will drop you,

21
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
and then that makes a craving for another spike.

22
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:38,000
And obviously sugar does this and likes on social media do this

23
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,000
and using filters to look more beautiful than you are does this and etc.

24
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Most of the things in our world do some version of this

25
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,000
and then in the low, then you crave more of that thing.

26
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:54,000
And so you get, of course, more bipolar type experience,

27
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
but you also get an erosion of your baseline over time.

28
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
There's less and less things that make you happy.

29
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,000
You more and more need those stimulus and you need larger amounts of them.

30
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:11,000
The types of reward circuits that lead to psychologically, physiologically, healthy people

31
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:16,000
are ones that don't give you as much spike as quickly, but raise your baseline over time.

32
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,000
And so the type of reward you get from exercising,

33
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:23,000
the type of reward you get from meaningful conversation with friends,

34
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:27,000
from helping somebody, from time in nature, you get reward circuits from those things,

35
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:31,000
but they're different in kind than the reward circuits you get from fast food

36
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:35,000
or from porn or from social media or those other things.

37
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,000
But it's very hard to monetize those things on the supply side.

38
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:42,000
It's very hard to sell you any of the things that on your deathbed

39
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:46,000
you will say are what you wish you had spent all of your time with.

40
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Every person on their deathbed says,

41
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,000
I wish I had spent more time with my family and with my kids

42
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,000
and with the people that I loved and telling them that I loved them

43
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,000
and working less and pursuing things less.

44
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:01,000
And none of the hits that they were spending their life pursuing

45
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,000
are at all meaningful in those reflections.

46
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:09,000
But because the supply side can basically market to the addictive impulse better

47
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,000
and it's important to understand that like from a business perspective,

48
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:16,000
especially once you have a fiduciary responsibility to maximize shareholder profit,

49
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,000
you're like legally bound to that as a director of public corporation.

50
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:25,000
One of the core goals is maximize the lifetime revenue of a customer.

51
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:29,000
And addiction is awesome for a lifetime revenue of a customer.

52
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:34,000
So when you look at the emergence of fast food and processed foods,

53
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:39,000
whether we're talking about hostesses and Twinkies or Candies or Coke or McDonald's,

54
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:44,000
they're basically combinations of salt, fat and sugar,

55
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:48,000
different combinations of that with different texture profiles

56
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:52,000
that were actually scientifically optimized to maximize addiction.

57
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:57,000
There were lots of split tests done to see which ones had the people crave them the most again.

58
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Yet the reason that people, in an evolutionary environment,

59
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:05,000
the reason that things that had salt and fat and sugar

60
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:09,000
gave people more of a kind of dopamine hit was because in an evolutionary environment,

61
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,000
pre-agriculture, those things were very rare.

62
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
It was hard to get much of them.

63
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:18,000
And so if you got them, there was an incentive to go find the things

64
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
that were evolutionarily rare and that were useful.

65
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,000
As soon as we make them hyperabundance, then people are dying of the excess of them,

66
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,000
we've built a world we're not actually genetically fit to,

67
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:31,000
and then exploit the weakness of that rather than try to support people to navigate it well.

68
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:36,000
But it's also that those nutrients were bound with vitamins and minerals

69
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
and a lot of other nutrients simultaneously.

70
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:42,000
So the fast food removes all the micronutrients,

71
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,000
optimizes those things, optimizes addiction,

72
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:50,000
and so you can have people who are actually dying of malnutrition while they're obese

73
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:54,000
because they're so deficient in micronutrients.

74
00:04:54,000 --> 00:05:00,000
And so what fast food is to food where you just take the maximally addictive part

75
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:05,000
and strip out why we're even attracted to it in an evolutionary environment,

76
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
strip out all of what's good in it,

77
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:11,000
is also what social media relationships are to human relationships,

78
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:16,000
is also what porn is to human intimacy,

79
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:23,000
is also what the news is to the desire to understand the world you live in,

80
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:28,000
is what productivity is relative to meaning.

81
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Stripping out a very narrow, aligned with the interest of the market hit

82
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
that still has that same thing,

83
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,000
then you will feel a need for greater and greater productivity

84
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:43,000
and of course that is great from a GDP maximizing perspective

85
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
and not great from a deathbed reflections

86
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:49,000
or the quality of how children are raised

87
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
or the quality of the environment perspective.
