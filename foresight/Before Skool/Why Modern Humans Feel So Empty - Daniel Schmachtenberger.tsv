0	4000	People who haven't spent a lot of time in deep wilderness
4000	8000	mostly don't know how much happier they would be if they were.
8000	14000	Mostly don't know how many of their pains and illnesses and psychological disorders would go away,
14000	21000	how much of the striving is actually a result of emptiness from living in an environment
21000	24000	in which we don't have intimate relationships with other people in nature.
24000	32000	If you spend time with an indigenous culture and see how much more they understand the language of all the animals,
32000	37000	most people aren't aware of how impoverished their life is that they don't know how to communicate to the animals,
37000	40000	that they don't know what the whole world around them is saying all the time,
40000	44000	and that their mind is never still and quiet.
44000	49000	So it's hard to feel bad about missing something you've never experienced and you don't know exists.
50000	57000	Also, when the addict is coming down, they don't want happiness.
57000	60000	They want a hit of the supply, right?
60000	64000	If somebody's coming down on heroin, they don't want to see a beautiful sunset.
64000	67000	They don't want a deep conversation with a friend.
67000	73000	Everything else is meaningless because they have created a hypernormal stimuli
73000	76000	that allows them to only get happiness from a very narrow thing.
76000	79000	It's actually dead in their ability to get happiness from lots of things.
79000	82000	So there are reward circuits in us that are more addictive.
82000	87000	There are other reward circuits that are not addictive that are more actually...
87000	92000	So the addictive reward circuit will give you a very quick spike and then it will drop you,
92000	94000	and then that makes a craving for another spike.
94000	98000	And obviously sugar does this and likes on social media do this
98000	102000	and using filters to look more beautiful than you are does this and etc.
102000	106000	Most of the things in our world do some version of this
106000	109000	and then in the low, then you crave more of that thing.
109000	114000	And so you get, of course, more bipolar type experience,
114000	117000	but you also get an erosion of your baseline over time.
117000	120000	There's less and less things that make you happy.
120000	124000	You more and more need those stimulus and you need larger amounts of them.
124000	131000	The types of reward circuits that lead to psychologically, physiologically, healthy people
131000	136000	are ones that don't give you as much spike as quickly, but raise your baseline over time.
136000	139000	And so the type of reward you get from exercising,
139000	143000	the type of reward you get from meaningful conversation with friends,
143000	147000	from helping somebody, from time in nature, you get reward circuits from those things,
147000	151000	but they're different in kind than the reward circuits you get from fast food
151000	155000	or from porn or from social media or those other things.
155000	158000	But it's very hard to monetize those things on the supply side.
158000	162000	It's very hard to sell you any of the things that on your deathbed
162000	166000	you will say are what you wish you had spent all of your time with.
166000	168000	Every person on their deathbed says,
168000	171000	I wish I had spent more time with my family and with my kids
171000	174000	and with the people that I loved and telling them that I loved them
174000	177000	and working less and pursuing things less.
177000	181000	And none of the hits that they were spending their life pursuing
181000	184000	are at all meaningful in those reflections.
184000	189000	But because the supply side can basically market to the addictive impulse better
189000	192000	and it's important to understand that like from a business perspective,
192000	196000	especially once you have a fiduciary responsibility to maximize shareholder profit,
196000	200000	you're like legally bound to that as a director of public corporation.
200000	205000	One of the core goals is maximize the lifetime revenue of a customer.
205000	209000	And addiction is awesome for a lifetime revenue of a customer.
209000	214000	So when you look at the emergence of fast food and processed foods,
214000	219000	whether we're talking about hostesses and Twinkies or Candies or Coke or McDonald's,
219000	224000	they're basically combinations of salt, fat and sugar,
224000	228000	different combinations of that with different texture profiles
228000	232000	that were actually scientifically optimized to maximize addiction.
232000	237000	There were lots of split tests done to see which ones had the people crave them the most again.
237000	241000	Yet the reason that people, in an evolutionary environment,
241000	245000	the reason that things that had salt and fat and sugar
245000	249000	gave people more of a kind of dopamine hit was because in an evolutionary environment,
249000	252000	pre-agriculture, those things were very rare.
252000	254000	It was hard to get much of them.
254000	258000	And so if you got them, there was an incentive to go find the things
258000	260000	that were evolutionarily rare and that were useful.
260000	263000	As soon as we make them hyperabundance, then people are dying of the excess of them,
263000	266000	we've built a world we're not actually genetically fit to,
266000	271000	and then exploit the weakness of that rather than try to support people to navigate it well.
271000	276000	But it's also that those nutrients were bound with vitamins and minerals
276000	278000	and a lot of other nutrients simultaneously.
278000	282000	So the fast food removes all the micronutrients,
282000	285000	optimizes those things, optimizes addiction,
285000	290000	and so you can have people who are actually dying of malnutrition while they're obese
290000	294000	because they're so deficient in micronutrients.
294000	300000	And so what fast food is to food where you just take the maximally addictive part
300000	305000	and strip out why we're even attracted to it in an evolutionary environment,
305000	307000	strip out all of what's good in it,
307000	311000	is also what social media relationships are to human relationships,
311000	316000	is also what porn is to human intimacy,
316000	323000	is also what the news is to the desire to understand the world you live in,
323000	328000	is what productivity is relative to meaning.
328000	334000	Stripping out a very narrow, aligned with the interest of the market hit
334000	336000	that still has that same thing,
336000	339000	then you will feel a need for greater and greater productivity
339000	343000	and of course that is great from a GDP maximizing perspective
343000	345000	and not great from a deathbed reflections
345000	349000	or the quality of how children are raised
349000	351000	or the quality of the environment perspective.
