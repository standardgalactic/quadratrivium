0	7000	It is great to see you again.
7000	10000	Great to see you, Mark. Thanks for having me on.
10000	16000	Yeah, I really admire you because you always stand up for the truth and what you believe in,
16000	21000	and even when it's not popular, and even when the risks are very high.
21000	28000	And I really admire that about you, and I'm wondering, has it been worth it?
28000	30000	Standing up for the truth?
30000	31000	Yes.
31000	34000	Yes, unquestionably.
34000	43000	Now, that's relatively easy for me to say in the current circumstance because as much as standing up for the truth has been very costly,
43000	57000	it has also opened up many doors, and so for me, the opportunities that exist at the forefront of this battle are good ones.
57000	62000	And I feel very positive about my role in the world at the moment.
62000	69000	And that said, there is no guarantee that when you do stand up that you will end up in such a circumstance.
69000	81000	And I think about people who have paid an extremely high price, and in fact, I was just looking in the last couple of days at the story of a young woman
81000	88000	who fought the Nazis courageously, did a tremendous amount of good fighting for the resistance,
88000	96000	and ultimately was caught, imprisoned, tortured, and in the end hanged.
96000	105000	Given one final opportunity to cough up the information that she had on her compatriots, she refused to do it and died as a result.
105000	111000	And so the question is, if you find yourself in that circumstance, do you still feel that it was the right thing to do?
111000	114000	And none of us can really say for sure how we would react.
114000	123000	And my hope is that even in that circumstance, I would still feel that standing up for what was right was the only choice,
123000	127000	and that it is true that there are prices to be paid for these things,
127000	135000	but history depends on somebody being willing to face those things, and I'm honored to be in that group.
135000	139000	If you could go back in time, would you have done anything differently?
139000	147000	That is a tough question to answer for what I would argue is a technical reason.
147000	156000	Obviously, if you could go back in time and alter something, there are lots of places where you wish you had said something different,
156000	161000	or you wish you had known something earlier or had noticed something that should have caught your attention,
161000	166000	and if you could change that without changing anything else, of course, you'd be a fool not to.
166000	170000	The problem is in changing any of those things, you risk everything that came later,
170000	178000	and given those stakes, you know, I'm a guy with family that I love,
178000	186000	and I would not risk the possibility that had I made some better decision on some topic that it might have a catastrophic impact,
186000	188000	even just indirectly.
188000	191000	So, at a technical level, no.
191000	200000	But if I could go back and change certain things all a cart and be guaranteed that nothing disconnected was altered,
200000	207000	yeah, there are lots of things I wish I had done differently, not major things, I think.
207000	213000	Overall, the application of First Principles toolkit,
213000	217000	a desire to follow the evidence where it leads,
217000	230000	and a willingness to consider any hypothesis has been an excellent approach in very confusing, noisy times.
230000	235000	I've heard you mention First Principles a number of times,
235000	239000	and I kind of don't know what First Principles are.
239000	244000	If you could, could you explain what First Principle thinking is?
244000	252000	I can try. You know, it's one of these terms that one knows it when you see it,
252000	259000	but as for having a formal definition, I don't have one, but I can tell you how it works.
259000	268000	There are levels of analysis for any observable pattern.
268000	275000	You could go to a baseball game, and you could think of it in terms of, let's say, atoms.
275000	279000	Now, it's true that everything in baseball is made of atoms,
279000	287000	from the flesh of the players themselves to the neurological content of their nervous systems.
287000	294000	It's all atoms. The ball is a cluster of atoms attracted together for chemical reasons.
294000	302000	When the bat touches it, it conveys momentum from atoms in the bat to atoms in the ball.
302000	307000	You could analyze it that way, but it's not a very productive way to do so.
307000	313000	So we don't. We analyze it at the level of the players, their strengths and weaknesses.
313000	321000	We think of the ball and the bat as unitary items that interact in a known way.
322000	329000	So one thing to say is that first principles is not an obligation always to go to the very lowest level,
329000	334000	because very often you'd get nothing extra and you would make any question intractable by doing so.
334000	349000	But what it is, is a bias towards explaining phenomena that we observe from the simplest set of contributing factors
349000	353000	that actually accomplishes the goal in a compelling way.
353000	362000	So when we talk about, let's say, war between populations,
362000	370000	first principles thinking tells us that war, that nations are composed of people,
370000	376000	that people are apes that have evolved unique characteristics,
376000	383000	they've evolved technological capability, that warfare is something that is not unique to our species,
383000	392000	but is almost unique, that when populations find themselves in battle,
392000	401000	it is generally over resources that often the way in which the reasons for being in battle are described,
401000	405000	obscure the resources in question, etc.
405000	413000	So if you take those axioms and you apply them to the analysis of a given conflict,
413000	420000	you often understand more about why that given conflict unfolds the way that it does than you would
420000	431000	if you stood too close and analyzed the particular details of the individual personalities involved in marching toward, etc.
431000	444000	So first principles is a bias towards explaining things with a smaller number of robust assumptions
444000	451000	rather than from the particular details of the situation in question.
451000	457000	So somebody that was using first principles would look at a tree, for instance,
457000	463000	and not just see the apple on the tree, they would know that the tree has roots
463000	470000	and the roots require a certain type of soil and they can map that style of thinking onto every tree.
470000	481000	Yes, I suppose the tree is a creature like any other.
481000	493000	Its objective is the same as all other creatures and that is to lodge its genes as deeply into the future as it can.
493000	497000	Its ability to access the future is very limited.
497000	503000	Its mechanism for doing so involves capturing energy from the sun,
503000	519000	trapping it in chemical bonds that allow it to be released later for particular purposes to which the tree is directed and has the machinery capable.
519000	524000	All of this makes first principles thinking sound preposterous because in general,
524000	529000	when one who has gone through all of this logic looks at a tree, none of it comes up.
529000	536000	But when extrapolating about why the tree has an apple, it is necessary.
536000	539000	Suppose you didn't know the answer to that question, why do trees produce apples?
539000	541000	Or why do apple trees produce apples?
541000	550000	And you took the apple off the tree and it smelled good to you and you put a piece of it in your mouth and you discover actually it's not toxic,
550000	558000	you can eat it and actually it can sustain you.
558000	565000	Why is the tree burdening itself by producing a food that it does not eat?
565000	573000	Well, we know the answer to that question is that that food is an enticement for other creatures that don't have enough to eat
573000	586000	and that by wrapping its seeds in this food that those creatures can be induced to distribute the seed in a way that a tree cannot do itself.
586000	592000	Then we can talk about why it is that a tree might want to distribute its seeds rather than just drop them below its branches
592000	605000	and that has to do with competition, it has to do with establishing populations of trees in places that are ecologically hospitable to them
605000	611000	but that don't have a population of those trees yet and all of these are a means to an evolutionary objective.
612000	630000	I guess in rethinking about your question, first principles thinking is an obligation to use general principles rather than specifics to explain any given observation.
630000	638000	There's a lot of things that apply to any tree, there's certain things that apply only to apple trees and then there will be other things that apply to this particular apple tree
638000	650000	and if we're talking about this particular apple tree, it is the wrong level of analysis to use the general facts of evolution or the general shared characteristics of all trees
650000	658000	but more often than not there is a set of general principles that explains the phenomenon you are looking at
658000	669000	and it is far more clarifying to look at those principles rather than the specific details which are often the ones right in front of your eyes.
669000	680000	So a non first principle thinker would kind of just see surface level facts and would not see the deeper connectivity between things
680000	690000	where a first principle thinker kind of goes much deeper, they can go deeper, they can zoom in, they can zoom out, they can see things on many different levels.
690000	702000	Yes, and I think there is overall a bias towards the elegance of one's map of the universe.
702000	710000	To the extent that you invest in understanding the general principles that account for most patterns, you don't have to redo it.
710000	715000	It may be hard to understand them at first but once you've understood them you can see that they apply again and again.
715000	722000	If you invest in the particular details of the individual in front of you then that doesn't necessarily apply anywhere else
722000	726000	and in fact it may mislead you about the next example that looks somewhat similar.
726000	733000	So that doesn't mean that a first principles thinker has the entire map at their disposal, none of us do.
733000	740000	But a first principles thinker recognizes where their first principles do not account for the thing they want to understand
740000	752000	and they know where they need to invest next in order to flesh out the map so that it can actually encompass all of the phenomena they are interested in understanding.
753000	758000	Well, I've been really impressed by you because you've made some really bold predictions.
758000	766000	Ever since I first discovered you, you've been really good at predicting what's going to happen with these big things like the future of college.
766000	772000	I've heard you talk a lot about that and maybe I heard you talk about it five years ago for the first time
772000	776000	and it seems like kind of that wokeness has taken over.
776000	786000	You've been right about, to me, the jab about the lab leak and does this come from your ability to use first principles
786000	793000	so you can see patterns instead of just like, oh, here's the fact that I've been given.
793000	799000	I would say it comes from two places. One of them I think you've identified correctly.
799000	807000	First principles thinking is a skill. It's not something any of us are good at until we practice it.
807000	816000	I wouldn't say none of us are born with it because I think we are actually all born with a toolkit that can easily be built out
816000	821000	and that for most of us, maybe even for all of us, that it would be valuable if it were.
821000	828000	But the experiences we have developmentally don't reward this kind of thinking and in fact sometimes they punish it.
828000	838000	So it's hard to develop that toolkit because you have to be resistant to the forces that want to push you in a different direction
838000	842000	and that speaks to the other important component.
842000	855000	Human beings are fundamentally social creatures on which one's well-being depends heavily on what other individuals think of you
855000	867000	and what that means is that humans are very sensitive to the evidence that those around them are disturbed by something that they themselves have said.
867000	875000	If you are sensitive to that, then it's very easy to drive you off a path of inquiry.
875000	886000	In fact, I would argue that historically, because all creatures exist in a perpetual state of not having enough,
886000	892000	there may be seasons in which you have plenty but they precede seasons in which there isn't enough
892000	901000	and that's almost an automatic rule of nature because if you exist in a population that has too much, the population will grow until that's not true anymore.
901000	910000	So any stable population has a resource limitation problem which means that every creature is not far from starvation
910000	920000	and possesses programs that are built to prevent starvation from happening and to address it when it does.
920000	935000	When a human being hears that those around them are displeased, they naturally react as if they are stepping onto a slippery slope that results in starvation
935000	938000	and so they tend to back off.
938000	945000	That's because in the past if you had been driven out of your group because what you were saying was out of phase with what other people believed,
945000	955000	it didn't matter whether you were right or wrong because you weren't going to make it to the next important evolutionary event.
955000	967000	In order to do careful thinking, you have to shut down that circuit that does not want to be out of step with one's peers.
967000	983000	It is absolutely vital because we know from the history of modern thought that all of the great ideas started with people who were out of phase
983000	988000	and who in spite of that fact kept forging ahead.
988000	996000	So yes, you can protect yourself to a limited extent by making sure you're never outside the Overton window
996000	1004000	but if you actually want to advance the ball for civilization, if you want to discover things that nobody knows, things that are important,
1004000	1012000	things that open up innovations that can be useful, you have to be ready to be completely alone in some belief.
1012000	1022000	And I am fortunate to have had the developmental experience that tells me just because I'm the only person who believes something doesn't make it wrong
1022000	1025000	and doesn't mean I should change course.
1025000	1036000	I wish every aspiring intellectual could have that experience because we would have a much freer, more productive discussion
1036000	1042000	and we would discover more, we would do so much more rapidly if people were emboldened.
1042000	1047000	It doesn't mean that just because you're out of phase, you're right. In fact, you're probably wrong.
1047000	1052000	Just because you're out of phase doesn't give you information one way or the other
1052000	1062000	and society depends on people who happen to be on the fringe of thought who are correct sticking to their guns and going forward.
1062000	1070000	Do you think that's the reason why certain ideologies have been able to just sweep through our institutions?
1070000	1076000	It is the reason that they have swept our institutions. It's a simple matter of game theory.
1076000	1083000	People can be asked whether they agree with a premise that they full well know is false.
1083000	1091000	But if the stakes are, if you say you disagree or if you ask questions or if you show any evidence that you're not on board with that belief,
1091000	1094000	then you will be specifically targeted.
1094000	1100000	Whereas if you indicate that you agree with the belief they will move on to targeting somebody else,
1100000	1110000	the cost-benefit analysis of standing up for reality, at least in the immediate case, does not suggest that you should say what you know.
1110000	1115000	It suggests that you should say what you know is false.
1115000	1118000	And the problem, there are actually several problems.
1118000	1124000	One, that is the recipe for contagious fictions to sweep these institutions.
1124000	1137000	But two, because that's such an uncomfortable process, people do not like being induced through fear and intimidation to lie about what they know.
1137000	1141000	In an order not to be caught in that bind, they will actually lie to themselves.
1141000	1150000	They will take on the beliefs that they knew the minute before were false in order that when they say it, it's actually in some sense genuine.
1150000	1154000	It's not just that the cynical game theory has taken over the institutions.
1154000	1161000	It's literally taken over the minds of the people who staff those institutions, so it becomes very hard to root out.
1161000	1176000	Yeah, there is a kind of a conundrum where some of the smartest intellectual people that I know are the most susceptible to getting taken over by this mind virus, it seems,
1176000	1181000	because they're better at rationalizing to themselves.
1181000	1187000	They're better at doing the mental gymnastics to make something that is not true.
1187000	1191000	They can rationalize to get to that and make it true.
1191000	1201000	If they're trying to get from point A to point B, a smart person can figure out how to get to point B, no matter how many things they have to ignore to get there.
1202000	1211000	Well, unfortunately, intelligence is in no way incompatible with cowardice.
1211000	1226000	And unfortunately, the path that takes highly intelligent people and tracks them into the academy often reinforces their cowardice and their ability, therefore, to be manipulated through fear.
1226000	1243000	One of the things that Heather and I saw very clearly at Evergreen when the college melted down around us was that all sorts of people who absolutely knew that the accusations which were being leveled against us were false didn't stand up and say so.
1243000	1254000	Some of them privately took us aside and they talked about how horrible it was, but very few stood up and publicly said, actually, these accusations are wrong.
1254000	1257000	In fact, really just one faculty colleague did.
1257000	1265000	Whereas it's interesting, among our students, many stood up and none of them switched sides.
1265000	1271000	The students who actually knew us were more likely to stand up than the faculty by far.
1271000	1284000	And I take that to be an indicator that whatever path it is that turns you into an academic is either selecting for or inducing the growth of cowardice.
1284000	1294000	And that's a dangerous situation because if there's one place that you need courageous people to stand up and say, that's simply not true, it is the academy.
1295000	1301000	Well, it seems like our universities are starting to take the dive.
1301000	1311000	When I was coming up, we both went to UC Santa Cruz different times, but I remember it was just a given that after high school, you go to college.
1311000	1313000	And that's just what you do.
1313000	1317000	If you want to make more money, if you want to have a good career, you go to college.
1317000	1323000	But now it's like people are figuring out that this is an investment and is it worth it?
1323000	1325000	That's become the big question.
1325000	1336000	And I saw a statistic that two million less undergraduate students are enrolling in university now than before the pandemic in 2019.
1336000	1341000	So it seems like people are starting to check out at the universities.
1341000	1345000	I wanted to ask you, can the universities reverse course?
1345000	1353000	Is it possible or does it need to be completely collapsed to the ground and then we rebuild something new?
1353000	1359000	In my opinion, it is simply too late for the universities.
1359000	1376000	And the reason that I say that with some confidence is that having been inside the universities, I can tell you that even if they committed themselves to an enlightenment course from this point forward,
1376000	1392000	if they fixed every broken incentive, there would be no way for them to function because the people who are on the faculty of these institutions don't remember how to do the job.
1392000	1405000	They've gotten so used to doing something that looks like science but actually is really targeted at generating grants that if asked to do proper science, they would be feeble at it.
1405000	1417000	They're not good at teaching because really what they have been doing is inducting students into a social club, the social club of college graduates.
1417000	1426000	And while you say that it used to be obvious that you should go but now the cost benefit analysis doesn't necessarily support that,
1426000	1438000	I don't think the cost benefit analysis has supported it for quite some time except at the level that your employer might require the degree in order to hire you,
1438000	1451000	which allowed the universities to become a racket you effectively had to pay their extremely high tuition tax in order to get into the job market you wanted to get into.
1451000	1458000	But the idea that people have been getting smarter in college has been questionable for decades.
1458000	1464000	I have an idea that might fix a lot but I kind of agree with what you're saying.
1464000	1474000	It's definitely too far gone but I think the guaranteed money by the government or the fact that you can't file for bankruptcy on the loans,
1474000	1484000	that incentivizes the college to, that de-incentivizes them to want to give you a degree that is worth something in the real world.
1484000	1488000	They can just make up all these majors and they don't really care.
1488000	1492000	Once you walk out their door, you're not their problem, they've got their money.
1492000	1503000	But I've seen the structure of certain code academies where it's basically free but when you walk out the door, we get a certain percentage of your salary
1503000	1510000	and if you don't get a job, if we don't teach you right, you're not going to have a salary and we're going to fail.
1510000	1519000	So perhaps if you get rid of that whole system of the loans and the guaranteed money and the no ability to file for bankruptcy,
1519000	1526000	perhaps people will start to see it more as an investment and really say, okay, is this worth it or is it not?
1526000	1527000	I don't know.
1527000	1530000	No, you're absolutely correct.
1530000	1544000	The game theory of the market surrounding higher education has put students in the driver's seat in a very unfortunate way.
1544000	1552000	It has caused the institutions to cater to what students want to hear rather than what they need to know
1552000	1561000	and that has resulted in the production of numerous fields that don't study anything that's actually real
1561000	1569000	that reinforce the pre-existing biases of students and then grant a degree for which the students have effectively paid tens of thousands,
1569000	1572000	maybe hundreds of thousands of dollars in some cases.
1572000	1582000	So that could well be fixed if the institution itself had an incentive to produce highly capable students who were highly desirable
1582000	1589000	as employees or as founders, that would align those incentives.
1589000	1595000	But it doesn't fully fix the system because that's not the only kind of corruption that has overtaken them.
1595000	1605000	We also have the corruption that comes from the fueling of these institutions with federal money through grants.
1605000	1613000	And most members of the public have no idea of what that system is and what effect it has,
1613000	1621000	but the fact that universities get 50% or more of the grant money coming in
1621000	1631000	and that this is a huge fraction of the budget of these nominally private institutions in many cases
1631000	1643000	cannot help but persuade those institutions to promote research that is expensive over research that is elegant,
1643000	1650000	to hire people who are successful at manipulating other people into believing that what they are doing is productive.
1650000	1665000	And it has resulted in the destruction of insight in fields where high quality thinking used to be the stock and trade.
1665000	1676000	Well, it is sad because our colleges were at one point, the entire world looked at our college system as like this is where you want to be.
1676000	1679000	And now it's like this indoctrination factory.
1679000	1685000	It's almost a negative at this point when somebody has a college degree on their application.
1685000	1695000	To me, when I've looked to hire people, I prefer to hire somebody that doesn't have a college degree at this point.
1695000	1700000	But I wanted to switch gears here.
1700000	1703000	Since you've been so good at predicting things,
1703000	1708000	I'm really curious to hear your prediction on the future of AI.
1708000	1719000	Now, there's been a long time idea in sci-fi movies that AI is going to become this like super being that we're going to have to go to war with.
1719000	1728000	I'm just curious to know what your prediction for this AI, what are we looking at?
1728000	1743000	I'm predicting disaster, but I'm not predicting the same disaster that has so many people motivated to call for a pause or a slow down or whatever has been happening.
1743000	1750000	So there's a school of thought that says that the biggest problem with AI is alignment.
1750000	1760000	That the AI could either view us as competitors and it could seek to eliminate us just to free up the world for its own purposes.
1760000	1764000	Or it could misunderstand what it's being directed to do.
1764000	1776000	And as a result of that misunderstanding, it could end up harming or destroying us incidentally as an attempt to accomplish something else to which it had been directed.
1776000	1786000	I think the second of those scenarios is more likely than the first, but I don't think either of them is especially likely in the short term.
1786000	1800000	And I don't think we're likely to get there because the other much more mundane dangers that come along with AI are liable to destabilize our system far earlier.
1800000	1815000	So the fact that we have this dawning capacity for computers to either think or to speak in such a way that is indistinguishable from the consequence of thought.
1815000	1819000	And I'm not sure there's any distinction between those two things at all in a meaningful sense.
1819000	1831000	But the fact that this is now a dawning capability has profound implications for the way we interact with each other.
1831000	1839000	That everyone is going to have access to AIs at one level or another and that they are going to be able to use those things.
1839000	1860000	Yes, sometimes productively, but also deceptively, that they will be able to portray themselves as more competent than they actually are by offloading the hard work to this automated black box creates a tremendous hazard to any notion of merit.
1861000	1875000	That is to say, are we about to see an era in which the people who succeed are the ones that figure out how to step aside from this process and allow the AIs to do their work?
1875000	1882000	It is not obvious that you can build a productive culture going forward with those sorts of rules.
1882000	1896000	It is also the case that people will use AIs for malevolent purposes and that will be a force multiplier for those who wish to transfer wealth to themselves,
1896000	1905000	that they will be able to use these things to fool us, to make us think that we've seen things that weren't real, that we've heard from people who didn't actually telephone us.
1905000	1915000	This is a very potent force on behalf of con artists and that's a tremendous danger in itself.
1915000	1926000	And then lastly, I would just point to the fact that the con artists having access to these tools and people pretending to be competent will have access to them
1926000	1940000	and that these things will infuse themselves into our social media environments making it impossible for us to know what's true
1940000	1948000	and to distinguish that from things that we are being induced to believe are true for some other purpose
1948000	1967000	is going to turn us at best into a population of cynics who reflexively disbelieve everything because we're going to be so used to being embarrassed by trusting something and then turning out to be false.
1968000	1979000	Even that last possibility which I regard as all but certain is enough to put civilization in terrible jeopardy.
1979000	1989000	So in light of that, I'm not hopeful and it's not because I believe that the AIs are going to turn on us.
1989000	1995000	It's possible but I'm worried about far more mundane things coming far sooner.
1995000	2002000	It seems like it's already happening. I wonder if something like Pearl Harbor or 9-11 happened today.
2002000	2012000	We'd probably be debating whether it actually happened or not because every time something happens it goes through the same cycle of something happens
2012000	2021000	and we're trying to figure out what are the two opinions of this thing that are going to emerge and then what side is going to adopt that opinion
2021000	2027000	and then everybody kind of just makes that opinion get more extreme and then we get bored of it.
2027000	2035000	Somebody comes forward with a very logical take on what happened and then people just move on to the next thing, you know?
2035000	2039000	It's like we don't even care.
2039000	2045000	Yep, cynicism is going to become the new wisdom.
2045000	2049000	Yeah, and it seems like cynicism has taken over.
2049000	2058000	You know, Friedrich Nietzsche famously said God is dead but I almost feel like that's another way of saying optimism is dead
2058000	2071000	where I've done a couple videos on nihilism lately and it seems like nihilism has taken over our institutions, our cities and people in general.
2071000	2079000	They don't have a sense of meaning anymore and like you said, this AI is taking away merit.
2079000	2083000	Anytime something's difficult, why not just have the AI do it?
2083000	2088000	Well, it turns out that doing difficult things is what gives our life meaning.
2088000	2096000	So it's hard not to, you know, when the candy is right there of the AI, it's saying here's the answer, here's what you want.
2096000	2099000	If you want to make a song, I'll write it for you.
2099000	2105000	But really the difficulty of writing that song is what makes the song beautiful in the end, I feel like.
2105000	2107000	100%.
2107000	2115000	No, it's a tragedy from the point of view of the motivation to do things that are worthwhile.
2115000	2124000	And it's going to seem like a strange analogy, but I think we've already seen a near apocalyptic catastrophe
2124000	2133000	that has unfolded as a result of the much more mundane process of people being sold porn by an industry that doesn't care about them.
2133000	2142000	That fact has messed up all of the incentives around partnering romantically
2142000	2151000	and people, if you're young enough not to remember how the world was, you may think that that sounds preposterous,
2151000	2157000	but somebody is defending the idea that romance as it was in movies was ever real.
2157000	2159000	And that's not it.
2159000	2167000	There was just simply a system in which people were compelled by something internal to themselves to partner,
2167000	2171000	whether they rationally thought that was a good idea or not.
2171000	2181000	And it resulted in a very important, powerful human process functioning correctly.
2181000	2194000	And the combination of technological birth control and pornography has now wrecked all of the incentive structures in that system
2194000	2205000	and replaced it with nothing meaningful, and it is resulting in people paradoxically not being sexually satisfied as a result of their liberation,
2205000	2223000	not seeing the wisdom in having a family, not understanding the nature of the creature that they have become through a three and a half billion year process of evolution.
2224000	2231000	Yeah, it seems like in our modern world, there are two archetypes that are emerging that have become so prominent.
2231000	2241000	They're like a cultural meme at this point, but that of the incel, the involuntary celibate who just stays online all day,
2241000	2250000	and the only fans model who is kind of willfully objectifying themselves and selling their bodies.
2250000	2254000	It seems like these two archetypes have emerged simultaneously.
2254000	2261000	And I'd love to get your take from like an evolutionary point of view, like what is happening here?
2261000	2265000	Why have these two things emerged simultaneously?
2265000	2272000	And is there a way to get romance, the traditional form of romance back?
2273000	2281000	If there is to be hope for Gen Z, it is going to have to figure out how to step off this stupid treadmill and do something different.
2281000	2296000	And I really, I'm stunned by the fact that there doesn't appear to be a movement of Gen Z folks opting out of the sophistications or pseudo sophistications of their era.
2296000	2304000	I'm hoping it will emerge. I'm expecting it any day, but I have yet to see it.
2304000	2313000	I like your parallel between the incel on the one hand and the only fans model on the other.
2313000	2321000	It's like an involuntarily celibate male and an involuntarily hypersexual female.
2321000	2325000	And people will say, well, what do you mean involuntary? They're deciding to have an only fans account.
2325000	2339000	Well, no, what they are doing is they are being driven to only fans or its equivalent by the lack of good options, sexually speaking.
2339000	2349000	The only viable option is to monetize your sexuality if you're beautiful enough to do it and hope to reach a large audience.
2349000	2355000	Because effectively it would be hard to find a man worth partnering with.
2355000	2371000	The society is so confused that most men who in theory could be mates don't have the skill set nor the opportunities to bring to the table that would ordinarily cause them to find a partner.
2371000	2380000	And so finding many fractional partners is what these only fans models are doing.
2380000	2387000	Now, of course, for almost all of them, it is not economically viable, but for a tiny number it is.
2387000	2399000	And just like with basketball stars causing people growing up in oppressed circumstances to think maybe that's the way out of the ghetto,
2399000	2407000	is to play basketball when in fact just the simple number of places there are to earn money playing basketball
2407000	2413000	and the number of people who simultaneously had that thought makes it very unlikely to work.
2413000	2424000	We have the same kinds of dynamics and the result is that the market causes the exploitation of people who are not going to get a good deal.
2424000	2435000	It's only a tiny number of Taylor Swift's who find themselves extremely wealthy as a result of I'm not sure what exactly.
2435000	2443000	I hope people don't think I'm analogizing her to an only fans model, although it's not an entirely distinct phenomenon.
2443000	2451000	I see her on stage wearing absurdly provocative costumes and I think to myself,
2451000	2457000	so is she really in charge or has the system kind of enslaved her?
2457000	2465000	And it's not really one or the other. She's obviously beyond wealthy and can make the news at will.
2465000	2477000	But nonetheless, it doesn't look to me like the choices that somebody who really had achieved a level of power over their own life would be making.
2478000	2491000	I recently got engaged and my fiance, she has a pretty big YouTube platform as well and she's never really showed much skin.
2491000	2501000	She's never done any of those and I asked her why she's never done that and she said that once you do that, nobody will ever take you seriously.
2502000	2507000	All you have to do is do it once and nobody will ever take you seriously after that.
2507000	2517000	And I thought that that was such a good point and I've seen interviews of street interviews where people go around and say,
2517000	2523000	just off the cuff, they find like a group of people and they're like, would you date a girl that had an only fans?
2523000	2526000	And for most men, it seems like that's a deal breaker.
2526000	2531000	And for women, it's also a deal breaker. Would you date a guy that followed girls on only fans?
2531000	2543000	They say, oh no. So it seems like this way of life is being incentivized, yet it's completely at odds with traditional romance and what could actually connect us.
2543000	2558000	Not only that, but if we go back to porn for a second, the porn industry is composed of a bunch of different companies that are competing with each other
2558000	2560000	and they're all selling the same thing.
2560000	2570000	So in order to capture people's attention, they are forced to compete in the extremeness of what they are presenting,
2570000	2578000	which forces them directly into taboos. So they are breaking every taboo for very mundane economic reasons.
2578000	2597000	And the problem with that is that the human creature is built to discover what sex is and they discover it in part through the observation of other people,
2597000	2609000	most of which is hidden, but there's a certain amount that one can observe, and then they discover it through an intensely bonding exploration with somebody else,
2609000	2617000	a very private exploration that unites you in a secret kind of knowledge.
2617000	2635000	By replacing that natural process of discovery with porn saturated with taboos, we are actually distorting the sexual development of the people who find this stuff early in life,
2635000	2641000	which is almost every male, and I'm now led to believe.
2641000	2660000	And what is very hard to say to these folks is by participating in that, by consuming that content, you are destroying your own sexual mind,
2660000	2672000	and you are harming your future partner, and by doing that, you're changing your whole life.
2672000	2681000	You don't think you're making a decision, it's changing your life. You think you'll do it, and if it's not good, you'll stop, and maybe you will.
2681000	2693000	But the question is, you can't go back to whatever your mind would have done. You can't build the relationship you would have built if you have seen so many of these images,
2693000	2707000	and your mind has, because it has no resistance to this, because it has seen it with its own photoreceptors, you have taken it in as if that's a real portrayal of human sex,
2707000	2715000	and it isn't. That's a market force. That's not what passion does.
2715000	2725000	So really, for many years, I suffered the accusation of being approved for saying things like this, and I'm not approved.
2725000	2732000	I'm not even against sexually explicit content. Erotic is fine. That's an ancient form.
2732000	2738000	I'm against what the market is doing to sex, which I think is extremely dangerous.
2738000	2747000	And it seems like the incentives plus the emerging AI could just add gas to that fire.
2747000	2759000	Because right now we have real women who are taking pictures and putting filters on and photoshopping and whatever they can do, but they're actually doing that themselves.
2759000	2769000	What if we take away the human woman with the soul and just replace it with an AI that is designed to get you to pay attention to it as long as possible?
2769000	2776000	And it could exploit our brains just like fast food has exploited us. There's no limit to that.
2776000	2793000	It can and it will. And even worse than that, we are already at the point where AI can attach somebody's face to pornography who didn't consent to it.
2793000	2819000	And so imagine that your sexual mind is being instructed by this profit driven industry, and it gets the ability to attach the face of your crush to these violent or otherwise troubling images.
2820000	2829000	And then how exactly are you supposed to navigate a relationship with that person? Should they find you attractive?
2829000	2846000	It's going to destroy what little value remains in that landscape, and it just doesn't leave a path forward in which there is an honorable relationship between men and women.
2847000	2861000	And from like an evolutionary standpoint, does this point towards extinction or does this point to maybe like people figure out a new way to breed digitally?
2861000	2877000	You know, it takes an awful lot to create extinction. I see that hazard in various things that we're doing. I don't see it in the absolute destruction of normal relation between the sexes,
2877000	2899000	because, you know, it only takes a small number of people to figure it out to keep the species going. And in fact, you know, you can imagine all kinds of dystopias in which eggs and sperm are joined in some way and technologically brought to maturity or surrogacy becomes economically driven by people who
2900000	2910000	want to produce children for reasons of vanity or whatever. You know, so there are lots of ways in which humanity can go forward.
2911000	2928000	But from the point of view of a civilization that makes sense, the importance of sexual and romantic drive cannot be overstated.
2929000	2944000	For almost all of our history as humans, the desire to become worthy of a sexual relationship has motivated men to accomplish great things.
2945000	2962000	It is in large measure the fuel that created civilization by eliminating that incentive structure by making sex common, disgusting, dangerous.
2963000	2982000	We are removing the thing that caused us to find this way of being, and I'm afraid, although it's hard to predict the particulars of the way that goes wrong, the general trajectory is clear.
2982000	2994000	Again, the right thing to do is for young people to say, actually, I can see the problem, and I'm going to opt out, and I'm going to interact with those who have also opted out.
2994000	3003000	I don't know why that movement has not arisen yet, but when it does, it will not be a moment too soon.
3003000	3013000	I heard a quote from Andrew Huberman recently, and he said, our species is going to select for those who can self-regulate.
3013000	3028000	And I think in the past it was, it selected for those who could seek out sugary foods and seek out pleasure, you know, who could go to great lengths to seek that reward out.
3028000	3038000	But now we're surrounded by reward. There's so much abundance that it's like, who can put guardrails on and just self-regulate?
3038000	3045000	Those are going to be the people who are able to pass their genes on, perhaps.
3045000	3052000	I mean, I see his point. I just don't know that we get to a place where you get a coherent selective regime.
3052000	3070000	What we have is an outbreak of tyranny, that it's not obvious what it's for, but one thing that it is plausibly for is to control a population of people that doesn't have a North Star,
3070000	3080000	that hasn't been cut in on the potential for an honorable adult life.
3080000	3091000	What do you do about, you know, billions of angry people? Well, maybe you erect control structures so that no matter what they think, it doesn't matter to you as an elite.
3091000	3100000	Again, I'm not saying that is what's going on, but I do see an awful lot of tyrannical structures being created before our eyes under false pretenses.
3101000	3116000	And I see an awful lot of people who look like they are headed for a French Revolution moment, and it's hard not to put those two facts together.
3116000	3134000	Yeah, so do you think there's any deliberate orchestrated thing going on that is trying to control the population and maybe purposely de-incentivizing people for romance, and do you think any of this is deliberate?
3134000	3148000	Yeah, I have no doubt that a substantial amount of it is deliberate, and I think we can't see that because the actors in question are ones that we have some historical relationship to that causes us to imagine this is impossible.
3148000	3168000	So for example, if I look at the Democratic Party in the U.S. and I see something acting in a completely villainous way that appears to have no compassion whatsoever for the suffering of average working class people.
3168000	3173000	It seems to willingly create that suffering and doesn't seem to care a bit.
3173000	3178000	That's hard for me to accept because this was the party of working class people.
3178000	3187000	But if I step aside and I say, well I actually have to be agnostic about what the Democratic Party is, I know what it was or I think I do.
3187000	3204000	But what it is might be a corruption and influence peddling racket that has had, that has pedaled its influence to the Chinese Communist Party, and that's just one possibility.
3204000	3223000	But if the Democratic Party had pedaled influence to the Chinese Communist Party and the Chinese Communist Party had instructed it through its newfound influence to create policies in which Americans harm themselves,
3223000	3234000	that would be a natural. That's certainly simpler and safer than confronting a country like the U.S. on a battlefield.
3234000	3249000	So why wouldn't I expect this? Maybe the error is in thinking of the Democratic Party as an American political party rather than a loophole through which corruption of any kind can find its way into our governing structure.
3249000	3265000	That's a really interesting point because years ago I heard a talk from a really profound talk about how you demoralize a nation in a way where it's called an ideological subversion.
3265000	3281000	Where you essentially take over the minds of within a country so much so that you don't have to take it over, you've effectively taken it over through a subversion and it takes about one generation to do this.
3281000	3299000	You turn a very patriotic, traditional country, you completely demoralize their youth and get them to hate their own country and destroy all their morals and values, and then at that point it's basically taken over.
3299000	3303000	There's no need for a single gunshot to be fired.
3303000	3315000	Yeah, I believe that that's true and I believe that we are ever more vulnerable to it the more people experience life through a screen.
3315000	3342000	The fact is if you have a close relationship with the physical world and it almost doesn't matter what the nature of that relationship is, whether you are devoted to a sport or to growing a garden or to pursuing wildlife with a camera or whether you're doing carpentry,
3343000	3360000	anything that forces you to interact with the actual world in a way that success and failure are not socially determined, they are determined by forces beyond anyone's control, that trains the mind to understand the way things actually work.
3360000	3370000	If your entire experience of the world is social and it doesn't even have to be screens, it can also be the professor at the front of the room.
3370000	3390000	If you think that you have learned how something is because the person at the front of the room gave you high marks, you're depending on the fact that the person at the front of the room isn't a moron or isn't a coward who has accepted false things in order to save themselves.
3390000	3412000	So anything in which your sense of what's right and wrong is socially determined is a hazard and for almost our entire population, even the educated don't know anything personally and because they don't know anything personally, the ability to demoralize them and convince them of false things is all the greater.
3412000	3417000	They don't know how to determine when something might just simply be false.
3418000	3440000	And it seems like our education system has moved away from teaching these concrete life skills and it's gotten way more into teaching these social things and social things change so rapidly that if you get a degree in gender studies today in two years, is any of that knowledge relevant?
3440000	3449000	But if you learn how to play an instrument, you're still going to know how to play those songs forever, hopefully.
3449000	3452000	So is that kind of what you're saying?
3452000	3465000	I often make this point to my children by talking to them about the distinction between knowing how something is done and knowing how to do it.
3465000	3478000	You could read every book there is on tennis and you could know a tremendous amount about the game so that you could watch it and you could deliver very high quality commentary.
3478000	3483000	And then I could put a tennis racket in your hand and if you've never played the game, you're going to be completely inept.
3483000	3487000	You know how tennis is played but you don't know how to play tennis.
3487000	3499000	So my point would be young people now convince themselves that they are expert in things because they've done a lot of reading on it and they have very strong opinions on it.
3499000	3507000	But they would be far better off even if they just chose a couple of different realms where they were going to develop the skill to do the thing.
3507000	3512000	Then they would be able to look at the stuff in the books and they would say, you know what, I actually disagree with that.
3512000	3517000	I don't care that you're the most elevated expert in this field.
3517000	3520000	You're actually wrong about it and here's why.
3520000	3526000	That ability to know when the experts are wrong is crucial and the fact is most people have nothing but experts.
3526000	3531000	That's all they've got and when the experts go crazy, they go crazy right along with them.
3532000	3543000	You just reminded me, I just had a conversation with a friend who lost about 50 grand trying to start a business and it kind of fell apart and he was really down on himself.
3543000	3552000	And I was thinking, well, if you had went to get an MBA, you would have spent a lot more than 50 grand and known a lot less.
3552000	3557000	So I mean, you learned an incredible amount trying to make this business work.
3557000	3561000	You know, like, don't just take this as a failure. This is not the end of the road.
3561000	3567000	Can you get back up and take what you've learned and apply it to a new business?
3567000	3569000	No, it's a marvelous point.
3569000	3575000	The lesson may well have been worth a tremendous amount more than 50,000 bucks.
3575000	3578000	Yeah.
3578000	3582000	Well, that was really informative. Everything you just said.
3582000	3585000	Really? Because I was kidding.
3585000	3588000	I mean, like the whole last hour we've been talking.
3588000	3592000	That's what I'm talking about. This has been one shaggy dog story.
3592000	3596000	I don't believe any of that shit, man.
3596000	3598000	I do actually believe it.
3598000	3599000	Yeah.
3599000	3601000	I am now kidding.
3601000	3603000	Excellent.
3603000	3608000	Well, are you tired of talking about Sam Harris?
3608000	3611000	I'm willing if there's a reason to do it.
3611000	3615000	I actually didn't have it on my list of things to talk about, but.
3615000	3620000	I was pretty down on Sam Harris for the last couple years,
3620000	3623000	but I'm still willing to hear him out.
3623000	3626000	And I still I still have a shred of respect for him.
3626000	3632000	Is there any chance of you two guys becoming buddies again?
3632000	3637000	I'm open, but Sam has to clean up his mess.
3637000	3643000	He he did not hold anything in reserve.
3643000	3649000	He challenged Heather and my credibility in our own fields.
3649000	3653000	And then he turned out to be wrong and refused to acknowledge it,
3653000	3659000	which I consider unless there is some extraordinary explanation for that.
3659000	3671000	I consider that to be evidence of profound cowardice and intellectual dishonesty.
3671000	3678000	Now, what Sam has to do to find his way back is to recognize his error
3678000	3679000	and to own up to it.
3679000	3683000	And I wouldn't mind hearing how it is he got there,
3683000	3691000	but pretending that he had it right, that I guessed correctly based on evidence
3691000	3693000	that really pointed in the other direction.
3693000	3697000	And it was just the accumulation later of evidence that turned out
3697000	3701000	to make my position seem prescient when, in fact, it had been foolish.
3701000	3702000	That's nonsense.
3702000	3705000	That is not a robust thought.
3705000	3711000	And what's more, you can tell that this is garbage because he refuses to talk to me about it.
3711000	3712000	And there's a reason for that.
3712000	3716000	It would be very embarrassing if he deployed that argument and I got to respond.
3716000	3721000	So it requires me not to be in the room in order for him to say stuff like that.
3721000	3724000	So I would love it.
3724000	3730000	Yeah, I love this mess, but I'm not expecting it.
3730000	3735000	Yeah, I think all it would take is one simple kind of apology from Sam
3735000	3736000	and just saying, Hey, I was wrong.
3736000	3738000	This is what I got wrong.
3738000	3740000	I've never, I don't listen to him much anymore,
3740000	3742000	but I haven't heard that from him.
3742000	3747000	And I would love to see you two talk it out on like Joe Rogan.
3747000	3749000	That'd be that'd be insane.
3749000	3752000	But yep, I doubt he's open to that.
3752000	3754000	But he doesn't seem to be open to anything.
3754000	3755000	I've invited him.
3755000	3759000	I have bent over backwards to provide mechanisms for interaction
3759000	3764000	that neutralize all of the concerns that he has voiced about what might happen.
3764000	3766000	And still, I get nothing back.
3766000	3775000	So my sense is some part of him knows that he was terribly wrong and can't face it.
3775000	3783000	Yeah, well, yeah.
3783000	3787000	So I was really excited for our conversation today.
3787000	3789000	I have tons of notes.
3789000	3793000	So, and I don't, you know, I'm pretty new to podcasting,
3793000	3797000	but I don't usually have pages and pages of notes like this.
3797000	3803000	But one thing that I've been really interested in is the Younger Dryas theory
3803000	3806000	and the impact hypothesis.
3806000	3809000	I've gone to the sites.
3809000	3812000	I've gone all through the scablands with Randall Carlson.
3812000	3817000	I'm a big fan of Graham Hancock and Joe Rogan's podcast has been big.
3817000	3820000	I mean, this is a big idea that he constantly bangs on.
3820000	3828000	And I would love to get your take on the Younger Dryas event and the possibility
3828000	3833000	of a civilization existing before that into the Ice Age.
3833000	3836000	Is there any possibility of that?
3836000	3840000	Yeah, I'm open to it and I find some of that evidence quite compelling.
3840000	3846000	I will tell you, I've spent a great deal of time in the scablands
3846000	3853000	and I am intimately familiar with the historical development
3853000	3857000	of the so-called Brett's Flood Hypothesis.
3857000	3862000	In fact, I used to teach it, so just for the sake of your listeners not being confused,
3862000	3864000	Brett's is B-R-E-T-Z.
3864000	3870000	He was a geologist who recognized that the extraordinary structures
3870000	3876000	in the scablands of Eastern Washington were completely inconsistent
3876000	3882000	with the explanation that was used to describe how they were formed.
3882000	3890000	In essence, in the post-Lyle period, geologists had fallen in love with the idea
3890000	3893000	that any sudden explanation was effectively biblical
3893000	3900000	and that these structures were all produced through very gradual processes
3900000	3902000	over very long periods of time.
3902000	3906000	And indeed, that is how things like the Grand Canyon have been formed.
3906000	3911000	But the scablands of Eastern Washington had features that Brett's realized
3911000	3914000	simply couldn't be accounted for in this way.
3914000	3923000	And what he concluded was that there was an utterly profound and sudden flood
3923000	3927000	that had come through Eastern Washington.
3927000	3935000	And when he deployed this hypothesis for the first time in, I think, 1922,
3935000	3941000	he was ridiculed across the field.
3941000	3946000	And he spent decades fighting to make the point
3946000	3949000	that actually the evidence simply pointed to a massive flood.
3949000	3954000	And we now know that that's correct and that it was not even just one flood,
3954000	3956000	but it was a repeated pattern of flooding.
3956000	3959000	And we know why the floods happened, which I can tell you in a second.
3959000	3967000	But the point is he went from a pariah in geology,
3967000	3974000	ridiculed as a fringe lunatic, to winning geology's highest prize
3974000	3979000	between the period of 1922 and then 1978 is when he was awarded the prize.
3979000	3986000	In fact, when he was asked about it, he said that everybody he felt like calling up to gloat was already dead.
3986000	3993000	But the point of the story, to me, there are many.
3993000	3998000	One, you can't tell just because somebody is being ridiculed by an entire field
3998000	4001000	for having apparently not understood the evidence.
4001000	4003000	That doesn't tell you whether they're right or wrong.
4003000	4007000	And in fact, you should be very interested if this is an intelligent person
4007000	4011000	who is unpersuaded by the supposed evidence that says they're wrong.
4011000	4016000	You should hear them out and you should figure out, you know, in the case of the scab lands,
4016000	4022000	I used to enjoy taking students there because nobody knew this story.
4022000	4026000	You could rely on the fact that students were not aware of what the scab lands were
4026000	4029000	and what had created them.
4029000	4032000	So I could actually lead students into the scab lands
4032000	4035000	and I could just show them the evidence that Bretz was proceeding from
4035000	4038000	and I could show them why it was a paradox.
4038000	4046000	You know, I could stand on a giant granite boulder in the middle of an open prairie
4046000	4050000	and I could stand on it and I could say, this is a glacial erratic.
4050000	4054000	Glacial erratics are transported by slow-moving glaciers
4054000	4059000	which carve out rock from mountains and push it ahead of them
4059000	4065000	and then when the glaciers recede, the rocks are left in places that they are geologically foreign.
4065000	4067000	The students would say, oh, that's fascinating.
4067000	4069000	I would say the problem is there were never any glaciers here
4069000	4072000	and yet I'm standing on a glacial erratic.
4072000	4074000	How can that be?
4074000	4079000	I could do that and then I could show them the pattern of the carving out of the valleys,
4079000	4086000	the fact that the shape of the valleys was inconsistent with gradual erosion or glaciers.
4086000	4092000	I could show them the world's largest waterfall, now completely dry
4092000	4096000	and the question is, well, how could this waterfall possibly be here?
4096000	4098000	What might have fed it?
4098000	4103000	So that ability to show students these structures, to show them the paradox
4103000	4110000	and then to reveal over the space of a day what actually had produced the scablands
4110000	4117000	and then to describe the story of J. Harlan Bretz and the battles that he went through
4117000	4124000	to tell the story of J. T. Pardee, the geologist who, when Bretz had revealed his hypothesis
4124000	4128000	and had immediately drawn the ridicule of his colleagues,
4128000	4133000	Pardee, who had been a geologist with the U.S. Geological Survey
4133000	4138000	who was very smart but didn't have Bretz's courage,
4138000	4142000	he leaned over to the guy next to him and he said, I know where the water came from.
4142000	4148000	He knew in 1922 the explanation that Bretz couldn't put his finger on
4148000	4152000	where was the water coming from that made this gigantic flood.
4152000	4161000	So anyway, my point is, I think one thing we don't do a good job of in science
4161000	4168000	is providing a history in which people realize that the things that we come to understand
4168000	4175000	as obvious from the evidence may originally have faced ridicule
4175000	4179000	and therefore the sound of ridicule shouldn't tell you anything.
4180000	4186000	So that's about as far as I can go with respect to the Younger Dryas event
4186000	4192000	and the particular hypothesis of advanced civilizations having pre-existed,
4192000	4198000	but I'm open to it precisely because I know that the fact that many people think it's laughable,
4198000	4201000	if anything, that just makes it interesting.
4203000	4206000	Wow, I am blown away by how much you know about it
4206000	4210000	because I've been looking into this stuff for a while and you just said it all
4210000	4218000	and I'm curious, where did you suspect that water came from on those floods?
4218000	4227000	The water came from a ice dam that blocked the Clark Fork River
4227000	4234000	and so the basic pattern is you have a glaciation, these fingers of ice spread down from the poles.
4234000	4242000	They actually don't get all that far. The Canadian-U.S. border is kind of where those glaciers stop for the most part
4242000	4248000	and our sense that there are glaciers much farther south is those are alpine glaciers
4248000	4251000	so Yosemite was indeed formed by glaciers during the Ice Age
4251000	4255000	but those were descending from high mountains rather than from the poles.
4255000	4259000	In any case, these glacial fingers reach down from the poles,
4259000	4264000	a particular glacial finger because of the idiosyncrasies of the land
4264000	4269000	and the pattern of temperature that's based on the circulation of the atmosphere
4269000	4273000	results in this finger blocking the Clark Fork River.
4273000	4278000	When the Clark Fork River gets blocked, water builds up behind it
4278000	4282000	creating what we now call glacial lake Missoula
4282000	4286000	which would have been an incredibly deep lake.
4286000	4289000	It was 1500 feet deep, something like that.
4289000	4294000	It was an incredibly large amount of water the size of two modern-day Great Lakes
4294000	4303000	and that would have sat behind this dam and then what happens is a process.
4303000	4308000	When you have that amount of water, it creates a tremendous amount of pressure at the bottom.
4308000	4315000	That pressure because water increases in volume when it freezes.
4315000	4321000	That pressure prevents water from freezing and so it is able to be super-cooled.
4321000	4325000	It can be below the freezing temperature of water and it cannot solidify
4325000	4328000	because that pressure is keeping it from doing so.
4328000	4336000	What we now understand is that that super-cooled water actually trickled through cracks in the dam
4336000	4344000	and opened weaknesses and the dam exploded letting loose this entire gigantic lake
4344000	4349000	which then rushed at a speed of something like 60 miles an hour across the landscape
4349000	4357000	scouring it and destroying it, literally grinding up the stuff that was on the surface moments before
4357000	4363000	and created this largest waterfall that ever flowed on the face of the earth
4363000	4371000	and then careened down the rest of the scablands and into what is now the Columbia River Gorge.
4371000	4378000	It was actually created by the same flood and all of that water flowed out towards the Pacific.
4378000	4384000	It washed into the Willamette Valley, in part the Willamette Valley in Oregon is fertile.
4384000	4390000	It is great farmland in part because the materials that were in eastern Washington got washed into it
4390000	4395000	and then it washed out into the Pacific.
4395000	4404000	The point is because the triggering event of this is the growth of the ice dam that blocks the Clark Fork River
4404000	4409000	and because that ice sheet, that finger of ice grows in the same place
4409000	4414000	because the conditions that created the first time remained there even after the lake had emptied out
4414000	4420000	this happened repeatedly. The finger of ice blocked the river, the lake builds up,
4420000	4426000	the super-cooled water creates the fissures and the dam and the dam explodes and it happens once again.
4426000	4436000	The scablands are really the outwash of this glacial process that we just simply can't directly observe.
4436000	4444000	Now, interestingly, because the last ice age took place so recently, I don't think we know for sure
4444000	4449000	but it is quite possible that there were humans who actually observed this event.
4449000	4456000	This was not in the distant past, we're talking about 15,000 years ago.
4456000	4465000	So anyway, when you think about the kinds of stories that get handed down, these colossal floods,
4465000	4470000	one possibility is that actually colossal floods are something that has been observed and has made quite an impression
4470000	4479000	and has been inscribed into myths precisely because it was so significant that people were utterly compelled
4479000	4486000	to report what they had seen and it got handed down one generation after another.
4486000	4494000	Do you think that this scablands flood was an isolated event or perhaps it was part of like a global,
4494000	4500000	something happened to the globe at that period that triggered massive change globally?
4500000	4506000	Well, you know, let's put it this way, which you've just suggested is definitely true.
4506000	4515000	The way that Molankovitch oscillations create ice ages and interglacial periods, that is...
4515000	4518000	What are Molankovitch?
4518000	4535000	The Molankovitch cycles are oscillations in the Earth's orbit that very slightly adjust the amount of the sun's energy that is trapped here.
4535000	4540000	And so there are three major Molankovitch cycles.
4541000	4549000	They involve the angle of tilt of the Earth, which is not stable at the moment.
4549000	4555000	It's 23 and a half degrees, but there is an oscillation in the degree of tilt.
4555000	4567000	There is an oscillation in the degree of obliquity of the orbit of the Earth, how round versus oval the orbit is.
4567000	4575000	And then there is an oscillation of the procession of the axis of rotation of the Earth.
4575000	4579000	So the North Star is not always where the North Pole points.
4579000	4583000	And these things are on very different timescales.
4583000	4590000	We have a 100,000 year timescale, a roughly 41,000 year timescale, and a roughly 20,000 year timescale.
4590000	4600000	These are out of phase, but when they all happen together in such a way that causes slightly cooler northern summers,
4600000	4610000	that is to say the northern hemisphere has a summer that is slightly cooler than normal because these oscillations have all reduced the amount of solar energy,
4610000	4615000	that causes ice to remain that would have melted otherwise.
4615000	4625000	So in other words, the glacial tops of mountains, the degree of the poles is slightly preserved beyond average.
4625000	4636000	And when that happens, because ice is white and reflects energy back into space, the next summer tends to be even a little bit cooler
4636000	4643000	because now you've got some of the energy that would have been absorbed by the dark ocean, for example,
4643000	4651000	bounced back into space, which causes the next summer to be slightly cooler, which causes slightly more ice to remain,
4651000	4656000	which causes more energy to be bounced back into space, which causes the next summer to be slightly cooler, etc.
4656000	4660000	And so here you get the glaciers descending down from the poles.
4660000	4671000	And this continues until there is enough out of phaseness of the Milankovitch cycles for the process to reverse,
4671000	4677000	where you get an abnormally slightly warm summer and that causes slightly more ice to melt,
4677000	4685000	which causes slightly more energy to be absorbed by the dark earth underneath or the water and the process reverses.
4685000	4698000	So at one level, you've got a planet that has these slight oscillations in its orbit that cause a regular oscillation between glacial and interglacial,
4698000	4709000	and that is enough to trigger this reflectance mechanism, what's called albedo, the reflectance of light back into space,
4709000	4714000	that causes that, which is really the driver of these glaciation events.
4714000	4718000	So we have one layer at which we know this is true.
4718000	4725000	And then there's a question about what other things might function in a way to radically alter the nature of the earth.
4725000	4743000	And there are some truly frightening possibilities on that list, including the possibility that fluctuations of what is internal to the earth might cause a massive disruption
4743000	4752000	in the orientation of the earth in space, which can radically alter the facts of life on this planet.
4753000	4761000	That is far less certain, but let's just say, when one looks at the evidence, very difficult to dismiss.
4761000	4769000	That was beautifully explained how this gradual process of these forces can tip the world in one direction or another.
4769000	4772000	When they align towards cold, they can get really, really cold.
4772000	4778000	But it seems like we broke out of that ice age very, very rapidly.
4778000	4788000	We've seen those Greenland ice cores, where they have a really dramatic, there's a really dramatic end to the younger driest,
4788000	4791000	where the temperature just, you know, it's not gradual.
4791000	4797000	What happens in like five, maybe 10 years, where we just shoot out of the ice age.
4797000	4802000	Yeah, that is definitely not predicted by a Malankovitch alone, that's for sure.
4803000	4812000	So I think the idea that I've gotten from Graham Hancock and Randall Carlson is that it was a meteor,
4812000	4814000	because there's this energy paradox.
4814000	4822000	It's like, where did all this energy come from to create this rapid melting or the breakage of these dams
4822000	4827000	that had to come from somewhere, because it's not a gradual thing, you know, these massive floods.
4828000	4837000	And yeah, I think a meteor or something extraterrestrial hitting Earth could be a good explanation,
4837000	4841000	because those things hit Earth a lot more frequently than we think.
4841000	4851000	Yes, I think there is some mechanism inside of academics and intellectuals
4851000	4860000	that causes them to adhere too closely to the familiar,
4860000	4872000	which makes remarkable things for which they have no direct perception seem not worth considering.
4872000	4878000	And, you know, that is why I dearly love the story of J. Harlan Bretz.
4878000	4883000	It allowed me to make this point to students in a way that it would have been difficult otherwise,
4883000	4889000	and the fact that they could physically stand on the rim of that great waterfall, not even knowing what it was.
4889000	4896000	I mean, that was part of the joy of this was hiking them up to the rim of this waterfall and saying,
4896000	4898000	do you know what you're looking at?
4898000	4904000	You're looking at the largest waterfall that ever flowed on the face of the Earth, and it's perfectly dry.
4904000	4906000	How could that be?
4907000	4918000	You know, it's almost the perfect example of stepping outside of the realm of the purely social
4918000	4921000	in order that the physical world can make its point.
4921000	4926000	There's something about standing on the rim of that waterfall and realizing that you just hiked all the way up it
4926000	4930000	and it didn't occur to you that that's what you were doing.
4930000	4937000	Yeah, I think that's the great value of going out into the real world and just learning things firsthand.
4937000	4944000	I remember I had been, I just assumed because of what all I've been taught that climate change was a fact
4944000	4949000	and that everything is getting warmer and I remember probably 10 years ago I went to New Zealand
4949000	4954000	and I went and saw a glacier down there and I just assumed that it was shrinking.
4954000	4957000	I said, oh, wow, how big did this used to be?
4957000	4959000	And they said, oh, it's actually growing.
4959000	4962000	And I was like, I didn't think they could grow.
4962000	4970000	And just, you know, just by being there and seeing firsthand that, okay, you know, it is rare, but some glaciers still grow.
4970000	4979000	I think that got me going down a rabbit hole of, okay, maybe there is something to alternate narratives or, you know,
4979000	4981000	don't just take the experts at face value.
4981000	4989000	No, I mean, the experts who first told us that we were going to have a snowball Earth
4989000	4997000	and then switched to global warming and promised us that the Arctic was going to be ice free,
4997000	5004000	that the snows of Kilimanjaro were going to be gone, that Glacier National Park was going to have no glaciers.
5005000	5008000	I'm not saying there's nothing to global warming,
5008000	5015000	but I am saying these experts are obviously not good at predicting the future
5015000	5023000	and given that prediction is the only measure we have for insight, that ought to trouble us.
5023000	5031000	Are we really going to turn civilization upside down over a hypothesis being delivered by people who keep being wrong?
5031000	5035000	That doesn't sound like a good idea to me.
5035000	5043000	Yeah, it's very difficult to know that if we gave them these experts a trillion dollars, how would they spend it
5043000	5048000	and how could we even measure the effects of that spendage?
5048000	5053000	And how much do we want to sacrifice our progress today?
5053000	5059000	You know, do we need to live in the Stone Age so we can have some future in 100 years from now
5059000	5063000	that we don't even know for certain if it's, you know, we can't predict?
5063000	5066000	So how much do we want to sacrifice now?
5066000	5076000	Well, I actually think that, I do think that there is a danger that is real with respect to climate change.
5076000	5085000	That danger is built of facts which I believe are robust and it depends not at all on models.
5085000	5090000	Models are where this kind of analysis goes wrong.
5090000	5096000	It's very easy to make a model that will spit out virtually any answer if you're willing to load in enough parameters.
5096000	5101000	So the fact that it looks compelling doesn't tell you anything.
5101000	5107000	But I do think we know that CO2 is heat trapping.
5107000	5110000	We know that methane is even more so.
5110000	5116000	Those are ancient observations or ancients the wrong term, but it goes back to the Arrhenius equation.
5116000	5119000	We're talking a century old observation.
5119000	5127000	And we know that there's a tremendous amount of frozen methane clathrate in the Arctic.
5127000	5138000	Now, the problem is if we reach a temperature in which methane that has been locked away in the Arctic
5138000	5147000	is suddenly released in some substantial novel quantity, that methane will cause warming
5147000	5151000	because methane traps light energy.
5151000	5160000	If it causes warming and that warming causes the polar ice sheet to retreat
5160000	5167000	because the summer is warmer than it would otherwise be, then that will leave the Earth darker than it had been
5167000	5170000	which will cause more light energy to be trapped.
5170000	5179000	And we will be in that same pattern that ends the glaciation when the Milankovic cycles go out of phase.
5179000	5187000	That same positive feedback will release a tremendous amount of methane that would otherwise have stayed frozen.
5187000	5195000	So that would take global climate out of human control.
5195000	5201000	Now, it would take climate change out of human control.
5201000	5213000	Now, my sense, and so far I think I'm the only person advocating for this, is that there is actually, although I am dead set against the idea of geoengineering
5213000	5219000	because I think geoengineering is almost certain to be a disaster no matter what you do.
5219000	5230000	There is one version of geoengineering for climate change that I am actually until somebody compels me that I've got it wrong in favor of.
5230000	5241000	And that is the deploying of panels that would allow you to adjust the albedo, to adjust the whiteness of the Earth.
5242000	5255000	Now, when albedo is adjusted by the poles, it requires a tremendous amount of surface area because the poles are, well, they are not near the equator
5255000	5259000	and therefore the light that they are capable of reflecting is indirect.
5259000	5262000	It's coming through an awful lot of atmosphere first.
5262000	5274000	But if you were to deploy panels that could be flipped, let's say, so that we could turn them to the white side when we wanted to reflect more energy into space
5274000	5282000	and cool things down or turn them to the black side if we wanted to absorb energy and warm things up,
5282000	5294000	then my sense is we could, at yes, considerable expense and yes, with some environmental degradation, build a mechanism capable of leveraging albedo.
5294000	5298000	No. What did I just say? I said albedo. I meant albedo.
5298000	5299000	Albedo.
5299000	5300000	Yes.
5300000	5301000	Geez.
5301000	5303000	Talk about Freudian slips.
5304000	5318000	Leveraging albedo to control the retreat of glacial ice so as not to enter that methane-based positive feedback.
5318000	5323000	Now, I'm in favor of this both because I think the methane positive feedback is very dangerous.
5323000	5329000	If people want to know what I'm talking about, they should look up the clathrate gun hypothesis.
5329000	5336000	That is to say that this positive feedback would go off like a gun altering the climate of the Earth.
5336000	5344000	And while it may or may not be something that will happen, the mechanism by which it would happen is clearly plausible.
5344000	5358000	If we were to deploy panels that would allow us to control albedo to prevent that from happening, then we would also be in a position to tell all these people who want to install a tyrannical structure on Earth
5358000	5365000	in order to ostensibly reduce our carbon footprint as a species.
5365000	5369000	We could tell them to go to hell because we wouldn't need to do that.
5369000	5379000	We could burn the fossil fuels that are necessary to make our economy continue to work to provide a high quality of life for the citizens of planet Earth.
5379000	5385000	And we could control the consequence at the most logical level.
5385000	5396000	We know from the pattern of ice ages that albedo is a viable control mechanism for climate.
5396000	5400000	It's just not one that humans have the control panel for.
5400000	5407000	If we build that control panel, then we can burn the fossil fuels that we need to burn and we don't have an alternative.
5407000	5414000	The alternative is massive austerity and that austerity will not be felt by the elites, it will be felt by everybody else.
5414000	5425000	So why don't we build ourselves a control mechanism so that if global climate change is the problem that some fear that we have an ability to arrest it,
5425000	5431000	and if it is not the problem that we fear, we have a control mechanism for a rainy day.
5431000	5443000	It seems to me the best solution to this problem and one that removes the excuse from all of the tyrants who are rewriting the rules of planet Earth as we speak.
5444000	5455000	So I'm imagining just some massive 200 mile radius, I don't know, sphere that's white in the middle of the ocean or something.
5455000	5467000	That's just reflecting instead of that dark ocean absorbing the heat, you just have this giant white thing that you can flip over whenever you want.
5467000	5471000	There are a lot of ways you could do it.
5471000	5485000	The ocean would be a good one because the ocean is inherently dark and so the consequence in terms of the payback is high.
5485000	5491000	On the other hand, the technological difficulty of doing this, especially in the remote ocean, is substantial.
5491000	5497000	So it's not obvious to me that the cost benefit analysis leads you to the ocean.
5497000	5510000	And really what I would want is a panel of well-informed experts with no perverse incentives to discuss whether or not this is a viable plan,
5510000	5518000	if it is a viable plan, what is the mechanism for deploying it that is least harmful and most likely to be useful.
5518000	5532000	And the thing I didn't say is the most important thing about this plan is that unlike the other geoengineering plans, it's completely reversible.
5532000	5539000	That is to say, if it turns out that this plan is a mistake for some reason we do not foresee, we can unmake it.
5539000	5547000	That's not true if you dump aluminum into the atmosphere to reflect sunlight.
5547000	5552000	It's not true for virtually any other plan.
5552000	5556000	So the reversibility of the plan is its key selling point.
5556000	5562000	We are not committing ourselves to anything by doing such a thing.
5562000	5569000	It seems like we're doing the exact opposite right now with the urbanization makes things darker.
5569000	5577000	I know that when you measure the temperature in cities, it's quite a lot hotter and solar panels are black.
5577000	5584000	So it seems like we're just adding more darkness to the surface of the earth, which is only going to perpetuate the heating.
5584000	5595000	Yep, and it is also the case that a disturbing portion of the evidence that supposedly tells us that the globe is warming in a dangerous way
5595000	5606000	is potentially accounted for by the urbanization of the places in which data is being collected.
5606000	5613000	Yeah, we've only been really measuring the temperature for how long, like a couple hundred years.
5613000	5625000	So, I mean, the world is 4.5 billion years old, 100 years is like, you know, if the history of the world was a day, that would be like a fraction of a second.
5625000	5635000	Yeah, we have a tiny data set and that data set is of course disproportionately going to be in places where there are people to put out thermometers and read them.
5635000	5651000	So, the chances that this data set is going to be biased by what was once a sparse population where people started taking data that has then been increasingly surrounded by human activity,
5651000	5660000	which not only darkens things, but releases energy, you know, every air conditioner that cools a house is putting out heat on the other side, right?
5660000	5666000	Every factory, all of the internal combustion engines in the cars, these are all putting out heat.
5666000	5677000	That's before you even get to the solar panels that are taking photons and turning them into useful photovoltaic energy.
5677000	5682000	So, yes, how you even measure is a good question.
5682000	5687000	Are you optimistic about the future?
5687000	5691000	Well, I'm a little concerned.
5691000	5702000	I do have something, there is a place from which I drive optimism, which is, actually there are two places that I drive optimism.
5702000	5726000	In engaging in its tyranny, our enemies, the enemies of freedom, have driven every insightful, courageous person with integrity out of all of the institutions.
5726000	5729000	They've driven them out and they've pissed them off.
5729000	5738000	And that means that we have all of the folks that you would want on your side ready to go.
5738000	5747000	These people have just faced tyrants and they are wide awake and that is a very hopeful phenomenon.
5747000	5753000	In fact, I think the force that I call Goliath made a terrible error in doing that.
5753000	5756000	He just handed us every player we could want.
5756000	5758000	So that's one reason to be hopeful.
5758000	5768000	The other reason to be hopeful is that we are talking about a civilization, in evolution we talk about the adaptive landscape,
5768000	5777000	in which opportunities are represented as peaks and hazards to getting to better opportunities are represented as valleys.
5778000	5794000	Our civilization represents an important peak, but there are obviously contradictions in that society that are incapable of addressing the hazards of modernity.
5795000	5806000	There's nothing in our founding documents about the enrichment of uranium, about the controlling of renegade artificial intelligence,
5806000	5817000	about the disruption of development by perversely incentivized corporations running social media platforms with algorithms that distort perception.
5817000	5819000	None of these things.
5819000	5827000	So we have to move to some different way of governing ourselves.
5827000	5833000	I believe the values that undergird our civilization are the correct ones.
5833000	5841000	I believe we should only build civilizations that maximize liberty.
5841000	5844000	Liberty is the only value you can afford to maximize.
5844000	5850000	If you maximize any other value you will crash a bunch of other values, but liberty integrates them all.
5850000	5857000	And so we want a civilization that liberates people meaningfully, not just on paper.
5857000	5868000	And in order to get to that civilization that can do that job in an era of high technology, we're going to have to pass through an adaptive valley.
5868000	5871000	That was dead certain no matter how we did this.
5871000	5877000	So the fact that things look very dark is not in and of itself evidence of where we're headed.
5877000	5883000	We could perish in the adaptive valley or we could find the foothill of the next peak and we could start to climb it.
5883000	5885000	I hope that we do.
5885000	5891000	And I am investing everything I've got in making sure that we do.
5891000	5895000	But I don't think the final chapter has been written.
5895000	5899000	It's late, but as far as I know it's not too late.
5901000	5903000	That's brilliant.
5903000	5910000	I'm very grateful to you and Heather because over the last three years there were some times that seemed really dark.
5910000	5919000	And you two were like a shining light in the darkness and things got really dark for a minute.
5919000	5922000	And I remember thinking, is this it?
5922000	5925000	Are we really going down into tyranny?
5925000	5931000	And it was around that time I made a video on mass psychosis that went viral.
5931000	5934000	It got picked up by everybody.
5934000	5936000	Even Alex Jones put it on his show for three.
5936000	5939000	He did a three hour show about that video.
5939000	5942000	Trump saw Tucker Carlson, Joe Rogan.
5942000	5944000	And that video went huge.
5944000	5948000	And that was probably made during the darkest time.
5948000	5950000	It was summer of 2021.
5950000	5954000	And that was made out of things were pretty hopeless.
5954000	5958000	And I kind of just made that almost as like a shot in the dark.
5958000	5962000	I'm going to put everything I got into this video.
5962000	5968000	And I feel like you and Heather are also just beacons of light.
5968000	5972000	Almost like in Lord of the Rings when they lit those beacons on the mountains.
5972000	5976000	You know, you got to see another beacon and you get hopeful.
5976000	5978000	You know, you're not alone.
5978000	5986000	And so I know you guys have suffered a lot of demonetization and algorithms working against you.
5986000	5992000	But I know there are people like I talk to people all the time and I mentioned your name and they know who you are.
5992000	5998000	And so in the real world, people are very encouraged by you.
5998000	6001000	And you're maybe upsetting the right people.
6001000	6003000	I don't know.
6003000	6007000	I do take a certain amount of pleasure in upsetting the right people.
6007000	6009000	And it is one of my guideposts.
6009000	6012000	If you're upsetting the right people, you're probably doing something right.
6012000	6015000	So thank you. I appreciate that.
6015000	6022000	I would encourage you if you thought the last outbreak of tyranny was amazing,
6022000	6030000	then you're really going to enjoy what's going on in the World Health Organization
6030000	6035000	and their plan for a rematch.
6035000	6037000	It's really quite extraordinary.
6037000	6039000	Because I feel like they kind of lost the first battle.
6039000	6041000	They did.
6041000	6044000	And that keeps them up at night.
6044000	6051000	And they have decided that the solution is to rerun the last battle
6051000	6057000	and figure out what rules would have allowed them to silence the people who bested them.
6057000	6061000	So they are currently building exactly that set of rules.
6061000	6071000	And if we do nothing about it, it is likely to pass in May of this year.
6071000	6077000	Well, I think probably one of those big things that they would like to have changed
6077000	6082000	is that the last pandemic was just not that dangerous relatively.
6082000	6088000	Like if you compare it to previous plagues, you know, you had one third of Europe get wiped out
6088000	6095000	or the Spanish flu killed 50 to 100 million people.
6095000	6099000	You know, this was kind of like a fart in the wind compared to those.
6099000	6105000	Well, I have come to disbelieve the story of the Spanish flu.
6105000	6115000	It is well worth looking into the hypothesis that the Spanish flu was wildly exacerbated
6115000	6120000	by the abuse of the new wonder drug aspirin.
6120000	6122000	Really?
6122000	6124000	Yeah, it is terrifying.
6124000	6129000	But in the end, I think quite compelling argument.
6129000	6137000	The plague obviously was what it was, but obviously we are in a very different situation
6137000	6144000	with respect to our understanding of antibiotics and our understanding of hygiene
6144000	6150000	and our ability to prevent such things through other mechanisms.
6150000	6160000	I would say to the extent that you would imagine that a worse pathogen would be desirable to Goliath
6160000	6166000	if Goliath wanted to rerun the tape of history and beat us decisively this time.
6166000	6174000	And although it is not the World Health Organization, the EcoHealth Alliance,
6174000	6183000	which you may remember as the non-profit organization which spearheaded the research in Wuhan
6183000	6187000	that seems to have resulted in the production of SARS-CoV-2,
6187000	6199000	that same group headed by Peter Dasek, the same villain who kept doubling down on this ploy
6199000	6203000	and then pretending that a lab leak was impossible.
6203000	6211000	He and the EcoHealth Alliance have been granted something like $16 million, I think,
6211000	6226000	to set up a laboratory in Colorado to study the infection of bats from Asia with devastating human pathogens.
6226000	6231000	I wish I was making this up, but not only do they appear to want a rerun
6231000	6239000	with potentially new and more deadly pathogens, but they've hired the same people to produce them.
6240000	6242000	It's almost too obvious.
6242000	6244000	The definition of insanity.
6244000	6246000	It's the definition of insanity.
6246000	6258000	So that coupled with changes to the FCC regulations that would allow the FCC to control access to the internet
6259000	6271000	and changes to the WHO Pandemic Preparedness Plan all looks like somebody wants to be able to institute rules
6271000	6278000	on the entire human population based on anything that they can claim is a public health threat
6278000	6287000	and their ability to mandate would include the mandating of true vaccines, of gene therapy,
6287000	6297000	presumably including mRNA technology, and they also have reserved the right to censor any criticism
6297000	6304000	that would potentially upend their public health program.
6305000	6313000	So we're facing a rerun and we're not paying attention because most people are just sick of talking about the topic,
6313000	6322000	which I full well understand, but it would be a mistake to put it aside and ignore what those who lost round one are up to
6322000	6324000	so that they can win round two.
6326000	6328000	That's terrifying.
6328000	6333000	Do you think Elon Musk, do you think the reason why he's become like public enemy number one
6333000	6338000	is because he's kind of like this inconvenient wrench in their engine
6338000	6344000	that if they want to implement this mass censorship and control,
6344000	6348000	I think you were mentioning earlier, zero is a special number.
6348000	6352000	I really liked, I was listening to you mention that on the Dave Rubin report,
6352000	6360000	that if there is one platform that is free, that kind of negates all the other ones, right?
6360000	6367000	It forces them to free themselves because if there's only one free platform, everybody will be on it.
6367000	6374000	And so at a competitive level, if Elon Musk manages to truly free and stabilize Twitter,
6374000	6382000	then the other platforms will have to go along with that program or they will go extinct
6382000	6386000	because who's going to sign up for a platform where you can't speak openly?
6387000	6395000	Yeah, him buying Twitter is one of those events that I feel like if this was a war,
6395000	6399000	that would have been a big battle. That would have been a significant battle one.
6399000	6408000	Yeah, I agree. It's a huge factor and I hope Musk is up to the challenge.
6409000	6415000	I see evidence that he is interested in doing the right thing
6415000	6421000	and I see him make unforced errors that I can't explain.
6421000	6427000	So anyway, I'm hoping that he can figure out how to pull it off.
6428000	6436000	Yeah, I'm rooting for him. I think just yesterday he had a conversation with Alex Jones,
6436000	6443000	Andrew Tate, a couple other ones, Vivek Ramoswani.
6443000	6447000	It was quite an interesting, it was a Twitter space.
6447000	6455000	And to have these characters all in one area talking was really interesting.
6456000	6462000	Yep, I will say, okay, that is interesting.
6462000	6472000	But as I think I mentioned on the Dave Rubin report, Elon has me blocked.
6472000	6479000	That means I couldn't participate in the discussion around or even the poll that he took
6479000	6487000	on whether to bring Alex Jones back and I couldn't participate in that Twitter space.
6487000	6499000	And so I cannot understand this unless I just simply play no role in the free speech discussion.
6500000	6511000	It would seem that having made some personal decision to block me,
6511000	6514000	what am I supposed to say?
6514000	6520000	Yeah, I think it's really great that Elon Musk held a space with these people yesterday
6520000	6523000	when I can't even see that it's happening.
6523000	6533000	So, Elon, if you're watching, you have no idea how destructive it is of your platform
6533000	6536000	to block somebody yourself.
6536000	6540000	You are a large fraction of what's taking place on that platform.
6540000	6548000	And it isn't a minor fact when your account becomes invisible.
6548000	6553000	I have to infer even what's being discussed because I can't see it directly.
6553000	6555000	And I don't think that was your intent when you did it.
6555000	6561000	But please undo it because if you're really about free speech, this is not helping.
6561000	6565000	This means that every time somebody raises what you're doing with me,
6565000	6571000	I have to say I can't really embrace this because at the moment I can't even see it.
6571000	6572000	Right.
6572000	6576000	Like you said earlier, we got a band together.
6576000	6579000	We've got this big Goliath in front of us.
6579000	6581000	We've got to stick together.
6581000	6583000	There's not a ton of us.
6583000	6584000	Right.
6584000	6587000	There are very few and we're going to need to trust each other
6587000	6593000	and we're going to need to play well and we're going to need some luck.
6593000	6597000	We cannot afford friendly fire incidents.
6597000	6599000	So, let's get over it.
6599000	6600000	Yeah.
6600000	6607000	I mean, the one problem is the people that have been kind of ousted out of this establishment,
6607000	6610000	they are very independent minded people.
6610000	6615000	And it's probably going to be a little bit hard to rope them together.
6615000	6619000	You know, they're not as agreeable as the people that conform.
6619000	6620000	Yeah, they're lone wolves.
6620000	6626000	But you know, look, if this was a movie, we all get what has to happen, right?
6626000	6632000	You have all of these prickly characters who have found themselves facing the same enemy
6632000	6637000	and they have to learn to get along and yes, that's bound to be a little colorful,
6637000	6641000	but nonetheless, it's obvious that it has to happen.
6641000	6643000	So, let's do it.
6643000	6644000	Let's start practicing.
6644000	6648000	Let's be decent to each other and figure out how to function as a team
6648000	6652000	and laugh about the missteps.
6652000	6654000	You know, it's obvious.
6654000	6657000	All you need really is the right music playing for the soundtrack
6657000	6659000	and you'll know what you're supposed to do.
6659000	6662000	So, let's do it.
6662000	6664000	That's great.
6664000	6667000	I think I have one last question for you.
6667000	6669000	Then I'll let you go.
6669000	6672000	I really look up to you and Heather's relationship
6672000	6677000	as just kind of like something that I would strive to in my own relationship.
6677000	6681000	How do you have a successful long marriage?
6681000	6683000	Do you have any advice?
6683000	6691000	Yeah, I've got a ton of advice, but I have to be careful because
6691000	6698000	our situation is so unusual that, you know, because it's my life,
6698000	6705000	I can't really say how much of it is applicable to other people's situations,
6705000	6708000	but I would say things that have worked for us.
6708000	6715000	One, we got together quite early, which I used to think was an unfortunate fact.
6715000	6717000	I now don't think of it that way at all.
6717000	6720000	I now actually think it's an asset, a tremendous one,
6720000	6725000	because what it means is that you actually, you kind of grow up together
6725000	6732000	and so you come to understand the world in familiar terms
6732000	6740000	and you build up a kind of trust that is very powerful when things go crazy.
6740000	6744000	So there's that.
6744000	6753000	There is, I mean, there's really one thing above everything else
6753000	6757000	and every time I say it, somebody cringes.
6757000	6766000	You should not consider marrying anybody who doesn't have a sense of humor about themselves.
6766000	6770000	And the reason that people cringe when I say that is that it implies
6770000	6775000	that lots of people just really aren't an acceptable partner for marriage,
6775000	6777000	which is unfortunately true.
6777000	6780000	We should all be induced to have a sense of humor about ourselves
6780000	6783000	because frankly, we're all absurd.
6783000	6788000	I mean, you know, heck, we're apes
6788000	6793000	and we're walking around most of the time not thinking about that fact,
6793000	6797000	but it's nonetheless true and has profound implications for what we are
6797000	6799000	and how we behave and all that.
6799000	6807000	So I think the most useful thing is to recognize that your conscious mind
6807000	6812000	is not the same thing as you.
6812000	6815000	You should retain your conscious mind plus a whole bunch of other stuff
6815000	6817000	that you're not really in touch with.
6817000	6823000	And, you know, I frequently find myself in a situation where my defects
6823000	6829000	are getting in the road of something, you know, in our relationship.
6829000	6836000	For example, my chronic disorganization is disrupting Heather's desire
6836000	6841000	to have a house where stuff is where she can find it, for example.
6841000	6845000	And the funny thing is my conscious mind is on her side.
6845000	6850000	There's apparently some part of me that isn't, but it's not my conscious mind
6850000	6856000	and if she can see that actually it's not that I want to be a problem in this regard.
6856000	6861000	In fact, I would go well out of my way not to be if I could figure out how to pull it off.
6861000	6865000	That just removes the tension from the thing, right?
6865000	6869000	Then we're talking about why, you know, what developmental piece of my history
6869000	6872000	caused me not to be able to develop that skill.
6872000	6877000	That's a much better conversation to be having than why are you such a jerk
6877000	6882000	who doesn't care whether I can live in our house, right?
6882000	6888000	So having a sense of humor about yourself, recognizing that we are,
6888000	6892000	every one of us is a mystery even to ourselves
6892000	6896000	and that your partnership with somebody
6896000	6901000	involves you being partnered with the part that you and they understand
6901000	6904000	and the part that neither of you understands
6904000	6908000	and that's a funny scenario to be trapped in
6908000	6912000	and you better know how to laugh about it.
6912000	6920000	That's great advice and I think it's so nice that you and Heather do this podcast together
6920000	6924000	because there's a lot of people out there who are just like these talking heads
6924000	6928000	who have these strong opinions online but when you see somebody next to their wife
6928000	6933000	you kind of look at them differently like, oh wow, somebody can really tolerate this person
6933000	6941000	through thick and thin and I recently saw Jordan Peterson a couple of times live
6941000	6945000	and it's really nice he comes out there or his wife introduces him
6945000	6949000	and she's super sweet and he's kind of like this.
6949000	6955000	He has many different sides but it's nice to see him getting the questions from his wife.
6955000	6959000	You see him in a different light than when you typically see him on those debate stages
6959000	6963000	when he's kind of, there's about a million videos on YouTube saying
6963000	6970000	Jordan Peterson destroys this feminist or Jordan Peterson destroys this woke kid
6970000	6974000	and then it's nice to see him in this pleasant dynamic with a woman
6974000	6980000	so yeah, I just recently worked with Jordan Peterson's wife on a project
6980000	6984000	and it was very pleasant.
6984000	6991000	Well I think you're exactly right to focus on this and I think the problem is
6991000	7001000	it's surprisingly easy to show a false side to the world.
7002000	7009000	So lots of people do it and when you do see somebody with their spouse
7009000	7014000	and the spouse is not quietly sitting there not saying anything
7014000	7017000	but you're seeing them interact or even better you're seeing them disagree
7017000	7020000	maybe even over something important, right?
7020000	7025000	Then, well how exactly would you fake that?
7026000	7030000	And I do believe you don't see everything on the podcast
7030000	7034000	but what you see is absolutely accurate.
7034000	7041000	That is how we are and you know, I would say the same thing is true
7041000	7045000	if you saw us with our kids, is it perfect?
7045000	7052000	No, but you would see there's no tension around things, right?
7052000	7057000	There are all the flawed human beings that we are but we genuinely love each other
7057000	7061000	and appreciate each other and are frustrated by each other
7061000	7065000	and find some of each other's jokes funny and not other ones
7065000	7070000	and anyway, the point is the difficulty of faking a persona
7070000	7079000	is a thousandth of what it would be to fake a family.
7080000	7085000	Even more so, our cats don't show up on the podcast very much anymore
7085000	7091000	but bad people can have a relationship with their dog
7091000	7097000	but cats, if your cat likes you, if your cat is jumping up on your podcast desk
7097000	7101000	to have you pet it or sitting in your lap, right?
7101000	7106000	That suggests that this animal isn't afraid of you, that it appreciates you
7106000	7111000	and it also tells you something about what things are like when the camera is not on.
7111000	7114000	So anyway, I think all of those indicators are amazingly powerful.
7114000	7120000	I have seen the same thing between Jordan Peterson and Tammy.
7120000	7128000	I recently met Tucker Carlson's wife and one of his daughters, same thing, right?
7128000	7133000	You just see people who really appreciate each other and aren't hiding anything
7133000	7138000	and it really does tell you that they're for real.
7138000	7141000	Did you do anything with Tucker?
7141000	7142000	Yeah.
7142000	7144000	Oh, has that already out?
7144000	7145000	No.
7145000	7147000	Oh, well, I'm excited for that.
7147000	7148000	Yeah, me too.
7148000	7150000	Is that going to be on his Twitter show?
7150000	7151000	I don't know.
7152000	7155000	Yeah, I've been really enjoying seeing you make the rounds.
7155000	7162000	I saw you on the Patrick Bet David show, the Russell Brand, Dave Rubin, so...
7162000	7165000	It sort of reminds me of the old days.
7165000	7171000	It used to be that there was an awful lot of traveling and sitting in person with people,
7171000	7174000	which I really appreciated for some reason.
7174000	7177000	It's more meaningful than the other stuff.
7177000	7184000	Obviously, I now live on an island, so I see people through the screen more often than not.
7184000	7189000	But COVID killed all of the sitting face-to-face with people
7189000	7193000	and having conversations that others wanted to listen to that way.
7193000	7198000	And it got us all used to doing a better job with Zoom or its equivalent.
7198000	7203000	But I miss the in-person stuff and the fact that it's coming back
7203000	7207000	and that I have found myself in all those places that you mentioned.
7207000	7210000	I think that's a good sign and I hope it holds out.
7210000	7213000	I think it's important to sit with people.
7213000	7220000	Again, it's a lot harder to fake things when you're actually sitting face-to-face
7220000	7225000	than you just have to keep it together while the camera's on.
7225000	7227000	Yeah, I totally agree.
7227000	7232000	Well, I'm just getting myself into this podcast arena.
7232000	7239000	And I figure the unique thing that I can add to this is the visual aspect.
7239000	7242000	100%. I love your animations.
7242000	7243000	Thank you.
7243000	7244000	Thank you.
7244000	7247000	So as of right now, I'm thinking I'll conduct a podcast
7247000	7250000	and then extract the clips, animate over those,
7250000	7253000	and then if people want to see more, they can go to the podcast later.
7253000	7254000	That's cool.
7254000	7255000	But if they'll work together.
7255000	7257000	I think that's going to work.
7257000	7259000	Because there's about a million podcasts
7259000	7262000	and just about everybody you meet now has a podcast.
7262000	7266000	And so I didn't want to just make another brick in the wall.
7266000	7267000	Yep.
7267000	7271000	But anyways, I'll end the recording here.
