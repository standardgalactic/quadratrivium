0	14040	Hi, Jamie. Welcome. Good to be here, Mark. Yeah, so I've recently discovered your talks
14040	17800	and lectures and I haven't read your books yet, but what I've seen thus far has been
17800	21840	awesome. Daniel Schmockdenberger referred me and said I have to talk to you. So I'm
21840	26840	really excited to talk to you today. Yeah, happy to dive in. I mean, just getting to
26840	32320	check out some of your beautiful drawing and animations on YouTube. It seems like you're
32320	37520	barking up a number of very diverse and eclectic trees, but there is that kind of theme of
37520	43040	sort of just better understanding, you know, the human condition, our past and our future.
43040	47640	So, you know, obviously happy to jump in on all those things. Yes, I think that you and
47640	53240	I are very aligned on what we're interested in, like from existential crisis to meaning
53240	58120	to psychedelics and everything in between. So I'm really excited to just see where this
58120	64280	conversation goes. For sure. So I thought we could start by just, you could introduce
64280	71800	yourself to the audience. Sure. So my name is Jamie Wheel, and I am the founding executive
71800	78360	director of the Flow Genome Project, which is an organization dedicated to the research
78360	84040	and training of peak performance and leadership, and so sort of combination of neuroscience,
84040	88160	anthropology, optimal psychology, and then, you know, quite often adventure leadership
88160	92880	fun things to do in the wild and backcountry and mountains and oceans. And we get to work
92880	96760	with everybody from, you know, executives at companies like Google and Deloitte and
96760	101600	Disney and Lululemon and places like that, but also privileged to work with some of the
101600	107400	tier one special operations community in the world, the SAS and Santos Military Academy
107440	114160	in the UK, as well as SEAL Team 6 and Dev Group here in the US, and really always just
114160	121080	curious about what makes us come alive, what lets us feel and perform at our best. And
121080	124680	then fundamentally kind of almost back to the old school Greeks, you know, what is a
124680	130720	good life well lived. And that inquiry has also led to me writing a couple of books.
130720	135800	One was called Stealing Fire, and that was really trying to sort of trace and track the
135800	141360	multi-thousand year history of ecstatic cultures, like those communities of practice that have
141360	146640	sought and made the most of non-ordinary states of being. And again, that goes all the way
146640	152760	back to one of Socrates' senior students stealing the psychedelic brew from the Lucidian
152760	157480	Mysteries and throwing a house party in Athens, which was kind of a wonderfully weird and
157480	163880	funny story, risking life and banishment, you know, to do so, all the way to contemporary
163920	169600	expressions like Burning Man and other situations. And then most recently, I wrote a book called
169600	176040	Recapture the Rapture, Rethinking God, Sex and Death in a World that's Lost its Mind.
176040	181080	And really that one is just to say, hey, where are we going as a civilization? Feels like
181080	186640	we're in kind of a tight spot. Seems like we're going to need to get much better at
186640	192440	processing our grief at skillful and responsible accessing of peak states and connecting to
192440	199040	each other in resilient, anti-fragile ways that don't end up in the ditch of dysfunctional
199040	205200	or cultic communities. So how do we do this thing is fundamentally the ongoing inquiry?
205200	210400	And what are some ways to have, you know, to have as meaningful and purposeful and healthy
210400	213800	and happy and joyful lives as we can along the way?
213800	218840	Oh, that's all brilliant. And I'm excited to dive deep. But first, I think I need to
218920	224280	stop you and have you tell that story about the Illusinian Mysteries. Oh, I've been really
224280	230080	fascinated with that whole ritual, the psychedelic brew. And so somebody stole the brew?
230080	237120	Yeah, it's such a crazy story. And I actually shared it with a friend, Brian Marorescu,
237120	241160	who wrote the immortality which kind of right, which blew up and expanded the story,
241160	245800	which was fundamentally, I mean, Brian, Brian's new contribution is the, what does he call it,
245800	250280	the archaeochemistry or something, but basically actually the fine grain scraping of the pots
250280	254320	and things to see what was actually in them versus just the written record. But he was
254320	262720	really just dusting off Ruck and Wasson's thesis from way back in the day about the potential
262720	270960	LSA, you know, ergot fungus as the actual psychoactive kicker in the Greek Illusinian Mysteries.
270960	275280	But what's so interesting about the Illusinian Mysteries is they persisted for 2000 years.
275920	281080	You know, you're like, holy shit, like what cultural anything continues for 2000 years. And
281080	286000	here's one of the wilder and woollier state experiences. And this is Plutarch and Cicero
286000	290400	and Plato and arguably all the way back to Pythagoras and the Presocratics, like there was
290400	298040	some serious juju coming out of this over a week long ritual with sleep deprivation and chanting
298040	303640	and pageantry and costumes and all these other kind of state shifting technologies. But then
303680	311920	also Kukion, this arguably quite credibly psychoactive brew. And if you were an initiate
311920	318680	into the mysteries, you weren't allowed to share it or talk about it on pain of death. And so
318680	324760	about 20 years ago, I was doing research and I just remember this random little snippet of an
324760	332800	account from sort of Plato's era of a court case about someone having stolen the Kukion and
333680	338400	then making use of it. And so in the writing of Stealing Fire, I was like, oh, I remember that.
338400	341760	I've got to get back to that, dust it off, see what it was. The story was actually even better
341760	350240	than I remembered. It turned out it was Alcibiades, who was this like rascal of a senior student of
350240	355240	Socrates and potentially they were lovers. So he was kind of his like chicken boy, you know,
355400	361720	slash like like sketchy sketchy sketchy teacher student relationships. But Alcibiades himself
361720	369400	was a rascal. He then steals it. He ends up throwing a huge house party with the magic potion. So
369400	373880	this is not that different than like Silicon Valley billionaires going to Burning Man, you know,
373880	379320	and blowing the roof off the thing, he then gets ratted out by some rivals. And he ends up then
379320	384200	betraying Athens. He's like this crazy double crosser, all sorts of things. He ends up actually,
384200	390200	I just read two weeks ago, I think he ends up getting murdered in the end. But like his story
390200	396040	is absolutely off the chart. So that idea that, you know, we often think of ancient things as very
396040	400600	kind of stuffy and respectable, you know, and buttoned down. And that was the way they did
400600	404200	things back in the past. And if we want to be respectable, we should do things more like they
404200	409800	did not how we do now. And then you kind of realize this was almost identical. And it was literally
409800	417400	like it was was it 22,000 or 2,500, whatever it was, it was almost to the day, an anniversary of
417400	426200	when Ken Kesey was at Stanford University, unbeknowingly, taking MK Ultra, you know, the government
426200	433160	psyops projects, taking their LSD as part of a medical study and stealing it out of the cabinets
433160	438840	and taking it back to Stanford and lighting up all of the, you know, this was Larry McMurtry,
438840	444680	the writer, this was where at Abbey Wallace Stegner, you know, all these like literary giants
444680	450680	were there and they were literally like early 60s, getting lit up with exactly the same process,
450680	457320	stealing fire, right, stealing the psychedelic magic. And then that booted up and turned on
457320	461320	everything from the Grateful Dead is their house band, they were just a bunch of funky
461320	466360	musicians in Palo Alto at the time, they pioneered psychedelic rock, which is now happening at the
466360	471720	Sphere in Las Vegas with John Mayer, taking Jerry Garcia's place, you know, one of the largest
471720	479480	grossing acts to this day over the last five years is still that lineage, as is all the Silicon
479480	485560	Valley from the Homebrew Computer Club, all the way to the imaginings of AR and VR, all the way
485560	492760	into the entire Burning Man culture and community, goes back to Ken Kesey stealing that government
492760	499720	asset and throwing a house party. So the parallels are just, you know, you couldn't make up. And I
499720	505480	think they are, they are fascinating because there's always that question of, can you bottle
505480	511960	lightning without getting burned? You know, is there something that is tricksy? Is there something
511960	518600	squirrely? Is there something inherently unstable and therefore kind of not scalable, right, about
518600	527240	these experiences and also about the utterly predictable backlashes that they almost always
527240	533240	seem to precipitate? And even just last week, right, we had the maps, FDA clinical trials,
533240	538520	getting the hard breaks and the committee voting 10 to 1 against approving it because there's been
538520	545480	a lot more scrutiny and a lot more attention. This was a MDMA, right? This was for the MDMA
545720	553240	trial. This is a 40 year effort. And it's right there at the goal line. And potentially getting
559080	562920	and potentially getting sidelined. And Jesus, I'm going to grab a drink.
562920	574360	Yeah, yeah, yeah, no problem.
574360	593080	All good. You are on fire right now. I am loving the pace of this podcast.
593720	600200	Oh, great. Yeah, great, great. This is just me on normal settings. So we can play however you want.
600280	608520	So the MDMA studies. So the MDMA studies and the FDA's oversight committee basically had to
609080	612760	sift through, there was a petition and a kind of a complaint that, hey, things were a little fast
612760	616520	and loose here with this, with this, you know, taking this drug to market and moving through all
616520	622440	the phases of the trials. And one of the comments really struck me, which was one of the most
622440	629080	significant concerns was, hey, by the way, we've heard that this MDMA, one of the known side effects
629080	637960	is euphoria. And that's concerning, because euphoria means it has a high potential for abuse.
639320	645640	And you think now, wait a second, this is the same FDA that Greenlit, Adderall and Ritalin,
645640	651160	basically we've had, you know, and just in the last 18 months even, there's been a
651160	656520	published report being like, oh yeah, by the way, all you parents that were talked into
656520	662360	putting your little developmental kids on amphetamines for their adolescence and
662360	665880	neurological development, there is no correlation between them, between that,
666520	670600	and them doing any better in academic outcomes. They just kind of slipped that one into the
670600	677320	news cycle like, sorry, kids, 30, 30 years of creating little speed freaks. And it wasn't even
677320	683160	going to help them get into college. Right. So we did that. We did Celebrex, which turned out
683160	688360	to be a huge, the largest settlement, class action settlement on killing people with a drug.
688360	691720	What was Celebrex? We definitely did put in. What is Celebrex?
692840	696920	Well, gosh, now I'm gonna, let me think, it might even be worth doing. Celebrex sounds familiar.
696920	706040	So Celebrex, it might, what is the largest pharma settlement? It could be another one of those.
706360	712680	It says Celebrex is used to treat pain and redness, swelling and heat inflammation.
715000	721640	Oh, Vioxx. Vioxx. Right. We did Vioxx. We definitely did oxycontin,
722600	730920	you know, and all of those drugs made it just fine through the process. But we are having real
730920	738040	issues and hyperscrutinizing, one that also has euphoria. And HL Makin was that famous kind of
738040	745560	very funny newspaper publisher back in the early 20th century. I think he said Protestantism,
745560	749800	you know, and he said the definition of Protestantism is that sneaking suspicion
749800	757640	that somebody somewhere is having a good time. Right. And so you can see like all the way back to
757640	762280	Alcibiades back in ancient Greece and being taken to task for outing the mysteries, which,
762280	767560	you know, fair cop, those were the road rules. Right. But nonetheless, it was fun enough, whatever
767560	773320	that experience was, it was fun enough. He wanted to steal the magic brew for a house party
774280	780280	all the way to Keezy in the early 60s at Stanford, unwittingly interacting with MKUltra,
780280	787400	the Mind Control Government Project that Stranger Things is based on. Right. All the way to our
787400	795320	current situation where we have MDA running up against FDA concerns about they might be having
795320	801720	a little too much fun and we need to put those extra extra screws to them. So for me, that's
801720	807880	you can boil it almost down to so what is that dynamic through through the ages is the sort of
808680	815960	ongoing battle between the priests and the Prometheans. You know, there's always the priest
816040	821800	class and they start out, you know, wearing black cassocks. Now they're the shiny men in
821800	826920	black, the feds. Right. But it's still those in control of the status quo and the norms
827640	833080	who are empowered to police consciousness. And then the honest to God Prometheans. Right. I mean,
833080	839720	all the way back to the ancient myth. Prometheus is like, Hey, Daddy Zeus. It seems like there's a
839720	843720	bunch of cold, starving, shivering little monkeys down there and I'm taking pity on them. Can we
843720	849160	help them out? And Zeus is like, hell no. If we did, they'd get too epiti for their own good.
849880	853000	Right. And Prometheus is like, all right, well, I'm going to do this anyway. My heart bleeds for
853000	857160	them. Right. He's kind of an, he's almost like a Hellenic Christ figure. Right. And he's like,
857160	861320	okay, so I'm going to do this on behalf of them. And he doesn't just bring them fire. He brings
861320	868360	them civilization, technology, pottery, language, medicine, all of it. Right. And then there's
868360	875160	hell to pay. Right. And so we see that that oscillating dynamic that the Prometheans find the juice
875960	879720	wherever it is, wherever it's been buried, wherever it's been hidden, wherever it's been locked up,
880360	886440	they free it. And there's almost always these explosive renaissance is right celebrations,
886440	892360	rocking good parties. And then that starts giving you know, then other people start finding out
892360	900280	about it, it draws attention, and then invariably gets shut down. And the real tell is the extreme
900280	905720	prejudice with which it gets shut down. You know, it's not, hey, guys, cool it off. You know,
905720	911000	turn down the music by 11, you know, make sure you clean up when you're done. It is like literally the
911000	919320	most aggressive and violent reactive repression you could possibly imagine. And so it seems like,
919320	923640	yeah, that, that, that ain't shell making quote, that idea of that, you know, the sneaking suspicion
923640	929640	that somebody somewhere is having a good time. Right. And even last year with when Burning Man
929640	936760	got, you know, rained out. And it was, I think, arguably the first year of that event, where
937480	943880	the people at just because of enough starlings on site, right, there was a it became the first
943880	949000	extremely online burn in history. Because in the past, you used to schlep it out to the desert,
949000	952600	you were completely unplugged and out of touch for, you know, a week to two weeks,
952600	955880	depending on how long you were there. And you were out of contact with all civilization,
955880	960520	that was part of the magic and the mystery of it. This was an extremely online burn.
961080	964360	And you had all the haters, and you had the New York Post, and you had crazy TikTokers,
964360	969480	and you had right alt right wing nuts on Telegram talking about how this was a federal,
969480	973400	this was Operation Mockingbird or whatever, you know, and then they were going to inject everybody
973400	977320	with Ebola, you had people weighing in like that, you had people being like, Oh, look,
977320	982040	there's Chris Rock and, you know, and, and, and, and Tiesto, and here's the cool DJs. And,
982040	987080	and then you had people at Burning Man also reading these things, and then also commenting.
987640	994760	And, and the amount of psychic energy that was devoted to making sense of what was a few rainy
994760	1003320	days was completely out of proportion with that and being a NASCAR race, or a football stadium,
1003880	1008920	or, you know, a stamp collector's convention or anything. And so it is, I think, super interesting
1009960	1016120	that how we hold notions of bliss, pleasure, joy, liberation,
1017560	1028120	directly affect our, our willingness, our tolerance, our curiosity, and our positioning,
1028120	1034920	because radical, whatever, you know, radical joy, radical awareness, radical freedom,
1034920	1042600	is rarely in a vacuum and rarely without other people having strong opinions
1044040	1049480	about how it can and should go down. Wow, I love everything you just said. I have
1049480	1053320	quite a few thoughts. My first thing is I don't want to make this about me, but
1053880	1059160	at Burning Man, Brian Morescu went there and people were very inspired by the video we made
1059160	1065000	together on the Elusinian Mysteries and the, the great psychedelic secret and that whole ritual.
1065000	1071000	So they built an entire section of Burning Man based on the idea that if you die before you die,
1071000	1077320	you don't die. And that was written on this giant cup. It was massive. That was the Kukion cup.
1078120	1083560	And they took, I don't know, like 10,000 drones and they put them up in the sky and they programmed
1083560	1091640	them to create the images that I had drawn in our video, which just blew my mind, blew my mind.
1091640	1099800	This was funded by the musk family. It was Kimble and Christiana. Right. Yeah. I don't know them,
1099800	1105560	but I was just, when I saw the pictures of the drones making this DNA tree that I love to draw,
1105560	1111240	I was like, that's insane. So that's one thing you reminded me of, which I think is really cool
1111240	1116600	how this, this secret of the Elusinian Mysteries, it still lives on and it, and it's like, it still
1116600	1123160	captivates us, you know? And then one thing you made me think of is like, can humans handle
1123720	1129720	these very potent, powerful substances without these ancient rituals attached to them? Like,
1129720	1135080	it seems like if you just take all the barriers down and you just give people these really powerful
1135080	1140840	agents, sometimes they can't handle them and you look at cities that have made all drugs legal
1141480	1146360	and it kind of didn't work in some ways, you know? You can't give people ultimate freedom
1146360	1153640	without accountability. Are you seeing that? Yeah, but I think to quote the great philosopher,
1153640	1160280	Homer Simpson, you know, he was like short answer, yes with an and long answer, no with a but,
1160280	1165400	you know, I mean, the bottom line, I mean, there's a couple of things. If you're referring
1165400	1171480	specifically to current U.S. cities efforts like Portland and Oregon and those kind of things and
1171480	1176920	even Vancouver and those sort of things to decriminalize drugs, you could also potentially
1176920	1183480	look to Portugal and a few other places in the world, you know, I think it's essential to differentiate
1183480	1189240	or disambiguate between different classes of chemicals because they are radically different
1189240	1196440	in their in both impact, user experience, pro-social white indoor health benefits or detriments.
1197320	1202920	So the fact that folks were trying to do that, especially in North America, you know, in the
1202920	1210200	last decade and quite and in the midst of both a quarantine lockdown crisis of public and mental
1210200	1217480	and social health, as well as an opioid, you know, starting with oxy, going into street heroin,
1217480	1224680	going into fentanyl, you're like, okay, those are not, that's not a cognitive liberty argument.
1225560	1230040	And in fact, I was on stage speaking of Benningman, I was giving a talk at MAPS
1230840	1235160	with Rick Doblin and Carl, gosh, what is Carl's last name?
1237880	1242920	Hart? Carl Hart. Yes. Carl Hart, right? Who is who is that? I believe he's at Columbia.
1243640	1251400	And he is a very strong cognitive libertarian, basically the idea that people should be free
1251400	1256840	to consume anything they'd like. He's also quite infamously, as he, you know, wrote in his own
1256840	1263640	books, a high functioning opioid user. So, you know, the thing there is like, you can, you know,
1263640	1268120	motivated reasoning, you know, there is an element where he's like, of course, you're going to argue
1268120	1273800	to be left alone to do the thing that you like to do, and may or may not be able to, you know,
1273800	1286680	stop or start at will, right? But the urban situations does lead you to question how safe,
1287480	1295000	stable, prosocial are accessed to these tools and techniques. I've written in like my last book,
1295720	1300600	a suggested model of social psychedelic use, which would be a bell curve. And basically,
1300600	1306840	10% of the population, those with family histories of Doctriad personality, so narcissism,
1306840	1313240	Machiavellianism, sociopathy, authoritarianism, schizophrenia, you know, borderline personality,
1313240	1318280	any number of situations where like, hey, your medical and or family history does not suggest
1318280	1323560	this is a good role of the dice, so don't, right? That 10%, take those folks out.
1325480	1332840	Only 10% of the population should probably ever do them more than one, two or three times in their
1332840	1337640	entire life. And those could be sort of the psychonauts, test pilots, the cultural creators,
1337640	1341560	whatever those people are that self select and are willing to kind of learn and apprentice to the
1341560	1347560	skill sets. And then, you know, the overwhelming majority in the middle, what would it look like
1347560	1352200	to do what you suggested, which is reintegrate these state experiences within a initiatory
1352200	1357560	culture of ritual framework, aka the anthropology, the neuro anthropology of it. And you can make
1357560	1364680	a case then if you're like, okay, well, how have civilizations, how have societies made use of
1365720	1371640	hardship or deal, initiation and access to transcendence, vision quest, rights of passage,
1371640	1374760	all those kind of things. So you can make a case, hey, first one kind of makes sense.
1375480	1381720	And the right of passage from adolescence to adulthood, right, that that great, very famous
1381720	1386920	book by Alex Haley that then became I think the most watched mini series ever roots, right,
1386920	1391080	which was about the African diaspora and the slave trade. But back in Ghana, I think it was,
1391880	1396040	you know, Kuntakinte is the lead, you know, he's the kind of the hero that makes his way
1396040	1401880	through the story. But as a baby, he is born in West Africa, and his father holds them up to
1401880	1408360	this incredible Milky Way night sky. And he says, behold, Kuntakinte, the only thing in the universe
1408360	1414760	greater than you. Right. And it's this beautiful, like, like, welcome to the world kind of moment.
1414760	1419560	And here's your place in things. Here's your place against the vast and the infinite, the Milky Way,
1419560	1424440	the night sky, here's your place in your family, here's your place in your community. And so
1424440	1429960	picturing that, you know, fast forward 15 years, picturing that as our initiation for young men
1429960	1435880	and young women into adulthood, because right now we've got failure to launch, we've got kids
1435960	1441880	kicking the can down the road on an extended adolescence, right, until they're 30, which is,
1441880	1446680	I think, arguably, a little too long. You know, it's like, I'm just going to smoke weed and jerk
1446680	1450920	off to porn and play first person shooter games in my parents' basement, and then become an angry
1450920	1455640	incel, you know, because I don't have a snatched jawline like all the chads who are snagging all
1455640	1462120	the stasis, you're like, that's wildly dysfunctional. You know, and so what we need, you need
1462120	1467160	moments of effective initiation that actually are transformational. They're not as Michael
1467160	1473480	Pollan called them placebo sacraments, right, you actually need the real deal, so that if I pass
1473480	1481080	through that threshold, I am no longer the same person, my relationship and obligation to the
1481080	1485080	world is not the same. So authentic initiatory rites of passage, and you know, folks have been
1485080	1489000	talking about that, that's not a particularly profound insight, it's just pronounced on how
1489000	1495480	absent they are. And the next one could arguably be marriage, right, so picture, you know, and if
1495480	1499720	you wanted to get really down into the details and programming, right, you could be like, oh,
1499720	1505240	that initiatory rite of passage could be three grams of psilocybin, or it could be a functional
1505240	1511400	ayahuasca experience or something along those lines, right, slow enough, not acutely intense enough
1511400	1516680	to just scramble you, you know, like DMT or like five MEO or something like something along those
1516680	1521640	lines, but you know, a real, you know, like the world's enchanted and magical, you know, and I'm
1521640	1528600	being and seeing that, right, so that is an initiatory process. For partners and couples, and you
1528600	1534440	know, maps has been parallel tracking this, which is MDMA as couples therapy. So imagine if, you
1534440	1538200	know, instead of sort of sitting with your rabbi or sitting with your priest or whoever the sort of
1538200	1543400	minister of your ceremony would be beforehand as a young couple, you know, like a happy couple to
1543400	1547560	be, what are you guys going to do? What are your commitments? What are your obligations? What might
1547560	1555480	it be like for them to take MDMA together? And with some form of guidance or facilitation, right,
1555480	1559800	it could just simply be loving friends and family, it could be a minister, it could be whatever, to
1559800	1566040	actually speak their deepest hopes and fears for and their pledging of their love for each other
1566760	1573480	in a way that marriage then became that communion, not simply, oh, we got a Williams and Sonoma
1573480	1577400	guest list and please make sure we get enough linens to match our silverware, you know, and there
1577400	1582280	we are, you know, doing our destination wedding for the gram, you know, like all of these super
1582280	1588280	hyper superficial things that don't carry you through the doldrums, don't carry you through the,
1588280	1591720	we've got two kids under the age of three and we've been sleepless for six months and I, you
1591720	1595720	know, and I don't even know who I am anymore, let alone who you are anymore, and this doesn't
1595720	1602920	feel fun anymore, you know, and couples just drifting under the burden of being householders
1602920	1608200	together, which is, you know, which is an unmitigated son of a bitch, if you don't have, you know,
1608200	1614040	the other things that come with deep connection and potential communion. And then the obvious final
1614040	1621000	one is just end of life. What might it mean, there I am, you know, sliding off this mortal coil
1621640	1627480	and really whatever, you know, I mean, there's so many stories of either staunch atheists who then
1627480	1633640	get religion at the end, you know, or devout believers who then doubt everything or whatever it
1633640	1641000	might be, but basically facing the reaper is a great equalizer on whatever worldviews or philosophies
1641000	1646680	you played through, you know, the rest of your life with and an experience like, and again, this is
1646680	1654040	all wildly open to interpretation and curation, but you know, an experience like 5MDMT, which many
1654600	1661720	participants do report is as close as anyone can imagine to a near death experience of sort of,
1661720	1667160	you know, brilliant white light encounter with source consciousness, you're like, oh, okay,
1667160	1673320	many people who have had that experience prior to dying, go out of their way to mention, I'm no
1673320	1677960	longer so afraid of my physical death. I know what's on the other side, I've had a quick sneak peek
1677960	1685880	preview. And so imagine that and not just by itself, like, oh, let's just get grandpa loaded to, you
1685880	1690760	know, and put him in front of some, you know, immersive VR and see what happens, but much more
1690760	1696920	like, hey, grandma grandpa, here is this sacred experience, you get to peek around the corner
1697400	1703800	of where your path is going soon. And then you get to come back and now, potentially with guided
1704440	1710200	therapy with, you know, again, family facilitation, what is it that you'd like to share? What are the
1710200	1714520	places to make amends? What are the truths you want to pass on to your grandchildren? What are the
1714520	1719480	heartfelt things you want to share with your own kids? You know, and so we could really reintegrate
1720600	1726840	disassociated teens and bring them across the threshold into adulthood, partnership in union,
1727400	1733000	which, you know, you don't have to be a sort of card carrying conservative to just acknowledge
1733000	1740360	that, hey, as parents come together to make more children and further our nation, our communities,
1740360	1746600	our species, having them be happy and connected is generally a better thing than having them
1746600	1752680	alienated and fragmented. And then end of life. I mean, you know, and Baby Boomers have kind of
1752680	1758440	led the way every, every stage of their own development, you know, the famous kind of me
1758440	1761480	generation, you know, when they were young, they were all about personal growth and development
1761480	1764200	and transcendence. And then they were in their middle years, and they were all about making
1764200	1768440	bank and, you know, money and kind of Wall Street greed is good kind of thing. And now they're
1768440	1775240	shuffling off the coil. So there's naturally, this is a great time to revisit our end of life
1775240	1781480	rituals and ceremonies. And compared to, hey, grandma or grandpa, we found them off to a nursing
1781480	1785800	home five years ago, because it just got too difficult, you know, and now we are paying
1785800	1790680	exorbitant amounts of money to these companies who hire minimum wage employees who dope grandma
1790680	1796520	grandpa to the gills, you know, on sedatives, you know, whatever it is to keep them docile and
1796520	1802440	manageable. And they die, you know, and we maybe we guiltily, you know, obligingly show up around
1802440	1808520	their bed when it's when the time is getting really close, but they're often out of it. And
1808520	1812280	they die under fluorescent lights, hooked up to tubes, and you're like, Oh my God,
1812920	1818680	like we can do so much better than that. Just from a heartfelt human sense, but also even just from
1818680	1826280	sort of clinical and therapeutic outcomes sense. So that to me, would be a really meaningful
1827240	1833960	wrapper that culturally and interrelationally and communally, we sort of can and ought
1834760	1840760	to include in these peak states and experiences because the downside of the maps medicalization
1840760	1844920	model, which was a very strategic tactical thing, which is like, let's make this respectable,
1844920	1848440	let's make this legit, let's go through all the proper channels and let's speak in the language
1848440	1852760	of mainstream dominant society. So they actually understand and can validate what we believe is
1852760	1858920	to be true and precious about these experiences, aka PTSD, depression, smoking, smoking cessation,
1858920	1864280	anxiety, right? All the, all the kitchen sink stuff that has been laid at the feet of the
1864280	1869480	psychedelic experience, and instead be like, look, guys, those, those are epiphenomena.
1870200	1876200	You know, those are little bells and whistles that may or may not be improved by an encounter
1876200	1881080	with the numinous. But can we actually just sort of let the mystery stay the mystery? Can we actually
1881080	1888840	just say, Hey, these experiences seem to somewhat reliably gain us access to non ordinary states
1888840	1894840	of being where there is a certain sacredness, suchness, magic, mystery, you know, insight,
1894840	1899720	delight, aesthetic appreciation, you know, take your pick as to which of those things, you know,
1899720	1907560	you want to hang your hat on and then just say, Hey, we can't and we shouldn't try and pin that down
1908200	1915080	to the 17th decimal place. That kills it. You know, and it reminds me of that. There's an old
1915080	1918760	joke. I think I think Mark Twain used to tell it, but like the web, like probably not because this
1918760	1925560	is too, too recent a story that the plot is there's a biologist checking to see how far frogs, frogs
1925560	1929320	can jump and he gives them different commands. And he's like, Oh, a frog, you know, a frog,
1929320	1933160	when given the command to jump will jump 10 centimeters. And then he takes an exacto knife,
1933160	1936520	you know, a little scalpel, lops off one leg. And he's like, And then when I gave the frog
1936520	1940680	another command to jump, yeah, he only jumped seven and a half centimeters. And then I chopped off
1940680	1944360	another leg and gave him the command to jump. And he only jumped five centimeters. And then,
1944360	1947880	you know, I cut off his final leg and gave him the command to jump and nothing happened.
1947880	1954920	So I now conclude that a frog with no legs is deaf. And you do and you kind of think that's
1954920	1963160	sort of how our, you know, again, big pharma double blind placebo controlled DSM five correlate
1963960	1968600	psychedelic research is, you're just like, Do you guys know even what you're looking at?
1968600	1973320	Or are you all pretending that there is not this magical mystical
1973320	1978680	initiatory experience behind those doors? And we're just sort of all sort of that that's,
1978680	1986200	that's the, in some respects, that's the, that's the scam is we're all pretending that there's
1986200	1991160	no magic and mystery there. And if we all stay on that hymn book of like incongenity,
1991160	1996040	such and such, such and such in conjunction with clinical therapy, you know, is going to result
1996040	2000120	in all of these outcomes, but it's a little like that, you know, Hunter Thompson's fear and loathing
2000120	2004520	in Las Vegas, you know, like, you know, we were somewhere outside of Boston when the drugs began
2004520	2007800	to kick in, right? And then famously, they're driving along that Cadillac and then they pick
2007800	2011960	up the hitchhiker, you know, and Hunter's peaking. And he's like, When are we going to tell him
2011960	2016680	about the bats? You know, don't worry, the poor bastard will see him soon enough himself, you
2016680	2024360	know, and you kind of think that to me, that's, that's the shadow side of the conventional
2024440	2031000	pharmacological medicalization and VC corporate, you know, experience of this quote on quote,
2031000	2037320	psychedelic red renaissance is we're going to get Prozac Nation 2.0 with new and improved
2037320	2045720	five HT 2a receptor sites, you know, versus anything, but I mean, just imagine if 30 years
2045720	2052440	ago we'd gone down the religious liberty route and had said, Hey, placebo sacraments suck,
2053160	2061800	you know, and we as humans deserve cultural communal encounters and renewal for healing
2061800	2070920	and inspiration of the mystery. And that's our birthright. Not I deserve a copay for a coded illness
2070920	2076440	for my worried wellness of tired, wired, stressed and anxious. And I've heard that this new magic
2076440	2083880	pill might allow me to keep going as one more how slightly better adjusted cog in the neoliberal
2083880	2091320	machine. Wow, you just said a lot of things that are that kind of I'm going to have to
2091320	2095240	sit and reflect on everything you just said and rewatch that clip because that yeah,
2096760	2103480	well said, well said. And I've jotted down quite a few notes, but I think on a on a grand level,
2103480	2110120	you made me think of this progress narrative that we've been given that if you're really
2110120	2114680	materialist in your thinking, things are just getting better and better and better. We have
2114680	2122520	more stuff. Everybody has a bigger flat screen TV. They often point to metrics like life expectancies
2122520	2129160	longer, child infant mortality is lower. Look at all our pharmaceuticals, look at our health
2129160	2134280	industry, look at how much food people have. And they say that's a progress narrative. Is that
2134280	2141560	progress narrative a lie? Yeah, I mean, that's such a good question. That's literally the subject
2141560	2151880	of my next book. And I'm so I'm deep into the research right now. And I mean, I think the only
2151880	2156600	honest answer and I actually had this conversation with Daniel Schmackenberger several years ago,
2156600	2162360	it just hasn't, you know, the foundational conditions are the same, which is is that
2163320	2169240	for most of us right now, it's bafflingly confusing to figure out kind of quote unquote,
2169240	2175320	what's really going on? Because when you do see Hans Rosling or Steven Pinker or, you know,
2175320	2182200	pick your favorite Ted talk, you're like, Oh, my gosh, you know, this is the most peaceful we've
2182200	2186760	ever been. This is the most people living above the poverty line. This is, you know, just the
2186760	2193000	litany of public health statistics that are suggesting this is the best of times. And then
2193000	2197960	you end up either on an environmental channel or just doom scrolling your news feed. And you become
2197960	2204120	very quickly convinced, Oh, no, we are going off the cliff with no skid marks, you know, to our doom,
2204120	2209160	and we probably deserve it. You know, like, look how many dumb, terrible, stupid ass things we're
2209160	2215080	doing, we deserve what's coming. Like, and so things are getting exponentially worse and getting
2215080	2222360	exponentially better at precisely the same moment. And Oh, by the way, this super advanced techno
2222360	2227560	industrial society with pronounced civil liberties and incredible hyper mobility and access to the
2227560	2232520	world's information, you know, is also the very same container that is allowing us to do all these
2232520	2237880	personal growth and healing and waking up experiences. Right. And so you sort of you wake up,
2237880	2243080	and then you're like, Oh, my God, wait, when did I wake up? I woke up now in this moment. I mean,
2243080	2250440	I had that experience going skiing in Colorado a few years ago. And it was a spring skiing and
2250440	2258520	we're rolling into town and everything was melting. Right. And it was early, like it was it
2258520	2264360	felt like May and it was actually mid March. And you know, there was muddy waters down the streets
2264360	2268520	and there was grass and straw showing around, you know, and there we are riding this lift and
2268520	2274200	they just, you know, having lived most of our life in Colorado and knowing the history of the ski
2274200	2278040	industry, you're like, Holy shit. So I'm riding this lift and I'm watching everything melt around
2278040	2281800	us and being like, Hmm, I don't know how much longer the ski industry is going to be a thing.
2281800	2287960	And then thinking, Wow, this ski industry was the direct byproduct of the military industrial
2287960	2293480	complex. The 10th Mountain Division had trained just over the hills from us. They went to Italy,
2293480	2297960	fought in the Alps. They all came back from the Alps, started Veil, started Aspen, started Sun Valley.
2298440	2303880	Right. The skis, we the skis and snowboards we ski on have advanced petrochemical, P tech
2303880	2307320	spaces that are super slidey with metal edges and all these things when flex patterns and all
2307320	2313160	this kind of stuff that the lifts and all the steel and all the all the things. Right. The very
2313160	2321000	techno industrial war mongering society that made this possible of like little monkeys sliding
2321000	2326760	down white stuff in the mountains for fun is also the very thing that's also melting this
2326760	2333400	planet's atmosphere. Right. And so that was just a tiny example of what we're experiencing globally
2333400	2339560	and at scale right now, which is that our awareness has gone through the roof at the same time that
2339560	2346760	what we need to be paying attention to or be made aware of is that the very same culture that has
2346760	2356760	birthed us is also threatening to kill us. And most people can't hold that cognitive dissonance.
2356760	2361480	So we toggle between the coming alive arc of like, what's the infinite? You know, what's my
2361480	2367880	hashtag best life? What's my optimum personal growth? What's the way do I want to go? Who do I
2367880	2372840	want to be unlimited possibilities? And then also societally, you know, what is a world where
2373480	2377160	any gender is welcome? What is a world of post-racial equality? What is a, you know,
2377160	2382040	what is a realm where the bottom four billion of the global south have equity and inclusion? And
2382040	2388120	we've made reparations for all the dirty, dirty deeds of the last 500 years, etc. Right. So that's
2388120	2393160	that's the coming alive arc. And it's sort of, it's not time bound and it's not resource dependent.
2393160	2398360	It's a sort of infinite open. What's the best thing we can possibly imagine and live into?
2399320	2404200	And then that gets clipped by the staying alive arc, which is very time bound and very resource
2404200	2409240	constrained. And it's like, Oh, shit, you know, should I have my money in fiat or crypto? Should
2409240	2415240	I get a, should I get an, you know, a golden passport in Portugal, you know, or maybe I've heard
2415240	2419640	that St. Kitts is dishing them out, or do I need to get down to Mexico or do I hunker down in the
2419640	2425880	US or do I fleet a Canada, right? Or those kinds of things. Or like, what do we do? Right with
2425880	2431880	best places on the maps? I mean, a buddy of ours was, was it was an SVP at Google,
2432840	2438280	who got super freaked out during, I think it was the 2018 California fires or maybe it was
2438280	2442360	later than that actually, because it was during COVID, it was that super dystopian situation
2442360	2448520	where families were like fleeing San Francisco to get to Tahoe, where they could see sky and their
2448520	2453160	kids could breathe again in the midst of a pandemic with masks on, you're like, Oh my gosh, this is,
2453160	2456600	you know, this is bleak, right? That wig them out to the point where he's like, Okay,
2457320	2462200	California's off my list. I'm moving my family somewhere to be safe. And he did all the research
2462200	2466280	being a, you know, an engineering quanti guy with the world's best search engines at his fingertips.
2466280	2471800	And he concluded that Lahaina Maui was the safe place on an island in the middle of the Pacific
2471800	2477480	in a tropical rainforest. And that's where he was going to post up. And he got clipped. Right with
2477480	2481960	the Lahaina fires, which, you know, kind of reminds me of the, there's again, an old Greek story of
2482920	2489800	someone going to the Oracle at Delphi and being told, tomorrow you will, you will die. And he
2489800	2495800	flees Athens for spotter. He's like, Oh, fuck that noise. I'm getting out of dodge. And then
2495800	2501960	runs into the Reaper in a crowd in spotter. And he's shocked. And he's like, What are you doing?
2501960	2507560	And he's like, I was waiting for you. So that notion for all of us these days that there's sort
2507640	2515800	of, there is no a way. And it's on us to pick our spot to make our stand and then get on with living
2515800	2522360	through this feels like an important part of how do we reconcile that impossible contradiction of
2522360	2526280	things are exponentially better and worse at the same time? And where do I even map that? Right?
2526280	2529560	I mean, I think if you think, if you've heard, in fact, I guess people have heard of it because
2529560	2534280	it's called the three body problem is isn't that that the new HBO show, right with the Game of
2534280	2540200	Thrones guys, I think it is, but anyway, the three body problem refers to in astronomy slash
2540200	2545480	physics, it's very, very hard to map and model is one thing to map like the moon going around the
2545480	2550280	earth. But when you throw in the sun and the moon and the earth and where all things are in
2550280	2557880	relationships to each other, it gets herdy, goody in a hurry. And we've got an eight billion body
2557880	2563960	problem, all agentic little egos bouncing around each other. So how on earth we map them
2565160	2573160	leads to cognitive shorting out leads to emotional psychological overwhelm and leads to
2574040	2580760	boatloads of grief, as we potentially run all the traps run the numbers and come to the conclusion
2580760	2588840	that the world as we have known it might not actually be as stable or foreordained or given
2588840	2595240	or even, you know, predictably carrying forwards as we might have thought, as we might have hoped,
2595240	2602520	as we might have been led to believe. So how do we grieve in all of this? Also, you know, in a healthy
2602520	2609640	way, you know, in a powerful way, in a way that leaves us cleansed and grounded and stronger and
2609640	2616840	wiser versus in a way that leaves us kicking and screaming and embittered and feeling victimized
2617480	2622600	feels like a super important part of what you know, what life might look like going forward or
2622600	2627880	kind of part of the immune our immune systems. That will be really helpful for us to develop.
2629240	2634040	Hmm. Well, part of that progress narrative is that technology is going to save us. And that's
2634040	2639160	going to be our get out of jail free card. Do you think that we could develop some technology that
2639160	2645000	fixes all our problems? Yeah, I mean, Mark Andreessen, right, of Andreessen Horowitz, you know,
2645000	2650840	famously, infamously wrote the techno optimist manifesto last year. And he was basically coming
2650840	2658920	down hard on the side of technology progress is it has always been with God knows what's got us
2658920	2667560	out of the last pickle. It is forever will be. And anybody who isn't for utterly unregulated
2667560	2672360	affected, you know, the term that sort of showed up on Twitter is effective accelerationism,
2673080	2678520	right, instead of effective altruism, right, the idea of just like pin it. Let's put every penny
2678520	2685720	and every calorie and every gigawatt we've got into general artificial intelligence, basically a
2685720	2693560	silicon God. And that'll fix it. Which, you know, if anybody's seen, you read the stories of Dr.
2693560	2699240	Faustus or seen Fantasia with Mickey and the Sorcerer's Apprentice, you know, or any countless,
2699240	2706280	countless tale where humans are tempted to go for ultimate power or knowledge, right, and they try
2706280	2710520	and grab for that ring, you know, there's not a single story where that one comes up roses.
2711080	2716840	So there's a lot in our kind of mythical memory, as well as our historical memory of, you know,
2716840	2723000	all we ever do is kick the can down the road to greater, more complex, wicked problems from
2723000	2728360	solving our earlier ones. You know, and some of the classics would be, oh, you know, London fog,
2728360	2732280	right, London fog was because we were burning too much coal. And then we discovered, you know,
2732280	2737800	quote unquote, cleaner burning diesel and hydrocarbons fossil fuels, actually liquid fuels,
2737800	2742760	that was much better London London fog as a pollution went away. The, you know, New York and
2742760	2747480	Chicago and Paris and London were, you know, in the 1890s were up to their kneecaps and horseshocks
2747480	2752360	of all the carriages. And then Henry Ford invented the Model T. See, look, we keep doing this,
2752360	2760840	right. And so there are these really well worn tropes about what is our direction does is there
2760840	2765800	a teleological thrust, meaning is there a point or a purpose to where we're going. And then all the
2765800	2771480	stories of progress are yes, it's high into the right, right, the curve goes up, and we're on
2771480	2778760	times arrow, it's going someplace, which really wasn't, you know, wasn't argue arguably, that is
2778760	2785000	a highly Judeo Christian concept, right. It's not until the Hebrew and Christian sacred scriptures
2785000	2789640	had an alpha and had an alpha in the beginning was the word and the word was good, right,
2790280	2795720	and an omega, an endpoint that we actually got to have connect two dots on a line and create
2795720	2800920	times arrow. Now, there's all sorts of reasons, you'll your pregine, the Nobel laureate and
2800920	2804920	physics and others have, you know, played with, you know, what, what is the notion of times
2804920	2810520	arrow, not just as a cultural story, but as potentially a deep code of physical reality,
2810520	2815560	aka you can't unscramble an omelet, those kind of things, there's certain appearances of
2815560	2820680	directionality that breaks down at a quantum level. And and pregine actually had another
2821880	2825400	really meaningful contribution to this, so just to be clear, so we're talking about Mark
2825400	2829800	Andreessen posting something on, you know, effective altruism or effective accelerationism,
2829800	2834120	we're talking about the sort of tried and true progress narrative. And now we're kind of kicking
2834120	2840040	it down to well, what's true at the base levels of reality. And pregine advanced this notion of
2840040	2845480	complex dissipative structures, and that a complex dissipative structure could be a human, like we,
2846040	2851800	talking, breathing, loving, writing poetry, doing whatever, we're far more complex than the 28
2851800	2856520	minerals and elements that make up our bodies, right. And when we die, we go back to decomposing
2856520	2861640	and pushing up daisies, and that is a less complex state than we were when we were alive. So a human
2861640	2867720	is a complex dissipative structure, when we need constant inputs of energy, aka food and water,
2867720	2873800	or we die, right, and that's the dissipating part. And so are civilizations. And the more
2873800	2878680	complex our civilizations get, the more energy they need to keep them going without collapsing.
2878680	2882840	And of course, as we're contemplating for the first time in human history, a transition from
2882840	2888680	burning ever denser carbon, right, in fact, West Jackson, who's at the Land Institute in
2888680	2892760	Salina, Kansas, he's one of the great kind of environmental and ecologists, he's a sort of
2892760	2896920	contemporary of Wendell Berry. He said something interesting, he said, basically, you can make
2896920	2904200	a case that all of human civilization is just the hunt for ever denser carbon, and ever hotter fire,
2905080	2909480	right. So from like rubbing sticks together, you know, and just burning up trees and twigs,
2909480	2916200	and that kind of stuff, to ceramics and kilns, like now we can actually cure Earth in a
2916200	2920920	waterproof, bugproof storage container for our grains. So now we can take starlight
2920920	2925720	in the form of photosynthesis and grain production, and we can bend time, right,
2925720	2930520	by keeping it in pots. And then the Bronze Age, oh my gosh, if we dig up some of this stuff, we'd
2930520	2935800	dig up tin and copper, and we put it in a hot enough fire, we can make bronze, that's amazing.
2935800	2939720	We have swords and poke people and beat the shit out of the people that don't have
2939720	2944280	sharper, pokey things. And so then you get into the Iron Age, oh my gosh, even better.
2944360	2950120	And then all the way into the Silicon Age, we can melt sand, turn it into glass, turn it into
2950120	2955160	lenses, turn it into silicon chips. But at 1500 degrees, right, all the way to like the Large
2955160	2961800	Hadron Collider, where we have the light and heat of our sun. So we're forever hunting hotter fire
2961800	2966680	to heat ever more dense and interesting star stuff, to our own benefit and advantage.
2967640	2972120	Which, back to Prigagine, and the notion of complex dissipative structures, right,
2972200	2979000	is the idea that he makes the case, and other physicists and writers who've kind of built
2979000	2987000	on his work since, is that our complexity, our civilization, all the cool stuff that we like
2987000	2994760	to think of as, you know, human, isn't actually random. It's actually a very, very elegant way
2994760	2998840	of the universe reconciling the second law of thermodynamics, a.k.a. all things tend to
2998840	3002600	entropy over time. Because if you're in that camp, you're like, oh, we're just, we're just
3002600	3008200	random fluctuations where we shouldn't be here, roll the dice a million times more and we wouldn't
3008200	3014440	be here, right? There is no point or purpose. We're an accident of randomized genetic mutation,
3014440	3020920	right? There's definitely that camp, right? Prigagine would say, hey, yes, it's true that the
3020920	3026520	universe tends towards the heat, you know, heat death, right, and a complete unspooling of all
3026520	3031640	order and complexity over time. But wouldn't you know it? A complex dissipated structure is actually
3031640	3037560	the universe's best way to get to entropy in the end. So if you take an example of like, if there's,
3037560	3042920	if, you know, your bathtub is filled with water, and then it needs to drain all the way to daylight,
3042920	3046760	you know, through your basement, through your pipes out to the stream or the river, right?
3046760	3051880	Well, what does it do? It creates a whirlpool, which is a complex dissipated structure. It is one
3051880	3057960	of the best ways to take an energy gradient of a ton of water, resisting gravity, you know,
3057960	3065160	high to all the water going low and draining out. What's the best thing? Create a whirlpool
3065160	3069240	to migrate it. The same thing with hurricanes, right? You've got a low pressure and a high pressure
3069240	3072840	system. You've got someplace that's really cold and dense, and you've got someplace that's hot and
3072840	3078120	light and it's, and if it's powerful enough, what does it do? It creates that giant whirlpool
3078120	3086120	situation and it mixes, right? It very, very effectively mixes the energy gradient. It balances
3086120	3093640	it. So if you're in that prigogene camp, you would say, hey, we are complex dissipated structures.
3093640	3101560	We are enacting. So we have a purpose and it's a way to reconcile the second law of thermodynamics.
3101560	3109080	This all ends in the ditch, right? With the goodness, truth and beauty that may emerge,
3109080	3116120	right, in us and we're not just random accidents. We are actually agents centered in the bigger and
3116120	3123880	greater unfolding of universal physical and energetic processes. So now let's go back to,
3123880	3128680	because that's just kind of like, that's a nerdy sidebar, but I think it's super important because
3128680	3134440	if you're just dealing with like warring, like Twitter wars, like Mark Andreessen and the EX
3134440	3138920	versus the degrowth or D cell haters, and you just piss in a pissing match at that level,
3140120	3148520	we're not necessarily kind of taking in the whole context and getting beyond opinions and into
3149240	3159800	outlooks that are potentially rooted in more deeply structural reality. So, right, the reality
3159800	3167000	of, hey, is technology going to save us, right, is the way forwards even faster, right, the folks
3167000	3170520	that are like, again, like Mark Andreessen, he has a great phrase, he said, we're teaching sand to
3170520	3174680	think, right, and that's what we're doing with artificial general intelligence. And you can make
3174680	3179080	a case like, are we just being carbon based life form chauvinist? Is it just because we're
3179080	3182920	carbon based life forms? And everything else we know on this planet is carbon based that we
3182920	3187720	somehow have a prejudice, like we're special and unique, and we're the honest and good and true,
3187720	3192920	but silicon based consciousness is somehow an abomination, and we should prosecute it and shut
3192920	3198760	it down. Like, that's an interesting question. You know, and that's where Larry Page has been,
3198760	3202680	that that was the rift between him and Elon, where he was basically, you know, he accused Elon
3202680	3206760	famously of being a speciesist, you know, like you actually, you know, Sam Altman has said,
3208040	3212440	in fact, he came on right after us, giving a talk at Benningman, a couple of it was,
3212440	3216840	it was like six months before ChatGPT launched, so it was before he, you know, he, his, his sort of
3217720	3222760	recognizability had blown up to the level it is now. And he said, basically, there's only two
3222760	3228840	options for humans, we either become cyborgs, meaning we're sort of like supplemented augmented,
3228840	3235160	you know, but not just biological people anymore. Or we just become bootloaders to
3235160	3239480	silicon consciousness. We're just the little monkeys with thumbs that were just clever,
3239480	3245080	just clever enough to dig up all this stuff and heat hot fires, right, and make the silicon and
3245080	3251800	organize a bunch of buried fossil fuels starlight and energy to pump into the grid until, you know,
3251800	3254840	silicon consciousness could boot up and say, thanks very much, you clever little monkeys,
3254840	3259800	we're now going to eliminate you, you know, or enslave you, you know, Allah, Skybot and the
3259800	3269240	Matrix and everything else, or Skynet. Yeah, so, so I think there's a, you know, a very practical
3269240	3275960	and real question, which is, can we decouple, like what, you know, Gwyneth Paltrow, I think,
3275960	3280920	famously talked about conscious uncoupling, like for divorces that don't get nasty, right. And I think,
3281560	3286440	for all of us, there's a question of what is conscious decoupling look like. And in this
3286440	3292920	instance, it's, it's, can we decouple our carbon burn, right, from our quality of life?
3294360	3303400	And if we can, then we buy the time and the, and the options to architect a more inclusive,
3303400	3310120	more creative civilizational structure. And if we can't, then there's very real questions back to
3310120	3314520	the degrowth side of the argument, which is like, Hey, no, actually, look, look at us, we're, we're,
3314520	3321480	we're grossly obese, we're wildly unhappy. You know, Marie Kondo became a thing because there's,
3321480	3326760	you know, $23 billion storage industry, like we have way too much stuff. And we literally have
3326760	3333320	way too many calories hanging on our bodies, like clearly we've overshot some sweet spot,
3333320	3339320	right, for quality of life versus energy bone. Even though that that even that statement
3340360	3344520	seems surprisingly controversial, you'll still get slammed with being a degrowth or in a D cell,
3344520	3350440	and you'll be accused of wanting to deny some poor starving, you know, grandmother in Africa or
3350440	3354680	India, you know, denying her the right for her refrigerator and cell phone and air conditioning,
3354680	3359000	you know, you're like, no, no, no, that's not what we're talking about. Right. But we are saying,
3359000	3366360	is there, is there a mark we've overshot on calorie burn versus the quote unquote good life?
3367000	3373720	And can we, because many of the sort of eco optimists and Hannah Ritchie is the most recent,
3373720	3377080	she's at Oxford, and she just recently published a book, I think called It's Not the End of the
3377080	3382920	World, but she's a protege of Hans Rosling and Max Roser at the Our World in Data project.
3384440	3387960	You know, they're basically making the case of like, hey, guys, we can have everything.
3388760	3395000	Right. Everybody can have, all we need to do is just heat pumps and Teslas, right. And we don't
3395000	3402360	need to back off on any of the stuff we've got. Right. And also some, you know, rhetorical play
3402360	3410200	to that mother in Africa or India and giving her a chance of the good life too, which fundamentally
3410200	3417880	is their own socializations of Simon Cousnets, the Nobel Prize winning economist who came up with
3417880	3423160	GDP, but he also came up with something called the Cousnets curve. Right. And specific subset of
3423160	3427880	the Cousnets curve is the EKC, the environmental Cousnets curve. And you've definitely heard this
3427880	3431400	argument, even if you didn't know, that's what it was called. It was just basically that more
3431400	3437160	advanced societies pollute less. Right. So that basically all of Europe and the United States,
3437160	3442680	et cetera, we're on the happy far right side of the Cousnets curve. And we don't have, what would
3442680	3447320	we do, but we just, we're not still building as many dirty coal power plants. We don't have people
3447320	3451080	using diesel and kerosene heaters to heat their homes or we're going to cook their foods, et cetera,
3451080	3457880	et cetera. So basically Ikea and Volvos and Tesla's good, you know, in Western Europe and the US
3457880	3465960	and coal and kerosene, you know, in China and India bad. And the goal there, you silly humans,
3465960	3470120	right, is to get everybody up and over the Cousnets curve as fast as possible. And any
3470120	3475000	efforts to pump the brakes is wrong-headed, counterproductive, destructive and anti-human.
3475000	3479560	That's typically the argument. Right. Now, back to motivated reasoning, like we were talking about
3479560	3483720	Karl Hart, the functioning opioid user slash professor, arguing for cognitive liberty and
3483720	3489320	people getting to shoot up and do what they want to do. We are massively motivated to accept the
3489320	3497400	argument and that sort of the almost religious dogma of the Cousnets curve because it gives us
3497400	3503400	permission to keep doing exactly what we wanted to do anyway. Right. And the realities are there
3503400	3507400	have been quite a bit of, there's been quite a bit of kind of, you know, replication studies and
3507400	3512520	those kind of things on the Cousnets curve. It doesn't exist always. It's not a law of nature.
3512520	3516840	It was most pronounced at a very specific time and place, which was post World War II in Western
3516840	3524360	Europe and kind of the G20 countries, OECD, you know, North America, et cetera. It hasn't replicated
3524360	3528280	in a bunch of other countries like in Asia and other places in the global south that have attempted
3528280	3532520	it since then. And it's wildly variable and dependent on a bunch of conditions, including
3532520	3537880	are you at war or not? Like, like this war is not going to be eco-groovy ever. We burn a ton of
3537880	3543160	shit and we blow up a ton of shit and we don't care because it's war. Right. So there's a thousand
3543160	3549800	reasons why the Cousnets curve is not a law of nature, even though it's implicit in every single
3549800	3556200	pro-growth argument you pretty much ever hear. And up against it is Javon's paradox. And Javon's
3556200	3561640	paradox is when things get cheaper, you don't consume them cheaper, better, faster, cheaper.
3562440	3567480	You typically don't end up with a decrease in usage and consumption. You actually end up spiking
3567480	3572360	and incenting even more consumption. So as we've done all the wind and all the solar and all the
3572360	3576680	batteries and all the good groovy stuff, right, our carbon burn right now is higher than ever.
3578120	3583640	So it's basically Cousnets curve versus Javon's paradox. Right. Can we say enough is enough?
3583640	3591320	Can we buy some efficiencies and bank them or is every innovation going to then incent even further
3591320	3595160	extreme growth? And as a funny example of that, right, I was just reading this morning that the
3595160	3600280	Paris Olympics were set out to be super groovy, low carbon footprint. Right. And of course,
3600280	3605960	they're French and, you know, historically, weather's been really quite nice and mild and
3605960	3611640	temperate in Paris in the summers. So they didn't bake in air conditioning, right, to all of that,
3611960	3617480	to the athlete's village. And now they've just done a survey. Every single one of the G8 countries,
3618040	3624680	right, minus the host, are bringing in portable air conditioners for their athletes because they're
3624680	3630280	like, no, fuck that. We are people cannot be flopping around on damp sheets, you know, before
3630280	3635480	their race day, they need to be in 68 degrees. So you see this fascinating thing of like Andrew
3635480	3643080	Huberman, Tim Ferriss, biohacking optimization culture, right, you should sleep cold and dark
3643080	3649400	in 68 degrees, which is awesome, right. I'm a huge, huge fan of cold nights, but it's an incredible
3649400	3655960	privilege. And the fact that France attempted to make these Olympics as clean and groovy as possible,
3655960	3661720	but in that stand has run right up against carbon footprints and it would have been far on the irony
3661720	3665800	is they would have been far more eco groovy if they'd actually baked in air conditioning properly
3666360	3671960	into their builds versus having everybody run extension cords, you know, to generators,
3671960	3676600	to run little portable units. And so just back, that's back to coming alive versus staying alive,
3676600	3681560	those two arcs, coming alive, hey, 68 degrees is your optimum sleep temp to get your earring best
3681560	3687880	scores. And staying alive is, oh my gosh, we're burning so much fossil fuel, we're overheating the
3687880	3697000	earth. Wow, that was brilliantly said, I love that rant. And you just, you said so many things.
3697000	3704760	And I guess I, one thing I wanted to mention is the changing narratives.
3706680	3712600	Particularly, I can use movies as an example. I remember when I was young in the 90s, we had
3712600	3718120	movies that were about humans saving the world. It was like Armageddon, deep impact,
3718760	3724440	some huge comment was going to hit us and we had to stop it. Then probably about 10 years later,
3724440	3730440	I noticed a changing narrative where earth is is we've messed up earth too much, and we have to
3730440	3734840	leave and find some other home. I'm thinking of movies like interstellar. And that seemed to be
3734840	3739960	like a common theme. I started seeing that a lot more. And then maybe about 10 years later,
3740520	3745560	I noticed movies that were really pessimistic that humans weren't really a species worth
3746360	3751720	keeping going. So we were going to end humans now. And we're going to pass the torch on to
3751720	3758040	something new. And I noticed that theme. I'm also noticing a similar change in narrative with AI.
3758600	3761880	You know, for a long time, we had all these movies that made AI the villain.
3762600	3766200	That it was this huge existential threat that was going to take humans out.
3767000	3772200	Now I'm starting to see some interesting movies coming out, where AI is the good thing,
3772200	3777400	and it keeps society together. And the villain is somebody that comes and shuts that AI off,
3778200	3783560	and then causes chaos. And I thought, Oh, that's a really interesting like predictive programming
3783560	3789640	that you're trying to instill in us. And I guess it makes me think that there's some sort of anti
3789640	3795800	human agenda. You mentioned that there's this camp of people that think that we're like
3795880	3803000	accidents. And I believe that that anti human agenda is coming from that side.
3803640	3806200	Are you seeing it all like an anti human agenda?
3808680	3813400	Yeah, I mean, that's such a great question. And I'm a huge fan of tracking things in film,
3813400	3820280	exactly as you did. Like what's the pulse? What's the zeitgeist of our moment, right? And I certainly
3820280	3827480	noticed it with Marvel comics, and even Black Panther, where you had both Thanos and Killmonger,
3828200	3833640	right? As the anti heroes, they were the bad guys. But the bad guys were actually expressing
3833640	3837560	more of what was potentially kind of in the discourse or in our conversation than ever.
3837560	3843080	Like Thanos wasn't wrong. He's like, Look, my planet got trashed. I concluded, right, then in
3843080	3847720	order to save the universe had to kill half the people or something like that, right? Therefore,
3847720	3853400	the Thanos snap. And then he got ostracized and he became the super scary bad guy, right?
3853400	3858360	But he wasn't wrong. He's like, there's too many people for the carrying capacity of this ecosystem.
3858360	3861960	And I think we get wildly more efficient, but don't succumb to the Javons paradox of just
3861960	3865240	getting fatter and greedier and consuming more, right? But we actually get more efficient and
3865240	3870440	consume the same or less. But we're not doing that. So I've got to take drastic measures
3870440	3875000	to save things. But he's the villain. And you're like, Yeah, you had a point there.
3875080	3879160	And Killmonger, who I don't quite remember his entire narrative, but I do remember it was
3879160	3886120	fundamentally a sort of contemporary Malcolm X critique, right? There was that sense of like,
3886120	3892920	hey, colonialism, hey, racism, hey, all of these things, it's a stacked deck. And to play within
3892920	3899080	the system is kind of a fool's game. I need to break the system. And so you had many situations
3899080	3905960	where the critiques of the antihero or the villain are actually expressing some real things
3905960	3909720	for us to reckon with, whether or not we come down exactly where they did. It's just real issues
3909720	3921640	and topics to reckon with. So to your point about, are we flawed? Are we bad? You know, is there
3921640	3929800	something? I mean, to me, it seems very much like the, you know, the simple question is,
3930520	3937480	is the way forwards? Or do we need to backtrack? You know, is there somewhere where we fell from
3937480	3942600	grace? And therefore everything, if we keep going the way we've been going, we just sort of
3942600	3948840	do them to carry out our original sin. Or do we need to slam on the brakes and go back to a fork
3948840	3954280	in the road that we missed somewhere, right, to get back to righteousness, to get back to balance,
3954280	3959160	to get back to whatever. And you definitely see that with like Yuval Harari's book sapiens.
3959800	3964600	And I think most people were probably just sort of, you know, overwhelmed and bedazzled by,
3964600	3970680	you know, big history kind of take. So they just kind of took it all in. But he, you know, he smuggles
3970680	3977080	in some, you know, both totally familiar and some relatively controversial content, which is not
3977080	3983160	the least of which is we were super groovy. This is Marshall Salem's anthropology hypothesis back
3983160	3988200	in the late 60s of like, man, the hunter gatherer had like had more free time, right? It was egalitarian
3988200	3994520	societies. It was, it, we were, they were healthier. Everything was groovy. And then big time bad
3994520	4002440	farming came along. Right. And, and Harari just dusted that chest nut off and completely rebooted
4002520	4007480	it for sapiens. And everyone's like, Oh, yeah. And if people remember far enough back, there was a
4007480	4013160	very popular book in the 90s called Ishmael. And it was told by the point of view of a gorilla,
4013160	4017480	who was a talking gorilla. And he was basically like, like all of civilization is broken down into
4017480	4021880	levers and takers. And the levers are the groovy indigenous sustainable folks. And the takers are
4021880	4029080	the kind of, you know, beginnings of white Western capitalist patriarchy. And it resonated,
4029080	4035400	it sold millions of copies. And it was also, of course, grossly simplified. And those questions
4035400	4041320	though, right, you know, and even in our conversations around something as heart wrenching
4041320	4048280	and politically loaded as Gaza, and the Arab Israeli conflict right now, is being coded in
4048280	4055080	these terms. Right. So you're seeing the fact that on, you know, anti semitism has been a big
4055160	4061640	question, right? A big, a big issue both in US universities, like Columbia and Harvard and Penn,
4062520	4067320	as well as a bunch of other places, it's occupying tons of column inches. And it's also
4067320	4075640	completely gumming up our abilities to look clearly at a geopolitical crisis. And whose side
4075640	4079160	is on what and what's going on? Because, you know, one of the things just one second,
4079720	4085880	like, dude, I don't even know if I want to go into this. Do you want to? I mean, it's tight,
4085880	4089880	but it's just if we want it, it just depends on this is this is an absolute rats in
4089880	4093000	Islam. And I'm not going to be advocating a personal opinion on it, but I'm going to
4093960	4099400	potentially just unpack that whole tribalism, capitalism, colonialism thing.
4100680	4103400	That sounds great. Yeah. Is that all right? I mean, it sounds
4104920	4107480	like a great idea. Let's hear it. Okay.
4110120	4117160	So quite a bit of the, I mean, obviously, there's a tragic humanitarian situation
4118200	4125080	in Gaza right now and in Ukraine and in Darfur and in many places in the world. So Sub-Saharan
4125080	4132280	Africa is, you know, is on fire. There's all sorts of sadness and loss of life happening there.
4133640	4137480	Obviously, we've been tracking Ukraine for the last couple of years and most recently and
4140040	4143000	sort of explosively and controversially what's happening in Gaza.
4144600	4155800	Part of the support for Palestinians has been coded as Israelis as colonizers.
4157240	4165080	And that has then sort of activated the meme complex of social justice,
4165720	4173880	post-Marxist academic critiques in the United States. So when they get accused of anti-Semitism,
4174920	4183080	it's a relatively new kind of anti-Semitism, right? It's Jews as coded as white,
4184600	4191640	coded as colonizers, and colonizers are always bad and colonized,
4192360	4197480	a.k.a. Franz Fanon, you know, and Wretched of the Earth and Blackskins White Mask and other,
4197480	4202840	you know, other academics and thinkers in that space. And Mark Hughes and some others, which,
4202840	4207880	by the way, went straight into Ibram Kendi's philosophy of like, you know, you know, basically,
4207880	4215800	the cure to, you know, the, or the solution or response to racism is anti-racism directed at
4215800	4221400	the racists, right? So you ended up with some of those very tight arguments. So we end up with the
4221400	4229720	emergence of a new type of anti-Semitism, which is, which is coding Jews and specifically Israeli
4229720	4235800	Jews as white, as colonizers. Now, at the same time, which is very weird, because that's typically
4235800	4240120	that pro-Palestinian supporters coming from the progressive left, which has almost always been,
4241080	4246360	you know, huge supporters of ethnic diversity and inclusion. And then historically, the entire
4246360	4253400	American civil rights movement in the sixties was hand in glove Jewish college students and
4253400	4259400	Southern blacks. And that was a coalition and alliance. You know, and on the, on the far side,
4259400	4266840	on the right was the Ku Klux Klan, right, who famously, you know, were against reconstruction
4266840	4272280	and against black voting rights and participation and citizenship, but hot on the heels of that
4272280	4279640	hit list for the Klan were Catholics and Jews, right? So you're like, oh, wait a sec. Now,
4279640	4288200	how is it that now the American right seems to be the staunchest supporter of Israeli practices
4288200	4297240	and policies, right? When just 40 odd years ago, they were the ones who were most, most anti-Semitic
4297240	4303480	and that was a totally different anti-Semitism. That is Jews as other. So you've got Jews as
4303480	4307560	cultural other. And this is the protocol, you know, the protocols of the elders of Zion. This is
4307560	4312440	all the classic anti-Semitic tropes of Jews as separate Jews as not bowing down to our same
4312440	4317800	gods and the Jews as not, not loyal to the country or the nation that they live in, etc. It's all
4317800	4325240	the old school ethnic anti-Semitism, right? Where on the left, you have political anti-Semitism.
4325240	4331480	They're two completely different anti-Semitism, right? But they still end up in the chaos. And
4331480	4337480	then you think, okay, in that meme complex, right? What is the sort of elephant under the rug or
4337480	4345080	not even under the rug, right? With all coding or understanding of Jewishness. It's the Holocaust
4345800	4351240	and never again. Now you go onto the Palestinian side of the fence and you have,
4352200	4358520	you know, what's, what's the, what's the memetic anchor? 9-11 and ISIS. And all the way back to
4358520	4363400	the Crusades, right? But the idea of like, somewhere in there, you're having to respond to and either
4363400	4369560	accept or reject the notion of barbarism, of which October the 7th, tragically and sadly,
4370120	4377400	with Hamas's activities, reinvigorated. And now you end up with, with Palestinians coded as
4378040	4385000	colonized, therefore always just in their reactions against, oh, but what about Muslim
4385000	4390680	barbarism? Samuel Huntington, clash of civilizations, Sam Harris, right? With his railing against
4390680	4395480	Islam and saying, hey, you know, Islam didn't experience a Protestant, the equivalent of a
4395480	4400120	Protestant Reformation. They're basically a medieval death cult. You know, Sam Harris has, has been
4400120	4406440	quite adamant on some of those points. So you can kind of see both the meme map and how the
4406440	4414200	different characters in the plots are getting coded. And it's very, very confusing because we're
4414200	4421160	all running different scripts. And so we're not even seeing the same movie anymore. And therefore,
4421160	4427960	coming to any kind of humanitarian company, you know, and or, you know, governmental common ground
4428600	4433960	is damn near impossible. And the same thing is even happening in the environmental movement. I
4433960	4438200	occasionally have advised Extinction Rebellion, which was kind of, which came up with Greta Thunberg
4438200	4443160	and some of those others, they've led some of the most effective protests in 2018 to 2020.
4443160	4447480	And speaking with one of their founders, they're like, oh, well, you know, post George Floyd,
4447480	4453560	post quarantine, post all of those, those sort of social justice awakenings collectively, they're
4453560	4459640	like, we're not going to do anything until we've decolonized Africa. I mean, I'm paraphrasing,
4459640	4464440	but it was fundamentally that. And I just thought, oh, no, you know, like, you're one,
4464440	4469640	like, you're done, you're dead in the water, like, like, like, like, you've now got way too many
4469640	4473960	issues, you're just trying to solve the world and tire pain and all injustices everywhere,
4473960	4480120	while the clock is ticking on, you know, carbon and anything else. But what's really interesting to
4480120	4485800	me is, you know, and this is somewhat of a theme of our conversation, which is waking up and paying
4485800	4492600	attention to the enormity scope and scale of the world's suffering, the consequences of our
4492600	4499400	extended actions, and the potential grief of coming to terms with kind of the triaging of what's
4499400	4507880	possible and what's not. And what is delicate, fragile, wounded, but vital to protect, preserve
4507960	4514440	meant. What is kind of already done, it's cooked. So just basically cut our losses
4515000	4519480	and don't burn more time trying to fix something or prop something up that is fundamentally doomed.
4520120	4526760	And then what is new or different or better that we ought to with absolute clarity and speed
4528680	4536440	get to making or building soon. So in that, right, in our civilizational calculus,
4536440	4543240	you're kind of like, how did we end up here? And where did we go wrong? I actually had this
4543240	4547880	thought watching Darren Aronofsky, the director's moat, I don't know if it's his most recent,
4547880	4552200	but it was a recent documentary he did called The Territory, which is all about a relatively
4552200	4557240	uncontacted tribe in the Amazon. And it was just literally like this patch of rainforest that was
4557240	4561080	their territory. And it was shrinking and shrinking and shrinking and getting chopped on all sides.
4561720	4568200	And the first thing that blew me away about is that it was billed as here is this self-documentary
4568200	4572520	by a sort of an uncontacted tribe. And so I was like, okay, this is going to be neat. This is going
4572520	4579080	to be like that Robert Neera movie, The Mission with the Guarani or some other tribe from centuries
4579080	4583880	ago. And it wasn't the first thing was they were all wearing like O'Neill and Bill Among and Nike
4583880	4589880	t-shirts. And you're like, oh, sweet Jesus, like there they are wearing, of course they would dress
4589960	4595320	up in their ceremonial gob for a video shoot or doing a ceremony. But like fundamentally they're
4595320	4600680	kicking it in flip flops and branded Western logo t-shirts. And you're like, oh my God,
4600680	4605800	like that all reaches. And then they interviewed the white settlers that were being aided and
4605800	4610840	abetted by Bolsonaro's policies. And they were interviewing the younger generation of chiefs,
4610840	4615400	their chief, their newly appointed chief was like a 30 year old. And he was online and tech savvy,
4615400	4618920	and he was part of the one who was shooting and telling their stories. So super interesting,
4619000	4625400	kind of intersections of cultures. And nobody interviewed on either side of that situation
4625400	4629720	thought that they had any chance of turning back the tide of logging, settlement,
4630280	4636680	cattle farming, ranching, deforestation, you know, and cultural assimilation, assimilation. And even
4637400	4643720	last week, there was a New York Times article on a do-gooder white Christian woman, you know,
4643720	4650440	for whatever it was, from Kansas or Oklahoma, who had written a check to get 14 starlings
4651480	4657640	delivered to a remote tribe. And the whole hope was this could let them know when bad folks were
4657640	4661320	coming, whether it was oil or rubber or gas or for ranching and protect themselves, they could
4661320	4665080	coordinate, they could have better medical care, all the normal things. What happened is it completely
4665080	4669960	broke their society in six months flat. The kid, the men go all got addicted to porn. The teenagers
4669960	4674120	got stuck on their phones and stopped coming to meetings and stopped coming observing ceremonies
4674120	4678600	and the grandparents were scattered and fragmented. And at the end of all that, they're like,
4678600	4684440	and please don't take it away. So that got me deeply thinking, I'm like, Oh my God,
4684440	4693320	what is this sort of mollic notion? What is this giant, all devouring, all consuming beast that
4693320	4702120	just seems to be unstoppable? And how on earth do we reckon with it? And what occurred to me is
4702120	4710520	that, you know, capitalism is arguably one of the most efficient means of organizing matter
4710520	4717640	and energy that humans have ever devised in the simplest sense that it just continues to outcompete
4717640	4722520	all the other options. So you have to be like, okay, there's some there, there, however, but on
4722520	4727560	the other hand, look at the social, cultural, ecological cost is clearly not totally right.
4727560	4732440	Like there's something also deeply off about it. In what does it relentlessly keep doing?
4733080	4737160	And that's when I began to kind of inquire into, Oh, what is the, what is the calculus?
4737160	4741480	What is our civilizational calculus? What is the math problem or the math equation
4742120	4748440	that drives all of our behaviors? And what are we missing? You know, is there something in this
4748440	4753800	equation that it works, but it's missing key elements. And I began to wonder, and this goes
4753800	4759080	back to Gaza and the questions of antisemitism and colonialism and coding as whiteness. This goes
4759080	4763080	back to the environmental movements, and we have to decolonize the world and all of these elements.
4763080	4769560	And how are we fighting? And why do we keep over consuming like hungry ghosts? So it felt to me
4769560	4776040	like there were three major sort of phases. And this is in, this is kind of in order as to how
4776040	4781160	they unfolded historically, but none of them have ever unfolded in isolation from the others.
4781160	4788520	So they keep building on each other. So the first is tribalism, then colonialism, then capitalism.
4789400	4795160	And each of them has sort of, you know, natural intuitive logic as to why they exist and also
4795160	4800840	problems. And if we can figure out and solve for their problems, we might, might have a chance at
4800840	4807400	a slightly more healthy and sustainable civilization. So the first and most obvious is tribalism.
4808040	4813960	And its externality, the thing it doesn't include, right, is others. It's us versus them.
4814600	4820120	So it's a sort of, it's a social externality. There's the us, and we are literally quite often,
4820120	4825240	I mean, so many indigenous peoples own name for themselves. It's just the people, you know,
4825240	4828920	it's usually like in history books, it becomes, you know, they get called where the, whether it's
4828920	4833480	the Sue or the Iroquois or whomever it might be, it's typically their enemies call them that names
4833480	4838360	or the ones that became scouts or, you know, or collaborators with the Westerners get to name
4838360	4843320	the people. But the people is almost always the people, it's us. And we are right and good and
4843320	4849240	true. And everybody who's a part of our community is entitled to all the rights of our society and
4849240	4853480	how we operate. But if you live across the river, if you worship different gods, if you look funny,
4853480	4859640	talks funny, smell funny, right, you're them. And you are not the people and you are not like we
4859640	4864680	are not obliged to treat you the way we treat each other at all. And this is the barbarian,
4864680	4871080	this is the heretic, this is the apostate, right, this is the pagan, whatever it might be. So we get
4871080	4875720	to in the game of energy credits of like how do we move through this world and secure enough
4875720	4881400	resources to keep us alive and thriving, right, we don't have to extend that to you. We are not,
4881400	4887160	we are not the other's keeper, we are just our brother's keeper. So the externality is us versus
4887160	4893480	them. Right. And it works. It's literally from a mother parent and mother child bond to family bonds
4893480	4900840	to clan, you know, to tribe to clan to band to tribe to nation. That's how we do it. And tribalism
4900840	4906280	these days has been politicized into nation nationalism. Right. So it's still that same
4906280	4913400	through line, but it's ancient, ancient, ancient. The next is colonialism. Right. And colonialism
4913400	4920120	you could basically just say is asymmetric trade at the point of a sword. Right. So when you've got
4920120	4925960	tribes us versus them, there's still kind of thems that are closer to us than the then total
4925960	4931000	wildcards total barbarians. And there are neighbors, right, those are bloodlines, those are
4931000	4935000	intermarriage, those are geographic proximity, there's all those things and we trade with them.
4935640	4938760	All right. And you've got some cool stuff and we might specialize or we live closer to the
4938760	4943000	coast and you guys live in the forest or whatever it might be. And through extended trading networks
4943000	4949800	that are mostly balanced and reciprocal, we exchange goods and services and again, you know,
4949800	4955640	marriages into intermarriage and relationships and kinship ties. So that's trade. And that is
4955640	4962760	an enormous layer of human cultural extension and vitality and vibrancy. It raises the quality
4962760	4966200	of life of everyone who participates in it. Right. I mean, there are there are there are
4966200	4970920	examples of cowrie shells in the Great Plains, you know, that have made it thousands of miles
4970920	4975160	through trade networks to there. There's Pemicon, which is a sort of basically a super duper
4975160	4979400	trail mix with either bear fat and grease or salmon and berries and things done in the Pacific
4979400	4982920	Northwest that also made it to the Lakota and other and the Comanche and other places. You're
4982920	4987320	like, oh my gosh, sir, like the world has always been wildly interconnected, the Silk Route, all
4987320	4994520	of that kind of stuff. And but then when it ceases to be reciprocal and it becomes asymmetrical
4995160	5002760	and enforced by force, that's when you get colonialism. And the externality there is here,
5003320	5008680	AKA the country with the power or the tribe with the power versus there, we're going to chop down
5008680	5012520	your trees, we're going to hunt your beaver, we're going to enslave your people, we're going to dig
5012520	5018200	up your gold and silver and shiny things and we're going to take them from there over to here.
5018760	5023080	Right. And it's that great line at the end of the godfather, which was Honoré de Balzac,
5023080	5030200	but he said behind every great fortune lies a theft. And that's pretty much the bumper sticker
5030200	5036120	for colonialism. Right. And even to this day, where whether it's the Elgin marbles or various,
5036120	5040920	you know, the British Royal museums are stocked with loot from other countries and these other
5040920	5044440	countries are now self aware enough and politically active enough. And in case they're like, we'd
5044440	5049720	like our shit back, you know, and James Cameron, not James Cameron, sorry, David Cameron,
5050840	5054200	and other British politicians have been like, yeah, well, I mean, if we gave it all back,
5054200	5057640	we'd have nothing in our museum. So we're not giving we're not giving it back. And you're kind
5057640	5064200	of like, oh, my gosh, that is really as pronounced an example of here versus there externalities
5064200	5069080	as you could think of. And then the final one is capitalism. This kind of gets us back to
5069640	5076600	Aronofsky and the territory and sort of what is this giant all consuming machine. And capitalism,
5076600	5085800	its externality is now versus later. We will always take the profit now this month, this quarter,
5085800	5093640	this year, we will always over fish over hunt over log over farm over grays, because to extract the
5093640	5100040	profit now, more to the point to not extract the profit now is goes against everything we believe,
5100040	5107880	including legally enforceable penalties, right, Milton Friedman, the economist famously advanced
5107880	5113960	first in a New York Times article, and then in like 1971 or 72 of just like the sole purpose of
5113960	5118680	a company should be just to maximize shareholder profits. And that was just him thinking out
5118680	5124520	loud. It was an op ed in the magazine on a Sunday. And it wasn't until like 1985 or 1986,
5124520	5130120	where the Revlon shampoo company was going to be hostile, he bought out and they and their
5130120	5133720	board members tried to sue to prevent it because they're like, we're going to be bought out by this
5133720	5137560	cheap ass five and dime store that's just going to gut us for parts and ruin our brain and we want
5137560	5143800	to block the sale. And so mid 80s was when it actually got enshrined in federal law. No, no,
5143800	5150360	actually, Friedman was right. sole responsibility of shareholders is to maximize profits. So that
5150360	5155160	opened up the whole Gordon Gekko greed is good 1980s, like with the hostile takeovers and leverage
5155160	5161880	buyouts and all of that. It also forced John Mackie to sell Whole Foods to Amazon, because he
5161880	5167400	was getting he was being strong on by a venture capital fund that earned 8% earned 8% of Whole
5167400	5171320	Foods and was going to basically gut them for parts because all of the inefficiencies in their
5171320	5175160	business like supporting organic farmers and having healthy policies for their for their
5175160	5179880	employees, all of that was just wasn't was not justifying. And that's how he ended up having
5179880	5185720	to sell to Amazon. And it's also what prompted the Twitter board to accept Elon Musk's wildly
5185720	5189480	overpriced offer for Twitter, even though they were deeply concerned as to what he was going to
5189480	5194440	do about it, because they because basically they were as members as members of the board,
5194440	5200760	they were fiduciarily responsible and subject to being sued. If they hadn't accepted that wildly
5200760	5205640	overpriced offer for Twitter, which if you were an old school lover of Twitter, and you really
5205640	5209720	cared for and cherished the way Jack Dorsey and the others had built the thing and what that
5209720	5214280	community and cultural, you know, you might have been right to see this as coming destruction.
5214920	5221640	But they had to say yes, no matter what their personal feelings were. So capitalism is always
5221640	5226440	eating your seed corn, right? The idea of like typically right farmers will always want to save
5227240	5231720	corn to then plant for the next harvest. If you eat your seed corn because you're too hungry in
5231720	5235560	the winter and you didn't plan right, then you've got nothing to plant the next year and then you're
5235560	5242280	doubly triply out of luck. So if you take a look at those three things, tribalism, the externality
5242280	5250280	is them at the expense of us, or us, sorry, us at the expense of them. Colonialism is there,
5250840	5256760	or Jesus Christ. Colonialism is here at the expense of there. And capitalism
5258040	5265960	is now at the expense of later. So a tidy integration of those things is to say how
5265960	5271800	would we fix the math so that our civilizational calculus actually spits out healthy, sustainable,
5271800	5278520	equitable answers is to say instead of us versus them, right, it's everyone.
5279480	5288440	Instead of here versus there, it's everywhere. And instead of now versus later, it's everyone.
5289880	5294760	So if we built our civilizational calculus, instead of having all these externalities,
5294760	5299720	right, that other people and other places and other times have to get stuck with the bill,
5300840	5305240	right, get bankrupted, if we could all settle on everyone everywhere, everyone
5305240	5312680	is how we choose to make decisions going forward. We would have a shot at making the most of the
5312680	5319400	tools, the very deep structural cultural tools we have of tribalism, trade, right, and commerce
5319400	5327640	and innovation and bundle them together in ways that don't keep spitting out pathological or dysfunctional
5327720	5336040	answers. That was beautifully presented. And once again, I'm going to have to review what you
5336040	5342600	just said and think on it over and over again. You have an amazing way of just putting these
5342600	5348840	very complex ideas together. And I'm scribbling down notes so fast that my paper is catching
5348840	5357640	on fire here. But I'm wondering, can these three levels, the colonization, the capitalism and the
5357640	5363640	tribalism, could that be solved on an individual level? Or is this something that a third party
5363640	5373160	system needs to come in and fix? Well, I mean, gosh, that is such a massive question. I think
5373160	5382280	the simplest is there's so much inertia behind all of these things that individual change is
5382280	5389880	sort of necessary, but not sufficient. And that is, and again, in the same way that that
5389880	5393960	environmental cosnets curve, the idea of like, oh, the way forward is faster because, you know,
5393960	5398920	advanced societies pollute less, but we really kind of want to just hear that so we don't scrutinize
5398920	5405800	it too much as to how it's consistently true is that notion. The idea that change comes from within,
5405800	5411560	and if I want to heal the world, I have to work first to heal myself, becomes an incredible bit
5411560	5417880	of motivated reasoning to just shove my head all the way up my ass in a bunch of narcissistic
5417880	5425000	personal growth and self-help, which is without a doubt just a part of neoliberal capture of
5425000	5430520	fragmented, isolated consumer individuals scratching all the itches that get agitated
5430520	5435720	via the constant barrage of marketing messages of quick fixes and easy hits and utopian outcomes.
5436280	5442360	So in that level, it is sort of again, yes, of course, if you come from hate, you will so hate,
5443000	5447720	you know, you plant ice, you're going to harvest wind, right? So there is some element of interior
5447720	5454040	change. And if you look at the largest, most, you know, high impact change agents, at least in the last,
5454040	5460280	you know, few decades from Nelson Mandela to Gandhi to King to kind of the usual suspects,
5460840	5466600	they all were coming from a fundamentally different frequency than the tribal people they led.
5467240	5471400	And Malcolm X as well, right? And Fred Hampton, there's a number of instances where
5472360	5480360	that those leaders were clearly vibrating, you know, on a different frequency than the
5480360	5487000	center of gravity of the people they inspired and fundamentally led. So a huge, you know,
5487000	5493240	hat tip and acknowledgement to the power of transformational consciousness and its ability
5493800	5501160	to set a tone that otherwise a bunch of disorganized, fractious primates would never get to in a
5501160	5505000	million years. I often think of it like we used to live in Santa Barbara and there was this
5505000	5511240	historic Sunday sunset drum circle on the beach. And our music teacher, who was this brilliant
5511880	5523560	Sarod and Satara player, he and his crew of Tabla and Gembe and Conga players would often be there
5523560	5527560	and they would be the core of the drum circle. And you'd go on those nights and that drum circle
5527560	5533560	was tear the roof off funky, right, with hundreds of people like huge energy pulsing. And the thing
5533560	5538840	was amazing. And then they would be on tour. And you go down there on that weekend. And there was
5538840	5543720	nobody who was deeply, deeply talented gifted in the center of that drum circle. And it would be a
5543720	5550280	noodley, mushy hippie shit show. And so you do kind of think like, Oh, who's the metronome? Who's
5550280	5557080	the timekeeper? Because it's far easier. Like it takes a field to hold a field. It takes somebody's
5557080	5563080	coherent energy to then bring everybody into that. It's far easier to follow a good beat
5563080	5570040	than it is to hold one yourself if you're not trained. The flip side is, is that in order for
5570040	5577000	us to sort of quote unquote, fix at a societal level, or at a global level, the other element.
5577000	5584360	So tribalism is just, you know, basically after oxytocin, you know, which bonds mother to child
5584360	5590440	and, and, you know, tribe to tribe, everything and everything is optional. So all of our humanist
5590520	5593960	elements, all of our efforts to say, Hey, that person on the other side of the world that I
5593960	5598040	don't know, that doesn't worship the same cause, that doesn't speak the same language or eat the
5598040	5604280	same foods, and I'll never meet again, is entitled to something intrinsically human as am I? Like
5604280	5610680	that is an incredibly fragile experiment. And it is not encoded into our DNA, into our biology,
5610680	5616360	into our neurochemistry, or even in any level of our survival and printing. Like I mean mine.
5616760	5623240	Now, and next is our survival and printing. So everyone, everywhere, everyone is Bodhisattva
5624120	5631400	level awareness, and it's fragile. But as far as like helping like colonialism, you know,
5631400	5637000	the idea of extraction of the point of a sword, that can for sure be, you know, quote unquote,
5637000	5644680	fixed in the simple sense of acknowledging the originator of natural resources, goods, and services,
5645000	5653080	and cutting them into the economic deal. I mean, the fact that in Nigeria, they are a net exporter
5653640	5660280	of fossil fuels that then get refined, piped to Europe, refined and then sold back to them
5660280	5667400	at a profit. You're like, that's, that's horribly, horribly wrong. And Sierra Leone, there was a
5667400	5675720	very cool TED talk by a woman from Sierra Leone, being like, we're often, you know, labeled as one
5675720	5679720	of the poorest countries in Africa, et cetera. We're not. And she talked about, you know, their
5679720	5683160	mining assets, the diamonds, like all of these things, like here's our natural resources, we're
5683160	5690280	we actually massively gifted in those terms, we've just been totally exploited. So fixing
5690280	5696600	colonialism simply by not allowing rapacious multinational companies in cahoots with the IMF
5696600	5701560	and World Bank and debt leveraged, you know, extortion, setting up terms and conditions that
5701560	5707080	just siphon off natural resources. Let's just start with that. Never mind what would one do with 500
5707080	5711320	years of reparations, like that's probably politically, economically feasible, you know,
5711320	5717640	not feasible to sort in any meaningful way. But doing right by folks right now could be. And let's
5717640	5723960	start with that. And then with capitalism, and Daniel Schmackenberger, Daniel Schmackenberger
5723960	5730360	and I have actually had this conversation, because so many of his critiques lead to, oh,
5730360	5735640	this is a self terminating system. Therefore, you have to get politicians to stop doing it.
5735640	5739880	And I'm like, well, what politician in their right mind could say anything that you've just said,
5740600	5744440	and not instantly be branded as a Marxist and instantly lose their term and office,
5744440	5748440	and therefore all their access to influence, you know, so it would just be it would be career
5748440	5752440	suicide, and then they wouldn't be on team good guy being able to affect any change. So we have to
5752520	5759000	have something that splits the difference. And my personal feeling is that saying, you know,
5759000	5764920	like the rallying cry of free the market, free the market. Capitalism is a great idea. It's just
5764920	5771880	never been tried, right? It's always been monopolies, rent seeking, crony capitalism, subsidies,
5771880	5775800	you know, like, like whether it's lobbyists or whatever it is, like, like it's that we've never
5775800	5783480	actually had that, you know, classroom ideal of an economic a free love a frictionless
5783480	5787400	exchange of good services with with dynamic pricing reflecting needs and values and all
5787400	5792440	the things that you hear about an econ class have never actually been tried. So let's do that,
5792440	5796920	let's free the market. And that's kind of your judo move of getting both conservatives and
5796920	5801000	progressives on the same team, because you're not trying to break the entire system, you're just
5801000	5805560	saying let's actually do the thing we said we were going to. Let's start with let's let's not
5805560	5810120	even worry about universal basic income. Let's just have everybody pay their fair share.
5811160	5815000	So whatever the tax code is right now, it could be wildly asymmetrical, it could be regressive,
5815000	5818200	it could be a bunch of things, but right now there's so many loopholes and so many exceptions
5818200	5822280	for the wealthiest folks, let's just have everybody pay their fair share. Let's just start with that.
5823160	5828440	Let's abolish the 14th amendment, right, because the 14th amendment, which most people remember
5828440	5831080	from high school is like, Oh, that's the one that freed the slaves, isn't it? That's a good one.
5831080	5838280	You're like, Yeah, but weirdly, bizarrely, 20 years later, Leland Stanford, who founded Stanford
5838280	5845320	University, and his his railroad, his lawyers, trying to wiggle out of some taxes, completely
5845320	5850600	made up a complete fabrication that the 14th amendment really meant guaranteeing the rights
5850600	5854680	of personhood to corporations as well. It's the craziest story you've ever heard because
5855240	5860120	the Supreme Court has seen has judged like 280 cases or something since then,
5860120	5865960	defending the right of corporations as persons, and only like 30 on actually the rights of Black
5865960	5871960	folks as citizens. So it hijacked the entire thing, and has given us all of 20th and 21st
5871960	5878520	century law on how much political power corporations have. Right, so you've got to
5878520	5883240	banish, abolish that and the Friedman doctrine that the sole and exclusive responsibility
5883800	5889400	of corporations is to extract maximum shareholder profit. If you don't do those things,
5889400	5895880	you're dead in the water, right? Because the ratchets all go towards a governance system,
5895880	5901960	a capitalization table, legally enforceable incentives, and court of law. I mean, there's
5901960	5906440	situations now where because of that notion of corporations as persons, there are in
5906440	5913560	international courts, nations are being sued by multinational corporations for daring to enact
5913560	5918120	environmental policies that protect their streams, their rivers, their watersheds, their topsoil,
5918200	5923400	and their people at the expense of maximum optimized profitability for the multinational
5923400	5930040	corporation and the multinationals are winning. So you have situations like that and you're like,
5930040	5934680	okay, that's a stitch up. That's not actually, doesn't matter how many do-gooders, doesn't
5934680	5939080	matter how many, you know, Twitter campaigns or Instagrams, you know, social, you know, click,
5939080	5947000	click and click and like, and follow the activists. None of that can work if the rule of law is so
5947640	5951320	hijacked and compromised by these perverse incentives that are now legally enshrined.
5952200	5956600	So back to your original question, can this be done on an individual level versus on a collective
5956600	5964840	level? For sure, you know, we have to come from, you know, love, light, consciousness, inclusion,
5964840	5971160	hopefully some joy, hopefully some play, right? Some sense of this is worth doing together, right?
5971160	5978760	And there are absolutely technical, legal, structural conditions that until those are
5978760	5986680	dislodged, right, they will, they will block and undermine even the best of intentions.
5988680	5995160	That's a brilliant point. And I guess I lean more towards the individual side because I've
5995160	5998840	lately, I've lost so much faith in our institutions and our governments,
5999480	6005400	and I've seen the power of what an individual change can have on the world, you know, you
6005400	6011720	change yourself, you change the world. And so like, to the tribalism, to the capitalism, colonialism
6011720	6017160	on each of those levels, like, if the individual says, hey, I'm not, we're not going to support
6017160	6023080	any products that have this chemical in it, we're done. The market is going to have to adjust,
6023160	6027960	right? I mean, look how many people want organic food now, and are rejecting the pesticides.
6027960	6033080	There's a huge demand for products that don't have plastic anymore, because people are now aware of
6033080	6038280	how harmful phthalates are to our endocrine systems. You know, it's, it's because people are
6038280	6044200	getting more aware that it's putting this demand on the companies, and the market has to adjust to
6044200	6051080	that, that individual epiphany. And so you can apply that to colonialism and tribalism, like,
6051080	6056920	if you realize that we're all one, and that anything that I do to hurt another person
6056920	6062920	will hurt me in the end, and that by destroying the forest, I'm really just destroying myself.
6064440	6071000	Those deep understandings can kind of make tribalism and colonialism deteriorate, I think.
6071720	6077320	Maybe that's just like a, you know, that's a very utopian vision. But I do feel like I've seen
6077320	6084600	people who have become, I guess, enlightened, not to sound cliche. And I've seen how much they,
6084600	6088760	they step away from things that are harming the world, and how much good they can do,
6089640	6093160	just one person, and how that spreads throughout a community.
6095480	6101160	Yeah, absolutely. And to me, that almost lives in a, that lives in another and distinct and very,
6101240	6108360	very important category, which is, and it's what I literally, it was the central thesis of the last
6108360	6113400	book I wrote, Recapture the Rapture, which was, hey, look, all of our technical tactical solutions
6114120	6118280	probably aren't going to pencil out, right? We're trying, we're bargaining, we're hoping,
6118280	6121800	we're innovating, we're delaying, we're stalling, we're, you know, like all of it, like, it's just,
6121800	6128760	it's a shit show, and the math doesn't work. But, right, there is this thing that happens
6128760	6133240	once in a blue moon, and we talked about King Mandela Gandhi, but there's a lot of others,
6133240	6139240	right? Where singular isolated acts of human love, creativity, and courage. I mean,
6139240	6144840	Banksy is another example, like Banksy is just wildly on point almost all the time,
6144840	6150440	and he's an anonymous artist that just does street art. But he's always like, hey, he's kind of like
6150440	6156520	this cosmic prankster trickster, and he makes millions of humans think differently, right?
6156520	6161320	Think about Tankman in Tiananmen Square, right, where he just stood in front of the tanks, he
6161320	6165240	had shopping bags, he was tired, he just kind of come home from work, he didn't plan it, right?
6165240	6170520	He's just like, fuck this, right? And then he was whisked off, spirited away, like no one knows
6170520	6175080	what happened to him afterwards, and yet we all know who we're talking about, Tankman in Tiananmen
6175080	6181000	Square, right? The cellist of Sarajevo in the midst of the Yugoslavian Civil War with all sorts of
6181000	6186280	atrocities, in the bummed out rubble of Sarajevo, he just sat down on a chair and just played
6187480	6191240	every night at sunset, and the snipers on both sides didn't kill him.
6192360	6198920	Everybody was yearning for that glimpse of humanity, of beauty, in the midst of all of that
6199560	6208120	horror, right? And he changed the tide of things, however slightly. You know, the example I always
6208120	6213640	go back to is, you know, the band, you know, the band played on, on the Titanic, right? A string
6213640	6220840	quartet who didn't scrap for those remaining seats in the lifeboats. They let the women and children
6220840	6227880	go first, realized their goose was thoroughly cooked, and didn't just succumb to being panicky
6227880	6233080	scared people. They said, what is our Dharma? What are we here to do? What are we given our lives to?
6233080	6237240	And why were we here on this ship in the first place? It was because we are the musicians.
6238200	6241240	And so, you know, Buddhism 101, seek refuge in the Dharma.
6242200	6246120	They sought refuge in it, and the tune they played was, nearer my God to thee,
6248120	6251480	right? So at a time where they could have succumbed to self-interest, where they could have
6251480	6256920	been kicking and screaming, they could have been just in survival instincts. They instead
6256920	6261400	elevated up. And we might not remember their names, but we remember what they did,
6261720	6268680	and we tell those stories. You know, the more kind of agro macho one would be, you know,
6268680	6275400	King Leonidas on the Spartans at Thermopylae, right? Against the Persian hordes, you know,
6275400	6279960	and today, today we fight in the shade, right? Because there's that many arrows coming our way,
6279960	6287080	like those acts of courage and heroism. Gandhi called it Satyagraha, which means truth force,
6288040	6293320	when it made its way back to the United States via Howard Thurman to Martin Luther King, it became
6293320	6299720	soul force. And MLK even mentions that in his I Have a Dream speech. He says, well, we can meet,
6299720	6304360	when we can meet physical force through the majestic heights of soul force,
6305000	6309560	right? Then we have a chance to turn things on a dime. And so that thought being is like, well, what
6309560	6319800	if what if we could scale soul force? What if there are ways to have more humans, some tiny
6319800	6324760	critical mass of people on Erica Chenoweth at the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard has
6324760	6329240	famously pegged that at three and a half percent of a population, whether that's still true or
6329240	6333560	deeply true, or you know, will be will be true playing forward, don't know. But let's just say
6333560	6338680	we're not there yet. So let's get there and see how it looks from there. Right? What is the possibility
6338680	6346520	of three and a half percent of humans accessing their own truth force, their own soul force,
6346520	6353880	and then making just sending out that EMP of humanity, of courage, of truth,
6354760	6358360	and just bearing witness to it and then like and then let the chips fall, right? It's not that those
6358360	6363880	guys were fiddling on the Titanic in the hopes that the Coast Guard was going to hear them and
6363880	6370440	pick them up. Right? They're like soul force is is my life is forfeit. None of us get out of here
6370440	6381320	alive. I already I know this and accept it. Now what? Right? Now what? And that is where the beginning
6381320	6385720	of something profound could happen. I mean, you know, and on a very tactical example,
6385720	6389480	like a counterfactual, because you're like, Oh, three and a half percent of people being super
6389480	6391880	groovy. Is that really going to change things? You're like, Well, actually, look at what happens
6391880	6397320	when a tiny percentage of people are super shitty. So our friend Tristan Harris and Azar Askin at the
6397320	6401960	Center for Humane Tech, they did the social dilemma that big documentary on social media ills
6403800	6409880	found research that was basically saying that 90% of all social media of all generated social media
6409880	6419320	that all of us read is created by 5% of the people on the furthest extremes. So 90% of social media
6419320	6423400	is created by 10% of the humans, you know, half and half on either side of the political spectrum.
6423960	6429560	And a subsequent study down in Australia found that those folks that are on the far extremes
6430120	6435720	score off the charts for dark triad personality types and authoritarianism. So narcissism,
6435720	6443720	sociopathy, Machiavellianism and authoritarianism are the 10% of the humans generating 90% of what
6443800	6449240	we all read and view, which is absolutely insane because how many people scroll through their
6449240	6455240	social media are like, I hate humans. We're screwed. You know, I don't want to be a part of this
6455240	6460040	civilization or this society. It's a totally logical conclusion. It's just that it's not
6460600	6467320	the 90% of the humans in the middle. 90% of the humans in the middle want a chance to live
6467960	6472120	a better life than their parents had and give a better life to their kids and die in their sleep
6472120	6478360	surrounded by their grandchildren. Like that has always been what most of us want.
6479560	6487480	And so breaking through those false barriers, those algorithmically optimized notions of
6487480	6495240	separation and frustration and getting back to mutuality and connection where we see each
6495240	6500440	other's humanity and we recognize that there's something worth defending and protecting here
6501320	6505960	does feel super important. So to your question, like surely, hey, is there something about the
6505960	6511000	individual? It absolutely has to be done at this level. And there is something asymmetrically
6511000	6516600	different than I'm just going to yoga and using my breath work app and my headspace and my ice
6516600	6522120	bath. And this is all about me as a co-opted neoliberal capitalist consumer of late stage
6522120	6528280	capitalism, right? Like that version doesn't go anywhere. That is a that is a insidious
6528280	6533640	stall and diversion tactic of the people with the greatest privilege from their social civic
6533640	6540520	political responsibilities. But stepping into the deeper prospect of what happens if a bunch of us,
6541160	6545800	some critical mass of us actually access our soul force and take a stand and say enough is enough.
6546920	6549880	I am here to bear witness to the least of my brothers and sisters,
6551000	6555160	you know, on behalf of goodness, truth and beauty for as long as it takes.
6555560	6558760	That feels like a game with playing.
6561400	6567320	Absolutely. And I love how this conversation just flowed naturally. We we I haven't even gotten
6567320	6573080	to my first question that I wrote down. No way. But but I love how this has just been an organic
6573080	6577640	flow. The questions have just come naturally. But I think this leads into the first question
6577640	6583080	that I wrote down. I've seen a incredible rise in cynicism. And I spent a lot of my time reading
6583080	6588840	comments online. And it seems like that must suck. You know, I know it's a bad habit, but
6590520	6595560	a lot of the comments I get on my channel are very genuine. You know, they're not not trolls.
6596120	6600280	So I take most of them seriously into consideration. And, you know, I like,
6600920	6605240	I get a lot of positive comments on my channels. I think it's rare, because a lot of the comments,
6605960	6610920	a lot of the feedback is positive. But I've just just scrolling online, I see so much cynicism.
6611000	6615160	And just even in the titles of videos, everything's kind of like, let's take something that
6615800	6618360	most people think is good. And let's talk about how it's actually terrible.
6619320	6623880	And I feel like there's so many takes like, if you want to make a viral video that gets a lot of
6623880	6628280	attention, you just pick something that a lot of people think to be true. And then you say how
6628280	6635080	it's false. You know, if I made a video right now that said AI is actually past its prime, it's peaked.
6636040	6640920	Most people think that AI is advancing super fast. But if I make a take that's
6641480	6645400	the opposite to what most people think, even if it's completely unfounded,
6645960	6649960	that take is going to get a lot of attention. And I think a lot of content creators have
6650600	6655640	kind of figured out that hack. And so they're just, the internet is flooded with these
6656760	6664360	contrarian takes, you know what I'm saying? And I think it's led to people not knowing what's
6664360	6670760	true anymore. And the natural response is just cynicism. And cynicism has gotten confused with
6670760	6678680	intelligence. Like, even in movies, if you see somebody who's like, happy, go lucky, we think,
6678680	6685080	oh, that person must be ignorant. And the person that's always like, very skeptical is seen as
6685080	6690520	the intelligent one. So like this cynicism has been connected with intelligence and people,
6690600	6695720	their natural response now is just to, okay, let me just not trust anything. Let me just
6695720	6700440	think that everything's bad. Have you also noticed this rise in cynicism?
6701800	6710680	Yeah, so I mean, the symbol answer is, is for sure. It does feel like there is a spike in,
6711960	6717800	you know, nothing is true. Nothing is trustworthy. Even the thing, even our sacred cows,
6717800	6722600	that we used to sort of think we're up and above that, like Abraham Lincoln and Thomas Jefferson
6722600	6726840	and George Washington will actually turned out they were slaveholders or misogynists or something,
6726840	6730840	you know, something along those lines, like, is there any one, is there any thing? And again,
6730840	6737080	even back to, you know, enlightenment values, or the American experiment, you know, or whatever it
6737080	6745080	might be, there's somebody taking a sledgehammer or a chisel to all of our, you know, monuments,
6745080	6748680	to all of the edifices to the things that we have, we used to potentially, you know,
6749720	6754920	accept more at face value. And we had spoken a little bit earlier about how things are getting
6754920	6759400	exponentially better and exponentially worse at the same time. And that's overwhelming.
6760200	6764520	So at the same time, that just, you know, everything from the complexities and the
6764520	6769640	consequences of our current moment, which is just sort of objective, plus the massively
6769640	6773400	accelerated amount of information we all have access to through our super smart smartphones,
6773400	6776360	you know, constantly bombarding us at all times. And I read something that
6777000	6780680	basically a Sunday edition of the New York Times, just as thick as that is,
6781480	6785800	was as much information as a monk in the Middle Ages consumed in his lifetime.
6788040	6793400	And we're getting that before breakfast every day. You know, it's, it's, it's, it's
6793400	6799960	a certain bananas, right? So at the same time that we have this huge spike in both volume and
6799960	6806840	consequence of the information we're consuming, we've had a loss in our familiar landmarks.
6807880	6813080	And you can kind of say, you know, sort of meaning 1.0 was that notion of organized religion. And
6813080	6816920	that was your sacred scriptures and your priests and your community rabbis, you know, imams in
6816920	6820360	your community, they told you what was what they told you where you lived in the world and your
6820360	6823560	universe and how to be and what to do, et cetera, et cetera. And if there was something weird,
6823560	6827640	like a comet or a meteor or, you know, or a strange happening, you went to them and they
6827640	6833080	told you what to think about it. So that was our overwhelming and dominant source of information
6834280	6840680	until the last three, 400 years of increasingly the advent of modern liberalism and not meaning
6840680	6844840	Democrat, but just meaning that the Enlightenment experiment, the combinations of science,
6844840	6849240	of empiricism, of rule of law, of civil liberties and all of those kinds of things. And those are
6849240	6854760	the institutions like everything from the CDC and the WHO, right, to the World Bank, to the
6854760	6860120	United Nations, to, you know, Yale and Harvard and MIT and all of our institutions, to McKinsey
6860120	6867080	and Goldman Sachs, right, like all of those kind of icons. And, you know, for the first time ever,
6867080	6872840	we've had the collapse in both of those pillars at the same time that we're having this exponential
6872840	6879160	complexity. So we're more in need of trusted and trustworthy voices to tell us which ends up
6879880	6885800	at the same time that they've both collapsed. So the roof is kind of caved in on our separation of
6885800	6892600	church and state, kind of modern liberal secular societies. And into that vacuum, you're getting
6892600	6899080	people pulled to fundamentalism on one side, which is like, it's too big, it's too scary out there,
6899080	6904360	just give me something, anything to sink my teeth into, believe a rock to cling to, just tell me
6904360	6912600	what that might be. And on the other side, nihilism, like I give up, this is hopeless. There is no
6912600	6917480	there, there, we are just in a cyclic creation and destruction, there is no higher purpose or power,
6917480	6923400	there is no times arrow direction to where we're going. This is just more of the same shit. So
6923400	6928440	your naming of the cynicism, you can make a case, either you put that in that in the nihilism bucket,
6928440	6933000	it's just a flavor of that, right, or you could say that's somehow hanging out in the middle,
6933720	6940600	you know, where you are sort of perversely incented to kick down anything anyone believes,
6941480	6946520	right, because you have no faith that there's something more to be had. And cynicism and
6946520	6951640	hedonism, I think, often pair together, right? If there's nothing, if there's no other better
6951640	6957080	game to play, and I can go around kicking down everybody's sandcastles, then the only thing
6957080	6964120	left to do is for me to get mine, right, seek pleasure, avoid pain, you know, and that might
6964120	6969480	even be clicks and likes and trolling, that might be pleasurable to me. So, you know, and so that's
6969480	6976360	not just sort of an abstract theoretical model, right, is it predictive? Does it help its mind?
6976360	6981400	You're like, oh, look what's happening with fundamentalism, like not only are we seeing a
6981400	6986840	resurgence in that in organized religions, but you're seeing some weird ass hybrids, you're seeing,
6986840	6992200	you know, there was just a piece this about three months ago on the rise of orthobros,
6992840	6999720	right, which was Eastern Orthodox Christian, you know, sort of Joe Rogan, podcaster, guns and
6999720	7005480	steroid MMA guys, getting into Eastern Orthodoxy in Houston. So a huge, and they've even taken
7005480	7013880	over the Eastern Orthodox communities in Houston, Texas. And a colleague of ours, Isabella, Tara
7013880	7019080	Isabella Burton, who wrote a great book called Strange Rights, which is kind of everything from
7019080	7023080	Burning Man and Soul Cycle to all these weird expressions of religiosity in the contemporary
7023080	7030040	world. She's written in the New York Times about the the basically the return to extreme
7030040	7035240	orthodoxies in Catholic like folks like young people, millennials are going in New York City
7035240	7040520	are getting pulled into like Latin masses. They're like the older and the sort of more
7040520	7045000	code based. And the more tell me what to do, the more I'm going to get off on it. It's almost
7045000	7050920	like a sort of existential kink. It's a little bit like being a submissive in BDSM. It's like
7050920	7057480	I've just spent a decade all about me, clicking on insert posts, going to yoga retreats in Bali,
7057480	7062520	doing medicine ceremonies, like learning my attachment styles, you know, da da da healing
7062520	7069160	my ancestral trauma. And it is fucking exhausting. And I don't feel any better off at all. And all I
7069160	7075080	want is somebody to tell me what to think and what to believe. So you have even that from like
7075080	7079000	the progressive kind of New Age self help left, you have a return to people are just, you know,
7079000	7083560	and Russell Brand converted to Christianity. We have several other mutual friends that have
7083560	7089560	just recently come out and sort of stated their claim of returning to Christianity. Jordan Peterson
7089560	7097480	has been a voice of right kind of traditionalist classical values and meaning. Here's what's her
7097480	7103560	name. I hear some Ali, I think she might have a first name, but it's it's Nile Ferguson's wife
7103560	7111240	and partner. She very publicly recently left Islam altogether as her family of origin faith,
7111880	7118440	and converted to Christianity. So you're seeing, you know, and then throw in wing nut conspiracy
7118440	7123000	theories like QAnon. So those are all expressions of heightened fundamentalism. You're like,
7123000	7128600	yep, okay, that was the model seemed like if we don't have solid pillars to hold up our consensus
7128600	7135320	reality together, we're all fragmenting and fracturing. And then the nihilism side, you're
7135320	7145400	seeing that, you know, I think 50, maybe it was, I think it was 54% of Gen Z surveyed in the United
7145400	7150440	States by Pew Research Foundation concluded that they would they would find a military dictatorship
7150440	7156920	preferable to representative democracy. And you're like, whoa, okay, that's that's not something
7156920	7161560	that's been around for a long time. The recent European parliamentary elections have shown a
7161560	7169080	significant rightward shift. And it's getting into the kind of burn it all down territory,
7169080	7172600	where people are not, you know, you would used to think that like two parties didn't really matter
7172600	7176840	which side you were on, everybody would agree to play by the rules of this great nation we were
7176840	7182680	founded on or whatever, you know, or European cultures and governance traditions. And now you're
7182680	7189720	having many, many more people in the hashtag burn it all down category. This is marabund. This is
7189720	7193800	corrupt. This never should have happened in the first place, or it was a good idea, but it's
7193800	7197880	fatally tainted now. And the best thing to do is just bulldoze the whole thing. This is not a fixer
7197880	7203560	rapper. Right. This is buy it for the lot and scrape this thing and start again, C steadying
7203560	7208360	cryptocurrencies, all those guys have breakaway civilization ideas. And then how's it just
7208360	7215240	happening for most people, for most people that are pulled into the nihilism. It's just personally
7215240	7219800	and psychologically and emotionally overwhelming. So those folks aren't on Twitter, and they're
7219800	7223080	not hatching, you know, they're not hatching plans for breakaway societies or, you know,
7223080	7227880	or following Steve Bannon to some fascist retreat in the Italian Alps, right, those people are just
7227880	7235960	succumbing to diseases of despair, addiction, depression, anxiety, suicide. And so that is
7235960	7241480	what we're seeing at this point. And so the question is, is into that vacuum, we would expect
7241480	7251000	to see all sorts of cultic communities arise. Right. Give me a charismatic, demagogic leader,
7251000	7257800	give me someone who's pulling the juice, right, who has a certainty that is persuasive or compelling.
7258440	7262920	And that can promise me that all that I'm seeing and experiencing right now isn't,
7263480	7268600	isn't wrong or bad or my fault. There's someone or something to blame. There's always something
7268600	7276120	or someone to blame because that's the tribalism DNA. Right. And we can get to a happily ever after
7276120	7284280	if you only follow me, join us, do the thing, which is a rapturous ideology. Like the world,
7284280	7289720	you're right, the world is screwed up, it's fucked up, it's irredeemable. And we're coming
7289720	7294280	to an inflection point really soon where everything changes. Right. That could be the
7294280	7298200	revolution, that could be the rapture, it could be whatever it is. It could be artificial general
7298200	7303640	intelligence at some point soon, we can see it from here if we squint. It's coming. So get ready
7303640	7309800	and follow me because here's the deal on the other side of that inflection point. Us, our tribe,
7309800	7315960	we come up roses. We're actually better off on the other side. So let's get there as fast as possible.
7317320	7323880	Right. And hop on board. And those rapture ideologies, they show up in fundamentalist
7323880	7327800	religion, but they also show up in techno utopianism. They show up in Silicon Valley with Ray Cozwell
7327800	7335080	and Peter Diamandis and Mark Andreessen. Right. They show up in, the storm is coming and QAnon
7335080	7340680	stuff. Right. You see them everywhere. They show up in crypto, hodl, you know, like, and then there's
7340680	7346040	going to be some collapse in fiat currency and then everybody holding fat Bitcoin and ETH wallets
7346040	7351880	will come up roses and we'll have a debt jubilee and we'll reboot the entire global financial
7351880	7359640	systems. Right. Everybody's peddling some version of that. And they sell hope because they all
7359640	7365880	promise to leapfrog the train wreck that's in front of us. And the train wreck is much harder to sort
7365880	7371560	out. So it's like, well, we're not even going to sort it out. And in fact, our buddy Doug Rushkoff,
7371560	7377960	who wrote team human and doomsday prep for the super rich, even called it the mindset in Silicon
7377960	7383000	Valley in particular, because he was he was brought by like five hedge fund guys flown out to some
7383000	7387320	super secret desert compound and given tens of thousands of dollars to give a talk. And he thought
7387320	7391480	he was giving a real talk. And then he realized, oh, these guys, there's no one to talk to you. It's
7391480	7394840	not like they're whole stable of traders that he was here to talk to. It was just them. And they
7394840	7400680	wanted to grill him on the apocalypse. And he identified, which I thought was a brilliant move,
7400680	7405160	the mindset. And he called it with a capital M, the mindset. And the mindset is fundamentally,
7405240	7411800	you know, not unique to Silicon Valley, but ubiquitous in Silicon Valley of, hey,
7412600	7417240	never mind all these messy human problems, never mind our cultural history, never mind
7417240	7422840	our government, never mind rules and regulations, never mind any of that. We'll we'll we just want
7422840	7429960	a blank piece of paper to rebuild our utopian vision on. So we're not going to engage in humanity.
7429960	7434120	This is a bunch of sort of Asperger guys, you know, fundamentally, like,
7434120	7439800	under socialized, not especially well-mammaled, rarely in the company or the accountability
7439800	7445720	of a good strong woman, imagining these fictive scenarios where it's up and out.
7446920	7450760	And whether that's Mars or whether that's some, you know, real estate we bought in, you know,
7450760	7455160	inland, inland from the Bay Area and we're rebooting there or, you know, or it's, you know,
7455160	7463960	offshore or or it's wherever. And and that tends to be a situation that almost always
7465080	7469080	is a one percenter solution. However you slice the one percent, it could be
7469080	7473080	that worth, but it could be the morally elect or saved, it could be the intelligent and the
7473080	7476920	brilliant, it could be the holders of my certain crypto coin, it could be whomever,
7476920	7483320	but it's a one percenter play that leaves 99 percent of humanity and all the four-leggeds,
7483320	7486840	you know, and the winged and the finned and everybody, you know, all the other creatures on
7486840	7493960	this earth with the short end of that straw. So that's what brings us back to what are solutions,
7493960	7499960	what's a civilizational calculus that works for everyone, everywhere, everyone. All of us are
7499960	7507080	none of us, just as an ethical pledge. And this planet, you know, no fucking off to space if we
7508040	7515160	trashed Eden and we're trying to reconstruct habitable environments out of completely contrived
7515160	7521400	situations like not going to happen. These bodies, right, the idea of not becoming cyborgs,
7521400	7527800	actually honoring these beautiful organisms that we've been gifted with being self-aware within
7528680	7535080	and this lifetime, you know, not punting to life, indefinite life extension
7535720	7544680	for a fortunate few, but to say we fully embrace this human lifespan, we fully embrace this earth,
7544680	7553000	we fully embrace our bodies to take a stand for all of us, right? On behalf of the good,
7553000	7558040	the true and the beautiful, I mean, none of this is new, right? This is, if you think about
7559000	7565720	what we see on Instagram and TikTok these days, where we are constantly shouted at and whispered
7565720	7575160	at and promised and seduced to believe that you can have it all now in just three easy steps,
7576360	7583240	right? Like scan the world's wisdom traditions, scan every saint, sage, and philosopher that has
7583240	7589320	ever lived and left a mark in our collective consciousness and not a single one of them
7589320	7598840	has said anything remotely that juvenile, self-obsessed or perverse. You know, what have they said?
7598840	7605640	They've said, hey, life's a mixed bag, right? I mean, I defer to, there's that old, old Yeller,
7605640	7610520	was a famous Disney movie about a kid who adopts a dog. We actually listened to it as we were
7610520	7614200	moving our family to Austin. I'm like, oh, great. I remember old Yeller. We'll do a book on tape.
7614200	7617800	That'll be the road trip. As it turns out, of course, with all dog movies and all horse movies,
7617800	7621640	the dog doesn't make it. He gets, he defends them and he gets bitten by a wolf or a coyote.
7621640	7625640	He gets rabies. They have to put him down, right? So the sun is broken up, as were our kids in the
7625640	7630360	backseat. They're like, dad, we are never, ever listening to another book on tape about a dog
7630360	7635560	again. And the dad's sitting on the rocking chair on their, on their ranch house. And he's like, son,
7636440	7641720	the way I, the best, the way I figure it, you know, about half a life is good parts
7641720	7648440	and half a life is bad parts. But if you spend all the good parts worrying about all the bad parts,
7648440	7658040	why, then it's all bad. You know, and that's, that's St. Francis, Augustine, Buddha, Lao Tzu,
7658680	7663960	right? You know, like, they, they all acknowledge life's a bitch and then we die.
7665320	7670920	And then there's inevitably the, so what do we do about that in the in-between?
7671880	7678040	And my sense right now, and maybe we can, maybe we can even wrap with this, right,
7678040	7681960	is how to find hope. What, what is the antidote to cynicism, right? The antidote to cynicism is
7681960	7690520	a point on a purpose. And Joanna Macy, who's a Zen grandmother and, you know, one of the most
7691640	7699560	profound ecologists and activists of her generation, she's described our time in history,
7700280	7705560	right, as being the people of the passage. Like it is on us to get from here to there.
7706040	7711000	And if you think about the, you know, the settlement of the Western Hemisphere, like arguably through
7711000	7718360	the land bridge, right, between Asia and Alaska, Beringia, right? We are all Beringians now,
7719640	7727800	but in time, not space, right? So where like 15,000 Asian nomads shimmied across that in little boats
7727800	7732520	and, you know, on foot and in the ice ages and various bits and pieces to make it and populate
7732520	7738360	this entire half the world. We're doing that in time. Like there's a constraint coming. There's a
7738360	7744680	constraint coming, which is how do we transition off this hyper-consumptive, right, techno-industrial
7744680	7749880	cub and indulgent civilization, this complex dissipative structure, right, that's creating
7749880	7755960	entropy like nobody's business. How do we, how do we navigate that with a bloated population of
7755960	7761720	eight billion people, half of which would not exist? I mean, A, half of which happened in my lifetime,
7761720	7767800	right? We went from four billion to eight billion since the 70s. And at the same time,
7767800	7772600	half of the people alive, every single one of those new extra people only is here because we're
7772600	7779400	using fossil fuels as fertilizers and pesticides. So how do we do this? This is a complex dissipated
7779400	7784120	structure, this energy-hungry civilization that if we stop the energy inputs collapses. If it
7784120	7791080	collapses, that's curtains for so many of us and so much tragedy and suffering. So how do we leapfrog
7792520	7801000	from this situation to a lower carbon, higher energy, higher efficiency civilization that
7801000	7806760	protects and preserves us? So that's Jim and Macy's question. We're the people of the passage,
7807560	7813720	right? What is ours to do? How do we maintain hope, right? How do we die before we die,
7814760	7820120	right? So that we know our lives are forfeit. I'm no longer just a self-interested little monkey
7820120	7825320	seeking pleasure and avoiding pain. I realize my life is my offering. My life is my gift.
7825320	7832040	So that's step one. Step two, go from living as a fragmented, isolated little potted plant
7832760	7838840	of a deconditioned zoo animal, hyper neurotic consumer individual to taking my stand in a
7838840	7844360	stand of community and relations. How do I live seven generationally? How do I live on behalf of
7844360	7849720	my great-great grandparents who clearly busted us to get me this little ember that I've now fanned
7849720	7854440	into a flame? Do I get to say I'm sad or mad or disappointed? They didn't give me more. No,
7854440	7860680	they fucking gave me the emper and I'm now basking in a bonfire like amen. And my three generations
7860680	7865960	ahead of me, my children, my children's children, my children's children's children, how do I live
7865960	7871000	as part of that seven generations? And then to your point about what does life have a purpose,
7871000	7877160	does it have a point? It's both, right? Life is both cyclical and endlessly creating and destroying
7877160	7882840	and that is senseless and amoral and horrifying to contemplate from our point of view, where we
7882840	7889160	care deeply about our little part of things. And it's also a creative. Every single time that
7889160	7894840	cycle of creation and destruction happens, it spits out complexity. It spits out these novel,
7894840	7901960	rare, precious moments and we can anchor to them by ritual, seeking refuge and ritual,
7902680	7908200	mocking the seasons, mocking our lives, mocking our rites of passage, right? Noticing one of the
7908200	7913400	most profound ones I've seen was just a black and white photo of a Jewish family in Amsterdam
7913400	7919960	in 1941 celebrating Hanukkah. And you're like, oh man, like that was darkness. That was peak,
7919960	7925560	peak darkness of World War II. And there they were oppressed and hunted. And they were still
7925560	7931160	bearing witness to their lineage's rituals. Think of the Tibetan diaspora. Think of any
7931160	7937320	First Nation peoples that have been relocated. Think of the Rohingya, the Uighurs, right? The Kurds,
7937880	7942520	you know, the Roma, like there are fourth world peoples, peoples without a homeland,
7943240	7947400	right? That have been able to persist by carrying their rituals. So this is what it means to be
7947400	7952200	the people of the passage. And if we can do those three things, right? If we can die before we die,
7952200	7956920	so we know what's ours to give, we can live seven generationally. So that stretches out our sense
7957240	7963480	of what if I don't get mine? No. Oh, it's okay. Because I'm doing something on behalf of those
7963480	7969720	yet to be. And we seek refuge and ritual. We anchor the insanity and the constant slipstream
7970280	7977400	towards entropy with observing the passages. And then finally, what does that allow us to do?
7977400	7982920	It allows us to leave space for grace. Because none of us know how this is going to turn out.
7982920	7990280	And that's Thanos's pathology, right? Thanos is right up to the point where he is 100% certain
7991240	7996760	of how it's all going to turn out. And therefore that justifies his murderous behavior. We can never
7996760	8007480	be sure. There's a great quote I heard recently, which is we control nothing. We influence everything.
8008440	8017160	And we have no idea, right, where those ripples will go. So by leaving space for grace, like,
8017160	8021640	do we know how this all turns out? No, none of us could possibly know how it all turns out. But one
8021640	8030200	thing is certain. If we give up hope now, then hope has no chance. If we hold on to radical hope,
8030200	8035160	which is a very, it's actually, it's not just an adjective or a superlative, it's an academic term
8035880	8039000	from Jonathan Laird at the University of Chicago, who studied 19th century Indian
8039000	8043400	reservations. And radical hope is a specific definition. It's having hope for a future you
8043400	8051240	cannot see from here, but commit to nonetheless. So leaving space for grace, right, is the
8051240	8057640	butterfly effect. Time soul force at the end of time for all the models.
8058040	8066840	That's brilliant. And I'd like to read a quote to you from my favorite movie, Lord of the Rings,
8066840	8072040	that I think it just kept coming up in this conversation. And especially now,
8072680	8075640	we're at the end of two towers. You've seen Lord of the Rings, right?
8076600	8081800	Oh, dude, I did my senior thesis in high school on Lord of the Rings. I've been way in the pudding.
8081800	8086600	We ran a camp called Rivendell long before the movies came out. Oh, my God, that sounds amazing.
8086600	8093560	So at the end of two towers, when all hope seemed to be lost, Sam says to Frodo, it's all wrong
8093560	8098760	by rights. We shouldn't even be here. But we are. It's like in the great stories, Mr. Frodo,
8098760	8103720	the ones that really mattered, full of darkness and danger they were. And sometimes you didn't
8103720	8108440	even want to know the end, because how could the end be happy? How could the world go back to
8108440	8113800	the way it was before so much bad happened? But in the end, it is only a passing thing,
8113800	8119960	this shadow. Even darkness must pass. A new day will come. And when the sun shines, it will
8119960	8124760	shine out the clearer. Those were the stories that stayed with you, that meant something.
8125480	8132040	Even if you were too small to understand why. But I think, Mr. Frodo, I do understand. I know now.
8132920	8136680	Folk in those stories had lots of chances of turning back, only they didn't,
8136680	8139560	because they were holding on to something. And then Frodo says,
8140360	8145160	what were they holding on to, Sam? And he says that there's something good in this world,
8145160	8151800	Mr. Frodo, and it's worth fighting for. And so like, when you told me about the family
8151800	8156920	celebrating Hanukkah in 1941, in the midst of World War II, they're being hunted.
8157960	8164440	You know, it's like in the darkest night, they held on to that little flame, and that got them
8164440	8170120	through the deep dark. You know, you got to hold on to something. You got to find some
8170120	8176360	little shred of good in this world, and hold on to it, and that'll get you through anything. And
8178440	8181720	you know, it's like the night is the coldest just before dawn.
8183080	8186680	Which if you spend any time in the mountains, is you know, like you're literally waiting for
8186680	8193160	the sun to come up to get some sleep. Yeah, yeah, so no matter how bad things seem,
8194040	8197240	it'll pass. And you just got to hold on to what is good.
8198920	8205160	Well, you know, to riff on the Tolkien stuff, that notion of leaving space for grace, because
8205160	8211320	like we don't know how it's going to turn out, isn't simply the kind of Hollywood version of a
8211320	8215400	story of like, oh, it's climactic, and we don't know. And then finally Rocky comes back with the
8215400	8220760	final punch and wins the belt, you know, like that kind of a thing. Because if you think about,
8220760	8227000	I mean, I think it's so brilliant how Tolkien did this, right? Because how does, against all
8227000	8235080	overwhelming odds of Mordor and darkness, how does light prevail? Right? Light prevails in Lord
8235080	8244280	of the Rings through the perverse actions of Golan. And, and somewhere earlier, I think Sam,
8244280	8248760	you know, Sam hates Golan, right? And he's in that constant back and forth with Frodo.
8249480	8255800	And Sam wants to kill him. And Gandalf intervenes. And he says he may yet have a part to play.
8255800	8259160	Oh, Frodo wants to kill him. Oh, does he? Okay.
8259160	8262680	In the beginning. Yeah. In the first one, Frodo wants to kill him. And Gandalf says that.
8262680	8268360	Yes. Okay. Thank you. So first, so yes, the Hobbits want to kill Golan, who's Smeagol,
8268360	8272280	who is arguably, I mean, you know, I think there's a new film now coming out is going to pack a
8272280	8276120	bunch of this, but like, right. I mean, he was a Hobbit like device before he gets completely
8276120	8280360	warped by the ring. So it's in some respect, it's the Hobbit's shadow self, right? And they want to
8280360	8288760	kill him. Gandalf says, hey, wait, he may still. So the, the, the simplistic version of that would
8288760	8295480	be, oh, we show him love and compassion. And then Smeagol triumphs over Golan, right? And we now
8295480	8299720	integrate him into the light and he's on team good guy and he does something good for us. No,
8299800	8306360	that's not what happens, right? In the crux, not even Frodo stays true to his higher nature. The
8306360	8316360	ring bends everyone. Smeagol collapses entirely into his Golan self. And they are struggling
8316360	8324360	shadow to shadow and that somehow with the biting off of Frodo's finger, right? And Golan falling
8324360	8333320	into Mount Doom, that's what saves it. And that kind of impossible ambiguity, right, still delivering
8333880	8340360	redemption to me is one of the best lessons for us because it's not a happily ever after
8340360	8347080	simplistic heroic arc. It's not where good is rewarded with good and bad and evil is punished.
8347080	8354200	It's a wildly ironic ending, right? But the leaving space for grace, which is what Gandalf
8354200	8360600	was taking a stand for back before he possibly had any idea what that might mean, right? It's
8360600	8368200	the commitment to that that then saves Middle Earth. And that I think is one of the most
8369320	8373960	powerful lessons for all of us because again, from time to time, we're going to be facing or
8373960	8379560	not even from time to time, probably increasingly, we will be facing a litany of news that simply
8379560	8386600	doesn't pencil out. And the kind of whistling past the graveyard hope, you know, is simply going to
8386600	8396280	be inadequate. So we have to be able to anchor to something deeper and more enduring. And I think
8396280	8403400	Gandalf's lesson is a beautiful one for all of us. Absolutely. Well, on that note, I think this
8403400	8408920	podcast has gone amazing right from the beginning. You were just on fire. I like the podcast where
8409000	8417880	I don't have to talk much. For me, if I talk like less than 1%, that's great. But this was amazing.
8417880	8424120	And I'm sure there's going to be lots of great clips to extract from this. And thanks for taking
8424120	8430040	the time. Dude, I mean, I'm happy to, you know, just continue this conversation, you know,
8430040	8436280	on and off screen, however it makes sense. But I think there's tons of overlap in the things you're
8436280	8441160	curious about and care about and the stuff that, you know, the trees we're barking at as well. So
8442200	8448600	so much overlap. It's kind of shocking, like all the names you were saying are people that I've been
8448600	8452920	curious about. And the books you were mentioning were ones that I like, I feel like if we were two
8452920	8457400	planets, we're like, our orbits are kind of like getting pretty close to each other.
8458920	8463000	Totally. Yeah. Totally totally. All right, Mike. Awesome. Thanks for the time.
