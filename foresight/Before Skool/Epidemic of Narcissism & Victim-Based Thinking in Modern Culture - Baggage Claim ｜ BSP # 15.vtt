00:00.000 --> 00:10.000
Today, we have an awesome guest, the creator of Baggage Claim.

00:10.000 --> 00:11.000
Welcome.

00:11.000 --> 00:12.000
Hi.

00:12.000 --> 00:13.000
Hi, Mark.

00:13.000 --> 00:14.000
How are you?

00:14.000 --> 00:15.000
Good.

00:15.000 --> 00:16.000
How are you?

00:16.000 --> 00:17.000
Good.

00:17.000 --> 00:18.000
Thanks for having me.

00:18.000 --> 00:19.000
Of course.

00:19.000 --> 00:20.000
I love your channel.

00:20.000 --> 00:21.000
And I find it so refreshing.

00:21.000 --> 00:25.640
And on Baggage Claim, you talk about cultural issues, but you take a really nice philosophical

00:25.640 --> 00:29.240
approach to them and, you know, it's so confusing.

00:29.240 --> 00:31.520
We live in such a time of chaos.

00:31.520 --> 00:36.400
And to hear your take has been just refreshing as the word that comes to mind.

00:36.400 --> 00:37.400
Thank you so much.

00:37.400 --> 00:39.000
And I feel the same way about after school.

00:39.000 --> 00:42.080
I absolutely love your channel, consume everything.

00:42.080 --> 00:49.440
And I've been very inspired by how you, you have these takes where you'll draw really

00:49.440 --> 00:54.040
good parallels without actually mentioning the particular issues that you're talking

00:54.040 --> 00:55.040
about.

00:55.040 --> 00:58.240
And I think in that way, you make your videos so timeless and universal.

00:58.240 --> 01:02.800
So that's actually really been inspiring me to, to be better at doing that.

01:02.800 --> 01:04.360
Oh, well, thank you.

01:04.360 --> 01:08.600
That means a lot, especially coming from you, great creator.

01:08.600 --> 01:14.500
So yeah, before we, this video will come out right after our collaboration comes out.

01:14.500 --> 01:16.160
So we can talk about that.

01:16.160 --> 01:21.320
But first I'd love to hear about just what were you doing before you started your channel?

01:21.320 --> 01:22.320
Sure.

01:22.320 --> 01:29.120
I, for a better part of a decade, I've been working in the startup space.

01:29.120 --> 01:31.960
And so doing something completely else, that's not really where I started.

01:31.960 --> 01:36.480
I started off as an accountant and then slowly got entered into startups.

01:36.480 --> 01:39.080
I was inspired by my brother to move up to the Bay Area.

01:39.080 --> 01:44.120
I used to live in Los Angeles before that and then moved to the Bay Area and really

01:44.120 --> 01:49.980
enjoyed that aspect of sort of learning on the job, you know, at a startup, you kind

01:49.980 --> 01:53.060
of wear multiple hats, you have to do whatever it takes.

01:53.060 --> 01:56.500
So I learned a lot, but I kept kind of missing something.

01:56.500 --> 02:01.220
I kept feeling like there was a part of me that just kind of realized that I was not

02:01.220 --> 02:03.260
really meant for the job.

02:03.260 --> 02:07.340
In a lot of ways, I'm, I wasn't really enjoying it.

02:07.340 --> 02:08.620
It felt very forced.

02:08.620 --> 02:13.620
I was kind of forcing myself into this particular mold of being this big exec.

02:13.620 --> 02:18.940
I had this, you know, big dreams of, of that I was going to be this big executive.

02:18.940 --> 02:23.740
And the more I got into it, the more unhappy I became.

02:23.740 --> 02:29.260
And so I finally sort of got to that point, I think around the 30 mark, I've heard a lot

02:29.260 --> 02:33.340
of people share similar stories where you stop trying to force yourself into being something.

02:33.340 --> 02:37.300
You finally just acknowledge what you are and what you could be if you stopped trying

02:37.300 --> 02:39.020
to force things.

02:39.020 --> 02:43.020
And I just reached that point and I said, you know, I don't want to do this anymore.

02:43.020 --> 02:45.540
I was fantasizing about YouTube videos.

02:45.540 --> 02:52.700
I was thinking a lot about, uh, about, uh, you know, I was thinking in video essay form.

02:52.700 --> 02:54.340
And I said, okay, I think it's time.

02:54.340 --> 02:56.180
I think it's time to, to leave all that.

02:56.180 --> 03:01.020
And it was a good time because 2020 happened, you know, all the madness that happened with

03:01.020 --> 03:02.020
2020.

03:02.020 --> 03:05.340
And it was a good time to take a pause and step back because everybody was kind of separated

03:05.340 --> 03:06.340
out anyway.

03:06.340 --> 03:09.660
So there wasn't enough distraction of the world.

03:09.660 --> 03:13.620
And that's when I came up with the concept of baggage claim.

03:13.620 --> 03:21.820
And it, I was motivated by wanting to talk about, uh, issues, personal issues, professional

03:21.820 --> 03:27.700
issues, psychological issues that people might have on an individual level, but also culturally,

03:27.700 --> 03:30.340
what are things that we can't sort of see eye to eye on?

03:30.340 --> 03:32.140
And where can we meet in the middle?

03:32.140 --> 03:35.140
Because things were becoming more and more polarized, more and people were getting angrier

03:35.140 --> 03:36.980
and angrier and angrier.

03:36.980 --> 03:40.140
And, um, being in, you know, I'm, I'm based in San Francisco.

03:40.140 --> 03:46.220
So being in San Francisco, things just over the last 10 years just became so polarized.

03:46.220 --> 03:53.540
And my opinions that I thought were perfectly acceptable before were suddenly completely

03:53.540 --> 03:58.300
being ostracized, especially I had to be really, really quiet in professional settings or

03:58.300 --> 04:02.740
people were making assumptions about how I think politically, just based on the color

04:02.740 --> 04:05.260
of my skin or my gender.

04:05.260 --> 04:10.340
And so I found those instances very strange and I said, this is, this, this can't be the

04:10.340 --> 04:11.620
future of our society.

04:11.620 --> 04:14.660
We have to be headed in a better place.

04:14.660 --> 04:21.100
And so, and that's what really inspired me to, to start thinking about, about what I

04:21.100 --> 04:24.820
could be contributing to that conversation.

04:24.820 --> 04:26.060
Hmm.

04:26.060 --> 04:33.460
So you basically got so uncomfortable in that startup environment that it pushed you to

04:33.780 --> 04:35.660
express your creativity.

04:35.660 --> 04:40.060
That story really resonates with me because I have, I had a similar thing where you feel

04:40.060 --> 04:45.460
like you're just a cognitive machine and you feel like you're not being able to be creative.

04:45.460 --> 04:49.180
And that's kind of what people are put on earth to do is be creative.

04:49.180 --> 04:53.940
And if you're not doing that, you, you just, you feel completely inauthentic and it's almost

04:53.940 --> 04:56.900
like you have a psychological death.

04:56.900 --> 05:01.100
And so now are you doing a baggage claim full time?

05:01.100 --> 05:02.100
Yes.

05:02.100 --> 05:03.100
Full time.

05:03.100 --> 05:07.060
And so just, you know, what you said, I also found that so much of my work, because I never

05:07.060 --> 05:09.660
really thought of myself as a very creative person.

05:09.660 --> 05:12.860
Even though I used to write a lot of stories when I was a kid, I just didn't think of myself

05:12.860 --> 05:13.860
like that.

05:13.860 --> 05:19.020
And my role just became sort of babysitting a lot of people, making sure that they did

05:19.020 --> 05:20.020
their job.

05:20.020 --> 05:25.300
That kind of became my everyday job was, Hey, can you make sure that people meet their deadlines?

05:25.300 --> 05:29.940
And I found that to be such a strange idea that there was no self governance for a lot

05:29.940 --> 05:33.900
of people and they would find reasons to justify not getting their work done.

05:33.900 --> 05:39.940
And, and I was just going around chasing things down and, and people, people were very kind

05:39.940 --> 05:45.020
about, you know, pushing this narrative that I'm, oh, I'm the woman who gets shit done.

05:45.020 --> 05:50.180
You know, that was kind of the tagline under my slack was, you know, she gets shit done.

05:50.180 --> 05:54.620
And, and yet I found, well, why, why am I doing that?

05:54.620 --> 05:57.140
Is that really helping people at the end of the day?

05:57.140 --> 05:59.140
Is that actually contributing anything positive?

05:59.180 --> 06:02.740
I just felt like a, I just felt kind of like a fetcher of sorts.

06:02.740 --> 06:04.900
So, you know, it's, it's what you're saying.

06:04.900 --> 06:08.940
It's that psychological death because you're actually not being as productive as you could

06:08.940 --> 06:09.940
be.

06:10.940 --> 06:13.060
Well, you are definitely getting shit done on your channel.

06:14.140 --> 06:15.140
Yeah.

06:16.940 --> 06:23.660
So I've been really hyper focused on the issues that you talk about on your channel, because

06:24.660 --> 06:28.860
movies in particular seem to be at the center of the culture war now.

06:28.860 --> 06:29.860
Yes.

06:29.860 --> 06:35.460
And it seems like our modern movies have been overtaken by some sort of rot within.

06:36.460 --> 06:43.660
And I've been really into channels like critical drinker and nerd Roddick and your channel.

06:45.540 --> 06:50.860
And I'm curious to know like your answer is just why are modern movies failing to connect

06:50.860 --> 06:51.860
with audiences?

06:52.860 --> 06:59.620
I think, honestly, analyzing that question ends up answering a bigger question around

06:59.620 --> 07:02.780
what's wrong with society in general.

07:02.780 --> 07:07.820
And it could be perfectly summed up with we are caught up in this pursuit of the overly

07:07.820 --> 07:10.100
simplistic approach.

07:10.100 --> 07:17.660
I think if you think about the appeal of going the simple route is because it's possible

07:17.660 --> 07:20.100
today because of the advent of social media.

07:20.140 --> 07:26.900
So if I have a particular opinion, if I take it online, I could put that out there and

07:26.900 --> 07:30.020
immediately get likes, whatever that opinion might be.

07:30.020 --> 07:37.100
So I can build up a reputation pretty easily by minimal effort and just say things that

07:37.100 --> 07:42.740
are particularly popular or, you know, rile people up, whatever, whatever my base level

07:42.740 --> 07:44.660
goal might be.

07:44.700 --> 07:53.860
And that sort of thinking has really translated into movie making because to make a good movie,

07:53.860 --> 07:55.260
it takes a lot of work.

07:55.260 --> 07:56.980
It takes so much effort.

07:56.980 --> 07:59.220
And this is something Chris Gore talked about.

07:59.220 --> 08:03.740
He and I were messaging back and forth about this a couple of weeks ago.

08:03.740 --> 08:09.700
And someone who wrote for his website Film Threat talked about that there's this perception

08:09.700 --> 08:12.980
that movie making is actually really simple and anyone can do it.

08:12.980 --> 08:20.460
And there's like a form of jealousy, but also this marginalization of the effort.

08:20.460 --> 08:25.580
And there's not that realization that to put something together, that's a good narrative,

08:25.580 --> 08:32.420
you know, good structure, good, a good heart to it, good dialogue even takes a lot of thought,

08:32.420 --> 08:38.900
takes a lot of experience, a lot of consternation, a lot of collaboration to come up with something

08:38.900 --> 08:40.700
like that.

08:40.700 --> 08:48.420
And that's not really the approach that modern writers that have gotten into these writer

08:48.420 --> 08:53.060
rooms because they meet certain diversity criteria.

08:53.060 --> 08:55.300
They don't think like that.

08:55.300 --> 09:07.340
And a lot of the identity politics is rooted around that belief that ability is not really

09:07.940 --> 09:12.140
something that can be achieved through effort.

09:12.140 --> 09:17.740
Ability is inherent to your experience or, you know, you're the color of your skin.

09:17.740 --> 09:23.340
So for example, and I was talking about this on NerdRotix channel last week that there's

09:23.340 --> 09:30.940
that belief that a woman who checks certain boxes has something really unique to say.

09:30.940 --> 09:36.740
Because if you I don't know if you know, but Disney released a new TV show called Echo,

09:36.740 --> 09:42.740
and it's it hits it's like the intersectional gold mine, so to speak, because the main character

09:42.740 --> 09:50.700
Maya is a woman, she's indigenous, she's deaf, and she is an amputee.

09:50.700 --> 09:57.780
So she just hits so many, you know, checked boxes that all the people have to sort of

09:57.780 --> 10:03.740
step back and bow down and say, you know, this woman's going to offer us an understanding

10:03.740 --> 10:08.640
that's going to be so unique that nobody's ever, you know, could could even perceive what

10:08.640 --> 10:13.580
she might have to say or if she, you know, if she can't speak but represent.

10:13.580 --> 10:19.980
And that is just such a falsehood of belief that we are all so individually unique.

10:19.980 --> 10:23.540
It's that idea of saying like everybody's special and such a and everybody has such

10:23.540 --> 10:25.300
a unique thing to do.

10:25.300 --> 10:33.580
The thing is everybody has value to add, but we are a lot more similar than we are different.

10:33.860 --> 10:40.140
What makes a story good is when it speaks to universal truths that hit close to home

10:40.140 --> 10:46.660
that can actually, you know, they actually get to your heart, not because you look a

10:46.660 --> 10:52.020
certain way or you you you have a certain background, but it's because of the universal

10:52.020 --> 10:54.100
human experience.

10:54.100 --> 11:00.180
And this past weekend when I was watching I was watching the behind the scenes for Lord

11:00.220 --> 11:05.540
of the Rings, which is the greatest trilogy of all time created of all time.

11:05.540 --> 11:09.220
And I love watching the behind the scenes more than even sometimes watching the movie.

11:09.220 --> 11:17.740
I like watching the behind the scenes because it shows you the Herculean effort that a lot

11:17.740 --> 11:21.620
of people put for a better part of 10 years.

11:21.620 --> 11:29.820
And if you look at the entire sort of like vast variety of like production and cast from

11:29.860 --> 11:35.300
top to bottom, everybody poured their soul into that that piece of work.

11:35.940 --> 11:41.140
And I love seeing that because that's what art takes.

11:41.140 --> 11:46.460
As you know, you know, that's what art takes is that it takes almost everything out of

11:46.460 --> 11:51.940
you for you to create something beautiful, something that a lot of people can identify

11:51.940 --> 11:55.340
with. And I don't mean identify in the identity perspective.

11:55.380 --> 12:01.060
I mean, from the humanist experience perspective, and you see that that, you know, Peter Jackson

12:01.060 --> 12:05.340
set the tone of the main push behind that whole project.

12:05.580 --> 12:10.700
And everyone followed suit, all the production people, all the artists, you know, they even

12:10.700 --> 12:17.300
thought about that the cultural significance of what it means to be from Rohan and how

12:17.300 --> 12:22.100
significant horses would be and where, you know, farmland would be placed.

12:22.100 --> 12:25.780
They thought about all those little details versus what would it be like for Gondor?

12:26.020 --> 12:30.780
I mean, that's how how much that they really put put thought into that.

12:30.780 --> 12:36.060
And it showed, even if you didn't catch every little detail, it showed in the project as a whole.

12:36.300 --> 12:42.620
And it transformed all of their lives, the art and their their willingness to engage

12:42.620 --> 12:47.580
with that art, transform their lives, but it transformed so many millions and millions

12:47.580 --> 12:51.620
of people watch that and continue and will continue forever to watch that and be

12:51.620 --> 12:52.860
transformed for it by it.

12:53.220 --> 13:00.020
And I don't enjoy that movie or that story because there's, you know, a brown

13:00.020 --> 13:07.380
girl who's happens to be Indian and an immigrant and is, you know, has has black hair

13:07.380 --> 13:09.980
and is nearsighted is in that movie.

13:10.260 --> 13:13.580
What value does that add to me?

13:14.020 --> 13:18.020
You know, and it's a very that's a very narcissistic perspective to say, I need the

13:18.020 --> 13:21.460
hero that's accomplishing great things to look just like me.

13:22.180 --> 13:26.900
That's such a that's such a surface level way to engage with a movie.

13:26.900 --> 13:29.500
But that's what modern movie makers really expect.

13:29.820 --> 13:30.420
And what is that?

13:30.420 --> 13:31.740
It comes back to that same idea.

13:32.020 --> 13:38.420
That's the easy thing to do and say, you should enjoy this movie because the

13:38.420 --> 13:40.020
heroine looks like you.

13:40.260 --> 13:44.140
And that's what the entire promotion for Echo was exactly that.

13:44.180 --> 13:47.060
It was our main character is deaf.

13:47.100 --> 13:48.020
Our main character is deaf.

13:48.060 --> 13:49.260
It's she's indigenous.

13:49.260 --> 13:49.860
She's this.

13:49.860 --> 13:50.820
She's body positive.

13:50.820 --> 13:51.220
She's this.

13:51.500 --> 13:57.620
It's just all these little things that are so easy to do is the main promotion of

13:57.620 --> 14:00.100
that TV of that TV show.

14:00.500 --> 14:06.180
But the actual value that's that someone might be able to get to see a story that

14:06.180 --> 14:10.100
transcends time, that transcends space, but speaks to that human experience of what

14:10.100 --> 14:12.020
does it take to do something really hard?

14:12.300 --> 14:15.460
Lord of the Rings, what does it take to do a really difficult task?

14:15.980 --> 14:17.340
And how does it change you?

14:17.340 --> 14:21.660
How does it, how does it, what does it mean to go up against evil?

14:21.980 --> 14:25.740
And how can that evil touch your heart and almost destroy you, almost kill you in

14:25.740 --> 14:26.500
that process?

14:26.860 --> 14:30.660
I mean, that's the human story that a lot of people connect with.

14:32.180 --> 14:38.740
And so I think that's really the problem is that there's not that willingness to

14:38.740 --> 14:45.380
do the hard thing because there's a lack of recognition that that it's even

14:45.380 --> 14:46.220
worth the doing.

14:46.540 --> 14:47.860
It's like, just take the easier route.

14:48.580 --> 14:50.100
Just go for representation.

14:50.540 --> 14:54.380
And that's, and there's a whole group of people that are reinforcing that

14:54.380 --> 14:57.140
perspective amongst those writer rooms.

14:59.820 --> 15:00.980
Wow, you just said it all.

15:01.380 --> 15:04.700
You just hit so many different things that I want to talk about.

15:05.260 --> 15:09.940
Um, and I think at the core of it, the, the writing is, is really falling off a

15:09.940 --> 15:13.180
cliff and they don't have anything new to say.

15:13.540 --> 15:15.140
They're not telling any new stories.

15:15.980 --> 15:17.900
They're not speaking to these universal truth.

15:18.580 --> 15:23.740
And perhaps that's why they're so focused on these materialistic identity

15:23.740 --> 15:29.300
things, because if you take that identity aspect away from it, what is it?

15:29.300 --> 15:31.860
It's just an empty, there's nothing behind that.

15:32.540 --> 15:36.340
So perhaps that's why they are pushing that so hard because that's the only

15:36.340 --> 15:37.740
new thing they're bringing to the table.

15:38.900 --> 15:42.140
Otherwise it's like, well, why are you making this movie that nobody asked for?

15:43.020 --> 15:47.420
We're making it because the genitalia of the new care of the main character is

15:47.420 --> 15:47.740
different.

15:47.780 --> 15:50.060
That's why we have to remake this $300 million movie.

15:50.780 --> 15:54.060
And it's like, okay, I guess if it's that important to you, I guess it's worth

15:54.060 --> 15:58.740
remaking, but I love that you spoke about Lord of the Rings because that's

15:59.180 --> 16:00.620
my favorite movie by far.

16:01.300 --> 16:06.180
And I think I've literally watched that same behind the scenes video and I

16:06.180 --> 16:08.780
can't watch Lord of the Rings without pointing out like, you don't want to

16:08.780 --> 16:12.540
watch Lord of the Rings with me because I'm going to be like, Viggo Mortensen

16:12.540 --> 16:15.020
broke his foot in this scene, you know, he broke his toe.

16:15.540 --> 16:18.740
That's the first thing I thought I was like, you know, I think the same thing.

16:18.740 --> 16:19.100
Yeah.

16:19.340 --> 16:20.340
Like, did you know?

16:20.420 --> 16:20.900
Yeah.

16:22.100 --> 16:22.340
Yeah.

16:22.340 --> 16:23.140
I'm in the same way.

16:23.900 --> 16:27.180
Lord of the Rings is so deep and so good.

16:27.180 --> 16:28.940
It's such a, it's a symmetrical story.

16:28.980 --> 16:32.820
You have like nine members of the fellowship and then you have these nine

16:32.820 --> 16:36.860
Nazgul who are like the shadow side of them chasing them and then you have the

16:36.860 --> 16:39.260
good wizard and then you have the dark wizard.

16:39.820 --> 16:42.780
And then you have like elves and dwarves that contradict each other.

16:43.340 --> 16:47.340
And then the Urukay, the orcs are like literally dark elves.

16:47.340 --> 16:50.180
They are like dug up from the earth and they are elves.

16:50.180 --> 16:56.860
So it's like, it's almost like a perfect symmetrical psychological mind, the story.

16:56.860 --> 16:58.780
It's like, there's a dark side and there's a light side.

16:59.220 --> 17:01.940
And without the dark side, what is the Shire?

17:02.020 --> 17:05.820
The Shire is like nothing without the dark side, but because the dark is so dark

17:05.820 --> 17:11.260
in that story, the good is so good, you know, that the anti-hero defines the heroes.

17:12.140 --> 17:16.980
And, um, I never thought about it that way, I never thought about it that way.

17:16.980 --> 17:18.660
I never thought about the symmetry.

17:18.740 --> 17:19.740
That's very interesting.

17:19.740 --> 17:21.140
That's, and so true.

17:21.340 --> 17:22.740
I never, I never looked at it that way.

17:22.980 --> 17:25.500
Really good stories have great symmetry.

17:25.940 --> 17:28.340
Like I've, I've been rewatching Breaking Bad.

17:29.100 --> 17:34.540
And that story is very similar because Walter White is sick and he's kind

17:34.540 --> 17:38.620
of dying, he's on his way out, but at the same time, his wife is pregnant.

17:38.660 --> 17:39.860
She's bringing life in.

17:40.420 --> 17:42.660
So you have this nice symmetry to the story.

17:42.660 --> 17:49.380
You have his son in the above world, which is the, his son with his wife.

17:49.380 --> 17:52.420
And then he has his son in the dark world, which is Jesse.

17:53.540 --> 17:58.900
It's, um, and then every character in the dark world has good qualities.

17:59.100 --> 18:03.860
And every character in the above world has these dark qualities, like his

18:03.900 --> 18:07.700
sister-in-law steals, you know, everybody does these like things that you're like,

18:07.700 --> 18:08.900
maybe they're not so good.

18:08.900 --> 18:10.340
Maybe all the good people aren't so good.

18:10.900 --> 18:15.180
And he's got this like shadow side that he taps into and whenever he does that,

18:15.180 --> 18:16.500
you're like, yes, come on, Walter.

18:18.420 --> 18:20.460
Well, I, I didn't, I never looked at that.

18:20.460 --> 18:24.060
So that's, that's the thing I, you know, I, that's, that's amazing.

18:24.060 --> 18:24.540
I love that.

18:24.540 --> 18:28.460
I can see why then you appreciate these things even more, you know,

18:28.460 --> 18:30.100
seeing the deep layers of everything.

18:31.100 --> 18:31.500
Yes.

18:31.500 --> 18:34.620
And, and like you were saying with, with modern movies, there, there

18:34.620 --> 18:36.820
isn't really much thought to like the symmetry.

18:36.820 --> 18:38.140
It's very one dimensional.

18:38.140 --> 18:42.140
Like you see a white guy on the screen and you're like, okay, he's the bad guy.

18:43.140 --> 18:43.500
All right.

18:43.740 --> 18:46.300
And you don't get much more depth to that.

18:47.060 --> 18:48.740
No, no, you don't.

18:49.140 --> 18:53.460
And the, what you were saying, you know, you can see with the writing around the

18:53.460 --> 18:56.620
laziness of everything, you know, taking the easy route for everything.

18:57.260 --> 19:02.380
And, um, one of the things that I hate that, that's kind of come along

19:02.380 --> 19:08.140
with is the amount of cursing in, in every, every single, um, script.

19:08.620 --> 19:12.220
Because so, you know, there's some comedians that'll say, you know, I'm

19:12.220 --> 19:14.180
going to work clean, like Will Smith is one of them.

19:14.180 --> 19:16.140
He, he always said that he was going to work clean.

19:16.180 --> 19:20.700
I obviously broke that cursing, like crazy during the Oscar night.

19:20.740 --> 19:24.420
Um, but he's, he's always been one of those people who says like, I'm not

19:24.460 --> 19:25.060
going to curse.

19:25.060 --> 19:32.180
And, and I think with cursing, it's very easy to convey anger by just

19:32.180 --> 19:34.180
using certain four letter words.

19:34.740 --> 19:38.340
Um, it takes a lot of effort to convey it otherwise.

19:38.340 --> 19:40.980
And I think that's again, one of those things that really bothers me about

19:40.980 --> 19:46.420
like every now, you know, new TV show has cursing in it rather than actually

19:46.620 --> 19:52.420
working with the language, the English language to create, create dialogue

19:52.420 --> 19:56.100
that's engaging and interesting and like gives you full nuance of someone's

19:56.100 --> 19:59.980
character and feelings without having to rely on something like that.

20:00.060 --> 20:02.820
Which is what was nice about network TV in the past is that that's

20:02.820 --> 20:04.980
what it kind of demanded.

20:04.980 --> 20:05.900
It said, you can't curse.

20:05.900 --> 20:09.900
So a lot of people, but that limitation had to make sure that they

20:09.900 --> 20:13.100
were going to be really good at, at their mastery of the English language.

20:13.420 --> 20:16.540
And that's now without that limitation, people just kind of go with them,

20:16.660 --> 20:17.940
you know, lowest denominator.

20:18.260 --> 20:21.900
Again, I know that I sound like such a, such a, you know, buddy,

20:21.900 --> 20:26.420
daddy saying stuff like that, but I just really want to defend the English language.

20:28.060 --> 20:32.500
Well, I, I completely agree with you because if you don't have a lot of

20:32.500 --> 20:35.700
cursing, when, and you do have cursing, it, it really has weight to it.

20:36.700 --> 20:40.180
I have seen that where there's certain shows where they're saying the F

20:40.180 --> 20:43.660
word in every other sentence and it's kind of like, it just becomes a filler word.

20:44.380 --> 20:44.820
Yes.

20:44.820 --> 20:46.660
Kind of like the word like, you know.

20:47.140 --> 20:47.500
Yeah.

20:47.500 --> 20:48.780
It's in succession.

20:48.780 --> 20:51.740
That's one of the reasons I couldn't get into succession is that every

20:51.740 --> 20:53.140
other word was the F word.

20:53.820 --> 21:00.420
And what I liked about, um, what was interesting about Sex and the City was

21:00.420 --> 21:05.620
that there's a, I mean gratuitous amount of, uh, you know, sex scenes and nudity

21:05.620 --> 21:06.500
and all this stuff.

21:06.860 --> 21:09.780
But when it came to Sarah Jessica Parker's character, one of the things

21:09.780 --> 21:14.740
she said when they started working on that, she said, I know it's HBO and

21:14.740 --> 21:19.740
we can do anything, but I feel like my character being a writer should not be

21:19.740 --> 21:24.020
cursing all the time, that when she does curse, like you're saying, it adds that

21:24.020 --> 21:26.980
weight to it because that's the point is that she's a writer.

21:26.980 --> 21:30.460
She's, she should be good at communicating her emotions without having to

21:31.340 --> 21:35.900
devolve to that or resolve to that resort.

21:35.900 --> 21:36.140
Sorry.

21:36.140 --> 21:37.260
That's the word I was trying to think of.

21:37.620 --> 21:43.260
And so what those times that she would say, you know what F him that like hit

21:43.260 --> 21:47.380
really hard because that's, that was atypical for her to say something like

21:47.380 --> 21:50.740
that, you know, I, I am a big fan of that show.

21:51.020 --> 21:56.980
You are has, and like you were saying before, um, it has universal truths.

21:57.460 --> 22:01.500
So you don't have to look exactly like the people in the show to get it.

22:02.220 --> 22:06.820
And the swearing aspect, I remember the first episode of that show had the best

22:06.820 --> 22:10.260
writing of any show I've ever seen because she asked Mr.

22:10.260 --> 22:12.540
Big, have you ever been in love?

22:13.420 --> 22:15.460
And he says abs a fucking Lutley.

22:15.820 --> 22:16.140
Yeah.

22:16.340 --> 22:20.740
And you, you're like, okay, this is not going to be a traditional romance show

22:20.780 --> 22:26.180
because he just swore while talking about something that's very traditionally

22:26.180 --> 22:27.460
romantic, but he just swore.

22:27.460 --> 22:29.420
So this is not going to be that type of story.

22:29.980 --> 22:30.380
Right.

22:31.020 --> 22:32.820
I could go on on that show as well.

22:33.260 --> 22:33.500
Yeah.

22:33.500 --> 22:35.620
The writing for that show is really good.

22:35.940 --> 22:37.900
It is incredibly good.

22:38.340 --> 22:43.100
As good as that writing is, it's exactly the opposite when it comes to the reboot.

22:43.420 --> 22:49.420
And just like that is so poorly written, you can just see, yeah, you can just

22:49.420 --> 22:53.660
see sort of the evolution of, of writer rooms just from that.

22:53.660 --> 22:57.500
Because I think it's a lot of the same people still involved, but you can just

22:57.500 --> 23:01.740
see how the situation has really changed and, and talent has sort of devolved.

23:02.780 --> 23:03.100
Yeah.

23:03.380 --> 23:03.620
Yeah.

23:03.620 --> 23:07.140
Well, I think that show got consumed by identity politics as well.

23:07.700 --> 23:08.100
Yes.

23:08.700 --> 23:09.180
Yes.

23:09.460 --> 23:10.100
I mean, Mr.

23:10.100 --> 23:12.380
Big technically is canceled.

23:12.420 --> 23:15.100
Forget Chris Knoth, the actor who plays Mr.

23:15.100 --> 23:16.980
Big, but Mr.

23:16.980 --> 23:18.460
Big, the idea of Mr.

23:18.460 --> 23:24.420
Big is unacceptable in, in today's world because, you know, he's, he, he is what

23:25.660 --> 23:29.700
he represented everything that was emblematic of New York in the 90s, right?

23:29.700 --> 23:35.900
Extremely kind of bigger, larger than life, uh, you know, uh, very masculine,

23:35.940 --> 23:41.860
very sort of has his own way to everything very intrans, intransigent, uh,

23:41.860 --> 23:47.780
and extremely, uh, rich, which is like what the whole show is about.

23:47.780 --> 23:52.500
The whole show is about consumerism, you know, essentially it's about shoes.

23:52.500 --> 23:54.780
It's about all the best clothing.

23:54.780 --> 23:59.700
I mean, that was so much about it, but also about trying to find love at a time

24:00.060 --> 24:03.420
where New York was kind of past love, right?

24:03.420 --> 24:04.460
Past romance.

24:05.020 --> 24:09.740
And so it's, it's interesting because now they're trying to kind of, you know,

24:09.740 --> 24:11.380
they, they participate in all that.

24:11.540 --> 24:15.300
And now they're trying to prove that they've evolved beyond all of it.

24:15.540 --> 24:20.500
And, uh, you know, think that by killing off of a character, an iconic character,

24:20.500 --> 24:23.700
they can kind of claim moral high ground.

24:26.100 --> 24:26.460
Yeah.

24:26.460 --> 24:32.460
I've noticed that there's been a decline of, of romance in media and just in

24:32.460 --> 24:36.820
general, um, you can even look at like statistics with Gen Z.

24:37.260 --> 24:37.620
Yes.

24:37.620 --> 24:39.620
There's less romance, less children.

24:40.060 --> 24:44.300
Um, yeah, what, what do you think that's about less romance?

24:46.460 --> 24:50.620
I think so this is, this is actually kind of perfect to talk about because I've

24:50.620 --> 24:56.460
been, uh, neck deep in this feminist video that I seem to be working on forever.

24:56.460 --> 25:00.940
I started writing it in December and I'm finally, I think almost done with the

25:00.940 --> 25:05.420
editing and, uh, what, as part of that, so the question I've been trying to

25:05.420 --> 25:10.900
answer is like, how has feminism helped our society and how has it hurt it?

25:11.060 --> 25:16.220
Because I think we tend to take, at least out in the open, people tend to take a

25:16.220 --> 25:18.260
very sort of polarized view on everything.

25:18.260 --> 25:20.420
Oh, feminism sucks or feminism is great.

25:20.700 --> 25:23.780
What about the middle ground is kind of what I wanted to dive into.

25:24.460 --> 25:29.420
And so as part of that, I've read a lot of the writings of, of feminist thinkers,

25:29.860 --> 25:31.580
you know, across the 20th century.

25:31.580 --> 25:38.660
And the one that I found that I found to be the strangest was this woman called,

25:38.700 --> 25:41.460
uh, fire, uh, Shula myth firestone.

25:41.860 --> 25:47.460
And she, uh, you know, passed away recently in 2012, she, but in, in the 1970s,

25:47.460 --> 25:50.820
she was quite active and she wrote this book called the dialectic of sex.

25:51.420 --> 25:58.340
And in that she laid out what the future needed to look like, excuse me.

26:00.020 --> 26:05.260
Needed to look like in order for it to actually be fair for men and women.

26:05.980 --> 26:10.340
And she was building on a lot of the ideas that previous, um, previous feminists

26:10.340 --> 26:14.540
had had come out with, but there were a couple of points that she made.

26:15.060 --> 26:20.740
And one of them was around, um, around men and women just being indistinguishable,

26:21.420 --> 26:24.740
uh, physically, that they should be indistinguishable, that you should not be

26:24.740 --> 26:29.780
able to tell, um, the difference, and that women should not be responsible

26:29.780 --> 26:34.620
for bearing children, uh, because of the pain and anguish attached to that.

26:35.180 --> 26:40.260
And that, um, children should be bought, born in pods, little, little, you know,

26:40.460 --> 26:45.420
pods outside of women's bodies and that children should not even be raised

26:45.420 --> 26:47.380
by their genetic parents.

26:48.100 --> 26:53.300
Um, so, and that, and that the nuclear family should be eradicated.

26:54.140 --> 26:59.140
So there, all these ideas, and this was pretty consistent with sort of other

26:59.140 --> 27:03.100
thinkers, yes, she pushed it even further, uh, by saying that women should, you

27:03.100 --> 27:06.820
know, should not bear children period, but there were a lot of feminist thinkers

27:06.820 --> 27:11.300
before her, uh, starting from the sixties that were suggesting that women should

27:11.300 --> 27:17.620
not engage in, in sort of motherhood and family and in relationships with men,

27:17.620 --> 27:25.020
that that was the ultimate, um, feminist move was to just reject any sort of

27:25.020 --> 27:26.220
relationship with men.

27:26.540 --> 27:29.580
And many of them suggested then, okay, well, how do you fix loneliness?

27:29.580 --> 27:32.740
Oh, it's like, oh, engage in lesbianism is, was sort of the answer.

27:33.300 --> 27:38.020
Um, so it's that whole idea that women are so much happier without men and men

27:38.020 --> 27:39.740
are just useless and get rid of them.

27:39.740 --> 27:43.620
And, you know, they're just responsible for the patriarchy and, and, uh, up,

27:43.660 --> 27:47.540
up, and the whole, whole, whole board by not even engaging with them.

27:47.940 --> 27:53.140
So I think that sort of thinking has been making its way and trickling into

27:53.140 --> 27:58.900
various parts of, of sort of the teachings that, that, you know, children go

27:58.900 --> 28:02.780
through when they go, go through college, that they, they get indoctrinated with

28:02.780 --> 28:07.700
this idea that it's men and it's women and we're against each other.

28:07.700 --> 28:10.340
And, you know, there can be only one winner.

28:10.820 --> 28:13.980
You know, you don't need to engage with the other side.

28:13.980 --> 28:15.260
You don't need to compromise.

28:15.260 --> 28:17.180
You don't need to find a way to work together.

28:17.180 --> 28:19.860
You don't need to build partnerships with the other, other sex.

28:20.180 --> 28:25.180
It's just, you know, it's going to be one winner and it's going to be women.

28:25.660 --> 28:30.940
And I think as part of that, then you're seeing those types of thinkers, you know,

28:30.940 --> 28:36.060
the, the, the sort of disciples of those, that sort of thinking, then entering

28:36.140 --> 28:36.940
writer's room.

28:36.940 --> 28:41.380
So any sort of modern writing is not about romance at all.

28:41.420 --> 28:42.980
It's actually about domination.

28:43.340 --> 28:46.780
So Captain Marvel has no love interest.

28:46.860 --> 28:52.980
Her only marriage is because, you know, she's, um, she's, I think, made a political

28:52.980 --> 28:55.860
alliance or something in the, in the new Marvel movie.

28:55.860 --> 28:57.660
I don't know if you saw that, the Marvels.

28:58.220 --> 29:02.700
And yeah, oh, you probably saved yourself some time and time and money.

29:02.740 --> 29:03.460
I couldn't do it.

29:04.380 --> 29:09.700
There was, uh, uh, uh, an extra scene.

29:09.740 --> 29:11.860
I don't know why I'm forgetting the word that deleted scene.

29:11.860 --> 29:12.260
There you go.

29:12.740 --> 29:19.300
That, uh, nerd Roddick showed on his channel and, uh, in the deleted scene,

29:19.860 --> 29:25.580
there was this like very inappropriate lesbian joke made by one character to

29:25.580 --> 29:26.780
another, who's underage.

29:27.460 --> 29:33.340
So it's very obvious that that, all of that sort of perspective on just cut men

29:33.340 --> 29:37.980
out is very strong within the writers and they're just trying to insert it

29:38.020 --> 29:39.060
anywhere possible.

29:39.420 --> 29:45.460
And so it's old fashioned to be in love with a man and want to form a good

29:45.460 --> 29:46.460
partnership with him.

29:46.460 --> 29:47.140
It's old fashioned.

29:47.140 --> 29:49.100
It's anti feminist to do that.

29:49.420 --> 29:51.260
It's anti woman to do that.

29:51.620 --> 29:57.580
And you see that even, uh, surface up with that, uh, Rachel Zegler interview

29:57.820 --> 30:02.780
where she says, um, you know, there's a big focus on her love story.

30:03.260 --> 30:05.180
And she's so sarcastic about it.

30:05.180 --> 30:11.140
She's so irritated about it, despite she herself having a boyfriend that she

30:11.140 --> 30:12.940
often talks about in references.

30:13.380 --> 30:17.140
Uh, and she talks about how the prince could be completely cut from the story.

30:17.140 --> 30:17.460
Right.

30:17.460 --> 30:22.780
It's, it's who cares about love when there's power to be had, right?

30:23.180 --> 30:26.020
And that's one of those things that's very interesting is that that's what.

30:26.540 --> 30:31.220
Feminists think of the patriarchy, that the patriarchy only cares about power

30:31.260 --> 30:32.460
and they don't care about love.

30:33.020 --> 30:36.780
Um, and that's their, that's the very, I think very, you know, we can dive

30:36.780 --> 30:42.260
into the patriarchy whenever, but that's a very simple, overly simplistic, uh,

30:42.740 --> 30:44.740
understanding of how men think.

30:45.260 --> 30:50.140
And so that's, this is their counteraction to that and saying love is a distraction.

30:50.340 --> 30:53.340
Love requires compromise.

30:53.580 --> 30:56.300
It requires, uh, sacrifice.

30:56.660 --> 31:00.420
Um, so why would an individual do that, especially if we're pushing for a

31:00.420 --> 31:04.380
very self-first perspective and philosophy in life?

31:04.820 --> 31:11.420
So instead we should say, F love, we should go and seek power and leadership.

31:12.380 --> 31:12.980
Yikes.

31:13.220 --> 31:18.060
Well, it seems like the actions are driven entirely by resentment.

31:19.020 --> 31:23.740
You know, there's no, I've heard that you're either driven by gratitude or by resentment.

31:24.420 --> 31:27.540
And I think it's very clear that the people creating these movies are

31:27.540 --> 31:28.900
driven by resentment now.

31:29.460 --> 31:33.980
It's like all about what power do they lack or, you know, how they've been

31:33.980 --> 31:37.460
wronged and it all stems from, to me, it all stems from narcissism.

31:38.140 --> 31:40.220
Cause there's two types of narcissism.

31:40.980 --> 31:45.060
There's the, the form where you think everybody's better than you.

31:45.500 --> 31:47.180
So you were entitled to what they have.

31:48.060 --> 31:53.100
You, you need to be leveled out or you believe that you are better than everybody

31:53.100 --> 31:54.700
else and you're entitled as well.

31:54.700 --> 31:59.860
Like both, both views lead to entitlement and that you're better than

31:59.860 --> 32:01.940
it, you know, that you come first.

32:02.340 --> 32:02.620
Yeah.

32:02.820 --> 32:06.140
And so you see that in, in the way that the characters in these movies behave.

32:06.740 --> 32:09.420
It's this resentful narcissism.

32:10.540 --> 32:14.740
And I don't think it's really connecting with audiences anymore, because if

32:14.740 --> 32:19.380
you're looking at the numbers, it's been like flop after flop after flop with

32:19.380 --> 32:21.460
these huge budget films.

32:21.460 --> 32:24.940
So they're going to either have to correct their mistakes.

32:24.940 --> 32:28.460
So they're just going to, they're going to not be able to sustain this, right?

32:28.980 --> 32:30.260
Yeah, absolutely.

32:30.260 --> 32:35.700
And, um, I think they're going to keep going for some time because the thing

32:35.700 --> 32:40.460
is wokeness and I know we'll, we'll, we'll touch on some of this stuff of how

32:40.460 --> 32:47.740
it's going to sort of infected companies and cities later, but wokeness is, is

32:47.740 --> 32:54.220
such, um, such an infection in that once it enters certain environments, it's

32:54.220 --> 32:56.500
very hard to argue against.

32:57.060 --> 33:01.940
It's very hard to overthrow and because it's very easy for people who are

33:01.940 --> 33:07.580
willing to play that woke game, it's very easy for them to destroy other

33:07.580 --> 33:11.180
people's reputations by casting aspersions on their character and calling

33:11.180 --> 33:16.500
them racist and bigoted and, and those sorts of, those sorts of terms really

33:16.500 --> 33:21.540
stick, you know, you, you say that enough, enough people say it, um, you know, it's

33:21.540 --> 33:23.940
very destructive on an individual level.

33:23.940 --> 33:27.020
So why would someone sort of stand up to that?

33:27.260 --> 33:31.900
And so you just need one or two bad actors from, from a wokeness side to

33:31.900 --> 33:33.900
kind of overthrow an entire organization.

33:34.140 --> 33:38.060
It's really not that, not that hard because we live in a polite society.

33:38.060 --> 33:39.140
We don't want to offend.

33:39.580 --> 33:40.900
Uh, we're not brutes.

33:41.100 --> 33:45.420
So it's almost like the strengths, the greatest strengths of Western society

33:45.460 --> 33:48.620
are getting turned on itself, so to speak.

33:49.380 --> 33:54.540
And everything you're saying about the resentment aspect of it, you know, I

33:54.540 --> 33:58.500
think one of the best stories ever written is Groundhog Day.

33:58.820 --> 34:00.340
And I don't know if you've watched that movie.

34:00.500 --> 34:00.980
Have you?

34:01.420 --> 34:02.380
I have to now.

34:02.940 --> 34:06.860
You, and I think you'll really, I think you'll really enjoy it.

34:07.420 --> 34:11.820
And I, you know, without giving, well, you can give it away.

34:11.820 --> 34:12.500
I'll still watch it.

34:12.500 --> 34:18.380
Um, yeah, I don't want to get, I don't want to ruin the experience for you,

34:18.380 --> 34:23.100
but it's not, I mean, I think you can anticipate what the movie might be

34:23.100 --> 34:24.700
about the second you start watching it.

34:24.700 --> 34:29.380
But the, what's great about that movie is first of all, the premises

34:29.380 --> 34:33.820
that this man is waking up and reliving the same day over and over.

34:33.860 --> 34:36.980
So you must have heard that part, uh, because it's something, it's like

34:36.980 --> 34:41.900
a fun trope that he's literally replaying Groundhog Day every day.

34:41.900 --> 34:43.220
And he has no idea why.

34:44.020 --> 34:49.340
And when you meet the character, his name is Phil and, you know, played

34:49.340 --> 34:52.740
really well by, uh, Marie, right?

34:52.940 --> 34:53.420
Yes.

34:53.500 --> 34:53.780
Okay.

34:53.780 --> 34:55.060
I'm so glad you remembered his name.

34:55.420 --> 34:58.700
Uh, and he, you know, played so well by him.

34:59.060 --> 35:07.380
And when you meet him, he is this very resentful sort of narcissistic, um,

35:07.940 --> 35:12.180
self-aggrandizing type character and he's full of loathing.

35:12.180 --> 35:15.940
He, I mean, for everything, for life, for the world, people around him,

35:15.940 --> 35:19.460
his colleagues, uh, his job, everything.

35:19.940 --> 35:25.500
And so you see him live two particular days before the repeating starts.

35:25.820 --> 35:28.700
And when you see the second day that he lives, the one day that he

35:28.700 --> 35:31.980
keeps repeating over and over, you realize it's actually a really

35:31.980 --> 35:35.180
shitty day that he ends up living where he wakes up.

35:35.180 --> 35:37.500
He's, you know, he's here in this town.

35:37.500 --> 35:40.940
He's reporting on Groundhog Day and he wakes up.

35:40.940 --> 35:43.100
He's at an, at a BNB.

35:43.220 --> 35:44.580
It's a cold day.

35:44.580 --> 35:47.180
He's rude to the person he meets outside of his room.

35:47.180 --> 35:48.100
He mocks him.

35:48.380 --> 35:49.340
He goes downstairs.

35:49.340 --> 35:51.740
He's rude to the BNB owner.

35:51.780 --> 35:54.460
You know, she doesn't know what espresso is and he mocks her for that.

35:54.740 --> 35:59.460
He, he walks out, he sees some old man and he's who's asking for money.

35:59.460 --> 36:01.220
And he kind of mocks him as well.

36:01.460 --> 36:05.340
He tries to avoid this insurance salesman that he runs into who's

36:05.340 --> 36:08.260
an old, old student from his own, own school.

36:08.620 --> 36:13.460
He ends up getting, walking into a puddle, like a really cold, wet puddle.

36:13.460 --> 36:18.980
And like he's just having this terrible day and he comes, he gets to his job,

36:18.980 --> 36:20.260
he reports on it again.

36:20.260 --> 36:25.100
He's like sarcastically reporting on this job and, and you see him play

36:25.100 --> 36:31.540
out this whole day and it's like, what, what entity forced him to relive

36:31.540 --> 36:38.100
this day every, like for possibly years, like people estimate that that day he

36:38.100 --> 36:42.340
lived for maybe 10 years over and over is what people think.

36:42.340 --> 36:46.660
Like it's like thousands and thousands of times he's waking up, but it's,

36:46.740 --> 36:51.860
it's that we experience his experience, we experience his life for that one

36:51.860 --> 36:55.780
sliver of a day, but you can make that assumption that that's how he was living

36:55.780 --> 36:57.940
every single day of his life leading up to that.

36:58.460 --> 37:05.740
And the movie, as it evolves, forces him to rethink some things because

37:05.780 --> 37:09.860
there's just no out of sheer, you know, lack of choice.

37:10.340 --> 37:14.140
And suddenly he switches his perspective from being sort of the super

37:14.140 --> 37:19.940
silliest person or even hedonistic person to suddenly he's like, let me

37:19.940 --> 37:24.180
see if I can help people because I'm here and I see what they're up to.

37:24.660 --> 37:26.540
And suddenly he just starts helping people.

37:26.900 --> 37:28.860
He helps the old man that he comes across.

37:28.860 --> 37:34.060
He makes sure that he's warm and fed and he goes to, uh, he realizes that one

37:34.060 --> 37:36.580
kid across the block like broke his leg.

37:36.580 --> 37:40.100
So he, every time, you know, he's about to break his leg every day.

37:40.100 --> 37:42.940
He's, he saves him and prevents him from breaking his leg.

37:43.260 --> 37:46.780
Unlike some old women get a flat tire and he goes and spends time on that.

37:46.780 --> 37:50.380
And that's just him helping people around the town, but he starts

37:50.380 --> 37:54.940
learning how to play the piano and he starts learning how to ice sculpt.

37:54.940 --> 37:58.300
And like, he starts reading French poetry and there are all these

37:58.300 --> 38:00.060
little things he starts engaging in.

38:00.580 --> 38:06.580
And then as a, as a result, it actually completely changes his perspective on life.

38:06.820 --> 38:12.020
And you, so you see from in the beginning, he lives this terrible, terrible day to

38:12.020 --> 38:16.740
suddenly the last day you see, he lives this wondrous day where he goes

38:16.740 --> 38:19.660
around reading everybody of their misery.

38:20.340 --> 38:26.140
And you realize that nothing has changed.

38:26.340 --> 38:28.660
It's not, it's like the day is exactly the same.

38:28.660 --> 38:29.940
Life is exactly the same.

38:30.140 --> 38:31.820
It's his perspective has changed.

38:31.820 --> 38:33.860
His effort into his life has changed.

38:34.180 --> 38:37.140
His, how he thinks about other people has changed.

38:37.140 --> 38:41.820
And he went from living this resentful, terrible life to actually a

38:41.820 --> 38:47.500
very fulfilling, thoughtful life where he's looked at by other people and

38:47.500 --> 38:48.740
respected by other people.

38:48.740 --> 38:51.660
But whereas before people couldn't give a damn about him.

38:52.220 --> 38:58.260
And the, the person who wrote this and the directors, they both said that they

38:58.260 --> 39:03.940
receive so many letters from across the globe saying, this is the perfect

39:04.820 --> 39:05.820
Buddhist movie.

39:05.820 --> 39:07.580
This is the perfect Hindu movie.

39:07.580 --> 39:09.620
This is the perfect Jewish movie.

39:09.620 --> 39:13.620
This is the perfect, you know, Christian movie, because they were talking about

39:13.620 --> 39:16.780
like what lessons that this, this movie was espousing.

39:17.180 --> 39:22.420
And the reality is it's actually the perfect, it's perfect universally because

39:22.420 --> 39:29.500
it could evade that basic idea that nothing you do in life is under your,

39:29.860 --> 39:34.460
sorry, life in general, what happens to you is mostly not under your control.

39:35.020 --> 39:37.660
It's what you, how you choose to engage with life.

39:37.660 --> 39:39.300
That's really important.

39:39.540 --> 39:43.900
And that idea is so universal that people across the globe are writing to him and

39:43.900 --> 39:47.860
saying, this really spoke to me, you know, this completely connected with me.

39:48.100 --> 39:48.700
And thank you.

39:48.700 --> 39:50.580
And, and, and that's the point.

39:50.620 --> 39:52.860
That's what makes a good story.

39:53.340 --> 39:55.620
And that's what makes a story transcend time.

39:56.180 --> 40:01.180
Is if it, if it gets to the core of like actually solving a very important question,

40:01.180 --> 40:06.100
which is how do you find a way to live a really good life despite the endless

40:06.100 --> 40:12.180
miseries of life, but also why then exploring why resentment is so attractive

40:12.180 --> 40:15.940
to it, to a lot of people and everybody goes through that, right?

40:16.060 --> 40:18.660
You could be the most optimistic person possible.

40:19.140 --> 40:21.860
And I'm, I'm a very optimistic person.

40:22.260 --> 40:25.740
But for the last four years, I had a very trying time.

40:25.740 --> 40:28.260
There were a lot of things that were happening in my life personally,

40:28.540 --> 40:32.580
including health issues and like family issues and all the stuff that it, I

40:32.580 --> 40:37.500
could see the door, I could see the door open for me to walk through and become

40:37.500 --> 40:39.060
this very resentful person.

40:39.500 --> 40:43.180
It's like that, there's always that attraction, but it takes that, it takes

40:43.180 --> 40:47.260
work to stay on the optimistic side and that at the end of the day, it just

40:47.300 --> 40:49.220
benefits you, you live a better life.

40:49.580 --> 40:52.740
If you engage with an optimistic perspective versus a, you know, a

40:52.740 --> 40:55.620
resentful, sort of angry one.

40:58.460 --> 41:03.020
Well, that's a beautiful analogy and I have so many thoughts.

41:04.100 --> 41:09.660
And the saying I say all the time is fate is what you are given.

41:10.180 --> 41:11.620
Destiny is what you make of it.

41:12.700 --> 41:13.820
And I like that.

41:14.300 --> 41:16.860
I think that speaks to two things are true at the same time.

41:17.740 --> 41:22.220
You are a product of your environment, but your environment is also a product of you.

41:23.180 --> 41:27.740
So when people get drawn towards that victim mindset, it's so attractive

41:27.740 --> 41:30.260
because it says, Hey, nothing's your fault.

41:30.780 --> 41:32.340
You're just a product of your environment.

41:33.060 --> 41:35.540
You didn't pick your genes or your parents or where you're born.

41:35.940 --> 41:37.380
So none of this is your fault.

41:38.220 --> 41:40.900
And you're like, yes, thank you.

41:40.900 --> 41:42.020
That, that is true.

41:42.140 --> 41:43.140
And it is true.

41:44.140 --> 41:48.540
But what is also true at the same time is your environment is a product of you.

41:49.420 --> 41:55.940
So you can enact free will and create the situation that you want to make it.

41:55.940 --> 41:57.500
And it all starts within your own mind.

41:58.260 --> 42:02.460
And that's kind of why we watch that movie, Groundhog Day in the first place.

42:02.900 --> 42:08.180
Cause if it was just him reliving the same day every day and there was no evolution

42:08.180 --> 42:10.140
of his mindset, why would we even watch it?

42:10.980 --> 42:14.660
That's kind of why we watch movies is to see this hero's journey play out.

42:15.220 --> 42:19.500
You know, they start in this resentful, bitter place like Thor or something.

42:20.340 --> 42:21.820
And then they have to learn this important lesson.

42:21.820 --> 42:25.660
And they come out on the other side, this evolved enlightened being.

42:26.500 --> 42:31.660
And I think that's what modern movies are missing so much is the characters don't develop.

42:32.300 --> 42:36.780
And in so many of the scenes, nothing is lost and nothing is gained.

42:37.300 --> 42:38.620
And you're kind of like sitting there.

42:38.620 --> 42:39.900
Why did I even watch this?

42:40.380 --> 42:44.420
Cause it's almost like the producer said, we need one more battle scene here.

42:44.940 --> 42:47.300
And they just inserted it after the movie was already made.

42:48.260 --> 42:50.620
And but, you know, nobody can die and nobody can get hurt.

42:50.620 --> 42:52.740
So because it can't impact the later scene.

42:53.540 --> 42:58.060
Whereas you think of a good movie, Lord of the Rings, every single battle,

42:58.060 --> 43:02.220
every line, every interaction, something is lost and something is gained.

43:02.740 --> 43:05.020
So you, you know, everything has weight to it.

43:05.220 --> 43:06.780
Everything becomes important.

43:07.700 --> 43:11.900
So yeah, that's, that's why we tune into these things to see that evolution.

43:12.460 --> 43:15.260
Yeah, yeah, I don't know what you said.

43:16.140 --> 43:18.180
Absolutely, absolutely agree with you.

43:18.180 --> 43:20.780
There's no, there's, yeah, there's, there are no stakes.

43:21.140 --> 43:26.020
And that's what's interesting about Echo is that not only are there no stakes,

43:26.580 --> 43:28.620
there are also no morals.

43:28.700 --> 43:33.580
You know, she wants, she wants to replace the crime boss that she used to work for.

43:33.580 --> 43:34.980
She's this assassin.

43:35.740 --> 43:40.940
And she, you know, she realizes that this man kind of betrayed her.

43:41.180 --> 43:44.420
So she goes and, you know, shoot some in the face.

43:44.980 --> 43:48.980
And now she wants to be, you know, run the ring herself.

43:49.220 --> 43:53.420
And there's no recognition that she's gone around killing people.

43:53.420 --> 43:57.500
There are no consequences for that, you know, there is no atonement for that.

43:57.820 --> 43:59.460
She's not really a hero.

44:00.380 --> 44:05.460
Um, she's only so because you're being told that she is so there's no actual

44:05.460 --> 44:07.140
morality attached to it.

44:07.380 --> 44:10.540
So that, and that's the other thing is that there's no sort of everything sort

44:10.540 --> 44:13.860
of murky on that side as well.

44:15.260 --> 44:21.100
Well, yeah, that's, that's also a sign of good story writing because the line

44:21.100 --> 44:23.020
between good and evil is not very simple.

44:23.580 --> 44:26.300
You know, you can't just put all the oppressors on one side and all the

44:26.300 --> 44:27.220
oppressed on the other.

44:28.060 --> 44:34.140
Um, the famous writer, Alexander Sultan, it's saying his name wrong, but he was

44:34.140 --> 44:36.260
the Russian writer that was in a gulag.

44:36.900 --> 44:42.100
He famously said that the line between good and evil runs between every human heart.

44:43.260 --> 44:47.900
And this was very profound for him to say, because he was at the mercy of these

44:47.900 --> 44:54.620
communist soldiers in a gulag and he was able to even see the humanity in them.

44:55.020 --> 44:58.660
And he was able to see that people that were right next to him in the camps

44:58.660 --> 45:00.500
were also had evil qualities.

45:00.500 --> 45:05.020
So it's like everybody, with just a few different tweaks of your

45:05.020 --> 45:09.220
circumstances, you could end up being that soldier at the gulag, or you could

45:09.220 --> 45:14.020
be a prisoner, you know, it's not clear who's good and who's bad.

45:14.540 --> 45:14.980
Right.

45:15.460 --> 45:22.500
And I think, um, I think there was a lot of black and white perspective on, on,

45:22.660 --> 45:26.700
you know, that could be achieved on, on the war when it came to World War II,

45:27.220 --> 45:30.620
because of this like mass imprisonment that happened of people.

45:31.060 --> 45:37.100
But everything that's happened geopolitically since is so nuanced that people crave,

45:37.140 --> 45:40.700
but people crave that black and white perspective is that they, they don't want

45:40.700 --> 45:42.460
it, you know, and I, I do too.

45:42.460 --> 45:44.580
I'm not, I'm not pinning it just on other people.

45:44.580 --> 45:48.700
I too wish that I could just say that person's evil and, you know, our country

45:48.700 --> 45:49.180
is great.

45:49.180 --> 45:54.380
And then that way I can just connect with our country's, um, national identity

45:54.380 --> 45:57.580
and never have to question it, you know, and I can just feel safe in the

45:57.580 --> 46:01.620
national identity, but everything is so murky, but people are often looking for

46:01.620 --> 46:05.500
that is that who's the bad guy and I want to be part of the good guys and, and

46:05.500 --> 46:06.620
just leave it at that.

46:08.420 --> 46:09.100
Very true.

46:09.100 --> 46:12.740
I think there was a point in American history where we did think that we were

46:12.740 --> 46:17.140
the good guys and we were absolutely sure that probably after World War II, we

46:17.180 --> 46:21.340
were patting ourselves on the back, but I think around Vietnam is when we

46:21.340 --> 46:24.020
realized actually we might be the bad guys.

46:24.580 --> 46:29.500
And I think a lot of that American innocence was ripped away in the 60s.

46:30.140 --> 46:30.500
Yes.

46:30.500 --> 46:35.220
And I think one of the things that makes me really sad is it was really

46:35.220 --> 46:40.460
interesting to watch, uh, Robert, uh, F Kennedy juniors, uh, podcasts.

46:40.460 --> 46:45.820
If you haven't watched, um, his talk, by the way, on Joe Rogan and Lex Freedman,

46:46.060 --> 46:47.340
just incredible.

46:47.860 --> 46:53.540
And he talks a lot about his father and his uncle and their assassinations and,

46:54.300 --> 47:00.780
but also how his father and his uncle really helped prevent the war escalation,

47:00.780 --> 47:07.180
the Cold War escalation with, uh, with Russia and the whole sort of machine kind

47:07.180 --> 47:13.260
of what Eisenhower warned us about the, the complex industry, uh, the military

47:13.260 --> 47:14.180
industrial complex.

47:14.220 --> 47:14.460
Yes.

47:14.460 --> 47:14.820
There you go.

47:15.540 --> 47:19.540
Uh, and the obsession with, with another, starting another war, that there was

47:19.540 --> 47:24.540
this whole machine trying to manipulate JFK into going to war.

47:25.180 --> 47:32.340
Um, and both RFK and JFK sort of coalesced and decided to try to deescalate

47:32.340 --> 47:35.020
it by just connecting with Gorbachev directly.

47:35.740 --> 47:41.020
And I think RFK ended up writing a letter to Gorbachev and talking about the

47:41.020 --> 47:42.860
importance of a future for their children.

47:42.860 --> 47:46.100
And Gorbachev being a father himself really connected with that.

47:46.460 --> 47:50.540
And RF, RFK Junior tells the story much better than I could do it justice.

47:50.540 --> 47:55.820
But what I found really sad about that is that here were two men that were

47:55.820 --> 48:00.140
thinking about rather than their legacy, cause they could have thought from the

48:00.140 --> 48:05.540
perspective of, you know, being those presidents that are waging into war and,

48:05.900 --> 48:10.820
and, you know, recognized as heroes and vanquishing the enemy, so to speak, and

48:10.820 --> 48:12.780
just cementing their legacy accordingly.

48:12.780 --> 48:16.660
And all they could think about instead was, you know, the people that, you

48:16.660 --> 48:20.100
know, millions of Russians will die, millions of Americans will die.

48:20.620 --> 48:24.540
And that that's more important than any individual's legacy.

48:25.340 --> 48:30.700
And knowing that these two men couldn't be sort of bamboozled into going into

48:30.700 --> 48:36.020
war, and there were many attempts made to convince our JFK to send troops to

48:36.020 --> 48:36.660
Vietnam.

48:36.660 --> 48:40.500
That was actually what RFK Junior talked about, that his, his uncle was

48:40.700 --> 48:44.100
really resisting starting a war with Vietnam.

48:44.780 --> 48:47.220
And that, that's when the assassination happened.

48:47.780 --> 48:53.620
You know, and after that, LBJ, the, the vice president got promoted.

48:54.140 --> 48:56.140
And very quickly we went into Vietnam.

48:56.500 --> 48:59.100
So you have to wonder sort of around that.

48:59.100 --> 49:03.220
I'm not making broad statements there, but you just have to kind of wonder what

49:03.220 --> 49:04.580
exactly was going on there.

49:04.900 --> 49:09.940
But that's so sad that, you know, these men looked at someone like

49:09.980 --> 49:15.540
JFK, who was essentially in that context, the best man among them, who was

49:15.540 --> 49:19.260
willing to think about greater good than, than their, than his own selfish

49:19.260 --> 49:19.900
desires.

49:20.660 --> 49:26.140
And they decided to get together and, and, you know, maybe get him out of the

49:26.140 --> 49:26.580
job.

49:27.260 --> 49:30.540
So that, and that's what happens, right?

49:30.540 --> 49:33.540
You, it takes one man to stand up to something like that, to prevent

49:33.540 --> 49:34.460
something bad like that.

49:34.460 --> 49:38.180
But that's, that's what moral degradation looks like, is that when good

49:38.180 --> 49:41.460
men are unable to, to do anything, to stop it, right?

49:41.460 --> 49:46.260
You don't, you have a room of, of like smokey cigars, just driving, you know,

49:46.260 --> 49:50.740
very sort of narcissistic, like selfish desires forward versus thinking about

49:50.740 --> 49:52.220
the bigger picture of things.

49:54.340 --> 49:54.660
Yeah.

49:54.660 --> 50:00.340
Well, it seems like we're at a point where the actions of our country,

50:00.940 --> 50:05.260
especially abroad globally, don't seem to be in the best interest of the

50:05.260 --> 50:11.420
vast majority of citizens in America, it seems to be serving this very small

50:11.460 --> 50:16.180
elite group who is like this puppeteer pulling the strings.

50:16.180 --> 50:19.660
And we're sitting here like, nobody really wants to go to war.

50:19.660 --> 50:24.660
I haven't really met a single person that was just like gung-ho about going to

50:24.660 --> 50:29.660
war and it doesn't seem like we're getting much out of it.

50:30.620 --> 50:34.940
And, but we're sending all these resources to other countries to keep this going.

50:35.820 --> 50:41.340
Yet, when a tragedy happens in America, like in Hawaii, the citizens in Hawaii

50:41.340 --> 50:46.060
are kind of left needing help and, you know, they're American citizens.

50:46.060 --> 50:46.740
Where's their help?

50:47.500 --> 50:50.620
Well, it's not really in the interest of these puppeteers.

50:51.180 --> 50:54.620
So, you know, they don't really get much from helping the Hawaiian citizen.

50:56.100 --> 50:56.700
Absolutely.

50:57.460 --> 51:01.180
And I think this is where the self-governance aspect has really fallen

51:01.180 --> 51:02.380
apart in society.

51:02.380 --> 51:06.820
Like, if we have to wonder, you know, what exactly is wrong with everything

51:06.820 --> 51:11.060
that's going on, it's the fall of self-governance.

51:11.060 --> 51:17.940
Because laws and even constitutions, they don't actually implement anything.

51:17.940 --> 51:22.620
You know, they set the tone, but it's an agreement that the individuals

51:22.620 --> 51:24.380
have to maintain it, right?

51:25.340 --> 51:30.540
So, what ends up maintaining a good society is culture.

51:31.180 --> 51:34.300
And what ends up maintaining a good culture is self-governance.

51:34.660 --> 51:37.460
And how much an individual is willing to do the right thing.

51:37.980 --> 51:40.100
And so the culture reinforces that.

51:40.100 --> 51:42.300
And then the individual reinforces the culture.

51:42.860 --> 51:49.660
And this is, you know, the common Nietzsche line is that we have killed God, right?

51:49.660 --> 51:54.540
And, and he predicted all the things that were to come that have happened

51:54.540 --> 51:55.740
in the 20th century.

51:56.460 --> 52:00.260
And I think that's where we're really languishing as a society is that we

52:00.260 --> 52:02.580
don't know what to do with ourselves post-God.

52:03.260 --> 52:09.500
And we're seeing, we're very, we're very quick to reject the idea of God.

52:10.340 --> 52:16.220
And, and say, oh, that's such an antiquated idea of some man in the sky,

52:16.260 --> 52:18.700
kind of like cartoonish perspective on God.

52:19.180 --> 52:23.380
But once we've destroyed him, we've actually replaced him with ourselves.

52:23.820 --> 52:27.740
And that's a terrible, on a, on a human level, that's actually terrible for us.

52:28.100 --> 52:32.980
We, we should not think of ourselves on an individual level as the most sort

52:32.980 --> 52:41.580
of the highest being to kind of abide by that what you do alone when no one is

52:41.580 --> 52:46.100
looking, your, your selfish mind will say, that's fine.

52:46.100 --> 52:47.220
You can do whatever you want.

52:47.580 --> 52:50.940
If you have a relationship with a higher power, you would say, no,

52:50.940 --> 52:52.420
what's the right thing to do?

52:52.900 --> 52:55.460
And that conversation is completely lost.

52:55.860 --> 53:01.900
And so people, people kind of, people have become more and more just out

53:01.900 --> 53:02.820
for themselves.

53:03.300 --> 53:07.540
It's like, I can do whatever I can, even if, you know, even if you look at a

53:07.540 --> 53:13.820
very un-successful CEO of a massive company, you know, who's getting fired for

53:13.820 --> 53:17.260
a job because his, his company is, you know, laying off people and doing

53:17.260 --> 53:23.260
really poorly and yet his, his, um, you know, exit package includes a 50

53:23.260 --> 53:25.660
million dollar bonus, right?

53:26.140 --> 53:31.940
There should not be a law that says, Hey, unsuccessful CEOs should not be paid.

53:32.700 --> 53:39.420
But on an individual level, if you're a moral person who says, what about, what

53:39.420 --> 53:44.220
about this is right for me to take money for a job poorly done?

53:44.940 --> 53:49.020
You know, and, and there's no, that sort of that cultural reinforcement nor

53:49.020 --> 53:54.540
individual reinforcement of doing right by society.

53:55.100 --> 53:56.540
And that's where we're at right now.

53:56.540 --> 53:59.820
So that's why, so, and then other people look at it and say, well, if other

53:59.820 --> 54:02.300
people are going to live for themselves, I'm going to live for myself.

54:02.780 --> 54:06.300
So everybody's just sort of bumping into each other, living for themselves,

54:06.500 --> 54:07.860
trying to screw each other over.

54:08.580 --> 54:13.940
So, so we don't really know what to sort of who to answer to what to do.

54:14.140 --> 54:16.100
And everybody's like, just get out of my way.

54:16.100 --> 54:17.540
It's like individual first.

54:18.780 --> 54:20.820
I don't know if I did the best job at explaining that, but.

54:20.900 --> 54:22.380
No, you did an amazing job there.

54:22.380 --> 54:26.260
You made me, I'm really glad you brought up that quote from Nietzsche because I've

54:26.260 --> 54:27.740
been looking into him a lot lately.

54:28.100 --> 54:31.700
And I think that's so relevant when you look at what's happening in, in these

54:31.700 --> 54:37.020
like big urban cities where there's a complete lack of common belief system.

54:37.420 --> 54:38.620
They've killed God.

54:39.540 --> 54:42.100
And so there's nothing holding the people together.

54:42.980 --> 54:47.580
And we like to think that we've got science now and we're really enlightened.

54:47.580 --> 54:52.140
And we, you know, science has given us all this convenience and comfort, but

54:52.140 --> 54:54.380
you can't get your morals from science.

54:54.620 --> 54:57.140
You cannot get your principles from just dry facts.

54:58.140 --> 55:01.060
And I think that's what religion does.

55:01.060 --> 55:02.900
You know, there's good and bad with everything.

55:02.900 --> 55:08.940
But one thing that religion does is it tells you a code of morals to live by.

55:10.180 --> 55:15.860
And so when somebody falls in front of you and gets hurt, uh, you know,

55:15.900 --> 55:19.340
a religious text would say you get down and you help that person.

55:20.180 --> 55:21.780
So you know when that happens to do that.

55:21.820 --> 55:25.700
But if you don't have that core belief system, somebody falls down in front of

55:25.700 --> 55:28.620
you, you can kind of just look at them and say, Oh, that's not my problem.

55:28.780 --> 55:31.420
You know, there, if I help them, what would happen to me?

55:32.380 --> 55:38.940
You know, like it reminds me of, uh, the good Samaritan idea and being a good neighbor.

55:40.460 --> 55:48.860
And, um, yeah, I look around cities now and I see a lot of godless behavior, a lot

55:48.860 --> 55:53.540
of lack of morals, people are not, people don't say hello to each other.

55:53.540 --> 55:58.380
There's a lot of disconnection and you see it manifest in like people live

55:58.380 --> 56:01.980
impulsively, they go towards addiction and prostitution.

56:01.980 --> 56:10.020
And then on the other side, you go to a, a temple or a very old ancient religious

56:10.100 --> 56:15.620
site and there's pristine gardens and it's quiet and it's been preserved for

56:15.620 --> 56:16.500
thousands of years.

56:16.500 --> 56:19.860
And you think, okay, maybe there's something to this.

56:20.140 --> 56:25.140
And there's a philosophical concept called a Chester's tins fence, Chester tins

56:25.140 --> 56:25.540
fence.

56:26.380 --> 56:27.060
Have you heard of this?

56:27.540 --> 56:28.020
I have.

56:28.580 --> 56:28.860
Yeah.

56:28.860 --> 56:29.900
Well, just really quick.

56:29.900 --> 56:34.020
It's, it's like you come up on a fence and you don't know why it's there.

56:34.540 --> 56:38.260
You shouldn't destroy that fence until you know it's purpose.

56:38.980 --> 56:40.460
And that's kind of what religion is.

56:40.460 --> 56:43.420
Like we're, we're coming up to religion and we're saying, oh, let's just destroy it.

56:44.180 --> 56:47.660
But we don't really know what its purpose is fully.

56:48.180 --> 56:50.020
And it's been around for thousands of years.

56:50.740 --> 56:53.900
And it's, we need to be careful if we're just going to toss it out.

56:54.500 --> 56:59.340
I heard a quote, it's, there are two types of fools, those who take religion

56:59.340 --> 57:01.820
literally and those who believe it has no value.

57:03.580 --> 57:09.780
So I kind of, that, that quote really resonated cause I think you have to have

57:09.780 --> 57:11.660
your foot in both realms.

57:13.300 --> 57:13.580
Yes.

57:13.580 --> 57:22.540
Because on either side, there's a very dogmatic belief, you know, and I'm going to

57:22.540 --> 57:27.980
say something, I'm sure it's going to upset a lot of people, but, um, you know,

57:28.900 --> 57:35.100
with the decline of religion could have been so massively avoided to specifically

57:35.100 --> 57:40.020
Christianity in America, if Christians and Christian leaders were more willing

57:40.020 --> 57:46.180
to accept, uh, people in, in, you know, in the gay and lesbian community and say

57:46.180 --> 57:50.260
to them, okay, this is, you know, sort of how you, you were born, you were born.

57:50.980 --> 57:55.980
And instead of rejecting you and calling you immoral and telling you, you know,

57:55.980 --> 58:01.860
you're going to burn in hell, which is to say, no, you know, come into the

58:01.860 --> 58:09.260
community, be who you are, but live morally, settle down with a person, adopt

58:09.260 --> 58:16.580
a child or, you know, have a child by, by some other, you know, person, but live

58:16.580 --> 58:18.500
morally and live a nice fulfilling life.

58:18.660 --> 58:19.900
Come, come be a Christian.

58:19.900 --> 58:24.260
Here's your path to being Christian, you know, and, and I know a lot of people

58:24.260 --> 58:27.740
that makes a lot of Christians unhappy, that idea, because they say, well, the

58:27.740 --> 58:29.100
Bible says this X, Y, and Z.

58:29.420 --> 58:31.780
There are a lot of things by both the Bible says that people don't want to

58:31.780 --> 58:35.100
live by people kind of, it's like what you're saying is like, you take it to

58:35.100 --> 58:36.140
literally, right?

58:36.380 --> 58:38.300
It's like the Bible also has its own limitations.

58:38.300 --> 58:39.620
It was written at certain times.

58:39.940 --> 58:44.700
And so there should be a willingness to understand when something is, is out of

58:44.700 --> 58:48.660
fashion, but can be evolved to meet modern requirements.

58:48.660 --> 58:54.220
And what happened instead, so they rejected this, this huge community and

58:54.220 --> 58:59.540
told them that you are, no matter what your immoral, no matter what, and

58:59.540 --> 59:02.900
completely turned them away, ostracized them completely.

59:03.900 --> 59:09.580
And so they said, okay, well, if I'm immoral anyway, why should I live a

59:09.580 --> 59:10.260
normal life?

59:11.060 --> 59:14.020
You know, why should I try to engage with any of your rules?

59:15.060 --> 59:18.340
And they completely, they were completely cast out into the wild.

59:18.900 --> 59:22.380
And I think that's so damaging for society, because we, at some point, we

59:22.380 --> 59:25.580
had to reconcile with that fact is that some people are gay, some people are

59:25.580 --> 59:27.340
lesbian, you have to reconcile with that fact.

59:28.220 --> 59:32.020
And, and that's the thing is that religion should, should endeavor to be at

59:32.020 --> 59:37.020
the best version of people rather than this overly solidified aspect.

59:37.020 --> 59:40.420
And same with, you know, I'm, I'm not Christian, I'm, I'm Hindu.

59:40.660 --> 59:41.780
It's the same with Hinduism too.

59:41.780 --> 59:45.580
Hinduism, you know, has made many attempts to reject a lot of things.

59:45.580 --> 59:47.540
And, oh, women should do this.

59:47.540 --> 59:50.700
And women should jump in the pyre of their dying husband.

59:50.740 --> 59:53.860
You know, there, there are a lot of limiting things that religion do.

59:53.860 --> 59:54.980
They have to evolve.

59:55.620 --> 01:00:00.100
And I think that's where we're kind of stuck is like the, you know, like

01:00:00.140 --> 01:00:05.460
all these old fashioned ideas that have persisted for thousands of years.

01:00:05.500 --> 01:00:06.940
You know, why is marriage good?

01:00:06.940 --> 01:00:11.180
All of these things, they're being upended today because everybody's like

01:00:11.260 --> 01:00:12.620
willing to question everything.

01:00:13.340 --> 01:00:14.700
Let's question everything.

01:00:15.380 --> 01:00:18.140
And the problem is that a lot of people don't know how to defend it.

01:00:18.660 --> 01:00:22.180
If, you know, it's like kind of like, if a child keeps asking you, why, why, why,

01:00:22.180 --> 01:00:24.380
why, why, why this, why that, why do I have to eat this?

01:00:24.380 --> 01:00:25.260
Why do I have to do that?

01:00:25.500 --> 01:00:27.740
And then the parent just goes eventually because I said so.

01:00:28.300 --> 01:00:31.740
You know, and, and that's sort of what society was trying to do is like, well,

01:00:31.740 --> 01:00:33.380
you, why, why should I get married?

01:00:34.220 --> 01:00:34.980
Everybody does it.

01:00:35.260 --> 01:00:35.820
Just do it.

01:00:36.700 --> 01:00:42.180
And so that those, I think we became too, we came, we, at a point that we're

01:00:42.180 --> 01:00:43.300
willing to question everything.

01:00:43.300 --> 01:00:44.740
We needed better answers.

01:00:45.700 --> 01:00:50.820
And I think that's what your channel and, you know, hopefully my channel, we're

01:00:50.820 --> 01:00:55.620
trying to do is we're trying to answer these questions of, of sort of the old

01:00:55.620 --> 01:01:00.340
fashioned values, what value do they have to the individual today?

01:01:00.340 --> 01:01:06.580
Because they persisted not because it's some nefarious plot to control the individual.

01:01:06.580 --> 01:01:11.540
They persisted because they're actually good for the individual and understanding

01:01:11.540 --> 01:01:14.140
that so that people can understand why is marriage so good?

01:01:14.140 --> 01:01:15.620
Why is monogamy so good?

01:01:16.020 --> 01:01:20.900
You know, there's that, that whole idea of, no, you know, human beings are meant

01:01:20.900 --> 01:01:25.660
to be meant, meant to be, uh, you know, polygamous and that selling monogamy,

01:01:25.660 --> 01:01:29.860
that's a very Judeo-Christian old fashioned way of controlling people, you

01:01:29.860 --> 01:01:31.180
know, that whole thing.

01:01:31.540 --> 01:01:35.220
And when that's not true at all, monogamy is actually so good for individuals

01:01:35.220 --> 01:01:36.940
and it's so good for children.

01:01:37.580 --> 01:01:43.020
And, and so understanding all of that and explaining all of that is, I think

01:01:43.020 --> 01:01:50.380
that's the way we move forward is, um, is a non, is without relying on, well,

01:01:50.380 --> 01:01:51.780
because God said so.

01:01:52.540 --> 01:01:53.540
That's why you have to do it.

01:01:53.620 --> 01:01:59.460
Instead, actually giving a thoughtful action with a thoughtful answer without

01:01:59.460 --> 01:02:05.220
having to kind of jump it up to the big man in the sky, uh, as, as, as to rely

01:02:05.220 --> 01:02:06.220
on his authority.

01:02:07.860 --> 01:02:10.060
Yeah, that's, that was beautifully put.

01:02:10.260 --> 01:02:17.620
And I've come around to see that monogamy is the best long-term strategy by

01:02:17.620 --> 01:02:22.660
far for raising families, for long-term happiness, for living life.

01:02:22.700 --> 01:02:25.780
And it's the simplest, for sure.

01:02:28.300 --> 01:02:32.460
But I can see when you're young, it's hard to see that because you want to

01:02:32.460 --> 01:02:33.460
experience everything.

01:02:34.340 --> 01:02:40.380
And you, you know, it's like if you're a prisoner in a cell, I'm like literally

01:02:40.380 --> 01:02:45.340
drawing this image right now, there's a prisoner in a cell and he can reach

01:02:45.340 --> 01:02:52.380
for the keys to open the cell or he can reach for some food and get some food.

01:02:53.180 --> 01:02:56.260
And, you know, the prisoners usually going to reach for the food.

01:02:56.700 --> 01:03:00.340
Well, the image shows him reaching for the food because it's like we want to

01:03:00.340 --> 01:03:04.060
reach for that, that instant gratification, that pleasure rather than

01:03:04.900 --> 01:03:06.620
seeing, okay, what's good for the long-term.

01:03:07.900 --> 01:03:08.260
Yeah.

01:03:08.900 --> 01:03:11.260
Yeah, you're so, that's, you're absolutely right.

01:03:11.540 --> 01:03:15.020
And I think as when you're young, you know, you're impetuous enough, but that's

01:03:15.020 --> 01:03:17.180
also important to kind of explore.

01:03:18.020 --> 01:03:20.180
Um, you don't know what you want.

01:03:20.180 --> 01:03:21.900
You're not crystallized yet.

01:03:22.220 --> 01:03:27.340
It's good to have a good dating history to try to see like, you know, what kind

01:03:27.340 --> 01:03:28.740
of person's going to gel with you.

01:03:28.740 --> 01:03:33.460
I, I'm very, uh, opposed to the idea of people getting married super young.

01:03:33.460 --> 01:03:34.900
I'm very opposed to that idea.

01:03:34.900 --> 01:03:38.420
I know that's, uh, a lot of people feel like that's the, the good approach

01:03:38.420 --> 01:03:39.820
to marriage longevity.

01:03:39.820 --> 01:03:45.060
I think, I think instead in those cases, you can sometimes hit the jackpot and

01:03:45.060 --> 01:03:48.380
other times, you know, you were kind of 45 and you wake up and you, you know,

01:03:48.380 --> 01:03:51.420
have to upend your whole life to say, I have to get out of this relationship.

01:03:51.780 --> 01:03:53.620
Which is very destructive, you know, divorce.

01:03:53.620 --> 01:03:57.340
I think honestly, hell and divorce are pretty close together.

01:03:57.460 --> 01:03:59.820
The ideas of those two, two experiences.

01:04:00.340 --> 01:04:05.580
And I think it's good to experience and then at some point to say, okay, now

01:04:05.580 --> 01:04:09.540
to move forward and kind of evolve into who I'm going to be for the, for the

01:04:09.540 --> 01:04:12.020
long haul is to, is to settle down with the person.

01:04:13.940 --> 01:04:14.740
Yeah, I agree.

01:04:14.940 --> 01:04:21.500
All said, um, yeah, there's a couple of other things I wanted to talk to you about.

01:04:22.060 --> 01:04:27.300
I think now would be a good time to talk about what is healthy masculinity.

01:04:27.460 --> 01:04:29.380
And how the femininity look like.

01:04:31.020 --> 01:04:33.060
You said femininity without struggling.

01:04:33.100 --> 01:04:34.260
I always struggle with that.

01:04:34.860 --> 01:04:35.980
That's like femininity.

01:04:36.780 --> 01:04:36.980
Yeah.

01:04:36.980 --> 01:04:38.900
I think I even wrote it with just like, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

01:04:40.860 --> 01:04:41.700
Just endless.

01:04:42.580 --> 01:04:42.940
Yeah.

01:04:43.660 --> 01:04:49.220
Um, yeah, I, uh, I think so this is what's really interesting, right?

01:04:49.220 --> 01:04:54.860
Because, um, with the way people think today, it's that if you, if you give a

01:04:54.860 --> 01:04:58.940
proper definition to something people are like well they'll think about the

01:04:58.940 --> 01:05:03.700
exceptions to that right so I want to talk about this one on a general level

01:05:03.700 --> 01:05:07.140
because it's like that's one thing that's gone out of style is pointing out

01:05:07.140 --> 01:05:11.060
that what are men like and what are women like it's like well some men can be

01:05:11.060 --> 01:05:15.220
like that and some women it can be like that it's like yeah with eight billion

01:05:15.220 --> 01:05:19.060
people there are always exceptions to everything but there's a general ideas of

01:05:19.060 --> 01:05:24.260
and there are a lot of similarities between most men and a lot of similarities

01:05:24.260 --> 01:05:28.940
between most women but there are always exceptions I think positive feminine

01:05:28.940 --> 01:05:37.660
positive masculinity to me means a person that is is oriented towards

01:05:37.660 --> 01:05:44.780
protection you know who's strong you know because men are are born to be

01:05:44.780 --> 01:05:49.620
strong to be physically strong and I think psychologically for men engaging

01:05:49.620 --> 01:05:55.100
with physical strength is actually really good for them and and I think that

01:05:55.100 --> 01:06:00.620
trend of modern life that doesn't really reward physical strength is not it's

01:06:00.620 --> 01:06:06.660
not it that's not a good thing for men I and I think encouraging men to be strong

01:06:06.660 --> 01:06:15.220
but also dangerous and capable of being dangerous but then knowing how to be

01:06:15.220 --> 01:06:22.180
gentle like that right balance of of dangerous and gentle which is why you

01:06:22.180 --> 01:06:28.060
know martial arts is such an interesting endeavor for men is because they

01:06:28.060 --> 01:06:31.540
learned that discipline of how to be really really strong but how to apply

01:06:31.540 --> 01:06:38.340
that that strength in the right frame of mind and part of that I think is is

01:06:38.340 --> 01:06:43.500
stoicism which is so I feel like it's such a misunderstood idea because people

01:06:43.540 --> 01:06:50.540
often look at stoicism like saying oh if you're stoic you reject all emotion you

01:06:50.540 --> 01:06:54.780
know you you suppress all of your emotion you don't feel anything you don't

01:06:54.780 --> 01:06:59.780
have space to feel and I think that's completely wrong the the tenant sorry

01:06:59.780 --> 01:07:05.460
about the sound the motorcycle sound but the tenant tenants of stoicism is to

01:07:05.460 --> 01:07:10.500
say one of those is what you and I were talking about earlier that you can't

01:07:10.500 --> 01:07:14.180
control what's going to happen to you you can't control what the world is

01:07:14.180 --> 01:07:17.940
going to be like what you can control is how you react to it and whether or not

01:07:17.940 --> 01:07:24.780
you allow your circumstances to destabilize your mind and so the

01:07:24.780 --> 01:07:32.260
antithesis to stoicism is someone walking into a bar and the barman calls

01:07:32.420 --> 01:07:40.620
you ma'am but you identify as as not a ma'am and you get angry and you start

01:07:40.620 --> 01:07:44.420
throwing a fit and then you go online and start crying and and making a video

01:07:44.420 --> 01:07:48.940
complaining about how much that hurt to hear that that's the antithesis of

01:07:48.940 --> 01:07:55.820
stoicism and you have allowed someone else's actions to make you deeply and

01:07:55.820 --> 01:08:01.460
happy and completely completely upend you and that's the point is that stoicism

01:08:01.460 --> 01:08:05.380
says that are you the master of your emotions or the are the emotions the

01:08:05.380 --> 01:08:09.820
master of you and I think that's a really important part of what it means to be

01:08:09.820 --> 01:08:16.220
a man because men often have to do go out and do sort of the harder physically

01:08:16.220 --> 01:08:22.260
harder things so a mastery of your emotions is really important versus let's

01:08:22.260 --> 01:08:27.740
say for a woman which you know people might take take offense at that but the

01:08:27.740 --> 01:08:32.460
reason it's so important with men is because men wield more dangerous physical

01:08:32.460 --> 01:08:38.180
power so balance of mind is really important if a man loses his cool he can

01:08:38.180 --> 01:08:42.660
cause a lot of damage to the people around him whereas a woman might just

01:08:42.660 --> 01:08:46.820
say things right but a man could actually like really hurt some people

01:08:46.820 --> 01:08:51.420
around him and so that's why I think the stoicism aspect is so important to

01:08:51.500 --> 01:08:58.940
masculinity and that his orientation his like focus is about protecting that

01:08:58.940 --> 01:09:02.980
should be about protecting the people around him whether that's his you know

01:09:02.980 --> 01:09:08.540
wife and mother and and father and daughter and son and that's what's

01:09:08.540 --> 01:09:12.140
really interesting one of the things I was looking into was the statistics up

01:09:12.140 --> 01:09:19.020
around fatherlessness and there's so much negative impact of the fatherlessness

01:09:19.020 --> 01:09:23.820
issue in our society but one of the one of the really shocking ones was that a

01:09:23.820 --> 01:09:28.700
daughter in a fatherless home is nine hundred percent more likely to be

01:09:28.700 --> 01:09:34.740
assaulted and and you know my my friend and I were talking about some some

01:09:34.740 --> 01:09:38.660
random stuff we were talking and one of the things she pointed out she was like

01:09:38.660 --> 01:09:43.060
you know when we were looking at all these Epstein things all these flight

01:09:43.060 --> 01:09:46.700
logs and all this stuff going on she said her father said the first thing

01:09:46.980 --> 01:09:53.380
her father said was where are the fathers of all those daughters like why are

01:09:53.380 --> 01:09:57.420
those daughters you know all those little young girls why are they in those

01:09:57.420 --> 01:10:03.100
situations and that's the thing is like you need a strong man to protect young

01:10:03.100 --> 01:10:10.100
girls from other nefarious men you need a strong man paying attention to that so

01:10:10.100 --> 01:10:15.980
I think that whole aspect of protection and children who come from homes where

01:10:15.980 --> 01:10:25.460
they feel protected is so crucial and I think for young men having a man model

01:10:25.460 --> 01:10:30.900
for them the importance of positive masculinity is so important because for

01:10:30.900 --> 01:10:36.860
young men they don't learn from moms just like young girls don't learn

01:10:36.860 --> 01:10:41.900
femininity from dads you know you need it to be modeled for you to understand

01:10:41.940 --> 01:10:45.620
and so that's why then you know it's important to have a coach or a teacher

01:10:45.620 --> 01:10:49.620
or someone some male influence positive male influence to tell you what's right

01:10:49.620 --> 01:10:55.820
but also to keep you in check young boys you know test the boundaries of life and

01:10:55.820 --> 01:10:59.540
they need someone that can challenge them a mother can't challenge them after

01:10:59.540 --> 01:11:04.100
a certain age but a father can forever if he's if he's taking his

01:11:04.100 --> 01:11:08.780
responsibility seriously and tell and that's one that was a really good point

01:11:08.780 --> 01:11:12.420
that Larry Elder had made when he went on the breakfast breakfast club a couple

01:11:12.420 --> 01:11:15.860
months ago he said you know I was never scared of the police what the police might

01:11:15.860 --> 01:11:19.820
do to me I was scared of what my father would do to me if I if I misbehaved and

01:11:19.820 --> 01:11:23.700
when you see the amount of youth out there you know you were mentioning kind

01:11:23.700 --> 01:11:27.940
of the city streets issues you see a lot of youth out there that's not afraid of

01:11:27.940 --> 01:11:31.780
the police they're not afraid of anybody and it's because the first person

01:11:31.780 --> 01:11:35.180
they need to be afraid of was their father as the primary discipline

01:11:35.860 --> 01:11:41.500
so I think all of those aspects are really important about that go into

01:11:41.500 --> 01:11:45.660
masculinity that end up actually really holding society together that are really

01:11:45.660 --> 01:11:51.900
crucial and then should I move on to femininity or do you want to pause here

01:11:51.900 --> 01:11:58.980
that was really beautifully said and it's the masculinity issue is it has so

01:11:58.980 --> 01:12:05.980
many sides to it yes and and you were saying that a lot of men find used to

01:12:05.980 --> 01:12:09.860
find their place in the world through physical means you know they pride

01:12:09.860 --> 01:12:15.900
themselves on being physically strong and for thousands of years that brought

01:12:15.900 --> 01:12:19.700
you a lot of value into the world or that that was your way of adding value to

01:12:19.700 --> 01:12:23.940
the world was your strength and now we're living in this modern world where

01:12:24.420 --> 01:12:30.180
your physical strength and endurance and just like your your masculine power isn't

01:12:30.180 --> 01:12:34.660
isn't quite as useful and so I think a lot of people are turning to like things

01:12:34.660 --> 01:12:39.420
like martial arts as an outlet for that but still it's not like you're going to

01:12:39.420 --> 01:12:44.740
be on the front lines doing jujitsu to defend your country right it's it's a

01:12:44.740 --> 01:12:52.260
simulation of of an ancient art but there are less and less jobs that require

01:12:52.340 --> 01:13:00.740
that masculine physical strength so I think that an important transition for

01:13:00.740 --> 01:13:09.300
men is to be there as spiritual protectors now yes yes it's it's just as

01:13:09.300 --> 01:13:15.420
important as physical protection and yeah if you abandon your children they're

01:13:15.420 --> 01:13:20.020
not going to have that spiritual protection or encouragement or guidance

01:13:20.020 --> 01:13:25.300
and yeah it it makes sense some some of those statistics that you just said

01:13:25.300 --> 01:13:29.780
that yeah without that spiritual protection you could end up in some

01:13:29.780 --> 01:13:34.220
bad situations it's a sad situation especially in San Francisco when you

01:13:34.220 --> 01:13:40.980
walk down any street and you see these people who are engaged in drug abuse

01:13:41.540 --> 01:13:47.140
and they're keeled over and I look at them sometimes and I feel like I mean I

01:13:47.140 --> 01:13:51.420
know this might make it sound like I'm trivializing the situation but I often

01:13:51.420 --> 01:13:55.540
think in movies I like make connections to certain scenes and like the

01:13:55.540 --> 01:13:59.900
emotional resonance of things kind of help stabilize accordingly to me but I

01:13:59.900 --> 01:14:04.900
thought of them and thought about Gollum and how you know one of the things he

01:14:04.900 --> 01:14:11.020
says is that I forgot the feel of of the wind I forgot the taste of food I

01:14:11.020 --> 01:14:15.860
forgot my own name and that's what it seems like to me is that they're

01:14:15.860 --> 01:14:21.420
forgotten that they're human beings and they're willing to actually let

01:14:21.420 --> 01:14:30.700
themselves be in this very sort of disjointed you know non-human state and

01:14:31.380 --> 01:14:37.500
a lot of that comes from feelings of abandonment of you know the statistics

01:14:37.500 --> 01:14:44.540
around again youths that end up you know engaged in drug abuse and running away

01:14:44.540 --> 01:14:51.180
from home and becoming homeless are pretty heavily tied to fatherless homes

01:14:51.180 --> 01:14:57.820
pretty heavily it's like 90% of youths that are on the street are are come from

01:14:58.180 --> 01:15:04.540
fatherless homes and the thing is that your mother can't abandon you a mother

01:15:04.540 --> 01:15:09.460
might that's very rare because mothers have the biological attachment we have

01:15:09.460 --> 01:15:14.540
the benefit of that first of all child is like literally part of your body and

01:15:14.540 --> 01:15:20.620
but there are also a lot of hormones and things that engage in bonding that are

01:15:20.620 --> 01:15:25.860
very very strong so it's it's almost like a given that a mother is going to be

01:15:25.860 --> 01:15:30.300
there till the day you die you know well that's a weird way to say it when you

01:15:30.300 --> 01:15:33.840
mothers rarely see their children die what am I saying I understand what you're

01:15:33.840 --> 01:15:39.500
saying you understand what I'm saying I'm losing my mind clearly mothers are

01:15:39.500 --> 01:15:45.060
there through the long haul like you said but a father has a choice whether or

01:15:45.060 --> 01:15:50.220
not to engage with his children and he can choose to walk away and when a father

01:15:50.220 --> 01:15:55.620
chooses to walk away it actually creates such a fracture for children a

01:15:55.620 --> 01:16:00.660
feeling of abandonment a feeling that they weren't good enough and that's a

01:16:00.660 --> 01:16:04.340
such a common thing by the way if you see you know in any TV show there's so

01:16:04.340 --> 01:16:09.420
many instances of characters that the father wasn't in the picture and they

01:16:09.420 --> 01:16:14.180
have all these abandonment issues as a result you know Barney from how I met

01:16:14.180 --> 01:16:18.340
your mother is an example of that you know Schmidt from New Girl is an example

01:16:18.380 --> 01:16:21.860
of that it means very common and Barney when he comes across his father and

01:16:21.860 --> 01:16:27.180
finds out that he actually has this family now and has a kid who he named

01:16:27.180 --> 01:16:32.260
after himself you know he Barney feels so he feels so terrible he was like why

01:16:32.260 --> 01:16:38.020
was wasn't I enough for you to do that for you to be there for me and so this

01:16:38.020 --> 01:16:42.300
whole idea that you know it's totally fine if a child is raised by single

01:16:42.300 --> 01:16:44.980
mothers and the reason people say that is because they don't want to hurt the

01:16:44.980 --> 01:16:48.220
feelings of single mothers they're doing a very hard job but it's actually

01:16:48.220 --> 01:16:53.740
so massive it's such a massive problem and and then you see them then on the

01:16:53.740 --> 01:16:59.860
streets and you can understand why one of the you know one half of a very

01:16:59.860 --> 01:17:03.780
important partnership that needed to make them feel like they were good enough

01:17:03.780 --> 01:17:08.260
was missing from their lives and and they didn't know how to they don't know

01:17:08.260 --> 01:17:12.620
how to manage life without that for a lot of people you know that's the that's

01:17:12.740 --> 01:17:19.580
unfortunate occurrence without a father one of my most popular videos is how

01:17:19.580 --> 01:17:26.540
childhood trauma leads to addiction by dr. Gabor mate and yeah essentially his

01:17:26.540 --> 01:17:31.700
his theory boils down to from a young age from the moment we're born

01:17:31.700 --> 01:17:37.140
attachment is our number one need if we don't stay attached to adults will die

01:17:38.060 --> 01:17:44.140
so we hold that over every other value we need to stay attached to adults and we

01:17:44.140 --> 01:17:49.300
will suppress our authenticity to stay attached and he says anytime you

01:17:49.300 --> 01:17:54.420
suppress your authenticity is when you create trauma and the more you express

01:17:54.420 --> 01:17:58.820
your authenticity the greater you will chase that feeling of attachment later

01:17:58.820 --> 01:18:04.140
in life and things like heroin I've never done it but apparently it provides

01:18:04.260 --> 01:18:10.460
that exact feeling almost that exact chemical concoction in the brain of

01:18:10.460 --> 01:18:15.780
that attachment feeling so you see some of these addicts living in what looks

01:18:15.780 --> 01:18:22.980
like hell on earth but they inject this drug and for however long they are

01:18:22.980 --> 01:18:26.180
feeling like they're bathed in love they're finally getting that hug from

01:18:26.180 --> 01:18:32.220
their parent that they've been longing for forever so that theory seemed to

01:18:32.620 --> 01:18:39.460
really sad yeah really really sad so yeah you know there's there's two ways

01:18:39.460 --> 01:18:43.100
to look at these people on the street you know a lot a lot of people see them

01:18:43.100 --> 01:18:47.780
as a problem to be solved but yeah you can also look at them as they are just

01:18:47.780 --> 01:18:52.460
the products of this environment that they didn't choose and you know if I

01:18:52.460 --> 01:18:58.540
was in that situation would I be the same maybe you know probably right yeah yeah

01:18:58.580 --> 01:19:03.700
I mean in that way you know you have to really count blessings right that are

01:19:03.700 --> 01:19:08.300
given to us and and that have helped prevent us from falling down that kind

01:19:08.300 --> 01:19:14.260
of path but to say oh I would never do that right you know but but to say like

01:19:14.260 --> 01:19:18.380
no there there are situations that you might do that you know or I might do

01:19:18.380 --> 01:19:24.140
that so I feel yeah I feel really sad for those people because it is such a

01:19:24.260 --> 01:19:29.820
misunderstood problem but it's also one that there's no sort of there's no

01:19:29.820 --> 01:19:35.660
adequate push to resolve at the moment unfortunately absolutely there's a

01:19:35.660 --> 01:19:41.820
YouTube channel called Channel 5 with Andrew Callahan I think and he just did

01:19:41.820 --> 01:19:48.620
a really good documentary about San Francisco and all the car break-ins I

01:19:48.620 --> 01:19:53.780
used to live there my car got broken into six times I lived there so this

01:19:54.380 --> 01:19:58.820
particular did they break the tiny window or did they do other things just

01:19:58.820 --> 01:20:03.020
curious they pretty much broke every window okay including the front windshield

01:20:03.020 --> 01:20:10.940
at one point so yeah it's very thorough experience them all so when I saw this

01:20:10.940 --> 01:20:14.860
topic I clicked on the video with a lot of emotion like yeah we got to get rid

01:20:14.860 --> 01:20:20.740
of these these people they're like parasites that are going around causing

01:20:20.860 --> 01:20:26.940
chaos with no ramifications they need to be stopped and he did such a great job

01:20:26.940 --> 01:20:30.780
reporting he finally meets one of these guys that breaks into the cars and he

01:20:30.780 --> 01:20:35.260
follows him around for an entire day and gets to know him really well and by the

01:20:35.260 --> 01:20:39.380
end I'm feeling really bad for this guy like he has a kid that he hasn't seen

01:20:39.380 --> 01:20:43.620
and he wants to see him and he's he's got no options he's hooked on these

01:20:43.620 --> 01:20:49.820
fentanyl and he's been abandoned kind of kind of like the typical tragic story

01:20:50.100 --> 01:20:56.140
and by the end you're like my god like I could have been this guy if I was in

01:20:56.140 --> 01:21:02.860
that situation you know you can't it's hard to judge at that point hmm wow okay

01:21:02.860 --> 01:21:08.740
I definitely need to watch that because you know I I can have empathy and then

01:21:08.740 --> 01:21:12.940
there are moments of frustration where I kind of find myself completely outside

01:21:12.940 --> 01:21:19.700
of that and very angry and I think I need to recalibrate a little bit you

01:21:19.700 --> 01:21:27.580
know yeah there's an idea that we don't have any free will that I don't fully

01:21:27.580 --> 01:21:32.580
agree with but it there's a lot of logic to it that you know we are products of

01:21:32.580 --> 01:21:36.420
our environment yeah all these variables go into everything is cause and effect

01:21:36.420 --> 01:21:41.060
right and I think the value in in seeing that argument though is that you don't

01:21:41.060 --> 01:21:46.420
hold blame on people as much as you would if you didn't know that idea because

01:21:46.700 --> 01:21:53.060
when you see somebody committed atrocity you can kind of see alright at one

01:21:53.060 --> 01:21:57.500
at one point this person was a baby and they just got fumbled around in the

01:21:57.500 --> 01:22:02.300
wrong way and you you don't you don't hold that resentment in your heart

01:22:02.300 --> 01:22:07.660
towards them yeah if you know that idea yeah of course there are lines that you

01:22:07.660 --> 01:22:10.900
have to set and there are boundaries that have to be drawn so you can't just be

01:22:10.900 --> 01:22:15.980
indifferent on everything right but I think it's helpful to have that idea in

01:22:15.980 --> 01:22:20.140
your mind as well yeah you you know that completely makes sense because it's not

01:22:20.140 --> 01:22:24.980
like they got they have no free will but there is and they need to have some

01:22:24.980 --> 01:22:30.220
level of positive influence to at least help them see what's a good path for

01:22:30.220 --> 01:22:33.820
them of how they can create a better life but if they never get that

01:22:33.820 --> 01:22:37.900
opportunity how could they see it's not like we're born with any kind of

01:22:37.900 --> 01:22:44.420
inherent understanding of good we we have we have some level of where we can

01:22:44.420 --> 01:22:48.900
engage oh this is a good thing to do and this is not but it takes a lot of

01:22:48.900 --> 01:22:54.740
thought and and sort of exploration to get to that it's not kind of built in

01:22:54.740 --> 01:22:59.700
absolutely yeah well I guess we should probably round this segment out with the

01:22:59.700 --> 01:23:09.340
feminine femininity side yes so let's do it positive femininity look like so I

01:23:09.500 --> 01:23:14.580
think femininity is not about physical strength that's not to say that some

01:23:14.580 --> 01:23:18.380
women aren't physically strong and if that's what they are interested in I

01:23:18.380 --> 01:23:26.740
think femininity is about a different sort of emotional and mental strength it

01:23:26.740 --> 01:23:39.100
takes a lot to first of all walk around as as a sort of a weaker weaker part of

01:23:39.100 --> 01:23:47.660
society in a lot of ways if I'm just going about my day I have to make sure

01:23:47.660 --> 01:23:52.820
I'm thinking about where I might be putting myself at risk and I have I

01:23:52.820 --> 01:23:56.100
have responsibility to myself and my loved ones to make sure that I don't

01:23:56.140 --> 01:24:00.740
put myself in situations where I'm at risk and in those cases it's it is this

01:24:00.740 --> 01:24:09.300
weird relationship that every woman has with men where a man at on an empty

01:24:09.300 --> 01:24:13.580
street dark street could be your perpetrator or your savior it could be

01:24:13.580 --> 01:24:17.740
either you know you don't know you might either be really happy to see him or

01:24:17.740 --> 01:24:24.820
really sad to see him and I think that one of those important aspects of being

01:24:25.060 --> 01:24:29.540
a woman is to be very responsible and I mean and this is one of those things

01:24:29.540 --> 01:24:33.740
that women modern women really hate this idea but there's a reason why women

01:24:33.740 --> 01:24:40.620
mature faster is because we first of all puberty for women it means we are

01:24:40.620 --> 01:24:45.660
inundated with a lot of negative emotion which I recall that moment and

01:24:45.660 --> 01:24:51.340
suddenly I went from being a very happy child to very sad all the time and you

01:24:51.340 --> 01:24:56.420
know we had our we have our initiation into womanhood that men don't have you

01:24:56.420 --> 01:25:01.060
know we we know when we're suddenly women we have we actually have a very

01:25:01.060 --> 01:25:07.780
strong bookend for that or sorry like I guess not a bookend but transition for

01:25:07.780 --> 01:25:13.980
that and that means suddenly you're looked at differently you have to behave

01:25:13.980 --> 01:25:17.420
differently you have to you have to be a lot more thoughtful and how you're

01:25:17.420 --> 01:25:24.940
presenting yourself to the world and I think part of that is also then how you

01:25:24.940 --> 01:25:30.860
engage with men and how you allow men to look at you this is something I feel

01:25:30.860 --> 01:25:37.140
very strongly about but I think about it's very important for positive

01:25:37.140 --> 01:25:42.900
femininity to be about imposing lines on with how like boundaries around how

01:25:42.900 --> 01:25:51.260
men engage with you and and converse with you relate with you and you know

01:25:51.260 --> 01:25:53.940
this was something that when I was growing up it was a good thing I'd

01:25:53.940 --> 01:25:59.380
grown up on books like Pride and Prejudice and you know Emily Bronte's

01:25:59.380 --> 01:26:03.420
books like I had I grew up on kind of very old-fashioned perspectives on on

01:26:03.420 --> 01:26:08.460
the feminine and when I got to college and every man thought that it was

01:26:08.460 --> 01:26:14.940
perfectly acceptable to get my affection or my time by just sending me a

01:26:14.940 --> 01:26:25.380
you-up text was so angering that that's what passed as as modern romance and I

01:26:25.380 --> 01:26:31.340
found it so deeply offensive that that it was perfectly acceptable that a man

01:26:31.340 --> 01:26:36.340
could look at me like a commodity that he could get at the end of the night just

01:26:36.340 --> 01:26:39.620
by sent you know either buying me a drink or sending me something like that

01:26:39.620 --> 01:26:49.100
and I think forget about what anybody thinks on an individual level as a woman

01:26:49.100 --> 01:26:54.580
you will live a much better life if you have a strong control on how people how

01:26:54.580 --> 01:27:01.580
people how much people sexualize and commodify you and you know and this is

01:27:01.580 --> 01:27:05.380
something I could talk about honestly endlessly but the the the biggest

01:27:05.380 --> 01:27:11.860
difference the biggest impact is kind of how how if if you set a boundary on how

01:27:11.860 --> 01:27:16.180
other people treat you you also end up really ensuring that you you treat

01:27:16.180 --> 01:27:21.820
yourself properly that you respect yourself it's really easy again coming

01:27:21.820 --> 01:27:26.300
back to that like people kind of rushing to whatever is easy today it's a

01:27:26.300 --> 01:27:31.560
really easy for me to monetize myself on my body I could start an only fans to

01:27:31.560 --> 01:27:35.200
tomorrow I have a YouTube channel I could tell them hey I'm starting an only

01:27:35.200 --> 01:27:40.280
fans and I could be making money I mean I'm like whatever looking whatever but I

01:27:40.280 --> 01:27:44.040
could do that because it's really easy for a woman to make money by commodifying

01:27:44.040 --> 01:27:48.600
herself but does that mean that you're gonna be endlessly happy is that in

01:27:48.600 --> 01:27:52.440
respect yourself and have healthy relationships with opposite sex or your

01:27:52.440 --> 01:27:56.400
children or your parents absolutely not it's because you are telling someone

01:27:56.400 --> 01:28:00.080
else that they can buy your body and that's how that's how the world is gonna

01:28:00.080 --> 01:28:07.040
treat you they're gonna treat your body like a commodity so I think that sort of

01:28:07.040 --> 01:28:12.160
conservative approach to how you let the world talk to you is really really

01:28:12.160 --> 01:28:18.240
healthy for on an individual level for a woman and then the other aspect of it is

01:28:18.240 --> 01:28:23.560
like what's your responsibility to the opposite sex let's say your husband or

01:28:23.560 --> 01:28:27.040
your part you know your your male partner specifically we're talking about men

01:28:27.040 --> 01:28:34.080
and women here I think men unfortunately don't have a lot of opportunity to have

01:28:34.080 --> 01:28:39.800
an outlet for their emotion I think partly societal and partly I think it's

01:28:39.800 --> 01:28:49.800
just how men sort of prefer to be and I think being that sort of sort of creating

01:28:49.800 --> 01:28:56.640
that space for your husband or your boyfriend or whoever to have an outlet

01:28:56.640 --> 01:29:02.600
and talk to you and share with you sort of all of their insecurities and fears

01:29:02.600 --> 01:29:07.480
and and giving them that opportunity to do so without having ramifications or

01:29:07.480 --> 01:29:11.320
like you know reputation issues or punishing them is really important

01:29:11.320 --> 01:29:15.040
because we women are really good at that and this is something I didn't really

01:29:15.040 --> 01:29:19.920
realize until until I was married so I you know I'm I have a brother but I

01:29:19.920 --> 01:29:25.440
honestly didn't understand this until I got married was that you know my husband

01:29:25.440 --> 01:29:30.200
talks to his father about his issues or he talks to me but that's but that's it

01:29:30.200 --> 01:29:36.440
I talked to my husband I talked to my dad I talked to my mom I talked to my

01:29:36.440 --> 01:29:39.920
brother I talked to my sister-in-law I talked to my friend I for talked to my

01:29:39.920 --> 01:29:44.240
other friend I talked to my other friend I have endless sources of places where I

01:29:44.240 --> 01:29:47.560
actually have an outlet for my emotions and my issues and all of that and

01:29:47.560 --> 01:29:52.440
everybody you know receives it and says go go ahead you cry you feel it all of

01:29:52.440 --> 01:29:56.160
that and I noticed that with my husband he he doesn't have a lot of those like

01:29:56.160 --> 01:30:00.800
he's not he's not even willing to do that but it's like he actually doesn't

01:30:00.800 --> 01:30:05.840
have adequate outlets for that and that's one one of those aspects I think is

01:30:05.840 --> 01:30:09.560
really important is that if men are going to be those like spiritual

01:30:09.560 --> 01:30:12.760
protectors like you were talking about and I love that idea that concept of

01:30:12.760 --> 01:30:17.520
spiritual protective it's so important that they also need to have a place where

01:30:17.520 --> 01:30:24.120
they can be weak and have an outlet for that emotion and I think that's really

01:30:24.120 --> 01:30:30.040
important for women to do that and you know modern women hate it being told

01:30:30.040 --> 01:30:34.160
like we need to do this for our husbands like it's like that's like you know

01:30:34.160 --> 01:30:39.320
this absolutely loads some idea to say to a woman these days but just like men

01:30:39.320 --> 01:30:44.960
oh women things and for us to say oh husband should endeavor to do this for

01:30:44.960 --> 01:30:47.720
his wife that's a good thing we say oh that's a good thing yes husbands should

01:30:47.720 --> 01:30:51.360
do things for their wives but that's the same thing is that you know we women

01:30:51.360 --> 01:30:56.080
have responsibilities as well and I think our emotional intelligence is our

01:30:56.080 --> 01:31:00.480
greatest strength our ability to to comfort to care for I mean that we

01:31:00.480 --> 01:31:04.520
should not we should not reject those ideas that's that's our greatest strength

01:31:04.520 --> 01:31:11.320
the whole the whole foundation of family is built on a woman that's willing to

01:31:11.320 --> 01:31:18.240
build a good family but the protection and safety and ultimate success of the

01:31:18.240 --> 01:31:22.800
family is based on a husband and his willingness to protect his family and I

01:31:22.800 --> 01:31:29.720
think in that way is where you partner up and create this really strong connection

01:31:29.720 --> 01:31:37.880
between the best of both sexes for you know ultimate success I was beautifully

01:31:37.920 --> 01:31:44.680
put you keep giving me a lot to think about and I'm taking notes here I did a

01:31:44.680 --> 01:31:51.760
video this summer to try to clarify sex and gender it was a big video and I

01:31:51.760 --> 01:31:58.000
knew it would be risky to make but we I worked with Heather Hying and Brett

01:31:58.000 --> 01:32:03.680
Weinstein oh what what I mean what a great partnership there so they look at

01:32:03.680 --> 01:32:09.480
this entire issue from a evolutionary biology lens and it was really

01:32:09.480 --> 01:32:14.000
interesting to just look at it through that lens but when you take it down to

01:32:14.000 --> 01:32:20.560
like the sperm and the egg you have thousands and thousands of sperm

01:32:20.560 --> 01:32:25.600
competing competing for that one egg and that translates to our behavior in the

01:32:25.600 --> 01:32:29.960
real world men typically are more focused on what happens before

01:32:30.120 --> 01:32:34.520
reproduction whereas women are more focused on what happens after reproduction

01:32:34.520 --> 01:32:39.400
because they have to take care of the child whereas men so you typically see

01:32:39.400 --> 01:32:45.360
men competing a lot more and they're fighting with with each other for a

01:32:45.360 --> 01:32:52.320
mate and it is the woman's job to be a filter and to be selective and I think

01:32:52.320 --> 01:32:57.800
that manifests in what we value in men and women like we it's really seen as

01:32:57.840 --> 01:33:04.440
valuable for a man to be able to provide because that sets him competitively that

01:33:04.440 --> 01:33:09.080
sets him out from the herd and it also shows that he could be an asset after

01:33:09.080 --> 01:33:14.800
the child is born he can create a stable environment for that child down the

01:33:14.800 --> 01:33:24.240
road whereas what men value in women is fertility but also a big thing that you

01:33:24.240 --> 01:33:29.800
were speaking on that often gets overlooked is the ability to be selective

01:33:29.800 --> 01:33:36.440
the ability to be that filter which is the ability to set boundaries and say

01:33:36.440 --> 01:33:43.680
no and so if a woman shows that she's able to say no her value goes way up in

01:33:43.680 --> 01:33:51.080
the eyes of men and yes that that only fans life is very alluring it's right

01:33:51.120 --> 01:33:57.320
there it's that instant gratification and it's it can be hard to say no to it but

01:33:57.320 --> 01:34:04.640
the second you do that you completely lose that filter that value and you can

01:34:04.640 --> 01:34:10.040
never get it back yeah which is something you know feminism is trying to

01:34:10.040 --> 01:34:14.480
change that so fourth wave feminism I think we're evolving past fourth wave and

01:34:14.480 --> 01:34:19.120
into fifth wave I don't know when they'll make that declaration but I think

01:34:19.120 --> 01:34:24.840
you know fourth wave was all about sort of DV a DEI and and actual like I think

01:34:24.840 --> 01:34:31.360
at fourth wave they've achieved a lot of success by actually infiltrating HR

01:34:31.360 --> 01:34:36.840
departments and writer rooms and they you know that they've gotten some level

01:34:36.840 --> 01:34:41.480
of critical critical mass but fifth wave if we could make that argument that

01:34:41.480 --> 01:34:48.440
we're entering that is might I lose my train of thought fifth wave like a fifth

01:34:48.440 --> 01:34:54.520
wave do we even have women anymore or is that concept just become relative yeah

01:34:54.520 --> 01:35:00.360
no that I think so the whole breakdown of the definition of woman really happened

01:35:00.360 --> 01:35:06.560
at the third wave but we didn't hear about it until the fourth wave because

01:35:06.560 --> 01:35:12.040
the the whole third wave was based on intersectionality as well as this book

01:35:12.040 --> 01:35:17.040
that Judith Butler I always find it hard to say her name but Judith Butler who is

01:35:17.040 --> 01:35:21.480
it who is a professor at UC Berkeley wrote this book called gender trouble

01:35:21.480 --> 01:35:28.680
where she sort of brought to popularity the concept of gender roles you know

01:35:28.680 --> 01:35:33.200
being something that you could jump between sorry gender and sex being

01:35:33.200 --> 01:35:38.480
something you could jump between that it could and you know she hers she

01:35:38.480 --> 01:35:44.320
identified as non-binary so prefers to go by a day so it really got

01:35:44.320 --> 01:35:48.000
introduced then but what was the thing you said sorry what was the last thing

01:35:48.000 --> 01:35:53.040
you had said right before was it about fifth wave and how we're just gonna get

01:35:53.040 --> 01:35:56.400
so relative that we're gonna lose the definitions of everything but right

01:35:56.400 --> 01:36:01.080
before that what was like the point I was talking about women are the filter

01:36:01.360 --> 01:36:06.880
oh and only fans yes okay so now I cut it sorry that fifth wave is gonna is

01:36:06.880 --> 01:36:12.720
really gonna be about finalizing this concept that sex work is just regular

01:36:12.720 --> 01:36:20.040
work and that commodifying of the of the body is totally fine and I think part

01:36:20.040 --> 01:36:26.160
of that is already in motion there's a lot of push for the destigmatization of

01:36:26.240 --> 01:36:31.480
adult industry work because women are the ones you know they say that suffer

01:36:31.480 --> 01:36:35.480
the consequences for that for good reasons as you've explained and I

01:36:35.480 --> 01:36:39.560
completely agree with all of those which is that it's you know a filtration

01:36:39.560 --> 01:36:45.480
system for a woman is far more important than for a man and that's the big push

01:36:45.480 --> 01:36:50.400
that women are suffering for having to engage with the adult industry because

01:36:50.400 --> 01:36:55.880
you know due to limited economic issue you know resources that a woman might

01:36:55.880 --> 01:36:59.440
turn to something like only fans and then she's ostracized for the rest of her

01:36:59.440 --> 01:37:04.160
life and that should not be allowed why is it that men are not and and when men

01:37:04.160 --> 01:37:08.640
are the main consumers of something like that why is that not why is that not

01:37:08.640 --> 01:37:13.320
forgiven for women or even not even considered for women and the other thing

01:37:13.320 --> 01:37:22.240
that's going to happen is going to be the overhauling of woman you know that

01:37:22.240 --> 01:37:27.080
idea of woman bearing children I think that's going to be the next push is

01:37:27.080 --> 01:37:31.320
going to be that oh well we should just be relying on science to bear children

01:37:31.320 --> 01:37:37.320
and that even a surrogate is totally fine that's going to be the next push

01:37:37.320 --> 01:37:43.440
policy-wise which in America is a lot more lenient but in other countries it's

01:37:43.440 --> 01:37:48.360
considered a pretty pretty difficult thing to accept because what you're doing

01:37:48.360 --> 01:37:53.160
through surrogacy and this is something Louise Perry talks a lot about that she

01:37:53.160 --> 01:37:56.840
talks about how you know you're intentionally breaking a very important

01:37:56.840 --> 01:38:00.720
bond between mother and child and I'm sure Gabor Maté would have a lot to say

01:38:00.720 --> 01:38:05.040
about that as well because you know that that there's a lot of trauma attached to

01:38:05.080 --> 01:38:12.360
that because you know the baby the first heartbeat that he or she hears is the

01:38:12.360 --> 01:38:15.800
mother's heartbeat the smell I mean the baby doesn't even for the first couple

01:38:15.800 --> 01:38:19.760
for a long time doesn't even feel like they're apart from the mother right even

01:38:19.760 --> 01:38:23.000
after being born they feel like the mother's body is their body it's like a

01:38:23.000 --> 01:38:27.360
very deep connection that you intentionally break through surrogacy so

01:38:27.360 --> 01:38:33.000
I think there's a lot of moral questions that people are going to try to raise

01:38:33.040 --> 01:38:37.200
that you know the next wave of feminism is going to say no well you know it's

01:38:37.200 --> 01:38:42.200
totally fine to farm out someone some other woman's body for for my

01:38:42.200 --> 01:38:45.720
particular needs or your particular needs that should be totally okay and

01:38:45.720 --> 01:38:49.080
consider a regular transaction and that's that's really what is we're

01:38:49.080 --> 01:38:53.720
looking at is that general commodification of the female body and

01:38:53.720 --> 01:39:00.840
and and that being totally okay well yeah if we're gonna take it to the future

01:39:00.880 --> 01:39:06.680
trajectory yeah I think we're not that far away from AI porn and things like

01:39:06.680 --> 01:39:16.160
that so yeah it'll yeah the the the competition may be with these AI porn

01:39:16.160 --> 01:39:20.560
bots and that's gonna be hard to compete with because those things are gonna

01:39:20.560 --> 01:39:26.000
have no taboos but those things will be able to go to the wildest fantasy and

01:39:26.000 --> 01:39:32.120
beyond yeah and I don't think any human would be able to compete with that so

01:39:32.120 --> 01:39:37.560
perhaps we're gonna go so full cycle we're gonna go all the way around or you

01:39:37.560 --> 01:39:41.840
know every sex work is gonna be incentivized and then it's gonna be just

01:39:41.840 --> 01:39:46.080
like we can't compete with these AI bots let's just go back to having like

01:39:46.080 --> 01:39:54.500
peaceful civil romance yeah I'm being optimistic maybe it'll just get so

01:39:54.540 --> 01:40:00.780
chaotic that I'm done with this I'm getting off this train yeah I I actually

01:40:00.780 --> 01:40:04.900
think that I don't think we're headed in into a dark future I think things are

01:40:04.900 --> 01:40:09.860
really dark now and are likely to be for a little bit but I don't think our

01:40:09.860 --> 01:40:18.580
future is dark I think I think we're in a very difficult transition period where

01:40:18.620 --> 01:40:25.180
we've lost that like I was saying that that man in the sky to tell us what to

01:40:25.180 --> 01:40:30.700
do and we've overextended individual freedom so much that we feel completely

01:40:30.700 --> 01:40:36.420
spiritually lost and now I think it's going to be about bringing things back

01:40:36.420 --> 01:40:42.660
together hopefully but without reliance on on because God said so but instead

01:40:42.660 --> 01:40:47.700
because this is what's good for everybody I think we're gonna build a new

01:40:47.740 --> 01:40:51.300
morality system is what I think is going to happen because it's kind of

01:40:51.300 --> 01:40:57.620
already happening you know the idea that porn is bad for you if if you said

01:40:57.620 --> 01:41:02.540
that five years ago or ten years ago people would be like shut up who cares

01:41:02.540 --> 01:41:09.940
you know no it's not and now that actually that idea is is taking hold

01:41:09.940 --> 01:41:14.980
people are understanding why porn is so bad for you and many people are

01:41:15.020 --> 01:41:19.220
choosing to stay away from it completely stay away from it same with

01:41:19.220 --> 01:41:26.380
alcohol same with birth control you know birth control is just considered this

01:41:26.380 --> 01:41:31.540
magic thing and now there's so much awareness being spread that birth

01:41:31.540 --> 01:41:36.340
control is actually devastating to your hormones and that you should

01:41:36.340 --> 01:41:40.940
absolutely get away from it and many people are resentful that their doctors

01:41:40.940 --> 01:41:44.740
their primary care physicians didn't warn them about the side effects that

01:41:44.820 --> 01:41:48.500
they could expect because a lot of people women felt suicidal on it emotional on

01:41:48.500 --> 01:41:54.220
it still do and and then the impact on it later is is after once once you get

01:41:54.220 --> 01:41:59.020
off of it is also pretty pretty big but again people like Andrew Huberman you

01:41:59.020 --> 01:42:05.020
know is shedding a lot of light on stuff like that so I think we're and and even

01:42:05.020 --> 01:42:08.460
fatherlessness now that's like a big conversation that we're having right I

01:42:09.020 --> 01:42:16.820
think it's all sort of gone from research to entering the the general

01:42:16.820 --> 01:42:22.340
conversation and now it's just going to spread from here and there's this whole

01:42:22.340 --> 01:42:30.340
slice of society that's so intent upon making themselves as great as possible

01:42:30.340 --> 01:42:34.100
and I think they watch your channels like yours they watch channels like Chris

01:42:34.180 --> 01:42:40.660
Williamson like and Andrew Huberman Brett Weinstein and Jordan Peterson and

01:42:40.660 --> 01:42:47.780
they they are intent upon building a good life for themselves that's you know

01:42:47.780 --> 01:42:52.700
without caffeine or like full of workouts and and you know thinking about their

01:42:52.700 --> 01:42:57.700
problems and not you know suppressing them it's like all these great things and

01:42:57.700 --> 01:43:01.740
then also understanding their moral code or understanding the value of

01:43:01.740 --> 01:43:07.180
religion I mean how many people watched Jordan Peterson's lecture on on Genesis

01:43:07.180 --> 01:43:13.220
and then his seminar on on Exodus I mean people are engaging that without being

01:43:13.220 --> 01:43:17.420
religious themselves and they're seeing that kind of like the Chesterton's

01:43:17.420 --> 01:43:21.540
fence thing is that you know religion has its values you don't have to turn

01:43:21.540 --> 01:43:29.020
into a dogmatic you know person who's going and looking down at everybody for

01:43:29.420 --> 01:43:32.900
believing certain not believe not believing certain ideas which is what

01:43:32.900 --> 01:43:37.620
religion really turned into for a lot of people is that it became this tool for

01:43:37.620 --> 01:43:40.620
their ego and to beat down on other people and tell them they're going to

01:43:40.620 --> 01:43:47.260
hell but no religion has individual value that's so that's so wonderful and I

01:43:47.260 --> 01:43:50.500
think it's all about taking the ego out of it and I think that's going to be the

01:43:50.500 --> 01:43:53.940
new form of morality that's going to burgeon up it's going to be an

01:43:53.940 --> 01:43:59.500
intellectual morality and and and so I I'm very hopeful that a lot of things

01:43:59.500 --> 01:44:05.780
are going to turn around that's that's brilliant yeah I love what you just said

01:44:05.780 --> 01:44:11.260
and I think we've now had enough time to see the second order effects of a lot of

01:44:11.260 --> 01:44:14.780
things that we thought were like the solutions to be all and all solutions and

01:44:14.780 --> 01:44:20.460
now we're saying okay 20 years later what's the second order effects of all

01:44:20.460 --> 01:44:24.020
these antidepressants we've given everybody yeah what's the second order

01:44:24.020 --> 01:44:30.580
effects of all the ADHD medication we've given out birth control you know we're

01:44:30.580 --> 01:44:34.980
now starting to see oh wow there you know you there's nothing no such thing as a

01:44:34.980 --> 01:44:40.980
free lunch we know there's there's an impact there's unintended consequences

01:44:40.980 --> 01:44:45.940
to everything so unfortunately we're still doing things right now where we're

01:44:45.940 --> 01:44:51.020
gonna see down the line the second order effects but I think a lot of people

01:44:51.020 --> 01:44:56.140
that are optimistic enough to be parents in this modern world are going to have

01:44:56.140 --> 01:45:00.540
the tools now to teach their kids about second order effects instead of saying

01:45:00.540 --> 01:45:04.780
hey no you can't do that hey don't watch porn no matter what you're not allowed

01:45:04.780 --> 01:45:07.860
to and they say why and you're like I don't know it's bad instead of saying

01:45:07.860 --> 01:45:12.580
that you could lay out a path and say look down the line this is how it affects

01:45:12.580 --> 01:45:18.460
you and this is how it'll derail your entire life so it depends on what you

01:45:18.460 --> 01:45:23.940
want if you want a family and a successful career and to be fit you can't

01:45:23.940 --> 01:45:28.380
get derailed in this way yeah but if your goal is just to be derailed or if

01:45:28.380 --> 01:45:34.660
you don't have a goal then by all means go down these impulsive paths yes but I

01:45:34.660 --> 01:45:39.220
think it's having the ability to lay that out for a next generation is really

01:45:39.220 --> 01:45:45.060
important so that they have like a healthy compass of the world because like

01:45:45.060 --> 01:45:49.780
in Genesis the first one of the first stories it is human nature to want to

01:45:49.780 --> 01:45:53.540
do what we're not allowed to that's like the first thing humans want to do God

01:45:53.540 --> 01:45:57.220
puts Adam and Eve on earth and says don't eat that fruit first thing they're

01:45:57.220 --> 01:46:01.460
gonna do is eat it so right you know maybe if he explained what happens if you

01:46:01.460 --> 01:46:06.180
eat it they would have chosen differently yeah yeah and my husband or I

01:46:06.260 --> 01:46:10.700
talking about that because he recently gave up alcohol I say recently but it's

01:46:10.700 --> 01:46:14.420
been more than a year and it's funny because every time he tells people that

01:46:14.420 --> 01:46:19.860
he gave up alcohol people say well were you an alcoholic you know it's like

01:46:19.860 --> 01:46:23.740
they assume that you had this major problem and that's why you had to give

01:46:23.740 --> 01:46:29.420
it up when he just realized like I just didn't feel good with it and and one of

01:46:29.420 --> 01:46:32.700
the things he was thinking about is like oh when we have kids at least I feel

01:46:32.700 --> 01:46:38.420
more now emboldened and empowered with with information to say why you should

01:46:38.420 --> 01:46:42.620
not drink alcohol or have a healthy relationship with it at least but that

01:46:42.620 --> 01:46:46.860
when he was growing up it was just like because I said so and same with me and

01:46:46.860 --> 01:46:52.140
the ideas around modesty I grew up in a very modest household I grew up you know

01:46:52.140 --> 01:46:57.300
and I took to it I wasn't really rebellious about it I actually felt

01:46:57.300 --> 01:47:04.020
like it actually felt kind of natural to me to be modest and but as I grew up it

01:47:04.020 --> 01:47:07.300
started to make sense to me and I of course tested a lot of the theories out

01:47:07.300 --> 01:47:13.020
when I was in college because I did want to have my rebellious time but I had to

01:47:13.020 --> 01:47:18.060
like stumble into the understanding of why me treating my body as something

01:47:18.060 --> 01:47:21.660
that was sacred was important for my mental health and for me to actually

01:47:21.660 --> 01:47:25.020
have a very successful relationship then in the future with whoever I ended up

01:47:25.020 --> 01:47:30.060
with forever is that then he also knew that I had treated my body as very

01:47:30.060 --> 01:47:38.180
sacred and wasn't so it was it took time to understand that and now and and now

01:47:38.180 --> 01:47:42.380
you know you have writers like Louis Louis Perry explaining the ideas of why

01:47:42.380 --> 01:47:47.100
modesty is so important or you know you shouldn't get drunk around you know

01:47:47.100 --> 01:47:50.580
these in these like frat parties of because of what kind of impact that

01:47:50.580 --> 01:47:56.060
might have on you and she does it all without lending to religion at all and

01:47:56.060 --> 01:48:02.060
and if she had you know I don't think it's wrong to rely on religion but I

01:48:02.060 --> 01:48:06.900
think people feel like religion is an incomplete answer to them and so it's

01:48:06.900 --> 01:48:10.620
like she's instead explaining like the full path of it and bringing it back to

01:48:10.620 --> 01:48:14.580
the individuals like what exactly happens you know if you if you engage in

01:48:14.580 --> 01:48:18.980
in one path versus another I think we're just getting those like very detailed

01:48:18.980 --> 01:48:23.980
answers to things yeah we're very lucky right now where we're living in this age

01:48:23.980 --> 01:48:28.820
of we have so much access to information yes I'm so grateful to people like

01:48:28.820 --> 01:48:33.740
Jordan Peterson who are taking all these incredible philosophers and old texts

01:48:33.740 --> 01:48:38.300
and he's filtering it down into such an easy way to understand and same with

01:48:38.300 --> 01:48:43.540
religious texts too yeah it's because of Jordan Peterson that I've looked into

01:48:43.540 --> 01:48:48.540
Carl Jung and Victor Frankel and all these other philosophers that you know

01:48:48.580 --> 01:48:51.460
you hear him mention a name enough times you're like okay I should probably

01:48:51.460 --> 01:48:56.700
check out that book yeah and it's he's really been like well I guess you could

01:48:56.700 --> 01:49:02.300
bring it down to like Joe Rogan Joe Rogan led me to him and then he led me to

01:49:02.300 --> 01:49:07.140
like 20 other great philosophers and I keep going down this rabbit hole now I'm

01:49:07.140 --> 01:49:12.940
like getting into these very obscure ancient occult type things and I'm like

01:49:12.940 --> 01:49:21.660
wow yeah okay is this an okay time for me to tell you about a bit Bushina do you

01:49:21.660 --> 01:49:26.380
want to do you want to talk about that yeah because I think I think it it's a

01:49:26.380 --> 01:49:35.620
good wrap on everything as well so I told you this but I at the end of last

01:49:35.620 --> 01:49:42.820
year went for a 10-day silent retreat it's called the Bushina where you live

01:49:42.860 --> 01:49:48.780
like a monk for 10 days you don't you have certain precepts like morality

01:49:48.780 --> 01:49:52.580
precepts that you have to follow for example you don't engage in misconduct

01:49:52.580 --> 01:49:56.620
you don't lie for those 10 days you're sort of taking this oath you don't kill

01:49:56.620 --> 01:50:00.900
anything so even if there's an insect in your room they have like a little way

01:50:00.900 --> 01:50:03.980
for you to take it out so you don't kill the insects you're eating vegetarian

01:50:03.980 --> 01:50:11.260
food but specifically it's through this organization called it's maybe it's called

01:50:11.300 --> 01:50:21.940
just dhamma d-h-a-m-m-a and it follows it follows the precepts set by Buddhism

01:50:21.940 --> 01:50:27.300
like Buddha specifically from you know centuries ago and Buddha himself

01:50:27.300 --> 01:50:32.620
discovered this practice when he was meditating and he discovered it based on

01:50:32.620 --> 01:50:37.140
ancient Indian texts that were sort of lost so he rediscovered this technique

01:50:37.140 --> 01:50:42.980
and then he crystallized it into this method of 10 days of meditation that

01:50:42.980 --> 01:50:48.060
help you achieve start to achieve sort of an understanding of your path to

01:50:48.060 --> 01:50:55.100
enlightenment and my friend convinced me to do this I was a very very skeptical

01:50:55.100 --> 01:50:59.340
she's been trying to convince me for 10 years but the idea of being in silence

01:50:59.340 --> 01:51:04.820
and without any access to you know my material world felt very frightening to

01:51:04.820 --> 01:51:11.380
me and I'm so glad I went she finally convinced me and I went and the the

01:51:11.380 --> 01:51:15.420
whole idea is that it's actually completely free and they don't even let

01:51:15.420 --> 01:51:22.700
you donate before you take a course so that's actually part of the mechanism

01:51:22.700 --> 01:51:27.740
to get you into the right mindset which is that you are here with all this room

01:51:27.740 --> 01:51:34.460
and board and and food that's being served to you is you're here on the by

01:51:34.460 --> 01:51:38.540
the grace of other people's charity other ex-students have paid for for your

01:51:38.540 --> 01:51:43.980
ability to be here and that alone that's that begins that sort of humility

01:51:43.980 --> 01:51:52.140
practice to help you recognize that you need to then maybe this is a good time

01:51:52.140 --> 01:51:56.980
to sort of rethink your approach to life because you know modern life we're

01:51:56.980 --> 01:52:00.980
relying on ourselves we go out and about like I pay for my lunch you know

01:52:00.980 --> 01:52:05.980
I'm I've been relying on myself for for you know better part of you know 20

01:52:05.980 --> 01:52:10.220
years whatever so to suddenly be there on someone else's charity felt very

01:52:10.220 --> 01:52:13.500
strange but that's how monks and nuns live right and that's what you're

01:52:13.500 --> 01:52:18.780
engaging in you're engaging in the very simple life and you're not allowed to

01:52:18.780 --> 01:52:22.260
talk to anybody you can't look at anybody in the eye everything's kind of

01:52:22.260 --> 01:52:26.660
set up as like a self-service situation and the men and women are completely

01:52:26.780 --> 01:52:30.580
separated so that you're not distractions to each other and then the

01:52:30.580 --> 01:52:34.420
primary thing you're doing is that you're meditating pretty much for most of

01:52:34.420 --> 01:52:38.340
the day it's like 10 hours of meditation a day and you learn a specific

01:52:38.340 --> 01:52:43.060
meditation technique so even though you're not allowed to talk to anybody

01:52:43.060 --> 01:52:48.060
they do have a discourse where the teacher teaches you about the system of

01:52:48.060 --> 01:52:52.260
meditation and why it's important so you're kind of learning the tenets of

01:52:53.020 --> 01:52:58.500
dhamma and it's a non-religious completely you know completely sort of

01:52:58.500 --> 01:53:05.340
secular universal ideas that they talk about and they all they talk about the

01:53:05.340 --> 01:53:12.420
the kind of what is what is the cause of everyone's misery and you know this is

01:53:12.420 --> 01:53:16.180
something Buddhists talk about all the time which is attachment but specifically

01:53:16.180 --> 01:53:20.500
what they talk about is this we're caught in the cycle of craving and a

01:53:20.500 --> 01:53:25.100
versions and this was something that was really important for me because I am

01:53:25.100 --> 01:53:33.060
actually prone to this massive iPhone addiction I mean it was bad and that was

01:53:33.060 --> 01:53:36.180
something I realized that every time through this practice every time I was

01:53:36.180 --> 01:53:41.420
you know writing a video for my for my channel and I would run into something

01:53:41.420 --> 01:53:45.060
difficult some difficult part I didn't know what to write as the next sentence

01:53:45.380 --> 01:53:51.020
immediately pick up the phone right it's because I had an aversion felt terrible

01:53:51.020 --> 01:53:56.100
had a craving to stop the aversion pick up the phone phone is a distraction you

01:53:56.100 --> 01:53:59.580
know and that's sort of how I've been living my life for some time now of

01:53:59.580 --> 01:54:04.380
just using my phone as a distraction and what's amazing about Vipassana is that

01:54:04.380 --> 01:54:09.660
you have nowhere to run you are meditating you're going inward you don't

01:54:09.660 --> 01:54:13.180
have anyone to talk to you you don't have any distractions of modern life like

01:54:13.220 --> 01:54:16.540
your phone like your computer but you don't even have an occupation you don't

01:54:16.540 --> 01:54:21.180
even have a job to keep you mentally busy you just have to reconcile with

01:54:21.180 --> 01:54:29.180
yourself and that whole forced process of that you're just sitting with yourself

01:54:29.180 --> 01:54:35.100
is so interesting it's it's really difficult it's extremely difficult it

01:54:35.100 --> 01:54:39.980
was like way too much time to spend with myself but the learnings out of it are

01:54:40.020 --> 01:54:43.420
so incredible and then what you start to notice through the Vipassana practice of

01:54:43.420 --> 01:54:49.060
the specific type of meditation which I won't get into here but it actually

01:54:49.060 --> 01:54:53.460
starts getting all of your all those things that you've been running from it

01:54:53.460 --> 01:54:58.220
allows it to come out it allows it to surface and it'll surface these are as

01:54:58.220 --> 01:55:04.660
a thought or as a sensation on your body or emotion and they warn they warn you

01:55:04.660 --> 01:55:09.100
that specific days tend to be really difficult for people and fifth day was

01:55:09.100 --> 01:55:12.300
the first day that I noticed that a lot of people were crying around me and I

01:55:12.300 --> 01:55:16.860
was very emotional it's like stuff just it's just there's been enough time that

01:55:16.860 --> 01:55:19.860
you've been sitting in silence that stuff starts to really come out and that's

01:55:19.860 --> 01:55:25.460
what the whole practice is really about is just try to recognize the misery cycle

01:55:25.460 --> 01:55:29.300
that people tend to keep themselves in and how to release themselves from it

01:55:29.300 --> 01:55:35.620
and it was the most transformative experience of my life it's something you

01:55:35.660 --> 01:55:39.780
know I know you're curious about it I would highly highly recommend but that's

01:55:39.780 --> 01:55:43.740
also why I wanted to bring it up here in case this is something that is

01:55:43.740 --> 01:55:48.100
interesting to other people they should definitely check it out because I think

01:55:48.100 --> 01:55:53.580
it's a very easy we live in a world where we can get every one of our sort of

01:55:53.580 --> 01:55:57.140
immediate needs met sort of what you've you've been talking about this you know

01:55:57.140 --> 01:56:01.860
the sketch you were talking about so it's a very hard to meet our it's very

01:56:01.900 --> 01:56:07.340
easy to meet our basic needs it's our spiritual needs that go completely

01:56:07.340 --> 01:56:13.740
ignored and this was a great opportunity to sort of reset my priorities like one

01:56:13.740 --> 01:56:19.140
of the things I noticed is that I I love my family I love my husband I love my

01:56:19.140 --> 01:56:24.900
friends and mentally I was deprioritizing them over my phone that like

01:56:24.900 --> 01:56:28.300
there was a part of me that was irritated if someone was talking to me

01:56:28.300 --> 01:56:31.140
because that meant I wasn't on my phone I mean that's how bad my addiction was

01:56:31.220 --> 01:56:37.260
I mean it's really embarrassing to even say it but this thing completely helped me

01:56:37.260 --> 01:56:44.220
see that and I felt that ache that that's what I was doing in my life and and so

01:56:44.220 --> 01:56:47.620
it helps you sort of reset a lot of things actually understand what your real

01:56:47.620 --> 01:56:56.660
priorities are that sounds amazing wow so that was 10 days 10 days how did it

01:56:56.700 --> 01:57:03.100
seem like 10 days or did it seem longer seem longer definitely seem longer and I

01:57:03.100 --> 01:57:08.180
think the first couple of days like past classially slow because the meditation

01:57:08.180 --> 01:57:11.700
periods you know are really long and then it changes your perception of time

01:57:11.700 --> 01:57:16.380
you know suddenly sitting because you meditate for one hour at a time just

01:57:16.380 --> 01:57:22.700
just about and that first couple of sessions felt so long and then slowly

01:57:22.700 --> 01:57:26.100
you're like oh one hour meditation doesn't sound that bad you know any more

01:57:26.740 --> 01:57:30.660
and and now we keep up the practice you have to you know if you want to continue

01:57:30.660 --> 01:57:34.900
to engage with it it's up to you but you you keep up a daily practice of it as

01:57:34.900 --> 01:57:39.580
well but yeah I did feel it incredibly long and then especially at the end

01:57:39.580 --> 01:57:43.420
because one of the things I just really struggled with was just missing company

01:57:43.420 --> 01:57:49.020
it's like I'm really lonely and so I got to I think by day nine I just started

01:57:49.020 --> 01:57:55.140
started to really like come on we're almost there almost there wow so have

01:57:55.180 --> 01:58:00.340
you had enough time to process the experience like have you changed yes I

01:58:00.340 --> 01:58:06.380
have I think I think there were a lot of ideas if you go let's say I think what

01:58:06.380 --> 01:58:09.980
you might find is that there are a lot of ideas that aren't really new to you

01:58:09.980 --> 01:58:13.220
you've been circling around them you know in your in your intellectual

01:58:13.220 --> 01:58:17.460
endeavors just like as you know that's how I felt because I think they're all

01:58:17.460 --> 01:58:23.060
ideas that that makes sense on a universal level whether it's Thomas's I'm

01:58:23.060 --> 01:58:26.020
telling you about it or Jordan Peterson talking about it or Carl Jung talking

01:58:26.020 --> 01:58:30.140
about it there are a lot of similarities in the in that understanding but there

01:58:30.140 --> 01:58:33.820
was one final piece that felt like it was missing where I was like circling

01:58:33.820 --> 01:58:42.460
around the ideas but that didn't mean that it had internalized quite so as

01:58:42.460 --> 01:58:47.060
part of this this philosophy you know the teachings of Dhamma one of the things

01:58:47.060 --> 01:58:50.740
he talks about is that there are three types of the main teacher his name is

01:58:50.780 --> 01:58:55.820
Goenka who has passed on now but there are recordings of him where he he he just

01:58:55.820 --> 01:59:01.220
gives the lesson and one of the things he talks about is that there are three

01:59:01.220 --> 01:59:07.780
different types of wisdom one is you hear someone else give you a piece of

01:59:07.780 --> 01:59:12.420
wisdom another is that you yourself understand it where you can intellectually

01:59:12.420 --> 01:59:17.420
and completely understand it and relate it to other people but then there's a

01:59:17.420 --> 01:59:23.140
third piece of wisdom where you feel it and he gave the example of of medicine

01:59:23.140 --> 01:59:27.540
that if a doctor tells you oh you're sick you need to take this medicine and you

01:59:27.540 --> 01:59:31.540
say oh that's great doctor thank you for this medicine that's you

01:59:31.540 --> 01:59:35.540
recognizing this other person giving you this piece of wisdom you can go and

01:59:35.540 --> 01:59:40.380
possess the medicine that's you understanding it you go went to the

01:59:40.380 --> 01:59:46.300
pharmacy and filled up your prescription but until you take it it's not going to

01:59:46.300 --> 01:59:51.660
help you and that was the piece that I felt was missing where I you know one

01:59:51.660 --> 01:59:54.980
of the things that's due to the difficulties of the last couple of

01:59:54.980 --> 02:00:00.940
years my it's it's really taken a toll on my body so for what you know for about

02:00:00.940 --> 02:00:06.300
a year ago I just came out of this period where I had a lot had like massive

02:00:06.300 --> 02:00:11.860
hair fall like massive hair fall and I also developed a chronic health issue in

02:00:11.860 --> 02:00:17.020
that in that period so it was like I understood the ideas that people were

02:00:17.020 --> 02:00:23.260
telling me intellectually but I hadn't quite internalized it where it wasn't

02:00:23.260 --> 02:00:28.060
being all these issues and miseries of my life were still being stored in my

02:00:28.060 --> 02:00:31.980
body and we're still taking a toll on me mentally and physically and

02:00:31.980 --> 02:00:39.820
spiritually and this this going to this helped take me to that finish line

02:00:39.860 --> 02:00:44.140
where I'm not saying I'm fixed or anything like that but at least

02:00:44.140 --> 02:00:48.700
understanding the principle of how to help myself and how to engage with

02:00:48.700 --> 02:00:56.460
with with with my issues that was that was extremely extremely necessary that's

02:00:56.460 --> 02:01:04.740
incredible it sounds like an experience I could benefit greatly from I'm you're

02:01:04.740 --> 02:01:11.420
not gonna change too much though right I might become too zen and just float

02:01:11.420 --> 02:01:16.060
out of here do you think this is gonna inform your future content are you

02:01:16.060 --> 02:01:20.420
gonna take it in a different direction yes I think so I think you know one of

02:01:20.420 --> 02:01:25.020
the conversations you and I had had last time like I was telling you the you know

02:01:25.020 --> 02:01:38.300
you've inspired me to be less sort of a tacky about things and more more sort of

02:01:38.300 --> 02:01:43.220
create positive visions for things so I you know you had you had sort of told

02:01:43.220 --> 02:01:46.620
me about how you think about those things and that was something I was kind

02:01:46.620 --> 02:01:51.900
of mulling over in my mind and now I understood why that's so important for

02:01:51.940 --> 02:01:56.820
me to do that so I don't want to be sitting in just bashing things and it's

02:01:56.820 --> 02:02:00.860
okay I think to criticize stuff I don't I don't think there's anything wrong with

02:02:00.860 --> 02:02:04.460
that I think that's a necessary part of any dialogue but to be constantly

02:02:04.460 --> 02:02:08.140
dunking on something is not something that I want to engage with I think that

02:02:08.140 --> 02:02:14.140
that instead trying to spread as much positivity and love as possible is is

02:02:14.140 --> 02:02:20.660
really what what I kind of gleaned from from this experience that's amazing I

02:02:20.660 --> 02:02:26.780
think for the last couple years the level of cynicism has been increasing but I

02:02:26.780 --> 02:02:31.940
feel like it it might get to a breaking point where people are gonna get keen to

02:02:31.940 --> 02:02:37.140
it and say I'm done with this cynicism because even even in our area we're like

02:02:37.140 --> 02:02:42.460
critical drinker he'll make a video about how horrible a movie is and that will

02:02:42.460 --> 02:02:46.140
get three million views and then he'll say hey this movie is pretty good and

02:02:46.140 --> 02:02:50.140
that'll get like a couple hundred thousand views yeah and even myself like

02:02:50.140 --> 02:02:54.860
when I see he's like he says this movie really sucks I'm like oh this is gonna

02:02:54.860 --> 02:02:58.340
be a great review yeah let's hear a critical drinker just dunk on this movie

02:02:58.340 --> 02:03:03.700
yeah but same same that's fine I hope he keeps doing that yeah but because the

02:03:03.700 --> 02:03:08.300
movies do suck they need to get dunked on but yeah someone has to dunk on them

02:03:08.620 --> 02:03:15.100
and he does it so well yeah we need a positive image of the future we need a

02:03:15.100 --> 02:03:21.660
vision that we can that gets us out of bed in the morning and I was I just did a

02:03:21.660 --> 02:03:28.260
podcast about the pyramids in Egypt and one thing that's so special about them

02:03:28.260 --> 02:03:31.940
is they're so mysterious but when you see them you realize that possibilities

02:03:31.940 --> 02:03:36.980
are endless and you're looking at something that is impenetrable to time

02:03:37.740 --> 02:03:42.500
and for one moment you get a glimpse into this thing that is like eternal and

02:03:42.500 --> 02:03:47.300
it makes you feel like you're part of this thing that's eternal and that even

02:03:47.300 --> 02:03:52.100
though your physical body was gonna go away part of your essence can just like

02:03:52.100 --> 02:03:58.820
ripple on forever and when you it's easy when you're in this matrix world where

02:03:58.820 --> 02:04:02.500
everything's so temporary and the buildings are all concrete and glass and

02:04:02.620 --> 02:04:07.300
everything's put together so fast and carelessly you kind of feel like you're

02:04:07.300 --> 02:04:14.900
just a cognitive machine you're just disposable and yeah I feel like the

02:04:14.900 --> 02:04:20.340
importance of getting outside of the matrix into these situations like what

02:04:20.340 --> 02:04:24.540
you just did or seeing the pyramids or just anything that takes you out of

02:04:24.540 --> 02:04:30.100
your normal state of consciousness yeah maybe it's psychedelics who knows can

02:04:30.140 --> 02:04:36.340
show you can can let you touch a different state and see time in a

02:04:36.340 --> 02:04:41.700
different way see yourself in a different way and step outside yourself so yeah

02:04:41.700 --> 02:04:46.340
it's very important to to mix things up otherwise it's like roundhog day same

02:04:46.340 --> 02:04:51.980
thing every day yeah yeah and look you know especially true for SF is that

02:04:51.980 --> 02:04:56.220
it's very easy to distort your own reality and think that this is life this

02:04:56.220 --> 02:04:59.740
is everything that's happening the chaos that's happening on these city streets

02:05:00.380 --> 02:05:06.860
is life and suddenly I found myself in these beautiful woods and it's snowing

02:05:06.860 --> 02:05:12.700
and they're deer about and woodpeckers in the trees and they're you know ducks in

02:05:12.700 --> 02:05:17.820
the pond and I thought wow what you know I'm I'm so wrapped up in a one type of

02:05:17.820 --> 02:05:24.420
existence that I can't I can't even perceive anything else sometimes so it's

02:05:24.420 --> 02:05:29.700
good to just like you said just good to break out of it yeah well I don't think

02:05:29.700 --> 02:05:32.420
your phone addiction is that bad actually because when you were saying

02:05:32.420 --> 02:05:37.700
that I was like oh boy that's I do the same thing sometimes when somebody's

02:05:37.700 --> 02:05:41.260
talking to me while I've got my phone out I'm like alright just want to see

02:05:41.260 --> 02:05:48.820
this one more meme hold on yeah it can get bad yeah I mean it's you know it's

02:05:48.820 --> 02:05:54.020
it's it's designed to keep you hooked you know it's designed to keep you

02:05:54.020 --> 02:06:00.220
swiping forever yeah I mean I just got back from a trip and I had my my phone

02:06:00.220 --> 02:06:04.540
on airplane mode I didn't want to do the roaming and so I my mind was like okay

02:06:04.540 --> 02:06:08.380
you're gonna be back in Wi-Fi pretty soon you're getting closer to Wi-Fi and I

02:06:08.380 --> 02:06:12.300
felt like my mind I'm like can you just enjoy what you're doing now instead of

02:06:12.300 --> 02:06:16.820
worrying about when you're gonna get to that like I felt like a guy that was

02:06:16.820 --> 02:06:20.900
swimming through the ocean trying to get to an island there's Wi-Fi it was

02:06:21.060 --> 02:06:26.620
okay I that so okay so as part of the question I they have you you know hand in

02:06:26.620 --> 02:06:32.020
your phone you can either leave it in your car you leave it in a locker and I

02:06:32.020 --> 02:06:36.060
found myself not missing the phone at all because I'm on the phone even when

02:06:36.060 --> 02:06:41.180
I'm brushing my teeth I mean it's like I said it's bad nothing you're saying is

02:06:41.180 --> 02:06:47.700
that bad I'm glad you're validating that other people are also there doing

02:06:47.780 --> 02:06:53.420
doing this along with me so I'm not enabling you though no I have changed

02:06:53.420 --> 02:06:59.340
I'm now reformed hopefully it sticks is the question because you know it's like

02:06:59.340 --> 02:07:06.060
two weeks we're two weeks out of this so but I did not miss the phone but when

02:07:06.060 --> 02:07:11.460
it was time to get it again I reached for it in this dark locker it's just a

02:07:11.460 --> 02:07:16.660
single phone and it honestly felt like I was reaching for the ring from Lord the

02:07:16.660 --> 02:07:22.060
Rings you know in Gandalf we just down for it and I and it felt like hot in my

02:07:22.060 --> 02:07:25.900
hand and I went to sit down because I was eating breakfast with my friend she

02:07:25.900 --> 02:07:28.500
would she's the one who had convinced me so she was there finally we could talk

02:07:28.500 --> 02:07:36.500
and it was like I was talking to her but like my attention mentally was on that

02:07:36.500 --> 02:07:43.140
phone and and I thought wow it's so strange because then she got up she left

02:07:43.300 --> 02:07:49.180
and I turned it on and I saw like my usual you know notifications okay text from

02:07:49.180 --> 02:07:54.740
mom and dad like okay check my you know Instagram real quick check YouTube real

02:07:54.740 --> 02:08:01.100
quick cat check Twitter real quick and then I thought really like this is this

02:08:01.100 --> 02:08:06.420
is the thing yeah but like this is what all the consternation is about just for

02:08:06.420 --> 02:08:12.380
those like four or five in things of engagement that then you just cycle

02:08:12.380 --> 02:08:20.300
between all day for what you know and what satisfaction did that give you and

02:08:20.300 --> 02:08:24.980
that moment you got nothing out of that you got not a damn thing not as much as

02:08:24.980 --> 02:08:29.180
satisfaction as you had talking to your best friend over you know over breakfast

02:08:29.180 --> 02:08:34.820
a minute ago and so the whole ride home we had a long ride so I had a long time

02:08:34.820 --> 02:08:38.580
to think about it and I said okay it has to change like the relationship has to

02:08:38.580 --> 02:08:43.220
change like it has utility it is the must in modern life but you have to change

02:08:43.220 --> 02:08:48.540
that it should not be moving on your person at all times like again it's

02:08:48.540 --> 02:08:54.020
it's like the ring it's like the ring where when I'm walking around and I have

02:08:54.020 --> 02:08:58.380
my hand in my coat because it's SF so it's cold all the time my hand is around

02:08:58.380 --> 02:09:06.300
the phone you know like that like that level of engagement with it or what if

02:09:06.300 --> 02:09:09.780
I'm around the house it's in my back pocket if I'm at my desk it's sitting

02:09:09.780 --> 02:09:14.140
right here on the desk if I'm standing in the kitchen it's it's on the on the

02:09:14.140 --> 02:09:18.500
counter next to me if I'm in the bathroom it's in the bathroom with me if I'm in my

02:09:18.500 --> 02:09:23.660
bedroom it's on my side table why such an intense like it is it's like I'm

02:09:23.700 --> 02:09:29.900
attached to it and and so I said okay no it's gonna live in the kitchen 24 7 it's

02:09:29.900 --> 02:09:34.020
not gonna be here next to you if you need it you can get up use it in the

02:09:34.020 --> 02:09:38.500
kitchen then you can leave it there and come back and that has been the new

02:09:38.500 --> 02:09:41.700
system so it's not allowed in the bathroom it's not allowed in the bedroom

02:09:41.700 --> 02:09:48.220
nowhere it just lives in the kitchen and that has been really really good I

02:09:48.220 --> 02:09:53.620
keep trying to break it but I'm like nope don't forget you know I need to do it

02:09:53.620 --> 02:09:57.220
for 30 days and then it'll hopefully stick from there and I don't have to

02:09:57.220 --> 02:10:03.020
force it as much well that's yeah that's a great insight that you tapped into and

02:10:03.020 --> 02:10:08.540
you're inspiring me I should probably do the same thing I might need the 10-day

02:10:08.540 --> 02:10:14.580
retreat yeah like jolt me into it yeah it's ironic because we're both content

02:10:14.580 --> 02:10:18.260
creators or influencers or however you want to put it but it's like we make our

02:10:18.260 --> 02:10:22.300
career online mm-hmm and a lot of the things that we're spreading our awareness

02:10:22.340 --> 02:10:28.060
about your behavior which if you listen to us you might get offline so we're

02:10:28.060 --> 02:10:34.620
like wait don't don't don't listen to us too much yeah yeah I but I also think

02:10:34.620 --> 02:10:41.380
that you know when I was on the retreat a lot of the time I actually was thinking

02:10:41.380 --> 02:10:44.180
about when you know when you have breaks and stuff and you're not you're not

02:10:44.180 --> 02:10:49.120
like meditating I was thinking about a lot of movie scenes I was thinking about

02:10:49.160 --> 02:10:54.280
TV shows certain quotes that were sticking out to me and like even books

02:10:54.280 --> 02:10:58.560
certain books and I thought that's one thing I realized is that because of my

02:10:58.560 --> 02:11:03.200
phone addiction I actually deprioritize all the things that I genuinely love and

02:11:03.200 --> 02:11:09.480
I mentioned family and friends and my husband but I actually even even art like

02:11:09.480 --> 02:11:13.720
sitting and watching Lord of the Rings felt feels like oh it takes too much

02:11:13.720 --> 02:11:18.240
time out of the day but me being on the phone for four hours you know not

02:11:18.280 --> 02:11:22.640
cumulate are not all at once but cumulatively throughout the day yeah

02:11:22.640 --> 02:11:27.800
I'm probably on the phone for four four hours so that's okay doing something

02:11:27.800 --> 02:11:32.520
that brings you no joy but watching something really nice or even a you

02:11:32.520 --> 02:11:35.960
know a YouTube video that you like that you find informative interesting

02:11:35.960 --> 02:11:40.920
whatever versus just mindlessly scrolling and I think that was actually the

02:11:40.920 --> 02:11:45.680
big thing is that I'm still you know I'm still consuming things but it's stuff

02:11:45.840 --> 02:11:50.560
it's just being about more mindful and what impact it has on me I think that

02:11:50.560 --> 02:11:55.760
that was the shift is that engaging actually engaging with art on a day-to-day

02:11:55.760 --> 02:12:01.400
basis versus scrolling Twitter where I had I go through you know 15 different

02:12:01.400 --> 02:12:07.480
types of emotion in rapid succession in under a minute you know what does that

02:12:07.480 --> 02:12:11.800
really do for me I'm outraged at this and excited by that and I'm building to

02:12:11.800 --> 02:12:15.200
this and what does that do for me versus sitting and watching something that I

02:12:15.200 --> 02:12:21.240
actually really like or find find interesting one of my favorite quotes

02:12:21.240 --> 02:12:25.920
is from Terrence McKenna he says if you don't have a plan you become a part of

02:12:25.920 --> 02:12:31.200
somebody else's plan and I think about that quote all the time it's like nobody

02:12:31.200 --> 02:12:34.360
wakes up in the morning and says today I'm going to spend eight hours on my

02:12:34.360 --> 02:12:41.440
phone nobody does that right but once you slip into a subconscious state which

02:12:41.480 --> 02:12:47.880
we operate on 95% of the time your mind just reaches for those programs that are

02:12:47.880 --> 02:12:52.840
like deep grooves in your your mind yeah and like the more you do in action the

02:12:52.840 --> 02:12:57.160
deeper the groove is going to be in your mind it's like skiing down a mountain

02:12:57.160 --> 02:13:02.760
yeah and so you know it's it's like such a deep program like there's certain

02:13:02.760 --> 02:13:08.200
apps on my phone that I go to all the time and my my finger will automatically

02:13:08.200 --> 02:13:13.080
scroll and search for that if I move that yeah my thumb like wait where'd that

02:13:13.080 --> 02:13:18.160
go hmm do it subconsciously and then wait you know I'll do it without thinking

02:13:18.160 --> 02:13:22.360
yes like I used to go to Facebook so much that I would go on the computer and

02:13:22.360 --> 02:13:27.040
then my fingers would just type in FAC and I'm like I don't even want to go to

02:13:27.040 --> 02:13:31.640
Facebook right now why am I doing this or even that moment where I'll like close

02:13:31.640 --> 02:13:36.000
the app only to reopen it and not even realize like I just closed it and I

02:13:36.040 --> 02:13:41.800
reopened it and even the instinct that if if my phone is on my desk I will just

02:13:41.800 --> 02:13:47.120
instinctively instinctively reach for it and it is that that yeah like you're

02:13:47.120 --> 02:13:52.120
saying it has those groove marks right it's built in after years and years and

02:13:52.120 --> 02:13:58.080
that's why that what what you learn at the Bush now is that craving it's a

02:13:58.080 --> 02:14:03.000
craving and you have to meet it immediately and so you just leap to meet

02:14:03.000 --> 02:14:07.080
it immediately so having that creating that disconnection and recognizing it's

02:14:07.080 --> 02:14:13.320
that it's just it's that slight form of distance space between the craving craving

02:14:13.320 --> 02:14:17.400
coming up and you resolving it instead going oh look at that craving I have a

02:14:17.400 --> 02:14:21.120
craving to be on my phone right now why okay because I just reached something

02:14:21.120 --> 02:14:27.280
hard in in the script in the in my next video script that I don't know how to

02:14:27.280 --> 02:14:32.960
resolve and I feel inadequate I feel like maybe I'm not good enough for this

02:14:32.960 --> 02:14:36.400
maybe I'm not good enough for for what I'm trying to be maybe I'll never be

02:14:36.400 --> 02:14:41.240
good enough maybe I'll fail at this okay so you're afraid like you know so just

02:14:41.240 --> 02:14:47.200
taking it that's the weird thing about being a human being is that we're so

02:14:47.200 --> 02:14:53.040
fear-based we're so anxiety-based and we make these crazy leaps you know we

02:14:53.080 --> 02:14:58.560
make these crazy leaps of the small thing happens and it'll be like well

02:14:58.560 --> 02:15:02.920
maybe I'll die because of this you know what I mean it's like maybe

02:15:02.920 --> 02:15:08.440
psychologically I'm completely completely you know at risk because of

02:15:08.440 --> 02:15:13.560
this so it's very interesting then then we have these tools to then distract us

02:15:13.560 --> 02:15:18.360
in the moment and keep us away from that that but it exists somewhere it's

02:15:18.360 --> 02:15:24.000
always there so it's better to address it rather than let it just just let it

02:15:24.000 --> 02:15:30.520
hide from you oh yeah that's very inspiring you're I'm definitely gonna

02:15:30.520 --> 02:15:34.400
make some changes after this conversation thank you thank you for

02:15:34.400 --> 02:15:37.680
saying that and yes I think you'll find I think you'll find the ten day retreat

02:15:37.680 --> 02:15:43.440
really helpful in doing it if you know if yeah I'll send you I'll send you some

02:15:43.440 --> 02:15:47.760
stuff about it after yeah I'd love to check it out clearly becoming a bit

02:15:47.960 --> 02:15:54.680
pushy well I like it that it's not it's not led by a guru or something right

02:15:54.680 --> 02:15:59.560
it's kind of just your own experience yeah and they're very anti-ego it's a

02:15:59.560 --> 02:16:06.080
very anti-ego like anytime there's a group that's led by one individual who's

02:16:06.080 --> 02:16:10.200
got like all the answers I'm always like I'm not really into cults you know like

02:16:10.200 --> 02:16:15.000
that's not my thing yeah but this sounds like a very personal journey which

02:16:15.160 --> 02:16:18.960
I've always been drawn towards those experiences like sensory deprivation

02:16:18.960 --> 02:16:24.960
tank or psychedelic journey or something like that yeah those have kind of sparked

02:16:24.960 --> 02:16:28.680
my interest more because it's like I don't know you're just grappling with

02:16:28.680 --> 02:16:34.480
your own inner journey hmm exactly I think this you know micro dosing around

02:16:34.480 --> 02:16:40.360
psychedelics is is fascinating it's really really interesting yeah it's

02:16:40.360 --> 02:16:44.400
something I've covered a lot of my channel yeah but it's definitely not the

02:16:44.520 --> 02:16:49.680
all-end-all cure like people are going crazy with it now yeah it's that I like

02:16:49.680 --> 02:16:52.760
by the way I like how you think in quotes because I feel like I think in

02:16:52.760 --> 02:16:57.720
scenes and like movie scenes I think you think in quotes and you come up with the

02:16:57.720 --> 02:17:02.840
best ones they like the exact right quotes but there's that that that one I

02:17:02.840 --> 02:17:07.800
think it's a Carl Jung quote that don't be careful of unearned wisdom am I am I

02:17:07.800 --> 02:17:13.480
right about that I'll have to look into that one that's a good one be careful of

02:17:13.480 --> 02:17:17.000
unearned wisdom yeah and I think it relates to this is that you know

02:17:17.000 --> 02:17:22.240
psychedelics is if people think that it's an easy route to wisdom but it's

02:17:22.240 --> 02:17:26.280
really it's really not it's yeah it's it's more about building on what you're

02:17:26.280 --> 02:17:32.000
already doing like aiding that rather than suddenly catapulting you into

02:17:32.000 --> 02:17:39.640
massive realizations 100% well this has been an amazing conversation thank you

02:17:39.640 --> 02:17:44.200
