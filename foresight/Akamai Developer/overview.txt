1. **Tailing a Log File**: You can monitor a log file in real-time by using the `tail` command followed by the filename of the log file (e.g., `tail -f /var/log/syslog`). Press `Enter` to start and `Ctrl+C` to exit.

2. **Truncating a File**: To clear the contents of a file without removing the file itself, you can use the `truncate` command with the `-s` option to set the size to zero (e.g., `sudo truncate -s 0 /path/to/your/file.txt`). This is useful for log files that you want to reset without stopping services that rely on them.

3. **Formatting Command Output with `column`**: The `column` command can be used to format the output of any command (like `mount`) into a more readable columnar format. Use `column -t` to create a tab-delimited table from the command output (e.g., `mount | column -t`).

Remember to use these commands with caution, especially `truncate`, as it can permanently remove data if used incorrectly. Always ensure you have backups when manipulating critical files like log files.
