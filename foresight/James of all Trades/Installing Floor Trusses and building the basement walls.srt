3
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:23,120
the trusses set today we got a few of them up there we're getting ready to

4
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:28,920
start marking them out this interest here the anchor bolts are touching it so

5
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:32,040
we're gonna have to notch it out where all the anchor bolts are about one inch

6
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:36,200
or so on the bottom plate so we just got that marked we're gonna pull it back

7
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:43,880
down and get those notched out and we're gonna start laying it out

8
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:22,400
did you fart? did you fart when you lifted that?

9
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:39,600
did you squeeze one out of me again? all right I'll push it your way. yeah come on

10
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:58,200
all right so we got the end one on one two three four five so six trusses all

11
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:03,800
together and we got six to fill in this gap right here

12
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:19,440
sorry I fell on the ditch

13
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:30,200
all right

14
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:56,100
all right well we got one two three four six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve

15
00:02:56,100 --> 00:03:02,100
Is that right? 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, yeah we got 12 of them in so far.

16
00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:46,100
Just go on in there. I'm trying. Sometimes I feel like you're trying to push me.

17
00:03:56,100 --> 00:03:59,100
Oh man.

18
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:29,100
Okay.

19
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:46,100
Let's just set it down in the ground and we'll get these two set and then come back up here.

20
00:04:56,100 --> 00:05:03,100
Lay it over.

21
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:46,100
Yeah, we got all the long trusses in here.

22
00:05:46,100 --> 00:05:54,100
Yeah, it's just a matter of getting them all screwed down and lined up like they're supposed to be.

23
00:05:54,100 --> 00:06:16,100
Get started on that.

24
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:26,100
Come on down. Yeah, remember we pulled all of our 16s starting here and going that way so when we do our decking and everything we do is going to be from this side that way.

25
00:07:16,100 --> 00:07:44,100
Yeah.

26
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:49,100
That's what I found. That's what I found.

27
00:07:49,100 --> 00:07:55,100
You want it? Yeah. It's yours. Keep it.

28
00:07:55,100 --> 00:08:00,100
You find a rock Samuel? Yeah. I found a marble.

29
00:08:00,100 --> 00:08:02,100
Whoa.

30
00:08:02,100 --> 00:08:05,100
Dude, I found that rock.

31
00:08:05,100 --> 00:08:09,100
What is it? A rock? Yeah, I'm good.

32
00:08:09,100 --> 00:08:16,100
I found that rock.

33
00:08:16,100 --> 00:08:18,100
I'm hot out here.

34
00:08:18,100 --> 00:08:27,100
You look like you're holding a cigarette.

35
00:08:27,100 --> 00:08:30,100
Be careful. Don't let that get sucked in your lungs, okay?

36
00:08:30,100 --> 00:08:33,100
Or in your throat.

37
00:08:33,100 --> 00:08:38,100
Well, you got that right there.

38
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:42,100
Okay, say you're like tripping and you fall, okay?

39
00:08:42,100 --> 00:08:47,100
Then what happens with the nail goes right down your gullet, okay?

40
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:54,100
Sweet, you're so concerned.

41
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:27,100
Okay.

42
00:09:47,100 --> 00:10:07,100
Man, what a day.

43
00:10:07,100 --> 00:10:12,100
We've been out here for 10 hours. You got here 7am, it's 5am right now.

44
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:14,100
We went ahead and cleaned up.

45
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:18,100
Didn't really go home and shower and eat and all that good stuff.

46
00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:22,100
We got all the long trusses in today.

47
00:10:22,100 --> 00:10:24,100
They are all in, lined up.

48
00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:27,100
He's got the rim board run around.

49
00:10:27,100 --> 00:10:30,100
I don't know if it's a rim board, but it's got that 2x4 run around.

50
00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:31,100
Line them all up.

51
00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:38,100
I put stiffeners down through the center in between these two big spans.

52
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:43,100
I'll be doing more over here after we get these center trusses in.

53
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:52,100
We got the bedroom or the man cave root walls all built.

54
00:10:52,100 --> 00:10:54,100
We got the divider wall.

55
00:10:54,100 --> 00:10:55,100
This is actually the other side of this.

56
00:10:55,100 --> 00:10:58,100
This is going to be the staircase.

57
00:10:58,100 --> 00:11:02,100
Tomorrow we'll build the rest of these walls.

58
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:03,100
They'll be the wall.

59
00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:06,100
This will be the bathroom in here.

60
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:15,100
You'll come in that door and there'll be a pantry and a washer, dryer, hot water heater in here.

61
00:11:15,100 --> 00:11:18,100
We got to get these walls built.

62
00:11:18,100 --> 00:11:25,100
We got to get an LVL beam for right here to hang these trusses from.

63
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:32,100
That whole big opening is going to be the staircase with a place for the fireplace.

64
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:37,100
Looks pretty good.

65
00:11:37,100 --> 00:11:42,100
Let's go look up top.

66
00:11:42,100 --> 00:11:50,100
These basement walls aren't square, so I had to line it up with this back wall as the straightest wall.

67
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:55,100
We got one spot right there where the 2x4 isn't sucked up about 10 foot down.

68
00:11:55,100 --> 00:12:00,100
We're going to unscrew that, take it back out, and get it cinched up tighter than that.

69
00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:07,100
That's perfectly straight.

70
00:12:07,100 --> 00:12:17,100
Amazing what a couple of guys can do in 10 hours by themselves.

71
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:20,100
I think it looks good.

72
00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:35,100
This is the north side.

73
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:38,100
What do you think?

74
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:44,100
We'll be back tomorrow, huh?

75
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:48,100
Today we're going to be finishing up, hopefully get it all finished.

76
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:54,100
I've got 1, 2, 3, 4 more walls to build here.

77
00:12:54,100 --> 00:13:05,100
Then I can get them all straightened and lined up and put these short trusses in through here.

78
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:21,100
We're going to have to get all the trusses straightened and lined up.

79
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:28,100
We're going to have to get all the trusses straightened and lined up.

80
00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:34,100
We're going to have to get all the trusses straightened and lined up.

81
00:13:34,100 --> 00:13:39,100
We're going to have to get all the trusses straightened and lined up.

82
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:46,100
We're going to have to get all the trusses straightened and lined up.

83
00:13:46,100 --> 00:13:52,100
We're going to have to get all the trusses straightened and lined up.

84
00:13:52,100 --> 00:13:57,100
We're going to have to get all the trusses straightened and lined up.

85
00:13:57,100 --> 00:14:04,100
We're going to have to get all the trusses straightened and lined up.

86
00:14:04,100 --> 00:14:09,100
We're going to have to get all the trusses straightened and lined up.

87
00:14:09,100 --> 00:14:14,100
We're going to have to get all the trusses straightened and lined up.

88
00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:19,100
We're going to have to get all the trusses straightened and lined up.

89
00:14:19,100 --> 00:14:24,100
We're going to have to get all the trusses straightened and lined up.

90
00:14:24,100 --> 00:14:29,100
We're going to have to get all the trusses straightened and lined up.

91
00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:38,100
All right.

92
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:41,100
Is it June 5th today?

93
00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:43,100
Right.

94
00:14:43,100 --> 00:14:54,100
We got all the trusses except for five in, and we need to get a LVL beam to go across this opening right here before we can put those in.

95
00:14:54,100 --> 00:15:00,100
We've got all the walls laid out and partially built.

96
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:04,100
This will be studs through here for the staircase that's going to go up.

97
00:15:04,100 --> 00:15:08,100
This will be a door and you get two by 12 for the headers.

98
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:13,100
This is a load bearing wall.

99
00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:15,100
It'll be a two foot eight door.

100
00:15:15,100 --> 00:15:18,100
It should be big enough for washers and dryers to get through.

101
00:15:18,100 --> 00:15:20,100
Here's the bathroom walls.

102
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:22,100
Two foot eight door.

103
00:15:22,100 --> 00:15:25,100
Going to open to the right.

104
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:32,100
It'll be a tub right there, a toilet, and a sink.

105
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:37,100
Looking pretty good.

106
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:39,100
Got all the runners in it.

107
00:15:39,100 --> 00:15:41,100
There's stiff backs.

108
00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:49,100
Austin's just going around and putting, I don't know, a couple hundred and eight thousand screws in.

109
00:15:50,100 --> 00:15:53,100
How many screws are you putting in each of those?

110
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:55,100
Six.

111
00:15:55,100 --> 00:15:57,100
Six times what, 30 trusses?

112
00:15:57,100 --> 00:15:58,100
Yeah.

113
00:15:58,100 --> 00:16:03,100
Times two because you got to do it on both ends.

114
00:16:03,100 --> 00:16:06,100
So technically eight to count the...

115
00:16:06,100 --> 00:16:08,100
You put two out on the nose of it too.

116
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:14,100
So eight times three is what, that's 240 screws per size.

117
00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:21,100
480 screws just on the ends of the trusses.

118
00:16:21,100 --> 00:16:26,100
I'm not counting all the stiff backs and stuff too that we already put in.

119
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:32,100
Time to go home, take a little break, get ready for work this week.

120
00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:35,100
We'll get back out here next weekend, finish it up.

121
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:38,100
Hopefully we start laying decking next weekend.
