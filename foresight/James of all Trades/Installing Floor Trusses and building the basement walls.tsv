278100	286100	Let's just set it down in the ground and we'll get these two set and then come back up here.
296100	303100	Lay it over.
326100	346100	Yeah, we got all the long trusses in here.
346100	354100	Yeah, it's just a matter of getting them all screwed down and lined up like they're supposed to be.
354100	376100	Get started on that.
376100	386100	Come on down. Yeah, remember we pulled all of our 16s starting here and going that way so when we do our decking and everything we do is going to be from this side that way.
436100	464100	Yeah.
464100	469100	That's what I found. That's what I found.
469100	475100	You want it? Yeah. It's yours. Keep it.
475100	480100	You find a rock Samuel? Yeah. I found a marble.
480100	482100	Whoa.
482100	485100	Dude, I found that rock.
485100	489100	What is it? A rock? Yeah, I'm good.
489100	496100	I found that rock.
496100	498100	I'm hot out here.
498100	507100	You look like you're holding a cigarette.
507100	510100	Be careful. Don't let that get sucked in your lungs, okay?
510100	513100	Or in your throat.
513100	518100	Well, you got that right there.
518100	522100	Okay, say you're like tripping and you fall, okay?
522100	527100	Then what happens with the nail goes right down your gullet, okay?
527100	534100	Sweet, you're so concerned.
557100	567100	Okay.
587100	607100	Man, what a day.
607100	612100	We've been out here for 10 hours. You got here 7am, it's 5am right now.
612100	614100	We went ahead and cleaned up.
614100	618100	Didn't really go home and shower and eat and all that good stuff.
618100	622100	We got all the long trusses in today.
622100	624100	They are all in, lined up.
624100	627100	He's got the rim board run around.
627100	630100	I don't know if it's a rim board, but it's got that 2x4 run around.
630100	631100	Line them all up.
631100	638100	I put stiffeners down through the center in between these two big spans.
638100	643100	I'll be doing more over here after we get these center trusses in.
643100	652100	We got the bedroom or the man cave root walls all built.
652100	654100	We got the divider wall.
654100	655100	This is actually the other side of this.
655100	658100	This is going to be the staircase.
658100	662100	Tomorrow we'll build the rest of these walls.
662100	663100	They'll be the wall.
663100	666100	This will be the bathroom in here.
666100	675100	You'll come in that door and there'll be a pantry and a washer, dryer, hot water heater in here.
675100	678100	We got to get these walls built.
678100	685100	We got to get an LVL beam for right here to hang these trusses from.
685100	692100	That whole big opening is going to be the staircase with a place for the fireplace.
692100	697100	Looks pretty good.
697100	702100	Let's go look up top.
702100	710100	These basement walls aren't square, so I had to line it up with this back wall as the straightest wall.
710100	715100	We got one spot right there where the 2x4 isn't sucked up about 10 foot down.
715100	720100	We're going to unscrew that, take it back out, and get it cinched up tighter than that.
720100	727100	That's perfectly straight.
727100	737100	Amazing what a couple of guys can do in 10 hours by themselves.
737100	740100	I think it looks good.
740100	755100	This is the north side.
755100	758100	What do you think?
758100	764100	We'll be back tomorrow, huh?
764100	768100	Today we're going to be finishing up, hopefully get it all finished.
768100	774100	I've got 1, 2, 3, 4 more walls to build here.
774100	785100	Then I can get them all straightened and lined up and put these short trusses in through here.
794100	801100	We're going to have to get all the trusses straightened and lined up.
801100	808100	We're going to have to get all the trusses straightened and lined up.

864100	869100	We're going to have to get all the trusses straightened and lined up.
869100	878100	All right.
878100	881100	Is it June 5th today?
881100	883100	Right.
883100	894100	We got all the trusses except for five in, and we need to get a LVL beam to go across this opening right here before we can put those in.
894100	900100	We've got all the walls laid out and partially built.
900100	904100	This will be studs through here for the staircase that's going to go up.
904100	908100	This will be a door and you get two by 12 for the headers.
908100	913100	This is a load bearing wall.
913100	915100	It'll be a two foot eight door.
915100	918100	It should be big enough for washers and dryers to get through.
918100	920100	Here's the bathroom walls.
920100	922100	Two foot eight door.
922100	925100	Going to open to the right.
925100	932100	It'll be a tub right there, a toilet, and a sink.
932100	937100	Looking pretty good.
937100	939100	Got all the runners in it.
939100	941100	There's stiff backs.
941100	949100	Austin's just going around and putting, I don't know, a couple hundred and eight thousand screws in.
950100	953100	How many screws are you putting in each of those?
953100	955100	Six.
955100	957100	Six times what, 30 trusses?
957100	958100	Yeah.
958100	963100	Times two because you got to do it on both ends.
963100	966100	So technically eight to count the...
966100	968100	You put two out on the nose of it too.
968100	974100	So eight times three is what, that's 240 screws per size.
974100	981100	480 screws just on the ends of the trusses.
981100	986100	I'm not counting all the stiff backs and stuff too that we already put in.
986100	992100	Time to go home, take a little break, get ready for work this week.
992100	995100	We'll get back out here next weekend, finish it up.
995100	998100	Hopefully we start laying decking next weekend.
