Checking James of all Trades/Installing Floor Trusses and building the basement walls.txt
 On June 4th, Austin and an assistant have been working on constructing a building, which includes setting trusses, notching the bottom plate for anchor bolts, and marking out positions for the trusses. They've already installed six of the twelve planned trusses and are preparing to continue this work by installing more trusses and fixing them in place with screws. The team also took a moment to find a marble and discuss safety precautions against inhaling dust or foreign objects while working.

They encountered an issue where one of the 2x4s was not perfectly straight when embedded deep underground, so they plan to unscrew and re-insert it to ensure everything is aligned correctly. The structure's layout includes a man cave or bedroom, a staircase, a bathroom, a pantry, a space for a washer, dryer, and hot water heater, and potential living quarters above.

The team has outlined the remaining walls that need to be built and are nearly complete with the truss installation. They've also installed stiff backs and numerous screws to secure the trusses in place. Austin calculated that they've already used 240 screws per side, totaling 480 screws for the ends of the trusses alone.

The plan is to take a break, prepare for the week ahead, and return to the project the following weekend to complete the truss installation. The next step after that is to lay the decking. The work completed so far demonstrates the hard work and dedication of Austin and his assistant in progressing with the construction.
