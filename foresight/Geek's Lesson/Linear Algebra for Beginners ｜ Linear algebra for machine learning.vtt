00:00.000 --> 00:06.000
Let's start by asking the most basic question, what is a vector?

00:06.000 --> 00:12.000
And a vector is really just two pieces of information.

00:12.000 --> 00:19.000
Direction and length, or what's also called magnitude.

00:19.000 --> 00:24.000
Two different words for the same thing.

00:24.000 --> 00:30.000
Now length is a very physical visual concept, right?

00:30.000 --> 00:33.000
It's something we can see, it's something we can measure.

00:33.000 --> 00:40.000
And the same with direction, it's our orientation, it's a very visual thing.

00:40.000 --> 00:46.000
So vectors to begin with most intuitively fit on a graph.

00:46.000 --> 00:51.000
They fit in a place where we can visualize them.

00:51.000 --> 00:58.000
And so how could we attempt to capture direction and length?

00:58.000 --> 01:04.000
Well you know, I think an arrow does a pretty good job.

01:04.000 --> 01:09.000
This for instance, for instance, captures direction, it's moving in the northeast direction,

01:09.000 --> 01:14.000
and it also clearly has a certain length.

01:14.000 --> 01:19.000
And so this is a vector, and that's exactly how we graph vectors.

01:19.000 --> 01:23.000
Just as arrows.

01:23.000 --> 01:31.000
This is also a vector, it's pointing in a certain direction, it has a certain length, as is this.

01:31.000 --> 01:35.000
So is this, this is a vector.

01:35.000 --> 01:39.000
Even though it doesn't start at the origin, it's clearly pointing in a certain direction,

01:39.000 --> 01:43.000
so it has direction, and it clearly also has length.

01:43.000 --> 01:48.000
So vectors need not start at the origin, they can start anywhere.

01:48.000 --> 01:55.000
This is also a vector, it's pointing in a certain direction, and it has a certain length.

01:55.000 --> 01:58.000
Okay, that's great.

01:58.000 --> 02:03.000
Now let's look at a specific example.

02:03.000 --> 02:10.000
Here is a vector, and I want to first of all name that vector.

02:10.000 --> 02:16.000
So I'm just going to call it V, and I'm going to put a little arrow over the top of it,

02:16.000 --> 02:20.000
to make sure that we know that this is a vector.

02:20.000 --> 02:30.000
So the vector V, and now I want to capture this information.

02:30.000 --> 02:37.000
I want to capture the information that arrow is telling us, without needing to draw it.

02:37.000 --> 02:44.000
So I'm not going to write this like this, I'm not going to say V is equal to this arrow, that's too ambiguous.

02:44.000 --> 02:52.000
I need something more definite, something with more structure.

02:52.000 --> 02:59.000
Well, this vector moves over a certain amount in the x direction.

02:59.000 --> 03:04.000
Let's say for example, it moves over 3 in the x direction.

03:04.000 --> 03:11.000
It also moves a certain amount up in the y direction.

03:11.000 --> 03:16.000
Let's say for example, it moves up 1.

03:16.000 --> 03:22.000
Well now I can say that this vector is equal to its components.

03:22.000 --> 03:25.000
So that's a new word for us.

03:25.000 --> 03:40.000
It's equal to its x component, which is 3, how much it moves over in x, and its y component, which is 1, which is how much it moves up in y.

03:40.000 --> 03:58.000
So again, this is the x component and the y component.

03:58.000 --> 04:06.000
And now anyone in the world looking at this vector, V equal to 3, 1, can go ahead and draw that vector if they want to.

04:06.000 --> 04:13.000
They know exactly which vector we're talking about when we write that.

04:13.000 --> 04:24.000
Just a bit of notation here, this is also written as a column.

04:24.000 --> 04:28.000
And it's the exact same information, it's just vertical now.

04:28.000 --> 04:37.000
And again, this is still the x component and still the y component.

04:37.000 --> 04:39.000
Okay, let's look at another example.

04:39.000 --> 04:47.000
Let's look at, let's say the vector u.

04:47.000 --> 04:58.000
And let's say it has the components negative 2, 3.

04:58.000 --> 05:03.000
Well that simply means we're moving over negative 2 in x and up 3 in y.

05:03.000 --> 05:08.000
So maybe something right around here.

05:08.000 --> 05:13.000
So this would be 3 in y and negative 2 in the x direction.

05:13.000 --> 05:21.000
And there's our vector.

05:21.000 --> 05:24.000
Nothing to it.

05:24.000 --> 05:40.000
And of course we could have written this as a column vector, negative 2, 3, if we wanted to.

05:40.000 --> 05:46.000
Okay, so we have that down.

05:46.000 --> 05:54.000
But what about direction and length?

05:54.000 --> 05:57.000
Does this capture direction and length?

05:57.000 --> 06:04.000
These just have, just using two components, how does that tell us direction and length?

06:04.000 --> 06:10.000
Well it tells us direction because this is the vector that moves over 3 in x and up 1 in y.

06:10.000 --> 06:13.000
That's its direction, over 3 up 1.

06:13.000 --> 06:15.000
It points in that direction.

06:15.000 --> 06:18.000
But what about length?

06:18.000 --> 06:21.000
Well that's what we're going to talk about in the next video.

06:21.000 --> 06:25.000
But I'll give you a clue.

06:25.000 --> 06:30.000
We've formed a right triangle here.

06:30.000 --> 06:37.000
The components tell us the length of the base and the length of the height of the triangle.

06:37.000 --> 06:42.000
And what we're trying to find is this length here which is the hypotenuse of the right triangle.

06:42.000 --> 06:49.000
So maybe you know some formula or theorem that tells you how to find the length of the hypotenuse of a right triangle.

06:49.000 --> 06:54.000
And if you do then you can figure out the length of this vector.

06:54.000 --> 06:59.000
And that's what we're going to do in the next video. See you then.

06:59.000 --> 07:04.000
Let's find the length of v equal to 3 1.

07:04.000 --> 07:07.000
But before we do that let's just get some notation out of the way.

07:07.000 --> 07:13.000
When we're talking about the length of a vector we write these double bars around it.

07:13.000 --> 07:18.000
Almost like a double absolute value around the vector.

07:18.000 --> 07:23.000
And now this is read the length of v.

07:24.000 --> 07:32.000
So going back to our vector v we have its x component is 3 and its y component is 1.

07:32.000 --> 07:42.000
So that simply means we've moved over 3 in the x direction and up 1 in the y direction.

07:42.000 --> 07:47.000
And now we've formed a right triangle.

07:47.000 --> 07:58.000
And it turns out that the length of this vector is just the hypotenuse of this triangle.

07:58.000 --> 08:01.000
And so we can just use the Pythagorean theorem.

08:01.000 --> 08:11.000
The length of v squared is equal to the 3 squared, the base squared plus the height squared.

08:11.000 --> 08:17.000
So 3 squared plus 1 squared.

08:17.000 --> 08:26.000
This is directly a direct application of the Pythagorean theorem.

08:26.000 --> 08:32.000
And so that implies if we just take the square root of both sides

08:32.000 --> 08:52.000
that the length of v is equal to the square root of 3 squared plus 1 squared.

08:52.000 --> 09:00.000
Which simplifies to the square root of 10.

09:00.000 --> 09:03.000
And it's really just as simple as that.

09:03.000 --> 09:14.000
All we're doing when we're finding the length of a vector is finding the hypotenuse of a right triangle using the Pythagorean theorem.

09:14.000 --> 09:21.000
Okay, let's look at another example.

09:21.000 --> 09:41.000
Let's say we have something like u is equal to negative 2, 7.

09:41.000 --> 09:42.000
So let's draw that.

09:42.000 --> 09:45.000
We're going to move over by 2 and up by 7.

09:45.000 --> 09:48.000
So something like that.

09:48.000 --> 09:59.000
So we've moved over negative 2 and we've moved up by 7.

09:59.000 --> 10:01.000
So maybe I'll erase that.

10:01.000 --> 10:05.000
There we go.

10:05.000 --> 10:10.000
Okay, and now the length of u again is just given by the Pythagorean theorem.

10:10.000 --> 10:17.000
And we can just skip right to the final step.

10:17.000 --> 10:30.000
And this is just going to be equal to the square root of negative 2 squared plus 7 squared.

10:30.000 --> 10:38.000
Which turns out to be 53, the square root of 53.

10:38.000 --> 10:39.000
And that's it.

10:39.000 --> 10:45.000
It's as simple as that.

10:45.000 --> 10:49.000
Okay, let's do another example here.

10:49.000 --> 11:06.000
How about w is equal to 3 negative 2.

11:06.000 --> 11:08.000
Just making stuff up.

11:08.000 --> 11:25.000
Well, then the length of w is just going to be the square root of 3 squared plus negative 2 squared.

11:25.000 --> 11:28.000
So we have 9 plus 4, so this is 13.

11:28.000 --> 11:32.000
This is the square root of 13.

11:32.000 --> 11:34.000
And we could graph that if we wanted to.

11:34.000 --> 11:39.000
We're going to go over 3 down by 2, so it's going to look something like that.

11:39.000 --> 11:43.000
And again, this is down 2 over 3.

11:43.000 --> 11:50.000
We're just talking about the hypotenuse of a right triangle.

11:50.000 --> 11:56.000
Okay, so I hope this was helpful, and I'll see you in the next video.

11:56.000 --> 11:59.000
Now that we have the basics of vectors down,

11:59.000 --> 12:03.000
we should start asking things like what can we do with vectors?

12:03.000 --> 12:07.000
Can we add vectors, for example?

12:07.000 --> 12:10.000
And the answer is yes, we can add vectors.

12:10.000 --> 12:15.000
And let's see how we would do that.

12:15.000 --> 12:20.000
So u plus v, or v plus u, I should say,

12:20.000 --> 12:30.000
v plus u is simply going to be, we're going to take the two vectors and add them.

12:30.000 --> 12:37.000
So I'm running out every step here.

12:37.000 --> 12:39.000
And how do we do this?

12:39.000 --> 12:43.000
Well, we just add their corresponding components together.

12:43.000 --> 12:49.000
So the first component of v plus u is just going to be the first component of v,

12:49.000 --> 12:55.000
which is 3, plus the first component of u.

12:55.000 --> 12:59.000
And you can see, just visually, you can see what's happening here.

12:59.000 --> 13:06.000
The second component of v plus u is just the second component of v plus the second component of u,

13:06.000 --> 13:14.000
which in our case just becomes 4, 6.

13:14.000 --> 13:18.000
So when we add vectors together, we get a new vector.

13:18.000 --> 13:26.000
And here we got the vector 4, 6.

13:26.000 --> 13:31.000
Okay, so just to save some space, let me erase these steps here.

13:31.000 --> 13:35.000
Move this over.

13:35.000 --> 13:41.000
Okay, so let's now look at this on a graph.

13:41.000 --> 13:48.000
Here is u and v, u and yellow, v and blue.

13:48.000 --> 13:53.000
Real quick, because I haven't mentioned this yet, vectors have two things.

13:53.000 --> 13:59.000
One is called a tail, it's starting point, and the other is called a head, it's ending point.

13:59.000 --> 14:04.000
I mean, they have more than two things, I guess, but they have a head and a tail.

14:04.000 --> 14:09.000
So when we add vectors, we line up their tails at a common point.

14:09.000 --> 14:12.000
Here we pick the origin just because it's convenient.

14:12.000 --> 14:15.000
So we line up their tails at that common point.

14:15.000 --> 14:27.000
And then to add them, we just take, we're going along v and then we take u and place its tail to the head of v.

14:27.000 --> 14:32.000
So you can see what this corresponds to, this is like going along u plus v.

14:32.000 --> 14:38.000
Or sorry, going along v plus u.

14:38.000 --> 14:47.000
And now the new vector is just the vector that starts at their common starting point and ends at that addition.

14:47.000 --> 14:51.000
Sorry about that.

14:51.000 --> 15:01.000
So that new vector is the vector u, I'm sorry, v plus u.

15:01.000 --> 15:08.000
And we know it has components four or six.

15:08.000 --> 15:18.000
Which makes sense if we think about it, v took us over three in the x direction and u took us over one more, so that would be four.

15:18.000 --> 15:30.000
So the new vector v plus u went over four and x and we could do a similar thing to show that it went up six and y.

15:31.000 --> 15:44.000
Okay, what else? Well, notice that we could have, if we wanted to, have gone along u first and then added v.

15:44.000 --> 15:50.000
And we would have got to the same point, which means we would have gotten the same vector.

15:50.000 --> 15:57.000
So u plus v is the same vector as v plus u.

15:57.000 --> 16:03.000
Which tells us that vector addition must be commutative.

16:03.000 --> 16:09.000
Vector addition must be commutative.

16:09.000 --> 16:21.000
And we'll prove that in a few videos from now.

16:21.000 --> 16:28.000
We'll prove that vector addition is commutative, but just visually this is kind of a geometric proof that it must be.

16:28.000 --> 16:35.000
Okay, that's vector addition. See you in the next video.

16:39.000 --> 16:44.000
Can we multiply vectors by numbers? And the answer is yes.

16:44.000 --> 16:48.000
So let's just see an example of that.

16:48.000 --> 16:55.000
If we want to multiply v by two, so two v. I'll just write it like this, two v.

16:55.000 --> 17:04.000
Component wise, this is just two times this vector.

17:04.000 --> 17:09.000
Which, we just take that two and we multiply each component by it.

17:09.000 --> 17:14.000
So this becomes, I'll write out each step here.

17:14.000 --> 17:24.000
This is two times one and then two times two, which of course simplifies to two four.

17:24.000 --> 17:31.000
The vector two four.

17:31.000 --> 17:36.000
And we call two, this number two, we call it a scalar multiple.

17:36.000 --> 17:48.000
And there's a good reason we call it that, because what it does is it scales the vector.

17:48.000 --> 17:54.000
And let me show you that. Here is our original vector, just v.

17:54.000 --> 17:59.000
Here is two v. It's twice as large. In fact, let me put regular v back.

17:59.000 --> 18:04.000
You can see there's v and when we multiply by two, it makes it twice as long.

18:04.000 --> 18:15.000
It changes the length by two, by a factor of two.

18:15.000 --> 18:17.000
Okay, there's nothing fancy about that.

18:17.000 --> 18:22.000
We can also check out what happens when we take v and we multiply by a half.

18:22.000 --> 18:26.000
It makes it half as big, half as long.

18:26.000 --> 18:34.000
What I really want to talk about is what happens when we take v and we multiply it by negative one.

18:34.000 --> 18:38.000
Well, then it flips the direction of v.

18:38.000 --> 18:42.000
Now v is going in the opposite direction.

18:42.000 --> 18:45.000
And what happens to the components?

18:45.000 --> 18:50.000
Well, that's relatively easy to figure out.

18:50.000 --> 18:52.000
Oops, I didn't need to erase those.

18:52.000 --> 18:58.000
If we take negative one times v, which I'll just abbreviate as negative v.

18:58.000 --> 19:07.000
This is negative one times one two, which simply turns out to be negative one, negative two.

19:07.000 --> 19:11.000
And it flips the direction of v.

19:11.000 --> 19:13.000
And why is that so important?

19:13.000 --> 19:17.000
Well, now we can talk about vector subtraction.

19:17.000 --> 19:26.000
We have a negative v here, and we know this works because we can multiply by that scalar of negative one.

19:26.000 --> 19:29.000
And now we have a way to talk about vector subtraction.

19:29.000 --> 19:33.000
So let's go ahead and do that. See you then.

19:33.000 --> 19:36.000
Let's take a look at vector subtraction.

19:36.000 --> 19:41.000
This is going to work the same way that it works for real numbers.

19:41.000 --> 20:00.000
If we want to do something like u minus v, this is really just the same thing as doing u plus negative v.

20:00.000 --> 20:03.000
And we know how to multiply v by negative one.

20:03.000 --> 20:05.000
That's simple enough.

20:05.000 --> 20:21.000
We're going to have u, which is three three, plus a negative four, negative one.

20:21.000 --> 20:25.000
Okay, simple enough.

20:25.000 --> 20:33.000
We do that addition and we get four, or sorry, three plus negative four is negative one.

20:33.000 --> 20:36.000
Three minus one is two.

20:36.000 --> 20:42.000
And so this subtraction is just this new vector, negative one, two.

20:42.000 --> 20:45.000
Simple enough.

20:45.000 --> 20:47.000
So now let's take a look at that on a graph.

20:47.000 --> 20:56.000
Here we have v in blue and u in orange.

20:56.000 --> 20:58.000
And now we can graph negative v.

20:58.000 --> 21:02.000
So it's just v, but pointing in the opposite direction.

21:02.000 --> 21:05.000
So there's negative v.

21:05.000 --> 21:11.000
And now to do this subtraction, we're really just doing u plus negative v.

21:11.000 --> 21:13.000
So we're just going to take the head to tail approach.

21:13.000 --> 21:19.000
We go up u and then we add negative v.

21:19.000 --> 21:30.000
And we get to this new vector, u minus v.

21:30.000 --> 21:33.000
There's our new vector.

21:33.000 --> 21:38.000
But notice that vectors, since they're translational, we can move them anywhere in the plane.

21:38.000 --> 21:43.000
We can draw u minus v here.

21:43.000 --> 21:45.000
And close off that parallelogram.

21:45.000 --> 21:49.000
This is the same vector as u minus v over there.

21:49.000 --> 21:51.000
So this is still u minus v.

21:51.000 --> 21:55.000
We just moved it over.

21:55.000 --> 22:06.000
And that's pretty interesting because that tells us that u minus v is the vector that points from the head of v to the head of u.

22:06.000 --> 22:08.000
So make sure you see that.

22:08.000 --> 22:10.000
Points from the head of v to the head of u.

22:10.000 --> 22:12.000
In fact, let me remove that.

22:12.000 --> 22:20.000
Maybe you can see it better.

22:20.000 --> 22:26.000
Okay, so we're going to use that fact when we prove something about the dot product a few videos from now.

22:26.000 --> 22:29.000
See that.

22:29.000 --> 22:34.000
Okay, so here we have a vector with three components.

22:34.000 --> 22:40.000
And now we can think of these as the x component and the y component just like before.

22:40.000 --> 22:46.000
And now we're adding in the z component.

22:46.000 --> 22:48.000
And so we have three components.

22:48.000 --> 22:51.000
We need to graph this vector in three-dimensional space.

22:51.000 --> 22:59.000
So we have these three axes here, the x axes, the y axis, and the z axis.

22:59.000 --> 23:10.000
And to graph this, all we need to do is move over one and x and four and y.

23:10.000 --> 23:12.000
So that takes us to about this point.

23:12.000 --> 23:18.000
And I'm going to draw a line from the origin to that point where we've moved to.

23:18.000 --> 23:20.000
So this is one and x, four and y.

23:20.000 --> 23:27.000
And then we just need to move up three in the z direction.

23:27.000 --> 23:30.000
And that will take us to our vector.

23:30.000 --> 23:36.000
So our vector moves one and x, four and y, and three and z.

23:36.000 --> 23:41.000
And there it is right there.

23:41.000 --> 23:55.000
Now to help with a sense of depth, I find it helpful to dash these lines here.

23:55.000 --> 24:00.000
And now that dashed line is like the shadow of v onto the xy plane.

24:00.000 --> 24:06.000
And then I also like to dash this line up for height.

24:06.000 --> 24:13.000
I just think it gives us a better sense of depth and clarity.

24:13.000 --> 24:15.000
Okay, and that's it.

24:15.000 --> 24:18.000
There's really nothing more to graphing vectors in three dimensions.

24:18.000 --> 24:21.000
I don't think you'll be asked to do that very often.

24:21.000 --> 24:28.000
But vectors with three components behave exactly the same as vectors with three components.

24:28.000 --> 24:33.000
Everything we learned for vectors with two components applies to vectors with three components,

24:33.000 --> 24:42.000
including addition, subtraction, multiplying by scalar, the translational property of vectors, so on and so forth.

24:42.000 --> 24:45.000
Okay, see you in the next video.

24:45.000 --> 24:47.000
Oh, one thing real quick.

24:47.000 --> 24:52.000
If you've never seen three-dimensional axes before, let me just explain that to you.

24:52.000 --> 24:56.000
Why they look the way they do.

24:56.000 --> 25:00.000
It's as if our whole life when we've been looking at the xy plane,

25:00.000 --> 25:07.000
it's as if we've been looking straight down the z axis.

25:07.000 --> 25:12.000
Straight down the z axis.

25:12.000 --> 25:18.000
So if we had an xy plane,

25:18.000 --> 25:21.000
here's x and y,

25:21.000 --> 25:24.000
z would be at the origin coming out straight at us.

25:24.000 --> 25:29.000
And because it's coming out straight at us, we really, we can't see it.

25:29.000 --> 25:35.000
If it were at even a slight angle, we would see it like this.

25:35.000 --> 25:39.000
This would be z coming out at us.

25:39.000 --> 25:41.000
And that's exactly what we have here.

25:41.000 --> 25:43.000
We've just chosen to rotate things.

25:43.000 --> 25:50.000
So you could see that the x kind of swings down and y swings down into its place and z rotates up.

25:50.000 --> 26:01.000
So things are rotated, but it's really, it should seem familiar in that sense once you realize what's going on.

26:01.000 --> 26:05.000
Okay, anyways, I hope that was helpful. I'll see you in the next video.

26:05.000 --> 26:11.000
Let's talk about finding the length of a vector that has three components.

26:11.000 --> 26:17.000
So here we have the vector v equal to 1, 4, 3.

26:17.000 --> 26:22.000
And I want to find its length.

26:22.000 --> 26:26.000
In a previous video, we've graphed this vector.

26:26.000 --> 26:34.000
And I want to point your attention to the fact that we have a right triangle here.

26:34.000 --> 26:42.000
This dashed line and this dashed line form the base and the height of the triangle.

26:42.000 --> 26:46.000
And the vector is the hypotenuse.

26:46.000 --> 26:53.000
And I'll draw in a little square symbol so maybe you can see it better.

26:53.000 --> 27:03.000
There's a triangle there. It's a little bit at an angle to us, but it's definitely a right triangle sitting there.

27:03.000 --> 27:10.000
Okay, so knowing that we can just apply the Pythagorean theorem.

27:10.000 --> 27:25.000
And the length of v is simply the square root of the base of that triangle squared plus the height of the triangle squared.

27:25.000 --> 27:31.000
So now all we have to do is figure out what is the base and what is the height of that triangle.

27:31.000 --> 27:37.000
Well the height is easy. The height is how far we go up in z.

27:37.000 --> 27:40.000
And we're just going up three units in z.

27:40.000 --> 27:44.000
So the height is just simply three.

27:44.000 --> 27:53.000
Okay, take care of that. This is b squared plus three squared.

27:53.000 --> 27:58.000
Now what about b?

27:58.000 --> 28:10.000
Well if you look closely you'll notice that there's another right triangle right here.

28:10.000 --> 28:21.000
And that triangle, or what I should say is b is the hypotenuse of this triangle that I've filled in with yellow.

28:21.000 --> 28:35.000
In fact let me pull that triangle out.

28:35.000 --> 28:38.000
So this is the triangle I'm talking about.

28:38.000 --> 28:43.000
b is the hypotenuse.

28:43.000 --> 28:47.000
Once again for clarity, this is the triangle that I've pulled out.

28:47.000 --> 28:50.000
It's this triangle here.

28:50.000 --> 28:53.000
Okay well what are the sides of this triangle?

28:53.000 --> 29:00.000
We know that we moved over one there and four here.

29:00.000 --> 29:04.000
So we can just apply the Pythagorean theorem again.

29:04.000 --> 29:19.000
And we can say that b now is equal to one squared, the square root of one squared plus four squared.

29:19.000 --> 29:23.000
That's what b is.

29:23.000 --> 29:34.000
Well now that we have a term for b, let's go ahead and plug that in.

29:34.000 --> 29:44.000
So we have b which is the square root of one squared plus four squared.

29:44.000 --> 29:49.000
And now b is being squared.

29:49.000 --> 30:01.000
And then plus three squared.

30:01.000 --> 30:03.000
Well something really nice just happened.

30:03.000 --> 30:06.000
Look at, we have a square root being squared.

30:06.000 --> 30:11.000
And so that square root just simply goes away.

30:11.000 --> 30:20.000
So this whole thing simplifies to the square root of one squared plus four squared

30:20.000 --> 30:30.000
because that square root went away plus three squared.

30:30.000 --> 30:35.000
Now compare that to the components of v.

30:35.000 --> 30:47.000
You'll see that the length of v is simply the square root of the sum of the squares of the components.

30:47.000 --> 30:51.000
And that's kind of a lot of words to say all at once.

30:51.000 --> 30:58.000
But we just take each component, we square it, we add them together and we take the square root.

30:58.000 --> 31:03.000
Okay let's do another example.

31:03.000 --> 31:20.000
Let's say we have u is equal to, I don't know one, negative six, four.

31:20.000 --> 31:25.000
What is the length of u?

31:25.000 --> 31:29.000
Well we don't need to go through the whole process that we went through.

31:29.000 --> 31:37.000
Just remember, as long as we understand what we did we can just remember that the end result is just going to be,

31:37.000 --> 31:45.000
we take each component, we square it, we add them all together and we take the square root.

31:45.000 --> 31:50.000
So simply the square root of one squared plus negative six squared plus four squared.

31:50.000 --> 31:53.000
And that's it.

31:53.000 --> 32:02.000
If you want we can do another example.

32:02.000 --> 32:12.000
How about negative three zero nine?

32:12.000 --> 32:30.000
So the length of w is equal to, what am I doing?

32:30.000 --> 32:39.000
It's equal to the square root of negative three squared plus zero squared plus nine squared.

32:39.000 --> 32:44.000
And there you have it. There's the length of a vector with three components.

32:44.000 --> 32:50.000
If you're wondering what happens, if you have more than three components, let me show you that quickly.

32:50.000 --> 33:07.000
And I might make a separate video about this, but let's say we had something like v is equal to v1, v2, v3, and v4.

33:07.000 --> 33:12.000
So now we have four components.

33:12.000 --> 33:24.000
The length of v, you might be able to guess what it's going to be,

33:24.000 --> 33:40.000
the square root of v1 squared plus v2 squared plus v3 squared plus v4 squared.

33:40.000 --> 33:43.000
And if you had five components, you'd do the same thing.

33:43.000 --> 33:47.000
You'd just add, tack that fifth one on at the end.

33:47.000 --> 33:51.000
If you had six, you would do the same thing, just tack those on.

33:51.000 --> 33:57.000
So that's the vector length for vectors with more than two components.

33:57.000 --> 34:02.000
Okay, see you in the next video.

34:02.000 --> 34:06.000
Okay, here we have three vectors, v, u, and w.

34:06.000 --> 34:11.000
And so far we've looked at vectors with two components,

34:11.000 --> 34:20.000
and when we were graphing them or thinking about them visually, we thought about them in the plane, in two dimensions.

34:21.000 --> 34:29.000
When we had a vector with three components, we graphed this in three dimensions.

34:29.000 --> 34:49.000
And in fact, we even labeled this as the x, y, and z component corresponding to the x, y, and z axes.

34:50.000 --> 34:59.000
When we go to higher dimensions, dimensions greater than three,

34:59.000 --> 35:04.000
so here we have a vector w with n dimensions.

35:04.000 --> 35:09.000
Let's say, for example, that n is four.

35:09.000 --> 35:12.000
So this vector has four components.

35:12.000 --> 35:16.000
Now we don't try and graph this anymore.

35:16.000 --> 35:22.000
Anytime a vector has more than three components, we really can't graph it.

35:22.000 --> 35:23.000
We can't visualize it.

35:23.000 --> 35:29.000
We don't have a good way to graph four or five or six dimensions.

35:29.000 --> 35:33.000
But the beauty of linear algebra and the power of linear algebra

35:33.000 --> 35:41.000
is the fact that we can take what we know from here and from here, for that matter,

35:41.000 --> 35:52.000
and we can push those concepts to higher dimensions to four dimensions, five dimensions, a hundred dimensions, a thousand dimensions.

35:52.000 --> 36:04.000
You know, we don't have to graph things, but the tools that we've created will still apply.

36:04.000 --> 36:07.000
Okay.

36:07.000 --> 36:13.000
So let's talk about some technical details here.

36:13.000 --> 36:19.000
One is the fact that vectors are ordered lists of numbers.

36:19.000 --> 36:21.000
They're ordered lists of components, right?

36:21.000 --> 36:26.000
First, this vector has the component v1 and then it has v2.

36:26.000 --> 36:31.000
We already talked about the order, how the order matters.

36:31.000 --> 36:41.000
Well, that means that v is what's called a two-tuple.

36:41.000 --> 36:46.000
And a tuple is nothing more than an ordered list of elements.

36:46.000 --> 36:52.000
v is an ordered list of real numbers, an ordered list of components.

36:52.000 --> 36:54.000
So v is a two-tuple.

36:54.000 --> 36:58.000
It's a two-tuple because there's two of them.

36:58.000 --> 37:03.000
Just like u is a three-tuple, it's an ordered list of three components.

37:03.000 --> 37:08.000
And w is an n-tuple.

37:08.000 --> 37:16.000
It's an ordered list of n-components.

37:16.000 --> 37:18.000
Okay.

37:18.000 --> 37:27.000
Now we have the tools for talking about the definition of rn.

37:27.000 --> 37:39.000
And rn is really just the set of all n-tuples of real numbers.

37:39.000 --> 37:49.000
So, for example, if you have a vector with two components,

37:49.000 --> 37:57.000
that is an element of r2.

37:57.000 --> 38:02.000
Because r2 is the set of all two-tuples.

38:02.000 --> 38:09.000
Well, v is just one of those two-tuples.

38:09.000 --> 38:12.000
So v must be in r2.

38:12.000 --> 38:16.000
And r2, we can loosely think of it as this plane.

38:16.000 --> 38:19.000
I mean, we haven't defined what a dimension is,

38:19.000 --> 38:22.000
but we can think of it as the two-dimensional plane.

38:22.000 --> 38:27.000
So this is r2.

38:27.000 --> 38:34.000
Just like u is an element of r3.

38:34.000 --> 38:39.000
r3 is all three-tuples of real numbers.

38:39.000 --> 38:44.000
And u just happens to be one of those three-tuples of real numbers.

38:44.000 --> 38:47.000
So u is in r3.

38:47.000 --> 38:52.000
And r3 we can think of as the three dimensions.

38:52.000 --> 38:55.000
And again, we haven't formally defined dimension,

38:55.000 --> 38:58.000
but we can think of it like that.

38:58.000 --> 39:09.000
w, similar to the rest, is an element of rn.

39:09.000 --> 39:15.000
rn is the set of all n-tuples of real numbers.

39:15.000 --> 39:18.000
w is an n-tuple of real numbers.

39:18.000 --> 39:22.000
So it's in rn.

39:22.000 --> 39:28.000
w is an element of rn.

39:28.000 --> 39:31.000
Okay, so I know this is a lot all at once,

39:31.000 --> 39:35.000
but really what's important here is this notation.

39:35.000 --> 39:37.000
To me, that's what's important.

39:37.000 --> 39:39.000
This is going to come up all the time.

39:39.000 --> 39:42.000
We're going to use it throughout the rest of the course.

39:42.000 --> 39:44.000
And if it helps you remember,

39:44.000 --> 39:46.000
just remember that the number up here

39:46.000 --> 39:51.000
is going to be the same as the number of components.

39:51.000 --> 39:55.000
So we can read this if we want.

39:55.000 --> 39:57.000
Instead of v is an element of r2,

39:57.000 --> 40:02.000
we could just read this as v is a vector with two components.

40:02.000 --> 40:04.000
u is a vector with three components.

40:04.000 --> 40:09.000
w is a vector with n components.

40:09.000 --> 40:11.000
Okay, so I just wanted to lay this out there

40:11.000 --> 40:13.000
so that we're all on the same page,

40:13.000 --> 40:14.000
and we'll move from here.

40:14.000 --> 40:16.000
See you then.

40:16.000 --> 40:24.000
Oh, also, we'll expand upon this idea of w,

40:24.000 --> 40:26.000
or sorry, of a vector in rn,

40:26.000 --> 40:28.000
how we can work with that

40:28.000 --> 40:32.000
and abstract some of the ideas

40:32.000 --> 40:35.000
that we learned in two and three dimensions.

40:35.000 --> 40:39.000
Okay, see you then.

40:39.000 --> 40:43.000
Okay, so here we've seen the length of a vector

40:43.000 --> 40:46.000
with two components.

40:46.000 --> 40:48.000
In fact, we just used the Pythagorean theorem

40:48.000 --> 40:50.000
to figure out this length.

40:50.000 --> 40:53.000
It's just the square root of the first component squared

40:53.000 --> 40:57.000
plus the second component squared.

40:57.000 --> 41:00.000
In three dimensions, in a vector with three components,

41:00.000 --> 41:02.000
we derived this length

41:02.000 --> 41:05.000
using the Pythagorean theorem twice in a row,

41:05.000 --> 41:07.000
and you can go back and watch that video if you want,

41:07.000 --> 41:11.000
and we found the length of a vector in r3

41:11.000 --> 41:15.000
is just the square root of u1 squared plus u2 squared

41:15.000 --> 41:18.000
plus u3 squared.

41:18.000 --> 41:23.000
A vector in rn, the length is defined to be as follows.

41:30.000 --> 41:37.000
This is just equal to the square root of w1 squared

41:37.000 --> 41:42.000
plus w2 squared plus everything in between,

41:42.000 --> 41:46.000
so w3 squared plus w4 squared, so on,

41:46.000 --> 41:53.000
all the way up till you get to the last component.

41:53.000 --> 41:56.000
So it's really you just take each component individually,

41:56.000 --> 41:59.000
you square it, you add all those together,

41:59.000 --> 42:01.000
and then you take the square root.

42:01.000 --> 42:04.000
That's how you find the length of any vector.

42:04.000 --> 42:12.000
Okay, just figured I would fill you in on that.

42:12.000 --> 42:15.000
See you in the next video.

42:15.000 --> 42:17.000
Here we're being asked to prove that vector addition

42:17.000 --> 42:20.000
is commutative and associative,

42:20.000 --> 42:25.000
so this will be our first proof in the linear algebra course.

42:26.000 --> 42:30.000
First of all, let's just define three vectors,

42:30.000 --> 42:33.000
u, v, and w are all in rn,

42:33.000 --> 42:36.000
so they're three vectors with n components,

42:36.000 --> 42:40.000
and let's figure out what we're trying to prove.

42:40.000 --> 42:43.000
So we're trying to prove that vector addition is commutative,

42:43.000 --> 42:46.000
so u plus v is the same as v plus u,

42:46.000 --> 42:51.000
and associative, so u plus v in parentheses plus w

42:51.000 --> 42:55.000
is the same as u plus v plus w.

42:55.000 --> 42:58.000
Okay, so how are we going to do this?

42:58.000 --> 43:01.000
Excuse me.

43:01.000 --> 43:11.000
First of all, let's just start with u plus v.

43:11.000 --> 43:16.000
So here's u plus v.

43:16.000 --> 43:19.000
And what is this equal to?

43:19.000 --> 43:22.000
So what's the definition of vector addition?

43:22.000 --> 43:24.000
Well, we've already gone over this.

43:24.000 --> 43:34.000
It's u1 plus v1 comma u2 plus v2,

43:34.000 --> 43:37.000
and that keeps going until you get to the last component,

43:37.000 --> 43:44.000
un plus vn, and this is the new vector.

43:44.000 --> 43:49.000
This is the vector u plus v.

43:49.000 --> 43:55.000
Okay, well, remember, these are real numbers.

43:55.000 --> 44:01.000
The components of vectors in rn are real numbers,

44:01.000 --> 44:05.000
and so we can use the commutative property of addition

44:05.000 --> 44:10.000
of real numbers to switch those around.

44:10.000 --> 44:15.000
So this is the same as v1 plus u1

44:15.000 --> 44:17.000
because those are just real numbers,

44:17.000 --> 44:21.000
and addition of real numbers is commutative.

44:21.000 --> 44:27.000
v2 plus u2, and you keep going until you get to the end,

44:27.000 --> 44:33.000
vn plus un.

44:33.000 --> 44:43.000
Well, now here, this is the definition of v plus u.

44:43.000 --> 44:48.000
That's how we define v plus u.

44:48.000 --> 44:52.000
And so we have a simple algebraic proof here

44:52.000 --> 44:55.000
that u plus v is equal to v plus u.

44:55.000 --> 44:58.000
It's not really formal, there's no formal writings,

44:58.000 --> 45:04.000
but I think you can see clearly it's a proof.

45:04.000 --> 45:13.000
Okay, how about proving that vector addition is associative?

45:13.000 --> 45:16.000
Well, I want you to pause and try that on your own,

45:16.000 --> 45:18.000
but the strategy is going to be the same.

45:18.000 --> 45:22.000
What we did is we went ahead and used the properties of real numbers,

45:22.000 --> 45:25.000
the fact that real numbers are commutative,

45:25.000 --> 45:27.000
to prove that vectors are commutative.

45:27.000 --> 45:30.000
And we're going to use that same strategy for associative,

45:30.000 --> 45:33.000
for the associative property.

45:33.000 --> 45:41.000
Okay, pause and try that on your own.

45:41.000 --> 45:43.000
Okay, hopefully you're back from pausing the video

45:43.000 --> 45:46.000
and trying to prove that vectors are associative.

45:46.000 --> 45:49.000
And now let's go through it.

45:49.000 --> 46:03.000
So we have u plus v plus w.

46:03.000 --> 46:09.000
Well, we know that u plus v is going to be its own vector.

46:09.000 --> 46:14.000
It's going to be the vector u1 plus v1.

46:14.000 --> 46:17.000
And I'm just going to leave off the second component.

46:17.000 --> 46:19.000
We all, you've seen it enough times.

46:19.000 --> 46:21.000
We know what's happening.

46:21.000 --> 46:26.000
Down to u n plus v n.

46:26.000 --> 46:32.000
So that's this whole vector here.

46:32.000 --> 46:42.000
We can think of u plus v as its own new vector, plus w.

46:43.000 --> 46:46.000
And again, I'm going to leave off the second one

46:46.000 --> 46:53.000
and just write it like that.

46:53.000 --> 46:58.000
Okay, well, now we're just adding two vectors together.

46:58.000 --> 46:59.000
And we know how to do that.

46:59.000 --> 47:02.000
We take the first component of the first vector,

47:02.000 --> 47:05.000
which is u1 plus v1.

47:05.000 --> 47:08.000
That's the first component of that vector.

47:08.000 --> 47:11.000
And then we add the first component of the other vector,

47:11.000 --> 47:14.000
which is just w1.

47:14.000 --> 47:20.000
And we do that for each component, each of the components,

47:20.000 --> 47:30.000
until we get to u n plus v n plus w n.

47:30.000 --> 47:37.000
Okay, and now, again, we have real numbers here

47:37.000 --> 47:40.000
and real numbers are associative.

47:40.000 --> 47:42.000
Addition of real numbers is associative.

47:42.000 --> 47:48.000
And so we're just going to use that property of real numbers.

47:48.000 --> 47:58.000
So this is the same thing as u1 plus v1 plus w1.

47:58.000 --> 48:00.000
Remember, these components are just real numbers,

48:00.000 --> 48:05.000
so the associative property of addition holds.

48:05.000 --> 48:20.000
Okay, and we'll do that all the way through all of these components.

48:20.000 --> 48:25.000
And we're almost done.

48:25.000 --> 48:34.000
And now we can break this up into the vector u.

48:34.000 --> 48:52.000
u1 all the way to u n plus the vector v1 plus w1

48:52.000 --> 49:01.000
all the way to the end, the n plus w n.

49:01.000 --> 49:14.000
And this, of course, is just u plus v plus w.

49:14.000 --> 49:23.000
And so we've proved that vector addition is associative.

49:23.000 --> 49:31.000
So again, it's a really simple method.

49:31.000 --> 49:34.000
All we're doing is a really simple process.

49:34.000 --> 49:36.000
That's the word I was looking for.

49:36.000 --> 49:39.000
All we're doing is taking the vectors,

49:39.000 --> 49:41.000
breaking them down into their components.

49:41.000 --> 49:44.000
And since the components are real numbers,

49:44.000 --> 49:48.000
we can use the properties of real numbers on the component level.

49:48.000 --> 49:52.000
And then we're kind of pulling things back out into vectors.

49:52.000 --> 49:54.000
Okay, I hope this was helpful.

49:54.000 --> 49:58.000
We'll see the rest of the properties of vectors in the next video.

49:58.000 --> 50:00.000
See you then.

50:00.000 --> 50:05.000
Okay, here are some of the algebraic properties of vectors.

50:05.000 --> 50:08.000
I encourage you to try and prove all of these.

50:08.000 --> 50:11.000
We just proved that vector addition is commutative,

50:11.000 --> 50:13.000
so that's number one here.

50:13.000 --> 50:15.000
We just proved that in the last video.

50:15.000 --> 50:17.000
Very similarly to the way we proved that,

50:17.000 --> 50:21.000
you could prove all of these if you know properties of real numbers.

50:22.000 --> 50:26.000
You know addition for real numbers is associative,

50:26.000 --> 50:28.000
and that's what we have here in step number two,

50:28.000 --> 50:31.000
so you probably can prove that pretty easily.

50:31.000 --> 50:34.000
When you add a real number to zero,

50:34.000 --> 50:37.000
you get that real number back.

50:37.000 --> 50:40.000
So you can go through all of these pretty easily.

50:40.000 --> 50:47.000
And like I said, just use the properties of real numbers that you know.

50:47.000 --> 50:53.000
One interesting thing here is we have this thing called the zero vector.

50:53.000 --> 50:56.000
And the zero vector is a little bit different than zero.

50:56.000 --> 51:00.000
It's a vector whose components are all zero.

51:00.000 --> 51:03.000
And that distinction is somewhat important

51:03.000 --> 51:08.000
because we can't add just a regular number zero to a vector.

51:08.000 --> 51:11.000
We have to add a vector to a vector.

51:11.000 --> 51:14.000
So when we do this addition, we need this to be a zero vector,

51:14.000 --> 51:18.000
so we can add each of the components together.

51:18.000 --> 51:20.000
But okay, so this is just for reference.

51:20.000 --> 51:22.000
You can view it at any time.

51:22.000 --> 51:25.000
I hope they'll have a reference sheet on the website

51:25.000 --> 51:27.000
that you can look at and print off.

51:27.000 --> 51:32.000
So we can use these from now on with vectors.

51:32.000 --> 51:34.000
See you in the next video.

51:34.000 --> 51:37.000
So if you've been following along so far,

51:37.000 --> 51:41.000
you may have noticed that we haven't talked about multiplying two vectors.

51:42.000 --> 51:47.000
And that's because there's a couple different ways to multiply vectors

51:47.000 --> 51:50.000
or to define a product of vectors.

51:50.000 --> 51:53.000
And one really interesting and useful one is called the dot product.

51:53.000 --> 51:57.000
So when you see this dot here that indicates the dot product,

51:57.000 --> 52:02.000
and the way the dot product is defined is maybe somewhat surprising.

52:02.000 --> 52:10.000
The way that we do this is we do u1 times v1 plus u2 times v2.

52:11.000 --> 52:14.000
Plus u3 times v3, so on and so on.

52:14.000 --> 52:22.000
All the way until we get to the end, un plus un times vn.

52:22.000 --> 52:24.000
Why is that surprising?

52:24.000 --> 52:28.000
Why is that a surprising way to define a product of two vectors?

52:28.000 --> 52:30.000
Well, look at the result.

52:30.000 --> 52:33.000
What kind of object is this?

52:33.000 --> 52:35.000
It's a number.

52:35.000 --> 52:37.000
These two things are numbers.

52:37.000 --> 52:40.000
When we multiply them, we just get a real number plus another real number.

52:40.000 --> 52:42.000
All the way across.

52:42.000 --> 52:45.000
When we add all these up, that's just a single number.

52:45.000 --> 52:48.000
So you multiply two vectors and you just get a number out.

52:48.000 --> 52:53.000
So you don't even get a vector back when you multiply two vectors with a dot product.

52:53.000 --> 52:58.000
So this is sometimes called the scalar product for that reason that the result is a scalar.

52:58.000 --> 53:00.000
It's a real number, a constant.

53:00.000 --> 53:04.000
Those are all different ways of saying the same thing.

53:04.000 --> 53:09.000
So for slightly different notation and maybe a little bit more concise notation,

53:09.000 --> 53:19.000
is we could use summation notation or sigma notation and just write this like this.

53:19.000 --> 53:26.000
So we sum up all the components from one to n, the products of those components.

53:26.000 --> 53:31.000
So if you're comfortable and familiar with sigma notation, this is one way to write it.

53:31.000 --> 53:37.000
I personally actually prefer this way up here because it's a little bit more informative, I think.

53:37.000 --> 53:42.000
It's a little bit easier to see just right away without interpreting the sigma notation.

53:42.000 --> 53:45.000
Anyways, that's that.

53:45.000 --> 53:49.000
Let's do an example.

53:49.000 --> 54:15.000
So if we have u is equal to 1, negative 2, and 5, and v is equal to 4, 3, and 1.

54:15.000 --> 54:18.000
So what is this dot product?

54:18.000 --> 54:20.000
Well, we just do exactly what it says.

54:20.000 --> 54:30.000
1 times 4 plus negative 2 times 3 plus 5 times 1.

54:30.000 --> 54:35.000
So we get 4 minus 6 plus 5.

54:35.000 --> 54:40.000
That looks like 3 to me.

54:41.000 --> 54:51.000
So maybe what I should have written was this is u minus v, or sorry, u dot v.

54:51.000 --> 54:54.000
u dot v is equal to this.

54:54.000 --> 55:00.000
We're taking u1 times v1 plus u2 times v2 plus u3 times vt, v3.

55:00.000 --> 55:06.000
And then we're just simplifying the numbers and it comes out to 3.

55:06.000 --> 55:14.000
So this maybe seems a little bit bizarre, but we'll see in the coming videos why this dot product is really useful.

55:14.000 --> 55:16.000
See you then.

55:16.000 --> 55:20.000
Let's look at some interesting consequences of the dot product.

55:20.000 --> 55:28.000
And the first one that I want to look at is the consequence it has for the definition of the length of a vector.

55:28.000 --> 55:38.000
It turns out that because the way the dot product is defined, we can think of the length of the vector as the square root of the vector dotted with itself.

55:38.000 --> 55:41.000
And why does that make any sense?

55:41.000 --> 55:53.000
Well, if we think about what this is equal to, this dot product here is just u1 times u1, which is u1 squared, plus u2 times u2,

55:53.000 --> 56:00.000
which is u2 squared, plus all the way up to un times un, so un squared.

56:00.000 --> 56:02.000
So that just comes from the definition of a dot product.

56:02.000 --> 56:06.000
We take each of the components, we multiply them together, and we add them up.

56:06.000 --> 56:10.000
And we already said that this is how we are going to define the length of a vector.

56:10.000 --> 56:16.000
Remember, we did this in two dimensions where we used the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of a vector.

56:16.000 --> 56:20.000
In more dimensions, we just keep adding the squares of the components.

56:20.000 --> 56:25.000
If we have any more components we have, we square them and we add them underneath the square root.

56:25.000 --> 56:33.000
So that's the length of a vector, and so it makes sense that the square root of u dot u is the length of the vector.

56:33.000 --> 56:48.000
Also notice that, you know, this is a pretty natural follow up, but the length of a vector squared, that means, is equal to the vector dotted with itself.

56:48.000 --> 56:52.000
So we just squared both sides of this.

56:52.000 --> 56:58.000
Okay, that's pretty cool.

56:58.000 --> 57:00.000
What else?

57:00.000 --> 57:12.000
Well, the more interesting thing that happens is it has to do with the angle between two vectors.

57:12.000 --> 57:21.000
So let's say this is u, and this is v, and this is theta.

57:21.000 --> 57:27.000
Well, what if we did u minus v? We already talked about what u minus v is.

57:27.000 --> 57:31.000
It's the vector that points from v to u.

57:31.000 --> 57:39.000
Now, we've drawn a triangle here. What we can do is we can use the law of cosines to help us figure out this angle in here,

57:39.000 --> 57:44.000
or to help us figure out this side, u minus v.

57:44.000 --> 57:52.000
So the law of cosines tells us that the length of the side we're trying to find, u minus v,

57:52.000 --> 57:59.000
so this is going all the way back to your geometry class, and you can look up the law of cosines if you don't remember it,

57:59.000 --> 58:07.000
but that length squared is equal to the length of one of the sides, that's u,

58:07.000 --> 58:21.000
the length of u squared plus the length of v squared minus the length of u times the length of v.

58:21.000 --> 58:27.000
So I know that these length symbols get really tedious, but I'm just going to keep going with them here.

58:27.000 --> 58:33.000
So minus the length of u times the length of v times the cosine of the angle between them.

58:33.000 --> 58:41.000
So this comes from the law of cosines. It's really just saying c squared is equal to a squared plus b squared minus ab cos theta.

58:41.000 --> 58:47.000
You might remember it better that way, but that's what we have. We have a side u minus v and a side u and a side v.

58:47.000 --> 58:52.000
So what we're going to do now is we're going to examine this side.

58:52.000 --> 58:56.000
So let's pull that side out and look at it separately.

58:56.000 --> 59:06.000
So we have the length of u minus v squared, well that's just u minus v dotted with u minus v, so let's do that.

59:06.000 --> 59:12.000
u minus v dotted with itself.

59:12.000 --> 59:22.000
And now there's some properties of dot products that I haven't told you about that are going to become useful here,

59:22.000 --> 59:26.000
like commutativity, but we'll see that in action.

59:26.000 --> 59:32.000
So u dot u, well we just talked about that, that's the length of u squared, so let's write that as that.

59:32.000 --> 59:40.000
u dot u is the length of u squared.

59:40.000 --> 59:50.000
And then we have u dot, oh I have dot products in there, sorry that's a mistake, this should be u minus v, u minus v.

59:50.000 --> 01:00:06.000
So u dotted with minus v, that's minus, so let me write that on the side, minus u v, well minus u dot v.

01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:16.000
And then we have minus v dot u, so that's minus v dot u, but like I just said the dot product is commutative,

01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:23.000
so this becomes, when we add those two together we just get minus two u dot v.

01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:26.000
So I hope that was relatively clear.

01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:32.000
We're just foiling this out with the dot product.

01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:42.000
So based on what we just talked about that's minus two times u dot v.

01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:52.000
So just to be explicit, really explicit here, that was this u coming over here and this v coming this way.

01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:59.000
So I had to pause the video because my phone was ringing, but yeah like I was saying this, u comes and multiplies that v,

01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:04.000
this v comes and multiplies that u, so we get minus two u dot v.

01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:15.000
And then finally the v dotted with itself, well it's both negative so that's going to be plus the length of v squared.

01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:19.000
This is just v dot v, turns out to be.

01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:22.000
So this is what the left hand side of the equation becomes.

01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:32.000
So why don't we substitute that into this, the law of cosines essentially, what we have.

01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:52.000
So this is u squared, the length of u squared, minus two u dot v, plus the length of v squared, is equal to the length of u squared.

01:01:52.000 --> 01:02:00.000
So this is now the right hand side of the equation from up there, plus the length of v squared,

01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:10.000
minus the length of u times the length of v times the cosine of the angle between them.

01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:17.000
Okay so now we get to do a lot of canceling here, so let's see.

01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:22.000
This and this are going to go away, we can subtract those from both sides, those are going to go away.

01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:25.000
Oh jeez I did something terribly wrong here.

01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:29.000
This is not the law of cosines, we need a minus two.

01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:32.000
That means we need a minus two down here.

01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:38.000
And then we can divide the minus two on both sides though, so that's pretty cool.

01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:40.000
So sorry for forgetting that for the whole video.

01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:44.000
And what do we end up with after we do all that crazy cancellation?

01:02:44.000 --> 01:03:04.000
Well we just end up with u dot v on this side is equal to the length of u times the length of v times the cosine of the angle between them.

01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:13.000
And now that is really cool because as long as we're given the vectors u and v, we could figure out what u dot v is based on the definition,

01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:20.000
sum up the products of the components, and then we can figure out the lengths, we know how to do that,

01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:25.000
we just take the square root of the sum of the square of the components,

01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:29.000
and then we have this cosine of theta so we can solve for theta,

01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:34.000
and we can figure out the angle between two vectors just knowing what the two vectors are.

01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:35.000
So that's really cool.

01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:49.000
So in fact, remember that this proof came from the law of cosines which only really works in two dimensions, we're talking about a triangle.

01:03:49.000 --> 01:04:14.000
So when we go to higher dimensions we take it as a definition that the cosine of theta is equal to u dot v divided by the length of u times the length of v.

01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:18.000
So that just comes because we just divided by length of u, length of v.

01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:22.000
So notice two things happen here.

01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:30.000
One, we have an alternate definition for the dot product or an alternate way to express the dot product.

01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:38.000
And also now we have a way to express the angle between two vectors in terms of the dot product.

01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:40.000
And that's really cool.

01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:41.000
So I hope this helps.

01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:43.000
I'll see you in the next video.

01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:48.000
Let's use what we know about the dot product to find the angle between these two vectors.

01:04:48.000 --> 01:05:12.000
So what we're going to do is remember our little formula which says that the cosine of the angle between two vectors is equal to u dot v divided by the length of u times the length of v.

01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:17.000
So if we want to find the angle between two vectors we have to do just a few computations.

01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:25.000
We have to find the dot product and then we have to find the length of each vector.

01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:28.000
So let's go through that.

01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:50.000
So the dot product of u and v, so u dot v, u dot v is equal to two times one, that's two, plus one times one, that's one, plus negative two times one, that's just negative two or minus two.

01:05:50.000 --> 01:05:56.000
So this comes out to be one.

01:05:56.000 --> 01:06:00.000
So the dot product is one, let's do the length of u now in the length of v.

01:06:00.000 --> 01:06:12.000
So the length of u is equal to the square root of two squared plus one squared plus negative two squared.

01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:19.000
So two squared is four, plus one squared is one, plus negative two squared is four, so plus four.

01:06:19.000 --> 01:06:26.000
So this is the square root of nine if we add those together and the square root of nine is just three.

01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:30.000
And now let's do the length of v.

01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:38.000
So all we're doing is just doing the necessary computations based on this formula and we derived this formula in the last video.

01:06:38.000 --> 01:06:41.000
So if you're curious about that go back and watch that.

01:06:41.000 --> 01:06:47.000
So now we have one squared, well that's just one, plus one squared, well that's one, plus one squared, that's one.

01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:52.000
So this is the square root of three.

01:06:52.000 --> 01:06:58.000
So we have our necessary pieces here, so let's put them all together.

01:06:58.000 --> 01:07:09.000
So we have the cosine of the angle between the two vectors is equal to the dot product of the two vectors, which we found was equal to one,

01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:16.000
divided by the length of u, that's three times the length of v, that's the square root of three.

01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:35.000
So this is the cosine of the angle, so to find the angle theta is just equal to the arc cos or the inverse cos of one divided by three times the square root of three.

01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:42.000
And now to find this we would have to use a calculator or a table of values.

01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:49.000
And so I'll spare us the pain, but you should maybe do that on your calculator just to make sure you get the right answer.

01:07:49.000 --> 01:08:00.000
And this comes out to 1.37 radians, or I should write this is approximately equal, rounding a little bit or truncating.

01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:15.000
So this is approximately equal to 1.37 radians, and if your calculator is in degree mode, then that's approximately 78.9 degrees.

01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:18.000
Okay, so nothing too terribly difficult.

01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:24.000
We just got to compute the dot product, compute the length of the vectors, and everything falls into place.

01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:27.000
Okay, see you in the next video.

01:08:27.000 --> 01:08:33.000
In the last video we learned the definition of the cosine between two vectors.

01:08:33.000 --> 01:08:42.000
In fact, we pretty much derived this, so we said the cosine of the angle between two vectors is u dot v divided by the length of u times the length of v.

01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:50.000
So let's see what we can determine about two vectors when they're perpendicular.

01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:56.000
So if two vectors are perpendicular, what we say is they're orthogonal.

01:08:56.000 --> 01:09:00.000
So that's the word we use for perpendicular vectors.

01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:02.000
And let's see what we can determine.

01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:04.000
So u and v here.

01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:11.000
So this angle, of course, is pi over 2, or 90 degrees.

01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:13.000
And what does that mean?

01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:29.000
Well, by our definition of the angle between two vectors, that means that the cosine of pi over 2 is equal to this dot product.

01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:33.000
And while I'm writing this, think about what is the cosine of pi over 2?

01:09:33.000 --> 01:09:35.000
What is that equal to?

01:09:35.000 --> 01:09:41.000
We know what it is, it's just a number, right?

01:09:41.000 --> 01:09:45.000
Well, the cosine of pi over 2 is zero.

01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:51.000
So all three of these things are equal, and they're all equal to zero.

01:09:51.000 --> 01:09:54.000
Excuse me.

01:09:54.000 --> 01:09:56.000
So what does that tell us?

01:09:56.000 --> 01:10:03.000
Well, that tells us that u dot v must be equal to zero.

01:10:03.000 --> 01:10:09.000
So this implies that u dot v is equal to zero.

01:10:09.000 --> 01:10:14.000
And that's because the denominator here will never make this fraction zero.

01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:20.000
Okay, so if the vectors are orthogonal, then the dot product is zero.

01:10:20.000 --> 01:10:22.000
And in fact, that works in the other direction.

01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:26.000
If the dot product is zero, the vectors are orthogonal.

01:10:26.000 --> 01:10:29.000
So now we have a definition of orthogonal.

01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:32.000
Two vectors are orthogonal.

01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:40.000
So two, well, let me write this, two vectors u and v are orthogonal if and only if.

01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:45.000
If you've never seen this before, this is shorthand notation for if and only if.

01:10:45.000 --> 01:10:56.000
Two vectors are u and v are orthogonal if and only if u dot v is equal to zero.

01:10:56.000 --> 01:11:01.000
So now we have a nice, easy way to test if two vectors are orthogonal.

01:11:01.000 --> 01:11:06.000
So let's take a look at that.

01:11:06.000 --> 01:11:12.000
So let's take some two easy vectors with just two components and see what happens.

01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:28.000
So let's say u is equal to negative three, four, and v is equal to four, three.

01:11:28.000 --> 01:11:32.000
So let's do their dot product really quickly.

01:11:32.000 --> 01:11:45.000
u dot v is equal to negative three times four, negative three times four, plus four times three.

01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:51.000
Well, it's pretty clear this is negative 12 plus 12, so that's zero.

01:11:51.000 --> 01:11:55.000
So by definition, these two vectors are orthogonal.

01:11:55.000 --> 01:12:01.000
So let's take a look at what they look like if we were to graph them.

01:12:01.000 --> 01:12:12.000
So u is negative three, so go over three up four, negative three four, so it's kind of a rough sketch.

01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:19.000
And then v is positive four and up three, so about there.

01:12:19.000 --> 01:12:27.000
And even though this is just a rough sketch, it seems pretty reasonable that these two vectors are orthogonal.

01:12:27.000 --> 01:12:30.000
That looks to be about 90 degrees in there.

01:12:30.000 --> 01:12:36.000
And we know for certain, because this dot product is zero, we know for certain that they are orthogonal.

01:12:36.000 --> 01:12:43.000
And just by the sketch, they, you know, that kind of confirms in our mind if we had any doubt that they are indeed orthogonal.

01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:48.000
Okay, so this is the definition of orthogonal. I'll see you in the next video.

01:12:48.000 --> 01:13:01.000
Okay, here we have a proof to do, we need to prove that the diagonals of a parallelogram are perpendicular if and only if the length of their sides are equal.

01:13:01.000 --> 01:13:13.000
Okay, so the first thing that I want to do is just get some intuition about what we're actually trying to prove and write a mathematical statement of what we're trying to prove.

01:13:13.000 --> 01:13:17.000
So kind of convert these words into math.

01:13:17.000 --> 01:13:21.000
The first thing I'm going to do is just draw a parallelogram to see what's going on.

01:13:21.000 --> 01:13:26.000
So here are two vectors, u and v, and we know we can make a parallelogram out of them.

01:13:26.000 --> 01:13:31.000
So here's, well, let me switch to a thinner brush.

01:13:31.000 --> 01:13:35.000
So here's u and here is v.

01:13:35.000 --> 01:13:40.000
And we know we can make a parallelogram out of them, so let's do that.

01:13:40.000 --> 01:13:50.000
Oh, and I should tell you that I made these vectors exactly equal in length because it says that we want them to be equal in length, so I wanted to see what was going on with that.

01:13:50.000 --> 01:14:05.000
And now we know how to create the diagonals, right? If we do head-to-tail addition, we can get this main diagonal and we know that that's u plus v.

01:14:05.000 --> 01:14:12.000
And then how do we get the other diagonal?

01:14:12.000 --> 01:14:27.000
Well, the other diagonal is just u minus v, so that is here, u minus v.

01:14:27.000 --> 01:14:38.000
We talked about that in vector subtraction. The vector pointing from the head of one vector to the head of the other is vector subtraction, essentially.

01:14:38.000 --> 01:14:43.000
Okay, so we have our two diagonals. Let's see if we can convert this statement into some math.

01:14:43.000 --> 01:14:55.000
So what we're trying to prove is that the diagonals, u plus v, are perpendicular, right?

01:14:55.000 --> 01:15:02.000
U plus v and u minus v, we're trying to prove that these are perpendicular.

01:15:02.000 --> 01:15:09.000
So we could say that their dot product is zero, so the diagonals are perpendicular.

01:15:09.000 --> 01:15:18.000
That's this statement, the diagonals are perpendicular. If and only if the length of their sides are equal.

01:15:18.000 --> 01:15:25.000
So this is length of u is equal to length of v.

01:15:25.000 --> 01:15:31.000
Okay, so now we have a proof and we need to go in both directions.

01:15:31.000 --> 01:15:48.000
So let's go forward first. Let's say assume that the dot product is zero.

01:15:48.000 --> 01:15:57.000
So assume that the diagonals are perpendicular or orthogonal.

01:15:57.000 --> 01:16:02.000
We're going to assume this and now we need to prove that the lengths are equal.

01:16:02.000 --> 01:16:08.000
Okay, well let's just see what happens through this equation if we expand it out.

01:16:08.000 --> 01:16:13.000
So that equation implies what is the dot product expanded here?

01:16:13.000 --> 01:16:35.000
So we're going to have u dot u, which we know is the length of u squared, minus u dot v plus v dot u.

01:16:35.000 --> 01:16:44.000
And then we're going to get minus the length of v squared because this is just minus v dot v.

01:16:44.000 --> 01:16:51.000
Okay, the dot product is commutative and so u dot v is the same thing as v dot u.

01:16:51.000 --> 01:16:57.000
So we have a minus v dot u dot v here and a plus u dot v, so those are going to cancel out.

01:16:57.000 --> 01:17:01.000
Oh, and I kind of made a mistake here, sorry about that.

01:17:01.000 --> 01:17:04.000
This is an implication.

01:17:04.000 --> 01:17:12.000
The fact that this is equal to zero implies that this statement is equal to zero because all we did was expand it out,

01:17:12.000 --> 01:17:18.000
which in turn, let me switch colors here, well maybe not, maybe I'll leave it where it was,

01:17:18.000 --> 01:17:28.000
which in turn implies that the length of u squared minus the length of v squared,

01:17:28.000 --> 01:17:32.000
oops I forgot my vector there, is equal to zero,

01:17:32.000 --> 01:17:43.000
which again implies that the length of u squared is equal to the length of v squared.

01:17:43.000 --> 01:17:48.000
Well, length of vectors are always positive and so we could take the square root

01:17:48.000 --> 01:17:55.000
and not really worry about messing up this equality because we're not going to need the negative part of the square root

01:17:55.000 --> 01:18:00.000
because we know both of these lengths are positive.

01:18:00.000 --> 01:18:06.000
So we take the square root of both sides and we get exactly what we wanted,

01:18:06.000 --> 01:18:13.000
that the length of u is equal to the length of v.

01:18:13.000 --> 01:18:20.000
Okay, so we proved that if the vectors, if the diagonals are perpendicular,

01:18:20.000 --> 01:18:23.000
then their lengths must be equal.

01:18:23.000 --> 01:18:34.000
Let's go ahead and prove that if the lengths are equal then the vectors must be perpendicular.

01:18:34.000 --> 01:18:45.000
So I'm just going to write this kind of backwards implies arrow just to indicate we're doing the other part of the proof now.

01:18:45.000 --> 01:18:57.000
So we're going to assume that the lengths are equal and what we want to get to is that the vectors are perpendicular,

01:18:57.000 --> 01:19:00.000
or the diagonals are perpendicular.

01:19:00.000 --> 01:19:02.000
So we're going to assume this.

01:19:02.000 --> 01:19:06.000
Now this doesn't seem, it seems like well where do we go from here?

01:19:06.000 --> 01:19:12.000
How do we construct a proof out of just this equality?

01:19:12.000 --> 01:19:28.000
Well what I would do is I would say, okay, consider the dot product of u plus v dotted with u minus v.

01:19:28.000 --> 01:19:30.000
So the dot product of the diagonals.

01:19:30.000 --> 01:19:34.000
Now we're not going to say that this is equal to zero, we can't do that.

01:19:34.000 --> 01:19:39.000
That's what we're trying to prove but we can just see what comes out when we take this dot product.

01:19:39.000 --> 01:19:45.000
We know that this dot product exists, we have two vectors, we can take their dot products.

01:19:45.000 --> 01:19:48.000
Okay, so let's do that.

01:19:48.000 --> 01:19:55.000
Well this is equal to, that dot product is equal to, well we already did this.

01:19:55.000 --> 01:20:07.000
It was the length of u squared minus the u dot v plus u dot v.

01:20:07.000 --> 01:20:13.000
I just commuted there, it would be v dot u but I just commuted the two vectors.

01:20:13.000 --> 01:20:19.000
And then minus the length of v squared.

01:20:19.000 --> 01:20:35.000
And this is equal to the length of u squared minus the length of v squared.

01:20:35.000 --> 01:20:41.000
Since u is equal to v we can substitute one and for the other and we know of course that this is equal to zero.

01:20:41.000 --> 01:20:47.000
So we took the dot product and we found out that yes the dot product is equal to zero.

01:20:47.000 --> 01:20:51.000
So that's it, we're done with our proof.

01:20:51.000 --> 01:20:54.000
We've proved that if the lengths are equal the dot product is zero.

01:20:54.000 --> 01:20:59.000
We've proved that if the dot product is zero then the lengths are equal.

01:20:59.000 --> 01:21:11.000
And again just one more time, when I say that the dot product is zero what I'm implying by definition is that these two vectors are perpendicular.

01:21:11.000 --> 01:21:17.000
And of course from the beginning of the video those two vectors represent the diagonals.

01:21:17.000 --> 01:21:21.000
Okay, so that's somewhat of an interesting proof.

01:21:21.000 --> 01:21:28.000
The diagonals of a parallelogram are only perpendicular if and only if the lengths of the sides are equal.

01:21:28.000 --> 01:21:30.000
Okay, see you in the next video.
