1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Let's start by asking the most basic question, what is a vector?

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,000
And a vector is really just two pieces of information.

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Direction and length, or what's also called magnitude.

4
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Two different words for the same thing.

5
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Now length is a very physical visual concept, right?

6
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
It's something we can see, it's something we can measure.

7
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:40,000
And the same with direction, it's our orientation, it's a very visual thing.

8
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:46,000
So vectors to begin with most intuitively fit on a graph.

9
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:51,000
They fit in a place where we can visualize them.

10
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:58,000
And so how could we attempt to capture direction and length?

11
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Well you know, I think an arrow does a pretty good job.

12
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:09,000
This for instance, for instance, captures direction, it's moving in the northeast direction,

13
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:14,000
and it also clearly has a certain length.

14
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:19,000
And so this is a vector, and that's exactly how we graph vectors.

15
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Just as arrows.

16
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:31,000
This is also a vector, it's pointing in a certain direction, it has a certain length, as is this.

17
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:35,000
So is this, this is a vector.

18
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Even though it doesn't start at the origin, it's clearly pointing in a certain direction,

19
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:43,000
so it has direction, and it clearly also has length.

20
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:48,000
So vectors need not start at the origin, they can start anywhere.

21
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:55,000
This is also a vector, it's pointing in a certain direction, and it has a certain length.

22
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Okay, that's great.

23
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Now let's look at a specific example.

24
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Here is a vector, and I want to first of all name that vector.

25
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:16,000
So I'm just going to call it V, and I'm going to put a little arrow over the top of it,

26
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,000
to make sure that we know that this is a vector.

27
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:30,000
So the vector V, and now I want to capture this information.

28
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:37,000
I want to capture the information that arrow is telling us, without needing to draw it.

29
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:44,000
So I'm not going to write this like this, I'm not going to say V is equal to this arrow, that's too ambiguous.

30
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:52,000
I need something more definite, something with more structure.

31
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Well, this vector moves over a certain amount in the x direction.

32
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Let's say for example, it moves over 3 in the x direction.

33
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:11,000
It also moves a certain amount up in the y direction.

34
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Let's say for example, it moves up 1.

35
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Well now I can say that this vector is equal to its components.

36
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,000
So that's a new word for us.

37
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:40,000
It's equal to its x component, which is 3, how much it moves over in x, and its y component, which is 1, which is how much it moves up in y.

38
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:58,000
So again, this is the x component and the y component.

39
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:06,000
And now anyone in the world looking at this vector, V equal to 3, 1, can go ahead and draw that vector if they want to.

40
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:13,000
They know exactly which vector we're talking about when we write that.

41
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Just a bit of notation here, this is also written as a column.

42
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:28,000
And it's the exact same information, it's just vertical now.

43
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:37,000
And again, this is still the x component and still the y component.

44
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Okay, let's look at another example.

45
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Let's look at, let's say the vector u.

46
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:58,000
And let's say it has the components negative 2, 3.

47
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Well that simply means we're moving over negative 2 in x and up 3 in y.

48
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:08,000
So maybe something right around here.

49
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:13,000
So this would be 3 in y and negative 2 in the x direction.

50
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:21,000
And there's our vector.

51
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Nothing to it.

52
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:40,000
And of course we could have written this as a column vector, negative 2, 3, if we wanted to.

53
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Okay, so we have that down.

54
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:54,000
But what about direction and length?

55
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Does this capture direction and length?

56
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:04,000
These just have, just using two components, how does that tell us direction and length?

57
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Well it tells us direction because this is the vector that moves over 3 in x and up 1 in y.

58
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,000
That's its direction, over 3 up 1.

59
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
It points in that direction.

60
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,000
But what about length?

61
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Well that's what we're going to talk about in the next video.

62
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:25,000
But I'll give you a clue.

63
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:30,000
We've formed a right triangle here.

64
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:37,000
The components tell us the length of the base and the length of the height of the triangle.

65
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:42,000
And what we're trying to find is this length here which is the hypotenuse of the right triangle.

66
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:49,000
So maybe you know some formula or theorem that tells you how to find the length of the hypotenuse of a right triangle.

67
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:54,000
And if you do then you can figure out the length of this vector.

68
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:59,000
And that's what we're going to do in the next video. See you then.

69
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Let's find the length of v equal to 3 1.

70
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,000
But before we do that let's just get some notation out of the way.

71
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:13,000
When we're talking about the length of a vector we write these double bars around it.

72
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Almost like a double absolute value around the vector.

73
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:23,000
And now this is read the length of v.

74
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:32,000
So going back to our vector v we have its x component is 3 and its y component is 1.

75
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:42,000
So that simply means we've moved over 3 in the x direction and up 1 in the y direction.

76
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:47,000
And now we've formed a right triangle.

77
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:58,000
And it turns out that the length of this vector is just the hypotenuse of this triangle.

78
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,000
And so we can just use the Pythagorean theorem.

79
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:11,000
The length of v squared is equal to the 3 squared, the base squared plus the height squared.

80
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:17,000
So 3 squared plus 1 squared.

81
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:26,000
This is directly a direct application of the Pythagorean theorem.

82
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:32,000
And so that implies if we just take the square root of both sides

83
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:52,000
that the length of v is equal to the square root of 3 squared plus 1 squared.

84
00:08:52,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Which simplifies to the square root of 10.

85
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,000
And it's really just as simple as that.

86
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:14,000
All we're doing when we're finding the length of a vector is finding the hypotenuse of a right triangle using the Pythagorean theorem.

87
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Okay, let's look at another example.

88
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Let's say we have something like u is equal to negative 2, 7.

89
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
So let's draw that.

90
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,000
We're going to move over by 2 and up by 7.

91
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:48,000
So something like that.

92
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:59,000
So we've moved over negative 2 and we've moved up by 7.

93
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
So maybe I'll erase that.

94
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:05,000
There we go.

95
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Okay, and now the length of u again is just given by the Pythagorean theorem.

96
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:17,000
And we can just skip right to the final step.

97
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:30,000
And this is just going to be equal to the square root of negative 2 squared plus 7 squared.

98
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Which turns out to be 53, the square root of 53.

99
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
And that's it.

100
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:45,000
It's as simple as that.

101
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Okay, let's do another example here.

102
00:10:49,000 --> 00:11:06,000
How about w is equal to 3 negative 2.

103
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Just making stuff up.

104
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Well, then the length of w is just going to be the square root of 3 squared plus negative 2 squared.

105
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:28,000
So we have 9 plus 4, so this is 13.

106
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:32,000
This is the square root of 13.

107
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
And we could graph that if we wanted to.

108
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:39,000
We're going to go over 3 down by 2, so it's going to look something like that.

109
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:43,000
And again, this is down 2 over 3.

110
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:50,000
We're just talking about the hypotenuse of a right triangle.

111
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Okay, so I hope this was helpful, and I'll see you in the next video.

112
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:59,000
Now that we have the basics of vectors down,

113
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:03,000
we should start asking things like what can we do with vectors?

114
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Can we add vectors, for example?

115
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:10,000
And the answer is yes, we can add vectors.

116
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:15,000
And let's see how we would do that.

117
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:20,000
So u plus v, or v plus u, I should say,

118
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:30,000
v plus u is simply going to be, we're going to take the two vectors and add them.

119
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:37,000
So I'm running out every step here.

120
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
And how do we do this?

121
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:43,000
Well, we just add their corresponding components together.

122
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:49,000
So the first component of v plus u is just going to be the first component of v,

123
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:55,000
which is 3, plus the first component of u.

124
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:59,000
And you can see, just visually, you can see what's happening here.

125
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:06,000
The second component of v plus u is just the second component of v plus the second component of u,

126
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:14,000
which in our case just becomes 4, 6.

127
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:18,000
So when we add vectors together, we get a new vector.

128
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:26,000
And here we got the vector 4, 6.

129
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Okay, so just to save some space, let me erase these steps here.

130
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:35,000
Move this over.

131
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:41,000
Okay, so let's now look at this on a graph.

132
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:48,000
Here is u and v, u and yellow, v and blue.

133
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:53,000
Real quick, because I haven't mentioned this yet, vectors have two things.

134
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:59,000
One is called a tail, it's starting point, and the other is called a head, it's ending point.

135
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:04,000
I mean, they have more than two things, I guess, but they have a head and a tail.

136
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:09,000
So when we add vectors, we line up their tails at a common point.

137
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:12,000
Here we pick the origin just because it's convenient.

138
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:15,000
So we line up their tails at that common point.

139
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:27,000
And then to add them, we just take, we're going along v and then we take u and place its tail to the head of v.

140
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:32,000
So you can see what this corresponds to, this is like going along u plus v.

141
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:38,000
Or sorry, going along v plus u.

142
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:47,000
And now the new vector is just the vector that starts at their common starting point and ends at that addition.

143
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:51,000
Sorry about that.

144
00:14:51,000 --> 00:15:01,000
So that new vector is the vector u, I'm sorry, v plus u.

145
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:08,000
And we know it has components four or six.

146
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:18,000
Which makes sense if we think about it, v took us over three in the x direction and u took us over one more, so that would be four.

147
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:30,000
So the new vector v plus u went over four and x and we could do a similar thing to show that it went up six and y.

148
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:44,000
Okay, what else? Well, notice that we could have, if we wanted to, have gone along u first and then added v.

149
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:50,000
And we would have got to the same point, which means we would have gotten the same vector.

150
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:57,000
So u plus v is the same vector as v plus u.

151
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:03,000
Which tells us that vector addition must be commutative.

152
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:09,000
Vector addition must be commutative.

153
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:21,000
And we'll prove that in a few videos from now.

154
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:28,000
We'll prove that vector addition is commutative, but just visually this is kind of a geometric proof that it must be.

155
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:35,000
Okay, that's vector addition. See you in the next video.

156
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:44,000
Can we multiply vectors by numbers? And the answer is yes.

157
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:48,000
So let's just see an example of that.

158
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:55,000
If we want to multiply v by two, so two v. I'll just write it like this, two v.

159
00:16:55,000 --> 00:17:04,000
Component wise, this is just two times this vector.

160
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:09,000
Which, we just take that two and we multiply each component by it.

161
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:14,000
So this becomes, I'll write out each step here.

162
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:24,000
This is two times one and then two times two, which of course simplifies to two four.

163
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:31,000
The vector two four.

164
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:36,000
And we call two, this number two, we call it a scalar multiple.

165
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:48,000
And there's a good reason we call it that, because what it does is it scales the vector.

166
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:54,000
And let me show you that. Here is our original vector, just v.

167
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:59,000
Here is two v. It's twice as large. In fact, let me put regular v back.

168
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:04,000
You can see there's v and when we multiply by two, it makes it twice as long.

169
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:15,000
It changes the length by two, by a factor of two.

170
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
Okay, there's nothing fancy about that.

171
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:22,000
We can also check out what happens when we take v and we multiply by a half.

172
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:26,000
It makes it half as big, half as long.

173
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:34,000
What I really want to talk about is what happens when we take v and we multiply it by negative one.

174
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:38,000
Well, then it flips the direction of v.

175
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:42,000
Now v is going in the opposite direction.

176
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:45,000
And what happens to the components?

177
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:50,000
Well, that's relatively easy to figure out.

178
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
Oops, I didn't need to erase those.

179
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:58,000
If we take negative one times v, which I'll just abbreviate as negative v.

180
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:07,000
This is negative one times one two, which simply turns out to be negative one, negative two.

181
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:11,000
And it flips the direction of v.

182
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
And why is that so important?

183
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:17,000
Well, now we can talk about vector subtraction.

184
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:26,000
We have a negative v here, and we know this works because we can multiply by that scalar of negative one.

185
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:29,000
And now we have a way to talk about vector subtraction.

186
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:33,000
So let's go ahead and do that. See you then.

187
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:36,000
Let's take a look at vector subtraction.

188
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:41,000
This is going to work the same way that it works for real numbers.

189
00:19:41,000 --> 00:20:00,000
If we want to do something like u minus v, this is really just the same thing as doing u plus negative v.

190
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:03,000
And we know how to multiply v by negative one.

191
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,000
That's simple enough.

192
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:21,000
We're going to have u, which is three three, plus a negative four, negative one.

193
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:25,000
Okay, simple enough.

194
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:33,000
We do that addition and we get four, or sorry, three plus negative four is negative one.

195
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:36,000
Three minus one is two.

196
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:42,000
And so this subtraction is just this new vector, negative one, two.

197
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:45,000
Simple enough.

198
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,000
So now let's take a look at that on a graph.

199
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:56,000
Here we have v in blue and u in orange.

200
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
And now we can graph negative v.

201
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:02,000
So it's just v, but pointing in the opposite direction.

202
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:05,000
So there's negative v.

203
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:11,000
And now to do this subtraction, we're really just doing u plus negative v.

204
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,000
So we're just going to take the head to tail approach.

205
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:19,000
We go up u and then we add negative v.

206
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:30,000
And we get to this new vector, u minus v.

207
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:33,000
There's our new vector.

208
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:38,000
But notice that vectors, since they're translational, we can move them anywhere in the plane.

209
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:43,000
We can draw u minus v here.

210
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
And close off that parallelogram.

211
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:49,000
This is the same vector as u minus v over there.

212
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,000
So this is still u minus v.

213
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:55,000
We just moved it over.

214
00:21:55,000 --> 00:22:06,000
And that's pretty interesting because that tells us that u minus v is the vector that points from the head of v to the head of u.

215
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
So make sure you see that.

216
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
Points from the head of v to the head of u.

217
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
In fact, let me remove that.

218
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:20,000
Maybe you can see it better.

219
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:26,000
Okay, so we're going to use that fact when we prove something about the dot product a few videos from now.

220
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:29,000
See that.

221
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:34,000
Okay, so here we have a vector with three components.

222
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:40,000
And now we can think of these as the x component and the y component just like before.

223
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:46,000
And now we're adding in the z component.

224
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,000
And so we have three components.

225
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:51,000
We need to graph this vector in three-dimensional space.

226
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:59,000
So we have these three axes here, the x axes, the y axis, and the z axis.

227
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:10,000
And to graph this, all we need to do is move over one and x and four and y.

228
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,000
So that takes us to about this point.

229
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:18,000
And I'm going to draw a line from the origin to that point where we've moved to.

230
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
So this is one and x, four and y.

231
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:27,000
And then we just need to move up three in the z direction.

232
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:30,000
And that will take us to our vector.

233
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:36,000
So our vector moves one and x, four and y, and three and z.

234
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:41,000
And there it is right there.

235
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:55,000
Now to help with a sense of depth, I find it helpful to dash these lines here.

236
00:23:55,000 --> 00:24:00,000
And now that dashed line is like the shadow of v onto the xy plane.

237
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:06,000
And then I also like to dash this line up for height.

238
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:13,000
I just think it gives us a better sense of depth and clarity.

239
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,000
Okay, and that's it.

240
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:18,000
There's really nothing more to graphing vectors in three dimensions.

241
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:21,000
I don't think you'll be asked to do that very often.

242
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:28,000
But vectors with three components behave exactly the same as vectors with three components.

243
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:33,000
Everything we learned for vectors with two components applies to vectors with three components,

244
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:42,000
including addition, subtraction, multiplying by scalar, the translational property of vectors, so on and so forth.

245
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:45,000
Okay, see you in the next video.

246
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:47,000
Oh, one thing real quick.

247
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:52,000
If you've never seen three-dimensional axes before, let me just explain that to you.

248
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:56,000
Why they look the way they do.

249
00:24:56,000 --> 00:25:00,000
It's as if our whole life when we've been looking at the xy plane,

250
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:07,000
it's as if we've been looking straight down the z axis.

251
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:12,000
Straight down the z axis.

252
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:18,000
So if we had an xy plane,

253
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:21,000
here's x and y,

254
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:24,000
z would be at the origin coming out straight at us.

255
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:29,000
And because it's coming out straight at us, we really, we can't see it.

256
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:35,000
If it were at even a slight angle, we would see it like this.

257
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:39,000
This would be z coming out at us.

258
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,000
And that's exactly what we have here.

259
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,000
We've just chosen to rotate things.

260
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:50,000
So you could see that the x kind of swings down and y swings down into its place and z rotates up.

261
00:25:50,000 --> 00:26:01,000
So things are rotated, but it's really, it should seem familiar in that sense once you realize what's going on.

262
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:05,000
Okay, anyways, I hope that was helpful. I'll see you in the next video.

263
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:11,000
Let's talk about finding the length of a vector that has three components.

264
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:17,000
So here we have the vector v equal to 1, 4, 3.

265
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:22,000
And I want to find its length.

266
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:26,000
In a previous video, we've graphed this vector.

267
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:34,000
And I want to point your attention to the fact that we have a right triangle here.

268
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:42,000
This dashed line and this dashed line form the base and the height of the triangle.

269
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:46,000
And the vector is the hypotenuse.

270
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:53,000
And I'll draw in a little square symbol so maybe you can see it better.

271
00:26:53,000 --> 00:27:03,000
There's a triangle there. It's a little bit at an angle to us, but it's definitely a right triangle sitting there.

272
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:10,000
Okay, so knowing that we can just apply the Pythagorean theorem.

273
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:25,000
And the length of v is simply the square root of the base of that triangle squared plus the height of the triangle squared.

274
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:31,000
So now all we have to do is figure out what is the base and what is the height of that triangle.

275
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:37,000
Well the height is easy. The height is how far we go up in z.

276
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:40,000
And we're just going up three units in z.

277
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:44,000
So the height is just simply three.

278
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:53,000
Okay, take care of that. This is b squared plus three squared.

279
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:58,000
Now what about b?

280
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:10,000
Well if you look closely you'll notice that there's another right triangle right here.

281
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:21,000
And that triangle, or what I should say is b is the hypotenuse of this triangle that I've filled in with yellow.

282
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:35,000
In fact let me pull that triangle out.

283
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:38,000
So this is the triangle I'm talking about.

284
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:43,000
b is the hypotenuse.

285
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:47,000
Once again for clarity, this is the triangle that I've pulled out.

286
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:50,000
It's this triangle here.

287
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:53,000
Okay well what are the sides of this triangle?

288
00:28:53,000 --> 00:29:00,000
We know that we moved over one there and four here.

289
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:04,000
So we can just apply the Pythagorean theorem again.

290
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:19,000
And we can say that b now is equal to one squared, the square root of one squared plus four squared.

291
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:23,000
That's what b is.

292
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:34,000
Well now that we have a term for b, let's go ahead and plug that in.

293
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:44,000
So we have b which is the square root of one squared plus four squared.

294
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:49,000
And now b is being squared.

295
00:29:49,000 --> 00:30:01,000
And then plus three squared.

296
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:03,000
Well something really nice just happened.

297
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:06,000
Look at, we have a square root being squared.

298
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:11,000
And so that square root just simply goes away.

299
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:20,000
So this whole thing simplifies to the square root of one squared plus four squared

300
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:30,000
because that square root went away plus three squared.

301
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:35,000
Now compare that to the components of v.

302
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:47,000
You'll see that the length of v is simply the square root of the sum of the squares of the components.

303
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:51,000
And that's kind of a lot of words to say all at once.

304
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:58,000
But we just take each component, we square it, we add them together and we take the square root.

305
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:03,000
Okay let's do another example.

306
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:20,000
Let's say we have u is equal to, I don't know one, negative six, four.

307
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:25,000
What is the length of u?

308
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:29,000
Well we don't need to go through the whole process that we went through.

309
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:37,000
Just remember, as long as we understand what we did we can just remember that the end result is just going to be,

310
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:45,000
we take each component, we square it, we add them all together and we take the square root.

311
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:50,000
So simply the square root of one squared plus negative six squared plus four squared.

312
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:53,000
And that's it.

313
00:31:53,000 --> 00:32:02,000
If you want we can do another example.

314
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:12,000
How about negative three zero nine?

315
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:30,000
So the length of w is equal to, what am I doing?

316
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:39,000
It's equal to the square root of negative three squared plus zero squared plus nine squared.

317
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:44,000
And there you have it. There's the length of a vector with three components.

318
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:50,000
If you're wondering what happens, if you have more than three components, let me show you that quickly.

319
00:32:50,000 --> 00:33:07,000
And I might make a separate video about this, but let's say we had something like v is equal to v1, v2, v3, and v4.

320
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:12,000
So now we have four components.

321
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:24,000
The length of v, you might be able to guess what it's going to be,

322
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:40,000
the square root of v1 squared plus v2 squared plus v3 squared plus v4 squared.

323
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:43,000
And if you had five components, you'd do the same thing.

324
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:47,000
You'd just add, tack that fifth one on at the end.

325
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:51,000
If you had six, you would do the same thing, just tack those on.

326
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:57,000
So that's the vector length for vectors with more than two components.

327
00:33:57,000 --> 00:34:02,000
Okay, see you in the next video.

328
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:06,000
Okay, here we have three vectors, v, u, and w.

329
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:11,000
And so far we've looked at vectors with two components,

330
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:20,000
and when we were graphing them or thinking about them visually, we thought about them in the plane, in two dimensions.

331
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:29,000
When we had a vector with three components, we graphed this in three dimensions.

332
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:49,000
And in fact, we even labeled this as the x, y, and z component corresponding to the x, y, and z axes.

333
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:59,000
When we go to higher dimensions, dimensions greater than three,

334
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:04,000
so here we have a vector w with n dimensions.

335
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:09,000
Let's say, for example, that n is four.

336
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:12,000
So this vector has four components.

337
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:16,000
Now we don't try and graph this anymore.

338
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:22,000
Anytime a vector has more than three components, we really can't graph it.

339
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:23,000
We can't visualize it.

340
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:29,000
We don't have a good way to graph four or five or six dimensions.

341
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:33,000
But the beauty of linear algebra and the power of linear algebra

342
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:41,000
is the fact that we can take what we know from here and from here, for that matter,

343
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:52,000
and we can push those concepts to higher dimensions to four dimensions, five dimensions, a hundred dimensions, a thousand dimensions.

344
00:35:52,000 --> 00:36:04,000
You know, we don't have to graph things, but the tools that we've created will still apply.

345
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:07,000
Okay.

346
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:13,000
So let's talk about some technical details here.

347
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:19,000
One is the fact that vectors are ordered lists of numbers.

348
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:21,000
They're ordered lists of components, right?

349
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:26,000
First, this vector has the component v1 and then it has v2.

350
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:31,000
We already talked about the order, how the order matters.

351
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:41,000
Well, that means that v is what's called a two-tuple.

352
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:46,000
And a tuple is nothing more than an ordered list of elements.

353
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:52,000
v is an ordered list of real numbers, an ordered list of components.

354
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,000
So v is a two-tuple.

355
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:58,000
It's a two-tuple because there's two of them.

356
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:03,000
Just like u is a three-tuple, it's an ordered list of three components.

357
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:08,000
And w is an n-tuple.

358
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:16,000
It's an ordered list of n-components.

359
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,000
Okay.

360
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:27,000
Now we have the tools for talking about the definition of rn.

361
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:39,000
And rn is really just the set of all n-tuples of real numbers.

362
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:49,000
So, for example, if you have a vector with two components,

363
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:57,000
that is an element of r2.

364
00:37:57,000 --> 00:38:02,000
Because r2 is the set of all two-tuples.

365
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:09,000
Well, v is just one of those two-tuples.

366
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:12,000
So v must be in r2.

367
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:16,000
And r2, we can loosely think of it as this plane.

368
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:19,000
I mean, we haven't defined what a dimension is,

369
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:22,000
but we can think of it as the two-dimensional plane.

370
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:27,000
So this is r2.

371
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:34,000
Just like u is an element of r3.

372
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:39,000
r3 is all three-tuples of real numbers.

373
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:44,000
And u just happens to be one of those three-tuples of real numbers.

374
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:47,000
So u is in r3.

375
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:52,000
And r3 we can think of as the three dimensions.

376
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:55,000
And again, we haven't formally defined dimension,

377
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:58,000
but we can think of it like that.

378
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:09,000
w, similar to the rest, is an element of rn.

379
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:15,000
rn is the set of all n-tuples of real numbers.

380
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:18,000
w is an n-tuple of real numbers.

381
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:22,000
So it's in rn.

382
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:28,000
w is an element of rn.

383
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:31,000
Okay, so I know this is a lot all at once,

384
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:35,000
but really what's important here is this notation.

385
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:37,000
To me, that's what's important.

386
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:39,000
This is going to come up all the time.

387
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:42,000
We're going to use it throughout the rest of the course.

388
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,000
And if it helps you remember,

389
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,000
just remember that the number up here

390
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:51,000
is going to be the same as the number of components.

391
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:55,000
So we can read this if we want.

392
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:57,000
Instead of v is an element of r2,

393
00:39:57,000 --> 00:40:02,000
we could just read this as v is a vector with two components.

394
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,000
u is a vector with three components.

395
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:09,000
w is a vector with n components.

396
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:11,000
Okay, so I just wanted to lay this out there

397
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:13,000
so that we're all on the same page,

398
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:14,000
and we'll move from here.

399
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,000
See you then.

400
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:24,000
Oh, also, we'll expand upon this idea of w,

401
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,000
or sorry, of a vector in rn,

402
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,000
how we can work with that

403
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:32,000
and abstract some of the ideas

404
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:35,000
that we learned in two and three dimensions.

405
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:39,000
Okay, see you then.

406
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:43,000
Okay, so here we've seen the length of a vector

407
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:46,000
with two components.

408
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,000
In fact, we just used the Pythagorean theorem

409
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:50,000
to figure out this length.

410
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:53,000
It's just the square root of the first component squared

411
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:57,000
plus the second component squared.

412
00:40:57,000 --> 00:41:00,000
In three dimensions, in a vector with three components,

413
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,000
we derived this length

414
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:05,000
using the Pythagorean theorem twice in a row,

415
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:07,000
and you can go back and watch that video if you want,

416
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:11,000
and we found the length of a vector in r3

417
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:15,000
is just the square root of u1 squared plus u2 squared

418
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:18,000
plus u3 squared.

419
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:23,000
A vector in rn, the length is defined to be as follows.

420
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:37,000
This is just equal to the square root of w1 squared

421
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:42,000
plus w2 squared plus everything in between,

422
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:46,000
so w3 squared plus w4 squared, so on,

423
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:53,000
all the way up till you get to the last component.

424
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:56,000
So it's really you just take each component individually,

425
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:59,000
you square it, you add all those together,

426
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:01,000
and then you take the square root.

427
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:04,000
That's how you find the length of any vector.

428
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:12,000
Okay, just figured I would fill you in on that.

429
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:15,000
See you in the next video.

430
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:17,000
Here we're being asked to prove that vector addition

431
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:20,000
is commutative and associative,

432
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:25,000
so this will be our first proof in the linear algebra course.

433
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:30,000
First of all, let's just define three vectors,

434
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:33,000
u, v, and w are all in rn,

435
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:36,000
so they're three vectors with n components,

436
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:40,000
and let's figure out what we're trying to prove.

437
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:43,000
So we're trying to prove that vector addition is commutative,

438
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:46,000
so u plus v is the same as v plus u,

439
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:51,000
and associative, so u plus v in parentheses plus w

440
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:55,000
is the same as u plus v plus w.

441
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:58,000
Okay, so how are we going to do this?

442
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:01,000
Excuse me.

443
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:11,000
First of all, let's just start with u plus v.

444
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:16,000
So here's u plus v.

445
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:19,000
And what is this equal to?

446
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:22,000
So what's the definition of vector addition?

447
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:24,000
Well, we've already gone over this.

448
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:34,000
It's u1 plus v1 comma u2 plus v2,

449
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:37,000
and that keeps going until you get to the last component,

450
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:44,000
un plus vn, and this is the new vector.

451
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:49,000
This is the vector u plus v.

452
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:55,000
Okay, well, remember, these are real numbers.

453
00:43:55,000 --> 00:44:01,000
The components of vectors in rn are real numbers,

454
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:05,000
and so we can use the commutative property of addition

455
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:10,000
of real numbers to switch those around.

456
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:15,000
So this is the same as v1 plus u1

457
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:17,000
because those are just real numbers,

458
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:21,000
and addition of real numbers is commutative.

459
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:27,000
v2 plus u2, and you keep going until you get to the end,

460
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:33,000
vn plus un.

461
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:43,000
Well, now here, this is the definition of v plus u.

462
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:48,000
That's how we define v plus u.

463
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:52,000
And so we have a simple algebraic proof here

464
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:55,000
that u plus v is equal to v plus u.

465
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:58,000
It's not really formal, there's no formal writings,

466
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:04,000
but I think you can see clearly it's a proof.

467
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:13,000
Okay, how about proving that vector addition is associative?

468
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:16,000
Well, I want you to pause and try that on your own,

469
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:18,000
but the strategy is going to be the same.

470
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:22,000
What we did is we went ahead and used the properties of real numbers,

471
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:25,000
the fact that real numbers are commutative,

472
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:27,000
to prove that vectors are commutative.

473
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:30,000
And we're going to use that same strategy for associative,

474
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:33,000
for the associative property.

475
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:41,000
Okay, pause and try that on your own.

476
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:43,000
Okay, hopefully you're back from pausing the video

477
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:46,000
and trying to prove that vectors are associative.

478
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:49,000
And now let's go through it.

479
00:45:49,000 --> 00:46:03,000
So we have u plus v plus w.

480
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:09,000
Well, we know that u plus v is going to be its own vector.

481
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:14,000
It's going to be the vector u1 plus v1.

482
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:17,000
And I'm just going to leave off the second component.

483
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:19,000
We all, you've seen it enough times.

484
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:21,000
We know what's happening.

485
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:26,000
Down to u n plus v n.

486
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:32,000
So that's this whole vector here.

487
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:42,000
We can think of u plus v as its own new vector, plus w.

488
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:46,000
And again, I'm going to leave off the second one

489
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:53,000
and just write it like that.

490
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:58,000
Okay, well, now we're just adding two vectors together.

491
00:46:58,000 --> 00:46:59,000
And we know how to do that.

492
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:02,000
We take the first component of the first vector,

493
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:05,000
which is u1 plus v1.

494
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:08,000
That's the first component of that vector.

495
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:11,000
And then we add the first component of the other vector,

496
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:14,000
which is just w1.

497
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:20,000
And we do that for each component, each of the components,

498
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:30,000
until we get to u n plus v n plus w n.

499
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:37,000
Okay, and now, again, we have real numbers here

500
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:40,000
and real numbers are associative.

501
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:42,000
Addition of real numbers is associative.

502
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:48,000
And so we're just going to use that property of real numbers.

503
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:58,000
So this is the same thing as u1 plus v1 plus w1.

504
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:00,000
Remember, these components are just real numbers,

505
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:05,000
so the associative property of addition holds.

506
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:20,000
Okay, and we'll do that all the way through all of these components.

507
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:25,000
And we're almost done.

508
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:34,000
And now we can break this up into the vector u.

509
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:52,000
u1 all the way to u n plus the vector v1 plus w1

510
00:48:52,000 --> 00:49:01,000
all the way to the end, the n plus w n.

511
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:14,000
And this, of course, is just u plus v plus w.

512
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:23,000
And so we've proved that vector addition is associative.

513
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:31,000
So again, it's a really simple method.

514
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:34,000
All we're doing is a really simple process.

515
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:36,000
That's the word I was looking for.

516
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:39,000
All we're doing is taking the vectors,

517
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:41,000
breaking them down into their components.

518
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:44,000
And since the components are real numbers,

519
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:48,000
we can use the properties of real numbers on the component level.

520
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:52,000
And then we're kind of pulling things back out into vectors.

521
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:54,000
Okay, I hope this was helpful.

522
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:58,000
We'll see the rest of the properties of vectors in the next video.

523
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:00,000
See you then.

524
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:05,000
Okay, here are some of the algebraic properties of vectors.

525
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:08,000
I encourage you to try and prove all of these.

526
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:11,000
We just proved that vector addition is commutative,

527
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:13,000
so that's number one here.

528
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:15,000
We just proved that in the last video.

529
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:17,000
Very similarly to the way we proved that,

530
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:21,000
you could prove all of these if you know properties of real numbers.

531
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:26,000
You know addition for real numbers is associative,

532
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:28,000
and that's what we have here in step number two,

533
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:31,000
so you probably can prove that pretty easily.

534
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:34,000
When you add a real number to zero,

535
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:37,000
you get that real number back.

536
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:40,000
So you can go through all of these pretty easily.

537
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:47,000
And like I said, just use the properties of real numbers that you know.

538
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:53,000
One interesting thing here is we have this thing called the zero vector.

539
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:56,000
And the zero vector is a little bit different than zero.

540
00:50:56,000 --> 00:51:00,000
It's a vector whose components are all zero.

541
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:03,000
And that distinction is somewhat important

542
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:08,000
because we can't add just a regular number zero to a vector.

543
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:11,000
We have to add a vector to a vector.

544
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:14,000
So when we do this addition, we need this to be a zero vector,

545
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:18,000
so we can add each of the components together.

546
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:20,000
But okay, so this is just for reference.

547
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:22,000
You can view it at any time.

548
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:25,000
I hope they'll have a reference sheet on the website

549
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:27,000
that you can look at and print off.

550
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:32,000
So we can use these from now on with vectors.

551
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:34,000
See you in the next video.

552
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:37,000
So if you've been following along so far,

553
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:41,000
you may have noticed that we haven't talked about multiplying two vectors.

554
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:47,000
And that's because there's a couple different ways to multiply vectors

555
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:50,000
or to define a product of vectors.

556
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:53,000
And one really interesting and useful one is called the dot product.

557
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:57,000
So when you see this dot here that indicates the dot product,

558
00:51:57,000 --> 00:52:02,000
and the way the dot product is defined is maybe somewhat surprising.

559
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:10,000
The way that we do this is we do u1 times v1 plus u2 times v2.

560
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:14,000
Plus u3 times v3, so on and so on.

561
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:22,000
All the way until we get to the end, un plus un times vn.

562
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:24,000
Why is that surprising?

563
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:28,000
Why is that a surprising way to define a product of two vectors?

564
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:30,000
Well, look at the result.

565
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:33,000
What kind of object is this?

566
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:35,000
It's a number.

567
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:37,000
These two things are numbers.

568
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:40,000
When we multiply them, we just get a real number plus another real number.

569
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:42,000
All the way across.

570
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:45,000
When we add all these up, that's just a single number.

571
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:48,000
So you multiply two vectors and you just get a number out.

572
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:53,000
So you don't even get a vector back when you multiply two vectors with a dot product.

573
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:58,000
So this is sometimes called the scalar product for that reason that the result is a scalar.

574
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:00,000
It's a real number, a constant.

575
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:04,000
Those are all different ways of saying the same thing.

576
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:09,000
So for slightly different notation and maybe a little bit more concise notation,

577
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:19,000
is we could use summation notation or sigma notation and just write this like this.

578
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:26,000
So we sum up all the components from one to n, the products of those components.

579
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:31,000
So if you're comfortable and familiar with sigma notation, this is one way to write it.

580
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:37,000
I personally actually prefer this way up here because it's a little bit more informative, I think.

581
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:42,000
It's a little bit easier to see just right away without interpreting the sigma notation.

582
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:45,000
Anyways, that's that.

583
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:49,000
Let's do an example.

584
00:53:49,000 --> 00:54:15,000
So if we have u is equal to 1, negative 2, and 5, and v is equal to 4, 3, and 1.

585
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:18,000
So what is this dot product?

586
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:20,000
Well, we just do exactly what it says.

587
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:30,000
1 times 4 plus negative 2 times 3 plus 5 times 1.

588
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:35,000
So we get 4 minus 6 plus 5.

589
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:40,000
That looks like 3 to me.

590
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:51,000
So maybe what I should have written was this is u minus v, or sorry, u dot v.

591
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:54,000
u dot v is equal to this.

592
00:54:54,000 --> 00:55:00,000
We're taking u1 times v1 plus u2 times v2 plus u3 times vt, v3.

593
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:06,000
And then we're just simplifying the numbers and it comes out to 3.

594
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:14,000
So this maybe seems a little bit bizarre, but we'll see in the coming videos why this dot product is really useful.

595
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:16,000
See you then.

596
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:20,000
Let's look at some interesting consequences of the dot product.

597
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:28,000
And the first one that I want to look at is the consequence it has for the definition of the length of a vector.

598
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:38,000
It turns out that because the way the dot product is defined, we can think of the length of the vector as the square root of the vector dotted with itself.

599
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:41,000
And why does that make any sense?

600
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:53,000
Well, if we think about what this is equal to, this dot product here is just u1 times u1, which is u1 squared, plus u2 times u2,

601
00:55:53,000 --> 00:56:00,000
which is u2 squared, plus all the way up to un times un, so un squared.

602
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:02,000
So that just comes from the definition of a dot product.

603
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:06,000
We take each of the components, we multiply them together, and we add them up.

604
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:10,000
And we already said that this is how we are going to define the length of a vector.

605
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:16,000
Remember, we did this in two dimensions where we used the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of a vector.

606
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:20,000
In more dimensions, we just keep adding the squares of the components.

607
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:25,000
If we have any more components we have, we square them and we add them underneath the square root.

608
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:33,000
So that's the length of a vector, and so it makes sense that the square root of u dot u is the length of the vector.

609
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:48,000
Also notice that, you know, this is a pretty natural follow up, but the length of a vector squared, that means, is equal to the vector dotted with itself.

610
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:52,000
So we just squared both sides of this.

611
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:58,000
Okay, that's pretty cool.

612
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:00,000
What else?

613
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:12,000
Well, the more interesting thing that happens is it has to do with the angle between two vectors.

614
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:21,000
So let's say this is u, and this is v, and this is theta.

615
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:27,000
Well, what if we did u minus v? We already talked about what u minus v is.

616
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:31,000
It's the vector that points from v to u.

617
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:39,000
Now, we've drawn a triangle here. What we can do is we can use the law of cosines to help us figure out this angle in here,

618
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:44,000
or to help us figure out this side, u minus v.

619
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:52,000
So the law of cosines tells us that the length of the side we're trying to find, u minus v,

620
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:59,000
so this is going all the way back to your geometry class, and you can look up the law of cosines if you don't remember it,

621
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:07,000
but that length squared is equal to the length of one of the sides, that's u,

622
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:21,000
the length of u squared plus the length of v squared minus the length of u times the length of v.

623
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:27,000
So I know that these length symbols get really tedious, but I'm just going to keep going with them here.

624
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:33,000
So minus the length of u times the length of v times the cosine of the angle between them.

625
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:41,000
So this comes from the law of cosines. It's really just saying c squared is equal to a squared plus b squared minus ab cos theta.

626
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:47,000
You might remember it better that way, but that's what we have. We have a side u minus v and a side u and a side v.

627
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:52,000
So what we're going to do now is we're going to examine this side.

628
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:56,000
So let's pull that side out and look at it separately.

629
00:58:56,000 --> 00:59:06,000
So we have the length of u minus v squared, well that's just u minus v dotted with u minus v, so let's do that.

630
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:12,000
u minus v dotted with itself.

631
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:22,000
And now there's some properties of dot products that I haven't told you about that are going to become useful here,

632
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:26,000
like commutativity, but we'll see that in action.

633
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:32,000
So u dot u, well we just talked about that, that's the length of u squared, so let's write that as that.

634
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:40,000
u dot u is the length of u squared.

635
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:50,000
And then we have u dot, oh I have dot products in there, sorry that's a mistake, this should be u minus v, u minus v.

636
00:59:50,000 --> 01:00:06,000
So u dotted with minus v, that's minus, so let me write that on the side, minus u v, well minus u dot v.

637
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:16,000
And then we have minus v dot u, so that's minus v dot u, but like I just said the dot product is commutative,

638
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:23,000
so this becomes, when we add those two together we just get minus two u dot v.

639
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:26,000
So I hope that was relatively clear.

640
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:32,000
We're just foiling this out with the dot product.

641
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:42,000
So based on what we just talked about that's minus two times u dot v.

642
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:52,000
So just to be explicit, really explicit here, that was this u coming over here and this v coming this way.

643
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:59,000
So I had to pause the video because my phone was ringing, but yeah like I was saying this, u comes and multiplies that v,

644
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:04,000
this v comes and multiplies that u, so we get minus two u dot v.

645
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:15,000
And then finally the v dotted with itself, well it's both negative so that's going to be plus the length of v squared.

646
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:19,000
This is just v dot v, turns out to be.

647
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:22,000
So this is what the left hand side of the equation becomes.

648
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:32,000
So why don't we substitute that into this, the law of cosines essentially, what we have.

649
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:52,000
So this is u squared, the length of u squared, minus two u dot v, plus the length of v squared, is equal to the length of u squared.

650
01:01:52,000 --> 01:02:00,000
So this is now the right hand side of the equation from up there, plus the length of v squared,

651
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:10,000
minus the length of u times the length of v times the cosine of the angle between them.

652
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:17,000
Okay so now we get to do a lot of canceling here, so let's see.

653
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:22,000
This and this are going to go away, we can subtract those from both sides, those are going to go away.

654
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:25,000
Oh jeez I did something terribly wrong here.

655
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:29,000
This is not the law of cosines, we need a minus two.

656
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:32,000
That means we need a minus two down here.

657
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:38,000
And then we can divide the minus two on both sides though, so that's pretty cool.

658
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:40,000
So sorry for forgetting that for the whole video.

659
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:44,000
And what do we end up with after we do all that crazy cancellation?

660
01:02:44,000 --> 01:03:04,000
Well we just end up with u dot v on this side is equal to the length of u times the length of v times the cosine of the angle between them.

661
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:13,000
And now that is really cool because as long as we're given the vectors u and v, we could figure out what u dot v is based on the definition,

662
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:20,000
sum up the products of the components, and then we can figure out the lengths, we know how to do that,

663
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:25,000
we just take the square root of the sum of the square of the components,

664
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:29,000
and then we have this cosine of theta so we can solve for theta,

665
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:34,000
and we can figure out the angle between two vectors just knowing what the two vectors are.

666
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:35,000
So that's really cool.

667
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:49,000
So in fact, remember that this proof came from the law of cosines which only really works in two dimensions, we're talking about a triangle.

668
01:03:49,000 --> 01:04:14,000
So when we go to higher dimensions we take it as a definition that the cosine of theta is equal to u dot v divided by the length of u times the length of v.

669
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:18,000
So that just comes because we just divided by length of u, length of v.

670
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:22,000
So notice two things happen here.

671
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:30,000
One, we have an alternate definition for the dot product or an alternate way to express the dot product.

672
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:38,000
And also now we have a way to express the angle between two vectors in terms of the dot product.

673
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:40,000
And that's really cool.

674
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:41,000
So I hope this helps.

675
01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:43,000
I'll see you in the next video.

676
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:48,000
Let's use what we know about the dot product to find the angle between these two vectors.

677
01:04:48,000 --> 01:05:12,000
So what we're going to do is remember our little formula which says that the cosine of the angle between two vectors is equal to u dot v divided by the length of u times the length of v.

678
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:17,000
So if we want to find the angle between two vectors we have to do just a few computations.

679
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:25,000
We have to find the dot product and then we have to find the length of each vector.

680
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:28,000
So let's go through that.

681
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:50,000
So the dot product of u and v, so u dot v, u dot v is equal to two times one, that's two, plus one times one, that's one, plus negative two times one, that's just negative two or minus two.

682
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:56,000
So this comes out to be one.

683
01:05:56,000 --> 01:06:00,000
So the dot product is one, let's do the length of u now in the length of v.

684
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:12,000
So the length of u is equal to the square root of two squared plus one squared plus negative two squared.

685
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:19,000
So two squared is four, plus one squared is one, plus negative two squared is four, so plus four.

686
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:26,000
So this is the square root of nine if we add those together and the square root of nine is just three.

687
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:30,000
And now let's do the length of v.

688
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:38,000
So all we're doing is just doing the necessary computations based on this formula and we derived this formula in the last video.

689
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:41,000
So if you're curious about that go back and watch that.

690
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:47,000
So now we have one squared, well that's just one, plus one squared, well that's one, plus one squared, that's one.

691
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:52,000
So this is the square root of three.

692
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:58,000
So we have our necessary pieces here, so let's put them all together.

693
01:06:58,000 --> 01:07:09,000
So we have the cosine of the angle between the two vectors is equal to the dot product of the two vectors, which we found was equal to one,

694
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:16,000
divided by the length of u, that's three times the length of v, that's the square root of three.

695
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:35,000
So this is the cosine of the angle, so to find the angle theta is just equal to the arc cos or the inverse cos of one divided by three times the square root of three.

696
01:07:35,000 --> 01:07:42,000
And now to find this we would have to use a calculator or a table of values.

697
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:49,000
And so I'll spare us the pain, but you should maybe do that on your calculator just to make sure you get the right answer.

698
01:07:49,000 --> 01:08:00,000
And this comes out to 1.37 radians, or I should write this is approximately equal, rounding a little bit or truncating.

699
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:15,000
So this is approximately equal to 1.37 radians, and if your calculator is in degree mode, then that's approximately 78.9 degrees.

700
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:18,000
Okay, so nothing too terribly difficult.

701
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:24,000
We just got to compute the dot product, compute the length of the vectors, and everything falls into place.

702
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:27,000
Okay, see you in the next video.

703
01:08:27,000 --> 01:08:33,000
In the last video we learned the definition of the cosine between two vectors.

704
01:08:33,000 --> 01:08:42,000
In fact, we pretty much derived this, so we said the cosine of the angle between two vectors is u dot v divided by the length of u times the length of v.

705
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:50,000
So let's see what we can determine about two vectors when they're perpendicular.

706
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:56,000
So if two vectors are perpendicular, what we say is they're orthogonal.

707
01:08:56,000 --> 01:09:00,000
So that's the word we use for perpendicular vectors.

708
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:02,000
And let's see what we can determine.

709
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:04,000
So u and v here.

710
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:11,000
So this angle, of course, is pi over 2, or 90 degrees.

711
01:09:11,000 --> 01:09:13,000
And what does that mean?

712
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:29,000
Well, by our definition of the angle between two vectors, that means that the cosine of pi over 2 is equal to this dot product.

713
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:33,000
And while I'm writing this, think about what is the cosine of pi over 2?

714
01:09:33,000 --> 01:09:35,000
What is that equal to?

715
01:09:35,000 --> 01:09:41,000
We know what it is, it's just a number, right?

716
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:45,000
Well, the cosine of pi over 2 is zero.

717
01:09:45,000 --> 01:09:51,000
So all three of these things are equal, and they're all equal to zero.

718
01:09:51,000 --> 01:09:54,000
Excuse me.

719
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:56,000
So what does that tell us?

720
01:09:56,000 --> 01:10:03,000
Well, that tells us that u dot v must be equal to zero.

721
01:10:03,000 --> 01:10:09,000
So this implies that u dot v is equal to zero.

722
01:10:09,000 --> 01:10:14,000
And that's because the denominator here will never make this fraction zero.

723
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:20,000
Okay, so if the vectors are orthogonal, then the dot product is zero.

724
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:22,000
And in fact, that works in the other direction.

725
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:26,000
If the dot product is zero, the vectors are orthogonal.

726
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:29,000
So now we have a definition of orthogonal.

727
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:32,000
Two vectors are orthogonal.

728
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:40,000
So two, well, let me write this, two vectors u and v are orthogonal if and only if.

729
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:45,000
If you've never seen this before, this is shorthand notation for if and only if.

730
01:10:45,000 --> 01:10:56,000
Two vectors are u and v are orthogonal if and only if u dot v is equal to zero.

731
01:10:56,000 --> 01:11:01,000
So now we have a nice, easy way to test if two vectors are orthogonal.

732
01:11:01,000 --> 01:11:06,000
So let's take a look at that.

733
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:12,000
So let's take some two easy vectors with just two components and see what happens.

734
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:28,000
So let's say u is equal to negative three, four, and v is equal to four, three.

735
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:32,000
So let's do their dot product really quickly.

736
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:45,000
u dot v is equal to negative three times four, negative three times four, plus four times three.

737
01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:51,000
Well, it's pretty clear this is negative 12 plus 12, so that's zero.

738
01:11:51,000 --> 01:11:55,000
So by definition, these two vectors are orthogonal.

739
01:11:55,000 --> 01:12:01,000
So let's take a look at what they look like if we were to graph them.

740
01:12:01,000 --> 01:12:12,000
So u is negative three, so go over three up four, negative three four, so it's kind of a rough sketch.

741
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:19,000
And then v is positive four and up three, so about there.

742
01:12:19,000 --> 01:12:27,000
And even though this is just a rough sketch, it seems pretty reasonable that these two vectors are orthogonal.

743
01:12:27,000 --> 01:12:30,000
That looks to be about 90 degrees in there.

744
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:36,000
And we know for certain, because this dot product is zero, we know for certain that they are orthogonal.

745
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:43,000
And just by the sketch, they, you know, that kind of confirms in our mind if we had any doubt that they are indeed orthogonal.

746
01:12:43,000 --> 01:12:48,000
Okay, so this is the definition of orthogonal. I'll see you in the next video.

747
01:12:48,000 --> 01:13:01,000
Okay, here we have a proof to do, we need to prove that the diagonals of a parallelogram are perpendicular if and only if the length of their sides are equal.

748
01:13:01,000 --> 01:13:13,000
Okay, so the first thing that I want to do is just get some intuition about what we're actually trying to prove and write a mathematical statement of what we're trying to prove.

749
01:13:13,000 --> 01:13:17,000
So kind of convert these words into math.

750
01:13:17,000 --> 01:13:21,000
The first thing I'm going to do is just draw a parallelogram to see what's going on.

751
01:13:21,000 --> 01:13:26,000
So here are two vectors, u and v, and we know we can make a parallelogram out of them.

752
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:31,000
So here's, well, let me switch to a thinner brush.

753
01:13:31,000 --> 01:13:35,000
So here's u and here is v.

754
01:13:35,000 --> 01:13:40,000
And we know we can make a parallelogram out of them, so let's do that.

755
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:50,000
Oh, and I should tell you that I made these vectors exactly equal in length because it says that we want them to be equal in length, so I wanted to see what was going on with that.

756
01:13:50,000 --> 01:14:05,000
And now we know how to create the diagonals, right? If we do head-to-tail addition, we can get this main diagonal and we know that that's u plus v.

757
01:14:05,000 --> 01:14:12,000
And then how do we get the other diagonal?

758
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:27,000
Well, the other diagonal is just u minus v, so that is here, u minus v.

759
01:14:27,000 --> 01:14:38,000
We talked about that in vector subtraction. The vector pointing from the head of one vector to the head of the other is vector subtraction, essentially.

760
01:14:38,000 --> 01:14:43,000
Okay, so we have our two diagonals. Let's see if we can convert this statement into some math.

761
01:14:43,000 --> 01:14:55,000
So what we're trying to prove is that the diagonals, u plus v, are perpendicular, right?

762
01:14:55,000 --> 01:15:02,000
U plus v and u minus v, we're trying to prove that these are perpendicular.

763
01:15:02,000 --> 01:15:09,000
So we could say that their dot product is zero, so the diagonals are perpendicular.

764
01:15:09,000 --> 01:15:18,000
That's this statement, the diagonals are perpendicular. If and only if the length of their sides are equal.

765
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:25,000
So this is length of u is equal to length of v.

766
01:15:25,000 --> 01:15:31,000
Okay, so now we have a proof and we need to go in both directions.

767
01:15:31,000 --> 01:15:48,000
So let's go forward first. Let's say assume that the dot product is zero.

768
01:15:48,000 --> 01:15:57,000
So assume that the diagonals are perpendicular or orthogonal.

769
01:15:57,000 --> 01:16:02,000
We're going to assume this and now we need to prove that the lengths are equal.

770
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:08,000
Okay, well let's just see what happens through this equation if we expand it out.

771
01:16:08,000 --> 01:16:13,000
So that equation implies what is the dot product expanded here?

772
01:16:13,000 --> 01:16:35,000
So we're going to have u dot u, which we know is the length of u squared, minus u dot v plus v dot u.

773
01:16:35,000 --> 01:16:44,000
And then we're going to get minus the length of v squared because this is just minus v dot v.

774
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:51,000
Okay, the dot product is commutative and so u dot v is the same thing as v dot u.

775
01:16:51,000 --> 01:16:57,000
So we have a minus v dot u dot v here and a plus u dot v, so those are going to cancel out.

776
01:16:57,000 --> 01:17:01,000
Oh, and I kind of made a mistake here, sorry about that.

777
01:17:01,000 --> 01:17:04,000
This is an implication.

778
01:17:04,000 --> 01:17:12,000
The fact that this is equal to zero implies that this statement is equal to zero because all we did was expand it out,

779
01:17:12,000 --> 01:17:18,000
which in turn, let me switch colors here, well maybe not, maybe I'll leave it where it was,

780
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:28,000
which in turn implies that the length of u squared minus the length of v squared,

781
01:17:28,000 --> 01:17:32,000
oops I forgot my vector there, is equal to zero,

782
01:17:32,000 --> 01:17:43,000
which again implies that the length of u squared is equal to the length of v squared.

783
01:17:43,000 --> 01:17:48,000
Well, length of vectors are always positive and so we could take the square root

784
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:55,000
and not really worry about messing up this equality because we're not going to need the negative part of the square root

785
01:17:55,000 --> 01:18:00,000
because we know both of these lengths are positive.

786
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:06,000
So we take the square root of both sides and we get exactly what we wanted,

787
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:13,000
that the length of u is equal to the length of v.

788
01:18:13,000 --> 01:18:20,000
Okay, so we proved that if the vectors, if the diagonals are perpendicular,

789
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:23,000
then their lengths must be equal.

790
01:18:23,000 --> 01:18:34,000
Let's go ahead and prove that if the lengths are equal then the vectors must be perpendicular.

791
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:45,000
So I'm just going to write this kind of backwards implies arrow just to indicate we're doing the other part of the proof now.

792
01:18:45,000 --> 01:18:57,000
So we're going to assume that the lengths are equal and what we want to get to is that the vectors are perpendicular,

793
01:18:57,000 --> 01:19:00,000
or the diagonals are perpendicular.

794
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:02,000
So we're going to assume this.

795
01:19:02,000 --> 01:19:06,000
Now this doesn't seem, it seems like well where do we go from here?

796
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:12,000
How do we construct a proof out of just this equality?

797
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:28,000
Well what I would do is I would say, okay, consider the dot product of u plus v dotted with u minus v.

798
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:30,000
So the dot product of the diagonals.

799
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:34,000
Now we're not going to say that this is equal to zero, we can't do that.

800
01:19:34,000 --> 01:19:39,000
That's what we're trying to prove but we can just see what comes out when we take this dot product.

801
01:19:39,000 --> 01:19:45,000
We know that this dot product exists, we have two vectors, we can take their dot products.

802
01:19:45,000 --> 01:19:48,000
Okay, so let's do that.

803
01:19:48,000 --> 01:19:55,000
Well this is equal to, that dot product is equal to, well we already did this.

804
01:19:55,000 --> 01:20:07,000
It was the length of u squared minus the u dot v plus u dot v.

805
01:20:07,000 --> 01:20:13,000
I just commuted there, it would be v dot u but I just commuted the two vectors.

806
01:20:13,000 --> 01:20:19,000
And then minus the length of v squared.

807
01:20:19,000 --> 01:20:35,000
And this is equal to the length of u squared minus the length of v squared.

808
01:20:35,000 --> 01:20:41,000
Since u is equal to v we can substitute one and for the other and we know of course that this is equal to zero.

809
01:20:41,000 --> 01:20:47,000
So we took the dot product and we found out that yes the dot product is equal to zero.

810
01:20:47,000 --> 01:20:51,000
So that's it, we're done with our proof.

811
01:20:51,000 --> 01:20:54,000
We've proved that if the lengths are equal the dot product is zero.

812
01:20:54,000 --> 01:20:59,000
We've proved that if the dot product is zero then the lengths are equal.

813
01:20:59,000 --> 01:21:11,000
And again just one more time, when I say that the dot product is zero what I'm implying by definition is that these two vectors are perpendicular.

814
01:21:11,000 --> 01:21:17,000
And of course from the beginning of the video those two vectors represent the diagonals.

815
01:21:17,000 --> 01:21:21,000
Okay, so that's somewhat of an interesting proof.

816
01:21:21,000 --> 01:21:28,000
The diagonals of a parallelogram are only perpendicular if and only if the lengths of the sides are equal.

817
01:21:28,000 --> 01:21:30,000
Okay, see you in the next video.
