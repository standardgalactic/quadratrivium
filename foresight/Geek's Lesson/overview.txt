1. The inner product (also known as the dot product) of a vector with itself, denoted as u · u, gives a measure of its length squared. Mathematically, it is the sum of the squares of its components. This value is always non-negative, and it equals zero if and only if the vector is the zero vector.

2. The norm (or length) of a vector can be computed using the formula ||v|| = sqrt(v1^2 + v2^2 + ... + vn^2), where v1, v2, ..., vn are the components of the vector v. This is known as the Euclidean norm or the 2-norm for vectors in two dimensions, and it generalizes to higher dimensions as well.

3. The distance between two vectors u and v can be found by subtracting one vector from another (u - v) and then taking the length of the resulting vector: dist(u, v) = ||u - v||.

4. Two vectors are considered orthogonal if their inner product is zero. This means that when you multiply each component of one vector by the corresponding component of the other and sum these products, the result should be zero.

5. An orthogonal set is a collection of vectors where any two vectors from the set have an inner product of zero. To verify that a set of vectors is orthogonal, compute the inner product of each pair of vectors in the set and ensure all results are zero.

1. We started by assuming two vectors (u and v) are perpendicular and proved that if they are perpendicular, then their lengths must be equal. This was done by expanding the dot product of u + v with itself, which resulted in (length of u)^2 - 2(u · v) + (length of v)^2 being equal to zero. Since the dot product u · v is zero for perpendicular vectors, we can conclude that (length of u)^2 = (length of v)^2 implies the lengths are equal.

2. We then aimed to prove the converse: if the lengths of vectors u and v are equal, then they must be perpendicular. To do this, we considered the dot product of u + v with itself. This dot product simplifies to (length of u)^2 - 2(u · v) + (length of v)^2, which we know is zero because the lengths are equal. By expanding and simplifying this expression, we showed that the dot product u · v must be zero, which implies that the vectors are perpendicular.

In conclusion, we have proven that the diagonals of a parallelogram are perpendicular if and only if the lengths of the sides (the diagonals themselves) are equal. This is a fundamental property of parallelograms in Euclidean geometry.
