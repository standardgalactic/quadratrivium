0	6000	Let's start by asking the most basic question, what is a vector?
6000	12000	And a vector is really just two pieces of information.
12000	19000	Direction and length, or what's also called magnitude.
19000	24000	Two different words for the same thing.
24000	30000	Now length is a very physical visual concept, right?
30000	33000	It's something we can see, it's something we can measure.
33000	40000	And the same with direction, it's our orientation, it's a very visual thing.
40000	46000	So vectors to begin with most intuitively fit on a graph.
46000	51000	They fit in a place where we can visualize them.
51000	58000	And so how could we attempt to capture direction and length?
58000	64000	Well you know, I think an arrow does a pretty good job.
64000	69000	This for instance, for instance, captures direction, it's moving in the northeast direction,
69000	74000	and it also clearly has a certain length.
74000	79000	And so this is a vector, and that's exactly how we graph vectors.
79000	83000	Just as arrows.
83000	91000	This is also a vector, it's pointing in a certain direction, it has a certain length, as is this.
91000	95000	So is this, this is a vector.
95000	99000	Even though it doesn't start at the origin, it's clearly pointing in a certain direction,
99000	103000	so it has direction, and it clearly also has length.
103000	108000	So vectors need not start at the origin, they can start anywhere.
108000	115000	This is also a vector, it's pointing in a certain direction, and it has a certain length.
115000	118000	Okay, that's great.
118000	123000	Now let's look at a specific example.
123000	130000	Here is a vector, and I want to first of all name that vector.
130000	136000	So I'm just going to call it V, and I'm going to put a little arrow over the top of it,
136000	140000	to make sure that we know that this is a vector.
140000	150000	So the vector V, and now I want to capture this information.
150000	157000	I want to capture the information that arrow is telling us, without needing to draw it.
157000	164000	So I'm not going to write this like this, I'm not going to say V is equal to this arrow, that's too ambiguous.
164000	172000	I need something more definite, something with more structure.
172000	179000	Well, this vector moves over a certain amount in the x direction.
179000	184000	Let's say for example, it moves over 3 in the x direction.
184000	191000	It also moves a certain amount up in the y direction.
191000	196000	Let's say for example, it moves up 1.
196000	202000	Well now I can say that this vector is equal to its components.
202000	205000	So that's a new word for us.
205000	220000	It's equal to its x component, which is 3, how much it moves over in x, and its y component, which is 1, which is how much it moves up in y.
220000	238000	So again, this is the x component and the y component.
238000	246000	And now anyone in the world looking at this vector, V equal to 3, 1, can go ahead and draw that vector if they want to.
246000	253000	They know exactly which vector we're talking about when we write that.
253000	264000	Just a bit of notation here, this is also written as a column.
264000	268000	And it's the exact same information, it's just vertical now.
268000	277000	And again, this is still the x component and still the y component.
277000	279000	Okay, let's look at another example.
279000	287000	Let's look at, let's say the vector u.
287000	298000	And let's say it has the components negative 2, 3.
298000	303000	Well that simply means we're moving over negative 2 in x and up 3 in y.
303000	308000	So maybe something right around here.
308000	313000	So this would be 3 in y and negative 2 in the x direction.
313000	321000	And there's our vector.
321000	324000	Nothing to it.
324000	340000	And of course we could have written this as a column vector, negative 2, 3, if we wanted to.
340000	346000	Okay, so we have that down.
346000	354000	But what about direction and length?
354000	357000	Does this capture direction and length?
357000	364000	These just have, just using two components, how does that tell us direction and length?
364000	370000	Well it tells us direction because this is the vector that moves over 3 in x and up 1 in y.
370000	373000	That's its direction, over 3 up 1.
373000	375000	It points in that direction.
375000	378000	But what about length?
378000	381000	Well that's what we're going to talk about in the next video.
381000	385000	But I'll give you a clue.
385000	390000	We've formed a right triangle here.
390000	397000	The components tell us the length of the base and the length of the height of the triangle.
397000	402000	And what we're trying to find is this length here which is the hypotenuse of the right triangle.
402000	409000	So maybe you know some formula or theorem that tells you how to find the length of the hypotenuse of a right triangle.
409000	414000	And if you do then you can figure out the length of this vector.
414000	419000	And that's what we're going to do in the next video. See you then.
419000	424000	Let's find the length of v equal to 3 1.
424000	427000	But before we do that let's just get some notation out of the way.
427000	433000	When we're talking about the length of a vector we write these double bars around it.
433000	438000	Almost like a double absolute value around the vector.
438000	443000	And now this is read the length of v.
444000	452000	So going back to our vector v we have its x component is 3 and its y component is 1.
452000	462000	So that simply means we've moved over 3 in the x direction and up 1 in the y direction.
462000	467000	And now we've formed a right triangle.
467000	478000	And it turns out that the length of this vector is just the hypotenuse of this triangle.
478000	481000	And so we can just use the Pythagorean theorem.
481000	491000	The length of v squared is equal to the 3 squared, the base squared plus the height squared.
491000	497000	So 3 squared plus 1 squared.
497000	506000	This is directly a direct application of the Pythagorean theorem.
506000	512000	And so that implies if we just take the square root of both sides
512000	532000	that the length of v is equal to the square root of 3 squared plus 1 squared.
532000	540000	Which simplifies to the square root of 10.
540000	543000	And it's really just as simple as that.
543000	554000	All we're doing when we're finding the length of a vector is finding the hypotenuse of a right triangle using the Pythagorean theorem.
554000	561000	Okay, let's look at another example.
561000	581000	Let's say we have something like u is equal to negative 2, 7.
581000	582000	So let's draw that.
582000	585000	We're going to move over by 2 and up by 7.
585000	588000	So something like that.
588000	599000	So we've moved over negative 2 and we've moved up by 7.
599000	601000	So maybe I'll erase that.
601000	605000	There we go.
605000	610000	Okay, and now the length of u again is just given by the Pythagorean theorem.
610000	617000	And we can just skip right to the final step.
617000	630000	And this is just going to be equal to the square root of negative 2 squared plus 7 squared.
630000	638000	Which turns out to be 53, the square root of 53.
638000	639000	And that's it.
639000	645000	It's as simple as that.
645000	649000	Okay, let's do another example here.
649000	666000	How about w is equal to 3 negative 2.
666000	668000	Just making stuff up.
668000	685000	Well, then the length of w is just going to be the square root of 3 squared plus negative 2 squared.
685000	688000	So we have 9 plus 4, so this is 13.
688000	692000	This is the square root of 13.
692000	694000	And we could graph that if we wanted to.
694000	699000	We're going to go over 3 down by 2, so it's going to look something like that.
699000	703000	And again, this is down 2 over 3.
703000	710000	We're just talking about the hypotenuse of a right triangle.
710000	716000	Okay, so I hope this was helpful, and I'll see you in the next video.
716000	719000	Now that we have the basics of vectors down,
719000	723000	we should start asking things like what can we do with vectors?
723000	727000	Can we add vectors, for example?
727000	730000	And the answer is yes, we can add vectors.
730000	735000	And let's see how we would do that.
735000	740000	So u plus v, or v plus u, I should say,
740000	750000	v plus u is simply going to be, we're going to take the two vectors and add them.
750000	757000	So I'm running out every step here.
757000	759000	And how do we do this?
759000	763000	Well, we just add their corresponding components together.
763000	769000	So the first component of v plus u is just going to be the first component of v,
769000	775000	which is 3, plus the first component of u.
775000	779000	And you can see, just visually, you can see what's happening here.
779000	786000	The second component of v plus u is just the second component of v plus the second component of u,
786000	794000	which in our case just becomes 4, 6.
794000	798000	So when we add vectors together, we get a new vector.
798000	806000	And here we got the vector 4, 6.
806000	811000	Okay, so just to save some space, let me erase these steps here.
811000	815000	Move this over.
815000	821000	Okay, so let's now look at this on a graph.
821000	828000	Here is u and v, u and yellow, v and blue.
828000	833000	Real quick, because I haven't mentioned this yet, vectors have two things.
833000	839000	One is called a tail, it's starting point, and the other is called a head, it's ending point.
839000	844000	I mean, they have more than two things, I guess, but they have a head and a tail.
844000	849000	So when we add vectors, we line up their tails at a common point.
849000	852000	Here we pick the origin just because it's convenient.
852000	855000	So we line up their tails at that common point.
855000	867000	And then to add them, we just take, we're going along v and then we take u and place its tail to the head of v.
867000	872000	So you can see what this corresponds to, this is like going along u plus v.
872000	878000	Or sorry, going along v plus u.
878000	887000	And now the new vector is just the vector that starts at their common starting point and ends at that addition.
887000	891000	Sorry about that.
891000	901000	So that new vector is the vector u, I'm sorry, v plus u.
901000	908000	And we know it has components four or six.
908000	918000	Which makes sense if we think about it, v took us over three in the x direction and u took us over one more, so that would be four.
918000	930000	So the new vector v plus u went over four and x and we could do a similar thing to show that it went up six and y.
931000	944000	Okay, what else? Well, notice that we could have, if we wanted to, have gone along u first and then added v.
944000	950000	And we would have got to the same point, which means we would have gotten the same vector.
950000	957000	So u plus v is the same vector as v plus u.
957000	963000	Which tells us that vector addition must be commutative.
963000	969000	Vector addition must be commutative.
969000	981000	And we'll prove that in a few videos from now.
981000	988000	We'll prove that vector addition is commutative, but just visually this is kind of a geometric proof that it must be.
988000	995000	Okay, that's vector addition. See you in the next video.
999000	1004000	Can we multiply vectors by numbers? And the answer is yes.
1004000	1008000	So let's just see an example of that.
1008000	1015000	If we want to multiply v by two, so two v. I'll just write it like this, two v.
1015000	1024000	Component wise, this is just two times this vector.
1024000	1029000	Which, we just take that two and we multiply each component by it.
1029000	1034000	So this becomes, I'll write out each step here.
1034000	1044000	This is two times one and then two times two, which of course simplifies to two four.
1044000	1051000	The vector two four.
1051000	1056000	And we call two, this number two, we call it a scalar multiple.
1056000	1068000	And there's a good reason we call it that, because what it does is it scales the vector.
1068000	1074000	And let me show you that. Here is our original vector, just v.
1074000	1079000	Here is two v. It's twice as large. In fact, let me put regular v back.
1079000	1084000	You can see there's v and when we multiply by two, it makes it twice as long.
1084000	1095000	It changes the length by two, by a factor of two.
1095000	1097000	Okay, there's nothing fancy about that.
1097000	1102000	We can also check out what happens when we take v and we multiply by a half.
1102000	1106000	It makes it half as big, half as long.
1106000	1114000	What I really want to talk about is what happens when we take v and we multiply it by negative one.
1114000	1118000	Well, then it flips the direction of v.
1118000	1122000	Now v is going in the opposite direction.
1122000	1125000	And what happens to the components?
1125000	1130000	Well, that's relatively easy to figure out.
1130000	1132000	Oops, I didn't need to erase those.
1132000	1138000	If we take negative one times v, which I'll just abbreviate as negative v.
1138000	1147000	This is negative one times one two, which simply turns out to be negative one, negative two.
1147000	1151000	And it flips the direction of v.
1151000	1153000	And why is that so important?
1153000	1157000	Well, now we can talk about vector subtraction.
1157000	1166000	We have a negative v here, and we know this works because we can multiply by that scalar of negative one.
1166000	1169000	And now we have a way to talk about vector subtraction.
1169000	1173000	So let's go ahead and do that. See you then.
1173000	1176000	Let's take a look at vector subtraction.
1176000	1181000	This is going to work the same way that it works for real numbers.
1181000	1200000	If we want to do something like u minus v, this is really just the same thing as doing u plus negative v.
1200000	1203000	And we know how to multiply v by negative one.
1203000	1205000	That's simple enough.
1205000	1221000	We're going to have u, which is three three, plus a negative four, negative one.
1221000	1225000	Okay, simple enough.
1225000	1233000	We do that addition and we get four, or sorry, three plus negative four is negative one.
1233000	1236000	Three minus one is two.
1236000	1242000	And so this subtraction is just this new vector, negative one, two.
1242000	1245000	Simple enough.
1245000	1247000	So now let's take a look at that on a graph.
1247000	1256000	Here we have v in blue and u in orange.
1256000	1258000	And now we can graph negative v.
1258000	1262000	So it's just v, but pointing in the opposite direction.
1262000	1265000	So there's negative v.
1265000	1271000	And now to do this subtraction, we're really just doing u plus negative v.
1271000	1273000	So we're just going to take the head to tail approach.
1273000	1279000	We go up u and then we add negative v.
1279000	1290000	And we get to this new vector, u minus v.
1290000	1293000	There's our new vector.
1293000	1298000	But notice that vectors, since they're translational, we can move them anywhere in the plane.
1298000	1303000	We can draw u minus v here.
1303000	1305000	And close off that parallelogram.
1305000	1309000	This is the same vector as u minus v over there.
1309000	1311000	So this is still u minus v.
1311000	1315000	We just moved it over.
1315000	1326000	And that's pretty interesting because that tells us that u minus v is the vector that points from the head of v to the head of u.
1326000	1328000	So make sure you see that.
1328000	1330000	Points from the head of v to the head of u.
1330000	1332000	In fact, let me remove that.
1332000	1340000	Maybe you can see it better.
1340000	1346000	Okay, so we're going to use that fact when we prove something about the dot product a few videos from now.
1346000	1349000	See that.
1349000	1354000	Okay, so here we have a vector with three components.
1354000	1360000	And now we can think of these as the x component and the y component just like before.
1360000	1366000	And now we're adding in the z component.
1366000	1368000	And so we have three components.
1368000	1371000	We need to graph this vector in three-dimensional space.
1371000	1379000	So we have these three axes here, the x axes, the y axis, and the z axis.
1379000	1390000	And to graph this, all we need to do is move over one and x and four and y.
1390000	1392000	So that takes us to about this point.
1392000	1398000	And I'm going to draw a line from the origin to that point where we've moved to.
1398000	1400000	So this is one and x, four and y.
1400000	1407000	And then we just need to move up three in the z direction.
1407000	1410000	And that will take us to our vector.
1410000	1416000	So our vector moves one and x, four and y, and three and z.
1416000	1421000	And there it is right there.
1421000	1435000	Now to help with a sense of depth, I find it helpful to dash these lines here.
1435000	1440000	And now that dashed line is like the shadow of v onto the xy plane.
1440000	1446000	And then I also like to dash this line up for height.
1446000	1453000	I just think it gives us a better sense of depth and clarity.
1453000	1455000	Okay, and that's it.
1455000	1458000	There's really nothing more to graphing vectors in three dimensions.
1458000	1461000	I don't think you'll be asked to do that very often.
1461000	1468000	But vectors with three components behave exactly the same as vectors with three components.
1468000	1473000	Everything we learned for vectors with two components applies to vectors with three components,
1473000	1482000	including addition, subtraction, multiplying by scalar, the translational property of vectors, so on and so forth.
1482000	1485000	Okay, see you in the next video.
1485000	1487000	Oh, one thing real quick.
1487000	1492000	If you've never seen three-dimensional axes before, let me just explain that to you.
1492000	1496000	Why they look the way they do.
1496000	1500000	It's as if our whole life when we've been looking at the xy plane,
1500000	1507000	it's as if we've been looking straight down the z axis.
1507000	1512000	Straight down the z axis.
1512000	1518000	So if we had an xy plane,
1518000	1521000	here's x and y,
1521000	1524000	z would be at the origin coming out straight at us.
1524000	1529000	And because it's coming out straight at us, we really, we can't see it.
1529000	1535000	If it were at even a slight angle, we would see it like this.
1535000	1539000	This would be z coming out at us.
1539000	1541000	And that's exactly what we have here.
1541000	1543000	We've just chosen to rotate things.
1543000	1550000	So you could see that the x kind of swings down and y swings down into its place and z rotates up.
1550000	1561000	So things are rotated, but it's really, it should seem familiar in that sense once you realize what's going on.
1561000	1565000	Okay, anyways, I hope that was helpful. I'll see you in the next video.
1565000	1571000	Let's talk about finding the length of a vector that has three components.
1571000	1577000	So here we have the vector v equal to 1, 4, 3.
1577000	1582000	And I want to find its length.
1582000	1586000	In a previous video, we've graphed this vector.
1586000	1594000	And I want to point your attention to the fact that we have a right triangle here.
1594000	1602000	This dashed line and this dashed line form the base and the height of the triangle.
1602000	1606000	And the vector is the hypotenuse.
1606000	1613000	And I'll draw in a little square symbol so maybe you can see it better.
1613000	1623000	There's a triangle there. It's a little bit at an angle to us, but it's definitely a right triangle sitting there.
1623000	1630000	Okay, so knowing that we can just apply the Pythagorean theorem.
1630000	1645000	And the length of v is simply the square root of the base of that triangle squared plus the height of the triangle squared.
1645000	1651000	So now all we have to do is figure out what is the base and what is the height of that triangle.
1651000	1657000	Well the height is easy. The height is how far we go up in z.
1657000	1660000	And we're just going up three units in z.
1660000	1664000	So the height is just simply three.
1664000	1673000	Okay, take care of that. This is b squared plus three squared.
1673000	1678000	Now what about b?
1678000	1690000	Well if you look closely you'll notice that there's another right triangle right here.
1690000	1701000	And that triangle, or what I should say is b is the hypotenuse of this triangle that I've filled in with yellow.
1701000	1715000	In fact let me pull that triangle out.
1715000	1718000	So this is the triangle I'm talking about.
1718000	1723000	b is the hypotenuse.
1723000	1727000	Once again for clarity, this is the triangle that I've pulled out.
1727000	1730000	It's this triangle here.
1730000	1733000	Okay well what are the sides of this triangle?
1733000	1740000	We know that we moved over one there and four here.
1740000	1744000	So we can just apply the Pythagorean theorem again.
1744000	1759000	And we can say that b now is equal to one squared, the square root of one squared plus four squared.
1759000	1763000	That's what b is.
1763000	1774000	Well now that we have a term for b, let's go ahead and plug that in.
1774000	1784000	So we have b which is the square root of one squared plus four squared.
1784000	1789000	And now b is being squared.
1789000	1801000	And then plus three squared.
1801000	1803000	Well something really nice just happened.
1803000	1806000	Look at, we have a square root being squared.
1806000	1811000	And so that square root just simply goes away.
1811000	1820000	So this whole thing simplifies to the square root of one squared plus four squared
1820000	1830000	because that square root went away plus three squared.
1830000	1835000	Now compare that to the components of v.
1835000	1847000	You'll see that the length of v is simply the square root of the sum of the squares of the components.
1847000	1851000	And that's kind of a lot of words to say all at once.
1851000	1858000	But we just take each component, we square it, we add them together and we take the square root.
1858000	1863000	Okay let's do another example.
1863000	1880000	Let's say we have u is equal to, I don't know one, negative six, four.
1880000	1885000	What is the length of u?
1885000	1889000	Well we don't need to go through the whole process that we went through.
1889000	1897000	Just remember, as long as we understand what we did we can just remember that the end result is just going to be,
1897000	1905000	we take each component, we square it, we add them all together and we take the square root.
1905000	1910000	So simply the square root of one squared plus negative six squared plus four squared.
1910000	1913000	And that's it.
1913000	1922000	If you want we can do another example.
1922000	1932000	How about negative three zero nine?
1932000	1950000	So the length of w is equal to, what am I doing?
1950000	1959000	It's equal to the square root of negative three squared plus zero squared plus nine squared.
1959000	1964000	And there you have it. There's the length of a vector with three components.
1964000	1970000	If you're wondering what happens, if you have more than three components, let me show you that quickly.
1970000	1987000	And I might make a separate video about this, but let's say we had something like v is equal to v1, v2, v3, and v4.
1987000	1992000	So now we have four components.
1992000	2004000	The length of v, you might be able to guess what it's going to be,
2004000	2020000	the square root of v1 squared plus v2 squared plus v3 squared plus v4 squared.
2020000	2023000	And if you had five components, you'd do the same thing.
2023000	2027000	You'd just add, tack that fifth one on at the end.
2027000	2031000	If you had six, you would do the same thing, just tack those on.
2031000	2037000	So that's the vector length for vectors with more than two components.
2037000	2042000	Okay, see you in the next video.
2042000	2046000	Okay, here we have three vectors, v, u, and w.
2046000	2051000	And so far we've looked at vectors with two components,
2051000	2060000	and when we were graphing them or thinking about them visually, we thought about them in the plane, in two dimensions.
2061000	2069000	When we had a vector with three components, we graphed this in three dimensions.
2069000	2089000	And in fact, we even labeled this as the x, y, and z component corresponding to the x, y, and z axes.
2090000	2099000	When we go to higher dimensions, dimensions greater than three,
2099000	2104000	so here we have a vector w with n dimensions.
2104000	2109000	Let's say, for example, that n is four.
2109000	2112000	So this vector has four components.
2112000	2116000	Now we don't try and graph this anymore.
2116000	2122000	Anytime a vector has more than three components, we really can't graph it.
2122000	2123000	We can't visualize it.
2123000	2129000	We don't have a good way to graph four or five or six dimensions.
2129000	2133000	But the beauty of linear algebra and the power of linear algebra
2133000	2141000	is the fact that we can take what we know from here and from here, for that matter,
2141000	2152000	and we can push those concepts to higher dimensions to four dimensions, five dimensions, a hundred dimensions, a thousand dimensions.
2152000	2164000	You know, we don't have to graph things, but the tools that we've created will still apply.
2164000	2167000	Okay.
2167000	2173000	So let's talk about some technical details here.
2173000	2179000	One is the fact that vectors are ordered lists of numbers.
2179000	2181000	They're ordered lists of components, right?
2181000	2186000	First, this vector has the component v1 and then it has v2.
2186000	2191000	We already talked about the order, how the order matters.
2191000	2201000	Well, that means that v is what's called a two-tuple.
2201000	2206000	And a tuple is nothing more than an ordered list of elements.
2206000	2212000	v is an ordered list of real numbers, an ordered list of components.
2212000	2214000	So v is a two-tuple.
2214000	2218000	It's a two-tuple because there's two of them.
2218000	2223000	Just like u is a three-tuple, it's an ordered list of three components.
2223000	2228000	And w is an n-tuple.
2228000	2236000	It's an ordered list of n-components.
2236000	2238000	Okay.
2238000	2247000	Now we have the tools for talking about the definition of rn.
2247000	2259000	And rn is really just the set of all n-tuples of real numbers.
2259000	2269000	So, for example, if you have a vector with two components,
2269000	2277000	that is an element of r2.
2277000	2282000	Because r2 is the set of all two-tuples.
2282000	2289000	Well, v is just one of those two-tuples.
2289000	2292000	So v must be in r2.
2292000	2296000	And r2, we can loosely think of it as this plane.
2296000	2299000	I mean, we haven't defined what a dimension is,
2299000	2302000	but we can think of it as the two-dimensional plane.
2302000	2307000	So this is r2.
2307000	2314000	Just like u is an element of r3.
2314000	2319000	r3 is all three-tuples of real numbers.
2319000	2324000	And u just happens to be one of those three-tuples of real numbers.
2324000	2327000	So u is in r3.
2327000	2332000	And r3 we can think of as the three dimensions.
2332000	2335000	And again, we haven't formally defined dimension,
2335000	2338000	but we can think of it like that.
2338000	2349000	w, similar to the rest, is an element of rn.
2349000	2355000	rn is the set of all n-tuples of real numbers.
2355000	2358000	w is an n-tuple of real numbers.
2358000	2362000	So it's in rn.
2362000	2368000	w is an element of rn.
2368000	2371000	Okay, so I know this is a lot all at once,
2371000	2375000	but really what's important here is this notation.
2375000	2377000	To me, that's what's important.
2377000	2379000	This is going to come up all the time.
2379000	2382000	We're going to use it throughout the rest of the course.
2382000	2384000	And if it helps you remember,
2384000	2386000	just remember that the number up here
2386000	2391000	is going to be the same as the number of components.
2391000	2395000	So we can read this if we want.
2395000	2397000	Instead of v is an element of r2,
2397000	2402000	we could just read this as v is a vector with two components.
2402000	2404000	u is a vector with three components.
2404000	2409000	w is a vector with n components.
2409000	2411000	Okay, so I just wanted to lay this out there
2411000	2413000	so that we're all on the same page,
2413000	2414000	and we'll move from here.
2414000	2416000	See you then.
2416000	2424000	Oh, also, we'll expand upon this idea of w,
2424000	2426000	or sorry, of a vector in rn,
2426000	2428000	how we can work with that
2428000	2432000	and abstract some of the ideas
2432000	2435000	that we learned in two and three dimensions.
2435000	2439000	Okay, see you then.
2439000	2443000	Okay, so here we've seen the length of a vector
2443000	2446000	with two components.
2446000	2448000	In fact, we just used the Pythagorean theorem
2448000	2450000	to figure out this length.
2450000	2453000	It's just the square root of the first component squared
2453000	2457000	plus the second component squared.
2457000	2460000	In three dimensions, in a vector with three components,
2460000	2462000	we derived this length
2462000	2465000	using the Pythagorean theorem twice in a row,
2465000	2467000	and you can go back and watch that video if you want,
2467000	2471000	and we found the length of a vector in r3
2471000	2475000	is just the square root of u1 squared plus u2 squared
2475000	2478000	plus u3 squared.
2478000	2483000	A vector in rn, the length is defined to be as follows.
2490000	2497000	This is just equal to the square root of w1 squared
2497000	2502000	plus w2 squared plus everything in between,
2502000	2506000	so w3 squared plus w4 squared, so on,
2506000	2513000	all the way up till you get to the last component.
2513000	2516000	So it's really you just take each component individually,
2516000	2519000	you square it, you add all those together,
2519000	2521000	and then you take the square root.
2521000	2524000	That's how you find the length of any vector.
2524000	2532000	Okay, just figured I would fill you in on that.
2532000	2535000	See you in the next video.
2535000	2537000	Here we're being asked to prove that vector addition
2537000	2540000	is commutative and associative,
2540000	2545000	so this will be our first proof in the linear algebra course.
2546000	2550000	First of all, let's just define three vectors,
2550000	2553000	u, v, and w are all in rn,
2553000	2556000	so they're three vectors with n components,
2556000	2560000	and let's figure out what we're trying to prove.
2560000	2563000	So we're trying to prove that vector addition is commutative,
2563000	2566000	so u plus v is the same as v plus u,
2566000	2571000	and associative, so u plus v in parentheses plus w
2571000	2575000	is the same as u plus v plus w.
2575000	2578000	Okay, so how are we going to do this?
2578000	2581000	Excuse me.
2581000	2591000	First of all, let's just start with u plus v.
2591000	2596000	So here's u plus v.
2596000	2599000	And what is this equal to?
2599000	2602000	So what's the definition of vector addition?
2602000	2604000	Well, we've already gone over this.
2604000	2614000	It's u1 plus v1 comma u2 plus v2,
2614000	2617000	and that keeps going until you get to the last component,
2617000	2624000	un plus vn, and this is the new vector.
2624000	2629000	This is the vector u plus v.
2629000	2635000	Okay, well, remember, these are real numbers.
2635000	2641000	The components of vectors in rn are real numbers,
2641000	2645000	and so we can use the commutative property of addition
2645000	2650000	of real numbers to switch those around.
2650000	2655000	So this is the same as v1 plus u1
2655000	2657000	because those are just real numbers,
2657000	2661000	and addition of real numbers is commutative.
2661000	2667000	v2 plus u2, and you keep going until you get to the end,
2667000	2673000	vn plus un.
2673000	2683000	Well, now here, this is the definition of v plus u.
2683000	2688000	That's how we define v plus u.
2688000	2692000	And so we have a simple algebraic proof here
2692000	2695000	that u plus v is equal to v plus u.
2695000	2698000	It's not really formal, there's no formal writings,
2698000	2704000	but I think you can see clearly it's a proof.
2704000	2713000	Okay, how about proving that vector addition is associative?
2713000	2716000	Well, I want you to pause and try that on your own,
2716000	2718000	but the strategy is going to be the same.
2718000	2722000	What we did is we went ahead and used the properties of real numbers,
2722000	2725000	the fact that real numbers are commutative,
2725000	2727000	to prove that vectors are commutative.
2727000	2730000	And we're going to use that same strategy for associative,
2730000	2733000	for the associative property.
2733000	2741000	Okay, pause and try that on your own.
2741000	2743000	Okay, hopefully you're back from pausing the video
2743000	2746000	and trying to prove that vectors are associative.
2746000	2749000	And now let's go through it.
2749000	2763000	So we have u plus v plus w.
2763000	2769000	Well, we know that u plus v is going to be its own vector.
2769000	2774000	It's going to be the vector u1 plus v1.
2774000	2777000	And I'm just going to leave off the second component.
2777000	2779000	We all, you've seen it enough times.
2779000	2781000	We know what's happening.
2781000	2786000	Down to u n plus v n.
2786000	2792000	So that's this whole vector here.
2792000	2802000	We can think of u plus v as its own new vector, plus w.
2803000	2806000	And again, I'm going to leave off the second one
2806000	2813000	and just write it like that.
2813000	2818000	Okay, well, now we're just adding two vectors together.
2818000	2819000	And we know how to do that.
2819000	2822000	We take the first component of the first vector,
2822000	2825000	which is u1 plus v1.
2825000	2828000	That's the first component of that vector.
2828000	2831000	And then we add the first component of the other vector,
2831000	2834000	which is just w1.
2834000	2840000	And we do that for each component, each of the components,
2840000	2850000	until we get to u n plus v n plus w n.
2850000	2857000	Okay, and now, again, we have real numbers here
2857000	2860000	and real numbers are associative.
2860000	2862000	Addition of real numbers is associative.
2862000	2868000	And so we're just going to use that property of real numbers.
2868000	2878000	So this is the same thing as u1 plus v1 plus w1.
2878000	2880000	Remember, these components are just real numbers,
2880000	2885000	so the associative property of addition holds.
2885000	2900000	Okay, and we'll do that all the way through all of these components.
2900000	2905000	And we're almost done.
2905000	2914000	And now we can break this up into the vector u.
2914000	2932000	u1 all the way to u n plus the vector v1 plus w1
2932000	2941000	all the way to the end, the n plus w n.
2941000	2954000	And this, of course, is just u plus v plus w.
2954000	2963000	And so we've proved that vector addition is associative.
2963000	2971000	So again, it's a really simple method.
2971000	2974000	All we're doing is a really simple process.
2974000	2976000	That's the word I was looking for.
2976000	2979000	All we're doing is taking the vectors,
2979000	2981000	breaking them down into their components.
2981000	2984000	And since the components are real numbers,
2984000	2988000	we can use the properties of real numbers on the component level.
2988000	2992000	And then we're kind of pulling things back out into vectors.
2992000	2994000	Okay, I hope this was helpful.
2994000	2998000	We'll see the rest of the properties of vectors in the next video.
2998000	3000000	See you then.
3000000	3005000	Okay, here are some of the algebraic properties of vectors.
3005000	3008000	I encourage you to try and prove all of these.
3008000	3011000	We just proved that vector addition is commutative,
3011000	3013000	so that's number one here.
3013000	3015000	We just proved that in the last video.
3015000	3017000	Very similarly to the way we proved that,
3017000	3021000	you could prove all of these if you know properties of real numbers.
3022000	3026000	You know addition for real numbers is associative,
3026000	3028000	and that's what we have here in step number two,
3028000	3031000	so you probably can prove that pretty easily.
3031000	3034000	When you add a real number to zero,
3034000	3037000	you get that real number back.
3037000	3040000	So you can go through all of these pretty easily.
3040000	3047000	And like I said, just use the properties of real numbers that you know.
3047000	3053000	One interesting thing here is we have this thing called the zero vector.
3053000	3056000	And the zero vector is a little bit different than zero.
3056000	3060000	It's a vector whose components are all zero.
3060000	3063000	And that distinction is somewhat important
3063000	3068000	because we can't add just a regular number zero to a vector.
3068000	3071000	We have to add a vector to a vector.
3071000	3074000	So when we do this addition, we need this to be a zero vector,
3074000	3078000	so we can add each of the components together.
3078000	3080000	But okay, so this is just for reference.
3080000	3082000	You can view it at any time.
3082000	3085000	I hope they'll have a reference sheet on the website
3085000	3087000	that you can look at and print off.
3087000	3092000	So we can use these from now on with vectors.
3092000	3094000	See you in the next video.
3094000	3097000	So if you've been following along so far,
3097000	3101000	you may have noticed that we haven't talked about multiplying two vectors.
3102000	3107000	And that's because there's a couple different ways to multiply vectors
3107000	3110000	or to define a product of vectors.
3110000	3113000	And one really interesting and useful one is called the dot product.
3113000	3117000	So when you see this dot here that indicates the dot product,
3117000	3122000	and the way the dot product is defined is maybe somewhat surprising.
3122000	3130000	The way that we do this is we do u1 times v1 plus u2 times v2.
3131000	3134000	Plus u3 times v3, so on and so on.
3134000	3142000	All the way until we get to the end, un plus un times vn.
3142000	3144000	Why is that surprising?
3144000	3148000	Why is that a surprising way to define a product of two vectors?
3148000	3150000	Well, look at the result.
3150000	3153000	What kind of object is this?
3153000	3155000	It's a number.
3155000	3157000	These two things are numbers.
3157000	3160000	When we multiply them, we just get a real number plus another real number.
3160000	3162000	All the way across.
3162000	3165000	When we add all these up, that's just a single number.
3165000	3168000	So you multiply two vectors and you just get a number out.
3168000	3173000	So you don't even get a vector back when you multiply two vectors with a dot product.
3173000	3178000	So this is sometimes called the scalar product for that reason that the result is a scalar.
3178000	3180000	It's a real number, a constant.
3180000	3184000	Those are all different ways of saying the same thing.
3184000	3189000	So for slightly different notation and maybe a little bit more concise notation,
3189000	3199000	is we could use summation notation or sigma notation and just write this like this.
3199000	3206000	So we sum up all the components from one to n, the products of those components.
3206000	3211000	So if you're comfortable and familiar with sigma notation, this is one way to write it.
3211000	3217000	I personally actually prefer this way up here because it's a little bit more informative, I think.
3217000	3222000	It's a little bit easier to see just right away without interpreting the sigma notation.
3222000	3225000	Anyways, that's that.
3225000	3229000	Let's do an example.
3229000	3255000	So if we have u is equal to 1, negative 2, and 5, and v is equal to 4, 3, and 1.
3255000	3258000	So what is this dot product?
3258000	3260000	Well, we just do exactly what it says.
3260000	3270000	1 times 4 plus negative 2 times 3 plus 5 times 1.
3270000	3275000	So we get 4 minus 6 plus 5.
3275000	3280000	That looks like 3 to me.
3281000	3291000	So maybe what I should have written was this is u minus v, or sorry, u dot v.
3291000	3294000	u dot v is equal to this.
3294000	3300000	We're taking u1 times v1 plus u2 times v2 plus u3 times vt, v3.
3300000	3306000	And then we're just simplifying the numbers and it comes out to 3.
3306000	3314000	So this maybe seems a little bit bizarre, but we'll see in the coming videos why this dot product is really useful.
3314000	3316000	See you then.
3316000	3320000	Let's look at some interesting consequences of the dot product.
3320000	3328000	And the first one that I want to look at is the consequence it has for the definition of the length of a vector.
3328000	3338000	It turns out that because the way the dot product is defined, we can think of the length of the vector as the square root of the vector dotted with itself.
3338000	3341000	And why does that make any sense?
3341000	3353000	Well, if we think about what this is equal to, this dot product here is just u1 times u1, which is u1 squared, plus u2 times u2,
3353000	3360000	which is u2 squared, plus all the way up to un times un, so un squared.
3360000	3362000	So that just comes from the definition of a dot product.
3362000	3366000	We take each of the components, we multiply them together, and we add them up.
3366000	3370000	And we already said that this is how we are going to define the length of a vector.
3370000	3376000	Remember, we did this in two dimensions where we used the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of a vector.
3376000	3380000	In more dimensions, we just keep adding the squares of the components.
3380000	3385000	If we have any more components we have, we square them and we add them underneath the square root.
3385000	3393000	So that's the length of a vector, and so it makes sense that the square root of u dot u is the length of the vector.
3393000	3408000	Also notice that, you know, this is a pretty natural follow up, but the length of a vector squared, that means, is equal to the vector dotted with itself.
3408000	3412000	So we just squared both sides of this.
3412000	3418000	Okay, that's pretty cool.
3418000	3420000	What else?
3420000	3432000	Well, the more interesting thing that happens is it has to do with the angle between two vectors.
3432000	3441000	So let's say this is u, and this is v, and this is theta.
3441000	3447000	Well, what if we did u minus v? We already talked about what u minus v is.
3447000	3451000	It's the vector that points from v to u.
3451000	3459000	Now, we've drawn a triangle here. What we can do is we can use the law of cosines to help us figure out this angle in here,
3459000	3464000	or to help us figure out this side, u minus v.
3464000	3472000	So the law of cosines tells us that the length of the side we're trying to find, u minus v,
3472000	3479000	so this is going all the way back to your geometry class, and you can look up the law of cosines if you don't remember it,
3479000	3487000	but that length squared is equal to the length of one of the sides, that's u,
3487000	3501000	the length of u squared plus the length of v squared minus the length of u times the length of v.
3501000	3507000	So I know that these length symbols get really tedious, but I'm just going to keep going with them here.
3507000	3513000	So minus the length of u times the length of v times the cosine of the angle between them.
3513000	3521000	So this comes from the law of cosines. It's really just saying c squared is equal to a squared plus b squared minus ab cos theta.
3521000	3527000	You might remember it better that way, but that's what we have. We have a side u minus v and a side u and a side v.
3527000	3532000	So what we're going to do now is we're going to examine this side.
3532000	3536000	So let's pull that side out and look at it separately.
3536000	3546000	So we have the length of u minus v squared, well that's just u minus v dotted with u minus v, so let's do that.
3546000	3552000	u minus v dotted with itself.
3552000	3562000	And now there's some properties of dot products that I haven't told you about that are going to become useful here,
3562000	3566000	like commutativity, but we'll see that in action.
3566000	3572000	So u dot u, well we just talked about that, that's the length of u squared, so let's write that as that.
3572000	3580000	u dot u is the length of u squared.
3580000	3590000	And then we have u dot, oh I have dot products in there, sorry that's a mistake, this should be u minus v, u minus v.
3590000	3606000	So u dotted with minus v, that's minus, so let me write that on the side, minus u v, well minus u dot v.
3606000	3616000	And then we have minus v dot u, so that's minus v dot u, but like I just said the dot product is commutative,
3616000	3623000	so this becomes, when we add those two together we just get minus two u dot v.
3623000	3626000	So I hope that was relatively clear.
3626000	3632000	We're just foiling this out with the dot product.
3632000	3642000	So based on what we just talked about that's minus two times u dot v.
3642000	3652000	So just to be explicit, really explicit here, that was this u coming over here and this v coming this way.
3652000	3659000	So I had to pause the video because my phone was ringing, but yeah like I was saying this, u comes and multiplies that v,
3659000	3664000	this v comes and multiplies that u, so we get minus two u dot v.
3664000	3675000	And then finally the v dotted with itself, well it's both negative so that's going to be plus the length of v squared.
3675000	3679000	This is just v dot v, turns out to be.
3679000	3682000	So this is what the left hand side of the equation becomes.
3682000	3692000	So why don't we substitute that into this, the law of cosines essentially, what we have.
3692000	3712000	So this is u squared, the length of u squared, minus two u dot v, plus the length of v squared, is equal to the length of u squared.
3712000	3720000	So this is now the right hand side of the equation from up there, plus the length of v squared,
3720000	3730000	minus the length of u times the length of v times the cosine of the angle between them.
3730000	3737000	Okay so now we get to do a lot of canceling here, so let's see.
3737000	3742000	This and this are going to go away, we can subtract those from both sides, those are going to go away.
3742000	3745000	Oh jeez I did something terribly wrong here.
3745000	3749000	This is not the law of cosines, we need a minus two.
3749000	3752000	That means we need a minus two down here.
3752000	3758000	And then we can divide the minus two on both sides though, so that's pretty cool.
3758000	3760000	So sorry for forgetting that for the whole video.
3760000	3764000	And what do we end up with after we do all that crazy cancellation?
3764000	3784000	Well we just end up with u dot v on this side is equal to the length of u times the length of v times the cosine of the angle between them.
3784000	3793000	And now that is really cool because as long as we're given the vectors u and v, we could figure out what u dot v is based on the definition,
3793000	3800000	sum up the products of the components, and then we can figure out the lengths, we know how to do that,
3800000	3805000	we just take the square root of the sum of the square of the components,
3805000	3809000	and then we have this cosine of theta so we can solve for theta,
3809000	3814000	and we can figure out the angle between two vectors just knowing what the two vectors are.
3814000	3815000	So that's really cool.
3815000	3829000	So in fact, remember that this proof came from the law of cosines which only really works in two dimensions, we're talking about a triangle.
3829000	3854000	So when we go to higher dimensions we take it as a definition that the cosine of theta is equal to u dot v divided by the length of u times the length of v.
3854000	3858000	So that just comes because we just divided by length of u, length of v.
3858000	3862000	So notice two things happen here.
3862000	3870000	One, we have an alternate definition for the dot product or an alternate way to express the dot product.
3870000	3878000	And also now we have a way to express the angle between two vectors in terms of the dot product.
3878000	3880000	And that's really cool.
3880000	3881000	So I hope this helps.
3881000	3883000	I'll see you in the next video.
3883000	3888000	Let's use what we know about the dot product to find the angle between these two vectors.
3888000	3912000	So what we're going to do is remember our little formula which says that the cosine of the angle between two vectors is equal to u dot v divided by the length of u times the length of v.
3912000	3917000	So if we want to find the angle between two vectors we have to do just a few computations.
3917000	3925000	We have to find the dot product and then we have to find the length of each vector.
3925000	3928000	So let's go through that.
3928000	3950000	So the dot product of u and v, so u dot v, u dot v is equal to two times one, that's two, plus one times one, that's one, plus negative two times one, that's just negative two or minus two.
3950000	3956000	So this comes out to be one.
3956000	3960000	So the dot product is one, let's do the length of u now in the length of v.
3960000	3972000	So the length of u is equal to the square root of two squared plus one squared plus negative two squared.
3972000	3979000	So two squared is four, plus one squared is one, plus negative two squared is four, so plus four.
3979000	3986000	So this is the square root of nine if we add those together and the square root of nine is just three.
3986000	3990000	And now let's do the length of v.
3990000	3998000	So all we're doing is just doing the necessary computations based on this formula and we derived this formula in the last video.
3998000	4001000	So if you're curious about that go back and watch that.
4001000	4007000	So now we have one squared, well that's just one, plus one squared, well that's one, plus one squared, that's one.
4007000	4012000	So this is the square root of three.
4012000	4018000	So we have our necessary pieces here, so let's put them all together.
4018000	4029000	So we have the cosine of the angle between the two vectors is equal to the dot product of the two vectors, which we found was equal to one,
4029000	4036000	divided by the length of u, that's three times the length of v, that's the square root of three.
4036000	4055000	So this is the cosine of the angle, so to find the angle theta is just equal to the arc cos or the inverse cos of one divided by three times the square root of three.
4055000	4062000	And now to find this we would have to use a calculator or a table of values.
4062000	4069000	And so I'll spare us the pain, but you should maybe do that on your calculator just to make sure you get the right answer.
4069000	4080000	And this comes out to 1.37 radians, or I should write this is approximately equal, rounding a little bit or truncating.
4080000	4095000	So this is approximately equal to 1.37 radians, and if your calculator is in degree mode, then that's approximately 78.9 degrees.
4095000	4098000	Okay, so nothing too terribly difficult.
4098000	4104000	We just got to compute the dot product, compute the length of the vectors, and everything falls into place.
4104000	4107000	Okay, see you in the next video.
4107000	4113000	In the last video we learned the definition of the cosine between two vectors.
4113000	4122000	In fact, we pretty much derived this, so we said the cosine of the angle between two vectors is u dot v divided by the length of u times the length of v.
4122000	4130000	So let's see what we can determine about two vectors when they're perpendicular.
4130000	4136000	So if two vectors are perpendicular, what we say is they're orthogonal.
4136000	4140000	So that's the word we use for perpendicular vectors.
4140000	4142000	And let's see what we can determine.
4142000	4144000	So u and v here.
4144000	4151000	So this angle, of course, is pi over 2, or 90 degrees.
4151000	4153000	And what does that mean?
4153000	4169000	Well, by our definition of the angle between two vectors, that means that the cosine of pi over 2 is equal to this dot product.
4169000	4173000	And while I'm writing this, think about what is the cosine of pi over 2?
4173000	4175000	What is that equal to?
4175000	4181000	We know what it is, it's just a number, right?
4181000	4185000	Well, the cosine of pi over 2 is zero.
4185000	4191000	So all three of these things are equal, and they're all equal to zero.
4191000	4194000	Excuse me.
4194000	4196000	So what does that tell us?
4196000	4203000	Well, that tells us that u dot v must be equal to zero.
4203000	4209000	So this implies that u dot v is equal to zero.
4209000	4214000	And that's because the denominator here will never make this fraction zero.
4214000	4220000	Okay, so if the vectors are orthogonal, then the dot product is zero.
4220000	4222000	And in fact, that works in the other direction.
4222000	4226000	If the dot product is zero, the vectors are orthogonal.
4226000	4229000	So now we have a definition of orthogonal.
4229000	4232000	Two vectors are orthogonal.
4232000	4240000	So two, well, let me write this, two vectors u and v are orthogonal if and only if.
4240000	4245000	If you've never seen this before, this is shorthand notation for if and only if.
4245000	4256000	Two vectors are u and v are orthogonal if and only if u dot v is equal to zero.
4256000	4261000	So now we have a nice, easy way to test if two vectors are orthogonal.
4261000	4266000	So let's take a look at that.
4266000	4272000	So let's take some two easy vectors with just two components and see what happens.
4272000	4288000	So let's say u is equal to negative three, four, and v is equal to four, three.
4288000	4292000	So let's do their dot product really quickly.
4292000	4305000	u dot v is equal to negative three times four, negative three times four, plus four times three.
4305000	4311000	Well, it's pretty clear this is negative 12 plus 12, so that's zero.
4311000	4315000	So by definition, these two vectors are orthogonal.
4315000	4321000	So let's take a look at what they look like if we were to graph them.
4321000	4332000	So u is negative three, so go over three up four, negative three four, so it's kind of a rough sketch.
4332000	4339000	And then v is positive four and up three, so about there.
4339000	4347000	And even though this is just a rough sketch, it seems pretty reasonable that these two vectors are orthogonal.
4347000	4350000	That looks to be about 90 degrees in there.
4350000	4356000	And we know for certain, because this dot product is zero, we know for certain that they are orthogonal.
4356000	4363000	And just by the sketch, they, you know, that kind of confirms in our mind if we had any doubt that they are indeed orthogonal.
4363000	4368000	Okay, so this is the definition of orthogonal. I'll see you in the next video.
4368000	4381000	Okay, here we have a proof to do, we need to prove that the diagonals of a parallelogram are perpendicular if and only if the length of their sides are equal.
4381000	4393000	Okay, so the first thing that I want to do is just get some intuition about what we're actually trying to prove and write a mathematical statement of what we're trying to prove.
4393000	4397000	So kind of convert these words into math.
4397000	4401000	The first thing I'm going to do is just draw a parallelogram to see what's going on.
4401000	4406000	So here are two vectors, u and v, and we know we can make a parallelogram out of them.
4406000	4411000	So here's, well, let me switch to a thinner brush.
4411000	4415000	So here's u and here is v.
4415000	4420000	And we know we can make a parallelogram out of them, so let's do that.
4420000	4430000	Oh, and I should tell you that I made these vectors exactly equal in length because it says that we want them to be equal in length, so I wanted to see what was going on with that.
4430000	4445000	And now we know how to create the diagonals, right? If we do head-to-tail addition, we can get this main diagonal and we know that that's u plus v.
4445000	4452000	And then how do we get the other diagonal?
4452000	4467000	Well, the other diagonal is just u minus v, so that is here, u minus v.
4467000	4478000	We talked about that in vector subtraction. The vector pointing from the head of one vector to the head of the other is vector subtraction, essentially.
4478000	4483000	Okay, so we have our two diagonals. Let's see if we can convert this statement into some math.
4483000	4495000	So what we're trying to prove is that the diagonals, u plus v, are perpendicular, right?
4495000	4502000	U plus v and u minus v, we're trying to prove that these are perpendicular.
4502000	4509000	So we could say that their dot product is zero, so the diagonals are perpendicular.
4509000	4518000	That's this statement, the diagonals are perpendicular. If and only if the length of their sides are equal.
4518000	4525000	So this is length of u is equal to length of v.
4525000	4531000	Okay, so now we have a proof and we need to go in both directions.
4531000	4548000	So let's go forward first. Let's say assume that the dot product is zero.
4548000	4557000	So assume that the diagonals are perpendicular or orthogonal.
4557000	4562000	We're going to assume this and now we need to prove that the lengths are equal.
4562000	4568000	Okay, well let's just see what happens through this equation if we expand it out.
4568000	4573000	So that equation implies what is the dot product expanded here?
4573000	4595000	So we're going to have u dot u, which we know is the length of u squared, minus u dot v plus v dot u.
4595000	4604000	And then we're going to get minus the length of v squared because this is just minus v dot v.
4604000	4611000	Okay, the dot product is commutative and so u dot v is the same thing as v dot u.
4611000	4617000	So we have a minus v dot u dot v here and a plus u dot v, so those are going to cancel out.
4617000	4621000	Oh, and I kind of made a mistake here, sorry about that.
4621000	4624000	This is an implication.
4624000	4632000	The fact that this is equal to zero implies that this statement is equal to zero because all we did was expand it out,
4632000	4638000	which in turn, let me switch colors here, well maybe not, maybe I'll leave it where it was,
4638000	4648000	which in turn implies that the length of u squared minus the length of v squared,
4648000	4652000	oops I forgot my vector there, is equal to zero,
4652000	4663000	which again implies that the length of u squared is equal to the length of v squared.
4663000	4668000	Well, length of vectors are always positive and so we could take the square root
4668000	4675000	and not really worry about messing up this equality because we're not going to need the negative part of the square root
4675000	4680000	because we know both of these lengths are positive.
4680000	4686000	So we take the square root of both sides and we get exactly what we wanted,
4686000	4693000	that the length of u is equal to the length of v.
4693000	4700000	Okay, so we proved that if the vectors, if the diagonals are perpendicular,
4700000	4703000	then their lengths must be equal.
4703000	4714000	Let's go ahead and prove that if the lengths are equal then the vectors must be perpendicular.
4714000	4725000	So I'm just going to write this kind of backwards implies arrow just to indicate we're doing the other part of the proof now.
4725000	4737000	So we're going to assume that the lengths are equal and what we want to get to is that the vectors are perpendicular,
4737000	4740000	or the diagonals are perpendicular.
4740000	4742000	So we're going to assume this.
4742000	4746000	Now this doesn't seem, it seems like well where do we go from here?
4746000	4752000	How do we construct a proof out of just this equality?
4752000	4768000	Well what I would do is I would say, okay, consider the dot product of u plus v dotted with u minus v.
4768000	4770000	So the dot product of the diagonals.
4770000	4774000	Now we're not going to say that this is equal to zero, we can't do that.
4774000	4779000	That's what we're trying to prove but we can just see what comes out when we take this dot product.
4779000	4785000	We know that this dot product exists, we have two vectors, we can take their dot products.
4785000	4788000	Okay, so let's do that.
4788000	4795000	Well this is equal to, that dot product is equal to, well we already did this.
4795000	4807000	It was the length of u squared minus the u dot v plus u dot v.
4807000	4813000	I just commuted there, it would be v dot u but I just commuted the two vectors.
4813000	4819000	And then minus the length of v squared.
4819000	4835000	And this is equal to the length of u squared minus the length of v squared.
4835000	4841000	Since u is equal to v we can substitute one and for the other and we know of course that this is equal to zero.
4841000	4847000	So we took the dot product and we found out that yes the dot product is equal to zero.
4847000	4851000	So that's it, we're done with our proof.
4851000	4854000	We've proved that if the lengths are equal the dot product is zero.
4854000	4859000	We've proved that if the dot product is zero then the lengths are equal.
4859000	4871000	And again just one more time, when I say that the dot product is zero what I'm implying by definition is that these two vectors are perpendicular.
4871000	4877000	And of course from the beginning of the video those two vectors represent the diagonals.
4877000	4881000	Okay, so that's somewhat of an interesting proof.
4881000	4888000	The diagonals of a parallelogram are only perpendicular if and only if the lengths of the sides are equal.
4888000	4890000	Okay, see you in the next video.
