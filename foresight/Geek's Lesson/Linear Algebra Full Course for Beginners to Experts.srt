00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Hello and welcome all of you to Math 2050 Applied Linear Algebra.

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:14,000
I think we'll start off by talking about just what is linear algebra.

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
You actually are familiar with it somewhat.

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
You've had courses in algebra, I'm sure.

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:28,000
In general, what we think of in particular for this course is that

6
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
linear algebra is a study of systems of linear equations.

7
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
So that begs the question, what's a linear equation?

8
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Well, a linear equation is one of this form.

9
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:46,000
a1x1 plus a2x2 plus dot dot dot anxn equals b.

10
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
And here the x's are the variables.

11
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,000
The a's are called coefficients.

12
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
And b is the right hand side value.

13
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Here all the a's and b are typically real numbers.

14
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:10,000
And then you ask, well, what's a real number?

15
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Well, a real number is basically you can think of that as any number that you can find on a number line.

16
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:25,000
So that includes integers, rational numbers, irrational numbers,

17
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:31,000
negative numbers, positive numbers, zero, just about any number.

18
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Or any number you can find on a number line.

19
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
It's a real number.

20
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:39,000
This is as opposed to complex or imaginary numbers.

21
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Those would not be real numbers.

22
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:45,000
So for our purposes, we'll not be dealing with complex numbers.

23
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:51,000
We'll stick to just real numbers.

24
00:01:51,000 --> 00:02:02,000
In our equations, the linear part means that we don't allow nonlinear expressions of the variables.

25
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:09,000
So terms like x1 squared or x1 times x2, those type terms are nonlinear.

26
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:16,000
And so we don't allow those type expressions.

27
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:21,000
So here's a couple of sample linear equations.

28
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Those are just typical.

29
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
The first one has two variables here.

30
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Here's one with three variables.

31
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:33,000
The first one, you'll recognize, has two variables.

32
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:39,000
So that just defines a line in the plane, in the xy plane here.

33
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Got three variables.

34
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:45,000
So that actually defines a plane in three dimensions.

35
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:51,000
So we'll talk more about that as we go along.

36
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,000
So we're back to what is linear algebra.

37
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,000
So we've talked about what's a linear equation.

38
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:02,000
And linear algebra is a study of systems of linear equations.

39
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
So what's a system?

40
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,000
That just means you have multiple equations.

41
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:14,000
So for example, let's go to the drawing board.

42
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Here's a system of two equations and two unknowns.

43
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:23,000
And all of you have had college algebra.

44
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,000
So you're familiar with the system of this form.

45
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:35,000
And you probably learned a couple of different ways to solve this system when you were in algebra.

46
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:40,000
And so we're just going to talk about that first off here.

47
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:45,000
If I asked you how would you solve this system, then you might say,

48
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:51,000
well, I'd use substitution because that seems like a way to go.

49
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:55,000
If you look here, you've got the x2 term.

50
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
You can solve this equation for x2.

51
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
So let's do that.

52
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:07,000
So from this equation, I can get x2 equals 28 minus 4x1.

53
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:12,000
And then I substitute this expression for x2 back into the first equation.

54
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:22,000
So that gives me 2x1 plus 3 times this stuff here, 28 minus 4x1.

55
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,000
And that equals 24.

56
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:38,000
So then I simply 2x1 plus 3 times 28 is 84 minus 12x1 equals 24.

57
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:47,000
So that gives me, it looks like negative 10x1 equals 24 minus 84 would be negative 60.

58
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:51,000
So it looks like x1 is equal to 6.

59
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:56,000
And then if x1 is 6, we can go back and plug in here to figure out what x2 is.

60
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:03,000
So x2 is going to be 28 minus 4 times 6.

61
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:07,000
So x2 is equal to 4.

62
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:11,000
So, oops, back up here.

63
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:22,000
So x, there we go, x2 equals 4, x1 equals 6 is our solution.

64
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,000
So that's one way to solve this system.

65
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:32,000
That's using the method of substitution.

66
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Another method that's sometimes used is to go back and look at the system and try to eliminate one of the variables

67
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:51,000
by multiplying one of the equations, or maybe even both the equations,

68
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:57,000
by constant and then adding or subtracting one from the other.

69
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:01,000
So I'm going to try that method here.

70
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:08,000
So I'm going to multiply this first equation by negative 2.

71
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:12,000
And I'll just write what I get down here.

72
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:17,000
So negative 2 times 2x1 gives me negative 4x1.

73
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:25,000
And then negative 6x2, then negative 2 times 24 would be negative 48.

74
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:31,000
And then if I add these two together, these two that I have here,

75
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:34,000
then notice that the x1's cancel out.

76
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
So they're gone.

77
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
I've eliminated x1 in here.

78
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:45,000
If I add, I get negative 5x2 equals negative 20.

79
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:50,000
So that says x2 equals 4.

80
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:57,000
And then to get x1, I can substitute that back into either of these equations.

81
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:03,000
And we already know that x1 is 6, so I won't go through that process.

82
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
So there we go.

83
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
We have our solution.

84
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:11,000
And that's using the method of elimination.

85
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:15,000
You systematically eliminate variables.

86
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:22,000
So those are the two methods that you probably learned back in algebra class

87
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:26,000
for solving the system.

88
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Let's take a look at what we're doing graphically.

89
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Let's take a graphical look at it.

90
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:40,000
So I go back to my equations and I draw them on a graph.

91
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Let's see if I can come over here.

92
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:51,000
And I'll try to do this.

93
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
All right.

94
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:58,000
So if I graph my equations where this is going to be my x1 axis,

95
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:02,000
this will be my x2 axis.

96
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Let's see.

97
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:07,000
If I look at the first equation, if x1 is 0,

98
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:12,000
well, actually I'm going to start with this one because if x1 is 0 here,

99
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
then x2 is 28.

100
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:16,000
So that gets us way up here.

101
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
So there's 28.

102
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:24,000
So I've got one point right there at 0, 28.

103
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Then if x2 is 0, we get x1 equals 7.

104
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:34,000
So I'm going to scoot this over just a little bit.

105
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Just give me a little more room here.

106
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Let me get this out.

107
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
OK.

108
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:48,000
So it looks like I want to try to get my scale as best I can.

109
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:52,000
So it looks like this would be about 7.

110
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:57,000
And so my other point is here at 7, 0.

111
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:03,000
So I've got one line that comes like this.

112
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:08,000
And let me see if I can do a better job drawing that.

113
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Here not only I'm not going to get a little better angle on that with my computer here.

114
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
OK.

115
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Well, that's not going to get either.

116
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Let's try one more time.

117
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Looks like I am not going to be able to make this work.

118
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Let's see.

119
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
One more time.

120
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
OK.

121
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
I'm going to just call that good.

122
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Let's call this 7 right here.

123
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
All right.

124
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,000
So then let's do, let's look at the other one.

125
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:46,000
The other equation is I've got this one.

126
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:50,000
If x1 is 0, it looks like x2 is 8.

127
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:54,000
So that's going to be along about right there.

128
00:09:54,000 --> 00:10:00,000
And if x2 is 0, it looks like x1 is 12.

129
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:04,000
So that's going to be somewhere along about right here.

130
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Let me try once again, see if I can make a line.

131
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:11,000
That one's not terrible there.

132
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
All right.

133
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:17,000
So this is about 7 right there.

134
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Let's take that away.

135
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
All right.

136
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:24,000
So if we look, my scale is better, be better to see.

137
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:29,000
But along about there, that's the point where those lines intersect.

138
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:32,000
And so that's the point 6, 4.

139
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
So my scale is better.

140
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:37,000
It would look better to get the general idea.

141
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:42,000
So what we're looking at here is we've got this system.

142
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:48,000
And we want to find x1 and x2 that satisfy both those equations.

143
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,000
So since each of those equations represents a line,

144
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:56,000
then when we're looking for a point that satisfies both,

145
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
then that means it's a point that's on both lines.

146
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:03,000
So that's the point where the lines intersect.

147
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
OK.

148
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:12,000
So in this example, we ended up with a unique solution.

149
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
All right.

150
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
A unique solution.

151
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:22,000
That means exactly one solution.

152
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
OK.

153
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Now let's think.

154
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Are there any other possibilities?

155
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:32,000
No matter what your system is, you're always going to have exactly one solution.

156
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:36,000
I think you know that that is not the case.

157
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,000
So what are the possibilities?

158
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
You don't have exactly one solution.

159
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:44,000
How about do you have a solution every time?

160
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:48,000
And you probably know that the answer is no.

161
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:54,000
And that happens when you have a situation like this.

162
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
There's one line.

163
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
There's another.

164
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
They're parallel.

165
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
And so they never intersect.

166
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:04,000
And so this case, you have no solution.

167
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:07,000
No solution in that case.

168
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
OK.

169
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,000
So we've got zero solutions.

170
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
You have one solution.

171
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
How about two?

172
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Can you come up with a system where you have two solutions?

173
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
Let's think on that.

174
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Two solutions.

175
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Now in my class one day, I had somebody say, well, what if you drew another line here?

176
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:30,000
So you had a line like this, right?

177
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,000
Then you got the intersect there, the intersect there.

178
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:36,000
So there's two solutions, right?

179
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:43,000
And the answer is, well, no, because here you've got three lines.

180
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:47,000
And so if you were trying to solve a system with these three lines,

181
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:53,000
then that means that you need to find a point where all three intersect at the same time.

182
00:12:53,000 --> 00:13:02,000
So in this case, there's still no solution because there's no point at which all three lines intersect.

183
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:05,000
I've also had students say, well, hey, what if you had a parabola?

184
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
So you had a case like this.

185
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,000
There's a parabola.

186
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
You got a line going through it.

187
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:13,000
There's the intersect right there, intersect right there.

188
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:16,000
So you got two solutions.

189
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:23,000
Now this is legitimate because you got two functions in the intersect at these two places.

190
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:29,000
The problem is that this parabola is not a linear function, right?

191
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:36,000
The parabola is quadratic, right?

192
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,000
Not linear.

193
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:44,000
So that case doesn't work either.

194
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:59,000
So it turns out that if you have a system of linear equations and you don't have no solution,

195
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:05,000
you don't have exactly one solution, then you must have an infinite number of solutions, right?

196
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:16,000
So infinite number of solutions.

197
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:23,000
And in two dimensions, that's a little bit tough to come up with a good example.

198
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
The best you can do is two dimensions.

199
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:33,000
It is like one like this where you have something like 2x1 plus 3x2 equals 10.

200
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:38,000
And then maybe 4x1 plus 6x2 equals 20.

201
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:43,000
Now on the surface, it looks like you got two equations.

202
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:49,000
But when you go to graph this, what do you find?

203
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:55,000
Well, you find that this is actually the same equation because I wrote it so that the second one was just a multiple of the first.

204
00:14:55,000 --> 00:15:00,000
So when you draw it, if you were drawing the graph, whatever it might look like,

205
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:05,000
you graph one of the lines and then you graph the other one and it sits right on top of the first one.

206
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:09,000
So that, in that case, any point on the line would be a solution.

207
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:15,000
And so there would be an infinite number of solutions.

208
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:24,000
Okay, so just to recap, let's go back to our slide.

209
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:27,000
Let's go to the next one.

210
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:30,000
So these are your possibilities.

211
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:38,000
A system of equations has either no solution, exactly one solution, in which case we say it's a unique solution,

212
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:42,000
or it has an infinite number of solutions.

213
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:46,000
And a little more terminology for you.

214
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:49,000
We say a system is consistent.

215
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:56,000
Consistence, the word we'll use a lot, so a system is consistent if it has at least one solution.

216
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:00,000
So that means either unique or an infinite number, but it has at least one solution.

217
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
It's consistent.

218
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
Otherwise, we say it's inconsistent.

219
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:11,000
So inconsistent means that it has no solution at all.

220
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:22,000
Okay, so I think we'll stop there for this one and we'll pick up with this on the next video.

221
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
Okay, we're back now.

222
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:28,000
We're talking about solving systems of equations.

223
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:37,000
And we need a systematic method because probably as you can recall from your days in college algebra,

224
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:42,000
once you get up to even a three by three system, then things start to get a little messy.

225
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:48,000
And so we're going to talk now about how to, a systematic method.

226
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:53,000
Okay, a method that will work no matter what size your system, no matter how many rows, how many columns,

227
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:56,000
or how many variables, how many equations.

228
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:00,000
It's an algorithm that will work no matter what.

229
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:06,000
Before we do that, I want to go back and look at that system that we were talking about earlier,

230
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:10,000
which I have on my notepad here.

231
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:15,000
So remember, I just want to refresh your memory about what we did there.

232
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:26,000
The second way we used to solve this system, if you recall, was we decided to multiply this equation by negative two.

233
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:31,000
And then we added that to the second equation.

234
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:34,000
So let's just go through that quickly again.

235
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:42,000
So we ended with negative 4x1 minus 6x2 equals negative 48.

236
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:45,000
And then we added that.

237
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:48,000
So the x1's canceled out.

238
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:57,000
Then we ended up with negative 5x2 here equals negative 20.

239
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:00,000
So x2 is equal to 4.

240
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:06,000
And then we didn't actually do it because we'd done it before, but I'll go through.

241
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:09,000
At this point to find x1, you have to plug back in.

242
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
You can plug into either one.

243
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
Let's just go back to the first one.

244
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:18,000
First equation will have 2x1 plus 3 times x2.

245
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
And we know that x2 is 4.

246
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:23,000
So we plug that in equals 24.

247
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:28,000
So we get 2x1 equals, looks like 12.

248
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
So x1 equals 6.

249
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:38,000
So there's our solution that we found in the previous video.

250
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:46,000
To do this in a systematic way, we set up a matrix.

251
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:53,000
And a matrix is just a rectangular array of numbers.

252
00:18:53,000 --> 00:19:05,000
So in this case, we would be interested in this matrix where I take the coefficients.

253
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
So I just write it like that.

254
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:11,000
So the first row here represents the first equation.

255
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:14,000
The second row represents the second equation.

256
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:23,000
This matrix is called an augmented matrix.

257
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:34,000
And it's called augmented because it has this right hand side column included.

258
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:41,000
A lot of times we're only interested in this matrix, which we call the coefficient matrix.

259
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:50,000
Since it includes only the coefficients of the variables.

260
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
So that's coefficient matrix.

261
00:19:52,000 --> 00:20:00,000
If we augment or add on the right hand side, then we get the augmented matrix, which is this one.

262
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:05,000
And this is actually the one that we'll work on most of the time when we're solving.

263
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:10,000
If we want to solve a particular system, then we would work with the augmented matrix.

264
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:13,000
Now, what do we do with the augmented matrix?

265
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:25,000
Well, it turns out that there are three row operations, three operations in our toolbox that we can perform on this matrix in order to solve the system.

266
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:32,000
So to do that, let's go back to our slides here.

267
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:37,000
And here we'll talk about our elementary row operations.

268
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:41,000
So number one is to interchange or swap two rows.

269
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:54,000
So that since a row in a matrix represents an equation, that just means we're reordering the equations, which as you know has no effect on the solution.

270
00:20:54,000 --> 00:21:01,000
We could also multiply all the entries in a particular row by a nonzero constant.

271
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:10,000
No, I can't multiply by zero because that would be essentially throwing out that equation and that wouldn't work, but you can multiply by any nonzero constant.

272
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:15,000
And the other is sounds kind of complicated, but it's really not.

273
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:21,000
And really this third one is the one that you'll do 99% of the time.

274
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:24,000
And it is the replacement operation.

275
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:35,000
It's where you replace one row by the sum of itself and that should be a multiple of another row.

276
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:41,000
So you replace one row by the sum of itself and a multiple of another row.

277
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:44,000
It's an error right there.

278
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:47,000
So let's talk about how you do that.

279
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:50,000
Let's go back to our example.

280
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:54,000
And that operation is actually what we did here.

281
00:21:54,000 --> 00:22:06,000
If you go back and look, you can think of it as we were replacing the second equation by the sum of itself and a multiple of the first row.

282
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:16,000
So we multiply the first row, took a multiple of the first row, added it to the second, and so we ended up with this new equation right here.

283
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:22,000
So we're going to do the same thing except in matrix form.

284
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:27,000
And I like to use a shorthand when I'm doing these operations.

285
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:32,000
And so for the replacement operation, I write it like this.

286
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:39,000
I'm going to multiply negative two times row one and add that to row two.

287
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:42,000
So negative two times row one, added to row two.

288
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
Now this doesn't change row one.

289
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:50,000
So I'm just going to write that just as I normally would.

290
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,000
No change there.

291
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,000
But row two is going to change.

292
00:22:54,000 --> 00:23:00,000
So I'm going to multiply each entry in row one by negative two and add it to the corresponding entry in row two.

293
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:04,000
So negative two times two is negative four plus four.

294
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,000
That gives me zero.

295
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:10,000
So I've eliminated x one from this row.

296
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:16,000
Then negative two times three is negative six plus one is negative five.

297
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:21,000
Okay, so just a reminder there, how did I get that?

298
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:27,000
I multiplied negative two times three and added it to one.

299
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:31,000
So negative two times this entry plus one.

300
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,000
Then the same thing in the third column.

301
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:41,000
So negative two times negative 24 is negative 48 plus 28 is negative 20.

302
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:46,000
So here I'll get negative 20 and just make that clear.

303
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:52,000
That's negative two times 24 plus 28.

304
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:58,000
Okay, and so you can see if you wrote out the equation that corresponded to this row,

305
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:05,000
it looks exactly like this equation here that we ended up with.

306
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:12,000
And so at this point, now I have in my second row only one variable and so I can solve.

307
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:19,000
So I would say, okay, from row two I get negative five x two equals negative 20.

308
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:23,000
So that means x two equals four.

309
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,000
Okay, just like I did before.

310
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:31,000
And then we do something a little more space here.

311
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:43,000
Then we do a process called back substitution.

312
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:49,000
Okay, and that just means you back up to the next row and you substitute.

313
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:53,000
So if we back up to the next row, then that would be backing up to the first row.

314
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:57,000
And there I've got two x one plus three x two.

315
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,000
But now I know what x two is.

316
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,000
It's four.

317
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,000
So that's the substitution part.

318
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:05,000
Okay, so I plug that in equals 24.

319
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:09,000
And we know that we end up with x one equals six at this point.

320
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:21,000
Okay, so here we solve the system using elementary row operations and then using back substitution.

321
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:27,000
Let's see, just one more note on why this is okay to do this.

322
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:32,000
Let's go back to our slides.

323
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:35,000
A little more terminology for you.

324
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:38,000
We say two matrices are row equivalent.

325
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:45,000
If there is a sequence of elementary row operations that transforms one matrix into the other.

326
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:53,000
So the way I usually say that is they're row equivalent if you can get from one to the other by doing elementary row operations.

327
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:56,000
Okay, doesn't mean they're equal.

328
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,000
Row equivalent does not mean the matrices are equal.

329
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:03,000
It just means that you can get from one to the other by doing elementary row operations.

330
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:06,000
Okay, and then here's the clincher.

331
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,000
That's why this works.

332
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:12,000
So remember our goal is to solve a system.

333
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:25,000
And so we need to know that when we do these row operations, we're not changing the solution or the solution set.

334
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:29,000
Okay, and so this statement gives us that assurance.

335
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:36,000
It says if the augmented matrices of two systems are row equivalent, then the two systems have the same solution set.

336
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:39,000
So that means we can start off with one matrix.

337
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:55,000
We can do row operations and get to another one that we can solve easily and know that the solution that we get based on the last matrix will be the same for the first one.

338
00:26:55,000 --> 00:27:02,000
So that's why we can do these row operations in order to solve a system of equations.

339
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:09,000
This leads us to two questions.

340
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:15,000
The first one is, is the system consistent?

341
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:19,000
Does it have at least one solution?

342
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:30,000
And if that's so, if it's consistent, then is that solution unique or are there an infinite number of solutions?

343
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:33,000
So we'll talk about how to determine.

344
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:35,000
Number one is the system consistent.

345
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:43,000
Number two, if it is, then how do you know if there's a unique solution or an infinite number of solutions?

346
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:52,000
Okay, we're going to stop here and I'll do one more video that has some problems worked out for you.

347
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:56,000
So that'll be next.

348
00:27:56,000 --> 00:28:04,000
Okay, now I want to do a few sample problems from section 1.1 of the textbook.

349
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:07,000
So first let's look at number 14.

350
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:12,000
So in the problem, they're giving you a system of equations and asking you to solve it.

351
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:18,000
So I've already got it here in the augmented matrix form.

352
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:26,000
And so we just need to do elementary row operations in order to try to solve the system.

353
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:38,000
So the first thing we want to do is make sure that up here in the 1-1 position, that's the first row, first column, we've got a non-zero value if possible.

354
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:41,000
Well, it's already non-zero, so we don't need to do anything.

355
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:48,000
If this had been a zero, we would want to swap rows in order to get a non-zero value here.

356
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:57,000
Okay, we already have one, so then we can next turn our attention to creating zeros in the column below this leading entry.

357
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:04,000
A leading entry is the first non-zero value in a row, so we want to create zeros below it.

358
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:07,000
So we need to create a zero in this position here.

359
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:15,000
So we need to figure out what do we multiply by this one and add to negative one to get zero.

360
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:20,000
Clearly, multiply by one or don't multiply by anything.

361
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:25,000
We really just need to add the first row to the second and that will give us a zero here.

362
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:36,000
So I'm going to add row one to row two.

363
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:41,000
Now that does not change row one, so I'm just going to repeat it here.

364
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:46,000
And it doesn't change row three.

365
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:53,000
All right, so now row two, we've got a zero there.

366
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:59,000
Then we'll have negative three plus one gives us negative two.

367
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:07,000
Zero plus five is five and five plus two gives us seven here.

368
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:13,000
All right, so now we've got our leading entry zeros below it.

369
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:18,000
We're done with that column, so we move on to the next column and down a row.

370
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:23,000
So we want a non-zero element here, which we already have.

371
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:28,000
And normally we would just want a zero out below it.

372
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:38,000
But given that we have a one here, that's kind of a nicer number to work with.

373
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:45,000
So I'm going to actually swap rows two and three at this point.

374
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:53,000
Swap row two and row three.

375
00:30:53,000 --> 00:31:02,000
So row one doesn't change.

376
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:06,000
Nero two is the old row three.

377
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:11,000
And the nero three is the old row two.

378
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:13,000
All right, so I've got that.

379
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:19,000
Now the reason I did that was because this just makes the arithmetic easier

380
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:21,000
and I don't have to deal with fractions.

381
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:23,000
Otherwise, if I left the negative two there, I'd have to figure out,

382
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:27,000
you know, what do I multiply by this to add to one to get zero?

383
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:31,000
And I would have to carry that out through the rest of that row.

384
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:34,000
So this is just easier arithmetic wise.

385
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:39,000
So now I've got a one here and I need to zero out underneath it.

386
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:44,000
So I need to multiply by two and add the negative two to get a zero here.

387
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:55,000
So my next operation is two times row two added to row three.

388
00:31:55,000 --> 00:32:01,000
So row one again doesn't change.

389
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:04,000
Row two doesn't change.

390
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:09,000
And row three, let's get my zero there and I'll get two.

391
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:14,000
So we're here two times one plus five is seven.

392
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:19,000
Then we've got two times zero plus seven is seven.

393
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:23,000
Okay, now at this point I'm done with the second column

394
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:29,000
and I move over and I'm done with a matrix because now in the third row

395
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:32,000
I've eliminated all the variables except for one.

396
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:42,000
So from the third row, I get seven x three equals seven.

397
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:45,000
So I can solve for x three, it's going to be one.

398
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:52,000
And then I do the back substitution.

399
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:58,000
Alright, so that means back up, so back up to the second row

400
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:02,000
which looks like if I write down the equation corresponding to the second row

401
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:06,000
the x two plus x three equals zero.

402
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:11,000
But I know what x three is, so I plug that in.

403
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:14,000
And I've got x two equals negative one.

404
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:19,000
Okay, then I back up again to the first row.

405
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:27,000
The first row, that equation looks like x one minus three x two equals five.

406
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:37,000
I know what x two is, plug that in.

407
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:40,000
So a little more room here.

408
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:45,000
And so I get x one is equal to, let's see, that's a plus three.

409
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:48,000
So we're going over minus three, so it would be two.

410
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:56,000
So x one equals two, x two equals negative one, x three equals one.

411
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:59,000
There's a solution to my system.

412
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:09,000
So this system here had a unique solution, just one.

413
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:14,000
Alright, let's go on and look at another homework problem.

414
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:19,000
This time I want to go to number twelve.

415
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:24,000
Okay, so still in section one point one, problem number twelve.

416
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:29,000
Alright, so before we do that, let's look at one thing.

417
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:31,000
Before we do that, let's look at one other thing.

418
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:36,000
Suppose I have a system that looks like this.

419
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:42,000
Two x one plus three x two equals ten.

420
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:49,000
And how about four x one plus six x two equals twelve.

421
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:55,000
Now if you examine that a little bit, you're going to see that to get this second equation,

422
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:58,000
I just multiply the first one by two.

423
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:01,000
So two times two is four, two times three is six.

424
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:04,000
But then I didn't multiply this by two.

425
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:09,000
Actually I did, and then I didn't want to get that same value, so I changed it.

426
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:16,000
So just based on that analysis, it seems that this system should have no solution.

427
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:24,000
And if you were solving it using elimination, say, maybe you'd multiply,

428
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:27,000
maybe you didn't notice that it's not going to have a solution.

429
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:31,000
So you're just merely going along your way solving it.

430
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:38,000
So if we multiply three by negative two, we're going to get negative four x one minus six x two

431
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:42,000
equals negative two times ten, so negative twenty.

432
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:46,000
Then we'd add that, and here we get zero.

433
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:51,000
Here we get zero, so on the left we've got zero.

434
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:53,000
And on the right, what do we have?

435
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:55,000
Negative eight.

436
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:59,000
Well, zero can't equal negative eight, right?

437
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:04,000
So this is what tells us that this system has no solution.

438
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:14,000
We get to this point where we have zero on the left and something not zero on the right.

439
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:18,000
You've got a non-zero value over here on the right.

440
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:33,000
So if we had thrown that into a matrix, it would look like this.

441
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:37,000
Alright, so we do one row operation, same one we did up there.

442
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:41,000
Negative two, row one plus row two.

443
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:45,000
Alright, so row one doesn't change.

444
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:52,000
And row two, get negative two times two is negative four plus four gives us zero.

445
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:57,000
Negative two times three is negative six plus six gives me zero.

446
00:36:57,000 --> 00:37:04,000
Negative two times ten is negative twenty plus twelve is negative eight.

447
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:08,000
Alright, so if you look at this, we're the same thing, right?

448
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:13,000
We've got all zeros.

449
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:18,000
And over here on the right, we've got something that's not zero.

450
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:34,000
Okay, this is the marker that you look for to indicate no solution.

451
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:39,000
Okay, all zeros on the left, something not zero on the right.

452
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:41,000
Okay, so keep that in mind.

453
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:44,000
We're going to be using that all semester.

454
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:53,000
Okay, so now let's go to number twelve.

455
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:55,000
Okay, still in section one point one.

456
00:37:55,000 --> 00:38:07,000
So number twelve, one negative three, four negative four.

457
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:12,000
Negative seven, seven.

458
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:22,000
Negative eight, negative four, six, negative one, and seven.

459
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:25,000
Okay, and this is an augmented matrix.

460
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:28,000
So we start, we do our row operations.

461
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:33,000
So we look, we've got a non-zero value here, so we want to zero out underneath.

462
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:40,000
So the first thing I'm going to do is negative three times row one plus row two,

463
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:44,000
so that I can generate a zero there.

464
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:50,000
So I've got one, negative three, four, negative four.

465
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:56,000
Alright, first row and the third row don't change.

466
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:59,000
And this one, I'm going to get my zero there.

467
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:06,000
Alright, negative three times negative three is nine, minus seven gives me two there.

468
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:13,000
Negative three times four is negative twelve, plus seven is negative five.

469
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:19,000
Negative three times negative four is twelve, minus eight is four.

470
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:21,000
Okay, so I've got my zero there.

471
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:24,000
I need to keep working down, get a zero in this position.

472
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:34,000
So the next operation I'm going to do will be four times row one plus row three.

473
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:40,000
So again, row one doesn't change.

474
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:44,000
Row two doesn't change.

475
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:51,000
And row three, I get my zero there, so I'm going to put four, minus four gives me zero.

476
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:58,000
Four times negative three is negative twelve, plus six is negative six.

477
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:03,000
Four times four is sixteen, minus one is fifteen.

478
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:11,000
Four times negative four is negative sixteen, plus seven is negative nine.

479
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:14,000
Alright, so that first column is looking good.

480
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:17,000
Then I move over to the second column, second row.

481
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:26,000
I've got a non-zero value here, so I want a zero out underneath, so I need to work on that sixth there.

482
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:34,000
Okay, so I'm going to multiply row two by three, and add that to row three,

483
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:40,000
because three times two is six, minus six gives me the zero that I need right here.

484
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:50,000
So one, negative three, four, negative four, row two doesn't change.

485
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:55,000
And row three, I get my zero, it's already zero, so three times zero plus zero zero,

486
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:59,000
three times two is six, minus six, there's my new zero.

487
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:05,000
Three times negative five is negative fifteen, plus fifteen is zero.

488
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:14,000
Okay, and remember we're looking at this point, you can see we've got all zeros here.

489
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:19,000
Okay, and then we're ready to get the last position, and what do we have here?

490
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:26,000
Three times four is twelve, minus nine gives us three.

491
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:32,000
So what do we have here? We've got all zeros on the left,

492
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:37,000
and on the right we've got a value that's not zero.

493
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:43,000
So as we saw before, that means this system has no solution.

494
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:53,000
Okay, I want to do one more problem from this section.

495
00:41:53,000 --> 00:42:02,000
And this one is, let's see, actually I'm going to get a couple more.

496
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:09,000
About, let's look at number, let's see, number twenty-two.

497
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:15,000
Okay, twenty-two, twenty-two looks like this.

498
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:24,000
Okay, we put it in the matrix form.

499
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:30,000
Okay, now the directions ask you to find the values of h, this parameter,

500
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:33,000
for which this system is consistent.

501
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:42,000
Okay, so to do that you want to just get an echelon form.

502
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:44,000
Actually we don't know what echelon form is yet.

503
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:46,000
Let's just do what we've been doing.

504
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:53,000
So we've got our non-zero value here, we zero out underneath it, so multiply by three.

505
00:42:53,000 --> 00:43:01,000
So I'm going to do three times row one plus row two, so that gives me a zero there.

506
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:04,000
This doesn't change.

507
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:08,000
Okay, so three times two is six, minus six gives me zero here.

508
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:15,000
Three times negative three is negative nine plus nine gives me zero here.

509
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:22,000
And three times h plus five is just three times h plus five.

510
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:27,000
Alright, now at this point it looks just like the one previous, right?

511
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:30,000
Look back at the one we were just looking at.

512
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:33,000
We had all zeros and then something not zero.

513
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:39,000
Well here we have all zeros, guys, so that's significant.

514
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:50,000
But over here, we don't know what this is because we're asked to find h so that this system is consistent.

515
00:43:50,000 --> 00:44:09,000
So we want this to, we want three h plus five must equal zero for the system to be consistent.

516
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:16,000
Okay, so that means that three h must equal negative five.

517
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:19,000
So h has to equal negative five-thirds.

518
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:22,000
Okay, so that's what we're looking for for this one.

519
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:26,000
Alright, because this has to equal zero for the system to be consistent.

520
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:33,000
Alright, because if this is not zero, we're like this case up here where there's no solution.

521
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:36,000
Alright, let's look at one more.

522
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:43,000
And I'm kind of going out of order here just because I like to kind of stick with the same thing.

523
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:51,000
So I want to back up to number 20 and it's a similar kind of question as 22.

524
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:55,000
But this time the h is not on the right side.

525
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:58,000
It's part of the coefficient matrix.

526
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:00,000
So it's a little bit different.

527
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:04,000
So again, we do our row operation.

528
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:06,000
So we got a non-zero here.

529
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:08,000
We want to zero out this position.

530
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:13,000
So two times row one plus row two.

531
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:18,000
So I've got one h negative three.

532
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:20,000
And I've got zero here.

533
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:24,000
Two times h plus four.

534
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:30,000
And two times negative three is negative six plus six is zero.

535
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:35,000
Alright, so I've got this situation.

536
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:41,000
The problem is to find h such that the system is consistent.

537
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:49,000
Well, system is consistent as long as we don't have a case like we had up here.

538
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:59,000
System is consistent as long as we don't have a row that looks like zero, zero, and then something not zero.

539
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:01,000
Well, notice that that can never happen.

540
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:07,000
We can never have zero, zero, something not zero because the right hand side is already zero.

541
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:28,000
Okay, so that means this system is always consistent.

542
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:48,000
Because we can never have a row of the form zero, zero, and then on the augmented side something not zero.

543
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:53,000
It can't happen in this case because the right hand side is a zero.

544
00:46:53,000 --> 00:47:00,000
So this system is always consistent regardless of what h is.

545
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:04,000
Alright, so I think that's about it for section 1.1.

546
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:14,000
As always, keep in mind that you can call me up, email me anytime to let me know if you have any questions.

547
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:19,000
Alright, good luck with those homework problems.

548
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:24,000
Okay, today we're going to be talking about section 1.2.

549
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:38,000
And really the main thing I want to cover today is to talk about a specific form that we want to get a matrix into when we're trying to solve a system.

550
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:47,000
So we've kind of talked about that a little bit up to now, but at this point we're going to get very specific about that.

551
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:52,000
So the form that we're trying to get at is called echelon form.

552
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:58,000
And echelon form is defined by three properties.

553
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:07,000
So the first one of these is that if there are any rows of all zeros, they're at the bottom of the matrix.

554
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:10,000
So you swap rows to get those at the bottom.

555
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:15,000
The leading entry, remember that's the first non-zero entry.

556
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:23,000
So the leading entry in each row is in a column to the right of the leading entry in the row above it.

557
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:27,000
And I'll show you that in just a sec.

558
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:33,000
Now the third one is that all entries in a column below a leading entry are zeros.

559
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:35,000
So we've done that up to now.

560
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:38,000
You know, we get our leading entry and then we zero out below it.

561
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:41,000
So that's that idea.

562
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:43,000
Here's an example.

563
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:50,000
The black squares here represent non-zero values and they're the leading entries in each of these rows.

564
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:55,000
And so you can see here we have a leading entry and zeros underneath.

565
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:59,000
Here we have another leading entry, zeros underneath.

566
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:03,000
And notice that this leading entry is to the right of the one before it.

567
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:08,000
And here's another leading entry and it's to the right of the one that came before it.

568
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:16,000
Okay, so that second property is basically what gets you the stair step kind of structure in your matrix.

569
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:21,000
All right, see, here's another one.

570
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:24,000
This one's also an echelon form.

571
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:27,000
Leading entry here, zeros below it.

572
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:32,000
Another leading entry, zeros below it and it's to the right of the previous one.

573
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:36,000
And we have a row zeros and it's at the bottom.

574
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:39,000
So we satisfy all the criteria.

575
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:47,000
Now, sometimes you want to go a little bit farther and get your matrix in reduced echelon form.

576
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:54,000
So if it's in reduced echelon form, that means it's an echelon form plus it satisfies two more properties.

577
00:49:54,000 --> 00:50:00,000
Okay, and these properties are that each leading entry is a one.

578
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:04,000
So you scale the rows to make each leading entry equal to one.

579
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:09,000
And that one is the only non-zero entry in its column.

580
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:14,000
So you zero out not only below it, but also above it.

581
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:20,000
So here's an example of a matrix that's in reduced echelon form.

582
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:27,000
Each leading entry is a one and it's the only non-zero entry in its column.

583
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:35,000
So we zeroed out below here, zeroed out above and below and zeroed out above in this case.

584
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:39,000
Alright, here's another one.

585
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:46,000
This one's in reduced echelon form because each leading entry we've only got two and they're each one.

586
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:49,000
And we've zeroed out above and below each one.

587
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:51,000
Zero zeros at the bottom.

588
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:55,000
Okay, so that's in reduced echelon form.

589
00:50:55,000 --> 00:51:02,000
Now for purposes of just solving a system, typically you just want to get it in echelon form.

590
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:10,000
Although there will be one particular case that I'll talk about later in another section coming up

591
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:14,000
where you want to get it in reduced echelon form.

592
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:16,000
It just makes life easier then.

593
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:20,000
But for the most part at this point, echelon form is fine.

594
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:26,000
Now I'll show you a couple of things about these forms.

595
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:32,000
One thing to note is that the reduced echelon form of a matrix is unique.

596
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:38,000
So that means that no matter what sequence or row operations you use to get a matrix in reduced echelon form,

597
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:41,000
you'll end up at the same place.

598
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:44,000
Not so for the echelon form.

599
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:46,000
Okay, it's not unique.

600
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:53,000
It means that all of you could be working on the same matrix and end up with a different echelon form of the same matrix.

601
00:51:53,000 --> 00:52:00,000
And that's because you can scale a row, okay, multiply a row by a constant and get a different echelon form.

602
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:03,000
Still be an echelon form, but it would be a different matrix.

603
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:06,000
Okay, so the reduced form is unique.

604
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:09,000
The echelon form is not.

605
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:16,000
Okay, so you either want to get your matrix in echelon or reduced echelon form when you're solving a system.

606
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:22,000
And the latter, get it in reduced echelon form, takes more work.

607
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:25,000
But when you do that, the solution is obvious.

608
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:28,000
And so let me show you what I mean by that.

609
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:33,000
Here we have an augmented matrix that's already in echelon form.

610
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:36,000
Notice leading entry, zero's underneath.

611
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:38,000
Another leading entry, zero's underneath.

612
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:41,000
And no rows of zero's.

613
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:44,000
Each leading entry is to the right of the one before it.

614
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:47,000
So it's an echelon form.

615
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:54,000
And then we do use back substitution to solve for the variable.

616
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:56,000
So start with the third row.

617
00:52:56,000 --> 00:53:01,000
And equation for the third row, we get seven times x3 equals seven.

618
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:03,000
So we solve for x3.

619
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:08,000
Then we back substitute to solve for x2 in the second row.

620
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:14,000
So second row says negative two times x2 plus five x3 equals seven.

621
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:16,000
And we know that x3 is one.

622
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:17,000
We just solved for that.

623
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:22,000
So we plug that in here and we end up with x2 equals negative one.

624
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:26,000
And then we keep going back up again to the first row.

625
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:32,000
Equation for the first row looks like x1 minus three x2 equals five.

626
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:35,000
And we know what x2 is because we just solved for that.

627
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:39,000
So we plug it in and then we end up with x1 equals two.

628
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:44,000
So that's the method that we were using in section 1.1

629
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:47,000
and probably what you want to continue using for the most part.

630
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:54,000
However, if you choose to get your matrix in reduced echelon form.

631
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:58,000
So this is the same matrix, but in reduced echelon form.

632
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:03,000
Then notice that you end up with the solution values of your variables

633
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:06,000
just sitting in the right hand column.

634
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:11,000
Because if you look at each row, the first row says one times x1 equals two.

635
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:15,000
Second row, one times x2 equals negative one and so forth.

636
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:21,000
So if you go back up, you can see we got x1 is two, x2 negative one, one.

637
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:23,000
So two negative one, one.

638
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:25,000
And there's two negative one, one.

639
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:29,000
So that's one advantage of getting it in reduced echelon form.

640
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:34,000
Because then the solution is obvious and you don't have to actually do any back substitution.

641
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:43,000
So it's kind of your mileage may vary, whichever you like will be fine.

642
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:50,000
And at this point we'll stop here and we'll pick up here in the next video.

643
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:54,000
Okay, so picking up from the previous video.

644
00:54:54,000 --> 00:55:00,000
Let's talk a little bit about a couple more pieces of terminology

645
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:04,000
that we'll be using extensively throughout the course.

646
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:12,000
Okay, so remember the leading entry is the first non-zero entry in a row

647
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:15,000
in a matrix in echelon form.

648
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:22,000
So it turns out that the leading entries in the reduced echelon form

649
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:29,000
and in any echelon form are in the same positions, I mean the same location in the matrix.

650
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:32,000
So here's the one we're just looking at.

651
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:39,000
There's a leading entry in the 1, 1 first row, first column, second row, second column, third row, third column.

652
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:44,000
And in the reduced echelon form, same positions in the matrix.

653
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:49,000
So it's convenient to talk about those positions as opposed to the actual value.

654
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:55,000
The leading entry is the actual value, but we really are more interested in the position.

655
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:57,000
And so we call that a pivot position.

656
00:55:57,000 --> 00:56:02,000
So a pivot position is a position that contains a leading entry.

657
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:10,000
So the 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3 positions would be pivot positions in this matrix.

658
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:15,000
Okay, so as I said, the leading entry is the actual value, the pivot position is the location.

659
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:19,000
So the leading entry here is 1, it's in the first row, first column.

660
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:21,000
So that's the pivot position.

661
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:28,000
Here, this row, the leading entry is negative 2, it's in the second row, second column position.

662
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:34,000
Okay, and then one other term is pivot column.

663
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:38,000
Pivot column is a column that contains a pivot position.

664
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:44,000
So I'll be using the terms pivot position and pivot column until probably the last day of the semester.

665
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:50,000
So you will hear that quite a bit to make sure you understand what those are.

666
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:52,000
Okay, two more terms.

667
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:58,000
A basic variable is one that corresponds to a pivot column.

668
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:03,000
And a free variable is one that corresponds to a non-pivot column.

669
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:14,000
Okay, so for each column, except for the augmented column, there's a corresponding variable.

670
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:21,000
So if you look and there's a pivot column, that means that variable is basic.

671
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:26,000
If the column is not a pivot column, that means that variable is called free.

672
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:34,000
Okay, so let's look at how all this relates to solving the system of equation.

673
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:37,000
So I've got a tail of three matrices.

674
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:39,000
Here's number one.

675
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:43,000
Now notice this matrix.

676
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:46,000
It's already an echelon form, right?

677
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:51,000
Here's leading entry, zero's underneath, leading entry, zero's underneath, leading entry.

678
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:54,000
You don't need to worry about zero's underneath yet.

679
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:58,000
So we start the process of solving the system.

680
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:00,000
So we start with row three.

681
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:03,000
And here's the equation that corresponds to row three.

682
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:07,000
And if I simplify the left side, it's just zero.

683
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:12,000
So when it was zero equals seven, well, we know that can't happen.

684
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:19,000
So that is our clue that this system has no solution.

685
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:25,000
So if the echelon form of an augmented matrix has a row of this form,

686
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:34,000
where on the left you've got all zeros, then in the augmented column you have something not zero.

687
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:37,000
So all zeros on the left, not zero on the right.

688
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:38,000
That's what we have here.

689
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:42,000
All zeros on the left, not zero on the right.

690
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:45,000
Then the corresponding system has no solution.

691
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:47,000
Okay, so that's the marker.

692
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:53,000
That's what you need to look for to see if your system is consistent or not.

693
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:56,000
All right, matrix number two.

694
00:58:56,000 --> 00:59:01,000
Change that first one just a little bit and I put a non-zero value here.

695
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:10,000
And so we've got leading entry, zero's underneath, leading entry, zero's underneath, another leading entry.

696
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:12,000
So this one's in echelon form.

697
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:18,000
So we solve, and this is the same one we solved earlier, so I'm not going to go back through that.

698
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:21,000
And this was our solution.

699
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:24,000
And so this one, what?

700
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:26,000
Has a unique solution.

701
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:28,000
The system is consistent.

702
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:34,000
It's consistent because it doesn't have a row where there's all zeros and then something not zero.

703
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:37,000
And it has no free variables.

704
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:39,000
That's the key here for unique solution.

705
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:46,000
Notice that there's a pivot position in every column of the coefficient part of the matrix.

706
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:50,000
So pivot position in column one, so x1 is basic.

707
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:53,000
Pivot position in column two, so x2 is basic.

708
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:57,000
Pivot position in column three, so x3 is basic.

709
00:59:57,000 --> 00:59:59,000
So system is consistent.

710
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:03,000
All the variables are basic.

711
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:08,000
It has no free variables, and so we get a unique solution.

712
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:12,000
Alright, one more matrix.

713
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:16,000
Notice here that we've got a row of all zeros.

714
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:21,000
This one is in echelon form, but we've got a row of all zeros.

715
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:23,000
Let's look for just a second.

716
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:26,000
x1 here has a pivot position.

717
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:29,000
The column two has a pivot position.

718
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:32,000
Column three does not have a pivot position.

719
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:35,000
So that means that we have a free variable.

720
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:38,000
x1 and x2 are basic, but x3 is a free variable

721
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:43,000
because there's no pivot position in column three.

722
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:48,000
So if we try to solve it, here's what we get from row two.

723
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:51,000
Negative two x2 plus five x3 equals seven.

724
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:56,000
We solve for x2, and notice that it's written in terms of x3.

725
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:59,000
And then we back up to row one,

726
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:03,000
and that x1 minus three x2 equals five.

727
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:08,000
We substitute in for x2, and here's what we end up with for x1.

728
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:12,000
Notice it's also written in terms of x3.

729
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:15,000
Notice that that's all we've got, these two equations,

730
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:18,000
and so there's nothing constraining x3,

731
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:21,000
and that's because x3 is a free variable.

732
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:25,000
And so if we write our solution, here's what it looks like.

733
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:30,000
And in your book, that's what they call the general form of the solution.

734
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:36,000
So this is just for x1, x2, what we just computed, x3 is free.

735
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:40,000
This is the general form of the solution.

736
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:45,000
So notice that we can plug in any value for x3 that we want,

737
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:49,000
and any value that x3 produces a different solution.

738
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:54,000
So that means we have an infinite number of solutions to this system.

739
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:59,000
The easiest thing, if you want a specific solution,

740
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:02,000
the easiest thing is to just plug in zero for x3.

741
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:06,000
If you do that, then you get x1's negative eleven-halves,

742
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:10,000
x2 negative seven-halves, x3 is zero.

743
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:17,000
Or you could plug in x3 equals one and get another solution.

744
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:20,000
I always tell my students, plug in your favorite number.

745
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:23,000
So if your favorite number is pi, plug in pi for x3.

746
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:28,000
And if you do that, then here's what you get for x1 and x2.

747
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:35,000
So no matter what value of x3 you plug in, that generates a different solution,

748
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:38,000
and so you have an infinite number of solutions.

749
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:44,000
And so the bottom line is that if the system is consistent,

750
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:47,000
and that's a key, you've got to make sure it's consistent to start with,

751
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:50,000
and has at least one free variable,

752
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:55,000
then you will have an infinite number of solutions.

753
01:02:55,000 --> 01:02:58,000
So let's recap.

754
01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:01,000
When you're solving a system of equations,

755
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:07,000
number one, put the augmented matrix in echelon form.

756
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:12,000
Number two, if you have a row of this form,

757
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:16,000
and this form is, again, all zeros on the left,

758
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:20,000
something not zero in the augmented column,

759
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:25,000
then that means the corresponding system has no solution.

760
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:28,000
At that point, stop because you've got no solution.

761
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:32,000
If that's not the case, then that means the system is consistent.

762
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:36,000
So at that point, you look to see if there are free variables or not.

763
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:43,000
If there are no free variables, that means the system has a unique solution.

764
01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:47,000
If it's consistent and there's at least one free variable,

765
01:03:47,000 --> 01:03:50,000
then you have an infinite number of solutions.

766
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:56,000
So that's really your algorithm there for how to determine,

767
01:03:56,000 --> 01:04:00,000
how to solve a system and determine which case it is.

768
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:01,000
Is it no solution?

769
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:05,000
Is it a unique solution or an infinite number of solutions?

770
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:12,000
Okay, and that is it for this video.

771
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:18,000
All right, we're going to start here with a graphical look at vectors.

772
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:24,000
So we've kind of seen, we've played around with matrices and augmented matrices

773
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:26,000
and solving systems.

774
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:32,000
But let's take a look at vectors from a graphical point of view.

775
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:38,000
Before we do that, though, we need to discuss some terminologies.

776
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:40,000
We'll start with Rn.

777
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:45,000
So you've seen this symbol, the fancy looking R.

778
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:48,000
That stands for the real numbers.

779
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:55,000
And when you see a superscript, like here with an N, excuse me,

780
01:04:55,000 --> 01:05:00,000
that indicates that you're talking about vectors.

781
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:05,000
And so this, as I say here, you just read this as Rn.

782
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:12,000
Okay, so Rn is the set of all vectors having N components or N elements,

783
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:14,000
each of which is a real number.

784
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:20,000
So from a set point of view, you can look at it like this, set notation.

785
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:27,000
All vectors look like this N components, where each one of them is a real number.

786
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:31,000
A lot of times we'll just talk about R2.

787
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:35,000
Excuse me.

788
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:39,000
In R2, the two indicates vectors with two components.

789
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:40,000
So there you go.

790
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:43,000
And there's R3, similar sort of thing.

791
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:47,000
We've got three components where each one is a real number.

792
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:51,000
So for example, here are three vectors in R2.

793
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:55,000
You know they're in R2 because they're vectors with two components.

794
01:05:55,000 --> 01:05:58,000
Each component's a real number.

795
01:05:58,000 --> 01:06:04,000
And here they're vectors in R3 because they have three components.

796
01:06:07,000 --> 01:06:12,000
There are two operations that we need to know how to perform on vectors.

797
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:15,000
The first of these is addition of vectors.

798
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:21,000
So if we have two vectors, X and Y, and Rn, then we can compute their sum.

799
01:06:21,000 --> 01:06:26,000
As indicated here, okay, here's X, here's Y, both have N components.

800
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:32,000
To compute their sum, you just add components that are in the same position.

801
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:38,000
So first position X1 plus Y1 gives you the first position in the sum.

802
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:43,000
Then X2 plus Y2 and so forth to Xn plus Yn.

803
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:50,000
So for example, if here's X and here's Y, to get their sum, 0 plus 2 gives you the 2 here.

804
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:56,000
1 plus 4, 5, and negative 3 plus negative 2 gives you negative 5.

805
01:06:56,000 --> 01:07:03,000
The other operation that we need to know how to perform on vectors is scalar multiplication.

806
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:07,000
Excuse me again.

807
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:18,000
Scalar multiplication of vectors is based on the idea that you have a scalar,

808
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:24,000
which is just a real number, a single number, that you want to multiply by a vector.

809
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:27,000
And so the way you do that is indicated here.

810
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:30,000
You just multiply that number by each element in the vector.

811
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:34,000
So we get CX1, CX2, down to CXn.

812
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:39,000
So for example, here's your X.

813
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:44,000
You want to multiply 4 times X, then you just multiply each component in the vector by 4.

814
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:56,000
Okay, now with that, we can start to talk about a graphical representation of vectors and we'll restrict our attention at first, at least to R2.

815
01:07:56,000 --> 01:08:00,000
Pardon me.

816
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:08,000
A vector in R2, also called the plane, and you're probably familiar with that terminology,

817
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:17,000
is indicated by a ray that begins at the origin and terminates at the point defined by the vector.

818
01:08:17,000 --> 01:08:23,000
So here's a couple of vectors and you can see how they look on a graph.

819
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:34,000
Okay, so U is 2, 1, so we have a ray that begins at 0, 0, and terminates at 2, 1, similarly for V.

820
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:40,000
Analytically, we know we can compute U plus V in this fashion.

821
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:45,000
Just sum the like terms, 2 plus 1, 1 plus 4, give you 3, 5.

822
01:08:45,000 --> 01:08:50,000
Graphically, we use the parallelogram method.

823
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:58,000
You might be familiar with this from your physics class or engineering or maybe even like Calc 3 if you had that.

824
01:08:59,000 --> 01:09:08,000
So the way that works is you go to the end of one of the vectors and you draw a line that's parallel to the other one.

825
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:14,000
Okay, so this line here would be parallel to V, and we do the same thing for the other vectors.

826
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:21,000
So go to the end of V, draw a line that's parallel to U, and this line is parallel to U.

827
01:09:21,000 --> 01:09:28,000
And where those two lines intersect, that is the sum of the two vectors.

828
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:34,000
So this vector here would be U plus V, and you can see that it's at 3, 5.

829
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:42,000
Scalar multiple of a vector.

830
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:45,000
I did a couple of examples based on those.

831
01:09:45,000 --> 01:09:51,000
We were just looking at it, 3 times 2, 1 is just 6, 3, and here's a half of V.

832
01:09:51,000 --> 01:10:02,000
If you look at that graphically, 3 times U is a vector that's in the same direction as U, and it's just 3 times as long.

833
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:11,000
So basically you got 3 U's stacked there, and so you can see that it corresponds to there's 6, 3.

834
01:10:11,000 --> 01:10:17,000
And one half of V is what you think, one half of V.

835
01:10:17,000 --> 01:10:24,000
So you can see that it's a vector in the same direction as V, but half the length.

836
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:27,000
We can add those two together.

837
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:31,000
So this is how we do it, 3 times U plus a half V.

838
01:10:31,000 --> 01:10:33,000
We already know how to do these operations.

839
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:45,000
And graphically, take our one half V, align parallel to 3 U, do similarly over here.

840
01:10:45,000 --> 01:10:53,000
And the resultant vector here is what we think it should be, about 13 halves, 5.

841
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:58,000
So notice that you can scale U to whatever length you want.

842
01:10:58,000 --> 01:11:04,000
You can scale V to whatever length you want, and then add those two vectors together.

843
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:09,000
And if you do that, then think about where the vectors would end up.

844
01:11:09,000 --> 01:11:16,000
Any vectors that you can scale U however you want, scale V however you want, and then add them together.

845
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:20,000
And let's think about that.

846
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:25,000
So this would be any multiple of U, any multiple of V.

847
01:11:25,000 --> 01:11:32,000
And for the moment, let's restrict our attention to positive multiples or non-negative multiples.

848
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:36,000
So let's assume that C and D are both non-negative.

849
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:47,000
If we do that, then the vectors that we can produce or generate are here in this cone defined by U and V.

850
01:11:47,000 --> 01:11:54,000
Because again, we can scale U to whatever length we want, we can scale V to whatever length we want,

851
01:11:54,000 --> 01:12:02,000
and then when we complete the parallelogram, then we can end up with any vector in this cone area here.

852
01:12:03,000 --> 01:12:15,000
If you allow yourself to take negative multiples of U and V, then think about where those vectors would be in the plane.

853
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:22,000
The easiest way I think to think about this is to, instead of thinking about taking negative multiples of U and V,

854
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:28,000
about thinking of it as taking positive multiples of negative U and negative V.

855
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:35,000
And if you do that, then it's a similar thing as what you just saw.

856
01:12:35,000 --> 01:12:46,000
So here is negative V, here's negative U, and so when you take positive multiples of U and V,

857
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:53,000
or positive multiples of negative U and negative V, and then add those two vectors together,

858
01:12:53,000 --> 01:12:59,000
you end up with vectors in this region here.

859
01:12:59,000 --> 01:13:11,000
Okay, so other possibilities for C and D, let's think about that.

860
01:13:11,000 --> 01:13:22,000
If we allow positive multiples of U and negative multiples of V, then we're in this yellow region here.

861
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:29,000
And if we allow positive multiples of V but negative multiples of U, then we're in this region here.

862
01:13:29,000 --> 01:13:43,000
And so what you see is that we can generate any vector in the plane that we'd like just by taking a multiple of U and a multiple of V and adding them together.

863
01:13:43,000 --> 01:13:50,000
Okay, so we're going to see in a little bit that this means that U and V span the plane.

864
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:57,000
So we can take multiples of each one of those and add them together and generate any vector in the plane.

865
01:13:57,000 --> 01:14:01,000
That's what it means to span R2.

866
01:14:01,000 --> 01:14:07,000
All right, so I'm going to stop here for now and we'll pick up this in our next.

867
01:14:07,000 --> 01:14:11,000
Okay, we're back where we left off with the first video.

868
01:14:11,000 --> 01:14:19,000
And we were looking at this picture where we determined that based on our vectors U and V here,

869
01:14:19,000 --> 01:14:28,000
we could take multiples of each one of those and add them together to produce any vector in the plane.

870
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:41,000
So any vector in R2 or the plane can be written in the form C times U plus D times V for some values of C and D.

871
01:14:41,000 --> 01:14:44,000
Let's look at that analytically now.

872
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:50,000
Okay, so according to our graphical argument, this system is consistent for every B in R2.

873
01:14:50,000 --> 01:14:57,000
You can take some multiple of U, some multiple of V, add them together and get any vector in R2.

874
01:14:57,000 --> 01:15:06,000
So if we break that down, we can multiply C times U. This is U. This is V.

875
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:09,000
There's our generic right-hand side vector.

876
01:15:09,000 --> 01:15:13,000
We multiply it through by the scalars. We end up with this.

877
01:15:13,000 --> 01:15:18,000
And then adding these two together gives us this matrix here.

878
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:21,000
Now, what does it mean for two vectors to be equal?

879
01:15:21,000 --> 01:15:25,000
Well, it means that component-wise they're equal.

880
01:15:25,000 --> 01:15:29,000
So the first component here is equal to the first component here.

881
01:15:29,000 --> 01:15:32,000
And likewise the second component.

882
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:34,000
So what we have is a system of equations.

883
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:39,000
2C plus D equals B1. C plus 4D equals B2.

884
01:15:39,000 --> 01:15:42,000
So we can put that in an augmented matrix.

885
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:45,000
And that's what I've got here.

886
01:15:45,000 --> 01:15:53,000
And notice that, again, according to our graphical argument, our picture that we looked at,

887
01:15:53,000 --> 01:16:00,000
this system corresponding to this augmented matrix is consistent no matter what B1 and B2 are.

888
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:04,000
And also notice that these are equivalent.

889
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:13,000
So when we have a multiple of a vector plus another multiple of a vector, then equals some right-hand side vector.

890
01:16:13,000 --> 01:16:17,000
Notice how this system relates to this augmented matrix.

891
01:16:17,000 --> 01:16:20,000
So the first vector here just goes in the first column.

892
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:22,000
The second vector goes in the second column.

893
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:24,000
And the right-hand side is just in the right-hand side column.

894
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:29,000
So these are equivalent.

895
01:16:29,000 --> 01:16:33,000
Okay, let's look at this system a little more closely.

896
01:16:33,000 --> 01:16:40,000
I swapped rows to make the arithmetic a little easier to get the 1 and the pivot position here.

897
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:43,000
We can do a row operation to zero out underneath.

898
01:16:43,000 --> 01:16:45,000
And we end up with this matrix.

899
01:16:45,000 --> 01:16:50,000
Now remember, this has a solution no matter what the right-hand side is.

900
01:16:50,000 --> 01:16:53,000
Okay, now how do we know that that's the case?

901
01:16:53,000 --> 01:16:58,000
We know it graphically, but how can we look at this augmented matrix and tell that?

902
01:16:58,000 --> 01:17:02,000
Well, notice that there's no way to have a row of this form.

903
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:05,000
Zero, zero, something not zero form.

904
01:17:05,000 --> 01:17:09,000
And that's because in each row, we have a pivot position.

905
01:17:09,000 --> 01:17:13,000
There's a pivot position here, so that's never going to be zero.

906
01:17:13,000 --> 01:17:16,000
There's a pivot position here, so that's never going to be zero.

907
01:17:16,000 --> 01:17:22,000
So there's no way to have a row of this form here.

908
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:30,000
Okay, so the bottom line is that your system will be consistent no matter what the right-hand side is

909
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:35,000
if you have a pivot position in every row of the coefficient matrix.

910
01:17:35,000 --> 01:17:41,000
Okay, now I'm going to talk about the coefficient matrix because I'm talking about just this part here.

911
01:17:41,000 --> 01:17:43,000
Not looking at the right-hand side.

912
01:17:43,000 --> 01:17:51,000
You don't want your right-hand side to have a pivot position because then that would indicate the system's inconsistent.

913
01:17:52,000 --> 01:18:06,000
Alright, let's kind of take what we've looked at so far and put it in the terminology of the text.

914
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:16,000
Okay, so if we start off with an arbitrary set of vectors v1 through vp and scalars c1 through cp,

915
01:18:16,000 --> 01:18:25,000
then if we apply the scalars to the vectors and add them up, and that's what we were doing earlier,

916
01:18:25,000 --> 01:18:29,000
we only had two vectors, but here we've got an arbitrary number of vectors,

917
01:18:29,000 --> 01:18:37,000
this is called a linear combination of the v's with weights c1 through cp.

918
01:18:37,000 --> 01:18:47,000
Okay, so when we've been multiplying by scalar and adding vectors together, we were taking linear combinations.

919
01:18:47,000 --> 01:18:50,000
Okay, so a linear combination just looks like this.

920
01:18:50,000 --> 01:18:59,000
You've got a scalar multiplied times a vector, and you have that for however many vectors you have, and then you add them all up.

921
01:18:59,000 --> 01:19:03,000
That's what a linear combination is.

922
01:19:03,000 --> 01:19:06,000
Okay, so we were doing c times u plus v times v.

923
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:14,000
That was a linear combination of u and v where c and d were the weights we were using.

924
01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:17,000
Okay, now here's a linear combination.

925
01:19:17,000 --> 01:19:22,000
Here the x's are being the weights and the a's are vectors.

926
01:19:22,000 --> 01:19:28,000
Okay, so this is x1a1 plus x2a2 and so forth.

927
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:42,000
Oh, that should be xn an, and that has the same solution set as the system given by this augmented matrix.

928
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:49,000
Now if you remember before, we started off with an equation like this, we just had two vectors,

929
01:19:49,000 --> 01:19:55,000
but then when we got it into matrix form, remember I showed you, you take your first vector here,

930
01:19:55,000 --> 01:19:58,000
it goes in the first column in the augmented matrix.

931
01:19:58,000 --> 01:20:01,000
The second vector goes in the second column and so forth.

932
01:20:01,000 --> 01:20:08,000
The last vector goes in the last column and then you've got your right hand side.

933
01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:16,000
Here we see that we've got u ended up c times u plus d times v,

934
01:20:16,000 --> 01:20:22,000
and we ended up with that augmented matrix that we saw earlier.

935
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:33,000
Okay, one more term, and I used this in the previous video, but we'll define it more formally here.

936
01:20:33,000 --> 01:20:45,000
The set of all linear combinations of the set of vectors v1 through vp in Rn is denoted by the span of v1 through vp.

937
01:20:45,000 --> 01:20:52,000
Okay, so set of all linear combinations of vectors is the span of that set of vectors.

938
01:20:52,000 --> 01:21:02,000
And the span of that set of vectors is just called the subset that is spanned or generated by those vectors.

939
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:15,000
So if you recall back when we were looking at our example, I talked about how you could span my two vectors,

940
01:21:15,000 --> 01:21:18,000
u and v, that we had, they spanned R2.

941
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:21,000
We're going to look at that in just a sec.

942
01:21:21,000 --> 01:21:23,000
Here's another way of looking at it.

943
01:21:23,000 --> 01:21:27,000
The span of v1 through vp is all vectors that can be written in this form.

944
01:21:27,000 --> 01:21:28,000
What is this form?

945
01:21:28,000 --> 01:21:30,000
It's just linear combinations.

946
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:36,000
Okay, so the span is just a set of all linear combinations of those vectors.

947
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:39,000
And here's the previous example.

948
01:21:39,000 --> 01:21:47,000
We've got c times, this is u, plus d times v equals v1, v2.

949
01:21:47,000 --> 01:21:56,000
Okay, so that means that these vectors span R2.

950
01:21:56,000 --> 01:21:58,000
Let's back up just a little bit.

951
01:21:58,000 --> 01:22:02,000
What if we just looked at the span of a single vector?

952
01:22:02,000 --> 01:22:04,000
What would we get there?

953
01:22:04,000 --> 01:22:09,000
Well, back to the definition, all linear combinations of that vector,

954
01:22:09,000 --> 01:22:15,000
and linear combinations of just one vector means just all multiples of that vector.

955
01:22:15,000 --> 01:22:23,000
And so graphically what that is is just the line that goes through the origin and that vector.

956
01:22:23,000 --> 01:22:25,000
It's just all multiples of u.

957
01:22:25,000 --> 01:22:30,000
So anything on this line.

958
01:22:30,000 --> 01:22:33,000
Here's another thing to think about.

959
01:22:33,000 --> 01:22:40,000
The span of the vector 2, 1 is the same as the span of this set of vectors.

960
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:43,000
Now why would that be?

961
01:22:43,000 --> 01:22:46,000
Well, here's definition.

962
01:22:46,000 --> 01:22:50,000
A span of 2, 1 is just all multiples of 2, 1.

963
01:22:50,000 --> 01:22:56,000
The span of the 2 of them is all linear combinations of the 2.

964
01:22:56,000 --> 01:23:01,000
Now why would these 2 sets be the same?

965
01:23:01,000 --> 01:23:06,000
Well, the key is to notice that 4, 2 is a multiple of 2, 1.

966
01:23:06,000 --> 01:23:11,000
So it really doesn't add anything because you can take a multiple of 2, 1 to get 4, 2.

967
01:23:11,000 --> 01:23:19,000
So by adding 4, 2 to the set as I did here, it doesn't get you any more vectors.

968
01:23:20,000 --> 01:23:28,000
And so you have to move off that line defined by the vector 2, 1 to generate more vectors.

969
01:23:28,000 --> 01:23:34,000
And that's in our example before we had 2 vectors that were not collinear.

970
01:23:34,000 --> 01:23:41,000
And so in that case, you could generate or span all of our 2.

971
01:23:41,000 --> 01:23:46,000
Okay, let's look a little bit at a three-dimensional example.

972
01:23:46,000 --> 01:23:56,000
So if we look at the span of this vector, that would just be all multiples of that vector in graphically.

973
01:23:56,000 --> 01:24:05,000
We're saying that x has to be 0, z has to be 0, but y could be anything because you can multiply anything by 1.

974
01:24:05,000 --> 01:24:09,000
So essentially you're on the y-axis.

975
01:24:09,000 --> 01:24:17,000
So x has to be 0, z has to be 0, so anything along the y-axis.

976
01:24:17,000 --> 01:24:24,000
If we add another vector to it, so I throw in this one, now we take all linear combinations of these two

977
01:24:24,000 --> 01:24:30,000
and notice that in this case, you get all vectors that look like this.

978
01:24:30,000 --> 01:24:35,000
So it means x has to be 0, but y and z can be anything we want them to be.

979
01:24:35,000 --> 01:24:46,000
And so that gives us a plane where x is 0, but y and z are anything that we want them to be.

980
01:24:46,000 --> 01:24:56,000
So these two vectors in our 3 generate a plane.

981
01:24:56,000 --> 01:25:04,000
We're going to start off today talking about multiplying a matrix with a vector.

982
01:25:04,000 --> 01:25:12,000
So some terminology there, let's suppose that we start off with an M by N matrix A

983
01:25:12,000 --> 01:25:19,000
and we're going to let A1, A2 through AN be the columns of A.

984
01:25:19,000 --> 01:25:25,000
So each of these is a column vector and not a scalar.

985
01:25:25,000 --> 01:25:37,000
Each A sub i is a vector in our M. Since there are M rows in A, each column would have M entries.

986
01:25:37,000 --> 01:25:42,000
And let's let x be a vector in our N.

987
01:25:42,000 --> 01:25:48,000
Then the product of A and x is computed as shown here.

988
01:25:48,000 --> 01:25:55,000
So here's A. Remember each of these is a vector, a column of A. Here's x.

989
01:25:55,000 --> 01:26:04,000
And so to compute A times x, basically we just match up the components of x with the columns of A.

990
01:26:04,000 --> 01:26:11,000
So we end up with x1 times A1 plus x2 times A2 plus out to xN times AN.

991
01:26:11,000 --> 01:26:20,000
You'll recognize this as a linear combination of the columns of A.

992
01:26:20,000 --> 01:26:30,000
So here's the deal. Ax is a linear combination of the columns of A using the corresponding entries in x as the weight.

993
01:26:30,000 --> 01:26:35,000
So here's an example. Here's a matrix A and a vector x.

994
01:26:35,000 --> 01:26:46,000
Then to compute A times x, we've got the first entry in x times the first column of A plus the second entry in x times the second column of A.

995
01:26:46,000 --> 01:26:51,000
And then plus the third entry in x times the third column of A.

996
01:26:51,000 --> 01:27:00,000
And we do the scalar multiplication, add them together, and here's our result.

997
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:08,000
Alright, so notice what we have. Here's a matrix times a vector, and we get this vector.

998
01:27:08,000 --> 01:27:20,000
Or another way of looking at it. Here's a linear combination of the columns of the matrix, yielding the same vector, clearly.

999
01:27:20,000 --> 01:27:24,000
And then here's another way to look at it.

1000
01:27:24,000 --> 01:27:40,000
If we looked at this augmented matrix, this is A here, the coefficient matrix A, with this vector augmented onto the right hand side.

1001
01:27:40,000 --> 01:27:49,000
We essentially have the augmented matrix here that corresponds to this system.

1002
01:27:49,000 --> 01:27:56,000
So if we put it in reduced echelon form, which I have here, notice that we get what we think we should get, right?

1003
01:27:56,000 --> 01:28:02,000
The solution to the system is just the vector x that we started out with up here.

1004
01:28:02,000 --> 01:28:08,000
So these are three different ways to look at the same system.

1005
01:28:09,000 --> 01:28:13,000
So let's formalize that idea.

1006
01:28:13,000 --> 01:28:27,000
So if we have a matrix A that's m by n with columns A1, A2, to An, and if B is a vector in RM,

1007
01:28:27,000 --> 01:28:36,000
then these equations, Ax equals B, and this linear combination of the columns of A, set equal to B.

1008
01:28:36,000 --> 01:28:44,000
In the system corresponding to this augmented matrix, where you've got all the columns of A with B tacked on at the augmented column,

1009
01:28:44,000 --> 01:28:47,000
all have the same solution set.

1010
01:28:47,000 --> 01:28:50,000
So these all essentially mean the same thing.

1011
01:28:50,000 --> 01:28:56,000
They're just different ways of looking at the same problem.

1012
01:28:56,000 --> 01:29:05,000
So notice that the equation Ax equals B as a solution, f and only if B is a linear combination of the columns of A.

1013
01:29:05,000 --> 01:29:11,000
Since these are all equivalent, this is a linear combination of the columns of A that we're setting equal to B.

1014
01:29:11,000 --> 01:29:17,000
So if that has a solution, that means Ax equals B has a solution.

1015
01:29:17,000 --> 01:29:28,000
And another way of stating that is that Ax equals B has a solution if and only if B is in the span of the columns of A.

1016
01:29:28,000 --> 01:29:38,000
So if B is a linear combination of the columns of A, that means B is in the span of the columns of A.

1017
01:29:38,000 --> 01:29:54,000
We're going to move over to a maple session at this point because it's easier to show you some of this with some of the graphics that maple lets me use.

1018
01:29:54,000 --> 01:30:04,000
And so I'll also give you a little lesson in using maple as well.

1019
01:30:04,000 --> 01:30:15,000
So I'm loading here the student linear algebra package and the plots package.

1020
01:30:15,000 --> 01:30:22,000
And then I'm defining two vectors here, A1 and A2.

1021
01:30:22,000 --> 01:30:32,000
And then I'm creating with this command a matrix A whose columns are the vectors A1 and A2.

1022
01:30:32,000 --> 01:30:37,000
So you see the output that you get from that.

1023
01:30:37,000 --> 01:30:44,000
I'm defining these vectors because I want to look at the plane that they lie on.

1024
01:30:44,000 --> 01:30:57,000
And as I explained here, this plane is defined by this equation x minus y equals zero.

1025
01:30:57,000 --> 01:31:07,000
So notice that both of my vectors here have x minus y equals zero and z can be essentially whatever it wants to be.

1026
01:31:07,000 --> 01:31:15,000
And so what that amounts to is a plane that if you think about the line y equals x in the plane.

1027
01:31:15,000 --> 01:31:21,000
So it's kind of defined by that line and then just straight up and straight down from that line.

1028
01:31:21,000 --> 01:31:27,000
So let's kind of look at a picture here.

1029
01:31:27,000 --> 01:31:32,000
I'm defining plots so that we can see what these look like.

1030
01:31:33,000 --> 01:31:40,000
Okay, so let's see.

1031
01:31:40,000 --> 01:31:46,000
It looks like I've changed this.

1032
01:31:46,000 --> 01:31:50,000
Let me change this.

1033
01:31:50,000 --> 01:31:52,000
This is supposed to be 222.

1034
01:31:52,000 --> 01:31:54,000
It really doesn't matter.

1035
01:31:54,000 --> 01:31:57,000
But just to be consistent, let me make that change.

1036
01:31:57,000 --> 01:32:04,000
Okay, then so here's what those two vectors look like.

1037
01:32:04,000 --> 01:32:10,000
And let me kind of rotate this to make it look like what I want.

1038
01:32:10,000 --> 01:32:20,000
Basically, if you look, you can kind of see that they lie on the same plane.

1039
01:32:20,000 --> 01:32:29,000
And that plane is, if you look at it, this is looking down from the z perspective.

1040
01:32:29,000 --> 01:32:36,000
And so that's, if you look down at the bottom of that box, that's the line y equals x.

1041
01:32:36,000 --> 01:32:41,000
So they both lie on that line.

1042
01:32:41,000 --> 01:32:48,000
It's easier if you look at the plane also and then you can see the vectors as well.

1043
01:32:48,000 --> 01:32:52,000
So let's do that.

1044
01:32:52,000 --> 01:32:57,000
Here you can see the plane.

1045
01:32:57,000 --> 01:33:03,000
And you've got the two vectors that are lying on that plane.

1046
01:33:03,000 --> 01:33:09,000
Okay, so you can see here's the x-axis this way, y going this way, and z's up and down.

1047
01:33:09,000 --> 01:33:11,000
And you can see there's the plane.

1048
01:33:11,000 --> 01:33:17,000
And looking from it from up above, you can see that we're cutting across

1049
01:33:17,000 --> 01:33:20,000
on the line y equals x.

1050
01:33:20,000 --> 01:33:26,000
And both those vectors lie in that plane.

1051
01:33:26,000 --> 01:33:34,000
So if we look at any other vector in that plane,

1052
01:33:34,000 --> 01:33:40,000
any other vector where the x and y components are the same, it should lie on that plane.

1053
01:33:40,000 --> 01:33:45,000
So I've defined a new vector, a 113.

1054
01:33:45,000 --> 01:33:52,000
And then I've plotted it on this same set of axes.

1055
01:33:52,000 --> 01:33:59,000
And so if you look, let's get it like this.

1056
01:33:59,000 --> 01:34:04,000
There you can see the new 1113.

1057
01:34:04,000 --> 01:34:07,000
I made it black so you can see it here.

1058
01:34:07,000 --> 01:34:15,000
And then looking at it from above again, you can see that those are all on the same set of axes, or same plane.

1059
01:34:15,000 --> 01:34:18,000
So all those lie on the same plane.

1060
01:34:18,000 --> 01:34:27,000
So that means that b here is in the span of the original two vectors that we started out with.

1061
01:34:27,000 --> 01:34:31,000
Or it's a linear combination of the two vectors we started out with.

1062
01:34:31,000 --> 01:34:37,000
So if we solve the system ax equals b, it should be consistent.

1063
01:34:37,000 --> 01:34:39,000
So that's what I'm doing right here.

1064
01:34:39,000 --> 01:34:44,000
I'm forming the matrix, an augmented matrix here.

1065
01:34:44,000 --> 01:34:51,000
So I've got my matrix a, and then I'm augmenting on the new vector b here.

1066
01:34:51,000 --> 01:35:00,000
And all in the same command, I'm reducing that matrix to echelon form, or row echelon form.

1067
01:35:01,000 --> 01:35:04,000
And here's what we get.

1068
01:35:04,000 --> 01:35:13,000
Clearly, this system has a solution because we have no rows where it's all zeros and then something not zero.

1069
01:35:13,000 --> 01:35:16,000
You can see we've got a row of all zeros, but that's okay.

1070
01:35:16,000 --> 01:35:21,000
And in fact, we have a unique solution because there's no free variables.

1071
01:35:21,000 --> 01:35:30,000
And the solution says that x1 is 3 halves, x2 is negative one.

1072
01:35:30,000 --> 01:35:39,000
So if we take that linear combination, 3 halves times the first column of a, plus negative one times the second column of a,

1073
01:35:39,000 --> 01:35:44,000
we should get b because that's the system we just solved.

1074
01:35:44,000 --> 01:35:51,000
If you look, indeed, this is that linear combination here, and this is b.

1075
01:35:51,000 --> 01:35:53,000
All right.

1076
01:35:53,000 --> 01:36:02,000
Now looking ahead, if we choose a vector whose first components are not equal, then it should not be on that plane.

1077
01:36:02,000 --> 01:36:07,000
And if we solve the system with it on the right-hand side, we should get no solution.

1078
01:36:07,000 --> 01:36:09,000
So let's give that a try.

1079
01:36:09,000 --> 01:36:16,000
We're going to create another vector, c, which has the x and y components are not equal.

1080
01:36:16,000 --> 01:36:17,000
All right.

1081
01:36:17,000 --> 01:36:19,000
And I plotted it.

1082
01:36:19,000 --> 01:36:23,000
So here's that vector.

1083
01:36:23,000 --> 01:36:26,000
I'm going to give you a view on that.

1084
01:36:26,000 --> 01:36:30,000
There you can see there.

1085
01:36:30,000 --> 01:36:31,000
There.

1086
01:36:31,000 --> 01:36:32,000
That's a good view right there.

1087
01:36:32,000 --> 01:36:38,000
You can see this new vector is the cyan-colored one.

1088
01:36:38,000 --> 01:36:44,000
And clearly it's not on the plane that the other three vectors lie on.

1089
01:36:44,000 --> 01:36:45,000
All right.

1090
01:36:45,000 --> 01:36:48,000
It's coming off the plane.

1091
01:36:48,000 --> 01:36:54,000
So that means that it is not in the span of the other three.

1092
01:36:54,000 --> 01:37:02,000
So it's not a linear combination of the other three, but really we're only interested in the other two.

1093
01:37:02,000 --> 01:37:06,000
It's not a linear combination of the columns of a.

1094
01:37:06,000 --> 01:37:19,000
So if we solve the system with c on the right-hand side, then here's what we end up with.

1095
01:37:19,000 --> 01:37:20,000
Okay.

1096
01:37:20,000 --> 01:37:21,000
So I didn't get it in reduced echelon form.

1097
01:37:21,000 --> 01:37:23,000
I wanted to leave it like this.

1098
01:37:23,000 --> 01:37:25,000
So this is just echelon form.

1099
01:37:25,000 --> 01:37:30,000
But notice the third row, you got zero, zero, and then negative two.

1100
01:37:30,000 --> 01:37:33,000
So zero, zero, something not zero.

1101
01:37:33,000 --> 01:37:36,000
So that tells us there's no solution.

1102
01:37:36,000 --> 01:37:37,000
Okay.

1103
01:37:37,000 --> 01:37:48,000
And then again, because that vector is not in the span, it's not in the space that's generated by the columns of a.

1104
01:37:48,000 --> 01:37:49,000
One more look.

1105
01:37:49,000 --> 01:37:53,000
I just created just a generic vector I called d.

1106
01:37:53,000 --> 01:38:02,000
And then let's look at the echelon form of the augmented matrix with a and d.

1107
01:38:02,000 --> 01:38:03,000
All right.

1108
01:38:03,000 --> 01:38:06,000
So it looks like this.

1109
01:38:06,000 --> 01:38:07,000
This is nice thing about maple.

1110
01:38:07,000 --> 01:38:20,000
It does this symbolic computation so you can do the computation with variables or parameters instead of all just constants.

1111
01:38:20,000 --> 01:38:26,000
And so we can see, notice the bottom row, we got zero, zero, and then something else over here.

1112
01:38:26,000 --> 01:38:28,000
And notice what that says.

1113
01:38:28,000 --> 01:38:36,000
It says that if this system has a solution, then d two minus d one has to equal zero.

1114
01:38:36,000 --> 01:38:37,000
Right.

1115
01:38:37,000 --> 01:38:45,000
Because if this is non zero over here, then we've got zero, zero, something not zero in the augmented column, which means no solution.

1116
01:38:45,000 --> 01:38:53,000
So for this system to have a solution, d two minus d one has to equal zero, which of course means that d two and d one are equal.

1117
01:38:53,000 --> 01:39:03,000
And since those back up here, those are the first two components, that's just saying that the X and Y components have to be equal for this system to have a solution.

1118
01:39:03,000 --> 01:39:15,000
Or graphically, the first two components have to be equal for the vector to lie on the plane that is spanned by a one and a two.

1119
01:39:15,000 --> 01:39:22,000
Okay, I'm going to stop there and we'll pick up the next slide in the next video.

1120
01:39:23,000 --> 01:39:26,000
Okay, I want to start back here with theorem four.

1121
01:39:26,000 --> 01:39:29,000
This is a very important theorem in your book.

1122
01:39:29,000 --> 01:39:33,000
So you want to play, pay close attention to this one.

1123
01:39:33,000 --> 01:39:36,000
So it says let A be an M by N matrix.

1124
01:39:36,000 --> 01:39:40,000
Then the following statements are logically equivalent.

1125
01:39:40,000 --> 01:39:47,000
That means for particular matrix A, either they are all true or they're all false.

1126
01:39:47,000 --> 01:39:51,000
And so that's a powerful theorem that we have here.

1127
01:39:51,000 --> 01:39:57,000
Okay, first statement is for each B and RM, the equation AX equals B is consistent.

1128
01:39:57,000 --> 01:40:06,000
So that's saying no matter what the right hand side is, for this particular matrix A, AX equals B is always consistent.

1129
01:40:06,000 --> 01:40:14,000
Another way to say that is that each B and RM is a linear combination of the columns of A.

1130
01:40:14,000 --> 01:40:19,000
Okay, because we saw just earlier that A times X, when you multiply A times X,

1131
01:40:19,000 --> 01:40:26,000
you're actually taking a linear combination of the columns of A.

1132
01:40:26,000 --> 01:40:30,000
This also means that the columns of A span RM, right?

1133
01:40:30,000 --> 01:40:40,000
Because you can produce any vector in RM as a linear combination of the columns of A.

1134
01:40:40,000 --> 01:40:47,000
And then down to the nitty-gritty, how you actually determine whether this is true or not,

1135
01:40:47,000 --> 01:40:50,000
is by putting A in echelon form.

1136
01:40:50,000 --> 01:40:55,000
And these are all true if A has a pivot position in every row.

1137
01:40:55,000 --> 01:41:00,000
So we saw that in the last, in the Maple demo.

1138
01:41:00,000 --> 01:41:07,000
Okay, if there's a pivot position in every row of A, that means of the coefficient matrix,

1139
01:41:07,000 --> 01:41:12,000
then there's no way the system could be inconsistent because you could never have a row of all zeros

1140
01:41:12,000 --> 01:41:22,000
and then in the augmented column, something non-zero.

1141
01:41:22,000 --> 01:41:27,000
Okay, we're going to look at one other way to compute A times X.

1142
01:41:27,000 --> 01:41:35,000
But first, we're looking at the inner product of two vectors because we're going to use that.

1143
01:41:35,000 --> 01:41:40,000
So if we're given two vectors in our n, say X and Y, then the inner product,

1144
01:41:40,000 --> 01:41:47,000
which is also called the dot product of X and Y, is computed as follows.

1145
01:41:47,000 --> 01:41:55,000
It's just X1 times Y1 plus X2 times Y2 plus so forth plus Xn times Yn.

1146
01:41:55,000 --> 01:41:59,000
Okay, so just multiplying light components and adding them up.

1147
01:41:59,000 --> 01:42:01,000
So here's an example.

1148
01:42:01,000 --> 01:42:08,000
We've got X is 1, 2, 3, Y is 4, 5, 6, then the inner product of X and Y, or X dot Y,

1149
01:42:08,000 --> 01:42:14,000
is 1 times 4 plus 2 times 5 plus 3 times 6.

1150
01:42:14,000 --> 01:42:20,000
Okay, so now let's talk about two ways we can compute A times X.

1151
01:42:20,000 --> 01:42:23,000
We already looked at one of these.

1152
01:42:23,000 --> 01:42:27,000
That's by taking a linear combination of the columns of A.

1153
01:42:27,000 --> 01:42:34,000
So here's an example to compute the product of this matrix A times X.

1154
01:42:34,000 --> 01:42:42,000
Then we take the first element of X and apply that to the first column of A.

1155
01:42:42,000 --> 01:42:47,000
Then second element negative 4 times the second column of A and so forth.

1156
01:42:47,000 --> 01:42:54,000
So we generate this linear combination and end up with this vector.

1157
01:42:54,000 --> 01:42:59,000
On the second way, we use inner products.

1158
01:42:59,000 --> 01:43:14,000
And the i-th element of the inner product of, the i-th element of AX is the inner product of the i-th row of A with X.

1159
01:43:14,000 --> 01:43:23,000
So looking at that, you look at, to get the first element here, the negative 3,

1160
01:43:23,000 --> 01:43:28,000
then it's the first row of A inner product with X.

1161
01:43:28,000 --> 01:43:35,000
So that's going to be 1 times 6 plus 2 times negative 4 plus 1 times negative 1,

1162
01:43:35,000 --> 01:43:40,000
which is what we have here in this first element here.

1163
01:43:40,000 --> 01:43:50,000
Then to get the second component of A times X, it's the second row of A inner product with X.

1164
01:43:50,000 --> 01:43:59,000
So negative 3 times 6 plus negative 1 times 4 plus 2 times negative 1 as we see here.

1165
01:43:59,000 --> 01:44:08,000
Then to get the third element, it's the third row of A inner product with the vector X.

1166
01:44:08,000 --> 01:44:14,000
So those are two different ways you can compute the product of a matrix and a vector.

1167
01:44:14,000 --> 01:44:19,000
For the most part, we will use this method, the linear combination of the columns of A,

1168
01:44:19,000 --> 01:44:23,000
just because that fits in with the way I want you to be thinking.

1169
01:44:23,000 --> 01:44:27,000
However, this method down here is probably quicker.

1170
01:44:27,000 --> 01:44:33,000
So if you just need to compute the product of a matrix and a vector,

1171
01:44:33,000 --> 01:44:40,000
you might want to just use this method using the inner product method just because it's faster.

1172
01:44:40,000 --> 01:44:45,000
So you should practice both just to make sure you know how to do each of these methods.

1173
01:44:45,000 --> 01:44:51,000
And I think that's it for this lesson.

1174
01:44:51,000 --> 01:44:56,000
Alright, so today we're going to talk about homogeneous linear systems.

1175
01:44:56,000 --> 01:45:04,000
And a homogeneous linear system is simply one in which the right hand side is the zero vector.

1176
01:45:04,000 --> 01:45:08,000
Zero vector is just a vector of all zeros.

1177
01:45:08,000 --> 01:45:12,000
So here's another way to look at it.

1178
01:45:12,000 --> 01:45:19,000
We look at A times X as a linear combination of the columns of A.

1179
01:45:19,000 --> 01:45:25,000
Is it here? X1A1 plus X2A2 plus dot dot dot XNAN.

1180
01:45:25,000 --> 01:45:28,000
And we want that to equal the zero vector.

1181
01:45:28,000 --> 01:45:31,000
Now, how can that happen?

1182
01:45:31,000 --> 01:45:39,000
Well, if you look at it a little bit, it's pretty clear that if you set each one of these X values equal to zero,

1183
01:45:39,000 --> 01:45:44,000
then you did a linear combination and you'll end up with the zero vector.

1184
01:45:44,000 --> 01:45:49,000
So therefore, a homogeneous system is always consistent.

1185
01:45:49,000 --> 01:45:54,000
X equals zero and all X values equal to zero is always a solution.

1186
01:45:54,000 --> 01:46:02,000
And since it's always a solution and it's obvious that it's a solution, we call it the trivial solution.

1187
01:46:02,000 --> 01:46:06,000
So we know that the system is consistent.

1188
01:46:06,000 --> 01:46:12,000
And if you think back to the two questions that we asked when we're solving the system,

1189
01:46:12,000 --> 01:46:14,000
the first one is, is it consistent?

1190
01:46:14,000 --> 01:46:16,000
So now we know this one is.

1191
01:46:16,000 --> 01:46:23,000
We wanted to question two, which is, okay, is the solution unique or are there an infinite number of solutions?

1192
01:46:23,000 --> 01:46:29,000
So in our case, if the solution is unique, that means you only have the trivial solution.

1193
01:46:29,000 --> 01:46:35,000
So what we want to know is, do there exist any non-trivial solutions?

1194
01:46:35,000 --> 01:46:42,000
Is the solution set an infinite set?

1195
01:46:42,000 --> 01:46:47,000
Well, the answer is just like it would be for any other system.

1196
01:46:47,000 --> 01:46:52,000
You'll have non-trivial solutions or you'll have an infinite number of solutions,

1197
01:46:52,000 --> 01:47:01,000
if and only if your system of equations has at least one free variable.

1198
01:47:01,000 --> 01:47:05,000
So we're going to look at a system here and solve it.

1199
01:47:05,000 --> 01:47:12,000
And we're going to write our solution in parametric vector form.

1200
01:47:12,000 --> 01:47:16,000
So that's something that's new in this section.

1201
01:47:16,000 --> 01:47:19,000
All right, so here's the system.

1202
01:47:19,000 --> 01:47:21,000
We want to solve x equals zero.

1203
01:47:21,000 --> 01:47:23,000
So we put it in an augmented matrix.

1204
01:47:23,000 --> 01:47:28,000
So we tack on the column of zeros and we do some row operations.

1205
01:47:28,000 --> 01:47:34,000
Notice that I have put my augmented matrix in reduced echelon form,

1206
01:47:34,000 --> 01:47:37,000
not just echelon form, but reduced echelon form.

1207
01:47:37,000 --> 01:47:44,000
And that is because that makes it easier to not only write the solution in general form,

1208
01:47:44,000 --> 01:47:48,000
but it makes it easier to write it in parametric vector form.

1209
01:47:48,000 --> 01:47:52,000
So anytime your system has an infinite number of solutions,

1210
01:47:52,000 --> 01:47:59,000
then it tends to be easier to write out the set of solutions

1211
01:47:59,000 --> 01:48:04,000
if you put your matrix in reduced echelon form first.

1212
01:48:04,000 --> 01:48:10,000
So looking at this matrix here, you can see that x1 and x2,

1213
01:48:10,000 --> 01:48:16,000
they're pivot columns in the x1 and x2 columns, pivot positions in the x1 and x2 columns.

1214
01:48:16,000 --> 01:48:19,000
So those are basic variables.

1215
01:48:19,000 --> 01:48:25,000
In the x3 column, we have no pivot position, so therefore x3 is a free variable.

1216
01:48:25,000 --> 01:48:29,000
Okay, so that means we've got an infinite number of solutions,

1217
01:48:29,000 --> 01:48:33,000
or this homogeneous system has non-trivial solutions.

1218
01:48:33,000 --> 01:48:35,000
So what do they look like?

1219
01:48:35,000 --> 01:48:40,000
Well, we can look at the second row and we get that x2,

1220
01:48:40,000 --> 01:48:43,000
it must be equal to 3 times x3,

1221
01:48:43,000 --> 01:48:48,000
and x1 is going to be equal to negative 4 times x3.

1222
01:48:48,000 --> 01:48:52,000
So we can write the general form of the solution as it's given here.

1223
01:48:52,000 --> 01:48:59,000
x3 is free, x1 and x2 are written in terms of the free variable.

1224
01:48:59,000 --> 01:49:02,000
Now to get the parametric vector form of the solution,

1225
01:49:02,000 --> 01:49:06,000
we start off with just a generic solution vector,

1226
01:49:06,000 --> 01:49:11,000
and basically just copy down the general form of the solution.

1227
01:49:11,000 --> 01:49:17,000
So this, what you see here, comes straight from looking at the general form of the solution.

1228
01:49:17,000 --> 01:49:20,000
And then to write it in parametric vector form,

1229
01:49:20,000 --> 01:49:23,000
we simply factor out the parameter.

1230
01:49:23,000 --> 01:49:28,000
In this case, x3 is the parameter because we can set x3 to be whatever we want

1231
01:49:28,000 --> 01:49:32,000
in order to generate as many solutions as we want.

1232
01:49:32,000 --> 01:49:35,000
So we have it now in parametric vector form.

1233
01:49:35,000 --> 01:49:39,000
Here's our parameter and here's our vector.

1234
01:49:39,000 --> 01:49:44,000
You should note that if you have more than one free variable,

1235
01:49:44,000 --> 01:49:51,000
then you're going to have more than one parameter and vector

1236
01:49:51,000 --> 01:49:54,000
when you write your solution in parametric vector form.

1237
01:49:54,000 --> 01:49:57,000
So you'd have, you know, if we had x4 that was a free variable,

1238
01:49:57,000 --> 01:50:02,000
we'd have x3 times this vector plus x4 times some other vector and so forth.

1239
01:50:02,000 --> 01:50:08,000
You'd have a vector for each free variable.

1240
01:50:09,000 --> 01:50:17,000
Okay, let's think about the relationship between the systems x equals 0 and ax equals b.

1241
01:50:17,000 --> 01:50:23,000
So what we've done to this point is solve ax equals 0 for a particular matrix a.

1242
01:50:23,000 --> 01:50:32,000
And now I want to keep that same a and solve the system ax equals b for this vector b given here.

1243
01:50:32,000 --> 01:50:36,000
And we'll write our solution in parametric vector form.

1244
01:50:36,000 --> 01:50:38,000
So we approach it the same way.

1245
01:50:38,000 --> 01:50:40,000
Here's our augmented matrix.

1246
01:50:40,000 --> 01:50:42,000
We do row operations.

1247
01:50:42,000 --> 01:50:46,000
Oops, sorry.

1248
01:50:46,000 --> 01:50:49,000
Backing up.

1249
01:50:49,000 --> 01:50:51,000
There we go.

1250
01:50:51,000 --> 01:50:56,000
We're doing row operations to get the matrix in reduced echelon form.

1251
01:50:56,000 --> 01:51:02,000
And if you want to go back and compare with what we did with ax equals 0,

1252
01:51:02,000 --> 01:51:05,000
these are the exact same row operations.

1253
01:51:05,000 --> 01:51:10,000
And that's because they were based on what was in the coefficient part of the matrix.

1254
01:51:10,000 --> 01:51:12,000
And so that hasn't changed.

1255
01:51:12,000 --> 01:51:14,000
So we do the same operation.

1256
01:51:14,000 --> 01:51:18,000
So the only thing that's changed is what's on the right-hand side.

1257
01:51:18,000 --> 01:51:28,000
Let me, oops, I'm backing up again.

1258
01:51:28,000 --> 01:51:31,000
Trying to get used to my mouse track pad here.

1259
01:51:31,000 --> 01:51:32,000
Sorry about that.

1260
01:51:32,000 --> 01:51:41,000
Let me point out that when you're solving ax equals 0 and you have all zeros on the right-hand side,

1261
01:51:41,000 --> 01:51:43,000
then those zeros never change.

1262
01:51:43,000 --> 01:51:49,000
Because when you do elementary row operations, any of those three elementary row operations,

1263
01:51:49,000 --> 01:51:51,000
they will never change.

1264
01:51:51,000 --> 01:51:55,000
If you start off with all zeros, you'll end up with all zeros.

1265
01:51:55,000 --> 01:51:58,000
Okay, so back to this example though.

1266
01:51:58,000 --> 01:52:04,000
When we write out our solution, those x3 is still free variable.

1267
01:52:04,000 --> 01:52:14,000
And now x2, when we write x2, then it's going to be 3, the 3 here, plus 3x3.

1268
01:52:14,000 --> 01:52:18,000
And x1 is going to be negative 5 minus 4x3.

1269
01:52:18,000 --> 01:52:20,000
So here's our solution.

1270
01:52:20,000 --> 01:52:25,000
And if we just write it in general form, here's what it looks like.

1271
01:52:25,000 --> 01:52:31,000
And parametric vector form, we start out just like we did previously,

1272
01:52:31,000 --> 01:52:38,000
write out what the general form looks like in a vector format.

1273
01:52:38,000 --> 01:52:46,000
And then we're going to separate out the part that involves a parameter and the constant part.

1274
01:52:46,000 --> 01:52:51,000
And then take it one step further and factor out the parameter.

1275
01:52:51,000 --> 01:53:00,000
And so notice that what we have here is exactly the solution that we had to ax equals 0.

1276
01:53:00,000 --> 01:53:06,000
And then with ax equals b, we have that plus this constant vector.

1277
01:53:06,000 --> 01:53:10,000
Now notice that the constant vector doesn't have a parameter associated with it.

1278
01:53:10,000 --> 01:53:12,000
It's just constant and it doesn't change.

1279
01:53:12,000 --> 01:53:20,000
But here we can multiply, we can set our parameter x3 to be anything and scale this vector.

1280
01:53:21,000 --> 01:53:28,000
Okay, so in general, the solution looks like this.

1281
01:53:28,000 --> 01:53:30,000
Here was solution to ax equals 0.

1282
01:53:30,000 --> 01:53:33,000
And notice that it's in this form.

1283
01:53:33,000 --> 01:53:37,000
It's in the form some parameter t times a vector v.

1284
01:53:37,000 --> 01:53:42,000
So in this case, x3 is plane t and this is the vector v.

1285
01:53:42,000 --> 01:53:47,000
So it's just a vector that we can scale any way we want.

1286
01:53:47,000 --> 01:53:52,000
Whereas for ax equals b, you still got the tv part, right?

1287
01:53:52,000 --> 01:53:54,000
You got x3 times this vector.

1288
01:53:54,000 --> 01:53:56,000
But you've got this constant vector.

1289
01:53:56,000 --> 01:53:58,000
So that's what I'm calling p.

1290
01:53:58,000 --> 01:54:05,000
And so for ax equals 0, you just have a vector that you can scale.

1291
01:54:05,000 --> 01:54:11,000
For ax equals b, you've still got the vector you can scale plus this other vector.

1292
01:54:11,000 --> 01:54:16,000
So let's look at graphically what is going on there.

1293
01:54:16,000 --> 01:54:22,000
Now for this, I'm going to just look at a case in R2.

1294
01:54:22,000 --> 01:54:30,000
So what you're going to see here is not the solutions to the system we were just looking at because that was in R3.

1295
01:54:30,000 --> 01:54:33,000
But it's a little bit easier when you draw pictures in R2.

1296
01:54:33,000 --> 01:54:35,000
So that's what I've got here.

1297
01:54:35,000 --> 01:54:42,000
So for ax equals 0, the solution set is all vectors of the form t times v.

1298
01:54:42,000 --> 01:54:44,000
So here's a vector v.

1299
01:54:44,000 --> 01:54:48,000
And we know that t times v is just any vector on this line.

1300
01:54:48,000 --> 01:54:55,000
So the line that you see here is the set of all solutions to ax equals 0.

1301
01:54:55,000 --> 01:55:01,000
Now let's look when we consider the vector p.

1302
01:55:01,000 --> 01:55:12,000
So for a solution set for ax equals b is of the form tv plus p.

1303
01:55:12,000 --> 01:55:19,000
And so remember all the vectors along here are the t times v.

1304
01:55:19,000 --> 01:55:29,000
And then so for any of these vectors, any point on this line, you can add p and you'll have a vector of the form tv plus p.

1305
01:55:29,000 --> 01:55:32,000
So here's one.

1306
01:55:32,000 --> 01:55:34,000
I just did v plus p.

1307
01:55:34,000 --> 01:55:41,000
So one times v plus p and doing the parallelogram method, you end up with this vector here.

1308
01:55:41,000 --> 01:55:45,000
We can do it for other vectors.

1309
01:55:45,000 --> 01:55:49,000
So here's p plus 2 times v.

1310
01:55:49,000 --> 01:55:53,000
Here's p plus 0 times v.

1311
01:55:53,000 --> 01:55:56,000
Here's p plus negative 1 times v.

1312
01:55:56,000 --> 01:56:02,000
So notice though that they all fall along this line.

1313
01:56:02,000 --> 01:56:05,000
So right here would be p plus 1 half v.

1314
01:56:05,000 --> 01:56:07,000
Here p plus 3 fourths v.

1315
01:56:07,000 --> 01:56:10,000
Here p plus 3 halves v and so forth.

1316
01:56:10,000 --> 01:56:23,000
So for every vector, every solution to ax equals 0 that you have on this line, there's a corresponding solution to ax equals b over here on this line.

1317
01:56:23,000 --> 01:56:33,000
And so we end up with this approach where along the blue line, that's all the solutions to ax equals 0.

1318
01:56:33,000 --> 01:56:38,000
Along the magenta line here, all solutions to ax equals b.

1319
01:56:38,000 --> 01:56:48,000
So notice that for ax equals 0, it's aligned through the origin because that's the trivial solution to ax equals 0.

1320
01:56:48,000 --> 01:57:01,000
And for ax equals b, you're moving away from the origin, so off this line, but parallel to the solution set for ax equals 0.

1321
01:57:01,000 --> 01:57:12,000
And if you look in three dimensions, let's suppose we have a problem where the solution set is a plane in three dimensions.

1322
01:57:12,000 --> 01:57:18,000
So for ax equals 0, it's a plane like this red one that's going to go through the origin.

1323
01:57:18,000 --> 01:57:24,000
And then for ax equals b, you get a parallel plane that's moved off the origin.

1324
01:57:24,000 --> 01:57:30,000
So for ax equals 0, you get this red plane that goes through the origin.

1325
01:57:30,000 --> 01:57:36,000
For ax equals b, you get a parallel plane that's off the origin.

1326
01:57:42,000 --> 01:57:47,000
All right, today we're going to talk about the concept of linear independence.

1327
01:57:47,000 --> 01:58:01,000
So if we have a set of vectors, let's say p vectors in Rn, the set is said to be linearly independent if we take a linear combination, set it equal to the 0 vector.

1328
01:58:01,000 --> 01:58:05,000
And this equation has only the trivial solution.

1329
01:58:05,000 --> 01:58:18,000
So the only way we can take a linear combination of the vectors and get the 0 vector is if all the coefficients are equal to 0.

1330
01:58:18,000 --> 01:58:31,000
Since this equation here is equivalent to the system defined by this augmented matrix, then we also say that the set is linearly independent.

1331
01:58:31,000 --> 01:58:44,000
If the system corresponding to the augmented matrix where we put all the vectors in as the columns, augment on the 0 vector, if that has only the trivial solution.

1332
01:58:44,000 --> 01:58:48,000
So these are equivalent.

1333
01:58:48,000 --> 01:58:57,000
Now, if this has only the trivial solution, then that means it has a unique solution, right, has only the trivial solution.

1334
01:58:57,000 --> 01:59:02,000
So all the c's equal to 0 is the only solution, so it's unique.

1335
01:59:02,000 --> 01:59:05,000
So that means it has no free variables.

1336
01:59:05,000 --> 01:59:21,000
So kind of the typical method of determining if a system or if a set of vectors is linearly independent is to stick them in the columns of a matrix as done here.

1337
01:59:21,000 --> 01:59:32,000
Take on the 0 vector for the augmented column and see if that matrix has any free variables in that system.

1338
01:59:32,000 --> 01:59:39,000
If there are no free variables, then you know the vectors are linearly independent.

1339
01:59:39,000 --> 01:59:48,000
If you do find a free variable, then you know that there are an infinite number of solutions to that system, and therefore the vectors are not linearly independent.

1340
01:59:48,000 --> 01:59:52,000
In that case, we say they're linearly dependent.

1341
01:59:52,000 --> 02:00:06,000
So here's a couple of vectors, and if we want to find out if they're linearly independent, then as I showed you before, take a linear combination of them and set it equal to 0 as I've done here.

1342
02:00:06,000 --> 02:00:09,000
We put that into an augmented matrix.

1343
02:00:09,000 --> 02:00:17,000
It looks like this with just the two vectors stuck in the columns and the 0 vector tacked on as the augmented column.

1344
02:00:17,000 --> 02:00:24,000
And we can do one row operation and zero out in this position.

1345
02:00:24,000 --> 02:00:31,000
And notice that we have no free variables, and therefore that means that we have only the trivial solution.

1346
02:00:31,000 --> 02:00:34,000
You can see the solution is unique.

1347
02:00:34,000 --> 02:00:40,000
And so these vectors are linearly independent.

1348
02:00:40,000 --> 02:00:43,000
Here's another set of vectors.

1349
02:00:44,000 --> 02:00:47,000
Just change just a little bit.

1350
02:00:47,000 --> 02:00:50,000
Let's see if they're linearly independent.

1351
02:00:50,000 --> 02:01:02,000
So again, we take a linear combination, set it equal to 0, stick that in as an augmented matrix, do one row operation, and we end up with this matrix here.

1352
02:01:02,000 --> 02:01:10,000
And notice that we've got a free variable, x2 here, the second column, has no pivot position, so x2 is a free variable.

1353
02:01:10,000 --> 02:01:16,000
So therefore these vectors are linearly dependent.

1354
02:01:16,000 --> 02:01:23,000
Now if you look at the vectors that we had, the first set, if we graph them, looks like this.

1355
02:01:23,000 --> 02:01:25,000
We had 2, 1, and 1, 4.

1356
02:01:25,000 --> 02:01:26,000
So they look like that.

1357
02:01:26,000 --> 02:01:28,000
They're linearly independent.

1358
02:01:28,000 --> 02:01:34,000
Whereas that second set, I believe we had 1, 4, and 2, 8.

1359
02:01:35,000 --> 02:01:37,000
1, 4, and 2, 8.

1360
02:01:37,000 --> 02:01:39,000
And so they're multiples of each other.

1361
02:01:39,000 --> 02:01:43,000
So they're indicated in this picture.

1362
02:01:43,000 --> 02:01:46,000
And they're linearly dependent.

1363
02:01:46,000 --> 02:02:02,000
Interestingly, you can see that these two vectors, if you think about the span of these two vectors, then you can take a linear combination of these two

1364
02:02:02,000 --> 02:02:05,000
and produce any vector in R2.

1365
02:02:05,000 --> 02:02:16,000
However, for these two, any linear combination of these two vectors only gets you vectors on the line that's defined by these vectors and going back in the negative direction here.

1366
02:02:16,000 --> 02:02:22,000
But you get no vectors off that line.

1367
02:02:22,000 --> 02:02:31,000
We've been looking at the two vector case, which at times can be misleading, but let's examine what we can say about it.

1368
02:02:31,000 --> 02:02:42,000
When you have just two vectors, then they are linearly dependent if at least one is a multiple of the other.

1369
02:02:42,000 --> 02:02:50,000
So if they're multiples of each other or one's a multiple of the other, then they are linearly dependent.

1370
02:02:50,000 --> 02:02:53,000
They're linearly independent if neither is a multiple of the other.

1371
02:02:53,000 --> 02:02:58,000
So that works when you only have two vectors.

1372
02:02:58,000 --> 02:03:06,000
Okay, so let's kind of expand our scope here and look at a set of three vectors.

1373
02:03:06,000 --> 02:03:15,000
So I took the set we were looking at initially, one, four, and two, one, and threw in another vector in there.

1374
02:03:15,000 --> 02:03:20,000
Now, what do you think? Are these vectors linearly independent?

1375
02:03:20,000 --> 02:03:25,000
Well, if we take a linear combination of them, set it equal to zero vector.

1376
02:03:25,000 --> 02:03:28,000
This is just going back to the first definition we talked about.

1377
02:03:28,000 --> 02:03:35,000
Then throw that in an augmented matrix, end up with this, and what happens?

1378
02:03:35,000 --> 02:03:39,000
No need to do any row operations. Why is that?

1379
02:03:39,000 --> 02:03:49,000
Let's think. How do we know if the system is, or if the system, we want to know does the system have only the trivial solution or not?

1380
02:03:49,000 --> 02:03:54,000
Or another way is, does it have any free variables?

1381
02:03:54,000 --> 02:03:58,000
Well, we can look at this one and say, yep, there's at least one free variable.

1382
02:03:58,000 --> 02:04:04,000
There has to be, because we have three variables and only two equations.

1383
02:04:04,000 --> 02:04:09,000
So three columns, only two rows. So we have to have at least one free variable.

1384
02:04:09,000 --> 02:04:14,000
So we can have at most two pivot positions.

1385
02:04:14,000 --> 02:04:20,000
So these vectors are linearly dependent.

1386
02:04:20,000 --> 02:04:26,000
Okay, so here's a rule. If the set contains more vectors, then there are entries in each vector.

1387
02:04:26,000 --> 02:04:28,000
Then the set's linearly dependent.

1388
02:04:28,000 --> 02:04:33,000
That's the case we just looked at. We had three vectors in R2.

1389
02:04:33,000 --> 02:04:38,000
So more entries, and more vectors, then there are entries in each vector.

1390
02:04:38,000 --> 02:04:47,000
Okay, there it is. Got three vectors and only two entries in each vector.

1391
02:04:47,000 --> 02:04:56,000
If we look at that augmented matrix and do some row operations on it,

1392
02:04:56,000 --> 02:04:58,000
we end up at this point.

1393
02:04:58,000 --> 02:05:02,000
Now remember, back here, just looking at this, you knew they were linearly dependent

1394
02:05:02,000 --> 02:05:06,000
because you had more vectors than there were entries in each vector.

1395
02:05:06,000 --> 02:05:11,000
But if we do these row operations and get this matrix in reduced echelon form,

1396
02:05:11,000 --> 02:05:13,000
then we end up here.

1397
02:05:13,000 --> 02:05:19,000
So if we wrote the solution of that system, it looks like this.

1398
02:05:19,000 --> 02:05:24,000
From the second row, you get x2 is going to equal 2x3.

1399
02:05:24,000 --> 02:05:30,000
x1 is equal to negative x3. x3 is a free variable.

1400
02:05:30,000 --> 02:05:36,000
So you can plug in anything you want for x3 to generate specific solutions.

1401
02:05:36,000 --> 02:05:40,000
For instance, if we said x3 equals 0, that's going to give us the trivial solution.

1402
02:05:40,000 --> 02:05:47,000
Because x3 is 0, and based on what x1 and x2 are,

1403
02:05:47,000 --> 02:05:51,000
defined in terms of x3, they're going to be 0 also.

1404
02:05:51,000 --> 02:05:59,000
If we said x3 equal to 1, then we get x1 is negative 1, x2 is 2, and x3 is 1.

1405
02:05:59,000 --> 02:06:03,000
Now, where does that apply to?

1406
02:06:03,000 --> 02:06:08,000
Well, notice we were trying to find a solution to this equation.

1407
02:06:08,000 --> 02:06:14,000
We were trying to see can we find nonzero values for x1, x2, and x3,

1408
02:06:14,000 --> 02:06:19,000
at least one of them nonzero, so that we can produce the zero vector.

1409
02:06:19,000 --> 02:06:29,000
So this general form of the solution tells us how to form the values for x1, x2, and x3.

1410
02:06:29,000 --> 02:06:36,000
So we can take our values that we got for x3 equals 1, plug them in.

1411
02:06:36,000 --> 02:06:40,000
So notice if we do that, we end up with negative 1 times 1,

1412
02:06:40,000 --> 02:06:49,000
and negative 1 plus 4 here is negative 3, I mean positive 3, minus 3 gives us 0.

1413
02:06:49,000 --> 02:06:57,000
And in the second position, we get negative 4 plus 2 is negative 2 plus 2 is 0.

1414
02:06:57,000 --> 02:07:04,000
So we can find specific values for these coefficients so that we can produce the zero vector.

1415
02:07:04,000 --> 02:07:12,000
Now notice from this, we can take that equation and solve it for negative 3, 2.

1416
02:07:12,000 --> 02:07:24,000
So we can just take this over to the other side and notice that negative 3, 2 can be written as a linear combination of 1, 4, and 2, 1.

1417
02:07:24,000 --> 02:07:26,000
That's what we've just done here.

1418
02:07:26,000 --> 02:07:32,000
We've written negative 3, 2 as a linear combination of the other two vectors.

1419
02:07:32,000 --> 02:07:41,000
Another way of saying that is that negative 3, 2 is in the span of these other two vectors.

1420
02:07:41,000 --> 02:07:47,000
It's a linear combination of them, so that means it's in the span of those two vectors.

1421
02:07:47,000 --> 02:07:51,000
And if you think back to our picture, that makes sense.

1422
02:07:51,000 --> 02:07:56,000
Here were the first two vectors, 2, 1, and 1, 4.

1423
02:07:56,000 --> 02:08:00,000
And remember before, I talked about how these span are two.

1424
02:08:00,000 --> 02:08:10,000
We can take a linear combination, we can scale each of them, and then add those scaled vectors together to produce any vector in R2.

1425
02:08:10,000 --> 02:08:13,000
And how do we know that?

1426
02:08:13,000 --> 02:08:21,000
Well, just look at those two vectors, do a row operation, and look, we have a pivot position in every row.

1427
02:08:21,000 --> 02:08:30,000
So by theorem 4, going back to section 1.4, theorem 4, that says that the vectors span R2.

1428
02:08:30,000 --> 02:08:47,000
One of the things in theorem 4 is if you have a pivot position in every row, that means the columns of the original matrix span the space in which they live, which in this case were in R2.

1429
02:08:47,000 --> 02:08:52,000
Okay, so here's another rule that relates to linear dependence.

1430
02:08:52,000 --> 02:09:01,000
A set of two or more vectors is linearly dependent, if and only if at least one of the vectors is a linear combination of the others.

1431
02:09:01,000 --> 02:09:09,000
So back here, we saw that negative 3, 2 is a linear combination of the other two vectors.

1432
02:09:09,000 --> 02:09:13,000
And in fact, we could have solved this system for any of these three vectors.

1433
02:09:13,000 --> 02:09:16,000
We could solve for any of these three vectors in terms of the other two.

1434
02:09:16,000 --> 02:09:23,000
So any of these vectors is a linear combination of the other two.

1435
02:09:23,000 --> 02:09:27,000
Okay, there you see it, again.

1436
02:09:27,000 --> 02:09:37,000
Alright, moving on, if there's another rule, keep in mind, if a set contains the zero vector, then that set is linearly dependent.

1437
02:09:37,000 --> 02:09:41,000
So if you have a zero vector in the set, then the set has to be linearly dependent.

1438
02:09:41,000 --> 02:09:43,000
Here's an example of that.

1439
02:09:43,000 --> 02:09:45,000
You get the zero vector.

1440
02:09:45,000 --> 02:09:48,000
Notice that it's always going to be a free variable.

1441
02:09:48,000 --> 02:09:57,000
Okay, the variable corresponding to the zero vector is always going to be free, and hence the set would be linearly dependent.

1442
02:09:57,000 --> 02:10:02,000
So summary, set of vectors is linearly independent.

1443
02:10:02,000 --> 02:10:08,000
If you take a linear combination, set it equal to zero, and you have only the trivial solution.

1444
02:10:08,000 --> 02:10:12,000
So all the x is equal to zero is the only solution.

1445
02:10:12,000 --> 02:10:27,000
Equivalently, you throw all those vectors into a matrix, tack on the zero vector for the augmented column, solve that system, and you get only the trivial solution.

1446
02:10:27,000 --> 02:10:35,000
Okay, on the other hand, it's linearly dependent if the system has at least one free variable.

1447
02:10:35,000 --> 02:10:39,000
Because in that case, you would have an infinite number of solutions.

1448
02:10:39,000 --> 02:10:51,000
And another way of characterizing linear dependence is a set's linearly dependent if at least one of the vectors is a linear combination of the others.

1449
02:10:51,000 --> 02:10:56,000
Okay, and that's it for section 1.7.

1450
02:10:56,000 --> 02:11:07,000
Okay, we're going to start today talking about linear transformations.

1451
02:11:07,000 --> 02:11:20,000
First, we're going to look back at something you're familiar with from algebra or calculus.

1452
02:11:20,000 --> 02:11:29,000
And we'll just look at a basic function which typically maps some real number to another real number.

1453
02:11:29,000 --> 02:11:33,000
So we map the set of real numbers to the set of real numbers.

1454
02:11:33,000 --> 02:11:38,000
So for example, here's a graph of a function f of x equals x squared.

1455
02:11:38,000 --> 02:11:49,000
And so you input a real number, okay, x is a real number, you square it, and you get another real number.

1456
02:11:49,000 --> 02:11:53,000
So it's mapping the real numbers to the real numbers.

1457
02:11:53,000 --> 02:11:56,000
Here's a little picture view of what's happening.

1458
02:11:56,000 --> 02:12:01,000
Here you're putting in a real number into your function.

1459
02:12:01,000 --> 02:12:06,000
And for our purposes here, we know what the function does, just squares the number.

1460
02:12:06,000 --> 02:12:10,000
But you really don't have to know exactly what the function does.

1461
02:12:10,000 --> 02:12:16,000
You know that what comes out though is another real number.

1462
02:12:16,000 --> 02:12:30,000
So this notation down here at the bottom is red f is a function that maps the real numbers to the real numbers.

1463
02:12:30,000 --> 02:12:35,000
Now let's move to talking about matrix transformations.

1464
02:12:35,000 --> 02:12:39,000
And it's the same basic idea as a function.

1465
02:12:39,000 --> 02:12:42,000
It's just defined in terms of a matrix.

1466
02:12:42,000 --> 02:12:46,000
So here t of x, t for transformation.

1467
02:12:46,000 --> 02:12:48,000
So we apply a transformation to x.

1468
02:12:48,000 --> 02:12:56,000
We multiply a times x where a is some m by n matrix that defines this transformation.

1469
02:12:56,000 --> 02:12:59,000
So here's a picture view of what's going on.

1470
02:12:59,000 --> 02:13:05,000
You have a vector from Rn that is the input to your transformation.

1471
02:13:05,000 --> 02:13:08,000
And the output is a vector in Rm.

1472
02:13:08,000 --> 02:13:13,000
The key here is that a is an m by n matrix.

1473
02:13:13,000 --> 02:13:18,000
And the transformation occurs by multiplying a times x.

1474
02:13:18,000 --> 02:13:23,000
So that means that x has to have as many entries as there are columns of a.

1475
02:13:23,000 --> 02:13:27,000
Because a times x is just a linear combination of the column.

1476
02:13:27,000 --> 02:13:31,000
So we need an x component to match up with each column of a.

1477
02:13:31,000 --> 02:13:35,000
And then each column of a has m entries.

1478
02:13:35,000 --> 02:13:39,000
So when we do that linear combination, we're going to end up with a vector with m entries.

1479
02:13:39,000 --> 02:13:45,000
And hence, we end up with a vector in Rm.

1480
02:13:45,000 --> 02:13:54,000
So we say that t maps Rn to Rm.

1481
02:13:54,000 --> 02:13:56,000
So for example, here's a matrix A.

1482
02:13:56,000 --> 02:14:01,000
And let's suppose that we have transformation t defined on this matrix.

1483
02:14:01,000 --> 02:14:05,000
So t of x equals A times x.

1484
02:14:05,000 --> 02:14:10,000
So here's a vector x equals 2, 1.

1485
02:14:10,000 --> 02:14:13,000
Then t of x is A times x.

1486
02:14:13,000 --> 02:14:18,000
So we do that multiplication, take a linear combination, and we end up with 1, 2.

1487
02:14:18,000 --> 02:14:23,000
Okay, so we started with a vector in R2 and ended up with a vector in R2.

1488
02:14:23,000 --> 02:14:28,000
Which makes sense, since A is 2 by 2.

1489
02:14:28,000 --> 02:14:31,000
Here's another example.

1490
02:14:31,000 --> 02:14:34,000
We're applying the transformation to the vector 4 negative 2.

1491
02:14:34,000 --> 02:14:37,000
So we multiply A times that vector.

1492
02:14:37,000 --> 02:14:45,000
And so we take a linear combination of the columns of A and end up with negative 2, 4.

1493
02:14:45,000 --> 02:14:54,000
If we look at it in a general case, so we just apply t to a generic vector x1, x2 from R2.

1494
02:14:54,000 --> 02:14:56,000
We did the same way as we did the previous two.

1495
02:14:56,000 --> 02:14:59,000
And notice we end up with x2, x1.

1496
02:14:59,000 --> 02:15:03,000
So this transformation has just reversed the order of the elements.

1497
02:15:03,000 --> 02:15:11,000
If you look back up at these other two, 2, 1, went to 1, 2, 4, negative 2, went to negative 2, 4.

1498
02:15:11,000 --> 02:15:13,000
So that's all this transformation is doing.

1499
02:15:13,000 --> 02:15:21,000
Swapping the order of the elements in the input vector.

1500
02:15:21,000 --> 02:15:27,000
If you look graphically at what's going on, here's one of the vectors, 2, 1.

1501
02:15:27,000 --> 02:15:33,000
And here was its transformation, which is 1, 2.

1502
02:15:33,000 --> 02:15:39,000
And here's the other one, 4 negative 2, which was transformed into negative 2, 4.

1503
02:15:39,000 --> 02:15:49,000
And so you can see from this picture that this transformation is reflecting a vector across the line y equals x.

1504
02:15:49,000 --> 02:15:52,000
Okay.

1505
02:15:52,000 --> 02:15:57,000
This is kind of a standard sort of thing that you see in computer graphics.

1506
02:15:57,000 --> 02:16:04,000
And so matrix transformations are really the fundamental element in computer graphics.

1507
02:16:04,000 --> 02:16:08,000
So if you were to go on and take that course in the computer science department,

1508
02:16:08,000 --> 02:16:13,000
you would be seeing a lot of matrix transformations.

1509
02:16:13,000 --> 02:16:14,000
Okay.

1510
02:16:14,000 --> 02:16:30,000
So to be a little more precise, we say a transformation t from rn to rm is a rule that assigns to each vector x and rn a vector t of x and rm.

1511
02:16:30,000 --> 02:16:32,000
There are more terminology.

1512
02:16:32,000 --> 02:16:39,000
Here, rn is called the domain of t, and rm is called the co-domain of t.

1513
02:16:39,000 --> 02:16:45,000
So rn is where the inputs to the transformation come from.

1514
02:16:45,000 --> 02:16:50,000
rm is where the outputs come from.

1515
02:16:50,000 --> 02:16:51,000
Okay.

1516
02:16:51,000 --> 02:16:57,000
For a given x in rn, t of x is called the image of x.

1517
02:16:57,000 --> 02:17:03,000
So the image of x is just the vector that x maps to.

1518
02:17:03,000 --> 02:17:13,000
If we look at all images, all possible images that we get under the transformation t, this is called the range of t.

1519
02:17:13,000 --> 02:17:14,000
Okay.

1520
02:17:14,000 --> 02:17:28,000
So the range of t is all images that we get when we map all possible vectors x through this transformation.

1521
02:17:28,000 --> 02:17:32,000
Now, you might be thinking that, well, isn't that the co-domain?

1522
02:17:32,000 --> 02:17:35,000
And the answer is sometimes it is, and sometimes it isn't.

1523
02:17:35,000 --> 02:17:36,000
Okay.

1524
02:17:36,000 --> 02:17:41,000
In general, the range is a subset of the co-domain.

1525
02:17:41,000 --> 02:17:44,000
In some cases, they are equal.

1526
02:17:44,000 --> 02:17:46,000
In others, they're not.

1527
02:17:46,000 --> 02:17:49,000
There are elements of the co-domain that are not in the range.

1528
02:17:49,000 --> 02:17:58,000
So not in general, not everything in the co-domain is mapped to necessarily.

1529
02:17:58,000 --> 02:17:59,000
Okay.

1530
02:17:59,000 --> 02:18:04,000
So here's back to our previous example.

1531
02:18:04,000 --> 02:18:09,000
We've got this transformation maps r2 to r2.

1532
02:18:09,000 --> 02:18:11,000
So the domain is r2.

1533
02:18:11,000 --> 02:18:20,000
And really the domain is the first set that you see here when you write down the transformation in this fashion.

1534
02:18:20,000 --> 02:18:22,000
The co-domain is also r2.

1535
02:18:22,000 --> 02:18:29,000
So we're mapping vectors from r2 to vectors in r2 also.

1536
02:18:29,000 --> 02:18:31,000
Now, the range, let's think about that.

1537
02:18:31,000 --> 02:18:38,000
Now, the range, think of the range as just everything that gets mapped to under this transformation.

1538
02:18:38,000 --> 02:18:47,000
And if you look at the picture that we had before, if you wanted to produce any vector,

1539
02:18:47,000 --> 02:18:53,000
then you can figure out what vector you need that would map to it because you just need to reverse the order of the elements.

1540
02:18:53,000 --> 02:18:58,000
So that means that the range of this transformation is all of r2.

1541
02:18:58,000 --> 02:19:07,000
So the co-domain and the range are equal in this case because any vector in r2 is mapped to.

1542
02:19:07,000 --> 02:19:08,000
All right.

1543
02:19:08,000 --> 02:19:10,000
Let's look at a different example.

1544
02:19:10,000 --> 02:19:11,000
Okay.

1545
02:19:11,000 --> 02:19:15,000
Here's one defined by different matrix A, still a 2 by 2 matrix.

1546
02:19:15,000 --> 02:19:20,000
So this transformation also maps r2 to r2.

1547
02:19:20,000 --> 02:19:21,000
Okay.

1548
02:19:21,000 --> 02:19:22,000
So the domain is r2.

1549
02:19:22,000 --> 02:19:24,000
The co-domain is r2.

1550
02:19:24,000 --> 02:19:29,000
Let's think about what is the range of this transformation?

1551
02:19:29,000 --> 02:19:33,000
Well, let's play around with it for just a little bit.

1552
02:19:33,000 --> 02:19:38,000
Let's take our old vector 2, 1, and see what it maps to.

1553
02:19:38,000 --> 02:19:45,000
If we apply the transformation to 2, 1, multiply A times 2, 1, and we end up with a vector 4, 8.

1554
02:19:45,000 --> 02:19:46,000
Okay.

1555
02:19:46,000 --> 02:19:47,000
How about another one?

1556
02:19:47,000 --> 02:19:49,000
Negative 3, 2.

1557
02:19:49,000 --> 02:19:51,000
A times that vector.

1558
02:19:51,000 --> 02:19:53,000
Take the linear combination.

1559
02:19:53,000 --> 02:19:55,000
You end up with a 1, 2.

1560
02:19:55,000 --> 02:19:58,000
So let's look at the general case.

1561
02:19:58,000 --> 02:19:59,000
What happens?

1562
02:19:59,000 --> 02:20:03,000
We apply it to just a generic vector x1, x2.

1563
02:20:03,000 --> 02:20:05,000
Do that matrix multiplication.

1564
02:20:05,000 --> 02:20:19,000
And we end up with this vector, which I can rewrite in this form to illustrate that the second component of the vector is just twice the first one.

1565
02:20:19,000 --> 02:20:22,000
And you see that in these other two that we did, right here.

1566
02:20:22,000 --> 02:20:24,000
The second component is 2 times the first.

1567
02:20:24,000 --> 02:20:28,000
Here, again, second component is 2 times the first.

1568
02:20:28,000 --> 02:20:41,000
So if we look at that graphically, every vector that we can map to is of this form, the second component is 2 times the first.

1569
02:20:41,000 --> 02:20:46,000
So that's actually all vectors on the line y equals 2x.

1570
02:20:46,000 --> 02:20:49,000
The second component is 2 times the first.

1571
02:20:49,000 --> 02:20:53,000
Here's 2, 1, and it maps to 4, 8.

1572
02:20:53,000 --> 02:20:55,000
So it's on this line.

1573
02:20:55,000 --> 02:21:04,000
The vector negative 3, 2, I believe it was that we looked at, it mapped to 1, 2.

1574
02:21:04,000 --> 02:21:06,000
So here it falls on the line.

1575
02:21:06,000 --> 02:21:13,000
So no matter what vector you choose, it's going to be projected onto this line.

1576
02:21:13,000 --> 02:21:18,000
So the range of this transformation is simply this line.

1577
02:21:18,000 --> 02:21:23,000
The line y equals 2x, or all vectors of the form x1, 2x1.

1578
02:21:23,000 --> 02:21:27,000
So all vectors where the second component is just 2 times the first.

1579
02:21:27,000 --> 02:21:32,000
So here, the range is not the same as the co-domain.

1580
02:21:32,000 --> 02:21:38,000
The co-domain is r2, but the range is just this line y equals 2x.

1581
02:21:38,000 --> 02:21:43,000
So it's just part of the co-domain.

1582
02:21:43,000 --> 02:21:53,000
Okay, suppose at this point, we know given a transformation in the matrix that defines it,

1583
02:21:53,000 --> 02:21:58,000
we can compute t of x, and just multiply 8 times x.

1584
02:21:58,000 --> 02:22:03,000
A little more difficult question is this one.

1585
02:22:03,000 --> 02:22:10,000
How do we determine if a given vector b is in the range of a particular transformation?

1586
02:22:10,000 --> 02:22:16,000
So we're asking, is there a vector x that maps to b?

1587
02:22:16,000 --> 02:22:21,000
Or is there a vector x such that t of x is equal to b?

1588
02:22:21,000 --> 02:22:30,000
And since t of x equals 8 times x, we can say, does there exist a vector x such that 8 times x equals b?

1589
02:22:30,000 --> 02:22:35,000
And now we're back into the realm of looking at systems of equations.

1590
02:22:35,000 --> 02:22:38,000
And we're very familiar with that.

1591
02:22:38,000 --> 02:22:42,000
So simply a system of equations to solve.

1592
02:22:42,000 --> 02:22:47,000
So let's go back to that previous example.

1593
02:22:47,000 --> 02:22:53,000
And suppose you're asked, is this vector 612 in the range of t?

1594
02:22:53,000 --> 02:22:59,000
And we know that since the range of t is all vectors on the line y equals 2x,

1595
02:22:59,000 --> 02:23:04,000
then it should be because the second component 12 is 2 times the first.

1596
02:23:04,000 --> 02:23:07,000
So let's solve the system of equations.

1597
02:23:07,000 --> 02:23:13,000
Here's the augmented matrix corresponding to ax equals b, where b is 612.

1598
02:23:13,000 --> 02:23:16,000
And we do one row operation, and here we go.

1599
02:23:16,000 --> 02:23:20,000
It's an echelon form, and clearly the system is consistent.

1600
02:23:20,000 --> 02:23:28,000
So therefore, the vector is in the range of t.

1601
02:23:28,000 --> 02:23:31,000
About another one, about 610.

1602
02:23:31,000 --> 02:23:35,000
Now in this case, notice the second component is not 2 times the first.

1603
02:23:35,000 --> 02:23:40,000
So you would expect this vector not to be in the range of t,

1604
02:23:40,000 --> 02:23:45,000
which would mean that the system should be inconsistent.

1605
02:23:45,000 --> 02:23:50,000
And as you see, do one row operation, and you end up with 00 and then negative 2.

1606
02:23:50,000 --> 02:23:54,000
So that's clearly the system is inconsistent.

1607
02:23:54,000 --> 02:23:57,000
So this vector is not in the range of t.

1608
02:23:57,000 --> 02:24:02,000
So to determine if a vector is in the range of a linear transformation,

1609
02:24:02,000 --> 02:24:07,000
you need to solve a system of equations.

1610
02:24:07,000 --> 02:24:11,000
Okay, changing gears just a little bit.

1611
02:24:11,000 --> 02:24:20,000
Previously, we learned that matrix multiplication has certain properties,

1612
02:24:20,000 --> 02:24:23,000
and one of them is this one.

1613
02:24:23,000 --> 02:24:29,000
If you multiply matrix times the sum of two vectors, then you can distribute.

1614
02:24:29,000 --> 02:24:34,000
So a times u plus v is equal to au plus av.

1615
02:24:34,000 --> 02:24:41,000
And similarly, if you multiply a times a scalar times a vector,

1616
02:24:41,000 --> 02:24:44,000
then you can move the scalar out.

1617
02:24:44,000 --> 02:24:49,000
So a times cu is the same as c times au.

1618
02:24:49,000 --> 02:24:55,000
Now I bring that up because that applies here.

1619
02:24:55,000 --> 02:25:03,000
Okay, so a transformation is said to be linear if the following conditions hold.

1620
02:25:03,000 --> 02:25:08,000
That t of u plus v is t of u plus t of v.

1621
02:25:08,000 --> 02:25:12,000
And t of c times u is c times t of u.

1622
02:25:12,000 --> 02:25:17,000
Okay, so these two conditions look very similar to what we have up there.

1623
02:25:17,000 --> 02:25:24,000
And in fact, since we define our transformation as a times x,

1624
02:25:24,000 --> 02:25:28,000
then these are really equivalent.

1625
02:25:28,000 --> 02:25:37,000
Okay, so linear transformations preserve the operations of vector addition and scalar multiplication.

1626
02:25:37,000 --> 02:25:40,000
And we'll stop here at this point.

1627
02:25:40,000 --> 02:25:44,000
And then the next video will be for section 1.9,

1628
02:25:44,000 --> 02:25:53,000
which will include more information on linear transformations.

1629
02:25:53,000 --> 02:25:59,000
All right, we're going to start with more on linear transformations.

1630
02:25:59,000 --> 02:26:02,000
Let's suppose we have a transformation t.

1631
02:26:02,000 --> 02:26:11,000
And suppose that all you know about t is that the vector 1, 0 gets mapped to 2, 0, 1.

1632
02:26:11,000 --> 02:26:16,000
And you know that 0, 1 gets mapped to this vector.

1633
02:26:16,000 --> 02:26:23,000
So just from looking at this, you can tell that t maps r2 to r3.

1634
02:26:23,000 --> 02:26:31,000
So we're taking vectors in r2 and we're mapping them to r3.

1635
02:26:31,000 --> 02:26:42,000
But how can we find a general rule for how to determine t of just a generic vector x?

1636
02:26:42,000 --> 02:26:49,000
So t of x1, x2 for any vector x1, x2.

1637
02:26:49,000 --> 02:26:53,000
Well, to get this just based on the information that we have,

1638
02:26:53,000 --> 02:26:57,000
we need to use the properties of linear transformation.

1639
02:26:57,000 --> 02:27:06,000
So remember, we talked about these last time that t of u plus v is t of u plus t of v.

1640
02:27:06,000 --> 02:27:14,000
And t of scalar times the vector is that scalar times t of the vector.

1641
02:27:14,000 --> 02:27:18,000
So let's examine what we have.

1642
02:27:18,000 --> 02:27:26,000
Notice that we can write a generic vector x1, x2 as x1 times 1, 0 plus x2 times 0, 1.

1643
02:27:26,000 --> 02:27:34,000
Now remember on backwards, we know what we get when we apply t to 1, 0.

1644
02:27:34,000 --> 02:27:37,000
And we know what we get when we apply t to 0, 1.

1645
02:27:37,000 --> 02:27:39,000
So keep that in mind.

1646
02:27:39,000 --> 02:27:45,000
So we're going to write x1, x2 as x1 times 1, 0, x2 times 0, 1.

1647
02:27:45,000 --> 02:27:49,000
So then I'm going to apply t to both sides of this equation.

1648
02:27:49,000 --> 02:27:57,000
So I'll have t of x1, x2 is equal to t of this stuff here.

1649
02:27:57,000 --> 02:28:08,000
Now since t's a linear transformation, t of, this is like t of a plus, or u plus v,

1650
02:28:08,000 --> 02:28:13,000
if you want to think of it like that, so we can break it up into t of u plus t of v.

1651
02:28:13,000 --> 02:28:17,000
And then this is like a constant times a vector.

1652
02:28:17,000 --> 02:28:25,000
So t of a constant times a vector, we can rewrite as that constant times t of that vector.

1653
02:28:25,000 --> 02:28:27,000
Okay, so we end up with this.

1654
02:28:27,000 --> 02:28:30,000
And we know what t of 1, 0 is.

1655
02:28:30,000 --> 02:28:33,000
It's just this vector, and we know what t of 0, 1 is.

1656
02:28:33,000 --> 02:28:35,000
It's this vector.

1657
02:28:35,000 --> 02:28:37,000
So here's what we end up with.

1658
02:28:37,000 --> 02:28:44,000
And so notice this is just a linear combination of these two vectors, which we can rewrite in this form

1659
02:28:44,000 --> 02:28:50,000
as a matrix with those columns times the components x1, x2.

1660
02:28:50,000 --> 02:28:57,000
So notice that we've written t of x, okay, generic vector x, as a times x.

1661
02:28:57,000 --> 02:29:04,000
So now we have the matrix with which to apply the transformation.

1662
02:29:04,000 --> 02:29:19,000
And as you can see, that matrix is simply the vectors that you get when you apply t to the vector 1, 0, and 0, 1.

1663
02:29:19,000 --> 02:29:28,000
Now those columns that we just looked at, 1, 0, and 0, 1, those are special vectors.

1664
02:29:28,000 --> 02:29:33,000
And to talk about that, let's first define the identity matrix.

1665
02:29:33,000 --> 02:29:36,000
So the identity matrix is an n by n matrix.

1666
02:29:36,000 --> 02:29:41,000
So let's square and we write it as i sub n.

1667
02:29:41,000 --> 02:29:44,000
And it has 1's on the main diagonal.

1668
02:29:44,000 --> 02:29:50,000
The main diagonal is the 1, 1 position, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4.

1669
02:29:50,000 --> 02:29:54,000
So it has 1's down the diagonal and 0's everywhere else.

1670
02:29:54,000 --> 02:29:55,000
So here are a few examples.

1671
02:29:55,000 --> 02:29:58,000
i2's, 2 by 2, got 1's on the diagonal.

1672
02:29:58,000 --> 02:30:03,000
i3's a 3 by 3, 1's on the diagonal, 0's everywhere else.

1673
02:30:03,000 --> 02:30:05,000
And here's i4.

1674
02:30:05,000 --> 02:30:09,000
So i sub n is just an n by n identity matrix.

1675
02:30:09,000 --> 02:30:11,000
Now notice i sub 2.

1676
02:30:11,000 --> 02:30:16,000
You see those columns that we were just dealing with, those vectors 1, 0, and 0, 1.

1677
02:30:16,000 --> 02:30:20,000
So they are the columns of the identity matrix.

1678
02:30:20,000 --> 02:30:24,000
And they are so special that we give them their own names.

1679
02:30:24,000 --> 02:30:29,000
We call them e1, e2, so forth, the e sub n, depending on what n is.

1680
02:30:29,000 --> 02:30:35,000
So this column here would be e sub 1, this one e sub 2, and a 2 by 2 matrix.

1681
02:30:35,000 --> 02:30:41,000
Here for 3 by 3, this would be e sub 1, this e sub 2, this e sub 3.

1682
02:30:41,000 --> 02:30:48,000
So what they actually are depends on the size of the matrix that we're talking about.

1683
02:30:48,000 --> 02:30:52,000
There it is with 2 by 2.

1684
02:30:52,000 --> 02:30:59,000
Now, as we saw in the previous example, if you know t of e1, t of e2, and so forth,

1685
02:30:59,000 --> 02:31:05,000
if you know what you get when you apply the transformation to these columns of the identity matrix,

1686
02:31:05,000 --> 02:31:09,000
then you can compute t of x for any vector x.

1687
02:31:09,000 --> 02:31:13,000
That's what we showed in that earlier example.

1688
02:31:13,000 --> 02:31:17,000
So here it is written in a little more formal manner.

1689
02:31:17,000 --> 02:31:26,000
If we have t that maps rn to rm, then there is a unique matrix A such that t of x equals ax.

1690
02:31:26,000 --> 02:31:34,000
In fact, A is the m by n matrix whose jth column is the vector t of ej,

1691
02:31:34,000 --> 02:31:37,000
where ej is the jth column of the identity matrix.

1692
02:31:37,000 --> 02:31:43,000
And so if you think back to the example we just did, this is exactly what we came out with.

1693
02:31:43,000 --> 02:31:50,000
What our matrix A was t of e1 and t of e2, because we had a 2 by 2 example.

1694
02:31:50,000 --> 02:31:57,000
This matrix A is called the standard matrix for the linear transformation t.

1695
02:31:57,000 --> 02:32:01,000
So it's a special matrix.

1696
02:32:01,000 --> 02:32:09,000
Now, we're interested in determining conditions under which a transformation has an inverse.

1697
02:32:09,000 --> 02:32:14,000
So that means if you have a transformation that maps rn to rm,

1698
02:32:14,000 --> 02:32:24,000
then given some b in rm, can we find an x in rn that maps to that b?

1699
02:32:24,000 --> 02:32:28,000
Or can we find x such that t of x equals b?

1700
02:32:28,000 --> 02:32:36,000
Let's go back to our functions just defining the real numbers first of all.

1701
02:32:36,000 --> 02:32:43,000
So before we looked at the function f of x equals x squared.

1702
02:32:43,000 --> 02:32:46,000
And this is what it looks like.

1703
02:32:46,000 --> 02:32:49,000
Now, a couple things to notice.

1704
02:32:49,000 --> 02:32:55,000
One is that you never get a negative number.

1705
02:32:55,000 --> 02:33:01,000
When you plug in any x, no matter what x you plug in, since we're starting with real numbers,

1706
02:33:01,000 --> 02:33:07,000
no matter what real number x you plug in, you always get a non-negative value.

1707
02:33:07,000 --> 02:33:09,000
Just keep that in mind.

1708
02:33:09,000 --> 02:33:15,000
And also note that we can get the same y value.

1709
02:33:15,000 --> 02:33:22,000
So if I drew a horizontal line, I would hit a couple of places on this graph.

1710
02:33:22,000 --> 02:33:31,000
So for a given y value, we've got a couple different x values that can produce that y value.

1711
02:33:31,000 --> 02:33:35,000
So keep that in mind.

1712
02:33:35,000 --> 02:33:42,000
f of x equals x squared that we just looked at is not invertible for two reasons.

1713
02:33:42,000 --> 02:33:46,000
One, there exists y in r.

1714
02:33:46,000 --> 02:33:52,000
So there's some real numbers for which there's no x such that f of x equals y.

1715
02:33:52,000 --> 02:33:56,000
There's no x such that x squared equals y.

1716
02:33:56,000 --> 02:33:58,000
So consider y equals negative one.

1717
02:33:58,000 --> 02:34:04,000
We cannot come up with a real number x such that x squared equals negative one.

1718
02:34:04,000 --> 02:34:09,000
That means that there are values in the co-domain that are not in the range.

1719
02:34:09,000 --> 02:34:12,000
The co-domain here is the real numbers.

1720
02:34:12,000 --> 02:34:21,000
But the range for this function is all non-negative real numbers.

1721
02:34:21,000 --> 02:34:29,000
So we can never get a negative number when we apply this function.

1722
02:34:29,000 --> 02:34:34,000
So we say that this function is not on to the real numbers.

1723
02:34:34,000 --> 02:34:38,000
There are real numbers that don't get mapped to.

1724
02:34:38,000 --> 02:34:41,000
I'm going to define that term in just a minute.

1725
02:34:41,000 --> 02:34:50,000
But I want to give you an example, something that's pretty easy for you to grasp.

1726
02:34:50,000 --> 02:34:53,000
So I said f is not invertible for two reasons.

1727
02:34:53,000 --> 02:34:55,000
Here's the second one.

1728
02:34:55,000 --> 02:34:58,000
That there exists y in r.

1729
02:34:58,000 --> 02:35:05,000
So there exists real numbers y for which a squared is y and b squared is y.

1730
02:35:05,000 --> 02:35:07,000
But a and b are not equal.

1731
02:35:07,000 --> 02:35:12,000
And that's that horizontal line thing I was talking about earlier.

1732
02:35:12,000 --> 02:35:18,000
So for example, if y is four, we can get that with two because two squared is four.

1733
02:35:18,000 --> 02:35:23,000
We can also get there with negative two because negative two squared is four.

1734
02:35:23,000 --> 02:35:30,000
So if we were trying to get an inverse, we started with four and we wouldn't know how did we get there.

1735
02:35:30,000 --> 02:35:35,000
Well, we don't know because it could have been from two or it could have been from negative two.

1736
02:35:35,000 --> 02:35:42,000
So we say that this function is not one to one because of this reason.

1737
02:35:42,000 --> 02:35:46,000
Okay, so here's a little more formal way to look at it.

1738
02:35:46,000 --> 02:35:55,000
We say a transformation from rn to rm is onto rm, onto the co-domain.

1739
02:35:55,000 --> 02:36:08,000
If each b in rm is the image of, or another way to think of it is, is mapped to by at least one x in rn.

1740
02:36:08,000 --> 02:36:15,000
So every b in the co-domain is mapped to by at least one x in the domain.

1741
02:36:15,000 --> 02:36:20,000
So every b gets mapped to.

1742
02:36:20,000 --> 02:36:28,000
Okay, so this means that no matter what vector b you choose from rm, there's some x that maps to it.

1743
02:36:28,000 --> 02:36:35,000
So for every b in rm, there's some x such that t of x equals b.

1744
02:36:35,000 --> 02:36:44,000
And since t of x equals a times x, this means that for every b, there's some x such that a times x equals b.

1745
02:36:44,000 --> 02:36:54,000
If there's an x such that t of x is b, then it has to be the same x that makes a times x equals b.

1746
02:36:54,000 --> 02:37:01,000
Now, when is it true that no matter what right hand side you have, you'll always have a solution?

1747
02:37:01,000 --> 02:37:07,000
Well, that's true when you have a pivot position in every row of a.

1748
02:37:07,000 --> 02:37:18,000
So if there's a pivot position in every row of a, then the transformation will be on two.

1749
02:37:18,000 --> 02:37:20,000
Okay, let's talk about one-to-one.

1750
02:37:20,000 --> 02:37:33,000
Transformation from rn to rm is said to be one-to-one if each b in rm is the image of, or is mapped to by at most one x in rn.

1751
02:37:34,000 --> 02:37:38,000
So remember back to the function f of x equals x squared.

1752
02:37:38,000 --> 02:37:44,000
This wasn't true because you could get to four from two and from negative two.

1753
02:37:44,000 --> 02:37:53,000
So there was an element in the range that was mapped to by more than one element in the domain.

1754
02:37:53,000 --> 02:37:55,000
So it wasn't one-to-one.

1755
02:37:55,000 --> 02:38:05,000
Here one-to-one means each b in rm is mapped to by at most one x in rn.

1756
02:38:05,000 --> 02:38:15,000
So that means that for each b in rm, there's at most one vector x such that t of x equals b.

1757
02:38:15,000 --> 02:38:25,000
So that means that since t of x equals ax, if we look at the system ax equals b, it can't have an infinite number of solutions.

1758
02:38:25,000 --> 02:38:29,000
Because then there would be more than one x that maps to that b.

1759
02:38:29,000 --> 02:38:36,000
And if our system can't have an infinite number of solutions, that means it can't have free variables.

1760
02:38:36,000 --> 02:38:41,000
So x equals b can have no free variables.

1761
02:38:41,000 --> 02:38:44,000
And it has no free variables.

1762
02:38:44,000 --> 02:38:50,000
That means there must be a pivot position in each column of a.

1763
02:38:50,000 --> 02:39:00,000
So the transformation is one-to-one if there's a pivot position in each column of a.

1764
02:39:00,000 --> 02:39:05,000
So one-to-one, there's a pivot position in each column.

1765
02:39:05,000 --> 02:39:09,000
Onto, there must be a pivot position in each row.

1766
02:39:09,000 --> 02:39:22,000
So that's how you can keep straight one-to-one and onto.

1767
02:39:22,000 --> 02:39:28,000
This is section 2.1 on matrix operations.

1768
02:39:28,000 --> 02:39:32,000
Just some basics out of the way first.

1769
02:39:32,000 --> 02:39:41,000
We refer to an m by n matrix A as a matrix with m rows and n columns.

1770
02:39:41,000 --> 02:39:57,000
And the individual elements in the matrix we denote by lowercase a with a subscript ij where i is the row index and j is the column index.

1771
02:39:57,000 --> 02:40:04,000
The diagonal entries in a matrix A are those where the row and column indices are the same.

1772
02:40:04,000 --> 02:40:07,000
So like a11, a22, and so forth.

1773
02:40:07,000 --> 02:40:14,000
These elements we call the main diagonal of A.

1774
02:40:14,000 --> 02:40:24,000
A diagonal matrix is a square matrix where all the entries off the main diagonal are zero.

1775
02:40:24,000 --> 02:40:31,000
So the only place you can have non-zero values is on the diagonal.

1776
02:40:31,000 --> 02:40:34,000
So here are a couple of diagonal matrices.

1777
02:40:34,000 --> 02:40:41,000
Notice that the key is off the diagonal, you have all zeros.

1778
02:40:41,000 --> 02:40:46,000
So the main diagonal is just a 11, 22, and so forth.

1779
02:40:46,000 --> 02:40:49,000
33 in this case.

1780
02:40:49,000 --> 02:40:53,000
So off the diagonal, off the main diagonal you have all zeros.

1781
02:40:53,000 --> 02:41:02,000
It's okay to have a zero on the diagonal, we really don't care what's on the diagonal, we just want zeros off the diagonal.

1782
02:41:02,000 --> 02:41:06,000
Here's another diagonal matrix.

1783
02:41:06,000 --> 02:41:10,000
This one has a name, we call it the identity matrix.

1784
02:41:10,000 --> 02:41:17,000
So it's a diagonal matrix because everything off the diagonal is zeros.

1785
02:41:17,000 --> 02:41:28,000
And the zero matrix is technically a diagonal matrix because everything off the main diagonal is zero.

1786
02:41:28,000 --> 02:41:35,000
We say that two matrices are equal if they have the same size, so the same number of rows, same number of columns,

1787
02:41:35,000 --> 02:41:38,000
and their corresponding entries are equal.

1788
02:41:38,000 --> 02:41:43,000
So the one one entry in one is equal to the one one entry in another.

1789
02:41:43,000 --> 02:41:50,000
In general, the i jth entry in one is equal to the i jth entry in the other.

1790
02:41:50,000 --> 02:41:52,000
We can compute the sum of two matrices.

1791
02:41:52,000 --> 02:41:55,000
We add two matrices together.

1792
02:41:55,000 --> 02:41:59,000
This is defined if both matrices are the same size.

1793
02:41:59,000 --> 02:42:03,000
So they have the same number of rows and same number of columns.

1794
02:42:03,000 --> 02:42:18,000
And in this case, the i jth entry in the sum is just the sum of the i jth entries in each of the original matrices.

1795
02:42:18,000 --> 02:42:27,000
So here's an example one that this sum cannot be computed because these matrices are not the same size.

1796
02:42:27,000 --> 02:42:30,000
Here's one where we can't compute the sum.

1797
02:42:30,000 --> 02:42:37,000
And notice the seven here is just the three plus four to get the three.

1798
02:42:37,000 --> 02:42:40,000
It's this two plus one and so forth.

1799
02:42:40,000 --> 02:42:51,000
So to get the i jth entry over here, you sum the corresponding i jth entries in the two original matrices.

1800
02:42:51,000 --> 02:42:54,000
We can compute the scalar multiple of a matrix.

1801
02:42:54,000 --> 02:42:58,000
In the same way, we compute the scalar multiple of a vector.

1802
02:42:58,000 --> 02:43:02,000
We just multiply each entry by that scalar.

1803
02:43:02,000 --> 02:43:04,000
So here's an example.

1804
02:43:04,000 --> 02:43:15,000
Multiply three times each entry in this matrix and we produce this one.

1805
02:43:15,000 --> 02:43:22,000
Your book lists and properties of addition and scalar multiplication of matrices.

1806
02:43:22,000 --> 02:43:26,000
The first three are regarding addition.

1807
02:43:26,000 --> 02:43:35,000
So you'll find that since addition of matrices is defined essentially the same as addition of real numbers,

1808
02:43:35,000 --> 02:43:38,000
then a lot of those same properties carry over.

1809
02:43:38,000 --> 02:43:40,000
So a plus b is b plus a.

1810
02:43:40,000 --> 02:43:48,000
The second one allows you to associate the parentheses as you'd like.

1811
02:43:48,000 --> 02:43:50,000
So that's the associative property.

1812
02:43:50,000 --> 02:43:57,000
And if you add any matrix to the zero matrix, you get the same matrix back.

1813
02:43:57,000 --> 02:44:02,000
Then the last three are regarding scalar multiplication.

1814
02:44:02,000 --> 02:44:10,000
And essentially they say that you can kind of stick the scalar wherever you'd like to, wherever it's convenient.

1815
02:44:10,000 --> 02:44:16,000
All is equivalent.

1816
02:44:16,000 --> 02:44:21,000
Okay, let's move on to matrix multiplication.

1817
02:44:21,000 --> 02:44:29,000
Because matrix multiplication is not defined simply as matrix addition is.

1818
02:44:29,000 --> 02:44:31,000
It's more complicated.

1819
02:44:31,000 --> 02:44:35,000
It's not just multiplying the corresponding entries together.

1820
02:44:35,000 --> 02:44:37,000
So here we go.

1821
02:44:37,000 --> 02:44:42,000
If a is an m by n matrix and the sizes are important here.

1822
02:44:42,000 --> 02:44:48,000
So suppose a is m by n and b is n by p.

1823
02:44:48,000 --> 02:44:50,000
Okay, so that's the key.

1824
02:44:50,000 --> 02:45:00,000
The number of columns in the first has to equal the number of rows in the second for the product to be defined.

1825
02:45:00,000 --> 02:45:10,000
Okay, so if you have that situation and we say that the columns of b are b1 through bp,

1826
02:45:10,000 --> 02:45:17,000
then we define the product ab as the m by p matrix.

1827
02:45:17,000 --> 02:45:23,000
And notice that the m is number rows in a, p's number columns in b.

1828
02:45:23,000 --> 02:45:27,000
So we kind of always look to see if these inner dimensions match up.

1829
02:45:27,000 --> 02:45:31,000
So the n here matches up with the n here.

1830
02:45:31,000 --> 02:45:33,000
And that means the product is defined.

1831
02:45:33,000 --> 02:45:40,000
And then the product itself, the dimensions of it will be the first, the number of rows,

1832
02:45:40,000 --> 02:45:44,000
which is m by the number of columns of b.

1833
02:45:44,000 --> 02:45:47,000
So it will be m by p.

1834
02:45:47,000 --> 02:45:50,000
Okay, so how do we compute a times b?

1835
02:45:50,000 --> 02:45:53,000
Well, notice what this is.

1836
02:45:53,000 --> 02:45:59,000
It's the m by p matrix whose columns are a times b1 out to a times bp.

1837
02:45:59,000 --> 02:46:03,000
That is, we want to multiply a times b.

1838
02:46:03,000 --> 02:46:08,000
Then we look at it as a times each of the columns of b.

1839
02:46:08,000 --> 02:46:16,000
Okay, so the first entry, the first column of the product is a times the first column of b.

1840
02:46:16,000 --> 02:46:23,000
The second column of the product is a times the second column of b, and so forth.

1841
02:46:23,000 --> 02:46:33,000
So notice that each column of the product, each column of a, b, is of the form a times b1 or a times b2.

1842
02:46:33,000 --> 02:46:44,000
And we know that when we compute a times some column, then we are taking a linear combination of the columns of a

1843
02:46:44,000 --> 02:46:49,000
using the entries in the vector as the weights.

1844
02:46:49,000 --> 02:46:58,000
So to get the first column of a times b, we're taking a linear combination of the columns of a using the first column of b as the weights.

1845
02:46:58,000 --> 02:47:10,000
To get the second column, another linear combination of the columns of a using the entries in the second column of b as the weights, and so forth.

1846
02:47:10,000 --> 02:47:17,000
Okay, so if we want to compute the product a, b, where here are matrices a and b,

1847
02:47:17,000 --> 02:47:20,000
then we're going to do it as I just described.

1848
02:47:20,000 --> 02:47:26,000
First, note that a is a 3 by 2 matrix and b is 2 by 2.

1849
02:47:26,000 --> 02:47:30,000
So we check to see if the 2 here matches up with the 2 here, which it does.

1850
02:47:30,000 --> 02:47:40,000
And then we look at the outer dimensions, the 3 and the 2, and that will be the dimensions of the product.

1851
02:47:40,000 --> 02:47:43,000
So a product will be 3 by 2 in this case.

1852
02:47:44,000 --> 02:47:49,000
To get the first column of the product, it's a times the first column of b.

1853
02:47:49,000 --> 02:47:55,000
So here's a, first column of b, 4, negative 1, and this is just a linear combination.

1854
02:47:55,000 --> 02:48:00,000
So 4 times the first column of a minus 1 times the second column.

1855
02:48:00,000 --> 02:48:03,000
And this is what we get.

1856
02:48:03,000 --> 02:48:06,000
Do the same thing to get the second column of the product.

1857
02:48:06,000 --> 02:48:09,000
It's a times the second column of b.

1858
02:48:09,000 --> 02:48:12,000
Second column of b is 1, 8.

1859
02:48:12,000 --> 02:48:18,000
So we take that linear combination, 1 times this first column of a, plus 8 times the second column.

1860
02:48:18,000 --> 02:48:20,000
Do that linear combination.

1861
02:48:20,000 --> 02:48:25,000
And then we have our first and second columns of the product.

1862
02:48:25,000 --> 02:48:28,000
And so we're done.

1863
02:48:28,000 --> 02:48:33,000
There is a times b.

1864
02:48:33,000 --> 02:48:36,000
There's another way to compute a, b.

1865
02:48:36,000 --> 02:48:42,000
Probably most of you learned this when you took algebra, college algebra probably.

1866
02:48:42,000 --> 02:48:48,000
Notice that it's defined in terms of inner products.

1867
02:48:48,000 --> 02:48:59,000
So the i, jth entry in the product, a, b, is the inner product of row i of a with column j of b.

1868
02:48:59,000 --> 02:49:01,000
So let's see how that works.

1869
02:49:01,000 --> 02:49:04,000
So this is back to our same a and b.

1870
02:49:04,000 --> 02:49:17,000
And to get the 1, 1 entry in the product, then it's going to be row 1 of a times column 1 of b.

1871
02:49:17,000 --> 02:49:20,000
Actually, these should not be a's.

1872
02:49:20,000 --> 02:49:22,000
They should be the product.

1873
02:49:22,000 --> 02:49:24,000
I'm talking about the product here.

1874
02:49:24,000 --> 02:49:28,000
So row 1 of a times column 1 of b.

1875
02:49:28,000 --> 02:49:30,000
Do that inner product.

1876
02:49:30,000 --> 02:49:37,000
So it's going to be 3, 2 inner product with 4, negative 1 to give you 10 in this case.

1877
02:49:37,000 --> 02:49:38,000
And so forth.

1878
02:49:38,000 --> 02:49:46,000
So to get to the 3, 2 entry of the product, it's row 3 of a times column 2 of b.

1879
02:49:46,000 --> 02:49:50,000
So 5 times 1 plus 4 times 8.

1880
02:49:50,000 --> 02:49:52,000
It gives you 37.

1881
02:49:52,000 --> 02:49:53,000
So there you go.

1882
02:49:53,000 --> 02:50:01,000
You have the same matrix as we ended up with before.

1883
02:50:01,000 --> 02:50:02,000
Okay.

1884
02:50:02,000 --> 02:50:11,000
Now you should note that since matrix multiplication is not defined simply because it's not a simple operation like matrix addition is,

1885
02:50:11,000 --> 02:50:22,000
then properties of real numbers that apply to multiplication do not follow over to matrix multiplication.

1886
02:50:22,000 --> 02:50:24,000
They did with matrix addition.

1887
02:50:24,000 --> 02:50:27,000
They don't with matrix multiplication.

1888
02:50:27,000 --> 02:50:30,000
So some warnings.

1889
02:50:30,000 --> 02:50:35,000
If you're dealing with real numbers, a times b equals b times a.

1890
02:50:35,000 --> 02:50:38,000
That does not hold true for matrices.

1891
02:50:38,000 --> 02:50:42,000
A times b is not necessarily equal to b times a.

1892
02:50:42,000 --> 02:50:48,000
Of course it sometimes could be, but in general, a times b is not equal to b times a.

1893
02:50:48,000 --> 02:50:53,000
One thing, one reason is that sometimes they're not even both defined.

1894
02:50:53,000 --> 02:50:55,000
Not even both defined.

1895
02:50:55,000 --> 02:51:02,000
Maybe you can multiply a times b, but you might not be able to multiply b times a and vice versa.

1896
02:51:03,000 --> 02:51:09,000
However, even if they are both defined, you can't guarantee they'll be equal.

1897
02:51:09,000 --> 02:51:11,000
So here's an example.

1898
02:51:11,000 --> 02:51:16,000
Here's a matrix a times b, and we get this product.

1899
02:51:16,000 --> 02:51:21,000
If we reverse the order, multiply b times a, we get a totally different matrix.

1900
02:51:21,000 --> 02:51:30,000
So just because you can multiply both, compute both products, that doesn't mean that they'll be the same result.

1901
02:51:30,000 --> 02:51:34,000
So don't make that mistake.

1902
02:51:34,000 --> 02:51:36,000
Second warning.

1903
02:51:36,000 --> 02:51:43,000
For real numbers, if you know that a times b equals a times c, and you know that a is not equal to zero,

1904
02:51:43,000 --> 02:51:47,000
you can divide both sides by a and end up with b equals c.

1905
02:51:47,000 --> 02:51:50,000
You can't do that with matrices.

1906
02:51:50,000 --> 02:51:55,000
If a, b is ac, that doesn't mean that b equals c.

1907
02:51:55,000 --> 02:51:57,000
Okay, here's an example of that.

1908
02:51:57,000 --> 02:51:59,000
Here's a matrix a.

1909
02:51:59,000 --> 02:52:02,000
A times b is this matrix.

1910
02:52:02,000 --> 02:52:04,000
Here's a times c.

1911
02:52:04,000 --> 02:52:10,000
Get the same matrix, but b and c are clearly different.

1912
02:52:10,000 --> 02:52:12,000
And another one.

1913
02:52:12,000 --> 02:52:14,000
The last warning.

1914
02:52:14,000 --> 02:52:21,000
For real numbers, if a times b is equal to zero, you can assume that either a or b is equal to zero,

1915
02:52:21,000 --> 02:52:23,000
or perhaps both are equal to zero.

1916
02:52:23,000 --> 02:52:25,000
Not true for matrices.

1917
02:52:25,000 --> 02:52:29,000
You have a product of two matrices that equals a zero matrix.

1918
02:52:29,000 --> 02:52:33,000
That doesn't mean that a or b is equal to the zero matrix.

1919
02:52:33,000 --> 02:52:35,000
And here's an example of that.

1920
02:52:35,000 --> 02:52:39,000
Here's matrix a times b, and we end up with a zero matrix.

1921
02:52:39,000 --> 02:52:45,000
But neither of these is equal to the zero matrix, far from it, in fact.

1922
02:52:45,000 --> 02:52:50,000
Okay, some properties of matrix multiplication.

1923
02:52:50,000 --> 02:52:52,000
You have the associative property.

1924
02:52:52,000 --> 02:53:00,000
So you can move the parentheses around, but notice that the order that the matrices appear is unchanged.

1925
02:53:00,000 --> 02:53:06,000
Okay, so we can't move the, we can't change the order that the matrices appear.

1926
02:53:06,000 --> 02:53:11,000
Can change the order in which we do the multiplication.

1927
02:53:11,000 --> 02:53:16,000
We can distribute either from the left or from the right here in numbers two or three.

1928
02:53:16,000 --> 02:53:17,000
Oops.

1929
02:53:17,000 --> 02:53:18,000
Back, back, back.

1930
02:53:18,000 --> 02:53:19,000
Oops.

1931
02:53:19,000 --> 02:53:21,000
Sorry about that.

1932
02:53:21,000 --> 02:53:26,000
And if we have a scalar, we can move it wherever we'd like.

1933
02:53:26,000 --> 02:53:34,000
And apparently I thought that was quite an important thing since I've got an exclamation mark there.

1934
02:53:34,000 --> 02:53:39,000
And any matrix multiplied by the identity is just itself.

1935
02:53:39,000 --> 02:53:43,000
Now notice that I'm assuming a is m by n here.

1936
02:53:43,000 --> 02:53:47,000
So if I multiply on the left, I have to multiply by the m by m identity.

1937
02:53:47,000 --> 02:53:54,000
Whereas if I multiply on the right, I have to multiply by the n by n identity.

1938
02:53:54,000 --> 02:53:55,000
Okay.

1939
02:53:55,000 --> 02:54:10,000
One other thing, the transpose of a matrix is computed by taking the ijth entry of the original matrix,

1940
02:54:10,000 --> 02:54:14,000
and that becomes the j ith entry of the transpose.

1941
02:54:14,000 --> 02:54:23,000
So for example, if this is your matrix a, then I take the one one entry here becomes one one entry here.

1942
02:54:23,000 --> 02:54:27,000
One two entry becomes the two one entry and so forth.

1943
02:54:27,000 --> 02:54:33,000
I mean, perhaps an easier way to think of it is that the columns of a become the rows of a transpose.

1944
02:54:33,000 --> 02:54:40,000
So column one is three one five row one of the transpose three one five and so forth.

1945
02:54:40,000 --> 02:54:45,000
Or alternatively, the rows of a become the columns of the transpose.

1946
02:54:45,000 --> 02:54:51,000
So here's a row first row here three two first column here three two and so forth.

1947
02:54:51,000 --> 02:54:54,000
Some properties of the transpose.

1948
02:54:54,000 --> 02:54:59,000
If I take the transpose of the transpose of a matrix, I'm back where I started.

1949
02:54:59,000 --> 02:55:09,000
You can look here if I take the transpose of this matrix, then I end up with a row one here becomes column one of a and so forth.

1950
02:55:09,000 --> 02:55:14,000
So the transpose of the transpose is the original matrix.

1951
02:55:14,000 --> 02:55:26,000
Transpose of a sum is the sum of the transposes number two can move a scalar around number three number four kind of interesting.

1952
02:55:26,000 --> 02:55:36,000
If you want to take the transpose of a product that is the product of the transposes but in reverse order reverse order.

1953
02:55:36,000 --> 02:55:39,000
So here's an example of that.

1954
02:55:39,000 --> 02:55:43,000
If I want to compute the transpose of a product AB.

1955
02:55:43,000 --> 02:55:45,000
So here's a here's B.

1956
02:55:45,000 --> 02:55:49,000
I want to compute their products then take the transpose.

1957
02:55:49,000 --> 02:55:58,000
So I compute the product here it is transpose that and end up with this matrix.

1958
02:55:58,000 --> 02:56:00,000
Or I could do it this way.

1959
02:56:00,000 --> 02:56:06,000
Transpose each of them initially but reverse the order that I do the multiplication.

1960
02:56:06,000 --> 02:56:09,000
So here's B transpose right here's B up here.

1961
02:56:09,000 --> 02:56:11,000
So take the transpose that's here.

1962
02:56:11,000 --> 02:56:26,000
Here's a transpose and I compute that product and I get the same thing as I did previously.

1963
02:56:26,000 --> 02:56:30,000
Okay let's talk about the inverse of a matrix.

1964
02:56:30,000 --> 02:56:36,000
First let's go back and think about the inverse of just a scalar or real number a.

1965
02:56:36,000 --> 02:56:47,000
The multiplicative inverse as opposed to the additive inverse of a number a is just one over a assuming a is not equal to zero.

1966
02:56:47,000 --> 02:56:52,000
Because if we multiply a times one over a we get one or one over a times equals one.

1967
02:56:52,000 --> 02:56:57,000
And one is the identity element for multiplication.

1968
02:56:57,000 --> 02:57:00,000
We can use the same idea for matrices.

1969
02:57:00,000 --> 02:57:05,000
The inverse of a matrix a exists only under certain conditions.

1970
02:57:05,000 --> 02:57:13,000
So not every matrix has an inverse just like not every number has an inverse zero doesn't have an inverse.

1971
02:57:13,000 --> 02:57:20,000
Okay we're going to write the inverse of a as a with a superscript negative one.

1972
02:57:20,000 --> 02:57:29,000
And we have a times a inverse we just read this as a inverse equals the identity matrix.

1973
02:57:29,000 --> 02:57:33,000
Okay this is not the number one this is the identity matrix.

1974
02:57:33,000 --> 02:57:37,000
And also a inverse times a is the identity matrix.

1975
02:57:37,000 --> 02:57:43,000
Okay one of the requirements for a inverse to exist is that a is a square matrix.

1976
02:57:43,000 --> 02:57:53,000
Okay and you have to have that so that you can multiply on the left and on the right by the same matrix.

1977
02:57:53,000 --> 02:57:58,000
Okay let's start off by talking about finding the inverse of a two by two.

1978
02:57:58,000 --> 02:58:04,000
Okay in this case there happens to be a specific formula for the inverse.

1979
02:58:04,000 --> 02:58:09,000
So if we have a two by two matrix a that looks like this a, b, c, d.

1980
02:58:09,000 --> 02:58:16,000
Then a inverse exists if a times d minus b times c is not equal to zero.

1981
02:58:16,000 --> 02:58:26,000
Okay so that's a times d so multiply the elements on the main diagonal and subtract off the product of the elements on the off diagonal.

1982
02:58:26,000 --> 02:58:34,000
So a times d minus b times c I call it the crisscross applesauce a times d minus b times c.

1983
02:58:34,000 --> 02:58:40,000
Alright so if that's not zero a inverse exists and here's a formula for it.

1984
02:58:40,000 --> 02:58:46,000
Notice that we divide by a d minus b c that's why it has to be non-zero.

1985
02:58:46,000 --> 02:58:57,000
And then the matrix is formed from a by swapping the numbers in the a and d positions.

1986
02:58:57,000 --> 02:59:01,000
Okay so we swap a and d and negate d and c.

1987
02:59:01,000 --> 02:59:07,000
Okay so that's how I remember it and you swap a and d negate b and c.

1988
02:59:07,000 --> 02:59:10,000
So for example here's a matrix a.

1989
02:59:10,000 --> 02:59:21,000
If we look at the a d minus b c that's four times negative three so negative twelve minus negative nine times two that's negative eighteen.

1990
02:59:21,000 --> 02:59:27,000
So negative twelve minus negative eighteen would be negative twelve plus eighteen which is six.

1991
02:59:27,000 --> 02:59:35,000
So we're dividing one over six this thing here is six and then we swap the four and the negative three.

1992
02:59:35,000 --> 02:59:44,000
Okay they swap positions and negate the negative nine and two and then multiply that out and we get this matrix.

1993
02:59:44,000 --> 02:59:52,000
Okay so that's the inverse of a and if you check multiply a times a inverse you get the identity matrix.

1994
02:59:52,000 --> 02:59:59,000
If we multiply a inverse times a we also get the identity matrix.

1995
02:59:59,000 --> 03:00:05,000
Okay I also get another example here's another two by two matrix.

1996
03:00:05,000 --> 03:00:15,000
But oops in this case if we multiply the a d minus b c we got one times four minus two times two which gives us zero.

1997
03:00:15,000 --> 03:00:21,000
So that tells us that this matrix does not have an inverse.

1998
03:00:21,000 --> 03:00:28,000
And if you look at that matrix a little bit you see that the second column is just two times the first.

1999
03:00:28,000 --> 03:00:33,000
Okay those columns are multiples of each other so they're linearly dependent.

2000
03:00:33,000 --> 03:00:40,000
If we look at a in reduced echelon form it has a row of all zeros.

2001
03:00:40,000 --> 03:00:50,000
We have a free variable to the point we say that a is not row equivalent to the identity matrix.

2002
03:00:50,000 --> 03:00:59,000
And it turns out that if a any matrix a if it's not row equivalent to the identity matrix then it will not be invertible.

2003
03:00:59,000 --> 03:01:08,000
And if it is row equivalent to the identity matrix it will be invertible.

2004
03:01:08,000 --> 03:01:13,000
We don't have a formula for the inverse of a three by three.

2005
03:01:13,000 --> 03:01:21,000
So we need to develop a method for computing the inverse or for determining that the inverse does not exist.

2006
03:01:21,000 --> 03:01:30,000
So what we'd like to do is find a matrix let's just call it b such that a times b is equal to the identity matrix.

2007
03:01:30,000 --> 03:01:36,000
Okay so if we assume that a is n by n then that means that b also has to be n by n.

2008
03:01:36,000 --> 03:01:45,000
And we'll denote the columns of b by these column vectors b1, b2 through bn.

2009
03:01:45,000 --> 03:01:57,000
So recalling from the previous section if we multiply a times b we can write that in this form a times the matrix here's b.

2010
03:01:58,000 --> 03:02:07,000
And that equals just a times b1 in the first column, a times b2 in the second column and so forth.

2011
03:02:07,000 --> 03:02:23,000
So remember this that a times b you get the first column as a linear combination of the columns of a using the elements in b1 as the multipliers and so forth for the other columns.

2012
03:02:23,000 --> 03:02:29,000
So remember we want that to equal the identity matrix so here's the identity matrix.

2013
03:02:29,000 --> 03:02:38,000
So we want a times b1 to be the first column of the identity matrix, a times b2 to be the second column and so forth.

2014
03:02:38,000 --> 03:02:46,000
So in order to determine the matrix b here we need to solve n systems of equations.

2015
03:02:47,000 --> 03:02:55,000
So if we solve those n systems of equations we'll have an inverse if it exists.

2016
03:02:55,000 --> 03:03:02,000
So let's look at this matrix and see if we can follow that method.

2017
03:03:02,000 --> 03:03:10,000
It's a 2 by 2 so we could just use the formula we have but let's try applying this method that we just discussed.

2018
03:03:10,000 --> 03:03:16,000
So a times b, a times b1, a times b2 and we want that to equal the identity matrix.

2019
03:03:16,000 --> 03:03:24,000
So we have these two systems to solve, a times b1 is 1, 0, a times b2 is 0, 1.

2020
03:03:24,000 --> 03:03:34,000
So here we go to solve this system, set up an augmented matrix, do some row operations,

2021
03:03:34,000 --> 03:03:43,000
and notice that a, to this point you see that a is row equivalent to the identity matrix so that means that a inverse does exist.

2022
03:03:43,000 --> 03:03:51,000
And here's the first column, b1 is negative one half three half so that's the first column of the inverse.

2023
03:03:51,000 --> 03:04:00,000
And to get the second column we solve this system, a times b2 equals 0, 1, the second column of the identity matrix.

2024
03:04:00,000 --> 03:04:15,000
And again I set up my augmented matrix, tack on 0, 1, do some row operations, and notice that the row operations that I'm doing here are exactly the same ones that I did up here.

2025
03:04:15,000 --> 03:04:19,000
So first multiply row 1 by 1 fourth, same thing down here.

2026
03:04:19,000 --> 03:04:24,000
Then 9 times row 1 plus row 2, same as down here and so forth.

2027
03:04:24,000 --> 03:04:27,000
And that carries through the whole way.

2028
03:04:27,000 --> 03:04:39,000
And if you give that some thought, you'd say oh yeah that makes sense because the row operations that I'm doing are based on the entries in a.

2029
03:04:39,000 --> 03:04:42,000
I'm trying to get a in reduced echelon form.

2030
03:04:42,000 --> 03:04:52,000
So since a doesn't change, same a here and up here, then it makes sense that the row operations I do don't change.

2031
03:04:52,000 --> 03:04:56,000
The only thing that's changed is what's in the last column.

2032
03:04:56,000 --> 03:05:01,000
And so we end up with this for b2.

2033
03:05:01,000 --> 03:05:08,000
So I've got my two columns of b which is what the inverse of a is.

2034
03:05:08,000 --> 03:05:16,000
And if you look at this you think well that seems like to be a lot of repetitive work and it is.

2035
03:05:16,000 --> 03:05:24,000
And so we have a more efficient method and that is to solve both systems at one time.

2036
03:05:24,000 --> 03:05:37,000
So instead of just tacking on one column in an augmented matrix, we tack on both columns or the whole identity matrix depending on what size your original matrix is.

2037
03:05:37,000 --> 03:05:46,000
And here we go through that same sequence of row operations and we end up with the two columns of b that we found earlier.

2038
03:05:46,000 --> 03:05:51,000
And this of course is the inverse of a.

2039
03:05:51,000 --> 03:06:04,000
Now in general what this looks like is you start off with this matrix a on one side then augment on the identity matrix.

2040
03:06:04,000 --> 03:06:11,000
And you do row operations until you get a in reduced echelon form.

2041
03:06:11,000 --> 03:06:15,000
And what you're aiming for is to make it look like the identity matrix.

2042
03:06:15,000 --> 03:06:20,000
And they said that may or may not be possible depending on a.

2043
03:06:20,000 --> 03:06:29,000
If it is then you'll end up with the identity matrix here and the inverse of a on the right.

2044
03:06:30,000 --> 03:06:33,000
So that's what you're aiming for.

2045
03:06:33,000 --> 03:06:40,000
And just while we're here looking at this, notice that we could go backwards because we know that all these row operations are reversible.

2046
03:06:40,000 --> 03:06:43,000
We could go backwards and look what happens.

2047
03:06:43,000 --> 03:06:52,000
We start off with a inverse with the identity tacked on and we get back here and we can make a inverse look like the identity matrix.

2048
03:06:53,000 --> 03:07:06,000
And so with a over here so that tells you that if you wanted to take the inverse of a inverse then you just get the original matrix a back.

2049
03:07:06,000 --> 03:07:11,000
So the inverse of a inverse is just a.

2050
03:07:11,000 --> 03:07:14,000
Okay so what happens if a is not invertible?

2051
03:07:14,000 --> 03:07:19,000
In this case it's not row equivalent to the identity.

2052
03:07:19,000 --> 03:07:23,000
So here's the example we had before where the second column is a multiple of the first.

2053
03:07:23,000 --> 03:07:26,000
Tack on the identity matrix.

2054
03:07:26,000 --> 03:07:33,000
Do one row operation here and you get to this point and you say a is not row equivalent to the identity matrix.

2055
03:07:33,000 --> 03:07:39,000
And hence I can't get it in this form where I've got the identity and then a inverse.

2056
03:07:39,000 --> 03:07:45,000
That tells you that the matrix a does not have an inverse.

2057
03:07:45,000 --> 03:07:54,000
Okay so if you can't get a to look like the identity matrix by doing row operations then a is not invertible.

2058
03:07:54,000 --> 03:07:58,000
Or a inverse does not exist.

2059
03:07:58,000 --> 03:08:06,000
Alright now this method works no matter what size your matrix is so I scaled it up for a three by three.

2060
03:08:06,000 --> 03:08:13,000
Okay start off with this matrix a and tack on the three by three identity matrix.

2061
03:08:13,000 --> 03:08:18,000
And go through some row operations.

2062
03:08:18,000 --> 03:08:21,000
A lot of arithmetic here.

2063
03:08:21,000 --> 03:08:28,000
And if you look at the last matrix I have here the first three columns look like the identity matrix.

2064
03:08:28,000 --> 03:08:33,000
And so sitting over here would be the inverse of a.

2065
03:08:33,000 --> 03:08:42,000
Alright so this last three columns would be the inverse of my matrix a.

2066
03:08:42,000 --> 03:08:49,000
If you know a inverse then solving a x equals b is trivial.

2067
03:08:49,000 --> 03:08:55,000
Alright because our whole focus in this course is solving a x equals b solving systems of equations.

2068
03:08:55,000 --> 03:09:07,000
And so if you know a inverse then it turns out that it's super simple to solve a system of equations involving a.

2069
03:09:07,000 --> 03:09:10,000
And basically here's the rationale.

2070
03:09:10,000 --> 03:09:13,000
Start off with a x equals b.

2071
03:09:13,000 --> 03:09:19,000
And you know a inverse exists and that means you can multiply both sides of your system by a inverse.

2072
03:09:19,000 --> 03:09:21,000
So I do that.

2073
03:09:21,000 --> 03:09:28,000
And the reason to do that is because if you look over here we can re-associate the parentheses.

2074
03:09:28,000 --> 03:09:32,000
And so we can end up with a inverse times a together.

2075
03:09:32,000 --> 03:09:36,000
And the advantage of that is that that equals the identity matrix.

2076
03:09:36,000 --> 03:09:40,000
So we end up with just the identity matrix times x.

2077
03:09:40,000 --> 03:09:44,000
And anything times the identity matrix is just that anything.

2078
03:09:44,000 --> 03:09:46,000
So i times x is x.

2079
03:09:46,000 --> 03:09:48,000
So x is simply a inverse b.

2080
03:09:48,000 --> 03:09:52,000
So if you know a inverse then you don't need to do row operations.

2081
03:09:52,000 --> 03:09:54,000
You don't need to do any of that stuff.

2082
03:09:54,000 --> 03:09:59,000
Just multiply a inverse times b and you have the solution to your system.

2083
03:09:59,000 --> 03:10:03,000
Clearly that's going to save you a lot of work if you have a inverse.

2084
03:10:03,000 --> 03:10:08,000
So if I have this matrix a and this vector b and I want to solve a x equals b.

2085
03:10:08,000 --> 03:10:13,000
If I don't know a inverse then I got to go through you know set up my augmented matrix.

2086
03:10:13,000 --> 03:10:15,000
Do all these row operations.

2087
03:10:15,000 --> 03:10:21,000
And I end up here with my solution for negative 7, negative 16.

2088
03:10:21,000 --> 03:10:25,000
But if I know a inverse.

2089
03:10:25,000 --> 03:10:27,000
So I know a inverse.

2090
03:10:27,000 --> 03:10:30,000
So here's a here's b and I know a inverse.

2091
03:10:30,000 --> 03:10:32,000
Then to solve a x equals b.

2092
03:10:32,000 --> 03:10:35,000
As I said just multiply a inverse times b.

2093
03:10:35,000 --> 03:10:38,000
And here's your solution.

2094
03:10:38,000 --> 03:10:44,000
So back went through all this work to get 4, negative 7, negative 16.

2095
03:10:44,000 --> 03:10:50,000
If you know a inverse all you do is simple multiply matrix times a vector.

2096
03:10:50,000 --> 03:10:52,000
And you have the solution.

2097
03:10:52,000 --> 03:10:58,000
Now of course the downside is that most of the time you don't have a inverse.

2098
03:10:58,000 --> 03:11:05,000
And to get a inverse well you saw what work is required in that.

2099
03:11:05,000 --> 03:11:10,000
More work than simply going back and through to do this.

2100
03:11:10,000 --> 03:11:17,000
Because to find a inverse for a 3 by 3 we had to solve let's go back right.

2101
03:11:17,000 --> 03:11:21,000
We had to solve three systems of equations.

2102
03:11:21,000 --> 03:11:27,000
Just to solve this system you need to solve one system of equations.

2103
03:11:27,000 --> 03:11:34,000
But if you know a inverse then solving system is trivial.

2104
03:11:34,000 --> 03:11:37,000
Okay let's see.

2105
03:11:37,000 --> 03:11:40,000
Your book lists some properties of matrix inverses.

2106
03:11:40,000 --> 03:11:42,000
This one we've already talked about.

2107
03:11:42,000 --> 03:11:46,000
Take the inverse of a inverse you get a back.

2108
03:11:46,000 --> 03:11:49,000
If you have the inverse of a product.

2109
03:11:49,000 --> 03:11:51,000
So a b quantity inverse.

2110
03:11:51,000 --> 03:11:56,000
That is the product of the inverses.

2111
03:11:56,000 --> 03:11:58,000
But in reverse order.

2112
03:11:58,000 --> 03:12:00,000
So b inverse times a inverse.

2113
03:12:00,000 --> 03:12:03,000
Instead of a inverse times b inverse.

2114
03:12:03,000 --> 03:12:07,000
And if you take the inverse of a transpose of a matrix.

2115
03:12:07,000 --> 03:12:20,000
That's equivalent to transposing the inverse.

2116
03:12:20,000 --> 03:12:25,000
Okay the main part of section 2.3 is the invertible matrix theorem.

2117
03:12:25,000 --> 03:12:32,000
And this theorem actually ties together everything that we've done so far in the course actually.

2118
03:12:32,000 --> 03:12:39,000
Everything in chapter 1 and up through chapter 2 where we are.

2119
03:12:39,000 --> 03:12:45,000
So this theorem says if you have a given n by n matrix a.

2120
03:12:45,000 --> 03:12:47,000
The following are equivalent.

2121
03:12:47,000 --> 03:12:52,000
That means that they're either all true or all false.

2122
03:12:52,000 --> 03:12:54,000
Okay the first two look like this.

2123
03:12:54,000 --> 03:12:57,000
One a is an invertible matrix.

2124
03:12:57,000 --> 03:13:01,000
And number two a is row equivalent to the identity matrix.

2125
03:13:01,000 --> 03:13:07,000
So that should make sense because the way we found out if a is invertible.

2126
03:13:07,000 --> 03:13:13,000
Is to do those row operations and try to get it in the form of the identity matrix.

2127
03:13:13,000 --> 03:13:16,000
And if we could do that then that means a is invertible.

2128
03:13:16,000 --> 03:13:21,000
If we couldn't do that then a is not invertible.

2129
03:13:21,000 --> 03:13:25,000
Okay another statement a has n pivot positions.

2130
03:13:25,000 --> 03:13:30,000
So this is actually the key to the whole theorem in my opinion.

2131
03:13:30,000 --> 03:13:38,000
Everything here you can relate to pivot positions and that's how I would recommend that you approach this.

2132
03:13:38,000 --> 03:13:44,000
So looking ahead you need to know what this theorem says.

2133
03:13:44,000 --> 03:13:48,000
You need to be able to write down parts of this theorem.

2134
03:13:48,000 --> 03:13:56,000
I don't suggest that you memorize it because I think that's somewhat difficult.

2135
03:13:56,000 --> 03:14:03,000
But I don't so don't memorize it unless that works for you.

2136
03:14:03,000 --> 03:14:09,000
But the way I would suggest that you remember it is to relate everything back to pivot positions.

2137
03:14:09,000 --> 03:14:13,000
Because that's what we've done up to now and that should still work for you.

2138
03:14:13,000 --> 03:14:15,000
So let's look at these next three.

2139
03:14:15,000 --> 03:14:21,000
And number four says the equation ax equals zero has only the trivial solution.

2140
03:14:22,000 --> 03:14:31,000
Okay so if it has only the trivial solution then that means that there are no free variables.

2141
03:14:31,000 --> 03:14:34,000
That means every column of a is a pivot column.

2142
03:14:34,000 --> 03:14:39,000
And so that means since there are n columns there's n pivot columns.

2143
03:14:39,000 --> 03:14:41,000
So n pivot positions.

2144
03:14:41,000 --> 03:14:44,000
Okay so that relates back to pivot positions.

2145
03:14:44,000 --> 03:14:48,000
Number five the columns are linearly independent.

2146
03:14:48,000 --> 03:14:49,000
How do we know that?

2147
03:14:49,000 --> 03:14:56,000
Well again no free variables so pivot position in every column are in pivot positions.

2148
03:14:56,000 --> 03:15:00,000
And number six the transformation x to ax is one to one.

2149
03:15:00,000 --> 03:15:02,000
And how do we know that?

2150
03:15:02,000 --> 03:15:09,000
Well that means we want to have a unique solution to every system ax equals b.

2151
03:15:09,000 --> 03:15:11,000
Or at most one solution.

2152
03:15:11,000 --> 03:15:16,000
They know multiple solutions for any right hand side.

2153
03:15:16,000 --> 03:15:19,000
So that means that we can't have any free variables.

2154
03:15:19,000 --> 03:15:22,000
So again pivot position in every column.

2155
03:15:22,000 --> 03:15:28,000
So four, five, and six all relate to the fact that you need a pivot position in every column.

2156
03:15:28,000 --> 03:15:34,000
These next four relate to having a pivot position in every row.

2157
03:15:34,000 --> 03:15:43,000
Okay which again since it's an n by n matrix that would mean you have n pivot positions.

2158
03:15:43,000 --> 03:15:49,000
So number seven says ax equals b has at least one solution for each b and rn.

2159
03:15:49,000 --> 03:15:54,000
So if that's straight that means that system is consistent no matter what the right hand side is.

2160
03:15:54,000 --> 03:15:58,000
That only happens when you have a pivot position in every row.

2161
03:15:58,000 --> 03:16:02,000
N rows means n pivot positions.

2162
03:16:02,000 --> 03:16:04,000
Columns of a span are n.

2163
03:16:04,000 --> 03:16:09,000
Okay that again means that there's a pivot position in every row.

2164
03:16:09,000 --> 03:16:14,000
But no matter what you put on the right side the system will be consistent.

2165
03:16:14,000 --> 03:16:18,000
So again pivot position every row so n pivot positions.

2166
03:16:18,000 --> 03:16:23,000
And number nine x to ax is on to rn.

2167
03:16:23,000 --> 03:16:30,000
So that means again there's a solution no matter what the right hand side of the system ax equals b is.

2168
03:16:30,000 --> 03:16:35,000
So there has to be a pivot position in every row.

2169
03:16:35,000 --> 03:16:38,000
And then last a transpose is invertible.

2170
03:16:38,000 --> 03:16:45,000
It's kind of a tag along there but if a is invertible a transpose is invertible.

2171
03:16:45,000 --> 03:16:54,000
Okay so I've taken a few of the even numbered problems from this section just to kind of talk through those

2172
03:16:54,000 --> 03:16:59,000
to give you an idea about how to go through some of the logic here.

2173
03:16:59,000 --> 03:17:00,000
So here's one.

2174
03:17:00,000 --> 03:17:08,000
Is it possible for a five by five matrix to be invertible when its columns do not span r5?

2175
03:17:08,000 --> 03:17:10,000
Okay well let's see.

2176
03:17:10,000 --> 03:17:18,000
If the columns don't span r5 then that means that there's not a pivot position in every row.

2177
03:17:18,000 --> 03:17:22,000
And that means that the matrix is not row equivalent to the identity matrix.

2178
03:17:22,000 --> 03:17:28,000
Or you could say that there's less than five pivot positions.

2179
03:17:28,000 --> 03:17:38,000
Either one of those gets you to the matrix cannot be invertible.

2180
03:17:38,000 --> 03:17:40,000
Alright here's one.

2181
03:17:40,000 --> 03:17:49,000
Got a six by six matrix and the equation cx equals v is consistent for every v in r6.

2182
03:17:49,000 --> 03:17:56,000
Is it possible that for some v the equation cx equals v has more than one solution?

2183
03:17:56,000 --> 03:18:07,000
Okay well if cx equals v is consistent for every v in r6 then that means that there must be a pivot position in every row.

2184
03:18:07,000 --> 03:18:17,000
And since this is a square matrix if there's a pivot position in every row then there's also one in every column.

2185
03:18:17,000 --> 03:18:22,000
And if there's a pivot position in every column that means there's no free variables.

2186
03:18:22,000 --> 03:18:31,000
And so hence any system will, there will be no system that has an infinite number of solutions.

2187
03:18:31,000 --> 03:18:34,000
Only a unique solution.

2188
03:18:34,000 --> 03:18:45,000
Alright let's suppose h is n by n and the equation hx equals c is inconsistent for some c.

2189
03:18:45,000 --> 03:18:52,000
Does the system hx equals zero have non-trivial solutions?

2190
03:18:52,000 --> 03:19:02,000
Well if hx equals c is inconsistent for some right hand side then there can't be a pivot position in every row.

2191
03:19:02,000 --> 03:19:08,000
And that means that there can't be a pivot position in every column since h is a square matrix.

2192
03:19:08,000 --> 03:19:12,000
And if there's not a pivot position in every column then that means you have free variables.

2193
03:19:12,000 --> 03:19:20,000
And hence there are non-trivial solutions to hx equals zero.

2194
03:19:20,000 --> 03:19:22,000
Okay another one.

2195
03:19:22,000 --> 03:19:28,000
If l is n by n and lx equals zero has only the trivial solution.

2196
03:19:28,000 --> 03:19:31,000
Do the columns of l span rn?

2197
03:19:31,000 --> 03:19:37,000
Well if lx equals zero has only the trivial solution then that means there's no free variables.

2198
03:19:37,000 --> 03:19:47,000
So we have a pivot position in every column of l which means we have a pivot position in every row of l since l is square.

2199
03:19:47,000 --> 03:19:55,000
And if there's a pivot position in every row then that means that the columns span rn.

2200
03:19:55,000 --> 03:20:00,000
Alright let's talk about invertible linear transformations.

2201
03:20:00,000 --> 03:20:08,000
Let's suppose we have a linear transformation t from rn to rn that's defined by the matrix a.

2202
03:20:08,000 --> 03:20:12,000
So a here would be n by n.

2203
03:20:12,000 --> 03:20:17,000
Alright for any x we can compute ax right?

2204
03:20:17,000 --> 03:20:23,000
For any x we can compute t of x or a times x.

2205
03:20:23,000 --> 03:20:26,000
Let's think about going backwards though.

2206
03:20:26,000 --> 03:20:39,000
Suppose you have some b and you would like to know is there a unique vector x such that ax equals b?

2207
03:20:39,000 --> 03:20:52,000
Okay so think of b as being in the co-domain and we want to go backwards to see what x mapped to that b.

2208
03:20:52,000 --> 03:20:57,000
Well this works if t is both one to one and onto.

2209
03:20:57,000 --> 03:21:10,000
Okay so for us to be able to go backwards and find out what x mapped to b we can do that if we know that t is one to one and onto.

2210
03:21:10,000 --> 03:21:12,000
Okay so why is that?

2211
03:21:12,000 --> 03:21:21,000
Well if t is onto then that means that every b and rn is mapped to by at least one x.

2212
03:21:21,000 --> 03:21:25,000
Every b is mapped to by at least one x.

2213
03:21:25,000 --> 03:21:31,000
So that means that if we go backward there's an x to go back to.

2214
03:21:31,000 --> 03:21:38,000
If it's one to one then that means that every b is mapped to by at most one x.

2215
03:21:38,000 --> 03:21:41,000
Every b is mapped to by at most one x.

2216
03:21:41,000 --> 03:21:47,000
So that means that if we can go backwards there's only one vector to go backwards to.

2217
03:21:47,000 --> 03:21:51,000
We don't have multiple vectors mapping to the same b.

2218
03:21:51,000 --> 03:22:00,000
So if you put those two things together t is one to one and onto then every b is mapped to by exactly one x.

2219
03:22:00,000 --> 03:22:04,000
Which means there's a unique solution.

2220
03:22:04,000 --> 03:22:06,000
So how do we find that x?

2221
03:22:06,000 --> 03:22:12,000
Given a particular vector b how do we find out what x mapped to it?

2222
03:22:12,000 --> 03:22:26,000
Well we need to solve ax equals b and the way to do that if we know that a is invertible is to simply multiply a inverse times b.

2223
03:22:26,000 --> 03:22:33,000
So the matrix that defines the inverse transformation t inverse is simply a inverse.

2224
03:22:33,000 --> 03:22:50,000
So a takes you forward from x you multiply a times x to get b in the co-domain to go backwards to reverse that.

2225
03:22:50,000 --> 03:22:53,000
You multiply by a inverse.

2226
03:22:53,000 --> 03:23:00,000
So t is defined by a, t inverse is defined by a inverse.

2227
03:23:01,000 --> 03:23:04,000
Another way to look at it is this.

2228
03:23:04,000 --> 03:23:14,000
Under what conditions does there exist a unique vector x such that ax equals b for every b in our n?

2229
03:23:14,000 --> 03:23:25,000
When can we know that the system ax equals b is always consistent and always has a unique solution?

2230
03:23:25,000 --> 03:23:30,000
Well it's consistent if there's a pivot position in every row of a.

2231
03:23:30,000 --> 03:23:37,000
Ax equals b is consistent for every b if there's a pivot position in every row of a.

2232
03:23:37,000 --> 03:23:42,000
And if the solution is unique then there has to be no free variables.

2233
03:23:42,000 --> 03:23:46,000
So that means there has to be a pivot position in every column of a.

2234
03:23:46,000 --> 03:23:51,000
So backing up it's consistent.

2235
03:23:51,000 --> 03:23:55,000
If it's consistent for every b we have to have a pivot position in every row.

2236
03:23:55,000 --> 03:24:03,000
If there's a unique solution then that means we have no free variables so we have to have a pivot position in every column.

2237
03:24:03,000 --> 03:24:12,000
So t of x equals ax is invertible when a has a pivot position in every row and column.

2238
03:24:12,000 --> 03:24:19,000
i.e. when a has n pivot positions i.e. when a is invertible.

2239
03:24:26,000 --> 03:24:29,000
Okay we're going to talk about determinants.

2240
03:24:29,000 --> 03:24:39,000
The determinant of a matrix is just a scalar value that is associated with any square matrix.

2241
03:24:39,000 --> 03:24:44,000
So we only talk about the determinant of a square matrix.

2242
03:24:44,000 --> 03:24:58,000
The notation is d e t of a or sometimes you see it with a looks like absolute value of a with the vertical bars around a.

2243
03:24:58,000 --> 03:25:05,000
We've actually already seen the determinant in the 2 by 2 case.

2244
03:25:05,000 --> 03:25:13,000
If we have a is just this generic matrix a b c d then the determinant of a is a times d minus b times c.

2245
03:25:13,000 --> 03:25:21,000
And we've seen that because we saw that in the little formula for the inverse of a 2 by 2.

2246
03:25:21,000 --> 03:25:27,000
So remember we multiplied by 1 over a d minus b c.

2247
03:25:27,000 --> 03:25:31,000
So we're multiplying by 1 over the determinant of the matrix.

2248
03:25:31,000 --> 03:25:38,000
And then we kind of rearrange the terms and negate couple to get the inverse of a matrix.

2249
03:25:38,000 --> 03:25:50,000
So notice that at least in the case of a 2 by 2 matrix we can see that the inverse exists when the determinant of the matrix is not equal to 0.

2250
03:25:50,000 --> 03:25:57,000
Here in this case if a d minus b c is equal to 0 then a inverse does not exist.

2251
03:25:57,000 --> 03:26:01,000
And it turns out that this is true for any square matrix.

2252
03:26:01,000 --> 03:26:09,000
If the determinant is not equal to 0 that means the matrix is invertible and it's invertible then the determinant is not equal to 0.

2253
03:26:09,000 --> 03:26:19,000
So this is actually another installment in the invertible matrix theorem which we had from section 2.3.

2254
03:26:19,000 --> 03:26:28,000
So determinant of a not equal to 0 is logically equivalent to a is invertible.

2255
03:26:28,000 --> 03:26:36,000
Alright if we move up beyond a 2 by 2 there's no nice formula for competing the determinant like there was for a 2 by 2.

2256
03:26:36,000 --> 03:26:40,000
And we use a method called cofactor expansion.

2257
03:26:40,000 --> 03:26:47,000
And this method works for any size matrix 3 by 3 on up.

2258
03:26:47,000 --> 03:26:52,000
In this method we have to choose a row or column to expand about.

2259
03:26:52,000 --> 03:26:56,000
That's what we call it. We're going to choose a row or column to expand about.

2260
03:26:56,000 --> 03:27:05,000
You'll see as we go on that it's advantageous to choose a row or column that has the most zeros in it because that eliminates some of the terms.

2261
03:27:05,000 --> 03:27:12,000
But for our first cut here I'm just going to expand about the first row.

2262
03:27:12,000 --> 03:27:19,000
And I've kind of color coded this to make it easier for you to see where the terms come from.

2263
03:27:19,000 --> 03:27:25,000
Okay so if we expand about the first row we start with the first entry which is the 5.

2264
03:27:25,000 --> 03:27:37,000
And then we multiply 5 by the determinant of the matrix that you're left with if you eliminate the row or column that contains the 5.

2265
03:27:37,000 --> 03:27:47,000
So if you eliminate the first row and eliminate the first column then you see that you have this little 2 by 2 matrix that's sitting right here.

2266
03:27:47,000 --> 03:27:50,000
And so we're going to take the determinant of that.

2267
03:27:50,000 --> 03:27:55,000
And then we move over to the next entry in the first row which is the 2.

2268
03:27:55,000 --> 03:28:04,000
And we multiply that by the determinant of the matrix that you get if you eliminate the first row and the second column.

2269
03:28:04,000 --> 03:28:07,000
Okay the row and the column containing the 2.

2270
03:28:07,000 --> 03:28:13,000
So we're left with the 0, 2 here and the negative 5, 7 here.

2271
03:28:13,000 --> 03:28:16,000
Okay so that's how we get this matrix here.

2272
03:28:16,000 --> 03:28:19,000
Then we continue moving across the first row.

2273
03:28:19,000 --> 03:28:28,000
Then we've got a 4 and we multiply 4 by the matrix that you get if you eliminate the first row and the third column.

2274
03:28:28,000 --> 03:28:30,000
Okay eliminate the row and the column containing the 4.

2275
03:28:30,000 --> 03:28:35,000
So you're left with this little 2 by 2 here, 0, 3, 2, negative 4.

2276
03:28:35,000 --> 03:28:37,000
And that's what we have here.

2277
03:28:37,000 --> 03:28:40,000
Now notice I haven't combined these terms at all.

2278
03:28:40,000 --> 03:28:42,000
I've just written them out here.

2279
03:28:42,000 --> 03:28:47,000
And that's because there's a method for combining the terms.

2280
03:28:47,000 --> 03:28:50,000
Okay we have to put them together somehow.

2281
03:28:50,000 --> 03:29:01,000
And basically you apply a coefficient to each term which is negative 1 to the i plus j.

2282
03:29:01,000 --> 03:29:07,000
Where i and j are the row and column indices corresponding to that term.

2283
03:29:07,000 --> 03:29:13,000
So if we look back up to the 5, 5 came from row 1 column 1.

2284
03:29:13,000 --> 03:29:18,000
So the coefficient that we put in front of that term is minus 1 to the 1 plus 1.

2285
03:29:18,000 --> 03:29:21,000
Because 5 came from row 1 column 1.

2286
03:29:21,000 --> 03:29:29,000
Alright then for the next term, this one, the 2, the blue term, came from this entry here.

2287
03:29:29,000 --> 03:29:33,000
The 2 is in the first row second column.

2288
03:29:33,000 --> 03:29:37,000
So that means the coefficient here is minus 1 to the 1 plus 2.

2289
03:29:37,000 --> 03:29:41,000
Row 1 column 2, that's where the 1 plus 2 comes from.

2290
03:29:41,000 --> 03:29:48,000
And then for the 4, the green term, it's in the first row third column.

2291
03:29:48,000 --> 03:29:56,000
So we have minus 1 to the 1 plus 3 as the coefficient in front of that term.

2292
03:29:56,000 --> 03:30:04,000
And so if we multiply and add, then we get minus 1 to the 1 plus 1.

2293
03:30:04,000 --> 03:30:06,000
So that's minus 1 squared.

2294
03:30:06,000 --> 03:30:08,000
So that's just plus 1 times 5.

2295
03:30:08,000 --> 03:30:10,000
So we bring down 5.

2296
03:30:10,000 --> 03:30:13,000
And the determinant here, remember it's just the crisscross.

2297
03:30:13,000 --> 03:30:17,000
3 times 7 minus negative 4 times negative 5.

2298
03:30:17,000 --> 03:30:19,000
So that's what we have here.

2299
03:30:19,000 --> 03:30:22,000
Alright, then moving on here to the blue.

2300
03:30:22,000 --> 03:30:24,000
We got minus 1 to the 1 plus 2.

2301
03:30:24,000 --> 03:30:26,000
That's minus 1 cubed.

2302
03:30:26,000 --> 03:30:29,000
So that's negative 1 times 2.

2303
03:30:29,000 --> 03:30:32,000
Gives us the negative 2 here.

2304
03:30:32,000 --> 03:30:38,000
Times the determinant which is 0 times 7 minus 2 times negative 5.

2305
03:30:38,000 --> 03:30:43,000
Alright, then moving over to the next term, the green one comes from the 4.

2306
03:30:43,000 --> 03:30:45,000
And that's first row third column.

2307
03:30:45,000 --> 03:30:49,000
So that's the minus 1 to the 1 plus 3.

2308
03:30:49,000 --> 03:30:54,000
Which is minus 1 to the fourth, which is positive 1 times 4.

2309
03:30:54,000 --> 03:30:59,000
And so you get a plus 4 in front of that term.

2310
03:30:59,000 --> 03:31:05,000
Times the determinant which is 0 times negative 4 minus 2 times 3.

2311
03:31:05,000 --> 03:31:08,000
Alright, then combining a little more.

2312
03:31:08,000 --> 03:31:12,000
We got 21 minus 20 here.

2313
03:31:12,000 --> 03:31:14,000
Times 5.

2314
03:31:14,000 --> 03:31:17,000
Then we've got 0 plus 10.

2315
03:31:17,000 --> 03:31:19,000
So just a 10 there.

2316
03:31:19,000 --> 03:31:21,000
And then here's 0 minus 6.

2317
03:31:21,000 --> 03:31:23,000
So negative 6 there.

2318
03:31:23,000 --> 03:31:30,000
And we combine and we end up with negative 39 for the determinant of this matrix.

2319
03:31:30,000 --> 03:31:33,000
Okay, now just a little aside.

2320
03:31:33,000 --> 03:31:41,000
It's really not necessary to explicitly compute this minus 1 to the i plus j term every time.

2321
03:31:41,000 --> 03:31:44,000
If you just look, here's a 4 by 4.

2322
03:31:44,000 --> 03:31:49,000
Where I've put as the entries in the matrix just the row index plus the column index.

2323
03:31:49,000 --> 03:31:51,000
So 1, 1 position, we got 1 plus 1.

2324
03:31:51,000 --> 03:31:54,000
1, 2 position, 1 plus 2, and so forth.

2325
03:31:54,000 --> 03:31:58,000
So if we look at what that is, we end up with these numbers.

2326
03:31:58,000 --> 03:32:02,000
And remember we want minus 1 raised to each of these powers.

2327
03:32:02,000 --> 03:32:09,000
And so you can see since they all differ by one, going from one term to an adjacent term,

2328
03:32:09,000 --> 03:32:11,000
either in the same row or the same column,

2329
03:32:11,000 --> 03:32:15,000
you either go from an even number to an odd or an odd to an even.

2330
03:32:15,000 --> 03:32:21,000
So in any case, alternating terms are always going to have opposite signs.

2331
03:32:21,000 --> 03:32:26,000
And you always start off in the upper left with a plus, plus 1,

2332
03:32:26,000 --> 03:32:30,000
because that's minus 1 that the 1 plus 1 or minus 1 squared.

2333
03:32:30,000 --> 03:32:34,000
So you always know that the 1, 1 position is a plus term,

2334
03:32:34,000 --> 03:32:38,000
and then everything alternates after that.

2335
03:32:38,000 --> 03:32:40,000
So it's always plus, minus, plus, minus.

2336
03:32:40,000 --> 03:32:49,000
So if you know the sign that goes with the first term in the row or the column that you're expanding about,

2337
03:32:49,000 --> 03:32:53,000
then you only need to alternate terms after that.

2338
03:32:53,000 --> 03:32:56,000
So you always have this checkerboard patterns.

2339
03:32:56,000 --> 03:33:04,000
And you just need to alternate terms based on the sign of the position where you start.

2340
03:33:04,000 --> 03:33:09,000
So let's look at this matrix again.

2341
03:33:09,000 --> 03:33:14,000
It's the same one, but I'm going to expand about the second column this time,

2342
03:33:14,000 --> 03:33:16,000
just for something different.

2343
03:33:16,000 --> 03:33:21,000
Now, first note that the second column or the first entry there is the 2,

2344
03:33:21,000 --> 03:33:23,000
and it's in the 1, 2 position.

2345
03:33:23,000 --> 03:33:29,000
So minus 1 to the 1 plus 2, if you want to compete it like that, minus 1 cubed, that's a negative 1.

2346
03:33:29,000 --> 03:33:32,000
So this is a negative position here.

2347
03:33:32,000 --> 03:33:35,000
Or you can say, I always know that the 1, 1 position is a plus.

2348
03:33:35,000 --> 03:33:39,000
So this is plus, the next one over has to be a minus.

2349
03:33:39,000 --> 03:33:43,000
That's typically how I do it.

2350
03:33:43,000 --> 03:33:50,000
So we end up with minus 2 times, again, the determinant of the matrix that you get

2351
03:33:50,000 --> 03:33:53,000
if you eliminate the row and the column containing the 2.

2352
03:33:53,000 --> 03:33:56,000
So we end up with a 0, 2, negative 5, 7.

2353
03:33:56,000 --> 03:33:58,000
So that's where we end up with that matrix.

2354
03:33:58,000 --> 03:34:01,000
Alright, then we move to the 3.

2355
03:34:01,000 --> 03:34:05,000
Now since the 2 is a negative, the 3 is going to be a plus.

2356
03:34:05,000 --> 03:34:10,000
And we eliminate the row and the column containing the 3.

2357
03:34:10,000 --> 03:34:14,000
So we end up with 5, 4, 2, 7.

2358
03:34:14,000 --> 03:34:17,000
And then we move on to the negative 4.

2359
03:34:17,000 --> 03:34:22,000
So again, if you forget, we'll go back to the 1, 1, that's a plus.

2360
03:34:22,000 --> 03:34:24,000
Moving over, that's a minus.

2361
03:34:24,000 --> 03:34:26,000
Moving down, that's a plus.

2362
03:34:26,000 --> 03:34:28,000
Moving down again, that's a minus.

2363
03:34:28,000 --> 03:34:30,000
So we're going to subtract off.

2364
03:34:30,000 --> 03:34:32,000
That's where the minus comes from.

2365
03:34:32,000 --> 03:34:37,000
Minus negative 4 times the matrix that you get if you eliminate the last row in the middle column.

2366
03:34:37,000 --> 03:34:40,000
5, 0, 4, negative 5.

2367
03:34:40,000 --> 03:34:43,000
Alright, we compute those determinants.

2368
03:34:43,000 --> 03:34:47,000
Here we're going to have 0 times 7 minus 2 times negative 5.

2369
03:34:47,000 --> 03:34:50,000
Here 5 times 7 minus 2 times 4.

2370
03:34:50,000 --> 03:34:54,000
And here 5 times negative 5 minus 0 times 4.

2371
03:34:54,000 --> 03:34:58,000
And we can simplify.

2372
03:34:58,000 --> 03:35:02,000
And we end up with negative 39 again, which we should.

2373
03:35:02,000 --> 03:35:06,000
Because no matter which row or column you choose to expand about,

2374
03:35:06,000 --> 03:35:11,000
you should end up with the same answer.

2375
03:35:11,000 --> 03:35:17,000
Alright, let's move on to a 4 by 4.

2376
03:35:17,000 --> 03:35:23,000
Now we're going to take advantage of the fact that we've got a row with 3 zeros in it.

2377
03:35:23,000 --> 03:35:28,000
So I'm going to expand about the second row.

2378
03:35:28,000 --> 03:35:40,000
And if you notice the first entry in the second column.

2379
03:35:40,000 --> 03:35:41,000
Okay, there we go.

2380
03:35:41,000 --> 03:35:44,000
Expand about the second row to take advantage of the zeros.

2381
03:35:44,000 --> 03:35:51,000
So if we look, the 0 here is, or go back to the 1, that's a plus position.

2382
03:35:51,000 --> 03:35:53,000
So we move down, that's a minus.

2383
03:35:53,000 --> 03:35:59,000
So the first term is going to be minus 0 times the determinant of the matrix that you get

2384
03:35:59,000 --> 03:36:03,000
if you eliminate the second row in the first column.

2385
03:36:03,000 --> 03:36:09,000
So you can see how the first row is going to be negative 2, 5, 2.

2386
03:36:09,000 --> 03:36:10,000
That's what we get there.

2387
03:36:10,000 --> 03:36:16,000
Then we've got these two rows right here as the second two rows.

2388
03:36:16,000 --> 03:36:19,000
Alright, then we move over to the next entry.

2389
03:36:19,000 --> 03:36:21,000
Okay, plus here, minus.

2390
03:36:21,000 --> 03:36:27,000
This is a plus entry, so it's plus 0 times the determinant of the matrix that you get

2391
03:36:27,000 --> 03:36:31,000
when you eliminate the second row, second column.

2392
03:36:31,000 --> 03:36:38,000
Alright, then minus the next term, so minus 3 times the matrix that you get

2393
03:36:38,000 --> 03:36:42,000
if you eliminate second row, third column.

2394
03:36:42,000 --> 03:36:48,000
And then plus 0 times the determinant of the matrix that you get

2395
03:36:48,000 --> 03:36:52,000
when you eliminate the last column and the second row.

2396
03:36:52,000 --> 03:36:55,000
So that's where all these terms come from.

2397
03:36:55,000 --> 03:36:59,000
And you can see the advantage of choosing a row with a bunch of zeros

2398
03:36:59,000 --> 03:37:06,000
because the red term, the green term, and the orange term all just disappear

2399
03:37:06,000 --> 03:37:10,000
because they are all multiplied by 0.

2400
03:37:10,000 --> 03:37:17,000
The blue one though, we have to compute now a 3 by 3 determinant.

2401
03:37:17,000 --> 03:37:22,000
So we have negative 3 times the determinant of this matrix.

2402
03:37:22,000 --> 03:37:26,000
So we use the same method, choose a row or a column to expand about.

2403
03:37:26,000 --> 03:37:28,000
I chose the third row.

2404
03:37:28,000 --> 03:37:34,000
Okay, so I've got plus, minus, plus, 5's in a plus position.

2405
03:37:34,000 --> 03:37:39,000
So it's 5 times this 2 by 2 determinant here.

2406
03:37:39,000 --> 03:37:46,000
Then move over minus 0 times the 1, 2, 2, 5.

2407
03:37:46,000 --> 03:37:53,000
And then plus 4 times the determinant of this little matrix up here.

2408
03:37:53,000 --> 03:37:58,000
And then plus 0 because this term is multiplied by 0.

2409
03:37:58,000 --> 03:38:03,000
So you can see that everything simplifies except for this blue part.

2410
03:38:03,000 --> 03:38:08,000
And we go through and evaluate these determinants

2411
03:38:08,000 --> 03:38:12,000
and combine terms and simplify.

2412
03:38:12,000 --> 03:38:16,000
We end up with negative 6 for the determinant of this matrix.

2413
03:38:16,000 --> 03:38:21,000
Now just stop for a minute here and think about how much more work would have been required

2414
03:38:21,000 --> 03:38:24,000
if we didn't have any zeros in this matrix.

2415
03:38:24,000 --> 03:38:27,000
We would have had to done what we did with the blue part.

2416
03:38:27,000 --> 03:38:31,000
We would have had to do that for the red and the green and the orange.

2417
03:38:31,000 --> 03:38:37,000
So this turns into significant work fairly quickly.

2418
03:38:37,000 --> 03:38:44,000
Okay, it's a recursive method because, for example, to compute a 5 by 5 determinant,

2419
03:38:44,000 --> 03:38:47,000
you have to compute 5, 4 by 4 determinants.

2420
03:38:47,000 --> 03:38:49,000
Now this is assuming there's no zeros in the matrix.

2421
03:38:49,000 --> 03:38:55,000
So the worst case for a 5 by 5, you have to compute 5, 4 by 4 determinants.

2422
03:38:55,000 --> 03:39:01,000
And each of those 4 by 4 determinants requires competing 4, 3 by 3 determinants.

2423
03:39:01,000 --> 03:39:05,000
And each 3 by 3 means you have to compute 3, 2 by 2 determinants.

2424
03:39:05,000 --> 03:39:13,000
As you can see, this gets very work intensive very quickly.

2425
03:39:13,000 --> 03:39:17,000
The amount of work increases exponentially.

2426
03:39:17,000 --> 03:39:21,000
So clearly this method does not scale well at all.

2427
03:39:21,000 --> 03:39:28,000
As your matrix gets bigger, the amount of work required increases exponentially.

2428
03:39:28,000 --> 03:39:36,000
So it's not a good tool and a good method to use to compute the determinant for an arbitrary size matrix.

2429
03:39:36,000 --> 03:39:38,000
3 by 3 is okay.

2430
03:39:38,000 --> 03:39:47,000
4 by 4 really turns into too much work unless you've got some significant number of zeros there.

2431
03:39:47,000 --> 03:39:55,000
Okay, now let's go off on a little different tangent here for a bit.

2432
03:39:55,000 --> 03:40:00,000
Let's first define what a triangular matrix is.

2433
03:40:00,000 --> 03:40:08,000
A triangular matrix is a square matrix in which all the entries either above or below the main diagonal are zero.

2434
03:40:08,000 --> 03:40:11,000
Okay, so here are some examples.

2435
03:40:11,000 --> 03:40:17,000
I've highlighted the zeros in red just to make it clear.

2436
03:40:17,000 --> 03:40:22,000
The first one here has all zeros below the main diagonal.

2437
03:40:22,000 --> 03:40:25,000
We say that this matrix is upper triangular.

2438
03:40:25,000 --> 03:40:29,000
So all the interesting stuff is in the upper part of the matrix.

2439
03:40:29,000 --> 03:40:37,000
This next one, the middle one, is lower triangular because all the interesting stuff is in the lower part of the matrix.

2440
03:40:37,000 --> 03:40:39,000
Everything above the diagonal is zeros.

2441
03:40:39,000 --> 03:40:41,000
And then here's another one.

2442
03:40:41,000 --> 03:40:45,000
This one is upper triangular also.

2443
03:40:45,000 --> 03:40:57,000
And I just want to make it clear that what defines a triangular matrix is that either above or below, or even both, the diagonal you have to have all zeros.

2444
03:40:57,000 --> 03:41:03,000
So this one is upper triangular because below the diagonal we have all zeros.

2445
03:41:03,000 --> 03:41:07,000
And it's okay to have some zeros above the diagonal or even on the diagonal.

2446
03:41:07,000 --> 03:41:11,000
But that has really nothing to do with whether this is a triangular matrix or not.

2447
03:41:11,000 --> 03:41:18,000
This is a triangular matrix because everything below the diagonal is zeros.

2448
03:41:18,000 --> 03:41:29,000
Alright, so we have a theorem that says if A is a triangular matrix, then the determinant of A is the product of the entries on the main diagonal of A.

2449
03:41:29,000 --> 03:41:36,000
So this is making it easy to compute the determinant if your matrix is triangular.

2450
03:41:36,000 --> 03:41:38,000
It's pretty easy to see how that works.

2451
03:41:38,000 --> 03:41:51,000
If we take a triangular matrix, then if we were going to compute the determinant directly, then I would expand about the first column.

2452
03:41:51,000 --> 03:41:56,000
So my determinant would be one, that's plus.

2453
03:41:56,000 --> 03:42:02,000
So one times the determinant of the matrix that you get if you eliminate the first row and first column.

2454
03:42:02,000 --> 03:42:05,000
So you got this three by three that we take here.

2455
03:42:05,000 --> 03:42:09,000
And notice that all the rest of the terms would be zero.

2456
03:42:09,000 --> 03:42:16,000
So it's one times this determinant plus this zero here times, or actually minus, this zero here times another determinant.

2457
03:42:16,000 --> 03:42:22,000
Plus this zero times another determinant minus this zero times another determinant.

2458
03:42:22,000 --> 03:42:26,000
So the only term that's non-zero is the one associated with the one.

2459
03:42:26,000 --> 03:42:29,000
So that's the only one I've written here.

2460
03:42:29,000 --> 03:42:35,000
And then if we take the determinant of this three by three, notice we do the same thing, expand about the first column.

2461
03:42:35,000 --> 03:42:39,000
So we've got one times five, because five is in the one, one position.

2462
03:42:39,000 --> 03:42:42,000
So that's a plus.

2463
03:42:42,000 --> 03:42:48,000
So one times five times this two by two sitting right here.

2464
03:42:48,000 --> 03:42:54,000
And notice again, all the other terms in that column are zero, so we don't need to worry about them.

2465
03:42:54,000 --> 03:42:58,000
And so we end up with one times five times this determinant.

2466
03:42:58,000 --> 03:43:01,000
And so it's going to be eight times one minus zero times nine.

2467
03:43:01,000 --> 03:43:03,000
So it's just eight times one.

2468
03:43:03,000 --> 03:43:11,000
So our determinants one times five times eight times one, which you see are the entries on the main diagonal.

2469
03:43:11,000 --> 03:43:15,000
So if your matrix is triangular, life is good.

2470
03:43:15,000 --> 03:43:16,000
Life is easy.

2471
03:43:16,000 --> 03:43:21,000
Just multiply the entries on the diagonal.

2472
03:43:21,000 --> 03:43:28,000
Just thinking ahead just a little bit, notice that a triangular matrix is an echelon form.

2473
03:43:28,000 --> 03:43:32,000
Or if it's upper triangular, it's an echelon form.

2474
03:43:32,000 --> 03:43:37,000
If it was lower triangular, we could swap rows.

2475
03:43:37,000 --> 03:43:39,000
And we'd have to swap some columns too.

2476
03:43:39,000 --> 03:43:45,000
But let's just think about upper triangular at this point.

2477
03:43:45,000 --> 03:43:48,000
Now, so something to think about.

2478
03:43:48,000 --> 03:43:55,000
To compute the determinant of a large matrix, let's just say large is four by four or bigger.

2479
03:43:55,000 --> 03:44:04,000
Could we first put an echelon form and then just take the determinant by multiplying the diagonal entries?

2480
03:44:04,000 --> 03:44:06,000
Would that work?

2481
03:44:06,000 --> 03:44:14,000
Well, to answer that, we need to explore how elementary row operations affect the determinant of a matrix.

2482
03:44:14,000 --> 03:44:22,000
So if we can nail that down, then it is indeed possible that we could just put our matrix in echelon form

2483
03:44:22,000 --> 03:44:26,000
and then easily compute the determinant that way.

2484
03:44:26,000 --> 03:44:35,000
So that's what we'll ponder and we'll discuss that in the next section.

2485
03:44:35,000 --> 03:44:40,000
Okay, last time we talked about how to compute the determinant of a matrix.

2486
03:44:40,000 --> 03:44:51,000
And we discovered that as the matrix got larger, the amount of work required to compute the determinant increased dramatically.

2487
03:44:51,000 --> 03:45:00,000
Even a four by four without any zeros in it, as a considerable amount of works, take the determinant up.

2488
03:45:00,000 --> 03:45:11,000
So we also saw that if a matrix is triangular, then computing the determinant is easy.

2489
03:45:11,000 --> 03:45:15,000
You just multiply the diagonal elements.

2490
03:45:15,000 --> 03:45:36,000
And so we thought, hmm, I wonder if we could just do some row operations and either just generate some zeros or get the matrix totally in echelon form,

2491
03:45:36,000 --> 03:45:47,000
which would be upper triangular form, and then compute the determinant just so we can eliminate some of the work required.

2492
03:45:47,000 --> 03:45:52,000
So we're going to first talk today about how row operations affect the determinant.

2493
03:45:52,000 --> 03:46:05,000
Because if you do row operations, you need to know what effect that has on the determinant if you're going to try to go down that road in order to compute the determinant.

2494
03:46:05,000 --> 03:46:11,000
Okay, so first thing we'll look at is the effect of swapping rows.

2495
03:46:11,000 --> 03:46:16,000
So the example I have here, I just swapped the rows.

2496
03:46:16,000 --> 03:46:21,000
So the first matrix I call A, swap the rows, call that matrix B.

2497
03:46:21,000 --> 03:46:27,000
And obviously we know the determinant of A is just AD minus BC.

2498
03:46:27,000 --> 03:46:37,000
The determinant of B is BC minus AD, which is the negative of AD minus BC.

2499
03:46:37,000 --> 03:46:43,000
So we have the determinant of A equals minus the determinant of B.

2500
03:46:43,000 --> 03:46:50,000
And this holds true no matter what size your matrix is.

2501
03:46:50,000 --> 03:47:01,000
So we have a theorem that says if you have a matrix A and you exchange two rows or swap two rows of A to produce B,

2502
03:47:01,000 --> 03:47:06,000
then the determinant of B is just the negative of the determinant of A.

2503
03:47:06,000 --> 03:47:14,000
So if you swapped rows again, you negate the determinant again.

2504
03:47:14,000 --> 03:47:17,000
Suppose we have this example in a three by three.

2505
03:47:17,000 --> 03:47:21,000
Let's just suppose the determinant of this matrix is T.

2506
03:47:21,000 --> 03:47:29,000
Then we swap the first two rows and the determinant of this matrix, we've negated the determinant of the original one.

2507
03:47:29,000 --> 03:47:33,000
So the determinant of this one is negative T.

2508
03:47:33,000 --> 03:47:40,000
Then if we swap two rows again, so to get to this matrix here,

2509
03:47:40,000 --> 03:47:48,000
we have interchanged the second and third rows of the previous matrix.

2510
03:47:48,000 --> 03:47:51,000
And so I've negated the determinant again.

2511
03:47:51,000 --> 03:47:57,000
So the determinant will be negative of the determinant here, which is negative T.

2512
03:47:57,000 --> 03:47:59,000
And notice we're back to where we started.

2513
03:47:59,000 --> 03:48:04,000
So as you interchange rows, that just negates the determinant.

2514
03:48:05,000 --> 03:48:11,000
If you do two of them, then you're back to where you started.

2515
03:48:11,000 --> 03:48:14,000
Alright, another row operation.

2516
03:48:14,000 --> 03:48:20,000
Here we're multiplying a constant by one row and adding to another.

2517
03:48:20,000 --> 03:48:24,000
So again, the determinant of A is just AD minus BC.

2518
03:48:24,000 --> 03:48:36,000
The determinant of B is A times KB plus D minus B times KA plus C.

2519
03:48:36,000 --> 03:48:38,000
And we can do a little algebra.

2520
03:48:38,000 --> 03:48:42,000
Notice that the KAB terms, there's two of them and they cancel each other out.

2521
03:48:42,000 --> 03:48:45,000
So you're just left with AD minus BC.

2522
03:48:45,000 --> 03:48:51,000
So with this row operation, you don't change the determinant at all, which is kind of nice.

2523
03:48:51,000 --> 03:48:55,000
Because we know that when we're doing row operations on a matrix,

2524
03:48:55,000 --> 03:48:58,000
this is the one we're doing 99% of the time.

2525
03:48:58,000 --> 03:49:04,000
And so it has absolutely no effect on the determinant.

2526
03:49:04,000 --> 03:49:06,000
Okay, so another theorem.

2527
03:49:06,000 --> 03:49:13,000
If a multiple of one row of A is added to another row to produce a matrix B,

2528
03:49:13,000 --> 03:49:18,000
then the determinant of B is equal to the determinant of A.

2529
03:49:18,000 --> 03:49:21,000
Okay, the third row operation is multiplying a row by a constant.

2530
03:49:21,000 --> 03:49:25,000
So here I've multiplied row two by K.

2531
03:49:25,000 --> 03:49:33,000
So again, determinant of A, AD minus BC, determinant of B is A times KD minus B times KC.

2532
03:49:33,000 --> 03:49:38,000
In fact, we're out of K and we end up with K times AD minus BC.

2533
03:49:38,000 --> 03:49:45,000
So we see that the determinant of B is K times the determinant of A.

2534
03:49:45,000 --> 03:49:52,000
Or when you're going backwards, you know, if you were using the determinant of B

2535
03:49:52,000 --> 03:49:56,000
to try to go back to get the determinant of A,

2536
03:49:56,000 --> 03:50:01,000
the determinant of A would be one over K times the determinant of B.

2537
03:50:01,000 --> 03:50:03,000
So another theorem.

2538
03:50:03,000 --> 03:50:06,000
If a row of A is multiplied by K to produce a matrix B,

2539
03:50:06,000 --> 03:50:10,000
then the determinant of B is equal to K times the determinant of A.

2540
03:50:10,000 --> 03:50:16,000
That holds true for any square matrix A.

2541
03:50:16,000 --> 03:50:20,000
Kind of tagging along with this, I said,

2542
03:50:20,000 --> 03:50:26,000
what happens if we multiply the whole matrix by a constant?

2543
03:50:26,000 --> 03:50:30,000
So start off with our ABCD, multiply one row.

2544
03:50:30,000 --> 03:50:32,000
This is the matrix we had before.

2545
03:50:32,000 --> 03:50:37,000
Multiply it by row two by K to get this matrix.

2546
03:50:37,000 --> 03:50:43,000
Multiply the row one by K to get this one, which is just equal to K times the whole matrix.

2547
03:50:43,000 --> 03:50:50,000
So we know the determinant of A is AD minus BC.

2548
03:50:50,000 --> 03:50:54,000
The determinant of KA, take the determinant of this matrix.

2549
03:50:54,000 --> 03:50:58,000
We end up with K squared times AD minus BC,

2550
03:50:58,000 --> 03:51:03,000
which makes sense because we know what the determinant of this one is.

2551
03:51:03,000 --> 03:51:07,000
It was the one we looked at previously, and it was just K times the determinant of A.

2552
03:51:07,000 --> 03:51:13,000
So we just did one more row operation, multiplying another row by K.

2553
03:51:13,000 --> 03:51:20,000
And so we should incur that K term one more time, and hence we get the K squared.

2554
03:51:20,000 --> 03:51:24,000
So the determinant of K times the matrix.

2555
03:51:24,000 --> 03:51:28,000
Now this is just in general not a row operation here,

2556
03:51:28,000 --> 03:51:32,000
but if you just multiply K times the whole matrix,

2557
03:51:32,000 --> 03:51:35,000
you get K squared times the determinant of A.

2558
03:51:35,000 --> 03:51:38,000
That's for this case with a two by two.

2559
03:51:38,000 --> 03:51:45,000
Notice that if A had been three by three, we would have had to multiply each of three rows by K,

2560
03:51:45,000 --> 03:51:50,000
and we would incur that K term three times, not two, is in this case.

2561
03:51:50,000 --> 03:51:55,000
So in general, if A is N by N, and K is a scalar,

2562
03:51:55,000 --> 03:52:01,000
then the determinant of K times A is K to the N times the determinant of A.

2563
03:52:01,000 --> 03:52:04,000
So if A is three by three, you're going to get K cubed.

2564
03:52:04,000 --> 03:52:09,000
That's four by four. You're going to get a K to the fourth term.

2565
03:52:09,000 --> 03:52:16,000
Okay, so here's an example of how you can use these ideas that we've talked about to compute the determinant.

2566
03:52:16,000 --> 03:52:21,000
Now if we were just doing this one straight away using cofactor expansion,

2567
03:52:21,000 --> 03:52:26,000
we would clearly expand about the fourth column here.

2568
03:52:26,000 --> 03:52:31,000
But notice that it's simple to do one row operation here

2569
03:52:31,000 --> 03:52:37,000
and generate another zero in this column, which will eliminate a significant amount of work.

2570
03:52:37,000 --> 03:52:41,000
You know, as it is, we would need to do two three by three determinants.

2571
03:52:41,000 --> 03:52:46,000
But if we do one row operation to generate a zero here where the six is,

2572
03:52:46,000 --> 03:52:54,000
then we cut our work in half, because then we only need to evaluate one three by three determinant.

2573
03:52:54,000 --> 03:53:01,000
So let's do two times row four, or negative two times row four plus row three.

2574
03:53:01,000 --> 03:53:08,000
And notice that that kind of row operation we call does not change the determinant.

2575
03:53:08,000 --> 03:53:15,000
Okay, so if we do that, we can do this row operation.

2576
03:53:15,000 --> 03:53:20,000
We get this matrix, notice a zero here where the six was.

2577
03:53:20,000 --> 03:53:25,000
And then we just expand about the last column.

2578
03:53:25,000 --> 03:53:31,000
So we need this three, we need to figure out what sign goes with three.

2579
03:53:31,000 --> 03:53:38,000
So start here, one one position is a plus, minus, plus, minus, plus, minus, plus.

2580
03:53:38,000 --> 03:53:45,000
So it's plus three times the determinant of this three by three matrix sitting right here.

2581
03:53:45,000 --> 03:53:47,000
Okay, so that's what I have here.

2582
03:53:47,000 --> 03:54:00,000
And then I've expanded about the third row, which now I'm seeing that this is not looking right,

2583
03:54:00,000 --> 03:54:03,000
because this should be negative three here.

2584
03:54:03,000 --> 03:54:07,000
Oh, no, no, no, negative three here, my mistake.

2585
03:54:07,000 --> 03:54:10,000
This three here comes from the ones outside.

2586
03:54:10,000 --> 03:54:15,000
And then when I expand about the third row, the negative three is right here.

2587
03:54:15,000 --> 03:54:22,000
All right, so in the negative three is in a plus position, because we start with a one one, that's plus, minus, plus.

2588
03:54:22,000 --> 03:54:27,000
So we have plus negative three, okay, times this two by two.

2589
03:54:27,000 --> 03:54:30,000
And then we got a zero, so we can skip that.

2590
03:54:30,000 --> 03:54:33,000
So it would be minus zero, then plus negative two.

2591
03:54:33,000 --> 03:54:35,000
So here's the other term.

2592
03:54:35,000 --> 03:54:41,000
And if we continue to work it out, we end up with a hundred and fourteen.

2593
03:54:41,000 --> 03:54:44,000
Okay, so that was pretty straightforward.

2594
03:54:44,000 --> 03:54:51,000
I want to show you one more just that has a little more work involved.

2595
03:54:51,000 --> 03:54:58,000
And for that, I'm going to go to maple just because that kind of makes it a little bit easier.

2596
03:54:58,000 --> 03:55:03,000
So I've got it set up.

2597
03:55:03,000 --> 03:55:07,000
Here's the matrix that we're going to start with.

2598
03:55:08,000 --> 03:55:19,000
And notice this, I guess I could do a row operation to generate a zero in the third column here.

2599
03:55:19,000 --> 03:55:21,000
That would probably make life easier.

2600
03:55:21,000 --> 03:55:25,000
That would be the way to go if you were actually doing this by hand.

2601
03:55:25,000 --> 03:55:33,000
But I would have wanted to illustrate the concept of how you could use these row operations.

2602
03:55:33,000 --> 03:55:38,000
So I have actually done the row operations to get it in triangular form.

2603
03:55:38,000 --> 03:55:47,000
And then I want to show you how to go back and recreate the determinant of the original matrix based on the row operations that we've done.

2604
03:55:47,000 --> 03:55:58,000
Okay, so the first thing I did was I just started out to generate zeros in the first column.

2605
03:55:58,000 --> 03:56:06,000
So I used the negative three here to generate a zero here and here.

2606
03:56:06,000 --> 03:56:14,000
So the first operation I did was to this command here add row.

2607
03:56:14,000 --> 03:56:19,000
What it does is take row A, so we're matrix A.

2608
03:56:19,000 --> 03:56:22,000
So we're operating on the original matrix A.

2609
03:56:22,000 --> 03:56:31,000
And we're going to change row three by multiplying row one by negative one.

2610
03:56:31,000 --> 03:56:37,000
So this operation is negative one times row one plus row three.

2611
03:56:37,000 --> 03:56:40,000
And we generated zero in row three.

2612
03:56:40,000 --> 03:56:46,000
Then I do row one plus row four.

2613
03:56:46,000 --> 03:56:48,000
So that's the next command.

2614
03:56:48,000 --> 03:56:52,000
Now I'm operating on A1, this matrix here.

2615
03:56:52,000 --> 03:56:57,000
And I'm going to change row four by multiplying row one by one.

2616
03:56:57,000 --> 03:57:04,000
So the negative three plus three gives me zero here.

2617
03:57:04,000 --> 03:57:09,000
Then I'm going to swap rows.

2618
03:57:09,000 --> 03:57:21,000
I'm going to swap the first and the second row because then that gives me a one in the one one position.

2619
03:57:21,000 --> 03:57:23,000
So I'm just swapping rows.

2620
03:57:23,000 --> 03:57:26,000
Now notice at this point we've negated the determinant.

2621
03:57:26,000 --> 03:57:33,000
So whatever if I took the determinant of A3, it would be the negative of the determinant of the original matrix.

2622
03:57:33,000 --> 03:57:37,000
So keep in mind that we've done one row swap.

2623
03:57:37,000 --> 03:57:42,000
Now I'm going to generate a zero here where the negative three is.

2624
03:57:42,000 --> 03:57:48,000
And so to do that I'm operating on A3, matrix A3.

2625
03:57:48,000 --> 03:57:54,000
I'm going to change row two by multiplying row one by three.

2626
03:57:54,000 --> 03:58:04,000
So three times row one minus three gives me zero there in that first position.

2627
03:58:04,000 --> 03:58:08,000
Okay now I'm ready to move over to the next column.

2628
03:58:08,000 --> 03:58:15,000
And so the first thing I'm going to do here since there's no nice numbers here to work with,

2629
03:58:15,000 --> 03:58:19,000
I'm going to just multiply row two by one seventh.

2630
03:58:19,000 --> 03:58:23,000
So the command to do that is this one, multiply row.

2631
03:58:23,000 --> 03:58:27,000
So I'm going to multiply row working on A4.

2632
03:58:27,000 --> 03:58:31,000
I'm going to multiply row two by one seventh.

2633
03:58:31,000 --> 03:58:36,000
So that gives me a one in the two-two position.

2634
03:58:36,000 --> 03:58:40,000
And now I'm ready to zero out underneath that.

2635
03:58:40,000 --> 03:58:47,000
So my next operation is to work on A5.

2636
03:58:47,000 --> 03:58:55,000
And I'm going to multiply, I'm going to change row three by multiplying row two by negative six.

2637
03:58:55,000 --> 03:59:01,000
Alright so negative six times one plus this six gives me the zero here.

2638
03:59:01,000 --> 03:59:06,000
And then I need to do a similar thing to generate a zero in this position.

2639
03:59:06,000 --> 03:59:15,000
So I'm working on A6, multiply, or I'm going to change row four by multiplying row two by six.

2640
03:59:15,000 --> 03:59:24,000
So two times row two plus row four, I mean six times row two plus row four gives me a zero here.

2641
03:59:24,000 --> 03:59:31,000
So up to this point, the only thing that I've changed in terms of the determinant of the original matrix

2642
03:59:31,000 --> 03:59:33,000
is doing the one row swap.

2643
03:59:33,000 --> 03:59:35,000
So we've negated the determinant.

2644
03:59:35,000 --> 03:59:37,000
Oh we did the multiply row.

2645
03:59:37,000 --> 03:59:43,000
So we've changed the determinant by a factor of seven also.

2646
03:59:43,000 --> 03:59:46,000
Alright so keep those two things in mind.

2647
03:59:46,000 --> 03:59:50,000
And here the next thing I'm going to do is generate a one in this position.

2648
03:59:50,000 --> 03:59:58,000
So I'm going to do another multiply row, multiply row three by negative seven over twenty seven.

2649
03:59:58,000 --> 04:00:03,000
And that gives me the one in this position.

2650
04:00:03,000 --> 04:00:13,000
So now we've done a row swap and we've done two operations where we multiplied a row by a scalar.

2651
04:00:13,000 --> 04:00:16,000
So keep that in mind.

2652
04:00:16,000 --> 04:00:20,000
One more row operation to get a zero in this position.

2653
04:00:20,000 --> 04:00:29,000
So I'm going to multiply row three by negative thirteen sevenths and add that to row four.

2654
04:00:29,000 --> 04:00:31,000
So I get a zero there.

2655
04:00:31,000 --> 04:00:36,000
Now my matrix is in triangular form, upper triangular form.

2656
04:00:36,000 --> 04:00:46,000
So to take the determinant of this matrix it's just one times one times one times two.

2657
04:00:46,000 --> 04:00:54,000
And then to go back to get the matrix, the determinant of the original matrix,

2658
04:00:54,000 --> 04:00:57,000
I've got to back out these row operations.

2659
04:00:57,000 --> 04:01:00,000
So that's what I've done here.

2660
04:01:00,000 --> 04:01:07,000
So I've taken the determinant of A nine, which is, as I said, one times one times one times two.

2661
04:01:07,000 --> 04:01:10,000
So we could just do that.

2662
04:01:10,000 --> 04:01:20,000
Times seven and I'm multiplying times seven because of this row operation

2663
04:01:20,000 --> 04:01:26,000
because I've multiplied by one seventh to sort of back that out to get the original determinant.

2664
04:01:26,000 --> 04:01:32,000
So I've multiplied by seven and then I multiply by negative seven over twenty seven.

2665
04:01:32,000 --> 04:01:40,000
So I'm multiplying by the reciprocal of that and then multiplying by negative one because we did the row swap.

2666
04:01:40,000 --> 04:01:42,000
So put all that together.

2667
04:01:42,000 --> 04:01:48,000
I get the determinant of the original matrix is fifty four and then just to check,

2668
04:01:48,000 --> 04:01:55,000
I'll just use maple to determine that original determinant and we get fifty four again.

2669
04:01:55,000 --> 04:02:07,000
So this is a way you can back out the determinant of the original matrix by keeping track of the row operations that you did

2670
04:02:07,000 --> 04:02:12,000
and how they affect the determinant.

2671
04:02:12,000 --> 04:02:17,000
Okay, so back to this.

2672
04:02:17,000 --> 04:02:24,000
We're ready to look at a few theorems about determinants.

2673
04:02:24,000 --> 04:02:29,000
The first one here is actually another installment in the invertible matrix theorem.

2674
04:02:29,000 --> 04:02:35,000
Okay, so it says a square matrix A is invertible if and only if the determinant of A is not equal to zero.

2675
04:02:35,000 --> 04:02:46,000
So we've seen this, we saw this last time, but add that on to the invertible matrix theorem.

2676
04:02:46,000 --> 04:02:49,000
So this is an equivalent statement.

2677
04:02:49,000 --> 04:02:58,000
Determinant A equals not equal to zero is equivalent to A is invertible.

2678
04:02:58,000 --> 04:03:05,000
The determinant of A transpose is equal to the determinant of A.

2679
04:03:05,000 --> 04:03:15,000
If you think about that for a little bit, it actually is pretty easy to see why that is true.

2680
04:03:15,000 --> 04:03:22,000
Because if you think about taking the determinant of A, you choose some row or column to expand about.

2681
04:03:22,000 --> 04:03:26,000
For example, maybe expand about the first row.

2682
04:03:26,000 --> 04:03:34,000
Then if you're taking the determinant of A transpose, then you can do the exact same operations by expanding about the first column.

2683
04:03:34,000 --> 04:03:41,000
Since the first column of A transpose is equal to the first row of A, then you would be computing the determinant of A transpose

2684
04:03:41,000 --> 04:03:45,000
exactly how you would compute the determinant of the matrix A.

2685
04:03:45,000 --> 04:03:50,000
So you end up with getting the same value.

2686
04:03:50,000 --> 04:03:52,000
Okay, another theorem.

2687
04:03:52,000 --> 04:04:02,000
If A and B are square matrices, then the determinant of the product A times B is the determinant of A times the determinant of B.

2688
04:04:02,000 --> 04:04:07,000
The determinant of the product is the product of the determinants.

2689
04:04:07,000 --> 04:04:11,000
Notice, though, that that doesn't apply to sums.

2690
04:04:11,000 --> 04:04:18,000
So the determinant of A plus B is in general not equal to the determinant of A plus the determinant of B.

2691
04:04:18,000 --> 04:04:22,000
So don't make that mistake.

2692
04:04:22,000 --> 04:04:31,000
Okay, and that's all we have for this section.

2693
04:04:31,000 --> 04:04:34,000
Alright, let's talk about Kramer's Rule.

2694
04:04:34,000 --> 04:04:41,000
Kramer's Rule is actually one of the beautiful things in mathematics, I believe.

2695
04:04:41,000 --> 04:04:46,000
It's just a neat little idea.

2696
04:04:46,000 --> 04:04:53,000
And it's a way to solve a system of equations using only determinants.

2697
04:04:53,000 --> 04:04:56,000
So it's just very interesting.

2698
04:04:56,000 --> 04:04:58,000
So here's the way it works.

2699
04:04:58,000 --> 04:05:00,000
Kramer's Rule.

2700
04:05:00,000 --> 04:05:04,000
We have A is an n by n matrix.

2701
04:05:04,000 --> 04:05:20,000
Then for any B in Rn, the unique solution x of Ax equals B is given by this formula here, which looks rather odd.

2702
04:05:20,000 --> 04:05:26,000
Notice that we've got a way to compute x of i for each i.

2703
04:05:26,000 --> 04:05:31,000
And it's just a ratio of determinants.

2704
04:05:31,000 --> 04:05:34,000
In the denominator, we've got just the determinant of A.

2705
04:05:34,000 --> 04:05:39,000
In the numerator, it's the determinant of A sub i of B.

2706
04:05:39,000 --> 04:05:47,000
So A sub i of B refers to the matrix formed by replacing the i-th column of A with B.

2707
04:05:47,000 --> 04:05:50,000
Notice, we replace the i-th column of A with B.

2708
04:05:50,000 --> 04:05:58,000
So to get x1, we replace the first column of A with B and compute that determinant and divide by the determinant of A.

2709
04:05:58,000 --> 04:06:01,000
That's the value for x1 and so forth.

2710
04:06:01,000 --> 04:06:03,000
So a neat idea.

2711
04:06:03,000 --> 04:06:07,000
So let's just use it to solve this system.

2712
04:06:07,000 --> 04:06:10,000
So we need the determinant of A.

2713
04:06:10,000 --> 04:06:14,000
That's just 8 minus 5, just 3.

2714
04:06:14,000 --> 04:06:18,000
The determinant of A sub 1 of B.

2715
04:06:18,000 --> 04:06:22,000
Notice that I've just taken B, 6, 7,

2716
04:06:22,000 --> 04:06:24,000
plopped it into the first column of A.

2717
04:06:24,000 --> 04:06:27,000
Take the determinant, we get 5.

2718
04:06:27,000 --> 04:06:30,000
Same thing, A sub 2 of B.

2719
04:06:30,000 --> 04:06:34,000
We take B and plop it in the second column of A.

2720
04:06:34,000 --> 04:06:37,000
And take that determinant, we get negative 2.

2721
04:06:37,000 --> 04:06:43,000
And so x1 is just the 5 divided by 3.

2722
04:06:43,000 --> 04:06:47,000
And x2 is the negative 2 divided by 3.

2723
04:06:47,000 --> 04:06:51,000
And those are the values of x1 and x2.

2724
04:06:51,000 --> 04:06:56,000
Just to check, we take 5-thirds times the first column of A,

2725
04:06:56,000 --> 04:06:59,000
minus 2-thirds times the second column of A,

2726
04:06:59,000 --> 04:07:03,000
and we indeed get 6, 7.

2727
04:07:03,000 --> 04:07:06,000
Yippee!

2728
04:07:06,000 --> 04:07:10,000
It's nice when things work like they're supposed to.

2729
04:07:10,000 --> 04:07:13,000
I use the same method for 3 by 3 system.

2730
04:07:13,000 --> 04:07:18,000
This time, you've got to compute a determinant for each of 3 variables,

2731
04:07:18,000 --> 04:07:21,000
plus the determinant of A.

2732
04:07:21,000 --> 04:07:25,000
So here's a matrix A on the right-hand side, B.

2733
04:07:25,000 --> 04:07:29,000
Compute the determinant of A first,

2734
04:07:29,000 --> 04:07:34,000
and then we compute the determinant of A sub 1 of B.

2735
04:07:34,000 --> 04:07:37,000
So again, take B, take the vector B,

2736
04:07:37,000 --> 04:07:39,000
stick it in the first column of A,

2737
04:07:39,000 --> 04:07:43,000
leave the rest of A alone, and compute that determinant.

2738
04:07:43,000 --> 04:07:47,000
Same thing, A sub 2 of B, we take B,

2739
04:07:47,000 --> 04:07:50,000
stick it in the second column of A,

2740
04:07:50,000 --> 04:07:53,000
and leave the rest of A alone, compute that determinant.

2741
04:07:53,000 --> 04:07:58,000
A sub 3 of B, we take the B,

2742
04:07:58,000 --> 04:08:01,000
replace the third column of A,

2743
04:08:01,000 --> 04:08:04,000
compute that determinant, and then put it all together.

2744
04:08:04,000 --> 04:08:08,000
X1 is going to be negative 16 over 4.

2745
04:08:08,000 --> 04:08:11,000
X2 is going to be 52 over 4,

2746
04:08:11,000 --> 04:08:14,000
and X3 is going to be negative 4 over 4.

2747
04:08:14,000 --> 04:08:17,000
And so there's your solution to this system.

2748
04:08:17,000 --> 04:08:21,000
So just a really neat idea

2749
04:08:21,000 --> 04:08:24,000
in a neat way to solve systems of equations.

2750
04:08:24,000 --> 04:08:28,000
Clearly, we've run into the same problem for this 3 by 3.

2751
04:08:28,000 --> 04:08:32,000
It really wasn't that bad, but if it was a 4 by 4 system,

2752
04:08:32,000 --> 04:08:37,000
then you're computing 4 by 4 determinants.

2753
04:08:37,000 --> 04:08:40,000
Because you have to compute one for each variable,

2754
04:08:40,000 --> 04:08:42,000
one for each column.

2755
04:08:42,000 --> 04:08:46,000
So you have A1, A2, A3, and A4 of B.

2756
04:08:46,000 --> 04:08:49,000
Plus you need to compute the original determinant.

2757
04:08:49,000 --> 04:08:51,000
So you have 5, 4 by 4 determinants,

2758
04:08:51,000 --> 04:08:53,000
and that would be a lot of work.

2759
04:08:53,000 --> 04:08:56,000
So this is not practical in a general sense,

2760
04:08:56,000 --> 04:09:03,000
but for theoretical and for small matrices like this,

2761
04:09:03,000 --> 04:09:06,000
it's kind of a neat idea.

2762
04:09:06,000 --> 04:09:10,000
We can also apply it to a question like this.

2763
04:09:10,000 --> 04:09:13,000
Determine the values of the parameter s

2764
04:09:13,000 --> 04:09:17,000
for which the system given by this augmented matrix

2765
04:09:17,000 --> 04:09:19,000
has a unique solution.

2766
04:09:19,000 --> 04:09:22,000
And then describe the solution.

2767
04:09:22,000 --> 04:09:24,000
So we know it has a unique solution

2768
04:09:24,000 --> 04:09:28,000
when the determinant is not 0.

2769
04:09:28,000 --> 04:09:30,000
Because the determinant is not 0,

2770
04:09:30,000 --> 04:09:35,000
A is invertible, and there's a unique solution.

2771
04:09:35,000 --> 04:09:40,000
So if we take the determinant of the coefficient part of that matrix,

2772
04:09:40,000 --> 04:09:45,000
we end up with 15 times s squared plus 3.

2773
04:09:45,000 --> 04:09:50,000
And note that 15 times s squared plus 3

2774
04:09:50,000 --> 04:09:53,000
is not equal to 0 for all values of s.

2775
04:09:53,000 --> 04:09:59,000
You can never end up with that equal to 0

2776
04:09:59,000 --> 04:10:02,000
as long as s is a real number.

2777
04:10:02,000 --> 04:10:07,000
Because s squared plus 3 is always going to be positive.

2778
04:10:07,000 --> 04:10:11,000
And so this system is going to have a unique solution

2779
04:10:11,000 --> 04:10:14,000
no matter what the value of s is.

2780
04:10:14,000 --> 04:10:18,000
So we compute to get the,

2781
04:10:18,000 --> 04:10:21,000
to be able to describe the solution,

2782
04:10:21,000 --> 04:10:24,000
we can use Kramer's rule.

2783
04:10:24,000 --> 04:10:28,000
And so I've just computed A1 of B,

2784
04:10:28,000 --> 04:10:32,000
that takes B, the 3, 2, sticks it in the first column of A.

2785
04:10:32,000 --> 04:10:34,000
We compute that determinant.

2786
04:10:34,000 --> 04:10:37,000
Then same thing, A sub 2 of B,

2787
04:10:37,000 --> 04:10:40,000
we stick right hand side on the second column,

2788
04:10:40,000 --> 04:10:42,000
compute that determinant.

2789
04:10:42,000 --> 04:10:46,000
And then kind of massage things a little bit.

2790
04:10:46,000 --> 04:10:52,000
And we have expressions for the value of x1 and x2

2791
04:10:52,000 --> 04:10:56,000
for any value of s.

2792
04:10:56,000 --> 04:11:00,000
Okay, so it's just the 5 times 3s plus 2

2793
04:11:00,000 --> 04:11:03,000
divided by the determinant of A here.

2794
04:11:03,000 --> 04:11:06,000
And the 3 times 2s minus 9

2795
04:11:06,000 --> 04:11:11,000
divided by the determinant of A for x2.

2796
04:11:11,000 --> 04:11:15,000
We can also use Kramer's rule to compute A inverse.

2797
04:11:15,000 --> 04:11:18,000
Because as we saw in chapter 2,

2798
04:11:18,000 --> 04:11:20,000
to compute A inverse,

2799
04:11:20,000 --> 04:11:25,000
we simply need to solve some systems of equations.

2800
04:11:25,000 --> 04:11:29,000
So if we consider this matrix A,

2801
04:11:29,000 --> 04:11:33,000
we want to find B such that A times B equals the identity matrix.

2802
04:11:33,000 --> 04:11:37,000
So B here would be the inverse of A.

2803
04:11:37,000 --> 04:11:46,000
So let's let B1 and B2 denote the columns of B

2804
04:11:46,000 --> 04:11:51,000
and let E1 and E2 denote the columns of the identity matrix.

2805
04:11:51,000 --> 04:11:54,000
And we've used that notation before.

2806
04:11:54,000 --> 04:11:58,000
So we need to solve A times B1 equals E1

2807
04:11:58,000 --> 04:12:03,000
and A times B2 equals E2 here in this 2 by 2 case.

2808
04:12:03,000 --> 04:12:06,000
Alright, so if we take the determinant of A,

2809
04:12:06,000 --> 04:12:08,000
go back up and look at A here.

2810
04:12:08,000 --> 04:12:11,000
2 times 8, 16 minus 3 times 5.

2811
04:12:11,000 --> 04:12:13,000
So 16 minus 15.

2812
04:12:13,000 --> 04:12:16,000
The determinant of A is just 1.

2813
04:12:16,000 --> 04:12:18,000
Okay, now to get B1,

2814
04:12:18,000 --> 04:12:20,000
we're solving this system here.

2815
04:12:20,000 --> 04:12:22,000
A times B1 equals E1.

2816
04:12:22,000 --> 04:12:28,000
So to get the first entry in B1,

2817
04:12:28,000 --> 04:12:32,000
that's the determinant of A1 of E1.

2818
04:12:32,000 --> 04:12:37,000
Alright, we're solving, look at this augmented matrix.

2819
04:12:37,000 --> 04:12:41,000
So to get the first entry in the solution,

2820
04:12:41,000 --> 04:12:46,000
we replace the first column of A by the right-hand side,

2821
04:12:46,000 --> 04:12:48,000
which is E1.

2822
04:12:48,000 --> 04:12:50,000
Compute that determinant,

2823
04:12:50,000 --> 04:12:52,000
get 8, 8 over 1 is just 8.

2824
04:12:52,000 --> 04:13:00,000
So the 1, 1 entry in the inverse is 8.

2825
04:13:00,000 --> 04:13:08,000
Alright, now to get the second entry in the solution to this system here,

2826
04:13:08,000 --> 04:13:13,000
we substitute E1 into the second column of A.

2827
04:13:13,000 --> 04:13:16,000
Alright, so here we go with that.

2828
04:13:16,000 --> 04:13:19,000
And compute that determinant,

2829
04:13:19,000 --> 04:13:22,000
negative 5 divided by 1, we get negative 5.

2830
04:13:22,000 --> 04:13:26,000
So we've got the first column of the inverse, right?

2831
04:13:26,000 --> 04:13:28,000
Because we were solving this system,

2832
04:13:28,000 --> 04:13:30,000
A times B1 equals E1.

2833
04:13:30,000 --> 04:13:32,000
And so that's the first,

2834
04:13:32,000 --> 04:13:34,000
so we get the first column of the inverse,

2835
04:13:34,000 --> 04:13:38,000
B1 would be 8, negative 5.

2836
04:13:38,000 --> 04:13:42,000
To get B2, we solve a similar system.

2837
04:13:42,000 --> 04:13:46,000
Just now the right-hand side is 0, 1 instead of 1, 0.

2838
04:13:46,000 --> 04:13:51,000
And so to get the first entry in the solution to this system,

2839
04:13:51,000 --> 04:13:55,000
we substitute 0, 1 in the first column of A.

2840
04:13:55,000 --> 04:13:57,000
Alright, so you see that here.

2841
04:13:57,000 --> 04:13:59,000
Compute the determinant, get negative 3,

2842
04:13:59,000 --> 04:14:01,000
divided by 1, negative 3.

2843
04:14:01,000 --> 04:14:04,000
And then the second entry means substitute

2844
04:14:04,000 --> 04:14:07,000
the right-hand side in the second column of A.

2845
04:14:07,000 --> 04:14:09,000
Compute that determinant, get 2,

2846
04:14:09,000 --> 04:14:11,000
divided by the determinant of A.

2847
04:14:11,000 --> 04:14:13,000
And we have 2.

2848
04:14:13,000 --> 04:14:16,000
So we have A inverse, which is B,

2849
04:14:16,000 --> 04:14:22,000
given by this matrix that we just computed.

2850
04:14:22,000 --> 04:14:26,000
So in general, the ijth entry in the inverse

2851
04:14:26,000 --> 04:14:32,000
is given by the determinant of A sub i of Ej,

2852
04:14:32,000 --> 04:14:34,000
divided by the determinant of A.

2853
04:14:34,000 --> 04:14:37,000
So if you go back, for instance here,

2854
04:14:37,000 --> 04:14:41,000
to get the 1, 2 entry in the inverse,

2855
04:14:41,000 --> 04:14:47,000
we computed the determinant of A sub 1 of E2,

2856
04:14:47,000 --> 04:14:49,000
divided by the determinant of A.

2857
04:14:49,000 --> 04:14:52,000
To get the 2, 2 entry, it was A2 of E2,

2858
04:14:52,000 --> 04:14:54,000
divided by the determinant of A.

2859
04:14:54,000 --> 04:14:57,000
So in general, the ijth entry in the inverse

2860
04:14:57,000 --> 04:15:01,000
is the determinant of A sub i of Ej,

2861
04:15:01,000 --> 04:15:06,000
divided by the determinant of A.

2862
04:15:06,000 --> 04:15:11,000
We actually create a matrix,

2863
04:15:11,000 --> 04:15:13,000
which we call the adjugate,

2864
04:15:13,000 --> 04:15:15,000
or the adjoint of a matrix,

2865
04:15:15,000 --> 04:15:17,000
and stick in these values,

2866
04:15:17,000 --> 04:15:22,000
these determinants of A sub i E sub j.

2867
04:15:22,000 --> 04:15:24,000
We call that the,

2868
04:15:24,000 --> 04:15:27,000
the book uses the term adjugate primarily.

2869
04:15:27,000 --> 04:15:29,000
I typically use adjoint,

2870
04:15:29,000 --> 04:15:33,000
so those are synonymous terms.

2871
04:15:33,000 --> 04:15:37,000
But it's composed of all these determinants.

2872
04:15:37,000 --> 04:15:40,000
And so basically it's just these things,

2873
04:15:40,000 --> 04:15:43,000
but with the determinant of A term factored out.

2874
04:15:43,000 --> 04:15:46,000
So in general, A inverse is equal to

2875
04:15:46,000 --> 04:15:52,000
1 over the determinant of A times the adjoint of A.

2876
04:15:52,000 --> 04:15:58,000
So let's use that to find the inverse of this matrix here.

2877
04:15:58,000 --> 04:16:01,000
Okay, so first we'll find the adjoint,

2878
04:16:01,000 --> 04:16:03,000
or the adjugate of A.

2879
04:16:03,000 --> 04:16:07,000
And remember to get the,

2880
04:16:07,000 --> 04:16:11,000
to get the ijth entry in the adjoint,

2881
04:16:11,000 --> 04:16:14,000
it's the determinant of A sub i E sub j.

2882
04:16:14,000 --> 04:16:16,000
So for the 1, 1 entry,

2883
04:16:16,000 --> 04:16:19,000
it's the determinant of A1 E1.

2884
04:16:19,000 --> 04:16:20,000
So the 2, 1 entry,

2885
04:16:20,000 --> 04:16:23,000
determinant of A2 E1.

2886
04:16:23,000 --> 04:16:24,000
3, 1 entry,

2887
04:16:24,000 --> 04:16:27,000
determinant of A3 E1.

2888
04:16:27,000 --> 04:16:29,000
Alright, so I've computed all those.

2889
04:16:29,000 --> 04:16:31,000
A sub 1 of E1,

2890
04:16:31,000 --> 04:16:34,000
or E1 is the first column of the identity matrix.

2891
04:16:34,000 --> 04:16:38,000
The A1 says substitute that into the first column of A.

2892
04:16:38,000 --> 04:16:42,000
So there you have E1, 1, 0, 0,

2893
04:16:42,000 --> 04:16:44,000
substitute in the first column of A.

2894
04:16:44,000 --> 04:16:47,000
And take that determinant.

2895
04:16:47,000 --> 04:16:51,000
A sub 2 of E1 says put E1 into the second column of A.

2896
04:16:51,000 --> 04:16:53,000
So there we have it,

2897
04:16:53,000 --> 04:16:55,000
determinant there is 0.

2898
04:16:55,000 --> 04:16:59,000
A sub 3 of E1 says put E1 in the third column of A.

2899
04:16:59,000 --> 04:17:00,000
So there we go.

2900
04:17:00,000 --> 04:17:02,000
Take that determinant.

2901
04:17:02,000 --> 04:17:04,000
And do the same thing

2902
04:17:04,000 --> 04:17:07,000
for the other 6 entries in the adjoint.

2903
04:17:07,000 --> 04:17:08,000
1, 2 position,

2904
04:17:08,000 --> 04:17:11,000
determinant of A1 of E2.

2905
04:17:11,000 --> 04:17:14,000
So take E2, which is 0, 1, 0,

2906
04:17:14,000 --> 04:17:17,000
and substitute that in the first column of A.

2907
04:17:17,000 --> 04:17:18,000
So there.

2908
04:17:18,000 --> 04:17:19,000
So you can see,

2909
04:17:19,000 --> 04:17:21,000
here we have 0, 1, 0 in the first column,

2910
04:17:21,000 --> 04:17:23,000
here it's in the second column,

2911
04:17:23,000 --> 04:17:26,000
here it's in the third column.

2912
04:17:26,000 --> 04:17:29,000
And we compute each one of those determinants.

2913
04:17:29,000 --> 04:17:32,000
Then do it one more time for the third column.

2914
04:17:32,000 --> 04:17:35,000
Let's get the 1, 3, 2, 3, and 3, 3 elements.

2915
04:17:35,000 --> 04:17:38,000
So E3 is 0, 0, 1.

2916
04:17:38,000 --> 04:17:40,000
So we stick it in the first column of A,

2917
04:17:40,000 --> 04:17:42,000
then the second column of A,

2918
04:17:42,000 --> 04:17:43,000
third column of A,

2919
04:17:43,000 --> 04:17:45,000
and compute all those determinants.

2920
04:17:45,000 --> 04:17:48,000
Then we put it all together.

2921
04:17:48,000 --> 04:17:50,000
This is what we get.

2922
04:17:50,000 --> 04:17:53,000
And we need the determinant of A,

2923
04:17:53,000 --> 04:17:55,000
which we can compute.

2924
04:17:55,000 --> 04:17:56,000
That's 5.

2925
04:17:56,000 --> 04:17:59,000
So the inverse of A

2926
04:17:59,000 --> 04:18:01,000
is just 1 over the determinant of A.

2927
04:18:01,000 --> 04:18:04,000
So 1 5th times the adjoint of A,

2928
04:18:04,000 --> 04:18:06,000
which is this matrix.

2929
04:18:06,000 --> 04:18:07,000
And there's your inverse,

2930
04:18:07,000 --> 04:18:10,000
computed totally by doing elementary,

2931
04:18:10,000 --> 04:18:12,000
not elementary, row operations,

2932
04:18:12,000 --> 04:18:14,000
totally using determinants.

2933
04:18:21,000 --> 04:18:24,000
Okay, today we're going to start section 4.1

2934
04:18:24,000 --> 04:18:26,000
on vector spaces.

2935
04:18:26,000 --> 04:18:29,000
So we'll start with the definition

2936
04:18:29,000 --> 04:18:32,000
of a vector space.

2937
04:18:32,000 --> 04:18:35,000
You'll probably want to have your book out with you

2938
04:18:35,000 --> 04:18:37,000
because we're going to refer back

2939
04:18:37,000 --> 04:18:39,000
to this definition quite a bit.

2940
04:18:39,000 --> 04:18:45,000
So in your textbooks on page 217,

2941
04:18:45,000 --> 04:18:48,000
there's a lot to this definition,

2942
04:18:48,000 --> 04:18:50,000
so we'll spend a little time just talking about it

2943
04:18:50,000 --> 04:18:54,000
before we move on from there.

2944
04:18:54,000 --> 04:18:57,000
A vector space is said to be

2945
04:18:57,000 --> 04:19:02,000
a non-empty set V of objects

2946
04:19:02,000 --> 04:19:04,000
called vectors.

2947
04:19:04,000 --> 04:19:05,000
You know, let's stop there

2948
04:19:05,000 --> 04:19:07,000
because that's a little bit odd.

2949
04:19:07,000 --> 04:19:12,000
It's a set of objects called vectors.

2950
04:19:12,000 --> 04:19:14,000
I want to make the point here

2951
04:19:14,000 --> 04:19:19,000
that when the author uses the term vector

2952
04:19:19,000 --> 04:19:20,000
in this context,

2953
04:19:20,000 --> 04:19:23,000
he's not necessarily talking about a vector

2954
04:19:23,000 --> 04:19:25,000
of the type we're familiar with,

2955
04:19:25,000 --> 04:19:28,000
like in R2 or R3 or so forth.

2956
04:19:28,000 --> 04:19:31,000
He's using it in a more generic sense,

2957
04:19:31,000 --> 04:19:34,000
and I actually like to use the term object

2958
04:19:34,000 --> 04:19:38,000
just to keep from confusing you

2959
04:19:38,000 --> 04:19:41,000
between exactly what he's referring to

2960
04:19:41,000 --> 04:19:43,000
by using the word vector.

2961
04:19:43,000 --> 04:19:45,000
And as we go along today,

2962
04:19:45,000 --> 04:19:48,000
you'll kind of see what I'm talking about here.

2963
04:19:48,000 --> 04:19:50,000
Okay, so starting over.

2964
04:19:50,000 --> 04:19:55,000
A vector space is a non-empty set V of objects

2965
04:19:55,000 --> 04:19:59,000
on which are defined two operations

2966
04:19:59,000 --> 04:20:03,000
called addition and multiplication by scalars,

2967
04:20:03,000 --> 04:20:05,000
which are real numbers.

2968
04:20:05,000 --> 04:20:08,000
Now again, this seems sort of odd,

2969
04:20:08,000 --> 04:20:10,000
I would think to you.

2970
04:20:10,000 --> 04:20:13,000
Because he's saying there's two operations,

2971
04:20:13,000 --> 04:20:15,000
and instead of saying two operations,

2972
04:20:15,000 --> 04:20:18,000
addition and multiplication by scalars,

2973
04:20:18,000 --> 04:20:20,000
he's saying there's two operations

2974
04:20:20,000 --> 04:20:24,000
called addition and multiplication by scalars,

2975
04:20:24,000 --> 04:20:27,000
which is kind of an odd way to phrase it.

2976
04:20:27,000 --> 04:20:30,000
And the reason why he says it like that

2977
04:20:30,000 --> 04:20:34,000
is because since these objects

2978
04:20:34,000 --> 04:20:36,000
are not necessarily vectors

2979
04:20:36,000 --> 04:20:39,000
in the traditional sense that we're used to,

2980
04:20:39,000 --> 04:20:43,000
then addition and multiplication by scalars

2981
04:20:43,000 --> 04:20:47,000
are not necessarily defined as we're accustomed to.

2982
04:20:47,000 --> 04:20:52,000
They can in fact be defined in any way that you would like,

2983
04:20:52,000 --> 04:20:56,000
as long as these properties here are satisfied.

2984
04:20:56,000 --> 04:21:01,000
So we're in an abstract sense here.

2985
04:21:01,000 --> 04:21:04,000
We're talking about objects and operations.

2986
04:21:05,000 --> 04:21:11,000
And so don't assume that we're talking about

2987
04:21:11,000 --> 04:21:14,000
vectors in the traditional sense,

2988
04:21:14,000 --> 04:21:17,000
nor addition and scalar multiplication

2989
04:21:17,000 --> 04:21:20,000
in the traditional sense.

2990
04:21:20,000 --> 04:21:24,000
Okay, so we have this collection of objects

2991
04:21:24,000 --> 04:21:26,000
in these two operations,

2992
04:21:26,000 --> 04:21:30,000
and they are subject to the ten axioms given here.

2993
04:21:30,000 --> 04:21:33,000
And these axioms must hold for all vectors,

2994
04:21:33,000 --> 04:21:36,000
u, v, and w, in the set v,

2995
04:21:36,000 --> 04:21:39,000
and for all scalars, c, and d.

2996
04:21:39,000 --> 04:21:41,000
Okay, so I've kind of highlighted some

2997
04:21:41,000 --> 04:21:46,000
because some are a little bit more interesting than others.

2998
04:21:46,000 --> 04:21:49,000
Number one says the sum of u and v,

2999
04:21:49,000 --> 04:21:53,000
denoted by u plus v, is in the set v.

3000
04:21:53,000 --> 04:21:56,000
So it just says if you take any two vectors from the set

3001
04:21:56,000 --> 04:21:59,000
and you add them together,

3002
04:21:59,000 --> 04:22:03,000
then you get another vector that is still in the set.

3003
04:22:03,000 --> 04:22:05,000
And as we'll see in a minute,

3004
04:22:05,000 --> 04:22:08,000
this property is called closure,

3005
04:22:08,000 --> 04:22:11,000
or we say that the set is closed under addition

3006
04:22:11,000 --> 04:22:15,000
if this property holds.

3007
04:22:15,000 --> 04:22:20,000
Okay, two and three are some standard properties.

3008
04:22:20,000 --> 04:22:24,000
Number two, we have a community property.

3009
04:22:24,000 --> 04:22:27,000
Three, associative.

3010
04:22:27,000 --> 04:22:31,000
Then number four says that in the set v,

3011
04:22:31,000 --> 04:22:33,000
there is a zero vector,

3012
04:22:33,000 --> 04:22:36,000
such that when you add it to any vector in the set,

3013
04:22:36,000 --> 04:22:38,000
you just get that vector back.

3014
04:22:38,000 --> 04:22:42,000
Okay, so u plus zero is equal to u.

3015
04:22:42,000 --> 04:22:50,000
Okay, so notice number one is referring to

3016
04:22:50,000 --> 04:22:52,000
an element that has to be in the set.

3017
04:22:52,000 --> 04:22:54,000
Okay, if u and v are in the set,

3018
04:22:54,000 --> 04:22:56,000
their sum has to be in the set.

3019
04:22:56,000 --> 04:22:59,000
Number four, also saying that there has to be

3020
04:22:59,000 --> 04:23:01,000
this zero vector in the set.

3021
04:23:01,000 --> 04:23:03,000
Okay, so we'll see it.

3022
04:23:03,000 --> 04:23:07,000
Number six kind of follows along with that, too.

3023
04:23:07,000 --> 04:23:12,000
Number five, the first says for each vector in the set,

3024
04:23:12,000 --> 04:23:16,000
you have another vector such that when you add it to the first,

3025
04:23:16,000 --> 04:23:18,000
you end up with a zero vector.

3026
04:23:18,000 --> 04:23:20,000
So it's essentially saying that every element

3027
04:23:20,000 --> 04:23:23,000
has an additive inverse in the set.

3028
04:23:23,000 --> 04:23:28,000
The number six says the scalar multiple of any vector

3029
04:23:28,000 --> 04:23:32,000
by constant c is denoted by c times u,

3030
04:23:32,000 --> 04:23:34,000
and that is in the set.

3031
04:23:34,000 --> 04:23:37,000
Okay, so this says that when you take the scalar multiple

3032
04:23:37,000 --> 04:23:40,000
of any vector in the set or any object in the set,

3033
04:23:40,000 --> 04:23:43,000
the result is also in the set.

3034
04:23:43,000 --> 04:23:46,000
So you can see that number one and four and number six

3035
04:23:46,000 --> 04:23:48,000
all are specifically referring to whether or not

3036
04:23:48,000 --> 04:23:51,000
particular elements are in the set.

3037
04:23:51,000 --> 04:23:55,000
And that will be important as we go along.

3038
04:23:55,000 --> 04:23:58,000
Number seven through ten are, again,

3039
04:23:58,000 --> 04:24:00,000
standard sorts of properties.

3040
04:24:00,000 --> 04:24:05,000
We have distributive properties,

3041
04:24:05,000 --> 04:24:10,000
and number ten, we have a multiplicative inverse property.

3042
04:24:10,000 --> 04:24:15,000
One times any element in the set is equal to that element.

3043
04:24:15,000 --> 04:24:18,000
And you might be looking especially at number ten

3044
04:24:18,000 --> 04:24:23,000
and going, well, when would that ever not be the case?

3045
04:24:23,000 --> 04:24:28,000
And the answer is going back to what I said originally

3046
04:24:28,000 --> 04:24:41,000
is that the set V can contain items other than just vectors

3047
04:24:41,000 --> 04:24:43,000
like from R2 or R3.

3048
04:24:43,000 --> 04:24:46,000
And these operations, addition and scalar multiplication,

3049
04:24:46,000 --> 04:24:50,000
can be defined in non-standard ways.

3050
04:24:50,000 --> 04:24:54,000
And so based on that, then sometimes it could be the case

3051
04:24:54,000 --> 04:24:58,000
that number ten would not be true.

3052
04:24:58,000 --> 04:25:02,000
Okay, so let's start with R2.

3053
04:25:02,000 --> 04:25:05,000
That's a simple set to think about.

3054
04:25:05,000 --> 04:25:10,000
And let's talk about whether R2 is a vector space.

3055
04:25:10,000 --> 04:25:15,000
The answer is yes, because all the properties except one and six

3056
04:25:15,000 --> 04:25:19,000
were in fact explicitly given in section 1.3.

3057
04:25:19,000 --> 04:25:22,000
So if you want to go back to page 32 and check that out,

3058
04:25:22,000 --> 04:25:27,000
all the properties except one and six are explicitly listed there.

3059
04:25:27,000 --> 04:25:29,000
So let's think about one and six.

3060
04:25:29,000 --> 04:25:34,000
Number one, we want to know if you take two vectors from R2

3061
04:25:34,000 --> 04:25:37,000
and add them together, do you get another vector in R2?

3062
04:25:37,000 --> 04:25:42,000
Well, here's two vectors in R2, A, B, and C, D.

3063
04:25:42,000 --> 04:25:45,000
When we add them together, we get A plus C, B plus D.

3064
04:25:45,000 --> 04:25:47,000
That's another vector in R2.

3065
04:25:47,000 --> 04:25:51,000
So the answer is yes there.

3066
04:25:51,000 --> 04:25:55,000
Number six, if you multiply a vector in R2 by a scalar,

3067
04:25:55,000 --> 04:25:57,000
do you get another vector in R2?

3068
04:25:57,000 --> 04:26:01,000
Is it closed under scalar multiplication?

3069
04:26:01,000 --> 04:26:06,000
And here we see multiply a vector times the scalar.

3070
04:26:06,000 --> 04:26:11,000
We get another vector in R2, both of whose components are real numbers.

3071
04:26:11,000 --> 04:26:16,000
And therefore R2 is a vector space.

3072
04:26:16,000 --> 04:26:21,000
And in fact, the set of real numbers,

3073
04:26:21,000 --> 04:26:26,000
a set of all vectors with two components, which is R2,

3074
04:26:26,000 --> 04:26:35,000
R3, and Rn in general are all vector spaces.

3075
04:26:36,000 --> 04:26:41,000
Going back to these property one and property six,

3076
04:26:41,000 --> 04:26:43,000
just to take a second look at those,

3077
04:26:43,000 --> 04:26:48,000
property one said that if you take any two vectors from the set

3078
04:26:48,000 --> 04:26:52,000
and compute their sum, then it is also in the set.

3079
04:26:52,000 --> 04:26:58,000
And if that is true, we say that the set is closed under addition.

3080
04:26:58,000 --> 04:27:02,000
Property six says if you take a scalar multiple of a vector in the set,

3081
04:27:02,000 --> 04:27:04,000
then the result is also in the set.

3082
04:27:04,000 --> 04:27:10,000
Then if this is true, we say that the set is closed under scalar multiplication.

3083
04:27:10,000 --> 04:27:15,000
Okay, so keep those terms in mind.

3084
04:27:15,000 --> 04:27:18,000
Let's move on and consider another set.

3085
04:27:18,000 --> 04:27:20,000
Here's another set.

3086
04:27:20,000 --> 04:27:22,000
This is a subset of R2.

3087
04:27:22,000 --> 04:27:26,000
So I'm saying we have a set S here,

3088
04:27:26,000 --> 04:27:32,000
which consists of vectors of the form X0, where X is a real number.

3089
04:27:32,000 --> 04:27:38,000
Okay, so basically everything in R2 where the second component is zero.

3090
04:27:38,000 --> 04:27:40,000
If you think about this graphically,

3091
04:27:40,000 --> 04:27:45,000
it's just saying that the Y component is zero.

3092
04:27:45,000 --> 04:27:52,000
So therefore, graphically speaking, S would just be the X axis.

3093
04:27:52,000 --> 04:27:59,000
So I want to know is S with the operations of addition

3094
04:27:59,000 --> 04:28:02,000
and scalar multiplication as traditionally defined.

3095
04:28:02,000 --> 04:28:07,000
Okay, what you're used to is S of vector space.

3096
04:28:07,000 --> 04:28:14,000
Well, again, axioms 2 and 3 and 7 through 10 follow automatically.

3097
04:28:14,000 --> 04:28:16,000
Since S is a subset of R2,

3098
04:28:16,000 --> 04:28:23,000
because 2, 3 and 7 through 10 are true of everything in R2.

3099
04:28:23,000 --> 04:28:25,000
And I'm assuming here that you get your book open

3100
04:28:25,000 --> 04:28:30,000
so you know which of these I'm referring to.

3101
04:28:30,000 --> 04:28:35,000
The other axioms depend on certain elements being in the set.

3102
04:28:35,000 --> 04:28:38,000
So we have to look at this closer.

3103
04:28:38,000 --> 04:28:41,000
So number one is S closed under addition,

3104
04:28:41,000 --> 04:28:44,000
i.e. if you take two elements in the set,

3105
04:28:44,000 --> 04:28:49,000
do you get another element in the set?

3106
04:28:49,000 --> 04:28:51,000
You take two elements in the set and add them together.

3107
04:28:51,000 --> 04:28:54,000
Do you get another element in the set?

3108
04:28:54,000 --> 04:28:58,000
Well, here I've taken a couple of generic elements from the set,

3109
04:28:58,000 --> 04:29:00,000
U and V.

3110
04:29:00,000 --> 04:29:03,000
And if we add them together, as I've done here,

3111
04:29:03,000 --> 04:29:06,000
notice that you get this vector of this form,

3112
04:29:06,000 --> 04:29:09,000
U1 plus V1 in the first component,

3113
04:29:09,000 --> 04:29:11,000
zero in the second component.

3114
04:29:11,000 --> 04:29:20,000
And this vector is in S instead of V.

3115
04:29:20,000 --> 04:29:24,000
Since U1 plus V1 is a real number,

3116
04:29:24,000 --> 04:29:26,000
let's pause here,

3117
04:29:26,000 --> 04:29:33,000
why do we know that U1 plus V1 is a real number?

3118
04:29:33,000 --> 04:29:38,000
The reason we know that is because U and V are both in S,

3119
04:29:38,000 --> 04:29:42,000
and therefore U1 has to be a real number,

3120
04:29:42,000 --> 04:29:44,000
V1 has to be a real number,

3121
04:29:44,000 --> 04:29:46,000
so we add two real numbers together,

3122
04:29:46,000 --> 04:29:48,000
we get another real number.

3123
04:29:48,000 --> 04:29:52,000
Okay, so we know the first component is a real number,

3124
04:29:52,000 --> 04:29:54,000
second component is zero,

3125
04:29:54,000 --> 04:29:56,000
and that's what it takes to be in the set S.

3126
04:29:56,000 --> 04:30:01,000
So S is closed under addition.

3127
04:30:01,000 --> 04:30:05,000
By number four, does S contain a zero element?

3128
04:30:05,000 --> 04:30:08,000
Does S contain a vector of zero such that

3129
04:30:08,000 --> 04:30:11,000
when you add zero to any vector in the set,

3130
04:30:11,000 --> 04:30:14,000
you just get that vector back?

3131
04:30:14,000 --> 04:30:19,000
Well, the obvious choice would be zero, zero.

3132
04:30:19,000 --> 04:30:22,000
So the question is, is that vector in S?

3133
04:30:22,000 --> 04:30:24,000
And the answer is yes,

3134
04:30:24,000 --> 04:30:26,000
because remember to be in S,

3135
04:30:26,000 --> 04:30:29,000
the first component has to be a real number,

3136
04:30:29,000 --> 04:30:30,000
which zero is,

3137
04:30:30,000 --> 04:30:32,000
and the second component has to be zero,

3138
04:30:32,000 --> 04:30:37,000
which we have here in the zero vector.

3139
04:30:37,000 --> 04:30:39,000
Okay, number five,

3140
04:30:39,000 --> 04:30:43,000
does each element have an additive inverse?

3141
04:30:43,000 --> 04:30:47,000
Well, if we start off with a generic element of the set,

3142
04:30:47,000 --> 04:30:51,000
say U equals U10,

3143
04:30:51,000 --> 04:30:56,000
we can add to that this vector negative U10,

3144
04:30:56,000 --> 04:30:58,000
and it is in the set.

3145
04:30:58,000 --> 04:31:00,000
How do we know that?

3146
04:31:00,000 --> 04:31:02,000
Well, if U1 is a real number,

3147
04:31:02,000 --> 04:31:04,000
then negative U1 has to be a real number,

3148
04:31:04,000 --> 04:31:06,000
and we have the second component is zero.

3149
04:31:06,000 --> 04:31:12,000
When we add those together, we get the zero vector.

3150
04:31:13,000 --> 04:31:16,000
It is S closed under scalar multiplication.

3151
04:31:16,000 --> 04:31:18,000
So if we multiply,

3152
04:31:18,000 --> 04:31:20,000
take a generic element from the set,

3153
04:31:20,000 --> 04:31:21,000
multiply it by a scalar,

3154
04:31:21,000 --> 04:31:24,000
do we get another element in the set?

3155
04:31:24,000 --> 04:31:27,000
Well, here's a generic element of the set,

3156
04:31:27,000 --> 04:31:29,000
U equals U10,

3157
04:31:29,000 --> 04:31:31,000
C is a scalar,

3158
04:31:31,000 --> 04:31:33,000
that just means it's just any real number,

3159
04:31:33,000 --> 04:31:36,000
and if we multiply C times U,

3160
04:31:36,000 --> 04:31:39,000
we end up with C U1 in the first component.

3161
04:31:39,000 --> 04:31:41,000
Now that has to be a real number,

3162
04:31:41,000 --> 04:31:44,000
which it is because C is real,

3163
04:31:44,000 --> 04:31:45,000
U1 is real.

3164
04:31:45,000 --> 04:31:47,000
We've got the product of two real numbers,

3165
04:31:47,000 --> 04:31:49,000
and that's another real number,

3166
04:31:49,000 --> 04:31:51,000
and the second component is zero.

3167
04:31:51,000 --> 04:31:54,000
That's what it takes again to be in S.

3168
04:31:54,000 --> 04:31:59,000
So S is indeed closed under scalar multiplication,

3169
04:31:59,000 --> 04:32:01,000
and at this point,

3170
04:32:01,000 --> 04:32:07,000
we've established that all 10 of the axioms are satisfied.

3171
04:32:07,000 --> 04:32:10,000
So S, our set S, is a vector space.

3172
04:32:13,000 --> 04:32:17,000
Okay, now it turns out that when you're dealing with subsets

3173
04:32:17,000 --> 04:32:19,000
of known vector spaces,

3174
04:32:19,000 --> 04:32:21,000
just like we were here,

3175
04:32:21,000 --> 04:32:23,000
S was a subset of R2,

3176
04:32:23,000 --> 04:32:26,000
then we really need to only examine

3177
04:32:26,000 --> 04:32:28,000
three of these properties

3178
04:32:28,000 --> 04:32:30,000
to see if the set's a vector space.

3179
04:32:30,000 --> 04:32:32,000
And actually,

3180
04:32:32,000 --> 04:32:35,000
we typically call it a subspace

3181
04:32:35,000 --> 04:32:38,000
of the larger vector space,

3182
04:32:38,000 --> 04:32:41,000
even though it is actually in itself a vector space.

3183
04:32:44,000 --> 04:32:47,000
Okay, so there's the three properties

3184
04:32:47,000 --> 04:32:49,000
are given here.

3185
04:32:49,000 --> 04:32:52,000
We say a subspace of a vector space V

3186
04:32:52,000 --> 04:32:56,000
is a subset H of V that has three properties.

3187
04:32:56,000 --> 04:33:00,000
The zero vector of V is an H.

3188
04:33:00,000 --> 04:33:03,000
H is closed under vector addition,

3189
04:33:03,000 --> 04:33:07,000
and H is closed under scalar multiplication.

3190
04:33:07,000 --> 04:33:09,000
Okay, so if we want to check to see

3191
04:33:09,000 --> 04:33:12,000
if a set is a subspace of a vector space,

3192
04:33:12,000 --> 04:33:15,000
we need to only check these three properties.

3193
04:33:17,000 --> 04:33:19,000
All right, so let's do that here.

3194
04:33:19,000 --> 04:33:21,000
There's another set, T.

3195
04:33:21,000 --> 04:33:23,000
And T is a subset of R2,

3196
04:33:23,000 --> 04:33:25,000
and it consists of all vectors

3197
04:33:25,000 --> 04:33:28,000
where the first entry is any real number,

3198
04:33:28,000 --> 04:33:31,000
and the second entry is a two.

3199
04:33:32,000 --> 04:33:37,000
So I want to know is T a subspace of R2?

3200
04:33:37,000 --> 04:33:39,000
So looking at the first one,

3201
04:33:39,000 --> 04:33:42,000
does T contain the zero vector of R2?

3202
04:33:42,000 --> 04:33:45,000
That was the first requirement to be a subspace.

3203
04:33:45,000 --> 04:33:47,000
So I'm asking, is zero zero

3204
04:33:47,000 --> 04:33:50,000
is the vector zero zero in T?

3205
04:33:50,000 --> 04:33:52,000
And if you look up here at T,

3206
04:33:52,000 --> 04:33:54,000
remember what does it take to be in T?

3207
04:33:54,000 --> 04:33:56,000
First components, any real number.

3208
04:33:56,000 --> 04:33:58,000
Second components, two.

3209
04:33:58,000 --> 04:34:01,000
If you look at zero zero, does that fit that bill?

3210
04:34:01,000 --> 04:34:03,000
No, it doesn't.

3211
04:34:03,000 --> 04:34:04,000
Why not?

3212
04:34:04,000 --> 04:34:07,000
Because the second component here is zero.

3213
04:34:07,000 --> 04:34:10,000
To be in T, the second component has to be a two.

3214
04:34:12,000 --> 04:34:15,000
So zero zero is not in T.

3215
04:34:15,000 --> 04:34:17,000
And at this point, we could stop and say,

3216
04:34:17,000 --> 04:34:20,000
no, T is not a subspace of R2

3217
04:34:20,000 --> 04:34:24,000
because it doesn't contain the zero vector of R2.

3218
04:34:24,000 --> 04:34:27,000
But for practice, let's just keep going.

3219
04:34:27,000 --> 04:34:31,000
And consider the other two conditions.

3220
04:34:31,000 --> 04:34:33,000
So here's T again.

3221
04:34:33,000 --> 04:34:35,000
Is it closed under addition?

3222
04:34:35,000 --> 04:34:38,000
So if I take two elements of T and add them together,

3223
04:34:38,000 --> 04:34:41,000
do I get another element of T?

3224
04:34:41,000 --> 04:34:45,000
Well, here's a couple of generic elements of T.

3225
04:34:45,000 --> 04:34:48,000
If I add them together, what happens?

3226
04:34:50,000 --> 04:34:53,000
Oops, look at that second element here.

3227
04:34:53,000 --> 04:34:56,000
Second element in the sum of these two is a four.

3228
04:34:56,000 --> 04:34:59,000
So this is not in T.

3229
04:34:59,000 --> 04:35:03,000
Because to be in T, your second component has to be a two.

3230
04:35:03,000 --> 04:35:05,000
Here it's a four.

3231
04:35:05,000 --> 04:35:10,000
So T is not closed under addition.

3232
04:35:10,000 --> 04:35:12,000
How about scalar multiplication?

3233
04:35:12,000 --> 04:35:16,000
Is it closed under scalar multiplication?

3234
04:35:16,000 --> 04:35:19,000
Well, let's take a generic element of T.

3235
04:35:19,000 --> 04:35:20,000
Here's one.

3236
04:35:20,000 --> 04:35:22,000
Got a real number on top.

3237
04:35:22,000 --> 04:35:24,000
Two in the second component.

3238
04:35:24,000 --> 04:35:26,000
We multiply by scalar.

3239
04:35:26,000 --> 04:35:28,000
And what do we get?

3240
04:35:28,000 --> 04:35:30,000
We get this vector.

3241
04:35:30,000 --> 04:35:33,000
Actually, we shouldn't get that vector.

3242
04:35:33,000 --> 04:35:35,000
That V1 should not be there.

3243
04:35:35,000 --> 04:35:37,000
Apologize for that.

3244
04:35:37,000 --> 04:35:39,000
Should be just C1 in the top.

3245
04:35:39,000 --> 04:35:42,000
Two C down in the bottom.

3246
04:35:42,000 --> 04:35:44,000
Make a note of that.

3247
04:35:46,000 --> 04:35:49,000
So again, this plus V1 shouldn't be here.

3248
04:35:49,000 --> 04:35:51,000
But let's look.

3249
04:35:51,000 --> 04:35:53,000
What's important really is the second component,

3250
04:35:53,000 --> 04:35:55,000
the two C here.

3251
04:35:55,000 --> 04:36:00,000
Because what we want to know is, is that zero?

3252
04:36:00,000 --> 04:36:05,000
And the answer is, well, it's zero only if C is zero.

3253
04:36:05,000 --> 04:36:07,000
And C is not restricted to be zero.

3254
04:36:07,000 --> 04:36:12,000
And therefore, we can easily come up with a counter example

3255
04:36:12,000 --> 04:36:16,000
to show that we can take a scalar multiple of an element of T

3256
04:36:16,000 --> 04:36:20,000
and end up with something outside of T.

3257
04:36:20,000 --> 04:36:23,000
So T is not closed under scalar multiplication.

3258
04:36:26,000 --> 04:36:27,000
All right.

3259
04:36:27,000 --> 04:36:29,000
Make one more note.

3260
04:36:29,000 --> 04:36:31,000
All right.

3261
04:36:31,000 --> 04:36:33,000
So in this case, this set T,

3262
04:36:33,000 --> 04:36:36,000
failed all three of the subspace tests.

3263
04:36:36,000 --> 04:36:40,000
Again, if you were simply trying to determine

3264
04:36:40,000 --> 04:36:43,000
if T is a subspace of R2,

3265
04:36:43,000 --> 04:36:46,000
you only need to find one that it fails.

3266
04:36:46,000 --> 04:36:47,000
And then you could stop there.

3267
04:36:47,000 --> 04:36:52,000
I just showed y'all three just for practice.

3268
04:36:52,000 --> 04:36:53,000
Okay.

3269
04:36:53,000 --> 04:36:59,000
So as I said before, these vector spaces such as R2

3270
04:36:59,000 --> 04:37:05,000
and R3 and Rn, those we are familiar with.

3271
04:37:05,000 --> 04:37:09,000
But there's a lot of other ones in which the elements

3272
04:37:09,000 --> 04:37:11,000
don't look like traditional vectors.

3273
04:37:11,000 --> 04:37:15,000
So let's kind of examine that a little bit.

3274
04:37:15,000 --> 04:37:20,000
Consider this set I'm calling M sub 2 by 2,

3275
04:37:20,000 --> 04:37:24,000
which is the set of all 2 by 2 matrices, okay,

3276
04:37:24,000 --> 04:37:28,000
where all the components are real numbers.

3277
04:37:28,000 --> 04:37:31,000
Turns out that M sub 2 by 2 is also a vector space,

3278
04:37:31,000 --> 04:37:33,000
even though its elements are matrices

3279
04:37:33,000 --> 04:37:37,000
instead of vectors in the traditional sense.

3280
04:37:37,000 --> 04:37:40,000
So let's go back through those properties

3281
04:37:40,000 --> 04:37:44,000
with M sub 2 by 2 in mind.

3282
04:37:44,000 --> 04:37:47,000
Okay, so let's start off and suppose

3283
04:37:47,000 --> 04:37:52,000
that A, B, and C are our 2 by 2 matrices

3284
04:37:52,000 --> 04:37:55,000
and that P and Q are scalars.

3285
04:37:55,000 --> 04:38:00,000
So property number one, if we add A and B together,

3286
04:38:00,000 --> 04:38:02,000
do we get another 2 by 2 matrix?

3287
04:38:02,000 --> 04:38:06,000
This is saying is M sub 2 by 2 closed under addition.

3288
04:38:06,000 --> 04:38:07,000
And clearly it is.

3289
04:38:07,000 --> 04:38:10,000
If you add two 2 by 2 matrices together,

3290
04:38:10,000 --> 04:38:15,000
you get another 2 by 2 matrix.

3291
04:38:15,000 --> 04:38:19,000
Alright, here are the second and third properties.

3292
04:38:19,000 --> 04:38:24,000
Those fall straight out from properties of matrices.

3293
04:38:24,000 --> 04:38:27,000
Number four, is there a zero matrix?

3294
04:38:27,000 --> 04:38:30,000
Alright, is there some 2 by 2 matrix

3295
04:38:30,000 --> 04:38:33,000
such that you can add to any other 2 by 2 matrix

3296
04:38:33,000 --> 04:38:35,000
and get that same matrix back?

3297
04:38:35,000 --> 04:38:37,000
Well, clearly there is.

3298
04:38:37,000 --> 04:38:43,000
So matrix with zeros in all the positions.

3299
04:38:43,000 --> 04:38:46,000
Number five, if you add negative A to A,

3300
04:38:46,000 --> 04:38:49,000
you get the zero matrix.

3301
04:38:49,000 --> 04:38:57,000
Number six, is M sub 2 by 2 closed under scalar multiplication.

3302
04:38:57,000 --> 04:38:59,000
So if you take any 2 by 2 matrix

3303
04:38:59,000 --> 04:39:01,000
and multiply it by scalar,

3304
04:39:01,000 --> 04:39:03,000
do you get another 2 by 2 matrix?

3305
04:39:03,000 --> 04:39:05,000
And of course you do.

3306
04:39:05,000 --> 04:39:09,000
So it's closed under scalar multiplication.

3307
04:39:09,000 --> 04:39:14,000
And then these final four properties fall straight out

3308
04:39:14,000 --> 04:39:17,000
from what we know about matrices.

3309
04:39:17,000 --> 04:39:22,000
So M sub 2 by 2 is indeed a vector space.

3310
04:39:22,000 --> 04:39:24,000
Another one about polynomials.

3311
04:39:24,000 --> 04:39:30,000
Polynomials are some standard examples of vector spaces.

3312
04:39:30,000 --> 04:39:33,000
Let's first start with piece of 2.

3313
04:39:33,000 --> 04:39:36,000
Piece of 2 is the set of all polynomials

3314
04:39:36,000 --> 04:39:39,000
of degree 2 or less.

3315
04:39:39,000 --> 04:39:43,000
So we wanted to write it in formal terms.

3316
04:39:43,000 --> 04:39:45,000
It would look like this.

3317
04:39:45,000 --> 04:39:49,000
A naught, set of all A naught plus A1 times t

3318
04:39:49,000 --> 04:39:51,000
plus A2 times t squared,

3319
04:39:51,000 --> 04:39:54,000
where A naught, A1, A2 are real numbers.

3320
04:39:54,000 --> 04:39:57,000
So here's some sample elements of piece of 2.

3321
04:39:57,000 --> 04:39:59,000
3 plus 2t.

3322
04:39:59,000 --> 04:40:02,000
Here 3 is A sub 0 is 3.

3323
04:40:02,000 --> 04:40:03,000
A1 is 2.

3324
04:40:03,000 --> 04:40:06,000
A2 in this case would be 0.

3325
04:40:06,000 --> 04:40:08,000
4t squared, that's in there.

3326
04:40:08,000 --> 04:40:12,000
8t squared minus 13t plus 45, that's in there.

3327
04:40:12,000 --> 04:40:17,000
Any polynomial of degree 2 or less.

3328
04:40:17,000 --> 04:40:22,000
And piece of 2 is indeed a vector space.

3329
04:40:22,000 --> 04:40:27,000
Let's look at these properties in terms of piece of 2.

3330
04:40:27,000 --> 04:40:31,000
So if we add two polynomials of degree 2 together,

3331
04:40:31,000 --> 04:40:34,000
do you get another polynomial of degree 2?

3332
04:40:34,000 --> 04:40:36,000
Okay, well, yes you do.

3333
04:40:36,000 --> 04:40:40,000
Here's how that works.

3334
04:40:40,000 --> 04:40:44,000
We've got two, let's call it p of t, which looks like this.

3335
04:40:44,000 --> 04:40:46,000
Q of t, which looks like this.

3336
04:40:46,000 --> 04:40:48,000
And if we add them together,

3337
04:40:48,000 --> 04:40:51,000
then we get this polynomial here,

3338
04:40:51,000 --> 04:40:56,000
which is again of degree 2 or less.

3339
04:40:57,000 --> 04:41:01,000
Okay, they satisfy the properties 2 and 3.

3340
04:41:01,000 --> 04:41:05,000
Let you explore that some more.

3341
04:41:05,000 --> 04:41:08,000
Number 4, do you have a zero element?

3342
04:41:08,000 --> 04:41:10,000
Is there a zero polynomial?

3343
04:41:10,000 --> 04:41:11,000
Well, yes there is.

3344
04:41:11,000 --> 04:41:12,000
It's just zero.

3345
04:41:12,000 --> 04:41:14,000
We add zero to any polynomial,

3346
04:41:14,000 --> 04:41:17,000
we get that same polynomial back.

3347
04:41:17,000 --> 04:41:22,000
If we negate all the coefficients in a polynomial

3348
04:41:22,000 --> 04:41:24,000
and add it to the original one,

3349
04:41:24,000 --> 04:41:28,000
we get the zero polynomial.

3350
04:41:28,000 --> 04:41:31,000
Number 6, is this set of polynomials

3351
04:41:31,000 --> 04:41:35,000
closed under scalar multiplication?

3352
04:41:35,000 --> 04:41:39,000
So if you multiply any polynomial of degree 2 or less by a scalar,

3353
04:41:39,000 --> 04:41:43,000
do you get another polynomial of degree 2 or less?

3354
04:41:43,000 --> 04:41:45,000
And the answer is yes.

3355
04:41:45,000 --> 04:41:48,000
Okay, here, multiply by a scalar

3356
04:41:48,000 --> 04:41:53,000
and we get another polynomial of degree 2 or less.

3357
04:41:53,000 --> 04:41:59,000
And again, 7 through 10 kind of fall out pretty straightforwardly.

3358
04:41:59,000 --> 04:42:02,000
Here's another set.

3359
04:42:02,000 --> 04:42:04,000
This is a subset, Q sub 2,

3360
04:42:04,000 --> 04:42:08,000
here's a subset of P sub 2.

3361
04:42:08,000 --> 04:42:12,000
Here, I've got all polynomials,

3362
04:42:12,000 --> 04:42:14,000
not of degree 2 or less,

3363
04:42:14,000 --> 04:42:18,000
but all polynomials of degree exactly 2.

3364
04:42:18,000 --> 04:42:21,000
So the way I've defined it is in this form,

3365
04:42:21,000 --> 04:42:23,000
looks like P sub 2, with this addition,

3366
04:42:23,000 --> 04:42:26,000
A sub 2 has to be non-zero.

3367
04:42:26,000 --> 04:42:30,000
So that makes it where you're going to have

3368
04:42:30,000 --> 04:42:32,000
a second degree polynomial.

3369
04:42:32,000 --> 04:42:35,000
You're going to have A sub 2, 9 equals 0,

3370
04:42:35,000 --> 04:42:40,000
so you're going to have the t squared term showing up.

3371
04:42:40,000 --> 04:42:46,000
So I want to know, is Q sub 2 a subspace of P sub 2?

3372
04:42:46,000 --> 04:42:49,000
So to show that it's a subspace,

3373
04:42:49,000 --> 04:42:53,000
we need to show that it satisfies those three properties, right?

3374
04:42:53,000 --> 04:42:56,000
It includes the zero element, closed under addition,

3375
04:42:56,000 --> 04:42:58,000
closed under scalar multiplication.

3376
04:42:58,000 --> 04:43:01,000
So is that the case?

3377
04:43:01,000 --> 04:43:03,000
Well, let's start with number one.

3378
04:43:03,000 --> 04:43:08,000
This Q sub 2 contains the zero element of P sub 2.

3379
04:43:08,000 --> 04:43:12,000
Well, zero element of P sub 2 is the zero polynomial, right?

3380
04:43:12,000 --> 04:43:14,000
Just zero.

3381
04:43:14,000 --> 04:43:17,000
So is that in Q sub 2?

3382
04:43:17,000 --> 04:43:19,000
And the answer is no, because,

3383
04:43:19,000 --> 04:43:22,000
go back up and look at the definition of Q sub 2,

3384
04:43:22,000 --> 04:43:26,000
A sub 2 can't be zero, right?

3385
04:43:26,000 --> 04:43:31,000
But down here, the zero polynomial, A sub 2 is zero.

3386
04:43:31,000 --> 04:43:37,000
So Q sub 2 does not contain the zero element of P sub 2.

3387
04:43:37,000 --> 04:43:39,000
So we could stop right here and say,

3388
04:43:39,000 --> 04:43:45,000
no, Q sub 2 is not a subspace of P sub 2.

3389
04:43:45,000 --> 04:43:49,000
But again, just for more experience,

3390
04:43:49,000 --> 04:43:55,000
we're going to go on and look at the other two.

3391
04:43:55,000 --> 04:43:59,000
So the second one is Q sub 2 closed under addition.

3392
04:43:59,000 --> 04:44:04,000
So if we add any two elements of Q sub 2 together,

3393
04:44:04,000 --> 04:44:06,000
do we get another element of Q sub 2?

3394
04:44:06,000 --> 04:44:12,000
Or if you add any two polynomials of degree exactly two,

3395
04:44:12,000 --> 04:44:17,000
or less, not or less, a degree exactly two,

3396
04:44:17,000 --> 04:44:22,000
do you get another polynomial of degree exactly two?

3397
04:44:22,000 --> 04:44:24,000
There it is there.

3398
04:44:24,000 --> 04:44:26,000
So here's an example.

3399
04:44:26,000 --> 04:44:31,000
But P of t be 6t squared minus 3t.

3400
04:44:31,000 --> 04:44:38,000
That is in Q sub 2 because we've got a 6,

3401
04:44:38,000 --> 04:44:41,000
okay, the A sub 2 term is not equal to zero.

3402
04:44:41,000 --> 04:44:48,000
And here's Q of t where the coefficient of t squared is not zero.

3403
04:44:48,000 --> 04:44:51,000
So we've got two polynomials here of degree exactly two.

3404
04:44:51,000 --> 04:44:58,000
When we add them together, what happens?

3405
04:44:58,000 --> 04:45:00,000
The t squared terms go away.

3406
04:45:00,000 --> 04:45:03,000
We're left with negative 3t plus 5.

3407
04:45:03,000 --> 04:45:06,000
And that is not a degree exactly two.

3408
04:45:06,000 --> 04:45:12,000
So Q sub 2 is not closed under addition.

3409
04:45:12,000 --> 04:45:15,000
About scalar multiplication.

3410
04:45:15,000 --> 04:45:21,000
If we multiply a polynomial of degree exactly two by a scalar,

3411
04:45:21,000 --> 04:45:25,000
do we always get another polynomial of degree exactly two?

3412
04:45:25,000 --> 04:45:27,000
So think about that.

3413
04:45:27,000 --> 04:45:33,000
So you start off with any sort of polynomial that's degree exactly two.

3414
04:45:33,000 --> 04:45:35,000
And you multiply it by any scalar.

3415
04:45:35,000 --> 04:45:39,000
Do you always get another polynomial of degree exactly two?

3416
04:45:39,000 --> 04:45:42,000
And if you don't think about that very long,

3417
04:45:42,000 --> 04:45:44,000
you might say, well, yeah, you multiply it by anything

3418
04:45:44,000 --> 04:45:47,000
and you're going to get another polynomial of degree exactly two.

3419
04:45:47,000 --> 04:45:50,000
And that's almost always true.

3420
04:45:50,000 --> 04:45:57,000
But there's one coefficient, one scalar you can use to multiply by zero.

3421
04:45:57,000 --> 04:46:06,000
Then you get the zero polynomial and it is not a degree exactly two.

3422
04:46:06,000 --> 04:46:12,000
So this means that Q2 is not closed under scalar multiplication.

3423
04:46:12,000 --> 04:46:21,000
So Q sub 2 here failed all three of the requirements to be a subspace of P sub 2.

3424
04:46:21,000 --> 04:46:25,000
Yeah, it only has to fail one and not to not be a subspace.

3425
04:46:25,000 --> 04:46:30,000
But this one, in fact, failed all three properties.

3426
04:46:30,000 --> 04:46:33,000
Okay, let's look at one more.

3427
04:46:33,000 --> 04:46:36,000
Let's look at z set of all integers.

3428
04:46:36,000 --> 04:46:42,000
Okay, and I want to know is z a subset of the real numbers, a subspace of the real numbers.

3429
04:46:42,000 --> 04:46:43,000
Excuse me.

3430
04:46:43,000 --> 04:46:46,000
Clearly it's a subset of the real numbers.

3431
04:46:46,000 --> 04:46:48,000
All right, so we want to know number one.

3432
04:46:48,000 --> 04:46:52,000
Does z contain the zero element of the real numbers?

3433
04:46:52,000 --> 04:46:59,000
Well, the zero element of the real numbers is just zero and zero is an integer.

3434
04:46:59,000 --> 04:47:04,000
So the answer here is yes.

3435
04:47:04,000 --> 04:47:07,000
Is z closed under addition?

3436
04:47:07,000 --> 04:47:12,000
If you take two integers and add them together, do you get another integer?

3437
04:47:12,000 --> 04:47:17,000
And the answer is yes, because the sum of any two integers is always an integer.

3438
04:47:17,000 --> 04:47:20,000
So we pass number one, we pass number two.

3439
04:47:20,000 --> 04:47:22,000
How about number three?

3440
04:47:22,000 --> 04:47:27,000
Is it closed under scalar multiplication?

3441
04:47:27,000 --> 04:47:34,000
So if we multiply an integer by a scalar, do we always get another integer?

3442
04:47:34,000 --> 04:47:39,000
Let's think about that.

3443
04:47:39,000 --> 04:47:42,000
Trick here is that the scalar could be a real number.

3444
04:47:42,000 --> 04:47:44,000
You don't have to multiply by an integer.

3445
04:47:44,000 --> 04:47:46,000
Scalar just means a real number.

3446
04:47:46,000 --> 04:47:49,000
That real number might not be an integer.

3447
04:47:49,000 --> 04:48:01,000
If we multiply our integer by a non-integer, then we open up the chance that we could end up with a non-integer.

3448
04:48:01,000 --> 04:48:03,000
So the answer is no.

3449
04:48:03,000 --> 04:48:05,000
It's not closed under scalar multiplication.

3450
04:48:05,000 --> 04:48:06,000
And here's an example.

3451
04:48:06,000 --> 04:48:13,000
If I multiply 0.5, there's my scalar, times three, my integer, I get 1.5.

3452
04:48:13,000 --> 04:48:16,000
1.5 is not an integer.

3453
04:48:16,000 --> 04:48:21,000
So here's a scalar, times my integer, I don't get another integer.

3454
04:48:21,000 --> 04:48:26,000
And so therefore Z is not closed under scalar multiplication.

3455
04:48:26,000 --> 04:48:38,000
And therefore it's not a subspace of the real numbers.

3456
04:48:38,000 --> 04:48:45,000
Okay, we're continuing in section 4.1 with more about vector spaces.

3457
04:48:45,000 --> 04:49:07,000
And there's one way that we've talked about for finding if a set is a subspace of another vector space is to show that it satisfies the three properties that it contains the zero vector of the parent vector space.

3458
04:49:07,000 --> 04:49:14,000
It's closed under addition and it's closed under scalar multiplication.

3459
04:49:15,000 --> 04:49:23,000
So to show that a set is a subspace, then you can show that these three things hold.

3460
04:49:23,000 --> 04:49:28,000
Or to show that it's not a subspace, show that at least one of these does not hold.

3461
04:49:28,000 --> 04:49:36,000
But we have another method for showing that a set is a subspace.

3462
04:49:36,000 --> 04:49:47,000
And this doesn't work in all cases, but in some cases you can use this theorem and it makes life much easier because you don't have to go through and show those three properties hold.

3463
04:49:47,000 --> 04:50:04,000
So the theorem says if v1 through vp are vectors in some vector space v, then the span of v1 through vp is a subspace of v.

3464
04:50:04,000 --> 04:50:26,000
So what this says is that if we can write our set as the span of a finite set of vectors, right in this form, span of v1 through vp for some vectors, then automatically we can conclude that the set is a subspace.

3465
04:50:27,000 --> 04:50:29,000
So let's look at this example.

3466
04:50:29,000 --> 04:50:33,000
We have a set S which consists of all vectors of this form.

3467
04:50:33,000 --> 04:50:37,000
It's a subset of R3.

3468
04:50:37,000 --> 04:50:41,000
First component is two times some real number t.

3469
04:50:41,000 --> 04:50:50,000
Second component is zero and the third component is the negative of that real number t that we had up in the first component.

3470
04:50:50,000 --> 04:50:56,000
Okay, so how we want to know if S is a subspace of R3.

3471
04:50:56,000 --> 04:51:08,000
If we use the original method, that is to show that the three properties hold, then we would start with saying does S contain the zero vector.

3472
04:51:08,000 --> 04:51:17,000
And in this case, if we set t equal to zero, then we get zero, zero, zero.

3473
04:51:17,000 --> 04:51:23,000
And so the zero vector is contained in the set S.

3474
04:51:23,000 --> 04:51:29,000
We go to the next property as S closed under addition.

3475
04:51:29,000 --> 04:51:43,000
We need two generic vectors from S, so let's call those u and v, and u looks like two u, zero, negative u, and we'll say v is two v, zero, negative v.

3476
04:51:43,000 --> 04:51:51,000
And we need to add those together and see if the resulting vector is in the form that has to be an S.

3477
04:51:51,000 --> 04:51:59,000
So we add u and v and rearrange terms just a little bit and we end up with this vector here.

3478
04:51:59,000 --> 04:52:08,000
We've got two times u plus v on the first component, zero on the second component, negative u plus v in the third component.

3479
04:52:08,000 --> 04:52:17,000
And this is in the form that it needs to be to be in the set S because u plus v here is a real number.

3480
04:52:17,000 --> 04:52:23,000
We know that because these came from the vectors u and v.

3481
04:52:23,000 --> 04:52:30,000
So we have two times u plus v in the first component, negative u plus v in the last component, zero in the middle.

3482
04:52:30,000 --> 04:52:35,000
So it is in S. So S is closed under addition.

3483
04:52:35,000 --> 04:52:41,000
So we move on to the third property is S closed under scalar multiplication.

3484
04:52:41,000 --> 04:52:51,000
Well, again, we need a generic vector from the set S in a scalar, which we'll call C, and we compute C times u.

3485
04:52:51,000 --> 04:53:03,000
And again, rearranging terms a little bit, we can write it as two times cu in the first component, negative c times u in the last component, zero in the middle.

3486
04:53:03,000 --> 04:53:10,000
And since both c and u are real numbers, then c times u is a real number, so this vector is in S.

3487
04:53:10,000 --> 04:53:16,000
So we have all three properties satisfied, and therefore S is a subspace of R3.

3488
04:53:16,000 --> 04:53:19,000
Now there's a fair amount of work that went into that.

3489
04:53:19,000 --> 04:53:29,000
And so let's look at how we could use or if we could use this theorem to make the work a little easier.

3490
04:53:29,000 --> 04:53:37,000
All right, if we take a generic vector from the set S and we write it in parametric vector form.

3491
04:53:37,000 --> 04:53:40,000
So that means factor out the parameters.

3492
04:53:40,000 --> 04:53:49,000
In this case, there's only one t, and so we can write any vector in S as t times zero, two, zero, negative one.

3493
04:53:49,000 --> 04:53:54,000
So any vector in S is a multiple of this vector.

3494
04:53:54,000 --> 04:54:00,000
Therefore, S is equal to the span of this vector.

3495
04:54:00,000 --> 04:54:09,000
And since we've written S as the span of a finite set of vectors, that means by the theorem, S is a subspace of R3.

3496
04:54:09,000 --> 04:54:19,000
So you can see here that if your problem is one in which you can use this theorem, then it makes the work much easier.

3497
04:54:19,000 --> 04:54:21,000
Here's another example.

3498
04:54:21,000 --> 04:54:26,000
That set we'll call W. It's a subset of R4.

3499
04:54:26,000 --> 04:54:32,000
And we want to know is W a subspace of R4.

3500
04:54:32,000 --> 04:54:40,000
So again, we could go through the three properties, zero vector closed under addition, closed under scalar multiplication,

3501
04:54:40,000 --> 04:54:45,000
but it's much easier to apply the theorem.

3502
04:54:45,000 --> 04:54:50,000
So here we write this generic vector in parametric vector form.

3503
04:54:50,000 --> 04:54:53,000
There are three parameters here, a, b, and c.

3504
04:54:53,000 --> 04:54:55,000
We factor those out.

3505
04:54:55,000 --> 04:55:06,000
And so at this point, we have written this generic vector as a linear combination of these three vectors.

3506
04:55:06,000 --> 04:55:13,000
That is exactly what it means when we say that W is the span of those vectors.

3507
04:55:13,000 --> 04:55:17,000
Because any vector in W can be written as a linear combination of these three.

3508
04:55:17,000 --> 04:55:24,000
So again, we've got W is the span of a finite set of vectors.

3509
04:55:24,000 --> 04:55:30,000
And so by the theorem, it must be a subspace of R4.

3510
04:55:30,000 --> 04:55:32,000
All right, here's another one.

3511
04:55:32,000 --> 04:55:35,000
Set T given here.

3512
04:55:35,000 --> 04:55:39,000
And we want to know is it a subspace of R3.

3513
04:55:39,000 --> 04:55:42,000
So we proceed as we did before.

3514
04:55:42,000 --> 04:55:43,000
Apply.

3515
04:55:43,000 --> 04:55:52,000
I try to write this generic vector as a linear combination.

3516
04:55:53,000 --> 04:55:55,000
I apologize for the phone there.

3517
04:55:55,000 --> 04:56:02,000
Linear combination of vectors in R3.

3518
04:56:02,000 --> 04:56:07,000
And so we can write it, but notice what happens.

3519
04:56:07,000 --> 04:56:17,000
If we factor out the a and the b, we're left down here with a vector, but no parameter associated with it.

3520
04:56:17,000 --> 04:56:24,000
And so we can't write this vector as a linear combination of vectors.

3521
04:56:24,000 --> 04:56:31,000
Because a linear combination means you've got a parameter or a multiplier in front of each vector.

3522
04:56:31,000 --> 04:56:34,000
And here the multiplier is set at one.

3523
04:56:34,000 --> 04:56:36,000
We can't alter this.

3524
04:56:36,000 --> 04:56:39,000
So this is not a linear combination.

3525
04:56:39,000 --> 04:56:45,000
And so we cannot apply the theorem here.

3526
04:56:45,000 --> 04:56:46,000
All right.

3527
04:56:46,000 --> 04:56:53,000
And so in this case, our only alternative is to go back to the first method.

3528
04:56:53,000 --> 04:57:01,000
And so I'm going to go through that here just because it's always good to have practice in doing that.

3529
04:57:01,000 --> 04:57:06,000
So we look and we say is the zero vector in the set.

3530
04:57:06,000 --> 04:57:14,000
And a lot of times when you have a constant term like this, that's a red flag.

3531
04:57:14,000 --> 04:57:20,000
And you have to think about that very carefully because a lot of times in those cases it will not be a subspace.

3532
04:57:20,000 --> 04:57:27,000
Because in a lot of cases it moves you away from the origin, which means that your set does not contain the origin.

3533
04:57:27,000 --> 04:57:33,000
So that's what we're asking here is the zero vector in T.

3534
04:57:33,000 --> 04:57:43,000
Well, for the zero vector to be in there, that means that each of the elements, we need to be able to make each of the elements equal to zero.

3535
04:57:43,000 --> 04:57:51,000
So if you look at the first or the second component for this to be zero, that means A has to equal 6B.

3536
04:57:51,000 --> 04:57:56,000
And then the third component, it would mean A has to equal negative 2 times B.

3537
04:57:56,000 --> 04:58:04,000
Okay, so if we put that together, then that means that 6B is equal to negative 2B and down here at this point.

3538
04:58:04,000 --> 04:58:09,000
And solving that, that means that B has to be zero.

3539
04:58:09,000 --> 04:58:14,000
Alright, and if B has to be zero, A is 6B, so that means A is zero.

3540
04:58:14,000 --> 04:58:20,000
And in that case, if you look back at the first component, that says you get a one there.

3541
04:58:20,000 --> 04:58:25,000
And so therefore the origin is not contained in this set.

3542
04:58:25,000 --> 04:58:32,000
Alright, because to get zeros in the second and third positions, that means we're going to end up with a one in the first position.

3543
04:58:32,000 --> 04:58:35,000
So T does not contain the zero vector.

3544
04:58:35,000 --> 04:58:41,000
Now at this point, you could stop and say T is not a space of R3.

3545
04:58:41,000 --> 04:58:49,000
But just for practice, I'm going to continue on and say, is T closed under addition?

3546
04:58:49,000 --> 04:58:54,000
And the answer is no, it's not.

3547
04:58:54,000 --> 04:59:00,000
Now to show that, we need to add two vectors together.

3548
04:59:00,000 --> 04:59:10,000
We need to take two vectors from T, add them together, and see if we get another vector that is in the set.

3549
04:59:10,000 --> 04:59:17,000
So I picked 100, it's in the set because it's what we just talked about.

3550
04:59:17,000 --> 04:59:23,000
If the second two components are zero, then the first one has to be one.

3551
04:59:23,000 --> 04:59:28,000
And so 100 is in the set.

3552
04:59:28,000 --> 04:59:31,000
So I'm just going to add it to itself.

3553
04:59:31,000 --> 04:59:35,000
And the result is 200.

3554
04:59:35,000 --> 04:59:38,000
And so let's think, is that in the set?

3555
04:59:38,000 --> 04:59:47,000
And the answer is no, because as we said before, if the second two components are both zero, then the first one has to be one.

3556
04:59:47,000 --> 04:59:55,000
So this vector is not in T, and therefore, T is not closed under addition.

3557
04:59:55,000 --> 05:00:00,000
So just for practice again, let's check, is it closed under scalar multiplication?

3558
05:00:00,000 --> 05:00:10,000
And here we have no, the answer is no, because we've got, again, I just chose 100 because we know that vector is in T.

3559
05:00:10,000 --> 05:00:14,000
And multiply, actually we can multiply by anything other than one.

3560
05:00:14,000 --> 05:00:22,000
I multiply by two, we get 200, and that is not in T.

3561
05:00:22,000 --> 05:00:29,000
All right, so this particular set, T fails all three of those properties.

3562
05:00:29,000 --> 05:00:33,000
Now here's one that looks similar to T.

3563
05:00:33,000 --> 05:00:38,000
It's got the plus one, so it's got that constant term in it.

3564
05:00:38,000 --> 05:00:49,000
But notice here that the A in the first component here is not constrained by anything in the other two components.

3565
05:00:49,000 --> 05:00:52,000
And so this one's a little bit different.

3566
05:00:52,000 --> 05:00:59,000
Still, we cannot apply the theorem because of that one in the first component.

3567
05:00:59,000 --> 05:01:13,000
We cannot write S as a linear combination of vectors because we can't account for that one by doing that.

3568
05:01:13,000 --> 05:01:25,000
So my point really with this example is to show that just because you can't apply the theorem does not mean that the set is not a subspace.

3569
05:01:25,000 --> 05:01:32,000
And so in fact, this one is a subspace of R3, so we're going to go through and just show that.

3570
05:01:32,000 --> 05:01:36,000
So we have to go back to the original method for that.

3571
05:01:36,000 --> 05:01:41,000
And so we ask, is the zero vector in, that should be in the S.

3572
05:01:41,000 --> 05:01:42,000
Sorry about that.

3573
05:01:42,000 --> 05:01:45,000
This is zero vector in the set S.

3574
05:01:45,000 --> 05:01:53,000
And the answer is yes, because B and C can certainly be zero, and we can set A equal to negative one.

3575
05:01:53,000 --> 05:01:58,000
And in that case, we end up with a zero vector.

3576
05:01:58,000 --> 05:02:00,000
Is it closed under addition?

3577
05:02:00,000 --> 05:02:08,000
And the answer is, well, we take two arbitrary elements of the set, say U and V.

3578
05:02:08,000 --> 05:02:12,000
So here's what U looks like, here's what V looks like.

3579
05:02:12,000 --> 05:02:17,000
And when we add those together, we get this vector.

3580
05:02:17,000 --> 05:02:21,000
So just U2 plus V2 in the second component, U3 plus V3 in the third.

3581
05:02:21,000 --> 05:02:25,000
In the first, we get U1 plus V1 plus 2.

3582
05:02:25,000 --> 05:02:29,000
Now you ask, is this vector in the set?

3583
05:02:29,000 --> 05:02:36,000
And the answer is, well, it's not clear from looking at this whether it is or not.

3584
05:02:36,000 --> 05:02:47,000
However, if we write it in this form, then it's clear, because now, obviously the second two components are just real numbers.

3585
05:02:47,000 --> 05:02:58,000
And the first one, by factoring out a plus one, and then gathering what's left here in parentheses.

3586
05:02:58,000 --> 05:03:03,000
Now this thing here, U1 plus V1 plus 1, is a real number.

3587
05:03:03,000 --> 05:03:08,000
And so now, my first component looks like some real number plus one.

3588
05:03:08,000 --> 05:03:12,000
And so that's a real number.

3589
05:03:12,000 --> 05:03:19,000
U1 plus V1 plus 1 is real, U2 plus V2 is real, and U3 plus V3 are real.

3590
05:03:19,000 --> 05:03:27,000
Therefore, U plus V has to be in T, or in S. Sorry about that.

3591
05:03:27,000 --> 05:03:30,000
So it's closed under addition.

3592
05:03:30,000 --> 05:03:34,000
We take a similar approach to show that it's closed under scalar multiplication.

3593
05:03:34,000 --> 05:03:39,000
Again, take a generic vector and a scalar.

3594
05:03:39,000 --> 05:03:42,000
Multiply the two.

3595
05:03:42,000 --> 05:03:52,000
And again, here I had to factor out that plus one, so that I could make it look like the form that it has to be to be in the set.

3596
05:03:52,000 --> 05:03:57,000
And that leaves me, in this case, with this quantity here.

3597
05:03:57,000 --> 05:04:03,000
But that's a real number, right? Because C is real, U1 is real, obviously 1 is real.

3598
05:04:03,000 --> 05:04:05,000
So this quantity is a real number.

3599
05:04:05,000 --> 05:04:10,000
Plus one, and then the second two components are clearly real numbers.

3600
05:04:10,000 --> 05:04:12,000
And that's what it takes to be in the set.

3601
05:04:12,000 --> 05:04:17,000
So we can conclude that the set is closed under scalar multiplication.

3602
05:04:17,000 --> 05:04:22,000
And so it's a subspace of R3.

3603
05:04:22,000 --> 05:04:31,000
Another example, this one, first glance, looks like maybe you could use the theorem here.

3604
05:04:31,000 --> 05:04:35,000
But it turns out that you can't with that A times B in the first component.

3605
05:04:35,000 --> 05:04:39,000
There's no way to break that up in a linear combination.

3606
05:04:39,000 --> 05:04:44,000
And so this one, the theorem, does not apply.

3607
05:04:44,000 --> 05:04:49,000
And so we go back, again, to the original method.

3608
05:04:49,000 --> 05:04:54,000
And look and see, does this contain the zero vector?

3609
05:04:54,000 --> 05:05:01,000
And clearly it does, because you can set A and B both equal to zero, and that gives you the zero vector.

3610
05:05:01,000 --> 05:05:04,000
Is it closed under addition?

3611
05:05:04,000 --> 05:05:10,000
Well, here, let's go back and look at that set.

3612
05:05:10,000 --> 05:05:17,000
Maybe it's not clear, just looking at that, whether it would be closed under addition or not.

3613
05:05:17,000 --> 05:05:23,000
You have to do some thinking, a little work to arrive at a conclusion on that.

3614
05:05:23,000 --> 05:05:28,000
So really there are two approaches you could take.

3615
05:05:28,000 --> 05:05:35,000
One of them is to play around with the numbers and try to find a counter example to show that it's not closed.

3616
05:05:35,000 --> 05:05:45,000
So a counter example would be a specific example, specific numbers that you plug in and show that the set is not closed.

3617
05:05:45,000 --> 05:05:50,000
The other approach is to try to make a formal argument to show that it is closed.

3618
05:05:50,000 --> 05:06:01,000
And whichever one of these you pick really depends on the problem, and whether you have some intuition one way or the other.

3619
05:06:01,000 --> 05:06:06,000
And it also actually depends a little bit on your personality.

3620
05:06:06,000 --> 05:06:12,000
Would you rather play around with the numbers and try to come up with a counter example,

3621
05:06:12,000 --> 05:06:19,000
or would you rather take a more straightforward approach, which is to try to show that it's closed?

3622
05:06:19,000 --> 05:06:26,000
Because a lot of times in that case you're trying to show that it's closed, you will either succeed,

3623
05:06:26,000 --> 05:06:32,000
or you will get to a point where you see why it's not closed.

3624
05:06:32,000 --> 05:06:40,000
And so taking that route is a little more of a deliberate approach.

3625
05:06:40,000 --> 05:06:45,000
Playing with the numbers to try to find a counter example is a little more of a random approach.

3626
05:06:45,000 --> 05:06:52,000
But either is valid, and it kind of depends on, again, on your intuition,

3627
05:06:52,000 --> 05:06:58,000
whether you have a gut feeling one way or the other, and which you'd rather do.

3628
05:06:58,000 --> 05:07:05,000
What you think is the better way to go.

3629
05:07:05,000 --> 05:07:08,000
With this one, I'm going to trace the latter approach.

3630
05:07:08,000 --> 05:07:15,000
Because maybe I don't know, it's just not clear to me whether it's closed or not closed.

3631
05:07:15,000 --> 05:07:18,000
Maybe I don't have a gut feeling on that.

3632
05:07:18,000 --> 05:07:22,000
So I'm just going to take the safe deliberate approach and try to show that it's closed

3633
05:07:22,000 --> 05:07:25,000
and see where that takes me.

3634
05:07:25,000 --> 05:07:28,000
So I picked two arbitrary elements from the set.

3635
05:07:28,000 --> 05:07:32,000
These vectors I've written here, u and v.

3636
05:07:32,000 --> 05:07:37,000
And when I add them together, I get this vector.

3637
05:07:37,000 --> 05:07:44,000
And so what I want to know is if I multiply the second and third terms together,

3638
05:07:44,000 --> 05:07:47,000
does that equal the first term?

3639
05:07:47,000 --> 05:07:55,000
So I'm asking, does first term pq plus xy equal p plus x times q plus y?

3640
05:07:55,000 --> 05:07:57,000
And as I look at that, I say, well, no.

3641
05:07:57,000 --> 05:08:00,000
Sometimes it might, but in general, no.

3642
05:08:00,000 --> 05:08:02,000
That does not hold.

3643
05:08:02,000 --> 05:08:08,000
So that tells me this is probably not closed under addition.

3644
05:08:08,000 --> 05:08:18,000
And so I think I'm going to switch horses now, switch gears and try to find a counter example.

3645
05:08:18,000 --> 05:08:22,000
And so at this point, you kind of scratch this out.

3646
05:08:22,000 --> 05:08:24,000
Consider that to be your scratch work.

3647
05:08:24,000 --> 05:08:26,000
And you start over.

3648
05:08:26,000 --> 05:08:28,000
So start over here.

3649
05:08:28,000 --> 05:08:31,000
And this time, I'm going to try to find a counter example.

3650
05:08:31,000 --> 05:08:38,000
And so my advice is make life simple.

3651
05:08:38,000 --> 05:08:42,000
You can do a lot with just ones and zeros.

3652
05:08:42,000 --> 05:08:46,000
So here I chose u to be 1, 1, 1.

3653
05:08:46,000 --> 05:08:47,000
Second two components are 1.

3654
05:08:47,000 --> 05:08:48,000
Multiply them together.

3655
05:08:48,000 --> 05:08:49,000
You get 1.

3656
05:08:49,000 --> 05:08:52,000
So that means the first component is 1.

3657
05:08:52,000 --> 05:08:56,000
And v, I have 1, 2.

3658
05:08:56,000 --> 05:08:59,000
And the second and third components multiply those together and get 2.

3659
05:08:59,000 --> 05:09:02,000
So the first component in v has to be 2.

3660
05:09:02,000 --> 05:09:03,000
All right.

3661
05:09:03,000 --> 05:09:06,000
So both these vectors are in s.

3662
05:09:06,000 --> 05:09:08,000
And I add them together.

3663
05:09:08,000 --> 05:09:11,000
And so I get this vector 3, 2, 3.

3664
05:09:11,000 --> 05:09:14,000
Just adding component-wise, u and v.

3665
05:09:14,000 --> 05:09:16,000
And then I check, is this vector in s?

3666
05:09:16,000 --> 05:09:17,000
And the answer is no.

3667
05:09:17,000 --> 05:09:23,000
Because when I multiply the second two components together, 2 times 3, I get 6.

3668
05:09:23,000 --> 05:09:26,000
But my first component is not equal to 6.

3669
05:09:27,000 --> 05:09:30,000
It's equal to 3.

3670
05:09:30,000 --> 05:09:35,000
And so this vector, u plus v, is not in s.

3671
05:09:35,000 --> 05:09:39,000
So s is not closed under addition.

3672
05:09:39,000 --> 05:09:42,000
Now at this point, we know that s is not a subspace of r3.

3673
05:09:42,000 --> 05:09:46,000
But again, for practice, let's keep going and look and see,

3674
05:09:46,000 --> 05:09:49,000
well, is it closed under scalar multiplication?

3675
05:09:49,000 --> 05:09:53,000
And again, you got the choice, which approach you want to take.

3676
05:09:53,000 --> 05:09:59,000
Find a counter example or work on a formal argument to show that it is closed.

3677
05:09:59,000 --> 05:10:04,000
In this case, I'm going to think, hmm, you know, it wasn't closed under addition.

3678
05:10:04,000 --> 05:10:10,000
So I'm going to just bet that it's probably not closed under scalar multiplication.

3679
05:10:10,000 --> 05:10:14,000
So I'm going to fudge around and see if I can find a counter example.

3680
05:10:14,000 --> 05:10:18,000
So I need to come up with a vector that's of the general form.

3681
05:10:18,000 --> 05:10:22,000
And a scalar c, such that when I multiply c times the vector,

3682
05:10:22,000 --> 05:10:26,000
I get one that's not in the set.

3683
05:10:26,000 --> 05:10:30,000
This is a trial and error process.

3684
05:10:30,000 --> 05:10:34,000
And again, I would say start simple.

3685
05:10:34,000 --> 05:10:36,000
1's and 0's are good.

3686
05:10:36,000 --> 05:10:39,000
Now from before, we know that 1, 1, 1 is in the set,

3687
05:10:39,000 --> 05:10:43,000
because second two components, 1 times 1, is equal to 1.

3688
05:10:43,000 --> 05:10:49,000
And so, you know, I might multiply by 0, but then I'm going to get 0, 0, 0,

3689
05:10:49,000 --> 05:10:51,000
and that is in the set.

3690
05:10:51,000 --> 05:10:54,000
Multiplying by 1 doesn't do me any good, because that doesn't change the vector.

3691
05:10:54,000 --> 05:10:56,000
I want something that's outside the set.

3692
05:10:56,000 --> 05:10:58,000
So how about 2?

3693
05:10:58,000 --> 05:11:02,000
If I multiply 2 times u, I get 222.

3694
05:11:02,000 --> 05:11:04,000
And then I ask, is that in the set?

3695
05:11:04,000 --> 05:11:08,000
And so you multiply the second and third components together.

3696
05:11:08,000 --> 05:11:13,000
2 times 2 gives you 4, but the first component is not 4.

3697
05:11:13,000 --> 05:11:16,000
So therefore, this vector is not in the set,

3698
05:11:16,000 --> 05:11:23,000
and we've shown that s is not closed under scalar multiplication.

3699
05:11:23,000 --> 05:11:28,000
Okay, and so now you have some examples,

3700
05:11:28,000 --> 05:11:30,000
examples that you can apply this theorem on,

3701
05:11:30,000 --> 05:11:33,000
and some examples that you can't.

3702
05:11:33,000 --> 05:11:37,000
My advice is, you know, to, if you can't apply that theorem,

3703
05:11:37,000 --> 05:11:42,000
you want to, because it makes your life easier, much less work.

3704
05:11:42,000 --> 05:11:45,000
If you can't, then you must go back to the original definition

3705
05:11:45,000 --> 05:11:50,000
and show that the three properties either show that they all hold

3706
05:11:50,000 --> 05:11:54,000
or show that one of them doesn't hold.

3707
05:11:54,000 --> 05:12:00,000
And when you're doing that to show that one of the properties holds,

3708
05:12:00,000 --> 05:12:03,000
you must make a generic argument.

3709
05:12:03,000 --> 05:12:06,000
You know, to show that a set's closed under addition

3710
05:12:06,000 --> 05:12:08,000
or closed under scalar multiplication,

3711
05:12:08,000 --> 05:12:10,000
you must make a generic argument.

3712
05:12:10,000 --> 05:12:15,000
It's not sufficient to show that you can find two vectors

3713
05:12:15,000 --> 05:12:18,000
that you can add together and get one that's in the set.

3714
05:12:18,000 --> 05:12:21,000
You have to show that that holds for any two vectors that you pick,

3715
05:12:21,000 --> 05:12:25,000
and that means you must make a general argument

3716
05:12:25,000 --> 05:12:33,000
to show that a set's not closed under either addition or scalar multiplication.

3717
05:12:33,000 --> 05:12:35,000
You need to find a counter example,

3718
05:12:35,000 --> 05:12:39,000
and a counter example means come up with a specific example

3719
05:12:39,000 --> 05:12:46,000
with real numbers, and by real numbers, I mean actual numbers,

3720
05:12:46,000 --> 05:12:49,000
just like this one that's on your screen now.

3721
05:12:49,000 --> 05:12:55,000
You know, a specific vector, 1, 1, 1, a specific scalar, 2.

3722
05:12:55,000 --> 05:12:58,000
Multiply those together and see what you get

3723
05:12:58,000 --> 05:13:00,000
and show that that's not in the set.

3724
05:13:00,000 --> 05:13:02,000
So that's a counter example.

3725
05:13:02,000 --> 05:13:06,000
So to show that it is closed, make a general argument

3726
05:13:06,000 --> 05:13:15,000
to show that it's not closed, find a specific example.

3727
05:13:15,000 --> 05:13:20,000
In section 4.2, we're going to talk about a couple of concepts

3728
05:13:20,000 --> 05:13:24,000
that aren't familiar with the terminology,

3729
05:13:24,000 --> 05:13:28,000
but we are familiar with the concepts behind these terms.

3730
05:13:28,000 --> 05:13:32,000
First of these is the null space of a matrix.

3731
05:13:32,000 --> 05:13:36,000
We say the null space of an M by N matrix A,

3732
05:13:36,000 --> 05:13:39,000
written as null A,

3733
05:13:39,000 --> 05:13:44,000
is a set of all solutions to the homogeneous equation Ax equals 0.

3734
05:13:44,000 --> 05:13:46,000
So null A is simply a set of all x,

3735
05:13:46,000 --> 05:13:52,000
such that x is in Rn and Ax equals 0.

3736
05:13:52,000 --> 05:13:57,000
X has to be in Rn because A is an M by N matrix,

3737
05:13:57,000 --> 05:14:00,000
and we want to be able to multiply A times x,

3738
05:14:00,000 --> 05:14:04,000
and there must be an entry in x for every column of A,

3739
05:14:04,000 --> 05:14:08,000
and so x must be from Rn.

3740
05:14:08,000 --> 05:14:15,000
So null A is simply the set of all solutions to Ax equals 0.

3741
05:14:15,000 --> 05:14:20,000
The fact that we're calling it the null space probably gives you a clue

3742
05:14:20,000 --> 05:14:22,000
that it's a subspace,

3743
05:14:22,000 --> 05:14:23,000
and indeed it is.

3744
05:14:23,000 --> 05:14:26,000
The theorem here says the null space of an M by N matrix

3745
05:14:26,000 --> 05:14:31,000
is a subspace of Rn.

3746
05:14:31,000 --> 05:14:35,000
Let's look at this matrix A given here.

3747
05:14:35,000 --> 05:14:39,000
To generate an explicit description of null A,

3748
05:14:39,000 --> 05:14:41,000
we have to solve Ax equals 0.

3749
05:14:41,000 --> 05:14:44,000
An explicit description means you can look at it

3750
05:14:44,000 --> 05:14:48,000
and generate an entry in null A.

3751
05:14:48,000 --> 05:14:52,000
So to do that, we have to solve Ax equals 0.

3752
05:14:52,000 --> 05:14:55,000
So we throw that into an augmented matrix

3753
05:14:55,000 --> 05:14:58,000
and do a couple of row operations,

3754
05:14:58,000 --> 05:15:00,000
giving us the matrix given here.

3755
05:15:00,000 --> 05:15:07,000
So we see the general solution is x1 equals 6x2 plus 2x4,

3756
05:15:07,000 --> 05:15:10,000
and x3 equals negative x4,

3757
05:15:10,000 --> 05:15:13,000
and x2 and x4 are free variables.

3758
05:15:13,000 --> 05:15:16,000
If we put it in parametric vector form,

3759
05:15:16,000 --> 05:15:20,000
we have x1 is 6x2 plus 2x4,

3760
05:15:20,000 --> 05:15:25,000
x2 is just x2, and so forth.

3761
05:15:25,000 --> 05:15:28,000
So notice that any vector in the null space of A

3762
05:15:28,000 --> 05:15:32,000
is a linear combination of these two vectors given here.

3763
05:15:32,000 --> 05:15:37,000
So if we look at those,

3764
05:15:37,000 --> 05:15:40,000
we can say any vector in the null space of A

3765
05:15:40,000 --> 05:15:46,000
is in the span of those two vectors.

3766
05:15:46,000 --> 05:15:51,000
And if you remember the theorem from section 4.1,

3767
05:15:51,000 --> 05:15:54,000
it said that if you can write your set

3768
05:15:54,000 --> 05:15:56,000
as the span of a finite set of vectors,

3769
05:15:56,000 --> 05:16:00,000
then it's automatically a subspace of that apparent vector space.

3770
05:16:00,000 --> 05:16:04,000
So here we've written, for this particular matrix A,

3771
05:16:04,000 --> 05:16:07,000
we've written a set of solutions to Ax equals 0

3772
05:16:07,000 --> 05:16:10,000
as the span of these two vectors.

3773
05:16:10,000 --> 05:16:15,000
So therefore, the null space of A is a subspace of R4.

3774
05:16:16,000 --> 05:16:22,000
The second concept that we're going to talk about here

3775
05:16:22,000 --> 05:16:25,000
in this section is the column space of a matrix.

3776
05:16:25,000 --> 05:16:28,000
And once again, it's new terminology,

3777
05:16:28,000 --> 05:16:32,000
but not new fundamental material here.

3778
05:16:32,000 --> 05:16:35,000
The column space of an M by N matrix A,

3779
05:16:35,000 --> 05:16:38,000
which we write as call A,

3780
05:16:38,000 --> 05:16:42,000
is the set of all linear combinations of the columns of A.

3781
05:16:42,000 --> 05:16:47,000
All linear combinations of the columns of A.

3782
05:16:47,000 --> 05:16:51,000
We know that to be the span of the columns of A.

3783
05:16:51,000 --> 05:16:54,000
So if A is equal to A1 through An,

3784
05:16:54,000 --> 05:17:00,000
the column space of A is just the span of A1 through An.

3785
05:17:00,000 --> 05:17:06,000
And since the definition here is that column space of A

3786
05:17:06,000 --> 05:17:08,000
is the span of a set of vectors,

3787
05:17:08,000 --> 05:17:14,000
so it too is a subspace of some vector space.

3788
05:17:14,000 --> 05:17:17,000
In this case, if A is M by N,

3789
05:17:17,000 --> 05:17:21,000
then the column space is going to be in Rm,

3790
05:17:21,000 --> 05:17:26,000
because when you take a linear combination of vectors with M components,

3791
05:17:26,000 --> 05:17:29,000
you're going to get another vector with M components.

3792
05:17:29,000 --> 05:17:35,000
So the column space of A is in Rm.

3793
05:17:35,000 --> 05:17:37,000
Another way to look at the column space of A

3794
05:17:37,000 --> 05:17:39,000
is to write it as a set of all B,

3795
05:17:39,000 --> 05:17:43,000
such that B is equal to A times X for some X in Rn.

3796
05:17:43,000 --> 05:17:45,000
Because when you multiply A times X,

3797
05:17:45,000 --> 05:17:53,000
you're simply taking a linear combination of the columns of A.

3798
05:17:53,000 --> 05:17:56,000
Here's a set S,

3799
05:17:56,000 --> 05:17:59,000
defined in terms of this generic vector,

3800
05:17:59,000 --> 05:18:02,000
and you're asked to find a matrix A

3801
05:18:02,000 --> 05:18:06,000
such that S is equal to the column space of A.

3802
05:18:06,000 --> 05:18:10,000
So we simply take that generic vector,

3803
05:18:10,000 --> 05:18:13,000
write it in parametric vector form,

3804
05:18:13,000 --> 05:18:15,000
so we can write anything in S

3805
05:18:15,000 --> 05:18:20,000
as a linear combination of these three vectors given here.

3806
05:18:20,000 --> 05:18:23,000
So if we put those vectors into a matrix,

3807
05:18:23,000 --> 05:18:26,000
then we can say that anything in S

3808
05:18:26,000 --> 05:18:30,000
is a linear combination of the columns of A.

3809
05:18:30,000 --> 05:18:38,000
And so S is equal to the column space of A.

3810
05:18:38,000 --> 05:18:40,000
As I said before, the null space of A

3811
05:18:40,000 --> 05:18:43,000
and the column space of A are simply new terms

3812
05:18:43,000 --> 05:18:47,000
for describing entities with which we are already familiar.

3813
05:18:47,000 --> 05:18:51,000
Null A is just a set of all solutions to AX equals zero.

3814
05:18:51,000 --> 05:18:57,000
That dates back to section 1.31.4 or somewhere back there.

3815
05:18:57,000 --> 05:19:02,000
A column space of A is just the set of all linear combinations of the columns

3816
05:19:02,000 --> 05:19:05,000
or the span of the columns.

3817
05:19:05,000 --> 05:19:09,000
So again, we're going back to fundamental information

3818
05:19:09,000 --> 05:19:13,000
that we learned in chapter 1.

3819
05:19:13,000 --> 05:19:16,000
Okay, so if we have a matrix A,

3820
05:19:16,000 --> 05:19:19,000
how do we determine if a particular vector X

3821
05:19:19,000 --> 05:19:22,000
is in the null space of that matrix?

3822
05:19:22,000 --> 05:19:25,000
Well, go back to the definition.

3823
05:19:25,000 --> 05:19:29,000
Null space of A is a set of all vectors satisfying AX equals zero.

3824
05:19:29,000 --> 05:19:35,000
So we just need to multiply A times X and see if we get zero.

3825
05:19:35,000 --> 05:19:41,000
Again, to multiply A times X,

3826
05:19:41,000 --> 05:19:45,000
we're taking a linear combination of the columns of A.

3827
05:19:45,000 --> 05:19:47,000
So there needs to be a component of X

3828
05:19:47,000 --> 05:19:50,000
that corresponds to each column of A.

3829
05:19:50,000 --> 05:19:53,000
There are n columns in A,

3830
05:19:53,000 --> 05:19:55,000
and n elements in the null space of A.

3831
05:19:55,000 --> 05:20:02,000
So null A is in Rn.

3832
05:20:02,000 --> 05:20:04,000
Okay, so here's a vector,

3833
05:20:04,000 --> 05:20:08,000
and we're asked is this in the null space of the given matrix?

3834
05:20:08,000 --> 05:20:13,000
So we simply multiply the matrix times this vector.

3835
05:20:13,000 --> 05:20:17,000
So we're taking a linear combination of the columns here

3836
05:20:17,000 --> 05:20:20,000
and go through the arithmetic,

3837
05:20:20,000 --> 05:20:22,000
and we end up with a zero vector.

3838
05:20:22,000 --> 05:20:25,000
So the answer is yes, it is in the null space of A,

3839
05:20:25,000 --> 05:20:29,000
because A times X is equal to zero here.

3840
05:20:29,000 --> 05:20:34,000
Alright, what if we have a matrix A and another vector,

3841
05:20:34,000 --> 05:20:39,000
and we want to know if that vector is in the column space of the matrix?

3842
05:20:39,000 --> 05:20:41,000
So again, look at the definition.

3843
05:20:41,000 --> 05:20:47,000
B is in the column space of A if AX equals B is consistent.

3844
05:20:47,000 --> 05:20:50,000
So we need to solve a system to determine

3845
05:20:50,000 --> 05:20:53,000
if B is in the column space of A.

3846
05:20:53,000 --> 05:21:00,000
And again, the column space of A is going to be a subset of Rm,

3847
05:21:00,000 --> 05:21:06,000
because we're taking linear combinations of vectors with m components,

3848
05:21:06,000 --> 05:21:11,000
and so we get another vector with m components.

3849
05:21:11,000 --> 05:21:14,000
Alright, so here's a vector,

3850
05:21:14,000 --> 05:21:16,000
and we want to know if it's in the column space of A

3851
05:21:16,000 --> 05:21:18,000
for the given matrix A.

3852
05:21:18,000 --> 05:21:22,000
So we need to solve the system,

3853
05:21:22,000 --> 05:21:25,000
set up the augmented matrix, solve the system.

3854
05:21:25,000 --> 05:21:29,000
So I've done that, left out the row operations,

3855
05:21:29,000 --> 05:21:31,000
but we end up with this matrix here.

3856
05:21:31,000 --> 05:21:33,000
And so the question is,

3857
05:21:33,000 --> 05:21:36,000
does this correspond to a consistent system?

3858
05:21:36,000 --> 05:21:37,000
And the answer is yes,

3859
05:21:37,000 --> 05:21:42,000
because we have no rows, zero, zero, zero, something not zero.

3860
05:21:42,000 --> 05:21:46,000
The fact that we have row of all zeros is really irrelevant.

3861
05:21:46,000 --> 05:21:49,000
The fact that we have free variable is irrelevant.

3862
05:21:49,000 --> 05:21:54,000
The only thing that's relevant is that we don't have a row that's zero, zero, zero,

3863
05:21:54,000 --> 05:21:58,000
not zero, because that would tell us it's inconsistent.

3864
05:21:58,000 --> 05:22:00,000
So since the system is consistent,

3865
05:22:00,000 --> 05:22:06,000
that means that this vector is indeed in the column space of A.

3866
05:22:06,000 --> 05:22:09,000
Alright, let's look at this example.

3867
05:22:09,000 --> 05:22:12,000
Here's the set W, and we're asked,

3868
05:22:12,000 --> 05:22:17,000
is it a subspace of R4?

3869
05:22:17,000 --> 05:22:19,000
So we can write it,

3870
05:22:19,000 --> 05:22:22,000
write any generic element of W

3871
05:22:22,000 --> 05:22:24,000
as the linear combination of these two vectors.

3872
05:22:24,000 --> 05:22:27,000
So we write it in parametric vector form.

3873
05:22:27,000 --> 05:22:31,000
And so we can say that W is equal to column space of this matrix.

3874
05:22:31,000 --> 05:22:34,000
Just taking these two vectors, sticking them in the columns of a matrix.

3875
05:22:34,000 --> 05:22:40,000
The column space of this matrix is all linear combinations of these columns,

3876
05:22:40,000 --> 05:22:42,000
which is exactly W.

3877
05:22:42,000 --> 05:22:48,000
So that means that W is a subspace.

3878
05:22:48,000 --> 05:22:51,000
Alright, how about this example?

3879
05:22:51,000 --> 05:23:01,000
This one, it's not so easy or so clear to see,

3880
05:23:01,000 --> 05:23:08,000
because we have this constant term one here,

3881
05:23:08,000 --> 05:23:16,000
and so we can't write this set as a linear combination of vectors.

3882
05:23:16,000 --> 05:23:19,000
So in this case, we have to go back to the definition of subspace.

3883
05:23:19,000 --> 05:23:25,000
That's those three properties that every subspace must satisfy.

3884
05:23:25,000 --> 05:23:30,000
So first one was does it contain the zero vector?

3885
05:23:30,000 --> 05:23:34,000
And if we look, for it to contain the zero vector,

3886
05:23:34,000 --> 05:23:38,000
clearly D has to be zero,

3887
05:23:38,000 --> 05:23:44,000
which would mean that the second component would be two times zero plus one,

3888
05:23:44,000 --> 05:23:46,000
which is one.

3889
05:23:46,000 --> 05:23:49,000
And so if you get zero here, you're going to have one up here.

3890
05:23:49,000 --> 05:23:55,000
And therefore, the zero vector is not in this set.

3891
05:23:55,000 --> 05:24:01,000
So it is not a subspace of R4.

3892
05:24:01,000 --> 05:24:05,000
About this set, is this set a subspace of R4?

3893
05:24:05,000 --> 05:24:11,000
So we've got all vectors A, B, C, D that satisfy these two equations.

3894
05:24:11,000 --> 05:24:15,000
There's actually two ways we could go about doing this,

3895
05:24:15,000 --> 05:24:19,000
using what we've learned in this section.

3896
05:24:19,000 --> 05:24:22,000
One is easier than the other.

3897
05:24:22,000 --> 05:24:27,000
Let's take the hard way first.

3898
05:24:27,000 --> 05:24:33,000
And we're going to try to write S as the column space of some matrix A.

3899
05:24:33,000 --> 05:24:37,000
So we need to figure out what A would be.

3900
05:24:37,000 --> 05:24:40,000
We're going to simplify things a little bit.

3901
05:24:40,000 --> 05:24:45,000
Instead of C here, we're just going to substitute A plus 3B.

3902
05:24:45,000 --> 05:24:49,000
And then instead of D, we're going to substitute A plus B plus C.

3903
05:24:49,000 --> 05:24:55,000
But we're going to plug in what C is since we've gotten rid of C.

3904
05:24:55,000 --> 05:25:02,000
So D is B plus C plus A, and C is A plus 3B.

3905
05:25:02,000 --> 05:25:04,000
So plug that in for C.

3906
05:25:04,000 --> 05:25:08,000
And we end up with D equals 2A plus 4B.

3907
05:25:08,000 --> 05:25:13,000
So we can write any vector in S in this form.

3908
05:25:13,000 --> 05:25:19,000
So we replace C with A plus 3B and D with 2A plus 4B.

3909
05:25:19,000 --> 05:25:25,000
And then it's just a matter of writing that in parametric vector form

3910
05:25:25,000 --> 05:25:27,000
and throwing those columns into a matrix.

3911
05:25:27,000 --> 05:25:33,000
And so S is equal to the column space of A, where A is given here.

3912
05:25:33,000 --> 05:25:38,000
And thus, S would be a subspace of R4,

3913
05:25:38,000 --> 05:25:42,000
since the column space of any matrix is a subspace.

3914
05:25:42,000 --> 05:25:46,000
Now the other way to look at it, so I rewrote the problem here.

3915
05:25:46,000 --> 05:25:52,000
The other way to look at it is to note that we could write S in this form.

3916
05:25:52,000 --> 05:25:57,000
So basically I've taken these two equations that we have here.

3917
05:25:57,000 --> 05:26:01,000
And I've taken all the variables over to the left side.

3918
05:26:01,000 --> 05:26:04,000
And so we've got zeros on the right.

3919
05:26:04,000 --> 05:26:09,000
And so when you see zeros on the right, you should think,

3920
05:26:09,000 --> 05:26:12,000
that's a homogeneous system.

3921
05:26:12,000 --> 05:26:18,000
And so we can write S as the null space of A,

3922
05:26:18,000 --> 05:26:23,000
where A is equal to the coefficient matrix from this system of equations.

3923
05:26:23,000 --> 05:26:30,000
So you see 1, 3, negative 1 for ABC and then 0 for D and from the first equation.

3924
05:26:30,000 --> 05:26:36,000
And then the second equation we get 1 times A plus 1 times B plus 1 times C minus 1 times D.

3925
05:26:36,000 --> 05:26:39,000
So that's where the second row comes from.

3926
05:26:39,000 --> 05:26:41,000
So remember what the null space of a matrix is.

3927
05:26:41,000 --> 05:26:45,000
It's just the set of all solutions to AX equals 0.

3928
05:26:45,000 --> 05:26:50,000
And so I've just taken this system of equations, written it,

3929
05:26:50,000 --> 05:26:55,000
or taken these equations, written them as a homogeneous system.

3930
05:26:55,000 --> 05:27:01,000
And then I can use the fact that the null space of a matrix is always a subspace.

3931
05:27:01,000 --> 05:27:02,000
And we're done.

3932
05:27:02,000 --> 05:27:05,000
So that's why I said one was harder than the other.

3933
05:27:05,000 --> 05:27:10,000
This is clearly the easiest way.

3934
05:27:10,000 --> 05:27:15,000
All right.

3935
05:27:15,000 --> 05:27:22,000
Let's revisit the concept of linear transformations for just a bit.

3936
05:27:22,000 --> 05:27:30,000
And this is, again, back to chapter 1, where we talked about linear transformations.

3937
05:27:30,000 --> 05:27:38,000
One new term that we didn't learn back in chapter 1 was the idea of the kernel of a linear transformation.

3938
05:27:38,000 --> 05:27:46,000
And the kernel of a linear transformation is simply the set of all vectors that map to the 0 vector.

3939
05:27:46,000 --> 05:27:59,000
So the kernel of a linear transformation is exactly the null space of the matrix that defines the transformation.

3940
05:27:59,000 --> 05:28:05,000
So kernel and null space are analogous concepts.

3941
05:28:05,000 --> 05:28:13,000
The range of a transformation is the set of all vectors that get mapped to.

3942
05:28:13,000 --> 05:28:17,000
So the range is in the co-domain.

3943
05:28:17,000 --> 05:28:19,000
Sometimes it's all of the co-domain.

3944
05:28:19,000 --> 05:28:20,000
Sometimes not.

3945
05:28:20,000 --> 05:28:29,000
But the range is a set of all vectors that get mapped to by some vector from the domain.

3946
05:28:29,000 --> 05:28:42,000
And so the range of t is actually the column space of a, where a is the matrix that defines the transformation.

3947
05:28:42,000 --> 05:28:46,000
So the kernel of the transformation is the null space of a.

3948
05:28:46,000 --> 05:28:52,000
The range of the transformation is the column space of a.

3949
05:28:52,000 --> 05:29:04,000
Okay, last I want to talk about just looking at the contrast between the null space of a matrix and the column space.

3950
05:29:04,000 --> 05:29:09,000
These really on the surface are very different sets.

3951
05:29:09,000 --> 05:29:13,000
We will kind of pull them together a little bit later on in this chapter.

3952
05:29:13,000 --> 05:29:24,000
But for right now, they're really very different sets and they don't share analogous sorts of ideas.

3953
05:29:24,000 --> 05:29:28,000
But that's kind of the extent of it at this point.

3954
05:29:28,000 --> 05:29:31,000
So let's assume a is an m by n matrix.

3955
05:29:31,000 --> 05:29:37,000
Then the null space is in our n column space is in our m.

3956
05:29:37,000 --> 05:29:40,000
The null space is implicitly defined.

3957
05:29:40,000 --> 05:29:45,000
That means you're given a condition that vectors in the null space must satisfy.

3958
05:29:45,000 --> 05:29:51,000
But you can't look at a matrix a and know which vectors are in it.

3959
05:29:51,000 --> 05:29:55,000
You have to solve that system a equals zero.

3960
05:29:55,000 --> 05:29:59,000
On the other hand, the column space of a is explicitly defined.

3961
05:29:59,000 --> 05:30:03,000
Because it's just the set of all linear combinations of the columns.

3962
05:30:03,000 --> 05:30:11,000
So you can look at the matrix a and you know that the columns that you're looking at are actually in the column space.

3963
05:30:11,000 --> 05:30:16,000
And you know how to create more entries in the column space.

3964
05:30:16,000 --> 05:30:19,000
To find vectors in the null space requires work.

3965
05:30:19,000 --> 05:30:23,000
You have to solve the system a x equals zero.

3966
05:30:23,000 --> 05:30:28,000
Note, however, that the zero vector is always in the null space of a.

3967
05:30:28,000 --> 05:30:36,000
Because a times the zero vector gives you the zero vector.

3968
05:30:36,000 --> 05:30:41,000
To find vectors in the column space of a, you just compute linear combinations of the columns.

3969
05:30:41,000 --> 05:30:48,000
So it's a direct process to do that.

3970
05:30:48,000 --> 05:30:52,000
There's no obvious relationship between null a and the entries in a.

3971
05:30:52,000 --> 05:31:02,000
On the other hand, the relationship between a and the column space of a is obvious since each column is in the column space.

3972
05:31:02,000 --> 05:31:08,000
The typical vector v in the null space satisfies a times v equals zero.

3973
05:31:08,000 --> 05:31:16,000
Typical vector in the column space has the property that a x equals v is consistent.

3974
05:31:16,000 --> 05:31:24,000
For null space, you're multiplying a times v to see if you get zero.

3975
05:31:24,000 --> 05:31:29,000
To see if a vector is in the column space, you're solving a system a x equals v.

3976
05:31:29,000 --> 05:31:32,000
So v is on the right hand side in that case.

3977
05:31:32,000 --> 05:31:37,000
Given a specific vector v, it's easy to determine if v is in the null space.

3978
05:31:37,000 --> 05:31:40,000
You just see if a times v is equal to zero.

3979
05:31:40,000 --> 05:31:45,000
To determine if v is in the column space, you have to solve a system of equations.

3980
05:31:46,000 --> 05:31:58,000
The null space equals only the zero vector if and only if a x equals zero has only the trivial solution.

3981
05:31:58,000 --> 05:32:00,000
So how do you get what's in the null space?

3982
05:32:00,000 --> 05:32:02,000
We have to solve a x equals zero.

3983
05:32:02,000 --> 05:32:09,000
And if you get only the trivial solution, then that means there's only one solution, which is a zero vector.

3984
05:32:10,000 --> 05:32:18,000
The column space of a is equal to r m if and only if a x equals b is consistent for every b in r m.

3985
05:32:18,000 --> 05:32:26,000
That means that everything, no matter what you put on the right hand side, the system will be consistent.

3986
05:32:26,000 --> 05:32:30,000
So every b is a linear combination of the columns of a.

3987
05:32:30,000 --> 05:32:38,000
And then relating it to linear transformations, the null space of a is equal to the zero vector only.

3988
05:32:38,000 --> 05:32:43,000
If and only if the transformation x to a x is one to one.

3989
05:32:43,000 --> 05:32:53,000
So if you back up to the previous one, we had that null a is equal to only the zero vector if a x equals zero has only the trivial solution.

3990
05:32:53,000 --> 05:33:02,000
Remember that's going to occur when you have no free variables and or if there's a pivot position in every column.

3991
05:33:02,000 --> 05:33:07,000
And so we know that indicates that the transformation is one to one.

3992
05:33:07,000 --> 05:33:15,000
And then the column space is equal to r m if and only if a x equals b is consistent for every b.

3993
05:33:15,000 --> 05:33:19,000
So that means every b in the co domain gets mapped to.

3994
05:33:19,000 --> 05:33:23,000
So the transformation must be onto r m.

3995
05:33:23,000 --> 05:33:35,000
Okay, we're going to start today talking about a basis for a vector space.

3996
05:33:35,000 --> 05:33:52,000
And the idea of a basis is that it's a minimal in terms of number of vectors and representative in that it represents the vector space.

3997
05:33:52,000 --> 05:33:57,000
Set, so it's a minimal representative set.

3998
05:33:57,000 --> 05:34:03,000
So let's explore what that actually means.

3999
05:34:03,000 --> 05:34:13,000
Before we really get into that, let's back up a little bit and remember what a couple of concepts are that are key here.

4000
05:34:13,000 --> 05:34:17,000
One is linear independence and the other is spanning.

4001
05:34:17,000 --> 05:34:20,000
So let's start with linear independence.

4002
05:34:20,000 --> 05:34:22,000
So here's a definition.

4003
05:34:22,000 --> 05:34:28,000
A set of vectors v1 through vp is said to be linearly independent.

4004
05:34:28,000 --> 05:34:37,000
If the only solution to the equation, we take a linear combination of the vectors and set it equal to zero.

4005
05:34:37,000 --> 05:34:40,000
This linear combination set equal to zero.

4006
05:34:40,000 --> 05:34:47,000
The only solution to that is when you set all the coefficients equal to zero.

4007
05:34:47,000 --> 05:34:51,000
Note that this is always a solution.

4008
05:34:51,000 --> 05:34:55,000
We can always set the coefficients equal to zero and generate the zero vector.

4009
05:34:55,000 --> 05:34:59,000
What we want to know is if this is the only solution.

4010
05:34:59,000 --> 05:35:07,000
So thinking in terms of a system of equations, we know the system's consistent.

4011
05:35:07,000 --> 05:35:13,000
We want to know if the solution is unique or if they're an infinite number of solutions.

4012
05:35:13,000 --> 05:35:16,000
So that's when we get into talking about free variables.

4013
05:35:16,000 --> 05:35:20,000
Does the system have a free variable or not?

4014
05:35:20,000 --> 05:35:26,000
So we set up that augmented matrix for that system.

4015
05:35:26,000 --> 05:35:30,000
We put an initial inform and we want to see if there are free variables.

4016
05:35:30,000 --> 05:35:38,000
Because if there are free variables, that means an infinite number of solutions and the vectors would not be linearly independent.

4017
05:35:38,000 --> 05:35:50,000
And if we don't have free variables, that means the solution is unique so the vectors are linearly independent.

4018
05:35:50,000 --> 05:35:59,000
So to check for linear independence, we really don't have to tack on that zero column on the augmented side.

4019
05:35:59,000 --> 05:36:06,000
We can just look at the coefficient matrix, put it in an initial inform and see if there's a pivot position in every column.

4020
05:36:06,000 --> 05:36:09,000
Because we want to know are there free variables or not.

4021
05:36:09,000 --> 05:36:15,000
So is there a pivot position in every column?

4022
05:36:15,000 --> 05:36:19,000
Okay, there are a few cases that are obvious.

4023
05:36:19,000 --> 05:36:27,000
One is where you have more vectors than you have entries in each vector like this matrix given here.

4024
05:36:27,000 --> 05:36:33,000
These three vectors could not be linearly independent because you have three vectors in R2.

4025
05:36:33,000 --> 05:36:40,000
There's no way you can have a pivot position in each column.

4026
05:36:40,000 --> 05:36:46,000
If you just have two vectors, they're linearly independent if neither is a multiple of the other.

4027
05:36:46,000 --> 05:36:51,000
And in general, a set of vectors is linearly independent if none.

4028
05:36:51,000 --> 05:37:00,000
Okay, I can't find any of the vectors in the set that can be written as a linear combination of the others.

4029
05:37:00,000 --> 05:37:04,000
Alright, let's move on to spanning sets.

4030
05:37:04,000 --> 05:37:10,000
Take that same set of vectors, v1 through vp, and assume they're in Rn.

4031
05:37:10,000 --> 05:37:18,000
And they are said to span Rn if the equation, where you take a linear combination of those vectors and set it equal to b,

4032
05:37:18,000 --> 05:37:22,000
is consistent for every b in Rn.

4033
05:37:22,000 --> 05:37:29,000
That means you can take a linear combination of those vectors and generate any vector in Rn.

4034
05:37:29,000 --> 05:37:37,000
Now obviously we can't solve this system for every b in Rn.

4035
05:37:37,000 --> 05:37:42,000
So how do we know if it's going to be consistent for every b or not?

4036
05:37:42,000 --> 05:37:48,000
Then linear independence, right hand side was zero, we can solve that system.

4037
05:37:48,000 --> 05:37:51,000
But here we want it to be consistent for every b.

4038
05:37:51,000 --> 05:37:57,000
So we can't go and plug in every possible vector b on the right and solve the system

4039
05:37:57,000 --> 05:38:00,000
to see if it's going to be consistent for everyone.

4040
05:38:00,000 --> 05:38:02,000
So what do we do?

4041
05:38:02,000 --> 05:38:17,000
Well, we know that it will be consistent if we never end up with a row where we've got all zeros and then something not zero on the right hand side.

4042
05:38:17,000 --> 05:38:21,000
When we put the matrix in echelon form.

4043
05:38:21,000 --> 05:38:28,000
So if we have this, where all zeros and then something not zero, then it's inconsistent.

4044
05:38:28,000 --> 05:38:38,000
So we want to know if we never get that in the way that that happens is we have a pivot position in every row.

4045
05:38:38,000 --> 05:38:43,000
If there's a pivot position in every row of the coefficient part of the matrix,

4046
05:38:43,000 --> 05:38:49,000
then you'll never end up with all zeros in a row of the coefficient part of the matrix.

4047
05:38:49,000 --> 05:39:01,000
So to check to see if a set of vectors is spans, whatever vector space they're in,

4048
05:39:01,000 --> 05:39:07,000
we need to have a pivot position in every row.

4049
05:39:07,000 --> 05:39:13,000
So the columns of A are linearly independent if there's a pivot position in every column of A

4050
05:39:13,000 --> 05:39:19,000
and they span RM if there's a pivot position in every row of A.

4051
05:39:19,000 --> 05:39:25,000
It's assuming A is an M by N matrix, so the columns are in RM.

4052
05:39:25,000 --> 05:39:27,000
Alright, so let's look at some examples.

4053
05:39:27,000 --> 05:39:30,000
Here's a set with just one vector.

4054
05:39:30,000 --> 05:39:33,000
Is it linearly independent?

4055
05:39:33,000 --> 05:39:40,000
And the answer is yes, because you have a single non-zero vector.

4056
05:39:40,000 --> 05:39:43,000
It's always going to be linearly independent.

4057
05:39:43,000 --> 05:39:51,000
The only time just a single vector is linearly dependent is if that vector is the zero vector.

4058
05:39:51,000 --> 05:39:54,000
Does this set span R2?

4059
05:39:54,000 --> 05:40:01,000
And the answer is no, because if you look at all linear combinations of that vector,

4060
05:40:01,000 --> 05:40:06,000
you're just getting multiples of that vector, which is a line in R2.

4061
05:40:06,000 --> 05:40:11,000
So you only get a line, not all of R2.

4062
05:40:11,000 --> 05:40:16,000
Alright, let's look at this set T.

4063
05:40:16,000 --> 05:40:25,000
Now I've got three vectors and first let's ask is T linearly independent?

4064
05:40:25,000 --> 05:40:33,000
And the answer is no, because you've got more vectors than there are entries in each vector.

4065
05:40:33,000 --> 05:40:40,000
So if you put those vectors in a matrix, there's no way you can have a pivot position in every column.

4066
05:40:40,000 --> 05:40:44,000
Does this set span R2?

4067
05:40:44,000 --> 05:40:52,000
Yes, because if you just even look at the first two vectors, they are not multiples of each other,

4068
05:40:52,000 --> 05:40:58,000
and so not collinear, so they will span the plane.

4069
05:40:58,000 --> 05:41:05,000
Now if you want to go back and just look at it in matrix form, take those vectors,

4070
05:41:05,000 --> 05:41:12,000
put them in a matrix, put it in echelon form, and look and see, do you have a pivot position in every column?

4071
05:41:12,000 --> 05:41:15,000
No, so they're not linearly independent.

4072
05:41:15,000 --> 05:41:17,000
Do you have a pivot position in every row?

4073
05:41:17,000 --> 05:41:25,000
Yes, so they do span R2.

4074
05:41:25,000 --> 05:41:29,000
Okay, now let's look at one more set.

4075
05:41:29,000 --> 05:41:34,000
Now this one is like the other one, except I just took out that last vector.

4076
05:41:34,000 --> 05:41:37,000
So again, is it linearly independent?

4077
05:41:37,000 --> 05:41:46,000
Yes, we've got two vectors and neither is a multiple of the other, so they're linearly independent.

4078
05:41:46,000 --> 05:41:48,000
So it's span R2.

4079
05:41:48,000 --> 05:41:51,000
Notice that should be U instead of T there.

4080
05:41:51,000 --> 05:41:53,000
Does it span R2?

4081
05:41:53,000 --> 05:41:59,000
And again, it's yes for the same reason as that used before.

4082
05:41:59,000 --> 05:42:01,000
Look at it in matrix form.

4083
05:42:01,000 --> 05:42:06,000
You've got a pivot position in every row, so the vectors span R2.

4084
05:42:06,000 --> 05:42:11,000
You have a pivot position in each column, so they're linearly independent.

4085
05:42:11,000 --> 05:42:21,000
So we see that any set that spans R2 has to have at least two vectors because you have to have one in each row, a pivot position in each row.

4086
05:42:21,000 --> 05:42:27,000
Any set that's linearly independent must have two or fewer vectors, right?

4087
05:42:27,000 --> 05:42:31,000
Because once you get over two, you can't have a pivot position in each column.

4088
05:42:31,000 --> 05:42:40,000
So any set that's both linearly independent and spans R2 has to have exactly two vectors, right?

4089
05:42:40,000 --> 05:42:45,000
Exactly two, because to span, it needs at least two.

4090
05:42:45,000 --> 05:42:48,000
To be linearly independent, it needs no more than two.

4091
05:42:48,000 --> 05:42:54,000
So if you want both, then you have to have exactly two vectors.

4092
05:42:54,000 --> 05:43:03,000
Such a set that's both linearly independent and spans R2 is said to be a basis for R2.

4093
05:43:03,000 --> 05:43:05,000
Here's a formal definition.

4094
05:43:05,000 --> 05:43:19,000
Set of vectors b1 through bp is a basis for some subspace h if the set's linearly independent and the span of the set is the subspace.

4095
05:43:19,000 --> 05:43:23,000
Okay, so we need two pieces to be a basis.

4096
05:43:23,000 --> 05:43:28,000
One linear independence, the other must span the subspace.

4097
05:43:28,000 --> 05:43:31,000
So look at a few examples.

4098
05:43:31,000 --> 05:43:38,000
Here's a set, and I want to know is this a basis for R3?

4099
05:43:38,000 --> 05:43:47,000
So pick one of the criteria, either linearly independent or spans, and see if those are satisfied.

4100
05:43:47,000 --> 05:43:51,000
So let's start off with is it linearly independent?

4101
05:43:51,000 --> 05:43:59,000
Well, if you set up the augmented matrix, set it equal to zero,

4102
05:43:59,000 --> 05:44:06,000
then you can clearly see you don't have a pivot position in the second column here,

4103
05:44:06,000 --> 05:44:10,000
and so can't be linearly independent.

4104
05:44:10,000 --> 05:44:13,000
So it's not a basis.

4105
05:44:13,000 --> 05:44:15,000
Alright, about another set.

4106
05:44:15,000 --> 05:44:23,000
There's one not so clear here whether these vectors are linearly independent.

4107
05:44:23,000 --> 05:44:33,000
So we put them in a matrix, do some row operations, and we end up here with a coefficient matrix.

4108
05:44:33,000 --> 05:44:40,000
Notice it has a pivot position in every column, so the only solution is the trivial solution.

4109
05:44:40,000 --> 05:44:44,000
Therefore, the vectors are linearly independent.

4110
05:44:44,000 --> 05:44:50,000
We can also look at the matrix here and see that there's a pivot position in every row.

4111
05:44:50,000 --> 05:44:56,000
So they span R3, and therefore they must be a basis for R3.

4112
05:44:56,000 --> 05:45:01,000
So the key is looking at the coefficient matrix in echelon form.

4113
05:45:01,000 --> 05:45:05,000
You can see a pivot position in every column, so they're linearly independent,

4114
05:45:05,000 --> 05:45:11,000
pivot position in every row, so they span R3.

4115
05:45:11,000 --> 05:45:15,000
Now here's another set, is this a basis for R3?

4116
05:45:15,000 --> 05:45:20,000
And you're probably thinking, well, there's only two vectors,

4117
05:45:20,000 --> 05:45:27,000
and in R3 you need three vectors to span, and that's right, because if you look at that matrix,

4118
05:45:27,000 --> 05:45:33,000
you can't have a pivot position in every row, so therefore these vectors can't span R3,

4119
05:45:33,000 --> 05:45:38,000
and therefore can't be a basis for R3.

4120
05:45:38,000 --> 05:45:40,000
Now how about this one?

4121
05:45:40,000 --> 05:45:45,000
Look at this one, maybe you're thinking, oh, we've got four vectors in R3,

4122
05:45:45,000 --> 05:45:48,000
they can't be linearly independent, right?

4123
05:45:48,000 --> 05:45:57,000
Because if you put them in a matrix, there's no way to have a pivot position in every column.

4124
05:45:57,000 --> 05:46:01,000
We've got four vectors, only three rows, can't have a pivot position in every column,

4125
05:46:01,000 --> 05:46:05,000
so not linearly independent.

4126
05:46:05,000 --> 05:46:09,000
Now here's a little different question.

4127
05:46:09,000 --> 05:46:17,000
Here I've got a set of four vectors, and I'm not asking though, is this a basis for R3?

4128
05:46:17,000 --> 05:46:23,000
Clearly it's not, because four vectors can't be linearly independent.

4129
05:46:23,000 --> 05:46:30,000
What I'm asking though is for you to find a basis for the span of this set.

4130
05:46:30,000 --> 05:46:34,000
Okay, so we don't really know what the span of this set is,

4131
05:46:34,000 --> 05:46:41,000
it's either all of R3 or some piece of R3, we don't know.

4132
05:46:41,000 --> 05:46:52,000
So we want to know whatever that space is, what is the basis for it?

4133
05:46:52,000 --> 05:46:57,000
Well, one of the criteria for a basis is that it spans the set.

4134
05:46:57,000 --> 05:47:06,000
So clearly, if we just take all four vectors, they're going to span W, because that's how W is defined.

4135
05:47:06,000 --> 05:47:08,000
So the question is, are they linearly independent?

4136
05:47:08,000 --> 05:47:16,000
And we already know that they're not, because there's four vectors in R3.

4137
05:47:16,000 --> 05:47:21,000
So remember, since they're not linearly independent,

4138
05:47:21,000 --> 05:47:26,000
then that means that at least one of them is a linear combination of the others.

4139
05:47:26,000 --> 05:47:34,000
And so one strategy would be to throw out the ones that are dependent on the others,

4140
05:47:34,000 --> 05:47:43,000
and then reduce that down to where we have a linearly independent set.

4141
05:47:43,000 --> 05:47:50,000
Now in this case, I'll point out to you that the second vector here is twice the first,

4142
05:47:50,000 --> 05:47:55,000
you can look at that, two times one is two, two times negative four, negative eight, and so forth.

4143
05:47:55,000 --> 05:48:00,000
And the last one, vector four here, is the sum of the first and the third.

4144
05:48:00,000 --> 05:48:07,000
So we've got one plus zero gives you one, negative four plus three is negative one, so forth.

4145
05:48:07,000 --> 05:48:14,000
So that tells us that the second vector is dependent on the first.

4146
05:48:14,000 --> 05:48:21,000
It's a linear combination of the first, and the last one is a linear combination of the first and the third.

4147
05:48:21,000 --> 05:48:24,000
So it seems like we should be able to throw those out.

4148
05:48:24,000 --> 05:48:27,000
We don't need them.

4149
05:48:27,000 --> 05:48:31,000
And if we do, then we're left with these two vectors,

4150
05:48:31,000 --> 05:48:36,000
and we can look at it and see that it's linearly independent,

4151
05:48:36,000 --> 05:48:40,000
because we've got two vectors that are not multiples of each other.

4152
05:48:40,000 --> 05:48:47,000
It's still a little iffy on whether this set spans the original set W.

4153
05:48:47,000 --> 05:48:55,000
So because we threw out some, how do we know that these two still span the subspace?

4154
05:48:55,000 --> 05:49:01,000
Well, let's introduce a little shortcut notation here.

4155
05:49:01,000 --> 05:49:07,000
Let's say we're going to call the four original vectors V1 through V4.

4156
05:49:07,000 --> 05:49:18,000
And so any vector in the span of those vectors, or any vector in W, can be written in this form.

4157
05:49:18,000 --> 05:49:20,000
Linear combination of those four vectors.

4158
05:49:20,000 --> 05:49:28,000
Now, we know, though, that V2, the second vector, was two times the first one.

4159
05:49:28,000 --> 05:49:34,000
So we have this relationship here, and we know that V4 was the sum of the first and the third.

4160
05:49:34,000 --> 05:49:36,000
So we have this relationship.

4161
05:49:36,000 --> 05:49:40,000
So we can plug that in back up in this equation.

4162
05:49:40,000 --> 05:49:46,000
So substituting for V2, we can plug in 2V1.

4163
05:49:46,000 --> 05:49:50,000
And for V4, we can plug in V1 plus V3.

4164
05:49:50,000 --> 05:49:57,000
And then if we do a little rearranging, we can write V as just a linear combination of V1 and V3.

4165
05:49:57,000 --> 05:50:00,000
We've got different coefficients, but that's okay.

4166
05:50:00,000 --> 05:50:03,000
Just needs to be a linear combination of V1 and V3.

4167
05:50:03,000 --> 05:50:15,000
So here, we've shown that any vector that was a linear combination of V1, V2, V3, V4 is also a linear combination of just V1 and V3.

4168
05:50:15,000 --> 05:50:24,000
Therefore, just V1 and V3, just those two vectors, will span W.

4169
05:50:24,000 --> 05:50:26,000
And we've already said that they're linearly independent.

4170
05:50:26,000 --> 05:50:29,000
So therefore, they are a basis for W.

4171
05:50:30,000 --> 05:50:37,000
So we start off with our big set throughout the ones that were dependent on the others.

4172
05:50:37,000 --> 05:50:42,000
And what we were left with still spans, and it's linearly independent.

4173
05:50:42,000 --> 05:50:44,000
So it's a basis.

4174
05:50:46,000 --> 05:50:51,000
Now, in that problem, I told you which vectors were dependent on the others.

4175
05:50:51,000 --> 05:50:55,000
So what can you do when that's not so obvious?

4176
05:50:55,000 --> 05:51:02,000
How can you figure out which ones are dependent when you can't just look at it and tell?

4177
05:51:02,000 --> 05:51:06,000
Well, there's an amazing thing.

4178
05:51:06,000 --> 05:51:17,000
And that is that when you do elementary row operations, the dependence relations among the columns are not changed.

4179
05:51:17,000 --> 05:51:22,000
So these are the four vectors we had before.

4180
05:51:22,000 --> 05:51:25,000
Remember, the second one is two times the first.

4181
05:51:25,000 --> 05:51:28,000
The last one is the sum of the first and the third.

4182
05:51:28,000 --> 05:51:32,000
Alright, so I put it in echelon form, and I get this matrix.

4183
05:51:32,000 --> 05:51:37,000
And look, the second column here is two times the first, right?

4184
05:51:37,000 --> 05:51:42,000
Two times one is two, two times zero zero, two times zero zero.

4185
05:51:42,000 --> 05:51:47,000
And the last column is still the sum of the first and the third.

4186
05:51:47,000 --> 05:51:51,000
One plus zero is one, zero plus one is one, zero plus zero zero.

4187
05:51:51,000 --> 05:51:58,000
So you can take your original matrix or original vectors, throw them in a matrix,

4188
05:51:58,000 --> 05:52:03,000
put the matrix in echelon form or reduced echelon form, it doesn't matter.

4189
05:52:03,000 --> 05:52:14,000
And in that matrix, the vectors will still exhibit the same relationships among each other.

4190
05:52:14,000 --> 05:52:22,000
So what you see here is that the ones that we want to keep are the ones where we have pivot positions.

4191
05:52:22,000 --> 05:52:30,000
Okay, because if one, like the second one here is dependent on the first one, there's no pivot position in column two.

4192
05:52:30,000 --> 05:52:36,000
Column four is dependent on the first and the third, there's no pivot position in column four.

4193
05:52:36,000 --> 05:52:48,000
So the pivot columns indicate which columns are, indicate the columns that are linearly, that should be independent.

4194
05:52:48,000 --> 05:52:53,000
Pivot columns indicate the columns that are linearly independent.

4195
05:52:53,000 --> 05:52:57,000
Okay, so those are the ones we want to keep.

4196
05:52:57,000 --> 05:53:05,000
We have a theorem that says that the pivot columns form a basis for the column space of A.

4197
05:53:05,000 --> 05:53:14,000
All right, now along with this comes a warning, which is to be careful to use the pivot columns of A.

4198
05:53:14,000 --> 05:53:20,000
That is the original matrix, not some echelon or reduced echelon form of A.

4199
05:53:20,000 --> 05:53:28,000
And that's because elementary row operations can change the column space of a matrix.

4200
05:53:28,000 --> 05:53:32,000
Okay, so we go back and look at that one example one more time.

4201
05:53:32,000 --> 05:53:43,000
The column space of A, that is all linear combinations of the columns of A, is not the same as a set of all linear combinations of the columns of B.

4202
05:53:43,000 --> 05:53:45,000
Those are not the same.

4203
05:53:45,000 --> 05:53:52,000
And so the column spaces are not the same.

4204
05:53:52,000 --> 05:53:58,000
For example, the first column of A is clearly in the column space of A.

4205
05:53:58,000 --> 05:54:02,000
One times first column, zero times the others, and that's what you get.

4206
05:54:02,000 --> 05:54:06,000
But that column is not in the column space of B.

4207
05:54:06,000 --> 05:54:07,000
Why?

4208
05:54:07,000 --> 05:54:17,000
Well, when we set up the system, we've got this right hand side, notice system's inconsistent, because we've got all zeros and then something not zero.

4209
05:54:17,000 --> 05:54:20,000
Okay, it's not in the column space.

4210
05:54:20,000 --> 05:54:22,000
So the column spaces are different.

4211
05:54:22,000 --> 05:54:30,000
Therefore, you can't take the pivot columns from B and say that that's a basis for the column space of A.

4212
05:54:30,000 --> 05:54:43,000
You need to look in your echelon form or your reduced echelon form, see which ones are the pivot columns, and then go back and pull those from the original matrix.

4213
05:54:43,000 --> 05:54:45,000
Alright, here's another example.

4214
05:54:45,000 --> 05:54:50,000
Here's a matrix and you're asked to find a basis for the column space of this matrix.

4215
05:54:50,000 --> 05:55:00,000
So we put it in echelon form, get this matrix, and notice we've got pivot column in a pivot position in the first column, third column, and the fifth column.

4216
05:55:00,000 --> 05:55:10,000
So therefore, we go back and take the first, third, and fifth columns of A for a basis for the column space of A.

4217
05:55:10,000 --> 05:55:12,000
Okay, and here's a little different question.

4218
05:55:12,000 --> 05:55:17,000
Same matrix, you're asked to find a basis for the null space of A.

4219
05:55:17,000 --> 05:55:22,000
Alright, remember the null space, set of all solutions to AX equals zero.

4220
05:55:22,000 --> 05:55:25,000
So let's solve AX equals zero.

4221
05:55:25,000 --> 05:55:28,000
Get the same matrix here.

4222
05:55:28,000 --> 05:55:32,000
We look at the general form of the solution.

4223
05:55:32,000 --> 05:55:38,000
From the first row, we get X1 is going to be negative 2X2 minus 4X4.

4224
05:55:38,000 --> 05:55:43,000
X3 is going to be 7 fifths, X4.

4225
05:55:43,000 --> 05:55:47,000
And from the third row, we get X5 is just equal to zero.

4226
05:55:47,000 --> 05:55:50,000
X2 and X4 are free variables.

4227
05:55:50,000 --> 05:55:56,000
So if we put that in parametric vector form, we get what's given here.

4228
05:55:56,000 --> 05:56:03,000
And so any vector in the null space of A can be written as a linear combination of these two vectors.

4229
05:56:03,000 --> 05:56:08,000
Alright, so that means that they span the null space of A.

4230
05:56:08,000 --> 05:56:11,000
So we're halfway to being a basis.

4231
05:56:11,000 --> 05:56:22,000
Still need to show that they are linearly independent or reduce the set so that we get a linearly independent set.

4232
05:56:22,000 --> 05:56:27,000
So the question is, we know that they span, are they linearly independent?

4233
05:56:27,000 --> 05:56:33,000
And if you just look at them, it's clear that they are because you've got two vectors that are not multiples of each other.

4234
05:56:33,000 --> 05:56:36,000
So they must be linearly independent.

4235
05:56:36,000 --> 05:56:42,000
So these two vectors will be a basis for the null space of A.

4236
05:56:42,000 --> 05:56:51,000
Now, an important point is that in general, when you solve AX equals zero and write your solution in parametric vector form,

4237
05:56:51,000 --> 05:56:56,000
the vectors that you get will always be linearly independent.

4238
05:56:56,000 --> 05:57:00,000
So in fact, when you write that solution in parametric vector form,

4239
05:57:00,000 --> 05:57:07,000
you've got a set of vectors that spans and they will be linearly independent.

4240
05:57:07,000 --> 05:57:10,000
Now, why are they linearly independent?

4241
05:57:10,000 --> 05:57:17,000
Because the only way to produce the zero vector is to set each of the free variables equal to zero.

4242
05:57:17,000 --> 05:57:20,000
So if you go back and look at the one we were just looking at,

4243
05:57:20,000 --> 05:57:26,000
if you didn't know, if you can just look at that and tell that they're not multiples of each other,

4244
05:57:26,000 --> 05:57:29,000
so they're linearly independent, if you tried to solve the system,

4245
05:57:29,000 --> 05:57:40,000
then notice that in the second component, you've got X2 plus zero would equal zero.

4246
05:57:40,000 --> 05:57:42,000
So X2 has to be zero.

4247
05:57:42,000 --> 05:57:46,000
And X4 times one equals zero means X4 has to be zero.

4248
05:57:46,000 --> 05:57:57,000
Because of the way these vectors are produced, you always end up with the element that corresponds to the free variable.

4249
05:57:57,000 --> 05:58:01,000
So in this case, the second component, since this is multiplied by X2,

4250
05:58:01,000 --> 05:58:10,000
if you looked at that whole row, then the only solution would be set X2 equal to zero.

4251
05:58:10,000 --> 05:58:13,000
And similarly for X4, X4 has to be zero.

4252
05:58:14,000 --> 05:58:18,000
So when you write your solution in parametric vector form,

4253
05:58:18,000 --> 05:58:26,000
automatically you have a basis because they span and they're linearly independent.

4254
05:58:26,000 --> 05:58:30,000
Alright, one more example.

4255
05:58:30,000 --> 05:58:41,000
I've got three vectors here and we're given that V1 minus 3V2 plus 5V3 is equal to the zero vector.

4256
05:58:41,000 --> 05:58:45,000
And you're asked to find a basis for the span of these vectors.

4257
05:58:45,000 --> 05:58:52,000
So again, clearly you know that if you took all three, you have a set that spans.

4258
05:58:52,000 --> 05:58:56,000
But we know from what we're given that they're not linearly independent.

4259
05:58:56,000 --> 05:59:02,000
So we need to figure out which vectors to throw out until we get to a linearly independent set.

4260
05:59:02,000 --> 05:59:08,000
And since we can write any of the three as a linear combination of the other two,

4261
05:59:08,000 --> 05:59:15,000
simply solve this equation for any of the three vectors, then we could throw any of them out.

4262
05:59:15,000 --> 05:59:25,000
But it's kind of a convention to throw out the first one that's linearly dependent, which would be V3.

4263
05:59:25,000 --> 05:59:28,000
And so we're left with V1 and V2.

4264
05:59:28,000 --> 05:59:33,000
And if we just look at those, we can see that they're not multiples of each other.

4265
05:59:33,000 --> 05:59:37,000
And so therefore the set V1 and V2 is linearly independent.

4266
05:59:37,000 --> 05:59:46,000
It still spans and therefore it's a basis for W.

4267
05:59:46,000 --> 05:59:55,000
Okay, today we're going to talk about using a basis as a coordinate system for a vector space.

4268
05:59:55,000 --> 05:59:59,000
We start off with the unique representation theorem.

4269
05:59:59,000 --> 06:00:07,000
And it says, suppose you have a basis B, which consists of the vectors B1 through Bn.

4270
06:00:07,000 --> 06:00:13,000
And you choose some x from the vector space V.

4271
06:00:13,000 --> 06:00:23,000
And the theorem says that no matter which x you pick from the vector space, there are a unique set of scalars,

4272
06:00:23,000 --> 06:00:32,000
C1 through Cn that you can use to take a linear combination of the vectors in your basis to produce x.

4273
06:00:32,000 --> 06:00:35,000
Okay, now, so it's really saying two things.

4274
06:00:35,000 --> 06:00:37,000
It's saying that that system's consistent.

4275
06:00:37,000 --> 06:00:43,000
Take a linear combination of the B's and you can produce any vector in the vector space.

4276
06:00:43,000 --> 06:00:48,000
And it's also saying that the solution to that system is unique.

4277
06:00:48,000 --> 06:00:55,000
And both these things follow from the fact that B is a basis for V.

4278
06:00:55,000 --> 06:01:02,000
The fact that it's a basis tells you that these vectors span V.

4279
06:01:02,000 --> 06:01:07,000
So therefore that system is going to have a solution no matter what x is.

4280
06:01:07,000 --> 06:01:11,000
And it also tells you that these vectors are linearly independent.

4281
06:01:11,000 --> 06:01:15,000
And since they're linearly independent, the solution to that system will be unique.

4282
06:01:15,000 --> 06:01:19,000
Since there's no free variables.

4283
06:01:19,000 --> 06:01:31,000
Okay, now the weights that we use, these C values, are called the coordinates of x relative to the basis B.

4284
06:01:31,000 --> 06:01:39,000
Okay, and we write them using your book's notation as x with the brackets around it.

4285
06:01:39,000 --> 06:01:44,000
This notation here with the subscript B.

4286
06:01:44,000 --> 06:01:53,000
And we call that the coordinate vector of x relative to the basis B.

4287
06:01:53,000 --> 06:01:59,000
Alright, so for example, we have a basis for R2 here.

4288
06:01:59,000 --> 06:02:02,000
The vectors 1, 2, 3, 4.

4289
06:02:02,000 --> 06:02:07,000
Just a quick aside, how do we know that that's a basis for R2?

4290
06:02:07,000 --> 06:02:12,000
Well, the simplest way is to say, well, we know the dimension of R2 is 2.

4291
06:02:12,000 --> 06:02:16,000
And here we have a set with two vectors that are linearly independent.

4292
06:02:16,000 --> 06:02:21,000
And we know they're linearly independent because there's two vectors and neither's a multiple of the other.

4293
06:02:21,000 --> 06:02:33,000
Alright, so my question is, based on this particular basis, can you find the coordinates of the vector 0 or 1, 0 relative to this basis?

4294
06:02:33,000 --> 06:02:38,000
So I'm just setting up the system that we talked about previously.

4295
06:02:38,000 --> 06:02:43,000
I need to take a linear combination of the vectors and the basis to produce x.

4296
06:02:43,000 --> 06:02:50,000
And so we can set up that system in an augmented matrix and solve the system.

4297
06:02:50,000 --> 06:02:57,000
And this tells us that the numbers we're looking for are negative 2 and 1.

4298
06:02:57,000 --> 06:03:02,000
Just a quick check. We multiply negative 2 times the first vector plus 1 times the second vector.

4299
06:03:02,000 --> 06:03:06,000
That gives us 1, 0, which is what we were looking for.

4300
06:03:06,000 --> 06:03:17,000
So that tells us that the coordinate vector of x relative to B, which we write in this notation, is negative 2, 1.

4301
06:03:17,000 --> 06:03:19,000
Alright, suppose we go the other way.

4302
06:03:19,000 --> 06:03:25,000
Suppose you're given the coordinate vector and you want to find the corresponding vector.

4303
06:03:25,000 --> 06:03:30,000
So in this case, all you need to do is compute that linear combination.

4304
06:03:30,000 --> 06:03:31,000
You have the coordinates.

4305
06:03:31,000 --> 06:03:36,000
So in this case, it's 5 times the first vector plus 10 times the second.

4306
06:03:36,000 --> 06:03:42,000
And we compute that to be 3550.

4307
06:03:42,000 --> 06:03:52,000
Okay, this is a little bit of an aside, but kind of leads us into what we're going to talk about next.

4308
06:03:52,000 --> 06:04:05,000
If you have any vector, say just AB, then the vector itself is the coordinate vector relative to the standard basis.

4309
06:04:05,000 --> 06:04:09,000
So let's refresh our memory about what the standard basis is.

4310
06:04:09,000 --> 06:04:16,000
That's just for R2, just the two columns of the identity matrix.

4311
06:04:16,000 --> 06:04:24,000
Now your book refers to that as the labels that set with a script E.

4312
06:04:24,000 --> 06:04:33,000
Alright, so notice that if you've got a vector AB, then that's just A times 1, 0 plus B times 0, 1.

4313
06:04:33,000 --> 06:04:36,000
So your coordinates are A and B.

4314
06:04:36,000 --> 06:04:41,000
So therefore the coordinate vector is just equal to the vector itself, which is just AB.

4315
06:04:41,000 --> 06:04:52,000
So relative to the standard basis, the entries in a vector are actually the entries in the coordinate vector.

4316
06:04:52,000 --> 06:04:56,000
Okay, so just a little review.

4317
06:04:56,000 --> 06:05:04,000
If we have a basis and a coordinate vector, how do we find the corresponding vector?

4318
06:05:04,000 --> 06:05:08,000
Well, we just compute that linear combination.

4319
06:05:08,000 --> 06:05:17,000
Alright, so we know that this linear combination can be written in as a matrix times a vector.

4320
06:05:17,000 --> 06:05:26,000
And so if we define this matrix, we'll call it piece of B to be the matrix consisting of the vectors and the basis.

4321
06:05:26,000 --> 06:05:33,000
Then this linear combination can be written as piece of B times the coordinate vector.

4322
06:05:39,000 --> 06:05:49,000
And we say that piece of B is the change of coordinates matrix from B to the standard basis of our N.

4323
06:05:49,000 --> 06:05:58,000
Alright, so we're taking piece of B, multiplying it by the coordinate vector relative to B,

4324
06:05:58,000 --> 06:06:06,000
and we end up with the coordinate vector relative to the standard basis, which as we saw before is just the vector itself.

4325
06:06:07,000 --> 06:06:13,000
Alright, so let's talk about how we go back the other way.

4326
06:06:13,000 --> 06:06:17,000
For given a basis and a vector, how do we find its coordinate vector?

4327
06:06:17,000 --> 06:06:27,000
Well, we need to solve a system, right?

4328
06:06:27,000 --> 06:06:31,000
Take the linear combination, set it equal to the vector, and solve the system.

4329
06:06:31,000 --> 06:06:34,000
We need to figure out what those multipliers need to be.

4330
06:06:34,000 --> 06:06:43,000
So looking at it in matrix terms, we have this relationship, but we don't know what the coordinate vector is.

4331
06:06:43,000 --> 06:06:46,000
So therefore we need to solve the system for the coordinate vector.

4332
06:06:46,000 --> 06:06:58,000
And one way to do that is to multiply both sides by the inverse of the matrix, and that'll give us the coordinate vector.

4333
06:06:58,000 --> 06:07:05,000
Now, the danger there is, well, how do we know that matrix is invertible?

4334
06:07:05,000 --> 06:07:14,000
Well, we actually do know that it's invertible because we know that its columns are a basis for our N.

4335
06:07:14,000 --> 06:07:25,000
And so that's actually straight out of the invertible matrix theorem, but you can kind of get there in a couple of steps

4336
06:07:25,000 --> 06:07:31,000
if you think, well, columns are a basis for our N, so that means that the columns must be linearly independent,

4337
06:07:31,000 --> 06:07:36,000
which means there's a pivot position in every column, therefore N pivot positions.

4338
06:07:36,000 --> 06:07:41,000
So the matrix is invertible.

4339
06:07:41,000 --> 06:07:46,000
Okay, so we're going to put those two ideas together in this question.

4340
06:07:46,000 --> 06:07:50,000
So here I've got two bases for R2.

4341
06:07:50,000 --> 06:07:55,000
Well, bases, that's the plural of bases.

4342
06:07:55,000 --> 06:08:00,000
If you've seen that kind of confusing, but bases is just the plural of bases.

4343
06:08:00,000 --> 06:08:05,000
So we have two bases for R2 here, we call them B and C.

4344
06:08:05,000 --> 06:08:12,000
And I have a coordinate vector for a vector x relative to basis B.

4345
06:08:12,000 --> 06:08:16,000
Alright, so coordinate vector of x relative to B, which is this vector here.

4346
06:08:16,000 --> 06:08:22,000
And I want to know how do we find the coordinate vector of x relative to C?

4347
06:08:22,000 --> 06:08:29,000
Well, you can think of it probably easiest as a two-step process.

4348
06:08:29,000 --> 06:08:37,000
So first, use the coordinate vector relative to B to find actually what x is.

4349
06:08:37,000 --> 06:08:42,000
And once you know what x is, then you can find the coordinate vector of x relative to C.

4350
06:08:42,000 --> 06:08:44,000
Alright, so we'll do those two steps.

4351
06:08:44,000 --> 06:08:53,000
So the first one here, to find x, we just multiply our piece of B matrix,

4352
06:08:53,000 --> 06:08:58,000
the matrix consisting of the vectors in B times our coordinate vector,

4353
06:08:58,000 --> 06:09:02,000
and we find that x is 244.

4354
06:09:02,000 --> 06:09:08,000
And once we know that, then we just need to take a linear combination of the vectors in C

4355
06:09:08,000 --> 06:09:13,000
and set that equal to 244 and solve that system.

4356
06:09:13,000 --> 06:09:22,000
Okay, or look at it like this, where we solve the system by taking the inverse of that matrix times x.

4357
06:09:22,000 --> 06:09:26,000
So here's a piece of C.

4358
06:09:26,000 --> 06:09:29,000
These are just the columns that are in the basis C.

4359
06:09:29,000 --> 06:09:33,000
We invert that matrix, multiply by 244.

4360
06:09:33,000 --> 06:09:41,000
So what we have here, I'm taking one over the determinant times this matrix times 244,

4361
06:09:41,000 --> 06:09:44,000
and I end up with a vector of 4, 2.

4362
06:09:44,000 --> 06:09:48,000
So this is coordinate vector of x relative to C.

4363
06:09:48,000 --> 06:09:55,000
Now just to check, we can take that, these coordinates, times our vectors in C,

4364
06:09:55,000 --> 06:10:00,000
and see if we get x, which we do, 244.

4365
06:10:00,000 --> 06:10:04,000
So let's go back and take a look at what we did.

4366
06:10:04,000 --> 06:10:10,000
First step was to compute x, which we did by piece of B times x of B,

4367
06:10:10,000 --> 06:10:18,000
and then compute the coordinate vector relative to C by piece of C inverse times x.

4368
06:10:18,000 --> 06:10:23,000
Now we can't put that all together, just plug in for x,

4369
06:10:23,000 --> 06:10:31,000
and we have the coordinate vector of x relative to C is just PC inverse times piece of B times coordinate vector relative to B.

4370
06:10:31,000 --> 06:10:38,000
And so what we have is a change of coordinates matrix from B to C.

4371
06:10:38,000 --> 06:10:44,000
So this matrix takes us from coordinates in B to coordinates in C.

4372
06:10:44,000 --> 06:10:55,000
So PC inverse times piece of B is how we can change B coordinates to C coordinates.

4373
06:10:55,000 --> 06:11:01,000
Alright, we're going to switch gears just a little bit and talk about polynomials.

4374
06:11:01,000 --> 06:11:04,000
Let's examine this problem.

4375
06:11:04,000 --> 06:11:09,000
I want to show that these polynomials are a basis for piece of 3.

4376
06:11:09,000 --> 06:11:18,000
Okay, this is actually a homework problem from section 4.5, I think.

4377
06:11:18,000 --> 06:11:22,000
Okay, so to show that these are a basis for piece of 3,

4378
06:11:22,000 --> 06:11:27,000
we need to show that they span piece of 3 and that they're linearly independent.

4379
06:11:27,000 --> 06:11:31,000
So let's start off and show that they're linearly independent.

4380
06:11:31,000 --> 06:11:38,000
So to show any sets linearly independent, we have to take a linear combination and set it equal to the zero vector.

4381
06:11:38,000 --> 06:11:42,000
Or in this case, the zero element of piece of 3.

4382
06:11:42,000 --> 06:11:44,000
So here's a linear combination.

4383
06:11:44,000 --> 06:11:49,000
Alright, C sub 1 times the first element, C sub 2 times the second one, so forth.

4384
06:11:49,000 --> 06:11:54,000
Equals, here's the zero element of piece of 3.

4385
06:11:54,000 --> 06:12:00,000
Zero plus zero times t plus zero times t squared plus zero times t cubed.

4386
06:12:00,000 --> 06:12:09,000
Alright, and we want to be able to show that the only solution to this system is that all the C's have to be zero.

4387
06:12:09,000 --> 06:12:17,000
So the way to approach that is to collect like terms, collect all the constant terms,

4388
06:12:17,000 --> 06:12:26,000
collect all the coefficients of t and so forth, and then equate those coefficients to what we have on the right-hand side.

4389
06:12:26,000 --> 06:12:32,000
So we do that, we end up with this, so this comes from, we've got C1 here,

4390
06:12:32,000 --> 06:12:38,000
and then from this term we get a 2 times C3, so that's our constant term.

4391
06:12:38,000 --> 06:12:49,000
Coefficient of t here, we've got a 2 times C2 from here, and over here a negative 12 times C4, so that's where that comes from.

4392
06:12:49,000 --> 06:12:57,000
For t squared I've got 4 times C sub 3, and for t cubed I've got an 8 times C sub 4.

4393
06:12:57,000 --> 06:13:02,000
Alright, so those are equal to this zero vector again.

4394
06:13:02,000 --> 06:13:11,000
Now, if you write out that system of equations, right, we're going to get C sub 1 minus 2C3 equals zero.

4395
06:13:11,000 --> 06:13:19,000
2C2 minus 12C4 has to be zero, and 4C3 has to be zero, and 8C4 has to be zero.

4396
06:13:19,000 --> 06:13:27,000
So if you write that out, it looks like this, and when you look at it like that, it's obvious that all the C's have to be zero.

4397
06:13:27,000 --> 06:13:30,000
Alright, from the last equation you get C4 has to be zero.

4398
06:13:30,000 --> 06:13:40,000
From this one we get C sub 3 has to be zero, and since both C3 and C4 are zero, then that means that C1 and C2 have to be zero.

4399
06:13:40,000 --> 06:13:47,000
Alright, so we've shown here that the polynomials are linearly independent.

4400
06:13:47,000 --> 06:13:51,000
Let's just look at it in matrix form.

4401
06:13:51,000 --> 06:13:58,000
If we just look at the coefficients, it's already in echelon form, and we have a pivot position in every row.

4402
06:13:58,000 --> 06:14:07,000
So from that we know that these polynomials must span piece of three, so no matter what the right-hand side is, there'll be a solution.

4403
06:14:07,000 --> 06:14:13,000
Alright, so we have that they're linearly independent, and they span piece of three, so they have to be a basis for piece of three.

4404
06:14:13,000 --> 06:14:26,000
Now there's actually a somewhat easier way to look at this, and that is to look at the polynomials and what we ended up with in the columns of this matrix.

4405
06:14:26,000 --> 06:14:41,000
Now, actually the way it works is a polynomial of this form, here's a degree three polynomial, actually has a one-to-one correspondence with the vector in R4 that looks like this.

4406
06:14:41,000 --> 06:14:48,000
First comes the constant term, then the coefficient of t, coefficient of t squared, and coefficient of t cubed.

4407
06:14:48,000 --> 06:14:57,000
So for example, our polynomial, one of them was just one, so that corresponds to the vector 1, 0, 0, 0 in R4.

4408
06:14:57,000 --> 06:15:03,000
And if you look, that's what the first column of this matrix, our coefficient matrix was.

4409
06:15:03,000 --> 06:15:08,000
And then just pick another one, how about the last one, negative 12t plus 8t cubed.

4410
06:15:08,000 --> 06:15:18,000
Alright, then that's going to have, that's 0 for the constant term, negative 12 for the coefficient of t, 0 coefficient of t squared, and 8 for the coefficient of t cubed.

4411
06:15:18,000 --> 06:15:23,000
And that's what the last column in our coefficient matrix looks like.

4412
06:15:23,000 --> 06:15:31,000
So the bottom line is that every polynomial in piece of n can be represented as a vector in Rn plus 1.

4413
06:15:31,000 --> 06:15:44,000
So there's a one-to-one correspondence between polynomials in piece of n and vectors in Rn plus 1.

4414
06:15:44,000 --> 06:15:49,000
Alright, let's talk about the dimension of a vector space.

4415
06:15:49,000 --> 06:15:54,000
To do this, we need to go back and review what a basis is.

4416
06:15:54,000 --> 06:16:06,000
We call that a basis is a set of vectors that is linearly independent and spans the subspace that it's a basis for.

4417
06:16:06,000 --> 06:16:10,000
So let's think about R3.

4418
06:16:10,000 --> 06:16:17,000
If you have more than three vectors in R3, then they must be linearly dependent.

4419
06:16:17,000 --> 06:16:23,000
Put them in a matrix, put it in an echelon form, then you would have free variables.

4420
06:16:23,000 --> 06:16:27,000
If you have less than three vectors, then they don't span R3.

4421
06:16:27,000 --> 06:16:34,000
Alright, if you had only two, you wouldn't be able to have a pivot position in every column if you stuck them in a matrix.

4422
06:16:34,000 --> 06:16:39,000
So, or wouldn't have a pivot position in every row, excuse me.

4423
06:16:39,000 --> 06:16:45,000
So they would not be, they would not span R3.

4424
06:16:45,000 --> 06:16:49,000
So put those two together.

4425
06:16:49,000 --> 06:16:55,000
You need at least three to span.

4426
06:16:55,000 --> 06:16:58,000
If you have more than three, they're linearly dependent.

4427
06:16:58,000 --> 06:17:05,000
So that means that any basis for R3 has to have exactly three vectors.

4428
06:17:05,000 --> 06:17:16,000
Alright, our theorem says that if a vector space has a basis of n vectors, then every basis for that space must have exactly n vectors.

4429
06:17:16,000 --> 06:17:28,000
This number of vectors in a basis for a vector space is called the dimension of that vector space.

4430
06:17:28,000 --> 06:17:37,000
And we have a special case where the vector space has only the zero element.

4431
06:17:37,000 --> 06:17:39,000
Okay, we call that the zero vector space.

4432
06:17:39,000 --> 06:17:49,000
And since there's no basis for that set, then we define its dimension to be zero.

4433
06:17:49,000 --> 06:17:57,000
Okay, so to find the dimension of a vector space or subspace, then one approach is simply to find a basis for that space.

4434
06:17:57,000 --> 06:18:03,000
And count the number of vectors in that basis.

4435
06:18:03,000 --> 06:18:09,000
The standard basis for Rn consists of the vectors e1 through en.

4436
06:18:09,000 --> 06:18:19,000
So you might recall that e sub i is the vector in Rn that has a one in the i-th position and zeroes out everywhere else.

4437
06:18:19,000 --> 06:18:26,000
Or you can think of e sub i as just the i-th column of the identity matrix.

4438
06:18:26,000 --> 06:18:36,000
So the standard basis for R3 consists of these three vectors, which you'll recognize as the columns of the three by three identity matrix.

4439
06:18:36,000 --> 06:18:41,000
In general, the dimension of Rn is n.

4440
06:18:41,000 --> 06:18:44,000
Alright, let's talk about polynomials.

4441
06:18:44,000 --> 06:18:50,000
P sub n, if you recall, is the set of polynomials of degree n or less.

4442
06:18:50,000 --> 06:18:59,000
So for example, P sub 2 consists of all polynomials that are quadratic or less.

4443
06:18:59,000 --> 06:19:08,000
Okay, all polynomials that look like a naught plus a1 times t plus a2 times t squared, where the a values are just real numbers.

4444
06:19:08,000 --> 06:19:17,000
The standard basis for P sub 2 is this set, 1, t, and t squared.

4445
06:19:17,000 --> 06:19:27,000
So any vector in P sub 2, any polynomial in P sub 2 can be written as a linear combination of these three objects.

4446
06:19:27,000 --> 06:19:30,000
So the dimension of P sub 2 is 3.

4447
06:19:30,000 --> 06:19:36,000
And in general, the dimension of P sub n is n plus 1.

4448
06:19:36,000 --> 06:19:44,000
Okay, what if we have a set like this defined in terms of these parameters?

4449
06:19:44,000 --> 06:19:49,000
How do we find the dimension of such a set?

4450
06:19:49,000 --> 06:19:53,000
Well, first let's find a basis.

4451
06:19:53,000 --> 06:19:59,000
And to do that, we can write this generic vector in parametric vector form.

4452
06:19:59,000 --> 06:20:05,000
And so at this point, we know that these three vectors span our set S.

4453
06:20:06,000 --> 06:20:11,000
So we want to know, are they linearly independent?

4454
06:20:11,000 --> 06:20:14,000
And to check, see if they're linearly independent, we throw them in a matrix.

4455
06:20:14,000 --> 06:20:16,000
These are row operations.

4456
06:20:16,000 --> 06:20:21,000
Get that in echelon or reduced echelon form.

4457
06:20:21,000 --> 06:20:24,000
I got it in reduced echelon form.

4458
06:20:24,000 --> 06:20:29,000
And we can see here, there's not a pivot position in every column.

4459
06:20:29,000 --> 06:20:33,000
Therefore, they're not linearly independent.

4460
06:20:33,000 --> 06:20:37,000
We can see that there's a pivot position in the first two columns.

4461
06:20:37,000 --> 06:20:41,000
So that means that the first two vectors are linearly independent.

4462
06:20:41,000 --> 06:20:50,000
And notice that the negative one-third here means that the third column is minus one-third of the first column.

4463
06:20:50,000 --> 06:20:53,000
And if you look back, that is true.

4464
06:20:53,000 --> 06:20:56,000
Minus one-third of three is negative one.

4465
06:20:56,000 --> 06:21:01,000
Minus one-third of six is negative two and so forth.

4466
06:21:01,000 --> 06:21:03,000
All right.

4467
06:21:03,000 --> 06:21:07,000
So that means that we can throw out that third column.

4468
06:21:07,000 --> 06:21:11,000
And a basis for S would just consist of the first two vectors.

4469
06:21:11,000 --> 06:21:17,000
And once we have a basis, then we need to only count the vectors in the basis to get the dimension.

4470
06:21:17,000 --> 06:21:19,000
So there's two vectors in the basis.

4471
06:21:19,000 --> 06:21:21,000
That means the dimension of S is two.

4472
06:21:21,000 --> 06:21:33,000
And we don't say that S is R2, because it's not, because these vectors are in R4.

4473
06:21:33,000 --> 06:21:39,000
But what we do say is that S is a two-dimensional subspace of R4.

4474
06:21:39,000 --> 06:21:43,000
All right.

4475
06:21:43,000 --> 06:21:45,000
The basis theorem, this is an important theorem.

4476
06:21:45,000 --> 06:21:54,000
It says that if you have a vector space with dimension P, where P is greater than or equal to one, then the following conditions hold.

4477
06:21:54,000 --> 06:22:02,000
Number one, any linearly independent set of P elements in V is a basis for V.

4478
06:22:02,000 --> 06:22:03,000
Automatically.

4479
06:22:03,000 --> 06:22:05,000
Don't have to check to see if it spans.

4480
06:22:05,000 --> 06:22:12,000
Similarly, any set of P elements that spans V is automatically a basis.

4481
06:22:12,000 --> 06:22:18,000
Don't have to check to see if it's linearly independent.

4482
06:22:18,000 --> 06:22:26,000
Since we know the dimension of R3 is three, if you have a set of three vectors in R3 that are linearly independent, then you know they're a basis.

4483
06:22:26,000 --> 06:22:30,000
You don't have to check to see if they span, because they will.

4484
06:22:30,000 --> 06:22:36,000
Similarly, if you have a set of three vectors that span R3, then you know they're a basis for R3.

4485
06:22:36,000 --> 06:22:41,000
You don't have to check to see if they're linearly independent, because they will be.

4486
06:22:41,000 --> 06:22:47,000
So we basically end up with three pieces of the puzzle.

4487
06:22:47,000 --> 06:22:49,000
Let's go back to that.

4488
06:22:49,000 --> 06:22:59,000
Three pieces of the puzzle, knowing the dimension, having a set of that many vectors that spans, or having a set of that many vectors that's linearly independent.

4489
06:22:59,000 --> 06:23:10,000
If you have any two of those three pieces, then you can conclude that you have a basis for the vector space you're dealing with.

4490
06:23:10,000 --> 06:23:13,000
Okay.

4491
06:23:13,000 --> 06:23:18,000
For giving a matrix A, how do we find the dimension of the column space of A?

4492
06:23:18,000 --> 06:23:25,000
Well, we go back to our method, find a basis, and count the number of vectors in the basis.

4493
06:23:25,000 --> 06:23:31,000
Now let's think back, how do we find a basis for the column space of a matrix?

4494
06:23:31,000 --> 06:23:36,000
We will put A in echelon form so that we can find the pivot columns.

4495
06:23:36,000 --> 06:23:44,000
We pull those columns from A, not from the echelon form, but from the original matrix A, and that's our basis.

4496
06:23:44,000 --> 06:23:49,000
So here's one I think we looked at this one last time.

4497
06:23:49,000 --> 06:23:53,000
We take the matrix A, put it in echelon form.

4498
06:23:53,000 --> 06:24:03,000
We can see that the first, third, and fifth columns are pivot columns, so we pull the first, third, and fifth columns from A, and that's a basis for the column space of A.

4499
06:24:03,000 --> 06:24:13,000
And once you have a basis, then getting the dimensions trivial, three vectors in the basis, so the dimension of the column space of A is three.

4500
06:24:13,000 --> 06:24:23,000
In general, the dimension of the column space of a matrix is simply equal to the number of pivot columns in the matrix.

4501
06:24:23,000 --> 06:24:24,000
Alright, how about the null space?

4502
06:24:24,000 --> 06:24:30,000
We have a matrix A, how do we find the dimension of the null space of A?

4503
06:24:30,000 --> 06:24:34,000
Well, once again, find a basis and then count the number of vectors.

4504
06:24:34,000 --> 06:24:41,000
So let's think back, how do we find a basis for the null space of a matrix?

4505
06:24:41,000 --> 06:24:47,000
Well, we have to solve AX equals zero and write the solution in parametric vector form.

4506
06:24:47,000 --> 06:24:55,000
And the vectors that we get there both span the null space of A and they're linearly independent.

4507
06:24:55,000 --> 06:25:06,000
We made that argument last time that when you write those in parametric vector form, they will be linearly independent and therefore there'll be a basis for the null space of A.

4508
06:25:06,000 --> 06:25:19,000
So if we start with this matrix A, we solve AX equals zero and write the solution in parametric vector form.

4509
06:25:19,000 --> 06:25:38,000
So these two vectors are linearly independent, they span the null space, so there a basis for the null space.

4510
06:25:38,000 --> 06:25:44,000
Therefore the dimension of the null space for this particular matrix is two.

4511
06:25:44,000 --> 06:25:52,000
In general, the dimension of the null space is equal to the number of free variables in AX equals zero.

4512
06:25:52,000 --> 06:25:58,000
Because you have a vector here corresponding to each free variable.

4513
06:25:58,000 --> 06:26:01,000
And where do free variables come from?

4514
06:26:01,000 --> 06:26:04,000
They come from columns that don't have a pivot position.

4515
06:26:04,000 --> 06:26:10,000
So the dimension of the null space is equal to the number of non-pivot columns in A.

4516
06:26:10,000 --> 06:26:15,000
And recall the dimension of the column space is equal to the number of pivot columns.

4517
06:26:15,000 --> 06:26:19,000
Null space dimension is equal to the number of non-pivot columns.

4518
06:26:19,000 --> 06:26:27,000
So if we add those two quantities together, the dimension of the null space plus the dimension of the column space,

4519
06:26:27,000 --> 06:26:33,000
we get the number of pivot columns plus the number of non-pivot columns, which is equal to the number of columns.

4520
06:26:33,000 --> 06:26:38,000
And we'll hit on that some more next time.

4521
06:26:38,000 --> 06:26:44,380
Let's move on to talk about the rank of a matrix today.

4522
06:26:44,380 --> 06:26:46,820
Now first, a little bit of review.

4523
06:26:46,820 --> 06:26:50,480
Remember, the column space of a matrix

4524
06:26:50,480 --> 06:26:54,340
is the set of all linear combinations of the columns,

4525
06:26:54,340 --> 06:27:00,700
which is also the span of the set of columns of the matrix.

4526
06:27:00,700 --> 06:27:05,180
So we're going to talk about another subspace.

4527
06:27:05,180 --> 06:27:07,780
This time, the row space of a matrix.

4528
06:27:07,780 --> 06:27:09,740
So we know what the column space is,

4529
06:27:09,740 --> 06:27:13,660
so what do you think the row space of a matrix is?

4530
06:27:16,860 --> 06:27:22,180
Well, if you just take the analogous route,

4531
06:27:22,180 --> 06:27:26,060
then we get the row space of a matrix

4532
06:27:26,060 --> 06:27:29,020
is a set of all linear combinations of the rows

4533
06:27:29,020 --> 06:27:32,780
or the span of the set of rows of the matrix.

4534
06:27:32,780 --> 06:27:38,660
So it is truly just the analogous term to the column space.

4535
06:27:38,660 --> 06:27:41,820
We have the column space, all linear combinations of the columns,

4536
06:27:41,820 --> 06:27:46,220
row space, all linear combinations of the rows.

4537
06:27:46,220 --> 06:27:50,020
OK, so think back to find a basis for the column space

4538
06:27:50,020 --> 06:27:51,380
of a matrix.

4539
06:27:51,380 --> 06:27:53,260
We put the matrix initial on form

4540
06:27:53,260 --> 06:27:57,020
so that we can determine which columns are the pivot columns.

4541
06:27:57,020 --> 06:27:58,780
Then we go back to the original matrix

4542
06:27:58,780 --> 06:28:00,660
and pull out those columns, and that's

4543
06:28:00,660 --> 06:28:03,340
the basis for the column space of the original matrix.

4544
06:28:06,020 --> 06:28:08,460
So the question is, how do we find a basis for the row

4545
06:28:08,460 --> 06:28:10,020
space of a matrix?

4546
06:28:10,020 --> 06:28:13,180
And here, the similarities end somewhat,

4547
06:28:13,180 --> 06:28:16,620
although there still are some similarities.

4548
06:28:16,620 --> 06:28:20,180
But this theorem tells us how we can find a basis for the row

4549
06:28:20,180 --> 06:28:21,580
space of a matrix.

4550
06:28:21,580 --> 06:28:25,260
OK, so it says, if two matrices A and B are row equivalent,

4551
06:28:25,260 --> 06:28:27,840
so you can get from one to the other doing elementary row

4552
06:28:27,840 --> 06:28:32,280
operations, then their row spaces are the same.

4553
06:28:32,280 --> 06:28:36,480
Now you'll recall that that is not true for the column spaces.

4554
06:28:36,480 --> 06:28:38,680
When you do elementary row operations,

4555
06:28:38,680 --> 06:28:43,520
you may be changing the column space of the matrix.

4556
06:28:43,520 --> 06:28:46,400
But this theorem tells us that for row space,

4557
06:28:46,400 --> 06:28:50,200
that stays the same when you do row operations.

4558
06:28:50,200 --> 06:28:55,600
OK, if B is an echelon form, the non-zero rows of B

4559
06:28:55,600 --> 06:29:00,040
form a basis for the row space of A as well as for that of B.

4560
06:29:00,040 --> 06:29:04,200
So this tells us to find a basis for the row space of A.

4561
06:29:04,200 --> 06:29:09,040
We put it in echelon form and pull the non-zero rows

4562
06:29:09,040 --> 06:29:11,480
from that echelon form matrix.

4563
06:29:11,480 --> 06:29:15,840
And we have a basis for the row space of the original matrix

4564
06:29:15,840 --> 06:29:21,280
plus the echelon form matrix and any intermediate matrices

4565
06:29:21,280 --> 06:29:22,280
that we encountered.

4566
06:29:22,280 --> 06:29:32,200
OK, so again, elementary row operations do not change of this.

4567
06:29:32,200 --> 06:29:33,360
Back up here.

4568
06:29:33,360 --> 06:29:35,320
This is telling me that the linear dependence

4569
06:29:35,320 --> 06:29:37,280
relationships among the columns, OK?

4570
06:29:37,280 --> 06:29:39,480
So that means like if the second column of A

4571
06:29:39,480 --> 06:29:42,600
is 10 times the first column, then when

4572
06:29:42,600 --> 06:29:45,840
you do elementary row operations, that doesn't change.

4573
06:29:45,840 --> 06:29:47,680
So elementary row operations do not

4574
06:29:47,680 --> 06:29:50,040
change the linear dependence relationships

4575
06:29:50,080 --> 06:29:52,880
among the columns of a matrix.

4576
06:29:52,880 --> 06:29:56,360
However, they can change the linear dependence relationships

4577
06:29:56,360 --> 06:29:59,560
among the rows of a matrix.

4578
06:29:59,560 --> 06:30:02,480
OK, so let's look at a little simple example.

4579
06:30:02,480 --> 06:30:06,600
We start off with this matrix A. We do one row operation

4580
06:30:06,600 --> 06:30:10,640
and end up with this one, which I'll call B. Now, a basis

4581
06:30:10,640 --> 06:30:16,240
for the column space of A, we could just look at A

4582
06:30:16,240 --> 06:30:18,320
and say, well, I can see that the second column is

4583
06:30:18,320 --> 06:30:19,480
a multiple of the first.

4584
06:30:19,480 --> 06:30:22,280
So I throw it out and just keep the first column.

4585
06:30:22,280 --> 06:30:26,360
Or you could look at B and see where the pivot positions in B.

4586
06:30:26,360 --> 06:30:28,480
Well, there's only one in the first column.

4587
06:30:28,480 --> 06:30:32,520
So that means we want to pull the first column from A

4588
06:30:32,520 --> 06:30:38,120
to be a basis for the column space of A. If we want a basis

4589
06:30:38,120 --> 06:30:41,160
for the column space of B, that's straightforward

4590
06:30:41,160 --> 06:30:43,080
because B is already an echelon form.

4591
06:30:43,080 --> 06:30:46,160
So we know what the pivot columns are.

4592
06:30:46,160 --> 06:30:48,160
There's only one first column.

4593
06:30:48,160 --> 06:30:54,200
So that's a basis for the column space of B. So if we look

4594
06:30:54,200 --> 06:30:59,240
graphically at the column space of each of these matrices,

4595
06:30:59,240 --> 06:31:03,320
the red line here, you can see this vector right here.

4596
06:31:03,320 --> 06:31:04,680
This is 1, 1.

4597
06:31:04,680 --> 06:31:09,280
And so this red line is any multiple of the vector 1, 1.

4598
06:31:09,280 --> 06:31:14,720
So the red line is the column space of A. This vector here

4599
06:31:14,720 --> 06:31:16,600
is 1, 0.

4600
06:31:16,600 --> 06:31:19,720
And since that's a basis for the column space of B,

4601
06:31:19,720 --> 06:31:24,200
the blue line, or the x-axis, is the column space of B.

4602
06:31:24,200 --> 06:31:26,760
All multiples of 1, 0.

4603
06:31:26,760 --> 06:31:31,080
So clearly here, these column spaces are not the same.

4604
06:31:33,880 --> 06:31:35,480
These matrices are row equivalent,

4605
06:31:35,480 --> 06:31:37,600
but their column spaces are not the same.

4606
06:31:38,600 --> 06:31:44,600
All right, let's look again, same set of matrices.

4607
06:31:44,600 --> 06:31:47,960
Now, the row spaces are the same because we want a basis

4608
06:31:47,960 --> 06:31:53,200
for the row space of A. Then, right, we look at each row of A.

4609
06:31:53,200 --> 06:31:55,400
Well, they're the same row, right?

4610
06:31:55,400 --> 06:31:58,520
Each row is the same, and so we only need one of them.

4611
06:31:58,520 --> 06:32:01,040
Throw out the second one, and we keep the first row,

4612
06:32:01,040 --> 06:32:05,000
and that's a basis for the row space of A.

4613
06:32:05,080 --> 06:32:08,720
If we were using theorem, we would get A in echelon form,

4614
06:32:08,720 --> 06:32:12,120
which we have here, and take the non-zero rows of that matrix.

4615
06:32:12,120 --> 06:32:16,080
Well, the non-zero rows is just that row 1, 2.

4616
06:32:16,080 --> 06:32:19,120
So either way you look at it, you end up with this basis

4617
06:32:19,120 --> 06:32:25,120
for the row space of A. And similarly for the row space of B,

4618
06:32:25,120 --> 06:32:28,280
it's going to be all multiples of the row 1, 2,

4619
06:32:28,280 --> 06:32:32,080
because 0, 0 didn't add anything to the picture.

4620
06:32:32,080 --> 06:32:36,280
So this set, which consists of just that one row,

4621
06:32:36,280 --> 06:32:42,000
is a basis for both the row space of A and the row space of B.

4622
06:32:42,000 --> 06:32:47,480
Now, let's look at a little more interesting example.

4623
06:32:47,480 --> 06:32:51,480
There's a big matrix A, and after some row operations,

4624
06:32:51,480 --> 06:32:56,080
we end up with this version of A. This is an echelon form,

4625
06:32:56,080 --> 06:32:59,880
and we'll call that matrix B. So to get a basis

4626
06:32:59,880 --> 06:33:03,000
for the column space of A, we look at B,

4627
06:33:03,000 --> 06:33:06,120
we can see that there's a pivot position in the first column,

4628
06:33:06,120 --> 06:33:09,600
the second column, and the fourth column.

4629
06:33:09,600 --> 06:33:14,040
So we choose those columns out of A, first column,

4630
06:33:14,040 --> 06:33:16,240
second column, and the fourth column,

4631
06:33:16,240 --> 06:33:19,480
and that's a basis for the column space of A.

4632
06:33:19,480 --> 06:33:22,240
So the dimension of the column space of A

4633
06:33:22,240 --> 06:33:28,320
is the number of vectors in this basis, which is 3.

4634
06:33:28,320 --> 06:33:32,280
To get a basis for the column space of B, we look at B.

4635
06:33:32,280 --> 06:33:38,000
It's already an echelon form, so we choose the pivot columns,

4636
06:33:38,000 --> 06:33:41,480
and so we get the first, second, and fourth columns.

4637
06:33:41,480 --> 06:33:44,480
That's the basis for the column space of B.

4638
06:33:44,480 --> 06:33:47,080
And the dimension of the column space of B

4639
06:33:47,080 --> 06:33:48,760
counts the vectors in a basis.

4640
06:33:48,760 --> 06:33:50,120
That's 3.

4641
06:33:50,120 --> 06:33:55,680
So the dimension of the column space of B is 3.

4642
06:33:55,680 --> 06:33:58,720
All right, what about a basis for the row space of A,

4643
06:33:58,720 --> 06:34:00,040
in which we know from the theorem

4644
06:34:00,040 --> 06:34:03,000
will also be a basis for the row space of B?

4645
06:34:03,000 --> 06:34:05,520
Well, according to the theorem, put A in echelon form

4646
06:34:05,520 --> 06:34:07,840
and choose the non-zero rows.

4647
06:34:07,840 --> 06:34:11,640
So we do that, we get the first, second, and third rows of B,

4648
06:34:11,640 --> 06:34:14,840
which are given here.

4649
06:34:14,840 --> 06:34:17,760
So the dimension of the row space of A

4650
06:34:17,760 --> 06:34:19,880
is equal to the dimension of the row space of B,

4651
06:34:19,880 --> 06:34:23,000
and notice there's three vectors here, so that is 3.

4652
06:34:26,680 --> 06:34:29,680
All right, so we got the dimension of the column space of A

4653
06:34:29,680 --> 06:34:33,680
is 3, dimension of the row space of A is 3,

4654
06:34:33,680 --> 06:34:36,680
and the question is, is this a coincidence

4655
06:34:36,680 --> 06:34:39,680
that they're both the same value?

4656
06:34:39,680 --> 06:34:43,680
And if you think about that just a little bit,

4657
06:34:43,680 --> 06:34:46,680
you can say, no, I don't think so,

4658
06:34:46,680 --> 06:34:49,680
because the dimension of the column space of A

4659
06:34:49,680 --> 06:34:53,680
is the number of pivot columns or pivot positions in A,

4660
06:34:53,680 --> 06:34:56,680
and that's when we look at B to figure that out,

4661
06:34:56,680 --> 06:34:59,680
but there's three pivot positions,

4662
06:34:59,680 --> 06:35:02,680
and the dimension of the row space of A

4663
06:35:02,680 --> 06:35:04,680
is also equal to the number of pivot positions,

4664
06:35:04,680 --> 06:35:08,680
because there's a pivot position in each non-zero row

4665
06:35:08,680 --> 06:35:12,680
in B here, or in an echelon form of A.

4666
06:35:12,680 --> 06:35:16,680
So each of these values is based off

4667
06:35:16,680 --> 06:35:18,680
of the number of pivot positions, right,

4668
06:35:18,680 --> 06:35:21,680
because a pivot position defines a pivot column,

4669
06:35:21,680 --> 06:35:25,680
and a pivot position defines a non-zero row.

4670
06:35:25,680 --> 06:35:29,680
So for any matrix, the dimension of the column space

4671
06:35:29,680 --> 06:35:31,680
is equal to the dimension of the row space,

4672
06:35:31,680 --> 06:35:37,680
which is equal to the number of pivot positions in that matrix.

4673
06:35:37,680 --> 06:35:43,680
Okay, and this quantity is what we call the rank of a matrix.

4674
06:35:43,680 --> 06:35:47,680
The rank of a matrix is the dimension of the column space,

4675
06:35:47,680 --> 06:35:50,680
which is also equal to the dimension of the row space

4676
06:35:50,680 --> 06:35:52,680
of that matrix.

4677
06:35:52,680 --> 06:35:57,680
Okay, as we just called that, the rank of the matrix.

4678
06:35:57,680 --> 06:35:59,680
All right, back to this one.

4679
06:35:59,680 --> 06:36:01,680
Let's talk about the null space.

4680
06:36:01,680 --> 06:36:04,680
What is the dimension of the null space of A?

4681
06:36:04,680 --> 06:36:10,680
Well, we end up with a...

4682
06:36:10,680 --> 06:36:14,680
We want to find a basis for the null space, right?

4683
06:36:14,680 --> 06:36:17,680
We solve AX equals zero

4684
06:36:17,680 --> 06:36:20,680
and write our solution in parametric vector form,

4685
06:36:20,680 --> 06:36:24,680
and those vectors will be a basis for the null space of A.

4686
06:36:24,680 --> 06:36:28,680
Now, how many vectors do you end up with in that case?

4687
06:36:28,680 --> 06:36:31,680
Well, you end up with one for each free variable.

4688
06:36:31,680 --> 06:36:35,680
Okay, the key is one for each free variable.

4689
06:36:35,680 --> 06:36:38,680
And if you think about that a little more,

4690
06:36:38,680 --> 06:36:42,680
you think, hmm, well, where do I get a free variable?

4691
06:36:42,680 --> 06:36:45,680
Well, a free variable is one whose column

4692
06:36:45,680 --> 06:36:47,680
does not contain a pivot position.

4693
06:36:47,680 --> 06:36:49,680
So the dimension of the null space

4694
06:36:49,680 --> 06:36:53,680
is a number of free variables in AX equals zero,

4695
06:36:53,680 --> 06:36:59,680
also equal to the number of non-pivot columns in the matrix.

4696
06:36:59,680 --> 06:37:02,680
Okay, for this particular matrix,

4697
06:37:02,680 --> 06:37:04,680
dimension of the null space is three,

4698
06:37:04,680 --> 06:37:06,680
because here's a non-pivot column,

4699
06:37:06,680 --> 06:37:09,680
the third one, and the fourth and...

4700
06:37:09,680 --> 06:37:10,680
Oh, fifth and sixth.

4701
06:37:10,680 --> 06:37:13,680
So the third column, fifth column, sixth column,

4702
06:37:13,680 --> 06:37:15,680
is called non-pivot columns,

4703
06:37:15,680 --> 06:37:18,680
so we have three non-pivot columns,

4704
06:37:18,680 --> 06:37:23,680
and therefore the dimension of the null space is three.

4705
06:37:23,680 --> 06:37:27,680
All right, so once again, this number three pops up.

4706
06:37:27,680 --> 06:37:29,680
We have dimension of the column space is three,

4707
06:37:29,680 --> 06:37:31,680
dimension of the null space is three.

4708
06:37:31,680 --> 06:37:35,680
So I ask again, is this a coincidence?

4709
06:37:35,680 --> 06:37:41,680
Hmm, and the answer is...

4710
06:37:41,680 --> 06:37:43,680
It is a coincidence.

4711
06:37:43,680 --> 06:37:47,680
It's a coincidence because dimension of the column space

4712
06:37:47,680 --> 06:37:49,680
is the number of pivot columns,

4713
06:37:49,680 --> 06:37:53,680
dimension of the null space is the number of non-pivot columns.

4714
06:37:53,680 --> 06:37:56,680
So when you add them together, you get what?

4715
06:37:56,680 --> 06:37:58,680
The number of columns in the matrix.

4716
06:37:58,680 --> 06:38:01,680
So it just so happened that there were six columns

4717
06:38:01,680 --> 06:38:04,680
in this matrix, and so if the dimension of the column space

4718
06:38:04,680 --> 06:38:07,680
is three, then the dimension of the null space

4719
06:38:07,680 --> 06:38:10,680
is going to be six minus three, which is also three.

4720
06:38:10,680 --> 06:38:12,680
That's totally coincidence.

4721
06:38:12,680 --> 06:38:16,680
Had there been seven columns, the dimension of the null space

4722
06:38:16,680 --> 06:38:18,680
would have been four.

4723
06:38:18,680 --> 06:38:21,680
All right, so we have the dimension of the column space

4724
06:38:21,680 --> 06:38:23,680
plus the dimension of the null space is equal

4725
06:38:23,680 --> 06:38:25,680
to the number of columns,

4726
06:38:25,680 --> 06:38:27,680
and since the dimension of the column space

4727
06:38:27,680 --> 06:38:29,680
is equal to the dimension of the row space,

4728
06:38:29,680 --> 06:38:31,680
we have the dimension of the row space

4729
06:38:31,680 --> 06:38:33,680
plus the dimension of the null space

4730
06:38:33,680 --> 06:38:36,680
is equal to the number of columns,

4731
06:38:36,680 --> 06:38:44,380
one more time since the dimension of the column space and the dimension of the row space are equal to the rank of a.

4732
06:38:44,380 --> 06:38:52,460
We have the rank plus the dimension of the null space is equal to the number of columns.

4733
06:38:52,460 --> 06:38:59,260
Okay, so in this section we have another installment of the invertible matrix theorem.

4734
06:38:59,260 --> 06:39:10,160
And if you recall, we had this version of it or this installment of it back in section 2.3.

4735
06:39:10,160 --> 06:39:15,260
And so this should be seared into your memory at this point.

4736
06:39:15,260 --> 06:39:18,360
If not, you go back and review it.

4737
06:39:18,360 --> 06:39:27,260
But one of the pertinent things is recall that the whole idea here is that all these statements are equivalent,

4738
06:39:27,260 --> 06:39:29,960
which means that they're either all true or all false.

4739
06:39:29,960 --> 06:39:33,560
Number one here says A is an invertible matrix.

4740
06:39:33,560 --> 06:39:40,160
Now, one of the most important pieces of this is number three, that A has n pivot positions.

4741
06:39:40,160 --> 06:39:46,360
Because if you recall, when I was telling you about how to remember all this,

4742
06:39:46,360 --> 06:39:51,260
I told you the easiest way is to relate everything to pivot positions.

4743
06:39:51,260 --> 06:39:59,160
So if we can establish for any part of this that A has n pivot positions, then we're done.

4744
06:39:59,160 --> 06:40:06,660
All right, so what we have new here, we have six new things, four of them are given here.

4745
06:40:06,660 --> 06:40:08,660
So let's take a look at these.

4746
06:40:08,660 --> 06:40:13,760
Number one says the columns of A form a basis for our end.

4747
06:40:13,760 --> 06:40:23,960
Okay, if that's true, their basis for our end, then that means that they must be linearly independent and they must span our end.

4748
06:40:23,960 --> 06:40:29,760
Either one of those says that there's a pivot position in every row and every column.

4749
06:40:29,760 --> 06:40:32,260
Therefore, their end pivot positions.

4750
06:40:32,260 --> 06:40:35,060
So A is invertible.

4751
06:40:35,060 --> 06:40:39,160
The column space of A equals our end.

4752
06:40:39,160 --> 06:40:47,760
That means that the columns of A span our end, which again, they can only do that if there's a pivot position in every row,

4753
06:40:47,760 --> 06:40:50,760
meaning there's n pivot positions.

4754
06:40:50,760 --> 06:40:53,960
The dimension of the column space is n.

4755
06:40:53,960 --> 06:40:57,660
That actually falls from number two here.

4756
06:40:57,660 --> 06:41:03,460
If column space of A equals our end, we know that there are n vectors and a basis for our end.

4757
06:41:03,460 --> 06:41:07,060
So therefore, the dimension of the column space is n.

4758
06:41:07,060 --> 06:41:08,460
And the rank of A equals n.

4759
06:41:08,460 --> 06:41:14,760
That falls from number three since the dimension of the column space is equal to the rank of a matrix.

4760
06:41:14,760 --> 06:41:18,560
Okay, then we have two more that deal with the null space.

4761
06:41:18,560 --> 06:41:22,760
Null space of A is just the zero vector.

4762
06:41:22,760 --> 06:41:31,460
Okay, so if that's true, then that means that if we look at the system AX equals zero, it has only the trivial solution.

4763
06:41:31,460 --> 06:41:41,460
That happens when there are no free variables, which means there's a pivot position in every column, which means they're in pivot positions.

4764
06:41:41,460 --> 06:41:51,060
And from number five follows number six because if you have only the zero vector, then that's a special case.

4765
06:41:51,060 --> 06:41:57,560
And we define the dimension of that vector space to be zero.

4766
06:41:57,560 --> 06:42:02,760
All right, so all these are equivalent to the statement that A is an invertible matrix.

4767
06:42:02,760 --> 06:42:09,760
So just like with those, the first ten, I believe it was, let's see, yep, first ten.

4768
06:42:09,760 --> 06:42:20,960
These extra six, you need to commit them to memory relating them to each other or to pivot positions.

4769
06:42:20,960 --> 06:42:28,360
All right, I want to go through some of the some of the problems at the end of this section because there's some excellent problems here.

4770
06:42:28,360 --> 06:42:34,260
In fact, this section I think is the most important section in the course.

4771
06:42:34,260 --> 06:42:40,960
So make sure that you really work on these problems and understand what you're doing here.

4772
06:42:40,960 --> 06:42:44,760
So I'm going to do several of them at the end of the section.

4773
06:42:44,760 --> 06:42:52,860
Okay, so the first one says suppose a five by six matrix, let's call it A, has four pivot columns.

4774
06:42:52,860 --> 06:42:57,160
Okay, so it's a five by six matrix with four pivot columns.

4775
06:42:57,160 --> 06:43:04,260
Okay, if it has four pivot columns, then that means it has two non-pivot columns.

4776
06:43:04,260 --> 06:43:07,060
So what's the dimension of the null space of A?

4777
06:43:07,060 --> 06:43:08,660
Must be two, right?

4778
06:43:08,660 --> 06:43:11,860
Because you got two non-pivot columns.

4779
06:43:11,860 --> 06:43:14,960
Is the column space of A equal to R4?

4780
06:43:14,960 --> 06:43:23,660
Well, the dimension of the column space is four because we have four pivot columns.

4781
06:43:23,660 --> 06:43:37,260
Okay, so the dimension of the column space is four, but the columns are in R5 and therefore they are the span of the columns is not equal to R4.

4782
06:43:37,260 --> 06:43:41,560
It's just a subset of R5.

4783
06:43:41,560 --> 06:43:42,960
All right, next one.

4784
06:43:42,960 --> 06:43:48,160
If the null space of a seven by six matrix is five dimensional.

4785
06:43:48,160 --> 06:44:02,660
Okay, so that means you have five non-pivot columns, which means out of six columns, one is a pivot column, then therefore the dimension of the column space has to be one.

4786
06:44:02,660 --> 06:44:10,260
All right, suppose the null space of a five by six matrix is four dimensional.

4787
06:44:10,260 --> 06:44:20,360
Then that means you have four non-pivot columns, so that leaves two pivot columns and we want to know the dimension of the row space.

4788
06:44:20,360 --> 06:44:26,760
We have two pivot columns, so that means we have two non-zero rows when we put the matrix in echelon form.

4789
06:44:26,760 --> 06:44:30,860
So the dimension of the row space is two.

4790
06:44:30,860 --> 06:44:33,460
All right, and what if A is four by three?

4791
06:44:33,460 --> 06:44:38,760
What is the largest possible dimension of the row space?

4792
06:44:38,760 --> 06:44:52,160
All right, well, if A is four by three, then we could have at most three pivot positions, so at most three non-zero rows when we put it in echelon form.

4793
06:44:52,160 --> 06:45:00,760
So the maximum dimension of the row space is three.

4794
06:45:00,760 --> 06:45:07,560
All right, if A is three by four, what's the largest possible dimension of the row space?

4795
06:45:07,560 --> 06:45:14,360
Three by four, then again, the maximum number of pivot positions we can have is three.

4796
06:45:14,360 --> 06:45:22,860
So we have at most three non-zero rows, so the maximum dimension of the row space is three.

4797
06:45:22,860 --> 06:45:24,960
How about if A is six by four?

4798
06:45:24,960 --> 06:45:28,760
What is the smallest possible dimension of the null space?

4799
06:45:28,760 --> 06:45:38,360
That's asking what's the smallest number of free variables you can have, or what's the smallest number of non-pivot columns you could have?

4800
06:45:38,360 --> 06:45:52,160
Well, since we have more rows than columns, every column could be a pivot column, in which case there's no free variables, and so the minimum dimension of the null space of A would be zero.

4801
06:45:52,160 --> 06:45:57,460
All right, a little more complicated one here.

4802
06:45:57,460 --> 06:46:07,860
Suppose a non-homogeneous system of six equations and eight unknowns has a solution with two free variables.

4803
06:46:07,860 --> 06:46:16,160
Is it possible to change some constants on the equation's right sides to make the new system inconsistent?

4804
06:46:16,160 --> 06:46:17,560
All right, we got it.

4805
06:46:17,560 --> 06:46:24,460
A non-homogeneous system, six equations and eight unknowns, and it's consistent with two free variables.

4806
06:46:24,460 --> 06:46:34,060
And what that tells you with the two free variables is that you have, since there's eight unknowns, we got eight columns.

4807
06:46:34,060 --> 06:46:40,060
Two are free, so that means there are six that are pivot columns.

4808
06:46:40,060 --> 06:46:41,360
Okay, so that would look like this.

4809
06:46:41,360 --> 06:46:49,060
We've got six rows here, eight columns, two free variables, which leaves six pivot columns.

4810
06:46:49,160 --> 06:46:57,660
All right, and it's saying if we change the right-hand side, will the system still be consistent?

4811
06:46:57,660 --> 06:47:04,360
And the answer is yes.

4812
06:47:04,360 --> 06:47:08,160
Plug my computer in.

4813
06:47:08,160 --> 06:47:12,360
Is it possible to change some constants to make the new system inconsistent?

4814
06:47:12,560 --> 06:47:23,360
The answer is no to that, because no matter what's over here, since you have a pivot position in each row, the system's always going to be consistent.

4815
06:47:23,360 --> 06:47:26,660
No, I was thinking the question was, is the system always consistent?

4816
06:47:26,660 --> 06:47:30,060
And the answer to that is yes.

4817
06:47:30,060 --> 06:47:33,760
And that is because you have a pivot position in every row.

4818
06:47:33,760 --> 06:47:40,360
So you're never going to end up with a row of all zeros and then something not zero over here.

4819
06:47:40,360 --> 06:47:41,660
All right, another one.

4820
06:47:41,660 --> 06:47:54,160
Is it possible that all solutions of a homogeneous system of two equations and four unknowns are multiples of one fixed nonzero solution?

4821
06:47:54,160 --> 06:47:59,660
Okay, homogeneous system, two equations and four unknowns.

4822
06:47:59,660 --> 06:48:06,760
So if you think about that, we've got two rows and four columns, so we have at least two free variables.

4823
06:48:06,760 --> 06:48:13,860
So if we wrote our solution in parametric vector form, so we had two free variables, then it would look like this.

4824
06:48:13,860 --> 06:48:23,160
You know, what this says is that each solution is a linear combination of two fixed nonzero solutions, right?

4825
06:48:23,160 --> 06:48:29,060
Each one of these vectors is what they're calling a fixed nonzero solution.

4826
06:48:29,060 --> 06:48:32,360
So we're going to have at least two of these vectors.

4827
06:48:32,360 --> 06:48:43,160
So that means that it can't be the case that all the solutions are just multiples of one nonzero solution.

4828
06:48:43,160 --> 06:48:52,860
If that was the case, we would only have one vector here and we can't have that because we have at least two free variables.

4829
06:48:52,860 --> 06:48:55,760
All right, another one.

4830
06:48:55,760 --> 06:49:06,660
Is it possible for a non-homogeneous system of three equations and two unknowns to have a unique solution for some right-hand side of constants?

4831
06:49:06,660 --> 06:49:10,660
So three equations, two variables.

4832
06:49:10,660 --> 06:49:15,160
All right, so that might look like this, three equations, two variables.

4833
06:49:15,160 --> 06:49:22,660
So you could have a pivot position in each column and you could have a row of all zeros.

4834
06:49:22,660 --> 06:49:31,960
In that case, yes, the system would be consistent and there would be a unique solution.

4835
06:49:31,960 --> 06:49:33,560
All right, how about this one?

4836
06:49:33,560 --> 06:49:39,660
Is it possible for such a system to have a unique solution for every right-hand side?

4837
06:49:39,660 --> 06:49:47,860
And, okay, look at that, you could have this situation still have pivot position in each column,

4838
06:49:47,860 --> 06:49:54,660
but have zero, zero, something not zero in which case there's no solution, right?

4839
06:49:54,660 --> 06:50:02,460
So in this case, it's not possible for such a system to have any sort of solution for every right-hand side, right?

4840
06:50:02,460 --> 06:50:07,060
In some cases, it's simply going to be inconsistent.

4841
06:50:07,060 --> 06:50:12,560
All right, that's it for this one.

4842
06:50:12,560 --> 06:50:17,260
Okay, our topic for today is Markov chains.

4843
06:50:17,260 --> 06:50:25,260
And to get us going on that, look at a small example.

4844
06:50:25,260 --> 06:50:36,160
So let's suppose in a given urban area, each year, 5% of the population that's in the city moves to the suburbs

4845
06:50:36,160 --> 06:50:40,860
and 3% of the suburban population moves to the city.

4846
06:50:40,860 --> 06:50:46,160
And we're going to assume that this is a closed system here.

4847
06:50:46,160 --> 06:50:52,560
So any movement just goes from the city to the suburbs or suburbs to the city.

4848
06:50:52,560 --> 06:50:58,260
So we're not considering moving elsewhere or people moving in from elsewhere.

4849
06:50:58,260 --> 06:51:03,460
So just city to suburban, suburban to city.

4850
06:51:03,460 --> 06:51:07,860
Okay, so let's assume that the current city population is 600,000

4851
06:51:07,860 --> 06:51:11,560
and the current suburban population is 400,000.

4852
06:51:11,560 --> 06:51:17,460
Then what will the population of each be a year from now?

4853
06:51:17,460 --> 06:51:27,160
Well, based on what we know next year, the city population is going to be 95% of what it is now, right?

4854
06:51:27,160 --> 06:51:32,060
Because we each year 5% leave, so we're keeping 95%.

4855
06:51:32,060 --> 06:51:41,760
And then 3% of the suburban population moves to the city, so we add on 0.03 times the current suburban population.

4856
06:51:41,760 --> 06:51:49,660
So that's 0.95 times 600,000 plus 0.03 times 400,000, which gives us 582,000.

4857
06:51:49,660 --> 06:51:53,460
So it makes sense that the city population is going down.

4858
06:51:53,460 --> 06:51:58,860
We've got more moving to the suburbs than we have coming in.

4859
06:51:59,060 --> 06:52:06,260
To find the suburban population in a year, we could just say, well, since the total is a million,

4860
06:52:06,260 --> 06:52:12,760
then we can just say a million minus 582,000 and get it that way, which is correct.

4861
06:52:12,760 --> 06:52:16,560
But we could also look at it the way we did with the city and say, well,

4862
06:52:16,560 --> 06:52:26,360
we're getting 5% of the city population moving to the suburbs and 97% of the current suburban population is staying there.

4863
06:52:26,360 --> 06:52:42,060
So we get 0.05 times 600,000 plus 0.97 times 400,000, which gives us 418,000, and 418 plus 582 gives a million total.

4864
06:52:42,060 --> 06:52:55,160
Another way to look at it is let's take a closer look at those equations and notice that we've got 600,000 times the 0.95, 0.05 here.

4865
06:52:55,160 --> 06:52:59,360
And we've got the 400,000 times the 0.03 and the 0.97.

4866
06:52:59,360 --> 06:53:08,160
And that looks like we're taking a linear combination of a couple of vectors, the 0.95, the 0.05 and the 0.03, 0.97.

4867
06:53:08,160 --> 06:53:13,160
So we're going to rewrite it in this form as a matrix times a vector.

4868
06:53:13,160 --> 06:53:19,660
And so the linear combination is just 600,000 times the first column plus 400,000 times the second column.

4869
06:53:19,660 --> 06:53:24,560
And that gives us our population figures for one year from now.

4870
06:53:24,560 --> 06:53:33,560
You can also look at it as percentages, which is typical instead of actual raw numbers.

4871
06:53:33,560 --> 06:53:47,060
So if we look at the population vectors 0.6, 0.4, we do the same sort of computation and end up with this population vector for a year from now.

4872
06:53:47,060 --> 06:53:55,760
And if you notice that each one of these vectors, the columns of the matrix plus our two vectors here, each one of them sums to one.

4873
06:53:55,760 --> 06:54:04,560
So they're special vectors because they represent probabilities or percentages.

4874
06:54:04,560 --> 06:54:07,560
And we'll talk about that a little more in just a minute.

4875
06:54:07,560 --> 06:54:16,960
But before we get to that, notice that what we have here, this is of the form, some matrix, which I'm calling m, times a vector I'll call x naught,

4876
06:54:16,960 --> 06:54:23,060
which is like the original state of the system, original population.

4877
06:54:23,060 --> 06:54:29,460
We multiply those together to get x1, which is the state in year one.

4878
06:54:29,460 --> 06:54:39,060
We can continue that process to figure out what the population in year two would be, year three and so forth, year k plus one.

4879
06:54:39,060 --> 06:54:45,060
For any year, it's just m times the population from the previous year.

4880
06:54:45,160 --> 06:54:55,960
So for instance, if I wanted to figure out 10 years from now, what's the population, then I could compute x2, which is, well, to compute x10, I need x9,

4881
06:54:55,960 --> 06:54:58,360
because x10 is m times x9.

4882
06:54:58,360 --> 06:55:02,760
To get x9, I need x8, to get x8, I need x7 and so forth.

4883
06:55:02,760 --> 06:55:08,360
So I'd have to compute all those intermediate population vectors.

4884
06:55:08,360 --> 06:55:14,760
There is another way to do it, which doesn't require that computation.

4885
06:55:14,760 --> 06:55:18,960
And that is to look at it as I have here at the bottom.

4886
06:55:18,960 --> 06:55:25,760
If we look at x2, for example, that's m times x1, but we know that x1 is m times x0.

4887
06:55:25,760 --> 06:55:29,960
So x2 turns out to be m squared times x0.

4888
06:55:29,960 --> 06:55:35,260
Similarly, x3 is m times x2, but we know x2 is m squared x0.

4889
06:55:35,260 --> 06:55:38,660
So x3 is just m cubed times x0.

4890
06:55:38,660 --> 06:55:47,260
And in general, we have xk, your k population would be m to the k times the original population vector.

4891
06:55:50,060 --> 06:55:57,660
Okay, so a vector with non-negative entries that add up to 1 is called a probability vector.

4892
06:55:57,660 --> 06:56:04,860
So back to these, all these are probability vectors because they all add up to 1.

4893
06:56:04,860 --> 06:56:07,060
Each column adds up to 1.

4894
06:56:08,860 --> 06:56:16,060
Okay, a stochastic matrix is a square matrix whose columns are probability vectors.

4895
06:56:16,060 --> 06:56:23,960
So the matrix that we had here, that is a stochastic matrix because each of its columns is a probability vector.

4896
06:56:23,960 --> 06:56:30,060
A vector where their entries are non-negative and they sum to 1.

4897
06:56:30,060 --> 06:56:35,960
A Markov chain is a sequence of probability vectors, x0, x1, x2, and so forth,

4898
06:56:35,960 --> 06:56:43,360
together with a stochastic matrix m, such that x sub k plus 1 is just m times x sub k,

4899
06:56:43,360 --> 06:56:47,360
which is the pattern that we had in our example.

4900
06:56:49,860 --> 06:56:57,560
The i-th entry in xk is the probability that the system is in state i at time k.

4901
06:56:57,660 --> 06:57:05,960
Okay, and we call xk a state vector because it represents the state of the system at time k.

4902
06:57:08,060 --> 06:57:13,360
Okay, now an interesting question related to our population example is,

4903
06:57:13,360 --> 06:57:17,260
will there ever be a point at which there's no net population change?

4904
06:57:17,260 --> 06:57:23,160
That is, the number of people moving to the suburbs is equal to the number of people moving to the city.

4905
06:57:24,160 --> 06:57:30,460
Okay, another way to look at it is, will there ever be a point at which xk plus 1 is equal to xk?

4906
06:57:30,460 --> 06:57:36,960
Alright, so you compute xk plus 1, and it's the same as xk.

4907
06:57:38,960 --> 06:57:44,360
Or will there ever be a point at which you have your current state as some vector x?

4908
06:57:44,360 --> 06:57:50,560
You apply the transition matrix m to it, and you end up back with the same vector x.

4909
06:57:51,560 --> 06:57:54,960
Okay, and so this is the system we want to look at.

4910
06:57:54,960 --> 06:57:59,960
It's similar to systems that we know how to solve, but it's a little bit different,

4911
06:57:59,960 --> 06:58:03,360
because on the right-hand side here, we've got a variable.

4912
06:58:03,360 --> 06:58:08,760
It's not a constant, so it's not like an ax equals b system.

4913
06:58:09,760 --> 06:58:19,560
So we need to manipulate it a bit before we can use the things that we know about solving systems.

4914
06:58:21,560 --> 06:58:24,560
Okay, so we want to know, is it consistent?

4915
06:58:24,560 --> 06:58:32,560
And the way we determine that is, we bring the x over to the left-hand side.

4916
06:58:32,560 --> 06:58:35,560
We get mx minus x is a zero vector.

4917
06:58:35,560 --> 06:58:39,560
And then the key is to factor out that x.

4918
06:58:39,560 --> 06:58:44,560
And if we factor out the x, then we're left with m minus the identity matrix.

4919
06:58:44,560 --> 06:58:46,560
So i here is the identity matrix.

4920
06:58:46,560 --> 06:58:52,560
So what we end up with is some matrix, which is m minus the identity matrix, which we can compute directly.

4921
06:58:52,560 --> 06:58:54,560
We know both of those.

4922
06:58:54,560 --> 06:58:57,560
Times x, which we don't know, equals a zero vector.

4923
06:58:57,560 --> 06:59:02,560
So when we write it in this form here, it's a simple homogeneous system.

4924
06:59:02,560 --> 06:59:10,560
Now clearly, it's consistent because x can be the zero vector, and that obviously makes that consistent.

4925
06:59:10,560 --> 06:59:13,560
However, that's not a very interesting case.

4926
06:59:13,560 --> 06:59:20,560
What we really want to know is, does this system have an infinite number of solutions?

4927
06:59:20,560 --> 06:59:22,560
Are there any free variables?

4928
06:59:24,560 --> 06:59:30,560
Alright, well if we look at this matrix for our example,

4929
06:59:30,560 --> 06:59:34,560
so we subtract off the identity, and we're left with this one,

4930
06:59:34,560 --> 06:59:38,560
and it's clear when you look at that that the columns are not linearly independent,

4931
06:59:38,560 --> 06:59:41,560
and therefore you have a free variable.

4932
06:59:41,560 --> 06:59:43,560
So we solve this system.

4933
06:59:43,560 --> 06:59:45,560
It's pretty straightforward.

4934
06:59:45,560 --> 06:59:50,560
One row operation, and we zeroed out the bottom row.

4935
06:59:50,560 --> 06:59:58,560
And so first row tells us that 5 multiplied by 100 makes life simple.

4936
06:59:58,560 --> 07:00:01,560
So we get 5x1 equals 3x2.

4937
07:00:01,560 --> 07:00:07,560
So that means x1 is 3 fifths times x2, where x2 is a free variable.

4938
07:00:07,560 --> 07:00:23,560
And to get the actual vector, the probability vector that corresponds to this relationship between x1 and x2,

4939
07:00:23,560 --> 07:00:27,560
we want x1 plus x2 to equal a million.

4940
07:00:27,560 --> 07:00:32,560
Or we could say 1, I'm doing it just for raw population numbers.

4941
07:00:32,560 --> 07:00:37,560
And x1 is 3 fifths x2, so we get this equation.

4942
07:00:37,560 --> 07:00:44,560
Putting these two together, 8 fifths x2 is a million, which says x2 is 625,000,

4943
07:00:44,560 --> 07:00:49,560
and therefore x1 is 375,000.

4944
07:00:49,560 --> 07:00:59,560
Alright, so we've reached the point here that the number moving out of the city

4945
07:00:59,560 --> 07:01:07,560
is 0.05 times 375,000, because every year 5% leave the city.

4946
07:01:07,560 --> 07:01:14,560
So the population of the city at this point is 375,000, so 5% of that's 18,750.

4947
07:01:14,560 --> 07:01:21,560
Likewise, the total moving out of the suburbs, which is 3% of the suburb population,

4948
07:01:21,560 --> 07:01:27,560
which at this point is 625,000, is also equal to 18,750.

4949
07:01:27,560 --> 07:01:33,560
So we've reached the point here where the number moving out of the city is equal to the number moving in.

4950
07:01:33,560 --> 07:01:44,560
So there's no net population change once the system gets to this point.

4951
07:01:44,560 --> 07:01:48,560
Alright, a little more terminology for you.

4952
07:01:48,560 --> 07:01:55,560
If P is a stochastic matrix, then a steady state vector, also called equilibrium vector,

4953
07:01:55,560 --> 07:02:01,560
for P is a probability vector Q such that P times Q is equal to Q.

4954
07:02:01,560 --> 07:02:06,560
Before we said M times X equals X, talking about the same thing here.

4955
07:02:06,560 --> 07:02:17,560
Alright, we have this theorem that says if P is a stochastic matrix, then it has a unique steady state vector.

4956
07:02:17,560 --> 07:02:25,560
Even though the system has an infinite number of solutions, if we require the elements sum to 1,

4957
07:02:25,560 --> 07:02:29,560
then that makes it a unique vector.

4958
07:02:29,560 --> 07:02:39,560
Furthermore, if X naught is any initial state and we have X sub K plus 1 equals P times X sub K,

4959
07:02:39,560 --> 07:02:45,560
then the Markov chain converges to Q as K goes to infinity.

4960
07:02:45,560 --> 07:02:52,560
So what's interesting about this is that the initial state is unimportant.

4961
07:02:52,560 --> 07:03:07,560
It says if X naught is any initial state, then the Markov chain will converge to this steady state vector as if you go to a big enough K.

4962
07:03:07,560 --> 07:03:10,560
Okay, so let's look at another example.

4963
07:03:10,560 --> 07:03:17,560
Here's a matrix, so let's get a 3 by 3 and find a steady state vector for this matrix.

4964
07:03:17,560 --> 07:03:22,560
So we need to compute P minus the identity, so there's that.

4965
07:03:22,560 --> 07:03:26,560
And then we need to solve P minus I times X equals 0.

4966
07:03:26,560 --> 07:03:31,560
So do a few row operations, end up with this matrix.

4967
07:03:31,560 --> 07:03:39,560
And so the solution is X1 is X3, X2 is a half of X3, where X3 is free.

4968
07:03:39,560 --> 07:03:45,560
You can see X1 equals X3, X2 is a half of X3, and X3 is free.

4969
07:03:45,560 --> 07:03:55,560
And again, the elements need to sum to 1, so we get, since X1 is X3, X2 is a half of X3,

4970
07:03:55,560 --> 07:03:58,560
that's where this second equation comes from.

4971
07:03:58,560 --> 07:04:06,560
And it turns out that X3 has to be 2 fifths, so that means X1 is 2 fifths and X2 is 1 fifth.

4972
07:04:06,560 --> 07:04:10,560
So the steady state vector is this one here.

4973
07:04:10,560 --> 07:04:17,560
And if you check out what P times X is, multiply P times the steady state vector,

4974
07:04:17,560 --> 07:04:25,560
turns out you get that steady state vector back, so it checks out.

4975
07:04:25,560 --> 07:04:31,560
Alright, I want to show you one more application problem, and this one I've taken from another book,

4976
07:04:31,560 --> 07:04:35,560
by Andrillian Hecker, it's kind of interesting when I thought.

4977
07:04:35,560 --> 07:04:37,560
And it's based on banks.

4978
07:04:37,560 --> 07:04:43,560
I suppose you've got three banks in a certain town that compete for business.

4979
07:04:43,560 --> 07:04:49,560
And Bank A right now has 40% of the customers, B has 10%, and C has 50%.

4980
07:04:49,560 --> 07:05:00,560
So we write that vector as, given here, 0.4, corresponds to Bank A, 0.1 for Bank B, and C with a 0.5.

4981
07:05:01,560 --> 07:05:08,560
Okay, so the banks are obviously trying to woo customers from the other banks.

4982
07:05:08,560 --> 07:05:16,560
And what we have here is information about how successful they are at that.

4983
07:05:16,560 --> 07:05:22,560
So we see that records show that each year Bank A keeps half of its investors with the remainder,

4984
07:05:22,560 --> 07:05:24,560
switching equally to B and C.

4985
07:05:24,560 --> 07:05:27,560
So if you look at the first column of this matrix,

4986
07:05:27,560 --> 07:05:33,560
that is, you can think of this column as being related to Bank A.

4987
07:05:33,560 --> 07:05:41,560
In each row, the first row corresponds to Bank A, the second row to B, and the third row to C.

4988
07:05:41,560 --> 07:05:47,560
So I've got an A column, a B column, a C column, and an A row, a B row, and a C row.

4989
07:05:47,560 --> 07:05:55,560
So the 0.5 here represents the probability that a person at Bank A is going to stay at Bank A.

4990
07:05:55,560 --> 07:06:03,560
Then the 0.25, here, represents the probability that a person in Bank A is going to switch to Bank B.

4991
07:06:03,560 --> 07:06:11,560
And the 0.25 at the bottom represents the probability that a person currently at Bank A is going to switch to Bank C.

4992
07:06:11,560 --> 07:06:17,640
All right and says bank B keeps two-thirds of its investors with the remainder switching

4993
07:06:17,640 --> 07:06:19,320
equally to the other two.

4994
07:06:19,320 --> 07:06:25,720
So the point 667, that's the probability that someone who starts at bank B or who's currently

4995
07:06:25,720 --> 07:06:30,880
at bank B is going to stay there for the next year.

4996
07:06:30,880 --> 07:06:36,400
And then the point 167 here, that's probability someone who currently is at bank B switches

4997
07:06:36,400 --> 07:06:40,480
to bank A. Okay, and same thing down here.

4998
07:06:40,480 --> 07:06:46,720
Probably at bank, a probability that a bank B customer will switch to bank C. Then we

4999
07:06:46,720 --> 07:06:51,440
say bank C keeps half of its investors and the remainder switching equally the other

5000
07:06:51,440 --> 07:06:52,440
two.

5001
07:06:52,440 --> 07:06:58,240
So the point five here is probability that customer at bank C stays at bank C. And these

5002
07:06:58,240 --> 07:07:03,120
point two-fives here, probability that somebody at bank C switches to A here and switches

5003
07:07:03,120 --> 07:07:04,520
to B here.

5004
07:07:05,240 --> 07:07:10,520
So this is what we call our transition matrix.

5005
07:07:10,520 --> 07:07:17,320
And as I said, the ijth entry represents the fraction of current investors going from bank

5006
07:07:17,320 --> 07:07:20,560
J to bank I.

5007
07:07:20,560 --> 07:07:32,040
So we think of, again, think of this as labeled columns ABC, rows ABC, the entry, a particular

5008
07:07:32,040 --> 07:07:39,640
entry represents person switching from whatever column they're in to whatever row that value

5009
07:07:39,640 --> 07:07:40,640
is.

5010
07:07:40,640 --> 07:07:48,480
Like to find the distribution of investors after one year, we take our transition matrix

5011
07:07:48,480 --> 07:07:54,160
multiplied by the current state vector, which is this one.

5012
07:07:54,160 --> 07:07:58,240
And that gives us this vector here.

5013
07:07:58,240 --> 07:08:06,480
After two years, multiply the transition matrix times the distribution after one year.

5014
07:08:06,480 --> 07:08:12,120
So just take that one, slide it in here, do that multiplication, and here's what we have

5015
07:08:12,120 --> 07:08:13,320
after two years.

5016
07:08:13,320 --> 07:08:19,320
And so you can keep doing that for as many years as you're interested in.

5017
07:08:19,320 --> 07:08:24,880
If you would like to find the steady state vector, then you compute M minus the identity,

5018
07:08:25,320 --> 07:08:29,840
which gives you this matrix, and then you solve the system M minus i times x equals

5019
07:08:29,840 --> 07:08:37,840
zero, which do some row operations that takes you to this point.

5020
07:08:37,840 --> 07:08:46,400
And so we have x1 equals x3, x2 is equal to 1.5 times x3, x3 is free.

5021
07:08:46,400 --> 07:08:50,400
You should always end up with a free variable here, because otherwise you have the unique

5022
07:08:50,400 --> 07:08:56,360
solution, which is the zero vector, and that's an error, because it should always be a free

5023
07:08:56,360 --> 07:08:59,360
variable.

5024
07:08:59,360 --> 07:09:09,200
I have the element sum to 1 tells us that x3 is 2 7ths, and so our steady state vector

5025
07:09:09,200 --> 07:09:18,360
looks like this, 2 7ths, 3 7ths, 2 7ths, and I didn't actually compute those probabilities.

5026
07:09:19,320 --> 07:09:27,320
But this is the method that you would use.

5027
07:09:27,320 --> 07:09:33,240
OK, today our topic is eigenvalues and eigenvectors.

5028
07:09:33,240 --> 07:09:38,840
The equation that we're interested in when trying to find eigenvalues and eigenvectors

5029
07:09:38,840 --> 07:09:44,320
is this one, ax equals lambda times x.

5030
07:09:44,320 --> 07:09:47,680
Here a is an n by n matrix.

5031
07:09:47,680 --> 07:09:53,520
X is a vector in our n, and lambda is a scalar.

5032
07:09:53,520 --> 07:10:00,680
So we're essentially asking, can you find x and lambda, we don't know either of those,

5033
07:10:00,680 --> 07:10:08,200
but can you find x and lambda such that when you multiply a times x, you get the same result

5034
07:10:08,200 --> 07:10:14,320
as simply scaling x by lambda.

5035
07:10:14,320 --> 07:10:21,240
So if x is not equal to 0 and satisfies ax equals lambda x, then it's said to be an

5036
07:10:21,240 --> 07:10:26,880
eigenvector of a with associated eigenvalue lambda.

5037
07:10:26,880 --> 07:10:33,200
So we require that eigenvectors not be 0, because clearly the zero vector satisfies this

5038
07:10:33,200 --> 07:10:38,000
equation, so we're looking for nonzero solutions.

5039
07:10:38,000 --> 07:10:44,120
So x would be an eigenvector, lambda, and eigenvalue.

5040
07:10:44,280 --> 07:10:50,680
We've seen a similar system to this when we were finding the steady state vector for

5041
07:10:50,680 --> 07:10:55,480
a transition matrix back when we were looking at Markov chains.

5042
07:10:55,480 --> 07:11:02,640
And that, if you remember, looked like this, we had mx equals x, so we wanted to know if

5043
07:11:02,640 --> 07:11:07,240
there was a vector x such that you apply the transition matrix to it and you get the same

5044
07:11:07,240 --> 07:11:11,040
vector back.

5045
07:11:11,320 --> 07:11:21,000
You just look at the x here as having a coefficient of 1, so we have mx equals 1 times x, then

5046
07:11:21,000 --> 07:11:29,520
it's of the same form as our eigenvector and eigenvalue equation, ax equals lambda x.

5047
07:11:29,520 --> 07:11:34,160
So we have seen systems like this before, and we're going to solve them in a similar

5048
07:11:34,160 --> 07:11:38,040
way as we did when we found the steady state vector.

5049
07:11:38,040 --> 07:11:42,400
So if you remember what we did then, we took the x over to the other side and factored

5050
07:11:42,400 --> 07:11:48,840
it out, and we ended up with m minus i times x equals 0, and that was the equation to solve

5051
07:11:48,840 --> 07:11:51,840
to find the steady state vector.

5052
07:11:51,840 --> 07:11:56,920
We're going to do a similar thing with our eigenvector system, bringing the lambda x

5053
07:11:56,920 --> 07:12:03,760
to the other side, factor out x, and we end up with a minus lambda times the identity

5054
07:12:03,760 --> 07:12:07,560
matrix times x equals 0.

5055
07:12:07,560 --> 07:12:10,520
So this is a system that we need to solve.

5056
07:12:10,520 --> 07:12:15,560
Now it's complicated here more so than with the Markov chains because we don't know what

5057
07:12:15,560 --> 07:12:16,560
lambda is.

5058
07:12:16,560 --> 07:12:20,080
We don't know x and we don't know lambda.

5059
07:12:20,080 --> 07:12:24,680
All right, now let's think about this a bit.

5060
07:12:24,680 --> 07:12:31,800
We know that x to be an eigenvector can't be the zero vector, so we have a homogeneous

5061
07:12:31,800 --> 07:12:37,560
system here, and we want to find non-trivial solutions to it.

5062
07:12:37,560 --> 07:12:41,960
All right, so some things that we know.

5063
07:12:41,960 --> 07:12:50,600
This system is going to have non-trivial solutions if it has free variables, and it has free

5064
07:12:50,600 --> 07:12:59,560
variables if the matrix a minus lambda i does not have a pivot position in every column.

5065
07:12:59,560 --> 07:13:05,320
And that happens when a minus lambda i is not invertible, right, because it doesn't

5066
07:13:05,320 --> 07:13:12,360
have a pivot position in every column, has fewer than n pivot positions, it's not invertible.

5067
07:13:12,360 --> 07:13:20,840
And that happens when the determinant of that matrix, a minus lambda i, is equal to zero.

5068
07:13:21,160 --> 07:13:27,360
This last item here is the key to how we are going to find eigenvalues.

5069
07:13:27,360 --> 07:13:36,920
Okay, so we're going to compute the determinant of a minus lambda i, and that actually turns

5070
07:13:36,920 --> 07:13:44,400
out to give us a polynomial, and we're going to set it equal to zero and solve for lambda.

5071
07:13:44,400 --> 07:13:50,080
Once we have the eigenvalues, then we can proceed to finding the eigenvectors by plugging

5072
07:13:50,080 --> 07:13:56,760
in what we know for lambda for the eigenvalues, and then we just have a simple homogeneous

5073
07:13:56,760 --> 07:13:58,600
system to solve to find x.

5074
07:13:58,600 --> 07:14:03,360
All right, so let's look at an example.

5075
07:14:03,360 --> 07:14:07,480
Here's a matrix a, it's a two by two.

5076
07:14:07,480 --> 07:14:15,120
We first find the eigenvalues of a by solving the determinant, a minus lambda i equals zero.

5077
07:14:15,120 --> 07:14:17,840
So here's a minus lambda i.

5078
07:14:17,840 --> 07:14:22,800
Here's a minus lambda times the identity matrix.

5079
07:14:22,800 --> 07:14:28,640
So we end up basically, what you end up with is just subtracting lambda off the diagonal

5080
07:14:28,640 --> 07:14:34,400
elements, and then we want to take the determinant of that matrix.

5081
07:14:34,400 --> 07:14:43,840
So we take the determinant, either criss cross, and we get this stuff, and we expand, put

5082
07:14:43,840 --> 07:14:50,440
it all together, and then factor it, and when we factor it, we get lambda minus eight times

5083
07:14:50,440 --> 07:14:55,880
lambda plus two, and we set that equal to zero, because that's what we want the determinant

5084
07:14:55,880 --> 07:15:01,080
of this matrix to equal zero, and clearly the solutions are lambda equals eight and lambda

5085
07:15:01,080 --> 07:15:02,760
equals negative two.

5086
07:15:02,760 --> 07:15:06,960
So those are our eigenvalues.

5087
07:15:07,960 --> 07:15:15,080
All right, here we ended up, we go back, we ended up with a lambda squared minus six

5088
07:15:15,080 --> 07:15:19,800
lambda minus sixteen, that's a quadratic function.

5089
07:15:19,800 --> 07:15:22,760
So there's two by two matrix, we ended up with a quadratic.

5090
07:15:22,760 --> 07:15:27,800
In general, if you have an n by n matrix, then the determinant of a minus lambda i will

5091
07:15:27,800 --> 07:15:30,960
be a polynomial of degree n.

5092
07:15:30,960 --> 07:15:36,040
So for a three by three, you get a cubic function, four by four, you get a degree four, and so

5093
07:15:36,040 --> 07:15:37,040
forth.

5094
07:15:37,040 --> 07:15:46,880
Okay, so at this point we have two eigenvalues for a, and we want to find the eigenvectors

5095
07:15:46,880 --> 07:15:53,320
associated with each of these eigenvalues.

5096
07:15:53,320 --> 07:15:56,800
So let's start off with lambda equals eight.

5097
07:15:56,800 --> 07:16:04,360
So we want to solve a minus lambda i, lambda in this case is eight, so a minus eight i times

5098
07:16:04,360 --> 07:16:07,080
x equals a zero vector.

5099
07:16:07,080 --> 07:16:13,320
So first we need to compute a minus eight i, and there it is, and then we set up that

5100
07:16:13,320 --> 07:16:19,080
homogeneous system, and remember that the whole point of finding the eigenvalues was

5101
07:16:19,080 --> 07:16:25,240
so that we would have a free variable, and so if you end up working on problems and you're

5102
07:16:25,240 --> 07:16:28,720
trying to find an eigenvector and you don't end up with a free variable, then you've made

5103
07:16:28,720 --> 07:16:30,960
a mistake somewhere.

5104
07:16:31,160 --> 07:16:35,600
Either you don't have a correct eigenvalue, or you made a mistake in solving this system.

5105
07:16:35,600 --> 07:16:41,200
So you should always end up with at least one free variable so that the system has

5106
07:16:41,200 --> 07:16:43,280
non-trivial solutions.

5107
07:16:43,280 --> 07:16:49,360
So in this case, we end up with x1 equals three x2, x2 is free.

5108
07:16:49,360 --> 07:16:57,360
So if we write it in parametric vector form, it looks like this, and so that tells us that

5109
07:16:57,360 --> 07:17:05,080
any multiple, any vector of this form, multiple of three one, is an eigenvector of a corresponding

5110
07:17:05,080 --> 07:17:09,240
to lambda equals eight.

5111
07:17:09,240 --> 07:17:11,880
You can check that to make sure it works.

5112
07:17:11,880 --> 07:17:17,720
A x should equal lambda x, so if we multiply eight times x, here's a, here's x, we end

5113
07:17:17,720 --> 07:17:24,600
up with a vector 24 eight, and we can factor out lambda, which is eight, and that we get

5114
07:17:24,600 --> 07:17:30,000
eight times three, eight times one, and three one is our vector x, so that's equal to lambda

5115
07:17:30,000 --> 07:17:32,920
x, so it works out.

5116
07:17:32,920 --> 07:17:36,760
This is an eigenvector corresponding to lambda equals eight.

5117
07:17:36,760 --> 07:17:43,560
All right, we got another eigenvalue to look at, lambda equals negative two, so we need

5118
07:17:43,560 --> 07:17:51,040
to solve a minus lambda i x equals zero again for lambda equals negative two.

5119
07:17:51,040 --> 07:17:58,480
So we got a minus minus two times i, it's just eight plus two times the identity, which

5120
07:17:58,480 --> 07:18:06,600
is this matrix, and we set up the homogeneous system, and again, do one row operation, the

5121
07:18:06,600 --> 07:18:11,840
second row goes away, we got a free variable, and here's our solution.

5122
07:18:11,840 --> 07:18:19,600
So if we write it in parametric vector form, we get this, and so that tells us that any

5123
07:18:19,600 --> 07:18:26,280
multiple of the vector negative one third one is an eigenvector of a corresponding to

5124
07:18:26,280 --> 07:18:33,480
the eigenvalue negative two, so you can check again like we did last time, multiply eight

5125
07:18:33,480 --> 07:18:40,000
times x, you get two negative six, and that is equal to negative two times negative one

5126
07:18:40,000 --> 07:18:46,280
three, which was the eigenvector that I picked.

5127
07:18:46,280 --> 07:18:51,280
You might be saying, hey, that didn't look like this one that we got here, and it doesn't

5128
07:18:51,280 --> 07:18:56,920
because I just multiplied, I scaled it, because remember, any multiple of this vector is an

5129
07:18:56,920 --> 07:19:06,120
eigenvector, so I just chose x two to be three, and scaled it, and so three times negative

5130
07:19:06,120 --> 07:19:10,960
one third gave me the negative one, and then three times one gave me three, and I did that

5131
07:19:10,960 --> 07:19:13,400
just to get rid of the fraction there.

5132
07:19:13,400 --> 07:19:19,600
But any multiple, any non-zero multiple, I should say, any non-zero multiple of this

5133
07:19:19,600 --> 07:19:29,400
vector would be an eigenvector corresponding to lambda equals negative two, alright.

5134
07:19:29,400 --> 07:19:36,000
So given an eigenvalue lambda of a matrix A, we solve this homogeneous system, A minus

5135
07:19:36,000 --> 07:19:43,960
lambda i times x equals zero to find the associated eigenvector, or eigenvectors, alright.

5136
07:19:43,960 --> 07:19:50,640
Now a little bit of terminology here, think back to the previous chapter, we talked about

5137
07:19:50,640 --> 07:19:57,800
the null space of a matrix, and remember the null space of a matrix is just the set of

5138
07:19:57,800 --> 07:20:05,720
solutions to the homogeneous system involving that matrix, and so if you look at this system,

5139
07:20:05,720 --> 07:20:10,960
you're solving to find the eigenvectors, you can see it's a homogeneous system, so

5140
07:20:10,960 --> 07:20:20,080
the set of solutions to this will be elements of the null space, or actually will comprise

5141
07:20:20,080 --> 07:20:30,080
the null space of a minus lambda i, and we give that space, since it's associated with

5142
07:20:30,080 --> 07:20:36,440
finding eigenvectors, we give it a special name and call it the eigenspace of A. So

5143
07:20:36,440 --> 07:20:42,600
the eigenspace of A corresponding to the eigenvalue lambda is just the null space of

5144
07:20:42,600 --> 07:20:50,280
a minus lambda i, right, set of all solutions to this system, a minus lambda i times x equals

5145
07:20:50,280 --> 07:20:53,640
zero.

5146
07:20:53,640 --> 07:21:00,200
So the eigenspace of A corresponding to lambda consists of the zero vector, because that's

5147
07:21:00,200 --> 07:21:09,960
in every null space, and all eigenvectors of a minus lambda i.

5148
07:21:09,960 --> 07:21:16,360
Therefore a basis for the eigenspace of A corresponding to lambda is the same as a basis

5149
07:21:16,360 --> 07:21:20,200
for the null space of a minus lambda i.

5150
07:21:21,200 --> 07:21:25,320
Okay, let's look at another example.

5151
07:21:25,320 --> 07:21:32,120
Let's find all the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of this matrix A. So we start off to find

5152
07:21:32,120 --> 07:21:41,960
the eigenvalues, take the determinant of A minus lambda i, and here it gets a little

5153
07:21:41,960 --> 07:21:47,360
complicated because it's got a three by three, so we have to expand about one of the rows

5154
07:21:47,360 --> 07:21:48,440
or columns.

5155
07:21:48,440 --> 07:21:54,640
I expanded about the first column, and so we get negative four minus lambda times the

5156
07:21:54,640 --> 07:22:00,120
determinant of this two by two matrix here, which that's what you see right here.

5157
07:22:00,120 --> 07:22:05,200
Then it's, since this is a plus position, next be minus, so that's where the minus six

5158
07:22:05,200 --> 07:22:11,120
comes from, and then it's the matrix that you get when you delete that second row in

5159
07:22:11,120 --> 07:22:12,640
the first column.

5160
07:22:12,640 --> 07:22:18,840
So we get this, and then it's a minus term, so the next one's plus, so I get plus six

5161
07:22:18,840 --> 07:22:26,880
times this little two by two sitting up here in the upper right corner.

5162
07:22:26,880 --> 07:22:32,200
And then it's just algebra, you know, take these two by two determinants, do some algebra,

5163
07:22:32,200 --> 07:22:42,520
oops, there we go, and we end up with this cubic function, which makes sense because

5164
07:22:42,520 --> 07:22:51,040
three by three matrix, and we end up being able to rewrite it like this, negative lambda

5165
07:22:51,040 --> 07:22:58,080
times lambda minus two squared equals zero, and so clearly lambda equals zero is a solution

5166
07:22:58,080 --> 07:23:01,360
and lambda equals two is a solution.

5167
07:23:01,360 --> 07:23:08,440
Now in this case, since it's lambda minus two squared, the eigenvalue two actually occurs

5168
07:23:08,440 --> 07:23:11,760
twice because it's a solution twice here.

5169
07:23:11,760 --> 07:23:18,600
So we say that lambda equals two has multiplicity two, that means it occurs two times.

5170
07:23:18,600 --> 07:23:23,520
Lambda equals zero, it only occurs once, so it has multiplicity one.

5171
07:23:23,520 --> 07:23:30,960
All right, then we need to do the same process as before to find the eigenvectors.

5172
07:23:30,960 --> 07:23:36,480
So for lambda equals zero, we need to solve a minus zero times the identity times x equals

5173
07:23:36,480 --> 07:23:38,480
zero.

5174
07:23:38,480 --> 07:23:47,760
So in this case, a minus lambda i is just a, so we set up the homogeneous system and

5175
07:23:47,760 --> 07:23:55,040
get that matrix into reduced echelon form, and here's the solution, so we write that

5176
07:23:55,040 --> 07:24:05,480
in parametric vector form, and so any multiple of negative one one one would be an eigenvector

5177
07:24:05,480 --> 07:24:09,440
associated with lambda equals zero.

5178
07:24:09,440 --> 07:24:17,720
Okay, then we move on to the next eigenvalue, which is two, so we solve a minus two i times

5179
07:24:17,720 --> 07:24:26,040
x equals zero, and so compute a minus two i, then set up the homogeneous system and

5180
07:24:26,040 --> 07:24:32,080
get it in reduced echelon form, and notice here that we've got two free variables, and

5181
07:24:32,200 --> 07:24:38,880
so we're going to end up with two linearly independent eigenvectors here, and sometimes

5182
07:24:38,880 --> 07:24:46,400
that happens because remember lambda equals two was an eigenvalue that occurred twice,

5183
07:24:46,400 --> 07:24:52,720
had multiplicity two, and so sometimes in that case, you end up with two linearly independent

5184
07:24:52,720 --> 07:24:55,880
eigenvectors, sometimes only one.

5185
07:24:55,880 --> 07:25:00,880
In this case, we're going to have two because we have two free variables.

5186
07:25:00,880 --> 07:25:11,400
So the solution looks like this, every eigenvector of a associated with lambda equals two is

5187
07:25:11,400 --> 07:25:20,320
a linear combination of these two vectors, and clearly they are linearly independent.

5188
07:25:20,320 --> 07:25:27,880
So to review this problem we've just looked at, here's our matrix a, eigenvalues were

5189
07:25:27,880 --> 07:25:34,880
zero and two, for lambda equals zero we ended up with one eigenvector, lambda equals two,

5190
07:25:34,880 --> 07:25:41,320
we've got two linearly independent eigenvectors, now clearly any multiple of this one is an

5191
07:25:41,320 --> 07:25:46,720
eigenvector associated with lambda equals zero, and any linear combination of these

5192
07:25:46,720 --> 07:25:52,720
two is an eigenvector associated with lambda equals two, but we're really concerned about

5193
07:25:52,720 --> 07:25:58,880
how many linearly independent eigenvectors we have, and so from lambda equals zero we

5194
07:25:58,880 --> 07:26:04,680
got one, from lambda equals two we got two, right?

5195
07:26:04,680 --> 07:26:11,040
So we can say that the vector negative one, one, one is a basis for the eigenspace of

5196
07:26:11,040 --> 07:26:19,600
a associated with lambda equals zero, similarly these other two vectors would form a basis

5197
07:26:19,720 --> 07:26:25,840
for the eigenspace of a associated with lambda equals two.

5198
07:26:25,840 --> 07:26:34,120
Alright, this brings us to a theorem which says if v1 through vr are eigenvectors that

5199
07:26:34,120 --> 07:26:40,400
correspond to distinct eigenvalues, lambda one through lambda r, of an n by n matrix

5200
07:26:40,400 --> 07:26:46,440
a, then the set v1 through vr is linearly independent.

5201
07:26:46,440 --> 07:26:52,800
I'm going to put in a little simpler terms, this just says eigenvectors that come from

5202
07:26:52,800 --> 07:27:00,240
different eigenvalues are linearly independent, eigenvectors that come from different eigenvalues

5203
07:27:00,240 --> 07:27:03,240
are linearly independent.

5204
07:27:03,240 --> 07:27:09,920
So from our previous example, this first one came from a different eigenvalue from the

5205
07:27:09,920 --> 07:27:16,480
second two, so we know that this set is linearly independent, right?

5206
07:27:16,480 --> 07:27:22,520
Because the latter two came from the same eigenvalue, but they were linearly independent,

5207
07:27:22,520 --> 07:27:28,120
we knew that from before, and then when you throw in this other one that came from the

5208
07:27:28,120 --> 07:27:32,800
other eigenvalue, we know that this set is linearly independent because of the theorem,

5209
07:27:32,800 --> 07:27:37,480
because they came from different, the first one and the second two came from different

5210
07:27:37,840 --> 07:27:39,840
eigenvalues.

5211
07:27:39,840 --> 07:27:46,840
Alright, we're going to hit that a little bit more in the next section, but we'll leave

5212
07:27:46,840 --> 07:27:49,200
it at that for right now.

5213
07:27:49,200 --> 07:27:54,680
And I just want to talk about a little easier problem, okay?

5214
07:27:54,680 --> 07:27:59,080
What we've done so far is just taken, basically done the hard problem.

5215
07:27:59,080 --> 07:28:02,600
Here's a matrix, find all the eigenvalues and eigenvectors.

5216
07:28:02,600 --> 07:28:09,600
But sometimes, you just want to know if a given vector is an eigenvector of a matrix,

5217
07:28:10,520 --> 07:28:14,520
and that is a much easier problem, okay?

5218
07:28:14,520 --> 07:28:19,960
So suppose we just want to know if this vector x, given here, is an eigenvector of the matrix

5219
07:28:19,960 --> 07:28:22,460
a.

5220
07:28:22,460 --> 07:28:28,460
For this, go back to the original equation and think, does ax equal lambda x?

5221
07:28:28,860 --> 07:28:32,740
Well we can multiply a times x, that's trivial, right?

5222
07:28:32,740 --> 07:28:35,700
And then how would we know if it's an eigenvector?

5223
07:28:35,700 --> 07:28:42,700
Well the result of a times x should be some scalar times x.

5224
07:28:42,700 --> 07:28:48,860
So we multiply a times x, and in this case we get this vector here, and notice that I

5225
07:28:48,860 --> 07:28:55,140
can factor out a negative two, and I end up with negative two times this vector, which

5226
07:28:55,140 --> 07:28:56,820
is the original x.

5227
07:28:56,820 --> 07:29:03,820
So in this case we have ax equals negative two times x, so that means that x is indeed

5228
07:29:03,820 --> 07:29:10,660
an eigenvector of a, and the associated eigenvalue is negative two, okay?

5229
07:29:10,660 --> 07:29:14,980
So we didn't have to solve any systems of equations, or take determinants, or anything

5230
07:29:14,980 --> 07:29:15,980
like that.

5231
07:29:15,980 --> 07:29:22,980
It was just a simple plug it into the basic equation and see if it satisfies it.

5232
07:29:23,700 --> 07:29:30,700
Alright, another similar question is, given a scalar value, check to see if it's an eigenvalue

5233
07:29:34,980 --> 07:29:37,180
of a matrix.

5234
07:29:37,180 --> 07:29:43,100
And again, you don't have to go through the process that we were doing to find the eigenvalues.

5235
07:29:43,100 --> 07:29:48,980
Just to check to see if a number is an eigenvalue, you need only look at the determinant of a

5236
07:29:48,980 --> 07:29:53,500
minus lambda i, where lambda is the value that you're given.

5237
07:29:53,500 --> 07:29:58,860
So in this case, we look at the determinant of a minus three times the identity.

5238
07:29:58,860 --> 07:30:05,860
So we set up that matrix, take its determinant, and in this case we end up with zero, and

5239
07:30:05,860 --> 07:30:12,860
so the determinant of a minus three i is equal to zero, that tells us that three is indeed

5240
07:30:12,860 --> 07:30:14,940
an eigenvalue of a.

5241
07:30:14,940 --> 07:30:18,500
If we didn't get zero, then it wouldn't be an eigenvalue.

5242
07:30:18,500 --> 07:30:23,420
Okay, a little more terminology.

5243
07:30:23,420 --> 07:30:28,540
This expression, the determinant of a minus lambda i, okay, that's what you end up with

5244
07:30:28,540 --> 07:30:35,540
when you are trying to figure out the eigenvalues of a matrix, and we said that you end up with

5245
07:30:36,700 --> 07:30:39,020
a polynomial there.

5246
07:30:39,020 --> 07:30:43,060
It's called the characteristic polynomial of a.

5247
07:30:43,060 --> 07:30:48,420
And when you set it equal to zero, then we call it the characteristic equation of a.

5248
07:30:48,420 --> 07:30:52,980
So the characteristic polynomial is just what you get when you take the determinant, and

5249
07:30:52,980 --> 07:30:57,980
then you set that equal to zero, and we call that the characteristic equation.

5250
07:30:57,980 --> 07:31:04,980
Okay, we have now the final installment of the invertible matrix theorem.

5251
07:31:05,980 --> 07:31:12,980
So, for a's and n by n matrix, a is invertible if and only if zero is not an eigenvalue of

5252
07:31:16,780 --> 07:31:23,780
a, okay, zero is not an eigenvalue of a, and actually it's pretty easy to see that if

5253
07:31:26,060 --> 07:31:29,260
you think about it a little bit.

5254
07:31:29,260 --> 07:31:35,700
The eigenvalue of a satisfies the characteristic equation, which is the determinant of a minus

5255
07:31:35,700 --> 07:31:37,620
lambda equals zero.

5256
07:31:37,620 --> 07:31:42,860
So if zero was an eigenvalue of a, then we'd have the determinant of a minus zero times

5257
07:31:42,860 --> 07:31:49,140
i would be zero, but a minus zero times i is just a, so we would have the determinant

5258
07:31:49,140 --> 07:31:55,140
of a is equal to zero, and that means that a is not invertible, okay, so therefore zero

5259
07:31:55,220 --> 07:32:02,220
can't be an eigenvalue of a if a is invertible.

5260
07:32:03,220 --> 07:32:10,220
Alright, let's talk today about matrix diagonalization.

5261
07:32:15,100 --> 07:32:21,700
First we're going to introduce the concept of a similar matrix, so if a and b are n by

5262
07:32:21,740 --> 07:32:28,740
n matrices, then we say a is similar to b, and also b is similar to a. If there's an invertible

5263
07:32:30,780 --> 07:32:37,780
matrix p such that a is equal to pbp inverse, and we have this theorem, which says if you

5264
07:32:41,580 --> 07:32:47,500
have two matrices which are similar, then they have the same characteristic polynomial

5265
07:32:47,500 --> 07:32:54,420
and hence the same eigenvalues with the same multiplicities. So remember, the characteristic

5266
07:32:54,420 --> 07:33:00,420
polynomial is just the determinant of a minus lambda i, that's the polynomial that you get

5267
07:33:00,420 --> 07:33:07,420
when you're trying to find the eigenvalues of a matrix, so this theorem tells us if

5268
07:33:07,420 --> 07:33:12,220
you have two matrices that are similar, then they have the same characteristic polynomial

5269
07:33:12,220 --> 07:33:19,220
and therefore they're going to have the same eigenvalues. Okay, now why is this of interest?

5270
07:33:19,500 --> 07:33:26,500
Well, think back to our section on Markov chains. We had this sort of equation that

5271
07:33:31,340 --> 07:33:38,340
to get to x1, we multiplied our transition matrix, which I'm calling a here, times the

5272
07:33:38,500 --> 07:33:45,500
previous state vector, so over x1, a times x0, a2 is a times x1 and so forth, x to the

5273
07:33:46,300 --> 07:33:53,300
x sub k is a times x sub k minus 1. Now, we can, if we look at it like this, then to

5274
07:33:57,700 --> 07:34:04,060
find say our state vector at time 10, then you need to find the state vector at time

5275
07:34:04,060 --> 07:34:08,820
9, and to find the one at time 9, you need the one at time 8 and so forth, and so to

5276
07:34:08,820 --> 07:34:15,820
compute x sub 10, you need x1, x2, x3, up through x sub 9. Another way to look at it

5277
07:34:18,100 --> 07:34:25,100
is like this, that we know for instance for x2, that's a times x1, but we know x1 is

5278
07:34:26,220 --> 07:34:33,220
a times x0, so we make that substitution and so we end up with x2 as a squared times x0.

5279
07:34:33,660 --> 07:34:40,660
And similarly, x3 is a cubed times x0. So in general, xk is a to the k times x0. Now,

5280
07:34:43,260 --> 07:34:50,260
unless a to the k is relatively easy to compute, this really doesn't help us. However, if

5281
07:34:52,340 --> 07:34:59,340
a to the k is easy to compute, then we can compute x sub k much more quicker than going

5282
07:35:00,340 --> 07:35:07,340
through and computing all these subsequent state vectors. Alright, so, let's suppose

5283
07:35:10,020 --> 07:35:17,020
that a is similar to a diagonal matrix. That is, a can be written as pdp inverse, where

5284
07:35:18,700 --> 07:35:25,700
p is invertible and d is a diagonal matrix. Now, what does that get for you? Well, just

5285
07:35:26,260 --> 07:35:32,460
look at what happens when you compute a squared. A squared is a times a, and when we substitute

5286
07:35:32,460 --> 07:35:39,460
pdp inverse in for a, we have this. Now, the trick here is to group the p inverse times

5287
07:35:40,180 --> 07:35:44,620
p together. So, I actually got p inverse p right here in the middle. If we group that

5288
07:35:44,620 --> 07:35:51,620
together, that's the identity matrix. And so then we get pd times the identity times

5289
07:35:52,460 --> 07:35:57,620
dp inverse. And of course, anything times the identity is just that anything. And we've

5290
07:35:57,620 --> 07:36:04,620
got d times d, which gives us d squared. So, a squared is pd squared p inverse. How

5291
07:36:05,900 --> 07:36:12,900
about a cubed? A cubed is a squared times a. And so, we take the a squared, we compute

5292
07:36:13,660 --> 07:36:20,660
it up here, plug it in, times a, and do our trick again. Reassociate to get the p inverse

5293
07:36:21,060 --> 07:36:28,060
p together. And we end up with pd cubed p inverse. So, it looks like in general, a to

5294
07:36:28,580 --> 07:36:35,580
the k is p times d to the k p inverse. Now, what good is that? Well, let's look at a diagonal

5295
07:36:38,580 --> 07:36:45,580
matrix. Here's a simple 2 by 2 diagonal matrix. If we compute d squared, then notice that

5296
07:36:46,260 --> 07:36:52,260
we end up with another diagonal matrix. And the entries on the diagonal are just the original

5297
07:36:52,260 --> 07:36:58,140
diagonal entries raised to the second power. So, in this case, we were computing d squared.

5298
07:36:58,140 --> 07:37:05,140
So, these are the original diagonal entries squared. D cubed. We get another diagonal

5299
07:37:05,620 --> 07:37:12,620
matrix. And the entries are the original diagonal entries cubed. So, just looking at this example,

5300
07:37:13,620 --> 07:37:20,620
it appears that it's easy to compute powers of a diagonal matrix. We just raise each diagonal

5301
07:37:20,620 --> 07:37:27,620
entry to whatever power we're trying to compute. So, if a is similar to a diagonal matrix,

5302
07:37:28,020 --> 07:37:35,020
computing powers of a is also easy. So, we say that a square matrix a is said to be diagonalizable

5303
07:37:36,020 --> 07:37:43,020
if a is similar to a diagonal matrix. That is, if a is equal to pdp inverse for some invertible

5304
07:37:47,540 --> 07:37:54,540
matrix p and some diagonal matrix d. Now, here is a very important theorem. This is

5305
07:37:55,540 --> 07:38:02,540
an n by n matrix a is diagonalizable if and only if a has n linearly independent eigenvectors.

5306
07:38:08,940 --> 07:38:15,940
So, a is diagonalizable if it has n linearly independent eigenvectors. And furthermore,

5307
07:38:16,940 --> 07:38:23,940
a equals pdp inverse with d a diagonal matrix if and only if the columns of p are n linearly

5308
07:38:28,260 --> 07:38:34,140
independent eigenvectors of a. So, this theorem not only tells us the condition, a condition

5309
07:38:34,140 --> 07:38:41,140
under which a is diagonalizable, it also tells us how to compute p and d, okay? p is a matrix

5310
07:38:41,140 --> 07:38:48,140
that consists of n linearly independent eigenvectors of a. And continuing on, it says the diagonal

5311
07:38:49,260 --> 07:38:56,260
entries of d are eigenvalues of a that correspond respectively to the eigenvectors in p. So,

5312
07:38:59,140 --> 07:39:06,140
p consists of the eigenvectors, d consists of the eigenvalues on the diagonal. So, p

5313
07:39:12,140 --> 07:39:18,140
let's look at an example. Here is a matrix a. You can recognize this matrix. We looked

5314
07:39:18,140 --> 07:39:25,140
at it in the video on the intro to eigenvalues and eigenvectors. Okay, so is it diagonalizable?

5315
07:39:29,140 --> 07:39:36,140
Well, let's find the eigenvalues. So, we take the determinant of a minus lambda i and we

5316
07:39:37,140 --> 07:39:44,140
end up with lambda minus eight times lambda plus two is our characteristic polynomial.

5317
07:39:45,140 --> 07:39:50,140
We set that equal to zero, and so our eigenvalues are lambda equals eight and lambda equals negative

5318
07:39:50,140 --> 07:39:57,140
two. Now, at this point, we know that a is diagonalizable because a has two distinct eigenvalues.

5319
07:39:58,140 --> 07:40:05,140
So, it's a two by two matrix. It has two distinct eigenvalues. That means since we know that

5320
07:40:11,140 --> 07:40:17,140
distinct eigenvalues give us linearly independent eigenvectors, eigenvectors that come from distinct

5321
07:40:19,140 --> 07:40:26,140
eigenvalues are guaranteed to be linearly independent. And therefore, a is diagonalizable. Now, to find

5322
07:40:28,140 --> 07:40:35,140
p, we have to compute the eigenvectors. We already know what d is. d is a matrix, diagonal matrix,

5323
07:40:36,140 --> 07:40:42,140
with the eigenvalues on the diagonal. So, take lambda equals eight, and we need to solve

5324
07:40:43,140 --> 07:40:50,140
a minus eight times i times x equals a zero vector. And we, so we solve that system and

5325
07:40:51,140 --> 07:40:58,140
we end up with this vector in parametric vector form. So, any multiple of three one is an eigenvector

5326
07:41:01,140 --> 07:41:08,140
of a corresponding to lambda equals eight. So, at this point, we have one column of p. To get the other column,

5327
07:41:09,140 --> 07:41:16,140
we look at the eigenvalue negative two and solve a minus negative two i times x equals

5328
07:41:16,140 --> 07:41:23,140
zero. And here's that. We end up with negative one third one as our eigenvector. So, any

5329
07:41:31,140 --> 07:41:38,140
multiple of that, any nonzero multiple of that would be an eigenvector. And so, I multiply

5330
07:41:39,140 --> 07:41:45,140
by three. Go back to that. I multiplied it by three. And so, I end up with negative one

5331
07:41:46,140 --> 07:41:53,140
three for our second eigenvector. So, the three one came from lambda equals eight. Negative

5332
07:41:54,140 --> 07:42:00,140
one three came from lambda equals negative two. And so, d consists of the eigenvalues. And the order

5333
07:42:01,140 --> 07:42:08,140
that you put the eigenvectors into p is not important. However, once you establish an order, you

5334
07:42:09,140 --> 07:42:15,140
have to hold that true for both p and d. So, the eigenvector here three one came from lambda equals eight.

5335
07:42:18,140 --> 07:42:24,140
So, we need the eigenvalue eight in the first column of d. And then the eigenvector in the second column

5336
07:42:25,140 --> 07:42:32,140
of p should correspond to the eigenvalue in the second column of d. All right. And then,

5337
07:42:33,140 --> 07:42:40,140
if we want to just check our work, we multiply pdp inverse. And we end up with a. Go through

5338
07:42:44,140 --> 07:42:50,140
that computation and you end up with a. So, pdp inverse is equal to a. Let's look at another

5339
07:42:51,140 --> 07:42:58,140
example. Here's another matrix three by three in this case. And we want to know if it is diagonalizable.

5340
07:43:00,140 --> 07:43:07,140
So, as before, we find its eigenvalues by looking at the determinant of a minus lambda i. We end

5341
07:43:10,140 --> 07:43:17,140
up with this polynomial, negative lambda times lambda minus two squared equals zero. So, we

5342
07:43:20,140 --> 07:43:27,140
find that lambda equals two and the solutions will be lambda equals zero and lambda equals

5343
07:43:28,140 --> 07:43:34,140
two. Now, lambda equals zero occurs once. Lambda equals two occurs twice since it's a

5344
07:43:35,140 --> 07:43:42,140
squared term. So, lambda equals two has multiplicity two. It appears twice as an eigenvalue. Now, at this

5345
07:43:43,140 --> 07:43:50,140
point, we know that a has only two distinct eigenvalues. So, therefore, we don't know if it has three linearly

5346
07:43:54,140 --> 07:44:00,140
independent eigenvectors or not. So, we don't know if a is diagonalizable or not. Just because it doesn't

5347
07:44:01,140 --> 07:44:07,140
have three distinct eigenvalues doesn't mean that it's not diagonalizable. That theory only goes one

5348
07:44:07,140 --> 07:44:16,140
way. If it has indistinct eigenvalues, then it will be diagonalizable. If it doesn't have indistinct

5349
07:44:17,140 --> 07:44:23,140
eigenvalues, you don't know whether it's diagonalizable or not. You have to actually see if you can compute in

5350
07:44:24,140 --> 07:44:31,140
linearly independent eigenvectors. So, in this case, that's what we've got to try. And actually, for this particular

5351
07:44:32,140 --> 07:44:40,140
problem, the real question is whether lambda equals two, which occurred with multiplicity two, will have one or two

5352
07:44:41,140 --> 07:44:50,140
linearly independent eigenvectors. So, let's look at lambda equals two. We solve a minus two i times x equals zero.

5353
07:44:51,140 --> 07:44:59,140
And we end up with, notice in the matrix here, you can see that we've got two free variables. So, therefore, we're

5354
07:45:00,140 --> 07:45:12,140
going to get two linearly independent eigenvectors from this eigenvalue. And so, at this point, we've got two linearly independent

5355
07:45:13,140 --> 07:45:20,140
eigenvectors from lambda equals two. We know we'll get one more from the other eigenvalue. So, at this point, we know that

5356
07:45:21,140 --> 07:45:31,140
a is diagonalizable. And actually, we're two-thirds of the way towards producing the p such that a equals p d p inverse.

5357
07:45:32,140 --> 07:45:41,140
So, we look at the other eigenvalue of zero and solve a minus zero i times x equals zero. Then, notice we've got one free

5358
07:45:41,140 --> 07:45:51,140
variable. So, we end up with one linearly independent eigenvector. And so, we know that a is diagonalizable.

5359
07:45:52,140 --> 07:46:00,140
Here's our eigenvectors that we found. So, we know that a is equal to p d p inverse where p is this matrix.

5360
07:46:01,140 --> 07:46:09,140
Now, notice that the negative one one one came from lambda equals zero. So, that means in the first column of b, I've got zero

5361
07:46:10,140 --> 07:46:20,140
here in the diagonal entry. These last two eigenvectors came from lambda equals two. And so, in the second column and the third column of

5362
07:46:21,140 --> 07:46:32,140
b, I've got two on the diagonal. Now, before, in the two by two example, we actually checked our answer by computing p d p inverse.

5363
07:46:32,140 --> 07:46:41,140
But for three by three, it's not so simple to compute a inverse. And if you've got a calculator, that's not that bad.

5364
07:46:42,140 --> 07:46:53,140
But if you don't, then there's an easier way to check your answer. And that is to note that if a is equal to p d p inverse,

5365
07:46:53,140 --> 07:47:01,140
if we multiply both sides of that equation by p on the right, then we end up with p inverse times p, which goes away.

5366
07:47:02,140 --> 07:47:11,140
And then we end up on the left-hand side with a times p. So, a p would equal p d. And so, we can compute both those matrices.

5367
07:47:12,140 --> 07:47:20,140
Since it only involves multiplication of matrices, you don't have to find any inverses. So, you can check to see if a p is equal to p d.

5368
07:47:20,140 --> 07:47:31,140
So, if we compute both of those, you can see that in this case, they are indeed the same. And so, we can conclude that our p and d are correct.

5369
07:47:32,140 --> 07:47:40,140
Alright, let's look at one more example. Here's another three by three. We want to know if it is diagonalizable.

5370
07:47:41,140 --> 07:47:54,140
So, we find the eigenvalues. I'm expanding about the first column here when I take the determinant and end up with lambda minus four times lambda plus two squared.

5371
07:47:55,140 --> 07:48:00,140
So, again, I don't have three distinct eigenvalues. I only have two.

5372
07:48:00,140 --> 07:48:08,140
Lambda equals four occurs with multiplicity one. Lambda equals negative two occurs with multiplicity two.

5373
07:48:09,140 --> 07:48:22,140
So, we want to know does lambda equal negative two have or we're going to get two linearly independent eigenvectors out of it.

5374
07:48:23,140 --> 07:48:32,140
And when we solve a minus minus two i times x equals zero, notice that we end up with this matrix in echelon form.

5375
07:48:33,140 --> 07:48:46,140
And so, we only have one free variable. Alright, x three is free. And so, we don't get two linearly independent eigenvectors out of this eigenvalue.

5376
07:48:46,140 --> 07:48:57,140
And so, we only get one. We're only going to get one linearly independent eigenvector from the other eigenvalue, lambda equals four.

5377
07:48:58,140 --> 07:49:02,140
So, that means we're only going to end up with two linearly independent eigenvectors.

5378
07:49:03,140 --> 07:49:07,140
And that means that a is not diagonalizable in this case.

5379
07:49:08,140 --> 07:49:14,140
Okay, so we're into chapter six now and section six point one.

5380
07:49:15,140 --> 07:49:19,140
And let's start off with inner products.

5381
07:49:20,140 --> 07:49:26,140
We've discussed this before, I believe, but we're talking about how to multiply a matrix by a vector.

5382
07:49:27,140 --> 07:49:29,140
But let's hit that again here.

5383
07:49:29,140 --> 07:49:36,140
And so, the inner product is defined on two vectors that have to be the same length.

5384
07:49:37,140 --> 07:49:40,140
So, let's suppose that u and v are vectors in Rn.

5385
07:49:41,140 --> 07:49:54,140
The inner product, also called the dot product of u and v, is given by u one times v one plus u two times v two plus dot dot u n times v n.

5386
07:49:55,140 --> 07:50:01,140
So, we simply match up the elements, corresponding elements, multiply, and then add them all up.

5387
07:50:02,140 --> 07:50:11,140
The notation is indicated here where there's a dot u dot v, and that's where the term dot product came from, just because you normally see it written like that.

5388
07:50:13,140 --> 07:50:19,140
So, for an example, suppose we have these two vectors, u and v, to compute their inner product.

5389
07:50:19,140 --> 07:50:25,140
We just match up elements again, so one times four plus two times five plus three times six.

5390
07:50:26,140 --> 07:50:27,140
And so, we end up with 32.

5391
07:50:27,140 --> 07:50:31,140
So, the inner product of two vectors yields a scalar value.

5392
07:50:34,140 --> 07:50:38,140
Okay, here's some properties of inner products.

5393
07:50:39,140 --> 07:50:49,140
The fourth one, I think, is the most interesting because it discusses the inner product of a vector with itself.

5394
07:50:50,140 --> 07:51:04,140
And if we examine that, you see that u dot u is just u one squared plus u two squared plus dot dot dot plus u n squared.

5395
07:51:04,140 --> 07:51:15,140
So, since we're adding up a bunch of squared terms, then it has to be non-negative.

5396
07:51:16,140 --> 07:51:28,140
And notice that the only way that it can be zero, as it's always going to be greater than or equal to zero, but the only way it can equal zero is if each of these terms is zero.

5397
07:51:28,140 --> 07:51:36,140
And since they're all positive or non-negative, they all have to be zero for the sum to be zero.

5398
07:51:37,140 --> 07:51:47,140
Okay, so u dot u is always greater than or equal to zero, and it equals zero, if and only if u is the zero vector.

5399
07:51:47,140 --> 07:51:53,140
Okay, on to the length of a vector.

5400
07:51:53,140 --> 07:51:58,140
The length of a vector also called the norm of a vector.

5401
07:51:58,140 --> 07:52:07,140
If you go and take more math courses, you might encounter the idea of a norm later on, and there are different types of norms.

5402
07:52:07,140 --> 07:52:09,140
This is just one of them, actually.

5403
07:52:09,140 --> 07:52:15,140
It's called the two norm because we're squaring the entries and then taking the square root.

5404
07:52:16,140 --> 07:52:26,140
Okay, but you see the notation, the double vertical bars indicates length or norm, and it's just the square root of a vector with itself.

5405
07:52:26,140 --> 07:52:33,140
So we know what v dot v is, some of these squares, and so then we just take the square root of that.

5406
07:52:34,140 --> 07:52:39,140
In two dimensions, it's easy to see how this works.

5407
07:52:39,140 --> 07:52:43,140
So we have this vector, the blue one here, let's say it's v1, v2.

5408
07:52:44,140 --> 07:52:52,140
Then we know that this distance here along the x-axis is v1, because that's the first component.

5409
07:52:52,140 --> 07:53:00,140
And we know that the distance vertically is v2, since that's the second component, and we have a right triangle here.

5410
07:53:00,140 --> 07:53:11,140
And so by the Pythagorean theorem, we know that the length of the hypotenuse here, which is the length of v, is square root of v1 squared plus v2 squared.

5411
07:53:12,140 --> 07:53:22,140
So this is clear in two dimensions, and actually the scales, as you see, scales to end dimensions still use the same formula.

5412
07:53:26,140 --> 07:53:31,140
At times, we're interested in finding the distance between two vectors.

5413
07:53:32,140 --> 07:53:41,140
And so we note that in this form, this u and v, and that's equal to the length of the vector u minus v.

5414
07:53:41,140 --> 07:53:43,140
So let's see how that works.

5415
07:53:43,140 --> 07:53:50,140
So here we have a vector u, and here's a vector v, and what we'd like to determine is the distance between u and v.

5416
07:53:50,140 --> 07:53:55,140
So that's the length of this line segment here, the black line segment.

5417
07:53:56,140 --> 07:54:00,140
So let's examine what u minus v looks like.

5418
07:54:00,140 --> 07:54:04,140
Well, that's u plus minus v.

5419
07:54:04,140 --> 07:54:09,140
Okay, so here's minus v down here, u still here.

5420
07:54:09,140 --> 07:54:18,140
And so if we do the parallelogram method to compute u plus negative v, we end up with this vector.

5421
07:54:18,140 --> 07:54:28,140
So here's u minus v right here, and you can see from the picture that it's the same length as this distance between u and v.

5422
07:54:28,140 --> 07:54:36,140
And so that's why we compute the distance between u and v as the length of u minus v.

5423
07:54:37,140 --> 07:54:46,140
All right, we say two vectors are orthogonal to each other if their inner product is zero.

5424
07:54:46,140 --> 07:54:58,140
Orthogonal is, looks like two vectors are orthogonal, means it looks like they're perpendicular.

5425
07:54:58,140 --> 07:55:03,140
As you see here, here's a couple of vectors, two one and three negative six.

5426
07:55:03,140 --> 07:55:06,140
If you take the inner product, you end up with zero.

5427
07:55:06,140 --> 07:55:11,140
And if you look at those plotted, then you see a right angle there.

5428
07:55:11,140 --> 07:55:15,140
So they are orthogonal.

5429
07:55:18,140 --> 07:55:30,140
We say a set is an orthogonal set if you can pull out any two vectors from the set and their inner product is zero.

5430
07:55:30,140 --> 07:55:43,140
Okay, so if I have this set v1, v2, v3, and I want to see if it's an orthogonal set, then I need to compute the inner product of each pair of vectors.

5431
07:55:43,140 --> 07:55:53,140
So start off v1 with v2, and so I get one times negative three plus two times zero plus one times three, and that's zero.

5432
07:55:53,140 --> 07:56:03,140
Then I'll do inner product of v1 with v3, and then v2 with v3, and you see that all of those are zero.

5433
07:56:03,140 --> 07:56:13,140
So that means that the set itself is orthogonal because we took all possible pairs and did inner products and each one of those was zero.
