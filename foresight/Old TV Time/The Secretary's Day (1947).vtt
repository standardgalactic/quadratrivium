00:00.000 --> 00:23.900
The modern world is a world in which business plays an important part.

00:23.900 --> 00:29.300
Office buildings and office workers are a familiar site and free city and town.

00:29.300 --> 00:37.300
So is the office secretary, that alert, efficient person who plays such a vital role in the world of business.

00:37.300 --> 00:39.300
This is Jean Carroll.

00:39.300 --> 00:44.300
Her day begins at nine o'clock and she's at her desk on time.

00:44.300 --> 00:47.300
Promptness, neatness, orderliness.

00:47.300 --> 00:52.300
In her first minute, Jean has displayed these attributes of a good secretary.

00:52.300 --> 00:55.300
Office supplies are the tools with which Jean works.

00:55.300 --> 01:02.300
The orderly arrangement of her desk permits a quick check to see that she has enough supplies on hand for the day.

01:02.300 --> 01:07.300
She takes out only those things she knows she needs.

01:07.300 --> 01:16.300
With her place of business in order, she helps to organize the day for herself and her employer by referring to her invaluable calendar pad.

01:16.300 --> 01:20.300
And from it, typing up the daily appointment sheet.

01:20.300 --> 01:25.300
This record indicates the names of various people who have appointments for the day.

01:25.300 --> 01:34.300
It also lists memorandums or personal reminders for her employer.

01:34.300 --> 01:39.300
The record is placed in Mr. Williams' desk before he arrives.

01:39.300 --> 01:46.300
The new arrival is Marge Quinn, office stenographer and Jean's co-worker.

01:46.300 --> 01:52.300
Now, let's clear up this distinction between a stenographer and a secretary.

01:52.300 --> 01:56.300
A stenographer takes dictation, transcribes and types.

01:56.300 --> 02:06.300
She may also do billing and filing and operate office machines such as a duplicator or calculator or transcribing machine.

02:06.300 --> 02:13.300
At time, she may also operate the switchboard.

02:13.300 --> 02:23.300
A secretary assumes much more responsibility than a stenographer and performs many duties that contribute to the success of the company as we shall see.

02:23.300 --> 02:30.300
The calendar pad helps Jean to keep track of her many responsibilities and to establish a regular schedule.

02:30.300 --> 02:34.300
At about the same time each day, the morning mail is distributed.

02:34.300 --> 02:39.300
Sorting it is one of Jean's responsibilities.

02:39.300 --> 02:46.300
She selects the unopened personal letters for Mr. Williams from the business mail which was opened in the mail room.

02:46.300 --> 02:50.300
Mr. Williams has instructed her to open all his personal mail.

02:50.300 --> 02:59.300
The care and precision with which she handles this routine assignment are again indicative of Jean's thoroughly competent approach to her job.

03:10.300 --> 03:22.300
This takes a little longer than simply zipping the letters open, but it minimizes the dangers of tearing the contents or accidentally throwing away a loose enclosure.

03:22.300 --> 03:29.300
And of course, enclosures are no longer loose after they've passed through Jean's hands.

03:29.300 --> 03:35.300
In checking through the business mail, she finds a letter which refers to some previous correspondence.

03:35.300 --> 03:40.300
So she gets out the file on this, in case Mr. Williams might want it later.

03:40.300 --> 03:45.300
And now the mail is in order.

03:45.300 --> 03:46.300
Good morning, Myrds.

03:46.300 --> 03:47.300
Good morning, Mr. Williams.

03:47.300 --> 03:48.300
Good morning, Jean.

03:48.300 --> 03:49.300
Good morning, Mr. Williams.

03:49.300 --> 03:52.300
I want to talk to Mr. Dubois of Philadelphia.

03:52.300 --> 03:55.300
Will you call him for me at eleven o'clock?

03:55.300 --> 03:58.300
Why, yes, of course. That's Peter Dubois, isn't it?

03:58.300 --> 04:01.300
That's right. And it's very important.

04:01.300 --> 04:07.300
Jean makes a note of Mr. Williams' instructions on her calendar pad.

04:07.300 --> 04:15.300
The good secretary doesn't rely on memory. Jean will make sure that every item here is taken care of today.

04:15.300 --> 04:25.300
Two of them, the itinerary and the checks, can easily be attended to during the morning dictation period.

04:26.300 --> 04:30.300
Mr. Williams usually gives dictation at the same time each morning.

04:30.300 --> 04:33.300
This period is an important part of Jean's daily routine.

04:33.300 --> 04:37.300
She makes sure she has all her materials for taking dictation.

04:37.300 --> 04:43.300
Plus the itinerary, the checks, and the file folder she got out earlier.

04:43.300 --> 04:48.300
Leaving Marge to answer the phone and receive any callers, Jean responds quickly.

04:48.300 --> 04:52.300
She recognizes her responsibility to conserve her employer's time.

04:52.300 --> 04:55.300
It's another essential part of her job.

04:55.300 --> 05:02.300
For all her other duties, taking dictation and transcribing her notes is Jean's most important responsibility,

05:02.300 --> 05:07.300
the foundation of secretarial skill.

05:07.300 --> 05:12.300
During the dictation period, Mr. Williams often takes up other questions of the day,

05:12.300 --> 05:16.300
makes suggestions, and gives impromptu instructions.

05:16.300 --> 05:21.300
The secretary too uses this period to clarify any matters that need attention,

05:21.300 --> 05:24.300
so that she need not bother him later.

05:24.300 --> 05:27.300
Foresight, such as bringing the file which she thought he would need.

05:27.300 --> 05:34.300
Dependability in attending to many personal and business details, such as making sure he signs checks.

05:34.300 --> 05:39.300
These are qualities which make the secretary a real asset to her employer.

05:45.300 --> 05:47.300
There you are.

05:47.300 --> 05:50.300
Now about this itinerary for my trip to Toronto.

05:50.300 --> 05:53.300
I've decided to stop off at Cleveland on my way back.

05:53.300 --> 05:55.300
That will be on the 28th.

05:55.300 --> 05:58.300
Can you rearrange this to allow me a day there?

05:58.300 --> 06:01.300
Very well. I'll check on hotel and train reservations.

06:01.300 --> 06:04.300
I think that will be all for now, Jean.

06:04.300 --> 06:08.300
Oh, by the way, I saw Mr. Carl.

06:08.300 --> 06:10.300
He won't be in this afternoon.

06:10.300 --> 06:14.300
Make his appointment for 9 o'clock tomorrow morning.

06:20.300 --> 06:25.300
Jean leaves the office without delay.

06:25.300 --> 06:28.300
Now she can revise her schedule and bring it up to date.

06:28.300 --> 06:33.300
On the calendar pad, she checks off the items that have been taken care of.

06:33.300 --> 06:36.300
The appointment with Mr. Carl is cancelled.

06:36.300 --> 06:39.300
It becomes the first item on the next day's schedule.

06:39.300 --> 06:45.300
For organizing her work is a continuing process from day to day and week to week.

06:50.300 --> 06:55.300
The checks have been signed and the itinerary must be revised.

06:55.300 --> 07:00.300
The itinerary is a schedule of times and places that make up a trip.

07:04.300 --> 07:10.300
A hotel guide will supply the information Jean needs to arrange for Mr. Williams to stay overnight in Cleveland.

07:13.300 --> 07:18.300
Knowing where to look for information and how to use it is part of Jean's job.

07:21.300 --> 07:26.300
The secretary should be familiar with standard reference books like these.

07:31.300 --> 07:35.300
By mid-morning, Jean is well along with her transcribing.

07:35.300 --> 07:38.300
This period is another part of her varied day.

07:38.300 --> 07:44.300
But she is also receptionist to customers, friends, job applicants and salesmen.

07:44.300 --> 07:48.300
Jean knows how her employer wants her to handle these different kinds of callers.

07:48.300 --> 07:53.300
In every case, she is tactful, courteous and poised.

07:53.300 --> 07:58.300
Since she cannot admit this salesman now, she makes an appointment for him for the next morning.

07:58.300 --> 08:04.300
The secretary's manner of handling callers directly influences their attitude toward the business.

08:06.300 --> 08:12.300
The unexpected caller receives this courteous treatment as does Mr. Richards, who has an appointment.

08:12.300 --> 08:17.300
Callers, whether expected or not, usually interrupt other work.

08:17.300 --> 08:21.300
But Jean loses no time getting back to her organized routine.

08:24.300 --> 08:26.300
Call Peter DuBois.

08:26.300 --> 08:31.300
Yes, proper use of the telephone is another must for a good secretary.

08:32.300 --> 08:34.300
Long distance, please.

08:36.300 --> 08:39.300
I want Philadelphia Quaker 1200.

08:39.300 --> 08:41.300
Mr. Peter DuBois.

08:41.300 --> 08:45.300
The last name is spelled D-U-B-O-I-S.

08:45.300 --> 08:49.300
Mr. Arthur J. Williams at Center 9000 is calling.

08:49.300 --> 08:55.300
Not only does the secretary maintain a pleasant relationship with her employer and his business associates,

08:55.300 --> 09:03.300
but she must be able to get along with her coworkers and occasionally give instructions to subordinates and supervise their work.

09:03.300 --> 09:08.300
Jean is able to tell others what to do because she knows from experience what is required.

09:08.300 --> 09:15.300
Having been a general office worker before she became a secretary, she's familiar with other phases of office work,

09:15.300 --> 09:18.300
and she's always willing to help a fellow worker.

09:18.300 --> 09:23.300
Consideration for others is an important factor in good office manners.

09:24.300 --> 09:30.300
Jean has carried through her daily routine very thoroughly and has kept up with her schedule.

09:30.300 --> 09:37.300
As a result, even a late interruption, like an unexpected call for dictation, can be handled smoothly.

09:37.300 --> 09:41.300
In this office, there's no frantic last-minute rush to wind up the day's work.

09:42.300 --> 09:45.300
Jean is still at top efficiency.

09:45.300 --> 09:50.300
Even under pressure of getting out a last-minute letter, she is calm and courteous.

09:52.300 --> 09:58.300
Goodwill and understanding are part of her personality, part of her job.

09:59.300 --> 10:05.300
Now, with the rush letter transcribed and signed, she winds up her day in a neat, orderly manner.

10:06.300 --> 10:09.300
The routine of one day carries over into the next.

10:09.300 --> 10:14.300
Before Jean leaves, she has a clear picture of what she is going to do tomorrow.

10:16.300 --> 10:19.300
Alert, personable, efficient.

10:19.300 --> 10:24.300
Our secretary leaves at the end of the day with a sense of accomplishment

10:24.300 --> 10:31.300
and of pride in her contribution to the world of business, in which she plays such an important part.
