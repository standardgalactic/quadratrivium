1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:23,900
The modern world is a world in which business plays an important part.

2
00:00:23,900 --> 00:00:29,300
Office buildings and office workers are a familiar site and free city and town.

3
00:00:29,300 --> 00:00:37,300
So is the office secretary, that alert, efficient person who plays such a vital role in the world of business.

4
00:00:37,300 --> 00:00:39,300
This is Jean Carroll.

5
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:44,300
Her day begins at nine o'clock and she's at her desk on time.

6
00:00:44,300 --> 00:00:47,300
Promptness, neatness, orderliness.

7
00:00:47,300 --> 00:00:52,300
In her first minute, Jean has displayed these attributes of a good secretary.

8
00:00:52,300 --> 00:00:55,300
Office supplies are the tools with which Jean works.

9
00:00:55,300 --> 00:01:02,300
The orderly arrangement of her desk permits a quick check to see that she has enough supplies on hand for the day.

10
00:01:02,300 --> 00:01:07,300
She takes out only those things she knows she needs.

11
00:01:07,300 --> 00:01:16,300
With her place of business in order, she helps to organize the day for herself and her employer by referring to her invaluable calendar pad.

12
00:01:16,300 --> 00:01:20,300
And from it, typing up the daily appointment sheet.

13
00:01:20,300 --> 00:01:25,300
This record indicates the names of various people who have appointments for the day.

14
00:01:25,300 --> 00:01:34,300
It also lists memorandums or personal reminders for her employer.

15
00:01:34,300 --> 00:01:39,300
The record is placed in Mr. Williams' desk before he arrives.

16
00:01:39,300 --> 00:01:46,300
The new arrival is Marge Quinn, office stenographer and Jean's co-worker.

17
00:01:46,300 --> 00:01:52,300
Now, let's clear up this distinction between a stenographer and a secretary.

18
00:01:52,300 --> 00:01:56,300
A stenographer takes dictation, transcribes and types.

19
00:01:56,300 --> 00:02:06,300
She may also do billing and filing and operate office machines such as a duplicator or calculator or transcribing machine.

20
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:13,300
At time, she may also operate the switchboard.

21
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:23,300
A secretary assumes much more responsibility than a stenographer and performs many duties that contribute to the success of the company as we shall see.

22
00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:30,300
The calendar pad helps Jean to keep track of her many responsibilities and to establish a regular schedule.

23
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:34,300
At about the same time each day, the morning mail is distributed.

24
00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:39,300
Sorting it is one of Jean's responsibilities.

25
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:46,300
She selects the unopened personal letters for Mr. Williams from the business mail which was opened in the mail room.

26
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:50,300
Mr. Williams has instructed her to open all his personal mail.

27
00:02:50,300 --> 00:02:59,300
The care and precision with which she handles this routine assignment are again indicative of Jean's thoroughly competent approach to her job.

28
00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:22,300
This takes a little longer than simply zipping the letters open, but it minimizes the dangers of tearing the contents or accidentally throwing away a loose enclosure.

29
00:03:22,300 --> 00:03:29,300
And of course, enclosures are no longer loose after they've passed through Jean's hands.

30
00:03:29,300 --> 00:03:35,300
In checking through the business mail, she finds a letter which refers to some previous correspondence.

31
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:40,300
So she gets out the file on this, in case Mr. Williams might want it later.

32
00:03:40,300 --> 00:03:45,300
And now the mail is in order.

33
00:03:45,300 --> 00:03:46,300
Good morning, Myrds.

34
00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:47,300
Good morning, Mr. Williams.

35
00:03:47,300 --> 00:03:48,300
Good morning, Jean.

36
00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:49,300
Good morning, Mr. Williams.

37
00:03:49,300 --> 00:03:52,300
I want to talk to Mr. Dubois of Philadelphia.

38
00:03:52,300 --> 00:03:55,300
Will you call him for me at eleven o'clock?

39
00:03:55,300 --> 00:03:58,300
Why, yes, of course. That's Peter Dubois, isn't it?

40
00:03:58,300 --> 00:04:01,300
That's right. And it's very important.

41
00:04:01,300 --> 00:04:07,300
Jean makes a note of Mr. Williams' instructions on her calendar pad.

42
00:04:07,300 --> 00:04:15,300
The good secretary doesn't rely on memory. Jean will make sure that every item here is taken care of today.

43
00:04:15,300 --> 00:04:25,300
Two of them, the itinerary and the checks, can easily be attended to during the morning dictation period.

44
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:30,300
Mr. Williams usually gives dictation at the same time each morning.

45
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:33,300
This period is an important part of Jean's daily routine.

46
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:37,300
She makes sure she has all her materials for taking dictation.

47
00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:43,300
Plus the itinerary, the checks, and the file folder she got out earlier.

48
00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:48,300
Leaving Marge to answer the phone and receive any callers, Jean responds quickly.

49
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:52,300
She recognizes her responsibility to conserve her employer's time.

50
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:55,300
It's another essential part of her job.

51
00:04:55,300 --> 00:05:02,300
For all her other duties, taking dictation and transcribing her notes is Jean's most important responsibility,

52
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:07,300
the foundation of secretarial skill.

53
00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:12,300
During the dictation period, Mr. Williams often takes up other questions of the day,

54
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:16,300
makes suggestions, and gives impromptu instructions.

55
00:05:16,300 --> 00:05:21,300
The secretary too uses this period to clarify any matters that need attention,

56
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:24,300
so that she need not bother him later.

57
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:27,300
Foresight, such as bringing the file which she thought he would need.

58
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:34,300
Dependability in attending to many personal and business details, such as making sure he signs checks.

59
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:39,300
These are qualities which make the secretary a real asset to her employer.

60
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:47,300
There you are.

61
00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:50,300
Now about this itinerary for my trip to Toronto.

62
00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:53,300
I've decided to stop off at Cleveland on my way back.

63
00:05:53,300 --> 00:05:55,300
That will be on the 28th.

64
00:05:55,300 --> 00:05:58,300
Can you rearrange this to allow me a day there?

65
00:05:58,300 --> 00:06:01,300
Very well. I'll check on hotel and train reservations.

66
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:04,300
I think that will be all for now, Jean.

67
00:06:04,300 --> 00:06:08,300
Oh, by the way, I saw Mr. Carl.

68
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:10,300
He won't be in this afternoon.

69
00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:14,300
Make his appointment for 9 o'clock tomorrow morning.

70
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:25,300
Jean leaves the office without delay.

71
00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:28,300
Now she can revise her schedule and bring it up to date.

72
00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:33,300
On the calendar pad, she checks off the items that have been taken care of.

73
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:36,300
The appointment with Mr. Carl is cancelled.

74
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:39,300
It becomes the first item on the next day's schedule.

75
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:45,300
For organizing her work is a continuing process from day to day and week to week.

76
00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:55,300
The checks have been signed and the itinerary must be revised.

77
00:06:55,300 --> 00:07:00,300
The itinerary is a schedule of times and places that make up a trip.

78
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:10,300
A hotel guide will supply the information Jean needs to arrange for Mr. Williams to stay overnight in Cleveland.

79
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:18,300
Knowing where to look for information and how to use it is part of Jean's job.

80
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:26,300
The secretary should be familiar with standard reference books like these.

81
00:07:31,300 --> 00:07:35,300
By mid-morning, Jean is well along with her transcribing.

82
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:38,300
This period is another part of her varied day.

83
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:44,300
But she is also receptionist to customers, friends, job applicants and salesmen.

84
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:48,300
Jean knows how her employer wants her to handle these different kinds of callers.

85
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:53,300
In every case, she is tactful, courteous and poised.

86
00:07:53,300 --> 00:07:58,300
Since she cannot admit this salesman now, she makes an appointment for him for the next morning.

87
00:07:58,300 --> 00:08:04,300
The secretary's manner of handling callers directly influences their attitude toward the business.

88
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:12,300
The unexpected caller receives this courteous treatment as does Mr. Richards, who has an appointment.

89
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:17,300
Callers, whether expected or not, usually interrupt other work.

90
00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:21,300
But Jean loses no time getting back to her organized routine.

91
00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:26,300
Call Peter DuBois.

92
00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:31,300
Yes, proper use of the telephone is another must for a good secretary.

93
00:08:32,300 --> 00:08:34,300
Long distance, please.

94
00:08:36,300 --> 00:08:39,300
I want Philadelphia Quaker 1200.

95
00:08:39,300 --> 00:08:41,300
Mr. Peter DuBois.

96
00:08:41,300 --> 00:08:45,300
The last name is spelled D-U-B-O-I-S.

97
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:49,300
Mr. Arthur J. Williams at Center 9000 is calling.

98
00:08:49,300 --> 00:08:55,300
Not only does the secretary maintain a pleasant relationship with her employer and his business associates,

99
00:08:55,300 --> 00:09:03,300
but she must be able to get along with her coworkers and occasionally give instructions to subordinates and supervise their work.

100
00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:08,300
Jean is able to tell others what to do because she knows from experience what is required.

101
00:09:08,300 --> 00:09:15,300
Having been a general office worker before she became a secretary, she's familiar with other phases of office work,

102
00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:18,300
and she's always willing to help a fellow worker.

103
00:09:18,300 --> 00:09:23,300
Consideration for others is an important factor in good office manners.

104
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:30,300
Jean has carried through her daily routine very thoroughly and has kept up with her schedule.

105
00:09:30,300 --> 00:09:37,300
As a result, even a late interruption, like an unexpected call for dictation, can be handled smoothly.

106
00:09:37,300 --> 00:09:41,300
In this office, there's no frantic last-minute rush to wind up the day's work.

107
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:45,300
Jean is still at top efficiency.

108
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:50,300
Even under pressure of getting out a last-minute letter, she is calm and courteous.

109
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:58,300
Goodwill and understanding are part of her personality, part of her job.

110
00:09:59,300 --> 00:10:05,300
Now, with the rush letter transcribed and signed, she winds up her day in a neat, orderly manner.

111
00:10:06,300 --> 00:10:09,300
The routine of one day carries over into the next.

112
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:14,300
Before Jean leaves, she has a clear picture of what she is going to do tomorrow.

113
00:10:16,300 --> 00:10:19,300
Alert, personable, efficient.

114
00:10:19,300 --> 00:10:24,300
Our secretary leaves at the end of the day with a sense of accomplishment

115
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:31,300
and of pride in her contribution to the world of business, in which she plays such an important part.
