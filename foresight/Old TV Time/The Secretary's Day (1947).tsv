0	23900	The modern world is a world in which business plays an important part.
23900	29300	Office buildings and office workers are a familiar site and free city and town.
29300	37300	So is the office secretary, that alert, efficient person who plays such a vital role in the world of business.
37300	39300	This is Jean Carroll.
39300	44300	Her day begins at nine o'clock and she's at her desk on time.
44300	47300	Promptness, neatness, orderliness.
47300	52300	In her first minute, Jean has displayed these attributes of a good secretary.
52300	55300	Office supplies are the tools with which Jean works.
55300	62300	The orderly arrangement of her desk permits a quick check to see that she has enough supplies on hand for the day.
62300	67300	She takes out only those things she knows she needs.
67300	76300	With her place of business in order, she helps to organize the day for herself and her employer by referring to her invaluable calendar pad.
76300	80300	And from it, typing up the daily appointment sheet.
80300	85300	This record indicates the names of various people who have appointments for the day.
85300	94300	It also lists memorandums or personal reminders for her employer.
94300	99300	The record is placed in Mr. Williams' desk before he arrives.
99300	106300	The new arrival is Marge Quinn, office stenographer and Jean's co-worker.
106300	112300	Now, let's clear up this distinction between a stenographer and a secretary.
112300	116300	A stenographer takes dictation, transcribes and types.
116300	126300	She may also do billing and filing and operate office machines such as a duplicator or calculator or transcribing machine.
126300	133300	At time, she may also operate the switchboard.
133300	143300	A secretary assumes much more responsibility than a stenographer and performs many duties that contribute to the success of the company as we shall see.
143300	150300	The calendar pad helps Jean to keep track of her many responsibilities and to establish a regular schedule.
150300	154300	At about the same time each day, the morning mail is distributed.
154300	159300	Sorting it is one of Jean's responsibilities.
159300	166300	She selects the unopened personal letters for Mr. Williams from the business mail which was opened in the mail room.
166300	170300	Mr. Williams has instructed her to open all his personal mail.
170300	179300	The care and precision with which she handles this routine assignment are again indicative of Jean's thoroughly competent approach to her job.
190300	202300	This takes a little longer than simply zipping the letters open, but it minimizes the dangers of tearing the contents or accidentally throwing away a loose enclosure.
202300	209300	And of course, enclosures are no longer loose after they've passed through Jean's hands.
209300	215300	In checking through the business mail, she finds a letter which refers to some previous correspondence.
215300	220300	So she gets out the file on this, in case Mr. Williams might want it later.
220300	225300	And now the mail is in order.
225300	226300	Good morning, Myrds.
226300	227300	Good morning, Mr. Williams.
227300	228300	Good morning, Jean.
228300	229300	Good morning, Mr. Williams.
229300	232300	I want to talk to Mr. Dubois of Philadelphia.
232300	235300	Will you call him for me at eleven o'clock?
235300	238300	Why, yes, of course. That's Peter Dubois, isn't it?
238300	241300	That's right. And it's very important.
241300	247300	Jean makes a note of Mr. Williams' instructions on her calendar pad.
247300	255300	The good secretary doesn't rely on memory. Jean will make sure that every item here is taken care of today.
255300	265300	Two of them, the itinerary and the checks, can easily be attended to during the morning dictation period.
266300	270300	Mr. Williams usually gives dictation at the same time each morning.
270300	273300	This period is an important part of Jean's daily routine.
273300	277300	She makes sure she has all her materials for taking dictation.
277300	283300	Plus the itinerary, the checks, and the file folder she got out earlier.
283300	288300	Leaving Marge to answer the phone and receive any callers, Jean responds quickly.
288300	292300	She recognizes her responsibility to conserve her employer's time.
292300	295300	It's another essential part of her job.
295300	302300	For all her other duties, taking dictation and transcribing her notes is Jean's most important responsibility,
302300	307300	the foundation of secretarial skill.
307300	312300	During the dictation period, Mr. Williams often takes up other questions of the day,
312300	316300	makes suggestions, and gives impromptu instructions.
316300	321300	The secretary too uses this period to clarify any matters that need attention,
321300	324300	so that she need not bother him later.
324300	327300	Foresight, such as bringing the file which she thought he would need.
327300	334300	Dependability in attending to many personal and business details, such as making sure he signs checks.
334300	339300	These are qualities which make the secretary a real asset to her employer.
345300	347300	There you are.
347300	350300	Now about this itinerary for my trip to Toronto.
350300	353300	I've decided to stop off at Cleveland on my way back.
353300	355300	That will be on the 28th.
355300	358300	Can you rearrange this to allow me a day there?
358300	361300	Very well. I'll check on hotel and train reservations.
361300	364300	I think that will be all for now, Jean.
364300	368300	Oh, by the way, I saw Mr. Carl.
368300	370300	He won't be in this afternoon.
370300	374300	Make his appointment for 9 o'clock tomorrow morning.
380300	385300	Jean leaves the office without delay.
385300	388300	Now she can revise her schedule and bring it up to date.
388300	393300	On the calendar pad, she checks off the items that have been taken care of.
393300	396300	The appointment with Mr. Carl is cancelled.
396300	399300	It becomes the first item on the next day's schedule.
399300	405300	For organizing her work is a continuing process from day to day and week to week.
410300	415300	The checks have been signed and the itinerary must be revised.
415300	420300	The itinerary is a schedule of times and places that make up a trip.
424300	430300	A hotel guide will supply the information Jean needs to arrange for Mr. Williams to stay overnight in Cleveland.
433300	438300	Knowing where to look for information and how to use it is part of Jean's job.
441300	446300	The secretary should be familiar with standard reference books like these.
451300	455300	By mid-morning, Jean is well along with her transcribing.
455300	458300	This period is another part of her varied day.
458300	464300	But she is also receptionist to customers, friends, job applicants and salesmen.
464300	468300	Jean knows how her employer wants her to handle these different kinds of callers.
468300	473300	In every case, she is tactful, courteous and poised.
473300	478300	Since she cannot admit this salesman now, she makes an appointment for him for the next morning.
478300	484300	The secretary's manner of handling callers directly influences their attitude toward the business.
486300	492300	The unexpected caller receives this courteous treatment as does Mr. Richards, who has an appointment.
492300	497300	Callers, whether expected or not, usually interrupt other work.
497300	501300	But Jean loses no time getting back to her organized routine.
504300	506300	Call Peter DuBois.
506300	511300	Yes, proper use of the telephone is another must for a good secretary.
512300	514300	Long distance, please.
516300	519300	I want Philadelphia Quaker 1200.
519300	521300	Mr. Peter DuBois.
521300	525300	The last name is spelled D-U-B-O-I-S.
525300	529300	Mr. Arthur J. Williams at Center 9000 is calling.
529300	535300	Not only does the secretary maintain a pleasant relationship with her employer and his business associates,
535300	543300	but she must be able to get along with her coworkers and occasionally give instructions to subordinates and supervise their work.
543300	548300	Jean is able to tell others what to do because she knows from experience what is required.
548300	555300	Having been a general office worker before she became a secretary, she's familiar with other phases of office work,
555300	558300	and she's always willing to help a fellow worker.
558300	563300	Consideration for others is an important factor in good office manners.
564300	570300	Jean has carried through her daily routine very thoroughly and has kept up with her schedule.
570300	577300	As a result, even a late interruption, like an unexpected call for dictation, can be handled smoothly.
577300	581300	In this office, there's no frantic last-minute rush to wind up the day's work.
582300	585300	Jean is still at top efficiency.
585300	590300	Even under pressure of getting out a last-minute letter, she is calm and courteous.
592300	598300	Goodwill and understanding are part of her personality, part of her job.
599300	605300	Now, with the rush letter transcribed and signed, she winds up her day in a neat, orderly manner.
606300	609300	The routine of one day carries over into the next.
609300	614300	Before Jean leaves, she has a clear picture of what she is going to do tomorrow.
616300	619300	Alert, personable, efficient.
619300	624300	Our secretary leaves at the end of the day with a sense of accomplishment
624300	631300	and of pride in her contribution to the world of business, in which she plays such an important part.
