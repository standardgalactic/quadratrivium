0	8560	Good day, grade 12s!
8560	14760	I hope you are ready for the next lesson about the processes used to make fertilizers.
14760	21640	We already saw how distillation is used to extract nitrogen from the air to make ammonia.
21640	26560	This ammonia is then used to make a number of other fertilizers.
26560	32720	Now we will learn about the Haber process in detail and go on to examine the Ostwald
32720	35400	ant contact processes too.
35400	38640	The Haber process is used to form ammonia.
38640	45960	Here, hydrogen is made to react with nitrogen to form ammonia under special conditions.
45960	52280	To ensure economically high yields of ammonia, which will be about 15%.
52280	57960	In order to get an economically high yield of ammonia, a reasonably high pressure of
57960	62800	200 atmospheres is used to favor the forward reaction.
62800	67960	The temperature should be approximately 450 degrees.
67960	73000	But remember, the forward reaction in ammonia production is exothermic.
73000	78080	Therefore, a high temperature actually favors the reverse reaction.
78080	82880	So the high temperature is a compromised temperature between getting an economically
82880	89600	viable maximum yield and an economically viable rate of production of ammonia.
89600	94680	Basically, the high temperature is to quicken the formation of ammonia.
94680	100800	Finally, an iron catalyst is used to speed up the overall reaction, keeping production
100800	102520	costs down.
102520	108120	Now that we know how to get a high yield of ammonia, let's see how this ammonia is
108120	110960	used to produce different fertilizers.
110960	113280	Let's continue with Adrian.
113280	119720	In the next step on the flowchart, ammonia is used to make nitric acid.
119720	123720	This is called the Ostwald process.
123720	127160	There are three chemical reactions in the Ostwald process.
127160	130020	Let's examine each of them in turn.
130020	136260	The first step of the Ostwald process is called the catalytic oxidation of ammonia.
136260	141580	Ammonia reacts with oxygen to form nitrogen monoxide and water.
141580	151580	The balanced chemical equation is 4NH3 plus 502 goes to form 4N0 plus 6H2O.
151580	157500	The reaction is exothermic.
157500	163620	Ammonia and oxygen gas enter a reaction chamber filled with a mesh containing a platinum rhodium
163620	165020	catalyst.
165020	169140	At first, the catalyst is heated to start the process.
169140	174260	Once the reaction begins, it produces enough heat to keep high operating temperatures of
174260	178740	between 800 and 900 degrees Celsius.
178740	184340	The pressure on the gases in the reaction chamber is kept at 3 to 4 atmospheres.
184340	192100	Under these conditions, about 95% of the ammonia is oxidized to nitrogen monoxide.
192100	196700	The second step of the Ostwald process takes place in the same reaction chamber as the
196700	198860	first step.
198860	205060	Nitrogen monoxide from the first step is oxidized to form nitrogen dioxide.
205060	211500	This second step of the Ostwald process is called the oxidation of nitrogen monoxide.
211500	222020	The balanced chemical equation for this reaction is 2NO plus O2 reacts to form 2NO2.
222020	227500	This is also an exothermic reaction.
227500	232740	After the first two steps of the Ostwald process, not all the nitrogen monoxide has converted
232740	238700	to nitrogen dioxide, so the mixture of gases is cooled in a condenser to less than 100
238700	240820	degrees Celsius.
240820	246140	Water vapor formed in the oxidation of ammonia condenses into liquid.
246140	252060	This water absorbs some of the nitrogen dioxide to form nitric acid.
252060	257980	This third step is called the absorption of nitrogen dioxide into water.
257980	270700	The chemical equation is 3NO2 gas plus H2O liquid goes to form 2HNO3 aqueous plus NO gas.
270700	273780	This is also an exothermic reaction.
273780	280860	Unfortunately, a large amount of nitrogen monoxide and nitrogen dioxide remain unreacted
280860	287380	in the condenser, so special distillation towers are used to convert the unreacted gases
287380	290160	into nitric acid.
290160	295540	In the distillation tower, a fine spray of deionized water is released from the top of
295540	296780	the tower.
296780	302700	The unreacted nitrogen dioxide is drawn up from the bottom of the tower and dissolves
302700	304660	in the water.
304660	309460	There are trays arranged around the edges of the tower to collect the solution of nitric
309460	311460	acid that is formed.
311460	317460	But nitrogen monoxide is also formed in this reaction, and remember there is still unreacted
317460	322580	nitrogen monoxide from the initial catalytic oxidation of ammonia.
322580	326700	So how do industrial chemists solve this problem?
326700	332100	Well, they draw oxygen into the bottom of the distillation tower and keep the temperature
332100	338260	of the gases at 50 degrees Celsius and the pressure at 9 to 10 atmospheres.
338260	345180	Under these conditions, the excess nitrogen monoxide oxidizes to form nitrogen dioxide.
345180	351980	The nitrogen dioxide dissolves in the water to form more nitric acid.
351980	357500	Now let's go back to our flow chart to see what happens to the nitric acid.
357500	364100	Nitric acid and ammonia can react together to make ammonium nitrate, which is used as
364100	367620	a nitrogen-based fertilizer.
367620	373820	In the first step of this process, an aqueous solution of ammonium nitrate is formed.
373820	379980	The ammonia liquid neutralizes the acid to form a salt solution.
379980	386760	In the second step, water is evaporated from the solution to form granules of solid ammonium
386760	388260	nitrate.
388260	395920	Finally, once the granules are formed, substances such as magnesium oxide, magnesium nitrate
395920	400420	and calcium oxide are added to them as coatings.
400420	406500	The role of these coatings is to prevent the ammonium nitrate from absorbing too much water.
406500	414500	In a very similar process, ammonia can react with sulfuric acid to form ammonium sulfate,
414500	417140	which is also a useful fertilizer.
417140	426620	The chemical equation for the production of ammonium sulfate is 2NH3 plus H2SO4 goes
426620	435140	to form brackets, NH4 close brackets twice SO4.
435140	438400	There is one final process that we need to examine.
438400	443900	In this process, ammonia is used to produce urea.
443900	447620	Urea is produced on a large scale across the world.
447620	454560	It has a nitrogen content of 46,4 percent, the highest percentage of all common solid
454560	457940	nitrogen-based fertilizers.
457940	462940	Urea is produced by reacting ammonia with carbon dioxide.
462940	468540	There are two steps in the process as shown in these chemical equations.
468540	471580	Let's review the big picture so far.
471580	478660	We start by collecting nitrogen from the atmosphere and then fix it in the harbor process to form
478660	481020	water soluble ammonia.
481020	489700	Next, ammonia is used to make nitric acid and then nitric acid and ammonia are used
489700	495940	in many different processes to make all the nitrogen-containing fertilizers we need.
495940	502020	The Ostward process leads to the formation of nitric acid, which reacts with ammonia
502020	506340	to form a common fertilizer called ammonium nitrate.
506340	512620	The contact process focuses on the formation of sulfuric acid, which reacts with ammonia
512620	516060	to form ammonium sulfate fertilizer.
516060	519620	The other fertilizer that is formed is urea.
519620	524020	This is formed when ammonia reacts with carbon dioxide.
524020	531180	The flow diagram shows the formation of the common nitrogen-based fertilizer we just discussed.
531180	537620	Besides nitrogen-based fertilizers, we also get the phosphate-based fertilizers and potassium-based
537620	539620	ones.
539620	545220	Phosphate-based fertilizers are formed when phosphate rock reacts with sulfuric acid to
545220	548380	form phosphoric acid.
548380	553980	Phosphoric acid reacts with ammonia to form superphosphate fertilizer.
553980	560620	These superphosphates are soluble in water and can be absorbed easily by plants.
560620	567380	The nitrogen-based fertilizers are also soluble in water, making them absorbable too.
567380	573660	Other known fertilizers are those that contain potassium salts, also known as potash, when
573660	576500	used as fertilizer.
576500	586940	Common-based fertilizers include potassium nitrate, KN03, and potassium sulfate K2SO4.
586940	591980	Extensive use of all these forms of fertilizer could have a negative impact on humans and
591980	594300	their environment.
594300	599940	Fertilizers often lead to problems such as nitrogen saturation, groundwater pollution,
599940	603700	deutrophication, and soil acidification.
603700	610220	High concentrations of acid in soil could end up in our water stream and groundwater.
610220	615700	This means there could be a high concentration of nitrates in the water that humans drink.
615700	621580	In humans, a high concentration of nitrate in the body could lead to a shortage of oxygen
621580	624780	in the organs and tissues.
624780	630700	Fertilizers in the body get converted to nitrates by oxidizing iron atoms.
630700	636180	With fewer iron atoms, less oxygen can be carried in the blood.
636180	642060	Shortage of oxygen could be fatal to humans, especially babies and older people.
642060	647860	The same thing can happen to plants, fish, and other animals.
647860	651180	Deutrophication is an excess of nutrients in water.
651180	657940	This is due to over-fertilization, sewage waste, an increase in nutrients in an ecosystem
657940	664660	like nitrogen and phosphate, and burning of fossil fuels such as coal at sassel.
664660	669700	The impact of deutrophication can be seen on land and in water.
669700	674340	And water rapid and excessive growth of algae occurs.
674340	679820	When this algae dies later, it becomes food for bacteria that deplete the oxygen in the
679820	682380	water during respiration.
682380	686500	Fish and other organisms die from low oxygen.
686500	690860	On land, weeds grow at the cost of indigenous plants.
690860	697460	This leads to a change in the diversity of species, thus ecosystems change.
697460	703780	Soil erosion is often a result due to the absence of natural vegetation.
703780	710300	Manure from feedlots and milk stalls can be removed before it runs into surface water.
710300	713860	Manure can be used as organic fertilizer.
713860	717220	In this way, nutrients will be recycled.
717220	723060	The diet of stock animals can be adapted to their needs, so decreasing their excretion
723060	724900	of phosphates.
724900	731060	Planting of specific vegetation next to rivers and the shoreline can limit the inflow of
731060	733060	pollutants.
733060	736380	In this way, we can conserve our wetlands.
736380	738100	Thank you for joining us.
738100	745420	And it is time for you to do the TOSC video found at www.mindsearch.co.z for its slash
745420	746420	learn.
746420	746700	Goodbye.
