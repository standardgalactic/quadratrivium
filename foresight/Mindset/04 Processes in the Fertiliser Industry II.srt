1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,560
Good day, grade 12s!

2
00:00:08,560 --> 00:00:14,760
I hope you are ready for the next lesson about the processes used to make fertilizers.

3
00:00:14,760 --> 00:00:21,640
We already saw how distillation is used to extract nitrogen from the air to make ammonia.

4
00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:26,560
This ammonia is then used to make a number of other fertilizers.

5
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:32,720
Now we will learn about the Haber process in detail and go on to examine the Ostwald

6
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:35,400
ant contact processes too.

7
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:38,640
The Haber process is used to form ammonia.

8
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:45,960
Here, hydrogen is made to react with nitrogen to form ammonia under special conditions.

9
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:52,280
To ensure economically high yields of ammonia, which will be about 15%.

10
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:57,960
In order to get an economically high yield of ammonia, a reasonably high pressure of

11
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:02,800
200 atmospheres is used to favor the forward reaction.

12
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:07,960
The temperature should be approximately 450 degrees.

13
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:13,000
But remember, the forward reaction in ammonia production is exothermic.

14
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:18,080
Therefore, a high temperature actually favors the reverse reaction.

15
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:22,880
So the high temperature is a compromised temperature between getting an economically

16
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:29,600
viable maximum yield and an economically viable rate of production of ammonia.

17
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:34,680
Basically, the high temperature is to quicken the formation of ammonia.

18
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:40,800
Finally, an iron catalyst is used to speed up the overall reaction, keeping production

19
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:42,520
costs down.

20
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:48,120
Now that we know how to get a high yield of ammonia, let's see how this ammonia is

21
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:50,960
used to produce different fertilizers.

22
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:53,280
Let's continue with Adrian.

23
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:59,720
In the next step on the flowchart, ammonia is used to make nitric acid.

24
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:03,720
This is called the Ostwald process.

25
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:07,160
There are three chemical reactions in the Ostwald process.

26
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:10,020
Let's examine each of them in turn.

27
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:16,260
The first step of the Ostwald process is called the catalytic oxidation of ammonia.

28
00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:21,580
Ammonia reacts with oxygen to form nitrogen monoxide and water.

29
00:02:21,580 --> 00:02:31,580
The balanced chemical equation is 4NH3 plus 502 goes to form 4N0 plus 6H2O.

30
00:02:31,580 --> 00:02:37,500
The reaction is exothermic.

31
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:43,620
Ammonia and oxygen gas enter a reaction chamber filled with a mesh containing a platinum rhodium

32
00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:45,020
catalyst.

33
00:02:45,020 --> 00:02:49,140
At first, the catalyst is heated to start the process.

34
00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:54,260
Once the reaction begins, it produces enough heat to keep high operating temperatures of

35
00:02:54,260 --> 00:02:58,740
between 800 and 900 degrees Celsius.

36
00:02:58,740 --> 00:03:04,340
The pressure on the gases in the reaction chamber is kept at 3 to 4 atmospheres.

37
00:03:04,340 --> 00:03:12,100
Under these conditions, about 95% of the ammonia is oxidized to nitrogen monoxide.

38
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:16,700
The second step of the Ostwald process takes place in the same reaction chamber as the

39
00:03:16,700 --> 00:03:18,860
first step.

40
00:03:18,860 --> 00:03:25,060
Nitrogen monoxide from the first step is oxidized to form nitrogen dioxide.

41
00:03:25,060 --> 00:03:31,500
This second step of the Ostwald process is called the oxidation of nitrogen monoxide.

42
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:42,020
The balanced chemical equation for this reaction is 2NO plus O2 reacts to form 2NO2.

43
00:03:42,020 --> 00:03:47,500
This is also an exothermic reaction.

44
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:52,740
After the first two steps of the Ostwald process, not all the nitrogen monoxide has converted

45
00:03:52,740 --> 00:03:58,700
to nitrogen dioxide, so the mixture of gases is cooled in a condenser to less than 100

46
00:03:58,700 --> 00:04:00,820
degrees Celsius.

47
00:04:00,820 --> 00:04:06,140
Water vapor formed in the oxidation of ammonia condenses into liquid.

48
00:04:06,140 --> 00:04:12,060
This water absorbs some of the nitrogen dioxide to form nitric acid.

49
00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:17,980
This third step is called the absorption of nitrogen dioxide into water.

50
00:04:17,980 --> 00:04:30,700
The chemical equation is 3NO2 gas plus H2O liquid goes to form 2HNO3 aqueous plus NO gas.

51
00:04:30,700 --> 00:04:33,780
This is also an exothermic reaction.

52
00:04:33,780 --> 00:04:40,860
Unfortunately, a large amount of nitrogen monoxide and nitrogen dioxide remain unreacted

53
00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:47,380
in the condenser, so special distillation towers are used to convert the unreacted gases

54
00:04:47,380 --> 00:04:50,160
into nitric acid.

55
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:55,540
In the distillation tower, a fine spray of deionized water is released from the top of

56
00:04:55,540 --> 00:04:56,780
the tower.

57
00:04:56,780 --> 00:05:02,700
The unreacted nitrogen dioxide is drawn up from the bottom of the tower and dissolves

58
00:05:02,700 --> 00:05:04,660
in the water.

59
00:05:04,660 --> 00:05:09,460
There are trays arranged around the edges of the tower to collect the solution of nitric

60
00:05:09,460 --> 00:05:11,460
acid that is formed.

61
00:05:11,460 --> 00:05:17,460
But nitrogen monoxide is also formed in this reaction, and remember there is still unreacted

62
00:05:17,460 --> 00:05:22,580
nitrogen monoxide from the initial catalytic oxidation of ammonia.

63
00:05:22,580 --> 00:05:26,700
So how do industrial chemists solve this problem?

64
00:05:26,700 --> 00:05:32,100
Well, they draw oxygen into the bottom of the distillation tower and keep the temperature

65
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:38,260
of the gases at 50 degrees Celsius and the pressure at 9 to 10 atmospheres.

66
00:05:38,260 --> 00:05:45,180
Under these conditions, the excess nitrogen monoxide oxidizes to form nitrogen dioxide.

67
00:05:45,180 --> 00:05:51,980
The nitrogen dioxide dissolves in the water to form more nitric acid.

68
00:05:51,980 --> 00:05:57,500
Now let's go back to our flow chart to see what happens to the nitric acid.

69
00:05:57,500 --> 00:06:04,100
Nitric acid and ammonia can react together to make ammonium nitrate, which is used as

70
00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:07,620
a nitrogen-based fertilizer.

71
00:06:07,620 --> 00:06:13,820
In the first step of this process, an aqueous solution of ammonium nitrate is formed.

72
00:06:13,820 --> 00:06:19,980
The ammonia liquid neutralizes the acid to form a salt solution.

73
00:06:19,980 --> 00:06:26,760
In the second step, water is evaporated from the solution to form granules of solid ammonium

74
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:28,260
nitrate.

75
00:06:28,260 --> 00:06:35,920
Finally, once the granules are formed, substances such as magnesium oxide, magnesium nitrate

76
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:40,420
and calcium oxide are added to them as coatings.

77
00:06:40,420 --> 00:06:46,500
The role of these coatings is to prevent the ammonium nitrate from absorbing too much water.

78
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:54,500
In a very similar process, ammonia can react with sulfuric acid to form ammonium sulfate,

79
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:57,140
which is also a useful fertilizer.

80
00:06:57,140 --> 00:07:06,620
The chemical equation for the production of ammonium sulfate is 2NH3 plus H2SO4 goes

81
00:07:06,620 --> 00:07:15,140
to form brackets, NH4 close brackets twice SO4.

82
00:07:15,140 --> 00:07:18,400
There is one final process that we need to examine.

83
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:23,900
In this process, ammonia is used to produce urea.

84
00:07:23,900 --> 00:07:27,620
Urea is produced on a large scale across the world.

85
00:07:27,620 --> 00:07:34,560
It has a nitrogen content of 46,4 percent, the highest percentage of all common solid

86
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:37,940
nitrogen-based fertilizers.

87
00:07:37,940 --> 00:07:42,940
Urea is produced by reacting ammonia with carbon dioxide.

88
00:07:42,940 --> 00:07:48,540
There are two steps in the process as shown in these chemical equations.

89
00:07:48,540 --> 00:07:51,580
Let's review the big picture so far.

90
00:07:51,580 --> 00:07:58,660
We start by collecting nitrogen from the atmosphere and then fix it in the harbor process to form

91
00:07:58,660 --> 00:08:01,020
water soluble ammonia.

92
00:08:01,020 --> 00:08:09,700
Next, ammonia is used to make nitric acid and then nitric acid and ammonia are used

93
00:08:09,700 --> 00:08:15,940
in many different processes to make all the nitrogen-containing fertilizers we need.

94
00:08:15,940 --> 00:08:22,020
The Ostward process leads to the formation of nitric acid, which reacts with ammonia

95
00:08:22,020 --> 00:08:26,340
to form a common fertilizer called ammonium nitrate.

96
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:32,620
The contact process focuses on the formation of sulfuric acid, which reacts with ammonia

97
00:08:32,620 --> 00:08:36,060
to form ammonium sulfate fertilizer.

98
00:08:36,060 --> 00:08:39,620
The other fertilizer that is formed is urea.

99
00:08:39,620 --> 00:08:44,020
This is formed when ammonia reacts with carbon dioxide.

100
00:08:44,020 --> 00:08:51,180
The flow diagram shows the formation of the common nitrogen-based fertilizer we just discussed.

101
00:08:51,180 --> 00:08:57,620
Besides nitrogen-based fertilizers, we also get the phosphate-based fertilizers and potassium-based

102
00:08:57,620 --> 00:08:59,620
ones.

103
00:08:59,620 --> 00:09:05,220
Phosphate-based fertilizers are formed when phosphate rock reacts with sulfuric acid to

104
00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:08,380
form phosphoric acid.

105
00:09:08,380 --> 00:09:13,980
Phosphoric acid reacts with ammonia to form superphosphate fertilizer.

106
00:09:13,980 --> 00:09:20,620
These superphosphates are soluble in water and can be absorbed easily by plants.

107
00:09:20,620 --> 00:09:27,380
The nitrogen-based fertilizers are also soluble in water, making them absorbable too.

108
00:09:27,380 --> 00:09:33,660
Other known fertilizers are those that contain potassium salts, also known as potash, when

109
00:09:33,660 --> 00:09:36,500
used as fertilizer.

110
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:46,940
Common-based fertilizers include potassium nitrate, KN03, and potassium sulfate K2SO4.

111
00:09:46,940 --> 00:09:51,980
Extensive use of all these forms of fertilizer could have a negative impact on humans and

112
00:09:51,980 --> 00:09:54,300
their environment.

113
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:59,940
Fertilizers often lead to problems such as nitrogen saturation, groundwater pollution,

114
00:09:59,940 --> 00:10:03,700
deutrophication, and soil acidification.

115
00:10:03,700 --> 00:10:10,220
High concentrations of acid in soil could end up in our water stream and groundwater.

116
00:10:10,220 --> 00:10:15,700
This means there could be a high concentration of nitrates in the water that humans drink.

117
00:10:15,700 --> 00:10:21,580
In humans, a high concentration of nitrate in the body could lead to a shortage of oxygen

118
00:10:21,580 --> 00:10:24,780
in the organs and tissues.

119
00:10:24,780 --> 00:10:30,700
Fertilizers in the body get converted to nitrates by oxidizing iron atoms.

120
00:10:30,700 --> 00:10:36,180
With fewer iron atoms, less oxygen can be carried in the blood.

121
00:10:36,180 --> 00:10:42,060
Shortage of oxygen could be fatal to humans, especially babies and older people.

122
00:10:42,060 --> 00:10:47,860
The same thing can happen to plants, fish, and other animals.

123
00:10:47,860 --> 00:10:51,180
Deutrophication is an excess of nutrients in water.

124
00:10:51,180 --> 00:10:57,940
This is due to over-fertilization, sewage waste, an increase in nutrients in an ecosystem

125
00:10:57,940 --> 00:11:04,660
like nitrogen and phosphate, and burning of fossil fuels such as coal at sassel.

126
00:11:04,660 --> 00:11:09,700
The impact of deutrophication can be seen on land and in water.

127
00:11:09,700 --> 00:11:14,340
And water rapid and excessive growth of algae occurs.

128
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:19,820
When this algae dies later, it becomes food for bacteria that deplete the oxygen in the

129
00:11:19,820 --> 00:11:22,380
water during respiration.

130
00:11:22,380 --> 00:11:26,500
Fish and other organisms die from low oxygen.

131
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:30,860
On land, weeds grow at the cost of indigenous plants.

132
00:11:30,860 --> 00:11:37,460
This leads to a change in the diversity of species, thus ecosystems change.

133
00:11:37,460 --> 00:11:43,780
Soil erosion is often a result due to the absence of natural vegetation.

134
00:11:43,780 --> 00:11:50,300
Manure from feedlots and milk stalls can be removed before it runs into surface water.

135
00:11:50,300 --> 00:11:53,860
Manure can be used as organic fertilizer.

136
00:11:53,860 --> 00:11:57,220
In this way, nutrients will be recycled.

137
00:11:57,220 --> 00:12:03,060
The diet of stock animals can be adapted to their needs, so decreasing their excretion

138
00:12:03,060 --> 00:12:04,900
of phosphates.

139
00:12:04,900 --> 00:12:11,060
Planting of specific vegetation next to rivers and the shoreline can limit the inflow of

140
00:12:11,060 --> 00:12:13,060
pollutants.

141
00:12:13,060 --> 00:12:16,380
In this way, we can conserve our wetlands.

142
00:12:16,380 --> 00:12:18,100
Thank you for joining us.

143
00:12:18,100 --> 00:12:25,420
And it is time for you to do the TOSC video found at www.mindsearch.co.z for its slash

144
00:12:25,420 --> 00:12:26,420
learn.

145
00:12:26,420 --> 00:12:26,700
Goodbye.
