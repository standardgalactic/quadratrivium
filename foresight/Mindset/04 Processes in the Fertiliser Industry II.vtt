00:00.000 --> 00:08.560
Good day, grade 12s!

00:08.560 --> 00:14.760
I hope you are ready for the next lesson about the processes used to make fertilizers.

00:14.760 --> 00:21.640
We already saw how distillation is used to extract nitrogen from the air to make ammonia.

00:21.640 --> 00:26.560
This ammonia is then used to make a number of other fertilizers.

00:26.560 --> 00:32.720
Now we will learn about the Haber process in detail and go on to examine the Ostwald

00:32.720 --> 00:35.400
ant contact processes too.

00:35.400 --> 00:38.640
The Haber process is used to form ammonia.

00:38.640 --> 00:45.960
Here, hydrogen is made to react with nitrogen to form ammonia under special conditions.

00:45.960 --> 00:52.280
To ensure economically high yields of ammonia, which will be about 15%.

00:52.280 --> 00:57.960
In order to get an economically high yield of ammonia, a reasonably high pressure of

00:57.960 --> 01:02.800
200 atmospheres is used to favor the forward reaction.

01:02.800 --> 01:07.960
The temperature should be approximately 450 degrees.

01:07.960 --> 01:13.000
But remember, the forward reaction in ammonia production is exothermic.

01:13.000 --> 01:18.080
Therefore, a high temperature actually favors the reverse reaction.

01:18.080 --> 01:22.880
So the high temperature is a compromised temperature between getting an economically

01:22.880 --> 01:29.600
viable maximum yield and an economically viable rate of production of ammonia.

01:29.600 --> 01:34.680
Basically, the high temperature is to quicken the formation of ammonia.

01:34.680 --> 01:40.800
Finally, an iron catalyst is used to speed up the overall reaction, keeping production

01:40.800 --> 01:42.520
costs down.

01:42.520 --> 01:48.120
Now that we know how to get a high yield of ammonia, let's see how this ammonia is

01:48.120 --> 01:50.960
used to produce different fertilizers.

01:50.960 --> 01:53.280
Let's continue with Adrian.

01:53.280 --> 01:59.720
In the next step on the flowchart, ammonia is used to make nitric acid.

01:59.720 --> 02:03.720
This is called the Ostwald process.

02:03.720 --> 02:07.160
There are three chemical reactions in the Ostwald process.

02:07.160 --> 02:10.020
Let's examine each of them in turn.

02:10.020 --> 02:16.260
The first step of the Ostwald process is called the catalytic oxidation of ammonia.

02:16.260 --> 02:21.580
Ammonia reacts with oxygen to form nitrogen monoxide and water.

02:21.580 --> 02:31.580
The balanced chemical equation is 4NH3 plus 502 goes to form 4N0 plus 6H2O.

02:31.580 --> 02:37.500
The reaction is exothermic.

02:37.500 --> 02:43.620
Ammonia and oxygen gas enter a reaction chamber filled with a mesh containing a platinum rhodium

02:43.620 --> 02:45.020
catalyst.

02:45.020 --> 02:49.140
At first, the catalyst is heated to start the process.

02:49.140 --> 02:54.260
Once the reaction begins, it produces enough heat to keep high operating temperatures of

02:54.260 --> 02:58.740
between 800 and 900 degrees Celsius.

02:58.740 --> 03:04.340
The pressure on the gases in the reaction chamber is kept at 3 to 4 atmospheres.

03:04.340 --> 03:12.100
Under these conditions, about 95% of the ammonia is oxidized to nitrogen monoxide.

03:12.100 --> 03:16.700
The second step of the Ostwald process takes place in the same reaction chamber as the

03:16.700 --> 03:18.860
first step.

03:18.860 --> 03:25.060
Nitrogen monoxide from the first step is oxidized to form nitrogen dioxide.

03:25.060 --> 03:31.500
This second step of the Ostwald process is called the oxidation of nitrogen monoxide.

03:31.500 --> 03:42.020
The balanced chemical equation for this reaction is 2NO plus O2 reacts to form 2NO2.

03:42.020 --> 03:47.500
This is also an exothermic reaction.

03:47.500 --> 03:52.740
After the first two steps of the Ostwald process, not all the nitrogen monoxide has converted

03:52.740 --> 03:58.700
to nitrogen dioxide, so the mixture of gases is cooled in a condenser to less than 100

03:58.700 --> 04:00.820
degrees Celsius.

04:00.820 --> 04:06.140
Water vapor formed in the oxidation of ammonia condenses into liquid.

04:06.140 --> 04:12.060
This water absorbs some of the nitrogen dioxide to form nitric acid.

04:12.060 --> 04:17.980
This third step is called the absorption of nitrogen dioxide into water.

04:17.980 --> 04:30.700
The chemical equation is 3NO2 gas plus H2O liquid goes to form 2HNO3 aqueous plus NO gas.

04:30.700 --> 04:33.780
This is also an exothermic reaction.

04:33.780 --> 04:40.860
Unfortunately, a large amount of nitrogen monoxide and nitrogen dioxide remain unreacted

04:40.860 --> 04:47.380
in the condenser, so special distillation towers are used to convert the unreacted gases

04:47.380 --> 04:50.160
into nitric acid.

04:50.160 --> 04:55.540
In the distillation tower, a fine spray of deionized water is released from the top of

04:55.540 --> 04:56.780
the tower.

04:56.780 --> 05:02.700
The unreacted nitrogen dioxide is drawn up from the bottom of the tower and dissolves

05:02.700 --> 05:04.660
in the water.

05:04.660 --> 05:09.460
There are trays arranged around the edges of the tower to collect the solution of nitric

05:09.460 --> 05:11.460
acid that is formed.

05:11.460 --> 05:17.460
But nitrogen monoxide is also formed in this reaction, and remember there is still unreacted

05:17.460 --> 05:22.580
nitrogen monoxide from the initial catalytic oxidation of ammonia.

05:22.580 --> 05:26.700
So how do industrial chemists solve this problem?

05:26.700 --> 05:32.100
Well, they draw oxygen into the bottom of the distillation tower and keep the temperature

05:32.100 --> 05:38.260
of the gases at 50 degrees Celsius and the pressure at 9 to 10 atmospheres.

05:38.260 --> 05:45.180
Under these conditions, the excess nitrogen monoxide oxidizes to form nitrogen dioxide.

05:45.180 --> 05:51.980
The nitrogen dioxide dissolves in the water to form more nitric acid.

05:51.980 --> 05:57.500
Now let's go back to our flow chart to see what happens to the nitric acid.

05:57.500 --> 06:04.100
Nitric acid and ammonia can react together to make ammonium nitrate, which is used as

06:04.100 --> 06:07.620
a nitrogen-based fertilizer.

06:07.620 --> 06:13.820
In the first step of this process, an aqueous solution of ammonium nitrate is formed.

06:13.820 --> 06:19.980
The ammonia liquid neutralizes the acid to form a salt solution.

06:19.980 --> 06:26.760
In the second step, water is evaporated from the solution to form granules of solid ammonium

06:26.760 --> 06:28.260
nitrate.

06:28.260 --> 06:35.920
Finally, once the granules are formed, substances such as magnesium oxide, magnesium nitrate

06:35.920 --> 06:40.420
and calcium oxide are added to them as coatings.

06:40.420 --> 06:46.500
The role of these coatings is to prevent the ammonium nitrate from absorbing too much water.

06:46.500 --> 06:54.500
In a very similar process, ammonia can react with sulfuric acid to form ammonium sulfate,

06:54.500 --> 06:57.140
which is also a useful fertilizer.

06:57.140 --> 07:06.620
The chemical equation for the production of ammonium sulfate is 2NH3 plus H2SO4 goes

07:06.620 --> 07:15.140
to form brackets, NH4 close brackets twice SO4.

07:15.140 --> 07:18.400
There is one final process that we need to examine.

07:18.400 --> 07:23.900
In this process, ammonia is used to produce urea.

07:23.900 --> 07:27.620
Urea is produced on a large scale across the world.

07:27.620 --> 07:34.560
It has a nitrogen content of 46,4 percent, the highest percentage of all common solid

07:34.560 --> 07:37.940
nitrogen-based fertilizers.

07:37.940 --> 07:42.940
Urea is produced by reacting ammonia with carbon dioxide.

07:42.940 --> 07:48.540
There are two steps in the process as shown in these chemical equations.

07:48.540 --> 07:51.580
Let's review the big picture so far.

07:51.580 --> 07:58.660
We start by collecting nitrogen from the atmosphere and then fix it in the harbor process to form

07:58.660 --> 08:01.020
water soluble ammonia.

08:01.020 --> 08:09.700
Next, ammonia is used to make nitric acid and then nitric acid and ammonia are used

08:09.700 --> 08:15.940
in many different processes to make all the nitrogen-containing fertilizers we need.

08:15.940 --> 08:22.020
The Ostward process leads to the formation of nitric acid, which reacts with ammonia

08:22.020 --> 08:26.340
to form a common fertilizer called ammonium nitrate.

08:26.340 --> 08:32.620
The contact process focuses on the formation of sulfuric acid, which reacts with ammonia

08:32.620 --> 08:36.060
to form ammonium sulfate fertilizer.

08:36.060 --> 08:39.620
The other fertilizer that is formed is urea.

08:39.620 --> 08:44.020
This is formed when ammonia reacts with carbon dioxide.

08:44.020 --> 08:51.180
The flow diagram shows the formation of the common nitrogen-based fertilizer we just discussed.

08:51.180 --> 08:57.620
Besides nitrogen-based fertilizers, we also get the phosphate-based fertilizers and potassium-based

08:57.620 --> 08:59.620
ones.

08:59.620 --> 09:05.220
Phosphate-based fertilizers are formed when phosphate rock reacts with sulfuric acid to

09:05.220 --> 09:08.380
form phosphoric acid.

09:08.380 --> 09:13.980
Phosphoric acid reacts with ammonia to form superphosphate fertilizer.

09:13.980 --> 09:20.620
These superphosphates are soluble in water and can be absorbed easily by plants.

09:20.620 --> 09:27.380
The nitrogen-based fertilizers are also soluble in water, making them absorbable too.

09:27.380 --> 09:33.660
Other known fertilizers are those that contain potassium salts, also known as potash, when

09:33.660 --> 09:36.500
used as fertilizer.

09:36.500 --> 09:46.940
Common-based fertilizers include potassium nitrate, KN03, and potassium sulfate K2SO4.

09:46.940 --> 09:51.980
Extensive use of all these forms of fertilizer could have a negative impact on humans and

09:51.980 --> 09:54.300
their environment.

09:54.300 --> 09:59.940
Fertilizers often lead to problems such as nitrogen saturation, groundwater pollution,

09:59.940 --> 10:03.700
deutrophication, and soil acidification.

10:03.700 --> 10:10.220
High concentrations of acid in soil could end up in our water stream and groundwater.

10:10.220 --> 10:15.700
This means there could be a high concentration of nitrates in the water that humans drink.

10:15.700 --> 10:21.580
In humans, a high concentration of nitrate in the body could lead to a shortage of oxygen

10:21.580 --> 10:24.780
in the organs and tissues.

10:24.780 --> 10:30.700
Fertilizers in the body get converted to nitrates by oxidizing iron atoms.

10:30.700 --> 10:36.180
With fewer iron atoms, less oxygen can be carried in the blood.

10:36.180 --> 10:42.060
Shortage of oxygen could be fatal to humans, especially babies and older people.

10:42.060 --> 10:47.860
The same thing can happen to plants, fish, and other animals.

10:47.860 --> 10:51.180
Deutrophication is an excess of nutrients in water.

10:51.180 --> 10:57.940
This is due to over-fertilization, sewage waste, an increase in nutrients in an ecosystem

10:57.940 --> 11:04.660
like nitrogen and phosphate, and burning of fossil fuels such as coal at sassel.

11:04.660 --> 11:09.700
The impact of deutrophication can be seen on land and in water.

11:09.700 --> 11:14.340
And water rapid and excessive growth of algae occurs.

11:14.340 --> 11:19.820
When this algae dies later, it becomes food for bacteria that deplete the oxygen in the

11:19.820 --> 11:22.380
water during respiration.

11:22.380 --> 11:26.500
Fish and other organisms die from low oxygen.

11:26.500 --> 11:30.860
On land, weeds grow at the cost of indigenous plants.

11:30.860 --> 11:37.460
This leads to a change in the diversity of species, thus ecosystems change.

11:37.460 --> 11:43.780
Soil erosion is often a result due to the absence of natural vegetation.

11:43.780 --> 11:50.300
Manure from feedlots and milk stalls can be removed before it runs into surface water.

11:50.300 --> 11:53.860
Manure can be used as organic fertilizer.

11:53.860 --> 11:57.220
In this way, nutrients will be recycled.

11:57.220 --> 12:03.060
The diet of stock animals can be adapted to their needs, so decreasing their excretion

12:03.060 --> 12:04.900
of phosphates.

12:04.900 --> 12:11.060
Planting of specific vegetation next to rivers and the shoreline can limit the inflow of

12:11.060 --> 12:13.060
pollutants.

12:13.060 --> 12:16.380
In this way, we can conserve our wetlands.

12:16.380 --> 12:18.100
Thank you for joining us.

12:18.100 --> 12:25.420
And it is time for you to do the TOSC video found at www.mindsearch.co.z for its slash

12:25.420 --> 12:26.420
learn.

12:26.420 --> 12:26.700
Goodbye.
