Checking Mindset/04 Processes in the Fertiliser Industry II.txt
1. Urea is a common solid nitrogen-based fertilizer with a high nitrogen content of 46.4%.
2. It is produced by reacting ammonia with carbon dioxide in a two-step process.
3. Ammonia, which is derived from fixing atmospheric nitrogen through the Haber-Bosch process, is also used to produce other nitrogen-based fertilizers like urea and nitric acid.
4. Nitric acid can further react with ammonia to form ammonium nitrate, a widely used nitrogen-based fertilizer.
5. The contact process produces sulfuric acid, which reacts with ammonia to form ammonium sulfate, another nitrogen-based fertilizer.
6. Phosphate-based fertilizers are made from reacting phosphate rock with sulfuric acid to produce phosphoric acid, which then reacts with ammonia to form superphosphate.
7. Potassium-based fertilizers include potassium nitrate and potassium sulfate, which are also used as fertilizers.
8. The extensive use of these fertilizers can lead to environmental issues such as soil saturation, groundwater pollution, eutrophication, and soil acidification.
9. Eutrophication results from an excess of nutrients in ecosystems, often due to over-fertilization, sewage waste, fossil fuel combustion, and runoff from agricultural lands.
10. Consequences of eutrophication include algal blooms that deplete oxygen in water bodies, leading to fish kills and changes in biodiversity.
11. Soil erosion can also occur due to the absence of natural vegetation.
12. Solutions to mitigate these issues include managing manure application, adapting stock animal diets to reduce phosphate excretion, and planting vegetation to protect water bodies and wetlands.
13. It is important for individuals to be aware of the environmental impact of fertilizer use and to take steps to minimize negative consequences through sustainable practices.
