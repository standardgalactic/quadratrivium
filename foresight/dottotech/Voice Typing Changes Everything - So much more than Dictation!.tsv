0	3600	Steve Dotto here. How the heck are you doing this fine day? And today on The Big Show,
3600	7840	I want to talk to you about dictation, more than just straight up dictation. We've had
7840	12240	dictation for a long time. On our smartphones, on our computer, both Apple and Microsoft
12240	17040	gives us system level dictation, which works phenomenally well. If you just want to type
17040	22480	into a document, you can do it with your voice using the dictation features that are built
22480	28640	into your operating system. But Google has taken that and said, hold my beer, I've got
28640	33760	something better called voice typing. It is a step beyond dictation and it might just change
33760	39680	your life. That's today on Dotto Tech. Okay, let's set things up. For the longest time,
39680	44400	we've been able to use dictation, which is built into the operating system of our computers and
44400	49120	our smartphones. In the Apple world, if you go under the keyboard in the system extensions,
49120	54000	you can go into dictation and you can turn on dictation, allowing you to be able to speak
54000	58560	into the microphone and have that speech translated into text. So for example,
58560	63200	if I'm in Evernote, and for me, I got it enabled with just a keyboard shortcut, I hit the keyboard
63200	70240	shortcut, and I can start dictating comma, it will accept punctuation, it will allow me
70240	76400	to write with my voice, which is a very awesome, except for one fact, if I need to edit anything.
77920	82560	So as soon as I click my mouse inside of dictation and try and make any changes,
83280	87360	I lose control. And it, well, I don't lose control, but the dictation starts, stops,
87360	93760	and I have to start over again. And this is good. But there is better, allow me to show you better.
93760	100240	If we go into Google Docs, under the tools menu is voice typing. It's just kind of sitting there
100240	107120	like nothing special, but it is indeed something special. Let me show you how voice typing works.
107120	112400	Voice typing allows us to do this, we turn it on, and a little dialogue box appears that allows
112560	116880	a switch really, that allows us to turn it on. It'll use our computer's microphone.
116880	121280	Let me put an insertion point in the document so that we can start before I turn on the
121840	125120	voice typing, and I'm going to put a couple returns so that we can see
125760	130400	exactly what it is I'm doing. Now, into this blank space here, I'm going to start typing with my
130400	135200	voice. And we've just seen me do that using the system level tool, so this isn't too amazing.
135200	141200	But it's what I do as I type that I want you to pay attention to. I am going to edit the document
141200	146160	on the fly as you would if you were normally typing, not just dictating and then having to stop and
146160	154000	start over again, but continuing to type as with my voice by making changes, highlighting text,
154000	161840	adding carriage returns, etc. So watch. I've now turned on the voice dictation, and as you expect,
161840	168720	it is accurately recording what I'm saying and converting that into text. Now, the big difference
168720	174480	between what I'm doing right now, comma, and what was being done with straight dictation,
174480	182160	is if I click my mouse now, comma, it will not stop the system from listening, but instead,
182160	188240	it will allow me to interactively work with my keyboard and mouse and my voice all at the
188560	193040	same time. Period. New paragraph. This is straight up amazing.
196000	206400	Bold. I can insert and start typing again. I can add to the text. I can do basic formatting.
207280	208480	I can change words.
208560	219120	Mouse. So this allows me to interactively work with the document. Period.
221200	230240	New line. For me, this is a game changer. Period. New paragraph. Let me show you
230240	234560	some of the commands that are available to you. Now, before I talk to you about the different
234640	240800	commands that are built in, I should tell you that this works on so many languages and so many
240800	247680	accents. Here is a list of the different languages that is supported under voice typing
247680	252880	and the dialects or the accents that are incorporated in those different languages.
252880	259280	So pretty much as far as I can tell, a vast majority of the world's languages is supported
259280	265600	by this technology, which again, I'm just gobstopped that Google isn't telling this to the
265600	271600	entire world and telling us what a great tool this is because this is pretty darned amazing.
271600	276560	Don't you agree? Now, you choose your language here under this dialogue box here inside of
277520	281920	when you open the tool, you can access the language of choice. You have to choose the
281920	286240	language that you're going to be working with. And I can't really tell a difference between
286240	292240	United States English and UK English. Maybe it's because I have a very neutral accent.
292960	297680	I thought it might be it does different spelling, but the spelling is set basically in your keyboard
297680	303600	settings, not here in this in this dialogue box. So for English, either one is probably going to
303600	308880	work quite well. Now, what commands do we have available? I've shown you basic punctuation,
308880	314160	so you know that we can do commas, paragraphs, you can end a sentence with proper punctuation,
314160	320640	such as a question mark, period, or an exclamation mark, period, you will notice it automatically
320640	329280	capitalizes the beginning of new sentences, period, new line. And we can start new sentences on new
329280	338240	lines or in an entirely different paragraph, period, new paragraph. And you see the formatting
338240	344800	carries through. Now you can also select text, and you can apply basic formatting to that text.
344800	356560	So let's start it up again and watch. Select formatting bold undo new line.
357360	367840	You can adjust font size or color. Select line. Text color red.
370560	376400	Make it bigger. I think you get the idea that we can do so much basic formatting,
376400	382080	but the concept of this interactive nature of staying on your keyboard and mouse being able to
382080	389520	select text, make changes verbally, and just kind of work interactively with our other input
389520	395440	devices, to me, as I say, I believe it's a real game changer. I'm going to share a document with
395440	401200	you, which will teach you all of the different commands, because you have to be specific in
401200	406640	the wording of the commands as you use the formatting commands to increase font sizes,
406640	412000	to do paragraph formatting, alignment, adjust columns to create lists. All of that is built
412000	418480	into the voice typing, but you do have to learn the nomenclature, and it's very simple. There will
418480	424560	be a link in the description below. So I'm wondering, what do you think? Am I on point with
424560	430320	thinking this is a real game changer? I have started to write using this technique, and I have to say
430320	435200	that I feel I am far more productive, far more creative, and a little less lazy. You know,
435200	439440	sometimes I would think I would write a sentence and I wouldn't be entirely happy with it,
439440	443280	and it seems like a lot of work to go back and edit it on the keyboard. Whereas by voice,
444320	451120	maybe it's just me, but I am finding it a pleasure to be writing using voice typing.
451120	455680	For the longest time, I thought voice typing and dictation were the same thing, but I think that
455680	461280	we've seen here right now that they are very different, and this is available to us free
461280	467360	as a part of Google Docs. So try it out. Let me know in the comments what you think. Will
467360	473840	this have the potential to change the way that you write? Is it a huge benefit to you, or maybe it
473840	477280	gets in the way? Maybe you prefer being on the keyboard. I would love to hear your thoughts
477280	482640	in comments below. Now, if you found this video to be useful and helpful and inspire you in any way,
482640	486880	well then a like and a share would be greatly appreciated, as of course, would a subscribe.
487600	491360	Now before we leave, I have one last thing that I want to let you know about, and that is every
491360	496400	week here at Dotto Tech, we host a weekly tutorial webinar called Webinar Wednesday. It's free,
496400	501680	it's on some aspect of productivity or content creation, and I am here by officially inviting
501680	505440	you to join us for an upcoming Webinar Wednesday. I hope to see you there.
505440	514000	Till next time, I'm Steve Dotto. Have fun storming the castle!
