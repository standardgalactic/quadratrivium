00:00.000 --> 00:03.600
Steve Dotto here. How the heck are you doing this fine day? And today on The Big Show,

00:03.600 --> 00:07.840
I want to talk to you about dictation, more than just straight up dictation. We've had

00:07.840 --> 00:12.240
dictation for a long time. On our smartphones, on our computer, both Apple and Microsoft

00:12.240 --> 00:17.040
gives us system level dictation, which works phenomenally well. If you just want to type

00:17.040 --> 00:22.480
into a document, you can do it with your voice using the dictation features that are built

00:22.480 --> 00:28.640
into your operating system. But Google has taken that and said, hold my beer, I've got

00:28.640 --> 00:33.760
something better called voice typing. It is a step beyond dictation and it might just change

00:33.760 --> 00:39.680
your life. That's today on Dotto Tech. Okay, let's set things up. For the longest time,

00:39.680 --> 00:44.400
we've been able to use dictation, which is built into the operating system of our computers and

00:44.400 --> 00:49.120
our smartphones. In the Apple world, if you go under the keyboard in the system extensions,

00:49.120 --> 00:54.000
you can go into dictation and you can turn on dictation, allowing you to be able to speak

00:54.000 --> 00:58.560
into the microphone and have that speech translated into text. So for example,

00:58.560 --> 01:03.200
if I'm in Evernote, and for me, I got it enabled with just a keyboard shortcut, I hit the keyboard

01:03.200 --> 01:10.240
shortcut, and I can start dictating comma, it will accept punctuation, it will allow me

01:10.240 --> 01:16.400
to write with my voice, which is a very awesome, except for one fact, if I need to edit anything.

01:17.920 --> 01:22.560
So as soon as I click my mouse inside of dictation and try and make any changes,

01:23.280 --> 01:27.360
I lose control. And it, well, I don't lose control, but the dictation starts, stops,

01:27.360 --> 01:33.760
and I have to start over again. And this is good. But there is better, allow me to show you better.

01:33.760 --> 01:40.240
If we go into Google Docs, under the tools menu is voice typing. It's just kind of sitting there

01:40.240 --> 01:47.120
like nothing special, but it is indeed something special. Let me show you how voice typing works.

01:47.120 --> 01:52.400
Voice typing allows us to do this, we turn it on, and a little dialogue box appears that allows

01:52.560 --> 01:56.880
a switch really, that allows us to turn it on. It'll use our computer's microphone.

01:56.880 --> 02:01.280
Let me put an insertion point in the document so that we can start before I turn on the

02:01.840 --> 02:05.120
voice typing, and I'm going to put a couple returns so that we can see

02:05.760 --> 02:10.400
exactly what it is I'm doing. Now, into this blank space here, I'm going to start typing with my

02:10.400 --> 02:15.200
voice. And we've just seen me do that using the system level tool, so this isn't too amazing.

02:15.200 --> 02:21.200
But it's what I do as I type that I want you to pay attention to. I am going to edit the document

02:21.200 --> 02:26.160
on the fly as you would if you were normally typing, not just dictating and then having to stop and

02:26.160 --> 02:34.000
start over again, but continuing to type as with my voice by making changes, highlighting text,

02:34.000 --> 02:41.840
adding carriage returns, etc. So watch. I've now turned on the voice dictation, and as you expect,

02:41.840 --> 02:48.720
it is accurately recording what I'm saying and converting that into text. Now, the big difference

02:48.720 --> 02:54.480
between what I'm doing right now, comma, and what was being done with straight dictation,

02:54.480 --> 03:02.160
is if I click my mouse now, comma, it will not stop the system from listening, but instead,

03:02.160 --> 03:08.240
it will allow me to interactively work with my keyboard and mouse and my voice all at the

03:08.560 --> 03:13.040
same time. Period. New paragraph. This is straight up amazing.

03:16.000 --> 03:26.400
Bold. I can insert and start typing again. I can add to the text. I can do basic formatting.

03:27.280 --> 03:28.480
I can change words.

03:28.560 --> 03:39.120
Mouse. So this allows me to interactively work with the document. Period.

03:41.200 --> 03:50.240
New line. For me, this is a game changer. Period. New paragraph. Let me show you

03:50.240 --> 03:54.560
some of the commands that are available to you. Now, before I talk to you about the different

03:54.640 --> 04:00.800
commands that are built in, I should tell you that this works on so many languages and so many

04:00.800 --> 04:07.680
accents. Here is a list of the different languages that is supported under voice typing

04:07.680 --> 04:12.880
and the dialects or the accents that are incorporated in those different languages.

04:12.880 --> 04:19.280
So pretty much as far as I can tell, a vast majority of the world's languages is supported

04:19.280 --> 04:25.600
by this technology, which again, I'm just gobstopped that Google isn't telling this to the

04:25.600 --> 04:31.600
entire world and telling us what a great tool this is because this is pretty darned amazing.

04:31.600 --> 04:36.560
Don't you agree? Now, you choose your language here under this dialogue box here inside of

04:37.520 --> 04:41.920
when you open the tool, you can access the language of choice. You have to choose the

04:41.920 --> 04:46.240
language that you're going to be working with. And I can't really tell a difference between

04:46.240 --> 04:52.240
United States English and UK English. Maybe it's because I have a very neutral accent.

04:52.960 --> 04:57.680
I thought it might be it does different spelling, but the spelling is set basically in your keyboard

04:57.680 --> 05:03.600
settings, not here in this in this dialogue box. So for English, either one is probably going to

05:03.600 --> 05:08.880
work quite well. Now, what commands do we have available? I've shown you basic punctuation,

05:08.880 --> 05:14.160
so you know that we can do commas, paragraphs, you can end a sentence with proper punctuation,

05:14.160 --> 05:20.640
such as a question mark, period, or an exclamation mark, period, you will notice it automatically

05:20.640 --> 05:29.280
capitalizes the beginning of new sentences, period, new line. And we can start new sentences on new

05:29.280 --> 05:38.240
lines or in an entirely different paragraph, period, new paragraph. And you see the formatting

05:38.240 --> 05:44.800
carries through. Now you can also select text, and you can apply basic formatting to that text.

05:44.800 --> 05:56.560
So let's start it up again and watch. Select formatting bold undo new line.

05:57.360 --> 06:07.840
You can adjust font size or color. Select line. Text color red.

06:10.560 --> 06:16.400
Make it bigger. I think you get the idea that we can do so much basic formatting,

06:16.400 --> 06:22.080
but the concept of this interactive nature of staying on your keyboard and mouse being able to

06:22.080 --> 06:29.520
select text, make changes verbally, and just kind of work interactively with our other input

06:29.520 --> 06:35.440
devices, to me, as I say, I believe it's a real game changer. I'm going to share a document with

06:35.440 --> 06:41.200
you, which will teach you all of the different commands, because you have to be specific in

06:41.200 --> 06:46.640
the wording of the commands as you use the formatting commands to increase font sizes,

06:46.640 --> 06:52.000
to do paragraph formatting, alignment, adjust columns to create lists. All of that is built

06:52.000 --> 06:58.480
into the voice typing, but you do have to learn the nomenclature, and it's very simple. There will

06:58.480 --> 07:04.560
be a link in the description below. So I'm wondering, what do you think? Am I on point with

07:04.560 --> 07:10.320
thinking this is a real game changer? I have started to write using this technique, and I have to say

07:10.320 --> 07:15.200
that I feel I am far more productive, far more creative, and a little less lazy. You know,

07:15.200 --> 07:19.440
sometimes I would think I would write a sentence and I wouldn't be entirely happy with it,

07:19.440 --> 07:23.280
and it seems like a lot of work to go back and edit it on the keyboard. Whereas by voice,

07:24.320 --> 07:31.120
maybe it's just me, but I am finding it a pleasure to be writing using voice typing.

07:31.120 --> 07:35.680
For the longest time, I thought voice typing and dictation were the same thing, but I think that

07:35.680 --> 07:41.280
we've seen here right now that they are very different, and this is available to us free

07:41.280 --> 07:47.360
as a part of Google Docs. So try it out. Let me know in the comments what you think. Will

07:47.360 --> 07:53.840
this have the potential to change the way that you write? Is it a huge benefit to you, or maybe it

07:53.840 --> 07:57.280
gets in the way? Maybe you prefer being on the keyboard. I would love to hear your thoughts

07:57.280 --> 08:02.640
in comments below. Now, if you found this video to be useful and helpful and inspire you in any way,

08:02.640 --> 08:06.880
well then a like and a share would be greatly appreciated, as of course, would a subscribe.

08:07.600 --> 08:11.360
Now before we leave, I have one last thing that I want to let you know about, and that is every

08:11.360 --> 08:16.400
week here at Dotto Tech, we host a weekly tutorial webinar called Webinar Wednesday. It's free,

08:16.400 --> 08:21.680
it's on some aspect of productivity or content creation, and I am here by officially inviting

08:21.680 --> 08:25.440
you to join us for an upcoming Webinar Wednesday. I hope to see you there.

08:25.440 --> 08:34.000
Till next time, I'm Steve Dotto. Have fun storming the castle!
