00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,600
Steve Dotto here. How the heck are you doing this fine day? And today on The Big Show,

2
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:07,840
I want to talk to you about dictation, more than just straight up dictation. We've had

3
00:00:07,840 --> 00:00:12,240
dictation for a long time. On our smartphones, on our computer, both Apple and Microsoft

4
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:17,040
gives us system level dictation, which works phenomenally well. If you just want to type

5
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:22,480
into a document, you can do it with your voice using the dictation features that are built

6
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:28,640
into your operating system. But Google has taken that and said, hold my beer, I've got

7
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:33,760
something better called voice typing. It is a step beyond dictation and it might just change

8
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:39,680
your life. That's today on Dotto Tech. Okay, let's set things up. For the longest time,

9
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:44,400
we've been able to use dictation, which is built into the operating system of our computers and

10
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:49,120
our smartphones. In the Apple world, if you go under the keyboard in the system extensions,

11
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:54,000
you can go into dictation and you can turn on dictation, allowing you to be able to speak

12
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,560
into the microphone and have that speech translated into text. So for example,

13
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:03,200
if I'm in Evernote, and for me, I got it enabled with just a keyboard shortcut, I hit the keyboard

14
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:10,240
shortcut, and I can start dictating comma, it will accept punctuation, it will allow me

15
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:16,400
to write with my voice, which is a very awesome, except for one fact, if I need to edit anything.

16
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:22,560
So as soon as I click my mouse inside of dictation and try and make any changes,

17
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:27,360
I lose control. And it, well, I don't lose control, but the dictation starts, stops,

18
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:33,760
and I have to start over again. And this is good. But there is better, allow me to show you better.

19
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:40,240
If we go into Google Docs, under the tools menu is voice typing. It's just kind of sitting there

20
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:47,120
like nothing special, but it is indeed something special. Let me show you how voice typing works.

21
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:52,400
Voice typing allows us to do this, we turn it on, and a little dialogue box appears that allows

22
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:56,880
a switch really, that allows us to turn it on. It'll use our computer's microphone.

23
00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:01,280
Let me put an insertion point in the document so that we can start before I turn on the

24
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:05,120
voice typing, and I'm going to put a couple returns so that we can see

25
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:10,400
exactly what it is I'm doing. Now, into this blank space here, I'm going to start typing with my

26
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:15,200
voice. And we've just seen me do that using the system level tool, so this isn't too amazing.

27
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:21,200
But it's what I do as I type that I want you to pay attention to. I am going to edit the document

28
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:26,160
on the fly as you would if you were normally typing, not just dictating and then having to stop and

29
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:34,000
start over again, but continuing to type as with my voice by making changes, highlighting text,

30
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:41,840
adding carriage returns, etc. So watch. I've now turned on the voice dictation, and as you expect,

31
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:48,720
it is accurately recording what I'm saying and converting that into text. Now, the big difference

32
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:54,480
between what I'm doing right now, comma, and what was being done with straight dictation,

33
00:02:54,480 --> 00:03:02,160
is if I click my mouse now, comma, it will not stop the system from listening, but instead,

34
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:08,240
it will allow me to interactively work with my keyboard and mouse and my voice all at the

35
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:13,040
same time. Period. New paragraph. This is straight up amazing.

36
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:26,400
Bold. I can insert and start typing again. I can add to the text. I can do basic formatting.

37
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:28,480
I can change words.

38
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:39,120
Mouse. So this allows me to interactively work with the document. Period.

39
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:50,240
New line. For me, this is a game changer. Period. New paragraph. Let me show you

40
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:54,560
some of the commands that are available to you. Now, before I talk to you about the different

41
00:03:54,640 --> 00:04:00,800
commands that are built in, I should tell you that this works on so many languages and so many

42
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:07,680
accents. Here is a list of the different languages that is supported under voice typing

43
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:12,880
and the dialects or the accents that are incorporated in those different languages.

44
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:19,280
So pretty much as far as I can tell, a vast majority of the world's languages is supported

45
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:25,600
by this technology, which again, I'm just gobstopped that Google isn't telling this to the

46
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:31,600
entire world and telling us what a great tool this is because this is pretty darned amazing.

47
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:36,560
Don't you agree? Now, you choose your language here under this dialogue box here inside of

48
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:41,920
when you open the tool, you can access the language of choice. You have to choose the

49
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:46,240
language that you're going to be working with. And I can't really tell a difference between

50
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:52,240
United States English and UK English. Maybe it's because I have a very neutral accent.

51
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:57,680
I thought it might be it does different spelling, but the spelling is set basically in your keyboard

52
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:03,600
settings, not here in this in this dialogue box. So for English, either one is probably going to

53
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:08,880
work quite well. Now, what commands do we have available? I've shown you basic punctuation,

54
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:14,160
so you know that we can do commas, paragraphs, you can end a sentence with proper punctuation,

55
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:20,640
such as a question mark, period, or an exclamation mark, period, you will notice it automatically

56
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:29,280
capitalizes the beginning of new sentences, period, new line. And we can start new sentences on new

57
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:38,240
lines or in an entirely different paragraph, period, new paragraph. And you see the formatting

58
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:44,800
carries through. Now you can also select text, and you can apply basic formatting to that text.

59
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:56,560
So let's start it up again and watch. Select formatting bold undo new line.

60
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:07,840
You can adjust font size or color. Select line. Text color red.

61
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:16,400
Make it bigger. I think you get the idea that we can do so much basic formatting,

62
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:22,080
but the concept of this interactive nature of staying on your keyboard and mouse being able to

63
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:29,520
select text, make changes verbally, and just kind of work interactively with our other input

64
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:35,440
devices, to me, as I say, I believe it's a real game changer. I'm going to share a document with

65
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:41,200
you, which will teach you all of the different commands, because you have to be specific in

66
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:46,640
the wording of the commands as you use the formatting commands to increase font sizes,

67
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:52,000
to do paragraph formatting, alignment, adjust columns to create lists. All of that is built

68
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:58,480
into the voice typing, but you do have to learn the nomenclature, and it's very simple. There will

69
00:06:58,480 --> 00:07:04,560
be a link in the description below. So I'm wondering, what do you think? Am I on point with

70
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:10,320
thinking this is a real game changer? I have started to write using this technique, and I have to say

71
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:15,200
that I feel I am far more productive, far more creative, and a little less lazy. You know,

72
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:19,440
sometimes I would think I would write a sentence and I wouldn't be entirely happy with it,

73
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:23,280
and it seems like a lot of work to go back and edit it on the keyboard. Whereas by voice,

74
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:31,120
maybe it's just me, but I am finding it a pleasure to be writing using voice typing.

75
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:35,680
For the longest time, I thought voice typing and dictation were the same thing, but I think that

76
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:41,280
we've seen here right now that they are very different, and this is available to us free

77
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:47,360
as a part of Google Docs. So try it out. Let me know in the comments what you think. Will

78
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:53,840
this have the potential to change the way that you write? Is it a huge benefit to you, or maybe it

79
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:57,280
gets in the way? Maybe you prefer being on the keyboard. I would love to hear your thoughts

80
00:07:57,280 --> 00:08:02,640
in comments below. Now, if you found this video to be useful and helpful and inspire you in any way,

81
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:06,880
well then a like and a share would be greatly appreciated, as of course, would a subscribe.

82
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:11,360
Now before we leave, I have one last thing that I want to let you know about, and that is every

83
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:16,400
week here at Dotto Tech, we host a weekly tutorial webinar called Webinar Wednesday. It's free,

84
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:21,680
it's on some aspect of productivity or content creation, and I am here by officially inviting

85
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:25,440
you to join us for an upcoming Webinar Wednesday. I hope to see you there.

86
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:34,000
Till next time, I'm Steve Dotto. Have fun storming the castle!
