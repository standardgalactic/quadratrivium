Checking dottotech/Voice Typing Changes Everything - So much more than Dictation!.txt
üéôÔ∏è **Steve Dotto on Dotto Tech:**

- Today's topic is about voice typing and how it differs from and improves upon traditional dictation software.
- Traditional dictation software, available on both Apple and Microsoft operating systems, allows users to convert speech into text. However, if you need to edit anything while using dictation, any unintended input stops the process, requiring you to start over.
- Google Docs offers a feature called "voice typing" that is more advanced. It allows users to stay on their keyboard and mouse, making it possible to select text and apply formatting changes verbally. This interactive aspect is a game changer for many users.
- Voice typing recognizes punctuation, capitalization, and can format text without requiring users to switch between voice input and traditional typing.
- Users can adjust font size, color, and other elements using specific verbal commands. A document with all the commands will be linked in the video description.
- Dotto encourages viewers to try out voice typing in Google Docs and share their thoughts in the comments. He also invites viewers to join Webinar Wednesday for more productivity and content creation tips.
- This episode emphasizes that voice typing is a free feature in Google Docs and can significantly enhance writing productivity and creativity.
