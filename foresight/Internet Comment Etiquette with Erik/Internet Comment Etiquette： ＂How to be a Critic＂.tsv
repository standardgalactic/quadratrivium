0	6300	Hey there, and welcome to Internet Comment Etiquette. I'm Eric, your host, and today I'm going to teach you how to be the best critic the Internet's ever seen.
6300	11300	Now, there's a lot of critics on the Internet. People are criticizing just about everything. Even I'm getting criticism. Look at this.
11300	15800	Please don't try short-styres. You are not talented enough, and it makes you look clumsy and cringy.
15800	19300	Pretty sure he meant to say stories there, but I've got a response nonetheless.
19300	23300	Hey, dumb shit, I don't take short story advice from people who can't spell the word stories.
23300	28700	I've jerked off the JPEGs that are smarter than you, and something tells me you're just mad because the shortest story of all is your love life.
28700	30200	And BAM! Zaptum!
37200	45200	Now, from everything I've gathered while preparing for this lesson, I've surmised that being a critic is not so much about providing helpful opinions or guidance for consumers.
45200	49700	It's more about proving that you're right, and anyone who disagrees with you doesn't know what they're talking about.
49700	56700	See, I went on to Rotten Tomatoes here, and I found this movie Suicide Squad, which has a 26% score. That's not good. That's a bad score.
56700	60200	And here's my man, Will, trying to explain why that is.
60200	64200	Rotten Tomatoes critics are just not fans of DC, unless it is directed by Christopher Nolan.
64200	66200	Blah, blah, blah. Blah, blah, blah.
66200	70700	Well, I haven't seen Suicide Squad, but I'm about to, because I'm downloading a torrent of it right now.
70700	73200	I'm gonna watch this, and then we'll come back, and I'll leave my review.
73200	78700	Well, after watching that movie, I have to disagree with my boy, Will, there. This movie was a complete piece of shit.
78700	84700	But it's not just enough to disagree with Will as an online critic. I need to make sure he feels stupid about being wrong.
84700	89200	So here we go. Yo, this review is for my man, Will. That movie sucked, bro. What are you talking about?
89200	93700	I don't know what the fuck movie you watch, but I downloaded this thing illegally and still want my money back.
93700	98700	I'm pretty sure I could beat up Jared Leto's Joker, and I've lost every fight of my life, especially against alcoholism.
98700	103200	The dialogue in this movie sounded like it was written by a YouTube spam bot for all the fucking sense it made.
103200	108700	Anyway, I'm not talented enough to write a short stire out of this, but you're wrong about this movie, and I'm taking off an extra star,
108700	112700	because there was this dude's head in the shot the entire time, and a woman in the theater wouldn't stop coughing.
112700	116700	While I'm here, I'd like to criticize 9-Eleven and say we haven't gotten the full story on what happened there.
116700	122700	Just pieces of lies and deceit. Suicide Squad, on the other hand, had virtually no story at all, and I don't give a shit what they left out there.
122700	125700	Google NWO and arm yourself against the revolution. And rip down!
125700	130700	Alright, there you go. That's how you leave a review on Rotten Tomatoes, but be careful about how you review movies,
130700	136200	because if you review them wrong, a bunch of people are gonna start an online petition to shut down Rotten Tomatoes.
136200	137700	We all know how well those work.
137700	142700	There's a disconnect between critics and audiences. You may enjoy a movie regardless what the critics say about it.
142700	147700	We must get the people to know that the criticism not the measure of the quality of the movies.
148700	154700	What? I don't know if that's a good enough reason to shut down an entire website, but he still raises an interesting point.
154700	159700	You know, critics are only as good as their own perception, and your mental mileage may vary.
159700	165700	But sometimes you get critics critiquing something before it's even out yet, like for instance this photo of Pennywise from the It remake.
165700	172700	This is a publicity still, not even a still from the movie itself, and already people are giving suggestions on how to fix the costume.
172700	179700	Yeah guys, too many ruffles and nonsense. You don't need the ankle ones or the wrist ones, or even waist one.
179700	185700	Keeping that going only. They make them look weirdly feminine and definitely not as scary. Just a thought.
185700	192700	Ah cool, nice thought. Anybody else? They're giving Pennywise too much shape and form, which is almost making him too human.
192700	194700	Oh cool, thanks man, great now!
194700	199700	But holy shit, it looks like a monster from Resident Evil or Silent Hill. Too cold!
199700	203700	Did they realize the innocence in a different time period behind Stephen King's novel?
203700	207700	Stop to make it something different and be focused more on the original one.
207700	213700	Cool, they'll do that. I'm hoping this is how he was portrayed for a second, and then switched to the baggy suit that he needs.
213700	218700	I just always felt the suit needed to be baggy for the sake of unknowingly wondering what was underneath the suit.
218700	220700	This looks like a clown, not Pennywise.
220700	221700	Wow!
221700	225700	Hey, I'm with all these assholes. I can already tell this movie's a big steaming pile of shit.
225700	231700	You should rewrite the whole third act and make the kids teenagers and set it in the 40s and make it black and white and send me the script.
231700	235700	I might have some more notes. Thanks for outsourcing the making of your movie to us Facebook commenters.
235700	238700	Just stop filming it completely until we can all agree it's what we want.
238700	241700	The kid who plays Richie is cool, but fire everyone else.
241700	244700	Also, if you need any dead dogs for the movie, I've got a backyard full of them.
244700	248700	I need to find my shovel, which I've nicknamed divorce attorney because he's very good at his job.
248700	251700	LOL, winky face, vote Jill Stein.
251700	252700	Post!
252700	255700	Well, if you think movie critics are bad, just check out video game critics.
255700	257700	There's so many of those, it'll make your head spin.
257700	270700	And we're asking for a fucking clan tag for everybody in the clan so that people will stop fucking messaging me and telling me that I'm a asshole because I'm not including them in the 100 member limit clan. Fuck!
270700	274700	Well, that's angry Joe who makes entertaining quasi-in-character reviews of video games, right?
274700	281700	Sort of plays up the harsh nature of video game culture and how angry video game fans can get over video games.
281700	283700	You know, it's a very passionate thing for them.
283700	286700	So passionate that if you fuck with them, you're gonna get death threats.
286700	288700	Did you release a video game late?
288700	289700	Oh, that's a death threat.
289700	291700	Oh, someone didn't like your review? Death threat?
291700	294700	What's this? Death threat? I don't even know what that's for.
294700	299700	I see the headline over and over again, this guy's getting a death threat, that guy's getting a death threat, here's a death threat, there's a death threat.
299700	304700	Anyway, death threats aren't exactly criticism as much as they are evidence for restraining orders.
304700	310700	So hopefully I don't get in trouble when I review this new game, No Man's Sky, that everyone's reviewing right now and I want to jump in on that.
310700	313700	Oh, we've got some pretty angry critics here.
313700	317700	Apparently the game overpromised and under-delivered, and yeah, you guessed it, they got death threats.
317700	320700	So let's see if we can find a level-headed review here.
320700	322700	Quickest refund on any purchase through Steam.
322700	326700	This is a simply matter of pulling the refund trigger as fast as you can.
326700	328700	I would not be bothered if it was free to play.
328700	332700	Well, it is free to play if you download it like me from a torrent website.
332700	335700	And there we go, let's load that game up and see what all the fuss is about.
335700	337700	Then we'll criticize.
337700	340700	This is a weird shooter, these animals aren't fighting back at all.
346700	348700	Oh, cool, you can feed the animals.
348700	351700	Hey, it's my buddy, he's got a little smiley face on his head now, and murder.
353700	355700	Alright, let's bury him.
356700	381700	Okay, I think I killed everything on this planet, let's hit the next one.
381700	383700	I love how you can fly under stuff.
383700	389700	Alright, really cool game, let's see if I can cut through this pure concentrated rage going on here and leave some thoughtful criticism.
389700	394700	Downloaded this game illegally and played it for about two hours, so I think I can speak for everyone when I say it was awesome.
394700	397700	Best free to play game of the year, but the real game here is life itself,
397700	401700	because we're all inside a simulation run by the Illuminati Singularity Machine.
401700	403700	Why do you think they turned the Matrix directors into women?
403700	404700	They got too close to the truth.
404700	408700	However, I found a cheat code that allows me to run an illegal vet practice out of my basement.
408700	412700	I've got more baby kittens and jars down there than a Japanese freak show.
412700	417700	I hope we never wake up from this false reality because I make a shitload of money throwing people's animals into the lake behind my house.
417700	421700	I give life the game a 5 out of 5 and send me a PM if you've got a dog problem.
421700	422700	And BOOST!
422700	426700	Alright, well you don't even have to be an aficionado in anything to leave criticism.
426700	432700	Just take a look at here, we're on Twitter, Ellen DeGeneres called a bunch of criticism for photoshopping yourself onto Usain Bolt's back.
432700	434700	Pretty harmless tweet, right? WRONG!
434700	438700	So riding on his back like a mule, a horse, as some form of property is fun to use.
438700	440700	The most thing that pops in your head when looking at this pic is,
440700	443700	Oh, let me jump onto his back like he's a common mule.
443700	447700	Dear, at the Ellen Show, whatever intern thought this tweet was a good idea should be fired.
447700	448700	Immediately.
448700	452700	This is terrible, there should be at least a public apology at least.
452700	456700	Well, I guess these people ran out of actual racist things to complain about online,
456700	458700	so they decided to focus on Ellen DeGeneres.
458700	461700	Well, I had no idea it was racist until I saw all these tweets.
461700	465700	And you know, of these people being critics, there's no way they're wrong, so how could I argue?
465700	469700	What I can do is I can fix the situation in a way that makes everyone happy.
469700	473700	With this photo shopped, it just gives a little more context.
473700	476700	Hey guys, I fixed that photo and tweet!
476700	477700	Yeah, there we go.
477700	479700	That's no longer a race issue anymore.
479700	483700	Unless you're talking about the people riding on your back race going on in this picture.
483700	487700	Alright, now what other kind of critics are out there and how do we become them?
487700	488700	Oh, what about art critics?
488700	491700	If we're gonna be an art critic, then you know we gotta go to Tumblr.
491700	492700	Woo, man, Tumblr.
492700	496700	Tumblr is home to some of the harshest critics on the entire internet.
496700	501700	Like, for instance, when a bunch of enraged fans of the show Steven Universe almost drove the girl to suicide
501700	503700	because she was drawing one of the characters as too thin,
503700	509700	among other supposedly problematic pieces of fan art for a kid's show that preaches tolerance and friendship.
509700	511700	Here's a woman dressed up as a character from the show,
511700	514700	a purple alien born from a gemstone or some shit,
514700	515700	and here's the response she got.
515700	517700	Why do white people cosplay characters of color?
517700	520700	Well, this person's half-right and that purple is a color,
520700	524700	but if you think the Steven Universe fans are the worst part about Tumblr, you'd be absolutely wrong.
524700	527700	This website is a complete haven for people who hate to be singled out
527700	529700	yet spend all their time singling out other people.
529700	530700	Check this out.
530700	531700	Please don't eat Mexican food.
531700	532700	It is not in your heritage.
532700	535700	Consumption of foreign foods is cultural appropriation.
535700	537700	Stop messaging me about the death threats I said yesterday.
537700	539700	I was triggered and had an episode.
539700	540700	So get off my back, please.
540700	542700	Can we get rid of the concept of common sense?
542700	545700	Trying to write a joke that won't offend anyone on Tumblr.
545700	547700	There's a little lady going through a laser maze there.
547700	549700	This is the worst post I've ever seen.
549700	552700	You have trouble making jokes that aren't racist, homophobic, or misogynistic
552700	553700	and you aren't funny, actually.
553700	556700	This was a joke that's not racist, homophobic, or misogynistic.
556700	557700	You had offended.
557700	559700	I give Tumblr a one out of five,
559700	562700	and I'm never going back to this stupid fucking website again.
562700	567700	But I'm gonna leave this picture of Steven Universe riding on Usain Bolt's back,
567700	569700	and we'll just see what happens.
569700	570700	Moving along.
570700	572700	Alright, now let's find out how to be a restaurant critic.
572700	573700	Let's see.
573700	575700	Here's one of my favorite restaurant critics on YouTube.
575700	577700	The report of the week.
577700	580700	This strapping young man goes out of his way to review fast food items.
580700	583700	In this case, a waparito from Burger King.
583700	586700	So the waparito from Burger King going in.
586700	588700	Yeah, buddy.
588700	591700	Tastes better than I thought, but my god, does that not look appetizing right there?
591700	593700	That beef on the left.
593700	596700	Well, that just looks like it's diseased or something.
596700	599700	Now this is a critic who conveys proper and respectful etiquette.
599700	601700	The best way to describe it, really, when you're biting it in,
601700	603700	is that it's indistinguishable from a wapar.
603700	605700	How does this guy not have a million subscribers?
605700	608700	It was a rough night, but I was just now thinking nonstop about the waparito,
608700	611700	and I was just thinking, you know, would it taste any different?
611700	612700	I don't know.
612700	614700	Crazy stuff, right?
614700	615700	Excellent.
615700	616700	Excellent review, sir.
616700	620700	I'm gonna leave this guy a comment to let him know that fellow etiquetteers appreciate his style.
620700	623700	I caught this guy fucking my girlfriend last week.
623700	625700	I'm still pissed about it, but there's nothing I can do.
625700	626700	She loves him.
626700	628700	I knew she was acting weird because she kept staying out late
628700	630700	and coming home with taco sauce on her blouse.
630700	632700	During sex, she'd scream to give her my $5 foot long,
632700	635700	but I'm only three inches and $5 is way too much for what I'm giving.
635700	638700	One day, I came home to find her getting plowed against the wall by this dude.
638700	641700	He had her hair in one hand and a taco bell, cheesy gordita crunch in the other.
641700	645700	I tried to fight him, but he slapped me so hard it broke every window in the house.
645700	647700	This dude's a stone cold pimp, and I can't do anything to hurt him,
647700	650700	so I can only hope he breaks her heart one day like she broke mine.
650700	653700	Subscribe, then I would really love to see a review on the Baconator from Wendy's.
653700	654700	Thanks.
654700	655700	And r-
655700	656700	Yeah!
656700	658700	Daddy, can I be a critic, too?
658700	659700	You wanna be a critic?
659700	660700	Sure, man.
660700	661700	What do you want to critique?
661700	662700	Books.
662700	663700	That's great.
663700	664700	I didn't cover that in my video at all.
664700	665700	But, uh, yeah.
665700	666700	Pick a book.
666700	667700	Review it.
667700	669700	Okay, I choose Ann Coulter's new book in Trump We Trust.
669700	670700	All right, man.
670700	672700	We'll just keep it civil, you know what I mean?
672700	676700	I thought this bitch was a Jew at first, so I almost didn't buy this book,
676700	679700	but then I realized she hates Mexicans almost as much as I do.
679700	680700	Oh, robot!
680700	681700	Anyway, good book.
681700	684700	I can't wait to read it to the next black guy I meet.
684700	685700	Robot!
685700	686700	Four out of five.
686700	687700	The South will rise again.
687700	688700	Do not post that!
688700	689700	And...
689700	690700	Do not post that!
690700	691700	Post!
691700	692700	God damn it!
692700	693700	Come here!
693700	701700	Oh, thank God the plant broke my fall.
701700	702700	That wasn't that bad.
702700	703700	Ow!
703700	704700	Ow!
704700	705700	Ow!
