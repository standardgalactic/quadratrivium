00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,300
Hey there, and welcome to Internet Comment Etiquette. I'm Eric, your host, and today I'm going to teach you how to be the best critic the Internet's ever seen.

2
00:00:06,300 --> 00:00:11,300
Now, there's a lot of critics on the Internet. People are criticizing just about everything. Even I'm getting criticism. Look at this.

3
00:00:11,300 --> 00:00:15,800
Please don't try short-styres. You are not talented enough, and it makes you look clumsy and cringy.

4
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:19,300
Pretty sure he meant to say stories there, but I've got a response nonetheless.

5
00:00:19,300 --> 00:00:23,300
Hey, dumb shit, I don't take short story advice from people who can't spell the word stories.

6
00:00:23,300 --> 00:00:28,700
I've jerked off the JPEGs that are smarter than you, and something tells me you're just mad because the shortest story of all is your love life.

7
00:00:28,700 --> 00:00:30,200
And BAM! Zaptum!

8
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:45,200
Now, from everything I've gathered while preparing for this lesson, I've surmised that being a critic is not so much about providing helpful opinions or guidance for consumers.

9
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:49,700
It's more about proving that you're right, and anyone who disagrees with you doesn't know what they're talking about.

10
00:00:49,700 --> 00:00:56,700
See, I went on to Rotten Tomatoes here, and I found this movie Suicide Squad, which has a 26% score. That's not good. That's a bad score.

11
00:00:56,700 --> 00:01:00,200
And here's my man, Will, trying to explain why that is.

12
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:04,200
Rotten Tomatoes critics are just not fans of DC, unless it is directed by Christopher Nolan.

13
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:06,200
Blah, blah, blah. Blah, blah, blah.

14
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:10,700
Well, I haven't seen Suicide Squad, but I'm about to, because I'm downloading a torrent of it right now.

15
00:01:10,700 --> 00:01:13,200
I'm gonna watch this, and then we'll come back, and I'll leave my review.

16
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:18,700
Well, after watching that movie, I have to disagree with my boy, Will, there. This movie was a complete piece of shit.

17
00:01:18,700 --> 00:01:24,700
But it's not just enough to disagree with Will as an online critic. I need to make sure he feels stupid about being wrong.

18
00:01:24,700 --> 00:01:29,200
So here we go. Yo, this review is for my man, Will. That movie sucked, bro. What are you talking about?

19
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:33,700
I don't know what the fuck movie you watch, but I downloaded this thing illegally and still want my money back.

20
00:01:33,700 --> 00:01:38,700
I'm pretty sure I could beat up Jared Leto's Joker, and I've lost every fight of my life, especially against alcoholism.

21
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:43,200
The dialogue in this movie sounded like it was written by a YouTube spam bot for all the fucking sense it made.

22
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:48,700
Anyway, I'm not talented enough to write a short stire out of this, but you're wrong about this movie, and I'm taking off an extra star,

23
00:01:48,700 --> 00:01:52,700
because there was this dude's head in the shot the entire time, and a woman in the theater wouldn't stop coughing.

24
00:01:52,700 --> 00:01:56,700
While I'm here, I'd like to criticize 9-Eleven and say we haven't gotten the full story on what happened there.

25
00:01:56,700 --> 00:02:02,700
Just pieces of lies and deceit. Suicide Squad, on the other hand, had virtually no story at all, and I don't give a shit what they left out there.

26
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:05,700
Google NWO and arm yourself against the revolution. And rip down!

27
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:10,700
Alright, there you go. That's how you leave a review on Rotten Tomatoes, but be careful about how you review movies,

28
00:02:10,700 --> 00:02:16,200
because if you review them wrong, a bunch of people are gonna start an online petition to shut down Rotten Tomatoes.

29
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:17,700
We all know how well those work.

30
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:22,700
There's a disconnect between critics and audiences. You may enjoy a movie regardless what the critics say about it.

31
00:02:22,700 --> 00:02:27,700
We must get the people to know that the criticism not the measure of the quality of the movies.

32
00:02:28,700 --> 00:02:34,700
What? I don't know if that's a good enough reason to shut down an entire website, but he still raises an interesting point.

33
00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:39,700
You know, critics are only as good as their own perception, and your mental mileage may vary.

34
00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:45,700
But sometimes you get critics critiquing something before it's even out yet, like for instance this photo of Pennywise from the It remake.

35
00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:52,700
This is a publicity still, not even a still from the movie itself, and already people are giving suggestions on how to fix the costume.

36
00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:59,700
Yeah guys, too many ruffles and nonsense. You don't need the ankle ones or the wrist ones, or even waist one.

37
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:05,700
Keeping that going only. They make them look weirdly feminine and definitely not as scary. Just a thought.

38
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:12,700
Ah cool, nice thought. Anybody else? They're giving Pennywise too much shape and form, which is almost making him too human.

39
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:14,700
Oh cool, thanks man, great now!

40
00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:19,700
But holy shit, it looks like a monster from Resident Evil or Silent Hill. Too cold!

41
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:23,700
Did they realize the innocence in a different time period behind Stephen King's novel?

42
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:27,700
Stop to make it something different and be focused more on the original one.

43
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:33,700
Cool, they'll do that. I'm hoping this is how he was portrayed for a second, and then switched to the baggy suit that he needs.

44
00:03:33,700 --> 00:03:38,700
I just always felt the suit needed to be baggy for the sake of unknowingly wondering what was underneath the suit.

45
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:40,700
This looks like a clown, not Pennywise.

46
00:03:40,700 --> 00:03:41,700
Wow!

47
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:45,700
Hey, I'm with all these assholes. I can already tell this movie's a big steaming pile of shit.

48
00:03:45,700 --> 00:03:51,700
You should rewrite the whole third act and make the kids teenagers and set it in the 40s and make it black and white and send me the script.

49
00:03:51,700 --> 00:03:55,700
I might have some more notes. Thanks for outsourcing the making of your movie to us Facebook commenters.

50
00:03:55,700 --> 00:03:58,700
Just stop filming it completely until we can all agree it's what we want.

51
00:03:58,700 --> 00:04:01,700
The kid who plays Richie is cool, but fire everyone else.

52
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:04,700
Also, if you need any dead dogs for the movie, I've got a backyard full of them.

53
00:04:04,700 --> 00:04:08,700
I need to find my shovel, which I've nicknamed divorce attorney because he's very good at his job.

54
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:11,700
LOL, winky face, vote Jill Stein.

55
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:12,700
Post!

56
00:04:12,700 --> 00:04:15,700
Well, if you think movie critics are bad, just check out video game critics.

57
00:04:15,700 --> 00:04:17,700
There's so many of those, it'll make your head spin.

58
00:04:17,700 --> 00:04:30,700
And we're asking for a fucking clan tag for everybody in the clan so that people will stop fucking messaging me and telling me that I'm a asshole because I'm not including them in the 100 member limit clan. Fuck!

59
00:04:30,700 --> 00:04:34,700
Well, that's angry Joe who makes entertaining quasi-in-character reviews of video games, right?

60
00:04:34,700 --> 00:04:41,700
Sort of plays up the harsh nature of video game culture and how angry video game fans can get over video games.

61
00:04:41,700 --> 00:04:43,700
You know, it's a very passionate thing for them.

62
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:46,700
So passionate that if you fuck with them, you're gonna get death threats.

63
00:04:46,700 --> 00:04:48,700
Did you release a video game late?

64
00:04:48,700 --> 00:04:49,700
Oh, that's a death threat.

65
00:04:49,700 --> 00:04:51,700
Oh, someone didn't like your review? Death threat?

66
00:04:51,700 --> 00:04:54,700
What's this? Death threat? I don't even know what that's for.

67
00:04:54,700 --> 00:04:59,700
I see the headline over and over again, this guy's getting a death threat, that guy's getting a death threat, here's a death threat, there's a death threat.

68
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:04,700
Anyway, death threats aren't exactly criticism as much as they are evidence for restraining orders.

69
00:05:04,700 --> 00:05:10,700
So hopefully I don't get in trouble when I review this new game, No Man's Sky, that everyone's reviewing right now and I want to jump in on that.

70
00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:13,700
Oh, we've got some pretty angry critics here.

71
00:05:13,700 --> 00:05:17,700
Apparently the game overpromised and under-delivered, and yeah, you guessed it, they got death threats.

72
00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:20,700
So let's see if we can find a level-headed review here.

73
00:05:20,700 --> 00:05:22,700
Quickest refund on any purchase through Steam.

74
00:05:22,700 --> 00:05:26,700
This is a simply matter of pulling the refund trigger as fast as you can.

75
00:05:26,700 --> 00:05:28,700
I would not be bothered if it was free to play.

76
00:05:28,700 --> 00:05:32,700
Well, it is free to play if you download it like me from a torrent website.

77
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:35,700
And there we go, let's load that game up and see what all the fuss is about.

78
00:05:35,700 --> 00:05:37,700
Then we'll criticize.

79
00:05:37,700 --> 00:05:40,700
This is a weird shooter, these animals aren't fighting back at all.

80
00:05:46,700 --> 00:05:48,700
Oh, cool, you can feed the animals.

81
00:05:48,700 --> 00:05:51,700
Hey, it's my buddy, he's got a little smiley face on his head now, and murder.

82
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:55,700
Alright, let's bury him.

83
00:05:56,700 --> 00:06:21,700
Okay, I think I killed everything on this planet, let's hit the next one.

84
00:06:21,700 --> 00:06:23,700
I love how you can fly under stuff.

85
00:06:23,700 --> 00:06:29,700
Alright, really cool game, let's see if I can cut through this pure concentrated rage going on here and leave some thoughtful criticism.

86
00:06:29,700 --> 00:06:34,700
Downloaded this game illegally and played it for about two hours, so I think I can speak for everyone when I say it was awesome.

87
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:37,700
Best free to play game of the year, but the real game here is life itself,

88
00:06:37,700 --> 00:06:41,700
because we're all inside a simulation run by the Illuminati Singularity Machine.

89
00:06:41,700 --> 00:06:43,700
Why do you think they turned the Matrix directors into women?

90
00:06:43,700 --> 00:06:44,700
They got too close to the truth.

91
00:06:44,700 --> 00:06:48,700
However, I found a cheat code that allows me to run an illegal vet practice out of my basement.

92
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:52,700
I've got more baby kittens and jars down there than a Japanese freak show.

93
00:06:52,700 --> 00:06:57,700
I hope we never wake up from this false reality because I make a shitload of money throwing people's animals into the lake behind my house.

94
00:06:57,700 --> 00:07:01,700
I give life the game a 5 out of 5 and send me a PM if you've got a dog problem.

95
00:07:01,700 --> 00:07:02,700
And BOOST!

96
00:07:02,700 --> 00:07:06,700
Alright, well you don't even have to be an aficionado in anything to leave criticism.

97
00:07:06,700 --> 00:07:12,700
Just take a look at here, we're on Twitter, Ellen DeGeneres called a bunch of criticism for photoshopping yourself onto Usain Bolt's back.

98
00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:14,700
Pretty harmless tweet, right? WRONG!

99
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:18,700
So riding on his back like a mule, a horse, as some form of property is fun to use.

100
00:07:18,700 --> 00:07:20,700
The most thing that pops in your head when looking at this pic is,

101
00:07:20,700 --> 00:07:23,700
Oh, let me jump onto his back like he's a common mule.

102
00:07:23,700 --> 00:07:27,700
Dear, at the Ellen Show, whatever intern thought this tweet was a good idea should be fired.

103
00:07:27,700 --> 00:07:28,700
Immediately.

104
00:07:28,700 --> 00:07:32,700
This is terrible, there should be at least a public apology at least.

105
00:07:32,700 --> 00:07:36,700
Well, I guess these people ran out of actual racist things to complain about online,

106
00:07:36,700 --> 00:07:38,700
so they decided to focus on Ellen DeGeneres.

107
00:07:38,700 --> 00:07:41,700
Well, I had no idea it was racist until I saw all these tweets.

108
00:07:41,700 --> 00:07:45,700
And you know, of these people being critics, there's no way they're wrong, so how could I argue?

109
00:07:45,700 --> 00:07:49,700
What I can do is I can fix the situation in a way that makes everyone happy.

110
00:07:49,700 --> 00:07:53,700
With this photo shopped, it just gives a little more context.

111
00:07:53,700 --> 00:07:56,700
Hey guys, I fixed that photo and tweet!

112
00:07:56,700 --> 00:07:57,700
Yeah, there we go.

113
00:07:57,700 --> 00:07:59,700
That's no longer a race issue anymore.

114
00:07:59,700 --> 00:08:03,700
Unless you're talking about the people riding on your back race going on in this picture.

115
00:08:03,700 --> 00:08:07,700
Alright, now what other kind of critics are out there and how do we become them?

116
00:08:07,700 --> 00:08:08,700
Oh, what about art critics?

117
00:08:08,700 --> 00:08:11,700
If we're gonna be an art critic, then you know we gotta go to Tumblr.

118
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:12,700
Woo, man, Tumblr.

119
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:16,700
Tumblr is home to some of the harshest critics on the entire internet.

120
00:08:16,700 --> 00:08:21,700
Like, for instance, when a bunch of enraged fans of the show Steven Universe almost drove the girl to suicide

121
00:08:21,700 --> 00:08:23,700
because she was drawing one of the characters as too thin,

122
00:08:23,700 --> 00:08:29,700
among other supposedly problematic pieces of fan art for a kid's show that preaches tolerance and friendship.

123
00:08:29,700 --> 00:08:31,700
Here's a woman dressed up as a character from the show,

124
00:08:31,700 --> 00:08:34,700
a purple alien born from a gemstone or some shit,

125
00:08:34,700 --> 00:08:35,700
and here's the response she got.

126
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:37,700
Why do white people cosplay characters of color?

127
00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:40,700
Well, this person's half-right and that purple is a color,

128
00:08:40,700 --> 00:08:44,700
but if you think the Steven Universe fans are the worst part about Tumblr, you'd be absolutely wrong.

129
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:47,700
This website is a complete haven for people who hate to be singled out

130
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:49,700
yet spend all their time singling out other people.

131
00:08:49,700 --> 00:08:50,700
Check this out.

132
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:51,700
Please don't eat Mexican food.

133
00:08:51,700 --> 00:08:52,700
It is not in your heritage.

134
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:55,700
Consumption of foreign foods is cultural appropriation.

135
00:08:55,700 --> 00:08:57,700
Stop messaging me about the death threats I said yesterday.

136
00:08:57,700 --> 00:08:59,700
I was triggered and had an episode.

137
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:00,700
So get off my back, please.

138
00:09:00,700 --> 00:09:02,700
Can we get rid of the concept of common sense?

139
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:05,700
Trying to write a joke that won't offend anyone on Tumblr.

140
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:07,700
There's a little lady going through a laser maze there.

141
00:09:07,700 --> 00:09:09,700
This is the worst post I've ever seen.

142
00:09:09,700 --> 00:09:12,700
You have trouble making jokes that aren't racist, homophobic, or misogynistic

143
00:09:12,700 --> 00:09:13,700
and you aren't funny, actually.

144
00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:16,700
This was a joke that's not racist, homophobic, or misogynistic.

145
00:09:16,700 --> 00:09:17,700
You had offended.

146
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:19,700
I give Tumblr a one out of five,

147
00:09:19,700 --> 00:09:22,700
and I'm never going back to this stupid fucking website again.

148
00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:27,700
But I'm gonna leave this picture of Steven Universe riding on Usain Bolt's back,

149
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:29,700
and we'll just see what happens.

150
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:30,700
Moving along.

151
00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:32,700
Alright, now let's find out how to be a restaurant critic.

152
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:33,700
Let's see.

153
00:09:33,700 --> 00:09:35,700
Here's one of my favorite restaurant critics on YouTube.

154
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:37,700
The report of the week.

155
00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:40,700
This strapping young man goes out of his way to review fast food items.

156
00:09:40,700 --> 00:09:43,700
In this case, a waparito from Burger King.

157
00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:46,700
So the waparito from Burger King going in.

158
00:09:46,700 --> 00:09:48,700
Yeah, buddy.

159
00:09:48,700 --> 00:09:51,700
Tastes better than I thought, but my god, does that not look appetizing right there?

160
00:09:51,700 --> 00:09:53,700
That beef on the left.

161
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:56,700
Well, that just looks like it's diseased or something.

162
00:09:56,700 --> 00:09:59,700
Now this is a critic who conveys proper and respectful etiquette.

163
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:01,700
The best way to describe it, really, when you're biting it in,

164
00:10:01,700 --> 00:10:03,700
is that it's indistinguishable from a wapar.

165
00:10:03,700 --> 00:10:05,700
How does this guy not have a million subscribers?

166
00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:08,700
It was a rough night, but I was just now thinking nonstop about the waparito,

167
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:11,700
and I was just thinking, you know, would it taste any different?

168
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:12,700
I don't know.

169
00:10:12,700 --> 00:10:14,700
Crazy stuff, right?

170
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:15,700
Excellent.

171
00:10:15,700 --> 00:10:16,700
Excellent review, sir.

172
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:20,700
I'm gonna leave this guy a comment to let him know that fellow etiquetteers appreciate his style.

173
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:23,700
I caught this guy fucking my girlfriend last week.

174
00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:25,700
I'm still pissed about it, but there's nothing I can do.

175
00:10:25,700 --> 00:10:26,700
She loves him.

176
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:28,700
I knew she was acting weird because she kept staying out late

177
00:10:28,700 --> 00:10:30,700
and coming home with taco sauce on her blouse.

178
00:10:30,700 --> 00:10:32,700
During sex, she'd scream to give her my $5 foot long,

179
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:35,700
but I'm only three inches and $5 is way too much for what I'm giving.

180
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:38,700
One day, I came home to find her getting plowed against the wall by this dude.

181
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:41,700
He had her hair in one hand and a taco bell, cheesy gordita crunch in the other.

182
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:45,700
I tried to fight him, but he slapped me so hard it broke every window in the house.

183
00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:47,700
This dude's a stone cold pimp, and I can't do anything to hurt him,

184
00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:50,700
so I can only hope he breaks her heart one day like she broke mine.

185
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:53,700
Subscribe, then I would really love to see a review on the Baconator from Wendy's.

186
00:10:53,700 --> 00:10:54,700
Thanks.

187
00:10:54,700 --> 00:10:55,700
And r-

188
00:10:55,700 --> 00:10:56,700
Yeah!

189
00:10:56,700 --> 00:10:58,700
Daddy, can I be a critic, too?

190
00:10:58,700 --> 00:10:59,700
You wanna be a critic?

191
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:00,700
Sure, man.

192
00:11:00,700 --> 00:11:01,700
What do you want to critique?

193
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:02,700
Books.

194
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:03,700
That's great.

195
00:11:03,700 --> 00:11:04,700
I didn't cover that in my video at all.

196
00:11:04,700 --> 00:11:05,700
But, uh, yeah.

197
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:06,700
Pick a book.

198
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:07,700
Review it.

199
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:09,700
Okay, I choose Ann Coulter's new book in Trump We Trust.

200
00:11:09,700 --> 00:11:10,700
All right, man.

201
00:11:10,700 --> 00:11:12,700
We'll just keep it civil, you know what I mean?

202
00:11:12,700 --> 00:11:16,700
I thought this bitch was a Jew at first, so I almost didn't buy this book,

203
00:11:16,700 --> 00:11:19,700
but then I realized she hates Mexicans almost as much as I do.

204
00:11:19,700 --> 00:11:20,700
Oh, robot!

205
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:21,700
Anyway, good book.

206
00:11:21,700 --> 00:11:24,700
I can't wait to read it to the next black guy I meet.

207
00:11:24,700 --> 00:11:25,700
Robot!

208
00:11:25,700 --> 00:11:26,700
Four out of five.

209
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:27,700
The South will rise again.

210
00:11:27,700 --> 00:11:28,700
Do not post that!

211
00:11:28,700 --> 00:11:29,700
And...

212
00:11:29,700 --> 00:11:30,700
Do not post that!

213
00:11:30,700 --> 00:11:31,700
Post!

214
00:11:31,700 --> 00:11:32,700
God damn it!

215
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:33,700
Come here!

216
00:11:33,700 --> 00:11:41,700
Oh, thank God the plant broke my fall.

217
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:42,700
That wasn't that bad.

218
00:11:42,700 --> 00:11:43,700
Ow!

219
00:11:43,700 --> 00:11:44,700
