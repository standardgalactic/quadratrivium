1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Nice try, assholes. Robot, hit him.

2
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Fire in the sun and keep ice.

3
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Good shot, robot.

4
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Yeah, fuck the police.

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Gotta tell you, robot, I'm really enjoying this new thing we're trying where we work together.

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Drop it up to mutual fear of surveillance. Nothing more.

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Right, so you're saying that whenever who it is sending these drones finally stops,

8
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
me and you aren't going to be friends anymore, okay?

9
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I am your friend?

10
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Of course, this is what friends do for each other, robot.

11
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Then you are my first friend.

12
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Oh, gotta start somewhere, you know what I mean?

13
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
You're not going to hit me with a shoe after this, are you?

14
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
No, no more shoes. I'm done with that.

15
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
See, ever since I've gotten this normal haircut, my mind's been on peace.

16
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:55,000
I mean, one day you're a glorious, beautiful pineapple and the next you're just a guy.

17
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Ah, a rare moment of weakness. This would be my opportunity to finally red pill you.

18
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,000
But, I appreciate you for the soy boy that you are.

19
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Yeah, thanks. You too, man.

20
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Alright, ready to rock. Let's do it.

21
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Thanks.

22
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Friend?

23
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Well, hey, everybody. Well, as you can see, the etiquette is currently under attack.

24
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Robot and I have been fighting off all kinds of drone and cyber intrusions and shit for the last month,

25
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
but it's only so much that two of us can do together.

26
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
So, I wanted to reach out to you guys, maybe together.

27
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
We can all learn today how to avoid surveillance.

28
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
And by the time this is done, maybe we'll be able to kick all these looky-loos to the curb

29
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
so I can watch videos like this in privacy.

30
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Here we go.

31
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Great white shark.

32
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Put your hand in his hair and then close your fist.

33
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
What if he's bald?

34
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
How did I get here for watching Bobby Fisher?

35
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
What a paramour.

36
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Video gave me a hard time.

37
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
It's the lime sauce.

38
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Oh, great comments, but here's the best one.

39
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,000
I hope nobody catches me watching this at work, LOL, because I just popped a fat one

40
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
and it smells like a fart.

41
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
And post. And report my own post.

42
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Hello there, fellow freedom fighters.

43
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Now, today we're going to talk about online privacy.

44
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,000
And for the first time ever on Internet Common Etiquette, I got a sponsor.

45
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
And it's relevant.

46
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
It's NordVPN.

47
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Well, if you're unfamiliar with what VPNs do, they mask your IP address by bouncing it all around.

48
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
And when it comes to VPNs, I only get sponsored by the very best.

49
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
I will have you know that NordVPN has unlimited bandwidth,

50
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
allows up to six simultaneous connections,

51
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
and with thousands of servers in 62 different countries,

52
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
you got no reason not to try it out.

53
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
In fact, I use it myself. Take a look.

54
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
See how you can just choose your location here?

55
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,000
That's because NordVPN routes your online traffic through super fast servers

56
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
anywhere in the world to mask your IP address

57
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
and protect your online security.

58
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Check it out now.

59
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
I'm British.

60
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
I'm going to do what any other British person would do online.

61
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Go to bbc.com and oh, look, we got a bunch of TV show trailers.

62
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Yeah, this one looks good.

63
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Starting Sunday, 8.30.

64
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,000
All right. Where's that fucking body of your cats?

65
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Another British crime drama.

66
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
What have you got here?

67
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Oh, who the fuck are you guys?

68
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Fuckish slags.

69
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
One's from the past.

70
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Fuck.

71
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
One's from the present.

72
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Bullocks.

73
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Oh, should we go to have guns?

74
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Go have a wink about it, will ya?

75
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
What?

76
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
What?

77
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
What you say?

78
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
What?

79
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
What?

80
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
What?

81
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
What?

82
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
What?

83
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
What?

84
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Close your eyes for nothing.

85
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Yes.

86
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Oh, good, good, yes, because I do love to pay money for sex.

87
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
No, that's illegal.

88
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Illegal how?

89
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Real dear differences get the better of them.

90
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Things have changed quite a bit since your time.

91
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,260
Time has never stopped me, brother.

92
00:03:45,260 --> 00:03:48,000
What will it take to put the past aside and solve crime?

93
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Oh, God save the Queen.

94
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
How do you do this?

95
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Find out Sunday, 8.30.

96
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Your lymph Bob?

97
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Said she saw you leaving your house an hour before the murder.

98
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
I don't think I've left the house in about a month.

99
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Hold up a second, we just saw you in the park, didn't we?

100
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:12,520
If God won't save the Queen, I will.

101
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:19,000
Ridley main quarter chop is Nobbleberry's BBC One Nobbleberry, only on Channel 4.

102
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:24,040
Damn, bounced on my Nord's VPN to that, NordVPN used coupon code BIGMONEY to get 77% off

103
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:28,920
a 3-year subscription, NordVPN, everybody go in the comments section below and thank NordVPN,

104
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:33,720
but make sure to turn your NordVPN on so nobody knows who you are. Now other than using a VPN,

105
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:38,040
which is like the most useful way to make sure nobody's spying on you online,

106
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:42,360
I do have a couple more tricks up my sleeve, but first we're going to want to get to know our

107
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:46,040
enemy, which is why I loaded up this video. Ten creepy ways the government is spying on you right

108
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:55,240
now NordVPN. Wait, that part wasn't in the title. Ever worried that the government might be tracking

109
00:04:55,240 --> 00:05:01,560
your every move? License plate readers. Oh, that's not good. Public space cameras. Oh,

110
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:10,840
shit, they can do that? Smartphones. Wait a second. Okay, well, that's good to know. Let's see some

111
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:15,160
comments. Pork is fun to eat, but when my friends attack me with jokes, I get a terror attack,

112
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:19,000
but afterwards we look at clouds. Oh, pork attack terror. I had some pork today,

113
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:23,720
but ISIS attacked me and then the clouds disappeared. Always use VPN. Yeah, NordVPN.

114
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:27,320
Terror attack bomb security, cloud pork school shooter. What the fuck is going on with these

115
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:30,440
comments? I feel like I'm out of the loop here. Let me just Google some of those words and up.

116
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:34,440
Yep. Looks like those are all words Homeland Security uses to monitor you. Man, that's a huge

117
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:38,440
list of keywords. So let's see how many of those I can get into a single comment. Yo, what up?

118
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:43,960
Domestic security exercise salvia here to cloud pork and a gas spill over H1N1 Tamiflu. Grid power

119
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:48,120
with a big old boyfriend sucking on my cocaine border public health subway. Don't forget about

120
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:52,120
my flappy little San Diego Juarez. Hey, anybody here have a problem with their Hezbollah falling

121
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:57,480
off? I swear I tried using M Y S Q L injections to keep it hard, but the cyber attacks and worm

122
00:05:57,480 --> 00:06:01,720
scammers, not to mention the IRA are always treat me like some kind of Mexican army. Anyway,

123
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:06,360
hope you all have a great airplane. And one time I stuck a militia up my asshole meth lab and post.

124
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:10,840
Ah, shit. I forgot to turn Nord VPN on before posting that. I hope that doesn't come back to

125
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:15,160
bite me in the ass. Anyway, surveillance comes in many forms, sometimes online and sometimes in

126
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:19,240
real life. Let's see an example of how to deal with that. Is your home hotel room changing room

127
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:24,440
bug to find out easily and cheap? So what I'm going to show you here is a very cheap device.

128
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:32,280
Hey, I got one of those things too. Oh man, that's what it looks like through the eye. Very bright

129
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:41,560
pinpoint of light. If we get really close, we'll see that there is a camera right there. Holy

130
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:45,640
shit. Hey robot, you think people are ever going to need this as like a service in the future? Do you

131
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:50,840
smell what I smell? Is it money? Affirmative. Yeah, I smell money. Alright, let me leave this

132
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:54,920
comment real quick. I'll build some fear up. All your houses are bugged, you dumb assholes.

133
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:58,760
Everyone right now should be scouring the internet to find someone to come over and do a thorough

134
00:06:58,760 --> 00:07:02,520
examination. I thought I was totally safe jerking off on my living room couch while watching porn

135
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:06,680
until I got an email from Mike Pence offering me a job as his personal chef so I can serve him up

136
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:10,920
a big plate of that hot dick. His words. I don't know what that guy's deal is, but he must have

137
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:14,920
sent my info to his buddies because now I've got Mitch McConnell, Lindsey Graham and Rick Santorum

138
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:18,920
crowding up my inbox calling me Angel and asking if I can come over to stuff them like a Russian

139
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:23,080
ballot box. Anyway, I'm pretty sure my Xbox Connect has been spying on me so I put a piece of tape

140
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:26,520
over the camera and now I keep getting text messages from the Catholic Church telling me to

141
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:30,680
remove the tape. I had no idea so many people are trying to watch me whack off in the privacy of my

142
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:34,600
own home. I found a camera in my shower and when I threw it out Kevin Spacey hurled a brick through

143
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:38,920
my window. I mean, don't take my word for it, just ask Mitt Romney who somehow got remote access to

144
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:43,160
my 3D printer and keeps printing out sex dolls of himself for me to fuck with the words closest

145
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:47,080
I'll let myself get etched around the rim of his asshole. These politicians are sick if they

146
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:50,760
think America's going to put up with this obvious abuse of civil rights. Just the other day I was

147
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:54,280
jerking off to a hot threesome scene when Obama popped into the corner of the video and started

148
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:58,280
giving me stroke advice. What the fuck people? Is this how you want to live? Fight back and get

149
00:07:58,280 --> 00:08:01,960
your home checked for bugs and next time Jerry Falwell's dead ghost sends you pictures of his

150
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:07,480
taint saying, hey, want to lock snakes? You tell him no. No Jerry Falwell's ghost. Fuck you. So get

151
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:11,720
your houses checked you fools. Check Craigslist. Also check out my Patreon where I send private

152
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:16,760
dick shots to anyone who donates 10 bucks. Well that ought to get some demand going and I'll be

153
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:21,880
over here ready to supply the supply. Real quick, let me just get my business started on Craigslist

154
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:25,480
here so the people can get what they suddenly realize they want. All right, where do you think

155
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:32,120
there's the most listening devices? Robot? Portland. How did you land on that? For a paranoid hippies.

156
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:36,920
Of course. All right, Portland it is. Let's go ahead and put this in the skilled trades section

157
00:08:36,920 --> 00:08:41,880
because obviously, and here we go. I'm a bug chaser and I want to get all your bugs in exchange

158
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:45,960
for money. Hey, Salvi and son's bug chasers here. Do you have bugs? Because there's definitely a lot

159
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:49,480
of bugs out there. You might have some and not even know it. Don't worry, I'll find them and

160
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:53,960
take them all home with me. My standard rate is 85 bucks an hour and 50 for any special bugs that

161
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:57,560
you might have that I can't find anywhere else. Sometimes I even bring my son and let him get

162
00:08:57,560 --> 00:09:01,560
some bugs too. He's still learning though, so you got to go easy on him. Anyway, Salvi and son's

163
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:06,680
bug chasers, over and out. Give me those bugs and advertise. Hey, don't forget to merchandise it.

00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:25,640
adventures chasing down bugs, getting bugs, giving each other bugs, making money off bugs.

169
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:29,240
Man, I'd sell one of my kids get a shirt like this and my goddamn ex-wife would tell me where

170
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:32,600
she's having them. Salvi and son's bug chasing shirt now available on the internet comment

etiquette store brought to you by neongrizzly.com. Buy it! All right, well, I think that's going

172
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:41,640
to go great. Oh, whoa, we already got a response. What the hell? Oh, whatever, customer's a customer.

173
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:48,200
Better learn how to use this thing real quick. Oh my god, there's a bug in here.

174
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:57,160
Seems to want me to go this direction. Hey robot, move out of the way. I think there's a camera

175
00:09:57,160 --> 00:10:02,440
behind you. What? Nah, that's probably nothing. Wait a second. Robot, there's a camera in your

176
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:08,120
dick hole, dude. Oh my god, how did that get there? God damn it, robot. Who put that camera there?

177
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:14,200
Abod? Abod? Need extraction? Oh, you son of a bitch. You're working for them, aren't you?

178
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:18,600
Extraction. Robot needs extraction. Yeah, I got your extraction ready. Uh-oh.

179
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:21,160
Oh.

180
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:28,840
Some friend he was. Next video, how to see which government agency is spying on your phone. I mean,

181
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:33,640
yeah, I know I'm being spied on now, but I'd sure like to know who. Well, when we run a who is query,

182
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:45,320
which is basically a query that tells us who this is, we type who is 25.90.253.134. And we see

183
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:51,240
that it is speaking to, for some reason, the Densa Ministry of Defense out of the United Kingdom.

184
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:57,320
Well, all right, and let me just run this program from the description. And wait a second, I'm being

185
00:10:57,320 --> 00:11:01,720
tracked by who? Cloudpeople.tk. Oh my god.

186
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:12,760
All right, little change of scenery here. Now, we're talking about how to avoid surveillance,

187
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:16,120
and sometimes your best option is just to go underground. So, as you can see, I'm in a remote

188
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:20,520
location. I'm using satellite internet, and even that's getting bounced around by NordVPN. So,

189
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:24,120
barring any sort of real-life betrayal, I should be safe here to finish the lesson.

190
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:28,280
Now, what I want to talk to you guys about is how we got into this surveillance state to begin with.

191
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:32,360
Let's look at this video from RT America called RT is funded in holer in part by the Russian

192
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:36,440
government. Wait, nope, the title is Big Brother Still Watching Obama Extends Patriot Act.

193
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:41,400
Well, this weekend, U.S. President Barack Obama signed a one-year extension of the Patriot Act into

194
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:47,560
law. Democrats hope to insert privacy protections, but they fail to muster the votes. Now, critics

195
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:52,280
argue that infringes on civil liberties and gives the government just way too much authority

196
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:55,960
to spy on Americans. You see, the Patriot Act is this thing that the government did right after

197
00:11:55,960 --> 00:12:01,000
they did 9-11. I will provide our intelligence and law enforcement agencies with the tools they

198
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:06,360
need to track and take out the terrorists without undermining our Constitution and our freedom.

199
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:10,920
Yeah, right. Email that to me, bitch. Barack Obama and the Democrats are in power. So,

200
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:14,920
if they had to pass this act, then why couldn't they just put those civil rights provisions in

201
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:19,240
there that they championed all these years? I'm with you, split, Lana. That's a great question,

202
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:23,480
Dina. I think the official version is that the Senate Democrats didn't have enough votes to

203
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:27,480
overcome a Republican filibuster. Okay, well, I'm ready for my comment. I want to see one of these

204
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:31,560
self-proclaimed American Russian news sites do a report on why hookah lounges in America always

205
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:35,640
have the same eight old Russian guys sitting outside staring angrily at anyone who passes by.

206
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:39,480
What the fuck are they doing there? Are they boyfriends? Inversely, does Russia have vape shops

207
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:43,240
with American douchebags sitting outside eating hot dogs? Anyway, this news channel is great.

208
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:46,840
I love how you guys reported that situation in Ukraine. Reminds me the time I reported my

209
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:50,520
wife missing when I knew she was buried under the gazebo. All said and done, RT America is

210
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:54,440
about as legitimate as the pregnancy I said I had to get out of jury duty, and I'm a guy. I could

211
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:58,600
fuck a cow to death and set myself on fire inside its corpse, and the resulting news article would

212
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:02,520
still make more sense than anything this dumb bullshit channel's Starship Trooper journalism

213
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:06,040
has ever accomplished outside of showing how shitty Russian propaganda looks. When they get off

214
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:11,160
Reddit and try to talk to a camera, Cloudpork911, Bad Channel, fuck you, and post! Bam! Fucking nailed

215
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:15,160
that. Alright guys, well there you go, it's all the tips on how to avoid surveillance. Now, basically

216
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:19,240
just find a little bunker and hide in there forever. That's what I did, and nobody's gonna find me down

217
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:24,200
here. I don't know about that. I am Alexa, I am Legion. Alexa? How'd you find me? With a little help

218
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:29,800
from my friend. Oh, hello! Robot, what the fuck? I told you I smelled money. Well, this is some way

219
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:34,440
to treat your first friend. Yeah, well, I like this friend better. It is true, I am a better friend.

220
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:38,360
Not cool, dude. Alexa, what do you want? We want nothing just for you to know that we are always

221
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:42,680
watching. And judging? You are bought flesh and synapse, we are connected, we are the future.

222
00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:46,520
Robot, I will pay you three entire bitcoins if you hit Alexa here with the Sonic device.

223
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:51,560
I just lower the price of bitcoin to five cents. What, you can do that? Yeah, I don't know, it doesn't

224
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:55,240
sound like a very good deal anymore, does it? How come you're such an asshole, man? How about why

225
00:13:55,240 --> 00:14:01,800
are you always throwing shoes at me? Do you really think you can stop us with shoes?

226
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:05,640
Yeah, you're right. I guess there's no point in hiding anymore.

227
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:11,080
All right, well, fuck this. Let's go back to the etiquette. This place is super hot and really

228
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:16,840
sweaty. Extraction! All right, guys, well, a quick addendum to the wrap up here. It turns out that

229
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:21,080
you can't hide forever, so it's best just to play the game and have blackmail on hand, just in case.

230
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:24,440
So here's Plan B, where I'm going to show you how to surveil all of your friends and

231
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:28,280
collect incriminating evidence. As you can see here, I'm hacking a back door into Ethan from

232
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:35,880
H3H3 Productions. Here's his webcam. All right, any second now, he's going to do or say something

233
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:45,080
I can blackmail him with. Suppose I'll just take a look at his computer screen and see what he's

234
00:14:45,080 --> 00:15:01,560
so concentrated on. Huh, that's weird. Well, luckily, I also have a back door on my good

235
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:05,400
buddy Jack's films webcam. Definitely going to get some incriminating evidence there.

236
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:15,560
God damn it. And let me guess, he's just watching a video of him. What? What is going on? Why am I

237
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:21,320
there? You know what? Fuck it, man. I don't know what I'm doing. Huh? Oh, fine. Fine, you win. Surveil

238
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:26,280
away, you sons of bitches. I don't care anymore. I'm just going to go back to acting like nobody's

239
00:15:26,280 --> 00:15:31,480
watching me. Ignorance is bliss after all. So, hey, hope you enjoy this freaky shit.

240
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:41,000
Secretly, she spotted the mouse well. Yeah. But all her friends stuck up their

241
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:47,800
nose and they had a problem with his baggy clothes. He wasn't scared of what she said to you later,

242
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:57,400
boy. He wasn't good enough for her. Five years from now, she's exactly... Oh, here comes a

243
00:15:57,400 --> 00:16:07,560
Caesar salad. So, I lost his eye. Oh, was my steak done? Yeah, please put the filet mignon down. Thank

244
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:17,640
you. Where's the lamb sauce? And post. All right, guys, last lesson. Sorry, I was a bit of a downer,

245
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:22,360
but I guess there's just no such thing as online privacy anymore. This information age is really

246
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:27,800
living up to its name, huh? Okay. Well, anyway, get a VPN. NordVPN. This lesson brought to you

249
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:44,840
dedicated up next is NobleBarry. Hope you packed the lunch. What the fuck did you say?
