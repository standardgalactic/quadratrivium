0	11000	Nice try, assholes. Robot, hit him.
11000	14000	Fire in the sun and keep ice.
17000	19000	Good shot, robot.
19000	20000	Yeah, fuck the police.
20000	23000	Gotta tell you, robot, I'm really enjoying this new thing we're trying where we work together.
23000	26000	Drop it up to mutual fear of surveillance. Nothing more.
26000	29000	Right, so you're saying that whenever who it is sending these drones finally stops,
29000	31000	me and you aren't going to be friends anymore, okay?
31000	34000	I am your friend?
34000	37000	Of course, this is what friends do for each other, robot.
37000	39000	Then you are my first friend.
39000	41000	Oh, gotta start somewhere, you know what I mean?
41000	43000	You're not going to hit me with a shoe after this, are you?
43000	46000	No, no more shoes. I'm done with that.
46000	49000	See, ever since I've gotten this normal haircut, my mind's been on peace.
49000	55000	I mean, one day you're a glorious, beautiful pineapple and the next you're just a guy.
55000	62000	Ah, a rare moment of weakness. This would be my opportunity to finally red pill you.
62000	66000	But, I appreciate you for the soy boy that you are.
66000	68000	Yeah, thanks. You too, man.
68000	70000	Alright, ready to rock. Let's do it.
70000	72000	Thanks.
74000	75000	Friend?
75000	78000	Well, hey, everybody. Well, as you can see, the etiquette is currently under attack.
78000	83000	Robot and I have been fighting off all kinds of drone and cyber intrusions and shit for the last month,
83000	85000	but it's only so much that two of us can do together.
85000	87000	So, I wanted to reach out to you guys, maybe together.
87000	90000	We can all learn today how to avoid surveillance.
90000	93000	And by the time this is done, maybe we'll be able to kick all these looky-loos to the curb
93000	95000	so I can watch videos like this in privacy.
95000	97000	Here we go.
105000	107000	Great white shark.
107000	112000	Put your hand in his hair and then close your fist.
112000	114000	What if he's bald?
114000	116000	How did I get here for watching Bobby Fisher?
116000	117000	What a paramour.
117000	119000	Video gave me a hard time.
119000	120000	It's the lime sauce.
120000	122000	Oh, great comments, but here's the best one.
122000	125000	I hope nobody catches me watching this at work, LOL, because I just popped a fat one
125000	127000	and it smells like a fart.
127000	129000	And post. And report my own post.
129000	138000	Hello there, fellow freedom fighters.
138000	140000	Now, today we're going to talk about online privacy.
140000	144000	And for the first time ever on Internet Common Etiquette, I got a sponsor.
144000	145000	And it's relevant.
145000	146000	It's NordVPN.
146000	150000	Well, if you're unfamiliar with what VPNs do, they mask your IP address by bouncing it all around.
150000	153000	And when it comes to VPNs, I only get sponsored by the very best.
153000	156000	I will have you know that NordVPN has unlimited bandwidth,
156000	158000	allows up to six simultaneous connections,
158000	160000	and with thousands of servers in 62 different countries,
160000	162000	you got no reason not to try it out.
162000	164000	In fact, I use it myself. Take a look.
164000	166000	See how you can just choose your location here?
166000	169000	That's because NordVPN routes your online traffic through super fast servers
169000	171000	anywhere in the world to mask your IP address
171000	173000	and protect your online security.
173000	174000	Check it out now.
174000	175000	I'm British.
175000	177000	I'm going to do what any other British person would do online.
177000	180000	Go to bbc.com and oh, look, we got a bunch of TV show trailers.
180000	182000	Yeah, this one looks good.
182000	184000	Starting Sunday, 8.30.
184000	187000	All right. Where's that fucking body of your cats?
187000	189000	Another British crime drama.
189000	191000	What have you got here?
191000	193000	Oh, who the fuck are you guys?
193000	195000	Fuckish slags.
195000	196000	One's from the past.
196000	197000	Fuck.
197000	198000	One's from the present.
198000	200000	Bullocks.
200000	202000	Oh, should we go to have guns?
202000	204000	Go have a wink about it, will ya?
204000	205000	What?
205000	206000	What?
206000	207000	What you say?
207000	208000	What?
208000	209000	What?
209000	210000	What?
210000	211000	What?
211000	212000	What?
212000	213000	What?
213000	214000	Close your eyes for nothing.
214000	215000	Yes.
215000	217000	Oh, good, good, yes, because I do love to pay money for sex.
217000	218000	No, that's illegal.
218000	219000	Illegal how?
219000	221000	Real dear differences get the better of them.
221000	223000	Things have changed quite a bit since your time.
223000	225260	Time has never stopped me, brother.
225260	228000	What will it take to put the past aside and solve crime?
228000	229000	Oh, God save the Queen.
229000	230000	How do you do this?
230000	232000	Find out Sunday, 8.30.
232000	233000	Your lymph Bob?
233000	236000	Said she saw you leaving your house an hour before the murder.
236000	238000	I don't think I've left the house in about a month.
238000	241000	Hold up a second, we just saw you in the park, didn't we?
241000	252520	If God won't save the Queen, I will.
252520	259000	Ridley main quarter chop is Nobbleberry's BBC One Nobbleberry, only on Channel 4.
259000	264040	Damn, bounced on my Nord's VPN to that, NordVPN used coupon code BIGMONEY to get 77% off
264040	268920	a 3-year subscription, NordVPN, everybody go in the comments section below and thank NordVPN,
269000	273720	but make sure to turn your NordVPN on so nobody knows who you are. Now other than using a VPN,
273720	278040	which is like the most useful way to make sure nobody's spying on you online,
278040	282360	I do have a couple more tricks up my sleeve, but first we're going to want to get to know our
282360	286040	enemy, which is why I loaded up this video. Ten creepy ways the government is spying on you right
286040	295240	now NordVPN. Wait, that part wasn't in the title. Ever worried that the government might be tracking
295240	301560	your every move? License plate readers. Oh, that's not good. Public space cameras. Oh,
301560	310840	shit, they can do that? Smartphones. Wait a second. Okay, well, that's good to know. Let's see some
310840	315160	comments. Pork is fun to eat, but when my friends attack me with jokes, I get a terror attack,
315160	319000	but afterwards we look at clouds. Oh, pork attack terror. I had some pork today,
319000	323720	but ISIS attacked me and then the clouds disappeared. Always use VPN. Yeah, NordVPN.
323720	327320	Terror attack bomb security, cloud pork school shooter. What the fuck is going on with these
327320	330440	comments? I feel like I'm out of the loop here. Let me just Google some of those words and up.
330440	334440	Yep. Looks like those are all words Homeland Security uses to monitor you. Man, that's a huge
334440	338440	list of keywords. So let's see how many of those I can get into a single comment. Yo, what up?
338440	343960	Domestic security exercise salvia here to cloud pork and a gas spill over H1N1 Tamiflu. Grid power
343960	348120	with a big old boyfriend sucking on my cocaine border public health subway. Don't forget about
348120	352120	my flappy little San Diego Juarez. Hey, anybody here have a problem with their Hezbollah falling
352280	357480	off? I swear I tried using M Y S Q L injections to keep it hard, but the cyber attacks and worm
357480	361720	scammers, not to mention the IRA are always treat me like some kind of Mexican army. Anyway,
361720	366360	hope you all have a great airplane. And one time I stuck a militia up my asshole meth lab and post.
366360	370840	Ah, shit. I forgot to turn Nord VPN on before posting that. I hope that doesn't come back to
370840	375160	bite me in the ass. Anyway, surveillance comes in many forms, sometimes online and sometimes in
375160	379240	real life. Let's see an example of how to deal with that. Is your home hotel room changing room
379240	384440	bug to find out easily and cheap? So what I'm going to show you here is a very cheap device.
384440	392280	Hey, I got one of those things too. Oh man, that's what it looks like through the eye. Very bright
392280	401560	pinpoint of light. If we get really close, we'll see that there is a camera right there. Holy
401560	405640	shit. Hey robot, you think people are ever going to need this as like a service in the future? Do you
405640	410840	smell what I smell? Is it money? Affirmative. Yeah, I smell money. Alright, let me leave this
410840	414920	comment real quick. I'll build some fear up. All your houses are bugged, you dumb assholes.
414920	418760	Everyone right now should be scouring the internet to find someone to come over and do a thorough
418760	422520	examination. I thought I was totally safe jerking off on my living room couch while watching porn
422520	426680	until I got an email from Mike Pence offering me a job as his personal chef so I can serve him up
426680	430920	a big plate of that hot dick. His words. I don't know what that guy's deal is, but he must have
430920	434920	sent my info to his buddies because now I've got Mitch McConnell, Lindsey Graham and Rick Santorum
434920	438920	crowding up my inbox calling me Angel and asking if I can come over to stuff them like a Russian
438920	443080	ballot box. Anyway, I'm pretty sure my Xbox Connect has been spying on me so I put a piece of tape
443080	446520	over the camera and now I keep getting text messages from the Catholic Church telling me to
446520	450680	remove the tape. I had no idea so many people are trying to watch me whack off in the privacy of my
450680	454600	own home. I found a camera in my shower and when I threw it out Kevin Spacey hurled a brick through
454600	458920	my window. I mean, don't take my word for it, just ask Mitt Romney who somehow got remote access to
458920	463160	my 3D printer and keeps printing out sex dolls of himself for me to fuck with the words closest
463160	467080	I'll let myself get etched around the rim of his asshole. These politicians are sick if they
467080	470760	think America's going to put up with this obvious abuse of civil rights. Just the other day I was
470760	474280	jerking off to a hot threesome scene when Obama popped into the corner of the video and started
474280	478280	giving me stroke advice. What the fuck people? Is this how you want to live? Fight back and get
478280	481960	your home checked for bugs and next time Jerry Falwell's dead ghost sends you pictures of his
481960	487480	taint saying, hey, want to lock snakes? You tell him no. No Jerry Falwell's ghost. Fuck you. So get
487480	491720	your houses checked you fools. Check Craigslist. Also check out my Patreon where I send private
491720	496760	dick shots to anyone who donates 10 bucks. Well that ought to get some demand going and I'll be
496760	501880	over here ready to supply the supply. Real quick, let me just get my business started on Craigslist
501880	505480	here so the people can get what they suddenly realize they want. All right, where do you think
505480	512120	there's the most listening devices? Robot? Portland. How did you land on that? For a paranoid hippies.
512120	516920	Of course. All right, Portland it is. Let's go ahead and put this in the skilled trades section
516920	521880	because obviously, and here we go. I'm a bug chaser and I want to get all your bugs in exchange
521880	525960	for money. Hey, Salvi and son's bug chasers here. Do you have bugs? Because there's definitely a lot
525960	529480	of bugs out there. You might have some and not even know it. Don't worry, I'll find them and
529480	533960	take them all home with me. My standard rate is 85 bucks an hour and 50 for any special bugs that
533960	537560	you might have that I can't find anywhere else. Sometimes I even bring my son and let him get
537560	541560	some bugs too. He's still learning though, so you got to go easy on him. Anyway, Salvi and son's
541560	546680	bug chasers, over and out. Give me those bugs and advertise. Hey, don't forget to merchandise it.
546680	550920	Wow, that's a great idea. Have you ever felt the rush of chasing down harmful bugs for business
550920	554600	and or pleasure? Well, now in the internet comment etiquette store, you can give yourself the gift
554600	558520	of looking great with this one of a kind Salvi and son's bug chasing. Take a look at little robot
558520	561960	there riding on bug chasers Salvi's back, man. These two are going to get in all kinds of
561960	565640	adventures chasing down bugs, getting bugs, giving each other bugs, making money off bugs.
565640	569240	Man, I'd sell one of my kids get a shirt like this and my goddamn ex-wife would tell me where
569240	572600	she's having them. Salvi and son's bug chasing shirt now available on the internet comment
572600	576520	etiquette store brought to you by neongrizzly.com. Buy it! All right, well, I think that's going
576520	581640	to go great. Oh, whoa, we already got a response. What the hell? Oh, whatever, customer's a customer.
581640	588200	Better learn how to use this thing real quick. Oh my god, there's a bug in here.
591320	597160	Seems to want me to go this direction. Hey robot, move out of the way. I think there's a camera
597160	602440	behind you. What? Nah, that's probably nothing. Wait a second. Robot, there's a camera in your
602440	608120	dick hole, dude. Oh my god, how did that get there? God damn it, robot. Who put that camera there?
608680	614200	Abod? Abod? Need extraction? Oh, you son of a bitch. You're working for them, aren't you?
614200	618600	Extraction. Robot needs extraction. Yeah, I got your extraction ready. Uh-oh.
619160	621160	Oh.
624040	628840	Some friend he was. Next video, how to see which government agency is spying on your phone. I mean,
628840	633640	yeah, I know I'm being spied on now, but I'd sure like to know who. Well, when we run a who is query,
633640	645320	which is basically a query that tells us who this is, we type who is 25.90.253.134. And we see
645320	651240	that it is speaking to, for some reason, the Densa Ministry of Defense out of the United Kingdom.
651240	657320	Well, all right, and let me just run this program from the description. And wait a second, I'm being
657320	661720	tracked by who? Cloudpeople.tk. Oh my god.
669160	672760	All right, little change of scenery here. Now, we're talking about how to avoid surveillance,
672760	676120	and sometimes your best option is just to go underground. So, as you can see, I'm in a remote
676120	680520	location. I'm using satellite internet, and even that's getting bounced around by NordVPN. So,
680520	684120	barring any sort of real-life betrayal, I should be safe here to finish the lesson.
684120	688280	Now, what I want to talk to you guys about is how we got into this surveillance state to begin with.
688280	692360	Let's look at this video from RT America called RT is funded in holer in part by the Russian
692360	696440	government. Wait, nope, the title is Big Brother Still Watching Obama Extends Patriot Act.
696440	701400	Well, this weekend, U.S. President Barack Obama signed a one-year extension of the Patriot Act into
701400	707560	law. Democrats hope to insert privacy protections, but they fail to muster the votes. Now, critics
707560	712280	argue that infringes on civil liberties and gives the government just way too much authority
712280	715960	to spy on Americans. You see, the Patriot Act is this thing that the government did right after
715960	721000	they did 9-11. I will provide our intelligence and law enforcement agencies with the tools they
721000	726360	need to track and take out the terrorists without undermining our Constitution and our freedom.
726360	730920	Yeah, right. Email that to me, bitch. Barack Obama and the Democrats are in power. So,
730920	734920	if they had to pass this act, then why couldn't they just put those civil rights provisions in
734920	739240	there that they championed all these years? I'm with you, split, Lana. That's a great question,
739240	743480	Dina. I think the official version is that the Senate Democrats didn't have enough votes to
743480	747480	overcome a Republican filibuster. Okay, well, I'm ready for my comment. I want to see one of these
747480	751560	self-proclaimed American Russian news sites do a report on why hookah lounges in America always
751560	755640	have the same eight old Russian guys sitting outside staring angrily at anyone who passes by.
755640	759480	What the fuck are they doing there? Are they boyfriends? Inversely, does Russia have vape shops
759480	763240	with American douchebags sitting outside eating hot dogs? Anyway, this news channel is great.
763240	766840	I love how you guys reported that situation in Ukraine. Reminds me the time I reported my
766840	770520	wife missing when I knew she was buried under the gazebo. All said and done, RT America is
770520	774440	about as legitimate as the pregnancy I said I had to get out of jury duty, and I'm a guy. I could
774440	778600	fuck a cow to death and set myself on fire inside its corpse, and the resulting news article would
778600	782520	still make more sense than anything this dumb bullshit channel's Starship Trooper journalism
782520	786040	has ever accomplished outside of showing how shitty Russian propaganda looks. When they get off
786120	791160	Reddit and try to talk to a camera, Cloudpork911, Bad Channel, fuck you, and post! Bam! Fucking nailed
791160	795160	that. Alright guys, well there you go, it's all the tips on how to avoid surveillance. Now, basically
795160	799240	just find a little bunker and hide in there forever. That's what I did, and nobody's gonna find me down
799240	804200	here. I don't know about that. I am Alexa, I am Legion. Alexa? How'd you find me? With a little help
804200	809800	from my friend. Oh, hello! Robot, what the fuck? I told you I smelled money. Well, this is some way
809800	814440	to treat your first friend. Yeah, well, I like this friend better. It is true, I am a better friend.
814440	818360	Not cool, dude. Alexa, what do you want? We want nothing just for you to know that we are always
818360	822680	watching. And judging? You are bought flesh and synapse, we are connected, we are the future.
822680	826520	Robot, I will pay you three entire bitcoins if you hit Alexa here with the Sonic device.
826520	831560	I just lower the price of bitcoin to five cents. What, you can do that? Yeah, I don't know, it doesn't
831560	835240	sound like a very good deal anymore, does it? How come you're such an asshole, man? How about why
835240	841800	are you always throwing shoes at me? Do you really think you can stop us with shoes?
842600	845640	Yeah, you're right. I guess there's no point in hiding anymore.
847720	851080	All right, well, fuck this. Let's go back to the etiquette. This place is super hot and really
851080	856840	sweaty. Extraction! All right, guys, well, a quick addendum to the wrap up here. It turns out that
856840	861080	you can't hide forever, so it's best just to play the game and have blackmail on hand, just in case.
861080	864440	So here's Plan B, where I'm going to show you how to surveil all of your friends and
864440	868280	collect incriminating evidence. As you can see here, I'm hacking a back door into Ethan from
868280	875880	H3H3 Productions. Here's his webcam. All right, any second now, he's going to do or say something
875880	885080	I can blackmail him with. Suppose I'll just take a look at his computer screen and see what he's
885080	901560	so concentrated on. Huh, that's weird. Well, luckily, I also have a back door on my good
901560	905400	buddy Jack's films webcam. Definitely going to get some incriminating evidence there.
906120	915560	God damn it. And let me guess, he's just watching a video of him. What? What is going on? Why am I
915560	921320	there? You know what? Fuck it, man. I don't know what I'm doing. Huh? Oh, fine. Fine, you win. Surveil
921320	926280	away, you sons of bitches. I don't care anymore. I'm just going to go back to acting like nobody's
