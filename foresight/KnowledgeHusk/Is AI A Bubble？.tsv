0	5440	This video is sponsored by Ground News, more from them in a bit.
5440	10560	Miriam Webster defines AI as a three-toed sloth.
10560	16700	According to Al Perkins, a sloth is a slow-moving arboreal mammal, and the name AI was given
16700	20280	to this creature because of its high-pitched screech.
20280	21280	Fascinating.
21280	26040	Artificial intelligence, on the other hand, is the ability for computer systems and algorithms
26040	29680	to imitate intelligent human behavior.
29680	31920	This is not anything new.
31920	36080	The technology dates back to nearly the beginning of computers.
36080	41800	But obviously, the AI that is gaining all the hype today isn't quite the same as the
41800	47600	enemies in your video games or the countless chatbots that have been around for decades.
47600	52360	Clearly, chatGPT is not the same as Clippy.
52360	53760	Probably?
53760	56280	This whole AI thing is complicated.
56280	60320	We don't know the ultimate potential of large language models and neural networks
60320	65880	and blah, blah, blah, but at the same time, it doesn't take a genius to figure out that
65880	72040	the letters A and I are being used as much as possible by corporations looking to increase
72040	73720	their share values.
73720	80560	If a company so much as utters AI, investors cannot help but invest.
80560	85520	Even if they have no idea what it means, or what it does, or what it might do, they just
85520	88640	assume it's going to make money.
88640	93800	NVIDIA, which was well known for being the producer of GPUs for gaming PCs and other
93800	100320	computing products, has gone from a successful company to, well, the third largest on the
100320	101320	planet.
101320	108960	It has seen an increase in value that is nothing short of obscene, all thanks to this AI.
108960	114120	Microsoft is now the most valuable corporation on the planet, as the company is all aboard
114240	119920	the AI hype train, pushing it into every corner of their operating system and having
119920	124520	an extremely close relationship with open AI.
124520	129920	All the while, nobody can seem to agree on whether this technology will change the very
129920	135040	fabric of our society, or prove to be another flash in the pan.
135040	140440	Tech fad, everyone, everyone has an opinion.
140440	146360	I'm exhausted of seeing this back and forth argument that never seems to reach any conclusion.
146360	151160	And speaking of, Ground News is a website and app that gathers related articles from
151160	156760	more than 50,000 sources around the world in one place so you can compare how different
156760	159240	outlets cover the same story.
159240	164120	Each story comes with a clear breakdown of the political bias, ownership, and headlines
164120	170080	of the sources reporting, all backed by ratings from three independent news monitoring organizations.
170080	174080	Take a look at the story about how open AI is setting up a safety and security committee
174080	178320	as it starts training for the next frontier model, something that has caused a lot of
178320	182640	controversies as previous safety team leaders have recently left the company.
182640	189320	This story has been covered by more than 73 sources, with 37% of them leaning left, while
189320	190960	14% leans right.
190960	196000	You can also see the ownership information, and for this story, 40% of the reporting outlets
196000	198320	are owned by media conglomerates.
198320	202060	You can even compare headlines to see how this bias can affect framing.
202060	206320	We can compare headlines quickly and see how some organizations will stoke the public's
206320	211440	existing fears about AI to get clicks, while others might capitalize on the distrust that
211440	214960	Sam Altman has garnered over the past few months.
214960	218720	Ground News has this feature called Blind Spot, which instantly shows you stories that the
218720	223720	left-leaning or right-leaning news media conveniently won't report on.

233960	237600	use to get unlimited access to all of their features.
237600	243400	I think Ground News is an exceptionally important website, and one you absolutely need to check
243400	244400	out.
244400	245800	Now, back to the video.
245800	250840	Yes, AI has been around for a while, dating back to the earliest computers, but the hype
250840	254640	right now surrounds progress on large language models.
254640	259920	These are programs that take a lot of information in, require a user prompt, and through complex
259920	264680	algorithms basically create probabilities of what the output should be.
264680	269040	As lifelike as they might seem, these things are not actually alive.
269040	271160	There's no thinking involved.
271160	274080	They cannot create wholly original or novel ideas.
274080	277320	They require training data to do anything.
277400	282360	I've seen it suggested that one of the best ways to prove this is to ask a question with
282360	287120	an answer that the AI model has not been provided with in its training data.
287120	293120	For example, go to chatGPT and ask, what's the 21st letter in this sentence?
293120	298840	You might get a different response, but I got the AI saying confidently, it's E. And
298840	303840	if you say, I don't think that's right, it will try and count again and give you a
303840	305000	different letter.
305000	306920	This time, I.
306920	312040	It will sometimes interpret two and one as letters, maybe the apostrophe.
312040	318480	And the reason questions like this break the AI is because it doesn't actually understand
318480	320680	what a letter is.
320680	326400	It doesn't understand anything, but it searches the internet and its training data for the
326400	328760	most likely answer.
328760	334680	Even with these limitations, the technology is clearly capable of some impressive things.
334680	340280	Some assisting you in writing computer programs to proofreading your short stories, to helping
340280	342040	you cheat on your homework.
342040	348520	But even still, a lot of what gets promoted as AI isn't really AI.
348520	354120	A lot of the revolutionary abilities that AI has been reported to have is actually stuff
354120	358840	that traditional software has been capable of doing for a long time.
358840	364360	This creates a problem where the idea of this technology, it's often more valuable than
364360	366960	what it can actually do.
366960	372400	Because again, just saying AI makes stock number go up.
372400	377280	So a while back, Amazon launched a real-life store, a brick-and-mortar shop where customers
377280	382600	could walk in, grab items off the shelf, put them in their carts, and leave without ever
382600	384280	checking out.
384280	388360	These items were automatically charged to people's accounts without any need to speak
388360	392000	to a cashier or even use a self-serve system.
392000	395040	It was all done automatically.
395040	399440	Many assume this was handled using an array of computers and sensors and scanners, but
399440	405000	in reality, the company just probably hired a lot of Indian employees to watch people
405000	407800	while they shopped on cameras.
407800	412200	And then they would charge the user's Amazon account.
412200	417280	Google was caught off guard by the immediate success of ChatGPT and has been trying its
417280	420760	hardest to launch its own AI competitor.
420760	426120	They paid millions of dollars to Reddit for access to the website's posts to train their
426120	430920	AI with and it went about as well as you'd expect.
430920	435840	When users asked questions like how to make your cheese stick on pizza, Google decided
435840	439680	the best answer was to use non-toxic glue.
439680	446160	This information, by the way, was provided by an 11-year-old Reddit post by user Fucksmith,
446160	451520	which Google's model decided was the most reliable source for information.
451520	456920	When asked about how many rocks you should eat a day, it did not give the correct answer
456920	458840	of zero.
458840	461800	And look, things just kept getting worse from here.
461800	467480	As you can imagine, any technology that uses the internet to train itself is probably going
467480	469080	to make a few mistakes.
469080	475240	And those mistakes have made AI a very easy and fun punching bag right now.
475320	478520	But yeah, not all AIs are created equally.
478520	484320	You can't say that LLMs or machine learning or neural networks are completely useless
484320	488400	because, well, a lot of people are using it.
488400	490080	There's potential here.
490080	495880	Natural language programming could allow people to write their own programs with no code required,
495880	502120	just describing what kind of application they want to make and the AI would handle the rest.
502120	507960	You could use this to learn to research information, but again, AI can be wrong.
507960	511160	So I view it in the same way that I view Wikipedia.
511160	516560	It's useful, it's a nice jumping off point, but you need to check your sources.
516560	521600	It's not 100% accurate, or compiling lots of data really quickly to get back at your
521600	523920	homeowner's association.
523920	525640	This does have real value.
525640	530680	Automatic translations, transcriptions, stuff that may have been possible with previous
530720	533920	software is just more accessible than ever.
533920	536480	But people are taking this too far.
536480	542560	The end goal of open AI is to achieve artificial general intelligence.
542560	550040	AGI is supposed to refer to a strong AI that can learn skills in tasks that it was never
550040	551440	trained to learn.
551440	557800	This could lead to machine sentience, consciousness, the singularity.
557880	562360	And right now, everyone seems to believe that if you just keep throwing more computing
562360	571200	power, more energy, more information into these algorithms, you can simply manifest AGI from
571200	574520	the kinds of artificial intelligence we have today.
574520	579440	Everybody has a different way of defining AGI because, well, nobody really knows what
579440	580960	it's supposed to look like.
580960	586440	We often divide AI into two categories, weak AI and strong AI.
586480	592120	Weak AI is capable of doing very specific tasks, stuff it was programmed to do, and
592120	596720	everything we've ever made so far has been a weak AI.
596720	602120	AGI would be a strong AI, and it could do a lot of jobs.
602120	605200	It could do a lot of stuff, would put you out of a job.
605200	608200	But what might this look like exactly?
608200	614960	There are a few different tests for AGI, but I've always found that the best would be
614960	618920	something done with an actual robot in a Tamaton.
618920	623520	Take a robot and ask it to repair the plumbing electrical systems and appliances of an early
623520	630000	20th century home, especially if none of that information is available through documentation
630000	631000	on the internet.
631000	634520	Every home is going to be slightly different, so the robot will need to make assumptions
634520	640760	to learn to understand why your custom 1950s toaster is not working and then try and figure
640760	646440	out, possibly through trial and error, how to get it back into toast making condition.
646440	651720	While today there are demos of robots completing simple tasks in the home, these are in controlled
651720	658080	environments and are only possible because of training data created from previous experiences.
658080	664200	This AGI robot would need to be capable of learning from unique situations, to ask questions
664200	668200	based on its own volition, and solve them by itself.
668200	671680	But there is no proof that this will happen.
671680	676560	In fact, studies do seem to suggest that there are diminishing returns when it comes to this
676560	677720	kind of stuff.
677720	683800	We don't know if any of this is even possible with traditional silicon chips and programming,
683800	686160	binary code, any of that.
686160	690200	It could take entirely new forms of computing to achieve this.
690200	694680	We don't fully understand how the human brain works, so attempting to replicate it
694680	700520	with far more simplistic technology, far more rigid technology, it just seems more than
700520	702400	a bit optimistic.
702400	707240	People are acting like we're five years away from robots taking every job, becoming alive,
707240	711240	enslaving humanity, changing life forever.
711240	715560	And honestly, chatGPT could be a stepping stone to all of this.
715560	717760	A stepping stone to AGI.
717760	724440	In the same way that the discovery of gunpowder was a stepping stone to the nuke.
724440	729800	Or the hot air balloon was a stepping stone to intergalactic spaceflight.
729800	732520	That is to say, not much of a step at all.
732520	737240	For all we know, LLMs and AGI might not even be related.
737240	739640	We might not even be on the right track.
739640	742000	We just don't know.
742000	749720	So if we don't even know if this can manifest into some more powerful AI, if we have no substantial
749720	755360	evidence to support that we're on the road to AGI, then why all the hype?
755360	759920	Obviously, it is incorporation's best interest for people to believe that this technology
759920	766520	is on the cusp of being something truly revolutionary, so good it's frightening.
766520	770440	It makes it seem way more advanced than it actually is.
770440	775280	It implies more potential for growth, which will make the stock number go up.
775280	778560	And they have ways to market this technology.
778560	784240	So many companies are just throwing around the words AI, even if it doesn't even apply
784240	786720	to their products in any way.
786720	792760	Gigabyte, which usually makes gaming-centric motherboards and memory thingies and whatnot.
792760	797720	Well they decided they wanted to go all in on the AI thing and have rebranded their products
797720	801160	with a big ole AI plastered on the side of them.
801160	805680	Yeah, rebranded, because it's really just kind of the same stuff you could find anywhere
805680	806680	else.
807120	810600	It's got AI written on it, whatever that means.
810600	815360	This exact same thing happened a few years back with the whole metaverse craze, where
815360	820280	every company started proclaiming that their existing video games and online services were
820280	825960	already in fact metaverses because investors wanted to hear that.
825960	830120	And it diluted the term to such a point that the word metaverse started to mean nothing
830120	833640	more than just a synonym for software.
833640	839680	When an AI makes a mistake, the companies call it a hallucination, which is a very misleading
839680	840680	term.
840680	846280	This is applying a human quality to the machine, when in reality it's not hallucinating.
846280	851360	It's just taking a set of probabilities and it hasn't received enough training data on
851360	855800	the topic or the right algorithms to give you an accurate answer.
855800	857360	It is not hallucinating.
857360	859200	It simply made a mistake.
859200	862480	The technology simply wasn't good enough.
862480	863800	Will it improve?
863800	870080	Yes, but we don't know how good it will get or how accurate it will become.
870080	877960	For AI sentience, it could be 5 years away or 10 or 100 or 1000 or it might not be possible
877960	880400	for us to build this at all.
880400	884840	We don't know and everything else until it happens is just a guess.
884840	890440	A lot of the AI safety you hear about actually does refer to more realistic concerns about
890440	892720	how this technology might be used.
892720	898600	If in the future, AI services become a replacement for traditional search engines like Google,
898600	903840	if people rely on ChatGPT to get all their news, then those in charge of the service
903840	910240	can lie, manipulate or alter information to benefit those who are in charge of the AI
910240	913920	to push their own motives, their own agendas.
913920	919640	This is where the concerns of safety often lie, not in the fantasy of robots taking over
919640	920640	the world.
920640	924080	Or at least that's where the fears should lie.
924080	929600	And look, if fancy quantum computing or something entirely unprecedented allows for a robot
929600	936840	revolution, allows for AGI, if today's technology and LLMs are on the right path to all of
936840	942560	this, and all we need is just a few trillion dollars in the combined power consumption
942560	946800	of a small nation, I'll be the first to admit I was wrong.
946800	953080	Oopsie daisy, egg on my face, but right now I'm just a little bit skeptical.
953080	958720	So for the purposes of this video, let's assume that the future of AI is not revolutionary,
958720	960360	but evolutionary.
960360	964120	And if that's the case, is it a bubble?
964120	968840	Yes, yes it is, but that doesn't mean it's worthless.
968840	973320	I kind of see AI right now like the dot com boom of the late 90s.
973320	977240	This was a time where investors believed that every single website was going to make millions
977240	978240	of dollars.
978240	982800	And once they figured out that only certain websites would ever become popular, would
982800	986800	ever become profitable, many of them took their money and ran.
986800	990560	The resulting fallout led to the dot com bubble burst.
990560	995300	But this wasn't the end of the worldwide web.
995300	1001240	Now I'm not saying that AI will be as important as the internet, but clearly this is more
1001240	1004560	than just a simple fad that's going to fade away.
1004560	1009400	I do think the bubble will burst, and then the industry will have to realistically look
1009400	1014920	at its value rather than rely on unfounded promises and rampant speculation.
1014920	1020720	But yeah, AI is here to stay, because it's been here for a long time.
1020720	1024320	AI already has changed our world.
1024320	1028840	Algorithms drive search engines, YouTube channel recommendations, most of the internet
1028840	1031160	is driven off of this automation.
1031160	1036680	We know that the technology has value because it's been around for a while.
1036680	1043460	The question is whether this new form of AI, LLMs, will have a significant impact on how
1043460	1048200	we live and work, or how significant of an impact that might be.
1048200	1051920	And a lot of people seem to have some doubts about all of this.
1051920	1056480	Rooters Institute for the Study of Journalism pulled 12,000 people from six different countries
1056480	1059120	online about their opinions on AI.
1059240	1064840	Granted, 12,000 people is not that many, doing polls online does not mean perfect results,
1064840	1067880	but this is about as good as we're going to get if we're trying to figure out what
1067880	1072080	the average person thinks about this technology.
1072080	1077480	And most people have no idea what it is, or what it does, or what it could do.
1077480	1083440	A lot of people have heard of AI in these new services, but they don't know what distinguishes
1083440	1087800	a large language model from traditional computer software.
1087800	1093520	You can tell that most people are not using AI that often, even if chat GPT has a huge
1093520	1095160	install base.
1095160	1098840	Younger people are more likely to try it out than older people, obviously.
1098840	1103600	But most people view AI as a technology that will primarily be used in professional settings
1103600	1109880	by scientists in social media companies, but less so by the average person and their daily
1109880	1110880	lives.
1110880	1115960	Again, if these people don't actually know what AI is, considering some of these poor
1116120	1122520	results, none of this is super helpful, but there is some stuff we can take away from
1122520	1123520	this.
1123520	1128160	It seems like people aren't just confused by the technology, they seem to fundamentally
1128160	1129240	dislike it.
1129240	1132000	There are a lot of concerns about the damage it can do.
1132000	1136600	People are scared it will take their jobs away, or just functions as tools to manipulate
1136600	1137600	the public.
1137600	1142920	And most don't seem interested in the positive aspects of this technology at all.
1142920	1145920	Most can't even identify what that might be.
1145920	1151600	Because a technology does need to be more than good enough, it needs to be perfect.
1151600	1155960	When driving a school bus or doing taxes for a multi-trillion dollar corporation, you
1155960	1162440	probably don't want to put this responsibility on a robot that can, or probably will, make
1162440	1163440	a mistake.
1163440	1165440	Yes, humans are not perfect.
1165440	1171440	The AI might even be better than the human in many cases, but humans give people somebody
1171440	1174240	to blame when things go wrong.
1174240	1180880	They provide accountability, something that the AI just doesn't have for AI.
1180880	1186840	Google spent all of Google I.O. 2024 talking about its AI initiatives, and people didn't
1186840	1188480	really seem to care all that much.
1188480	1193200	A lot of people just rolled their eyes because it's more AI slop.
1193200	1198960	Microsoft hyped up its new line of AI PCs, which most saw as a concerning invasion of
1198960	1203320	privacy rather than anything remotely worthwhile.
1203320	1208520	The corporation is betting the future of its operating system, of the Windows operating
1208520	1213840	system on AI, and it's a bet that doesn't seem to be panning out.
1213840	1219160	In fact, I've seen a lot more people talk about moving to Linux now that Windows is
1219160	1222560	infected with this AI garbage.
1222560	1228720	I have no doubt going forward that LLMs and machine learning and AI will manifest into
1228720	1230720	something valuable.
1230720	1236400	It's possible this might even result in massive changes to everyday life, but right now this
1236400	1242800	entire thing has been polluted by bad actors, false promises, and in my opinion, pretty
1242800	1248080	misleading marketing tactics, and it's baffling to me that people have just forgotten the
1248080	1255000	whole metaverse craze from a few years back, where the word itself began to mean nothing
1255000	1256160	by the end.
1256160	1260960	These analysts, who don't even understand the basic technology, are hyping up others
1260960	1266840	about how much money we're all apparently about to make, claiming that Nvidia is going
1266840	1273320	to be worth $10 trillion in just a few years, and as far as I can tell, there's just no
1273320	1276280	reasonable basis for these claims.
1276280	1281080	We've reached a point where Big Tech is so desperate to achieve growth that it just
1281080	1286240	keeps taking these fairly predictable and standard advancements and software and then
1286240	1293080	applying new buzzwords to the technology, and by the time the bubble should burst, they're
1293080	1296080	already onto marketing their next buzzword.
1296080	1301080	I don't want to dismiss the entire potential of AI by calling it the next metaverse, but
1301080	1303800	look, there's a lot of problems here.
1303800	1308680	And as of right now, for many people, this technology just kind of comes off as a slightly
1308680	1315360	more invasive, less accurate version of all these digital personal assistants that have
1315360	1318060	already become commonplace over the years.
1318060	1322520	This whole industry right now just seems so flimsy to me.
1322520	1325760	There's a good chance that everything I say here will age like milk.
1325760	1327080	I get that.
1327080	1332160	Maybe we will see a world where most jobs become significantly easier with the assistance
1332160	1337320	of the machines, where this is a necessity, or maybe the tech is too good and we all lose
1337320	1338320	our jobs.
1338480	1344120	I think right now we're seeing a technology that is more style over substance.
1344120	1348720	There is substance there, but there's just a lot of fluff here.
1348720	1352440	Or maybe I'm completely wrong, and in five years we'll all have Rosie the Robot in our
1352440	1353440	homes.
1353440	1355840	I need to get my robot out of my swimming pool.
1355840	1357800	I don't think she can breathe.
