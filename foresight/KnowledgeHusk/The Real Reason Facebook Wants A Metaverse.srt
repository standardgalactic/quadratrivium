1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,380
So a few years ago me and a friend were attending a college. It was the end of the

2
00:00:05,380 --> 00:00:10,620
semester and we had a big final project. Create a business pitch and show it to

3
00:00:10,620 --> 00:00:14,900
some investors. Now this was an early computer engineering course and I was a

4
00:00:14,900 --> 00:00:19,060
terrible student. My friend said hey do whatever you want so I waited a few weeks

5
00:00:19,060 --> 00:00:24,180
until the the final day and I was gonna start the project. I came up with my

6
00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:29,140
dream idea. It was called VR funzo or something stupid like that. Keep in mind

7
00:00:29,140 --> 00:00:34,140
VR was barely relevant at this time but it sounded cool to investors right? It was

8
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:40,380
a large grandiose spanning an innovative social network where users could live a

9
00:00:40,380 --> 00:00:47,380
second life. You get it? I think you played ping-pong to mine cryptocurrency or

10
00:00:47,380 --> 00:00:53,060
you could just get money by watching an ad. You could use this money these fun

11
00:00:53,060 --> 00:00:59,060
bucks to buy cars, buy things for your house, just buy things. You could hang

12
00:00:59,060 --> 00:01:03,780
out with other people and show them your cool things and out of the 20-page

13
00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:08,500
paper 15 pages were just bullet points that described the various cats that

14
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:12,620
you could buy in the game. Beneath that was the various hats that you could buy

15
00:01:12,620 --> 00:01:17,820
for those various cats. It wasn't the most original idea. This is permeated

16
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:22,660
fiction for a good while but you know I always liked that idea. Maybe not the

17
00:01:22,660 --> 00:01:26,920
mining for crypto part but having a place where you can you can just hang

18
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:33,340
out with people and VR and have your various hats in your various cats.

19
00:01:36,260 --> 00:01:49,540
Alright perfect. Oh hi Mark. Oh oh oh no. The word meta is obviously in reference

20
00:01:49,540 --> 00:01:53,900
to the metaverse. That's what Facebook's doing here. And in many ways this has

21
00:01:53,900 --> 00:02:00,300
become the new buzzword for tech companies and journalists, investors. Pretty soon

22
00:02:00,300 --> 00:02:04,260
we're gonna have the Fortnite metaverse and Microsoft announced its own

23
00:02:04,260 --> 00:02:10,660
metaverse for business. And Facebook is this. It's all very corporate. It's all

24
00:02:10,660 --> 00:02:16,600
very cringy. But is there something there? No but but I'll get to that. What

25
00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:20,800
exactly is the metaverse? That's something that a lot of people seem to

26
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:25,480
misunderstand. We've called it a digital living world where you can socialize,

27
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:30,720
make money, hang out, do anything you want. But there's a key factor that people

28
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:37,240
seem to forget. Well a lot of factors. One, it has to be in VR. So no, regardless of

29
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:41,520
what you've seen on Twitter, Second Life and MMOs and all this stuff is not a

30
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:47,360
metaverse. The internet itself is not a metaverse because it has to be in VR.

31
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:52,880
Secondly, it's got to be open source. Nobody can be in control of it, not owned

32
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:58,560
by a singular entity. In this way it is like the internet. But finally, and most

33
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:04,080
importantly, it's not real. It's literally a work of fiction. The metaverse is a

34
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:10,320
place in the world of Neil Stevenson's 1992 novel Snow Crash. That's it. That's

35
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:15,560
where this word came from. It's a book. I won't go too in-depth in the story here

36
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:20,040
because there'll be a whole video on that at some point. But in short, the

37
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:24,760
metaverse is an entirely open VR platform and in this place people are

38
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:28,880
represented by avatars. They can communicate with others, go to various

39
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:34,440
locations, buy a house, earn a living, whatever. It's the direct inspiration for

40
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:39,360
every VR world story you have ever heard. In the story, the metaverse is so

41
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:44,680
important because the outside world is awful. It's a chaotic dystopian

42
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:49,400
landscape where various corporations control limited city-states across the

43
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:54,000
nation. Hyperinflation makes a billion dollars useless. You're going to need

44
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:58,840
trillions to buy a lightbulb. The core concept of the metaverse is intended to

45
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:04,360
be escapism. Your status in society is more so defined whether you know how to

46
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:09,560
write code, make programs, create models, or contribute to the larger metaverse.

47
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:14,200
It's entirely open in nature and hobbyists can contribute whatever they

48
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:19,280
want to make the metaverse a better place. The story is meant as part speculative

49
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:24,800
futurism, social commentary, and a parody of many of the cyberpunk tropes. Our

50
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:29,680
main character is a pizza driver for the mob who happens to be a hacker. His

51
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:35,520
name is literally hero protagonist. But the humor right now is that the top

52
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:41,720
corporations in our world are interested in creating their own metaverses. As

53
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:46,800
TechRadar points out, this concept is literally the antagonist's plan in

54
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:51,720
Ready Player One. The only difference here is that there never is a free

55
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:56,960
metaverse. It starts broken. Now I'm not going to lie, I love the idea of the

56
00:04:56,960 --> 00:05:02,880
metaverse of a VR world. Disruptive Tech is disruptive for a reason. It will never

57
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:07,880
be obvious when it's coming. And most people won't think it's a good idea.

58
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:12,800
I've talked about on this channel how in the 90s the internet was deemed a fad.

59
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:17,360
The rhetoric surrounding the smartphone was that people were too addicted to

60
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:22,720
technology. The television was seen as a cesspool of culture, something that would

61
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:28,720
ruin America. This is human nature. New things are scary. The technology made

62
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:33,560
before you were born was flat out unusable. Everything going forward is

63
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:40,040
unnecessary, and only the time in which you grew up will be just right. With that

64
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:46,080
said, yes, I love the idea of the metaverse of a VR world, but Facebook is

65
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:51,360
fucking evil. I have the utmost respect for Oculus and its engineers and the man

66
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:57,240
from it himself. But even the best product can be ruined by upper management. And

67
00:05:57,240 --> 00:06:02,800
Facebook does nothing but ruin things. I'm not even going to go into all the shit

68
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:07,560
they've done because you probably know about it. It is not a hot take to say

69
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:14,560
Facebook bad. It's simply factual. So why is Facebook doing this then? Why are

70
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:19,760
they the ones that are heading up this giant push for not only VR, but the

71
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:25,080
metaverse? Well, that's actually quite simple. In recent years, VR has gone from

72
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:30,320
massive, bulky headsets tethered to computers to standalone devices to

73
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:35,320
goggles. In many ways, it mimics another market that was fledgling for decades

74
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:43,520
before it exploded, the smartphone. By 2017, it had sold 8.5 billion times, more

75
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:49,520
than one for each person on the planet. Media itself shifted to cater to this

76
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:55,520
market. Now, I believe this might happen to VR, maybe at least a fraction of this

77
00:06:55,520 --> 00:07:00,280
kind of growth. But even if that's the case, that's more than a billion units.

78
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:05,360
Facebook seems to see this too. And there's a real chance that in 10, 15

79
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:10,440
years, head mounted displays will become the successor to the smartphone. If that

80
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:14,920
happens, the power dynamic between these massive corporations will shift once

81
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:19,840
more. All of these companies have other products that can survive regardless of

82
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:25,280
whether the smartphone or VR is the most popular computing method. But Facebook

83
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:30,640
just has social media. Social media doesn't cultivate users based on features

84
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:35,480
and quality. It's a snowball effect. If your friends and family are on this

85
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:40,120
platform, you will use that. You likely joined Facebook in the first place

86
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:44,120
because your friends were on there, your family. Remember that MySpace was

87
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:48,960
actually pretty big when Facebook took the reins? It had about 100 million users

88
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:53,920
at its peak. But it was the disruptive technology of the smartphone that made

89
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:59,000
Facebook become what it is today. And this is Facebook's biggest fear that VR

90
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:03,760
will make all of its existing services irrelevant. Users will gravitate towards

91
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:09,280
VR social networks or even the traditional phone apps of those services.

92
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:13,440
And Facebook does not want to be behind the curve. So now they're betting on

93
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:18,640
this. Whether this manifests into something of quality or value, that's

94
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:24,640
another question. But yeah, Facebook's metaverse. It's not really a metaverse.

95
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:29,640
As I said before, that would have to be an open platform. Without this, unless

96
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:34,560
they're connecting Facebook's metaverse and Epic's metaverse and Microsoft's

97
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:39,400
metaverse all together and allowing anybody to make their own and jump in,

98
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:45,760
this is not a metaverse. This is PlayStation Home in VR. 2018 documents

99
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:50,960
laying out the metaverse from Facebook leaked. This included plans to buy out

100
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:56,720
game developers to fuel this and the sole goal of crushing competition. They

101
00:08:56,720 --> 00:09:01,120
don't care if it's good or the best. They just don't want anybody else

102
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:06,520
getting in. The metaverse is not ready. It will not be ready for years. But

103
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:10,880
Facebook wants to discourage somebody else from trying to make their own. This

104
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:16,680
whole story is written like satire. It's big evil corporation wants to build the

105
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:22,600
thing from a 1990s novel that was criticizing big evil corporations.

106
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:29,280
All right, perfect.
