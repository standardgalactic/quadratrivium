00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,440
This video is sponsored by Ground News, more from them in a bit.

2
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:10,560
Miriam Webster defines AI as a three-toed sloth.

3
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:16,700
According to Al Perkins, a sloth is a slow-moving arboreal mammal, and the name AI was given

4
00:00:16,700 --> 00:00:20,280
to this creature because of its high-pitched screech.

5
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:21,280
Fascinating.

6
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:26,040
Artificial intelligence, on the other hand, is the ability for computer systems and algorithms

7
00:00:26,040 --> 00:00:29,680
to imitate intelligent human behavior.

8
00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:31,920
This is not anything new.

9
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:36,080
The technology dates back to nearly the beginning of computers.

10
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:41,800
But obviously, the AI that is gaining all the hype today isn't quite the same as the

11
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:47,600
enemies in your video games or the countless chatbots that have been around for decades.

12
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:52,360
Clearly, chatGPT is not the same as Clippy.

13
00:00:52,360 --> 00:00:53,760
Probably?

14
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:56,280
This whole AI thing is complicated.

15
00:00:56,280 --> 00:01:00,320
We don't know the ultimate potential of large language models and neural networks

16
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:05,880
and blah, blah, blah, but at the same time, it doesn't take a genius to figure out that

17
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:12,040
the letters A and I are being used as much as possible by corporations looking to increase

18
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:13,720
their share values.

19
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:20,560
If a company so much as utters AI, investors cannot help but invest.

20
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:25,520
Even if they have no idea what it means, or what it does, or what it might do, they just

21
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:28,640
assume it's going to make money.

22
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:33,800
NVIDIA, which was well known for being the producer of GPUs for gaming PCs and other

23
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:40,320
computing products, has gone from a successful company to, well, the third largest on the

24
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:41,320
planet.

25
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:48,960
It has seen an increase in value that is nothing short of obscene, all thanks to this AI.

26
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:54,120
Microsoft is now the most valuable corporation on the planet, as the company is all aboard

27
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:59,920
the AI hype train, pushing it into every corner of their operating system and having

28
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:04,520
an extremely close relationship with open AI.

29
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:09,920
All the while, nobody can seem to agree on whether this technology will change the very

30
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:15,040
fabric of our society, or prove to be another flash in the pan.

31
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:20,440
Tech fad, everyone, everyone has an opinion.

32
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:26,360
I'm exhausted of seeing this back and forth argument that never seems to reach any conclusion.

33
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:31,160
And speaking of, Ground News is a website and app that gathers related articles from

34
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:36,760
more than 50,000 sources around the world in one place so you can compare how different

35
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:39,240
outlets cover the same story.

36
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:44,120
Each story comes with a clear breakdown of the political bias, ownership, and headlines

37
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:50,080
of the sources reporting, all backed by ratings from three independent news monitoring organizations.

38
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:54,080
Take a look at the story about how open AI is setting up a safety and security committee

39
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:58,320
as it starts training for the next frontier model, something that has caused a lot of

40
00:02:58,320 --> 00:03:02,640
controversies as previous safety team leaders have recently left the company.

41
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:09,320
This story has been covered by more than 73 sources, with 37% of them leaning left, while

42
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:10,960
14% leans right.

43
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:16,000
You can also see the ownership information, and for this story, 40% of the reporting outlets

44
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,320
are owned by media conglomerates.

45
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:22,060
You can even compare headlines to see how this bias can affect framing.

46
00:03:22,060 --> 00:03:26,320
We can compare headlines quickly and see how some organizations will stoke the public's

47
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:31,440
existing fears about AI to get clicks, while others might capitalize on the distrust that

48
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:34,960
Sam Altman has garnered over the past few months.

49
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:38,720
Ground News has this feature called Blind Spot, which instantly shows you stories that the

50
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:43,720
left-leaning or right-leaning news media conveniently won't report on.

51
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:49,720

53
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:57,600
use to get unlimited access to all of their features.

54
00:03:57,600 --> 00:04:03,400
I think Ground News is an exceptionally important website, and one you absolutely need to check

55
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:04,400
out.

56
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:05,800
Now, back to the video.

57
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:10,840
Yes, AI has been around for a while, dating back to the earliest computers, but the hype

58
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:14,640
right now surrounds progress on large language models.

59
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:19,920
These are programs that take a lot of information in, require a user prompt, and through complex

60
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:24,680
algorithms basically create probabilities of what the output should be.

61
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:29,040
As lifelike as they might seem, these things are not actually alive.

62
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:31,160
There's no thinking involved.

63
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:34,080
They cannot create wholly original or novel ideas.

64
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:37,320
They require training data to do anything.

65
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:42,360
I've seen it suggested that one of the best ways to prove this is to ask a question with

66
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:47,120
an answer that the AI model has not been provided with in its training data.

67
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:53,120
For example, go to chatGPT and ask, what's the 21st letter in this sentence?

68
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:58,840
You might get a different response, but I got the AI saying confidently, it's E. And

69
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:03,840
if you say, I don't think that's right, it will try and count again and give you a

70
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:05,000
different letter.

71
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,920
This time, I.

72
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:12,040
It will sometimes interpret two and one as letters, maybe the apostrophe.

73
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:18,480
And the reason questions like this break the AI is because it doesn't actually understand

74
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:20,680
what a letter is.

75
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:26,400
It doesn't understand anything, but it searches the internet and its training data for the

76
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:28,760
most likely answer.

77
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:34,680
Even with these limitations, the technology is clearly capable of some impressive things.

78
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:40,280
Some assisting you in writing computer programs to proofreading your short stories, to helping

79
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:42,040
you cheat on your homework.

80
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:48,520
But even still, a lot of what gets promoted as AI isn't really AI.

81
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:54,120
A lot of the revolutionary abilities that AI has been reported to have is actually stuff

82
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:58,840
that traditional software has been capable of doing for a long time.

83
00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:04,360
This creates a problem where the idea of this technology, it's often more valuable than

84
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:06,960
what it can actually do.

85
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:12,400
Because again, just saying AI makes stock number go up.

86
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:17,280
So a while back, Amazon launched a real-life store, a brick-and-mortar shop where customers

87
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:22,600
could walk in, grab items off the shelf, put them in their carts, and leave without ever

88
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:24,280
checking out.

89
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:28,360
These items were automatically charged to people's accounts without any need to speak

90
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:32,000
to a cashier or even use a self-serve system.

91
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,040
It was all done automatically.

92
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:39,440
Many assume this was handled using an array of computers and sensors and scanners, but

93
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:45,000
in reality, the company just probably hired a lot of Indian employees to watch people

94
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,800
while they shopped on cameras.

95
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:52,200
And then they would charge the user's Amazon account.

96
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:57,280
Google was caught off guard by the immediate success of ChatGPT and has been trying its

97
00:06:57,280 --> 00:07:00,760
hardest to launch its own AI competitor.

98
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:06,120
They paid millions of dollars to Reddit for access to the website's posts to train their

99
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:10,920
AI with and it went about as well as you'd expect.

100
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:15,840
When users asked questions like how to make your cheese stick on pizza, Google decided

101
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:19,680
the best answer was to use non-toxic glue.

102
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:26,160
This information, by the way, was provided by an 11-year-old Reddit post by user Fucksmith,

103
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:31,520
which Google's model decided was the most reliable source for information.

104
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:36,920
When asked about how many rocks you should eat a day, it did not give the correct answer

105
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:38,840
of zero.

106
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:41,800
And look, things just kept getting worse from here.

107
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:47,480
As you can imagine, any technology that uses the internet to train itself is probably going

108
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:49,080
to make a few mistakes.

109
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:55,240
And those mistakes have made AI a very easy and fun punching bag right now.

110
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:58,520
But yeah, not all AIs are created equally.

111
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:04,320
You can't say that LLMs or machine learning or neural networks are completely useless

112
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:08,400
because, well, a lot of people are using it.

113
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:10,080
There's potential here.

114
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:15,880
Natural language programming could allow people to write their own programs with no code required,

115
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:22,120
just describing what kind of application they want to make and the AI would handle the rest.

116
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:27,960
You could use this to learn to research information, but again, AI can be wrong.

117
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:31,160
So I view it in the same way that I view Wikipedia.

118
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:36,560
It's useful, it's a nice jumping off point, but you need to check your sources.

119
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:41,600
It's not 100% accurate, or compiling lots of data really quickly to get back at your

120
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:43,920
homeowner's association.

121
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:45,640
This does have real value.

122
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:50,680
Automatic translations, transcriptions, stuff that may have been possible with previous

123
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:53,920
software is just more accessible than ever.

124
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:56,480
But people are taking this too far.

125
00:08:56,480 --> 00:09:02,560
The end goal of open AI is to achieve artificial general intelligence.

126
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:10,040
AGI is supposed to refer to a strong AI that can learn skills in tasks that it was never

127
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:11,440
trained to learn.

128
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:17,800
This could lead to machine sentience, consciousness, the singularity.

129
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:22,360
And right now, everyone seems to believe that if you just keep throwing more computing

130
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:31,200
power, more energy, more information into these algorithms, you can simply manifest AGI from

131
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:34,520
the kinds of artificial intelligence we have today.

132
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:39,440
Everybody has a different way of defining AGI because, well, nobody really knows what

133
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:40,960
it's supposed to look like.

134
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:46,440
We often divide AI into two categories, weak AI and strong AI.

135
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:52,120
Weak AI is capable of doing very specific tasks, stuff it was programmed to do, and

136
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:56,720
everything we've ever made so far has been a weak AI.

137
00:09:56,720 --> 00:10:02,120
AGI would be a strong AI, and it could do a lot of jobs.

138
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:05,200
It could do a lot of stuff, would put you out of a job.

139
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:08,200
But what might this look like exactly?

140
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:14,960
There are a few different tests for AGI, but I've always found that the best would be

141
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:18,920
something done with an actual robot in a Tamaton.

142
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:23,520
Take a robot and ask it to repair the plumbing electrical systems and appliances of an early

143
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:30,000
20th century home, especially if none of that information is available through documentation

144
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
on the internet.

145
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:34,520
Every home is going to be slightly different, so the robot will need to make assumptions

146
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:40,760
to learn to understand why your custom 1950s toaster is not working and then try and figure

147
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:46,440
out, possibly through trial and error, how to get it back into toast making condition.

148
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:51,720
While today there are demos of robots completing simple tasks in the home, these are in controlled

149
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:58,080
environments and are only possible because of training data created from previous experiences.

150
00:10:58,080 --> 00:11:04,200
This AGI robot would need to be capable of learning from unique situations, to ask questions

151
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:08,200
based on its own volition, and solve them by itself.

152
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:11,680
But there is no proof that this will happen.

153
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:16,560
In fact, studies do seem to suggest that there are diminishing returns when it comes to this

154
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:17,720
kind of stuff.

155
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:23,800
We don't know if any of this is even possible with traditional silicon chips and programming,

156
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:26,160
binary code, any of that.

157
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:30,200
It could take entirely new forms of computing to achieve this.

158
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:34,680
We don't fully understand how the human brain works, so attempting to replicate it

159
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:40,520
with far more simplistic technology, far more rigid technology, it just seems more than

160
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:42,400
a bit optimistic.

161
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:47,240
People are acting like we're five years away from robots taking every job, becoming alive,

162
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:51,240
enslaving humanity, changing life forever.

163
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:55,560
And honestly, chatGPT could be a stepping stone to all of this.

164
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:57,760
A stepping stone to AGI.

165
00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:04,440
In the same way that the discovery of gunpowder was a stepping stone to the nuke.

166
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:09,800
Or the hot air balloon was a stepping stone to intergalactic spaceflight.

167
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:12,520
That is to say, not much of a step at all.

168
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:17,240
For all we know, LLMs and AGI might not even be related.

169
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:19,640
We might not even be on the right track.

170
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:22,000
We just don't know.

171
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:29,720
So if we don't even know if this can manifest into some more powerful AI, if we have no substantial

172
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:35,360
evidence to support that we're on the road to AGI, then why all the hype?

173
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:39,920
Obviously, it is incorporation's best interest for people to believe that this technology

174
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:46,520
is on the cusp of being something truly revolutionary, so good it's frightening.

175
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:50,440
It makes it seem way more advanced than it actually is.

176
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:55,280
It implies more potential for growth, which will make the stock number go up.

177
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:58,560
And they have ways to market this technology.

178
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:04,240
So many companies are just throwing around the words AI, even if it doesn't even apply

179
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:06,720
to their products in any way.

180
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:12,760
Gigabyte, which usually makes gaming-centric motherboards and memory thingies and whatnot.

181
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:17,720
Well they decided they wanted to go all in on the AI thing and have rebranded their products

182
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:21,160
with a big ole AI plastered on the side of them.

183
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:25,680
Yeah, rebranded, because it's really just kind of the same stuff you could find anywhere

184
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:26,680
else.

185
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:30,600
It's got AI written on it, whatever that means.

186
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:35,360
This exact same thing happened a few years back with the whole metaverse craze, where

187
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:40,280
every company started proclaiming that their existing video games and online services were

188
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:45,960
already in fact metaverses because investors wanted to hear that.

189
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:50,120
And it diluted the term to such a point that the word metaverse started to mean nothing

190
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:53,640
more than just a synonym for software.

191
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:59,680
When an AI makes a mistake, the companies call it a hallucination, which is a very misleading

192
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:00,680
term.

193
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:06,280
This is applying a human quality to the machine, when in reality it's not hallucinating.

194
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:11,360
It's just taking a set of probabilities and it hasn't received enough training data on

195
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:15,800
the topic or the right algorithms to give you an accurate answer.

196
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:17,360
It is not hallucinating.

197
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:19,200
It simply made a mistake.

198
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:22,480
The technology simply wasn't good enough.

199
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:23,800
Will it improve?

200
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:30,080
Yes, but we don't know how good it will get or how accurate it will become.

201
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:37,960
For AI sentience, it could be 5 years away or 10 or 100 or 1000 or it might not be possible

202
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:40,400
for us to build this at all.

203
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:44,840
We don't know and everything else until it happens is just a guess.

204
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:50,440
A lot of the AI safety you hear about actually does refer to more realistic concerns about

205
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:52,720
how this technology might be used.

206
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:58,600
If in the future, AI services become a replacement for traditional search engines like Google,

207
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:03,840
if people rely on ChatGPT to get all their news, then those in charge of the service

208
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:10,240
can lie, manipulate or alter information to benefit those who are in charge of the AI

209
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:13,920
to push their own motives, their own agendas.

210
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:19,640
This is where the concerns of safety often lie, not in the fantasy of robots taking over

211
00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:20,640
the world.

212
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:24,080
Or at least that's where the fears should lie.

213
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:29,600
And look, if fancy quantum computing or something entirely unprecedented allows for a robot

214
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:36,840
revolution, allows for AGI, if today's technology and LLMs are on the right path to all of

215
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:42,560
this, and all we need is just a few trillion dollars in the combined power consumption

216
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:46,800
of a small nation, I'll be the first to admit I was wrong.

217
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:53,080
Oopsie daisy, egg on my face, but right now I'm just a little bit skeptical.

218
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:58,720
So for the purposes of this video, let's assume that the future of AI is not revolutionary,

219
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:00,360
but evolutionary.

220
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:04,120
And if that's the case, is it a bubble?

221
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:08,840
Yes, yes it is, but that doesn't mean it's worthless.

222
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:13,320
I kind of see AI right now like the dot com boom of the late 90s.

223
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:17,240
This was a time where investors believed that every single website was going to make millions

224
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:18,240
of dollars.

225
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:22,800
And once they figured out that only certain websites would ever become popular, would

226
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:26,800
ever become profitable, many of them took their money and ran.

227
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:30,560
The resulting fallout led to the dot com bubble burst.

228
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:35,300
But this wasn't the end of the worldwide web.

229
00:16:35,300 --> 00:16:41,240
Now I'm not saying that AI will be as important as the internet, but clearly this is more

230
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:44,560
than just a simple fad that's going to fade away.

231
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:49,400
I do think the bubble will burst, and then the industry will have to realistically look

232
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:54,920
at its value rather than rely on unfounded promises and rampant speculation.

233
00:16:54,920 --> 00:17:00,720
But yeah, AI is here to stay, because it's been here for a long time.

234
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:04,320
AI already has changed our world.

235
00:17:04,320 --> 00:17:08,840
Algorithms drive search engines, YouTube channel recommendations, most of the internet

236
00:17:08,840 --> 00:17:11,160
is driven off of this automation.

237
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:16,680
We know that the technology has value because it's been around for a while.

238
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:23,460
The question is whether this new form of AI, LLMs, will have a significant impact on how

239
00:17:23,460 --> 00:17:28,200
we live and work, or how significant of an impact that might be.

240
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:31,920
And a lot of people seem to have some doubts about all of this.

241
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:36,480
Rooters Institute for the Study of Journalism pulled 12,000 people from six different countries

242
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:39,120
online about their opinions on AI.

243
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:44,840
Granted, 12,000 people is not that many, doing polls online does not mean perfect results,

244
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:47,880
but this is about as good as we're going to get if we're trying to figure out what

245
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:52,080
the average person thinks about this technology.

246
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:57,480
And most people have no idea what it is, or what it does, or what it could do.

247
00:17:57,480 --> 00:18:03,440
A lot of people have heard of AI in these new services, but they don't know what distinguishes

248
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:07,800
a large language model from traditional computer software.

249
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:13,520
You can tell that most people are not using AI that often, even if chat GPT has a huge

250
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:15,160
install base.

251
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:18,840
Younger people are more likely to try it out than older people, obviously.

252
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:23,600
But most people view AI as a technology that will primarily be used in professional settings

253
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:29,880
by scientists in social media companies, but less so by the average person and their daily

254
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:30,880
lives.

255
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:35,960
Again, if these people don't actually know what AI is, considering some of these poor

256
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:42,520
results, none of this is super helpful, but there is some stuff we can take away from

257
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:43,520
this.

258
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:48,160
It seems like people aren't just confused by the technology, they seem to fundamentally

259
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:49,240
dislike it.

260
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:52,000
There are a lot of concerns about the damage it can do.

261
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:56,600
People are scared it will take their jobs away, or just functions as tools to manipulate

262
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:57,600
the public.

263
00:18:57,600 --> 00:19:02,920
And most don't seem interested in the positive aspects of this technology at all.

264
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:05,920
Most can't even identify what that might be.

265
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:11,600
Because a technology does need to be more than good enough, it needs to be perfect.

266
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:15,960
When driving a school bus or doing taxes for a multi-trillion dollar corporation, you

267
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:22,440
probably don't want to put this responsibility on a robot that can, or probably will, make

268
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:23,440
a mistake.

269
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:25,440
Yes, humans are not perfect.

270
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:31,440
The AI might even be better than the human in many cases, but humans give people somebody

271
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:34,240
to blame when things go wrong.

272
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:40,880
They provide accountability, something that the AI just doesn't have for AI.

273
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:46,840
Google spent all of Google I.O. 2024 talking about its AI initiatives, and people didn't

274
00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:48,480
really seem to care all that much.

275
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:53,200
A lot of people just rolled their eyes because it's more AI slop.

276
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:58,960
Microsoft hyped up its new line of AI PCs, which most saw as a concerning invasion of

277
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:03,320
privacy rather than anything remotely worthwhile.

278
00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:08,520
The corporation is betting the future of its operating system, of the Windows operating

279
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:13,840
system on AI, and it's a bet that doesn't seem to be panning out.

280
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:19,160
In fact, I've seen a lot more people talk about moving to Linux now that Windows is

281
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:22,560
infected with this AI garbage.

282
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:28,720
I have no doubt going forward that LLMs and machine learning and AI will manifest into

283
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:30,720
something valuable.

284
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:36,400
It's possible this might even result in massive changes to everyday life, but right now this

285
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:42,800
entire thing has been polluted by bad actors, false promises, and in my opinion, pretty

286
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:48,080
misleading marketing tactics, and it's baffling to me that people have just forgotten the

287
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:55,000
whole metaverse craze from a few years back, where the word itself began to mean nothing

288
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,160
by the end.

289
00:20:56,160 --> 00:21:00,960
These analysts, who don't even understand the basic technology, are hyping up others

290
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:06,840
about how much money we're all apparently about to make, claiming that Nvidia is going

291
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:13,320
to be worth $10 trillion in just a few years, and as far as I can tell, there's just no

292
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:16,280
reasonable basis for these claims.

293
00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:21,080
We've reached a point where Big Tech is so desperate to achieve growth that it just

294
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:26,240
keeps taking these fairly predictable and standard advancements and software and then

295
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:33,080
applying new buzzwords to the technology, and by the time the bubble should burst, they're

296
00:21:33,080 --> 00:21:36,080
already onto marketing their next buzzword.

297
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:41,080
I don't want to dismiss the entire potential of AI by calling it the next metaverse, but

298
00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:43,800
look, there's a lot of problems here.

299
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:48,680
And as of right now, for many people, this technology just kind of comes off as a slightly

300
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:55,360
more invasive, less accurate version of all these digital personal assistants that have

301
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:58,060
already become commonplace over the years.

302
00:21:58,060 --> 00:22:02,520
This whole industry right now just seems so flimsy to me.

303
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:05,760
There's a good chance that everything I say here will age like milk.

304
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:07,080
I get that.

305
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:12,160
Maybe we will see a world where most jobs become significantly easier with the assistance

306
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:17,320
of the machines, where this is a necessity, or maybe the tech is too good and we all lose

307
00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:18,320
our jobs.

308
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:24,120
I think right now we're seeing a technology that is more style over substance.

309
00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:28,720
There is substance there, but there's just a lot of fluff here.

310
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:32,440
Or maybe I'm completely wrong, and in five years we'll all have Rosie the Robot in our

311
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:33,440
homes.

312
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:35,840
I need to get my robot out of my swimming pool.

313
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:37,800
I don't think she can breathe.
