0	5380	So a few years ago me and a friend were attending a college. It was the end of the
5380	10620	semester and we had a big final project. Create a business pitch and show it to
10620	14900	some investors. Now this was an early computer engineering course and I was a
14900	19060	terrible student. My friend said hey do whatever you want so I waited a few weeks
19060	24180	until the the final day and I was gonna start the project. I came up with my
24180	29140	dream idea. It was called VR funzo or something stupid like that. Keep in mind
29140	34140	VR was barely relevant at this time but it sounded cool to investors right? It was
34140	40380	a large grandiose spanning an innovative social network where users could live a
40380	47380	second life. You get it? I think you played ping-pong to mine cryptocurrency or
47380	53060	you could just get money by watching an ad. You could use this money these fun
53060	59060	bucks to buy cars, buy things for your house, just buy things. You could hang
59060	63780	out with other people and show them your cool things and out of the 20-page
63780	68500	paper 15 pages were just bullet points that described the various cats that
68500	72620	you could buy in the game. Beneath that was the various hats that you could buy
72620	77820	for those various cats. It wasn't the most original idea. This is permeated
77820	82660	fiction for a good while but you know I always liked that idea. Maybe not the
82660	86920	mining for crypto part but having a place where you can you can just hang
86920	93340	out with people and VR and have your various hats in your various cats.
96260	109540	Alright perfect. Oh hi Mark. Oh oh oh no. The word meta is obviously in reference
109540	113900	to the metaverse. That's what Facebook's doing here. And in many ways this has
113900	120300	become the new buzzword for tech companies and journalists, investors. Pretty soon
120300	124260	we're gonna have the Fortnite metaverse and Microsoft announced its own
124260	130660	metaverse for business. And Facebook is this. It's all very corporate. It's all
130660	136600	very cringy. But is there something there? No but but I'll get to that. What
136620	140800	exactly is the metaverse? That's something that a lot of people seem to
140800	145480	misunderstand. We've called it a digital living world where you can socialize,
145480	150720	make money, hang out, do anything you want. But there's a key factor that people
150720	157240	seem to forget. Well a lot of factors. One, it has to be in VR. So no, regardless of
157240	161520	what you've seen on Twitter, Second Life and MMOs and all this stuff is not a
161520	167360	metaverse. The internet itself is not a metaverse because it has to be in VR.
167360	172880	Secondly, it's got to be open source. Nobody can be in control of it, not owned
172880	178560	by a singular entity. In this way it is like the internet. But finally, and most
178560	184080	importantly, it's not real. It's literally a work of fiction. The metaverse is a
184080	190320	place in the world of Neil Stevenson's 1992 novel Snow Crash. That's it. That's
190360	195560	where this word came from. It's a book. I won't go too in-depth in the story here
195560	200040	because there'll be a whole video on that at some point. But in short, the
200040	204760	metaverse is an entirely open VR platform and in this place people are
204760	208880	represented by avatars. They can communicate with others, go to various
208880	214440	locations, buy a house, earn a living, whatever. It's the direct inspiration for
214440	219360	every VR world story you have ever heard. In the story, the metaverse is so
219440	224680	important because the outside world is awful. It's a chaotic dystopian
224680	229400	landscape where various corporations control limited city-states across the
229400	234000	nation. Hyperinflation makes a billion dollars useless. You're going to need
234000	238840	trillions to buy a lightbulb. The core concept of the metaverse is intended to
238840	244360	be escapism. Your status in society is more so defined whether you know how to
244360	249560	write code, make programs, create models, or contribute to the larger metaverse.
249680	254200	It's entirely open in nature and hobbyists can contribute whatever they
254200	259280	want to make the metaverse a better place. The story is meant as part speculative
259280	264800	futurism, social commentary, and a parody of many of the cyberpunk tropes. Our
264800	269680	main character is a pizza driver for the mob who happens to be a hacker. His
269720	275520	name is literally hero protagonist. But the humor right now is that the top
275520	281720	corporations in our world are interested in creating their own metaverses. As
281720	286800	TechRadar points out, this concept is literally the antagonist's plan in
286800	291720	Ready Player One. The only difference here is that there never is a free
291720	296960	metaverse. It starts broken. Now I'm not going to lie, I love the idea of the
296960	302880	metaverse of a VR world. Disruptive Tech is disruptive for a reason. It will never
302880	307880	be obvious when it's coming. And most people won't think it's a good idea.
307880	312800	I've talked about on this channel how in the 90s the internet was deemed a fad.
312800	317360	The rhetoric surrounding the smartphone was that people were too addicted to
317360	322720	technology. The television was seen as a cesspool of culture, something that would
322720	328720	ruin America. This is human nature. New things are scary. The technology made
328720	333560	before you were born was flat out unusable. Everything going forward is
333560	340040	unnecessary, and only the time in which you grew up will be just right. With that
340040	346080	said, yes, I love the idea of the metaverse of a VR world, but Facebook is
346080	351360	fucking evil. I have the utmost respect for Oculus and its engineers and the man
351400	357240	from it himself. But even the best product can be ruined by upper management. And
357240	362800	Facebook does nothing but ruin things. I'm not even going to go into all the shit
362800	367560	they've done because you probably know about it. It is not a hot take to say
367560	374560	Facebook bad. It's simply factual. So why is Facebook doing this then? Why are
374560	379760	they the ones that are heading up this giant push for not only VR, but the
379760	385080	metaverse? Well, that's actually quite simple. In recent years, VR has gone from
385080	390320	massive, bulky headsets tethered to computers to standalone devices to
390320	395320	goggles. In many ways, it mimics another market that was fledgling for decades
395320	403520	before it exploded, the smartphone. By 2017, it had sold 8.5 billion times, more
403520	409520	than one for each person on the planet. Media itself shifted to cater to this
409520	415520	market. Now, I believe this might happen to VR, maybe at least a fraction of this
415520	420280	kind of growth. But even if that's the case, that's more than a billion units.
420280	425360	Facebook seems to see this too. And there's a real chance that in 10, 15
425360	430440	years, head mounted displays will become the successor to the smartphone. If that
430440	434920	happens, the power dynamic between these massive corporations will shift once
434920	439840	more. All of these companies have other products that can survive regardless of
439840	445280	whether the smartphone or VR is the most popular computing method. But Facebook
445280	450640	just has social media. Social media doesn't cultivate users based on features
450640	455480	and quality. It's a snowball effect. If your friends and family are on this
455480	460120	platform, you will use that. You likely joined Facebook in the first place
460120	464120	because your friends were on there, your family. Remember that MySpace was
464160	468960	actually pretty big when Facebook took the reins? It had about 100 million users
468960	473920	at its peak. But it was the disruptive technology of the smartphone that made
473920	479000	Facebook become what it is today. And this is Facebook's biggest fear that VR
479000	483760	will make all of its existing services irrelevant. Users will gravitate towards
483760	489280	VR social networks or even the traditional phone apps of those services.
489280	493440	And Facebook does not want to be behind the curve. So now they're betting on
493440	498640	this. Whether this manifests into something of quality or value, that's
498640	504640	another question. But yeah, Facebook's metaverse. It's not really a metaverse.
504640	509640	As I said before, that would have to be an open platform. Without this, unless
509640	514560	they're connecting Facebook's metaverse and Epic's metaverse and Microsoft's
514560	519400	metaverse all together and allowing anybody to make their own and jump in,
519480	525760	this is not a metaverse. This is PlayStation Home in VR. 2018 documents
525760	530960	laying out the metaverse from Facebook leaked. This included plans to buy out
531000	536720	game developers to fuel this and the sole goal of crushing competition. They
536720	541120	don't care if it's good or the best. They just don't want anybody else
541120	546520	getting in. The metaverse is not ready. It will not be ready for years. But
546520	550880	Facebook wants to discourage somebody else from trying to make their own. This
550880	556680	whole story is written like satire. It's big evil corporation wants to build the
556680	562600	thing from a 1990s novel that was criticizing big evil corporations.
562600	569280	All right, perfect.
