00:00.000 --> 00:24.640
Hey everyone, this is James Lindsay, you are listening to the New Discourses podcast.

00:24.640 --> 00:30.000
And finally, after months of anticipation, after many times on Twitter of this blowing

00:30.000 --> 00:33.040
up, I want to talk to you about Hegel.

00:33.040 --> 00:39.280
I've been promising to talk about the Hegelian idea for a while, I've been tweeting about

00:39.280 --> 00:40.280
it.

00:40.280 --> 00:43.360
Something peculiar happens every time you tweet about Hegel and you get too close.

00:43.360 --> 00:49.640
For example, if you point out that wokeism is a Hegelian religion, especially if you

00:49.640 --> 00:57.800
point out that wokeism is a hermetic religion based in the dialectical philosophy of Hegel.

00:57.800 --> 01:00.440
Something weird happens, people go berserk.

01:00.440 --> 01:06.080
You end up or I end up at least getting bombed by people in kind of disproportionate fashion

01:06.080 --> 01:09.880
and something very inorganic begins to happen in many of these cases.

01:09.880 --> 01:14.800
Of course, there's a usual making fun of me, but lots of very obviously leftist accounts

01:14.800 --> 01:17.440
kind of lose their mind, pop up on my radar.

01:17.440 --> 01:21.760
And what will happen is stuff that's just not quite real, something that's hyper real

01:21.760 --> 01:22.760
in a sense.

01:22.760 --> 01:29.640
And that'll be that somebody will throw a dunk and somebody with maybe just a few dozen

01:29.640 --> 01:38.480
followers will reply to something maybe in dunk fashion and a reply tweet from an account

01:38.480 --> 01:42.920
that's not very big will somehow get hundreds of likes sometimes in a very small amount

01:42.920 --> 01:43.920
of time.

01:43.920 --> 01:44.920
It's not organic behavior.

01:44.920 --> 01:51.640
Something weird going on with Hegel and this has driven me to want to understand more of

01:51.640 --> 01:52.640
Hegel.

01:52.640 --> 01:56.520
Hegel is of course relevant to everybody who knows much about Marx knows that Hegel is

01:56.520 --> 02:00.320
relevant to Marx and I want to make the case that Hegel is relevant to what's going on

02:00.320 --> 02:06.360
and in fact that we can understand the woke ideology or woke worldview as a better way

02:06.360 --> 02:13.640
to put it, the worldview of critical social justice also known as theory as a Hegelian

02:13.760 --> 02:15.040
faith.

02:15.040 --> 02:19.600
And so to begin, this is probably going to go pretty long because I want to do this

02:19.600 --> 02:20.600
in depth.

02:20.600 --> 02:22.320
I want to get it all there.

02:22.320 --> 02:24.040
I have copious notes for this.

02:24.040 --> 02:29.440
I want to just read to you something that might not stick out to you otherwise from

02:29.440 --> 02:31.120
critical race theory and introduction.

02:31.120 --> 02:34.040
This is by Richard Delgado and Jean Stefansic.

02:34.040 --> 02:38.320
It's a typical fundamental textbook in critical race theory.

02:38.320 --> 02:42.080
And I've quoted from it about a bajillion times.

02:42.080 --> 02:49.560
So I just want to read to you this paragraph in the section about essentialism and anti-essentialism.

02:49.560 --> 02:50.560
They write,

02:50.560 --> 02:55.080
Some observers hold that all minority races should compromise their differences and form

02:55.080 --> 02:58.480
a united front against racism in general.

02:58.480 --> 03:03.080
The danger in this essentialized approach is that certain minority groups, socioeconomic

03:03.080 --> 03:08.960
classes and sexual orientations may end up better off and others worse.

03:08.960 --> 03:13.000
Tell how shabbily black women were treated in the civil rights movement of the 1960s,

03:13.000 --> 03:16.560
rarely allowed to speak for the group, made to march in the second row, and relegated

03:16.560 --> 03:19.080
with a few exceptions to support roles.

03:19.080 --> 03:24.600
It has only been relatively recently that black women in Latinas have emerged as powerful

03:24.600 --> 03:27.600
voices on the American scene.

03:27.600 --> 03:32.680
Perhaps the essentialism slash anti-essentialism debate sets in when mainstream thought is

03:32.680 --> 03:37.400
beginning to see the validity in the larger groups' complaints.

03:37.400 --> 03:41.560
Like an automobile with deferred maintenance, smaller subgroups that have until then remained

03:41.560 --> 03:46.880
silent begin bringing suppressed issues to the larger groups' attention.

03:46.880 --> 03:51.360
And so the dialectic progresses.

03:51.360 --> 03:55.360
That's the end of the quote, but let's check that last part.

03:55.360 --> 03:58.640
And so the dialectic progresses.

03:58.640 --> 04:02.360
That word, dialectic, is not there by mistake.

04:02.360 --> 04:06.160
Neither is the idea that's put forth with the dialectic that it's progressing and in

04:06.160 --> 04:11.080
fact neither is the idea that it's progressing into a smaller and more niche area.

04:11.080 --> 04:17.400
So what the argument here is that they're making in this last sentence is that as larger

04:17.400 --> 04:22.320
scale problems seem to be getting sorted out, smaller scale problems get brought up to

04:22.320 --> 04:28.320
the fore and have to be worked out as well, and so the dialectic progresses.

04:28.320 --> 04:30.120
None of this is there by mistake.

04:30.120 --> 04:34.440
So in this episode of the podcast, I want to convince you of two primary things.

04:34.440 --> 04:39.360
They're going to be kind of my north star, I suppose, in communicating this stuff to

04:39.360 --> 04:40.360
you.

04:40.360 --> 04:43.440
One, this idea of dialectic is important.

04:43.440 --> 04:50.240
In fact, it is the operating system of leftists and it has been for almost 200 years.

04:50.240 --> 04:55.160
It's so important that if you don't understand this seemingly quirky word and where it comes

04:55.160 --> 05:00.680
from philosophically, you don't have the slightest idea of what's going on in leftist politics.

05:01.240 --> 05:07.520
Secondly, this dialectic is a method of worship and a broad religious movement that started

05:07.520 --> 05:12.640
primarily with Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel in the early 19th century.

05:12.640 --> 05:18.760
A phenomenology of spirit in 1807 is probably a good bookmark to say when this started.

05:18.760 --> 05:23.160
So we're looking at 214 years since the publication of that book.

05:23.160 --> 05:27.920
His later writings extend into the late 1820s.

05:27.920 --> 05:31.720
So we're looking at roughly 200 years ago.

05:31.720 --> 05:38.840
That broad Hegelian religion has denominations that include Marxism, Neo-Marxism, also known

05:38.840 --> 05:44.360
as critical theory or cultural Marxism, Fabianism, and Wokeness.

05:44.360 --> 05:45.920
So I want to convince you of these two things.

05:45.920 --> 05:52.800
The dialectic is the operating system of leftism and that leftism that's operating dialectically

05:52.800 --> 05:59.680
is in fact a religion that can be traced back to the metaphysics of Hegel.

05:59.680 --> 06:03.440
That's a tall order, but I think it's crucial if you want to understand what's going on

06:03.440 --> 06:08.960
with the woke, why it appears to be religious, why it has many of the features that it does.

06:08.960 --> 06:12.920
If you want to be able to anticipate the moves that it makes, if you want to be able to counter it,

06:12.920 --> 06:15.680
you have to understand it.

06:15.680 --> 06:19.600
The Polish proverb is never attempt to cure that which you don't understand, so I want

06:19.600 --> 06:26.480
to make sure we understand that leftism, in particular this kind of radical leftism,

06:26.480 --> 06:32.160
the line of Marxism, Neo-Marxism, Fabianism, and Wokeness that have really characterized

06:32.160 --> 06:38.960
leftism over the past 200 years, or at least 150 years, starting with Marxism, I guess.

06:38.960 --> 06:46.080
Those are all species within a broader or denominations within a broader religious movement

06:46.080 --> 06:53.680
that relies upon the dialectical approach laid out first in significance by Hegel.

06:53.680 --> 06:57.960
So the rough picture I want to paint, we could go back, the dialectic really finds its first

06:57.960 --> 07:02.840
expression in Kant, we're not going to talk about Kant.

07:02.840 --> 07:07.120
It was developed further by Fichte, we're also not going to talk about Fichte, and there

07:07.120 --> 07:11.560
Hegel picks up the story, so we're going to start with Hegel.

07:11.560 --> 07:14.040
If you want to know more about those other things, you can talk to my friend Stephen

07:14.080 --> 07:19.000
Hicks, or you can listen to or read his book, I listened to it, so I automatically went

07:19.000 --> 07:21.200
to the audiobook explaining postmodernism.

07:21.200 --> 07:26.120
He has some of the relevance of Hegel and Fichte, a number of other thinkers that led

07:26.120 --> 07:28.920
up to before Hegel, but I'm going to begin with Hegel.

07:28.920 --> 07:33.880
So what happened is that Hegel eventually died, but a movement, he was really an electoral

07:33.880 --> 07:42.520
rock star at the time where he was in Germany, and a movement arose around him, or actually

07:42.520 --> 07:47.480
a few movements arose around his systematic philosophy, and the progressive one of these

07:47.480 --> 07:50.240
was known as the Young Hegelian Movement.

07:50.240 --> 07:54.360
The Young Hegelian Movement is what inspired Marx, and Marxism became the definition of

07:54.360 --> 07:59.480
basically everything leftism following Marx, but especially following the success of the

07:59.480 --> 08:06.800
Russian Revolution, it was voiced by Lenin, it also gave rise to Neo-Marxism, and approximately

08:06.800 --> 08:12.400
in a kind of odd and broken way postmodernism, and of course my thesis in cynical theories

08:12.480 --> 08:16.640
which I wrote with Helen Pluckrose, is that Neo-Marxism and postmodernism fused with a

08:16.640 --> 08:20.160
few other things that were going on to form what we now call woke.

08:20.160 --> 08:26.800
So we have this line, Hegel to the Young Hegelian Movement, to Marx via Fauerbach, to Neo-Marxism

08:26.800 --> 08:31.160
and to some degree postmodernism in sort of a broken way to woke, and we have this long

08:31.160 --> 08:36.640
thread running of this one religion that's taking different denominational forms as it's

08:36.640 --> 08:37.880
going through time.

08:37.880 --> 08:42.360
You could say that the woke are in some sense, you could say that in fact in some odd sense

08:42.480 --> 08:48.200
the Neo-Marxists are almost like it's Calvinists or even the woke are like it's Puritans.

08:48.200 --> 08:51.720
If you read something like Robin D'Angelo's wife fragility and you're aware of what a

08:51.720 --> 08:55.600
Puritan confessional tract looks like where they're going through their humiliation after

08:55.600 --> 08:58.600
they believe that they've been saved, it's pretty obvious.

08:58.600 --> 09:03.040
Robin D'Angelo feels as though she has been saved in an anti-racist religion, she knows

09:03.040 --> 09:07.760
that racism is bad, that she feels like she's done the proper atonement that she should

09:07.760 --> 09:12.880
have received grace but because it's a Puritan mindset that she's operating within, she's

09:12.880 --> 09:17.720
got scrupulosity probably which is a form of OCD if I had to guess, can't diagnose her

09:17.720 --> 09:19.280
for sure.

09:19.280 --> 09:25.320
She enters into this humiliation where she tries to repeatedly show that she's utterly

09:25.320 --> 09:30.960
depraved and therefore going to be able to be worthy of justification and then eventually

09:30.960 --> 09:33.080
glorification.

09:34.080 --> 09:35.880
This is the mindset of the woke.

09:35.880 --> 09:40.280
You can see this is a very religious way when you read Robin D'Angelo if you're familiar

09:40.280 --> 09:42.200
with Puritan tracts.

09:42.200 --> 09:47.000
The big idea, there are lots of big ideas in Hegel, lots of things going on.

09:47.000 --> 09:51.920
I want to follow that particular track, Hegel to the Young Hegelian Movement, to Marx to

09:51.920 --> 09:56.560
Neo-Marxism and Postmodernism in a broken way, to the woke.

09:56.560 --> 10:01.080
The one that I want to focus on centrally is this operating system that Hegel laid out

10:01.080 --> 10:07.160
in an applicative way probably for the first time, which is the dialectic.

10:07.160 --> 10:09.680
Dialectic is thesis, antithesis, synthesis.

10:09.680 --> 10:11.320
Those are the words usually here.

10:11.320 --> 10:16.240
You have some idea that's a thesis, you're met with its opposite, that's the antithesis.

10:16.240 --> 10:20.160
You have to contemplate the two, figure out a way to bring them together into something

10:20.160 --> 10:26.600
that unifies the ideas and that's a synthesis that's supposed to provide more information.

10:26.960 --> 10:32.600
A higher understanding is a better way to phrase that, I'm sorry, of the circumstance.

10:32.600 --> 10:37.560
The thesis is an idea that has been forwarded, it misses something, its antithesis reveals

10:37.560 --> 10:42.760
the contradictions from what it's missing and its synthesis arrives out of this.

10:42.760 --> 10:44.760
This can be traced back to Socratic thought.

10:44.760 --> 10:50.960
There are positive and negative versions of this note.

10:50.960 --> 10:56.520
I suppose we should say that Hegel never actually framed the dialectic this way as thesis, antithesis

10:57.120 --> 11:01.200
that's Kant's organization, Hegel borrowed from Kant.

11:01.200 --> 11:05.240
His own formulation was actually abstract negative concrete, so you have an abstract

11:05.240 --> 11:09.560
idea, abstract understanding of something, it meets its negative and that allows you

11:09.560 --> 11:15.240
to derive something concrete from it, which is clearly reflected in the Neo-Marxist literature

11:15.240 --> 11:20.560
repeatedly if you've read it because the Neo-Marxist literature constantly calls for engaging in

11:20.600 --> 11:27.280
so-called negative thinking and negative thinking is bringing that negative to bear, which is

11:27.280 --> 11:32.240
the critique Marx's ruthless criticism of everything that exists that's bringing the

11:32.240 --> 11:37.840
negative to bear on the abstract so that you can synthesize it to the concrete, which

11:37.840 --> 11:42.200
is a concrete solution, which usually for them means something looking like communism.

11:42.200 --> 11:47.280
You can hear this verbiage for example, just to pull one example out of Herbert Marcuse,

11:47.360 --> 11:52.240
I've read Herbert Marcuse's repressive tolerance essay before, I've read selections from his

11:52.240 --> 11:55.680
one-dimensional man, we're going to cover some of both of those again in this episode,

11:56.800 --> 12:01.440
but in his 1969 essay on liberation, which I intend to read for the podcast in full

12:01.440 --> 12:08.800
with commentary fairly soon, I have not read that one yet, but we encounter this paragraph.

12:09.600 --> 12:16.720
Marcuse writes, but the demand to state the concrete alternatives to, say, the failing

12:16.720 --> 12:20.800
states of the world, capitalist states, particularly that he's looking at, but also

12:20.800 --> 12:24.160
the failures of attempted socialist and communist states, he says,

12:24.160 --> 12:29.040
but the demand to state the concrete alternatives is justified for yet another reason.

12:29.760 --> 12:35.920
Negative thinking, there it is, draws whatever force it may have from its empirical basis,

12:35.920 --> 12:40.560
the actual human condition in the given society. So he's like, let's look at the lived experiences,

12:40.560 --> 12:44.480
look where suffering and oppression are, let's tap into those, and we're going to use negative

12:44.480 --> 12:48.400
thinking to do so, and it's empirical because we're looking at the actual experiences people

12:48.400 --> 12:52.720
are having, the actual human condition. And then you're going to compare that, he writes,

12:52.720 --> 12:59.040
and the given possibilities to transcend this condition, to enlarge the realm of freedom.

13:00.320 --> 13:06.320
In this sense, negative thinking is by virtue of its own internal concepts positive. Negative

13:06.320 --> 13:13.680
thinking is positive. Isn't that odd? What he says that means is oriented toward and

13:13.680 --> 13:18.400
comprehending a future which is contained in the present. This containment idea is going to

13:18.400 --> 13:24.000
be very important also that this perfect future, the negative thinking can unleash,

13:24.000 --> 13:27.840
is contained in the present. The philosophy here, the metaphysic here is actually that if we could

13:27.840 --> 13:35.680
just get the problems off of that contained future, then the contained future could emerge.

13:37.520 --> 13:41.920
So what we have here is somebody believing that there's this kind of perfect future,

13:42.000 --> 13:46.080
and if we could just get the problems off of it by using negative thinking, we could peel away

13:46.080 --> 13:51.040
all the problematics, we could expose all the contradictions, we could expose all of the systems

13:51.040 --> 13:57.120
of oppression that prevent it from being perfect, then that seed that's contained within in the

13:57.120 --> 14:01.520
present day would be able to blossom into a fully liberated society. That's the essay on liberation.

14:03.520 --> 14:07.040
That's a very important way. We're going to come back to this again and again. It's a very important

14:07.040 --> 14:10.880
way to understand the way that these people think, and it's crucial to understand that this is a

14:10.880 --> 14:19.600
Hegelian approach. But to go back to Marcuse, he writes, and this containment, which is an

14:19.600 --> 14:23.840
important aspect of the general containment policy pursued by the established societies,

14:24.960 --> 14:30.160
oh sorry, and in this containment, the future appears as possible liberation. So that's what

14:30.160 --> 14:35.200
I was just saying. In the contained within the society, we see the seed of liberation,

14:35.200 --> 14:39.680
the seed of a new society that cannot and does not exist anywhere on earth up to this point.

14:40.320 --> 14:45.360
And he writes, it is not the only alternative, the advent of a long period of civilized barbarism

14:45.920 --> 14:49.600
with or without the nuclear destruction is equally contained in the present. So there

14:49.600 --> 14:55.040
could be good roads or bad roads. Negative thinking and the praxis guided by it is the

14:55.040 --> 15:00.960
positive and positing effort to prevent this utter negativity. So he frames out negative

15:00.960 --> 15:07.680
thinking as positive, and he says that it allows us to peel away the constraints

15:08.480 --> 15:15.040
of a civilized barbarism in the established societies, peel away the problematics, and get

15:15.040 --> 15:22.560
the seed of a more perfected future using negative thinking and the praxis guided by it. Praxis is

15:22.560 --> 15:29.920
what you have when you combine theory, meaning really Hegelian reason, as we're going to see,

15:29.920 --> 15:34.400
but we could say critical theory, we could say postmodern theory, we could say woke or theory,

15:34.400 --> 15:39.520
if you want, what we just call capital T theory, put into practice. That's what praxis is,

15:39.520 --> 15:45.760
it's theory combined with being put into practice. So it's activism on behalf of a theoretical or

15:45.760 --> 15:51.760
ideological model. Well, when we take negative thinking, and we do activism on behalf of that,

15:52.480 --> 15:57.200
then this negative thinking becomes positive because it prevents us from going into the

15:57.200 --> 16:01.520
possible calamities that are also contained in the seed of a more perfect liberated future

16:01.520 --> 16:07.040
could possibly blossom. It's very important, as you'll see, to understand that this is how

16:07.920 --> 16:12.880
this Hegelian religion thinks. Perfected society, we already have the seeds of it,

16:12.880 --> 16:17.520
and we just have to somehow peel away the problems, and then the perfected society will

16:17.520 --> 16:22.320
emerge. If you've listened to my other recent podcast, Communism Doesn't Know How, I go into this

16:22.320 --> 16:26.160
kind of magical thinking that they have, and I actually describe it as alchemical, and you're

16:26.160 --> 16:30.720
going to find out why I describe it as alchemical again and again as we go through this longer

16:31.520 --> 16:38.640
discussion of Hegel and his relevance. So this said, I think we already see then that to understand

16:38.640 --> 16:45.120
both the leftism over the last 200 years, but also Hegel's relevance to that, we have to grapple

16:45.120 --> 16:51.200
with this idea of the dialectic. Because this is, as I said, the operating system beneath all of

16:51.200 --> 16:59.200
leftism, at least since Hegel's time. And it really emerged in the form that we're looking at

16:59.200 --> 17:03.920
in leftism from the progressive school of thought that followed him in the 1820s and 1830s. This

17:03.920 --> 17:08.880
referred to as young Hegelianism. Young Hegelianism, I'm not going to dive deeply into this because

17:08.880 --> 17:14.880
I want to get to Marx and the Neo-Marxists, etc. But in the woke, young Hegelianism has to be

17:14.880 --> 17:20.640
distinguished from old Hegelianism. So Hegel is not particularly easy to decipher, if you haven't

17:20.640 --> 17:27.120
read him. He can be quite difficult to decipher, actually. And so radically different interpretations

17:27.120 --> 17:33.600
of Hegel erupted in the wake of Hegel's later years in death, one of which is young Hegelianism,

17:33.600 --> 17:38.720
which was rampantly progressive, and one of which was old Hegelianism, which was ultra-conservative.

17:39.360 --> 17:43.760
In essence, very briefly, Hegel's philosophy, his systematic philosophy that he laid out,

17:43.760 --> 17:50.320
was supposed to describe the emergence of a perfected state and perfected society

17:51.040 --> 17:57.120
through the perfection of ideas. And the young Hegelians looked around at the world that they

17:57.120 --> 18:01.280
lived in in the 1820s and 1830s in Prussia and said, we're not there yet. There are all kinds

18:01.280 --> 18:04.880
of problems the dialectic has to be applied to. There are all kinds of contradictions

18:05.600 --> 18:11.520
in our experience. Whereas the old Hegelians, being ultra-conservative, looked at the state of

18:11.520 --> 18:16.960
society they lived in and said, aha, Hegel was saying that we're already there. And so Hegel's

18:16.960 --> 18:23.760
dialectic had already fully achieved what it had aimed to do, the absolute as Hegel had it,

18:23.760 --> 18:29.600
and thus the perfected state of society, already had realized itself and emerged in

18:29.600 --> 18:34.560
Prussia at the time, which would then demand that in the sense that history had ended,

18:35.440 --> 18:40.080
capital H history. And so absolutely no change would be needed from this kind of historical

18:40.080 --> 18:47.200
high point, which was a sort of proto-folkish national organization of the Prussian state

18:47.200 --> 18:52.880
in the mid 19th century. So the young Hegelians have to be distinguished from this and that they

18:52.880 --> 18:58.480
looked at this old Hegelian idea and thought, no, no way. There's all kinds of problems. And the

18:58.480 --> 19:06.720
young Hegelians had a student within their ranks, Karl Marx. Karl Marx was a young Hegelian. He was

19:06.720 --> 19:10.880
also influenced by other thinkers, as we'll discuss, who were also in this kind of idealist

19:10.880 --> 19:19.520
tradition. What do we have? Kant develops the dialectic, Fick to develops it further. This

19:19.520 --> 19:25.920
inspires Schelling, who worked alongside, but not with Hegel. And both Schelling and Hegel were

19:25.920 --> 19:35.360
profound influences on Marx. But nevertheless, Marx was actually a young Hegelian. And so we can

19:35.440 --> 19:43.920
just turn to kind of understand the centrality of the dialectic, Hegel's dialectical application

19:44.640 --> 19:51.680
to Marx by going to the marxist.org glossary. I love marxist.org. I love to read this. I love to

19:51.680 --> 19:55.680
see the way the Marxists interpret these terms. It gives you tremendous, I'm writing an encyclopedia

19:55.680 --> 19:59.840
on my own website on new discourses. So it gives me a tremendous insight into how these people

19:59.840 --> 20:04.880
think about their own terms. Of course, the woke are different than the Marxists, but it does give

20:05.440 --> 20:10.160
good historical insight and helps me open up my mind and understand how they use the terms in

20:10.160 --> 20:16.880
multiple ways at once. But reading from the marxist.org glossary, the entry on Hegel, what they

20:16.880 --> 20:21.120
write is the most important representative. This is describing Hegel, the most important

20:21.120 --> 20:27.120
representative of classical German philosophy. He represented an objective idealism, a brilliant

20:27.120 --> 20:34.000
investigator of the laws of dialectic, which he was the first consciously to apply.

20:34.240 --> 20:41.840
Marxists today believe that Hegel began the dialectical application. That dialectical application

20:41.840 --> 20:47.760
is what Marx turned into dialectical materialism, which is the mode by which Marxism progressed

20:47.760 --> 20:53.040
and thought. Sort of the article of faith. It's like the religious engine of Marxism is dialectical

20:53.040 --> 20:58.480
materialism. So we have the kind of just to summarize historically, we have Kant formulae

20:58.480 --> 21:03.440
destructive of the dialectic. This was developed further by Fichte, and went on to inspire Shelling.

21:03.440 --> 21:07.760
Also, Hegel would have been steeping in all this, and through both Hegel and Shelling,

21:08.640 --> 21:13.440
and also the way the Faurbach had taken up from Hegel's thought within the Young Hegelian movement,

21:15.840 --> 21:20.400
Marx was able to take all these ideas and create dialectical materialism by putting his own spin

21:20.400 --> 21:24.480
on it. So Hegel took all these theoretical developments on the dialectic, and he saw it

21:24.480 --> 21:28.800
to make them practical. That was what that's what the Marxists say. He was the first consciously

21:28.800 --> 21:34.480
to apply the laws of dialectic. And of course, ironically enough, he did this dialectically,

21:34.480 --> 21:39.040
or maybe it's not ironic, maybe it's necessary to how he would approach. He took the abstract,

21:39.040 --> 21:43.440
remember his formulation wasn't thesis and synthesis, although we're going to kind of cling

21:43.440 --> 21:50.400
to that because it's easy to understand his was abstract, negative, concrete. So he took the abstract

21:50.400 --> 21:57.600
form of dialectic put forth by Kant, challenged it against its negative to arrive at a concrete

21:57.600 --> 22:02.400
applicable form that the Marxists recognize he was the first to consciously apply. Apply to what?

22:02.400 --> 22:06.480
To the changing of society. That's what Hegel really did. He figured out how to take this

22:07.280 --> 22:14.720
for Kant. It's really a philosophical endeavor. It's something that's going on in the realm of

22:14.720 --> 22:21.840
philosophy. It's something like what even maybe Socrates written down by Plato would have been

22:21.840 --> 22:26.000
engaging. But it's really an article of philosophy, and it's a very useful one. We even talk about

22:26.000 --> 22:30.400
this positively and how to have impossible conversations. Peter and I do the dialectic

22:30.400 --> 22:36.640
of Hegel and Fichte, we mentioned. But really, it's Kant and Fichte. We really should have taken a

22:36.640 --> 22:42.320
look at this more closely philosophically speaking, because theirs was a philosophical idea where we

22:42.320 --> 22:46.800
can compare ideas against one another and find the flaws and try to figure out what we're missing

22:46.800 --> 22:51.520
and reach a better understanding. And there is a conversational approach that philosophers

22:51.520 --> 22:56.080
frequently use to improve their ideas. You can find that kind of referred to in the Bible under

22:56.080 --> 23:03.200
iron sharpens iron. That's kind of a dialectical process that's abstract. It's a philosophical

23:03.200 --> 23:10.160
endeavor. Well, on the other hand, Hegel had this idea that we're going to use this to create a

23:10.160 --> 23:15.920
better society. We're going to change society using the dialectic by studying the ideas and the

23:15.920 --> 23:21.200
shape of the state and the society itself and the spirit that it generates. So it's not just

23:21.200 --> 23:25.200
philosophical inquiry anymore. He figures out how to apply it. So Hegel brings the laws of

23:25.200 --> 23:29.760
dialectic into the world of application. So the beginning of praxis happens with Hegel.

23:30.400 --> 23:35.840
The dialectical praxis, as it were, Marx goes on to name this after having adopted it and done

23:35.840 --> 23:42.560
a number of things with it that we're going to get to. So central to all of Marxism then is this

23:42.560 --> 23:49.040
dialectic and central to all of the left since Marx is Marxism. So the dialectic flies as the

23:49.040 --> 23:58.400
operating system underwriting everything that's going on with the left over the last, I don't know,

23:58.480 --> 24:08.560
200 years. So taking from marxist.org, we continue the quote Engels and Marx both on this idea.

24:08.560 --> 24:15.440
So Engels wrote, they say in his review of Marx's, the critique of political economy,

24:15.440 --> 24:22.560
this is Engels speaking or writing. The Hegelian method he writes, on the other hand, was in its

24:22.560 --> 24:31.520
existing form quite inapplicable. So for Marx and Engels, who were creating communism, it wasn't

24:31.520 --> 24:39.840
good enough. Even the now applied form of the dialectic is still quite inapplicable because,

24:39.840 --> 24:44.640
as we'll see, he was too mystical. It was essentially idealist. This is back to Engels.

24:45.200 --> 24:50.800
And the main point in this case was the elaboration of a world outlook that was more materialist than

24:50.800 --> 24:57.760
any previous one. Hegel's method took as its point of departure pure thought, whereas here the

24:57.760 --> 25:02.160
starting point was to be inexorable facts. So this is him describing the difference between

25:02.880 --> 25:09.040
Marxist communism versus Hegelian dialectic. We're no longer going to engage in the realm of

25:09.040 --> 25:15.440
pure thought. We're going to move into the realm of inexorable facts. Engels continues,

25:15.440 --> 25:20.000
a method which, according to its own admission, quote, came from nothing through nothing to nothing

25:20.640 --> 25:27.760
he's quoting Hegel in The Science of Logic, part one, section two. He says, this was by no means

25:27.760 --> 25:35.600
appropriate here in this form. Here is to Marxism, to the political economy. Nevertheless,

25:35.600 --> 25:40.960
all of the available logical material, of all the available logical material Engels writes,

25:40.960 --> 25:45.360
it was the only piece which could be used at least as a starting point. So Hegel becomes a

25:45.360 --> 25:51.840
starting point for what Marx wanted to do. It had not been criticized or overcome. Now one of the

25:51.840 --> 25:56.480
opponents of the great dialectician had been able to make a breach in its proud structure. It fell

25:56.480 --> 26:01.280
into oblivion because the Hegelian school had not the slightest notion of what to do with it. The

26:01.280 --> 26:06.720
Hegelian school would be the young Hegelians here. It was therefore above all necessary to subject

26:06.720 --> 26:14.160
the Hegelian method to thoroughgoing criticism. What distinguished Hegel's thought, Engels continues,

26:14.160 --> 26:18.480
from that of all other philosophers, was the tremendous sense of the historical upon which

26:18.480 --> 26:23.920
it was based. Abstract and idealist, though it was in form, yet the development of his thoughts

26:23.920 --> 26:29.680
always proceeded parallel with the development of world history, and the latter is really meant

26:29.680 --> 26:36.960
to be only the test of the former. In other words, Hegel's view was very historicist. He believed

26:36.960 --> 26:41.520
that history had a trajectory, history had a telos, and if you don't understand how history is

26:41.520 --> 26:45.120
moving, you don't really understand what's going on. And the dialectic is actually for Hegel the

26:45.120 --> 26:51.840
thing that is moving history. So Engels continues, if thereby the real relation was inverted and stood

26:51.840 --> 26:57.760
on its head, nevertheless the real content entered everywhere into the philosophy. All the more so

26:57.760 --> 27:05.120
since Hegel, in contrast to his disciples, did not parade ignorance but was one of the finest

27:05.120 --> 27:10.000
intellects of all time. He was the first who attempted to show a development and inner coherence

27:10.000 --> 27:16.080
in history, so this historicism is very important. And while today, much in his philosophy of history

27:16.080 --> 27:21.680
may seem peculiar to us, yet the grandeur of his fundamental outlook is admirable even today,

27:22.560 --> 27:28.000
whether one makes comparison with his predecessors or to be sure with anyone who, since his time,

27:28.000 --> 27:33.840
is indulged in general reflections concerning history. Everywhere in his phenomenology,

27:33.840 --> 27:38.960
aesthetics, history of philosophy, this magnificent conception of history prevails,

27:39.040 --> 27:44.320
and everywhere the material is treated historically in a definite, even if abstractly

27:44.320 --> 27:47.760
distorted, interconnection with history. So when I've said before, by the way, that critical

27:47.760 --> 27:53.200
theories only kind of concentrate themselves, you see this happening here. Engels is talking about

27:53.200 --> 27:58.080
needing, by commenting on Marx, is saying that what we need to do is take Hegel and concentrate

27:58.080 --> 28:02.480
him even further through critique. The critical theory that's emerging will eventually be named

28:02.480 --> 28:07.200
critical theory several decades later, almost a century later, but not quite,

28:08.880 --> 28:12.480
it needs to be concentrated through more and more critique. The dialectic has to be applied

28:12.480 --> 28:18.160
to the dialectic, in a sense. So Engels wraps up by writing this epic-making conception of

28:18.160 --> 28:23.440
history. He's very taken with the historicism of Hegel, which of course is central to Marx's

28:23.440 --> 28:29.360
philosophy as well. And to Marxism, this epic-making conception of history was the direct theoretical

28:29.440 --> 28:34.000
premise for the new materialist outlook, so dialectical materialism that Marx was forwarding.

28:34.000 --> 28:40.960
And this alone, I guess this provides a typo, this alone provides a connecting point for the

28:40.960 --> 28:48.000
logical method too. Since this forgotten dialectics has led to such results, even from the standpoint

28:48.000 --> 28:52.640
of pure thinking and had in addition so easily settled accounts with all preceding logic and

28:52.640 --> 28:57.760
metaphysics, there must be at any rate, there must at any rate have been more to it than sophistry

28:57.760 --> 29:02.000
and hair splitting, which of course Schopenhauer would have viciously criticized it as just a

29:02.000 --> 29:08.000
bunch of sophistry, because it is. But the criticism of his method Engel finally writes,

29:08.000 --> 29:14.000
with all of its official philosophy, had thought shy of and still does, was no trifle.

29:15.440 --> 29:19.680
He's a big fan of the historicism. He thinks that Hegel brought forth very important ideas.

29:20.400 --> 29:24.720
The dialectic is a very important one, but it wasn't correct in its formulation. He says

29:24.720 --> 29:28.160
something about if it's standing on its head, it's going to have to be righted. Of course,

29:30.080 --> 29:35.280
that's exactly what Marx had written. Marx later wrote, in fact, as this is still quoting from

29:35.280 --> 29:40.720
marxist.org, in his preface to the second edition of Capital Volume 1, Marx writes,

29:40.720 --> 29:47.760
my dialectic method is not only different from the Hegelian, but is its direct opposite. So abstract

29:47.760 --> 29:56.640
meets negative. Right. To Hegel, the life process of the human brain, i.e. the process of thinking,

29:56.640 --> 30:01.600
which under the name of the idea, he even transforms into an independent subject,

30:01.600 --> 30:08.400
is the demiurgeous of the real world. And the real world is only the external phenomenal form of the

30:08.400 --> 30:14.640
idea. So just to summarize what that means, for Hegel, there's the idea, which is what's going

30:14.640 --> 30:19.600
on for real, because he's an idealist, and then the world becomes an image of the idea.

30:21.120 --> 30:25.600
And so Marx is like, that's upside down. What we have to actually look at is we have to look at

30:25.600 --> 30:31.200
the real world and go from there. So he writes, with me, on the contrary, the ideal is nothing

30:31.200 --> 30:36.640
else than the material world reflected by the human mind and translated into forms of thought.

30:36.640 --> 30:42.720
Marx is probably right on this. The mystification which dialectic suffers in Hegel's hands by no

30:42.720 --> 30:48.400
means prevents him from being the first to present its general form of working in a comprehensive

30:48.400 --> 30:53.280
and conscious manner. With him, it is standing on its head. It must be turned right side up again

30:53.280 --> 30:58.400
if you would discover the rational kernel within the mystical shell. And so the dialectic becomes

30:58.400 --> 31:03.360
obviously central, but the Marxists are not happy. Marx and Engels, specifically not the Marxists,

31:03.360 --> 31:09.200
are not happy with how it's been formulated. They say that by focusing on the ideal rather than

31:09.200 --> 31:14.480
the material, they get it upside down. Of course, as I pointed out, we see the structure of Hegel's

31:14.480 --> 31:19.040
dialectic being applied to Hegel's dialectic, where Hegel's dialectic is framed as the abstract,

31:19.040 --> 31:24.480
just as Hegel did to Kant's formulation of the dialectic. And now it has to be made

31:24.480 --> 31:31.920
more material. It's negation. It has to mean it's negative, which is where Marx says,

31:31.920 --> 31:38.720
with me on the contrary, it's exactly the opposite. So we have abstract meaning negation,

31:38.720 --> 31:42.960
and so the concrete that's going to come out of this is going to be dialectical materialism for

31:42.960 --> 31:51.360
Marx. And so we see the dialectic turning on the dialectic and creating a new view that's supposed

31:51.360 --> 31:56.240
to be the progression of history. And this is being reflected and it's being written and shared.

31:56.240 --> 32:04.800
This is the entry for Hegel on today's marxist.org website. So jumping entries to give you more

32:04.800 --> 32:08.160
insight, we got to understand the dialectic. That's the goal right now because I want you

32:08.160 --> 32:12.480
to understand that the dialectic has been the operating system of the left. It has been central

32:12.480 --> 32:17.040
to Engel, central to Marx, central to Hegel. Fauerbach was the one who tutored Marx and

32:17.040 --> 32:22.320
made him materialist in the first place as a Young Hegelian. So we've got this Hegel to Young

32:22.320 --> 32:28.480
Hegelian to Marx chain, where the dialectic is evolving through dialectical means. The operating

32:28.480 --> 32:34.080
system is so central to the left's thought that the operating system of the left is operating on

32:34.080 --> 32:40.400
itself to evolve itself. So we now have Hegel having applied the dialectic to Kant's dialectic,

32:40.400 --> 32:45.760
and we have Marx and Engel's applying the dialectic to Hegel's dialectic to receive,

32:47.280 --> 32:51.760
to get to dialectical materialism, which is the essence of Marxism. And so here we have,

32:51.760 --> 32:57.920
as we read in the Critical Race Three book, and so the dialectic progresses. I told you there's a

32:57.920 --> 33:03.040
very important little sentence that you wouldn't normally care about when you read that. So now

33:03.120 --> 33:08.000
to go into the dialectic entry itself on Marxist.org, what did they write? They write,

33:08.000 --> 33:13.200
it was Hegel who was able to sum up this picture of universal interconnection and mutability of

33:13.200 --> 33:18.800
things in a system of logic, which is the foundation of what we today call dialectics.

33:19.600 --> 33:24.640
As Engels put it, so they quote Engels here, quote, the whole world, natural historical

33:24.640 --> 33:30.080
intellectual, is represented as a process, that is, as in constant motion change,

33:30.080 --> 33:34.800
transformation, development. And the attempt is made to trace out the internal connection

33:35.360 --> 33:38.960
that makes a continuous whole of all of this movement and development.

33:41.600 --> 33:48.080
They go on to write, this is Marxist.org again, that's the end of how Engels put it. It was in the

33:48.080 --> 33:53.440
decade after Hegel's death in the 1840s, when Hegel's popularity was at its peak in Germany,

33:53.440 --> 33:57.520
then Marx and Engels met and worked out the foundations of their critique of bourgeois

33:57.520 --> 34:04.400
society. Hegel's radical young followers, there's our young Hegelians, had in their hands a powerful

34:04.400 --> 34:10.560
critical tool, the dialectic, with which they ruthlessly criticized Christianity, the dominant

34:10.560 --> 34:14.240
doctrine of the day. This is, we'll see something that Hegel was actually interested in as well.

34:14.240 --> 34:21.040
He wanted to reestablish a Fulcish German religion that escaped the Orientalism of Christianity,

34:21.040 --> 34:26.880
which he felt had been foisted upon Germany, kind of inappropriately. Well, the young Hegelians

34:26.880 --> 34:31.200
really felt this way, and they ruthlessly criticized Christianity using the dialectic.

34:32.160 --> 34:37.920
So, to carry on, however, one of these young Hegelians, Ludwig Faurbach, pointed out that

34:38.480 --> 34:42.560
the Holy Family was after all only a heavenly image of the earthly family,

34:43.520 --> 34:47.200
and said that by criticizing theology with philosophy the young Hegelians were only doing

34:47.200 --> 34:52.800
the same as the Christians. Hegel's absolute idea was just another name for God. For Faurbach,

34:52.800 --> 34:58.080
ideas were a reflection of the material world, and he held it to be ridiculous that an idea could

34:58.080 --> 35:04.640
determine the world. Faurbach had declared himself a materialist. Marx and Engels began as supporters

35:04.640 --> 35:10.720
of Faurbach. However, very soon they took up an opposition to Faurbach to restore the Hegelian

35:10.720 --> 35:15.760
dialectic which had been abandoned by Faurbach. Remember, this is Marxist.org summarizing the

35:15.760 --> 35:21.280
history of the dialectic for us here, and to free it from the rigidity of the idealistic Hegelian

35:21.280 --> 35:26.720
system in place to method on a materialist basis. So, you see, it is the dialectic being applied to

35:26.720 --> 35:35.600
the dialectic itself. Kind of amazing. So, Hegel, they quote, was an idealist to him. The thoughts

35:35.600 --> 35:41.920
within his brain were not the more or less abstract pictures of actual things and processes, but

35:41.920 --> 35:47.440
conversely, the things in their evolution were only the realized pictures of the idea,

35:48.080 --> 35:53.120
existing somewhere from eternity before the world was. This way of thinking turned everything

35:53.120 --> 35:56.720
upside down and completely reversed the actual connection of things in the world.

35:57.680 --> 36:02.480
Thus, for Marx and Engels, thoughts were not passive and independent reflections of the material

36:02.480 --> 36:07.920
world, we're still reading from Marxist.org by the way, but products of human labor,

36:07.920 --> 36:12.720
and the contradictory nature of our thoughts had their origin in the contradictions within human

36:12.720 --> 36:18.560
society. This meant that dialectics was not something imposed on to the world from outside,

36:18.560 --> 36:22.880
which could be discovered by the activity of pure reason, but was a product of human labor

36:22.880 --> 36:28.080
changing the world. Its form was changed and developed by people, and could only be understood

36:28.080 --> 36:32.560
by the practical struggle to overcome these contradictions, not just in thought, but in

36:32.560 --> 36:38.960
practice. So, again, I make the claim, Hegel puts forth this dialectic, which he has

36:38.960 --> 36:48.000
dialectically derived from Kant, and via the vehicle of the Young Hegelians, we now have

36:48.640 --> 36:54.800
Marx and Engels trying to turn this materialist, and they actually are in fact dropping in a

36:54.800 --> 36:59.760
dialectic on the dialectic again, and transforming it into something else. And the thing that comes

36:59.760 --> 37:06.160
out of this is the dialectical materialism, which Marx said stands Hegel on his head. So,

37:06.160 --> 37:11.040
I think we have now firmly established the line of the dialectic from Hegel to the Young

37:11.040 --> 37:16.800
Hegelians to Marx and Marxism, and the Marxists themselves obviously still support this because

37:16.800 --> 37:22.720
they write about this in this particular way on their website today. So, this I think line has

37:22.720 --> 37:29.920
been that the operating system of the left up from Hegel to Marx is dialectic, and it in fact takes

37:29.920 --> 37:35.440
the dialectic to concentrate the dialectic into a form that becomes Marxism, which is the dialectically

37:35.440 --> 37:40.720
enhanced dialectic. So, the operating system is almost reflexive in the sense that it concentrates

37:40.720 --> 37:44.960
itself, and this is where Marxism comes from. And again, it has to be stressed that the entire

37:44.960 --> 37:49.760
operating system of the left from the 1840s and 50s, when Marx and Engels start writing this stuff

37:49.760 --> 37:55.120
down, Marxism starts to become a thing, especially following the Russian Revolution in 1917, the

37:55.120 --> 38:02.400
entire operating system of the left really becomes Marxist up through probably the 1960s,

38:03.280 --> 38:09.120
when finally the failures of communism become undeniable, when finally Khrushchev comes out

38:09.120 --> 38:19.520
and speaks and reveals as the premier of the Soviet Union how horrible Stalin's regime was,

38:19.520 --> 38:25.280
how opposite to what people claimed it was, what Stalin claimed it was, what Walter Duranty at the

38:25.280 --> 38:29.680
New York Times claimed it was, the propagandist at the Pulitzer Prize, kind of like Nikol Hanna

38:29.680 --> 38:36.080
Jones today. So, I think we've established that far. Well, it turns out that this, even though we

38:36.080 --> 38:41.280
have this kind of disillusionment with Marxism in the 1920s, we have this frustration among many

38:41.280 --> 38:46.160
communists that the Russian Revolution worked, many Marxists, but no other revolutions are working,

38:46.160 --> 38:50.560
the Hungarian Revolution failed, no other revolutions are sparking, Marx's prediction

38:50.560 --> 38:55.360
that they would happen in big industrial centers like London and New York and Los Angeles and

38:55.360 --> 39:00.720
Chicago and Berlin isn't coming to pass. It's only in BFE peasant Russia that it's happened.

39:00.720 --> 39:05.600
It tried in Hungary, but Hungary couldn't do it. Something is wrong and the Neo-Marxists come up

39:05.600 --> 39:10.480
with a new theory. Well, the Neo-Marxists are very interested in the dialectic and they in fact make

39:10.480 --> 39:14.320
it central to the project. They name it all the time. They talk about all the time titles of their

39:14.320 --> 39:21.120
books include, for example, the dialectic of enlightenment. Critical theory is in fact the

39:21.120 --> 39:26.560
application of the precise dialectic that's now been dialectically moved again from where Marx was.

39:26.560 --> 39:32.800
In fact, it's been said that the critical theorists turned, where Marx said that Hegel was standing

39:32.800 --> 39:37.760
on his head, they put Hegel back up right because Marx is actually the one who turned him upside

39:37.760 --> 39:41.760
down by making it too materialist and not realistic enough to help people actually operate.

39:43.040 --> 39:47.920
They didn't take it back to the idea as Hegel did. They took it into the realm of culture.

39:47.920 --> 39:51.680
That's why they're often called cultural Marxists, but it'd be more accurate, I think,

39:51.680 --> 39:59.440
to call them cultural Hegelians. But at any rate, or dialectical culturalists or something,

39:59.440 --> 40:04.880
cultural dialecticists or something like this. So they're not applying it in the Kantian sense

40:04.880 --> 40:10.720
that's been dialecticized into the Hegelian sense. They're not applying it in the strict Hegelian

40:10.720 --> 40:17.280
sense that's been dialecticized into dialectical materialism and Marxism, and they no longer

40:17.280 --> 40:20.960
believe in that. And so they're now criticizing that. They're bringing the critique to Marxism

40:21.520 --> 40:26.160
itself, and they're putting it into the realm of culture. And by doing so, they're now doing it in

40:26.160 --> 40:31.520
this new way where the dialectic has applied to the dialectic repeatedly to come up with this new

40:31.520 --> 40:35.760
thing. But they're also becoming much more politically activated, again, like the young

40:35.760 --> 40:41.680
Hegelians were. And so they're kind of dipping back to when Marx was his most young Hegelian in his

40:41.680 --> 40:47.120
very early writings. Some neo-Marxist critiques suggest that Marx lost his way while writing

40:47.120 --> 40:55.280
Kapital. Communist Manifesto was better. But by the time he's getting in his early letters are best,

40:55.280 --> 41:00.240
and when he started getting into writing things like Kapital, he was already kind of off his

41:00.240 --> 41:05.760
rocker. He'd gone too far smelling his own farts, if you will, and they got it wrong. So they wanted

41:05.760 --> 41:09.840
to put this Hegel back into Marx, but without making the same mistakes where Marx had already,

41:09.840 --> 41:14.320
to them, rightly critiqued Hegel. So this was kind of one of their big projects. Of course,

41:14.320 --> 41:18.240
they also wanted to work Freud in, also wanted to work social science in, and some other things.

41:19.280 --> 41:24.400
But they also wanted to figure out how to attack culture, specifically having decided,

41:24.400 --> 41:32.960
following people like Gramsci, following people like George Lucca, that culture somehow upholds

41:34.480 --> 41:40.080
society and prevents these revolutions to the end of history, to the utopia, to communism, really.

41:40.640 --> 41:45.040
And so it's a very politically activated sense for the Neo-Marxists in a very different way.

41:45.840 --> 41:50.240
But again, we're seeing, my case that I'm trying to make is this is a fundamental operating system

41:50.240 --> 41:56.880
of leftism. It's what's driving their vehicle. It's what makes their computer work, if you want to

41:56.880 --> 42:00.800
stick with operating system metaphor, I guess. This is how the left thinks. It's how it moves.

42:00.800 --> 42:04.560
It's how it achieves its goals. And so it must be understood if you want to understand what's

42:04.640 --> 42:10.640
happening in the world today with this blossoming of absolutely insane woke leftism, which I'm

42:10.640 --> 42:15.520
telling you is the last, the most recent manifestation, I should say, hopefully the last, but the most

42:15.520 --> 42:21.120
recent manifestation of this crappy line of thought, this crappy religion, as it's come down for the

42:21.120 --> 42:26.640
last 200 years, ultimately from the metaphysics of Hegel, which we'll get to a bit further down.

42:26.640 --> 42:32.000
So to convince you just how central the dialectic is to the process of the Neo-Marxists and to show

42:32.000 --> 42:36.400
you how they use it, I'm going to quote a number of examples from them. So Max Horkheimer,

42:37.360 --> 42:43.840
the first chair of the Frankfurt School, the Institute for Social Research,

42:45.440 --> 42:49.040
writes in traditional and critical theory where the idea of critical theory is defined for the

42:49.040 --> 42:54.480
first time. He writes in the following pages, this is actually in a footnote, this activity,

42:54.480 --> 42:59.200
which is what he's talking about in terms of his methodology, critical theory, the following pages,

42:59.280 --> 43:03.200
this activity is called critical activity. This actually comes from Marx, by the way,

43:03.200 --> 43:07.200
he didn't make up this term. You could go all the way back to the critique of pure reason or whatever

43:07.200 --> 43:12.320
you want to do with Kant, whatever you want to say, but the point is actually that Marx had

43:12.320 --> 43:17.040
developed something he called the critical philosophy and the critical activity comes out

43:17.040 --> 43:20.720
of the critical philosophy and for Marx that meant the ruthless criticism of everything that exists,

43:21.840 --> 43:28.160
largely in order to tear it down and make room for his own vision that he was imagining into the

43:28.160 --> 43:33.040
world. So Horkheimer's written in the following pages, this activity is called critical activity,

43:33.040 --> 43:38.720
the term is used here less in the sense it has in the idealist critique of pure reason, so not

43:38.720 --> 43:44.480
Kant, than in the sense that it has in the dialectical critique of political economy, so Hegel.

43:45.120 --> 43:49.840
In particular, though, political economy was that phrase we saw from Marx describing political

43:49.840 --> 43:54.640
economy that Engels was commenting on when I read from earlier. So we're talking about Hegel

43:54.640 --> 44:00.080
through Marx, it points to an essential aspect of the dialectical theory of society, Horkheimer

44:00.080 --> 44:09.600
concludes. So Horkheimer, you know, first leader of the Frankfurt School, the Institute for Social

44:09.600 --> 44:14.560
Research at Goethe University, that is really where critical theory comes from, it was developed,

44:14.560 --> 44:21.920
this is the seat of neo-Marxism. This actually arose when he, Horkheimer, I mean, in conversation

44:21.920 --> 44:29.120
with some others envisioned the idea of creating for the critical left a great analysis and eventually

44:29.120 --> 44:37.680
book on the dialectic that would restore something of Hegel from Marx and Marx's failures were critical

44:37.680 --> 44:41.840
to understanding the tasks, we had to criticize Marx, we have to do the dialectic to Marx's

44:41.840 --> 44:48.880
dialectically derived dialectical materialism, which was derived from Hegel's dialectic at this

44:48.880 --> 44:55.280
point. And so he produces eventually 1944-1947, this book that I mentioned a minute ago with Theodore

44:55.280 --> 45:00.240
Adorno, another major neo-Marxist called The Dialectic of Enlightenment, which is considered to be the

45:01.040 --> 45:05.520
real comprehensive treatment of critical theory, or in other words, the first real statement of

45:05.520 --> 45:10.080
neo-Marxism and what neo-Marxism about, the whole book is titled The Dialectic of Enlightenment,

45:10.080 --> 45:14.400
where they're trying to explain that the Enlightenment unleashes its own dialectic that turns

45:14.400 --> 45:21.760
reason into unreason, it turns rationality into irrationality. So I'll read a little bit

45:21.760 --> 45:28.160
around and from this book, in The Dialectic of Enlightenment, Horkheimer and Adorno make the

45:28.160 --> 45:33.600
case in the words of one of its, the editor of one of its editions, a philosophical fragments

45:33.600 --> 45:38.160
edition, which happens to be one that I have, the editor's name is Gunslyn Noor, if I'm pronouncing

45:38.160 --> 45:43.440
that right, or it's an afterward where he describes what's going on with The Dialectic of Enlightenment,

45:43.440 --> 45:49.040
and he writes, the self-destruction of Western reason is seen to be grounded in an historical

45:49.040 --> 45:55.600
and fateful dialectic of the domination of external nature, internal nature, and society.

45:55.600 --> 46:00.640
Enlightenment, which split these spheres apart, is traced back to its mythical roots.

46:01.280 --> 46:06.720
Enlightenment and myth are not seen therefore as irreconcilable opposites, but as dialectically

46:06.720 --> 46:13.840
mediated qualities of both real and intellectual life. As they write in the book, myth is already

46:13.840 --> 46:19.680
Enlightenment and Enlightenment reverts to mythology. This paradox is the fundamental thesis

46:19.680 --> 46:27.280
of the book, meaning dialectic of Enlightenment. Reason, Noor writes, reason appears as inextricably

46:27.280 --> 46:32.640
entangled with domination. Since the beginnings of history, liberation from the compulsions of

46:32.640 --> 46:39.600
external nature has been achieved only by introducing a power relationship of second degree.

46:41.920 --> 46:45.920
Both the repression of the internal nature of human drives, that was very important to

46:45.920 --> 46:51.840
Markuza in particular, and social domination are already at work in myth. Finally, fascism in the

46:51.840 --> 46:57.760
modern culture industry are the forms taken by a return of repressed nature, so you can hear the

46:57.760 --> 47:02.720
Freudian aspects being worked in as well. In the service of an advancing rationalization of

47:02.720 --> 47:08.000
instrumental thought modeled on the domination of nature and serving its purposes, enlightened

47:08.000 --> 47:13.200
reason is progressively hollowed out until it reverts to the new mythology of a resurrected

47:13.200 --> 47:19.360
relationship to nature, to violence. This is what the dialectic of Enlightenment is arguing,

47:19.360 --> 47:23.600
that's what the editor is writing here. This theme he writes is summed up in the opening

47:23.600 --> 47:28.560
sentences of the book. Enlightenment understood in the widest sense as the advance of thought has

47:28.560 --> 47:33.360
always aimed at liberating human beings from fear and installing them as masters, yet the whole

47:33.360 --> 47:40.560
enlightened earth is radiant with triumphant calamity. So he's saying that the Enlightenment

47:40.560 --> 47:46.640
has devolved into domination. Reason has become a tool of domination. You can see the precursors

47:46.640 --> 47:52.160
that postmodernism is going to be thinking similar things already here in 44 and 47 from these guys

47:52.160 --> 48:01.120
and these Neo-Marsists. I guess you could say that this book culminates very near the end

48:01.680 --> 48:07.600
and kind of a cheerless proclamation is his statement of thesis really. In the progress of

48:07.600 --> 48:12.480
industrial society, which is supposed to have conjured away the law of increasing misery,

48:12.480 --> 48:18.080
it had itself brought into being the concept would justify the whole, the human being as a person,

48:18.080 --> 48:22.800
as a bearer of reason is going under. The dialectic of Enlightenment is culminating

48:22.800 --> 48:29.280
objectively in madness. So rationality becomes irrationality by the dialectic of Enlightenment.

48:29.280 --> 48:32.800
And of course, that's where you're going to have a thesis meeting its antithesis,

48:32.800 --> 48:38.000
rationality is becoming irrationality. And so a synthesis that escapes this is what's going to

48:38.000 --> 48:42.400
be needed. And that's really what they're calling for in critical theory is framed as the tool to

48:42.400 --> 48:46.720
do it. That's the purpose of this book, dialectic of Enlightenment. So the Neo-Marsists are completely

48:46.720 --> 48:54.160
on board with the concept of dialectic. Again, the Neo-Marsists are going to become the things

48:54.160 --> 48:58.080
that lead up to Herbert Marcuse. Herbert Marcuse is going to become the father of the new left,

48:58.080 --> 49:02.960
which is supposed to take over where the old left, which is the Marxists left off. And we already

49:02.960 --> 49:08.560
see this trajectory of relying still on that operating system of the dialectic. And so when

49:08.560 --> 49:13.360
we turn to Marcuse, it's no surprise that we see him talking about the dialectic all the time.

49:13.360 --> 49:17.840
When we read, for example, Herbert Marcuse in One Dimensional Man, which he wrote in 1964,

49:17.840 --> 49:24.240
this being his most popular and famous book sold 300 plus thousand copies in the first year

49:24.240 --> 49:28.880
from what I understand. So we're talking about an absolute intellectual rock star,

49:28.880 --> 49:33.120
absolutely hugely influential. This laid the groundwork for the new, for the new left that

49:33.120 --> 49:39.280
emerged during the Vietnam War into a new era and started with hippies and civil rights and

49:39.360 --> 49:43.920
turned into eventually what we're dealing with today in the woke. And what Marcuse writes in

49:43.920 --> 49:50.000
One Dimensional Man writing in 1964 is dialectical thought understands the critical tension between

49:50.000 --> 49:55.680
is and ought, first as an ontological condition pertaining to the structure of being itself.

49:55.680 --> 50:01.840
However, the recognition of this state of being, its theory, extends from the beginning a concrete

50:01.840 --> 50:06.160
practice, intends from the beginning a concrete practice. So what he's saying is that we have

50:06.160 --> 50:12.320
to understand through the analysis the critical tension between is and ought, between what is,

50:12.320 --> 50:17.440
what the world actually is, and what it ought to be. That's that normative vision of a perfected

50:17.440 --> 50:23.680
society. And this is something very important. Dialectical thought takes this as an ontological

50:23.680 --> 50:28.560
condition that pertains to the structure of being itself. That's what he says. However,

50:29.280 --> 50:33.520
he writes, the recognition of this state of being, its theory, intends from the beginning

50:33.520 --> 50:38.800
a concrete practice. So you see this language of Hegel. We have the abstract meaning the negative,

50:38.800 --> 50:44.640
and it's negative, and resulting in a concrete practice. In other words, activism that's going

50:44.640 --> 50:50.720
to lead us to this new multi-dimensional, for him, two-dimensional analysis that's going to use

50:50.720 --> 50:56.240
critical theory in particular to achieve what it's trying to do. It's going to have is and ought,

50:56.240 --> 51:03.760
not just is as its analytical mode, two-dimensional, not one-dimensional. There's more to the

51:03.760 --> 51:09.520
one-dimensional metaphor, but we'll leave it at that. So this dialectical thing is the essence

51:09.520 --> 51:17.440
of critical theory. And so even from, we had up to Marx, no question, he called his project

51:17.440 --> 51:22.560
the dialectical materialism, right? So up to Marx, there's no question that the dialectic of Hegel,

51:22.640 --> 51:26.960
derived from Hegel, I should say, through the dialectical process itself, is the operating system

51:26.960 --> 51:31.680
of the old left. Well, with Markuza, we have the birth of the new left, and that also is going to

51:31.680 --> 51:36.560
rely upon this dialectic. He mentions the dialectic repeatedly in all of his works. So with Markuza

51:36.560 --> 51:41.200
pushing it this way, it's no longer just going to be central to the old left and whatever remnant

51:41.200 --> 51:46.240
goes forward out of the death of the falling of the various communist regimes, the horrors of

51:46.240 --> 51:51.680
communism, crisis of faith and communism that arose from most, but not all Marxists at the time.

51:51.680 --> 51:55.040
So not only the remnant of the old left and all of the old left leading back to

51:56.480 --> 52:02.560
the old Marxists, but also to the new left that arose in its wake, largely starting in the years

52:02.560 --> 52:08.320
leading up to and then launching off during the Vietnam War. So what does this look like in practice?

52:08.320 --> 52:13.200
What does this dialectic of the new left look like in practice? So we turn back to Markuza.

52:14.160 --> 52:18.000
You can look at this a couple of examples from Markuza's writing again in One-Dimensional Man.

52:18.000 --> 52:24.720
He writes, the laws of thought are laws of reality or rather become the laws of reality

52:24.720 --> 52:29.200
if thought understands the truth of immediate experience as the appearance of another truth,

52:30.080 --> 52:37.280
which is that of the true forms of reality of the ideas. Thus there is contradiction rather

52:37.280 --> 52:42.160
than correspondence between the dialectical thought and the given reality. The true judgment

52:42.160 --> 52:47.600
judges this reality not on its own terms, but in terms which envision its subversion,

52:47.600 --> 52:53.920
and in this subversion reality comes into its own truth. So Markuza is recommending a very subversive

52:53.920 --> 52:58.880
approach and application. The dialectic becomes a subversive activity. It's something that we're

52:58.880 --> 53:03.440
going to get in and we're going to get inside and do kind of undermining that which exists

53:03.440 --> 53:10.480
by confronting that which is with its negations. And so thesis is going to meet antithesis in a

53:10.560 --> 53:16.160
subversive way and it's going to force us to look for, probably force us to look for some

53:16.160 --> 53:20.480
synthesis or at least to tear. Remember earlier when we read from the essay on liberation,

53:20.480 --> 53:25.520
it's going to force us to start tearing away the constructs of current society so the seed of the

53:25.520 --> 53:30.400
perfect society can blossom. This is Markusian thought at this point and it requires that

53:30.400 --> 53:35.600
multi-dimensional or two-dimensional at least thought that he's speaking about in One-Dimensional

53:35.600 --> 53:42.000
Man. So we can turn to more concrete examples of this in practice from Markuza because Markuza

53:42.000 --> 53:48.320
is really paradigmatic of the post-war, post-war war two I should say, critical theory school that

53:48.320 --> 53:55.040
inspired the black feminists who we'll talk about momentarily, kind of the second generation

53:55.040 --> 54:02.160
critical theory that then becomes the roadmap to developing the woke that we live in today.

54:02.160 --> 54:05.840
So in Repressive Tolerance, which I've read in full in another podcast,

54:05.840 --> 54:09.920
four episodes, Herbert Markuza writes, according to a dialectical proposition,

54:10.560 --> 54:15.440
it is the whole which determines the truth. So again, we're seeing this Hegelian idea that

54:17.120 --> 54:21.200
the whole is you have to understand the whole to understand the particulars. This is a kind of

54:21.200 --> 54:28.720
Hegelian metaphysical axiom and the dialectic is how you're going to approach doing this. Again,

54:28.720 --> 54:31.840
we're talking about this being the operating system of leftism. So we're looking at new

54:31.920 --> 54:36.240
leftism, its emergence from Markuza here in Repressive Tolerance. It says this is not in

54:36.240 --> 54:41.040
the sense that the whole is prior or superior to its parts, but in the sense that its structure

54:41.040 --> 54:46.080
and function determine every particular condition and relation. This is pure Hegelianism. You can't

54:46.080 --> 54:50.480
understand the particulars without understanding the whole. So the whole is the thing you're trying to

54:51.040 --> 54:56.400
extract from the particulars is the same idea of peeling away the problems of society so that the

54:57.360 --> 55:02.800
the utopian society can emerge so that the seed of the perfect society can blossom, if you will,

55:02.800 --> 55:09.040
or bloom. So he writes, thus within a repressive society, even progressive movements threaten

55:09.040 --> 55:15.200
to turn into their opposite to the degree to which they accept the rules of the game. Generally,

55:15.200 --> 55:19.760
the function and value of tolerance depend on the equality prevalent in the society in which

55:19.760 --> 55:25.440
tolerance is practiced. Tolerance itself stands subject to overriding criteria. Its range and

55:25.520 --> 55:29.440
its limits cannot be defined in terms of the respective society. So really what he's arguing

55:29.440 --> 55:33.600
for in Repressive Tolerance is the dialectical treatment of tolerance, where tolerance is going

55:33.600 --> 55:40.320
to be turned into intolerance. Tolerance is going to meet intolerance, thesis meets

55:40.320 --> 55:44.800
antithesis into the synthesis is going to be a repressive tolerance or what he calls a discriminating

55:44.800 --> 55:50.720
tolerance or a liberating tolerance. Tolerance is not actually tolerant at all, but that's going

55:50.720 --> 55:59.440
to lead us toward a new and better liberated future. So thesis is tolerance, antithesis is

55:59.440 --> 56:05.280
intolerance, synthesis is repressive tolerance, or this discriminating, liberating tolerance.

56:05.280 --> 56:12.080
And so now tolerance gets the dialectic applied to it, and now you get this totally tilted playing

56:12.080 --> 56:17.120
field that I said is the logic of the world we live in today, the logic of the left is repressive

56:17.200 --> 56:21.680
tolerance, which ultimately its basic thesis is that conservatives must be censored. In fact,

56:21.680 --> 56:24.880
they must be pre-censored. It's not enough that they lose their freedom of speech. They have to

56:24.880 --> 56:29.920
lose the freedom to even think the thought by having their ideas pre-censored before they

56:29.920 --> 56:33.200
can even enter their minds. So you're not talking just about the freedom of speech,

56:33.200 --> 56:37.040
talking about cognitive liberty being put under threat by repressive tolerance.

56:37.040 --> 56:40.960
And this is the product of, again, the point that I'm trying to make is that in the Neo-Marxist

56:40.960 --> 56:46.560
era, we're here in the 1965 for this essay, in the Neo-Marxist era, we are now talking about

56:46.560 --> 56:50.640
the dialectic being still central. It's still the operating system. We're doing the dialectic

56:50.640 --> 56:54.880
on the dialectic. We're doing the dialectic on tolerance. We're doing the dialectic on other

56:54.880 --> 57:01.120
ideas. We'll see in a second, democratic forms are going to be pulled into this. And so the

57:01.120 --> 57:05.200
dialectic is still the operating system of everything that's going on through the left.

57:05.200 --> 57:10.640
The old left had it. The new left is adopting it. So in his essay on liberation from 1969,

57:10.640 --> 57:15.840
Marcuse writes dialectics of democracy. That's the heading, right? The dialectics of democracy.

57:15.840 --> 57:20.720
This is how dialectics apply in democracy. If democracy, he writes, means self-government to

57:20.720 --> 57:25.360
free people with justice for all, then the realization of democracy would presuppose

57:25.360 --> 57:30.640
abolition of the existing pseudo-democracy. So we have thesis. We live in a democracy,

57:30.640 --> 57:37.200
or we want democracy. Thesis. This is the democracy. Antithesis. It's a pseudo-democracy

57:37.200 --> 57:44.560
because there are actually systems of power, right? There are systems of power with justice for

57:44.560 --> 57:49.120
all. Well, not everybody's getting justice. So we don't live in a democracy, thesis. We live in a

57:50.080 --> 57:54.480
pseudo-democracy, antithesis. So we're going to need a synthesis of this. And he writes,

57:54.480 --> 57:58.640
in the dynamic of corporate capitalism, this is where he's describing the pseudo-democracy, I think,

57:58.640 --> 58:03.920
the fight for democracy thus tends to assume anti-democratic forms and to the extent to which

58:03.920 --> 58:08.240
the democratic decisions are made in parliaments on all levels, the opposition will tend to become

58:08.240 --> 58:13.280
extra-parliamentary. The movement to extend constitutionally professed rights and liberties

58:13.280 --> 58:18.080
to the daily life of the oppressed minorities, even the movement to preserve existing rights

58:18.080 --> 58:23.040
and liberties will become subversive to the degree to which it will meet the stiffening

58:23.040 --> 58:27.840
resistance of the majority against an exaggerated interpretation and application of equality

58:27.840 --> 58:32.160
and justice. This is very similar to what we're seeing today. This logic is playing out exactly

58:32.160 --> 58:38.560
right now under these so-called equity and racial and other social justice movements.

58:38.560 --> 58:44.720
So what do we have here? Democracy is the thesis. Thesis-democracy, antithesis. Pseudo-democracy,

58:44.720 --> 58:48.640
because of systemic power dynamics, the synthesis is going to be what Marcuse

58:48.640 --> 58:54.160
elsewhere calls ideal democracy. The communists also refer to ideal democracy. If you don't know,

58:54.160 --> 58:59.920
the communists position themselves as ideal democracy because, for them, if everybody's

58:59.920 --> 59:03.760
not perfectly equal, if everybody's not got exactly the same amount of money, everybody's

59:03.760 --> 59:07.680
got not exactly the same amount of opportunity, exactly the same amount of access, you can have

59:07.680 --> 59:11.200
true democracy because certain people aren't going to be able to speak up as much. They're not

59:11.200 --> 59:14.400
going to be able to get to the polls as readily. They're not going to have the same ability

59:15.280 --> 59:20.800
to participate or the same access. So it's not a true democracy until there's perfect equity.

59:21.840 --> 59:27.520
And so you can actually see here how they subvert language, right? The word democracy

59:27.520 --> 59:31.520
meets this argument that we're going to call its antithesis. We know it's really a pseudo

59:31.520 --> 59:35.680
democracy because there's systemic power. And so we have the synthesis of an ideal democracy,

59:35.680 --> 59:39.680
which has an adjective in front of it, but the adjective gets dropped so that when these people

59:39.680 --> 59:46.080
speak of democracy, they later or tolerance, they will later mean not liberating or discriminating

59:46.080 --> 59:49.920
tolerance necessarily, or sorry, not regular tolerance, but liberating or discriminating

59:49.920 --> 59:53.360
tolerance. And you won't actually know which one for sure. And here we have the word democracy

59:53.360 --> 59:58.400
being subverted into this ideal democracy, which presupposes that we're in a communist-like

59:58.400 --> 01:00:03.600
situation before it counts. And this is how their language games are constructed.

01:00:03.600 --> 01:00:08.480
If you want to understand why they have so much doublespeak, this is where it comes from.

01:00:08.480 --> 01:00:13.600
But again, my point so far, I'm dropping a lot of extra nuggets, point so far is to convince

01:00:13.600 --> 01:00:20.160
you, and I think I have done so, that indeed the neo-Marxists are certainly going to have been tied

01:00:20.160 --> 01:00:24.800
up with this idea of the dialectic. And the dialectic is being applied to the dialectic again,

01:00:24.800 --> 01:00:31.360
and it's kind of a reflexive pattern that concentrates it. And so through, we got Hegel now,

01:00:31.360 --> 01:00:36.320
leading into the young Hegelians, and the young Hegelians leading into Marx, and the Marx leading

01:00:36.320 --> 01:00:41.360
into the Marxists, and the Marxists leading into like including Lenin, and the Marxists leading

01:00:41.360 --> 01:00:45.760
into the neo-Marxists. And the constant thread is still in this dialectical engine, which even

01:00:45.760 --> 01:00:52.960
gets applied to itself to create its new iteration. So the overarching project, or the underlying

01:00:52.960 --> 01:00:59.200
operating system of leftism for the past 200 years, I'm going to keep repeating it, has been

01:00:59.200 --> 01:01:04.000
the dialectic. Now, I want to take a quick diversion into the postmodernists. I'm not going

01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:09.200
to develop this very far. But I also have to touch on one neo-Marxist here, Theodor Adorno.

01:01:09.200 --> 01:01:13.680
So as for the postmodernists, I'm Theodor Adorno, which you can read in his 1966 book called,

01:01:13.760 --> 01:01:19.360
So again, now 1966, we're getting a lot later. Postmodernism is actually emerging in France

01:01:19.360 --> 01:01:26.560
already at this point. In 1966, Adorno writes his book, Negative Dialectics. And in both of

01:01:26.560 --> 01:01:31.040
these cases, postmodernism and in my reading of Negative Dialectics, it seems to be the case that

01:01:31.040 --> 01:01:37.760
we have gone, these guys have actually gone post-Hegelian. The neo-Marxists, or sorry,

01:01:37.760 --> 01:01:40.720
where the critical theorists are normally called neo-Marxists, the postmodernists are usually

01:01:40.720 --> 01:01:45.120
described as post-Marxists. In other words, they've given up on Marxism. They retain much of the same

01:01:45.120 --> 01:01:48.880
underlying ethos, but they don't believe that it works and they become kind of negative and

01:01:48.880 --> 01:01:53.120
despairing and they create kind of an upside down world version of it that just kind of is

01:01:53.840 --> 01:01:59.920
cynical and all of this. Well, it seems that with the publishing of Negative Dialectics,

01:01:59.920 --> 01:02:04.800
which is extraordinarily critical of Hegel, it turns out the postmodernists were also quite

01:02:04.800 --> 01:02:08.960
critical of Hegel. I think Foucault is critical of Hegel and certainly being much more Nietzschean

01:02:08.960 --> 01:02:14.080
in his approach, but I think Derrida, if I'm not mistaken, although I'd have to look that up again,

01:02:14.080 --> 01:02:18.880
is very critical of Hegel. We certainly see Liotard being critical of Hegel as well in

01:02:18.880 --> 01:02:25.680
the postmodern condition. We see this kind of shift with some of these thinkers, postmodernists

01:02:25.680 --> 01:02:30.400
in particular, but also Adorno and Negative Dialectics to a post-Hegelian structure. Now,

01:02:30.400 --> 01:02:35.040
like I just said, to go post means to have retained the essential core of what's going on,

01:02:35.040 --> 01:02:39.920
of the approach. While deciding that the specific projects that had been launched on that core

01:02:39.920 --> 01:02:46.640
must have been being done terribly incorrectly and had failed, so you abandon the specifics while

01:02:46.640 --> 01:02:53.280
retaining the essential core. So in this sense, both the later writings of Adorno getting into the

01:02:53.280 --> 01:02:58.400
1960s and the postmodernists seem very much like they're anti-Hegel on a superficial writing,

01:02:58.400 --> 01:03:03.280
but they're not really that. They're post-Hegelian. They're mostly despairing of the idea of the

01:03:03.280 --> 01:03:07.440
synthetic project, but they're not despairing of the idea, if you read Negative Dialectic,

01:03:07.440 --> 01:03:13.280
of the collision of thesis and antithesis. If you read the ideas like Derrida's deconstruction,

01:03:13.280 --> 01:03:17.040
or even Foucault's ideas where you're going to expose the contradictions and the progress of

01:03:17.040 --> 01:03:23.360
history, or the contradictions of progress, or the contradictions of the idea of calling

01:03:23.360 --> 01:03:29.200
anything knowledge at all, these are still very thesis-antithesis-colliding projects. The thing

01:03:29.200 --> 01:03:35.440
is, these guys aren't looking for a synthesis. They aren't trying to do a final third step. They've

01:03:35.440 --> 01:03:41.600
become post-Hegelian in that they've adopted the dialectical core, but abandoned the idea that

01:03:41.600 --> 01:03:46.320
a synthesis is necessary. Adorno expresses this in Negative Dialectics. Derrida does so through

01:03:46.320 --> 01:03:51.520
deconstruction, and the idea is really to get to particulars, rather than to come up with some

01:03:51.520 --> 01:03:57.120
new synthetic whole. So synthesis for post-Hegelian thought, that's postmodernism, and the later

01:03:57.120 --> 01:04:01.440
Adorno in Negative Dialectic is really a fool's errand for them. They think that's what's gone

01:04:01.440 --> 01:04:06.320
wrong. That's why this has produced terrible results. This is why the Marxist projects failed.

01:04:06.320 --> 01:04:10.880
The idea of trying to create a synthesis out of the dialectical process is a failure. So

01:04:10.880 --> 01:04:14.560
for Adorno, we have to have a negative dialectic for Derrida. We just need to deconstruct.

01:04:15.520 --> 01:04:19.040
So for them, it's better to just take things apart and leave them apart at the level of

01:04:19.040 --> 01:04:23.600
particulars. It's not a very good example, but an example I've tried to give for this

01:04:23.680 --> 01:04:27.360
in the past is, you know, I can go into my living room. It turns out I have a

01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:34.960
very nice round kitchen table, and it has kind of four legs, and I have a small coffee table.

01:04:34.960 --> 01:04:39.520
The kitchen table is wood. The coffee table is metal, as it turns out, and it has three legs,

01:04:39.520 --> 01:04:45.360
and it's kind of shaped somewhat triangularly, but curved, like curvy triangle. And then I have

01:04:45.360 --> 01:04:49.600
like a kitchen island thing that's also wood, but it obviously you can't get under it. It doesn't

01:04:49.600 --> 01:04:55.120
have legs at all. It's like a block and has wheels under it. And so you could easily consider

01:04:55.120 --> 01:04:59.600
those flat surfaces on top of all of these, one being round, one being this weird triangle, one

01:04:59.600 --> 01:05:04.480
being almost perfectly square. Two of these are wood, one of them is metal. There are three different

01:05:04.480 --> 01:05:08.160
heights. They're very different things. You could say, oh, well, they're tables. You could even use

01:05:08.160 --> 01:05:12.880
the couch as a table. You could set things on it. You could lay things out. And so the idea of table

01:05:12.880 --> 01:05:18.800
can be attacked by this idea that, well, these two things are very different from one another,

01:05:18.800 --> 01:05:21.680
but we call them both table, or these three things are very different from one another. We

01:05:21.680 --> 01:05:27.680
call them table. And just leave it. We don't have to call them tables. Leave it at this dining table,

01:05:27.680 --> 01:05:31.920
this coffee table, and this kitchen island. Leave them at particulars. That's sort of the idea.

01:05:33.120 --> 01:05:38.240
So the general thrust here is that the dialectic is, the general thrust of the dialectic is still

01:05:38.240 --> 01:05:41.920
running. We're still going to collide ideas against their opposites, their antithesis,

01:05:41.920 --> 01:05:48.480
their contradictions. They're negatives, really, in the Hegelian frame, but we're not going to try

01:05:48.480 --> 01:05:53.920
to put the broken pieces back together. That's gone. They're in the despair, the pessimism,

01:05:53.920 --> 01:06:02.400
the cynicism of being post-Hegelian, post-Marxist, or post-modernist. Adorno thinks he has the ticket.

01:06:02.400 --> 01:06:05.840
The post-modernists are a little bit more negative. That's a big difference between them,

01:06:05.840 --> 01:06:11.120
but it's difficult to actually tell if you read all of negative dialectic. There's no clear example.

01:06:11.120 --> 01:06:16.160
There are just lots of very abstruse examples. I've read criticisms of negative dialectics

01:06:16.240 --> 01:06:19.520
that it's impossible to understand what the negative dialectics is doing without reading the

01:06:19.520 --> 01:06:23.440
entire book and comprehending it, and then you just have this idea of what it's doing.

01:06:23.440 --> 01:06:26.720
So you don't have any concrete structures. That table thing might be BS.

01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:31.280
As far as Foucault goes, as long as we're talking about post-modernist, he gives his usual critiques

01:06:31.280 --> 01:06:37.040
for what it's worth, that the Hegelian approach might be good or bad. The dialectic might be good

01:06:37.040 --> 01:06:42.960
or bad. I picked this up in the Foucault reader, and I'm trying to, I don't recall, I didn't write

01:06:42.960 --> 01:06:47.840
down which of his essays or books it comes out of, but the Hegelian dialectical approach might be

01:06:47.840 --> 01:06:51.520
good or bad, but the underlying engine of his project is still going to be Hegelian in that

01:06:51.520 --> 01:06:57.120
it's trying to reveal the internal contradictions and ideas like progress, categories, science,

01:06:57.120 --> 01:07:01.520
truth, knowledge, and then just kind of leave it at that because for Foucault, the idea was to

01:07:01.520 --> 01:07:06.800
break down restrictions so that he could so-called expand potentialities. We see the same language

01:07:06.800 --> 01:07:13.520
in Markusa as well, the idea of expanding the potential range of being human into achieving

01:07:13.520 --> 01:07:18.400
liberation. So these are pretty consistent themes. They're ultimately Hegelian. The post-modern

01:07:18.400 --> 01:07:22.240
left is like this despairing, broken, let's not even try to do anything positive with it,

01:07:23.040 --> 01:07:29.120
whereas all of the positive projects that came out of the dialectic are in the synthetic aspect,

01:07:29.120 --> 01:07:34.480
thesis, synthesis, then building a synthesis, and the post-modernists and even this later negative

01:07:34.480 --> 01:07:38.640
dialectic adorno are kind of abandoning that project at this point in the late 60s, whereas

01:07:38.640 --> 01:07:44.000
Markusa is still pretty into it, right, and Markusa really became the defining feature of the new

01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:54.800
left, which means that again, from young Hegelian into Marxist old left into Markusian new left,

01:07:54.800 --> 01:08:02.560
all of the leftists are still operating very strongly in this particular frame, this Hegelian

01:08:02.560 --> 01:08:07.040
dialectical frame. So the dialectic is the operating system of leftism for the past 200

01:08:07.040 --> 01:08:11.840
years. That's the point I really want to take home from this first half of what I'm talking about

01:08:11.840 --> 01:08:17.440
with Hegel. I also have to make the case that this reliance on dialectic, and I'm telling you,

01:08:17.440 --> 01:08:21.760
this is going to be long, there's a lot to this, this reliance on the dialectic appears in the

01:08:21.760 --> 01:08:28.640
woke literature as well. So let's start with Patricia Hill Collins' landmark book in 1990,

01:08:28.640 --> 01:08:33.840
Black Feminist Thought. We're going to see the dialectic invoked repeatedly. Remember also that

01:08:33.840 --> 01:08:39.040
it appears in the Critical Race Theory book, right, and so the dialectic progresses. The bigger

01:08:39.040 --> 01:08:43.280
thing gets resolved, so now we have to look at the smaller thing, so the dialectic progresses.

01:08:43.920 --> 01:08:49.440
That's the theme there in the Critical Race Theory book. Well, here in 1990 in Black Feminist

01:08:49.440 --> 01:08:54.000
Thought, which is a landmark book, it's not quite critical race theory, it's like the proto-critical

01:08:54.000 --> 01:08:59.200
race theory. It is Black Feminism, and the link, by the way, to Black Feminism is that Herbert

01:08:59.200 --> 01:09:03.200
Marcuse not only did he inspire much of the Black Liberationist movement to think in critical

01:09:03.200 --> 01:09:08.000
theory ways, not only was his, or his ideas picked up by that, but they were particularly picked up

01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:13.520
by the Black Feminists. The Black Feminists would have included as a thought leader Angela Davis,

01:09:13.520 --> 01:09:19.600
who was the PhD student of Herbert Marcuse, and she was very, very influential in the development

01:09:19.680 --> 01:09:24.560
of Black Feminist Thought, and Black Feminism comes into its fruit here. You can even find,

01:09:24.560 --> 01:09:29.360
for example, Ibram Kendi praising Angela Davis explicitly in his bookstamps from the beginning,

01:09:29.360 --> 01:09:34.240
which traces five thinkers, one of whom is Angela Davis, a very significant figure in the development

01:09:34.240 --> 01:09:44.320
of woke thought. Here, right at the cusp of the birth of woke, 1990, in kind of the pinnacle book of

01:09:44.320 --> 01:09:49.040
Black Feminist Thought, titled Black Feminist Thought, from Patricia Hill Collins,

01:09:50.640 --> 01:09:57.360
gigantic figure in the field, we read, Black Feminism remains important because

01:09:57.360 --> 01:10:04.000
U.S. Black women constitute an oppressed group. As a collectivity, U.S. Black women participate

01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:08.960
in a dialectical relationship linking African American women's oppression and activism.

01:10:08.960 --> 01:10:13.520
So oppression and activism have to be related dialectically. Dialectical relationships of

01:10:13.520 --> 01:10:19.200
this sort mean that two parties are opposed and opposite. As long as Black women's subordination

01:10:19.200 --> 01:10:25.760
within intersecting oppressions of race, class, gender, sexuality, and nation persists, Black

01:10:25.760 --> 01:10:31.200
Feminism as an activist response to that oppression will remain needed. In similar fashion, the

01:10:31.200 --> 01:10:36.320
overarching purpose of U.S. Black Feminist Thought is also to resist oppression, both its practices

01:10:36.320 --> 01:10:41.280
and the ideas that justify it. If intersecting oppressions did not exist, Black Feminist Thought

01:10:41.280 --> 01:10:47.600
and similar oppositional knowledges would be unnecessary. As a critical social theory,

01:10:47.600 --> 01:10:52.560
Black Feminist Thought aims to empower African American women within the context of social

01:10:52.560 --> 01:10:59.600
injustice sustained by intersecting oppressions. Since Black women cannot be fully empowered

01:10:59.600 --> 01:11:04.640
unless intersecting oppressions themselves are eliminated, Black Feminist Thought supports

01:11:04.640 --> 01:11:10.880
broad principles of social justice that transcend U.S. Black women's particular needs. Dialectical

01:11:10.880 --> 01:11:18.240
relationships, dialectical thinking. Already present here, very core to understanding how

01:11:18.240 --> 01:11:25.840
Black women as a collectivity, as a political group, are related to all the other axes of

01:11:25.840 --> 01:11:30.080
oppression and how they're to understand their own oppression and how these oppressions bang up

01:11:30.080 --> 01:11:35.200
against each other and compete against one another and clamor for attention. And the goal,

01:11:36.160 --> 01:11:41.360
as we haven't talked about yet, but from Markuza, is to create solidarity. And that solidarity,

01:11:41.360 --> 01:11:45.200
as we'll talk about a little bit more later, is to be affected through intersectionality. By the way,

01:11:45.200 --> 01:11:49.520
the title of Patricia Hill Collins' next big book after Black Feminist Thought in 1990 was

01:11:50.160 --> 01:11:55.760
Intersectionality. 1993, if I'm not mistaken, though I don't have it in front of me. So what

01:11:55.760 --> 01:12:00.240
else does she write in Black Feminist Thought? This dialectic of oppression and activism,

01:12:00.240 --> 01:12:04.800
the tension between the suppression of African American women's ideas and our intellectual

01:12:04.800 --> 01:12:09.840
activism in the face of that suppression, constitutes the politics of US Black feminist

01:12:09.840 --> 01:12:15.200
thought. The dialectics of oppression and activism constitutes the politics of US Black feminist

01:12:15.200 --> 01:12:20.800
thought. More important, understanding this dialectical relationship is critical in assessing

01:12:20.800 --> 01:12:25.280
how US Black feminist thought, its core themes, epistemological significance, and connections

01:12:25.280 --> 01:12:30.240
to domestic and transnational Black feminist practice is fundamentally embedded in a political

01:12:30.320 --> 01:12:40.240
context that has challenged its very right to exist. So dialectic, it is the politics. The

01:12:40.240 --> 01:12:44.240
dialectic of oppression and activism constitutes the politics of US Black feminist thought.

01:12:45.040 --> 01:12:49.040
I'm telling you, it's the operating system upon which all of this stuff is based. The critical

01:12:49.040 --> 01:12:54.320
race theory comes out of Black feminism. Hello. Okay, so what else does she write in Black Feminist

01:12:54.320 --> 01:12:58.880
Thought? I have several quotes from this. Historically, while they often disagreed on its

01:12:58.880 --> 01:13:03.920
expression, some US Black women were profoundly reformist, while more radical thinkers bordered

01:13:03.920 --> 01:13:08.400
on the revolutionary. African American women intellectuals, who were nurtured in social

01:13:08.400 --> 01:13:12.880
conditions of racial segregation, strove to develop Black feminist thought as critical social

01:13:12.880 --> 01:13:17.280
theory. Regardless of, remember that's critical theory, right? That's critical theory, which is

01:13:17.280 --> 01:13:21.440
based in the dialectic, because we just heard that from Horkheimer just a minute ago. Regardless

01:13:21.440 --> 01:13:26.400
of social class and other differences among US Black women, all were in some way affected by

01:13:26.400 --> 01:13:31.040
intersecting oppressions of race, gender, and class. The economic, political, and ideological

01:13:31.040 --> 01:13:34.720
dimensions of US Black women's oppression suppressed the intellectual production of

01:13:34.720 --> 01:13:40.000
individual Black feminist thinkers. At the same time, these same social conditions simultaneously

01:13:40.000 --> 01:13:45.520
stimulated distinctive patterns of US Black women's activism that also influenced and was influenced

01:13:45.520 --> 01:13:51.920
by individual Black women thinkers. Thus, the dialectic of oppression and activism characterizing

01:13:51.920 --> 01:13:58.240
US Black women's experience with intersecting oppressions also influenced the ideas and actions

01:13:58.240 --> 01:14:04.880
of Black women intellectuals. Dialectic, dialectic, dialectic. We're drawing a straight line now

01:14:06.000 --> 01:14:11.280
that is the twist. That's why I shouldn't call it a straight line. It's like a twisting line,

01:14:12.080 --> 01:14:18.800
twisting and concentrating line, from Hegel straight to Patricia Hill Collins, Black feminist

01:14:18.800 --> 01:14:22.560
thought. The reason that that line is twisting and concentrating is because the dialectic is

01:14:22.560 --> 01:14:28.960
being applied to the dialectical process as it goes. She writes again, as long as social justice

01:14:28.960 --> 01:14:33.920
remains elusive for African American women, it is likely to evade US society overall. This is

01:14:33.920 --> 01:14:37.920
always just asserted, by the way. They just say that if Black women don't have all of whatever

01:14:37.920 --> 01:14:42.800
they want, then US society doesn't have it either. That's just an assertion that's core to critical

01:14:42.800 --> 01:14:47.520
race theory. In this case, Black feminism, from which critical race theory sprung. What do you

01:14:47.520 --> 01:14:52.960
think Kimberly Crenshaw was? Black feminist. Therefore, Collins writes, the need for Black

01:14:52.960 --> 01:14:58.240
women's activism is most likely will persist. But while the dialectical relationship linking

01:14:58.240 --> 01:15:03.600
oppression and activism remains, that's theory and practice, or in other words, praxis as its

01:15:04.640 --> 01:15:09.440
synthesis, the changing organization of intersecting oppressions as well as the contours of activism

01:15:09.440 --> 01:15:16.320
required for resistance demand a dynamic Black women's activism and an equally vigorous US Black

01:15:16.320 --> 01:15:19.600
feminism. So theory and practice both have to be put into play. We're going to see that theory

01:15:19.600 --> 01:15:24.480
and practical are very central to the way that Hegel thought about these things as well, and

01:15:24.480 --> 01:15:29.600
dialectic had applied to it. And of course, Marx derived the idea of praxis, which is theory put

01:15:29.600 --> 01:15:36.960
into practice from these same ideas. So the lines are very straight here. So one more from

01:15:36.960 --> 01:15:42.800
Patricia Hill Collins. Thus far this volume, this is near the end of the book, has synthesized two

01:15:42.800 --> 01:15:47.440
main approaches to power. One way of approaching power concerns the dialectical relationship

01:15:47.440 --> 01:15:52.720
linking oppression and activism, where groups with greater power oppress those with lesser amounts.

01:15:52.720 --> 01:16:01.440
Rather than seeing social change or lack of it as preordained and outside the realm of human

01:16:01.440 --> 01:16:06.560
action, the notion of a dialectical relationship suggests that change results from human agency.

01:16:06.560 --> 01:16:10.720
Because African American women remain relegated to the bottom of the social hierarchy from one

01:16:10.720 --> 01:16:16.000
generation to the next, again just asserted, US Black women have a vested interest in opposing

01:16:16.000 --> 01:16:21.520
oppression. This is not an intellectual issue for most African American women. It is a lived

01:16:21.520 --> 01:16:28.880
reality, lived reality indeed. As long as Black women's oppression persists, so will the need for

01:16:28.880 --> 01:16:34.400
Black women's activism. Moreover, dialectical analyses of power point out that when it comes to

01:16:34.400 --> 01:16:39.040
social injustice, groups have competing interests that often generate conflict.

01:16:40.400 --> 01:16:50.160
So Black feminism, one of the key intellectual roots of critical race theory, one of the key pillars

01:16:51.120 --> 01:16:59.840
theories within critical social justice theory, dialectic. Its engine is dialectical. The dialectical

01:16:59.840 --> 01:17:08.160
engine tracing all the way back to Hegel. This is again modified by Faurbach, modified by Marx,

01:17:08.160 --> 01:17:13.360
modified by the Neo-Marx, just modified again by Marcuse, modified again into Black feminism

01:17:13.360 --> 01:17:18.960
through dialectical processes at every single step. This is what we're seeing, the dialectical

01:17:18.960 --> 01:17:25.920
engine, dialectical operating system of leftism, both old leftism, new leftism that's following

01:17:26.000 --> 01:17:34.960
Marcuse and now woke leftism. So we can see the same reliance on dialectic in Bell Hooks' book.

01:17:34.960 --> 01:17:40.960
Bell Hooks is a Black feminist as well. In 1984, she writes feminist theory from margin to center.

01:17:40.960 --> 01:17:45.040
This is a very huge theme for them, margins to center. Kimberly Crenshaw's famous paper,

01:17:45.040 --> 01:17:50.800
Mapping the Margins. What is Bell Hooks' right in 1984? Yet women need to know that ideas and

01:17:50.800 --> 01:18:00.400
theories are important. And absolutely essential for envisioning and making a successful feminist

01:18:00.400 --> 01:18:06.080
movement, one that will mobilize groups of people to transform this society. Ironically,

01:18:06.080 --> 01:18:10.880
lack of knowledge about revolutionary politics leads women to see ideas and theories as unimportant.

01:18:11.440 --> 01:18:16.960
In the chapter on dialectics and revolution, Grace Lee Boggs and James Boggs discuss the

01:18:16.960 --> 01:18:26.400
importance of ideas to revolutionary activists. What do they write? Revolutionists seek to

01:18:26.400 --> 01:18:31.040
change reality to make it better. Therefore, revolutionists not only need the revolutionary

01:18:31.040 --> 01:18:37.920
philosophy of dialectics, they need a revolutionary ideology, a body of ideas, based on analyzing

01:18:37.920 --> 01:18:41.520
the main contradictions of the particular society which they're trying to change,

01:18:41.520 --> 01:18:46.160
projecting a vision of a higher form of reality in which this contradiction would be resolved

01:18:46.240 --> 01:18:51.520
and relating this resolution to a social force or force is responsible for and capable of achieving

01:18:51.520 --> 01:18:56.080
it. In other words, a critical theory that's like the definition of a critical theory right there.

01:18:56.080 --> 01:19:00.960
How does it operate through a revolutionary philosophy of dialectics? So this is quoted

01:19:00.960 --> 01:19:05.200
in Bell Hooks' book as support for the case that she's making that black feminists,

01:19:05.200 --> 01:19:09.840
in particular, and feminists more in general, need to be thinking in terms of philosophies

01:19:09.840 --> 01:19:13.040
and ideas if they're going to have a successful movement. They can't be anti-intellectuals,

01:19:13.040 --> 01:19:21.440
she's writing. So the bogs go on as quoted in Bell Hooks. It is only after you have arrived at the

01:19:21.440 --> 01:19:26.000
correct ideology that it makes sense to develop your revolutionary politics, i.e. the programs

01:19:26.000 --> 01:19:31.040
necessary to mobilizing and organizing the revolutionary social forces. If your ideology

01:19:31.040 --> 01:19:36.560
is wrong, that is misdirected or limited, then all of the most brilliant programs for militant

01:19:36.560 --> 01:19:41.440
activity must be absolutely clear about this sequence from revolutionary philosophy to

01:19:41.520 --> 01:19:48.400
revolutionary ideology to revolutionary politics. The dialectic is at the heart of this.

01:19:49.680 --> 01:19:55.520
Bell Hooks, extremely influential, writing in 1984 about the centrality of the dialectic.

01:19:55.520 --> 01:20:03.200
What he's described here is literally, literally the Hegelian dialectic, right? Did you catch it,

01:20:03.200 --> 01:20:08.480
right? Read that sentence again. They need a revolutionary ideology that is a body of ideas

01:20:08.480 --> 01:20:12.400
based on analyzing the main contradictions of the particular society. We're going to see that's

01:20:12.400 --> 01:20:17.600
related to the Geist, which they are trying to change, projecting a vision of a higher form of

01:20:17.600 --> 01:20:24.400
reality. So there's your ideas, the idealism, in which this contradiction would be resolved

01:20:24.400 --> 01:20:30.000
and relating this resolution to a social force or forces responsible for and capable of achieving it.

01:20:30.000 --> 01:20:34.400
As we'll see, Hegel is a great big statist. So we're going to see this kind of trinity

01:20:34.400 --> 01:20:41.360
of the kind of the culture or the spirit of society giving rise to the idea and the relationship to

01:20:41.360 --> 01:20:45.200
the ideas of society and the ideas and the relationship to the state and the state in its

01:20:45.200 --> 01:20:51.680
relationship to, again, that spirit of society. There's a very Hegelian sentence that is Hegel.

01:20:51.680 --> 01:20:58.800
That is Hegel quoted from two bogs in Bell Hooks's book in 1984. Bell Hooks being absolutely

01:20:58.800 --> 01:21:04.160
instrumental to the rising of somewhat of critical history, but actually of inserting critical

01:21:04.160 --> 01:21:09.680
race theory in Black feminist thought, which we just discussed from Collins, directly into

01:21:09.680 --> 01:21:16.240
critical pedagogy into education after her book in 1994, Book Teaching to Transgress. So again,

01:21:16.240 --> 01:21:21.920
the operating system is the dialectic and the dialectic derives from Hegel as concentrated by

01:21:21.920 --> 01:21:27.840
Fauerbach Marx, various neo-Marxists, Marcuse, the Black feminists. And here we see it arising

01:21:27.920 --> 01:21:35.840
quoted in his almost original form, frankly, in a call for revolutionary politics. It requires

01:21:35.840 --> 01:21:44.000
a revolutionary dialectic and a perfect ideology in Bell Hooks, 1984. Just to give you another,

01:21:44.000 --> 01:21:46.720
I mean, I've got several more examples we're going to read through. I'm sorry, I need you to

01:21:46.720 --> 01:21:49.840
understand that this is really what's happening in the world today. If you want to understand the

01:21:49.840 --> 01:21:54.720
woke, you have to understand the dialectic. Kimberly Crenshaw, the creator of intersectionality,

01:21:54.720 --> 01:21:58.000
one of the founders of critical race theory, actually the person who named critical race theory

01:21:58.800 --> 01:22:03.280
also thinks dialectically. This becomes very obvious in her chapter that's titled Unmasking,

01:22:03.280 --> 01:22:07.280
Color Blindness in the Law, Lessons from the Formation of Critical Race Theory, that

01:22:07.920 --> 01:22:14.000
is the third chapter in a volume that she edited in 2019, titled Seeing Race Again. What a wonderful

01:22:14.000 --> 01:22:18.880
concept she's driving here, becoming racists. But Seeing Race Again is the title of the book,

01:22:18.880 --> 01:22:24.640
2019 book. So she wrote this essay as a chapter for the book. And she writes in there, this essay

01:22:24.640 --> 01:22:29.520
this is the beginning of the essay, revisits the history of how critical race theory, CRT,

01:22:29.520 --> 01:22:34.160
emerged as an intellectual response to color blindness and the context of institutional

01:22:34.160 --> 01:22:39.120
struggles over the scope of equality and the content of legal education. It exemplifies how

01:22:39.120 --> 01:22:43.600
in the aftermath of a groundbreaking challenge to the social order, institutional actors from

01:22:43.600 --> 01:22:48.880
across the political spectrum embraced a gradualist strategy of integration, premised on the assumption

01:22:48.880 --> 01:22:55.200
that the colorblind meritocracy stood outside of the economic and racial power. The emergence and

01:22:55.200 --> 01:23:00.480
continuing significance of CRT in relation to colorblind ideology is a reflection of the cross

01:23:00.480 --> 01:23:05.520
institutional traveling of resistance, the conditions of possibility that seed insurgent

01:23:05.520 --> 01:23:12.240
knowledge and the continuity of these dialectics in the contemporary era. So she's thinking

01:23:12.240 --> 01:23:16.880
dialectically. So I don't want to keep belaboring this point, but since I mentioned with Bellhooks

01:23:16.880 --> 01:23:21.360
especially, and it's so important with an education, that the idea of teaching this

01:23:21.360 --> 01:23:26.080
dialect so we have this engine of the left, I've got it up through critical race theory and black

01:23:26.080 --> 01:23:30.160
feminism now all the way back to Hegel through Marx, Faurbach, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera,

01:23:30.160 --> 01:23:36.560
Alonio Marxist, Mercuzza, we see Adorno defect from it after he writes the dialectic of enlightenment

01:23:36.560 --> 01:23:41.840
with Horkheimer. And then all the way with a straight line, Hegel to the young Hegelians,

01:23:41.840 --> 01:23:47.840
those are first progressive in this line of thought becoming Marxist. So then the old left

01:23:47.840 --> 01:23:53.680
arises out of that. The old left gives way to the new left. The new left is the neo Marxist

01:23:53.680 --> 01:23:59.280
left under Mercuzza. And this new left is dialectically driven. And this new left gives rise

01:23:59.280 --> 01:24:02.800
to the black feminism movement and these other radicalist movements that we're seeing now.

01:24:02.800 --> 01:24:07.360
And they are dialectically driven all the way up to a book in 2019 where Kimberly Crenshaw,

01:24:07.360 --> 01:24:13.440
the founder of critical race theory is saying that the dialectics is crucial to what she's

01:24:13.440 --> 01:24:18.240
saying. And along the way we have Bell Hooks who inspired Kimberly Crenshaw, for example,

01:24:18.240 --> 01:24:23.840
writing and quoting somebody who basically lays out the exact Hegelian vision in the modern day.

01:24:23.840 --> 01:24:28.320
So this is all extremely important. We now have that this is the underlying operating system of

01:24:28.320 --> 01:24:34.400
the left, I think is a continuous old left, new left, or young Hegelian really, to old left,

01:24:34.400 --> 01:24:40.640
which is Marxism to new left, which is neo Marxism to woke left continuity. But it's also

01:24:40.640 --> 01:24:46.240
crucial in education. This is how they teach it. This is what their goal is to teach children to

01:24:46.240 --> 01:24:50.400
think dialectically because that's the engine of their worldview. That's how they think about the

01:24:50.400 --> 01:24:55.040
world. So it is the heart of the critical pedagogy project, which is the critical theory applied

01:24:55.040 --> 01:24:59.600
to both the theory of education and the contents of education. So the dominant mode of education

01:24:59.600 --> 01:25:05.120
in the West today seeks to teach our children the Hegelian dialectical mode, because that's the

01:25:05.120 --> 01:25:10.800
underlying operating system of how leftism operates in our society. And they have totally

01:25:10.800 --> 01:25:15.760
dominated the institution of education, following Gramsci's indication that education is one of

01:25:15.760 --> 01:25:20.400
the five pillars of culture that must be infiltrated and overturned from within. So here,

01:25:20.400 --> 01:25:24.800
reading from Isaac Gottzman's The Critical Turn in Education, which was a book from 2015,

01:25:25.440 --> 01:25:30.080
we talked about probably the most influential critical pedagogist, his name is Henry Giroux.

01:25:30.080 --> 01:25:35.360
He writes, students argued Giroux, this is quoting Giroux, need to learn how to be able to move

01:25:35.360 --> 01:25:40.480
outside of their own frame of reference so that they can question the legitimacy of a given fact,

01:25:40.480 --> 01:25:47.040
concept, or issue. He wrote that in 1978. Now to Gottzman. Furthermore, he contended marshaling

01:25:47.040 --> 01:25:52.640
the support of Marxist literary theorist Frederick Jamison. Students quote, this is quoting Giroux,

01:25:52.640 --> 01:25:57.120
have to learn how to perceive the very essence of what they're examining by placing it critically

01:25:57.120 --> 01:26:01.120
within a system of relationships that give it meaning. In other words, students must be taught

01:26:01.120 --> 01:26:08.560
to think dialectically, rather than in an isolated and compartmentalized fashion. For Giroux,

01:26:08.560 --> 01:26:13.280
it was important that contextualization of information be embedded in a pedagogy that

01:26:13.280 --> 01:26:20.240
takes seriously the social relationships of the classroom. This goes way back in education, however.

01:26:21.200 --> 01:26:26.640
You can read from John Dewey, who's a very progressive education reformer, very influential

01:26:26.640 --> 01:26:30.880
in our current education system. He was in the late 19th century when he wrote in, again,

01:26:30.880 --> 01:26:35.840
perfect Hegelian fashion, quote, the state is then the completed objective spirit. That's like

01:26:35.840 --> 01:26:42.560
Brian Strait Hegel, the externalized reason of man. It reconciles the principle of law and liberty,

01:26:42.560 --> 01:26:47.520
not by bringing some truce or external harmony between them, but by making the law, the whole

01:26:47.600 --> 01:26:52.560
of the prevailing interest and controlling motive of the individual. We haven't really touched on

01:26:52.560 --> 01:26:55.760
Hegel's statism yet, but that's going to be relevant. I just wanted to drop that in there,

01:26:55.760 --> 01:27:01.200
because it's tied into critical education. Even going back more than 100 years,

01:27:01.200 --> 01:27:07.520
so this is being written just before 1900, we have this idea that the Hegelian view of the state,

01:27:09.280 --> 01:27:14.960
the completed objective spirit that's so freaking Hegelian, is Hegel's metaphysics.

01:27:15.360 --> 01:27:19.440
The way that you get at that completed objective spirit, the externalized reason

01:27:19.440 --> 01:27:25.040
of man is through the dialectic. We have the whole dialectical project here. There's a link,

01:27:25.040 --> 01:27:29.200
by the way, not just, I mentioned Bill Hooks inserting critical race theory into critical

01:27:29.200 --> 01:27:34.160
pedagogy. Critical pedagogy is rising up. There's another guy before who is very important,

01:27:34.160 --> 01:27:37.840
but less influential than Jiru, before him named Michael Apple. Michael Apple, repeatedly,

01:27:37.840 --> 01:27:41.600
if you read Gatzman, you'll find out that he repeatedly talks about the need for dialectic

01:27:41.600 --> 01:27:48.160
and education. But then later, even today, even very recently, we can see the insertion of this

01:27:48.160 --> 01:27:51.920
kind of dialectical line of thought, but important in Neomarxism, which we now know is based on the

01:27:51.920 --> 01:27:57.840
dialectical thought into education. So we read from an Allison Bailey's paper, Tracking Privilege

01:27:57.840 --> 01:28:01.840
Preserving Epistemic Pushback, which appeared in the classrooms or something, the exact title.

01:28:03.120 --> 01:28:07.600
It was published in Hypatia in 2017, Hypatia being the leading feminist philosophy journal that

01:28:07.600 --> 01:28:14.560
very much so dips into critical pedagogy. It was the target of two of our fake papers,

01:28:14.560 --> 01:28:19.440
one of which was a critical pedagogy paper. But this brings very to the front that critical

01:28:19.440 --> 01:28:25.280
pedagogy is based very deeply, also not just in Jiru's belief that the dialectic should be

01:28:25.280 --> 01:28:30.400
brought into the classroom, but also that Neomarxism itself should be brought into the classroom.

01:28:30.400 --> 01:28:34.960
What does she write in 2017, Allison Bailey? Quote, the critical thinking tradition is concerned

01:28:34.960 --> 01:28:38.640
primarily with epistemic adequacy, which is a fancy way of saying knowing what you're talking

01:28:38.640 --> 01:28:43.280
about. To be critical is to show good judgment and recognizing when arguments are faulty,

01:28:43.280 --> 01:28:47.760
assertions lack evidence, truth claims appeal to unreliable sources or concepts are sloppily

01:28:47.760 --> 01:28:53.280
crafted and applied. That's true. For critical thinkers, the problem is that people fail to

01:28:53.280 --> 01:28:58.000
examine the assumptions, commitments, and logic of daily life. The basic problem is irrational,

01:28:58.000 --> 01:29:03.520
illogical, and unexamined living. End quote. Well, if you read Markuza, you know what she's talking

01:29:03.600 --> 01:29:07.520
about. She doesn't cite Markuza. She's not quoting Markuza there. But you're not living that unless

01:29:07.520 --> 01:29:11.280
you're a critical theorist, according to Markuza. So unless you're approaching the world from critical

01:29:11.280 --> 01:29:16.320
theory, you're stuck in irrational, illogical, unexamined living that fails to examine the

01:29:16.320 --> 01:29:20.240
assumptions, commitments, and logic of daily life. You're caught up in his so-called heteronymous

01:29:20.240 --> 01:29:25.120
interests that I've mentioned in many podcasts so far. Okay, so here's she's framing out that

01:29:25.120 --> 01:29:29.120
critical thinking isn't really critical thinking, which is exactly what Markuza does in Neomarxism.

01:29:30.080 --> 01:29:36.000
In this tradition, Bayley continues, sloppy claims can be identified and fixed by learning to apply

01:29:36.000 --> 01:29:42.880
the tools of formal and informal logic correctly. Critical pedagogy begins from a different set

01:29:42.880 --> 01:29:48.240
of assumptions rooted in the Neomarxian literature on critical theory, commonly associated with the

01:29:48.240 --> 01:29:53.360
Frankfurt School. Not really hedging anything there, is she? Here, the critical learner is someone

01:29:53.360 --> 01:29:58.000
who is empowered and motivated to seek justice and emancipation. That's what Markuza says.

01:29:58.640 --> 01:30:03.040
Critical pedagogy regards the claims that students make in response to social justice issues,

01:30:03.040 --> 01:30:07.680
not as propositions to be assessed for their truth value, but expressions of power that

01:30:07.680 --> 01:30:13.120
function to re-inscribe and perpetuate social inequalities. Its mission is to teach students

01:30:13.120 --> 01:30:18.080
ways of identifying and mapping how power shapes our understandings of the world. This is the first

01:30:18.080 --> 01:30:23.280
step in toward resisting and transforming social injustices, in other words, the dialectic, where

01:30:23.280 --> 01:30:29.120
theory has to be whited to practice to generate praxis. By interrogating the politics of knowledge

01:30:29.120 --> 01:30:34.000
production, Bayley writes, this tradition also calls into question the uses of the accepted

01:30:34.000 --> 01:30:39.680
critical thinking toolkit to determine epistemic adequacy, to extend Audre Lorde's classic metaphor,

01:30:39.680 --> 01:30:45.200
not that classic, it was written in 1984, but anyway, the tools of the critical thinking tradition,

01:30:45.200 --> 01:30:49.600
for example, validity, soundness, conceptual clarity, cannot dismantle the master's house,

01:30:49.680 --> 01:30:54.800
they can temporarily beat the master at his own game, but they can never bring about any

01:30:54.800 --> 01:31:00.080
enduring structural change. They fail because the critical thinkers toolkit is commonly invoked

01:31:00.080 --> 01:31:05.520
in particular settings at particular times to reassert power. Those adept with the tools

01:31:05.520 --> 01:31:10.880
often use them to restore an order that assures their comfort. They can be habitually invoked

01:31:10.880 --> 01:31:16.000
to defend our epistemic home terrains. So critical pedagogy for her for Alison Bailey

01:31:16.000 --> 01:31:20.960
is based on neo-Marxism, she echoes Marcusa virtually perfectly, and she's talking about

01:31:20.960 --> 01:31:25.760
teaching people to think in terms of ways that are going to be emancipatory and empowering

01:31:25.760 --> 01:31:30.400
in perfect line with the dialectical process outlined by Marcusa. So in education,

01:31:30.400 --> 01:31:34.960
we see this again and again and again and again now under critical pedagogy. So we're not just

01:31:34.960 --> 01:31:40.320
satisfied that the leftism isn't just satisfied, I should say to use the dialectical method as

01:31:40.320 --> 01:31:44.880
its operating system, it must install that operating system in children, which is why I've

01:31:44.880 --> 01:31:52.240
said repeatedly that the woke don't use education to indoctrinate, they use education to program

01:31:52.240 --> 01:31:59.200
and reprogram. They're not teaching you to accept a particular doctrine uncritically,

01:31:59.200 --> 01:32:02.800
although that is happening as well. They're teaching you to think in a particular way,

01:32:02.800 --> 01:32:10.560
and that way is dialectically. Again, we heard that explicitly, not metaphorically, not anything

01:32:10.560 --> 01:32:17.120
explicitly from Henry Giroux, considered the father of critical pedagogy, what he said is,

01:32:17.120 --> 01:32:23.520
in other words, students must be taught to think dialectically. So that is the object here, that

01:32:23.520 --> 01:32:28.960
is what's going on, and I could go on with this at length. Over and over and over again, quoting

01:32:28.960 --> 01:32:34.560
from luminaries across this dialectical left, if you will, the inheritors of young Hegelian thought,

01:32:34.560 --> 01:32:38.640
including Marx down through the neo-Marxist through the leading lights of critical race theory and

01:32:38.640 --> 01:32:42.800
every other critical social justice theory today, and I could quote from them again and again and

01:32:42.800 --> 01:32:48.880
again showing explicitly, not hedging a single word, that the dialectical mode of thought is how

01:32:48.880 --> 01:32:53.280
they think about everything. It is their underlying operating system, it is the heart of their

01:32:53.280 --> 01:33:02.320
interrelated worldviews, and it comes from Hegel, the first to consciously apply it in the words

01:33:02.320 --> 01:33:10.480
of the Marxists on marxist.org. So a couple more quick points that finalize my case on this,

01:33:10.480 --> 01:33:14.320
and then I'll move on to the metaphysical part, which is the second more difficult case to make.

01:33:14.960 --> 01:33:20.000
I think I've really hammered this one in. First, recall that we began by reading

01:33:21.360 --> 01:33:24.000
from the book, Critical Race Theory and Introduction, which ended with, and so the

01:33:24.000 --> 01:33:27.520
dialectic progresses. I want to draw your attention back to that. So if you recall,

01:33:27.520 --> 01:33:33.360
that little piece was framed out in terms of the so-called essentialism versus anti-essentialism

01:33:33.360 --> 01:33:37.280
philosophical program, and I brought that up. I mentioned that that was important,

01:33:37.920 --> 01:33:45.360
and it's the way the section in which that phrase appears is in a section in the book,

01:33:45.920 --> 01:33:51.360
or is a section in the book, where it's analyzing how critical race theory interacts with the ideas

01:33:51.360 --> 01:33:55.760
of essentialism versus anti-essentialism. But these two, essentialism and anti-essentialism,

01:33:55.760 --> 01:34:03.520
are clearly thesis antithesis. It's thesis antithetical in its construction, essentialism

01:34:03.520 --> 01:34:09.680
versus its negation anti-essentialism. So what then is the woke synthesis? It's forwarded,

01:34:09.680 --> 01:34:14.320
say, by critical race theory. It's in the critical race theory book, but also by the other theories

01:34:14.320 --> 01:34:18.800
of critical social justice. The answer is structural determinism. This is a very important

01:34:18.800 --> 01:34:22.640
concept. I've talked about it in some other podcasts. I'm not going to elaborate on it too

01:34:22.640 --> 01:34:27.200
much here, but it is the structure of society. The hypothesis, structural determinism, is the

01:34:28.000 --> 01:34:32.480
doctrine, really, that the structure of society determines something like an essential lived

01:34:32.480 --> 01:34:40.640
experience. It's not essentialist because it nevertheless hides within a social constructivist

01:34:40.640 --> 01:34:46.160
mode of thought. So race, under critical race theory, is a social construct. So race can't be

01:34:46.160 --> 01:34:52.800
essential to the person. So it dodges essentialism. But they claim that race, and this is explicitly

01:34:53.440 --> 01:34:58.960
articulated by Crenshaw and many others, that race is sociopolitically imposed by the white

01:34:58.960 --> 01:35:04.320
and the allegedly white supremacist and racist society, so that the lived experience of being a

01:35:04.320 --> 01:35:12.880
particular race in that system becomes essential. So race is not essential in the sense that they

01:35:12.960 --> 01:35:18.160
are social constructivists, thus anti-essentialist, but the experience of being a race in a particular

01:35:18.160 --> 01:35:23.600
power structure where that race is imposed by that power structure does define what it means

01:35:23.600 --> 01:35:27.520
to be that kind of a person, of that identity category. We hear that again and again in Black

01:35:27.520 --> 01:35:31.200
Feminist Thought. We just heard it from Patricia Collins over and over and over again about Black

01:35:31.200 --> 01:35:38.560
women. So your lived experience becomes essential. So via the dialectic, critical race theory gets

01:35:38.560 --> 01:35:43.760
to be race-essentialist while claiming it's race-anti-essentialist. And so it's really hard

01:35:43.760 --> 01:35:48.160
to pin down whether or not it's race-essentialist or not, because it's taken essentialism and

01:35:48.160 --> 01:35:52.320
anti-essentialism, collided them in the dialectic, and produced this new thing that's hard to fight

01:35:52.320 --> 01:35:57.440
called structural determinism. And structural determinism is the logic behind how they organize

01:35:57.440 --> 01:36:02.720
society. When they say things like, for example, that positionality must be consciously engaged

01:36:02.720 --> 01:36:06.640
or intentionally engaged. That's a Robin D'Angelo. It appears all over the place in Robin D'Angelo's

01:36:06.640 --> 01:36:11.840
writing. That's what she's talking about. Structural determinism has to be taken into account.

01:36:11.840 --> 01:36:15.920
Structural determinism allows them to be essentialist while claiming anti-essentialism,

01:36:15.920 --> 01:36:19.600
and it keeps people from being able to pin down what they're actually doing and why and how they're

01:36:19.600 --> 01:36:26.960
actually racist. It's by claiming a imposed lived experience that people aren't allowed to buck.

01:36:26.960 --> 01:36:31.840
So they had a dialectical synthesis of these two ideas. And that's what's going on when the

01:36:31.840 --> 01:36:37.120
so the dialectic progresses into yet another deeper intersectional group in that book. That's

01:36:37.120 --> 01:36:41.120
what's what's being talked about. And of course, again, I draw your attention to the word progress,

01:36:41.120 --> 01:36:46.400
progresses. That's the idea behind Hegel's that dialectic is constantly progressing through an

01:36:46.400 --> 01:36:52.880
arc of history. So this is still the operating system. And finally, on this part of the podcast,

01:36:52.880 --> 01:36:56.720
anyway, we're going to keep going, I'll note that the entire concept I've kind of hinted at this

01:36:56.720 --> 01:37:01.120
already of intersectionality as framed out by Kimberly Crenshaw is also just a huge dialectical

01:37:01.120 --> 01:37:07.680
machine. I did a podcast series on Crenshaw's mapping the margins, her most famous paper.

01:37:07.680 --> 01:37:12.160
So people who want to know more about how I identify the dialectic in intersectionality itself

01:37:12.160 --> 01:37:15.200
can go listen to that and hear me develop the thought there. That's really where I developed

01:37:15.200 --> 01:37:19.600
it the first time. But in its core essence, intersectionality turns critique inward

01:37:20.480 --> 01:37:27.360
into itself really, it takes already so-called marginalized activist groups and dialectically

01:37:27.360 --> 01:37:32.960
attacks them. They attack themselves with their own tool. Feminists have to confront their racism.

01:37:32.960 --> 01:37:36.880
Black Liberations have to confront their sexism and misogyny. And also everybody's going to have

01:37:36.880 --> 01:37:42.480
to confront their homophobia or whatever. The goal that is stated there is to create solidarity.

01:37:42.480 --> 01:37:47.120
But if you read Markouza's essay on tolerance, section four, it's a four part essay, is just

01:37:47.120 --> 01:37:52.560
solidarity. Solidarity is the objective that is said to create liberation. So this is all we're

01:37:52.640 --> 01:37:59.520
seeing here is the same dialectical neo-Marxist engine. So solidarity becomes the dialectical

01:37:59.520 --> 01:38:04.640
synthesis of these competing, remember where Patricia Collins was talking about the competing

01:38:04.640 --> 01:38:08.880
forms of identity and their oppressions. Intersectionality becomes the synthesis

01:38:09.920 --> 01:38:13.840
of these competing forms of oppression and the dialectic of oppression and activism that she

01:38:13.840 --> 01:38:21.600
keeps talking about. Intersectionality becomes the synthesis there. Of course, Markouza also

01:38:22.240 --> 01:38:27.200
says that we have to biologically change mankind to want and need liberation.

01:38:27.200 --> 01:38:31.520
And that will actually be done by changing them biologically to want and need solidarity to

01:38:31.520 --> 01:38:36.480
want another, to create a whole new kind of man, liberated man, kind of an echo of the new Soviet

01:38:36.480 --> 01:38:44.560
man that will be able to tolerate and usher in liberation. But Markouza's eugenics is another

01:38:44.560 --> 01:38:50.000
topic for another day. The point here though is the dialectical critique, really what we're going

01:38:50.000 --> 01:38:55.760
to see is the Alphabander Coulter. At the heart of the leftist project, it's turned inward under

01:38:55.760 --> 01:39:00.320
intersectionality directed from one identity political group to another to create solidarity

01:39:00.320 --> 01:39:05.200
allegedly across all of the so-called marginalized identities by evoking their guilt

01:39:05.200 --> 01:39:08.880
that they're oppressed and therefore that they're ignoring the oppressions of other people

01:39:08.880 --> 01:39:13.040
and need to be more sensitive to that. And intersectionality therefore becomes the synthesis

01:39:13.040 --> 01:39:17.280
of the various otherwise competing forms of systemic oppression. So if you see critical,

01:39:17.280 --> 01:39:23.520
say race theory, queer theory, et cetera, as means to tear everything down intersectionality

01:39:23.520 --> 01:39:28.400
becomes the means to synthesize and put them back together into a new cobble together upside down

01:39:28.400 --> 01:39:33.200
pyramid hierarchy, which is exactly what people are perceiving. And that's where it lives. That's

01:39:33.200 --> 01:39:38.960
why it is intersectionality is the dialectical synthesis of all of the competing forms of

01:39:38.960 --> 01:39:44.800
so-called systemic oppression. And it gives an analytical framework allegedly for working that

01:39:44.800 --> 01:39:49.920
out and establishing a hierarchy, which is the inversion of what Patricia Collins called

01:39:49.920 --> 01:39:54.880
the matrix of domination that describes how intersectionality works. So it of course though

01:39:54.880 --> 01:39:59.520
intersectionality has to be organized this way. Why? Because the dialectic is the operating system

01:39:59.520 --> 01:40:04.880
of the left. It's driven by Alphaband just like we're about to turn to. It's been the core of

01:40:04.880 --> 01:40:11.120
progressive, therefore dialectical thought and the dialectical progressive left's project for

01:40:11.120 --> 01:40:15.920
almost 200 years. That's the point I wanted to drive home with this first half ever since Hegel

01:40:15.920 --> 01:40:22.000
unleashed it and it's an applicable form into the world. So of course intersectionality would be

01:40:22.000 --> 01:40:29.360
organized that way. So to summarize, the dialectic is the operating system of leftism and has been

01:40:29.360 --> 01:40:35.920
since the young Hegelians took it up probably in the 1820s and 30s right up through today. So 200

01:40:35.920 --> 01:40:41.760
years. Just incidentally, as an aside, the concept of manifest destiny, which is often charged by

01:40:41.760 --> 01:40:46.960
the left as being this catastrophe that destroyed Native Americans and all these lands and blah,

01:40:46.960 --> 01:40:52.400
turns out that that wasn't exactly a conservative meta-narrative. It was championed by the so-called

01:40:52.400 --> 01:40:57.200
young Democrats. The young Democrats were the American parallel to the young Hegelians. They

01:40:57.200 --> 01:41:02.720
had adopted a lot of the Hegelian progressive philosophy of the young Hegelians. These young

01:41:02.720 --> 01:41:07.840
Democrats used these ideas, including manifest destiny in the United States of the 1830s and

01:41:07.840 --> 01:41:14.480
1840s to what a lot of people see as calamity, but not necessarily. And I guess kind of as a final

01:41:14.480 --> 01:41:19.760
capstone to that line, Stephen Douglas, who famously lost the debate in the election to Abraham Lincoln,

01:41:19.760 --> 01:41:25.040
wasn't a vowed Hegelian in the young Hegelian mode as well. So just something to kind of contextualize

01:41:25.040 --> 01:41:29.760
that period of history for you. This was happening in the United States, not just Europe in terms of

01:41:29.760 --> 01:41:38.080
thought and activism. So I think I've established that the essential core of the operating system

01:41:38.080 --> 01:41:43.520
of the left is the dialectic. This has been from Hegel and the young Hegelians all the way forward

01:41:43.520 --> 01:41:49.600
through the Marxian old left, to the neo-Marxian new left, to the contemporary woke left. And this

01:41:49.600 --> 01:41:55.440
is the engine that drives all of their thought and activism, the dialectic, which draws back to Hegel.

01:41:56.400 --> 01:42:01.360
How does it work, though? The tool is called alphaben. It's a German word. It means to keep

01:42:01.360 --> 01:42:06.960
and yet to destroy at the same time. It's a very complicated term. I've talked about alphaben a

01:42:06.960 --> 01:42:11.280
little bit before. I'm going to develop alphaben here a little bit to give you an idea that Hegel

01:42:11.280 --> 01:42:15.920
himself was fascinated by this idea of alphaben, keeping and destroying. He writes in his book,

01:42:15.920 --> 01:42:20.720
The Science of Logic, or just Science of Logic, alphaben constitutes one of the most important

01:42:20.800 --> 01:42:25.840
concepts in philosophy. Alphaben, he says, has a twofold meaning in the language. On the one hand,

01:42:25.840 --> 01:42:30.800
it means to preserve, to maintain. And equally, it also means to cause disease, to put an end to.

01:42:31.760 --> 01:42:37.520
It is a delight to speculative thought, defining the language words which have in themselves

01:42:38.320 --> 01:42:43.760
a speculative meaning. This was Hegel talking about this fascination with the term alphaben.

01:42:43.840 --> 01:42:50.720
Alphaben, I'm going to make the contention, is the negation process. It is the negative process.

01:42:50.720 --> 01:42:56.160
When Hegel lays out abstract negative concrete, it is the negative process. Or in other words,

01:42:56.160 --> 01:43:01.280
it could be the antithesis process. I gave this example in a recent video that I put out.

01:43:01.280 --> 01:43:08.080
I derived this from a friend of mine on Twitter. Brilliant observation and frustration by my friend

01:43:08.080 --> 01:43:14.160
Emmy, who pointed out that she said that this is basically what you see on Twitter, but it's

01:43:14.160 --> 01:43:18.960
really more accurate to say is what you see from the dialectical aspects of Twitter. And this is a

01:43:18.960 --> 01:43:24.400
perfect example of alphaben. It's that I might say that the sky is blue, and a straight negation of

01:43:24.400 --> 01:43:29.440
that would say, no, it's not blue. Or maybe you would negate by implication by saying it's green,

01:43:29.440 --> 01:43:37.440
or it's red, or it's some other color. But an alphaben would say not at night, or maybe even

01:43:37.520 --> 01:43:42.560
not when it's raining. And so it has this feeling of deliberately missing the point. So you get to

01:43:42.560 --> 01:43:47.360
keep the blue, like you didn't actually tear down the blue, you get to keep it. But at the same time,

01:43:48.880 --> 01:43:53.680
you've abolished the concrete sense that the idea was right in the first place. So now you have to

01:43:53.680 --> 01:43:58.880
reach this synthetic view of the sky that's more complicated, that the sky is only blue during

01:43:58.880 --> 01:44:03.280
daylight hours in clear skies or something like this. This is a very good way to get a sense of

01:44:03.280 --> 01:44:07.760
how this dialectic proceeds to this concept of alphaben and what alphaben actually looks like

01:44:07.760 --> 01:44:12.880
in practice, according to the way that Hegel imagined it. This is this kind of very annoying

01:44:12.880 --> 01:44:19.360
tool that the dialectic proceeds upon. By the way, since he uses the word speculative over and over

01:44:19.360 --> 01:44:23.680
again, it's important to point out that Hegel was a speculative idealist as a type of philosopher.

01:44:24.240 --> 01:44:31.040
Speculative means looking into a mirror, speculum is a mirror in Latin, and sort of what it means.

01:44:32.000 --> 01:44:35.440
Hegel meant by being speculative or what he means as a speculative idealist is that

01:44:35.440 --> 01:44:40.480
the way to understand ideas is to reflect upon them. The purpose of reflecting upon the ideas

01:44:41.120 --> 01:44:48.080
is to recollect or remember what's already known in a very abstract sense. Really, it's also to

01:44:48.080 --> 01:44:54.480
divine the concrete from facing the idea and its negation at the same time. So alphaben in that it

01:44:54.480 --> 01:45:00.480
means keep and destroy at the same time is speculative in that it contains this place where

01:45:00.480 --> 01:45:07.440
you have the thing in its opposite reflecting back on one another at the same time. So alphaben is,

01:45:07.440 --> 01:45:13.360
in a sense, what is an autological word that is alphabening itself. I don't know my German conjugation,

01:45:13.360 --> 01:45:19.360
so we're just going to use German-English for that and say alphabening, which is totally wrong.

01:45:20.880 --> 01:45:25.120
And I don't care. Sorry, Germans. You guys can put it in the notes or whatever.

01:45:25.760 --> 01:45:31.760
So this is going to be key to moving into the trajectory of Hegel's underlying metaphysics

01:45:31.760 --> 01:45:36.000
that we'll get to in the next part of the podcast or the development of the podcast,

01:45:36.000 --> 01:45:40.560
and that is that he has this metaphysical assumption that the particular can only be

01:45:40.560 --> 01:45:44.320
understood through the whole, and speculation is going to be kind of how you're going to

01:45:44.320 --> 01:45:51.360
accomplish that. And so the recovery of the whole through a speculative thought process of reflection

01:45:51.360 --> 01:45:57.680
and recollection, remembering, is going to be able to be achieved through examining the particular

01:45:57.680 --> 01:46:03.360
and their antithesis through the dialectic. And that is the ultimate objective for Hegel of philosophy,

01:46:03.360 --> 01:46:10.480
a.k.a. reason or in German Vernunft. So this makes Hegel, we have to point this out because

01:46:10.480 --> 01:46:15.600
we're going to come back to this a bunch of times later, Hermetic. And Hermetic means an alchemist.

01:46:15.600 --> 01:46:20.960
And that's his philosophical orientation because his alchemy is achieved through the dialectic,

01:46:20.960 --> 01:46:28.720
the dialectic is like the fire that heats the contents of ideas in its alembic and gives rise

01:46:28.720 --> 01:46:34.960
to their refined or synthetic understanding. Alphabon is the process that's going on, is the

01:46:34.960 --> 01:46:40.480
way in which ideas are to be refined alchemically, kept yet destroyed. That's where Markoons is

01:46:40.480 --> 01:46:47.520
talking about peeling off the power of the current era so that the seed within can sprout.

01:46:47.520 --> 01:46:53.680
That's a Hermetic idea. Hermeticists believe, for example, that the seeds of gold exist in

01:46:53.680 --> 01:46:59.600
all the base metals. So if you can just get the base parts to peel away, then the seed of gold

01:46:59.600 --> 01:47:04.240
will sprout and blossom and the base metal will be transformed into gold. That's a Hermetic or

01:47:04.240 --> 01:47:10.320
an alchemical belief. This is actually the underlying idea of Hegelian thought. So when

01:47:10.320 --> 01:47:16.240
we say that Hegelian thought is a Hermetic or alchemical faith, that's actually what I'm talking

01:47:16.240 --> 01:47:21.440
about. And Alphabon is the tool, keep but destroy, by which it's done. And of course, it's itself

01:47:21.440 --> 01:47:27.760
so-called speculative. So it's very important to realize that what, and we'll see this later on,

01:47:28.640 --> 01:47:33.360
that what Hegel actually means by speculative is having mystical content. It's mystical. It's

01:47:33.360 --> 01:47:41.120
mysticism. Speculative means mysticism. And so this is going to open the door to a lot of things

01:47:41.120 --> 01:47:46.160
for Hegel that he already was, like Hermeticism, Alchemy, and in particular also Gnosticism,

01:47:46.160 --> 01:47:51.040
which is why all of these ideologies, like critical race theory, can be thought of as race

01:47:51.040 --> 01:47:55.040
Gnosticism, like people having a particular race because of their structurally determined lived

01:47:55.040 --> 01:48:00.400
experience, have special insight under a doctrine of standpoint epistemology that gives them the

01:48:00.400 --> 01:48:05.040
ability to understand things and have racial knowledge, etc. It gives them special knowledge.

01:48:05.040 --> 01:48:10.560
That's Gnosticism. That's racial or ethnic Gnosticism. And this is why, because the Hegelian faith is

01:48:10.560 --> 01:48:16.160
itself Gnostic, and it's open to being Gnostic because it's speculative, by which me is meant

01:48:16.160 --> 01:48:21.760
mystical. And the people who know the secret are the Gnostics. The people who understand

01:48:21.760 --> 01:48:24.960
the mysticism are the Gnostics, the ones that have the special knowledge. And that special

01:48:24.960 --> 01:48:29.920
knowledge for Hegel is defined in what he calls reason, or for nooft. So we're going to see this

01:48:29.920 --> 01:48:34.640
developed as we go on into his metaphysics. But I really just wanted to drop this here to

01:48:34.640 --> 01:48:39.120
reinforce the idea that Hegel is already thinking just in his comment on what Alphabin means,

01:48:39.120 --> 01:48:43.120
which is a very fascinating and important concept central to his dialectic. This reinforces the

01:48:43.120 --> 01:48:47.600
idea that he's thinking metaphysically and he's thinking in terms of his metaphysics alchemically

01:48:47.600 --> 01:48:52.800
or hermetically about the progression of society. This is to also say then that since he's thinking

01:48:52.800 --> 01:48:59.200
mystically and Gnostic, he's thinking religiously. And the catechism of his religion is the dialectic,

01:48:59.200 --> 01:49:04.400
which is driven by this odd concept of keeping and destroying called Alphabin in German.

01:49:04.880 --> 01:49:12.000
So as a further aside, speculative, let me just kind of like dive into this a minute further,

01:49:12.880 --> 01:49:16.800
also taps into two features that we see all the way through Hegelianism, Marxism,

01:49:16.800 --> 01:49:21.360
Neo-Marxism, and Wokism, which is that words are always given more than one meaning. We've already

01:49:21.360 --> 01:49:28.000
seen how that happens with say democracy and tolerance, for example, under Markusa. And the

01:49:28.000 --> 01:49:33.920
dialectic is how that's achieved. So you're alchemically developing a second meaning to words

01:49:33.920 --> 01:49:38.160
so that you can talk in two ways at once. The people who understand this fancy new language,

01:49:38.160 --> 01:49:43.600
the so-called initiated priests, are the Gnostics. They understand something on a deeper way. They

01:49:43.600 --> 01:49:48.640
understand in modern parlance under these ideas, the systemic way of thinking and understanding

01:49:48.640 --> 01:49:52.880
the world while everybody else understands the words and the various ideas and what's going on

01:49:52.880 --> 01:50:00.560
in another more simple way. And the other more simple way is not accessible to the Gnostic,

01:50:01.280 --> 01:50:05.920
is not accessible to the Agnostics, the people who aren't given access to this way of thinking.

01:50:05.920 --> 01:50:11.520
So alphabin becomes a kind of paradigm example, a word that means it's own opposite. But this

01:50:11.520 --> 01:50:16.160
same kind of thought was taken up later by Marx under the words, for the term, for example,

01:50:16.160 --> 01:50:20.320
science. We could do it with democracy and tolerance also as Markusa did, but democracy

01:50:20.320 --> 01:50:26.560
certainly under Marxism. But Marx used science to mean scientific socialism very frequently.

01:50:26.560 --> 01:50:32.800
He claimed that socialism itself is scientific. Wissenschaft liegt er sozialismus or something

01:50:32.800 --> 01:50:36.160
like this in German. I'm going to mess that up every time I have to say it throughout this whole

01:50:36.160 --> 01:50:40.480
thing. I think I got Wissenschaft liegt er, liqueur, right? But maybe not liqueur, liqueur,

01:50:40.480 --> 01:50:45.520
I don't know German. So the Marxism and communism that he labeled as scientific and everything

01:50:45.520 --> 01:50:51.760
else, pseudo-scientific, or really pseudo-scientific or scientific, but they actually present

01:50:51.840 --> 01:50:56.800
themselves as being scientific. So you have this reversed meaning game played through the

01:50:56.800 --> 01:51:00.560
dialectic. Communists do the same thing like we talked about before with ideas like freedom,

01:51:00.560 --> 01:51:06.320
democracy, tolerance, which they insisted require communism as a precondition, something the Neo-Marxists

01:51:06.320 --> 01:51:11.040
also argued in Markusa we saw, argued vigorously further in their day, and the Wokes still do now.

01:51:12.160 --> 01:51:17.040
We also see this tendency for so-called speculative meanings that invite Nazism and

01:51:17.040 --> 01:51:20.960
mysticism in their understanding all the way down to what everything going on in the Woke

01:51:20.960 --> 01:51:25.600
in proliferation right now. I've documented some of these in tremendous detail on the

01:51:25.600 --> 01:51:32.160
social justice encyclopedia I'm keeping on new discourses. You could talk about it within racism,

01:51:32.160 --> 01:51:37.200
meaning two things. You could talk about it in diversity, inclusion, etc., segregation,

01:51:37.200 --> 01:51:43.280
desegregation, all of these things. Decolonialization is actually colonizing the curriculum,

01:51:43.280 --> 01:51:48.240
for example. These are all key examples of the Sophistic, like Sophistry,

01:51:48.240 --> 01:51:55.520
double-speak characteristic of Hegelian ideologies, which these are actually just one

01:51:55.520 --> 01:52:03.040
genus in the broader order of Sophistry and Gnostic abuses. It's a very big picture kind of thing

01:52:03.760 --> 01:52:07.360
just to kind of drop that in there as an aside, but we can see the double-speak clearly under

01:52:07.440 --> 01:52:14.640
Alfhaven. We can turn to Lenin, who was big on Alfhaven. He was talking about sublation

01:52:14.640 --> 01:52:19.440
technically, which is a typical translation, maybe a vulgar translation of Alfhaven. He says,

01:52:19.440 --> 01:52:24.080
it means to supersede, put an end to, but simultaneously maintain and preserve. You've

01:52:24.080 --> 01:52:28.960
got this kind of double-speak there. Lenin's promoting this idea of Alfhaven. Markuza talks

01:52:28.960 --> 01:52:38.400
about it in his essay on the affirmative character of culture, which he published in

01:52:38.400 --> 01:52:44.000
Culture and Society in 1937. Herbert Markuza wrote, it is the real miracle of the affirmative culture.

01:52:44.000 --> 01:52:48.000
People can feel happy even if they are not. That's one of his big themes that people are

01:52:48.000 --> 01:52:54.960
actually miserable, but they think they're happy. I guess you can own nothing and be happy.

01:52:55.040 --> 01:52:59.440
If the culture has entered a Western thought only as an affirmative culture, the abolition

01:52:59.440 --> 01:53:03.120
of its affirmative character will act as an abolition of culture as such,

01:53:03.120 --> 01:53:09.120
where the German he wrote for abolition of culture is Alfhaven der Kultur, where Alfhaven

01:53:09.120 --> 01:53:17.600
is the noun version of Alfhaven. Alfhaven der Kultur, by the way, seeing it pop up here

01:53:17.600 --> 01:53:22.240
from Markuza in 1937, Alfhaven der Kultur is a phrase that actually arose much earlier

01:53:22.800 --> 01:53:29.280
with another communist thinker about two decades earlier, namely the enormously aggrieved

01:53:29.280 --> 01:53:33.760
Georgie Lukacz, or I guess it's just Georgie Lukacz. He's not a girl. I'm trying to get that

01:53:33.760 --> 01:53:38.880
right. We saw it as a necessary goal, Alfhaven der Kultur, the destruction of culture, the

01:53:38.880 --> 01:53:43.120
abolishment of culture, saw it as a necessary goal to achieve the kind of revolution, meaning

01:53:43.120 --> 01:53:47.680
a communist revolution that had just failed for him in Hungary. He saw that Western civilization

01:53:47.680 --> 01:53:52.400
was the problem. We had to tear down Western culture to achieve the revolutions that he was

01:53:52.400 --> 01:54:00.160
craving as a communist, and the pathway must be to destroy Western culture, Alfhaven der Kultur.

01:54:00.880 --> 01:54:05.840
And he first discussed this idea in an essay from 1920, the first time that the phrase Alfhaven

01:54:05.840 --> 01:54:10.880
der Kultur appears in the communist literature comes from 1920, and the essay's title is Who Will

01:54:10.880 --> 01:54:16.160
Save Us from Western Civilization by George Lukacz. This line of thought then Alfhaven der

01:54:16.160 --> 01:54:22.560
Kultur becomes kind of a genesis point where I've talked before where Lukacz and Antonio Gramsci

01:54:22.560 --> 01:54:27.840
and Max Horkheimer, for example, met in Vienna. I think that was in 1923. So just after this,

01:54:27.840 --> 01:54:31.360
this is obviously how they're thinking to destroy the culture. And then we have the

01:54:31.360 --> 01:54:36.240
Frankfurt School coming out of this between Lukacz and Horkheimer going back to Frankfurt.

01:54:36.240 --> 01:54:39.680
And we have Gramsci going to prison a few years later and writing the prison notebooks, which

01:54:39.680 --> 01:54:45.600
become the basis of cultural Marxism that are literally to infiltrate the cultural hegemonic

01:54:45.600 --> 01:54:50.160
sphere by entering the pillars of culture and abolishing them from within by establishing

01:54:50.160 --> 01:54:55.440
a counter hegemony, counter hegemony or a counter culture within them and having it burst out

01:54:56.240 --> 01:55:01.680
through the dialectical process. So this is where all of this kind of came from. And that,

01:55:01.680 --> 01:55:05.600
of course, redirected the goal of the Hegelian and Marxian thought that had been developing

01:55:05.600 --> 01:55:10.560
up to that point, 1920, 1926, is what we're talking about right now, toward attacking

01:55:10.560 --> 01:55:18.000
culture rather than attacking ideas or materialism, I guess, or attacking material

01:55:18.960 --> 01:55:24.880
facets of life, like economics, particularly. So as can be identified, as you could hear in the

01:55:24.880 --> 01:55:29.600
examples we gave earlier from Markuza, this has been core to the South Habendur Kulcher has been

01:55:29.600 --> 01:55:34.880
core to the leftist program more or less ever since. Their goal is to tear down Western culture,

01:55:34.880 --> 01:55:40.480
especially popular culture that makes people happy because as Markuza noted, you can be happy

01:55:40.480 --> 01:55:43.600
you can be miserable when think you're happy. He talks about this in like almost everything he

01:55:43.600 --> 01:55:47.440
writes, it's all through one dimensional man, it's in repressive tolerance, it's an essay on

01:55:47.440 --> 01:55:51.600
liberation. All these people think that they're happy, but they're really miserable. And we gotta

01:55:51.600 --> 01:55:56.240
use these critical methods to show them how miserable they are. As for Lukacs, by the way,

01:55:56.240 --> 01:56:01.760
he's not a very pleasant guy. Here's what he has to say about what Alf Haben is really about in

01:56:01.760 --> 01:56:06.560
the same essay, who will save us from Western civilization from 1920. He writes, in the last

01:56:06.560 --> 01:56:12.480
analysis, the communist social order means the alphabong of the economy as an end in itself.

01:56:13.840 --> 01:56:19.920
This is all the more true because this side of the transformation, the alphabong of the economy,

01:56:19.920 --> 01:56:25.600
as an end in itself, cannot express itself in the surface appearances of life after the seizure

01:56:25.600 --> 01:56:31.760
of power. Domination over the economy, that is what the socialist economy is, means the alphabong

01:56:31.760 --> 01:56:38.480
of the autonomy of the economy. So destroying the economy for Lukacs is the socialist end in

01:56:38.480 --> 01:56:43.680
itself. And the reason, according to Lukacs, is that it enables the seizure of power and thus

01:56:43.680 --> 01:56:49.200
the domination of the economy, thus society. And that's what the socialist economy actually is.

01:56:49.200 --> 01:56:54.720
He explicitly says that in 1920, and who will save us from Western civilization. So he advocates that

01:56:55.360 --> 01:57:02.160
all of this abolishment, this destruction be turned toward culture rather than the economy,

01:57:02.160 --> 01:57:06.960
so that the seizure of the culture of Western civilization can be accomplished.

01:57:07.600 --> 01:57:13.280
That culture can then be, Western culture can then be destroyed. That would be an end in itself,

01:57:13.280 --> 01:57:17.360
such that it will affect the seizure of power to affect domination. And that is the cultural

01:57:17.360 --> 01:57:22.480
Marxist project. That is what the leftist project has been about through the entire cultural Marxist,

01:57:22.480 --> 01:57:29.680
Neo-Marxist era, leading up at least until the very recent era. But I think that the woke is

01:57:29.680 --> 01:57:36.000
actually a continuation of this. And Alphabendir Kulcher is their project today in many serious

01:57:36.000 --> 01:57:43.520
ways. And this is Hegel's idea weaponized. Markus echoed the sentiment in an interview he did in

01:57:43.520 --> 01:57:49.040
1969 on television, remarking that he only, quote, wants to designate what has to be overcome,

01:57:49.040 --> 01:57:55.920
which in German is, I'm going to pronounce this probably, uberwunden, without entering the speculation

01:57:55.920 --> 01:57:59.840
about the end result. There's no interest in looking at the end result. We just have to designate

01:57:59.840 --> 01:58:03.680
what has to be overcome. That's where he said in the essay on liberation, if we can just tear away

01:58:04.400 --> 01:58:09.840
the problems of society, the powers of society, the injustices of society, the seed of the true

01:58:09.840 --> 01:58:13.760
better future, the liberated future will bloom and blossom and come out. This concurs with

01:58:13.760 --> 01:58:18.240
Marxist critical philosophy that didn't seek to install its own ideology at all, but rather just

01:58:18.240 --> 01:58:24.960
tear down the existing capitalist economy and figure it out from there. This is why I did a

01:58:24.960 --> 01:58:31.360
whole podcast on communism doesn't know how. It also justifies Lukacs' bad attitude in general.

01:58:31.360 --> 01:58:35.680
But generally, communism doesn't know how because it believes that the perfected society lives

01:58:35.680 --> 01:58:41.680
underneath the flaws in culture. And if you can just tear down all of the so-called bad aspects

01:58:41.680 --> 01:58:46.480
from their perspective of culture, then the perfected society will blossom out of this,

01:58:46.480 --> 01:58:53.840
will grow out of this. And this is a alchemical, a hermetic idea. So alphabander culture is the

01:58:53.840 --> 01:58:59.120
explanation for most of the Woe Clef's actions today, too. Why do we tear down statues? Why do

01:58:59.120 --> 01:59:02.960
they get dumped in lakes? Why are they being defaced? Why are they being graffitied, etc.?

01:59:02.960 --> 01:59:06.880
Because they are cultural icons that represent something about the culture. So you have to

01:59:06.880 --> 01:59:11.840
abolish the culture, alphabander culture. Why are we destroying the idea of men and women,

01:59:11.840 --> 01:59:16.480
or the worthiness of heterosexuality or having children? Why are we calling

01:59:16.480 --> 01:59:21.280
mothers birthing persons? Alphabander culture, the cultural institution of the family,

01:59:21.280 --> 01:59:25.120
is one of the five that Gramsci noted that has to be destroyed, infiltrated and destroyed.

01:59:25.120 --> 01:59:29.920
Alphabander culture. Why are we canceling Dr. Seuss and damn near every other thing?

01:59:29.920 --> 01:59:35.200
Alphabander culture. These are cultural podcasts about Dr. Seuss. These are pieces of the culture

01:59:35.200 --> 01:59:38.640
that people can relate to one another. They understand one another based on whether it's

01:59:38.640 --> 01:59:42.560
old movies, whether it's old cartoons, whether it's friends, whether the show friends, I mean,

01:59:42.560 --> 01:59:47.920
whether it's Seinfeld, whether it's Dr. Seuss, whether it's Huckleberry Finn, whatever it is.

01:59:48.480 --> 01:59:51.840
All of these things have to be abolished, whether it's to kill a Mockingbird because

01:59:51.840 --> 01:59:56.640
they are cultural touch points that let us relate to one another. So, Alphabander culture.

01:59:57.360 --> 02:00:00.320
Why are we painting Black Lives Matter on streets and putting it on the big green

02:00:00.320 --> 02:00:04.960
monster during the baseball game? Alphabander culture. Why are we changing the names of schools

02:00:04.960 --> 02:00:08.400
for people who allegedly were connected to historical evils?

02:00:09.040 --> 02:00:14.720
Alphabander culture. Why are we decolonizing the curriculum? Which is really colonizing

02:00:14.720 --> 02:00:20.480
the curriculum, by the way. Alphabander culture. Why did Ghostbusters do an all-women reboot or

02:00:20.480 --> 02:00:28.160
Star Wars Episode 7 just be an inversion remaking Episode 4? All Alphabander culture. The idea is

02:00:28.160 --> 02:00:32.960
to break down those cultural touch points and make it so that we have to now argue. We can't

02:00:32.960 --> 02:00:37.440
talk about Ghostbusters without talking about this new Ghostbusters reboot. We can't understand

02:00:37.440 --> 02:00:41.600
Episode 4 of Star Wars without having to compare it against the woke remake in Episode 7.

02:00:42.640 --> 02:00:47.520
Alphabander culture. It makes it impossible to have cultural references that are solid and universal.

02:00:48.880 --> 02:00:55.920
So, Alphabander is the tool that's like the heat in the fire. Dialectic is the fire that's

02:00:55.920 --> 02:01:04.160
boiling the alchemy to purify society, to take away all those negative pieces, to purify everything

02:01:04.160 --> 02:01:08.720
so that the seed of the perfected society as Marcuse had it can grow out. The dialectic has

02:01:08.720 --> 02:01:14.400
therefore been the operating system of leftists. In a clear line, twisting and concentrating itself

02:01:14.400 --> 02:01:18.720
all the way back at least to the young Hegelians who derived it directly from Hegel in a progressive

02:01:18.720 --> 02:01:26.080
fashion last 200 years. So, that's mission number one. I know we're almost at two hours or maybe

02:01:26.080 --> 02:01:32.480
past two hours. That's mission number one. The operating system of the left is fundamentally

02:01:32.480 --> 02:01:38.000
the dialectic, and the dialectic is credited to Hegel. But there's something more that has to

02:01:38.000 --> 02:01:42.320
be understood. This has to be understood as religious. It's not just philosophy. This is a

02:01:42.320 --> 02:01:48.160
religion. This is a faith tradition, and it's engaged in with the same intensity of a faith,

02:01:48.160 --> 02:01:52.000
and that's because Hegel had a metaphysics underneath what he was doing, and that metaphysics

02:01:52.000 --> 02:01:58.400
even through Marx and his dialectical materialism has survived. Hegel, in fact, is what's known as

02:01:58.400 --> 02:02:03.920
a theosophist, which is to say he has forwarded some religious philosophy or speculation about

02:02:03.920 --> 02:02:09.360
the nature of reality in the soul that's based on mystical insights into the nature of God. Like I

02:02:09.360 --> 02:02:15.280
said, his speculation is mysticism. We're going to back that up here in a second. For Hegel,

02:02:15.280 --> 02:02:20.640
the idea of God is what he called the absolute, or sometimes the idea or the absolute idea,

02:02:21.600 --> 02:02:27.040
which is what you get when the ideas of the world become perfected and aware of their own

02:02:27.040 --> 02:02:31.760
perfection, which is achieved through the process of the dialectic progressing history.

02:02:32.800 --> 02:02:37.600
That's the historicism that Engels prays so strongly in Hegel's philosophy,

02:02:37.600 --> 02:02:41.600
even as he complained about Hegel's dialectic itself and its inapplicability.

02:02:42.320 --> 02:02:45.760
Marx had this same idea, too, but his metaphysics was a kind of

02:02:45.760 --> 02:02:51.120
scientistic, again, not scientific materialism, which he called dialectical materialism.

02:02:51.120 --> 02:02:54.960
I'm going to mess it up again. We're going to go for the German. Wiesenschaff, Leutcher,

02:02:55.520 --> 02:03:00.880
Socialismus, scientific socialism in English at any rate, which isn't science at all.

02:03:02.480 --> 02:03:07.120
So remember what Marx had said. This is one of the first quotes that I read in this podcast,

02:03:07.120 --> 02:03:11.360
with Hegel, and I'm inserting the names a little bit for clarity, with Hegel the dialectic

02:03:11.440 --> 02:03:16.480
standing on its head. It must be turned right side up again if you would discover the rational

02:03:16.480 --> 02:03:21.760
kernel within the mystical shell. So this mysticism is key to Hegel's metaphysics.

02:03:21.760 --> 02:03:25.440
Marx thought he was getting rid of it, but he actually isn't, as we're going to uncover.

02:03:26.560 --> 02:03:33.120
So the essence of Hegel's speculative idealism is a mystical shell. It turns out, as I've been

02:03:33.120 --> 02:03:38.640
saying, a hermetic, alchemical metaphysics based in mysticism and nosticism. In other words,

02:03:38.640 --> 02:03:47.200
knowing the secrets of God or whatever. Marx rejected the mysticism, or so he thought,

02:03:47.200 --> 02:03:52.160
in favor of materialism, dialectical materialism. But because dialectical materialism, communism

02:03:52.160 --> 02:03:59.360
doesn't know how, because he retained the Hegelian drive as a very potent imaginator of new ideas

02:03:59.360 --> 02:04:03.200
in society, and he didn't know how they were going to get to communism that was just going to happen,

02:04:03.760 --> 02:04:08.240
he didn't really get away from it. He was still trying to drive the progress of history.

02:04:08.240 --> 02:04:15.280
Marx and Engels were fans of Hegel's historicism, which was predicated off of his

02:04:16.240 --> 02:04:21.040
metaphysics, and he's still trying to drive this. So Marx claimed he got rid of the mysticism

02:04:21.040 --> 02:04:28.800
through turning it into dialectical materialism, but maybe he did just enough, I guess,

02:04:28.800 --> 02:04:32.400
as a way to put it, because this is the primary reason why the US Supreme Court rejected the

02:04:32.400 --> 02:04:36.240
claim that communism or Marxism constitutes a religion. It's because this materialist,

02:04:36.240 --> 02:04:40.400
it doesn't have a God or whatever. This is despite what both the father of cultural Marxism,

02:04:40.400 --> 02:04:45.760
Antonio Gramsci, and defected Communist Party USA leader, Dr. Beladad, both had to say about it.

02:04:45.760 --> 02:04:51.360
Gramsci said, and I quote, socialism is precisely the religion that must overwhelm Christianity,

02:04:51.360 --> 02:04:56.400
with overwhelm being in the uberwunden sense that we just talked about a minute ago,

02:04:56.400 --> 02:05:01.600
had he been writing in German rather than in Italian. Beladad had it this way,

02:05:01.760 --> 02:05:09.040
she was one of the leaders of the US Communist Party, and in 1953 she testified to the House

02:05:09.040 --> 02:05:13.040
Committee on Un-American Activities, and she explained how we have to fight communism differently

02:05:13.040 --> 02:05:17.920
and what communism's ideas and goals are, and she said in that testimony that communism is like a

02:05:17.920 --> 02:05:24.080
religion. President Eisenhower said the other day, but it is religion without a God. If you

02:05:24.080 --> 02:05:28.640
believe strongly in communism, it is your duty to bring it into every phase of your life.

02:05:28.640 --> 02:05:33.280
Communism is a way of life, and it is almost like a religion. It becomes a part of you. It

02:05:33.280 --> 02:05:37.920
affects your entire thinking. It affects your attitude toward your students, toward your government,

02:05:37.920 --> 02:05:41.920
affects your attitude toward things that are happening day by day. Most communist college

02:05:41.920 --> 02:05:46.080
professors begin by being very much interested in their students, and if they have a communist

02:05:46.080 --> 02:05:55.360
philosophy, they pass it on. So communism is very much like a religion. This is one of the

02:05:55.360 --> 02:06:01.040
leaders of the Communist Party was saying in 1953. So the Marx rejected Hegel's mysticism.

02:06:03.040 --> 02:06:07.840
He had such unrealistic and largely Hegelian beliefs about how history would progress in

02:06:07.840 --> 02:06:12.960
the material world would evolve that they could be considered somewhat mystical in their own right.

02:06:12.960 --> 02:06:16.800
His communism doesn't know how. You just peel away all the problems and the perfect society

02:06:16.800 --> 02:06:22.640
will emerge. The consciousness he believed would awaken, the revolution would come,

02:06:22.720 --> 02:06:26.560
there would be the class consciousness of the proletariat, the revolution would come,

02:06:26.560 --> 02:06:31.520
proletarian revolution. The managed state economy would then emerge and take over in a

02:06:31.520 --> 02:06:35.440
state of socialism and then would eventually, through the dialectical materialist process,

02:06:35.440 --> 02:06:40.400
realize its own redundancy and a communist utopia would emerge from this as all of the,

02:06:40.400 --> 02:06:43.840
as the dialectical materialism purified all of the bad ideas out of the state.

02:06:44.560 --> 02:06:49.760
Marx was really just an applied young Hegelian. He applied young Hegelianism

02:06:50.640 --> 02:06:56.720
by dropping the overt mysticism while keeping all of the social alchemy. So the core, the alchemical

02:06:56.720 --> 02:07:03.760
core is still present in Marx and that derived from Hegel and his metaphysics, which is key to

02:07:03.760 --> 02:07:08.880
understanding what's going on. So Marx has kept alive the religious for, not just for communism,

02:07:08.880 --> 02:07:14.000
but also all of its Hegelian roots. And the Hegel for Beginners section, for example, of the Marxist

02:07:14.000 --> 02:07:19.040
Internet Archive, they write gushingly of their intellectual progenitor, meaning Hegel,

02:07:19.760 --> 02:07:24.400
who was ultimately one of Marx's inspirations. They write, reading Hegel gives one a sense that

02:07:24.400 --> 02:07:28.480
the movement of thought will coincide with a vision of harmony that awaits us at the

02:07:28.480 --> 02:07:33.520
end of the whole process, the end of history. Every serious reader of Hegel can bear witness

02:07:33.520 --> 02:07:39.280
to the intoxication of such moments, intoxication. That's exactly what I'm talking about. And this

02:07:39.280 --> 02:07:44.560
is where the communism doesn't know how. Faith based part comes in. Marx derived that from Hegel

02:07:44.560 --> 02:07:47.680
and maintained it in his own vision, which was then readily taken up by his followers and then

02:07:47.680 --> 02:07:54.480
evolved into neo-Marxism and eventually wokeism. The postmodernist kind of lost faith, if you will.

02:07:55.440 --> 02:07:59.440
The neo-Marxists, so thus the woke, have retained, like I said, this thought. They brought it back

02:07:59.440 --> 02:08:05.680
into a more mystical frame by abandoning the solid material side of this and focusing instead on

02:08:05.680 --> 02:08:12.480
culture, which I'm going to insist in Hegelian form is on geist, what Hegel called geist or spirit.

02:08:13.360 --> 02:08:18.480
This religious zeal, though, is palpable, for example, when you read Markuza talking about

02:08:18.480 --> 02:08:24.320
liberation or you read Alison Bailey talking about how she abuses her students. It's obvious in all

02:08:24.320 --> 02:08:30.320
of the major works of the 1960s from Markuza, his earlier eros and civilization, where he waxes

02:08:30.320 --> 02:08:34.560
poetic almost about how a certain sexual liberation, it's clear what he's talking about, sexual

02:08:34.560 --> 02:08:41.280
liberation freeing the eros, which is subordinated by the demands of consumer and capitalist culture

02:08:41.360 --> 02:08:46.160
to do productive work through something like the Protestant work ethic. Your sexual drives are

02:08:46.160 --> 02:08:51.200
subordinated, your id is subordinated, and rather than being able to find healthy expressions, you

02:08:51.200 --> 02:08:54.640
feel like you're happy in a society where you're not, but if you could just be liberated sexually,

02:08:54.640 --> 02:09:00.480
you'd be freefall. This is why I said before reading Markuza, at least in eros and civilization,

02:09:00.480 --> 02:09:03.600
you get the impression they just want to have orgies a lot, which when you look at them,

02:09:03.600 --> 02:09:09.520
it's totally gross. But anyway, his goal in that book was to marry Marks and Freud

02:09:09.520 --> 02:09:14.560
philosophically, and that's a forced marriage if I've ever heard of one. But all this pulls us

02:09:14.560 --> 02:09:18.880
back to Hegel again. So let's go back to Hegel and get into his metaphysical a little bit,

02:09:18.880 --> 02:09:25.280
but first his goals. Hegel really was driven very religiously, in fact, to try to create

02:09:25.280 --> 02:09:30.480
a metaphysical faith system for a Germany that wasn't going to rely on what he believed was

02:09:30.480 --> 02:09:36.080
the Orientalism, the intrusion of Christianity, which was a Middle Eastern religion unbecoming of

02:09:37.040 --> 02:09:44.080
Germanic peoples and pride. So he believed that he could develop a new metaphysical new religion

02:09:44.080 --> 02:09:49.360
and the German folk identity. And he wanted to reinstate this folk identity and his folk

02:09:49.360 --> 02:09:54.480
religion. He was also very pro-Germany. You can read that, for example, if you read where he's

02:09:54.480 --> 02:10:01.200
been analyzed by Benedict Viviano, where is written in its classic form, Hegel's philosophy of history

02:10:01.200 --> 02:10:05.840
concludes that Prussia is the present and permanent incarnation of the Holy Spirit,

02:10:05.840 --> 02:10:09.600
and that it is God's will that Prussia should conquer and govern the world,

02:10:10.480 --> 02:10:16.160
or so was understood. Such an understanding led to the First World War, I would say it probably

02:10:16.160 --> 02:10:24.720
led to the Second One too. Hitler was a Hegelian, it turns out. His trajectory was a little bit

02:10:24.720 --> 02:10:33.120
different, more kind of through the thoughts of Heidegger. But anyway, Hegel wanted to retain

02:10:33.120 --> 02:10:37.680
his metaphysics. He wanted his metaphysics to give the Germans back a sense of national identity

02:10:37.680 --> 02:10:43.520
and pride and to perfect the German state. This turned out to be expressed in a way that went

02:10:43.520 --> 02:10:48.720
pretty badly wrong at least twice in the 20th century, and that was all done on the back of

02:10:48.720 --> 02:10:55.200
broadly Hegelian projects. People who picked up Hegel led to the First and Second World Wars

02:10:55.200 --> 02:11:03.280
in their German pride. Also as a speculative idealist, coming back to that, Hegel's very centered

02:11:03.280 --> 02:11:10.320
on the ways that ideas shape society and defined, and as a result, he defined a systematic philosophy,

02:11:10.320 --> 02:11:14.160
which is not that far off from a systematic theology. Once you understand his underlying

02:11:14.160 --> 02:11:21.200
motivations or systematic theosophy, I should say, as his theosophist, that approaches how ideas are

02:11:21.200 --> 02:11:25.040
supposed to be formed, refined, understood, and eventually incorporated into society. That's his

02:11:25.040 --> 02:11:30.000
applicable side, and the dialectic was the engine. He wanted to also analyze how this is supposed

02:11:30.000 --> 02:11:35.920
to occur. Speculation and mysticism is how it was to be approached. For example, in his lectures

02:11:35.920 --> 02:11:42.800
that he gave in 1827, Hegel states, quote, As a whole, the mystical is everything speculative,

02:11:42.800 --> 02:11:47.520
or whatever is concealed from the understanding. And in his lectures on the philosophy of religion

02:11:47.520 --> 02:11:55.760
in 1824, Hegel speaks of the so-called Ellucinian mysteries, stating that the mystical is the

02:11:55.760 --> 02:12:01.360
speculative what lies within. So like I said, when he says speculative, like we saw with Alphabon,

02:12:01.360 --> 02:12:08.800
he means mystical. In the Encyclopedia Logic, Hegel writes that it should be mentioned here

02:12:08.800 --> 02:12:13.520
that the meaning of the speculative is to be understood as being the same as what is used in

02:12:13.520 --> 02:12:20.320
earlier times is called the mystical. He also states, this is kind of very important, we're

02:12:20.320 --> 02:12:26.800
going to focus on this next, that the trinity is called the mystery of God. Its content is mystical,

02:12:27.440 --> 02:12:32.640
that is speculative. This bit about the trinity is going to be really important to understanding

02:12:32.640 --> 02:12:38.160
his metaphysics as a speculative idealist who is grappling with the ideas of his time and

02:12:38.160 --> 02:12:43.760
challenging the idea of Christianity, which he saw as an Orientalist intrusion into the German

02:12:43.760 --> 02:12:49.680
folk arena. So at the center of Hegel's metaphysics then, as a speculative idealist,

02:12:49.680 --> 02:12:54.240
are the ideas of society. So we're going to lay some groundwork for this and then move into

02:12:54.240 --> 02:12:59.600
this Trinitarian thing. So in particular for him, the absolute idea, which represents the

02:12:59.600 --> 02:13:04.960
culmination and kind of actualization of all ideas in a perfected form. So let's turn back

02:13:04.960 --> 02:13:10.880
to our friends at marxist.org and we'll see that this is actually explicitly a metaphysical

02:13:10.880 --> 02:13:17.840
conception of what ideas are. So they write, the absolute idea, this is the entry on absolute idea,

02:13:17.840 --> 02:13:24.080
by the way, is both the apex and foundation of the philosophical system of Hegel. It includes

02:13:24.080 --> 02:13:29.120
all the stages of logic leading up to it, is the process of development with all of its stages and

02:13:29.120 --> 02:13:35.680
transitions. The absolute idea or world spirit, Weltgeist in German, plays the same kind of role

02:13:35.680 --> 02:13:41.840
for Hegel as a deity. Quote, history is the idea clothing itself with the form of events, that's

02:13:41.840 --> 02:13:47.600
in the philosophy of right, section 346, according to these guys at marxist.org, and they continue,

02:13:47.600 --> 02:13:52.560
and Marx rejects the need for any such concept since history is a product of people, not the other way

02:13:52.560 --> 02:13:59.920
around. Like absolute truth, knowledge of the absolute idea is an unattainable ideal, representing

02:13:59.920 --> 02:14:04.400
the whole of nature which has developed to the point where it is conscious of itself, or the

02:14:04.400 --> 02:14:09.680
concept of nature developed to such a degree of concreteness that it has returned to itself,

02:14:09.680 --> 02:14:15.600
recollected itself if you will, an absolutely comprehensive, practical, and concrete concept

02:14:15.600 --> 02:14:20.720
of the world. Hegel defines the absolute idea as the quote, unity of the theoretical idea and

02:14:20.720 --> 02:14:27.280
the practical idea. The theoretical idea is the completed notion or concrete concept of the world

02:14:27.280 --> 02:14:35.040
or object. The practical idea is the activity expressing this concept, practice. The unity of

02:14:35.040 --> 02:14:40.720
the two means fully conscious practice, people acting in true accord with their own nature.

02:14:41.520 --> 02:14:46.800
So, for whatever rejecting of Hegel's mysticism that Marx did, you can see that his instruction

02:14:46.800 --> 02:14:52.240
to wed theory to praxis, which is ran into conscious practice, praxis, that's what Marx is

02:14:52.240 --> 02:14:56.560
talking about, his instruction to wed theory to practice, which is maintained to this day in both

02:14:57.200 --> 02:15:02.080
Marxism and Neo-Marxism, and also it appears in the derived woke literature and activism,

02:15:02.080 --> 02:15:09.680
especially in critical pedagogy, education, and critical theory. These all demand that

02:15:10.560 --> 02:15:16.560
this element of social activism are present to qualify as a critical theory, and all of this

02:15:16.560 --> 02:15:20.960
is readily derived from Hegel's idea of the theoretical idea and the practical idea. Remember

02:15:20.960 --> 02:15:24.240
when I said earlier that we're going to talk about the theoretical and the practical idea? So,

02:15:24.240 --> 02:15:29.360
there's two ideas. The theoretical, there's your thesis, meeting the practical where it runs into

02:15:29.360 --> 02:15:34.000
the world, there's your antithesis, and he sees the absolute as the final synthesis of the theoretical

02:15:34.000 --> 02:15:39.600
and the practical within his dialectical framework. And for Marx, praxis is the kind of materialist

02:15:39.600 --> 02:15:45.440
manifestation where this is occurring. It is the vehicle of the dialectic. So, the metaphysical

02:15:45.440 --> 02:15:51.280
point here for Hegel is unavoidable. The absolute plays the role of deity. This is what the Marxists

02:15:51.280 --> 02:15:55.840
say about it, the whole of nature when it has developed to a point that it's conscious of itself

02:15:55.840 --> 02:16:01.360
and has so become concrete, in other words, synthetic in the dialectical language, and that it has

02:16:01.360 --> 02:16:07.760
returned to or recollected itself in speculative or mystical philosophy. So, here we can turn to

02:16:07.760 --> 02:16:13.680
the trinity and understand Hegel's views, the metaphysical spiral, as I would phrase it. So,

02:16:13.680 --> 02:16:18.320
we'll begin by talking about a letter that Hegel wrote in 1816 where he remarks, quote,

02:16:18.320 --> 02:16:23.920
I stick to this idea that the spirit of time has given the order to move forward. This order has

02:16:23.920 --> 02:16:30.000
been obeyed. This being is moving forward, irresistibly like an armored and compact phalanx,

02:16:30.560 --> 02:16:35.200
and with a movement as imperceptible as the sun's, through good and bad roads, countless

02:16:35.200 --> 02:16:39.200
light troops against him and for him flank him everywhere. So, what he's talking about here is

02:16:39.200 --> 02:16:43.520
that the idea that history or the spirit of time is moving forward irresistibly, and it's actually

02:16:43.520 --> 02:16:47.840
invincible. You can't change the course of history. It's going to do what it's going to do. It moves

02:16:47.840 --> 02:16:52.160
slowly and steadily, but like the sun, there's undeniable movement. You look now, you look later,

02:16:52.160 --> 02:16:55.920
it's clearly moved, but you'll never see it moving in any moment, unless maybe it's right

02:16:55.920 --> 02:16:59.520
along the horizon or something. And it also moves through both good and bad roads. In other words,

02:16:59.520 --> 02:17:03.120
it does things that are clearly going to be perceived as progress, and it's going to do

02:17:03.120 --> 02:17:07.360
things that are not perceived as progress, but they still count as progress because this is the

02:17:07.360 --> 02:17:11.920
progress of history. And it's going to be carried along by countless light troops, some of which

02:17:12.000 --> 02:17:16.400
are for and some of which are against. So, you're going to have people arguing on both sides of

02:17:16.400 --> 02:17:20.400
what they believe is the right direction of history. So, it could be that you have this great

02:17:20.400 --> 02:17:23.760
leader that people are supporting, and he's not actually doing a great job, or you could have

02:17:23.760 --> 02:17:29.200
this horrific dictator, and people oppose this person, but this is just the march of history,

02:17:29.200 --> 02:17:34.400
according to how Hegel conceived. And this is for him how the absolute, this perfect thing,

02:17:34.400 --> 02:17:41.280
moves along through an arc of time called history. And the goal is that the absolute is going to

02:17:41.280 --> 02:17:46.320
use the unfolding of history to come to understand itself, and in the instant the absolute understands

02:17:46.320 --> 02:17:51.200
itself as the absolute, history will end. In other words, we'll hit what you might call the

02:17:51.200 --> 02:17:58.000
eschaton, the end of the world in kind of a kind of religious language. It's important to realize

02:17:58.000 --> 02:18:02.160
though that Hegel's thinking endlessly in triads, just like his dialectic. You have thesis,

02:18:02.160 --> 02:18:06.880
antithesis, synthesis, technically I guess that's Kant's, which you have abstract negative concrete,

02:18:06.880 --> 02:18:11.360
these triads. You have objective spirit, subjective spirit, absolute spirit, theorist,

02:18:11.360 --> 02:18:16.160
theory, practice, and their synthesis in what Marx called praxis, which is theoretically driven

02:18:16.160 --> 02:18:21.120
activism, which Pauline Christians would probably call evangelism. So, when Marx says that we have

02:18:21.120 --> 02:18:25.040
to have theory wetted to praxis, what he's actually saying is you have to be an evangelist on behalf

02:18:25.040 --> 02:18:30.080
of Marxism, and do activism, which would be the kinds of things that Christians tend to do like

02:18:30.080 --> 02:18:36.480
tending to the poor and acting in charity. But two other big triads we have to focus on are

02:18:36.720 --> 02:18:41.840
for Hegel are being and nothing. There's your thesis in antithesis, being and nothing,

02:18:41.840 --> 02:18:48.480
and his synthesis there, or the concrete, is becoming. Being, nothing, and becoming form a

02:18:48.480 --> 02:18:56.880
Hegelian synthetic triad. Being, nothing, and becoming. And then another is ideas, nature,

02:18:56.880 --> 02:19:01.600
and geist. In other words, the ideas, the natural world as it manifests in the spirit.

02:19:02.400 --> 02:19:07.040
So, these last two triads become crucial to understanding Hegelian metaphysics.

02:19:07.040 --> 02:19:10.720
This is because he had to grapple with, he had these because in particular he was grapple,

02:19:10.720 --> 02:19:14.880
I mean, being and nothing are pretty fundamental philosophical concepts, but they're also important

02:19:14.880 --> 02:19:19.680
if you're looking even in the Judeo-Christian context. But certainly, the idea of these kind

02:19:19.680 --> 02:19:22.640
of trinities is very important to grapple with, if he's going to grapple with the

02:19:24.480 --> 02:19:29.600
Christian trinity and make sense of it, as he wanted to, because he wanted to synthesize

02:19:29.600 --> 02:19:34.800
out of the Orientalist Christian imposition, which was an antithesis for him to the German

02:19:34.800 --> 02:19:40.800
folk religion, and create a new metaphysics, a new systematic theosophy for the German folk

02:19:40.800 --> 02:19:46.320
religion that he hoped for. He wanted to understand in particular, because he was kind of a monist,

02:19:46.320 --> 02:19:50.960
in a sense. He wanted to understand in particular how Christianity was just manifest, one narrow

02:19:52.000 --> 02:19:59.440
manifestation of a more complete picture, what would have been called in the old Hermetic tradition,

02:19:59.440 --> 02:20:05.200
a Prisket theologica, a pristine theology, if you will, or a primordial theology,

02:20:06.160 --> 02:20:10.960
or he was also interested in the development, the absolute would actually be representative of

02:20:10.960 --> 02:20:16.480
what would be called a philosophia perennis. And that was his goal, was to get back to,

02:20:16.480 --> 02:20:21.120
to recollect the philosophia perennis, the perennial philosophy. That's the perfect

02:20:21.120 --> 02:20:27.040
expression of philosophy that's held up in the, or exists in, I should say, the absolute.

02:20:27.600 --> 02:20:30.960
So these are both big ideas that we're going to come back to later as well. But the general idea

02:20:30.960 --> 02:20:36.560
here, just to kind of summarize this, that Prisket theologia is a, is a Hermetic concept,

02:20:36.560 --> 02:20:41.920
in other words, an alchemy concept, that there's some primordial or pristine original theology,

02:20:41.920 --> 02:20:45.680
that all of the world's faiths and philosophies lend partial insight to. They're like

02:20:46.240 --> 02:20:50.080
fragmented. You can imagine, like, there's one true faith, and it's like a mirror,

02:20:50.080 --> 02:20:54.240
and it's been smashed. And, you know, all the pieces are on the ground, and they're reflecting

02:20:54.320 --> 02:20:57.760
different parts. And this one's reflecting Christianity, and this one's reflecting

02:20:57.760 --> 02:21:01.040
Buddhism, and this one's reflecting Islam, and this one's reflecting Judaism, and this one's

02:21:01.040 --> 02:21:05.840
reflecting Jainism, and whatever. And they're all lending partial insight to the real thing.

02:21:05.840 --> 02:21:10.960
But if they could just be made to converge, then you can get to that original, one true

02:21:10.960 --> 02:21:17.040
theology, the Prisket theologia. And the alchemy, alchemy is how that's done, because the fragments

02:21:17.040 --> 02:21:22.240
of this true philosophy appear in all of these junky worldly forms, base metal forms. If you

02:21:22.240 --> 02:21:28.080
could just purify, you could get the seeds of the true philosophy, the original philosophy,

02:21:28.080 --> 02:21:31.840
the primordial philosophy to sprout out of this, then you could get back to this

02:21:31.840 --> 02:21:39.520
Prisket theologia through an alchemical convergence of the various different faiths of the world,

02:21:39.520 --> 02:21:46.800
for example. You could also reach, if he's more interested, Prisket theologia has this ancient,

02:21:47.360 --> 02:21:56.160
old, gone primordial aspect to it. Philosophia parenis has a different kind of eternal, and that's

02:21:56.160 --> 02:21:59.920
where his absolute really was. And that's what he's really interested in. He's using the Prisket

02:21:59.920 --> 02:22:06.800
theologia as a model, this idea that he took out of the Hermetic literature as a model to get toward

02:22:06.800 --> 02:22:11.680
this perennial philosophy, which is what the absolute actually is. And that'll be able to

02:22:11.680 --> 02:22:16.240
be recovered or recollected alchemically from the various faiths and philosophies of the world

02:22:16.240 --> 02:22:20.320
by means of his speculative approach and systematic philosophy. Ultimately, what he calls

02:22:21.520 --> 02:22:27.840
translated as reason, he calls Vernunft, which we're also going to spend some time on that later,

02:22:27.840 --> 02:22:35.520
and I point to pronouncing it as Vernunft. I'm working on it, my German. So to kind of drive home

02:22:35.520 --> 02:22:40.480
this is all still very metaphysical for Hegel, very religious. Hegel has it in his lectures in

02:22:40.560 --> 02:22:48.160
the philosophy of religion. Philosophy is only explicating itself when it explicates religion,

02:22:48.160 --> 02:22:52.640
and when it explicates itself, it is explicating religion. So for him, philosophy, in other words,

02:22:52.640 --> 02:22:57.040
reason is religious. He goes on to say the trinity to draw back to that trinity because we're looking

02:22:57.040 --> 02:23:03.280
at these triads that he's interested in for his dialectic, et cetera, and some of these key examples.

02:23:03.280 --> 02:23:08.560
The trinity is called the mystery of God. Its content is mystical, i.e. speculative. These are

02:23:08.560 --> 02:23:13.840
two things that Hegel says in his lectures on the philosophy of religion. So now we can take

02:23:13.840 --> 02:23:18.320
a closer look at the way that Hegel would conceive of the trinity, and I want to focus. We could

02:23:18.320 --> 02:23:23.840
talk about, and I will briefly, let me talk about being nothing and becoming. We're going to come

02:23:23.840 --> 02:23:31.120
back to the idea of becoming, but being God is I am the I am. It is being, and it is in contrast to

02:23:31.120 --> 02:23:35.280
the great philosophical question of why is there something rather than nothing. So being is contrast

02:23:35.280 --> 02:23:40.240
to nothing, and he says that becoming is the resolution, the synthesis of understanding this

02:23:40.240 --> 02:23:45.440
mystery. But he has this other trinity that he's very interested in, which is idea, nature, and

02:23:45.440 --> 02:23:53.040
spirit, or geist. So as an idealist, he's centered on the ideas of society. The reason is how you

02:23:53.040 --> 02:23:58.800
engage with them, or reason itself is the expression of the ideas. These take the place of God the

02:23:58.800 --> 02:24:04.080
Father as the absolute, as we've already heard from the Marxists. The natural world for him then

02:24:04.080 --> 02:24:10.800
becomes like the manifestation of this on earth, and so it's like the Son, or Jesus. But the natural

02:24:10.800 --> 02:24:16.240
world is disordered in and of itself, and is not that interesting for somebody like Hegel who's

02:24:16.240 --> 02:24:22.640
putting forth a systematic philosophy. And so Hegel has this statement, the state is the divine idea

02:24:22.640 --> 02:24:29.360
as it is expressed on earth. So the state becomes, in this Trinitarian metaphor, the Son. So you have

02:24:29.360 --> 02:24:35.360
the ideas are the Father, the state becomes the Son, and geist or spirit are the various

02:24:35.360 --> 02:24:41.760
normativities of culture in some sense. Those are indicative of the Holy Spirit. So his trinity

02:24:41.760 --> 02:24:49.680
become the ideas, the state, and the spirit of the world as they're developing. But he does not

02:24:49.680 --> 02:24:53.760
have a Christological understanding of this, or a Christian understanding of this, I guess I should

02:24:53.760 --> 02:24:59.840
say. Christianity holds these things, Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, to be co-eternal as three aspects

02:24:59.840 --> 02:25:09.040
of one eternal and perfect Godhead. God which manifests in the Word as the Logos of John becomes

02:25:09.040 --> 02:25:15.040
flesh in the world in Christ, and the Holy Spirit is that which is God moving within and through

02:25:15.040 --> 02:25:20.640
the world. And these things are co-eternal. They are one thing as three things. And this is how the

02:25:20.720 --> 02:25:25.680
Christian metaphysic understands it. This isn't how Hegel sees it, because Hegel sees things

02:25:25.680 --> 02:25:32.800
in a process-oriented or evolutionary-oriented fashion. Specifically, Hegel believes that God,

02:25:34.240 --> 02:25:40.000
when you talk about God, that's God merely in himself, or God in potentia as an abstract,

02:25:40.720 --> 02:25:47.680
as a Logos, or as a reason. And that's insufficient to be truly a deity, because the absolute to be

02:25:47.680 --> 02:25:53.520
complete would have to not just be abstract, which is the beginning of His dialectical process,

02:25:53.520 --> 02:25:59.760
but be concrete. So God cannot merely be abstract. He has to be concrete. So He has to meet His

02:25:59.760 --> 02:26:07.840
negative and then come to synthesis in order to be completed. So this is a fundamental contradiction,

02:26:07.840 --> 02:26:12.800
or creates a fundamental contradiction for Hegel in the site for his dialectic, because a God that

02:26:12.800 --> 02:26:18.560
is abstract is not concrete, and a God that is concrete is not abstract. So there's our contradiction.

02:26:18.560 --> 02:26:23.600
So a synthesis will be needed to reconcile these. And that synthesis is the realized absolute. And

02:26:23.600 --> 02:26:28.800
here's where we come back to being nothing and becoming, is the absolute who becomes absolute,

02:26:29.680 --> 02:26:38.480
only by his realization of himself as a synthetic to both abstraction as an idea and worldly concreteness.

02:26:38.880 --> 02:26:48.640
So which is expressed in nature, and then nature as regulated by the state, which is the divine

02:26:48.640 --> 02:26:55.120
idea expressed on earth. He also sees God as imminent in the world. So this is kind of a

02:26:55.120 --> 02:27:01.920
panentheist view rather than a traditional Christian view. God is not transcendent to the

02:27:01.920 --> 02:27:07.200
world for Hegel. Hegel's view is that these three things, the idea or nature in the state,

02:27:07.200 --> 02:27:12.880
and then geist, are so-called moments of the concept. Moments are things that can't be reduced.

02:27:12.880 --> 02:27:17.360
So if I had a puzzle, for example, I could take all the pieces apart and you could say,

02:27:17.360 --> 02:27:21.680
here's all these pieces, and I could take it apart. But if I have something like color,

02:27:21.680 --> 02:27:27.600
which is constructed of hue and shade and saturation or whatever, I can't take those

02:27:27.600 --> 02:27:31.760
things apart and still have the color. I can't take a color apart, but it has these different

02:27:31.760 --> 02:27:35.920
components. So a moment is like a thing that has components that can't be taken apart.

02:27:36.880 --> 02:27:41.760
And so these things are moments of the concept. The concept is kind of this key thing at the

02:27:41.760 --> 02:27:47.120
center of his metaphysics, and he compares this to the alchemical elements of mercury, sulfur,

02:27:47.120 --> 02:27:51.200
and salt because he's actually an alchemist. And he does this while outlining a systematic

02:27:51.200 --> 02:27:56.160
philosophy that uses the dialectic to negate each of these moments and allow for it to give rise to

02:27:56.160 --> 02:28:01.040
the next, so that the spirit as absolute might eventually bloom. This is where you have that

02:28:01.040 --> 02:28:05.440
idea, like the absolute is like the seed. It's contained within all of this, and we can just

02:28:05.440 --> 02:28:10.160
peel away all of the bad idea, all the bad parts, the imperfected parts of the idea,

02:28:11.280 --> 02:28:19.520
then the ideal or perfected spirit, the absolute, the veldgeist might bloom. And this is just like

02:28:19.520 --> 02:28:25.280
alchemists hold that gold is believed to bloom from its seeds that are contained in every base

02:28:25.280 --> 02:28:30.000
metal and other materials. It's just like Markuza believed that liberation exists,

02:28:30.000 --> 02:28:35.040
like a seed inside of a corrupted society, that if we could just figure out how to do alphabe

02:28:35.040 --> 02:28:41.680
into it correctly so that we could keep that seed while tearing away the rest of the junk,

02:28:41.680 --> 02:28:47.280
then it would be able to blossom and take off. So for Hegel, this is his metaphysics. Again,

02:28:47.280 --> 02:28:52.160
the ideas take earthly form in nature and in the world, and they're managed under the concept of

02:28:52.160 --> 02:28:57.520
the state. So the divine idea expresses itself through the state. So an inclination towards

02:28:57.520 --> 02:29:02.640
statism in Hegelian philosophy has a metaphysical imperative. It's not only obvious, but has a

02:29:02.640 --> 02:29:07.840
metaphysical imperative. The state in turn then sets the material conditions for society, which

02:29:07.840 --> 02:29:12.000
gives rise to how people live. It gives rise to the spirit that they live under, or in other words,

02:29:12.000 --> 02:29:16.960
the culture, which we'll call the geist of that nation or society or the world, maybe,

02:29:16.960 --> 02:29:21.360
when it's all perfected and it's the world, and it will be the veldgeist. And this is where the

02:29:21.360 --> 02:29:27.760
goal is to try to head to. The geist then in turn, though, because each moment negates the previous.

02:29:27.760 --> 02:29:32.720
The geist is then going to be able to refine how the prevailing ideas, the philosophy, using the

02:29:32.720 --> 02:29:38.400
dialectic and alphabe, by finding the contradictions in that new structure. The ideas are coming down,

02:29:38.400 --> 02:29:43.680
the state is implementing them, the culture that arises, and things still aren't perfect,

02:29:43.680 --> 02:29:48.000
and the people in the culture are going to start discovering the problems. And so the geist is

02:29:48.000 --> 02:29:52.480
then going to take the next level of refining, and the more conscious they are, the more consciousness

02:29:52.480 --> 02:29:56.240
they have, the more ability they're going to have to refine these ideas. And that's going to give

02:29:56.240 --> 02:30:01.600
rise to a new iteration of improved ideas, allowing this process to repeat. So we no longer have this

02:30:01.600 --> 02:30:06.720
kind of eternal God that is Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. We now have this ideas as God,

02:30:07.520 --> 02:30:16.320
state as Son, and geist or culture as spirit. And rather than just being three in one, we now have

02:30:16.320 --> 02:30:21.920
this kind of spiraling process where one gives rise to an improved version of the past, of the

02:30:21.920 --> 02:30:26.080
next, or whatever, or of the previous, I should say. So we have this spiraling through history,

02:30:26.080 --> 02:30:32.400
where a new improved state follows from the new improved ideas, usually, as Hegel had it,

02:30:32.400 --> 02:30:37.200
through the activity of a man of action that is being used by history, which has its talos of

02:30:37.200 --> 02:30:41.600
purpose to it. And this is going to create new conditions, and that's a new geist, which is,

02:30:41.600 --> 02:30:45.600
in a sense, a new culture. And that's going to start the process all over again. So you have this

02:30:45.760 --> 02:30:52.800
spiraling through history of ideas, state, spirit, improving as they go along the trajectory of

02:30:52.800 --> 02:30:58.320
history. That's Hegelian metaphysics. So in a sense, the Trinity is not transcendent and eternal,

02:30:58.320 --> 02:31:04.720
it's imminent, and it's a process. It isn't, it's becoming. It isn't perfect, it's perfectable,

02:31:04.720 --> 02:31:08.960
and perfecting through the process of history. In other words, it's heading toward the emergence

02:31:08.960 --> 02:31:13.680
or the recollection of that philosophy, Perennis, the Perennial philosophy, by speculatively,

02:31:13.680 --> 02:31:20.560
which is, say, mystically trying to recollect the Priska Theologia. This is a very alchemical

02:31:20.560 --> 02:31:25.920
approach to this Trinity. This is Hegel's philosophy on this. Philosophy is how this is

02:31:25.920 --> 02:31:31.200
going to be done for Hegel, reason, for an umpt. Because that's how the geist informs the philosophers

02:31:31.200 --> 02:31:36.400
to improve the ideas, and the process that Hegel recommends to do this is the dialectic, which

02:31:36.400 --> 02:31:40.640
is through seeking those contradictions, but while keeping that essential core. In other words,

02:31:40.640 --> 02:31:47.040
Alfhaben. The reason for this is ultimately the alchemy, the Hermeticism that he based a lot of

02:31:47.040 --> 02:31:51.600
his thought on, because he was an alchemist. It's also because he's a Gnostic, and he believed

02:31:51.600 --> 02:31:56.640
that his ideas of reason were higher, and they understood things better. So for Hegel, though,

02:31:56.640 --> 02:32:00.480
the Godhead isn't a thing that is in the world, or is transcendent to the world, I should say,

02:32:00.480 --> 02:32:05.840
but merely is, it's a process that spirals through and creates history as it goes. Again,

02:32:05.840 --> 02:32:10.240
ideas give rise to a state. Father begets son. This creates conditions for a spirit

02:32:10.800 --> 02:32:15.280
that then flows back into the Father, which is now more self-aware than it was before,

02:32:15.280 --> 02:32:19.040
and this unfolding of history and refinement of ideas are one and the same.

02:32:20.240 --> 02:32:26.320
For Hegel, this deity is absolute spirit, or the absolute, or the absolute idea. It is the

02:32:26.320 --> 02:32:30.800
ultimate synthesis of all of the subjective spirit and objective spirit through the dialectical

02:32:30.800 --> 02:32:37.120
process. It's the synthesis of the theoretical and the practical. It is what happens when the

02:32:37.120 --> 02:32:47.120
abstract God meets his negation in the worldly squalor and is synthesized into the absolute,

02:32:48.960 --> 02:32:54.320
into something that is becoming absolute, I really should say, into becoming, so being nothing

02:32:55.200 --> 02:33:01.360
and becoming. So while the absolute is always the absolute and the Hegelian metaphysic,

02:33:01.360 --> 02:33:04.960
the deal is that the absolute doesn't know that it's absolute until its ideas are perfected.

02:33:04.960 --> 02:33:13.280
So God isn't God until God, God isn't God if he's just an idea, if he's just transcendent. God has

02:33:13.280 --> 02:33:19.520
to be in the world and also transcendent, and that has to be synthesized. So that's what the absolute

02:33:19.520 --> 02:33:26.000
is. It has to be a God that is out of the world and in the world and simultaneously aware of itself

02:33:26.000 --> 02:33:31.840
as such. That synthesis has to arrive, and the name for that synthesis is the absolute.

02:33:31.840 --> 02:33:36.800
And when that occurs, the so-called ideas of the society, thus the state that flows from it, thus

02:33:36.800 --> 02:33:40.320
the spirit of the people, are all going to be perfected. And that's what Marx thought would be

02:33:40.320 --> 02:33:45.600
the communist state, or that's what Marcuse thinks is liberation. That's what you see when you talk

02:33:45.600 --> 02:33:49.520
about black liberation. That's what you see when you hear people talking about racial justice

02:33:49.520 --> 02:33:54.640
or racial liberation or whatever liberation they're all talking about today in the woke thing.

02:33:54.640 --> 02:33:59.600
So God for Hegel doesn't become God until God realizes that he's God, which is required,

02:33:59.600 --> 02:34:08.080
or which occurs only after God makes creation as a dialectical other to himself to compare

02:34:08.080 --> 02:34:12.000
himself against, and the process unfolds itself all the way until the plurennial

02:34:12.080 --> 02:34:17.760
philosophy is remembered as a result. That's, I guess, very complicated, but it kind of

02:34:17.760 --> 02:34:22.000
bounced back to Judeo-Christianity to make it more simple. The Judeo-Christian metaphysic

02:34:22.000 --> 02:34:27.120
God is. I am the I am. I am the often the Omega, the thing that is before, beginning and after the

02:34:27.120 --> 02:34:33.760
end, eternal, perfect, etc. God creates the world because it is his will as the creator to do so.

02:34:34.320 --> 02:34:40.960
And the Hegelian metaphysics God as absolute becomes rather than is through a process of

02:34:42.960 --> 02:34:48.160
having the world and reflecting himself against the world and refining in that process the ideas

02:34:48.160 --> 02:34:53.680
of the world via that above described spiral process. So the absolute becomes truly absolute

02:34:53.680 --> 02:35:00.880
only when it is both abstract and concrete and realizes itself to be such, and thus it becomes

02:35:00.960 --> 02:35:05.520
the absolute. It realizes itself as the absolute, or it actualizes itself, realizes itself for the

02:35:05.520 --> 02:35:12.160
words that you often see around this. So this absolute then becomes the last idea to be perfected.

02:35:13.600 --> 02:35:20.160
The realization that God realizing himself is the last idea to be perfected. So a God that

02:35:20.160 --> 02:35:24.880
everything's perfect except he doesn't realize that everything's perfect yet is the last step

02:35:24.880 --> 02:35:30.240
before the perfected God. So that last idea to be perfected is God realizing himself as God.

02:35:30.240 --> 02:35:36.160
So God realizing himself as God becomes the final perfected idea after which time the ideas become

02:35:36.160 --> 02:35:40.000
perfect and again the state becomes perfect so the spirit and culture become perfect and history

02:35:40.000 --> 02:35:49.040
reaches its end and utopia begins. And that is the Hegelian historicist metaphysic that is driven

02:35:49.040 --> 02:35:57.200
through the alchemical method of dialectic that burns off or tears away the incorrect ideas,

02:35:57.200 --> 02:36:03.200
the failures of history, the things that have to be taken apart via the process of alphaben which

02:36:03.200 --> 02:36:11.040
is to destroy and yet keep. So Hegel frames this out roughly as God creating in the world itself

02:36:11.040 --> 02:36:18.720
as some other to itself as an abstract idea. So now you have the abstract God creates a negation,

02:36:18.720 --> 02:36:24.480
the negative, the other which is the world by which he will be able to know himself that is

02:36:24.480 --> 02:36:28.240
through hermetic theosophy, that is the definition of hermetic theosophy,

02:36:28.240 --> 02:36:34.960
that God requires the world to realize that he's God and that is the heart of the Hegelian thought.

02:36:34.960 --> 02:36:41.600
This perfect being, so the absolute represents or the deity represents a perfect being say that he

02:36:41.600 --> 02:36:47.280
doesn't know that he's perfect. So he creates this imperfect world, so that's the Prisket theologia for

02:36:47.280 --> 02:36:51.840
example would be the theology that understands that God. So he creates this imperfect world

02:36:51.840 --> 02:36:55.840
as an antithesis to his own perfection and then through the process of dialectical synthesis

02:36:55.840 --> 02:37:00.720
which will be carried out by philosophers, politicians, so-called men of action who are

02:37:00.720 --> 02:37:04.800
summoned by history for the purpose of driving the theosophy history, he will eventually be

02:37:04.800 --> 02:37:09.840
able to be made aware of himself as absolute. The philosophers and so on drive this because they

02:37:09.840 --> 02:37:14.160
are the ones who work with the ideas and exist within the spirit or the geist, the culture,

02:37:14.160 --> 02:37:20.560
the national or world level be that a national geist or a world geist,

02:37:20.560 --> 02:37:27.040
Weltgeist in German. But again, ultimately this is alchemy, this is hermeticism. It means a lot

02:37:27.040 --> 02:37:31.760
more specifically if we get into what hermeticism is really about, but the root of hermeticism is

02:37:31.760 --> 02:37:36.640
the belief that God requires creation to be God and that he learns that he is God through his

02:37:36.640 --> 02:37:43.920
creation. This is a complete rejection of the Christian metaphysics where God is, God is transcendent

02:37:43.920 --> 02:37:48.560
and God doesn't need his creation, he created it because he wanted to. It was his will.

02:37:50.080 --> 02:37:56.160
Hegel the alchemist applies his alchemical thoughts to metaphysics and what arises is his view of

02:37:56.160 --> 02:38:01.280
phenomenology and ultimately the dialectic that's supposed to drive this. This is why what we're

02:38:01.280 --> 02:38:05.680
dealing with, with the woke, with the neo-Marxists, less with the postmodernists, they get complicated

02:38:05.680 --> 02:38:10.720
because they were despairing, they lost the faith. With the Marxists before them, with the young

02:38:10.720 --> 02:38:15.600
Hegelians before them, that's why what we see is this long 200-year-long religion that's manifesting

02:38:15.600 --> 02:38:21.280
in different ways and it's all the Hegelian metaphysics applied to basically create the

02:38:21.280 --> 02:38:26.400
perfected society by a bunch of, frankly, megalomaniacs who think that they know how to do it,

02:38:26.400 --> 02:38:32.560
they know what the perfect society looks like and they try to approach it. So with Marx and later

02:38:32.560 --> 02:38:37.760
the neo-Marxists, they're not as up on all this mysticism, all this alchemy in the specific sense,

02:38:37.760 --> 02:38:42.480
maybe with the exception of Walter Benjamin, he's an early Frankfurt school guy who was actually a

02:38:42.480 --> 02:38:46.800
Jewish mystic. He maybe is an important exception, but most of them weren't that deep into the

02:38:46.800 --> 02:38:51.600
mysticism. Marx certainly wasn't deep into the mysticism unless you want to try to classify him

02:38:51.600 --> 02:38:58.960
as a Satanist, which there are Marx quotes that would support that. But anyway, none of this

02:39:01.120 --> 02:39:05.440
deeper engine of Hegel though, despite the fact that they get rid of the so-called mystical shell

02:39:05.440 --> 02:39:09.360
to get to that kernel, that's what Marx was talking about. None of the engine really goes away.

02:39:09.360 --> 02:39:15.920
The dialectical process, a lot of the alchemical belief is still presently there. Marx reframed

02:39:15.920 --> 02:39:20.720
things in a material way. He talked about ideology, superstructure, and society. Well,

02:39:20.720 --> 02:39:27.120
there's your ideas, state, and spirit. These are echoes that persist all the way down. For

02:39:27.120 --> 02:39:31.440
example, in Critical Race Theory today, we have white supremacy as the ideology that gives rise

02:39:31.440 --> 02:39:37.680
to a systemic racism superstructure of society that thus creates an inequitable society and a

02:39:38.560 --> 02:39:43.040
imperfect spirit. And the critical race consciousness, like Marx's class consciousness,

02:39:43.840 --> 02:39:47.680
is to be awakened by the critical race theorists, and that will lead people to challenge this

02:39:47.680 --> 02:39:51.120
existing status quo through a dialectical process that we heard from many black feminists and

02:39:51.120 --> 02:39:56.880
critical race theorists already. That will result in a revolution at the level of culture,

02:39:56.880 --> 02:40:01.120
a cultural revolution, whereas that had ever been tried before, that eventually brings equity

02:40:01.120 --> 02:40:06.880
and racial justice, and it's going to refine the ideology out of white supremacy. And the

02:40:06.880 --> 02:40:13.440
ideology will therefore give rise to a not systemically racist superstructure, and we enter

02:40:13.440 --> 02:40:19.360
into a post-racial utopia. And that's really what the goal of Critical Race Theory is, but it has no

02:40:19.360 --> 02:40:24.240
clear objective to get there. But this is all exactly the same idea as whether you want to

02:40:24.240 --> 02:40:28.080
point to Hegel, or you want to point to Marx, whether you want to point to Marcuse, all a new

02:40:28.080 --> 02:40:35.360
packaging, same operating system, new computer. So that this is all alchemical then for Hegel,

02:40:35.360 --> 02:40:41.680
and metaphysical is quite clear that it's state alchemical, I don't think I've really established,

02:40:41.680 --> 02:40:47.120
going into like neo-Marxism and wokeism, other than to point out that Marx believed that the

02:40:47.120 --> 02:40:50.960
awakening of class consciousness would move the proletariat to advance history to its

02:40:50.960 --> 02:40:56.000
communistic end. Liberal capitalism would therefore give way to statist socialism and

02:40:56.000 --> 02:41:00.800
eventually resolve in, as Marcuse had it many years later, a society that presently exists

02:41:00.800 --> 02:41:08.320
nowhere on earth. In other words, something that isn't derived from which is, in that case, perfected

02:41:08.320 --> 02:41:14.880
communism. So in other words, communism is supposed to be the end point here. So it's no

02:41:14.880 --> 02:41:19.360
surprise that the neo-Marxists understood and adopted this ultimately alchemical form as well.

02:41:19.360 --> 02:41:22.560
So we can turn back to let's look at their literature. We'll find some.

02:41:23.440 --> 02:41:26.240
Horkheimer and Adorno, we mentioned the dialectic of enlightenment. And by the way,

02:41:26.240 --> 02:41:29.840
this is the first time the word dialectic appears in that text, other than in the title.

02:41:31.200 --> 02:41:35.200
They're talking about dialectical thinking, and it's given as the kind of thinking, quote,

02:41:35.200 --> 02:41:42.400
in which each thing is what it is only by becoming what it is not. That's alchemy. Another good

02:41:42.400 --> 02:41:47.360
example that this alchemical thinking is still going on appears in Marcuse's repressive tolerance.

02:41:48.080 --> 02:41:52.160
Tolerance is only truly tolerance by becoming intolerant. We see it also

02:41:52.160 --> 02:41:57.600
where freedom is only truly free if you limit freedom for certain people, at least.

02:41:58.160 --> 02:42:02.800
Democracy is only truly democratic when the people with the wrong ideas are disenfranchised,

02:42:02.800 --> 02:42:07.680
maybe even lose suffrage. Critical thinking is only truly critical thinking when it adopts a

02:42:07.680 --> 02:42:13.120
critical consciousness or in critical race theory, a space is only desegregated when it is segregated

02:42:13.120 --> 02:42:17.680
so that it can get away from that structurally deterministic force of racism that's a super

02:42:17.680 --> 02:42:22.400
structure of society. This is on the rationale that a space can therefore only be deracialized

02:42:22.400 --> 02:42:26.560
by intentionally racializing it, as we saw in Kimberly Crenshaw's Mapping the Margins,

02:42:26.560 --> 02:42:31.280
where she advocates that there's a fundamental difference between saying I am black and I am

02:42:31.280 --> 02:42:35.520
a person who happens to be black. We have to racialize specifically to fight against the

02:42:35.520 --> 02:42:39.680
imposition of race that's already present. So we have to racialize to deracialize. And again,

02:42:39.680 --> 02:42:45.360
we see this doublespeak. This is all alchemy. Again, Horkheimer and Adorno, dialectical thinking

02:42:45.920 --> 02:42:50.880
is the kind of thinking in which each thing is what it is only by becoming what it is not.

02:42:51.840 --> 02:42:57.200
Lead turns to gold. It's still alchemy. Of course, let's be fair. I mentioned Theodore

02:42:57.200 --> 02:43:01.920
Adorno in the dialectic of Enlightenment earlier. He criticizes this exactly this idea. I tell you,

02:43:01.920 --> 02:43:06.960
he turned kind of post-Marxist by this thing 20 years later in 1966. He seeks to recover the

02:43:06.960 --> 02:43:12.320
dialectic in some new way that merely negates what is and thus opens possibilities for new ideas to

02:43:12.320 --> 02:43:16.960
bloom from the particulars for nothing in the way. We'll just get rid of everything that's

02:43:16.960 --> 02:43:19.680
in the way. We won't have a synthetic structure. We're just going to get everything out of the way

02:43:19.680 --> 02:43:25.520
and then that perennial philosophy might emerge. But this is still alchemical thinking. We see

02:43:25.520 --> 02:43:29.200
this with the post-modernist Foucault's idea that through criticism, he can expose all the

02:43:29.200 --> 02:43:35.280
absurdities and thus expand the potentialities of being. That goes the same vibe. Both of these

02:43:35.280 --> 02:43:39.840
lines appear in the post-Marxist dimension, but we see it in Neo-Marxism as well. Herbert

02:43:39.840 --> 02:43:45.120
Marcuse's Liberation is the same thing under the Neo-Marxist approach described thusly in his

02:43:45.120 --> 02:43:50.400
1969 essay on Liberation. Quote, beyond these limits, there's also the space both physical

02:43:50.400 --> 02:43:55.040
and mental for building a realm of freedom, which is not that of the present. Liberation,

02:43:55.040 --> 02:44:00.000
also from the liberties of the exploitative order, a liberation which must precede the construction

02:44:00.000 --> 02:44:05.040
of a free society, one which necessitates a historical break with the past and the present.

02:44:06.000 --> 02:44:11.760
Of course, the alchemy is still present. It's just worded differently and much less mystically.

02:44:11.760 --> 02:44:16.640
But in alchemy, this is a key important point. The alchemist must purify himself appropriately,

02:44:16.640 --> 02:44:22.240
whereas alchemical magic won't work. This is a key hermetic belief. For Herbert Marcuse,

02:44:22.240 --> 02:44:27.840
we see this actually in the essay on Liberation, which is again 1969, so it's pretty recent.

02:44:27.840 --> 02:44:32.160
And he writes in shockingly eugenicist terms. We've mentioned this before,

02:44:32.160 --> 02:44:37.680
what it will require. I'll actually quote here. What is now at stake are the needs themselves?

02:44:38.240 --> 02:44:42.240
At this stage, the question is no longer how can the individual satisfy his own needs without

02:44:42.240 --> 02:44:47.360
hurting others, rather how can he satisfy his needs without hurting himself, without reproducing

02:44:47.360 --> 02:44:51.920
through his aspirations and satisfactions, his dependence on an exploitative apparatus which,

02:44:52.480 --> 02:44:58.240
in satisfying his needs, perpetuates his servitude. The advent of a free society would be

02:44:58.240 --> 02:45:02.800
characterized by the fact that the growth of well-being turns into an essentially new quality

02:45:02.800 --> 02:45:08.480
of life. This qualitative change must occur in the needs and the infrastructure of man,

02:45:08.480 --> 02:45:13.600
itself a dimension of the infrastructure of society. The new direction, the new institutions,

02:45:13.600 --> 02:45:19.280
and relationships of production must express the assent of needs and satisfactions very different

02:45:19.280 --> 02:45:23.760
and even antagonistic to those prevalent and the exploitative societies. Such a change would

02:45:23.760 --> 02:45:29.760
constitute the Extinctual Basis for Freedom, which the long history of class society has blocked.

02:45:29.760 --> 02:45:33.920
Freedom would become the environment of an organism which is no longer capable of adapting

02:45:33.920 --> 02:45:39.360
to the competitive performances required for well-being under domination, no longer capable

02:45:39.360 --> 02:45:43.440
of tolerating the aggressiveness, brutality, and ugliness of the established way of life.

02:45:43.440 --> 02:45:48.640
The rebellion would then have to be taken, the rebellion would then have taken root in the very

02:45:48.640 --> 02:45:54.400
nature, the biology of the individual. Now, on these grounds, the rebels would redefine the

02:45:54.400 --> 02:45:59.520
objectives and the strategy of the political struggle in which alone the concrete goals of

02:45:59.520 --> 02:46:04.080
liberation can be determined. You hear Hegel all through this at this point, right? But he's talking

02:46:04.080 --> 02:46:08.800
about having to literally change the very nature of the biology of the individual so that he's no

02:46:08.800 --> 02:46:15.280
longer capable of tolerating domination. Maybe you could make him psychopathic. He does note in a

02:46:15.280 --> 02:46:20.240
footnote that he's not talking about biology as biology, like biology, biology, but rather that

02:46:20.240 --> 02:46:24.800
he's just making people totally intolerant to the idea of intolerance and of oppression.

02:46:24.800 --> 02:46:28.720
And look what we're doing to our poor children, making them with their microaggressions and they're

02:46:28.720 --> 02:46:33.120
so hypersensitive and they freak out and like people say no more politics at work at base camp

02:46:33.120 --> 02:46:36.960
and they throw themselves on the floor and cry and have tantrums and they have total meltdowns over

02:46:36.960 --> 02:46:41.200
everything psychologically incapable of dealing with life because they need liberation. They need

02:46:41.200 --> 02:46:47.840
this perfect liberated world. Ooh, well it's Marcus's project and is it happening? But he's

02:46:47.840 --> 02:46:51.760
pretty insistent about his biology. Whatever he says about meaning not really meaning biology,

02:46:51.760 --> 02:46:56.880
let's read a little bit more. Political radicalism thus implies moral radicalism,

02:46:56.880 --> 02:47:01.200
the emergence of a morality which might precondition man for freedom. So we've got to change

02:47:01.200 --> 02:47:06.800
morality completely. This radicalism activates the elementary organic foundation of morality in the

02:47:06.800 --> 02:47:12.640
human being, uh-oh, organic foundation. Prior to all ethical behavior in accordance with specific

02:47:12.640 --> 02:47:18.000
social standards, prior to all ideological expression, morality is a disposition of the organism,

02:47:18.000 --> 02:47:22.400
perhaps rooted in the erotic drive to counter aggressiveness, to create and preserve

02:47:22.960 --> 02:47:30.800
ever greater unities of life. We would then have this side of all values, sorry, we would then have

02:47:30.800 --> 02:47:35.680
this side of all values, an instinctual foundation for solidarity among human beings. So solidarity I

02:47:35.680 --> 02:47:41.280
mentioned is key. A solidarity which has been effectively repressed in line with the requirements

02:47:41.280 --> 02:47:46.160
of class society but which now appears as a precondition for liberty. Solidarity is a precondition

02:47:46.160 --> 02:47:51.360
for liberty. To the degree to which this foundation is itself historical in the malleability of human

02:47:51.360 --> 02:47:56.800
nature reaches into the depth of man's instinctual structure, changes in morality may sink down into

02:47:56.800 --> 02:48:02.400
the biological dimension and modify organic behavior. Once a specific morality is firmly

02:48:02.400 --> 02:48:07.280
established as a norm of social behavior, it is not only introjected, it operates as a norm of

02:48:07.280 --> 02:48:12.640
organic behavior. The organism receives and reacts to certain stimuli and ignores and repels others

02:48:12.640 --> 02:48:16.880
in accord with the introjected morality. Isn't that what's happened to our poor,

02:48:16.880 --> 02:48:23.280
emotionally crippled college students and adults now? Which is thus promoting or impeding the function

02:48:23.280 --> 02:48:28.720
of the organism as a living cell in the respective society. In this way, a society constantly recreates

02:48:28.720 --> 02:48:34.160
a side of consciousness and ideology, patterns of behavior and aspiration as part of the nature

02:48:34.160 --> 02:48:39.360
of its people. And unless the revolt reaches into this second nature, into these ingrown

02:48:39.360 --> 02:48:44.640
patterns, social change will remain incomplete and even self-defeating. That's a pretty scary project,

02:48:44.640 --> 02:48:49.360
man. Just going to say, but we'll finalize with a little bit more from the essay on liberation

02:48:49.360 --> 02:48:53.920
where he really gets into this biology thing. In the advanced capitalist countries, he writes,

02:48:53.920 --> 02:48:58.320
the radicalization of the working classes is counteracted by a socially engineered arrest of

02:48:58.320 --> 02:49:03.200
consciousness. Yeah, of course it is. That's his main thing. And by the development and satisfaction

02:49:03.200 --> 02:49:08.000
of needs which perpetuate the servitude of the exploited, a vested interest in the existing

02:49:08.000 --> 02:49:13.200
system is thus fostered in the instinctual structure of the exploited and the rupture with

02:49:13.200 --> 02:49:18.000
the continuum of repression is a necessary precondition of liberation and it does not occur.

02:49:19.040 --> 02:49:23.520
It follows that the radical change which is to transform the existing society into a free

02:49:23.520 --> 02:49:31.040
society must reach into a dimension of the human existence hardly considered in Marxian theory,

02:49:31.040 --> 02:49:36.320
the biological dimension, in which the vital, imperative needs and satisfactions of man assert

02:49:36.320 --> 02:49:40.880
themselves. And as much as these needs and satisfaction reproduce, a life in servitude,

02:49:40.880 --> 02:49:45.920
liberation presupposes change in this biological dimension. That is to say, different instinctual

02:49:45.920 --> 02:49:55.920
needs, different reactions of the body as well as of the mind. So again, alchemy. Purify oneself

02:49:55.920 --> 02:50:02.400
sufficiently and engage in the dialectic, the magic process by adopting the critical consciousness.

02:50:02.400 --> 02:50:07.200
This is what Marcuse demands and what will happen is a liberated utopia will emerge

02:50:07.200 --> 02:50:12.400
on the other side of everybody doing this by blooming out of the ashes of the existing society

02:50:12.480 --> 02:50:18.400
once all of its limitations and oppressions are burned away through alphaben, especially

02:50:18.400 --> 02:50:24.480
alphabenderculture. This is alchemy driven by the dialectic in order to achieve a utopia,

02:50:24.480 --> 02:50:30.960
gold sprouting from lead, a golden society, a golden age sprouting from an oppressive leaden age.

02:50:30.960 --> 02:50:35.040
This is the same alchemy and it requires here, literally at the biological level,

02:50:35.040 --> 02:50:39.600
just like the Soviets requested a new Soviet man, the purification of the self for it to

02:50:39.600 --> 02:50:45.040
actually work. The adoption of a pure consciousness of the religious, whether it's critical

02:50:45.040 --> 02:50:49.280
consciousness, class consciousness, racial consciousness, whatever it happens to be.

02:50:50.720 --> 02:50:55.280
So in essence, this is the Hegelian idea that people will not and cannot be free so long as they

02:50:55.280 --> 02:51:00.720
are other to the absolute. And in the instant that they genuinely become aware of their own role

02:51:00.720 --> 02:51:05.760
in manufacturing the absolute and how the absolute understands itself, the absolute will realize

02:51:05.760 --> 02:51:09.920
itself, history will end in liberation or communism or true freedom, whatever they want to say

02:51:10.480 --> 02:51:14.000
will emerge in this perfected society that comes out at the end of history.

02:51:14.000 --> 02:51:20.400
And that's Hegel's historicism upon which all of these stupid ideas are based. It's a Hegelian

02:51:20.400 --> 02:51:25.440
religion. Of course, we can put all that crap that Marcuse just said, the purification, etc.,

02:51:26.000 --> 02:51:30.560
much more simply by talking about a contemporary voice. Robin D'Angelo, the author of White

02:51:30.560 --> 02:51:37.040
Fragility, puts it from her much narrower perch in critical whiteness studies in that 2018 book

02:51:37.040 --> 02:51:42.560
called White Fragility, that you have to try to be less white. That's the ambition. Try to be less

02:51:42.560 --> 02:51:48.560
white. That's the solution. Try to be less white. Coca-Cola infamously took this up as a diversity

02:51:48.560 --> 02:51:52.800
imperative, which results in them facing massive blowback because people saw right through how

02:51:52.800 --> 02:51:59.920
horrific this is. But for D'Angelo, this is the same as Marcuse, really. The same idea as Marcuse

02:52:00.560 --> 02:52:05.760
if we were to just purify ourselves of the white supremacist superstructure, get that out of the

02:52:05.760 --> 02:52:11.280
way a racially liberated world might bloom. If we want to do that, we have to apply the dialectic,

02:52:11.280 --> 02:52:17.360
but we can only do that if we've already adopted this so-called racial humility, racial stamina,

02:52:18.000 --> 02:52:22.240
critical race consciousness that she's advocating. We have to be aware of her whiteness and strive

02:52:22.240 --> 02:52:27.760
to be less white. We have to recognize that there's no such thing as a positive white identity.

02:52:27.760 --> 02:52:32.960
That's another quote from D'Angelo. Once we purify ourselves, we can therefore apply the

02:52:32.960 --> 02:52:39.360
dialectic to challenge that white supremacist superstructure by disrupting, dismantling,

02:52:39.360 --> 02:52:44.400
whatever the words of the subverting. This is applying the flame that heats the world

02:52:44.400 --> 02:52:48.480
so that the alchemy toward a perfected idea is state and culture, and that's the end of history

02:52:48.480 --> 02:52:51.840
can be achieved. You hear it in Robin D'Angelo, you hear it in Herbert Marcuse, you see it in

02:52:51.920 --> 02:52:58.320
Marcuse, or you see it in Hegel, and it's really also in Marcuse. That line is completely

02:52:59.040 --> 02:53:03.200
drawn at this point, and now we're starting to see that it is a religion with a complete

02:53:03.200 --> 02:53:09.120
metaphysic, a complete different idea of how the world and God and being and nothing and everything

02:53:09.120 --> 02:53:13.600
are constituted, a God no longer that is, but a God that becomes by the actions of humans,

02:53:13.600 --> 02:53:18.480
understanding the problematics, and tearing them away so that the seeds of gold, the alchemy,

02:53:18.480 --> 02:53:26.080
will arise from that alphabend world. I know Alph Gehoben is the correct past tense there,

02:53:26.080 --> 02:53:33.440
or something like that, or Alph, I don't know, you can do the German. So the basic idea here

02:53:33.440 --> 02:53:37.600
is that in the process of creating the other, which is the world, God, which is present in

02:53:37.600 --> 02:53:42.800
everything, which is kind of a panentheist idea, exists in fragmented form, trapped within the

02:53:43.120 --> 02:53:49.600
imperfections of the world and the philosophies and religions that arise, the alchemical process

02:53:49.600 --> 02:53:55.840
is believed the same thing about seeds of gold being trapped in baser materials,

02:53:57.120 --> 02:54:01.200
is going to be applied here, the alchemical process is to treat those in some kind of an

02:54:01.200 --> 02:54:09.680
alembic, usually with fire, by spiritually pure alchemists who are in parallel are

02:54:09.680 --> 02:54:14.480
critically conscious philosophers, in other words by Gnostics, and what will happen is they

02:54:14.480 --> 02:54:18.160
will free the seeds of gold at a perfected society or perfected ideas and get them to

02:54:18.160 --> 02:54:24.080
blossom and thus change the base metal and material into gold, or the society into a perfected

02:54:24.080 --> 02:54:29.040
absolute. The idea will perfect, the absolute will realize itself, the end of history will arrive,

02:54:29.040 --> 02:54:35.120
and this is the idea behind Hegel's dialectical spiral as Trinity spiral that I've described.

02:54:35.280 --> 02:54:43.840
Maybe you think I go too far, well let's check again, let's go look at Markuza again, again these

02:54:43.840 --> 02:54:48.480
themes are going to appear over and over again in the introduction to the second edition of One

02:54:48.480 --> 02:54:53.760
Dimensional Man, this is not written by Markuza, they describe what Markuza's project is, and he

02:54:53.760 --> 02:54:58.800
writes, Markuza thought that dialectical philosophy could promote critical thinking, One Dimensional

02:54:58.800 --> 02:55:03.200
Man is perhaps Markuza's most sustained attempt to present and develop the categories of the

02:55:03.200 --> 02:55:09.600
dialectic philosophy developed by Hegel and Marx. For Markuza, dialectical thinking involved the

02:55:09.600 --> 02:55:14.560
ability to abstract one's perceptions and thought from existing forms in order to form more general

02:55:14.560 --> 02:55:19.920
concepts. Uncritical thinking derives its beliefs, norms, and values from existing thought and social

02:55:19.920 --> 02:55:24.160
practices, while critical thought seeks alternative modes of thought and behavior from which it

02:55:24.160 --> 02:55:30.400
creates a standpoint of critique. Such a critical standpoint requires developing what Markuza calls

02:55:30.400 --> 02:55:34.800
negative thinking, which negates existing forms of thought and reality from the perspective of

02:55:34.800 --> 02:55:41.520
higher possibilities, spiritually pure alchemy. This practice presupposes the ability to make

02:55:41.520 --> 02:55:46.320
a distinction between existence and essence, fact and potentiality, and appearance and reality,

02:55:46.320 --> 02:55:51.520
so these are things that will be dialecticized. Mere existence would be negated in favor of

02:55:51.520 --> 02:55:56.000
realizing higher potentialities, while norms discovered by reason would be used to criticize

02:55:56.000 --> 02:56:01.120
and overcome lower forms of thought and social organization. Thus, grasping potentialities for

02:56:01.120 --> 02:56:05.920
freedom and happiness would make possible the negation of conditions that inhibited individuals

02:56:05.920 --> 02:56:11.680
full development and realization, in other words, perceiving the possibility of self-determination

02:56:11.680 --> 02:56:17.120
and constructing one's own needs and values could enable individuals to break with the existing world

02:56:17.120 --> 02:56:22.640
of thought and behavior. Philosophy was thus to supply the norms for social criticism and the

02:56:22.640 --> 02:56:26.880
ideal of liberation, which would guide social change and individual self-transformation.

02:56:28.160 --> 02:56:34.400
And he also notes, critical and dialectical thinking by contrast postulates norms of criticism

02:56:34.400 --> 02:56:39.680
based on rational potentials for human happiness and freedom, which are used to negate existing

02:56:39.680 --> 02:56:44.400
states of affairs that oppress individuals and restrict human freedoms and well-being.

02:56:44.400 --> 02:56:49.520
Dialectical thought thus posits the existence of other realms of ideas, images, and imagination

02:56:49.520 --> 02:56:54.400
that serves as a potential guide for a social transformation that would realize the unrealized

02:56:54.400 --> 02:56:59.680
potentialities for a better life. Marcuse believes that great philosophy and art are the locus of

02:56:59.680 --> 02:57:04.560
these potentialities and critical norms, and he decodes the best products of western culture

02:57:04.560 --> 02:57:08.880
in this light. So he's performing alchemy on them in order to reach these higher

02:57:08.880 --> 02:57:16.960
unrealized potentialities for a better life. So for Hegel, where this all comes from, as we just

02:57:16.960 --> 02:57:22.640
heard, the divine expresses itself in nature. So the seeds of the divine, the perfected ideas,

02:57:23.440 --> 02:57:28.640
exist in everything, but yet everything is imperfect and must contain its own contradictions.

02:57:29.280 --> 02:57:34.960
The philosopher, when sufficiently Gnostic, will then be able to apply, in other words,

02:57:34.960 --> 02:57:38.800
having the right consciousness, will then be able to apply reason,

02:57:38.800 --> 02:57:44.160
verneumft, as opposed to mere verstaund. We'll come back to verneumft and verstaund in a minute.

02:57:44.240 --> 02:57:50.400
Via the dialectic, to expose the contradictions and in synthesis get the seeds of the divine

02:57:50.400 --> 02:57:56.720
to blossom into the world. This gives rise to more perfected ideas, and the process repeats again,

02:57:56.720 --> 02:58:02.880
with history acting as the alembic, or the world acting as the alembic, and dialectic acting as

02:58:02.880 --> 02:58:10.960
the fire, and alphabon acting as the reducing process. Occasionally for Hegel, great men of

02:58:10.960 --> 02:58:16.240
action, this is a key concept that he based off of, for example, Napoleon, are brought to the fore

02:58:16.240 --> 02:58:21.520
by history to move this process along in lurches. A lot of times they're warlords who kill a lot

02:58:21.520 --> 02:58:27.200
of people. Napoleon was a Zarkotype, like I said. Lenin, Hitler, Stalin, Mao, Sheikovarra, Castro,

02:58:27.200 --> 02:58:32.400
Pol Pot, possibly Woodrow Wilson, maybe FDR, and others, certainly looking more historically,

02:58:32.400 --> 02:58:38.000
Alexander, Genghis Khan, etc. These would all make the list of men of action. And they are used by

02:58:38.080 --> 02:58:43.520
history, according to Hegel, to move the process of history along, because history has this arching

02:58:43.520 --> 02:58:48.240
purpose to it, is ultimately to actualize the absolute. And it doesn't matter if these are

02:58:48.240 --> 02:58:53.840
good guys or bad guys, right? Because if they're bad guys, that's okay. Because sometimes it takes

02:58:53.840 --> 02:58:57.600
good roads, and sometimes it takes bad roads. That's what we heard from Hegel earlier, and then his own

02:58:57.600 --> 02:59:02.800
words. So philosophers primarily for Hegel, though, philosophers, he's got a high place for people like

02:59:02.800 --> 02:59:08.640
him, are meant to move this along in particular. And the tool that they're going to use as reason,

02:59:08.640 --> 02:59:17.680
which one is perfected, is the absolute. And I say folks very intentionally, who live within the

02:59:17.680 --> 02:59:23.920
geist, are also helping to move it along, because they help to expose those contradictions in the

02:59:23.920 --> 02:59:29.040
current state of affairs, which the philosophers will then be able to identify and resolve through

02:59:29.120 --> 02:59:33.040
proper application of dialectical synthesis. So you see this kind of revolving door that we

02:59:33.040 --> 02:59:38.640
talked about with the woke between the activists and the scholars here. The faster and the Hegelian

02:59:38.640 --> 02:59:42.400
thought process, the faster, especially the young Hegelian progressive thought process,

02:59:42.400 --> 02:59:46.720
the faster this process goes. In other words, the harder the dialectic is pushed, the more the

02:59:46.720 --> 02:59:51.280
existing society and status quo are torn down and broken, the faster the absolute will be able to

02:59:51.280 --> 02:59:56.560
realize itself through engagement with its other. And thus the faster everything will be perfected

02:59:56.560 --> 03:00:01.840
and turned to utopia. So this is, like I said, for Hegel, being a speculative philosopher, he

03:00:01.840 --> 03:00:07.600
believes he's looking in a mirror to remembering a process of uncovering or recollecting or

03:00:07.600 --> 03:00:13.520
remembering through speculation, which again, we're going to remember is mysticism, that philosophy

03:00:13.520 --> 03:00:18.400
perennis, the perennial or eternal philosophy, that is the one true philosophy that all theologies,

03:00:18.400 --> 03:00:23.120
all religions, all systematic world philosophies are all revealing some part of, but are not

03:00:24.080 --> 03:00:29.440
properly doing because they're not all convergent into one idea. The alchemical process then is

03:00:29.440 --> 03:00:35.360
to take the fragmented pieces of this philosophy, philosophy of perennis, and reduce it in the

03:00:35.360 --> 03:00:39.840
alembic of speculative philosophy down to its essential core. And the tool for doing this is

03:00:39.840 --> 03:00:44.720
going to be the dialectic, that's the fire really, across the differences and the way that it's

03:00:44.720 --> 03:00:51.280
actually done is through alphabin. That is the philosophy of perennis, which characterizes the

03:00:51.280 --> 03:00:57.680
absolute and indicates when realized that the absolute has actualized as the ultimate dialectical

03:00:57.680 --> 03:01:03.440
synthesis of all ideas, like I said before, everything in the world comes back to one idea.

03:01:03.440 --> 03:01:08.560
So this is Hegel's speculative idealism is trying to remember the Prisca Theologia,

03:01:08.560 --> 03:01:13.760
the primordial theology. That was a concept actually that was introduced just to make this

03:01:13.760 --> 03:01:20.800
point really clear in case it's not yet from Marcellio Fincino or Ficino in the 15th century

03:01:20.800 --> 03:01:28.240
through the 1400s, I guess then, which is a central concept in hermetic faith. That's alchemy.

03:01:28.800 --> 03:01:35.040
So it turns out Ficino was actually a priest, but he was also sufficiently hermetic to where he was

03:01:35.040 --> 03:01:40.960
nearly excommunicated. He was threatened with excommunication for his alchemy, also for his

03:01:40.960 --> 03:01:46.800
astrology, and maybe for his neoplatanism. So the parallels between Ficino and Hegelianism end up

03:01:46.800 --> 03:01:51.840
being pretty obvious. Hegel was certainly aware of them because he commented on them in one of his

03:01:51.840 --> 03:01:58.160
books. You can see this in the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, for example, where they write

03:01:58.160 --> 03:02:03.680
about Ficino. Ficino saw himself as one member of a venerable sequence of interpreters who added

03:02:03.680 --> 03:02:09.600
to a store of wisdom that got allowed progressively to unfold. So he's agnostic as well. Each of these

03:02:09.600 --> 03:02:13.920
Prisci theologi or ancient theologians had his part to play in discovering, documenting,

03:02:13.920 --> 03:02:17.680
and elaborating the truth contained in the writings of Plato and other ancient sages,

03:02:17.680 --> 03:02:24.160
a truth to which these sages may not have been fully privy acting as they were as vessels of

03:02:24.160 --> 03:02:30.960
divine truth. So Ficino, who was an inspiration in some ways to Hegel, was an astrologer and

03:02:30.960 --> 03:02:36.160
alchemist who was responsible for the translation of hermetic texts, meaning literally the text of

03:02:36.240 --> 03:02:44.240
Hermes, Trismegistus, along with various Neoplatanus into Latin. And Hegel, writing in the history of

03:02:44.240 --> 03:02:50.880
philosophy, is aware of him. Technically, he criticizes Ficino's Neoplatanism, but he also

03:02:50.880 --> 03:02:59.360
adopts his hermetic view and something of his Prisca theologiae. In particular, the view that all

03:02:59.360 --> 03:03:05.200
faiths and philosophies are manifestations of the one and the same ultimate faith that's being

03:03:05.200 --> 03:03:09.920
expressed inadequately and incompletely in the world. And so Hegel believes in his systematic

03:03:09.920 --> 03:03:16.000
philosophy and his reason when it's perfected and becomes the absolute that he has the accurate

03:03:16.000 --> 03:03:23.280
one true philosophy or faith. This is all being done for Hegel, however, because he sees the absolute

03:03:23.280 --> 03:03:27.600
as existing throughout time, even though it's becoming absolute throughout time as well,

03:03:28.560 --> 03:03:35.280
freeing up the philosophy of Parenis from the confines of cloudy nature, which has fragmented

03:03:35.280 --> 03:03:39.440
it and locked it away in various worldly forms, philosophies and theologies that were constructed

03:03:39.440 --> 03:03:43.840
by people who only know the part but forgot the whole. So for Hegel, when you know the whole,

03:03:43.840 --> 03:03:49.040
the parts all make sense. So this gets us, I said we were going to come back to first stand and for

03:03:49.040 --> 03:03:55.520
Nuunft. These are these two ideas of science and reason that Hegel had. So under the broader

03:03:55.520 --> 03:04:00.560
heading of knowledge that Wissenschaft in German, which is often translated as science,

03:04:01.360 --> 03:04:05.760
you actually have two categories for Hegel. One is for stand, which means understanding

03:04:05.760 --> 03:04:10.480
and translation. And one is for Nuunft, which is translated as reason. So for stand is the lower

03:04:10.480 --> 03:04:14.240
level. That's just understanding things. It's parallel to traditional theory and the critical

03:04:14.240 --> 03:04:18.720
and traditional theory break. It's just understanding how things work. It's physics, it's science,

03:04:18.720 --> 03:04:23.600
it's philosophy. Hegel hated, absolutely hated Isaac Newton, thought he was a total charlatan

03:04:23.680 --> 03:04:28.240
in a fraud because he was limited to these very observational, empirical, and very rigorous kind

03:04:28.240 --> 03:04:34.800
of things. He probably also hated his alchemy because Newton was an alchemist too. He died,

03:04:34.800 --> 03:04:38.640
I think, of mercury poisoning, as a matter of fact, as a result of his alchemy. For Nuunft,

03:04:38.640 --> 03:04:46.080
however, is reason. Reason's higher. And his articulation of this is actually laying out so

03:04:46.080 --> 03:04:52.800
called a logic of science or something like this, a system of science. And for stand, understanding

03:04:52.800 --> 03:04:58.720
is the low level. And at the higher level, you have this kind of critical, dialectical analysis.

03:04:58.720 --> 03:05:05.040
His systematic philosophy is reason. And for Nuunft is a reason. And when reason is perfected,

03:05:05.040 --> 03:05:11.840
you have the absolute, which is a perfected, reemerged philosophy of Perennis, which reflects

03:05:11.840 --> 03:05:18.000
the Prisciatheologia. So this is kind of a very arrogant way of viewing his own philosophy as

03:05:18.000 --> 03:05:23.200
basically perfect. But it's also a very gnostic way of thinking. For stand, where you're trying

03:05:23.200 --> 03:05:28.080
to understand the world and do so empirically and logically, that's a low level understanding.

03:05:28.080 --> 03:05:34.080
There's a higher level of understanding. And you kind of heard Markuza repeatedly appeal to this,

03:05:34.080 --> 03:05:37.520
a higher level of understanding that's available to the people who have true reason,

03:05:37.520 --> 03:05:41.840
which is freed up and has a consciousness behind it. And consciousness is the consciousness of the

03:05:41.840 --> 03:05:48.080
absolute. Pretty intense. We could put this a slightly different way.

03:05:52.000 --> 03:05:56.320
One of Hegel's tenets that under the purpose of reason is that the particular cannot be

03:05:56.320 --> 03:06:00.080
understood except in relationship to the whole. We were just talking about that. This is the

03:06:00.080 --> 03:06:03.840
focus on contradictions, which help you understand that you don't know the whole because if there's

03:06:03.840 --> 03:06:10.320
a contradiction, you clearly missed something. This means that Hegel's philosophy is ultimately,

03:06:10.320 --> 03:06:14.000
and these are some magic words I want you to pay attention to, Hegel's philosophy is ultimately

03:06:14.000 --> 03:06:20.080
holistic rather than reductionist. For stand is reductionist. It's to understand things,

03:06:20.080 --> 03:06:26.320
break them down, and get it. For nymphed is holistic. And that puts for stand is lowly,

03:06:26.320 --> 03:06:32.960
while for nymphed is higher. The holistic science. But it also means really that what he calls reason

03:06:32.960 --> 03:06:38.400
is actually ideology. And this is why all the way down this line, whether it's the young Hegelians,

03:06:38.400 --> 03:06:43.120
probably Hegel himself, the young Hegelians, the Marxists, the Neo-Marxists, the cultural Marxists,

03:06:44.720 --> 03:06:48.480
we get weird with the post-modernists, but certainly the woke all seem to think that they

03:06:48.480 --> 03:06:54.880
have something better, more holistic, superior understanding of the world than everybody else,

03:06:54.880 --> 03:07:05.120
and that is very Gnostic in nature. Turning back to the marxist.org glossary, looking up the term

03:07:05.120 --> 03:07:10.640
dialectic, we kind of get confirmation of this. They say their formal thinking often has trouble

03:07:10.640 --> 03:07:15.760
understanding the causes of events. Something has to be a cause and something else the effect.

03:07:15.760 --> 03:07:20.160
And people are surprised when they irrigate land and 20 years later, due to salination of the land,

03:07:20.160 --> 03:07:25.840
silting of the waterways, etc., they have a desert. Dialectics, on the other hand, understands that

03:07:25.840 --> 03:07:31.120
cause and effect are just one and another side of a whole network of relations, such as we have

03:07:31.120 --> 03:07:35.600
in an ecosystem. And one thing cannot be changed without changing the whole system. So here's our

03:07:35.600 --> 03:07:41.200
systemic thinking. Formal thinking often has trouble understanding the causes of events.

03:07:41.200 --> 03:07:45.920
Something has to be a cause and something else the effect. Sorry, I copied that twice.

03:07:47.280 --> 03:07:50.800
Changing the whole system is where I wanted to leave off there. I didn't mean to copy it twice,

03:07:50.800 --> 03:07:57.680
sorry. So dialectic, they write, has its origins in ancient society, both among the Chinese and

03:07:57.680 --> 03:08:04.400
the Greeks, where thinkers sought to understand nature as a whole and saw that everything is fluid,

03:08:04.400 --> 03:08:08.640
constantly changing, coming into being and passing away. It was only when the piecemeal method of

03:08:08.640 --> 03:08:14.240
observing nature in bits and pieces practiced in Western thinking in the 17th and 18th century had

03:08:14.240 --> 03:08:18.640
accumulated enough positive knowledge for the interconnections and transitions, the genesis

03:08:18.640 --> 03:08:23.440
of things to become comprehensible, that conditions became ripe for modern dialectics to make its

03:08:23.440 --> 03:08:28.080
appearance. It was Hegel who was able to sum up this picture of universal interconnection and

03:08:28.080 --> 03:08:32.880
mutability of all things in a system of logic, which is a foundation of what we today call

03:08:32.880 --> 03:08:38.480
dialectics. So in other words, all this stupid scientific understanding of things,

03:08:40.320 --> 03:08:47.120
people, formal thinking, all of this traditional theory is first stunned and it's lowly and it's

03:08:47.120 --> 03:08:51.760
stupid and people make big mistakes like turning their farmland into desert by not understanding

03:08:51.760 --> 03:08:56.960
on a higher level. But we have a higher level for Neumft, which is the dialectic,

03:08:56.960 --> 03:09:01.840
which is Hegel's systematic philosophy. So he names his own systematic philosophy ultimately

03:09:01.840 --> 03:09:09.200
as logic and reason and that systematic philosophy is, in fact, for him, the higher way of thinking

03:09:09.200 --> 03:09:14.480
and it is driven by the dialectic. So this is Hegel's metaphysics and it ties into that thread

03:09:14.480 --> 03:09:18.640
that I said that the operating system is the dialectic. So in one sense, you could follow

03:09:18.640 --> 03:09:22.960
Marx who said Hegel had the thing standing on its head and turned it back upright and then the

03:09:22.960 --> 03:09:27.040
Neomarks who said that Marx had kind of got this backwards and had to turn Hegel back upright again.

03:09:27.760 --> 03:09:32.480
I think it's more accurate, though, to analyze these three groups in a different way and kind of a

03:09:32.480 --> 03:09:37.760
more dialectical frame, if you will. I think it'd be more accurate to say that Hegel focused on the

03:09:37.760 --> 03:09:43.920
ideas, which is to say God, the absolute. Marx focused on the state and thus the materials of

03:09:43.920 --> 03:09:48.800
world or the sun and the Neomarks is focused on the culture, which is the spirit or the

03:09:48.800 --> 03:09:57.840
gist. So that makes a solid, very clear through line that these people are all the Hegel Marxists,

03:09:57.840 --> 03:10:02.560
Neomarksists and their woke inheritors are all talking about the same thing with just different

03:10:02.560 --> 03:10:07.840
aspects being what they believe is the relevant part where you do the alchemical process. For

03:10:07.840 --> 03:10:13.040
Hegel, if you want to change the world, you focus on the ideas. For Marx, if you want to change the

03:10:13.040 --> 03:10:18.400
world, you focus on the state and the material conditions. For the Neomarksists, if you want to

03:10:18.400 --> 03:10:22.800
change the world, you focus on the culture and that translates into the woke as well.

03:10:24.400 --> 03:10:29.920
Just as an aside, by the way, take a moment to recoil in horror what it implies under Marxism,

03:10:29.920 --> 03:10:36.240
that a philosophy treats the state like it's Jesus, which in some sense provides salvation and life,

03:10:36.240 --> 03:10:40.400
but also an ideal model for how to live an ethical life because that's really what's going on under

03:10:40.480 --> 03:10:44.800
Hegelian statism, especially as it got expressed in Marxism. Because in this way,

03:10:46.320 --> 03:10:52.000
just recoil in horror by that for a second, just hang on, Jesus as the state. State becomes Jesus.

03:10:54.560 --> 03:10:59.520
The way the truth and the life become the state. This really is how Hegel thought about

03:10:59.520 --> 03:11:04.960
the state, by the way. We'll come back to this in a few moments. So in this way of thinking,

03:11:04.960 --> 03:11:09.200
just summing up the metaphysics, if I can a little bit, Hegel remains speculative,

03:11:09.200 --> 03:11:15.200
which means mystical, trying to apply the dialectic to ideas. Marx frees him from his mystical shell,

03:11:15.200 --> 03:11:19.280
makes the dialectic into dialectical materialism, and seeks to exploit the contradictions of

03:11:19.280 --> 03:11:24.560
material life by raising class consciousness in the people who experience it. And the Neomarksists

03:11:24.560 --> 03:11:29.520
shift that whole project to alphabend or coulter, the dialectical abolishment or

03:11:29.520 --> 03:11:35.840
transformation of culture and working in the geist. So the current woke project is primarily

03:11:35.840 --> 03:11:42.400
an effort of constant multi-dimensional alphabend or culture, cultural warfare

03:11:42.400 --> 03:11:48.960
of the dialectical leftist motif. Thus it's no surprise that we are now currently embroiled

03:11:48.960 --> 03:11:55.600
in a totalizing international culture war. And it's also very easy to see who the antagonists are

03:11:55.600 --> 03:12:05.040
and how they proceed. And the way that they proceed is through this culture war, this alphabender

03:12:05.040 --> 03:12:12.080
culture tear down the existing culture to cause problems. It's also very easy to see this whole

03:12:12.080 --> 03:12:18.080
project in all three of these forms as being a religion. In fact, three species or three

03:12:18.080 --> 03:12:23.440
denominations of one religion or maybe four denominations of one religion. The Judeo-Christian

03:12:23.440 --> 03:12:27.600
model is not a terrible metaphor, but I don't want you to get me wrong and take this all too

03:12:27.600 --> 03:12:31.520
literally. I'm just using a comparison. I don't want to upset any of my Christian friends here.

03:12:31.520 --> 03:12:34.880
I want to get people to think. I want to spur the thinking. I want to use a historical

03:12:34.880 --> 03:12:40.480
development of Christianity in this regard. I'm not comparing the values or the ethics involved.

03:12:40.480 --> 03:12:44.080
I'm not comparing the value. I'm not comparing the truth. I'm just using it as a comparison

03:12:44.080 --> 03:12:48.560
point so people understand. But in this sense, one, you could almost think of Hegel himself

03:12:48.560 --> 03:12:53.760
as being kind of Judaic. And he's the one that's establishing and making covenant with,

03:12:53.760 --> 03:12:58.800
documenting this new absolute deity. Marx then falls into the role of the early pre-Polyan

03:12:58.800 --> 03:13:03.440
Christians who have brought this faith into a new era of practicality, but whose reach is

03:13:03.440 --> 03:13:08.640
relatively limited. And the Neo-Marxists, by turning to Alphabander Coulter down through the

03:13:08.640 --> 03:13:14.000
woke, would be like the Pauline evangelists whose reach is virtually unlimited. And that's

03:13:14.000 --> 03:13:17.840
sort of the religious structure of this religion in terms of how it comes out practically.

03:13:19.600 --> 03:13:25.760
Hegel, the Judaic faith is very exclusive. The kind of pre-Polyan Christian approach is also

03:13:25.760 --> 03:13:33.120
quite limited in terms of its reach, but evangelistic Christianity is billions in global

03:13:33.440 --> 03:13:42.080
rapidly expansive. And this Pauline demand to evangelize is indicative of what you see in

03:13:42.080 --> 03:13:47.760
the Neo-Marxists and the evangelists by moving the entire project into the site of Geist.

03:13:48.560 --> 03:13:54.160
So rather than working within the idea as the deity, or working within the material world

03:13:54.160 --> 03:13:58.720
as the sun, they instead turn to the Geist. In other words, they're working through what Hegel

03:13:58.720 --> 03:14:04.240
would conceive of as the Holy Spirit, and that the Spirit is what moves the world. And good night

03:14:04.240 --> 03:14:08.800
are they ever succeeding at moving the world with it. Just a metaphor, though. Don't get too

03:14:08.800 --> 03:14:14.320
caught up in that. In all three cases, though, the basic underlying faith is identical, present,

03:14:14.320 --> 03:14:18.560
largely constant, and that faith is based on Hegel's metaphysics, which is ultimately a

03:14:18.560 --> 03:14:24.560
metaphysics based on societal alchemy that's meant to create some new world that's perfected

03:14:24.560 --> 03:14:30.560
and utopian. And this leaves it open to megalomaniacs, who throughout history have come up and picked

03:14:30.560 --> 03:14:36.480
up these ideas, whether Hitler, whether Stalin, whether Lenin, whether Mao, we could name more,

03:14:36.480 --> 03:14:40.400
who pick up these ideas and think that their vision of the right side of history can be

03:14:40.400 --> 03:14:44.960
implemented under their rule. And the woke, although they don't have this charismatic

03:14:44.960 --> 03:14:50.080
man of action behind them right now as it's phrased in Hegel, are doing the same thing,

03:14:50.080 --> 03:14:56.160
which is why I've called it Leninism 4.0 in the past. So let's step back now. Let's kind of change

03:14:56.160 --> 03:15:01.520
gears and start heading toward a very long wrap up to this. We've got a ways to go still. We're

03:15:01.520 --> 03:15:09.040
over three hours. It's amazing. Step back to this whole line of broadly Hegelian thought,

03:15:09.040 --> 03:15:12.720
there are lots of consequences. Let's talk about the consequences of this line of thinking.

03:15:12.720 --> 03:15:19.120
So one is necessity and urgency to the dialectic. If you really believe that the utopia is brought

03:15:19.120 --> 03:15:25.200
about faster by the process of the dialectic, you have to do this hard and fast as hard and

03:15:25.200 --> 03:15:29.680
fast as possible. This is what the progressives drive at. The more vigorously the dialectic

03:15:29.680 --> 03:15:34.320
is applied, the faster we get to utopia that exists at the end of history. So everybody

03:15:34.320 --> 03:15:40.160
whom resists must somehow be evil because they resist the idea of utopia and they drag humanity's

03:15:40.160 --> 03:15:45.680
feats, they drag history's feet. And in the whole time that is happening, they maintain all of these

03:15:45.680 --> 03:15:52.240
oppressions of the imperfected society. That's evil. So you're going to see urgency. You're going

03:15:52.240 --> 03:15:57.200
to see demands for conformity. You're going to see demands for collectivism as a result. We're

03:15:57.200 --> 03:16:00.960
also going to see statism and I'm going to have to quote Hegel quite a bit, but you already saw

03:16:00.960 --> 03:16:04.080
all these seeds of statism. I just haven't really backed them up, but I really want to convince

03:16:04.080 --> 03:16:08.960
you that Hegel was a statist, so it's no surprise that Marxism becomes statist. The neo-Marxism

03:16:08.960 --> 03:16:14.080
is totally totalitarian and the wokeism inherits both statism and totalitarianism because

03:16:14.080 --> 03:16:19.280
Hegel's philosophy is ultimately profoundly statist. Remember that the state is a divine

03:16:19.280 --> 03:16:24.800
idea as expressed on earth is pretty statist. So in the philosophy of Hegel writes, quote,

03:16:24.800 --> 03:16:30.880
the state is absolutely rational in as much as it is the actuality of the substantial will

03:16:30.880 --> 03:16:36.240
which it possesses in the particular self-consciousness once that consciousness has been raised to

03:16:36.240 --> 03:16:41.520
consciousness of its universality. That's a complicated way of saying that basically once

03:16:41.520 --> 03:16:47.600
consciousness becomes kind of critically aware, then you have the state being absolutely

03:16:47.600 --> 03:16:54.080
rational and it's going to be a perfected state like I keep saying. This substantial unity Hegel

03:16:54.080 --> 03:17:01.680
writes is an absolute unmoved end in itself in which freedom comes into its supreme right.

03:17:02.400 --> 03:17:06.320
On the other hand, this final end has supreme right against the individual

03:17:06.400 --> 03:17:13.520
who's supreme duty is to be a member of the state. So total statism under Hegelian thought,

03:17:13.520 --> 03:17:20.080
and you see this exact mentality all the way down that whole line, young Hegelian, Marxist,

03:17:20.080 --> 03:17:27.280
neo-Marxist, woke. What else did Hegel say? Same in philosophy of right, he says, the state is

03:17:27.280 --> 03:17:34.160
the actuality of the ethical idea. It is the ethical mind qua, the substantial will, manifest and

03:17:34.160 --> 03:17:39.600
revealed to itself, knowing and thinking itself, accomplishing what it knows and insofar as it

03:17:39.600 --> 03:17:46.560
knows it. This sets aside, of course, I mean this more statism obviously, this sets aside,

03:17:46.560 --> 03:17:50.640
of course, is a much more famous declaration in the philosophy of history which I just referenced,

03:17:50.640 --> 03:17:55.680
for truth is the unity of the universal and subjective will and the universal is to be

03:17:55.680 --> 03:18:01.440
found in the state and its laws, its universal and rational arguments. The state is a divine idea

03:18:01.440 --> 03:18:07.440
as it exists on earth. We have in it, therefore, the object of history in a more definite shape

03:18:07.440 --> 03:18:13.840
than before and in which freedom obtains objectivity and lives in the enjoyment of this

03:18:13.840 --> 03:18:20.240
objectivity. So this is why they think freedom comes from the state in Hegelian leftism.

03:18:21.280 --> 03:18:28.080
And remember, the state has the supreme right against the individual whose supreme duty is

03:18:28.080 --> 03:18:33.920
to be a member of the state. This is Hegelian statism. So all of his theosophy aside, all of

03:18:33.920 --> 03:18:37.680
his metaphysical side, all of this has political consequences and free societies like the United

03:18:37.680 --> 03:18:42.800
States, especially any free society, the United States in particular, that proceeds from a Lockean

03:18:42.800 --> 03:18:48.320
or then derived Jeffersonian framework, we believe that rights precede the state. Our rights were

03:18:48.320 --> 03:18:55.840
endowed by a creator. They are inalienable. In a Hegelian framework, this is not how it works. The

03:18:55.840 --> 03:19:01.280
individual is totally to be subsumed by the state. It has a supreme right against it and the

03:19:01.280 --> 03:19:06.800
individual has a complete duty to the state, total statism, total collectivism. So rights are then

03:19:06.800 --> 03:19:12.720
replaced by privileges to be granted by the state. This is a completely different political model.

03:19:14.240 --> 03:19:19.680
Rights endowed by the creator meets the antithesis of privileges granted by the state.

03:19:20.480 --> 03:19:24.080
The connection to what's going on in the Woke ideology today here cannot be missed,

03:19:24.080 --> 03:19:27.840
especially in the now famous declaration in Critical Race Theory and Introduction

03:19:27.840 --> 03:19:33.520
that I've repeatedly quoted from page 23 in my edition, first edition. Critical Race Theos

03:19:33.520 --> 03:19:39.520
are highly suspicious of another liberal mainstay, namely rights. Of course they are. And they're

03:19:39.520 --> 03:19:43.600
simultaneously obsessed with privilege and how the system, which is a manifestation of the idea

03:19:43.600 --> 03:19:48.880
state in the culture or geist, creates and thus bestows privilege. Privilege is something that's

03:19:48.880 --> 03:19:52.720
granted by the state. They're obsessed with the idea of privilege. They're obsessed with who has

03:19:52.720 --> 03:19:56.960
privilege and how that's unfair because the state itself is unfair because the entire structure

03:19:56.960 --> 03:20:02.240
of the idea state and culture are incorrect. And so they agitate culture knowing that that's where

03:20:02.240 --> 03:20:07.520
you have the most drive to change the entire thing, to reorganize who has privilege. That's

03:20:07.520 --> 03:20:10.400
why they're so obsessed with privilege. That's why they want people to check their privilege. That's

03:20:10.400 --> 03:20:14.240
why they want to criticize privilege. That's why they're constantly harping on privilege,

03:20:14.240 --> 03:20:17.920
because privilege is something that comes down from the state and they want to reorganize everything.

03:20:18.000 --> 03:20:22.880
So the privilege gets reorganized so that it operates according to their ideology,

03:20:22.880 --> 03:20:27.600
their worldview. Another consequence of the Higellian thought, as I've just mentioned a couple

03:20:27.600 --> 03:20:31.520
times, is collectivism therefore. Because when the ideas are perfected, and this is a little bit of

03:20:31.520 --> 03:20:35.520
a philosophical point, everybody must have the same ideas because they're perfect. And all the

03:20:35.520 --> 03:20:39.680
contradictions that lead to different ideas must have been synthesized. Now think about it. If

03:20:39.680 --> 03:20:43.040
anybody has different ideas, that's the site of contradictions. If your idea and my idea are

03:20:43.040 --> 03:20:47.360
different, we now have a dialectic between us. So that means it's not perfectly synthesized.

03:20:47.360 --> 03:20:51.920
So we don't have the perfect idea, therefore the absolute has not recognized itself unless we

03:20:51.920 --> 03:20:57.040
all have the same idea. There can be no cognitive liberty in the perfected state. We have to have

03:20:57.040 --> 03:21:02.880
total collectivism. We don't all have to even be the same. We have to think the same. And this is

03:21:02.880 --> 03:21:08.240
going to happen by bringing that state, by all subsuming our will to the state, giving over our

03:21:08.240 --> 03:21:13.760
will, our duty to the state entirely. So now we're a collectivist organization. So collectivism

03:21:13.760 --> 03:21:18.480
is massively, I don't think, of course, the Hegelian thought created collectivism. Collectivism

03:21:18.480 --> 03:21:23.920
precedes it, but this is an amplification of it to a traumatic degree with a powerful collectivist

03:21:23.920 --> 03:21:29.360
metaphysic underneath it. And this, of course, collectivism leads people who take it up to try

03:21:29.360 --> 03:21:34.400
to force a situation because they believe that when there's total conformity to their totalizing

03:21:34.400 --> 03:21:41.760
ideology, and that's collectively maintained, then we're now near or at the point of the absolute

03:21:41.760 --> 03:21:47.520
realizing itself. We're now at the perfected point, and the utopia is imminent. Because we're all part

03:21:47.520 --> 03:21:51.680
of the dialectical process that's moving history forward, and we're all in it together. We're all

03:21:51.680 --> 03:21:57.440
in it together, right? That's collectivism. And of course, anybody who has a different idea becomes

03:21:57.440 --> 03:22:05.040
both a problem, but also proof that the absolute hasn't realized itself, because the ideas haven't

03:22:05.040 --> 03:22:09.040
been perfected. So that person becomes a site, somebody with a different idea, somebody with

03:22:09.040 --> 03:22:14.160
their own thoughts, with cognitive freedom becomes a site where the dialectic is continuing to play

03:22:14.160 --> 03:22:18.800
out. But that means it's not done playing out. So the utopia is not here. So somebody with different

03:22:18.800 --> 03:22:24.400
thoughts is preventing the emergence of the utopia, and probably they're just being stubborn. And you

03:22:24.400 --> 03:22:30.000
can see where the frustration starts to rise and where people get shot. People who don't want to

03:22:30.000 --> 03:22:35.920
get on board with this, especially once some psychopath or megalomaniacal man of action have

03:22:35.920 --> 03:22:42.320
taken control and power, which is totally a weakness of this ideology because their man of

03:22:42.320 --> 03:22:46.560
action is always being looked for, who's going to move this through. That's going to be perceived

03:22:46.560 --> 03:22:51.760
from within this logic as being against the realization of utopia, problematic, and in need

03:22:51.760 --> 03:22:57.760
of elimination, or at least of excommunication or silencing or complete marginalization.

03:22:58.800 --> 03:23:04.320
And that's exactly what we see. That's cancel culture. And that's exactly what we saw with

03:23:04.320 --> 03:23:08.720
much more horrific manifestations under people like Lenin and Stalin and Mao, etc.

03:23:09.760 --> 03:23:15.600
Che Guevara, Fidel, you know, you name them. And this is another thing I just mentioned,

03:23:15.600 --> 03:23:22.400
you know, these guys, this kind of a mentality, this Gaelian magic is wide open to psychopaths

03:23:22.400 --> 03:23:26.400
and other megalomaniacs who think that they have, and they have the charisma to pull it off a little

03:23:26.400 --> 03:23:32.240
bit, and the total ruthlessness to force it, they think they have the vision. They've studied the

03:23:32.240 --> 03:23:36.640
theory, and they know what it is. So they have the vision and the capacity to decide what the

03:23:36.640 --> 03:23:40.720
right side of history actually is. And it's going to strangely conform to their freaking pathologies,

03:23:40.720 --> 03:23:46.000
of course, and they're going to install a pathocracy, a pathological government that basically

03:23:46.000 --> 03:23:50.800
tries to make their life like everybody's working for them. And they have the ability to usher that

03:23:50.800 --> 03:23:57.440
in at whatever costs. This is going to happen again and again under a Gaelian framework. This is why

03:23:57.440 --> 03:24:02.880
the left right now is utterly catastrophic, and it keeps generating these catastrophic movements.

03:24:03.600 --> 03:24:09.200
Hegel's man of action is meant to come in in the attempt to fulfill history. History is using

03:24:09.200 --> 03:24:14.400
him. He's not even his own agency. History is using the man of action to progress the dialectic,

03:24:14.400 --> 03:24:21.920
to progress history. As critical race theory has it, right? The dialect, and so the dialectic

03:24:21.920 --> 03:24:28.800
progresses, right? And if he fails in his mission to fulfill history, that still fits into the same

03:24:28.800 --> 03:24:34.320
mold. History still progresses. If he doesn't fulfill history, history progresses. He win-win.

03:24:34.320 --> 03:24:37.920
So he's likely to gain significant support from the dialectical left who believes in this kind of

03:24:37.920 --> 03:24:45.600
faith. But this leads into these kind of mentalities that we keep hearing, these tropes. For example,

03:24:45.600 --> 03:24:50.880
real communism has never been tried, because every attempt so far was actually just a case where it

03:24:50.880 --> 03:24:56.240
wasn't real communism. People forwarded some new synthetic idea that wasn't the totally synthetic

03:24:56.240 --> 03:25:01.760
perfected idea, and the contradictions that they had in their attempt were revealed to them through

03:25:01.760 --> 03:25:06.960
the unfolding process of history, which might be tens or hundreds of millions of dead people,

03:25:06.960 --> 03:25:12.080
or world wars. World War I and World War II are both the results of this. For example,

03:25:12.640 --> 03:25:18.160
all of the communist failures are results of this. Hitler is a result of this. All of this is a result

03:25:18.160 --> 03:25:25.600
of a Hegelian dialectic being taken up as a faith. So they say real communism hasn't been tried,

03:25:26.240 --> 03:25:30.720
because it will only be tried or only will have occurred after the absolute realizes itself,

03:25:30.720 --> 03:25:35.360
not before. And so everything up to that point, no matter how bad, remember good roads and bad

03:25:35.360 --> 03:25:40.000
roads, is how history progresses, was just the part of the process of making our way there.

03:25:41.120 --> 03:25:46.800
So thesis, communism is the way. Antithesis, 100 million people dead. Synthesis, neo-Marxism,

03:25:46.800 --> 03:25:50.800
let's shift it to culture. Let's get out of material and shift to geist. It'll work this time.

03:25:52.560 --> 03:25:58.240
Furthermore, all these mass deaths that we see through these awful Hegelian projects,

03:25:58.880 --> 03:26:04.400
these people are just martyrs of history. They're not a tragedy. They're a victory.

03:26:05.360 --> 03:26:11.120
100 million dead? Good. That's the view, because history used them. They're martyrs,

03:26:11.120 --> 03:26:15.600
but history used them to reveal the contradictions and the ideas that are being forwarded in that age,

03:26:15.600 --> 03:26:19.920
so they're not really a loss. They were revealing those contradictions as history needed them to.

03:26:19.920 --> 03:26:23.920
History used them and discarded them, just as it does men of action.

03:26:24.880 --> 03:26:29.920
So indeed, the 100 million dead are a benefit under this kind of a worldview. History, under

03:26:29.920 --> 03:26:35.200
Hegel's philosophy, under his historicism, which was praised by Engels, uses people for its purpose

03:26:35.200 --> 03:26:40.000
and then discards them, so 100 million dead are just part of that process. Ends justify the means,

03:26:40.080 --> 03:26:43.360
after all. We keep hearing these things, they're ends in and of themselves.

03:26:44.640 --> 03:26:48.880
As Hegel had it then, the spirit of the time-commanded movement, the absolute marches through

03:26:48.880 --> 03:26:53.920
history by good roads and bad ones, so long as it continues marching, 100 million dead is just

03:26:53.920 --> 03:26:59.200
another road, just another part of the process. It's all progress, no matter how bad it is.

03:27:00.080 --> 03:27:02.560
So let's ratchet down if you're not just from that horror show.

03:27:04.720 --> 03:27:08.800
One more example, and then we'll talk about what to do about it to wrap up,

03:27:08.800 --> 03:27:12.640
getting close to the four-hour mark. People wouldn't maybe expect is another consequence

03:27:12.640 --> 03:27:16.880
of the Hegelian thought is the interfaith movement. We're ratcheting way down from 100 million dead.

03:27:17.760 --> 03:27:21.520
The interfaith movement, this is actually another aspect of Hegel's philosophy,

03:27:22.240 --> 03:27:27.360
or the results of it, because of that Priscotheologia and the philosophy of Perennis that he's after.

03:27:27.360 --> 03:27:31.200
Interfaith is the attempt to bring all the various faiths and maybe philosophies together.

03:27:31.760 --> 03:27:35.840
You can think of the UU Church, the United Universalists, for example,

03:27:35.920 --> 03:27:40.400
and extract from them what was originally there, that Priscotheologia, before it became

03:27:40.400 --> 03:27:45.360
corrupted and worldly, or to identify within them the various aspects reflected of the philosophy

03:27:45.360 --> 03:27:50.080
of Perennis that is the perennial philosophy that all of them are just badly simulating in the

03:27:50.080 --> 03:27:57.680
simulation and simulacris sense of John Baudrillard. So for Marx, state atheism and his view of

03:27:57.680 --> 03:28:02.640
materialism would do, and our present incarnation of all this nonsense, which is woke, as with the

03:28:02.640 --> 03:28:08.880
others before, a highly refined, mostly nonsensical vision of social justice, is something to do with

03:28:08.880 --> 03:28:15.920
the philosophy of Perennis. Equity becomes the updated vision of communism under this social

03:28:15.920 --> 03:28:22.080
justice model. Public-private partnerships become the vehicle, a supernational superstate that

03:28:22.080 --> 03:28:30.960
replaces a state as nation-state. So we have our equity geist, we have our supernational state

03:28:30.960 --> 03:28:35.520
in public-private partnerships. And the faith traditions of the world all cheer this on by

03:28:35.520 --> 03:28:40.080
subverting their own beliefs to the synthetic idea of social justice. So the Christians are

03:28:40.080 --> 03:28:44.000
social justice and saying it in Christianese. The Muslims are social justice and saying it in

03:28:44.000 --> 03:28:48.960
Islamese. The Buddhists are social justice and saying it in Buddhistese. And everybody's actually

03:28:48.960 --> 03:28:52.480
not preaching their own or talking about their own faith or their own philosophy or their own

03:28:52.480 --> 03:28:58.480
tradition. They're all just using that as kind of parasitically, using that to forward one different

03:28:58.480 --> 03:29:03.600
faith, which is social justice. And a socially just world is the new name for the project

03:29:03.600 --> 03:29:07.840
that will lead the absolute to realize itself and actualize. This is all still Hegelian

03:29:07.840 --> 03:29:13.120
metaphysical faith. So I hope I've now established my two big takeaways and we can turn to what we

03:29:13.120 --> 03:29:18.000
might do with this information. One, we should understand that the operating system of the left,

03:29:18.000 --> 03:29:22.960
and I devoted two hours to this, so I hope you got the point, is in fact the Hegelian dialectic.

03:29:23.840 --> 03:29:27.600
Though it comes in different forms and with different focuses, largely because the dialectic

03:29:27.600 --> 03:29:32.880
being its main operating system applies to itself and concentrates and changes it. So from

03:29:32.880 --> 03:29:39.200
Hegel's very idealistic view to Marxist dialectical materialist view to the neo-Marxist very cultural

03:29:39.200 --> 03:29:45.920
alphabanderic culture view to the woke, you know, kaleidoscope of identity politics that we have

03:29:45.920 --> 03:29:53.120
today. In that sense, what we see as an underlying metaphysics and underlying tool, it's ultimately

03:29:53.120 --> 03:29:59.040
religious and is being driven by this process, this dialectical process that is ultimately

03:29:59.040 --> 03:30:05.520
alchemical in nature. Understanding this thing is absolutely crucial to understanding what's

03:30:05.520 --> 03:30:10.240
going on now and the currents of leftist thought since at least the 1830s and maybe earlier,

03:30:10.240 --> 03:30:13.680
and it should truly be seen as a religious movement. By the way, of course, I mentioned the

03:30:13.680 --> 03:30:20.960
dialectic with the tool of alphabon at its core is ultimately what drives the whole thing. So the

03:30:20.960 --> 03:30:27.040
methodological undercurrent of the entire leftist project over the same two-century time frame

03:30:27.040 --> 03:30:35.760
is dialectic driven by alphabon, abolish, destroy, undermine, while trying to pull out and blossom

03:30:35.760 --> 03:30:42.080
the seed of gold within it. So if we turn to Ben Shapiro's, now he's been talking a lot about this

03:30:42.080 --> 03:30:46.880
trichotomy in society of leftists. I'm going to talk about what to do about it. Leftist liberals

03:30:46.880 --> 03:30:51.440
and conservatives. One thing we can take away from this mentality already is that liberals

03:30:51.440 --> 03:30:56.160
and conservatives in our society and free societies form a more natural and sensible

03:30:56.160 --> 03:31:01.280
allyship for maintaining freedom than do leftists and liberals, though liberals don't seem to realize

03:31:01.280 --> 03:31:05.680
this yet. So liberals really should be allying with conservatives, not on conservative policy goals,

03:31:05.680 --> 03:31:12.080
but on the maintenance of a world order that is not this insane Hegelian leftism that's likely to

03:31:12.080 --> 03:31:16.160
lead to the same kinds of catastrophes it keeps leading to over and over again, because alchemy

03:31:16.160 --> 03:31:22.960
is not real and you can't build a positive thing out of negation constantly. In one sense, we could

03:31:22.960 --> 03:31:27.760
say then, this is another thing I want to write eventually, the West could be said to have three

03:31:27.760 --> 03:31:31.520
gods. I want to write an essay called The Three Gods of the West exploring this idea. In some

03:31:31.520 --> 03:31:35.200
broad sense, these would be the Judeo-Christian God, which would be roughly for the conservatives,

03:31:35.200 --> 03:31:41.120
we don't have to be too, this is again just kind of tin potting the ideas, but Judeo-Christian God,

03:31:41.120 --> 03:31:46.080
roughly for the conservatives, secularized, it's not exactly Spinozin, but Spinozin,

03:31:46.080 --> 03:31:50.800
Lockean God, I know Locke was a Christian calm down, that it's kind of characterized in what you

03:31:50.800 --> 03:31:54.960
see in the Jeffersonian Bible or the Jefferson Bible where we carved out all of the mysticism and

03:31:54.960 --> 03:32:00.720
the magic and whatever else is the miracles with a razor knife early in the nation's founding.

03:32:00.720 --> 03:32:05.760
It was reflecting those ideals, the very Jeffersonian liberal ideals, and that's for the liberals. So

03:32:05.760 --> 03:32:13.520
we have this kind of Lockean, Spinozin, Jeffersonian freedom deity for the liberals versus Judeo-Christian

03:32:13.520 --> 03:32:18.560
God for the conservatives. And then we have the Hegelian absolute as for the leftists,

03:32:18.560 --> 03:32:22.880
which is a fundamentally different thing that's inimical to the underlying philosophical foundations

03:32:22.880 --> 03:32:27.360
shared by the conservatives and the liberals. So liberals and conservatives here, what I'm saying,

03:32:28.080 --> 03:32:32.720
once we understand what this leftism, this Hegelian faith really is, liberals and conservatives,

03:32:32.720 --> 03:32:37.440
as we use it kind of in the, I'm saying, Ben Shapiro's trichotomy, leftist liberals and

03:32:37.440 --> 03:32:42.720
conservatives, it's not perfect. I get it, I know, I could criticize the language, but it's

03:32:42.720 --> 03:32:48.240
useful for how we're thinking. Liberals and conservatives in that sense have something

03:32:48.240 --> 03:32:54.320
deeply in common, whereas the Hegelian leftists have something deeply different that really

03:32:54.320 --> 03:33:00.240
should be horrifying. So there is actually a natural allyship between the liberals and

03:33:00.240 --> 03:33:03.840
conservatives. We could talk about it theologically if you want. My three guys of the west would

03:33:03.840 --> 03:33:12.000
argue, for example, that this Judeo-Christian conservative God, just again, Tempot explanation

03:33:12.000 --> 03:33:18.080
and this kind of Jeffersonian liberal God have as presuppositions a God that is,

03:33:19.040 --> 03:33:25.840
in the God is Alpha and Omega, I am the I am, whereas Hegel has this leftism, has this God

03:33:25.840 --> 03:33:31.520
that becomes through their activism, justifying, you know, ends justify the means and so on.

03:33:32.080 --> 03:33:37.120
So summarizing that idea, again, very briefly, leftist conservatives with their two so-called

03:33:37.120 --> 03:33:40.800
deities as representatives approach the divine with humility. That's what's something they

03:33:40.800 --> 03:33:46.080
have in common. They're humble before something bigger than we are. That's incomprehensible

03:33:46.080 --> 03:33:51.120
to us. It's ultimately well beyond us, whereas leftists don't have this with their Hegelian

03:33:51.120 --> 03:33:57.760
deity and their faith and the Hegelian faith behind them that's fueled up in praxis. They

03:33:57.760 --> 03:34:02.160
actually approach what they believe is the divine with arrogance, because their goal is to bring

03:34:02.160 --> 03:34:08.240
their own vision into being and make it lord through their machinations and activism. This is

03:34:08.240 --> 03:34:13.200
the reason that a lot of the kind of far far right conservative Christians identify it with

03:34:13.200 --> 03:34:19.680
Luciferianism or Satanism, because that's exactly the kind of thing that those ideas are supposed

03:34:19.680 --> 03:34:25.760
to reflect. It is a very arrogant belief, though, that you're going to bring about the

03:34:25.760 --> 03:34:31.520
actualization of God through your activism and compared to the humility of whether it's

03:34:32.400 --> 03:34:37.680
God the father of the Judeo-Christian tradition or whether it's the world as it is

03:34:39.040 --> 03:34:44.560
beyond and bigger than us with all that humility that's a complete departure. So liberals and

03:34:44.560 --> 03:34:47.600
conservatives should be teaming up against leftists. That's one thing to understand from

03:34:47.600 --> 03:34:54.960
understanding what's going on here. So ultimately, my goal here has been to make clear what's going

03:34:54.960 --> 03:35:00.240
on with the woke left and most of the left over the last 200 years, old left, new left, woke left,

03:35:00.960 --> 03:35:04.880
which exists in a single current. That's what I'm trying to argue, a single current in which Marx

03:35:04.880 --> 03:35:14.000
is just one species, Lenin, Stalin, Mao. These are woke precursors. Wokeness is Leninism 4.0,

03:35:14.080 --> 03:35:20.080
as I've argued elsewhere. Bio-Leninism is other people have argued kind of taking a page out of

03:35:20.080 --> 03:35:25.040
Foucault by saying that when you have scientific technocracy involved, technocratic elements

03:35:25.040 --> 03:35:30.240
where it's bio-something, and it's Leninism driven through technocratic means of bio-Leninism.

03:35:30.240 --> 03:35:35.200
These are all just threads in the same line of thought. There's all one religion, and that

03:35:35.200 --> 03:35:40.080
religion is comprehensible, and it's defeasible when it's understood because it's intrinsically weak.

03:35:40.640 --> 03:35:44.720
It consistently fails to have the evidence, it doesn't have the argument, and it completely

03:35:44.720 --> 03:35:49.440
lacks the moral high ground once you understand what it is. And faith is ultimately the Hegelian

03:35:49.440 --> 03:35:56.320
dialectical faith, which is ultimately alchemical in nature, hermetic in nature, as I've been

03:35:56.320 --> 03:36:01.520
arguing on Twitter and people get pissed off at me when I do. So one more thing, what can we do

03:36:01.520 --> 03:36:06.000
with this idea that I've summarized is that to beat the dialectical left requires understanding

03:36:06.000 --> 03:36:11.200
that it is dialectical, and then not getting dragged into the dialectic. It seeks to make

03:36:11.200 --> 03:36:16.400
something out of nothing, so you don't play along with it. You don't go along, you don't believe

03:36:16.400 --> 03:36:20.720
that you can make something out of nothing, or that you can create positive or success out of

03:36:20.720 --> 03:36:24.720
negation. That's absolutely ridiculous where you have Markuza arguing that the negative thinking

03:36:24.720 --> 03:36:31.680
leads to positive. None of this will work. They literally think that the golden era is inside

03:36:31.680 --> 03:36:36.720
of a shell of oppression. If we just rip all the oppression off, the golden era will blossom out.

03:36:36.720 --> 03:36:40.800
This doesn't work. So what do you have to do practically as an individual or an institution

03:36:40.800 --> 03:36:44.720
is you have to avoid the dialectic. You have to stay out of it. I did a whole podcast on my other

03:36:45.280 --> 03:36:50.480
podcast. I have private contributors only where I compared it to alligators or crocodiles that

03:36:50.480 --> 03:36:54.400
drag you under the water and roll you. They throw out a dialectical bid. You need to learn to

03:36:54.400 --> 03:36:59.760
recognize these, and you learn to not participate. If you cave in, you bend the knee, you give in,

03:37:00.480 --> 03:37:05.200
you grant their presuppositions, you try to argue back or whatever, they drag you into the mud.

03:37:05.200 --> 03:37:10.560
Your options then are to mock it if that's appropriate and to get kind of funny about it,

03:37:10.560 --> 03:37:16.160
or to, as I've argued in yet another podcast, to engage their Mott and Bailey as it's called

03:37:16.160 --> 03:37:20.400
rhetorical strategy, steal their Mott, which means make the core of their argument, their

03:37:20.400 --> 03:37:25.680
kernel, the truth of their argument better than they can, and then bomb the Bailey, which is to

03:37:25.680 --> 03:37:30.640
say destroy their activist agenda. If we put it in the language of this hermetic alchemical thing,

03:37:30.640 --> 03:37:33.600
you're going to go in and you're going to say, yeah, you're right. Okay, it turned out there is a

03:37:33.600 --> 03:37:38.160
little nugget of gold inside your big lump of lead, and I'm going to take the gold out for you.

03:37:38.160 --> 03:37:41.440
That's going to be mine, and I'm going to point out why everything else you have is lead and know

03:37:41.440 --> 03:37:47.280
you're not going to turn that into gold. Steal the Mott, bomb the Bailey. Those are your only

03:37:47.280 --> 03:37:52.240
things you can do. You have to find other modes of engagement like mockery or this very kind of

03:37:52.240 --> 03:37:57.680
savvy steal the Mott, bomb the Bailey, or you have to just stand in your principles. A little

03:37:57.680 --> 03:38:02.720
bit of chauvinism won't hurt too much, refusing to bend the knee, refusing to participate,

03:38:05.440 --> 03:38:10.080
forcing them to play on neutral terms, make them define their terms, etc., so that you can stay out

03:38:10.080 --> 03:38:14.880
of their dialectic word games and so on. But also, you have to learn to start seeing and

03:38:14.880 --> 03:38:18.640
anticipating their moves and manipulations, which you can do once you understand that they are

03:38:18.640 --> 03:38:23.680
operating from a dialectical frame and under the belief that they're saving the world,

03:38:23.680 --> 03:38:30.080
that they're bringing about a utopia through their actions. So, remember, don't fall for it.

03:38:30.640 --> 03:38:37.440
Their negative, alphabin, demolish, deconstruct, disrupt, dismantle process

03:38:38.320 --> 03:38:48.560
cannot create. It can only destroy or spend. Harvard University is my favorite example

03:38:48.640 --> 03:38:54.160
of this right now. I just saw a thing on Twitter talking about how 40% of its professors are worried

03:38:54.160 --> 03:38:59.680
that its brand is losing status. Yeah, it is massively. It's a freaking clown college. Harvard

03:38:59.680 --> 03:39:05.360
University is almost 400 years old. It's burned through something like 380 years or something

03:39:05.360 --> 03:39:12.400
like this of excellent top notch, top grade branding in just a few years by taking all this

03:39:12.400 --> 03:39:18.400
woke crap on. It only took it like four or five years, but really just the last year,

03:39:18.400 --> 03:39:24.240
to burn down 400 years. And all it did was enable a few people to grift and a few ideas to get pushed

03:39:24.240 --> 03:39:29.440
out with imprimatur that the imprimatur is going to collapse under its own way. This is the same.

03:39:29.440 --> 03:39:33.360
All the communists or all of history, all of the neo-Marxists, all history, all of them,

03:39:33.360 --> 03:39:38.400
they all do this. They infiltrate some, whether it's an economic institution,

03:39:38.400 --> 03:39:43.440
whether it's a cultural institution, they infiltrate it, they spend, spend, spend, spend,

03:39:43.440 --> 03:39:47.600
spend, and eventually they burn the thing to the ground because they don't produce anything. And

03:39:47.600 --> 03:39:51.120
they have to move on to some new thing to get other people to produce for them because you

03:39:51.120 --> 03:39:57.520
can't create through a negation process. Alf Haven doesn't make. Critical theory doesn't build.

03:39:57.520 --> 03:40:01.440
Critical theory doesn't even understand. It has no obligation to understand. It has only the

03:40:01.440 --> 03:40:08.160
obligation for Alf Haven to cooter. It only has the obligation to tear down. So if you're in the

03:40:08.240 --> 03:40:13.520
position where you're looking at this woke nonsense or anything related to it, think twice.

03:40:13.520 --> 03:40:18.080
You're not going to do better in your organization. Harvard University burned through its branding.

03:40:18.080 --> 03:40:22.720
In a couple of years, you're not going to do better. Coca-Cola and the Department of Backoff,

03:40:22.720 --> 03:40:27.760
after they tried to say B less white, Disney's starting to fold. Everything is big. It doesn't

03:40:27.760 --> 03:40:31.840
matter how big they are. The federal government of the United States is a laughing stock right now

03:40:31.840 --> 03:40:35.920
because they're trying to force this crap both in the critical race theory direction and the

03:40:35.920 --> 03:40:43.120
trans direction. Are you out of your mind? Don't take it up. It will burn you to the ground so fast

03:40:43.120 --> 03:40:49.120
and it will use you to advance its interests, to grift a little bit, to push its narrative a little

03:40:49.120 --> 03:40:55.120
bit further and burn all of your hard-earned cultural, social, and economic capital to the

03:40:55.120 --> 03:40:59.520
ground because it can't build. That's all it does. Constant negativity in pursuit of the

03:40:59.520 --> 03:41:04.720
magical emergence of the great or the good after all the negative is so-called destroyed

03:41:04.720 --> 03:41:10.480
is not going to create good. That's not how it works. Building the good takes actual work.

03:41:10.480 --> 03:41:13.840
You actually have to know what you're doing. You actually have to take some risks. You actually

03:41:13.840 --> 03:41:18.960
have to do some hard things. Good must be built up and then it must be maintained and defended

03:41:18.960 --> 03:41:26.000
and the dialectic cannot do this. It is a process of negating, not building. It can only destroy

03:41:26.000 --> 03:41:31.920
and spend. It's central article of faith which is that hermetic alchemical belief that things

03:41:31.920 --> 03:41:37.200
will purify and perfect is ultimately wrong. It's bad theory. Bad theory put into practice

03:41:37.200 --> 03:41:43.680
makes bad results. So you need to understand that the goal of the dialectic is not in fact

03:41:43.680 --> 03:41:48.480
to create at all. So this is why you shouldn't adopt it. If you understand this as a religion,

03:41:48.480 --> 03:41:54.160
you understand its goal is to win. Its goal is to take over, to gain dominance. We heard that from

03:41:54.160 --> 03:42:01.680
them themselves. This is why the dialectical left is and always has been power obsessed

03:42:01.680 --> 03:42:06.960
and seeks to seize the means of the idea, economic, cultural, linguistic, discursive,

03:42:06.960 --> 03:42:12.880
or whatever production in society. Its objective is not understanding its operational success.

03:42:12.880 --> 03:42:18.960
Its goal is not to create or to build. It is to win, to seize power and to foist as much of its

03:42:18.960 --> 03:42:24.800
agenda on the world as it can before it burns out. So to close, I'm going to do something quite

03:42:24.800 --> 03:42:28.720
controversial. I'm going to quote from a figure you're not allowed to drag into these kinds of

03:42:28.720 --> 03:42:35.360
things named George Soros in his 1992 book called The Alchemy of Finance. He writes the following,

03:42:35.360 --> 03:42:40.880
I think you'll see the Hegel in this. Or if you're a scholar of Horkheimer, you'll see the critical

03:42:40.880 --> 03:42:46.640
versus traditional theory thing in this. He writes, the scientific method seeks to understand things

03:42:46.640 --> 03:42:52.720
as they are while alchemy seeks to bring about a desired state of affairs. To put it another way,

03:42:52.720 --> 03:43:00.400
the primary objective of science is truth, that of alchemy operational success. That's George Soros

03:43:01.040 --> 03:43:05.360
writing in a book about finance where he explained basically how he was able to

03:43:05.360 --> 03:43:11.200
crash and short the pound sterling. He didn't build the British economy. He damaged the British

03:43:11.200 --> 03:43:19.280
economy and grifted off of it. Same process. Alchemy is the method. His tool is called reflexivity.

03:43:19.280 --> 03:43:24.560
If you want to look up what that is, we're not going to get into that whole second side discussion.

03:43:26.480 --> 03:43:32.240
But this is the fundamental difference then between Hegelian alchemy and liberalism or even

03:43:32.240 --> 03:43:39.440
conservatism. And it's the same difference that you see in the Neo-Marxist critical theorists

03:43:39.440 --> 03:43:44.080
that they put between traditional and critical theory. I could reread Soros' statement that way.

03:43:45.840 --> 03:43:50.160
The traditional theory seeks to understand things as they are while critical theory

03:43:50.160 --> 03:43:54.000
seeks to bring about a desired state of affairs. To put it another way, the primary objective

03:43:54.000 --> 03:44:00.080
of traditional theory is truth, that of critical theory operational success. We could probably say

03:44:00.080 --> 03:44:04.880
this in Hegelian language. For Stan to seek to understand things as they are,

03:44:04.960 --> 03:44:09.120
well, Vernunft seeks to bring about a desired state of affairs. To put it another way,

03:44:09.120 --> 03:44:15.840
the primary objective of Verstand is truth, that of Vernunft is operational success.

03:44:17.440 --> 03:44:22.240
This is the same thing that Marx dragged up then in the difference between Wiesen-Schacht

03:44:22.240 --> 03:44:28.480
and Wiesen-Schacht-Lichter-Sozialism. I can't say German. We're just going to

03:44:28.480 --> 03:44:34.000
Sozialism based on his critical philosophy. So critical philosophy becomes the thing here.

03:44:34.000 --> 03:44:37.280
We could put this in. Science seeks to understand things as they are,

03:44:37.280 --> 03:44:40.640
while critical philosophy seeks to bring about a desired state of affairs.

03:44:41.920 --> 03:44:45.600
The other two, the philosophers, have only sought to understand a world. The point is to

03:44:45.600 --> 03:44:50.160
change it. To put it another way, the primary objective of critical philosophy is, or sorry,

03:44:50.160 --> 03:44:55.040
the primary objective of science is truth, that of critical philosophy, operational success.

03:44:56.240 --> 03:44:59.840
Again, it's the same thing as Hegel saw between Verstand and Vernunft,

03:45:00.640 --> 03:45:05.280
understanding and reason, which meant the application of a systematic philosophy to

03:45:05.280 --> 03:45:08.960
perfect the ideas of the world according to his own program and thought. Finally,

03:45:09.520 --> 03:45:17.280
yet tremendous length. I think we're just closing up on four hours. I have discussed Hegel. As I

03:45:17.280 --> 03:45:23.200
told you I would, Hegel's relevance to the woke. My claim that the woke is ultimately a hermetic,

03:45:23.200 --> 03:45:32.640
meaning alchemical, religion, based in Hegelian philosophy, rooted in the dialectical process.

03:45:33.200 --> 03:45:40.000
Proceeding by the by the neo-Marxist objective of Alphabander Coulter, I believe is now

03:45:41.200 --> 03:45:45.120
absolutely established. I think I know what I'm talking about when I say that. I don't think

03:45:45.120 --> 03:45:51.280
I'm making it up. I think we have a 200-year-long trajectory of this line of thought stretching

03:45:51.280 --> 03:45:57.600
back at least to the young Hegelians, if not Hegel himself. This project has progressed for 200

03:45:57.600 --> 03:46:04.080
years. It has caused nothing but calamity everywhere it obtains power. It's attempting to obtain power

03:46:04.080 --> 03:46:09.760
through wokeness in the United States and throughout the West today. We should not let that happen.

03:46:11.120 --> 03:46:15.760
My practical advice is that people who identify themselves broadly as liberal,

03:46:15.760 --> 03:46:19.440
and people who identify themselves as conservatives, should find ways to put their

03:46:19.440 --> 03:46:25.120
differences aside, form an alliance, and start pushing out the Hegelian dialectical

03:46:25.120 --> 03:46:29.760
leftists. When I say push them out, I mean push them out of positions of power,

03:46:29.760 --> 03:46:34.560
push them out of positions of influence, which they can only abuse and waste.

03:46:35.600 --> 03:46:42.560
There's my summary of how Hegel is the roots of a huge religious movement that has been

03:46:42.560 --> 03:46:49.120
going for 200 years. The woke are its most evangelistic and puritanical eruption

03:46:49.920 --> 03:46:54.480
so far in history. That's why I've compared them. Many of them are, in fact, in the United

03:46:54.480 --> 03:47:00.400
States at least, coming from a tradition of lapsed Calvinism. They filled in their Calvinist roots

03:47:01.760 --> 03:47:07.360
where the Puritanism comes out of. With this woke ideology as the new operating system,

03:47:07.440 --> 03:47:13.920
they've adopted a Hegelian faith. If you are a Christian, I hope you are perfectly clear now on

03:47:13.920 --> 03:47:19.600
why anything in this kind of critical social justice, critical theory, critical race theory,

03:47:19.600 --> 03:47:25.600
et cetera, line of thought is heretical to the Christian faith as it's been traditionally or

03:47:25.600 --> 03:47:31.680
in reformed circles practiced. You do not believe in a God that is becoming, that is actualized through

03:47:31.680 --> 03:47:36.400
the activities of human beings. You believe in a God that is and is transcendent. You do not believe

03:47:36.400 --> 03:47:40.800
in a trinity where one part feeds into another and creates a spiral through utopia at the end of

03:47:40.800 --> 03:47:46.720
the world. You believe in a God that created the world three pieces are co-eternal and perfect

03:47:46.720 --> 03:47:52.320
and that only He knows the hour of the eschaton. It is an absolute heresy to believe that you can

03:47:52.320 --> 03:47:56.320
somehow combine these. As a matter of fact, just for a last note for my Christian friends,

03:47:56.320 --> 03:48:01.120
it is a dialectical process, just like we've been talking about, to believe that you can.

03:48:01.120 --> 03:48:05.920
So what you would have is Christian faith as it is. Let's bring in something like critical race

03:48:05.920 --> 03:48:11.440
theory as an antithesis, a Hegelian faith, and then let's try to find a synthesis. But the synthesis

03:48:11.440 --> 03:48:16.640
of anything in a Hegelian thing is going to be Hegelian. So you've already been dragged into a

03:48:16.640 --> 03:48:23.680
heretical frame. So Christians need to absolutely repel this on theological grounds. Everybody else

03:48:23.680 --> 03:48:28.320
and Christians need to reject this on ethical grounds, on reasonable grounds, on evidentiary

03:48:28.320 --> 03:48:34.720
grounds, on just everyday good people common sense grounds, and on the sense of knowing that our

03:48:34.720 --> 03:48:39.680
society was premised on the fact that, again, just to bring this up again, it's so important

03:48:39.680 --> 03:48:47.600
that rights, this is the Lockean frame, the liberal view that rights are granted by the creator,

03:48:47.600 --> 03:48:51.840
we are endowed by a creator with inalienable rights. They are not privileges to be granted

03:48:51.840 --> 03:48:58.480
by a state that we are totally to subvert ourselves to. And that's the Hegelian view. So

03:48:58.480 --> 03:49:02.960
we're going to reject statism, we're going to reject collectivism, and we're going to defend

03:49:02.960 --> 03:49:09.600
the values that have made everything work throughout the West for just as long,

03:49:09.600 --> 03:49:13.120
or if not longer, than these two centuries of Hegelian religion.
