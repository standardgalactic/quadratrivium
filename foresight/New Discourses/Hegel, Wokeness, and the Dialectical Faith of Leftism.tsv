0	24640	Hey everyone, this is James Lindsay, you are listening to the New Discourses podcast.
24640	30000	And finally, after months of anticipation, after many times on Twitter of this blowing
30000	33040	up, I want to talk to you about Hegel.
33040	39280	I've been promising to talk about the Hegelian idea for a while, I've been tweeting about
39280	40280	it.
40280	43360	Something peculiar happens every time you tweet about Hegel and you get too close.
43360	49640	For example, if you point out that wokeism is a Hegelian religion, especially if you
49640	57800	point out that wokeism is a hermetic religion based in the dialectical philosophy of Hegel.
57800	60440	Something weird happens, people go berserk.
60440	66080	You end up or I end up at least getting bombed by people in kind of disproportionate fashion
66080	69880	and something very inorganic begins to happen in many of these cases.
69880	74800	Of course, there's a usual making fun of me, but lots of very obviously leftist accounts
74800	77440	kind of lose their mind, pop up on my radar.
77440	81760	And what will happen is stuff that's just not quite real, something that's hyper real
81760	82760	in a sense.
82760	89640	And that'll be that somebody will throw a dunk and somebody with maybe just a few dozen
89640	98480	followers will reply to something maybe in dunk fashion and a reply tweet from an account
98480	102920	that's not very big will somehow get hundreds of likes sometimes in a very small amount
102920	103920	of time.
103920	104920	It's not organic behavior.
104920	111640	Something weird going on with Hegel and this has driven me to want to understand more of
111640	112640	Hegel.
112640	116520	Hegel is of course relevant to everybody who knows much about Marx knows that Hegel is
116520	120320	relevant to Marx and I want to make the case that Hegel is relevant to what's going on
120320	126360	and in fact that we can understand the woke ideology or woke worldview as a better way
126360	133640	to put it, the worldview of critical social justice also known as theory as a Hegelian
133760	135040	faith.
135040	139600	And so to begin, this is probably going to go pretty long because I want to do this
139600	140600	in depth.
140600	142320	I want to get it all there.
142320	144040	I have copious notes for this.
144040	149440	I want to just read to you something that might not stick out to you otherwise from
149440	151120	critical race theory and introduction.
151120	154040	This is by Richard Delgado and Jean Stefansic.
154040	158320	It's a typical fundamental textbook in critical race theory.
158320	162080	And I've quoted from it about a bajillion times.
162080	169560	So I just want to read to you this paragraph in the section about essentialism and anti-essentialism.
169560	170560	They write,
170560	175080	Some observers hold that all minority races should compromise their differences and form
175080	178480	a united front against racism in general.
178480	183080	The danger in this essentialized approach is that certain minority groups, socioeconomic
183080	188960	classes and sexual orientations may end up better off and others worse.
188960	193000	Tell how shabbily black women were treated in the civil rights movement of the 1960s,
193000	196560	rarely allowed to speak for the group, made to march in the second row, and relegated
196560	199080	with a few exceptions to support roles.
199080	204600	It has only been relatively recently that black women in Latinas have emerged as powerful
204600	207600	voices on the American scene.
207600	212680	Perhaps the essentialism slash anti-essentialism debate sets in when mainstream thought is
212680	217400	beginning to see the validity in the larger groups' complaints.
217400	221560	Like an automobile with deferred maintenance, smaller subgroups that have until then remained
221560	226880	silent begin bringing suppressed issues to the larger groups' attention.
226880	231360	And so the dialectic progresses.
231360	235360	That's the end of the quote, but let's check that last part.
235360	238640	And so the dialectic progresses.
238640	242360	That word, dialectic, is not there by mistake.
242360	246160	Neither is the idea that's put forth with the dialectic that it's progressing and in
246160	251080	fact neither is the idea that it's progressing into a smaller and more niche area.
251080	257400	So what the argument here is that they're making in this last sentence is that as larger
257400	262320	scale problems seem to be getting sorted out, smaller scale problems get brought up to
262320	268320	the fore and have to be worked out as well, and so the dialectic progresses.
268320	270120	None of this is there by mistake.
270120	274440	So in this episode of the podcast, I want to convince you of two primary things.
274440	279360	They're going to be kind of my north star, I suppose, in communicating this stuff to
279360	280360	you.
280360	283440	One, this idea of dialectic is important.
283440	290240	In fact, it is the operating system of leftists and it has been for almost 200 years.
290240	295160	It's so important that if you don't understand this seemingly quirky word and where it comes
295160	300680	from philosophically, you don't have the slightest idea of what's going on in leftist politics.
301240	307520	Secondly, this dialectic is a method of worship and a broad religious movement that started
307520	312640	primarily with Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel in the early 19th century.
312640	318760	A phenomenology of spirit in 1807 is probably a good bookmark to say when this started.
318760	323160	So we're looking at 214 years since the publication of that book.
323160	327920	His later writings extend into the late 1820s.
327920	331720	So we're looking at roughly 200 years ago.
331720	338840	That broad Hegelian religion has denominations that include Marxism, Neo-Marxism, also known
338840	344360	as critical theory or cultural Marxism, Fabianism, and Wokeness.
344360	345920	So I want to convince you of these two things.
345920	352800	The dialectic is the operating system of leftism and that leftism that's operating dialectically
352800	359680	is in fact a religion that can be traced back to the metaphysics of Hegel.
359680	363440	That's a tall order, but I think it's crucial if you want to understand what's going on
363440	368960	with the woke, why it appears to be religious, why it has many of the features that it does.
368960	372920	If you want to be able to anticipate the moves that it makes, if you want to be able to counter it,
372920	375680	you have to understand it.
375680	379600	The Polish proverb is never attempt to cure that which you don't understand, so I want
379600	386480	to make sure we understand that leftism, in particular this kind of radical leftism,
386480	392160	the line of Marxism, Neo-Marxism, Fabianism, and Wokeness that have really characterized
392160	398960	leftism over the past 200 years, or at least 150 years, starting with Marxism, I guess.
398960	406080	Those are all species within a broader or denominations within a broader religious movement
406080	413680	that relies upon the dialectical approach laid out first in significance by Hegel.
413680	417960	So the rough picture I want to paint, we could go back, the dialectic really finds its first
417960	422840	expression in Kant, we're not going to talk about Kant.
422840	427120	It was developed further by Fichte, we're also not going to talk about Fichte, and there
427120	431560	Hegel picks up the story, so we're going to start with Hegel.
431560	434040	If you want to know more about those other things, you can talk to my friend Stephen
434080	439000	Hicks, or you can listen to or read his book, I listened to it, so I automatically went
439000	441200	to the audiobook explaining postmodernism.
441200	446120	He has some of the relevance of Hegel and Fichte, a number of other thinkers that led
446120	448920	up to before Hegel, but I'm going to begin with Hegel.
448920	453880	So what happened is that Hegel eventually died, but a movement, he was really an electoral
453880	462520	rock star at the time where he was in Germany, and a movement arose around him, or actually
462520	467480	a few movements arose around his systematic philosophy, and the progressive one of these
467480	470240	was known as the Young Hegelian Movement.
470240	474360	The Young Hegelian Movement is what inspired Marx, and Marxism became the definition of
474360	479480	basically everything leftism following Marx, but especially following the success of the
479480	486800	Russian Revolution, it was voiced by Lenin, it also gave rise to Neo-Marxism, and approximately
486800	492400	in a kind of odd and broken way postmodernism, and of course my thesis in cynical theories
492480	496640	which I wrote with Helen Pluckrose, is that Neo-Marxism and postmodernism fused with a
496640	500160	few other things that were going on to form what we now call woke.
500160	506800	So we have this line, Hegel to the Young Hegelian Movement, to Marx via Fauerbach, to Neo-Marxism
506800	511160	and to some degree postmodernism in sort of a broken way to woke, and we have this long
511160	516640	thread running of this one religion that's taking different denominational forms as it's
516640	517880	going through time.
517880	522360	You could say that the woke are in some sense, you could say that in fact in some odd sense
522480	528200	the Neo-Marxists are almost like it's Calvinists or even the woke are like it's Puritans.
528200	531720	If you read something like Robin D'Angelo's wife fragility and you're aware of what a
531720	535600	Puritan confessional tract looks like where they're going through their humiliation after
535600	538600	they believe that they've been saved, it's pretty obvious.
538600	543040	Robin D'Angelo feels as though she has been saved in an anti-racist religion, she knows
543040	547760	that racism is bad, that she feels like she's done the proper atonement that she should
547760	552880	have received grace but because it's a Puritan mindset that she's operating within, she's
552880	557720	got scrupulosity probably which is a form of OCD if I had to guess, can't diagnose her
557720	559280	for sure.
559280	565320	She enters into this humiliation where she tries to repeatedly show that she's utterly
565320	570960	depraved and therefore going to be able to be worthy of justification and then eventually
570960	573080	glorification.
574080	575880	This is the mindset of the woke.
575880	580280	You can see this is a very religious way when you read Robin D'Angelo if you're familiar
580280	582200	with Puritan tracts.
582200	587000	The big idea, there are lots of big ideas in Hegel, lots of things going on.
587000	591920	I want to follow that particular track, Hegel to the Young Hegelian Movement, to Marx to
591920	596560	Neo-Marxism and Postmodernism in a broken way, to the woke.
596560	601080	The one that I want to focus on centrally is this operating system that Hegel laid out
601080	607160	in an applicative way probably for the first time, which is the dialectic.
607160	609680	Dialectic is thesis, antithesis, synthesis.
609680	611320	Those are the words usually here.
611320	616240	You have some idea that's a thesis, you're met with its opposite, that's the antithesis.
616240	620160	You have to contemplate the two, figure out a way to bring them together into something
620160	626600	that unifies the ideas and that's a synthesis that's supposed to provide more information.
626960	632600	A higher understanding is a better way to phrase that, I'm sorry, of the circumstance.
632600	637560	The thesis is an idea that has been forwarded, it misses something, its antithesis reveals
637560	642760	the contradictions from what it's missing and its synthesis arrives out of this.
642760	644760	This can be traced back to Socratic thought.
644760	650960	There are positive and negative versions of this note.
650960	656520	I suppose we should say that Hegel never actually framed the dialectic this way as thesis, antithesis
657120	661200	that's Kant's organization, Hegel borrowed from Kant.
661200	665240	His own formulation was actually abstract negative concrete, so you have an abstract
665240	669560	idea, abstract understanding of something, it meets its negative and that allows you
669560	675240	to derive something concrete from it, which is clearly reflected in the Neo-Marxist literature
675240	680560	repeatedly if you've read it because the Neo-Marxist literature constantly calls for engaging in
680600	687280	so-called negative thinking and negative thinking is bringing that negative to bear, which is
687280	692240	the critique Marx's ruthless criticism of everything that exists that's bringing the
692240	697840	negative to bear on the abstract so that you can synthesize it to the concrete, which
697840	702200	is a concrete solution, which usually for them means something looking like communism.
702200	707280	You can hear this verbiage for example, just to pull one example out of Herbert Marcuse,
707360	712240	I've read Herbert Marcuse's repressive tolerance essay before, I've read selections from his
712240	715680	one-dimensional man, we're going to cover some of both of those again in this episode,
716800	721440	but in his 1969 essay on liberation, which I intend to read for the podcast in full
721440	728800	with commentary fairly soon, I have not read that one yet, but we encounter this paragraph.
729600	736720	Marcuse writes, but the demand to state the concrete alternatives to, say, the failing
736720	740800	states of the world, capitalist states, particularly that he's looking at, but also
740800	744160	the failures of attempted socialist and communist states, he says,
744160	749040	but the demand to state the concrete alternatives is justified for yet another reason.
749760	755920	Negative thinking, there it is, draws whatever force it may have from its empirical basis,
755920	760560	the actual human condition in the given society. So he's like, let's look at the lived experiences,
760560	764480	look where suffering and oppression are, let's tap into those, and we're going to use negative
764480	768400	thinking to do so, and it's empirical because we're looking at the actual experiences people
768400	772720	are having, the actual human condition. And then you're going to compare that, he writes,
772720	779040	and the given possibilities to transcend this condition, to enlarge the realm of freedom.
780320	786320	In this sense, negative thinking is by virtue of its own internal concepts positive. Negative
786320	793680	thinking is positive. Isn't that odd? What he says that means is oriented toward and
793680	798400	comprehending a future which is contained in the present. This containment idea is going to
798400	804000	be very important also that this perfect future, the negative thinking can unleash,
804000	807840	is contained in the present. The philosophy here, the metaphysic here is actually that if we could
807840	815680	just get the problems off of that contained future, then the contained future could emerge.
817520	821920	So what we have here is somebody believing that there's this kind of perfect future,
822000	826080	and if we could just get the problems off of it by using negative thinking, we could peel away
826080	831040	all the problematics, we could expose all the contradictions, we could expose all of the systems
831040	837120	of oppression that prevent it from being perfect, then that seed that's contained within in the
837120	841520	present day would be able to blossom into a fully liberated society. That's the essay on liberation.
843520	847040	That's a very important way. We're going to come back to this again and again. It's a very important
847040	850880	way to understand the way that these people think, and it's crucial to understand that this is a
850880	859600	Hegelian approach. But to go back to Marcuse, he writes, and this containment, which is an
859600	863840	important aspect of the general containment policy pursued by the established societies,
864960	870160	oh sorry, and in this containment, the future appears as possible liberation. So that's what
870160	875200	I was just saying. In the contained within the society, we see the seed of liberation,
875200	879680	the seed of a new society that cannot and does not exist anywhere on earth up to this point.
880320	885360	And he writes, it is not the only alternative, the advent of a long period of civilized barbarism
885920	889600	with or without the nuclear destruction is equally contained in the present. So there
889600	895040	could be good roads or bad roads. Negative thinking and the praxis guided by it is the
895040	900960	positive and positing effort to prevent this utter negativity. So he frames out negative
900960	907680	thinking as positive, and he says that it allows us to peel away the constraints
908480	915040	of a civilized barbarism in the established societies, peel away the problematics, and get
915040	922560	the seed of a more perfected future using negative thinking and the praxis guided by it. Praxis is
922560	929920	what you have when you combine theory, meaning really Hegelian reason, as we're going to see,
929920	934400	but we could say critical theory, we could say postmodern theory, we could say woke or theory,
934400	939520	if you want, what we just call capital T theory, put into practice. That's what praxis is,
939520	945760	it's theory combined with being put into practice. So it's activism on behalf of a theoretical or
945760	951760	ideological model. Well, when we take negative thinking, and we do activism on behalf of that,
952480	957200	then this negative thinking becomes positive because it prevents us from going into the
957200	961520	possible calamities that are also contained in the seed of a more perfect liberated future
961520	967040	could possibly blossom. It's very important, as you'll see, to understand that this is how
967920	972880	this Hegelian religion thinks. Perfected society, we already have the seeds of it,
972880	977520	and we just have to somehow peel away the problems, and then the perfected society will
977520	982320	emerge. If you've listened to my other recent podcast, Communism Doesn't Know How, I go into this
982320	986160	kind of magical thinking that they have, and I actually describe it as alchemical, and you're
986160	990720	going to find out why I describe it as alchemical again and again as we go through this longer
991520	998640	discussion of Hegel and his relevance. So this said, I think we already see then that to understand
998640	1005120	both the leftism over the last 200 years, but also Hegel's relevance to that, we have to grapple
1005120	1011200	with this idea of the dialectic. Because this is, as I said, the operating system beneath all of
1011200	1019200	leftism, at least since Hegel's time. And it really emerged in the form that we're looking at
1019200	1023920	in leftism from the progressive school of thought that followed him in the 1820s and 1830s. This
1023920	1028880	referred to as young Hegelianism. Young Hegelianism, I'm not going to dive deeply into this because
1028880	1034880	I want to get to Marx and the Neo-Marxists, etc. But in the woke, young Hegelianism has to be
1034880	1040640	distinguished from old Hegelianism. So Hegel is not particularly easy to decipher, if you haven't
1040640	1047120	read him. He can be quite difficult to decipher, actually. And so radically different interpretations
1047120	1053600	of Hegel erupted in the wake of Hegel's later years in death, one of which is young Hegelianism,
1053600	1058720	which was rampantly progressive, and one of which was old Hegelianism, which was ultra-conservative.
1059360	1063760	In essence, very briefly, Hegel's philosophy, his systematic philosophy that he laid out,
1063760	1070320	was supposed to describe the emergence of a perfected state and perfected society
1071040	1077120	through the perfection of ideas. And the young Hegelians looked around at the world that they
1077120	1081280	lived in in the 1820s and 1830s in Prussia and said, we're not there yet. There are all kinds
1081280	1084880	of problems the dialectic has to be applied to. There are all kinds of contradictions
1085600	1091520	in our experience. Whereas the old Hegelians, being ultra-conservative, looked at the state of
1091520	1096960	society they lived in and said, aha, Hegel was saying that we're already there. And so Hegel's
1096960	1103760	dialectic had already fully achieved what it had aimed to do, the absolute as Hegel had it,
1103760	1109600	and thus the perfected state of society, already had realized itself and emerged in
1109600	1114560	Prussia at the time, which would then demand that in the sense that history had ended,
1115440	1120080	capital H history. And so absolutely no change would be needed from this kind of historical
1120080	1127200	high point, which was a sort of proto-folkish national organization of the Prussian state
1127200	1132880	in the mid 19th century. So the young Hegelians have to be distinguished from this and that they
1132880	1138480	looked at this old Hegelian idea and thought, no, no way. There's all kinds of problems. And the
1138480	1146720	young Hegelians had a student within their ranks, Karl Marx. Karl Marx was a young Hegelian. He was
1146720	1150880	also influenced by other thinkers, as we'll discuss, who were also in this kind of idealist
1150880	1159520	tradition. What do we have? Kant develops the dialectic, Fick to develops it further. This
1159520	1165920	inspires Schelling, who worked alongside, but not with Hegel. And both Schelling and Hegel were
1165920	1175360	profound influences on Marx. But nevertheless, Marx was actually a young Hegelian. And so we can
1175440	1183920	just turn to kind of understand the centrality of the dialectic, Hegel's dialectical application
1184640	1191680	to Marx by going to the marxist.org glossary. I love marxist.org. I love to read this. I love to
1191680	1195680	see the way the Marxists interpret these terms. It gives you tremendous, I'm writing an encyclopedia
1195680	1199840	on my own website on new discourses. So it gives me a tremendous insight into how these people
1199840	1204880	think about their own terms. Of course, the woke are different than the Marxists, but it does give
1205440	1210160	good historical insight and helps me open up my mind and understand how they use the terms in
1210160	1216880	multiple ways at once. But reading from the marxist.org glossary, the entry on Hegel, what they
1216880	1221120	write is the most important representative. This is describing Hegel, the most important
1221120	1227120	representative of classical German philosophy. He represented an objective idealism, a brilliant
1227120	1234000	investigator of the laws of dialectic, which he was the first consciously to apply.
1234240	1241840	Marxists today believe that Hegel began the dialectical application. That dialectical application
1241840	1247760	is what Marx turned into dialectical materialism, which is the mode by which Marxism progressed
1247760	1253040	and thought. Sort of the article of faith. It's like the religious engine of Marxism is dialectical
1253040	1258480	materialism. So we have the kind of just to summarize historically, we have Kant formulae
1258480	1263440	destructive of the dialectic. This was developed further by Fichte, and went on to inspire Shelling.
1263440	1267760	Also, Hegel would have been steeping in all this, and through both Hegel and Shelling,
1268640	1273440	and also the way the Faurbach had taken up from Hegel's thought within the Young Hegelian movement,
1275840	1280400	Marx was able to take all these ideas and create dialectical materialism by putting his own spin
1280400	1284480	on it. So Hegel took all these theoretical developments on the dialectic, and he saw it
1284480	1288800	to make them practical. That was what that's what the Marxists say. He was the first consciously
1288800	1294480	to apply the laws of dialectic. And of course, ironically enough, he did this dialectically,
1294480	1299040	or maybe it's not ironic, maybe it's necessary to how he would approach. He took the abstract,
1299040	1303440	remember his formulation wasn't thesis and synthesis, although we're going to kind of cling
1303440	1310400	to that because it's easy to understand his was abstract, negative, concrete. So he took the abstract
1310400	1317600	form of dialectic put forth by Kant, challenged it against its negative to arrive at a concrete
1317600	1322400	applicable form that the Marxists recognize he was the first to consciously apply. Apply to what?
1322400	1326480	To the changing of society. That's what Hegel really did. He figured out how to take this
1327280	1334720	for Kant. It's really a philosophical endeavor. It's something that's going on in the realm of
1334720	1341840	philosophy. It's something like what even maybe Socrates written down by Plato would have been
1341840	1346000	engaging. But it's really an article of philosophy, and it's a very useful one. We even talk about
1346000	1350400	this positively and how to have impossible conversations. Peter and I do the dialectic
1350400	1356640	of Hegel and Fichte, we mentioned. But really, it's Kant and Fichte. We really should have taken a
1356640	1362320	look at this more closely philosophically speaking, because theirs was a philosophical idea where we
1362320	1366800	can compare ideas against one another and find the flaws and try to figure out what we're missing
1366800	1371520	and reach a better understanding. And there is a conversational approach that philosophers
1371520	1376080	frequently use to improve their ideas. You can find that kind of referred to in the Bible under
1376080	1383200	iron sharpens iron. That's kind of a dialectical process that's abstract. It's a philosophical
1383200	1390160	endeavor. Well, on the other hand, Hegel had this idea that we're going to use this to create a
1390160	1395920	better society. We're going to change society using the dialectic by studying the ideas and the
1395920	1401200	shape of the state and the society itself and the spirit that it generates. So it's not just
1401200	1405200	philosophical inquiry anymore. He figures out how to apply it. So Hegel brings the laws of
1405200	1409760	dialectic into the world of application. So the beginning of praxis happens with Hegel.
1410400	1415840	The dialectical praxis, as it were, Marx goes on to name this after having adopted it and done
1415840	1422560	a number of things with it that we're going to get to. So central to all of Marxism then is this
1422560	1429040	dialectic and central to all of the left since Marx is Marxism. So the dialectic flies as the
1429040	1438400	operating system underwriting everything that's going on with the left over the last, I don't know,
1438480	1448560	200 years. So taking from marxist.org, we continue the quote Engels and Marx both on this idea.
1448560	1455440	So Engels wrote, they say in his review of Marx's, the critique of political economy,
1455440	1462560	this is Engels speaking or writing. The Hegelian method he writes, on the other hand, was in its
1462560	1471520	existing form quite inapplicable. So for Marx and Engels, who were creating communism, it wasn't
1471520	1479840	good enough. Even the now applied form of the dialectic is still quite inapplicable because,
1479840	1484640	as we'll see, he was too mystical. It was essentially idealist. This is back to Engels.
1485200	1490800	And the main point in this case was the elaboration of a world outlook that was more materialist than
1490800	1497760	any previous one. Hegel's method took as its point of departure pure thought, whereas here the
1497760	1502160	starting point was to be inexorable facts. So this is him describing the difference between
1502880	1509040	Marxist communism versus Hegelian dialectic. We're no longer going to engage in the realm of
1509040	1515440	pure thought. We're going to move into the realm of inexorable facts. Engels continues,
1515440	1520000	a method which, according to its own admission, quote, came from nothing through nothing to nothing
1520640	1527760	he's quoting Hegel in The Science of Logic, part one, section two. He says, this was by no means
1527760	1535600	appropriate here in this form. Here is to Marxism, to the political economy. Nevertheless,
1535600	1540960	all of the available logical material, of all the available logical material Engels writes,
1540960	1545360	it was the only piece which could be used at least as a starting point. So Hegel becomes a
1545360	1551840	starting point for what Marx wanted to do. It had not been criticized or overcome. Now one of the
1551840	1556480	opponents of the great dialectician had been able to make a breach in its proud structure. It fell
1556480	1561280	into oblivion because the Hegelian school had not the slightest notion of what to do with it. The
1561280	1566720	Hegelian school would be the young Hegelians here. It was therefore above all necessary to subject
1566720	1574160	the Hegelian method to thoroughgoing criticism. What distinguished Hegel's thought, Engels continues,
1574160	1578480	from that of all other philosophers, was the tremendous sense of the historical upon which
1578480	1583920	it was based. Abstract and idealist, though it was in form, yet the development of his thoughts
1583920	1589680	always proceeded parallel with the development of world history, and the latter is really meant
1589680	1596960	to be only the test of the former. In other words, Hegel's view was very historicist. He believed
1596960	1601520	that history had a trajectory, history had a telos, and if you don't understand how history is
1601520	1605120	moving, you don't really understand what's going on. And the dialectic is actually for Hegel the
1605120	1611840	thing that is moving history. So Engels continues, if thereby the real relation was inverted and stood
1611840	1617760	on its head, nevertheless the real content entered everywhere into the philosophy. All the more so
1617760	1625120	since Hegel, in contrast to his disciples, did not parade ignorance but was one of the finest
1625120	1630000	intellects of all time. He was the first who attempted to show a development and inner coherence
1630000	1636080	in history, so this historicism is very important. And while today, much in his philosophy of history
1636080	1641680	may seem peculiar to us, yet the grandeur of his fundamental outlook is admirable even today,
1642560	1648000	whether one makes comparison with his predecessors or to be sure with anyone who, since his time,
1648000	1653840	is indulged in general reflections concerning history. Everywhere in his phenomenology,
1653840	1658960	aesthetics, history of philosophy, this magnificent conception of history prevails,
1659040	1664320	and everywhere the material is treated historically in a definite, even if abstractly
1664320	1667760	distorted, interconnection with history. So when I've said before, by the way, that critical
1667760	1673200	theories only kind of concentrate themselves, you see this happening here. Engels is talking about
1673200	1678080	needing, by commenting on Marx, is saying that what we need to do is take Hegel and concentrate
1678080	1682480	him even further through critique. The critical theory that's emerging will eventually be named
1682480	1687200	critical theory several decades later, almost a century later, but not quite,
1688880	1692480	it needs to be concentrated through more and more critique. The dialectic has to be applied
1692480	1698160	to the dialectic, in a sense. So Engels wraps up by writing this epic-making conception of
1698160	1703440	history. He's very taken with the historicism of Hegel, which of course is central to Marx's
1703440	1709360	philosophy as well. And to Marxism, this epic-making conception of history was the direct theoretical
1709440	1714000	premise for the new materialist outlook, so dialectical materialism that Marx was forwarding.
1714000	1720960	And this alone, I guess this provides a typo, this alone provides a connecting point for the
1720960	1728000	logical method too. Since this forgotten dialectics has led to such results, even from the standpoint
1728000	1732640	of pure thinking and had in addition so easily settled accounts with all preceding logic and
1732640	1737760	metaphysics, there must be at any rate, there must at any rate have been more to it than sophistry
1737760	1742000	and hair splitting, which of course Schopenhauer would have viciously criticized it as just a
1742000	1748000	bunch of sophistry, because it is. But the criticism of his method Engel finally writes,
1748000	1754000	with all of its official philosophy, had thought shy of and still does, was no trifle.
1755440	1759680	He's a big fan of the historicism. He thinks that Hegel brought forth very important ideas.
1760400	1764720	The dialectic is a very important one, but it wasn't correct in its formulation. He says
1764720	1768160	something about if it's standing on its head, it's going to have to be righted. Of course,
1770080	1775280	that's exactly what Marx had written. Marx later wrote, in fact, as this is still quoting from
1775280	1780720	marxist.org, in his preface to the second edition of Capital Volume 1, Marx writes,
1780720	1787760	my dialectic method is not only different from the Hegelian, but is its direct opposite. So abstract
1787760	1796640	meets negative. Right. To Hegel, the life process of the human brain, i.e. the process of thinking,
1796640	1801600	which under the name of the idea, he even transforms into an independent subject,
1801600	1808400	is the demiurgeous of the real world. And the real world is only the external phenomenal form of the
1808400	1814640	idea. So just to summarize what that means, for Hegel, there's the idea, which is what's going
1814640	1819600	on for real, because he's an idealist, and then the world becomes an image of the idea.
1821120	1825600	And so Marx is like, that's upside down. What we have to actually look at is we have to look at
1825600	1831200	the real world and go from there. So he writes, with me, on the contrary, the ideal is nothing
1831200	1836640	else than the material world reflected by the human mind and translated into forms of thought.
1836640	1842720	Marx is probably right on this. The mystification which dialectic suffers in Hegel's hands by no
1842720	1848400	means prevents him from being the first to present its general form of working in a comprehensive
1848400	1853280	and conscious manner. With him, it is standing on its head. It must be turned right side up again
1853280	1858400	if you would discover the rational kernel within the mystical shell. And so the dialectic becomes
1858400	1863360	obviously central, but the Marxists are not happy. Marx and Engels, specifically not the Marxists,
1863360	1869200	are not happy with how it's been formulated. They say that by focusing on the ideal rather than
1869200	1874480	the material, they get it upside down. Of course, as I pointed out, we see the structure of Hegel's
1874480	1879040	dialectic being applied to Hegel's dialectic, where Hegel's dialectic is framed as the abstract,
1879040	1884480	just as Hegel did to Kant's formulation of the dialectic. And now it has to be made
1884480	1891920	more material. It's negation. It has to mean it's negative, which is where Marx says,
1891920	1898720	with me on the contrary, it's exactly the opposite. So we have abstract meaning negation,
1898720	1902960	and so the concrete that's going to come out of this is going to be dialectical materialism for
1902960	1911360	Marx. And so we see the dialectic turning on the dialectic and creating a new view that's supposed
1911360	1916240	to be the progression of history. And this is being reflected and it's being written and shared.
1916240	1924800	This is the entry for Hegel on today's marxist.org website. So jumping entries to give you more
1924800	1928160	insight, we got to understand the dialectic. That's the goal right now because I want you
1928160	1932480	to understand that the dialectic has been the operating system of the left. It has been central
1932480	1937040	to Engel, central to Marx, central to Hegel. Fauerbach was the one who tutored Marx and
1937040	1942320	made him materialist in the first place as a Young Hegelian. So we've got this Hegel to Young
1942320	1948480	Hegelian to Marx chain, where the dialectic is evolving through dialectical means. The operating
1948480	1954080	system is so central to the left's thought that the operating system of the left is operating on
1954080	1960400	itself to evolve itself. So we now have Hegel having applied the dialectic to Kant's dialectic,
1960400	1965760	and we have Marx and Engel's applying the dialectic to Hegel's dialectic to receive,
1967280	1971760	to get to dialectical materialism, which is the essence of Marxism. And so here we have,
1971760	1977920	as we read in the Critical Race Three book, and so the dialectic progresses. I told you there's a
1977920	1983040	very important little sentence that you wouldn't normally care about when you read that. So now
1983120	1988000	to go into the dialectic entry itself on Marxist.org, what did they write? They write,
1988000	1993200	it was Hegel who was able to sum up this picture of universal interconnection and mutability of
1993200	1998800	things in a system of logic, which is the foundation of what we today call dialectics.
1999600	2004640	As Engels put it, so they quote Engels here, quote, the whole world, natural historical
2004640	2010080	intellectual, is represented as a process, that is, as in constant motion change,
2010080	2014800	transformation, development. And the attempt is made to trace out the internal connection
2015360	2018960	that makes a continuous whole of all of this movement and development.
2021600	2028080	They go on to write, this is Marxist.org again, that's the end of how Engels put it. It was in the
2028080	2033440	decade after Hegel's death in the 1840s, when Hegel's popularity was at its peak in Germany,
2033440	2037520	then Marx and Engels met and worked out the foundations of their critique of bourgeois
2037520	2044400	society. Hegel's radical young followers, there's our young Hegelians, had in their hands a powerful
2044400	2050560	critical tool, the dialectic, with which they ruthlessly criticized Christianity, the dominant
2050560	2054240	doctrine of the day. This is, we'll see something that Hegel was actually interested in as well.
2054240	2061040	He wanted to reestablish a Fulcish German religion that escaped the Orientalism of Christianity,
2061040	2066880	which he felt had been foisted upon Germany, kind of inappropriately. Well, the young Hegelians
2066880	2071200	really felt this way, and they ruthlessly criticized Christianity using the dialectic.
2072160	2077920	So, to carry on, however, one of these young Hegelians, Ludwig Faurbach, pointed out that
2078480	2082560	the Holy Family was after all only a heavenly image of the earthly family,
2083520	2087200	and said that by criticizing theology with philosophy the young Hegelians were only doing
2087200	2092800	the same as the Christians. Hegel's absolute idea was just another name for God. For Faurbach,
2092800	2098080	ideas were a reflection of the material world, and he held it to be ridiculous that an idea could
2098080	2104640	determine the world. Faurbach had declared himself a materialist. Marx and Engels began as supporters
2104640	2110720	of Faurbach. However, very soon they took up an opposition to Faurbach to restore the Hegelian
2110720	2115760	dialectic which had been abandoned by Faurbach. Remember, this is Marxist.org summarizing the
2115760	2121280	history of the dialectic for us here, and to free it from the rigidity of the idealistic Hegelian
2121280	2126720	system in place to method on a materialist basis. So, you see, it is the dialectic being applied to
2126720	2135600	the dialectic itself. Kind of amazing. So, Hegel, they quote, was an idealist to him. The thoughts
2135600	2141920	within his brain were not the more or less abstract pictures of actual things and processes, but
2141920	2147440	conversely, the things in their evolution were only the realized pictures of the idea,
2148080	2153120	existing somewhere from eternity before the world was. This way of thinking turned everything
2153120	2156720	upside down and completely reversed the actual connection of things in the world.
2157680	2162480	Thus, for Marx and Engels, thoughts were not passive and independent reflections of the material
2162480	2167920	world, we're still reading from Marxist.org by the way, but products of human labor,
2167920	2172720	and the contradictory nature of our thoughts had their origin in the contradictions within human
2172720	2178560	society. This meant that dialectics was not something imposed on to the world from outside,
2178560	2182880	which could be discovered by the activity of pure reason, but was a product of human labor
2182880	2188080	changing the world. Its form was changed and developed by people, and could only be understood
2188080	2192560	by the practical struggle to overcome these contradictions, not just in thought, but in
2192560	2198960	practice. So, again, I make the claim, Hegel puts forth this dialectic, which he has
2198960	2208000	dialectically derived from Kant, and via the vehicle of the Young Hegelians, we now have
2208640	2214800	Marx and Engels trying to turn this materialist, and they actually are in fact dropping in a
2214800	2219760	dialectic on the dialectic again, and transforming it into something else. And the thing that comes
2219760	2226160	out of this is the dialectical materialism, which Marx said stands Hegel on his head. So,
2226160	2231040	I think we have now firmly established the line of the dialectic from Hegel to the Young
2231040	2236800	Hegelians to Marx and Marxism, and the Marxists themselves obviously still support this because
2236800	2242720	they write about this in this particular way on their website today. So, this I think line has
2242720	2249920	been that the operating system of the left up from Hegel to Marx is dialectic, and it in fact takes
2249920	2255440	the dialectic to concentrate the dialectic into a form that becomes Marxism, which is the dialectically
2255440	2260720	enhanced dialectic. So, the operating system is almost reflexive in the sense that it concentrates
2260720	2264960	itself, and this is where Marxism comes from. And again, it has to be stressed that the entire
2264960	2269760	operating system of the left from the 1840s and 50s, when Marx and Engels start writing this stuff
2269760	2275120	down, Marxism starts to become a thing, especially following the Russian Revolution in 1917, the
2275120	2282400	entire operating system of the left really becomes Marxist up through probably the 1960s,
2283280	2289120	when finally the failures of communism become undeniable, when finally Khrushchev comes out
2289120	2299520	and speaks and reveals as the premier of the Soviet Union how horrible Stalin's regime was,
2299520	2305280	how opposite to what people claimed it was, what Stalin claimed it was, what Walter Duranty at the
2305280	2309680	New York Times claimed it was, the propagandist at the Pulitzer Prize, kind of like Nikol Hanna
2309680	2316080	Jones today. So, I think we've established that far. Well, it turns out that this, even though we
2316080	2321280	have this kind of disillusionment with Marxism in the 1920s, we have this frustration among many
2321280	2326160	communists that the Russian Revolution worked, many Marxists, but no other revolutions are working,
2326160	2330560	the Hungarian Revolution failed, no other revolutions are sparking, Marx's prediction
2330560	2335360	that they would happen in big industrial centers like London and New York and Los Angeles and
2335360	2340720	Chicago and Berlin isn't coming to pass. It's only in BFE peasant Russia that it's happened.
2340720	2345600	It tried in Hungary, but Hungary couldn't do it. Something is wrong and the Neo-Marxists come up
2345600	2350480	with a new theory. Well, the Neo-Marxists are very interested in the dialectic and they in fact make
2350480	2354320	it central to the project. They name it all the time. They talk about all the time titles of their
2354320	2361120	books include, for example, the dialectic of enlightenment. Critical theory is in fact the
2361120	2366560	application of the precise dialectic that's now been dialectically moved again from where Marx was.
2366560	2372800	In fact, it's been said that the critical theorists turned, where Marx said that Hegel was standing
2372800	2377760	on his head, they put Hegel back up right because Marx is actually the one who turned him upside
2377760	2381760	down by making it too materialist and not realistic enough to help people actually operate.
2383040	2387920	They didn't take it back to the idea as Hegel did. They took it into the realm of culture.
2387920	2391680	That's why they're often called cultural Marxists, but it'd be more accurate, I think,
2391680	2399440	to call them cultural Hegelians. But at any rate, or dialectical culturalists or something,
2399440	2404880	cultural dialecticists or something like this. So they're not applying it in the Kantian sense
2404880	2410720	that's been dialecticized into the Hegelian sense. They're not applying it in the strict Hegelian
2410720	2417280	sense that's been dialecticized into dialectical materialism and Marxism, and they no longer
2417280	2420960	believe in that. And so they're now criticizing that. They're bringing the critique to Marxism
2421520	2426160	itself, and they're putting it into the realm of culture. And by doing so, they're now doing it in
2426160	2431520	this new way where the dialectic has applied to the dialectic repeatedly to come up with this new
2431520	2435760	thing. But they're also becoming much more politically activated, again, like the young
2435760	2441680	Hegelians were. And so they're kind of dipping back to when Marx was his most young Hegelian in his
2441680	2447120	very early writings. Some neo-Marxist critiques suggest that Marx lost his way while writing
2447120	2455280	Kapital. Communist Manifesto was better. But by the time he's getting in his early letters are best,
2455280	2460240	and when he started getting into writing things like Kapital, he was already kind of off his
2460240	2465760	rocker. He'd gone too far smelling his own farts, if you will, and they got it wrong. So they wanted
2465760	2469840	to put this Hegel back into Marx, but without making the same mistakes where Marx had already,
2469840	2474320	to them, rightly critiqued Hegel. So this was kind of one of their big projects. Of course,
2474320	2478240	they also wanted to work Freud in, also wanted to work social science in, and some other things.
2479280	2484400	But they also wanted to figure out how to attack culture, specifically having decided,
2484400	2492960	following people like Gramsci, following people like George Lucca, that culture somehow upholds
2494480	2500080	society and prevents these revolutions to the end of history, to the utopia, to communism, really.
2500640	2505040	And so it's a very politically activated sense for the Neo-Marxists in a very different way.
2505840	2510240	But again, we're seeing, my case that I'm trying to make is this is a fundamental operating system
2510240	2516880	of leftism. It's what's driving their vehicle. It's what makes their computer work, if you want to
2516880	2520800	stick with operating system metaphor, I guess. This is how the left thinks. It's how it moves.
2520800	2524560	It's how it achieves its goals. And so it must be understood if you want to understand what's
2524640	2530640	happening in the world today with this blossoming of absolutely insane woke leftism, which I'm
2530640	2535520	telling you is the last, the most recent manifestation, I should say, hopefully the last, but the most
2535520	2541120	recent manifestation of this crappy line of thought, this crappy religion, as it's come down for the
2541120	2546640	last 200 years, ultimately from the metaphysics of Hegel, which we'll get to a bit further down.
2546640	2552000	So to convince you just how central the dialectic is to the process of the Neo-Marxists and to show
2552000	2556400	you how they use it, I'm going to quote a number of examples from them. So Max Horkheimer,
2557360	2563840	the first chair of the Frankfurt School, the Institute for Social Research,
2565440	2569040	writes in traditional and critical theory where the idea of critical theory is defined for the
2569040	2574480	first time. He writes in the following pages, this is actually in a footnote, this activity,
2574480	2579200	which is what he's talking about in terms of his methodology, critical theory, the following pages,
2579280	2583200	this activity is called critical activity. This actually comes from Marx, by the way,
2583200	2587200	he didn't make up this term. You could go all the way back to the critique of pure reason or whatever
2587200	2592320	you want to do with Kant, whatever you want to say, but the point is actually that Marx had
2592320	2597040	developed something he called the critical philosophy and the critical activity comes out
2597040	2600720	of the critical philosophy and for Marx that meant the ruthless criticism of everything that exists,
2601840	2608160	largely in order to tear it down and make room for his own vision that he was imagining into the
2608160	2613040	world. So Horkheimer's written in the following pages, this activity is called critical activity,
2613040	2618720	the term is used here less in the sense it has in the idealist critique of pure reason, so not
2618720	2624480	Kant, than in the sense that it has in the dialectical critique of political economy, so Hegel.
2625120	2629840	In particular, though, political economy was that phrase we saw from Marx describing political
2629840	2634640	economy that Engels was commenting on when I read from earlier. So we're talking about Hegel
2634640	2640080	through Marx, it points to an essential aspect of the dialectical theory of society, Horkheimer
2640080	2649600	concludes. So Horkheimer, you know, first leader of the Frankfurt School, the Institute for Social
2649600	2654560	Research at Goethe University, that is really where critical theory comes from, it was developed,
2654560	2661920	this is the seat of neo-Marxism. This actually arose when he, Horkheimer, I mean, in conversation
2661920	2669120	with some others envisioned the idea of creating for the critical left a great analysis and eventually
2669120	2677680	book on the dialectic that would restore something of Hegel from Marx and Marx's failures were critical
2677680	2681840	to understanding the tasks, we had to criticize Marx, we have to do the dialectic to Marx's
2681840	2688880	dialectically derived dialectical materialism, which was derived from Hegel's dialectic at this
2688880	2695280	point. And so he produces eventually 1944-1947, this book that I mentioned a minute ago with Theodore
2695280	2700240	Adorno, another major neo-Marxist called The Dialectic of Enlightenment, which is considered to be the
2701040	2705520	real comprehensive treatment of critical theory, or in other words, the first real statement of
2705520	2710080	neo-Marxism and what neo-Marxism about, the whole book is titled The Dialectic of Enlightenment,
2710080	2714400	where they're trying to explain that the Enlightenment unleashes its own dialectic that turns
2714400	2721760	reason into unreason, it turns rationality into irrationality. So I'll read a little bit
2721760	2728160	around and from this book, in The Dialectic of Enlightenment, Horkheimer and Adorno make the
2728160	2733600	case in the words of one of its, the editor of one of its editions, a philosophical fragments
2733600	2738160	edition, which happens to be one that I have, the editor's name is Gunslyn Noor, if I'm pronouncing
2738160	2743440	that right, or it's an afterward where he describes what's going on with The Dialectic of Enlightenment,
2743440	2749040	and he writes, the self-destruction of Western reason is seen to be grounded in an historical
2749040	2755600	and fateful dialectic of the domination of external nature, internal nature, and society.
2755600	2760640	Enlightenment, which split these spheres apart, is traced back to its mythical roots.
2761280	2766720	Enlightenment and myth are not seen therefore as irreconcilable opposites, but as dialectically
2766720	2773840	mediated qualities of both real and intellectual life. As they write in the book, myth is already
2773840	2779680	Enlightenment and Enlightenment reverts to mythology. This paradox is the fundamental thesis
2779680	2787280	of the book, meaning dialectic of Enlightenment. Reason, Noor writes, reason appears as inextricably
2787280	2792640	entangled with domination. Since the beginnings of history, liberation from the compulsions of
2792640	2799600	external nature has been achieved only by introducing a power relationship of second degree.
2801920	2805920	Both the repression of the internal nature of human drives, that was very important to
2805920	2811840	Markuza in particular, and social domination are already at work in myth. Finally, fascism in the
2811840	2817760	modern culture industry are the forms taken by a return of repressed nature, so you can hear the
2817760	2822720	Freudian aspects being worked in as well. In the service of an advancing rationalization of
2822720	2828000	instrumental thought modeled on the domination of nature and serving its purposes, enlightened
2828000	2833200	reason is progressively hollowed out until it reverts to the new mythology of a resurrected
2833200	2839360	relationship to nature, to violence. This is what the dialectic of Enlightenment is arguing,
2839360	2843600	that's what the editor is writing here. This theme he writes is summed up in the opening
2843600	2848560	sentences of the book. Enlightenment understood in the widest sense as the advance of thought has
2848560	2853360	always aimed at liberating human beings from fear and installing them as masters, yet the whole
2853360	2860560	enlightened earth is radiant with triumphant calamity. So he's saying that the Enlightenment
2860560	2866640	has devolved into domination. Reason has become a tool of domination. You can see the precursors
2866640	2872160	that postmodernism is going to be thinking similar things already here in 44 and 47 from these guys
2872160	2881120	and these Neo-Marsists. I guess you could say that this book culminates very near the end
2881680	2887600	and kind of a cheerless proclamation is his statement of thesis really. In the progress of
2887600	2892480	industrial society, which is supposed to have conjured away the law of increasing misery,
2892480	2898080	it had itself brought into being the concept would justify the whole, the human being as a person,
2898080	2902800	as a bearer of reason is going under. The dialectic of Enlightenment is culminating
2902800	2909280	objectively in madness. So rationality becomes irrationality by the dialectic of Enlightenment.
2909280	2912800	And of course, that's where you're going to have a thesis meeting its antithesis,
2912800	2918000	rationality is becoming irrationality. And so a synthesis that escapes this is what's going to
2918000	2922400	be needed. And that's really what they're calling for in critical theory is framed as the tool to
2922400	2926720	do it. That's the purpose of this book, dialectic of Enlightenment. So the Neo-Marsists are completely
2926720	2934160	on board with the concept of dialectic. Again, the Neo-Marsists are going to become the things
2934160	2938080	that lead up to Herbert Marcuse. Herbert Marcuse is going to become the father of the new left,
2938080	2942960	which is supposed to take over where the old left, which is the Marxists left off. And we already
2942960	2948560	see this trajectory of relying still on that operating system of the dialectic. And so when
2948560	2953360	we turn to Marcuse, it's no surprise that we see him talking about the dialectic all the time.
2953360	2957840	When we read, for example, Herbert Marcuse in One Dimensional Man, which he wrote in 1964,
2957840	2964240	this being his most popular and famous book sold 300 plus thousand copies in the first year
2964240	2968880	from what I understand. So we're talking about an absolute intellectual rock star,
2968880	2973120	absolutely hugely influential. This laid the groundwork for the new, for the new left that
2973120	2979280	emerged during the Vietnam War into a new era and started with hippies and civil rights and
2979360	2983920	turned into eventually what we're dealing with today in the woke. And what Marcuse writes in
2983920	2990000	One Dimensional Man writing in 1964 is dialectical thought understands the critical tension between
2990000	2995680	is and ought, first as an ontological condition pertaining to the structure of being itself.
2995680	3001840	However, the recognition of this state of being, its theory, extends from the beginning a concrete
3001840	3006160	practice, intends from the beginning a concrete practice. So what he's saying is that we have
3006160	3012320	to understand through the analysis the critical tension between is and ought, between what is,
3012320	3017440	what the world actually is, and what it ought to be. That's that normative vision of a perfected
3017440	3023680	society. And this is something very important. Dialectical thought takes this as an ontological
3023680	3028560	condition that pertains to the structure of being itself. That's what he says. However,
3029280	3033520	he writes, the recognition of this state of being, its theory, intends from the beginning
3033520	3038800	a concrete practice. So you see this language of Hegel. We have the abstract meaning the negative,
3038800	3044640	and it's negative, and resulting in a concrete practice. In other words, activism that's going
3044640	3050720	to lead us to this new multi-dimensional, for him, two-dimensional analysis that's going to use
3050720	3056240	critical theory in particular to achieve what it's trying to do. It's going to have is and ought,
3056240	3063760	not just is as its analytical mode, two-dimensional, not one-dimensional. There's more to the
3063760	3069520	one-dimensional metaphor, but we'll leave it at that. So this dialectical thing is the essence
3069520	3077440	of critical theory. And so even from, we had up to Marx, no question, he called his project
3077440	3082560	the dialectical materialism, right? So up to Marx, there's no question that the dialectic of Hegel,
3082640	3086960	derived from Hegel, I should say, through the dialectical process itself, is the operating system
3086960	3091680	of the old left. Well, with Markuza, we have the birth of the new left, and that also is going to
3091680	3096560	rely upon this dialectic. He mentions the dialectic repeatedly in all of his works. So with Markuza
3096560	3101200	pushing it this way, it's no longer just going to be central to the old left and whatever remnant
3101200	3106240	goes forward out of the death of the falling of the various communist regimes, the horrors of
3106240	3111680	communism, crisis of faith and communism that arose from most, but not all Marxists at the time.
3111680	3115040	So not only the remnant of the old left and all of the old left leading back to
3116480	3122560	the old Marxists, but also to the new left that arose in its wake, largely starting in the years
3122560	3128320	leading up to and then launching off during the Vietnam War. So what does this look like in practice?
3128320	3133200	What does this dialectic of the new left look like in practice? So we turn back to Markuza.
3134160	3138000	You can look at this a couple of examples from Markuza's writing again in One-Dimensional Man.
3138000	3144720	He writes, the laws of thought are laws of reality or rather become the laws of reality
3144720	3149200	if thought understands the truth of immediate experience as the appearance of another truth,
3150080	3157280	which is that of the true forms of reality of the ideas. Thus there is contradiction rather
3157280	3162160	than correspondence between the dialectical thought and the given reality. The true judgment
3162160	3167600	judges this reality not on its own terms, but in terms which envision its subversion,
3167600	3173920	and in this subversion reality comes into its own truth. So Markuza is recommending a very subversive
3173920	3178880	approach and application. The dialectic becomes a subversive activity. It's something that we're
3178880	3183440	going to get in and we're going to get inside and do kind of undermining that which exists
3183440	3190480	by confronting that which is with its negations. And so thesis is going to meet antithesis in a
3190560	3196160	subversive way and it's going to force us to look for, probably force us to look for some
3196160	3200480	synthesis or at least to tear. Remember earlier when we read from the essay on liberation,
3200480	3205520	it's going to force us to start tearing away the constructs of current society so the seed of the
3205520	3210400	perfect society can blossom. This is Markusian thought at this point and it requires that
3210400	3215600	multi-dimensional or two-dimensional at least thought that he's speaking about in One-Dimensional
3215600	3222000	Man. So we can turn to more concrete examples of this in practice from Markuza because Markuza
3222000	3228320	is really paradigmatic of the post-war, post-war war two I should say, critical theory school that
3228320	3235040	inspired the black feminists who we'll talk about momentarily, kind of the second generation
3235040	3242160	critical theory that then becomes the roadmap to developing the woke that we live in today.
3242160	3245840	So in Repressive Tolerance, which I've read in full in another podcast,
3245840	3249920	four episodes, Herbert Markuza writes, according to a dialectical proposition,
3250560	3255440	it is the whole which determines the truth. So again, we're seeing this Hegelian idea that
3257120	3261200	the whole is you have to understand the whole to understand the particulars. This is a kind of
3261200	3268720	Hegelian metaphysical axiom and the dialectic is how you're going to approach doing this. Again,
3268720	3271840	we're talking about this being the operating system of leftism. So we're looking at new
3271920	3276240	leftism, its emergence from Markuza here in Repressive Tolerance. It says this is not in
3276240	3281040	the sense that the whole is prior or superior to its parts, but in the sense that its structure
3281040	3286080	and function determine every particular condition and relation. This is pure Hegelianism. You can't
3286080	3290480	understand the particulars without understanding the whole. So the whole is the thing you're trying to
3291040	3296400	extract from the particulars is the same idea of peeling away the problems of society so that the
3297360	3302800	the utopian society can emerge so that the seed of the perfect society can blossom, if you will,
3302800	3309040	or bloom. So he writes, thus within a repressive society, even progressive movements threaten
3309040	3315200	to turn into their opposite to the degree to which they accept the rules of the game. Generally,
3315200	3319760	the function and value of tolerance depend on the equality prevalent in the society in which
3319760	3325440	tolerance is practiced. Tolerance itself stands subject to overriding criteria. Its range and
3325520	3329440	its limits cannot be defined in terms of the respective society. So really what he's arguing
3329440	3333600	for in Repressive Tolerance is the dialectical treatment of tolerance, where tolerance is going
3333600	3340320	to be turned into intolerance. Tolerance is going to meet intolerance, thesis meets
3340320	3344800	antithesis into the synthesis is going to be a repressive tolerance or what he calls a discriminating
3344800	3350720	tolerance or a liberating tolerance. Tolerance is not actually tolerant at all, but that's going
3350720	3359440	to lead us toward a new and better liberated future. So thesis is tolerance, antithesis is
3359440	3365280	intolerance, synthesis is repressive tolerance, or this discriminating, liberating tolerance.
3365280	3372080	And so now tolerance gets the dialectic applied to it, and now you get this totally tilted playing
3372080	3377120	field that I said is the logic of the world we live in today, the logic of the left is repressive
3377200	3381680	tolerance, which ultimately its basic thesis is that conservatives must be censored. In fact,
3381680	3384880	they must be pre-censored. It's not enough that they lose their freedom of speech. They have to
3384880	3389920	lose the freedom to even think the thought by having their ideas pre-censored before they
3389920	3393200	can even enter their minds. So you're not talking just about the freedom of speech,
3393200	3397040	talking about cognitive liberty being put under threat by repressive tolerance.
3397040	3400960	And this is the product of, again, the point that I'm trying to make is that in the Neo-Marxist
3400960	3406560	era, we're here in the 1965 for this essay, in the Neo-Marxist era, we are now talking about
3406560	3410640	the dialectic being still central. It's still the operating system. We're doing the dialectic
3410640	3414880	on the dialectic. We're doing the dialectic on tolerance. We're doing the dialectic on other
3414880	3421120	ideas. We'll see in a second, democratic forms are going to be pulled into this. And so the
3421120	3425200	dialectic is still the operating system of everything that's going on through the left.
3425200	3430640	The old left had it. The new left is adopting it. So in his essay on liberation from 1969,
3430640	3435840	Marcuse writes dialectics of democracy. That's the heading, right? The dialectics of democracy.
3435840	3440720	This is how dialectics apply in democracy. If democracy, he writes, means self-government to
3440720	3445360	free people with justice for all, then the realization of democracy would presuppose
3445360	3450640	abolition of the existing pseudo-democracy. So we have thesis. We live in a democracy,
3450640	3457200	or we want democracy. Thesis. This is the democracy. Antithesis. It's a pseudo-democracy
3457200	3464560	because there are actually systems of power, right? There are systems of power with justice for
3464560	3469120	all. Well, not everybody's getting justice. So we don't live in a democracy, thesis. We live in a
3470080	3474480	pseudo-democracy, antithesis. So we're going to need a synthesis of this. And he writes,
3474480	3478640	in the dynamic of corporate capitalism, this is where he's describing the pseudo-democracy, I think,
3478640	3483920	the fight for democracy thus tends to assume anti-democratic forms and to the extent to which
3483920	3488240	the democratic decisions are made in parliaments on all levels, the opposition will tend to become
3488240	3493280	extra-parliamentary. The movement to extend constitutionally professed rights and liberties
3493280	3498080	to the daily life of the oppressed minorities, even the movement to preserve existing rights
3498080	3503040	and liberties will become subversive to the degree to which it will meet the stiffening
3503040	3507840	resistance of the majority against an exaggerated interpretation and application of equality
3507840	3512160	and justice. This is very similar to what we're seeing today. This logic is playing out exactly
3512160	3518560	right now under these so-called equity and racial and other social justice movements.
3518560	3524720	So what do we have here? Democracy is the thesis. Thesis-democracy, antithesis. Pseudo-democracy,
3524720	3528640	because of systemic power dynamics, the synthesis is going to be what Marcuse
3528640	3534160	elsewhere calls ideal democracy. The communists also refer to ideal democracy. If you don't know,
3534160	3539920	the communists position themselves as ideal democracy because, for them, if everybody's
3539920	3543760	not perfectly equal, if everybody's not got exactly the same amount of money, everybody's
3543760	3547680	got not exactly the same amount of opportunity, exactly the same amount of access, you can have
3547680	3551200	true democracy because certain people aren't going to be able to speak up as much. They're not
3551200	3554400	going to be able to get to the polls as readily. They're not going to have the same ability
3555280	3560800	to participate or the same access. So it's not a true democracy until there's perfect equity.
3561840	3567520	And so you can actually see here how they subvert language, right? The word democracy
3567520	3571520	meets this argument that we're going to call its antithesis. We know it's really a pseudo
3571520	3575680	democracy because there's systemic power. And so we have the synthesis of an ideal democracy,
3575680	3579680	which has an adjective in front of it, but the adjective gets dropped so that when these people
3579680	3586080	speak of democracy, they later or tolerance, they will later mean not liberating or discriminating
3586080	3589920	tolerance necessarily, or sorry, not regular tolerance, but liberating or discriminating
3589920	3593360	tolerance. And you won't actually know which one for sure. And here we have the word democracy
3593360	3598400	being subverted into this ideal democracy, which presupposes that we're in a communist-like
3598400	3603600	situation before it counts. And this is how their language games are constructed.
3603600	3608480	If you want to understand why they have so much doublespeak, this is where it comes from.
3608480	3613600	But again, my point so far, I'm dropping a lot of extra nuggets, point so far is to convince
3613600	3620160	you, and I think I have done so, that indeed the neo-Marxists are certainly going to have been tied
3620160	3624800	up with this idea of the dialectic. And the dialectic is being applied to the dialectic again,
3624800	3631360	and it's kind of a reflexive pattern that concentrates it. And so through, we got Hegel now,
3631360	3636320	leading into the young Hegelians, and the young Hegelians leading into Marx, and the Marx leading
3636320	3641360	into the Marxists, and the Marxists leading into like including Lenin, and the Marxists leading
3641360	3645760	into the neo-Marxists. And the constant thread is still in this dialectical engine, which even
3645760	3652960	gets applied to itself to create its new iteration. So the overarching project, or the underlying
3652960	3659200	operating system of leftism for the past 200 years, I'm going to keep repeating it, has been
3659200	3664000	the dialectic. Now, I want to take a quick diversion into the postmodernists. I'm not going
3664000	3669200	to develop this very far. But I also have to touch on one neo-Marxist here, Theodor Adorno.
3669200	3673680	So as for the postmodernists, I'm Theodor Adorno, which you can read in his 1966 book called,
3673760	3679360	So again, now 1966, we're getting a lot later. Postmodernism is actually emerging in France
3679360	3686560	already at this point. In 1966, Adorno writes his book, Negative Dialectics. And in both of
3686560	3691040	these cases, postmodernism and in my reading of Negative Dialectics, it seems to be the case that
3691040	3697760	we have gone, these guys have actually gone post-Hegelian. The neo-Marxists, or sorry,
3697760	3700720	where the critical theorists are normally called neo-Marxists, the postmodernists are usually
3700720	3705120	described as post-Marxists. In other words, they've given up on Marxism. They retain much of the same
3705120	3708880	underlying ethos, but they don't believe that it works and they become kind of negative and
3708880	3713120	despairing and they create kind of an upside down world version of it that just kind of is
3713840	3719920	cynical and all of this. Well, it seems that with the publishing of Negative Dialectics,
3719920	3724800	which is extraordinarily critical of Hegel, it turns out the postmodernists were also quite
3724800	3728960	critical of Hegel. I think Foucault is critical of Hegel and certainly being much more Nietzschean
3728960	3734080	in his approach, but I think Derrida, if I'm not mistaken, although I'd have to look that up again,
3734080	3738880	is very critical of Hegel. We certainly see Liotard being critical of Hegel as well in
3738880	3745680	the postmodern condition. We see this kind of shift with some of these thinkers, postmodernists
3745680	3750400	in particular, but also Adorno and Negative Dialectics to a post-Hegelian structure. Now,
3750400	3755040	like I just said, to go post means to have retained the essential core of what's going on,
3755040	3759920	of the approach. While deciding that the specific projects that had been launched on that core
3759920	3766640	must have been being done terribly incorrectly and had failed, so you abandon the specifics while
3766640	3773280	retaining the essential core. So in this sense, both the later writings of Adorno getting into the
3773280	3778400	1960s and the postmodernists seem very much like they're anti-Hegel on a superficial writing,
3778400	3783280	but they're not really that. They're post-Hegelian. They're mostly despairing of the idea of the
3783280	3787440	synthetic project, but they're not despairing of the idea, if you read Negative Dialectic,
3787440	3793280	of the collision of thesis and antithesis. If you read the ideas like Derrida's deconstruction,
3793280	3797040	or even Foucault's ideas where you're going to expose the contradictions and the progress of
3797040	3803360	history, or the contradictions of progress, or the contradictions of the idea of calling
3803360	3809200	anything knowledge at all, these are still very thesis-antithesis-colliding projects. The thing
3809200	3815440	is, these guys aren't looking for a synthesis. They aren't trying to do a final third step. They've
3815440	3821600	become post-Hegelian in that they've adopted the dialectical core, but abandoned the idea that
3821600	3826320	a synthesis is necessary. Adorno expresses this in Negative Dialectics. Derrida does so through
3826320	3831520	deconstruction, and the idea is really to get to particulars, rather than to come up with some
3831520	3837120	new synthetic whole. So synthesis for post-Hegelian thought, that's postmodernism, and the later
3837120	3841440	Adorno in Negative Dialectic is really a fool's errand for them. They think that's what's gone
3841440	3846320	wrong. That's why this has produced terrible results. This is why the Marxist projects failed.
3846320	3850880	The idea of trying to create a synthesis out of the dialectical process is a failure. So
3850880	3854560	for Adorno, we have to have a negative dialectic for Derrida. We just need to deconstruct.
3855520	3859040	So for them, it's better to just take things apart and leave them apart at the level of
3859040	3863600	particulars. It's not a very good example, but an example I've tried to give for this
3863680	3867360	in the past is, you know, I can go into my living room. It turns out I have a
3868000	3874960	very nice round kitchen table, and it has kind of four legs, and I have a small coffee table.
3874960	3879520	The kitchen table is wood. The coffee table is metal, as it turns out, and it has three legs,
3879520	3885360	and it's kind of shaped somewhat triangularly, but curved, like curvy triangle. And then I have
3885360	3889600	like a kitchen island thing that's also wood, but it obviously you can't get under it. It doesn't
3889600	3895120	have legs at all. It's like a block and has wheels under it. And so you could easily consider
3895120	3899600	those flat surfaces on top of all of these, one being round, one being this weird triangle, one
3899600	3904480	being almost perfectly square. Two of these are wood, one of them is metal. There are three different
3904480	3908160	heights. They're very different things. You could say, oh, well, they're tables. You could even use
3908160	3912880	the couch as a table. You could set things on it. You could lay things out. And so the idea of table
3912880	3918800	can be attacked by this idea that, well, these two things are very different from one another,
3918800	3921680	but we call them both table, or these three things are very different from one another. We
3921680	3927680	call them table. And just leave it. We don't have to call them tables. Leave it at this dining table,
3927680	3931920	this coffee table, and this kitchen island. Leave them at particulars. That's sort of the idea.
3933120	3938240	So the general thrust here is that the dialectic is, the general thrust of the dialectic is still
3938240	3941920	running. We're still going to collide ideas against their opposites, their antithesis,
3941920	3948480	their contradictions. They're negatives, really, in the Hegelian frame, but we're not going to try
3948480	3953920	to put the broken pieces back together. That's gone. They're in the despair, the pessimism,
3953920	3962400	the cynicism of being post-Hegelian, post-Marxist, or post-modernist. Adorno thinks he has the ticket.
3962400	3965840	The post-modernists are a little bit more negative. That's a big difference between them,
3965840	3971120	but it's difficult to actually tell if you read all of negative dialectic. There's no clear example.
3971120	3976160	There are just lots of very abstruse examples. I've read criticisms of negative dialectics
3976240	3979520	that it's impossible to understand what the negative dialectics is doing without reading the
3979520	3983440	entire book and comprehending it, and then you just have this idea of what it's doing.
3983440	3986720	So you don't have any concrete structures. That table thing might be BS.
3988000	3991280	As far as Foucault goes, as long as we're talking about post-modernist, he gives his usual critiques
3991280	3997040	for what it's worth, that the Hegelian approach might be good or bad. The dialectic might be good
3997040	4002960	or bad. I picked this up in the Foucault reader, and I'm trying to, I don't recall, I didn't write
4002960	4007840	down which of his essays or books it comes out of, but the Hegelian dialectical approach might be
4007840	4011520	good or bad, but the underlying engine of his project is still going to be Hegelian in that
4011520	4017120	it's trying to reveal the internal contradictions and ideas like progress, categories, science,
4017120	4021520	truth, knowledge, and then just kind of leave it at that because for Foucault, the idea was to
4021520	4026800	break down restrictions so that he could so-called expand potentialities. We see the same language
4026800	4033520	in Markusa as well, the idea of expanding the potential range of being human into achieving
4033520	4038400	liberation. So these are pretty consistent themes. They're ultimately Hegelian. The post-modern
4038400	4042240	left is like this despairing, broken, let's not even try to do anything positive with it,
4043040	4049120	whereas all of the positive projects that came out of the dialectic are in the synthetic aspect,
4049120	4054480	thesis, synthesis, then building a synthesis, and the post-modernists and even this later negative
4054480	4058640	dialectic adorno are kind of abandoning that project at this point in the late 60s, whereas
4058640	4064000	Markusa is still pretty into it, right, and Markusa really became the defining feature of the new
4064000	4074800	left, which means that again, from young Hegelian into Marxist old left into Markusian new left,
4074800	4082560	all of the leftists are still operating very strongly in this particular frame, this Hegelian
4082560	4087040	dialectical frame. So the dialectic is the operating system of leftism for the past 200
4087040	4091840	years. That's the point I really want to take home from this first half of what I'm talking about
4091840	4097440	with Hegel. I also have to make the case that this reliance on dialectic, and I'm telling you,
4097440	4101760	this is going to be long, there's a lot to this, this reliance on the dialectic appears in the
4101760	4108640	woke literature as well. So let's start with Patricia Hill Collins' landmark book in 1990,
4108640	4113840	Black Feminist Thought. We're going to see the dialectic invoked repeatedly. Remember also that
4113840	4119040	it appears in the Critical Race Theory book, right, and so the dialectic progresses. The bigger
4119040	4123280	thing gets resolved, so now we have to look at the smaller thing, so the dialectic progresses.
4123920	4129440	That's the theme there in the Critical Race Theory book. Well, here in 1990 in Black Feminist
4129440	4134000	Thought, which is a landmark book, it's not quite critical race theory, it's like the proto-critical
4134000	4139200	race theory. It is Black Feminism, and the link, by the way, to Black Feminism is that Herbert
4139200	4143200	Marcuse not only did he inspire much of the Black Liberationist movement to think in critical
4143200	4148000	theory ways, not only was his, or his ideas picked up by that, but they were particularly picked up
4148000	4153520	by the Black Feminists. The Black Feminists would have included as a thought leader Angela Davis,
4153520	4159600	who was the PhD student of Herbert Marcuse, and she was very, very influential in the development
4159680	4164560	of Black Feminist Thought, and Black Feminism comes into its fruit here. You can even find,
4164560	4169360	for example, Ibram Kendi praising Angela Davis explicitly in his bookstamps from the beginning,
4169360	4174240	which traces five thinkers, one of whom is Angela Davis, a very significant figure in the development
4174240	4184320	of woke thought. Here, right at the cusp of the birth of woke, 1990, in kind of the pinnacle book of
4184320	4189040	Black Feminist Thought, titled Black Feminist Thought, from Patricia Hill Collins,
4190640	4197360	gigantic figure in the field, we read, Black Feminism remains important because
4197360	4204000	U.S. Black women constitute an oppressed group. As a collectivity, U.S. Black women participate
4204000	4208960	in a dialectical relationship linking African American women's oppression and activism.
4208960	4213520	So oppression and activism have to be related dialectically. Dialectical relationships of
4213520	4219200	this sort mean that two parties are opposed and opposite. As long as Black women's subordination
4219200	4225760	within intersecting oppressions of race, class, gender, sexuality, and nation persists, Black
4225760	4231200	Feminism as an activist response to that oppression will remain needed. In similar fashion, the
4231200	4236320	overarching purpose of U.S. Black Feminist Thought is also to resist oppression, both its practices
4236320	4241280	and the ideas that justify it. If intersecting oppressions did not exist, Black Feminist Thought
4241280	4247600	and similar oppositional knowledges would be unnecessary. As a critical social theory,
4247600	4252560	Black Feminist Thought aims to empower African American women within the context of social
4252560	4259600	injustice sustained by intersecting oppressions. Since Black women cannot be fully empowered
4259600	4264640	unless intersecting oppressions themselves are eliminated, Black Feminist Thought supports
4264640	4270880	broad principles of social justice that transcend U.S. Black women's particular needs. Dialectical
4270880	4278240	relationships, dialectical thinking. Already present here, very core to understanding how
4278240	4285840	Black women as a collectivity, as a political group, are related to all the other axes of
4285840	4290080	oppression and how they're to understand their own oppression and how these oppressions bang up
4290080	4295200	against each other and compete against one another and clamor for attention. And the goal,
4296160	4301360	as we haven't talked about yet, but from Markuza, is to create solidarity. And that solidarity,
4301360	4305200	as we'll talk about a little bit more later, is to be affected through intersectionality. By the way,
4305200	4309520	the title of Patricia Hill Collins' next big book after Black Feminist Thought in 1990 was
4310160	4315760	Intersectionality. 1993, if I'm not mistaken, though I don't have it in front of me. So what
4315760	4320240	else does she write in Black Feminist Thought? This dialectic of oppression and activism,
4320240	4324800	the tension between the suppression of African American women's ideas and our intellectual
4324800	4329840	activism in the face of that suppression, constitutes the politics of US Black feminist
4329840	4335200	thought. The dialectics of oppression and activism constitutes the politics of US Black feminist
4335200	4340800	thought. More important, understanding this dialectical relationship is critical in assessing
4340800	4345280	how US Black feminist thought, its core themes, epistemological significance, and connections
4345280	4350240	to domestic and transnational Black feminist practice is fundamentally embedded in a political
4350320	4360240	context that has challenged its very right to exist. So dialectic, it is the politics. The
4360240	4364240	dialectic of oppression and activism constitutes the politics of US Black feminist thought.
4365040	4369040	I'm telling you, it's the operating system upon which all of this stuff is based. The critical
4369040	4374320	race theory comes out of Black feminism. Hello. Okay, so what else does she write in Black Feminist
4374320	4378880	Thought? I have several quotes from this. Historically, while they often disagreed on its
4378880	4383920	expression, some US Black women were profoundly reformist, while more radical thinkers bordered
4383920	4388400	on the revolutionary. African American women intellectuals, who were nurtured in social
4388400	4392880	conditions of racial segregation, strove to develop Black feminist thought as critical social
4392880	4397280	theory. Regardless of, remember that's critical theory, right? That's critical theory, which is
4397280	4401440	based in the dialectic, because we just heard that from Horkheimer just a minute ago. Regardless
4401440	4406400	of social class and other differences among US Black women, all were in some way affected by
4406400	4411040	intersecting oppressions of race, gender, and class. The economic, political, and ideological
4411040	4414720	dimensions of US Black women's oppression suppressed the intellectual production of
4414720	4420000	individual Black feminist thinkers. At the same time, these same social conditions simultaneously
4420000	4425520	stimulated distinctive patterns of US Black women's activism that also influenced and was influenced
4425520	4431920	by individual Black women thinkers. Thus, the dialectic of oppression and activism characterizing
4431920	4438240	US Black women's experience with intersecting oppressions also influenced the ideas and actions
4438240	4444880	of Black women intellectuals. Dialectic, dialectic, dialectic. We're drawing a straight line now
4446000	4451280	that is the twist. That's why I shouldn't call it a straight line. It's like a twisting line,
4452080	4458800	twisting and concentrating line, from Hegel straight to Patricia Hill Collins, Black feminist
4458800	4462560	thought. The reason that that line is twisting and concentrating is because the dialectic is
4462560	4468960	being applied to the dialectical process as it goes. She writes again, as long as social justice
4468960	4473920	remains elusive for African American women, it is likely to evade US society overall. This is
4473920	4477920	always just asserted, by the way. They just say that if Black women don't have all of whatever
4477920	4482800	they want, then US society doesn't have it either. That's just an assertion that's core to critical
4482800	4487520	race theory. In this case, Black feminism, from which critical race theory sprung. What do you
4487520	4492960	think Kimberly Crenshaw was? Black feminist. Therefore, Collins writes, the need for Black
4492960	4498240	women's activism is most likely will persist. But while the dialectical relationship linking
4498240	4503600	oppression and activism remains, that's theory and practice, or in other words, praxis as its
4504640	4509440	synthesis, the changing organization of intersecting oppressions as well as the contours of activism
4509440	4516320	required for resistance demand a dynamic Black women's activism and an equally vigorous US Black
4516320	4519600	feminism. So theory and practice both have to be put into play. We're going to see that theory
4519600	4524480	and practical are very central to the way that Hegel thought about these things as well, and
4524480	4529600	dialectic had applied to it. And of course, Marx derived the idea of praxis, which is theory put
4529600	4536960	into practice from these same ideas. So the lines are very straight here. So one more from
4536960	4542800	Patricia Hill Collins. Thus far this volume, this is near the end of the book, has synthesized two
4542800	4547440	main approaches to power. One way of approaching power concerns the dialectical relationship
4547440	4552720	linking oppression and activism, where groups with greater power oppress those with lesser amounts.
4552720	4561440	Rather than seeing social change or lack of it as preordained and outside the realm of human
4561440	4566560	action, the notion of a dialectical relationship suggests that change results from human agency.
4566560	4570720	Because African American women remain relegated to the bottom of the social hierarchy from one
4570720	4576000	generation to the next, again just asserted, US Black women have a vested interest in opposing
4576000	4581520	oppression. This is not an intellectual issue for most African American women. It is a lived
4581520	4588880	reality, lived reality indeed. As long as Black women's oppression persists, so will the need for
4588880	4594400	Black women's activism. Moreover, dialectical analyses of power point out that when it comes to
4594400	4599040	social injustice, groups have competing interests that often generate conflict.
4600400	4610160	So Black feminism, one of the key intellectual roots of critical race theory, one of the key pillars
4611120	4619840	theories within critical social justice theory, dialectic. Its engine is dialectical. The dialectical
4619840	4628160	engine tracing all the way back to Hegel. This is again modified by Faurbach, modified by Marx,
4628160	4633360	modified by the Neo-Marx, just modified again by Marcuse, modified again into Black feminism
4633360	4638960	through dialectical processes at every single step. This is what we're seeing, the dialectical
4638960	4645920	engine, dialectical operating system of leftism, both old leftism, new leftism that's following
4646000	4654960	Marcuse and now woke leftism. So we can see the same reliance on dialectic in Bell Hooks' book.
4654960	4660960	Bell Hooks is a Black feminist as well. In 1984, she writes feminist theory from margin to center.
4660960	4665040	This is a very huge theme for them, margins to center. Kimberly Crenshaw's famous paper,
4665040	4670800	Mapping the Margins. What is Bell Hooks' right in 1984? Yet women need to know that ideas and
4670800	4680400	theories are important. And absolutely essential for envisioning and making a successful feminist
4680400	4686080	movement, one that will mobilize groups of people to transform this society. Ironically,
4686080	4690880	lack of knowledge about revolutionary politics leads women to see ideas and theories as unimportant.
4691440	4696960	In the chapter on dialectics and revolution, Grace Lee Boggs and James Boggs discuss the
4696960	4706400	importance of ideas to revolutionary activists. What do they write? Revolutionists seek to
4706400	4711040	change reality to make it better. Therefore, revolutionists not only need the revolutionary
4711040	4717920	philosophy of dialectics, they need a revolutionary ideology, a body of ideas, based on analyzing
4717920	4721520	the main contradictions of the particular society which they're trying to change,
4721520	4726160	projecting a vision of a higher form of reality in which this contradiction would be resolved
4726240	4731520	and relating this resolution to a social force or force is responsible for and capable of achieving
4731520	4736080	it. In other words, a critical theory that's like the definition of a critical theory right there.
4736080	4740960	How does it operate through a revolutionary philosophy of dialectics? So this is quoted
4740960	4745200	in Bell Hooks' book as support for the case that she's making that black feminists,
4745200	4749840	in particular, and feminists more in general, need to be thinking in terms of philosophies
4749840	4753040	and ideas if they're going to have a successful movement. They can't be anti-intellectuals,
4753040	4761440	she's writing. So the bogs go on as quoted in Bell Hooks. It is only after you have arrived at the
4761440	4766000	correct ideology that it makes sense to develop your revolutionary politics, i.e. the programs
4766000	4771040	necessary to mobilizing and organizing the revolutionary social forces. If your ideology
4771040	4776560	is wrong, that is misdirected or limited, then all of the most brilliant programs for militant
4776560	4781440	activity must be absolutely clear about this sequence from revolutionary philosophy to
4781520	4788400	revolutionary ideology to revolutionary politics. The dialectic is at the heart of this.
4789680	4795520	Bell Hooks, extremely influential, writing in 1984 about the centrality of the dialectic.
4795520	4803200	What he's described here is literally, literally the Hegelian dialectic, right? Did you catch it,
4803200	4808480	right? Read that sentence again. They need a revolutionary ideology that is a body of ideas
4808480	4812400	based on analyzing the main contradictions of the particular society. We're going to see that's
4812400	4817600	related to the Geist, which they are trying to change, projecting a vision of a higher form of
4817600	4824400	reality. So there's your ideas, the idealism, in which this contradiction would be resolved
4824400	4830000	and relating this resolution to a social force or forces responsible for and capable of achieving it.
4830000	4834400	As we'll see, Hegel is a great big statist. So we're going to see this kind of trinity
4834400	4841360	of the kind of the culture or the spirit of society giving rise to the idea and the relationship to
4841360	4845200	the ideas of society and the ideas and the relationship to the state and the state in its
4845200	4851680	relationship to, again, that spirit of society. There's a very Hegelian sentence that is Hegel.
4851680	4858800	That is Hegel quoted from two bogs in Bell Hooks's book in 1984. Bell Hooks being absolutely
4858800	4864160	instrumental to the rising of somewhat of critical history, but actually of inserting critical
4864160	4869680	race theory in Black feminist thought, which we just discussed from Collins, directly into
4869680	4876240	critical pedagogy into education after her book in 1994, Book Teaching to Transgress. So again,
4876240	4881920	the operating system is the dialectic and the dialectic derives from Hegel as concentrated by
4881920	4887840	Fauerbach Marx, various neo-Marxists, Marcuse, the Black feminists. And here we see it arising
4887920	4895840	quoted in his almost original form, frankly, in a call for revolutionary politics. It requires
4895840	4904000	a revolutionary dialectic and a perfect ideology in Bell Hooks, 1984. Just to give you another,
4904000	4906720	I mean, I've got several more examples we're going to read through. I'm sorry, I need you to
4906720	4909840	understand that this is really what's happening in the world today. If you want to understand the
4909840	4914720	woke, you have to understand the dialectic. Kimberly Crenshaw, the creator of intersectionality,
4914720	4918000	one of the founders of critical race theory, actually the person who named critical race theory
4918800	4923280	also thinks dialectically. This becomes very obvious in her chapter that's titled Unmasking,
4923280	4927280	Color Blindness in the Law, Lessons from the Formation of Critical Race Theory, that
4927920	4934000	is the third chapter in a volume that she edited in 2019, titled Seeing Race Again. What a wonderful
4934000	4938880	concept she's driving here, becoming racists. But Seeing Race Again is the title of the book,
4938880	4944640	2019 book. So she wrote this essay as a chapter for the book. And she writes in there, this essay
4944640	4949520	this is the beginning of the essay, revisits the history of how critical race theory, CRT,
4949520	4954160	emerged as an intellectual response to color blindness and the context of institutional
4954160	4959120	struggles over the scope of equality and the content of legal education. It exemplifies how
4959120	4963600	in the aftermath of a groundbreaking challenge to the social order, institutional actors from
4963600	4968880	across the political spectrum embraced a gradualist strategy of integration, premised on the assumption
4968880	4975200	that the colorblind meritocracy stood outside of the economic and racial power. The emergence and
4975200	4980480	continuing significance of CRT in relation to colorblind ideology is a reflection of the cross
4980480	4985520	institutional traveling of resistance, the conditions of possibility that seed insurgent
4985520	4992240	knowledge and the continuity of these dialectics in the contemporary era. So she's thinking
4992240	4996880	dialectically. So I don't want to keep belaboring this point, but since I mentioned with Bellhooks
4996880	5001360	especially, and it's so important with an education, that the idea of teaching this
5001360	5006080	dialect so we have this engine of the left, I've got it up through critical race theory and black
5006080	5010160	feminism now all the way back to Hegel through Marx, Faurbach, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera,
5010160	5016560	Alonio Marxist, Mercuzza, we see Adorno defect from it after he writes the dialectic of enlightenment
5016560	5021840	with Horkheimer. And then all the way with a straight line, Hegel to the young Hegelians,
5021840	5027840	those are first progressive in this line of thought becoming Marxist. So then the old left
5027840	5033680	arises out of that. The old left gives way to the new left. The new left is the neo Marxist
5033680	5039280	left under Mercuzza. And this new left is dialectically driven. And this new left gives rise
5039280	5042800	to the black feminism movement and these other radicalist movements that we're seeing now.
5042800	5047360	And they are dialectically driven all the way up to a book in 2019 where Kimberly Crenshaw,
5047360	5053440	the founder of critical race theory is saying that the dialectics is crucial to what she's
5053440	5058240	saying. And along the way we have Bell Hooks who inspired Kimberly Crenshaw, for example,
5058240	5063840	writing and quoting somebody who basically lays out the exact Hegelian vision in the modern day.
5063840	5068320	So this is all extremely important. We now have that this is the underlying operating system of
5068320	5074400	the left, I think is a continuous old left, new left, or young Hegelian really, to old left,
5074400	5080640	which is Marxism to new left, which is neo Marxism to woke left continuity. But it's also
5080640	5086240	crucial in education. This is how they teach it. This is what their goal is to teach children to
5086240	5090400	think dialectically because that's the engine of their worldview. That's how they think about the
5090400	5095040	world. So it is the heart of the critical pedagogy project, which is the critical theory applied
5095040	5099600	to both the theory of education and the contents of education. So the dominant mode of education
5099600	5105120	in the West today seeks to teach our children the Hegelian dialectical mode, because that's the
5105120	5110800	underlying operating system of how leftism operates in our society. And they have totally
5110800	5115760	dominated the institution of education, following Gramsci's indication that education is one of
5115760	5120400	the five pillars of culture that must be infiltrated and overturned from within. So here,
5120400	5124800	reading from Isaac Gottzman's The Critical Turn in Education, which was a book from 2015,
5125440	5130080	we talked about probably the most influential critical pedagogist, his name is Henry Giroux.
5130080	5135360	He writes, students argued Giroux, this is quoting Giroux, need to learn how to be able to move
5135360	5140480	outside of their own frame of reference so that they can question the legitimacy of a given fact,
5140480	5147040	concept, or issue. He wrote that in 1978. Now to Gottzman. Furthermore, he contended marshaling
5147040	5152640	the support of Marxist literary theorist Frederick Jamison. Students quote, this is quoting Giroux,
5152640	5157120	have to learn how to perceive the very essence of what they're examining by placing it critically
5157120	5161120	within a system of relationships that give it meaning. In other words, students must be taught
5161120	5168560	to think dialectically, rather than in an isolated and compartmentalized fashion. For Giroux,
5168560	5173280	it was important that contextualization of information be embedded in a pedagogy that
5173280	5180240	takes seriously the social relationships of the classroom. This goes way back in education, however.
5181200	5186640	You can read from John Dewey, who's a very progressive education reformer, very influential
5186640	5190880	in our current education system. He was in the late 19th century when he wrote in, again,
5190880	5195840	perfect Hegelian fashion, quote, the state is then the completed objective spirit. That's like
5195840	5202560	Brian Strait Hegel, the externalized reason of man. It reconciles the principle of law and liberty,
5202560	5207520	not by bringing some truce or external harmony between them, but by making the law, the whole
5207600	5212560	of the prevailing interest and controlling motive of the individual. We haven't really touched on
5212560	5215760	Hegel's statism yet, but that's going to be relevant. I just wanted to drop that in there,
5215760	5221200	because it's tied into critical education. Even going back more than 100 years,
5221200	5227520	so this is being written just before 1900, we have this idea that the Hegelian view of the state,
5229280	5234960	the completed objective spirit that's so freaking Hegelian, is Hegel's metaphysics.
5235360	5239440	The way that you get at that completed objective spirit, the externalized reason
5239440	5245040	of man is through the dialectic. We have the whole dialectical project here. There's a link,
5245040	5249200	by the way, not just, I mentioned Bill Hooks inserting critical race theory into critical
5249200	5254160	pedagogy. Critical pedagogy is rising up. There's another guy before who is very important,
5254160	5257840	but less influential than Jiru, before him named Michael Apple. Michael Apple, repeatedly,
5257840	5261600	if you read Gatzman, you'll find out that he repeatedly talks about the need for dialectic
5261600	5268160	and education. But then later, even today, even very recently, we can see the insertion of this
5268160	5271920	kind of dialectical line of thought, but important in Neomarxism, which we now know is based on the
5271920	5277840	dialectical thought into education. So we read from an Allison Bailey's paper, Tracking Privilege
5277840	5281840	Preserving Epistemic Pushback, which appeared in the classrooms or something, the exact title.
5283120	5287600	It was published in Hypatia in 2017, Hypatia being the leading feminist philosophy journal that
5287600	5294560	very much so dips into critical pedagogy. It was the target of two of our fake papers,
5294560	5299440	one of which was a critical pedagogy paper. But this brings very to the front that critical
5299440	5305280	pedagogy is based very deeply, also not just in Jiru's belief that the dialectic should be
5305280	5310400	brought into the classroom, but also that Neomarxism itself should be brought into the classroom.
5310400	5314960	What does she write in 2017, Allison Bailey? Quote, the critical thinking tradition is concerned
5314960	5318640	primarily with epistemic adequacy, which is a fancy way of saying knowing what you're talking
5318640	5323280	about. To be critical is to show good judgment and recognizing when arguments are faulty,
5323280	5327760	assertions lack evidence, truth claims appeal to unreliable sources or concepts are sloppily
5327760	5333280	crafted and applied. That's true. For critical thinkers, the problem is that people fail to
5333280	5338000	examine the assumptions, commitments, and logic of daily life. The basic problem is irrational,
5338000	5343520	illogical, and unexamined living. End quote. Well, if you read Markuza, you know what she's talking
5343600	5347520	about. She doesn't cite Markuza. She's not quoting Markuza there. But you're not living that unless
5347520	5351280	you're a critical theorist, according to Markuza. So unless you're approaching the world from critical
5351280	5356320	theory, you're stuck in irrational, illogical, unexamined living that fails to examine the
5356320	5360240	assumptions, commitments, and logic of daily life. You're caught up in his so-called heteronymous
5360240	5365120	interests that I've mentioned in many podcasts so far. Okay, so here's she's framing out that
5365120	5369120	critical thinking isn't really critical thinking, which is exactly what Markuza does in Neomarxism.
5370080	5376000	In this tradition, Bayley continues, sloppy claims can be identified and fixed by learning to apply
5376000	5382880	the tools of formal and informal logic correctly. Critical pedagogy begins from a different set
5382880	5388240	of assumptions rooted in the Neomarxian literature on critical theory, commonly associated with the
5388240	5393360	Frankfurt School. Not really hedging anything there, is she? Here, the critical learner is someone
5393360	5398000	who is empowered and motivated to seek justice and emancipation. That's what Markuza says.
5398640	5403040	Critical pedagogy regards the claims that students make in response to social justice issues,
5403040	5407680	not as propositions to be assessed for their truth value, but expressions of power that
5407680	5413120	function to re-inscribe and perpetuate social inequalities. Its mission is to teach students
5413120	5418080	ways of identifying and mapping how power shapes our understandings of the world. This is the first
5418080	5423280	step in toward resisting and transforming social injustices, in other words, the dialectic, where
5423280	5429120	theory has to be whited to practice to generate praxis. By interrogating the politics of knowledge
5429120	5434000	production, Bayley writes, this tradition also calls into question the uses of the accepted
5434000	5439680	critical thinking toolkit to determine epistemic adequacy, to extend Audre Lorde's classic metaphor,
5439680	5445200	not that classic, it was written in 1984, but anyway, the tools of the critical thinking tradition,
5445200	5449600	for example, validity, soundness, conceptual clarity, cannot dismantle the master's house,
5449680	5454800	they can temporarily beat the master at his own game, but they can never bring about any
5454800	5460080	enduring structural change. They fail because the critical thinkers toolkit is commonly invoked
5460080	5465520	in particular settings at particular times to reassert power. Those adept with the tools
5465520	5470880	often use them to restore an order that assures their comfort. They can be habitually invoked
5470880	5476000	to defend our epistemic home terrains. So critical pedagogy for her for Alison Bailey
5476000	5480960	is based on neo-Marxism, she echoes Marcusa virtually perfectly, and she's talking about
5480960	5485760	teaching people to think in terms of ways that are going to be emancipatory and empowering
5485760	5490400	in perfect line with the dialectical process outlined by Marcusa. So in education,
5490400	5494960	we see this again and again and again and again now under critical pedagogy. So we're not just
5494960	5500320	satisfied that the leftism isn't just satisfied, I should say to use the dialectical method as
5500320	5504880	its operating system, it must install that operating system in children, which is why I've
5504880	5512240	said repeatedly that the woke don't use education to indoctrinate, they use education to program
5512240	5519200	and reprogram. They're not teaching you to accept a particular doctrine uncritically,
5519200	5522800	although that is happening as well. They're teaching you to think in a particular way,
5522800	5530560	and that way is dialectically. Again, we heard that explicitly, not metaphorically, not anything
5530560	5537120	explicitly from Henry Giroux, considered the father of critical pedagogy, what he said is,
5537120	5543520	in other words, students must be taught to think dialectically. So that is the object here, that
5543520	5548960	is what's going on, and I could go on with this at length. Over and over and over again, quoting
5548960	5554560	from luminaries across this dialectical left, if you will, the inheritors of young Hegelian thought,
5554560	5558640	including Marx down through the neo-Marxist through the leading lights of critical race theory and
5558640	5562800	every other critical social justice theory today, and I could quote from them again and again and
5562800	5568880	again showing explicitly, not hedging a single word, that the dialectical mode of thought is how
5568880	5573280	they think about everything. It is their underlying operating system, it is the heart of their
5573280	5582320	interrelated worldviews, and it comes from Hegel, the first to consciously apply it in the words
5582320	5590480	of the Marxists on marxist.org. So a couple more quick points that finalize my case on this,
5590480	5594320	and then I'll move on to the metaphysical part, which is the second more difficult case to make.
5594960	5600000	I think I've really hammered this one in. First, recall that we began by reading
5601360	5604000	from the book, Critical Race Theory and Introduction, which ended with, and so the
5604000	5607520	dialectic progresses. I want to draw your attention back to that. So if you recall,
5607520	5613360	that little piece was framed out in terms of the so-called essentialism versus anti-essentialism
5613360	5617280	philosophical program, and I brought that up. I mentioned that that was important,
5617920	5625360	and it's the way the section in which that phrase appears is in a section in the book,
5625920	5631360	or is a section in the book, where it's analyzing how critical race theory interacts with the ideas
5631360	5635760	of essentialism versus anti-essentialism. But these two, essentialism and anti-essentialism,
5635760	5643520	are clearly thesis antithesis. It's thesis antithetical in its construction, essentialism
5643520	5649680	versus its negation anti-essentialism. So what then is the woke synthesis? It's forwarded,
5649680	5654320	say, by critical race theory. It's in the critical race theory book, but also by the other theories
5654320	5658800	of critical social justice. The answer is structural determinism. This is a very important
5658800	5662640	concept. I've talked about it in some other podcasts. I'm not going to elaborate on it too
5662640	5667200	much here, but it is the structure of society. The hypothesis, structural determinism, is the
5668000	5672480	doctrine, really, that the structure of society determines something like an essential lived
5672480	5680640	experience. It's not essentialist because it nevertheless hides within a social constructivist
5680640	5686160	mode of thought. So race, under critical race theory, is a social construct. So race can't be
5686160	5692800	essential to the person. So it dodges essentialism. But they claim that race, and this is explicitly
5693440	5698960	articulated by Crenshaw and many others, that race is sociopolitically imposed by the white
5698960	5704320	and the allegedly white supremacist and racist society, so that the lived experience of being a
5704320	5712880	particular race in that system becomes essential. So race is not essential in the sense that they
5712960	5718160	are social constructivists, thus anti-essentialist, but the experience of being a race in a particular
5718160	5723600	power structure where that race is imposed by that power structure does define what it means
5723600	5727520	to be that kind of a person, of that identity category. We hear that again and again in Black
5727520	5731200	Feminist Thought. We just heard it from Patricia Collins over and over and over again about Black
5731200	5738560	women. So your lived experience becomes essential. So via the dialectic, critical race theory gets
5738560	5743760	to be race-essentialist while claiming it's race-anti-essentialist. And so it's really hard
5743760	5748160	to pin down whether or not it's race-essentialist or not, because it's taken essentialism and
5748160	5752320	anti-essentialism, collided them in the dialectic, and produced this new thing that's hard to fight
5752320	5757440	called structural determinism. And structural determinism is the logic behind how they organize
5757440	5762720	society. When they say things like, for example, that positionality must be consciously engaged
5762720	5766640	or intentionally engaged. That's a Robin D'Angelo. It appears all over the place in Robin D'Angelo's
5766640	5771840	writing. That's what she's talking about. Structural determinism has to be taken into account.
5771840	5775920	Structural determinism allows them to be essentialist while claiming anti-essentialism,
5775920	5779600	and it keeps people from being able to pin down what they're actually doing and why and how they're
5779600	5786960	actually racist. It's by claiming a imposed lived experience that people aren't allowed to buck.
5786960	5791840	So they had a dialectical synthesis of these two ideas. And that's what's going on when the
5791840	5797120	so the dialectic progresses into yet another deeper intersectional group in that book. That's
5797120	5801120	what's what's being talked about. And of course, again, I draw your attention to the word progress,
5801120	5806400	progresses. That's the idea behind Hegel's that dialectic is constantly progressing through an
5806400	5812880	arc of history. So this is still the operating system. And finally, on this part of the podcast,
5812880	5816720	anyway, we're going to keep going, I'll note that the entire concept I've kind of hinted at this
5816720	5821120	already of intersectionality as framed out by Kimberly Crenshaw is also just a huge dialectical
5821120	5827680	machine. I did a podcast series on Crenshaw's mapping the margins, her most famous paper.
5827680	5832160	So people who want to know more about how I identify the dialectic in intersectionality itself
5832160	5835200	can go listen to that and hear me develop the thought there. That's really where I developed
5835200	5839600	it the first time. But in its core essence, intersectionality turns critique inward
5840480	5847360	into itself really, it takes already so-called marginalized activist groups and dialectically
5847360	5852960	attacks them. They attack themselves with their own tool. Feminists have to confront their racism.
5852960	5856880	Black Liberations have to confront their sexism and misogyny. And also everybody's going to have
5856880	5862480	to confront their homophobia or whatever. The goal that is stated there is to create solidarity.
5862480	5867120	But if you read Markouza's essay on tolerance, section four, it's a four part essay, is just
5867120	5872560	solidarity. Solidarity is the objective that is said to create liberation. So this is all we're
5872640	5879520	seeing here is the same dialectical neo-Marxist engine. So solidarity becomes the dialectical
5879520	5884640	synthesis of these competing, remember where Patricia Collins was talking about the competing
5884640	5888880	forms of identity and their oppressions. Intersectionality becomes the synthesis
5889920	5893840	of these competing forms of oppression and the dialectic of oppression and activism that she
5893840	5901600	keeps talking about. Intersectionality becomes the synthesis there. Of course, Markouza also
5902240	5907200	says that we have to biologically change mankind to want and need liberation.
5907200	5911520	And that will actually be done by changing them biologically to want and need solidarity to
5911520	5916480	want another, to create a whole new kind of man, liberated man, kind of an echo of the new Soviet
5916480	5924560	man that will be able to tolerate and usher in liberation. But Markouza's eugenics is another
5924560	5930000	topic for another day. The point here though is the dialectical critique, really what we're going
5930000	5935760	to see is the Alphabander Coulter. At the heart of the leftist project, it's turned inward under
5935760	5940320	intersectionality directed from one identity political group to another to create solidarity
5940320	5945200	allegedly across all of the so-called marginalized identities by evoking their guilt
5945200	5948880	that they're oppressed and therefore that they're ignoring the oppressions of other people
5948880	5953040	and need to be more sensitive to that. And intersectionality therefore becomes the synthesis
5953040	5957280	of the various otherwise competing forms of systemic oppression. So if you see critical,
5957280	5963520	say race theory, queer theory, et cetera, as means to tear everything down intersectionality
5963520	5968400	becomes the means to synthesize and put them back together into a new cobble together upside down
5968400	5973200	pyramid hierarchy, which is exactly what people are perceiving. And that's where it lives. That's
5973200	5978960	why it is intersectionality is the dialectical synthesis of all of the competing forms of
5978960	5984800	so-called systemic oppression. And it gives an analytical framework allegedly for working that
5984800	5989920	out and establishing a hierarchy, which is the inversion of what Patricia Collins called
5989920	5994880	the matrix of domination that describes how intersectionality works. So it of course though
5994880	5999520	intersectionality has to be organized this way. Why? Because the dialectic is the operating system
5999520	6004880	of the left. It's driven by Alphaband just like we're about to turn to. It's been the core of
6004880	6011120	progressive, therefore dialectical thought and the dialectical progressive left's project for
6011120	6015920	almost 200 years. That's the point I wanted to drive home with this first half ever since Hegel
6015920	6022000	unleashed it and it's an applicable form into the world. So of course intersectionality would be
6022000	6029360	organized that way. So to summarize, the dialectic is the operating system of leftism and has been
6029360	6035920	since the young Hegelians took it up probably in the 1820s and 30s right up through today. So 200
6035920	6041760	years. Just incidentally, as an aside, the concept of manifest destiny, which is often charged by
6041760	6046960	the left as being this catastrophe that destroyed Native Americans and all these lands and blah,
6046960	6052400	turns out that that wasn't exactly a conservative meta-narrative. It was championed by the so-called
6052400	6057200	young Democrats. The young Democrats were the American parallel to the young Hegelians. They
6057200	6062720	had adopted a lot of the Hegelian progressive philosophy of the young Hegelians. These young
6062720	6067840	Democrats used these ideas, including manifest destiny in the United States of the 1830s and
6067840	6074480	1840s to what a lot of people see as calamity, but not necessarily. And I guess kind of as a final
6074480	6079760	capstone to that line, Stephen Douglas, who famously lost the debate in the election to Abraham Lincoln,
6079760	6085040	wasn't a vowed Hegelian in the young Hegelian mode as well. So just something to kind of contextualize
6085040	6089760	that period of history for you. This was happening in the United States, not just Europe in terms of
6089760	6098080	thought and activism. So I think I've established that the essential core of the operating system
6098080	6103520	of the left is the dialectic. This has been from Hegel and the young Hegelians all the way forward
6103520	6109600	through the Marxian old left, to the neo-Marxian new left, to the contemporary woke left. And this
6109600	6115440	is the engine that drives all of their thought and activism, the dialectic, which draws back to Hegel.
6116400	6121360	How does it work, though? The tool is called alphaben. It's a German word. It means to keep
6121360	6126960	and yet to destroy at the same time. It's a very complicated term. I've talked about alphaben a
6126960	6131280	little bit before. I'm going to develop alphaben here a little bit to give you an idea that Hegel
6131280	6135920	himself was fascinated by this idea of alphaben, keeping and destroying. He writes in his book,
6135920	6140720	The Science of Logic, or just Science of Logic, alphaben constitutes one of the most important
6140800	6145840	concepts in philosophy. Alphaben, he says, has a twofold meaning in the language. On the one hand,
6145840	6150800	it means to preserve, to maintain. And equally, it also means to cause disease, to put an end to.
6151760	6157520	It is a delight to speculative thought, defining the language words which have in themselves
6158320	6163760	a speculative meaning. This was Hegel talking about this fascination with the term alphaben.
6163840	6170720	Alphaben, I'm going to make the contention, is the negation process. It is the negative process.
6170720	6176160	When Hegel lays out abstract negative concrete, it is the negative process. Or in other words,
6176160	6181280	it could be the antithesis process. I gave this example in a recent video that I put out.
6181280	6188080	I derived this from a friend of mine on Twitter. Brilliant observation and frustration by my friend
6188080	6194160	Emmy, who pointed out that she said that this is basically what you see on Twitter, but it's
6194160	6198960	really more accurate to say is what you see from the dialectical aspects of Twitter. And this is a
6198960	6204400	perfect example of alphaben. It's that I might say that the sky is blue, and a straight negation of
6204400	6209440	that would say, no, it's not blue. Or maybe you would negate by implication by saying it's green,
6209440	6217440	or it's red, or it's some other color. But an alphaben would say not at night, or maybe even
6217520	6222560	not when it's raining. And so it has this feeling of deliberately missing the point. So you get to
6222560	6227360	keep the blue, like you didn't actually tear down the blue, you get to keep it. But at the same time,
6228880	6233680	you've abolished the concrete sense that the idea was right in the first place. So now you have to
6233680	6238880	reach this synthetic view of the sky that's more complicated, that the sky is only blue during
6238880	6243280	daylight hours in clear skies or something like this. This is a very good way to get a sense of
6243280	6247760	how this dialectic proceeds to this concept of alphaben and what alphaben actually looks like
6247760	6252880	in practice, according to the way that Hegel imagined it. This is this kind of very annoying
6252880	6259360	tool that the dialectic proceeds upon. By the way, since he uses the word speculative over and over
6259360	6263680	again, it's important to point out that Hegel was a speculative idealist as a type of philosopher.
6264240	6271040	Speculative means looking into a mirror, speculum is a mirror in Latin, and sort of what it means.
6272000	6275440	Hegel meant by being speculative or what he means as a speculative idealist is that
6275440	6280480	the way to understand ideas is to reflect upon them. The purpose of reflecting upon the ideas
6281120	6288080	is to recollect or remember what's already known in a very abstract sense. Really, it's also to
6288080	6294480	divine the concrete from facing the idea and its negation at the same time. So alphaben in that it
6294480	6300480	means keep and destroy at the same time is speculative in that it contains this place where
6300480	6307440	you have the thing in its opposite reflecting back on one another at the same time. So alphaben is,
6307440	6313360	in a sense, what is an autological word that is alphabening itself. I don't know my German conjugation,
6313360	6319360	so we're just going to use German-English for that and say alphabening, which is totally wrong.
6320880	6325120	And I don't care. Sorry, Germans. You guys can put it in the notes or whatever.
6325760	6331760	So this is going to be key to moving into the trajectory of Hegel's underlying metaphysics
6331760	6336000	that we'll get to in the next part of the podcast or the development of the podcast,
6336000	6340560	and that is that he has this metaphysical assumption that the particular can only be
6340560	6344320	understood through the whole, and speculation is going to be kind of how you're going to
6344320	6351360	accomplish that. And so the recovery of the whole through a speculative thought process of reflection
6351360	6357680	and recollection, remembering, is going to be able to be achieved through examining the particular
6357680	6363360	and their antithesis through the dialectic. And that is the ultimate objective for Hegel of philosophy,
6363360	6370480	a.k.a. reason or in German Vernunft. So this makes Hegel, we have to point this out because
6370480	6375600	we're going to come back to this a bunch of times later, Hermetic. And Hermetic means an alchemist.
6375600	6380960	And that's his philosophical orientation because his alchemy is achieved through the dialectic,
6380960	6388720	the dialectic is like the fire that heats the contents of ideas in its alembic and gives rise
6388720	6394960	to their refined or synthetic understanding. Alphabon is the process that's going on, is the
6394960	6400480	way in which ideas are to be refined alchemically, kept yet destroyed. That's where Markoons is
6400480	6407520	talking about peeling off the power of the current era so that the seed within can sprout.
6407520	6413680	That's a Hermetic idea. Hermeticists believe, for example, that the seeds of gold exist in
6413680	6419600	all the base metals. So if you can just get the base parts to peel away, then the seed of gold
6419600	6424240	will sprout and blossom and the base metal will be transformed into gold. That's a Hermetic or
6424240	6430320	an alchemical belief. This is actually the underlying idea of Hegelian thought. So when
6430320	6436240	we say that Hegelian thought is a Hermetic or alchemical faith, that's actually what I'm talking
6436240	6441440	about. And Alphabon is the tool, keep but destroy, by which it's done. And of course, it's itself
6441440	6447760	so-called speculative. So it's very important to realize that what, and we'll see this later on,
6448640	6453360	that what Hegel actually means by speculative is having mystical content. It's mystical. It's
6453360	6461120	mysticism. Speculative means mysticism. And so this is going to open the door to a lot of things
6461120	6466160	for Hegel that he already was, like Hermeticism, Alchemy, and in particular also Gnosticism,
6466160	6471040	which is why all of these ideologies, like critical race theory, can be thought of as race
6471040	6475040	Gnosticism, like people having a particular race because of their structurally determined lived
6475040	6480400	experience, have special insight under a doctrine of standpoint epistemology that gives them the
6480400	6485040	ability to understand things and have racial knowledge, etc. It gives them special knowledge.
6485040	6490560	That's Gnosticism. That's racial or ethnic Gnosticism. And this is why, because the Hegelian faith is
6490560	6496160	itself Gnostic, and it's open to being Gnostic because it's speculative, by which me is meant
6496160	6501760	mystical. And the people who know the secret are the Gnostics. The people who understand
6501760	6504960	the mysticism are the Gnostics, the ones that have the special knowledge. And that special
6504960	6509920	knowledge for Hegel is defined in what he calls reason, or for nooft. So we're going to see this
6509920	6514640	developed as we go on into his metaphysics. But I really just wanted to drop this here to
6514640	6519120	reinforce the idea that Hegel is already thinking just in his comment on what Alphabin means,
6519120	6523120	which is a very fascinating and important concept central to his dialectic. This reinforces the
6523120	6527600	idea that he's thinking metaphysically and he's thinking in terms of his metaphysics alchemically
6527600	6532800	or hermetically about the progression of society. This is to also say then that since he's thinking
6532800	6539200	mystically and Gnostic, he's thinking religiously. And the catechism of his religion is the dialectic,
6539200	6544400	which is driven by this odd concept of keeping and destroying called Alphabin in German.
6544880	6552000	So as a further aside, speculative, let me just kind of like dive into this a minute further,
6552880	6556800	also taps into two features that we see all the way through Hegelianism, Marxism,
6556800	6561360	Neo-Marxism, and Wokism, which is that words are always given more than one meaning. We've already
6561360	6568000	seen how that happens with say democracy and tolerance, for example, under Markusa. And the
6568000	6573920	dialectic is how that's achieved. So you're alchemically developing a second meaning to words
6573920	6578160	so that you can talk in two ways at once. The people who understand this fancy new language,
6578160	6583600	the so-called initiated priests, are the Gnostics. They understand something on a deeper way. They
6583600	6588640	understand in modern parlance under these ideas, the systemic way of thinking and understanding
6588640	6592880	the world while everybody else understands the words and the various ideas and what's going on
6592880	6600560	in another more simple way. And the other more simple way is not accessible to the Gnostic,
6601280	6605920	is not accessible to the Agnostics, the people who aren't given access to this way of thinking.
6605920	6611520	So alphabin becomes a kind of paradigm example, a word that means it's own opposite. But this
6611520	6616160	same kind of thought was taken up later by Marx under the words, for the term, for example,
6616160	6620320	science. We could do it with democracy and tolerance also as Markusa did, but democracy
6620320	6626560	certainly under Marxism. But Marx used science to mean scientific socialism very frequently.
6626560	6632800	He claimed that socialism itself is scientific. Wissenschaft liegt er sozialismus or something
6632800	6636160	like this in German. I'm going to mess that up every time I have to say it throughout this whole
6636160	6640480	thing. I think I got Wissenschaft liegt er, liqueur, right? But maybe not liqueur, liqueur,
6640480	6645520	I don't know German. So the Marxism and communism that he labeled as scientific and everything
6645520	6651760	else, pseudo-scientific, or really pseudo-scientific or scientific, but they actually present
6651840	6656800	themselves as being scientific. So you have this reversed meaning game played through the
6656800	6660560	dialectic. Communists do the same thing like we talked about before with ideas like freedom,
6660560	6666320	democracy, tolerance, which they insisted require communism as a precondition, something the Neo-Marxists
6666320	6671040	also argued in Markusa we saw, argued vigorously further in their day, and the Wokes still do now.
6672160	6677040	We also see this tendency for so-called speculative meanings that invite Nazism and
6677040	6680960	mysticism in their understanding all the way down to what everything going on in the Woke
6680960	6685600	in proliferation right now. I've documented some of these in tremendous detail on the
6685600	6692160	social justice encyclopedia I'm keeping on new discourses. You could talk about it within racism,
6692160	6697200	meaning two things. You could talk about it in diversity, inclusion, etc., segregation,
6697200	6703280	desegregation, all of these things. Decolonialization is actually colonizing the curriculum,
6703280	6708240	for example. These are all key examples of the Sophistic, like Sophistry,
6708240	6715520	double-speak characteristic of Hegelian ideologies, which these are actually just one
6715520	6723040	genus in the broader order of Sophistry and Gnostic abuses. It's a very big picture kind of thing
6723760	6727360	just to kind of drop that in there as an aside, but we can see the double-speak clearly under
6727440	6734640	Alfhaven. We can turn to Lenin, who was big on Alfhaven. He was talking about sublation
6734640	6739440	technically, which is a typical translation, maybe a vulgar translation of Alfhaven. He says,
6739440	6744080	it means to supersede, put an end to, but simultaneously maintain and preserve. You've
6744080	6748960	got this kind of double-speak there. Lenin's promoting this idea of Alfhaven. Markuza talks
6748960	6758400	about it in his essay on the affirmative character of culture, which he published in
6758400	6764000	Culture and Society in 1937. Herbert Markuza wrote, it is the real miracle of the affirmative culture.
6764000	6768000	People can feel happy even if they are not. That's one of his big themes that people are
6768000	6774960	actually miserable, but they think they're happy. I guess you can own nothing and be happy.
6775040	6779440	If the culture has entered a Western thought only as an affirmative culture, the abolition
6779440	6783120	of its affirmative character will act as an abolition of culture as such,
6783120	6789120	where the German he wrote for abolition of culture is Alfhaven der Kultur, where Alfhaven
6789120	6797600	is the noun version of Alfhaven. Alfhaven der Kultur, by the way, seeing it pop up here
6797600	6802240	from Markuza in 1937, Alfhaven der Kultur is a phrase that actually arose much earlier
6802800	6809280	with another communist thinker about two decades earlier, namely the enormously aggrieved
6809280	6813760	Georgie Lukacz, or I guess it's just Georgie Lukacz. He's not a girl. I'm trying to get that
6813760	6818880	right. We saw it as a necessary goal, Alfhaven der Kultur, the destruction of culture, the
6818880	6823120	abolishment of culture, saw it as a necessary goal to achieve the kind of revolution, meaning
6823120	6827680	a communist revolution that had just failed for him in Hungary. He saw that Western civilization
6827680	6832400	was the problem. We had to tear down Western culture to achieve the revolutions that he was
6832400	6840160	craving as a communist, and the pathway must be to destroy Western culture, Alfhaven der Kultur.
6840880	6845840	And he first discussed this idea in an essay from 1920, the first time that the phrase Alfhaven
6845840	6850880	der Kultur appears in the communist literature comes from 1920, and the essay's title is Who Will
6850880	6856160	Save Us from Western Civilization by George Lukacz. This line of thought then Alfhaven der
6856160	6862560	Kultur becomes kind of a genesis point where I've talked before where Lukacz and Antonio Gramsci
6862560	6867840	and Max Horkheimer, for example, met in Vienna. I think that was in 1923. So just after this,
6867840	6871360	this is obviously how they're thinking to destroy the culture. And then we have the
6871360	6876240	Frankfurt School coming out of this between Lukacz and Horkheimer going back to Frankfurt.
6876240	6879680	And we have Gramsci going to prison a few years later and writing the prison notebooks, which
6879680	6885600	become the basis of cultural Marxism that are literally to infiltrate the cultural hegemonic
6885600	6890160	sphere by entering the pillars of culture and abolishing them from within by establishing
6890160	6895440	a counter hegemony, counter hegemony or a counter culture within them and having it burst out
6896240	6901680	through the dialectical process. So this is where all of this kind of came from. And that,
6901680	6905600	of course, redirected the goal of the Hegelian and Marxian thought that had been developing
6905600	6910560	up to that point, 1920, 1926, is what we're talking about right now, toward attacking
6910560	6918000	culture rather than attacking ideas or materialism, I guess, or attacking material
6918960	6924880	facets of life, like economics, particularly. So as can be identified, as you could hear in the
6924880	6929600	examples we gave earlier from Markuza, this has been core to the South Habendur Kulcher has been
6929600	6934880	core to the leftist program more or less ever since. Their goal is to tear down Western culture,
6934880	6940480	especially popular culture that makes people happy because as Markuza noted, you can be happy
6940480	6943600	you can be miserable when think you're happy. He talks about this in like almost everything he
6943600	6947440	writes, it's all through one dimensional man, it's in repressive tolerance, it's an essay on
6947440	6951600	liberation. All these people think that they're happy, but they're really miserable. And we gotta
6951600	6956240	use these critical methods to show them how miserable they are. As for Lukacs, by the way,
6956240	6961760	he's not a very pleasant guy. Here's what he has to say about what Alf Haben is really about in
6961760	6966560	the same essay, who will save us from Western civilization from 1920. He writes, in the last
6966560	6972480	analysis, the communist social order means the alphabong of the economy as an end in itself.
6973840	6979920	This is all the more true because this side of the transformation, the alphabong of the economy,
6979920	6985600	as an end in itself, cannot express itself in the surface appearances of life after the seizure
6985600	6991760	of power. Domination over the economy, that is what the socialist economy is, means the alphabong
6991760	6998480	of the autonomy of the economy. So destroying the economy for Lukacs is the socialist end in
6998480	7003680	itself. And the reason, according to Lukacs, is that it enables the seizure of power and thus
7003680	7009200	the domination of the economy, thus society. And that's what the socialist economy actually is.
7009200	7014720	He explicitly says that in 1920, and who will save us from Western civilization. So he advocates that
7015360	7022160	all of this abolishment, this destruction be turned toward culture rather than the economy,
7022160	7026960	so that the seizure of the culture of Western civilization can be accomplished.
7027600	7033280	That culture can then be, Western culture can then be destroyed. That would be an end in itself,
7033280	7037360	such that it will affect the seizure of power to affect domination. And that is the cultural
7037360	7042480	Marxist project. That is what the leftist project has been about through the entire cultural Marxist,
7042480	7049680	Neo-Marxist era, leading up at least until the very recent era. But I think that the woke is
7049680	7056000	actually a continuation of this. And Alphabendir Kulcher is their project today in many serious
7056000	7063520	ways. And this is Hegel's idea weaponized. Markus echoed the sentiment in an interview he did in
7063520	7069040	1969 on television, remarking that he only, quote, wants to designate what has to be overcome,
7069040	7075920	which in German is, I'm going to pronounce this probably, uberwunden, without entering the speculation
7075920	7079840	about the end result. There's no interest in looking at the end result. We just have to designate
7079840	7083680	what has to be overcome. That's where he said in the essay on liberation, if we can just tear away
7084400	7089840	the problems of society, the powers of society, the injustices of society, the seed of the true
7089840	7093760	better future, the liberated future will bloom and blossom and come out. This concurs with
7093760	7098240	Marxist critical philosophy that didn't seek to install its own ideology at all, but rather just
7098240	7104960	tear down the existing capitalist economy and figure it out from there. This is why I did a
7104960	7111360	whole podcast on communism doesn't know how. It also justifies Lukacs' bad attitude in general.
7111360	7115680	But generally, communism doesn't know how because it believes that the perfected society lives
7115680	7121680	underneath the flaws in culture. And if you can just tear down all of the so-called bad aspects
7121680	7126480	from their perspective of culture, then the perfected society will blossom out of this,
7126480	7133840	will grow out of this. And this is a alchemical, a hermetic idea. So alphabander culture is the
7133840	7139120	explanation for most of the Woe Clef's actions today, too. Why do we tear down statues? Why do
7139120	7142960	they get dumped in lakes? Why are they being defaced? Why are they being graffitied, etc.?
7142960	7146880	Because they are cultural icons that represent something about the culture. So you have to
7146880	7151840	abolish the culture, alphabander culture. Why are we destroying the idea of men and women,
7151840	7156480	or the worthiness of heterosexuality or having children? Why are we calling
7156480	7161280	mothers birthing persons? Alphabander culture, the cultural institution of the family,
7161280	7165120	is one of the five that Gramsci noted that has to be destroyed, infiltrated and destroyed.
7165120	7169920	Alphabander culture. Why are we canceling Dr. Seuss and damn near every other thing?
7169920	7175200	Alphabander culture. These are cultural podcasts about Dr. Seuss. These are pieces of the culture
7175200	7178640	that people can relate to one another. They understand one another based on whether it's
7178640	7182560	old movies, whether it's old cartoons, whether it's friends, whether the show friends, I mean,
7182560	7187920	whether it's Seinfeld, whether it's Dr. Seuss, whether it's Huckleberry Finn, whatever it is.
7188480	7191840	All of these things have to be abolished, whether it's to kill a Mockingbird because
7191840	7196640	they are cultural touch points that let us relate to one another. So, Alphabander culture.
7197360	7200320	Why are we painting Black Lives Matter on streets and putting it on the big green
7200320	7204960	monster during the baseball game? Alphabander culture. Why are we changing the names of schools
7204960	7208400	for people who allegedly were connected to historical evils?
7209040	7214720	Alphabander culture. Why are we decolonizing the curriculum? Which is really colonizing
7214720	7220480	the curriculum, by the way. Alphabander culture. Why did Ghostbusters do an all-women reboot or
7220480	7228160	Star Wars Episode 7 just be an inversion remaking Episode 4? All Alphabander culture. The idea is
7228160	7232960	to break down those cultural touch points and make it so that we have to now argue. We can't
7232960	7237440	talk about Ghostbusters without talking about this new Ghostbusters reboot. We can't understand
7237440	7241600	Episode 4 of Star Wars without having to compare it against the woke remake in Episode 7.
7242640	7247520	Alphabander culture. It makes it impossible to have cultural references that are solid and universal.
7248880	7255920	So, Alphabander is the tool that's like the heat in the fire. Dialectic is the fire that's
7255920	7264160	boiling the alchemy to purify society, to take away all those negative pieces, to purify everything
7264160	7268720	so that the seed of the perfected society as Marcuse had it can grow out. The dialectic has
7268720	7274400	therefore been the operating system of leftists. In a clear line, twisting and concentrating itself
7274400	7278720	all the way back at least to the young Hegelians who derived it directly from Hegel in a progressive
7278720	7286080	fashion last 200 years. So, that's mission number one. I know we're almost at two hours or maybe
7286080	7292480	past two hours. That's mission number one. The operating system of the left is fundamentally
7292480	7298000	the dialectic, and the dialectic is credited to Hegel. But there's something more that has to
7298000	7302320	be understood. This has to be understood as religious. It's not just philosophy. This is a
7302320	7308160	religion. This is a faith tradition, and it's engaged in with the same intensity of a faith,
7308160	7312000	and that's because Hegel had a metaphysics underneath what he was doing, and that metaphysics
7312000	7318400	even through Marx and his dialectical materialism has survived. Hegel, in fact, is what's known as
7318400	7323920	a theosophist, which is to say he has forwarded some religious philosophy or speculation about
7323920	7329360	the nature of reality in the soul that's based on mystical insights into the nature of God. Like I
7329360	7335280	said, his speculation is mysticism. We're going to back that up here in a second. For Hegel,
7335280	7340640	the idea of God is what he called the absolute, or sometimes the idea or the absolute idea,
7341600	7347040	which is what you get when the ideas of the world become perfected and aware of their own
7347040	7351760	perfection, which is achieved through the process of the dialectic progressing history.
7352800	7357600	That's the historicism that Engels prays so strongly in Hegel's philosophy,
7357600	7361600	even as he complained about Hegel's dialectic itself and its inapplicability.
7362320	7365760	Marx had this same idea, too, but his metaphysics was a kind of
7365760	7371120	scientistic, again, not scientific materialism, which he called dialectical materialism.
7371120	7374960	I'm going to mess it up again. We're going to go for the German. Wiesenschaff, Leutcher,
7375520	7380880	Socialismus, scientific socialism in English at any rate, which isn't science at all.
7382480	7387120	So remember what Marx had said. This is one of the first quotes that I read in this podcast,
7387120	7391360	with Hegel, and I'm inserting the names a little bit for clarity, with Hegel the dialectic
7391440	7396480	standing on its head. It must be turned right side up again if you would discover the rational
7396480	7401760	kernel within the mystical shell. So this mysticism is key to Hegel's metaphysics.
7401760	7405440	Marx thought he was getting rid of it, but he actually isn't, as we're going to uncover.
7406560	7413120	So the essence of Hegel's speculative idealism is a mystical shell. It turns out, as I've been
7413120	7418640	saying, a hermetic, alchemical metaphysics based in mysticism and nosticism. In other words,
7418640	7427200	knowing the secrets of God or whatever. Marx rejected the mysticism, or so he thought,
7427200	7432160	in favor of materialism, dialectical materialism. But because dialectical materialism, communism
7432160	7439360	doesn't know how, because he retained the Hegelian drive as a very potent imaginator of new ideas
7439360	7443200	in society, and he didn't know how they were going to get to communism that was just going to happen,
7443760	7448240	he didn't really get away from it. He was still trying to drive the progress of history.
7448240	7455280	Marx and Engels were fans of Hegel's historicism, which was predicated off of his
7456240	7461040	metaphysics, and he's still trying to drive this. So Marx claimed he got rid of the mysticism
7461040	7468800	through turning it into dialectical materialism, but maybe he did just enough, I guess,
7468800	7472400	as a way to put it, because this is the primary reason why the US Supreme Court rejected the
7472400	7476240	claim that communism or Marxism constitutes a religion. It's because this materialist,
7476240	7480400	it doesn't have a God or whatever. This is despite what both the father of cultural Marxism,
7480400	7485760	Antonio Gramsci, and defected Communist Party USA leader, Dr. Beladad, both had to say about it.
7485760	7491360	Gramsci said, and I quote, socialism is precisely the religion that must overwhelm Christianity,
7491360	7496400	with overwhelm being in the uberwunden sense that we just talked about a minute ago,
7496400	7501600	had he been writing in German rather than in Italian. Beladad had it this way,
7501760	7509040	she was one of the leaders of the US Communist Party, and in 1953 she testified to the House
7509040	7513040	Committee on Un-American Activities, and she explained how we have to fight communism differently
7513040	7517920	and what communism's ideas and goals are, and she said in that testimony that communism is like a
7517920	7524080	religion. President Eisenhower said the other day, but it is religion without a God. If you
7524080	7528640	believe strongly in communism, it is your duty to bring it into every phase of your life.
7528640	7533280	Communism is a way of life, and it is almost like a religion. It becomes a part of you. It
7533280	7537920	affects your entire thinking. It affects your attitude toward your students, toward your government,
7537920	7541920	affects your attitude toward things that are happening day by day. Most communist college
7541920	7546080	professors begin by being very much interested in their students, and if they have a communist
7546080	7555360	philosophy, they pass it on. So communism is very much like a religion. This is one of the
7555360	7561040	leaders of the Communist Party was saying in 1953. So the Marx rejected Hegel's mysticism.
7563040	7567840	He had such unrealistic and largely Hegelian beliefs about how history would progress in
7567840	7572960	the material world would evolve that they could be considered somewhat mystical in their own right.
7572960	7576800	His communism doesn't know how. You just peel away all the problems and the perfect society
7576800	7582640	will emerge. The consciousness he believed would awaken, the revolution would come,
7582720	7586560	there would be the class consciousness of the proletariat, the revolution would come,
7586560	7591520	proletarian revolution. The managed state economy would then emerge and take over in a
7591520	7595440	state of socialism and then would eventually, through the dialectical materialist process,
7595440	7600400	realize its own redundancy and a communist utopia would emerge from this as all of the,
7600400	7603840	as the dialectical materialism purified all of the bad ideas out of the state.
7604560	7609760	Marx was really just an applied young Hegelian. He applied young Hegelianism
7610640	7616720	by dropping the overt mysticism while keeping all of the social alchemy. So the core, the alchemical
7616720	7623760	core is still present in Marx and that derived from Hegel and his metaphysics, which is key to
7623760	7628880	understanding what's going on. So Marx has kept alive the religious for, not just for communism,
7628880	7634000	but also all of its Hegelian roots. And the Hegel for Beginners section, for example, of the Marxist
7634000	7639040	Internet Archive, they write gushingly of their intellectual progenitor, meaning Hegel,
7639760	7644400	who was ultimately one of Marx's inspirations. They write, reading Hegel gives one a sense that
7644400	7648480	the movement of thought will coincide with a vision of harmony that awaits us at the
7648480	7653520	end of the whole process, the end of history. Every serious reader of Hegel can bear witness
7653520	7659280	to the intoxication of such moments, intoxication. That's exactly what I'm talking about. And this
7659280	7664560	is where the communism doesn't know how. Faith based part comes in. Marx derived that from Hegel
7664560	7667680	and maintained it in his own vision, which was then readily taken up by his followers and then
7667680	7674480	evolved into neo-Marxism and eventually wokeism. The postmodernist kind of lost faith, if you will.
7675440	7679440	The neo-Marxists, so thus the woke, have retained, like I said, this thought. They brought it back
7679440	7685680	into a more mystical frame by abandoning the solid material side of this and focusing instead on
7685680	7692480	culture, which I'm going to insist in Hegelian form is on geist, what Hegel called geist or spirit.
7693360	7698480	This religious zeal, though, is palpable, for example, when you read Markuza talking about
7698480	7704320	liberation or you read Alison Bailey talking about how she abuses her students. It's obvious in all
7704320	7710320	of the major works of the 1960s from Markuza, his earlier eros and civilization, where he waxes
7710320	7714560	poetic almost about how a certain sexual liberation, it's clear what he's talking about, sexual
7714560	7721280	liberation freeing the eros, which is subordinated by the demands of consumer and capitalist culture
7721360	7726160	to do productive work through something like the Protestant work ethic. Your sexual drives are
7726160	7731200	subordinated, your id is subordinated, and rather than being able to find healthy expressions, you
7731200	7734640	feel like you're happy in a society where you're not, but if you could just be liberated sexually,
7734640	7740480	you'd be freefall. This is why I said before reading Markuza, at least in eros and civilization,
7740480	7743600	you get the impression they just want to have orgies a lot, which when you look at them,
7743600	7749520	it's totally gross. But anyway, his goal in that book was to marry Marks and Freud
7749520	7754560	philosophically, and that's a forced marriage if I've ever heard of one. But all this pulls us
7754560	7758880	back to Hegel again. So let's go back to Hegel and get into his metaphysical a little bit,
7758880	7765280	but first his goals. Hegel really was driven very religiously, in fact, to try to create
7765280	7770480	a metaphysical faith system for a Germany that wasn't going to rely on what he believed was
7770480	7776080	the Orientalism, the intrusion of Christianity, which was a Middle Eastern religion unbecoming of
7777040	7784080	Germanic peoples and pride. So he believed that he could develop a new metaphysical new religion
7784080	7789360	and the German folk identity. And he wanted to reinstate this folk identity and his folk
7789360	7794480	religion. He was also very pro-Germany. You can read that, for example, if you read where he's
7794480	7801200	been analyzed by Benedict Viviano, where is written in its classic form, Hegel's philosophy of history
7801200	7805840	concludes that Prussia is the present and permanent incarnation of the Holy Spirit,
7805840	7809600	and that it is God's will that Prussia should conquer and govern the world,
7810480	7816160	or so was understood. Such an understanding led to the First World War, I would say it probably
7816160	7824720	led to the Second One too. Hitler was a Hegelian, it turns out. His trajectory was a little bit
7824720	7833120	different, more kind of through the thoughts of Heidegger. But anyway, Hegel wanted to retain
7833120	7837680	his metaphysics. He wanted his metaphysics to give the Germans back a sense of national identity
7837680	7843520	and pride and to perfect the German state. This turned out to be expressed in a way that went
7843520	7848720	pretty badly wrong at least twice in the 20th century, and that was all done on the back of
7848720	7855200	broadly Hegelian projects. People who picked up Hegel led to the First and Second World Wars
7855200	7863280	in their German pride. Also as a speculative idealist, coming back to that, Hegel's very centered
7863280	7870320	on the ways that ideas shape society and defined, and as a result, he defined a systematic philosophy,
7870320	7874160	which is not that far off from a systematic theology. Once you understand his underlying
7874160	7881200	motivations or systematic theosophy, I should say, as his theosophist, that approaches how ideas are
7881200	7885040	supposed to be formed, refined, understood, and eventually incorporated into society. That's his
7885040	7890000	applicable side, and the dialectic was the engine. He wanted to also analyze how this is supposed
7890000	7895920	to occur. Speculation and mysticism is how it was to be approached. For example, in his lectures
7895920	7902800	that he gave in 1827, Hegel states, quote, As a whole, the mystical is everything speculative,
7902800	7907520	or whatever is concealed from the understanding. And in his lectures on the philosophy of religion
7907520	7915760	in 1824, Hegel speaks of the so-called Ellucinian mysteries, stating that the mystical is the
7915760	7921360	speculative what lies within. So like I said, when he says speculative, like we saw with Alphabon,
7921360	7928800	he means mystical. In the Encyclopedia Logic, Hegel writes that it should be mentioned here
7928800	7933520	that the meaning of the speculative is to be understood as being the same as what is used in
7933520	7940320	earlier times is called the mystical. He also states, this is kind of very important, we're
7940320	7946800	going to focus on this next, that the trinity is called the mystery of God. Its content is mystical,
7947440	7952640	that is speculative. This bit about the trinity is going to be really important to understanding
7952640	7958160	his metaphysics as a speculative idealist who is grappling with the ideas of his time and
7958160	7963760	challenging the idea of Christianity, which he saw as an Orientalist intrusion into the German
7963760	7969680	folk arena. So at the center of Hegel's metaphysics then, as a speculative idealist,
7969680	7974240	are the ideas of society. So we're going to lay some groundwork for this and then move into
7974240	7979600	this Trinitarian thing. So in particular for him, the absolute idea, which represents the
7979600	7984960	culmination and kind of actualization of all ideas in a perfected form. So let's turn back
7984960	7990880	to our friends at marxist.org and we'll see that this is actually explicitly a metaphysical
7990880	7997840	conception of what ideas are. So they write, the absolute idea, this is the entry on absolute idea,
7997840	8004080	by the way, is both the apex and foundation of the philosophical system of Hegel. It includes
8004080	8009120	all the stages of logic leading up to it, is the process of development with all of its stages and
8009120	8015680	transitions. The absolute idea or world spirit, Weltgeist in German, plays the same kind of role
8015680	8021840	for Hegel as a deity. Quote, history is the idea clothing itself with the form of events, that's
8021840	8027600	in the philosophy of right, section 346, according to these guys at marxist.org, and they continue,
8027600	8032560	and Marx rejects the need for any such concept since history is a product of people, not the other way
8032560	8039920	around. Like absolute truth, knowledge of the absolute idea is an unattainable ideal, representing
8039920	8044400	the whole of nature which has developed to the point where it is conscious of itself, or the
8044400	8049680	concept of nature developed to such a degree of concreteness that it has returned to itself,
8049680	8055600	recollected itself if you will, an absolutely comprehensive, practical, and concrete concept
8055600	8060720	of the world. Hegel defines the absolute idea as the quote, unity of the theoretical idea and
8060720	8067280	the practical idea. The theoretical idea is the completed notion or concrete concept of the world
8067280	8075040	or object. The practical idea is the activity expressing this concept, practice. The unity of
8075040	8080720	the two means fully conscious practice, people acting in true accord with their own nature.
8081520	8086800	So, for whatever rejecting of Hegel's mysticism that Marx did, you can see that his instruction
8086800	8092240	to wed theory to praxis, which is ran into conscious practice, praxis, that's what Marx is
8092240	8096560	talking about, his instruction to wed theory to practice, which is maintained to this day in both
8097200	8102080	Marxism and Neo-Marxism, and also it appears in the derived woke literature and activism,
8102080	8109680	especially in critical pedagogy, education, and critical theory. These all demand that
8110560	8116560	this element of social activism are present to qualify as a critical theory, and all of this
8116560	8120960	is readily derived from Hegel's idea of the theoretical idea and the practical idea. Remember
8120960	8124240	when I said earlier that we're going to talk about the theoretical and the practical idea? So,
8124240	8129360	there's two ideas. The theoretical, there's your thesis, meeting the practical where it runs into
8129360	8134000	the world, there's your antithesis, and he sees the absolute as the final synthesis of the theoretical
8134000	8139600	and the practical within his dialectical framework. And for Marx, praxis is the kind of materialist
8139600	8145440	manifestation where this is occurring. It is the vehicle of the dialectic. So, the metaphysical
8145440	8151280	point here for Hegel is unavoidable. The absolute plays the role of deity. This is what the Marxists
8151280	8155840	say about it, the whole of nature when it has developed to a point that it's conscious of itself
8155840	8161360	and has so become concrete, in other words, synthetic in the dialectical language, and that it has
8161360	8167760	returned to or recollected itself in speculative or mystical philosophy. So, here we can turn to
8167760	8173680	the trinity and understand Hegel's views, the metaphysical spiral, as I would phrase it. So,
8173680	8178320	we'll begin by talking about a letter that Hegel wrote in 1816 where he remarks, quote,
8178320	8183920	I stick to this idea that the spirit of time has given the order to move forward. This order has
8183920	8190000	been obeyed. This being is moving forward, irresistibly like an armored and compact phalanx,
8190560	8195200	and with a movement as imperceptible as the sun's, through good and bad roads, countless
8195200	8199200	light troops against him and for him flank him everywhere. So, what he's talking about here is
8199200	8203520	that the idea that history or the spirit of time is moving forward irresistibly, and it's actually
8203520	8207840	invincible. You can't change the course of history. It's going to do what it's going to do. It moves
8207840	8212160	slowly and steadily, but like the sun, there's undeniable movement. You look now, you look later,
8212160	8215920	it's clearly moved, but you'll never see it moving in any moment, unless maybe it's right
8215920	8219520	along the horizon or something. And it also moves through both good and bad roads. In other words,
8219520	8223120	it does things that are clearly going to be perceived as progress, and it's going to do
8223120	8227360	things that are not perceived as progress, but they still count as progress because this is the
8227360	8231920	progress of history. And it's going to be carried along by countless light troops, some of which
8232000	8236400	are for and some of which are against. So, you're going to have people arguing on both sides of
8236400	8240400	what they believe is the right direction of history. So, it could be that you have this great
8240400	8243760	leader that people are supporting, and he's not actually doing a great job, or you could have
8243760	8249200	this horrific dictator, and people oppose this person, but this is just the march of history,
8249200	8254400	according to how Hegel conceived. And this is for him how the absolute, this perfect thing,
8254400	8261280	moves along through an arc of time called history. And the goal is that the absolute is going to
8261280	8266320	use the unfolding of history to come to understand itself, and in the instant the absolute understands
8266320	8271200	itself as the absolute, history will end. In other words, we'll hit what you might call the
8271200	8278000	eschaton, the end of the world in kind of a kind of religious language. It's important to realize
8278000	8282160	though that Hegel's thinking endlessly in triads, just like his dialectic. You have thesis,
8282160	8286880	antithesis, synthesis, technically I guess that's Kant's, which you have abstract negative concrete,
8286880	8291360	these triads. You have objective spirit, subjective spirit, absolute spirit, theorist,
8291360	8296160	theory, practice, and their synthesis in what Marx called praxis, which is theoretically driven
8296160	8301120	activism, which Pauline Christians would probably call evangelism. So, when Marx says that we have
8301120	8305040	to have theory wetted to praxis, what he's actually saying is you have to be an evangelist on behalf
8305040	8310080	of Marxism, and do activism, which would be the kinds of things that Christians tend to do like
8310080	8316480	tending to the poor and acting in charity. But two other big triads we have to focus on are
8316720	8321840	for Hegel are being and nothing. There's your thesis in antithesis, being and nothing,
8321840	8328480	and his synthesis there, or the concrete, is becoming. Being, nothing, and becoming form a
8328480	8336880	Hegelian synthetic triad. Being, nothing, and becoming. And then another is ideas, nature,
8336880	8341600	and geist. In other words, the ideas, the natural world as it manifests in the spirit.
8342400	8347040	So, these last two triads become crucial to understanding Hegelian metaphysics.
8347040	8350720	This is because he had to grapple with, he had these because in particular he was grapple,
8350720	8354880	I mean, being and nothing are pretty fundamental philosophical concepts, but they're also important
8354880	8359680	if you're looking even in the Judeo-Christian context. But certainly, the idea of these kind
8359680	8362640	of trinities is very important to grapple with, if he's going to grapple with the
8364480	8369600	Christian trinity and make sense of it, as he wanted to, because he wanted to synthesize
8369600	8374800	out of the Orientalist Christian imposition, which was an antithesis for him to the German
8374800	8380800	folk religion, and create a new metaphysics, a new systematic theosophy for the German folk
8380800	8386320	religion that he hoped for. He wanted to understand in particular, because he was kind of a monist,
8386320	8390960	in a sense. He wanted to understand in particular how Christianity was just manifest, one narrow
8392000	8399440	manifestation of a more complete picture, what would have been called in the old Hermetic tradition,
8399440	8405200	a Prisket theologica, a pristine theology, if you will, or a primordial theology,
8406160	8410960	or he was also interested in the development, the absolute would actually be representative of
8410960	8416480	what would be called a philosophia perennis. And that was his goal, was to get back to,
8416480	8421120	to recollect the philosophia perennis, the perennial philosophy. That's the perfect
8421120	8427040	expression of philosophy that's held up in the, or exists in, I should say, the absolute.
8427600	8430960	So these are both big ideas that we're going to come back to later as well. But the general idea
8430960	8436560	here, just to kind of summarize this, that Prisket theologia is a, is a Hermetic concept,
8436560	8441920	in other words, an alchemy concept, that there's some primordial or pristine original theology,
8441920	8445680	that all of the world's faiths and philosophies lend partial insight to. They're like
8446240	8450080	fragmented. You can imagine, like, there's one true faith, and it's like a mirror,
8450080	8454240	and it's been smashed. And, you know, all the pieces are on the ground, and they're reflecting
8454320	8457760	different parts. And this one's reflecting Christianity, and this one's reflecting
8457760	8461040	Buddhism, and this one's reflecting Islam, and this one's reflecting Judaism, and this one's
8461040	8465840	reflecting Jainism, and whatever. And they're all lending partial insight to the real thing.
8465840	8470960	But if they could just be made to converge, then you can get to that original, one true
8470960	8477040	theology, the Prisket theologia. And the alchemy, alchemy is how that's done, because the fragments
8477040	8482240	of this true philosophy appear in all of these junky worldly forms, base metal forms. If you
8482240	8488080	could just purify, you could get the seeds of the true philosophy, the original philosophy,
8488080	8491840	the primordial philosophy to sprout out of this, then you could get back to this
8491840	8499520	Prisket theologia through an alchemical convergence of the various different faiths of the world,
8499520	8506800	for example. You could also reach, if he's more interested, Prisket theologia has this ancient,
8507360	8516160	old, gone primordial aspect to it. Philosophia parenis has a different kind of eternal, and that's
8516160	8519920	where his absolute really was. And that's what he's really interested in. He's using the Prisket
8519920	8526800	theologia as a model, this idea that he took out of the Hermetic literature as a model to get toward
8526800	8531680	this perennial philosophy, which is what the absolute actually is. And that'll be able to
8531680	8536240	be recovered or recollected alchemically from the various faiths and philosophies of the world
8536240	8540320	by means of his speculative approach and systematic philosophy. Ultimately, what he calls
8541520	8547840	translated as reason, he calls Vernunft, which we're also going to spend some time on that later,
8547840	8555520	and I point to pronouncing it as Vernunft. I'm working on it, my German. So to kind of drive home
8555520	8560480	this is all still very metaphysical for Hegel, very religious. Hegel has it in his lectures in
8560560	8568160	the philosophy of religion. Philosophy is only explicating itself when it explicates religion,
8568160	8572640	and when it explicates itself, it is explicating religion. So for him, philosophy, in other words,
8572640	8577040	reason is religious. He goes on to say the trinity to draw back to that trinity because we're looking
8577040	8583280	at these triads that he's interested in for his dialectic, et cetera, and some of these key examples.
8583280	8588560	The trinity is called the mystery of God. Its content is mystical, i.e. speculative. These are
8588560	8593840	two things that Hegel says in his lectures on the philosophy of religion. So now we can take
8593840	8598320	a closer look at the way that Hegel would conceive of the trinity, and I want to focus. We could
8598320	8603840	talk about, and I will briefly, let me talk about being nothing and becoming. We're going to come
8603840	8611120	back to the idea of becoming, but being God is I am the I am. It is being, and it is in contrast to
8611120	8615280	the great philosophical question of why is there something rather than nothing. So being is contrast
8615280	8620240	to nothing, and he says that becoming is the resolution, the synthesis of understanding this
8620240	8625440	mystery. But he has this other trinity that he's very interested in, which is idea, nature, and
8625440	8633040	spirit, or geist. So as an idealist, he's centered on the ideas of society. The reason is how you
8633040	8638800	engage with them, or reason itself is the expression of the ideas. These take the place of God the
8638800	8644080	Father as the absolute, as we've already heard from the Marxists. The natural world for him then
8644080	8650800	becomes like the manifestation of this on earth, and so it's like the Son, or Jesus. But the natural
8650800	8656240	world is disordered in and of itself, and is not that interesting for somebody like Hegel who's
8656240	8662640	putting forth a systematic philosophy. And so Hegel has this statement, the state is the divine idea
8662640	8669360	as it is expressed on earth. So the state becomes, in this Trinitarian metaphor, the Son. So you have
8669360	8675360	the ideas are the Father, the state becomes the Son, and geist or spirit are the various
8675360	8681760	normativities of culture in some sense. Those are indicative of the Holy Spirit. So his trinity
8681760	8689680	become the ideas, the state, and the spirit of the world as they're developing. But he does not
8689680	8693760	have a Christological understanding of this, or a Christian understanding of this, I guess I should
8693760	8699840	say. Christianity holds these things, Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, to be co-eternal as three aspects
8699840	8709040	of one eternal and perfect Godhead. God which manifests in the Word as the Logos of John becomes
8709040	8715040	flesh in the world in Christ, and the Holy Spirit is that which is God moving within and through
8715040	8720640	the world. And these things are co-eternal. They are one thing as three things. And this is how the
8720720	8725680	Christian metaphysic understands it. This isn't how Hegel sees it, because Hegel sees things
8725680	8732800	in a process-oriented or evolutionary-oriented fashion. Specifically, Hegel believes that God,
8734240	8740000	when you talk about God, that's God merely in himself, or God in potentia as an abstract,
8740720	8747680	as a Logos, or as a reason. And that's insufficient to be truly a deity, because the absolute to be
8747680	8753520	complete would have to not just be abstract, which is the beginning of His dialectical process,
8753520	8759760	but be concrete. So God cannot merely be abstract. He has to be concrete. So He has to meet His
8759760	8767840	negative and then come to synthesis in order to be completed. So this is a fundamental contradiction,
8767840	8772800	or creates a fundamental contradiction for Hegel in the site for his dialectic, because a God that
8772800	8778560	is abstract is not concrete, and a God that is concrete is not abstract. So there's our contradiction.
8778560	8783600	So a synthesis will be needed to reconcile these. And that synthesis is the realized absolute. And
8783600	8788800	here's where we come back to being nothing and becoming, is the absolute who becomes absolute,
8789680	8798480	only by his realization of himself as a synthetic to both abstraction as an idea and worldly concreteness.
8798880	8808640	So which is expressed in nature, and then nature as regulated by the state, which is the divine
8808640	8815120	idea expressed on earth. He also sees God as imminent in the world. So this is kind of a
8815120	8821920	panentheist view rather than a traditional Christian view. God is not transcendent to the
8821920	8827200	world for Hegel. Hegel's view is that these three things, the idea or nature in the state,
8827200	8832880	and then geist, are so-called moments of the concept. Moments are things that can't be reduced.
8832880	8837360	So if I had a puzzle, for example, I could take all the pieces apart and you could say,
8837360	8841680	here's all these pieces, and I could take it apart. But if I have something like color,
8841680	8847600	which is constructed of hue and shade and saturation or whatever, I can't take those
8847600	8851760	things apart and still have the color. I can't take a color apart, but it has these different
8851760	8855920	components. So a moment is like a thing that has components that can't be taken apart.
8856880	8861760	And so these things are moments of the concept. The concept is kind of this key thing at the
8861760	8867120	center of his metaphysics, and he compares this to the alchemical elements of mercury, sulfur,
8867120	8871200	and salt because he's actually an alchemist. And he does this while outlining a systematic
8871200	8876160	philosophy that uses the dialectic to negate each of these moments and allow for it to give rise to
8876160	8881040	the next, so that the spirit as absolute might eventually bloom. This is where you have that
8881040	8885440	idea, like the absolute is like the seed. It's contained within all of this, and we can just
8885440	8890160	peel away all of the bad idea, all the bad parts, the imperfected parts of the idea,
8891280	8899520	then the ideal or perfected spirit, the absolute, the veldgeist might bloom. And this is just like
8899520	8905280	alchemists hold that gold is believed to bloom from its seeds that are contained in every base
8905280	8910000	metal and other materials. It's just like Markuza believed that liberation exists,
8910000	8915040	like a seed inside of a corrupted society, that if we could just figure out how to do alphabe
8915040	8921680	into it correctly so that we could keep that seed while tearing away the rest of the junk,
8921680	8927280	then it would be able to blossom and take off. So for Hegel, this is his metaphysics. Again,
8927280	8932160	the ideas take earthly form in nature and in the world, and they're managed under the concept of
8932160	8937520	the state. So the divine idea expresses itself through the state. So an inclination towards
8937520	8942640	statism in Hegelian philosophy has a metaphysical imperative. It's not only obvious, but has a
8942640	8947840	metaphysical imperative. The state in turn then sets the material conditions for society, which
8947840	8952000	gives rise to how people live. It gives rise to the spirit that they live under, or in other words,
8952000	8956960	the culture, which we'll call the geist of that nation or society or the world, maybe,
8956960	8961360	when it's all perfected and it's the world, and it will be the veldgeist. And this is where the
8961360	8967760	goal is to try to head to. The geist then in turn, though, because each moment negates the previous.
8967760	8972720	The geist is then going to be able to refine how the prevailing ideas, the philosophy, using the
8972720	8978400	dialectic and alphabe, by finding the contradictions in that new structure. The ideas are coming down,
8978400	8983680	the state is implementing them, the culture that arises, and things still aren't perfect,
8983680	8988000	and the people in the culture are going to start discovering the problems. And so the geist is
8988000	8992480	then going to take the next level of refining, and the more conscious they are, the more consciousness
8992480	8996240	they have, the more ability they're going to have to refine these ideas. And that's going to give
8996240	9001600	rise to a new iteration of improved ideas, allowing this process to repeat. So we no longer have this
9001600	9006720	kind of eternal God that is Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. We now have this ideas as God,
9007520	9016320	state as Son, and geist or culture as spirit. And rather than just being three in one, we now have
9016320	9021920	this kind of spiraling process where one gives rise to an improved version of the past, of the
9021920	9026080	next, or whatever, or of the previous, I should say. So we have this spiraling through history,
9026080	9032400	where a new improved state follows from the new improved ideas, usually, as Hegel had it,
9032400	9037200	through the activity of a man of action that is being used by history, which has its talos of
9037200	9041600	purpose to it. And this is going to create new conditions, and that's a new geist, which is,
9041600	9045600	in a sense, a new culture. And that's going to start the process all over again. So you have this
9045760	9052800	spiraling through history of ideas, state, spirit, improving as they go along the trajectory of
9052800	9058320	history. That's Hegelian metaphysics. So in a sense, the Trinity is not transcendent and eternal,
9058320	9064720	it's imminent, and it's a process. It isn't, it's becoming. It isn't perfect, it's perfectable,
9064720	9068960	and perfecting through the process of history. In other words, it's heading toward the emergence
9068960	9073680	or the recollection of that philosophy, Perennis, the Perennial philosophy, by speculatively,
9073680	9080560	which is, say, mystically trying to recollect the Priska Theologia. This is a very alchemical
9080560	9085920	approach to this Trinity. This is Hegel's philosophy on this. Philosophy is how this is
9085920	9091200	going to be done for Hegel, reason, for an umpt. Because that's how the geist informs the philosophers
9091200	9096400	to improve the ideas, and the process that Hegel recommends to do this is the dialectic, which
9096400	9100640	is through seeking those contradictions, but while keeping that essential core. In other words,
9100640	9107040	Alfhaben. The reason for this is ultimately the alchemy, the Hermeticism that he based a lot of
9107040	9111600	his thought on, because he was an alchemist. It's also because he's a Gnostic, and he believed
9111600	9116640	that his ideas of reason were higher, and they understood things better. So for Hegel, though,
9116640	9120480	the Godhead isn't a thing that is in the world, or is transcendent to the world, I should say,
9120480	9125840	but merely is, it's a process that spirals through and creates history as it goes. Again,
9125840	9130240	ideas give rise to a state. Father begets son. This creates conditions for a spirit
9130800	9135280	that then flows back into the Father, which is now more self-aware than it was before,
9135280	9139040	and this unfolding of history and refinement of ideas are one and the same.
9140240	9146320	For Hegel, this deity is absolute spirit, or the absolute, or the absolute idea. It is the
9146320	9150800	ultimate synthesis of all of the subjective spirit and objective spirit through the dialectical
9150800	9157120	process. It's the synthesis of the theoretical and the practical. It is what happens when the
9157120	9167120	abstract God meets his negation in the worldly squalor and is synthesized into the absolute,
9168960	9174320	into something that is becoming absolute, I really should say, into becoming, so being nothing
9175200	9181360	and becoming. So while the absolute is always the absolute and the Hegelian metaphysic,
9181360	9184960	the deal is that the absolute doesn't know that it's absolute until its ideas are perfected.
9184960	9193280	So God isn't God until God, God isn't God if he's just an idea, if he's just transcendent. God has
9193280	9199520	to be in the world and also transcendent, and that has to be synthesized. So that's what the absolute
9199520	9206000	is. It has to be a God that is out of the world and in the world and simultaneously aware of itself
9206000	9211840	as such. That synthesis has to arrive, and the name for that synthesis is the absolute.
9211840	9216800	And when that occurs, the so-called ideas of the society, thus the state that flows from it, thus
9216800	9220320	the spirit of the people, are all going to be perfected. And that's what Marx thought would be
9220320	9225600	the communist state, or that's what Marcuse thinks is liberation. That's what you see when you talk
9225600	9229520	about black liberation. That's what you see when you hear people talking about racial justice
9229520	9234640	or racial liberation or whatever liberation they're all talking about today in the woke thing.
9234640	9239600	So God for Hegel doesn't become God until God realizes that he's God, which is required,
9239600	9248080	or which occurs only after God makes creation as a dialectical other to himself to compare
9248080	9252000	himself against, and the process unfolds itself all the way until the plurennial
9252080	9257760	philosophy is remembered as a result. That's, I guess, very complicated, but it kind of
9257760	9262000	bounced back to Judeo-Christianity to make it more simple. The Judeo-Christian metaphysic
9262000	9267120	God is. I am the I am. I am the often the Omega, the thing that is before, beginning and after the
9267120	9273760	end, eternal, perfect, etc. God creates the world because it is his will as the creator to do so.
9274320	9280960	And the Hegelian metaphysics God as absolute becomes rather than is through a process of
9282960	9288160	having the world and reflecting himself against the world and refining in that process the ideas
9288160	9293680	of the world via that above described spiral process. So the absolute becomes truly absolute
9293680	9300880	only when it is both abstract and concrete and realizes itself to be such, and thus it becomes
9300960	9305520	the absolute. It realizes itself as the absolute, or it actualizes itself, realizes itself for the
9305520	9312160	words that you often see around this. So this absolute then becomes the last idea to be perfected.
9313600	9320160	The realization that God realizing himself is the last idea to be perfected. So a God that
9320160	9324880	everything's perfect except he doesn't realize that everything's perfect yet is the last step
9324880	9330240	before the perfected God. So that last idea to be perfected is God realizing himself as God.
9330240	9336160	So God realizing himself as God becomes the final perfected idea after which time the ideas become
9336160	9340000	perfect and again the state becomes perfect so the spirit and culture become perfect and history
9340000	9349040	reaches its end and utopia begins. And that is the Hegelian historicist metaphysic that is driven
9349040	9357200	through the alchemical method of dialectic that burns off or tears away the incorrect ideas,
9357200	9363200	the failures of history, the things that have to be taken apart via the process of alphaben which
9363200	9371040	is to destroy and yet keep. So Hegel frames this out roughly as God creating in the world itself
9371040	9378720	as some other to itself as an abstract idea. So now you have the abstract God creates a negation,
9378720	9384480	the negative, the other which is the world by which he will be able to know himself that is
9384480	9388240	through hermetic theosophy, that is the definition of hermetic theosophy,
9388240	9394960	that God requires the world to realize that he's God and that is the heart of the Hegelian thought.
9394960	9401600	This perfect being, so the absolute represents or the deity represents a perfect being say that he
9401600	9407280	doesn't know that he's perfect. So he creates this imperfect world, so that's the Prisket theologia for
9407280	9411840	example would be the theology that understands that God. So he creates this imperfect world
9411840	9415840	as an antithesis to his own perfection and then through the process of dialectical synthesis
9415840	9420720	which will be carried out by philosophers, politicians, so-called men of action who are
9420720	9424800	summoned by history for the purpose of driving the theosophy history, he will eventually be
9424800	9429840	able to be made aware of himself as absolute. The philosophers and so on drive this because they
9429840	9434160	are the ones who work with the ideas and exist within the spirit or the geist, the culture,
9434160	9440560	the national or world level be that a national geist or a world geist,
9440560	9447040	Weltgeist in German. But again, ultimately this is alchemy, this is hermeticism. It means a lot
9447040	9451760	more specifically if we get into what hermeticism is really about, but the root of hermeticism is
9451760	9456640	the belief that God requires creation to be God and that he learns that he is God through his
9456640	9463920	creation. This is a complete rejection of the Christian metaphysics where God is, God is transcendent
9463920	9468560	and God doesn't need his creation, he created it because he wanted to. It was his will.
9470080	9476160	Hegel the alchemist applies his alchemical thoughts to metaphysics and what arises is his view of
9476160	9481280	phenomenology and ultimately the dialectic that's supposed to drive this. This is why what we're
9481280	9485680	dealing with, with the woke, with the neo-Marxists, less with the postmodernists, they get complicated
9485680	9490720	because they were despairing, they lost the faith. With the Marxists before them, with the young
9490720	9495600	Hegelians before them, that's why what we see is this long 200-year-long religion that's manifesting
9495600	9501280	in different ways and it's all the Hegelian metaphysics applied to basically create the
9501280	9506400	perfected society by a bunch of, frankly, megalomaniacs who think that they know how to do it,
9506400	9512560	they know what the perfect society looks like and they try to approach it. So with Marx and later
9512560	9517760	the neo-Marxists, they're not as up on all this mysticism, all this alchemy in the specific sense,
9517760	9522480	maybe with the exception of Walter Benjamin, he's an early Frankfurt school guy who was actually a
9522480	9526800	Jewish mystic. He maybe is an important exception, but most of them weren't that deep into the
9526800	9531600	mysticism. Marx certainly wasn't deep into the mysticism unless you want to try to classify him
9531600	9538960	as a Satanist, which there are Marx quotes that would support that. But anyway, none of this
9541120	9545440	deeper engine of Hegel though, despite the fact that they get rid of the so-called mystical shell
9545440	9549360	to get to that kernel, that's what Marx was talking about. None of the engine really goes away.
9549360	9555920	The dialectical process, a lot of the alchemical belief is still presently there. Marx reframed
9555920	9560720	things in a material way. He talked about ideology, superstructure, and society. Well,
9560720	9567120	there's your ideas, state, and spirit. These are echoes that persist all the way down. For
9567120	9571440	example, in Critical Race Theory today, we have white supremacy as the ideology that gives rise
9571440	9577680	to a systemic racism superstructure of society that thus creates an inequitable society and a
9578560	9583040	imperfect spirit. And the critical race consciousness, like Marx's class consciousness,
9583840	9587680	is to be awakened by the critical race theorists, and that will lead people to challenge this
9587680	9591120	existing status quo through a dialectical process that we heard from many black feminists and
9591120	9596880	critical race theorists already. That will result in a revolution at the level of culture,
9596880	9601120	a cultural revolution, whereas that had ever been tried before, that eventually brings equity
9601120	9606880	and racial justice, and it's going to refine the ideology out of white supremacy. And the
9606880	9613440	ideology will therefore give rise to a not systemically racist superstructure, and we enter
9613440	9619360	into a post-racial utopia. And that's really what the goal of Critical Race Theory is, but it has no
9619360	9624240	clear objective to get there. But this is all exactly the same idea as whether you want to
9624240	9628080	point to Hegel, or you want to point to Marx, whether you want to point to Marcuse, all a new
9628080	9635360	packaging, same operating system, new computer. So that this is all alchemical then for Hegel,
9635360	9641680	and metaphysical is quite clear that it's state alchemical, I don't think I've really established,
9641680	9647120	going into like neo-Marxism and wokeism, other than to point out that Marx believed that the
9647120	9650960	awakening of class consciousness would move the proletariat to advance history to its
9650960	9656000	communistic end. Liberal capitalism would therefore give way to statist socialism and
9656000	9660800	eventually resolve in, as Marcuse had it many years later, a society that presently exists
9660800	9668320	nowhere on earth. In other words, something that isn't derived from which is, in that case, perfected
9668320	9674880	communism. So in other words, communism is supposed to be the end point here. So it's no
9674880	9679360	surprise that the neo-Marxists understood and adopted this ultimately alchemical form as well.
9679360	9682560	So we can turn back to let's look at their literature. We'll find some.
9683440	9686240	Horkheimer and Adorno, we mentioned the dialectic of enlightenment. And by the way,
9686240	9689840	this is the first time the word dialectic appears in that text, other than in the title.
9691200	9695200	They're talking about dialectical thinking, and it's given as the kind of thinking, quote,
9695200	9702400	in which each thing is what it is only by becoming what it is not. That's alchemy. Another good
9702400	9707360	example that this alchemical thinking is still going on appears in Marcuse's repressive tolerance.
9708080	9712160	Tolerance is only truly tolerance by becoming intolerant. We see it also
9712160	9717600	where freedom is only truly free if you limit freedom for certain people, at least.
9718160	9722800	Democracy is only truly democratic when the people with the wrong ideas are disenfranchised,
9722800	9727680	maybe even lose suffrage. Critical thinking is only truly critical thinking when it adopts a
9727680	9733120	critical consciousness or in critical race theory, a space is only desegregated when it is segregated
9733120	9737680	so that it can get away from that structurally deterministic force of racism that's a super
9737680	9742400	structure of society. This is on the rationale that a space can therefore only be deracialized
9742400	9746560	by intentionally racializing it, as we saw in Kimberly Crenshaw's Mapping the Margins,
9746560	9751280	where she advocates that there's a fundamental difference between saying I am black and I am
9751280	9755520	a person who happens to be black. We have to racialize specifically to fight against the
9755520	9759680	imposition of race that's already present. So we have to racialize to deracialize. And again,
9759680	9765360	we see this doublespeak. This is all alchemy. Again, Horkheimer and Adorno, dialectical thinking
9765920	9770880	is the kind of thinking in which each thing is what it is only by becoming what it is not.
9771840	9777200	Lead turns to gold. It's still alchemy. Of course, let's be fair. I mentioned Theodore
9777200	9781920	Adorno in the dialectic of Enlightenment earlier. He criticizes this exactly this idea. I tell you,
9781920	9786960	he turned kind of post-Marxist by this thing 20 years later in 1966. He seeks to recover the
9786960	9792320	dialectic in some new way that merely negates what is and thus opens possibilities for new ideas to
9792320	9796960	bloom from the particulars for nothing in the way. We'll just get rid of everything that's
9796960	9799680	in the way. We won't have a synthetic structure. We're just going to get everything out of the way
9799680	9805520	and then that perennial philosophy might emerge. But this is still alchemical thinking. We see
9805520	9809200	this with the post-modernist Foucault's idea that through criticism, he can expose all the
9809200	9815280	absurdities and thus expand the potentialities of being. That goes the same vibe. Both of these
9815280	9819840	lines appear in the post-Marxist dimension, but we see it in Neo-Marxism as well. Herbert
9819840	9825120	Marcuse's Liberation is the same thing under the Neo-Marxist approach described thusly in his
9825120	9830400	1969 essay on Liberation. Quote, beyond these limits, there's also the space both physical
9830400	9835040	and mental for building a realm of freedom, which is not that of the present. Liberation,
9835040	9840000	also from the liberties of the exploitative order, a liberation which must precede the construction
9840000	9845040	of a free society, one which necessitates a historical break with the past and the present.
9846000	9851760	Of course, the alchemy is still present. It's just worded differently and much less mystically.
9851760	9856640	But in alchemy, this is a key important point. The alchemist must purify himself appropriately,
9856640	9862240	whereas alchemical magic won't work. This is a key hermetic belief. For Herbert Marcuse,
9862240	9867840	we see this actually in the essay on Liberation, which is again 1969, so it's pretty recent.
9867840	9872160	And he writes in shockingly eugenicist terms. We've mentioned this before,
9872160	9877680	what it will require. I'll actually quote here. What is now at stake are the needs themselves?
9878240	9882240	At this stage, the question is no longer how can the individual satisfy his own needs without
9882240	9887360	hurting others, rather how can he satisfy his needs without hurting himself, without reproducing
9887360	9891920	through his aspirations and satisfactions, his dependence on an exploitative apparatus which,
9892480	9898240	in satisfying his needs, perpetuates his servitude. The advent of a free society would be
9898240	9902800	characterized by the fact that the growth of well-being turns into an essentially new quality
9902800	9908480	of life. This qualitative change must occur in the needs and the infrastructure of man,
9908480	9913600	itself a dimension of the infrastructure of society. The new direction, the new institutions,
9913600	9919280	and relationships of production must express the assent of needs and satisfactions very different
9919280	9923760	and even antagonistic to those prevalent and the exploitative societies. Such a change would
9923760	9929760	constitute the Extinctual Basis for Freedom, which the long history of class society has blocked.
9929760	9933920	Freedom would become the environment of an organism which is no longer capable of adapting
9933920	9939360	to the competitive performances required for well-being under domination, no longer capable
9939360	9943440	of tolerating the aggressiveness, brutality, and ugliness of the established way of life.
9943440	9948640	The rebellion would then have to be taken, the rebellion would then have taken root in the very
9948640	9954400	nature, the biology of the individual. Now, on these grounds, the rebels would redefine the
9954400	9959520	objectives and the strategy of the political struggle in which alone the concrete goals of
9959520	9964080	liberation can be determined. You hear Hegel all through this at this point, right? But he's talking
9964080	9968800	about having to literally change the very nature of the biology of the individual so that he's no
9968800	9975280	longer capable of tolerating domination. Maybe you could make him psychopathic. He does note in a
9975280	9980240	footnote that he's not talking about biology as biology, like biology, biology, but rather that
9980240	9984800	he's just making people totally intolerant to the idea of intolerance and of oppression.
9984800	9988720	And look what we're doing to our poor children, making them with their microaggressions and they're
9988720	9993120	so hypersensitive and they freak out and like people say no more politics at work at base camp
9993120	9996960	and they throw themselves on the floor and cry and have tantrums and they have total meltdowns over
9996960	10001200	everything psychologically incapable of dealing with life because they need liberation. They need
10001200	10007840	this perfect liberated world. Ooh, well it's Marcus's project and is it happening? But he's
10007840	10011760	pretty insistent about his biology. Whatever he says about meaning not really meaning biology,
10011760	10016880	let's read a little bit more. Political radicalism thus implies moral radicalism,
10016880	10021200	the emergence of a morality which might precondition man for freedom. So we've got to change
10021200	10026800	morality completely. This radicalism activates the elementary organic foundation of morality in the
10026800	10032640	human being, uh-oh, organic foundation. Prior to all ethical behavior in accordance with specific
10032640	10038000	social standards, prior to all ideological expression, morality is a disposition of the organism,
10038000	10042400	perhaps rooted in the erotic drive to counter aggressiveness, to create and preserve
10042960	10050800	ever greater unities of life. We would then have this side of all values, sorry, we would then have
10050800	10055680	this side of all values, an instinctual foundation for solidarity among human beings. So solidarity I
10055680	10061280	mentioned is key. A solidarity which has been effectively repressed in line with the requirements
10061280	10066160	of class society but which now appears as a precondition for liberty. Solidarity is a precondition
10066160	10071360	for liberty. To the degree to which this foundation is itself historical in the malleability of human
10071360	10076800	nature reaches into the depth of man's instinctual structure, changes in morality may sink down into
10076800	10082400	the biological dimension and modify organic behavior. Once a specific morality is firmly
10082400	10087280	established as a norm of social behavior, it is not only introjected, it operates as a norm of
10087280	10092640	organic behavior. The organism receives and reacts to certain stimuli and ignores and repels others
10092640	10096880	in accord with the introjected morality. Isn't that what's happened to our poor,
10096880	10103280	emotionally crippled college students and adults now? Which is thus promoting or impeding the function
10103280	10108720	of the organism as a living cell in the respective society. In this way, a society constantly recreates
10108720	10114160	a side of consciousness and ideology, patterns of behavior and aspiration as part of the nature
10114160	10119360	of its people. And unless the revolt reaches into this second nature, into these ingrown
10119360	10124640	patterns, social change will remain incomplete and even self-defeating. That's a pretty scary project,
10124640	10129360	man. Just going to say, but we'll finalize with a little bit more from the essay on liberation
10129360	10133920	where he really gets into this biology thing. In the advanced capitalist countries, he writes,
10133920	10138320	the radicalization of the working classes is counteracted by a socially engineered arrest of
10138320	10143200	consciousness. Yeah, of course it is. That's his main thing. And by the development and satisfaction
10143200	10148000	of needs which perpetuate the servitude of the exploited, a vested interest in the existing
10148000	10153200	system is thus fostered in the instinctual structure of the exploited and the rupture with
10153200	10158000	the continuum of repression is a necessary precondition of liberation and it does not occur.
10159040	10163520	It follows that the radical change which is to transform the existing society into a free
10163520	10171040	society must reach into a dimension of the human existence hardly considered in Marxian theory,
10171040	10176320	the biological dimension, in which the vital, imperative needs and satisfactions of man assert
10176320	10180880	themselves. And as much as these needs and satisfaction reproduce, a life in servitude,
10180880	10185920	liberation presupposes change in this biological dimension. That is to say, different instinctual
10185920	10195920	needs, different reactions of the body as well as of the mind. So again, alchemy. Purify oneself
10195920	10202400	sufficiently and engage in the dialectic, the magic process by adopting the critical consciousness.
10202400	10207200	This is what Marcuse demands and what will happen is a liberated utopia will emerge
10207200	10212400	on the other side of everybody doing this by blooming out of the ashes of the existing society
10212480	10218400	once all of its limitations and oppressions are burned away through alphaben, especially
10218400	10224480	alphabenderculture. This is alchemy driven by the dialectic in order to achieve a utopia,
10224480	10230960	gold sprouting from lead, a golden society, a golden age sprouting from an oppressive leaden age.
10230960	10235040	This is the same alchemy and it requires here, literally at the biological level,
10235040	10239600	just like the Soviets requested a new Soviet man, the purification of the self for it to
10239600	10245040	actually work. The adoption of a pure consciousness of the religious, whether it's critical
10245040	10249280	consciousness, class consciousness, racial consciousness, whatever it happens to be.
10250720	10255280	So in essence, this is the Hegelian idea that people will not and cannot be free so long as they
10255280	10260720	are other to the absolute. And in the instant that they genuinely become aware of their own role
10260720	10265760	in manufacturing the absolute and how the absolute understands itself, the absolute will realize
10265760	10269920	itself, history will end in liberation or communism or true freedom, whatever they want to say
10270480	10274000	will emerge in this perfected society that comes out at the end of history.
10274000	10280400	And that's Hegel's historicism upon which all of these stupid ideas are based. It's a Hegelian
10280400	10285440	religion. Of course, we can put all that crap that Marcuse just said, the purification, etc.,
10286000	10290560	much more simply by talking about a contemporary voice. Robin D'Angelo, the author of White
10290560	10297040	Fragility, puts it from her much narrower perch in critical whiteness studies in that 2018 book
10297040	10302560	called White Fragility, that you have to try to be less white. That's the ambition. Try to be less
10302560	10308560	white. That's the solution. Try to be less white. Coca-Cola infamously took this up as a diversity
10308560	10312800	imperative, which results in them facing massive blowback because people saw right through how
10312800	10319920	horrific this is. But for D'Angelo, this is the same as Marcuse, really. The same idea as Marcuse
10320560	10325760	if we were to just purify ourselves of the white supremacist superstructure, get that out of the
10325760	10331280	way a racially liberated world might bloom. If we want to do that, we have to apply the dialectic,
10331280	10337360	but we can only do that if we've already adopted this so-called racial humility, racial stamina,
10338000	10342240	critical race consciousness that she's advocating. We have to be aware of her whiteness and strive
10342240	10347760	to be less white. We have to recognize that there's no such thing as a positive white identity.
10347760	10352960	That's another quote from D'Angelo. Once we purify ourselves, we can therefore apply the
10352960	10359360	dialectic to challenge that white supremacist superstructure by disrupting, dismantling,
10359360	10364400	whatever the words of the subverting. This is applying the flame that heats the world
10364400	10368480	so that the alchemy toward a perfected idea is state and culture, and that's the end of history
10368480	10371840	can be achieved. You hear it in Robin D'Angelo, you hear it in Herbert Marcuse, you see it in
10371920	10378320	Marcuse, or you see it in Hegel, and it's really also in Marcuse. That line is completely
10379040	10383200	drawn at this point, and now we're starting to see that it is a religion with a complete
10383200	10389120	metaphysic, a complete different idea of how the world and God and being and nothing and everything
10389120	10393600	are constituted, a God no longer that is, but a God that becomes by the actions of humans,
10393600	10398480	understanding the problematics, and tearing them away so that the seeds of gold, the alchemy,
10398480	10406080	will arise from that alphabend world. I know Alph Gehoben is the correct past tense there,
10406080	10413440	or something like that, or Alph, I don't know, you can do the German. So the basic idea here
10413440	10417600	is that in the process of creating the other, which is the world, God, which is present in
10417600	10422800	everything, which is kind of a panentheist idea, exists in fragmented form, trapped within the
10423120	10429600	imperfections of the world and the philosophies and religions that arise, the alchemical process
10429600	10435840	is believed the same thing about seeds of gold being trapped in baser materials,
10437120	10441200	is going to be applied here, the alchemical process is to treat those in some kind of an
10441200	10449680	alembic, usually with fire, by spiritually pure alchemists who are in parallel are
10449680	10454480	critically conscious philosophers, in other words by Gnostics, and what will happen is they
10454480	10458160	will free the seeds of gold at a perfected society or perfected ideas and get them to
10458160	10464080	blossom and thus change the base metal and material into gold, or the society into a perfected
10464080	10469040	absolute. The idea will perfect, the absolute will realize itself, the end of history will arrive,
10469040	10475120	and this is the idea behind Hegel's dialectical spiral as Trinity spiral that I've described.
10475280	10483840	Maybe you think I go too far, well let's check again, let's go look at Markuza again, again these
10483840	10488480	themes are going to appear over and over again in the introduction to the second edition of One
10488480	10493760	Dimensional Man, this is not written by Markuza, they describe what Markuza's project is, and he
10493760	10498800	writes, Markuza thought that dialectical philosophy could promote critical thinking, One Dimensional
10498800	10503200	Man is perhaps Markuza's most sustained attempt to present and develop the categories of the
10503200	10509600	dialectic philosophy developed by Hegel and Marx. For Markuza, dialectical thinking involved the
10509600	10514560	ability to abstract one's perceptions and thought from existing forms in order to form more general
10514560	10519920	concepts. Uncritical thinking derives its beliefs, norms, and values from existing thought and social
10519920	10524160	practices, while critical thought seeks alternative modes of thought and behavior from which it
10524160	10530400	creates a standpoint of critique. Such a critical standpoint requires developing what Markuza calls
10530400	10534800	negative thinking, which negates existing forms of thought and reality from the perspective of
10534800	10541520	higher possibilities, spiritually pure alchemy. This practice presupposes the ability to make
10541520	10546320	a distinction between existence and essence, fact and potentiality, and appearance and reality,
10546320	10551520	so these are things that will be dialecticized. Mere existence would be negated in favor of
10551520	10556000	realizing higher potentialities, while norms discovered by reason would be used to criticize
10556000	10561120	and overcome lower forms of thought and social organization. Thus, grasping potentialities for
10561120	10565920	freedom and happiness would make possible the negation of conditions that inhibited individuals
10565920	10571680	full development and realization, in other words, perceiving the possibility of self-determination
10571680	10577120	and constructing one's own needs and values could enable individuals to break with the existing world
10577120	10582640	of thought and behavior. Philosophy was thus to supply the norms for social criticism and the
10582640	10586880	ideal of liberation, which would guide social change and individual self-transformation.
10588160	10594400	And he also notes, critical and dialectical thinking by contrast postulates norms of criticism
10594400	10599680	based on rational potentials for human happiness and freedom, which are used to negate existing
10599680	10604400	states of affairs that oppress individuals and restrict human freedoms and well-being.
10604400	10609520	Dialectical thought thus posits the existence of other realms of ideas, images, and imagination
10609520	10614400	that serves as a potential guide for a social transformation that would realize the unrealized
10614400	10619680	potentialities for a better life. Marcuse believes that great philosophy and art are the locus of
10619680	10624560	these potentialities and critical norms, and he decodes the best products of western culture
10624560	10628880	in this light. So he's performing alchemy on them in order to reach these higher
10628880	10636960	unrealized potentialities for a better life. So for Hegel, where this all comes from, as we just
10636960	10642640	heard, the divine expresses itself in nature. So the seeds of the divine, the perfected ideas,
10643440	10648640	exist in everything, but yet everything is imperfect and must contain its own contradictions.
10649280	10654960	The philosopher, when sufficiently Gnostic, will then be able to apply, in other words,
10654960	10658800	having the right consciousness, will then be able to apply reason,
10658800	10664160	verneumft, as opposed to mere verstaund. We'll come back to verneumft and verstaund in a minute.
10664240	10670400	Via the dialectic, to expose the contradictions and in synthesis get the seeds of the divine
10670400	10676720	to blossom into the world. This gives rise to more perfected ideas, and the process repeats again,
10676720	10682880	with history acting as the alembic, or the world acting as the alembic, and dialectic acting as
10682880	10690960	the fire, and alphabon acting as the reducing process. Occasionally for Hegel, great men of
10690960	10696240	action, this is a key concept that he based off of, for example, Napoleon, are brought to the fore
10696240	10701520	by history to move this process along in lurches. A lot of times they're warlords who kill a lot
10701520	10707200	of people. Napoleon was a Zarkotype, like I said. Lenin, Hitler, Stalin, Mao, Sheikovarra, Castro,
10707200	10712400	Pol Pot, possibly Woodrow Wilson, maybe FDR, and others, certainly looking more historically,
10712400	10718000	Alexander, Genghis Khan, etc. These would all make the list of men of action. And they are used by
10718080	10723520	history, according to Hegel, to move the process of history along, because history has this arching
10723520	10728240	purpose to it, is ultimately to actualize the absolute. And it doesn't matter if these are
10728240	10733840	good guys or bad guys, right? Because if they're bad guys, that's okay. Because sometimes it takes
10733840	10737600	good roads, and sometimes it takes bad roads. That's what we heard from Hegel earlier, and then his own
10737600	10742800	words. So philosophers primarily for Hegel, though, philosophers, he's got a high place for people like
10742800	10748640	him, are meant to move this along in particular. And the tool that they're going to use as reason,
10748640	10757680	which one is perfected, is the absolute. And I say folks very intentionally, who live within the
10757680	10763920	geist, are also helping to move it along, because they help to expose those contradictions in the
10763920	10769040	current state of affairs, which the philosophers will then be able to identify and resolve through
10769120	10773040	proper application of dialectical synthesis. So you see this kind of revolving door that we
10773040	10778640	talked about with the woke between the activists and the scholars here. The faster and the Hegelian
10778640	10782400	thought process, the faster, especially the young Hegelian progressive thought process,
10782400	10786720	the faster this process goes. In other words, the harder the dialectic is pushed, the more the
10786720	10791280	existing society and status quo are torn down and broken, the faster the absolute will be able to
10791280	10796560	realize itself through engagement with its other. And thus the faster everything will be perfected
10796560	10801840	and turned to utopia. So this is, like I said, for Hegel, being a speculative philosopher, he
10801840	10807600	believes he's looking in a mirror to remembering a process of uncovering or recollecting or
10807600	10813520	remembering through speculation, which again, we're going to remember is mysticism, that philosophy
10813520	10818400	perennis, the perennial or eternal philosophy, that is the one true philosophy that all theologies,
10818400	10823120	all religions, all systematic world philosophies are all revealing some part of, but are not
10824080	10829440	properly doing because they're not all convergent into one idea. The alchemical process then is
10829440	10835360	to take the fragmented pieces of this philosophy, philosophy of perennis, and reduce it in the
10835360	10839840	alembic of speculative philosophy down to its essential core. And the tool for doing this is
10839840	10844720	going to be the dialectic, that's the fire really, across the differences and the way that it's
10844720	10851280	actually done is through alphabin. That is the philosophy of perennis, which characterizes the
10851280	10857680	absolute and indicates when realized that the absolute has actualized as the ultimate dialectical
10857680	10863440	synthesis of all ideas, like I said before, everything in the world comes back to one idea.
10863440	10868560	So this is Hegel's speculative idealism is trying to remember the Prisca Theologia,
10868560	10873760	the primordial theology. That was a concept actually that was introduced just to make this
10873760	10880800	point really clear in case it's not yet from Marcellio Fincino or Ficino in the 15th century
10880800	10888240	through the 1400s, I guess then, which is a central concept in hermetic faith. That's alchemy.
10888800	10895040	So it turns out Ficino was actually a priest, but he was also sufficiently hermetic to where he was
10895040	10900960	nearly excommunicated. He was threatened with excommunication for his alchemy, also for his
10900960	10906800	astrology, and maybe for his neoplatanism. So the parallels between Ficino and Hegelianism end up
10906800	10911840	being pretty obvious. Hegel was certainly aware of them because he commented on them in one of his
10911840	10918160	books. You can see this in the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, for example, where they write
10918160	10923680	about Ficino. Ficino saw himself as one member of a venerable sequence of interpreters who added
10923680	10929600	to a store of wisdom that got allowed progressively to unfold. So he's agnostic as well. Each of these
10929600	10933920	Prisci theologi or ancient theologians had his part to play in discovering, documenting,
10933920	10937680	and elaborating the truth contained in the writings of Plato and other ancient sages,
10937680	10944160	a truth to which these sages may not have been fully privy acting as they were as vessels of
10944160	10950960	divine truth. So Ficino, who was an inspiration in some ways to Hegel, was an astrologer and
10950960	10956160	alchemist who was responsible for the translation of hermetic texts, meaning literally the text of
10956240	10964240	Hermes, Trismegistus, along with various Neoplatanus into Latin. And Hegel, writing in the history of
10964240	10970880	philosophy, is aware of him. Technically, he criticizes Ficino's Neoplatanism, but he also
10970880	10979360	adopts his hermetic view and something of his Prisca theologiae. In particular, the view that all
10979360	10985200	faiths and philosophies are manifestations of the one and the same ultimate faith that's being
10985200	10989920	expressed inadequately and incompletely in the world. And so Hegel believes in his systematic
10989920	10996000	philosophy and his reason when it's perfected and becomes the absolute that he has the accurate
10996000	11003280	one true philosophy or faith. This is all being done for Hegel, however, because he sees the absolute
11003280	11007600	as existing throughout time, even though it's becoming absolute throughout time as well,
11008560	11015280	freeing up the philosophy of Parenis from the confines of cloudy nature, which has fragmented
11015280	11019440	it and locked it away in various worldly forms, philosophies and theologies that were constructed
11019440	11023840	by people who only know the part but forgot the whole. So for Hegel, when you know the whole,
11023840	11029040	the parts all make sense. So this gets us, I said we were going to come back to first stand and for
11029040	11035520	Nuunft. These are these two ideas of science and reason that Hegel had. So under the broader
11035520	11040560	heading of knowledge that Wissenschaft in German, which is often translated as science,
11041360	11045760	you actually have two categories for Hegel. One is for stand, which means understanding
11045760	11050480	and translation. And one is for Nuunft, which is translated as reason. So for stand is the lower
11050480	11054240	level. That's just understanding things. It's parallel to traditional theory and the critical
11054240	11058720	and traditional theory break. It's just understanding how things work. It's physics, it's science,
11058720	11063600	it's philosophy. Hegel hated, absolutely hated Isaac Newton, thought he was a total charlatan
11063680	11068240	in a fraud because he was limited to these very observational, empirical, and very rigorous kind
11068240	11074800	of things. He probably also hated his alchemy because Newton was an alchemist too. He died,
11074800	11078640	I think, of mercury poisoning, as a matter of fact, as a result of his alchemy. For Nuunft,
11078640	11086080	however, is reason. Reason's higher. And his articulation of this is actually laying out so
11086080	11092800	called a logic of science or something like this, a system of science. And for stand, understanding
11092800	11098720	is the low level. And at the higher level, you have this kind of critical, dialectical analysis.
11098720	11105040	His systematic philosophy is reason. And for Nuunft is a reason. And when reason is perfected,
11105040	11111840	you have the absolute, which is a perfected, reemerged philosophy of Perennis, which reflects
11111840	11118000	the Prisciatheologia. So this is kind of a very arrogant way of viewing his own philosophy as
11118000	11123200	basically perfect. But it's also a very gnostic way of thinking. For stand, where you're trying
11123200	11128080	to understand the world and do so empirically and logically, that's a low level understanding.
11128080	11134080	There's a higher level of understanding. And you kind of heard Markuza repeatedly appeal to this,
11134080	11137520	a higher level of understanding that's available to the people who have true reason,
11137520	11141840	which is freed up and has a consciousness behind it. And consciousness is the consciousness of the
11141840	11148080	absolute. Pretty intense. We could put this a slightly different way.
11152000	11156320	One of Hegel's tenets that under the purpose of reason is that the particular cannot be
11156320	11160080	understood except in relationship to the whole. We were just talking about that. This is the
11160080	11163840	focus on contradictions, which help you understand that you don't know the whole because if there's
11163840	11170320	a contradiction, you clearly missed something. This means that Hegel's philosophy is ultimately,
11170320	11174000	and these are some magic words I want you to pay attention to, Hegel's philosophy is ultimately
11174000	11180080	holistic rather than reductionist. For stand is reductionist. It's to understand things,
11180080	11186320	break them down, and get it. For nymphed is holistic. And that puts for stand is lowly,
11186320	11192960	while for nymphed is higher. The holistic science. But it also means really that what he calls reason
11192960	11198400	is actually ideology. And this is why all the way down this line, whether it's the young Hegelians,
11198400	11203120	probably Hegel himself, the young Hegelians, the Marxists, the Neo-Marxists, the cultural Marxists,
11204720	11208480	we get weird with the post-modernists, but certainly the woke all seem to think that they
11208480	11214880	have something better, more holistic, superior understanding of the world than everybody else,
11214880	11225120	and that is very Gnostic in nature. Turning back to the marxist.org glossary, looking up the term
11225120	11230640	dialectic, we kind of get confirmation of this. They say their formal thinking often has trouble
11230640	11235760	understanding the causes of events. Something has to be a cause and something else the effect.
11235760	11240160	And people are surprised when they irrigate land and 20 years later, due to salination of the land,
11240160	11245840	silting of the waterways, etc., they have a desert. Dialectics, on the other hand, understands that
11245840	11251120	cause and effect are just one and another side of a whole network of relations, such as we have
11251120	11255600	in an ecosystem. And one thing cannot be changed without changing the whole system. So here's our
11255600	11261200	systemic thinking. Formal thinking often has trouble understanding the causes of events.
11261200	11265920	Something has to be a cause and something else the effect. Sorry, I copied that twice.
11267280	11270800	Changing the whole system is where I wanted to leave off there. I didn't mean to copy it twice,
11270800	11277680	sorry. So dialectic, they write, has its origins in ancient society, both among the Chinese and
11277680	11284400	the Greeks, where thinkers sought to understand nature as a whole and saw that everything is fluid,
11284400	11288640	constantly changing, coming into being and passing away. It was only when the piecemeal method of
11288640	11294240	observing nature in bits and pieces practiced in Western thinking in the 17th and 18th century had
11294240	11298640	accumulated enough positive knowledge for the interconnections and transitions, the genesis
11298640	11303440	of things to become comprehensible, that conditions became ripe for modern dialectics to make its
11303440	11308080	appearance. It was Hegel who was able to sum up this picture of universal interconnection and
11308080	11312880	mutability of all things in a system of logic, which is a foundation of what we today call
11312880	11318480	dialectics. So in other words, all this stupid scientific understanding of things,
11320320	11327120	people, formal thinking, all of this traditional theory is first stunned and it's lowly and it's
11327120	11331760	stupid and people make big mistakes like turning their farmland into desert by not understanding
11331760	11336960	on a higher level. But we have a higher level for Neumft, which is the dialectic,
11336960	11341840	which is Hegel's systematic philosophy. So he names his own systematic philosophy ultimately
11341840	11349200	as logic and reason and that systematic philosophy is, in fact, for him, the higher way of thinking
11349200	11354480	and it is driven by the dialectic. So this is Hegel's metaphysics and it ties into that thread
11354480	11358640	that I said that the operating system is the dialectic. So in one sense, you could follow
11358640	11362960	Marx who said Hegel had the thing standing on its head and turned it back upright and then the
11362960	11367040	Neomarks who said that Marx had kind of got this backwards and had to turn Hegel back upright again.
11367760	11372480	I think it's more accurate, though, to analyze these three groups in a different way and kind of a
11372480	11377760	more dialectical frame, if you will. I think it'd be more accurate to say that Hegel focused on the
11377760	11383920	ideas, which is to say God, the absolute. Marx focused on the state and thus the materials of
11383920	11388800	world or the sun and the Neomarks is focused on the culture, which is the spirit or the
11388800	11397840	gist. So that makes a solid, very clear through line that these people are all the Hegel Marxists,
11397840	11402560	Neomarksists and their woke inheritors are all talking about the same thing with just different
11402560	11407840	aspects being what they believe is the relevant part where you do the alchemical process. For
11407840	11413040	Hegel, if you want to change the world, you focus on the ideas. For Marx, if you want to change the
11413040	11418400	world, you focus on the state and the material conditions. For the Neomarksists, if you want to
11418400	11422800	change the world, you focus on the culture and that translates into the woke as well.
11424400	11429920	Just as an aside, by the way, take a moment to recoil in horror what it implies under Marxism,
11429920	11436240	that a philosophy treats the state like it's Jesus, which in some sense provides salvation and life,
11436240	11440400	but also an ideal model for how to live an ethical life because that's really what's going on under
11440480	11444800	Hegelian statism, especially as it got expressed in Marxism. Because in this way,
11446320	11452000	just recoil in horror by that for a second, just hang on, Jesus as the state. State becomes Jesus.
11454560	11459520	The way the truth and the life become the state. This really is how Hegel thought about
11459520	11464960	the state, by the way. We'll come back to this in a few moments. So in this way of thinking,
11464960	11469200	just summing up the metaphysics, if I can a little bit, Hegel remains speculative,
11469200	11475200	which means mystical, trying to apply the dialectic to ideas. Marx frees him from his mystical shell,
11475200	11479280	makes the dialectic into dialectical materialism, and seeks to exploit the contradictions of
11479280	11484560	material life by raising class consciousness in the people who experience it. And the Neomarksists
11484560	11489520	shift that whole project to alphabend or coulter, the dialectical abolishment or
11489520	11495840	transformation of culture and working in the geist. So the current woke project is primarily
11495840	11502400	an effort of constant multi-dimensional alphabend or culture, cultural warfare
11502400	11508960	of the dialectical leftist motif. Thus it's no surprise that we are now currently embroiled
11508960	11515600	in a totalizing international culture war. And it's also very easy to see who the antagonists are
11515600	11525040	and how they proceed. And the way that they proceed is through this culture war, this alphabender
11525040	11532080	culture tear down the existing culture to cause problems. It's also very easy to see this whole
11532080	11538080	project in all three of these forms as being a religion. In fact, three species or three
11538080	11543440	denominations of one religion or maybe four denominations of one religion. The Judeo-Christian
11543440	11547600	model is not a terrible metaphor, but I don't want you to get me wrong and take this all too
11547600	11551520	literally. I'm just using a comparison. I don't want to upset any of my Christian friends here.
11551520	11554880	I want to get people to think. I want to spur the thinking. I want to use a historical
11554880	11560480	development of Christianity in this regard. I'm not comparing the values or the ethics involved.
11560480	11564080	I'm not comparing the value. I'm not comparing the truth. I'm just using it as a comparison
11564080	11568560	point so people understand. But in this sense, one, you could almost think of Hegel himself
11568560	11573760	as being kind of Judaic. And he's the one that's establishing and making covenant with,
11573760	11578800	documenting this new absolute deity. Marx then falls into the role of the early pre-Polyan
11578800	11583440	Christians who have brought this faith into a new era of practicality, but whose reach is
11583440	11588640	relatively limited. And the Neo-Marxists, by turning to Alphabander Coulter down through the
11588640	11594000	woke, would be like the Pauline evangelists whose reach is virtually unlimited. And that's
11594000	11597840	sort of the religious structure of this religion in terms of how it comes out practically.
11599600	11605760	Hegel, the Judaic faith is very exclusive. The kind of pre-Polyan Christian approach is also
11605760	11613120	quite limited in terms of its reach, but evangelistic Christianity is billions in global
11613440	11622080	rapidly expansive. And this Pauline demand to evangelize is indicative of what you see in
11622080	11627760	the Neo-Marxists and the evangelists by moving the entire project into the site of Geist.
11628560	11634160	So rather than working within the idea as the deity, or working within the material world
11634160	11638720	as the sun, they instead turn to the Geist. In other words, they're working through what Hegel
11638720	11644240	would conceive of as the Holy Spirit, and that the Spirit is what moves the world. And good night
11644240	11648800	are they ever succeeding at moving the world with it. Just a metaphor, though. Don't get too
11648800	11654320	caught up in that. In all three cases, though, the basic underlying faith is identical, present,
11654320	11658560	largely constant, and that faith is based on Hegel's metaphysics, which is ultimately a
11658560	11664560	metaphysics based on societal alchemy that's meant to create some new world that's perfected
11664560	11670560	and utopian. And this leaves it open to megalomaniacs, who throughout history have come up and picked
11670560	11676480	up these ideas, whether Hitler, whether Stalin, whether Lenin, whether Mao, we could name more,
11676480	11680400	who pick up these ideas and think that their vision of the right side of history can be
11680400	11684960	implemented under their rule. And the woke, although they don't have this charismatic
11684960	11690080	man of action behind them right now as it's phrased in Hegel, are doing the same thing,
11690080	11696160	which is why I've called it Leninism 4.0 in the past. So let's step back now. Let's kind of change
11696160	11701520	gears and start heading toward a very long wrap up to this. We've got a ways to go still. We're
11701520	11709040	over three hours. It's amazing. Step back to this whole line of broadly Hegelian thought,
11709040	11712720	there are lots of consequences. Let's talk about the consequences of this line of thinking.
11712720	11719120	So one is necessity and urgency to the dialectic. If you really believe that the utopia is brought
11719120	11725200	about faster by the process of the dialectic, you have to do this hard and fast as hard and
11725200	11729680	fast as possible. This is what the progressives drive at. The more vigorously the dialectic
11729680	11734320	is applied, the faster we get to utopia that exists at the end of history. So everybody
11734320	11740160	whom resists must somehow be evil because they resist the idea of utopia and they drag humanity's
11740160	11745680	feats, they drag history's feet. And in the whole time that is happening, they maintain all of these
11745680	11752240	oppressions of the imperfected society. That's evil. So you're going to see urgency. You're going
11752240	11757200	to see demands for conformity. You're going to see demands for collectivism as a result. We're
11757200	11760960	also going to see statism and I'm going to have to quote Hegel quite a bit, but you already saw
11760960	11764080	all these seeds of statism. I just haven't really backed them up, but I really want to convince
11764080	11768960	you that Hegel was a statist, so it's no surprise that Marxism becomes statist. The neo-Marxism
11768960	11774080	is totally totalitarian and the wokeism inherits both statism and totalitarianism because
11774080	11779280	Hegel's philosophy is ultimately profoundly statist. Remember that the state is a divine
11779280	11784800	idea as expressed on earth is pretty statist. So in the philosophy of Hegel writes, quote,
11784800	11790880	the state is absolutely rational in as much as it is the actuality of the substantial will
11790880	11796240	which it possesses in the particular self-consciousness once that consciousness has been raised to
11796240	11801520	consciousness of its universality. That's a complicated way of saying that basically once
11801520	11807600	consciousness becomes kind of critically aware, then you have the state being absolutely
11807600	11814080	rational and it's going to be a perfected state like I keep saying. This substantial unity Hegel
11814080	11821680	writes is an absolute unmoved end in itself in which freedom comes into its supreme right.
11822400	11826320	On the other hand, this final end has supreme right against the individual
11826400	11833520	who's supreme duty is to be a member of the state. So total statism under Hegelian thought,
11833520	11840080	and you see this exact mentality all the way down that whole line, young Hegelian, Marxist,
11840080	11847280	neo-Marxist, woke. What else did Hegel say? Same in philosophy of right, he says, the state is
11847280	11854160	the actuality of the ethical idea. It is the ethical mind qua, the substantial will, manifest and
11854160	11859600	revealed to itself, knowing and thinking itself, accomplishing what it knows and insofar as it
11859600	11866560	knows it. This sets aside, of course, I mean this more statism obviously, this sets aside,
11866560	11870640	of course, is a much more famous declaration in the philosophy of history which I just referenced,
11870640	11875680	for truth is the unity of the universal and subjective will and the universal is to be
11875680	11881440	found in the state and its laws, its universal and rational arguments. The state is a divine idea
11881440	11887440	as it exists on earth. We have in it, therefore, the object of history in a more definite shape
11887440	11893840	than before and in which freedom obtains objectivity and lives in the enjoyment of this
11893840	11900240	objectivity. So this is why they think freedom comes from the state in Hegelian leftism.
11901280	11908080	And remember, the state has the supreme right against the individual whose supreme duty is
11908080	11913920	to be a member of the state. This is Hegelian statism. So all of his theosophy aside, all of
11913920	11917680	his metaphysical side, all of this has political consequences and free societies like the United
11917680	11922800	States, especially any free society, the United States in particular, that proceeds from a Lockean
11922800	11928320	or then derived Jeffersonian framework, we believe that rights precede the state. Our rights were
11928320	11935840	endowed by a creator. They are inalienable. In a Hegelian framework, this is not how it works. The
11935840	11941280	individual is totally to be subsumed by the state. It has a supreme right against it and the
11941280	11946800	individual has a complete duty to the state, total statism, total collectivism. So rights are then
11946800	11952720	replaced by privileges to be granted by the state. This is a completely different political model.
11954240	11959680	Rights endowed by the creator meets the antithesis of privileges granted by the state.
11960480	11964080	The connection to what's going on in the Woke ideology today here cannot be missed,
11964080	11967840	especially in the now famous declaration in Critical Race Theory and Introduction
11967840	11973520	that I've repeatedly quoted from page 23 in my edition, first edition. Critical Race Theos
11973520	11979520	are highly suspicious of another liberal mainstay, namely rights. Of course they are. And they're
11979520	11983600	simultaneously obsessed with privilege and how the system, which is a manifestation of the idea
11983600	11988880	state in the culture or geist, creates and thus bestows privilege. Privilege is something that's
11988880	11992720	granted by the state. They're obsessed with the idea of privilege. They're obsessed with who has
11992720	11996960	privilege and how that's unfair because the state itself is unfair because the entire structure
11996960	12002240	of the idea state and culture are incorrect. And so they agitate culture knowing that that's where
12002240	12007520	you have the most drive to change the entire thing, to reorganize who has privilege. That's
12007520	12010400	why they're so obsessed with privilege. That's why they want people to check their privilege. That's
12010400	12014240	why they want to criticize privilege. That's why they're constantly harping on privilege,
12014240	12017920	because privilege is something that comes down from the state and they want to reorganize everything.
12018000	12022880	So the privilege gets reorganized so that it operates according to their ideology,
12022880	12027600	their worldview. Another consequence of the Higellian thought, as I've just mentioned a couple
12027600	12031520	times, is collectivism therefore. Because when the ideas are perfected, and this is a little bit of
12031520	12035520	a philosophical point, everybody must have the same ideas because they're perfect. And all the
12035520	12039680	contradictions that lead to different ideas must have been synthesized. Now think about it. If
12039680	12043040	anybody has different ideas, that's the site of contradictions. If your idea and my idea are
12043040	12047360	different, we now have a dialectic between us. So that means it's not perfectly synthesized.
12047360	12051920	So we don't have the perfect idea, therefore the absolute has not recognized itself unless we
12051920	12057040	all have the same idea. There can be no cognitive liberty in the perfected state. We have to have
12057040	12062880	total collectivism. We don't all have to even be the same. We have to think the same. And this is
12062880	12068240	going to happen by bringing that state, by all subsuming our will to the state, giving over our
12068240	12073760	will, our duty to the state entirely. So now we're a collectivist organization. So collectivism
12073760	12078480	is massively, I don't think, of course, the Hegelian thought created collectivism. Collectivism
12078480	12083920	precedes it, but this is an amplification of it to a traumatic degree with a powerful collectivist
12083920	12089360	metaphysic underneath it. And this, of course, collectivism leads people who take it up to try
12089360	12094400	to force a situation because they believe that when there's total conformity to their totalizing
12094400	12101760	ideology, and that's collectively maintained, then we're now near or at the point of the absolute
12101760	12107520	realizing itself. We're now at the perfected point, and the utopia is imminent. Because we're all part
12107520	12111680	of the dialectical process that's moving history forward, and we're all in it together. We're all
12111680	12117440	in it together, right? That's collectivism. And of course, anybody who has a different idea becomes
12117440	12125040	both a problem, but also proof that the absolute hasn't realized itself, because the ideas haven't
12125040	12129040	been perfected. So that person becomes a site, somebody with a different idea, somebody with
12129040	12134160	their own thoughts, with cognitive freedom becomes a site where the dialectic is continuing to play
12134160	12138800	out. But that means it's not done playing out. So the utopia is not here. So somebody with different
12138800	12144400	thoughts is preventing the emergence of the utopia, and probably they're just being stubborn. And you
12144400	12150000	can see where the frustration starts to rise and where people get shot. People who don't want to
12150000	12155920	get on board with this, especially once some psychopath or megalomaniacal man of action have
12155920	12162320	taken control and power, which is totally a weakness of this ideology because their man of
12162320	12166560	action is always being looked for, who's going to move this through. That's going to be perceived
12166560	12171760	from within this logic as being against the realization of utopia, problematic, and in need
12171760	12177760	of elimination, or at least of excommunication or silencing or complete marginalization.
12178800	12184320	And that's exactly what we see. That's cancel culture. And that's exactly what we saw with
12184320	12188720	much more horrific manifestations under people like Lenin and Stalin and Mao, etc.
12189760	12195600	Che Guevara, Fidel, you know, you name them. And this is another thing I just mentioned,
12195600	12202400	you know, these guys, this kind of a mentality, this Gaelian magic is wide open to psychopaths
12202400	12206400	and other megalomaniacs who think that they have, and they have the charisma to pull it off a little
12206400	12212240	bit, and the total ruthlessness to force it, they think they have the vision. They've studied the
12212240	12216640	theory, and they know what it is. So they have the vision and the capacity to decide what the
12216640	12220720	right side of history actually is. And it's going to strangely conform to their freaking pathologies,
12220720	12226000	of course, and they're going to install a pathocracy, a pathological government that basically
12226000	12230800	tries to make their life like everybody's working for them. And they have the ability to usher that
12230800	12237440	in at whatever costs. This is going to happen again and again under a Gaelian framework. This is why
12237440	12242880	the left right now is utterly catastrophic, and it keeps generating these catastrophic movements.
12243600	12249200	Hegel's man of action is meant to come in in the attempt to fulfill history. History is using
12249200	12254400	him. He's not even his own agency. History is using the man of action to progress the dialectic,
12254400	12261920	to progress history. As critical race theory has it, right? The dialect, and so the dialectic
12261920	12268800	progresses, right? And if he fails in his mission to fulfill history, that still fits into the same
12268800	12274320	mold. History still progresses. If he doesn't fulfill history, history progresses. He win-win.
12274320	12277920	So he's likely to gain significant support from the dialectical left who believes in this kind of
12277920	12285600	faith. But this leads into these kind of mentalities that we keep hearing, these tropes. For example,
12285600	12290880	real communism has never been tried, because every attempt so far was actually just a case where it
12290880	12296240	wasn't real communism. People forwarded some new synthetic idea that wasn't the totally synthetic
12296240	12301760	perfected idea, and the contradictions that they had in their attempt were revealed to them through
12301760	12306960	the unfolding process of history, which might be tens or hundreds of millions of dead people,
12306960	12312080	or world wars. World War I and World War II are both the results of this. For example,
12312640	12318160	all of the communist failures are results of this. Hitler is a result of this. All of this is a result
12318160	12325600	of a Hegelian dialectic being taken up as a faith. So they say real communism hasn't been tried,
12326240	12330720	because it will only be tried or only will have occurred after the absolute realizes itself,
12330720	12335360	not before. And so everything up to that point, no matter how bad, remember good roads and bad
12335360	12340000	roads, is how history progresses, was just the part of the process of making our way there.
12341120	12346800	So thesis, communism is the way. Antithesis, 100 million people dead. Synthesis, neo-Marxism,
12346800	12350800	let's shift it to culture. Let's get out of material and shift to geist. It'll work this time.
12352560	12358240	Furthermore, all these mass deaths that we see through these awful Hegelian projects,
12358880	12364400	these people are just martyrs of history. They're not a tragedy. They're a victory.
12365360	12371120	100 million dead? Good. That's the view, because history used them. They're martyrs,
12371120	12375600	but history used them to reveal the contradictions and the ideas that are being forwarded in that age,
12375600	12379920	so they're not really a loss. They were revealing those contradictions as history needed them to.
12379920	12383920	History used them and discarded them, just as it does men of action.
12384880	12389920	So indeed, the 100 million dead are a benefit under this kind of a worldview. History, under
12389920	12395200	Hegel's philosophy, under his historicism, which was praised by Engels, uses people for its purpose
12395200	12400000	and then discards them, so 100 million dead are just part of that process. Ends justify the means,
12400080	12403360	after all. We keep hearing these things, they're ends in and of themselves.
12404640	12408880	As Hegel had it then, the spirit of the time-commanded movement, the absolute marches through
12408880	12413920	history by good roads and bad ones, so long as it continues marching, 100 million dead is just
12413920	12419200	another road, just another part of the process. It's all progress, no matter how bad it is.
12420080	12422560	So let's ratchet down if you're not just from that horror show.
12424720	12428800	One more example, and then we'll talk about what to do about it to wrap up,
12428800	12432640	getting close to the four-hour mark. People wouldn't maybe expect is another consequence
12432640	12436880	of the Hegelian thought is the interfaith movement. We're ratcheting way down from 100 million dead.
12437760	12441520	The interfaith movement, this is actually another aspect of Hegel's philosophy,
12442240	12447360	or the results of it, because of that Priscotheologia and the philosophy of Perennis that he's after.
12447360	12451200	Interfaith is the attempt to bring all the various faiths and maybe philosophies together.
12451760	12455840	You can think of the UU Church, the United Universalists, for example,
12455920	12460400	and extract from them what was originally there, that Priscotheologia, before it became
12460400	12465360	corrupted and worldly, or to identify within them the various aspects reflected of the philosophy
12465360	12470080	of Perennis that is the perennial philosophy that all of them are just badly simulating in the
12470080	12477680	simulation and simulacris sense of John Baudrillard. So for Marx, state atheism and his view of
12477680	12482640	materialism would do, and our present incarnation of all this nonsense, which is woke, as with the
12482640	12488880	others before, a highly refined, mostly nonsensical vision of social justice, is something to do with
12488880	12495920	the philosophy of Perennis. Equity becomes the updated vision of communism under this social
12495920	12502080	justice model. Public-private partnerships become the vehicle, a supernational superstate that
12502080	12510960	replaces a state as nation-state. So we have our equity geist, we have our supernational state
12510960	12515520	in public-private partnerships. And the faith traditions of the world all cheer this on by
12515520	12520080	subverting their own beliefs to the synthetic idea of social justice. So the Christians are
12520080	12524000	social justice and saying it in Christianese. The Muslims are social justice and saying it in
12524000	12528960	Islamese. The Buddhists are social justice and saying it in Buddhistese. And everybody's actually
12528960	12532480	not preaching their own or talking about their own faith or their own philosophy or their own
12532480	12538480	tradition. They're all just using that as kind of parasitically, using that to forward one different
12538480	12543600	faith, which is social justice. And a socially just world is the new name for the project
12543600	12547840	that will lead the absolute to realize itself and actualize. This is all still Hegelian
12547840	12553120	metaphysical faith. So I hope I've now established my two big takeaways and we can turn to what we
12553120	12558000	might do with this information. One, we should understand that the operating system of the left,
12558000	12562960	and I devoted two hours to this, so I hope you got the point, is in fact the Hegelian dialectic.
12563840	12567600	Though it comes in different forms and with different focuses, largely because the dialectic
12567600	12572880	being its main operating system applies to itself and concentrates and changes it. So from
12572880	12579200	Hegel's very idealistic view to Marxist dialectical materialist view to the neo-Marxist very cultural
12579200	12585920	alphabanderic culture view to the woke, you know, kaleidoscope of identity politics that we have
12585920	12593120	today. In that sense, what we see as an underlying metaphysics and underlying tool, it's ultimately
12593120	12599040	religious and is being driven by this process, this dialectical process that is ultimately
12599040	12605520	alchemical in nature. Understanding this thing is absolutely crucial to understanding what's
12605520	12610240	going on now and the currents of leftist thought since at least the 1830s and maybe earlier,
12610240	12613680	and it should truly be seen as a religious movement. By the way, of course, I mentioned the
12613680	12620960	dialectic with the tool of alphabon at its core is ultimately what drives the whole thing. So the
12620960	12627040	methodological undercurrent of the entire leftist project over the same two-century time frame
12627040	12635760	is dialectic driven by alphabon, abolish, destroy, undermine, while trying to pull out and blossom
12635760	12642080	the seed of gold within it. So if we turn to Ben Shapiro's, now he's been talking a lot about this
12642080	12646880	trichotomy in society of leftists. I'm going to talk about what to do about it. Leftist liberals
12646880	12651440	and conservatives. One thing we can take away from this mentality already is that liberals
12651440	12656160	and conservatives in our society and free societies form a more natural and sensible
12656160	12661280	allyship for maintaining freedom than do leftists and liberals, though liberals don't seem to realize
12661280	12665680	this yet. So liberals really should be allying with conservatives, not on conservative policy goals,
12665680	12672080	but on the maintenance of a world order that is not this insane Hegelian leftism that's likely to
12672080	12676160	lead to the same kinds of catastrophes it keeps leading to over and over again, because alchemy
12676160	12682960	is not real and you can't build a positive thing out of negation constantly. In one sense, we could
12682960	12687760	say then, this is another thing I want to write eventually, the West could be said to have three
12687760	12691520	gods. I want to write an essay called The Three Gods of the West exploring this idea. In some
12691520	12695200	broad sense, these would be the Judeo-Christian God, which would be roughly for the conservatives,
12695200	12701120	we don't have to be too, this is again just kind of tin potting the ideas, but Judeo-Christian God,
12701120	12706080	roughly for the conservatives, secularized, it's not exactly Spinozin, but Spinozin,
12706080	12710800	Lockean God, I know Locke was a Christian calm down, that it's kind of characterized in what you
12710800	12714960	see in the Jeffersonian Bible or the Jefferson Bible where we carved out all of the mysticism and
12714960	12720720	the magic and whatever else is the miracles with a razor knife early in the nation's founding.
12720720	12725760	It was reflecting those ideals, the very Jeffersonian liberal ideals, and that's for the liberals. So
12725760	12733520	we have this kind of Lockean, Spinozin, Jeffersonian freedom deity for the liberals versus Judeo-Christian
12733520	12738560	God for the conservatives. And then we have the Hegelian absolute as for the leftists,
12738560	12742880	which is a fundamentally different thing that's inimical to the underlying philosophical foundations
12742880	12747360	shared by the conservatives and the liberals. So liberals and conservatives here, what I'm saying,
12748080	12752720	once we understand what this leftism, this Hegelian faith really is, liberals and conservatives,
12752720	12757440	as we use it kind of in the, I'm saying, Ben Shapiro's trichotomy, leftist liberals and
12757440	12762720	conservatives, it's not perfect. I get it, I know, I could criticize the language, but it's
12762720	12768240	useful for how we're thinking. Liberals and conservatives in that sense have something
12768240	12774320	deeply in common, whereas the Hegelian leftists have something deeply different that really
12774320	12780240	should be horrifying. So there is actually a natural allyship between the liberals and
12780240	12783840	conservatives. We could talk about it theologically if you want. My three guys of the west would
12783840	12792000	argue, for example, that this Judeo-Christian conservative God, just again, Tempot explanation
12792000	12798080	and this kind of Jeffersonian liberal God have as presuppositions a God that is,
12799040	12805840	in the God is Alpha and Omega, I am the I am, whereas Hegel has this leftism, has this God
12805840	12811520	that becomes through their activism, justifying, you know, ends justify the means and so on.
12812080	12817120	So summarizing that idea, again, very briefly, leftist conservatives with their two so-called
12817120	12820800	deities as representatives approach the divine with humility. That's what's something they
12820800	12826080	have in common. They're humble before something bigger than we are. That's incomprehensible
12826080	12831120	to us. It's ultimately well beyond us, whereas leftists don't have this with their Hegelian
12831120	12837760	deity and their faith and the Hegelian faith behind them that's fueled up in praxis. They
12837760	12842160	actually approach what they believe is the divine with arrogance, because their goal is to bring
12842160	12848240	their own vision into being and make it lord through their machinations and activism. This is
12848240	12853200	the reason that a lot of the kind of far far right conservative Christians identify it with
12853200	12859680	Luciferianism or Satanism, because that's exactly the kind of thing that those ideas are supposed
12859680	12865760	to reflect. It is a very arrogant belief, though, that you're going to bring about the
12865760	12871520	actualization of God through your activism and compared to the humility of whether it's
12872400	12877680	God the father of the Judeo-Christian tradition or whether it's the world as it is
12879040	12884560	beyond and bigger than us with all that humility that's a complete departure. So liberals and
12884560	12887600	conservatives should be teaming up against leftists. That's one thing to understand from
12887600	12894960	understanding what's going on here. So ultimately, my goal here has been to make clear what's going
12894960	12900240	on with the woke left and most of the left over the last 200 years, old left, new left, woke left,
12900960	12904880	which exists in a single current. That's what I'm trying to argue, a single current in which Marx
12904880	12914000	is just one species, Lenin, Stalin, Mao. These are woke precursors. Wokeness is Leninism 4.0,
12914080	12920080	as I've argued elsewhere. Bio-Leninism is other people have argued kind of taking a page out of
12920080	12925040	Foucault by saying that when you have scientific technocracy involved, technocratic elements
12925040	12930240	where it's bio-something, and it's Leninism driven through technocratic means of bio-Leninism.
12930240	12935200	These are all just threads in the same line of thought. There's all one religion, and that
12935200	12940080	religion is comprehensible, and it's defeasible when it's understood because it's intrinsically weak.
12940640	12944720	It consistently fails to have the evidence, it doesn't have the argument, and it completely
12944720	12949440	lacks the moral high ground once you understand what it is. And faith is ultimately the Hegelian
12949440	12956320	dialectical faith, which is ultimately alchemical in nature, hermetic in nature, as I've been
12956320	12961520	arguing on Twitter and people get pissed off at me when I do. So one more thing, what can we do
12961520	12966000	with this idea that I've summarized is that to beat the dialectical left requires understanding
12966000	12971200	that it is dialectical, and then not getting dragged into the dialectic. It seeks to make
12971200	12976400	something out of nothing, so you don't play along with it. You don't go along, you don't believe
12976400	12980720	that you can make something out of nothing, or that you can create positive or success out of
12980720	12984720	negation. That's absolutely ridiculous where you have Markuza arguing that the negative thinking
12984720	12991680	leads to positive. None of this will work. They literally think that the golden era is inside
12991680	12996720	of a shell of oppression. If we just rip all the oppression off, the golden era will blossom out.
12996720	13000800	This doesn't work. So what do you have to do practically as an individual or an institution
13000800	13004720	is you have to avoid the dialectic. You have to stay out of it. I did a whole podcast on my other
13005280	13010480	podcast. I have private contributors only where I compared it to alligators or crocodiles that
13010480	13014400	drag you under the water and roll you. They throw out a dialectical bid. You need to learn to
13014400	13019760	recognize these, and you learn to not participate. If you cave in, you bend the knee, you give in,
13020480	13025200	you grant their presuppositions, you try to argue back or whatever, they drag you into the mud.
13025200	13030560	Your options then are to mock it if that's appropriate and to get kind of funny about it,
13030560	13036160	or to, as I've argued in yet another podcast, to engage their Mott and Bailey as it's called
13036160	13040400	rhetorical strategy, steal their Mott, which means make the core of their argument, their
13040400	13045680	kernel, the truth of their argument better than they can, and then bomb the Bailey, which is to
13045680	13050640	say destroy their activist agenda. If we put it in the language of this hermetic alchemical thing,
13050640	13053600	you're going to go in and you're going to say, yeah, you're right. Okay, it turned out there is a
13053600	13058160	little nugget of gold inside your big lump of lead, and I'm going to take the gold out for you.
13058160	13061440	That's going to be mine, and I'm going to point out why everything else you have is lead and know
13061440	13067280	you're not going to turn that into gold. Steal the Mott, bomb the Bailey. Those are your only
13067280	13072240	things you can do. You have to find other modes of engagement like mockery or this very kind of
13072240	13077680	savvy steal the Mott, bomb the Bailey, or you have to just stand in your principles. A little
13077680	13082720	bit of chauvinism won't hurt too much, refusing to bend the knee, refusing to participate,
13085440	13090080	forcing them to play on neutral terms, make them define their terms, etc., so that you can stay out
13090080	13094880	of their dialectic word games and so on. But also, you have to learn to start seeing and
13094880	13098640	anticipating their moves and manipulations, which you can do once you understand that they are
13098640	13103680	operating from a dialectical frame and under the belief that they're saving the world,
13103680	13110080	that they're bringing about a utopia through their actions. So, remember, don't fall for it.
13110640	13117440	Their negative, alphabin, demolish, deconstruct, disrupt, dismantle process
13118320	13128560	cannot create. It can only destroy or spend. Harvard University is my favorite example
13128640	13134160	of this right now. I just saw a thing on Twitter talking about how 40% of its professors are worried
13134160	13139680	that its brand is losing status. Yeah, it is massively. It's a freaking clown college. Harvard
13139680	13145360	University is almost 400 years old. It's burned through something like 380 years or something
13145360	13152400	like this of excellent top notch, top grade branding in just a few years by taking all this
13152400	13158400	woke crap on. It only took it like four or five years, but really just the last year,
13158400	13164240	to burn down 400 years. And all it did was enable a few people to grift and a few ideas to get pushed
13164240	13169440	out with imprimatur that the imprimatur is going to collapse under its own way. This is the same.
13169440	13173360	All the communists or all of history, all of the neo-Marxists, all history, all of them,
13173360	13178400	they all do this. They infiltrate some, whether it's an economic institution,
13178400	13183440	whether it's a cultural institution, they infiltrate it, they spend, spend, spend, spend,
13183440	13187600	spend, and eventually they burn the thing to the ground because they don't produce anything. And
13187600	13191120	they have to move on to some new thing to get other people to produce for them because you
13191120	13197520	can't create through a negation process. Alf Haven doesn't make. Critical theory doesn't build.
13197520	13201440	Critical theory doesn't even understand. It has no obligation to understand. It has only the
13201440	13208160	obligation for Alf Haven to cooter. It only has the obligation to tear down. So if you're in the
13208240	13213520	position where you're looking at this woke nonsense or anything related to it, think twice.
13213520	13218080	You're not going to do better in your organization. Harvard University burned through its branding.
13218080	13222720	In a couple of years, you're not going to do better. Coca-Cola and the Department of Backoff,
13222720	13227760	after they tried to say B less white, Disney's starting to fold. Everything is big. It doesn't
13227760	13231840	matter how big they are. The federal government of the United States is a laughing stock right now
13231840	13235920	because they're trying to force this crap both in the critical race theory direction and the
13235920	13243120	trans direction. Are you out of your mind? Don't take it up. It will burn you to the ground so fast
13243120	13249120	and it will use you to advance its interests, to grift a little bit, to push its narrative a little
13249120	13255120	bit further and burn all of your hard-earned cultural, social, and economic capital to the
13255120	13259520	ground because it can't build. That's all it does. Constant negativity in pursuit of the
13259520	13264720	magical emergence of the great or the good after all the negative is so-called destroyed
13264720	13270480	is not going to create good. That's not how it works. Building the good takes actual work.
13270480	13273840	You actually have to know what you're doing. You actually have to take some risks. You actually
13273840	13278960	have to do some hard things. Good must be built up and then it must be maintained and defended
13278960	13286000	and the dialectic cannot do this. It is a process of negating, not building. It can only destroy
13286000	13291920	and spend. It's central article of faith which is that hermetic alchemical belief that things
13291920	13297200	will purify and perfect is ultimately wrong. It's bad theory. Bad theory put into practice
13297200	13303680	makes bad results. So you need to understand that the goal of the dialectic is not in fact
13303680	13308480	to create at all. So this is why you shouldn't adopt it. If you understand this as a religion,
13308480	13314160	you understand its goal is to win. Its goal is to take over, to gain dominance. We heard that from
13314160	13321680	them themselves. This is why the dialectical left is and always has been power obsessed
13321680	13326960	and seeks to seize the means of the idea, economic, cultural, linguistic, discursive,
13326960	13332880	or whatever production in society. Its objective is not understanding its operational success.
13332880	13338960	Its goal is not to create or to build. It is to win, to seize power and to foist as much of its
13338960	13344800	agenda on the world as it can before it burns out. So to close, I'm going to do something quite
13344800	13348720	controversial. I'm going to quote from a figure you're not allowed to drag into these kinds of
13348720	13355360	things named George Soros in his 1992 book called The Alchemy of Finance. He writes the following,
13355360	13360880	I think you'll see the Hegel in this. Or if you're a scholar of Horkheimer, you'll see the critical
13360880	13366640	versus traditional theory thing in this. He writes, the scientific method seeks to understand things
13366640	13372720	as they are while alchemy seeks to bring about a desired state of affairs. To put it another way,
13372720	13380400	the primary objective of science is truth, that of alchemy operational success. That's George Soros
13381040	13385360	writing in a book about finance where he explained basically how he was able to
13385360	13391200	crash and short the pound sterling. He didn't build the British economy. He damaged the British
13391200	13399280	economy and grifted off of it. Same process. Alchemy is the method. His tool is called reflexivity.
13399280	13404560	If you want to look up what that is, we're not going to get into that whole second side discussion.
13406480	13412240	But this is the fundamental difference then between Hegelian alchemy and liberalism or even
13412240	13419440	conservatism. And it's the same difference that you see in the Neo-Marxist critical theorists
13419440	13424080	that they put between traditional and critical theory. I could reread Soros' statement that way.
13425840	13430160	The traditional theory seeks to understand things as they are while critical theory
13430160	13434000	seeks to bring about a desired state of affairs. To put it another way, the primary objective
13434000	13440080	of traditional theory is truth, that of critical theory operational success. We could probably say
13440080	13444880	this in Hegelian language. For Stan to seek to understand things as they are,
13444960	13449120	well, Vernunft seeks to bring about a desired state of affairs. To put it another way,
13449120	13455840	the primary objective of Verstand is truth, that of Vernunft is operational success.
13457440	13462240	This is the same thing that Marx dragged up then in the difference between Wiesen-Schacht
13462240	13468480	and Wiesen-Schacht-Lichter-Sozialism. I can't say German. We're just going to
13468480	13474000	Sozialism based on his critical philosophy. So critical philosophy becomes the thing here.
13474000	13477280	We could put this in. Science seeks to understand things as they are,
13477280	13480640	while critical philosophy seeks to bring about a desired state of affairs.
13481920	13485600	The other two, the philosophers, have only sought to understand a world. The point is to
13485600	13490160	change it. To put it another way, the primary objective of critical philosophy is, or sorry,
13490160	13495040	the primary objective of science is truth, that of critical philosophy, operational success.
13496240	13499840	Again, it's the same thing as Hegel saw between Verstand and Vernunft,
13500640	13505280	understanding and reason, which meant the application of a systematic philosophy to
13505280	13508960	perfect the ideas of the world according to his own program and thought. Finally,
13509520	13517280	yet tremendous length. I think we're just closing up on four hours. I have discussed Hegel. As I
13517280	13523200	told you I would, Hegel's relevance to the woke. My claim that the woke is ultimately a hermetic,
13523200	13532640	meaning alchemical, religion, based in Hegelian philosophy, rooted in the dialectical process.
13533200	13540000	Proceeding by the by the neo-Marxist objective of Alphabander Coulter, I believe is now
13541200	13545120	absolutely established. I think I know what I'm talking about when I say that. I don't think
13545120	13551280	I'm making it up. I think we have a 200-year-long trajectory of this line of thought stretching
13551280	13557600	back at least to the young Hegelians, if not Hegel himself. This project has progressed for 200
13557600	13564080	years. It has caused nothing but calamity everywhere it obtains power. It's attempting to obtain power
13564080	13569760	through wokeness in the United States and throughout the West today. We should not let that happen.
13571120	13575760	My practical advice is that people who identify themselves broadly as liberal,
13575760	13579440	and people who identify themselves as conservatives, should find ways to put their
13579440	13585120	differences aside, form an alliance, and start pushing out the Hegelian dialectical
13585120	13589760	leftists. When I say push them out, I mean push them out of positions of power,
13589760	13594560	push them out of positions of influence, which they can only abuse and waste.
13595600	13602560	There's my summary of how Hegel is the roots of a huge religious movement that has been
13602560	13609120	going for 200 years. The woke are its most evangelistic and puritanical eruption
13609920	13614480	so far in history. That's why I've compared them. Many of them are, in fact, in the United
13614480	13620400	States at least, coming from a tradition of lapsed Calvinism. They filled in their Calvinist roots
13621760	13627360	where the Puritanism comes out of. With this woke ideology as the new operating system,
13627440	13633920	they've adopted a Hegelian faith. If you are a Christian, I hope you are perfectly clear now on
13633920	13639600	why anything in this kind of critical social justice, critical theory, critical race theory,
13639600	13645600	et cetera, line of thought is heretical to the Christian faith as it's been traditionally or
13645600	13651680	in reformed circles practiced. You do not believe in a God that is becoming, that is actualized through
13651680	13656400	the activities of human beings. You believe in a God that is and is transcendent. You do not believe
13656400	13660800	in a trinity where one part feeds into another and creates a spiral through utopia at the end of
13660800	13666720	the world. You believe in a God that created the world three pieces are co-eternal and perfect
13666720	13672320	and that only He knows the hour of the eschaton. It is an absolute heresy to believe that you can
13672320	13676320	somehow combine these. As a matter of fact, just for a last note for my Christian friends,
13676320	13681120	it is a dialectical process, just like we've been talking about, to believe that you can.
13681120	13685920	So what you would have is Christian faith as it is. Let's bring in something like critical race
13685920	13691440	theory as an antithesis, a Hegelian faith, and then let's try to find a synthesis. But the synthesis
13691440	13696640	of anything in a Hegelian thing is going to be Hegelian. So you've already been dragged into a
13696640	13703680	heretical frame. So Christians need to absolutely repel this on theological grounds. Everybody else
13703680	13708320	and Christians need to reject this on ethical grounds, on reasonable grounds, on evidentiary
13708320	13714720	grounds, on just everyday good people common sense grounds, and on the sense of knowing that our
13714720	13719680	society was premised on the fact that, again, just to bring this up again, it's so important
13719680	13727600	that rights, this is the Lockean frame, the liberal view that rights are granted by the creator,
13727600	13731840	we are endowed by a creator with inalienable rights. They are not privileges to be granted
13731840	13738480	by a state that we are totally to subvert ourselves to. And that's the Hegelian view. So
13738480	13742960	we're going to reject statism, we're going to reject collectivism, and we're going to defend
13742960	13749600	the values that have made everything work throughout the West for just as long,
13749600	13753120	or if not longer, than these two centuries of Hegelian religion.
