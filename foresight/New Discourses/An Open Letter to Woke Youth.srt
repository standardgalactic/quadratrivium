00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,160
Hello everybody, this is James Lindsay and you are listening to New Discourses Bullets

2
00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:21,160
where I give you a short summary of one topic from woke Marxism that I think we need to

3
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:23,840
know in order to be able to defeat it.

4
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:29,400
Today the episode is actually an open letter to young woke people.

5
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:34,200
And so my normal listeners, this isn't exactly for you, but you should take it to heart.

6
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:35,200
You should share it.

7
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:36,280
You should think about it.

8
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:38,960
But this is for young woke people.

9
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:44,400
I think that we should care enough about young woke people and woke people more broadly

10
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:46,040
to tell them the truth.

11
00:00:46,040 --> 00:00:51,640
I think it's very important in fact to drag woke people out of the false reality they

12
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:54,400
inhabit and back to the truth.

13
00:00:54,400 --> 00:01:01,680
So I've written an open letter and I'm going to actually read that for this episode.

14
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:09,040
So dear young woke people, I think you'll find what I have to say to you mostly incomprehensible

15
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:12,520
here, but you need to hear it.

16
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:18,680
What you are participating in right now, whether you know it or not, is Western Maoism, like

17
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:21,440
Mao Zedong from China.

18
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:26,400
This is what your schools and universities and influencers are miseducating you, in fact

19
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:29,200
brainwashing you into.

20
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:36,800
Western Maoism, Maoism with American characteristics, and you need to know about where this goes

21
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:40,040
because it doesn't go well for you in the end.

22
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:42,840
If your movement loses, you lose.

23
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:45,840
If your movement wins, you lose.

24
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:50,000
In the meantime, you lose yourselves.

25
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:56,080
You are being molded, and that is the word, you are being molded into the Western equivalent

26
00:01:56,080 --> 00:02:02,160
of Mao Zedong's infamous red guard, which he made use of for just two years before destroying

27
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:03,160
them.

28
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:08,240
He explained clearly that different things are needed at different phases of the revolution,

29
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:12,960
and then when they're not needed anymore, they're gone away with.

30
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:18,520
He needed a youth rebellion to remove his political enemies and to consolidate his power.

31
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:22,440
He needed that until he didn't need it anymore.

32
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:30,440
In 1967, the red guard succeeded at defeating Mao's political rival in the CCP, Liu Xiaoqi.

33
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:36,640
And within months, Mao declared the movement too far left, too radical, too destabilizing,

34
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:40,800
and he unleashed his People's Liberation Army to put it down.

35
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:42,200
Some died.

36
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:46,440
Most were sent to the countryside to get re-education and labor camps while living in squalor and

37
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:48,440
primitive conditions.

38
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:50,640
That was their reward.

39
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:53,800
Yours will be similar.

40
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:59,320
To get a little bit historical and philosophical, the whole philosophy behind Woke is based

41
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:05,200
upon the formulations of GWF Hegel's vision, written down in the early 19th century.

42
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:09,320
He explained how to move history to its intended end.

43
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:15,040
You might call this the right side of history, and that's done through conflict.

44
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:20,800
The recipe is simple, manufacture the conflict, use the conflict, and move history with the

45
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:24,440
conflict through a kind of social alchemy.

46
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:31,280
You are the agents of that manufactured conflict, change agents, or historical agents, or historical

47
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:33,720
agents of change.

48
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:40,680
What Hegel said about you, though, is this, history uses people and then discards them.

49
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:44,920
As a movement, Woke believes itself to be the movement of history.

50
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:47,960
History is using you to move itself.

51
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:50,720
Once it does, it will discard you.

52
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:56,040
The conflicts of yesterday aren't relevant today, and they won't be needed tomorrow.

53
00:03:56,040 --> 00:04:01,540
The agents of history today lose their relevance in the instant they succeed, and history moves

54
00:04:01,540 --> 00:04:06,880
on necessarily without you and the conflict you generate.

55
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:12,400
You know how everything in Woke philosophy is said to be temporal and spatial that is

56
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:15,120
contingent?

57
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:21,720
It's all some matter of time and space in some place, or so are you.

58
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:26,360
That's how this philosophy thinks about everything, including you.

59
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:30,880
You are a contingency for the Woke Marxist movement.

60
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:33,880
You have your time until you don't.

61
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:38,360
When you become useless or a hindrance to the movement of history, you will be discarded

62
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:41,080
by history.

63
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:45,520
Every Marxist and Hegelian movement in history has proceeded this way, and this one will

64
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:46,880
not be different.

65
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:49,240
I wish you luck with that.

66
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:54,600
In the past, activists like yourselves were seen as useful political prostitutes, and

67
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:59,800
after the revolution you were lined up against the wall and shot, or deported to labor reeducation

68
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:03,760
camps and ground into destruction.

69
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:09,900
Mao explained all of this in 1957, though if you've read it, you probably can't realize

70
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:14,620
that it applies to you, because you think you're on the right side of history.

71
00:05:14,620 --> 00:05:21,700
He separated the world into, quote, the people and enemies, and he detailed how each of these

72
00:05:21,700 --> 00:05:24,060
are to be properly dealt with.

73
00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:30,440
The enemies are to be hated, silenced, bullied, even beaten, and destroyed, sometimes killed.

74
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:35,420
That's mostly your job, though the government will help, just far enough so that it doesn't

75
00:05:35,420 --> 00:05:37,820
look tyrannical.

76
00:05:37,820 --> 00:05:42,900
The people on the other hand are to be handled differently, though to be reeducated, brainwashed,

77
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:48,740
criticized, struggled, until they hold all and only the right opinions, and never the

78
00:05:48,740 --> 00:05:53,260
wrong ones, which is a process that will take their entire lives.

79
00:05:53,260 --> 00:05:55,740
It's never done.

80
00:05:55,740 --> 00:05:59,840
That's what you've signed up for, thinking yourselves virtuous, thinking you're going

81
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:06,000
to do better, seeking absolution for your good fortune and your privilege, seeking revenge

82
00:06:06,020 --> 00:06:11,320
for the inequities you perceive in your so-called lived experience.

83
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:16,140
Everyone in this system is abused, though, and everyone who participates in it becomes

84
00:06:16,140 --> 00:06:17,580
an abuser.

85
00:06:17,580 --> 00:06:24,260
You know it, you live it, you give it, and you receive it constantly.

86
00:06:24,260 --> 00:06:26,700
Abuse.

87
00:06:26,700 --> 00:06:31,300
What you need to understand about the people you've been trained to see as your enemies,

88
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:36,720
you might call them transphobes, or racists, or fascists, or homophobes, or whatever else,

89
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:41,160
is that most of these people, you think are those things, are not those things at all.

90
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:45,800
Yes, there are some out there, but most are not that.

91
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:51,600
You have been trained to hate, allegedly in the name of stopping hate.

92
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:58,600
These people are by and large trying to warn you, not trying to uphold oppression against

93
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:00,080
you.

94
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:04,540
Now what you need to know about the people in the movement you're supporting, the people

95
00:07:04,540 --> 00:07:09,900
as Mao had it, which includes your friends in the woke movement, is that you are less

96
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:12,860
than disposable to these people.

97
00:07:12,860 --> 00:07:15,340
Being contingent barely covers it.

98
00:07:15,340 --> 00:07:20,700
The woke movement pretends to care about you, or worse, people who look like you, but it

99
00:07:20,700 --> 00:07:23,260
does not care about you.

100
00:07:23,260 --> 00:07:29,660
It is using you so its sociopathic fringe can gain power over society, using you as

101
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:34,240
cannon fodder for their unconventional political warfare apparatus.

102
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:39,160
Instead of living your life, growing, learning, preparing a future, building a family, you're

103
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:43,640
doing activism for them, and they will discard you.

104
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:46,960
And I mean it, they will discard you.

105
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:48,280
Why?

106
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:54,080
Because you are worse than contingent, you are worse than disposable, once they get power,

107
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:57,080
you actually become a problem.

108
00:07:57,080 --> 00:08:03,580
You don't just become obsolete as the revolution succeeds, you become a liability to what follows.

109
00:08:03,580 --> 00:08:09,060
You're being trained by this movement right now to be a destabilizer.

110
00:08:09,060 --> 00:08:12,540
That's what all this disrupt and dismantle stuff is about.

111
00:08:12,540 --> 00:08:17,860
You are misled to believe that you're disrupting and dismantling systems of oppression, but

112
00:08:17,860 --> 00:08:22,940
you're merely displacing the existing society for one they will seize control over.

113
00:08:22,940 --> 00:08:27,640
You're disrupting and dismantling the foundations of your own liberty so that tyrants can rule

114
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:33,000
over not just the people that you have been trained to hate, but over everyone.

115
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:39,080
They need you to destabilize the existing system, but they do not need anyone to destabilize

116
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:42,800
the new system they have planned for us.

117
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:49,400
Their intention is to establish a perfectly stable system with them, and not most of you,

118
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:50,920
on top of it.

119
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:56,620
And people trained and brainwashed to be destabilizers will be a problem in such a system.

120
00:08:56,620 --> 00:08:58,700
Mao said that himself.

121
00:08:58,700 --> 00:09:03,560
Like I said, he said the handling of the people is different in the different phases of the

122
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:05,060
revolution.

123
00:09:05,060 --> 00:09:11,620
First, you encourage and support destabilizers to break down the existing system.

124
00:09:11,620 --> 00:09:15,620
Then when you have power, you crack down on them so that there is total stability under

125
00:09:15,620 --> 00:09:17,260
the new standard.

126
00:09:17,260 --> 00:09:21,640
He called this standard socialist discipline under democratic centralism.

127
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:27,880
Today, it's called sustainability and inclusion, and it's managed under something called stakeholder

128
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:29,880
capitalism.

129
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:35,000
You are an asset to this movement today and will be a liability to it tomorrow.

130
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:39,440
You will be discarded coldly and if necessary violently.

131
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:46,120
Not by your perceived enemies, but by the movement you are actually supporting.

132
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:53,100
Make no mistake, this fate has awaited the change agents of every red revolution in history.

133
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:57,180
Communist defectors have been trying to tell you for decades, longer than most of you have

134
00:09:57,180 --> 00:09:58,180
been alive.

135
00:09:58,180 --> 00:10:02,540
It's written all over the pages of history of communist and other tyrannical regimes,

136
00:10:02,540 --> 00:10:04,620
if you will just read them.

137
00:10:04,620 --> 00:10:08,140
It will not be different in anything except method this time.

138
00:10:08,140 --> 00:10:12,500
If you, as woke Marxists, win, you surely lose.

139
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:17,120
Tell but the most sociopathic and sycophantic of you, in which case you have to hollow yourselves

140
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:22,240
out, sell your souls if you even have one left by then and become a true monster of

141
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:23,240
history.

142
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:29,400
If you don't believe me, let me ask you, do you see any identity politics in China today?

143
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:30,680
Is China woke?

144
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:32,320
Will it go woke?

145
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:33,320
No.

146
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:34,320
They already did that.

147
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:37,200
And that phase of the revolution is over.

148
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:42,280
It is viciously suppressed there and they laugh at you here in the West and call you

149
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:44,020
a bisole.

150
00:10:44,020 --> 00:10:45,420
White left.

151
00:10:45,420 --> 00:10:49,380
They know what you are and how misinformed and misguided you are.

152
00:10:49,380 --> 00:10:53,740
Their operatives attempt to stoke these fires and use you because you are strategically useful

153
00:10:53,740 --> 00:11:00,620
to their anti-American aims, which you have been brainwashed foolishly into sharing.

154
00:11:00,620 --> 00:11:05,140
In China, however, they are openly encouraging patriarchy and masculinity.

155
00:11:05,140 --> 00:11:06,940
They're racially ruthless.

156
00:11:06,940 --> 00:11:09,180
They stamp out homosexuality.

157
00:11:09,180 --> 00:11:10,500
Why?

158
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:15,480
They did their intersectionality already years ago with their red and black identity groups.

159
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:19,560
They got what they wanted out of it and now they've discarded it and its change agents

160
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:22,680
in favor of the power that they were able to seize.

161
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:25,000
Well that's your future too.

162
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,080
It looks like this.

163
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:30,960
Look at the screen, scan your face and smile for the government and don't you dare signal

164
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:35,520
in any way that you think anything that you shouldn't be thinking.

165
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:38,840
Whatever they decide is the right thing to think.

166
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:42,780
You've been falsely convinced that you're the protagonists in a vast morality play

167
00:11:42,780 --> 00:11:47,180
called The Ark of History, now that you're bending it toward justice, that you're on

168
00:11:47,180 --> 00:11:51,660
the right side of history, and that feels good, right up until the boot comes crashing

169
00:11:51,660 --> 00:11:53,740
down on your face.

170
00:11:53,740 --> 00:11:56,340
Then they say you'll realize it.

171
00:11:56,340 --> 00:11:59,220
You are bending the Ark of History, of course.

172
00:11:59,220 --> 00:12:03,100
If we can even indulge such a metaphor, but you're bending it straight into the 21st

173
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:08,820
century gulag, whatever those will look like in our increasingly black mirror society.

174
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:12,280
You will be thought reformed or you will be discarded.

175
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:13,800
So what do you want to be?

176
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:16,680
Do you want to be its guard, Agent Smith?

177
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:19,740
Would you like to be its corrupt administrator?

178
00:12:19,740 --> 00:12:21,880
Is it worth the sale of your soul?

179
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:26,480
Some of you might aspire to such a demonic station in your lives, but most of you don't.

180
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:31,400
You actually want to do the right thing, and you will be subjected to this instead.

181
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:35,840
Even if you take up this evil ambition, don't you know where it goes?

182
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:39,180
Constant paranoia, constant fear, constant risk.

183
00:12:39,180 --> 00:12:44,860
The Red Guard was utilized to destroy Mao's political enemies in the CCP.

184
00:12:44,860 --> 00:12:48,780
And what will you do when they change the specifications of the ideology that you're

185
00:12:48,780 --> 00:12:50,740
supposed to support?

186
00:12:50,740 --> 00:12:53,860
Perhaps one day they'll decide that trans rights are now too expensive and disruptive

187
00:12:53,860 --> 00:12:57,700
for a new system that no longer needs that means of social agitation.

188
00:12:57,700 --> 00:12:59,740
What will you do, resist?

189
00:12:59,740 --> 00:13:01,740
Good luck with that, Comrade.

190
00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:05,380
So if you win, you lose.

191
00:13:05,380 --> 00:13:08,640
You have a right to wonder how this happened to you.

192
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:13,120
Why have your generations been co-opted into this horrible situation?

193
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:17,200
Your education, your schools, your entertainment, your universities, your peers tried to make

194
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:22,520
you change agents and global citizens instead of educated adults?

195
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:27,120
If this system wins, you lose because you know too much and are too big of a problem.

196
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:31,200
Your only option will be to sell your soul to it, and you have to ask, how much is that

197
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:32,200
worth to you?

198
00:13:32,900 --> 00:13:35,900
And do you think I'm kidding about that, by the way?

199
00:13:35,900 --> 00:13:41,620
Mao said, not to have correct political opinions is like not having a soul.

200
00:13:41,620 --> 00:13:43,220
That's what's at stake.

201
00:13:43,220 --> 00:13:47,860
Think about that and what this is costing you, whether you participate in it or cower

202
00:13:47,860 --> 00:13:48,860
against it.

203
00:13:48,860 --> 00:13:50,980
Doesn't this ring true, though?

204
00:13:50,980 --> 00:13:52,580
That's what you're sacrificing.

205
00:13:52,580 --> 00:13:56,540
Every time you tell a lie to fit in, you sell part of your soul.

206
00:13:56,540 --> 00:14:02,140
And how many lies have you told to fit in with the critical crowd around you?

207
00:14:02,140 --> 00:14:06,120
This corruption of you and your future is happening all around you, but most importantly

208
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:09,960
in place of your education, which could otherwise protect you from it.

209
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:14,560
You're not getting the education you could be, or perhaps aren't getting a real education

210
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:15,760
at all.

211
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:20,080
You're not learning to be informed, independent adults who can answer questions about reality

212
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:22,200
and navigate it successfully.

213
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:27,520
You're being taught to have to defer at every turn to some kind of bogus expert, even to

214
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:31,360
answer a question like, what is a woman?

215
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:35,660
There are, of course, costs to this, and not just the obvious ones for you and your future

216
00:14:35,660 --> 00:14:36,900
on a personal level.

217
00:14:36,900 --> 00:14:41,800
The thing you consider your education itself is simultaneously being degraded in every meaningful

218
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:43,020
sense of the word.

219
00:14:43,020 --> 00:14:46,300
It is being corrupted at its most essential level.

220
00:14:46,300 --> 00:14:51,100
You are losing your chance to get educated while the thing we call education itself is

221
00:14:51,100 --> 00:14:54,420
corrupting itself into its opposite.

222
00:14:54,420 --> 00:14:58,900
You are becoming less functional for the world ahead of you, so your education is corrupted,

223
00:14:58,900 --> 00:15:03,400
and you're becoming less and less marketable in the future world, whichever system wins,

224
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:07,480
so the credentialing function education serves is also being corrupted.

225
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:13,640
How useful are you going to be in the coming system, whichever one wins, if you are completely

226
00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:19,400
uneducated, not just a destabilizer, but useless?

227
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:22,640
Of course, the perversity of this is that they're not just doing this to you, they've

228
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:26,440
convinced you to demand it for yourself.

229
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:33,420
You have to demand it for justice, and so you do.

230
00:15:33,420 --> 00:15:37,460
Whichever system wins, you need to understand that you're getting degrees that are increasingly

231
00:15:37,460 --> 00:15:42,500
being seen as liabilities, not assets in the working world that lies around and ahead of

232
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:44,180
you.

233
00:15:44,180 --> 00:15:48,700
If that future is not woke, you're a liability to the future because you've been trained

234
00:15:48,700 --> 00:15:52,860
to be a woke destabilizer and learn to focus on social theory instead of gaining a genuine

235
00:15:52,860 --> 00:15:55,580
education and real skills.

236
00:15:55,580 --> 00:15:59,680
If that future is woke, on the other hand, you're a liability to it because you've been

237
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:05,440
trained to be a destabilizer that the incoming system not only doesn't want but can't abide.

238
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:10,640
And again, they've convinced you to demand this in place of your genuine education.

239
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:13,720
It's sick.

240
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:19,560
You have at most one option, supposing the woke win, and that's to sell out completely,

241
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:23,320
to have nothing authentic left about yourself.

242
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:28,540
The only place you will have a future is inside the most corrupt megacorporate sector that

243
00:16:28,540 --> 00:16:35,020
is our new western Soviet, a council of stakeholders that knows the science of right human relations

244
00:16:35,020 --> 00:16:40,580
and holds the keys to sustainable development in a circular economy.

245
00:16:40,580 --> 00:16:45,300
If it supports trans rights and reducing emissions today, you will support those things.

246
00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:49,780
If it changes its mind tomorrow for the glory of the new system, so will you, or you will

247
00:16:49,780 --> 00:16:51,580
be eliminated.

248
00:16:51,580 --> 00:16:57,920
Your only path to success inside the system you advocate for is to become a hollow, soulless

249
00:16:57,920 --> 00:17:03,120
functionary, an aphistic megacorporate and or governmental public-private partnership

250
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:04,880
machine.

251
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:10,040
Your only path to success outside of this system is to abandon this activism as soon

252
00:17:10,040 --> 00:17:17,840
as possible and start healing yourself psychologically, emotionally, and educationally.

253
00:17:17,840 --> 00:17:23,340
Your fate, if the woke system wins, is to be disposed of or hollowed out, and use as

254
00:17:23,340 --> 00:17:28,020
a functionary of its changing whims, and this should have little appeal to you.

255
00:17:28,020 --> 00:17:32,380
It certainly won't bring about justice or satisfaction, and it won't allow you to be

256
00:17:32,380 --> 00:17:35,940
a prosperous individual or an individual at all.

257
00:17:35,940 --> 00:17:40,220
Your false prosperity will be available in direct proportion to your inauthenticity and

258
00:17:40,220 --> 00:17:45,020
corruptibility, the markers of your true utility to the machine you don't seem to realize

259
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:47,400
you're supporting.

260
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:50,640
There's no you on the other side of this.

261
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:55,840
On the other hand, your fate, if the woke system loses, is a hard life that's made easier

262
00:17:55,840 --> 00:18:02,080
only by repenting of these errors and working to correct them, and the sooner the better.

263
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:06,120
Already employers throughout the West increasingly suspect that if you even have a college degree

264
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:11,920
at all, you're probably woke, radically leftist, entitled, unlikely to work hard, likely to

265
00:18:11,940 --> 00:18:17,500
create a hostile working environment, underskilled or unskilled, and likely to sue if you're

266
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:21,100
fired even on perfectly solid and reasonable grounds.

267
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:23,700
They have every reason to believe this.

268
00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:28,460
That makes you very, very unattractive.

269
00:18:28,460 --> 00:18:31,260
If you are woke, they know it's true.

270
00:18:31,260 --> 00:18:35,900
You actually are a liability to them, and many of them are only still hiring you today

271
00:18:35,900 --> 00:18:37,660
because they have to.

272
00:18:37,660 --> 00:18:41,380
To keep their place in the corrupt corporate scoring schemes that control the way business

273
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:43,640
is done now in the West.

274
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:48,960
So you're either unhireable or hireable only as an asset to satisfy the ESG demands of

275
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:53,400
a sprawling corrupt bureaucracy.

276
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:56,240
Isn't that great?

277
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:57,760
And what happens if it gives way?

278
00:18:57,760 --> 00:18:58,760
Who are you?

279
00:18:58,760 --> 00:19:03,880
And if you help it succeed and participate in it, what are you?

280
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:06,480
So the question is why you?

281
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:07,560
Why not somebody else?

282
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:08,560
Why now?

283
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:09,560
Why you?

284
00:19:10,540 --> 00:19:15,580
Because you happen to be at the age you are at the worst time in Western history to be

285
00:19:15,580 --> 00:19:17,140
the age you are.

286
00:19:17,140 --> 00:19:19,300
That's it.

287
00:19:19,300 --> 00:19:23,460
Because many of you come from wealth and status and other resources the system covets and

288
00:19:23,460 --> 00:19:25,260
requires to succeed.

289
00:19:25,260 --> 00:19:32,220
You see, they're not really against privilege in the woke Marxist movement.

290
00:19:32,220 --> 00:19:34,220
They actually really like privilege.

291
00:19:34,220 --> 00:19:39,180
They just want to seize it and redistribute it and repurpose it to their ends.

292
00:19:39,180 --> 00:19:40,840
You are a resource to them.

293
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:42,320
They need those resources.

294
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:44,240
They need your enthusiasm and your zeal.

295
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:45,760
They need your talent.

296
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:48,960
They need your impressionable minds.

297
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:53,640
They need the future citizens and the future leaders of the world.

298
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:58,520
But you must remember, history uses people and then discards them.

299
00:19:58,520 --> 00:20:04,640
So they won't need you for long and they'll only need you for specific purposes.

300
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:09,940
Then you will either be corrected or discarded, unless you choose to come off worse by selling

301
00:20:09,940 --> 00:20:10,940
out.

302
00:20:10,940 --> 00:20:16,080
So my message to you about the woke Marxist movement is simple.

303
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:18,660
You need to know what you're really involved in.

304
00:20:18,660 --> 00:20:22,940
Stop participating, deprogram yourself and your friends and start fighting for the blessings

305
00:20:22,940 --> 00:20:27,780
of liberty that allowed you to have the privilege to think this way in the first place.

306
00:20:27,780 --> 00:20:29,700
You can and might lose it.

307
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:35,000
You're the first generations in American history to face the loss of liberty.

308
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:41,560
But if you do, if you support the woke movement, you do so by enslaving yourselves.

309
00:20:41,560 --> 00:20:46,600
You have been sold a false promise of liberation in place of liberty and you need to realize

310
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:49,620
that you're being scammed.

311
00:20:49,620 --> 00:20:52,160
Liberation movements are lies.

312
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:57,400
Mao called his army the same one he dispatched to destroy your counterparts in the Red Guard,

313
00:20:57,400 --> 00:21:02,420
the People's Liberation Army, and he called it that for a reason.

314
00:21:02,420 --> 00:21:05,060
Liberation is a lie.

315
00:21:05,060 --> 00:21:11,060
The oldest recorded cautionary tale in human history is the story of the serpent and Eve

316
00:21:11,060 --> 00:21:16,360
in the third chapter of Genesis, and it warns about this specifically.

317
00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:22,300
It warns humanity about liberation, and you can understand that message whether you are

318
00:21:22,300 --> 00:21:24,820
religious or not.

319
00:21:24,820 --> 00:21:27,240
Liberation is a destructive lie.

320
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:31,620
We cannot liberate ourselves from the truth or from reality.

321
00:21:31,620 --> 00:21:36,420
If you liberate yourself from a free society, you end up in a tyranny.

322
00:21:36,420 --> 00:21:38,520
You need to fight for liberty.

323
00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:43,500
You think you are in chains, but your chains have been forged by frauds and are locked

324
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:46,220
only in your heads.

325
00:21:46,220 --> 00:21:47,820
You are the future.

326
00:21:47,820 --> 00:21:49,940
Your choices matter.

327
00:21:49,940 --> 00:21:50,940
Choose better.
