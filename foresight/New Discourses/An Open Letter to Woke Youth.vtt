00:00.000 --> 00:15.160
Hello everybody, this is James Lindsay and you are listening to New Discourses Bullets

00:15.160 --> 00:21.160
where I give you a short summary of one topic from woke Marxism that I think we need to

00:21.160 --> 00:23.840
know in order to be able to defeat it.

00:23.840 --> 00:29.400
Today the episode is actually an open letter to young woke people.

00:29.400 --> 00:34.200
And so my normal listeners, this isn't exactly for you, but you should take it to heart.

00:34.200 --> 00:35.200
You should share it.

00:35.200 --> 00:36.280
You should think about it.

00:36.280 --> 00:38.960
But this is for young woke people.

00:38.960 --> 00:44.400
I think that we should care enough about young woke people and woke people more broadly

00:44.400 --> 00:46.040
to tell them the truth.

00:46.040 --> 00:51.640
I think it's very important in fact to drag woke people out of the false reality they

00:51.640 --> 00:54.400
inhabit and back to the truth.

00:54.400 --> 01:01.680
So I've written an open letter and I'm going to actually read that for this episode.

01:01.680 --> 01:09.040
So dear young woke people, I think you'll find what I have to say to you mostly incomprehensible

01:09.040 --> 01:12.520
here, but you need to hear it.

01:12.520 --> 01:18.680
What you are participating in right now, whether you know it or not, is Western Maoism, like

01:18.680 --> 01:21.440
Mao Zedong from China.

01:21.440 --> 01:26.400
This is what your schools and universities and influencers are miseducating you, in fact

01:26.400 --> 01:29.200
brainwashing you into.

01:29.200 --> 01:36.800
Western Maoism, Maoism with American characteristics, and you need to know about where this goes

01:36.800 --> 01:40.040
because it doesn't go well for you in the end.

01:40.040 --> 01:42.840
If your movement loses, you lose.

01:42.840 --> 01:45.840
If your movement wins, you lose.

01:45.840 --> 01:50.000
In the meantime, you lose yourselves.

01:50.000 --> 01:56.080
You are being molded, and that is the word, you are being molded into the Western equivalent

01:56.080 --> 02:02.160
of Mao Zedong's infamous red guard, which he made use of for just two years before destroying

02:02.160 --> 02:03.160
them.

02:03.160 --> 02:08.240
He explained clearly that different things are needed at different phases of the revolution,

02:08.240 --> 02:12.960
and then when they're not needed anymore, they're gone away with.

02:12.960 --> 02:18.520
He needed a youth rebellion to remove his political enemies and to consolidate his power.

02:18.520 --> 02:22.440
He needed that until he didn't need it anymore.

02:22.440 --> 02:30.440
In 1967, the red guard succeeded at defeating Mao's political rival in the CCP, Liu Xiaoqi.

02:30.440 --> 02:36.640
And within months, Mao declared the movement too far left, too radical, too destabilizing,

02:36.640 --> 02:40.800
and he unleashed his People's Liberation Army to put it down.

02:40.800 --> 02:42.200
Some died.

02:42.200 --> 02:46.440
Most were sent to the countryside to get re-education and labor camps while living in squalor and

02:46.440 --> 02:48.440
primitive conditions.

02:48.440 --> 02:50.640
That was their reward.

02:50.640 --> 02:53.800
Yours will be similar.

02:53.800 --> 02:59.320
To get a little bit historical and philosophical, the whole philosophy behind Woke is based

02:59.320 --> 03:05.200
upon the formulations of GWF Hegel's vision, written down in the early 19th century.

03:05.200 --> 03:09.320
He explained how to move history to its intended end.

03:09.320 --> 03:15.040
You might call this the right side of history, and that's done through conflict.

03:15.040 --> 03:20.800
The recipe is simple, manufacture the conflict, use the conflict, and move history with the

03:20.800 --> 03:24.440
conflict through a kind of social alchemy.

03:24.440 --> 03:31.280
You are the agents of that manufactured conflict, change agents, or historical agents, or historical

03:31.280 --> 03:33.720
agents of change.

03:33.720 --> 03:40.680
What Hegel said about you, though, is this, history uses people and then discards them.

03:40.680 --> 03:44.920
As a movement, Woke believes itself to be the movement of history.

03:44.920 --> 03:47.960
History is using you to move itself.

03:47.960 --> 03:50.720
Once it does, it will discard you.

03:50.720 --> 03:56.040
The conflicts of yesterday aren't relevant today, and they won't be needed tomorrow.

03:56.040 --> 04:01.540
The agents of history today lose their relevance in the instant they succeed, and history moves

04:01.540 --> 04:06.880
on necessarily without you and the conflict you generate.

04:06.880 --> 04:12.400
You know how everything in Woke philosophy is said to be temporal and spatial that is

04:12.400 --> 04:15.120
contingent?

04:15.120 --> 04:21.720
It's all some matter of time and space in some place, or so are you.

04:21.720 --> 04:26.360
That's how this philosophy thinks about everything, including you.

04:26.360 --> 04:30.880
You are a contingency for the Woke Marxist movement.

04:30.880 --> 04:33.880
You have your time until you don't.

04:33.880 --> 04:38.360
When you become useless or a hindrance to the movement of history, you will be discarded

04:38.360 --> 04:41.080
by history.

04:41.080 --> 04:45.520
Every Marxist and Hegelian movement in history has proceeded this way, and this one will

04:45.520 --> 04:46.880
not be different.

04:46.880 --> 04:49.240
I wish you luck with that.

04:49.240 --> 04:54.600
In the past, activists like yourselves were seen as useful political prostitutes, and

04:54.600 --> 04:59.800
after the revolution you were lined up against the wall and shot, or deported to labor reeducation

04:59.800 --> 05:03.760
camps and ground into destruction.

05:03.760 --> 05:09.900
Mao explained all of this in 1957, though if you've read it, you probably can't realize

05:09.900 --> 05:14.620
that it applies to you, because you think you're on the right side of history.

05:14.620 --> 05:21.700
He separated the world into, quote, the people and enemies, and he detailed how each of these

05:21.700 --> 05:24.060
are to be properly dealt with.

05:24.060 --> 05:30.440
The enemies are to be hated, silenced, bullied, even beaten, and destroyed, sometimes killed.

05:30.440 --> 05:35.420
That's mostly your job, though the government will help, just far enough so that it doesn't

05:35.420 --> 05:37.820
look tyrannical.

05:37.820 --> 05:42.900
The people on the other hand are to be handled differently, though to be reeducated, brainwashed,

05:42.900 --> 05:48.740
criticized, struggled, until they hold all and only the right opinions, and never the

05:48.740 --> 05:53.260
wrong ones, which is a process that will take their entire lives.

05:53.260 --> 05:55.740
It's never done.

05:55.740 --> 05:59.840
That's what you've signed up for, thinking yourselves virtuous, thinking you're going

05:59.840 --> 06:06.000
to do better, seeking absolution for your good fortune and your privilege, seeking revenge

06:06.020 --> 06:11.320
for the inequities you perceive in your so-called lived experience.

06:11.320 --> 06:16.140
Everyone in this system is abused, though, and everyone who participates in it becomes

06:16.140 --> 06:17.580
an abuser.

06:17.580 --> 06:24.260
You know it, you live it, you give it, and you receive it constantly.

06:24.260 --> 06:26.700
Abuse.

06:26.700 --> 06:31.300
What you need to understand about the people you've been trained to see as your enemies,

06:31.320 --> 06:36.720
you might call them transphobes, or racists, or fascists, or homophobes, or whatever else,

06:36.720 --> 06:41.160
is that most of these people, you think are those things, are not those things at all.

06:41.160 --> 06:45.800
Yes, there are some out there, but most are not that.

06:45.800 --> 06:51.600
You have been trained to hate, allegedly in the name of stopping hate.

06:51.600 --> 06:58.600
These people are by and large trying to warn you, not trying to uphold oppression against

06:58.600 --> 07:00.080
you.

07:00.080 --> 07:04.540
Now what you need to know about the people in the movement you're supporting, the people

07:04.540 --> 07:09.900
as Mao had it, which includes your friends in the woke movement, is that you are less

07:09.900 --> 07:12.860
than disposable to these people.

07:12.860 --> 07:15.340
Being contingent barely covers it.

07:15.340 --> 07:20.700
The woke movement pretends to care about you, or worse, people who look like you, but it

07:20.700 --> 07:23.260
does not care about you.

07:23.260 --> 07:29.660
It is using you so its sociopathic fringe can gain power over society, using you as

07:29.740 --> 07:34.240
cannon fodder for their unconventional political warfare apparatus.

07:34.240 --> 07:39.160
Instead of living your life, growing, learning, preparing a future, building a family, you're

07:39.160 --> 07:43.640
doing activism for them, and they will discard you.

07:43.640 --> 07:46.960
And I mean it, they will discard you.

07:46.960 --> 07:48.280
Why?

07:48.280 --> 07:54.080
Because you are worse than contingent, you are worse than disposable, once they get power,

07:54.080 --> 07:57.080
you actually become a problem.

07:57.080 --> 08:03.580
You don't just become obsolete as the revolution succeeds, you become a liability to what follows.

08:03.580 --> 08:09.060
You're being trained by this movement right now to be a destabilizer.

08:09.060 --> 08:12.540
That's what all this disrupt and dismantle stuff is about.

08:12.540 --> 08:17.860
You are misled to believe that you're disrupting and dismantling systems of oppression, but

08:17.860 --> 08:22.940
you're merely displacing the existing society for one they will seize control over.

08:22.940 --> 08:27.640
You're disrupting and dismantling the foundations of your own liberty so that tyrants can rule

08:27.640 --> 08:33.000
over not just the people that you have been trained to hate, but over everyone.

08:33.000 --> 08:39.080
They need you to destabilize the existing system, but they do not need anyone to destabilize

08:39.080 --> 08:42.800
the new system they have planned for us.

08:42.800 --> 08:49.400
Their intention is to establish a perfectly stable system with them, and not most of you,

08:49.400 --> 08:50.920
on top of it.

08:50.920 --> 08:56.620
And people trained and brainwashed to be destabilizers will be a problem in such a system.

08:56.620 --> 08:58.700
Mao said that himself.

08:58.700 --> 09:03.560
Like I said, he said the handling of the people is different in the different phases of the

09:03.560 --> 09:05.060
revolution.

09:05.060 --> 09:11.620
First, you encourage and support destabilizers to break down the existing system.

09:11.620 --> 09:15.620
Then when you have power, you crack down on them so that there is total stability under

09:15.620 --> 09:17.260
the new standard.

09:17.260 --> 09:21.640
He called this standard socialist discipline under democratic centralism.

09:21.640 --> 09:27.880
Today, it's called sustainability and inclusion, and it's managed under something called stakeholder

09:27.880 --> 09:29.880
capitalism.

09:29.880 --> 09:35.000
You are an asset to this movement today and will be a liability to it tomorrow.

09:35.000 --> 09:39.440
You will be discarded coldly and if necessary violently.

09:39.440 --> 09:46.120
Not by your perceived enemies, but by the movement you are actually supporting.

09:46.120 --> 09:53.100
Make no mistake, this fate has awaited the change agents of every red revolution in history.

09:53.100 --> 09:57.180
Communist defectors have been trying to tell you for decades, longer than most of you have

09:57.180 --> 09:58.180
been alive.

09:58.180 --> 10:02.540
It's written all over the pages of history of communist and other tyrannical regimes,

10:02.540 --> 10:04.620
if you will just read them.

10:04.620 --> 10:08.140
It will not be different in anything except method this time.

10:08.140 --> 10:12.500
If you, as woke Marxists, win, you surely lose.

10:12.500 --> 10:17.120
Tell but the most sociopathic and sycophantic of you, in which case you have to hollow yourselves

10:17.120 --> 10:22.240
out, sell your souls if you even have one left by then and become a true monster of

10:22.240 --> 10:23.240
history.

10:23.240 --> 10:29.400
If you don't believe me, let me ask you, do you see any identity politics in China today?

10:29.400 --> 10:30.680
Is China woke?

10:30.680 --> 10:32.320
Will it go woke?

10:32.320 --> 10:33.320
No.

10:33.320 --> 10:34.320
They already did that.

10:34.320 --> 10:37.200
And that phase of the revolution is over.

10:37.200 --> 10:42.280
It is viciously suppressed there and they laugh at you here in the West and call you

10:42.280 --> 10:44.020
a bisole.

10:44.020 --> 10:45.420
White left.

10:45.420 --> 10:49.380
They know what you are and how misinformed and misguided you are.

10:49.380 --> 10:53.740
Their operatives attempt to stoke these fires and use you because you are strategically useful

10:53.740 --> 11:00.620
to their anti-American aims, which you have been brainwashed foolishly into sharing.

11:00.620 --> 11:05.140
In China, however, they are openly encouraging patriarchy and masculinity.

11:05.140 --> 11:06.940
They're racially ruthless.

11:06.940 --> 11:09.180
They stamp out homosexuality.

11:09.180 --> 11:10.500
Why?

11:10.500 --> 11:15.480
They did their intersectionality already years ago with their red and black identity groups.

11:15.480 --> 11:19.560
They got what they wanted out of it and now they've discarded it and its change agents

11:19.560 --> 11:22.680
in favor of the power that they were able to seize.

11:22.680 --> 11:25.000
Well that's your future too.

11:25.000 --> 11:27.080
It looks like this.

11:27.080 --> 11:30.960
Look at the screen, scan your face and smile for the government and don't you dare signal

11:30.960 --> 11:35.520
in any way that you think anything that you shouldn't be thinking.

11:35.520 --> 11:38.840
Whatever they decide is the right thing to think.

11:38.840 --> 11:42.780
You've been falsely convinced that you're the protagonists in a vast morality play

11:42.780 --> 11:47.180
called The Ark of History, now that you're bending it toward justice, that you're on

11:47.180 --> 11:51.660
the right side of history, and that feels good, right up until the boot comes crashing

11:51.660 --> 11:53.740
down on your face.

11:53.740 --> 11:56.340
Then they say you'll realize it.

11:56.340 --> 11:59.220
You are bending the Ark of History, of course.

11:59.220 --> 12:03.100
If we can even indulge such a metaphor, but you're bending it straight into the 21st

12:03.100 --> 12:08.820
century gulag, whatever those will look like in our increasingly black mirror society.

12:08.840 --> 12:12.280
You will be thought reformed or you will be discarded.

12:12.280 --> 12:13.800
So what do you want to be?

12:13.800 --> 12:16.680
Do you want to be its guard, Agent Smith?

12:16.680 --> 12:19.740
Would you like to be its corrupt administrator?

12:19.740 --> 12:21.880
Is it worth the sale of your soul?

12:21.880 --> 12:26.480
Some of you might aspire to such a demonic station in your lives, but most of you don't.

12:26.480 --> 12:31.400
You actually want to do the right thing, and you will be subjected to this instead.

12:31.400 --> 12:35.840
Even if you take up this evil ambition, don't you know where it goes?

12:35.840 --> 12:39.180
Constant paranoia, constant fear, constant risk.

12:39.180 --> 12:44.860
The Red Guard was utilized to destroy Mao's political enemies in the CCP.

12:44.860 --> 12:48.780
And what will you do when they change the specifications of the ideology that you're

12:48.780 --> 12:50.740
supposed to support?

12:50.740 --> 12:53.860
Perhaps one day they'll decide that trans rights are now too expensive and disruptive

12:53.860 --> 12:57.700
for a new system that no longer needs that means of social agitation.

12:57.700 --> 12:59.740
What will you do, resist?

12:59.740 --> 13:01.740
Good luck with that, Comrade.

13:01.740 --> 13:05.380
So if you win, you lose.

13:05.380 --> 13:08.640
You have a right to wonder how this happened to you.

13:08.640 --> 13:13.120
Why have your generations been co-opted into this horrible situation?

13:13.120 --> 13:17.200
Your education, your schools, your entertainment, your universities, your peers tried to make

13:17.200 --> 13:22.520
you change agents and global citizens instead of educated adults?

13:22.520 --> 13:27.120
If this system wins, you lose because you know too much and are too big of a problem.

13:27.120 --> 13:31.200
Your only option will be to sell your soul to it, and you have to ask, how much is that

13:31.200 --> 13:32.200
worth to you?

13:32.900 --> 13:35.900
And do you think I'm kidding about that, by the way?

13:35.900 --> 13:41.620
Mao said, not to have correct political opinions is like not having a soul.

13:41.620 --> 13:43.220
That's what's at stake.

13:43.220 --> 13:47.860
Think about that and what this is costing you, whether you participate in it or cower

13:47.860 --> 13:48.860
against it.

13:48.860 --> 13:50.980
Doesn't this ring true, though?

13:50.980 --> 13:52.580
That's what you're sacrificing.

13:52.580 --> 13:56.540
Every time you tell a lie to fit in, you sell part of your soul.

13:56.540 --> 14:02.140
And how many lies have you told to fit in with the critical crowd around you?

14:02.140 --> 14:06.120
This corruption of you and your future is happening all around you, but most importantly

14:06.120 --> 14:09.960
in place of your education, which could otherwise protect you from it.

14:09.960 --> 14:14.560
You're not getting the education you could be, or perhaps aren't getting a real education

14:14.560 --> 14:15.760
at all.

14:15.760 --> 14:20.080
You're not learning to be informed, independent adults who can answer questions about reality

14:20.080 --> 14:22.200
and navigate it successfully.

14:22.200 --> 14:27.520
You're being taught to have to defer at every turn to some kind of bogus expert, even to

14:27.520 --> 14:31.360
answer a question like, what is a woman?

14:31.360 --> 14:35.660
There are, of course, costs to this, and not just the obvious ones for you and your future

14:35.660 --> 14:36.900
on a personal level.

14:36.900 --> 14:41.800
The thing you consider your education itself is simultaneously being degraded in every meaningful

14:41.800 --> 14:43.020
sense of the word.

14:43.020 --> 14:46.300
It is being corrupted at its most essential level.

14:46.300 --> 14:51.100
You are losing your chance to get educated while the thing we call education itself is

14:51.100 --> 14:54.420
corrupting itself into its opposite.

14:54.420 --> 14:58.900
You are becoming less functional for the world ahead of you, so your education is corrupted,

14:58.900 --> 15:03.400
and you're becoming less and less marketable in the future world, whichever system wins,

15:03.400 --> 15:07.480
so the credentialing function education serves is also being corrupted.

15:07.480 --> 15:13.640
How useful are you going to be in the coming system, whichever one wins, if you are completely

15:13.640 --> 15:19.400
uneducated, not just a destabilizer, but useless?

15:19.400 --> 15:22.640
Of course, the perversity of this is that they're not just doing this to you, they've

15:22.640 --> 15:26.440
convinced you to demand it for yourself.

15:26.440 --> 15:33.420
You have to demand it for justice, and so you do.

15:33.420 --> 15:37.460
Whichever system wins, you need to understand that you're getting degrees that are increasingly

15:37.460 --> 15:42.500
being seen as liabilities, not assets in the working world that lies around and ahead of

15:42.500 --> 15:44.180
you.

15:44.180 --> 15:48.700
If that future is not woke, you're a liability to the future because you've been trained

15:48.700 --> 15:52.860
to be a woke destabilizer and learn to focus on social theory instead of gaining a genuine

15:52.860 --> 15:55.580
education and real skills.

15:55.580 --> 15:59.680
If that future is woke, on the other hand, you're a liability to it because you've been

15:59.680 --> 16:05.440
trained to be a destabilizer that the incoming system not only doesn't want but can't abide.

16:05.440 --> 16:10.640
And again, they've convinced you to demand this in place of your genuine education.

16:10.640 --> 16:13.720
It's sick.

16:13.720 --> 16:19.560
You have at most one option, supposing the woke win, and that's to sell out completely,

16:19.560 --> 16:23.320
to have nothing authentic left about yourself.

16:23.320 --> 16:28.540
The only place you will have a future is inside the most corrupt megacorporate sector that

16:28.540 --> 16:35.020
is our new western Soviet, a council of stakeholders that knows the science of right human relations

16:35.020 --> 16:40.580
and holds the keys to sustainable development in a circular economy.

16:40.580 --> 16:45.300
If it supports trans rights and reducing emissions today, you will support those things.

16:45.300 --> 16:49.780
If it changes its mind tomorrow for the glory of the new system, so will you, or you will

16:49.780 --> 16:51.580
be eliminated.

16:51.580 --> 16:57.920
Your only path to success inside the system you advocate for is to become a hollow, soulless

16:57.920 --> 17:03.120
functionary, an aphistic megacorporate and or governmental public-private partnership

17:03.120 --> 17:04.880
machine.

17:04.880 --> 17:10.040
Your only path to success outside of this system is to abandon this activism as soon

17:10.040 --> 17:17.840
as possible and start healing yourself psychologically, emotionally, and educationally.

17:17.840 --> 17:23.340
Your fate, if the woke system wins, is to be disposed of or hollowed out, and use as

17:23.340 --> 17:28.020
a functionary of its changing whims, and this should have little appeal to you.

17:28.020 --> 17:32.380
It certainly won't bring about justice or satisfaction, and it won't allow you to be

17:32.380 --> 17:35.940
a prosperous individual or an individual at all.

17:35.940 --> 17:40.220
Your false prosperity will be available in direct proportion to your inauthenticity and

17:40.220 --> 17:45.020
corruptibility, the markers of your true utility to the machine you don't seem to realize

17:45.040 --> 17:47.400
you're supporting.

17:47.400 --> 17:50.640
There's no you on the other side of this.

17:50.640 --> 17:55.840
On the other hand, your fate, if the woke system loses, is a hard life that's made easier

17:55.840 --> 18:02.080
only by repenting of these errors and working to correct them, and the sooner the better.

18:02.080 --> 18:06.120
Already employers throughout the West increasingly suspect that if you even have a college degree

18:06.120 --> 18:11.920
at all, you're probably woke, radically leftist, entitled, unlikely to work hard, likely to

18:11.940 --> 18:17.500
create a hostile working environment, underskilled or unskilled, and likely to sue if you're

18:17.500 --> 18:21.100
fired even on perfectly solid and reasonable grounds.

18:21.100 --> 18:23.700
They have every reason to believe this.

18:23.700 --> 18:28.460
That makes you very, very unattractive.

18:28.460 --> 18:31.260
If you are woke, they know it's true.

18:31.260 --> 18:35.900
You actually are a liability to them, and many of them are only still hiring you today

18:35.900 --> 18:37.660
because they have to.

18:37.660 --> 18:41.380
To keep their place in the corrupt corporate scoring schemes that control the way business

18:41.400 --> 18:43.640
is done now in the West.

18:43.640 --> 18:48.960
So you're either unhireable or hireable only as an asset to satisfy the ESG demands of

18:48.960 --> 18:53.400
a sprawling corrupt bureaucracy.

18:53.400 --> 18:56.240
Isn't that great?

18:56.240 --> 18:57.760
And what happens if it gives way?

18:57.760 --> 18:58.760
Who are you?

18:58.760 --> 19:03.880
And if you help it succeed and participate in it, what are you?

19:03.880 --> 19:06.480
So the question is why you?

19:06.480 --> 19:07.560
Why not somebody else?

19:07.560 --> 19:08.560
Why now?

19:08.560 --> 19:09.560
Why you?

19:10.540 --> 19:15.580
Because you happen to be at the age you are at the worst time in Western history to be

19:15.580 --> 19:17.140
the age you are.

19:17.140 --> 19:19.300
That's it.

19:19.300 --> 19:23.460
Because many of you come from wealth and status and other resources the system covets and

19:23.460 --> 19:25.260
requires to succeed.

19:25.260 --> 19:32.220
You see, they're not really against privilege in the woke Marxist movement.

19:32.220 --> 19:34.220
They actually really like privilege.

19:34.220 --> 19:39.180
They just want to seize it and redistribute it and repurpose it to their ends.

19:39.180 --> 19:40.840
You are a resource to them.

19:40.840 --> 19:42.320
They need those resources.

19:42.320 --> 19:44.240
They need your enthusiasm and your zeal.

19:44.240 --> 19:45.760
They need your talent.

19:45.760 --> 19:48.960
They need your impressionable minds.

19:48.960 --> 19:53.640
They need the future citizens and the future leaders of the world.

19:53.640 --> 19:58.520
But you must remember, history uses people and then discards them.

19:58.520 --> 20:04.640
So they won't need you for long and they'll only need you for specific purposes.

20:04.640 --> 20:09.940
Then you will either be corrected or discarded, unless you choose to come off worse by selling

20:09.940 --> 20:10.940
out.

20:10.940 --> 20:16.080
So my message to you about the woke Marxist movement is simple.

20:16.080 --> 20:18.660
You need to know what you're really involved in.

20:18.660 --> 20:22.940
Stop participating, deprogram yourself and your friends and start fighting for the blessings

20:22.940 --> 20:27.780
of liberty that allowed you to have the privilege to think this way in the first place.

20:27.780 --> 20:29.700
You can and might lose it.

20:30.240 --> 20:35.000
You're the first generations in American history to face the loss of liberty.

20:35.000 --> 20:41.560
But if you do, if you support the woke movement, you do so by enslaving yourselves.

20:41.560 --> 20:46.600
You have been sold a false promise of liberation in place of liberty and you need to realize

20:46.600 --> 20:49.620
that you're being scammed.

20:49.620 --> 20:52.160
Liberation movements are lies.

20:52.160 --> 20:57.400
Mao called his army the same one he dispatched to destroy your counterparts in the Red Guard,

20:57.400 --> 21:02.420
the People's Liberation Army, and he called it that for a reason.

21:02.420 --> 21:05.060
Liberation is a lie.

21:05.060 --> 21:11.060
The oldest recorded cautionary tale in human history is the story of the serpent and Eve

21:11.060 --> 21:16.360
in the third chapter of Genesis, and it warns about this specifically.

21:16.360 --> 21:22.300
It warns humanity about liberation, and you can understand that message whether you are

21:22.300 --> 21:24.820
religious or not.

21:24.820 --> 21:27.240
Liberation is a destructive lie.

21:27.240 --> 21:31.620
We cannot liberate ourselves from the truth or from reality.

21:31.620 --> 21:36.420
If you liberate yourself from a free society, you end up in a tyranny.

21:36.420 --> 21:38.520
You need to fight for liberty.

21:38.520 --> 21:43.500
You think you are in chains, but your chains have been forged by frauds and are locked

21:43.500 --> 21:46.220
only in your heads.

21:46.220 --> 21:47.820
You are the future.

21:47.820 --> 21:49.940
Your choices matter.

21:49.940 --> 21:50.940
Choose better.
