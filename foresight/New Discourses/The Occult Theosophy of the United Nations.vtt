00:00.000 --> 00:24.400
Hey everybody, it's James Lindsay. You're listening to the New Discourses podcast, and in particular

00:24.400 --> 00:29.040
you're listening to another long weird episode of the New Discourses podcast because we're going

00:29.040 --> 00:36.160
to talk about something weird yet again in rather tremendous depth. We're going to talk about the

00:36.160 --> 00:41.440
United Nations. And a matter of fact, what we're going to talk about is there was a United Nations

00:41.440 --> 00:48.000
character, I'll kind of spell this out in a minute named Robert Mueller, and in the 2000 days leading

00:48.000 --> 00:57.600
up to the year 2000. So the 2000 days leading up to January 1st, 2000, Robert Mueller, who was by

00:57.600 --> 01:07.120
no means a small player in the United Nations pantheon, laid out what he called 2000 ideas and

01:07.120 --> 01:13.680
dreams for a better world, or sometimes he referred to it as 2000 ideas, or 2000 ideas for the year

01:13.680 --> 01:21.440
2000. And in essence, he was laying out ideas and dreams like kind of his just thoughts, 2000 of

01:21.440 --> 01:25.440
them as a matter of fact, for the direction that the United Nations should take and the role it

01:25.440 --> 01:31.040
should play in the world in the 21st century. And the point of this podcast is to tell you some

01:31.040 --> 01:35.360
of what he said, and so that we can realize that the direction of the United Nations, whatever

01:35.360 --> 01:40.880
the United Nations was intended to be from its origins, and since it originated with the Huxleys,

01:41.920 --> 01:46.880
I don't think it was necessarily ever meant to be a good organization. I think it's always had

01:46.880 --> 01:54.240
theosophical roots, but it is unambiguous in these documents that Robert Mueller, and I'll tell you

01:54.240 --> 01:58.960
who he is in a second, you know who he is, you just don't realize you know who he is. He's not the

01:58.960 --> 02:04.000
guy that prosecuted Trump. That's a different Robert Mueller, or I should say, investigated

02:04.000 --> 02:08.560
Trump. It's spelled differently. They're not the same guy. But you've heard of him before.

02:10.160 --> 02:15.520
It's unambiguous in these documents that Robert Mueller wanted the United Nations to reconstitute

02:15.520 --> 02:21.520
itself for the 21st century, that he wasn't satisfied with how theosophical the United Nations

02:21.520 --> 02:25.600
was in the 20th century, and he wanted it to reconstitute itself as an explicitly

02:26.160 --> 02:31.040
very theosophical organization going into the 21st century. So he delivers this in the late

02:32.640 --> 02:40.400
1999, I should specify, to the UN Secretary General at the time and urges him to read these,

02:40.400 --> 02:48.080
and he actually, the document I'm pulling from is a small document that he sent specifically to

02:48.080 --> 02:52.640
the Secretary General to pay attention to, which is a condensation. So the way Robert Mueller

02:52.640 --> 02:58.240
published 2000 ideas and dreams for a better world, or 2000 ideas for the year 2000,

02:58.960 --> 03:05.520
was in four volumes. I'll make all four volumes are on his website, Robert Mueller.org. I'll make

03:05.520 --> 03:12.240
those available in links to this so you can go see all 2000 ideas if you want. He said he was

03:12.240 --> 03:17.440
going to write 3000 ideas because the plans were meant to extend to the year 3000 for the United

03:17.440 --> 03:24.560
Nations, but I don't know if the other 1000 ever got written. I haven't looked that deeply into it

03:24.560 --> 03:30.720
yet, but he wrote this condensed version where he wrote 59 pages of the ones that he thought was

03:30.720 --> 03:36.320
more most important in the realm of spiritual direction that the UN should take in world

03:36.320 --> 03:40.960
leadership, including of course, a one world government headquartered through the United

03:40.960 --> 03:45.600
Nations or coordinated through the United Nations. And it's kind of creepy how much of it seems to

03:45.600 --> 03:51.360
fit with what we're dealing with, because this is straight occult theosophy guiding the ship of

03:51.360 --> 03:56.400
the United Nations, which means the United Nations, whatever it started as, and like I said, I don't

03:56.400 --> 04:02.160
think it started good. I think it's always been an occult theosophical organization, and I think

04:02.160 --> 04:06.640
there are reasons to believe that that's true, some of which I've discussed before, like in the

04:06.640 --> 04:16.560
WTF is SEL podcast. Certainly for the last two decades, since I will say specifically 2003,

04:16.560 --> 04:23.120
it has been oriented toward a transformational project, and that transformational project is

04:23.120 --> 04:27.520
rooted in occult theosophy. So it's not a good organization. It's not a neutral organization.

04:27.520 --> 04:33.600
It's not even really a governing organization. It is an occult organization. It is a best you

04:33.600 --> 04:40.320
could say is really weird organization. Worst you could say is that it's genuinely an evil

04:40.320 --> 04:45.680
organization. And I think that we, this is all very positive the way that Robert Mueller wrote

04:45.680 --> 04:49.600
this, but I think that we're going to come away understanding that. And because this is going

04:49.600 --> 04:55.360
to be really long, I've set aside almost 10,000 words of his writing to explore. I want to just

04:55.360 --> 05:01.920
kind of dive in and not preamble too much, but we got to start with who is Robert Mueller.

05:01.920 --> 05:07.040
So Robert Mueller worked at the United Nations. It's M-U-L-L-E-R. It's not, again, the same guy

05:07.040 --> 05:11.680
who investigated Trump. That's a different Robert Mueller, spelled differently. He worked at the

05:11.680 --> 05:16.640
United Nations for over 40 years. He was at one time the assistant secretary general, so he was

05:16.640 --> 05:22.240
very high up. He was very well respected. He was very well networked throughout the United Nations

05:22.240 --> 05:27.520
through much of that long career. But more importantly, and this is where you've heard

05:27.520 --> 05:33.360
of him before, is he's the guy who developed the World Core Curriculum, which was meant to be

05:33.360 --> 05:42.560
a new education method for the entire planet, according to a set of core curriculum points

05:42.560 --> 05:47.520
that were going to be core to the entire world's education program. In the United States, that

05:47.520 --> 05:55.120
became Common Core. So Common Core was created slightly indirectly, but basically by Robert

05:55.120 --> 06:02.320
Mueller at the United Nations. Now, I introduced that concept to you previously. In the very long

06:02.320 --> 06:08.720
WTF is SEL. What the F is, Social Emotional Learning Podcasts that I did some time ago,

06:08.720 --> 06:14.000
where I pointed out that Robert Mueller's ideas were, in fact, strongly influenced by

06:14.000 --> 06:20.320
the occult theosophist who created the Lucifer publishing company named Alice Bailey. His ideas

06:20.400 --> 06:25.840
about education were inspired by an an occult theosophist named Alice Bailey. Now, the point of

06:25.840 --> 06:30.880
that podcast wasn't to talk about Common Core and its origins or Robert Mueller, it was just kind of a

06:31.760 --> 06:35.680
sidebar. The point was to talk about Social Emotional Learning and its development at the

06:35.680 --> 06:40.400
Fedser Institute. Now, I want to remind you, by the way, so far as these two programs go,

06:40.400 --> 06:44.640
Social Emotional Learning and Common Core, both of which, both of these were very heavily funded

06:44.640 --> 06:48.880
by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation gave hundreds of

06:48.880 --> 06:54.480
millions of dollars to pushing the Common Core or the World Core curriculum into the United States,

06:54.480 --> 06:59.680
but that wasn't enough. And when Common Core kind of started to falter and it got replaced with

06:59.680 --> 07:06.640
Social Emotional Learning starting in 2015 and 16, Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation has dumped

07:06.640 --> 07:12.560
possibly up to two billion dollars into pushing that. But the point is that they're both based in

07:12.560 --> 07:20.480
the same occult theosophy, deriving from the rantings of Alice Bailey and others. But Robert

07:20.480 --> 07:25.440
Mueller was no small player. Like I said, he was Assistant Secretary General of the United Nations

07:25.440 --> 07:30.080
for a while. He was named the Chancellor of the United Nations University for Peace, which is

07:30.080 --> 07:36.800
headquartered in Costa Rica. He talks about this. He also organized a group you haven't heard about

07:36.800 --> 07:41.600
yet, but you're going to need to hear about, which is called the Evolutionary Leaders. Who are the

07:41.600 --> 07:46.640
Evolutionary Leaders? Well, they're a bunch of theosophical occult weirdos who believe in something

07:46.640 --> 07:52.000
that is called the New Thought Movement or New Thought Religion. I would say it's the Gnostic

07:52.000 --> 07:58.800
New Thought Movement, because it is a Gnostic and Hermetic kind of spin-off cult. It has roots tied

07:58.800 --> 08:03.280
back to, I know I've talked about this briefly in the past with some of the Gnosticism and Hermeticism

08:03.280 --> 08:09.120
podcasts, has roots tied back into the Kabalian, which is probably written by this guy Atchkinson.

08:09.120 --> 08:14.400
I always say his name a little bit messed up. I got to work on that. And so this is like legit,

08:14.400 --> 08:21.040
legit, theosophical, I would say New Age, but the name of it's actually New Thought. And then

08:21.040 --> 08:26.000
it's a Gnostic approach. It's a Gnostic religion. And their goal is to make a Gnostic One World

08:26.000 --> 08:33.440
Religion that's the one religion in the world that's coordinated and interwoven with the governments,

08:33.440 --> 08:40.080
a world government through the United Nations. And you would be very familiar if you are a daytime

08:40.080 --> 08:46.880
TV aficionado from the 90s and early 2000s, with lots of the evolutionary leaders, even though you

08:46.880 --> 08:51.440
didn't know you're familiar with them, because Oprah Winfrey has platformed every single one of them.

08:52.400 --> 08:58.640
The so-called New Age stuff, which is all occult theosophy, that Oprah Winfrey and her

08:58.640 --> 09:04.800
book club mainlined into middle-class moms and primarily their daughters and somewhat their sons

09:05.840 --> 09:13.200
for the last several, you know, decades, is all Gnostic New Thought. And the New Thought movement

09:13.200 --> 09:17.760
itself, by the way, has been recognized as a world religion now. It's not recognized in the

09:17.760 --> 09:25.680
United States specifically as a religion, but it is recognized as a world religion

09:25.680 --> 09:31.680
by the international body that certifies these things. So I want to thank particularly Lisa

09:31.680 --> 09:37.360
Logan for showing me this. I mean, I wasn't digging into Robert Mueller, I probably should have been,

09:37.360 --> 09:42.960
but she started to, and she showed me this, and she's helped me understand and link out all the

09:42.960 --> 09:48.240
connections between Robert Mueller and the United Nations to the evolutionary leaders, which she's

09:48.240 --> 09:52.960
researching tremendously right now, and to the Gnostic New Thought movement, which she's

09:53.040 --> 09:58.240
researching right now. And she got into chasing all this down basically by pursuing the Alice

09:58.240 --> 10:02.800
Bailey stuff that we were talking about about a year ago, and so a little over a year ago now,

10:02.800 --> 10:09.040
like a year and a half ago. So this is deep and dark stuff, and I'm barely skimming the surface

10:09.040 --> 10:14.400
of it. And I really want to thank Lisa Logan for all the work she's doing and for bringing this to

10:14.400 --> 10:17.360
my attention so that I can bring it to your attention. But if you really want to want the

10:17.360 --> 10:20.880
deep dives on this, she's already been putting some of it out, and she's going to be putting a

10:20.880 --> 10:24.480
lot more of it out, she's going to really expose this. You need to go follow and pay attention

10:24.480 --> 10:29.360
to Lisa Logan. So she's at I Am Lisa Logan. Everything's spelled the way you think it is.

10:30.160 --> 10:35.680
That's on the X, and you can figure her out further from there. She's doing an amazing job

10:35.680 --> 10:41.280
digging this stuff up and making us understand it. So she sent me this condensed document that is

10:41.280 --> 10:48.480
59 pages of a summary for 2000 ideas and dreams for a better world. And I have stuck to that

10:48.480 --> 10:52.480
document, even though when you go read the all 2000 of the ideas, like there are some other

10:52.480 --> 10:57.680
ones that are so insane that it was super hard not to add them. It's very hard not to read basically

10:57.680 --> 11:02.960
all of this, which would take like weeks of podcasts to get through all of it. There's 2000

11:02.960 --> 11:12.960
of them. But anyway, this document was originally published and sent with its full reply on March

11:12.960 --> 11:20.080
17, 1999. It says it begins with a handful of letters back and forth between Robert Muller

11:20.080 --> 11:26.320
and the Office of the Secretary General of the United Nations. And it says, Dear Robert,

11:26.320 --> 11:32.000
your thoughtful letter and book ideas and dreams for a better world arrived. The Secretary General

11:32.000 --> 11:36.720
wishes to thank you for the dedication and inspiration you continue to give to the cause of

11:36.720 --> 11:43.440
peace, justice, and freedom. Your dynamic and eloquent leadership gives you courage or sorry,

11:43.440 --> 11:48.720
gives courage to so many who share our goals. The Secretary General looks forward to reading

11:48.720 --> 11:54.640
your book with care and ask that I convey your views to other officials. So why I included this

11:54.640 --> 12:00.640
little letter reply from the beginning is to frame who Robert Muller is. He's a very important

12:00.640 --> 12:06.640
character. The Secretary General has a direct correspondence with him. He wishes to thank

12:06.640 --> 12:14.480
Robert Muller for his dedication and inspiration. And he can he applauds Robert Muller's dynamic

12:14.480 --> 12:21.360
and eloquent leadership. And in particular, though, this is what he says is that he this dynamic and

12:21.360 --> 12:27.280
eloquent leadership gives courage. And I quote to so many who share our goals. Well, what are those

12:27.280 --> 12:33.360
goals? This is an occult theosophy document. As you're going to hear, what are the goals of the

12:33.360 --> 12:38.240
United Nations? That's the question that this really raises. And I want to point out, it says,

12:38.240 --> 12:42.320
the Secretary General looks forward to reading your book with care and ask that I convey your

12:42.320 --> 12:48.560
views to other officials. So this is in March, 1999, March 17, 1999. As a matter of fact,

12:49.440 --> 12:55.520
my thought is, almost all of this horrific stuff, whether it's ESG, guess what year that was created

12:55.520 --> 13:01.520
2003. Comprehensive Sexuality Education, 2003. A bunch of the other UNESCO and UN initiatives

13:01.520 --> 13:06.960
that are actually shaping the global agenda that we're all getting put through right now,

13:06.960 --> 13:13.680
all started in 2003, which is a few years down the road from this. Did this inform those? That's a

13:13.680 --> 13:19.520
legitimate question at this point. The reorganization and kind of pedal to the metal of the United

13:19.520 --> 13:23.840
Nations, which at the time would have been pushing agenda 21. So what's the relevance of the timing?

13:23.920 --> 13:29.600
The idea was that by the year 2021, which did not succeed, that we would enter into a new world.

13:29.600 --> 13:34.000
That was the idea of agenda 21. And it was based off of what we're called the Millennium Development

13:34.000 --> 13:38.880
Goals, which preceded the Sustainable Development Goals. Okay. And there were eight of those,

13:38.880 --> 13:42.880
there are 17 Sustainable Development Goals, I will remind you with their magic number 17.

13:44.000 --> 13:50.800
So I'm strongly suspicious that the reason that it all started in 2003,

13:50.800 --> 13:56.320
and this goes 2003 plus 17 is 2020. So they have a 17 year long cycle in order to try to

13:57.360 --> 14:04.800
implement agenda 21 so that the new world starts on, it starts in, I don't know what date they

14:04.800 --> 14:10.240
would have picked specifically within the year, but in 2021. Much like we're supposed to have a

14:10.240 --> 14:16.000
new world now as they delayed it and pushed it back in 2030. That's why they call it the 17

14:16.000 --> 14:23.280
Sustainable Development Goals are for 2030. It's literally called agenda 2030. People want to say

14:23.280 --> 14:27.760
you're a conspiracy theorist, is it a conspiracy? If it's like literally an agenda, wouldn't the

14:27.760 --> 14:31.840
people be working on the agenda? Wouldn't the secretary general looks forward to reading your

14:31.840 --> 14:36.320
book with care and ask that I convey your views to other officials because it gives leaders,

14:36.320 --> 14:40.480
or sorry, it gives courage to so many who share our goals. Well, what the hell are those goals?

14:40.480 --> 14:45.360
Well, let's dive into this and see what some of this book says. But first, let me give you

14:45.360 --> 14:51.680
some context, because the next thing in the document that was published here that I have

14:51.680 --> 14:56.000
is that Robert Mueller, this is the response to Robert Mueller's letter, Robert Mueller then

14:56.000 --> 15:02.160
includes his own letter that he sent. I'm not going to read all of it, obviously. And this isn't

15:02.160 --> 15:07.840
the excerpts from the book. This is just the cover letter. And he sent that on March 6. So

15:07.920 --> 15:15.120
again, just to underline how what a deal this guy is, Robert Mueller sent this on March 6,

15:15.120 --> 15:21.680
1999. And 11 days later, and I'm not common claiming some numerology to that, 11 days later,

15:21.680 --> 15:25.840
he had a response saying that it was going to be disseminated through the secretary general of the

15:25.840 --> 15:30.640
UN and other people. So he's a very influential character. So his letter, Robert Mueller's letter,

15:30.640 --> 15:35.920
this is Robert Mueller, starts off this way. Dear Mr. Secretary General, with the year 2000,

15:35.920 --> 15:42.960
you are becoming the most important person on earth in the entire human history. How can you

15:42.960 --> 15:50.320
face this overwhelming challenge in one of the most complex and messy human, earth, and evolutionary

15:50.320 --> 15:57.440
situations this planet has ever known? Well, here are a few advices from a lifetime world

15:57.440 --> 16:02.640
public servant and direct aid to three former secretaries general. I'm not going to read all

16:02.640 --> 16:08.480
these advices, which are mostly a reminder to the secretary general of his power and his importance

16:08.480 --> 16:14.880
as what's called the Millennium Assembly for the year 2000 was approaching. So what was this

16:14.880 --> 16:21.200
power and importance? Obviously, you are becoming the most important person on earth in the entire

16:21.200 --> 16:29.120
human history because of the year 2000 is what Mueller said to the guy. And in terms of what

16:29.120 --> 16:36.240
the complex, messy human, earth, and evolutionary situations, the most complex ones that the earth

16:36.240 --> 16:42.400
has ever known. And so he's reminding him of his power in terms of getting all of the world's

16:42.400 --> 16:48.720
leaders on the same page as their agenda. And so that's what that's what the advices are really

16:48.720 --> 16:52.320
about. You need to wake up in the morning and look at yourself and realize how important your job is.

16:52.320 --> 16:56.320
You need to get the other world leaders on board with what we're doing. We need as many of them as

16:56.320 --> 17:00.400
possible. That's your role. We have to prepare for the Millennium Assembly. That's the kind of

17:00.400 --> 17:05.920
advices that are there. And I'm laughing that he called it advices, plural instead of advice.

17:06.880 --> 17:11.760
So then after indicating that the secretary general should have all of his officers read all

17:11.760 --> 17:18.880
four volumes of this 2000 ideas, and to incorporate as many of them are useful into the Millennium

17:18.880 --> 17:24.960
Assembly, which is supposed to set the trajectory for the United Nations in the new millennium. So

17:24.960 --> 17:30.480
in some sense, not just for the 21st century, but all the way to the year 3000, presuming like I

17:30.480 --> 17:34.800
told you a minute ago that Robert Mueller believed that there would be UN global governance till

17:34.800 --> 17:44.320
the year 3000, a millennium of this tyranny. After urging that all the officers read this 2000 ideas

17:44.320 --> 17:49.760
book that I'm going to share from, he then notes that the purpose of this particular document that

17:49.760 --> 17:56.400
he's sending, which is an excerpt from the four volumes, is to relay 59 pages of the ideas that

17:56.400 --> 18:02.080
he wrote in 2000 ideas that are pertinent to a global religious movement. And I'm telling you,

18:02.080 --> 18:05.760
it's a cult theosophy. And that's what we're going to focus on. In fact, we're going to focus hard

18:05.760 --> 18:10.880
on that one magic word there, evolutionary. Because that's what these people think that

18:10.880 --> 18:14.320
they're doing. And like I said, Robert Mueller organized a group that are called the evolutionary

18:14.320 --> 18:19.360
leaders that believe that they're going to be able to direct the spiritual evolution of man

18:19.360 --> 18:24.720
in the correct direction. Now, I will point out that theosophists throughout history have believed

18:24.720 --> 18:30.000
this. The Gnostics believed this. The ancient Hermeticists believe this. Karl Marx believed

18:30.000 --> 18:34.320
this. The point of seizing the means of economic production was that Karl Marx believed that the

18:34.320 --> 18:39.840
means of economic production produced economic conditions. And economic conditions produced

18:39.840 --> 18:45.520
people. It produced who you were. So if you seize and transform the means of economic production,

18:45.520 --> 18:51.440
you seize the means of producing man to be different. In fact, to become socialist or

18:51.440 --> 18:57.920
eventually communist, ideally, which is a spiritual evolution because Marx's idea is that communism

18:57.920 --> 19:03.920
in its true form is the, in his words, positive transcendence of private property as human

19:03.920 --> 19:09.520
self-estrangement. So in other words, it is a Marx believed that we're going to seize the means of

19:09.520 --> 19:19.600
production of man so that we transcend our fallen form of private property owning individuals.

19:19.600 --> 19:26.080
We're going to go back into a unified social and creative entity, mass entity, collective entity,

19:26.080 --> 19:32.000
where we are our own creators, direct our own evolution. And the end point of that evolution

19:32.000 --> 19:39.280
is this liberated communist utopia. And this isn't that far off. This is a another branch

19:39.280 --> 19:44.640
on the same tree. I'm not calling this guy a Marxist. I don't think he is. I think he's another

19:44.640 --> 19:51.040
branch on the same theosophical tree. That's what this document is actually about is

19:52.240 --> 19:58.720
communicating 59 pages worth of these crackpot ideas. And I had to do some work to select down

19:58.720 --> 20:04.080
to just staying under 10,000 words of them pertinent to a global religious movement.

20:04.640 --> 20:10.960
And that global religious movement's purpose is to direct the future evolution of man. There's

20:10.960 --> 20:19.440
a word for that. It's called eugenics. Evolutionary leaders could be called eugenics leaders very

20:19.440 --> 20:25.120
easily. It's like a rebrand to hide what they really are. But I want to stress that the goal

20:25.120 --> 20:30.240
is not whether it's communism, whether it's new thought, the goal, whether it's Margaret Sanger's

20:30.240 --> 20:35.440
Planned Parenthood, which is another branch on this same tree. The goal is not and Alice Bailey

20:35.440 --> 20:40.880
made this very clear. And I talked about this in the WTF is SEL podcast as well about Alice Bailey.

20:40.880 --> 20:48.240
The goal is not to direct the physical evolution of man. So so much to say Alice Bailey called that

20:48.240 --> 20:55.760
exoteric eugenics and said it's not good. It's to direct the spiritual evolution of man, which is

20:56.480 --> 21:01.920
of course co constituted or intrinsically interwoven with the physical evolution of man.

21:01.920 --> 21:06.880
So the goal is actually to direct man on a spiritual level, but we have to work with the

21:06.880 --> 21:13.520
crude means that we have. In other words, as above so below, so the spiritual level of man

21:14.000 --> 21:21.520
imprints on his physical form and as below so above. So we work with the physical forms. We work

21:21.520 --> 21:28.160
with physical things to direct the spiritual evolution as below so above. And when that happens,

21:28.160 --> 21:33.280
just like Karl Marx believed in the cycle of man creates society, creates man, creates society,

21:34.000 --> 21:38.880
here we have the idea that we're going to direct the consciousness of man until the

21:38.880 --> 21:44.320
consciousness of man changes spiritual evolution. And that will cause a new man to arise who's more

21:44.320 --> 21:48.880
in line with that level of spirituality. And their goal is to push us into a new age,

21:49.920 --> 21:55.040
which just so happens to be under their control. Because of their global world, I want to say

21:55.040 --> 21:59.440
religion that there's the word they're kind of using it, but it's a cult. This is the largest

21:59.440 --> 22:04.080
cult startup in the history of the world. And ultimately, the theosophical religions across

22:04.080 --> 22:11.840
the board all have the exact same idea that the fundamental human right is to be back in the

22:11.840 --> 22:18.240
Garden of Eden. We have a fundamental right to a liberated utopia. So when you hear them talk about

22:18.240 --> 22:23.280
our human rights or whatever, then you say, well, they just seem to make up a new right like every

22:23.280 --> 22:28.320
other day. This is right. That's right. Everything's an intrinsic right. What they believe is that they

22:28.320 --> 22:34.640
have an intrinsic right to live in utopia. And literally, it's to, if we go kind of deeper into

22:34.640 --> 22:42.240
the old theosophical religions, that to re-enter into the Garden of Eden, that the God that kicked

22:42.240 --> 22:47.920
us out is some kind of an evil demagogic being, or it's a result of a cosmic negative accident that

22:47.920 --> 22:54.560
kicked us out of our inheritance in the perfected utopia of Eden. And that we have an inalienable

22:54.560 --> 23:02.960
right to live in Eden that we have been alienated from because of a cruel and wicked circumstance

23:02.960 --> 23:10.320
of whatever caused us to fall in the past. It was the serpent luring us to eat the fruit of the tree

23:10.320 --> 23:16.480
of the knowledge of good and evil, and then God kicked us out, which is characterized as an evil

23:16.480 --> 23:23.040
act and proof that the God portrayed in Genesis as a demon, or with Marx as the advent of private

23:23.040 --> 23:28.640
property and the individualism that follows from it. With the queer theory, it would be the advent of

23:28.640 --> 23:34.160
people believing they can define what it means to be normal for a human being, and thus falling into

23:34.160 --> 23:39.520
the same kind of situation and estranging one another. But their belief is that we have a

23:39.520 --> 23:45.360
fundamental inalienable right to re-enter the Garden of Eden. And that happens by advancing our

23:45.360 --> 23:54.320
spiritual and collective societal human evolution into the direction indicated by their religious

23:54.320 --> 24:00.560
crack pottery. So like I said, it is the largest cult startup in the history of the world. And my

24:00.560 --> 24:05.840
essential claim, just to put it very bluntly in this podcast, is that at least in this century,

24:05.840 --> 24:11.360
so at least for the last two decades and maybe a little more, the United Nations has been

24:11.360 --> 24:18.400
devoted to this goal and has been devoted to being the headquarters for this cult movement,

24:18.400 --> 24:22.080
with all of its power, all of its extensions. And so there's no reason that we should be

24:22.080 --> 24:28.480
participating in the United Nations whatsoever. It is a cult theosophical organization. That's

24:28.480 --> 24:34.480
my hypothesis. So just another snippet from Muller, before we get down to these ideas, he says,

24:34.480 --> 24:39.920
with Dr. Karen Singh of India, we have just created a world commission on global consciousness and

24:39.920 --> 24:47.120
spirituality to promote a much needed spiritual renaissance. That's the goal of this document.

24:47.120 --> 24:52.320
That's the goal of what the United Nations was setting up around the year 2000, up to 2003,

24:52.320 --> 24:57.680
when they started pushing all of this stuff. He says, I'm sending other members an excerpt of

24:57.680 --> 25:03.760
59 pages of ideas regarding religion and spirituality similar to the one on the future and

25:03.760 --> 25:10.320
futures capitalized here. So that's this document. That's the 59 pages. This document is the 59 pages

25:10.320 --> 25:15.520
of what Robert Muller thinks the United Nations needs to understand about religion and spirituality

25:15.520 --> 25:20.160
and what it should look like in the 21st century and actually in the entire third millennium.

25:20.160 --> 25:24.480
And it's all connected to something that they call their world commission on global consciousness

25:24.480 --> 25:29.600
and spirituality. There's that consciousness word. That's a theosophical tell that there's

25:29.600 --> 25:34.320
some secret consciousness that you awaken to that if you don't have it, you're basically like cattle.

25:35.120 --> 25:42.480
And this document is meant to be issued in pursuit of a, quote, much needed spiritual renaissance.

25:43.760 --> 25:49.840
Like I said, he then goes on to note that he says, these are Robert Muller's 2000 ideas

25:49.840 --> 25:57.920
started on 11 July 1994, 2000 days before 1 January 2000. So I'd only bring it up because

25:57.920 --> 26:04.560
I want to point out to you how invested they are in symbolism. It's not a hard calculation,

26:04.560 --> 26:08.560
but it's a calculation. You have to sit down and very intentionally decide to figure out which

26:08.560 --> 26:16.480
day on the calendar is 2000 days before January 1, 2000. And that day happened to work out

26:16.480 --> 26:24.320
mathematically to July 11, 1994. And that was the day he decided to start writing 2000 ideas

26:24.320 --> 26:28.800
for the 21st century. He didn't write one idea a day, even though that seems to be it.

26:28.800 --> 26:33.440
He wrote on average one idea per day, but he also is proud that he finished a little bit

26:33.440 --> 26:39.840
early. And that's why he was able to submit this on the 6th of March 1999 instead of having to wait

26:39.840 --> 26:44.960
until, you know, December or something. And so this document I'm about to read from is exactly

26:44.960 --> 26:50.160
what Muller indicates. It's 59 pages totaling perhaps a couple hundred of these 2000 ideas

26:50.160 --> 26:54.560
that he considers specifically essential to a spiritual renaissance for the world,

26:54.560 --> 27:00.560
meant to be facilitated and coordinated into a single world religion through the United Nations.

27:00.560 --> 27:04.960
I am not going to read all of the ideas, all the few hundred ideas in this, I'm not going to read

27:04.960 --> 27:08.880
them in order either because that would bury the lead. Now I am burying the lead a little bit,

27:08.880 --> 27:12.960
but I want to give you a flavor of it. And we're going to, of course, build in the level of crazy.

27:12.960 --> 27:16.640
So stick with me. But I'm going to start with some of the ideas further down on the list.

27:17.600 --> 27:21.440
And then kind of return to some earlier ones with a couple of exceptions. I'm going to do

27:21.440 --> 27:25.920
a couple right from the very beginning, just to give you an idea, because it's again relevant

27:25.920 --> 27:30.960
to understanding who Robert Muller is and what much of his life work involved. And I just want

27:30.960 --> 27:37.360
you to keep in the back of your mind all along. This is the guy who created the education program

27:37.360 --> 27:45.600
that became Common Core. This is the guy who created Common Core. So idea 105 written on the

27:45.600 --> 27:53.680
23rd of October, 1994. For the sake of this planet and humanity's future, an office of global

27:53.680 --> 28:00.640
education should be created in every ministry of education. Global education should be required in

28:00.640 --> 28:06.960
all schools of earth, from kindergarten to university, and in all professional schools,

28:06.960 --> 28:12.640
especially for journalism and the media. So he understood very clearly that messaging

28:12.720 --> 28:18.880
apparatuses and schools, messaging apparatuses need to be captured through their schools,

28:18.880 --> 28:22.720
and he understood that schools themselves need to be turned into brainwashing apparatuses

28:22.720 --> 28:26.480
for his global education. And that's the Common Core program that he invented.

28:26.480 --> 28:32.400
So then that's idea 105, idea 103, which he wrote two days earlier on the 21st of October, 1994.

28:33.280 --> 28:39.040
While the exact sciences are all of a global universal nature, the social sciences are not.

28:39.040 --> 28:45.600
Now, reflecting what we just talked about with George Soros, who published the book Alchemy of

28:45.600 --> 28:51.440
Finance, arguing exactly the same thing two years before this. While the exact sciences are all of

28:51.440 --> 28:58.240
a global universal nature, the social sciences are not, there is urgent need for a global anthropology,

28:58.240 --> 29:06.080
global sociology, global psychology, global political science that he calls planetetics.

29:06.320 --> 29:13.440
Did I say that right? No, planetics, sorry, planetics, planet ICS, planetics, sorry,

29:14.240 --> 29:22.160
global literature, global art, global culture, global philosophy, global futurology, etc.

29:22.800 --> 29:29.360
Margaret Mead was the first prophet recommending it. Now, Margaret Mead is the anthropologist who

29:29.360 --> 29:35.680
went around and is basically the mother of cultural relativism, which is this kind of idea that

29:36.160 --> 29:41.440
matriculated strongly into the social sciences and in particular into the postmodern theory

29:42.000 --> 29:48.160
that says that no culture can judge one another. And this actually dovetails very nicely with these

29:48.800 --> 29:54.160
occult theosophical ideas, which is that there's exactly one religion, thus there's exactly one

29:54.160 --> 30:00.720
philosophy, there's exactly one science, there's exactly one faith, there's exactly one culture.

30:00.720 --> 30:06.800
And what that actually is, is what they called the Priska Theologia, the ancient theology, which

30:06.800 --> 30:15.280
is the occult theology that is frankly flat out denied by the Bible. So we're not looking in

30:15.280 --> 30:19.760
good directions here so far. So let me just give you, now that we've had a lot of preamble,

30:19.760 --> 30:26.240
throat clearing, etc., let me just give you the trigger warning, I guess, what is going to sound

30:26.240 --> 30:32.640
like an old 1950s TV show, or maybe unsolved mysteries from the 1980s. What you are about to

30:32.640 --> 30:38.560
hear will disturb you. It's true. What you're about to hear will actually probably disturb you.

30:38.560 --> 30:46.640
My only commentary then in setting out is, I want you to keep in mind, this is the real United

30:46.640 --> 30:51.200
Nations. When we look under the hood of the UN, this is what we're dealing with. Even with all

30:51.200 --> 30:57.840
the positive aspirational language, this is disturbing. This is a cult theosophy trying to

30:57.840 --> 31:05.360
create a world cult religion that we're all stuck inside. And it's, in fact, a transformational

31:05.360 --> 31:13.040
religion, a transmutational religion, a evolutionary religion. And so they mean to seize the means of

31:13.040 --> 31:19.920
human spiritual production and societal production, such that we will move into our next evolutionary

31:19.920 --> 31:25.520
phase. And that's the goal of the United Nations, at least in the 21st century and third millennium.

31:25.520 --> 31:29.440
So let's start with some stuff we generally already know about the UN and its agendas,

31:29.440 --> 31:35.040
so we don't overwhelm too quickly, so that we can kind of understand how to orient what we already

31:35.040 --> 31:39.440
know about the United Nations in terms of what Mueller is indicating is underneath those agendas,

31:39.440 --> 31:44.080
which is the occult theosophy that this podcast is about. So as a result, I'm going to start near

31:44.080 --> 31:51.680
the end of the document with idea 1912. The creation, he says, by the Rio de Janeiro Conference

31:51.680 --> 31:57.200
of an Earth Council, so we're all familiar that a lot of this environmental sustainability crap

31:57.200 --> 32:02.880
all got kicked off and coordinated at the Rio conference, the Earth Council, in 1992.

32:03.440 --> 32:08.880
So the creation of the Rio de Janeiro Conference of an Earth Council is a great step ahead in

32:08.880 --> 32:15.680
human history. One of its first tasks is to draft an Earth charter. An admirable text of that charter

32:15.680 --> 32:22.960
is now in circulation among non-governmental organizations, NGOs, for their comments. It

32:22.960 --> 32:29.600
opens a completely new chapter of world charters. So here's where the NGOs become the relevant bodies

32:29.600 --> 32:36.080
to push all of this crap. We also need a charter for the seas and oceans, a charter for outer space,

32:36.080 --> 32:40.960
for the air and atmosphere, for the world's waters, for mountain areas, and for arid zones,

32:40.960 --> 32:46.560
for the world's forestry covers, for the world's vegetation, for other species, for human settlements,

32:46.560 --> 32:54.080
etc. A vast new field of human philosophy, behavior, and future evolution has been opened,

32:54.080 --> 33:01.920
the fundamental rights of the Earth. So all of this sustainable crap follows straight from this,

33:02.640 --> 33:07.600
and you hear what they're after, governance of everything in a evolutionary,

33:07.600 --> 33:13.280
theosophical sense, governance of everything, the seas, the oceans, outer space, the air,

33:13.280 --> 33:21.520
the atmosphere, the water, mountains, deserts, forests, vegetation, all the species, human

33:21.520 --> 33:28.560
settlements, they want control over all of it. And we see exactly those kinds of things coming down

33:28.560 --> 33:34.000
the pike today. That's exactly what they're working with with this kind of new Earth charter.

33:35.600 --> 33:44.560
So idea 1930. The UN General Assembly 2000 at the heads of states level must absolutely measure

33:44.560 --> 33:50.720
up to its historical tasks and be remembered for its audacity and long-term views of the future.

33:51.280 --> 33:57.360
It should above all decide to embark on the writing of a constitution for proper Earth

33:57.440 --> 34:05.280
government. If it does not, future historians will not forgive its members. So in the year 2000,

34:05.280 --> 34:11.440
the United Nations General Assembly is tasked, at least in this idea, with embarking on the writing

34:11.440 --> 34:16.720
of a new constitution for proper Earth government. Which does what? What the previous thing said.

34:18.320 --> 34:23.840
It opens up a vast new field of human philosophy, behavior, and future evolution

34:23.840 --> 34:28.800
in the fundamental rights of the Earth. So the constitution, that's supposed to be for global

34:28.800 --> 34:34.240
government, that they're supposed to write in the year 2000, is designed to push the fundamental

34:34.240 --> 34:40.400
rights of the Earth. And he says if it does not, future historians will not forgive its members.

34:40.400 --> 34:44.240
Well, it turns out future historians are probably not going to forgive its members,

34:44.240 --> 34:51.920
but it's not because they did not. It's because they did. Idea 1931. At this stage of our evolution,

34:51.920 --> 34:57.920
the concept of completion and survival of, sorry, I messed that up. At this stage of our evolution,

34:57.920 --> 35:04.400
so let's let's frame our heads here. He's talking directly about our evolution. That means mankind's

35:04.400 --> 35:11.200
evolution. At this stage of our evolution, the concept of competition and survival of the fittest

35:11.200 --> 35:18.800
must be abandoned in favor of the concept of cooperation. Oh, hello Carl Marx. Hello all the

35:18.800 --> 35:27.520
theosophists. The world future evolution of the Earth and of humanity depends on it. Only

35:27.520 --> 35:34.960
cooperation will save the Earth and humanity. From now on, cooperation must be the supreme law of

35:34.960 --> 35:43.520
Earth and human survival. We must aim at a united Earth and nature. There's the seed right there

35:43.520 --> 35:48.240
for the 17 Sustainable Development Goals and how they operate. And he's not just calling for a global

35:48.240 --> 35:52.880
government to be set up through the United Nations and organized in line with extending the 1992 Rio

35:52.880 --> 36:00.640
de Janeiro Earth Council Accord, but that it must also direct the, I should say redirect, the mechanisms

36:00.640 --> 36:08.080
of evolution of humanity specifically. Never mind the laws of nature. Never mind nature's god. Never

36:08.080 --> 36:14.560
mind a biblical god for sure. It is now time for a whole new principle that just so happens to be

36:14.560 --> 36:21.840
cooperation, aka communism, but kind of elevated communism, above communism even. And I want to

36:21.840 --> 36:27.440
stress this point that this evolution is meant in a spiritual sense. The goal is to change the

36:27.440 --> 36:33.680
consciousness of man so that man behaves differently. And through changing consciousness and through

36:33.680 --> 36:40.720
changing how we behave, we become new people, a new species, a more advanced species. And in fact,

36:40.720 --> 36:44.560
we become a communal species. And that's very important. These evolutionary leaders that I

36:44.560 --> 36:50.160
mentioned before that he organized, this is very important because they actually see it that here's

36:50.160 --> 36:54.480
the idea. And I'm stealing from Lisa here. So this is going to be a little bit rough. Lisa Logan,

36:54.480 --> 36:59.520
again, I am Lisa Logan. You should go follow her. So the general idea is they say, well,

37:00.080 --> 37:06.160
look at what you have. You have these bacteria and the bacteria start to make colonies and groups

37:06.160 --> 37:09.520
and they group together. This is a real video. She'll show you the real video eventually. There's

37:09.520 --> 37:13.840
a real video I've seen of this guy given this lecture. So this isn't us riffing. There's also

37:13.840 --> 37:18.560
books explaining this. So the bacteria form, you know, various colonies or whatever. And some of

37:18.560 --> 37:22.000
the colonies figure out that if they share resources in certain ways, that they're more

37:22.000 --> 37:27.040
successful. And so they can now compete the other ones. So bacteria colonies, which are kind of

37:27.040 --> 37:32.800
communities of bacteria do better. And eventually, a thing called a biofilm can form around them so

37:32.800 --> 37:37.920
that the colony itself becomes sort of a single entity. And then the various different bacteria

37:37.920 --> 37:42.880
within it can specialize to do this or do that or do the other thing for the collective. And then

37:42.880 --> 37:46.960
what you end up with is something like an amoeba, you end up with a more complex organism. And that's

37:46.960 --> 37:51.760
one step in an evolutionary spiral that happens to look exactly like all the evolutionary hermetic

37:51.760 --> 37:56.800
spirals that I've put on Twitter over time, like they literally use the same graphic and

37:56.800 --> 38:01.280
outcomes a new species. And this is how evolutionary leaps to higher order creatures,

38:01.280 --> 38:06.400
they say are made. And so eventually amoebas form colonies or something that are like amoebas form

38:06.400 --> 38:10.640
colonies, and they get a biofilm, and then you have a more complex organism and on and up until

38:10.640 --> 38:14.000
you end up with animals, and then you end up with mammals, and then you end up with human beings.

38:14.000 --> 38:18.560
And so they think that we're at the stage. And this is the point of their evolutionary idea,

38:18.560 --> 38:24.320
where human beings themselves are ready to take the next evolutionary leap into a

38:24.320 --> 38:30.880
global collective. And the biofilm, we've already formed communities, but the biofilm that ties us

38:30.880 --> 38:36.720
together that makes us all into one thing is the internet. And the internet can be directed so that

38:37.360 --> 38:43.440
within all the different communities of people, start to work together for one global program.

38:43.440 --> 38:50.080
And so we are meant to become one super organism on the earth. And in fact, in alignment with the earth

38:50.080 --> 38:57.920
as part of the earth. And that's what their their idea of evolution is. But to get people to do this,

38:57.920 --> 39:01.600
they have to elevate their thinking. In other words, they have to have consciousness

39:01.600 --> 39:06.480
raising. In other words, they have to have evolution of consciousness into a global and even as we're

39:06.480 --> 39:11.840
going to hear cosmic consciousness, or astral consciousness that goes above that, and can picture

39:11.840 --> 39:18.320
humanity operating as a global collective. Again, I urge you to realize that this is the exact same

39:18.320 --> 39:23.120
program Karl Marx was was banging on about. Karl just had a different method and a different

39:23.120 --> 39:28.640
formulation. But it's the exact same method that we are all the same. We're all the same

39:29.520 --> 39:34.480
collective, we're all intrinsically meant to be working together. But only the spiritually

39:34.480 --> 39:39.040
advanced what Karl Marx called socialists can actually see it. And here, it's going to be

39:39.040 --> 39:44.720
people with cosmic consciousness. And he is dead serious that the purpose of the United Nations

39:44.720 --> 39:50.880
going forward is going to be to direct the spiritual evolution of man into a single global

39:50.880 --> 40:00.240
collective in a single transformational that is heretical, evil world religion. So let's skip

40:00.240 --> 40:04.160
straight to the end and read idea 2000. And we're going to see this is pretty explicit. He says,

40:04.160 --> 40:11.280
from our current world pessimism, we can be saved and uplifted by this personal conclusion I arrived

40:11.280 --> 40:19.760
at an idea 552. Namely, perhaps out of my passion for life and for this miraculous earth, a new

40:19.760 --> 40:25.760
theory of evolution can be shaped. Namely, that with our recently acquired tremendous human

40:25.760 --> 40:31.440
knowledge of the universe and of our planet, we will henceforth be more than the mere preservers

40:31.440 --> 40:38.080
and savers of the earth, but will be her instruments, her most advanced evolutionary agents, her

40:38.080 --> 40:44.720
children endowed with the evolutionary task to make it an even more astonishing planet and cosmic

40:44.720 --> 40:51.600
evolutionary success, perhaps the most advanced ultimate masterpiece in the universe and God.

40:52.720 --> 40:57.600
Since each species born from nature is a miracle, we are certainly a miracle too.

40:57.600 --> 41:04.080
What great excitement it will be when in the year 2000 humanity will accept this as its new,

41:04.800 --> 41:11.920
all encompassing common objective for the 21st century to make this earth a paradise,

41:11.920 --> 41:17.680
to make humanity a miracle. So I'm not kidding. That's literally what he's about.

41:18.320 --> 41:22.000
That's literally the program. So let's make something extremely clear.

41:23.200 --> 41:29.360
Going to remind you of a word I already used. An intentional theory of evolution for mankind

41:29.360 --> 41:34.080
is eugenics. Let me say that again, because that's what the United Nations through Robert Mueller is

41:34.080 --> 41:38.560
advocating for. And like I said, this is the real United Nations, at least in this century,

41:38.560 --> 41:43.360
I think maybe all along. I seriously think that, but at least in this century. Let me just say

41:43.360 --> 41:48.880
that sentence one more time and I'll say it slowly so it sinks in. An intentional theory of evolution

41:48.880 --> 42:00.320
for mankind is eugenics. The call for man to complete God's creation is esoteric occult

42:00.320 --> 42:06.640
theosophy. We could talk about whether it's inspired from hermetic ideas. You hear the idea

42:06.720 --> 42:13.920
straight up, the Gnostic concept in idea number 2000 here. From our current world pessimism,

42:14.720 --> 42:23.680
we can be saved and uplifted by this secret knowledge that we can actually have a

42:24.560 --> 42:29.040
directed evolution to become the ultimate masterpiece of the universe and God.

42:29.600 --> 42:37.280
So let me make that real clear. This is eugenics. This is the real United Nations and its operating

42:37.280 --> 42:43.520
system is a call for man to complete God's creation, which is esoteric occult theosophy.

42:44.560 --> 42:51.200
This is, we should have nothing to do with this organization. It is not merely a meeting place

42:51.200 --> 42:55.840
for governance to figure out global treaties and things like that. It's nothing of the kind.

42:56.400 --> 43:02.720
And he's extremely serious about this and devotes many of his ideas to making this a reality

43:02.720 --> 43:09.840
through his vision for a United Nations-centered world government. Let's read 1904. Idea number

43:09.840 --> 43:16.240
1904. I recommend that a totally new world organization should be considered for our

43:16.240 --> 43:23.120
earth and humanity. A world organization of evolution into which the United Nations could

43:23.120 --> 43:29.280
be incorporated. This organization would listen to evolutionary scientists who look at evolution

43:29.280 --> 43:35.440
in its multiplicity of forms, from the smallest bacteria to the evolution of humankind,

43:35.440 --> 43:42.160
within the basic elements of the planet, its airs, its water, its climate, etc., and who have a long

43:42.160 --> 43:48.800
term view, Gnostic, who have a long term view of what the future evolution of this planet is likely to be.

43:49.120 --> 43:54.880
This is indispensable because henceforth everything on this planet has to be seen in terms of a long

43:54.880 --> 44:03.040
term future evolution. Our species is now in charge of the earth's future evolution. If we stick to

44:03.040 --> 44:11.040
obsolete values, we will put an end to it. But if we adopt new values, new objectives, visions,

44:11.040 --> 44:19.200
institutions, and laws, evolution will continue. This is henceforth problem number one on this

44:19.200 --> 44:27.440
planet. Everything else has to abide to it. It then continues this thought in Idea 1905. The new

44:27.440 --> 44:33.600
world organization of evolution would issue yearly reports on the state of evolution of our

44:33.600 --> 44:39.680
planet, review the prospects of the future, and recommend corrective actions, including emergency

44:40.400 --> 44:49.440
measures and world laws. Idea 1906. The most important single step that could help save the

44:49.440 --> 44:55.680
earth and humanity would be to create in each government a ministry of the future, and in the

44:55.680 --> 45:02.000
United Nations and in each of its agencies a department and commission of the future. It would

45:02.000 --> 45:08.400
be the first step toward the creation of a world organization of evolution. It is good that the

45:08.480 --> 45:14.800
European Union had the vision to create a position of commissioner for the future. May this good

45:14.800 --> 45:19.520
example be followed by many institutions around the world, public and private.

45:22.000 --> 45:28.960
ESG serves that role, by the way, in a slightly different capacity without necessarily a direct

45:29.760 --> 45:35.200
department. That's what ESG was designed to do. Besides the redirecting of money and impact

45:35.200 --> 45:43.360
investing, ESG was designed to assess the long-term viability in terms of environmental and social

45:44.480 --> 45:54.880
programs plus corporate governance practices. Idea 1907. When one considers the vital importance

45:54.880 --> 46:02.000
of the future evolution of this planet and of humanity, it would be also important to create

46:02.080 --> 46:08.400
a world university of evolution and the future, or at least faculties of evolution and the future

46:08.400 --> 46:14.240
in all universities. When I did that episode not that long ago, where I talked about the UNESCO

46:14.240 --> 46:18.720
document, it was a series of four, the strange death of the university, where I talked about how

46:18.720 --> 46:23.360
the sustainable development goals were to be incorporated completely into university education,

46:23.360 --> 46:30.960
ASAP, at all levels. There you go. This stuff is crazy, but it gets way crazier than this. We're

46:30.960 --> 46:37.040
not even close to crazy. I'm going to skip to the first part of super crazy. This might be the

46:37.040 --> 46:43.600
craziest part. I showed this to Charlie Kirk, and he was just like, what? What? Whoa. Whoa.

46:44.640 --> 46:50.640
Overwhelming. It's this freaking crazy. I want my Christian audience to listen very carefully to

46:50.640 --> 46:56.080
what this says, because I need you to understand how off the rails the United Nations is and how

46:56.080 --> 47:00.720
out of step. Why are they attacking Christianity so hard? You just heard the old values are going

47:00.800 --> 47:04.800
to kill the planet. The old beliefs are going to kill the planet. We have to get rid of them.

47:04.800 --> 47:10.960
So what does he propose here? It's not just that he intends his vision to be moved by the

47:10.960 --> 47:17.520
governments, but very explicitly intends it to be moved by a single new world religion coordinated

47:18.160 --> 47:24.160
as an evolutionary religion, that is occult theosophy, headquartered through the United

47:24.160 --> 47:29.200
Nations or through a new body that the United Nations is incorporated into. And the goal is to,

47:29.200 --> 47:34.320
for him, and I'm not kidding, listen, the goal for him is to envision the United Nations as the

47:34.320 --> 47:40.880
body that is tasked with resetting the world. A great reset, right? Resetting the world with a new

47:40.880 --> 47:45.840
creation. I mean that because the next thing he talks about, at least that I'm going to tell you

47:45.840 --> 47:50.240
about, these are from ideas we were just in the 1900s, we're skipping back to the 1300s,

47:51.120 --> 47:58.560
he literally talks about the concept of a United Nations centered new genesis. Genesis is the first

47:58.560 --> 48:05.120
book of the Bible. Genesis 1 and 2 describe the creation of the world. If you recall your Genesis

48:05.120 --> 48:09.840
1, he talks about the seven days in which God created the world, the six in which he created

48:09.840 --> 48:16.240
it and the seventh upon which he saw that it was good and rested. So pulling from ideas 1301 to

48:16.240 --> 48:21.920
1400, which he offers in a single block in this document with the heading, the spiritual state of

48:21.920 --> 48:31.360
the world, on Earth Day 2013, here's what he writes. Humanity is now a united world community of

48:31.360 --> 48:37.840
nations, not only economic and political, but also spiritual. Following the path opened in the last

48:37.840 --> 48:44.720
century by Doug Homerskold and by Hugh Taunt in the United Nations, by Robert Schumann in Europe,

48:44.720 --> 48:50.960
and also throughout the millennia by prophets and founders of religions and by great sages,

48:50.960 --> 49:00.320
such as Plato, Aristotle, Maimonides, Huxley, Albert Schweitzer, Dillard Deschardin, who is an

49:00.320 --> 49:07.280
outright hermeticist, Thomas Berry, Bishop William Swing, and others. I'm sure digging into all of

49:07.280 --> 49:12.080
those people will uncover that they have very questionable religious beliefs, maybe apart

49:12.080 --> 49:19.200
from Aristotle. Humanity's material, scientific and technological, technological feats of the

49:19.200 --> 49:25.760
20th century, he says, have been transcended first into the moral ethical realm, then into

49:25.760 --> 49:33.040
philanthropy and guiafili, love for humanity and our Earth. That's the key value, by the way,

49:33.040 --> 49:39.280
not just of his program, but of the degrowth communism to fix the metabolic rift that Marx

49:39.280 --> 49:42.800
predicted. If you go back and listen to the degrowth communism podcast that I did recently,

49:42.800 --> 49:48.240
you'll see it's the exact same idea, guiafili, love for humanity and for our Earth. It's all

49:48.240 --> 49:52.480
theosophical occultism. Marxism is just a branch of theosophical occultism that had a very

49:53.200 --> 50:00.240
powerful success record in installing itself politically. And so he says, sorry, humanities

50:00.880 --> 50:05.200
feats of the 20th century have been transcended first into the moral ethical realm, then into

50:05.200 --> 50:11.200
philanthropy and guiafili, and finally into the highest form of all the spiritual dimension heralded

50:11.200 --> 50:17.280
for so long by all religions, namely the right understanding of our place and relationship

50:17.360 --> 50:24.240
in the universe and in time and of our fundamental cosmic nature and role. If you needed more proof

50:24.240 --> 50:32.080
that this is occult theosophy, I don't know what to tell you, but he's invoking the underlying

50:32.640 --> 50:37.840
hermetic concept of the priesthood theologiae there, that there is this ancient world religion,

50:37.840 --> 50:43.840
that all sciences, all thought, all cultures, all religions, all everything are just reflections

50:43.840 --> 50:48.080
of. Hinduism is just doing the best it can, just like quantum physics is doing the best it can,

50:48.080 --> 50:54.000
to explain this one true thing about all of reality. And he thinks that we've now hit the

50:54.000 --> 51:00.960
point where we can actually start to articulate that. The phenomenal expansion of human senses

51:00.960 --> 51:05.840
and physical capabilities through science and technology was followed by the birth and development

51:05.840 --> 51:12.960
of a global brain, a global nervous system, a global heart, and a global soul to humanity.

51:13.040 --> 51:19.120
So Hegel's geist. Much remains to be done to perfect and refine these gains and to integrate

51:19.120 --> 51:25.200
them fully into the total life system of our living planet, skipping a bit. We came to understand

51:25.200 --> 51:31.520
that we are all part of a total living planet which is itself a cosmic body of the universe,

51:32.240 --> 51:37.680
and that in this living system we are linked not only to the earth but to each other and to the

51:37.680 --> 51:42.640
heavens in which we live. The miraculous transformation we have experienced in the

51:42.640 --> 51:48.960
progress of humanity is a result of our cooperation of the world's religions along the lines of the

51:48.960 --> 51:55.120
vast frameworks of our knowledge and our needed actions born in the United Nations and its agencies.

51:55.760 --> 52:01.040
So let's be real clear. He's saying that everything is all one, that's the occult

52:01.040 --> 52:06.160
theosophical view, and that it's actually coming together through the United Nations and its agencies.

52:07.040 --> 52:11.600
These led to a better understanding of our planet and place in the universe of our

52:11.600 --> 52:18.000
total human family, of our place in time, and of the miracle of individual human life.

52:18.640 --> 52:23.040
The last decades of the 20th century provided humanity with the global information

52:24.000 --> 52:30.560
and first experiences indispensable for our better behavior, for better earth government,

52:30.560 --> 52:35.760
and for the physical, mental, moral, effective, and spiritual fulfillment of all humans

52:36.320 --> 52:43.040
blessed with the miracle of life. So we're going to skip a few grandiose paragraphs with

52:43.040 --> 52:48.320
fancy grandiose headings about the unique role of humans in place and time, and we're going to

52:48.320 --> 52:51.920
skip down to one of his subject headings, it's titled the miracle of individual life.

52:53.360 --> 52:57.360
This fourth framework, so you can guess that we skipped three, this fourth framework which

52:57.360 --> 53:03.120
revolves around the centrality of the human person goes far deeper and beyond human institutions.

53:03.120 --> 53:08.560
It has become increasingly clear that in the vast global quantum change in human consciousness,

53:08.560 --> 53:13.520
so does that sound like Deepak Chopra? It does. Why? Because he's one of them. He's actually

53:13.520 --> 53:18.240
a very important figure, he's one of them. You know about the evolutionary leaders and people

53:18.240 --> 53:24.080
like Deepak Chopra? Because Oprah Winfrey put them on TV all the time, dozens of times, over and over

53:24.320 --> 53:31.440
again and mainline them into our culture. It has become increasingly clear that in the vast

53:31.440 --> 53:37.280
global quantum change in human consciousness, individuals are the alpha and omega. Oh, we're

53:37.280 --> 53:45.920
God, okay. The basic living cosmic units of evolution. Individual, what? Don't all biological

53:45.920 --> 53:52.480
things evolve on the theory of evolution? But no, human beings, human consciousness,

53:53.680 --> 54:00.240
individuals. Individual human life is the highest form of universal consciousness. This is just the

54:00.240 --> 54:04.400
theosophical belief set that we are the unique creature that's able to figure out where the

54:04.400 --> 54:09.280
divine has been fragmented so that we can lead God to realize himself so that we eventually,

54:09.280 --> 54:14.240
God realizes that we are no different from one another or anything else and in fact that we

54:14.240 --> 54:19.920
are always God. That's literally it. Individual human life is the highest form of universal

54:19.920 --> 54:25.520
consciousness. With the recognition of universal human rights and responsibilities, it became apparent

54:25.520 --> 54:32.000
that institution systems, states, groupings, entities had no consciousness and could only be

54:32.000 --> 54:37.440
instruments, servants, means for the increase of individual consciousness, fulfillment and

54:37.520 --> 54:44.800
responsibility. The highest goal for humankind is to attain optimum physical, mental, effective,

54:45.360 --> 54:51.280
moral, and spiritual lives as a part of the total life system of our planet.

54:52.640 --> 54:58.000
So are you getting the idea that this is a super crackpot religion? It is. Optimum physical life

54:58.000 --> 55:03.360
involves knowledge and care of the human body, the human ability to see, to hear, to observe,

55:03.360 --> 55:10.560
to create, to do, to act, to transform, and the expansion of all senses and physical abilities.

55:11.440 --> 55:15.840
That's, there you go. Optimum meant that, by the way, Karl Marx says the same thing in the

55:15.840 --> 55:20.000
Economic Philosophic Manuscript, by the way, by the way, he says the exact same thing. It's the

55:20.000 --> 55:26.000
exact same theosophical nonsense and I think that Karl Marx stole it from the Corpus Hermaticum.

55:26.800 --> 55:32.720
It's way too weird that it's in there in Karl Marx's Economic Philosophic Manuscripts and that

55:32.800 --> 55:38.160
it's so closely paralleled to stuff that's in the Corpus Hermaticum, which is the ancient

55:38.160 --> 55:44.560
Hermatic religious text, which by the way has 17 books. The 17s just keep coming up. I'm just saying

55:44.560 --> 55:48.720
this is exactly the same thing that's expressed there and it's not because this guy's a Marxist,

55:48.720 --> 55:55.120
it's because Marx was one of them. It's that they are all theosophical occultists who think that

55:55.120 --> 56:02.160
they have the secret knowledge and the divine right to transform man to complete creation.

56:03.280 --> 56:07.440
They're the alpha and the, man is the alpha and the omega, the beginning and the end, the creator

56:07.440 --> 56:13.600
and the conclusion. He says, optimal mental life involves knowledge and education,

56:13.600 --> 56:18.880
which of course they took control of, the ability to question, to think, to analyze, to synthesize,

56:20.480 --> 56:26.640
to synthesize, to conclude, to communicate, the ability to focus from the infinitely small to

56:26.640 --> 56:30.800
the infinitely large, from the local to the global, from the past to the future,

56:30.800 --> 56:37.120
to be what Hinduism calls trickledarshish, sorry, I can't say it, I don't know, omniscient,

56:38.080 --> 56:44.720
particularly all knowing across time, past, present and future, and tricholanaths,

56:45.280 --> 56:52.800
which is omnipotence, mastery of the three worlds. Optimum, effective and moral life

56:52.800 --> 56:58.000
involves the ability to love and the human virtues of truth, understanding, humility,

56:58.000 --> 57:04.560
liberty, responsibility, reverence for life, compassion, altruism and charity. And finally,

57:04.560 --> 57:11.120
optimum spiritual life involves the ability for interiority, meditation, prayer, communion with

57:11.120 --> 57:19.840
the universe and eternity and with God. Here, the United Nations, the United Religions, UNESCO

57:19.840 --> 57:25.600
and other world agencies stand today in the forefront of human progress and evolution,

57:26.240 --> 57:32.720
in the education, information, enlightened democracy, transcendence, and fulfillment of the

57:32.720 --> 57:39.440
miracle of human life and its contribution and responsibility in the overall cosmic evolution

57:39.440 --> 57:48.320
of our planet and of the universe. We have a role in the evolution of the universe, like this is the

57:48.320 --> 57:55.040
most ridiculous, but it's just a cult theosophy, you've got to understand, you may not even know

57:55.040 --> 57:59.520
the word theosophy yet, you need to know the word theosophy because the spiritual war that

57:59.520 --> 58:06.240
we're in right now is theosophy versus theology. Theology is a serious pursuit of religious truth

58:06.240 --> 58:16.400
and theosophy is a cult. I was going to say it's an occult cult, which sounds stupid so that's why

58:16.400 --> 58:22.080
I stalled out there, but that's what it is, it's a cult based on occult beliefs. He says this is

58:22.080 --> 58:26.240
where we stand at the moment, in the year 2013, I don't know how this is in a document delivered

58:26.240 --> 58:31.200
in 1999, I don't know if it was added later, that's beside the point, it's in the freaking

58:31.200 --> 58:35.840
document, you can go look at it, I can show you the page numbers, he must have added to this

58:35.840 --> 58:40.720
and cobbled it together later as a kind of grouping of things that he thinks. But anyway,

58:40.720 --> 58:45.680
this is where we stand at the moment in the year 2013, 20 years after the second world parliament

58:45.680 --> 58:51.920
of religions. It represents a unique, tremendous quantum jump in consciousness and evolution of

58:51.920 --> 58:58.960
humanity. We know our planet inside out and we are now in charge of its future. That seems very

58:59.760 --> 59:06.480
taking on playing God. We even know a good part of the heavens, we have entered the cosmic age

59:06.480 --> 59:11.600
of our evolution. So skipping more of this waffle, because I want to get to the scary stuff.

59:12.240 --> 59:16.080
Similarly, the pragmatic efforts of the religions and of the united religions,

59:16.080 --> 59:22.080
that's an organization by the way, are complemented by a world spirituality university,

59:22.080 --> 59:27.600
which has developed a science of spirituality, and Alice Bailey called it the science of

59:27.600 --> 59:34.080
right human relations. A strategy for spirituality and a methodology of spirituality derived from

59:34.080 --> 59:39.440
all religious practices, celebrations and rites around the world, aimed at the spiritual fulfillment

59:39.440 --> 59:46.480
and responsibility of human beings. As a result, the world is in a new period of full flowering

59:46.480 --> 59:52.480
spiritual renaissance, far beyond inter-religious dialogue. Remember, that's what he called for

59:52.480 --> 59:58.880
back in 1999, and here it is in 2013, saying that we're there. Based on the common spirituality

59:58.880 --> 01:00:04.400
of all religions and on a common denominator of all human beings, the yearning for answers to the

01:00:04.400 --> 01:00:11.360
mysteries of life and death and of our universe, to which the scientific age, despite its amazing

01:00:11.360 --> 01:00:21.680
advances, was unable to find satisfying answers. The age of scientific analysis and dissection,

01:00:21.680 --> 01:00:27.280
our checkered history of local cultures and national divisions, the millennia of religious

01:00:27.280 --> 01:00:32.720
dissections and of the spiritual nature of humanity, of the earth and of the cosmos,

01:00:32.720 --> 01:00:39.920
have now led to a new age of universality, holism, evolutionism, and all-encompassing

01:00:39.920 --> 01:00:46.240
convergence, synthesis, synergy, and transcendence. That sounds like some Antichrist stuff,

01:00:47.040 --> 01:00:51.120
so I'm skipping a lot more after a bunch of bullet points for what this world might look like in

01:00:51.120 --> 01:00:56.320
practice, which probably I should cover, but this is going to be super long anyway. He says,

01:00:56.400 --> 01:01:03.600
at that point I looked up from the text, so he's working on laying out what this should look like.

01:01:03.600 --> 01:01:08.320
At that point I looked up from the text and seized a copy of a book I had written many years ago in

01:01:08.320 --> 01:01:13.840
the last century, meaning in the 90s, when I was a young world servant, I don't know if it's in the

01:01:13.840 --> 01:01:18.720
90s, so before 2000 I should say, when I was a young world servant of the United Nations,

01:01:19.440 --> 01:01:27.520
entitled New Genesis, Shaping a Global Spirituality, and read the following text of mine. So this is

01:01:27.520 --> 01:01:34.080
the vision that was guiding his thought from very early on in his world servant capacity at the

01:01:34.080 --> 01:01:44.560
United Nations. He said, he wrote, and God saw all the nations of the earth, black and white,

01:01:44.560 --> 01:01:50.480
poor and rich, from north and south, from east and west, and all of the creeds were sending

01:01:50.480 --> 01:01:56.240
their emissaries to a tall glass house on the shores of the river of the rising sun, on the

01:01:56.240 --> 01:02:02.720
island of Manhattan, to study together, to think together, and to care together for the world and

01:02:02.720 --> 01:02:10.080
all its people, and God said, that is good. And it was the first day of the new era of the earth.

01:02:11.040 --> 01:02:19.120
Pause. Where is the glass house on the, a tall glass house on the shores of the river of the

01:02:19.120 --> 01:02:26.560
rising sun on the island of Manhattan? Hmm, is it the United Nations building? It is. So let's

01:02:26.560 --> 01:02:34.960
phrase it more, more straightly. And God saw that all the nations of the earth, and all its people,

01:02:35.120 --> 01:02:41.280
from all its creeds, were sending their emissaries to the United Nations building

01:02:41.920 --> 01:02:46.480
to study together, to think together, and care together for this world and all of its people,

01:02:46.480 --> 01:02:53.520
and God said, that is good. And it was the first day of the new era of the earth.

01:02:54.320 --> 01:03:01.600
This is the United Nations. This is the UN. Time to abolish the UN. But he's not done.

01:03:02.480 --> 01:03:07.360
And God saw that soldiers of peace were separating the combatants of quarreling nations.

01:03:08.080 --> 01:03:13.600
So that's their blue hats, that differences were being resolved by negotiation and reason instead

01:03:13.600 --> 01:03:19.280
of arms, and that leaders of nations were seeing each other, taking to each other and joining

01:03:19.280 --> 01:03:25.920
their hearts, minds, souls, and strength, that's a reference to Jesus, the Gospels, for the benefit

01:03:25.920 --> 01:03:32.880
of all humanity. And God said, that is good. And it was the second day of the planet of peace.

01:03:33.840 --> 01:03:40.480
So he just compared the blue hats to Jesus' disciples by the way. And God saw that humans

01:03:40.480 --> 01:03:46.000
were loving the entire creation, the stars and the sun, the day and the night, the air and the

01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:51.680
oceans, the earth and the waters, the fishes and the fowl, the flowers and the herbs, and all their

01:03:51.680 --> 01:03:58.560
human brethren and sisters. And God said, that is good. And it was the third day of the planet

01:03:58.560 --> 01:04:05.200
of happiness. And God saw that humans were suppressing hunger, disease, ignorance, and

01:04:05.200 --> 01:04:11.280
suffering all over the globe, providing each human person with a decent, conscious, and happy life,

01:04:11.280 --> 01:04:17.680
no discontious, and reducing the greed, the power, and the wealth of the few. And he said, that is

01:04:17.680 --> 01:04:25.600
good. And it was the fourth day of the planet of justice. And God saw that humans were living in

01:04:25.600 --> 01:04:31.200
harmony with their planet and in peace with one another, wisely managing their resources, avoiding

01:04:31.200 --> 01:04:40.000
waste, curbing excesses, replacing hatred with love, greed with contentment, arrogance with humility,

01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:45.920
division with cooperation, and mistrust with understanding. And he said, that is good. And

01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:51.600
it was the fifth day of the golden planet. And God saw that men were destroying their arms,

01:04:51.600 --> 01:04:56.560
bombs, missiles, warships, and warplanes, dismantling their bases and disbanding their armies,

01:04:56.560 --> 01:05:01.600
keeping only policemen of peace to protect the good from the bad and the normal from the mad.

01:05:01.600 --> 01:05:09.840
And God said, that is good. And it was the sixth day of the planet of reason. And God saw humans

01:05:09.840 --> 01:05:19.760
restore God. And God saw humans restore God and the human person as the Alpha and Omega. And God

01:05:19.760 --> 01:05:27.280
saw humans restore God and the human person as the Alpha and Omega, reducing institutions, beliefs,

01:05:27.280 --> 01:05:33.440
politics, governments, and all manmade entities to mere servants of God and the people. And he saw

01:05:33.440 --> 01:05:38.560
them adopt as their supreme law. You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, all your

01:05:38.560 --> 01:05:43.040
soul, all your mind, and all your strength. You shall love your neighbor as yourself. There is

01:05:43.040 --> 01:05:48.880
no greater commandment than these. And God said, that is good. And it was the seventh day of the

01:05:48.880 --> 01:05:56.160
planet of God. I let the book rest on my lap and looked around me at the magnificent divine nature

01:05:56.160 --> 01:06:05.440
of the sacred Mount Ressur and addressed these words of thanks to God. Thank you, dear Lord,

01:06:05.520 --> 01:06:12.960
for having fulfilled my dream. And I seized my harmonica and played on it the ode to joy of

01:06:12.960 --> 01:06:18.240
Beethoven. So it turns out this harmonica thing, that's the end of the page, this harmonica thing

01:06:18.240 --> 01:06:23.280
actually happened. I kind of meant to play it for you. Maybe we can work this thing in. I'm not 100

01:06:23.280 --> 01:06:27.760
percent sure. Maybe I'll work in the sound so you can actually hear that it wasn't Robert Mueller,

01:06:27.760 --> 01:06:34.240
but somebody else played the harmonica in the United Nations and played ode to joy. And what

01:06:34.240 --> 01:06:40.800
that means is they knew that this was happening. So hopefully we'll cut this in. Dear colleagues,

01:06:40.800 --> 01:06:47.840
these are our last decisions in this mandate. And I would like to thank you for five years of unity

01:06:47.840 --> 01:06:55.920
in diversity. It is our responsibility to keep Europe together and let rebuild Notre Dame and

01:06:55.920 --> 01:07:09.600
Happy Easter.

01:07:26.080 --> 01:07:37.520
But that's certainly something, isn't it? Something very heretical.

01:07:38.560 --> 01:07:43.680
So how is it all supposed to work? Let's go back to his ideas. So now we know what they're up to,

01:07:43.680 --> 01:07:48.480
a new genesis, a new recreated world, a new recreation of life, where God works on all

01:07:48.480 --> 01:07:54.480
seven days, by the way, and in which the United Nations is a tall house of glass that is where

01:07:54.480 --> 01:08:00.720
God says that it all comes from. Isn't that great? So evil. And how is it supposed to work? Well,

01:08:00.720 --> 01:08:08.880
let's listen. Idea 1382 from the 23rd of April, 1998. Like the capitalists and communists did

01:08:08.880 --> 01:08:14.400
at the end of the last century, we should think hard and conceive how we can make the next century

01:08:14.400 --> 01:08:20.800
a paradise, since both communism and capitalism have failed. And since we live in planetary

01:08:20.800 --> 01:08:26.240
conditions very different from those at the end of the last century, we must think afresh all of

01:08:26.240 --> 01:08:32.960
our current beliefs, doings, and institutions, and formulate an entirely new ideology or dreamology

01:08:33.680 --> 01:08:39.840
for an unprecedented future in all human history. Heads of governments, of corporations,

01:08:39.840 --> 01:08:46.000
and of all human institutions should be excited by this new, wonderful challenge. And what should

01:08:46.240 --> 01:08:54.480
challenge solve? Idea 1343, 15 March, 1998. Humanity has achieved so much progress,

01:08:54.480 --> 01:09:00.000
has solved so many problems, avoided so many dangers, and yet now we face the most colossal

01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:06.080
problem in the entire human history and evolution, namely that industry, technology, commerce,

01:09:06.080 --> 01:09:12.720
transport, overpopulation, and overconsumption might destroy the very essence and future of the

01:09:12.720 --> 01:09:21.600
earth, including our own, namely, its nature. We need innumerable great and small ideas and

01:09:21.600 --> 01:09:27.200
efforts to countervail that. But there's a huge problem in this idea, and that huge problem is

01:09:27.200 --> 01:09:37.200
called the United States of America. Idea 1338, 10 March, 1998. From an evolutionary point of view,

01:09:37.200 --> 01:09:43.200
the attacks of the United States against the United Nations and reduction of its roles and means,

01:09:43.200 --> 01:09:48.480
in other words, we were pushing away from the UN and defunding it, will be considered some day

01:09:48.480 --> 01:09:56.160
as one of the greatest errors and lacks of vision in world history. It seems that power went so much

01:09:56.160 --> 01:10:01.920
to the head of the United States that it lost its sense of proportions and direction. Therefore,

01:10:01.920 --> 01:10:08.240
the United States will decline as a power, as did all past powers which did not adapt to new

01:10:08.240 --> 01:10:14.160
fundamental trends of evolution. This happens regrettably on the eve of a new century and millennium

01:10:14.160 --> 01:10:19.120
when all countries, especially the best informed ones, should have the clearest possible mind,

01:10:19.120 --> 01:10:25.440
views, and heart toward a future written in the stars. We must deeply mourn the fact that the

01:10:25.440 --> 01:10:31.040
United States has lost its consciousness of the world's future and of its guiding role in it.

01:10:31.600 --> 01:10:37.680
So what's wrong with the United States? It's powerful enough to be sovereign and to reject

01:10:37.680 --> 01:10:43.280
this theosophy in favor of individual rights and liberties instead of a crackpot world cult.

01:10:45.200 --> 01:10:50.720
What's happened since? Much of what has transpired in the 20th century, especially since about

01:10:50.720 --> 01:10:57.760
2015, has been actually all the way through, starting in 2001, September 11th. 2001, much

01:10:57.760 --> 01:11:02.800
of what has transpired in the 21st century, has been a direct attack on the United States for

01:11:02.800 --> 01:11:09.440
this rejection of the United Nations theosophical ambitions, exactly like Robert Mueller said would

01:11:09.440 --> 01:11:17.440
have to be the case. The United States will have to decline as a power because it's not in line with

01:11:17.440 --> 01:11:22.880
their evolutionary agendas. The United States had its run but it's not going along with the

01:11:22.880 --> 01:11:30.320
program sufficiently so they're going to have to let it fall. That seems to be very in line with

01:11:30.320 --> 01:11:35.280
their program. So the United States should have absolutely nothing to do with this organization.

01:11:35.280 --> 01:11:40.640
It should renew its attacks, it should renew its distance, and it should completely defund

01:11:40.640 --> 01:11:46.400
this evil organization. So then there's another big section based on another block of 100,

01:11:47.040 --> 01:11:53.360
based on ideas 1401 through 1500, and it's even crazier than this new genesis idea that really

01:11:53.360 --> 01:11:58.320
sets the stage for what they want. It calls for a global association of scientists and thinkers

01:11:58.320 --> 01:12:06.320
concerned with long-range evolution. Now this is an excerpt added in by Erica Erdman in her interim

01:12:06.320 --> 01:12:12.720
report published in November of 1997, and it starts off with a quote from so-called quote

01:12:12.720 --> 01:12:18.480
Space Scientist. Eric Chison, I don't think I said his last name right but you whatever.

01:12:19.520 --> 01:12:24.720
The quote says implicit within our cosmic evolutionary paradigm is a transcendence of

01:12:24.720 --> 01:12:30.320
the Darwinian principle of natural selection, a loftier standard that I call the principle

01:12:30.320 --> 01:12:35.760
of cosmic selection. Those technological civilizations of any type on any planet that

01:12:35.760 --> 01:12:42.240
recognize the need for development time and fully embrace a global ethics will survive in those

01:12:42.240 --> 01:12:46.480
that do not will not. Okay, so let's be real clear about something here.

01:12:47.360 --> 01:12:51.920
So my Christian buddies, I need you to listen. When Darwin talked about evolution,

01:12:51.920 --> 01:12:56.480
these people reject that. That is not what they're talking about. They are in fact, remember he said

01:12:56.480 --> 01:13:00.800
they were going to reject survival of the fittest. We're going to reject competition. That's what

01:13:00.800 --> 01:13:05.760
Darwin's ideas were based off of. That is not what they're advocating. They are not advocating for

01:13:05.760 --> 01:13:12.880
Darwinism. They're advocating for directed cosmic evolution. And the claim is that cosmic selection

01:13:12.880 --> 01:13:20.320
is the only planetary civilizations that survive are ones that adopt global ethics. What does that

01:13:20.320 --> 01:13:27.840
mean? And fully adopt, not just adopt, not just adopt it, but fully embrace global ethics. That

01:13:27.840 --> 01:13:33.360
means global cooperation. That means something like the vision of communism. That means the

01:13:33.360 --> 01:13:38.880
theosophical endpoint where we are all one. So if you don't adopt their theosophical occult views

01:13:38.880 --> 01:13:43.920
of what humanity is supposed to be, they believe that there's a pressure that all such civilizations

01:13:43.920 --> 01:13:52.240
will eventually go extinct and will not survive in the grand scheme of cosmic selection, which by

01:13:52.240 --> 01:14:01.360
the way is not real. That is not a theory by which anything is said to say, speciate or differentiate

01:14:02.000 --> 01:14:08.320
persist through time. But that's where it begins. So then we go back to Erica here and she comments

01:14:08.320 --> 01:14:15.120
and says his insight into global problems and his vast perspective led Dr. Robert Muller,

01:14:15.120 --> 01:14:21.040
Chancellor Emeritus of the University for Peace in Costa Rica and former Assistant Secretary General

01:14:21.040 --> 01:14:26.080
of the United Nations to call for a UNESCO backed summit meeting of the world's scientists and

01:14:26.080 --> 01:14:31.680
thinkers concerned with the long term fate of our earth and of humanity, which is endangered by

01:14:31.680 --> 01:14:37.840
blind pursuit of short term goals. He envisions an exchange of knowledge and ideas among the most

01:14:37.840 --> 01:14:44.960
conscientious person on the planet, leading to advances in human wisdom that could not otherwise

01:14:44.960 --> 01:14:51.280
occur. And that would initiate a permanent shift toward a more future oriented responsible attitude

01:14:51.920 --> 01:14:56.240
worldwide. So this global ethic

01:14:58.320 --> 01:15:04.480
supposed to be backed by these ideas that replace blind pursuit of short term goals.

01:15:05.040 --> 01:15:13.360
Again, ESG came in in 2003 to start pushing us in that direction from where? United Nations.

01:15:13.360 --> 01:15:20.160
Comprehensive sexuality education to, I guess, adopt a new global ethic was developed at UNESCO

01:15:20.160 --> 01:15:24.400
in 2003. All straight downstream from these ideas.

01:15:26.320 --> 01:15:32.160
So the objective, they state, the importance and urgency of the project lies in the need for a

01:15:32.160 --> 01:15:38.560
transformation of past inspired ethics with their many contradictions. Fundamentalist shackles

01:15:38.560 --> 01:15:44.960
and mutual hatreds to a future oriented ethic in which all of humanity can unite in a striving

01:15:45.920 --> 01:15:51.040
to become more enlightened and more humane. Apparently, we got to take down the US first.

01:15:52.000 --> 01:15:57.440
Many scientists believe that the universe is dominated by a quote cosmic principle of self

01:15:57.440 --> 01:16:03.280
destruction, a universal law that destroys any civilization in the universe, which has achieved

01:16:03.280 --> 01:16:08.720
a level of intelligence and technical capacity similar to our own. I don't know who these many

01:16:08.720 --> 01:16:14.400
scientists are, because intelligence is not the result of the fiercest competition during the

01:16:14.400 --> 01:16:19.600
process of evolution, they argue, our brains cannot possibly conceive of an alternative

01:16:19.600 --> 01:16:25.920
that would avert our fate. Other scientists see in the process of evolution a forward march,

01:16:25.920 --> 01:16:31.360
not toward more destructive competition, but toward more foresight, insight, wisdom, and love.

01:16:32.080 --> 01:16:36.400
These persons, most of whom are inspired by the teachings of Teilhard de Chardin,

01:16:36.400 --> 01:16:38.800
who I mentioned earlier is one of the hermeticists,

01:16:39.360 --> 01:16:45.280
believe that the trend from the material to the spiritual, from the amoeba to man,

01:16:45.280 --> 01:16:48.240
I told you there's this other video and then they mentioned it here,

01:16:48.240 --> 01:16:53.040
will inevitably be continued toward superior heights of love and wisdom. Now this was written

01:16:53.040 --> 01:17:00.160
in 1997, the amoeba to man thing video that I mentioned was much later, it's much more recent,

01:17:00.160 --> 01:17:05.600
so they've been thinking this for a long time, but this trend from the material to spiritual,

01:17:05.600 --> 01:17:10.800
from the amoeba to man, will inevitably be continued toward superior heights of love and

01:17:10.800 --> 01:17:16.800
wisdom, however threatening present developments on earth may appear to us now. Skipping down a bit,

01:17:17.360 --> 01:17:22.800
an association of scientists concerned with long range evolution would help to sort these

01:17:22.800 --> 01:17:28.560
contradictions out, and to align and attract thinkers and scientists toward a superior goal.

01:17:28.560 --> 01:17:33.680
It is urgently needed to show the pessimists that alternatives to competition until death

01:17:34.160 --> 01:17:40.560
do exist, even in non-human nature but especially in human nature. To show the optimists that

01:17:40.560 --> 01:17:46.800
reliance on non-human determination of our fate might weaken our sense of personal responsibility

01:17:46.800 --> 01:17:52.800
for our descendants and our earth, and to impress upon the majority the importance of a long range

01:17:52.800 --> 01:17:59.200
and encompassing vision to guide our choices. Hello ESG. And then they put in bold, a whole

01:17:59.200 --> 01:18:05.680
paragraph in bold, what unites us is a look at the miracle of evolution from a cosmic perspective,

01:18:06.640 --> 01:18:13.440
a non-stick perspective guys. It is the effort to prevent our species from becoming another dead

01:18:13.440 --> 01:18:20.240
end bypassed by ongoing development of life. It is a search for principles and values guiding

01:18:20.240 --> 01:18:29.120
humanity toward further ascent. So we got to spiritually evolve the entire species. And what

01:18:29.120 --> 01:18:33.680
in the world is this based on? Where did they get these crazy ideas about oh no everything's

01:18:33.680 --> 01:18:38.720
going to be bad, we're going to destroy ourselves, every civilization of our kind at our level of

01:18:38.720 --> 01:18:43.680
advancement or whatever destroys itself. And I mean on a planetary sense, I don't mean like the

01:18:43.680 --> 01:18:49.760
fall of Rome, I mean like everybody goes extinct, the whole thing falls apart. So what is this all

01:18:49.760 --> 01:18:55.440
based on? Aside from some weird book that they do mention of questionable worth about cosmic

01:18:55.440 --> 01:19:00.080
evolution and some quote from a space scientist. The book about cosmic evolution by the way,

01:19:00.080 --> 01:19:05.840
is taken to be the impetus for what I just read. But it turns out that underneath all this are the

01:19:06.400 --> 01:19:11.120
neo-malthusian ideas of the club of Rome and the limits to growth. You remember when I talked

01:19:11.120 --> 01:19:16.880
about the limits to growth? Now these guys thought that the world was going to outstrip,

01:19:16.880 --> 01:19:20.320
the humans were going to outstrip the world's resources and we would all have a population

01:19:20.320 --> 01:19:25.600
collapse. And the whole degrowth premise, the whole depopulation premise that we have to

01:19:25.600 --> 01:19:30.560
keep putting on the table is all because they believe what was written in the club of Rome in

01:19:30.560 --> 01:19:37.440
1971 or two in the book that they published limits to growth, which turned out to make

01:19:37.440 --> 01:19:41.680
lots of predictions for the year 2000 that we're all wrong. Turns out that's their inspiration.

01:19:41.680 --> 01:19:46.560
Here's what they write. Professor D.H. Meadows from the United States is a System Analyst

01:19:46.560 --> 01:19:53.200
and Journalist. Professor of Systems Management D.L. Meadows from the U.S. is Director of the

01:19:53.200 --> 01:19:58.560
Institute for Policy and Social Science Research and Professor J. Randers is a Policy Analyst

01:19:58.560 --> 01:20:03.440
and President Emeritus of the Norwegian School of Management, Chairman of the Norwegian Bank of

01:20:03.440 --> 01:20:08.800
Industry, Norwegian Institute for Market Research and Deputy Director General of the World Wildlife

01:20:08.800 --> 01:20:12.640
Fund, which by the way is, if you didn't know that the World Wildlife Fund is really part of this

01:20:12.640 --> 01:20:18.640
whole global agenda big time, well it is. And here's why. In fact, it was probably created as such.

01:20:18.640 --> 01:20:23.360
I don't know for sure. All three authors collaborated on the pathbreaking book,

01:20:23.360 --> 01:20:29.120
The Limits to Growth, published 20 years ago. Their present book, Beyond the Limits from 1992,

01:20:30.240 --> 01:20:35.280
also provides such clear convincing and well documented information about our present world

01:20:35.280 --> 01:20:40.880
and the dangers of rapid uncontrolled growth that it is difficult to imagine how it could fail to

01:20:40.880 --> 01:20:47.360
have an immense impact. Growth is defined as material resource consuming advance only,

01:20:47.360 --> 01:20:53.680
while all other growth is called development. The authors however see no indication that people

01:20:53.680 --> 01:20:59.440
are reasonable enough to reverse their lifestyles in time. Once overshoot becomes evident,

01:20:59.440 --> 01:21:04.720
moreover in most cases it will be too late once depletion is clearly visible. So these people

01:21:04.720 --> 01:21:09.680
are going to save the world from itself in line with the Limits to Growth Club of Rome stuff.

01:21:09.680 --> 01:21:14.640
And remember the World Economic Forum guys, Klaus Schwab in particular, invited these exact same

01:21:14.640 --> 01:21:21.760
people from the Club of Rome to speak at the World Economic Forum in its second year of existing

01:21:21.760 --> 01:21:28.560
way back in the 1970s. So this is this is the idea behind almost all of this. So almost all

01:21:28.640 --> 01:21:33.280
crackpot faiths and real faiths both present two alternatives, heaven and hell.

01:21:34.320 --> 01:21:39.200
We know what that looks like in Christianity, for example. What we can also see what it looks like

01:21:40.320 --> 01:21:44.160
from Herbert Marcuse. He says that we're either going to have communism or liberation,

01:21:44.160 --> 01:21:47.840
I should say, or we're going to have fascism. So we have heaven or hell. Those are our two choices.

01:21:47.840 --> 01:21:55.440
And here the evolutionary new thought, Gnostic new thought of the United Nations,

01:21:55.440 --> 01:22:00.240
which is rooted down in this idea of sustainability and inclusion, presents us heaven and hell.

01:22:00.240 --> 01:22:07.680
We're either going to degrow to a utopian circular economy intentionally and intelligently under

01:22:07.680 --> 01:22:13.280
their global management with their new global faith heaven. Or what we're going to do is we're

01:22:13.280 --> 01:22:17.680
going to collapse our world. We're going to have massive over massive depletion that becomes a

01:22:17.680 --> 01:22:24.080
downwards vicious circle that destroys the capacity for life on the planet. And then we all die.

01:22:24.080 --> 01:22:30.160
So it's the same, same, same structure. So that's this crazy setup. But let's skip down a little

01:22:30.160 --> 01:22:37.040
further. Read idea 1433, which he wrote the 13th of June 1998. He says we urgently need as we enter

01:22:37.040 --> 01:22:42.640
a new century and millennium, a world conference to appraise the present state of evolution on this

01:22:42.640 --> 01:22:49.040
planet and to provide worldviews on future evolution in the next century and millennium.

01:22:49.040 --> 01:22:56.640
After humanism, after the environment, after the earth, now future evolution has become priority

01:22:56.640 --> 01:23:06.640
number one. Idea 1499, 18 August 1998. After communism and capitalism, frugalism, which is

01:23:06.640 --> 01:23:12.960
degrowth, they just didn't have the word to use in 98. After communism and capitalism,

01:23:12.960 --> 01:23:18.560
frugalism might become the new ideology and rule of our behavior on earth, demanding from us

01:23:18.560 --> 01:23:25.120
more frugal and simple lives in order not to destroy life giving nature. A new economic system

01:23:25.120 --> 01:23:31.840
must be born, which will not produce colossal waste on necessary products built in rapid

01:23:31.840 --> 01:23:39.920
obsolescence and colossal duplications between 185 nations. That's exactly the argument of Herbert

01:23:39.920 --> 01:23:46.960
Marcuse and one dimensional man. Frugalism and simplicity of life might become the salvation

01:23:46.960 --> 01:23:53.040
of the earth and future generations. It's also the argument of the degrowth capitalism or degrowth

01:23:53.040 --> 01:23:57.600
communism book, I'm sorry, Marcuse and the Anthropocene that I covered in another episode of the

01:23:57.600 --> 01:24:02.400
podcast. This is their agenda. This is how they think. So degrowth is going to be the way to save

01:24:02.400 --> 01:24:12.800
the world. Idea 1510, 29th August 1998. We must deeply rethink our world's and humanity's future.

01:24:12.800 --> 01:24:19.040
It would be good to remember the fathers of the U.S. Constitution. How dare you? It would be good

01:24:19.040 --> 01:24:23.680
to remember the fathers of the U.S. Constitution who believed that the function of good government

01:24:23.680 --> 01:24:28.560
was to, quote, affect the greatest happiness of the greatest number of citizens and to affect

01:24:28.560 --> 01:24:36.320
harmony between the public and private interests, end quote. Today they would add, get their motherfucking

01:24:36.320 --> 01:24:42.960
names out of your mouth. Today they would add harmony with the earth in a worldwide dimension

01:24:42.960 --> 01:24:55.920
to the attaining of happiness. No, they wouldn't. You dickhead. Idea 1557, 15th October 1998. Speaking

01:24:55.920 --> 01:25:03.040
of identities, we should accept happily that we have a polyidentity. Our specific individual

01:25:03.040 --> 01:25:08.640
identity, a family identity, a local identity, a provincial identity, a national identity,

01:25:08.640 --> 01:25:16.560
a continental identity, a world identity, a cosmic identity, and eternal identity. The future earth

01:25:16.560 --> 01:25:23.440
and human government of this planet should take all of these diverse identities into account.

01:25:24.720 --> 01:25:30.480
It gets much worse in the next section based on ideas 1601 to 1700.

01:25:31.360 --> 01:25:38.080
This is where, like, New Genesis was pretty crazy and totally blasphemous. This is where the

01:25:38.080 --> 01:25:43.120
idea is actually getting nut job because it's his cosmological vision of the future.

01:25:44.720 --> 01:25:48.400
And I'm going to try to just, I have to read a lot of it and I'll try to just kind of slide

01:25:48.400 --> 01:25:53.120
through it as quickly as we can. I will try, this is Robert Mueller, I will try to condense

01:25:53.120 --> 01:25:59.360
briefly my thoughts on a cosmic vision of humanity's future. First of all, the most important factor

01:25:59.360 --> 01:26:05.760
determining our time is that in the entire human evolution on this planet, within the

01:26:05.760 --> 01:26:10.720
last couple of centuries and especially during the last 50 years, the human race has been able

01:26:10.720 --> 01:26:17.120
to extend its knowledge of this planet and of itself in such incredible ways that a profound

01:26:17.120 --> 01:26:24.240
transformation has taken place in evolution. This is the talk of eugenicists, guys. We now

01:26:24.240 --> 01:26:30.320
understand the mysteries of life, the mysteries of humans, the mysteries of the planet and the

01:26:30.320 --> 01:26:36.080
cosmos and now we can direct it because we understand it. We can take it into our hands,

01:26:36.080 --> 01:26:41.600
we can seize the means of production of man. He says, this knowledge has meant incredible

01:26:41.600 --> 01:26:47.760
benefits for humanity and I skip his big laundry list of them. The fundamental fact that we know

01:26:47.760 --> 01:26:53.840
our planet, that we know humanity, that we know how to analyze and recompose matter has produced

01:26:53.840 --> 01:26:59.440
miracles. Of course, we believed that the progress of science and technology was for the benefit of

01:26:59.440 --> 01:27:04.240
humanity. In other words, that our reason for being on this planet was to get the best for

01:27:04.240 --> 01:27:12.000
ourselves. This is the great humanistic age in which we are now living. But we did not know

01:27:12.000 --> 01:27:17.920
that these great advances would also result in a whole series of crises due to our global ignorance.

01:27:18.880 --> 01:27:23.040
Who ever thought of saving energy? Who ever thought of the ozoneosphere?

01:27:23.040 --> 01:27:28.720
Who ever thought of possible climactic changes? Who ever thought of the long-term genetic dangers

01:27:28.720 --> 01:27:34.320
of nuclear radiation and radio waves? I am asking this question today. What are the things we are

01:27:34.320 --> 01:27:39.920
doing today which we think are wonderful and in which in 20 years from now we'll have the same or

01:27:39.920 --> 01:27:45.280
worse adverse effects as a few examples I mentioned? Who is thinking of this? Who is

01:27:45.360 --> 01:27:51.040
heeding the Iroquois precept that we should think of the effects on the seventh generation?

01:27:51.040 --> 01:27:56.000
We do not even think of the next generation. There is not a single ministry of the future

01:27:56.000 --> 01:28:01.200
on this planet. Yikes. And I will point out that he actually in lots and lots and lots of the ideas

01:28:01.200 --> 01:28:05.920
invokes the idea that we need to go back to indigenous, especially American Indian,

01:28:06.560 --> 01:28:12.720
knowledges and epistemologies that comes up over and over and over again. I don't actually include

01:28:12.800 --> 01:28:17.840
any of them I think except for that mention, but it's not like a throw in here. It's like over

01:28:17.840 --> 01:28:23.120
and over and over again. Indigenous knowledges are the only way. Why? Because they are the model

01:28:23.120 --> 01:28:28.880
for communism. Remember Marx's model of communism? Communism is a global state where we all act like

01:28:28.880 --> 01:28:36.160
a big tribal family. That's why. Now skipping down some of this, so we can get to the crazy stuff,

01:28:36.160 --> 01:28:40.800
of late there has been another fundamental change on earth. Until now we thought that

01:28:40.800 --> 01:28:45.920
this planet was at our disposal, that it was created for us. Uh-oh Christians, there's your

01:28:45.920 --> 01:28:50.720
beliefs. That it was here for us to exploit and develop endlessly. I think the word in the Bible

01:28:50.720 --> 01:28:57.680
is subdued. Well, we are now in the middle of another Copernican revolution. We thought at

01:28:57.680 --> 01:29:02.480
the time that the sun was turning around the earth until we learned from Copernicus that it was not

01:29:02.480 --> 01:29:10.640
true. Now we're learning that perhaps this planet has not been created for humans, but that humans

01:29:10.640 --> 01:29:16.640
have been created for the planet. Uh-oh, there's your earth worshipping Gnostic,

01:29:18.560 --> 01:29:24.000
Gnostic theosophy. We return to the earth, he says, as our American Indians and the great

01:29:24.000 --> 01:29:30.240
religions have all told us. Thus we are temporary living manifestations or incarnations of this

01:29:30.240 --> 01:29:36.320
earth. Again, the American Indians tell us we are children of the earth and we must take good care

01:29:36.320 --> 01:29:43.520
of our mother and respect her. We are living earth. Each of us is a cell, a perceptive,

01:29:43.520 --> 01:29:50.000
nervous, active unit of the earth. We are earth alive and are beginning to be concerned about

01:29:50.000 --> 01:29:56.480
the earth. The living consciousness of the earth is beginning to operate through us. All over the

01:29:56.480 --> 01:30:04.080
world a kind of earth democracy, a gyrocracy is taking shape. What you're witnessing is the birth

01:30:04.080 --> 01:30:12.560
of a new pagan cult, by the way. You, as cosmic and earth cells, are part of a vast biological

01:30:12.560 --> 01:30:18.480
and evolutionary phenomenon which is of first importance at this stage, namely humanity as a

01:30:18.480 --> 01:30:24.560
whole. The whole human species is becoming the brain, the heart, the soul, the expression, and

01:30:24.560 --> 01:30:32.400
the action of the earth. Pause. Let's talk about Karl Marx, right? Remember when he said that the

01:30:32.480 --> 01:30:38.320
earth is man's inorganic body and that the point of part of our activity is that as we

01:30:38.320 --> 01:30:42.000
rehumanize ourselves, we're going to humanize the world and make the world fit for human

01:30:43.520 --> 01:30:48.480
habitation. So we're supposed to turn the earth, we're supposed to basically integrate the earth

01:30:48.480 --> 01:30:52.480
into ourselves and ourselves into the earth so that it were one symbiotic thing and that would

01:30:52.480 --> 01:30:56.960
of course avoid the metabolic rift the capitalism's going to produce and the whole point of degrowth

01:30:56.960 --> 01:31:01.680
which is the whole point of the concepts of the club of Rome that I just talked about and limits

01:31:01.680 --> 01:31:08.320
to growth. So the whole human species, as a species being, namely humanity as a whole, the whole

01:31:08.320 --> 01:31:13.440
human species, as a species being is becoming the brain, the heart, the soul, the expression,

01:31:13.440 --> 01:31:20.160
and the action of the earth. We now have a global brain which determines what can be dangerous

01:31:20.160 --> 01:31:26.160
or mortal for this planet. Yeah, and limits to growth, it was shitty computer models that he

01:31:26.160 --> 01:31:31.920
literally talks about. It's like the shitty computer models of COVID but go back to like

01:31:31.920 --> 01:31:37.040
1971 and imagine how shitty those computer models would be because that's what it literally,

01:31:37.040 --> 01:31:40.880
that's their global brain, is shitty computer models. But what that means is AI is a future

01:31:40.880 --> 01:31:46.640
global brain and it can determine what can be dangerous or mortal for this planet. The United

01:31:46.640 --> 01:31:51.920
Nations, what does he say is a colon here? What is the global brain according to Robert Mueller

01:31:51.920 --> 01:31:57.600
writing in 1998? We have a global brain which can which determines what can be dangerous or

01:31:57.600 --> 01:32:03.760
mortal for this planet and it is the United Nations and its agencies, the innumerable groups and

01:32:03.760 --> 01:32:11.200
networks around the world are part of this brain. We are a world heart. Altruism, which we haven't

01:32:11.200 --> 01:32:18.160
covered altruism in Augusta Comte yet but that's another bad philosophy. Altruism, the concern

01:32:18.160 --> 01:32:25.120
of people to be of help, the live aid and international programs, etc. All of this is a

01:32:25.120 --> 01:32:31.840
manifestation of the fact that on this planet after having evolved from protozoas to metazoas,

01:32:31.840 --> 01:32:40.640
we are now becoming what one would call terrazoas. We are living Earth that is beginning to be

01:32:40.640 --> 01:32:46.400
conscious of its role in the evolution of this particular planet in the universe. This is our

01:32:46.400 --> 01:32:54.720
newly discovered meaning, birth of a cult. It is happening every day and we have to draw the

01:32:54.720 --> 01:33:00.000
right conclusions from it. The world is changing very fundamentally in terms of consciousness,

01:33:00.000 --> 01:33:06.640
behavior and action. We know that we are a global family living in a global home. This is more or

01:33:06.640 --> 01:33:12.720
less where we stand. In other words, we are in the process of becoming a global civilization

01:33:12.720 --> 01:33:18.400
and yet this is not all there is more to come. Beyond our global consciousness, we are moving

01:33:18.400 --> 01:33:24.080
into a cosmic consciousness. Remember this is a guy that created Common Core just in case you forgot

01:33:24.080 --> 01:33:31.120
that. In other words, we learn to see the Earth process not only as a global planetary process

01:33:31.120 --> 01:33:37.520
but as a cosmic manifestation and evolution on a given planet in the universe. It is not impossible

01:33:37.520 --> 01:33:43.920
that the universe has not been able to produce many live planets like ours. We are at the right

01:33:43.920 --> 01:33:49.200
distance from a sun. We have the right mass to retain an atmosphere and water and we are very

01:33:49.200 --> 01:33:55.040
lucky that the force that keeps atoms together on this planet is just right. A little stronger

01:33:55.040 --> 01:33:59.680
and we would be a condensed ball, a little weaker and we would be dispersed into the universe.

01:33:59.680 --> 01:34:02.720
I hate to point out creationists but he's making the same argument you guys do.

01:34:02.960 --> 01:34:10.400
Our planet and its life forms are the result of many miracles and unique phenomena. The religions

01:34:10.400 --> 01:34:15.520
rightly say that this is a unique planet and that God has a special design for us. Science

01:34:15.520 --> 01:34:20.400
is now discovering that too. Mathematicians tell us that the conditions required to give birth to

01:34:20.400 --> 01:34:25.520
life on any planet in the universe are one of the most staggering astronomical improbability

01:34:25.520 --> 01:34:31.440
figures they can conceive. New cosmologies are being produced by the dozens but I do not think

01:34:31.440 --> 01:34:38.000
that anyone is as yet the right one. There are many different views. The physicists, the geneticists,

01:34:38.000 --> 01:34:43.440
the chemists, the spiritualists each have a view. Which one of those is not like the others?

01:34:44.320 --> 01:34:50.800
The idiots. I mean spiritualists. That's right. The theosophists. When I put your little dig there

01:34:50.800 --> 01:34:54.720
a second ago, Christians, this sounds exactly like you guys making your creation arguments.

01:34:54.720 --> 01:35:00.160
I told you the fundamental spiritual battle is theology versus that's you versus theosophy.

01:35:00.160 --> 01:35:04.560
That's them and they are stepping into the exact same space at the same time as you guys

01:35:05.440 --> 01:35:12.400
to try to make these claims and to bring people into their cult rather than keeping them in either

01:35:12.400 --> 01:35:19.440
reason or faith. He says, but it shows that there is an active search for a new cosmology,

01:35:19.440 --> 01:35:24.160
for a new understanding of what is happening on this planet where there are many life forms and

01:35:24.240 --> 01:35:29.840
where one of them namely the human form. Humans, remember we said before protozoan,

01:35:29.840 --> 01:35:37.680
metazoan, and terazoan? Okay humans are becoming cosmozoas. The main factor of the further evolution

01:35:37.680 --> 01:35:43.280
transformation and possibly destruction of the planet if we do not understand what is going on

01:35:43.280 --> 01:35:51.280
and act properly. You're witnessing the birth of a cult religion. This is something he says

01:35:51.280 --> 01:35:56.480
absolutely extraordinary because it means that each of us is a cosmic unit. Sounds like

01:35:56.480 --> 01:36:01.600
Deepak Chopra, right? He's one of them. That we have the ingredients of the total cosmos

01:36:01.600 --> 01:36:05.840
in ourselves. You only know who Deepak Chopra is by the way because they elevated Deepak Chopra

01:36:05.840 --> 01:36:09.440
because they needed somebody to go talk about this and have debates and become very famous pushing

01:36:09.440 --> 01:36:16.240
these ideas into the public. How many times was he on Oprah? Oh shit, lots. The cosmos is giving

01:36:16.240 --> 01:36:24.640
birth to billions of humans as seeds. Uh-oh. The cosmos is giving birth to billions of humans as

01:36:24.640 --> 01:36:31.120
seeds. Many seeds fall on stone or on infertile ground or do not understand what their duties are,

01:36:31.120 --> 01:36:36.640
but growing numbers of people understand that they have a cosmic function deep in themselves.

01:36:36.640 --> 01:36:39.680
See only some people are actually Gnostics and they know that they're going to have to direct

01:36:39.680 --> 01:36:45.920
the spiritual evolution of the entire human society or the entire human species and the

01:36:45.920 --> 01:36:52.160
planet itself and cosmic evolution. These people are esoteric theosophists. He says,

01:36:52.160 --> 01:36:57.040
if you look over history, who are the greatest people? You'll find the Mozart's, the Beethoven's,

01:36:57.040 --> 01:37:02.880
the philosophers, the sages, the religious leaders. They were all people of cosmic consciousness. Oh,

01:37:02.880 --> 01:37:08.160
all the geniuses were people like my cult. Of course they try to claim all the people in history

01:37:08.160 --> 01:37:15.440
like they always do. They were conscious of living in the cosmos in eternity and in the universe at

01:37:15.440 --> 01:37:21.280
every moment. Really? Mozart was? Like, fucking really? I don't think so. Isn't this like, you

01:37:21.280 --> 01:37:26.240
say this, the sages and the religious leaders? Isn't this like kind of fucking exactly what Elijah

01:37:26.240 --> 01:37:33.680
was like? Eh, no. Um, wrong. There's certainly Irenaeus, one of the greats, uh, cast down these

01:37:33.680 --> 01:37:39.920
heresies in the first century. He says, this is why we listen to them. Well, because they're in the

01:37:39.920 --> 01:37:43.840
cult. You know, they're all like hundreds of years ago before your stupid cult, but they were in the

01:37:43.840 --> 01:37:48.000
cult. And this is why we listen to them, because they're part of the cult. They're a vibration,

01:37:48.000 --> 01:37:52.960
he doesn't say this, I'm saying this, a vibration of the Prisciotheologia, the universal religion.

01:37:53.600 --> 01:37:58.880
This is why we listen to him. He says, when we read, uh, when we read them, when we see their

01:37:58.880 --> 01:38:04.160
works, we are deeply moved and elevated. Why? Because they are in tune with the universe and

01:38:04.160 --> 01:38:10.720
make us feel that way. This is what the religions are trying to sell us. Quote, be in tune with the

01:38:10.720 --> 01:38:15.840
universe. Be in union with God, with eternity. Remember that your temporary lives have a meaning,

01:38:15.840 --> 01:38:21.520
a duty to fulfill. End quote. And when we fulfill this duty, the universe recompenses us,

01:38:22.080 --> 01:38:28.800
recompenses us with a happiness, and possibly even resurrection. It is not impossible that the

01:38:28.800 --> 01:38:34.800
Hindu philosophy might be right. That only those who had worthwhile lives contributing to the good

01:38:34.800 --> 01:38:39.600
and the further evolution of this planet will be allowed to live again. And that worthless seeds

01:38:39.600 --> 01:38:45.840
will be left aside to wither away. The religions can be very helpful in understanding these new

01:38:45.840 --> 01:38:54.880
cosmologies. Let me just pause for a second. Holy shit. Okay. In other words, he says, humanity,

01:38:54.880 --> 01:39:01.040
the same way as it has become recently a global family, is also becoming now a cosmic family.

01:39:01.600 --> 01:39:08.720
This is the United Nations, gentlemen. We will realize that we are a cosmic species,

01:39:08.720 --> 01:39:13.920
which will find its way on this planet only by following the imminent rules of the cosmos.

01:39:14.720 --> 01:39:21.040
I'm sure, ladies, that they alone know those rules. And they're going to enforce them through

01:39:21.040 --> 01:39:26.720
one government, one global government, through the United Nations. Some call it God. Other is a

01:39:26.720 --> 01:39:32.480
cosmic substratum that is in each of us. It has the manifestation of the living universe divided

01:39:32.480 --> 01:39:38.320
and distributed over all reality. Well, there's the fundamental hermetic belief. It is possible

01:39:38.320 --> 01:39:43.840
that stars are just living and dying cells of one body the same way as we are living and dying

01:39:43.840 --> 01:39:53.120
cells of that same body. Let me pause again. Holy shit. This realization is of incredible

01:39:53.120 --> 01:39:59.440
momentous importance. It will occupy humanity and give us great hope and challenges. The story

01:39:59.440 --> 01:40:04.720
was told to us in simple forms by the religions, but now the scientists have come to the same

01:40:04.720 --> 01:40:11.040
conclusion that the universe is one in its endless manifestations. The recent scientific

01:40:11.040 --> 01:40:16.800
literature is replete with this finding. So the Gnostics know the secret interpretation of whatever

01:40:16.800 --> 01:40:22.400
it is he's talking about, and it's whatever they think. My proposal, he says, is therefore that

01:40:22.400 --> 01:40:28.640
we proceed toward the year 2000. Sorry, I left out the word as. My proposal is therefore that as we

01:40:28.640 --> 01:40:33.840
proceed toward the year 2000, we should pack this last decade with visions, dreams, ideas,

01:40:33.840 --> 01:40:40.880
and actions aimed at preparing the next millennium as the cosmic spiritual millennium of this planet

01:40:40.880 --> 01:40:46.960
in order to properly respond to the expectations of the cosmos or God. In order to do this,

01:40:46.960 --> 01:40:52.640
I will propose that a number of major conferences or efforts be undertaken which are not yet

01:40:52.640 --> 01:41:00.400
considered by the United Nations. Peace, disarmament, population, the environment, economic development,

01:41:00.480 --> 01:41:05.920
et cetera, are all subjects being dealt with in the UN. But here is a list of others

01:41:06.560 --> 01:41:11.840
which should be taken up in order to prepare adequately the next millennium. So he's about

01:41:11.840 --> 01:41:17.280
to give a list of suggestions that the United Nations needs to take up that it's not successfully

01:41:17.280 --> 01:41:21.920
taking up even though overpopulation and the environment are already part of the plan.

01:41:22.480 --> 01:41:29.040
How many suggestions do you think he makes? How many? It's 17. Of course, it's 17. Of course,

01:41:29.360 --> 01:41:36.080
it's 17. First, a major conference should be convened on a new cosmology. We just heard what

01:41:36.080 --> 01:41:40.720
that sounds like. One should listen to the physicists, to the biologists, to the other

01:41:40.720 --> 01:41:46.640
scientists, and to people who have come up with new cosmologies. That's the weirdo spiritualists,

01:41:46.640 --> 01:41:53.360
like them. From their views, one would extract a common denominator, a Priscotheologia. They all

01:41:53.360 --> 01:41:58.000
have very important perceptions, but these perceptions vary with the point of view of their

01:41:58.000 --> 01:42:04.320
professions, physical, biological, spiritual, social, political, et cetera. At the end of such a

01:42:04.320 --> 01:42:09.360
conference, we would have a better understanding of what the cosmos is expecting from us in our

01:42:09.360 --> 01:42:18.320
next phase of evolution. Second, I would recommend a major conference on a new philosophy, a global

01:42:18.320 --> 01:42:25.280
philosophy. Philosophy is the way of life. What should be the way of life on this planet in global

01:42:25.280 --> 01:42:31.600
terms in light of our fantastic knowledge? Where are the great sages of our time? Where are the

01:42:31.600 --> 01:42:37.040
positive philosophies who are giving us an explanation of the meaning of life and hope for the future?

01:42:37.040 --> 01:42:40.160
I'll tell you where the great sages are. You're censoring them. That's where they are.

01:42:42.320 --> 01:42:48.560
Third, a new sociology is needed, which will help us understand the meaning and role of all the

01:42:48.560 --> 01:42:54.400
innumerable groups, entities, professions, and institutions we have on this planet. Most of

01:42:54.400 --> 01:42:59.520
them have a contribution to make to the progress and success of our evolution. Many of them do not

01:42:59.520 --> 01:43:05.120
know it and have not even asked the fundamental deeper question of why they exist, why they were

01:43:05.120 --> 01:43:11.280
created, what their ultimate purpose and contribution should be in the total human fabric. Their limited

01:43:11.280 --> 01:43:17.280
aims and behaviors must be geared toward the needs of humanity, of the planet, and to the continued

01:43:17.360 --> 01:43:23.600
success of our cosmic evolution. This is a vast, unexplored, urgent subject.

01:43:25.040 --> 01:43:30.880
Fourth, we need a new anthropology, as Margaret Mead recommended. Remember, that's the mother of

01:43:30.880 --> 01:43:36.480
cultural relativism. We need world celebrations as we have them in the family and religions in

01:43:36.480 --> 01:43:42.240
nations. Humans in the world have to develop common paradigms, common ideals, and benchmarks for

01:43:42.240 --> 01:43:48.560
the future. The science of the total human race leaves much to be desired. We do more research

01:43:48.560 --> 01:43:54.880
on tribal systems than on global humanity, its meaning, evolution, and system. So we need a

01:43:54.880 --> 01:44:00.880
science of humanity, apparently. Fifth, we need an overall human biology. I wonder if it knows

01:44:00.880 --> 01:44:06.560
what a woman is. A science of human life on this planet, we study more animals and microbes than

01:44:06.560 --> 01:44:11.440
we study the functioning of the human species. To the biologists, this is political. It should not

01:44:11.440 --> 01:44:17.360
be so. The biologists should tell us very frankly and honestly how the human species functions,

01:44:17.360 --> 01:44:22.720
from their point of view as experts in life. If they do it for the fishes and the mammals,

01:44:22.720 --> 01:44:27.120
they can and should also do it for the human species. Well, they're biologists, so maybe they

01:44:27.120 --> 01:44:33.760
do know what a woman is, but it doesn't appear to be the case. Sixth, we need a global cosmic

01:44:33.760 --> 01:44:39.440
spirituality. We have heard religious leaders of various faiths. It was illuminating. I hope that

01:44:39.440 --> 01:44:44.480
religious leaders will get together and define before the end of this century the cosmic laws

01:44:44.480 --> 01:44:50.240
which are common to all their faiths. So there's a great ecumenical movement. And imagine if you

01:44:50.240 --> 01:44:57.440
tied that thing through the church to the businesses and called it the center for inclusive capitalism.

01:44:58.960 --> 01:45:03.680
They have been cosmic experts and interpreters of the heavens for a long time. They should tell the

01:45:03.680 --> 01:45:10.160
politicians what the cosmic laws are, what God or the gods or the cosmos are expecting from humans.

01:45:11.200 --> 01:45:16.560
It's good that we had last year the Oxford Conference of Parliamentarians, scientists,

01:45:16.560 --> 01:45:22.000
and religious leaders, and that in January 1990 a second conference will be held in Moscow.

01:45:22.000 --> 01:45:28.480
We must hope also that the Pope will come before the year 2000 to the United Nations, speak for all

01:45:28.480 --> 01:45:33.920
the religions and spiritualists on the planet, and give the world the religious view of how the

01:45:33.920 --> 01:45:38.960
third millennium should be a spiritual millennium, a millennium in which we will see the integration

01:45:38.960 --> 01:45:45.200
and harmony of humanity with creation, with nature, with the planet, with the heavens, and with eternity.

01:45:46.240 --> 01:45:52.080
Yeah, let the intergalists do it. Their system is an intergalistic system, by the way, just pointing

01:45:52.080 --> 01:46:01.280
that out. Seventh, we need a new world policy and political system. Uh-oh. This planet is mismanaged

01:46:01.280 --> 01:46:06.320
to an incredible degree. If the United States were managed like the world is managed, it would be a

01:46:06.320 --> 01:46:12.560
disaster. Nobody would understand how 50 states in the world has 185, each having a president

01:46:12.560 --> 01:46:17.920
to flag an army and absolute sovereignty could ever work together. Imagine the United States

01:46:17.920 --> 01:46:22.960
government in Washington being only a kind of United Nations without any authority, any legislative

01:46:22.960 --> 01:46:26.800
power, barely any resources. You mean kind of like the founding fathers thought it would be?

01:46:26.800 --> 01:46:33.120
It would be a disaster. Well, we have this disaster for the world, and it is about time we recognize

01:46:33.120 --> 01:46:39.760
it. Ken Keyes, I think that's how you say his name. Excellent book Planethood makes this point and

01:46:39.760 --> 01:46:45.520
offers a way for the political reform of this planet. The birth of the European Union, which was

01:46:45.520 --> 01:46:52.240
seen by Jean Monnet and Robert Schumann as the first step toward a world union, is the biggest

01:46:52.240 --> 01:47:01.440
harbinger of hope. How's that going for you now, fuckers? Eighth, we need a proper planetary

01:47:01.440 --> 01:47:06.560
management. Private firms and the multinationals must face up to the responsibilities for the

01:47:06.560 --> 01:47:12.960
management of the planet. Oh, ESG. They consider themselves responsible only to profits and

01:47:13.040 --> 01:47:17.040
stockholders. Well, it's becoming increasingly manifest that this planet was not created for

01:47:17.040 --> 01:47:22.240
the purpose of making money. We urgently need a science, a strategy, and a methodology for

01:47:22.240 --> 01:47:31.200
of proper management of planet Earth. There's ESG right there. And there is these big investment

01:47:31.200 --> 01:47:37.280
firms taking control of all of the private firms and multinationals for the responsibilities for

01:47:37.280 --> 01:47:44.880
the management of the planet. Environmental social and governance. Ninth, we need a new world,

01:47:44.880 --> 01:47:50.160
philanthropy. People are giving their wealth and monies to a hospital, to a local university,

01:47:50.160 --> 01:47:55.920
to a national foundation, or purpose. And the world gets little or nothing. The University for

01:47:55.920 --> 01:48:00.480
Peace here in the demilitarized Costa Rica is one of the most beautiful and useful projects on the

01:48:00.480 --> 01:48:04.720
Earth. But where are the philanthropists who are taking an interest in it with the exception of

01:48:04.720 --> 01:48:11.200
one or two? So he's not getting enough money for his own little stupid project. And yet it is here

01:48:11.200 --> 01:48:15.920
in this university where a new science of peace must be developed for this planet. Maybe we don't

01:48:15.920 --> 01:48:22.080
want that shit, dude. And thousands of peacemakers educated for a whole series of professions. Oh,

01:48:22.080 --> 01:48:27.120
great. More infiltration. The people have to take the financing of the world's care into their own

01:48:27.120 --> 01:48:32.320
hands. In other words, you taking it literally into your own hands and giving your money where you

01:48:32.320 --> 01:48:36.720
want is not adequate. So it's going to have to be channeled to what they want. So philanthropy is

01:48:36.720 --> 01:48:42.640
going to have to be globally coordinated to go to UN designated things. Got you. We do not even have

01:48:42.640 --> 01:48:47.600
an intergovernmental world budget. Well, if governments do not want to have a world budget,

01:48:47.600 --> 01:48:53.280
let the philanthropists and the people do it in their own way. A new world democracy will thus

01:48:53.280 --> 01:49:03.440
be born. 10th, we need a new world education, SDG 4. Global education, namely in the education

01:49:03.440 --> 01:49:07.760
of children and our global home and into the human family is making good progress.

01:49:08.960 --> 01:49:14.320
But we have to go beyond. We need the cosmic education foreseen by the religious and by people

01:49:14.320 --> 01:49:19.520
like Maria Montessori. We need a holistic education teaching the wholism of the universe and the

01:49:19.520 --> 01:49:24.560
planet. I am glad that one of the first graduates of the Robert Mueller School in Arlington, Texas,

01:49:24.560 --> 01:49:30.000
which teaches my world core curriculum will take the floor during this conference to announce the

01:49:30.000 --> 01:49:36.720
creation of a United Nations of Youth. How beautiful. So the guy who created Common Core says we need

01:49:36.720 --> 01:49:41.600
a new world global education. What's he going to focus on? Well, we now know and I'll do a podcast

01:49:41.600 --> 01:49:45.920
on this sooner or later, the UN's idea of global citizenship and global citizenship education.

01:49:46.000 --> 01:49:54.800
11th, we need a new world information. Outer space inspectors would be shocked by the wrong

01:49:54.800 --> 01:49:59.200
information that is being spread around the world. Uh oh, we've got to manage misinformation and

01:49:59.200 --> 01:50:04.000
disinformation. We need honest, objective, truthful information to guide our way and

01:50:04.000 --> 01:50:08.960
behavior and not manipulate information for all kinds of purposes. Iron law of vote projection

01:50:08.960 --> 01:50:14.960
never misses as we've now learned. Proper world information, communications and media are another

01:50:14.960 --> 01:50:21.760
subject of paramount importance. The United Nations and its 32 specialized agencies and world

01:50:21.760 --> 01:50:28.080
programs come closest to that which uh sorry come closest to what such an information system should

01:50:28.080 --> 01:50:36.640
be. 12th, we need a new world ethics. What is good for the United States, Russia or any other country

01:50:36.640 --> 01:50:42.320
like having atomic bombs and there are 40,000 in the world can be awfully bad for our planet.

01:50:42.320 --> 01:50:47.680
I'm sure that God or the cosmos has not created this planet to have all these nuclear detonators

01:50:47.680 --> 01:50:55.520
and its flesh and its water and its air and in the stars. Okay, I just have to stop there for

01:50:55.520 --> 01:51:01.920
a second. We haven't put any fucking nuclear weapons in any stars and stars are literally

01:51:01.920 --> 01:51:08.560
gigantic nuclear explosions of such vast proportions that we can't contemplate them. So

01:51:08.560 --> 01:51:14.400
if God made the stars, he did want nuclear fucking detonations in the stars. This guy is a

01:51:16.160 --> 01:51:22.080
sorry lost my temper. I'm sick of these crackpots. I really don't like these people. Anyway,

01:51:22.080 --> 01:51:29.040
and in the stars and in the stars, what are you adding that for you freaking moron? God.

01:51:30.560 --> 01:51:35.280
Our political leaders must be given to understand that they do not only have a responsibility

01:51:35.280 --> 01:51:40.400
toward their people and toward humanity, but toward the success of the extraordinary cosmic

01:51:40.400 --> 01:51:45.120
process. By the way, dude, the primary energy source of the extraordinary cosmic process is

01:51:45.120 --> 01:51:52.000
nuclear detonations in the stars. Perhaps unique in the whole universe unfolding on this planet,

01:51:52.880 --> 01:51:58.080
they might finish it or they might help and foster it. I know we kind of lost the plot on that one.

01:51:58.080 --> 01:52:02.720
New world ethics. So we've all got to have this new world global ethical system that's

01:52:02.720 --> 01:52:07.520
facilitated through their occult theosophical religion that's focused on a gyrocracy.

01:52:08.160 --> 01:52:13.600
Thirteenth, and we remember that 13 is the magical number of power in their numerology.

01:52:14.400 --> 01:52:19.920
Just like 17 is the magical number of one completed turn of transformation,

01:52:19.920 --> 01:52:26.160
13 is the power to turn that transformative wheel. So what do they say is 13th? What does he say?

01:52:26.160 --> 01:52:31.360
Robert Mueller, we need a new world science and technology. The scientists and the technologists

01:52:31.440 --> 01:52:36.960
must assume a cosmic responsibility. What they are doing might be right or wrong for humanity

01:52:36.960 --> 01:52:42.720
and for a further evolution. They have to think of the seventh generation and should place Orin

01:52:42.720 --> 01:52:47.520
Lyon's prayer on their desk. And I do not know what that refers to, but apparently it's written

01:52:47.520 --> 01:52:55.520
down in idea 899, which is I don't think in this document. Fourteenth, we need a new world economy.

01:52:55.600 --> 01:53:02.560
Oikos nomos means the management of the home. At long last, we recognize that planet earth

01:53:02.560 --> 01:53:09.200
is our home. We need a world economy in which all people have decent cosmic lives and perform

01:53:09.200 --> 01:53:14.000
the functions for which they were born. Sounds exactly like George Soros' idea of an open society

01:53:14.000 --> 01:53:20.160
or Herbert Marcus' idea of a liberated society or Marx's idea of a completed communism. It goes

01:53:20.160 --> 01:53:25.440
far beyond the new international economic order. It is a restructuring of the economy based on

01:53:25.440 --> 01:53:34.720
the ecology, Oikos logos, and the knowledge of our planet. We have to put our house, which is on the

01:53:34.720 --> 01:53:40.720
planet, in good evolutionary order to become a planet of extraordinary beauty, conservation,

01:53:40.720 --> 01:53:46.560
renewal, happiness, and justice for all. So we need an entire new world economy. I bet you it's

01:53:46.560 --> 01:53:54.240
going to work like agenda 30 by 30, where by the year 2030, that's the by 30 part, 30% of the world

01:53:54.240 --> 01:54:00.240
will be uninhabited and back to the wild and not used for any commercial or productive purpose.

01:54:02.480 --> 01:54:08.800
Fifteenth, we need a new world art. See the table framework for the planetary cosmic role of art

01:54:08.800 --> 01:54:13.600
and culture. I love the way they talk. The planetary cosmic role of art.

01:54:16.160 --> 01:54:20.560
We need a renaissance of art similar to the Italian Renaissance, which put things into harmony

01:54:20.560 --> 01:54:26.480
again. Modern art was the expression of our analytical period. We dissected everything.

01:54:26.480 --> 01:54:30.880
We now know it was probably propped up by crackpots who wanted to put ugly crap in front of us to

01:54:30.880 --> 01:54:37.840
demoralize us, frankly. Art has to be paid for. We now have to put everything into harmony again.

01:54:37.840 --> 01:54:43.840
We need a holistic universal art expressing our faith, sense of beauty, happiness, and planetary,

01:54:43.840 --> 01:54:49.520
humanistic cosmic consciousness. As all great poets, writers, painters, musicians, and sculptors

01:54:49.520 --> 01:54:55.520
have done in the past. The classic book by Richard Burke on cosmic consciousness gives us a whole

01:54:55.520 --> 01:55:01.680
list of such people. We also need world anthems like the one we heard this morning. Some of the

01:55:01.680 --> 01:55:07.440
sanguinary violent national anthems need to be rewritten. I think that that one might include

01:55:07.440 --> 01:55:12.560
the national anthem of the United States, the Star Spangled Banner, which is a very interesting

01:55:12.560 --> 01:55:16.560
national anthem because it's actually not about a war. A lot of people think it's about

01:55:16.560 --> 01:55:23.360
happening within a war. The first stanza of the Star Spangled Banner is a question.

01:55:24.880 --> 01:55:32.480
Is our flag still there? Are we still going to make it? We have a long, dangerous, perilous night

01:55:32.480 --> 01:55:39.200
in this war for our independence attacking us to establish this new nation of ideals and human

01:55:39.200 --> 01:55:45.440
liberty, and is it still there? That's the whole point, but I bet you, I bet you that's part of it.

01:55:45.920 --> 01:55:51.200
He says, I have a new text of the Marseilles written by young people, which starts with the words

01:55:52.080 --> 01:55:58.480
Aliens en font de la planète, come children of the planet. Why not? It is beautiful. I hope that

01:55:58.480 --> 01:56:03.040
the young people in Strasbourg will sing it on the occasion of the 200th anniversary of the French

01:56:03.040 --> 01:56:09.040
Revolution. Several national anthems have similarly been rewritten by young people. I have a whole

01:56:09.040 --> 01:56:18.480
file of them. That's great. No. 16th, we need a new world psychology. Does it know what a woman is?

01:56:19.120 --> 01:56:24.320
We must learn how to love our wonderful earth and miraculous humanity above anything else.

01:56:24.320 --> 01:56:29.600
Now we're being taught to love a nation or a group or a religion and to kill other human beings,

01:56:29.600 --> 01:56:38.160
other divine beings for them. Well, not really. I mean, some do that, but there is this whole

01:56:38.160 --> 01:56:43.040
just war concept where you get to defend yourself if people attack you or try to steal your stuff.

01:56:43.040 --> 01:56:49.760
I mean, there's a thing. This is contrary to nature and to cosmic divine laws. We have to love

01:56:49.760 --> 01:56:54.640
humanity. We have to love the planet. We have to love the universe and have to be their instruments

01:56:54.640 --> 01:56:59.120
during our short years on this earth. If we do not, life on this planet will come to an end.

01:56:59.680 --> 01:57:04.960
A completely new world psychology must lay down our right sentimental priorities. This is what

01:57:04.960 --> 01:57:14.080
Freud told Einstein, the idea 1020, in their famous exchange of views. 17th. And he starts this way,

01:57:14.080 --> 01:57:19.920
and this is very significant. 17th but not last. Let me tell you real quick. There's no 18. So it

01:57:19.920 --> 01:57:27.600
is 17th but last, but he inserts or insists 17th but not last. Why? Because it's a cycle of evolution.

01:57:27.600 --> 01:57:33.760
17 steps to turn history once. And then there will be 17 more steps to turn history again,

01:57:33.760 --> 01:57:39.440
another revolution. Revolutions in 17 steps. Marx identified 17 contradictions in capitalism.

01:57:40.000 --> 01:57:46.080
Paulo Freire said it takes 17 generative themes to radicalize or conscientize a learner.

01:57:47.040 --> 01:57:52.800
The Corpus Hermeticum has 17 books. I'm not going to get into the spiral of Theodorus and

01:57:52.800 --> 01:57:58.560
where this comes from from the Pythagorean mathematical numbers cult, but that's ultimately

01:57:58.560 --> 01:58:05.200
what it is. 17th but not last. We must teach the children of this planet a new art of living.

01:58:05.760 --> 01:58:11.280
Show them how great life is. How's that going for you guys? How's your comprehensive sexuality

01:58:11.280 --> 01:58:17.040
education working out for their precious little minds? It's killing them. We should teach them

01:58:17.040 --> 01:58:22.480
how thankful they should be to live today at this time of magnificent consciousness and the

01:58:22.480 --> 01:58:27.760
incredible knowledge of the universe, that it will be their role to be the right managers of the

01:58:27.760 --> 01:58:33.440
planet, that each of them is a cosmic unit or as Pablo Casals said, quote, a true miracle,

01:58:33.440 --> 01:58:38.720
a potential Leonardo or Beethoven. Therefore, you cannot hurt, you cannot kill another miracle,

01:58:38.720 --> 01:58:44.800
end quote. How's that working out guys? How's your, how are your things working out for that?

01:58:44.800 --> 01:58:53.360
Seems like you're lying. Yes, we are miracles, microcosms, cosmozoas of the universe. This must

01:58:53.360 --> 01:58:57.360
be taught to children so that they can flower to the responsibility for which they're born. In

01:58:57.360 --> 01:59:01.840
other words, global citizenship education, which is defined literally in terms of teaching them to

01:59:01.840 --> 01:59:08.320
meet the 17 Sustainable Development Goals of the United Nations Agenda 2030. We also have to teach

01:59:08.320 --> 01:59:13.840
frugality, the deep growth, and simple living in order not to destroy or tax unduly the beautiful

01:59:13.840 --> 01:59:20.720
creation of God. We should follow in the footsteps of St. Francis, who preached this 800 years ago.

01:59:20.720 --> 01:59:27.840
We should read Voluntary Simplicity by Dwayne Elgin. Simple frugal lives of five billion people

01:59:27.840 --> 01:59:33.520
are the most monumental contribution to the environment of this planet. Every human being

01:59:33.520 --> 01:59:39.360
should know that he or she is an instrument of God or the universe, be it as a mother who gives

01:59:39.360 --> 01:59:44.880
life to a child, as a new divine being, or as a father who in the family is raising a new cosmic

01:59:44.880 --> 01:59:54.240
unit, or an educator who is educating new cosmogens, or a doctor who will heal cosmic

01:59:54.240 --> 02:00:01.920
patients or public servants or artists, etc. There's 17. Then we will fully validate life and

02:00:01.920 --> 02:00:07.680
make children and people proud to be alive. How's that going for you guys? We gave you guys a 20

02:00:07.680 --> 02:00:13.920
year run on that. How's it going? Is that working? Is that what's happening? Then humans will respect

02:00:13.920 --> 02:00:19.840
their own miraculous divine cosmicity, as Buckminster Fuller said when he was offered cigarettes,

02:00:19.840 --> 02:00:24.160
quote, I will never do anything that might impair the functioning of the perfect cosmic

02:00:24.160 --> 02:00:30.720
unit I have been given by the universe, end quote. This is a language which we should hold to

02:00:30.720 --> 02:00:37.840
children. This would be the real fight against drugs, alcohol, and violent television and literature.

02:00:37.840 --> 02:00:44.640
How's that working out? You do not damage your incredible cosmic entity by introducing

02:00:44.640 --> 02:00:49.600
poisonous materials and images into its functioning. Can we talk about books like Gender Queer?

02:00:50.880 --> 02:00:54.640
Which is part of your comprehensive sexuality education stuff. Can we talk about what you're

02:00:54.640 --> 02:01:00.160
actually doing? We can validate life to an unprecedented degree and extend it to the

02:01:00.160 --> 02:01:05.280
largest and smallest manifestations of the universe. This should be the philosophy of the

02:01:05.280 --> 02:01:10.960
next century. I would like to conclude by saying that perhaps we should replace the popular recent

02:01:10.960 --> 02:01:18.560
saying, quote, think globally act locally by think cosmically act locally wherever you live

02:01:18.560 --> 02:01:25.040
on this miraculous planet. Thank you very much for giving me some of your precious cosmic time.

02:01:25.040 --> 02:01:32.080
Doesn't just make you want to punch this guy in the head. Idea 1633. So now we elaborate on this.

02:01:32.960 --> 02:01:40.320
29 December 1998. The word politics should be abolished and replaced by something much deeper.

02:01:40.320 --> 02:01:45.920
I like planetics, the management of our planet. But it's even deeper than that. What is happening

02:01:45.920 --> 02:01:51.360
on our earth is a whole series of fundamental biological evolutionary changes. We need to

02:01:51.360 --> 02:01:56.720
consider the biology and evolution of the earth in its entirety. This should be the only concern

02:01:56.720 --> 02:02:03.200
of government to manage the entire earth. The collective preoccupations of humanity should

02:02:03.200 --> 02:02:09.280
be for the state of the planet and the conditions and future of all life on it. The word politics

02:02:09.280 --> 02:02:14.960
must be abandoned. Politicians should become earth biologists and all faculties of political

02:02:14.960 --> 02:02:22.400
science faculties of earth biology and evolution. You get the idea that the United Nations sucks

02:02:22.400 --> 02:02:31.440
in a big way. Idea 1634. 30 December 1998. Human history proves that there are always

02:02:31.440 --> 02:02:37.520
very great barriers, obstacles to a peaceful just and harmonious world. In the past it was futility.

02:02:38.240 --> 02:02:43.840
Then the kingdoms and the empires. Today it is nationalism and tomorrow it will be the big

02:02:43.840 --> 02:02:49.360
multinational companies. It is a mistake to hope that these barriers will disappear by themselves.

02:02:50.000 --> 02:02:54.480
All human history proves that they have to be dismantled in order to be replaced by something

02:02:54.480 --> 02:03:00.640
else. We have reached that point of modern history where both nationalisms and big multinational

02:03:00.640 --> 02:03:08.720
corporations must be dismantled and replaced by something else. It has to come from an outside

02:03:08.720 --> 02:03:15.040
force, a people's revolution or revolution of the scientists, thinkers, visionaries,

02:03:15.040 --> 02:03:21.920
prophets, globalists, futurologists and synthesizers of this planet. So there you have the global

02:03:21.920 --> 02:03:26.240
agenda. We have to get rid of nationalisms and start thinking in terms of global citizenship.

02:03:26.240 --> 02:03:31.280
And there you have ESG. Big multinational corporations are dismantled. None of them

02:03:31.280 --> 02:03:37.520
can do what they want on their own. They are all owned by one another and act in monopoly trust.

02:03:37.520 --> 02:03:42.320
They are not what they were before. They are dismantled and replaced by something else that

02:03:42.320 --> 02:03:49.440
works in line with ESG and United Nations agendas. Why are so many companies so hell bent to achieve

02:03:49.440 --> 02:03:57.040
their agenda 2030 net zero targets? Because they've been dismantled and replaced by something else.

02:03:57.040 --> 02:04:02.640
It's not multinational corporations even, which are their own set of problems. They are monopoly

02:04:02.640 --> 02:04:11.360
trusts that act in the interest of the United Nations agenda. Idea 1708. Regarding globalization,

02:04:11.360 --> 02:04:17.120
one could take my world core curriculum, C volume one, and envisions the globalization and

02:04:17.120 --> 02:04:23.200
futurization of every segment of it. An individual can globalize himself. Families can globalize

02:04:23.200 --> 02:04:28.880
themselves. States, province, departments, that is, local levels of government could globalize

02:04:28.880 --> 02:04:34.320
themselves by creating world associations for local communities, states, provinces, etc.

02:04:34.880 --> 02:04:39.520
It would be a benefit to them to learn how other subdivisions like theirs are governed,

02:04:39.520 --> 02:04:45.440
legislated, and administered elsewhere in the world. It would be an incredibly rich reciprocal

02:04:45.440 --> 02:04:50.480
experience. So that's the idea of global citizenship, which is to be implemented on every

02:04:50.480 --> 02:04:55.680
single level. It kind of takes the idea of subsidiarity and turns it inside out and on its head.

02:04:57.680 --> 02:05:01.920
Yeah, the local stuff is all going to work, you know, as much authority as possible is going to

02:05:01.920 --> 02:05:06.000
be put into local hands, but they are all going to have to be transformed to only do the big global

02:05:06.000 --> 02:05:12.480
or I guess cosmic agenda that's coordinated through the central coordinating and cooperation

02:05:12.480 --> 02:05:17.520
facilities of the United Nations and its new world religion. So if you get everybody in the

02:05:17.520 --> 02:05:22.080
new world religion, you can tell them that they manage their own affairs as maximally as possible,

02:05:22.080 --> 02:05:26.480
but it's because they all follow the same religion. So that's why it's so important for them to take

02:05:26.480 --> 02:05:34.080
over and transform all the faiths into one corrupt global faith. And that's why this isn't,

02:05:34.080 --> 02:05:39.680
like if you don't understand that this cult theosophy is in fact a cult religion,

02:05:39.680 --> 02:05:44.000
a global cult religion startup, then you're missing the entire point.

02:05:45.040 --> 02:05:51.920
Idea 1745. On the occasion of the year 2000, governments and the diplomatic community should

02:05:51.920 --> 02:05:56.960
pay attention to the proposals for a better United Nations offered by Harold Stassen,

02:05:56.960 --> 02:06:02.560
one of the world's last living members who signed the charter. He sees the United Nations change

02:06:02.560 --> 02:06:06.240
from a place where meetings on political, economic and social issues are held

02:06:06.240 --> 02:06:11.680
into a creative center where ideas on religion and philosophy are exchanged for a better future.

02:06:11.680 --> 02:06:16.880
Among his proposals are a central cabinet of administrators, a universal environmental

02:06:16.880 --> 02:06:25.520
institute, a United Nations legion, an inspection corp, a world panel of mediators, a world

02:06:25.520 --> 02:06:32.960
board of arbitration, a world court of equity, a worldwide conference on religions, and a research

02:06:32.960 --> 02:06:38.320
institute of people and government. His book should be read by every delegate to the United

02:06:38.320 --> 02:06:45.040
Nations, by every head of state before coming to the year 2000 General Assembly, and in all

02:06:45.040 --> 02:06:50.080
political science faculties of universities throughout the world. So yeah, they're kind of

02:06:50.080 --> 02:06:57.040
after like everything. So that's, you've now got a taste of how crazy it is. And those 17 points

02:06:57.040 --> 02:07:03.760
and the whole new genesis were the real big points. This is your United Nations. So I'm going to close

02:07:03.760 --> 02:07:08.960
by reading three more of these ideas, and that's it. But I wanted you to have a sense that the

02:07:08.960 --> 02:07:12.720
United Nations is not what you think it is. The United Nations, what you might think is if you're

02:07:12.720 --> 02:07:16.400
one of my followers, but generally speaking, people don't realize what the United Nations is.

02:07:16.400 --> 02:07:22.080
The United Nations is an organization that is wholly dedicated to global governance under an

02:07:22.080 --> 02:07:28.480
occult, theosophical religion. And if we don't understand what we're dealing with, we're going

02:07:28.480 --> 02:07:34.400
to completely misunderstand what we need to be doing. The United States, it said, needs to decline.

02:07:34.400 --> 02:07:40.800
Why? Because we're not in alignment, or we can be not in alignment with their program. This is why

02:07:40.800 --> 02:07:45.360
they freaked out when Trump took office. Trump actually pulled us back from all of this. He

02:07:45.360 --> 02:07:50.480
removed us from UNESCO. They know that he was going to put America's interests ahead of their

02:07:50.480 --> 02:07:55.760
theosophy, and that was why they have to attack the United States so vigorously. And that's why

02:07:55.760 --> 02:08:01.200
they do attack the United States so vigorously, because the United States, in its fully constituted

02:08:01.200 --> 02:08:06.560
form, and its constitution at its heart, is the biggest threat to this cult religion trying to

02:08:06.560 --> 02:08:11.360
take over the world that there is. But I'll close with, like I said, three more of these ideas,

02:08:12.160 --> 02:08:19.280
so we don't drag this out. Idea number 562, 25 January 1996. Last but not least,

02:08:19.840 --> 02:08:25.040
humanity has reached a point when we must consider our human presence, past, present,

02:08:25.040 --> 02:08:30.240
and future on this particular planet in the universe. We now have a tremendous information,

02:08:30.240 --> 02:08:34.160
sorry, no, that's what it says. Sorry, I didn't read it right. We now have a tremendous information

02:08:34.160 --> 02:08:39.840
on the universe in which we live. In addition to our total consciousness of our earth and its global

02:08:39.840 --> 02:08:46.400
evolution, we are now also acquiring and developing a cosmic consciousness of the universe. This is

02:08:46.400 --> 02:08:53.680
the greatest of all our advances in human history, so their cult is. But the mysteries of infinity

02:08:53.680 --> 02:08:59.200
and eternity still escape us and will remain outside of human and scientific grasp. This has

02:08:59.200 --> 02:09:05.280
the result of bringing together the spirituality or basic faiths of all religions and science.

02:09:05.840 --> 02:09:12.160
Faiths, by the way, is in scare quotes. This has the result of bringing together the spirituality

02:09:12.160 --> 02:09:20.320
or basic, quote, faiths of all religion and science. God, the gods, or the great spirit,

02:09:20.320 --> 02:09:26.880
or spirits, or their emissaries, prophets, and human incarnations like Jesus, gave humanity its

02:09:26.880 --> 02:09:34.480
early stages of a cosmic universal, all-encompassing faith or feeling for the mysteries of the cosmos,

02:09:34.480 --> 02:09:40.560
for the norms of love and for the miracle of life and norms of behavior between all humans

02:09:40.560 --> 02:09:48.000
and with all other species and nature. That's claiming an awful lot. These messages, or quote,

02:09:48.000 --> 02:09:53.040
revelations, should not be neglected. Uh-oh, they probably something should happen to them like

02:09:53.040 --> 02:09:58.800
them being transcended. They contain some of the most, some of the profoundest answers to human

02:09:58.800 --> 02:10:03.680
behavior, fulfillment, and survival. Great was our astonishment in the environmental crisis

02:10:04.320 --> 02:10:09.600
to discover the wisdom and rules of behavior toward nature dictated by the great spirit to

02:10:09.600 --> 02:10:15.840
the indigenous people of this planet. The world's 5,000 religions are filled with incredible wisdom

02:10:15.840 --> 02:10:22.160
regarding human morality, belief in life, environmental adaptation, survival, and future

02:10:22.160 --> 02:10:29.280
evolution. This is strongly coming to the fore at this time as manifested in the following.

02:10:30.400 --> 02:10:33.920
But let me pause before we talk about the following because I want to go back to the

02:10:33.920 --> 02:10:40.880
Jesus part here. Uh, so God, the gods, or the great spirit, or spirits, and their emissaries,

02:10:40.880 --> 02:10:46.800
prophets, and human incarnations like Jesus. So all of these characters, Jesus is just one of many.

02:10:46.800 --> 02:10:53.840
Jesus is just another Buddha who gave humanity at its early stages a cosmic consciousness. So this

02:10:53.840 --> 02:10:59.040
is the rise, you've heard this phrase recently probably if you're too tapped in on social media,

02:10:59.040 --> 02:11:04.320
this is the rise, and this is part of the new thought movement that this is all, all into.

02:11:04.320 --> 02:11:08.960
This is the rise of the idea of the Christ consciousness. And of course the Christ consciousness

02:11:08.960 --> 02:11:13.440
is the awakened cosmic consciousness this guy's talking about. And this Christ consciousness

02:11:13.440 --> 02:11:18.320
was supposed to be embodied by Jesus and many of the other great sages and buddhas of history,

02:11:18.320 --> 02:11:24.720
and also the gurus, or the shamans, or whatever else. But Christ consciousness is a counterfeit.

02:11:24.720 --> 02:11:32.720
It is not at all biblical. It is a heretical, theosophical idea. And it is actually on the

02:11:32.720 --> 02:11:40.080
rise again. And you need to be sensitive to seeing that because the battle at a spiritual level,

02:11:40.160 --> 02:11:47.120
spiritual battle we're engaged in is theology versus theosophy. Jesus didn't stutter. He didn't

02:11:47.120 --> 02:11:53.600
say there's a bunch of us that are like me. He didn't say that. He said he is the way of the

02:11:53.600 --> 02:12:00.960
truth in the life. He said the way is straight and narrow. Many, you know, the path of many is

02:12:00.960 --> 02:12:06.880
the path of destruction. He's very clear about what's going on. He said to, he said to follow

02:12:06.960 --> 02:12:10.560
the law. Which law was he talking about? The law of the universe? No.

02:12:11.840 --> 02:12:17.360
He claims, or the Gospel of John claims that he is the logos itself made flesh. So he is,

02:12:18.080 --> 02:12:22.800
in addition to whatever else on a more profound spiritual level, he is literally the embodiment

02:12:22.800 --> 02:12:31.840
of truth. This is not what's being presented. This is a Gnostic counterfeit of that. So the Gnostic

02:12:31.840 --> 02:12:36.080
New Thought Movement is embodied. If you go listen to, you can listen to people like Deepak Chopra

02:12:36.080 --> 02:12:40.880
and all these guys that are their mouthpieces. Look up the phrase Christ consciousness and see

02:12:40.880 --> 02:12:45.360
what comes up. I haven't done it, but I'm so confident that what you're going to find is crazy

02:12:45.360 --> 02:12:51.200
theosophical stuff that I'm not worried telling you to do it. Okay, so all of this is in our next

02:12:51.200 --> 02:12:55.440
stages of evolution is strongly coming to the fore at this time. He said, has manifested in the

02:12:55.440 --> 02:13:01.760
following. One, the dream and plan of my compatriot Robert Schumann from Alsace-Lorraine

02:13:02.720 --> 02:13:06.880
to see the European Union, which started with a coal and steel community, followed by an

02:13:06.880 --> 02:13:14.560
economic community, followed by a political union, culminate in an all spiritual European Union,

02:13:14.560 --> 02:13:19.840
including the Eastern European countries, especially Holy Mother Russia.

02:13:21.600 --> 02:13:27.680
Let that one sink in. Two, the creation in 85 countries, including as a third party in the

02:13:27.680 --> 02:13:33.360
United States of the Natural Law Party. Based on the premise that the laws of nature should guide

02:13:33.360 --> 02:13:39.600
humans and their political behavior and organization, there is only one step to recognize that natural

02:13:39.600 --> 02:13:44.800
laws are in reality cosmic laws. So they're going to take the concept of natural law, pervert it,

02:13:44.800 --> 02:13:48.880
if they were to get their way with this, and then say that that's a step in their cosmic

02:13:48.880 --> 02:13:52.320
evolution. It's the same Gnostic thing I talked about in the past where they say, yeah, yeah,

02:13:52.320 --> 02:13:57.200
yeah, the thing you've got, that's really wise. And that's also stepped like four out of 10. Come

02:13:57.200 --> 02:14:03.280
with us, I've got the other six. And cosmic, astral, blah, blah, blah, is coming down the

02:14:03.280 --> 02:14:08.400
pike and only they secretly understand it. Three, the San Francisco, and this is the one I really

02:14:08.400 --> 02:14:14.000
wanted to hit, the San Francisco Initiative to Create a United Religions Organization similar

02:14:14.000 --> 02:14:20.000
to the United Nations, also born in that city, where all religions of the world could cooperate,

02:14:20.000 --> 02:14:25.520
define what they have in common, provide their wisdom on human behavior and morality,

02:14:25.520 --> 02:14:31.600
and write relations with nature and the creation of God, which I don't know if that's a pun,

02:14:31.600 --> 02:14:38.560
I assume that it's relations with the creation of God, but maybe they mean the act of creating God.

02:14:39.440 --> 02:14:44.320
In the process, they will hopefully reduce and progressively give up their fundamentalism,

02:14:44.960 --> 02:14:49.120
and in other words, actually believing their real faiths in favor of some theosophy,

02:14:49.840 --> 02:14:54.160
they will hopefully reduce and progressively give up their fundamentalism in favor of a global

02:14:54.160 --> 02:15:00.000
spirituality, the same way as nations in the United Nations have reduced the national fundamentalism

02:15:00.000 --> 02:15:07.840
called sovereignty, and given away their sovereignty to the United Nations to govern their affairs from

02:15:07.840 --> 02:15:15.120
a remote, unaccountable, theosophical cult that we should be getting as far away from

02:15:15.120 --> 02:15:22.480
as humanly possible. He goes on to say, may God help us that a world conference be convened

02:15:22.480 --> 02:15:29.280
on proper earth government through what the world's religions have in common in terms of

02:15:29.280 --> 02:15:34.720
universal global spirituality and worldwide human experience, in other words, a Prisket theologia.

02:15:36.240 --> 02:15:39.360
So that was one idea, 1998.

02:15:41.760 --> 02:15:48.080
20 years ago, I wrote an essay on the need for global education. Today, I would write an essay on

02:15:48.080 --> 02:15:53.600
the need for evolutionary education. Tomorrow, I would write an essay on the need for cosmic

02:15:53.600 --> 02:15:58.400
education. So I want to phrase those things in different words. I'm just going to say the same

02:15:58.400 --> 02:16:06.320
thing. 20 years ago, I wrote an essay on the need to develop common core. Today, I would write an

02:16:06.320 --> 02:16:11.760
essay on the need for a social and emotional learning. And tomorrow, I would write an essay

02:16:11.760 --> 02:16:18.640
on the need for global citizenship education. That's what it's going on. That's who this guy is.

02:16:19.200 --> 02:16:23.920
And we did the first two of those, and we're working on the third. And the United Nations is

02:16:23.920 --> 02:16:29.440
actually behind all three of them. And it's all based in a cult theosophical religion that they're

02:16:29.440 --> 02:16:34.880
using education to bring your children into, even though it's damaging to them, even though they know

02:16:34.880 --> 02:16:40.240
that it causes severe anxiety, depression, and cognitive dissonance, that they can then use

02:16:40.240 --> 02:16:45.520
the social emotional learning techniques, which are effectively brainwashing techniques, to override

02:16:45.520 --> 02:16:52.080
in the kids. I did that whole podcast on that document called SEL for SDGs, social emotional

02:16:52.080 --> 02:16:56.480
learning for the Sustainable Development Goals. So there you go. You can read the Sustainable

02:16:56.480 --> 02:17:00.880
Development Goals as evolutionary education and global citizenship as the next step after we

02:17:00.880 --> 02:17:09.280
achieve that spiritual, which is the common core, and then material, and that sustainability, and

02:17:09.280 --> 02:17:19.200
then, sorry, I did it wrong. Ideal, that's the common core. And then material, that's the sustainable

02:17:19.200 --> 02:17:26.160
development education. And then spiritual would be global consciousness or cosmic consciousness,

02:17:26.160 --> 02:17:31.200
I guess, which is global citizenship education. He goes on to say, after World War II, humanity

02:17:31.200 --> 02:17:36.240
acquired beyond national consciousness, a global consciousness. See, it's about global citizenship

02:17:36.320 --> 02:17:40.640
education. Today, humanity is acquiring an evolutionary consciousness. A consciousness

02:17:40.640 --> 02:17:46.560
is a future. Tomorrow, humanity will acquire a cosmic consciousness. After World War II,

02:17:46.560 --> 02:17:52.960
the United Nations was born as the planet's first global organization. Today, the United Nations is

02:17:52.960 --> 02:17:57.760
becoming the planet's evolutionary organization. So it's not meant to be a facilitator of global

02:17:57.760 --> 02:18:04.320
cooperation. It's meant to direct the evolution of mankind. Tomorrow, he says the United Nations

02:18:04.320 --> 02:18:12.080
will become the planet's first cosmic organization. This is a cult theosophical organization.

02:18:13.040 --> 02:18:18.720
With humanity's transcendence into cosmic consciousness and space and in time,

02:18:18.720 --> 02:18:25.680
the sciences and religions will converge into an all-encompassing, holistic, spiritual age

02:18:25.680 --> 02:18:31.200
dreamt of by our ancestors, prophets, visionary saints, and earthly incarnations of the divine

02:18:31.840 --> 02:18:39.040
cosmic forces over eons of time. In other words, Prescott theologia. Our future, he says, is

02:18:39.040 --> 02:18:45.280
incredibly bright and hopeful if we hasten these processes and think in time of ways to face

02:18:45.280 --> 02:18:52.960
very likely emergencies. Isn't that telling? So the goal is to create a one-world theosophical

02:18:52.960 --> 02:18:56.960
religion that blends all of the faiths, all the sciences, all the philosophies, all of the

02:18:56.960 --> 02:19:04.960
activities into one thing, one all-encompassing, holistic, spiritual age dreamt of by all of the

02:19:04.960 --> 02:19:11.760
cosmic forces over eons of time. Wow. And we will have a bright future if we hasten toward that

02:19:11.760 --> 02:19:15.840
and prepare ourselves to face very likely emergencies, which seems to be what the World

02:19:15.840 --> 02:19:21.840
Economic Forum decided it was going to do. And what the UN subsidiary, the World Health Organization,

02:19:21.840 --> 02:19:30.000
decided to switch its mission from coordinating various things about diseases and medicines

02:19:30.000 --> 02:19:36.320
and things like that to whatever the hell it's doing now trying to claim sovereignty over the

02:19:36.320 --> 02:19:41.360
world, which we just heard that sovereignty was the problem that has to be overcome. National

02:19:41.360 --> 02:19:47.200
sovereignty has to be destroyed. And in similar, he said literally in similar ways to the way that

02:19:47.200 --> 02:19:51.680
we're overcoming national sovereignty to a globalist consciousness, we need to overcome individual

02:19:51.760 --> 02:19:58.800
faiths and fundamentalism to a global theosophical occult religion. And I think last but not least

02:19:58.800 --> 02:20:06.160
idea number 1982. He says in idea 502 in volume two, I listed the three main periods through

02:20:06.160 --> 02:20:13.360
which the United Nations and humanity have gone since 1945. One, humanism, two, the environment,

02:20:13.360 --> 02:20:20.880
and three, the earth as number one. In these last 500 ideas, I mentioned a fourth period,

02:20:20.880 --> 02:20:25.120
our future evolution. That's the really crazy pants part of the document, by the way, that I was

02:20:25.120 --> 02:20:30.560
reading through was a reflection on those. Of course, these are ideas 500-ish and those were

02:20:30.560 --> 02:20:35.920
ideas 1600-ish, so it's not identical. I'm not saying that, but that's what he actually reflects

02:20:35.920 --> 02:20:41.680
there is these three phases. And then the fourth one is our future evolution. So anyway, as he

02:20:41.680 --> 02:20:46.960
continues, it suddenly occurs to me that the United Nations is still structured according to the

02:20:46.960 --> 02:20:52.880
needs and philosophy of the first period, namely humanism, with the objectives of peace, well-being,

02:20:52.880 --> 02:20:59.120
health, labor, food, education, culture, human rights, etc. The structure of the United Nations

02:20:59.120 --> 02:21:05.680
system does not reflect adequately the other three recent and equally fundamental preoccupations

02:21:05.680 --> 02:21:12.800
except the environment. A basic restructuring of the United Nations and its specialized agencies

02:21:12.800 --> 02:21:18.720
must therefore be considered to make it the principal central organization of the earth

02:21:18.720 --> 02:21:24.400
and future evolution. We should create a world air and atmosphere agency, a world water agency,

02:21:24.400 --> 02:21:30.720
a world climate agency, a world ocean agency, a world outer space agency, etc. Within these

02:21:30.720 --> 02:21:36.720
fundamental aspects of the earth, we should consider the place, action, and fulfillment of

02:21:36.720 --> 02:21:42.400
the human species. This reform should become a priority on the agenda of world affairs

02:21:43.600 --> 02:21:49.360
at this beginning of a new century and millennium. And I think that's exactly what they did.

02:21:49.360 --> 02:21:54.480
That's exactly what happened. The United Nations, however bad or whatever it was in its inception

02:21:54.480 --> 02:22:01.600
at the beginning, in the 21st century, in the third millennium, became a monster. And that monster is

02:22:01.600 --> 02:22:07.120
completely imbued with a cult theosophical view of the world and of humanity and of its mission in

02:22:07.120 --> 02:22:12.720
the world. I don't think that disagrees with its founding from the Huxleys, but just to point out

02:22:12.720 --> 02:22:17.600
it was being said at the time that the United Nations was not making this change satisfactorily

02:22:17.600 --> 02:22:23.120
by high level people in the United Nations. But that's what it turned to become. That's what it

02:22:23.120 --> 02:22:29.280
has become. And that's what we're dealing with when we look at the United Nations. It is the

02:22:29.280 --> 02:22:37.760
headquarters of a world theosophical cult. It is not what it appears to be. We should have

02:22:38.480 --> 02:22:43.600
nothing to do with it. So I hope that we can start thinking about this more. I'm going to,

02:22:43.600 --> 02:22:49.840
in the notes for this episode, put a link to all four volumes, not just this particular document,

02:22:49.840 --> 02:22:55.280
but all four volumes of Robert Mueller's ramblings and Robert Mueller's website,

02:22:55.280 --> 02:23:01.280
so that you can go look through the other God knows how many ideas, almost 2,000 ideas yourself.

02:23:01.280 --> 02:23:09.280
I didn't even read a hundred of them. So that you have a real sense of how insanely dangerous

02:23:09.280 --> 02:23:12.800
the United Nations really is. And I just want you to remember who this guy is. He was a very

02:23:12.800 --> 02:23:17.360
high level player in the United Nations. He is the creator of something we're going to be talking

02:23:17.360 --> 02:23:21.760
more about. And I encourage you to listen to Lisa Logan about this, this group called the

02:23:21.760 --> 02:23:26.160
Evolutionary Leaders. These are very important people that you think you don't know about,

02:23:26.160 --> 02:23:30.400
that it's going to sound totally insane when you find out about them. So we'll probably hear

02:23:30.400 --> 02:23:36.240
more about that as we go. But he was also the creator of the Common Core curriculum, in line

02:23:36.240 --> 02:23:43.840
with trying to get exactly these corrupt values pushed into these religious values, pushed into

02:23:43.840 --> 02:23:49.440
education. I don't think Common Core succeeded. I think the primary effect Common Core had in

02:23:49.440 --> 02:23:54.320
practice was to separate the ability for parents to help their children do homework,

02:23:54.320 --> 02:23:58.960
and thus disconnect them so that the children became more reliant on the teachers. And as we've

02:23:58.960 --> 02:24:03.120
moved into social and emotional learning and global citizenship education and education for

02:24:03.120 --> 02:24:09.360
sustainable development, they've been able to take advantage of that broken chain from parent to child

02:24:09.360 --> 02:24:16.000
and take the children in this other direction. In other words, indoctrinating them into this

02:24:16.000 --> 02:24:23.920
theosophical cult of what they consider to be Earth worship for the direction of mankind and

02:24:23.920 --> 02:24:31.600
Earth's future evolution on every possible level. Again, the conclusion is simple. We had it right

02:24:31.600 --> 02:24:36.720
when we made them mad. We should pull away from the United Nations as quickly and thoroughly as

02:24:36.720 --> 02:24:41.360
possible. We should discredit the United Nations. We should reject everything the United Nations

02:24:41.360 --> 02:24:44.640
tries to impose on us at whether it's the local level, the state level,

02:24:44.640 --> 02:24:50.000
ideally eventually at the United States federal level, and we should defund it completely. It is

02:24:50.000 --> 02:24:55.840
time for us to recognize the United Nations as an evil cult, and it is time for us to abolish the

02:24:55.840 --> 02:24:57.280
United Nations.
