Checking New Discourses/An Open Letter to Woke Youth.txt
1. **The State of Young Adults**: You're at a crossroads where your actions now will significantly impact your future due to the current societal shifts and the rise of woke ideology. Employers are increasingly wary of hiring young adults who may be indoctrinated with woke ideologies, as they fear such individuals could be unproductive, disruptive, or even litigious.

2. **Woke Ideology**: Woke Marxism is not about genuine liberation; it's about seizing privilege and power. It presents itself as a path to liberation but is actually a means of control, using individuals as resources to be exploited for the movement's ends.

3. **The False Promise of Liberation**: The promise of liberation from woke ideology is a deceptive trap. History shows us that those who lead liberation movements often end up imposing tyranny. Real liberty, not false liberation, must be fought for and preserved.

4. **The Biblical Cautionary Tale**: The story of the serpent and Eve serves as a timeless warning about the dangers of seeking liberation at the cost of truth and reality. It's a reminder that we cannot free ourselves from the constraints of a free society without leading ourselves into tyranny.

5. **The Importance of Choices**: Your generation is crucial in shaping the future. The choices you make now will determine whether you support freedom or succumb to tyranny. It's imperative to resist the siren call of woke ideology and instead fight for the preservation and restoration of liberty.

In essence, the message is a call to action for young adults to deprogram themselves from woke ideologies, to understand the true nature of the movement they are involved with, and to choose to preserve and fight for the liberties that have allowed them to think freely in the first place.

Checking New Discourses/Hegel, Wokeness, and the Dialectical Faith of Leftism.txt
1. **Hegel's Influence on Wokeness**: The speaker has argued that modern wokeness is deeply rooted in Hegelian philosophy, specifically the dialectical process of thesis, antithesis, and synthesis, which is a cornerstone of neo-Marxist thought. This process is used by woke ideologues to constantly deconstruct and redefine social norms and values.

2. **Historical Trajectory**: The speaker traces the lineage of this Hegelian influence from the Young Hegelians through to contemporary wokeness, suggesting that this progression has been a 200-year endeavor with a history that includes Marxism and other radical ideologies.

3. **Calamitous Outcomes**: The speaker asserts that wherever Hegelian thought has obtained power, it has led to negative outcomes, citing examples of the calamity brought by these ideologies in various countries.

4. **Ideological Conflict**: The speaker urges liberals and conservatives to unite against the advancement of this Hegelian leftist agenda, emphasizing the importance of pushing back against its influence and power.

5. **Christianity vs. Wokeness**: The speaker points out that woke ideology is heretical to Christian faith, as it contradicts the belief in a transcendent God and introduces a Hegelian view of deity that evolves through human actions.

6. **Rejection of Hegelianism**: The speaker calls for a rejection of Hegelianism on various grounds, including its unfounded claims, ethical implications, and the threat it poses to individual rights and liberties, which are based on the belief in rights endowed by a creator rather than granted by the state.

7. **Defense of Liberal Values**: The speaker advocates for the defense of liberal values that underpin Western societies, emphasizing that these values are at odds with the collectivist and statist views of Hegelianism and its contemporary manifestations in wokeness.

In summary, the speaker's argument is that wokeness, as a modern ideology, is deeply influenced by Hegelian philosophy, which seeks to continuously revolutionize society through dialectical conflict. This influence is seen as detrimental to both Christian theology and liberal democratic values. The speaker calls for a broad coalition of individuals across the political spectrum to unite against this Hegelian leftist ideology and to uphold the principles that have historically defined Western societies.

Checking New Discourses/Queer Theory Is the Doctrine of a Sex-Based Cult.txt
1. **Truth as a Core Principle**: The speaker emphasizes the importance of truth in all matters, particularly in the face of ideological manipulation and lies, such as those promoted by gender ideology. They warn against the dangers of succumbing to pressure from organizations like the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC), which may attempt to coerce individuals through fear of losing personal or familial assets.

2. **The Power of Truth**: The speaker draws inspiration from Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn's belief that one person telling the truth can bring down a regime. They encourage individuals to tell the truth and to stand firm in their convictions, as this can lead to a domino effect, uncovering hidden facts and ultimately challenging and dismantling false narratives.

3. **Investigative Action**: The speaker advises people to actively seek out the truth by researching, questioning, and reporting on revelations related to gender ideology, such as those found in WPATH documents or other sources of information. They suggest that individuals should dig deeper into who funds these ideologies and report their findings.

4. **Protecting Children**: It's crucial for parents to protect their children from the influence of harmful ideologies by providing them with a safe and nurturing environment free from manipulation.

5. **Breaking Cult Control**: By consistently telling the truth, questioning the narrative, and defending common sense, individuals can weaken the control that cult-like movements have over people. The speaker suggests that exposing the manipulative tactics of these movements diminishes their power.

6. **Opposing Abuse**: Queer theory, as a doctrine of a cult religion based on sex, is described as inherently abusive and manipulative, especially in its targeting of children. The speaker calls for awareness and opposition to such ideologies.

7. **Educational Efforts**: The speaker references their book with Logan Lansing titled "The Queering of the American Child" as a resource to learn about and oppose these ideologies. They encourage continued education on the subject and sharing that knowledge with others.

8. **Future Exposés**: The speaker teases upcoming releases of additional documents and information that will further expose the truth behind certain ideological movements.

9. **Engagement and Responsibility**: The speaker concludes by thanking listeners for their engagement and reiterates the responsibility each person has to seek out the truth, oppose deceptive practices, and protect the well-being of themselves and their children.

Checking New Discourses/The Occult Theosophy of the United Nations.txt
1. Aldous Huxley's great-grandson, Robert Mueller, authored a four-volume series called "The Purpose of the United Nations" where he outlines the evolution of the UN's purpose across different periods. These phases include humanism in its infancy, followed by an era focused on technology and science, a period centered around nationalism or state sovereignty, and finally, the current phase which is increasingly moving towards addressing global issues like climate change, water scarcity, and environmental sustainability.

2. Mueller argues that the UN's structure has not kept pace with these evolving concerns and suggests a reorganization to better reflect the current preoccupations with global challenges such as the environment, peacekeeping, and human rights. He proposes creating specialized agencies for issues like air and atmosphere, water, climate, oceans, and outer space.

3. Mueller's ideas reflect a worldview influenced by Theosophy, which is evident in his advocacy for a global, theosophical approach to addressing humanity's place on Earth. This perspective is deeply embedded in the UN's mission and its activities.

4. Despite criticisms of the UN's slow adaptation to contemporary issues, the organization has indeed shifted towards a more theosophical orientation, as evidenced by its current focus on sustainable development, global citizenship, and social and emotional learning—all aligned with the broader goals of what Mueller describes.

5. The conclusion drawn is that the United Nations should be seen as a harmful cult-like organization, and efforts should be made to distance ourselves from it. This includes discrediting its initiatives, rejecting its influence, defunding it, and eventually aiming for its abolition. The United States and other nations should work towards disengaging from the UN's control and directing our own policies and education systems independently of its influence.
