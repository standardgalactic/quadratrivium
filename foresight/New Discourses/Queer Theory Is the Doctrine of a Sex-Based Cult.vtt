00:00.000 --> 00:23.840
Here everybody, it's James Lindsay, you're listening to the New Discourses podcast and

00:23.840 --> 00:26.160
it's time to talk some more about queer theory.

00:26.960 --> 00:30.400
I want to make the case, and I suppose there's a bit of billion ways I could do this,

00:30.400 --> 00:33.600
I want to make the case that queer theory is the doctrine of a sex-based cult.

00:34.400 --> 00:41.360
That's it. In other words, to put it more frankly, or more clearly I suppose, queer theory,

00:41.360 --> 00:49.840
which pretends to be an academic discipline, is the doctrine of a religious cult that primarily

00:49.840 --> 00:57.680
targets children, and that is based on sex and topics related to sex, and that sex meant in both

00:57.680 --> 01:04.560
meanings of the word, both the biological fact and the activity, which is related to the biological

01:04.560 --> 01:13.680
fact incidentally, and it has very little to do with gay identity. So those are the main points

01:13.680 --> 01:18.160
of contention. Some of you will recognize, if you're readers as well, that what I'm going to do

01:18.160 --> 01:27.680
in this episode is actually summarize, or mostly run through and ad-lib off of a essay that I

01:27.680 --> 01:34.560
published on New Discourses in February after I gave this as a talk in Pittsburgh at the University

01:34.560 --> 01:40.000
of Pittsburgh, which is the one where people dressed as clowns came to protest me. And if you

01:40.000 --> 01:45.760
remember that image on the website, you know what I'm talking about. It was an amusing little story.

01:46.720 --> 01:52.880
The clowns were outside, I didn't see them, then the clowns came in, I did see them, and there was

01:52.880 --> 01:59.920
one clown actually and her friend, and about five minutes into the talk, about the time I'd given

01:59.920 --> 02:04.960
like the basic introduction and some serious facts, she started crying, got up and left,

02:04.960 --> 02:10.160
and called her mom so loudly that you could hear her kind of blubber into the phone,

02:10.800 --> 02:18.160
hey mom, as she walked out, and no further incidents were recorded. But the way I started

02:18.160 --> 02:22.720
off was as strongly as possible by saying exactly what I just said. I'm here to talk about queer

02:22.720 --> 02:26.960
theory and its major points can be summarized very easily. Queer theory is the doctrine of a

02:26.960 --> 02:33.040
religious cult that religious cult is based on sex. That's not the same as saying a sex cult,

02:33.040 --> 02:38.560
by the way, that's actually different. It is based on sex in both regards, but it's not necessarily

02:39.520 --> 02:46.560
sex as an activity oriented cult. And that sex based religious cult primarily targets children

02:46.560 --> 02:51.280
and almost none of it has anything to do with gay people or gay identity. And all of that is

02:51.280 --> 02:57.120
actually demonstrable in their literature. The least obvious of these points is that last point

02:57.120 --> 03:02.320
that has nothing to do with gay people, and it's a great place to start. And the way I make this

03:02.320 --> 03:07.200
case, I could point to an awful lot of their academic literature, drag queen story hour,

03:07.200 --> 03:13.280
which I read their academic paper about drag pedagogy in the groomer school series,

03:13.280 --> 03:18.720
I think it was groomer schools four. I read that paper talks about how the point of drag queen

03:18.720 --> 03:24.800
story hour is not actually for LGBT empathy. It's not even about LGBT identity. It's about awakening

03:24.800 --> 03:29.600
a queer potential, queer horizon, living queerly, alternate modes of kinship, blah, blah, blah.

03:30.480 --> 03:34.240
In other words, what queer theory is doing is hiding behind the gay identities,

03:34.240 --> 03:38.080
and it doesn't even have much to do with them. The gold standard proof in their literature

03:38.080 --> 03:46.000
comes from David Halperin, which he's a scholar who is the one who defined queer in queer theory

03:46.000 --> 03:52.560
in his book from 1995 called Saint Foucault Toward a Gay Hagiography, which means toward

03:52.560 --> 03:58.960
making him into a saint. Now Saint Foucault refers to Michel Foucault. People have heard me say Saint

03:58.960 --> 04:04.400
Foucault referencing the book, particularly I did it at Oxford in my debate, and they thought I

04:04.400 --> 04:09.280
was making a joke. No, it's literally the title of the friggin book. And you can actually go look

04:09.280 --> 04:14.000
at this book and read how horrifying it is. It's impossible actually on anything that you want

04:14.000 --> 04:20.960
to publish, you know, FCC guidelines or even the much looser online guidelines to read this book

04:20.960 --> 04:27.840
to you, because it's too blatantly inappropriate. I mean, it occasionally talks about topics

04:28.800 --> 04:33.520
like I don't even want to say it because I don't want the video to get demonetized.

04:35.120 --> 04:40.320
Let's just say that it refers to putting fists in certain orifices very explicitly and refers to

04:40.320 --> 04:46.880
it as a liberatory practice, and calls it anal yoga explicitly. I mean, you can get the book

04:46.880 --> 04:51.600
and to search the term anal yoga, and you're going to find all of this right there in the book.

04:52.560 --> 04:59.520
It's pretty shocking to read like a lot of queer theory, but David Halpern's book is kind of the

04:59.520 --> 05:03.920
gold standard for defining the word queer. It's where the word queer was first defined. It's

05:03.920 --> 05:10.320
like the first major treatise that lays out queer theory as queer theory and what it's aiming to

05:10.320 --> 05:14.960
accomplish. Obviously, given the title, it's building off of the ideas of Michel Foucault,

05:14.960 --> 05:22.320
who is this French postmodernist. He's also a pedophile. He was also a BDSM gay man. He

05:23.360 --> 05:31.520
bragged about his experiences in bathhouses in San Francisco and elsewhere. There's some

05:31.520 --> 05:39.760
very unfortunate stories regarding male children or boys around 11, 12, 13 in Tunisia that have come

05:39.760 --> 05:47.280
out at any rate. That's who he's harkening back to, and what he's really pushing back to, he could

05:47.280 --> 05:53.360
get into discipline and punish, birth of the clinic, civilization and madness, some of Foucault's

05:53.360 --> 05:59.120
kind of groundbreaking, I guess, if you want work in what we would recognize now as critical

05:59.120 --> 06:05.520
constructivism. But in this case, it's mostly the history of sexuality and primarily history

06:05.520 --> 06:11.840
of sexuality volume one. And Foucault in that book is laying out what is the idea of a homosexual

06:11.840 --> 06:16.800
in a very kind of parallel way to what Simone de Beauvoir was doing, laying out the concept of

06:16.800 --> 06:24.800
what is a woman in the second sex in 1949. Although, allegedly, Foucault was not copying

06:24.800 --> 06:28.960
Beauvoir. I don't know if that's the case or not. I'm not going to get into it. I'm not going to try

06:28.960 --> 06:32.880
to parse it out today. What I am going to say, though, is that it's the same idea, is that the

06:32.880 --> 06:37.600
homosexual should be defining himself on his own terms, and those terms have to be defiant to the

06:37.600 --> 06:44.240
heterosexual, homosexual binary, and the power constructions built around it. And this idea

06:44.240 --> 06:50.080
of an oppositionally defiant identity, political identity, against norms and expectations is what

06:50.080 --> 06:59.040
Halperin said means queer. And in fact, he says that it means queer, where Foucault says the

06:59.120 --> 07:06.880
homosexual, it can only be interpreted to mean queer. I probably have that citation somewhere

07:06.880 --> 07:12.880
and could pull it up to read it to you, but I didn't plan to. I don't think I put it in this essay,

07:12.880 --> 07:19.520
but it's an eye opener. But I'm going to read some from St. Foucault as it is,

07:20.240 --> 07:29.440
just so that you can have a sense that this is not about gay identity. So the first words of

07:29.440 --> 07:36.560
this relevant definition appear on page 62. That's the page in this book. You have to read 61 pages

07:36.560 --> 07:43.120
of Jesus Christ. Could you just shut you weirdos before you get to the point where he defines

07:43.200 --> 07:49.920
queer? And here's how that paragraph starts. The first three words, which are by a type setting

07:50.560 --> 07:58.400
quirk, are in bold all caps are unlike gay identity. So when he sets out to define queer,

07:58.400 --> 08:03.600
the first thing he says is it is unlike gay identity. It's something different than gay.

08:03.600 --> 08:09.840
Queer is not the same as gay. This is why he had to do his whole exploration about the homosexual

08:10.800 --> 08:14.160
from Foucault, because it's something different.

08:18.400 --> 08:27.760
So what he explains the difference is, is that gay identities, as Halpern puts it,

08:27.760 --> 08:33.280
are grounded in a positive fact. That means something about reality. They are grounded in

08:33.280 --> 08:42.000
the positive fact of homosexuality. Now Halpern does not actually say that gay is something that

08:42.000 --> 08:48.560
is intrinsic and essential to the person as an accident of birth, because he says that it's grounded

08:48.560 --> 08:56.480
in the positive fact of homosexual object choice. That's his actual phrase, which means that it

08:56.480 --> 09:05.280
might be the choosing of same-sex desire. He doesn't go so far as to say it's innate,

09:05.280 --> 09:14.000
but he does say that it's real, the positive fact of homosexuality. Queer, he is contrasting to that,

09:14.000 --> 09:18.720
and he says explicitly that it need not be based on any positive truth or in any stable

09:18.720 --> 09:24.480
reality at all. And he says there is nothing in particular to which it refers. Queer doesn't

09:24.480 --> 09:29.680
mean anything in particular is what he's saying. He calls it an identity without an essence. That

09:29.680 --> 09:38.560
means, unlike gay identities, it is not based in reality. So what is queer if it is not based in

09:38.560 --> 09:44.560
reality? It is a radical political view. In fact, if we want to pull from the Antonio Gramsci ideas

09:44.560 --> 09:51.120
of cultural Marxism, it is a counter hegemonic idea. There's this idea that we have prevailing

09:51.120 --> 09:56.080
cultural values and they tend to maintain themselves and transmit themselves and stabilize

09:56.080 --> 10:05.680
people and themselves, and that's cultural hegemony. The way things are, and queer is a defiant

10:05.680 --> 10:12.240
oppositional position against that. In other words, it's counter hegemonic. Just like Antonio

10:12.240 --> 10:18.240
Gramsci said, the point of what we now call cultural Marxism or Western Marxism is to establish

10:18.320 --> 10:22.720
counter hegemonic infiltration into our institutions. So bringing queer theory into

10:22.720 --> 10:27.760
institutions, whether education, law, whatever happens to be, media doesn't matter.

10:28.800 --> 10:34.080
Bringing queer theory into institutions is a counter hegemonic activity in line with

10:34.080 --> 10:41.280
Gramsci's Western Marxism, which we often call cultural Marxism. Halperin tells us that queer

10:41.280 --> 10:48.720
means adopting a politics that is against whatever the normal, the legitimate, and the

10:48.720 --> 10:55.200
dominant are. And so you can tell I'm not just making it up. Here's exactly how he phrases it.

10:55.760 --> 11:01.280
Unlike gay identity, which though deliberately proclaimed in an act of affirmation is

11:01.280 --> 11:07.520
nonetheless rooted in the positive fact of homosexual object choice, queer identity

11:07.520 --> 11:14.560
need not be grounded in any positive truth or in any stable reality. As the very word implies,

11:15.200 --> 11:21.600
queer does not name some natural kind or refer to some determinate object.

11:22.480 --> 11:29.280
See, it's not real. It acquires its meaning from its oppositional relation to the norm.

11:30.080 --> 11:37.120
Queer is by definition whatever is at odds with the normal, the legitimate, the dominant.

11:37.120 --> 11:43.760
There is nothing in particular to which it necessarily refers. It is an identity without

11:43.760 --> 11:50.320
an essence. Now, I'm cutting off here a lot of how actually psychotic David Halperin is

11:51.120 --> 11:56.880
when I present it this way. I have the book open, so I'll just read to you a little bit more. He

11:56.880 --> 12:03.440
says queer then demarcates not a positivity, that means something real, but a positionality,

12:03.440 --> 12:09.440
that means a politics, vis-a-vis the normative. Here's where it gets weird. They can't leave it

12:09.440 --> 12:15.040
alone. A positionality that is not restricted to lesbians and gay men, so it's not really about

12:15.040 --> 12:22.560
being gay, but is in fact available to anyone who is or feels marginalized. You don't even have to

12:22.560 --> 12:29.520
be marginalized. You just have to feel marginalized because of her or his sexual practices. It could

12:29.520 --> 12:36.000
include some married couples without children, for example, or even, who knows, some married couples

12:36.000 --> 12:42.800
with children, with perhaps very naughty children. I'm just going to pause. What the hell is he

12:42.800 --> 12:46.480
talking about? I'll let you speculate. What the hell is he talking about? Why does he say that it

12:46.480 --> 12:51.520
could be couples who are married with very naughty children, very naughties and italics? What does

12:51.520 --> 12:59.200
he mean here? Why do they always go there? But I'll continue the rest of the page. Queer, he says,

12:59.200 --> 13:05.440
in any case, does not designate a class of already objectified pathologies or perversions,

13:05.440 --> 13:14.160
so it's not just about that. Rather, it describes a horizon of possibility, just like communism

13:14.160 --> 13:19.840
is a horizon of possibility for socialist praxis. It describes a horizon of possibility

13:19.840 --> 13:27.040
whose precise extent and heterogeneous scope cannot, in principle, be delimited in advance.

13:28.000 --> 13:36.160
It is queer Marxism, in other words. It is from the eccentric positionality occupied by the queer

13:36.160 --> 13:46.080
subject, so it's subjective. It's not real, that it may become possible to envision a variety of

13:46.080 --> 13:53.040
possibilities for reordering the relations among sexual behaviors, erotic identities, constructions

13:53.040 --> 14:04.080
of gender, forms of knowledge, regimes of enunciation, logics of representation, modes of self-constitution,

14:04.800 --> 14:11.520
and practices of community for restructuring, that is, the relations among power, truth,

14:12.080 --> 14:18.720
and, of all things he could pick, desire. This is why in the Drag Queen Story Hour paper,

14:18.720 --> 14:23.760
it says explicitly that Drag Queen Story Hour, or Queer Worldmaking, as I think what it actually

14:23.760 --> 14:31.520
says, Queer Worldmaking, is always a project rooted in desire. He underscores his point, though,

14:31.520 --> 14:35.840
that it's not about gay identities by saying that it's not restricted to lesbians and gay men,

14:35.840 --> 14:42.720
but in fact that it's open to anyone who is or feels marginalized because of his or her sexual

14:42.720 --> 14:45.840
practices. So what are we dealing with? We're dealing with something that doesn't have a lot

14:45.840 --> 14:51.440
to do with gay identity at all when we're talking about queer and thus queer theory,

14:52.160 --> 14:58.880
and we're talking about something that is rooted in sex because of his or her sexual practices.

14:58.880 --> 15:05.040
It's right there in the text, it's extremely clear. But what is the conclusion that we draw from this

15:05.040 --> 15:11.760
discussion that Halpern gives us, the defining characteristic of queer in queer theory? It

15:11.760 --> 15:18.240
is that you cannot be queer. Do you understand me? There's no such thing as a queer identity.

15:18.960 --> 15:28.560
There is, let me say it again, no such thing as a queer identity. You can only do queerness. You can

15:28.560 --> 15:34.480
only act queer, and that's what it is. It's an act, and that's why with Judith Butler's work,

15:34.480 --> 15:39.840
we see that her work could boil down to drag is life and life is drag, and that the enlightened

15:39.840 --> 15:44.320
people or the people who know we're always doing a drag performance. What do I mean by that? If I'm

15:44.320 --> 15:49.840
a man and I present as a man and look like a man and act like a man and am a man, I'm just doing

15:49.840 --> 15:56.160
male drag as a man. And if I'm a woman and I'm doing female drag, or I'm sorry, if I'm a woman

15:56.160 --> 16:02.960
and I present myself as a woman and live according to feminine choices and stereotypes

16:02.960 --> 16:07.520
and activities and so on, I'm just doing female drag. And if I'm a male who does female drag,

16:07.520 --> 16:12.640
I'm still just doing drag, but now I've chosen to do it. I'm not just doing it like a socialized

16:12.640 --> 16:21.360
robot. I'm awake and I've chosen to do that in a defiance of the norm. So nobody is queer. People

16:21.360 --> 16:28.160
feel queer against some standard. In other words, they feel defiantly opposed. And I keep using this

16:28.160 --> 16:32.480
language, by the way, oppositional defiant. Oppositional defiant. Why? Because there's a

16:32.480 --> 16:37.120
disorder known as oppositional defiant disorder, which seems to fit the bill here.

16:38.880 --> 16:47.600
They are people who feel and act against the norm and against legitimacy on purpose. So they are

16:47.600 --> 16:54.480
not queer. They are acting queerly. And that means they are acting defiantly against normalcy and

16:54.480 --> 17:03.280
legitimacy, while denying and even decrying reality. You can only perform queerness. That's

17:03.280 --> 17:09.040
what Judith Butler's work is really about, gender performativity. You can only perform queerness,

17:09.040 --> 17:13.280
but they think everything is a form of queerness. You just don't know. You're either upholding

17:13.280 --> 17:21.520
the status quo, or you're rejecting it. So you can only perform queerness, or if you refuse

17:21.520 --> 17:27.680
their liberatory politics as they see them, you can perform straightness instead. Performing

17:27.680 --> 17:32.960
straightness to queer theory isn't being who you are if you're straight, just like gender

17:32.960 --> 17:37.680
performance. It's just another kind of performance, one that upholds the allegedly oppressive status

17:37.680 --> 17:44.400
quo instead of opposing it, which is thus problematic. We see the same theme in the

17:44.400 --> 17:50.480
Drag Queen Story Hour paper from a couple of years ago. Let me see if I actually found this

17:50.480 --> 17:58.400
other quote from Foucault, just to kind of really drive in the point. I know that I have it in this

17:58.400 --> 18:04.320
other document. Yeah, he says, this is Halpern talking about Foucault, the homosexual. He says,

18:04.320 --> 18:09.600
Foucault insisted that homosexuality did not name an already existing form of desire, but was rather

18:10.240 --> 18:15.840
something to be desired. So it doesn't describe a way of being romantically or sexually attracted

18:15.840 --> 18:23.440
to people. It's something that you want to become. It's an identity you seek to become.

18:24.080 --> 18:28.720
He says, our task is therefore to become homosexual, that's quoting from Foucault,

18:28.720 --> 18:35.040
not to persist in acknowledging that we are homosexual. Or to put it more precisely,

18:35.040 --> 18:41.200
what Foucault meant is that our task is to become queer. For his remarks make sense only if he

18:41.200 --> 18:46.640
understood the term homosexual according to my definition of queer. Remember we're reading David

18:46.640 --> 18:52.960
Halpern here. As an identity without an essence, not a given condition, but a horizon of possibility,

18:52.960 --> 18:59.760
an opportunity for self-transformation, a queer potential. Because one can't become homosexual

18:59.760 --> 19:08.080
strictly speaking. Either one is or one isn't. But one can listen to this shit. One can marginalize

19:08.080 --> 19:16.560
oneself. One can transform oneself. One can become queer. Indeed queer marks the very sight of gay

19:16.560 --> 19:25.520
becoming. So that is what Halpern is saying is the point of queer theory. And that's what meshes

19:25.520 --> 19:30.800
with the dry queen story hour paper that I was about to jump to. So I just want to remind you

19:30.800 --> 19:35.920
that in that paper there is a section near the end titled From Empathy to Embodied Kinship. It makes

19:35.920 --> 19:41.280
the same point we just made. That section makes the point that queer programs are presented as

19:41.280 --> 19:48.560
improving LGBT empathy in their words. And that dry queen story hour makes use of such tropes again

19:48.560 --> 19:53.600
their word. It then says that that's not really what dry queen story hour is about at all.

19:55.600 --> 19:59.920
It says that's not what queer education or queer world making are about either.

20:00.480 --> 20:05.840
Instead they use the so-called tropes of empathy strategically, that's their word,

20:05.840 --> 20:12.240
as a marketing platform. That's their word too. To justify getting it into schools, libraries,

20:12.240 --> 20:18.960
and in front of kids. But it's actually not about empathy at all. It's about leading the kids to see

20:19.600 --> 20:25.440
the world in themselves in a queer way. In other words to lead them into a queer worldview. World

20:25.440 --> 20:33.360
views, by the way, have ideologies. The ideology of the queer worldview is queer theory. So it is the

20:33.360 --> 20:39.440
doctrine of a sex-based cult that primarily targets children should add through manipulation and

20:39.440 --> 20:44.480
deception. And it has very little to do with gay people. Here's how it's worded in the dry queen

20:44.480 --> 20:49.120
story hour paper in the relevant part. Finally they say it is often assumed that that's Lil Miss

20:49.120 --> 20:54.880
Hot Mess and Harper Keenan. Drag queen at Arizona State University, whose real name is Harris

20:54.880 --> 21:03.600
Cornstein. And Harper Keenan is a trans education researcher somewhere, I don't know, maybe Canada.

21:04.480 --> 21:09.520
Finally they say it is often assumed that the primary pedagogical tool of queer education

21:09.520 --> 21:14.720
should be to increase empathy toward LGBT people. That's what you've heard. That's why we're supposed

21:14.720 --> 21:19.280
to have drag queen story hour because we have to care about the poor little gay kids who don't have

21:19.280 --> 21:24.080
representation and apparently needed a drag queen to look at to feel represented. They go on to say

21:24.080 --> 21:29.360
while this premise has some merit and it underlies many sincere projects and educational and cultural

21:29.360 --> 21:34.400
work including drag queen story hour, the notion of empathy has also been critiqued by feminist

21:34.400 --> 21:39.840
scholars of color and others for the ways in which, notice they throw that intersectional

21:39.840 --> 21:44.880
kitchen sink. This is about drag queens but it's been critiqued by feminist scholars of color and

21:44.880 --> 21:51.600
others for the ways in which empathy can enable an effective, emotional effective, A effective

21:51.600 --> 21:57.360
with an A not an E, an effective appropriation of an individual's unique experiences and

21:57.360 --> 22:02.240
reinforce hierarchies of power. That's a lot. But what they're saying is that when you can start,

22:03.200 --> 22:08.000
basically that you can do munch housings by proxy, you can start to show empathy in order

22:08.000 --> 22:12.320
to elevate yourself and thus cause problems for the people you're allegedly empathetic toward.

22:13.280 --> 22:18.560
Whether through literature or virtual reality, these tropes tend to reflect an overstated ability

22:18.560 --> 22:23.680
to understand difference as well as empathy's potential to preclude meaningful relationships

22:23.680 --> 22:29.680
of solidarity. See, you can't be in solidarity with somebody you feel sorry for. They go on and

22:29.680 --> 22:34.560
say it is undeniable that drag queen story hour participates in many of these tropes of empathy

22:34.560 --> 22:42.240
from the marketing language the program uses to its selection of books. And here it is. Much of

22:42.240 --> 22:50.320
this is done strategically in order to justify its educational value. However, we suggest that drag

22:50.320 --> 22:56.640
supports scholars' critiques of empathy rather than reifying the concept. Reifying in the sense of

22:56.640 --> 23:01.600
George Lukacz, one of the other founders or fathers of cultural Marxism, to means to make real

23:02.560 --> 23:10.560
through social processes. This approach can, this is them again, this approach can support

23:10.560 --> 23:16.000
students in finding the unique or queer aspects of themselves rather than attempting to understand

23:16.000 --> 23:22.320
what it is like to be LGBT. So what they're telling you is that the point is grooming people into a

23:22.320 --> 23:28.320
queer ideological worldview, children in particular, not about increasing empathy. It's not about

23:28.400 --> 23:32.960
understanding. Duh, obviously, they aren't putting a drag queen in front of the kids because it's

23:32.960 --> 23:38.080
trying to teach kids what it's like to be gay. Drag queens are a horrific represent like misrepresentation

23:38.080 --> 23:46.320
of that phenomenon. It's to support students in finding the unique or queer aspects of themselves.

23:46.320 --> 23:52.240
That's what it's really about. Drag queen story hour is not about empathy. That's their marketing

23:52.240 --> 23:58.400
strategy and it is in fact to their eyes a bit problematic. So they know that they're lying

23:58.400 --> 24:04.560
about it in a way that actually goes against their values in order to get it into the schools and

24:04.560 --> 24:08.720
libraries and in front of children in general. But what it's really about is getting kids to

24:08.720 --> 24:15.280
discover any aspects of themselves that they might feel uncomfortable about or marginalized because of

24:15.280 --> 24:20.720
or different because of that might be able to be considered queer by a queer theorist or queer

24:20.800 --> 24:27.360
educator so that those aspects can be nurtured in the sense of making them have more and more and

24:27.360 --> 24:34.720
more discomfort about themselves and then until an initiatory rupture occurs so that they can

24:34.720 --> 24:43.200
develop the children into a queer political stance that will then be conflated with being who they

24:43.200 --> 24:47.600
really are. That's what's going on with queer theory. That's what Halpern is actually describing.

24:47.600 --> 24:52.320
By calling them queer identities what you're doing is saying here's this political activity

24:52.320 --> 24:56.720
and you're going to pretend that that political activity is who you are. By the way that political

24:56.720 --> 25:02.560
activity is hating the world as it is and hating people for being normal and hating

25:03.760 --> 25:09.920
anything that is is based in the idea of legitimacy. So oppositional defiant disorder

25:10.880 --> 25:18.000
as a political stance that you're now going to consider to be who you are which is in fact

25:18.000 --> 25:24.880
in the definition of queer not what it's about. So what will happen is they take these kids they

25:24.880 --> 25:31.120
introduce them to queer potentialities by sticking a drag queen in front of them and then they make

25:31.120 --> 25:36.240
them feel uncomfortable about themselves and they exploit that uncomfortable or emotional crisis or

25:36.240 --> 25:41.200
whatever it is to make them feel isolated and alone and then they say there's a new way to

25:41.200 --> 25:46.640
understand yourself and there's a new way to understand who you are and the world and why it

25:46.640 --> 25:53.200
doesn't like you. So then they can awaken to some basic ideas of queer theory and more than that

25:53.200 --> 25:59.920
they'll be told that they're not truly allowed to be who they really are. Society will object.

26:00.560 --> 26:04.880
Their parents will object. In particular they'll focus on the objection to the parents because

26:04.880 --> 26:10.000
they have to get the kids away from their parents whose parental duty and responsibility it is to

26:10.000 --> 26:17.600
protect them from this kind of ideological and maybe worse grooming. In fact it's so likely that

26:17.600 --> 26:24.320
their parents will reject this this discovery of who they really are as queer that it may have to be

26:24.320 --> 26:30.560
kept secret from their parents in case it wouldn't be affirmed by them and don't worry the state

26:31.200 --> 26:36.320
depending on what state you're in and now more than a dozen states will force your parents to

26:36.320 --> 26:41.280
affirm this or threaten to take your children away or maybe take them away for real. I'm not supposed

26:41.280 --> 26:46.640
to use I know the word grooming to describe this grotesque set of activities that's a part of a

26:46.640 --> 26:51.920
major controversy. In fact it's part of it's one of the main reasons that these kids came dressed

26:51.920 --> 26:57.760
as clowns to protest me at Pitt when I gave this talk but I'm not supposed to call these people

26:57.760 --> 27:02.960
groomers because it makes the left mad that we call them what they are so I'm going to ask a

27:02.960 --> 27:08.160
question instead. Instead of saying this is obviously groomer behavior and I know I already

27:08.160 --> 27:13.120
did let's back up let's slow down let's be a little more careful Jim. I'm going to show you

27:13.120 --> 27:18.080
something else from this paper and I'm going to ask this question what word am I supposed to use

27:18.080 --> 27:24.640
for it. We've already talked about this idea of from empathy to embodied kinship but I'm going

27:24.640 --> 27:30.480
to read something else from this paper and I want to know what word I am supposed to use for it.

27:30.480 --> 27:36.480
Drag Queen Story Hour presents itself as family friendly in a way that characterizes itself as

27:36.480 --> 27:42.480
a preparatory introduction to alternate modes of kinship. That's what it says. What does that mean?

27:43.840 --> 27:48.880
What does that mean? Preparatory introduction to alternate modes of kinship. In fact it says the

27:48.880 --> 27:54.560
family and family friendly refers to a queer code for the other queers they connect with on

27:54.560 --> 28:01.600
the street rather than the family that's like the real family. So the Drag Queen Story Hour people

28:01.600 --> 28:07.600
are not just lying about the idea that they use empathy but they're also lying about what they

28:07.600 --> 28:13.360
mean by family when they sell it as family friendly. They tell us themselves in black and white that

28:13.360 --> 28:18.880
they mean it is a queer code for a new family, a queer family, a drag family that Drag Queen Story

28:18.880 --> 28:24.240
Hour is teaching kids to become friendly to. That's what they mean by family friendly but they want

28:24.240 --> 28:29.200
you to think it means that yeah adults and parents and little kids and their grandparents are all

28:29.200 --> 28:34.320
welcome to come watch. The paper in fact repeatedly invokes the concept of a drag family for the kids

28:34.320 --> 28:40.480
that they would you know obviously latch on to in order to develop their queer aspects of themselves

28:40.480 --> 28:44.800
and then the last sentence of the paper the last half of that sentence anyway is

28:44.800 --> 28:49.280
we'll leave a trail of glitter that will never come out of the carpet. Well what's the carpet

28:49.280 --> 28:55.360
here seems like it's probably children's minds doesn't seem like that's on the up and up now

28:55.360 --> 28:59.200
remember that I'm going to read the actual full quote I've just talked about it. Let me read the

28:59.200 --> 29:03.280
real quote to you the real paragraph and the question is what word am I supposed to use for

29:03.280 --> 29:07.920
this because I'm not supposed to call it grooming okay so here's a full the full quote of that family

29:07.920 --> 29:12.960
friendly part so you don't think I'm lying even though I did a podcast about it before queer

29:12.960 --> 29:18.320
world making including political organizing has long been a project driven by desire that's what I

29:18.320 --> 29:24.960
said earlier it isn't part enacted through art sorry it enacted through art forms like fashion

29:24.960 --> 29:30.800
theater and drag so queer world making is enacted through art forms like fashion theater and drag

29:30.800 --> 29:36.320
notice it's not math or physics or history we believe that drag queen story hour offers an

29:36.320 --> 29:42.480
invitation toward deeper public engagement with queer cultural production particularly for young

29:42.480 --> 29:47.360
children and their families this one of those times where I want to have like digital slowdown

29:47.360 --> 29:56.720
particularly for young children and their families particularly for young children

29:56.720 --> 30:03.120
do you get the point particularly for young children it may be that drag queen story hour is

30:03.120 --> 30:08.000
quote family friendly in the sense that it is accessible and inviting to families with children

30:08.000 --> 30:15.280
that's what we call the mod but it is less a sanitizing force than it is a preparatory introduction

30:15.280 --> 30:23.840
to alternate modes of kinship period that's the bailey here drag queen story hour is quote family

30:23.840 --> 30:30.720
friendly in the sense of quote family as an old school queer code to identify and connect with

30:30.720 --> 30:40.720
other queers on the street so I'm asking I can't use the word groomer what word am I supposed to

30:40.720 --> 30:50.160
use for that I know which word I can't use and that puts me at a complete loss but what I have

30:50.160 --> 30:57.680
actually described to you isn't just drag queen story hour it is queer pedagogy it is queer education

30:57.680 --> 31:04.400
it is the installing of queer theory into children by means of the educational system and

31:04.400 --> 31:10.400
educational methodologies both in terms of curriculum and in terms of teaching methods

31:11.920 --> 31:18.960
so here's how queer theory works you can't describe it you can't say anything about it

31:19.520 --> 31:26.480
unless you support it because otherwise you were applying power to it you were being unjust you were

31:26.480 --> 31:35.200
doing anti-lgbtq hate you didn't engage properly because if you engaged properly that means that you

31:35.200 --> 31:41.680
took on the worldview and agreed with it you can't even talk about queer theory according to queer

31:41.680 --> 31:48.400
theorists unless you support it it is just like a cult one that targets kids as we can clearly see

31:48.400 --> 31:54.400
one that is based in sex and one that doesn't have a lot to do with gay people remember if you

31:54.400 --> 32:00.240
criticize queer theory that's anti-lgbtq hate you will end up with a profile if you're

32:00.960 --> 32:05.840
high enough profile individual such as myself on the southern poverty law center accusing you of

32:05.840 --> 32:12.720
anti-lgbtq hate of hate speech of malice of all these things you'll get accused of homophobia

32:12.720 --> 32:19.120
transphobia and the famous term is anti-lgbtq hate I'm going to keep coming back to that because

32:19.120 --> 32:24.320
there's so many things out there claiming that people such as me and others engage in anti-lgbtq

32:25.120 --> 32:35.440
hate all you have to do to engage in anti-lgbtq hate is read queer theory out loud word for word

32:35.440 --> 32:41.920
as it is written by queer theorists themselves and say that's bad so there's a rumor widely

32:41.920 --> 32:47.280
printed about me that I because of my use of the word groomer to describe what we just talked about

32:47.280 --> 32:52.080
implicates me in some social crime called anti-lgbtq hate which is apparently very bad very serious

32:52.080 --> 32:57.840
and early toxic even though all it means is not agreeing with queer theory it's not just harmful

32:57.840 --> 33:03.600
rhetoric it's in fact also a conspiracy theory they say and I am not just a very bad person

33:03.600 --> 33:10.720
which obviously I must be but also a very crazy person for naming the obvious not as a result of

33:10.720 --> 33:16.720
inference not as a result of guesswork not as a result of any emotions that I have but literally

33:16.800 --> 33:24.480
just by reading out loud and saying exactly what their own proudly printed writings say

33:26.000 --> 33:31.840
without any need to embellish without any need to interpret I just tell you what it says and say

33:32.400 --> 33:38.480
by the way they mean it when they say the empathy is a marketing trope and family friendly is a

33:38.480 --> 33:44.560
marketing trope but they really mean something else that there is a Mott and Bailey rhetorical

33:44.560 --> 33:52.400
strategy in play here I'm not in Bailey actual dialectical lie here all I'm doing you is telling

33:52.400 --> 34:00.880
you what they've written making taking some of the veneer off of it and now I am a conspiracy

34:00.880 --> 34:08.160
theorist I am a hater I have a southern poverty law center article and a profile written up about

34:08.160 --> 34:11.360
me do you think well who cares that's like a badge of honor and I take it that way obviously

34:11.360 --> 34:15.840
that's why I called myself general hate but stop for two seconds and realize

34:16.720 --> 34:21.200
that if I get called to do some professional thing that's going to get brought up as a reason

34:21.200 --> 34:25.920
why I'm not supposed to be there if I try to give a talk and protesters try to get a shutdown

34:25.920 --> 34:31.440
they're going to leverage that against some wavering or even complicit institutional

34:31.440 --> 34:38.160
administration to keep me out they know how this works the accusation and the resulting

34:38.160 --> 34:43.600
social dynamic which is always hostile is straight out of Maoism it's straight out of Maoist China

34:43.600 --> 34:50.400
from the 1950s and 60s I have been alleged to be engaging in a crime called anti LGBTQ hate

34:51.120 --> 34:56.720
and the right side of history and right side of society which are on the right side of history

34:56.720 --> 35:03.680
are called to judge me bully me hold me to account for that crime by whatever means it can manage

35:03.680 --> 35:08.960
the bullying is to continue until I learn to recognize my crime from the queer position

35:10.240 --> 35:16.320
in other words I adopted the positionality of queer theory and see how what I said or what I did

35:16.320 --> 35:22.160
was actually socially criminal and I pledged to reform my thought by adopting queer theory

35:22.160 --> 35:26.720
so that I can not only do better but also become an activist on behalf of queer theory it's a life

35:26.720 --> 35:35.280
long commitment to self reflection self critique and social activism this is identical to the

35:35.280 --> 35:41.680
thought reform programs of Mao's China it's just a slightly different ideology of course their

35:41.680 --> 35:46.320
accusation is absolute nonsense but that's not the point the point is to initiate the social

35:46.320 --> 35:51.360
struggle session on me in order to transform my views to ones that are either at least empathetic

35:51.360 --> 35:58.960
to or ideally that embrace and repeat queer theory the accusation is of an old Marxist standard

35:58.960 --> 36:04.240
form truth married to a lie and here's the truth gays and lesbians fought for decades to break the

36:04.240 --> 36:09.360
public perception that they are predators and groomers of children but here's the lie that's

36:09.360 --> 36:14.320
who and what I'm talking about when I criticize their theory and activism in other words I'm not

36:14.320 --> 36:20.560
talking about gay people just like Halpern's not talking about gay people unlike gay identity

36:20.560 --> 36:25.520
I'm talking about people who are deliberately engaging in the ideological and maybe worse

36:26.720 --> 36:31.840
transformation of children into a queer political identity that's who I'm talking about

36:31.840 --> 36:36.800
but the the the lie is that I'm talking about gays and lesbians or maybe trans people at large

36:37.520 --> 36:42.560
when I criticize their own theory and activism and point out that what they say in their own words

36:43.760 --> 36:49.680
needs a word it sounds seems very groomery even if I can't say groomer about it and we're all not

36:49.680 --> 36:54.000
supposed to of course we can say that and we do say that and it's not hate to point it out it's

36:54.000 --> 37:02.320
right there in black and white but this has nothing to do with any of that the truth is that queer

37:02.320 --> 37:06.880
used to be a slur for gay people so the activists took it on to describe themselves in defiance

37:07.520 --> 37:12.480
of prejudice and bigotry but also because it now becomes impossible to talk about it oh queer

37:12.480 --> 37:18.480
theory you're using a slur there's there's a there's a situation the lie is that queer theory

37:18.480 --> 37:23.280
ever represented civil rights movements for anyone or gay people in particular in fact it was the

37:23.280 --> 37:28.640
opposite it was against everything that the gay civil rights movement was about queer theory is a

37:28.640 --> 37:33.600
destructive form of radical activism because it's a marxist theory so there has to be activism

37:33.600 --> 37:38.800
connected it's not just a theory it's theory and practice combined and it is a destructive form of

37:38.800 --> 37:43.920
radical activism that actually historically opposed gay civil rights inequality well why in the world

37:43.920 --> 37:49.520
would it do that aren't they the same thing no of course not because gay equality and gay acceptance

37:49.520 --> 37:56.640
would normalize being gay within society and would legitimize normalcy and legitimacy right

37:56.640 --> 38:02.560
legitimize gay people as fully equal members of society queer theory is by definition radically

38:02.560 --> 38:07.760
opposed on principle to anything normal and legitimate they even have a word for what would

38:07.760 --> 38:14.720
happen if we had gay equality and gay acceptance homonormativity which is society accepting

38:14.720 --> 38:20.320
gay as being part of the normal expression of what it means to be human sometimes and that would

38:20.320 --> 38:25.360
mean it's within the normative framework now and the gay people are expected to okay you're great

38:25.360 --> 38:30.720
you're gay so what great get a put on a suit and get a job and that would all be very bad because

38:30.720 --> 38:35.840
they're no longer radical activists gay activists who are listening to this from the 1990s can readily

38:35.840 --> 38:40.400
back me up on this they'll readily attest that the queer activists were often strongly opposed to

38:40.400 --> 38:47.040
their ambitions for civil and legal equality for marriage and for social acceptance they just were

38:47.040 --> 38:52.480
why because they wanted radicals queer theory needs radical activists not stable citizens who can go

38:52.480 --> 38:57.840
about their lives in a society that doesn't in any way meaningfully discriminate against them

38:57.840 --> 39:02.320
they need there to be discrimination or the appearance of hate or the the fear that there

39:02.320 --> 39:08.800
will be the bad old times coming back in order to radicalize those people into revolutionary activity

39:09.760 --> 39:13.120
or just to show up and be human shields for the queer theorists who are doing that

39:15.360 --> 39:18.800
the civil rights activists and the gay civil rights movements in the

39:19.520 --> 39:26.880
80s 90s and so on fought hard for decades to over starting at least in the 50s to overcome

39:26.880 --> 39:30.800
stereotypes of predatory behavior and the idea that they're intrinsically groomers

39:30.800 --> 39:36.720
and that's why the queer theorists actually claim that or that's why they're actually able to claim

39:36.720 --> 39:44.000
that calling out their blatant grooming is anti lgbt lgbtq they're saying look

39:45.200 --> 39:50.880
50 60 years ago 30 years ago people said that all gay gay people are groomers and gay rights just

39:50.880 --> 39:56.560
enables groomers and the gays the gay civil rights leaders fought back and said no that is not what

39:56.560 --> 40:03.120
we're about that is nothing to do with who we are that is a harmful stereotype and they won we

40:03.120 --> 40:08.400
trusted them and now you have these freaks and weirdos who are queer theorists who were never

40:08.400 --> 40:14.880
particularly interested in civil rights at all who are saying if you call them which is the

40:14.880 --> 40:22.320
narrower narrower subset the q not even all the rest of it if you call the q groomers then what

40:22.320 --> 40:28.800
you are doing is anti lgbtq hate you see how the acronym works to create human shields

40:30.160 --> 40:40.560
do you understand that l lesbian g gay b bisexual t trans q queer all different all different

40:40.560 --> 40:44.560
lesbians are women who are attracted to women by the way you have to know what a woman is to make

40:44.560 --> 40:49.280
that work gays are men who are attracted to men you have to know what men are to make that work

40:49.280 --> 40:54.640
bisexuals are people who are attracted to men and women by two so you have to believe in the

40:54.640 --> 41:02.640
binary to make that work trans people it's its own complicated topic but they are men or women

41:02.640 --> 41:08.400
who do not recognize themselves as men or women and in fact may actually recognize themselves

41:08.400 --> 41:15.520
as the opposite so something's very different there and then q is queer and we already heard

41:15.520 --> 41:18.720
that queer has nothing to do with any of that because queer is a radical political stance

41:19.760 --> 41:27.200
but if you criticize queer you get wrapped up in anti lgbtq hate when you're not engaging in

41:28.080 --> 41:38.160
any anti lgb or maybe even sometimes t activity thought or anything at all it's super fake it's

41:38.160 --> 41:46.880
a standard trick that these kind of gnostic cults do another example is the christian nationalist

41:46.880 --> 41:52.720
movement does the exact same trick for example if you criticize christian nationalism and you happen

41:52.720 --> 41:58.160
not to be a christian ask me how i know what they will say is james is attacking christians no i'm

41:58.160 --> 42:03.840
not i'm attacking lunatics who are hiding behind the christian identity and brand same thing with

42:03.840 --> 42:10.320
feminists if you do maybe ask me how i know again maybe you call radical feminists hags i don't know

42:10.320 --> 42:13.360
why you would do that you'd say they're a bunch of man hating hags maybe you would say that about

42:13.360 --> 42:17.840
radical feminists for some reason or another maybe nobody could know why you would say that but maybe

42:17.840 --> 42:22.880
you say that maybe you're tempted to say that and you say that and they'll say you're attacking women

42:23.520 --> 42:28.960
no you're not attacking women you're talk you're attacking radical feminist hags it's very clear

42:28.960 --> 42:32.640
who you're actually talking about and they don't get to represent all women it's very much like

42:32.640 --> 42:37.200
when donald trump is one of my favorite donald trump incidents was in an interview with one of

42:37.200 --> 42:41.040
these hags probably katie kerrick or something like that i don't remember the details what he was

42:41.040 --> 42:44.640
in this interview and they said well what about when you called women hags and luckily he knew what

42:44.640 --> 42:49.840
the hell they were no pigs what about when you called women pigs and uh donald trump luckily

42:49.840 --> 42:53.760
knew what the hell they were talking about he said i didn't call women pigs i called rosy o donal a pig

42:54.320 --> 43:00.000
which is hilarious because that's actually what's happening and of course i'm i'm way off script here

43:00.000 --> 43:06.720
but this is generally what they do they blend contexts that are not the same together and treat

43:06.720 --> 43:12.000
them as though they're the same radical feminists might be women but they are not representative

43:12.000 --> 43:16.320
of all women no matter how much they think that they get to be the gnostic representatives

43:16.320 --> 43:22.000
of true womanhood they don't get to do that so if you criticize the specific group say radical

43:22.000 --> 43:29.600
feminists or christian nationalists or queer theorists or whatever they hide behind the general

43:29.600 --> 43:35.840
group by claiming to be the true representatives of that thing they're blending together the context

43:35.840 --> 43:42.080
of the specific their group with the general or the whole which they actually are a part of

43:42.080 --> 43:50.880
yes it's true when i criticize um radical feminists who happen to be women that i am

43:50.880 --> 43:56.880
criticizing some women but i'm not criticizing women as i don't even like to think of women

43:56.880 --> 44:03.680
as a class i'm criticizing particular women just like rosy o donal when i criticize

44:05.760 --> 44:12.000
queer theorists i'm not criticizing lgbtq because lgbtq doesn't even exist that's that's a

44:12.960 --> 44:18.080
manufactured synthetic coalition so that queer theorists can hide behind other people who are

44:18.080 --> 44:22.240
sympathetic characters when i criticize christian nationalists it doesn't really matter they call

44:22.240 --> 44:30.160
themselves christian but they're obviously not so whatever what's happening is that the fact is

44:30.160 --> 44:36.000
that queer activism explicitly as we've described it so far puts the appearance of glaring truth back

44:36.000 --> 44:41.680
into the stereotypes of groomers and then when you call them out for it they get mad and hide behind

44:41.680 --> 44:49.600
gay people and say see they're attacking you all you gay people see the conservatives everybody

44:49.600 --> 44:55.120
the society hates gay people and everyday gay people who are good citizens lose the most from

44:55.120 --> 45:00.000
this little trick because eventually things start to break down and the queer activists gain the

45:00.000 --> 45:04.480
most because they end up with a larger pool of radicalism they end up with more contention and

45:04.480 --> 45:10.960
division in society and they end up with more instability in society queer activism is therefore

45:10.960 --> 45:20.080
a strictly parasitic behavior like any cult activity but about grooming more specifically i

45:20.080 --> 45:25.680
am talking not even necessarily about the thing that they are accusing me of i'm not when i say

45:25.680 --> 45:31.440
that ant that this is grooming i'm not actually talking about the sexual grooming that they try

45:31.440 --> 45:36.960
to pretend this is them again blending context i am grooming talking about grooming specifically

45:36.960 --> 45:41.840
into a cult ideology called queer theory i've been very clear about this over and over again you

45:41.840 --> 45:46.480
can look the word up type in the word grooming and see what it means yes there is the idea of sexual

45:46.480 --> 45:52.000
grooming and oh there it is ideological or political or whatever other professional grooming

45:53.360 --> 45:58.720
but just to really drive home that they are doing ideological grooming like it's not already clear

45:58.720 --> 46:04.480
let's direct our attention to another scholar another queer educator kevin commissaro who wrote

46:04.480 --> 46:10.480
a paper in 2002 called against repetition and i remind you against repetition means against the

46:10.480 --> 46:16.800
repetition of the existing society by teaching kids to be queer activists anyway in that paper he

46:16.800 --> 46:23.040
describes the purpose of queer education for children and commissaro explicitly says that

46:23.040 --> 46:29.920
teaching children about social justice including about ideas from queer theory is meant to induce in

46:29.920 --> 46:36.720
fact it is the obligation of the teacher to do this to induce an emotional and identity based

46:36.720 --> 46:43.680
crisis in them he then says that's why it's so important to have queer educators in place

46:43.680 --> 46:49.040
who can guide the the now vulnerable students who are experiencing emotional crisis so that

46:49.040 --> 46:54.960
those crises are resolved in favor of social justice and queer theory here are some relevant

46:54.960 --> 47:00.320
quotes from the paper from pages 74 and 75 he says repeating what is already learned can be

47:00.320 --> 47:04.480
comforting and therefore desirable students learning things that question their knowledge

47:05.040 --> 47:11.600
and identities on the other hand can be emotionally upsetting for example suppose students think

47:11.600 --> 47:17.680
society is meritocratic but learn that it is racist raise your hand if you're sick of this

47:17.680 --> 47:23.680
shit or think that they themselves are not contributing to homophobia but learn that they

47:23.680 --> 47:30.720
in fact are raise your hand if you're sick of this shit in such situations students learn that the

47:30.720 --> 47:37.280
ways that they think and act are not only limited but also oppressive learning about oppression

47:37.280 --> 47:42.880
and about the ways they often unknowingly comply with oppression can lead students to feel

47:44.080 --> 47:50.320
paralyzed with anger sadness anxiety and guilt it can lead to a form of emotional crisis

47:51.040 --> 47:56.320
they think this is an educational mandate this is what the point of education is and then he says

47:56.320 --> 48:01.760
once in a crisis students can go in many directions some that may lead to anti oppressive change

48:01.760 --> 48:08.160
others that may lead to a more entrenched resistance therefore educators have a responsibility not

48:08.160 --> 48:13.280
only to draw students into a possible crisis but also to structure experiences that can help

48:13.280 --> 48:19.840
them work through their crises productively let's just pause for a second educators have a

48:19.840 --> 48:27.520
responsibility to draw students into possible crisis that's a real sentence and then they also

48:27.520 --> 48:31.520
are meant to structure the environment and experiences around the student to get them

48:31.520 --> 48:38.560
to go in a particular direction that's cult indoctrination it's knowingly willfully and

48:38.560 --> 48:44.480
deliberately cult indoctrination but other scholars in the same domains confirm this for us

48:44.560 --> 48:50.880
there's another paper in 2019 two scholars torres and fairy they say it explicitly

48:52.480 --> 48:57.520
in a paper called not everyone gets a seat at the table they say it explicitly that this is

48:57.520 --> 49:02.320
what their model of education represents that it's in and i mean it that it's indoctrination

49:02.320 --> 49:07.520
here's how they said it for all the criticism teachers receive for quote indoctrinating

49:07.520 --> 49:12.480
students turning them into liberal minded cry babies not much has been said in defense

49:12.480 --> 49:18.880
at the very least a shy denial is made it is time for educators to own this criticism and admit

49:18.880 --> 49:24.560
that is exactly what we do there it is in black and white on page 33 of not everyone gets a seat

49:24.560 --> 49:29.760
at the table you can read these quotes in the querying of the american child where logan lansing

49:30.560 --> 49:36.880
put them he found these these quotes actually i did not but what kevin kumashiro is describing

49:36.880 --> 49:41.440
is actually worse than the indoctrination that torres and fairy are talking about saying that

49:41.440 --> 49:47.920
that's exactly what they do a cycle of inducing crisis and then resolving it toward a particular

49:47.920 --> 49:54.240
doctrine isn't indoctrination it's trauma bonding that's a practice of ideological

49:54.240 --> 50:02.720
transformation or thought reform or brainwashing or cult grooming so it can be pretty plainly said

50:02.720 --> 50:07.120
queer theory practices thought reform and it practices thought reform because queer theory

50:07.120 --> 50:11.840
is the doctrine of a religious cult we already see that that cult is based on sex and that it

50:11.840 --> 50:16.000
primarily targets children and that it has little or nothing to do with with being gay

50:16.000 --> 50:23.520
so that pretty much lays out my primary thesis that's what queer theory is now of course fine it's

50:23.520 --> 50:29.840
a cult what now well nobody joins a cult to join a cult so do you want to have in mind that the

50:29.840 --> 50:34.320
people in it don't know it's a cult and in fact they may not even know that they are subscribed

50:34.400 --> 50:38.000
to queer theory or that queer theory is a critical constructivist ideology of sex

50:38.000 --> 50:42.400
gender and sexuality they probably don't know those things as a matter of fact

50:43.360 --> 50:47.680
but people don't the point is people don't join a cult to go find a cult and join it nobody says

50:47.680 --> 50:50.880
in the morning hey i'm going to get up and go find a cult and join a cult because i don't have

50:50.880 --> 50:56.640
anything better to do people join a cult because they are suffering in some way and the cult comes

50:56.640 --> 51:03.120
in parasitically and offers them some false resolution to their suffering it seems like

51:03.120 --> 51:08.080
something that will get them out of loneliness out of spiritual malaise out of vulnerability of

51:08.080 --> 51:14.080
some kind virtually everyone who has ever escaped a cult tells this same story they wanted to belong

51:14.080 --> 51:18.160
they wanted a social circle they wanted to understanding they wanted purpose in life they

51:18.160 --> 51:25.920
wanted something to do the cult preys upon these people and slowly locks them in one of the tools

51:25.920 --> 51:32.080
they use is trauma bonding one of the tools they use is separating people from their their family

51:32.080 --> 51:38.880
and friends what's trauma bonding though that sounds bad besides what Kevin Kumashuro says

51:38.880 --> 51:43.440
is the point of queer education or education for social justice trauma bonding is as harmful

51:43.440 --> 51:50.000
and manipulative as it sounds it is the technique of cult initiation i should say and abuse it's

51:50.000 --> 51:56.080
basically like hazing the basic formula is really simple first you traumatize your targets until you've

51:56.080 --> 52:00.560
harmed them enough for the process to work and then you celebrate them when you do it when they

52:00.560 --> 52:05.280
do what you want and you don't celebrate them or even punish them more when they do what you don't

52:05.280 --> 52:11.280
want that's it they will bond with the people traumatizing them because of the rewards they

52:11.280 --> 52:17.840
get when the trauma is the traumatic experience is is lightened up this is what robert lifton in

52:17.840 --> 52:23.440
thought reform in the psychology of totalism refers to as an alternating cycle of harshness

52:23.440 --> 52:30.080
and leniency and that's key to how cult bonding works or thought reform works as a matter of fact

52:30.080 --> 52:35.280
which is basically the same thing so in queer theory what you do is you take people particularly

52:35.280 --> 52:40.320
kids and you tell them the world isn't at all the way that it seems and in fact neither are they

52:40.320 --> 52:44.320
and it isn't the way that they've been led to believe if they're different it's because they're

52:44.320 --> 52:49.440
oppressed if they feel uncomfortable it's because society doesn't like people like them they're

52:49.440 --> 52:53.200
probably different than they've always been told maybe they've been lied to about themselves

52:53.200 --> 52:58.160
they've certainly been lied to about other people and how society should be and it's been

52:58.160 --> 53:03.600
holding them back and making them feel bad and maybe instead it's well maybe you're not in that

53:03.600 --> 53:08.320
category but the way you act hurts other people you're hurting people that's what kevin kumashiro

53:08.320 --> 53:13.600
actually said now if you're interested in exploring further even though you're young you should you

53:13.600 --> 53:19.040
should explore these feelings these guilt anxiety anger sadness weren't those the ones he talked about

53:19.040 --> 53:23.840
discomfort with your body discomfort with your sexuality discomfort with your social environment

53:23.840 --> 53:27.840
discomfort with your parents if you're uncomfortable with any of this for any reason

53:28.400 --> 53:34.320
maybe your body is wrong maybe your family is wrong maybe there's somebody else who you who

53:34.320 --> 53:39.120
is who you really are that you don't know about in society just doesn't want you to be who they

53:39.120 --> 53:43.120
that person is your parents don't want you to be that person either and if they're parent if your

53:43.120 --> 53:48.480
parents disagree maybe they're going to disagree maybe they shouldn't be included in these decisions

53:48.480 --> 53:54.560
maybe you need to trust a trusted adult instead maybe you need a school counselor maybe you need

53:54.560 --> 53:58.720
the faculty member in charge of the gay straight alliance maybe you need a teacher who has the

53:58.720 --> 54:04.080
flag up that represents that they're a safe space and that they won't tell on you maybe you need

54:04.080 --> 54:11.440
a queer family queer theory is then offered as the lens that resolves all the resulting confusion

54:11.440 --> 54:19.920
shock dissonance pain guilt anxiety sadness anger and vulnerability that's how this works

54:19.920 --> 54:23.920
and then what happens next is that you affirm and celebrate them when they show interest

54:23.920 --> 54:28.880
if they get interested in this think oh yeah maybe that's right maybe I am different maybe

54:28.880 --> 54:34.080
there maybe society's not free maybe my parents wouldn't like me thinking this or doing this maybe

54:34.080 --> 54:39.520
I was made wrong maybe I'm in the wrong body maybe I'm in the wrong family then you celebrate them

54:39.520 --> 54:44.800
you lead them to believe that they're making brave decisions that are worthy of interest

54:44.800 --> 54:50.640
and respect you coerce them and their social groups to participate in this ritual of affirmation

54:51.280 --> 54:55.760
and tacitly threaten anyone who doesn't want to go along with it or maybe not even tacitly maybe

54:55.760 --> 54:58.880
you talk about how not inclusive they are and how they're part of the problem and how they're

54:58.880 --> 55:06.000
hurting people's feelings you make the people who are taking the path feel like they belong

55:06.000 --> 55:10.080
and that they just for being who they are are special and have a special purpose in the world

55:10.080 --> 55:15.040
to fulfill to change the world to transform the world to make it more accepting of people like

55:15.040 --> 55:20.480
them who don't get to feel that way or others that they know their friends you teach them special

55:20.480 --> 55:25.600
words that describe the very small but growing number of people who identify just like they do

55:25.600 --> 55:30.880
outside of the norm outside of what society and their parents consider legitimate this is the

55:30.880 --> 55:36.160
trauma bonding process of queer theory in particular in schools this is also called programming

55:36.160 --> 55:41.680
or grooming and it takes predictable paths the first thing it does is it leads people

55:41.680 --> 55:46.080
into emotional vulnerability that's what Kevin Kumashiro said what I just described by the way

55:46.080 --> 55:50.160
was it lead them into emotional crisis and then structure their experiences so they resolve those

55:50.160 --> 55:54.640
crises in the direction you want them to go in that's all I described but it leads people into

55:55.120 --> 56:03.600
this emotional vulnerability and into a kind of a path is offered to resolution and that generates

56:03.600 --> 56:08.320
personal and social interest which is followed up by psychological and social commitment they don't

56:08.320 --> 56:13.440
want to let the people down that they've so far impressed they want to keep feeling brave and

56:14.000 --> 56:19.040
unique and different and special so they get a psychological commitment but also a social

56:19.040 --> 56:22.000
commitment these people have invested in them these people care about them these people are

56:22.000 --> 56:25.840
supporting them and affirming them in their journeys and you're going to let them down if

56:25.840 --> 56:31.040
you just bail out and think maybe it's not for you this is then deepened into an increasingly deep

56:31.040 --> 56:38.320
social and emotional commitment to the cult that's achieved largely through repeated cycles of

56:38.320 --> 56:44.960
trauma bonding techniques that's how they do this that's what it means to lead people into crisis

56:44.960 --> 56:51.440
and structure their environment so that the crisis resolves in the desired direction this process

56:51.440 --> 56:58.000
creates emotionally and socially bonded members who populate the wide majority of any cult membership

56:58.800 --> 57:03.360
those who are socially and emotionally locked in without necessarily understanding the doctrine

57:03.360 --> 57:06.800
they don't have to know a word of queer theory they don't have to know queer theory exists they

57:06.800 --> 57:13.760
don't have to know anything all they have to do is feel like they belong in the cult and feel like

57:13.760 --> 57:20.640
they don't belong in the world anymore they don't need anything more than that I've called this in

57:20.640 --> 57:26.000
the past talking about the structure of cults the outer school of the cult the social psychological

57:26.000 --> 57:32.640
and emotional cues are then steadily deepened over time through processes of increasing exposure

57:32.640 --> 57:38.880
to doctrine by processes of increasing exposure to trauma bonding by having them facilitate the

57:38.880 --> 57:44.960
same process on someone else who's newer in the path so that they get more and more committed to it

57:44.960 --> 57:56.080
the feelings the themes increasingly focus on guilt shame isolation alienation confusion

57:58.400 --> 58:03.760
at least on the one hand but meanwhile they're also talking about a horizon of potentiality

58:03.760 --> 58:11.760
in other words hope excitement inclusion belonging on the other shunning people who act like haters

58:11.760 --> 58:17.200
that's why it's called anti lgbtq hate to disagree with them shunning haters who don't support and

58:17.200 --> 58:23.760
affirm them even if it's their own families is also increased over time to make sure the cult

58:23.760 --> 58:30.160
environment is the predominant influence in the victims lives that's what structuring the environment

58:30.160 --> 58:38.400
looks like as this process is repeated this is brainwashing it is thought reform it is not education

58:39.120 --> 58:46.720
when the in fact it's child abuse and it's happening at scale by demand in virtually every

58:46.720 --> 58:52.800
school system in the united states and in canada where it's actually worse what happens when these

58:52.800 --> 58:58.160
kids get committed enough to the cult when their emotional and social connection is so deep that

58:58.160 --> 59:03.760
they're that's who they are now that's who they know themselves to be in terms in terms of what's

59:03.840 --> 59:08.880
in terms of what's called psychosocial valuation well when the commitment is high enough a process

59:08.880 --> 59:14.720
of study begins that's when they're going to get introduced to the actual doctrine the more

59:14.720 --> 59:20.400
committed outer school members will start to learn the doctrine of the cult here they'd be

59:20.400 --> 59:26.480
studying queer theory in mal's prisons they would be studying Marxism and Leninism and socialism

59:27.360 --> 59:32.560
they're not just learning how to use pronouns or discover new ones they're not learning how to

59:32.560 --> 59:36.720
present themselves how to denounce everything against queer theory how to shut people out of

59:36.720 --> 59:41.280
their lives for disagreeing what the cult thinks is good for supporting people who are going through

59:41.280 --> 59:47.680
this process affirming blah blah blah cancels what's what's against them and affirm what is for them

59:47.680 --> 59:52.320
they're not just doing that they're also learning to defend that with pseudo-intellectual arguments

59:52.880 --> 59:58.960
based in queer theory they're learning to do a lot of queer activism which deepens their commitment

59:58.960 --> 01:00:04.000
every time you act on behalf of a set of beliefs you become more committed to those beliefs every

01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:11.120
time you act in a commitment to a group you become more committed to the group why would you be doing

01:00:11.120 --> 01:00:16.560
any of this stuff which is unpopular and difficult i might even involve scary stuff like surgeries

01:00:16.560 --> 01:00:21.520
or standing up to your parents or throwing at your parents under the bus when you could be doing

01:00:21.520 --> 01:00:27.200
other things better things easier things unless you are really committed that's the psychology

01:00:27.680 --> 01:00:32.560
here and these people who are socially and emotionally dependent on a cult that has groomed

01:00:32.560 --> 01:00:38.240
them to be that way are then led to become intellectually committed to it and they form

01:00:38.240 --> 01:00:43.680
not an outer school of the cult but an inner school they are what we might call adapts not initiates

01:00:45.680 --> 01:00:50.960
most of the scholars the community organizers and the queer theory cult are in this tier most of

01:00:50.960 --> 01:00:56.000
the teachers that visit this upon kids by the way are not they're caught up in the outer school

01:00:56.080 --> 01:01:00.000
themselves they don't know the doctrine they don't they may not even like it they're just stuck

01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:04.560
having to do it or going along with a current or they're just caught up by empathy which is we

01:01:04.560 --> 01:01:12.400
already heard a lie to push it on to people just in case the activists the consultants they definitely

01:01:12.400 --> 01:01:18.400
are the scholars they definitely are they know what they're doing there's another tier beyond this

01:01:18.400 --> 01:01:23.120
of course the so-called inner circle to cults members of the inner circle of a cult direct the

01:01:23.120 --> 01:01:28.960
cult and profit from the cult they might or might not believe in its doctrine depending on their

01:01:28.960 --> 01:01:33.600
motivations with queer theory undoubtedly some of the biggest organizers and financiers of the

01:01:33.600 --> 01:01:39.440
movement which primarily targets our children do not believe in it itself but fully believe in its

01:01:39.440 --> 01:01:46.720
destructive and disruptive potential on our society and our kids others do believe in the

01:01:46.720 --> 01:01:51.120
enormous amount of profit that's available from destroying lives and turning them into a permanent

01:01:51.120 --> 01:02:00.240
complicated medical or psychiatric patient others see political utility i don't think it's likely

01:02:00.240 --> 01:02:06.000
that much of the biden administration really believes queer theory but they see it as a political tool

01:02:07.120 --> 01:02:12.640
and they also see its capacity to build a permanently disaffected group with partially

01:02:12.640 --> 01:02:17.440
legitimate demands that will make for the rest of their lives against a system they hate that they

01:02:17.440 --> 01:02:23.520
can then pander to others see getting millions of people to participate in the cult and its affirmations

01:02:23.520 --> 01:02:28.640
is the way to affirm themselves and their own journeys think of the kind of big trans billionaires

01:02:28.640 --> 01:02:35.120
martin rothblatt the pritzkers and so on they shovel money into it so lots of kids will become

01:02:35.120 --> 01:02:41.040
trans so that society accepts trans so the society accepts them and that they were a trailblazer who

01:02:41.040 --> 01:02:48.080
made it happen that's their journey and it has to be affirmed so then they just happen to have

01:02:48.080 --> 01:02:52.400
billions of dollars to finance campaigns for mass affirmation there are lots of reasons why people

01:02:52.400 --> 01:02:57.680
at that tier of the cult might be involved and it's not always that they fully believe in it though

01:02:57.680 --> 01:03:03.600
it can sometimes be that the most important thing to remember about these different tiers of cults

01:03:03.600 --> 01:03:10.240
and the basic structure of cults and the guiding principles behind each is just that they exist

01:03:10.240 --> 01:03:14.240
that's the most important thing to realize the outer school are initiates they're seeking

01:03:15.040 --> 01:03:21.600
psychological and social reward through the cults manipulative offerings they're overwhelmingly the

01:03:21.600 --> 01:03:27.040
majority of the captured cultists the inner school seeks the same thing but more they have

01:03:27.040 --> 01:03:33.280
existential fervor tied to it in some degree that increases over time of intellectual immoral superiority

01:03:33.280 --> 01:03:38.480
because they know the doctrine the inner circle may or may not even know the doctrine they usually

01:03:38.480 --> 01:03:43.520
do but they don't always tends to be small in number and is ultimately using the whole cult

01:03:43.520 --> 01:03:47.520
to whatever its twisted purposes are which may not agree with one another in a case like this

01:03:48.080 --> 01:03:52.080
in the case of marxist cults the inner circle always uses the revolutionary cult of the era

01:03:52.080 --> 01:03:56.080
and then disposes of it when it's time to move on to the next phase of the revolution

01:03:56.080 --> 01:04:00.240
and i don't think that we should see anything different i think that these destabilizers

01:04:00.240 --> 01:04:06.000
that we see in queer activism are likely to be disposed of when they become a liability if the

01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:09.680
revolution succeeds but they're really useful for tearing apart the society we have now

01:04:10.480 --> 01:04:14.880
by tearing apart families and children's lives and so much else

01:04:16.480 --> 01:04:20.800
so a little more on the environment about cults though because i think it's important to understand

01:04:20.800 --> 01:04:25.760
the environment in which cults transform their victims needs to be kind of looked at

01:04:25.760 --> 01:04:29.680
and nobody's done it in greater depth than robert lyfton robert j lyfton who studied the

01:04:29.680 --> 01:04:37.440
Maoist cult in detail as it was happening in the 1950s and he asserts that cults effectively take

01:04:37.440 --> 01:04:43.360
advantage of up to eight qualities that allows them to do thought reform on their populations

01:04:44.160 --> 01:04:48.560
queer theory as you'll see very obviously utilizes all eight of these and does so in

01:04:48.560 --> 01:04:55.440
sophisticated ways and so i'll talk about each one of these eight very briefly first there's

01:04:55.520 --> 01:05:00.640
melu control cults control the environment and make sure it only reflects cult doctrine

01:05:00.640 --> 01:05:05.440
this is why they cut people off from their friends or families uh any outside information

01:05:05.440 --> 01:05:09.760
and views that's all problematic it's harmful it's hurtful it's hate you can't look at it don't

01:05:09.760 --> 01:05:15.520
listen to james lindsay's podcast he's a hater he's lgbtq hate it's just gonna hurt your feelings

01:05:15.520 --> 01:05:21.680
it's so much transphobia you won't be able to stand it they keep you isolated in your melu from

01:05:21.680 --> 01:05:27.440
anything that might challenge or or break you free of cult doctrine so by the way if you happen

01:05:27.440 --> 01:05:31.200
to be imbibed in queer theory or you're kind of a queer theorist or you think you have a queer

01:05:31.200 --> 01:05:35.680
identity and you happen to be listening to this you're in a fucking cult now i'm just let me tell

01:05:35.680 --> 01:05:40.320
you just bluntly i use the bad word not because i lack words not because i'm missing vocabulary

01:05:40.320 --> 01:05:45.600
but to get your attention you are in a fucking cult and you are gonna you need to wake up it will

01:05:45.600 --> 01:05:51.280
your life will get better from the day you start getting away from this but anyway the melu control

01:05:51.280 --> 01:05:56.720
is all about like in our our world what we see is that it's using inclusion policies to ensure

01:05:56.720 --> 01:06:02.560
institutions and people only present cult agreeable views and affirmation and they remove anything

01:06:02.560 --> 01:06:07.040
that might cause doubt to the cult including people materials and so on aka cancel culture

01:06:08.240 --> 01:06:12.640
it is the immersive media and messaging that we get from all levels entertainment school

01:06:13.680 --> 01:06:19.520
politicians everything once you have melu control second lyfton says that you can then engage in

01:06:19.520 --> 01:06:24.560
something he calls mystical manipulation and i did a short bullet point episode of the podcast

01:06:24.560 --> 01:06:32.560
recently about that called plan spontaneity the lie of plan spontaneity cults he says create an

01:06:32.560 --> 01:06:39.520
appearance of total agreement mostly by silencing all disagreement and a sense of inevitability

01:06:39.520 --> 01:06:42.960
you might hear it kind of phrase this way there's a change coming and there's nothing you can do

01:06:42.960 --> 01:06:46.560
about it but you want to get on the right side of it because things will be good for you you might

01:06:46.560 --> 01:06:51.680
also hear it is who's on the right side of history there's a sense of total agreement all of society

01:06:51.680 --> 01:06:57.200
is going this way in inevitability history is moving this way there's also planned spontaneity

01:06:57.760 --> 01:07:03.600
which is organized protests and activism and activities that are made to look like they were

01:07:03.600 --> 01:07:07.840
spontaneous and organic because that gives the impression that the people are motivated to

01:07:07.840 --> 01:07:12.320
bring this into being and it also gives a sense of higher purpose like being on the right side of

01:07:12.320 --> 01:07:18.480
history and the point of mystical manipulation by a cult is in order to convince the victims

01:07:19.120 --> 01:07:26.560
of their power and influence the inevitability the total agreement of society it's just happening

01:07:26.560 --> 01:07:33.600
look there's so many people involved and they're working toward a better future it makes the

01:07:33.600 --> 01:07:40.080
cult appear more right and righteous to those captured by its spells think of the film the

01:07:40.080 --> 01:07:44.480
Truman show Jim character and Jim Carrey's character Truman was at the center of a huge

01:07:44.480 --> 01:07:49.680
operation of mystical manipulation if you want to understand what that looks like that was a totally

01:07:49.680 --> 01:07:56.320
controlled milieu third Lyfton says that within cult environments there is a demand for purity

01:07:56.320 --> 01:08:00.720
actually he says within ideological totalist environments which is to say cult environments

01:08:00.720 --> 01:08:06.240
there's a demand for purity cults are virtually always puritanical in their value systems they

01:08:06.320 --> 01:08:11.600
present their victims with stark contrasts of good and evil of right and wrong on virtually every

01:08:11.600 --> 01:08:16.400
issue and they demand purity with being on the right side of every issue and in fact they leverage

01:08:16.400 --> 01:08:21.360
that because you can't be you can't be perfectly pure so you keep this constant wheel of shame

01:08:21.360 --> 01:08:26.000
turning inside of you of guilt and shame and then you use that to pressure other people into

01:08:26.000 --> 01:08:30.400
better compliance to cover up for your failures so that it's not you getting called out it's them

01:08:30.400 --> 01:08:37.200
instead first these dynamics manifest in dichotomies like pure versus impure absolutely good versus

01:08:37.200 --> 01:08:42.800
absolutely evil sacred versus profane or specifically in social justice cults like queer theory

01:08:42.800 --> 01:08:51.840
affirmation versus existential denial or care versus hate they're also interested at cults are if

01:08:51.840 --> 01:08:56.080
not obsessed with the binary of queer theory in particular with the binary of innocence versus

01:08:56.080 --> 01:09:02.960
initiation to various levels of standing within the cult including inclusion within the cult itself

01:09:02.960 --> 01:09:08.240
in the extreme this demand for purity sets up a dichotomy as stark as the people versus the enemies

01:09:08.240 --> 01:09:13.440
of the people the people support queer theory the enemies of the people are anti lgbtq hate who

01:09:13.440 --> 01:09:21.120
must be destroyed in the name of the queer people fourth he lists or he mentions what he calls a

01:09:21.120 --> 01:09:27.280
cult of confession that's based off of the demand for purity the demand for purity leads the cults

01:09:27.280 --> 01:09:33.360
victims to readily identify how they fall short of cult perfection leading them to both fear and

01:09:33.360 --> 01:09:40.240
desire to confess their failures and their evil ways that's the whole program confess recognize

01:09:40.240 --> 01:09:45.840
your crimes you have to confess look at the three body problem scene look at these other scenes of

01:09:45.840 --> 01:09:50.240
the cultural revolution that keep going viral now that people can kind of open their eyes and see

01:09:50.240 --> 01:09:56.320
what's happening that's what it's about a cult of confession confess how you are transphobic confess

01:09:56.320 --> 01:10:01.280
how you contribute to homophobia confess how you could do better cults often encourage this behavior

01:10:01.280 --> 01:10:06.000
to facilitate the trauma bonding process but they also do it to get you to recognize cult doctrine

01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:12.320
and its application to your own life and situation and what paul frady calls your own existential

01:10:12.320 --> 01:10:18.800
situation the trauma bonding wheel of pain it's turned through pressuring people to confess say

01:10:18.800 --> 01:10:24.000
to homophobia or transphobia being a made up gender a made up sexuality or whatever and then

01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:30.880
rewarding them what they do and punishing those that get accused of you know not being on board

01:10:31.600 --> 01:10:36.960
only later after they they say you know they after they do what they're supposed to do later you

01:10:36.960 --> 01:10:42.320
that it's a wheel of pain as I said you later indicate that their confession wasn't sufficient

01:10:42.320 --> 01:10:46.640
or sincere enough and you pull up some little detail where they fell short to point out that

01:10:46.640 --> 01:10:51.200
they didn't really mean it they're not really on board they still have internalized transphobia

01:10:51.200 --> 01:10:58.000
or whatever to initiate another round of struggle the melu control and demand for purity come together

01:10:58.000 --> 01:11:02.720
to create a uniquely exquisite psychological environment lyftons very clear about this

01:11:02.720 --> 01:11:07.760
in this environment almost everyone believes everyone else is pure while they themselves are

01:11:07.760 --> 01:11:15.680
not by the way if you search I actually did do a podcast about this chapter of lyfton specifically

01:11:15.680 --> 01:11:20.480
where I read I think the whole thing if not very close to it so you can go listen to lyftons full

01:11:20.480 --> 01:11:25.520
exposes exposition on this on new discourses and another podcast I'll think of the title

01:11:25.520 --> 01:11:30.240
scenario later but if you search go to the search bar and type in lyfton you can figure out which

01:11:30.240 --> 01:11:38.080
podcast is lyftons and I read the entire chapter of his book for for this topic but anyway sorry

01:11:38.080 --> 01:11:42.400
this is I was talking about the unique psychological environment an exquisite psychological environment

01:11:42.400 --> 01:11:47.360
created by melu control and demand for purity so you're in a completely controlled environment

01:11:47.360 --> 01:11:53.440
and your purity demands are high and you're being manipulated all the time mystical manipulation

01:11:53.440 --> 01:11:58.000
and what it results in is that almost everyone believes that everyone else is pure while they

01:11:58.000 --> 01:12:04.240
themselves are not think about that everyone you look around at is somehow a saint because

01:12:04.240 --> 01:12:08.320
everybody else got cancelled and thrown out by the way everyone else is a saint of the ideology

01:12:08.320 --> 01:12:13.120
but you nobody will tell how they are secretly transphobic nobody will come up it's like the

01:12:13.120 --> 01:12:20.080
time I had this young woman come up to me and the friend of the family and she came up and

01:12:20.080 --> 01:12:23.920
asked if she could talk to me because she knows my stance on these things and she said I want to

01:12:23.920 --> 01:12:27.360
talk to you because I know I can can tell you this and I have something I have to say and I was

01:12:27.360 --> 01:12:31.200
like what is it and she said I'm just done with the pronoun thing and she started crying because

01:12:31.200 --> 01:12:34.000
she didn't have anybody she could tell she was done with the pronoun thing she thought the pronoun

01:12:34.000 --> 01:12:39.200
thing was ridiculous so she knew she had this inner sin against the trans doctrine or the

01:12:39.200 --> 01:12:45.840
queer theory doctrine that the pronoun rituals ridiculous and it's just demanding and it's

01:12:45.840 --> 01:12:50.160
compelled speech but she didn't feel like she could tell anybody that so she thought she alone

01:12:50.160 --> 01:12:56.160
among her she came to me to tell me because she thought she alone alone in the world completely

01:12:56.160 --> 01:13:02.880
isolated felt that way and she had to find some forbidden outsider to tell it to so the feeling

01:13:02.880 --> 01:13:08.560
is that you're the only one falling short even though sometimes you see your so-called classmates

01:13:08.560 --> 01:13:13.120
confessing to their own failures and then at that point you're like well at least it's not me and

01:13:13.120 --> 01:13:20.080
you join in the denouncing of them motivated by your own sense of hidden shame because you are

01:13:20.080 --> 01:13:25.040
led to feel like you are alone and that you alone have the deepest darkest failures against the

01:13:25.040 --> 01:13:30.800
cult doctrine which is impossible and the guilt and shame are so overwhelming that they fuel even

01:13:30.800 --> 01:13:37.360
more accusation and criticism and confession which is self-criticism just by virtue of how

01:13:37.360 --> 01:13:42.080
they make you feel and that is the part of the environment the cult environment that does the

01:13:42.080 --> 01:13:48.320
bulk of the indoctrination or brainwashing or thought reform work what is it brainwashing you

01:13:48.320 --> 01:13:54.960
into well fifth lift and describes what he calls that all cults have at the center or all ideological

01:13:54.960 --> 01:14:00.640
totalist environments have at the center a sacred science so at the heart of every cult is what

01:14:00.640 --> 01:14:07.360
lyfton refers to as a sacred science that is infallible people can and do fail it all the time

01:14:07.360 --> 01:14:14.480
but the doctrine itself cannot fail you've probably heard that before it's in this case it would be

01:14:14.480 --> 01:14:19.280
queer theory cannot fail but people can fail queer theory and people are being brainwashed

01:14:19.280 --> 01:14:25.440
into that sacred science the point of the cult of confession is to create a dynamic that forces

01:14:25.440 --> 01:14:29.840
people to confess their failure to understand internalize and act and even embody the sacred

01:14:29.840 --> 01:14:34.880
science the point of kevin kumashiro's leading people into emotional crisis and structuring

01:14:34.880 --> 01:14:40.560
the environment around them so they resolve it productively is to lead them to internalize

01:14:40.560 --> 01:14:46.320
and act and even embody the sacred science all while accusing others of their failings as much

01:14:46.320 --> 01:14:53.360
and often as possible in the name of helping them in the same way the point of the confession is to

01:14:53.360 --> 01:14:58.960
get people to willingly adopt the lens of the sacred science in this case queer theory so that

01:14:58.960 --> 01:15:05.600
they can learn to quote recognize their crimes against the sacred science and the society aka

01:15:05.600 --> 01:15:12.560
cult that supports it and to pledge to do better pledging to do better means ideologically remolding

01:15:12.560 --> 01:15:19.200
yourself to use mouths words for it and here queer theory is given as the sacred science the

01:15:19.200 --> 01:15:23.920
one true correct understanding of sex gender sexuality and all the normal features of society

01:15:23.920 --> 01:15:28.560
and its definitions of what is and is not legitimate it is more than we're going to cover today but

01:15:28.560 --> 01:15:34.560
it's a critical constructivist ideology of sex gender and sexuality which believes is sex gender

01:15:34.560 --> 01:15:39.280
and sexuality are ultimately socially constructed phenomena that are the products of dominant power

01:15:39.280 --> 01:15:45.520
that imprison people in a life that is structured by the power dynamics of society and it is their

01:15:45.520 --> 01:15:54.640
obligation to wake up to that fact and to denounce all norms and legitimacy in order to try to overthrow

01:15:54.640 --> 01:16:04.080
that system sixth lyfton calls it doctrine over person cults place doctrine over people if we

01:16:04.080 --> 01:16:08.960
quote from hegel as i like to do at times like this history uses people and then discards them

01:16:10.400 --> 01:16:17.360
the person isn't even a person in the eyes of the cult if they don't hold to and enact the doctrine

01:16:17.920 --> 01:16:24.080
as mal said not to have correct political opinions is like not having a soul

01:16:25.600 --> 01:16:30.400
i don't really need to elaborate on how doctrine operates over people you're not really a person

01:16:30.400 --> 01:16:35.920
and you can't be associated with unless you are involved in and support the doctrine seventh

01:16:37.440 --> 01:16:42.560
lyfton lo calls it loading the language do i have to describe how queer theory loads the

01:16:42.560 --> 01:16:46.880
language all the words mean more than one things everything's got an agenda tucked in it

01:16:46.880 --> 01:16:53.840
we're all very familiar with the language stuff now inclusion belonging diversity hate this is all

01:16:53.840 --> 01:16:59.280
heavily loaded language that all advances the acceptance and spread of the agenda of the cult

01:16:59.280 --> 01:17:06.160
and keeps people locked into it and eighth lyfton says the last characteristic of cults is dispensing

01:17:06.160 --> 01:17:10.640
of existence and he says at the deepest level i'm not quoting him here i'm paraphrasing him

01:17:10.640 --> 01:17:18.000
the cult decides whose existence counts and whose doesn't the punchline of this is that those who

01:17:18.000 --> 01:17:23.280
accept the cult doctrine which is the sacred science and its application are considered people

01:17:23.280 --> 01:17:29.840
and no one else is it's like they don't have a soul my is what mal said only the doctrine

01:17:29.840 --> 01:17:36.400
nearly legitimate are allowed to exist at least in a spiritual sense everyone else is some kind of a

01:17:36.400 --> 01:17:43.600
fallen deplorable hater effectively enemies and non people which justifies their abuse

01:17:43.600 --> 01:17:48.400
their disenfranchisement their silencing cutting them out of your life even if they're your parents

01:17:48.400 --> 01:17:54.000
and so on that's a cult environment and queer theory as you can see very easily satisfies

01:17:54.000 --> 01:18:00.480
all of that just kind of for fun um the standard iron law of woke projection of course always applies

01:18:00.480 --> 01:18:05.280
because it never misses and the dispensing of existence aspect of the cult environment says

01:18:05.280 --> 01:18:09.760
kind of why woke activists always say everything is denying their existence or a genocide you know

01:18:09.760 --> 01:18:14.880
they always say oh you deny our existence unless you give us gender affirming care uh it's a trans

01:18:14.880 --> 01:18:18.880
genocide they're projecting what's happening is they're projecting it's the iron law of woke

01:18:18.880 --> 01:18:23.760
projection their belief is that you don't have a right to exist if your beliefs quote unquote

01:18:23.760 --> 01:18:29.040
deny their right to exist which is in quotes because you aren't denying their right to exist

01:18:29.040 --> 01:18:33.920
you're denying their political identity which isn't even a real identity in queer theory this

01:18:33.920 --> 01:18:40.160
means if you don't affirm their embodied political activism against everything legitimate and normal

01:18:40.160 --> 01:18:45.200
then you're denying their existence it's like how they have fat studies people which took this idea

01:18:45.200 --> 01:18:51.120
from queer theory by the way say that if you were to encourage weight loss programs and fitness and

01:18:51.120 --> 01:18:56.720
eating better and losing weight um that what you would do is a fat genocide because if all the people

01:18:56.720 --> 01:19:00.240
lost weight and there are no fat people there would be no fat culture and so you've committed a fat

01:19:00.240 --> 01:19:03.920
genocide by getting rid of all the fat people and you say well we didn't get rid of anybody and

01:19:03.920 --> 01:19:08.640
they say well there's no fat people so you get rid of fat people um and you think i'm making it up

01:19:08.640 --> 01:19:15.120
but that's how they think and um because you are apparently willing to do a genocide of that kind

01:19:15.120 --> 01:19:20.320
or a cultural genocide you're therefore beyond the pale of humanity and do not deserve to exist

01:19:20.320 --> 01:19:25.680
that's actually the cult's logic and that's the logic of all totalitarian genocides that's it

01:19:26.320 --> 01:19:30.320
the people who you know we have we have a communist utopia on the other side we have a queer

01:19:30.320 --> 01:19:36.480
horizon of possibility and potentiality but transphobes and selfish capitalists and so on

01:19:36.480 --> 01:19:40.880
won't let us have it so we've got to get rid of them we would already have communism socialism

01:19:40.880 --> 01:19:45.040
would already be working great we would already have a communist utopia but some people are selfish

01:19:45.040 --> 01:19:50.160
and won't won't give up their private property so let's just go seize their farms and get the

01:19:50.160 --> 01:19:54.800
program going we could open our society back up you know if if everybody would just get their

01:19:54.800 --> 01:19:59.040
vaccines if everybody would just 100% of everybody just got all their shots then we could just get

01:19:59.040 --> 01:20:05.760
our economy back same logic all totalitarian genocides come from this darkest piece of cult

01:20:05.760 --> 01:20:10.720
logic we could go a lot deeper into the nature of the queer theory cult and how it's a cult in this

01:20:10.720 --> 01:20:15.920
i'm sure i will in future podcasts i'm not going to drag it out um i'm not going to get into the

01:20:15.920 --> 01:20:21.120
whole gnostic hermetic conception of the world with normal society acting like a evil spirit

01:20:21.120 --> 01:20:26.720
that imprisons everyone into performing a fake persona for the world that's gender performativity

01:20:26.720 --> 01:20:30.720
so they can never be liberated to be who they truly are i've done that at length in other

01:20:30.720 --> 01:20:34.240
podcasts i'll probably do it again i think there's one actually called queer theory is queer

01:20:34.240 --> 01:20:37.680
narcissism or something you should go listen to that should also read the querying of the american

01:20:37.680 --> 01:20:45.040
child where we cover this in tremendous depth um that would get us into talking about judith butler

01:20:45.040 --> 01:20:52.160
when a queer theory's uh founding mothers i suppose fathers i mean whatever and her belief

01:20:52.160 --> 01:20:57.680
that gender and sex aren't actually real but her performances we already talked about that um we learned

01:20:58.320 --> 01:21:05.040
repeat those performances in order to satisfy normal society which is now acting like a

01:21:05.040 --> 01:21:10.400
gnostic demiurge her whole body of work could be summarized like i said before in the six words

01:21:10.400 --> 01:21:14.640
drag is life and life is drag so everybody's always doing drag and everything that they do

01:21:14.640 --> 01:21:19.760
whether they realize it or not because society writes the scripts for how we do drag which is

01:21:19.760 --> 01:21:26.320
usually cis hetero um and that we just do that and in her language borrowing from foucault she says

01:21:26.320 --> 01:21:32.480
that imprisons their souls which they then have to script physically on that's her word script

01:21:32.480 --> 01:21:37.840
them physically onto their body or inscribe onto their body and script into the society through

01:21:37.840 --> 01:21:43.840
their bodies by performing gender and becoming aware of this doingness of gender maybe one day

01:21:43.840 --> 01:21:49.040
already doing gender as a podcast as a paper that gets it's super influential that gets overlooked

01:21:49.040 --> 01:21:54.400
a lot um but being coming out for judith butler becoming aware of the doingness of gender and

01:21:54.400 --> 01:21:58.800
even sex and sexuality opens the door to that queer horizon of possibilities beyond the norm

01:22:00.560 --> 01:22:06.800
she got those ideas in turn from michelle foucault we already talked about him

01:22:07.280 --> 01:22:13.920
uh also from uh the radical feminism she was embedded in which would be Simone de Beauvoir

01:22:16.560 --> 01:22:19.760
we could get really deep into that we've kind of done it before uh

01:22:23.120 --> 01:22:29.280
what do i want to say here um the idea though is that you know society forces you to imprison

01:22:29.280 --> 01:22:36.320
yourself uh in a gender performance or a mode of presentation and that you can break free of

01:22:36.320 --> 01:22:42.640
that prison by understanding it um we're not going to get into the whole john money side of things

01:22:42.640 --> 01:22:47.920
and stroller and greenson and the idea of gender identity that's another podcast for another day

01:22:47.920 --> 01:22:54.000
but it it's basically what they did is kind of discombobulated the idea of who we are

01:22:54.000 --> 01:23:01.440
by misusing the synonym for sex that is gender um initially likely as a synonym but then by

01:23:01.440 --> 01:23:06.000
divorcing it from sex entirely that's its own story we're not going to get into the

01:23:06.000 --> 01:23:11.280
i mean i did a podcast on this feminist something about feminist nosticism you can look it up

01:23:11.280 --> 01:23:16.640
where i talk about uh Simone de Beauvoir and the pressing question of what is a woman

01:23:16.640 --> 01:23:22.880
one is not born but becomes woman she said and her point was the same as foucault's about homosexuals

01:23:22.880 --> 01:23:27.520
what does it mean to be a woman when no one else in particular society and patriarchy

01:23:28.160 --> 01:23:35.200
get to tell you what it means to be a woman uh or for foucault a homosexual which

01:23:35.200 --> 01:23:41.520
Halprin says means queer so in short we really could summarize this as a reconceptualization

01:23:41.520 --> 01:23:46.880
of what i call social nosticism in which we are imprisoned by the features of our social reality

01:23:46.880 --> 01:23:52.640
but can escape at least socio-spiritually with the right hidden insights about who we really are

01:23:52.640 --> 01:23:58.320
and into what world we have been flung or thrown that's a hadegra reference if you don't know it

01:23:58.320 --> 01:24:03.760
and that um by doing so that we might actually achieve liberation or emancipation that's why

01:24:03.760 --> 01:24:10.800
their language is this way um this is a transformative social nosticism that reconceives

01:24:10.800 --> 01:24:19.120
of the uh mysticism of earlier ages um that's a lot to get into about how characters such as

01:24:19.120 --> 01:24:26.240
rousseau and hagel and marx preceding bivouar foucault and butler or even swedenborg and

01:24:27.120 --> 01:24:34.640
jakaboma and some of these other characters maybe viko geambattista viko and some others all led

01:24:34.640 --> 01:24:40.480
to this um social alchemy as described by the way and you should listen to my george soros podcast

01:24:40.480 --> 01:24:46.320
about social alchemy but with queer theory and queer education in particular and social justice

01:24:46.320 --> 01:24:51.440
education more broadly one of its primary laboratories for this mysticism is our children

01:24:51.440 --> 01:24:56.240
and we should be really upset but we also should ask the question why children why does queer

01:24:56.240 --> 01:25:01.680
theory target kids why is it so interested in children which is one of the characteristics

01:25:01.680 --> 01:25:06.240
that i gave remember i said queer theory is the doctrine of a religious cult that cult is based

01:25:06.240 --> 01:25:12.560
on sex it is little or nothing to do with gay people and it primarily targets children well

01:25:12.560 --> 01:25:19.760
four reasons really first children are in schools typically and even with their entertainment uh

01:25:19.760 --> 01:25:24.800
they are a captive environment captive audience in schools they have to go to school for 30 35

01:25:24.800 --> 01:25:30.800
hours a week even if unless they're very strictly monitored in homeschooling the curriculum standards

01:25:30.800 --> 01:25:35.760
are usually including this and so they're a captive audience second children have not achieved the

01:25:35.760 --> 01:25:40.960
necessary cortical development in their brains to distinguish reality from fantasy so the

01:25:40.960 --> 01:25:46.320
mystifications of queer theory can be considered plausible to them where adults would be less

01:25:46.320 --> 01:25:52.080
interested third children are going through the developmental process processes i should say of

01:25:52.080 --> 01:25:58.560
identity formation and puberty which need to be hijacked for this ideology to take firm root

01:25:59.360 --> 01:26:04.320
just it's so tumultuous to grow up but you are also literally going through the process of figuring

01:26:04.320 --> 01:26:10.560
out who you are which is a whole thing and they have to take advantage of that in order to get

01:26:10.560 --> 01:26:14.560
queer theory to really take root but finally children become and this is really important from

01:26:14.560 --> 01:26:18.720
the marxist perspective that queer theory is queer marxism again read queering of the american

01:26:18.720 --> 01:26:23.840
child and really get your head around this it's important but children become a gateway into

01:26:23.840 --> 01:26:30.960
families and they become a wedge into not just families but also other targets families faiths

01:26:30.960 --> 01:26:37.360
and any institutions they grow up to become a part of they have to have a bottom up demand

01:26:37.360 --> 01:26:42.320
that they're trying to force into our kids through brainwashing them at school to demand

01:26:42.320 --> 01:26:48.880
the inclusive policies so they can have the ability to install them by what looks like

01:26:48.880 --> 01:26:54.560
dint of demand rather than totalitarian top-down force that's how they're trying to get around that

01:26:55.680 --> 01:26:59.920
okay so now we can summarize what is queer theory it's a doctrine of religious cult the

01:26:59.920 --> 01:27:04.080
cult is primarily sex-based it predominantly targets children it has little nothing to do

01:27:04.080 --> 01:27:10.240
with being gay and what can we do about it well normally we would turn to our institutions and

01:27:10.240 --> 01:27:15.520
ask them to see the light and step in but we can't do that this isn't working our institutions are

01:27:15.520 --> 01:27:19.440
actually captured our medical institutions or educational institutions or government institutions

01:27:19.440 --> 01:27:25.600
or entertainment institutions or media institutions they're captured we face a problem of captured

01:27:25.600 --> 01:27:30.480
institutions there's a like to phrase it now ideologically contaminated institutions our

01:27:30.480 --> 01:27:36.400
institutions accept and promote queer theory all the way up to the white house we therefore cannot

01:27:36.400 --> 01:27:41.600
count on our institutions educational psychological medical governmental anything to help us here

01:27:41.600 --> 01:27:47.680
they're all captured what do we do they are part of the controlled melu in lyfton's language

01:27:47.680 --> 01:27:52.560
they are creating the mystical manipulation they are peddling the sacred science of queer theory

01:27:52.560 --> 01:27:58.080
they are in short the center of the problem so what's this like here's an analogy it's like

01:27:58.080 --> 01:28:03.200
being a pilot and you're flying the plane and imagine all your instruments go out right so

01:28:03.200 --> 01:28:09.840
you're flying the plane you're you're a pilot and everything goes out on the aircraft right no

01:28:09.840 --> 01:28:15.360
navigation computer no altimeter nothing what do you have to do that's us we have our institutions

01:28:15.360 --> 01:28:20.560
are like our our instruments what do you have to do if you're that pilot because this tells us

01:28:20.560 --> 01:28:24.800
what we're going to do so imagine picture yourself in the cockpit you're flying a plane

01:28:25.760 --> 01:28:30.160
and all you're in the air and all of a sudden all your instruments go out what do you have to do

01:28:31.040 --> 01:28:38.400
you have to fly the plane safely mechanically and find a runway and land you don't get to rely on

01:28:38.400 --> 01:28:42.320
your instruments because you don't have them like i said no navigation computer no altimeter

01:28:42.960 --> 01:28:49.200
no speedometer nothing you have you you have your experience you have your wits and you're

01:28:49.200 --> 01:28:53.520
hopefully the weather is good and you have enough ability to see what's in front of you to do the

01:28:53.520 --> 01:28:58.320
right thing that's all you get that's like us our institutions are like the instruments in that

01:28:58.320 --> 01:29:02.560
cockpit but for society not for an airplane and right now they're putting out all the wrong

01:29:02.560 --> 01:29:08.640
information consistently they will not help us find a runway or land the plane safely and if we

01:29:08.640 --> 01:29:13.440
take the plane analogy seriously our lives and the lives of everybody in the plane aka our society

01:29:13.440 --> 01:29:19.120
depend on us doing this so what would we do in that situation we would use our senses we would

01:29:19.120 --> 01:29:25.680
trust our eyes and ears in other words we would use our senses directly to look for the runway to

01:29:25.680 --> 01:29:31.680
line up lower the plane land it and slow down and stop we wouldn't be looking to the broken

01:29:31.680 --> 01:29:36.480
instruments at all we wouldn't be looking off into space we would look at reality around us and

01:29:36.480 --> 01:29:42.000
navigate without the instruments as the intermediary and that's what we need to start finding ways to do

01:29:42.000 --> 01:29:47.120
now at the societal level one individual at a time we need to start figuring out how to look

01:29:47.120 --> 01:29:54.480
around us assess what's really going on and make smart judicious action where if we or if

01:29:54.480 --> 01:29:58.960
we're rash if you just jerk the wheel or pull the throttle or whatever you're still going to crash

01:29:58.960 --> 01:30:04.320
and everything's going to go bad we have to make smart decisions that take into account reality

01:30:05.440 --> 01:30:10.800
individually what does that mean what do you do well what you start with is the truth not some

01:30:10.800 --> 01:30:15.280
mediated truth peddled by these corrupt institutions but the plain simple truth the kind that you

01:30:15.280 --> 01:30:20.000
can see with your eyes and experience and everybody knows like that there are two sexes that people

01:30:20.000 --> 01:30:26.080
can't change sex that most people are straight that gay happens we don't know why that's fine

01:30:26.080 --> 01:30:30.880
queer is not an identity it's a defiant political stance we don't have to tolerate or accommodate

01:30:30.880 --> 01:30:35.280
how can you know that one with your own senses because it's in the fucking book defining it guys

01:30:35.280 --> 01:30:40.000
it's in black and white they wrote it down themselves so if they tell you that you have that

01:30:40.000 --> 01:30:44.880
information so if someone claims to have an identity or sexuality that requires an explanation

01:30:44.880 --> 01:30:50.400
to put it simply it's fake that's that's common sense right if somebody claims to have an identity

01:30:50.400 --> 01:30:54.400
or sexuality that requires an explanation it's fake and doesn't demand our respect

01:30:54.960 --> 01:30:59.280
we don't have to respect this we have to be nice we're not nice we have to be

01:31:01.760 --> 01:31:06.880
human to people we have to realize that the people in this cult are people in a cult

01:31:06.880 --> 01:31:12.080
and they need help they need deprogramming they need therefore patience and compassion

01:31:12.080 --> 01:31:17.280
and a landing pad and lots of things but we also have to recognize that there's a lot of predatory

01:31:17.280 --> 01:31:22.560
behavior happening and predator predatory behavior of any kind in any place is not something that we

01:31:22.560 --> 01:31:27.920
have to support or enable perversion outside of the confines if you want to call it this

01:31:27.920 --> 01:31:33.200
of consenting adults acting in private does not deserve our tolerance and shouldn't be given it

01:31:34.080 --> 01:31:38.000
our schools should not be doing any of this our schools should not be pushing

01:31:38.640 --> 01:31:43.200
our kids into emotional crisis and then resolving it productively that's child abuse

01:31:44.080 --> 01:31:48.800
our schools should not be putting pornography in front of our children whether it's in class

01:31:48.800 --> 01:31:55.280
or through their libraries or through the curriculum through any various tricks and children do not

01:31:55.280 --> 01:32:00.560
benefit from its presence there enough of this this is the kind of stuff is that you can start to

01:32:00.560 --> 01:32:04.240
first recognize get your bearings if you're in that plane you've got to figure out what the

01:32:04.240 --> 01:32:07.840
heck's going on you've got to get your bearings for yourself that's what i'm talking about wait a

01:32:07.840 --> 01:32:13.200
minute porn in the schools what the hell what push kids into an emotional crisis and resolve it

01:32:13.200 --> 01:32:17.760
according to our doctrine that's a problem what are you going to do you've got to assess what's

01:32:17.760 --> 01:32:22.320
going on you've got to stop listening to the to the gas lighting in the bs and get your head on

01:32:22.320 --> 01:32:27.840
straight you've got a plane to land and you don't have instruments in fact you have worse no

01:32:27.840 --> 01:32:34.080
instruments you have lying instruments and with the where that is is in the truth so you've

01:32:34.080 --> 01:32:40.160
got to look for the truth and you really have to look for it and you have to tell other people it

01:32:40.160 --> 01:32:43.200
what i say a lot and you've heard this before i did a podcast on this is that you have to love the

01:32:43.200 --> 01:32:47.360
truth i kind of riff from the bible you have to love the truth with all your heart and all your

01:32:47.360 --> 01:32:51.760
mind and all your soul and all your strength and you have to love your neighbor enough to tell your

01:32:51.760 --> 01:32:58.560
neighbor the truth as you would have him tell you the truth these are basic commandments this is

01:32:58.560 --> 01:33:04.400
this this is how it sounds like that's not enough it's everything at the beginning and then you put

01:33:04.400 --> 01:33:10.320
that into practice and you can fix the world but you really do have to love the truth because if

01:33:10.320 --> 01:33:14.720
you love the truth you'll say it you won't care if they call you transphobic you'll seek it you'll

01:33:14.720 --> 01:33:20.240
read these awful books you'll defend it when you get under attack or somebody else says you'll defend

01:33:20.240 --> 01:33:24.640
other people who are saying it you'll support them you'll back them up you have to love the truth

01:33:24.640 --> 01:33:28.400
because if you don't eventually the splc is going to write an article about you and you're going to

01:33:28.400 --> 01:33:33.360
back off you'll buckle they're going to threaten to take something away from you or your kids that

01:33:33.360 --> 01:33:38.560
you can't bear and you'll buckle and you'll get pulled into this caring affirming nonsense

01:33:40.400 --> 01:33:44.000
but the fact of the matter is that there's no caring and there's no affirmation that isn't

01:33:44.000 --> 01:33:48.080
first built on the truth so you're going to have to love the truth and you're going to have to

01:33:48.080 --> 01:33:54.320
to push it and defend it and help other people do it in tough situations there's no other way

01:33:54.960 --> 01:34:00.320
and every time you tell a lie just remember this every time you tell a lie to to be nice or to fit

01:34:00.320 --> 01:34:04.960
in the pronoun game or whatever you're selling a piece of your soul so you have to stop doing that

01:34:05.600 --> 01:34:10.560
and that's what it means really to love the truth and if you start there telling the truth that's

01:34:10.560 --> 01:34:14.320
what solzhenichin said is that if you tell the truth one man telling the truth can bring down a

01:34:14.320 --> 01:34:18.880
regime it starts a ripple effect one person telling the truth is a lot becomes a lot of people

01:34:18.880 --> 01:34:23.200
telling the truth facts start to come out then there's more things to tell the w path files come out

01:34:23.200 --> 01:34:27.760
next thing you know this entire medical monstrosity starts to crumble out from under and you say well

01:34:27.760 --> 01:34:31.760
we can't get the law to go along this we can't get the courts to agree with us keep fighting because

01:34:31.760 --> 01:34:36.160
day by day by day something else comes out keep digging somebody had to go look up what's going

01:34:36.160 --> 01:34:42.000
on at w path whether it's me a hues or whoever digging into it um there's other revelations

01:34:42.000 --> 01:34:46.960
i guess i do no harm just release them the daily color just release them somebody's digging into

01:34:46.960 --> 01:34:51.920
it so start digging get curious ask questions read the materials figure out who's funding it

01:34:51.920 --> 01:34:56.720
whatever happens to be and then report on it and when you do these things which is what it means

01:34:56.720 --> 01:35:01.680
to be based by the way you break the melu control and you can start to break apart the cult you also

01:35:01.680 --> 01:35:09.280
need to protect your kids obviously um to keep them out of the controlled melu uh into one that

01:35:09.360 --> 01:35:13.120
you children are supposed to be in a sheltered melu and the parents are in charge of that

01:35:13.120 --> 01:35:18.080
sheltering um you also when you do these things you tell the truth you seek the truth you fight

01:35:18.080 --> 01:35:23.760
for the truth you defend the truth every day you don't just break melu control you but you break

01:35:23.760 --> 01:35:28.800
apart mystical manipulation they can't trick you if they end up doing this huge stage demonstrate

01:35:28.800 --> 01:35:34.160
demonstration and you say that's planned spontaneity and it's fake it makes it lose its magical power

01:35:35.120 --> 01:35:42.000
you by doing this cast doubt upon the so-called sacred science gender ideology starts looking

01:35:42.000 --> 01:35:47.120
not just even incorrect but ridiculous and the more people who think it's ridiculous the more

01:35:47.120 --> 01:35:51.840
people who will either loudly or quietly walk away from it what happens when you start doing this

01:35:51.840 --> 01:35:56.320
and start doing it consistently and start doing it every day like billboard chris showing up one

01:35:56.320 --> 01:36:01.600
conversation at a time getting clear on his pursuing the information getting clear getting out there

01:36:01.600 --> 01:36:07.360
and talking to people as you start to break those cycles of abuse you break the cult of confession

01:36:07.360 --> 01:36:11.440
you tell people that it's okay to trust their eyes and their ears and even their gut intuition

01:36:11.440 --> 01:36:16.800
and to believe in common sense again and to understand therefore very clearly that what

01:36:16.800 --> 01:36:21.760
they are experiencing and seeing in queer theory is abusive and manipulative because queer theory

01:36:21.760 --> 01:36:26.320
is the doctrine as i said of a cult religion that is based on sex that primarily targets

01:36:26.320 --> 01:36:32.000
their children has very little to do nothing to do really with being gay it's hostile in fact to

01:36:32.000 --> 01:36:38.480
gay interests in every regard if we might use this phrase gay interests and so it's our necessary

01:36:38.480 --> 01:36:43.760
responsibility to learn as much about it as we can both in theory and in practice and to

01:36:43.760 --> 01:36:50.800
tell people about it and oppose it um like i said you can read a lot of what i had to say here

01:36:50.800 --> 01:36:55.680
in my book with logan lansing it's his book really that i helped with called the querying of the american

01:36:55.680 --> 01:37:02.800
child um i hope this was a informative episode it was a lot longer than i meant um i gave this

01:37:02.800 --> 01:37:08.800
talk at pit in like 45 minutes and here we are at almost an hour and 40 but i hope you'll forgive me

01:37:09.680 --> 01:37:15.600
more to come soon i've got more horrifying un documents and other things coming so thank

01:37:15.600 --> 01:37:31.520
you for listening and i'll catch you in the next one

01:37:45.600 --> 01:37:47.060
you
