0	23840	Here everybody, it's James Lindsay, you're listening to the New Discourses podcast and
23840	26160	it's time to talk some more about queer theory.
26960	30400	I want to make the case, and I suppose there's a bit of billion ways I could do this,
30400	33600	I want to make the case that queer theory is the doctrine of a sex-based cult.
34400	41360	That's it. In other words, to put it more frankly, or more clearly I suppose, queer theory,
41360	49840	which pretends to be an academic discipline, is the doctrine of a religious cult that primarily
49840	57680	targets children, and that is based on sex and topics related to sex, and that sex meant in both
57680	64560	meanings of the word, both the biological fact and the activity, which is related to the biological
64560	73680	fact incidentally, and it has very little to do with gay identity. So those are the main points
73680	78160	of contention. Some of you will recognize, if you're readers as well, that what I'm going to do
78160	87680	in this episode is actually summarize, or mostly run through and ad-lib off of a essay that I
87680	94560	published on New Discourses in February after I gave this as a talk in Pittsburgh at the University
94560	100000	of Pittsburgh, which is the one where people dressed as clowns came to protest me. And if you
100000	105760	remember that image on the website, you know what I'm talking about. It was an amusing little story.
106720	112880	The clowns were outside, I didn't see them, then the clowns came in, I did see them, and there was
112880	119920	one clown actually and her friend, and about five minutes into the talk, about the time I'd given
119920	124960	like the basic introduction and some serious facts, she started crying, got up and left,
124960	130160	and called her mom so loudly that you could hear her kind of blubber into the phone,
130800	138160	hey mom, as she walked out, and no further incidents were recorded. But the way I started
138160	142720	off was as strongly as possible by saying exactly what I just said. I'm here to talk about queer
142720	146960	theory and its major points can be summarized very easily. Queer theory is the doctrine of a
146960	153040	religious cult that religious cult is based on sex. That's not the same as saying a sex cult,
153040	158560	by the way, that's actually different. It is based on sex in both regards, but it's not necessarily
159520	166560	sex as an activity oriented cult. And that sex based religious cult primarily targets children
166560	171280	and almost none of it has anything to do with gay people or gay identity. And all of that is
171280	177120	actually demonstrable in their literature. The least obvious of these points is that last point
177120	182320	that has nothing to do with gay people, and it's a great place to start. And the way I make this
182320	187200	case, I could point to an awful lot of their academic literature, drag queen story hour,
187200	193280	which I read their academic paper about drag pedagogy in the groomer school series,
193280	198720	I think it was groomer schools four. I read that paper talks about how the point of drag queen
198720	204800	story hour is not actually for LGBT empathy. It's not even about LGBT identity. It's about awakening
204800	209600	a queer potential, queer horizon, living queerly, alternate modes of kinship, blah, blah, blah.
210480	214240	In other words, what queer theory is doing is hiding behind the gay identities,
214240	218080	and it doesn't even have much to do with them. The gold standard proof in their literature
218080	226000	comes from David Halperin, which he's a scholar who is the one who defined queer in queer theory
226000	232560	in his book from 1995 called Saint Foucault Toward a Gay Hagiography, which means toward
232560	238960	making him into a saint. Now Saint Foucault refers to Michel Foucault. People have heard me say Saint
238960	244400	Foucault referencing the book, particularly I did it at Oxford in my debate, and they thought I
244400	249280	was making a joke. No, it's literally the title of the friggin book. And you can actually go look
249280	254000	at this book and read how horrifying it is. It's impossible actually on anything that you want
254000	260960	to publish, you know, FCC guidelines or even the much looser online guidelines to read this book
260960	267840	to you, because it's too blatantly inappropriate. I mean, it occasionally talks about topics
268800	273520	like I don't even want to say it because I don't want the video to get demonetized.
275120	280320	Let's just say that it refers to putting fists in certain orifices very explicitly and refers to
280320	286880	it as a liberatory practice, and calls it anal yoga explicitly. I mean, you can get the book
286880	291600	and to search the term anal yoga, and you're going to find all of this right there in the book.
292560	299520	It's pretty shocking to read like a lot of queer theory, but David Halpern's book is kind of the
299520	303920	gold standard for defining the word queer. It's where the word queer was first defined. It's
303920	310320	like the first major treatise that lays out queer theory as queer theory and what it's aiming to
310320	314960	accomplish. Obviously, given the title, it's building off of the ideas of Michel Foucault,
314960	322320	who is this French postmodernist. He's also a pedophile. He was also a BDSM gay man. He
323360	331520	bragged about his experiences in bathhouses in San Francisco and elsewhere. There's some
331520	339760	very unfortunate stories regarding male children or boys around 11, 12, 13 in Tunisia that have come
339760	347280	out at any rate. That's who he's harkening back to, and what he's really pushing back to, he could
347280	353360	get into discipline and punish, birth of the clinic, civilization and madness, some of Foucault's
353360	359120	kind of groundbreaking, I guess, if you want work in what we would recognize now as critical
359120	365520	constructivism. But in this case, it's mostly the history of sexuality and primarily history
365520	371840	of sexuality volume one. And Foucault in that book is laying out what is the idea of a homosexual
371840	376800	in a very kind of parallel way to what Simone de Beauvoir was doing, laying out the concept of
376800	384800	what is a woman in the second sex in 1949. Although, allegedly, Foucault was not copying
384800	388960	Beauvoir. I don't know if that's the case or not. I'm not going to get into it. I'm not going to try
388960	392880	to parse it out today. What I am going to say, though, is that it's the same idea, is that the
392880	397600	homosexual should be defining himself on his own terms, and those terms have to be defiant to the
397600	404240	heterosexual, homosexual binary, and the power constructions built around it. And this idea
404240	410080	of an oppositionally defiant identity, political identity, against norms and expectations is what
410080	419040	Halperin said means queer. And in fact, he says that it means queer, where Foucault says the
419120	426880	homosexual, it can only be interpreted to mean queer. I probably have that citation somewhere
426880	432880	and could pull it up to read it to you, but I didn't plan to. I don't think I put it in this essay,
432880	439520	but it's an eye opener. But I'm going to read some from St. Foucault as it is,
440240	449440	just so that you can have a sense that this is not about gay identity. So the first words of
449440	456560	this relevant definition appear on page 62. That's the page in this book. You have to read 61 pages
456560	463120	of Jesus Christ. Could you just shut you weirdos before you get to the point where he defines
463200	469920	queer? And here's how that paragraph starts. The first three words, which are by a type setting
470560	478400	quirk, are in bold all caps are unlike gay identity. So when he sets out to define queer,
478400	483600	the first thing he says is it is unlike gay identity. It's something different than gay.
483600	489840	Queer is not the same as gay. This is why he had to do his whole exploration about the homosexual
490800	494160	from Foucault, because it's something different.
498400	507760	So what he explains the difference is, is that gay identities, as Halpern puts it,
507760	513280	are grounded in a positive fact. That means something about reality. They are grounded in
513280	522000	the positive fact of homosexuality. Now Halpern does not actually say that gay is something that
522000	528560	is intrinsic and essential to the person as an accident of birth, because he says that it's grounded
528560	536480	in the positive fact of homosexual object choice. That's his actual phrase, which means that it
536480	545280	might be the choosing of same-sex desire. He doesn't go so far as to say it's innate,
545280	554000	but he does say that it's real, the positive fact of homosexuality. Queer, he is contrasting to that,
554000	558720	and he says explicitly that it need not be based on any positive truth or in any stable
558720	564480	reality at all. And he says there is nothing in particular to which it refers. Queer doesn't
564480	569680	mean anything in particular is what he's saying. He calls it an identity without an essence. That
569680	578560	means, unlike gay identities, it is not based in reality. So what is queer if it is not based in
578560	584560	reality? It is a radical political view. In fact, if we want to pull from the Antonio Gramsci ideas
584560	591120	of cultural Marxism, it is a counter hegemonic idea. There's this idea that we have prevailing
591120	596080	cultural values and they tend to maintain themselves and transmit themselves and stabilize
596080	605680	people and themselves, and that's cultural hegemony. The way things are, and queer is a defiant
605680	612240	oppositional position against that. In other words, it's counter hegemonic. Just like Antonio
612240	618240	Gramsci said, the point of what we now call cultural Marxism or Western Marxism is to establish
618320	622720	counter hegemonic infiltration into our institutions. So bringing queer theory into
622720	627760	institutions, whether education, law, whatever happens to be, media doesn't matter.
628800	634080	Bringing queer theory into institutions is a counter hegemonic activity in line with
634080	641280	Gramsci's Western Marxism, which we often call cultural Marxism. Halperin tells us that queer
641280	648720	means adopting a politics that is against whatever the normal, the legitimate, and the
648720	655200	dominant are. And so you can tell I'm not just making it up. Here's exactly how he phrases it.
655760	661280	Unlike gay identity, which though deliberately proclaimed in an act of affirmation is
661280	667520	nonetheless rooted in the positive fact of homosexual object choice, queer identity
667520	674560	need not be grounded in any positive truth or in any stable reality. As the very word implies,
675200	681600	queer does not name some natural kind or refer to some determinate object.
682480	689280	See, it's not real. It acquires its meaning from its oppositional relation to the norm.
690080	697120	Queer is by definition whatever is at odds with the normal, the legitimate, the dominant.
697120	703760	There is nothing in particular to which it necessarily refers. It is an identity without
703760	710320	an essence. Now, I'm cutting off here a lot of how actually psychotic David Halperin is
711120	716880	when I present it this way. I have the book open, so I'll just read to you a little bit more. He
716880	723440	says queer then demarcates not a positivity, that means something real, but a positionality,
723440	729440	that means a politics, vis-a-vis the normative. Here's where it gets weird. They can't leave it
729440	735040	alone. A positionality that is not restricted to lesbians and gay men, so it's not really about
735040	742560	being gay, but is in fact available to anyone who is or feels marginalized. You don't even have to
742560	749520	be marginalized. You just have to feel marginalized because of her or his sexual practices. It could
749520	756000	include some married couples without children, for example, or even, who knows, some married couples
756000	762800	with children, with perhaps very naughty children. I'm just going to pause. What the hell is he
762800	766480	talking about? I'll let you speculate. What the hell is he talking about? Why does he say that it
766480	771520	could be couples who are married with very naughty children, very naughties and italics? What does
771520	779200	he mean here? Why do they always go there? But I'll continue the rest of the page. Queer, he says,
779200	785440	in any case, does not designate a class of already objectified pathologies or perversions,
785440	794160	so it's not just about that. Rather, it describes a horizon of possibility, just like communism
794160	799840	is a horizon of possibility for socialist praxis. It describes a horizon of possibility
799840	807040	whose precise extent and heterogeneous scope cannot, in principle, be delimited in advance.
808000	816160	It is queer Marxism, in other words. It is from the eccentric positionality occupied by the queer
816160	826080	subject, so it's subjective. It's not real, that it may become possible to envision a variety of
826080	833040	possibilities for reordering the relations among sexual behaviors, erotic identities, constructions
833040	844080	of gender, forms of knowledge, regimes of enunciation, logics of representation, modes of self-constitution,
844800	851520	and practices of community for restructuring, that is, the relations among power, truth,
852080	858720	and, of all things he could pick, desire. This is why in the Drag Queen Story Hour paper,
858720	863760	it says explicitly that Drag Queen Story Hour, or Queer Worldmaking, as I think what it actually
863760	871520	says, Queer Worldmaking, is always a project rooted in desire. He underscores his point, though,
871520	875840	that it's not about gay identities by saying that it's not restricted to lesbians and gay men,
875840	882720	but in fact that it's open to anyone who is or feels marginalized because of his or her sexual
882720	885840	practices. So what are we dealing with? We're dealing with something that doesn't have a lot
885840	891440	to do with gay identity at all when we're talking about queer and thus queer theory,
892160	898880	and we're talking about something that is rooted in sex because of his or her sexual practices.
898880	905040	It's right there in the text, it's extremely clear. But what is the conclusion that we draw from this
905040	911760	discussion that Halpern gives us, the defining characteristic of queer in queer theory? It
911760	918240	is that you cannot be queer. Do you understand me? There's no such thing as a queer identity.
918960	928560	There is, let me say it again, no such thing as a queer identity. You can only do queerness. You can
928560	934480	only act queer, and that's what it is. It's an act, and that's why with Judith Butler's work,
934480	939840	we see that her work could boil down to drag is life and life is drag, and that the enlightened
939840	944320	people or the people who know we're always doing a drag performance. What do I mean by that? If I'm
944320	949840	a man and I present as a man and look like a man and act like a man and am a man, I'm just doing
949840	956160	male drag as a man. And if I'm a woman and I'm doing female drag, or I'm sorry, if I'm a woman
956160	962960	and I present myself as a woman and live according to feminine choices and stereotypes
962960	967520	and activities and so on, I'm just doing female drag. And if I'm a male who does female drag,
967520	972640	I'm still just doing drag, but now I've chosen to do it. I'm not just doing it like a socialized
972640	981360	robot. I'm awake and I've chosen to do that in a defiance of the norm. So nobody is queer. People
981360	988160	feel queer against some standard. In other words, they feel defiantly opposed. And I keep using this
988160	992480	language, by the way, oppositional defiant. Oppositional defiant. Why? Because there's a
992480	997120	disorder known as oppositional defiant disorder, which seems to fit the bill here.
998880	1007600	They are people who feel and act against the norm and against legitimacy on purpose. So they are
1007600	1014480	not queer. They are acting queerly. And that means they are acting defiantly against normalcy and
1014480	1023280	legitimacy, while denying and even decrying reality. You can only perform queerness. That's
1023280	1029040	what Judith Butler's work is really about, gender performativity. You can only perform queerness,
1029040	1033280	but they think everything is a form of queerness. You just don't know. You're either upholding
1033280	1041520	the status quo, or you're rejecting it. So you can only perform queerness, or if you refuse
1041520	1047680	their liberatory politics as they see them, you can perform straightness instead. Performing
1047680	1052960	straightness to queer theory isn't being who you are if you're straight, just like gender
1052960	1057680	performance. It's just another kind of performance, one that upholds the allegedly oppressive status
1057680	1064400	quo instead of opposing it, which is thus problematic. We see the same theme in the
1064400	1070480	Drag Queen Story Hour paper from a couple of years ago. Let me see if I actually found this
1070480	1078400	other quote from Foucault, just to kind of really drive in the point. I know that I have it in this
1078400	1084320	other document. Yeah, he says, this is Halpern talking about Foucault, the homosexual. He says,
1084320	1089600	Foucault insisted that homosexuality did not name an already existing form of desire, but was rather
1090240	1095840	something to be desired. So it doesn't describe a way of being romantically or sexually attracted
1095840	1103440	to people. It's something that you want to become. It's an identity you seek to become.
1104080	1108720	He says, our task is therefore to become homosexual, that's quoting from Foucault,
1108720	1115040	not to persist in acknowledging that we are homosexual. Or to put it more precisely,
1115040	1121200	what Foucault meant is that our task is to become queer. For his remarks make sense only if he
1121200	1126640	understood the term homosexual according to my definition of queer. Remember we're reading David
1126640	1132960	Halpern here. As an identity without an essence, not a given condition, but a horizon of possibility,
1132960	1139760	an opportunity for self-transformation, a queer potential. Because one can't become homosexual
1139760	1148080	strictly speaking. Either one is or one isn't. But one can listen to this shit. One can marginalize
1148080	1156560	oneself. One can transform oneself. One can become queer. Indeed queer marks the very sight of gay
1156560	1165520	becoming. So that is what Halpern is saying is the point of queer theory. And that's what meshes
1165520	1170800	with the dry queen story hour paper that I was about to jump to. So I just want to remind you
1170800	1175920	that in that paper there is a section near the end titled From Empathy to Embodied Kinship. It makes
1175920	1181280	the same point we just made. That section makes the point that queer programs are presented as
1181280	1188560	improving LGBT empathy in their words. And that dry queen story hour makes use of such tropes again
1188560	1193600	their word. It then says that that's not really what dry queen story hour is about at all.
1195600	1199920	It says that's not what queer education or queer world making are about either.
1200480	1205840	Instead they use the so-called tropes of empathy strategically, that's their word,
1205840	1212240	as a marketing platform. That's their word too. To justify getting it into schools, libraries,
1212240	1218960	and in front of kids. But it's actually not about empathy at all. It's about leading the kids to see
1219600	1225440	the world in themselves in a queer way. In other words to lead them into a queer worldview. World
1225440	1233360	views, by the way, have ideologies. The ideology of the queer worldview is queer theory. So it is the
1233360	1239440	doctrine of a sex-based cult that primarily targets children should add through manipulation and
1239440	1244480	deception. And it has very little to do with gay people. Here's how it's worded in the dry queen
1244480	1249120	story hour paper in the relevant part. Finally they say it is often assumed that that's Lil Miss
1249120	1254880	Hot Mess and Harper Keenan. Drag queen at Arizona State University, whose real name is Harris
1254880	1263600	Cornstein. And Harper Keenan is a trans education researcher somewhere, I don't know, maybe Canada.
1264480	1269520	Finally they say it is often assumed that the primary pedagogical tool of queer education
1269520	1274720	should be to increase empathy toward LGBT people. That's what you've heard. That's why we're supposed
1274720	1279280	to have drag queen story hour because we have to care about the poor little gay kids who don't have
1279280	1284080	representation and apparently needed a drag queen to look at to feel represented. They go on to say
1284080	1289360	while this premise has some merit and it underlies many sincere projects and educational and cultural
1289360	1294400	work including drag queen story hour, the notion of empathy has also been critiqued by feminist
1294400	1299840	scholars of color and others for the ways in which, notice they throw that intersectional
1299840	1304880	kitchen sink. This is about drag queens but it's been critiqued by feminist scholars of color and
1304880	1311600	others for the ways in which empathy can enable an effective, emotional effective, A effective
1311600	1317360	with an A not an E, an effective appropriation of an individual's unique experiences and
1317360	1322240	reinforce hierarchies of power. That's a lot. But what they're saying is that when you can start,
1323200	1328000	basically that you can do munch housings by proxy, you can start to show empathy in order
1328000	1332320	to elevate yourself and thus cause problems for the people you're allegedly empathetic toward.
1333280	1338560	Whether through literature or virtual reality, these tropes tend to reflect an overstated ability
1338560	1343680	to understand difference as well as empathy's potential to preclude meaningful relationships
1343680	1349680	of solidarity. See, you can't be in solidarity with somebody you feel sorry for. They go on and
1349680	1354560	say it is undeniable that drag queen story hour participates in many of these tropes of empathy
1354560	1362240	from the marketing language the program uses to its selection of books. And here it is. Much of
1362240	1370320	this is done strategically in order to justify its educational value. However, we suggest that drag
1370320	1376640	supports scholars' critiques of empathy rather than reifying the concept. Reifying in the sense of
1376640	1381600	George Lukacz, one of the other founders or fathers of cultural Marxism, to means to make real
1382560	1390560	through social processes. This approach can, this is them again, this approach can support
1390560	1396000	students in finding the unique or queer aspects of themselves rather than attempting to understand
1396000	1402320	what it is like to be LGBT. So what they're telling you is that the point is grooming people into a
1402320	1408320	queer ideological worldview, children in particular, not about increasing empathy. It's not about
1408400	1412960	understanding. Duh, obviously, they aren't putting a drag queen in front of the kids because it's
1412960	1418080	trying to teach kids what it's like to be gay. Drag queens are a horrific represent like misrepresentation
1418080	1426320	of that phenomenon. It's to support students in finding the unique or queer aspects of themselves.
1426320	1432240	That's what it's really about. Drag queen story hour is not about empathy. That's their marketing
1432240	1438400	strategy and it is in fact to their eyes a bit problematic. So they know that they're lying
1438400	1444560	about it in a way that actually goes against their values in order to get it into the schools and
1444560	1448720	libraries and in front of children in general. But what it's really about is getting kids to
1448720	1455280	discover any aspects of themselves that they might feel uncomfortable about or marginalized because of
1455280	1460720	or different because of that might be able to be considered queer by a queer theorist or queer
1460800	1467360	educator so that those aspects can be nurtured in the sense of making them have more and more and
1467360	1474720	more discomfort about themselves and then until an initiatory rupture occurs so that they can
1474720	1483200	develop the children into a queer political stance that will then be conflated with being who they
1483200	1487600	really are. That's what's going on with queer theory. That's what Halpern is actually describing.
1487600	1492320	By calling them queer identities what you're doing is saying here's this political activity
1492320	1496720	and you're going to pretend that that political activity is who you are. By the way that political
1496720	1502560	activity is hating the world as it is and hating people for being normal and hating
1503760	1509920	anything that is is based in the idea of legitimacy. So oppositional defiant disorder
1510880	1518000	as a political stance that you're now going to consider to be who you are which is in fact
1518000	1524880	in the definition of queer not what it's about. So what will happen is they take these kids they
1524880	1531120	introduce them to queer potentialities by sticking a drag queen in front of them and then they make
1531120	1536240	them feel uncomfortable about themselves and they exploit that uncomfortable or emotional crisis or
1536240	1541200	whatever it is to make them feel isolated and alone and then they say there's a new way to
1541200	1546640	understand yourself and there's a new way to understand who you are and the world and why it
1546640	1553200	doesn't like you. So then they can awaken to some basic ideas of queer theory and more than that
1553200	1559920	they'll be told that they're not truly allowed to be who they really are. Society will object.
1560560	1564880	Their parents will object. In particular they'll focus on the objection to the parents because
1564880	1570000	they have to get the kids away from their parents whose parental duty and responsibility it is to
1570000	1577600	protect them from this kind of ideological and maybe worse grooming. In fact it's so likely that
1577600	1584320	their parents will reject this this discovery of who they really are as queer that it may have to be
1584320	1590560	kept secret from their parents in case it wouldn't be affirmed by them and don't worry the state
1591200	1596320	depending on what state you're in and now more than a dozen states will force your parents to
1596320	1601280	affirm this or threaten to take your children away or maybe take them away for real. I'm not supposed
1601280	1606640	to use I know the word grooming to describe this grotesque set of activities that's a part of a
1606640	1611920	major controversy. In fact it's part of it's one of the main reasons that these kids came dressed
1611920	1617760	as clowns to protest me at Pitt when I gave this talk but I'm not supposed to call these people
1617760	1622960	groomers because it makes the left mad that we call them what they are so I'm going to ask a
1622960	1628160	question instead. Instead of saying this is obviously groomer behavior and I know I already
1628160	1633120	did let's back up let's slow down let's be a little more careful Jim. I'm going to show you
1633120	1638080	something else from this paper and I'm going to ask this question what word am I supposed to use
1638080	1644640	for it. We've already talked about this idea of from empathy to embodied kinship but I'm going
1644640	1650480	to read something else from this paper and I want to know what word I am supposed to use for it.
1650480	1656480	Drag Queen Story Hour presents itself as family friendly in a way that characterizes itself as
1656480	1662480	a preparatory introduction to alternate modes of kinship. That's what it says. What does that mean?
1663840	1668880	What does that mean? Preparatory introduction to alternate modes of kinship. In fact it says the
1668880	1674560	family and family friendly refers to a queer code for the other queers they connect with on
1674560	1681600	the street rather than the family that's like the real family. So the Drag Queen Story Hour people
1681600	1687600	are not just lying about the idea that they use empathy but they're also lying about what they
1687600	1693360	mean by family when they sell it as family friendly. They tell us themselves in black and white that
1693360	1698880	they mean it is a queer code for a new family, a queer family, a drag family that Drag Queen Story
1698880	1704240	Hour is teaching kids to become friendly to. That's what they mean by family friendly but they want
1704240	1709200	you to think it means that yeah adults and parents and little kids and their grandparents are all
1709200	1714320	welcome to come watch. The paper in fact repeatedly invokes the concept of a drag family for the kids
1714320	1720480	that they would you know obviously latch on to in order to develop their queer aspects of themselves
1720480	1724800	and then the last sentence of the paper the last half of that sentence anyway is
1724800	1729280	we'll leave a trail of glitter that will never come out of the carpet. Well what's the carpet
1729280	1735360	here seems like it's probably children's minds doesn't seem like that's on the up and up now
1735360	1739200	remember that I'm going to read the actual full quote I've just talked about it. Let me read the
1739200	1743280	real quote to you the real paragraph and the question is what word am I supposed to use for
1743280	1747920	this because I'm not supposed to call it grooming okay so here's a full the full quote of that family
1747920	1752960	friendly part so you don't think I'm lying even though I did a podcast about it before queer
1752960	1758320	world making including political organizing has long been a project driven by desire that's what I
1758320	1764960	said earlier it isn't part enacted through art sorry it enacted through art forms like fashion
1764960	1770800	theater and drag so queer world making is enacted through art forms like fashion theater and drag
1770800	1776320	notice it's not math or physics or history we believe that drag queen story hour offers an
1776320	1782480	invitation toward deeper public engagement with queer cultural production particularly for young
1782480	1787360	children and their families this one of those times where I want to have like digital slowdown
1787360	1796720	particularly for young children and their families particularly for young children
1796720	1803120	do you get the point particularly for young children it may be that drag queen story hour is
1803120	1808000	quote family friendly in the sense that it is accessible and inviting to families with children
1808000	1815280	that's what we call the mod but it is less a sanitizing force than it is a preparatory introduction
1815280	1823840	to alternate modes of kinship period that's the bailey here drag queen story hour is quote family
1823840	1830720	friendly in the sense of quote family as an old school queer code to identify and connect with
1830720	1840720	other queers on the street so I'm asking I can't use the word groomer what word am I supposed to
1840720	1850160	use for that I know which word I can't use and that puts me at a complete loss but what I have
1850160	1857680	actually described to you isn't just drag queen story hour it is queer pedagogy it is queer education
1857680	1864400	it is the installing of queer theory into children by means of the educational system and
1864400	1870400	educational methodologies both in terms of curriculum and in terms of teaching methods
1871920	1878960	so here's how queer theory works you can't describe it you can't say anything about it
1879520	1886480	unless you support it because otherwise you were applying power to it you were being unjust you were
1886480	1895200	doing anti-lgbtq hate you didn't engage properly because if you engaged properly that means that you
1895200	1901680	took on the worldview and agreed with it you can't even talk about queer theory according to queer
1901680	1908400	theorists unless you support it it is just like a cult one that targets kids as we can clearly see
1908400	1914400	one that is based in sex and one that doesn't have a lot to do with gay people remember if you
1914400	1920240	criticize queer theory that's anti-lgbtq hate you will end up with a profile if you're
1920960	1925840	high enough profile individual such as myself on the southern poverty law center accusing you of
1925840	1932720	anti-lgbtq hate of hate speech of malice of all these things you'll get accused of homophobia
1932720	1939120	transphobia and the famous term is anti-lgbtq hate I'm going to keep coming back to that because
1939120	1944320	there's so many things out there claiming that people such as me and others engage in anti-lgbtq
1945120	1955440	hate all you have to do to engage in anti-lgbtq hate is read queer theory out loud word for word
1955440	1961920	as it is written by queer theorists themselves and say that's bad so there's a rumor widely
1961920	1967280	printed about me that I because of my use of the word groomer to describe what we just talked about
1967280	1972080	implicates me in some social crime called anti-lgbtq hate which is apparently very bad very serious
1972080	1977840	and early toxic even though all it means is not agreeing with queer theory it's not just harmful
1977840	1983600	rhetoric it's in fact also a conspiracy theory they say and I am not just a very bad person
1983600	1990720	which obviously I must be but also a very crazy person for naming the obvious not as a result of
1990720	1996720	inference not as a result of guesswork not as a result of any emotions that I have but literally
1996800	2004480	just by reading out loud and saying exactly what their own proudly printed writings say
2006000	2011840	without any need to embellish without any need to interpret I just tell you what it says and say
2012400	2018480	by the way they mean it when they say the empathy is a marketing trope and family friendly is a
2018480	2024560	marketing trope but they really mean something else that there is a Mott and Bailey rhetorical
2024560	2032400	strategy in play here I'm not in Bailey actual dialectical lie here all I'm doing you is telling
2032400	2040880	you what they've written making taking some of the veneer off of it and now I am a conspiracy
2040880	2048160	theorist I am a hater I have a southern poverty law center article and a profile written up about
2048160	2051360	me do you think well who cares that's like a badge of honor and I take it that way obviously
2051360	2055840	that's why I called myself general hate but stop for two seconds and realize
2056720	2061200	that if I get called to do some professional thing that's going to get brought up as a reason
2061200	2065920	why I'm not supposed to be there if I try to give a talk and protesters try to get a shutdown
2065920	2071440	they're going to leverage that against some wavering or even complicit institutional
2071440	2078160	administration to keep me out they know how this works the accusation and the resulting
2078160	2083600	social dynamic which is always hostile is straight out of Maoism it's straight out of Maoist China
2083600	2090400	from the 1950s and 60s I have been alleged to be engaging in a crime called anti LGBTQ hate
2091120	2096720	and the right side of history and right side of society which are on the right side of history
2096720	2103680	are called to judge me bully me hold me to account for that crime by whatever means it can manage
2103680	2108960	the bullying is to continue until I learn to recognize my crime from the queer position
2110240	2116320	in other words I adopted the positionality of queer theory and see how what I said or what I did
2116320	2122160	was actually socially criminal and I pledged to reform my thought by adopting queer theory
2122160	2126720	so that I can not only do better but also become an activist on behalf of queer theory it's a life
2126720	2135280	long commitment to self reflection self critique and social activism this is identical to the
2135280	2141680	thought reform programs of Mao's China it's just a slightly different ideology of course their
2141680	2146320	accusation is absolute nonsense but that's not the point the point is to initiate the social
2146320	2151360	struggle session on me in order to transform my views to ones that are either at least empathetic
2151360	2158960	to or ideally that embrace and repeat queer theory the accusation is of an old Marxist standard
2158960	2164240	form truth married to a lie and here's the truth gays and lesbians fought for decades to break the
2164240	2169360	public perception that they are predators and groomers of children but here's the lie that's
2169360	2174320	who and what I'm talking about when I criticize their theory and activism in other words I'm not
2174320	2180560	talking about gay people just like Halpern's not talking about gay people unlike gay identity
2180560	2185520	I'm talking about people who are deliberately engaging in the ideological and maybe worse
2186720	2191840	transformation of children into a queer political identity that's who I'm talking about
2191840	2196800	but the the the lie is that I'm talking about gays and lesbians or maybe trans people at large
2197520	2202560	when I criticize their own theory and activism and point out that what they say in their own words
2203760	2209680	needs a word it sounds seems very groomery even if I can't say groomer about it and we're all not
2209680	2214000	supposed to of course we can say that and we do say that and it's not hate to point it out it's
2214000	2222320	right there in black and white but this has nothing to do with any of that the truth is that queer
2222320	2226880	used to be a slur for gay people so the activists took it on to describe themselves in defiance
2227520	2232480	of prejudice and bigotry but also because it now becomes impossible to talk about it oh queer
2232480	2238480	theory you're using a slur there's there's a there's a situation the lie is that queer theory
2238480	2243280	ever represented civil rights movements for anyone or gay people in particular in fact it was the
2243280	2248640	opposite it was against everything that the gay civil rights movement was about queer theory is a
2248640	2253600	destructive form of radical activism because it's a marxist theory so there has to be activism
2253600	2258800	connected it's not just a theory it's theory and practice combined and it is a destructive form of
2258800	2263920	radical activism that actually historically opposed gay civil rights inequality well why in the world
2263920	2269520	would it do that aren't they the same thing no of course not because gay equality and gay acceptance
2269520	2276640	would normalize being gay within society and would legitimize normalcy and legitimacy right
2276640	2282560	legitimize gay people as fully equal members of society queer theory is by definition radically
2282560	2287760	opposed on principle to anything normal and legitimate they even have a word for what would
2287760	2294720	happen if we had gay equality and gay acceptance homonormativity which is society accepting
2294720	2300320	gay as being part of the normal expression of what it means to be human sometimes and that would
2300320	2305360	mean it's within the normative framework now and the gay people are expected to okay you're great
2305360	2310720	you're gay so what great get a put on a suit and get a job and that would all be very bad because
2310720	2315840	they're no longer radical activists gay activists who are listening to this from the 1990s can readily
2315840	2320400	back me up on this they'll readily attest that the queer activists were often strongly opposed to
2320400	2327040	their ambitions for civil and legal equality for marriage and for social acceptance they just were
2327040	2332480	why because they wanted radicals queer theory needs radical activists not stable citizens who can go
2332480	2337840	about their lives in a society that doesn't in any way meaningfully discriminate against them
2337840	2342320	they need there to be discrimination or the appearance of hate or the the fear that there
2342320	2348800	will be the bad old times coming back in order to radicalize those people into revolutionary activity
2349760	2353120	or just to show up and be human shields for the queer theorists who are doing that
2355360	2358800	the civil rights activists and the gay civil rights movements in the
2359520	2366880	80s 90s and so on fought hard for decades to over starting at least in the 50s to overcome
2366880	2370800	stereotypes of predatory behavior and the idea that they're intrinsically groomers
2370800	2376720	and that's why the queer theorists actually claim that or that's why they're actually able to claim
2376720	2384000	that calling out their blatant grooming is anti lgbt lgbtq they're saying look
2385200	2390880	50 60 years ago 30 years ago people said that all gay gay people are groomers and gay rights just
2390880	2396560	enables groomers and the gays the gay civil rights leaders fought back and said no that is not what
2396560	2403120	we're about that is nothing to do with who we are that is a harmful stereotype and they won we
2403120	2408400	trusted them and now you have these freaks and weirdos who are queer theorists who were never
2408400	2414880	particularly interested in civil rights at all who are saying if you call them which is the
2414880	2422320	narrower narrower subset the q not even all the rest of it if you call the q groomers then what
2422320	2428800	you are doing is anti lgbtq hate you see how the acronym works to create human shields
2430160	2440560	do you understand that l lesbian g gay b bisexual t trans q queer all different all different
2440560	2444560	lesbians are women who are attracted to women by the way you have to know what a woman is to make
2444560	2449280	that work gays are men who are attracted to men you have to know what men are to make that work
2449280	2454640	bisexuals are people who are attracted to men and women by two so you have to believe in the
2454640	2462640	binary to make that work trans people it's its own complicated topic but they are men or women
2462640	2468400	who do not recognize themselves as men or women and in fact may actually recognize themselves
2468400	2475520	as the opposite so something's very different there and then q is queer and we already heard
2475520	2478720	that queer has nothing to do with any of that because queer is a radical political stance
2479760	2487200	but if you criticize queer you get wrapped up in anti lgbtq hate when you're not engaging in
2488080	2498160	any anti lgb or maybe even sometimes t activity thought or anything at all it's super fake it's
2498160	2506880	a standard trick that these kind of gnostic cults do another example is the christian nationalist
2506880	2512720	movement does the exact same trick for example if you criticize christian nationalism and you happen
2512720	2518160	not to be a christian ask me how i know what they will say is james is attacking christians no i'm
2518160	2523840	not i'm attacking lunatics who are hiding behind the christian identity and brand same thing with
2523840	2530320	feminists if you do maybe ask me how i know again maybe you call radical feminists hags i don't know
2530320	2533360	why you would do that you'd say they're a bunch of man hating hags maybe you would say that about
2533360	2537840	radical feminists for some reason or another maybe nobody could know why you would say that but maybe
2537840	2542880	you say that maybe you're tempted to say that and you say that and they'll say you're attacking women
2543520	2548960	no you're not attacking women you're talk you're attacking radical feminist hags it's very clear
2548960	2552640	who you're actually talking about and they don't get to represent all women it's very much like
2552640	2557200	when donald trump is one of my favorite donald trump incidents was in an interview with one of
2557200	2561040	these hags probably katie kerrick or something like that i don't remember the details what he was
2561040	2564640	in this interview and they said well what about when you called women hags and luckily he knew what
2564640	2569840	the hell they were no pigs what about when you called women pigs and uh donald trump luckily
2569840	2573760	knew what the hell they were talking about he said i didn't call women pigs i called rosy o donal a pig
2574320	2580000	which is hilarious because that's actually what's happening and of course i'm i'm way off script here
2580000	2586720	but this is generally what they do they blend contexts that are not the same together and treat
2586720	2592000	them as though they're the same radical feminists might be women but they are not representative
2592000	2596320	of all women no matter how much they think that they get to be the gnostic representatives
2596320	2602000	of true womanhood they don't get to do that so if you criticize the specific group say radical
2602000	2609600	feminists or christian nationalists or queer theorists or whatever they hide behind the general
2609600	2615840	group by claiming to be the true representatives of that thing they're blending together the context
2615840	2622080	of the specific their group with the general or the whole which they actually are a part of
2622080	2630880	yes it's true when i criticize um radical feminists who happen to be women that i am
2630880	2636880	criticizing some women but i'm not criticizing women as i don't even like to think of women
2636880	2643680	as a class i'm criticizing particular women just like rosy o donal when i criticize
2645760	2652000	queer theorists i'm not criticizing lgbtq because lgbtq doesn't even exist that's that's a
2652960	2658080	manufactured synthetic coalition so that queer theorists can hide behind other people who are
2658080	2662240	sympathetic characters when i criticize christian nationalists it doesn't really matter they call
2662240	2670160	themselves christian but they're obviously not so whatever what's happening is that the fact is
2670160	2676000	that queer activism explicitly as we've described it so far puts the appearance of glaring truth back
2676000	2681680	into the stereotypes of groomers and then when you call them out for it they get mad and hide behind
2681680	2689600	gay people and say see they're attacking you all you gay people see the conservatives everybody
2689600	2695120	the society hates gay people and everyday gay people who are good citizens lose the most from
2695120	2700000	this little trick because eventually things start to break down and the queer activists gain the
2700000	2704480	most because they end up with a larger pool of radicalism they end up with more contention and
2704480	2710960	division in society and they end up with more instability in society queer activism is therefore
2710960	2720080	a strictly parasitic behavior like any cult activity but about grooming more specifically i
2720080	2725680	am talking not even necessarily about the thing that they are accusing me of i'm not when i say
2725680	2731440	that ant that this is grooming i'm not actually talking about the sexual grooming that they try
2731440	2736960	to pretend this is them again blending context i am grooming talking about grooming specifically
2736960	2741840	into a cult ideology called queer theory i've been very clear about this over and over again you
2741840	2746480	can look the word up type in the word grooming and see what it means yes there is the idea of sexual
2746480	2752000	grooming and oh there it is ideological or political or whatever other professional grooming
2753360	2758720	but just to really drive home that they are doing ideological grooming like it's not already clear
2758720	2764480	let's direct our attention to another scholar another queer educator kevin commissaro who wrote
2764480	2770480	a paper in 2002 called against repetition and i remind you against repetition means against the
2770480	2776800	repetition of the existing society by teaching kids to be queer activists anyway in that paper he
2776800	2783040	describes the purpose of queer education for children and commissaro explicitly says that
2783040	2789920	teaching children about social justice including about ideas from queer theory is meant to induce in
2789920	2796720	fact it is the obligation of the teacher to do this to induce an emotional and identity based
2796720	2803680	crisis in them he then says that's why it's so important to have queer educators in place
2803680	2809040	who can guide the the now vulnerable students who are experiencing emotional crisis so that
2809040	2814960	those crises are resolved in favor of social justice and queer theory here are some relevant
2814960	2820320	quotes from the paper from pages 74 and 75 he says repeating what is already learned can be
2820320	2824480	comforting and therefore desirable students learning things that question their knowledge
2825040	2831600	and identities on the other hand can be emotionally upsetting for example suppose students think
2831600	2837680	society is meritocratic but learn that it is racist raise your hand if you're sick of this
2837680	2843680	shit or think that they themselves are not contributing to homophobia but learn that they
2843680	2850720	in fact are raise your hand if you're sick of this shit in such situations students learn that the
2850720	2857280	ways that they think and act are not only limited but also oppressive learning about oppression
2857280	2862880	and about the ways they often unknowingly comply with oppression can lead students to feel
2864080	2870320	paralyzed with anger sadness anxiety and guilt it can lead to a form of emotional crisis
2871040	2876320	they think this is an educational mandate this is what the point of education is and then he says
2876320	2881760	once in a crisis students can go in many directions some that may lead to anti oppressive change
2881760	2888160	others that may lead to a more entrenched resistance therefore educators have a responsibility not
2888160	2893280	only to draw students into a possible crisis but also to structure experiences that can help
2893280	2899840	them work through their crises productively let's just pause for a second educators have a
2899840	2907520	responsibility to draw students into possible crisis that's a real sentence and then they also
2907520	2911520	are meant to structure the environment and experiences around the student to get them
2911520	2918560	to go in a particular direction that's cult indoctrination it's knowingly willfully and
2918560	2924480	deliberately cult indoctrination but other scholars in the same domains confirm this for us
2924560	2930880	there's another paper in 2019 two scholars torres and fairy they say it explicitly
2932480	2937520	in a paper called not everyone gets a seat at the table they say it explicitly that this is
2937520	2942320	what their model of education represents that it's in and i mean it that it's indoctrination
2942320	2947520	here's how they said it for all the criticism teachers receive for quote indoctrinating
2947520	2952480	students turning them into liberal minded cry babies not much has been said in defense
2952480	2958880	at the very least a shy denial is made it is time for educators to own this criticism and admit
2958880	2964560	that is exactly what we do there it is in black and white on page 33 of not everyone gets a seat
2964560	2969760	at the table you can read these quotes in the querying of the american child where logan lansing
2970560	2976880	put them he found these these quotes actually i did not but what kevin kumashiro is describing
2976880	2981440	is actually worse than the indoctrination that torres and fairy are talking about saying that
2981440	2987920	that's exactly what they do a cycle of inducing crisis and then resolving it toward a particular
2987920	2994240	doctrine isn't indoctrination it's trauma bonding that's a practice of ideological
2994240	3002720	transformation or thought reform or brainwashing or cult grooming so it can be pretty plainly said
3002720	3007120	queer theory practices thought reform and it practices thought reform because queer theory
3007120	3011840	is the doctrine of a religious cult we already see that that cult is based on sex and that it
3011840	3016000	primarily targets children and that it has little or nothing to do with with being gay
3016000	3023520	so that pretty much lays out my primary thesis that's what queer theory is now of course fine it's
3023520	3029840	a cult what now well nobody joins a cult to join a cult so do you want to have in mind that the
3029840	3034320	people in it don't know it's a cult and in fact they may not even know that they are subscribed
3034400	3038000	to queer theory or that queer theory is a critical constructivist ideology of sex
3038000	3042400	gender and sexuality they probably don't know those things as a matter of fact
3043360	3047680	but people don't the point is people don't join a cult to go find a cult and join it nobody says
3047680	3050880	in the morning hey i'm going to get up and go find a cult and join a cult because i don't have
3050880	3056640	anything better to do people join a cult because they are suffering in some way and the cult comes
3056640	3063120	in parasitically and offers them some false resolution to their suffering it seems like
3063120	3068080	something that will get them out of loneliness out of spiritual malaise out of vulnerability of
3068080	3074080	some kind virtually everyone who has ever escaped a cult tells this same story they wanted to belong
3074080	3078160	they wanted a social circle they wanted to understanding they wanted purpose in life they
3078160	3085920	wanted something to do the cult preys upon these people and slowly locks them in one of the tools
3085920	3092080	they use is trauma bonding one of the tools they use is separating people from their their family
3092080	3098880	and friends what's trauma bonding though that sounds bad besides what Kevin Kumashuro says
3098880	3103440	is the point of queer education or education for social justice trauma bonding is as harmful
3103440	3110000	and manipulative as it sounds it is the technique of cult initiation i should say and abuse it's
3110000	3116080	basically like hazing the basic formula is really simple first you traumatize your targets until you've
3116080	3120560	harmed them enough for the process to work and then you celebrate them when you do it when they
3120560	3125280	do what you want and you don't celebrate them or even punish them more when they do what you don't
3125280	3131280	want that's it they will bond with the people traumatizing them because of the rewards they
3131280	3137840	get when the trauma is the traumatic experience is is lightened up this is what robert lifton in
3137840	3143440	thought reform in the psychology of totalism refers to as an alternating cycle of harshness
3143440	3150080	and leniency and that's key to how cult bonding works or thought reform works as a matter of fact
3150080	3155280	which is basically the same thing so in queer theory what you do is you take people particularly
3155280	3160320	kids and you tell them the world isn't at all the way that it seems and in fact neither are they
3160320	3164320	and it isn't the way that they've been led to believe if they're different it's because they're
3164320	3169440	oppressed if they feel uncomfortable it's because society doesn't like people like them they're
3169440	3173200	probably different than they've always been told maybe they've been lied to about themselves
3173200	3178160	they've certainly been lied to about other people and how society should be and it's been
3178160	3183600	holding them back and making them feel bad and maybe instead it's well maybe you're not in that
3183600	3188320	category but the way you act hurts other people you're hurting people that's what kevin kumashiro
3188320	3193600	actually said now if you're interested in exploring further even though you're young you should you
3193600	3199040	should explore these feelings these guilt anxiety anger sadness weren't those the ones he talked about
3199040	3203840	discomfort with your body discomfort with your sexuality discomfort with your social environment
3203840	3207840	discomfort with your parents if you're uncomfortable with any of this for any reason
3208400	3214320	maybe your body is wrong maybe your family is wrong maybe there's somebody else who you who
3214320	3219120	is who you really are that you don't know about in society just doesn't want you to be who they
3219120	3223120	that person is your parents don't want you to be that person either and if they're parent if your
3223120	3228480	parents disagree maybe they're going to disagree maybe they shouldn't be included in these decisions
3228480	3234560	maybe you need to trust a trusted adult instead maybe you need a school counselor maybe you need
3234560	3238720	the faculty member in charge of the gay straight alliance maybe you need a teacher who has the
3238720	3244080	flag up that represents that they're a safe space and that they won't tell on you maybe you need
3244080	3251440	a queer family queer theory is then offered as the lens that resolves all the resulting confusion
3251440	3259920	shock dissonance pain guilt anxiety sadness anger and vulnerability that's how this works
3259920	3263920	and then what happens next is that you affirm and celebrate them when they show interest
3263920	3268880	if they get interested in this think oh yeah maybe that's right maybe I am different maybe
3268880	3274080	there maybe society's not free maybe my parents wouldn't like me thinking this or doing this maybe
3274080	3279520	I was made wrong maybe I'm in the wrong body maybe I'm in the wrong family then you celebrate them
3279520	3284800	you lead them to believe that they're making brave decisions that are worthy of interest
3284800	3290640	and respect you coerce them and their social groups to participate in this ritual of affirmation
3291280	3295760	and tacitly threaten anyone who doesn't want to go along with it or maybe not even tacitly maybe
3295760	3298880	you talk about how not inclusive they are and how they're part of the problem and how they're
3298880	3306000	hurting people's feelings you make the people who are taking the path feel like they belong
3306000	3310080	and that they just for being who they are are special and have a special purpose in the world
3310080	3315040	to fulfill to change the world to transform the world to make it more accepting of people like
3315040	3320480	them who don't get to feel that way or others that they know their friends you teach them special
3320480	3325600	words that describe the very small but growing number of people who identify just like they do
3325600	3330880	outside of the norm outside of what society and their parents consider legitimate this is the
3330880	3336160	trauma bonding process of queer theory in particular in schools this is also called programming
3336160	3341680	or grooming and it takes predictable paths the first thing it does is it leads people
3341680	3346080	into emotional vulnerability that's what Kevin Kumashiro said what I just described by the way
3346080	3350160	was it lead them into emotional crisis and then structure their experiences so they resolve those
3350160	3354640	crises in the direction you want them to go in that's all I described but it leads people into
3355120	3363600	this emotional vulnerability and into a kind of a path is offered to resolution and that generates
3363600	3368320	personal and social interest which is followed up by psychological and social commitment they don't
3368320	3373440	want to let the people down that they've so far impressed they want to keep feeling brave and
3374000	3379040	unique and different and special so they get a psychological commitment but also a social
3379040	3382000	commitment these people have invested in them these people care about them these people are
3382000	3385840	supporting them and affirming them in their journeys and you're going to let them down if
3385840	3391040	you just bail out and think maybe it's not for you this is then deepened into an increasingly deep
3391040	3398320	social and emotional commitment to the cult that's achieved largely through repeated cycles of
3398320	3404960	trauma bonding techniques that's how they do this that's what it means to lead people into crisis
3404960	3411440	and structure their environment so that the crisis resolves in the desired direction this process
3411440	3418000	creates emotionally and socially bonded members who populate the wide majority of any cult membership
3418800	3423360	those who are socially and emotionally locked in without necessarily understanding the doctrine
3423360	3426800	they don't have to know a word of queer theory they don't have to know queer theory exists they
3426800	3433760	don't have to know anything all they have to do is feel like they belong in the cult and feel like
3433760	3440640	they don't belong in the world anymore they don't need anything more than that I've called this in
3440640	3446000	the past talking about the structure of cults the outer school of the cult the social psychological
3446000	3452640	and emotional cues are then steadily deepened over time through processes of increasing exposure
3452640	3458880	to doctrine by processes of increasing exposure to trauma bonding by having them facilitate the
3458880	3464960	same process on someone else who's newer in the path so that they get more and more committed to it
3464960	3476080	the feelings the themes increasingly focus on guilt shame isolation alienation confusion
3478400	3483760	at least on the one hand but meanwhile they're also talking about a horizon of potentiality
3483760	3491760	in other words hope excitement inclusion belonging on the other shunning people who act like haters
3491760	3497200	that's why it's called anti lgbtq hate to disagree with them shunning haters who don't support and
3497200	3503760	affirm them even if it's their own families is also increased over time to make sure the cult
3503760	3510160	environment is the predominant influence in the victims lives that's what structuring the environment
3510160	3518400	looks like as this process is repeated this is brainwashing it is thought reform it is not education
3519120	3526720	when the in fact it's child abuse and it's happening at scale by demand in virtually every
3526720	3532800	school system in the united states and in canada where it's actually worse what happens when these
3532800	3538160	kids get committed enough to the cult when their emotional and social connection is so deep that
3538160	3543760	they're that's who they are now that's who they know themselves to be in terms in terms of what's
3543840	3548880	in terms of what's called psychosocial valuation well when the commitment is high enough a process
3548880	3554720	of study begins that's when they're going to get introduced to the actual doctrine the more
3554720	3560400	committed outer school members will start to learn the doctrine of the cult here they'd be
3560400	3566480	studying queer theory in mal's prisons they would be studying Marxism and Leninism and socialism
3567360	3572560	they're not just learning how to use pronouns or discover new ones they're not learning how to
3572560	3576720	present themselves how to denounce everything against queer theory how to shut people out of
3576720	3581280	their lives for disagreeing what the cult thinks is good for supporting people who are going through
3581280	3587680	this process affirming blah blah blah cancels what's what's against them and affirm what is for them
3587680	3592320	they're not just doing that they're also learning to defend that with pseudo-intellectual arguments
3592880	3598960	based in queer theory they're learning to do a lot of queer activism which deepens their commitment
3598960	3604000	every time you act on behalf of a set of beliefs you become more committed to those beliefs every
3604000	3611120	time you act in a commitment to a group you become more committed to the group why would you be doing
3611120	3616560	any of this stuff which is unpopular and difficult i might even involve scary stuff like surgeries
3616560	3621520	or standing up to your parents or throwing at your parents under the bus when you could be doing
3621520	3627200	other things better things easier things unless you are really committed that's the psychology
3627680	3632560	here and these people who are socially and emotionally dependent on a cult that has groomed
3632560	3638240	them to be that way are then led to become intellectually committed to it and they form
3638240	3643680	not an outer school of the cult but an inner school they are what we might call adapts not initiates
3645680	3650960	most of the scholars the community organizers and the queer theory cult are in this tier most of
3650960	3656000	the teachers that visit this upon kids by the way are not they're caught up in the outer school
3656080	3660000	themselves they don't know the doctrine they don't they may not even like it they're just stuck
3660000	3664560	having to do it or going along with a current or they're just caught up by empathy which is we
3664560	3672400	already heard a lie to push it on to people just in case the activists the consultants they definitely
3672400	3678400	are the scholars they definitely are they know what they're doing there's another tier beyond this
3678400	3683120	of course the so-called inner circle to cults members of the inner circle of a cult direct the
3683120	3688960	cult and profit from the cult they might or might not believe in its doctrine depending on their
3688960	3693600	motivations with queer theory undoubtedly some of the biggest organizers and financiers of the
3693600	3699440	movement which primarily targets our children do not believe in it itself but fully believe in its
3699440	3706720	destructive and disruptive potential on our society and our kids others do believe in the
3706720	3711120	enormous amount of profit that's available from destroying lives and turning them into a permanent
3711120	3720240	complicated medical or psychiatric patient others see political utility i don't think it's likely
3720240	3726000	that much of the biden administration really believes queer theory but they see it as a political tool
3727120	3732640	and they also see its capacity to build a permanently disaffected group with partially
3732640	3737440	legitimate demands that will make for the rest of their lives against a system they hate that they
3737440	3743520	can then pander to others see getting millions of people to participate in the cult and its affirmations
3743520	3748640	is the way to affirm themselves and their own journeys think of the kind of big trans billionaires
3748640	3755120	martin rothblatt the pritzkers and so on they shovel money into it so lots of kids will become
3755120	3761040	trans so that society accepts trans so the society accepts them and that they were a trailblazer who
3761040	3768080	made it happen that's their journey and it has to be affirmed so then they just happen to have
3768080	3772400	billions of dollars to finance campaigns for mass affirmation there are lots of reasons why people
3772400	3777680	at that tier of the cult might be involved and it's not always that they fully believe in it though
3777680	3783600	it can sometimes be that the most important thing to remember about these different tiers of cults
3783600	3790240	and the basic structure of cults and the guiding principles behind each is just that they exist
3790240	3794240	that's the most important thing to realize the outer school are initiates they're seeking
3795040	3801600	psychological and social reward through the cults manipulative offerings they're overwhelmingly the
3801600	3807040	majority of the captured cultists the inner school seeks the same thing but more they have
3807040	3813280	existential fervor tied to it in some degree that increases over time of intellectual immoral superiority
3813280	3818480	because they know the doctrine the inner circle may or may not even know the doctrine they usually
3818480	3823520	do but they don't always tends to be small in number and is ultimately using the whole cult
3823520	3827520	to whatever its twisted purposes are which may not agree with one another in a case like this
3828080	3832080	in the case of marxist cults the inner circle always uses the revolutionary cult of the era
3832080	3836080	and then disposes of it when it's time to move on to the next phase of the revolution
3836080	3840240	and i don't think that we should see anything different i think that these destabilizers
3840240	3846000	that we see in queer activism are likely to be disposed of when they become a liability if the
3846000	3849680	revolution succeeds but they're really useful for tearing apart the society we have now
3850480	3854880	by tearing apart families and children's lives and so much else
3856480	3860800	so a little more on the environment about cults though because i think it's important to understand
3860800	3865760	the environment in which cults transform their victims needs to be kind of looked at
3865760	3869680	and nobody's done it in greater depth than robert lyfton robert j lyfton who studied the
3869680	3877440	Maoist cult in detail as it was happening in the 1950s and he asserts that cults effectively take
3877440	3883360	advantage of up to eight qualities that allows them to do thought reform on their populations
3884160	3888560	queer theory as you'll see very obviously utilizes all eight of these and does so in
3888560	3895440	sophisticated ways and so i'll talk about each one of these eight very briefly first there's
3895520	3900640	melu control cults control the environment and make sure it only reflects cult doctrine
3900640	3905440	this is why they cut people off from their friends or families uh any outside information
3905440	3909760	and views that's all problematic it's harmful it's hurtful it's hate you can't look at it don't
3909760	3915520	listen to james lindsay's podcast he's a hater he's lgbtq hate it's just gonna hurt your feelings
3915520	3921680	it's so much transphobia you won't be able to stand it they keep you isolated in your melu from
3921680	3927440	anything that might challenge or or break you free of cult doctrine so by the way if you happen
3927440	3931200	to be imbibed in queer theory or you're kind of a queer theorist or you think you have a queer
3931200	3935680	identity and you happen to be listening to this you're in a fucking cult now i'm just let me tell
3935680	3940320	you just bluntly i use the bad word not because i lack words not because i'm missing vocabulary
3940320	3945600	but to get your attention you are in a fucking cult and you are gonna you need to wake up it will
3945600	3951280	your life will get better from the day you start getting away from this but anyway the melu control
3951280	3956720	is all about like in our our world what we see is that it's using inclusion policies to ensure
3956720	3962560	institutions and people only present cult agreeable views and affirmation and they remove anything
3962560	3967040	that might cause doubt to the cult including people materials and so on aka cancel culture
3968240	3972640	it is the immersive media and messaging that we get from all levels entertainment school
3973680	3979520	politicians everything once you have melu control second lyfton says that you can then engage in
3979520	3984560	something he calls mystical manipulation and i did a short bullet point episode of the podcast
3984560	3992560	recently about that called plan spontaneity the lie of plan spontaneity cults he says create an
3992560	3999520	appearance of total agreement mostly by silencing all disagreement and a sense of inevitability
3999520	4002960	you might hear it kind of phrase this way there's a change coming and there's nothing you can do
4002960	4006560	about it but you want to get on the right side of it because things will be good for you you might
4006560	4011680	also hear it is who's on the right side of history there's a sense of total agreement all of society
4011680	4017200	is going this way in inevitability history is moving this way there's also planned spontaneity
4017760	4023600	which is organized protests and activism and activities that are made to look like they were
4023600	4027840	spontaneous and organic because that gives the impression that the people are motivated to
4027840	4032320	bring this into being and it also gives a sense of higher purpose like being on the right side of
4032320	4038480	history and the point of mystical manipulation by a cult is in order to convince the victims
4039120	4046560	of their power and influence the inevitability the total agreement of society it's just happening
4046560	4053600	look there's so many people involved and they're working toward a better future it makes the
4053600	4060080	cult appear more right and righteous to those captured by its spells think of the film the
4060080	4064480	Truman show Jim character and Jim Carrey's character Truman was at the center of a huge
4064480	4069680	operation of mystical manipulation if you want to understand what that looks like that was a totally
4069680	4076320	controlled milieu third Lyfton says that within cult environments there is a demand for purity
4076320	4080720	actually he says within ideological totalist environments which is to say cult environments
4080720	4086240	there's a demand for purity cults are virtually always puritanical in their value systems they
4086320	4091600	present their victims with stark contrasts of good and evil of right and wrong on virtually every
4091600	4096400	issue and they demand purity with being on the right side of every issue and in fact they leverage
4096400	4101360	that because you can't be you can't be perfectly pure so you keep this constant wheel of shame
4101360	4106000	turning inside of you of guilt and shame and then you use that to pressure other people into
4106000	4110400	better compliance to cover up for your failures so that it's not you getting called out it's them
4110400	4117200	instead first these dynamics manifest in dichotomies like pure versus impure absolutely good versus
4117200	4122800	absolutely evil sacred versus profane or specifically in social justice cults like queer theory
4122800	4131840	affirmation versus existential denial or care versus hate they're also interested at cults are if
4131840	4136080	not obsessed with the binary of queer theory in particular with the binary of innocence versus
4136080	4142960	initiation to various levels of standing within the cult including inclusion within the cult itself
4142960	4148240	in the extreme this demand for purity sets up a dichotomy as stark as the people versus the enemies
4148240	4153440	of the people the people support queer theory the enemies of the people are anti lgbtq hate who
4153440	4161120	must be destroyed in the name of the queer people fourth he lists or he mentions what he calls a
4161120	4167280	cult of confession that's based off of the demand for purity the demand for purity leads the cults
4167280	4173360	victims to readily identify how they fall short of cult perfection leading them to both fear and
4173360	4180240	desire to confess their failures and their evil ways that's the whole program confess recognize
4180240	4185840	your crimes you have to confess look at the three body problem scene look at these other scenes of
4185840	4190240	the cultural revolution that keep going viral now that people can kind of open their eyes and see
4190240	4196320	what's happening that's what it's about a cult of confession confess how you are transphobic confess
4196320	4201280	how you contribute to homophobia confess how you could do better cults often encourage this behavior
4201280	4206000	to facilitate the trauma bonding process but they also do it to get you to recognize cult doctrine
4206000	4212320	and its application to your own life and situation and what paul frady calls your own existential
4212320	4218800	situation the trauma bonding wheel of pain it's turned through pressuring people to confess say
4218800	4224000	to homophobia or transphobia being a made up gender a made up sexuality or whatever and then
4224000	4230880	rewarding them what they do and punishing those that get accused of you know not being on board
4231600	4236960	only later after they they say you know they after they do what they're supposed to do later you
4236960	4242320	that it's a wheel of pain as I said you later indicate that their confession wasn't sufficient
4242320	4246640	or sincere enough and you pull up some little detail where they fell short to point out that
4246640	4251200	they didn't really mean it they're not really on board they still have internalized transphobia
4251200	4258000	or whatever to initiate another round of struggle the melu control and demand for purity come together
4258000	4262720	to create a uniquely exquisite psychological environment lyftons very clear about this
4262720	4267760	in this environment almost everyone believes everyone else is pure while they themselves are
4267760	4275680	not by the way if you search I actually did do a podcast about this chapter of lyfton specifically
4275680	4280480	where I read I think the whole thing if not very close to it so you can go listen to lyftons full
4280480	4285520	exposes exposition on this on new discourses and another podcast I'll think of the title
4285520	4290240	scenario later but if you search go to the search bar and type in lyfton you can figure out which
4290240	4298080	podcast is lyftons and I read the entire chapter of his book for for this topic but anyway sorry
4298080	4302400	this is I was talking about the unique psychological environment an exquisite psychological environment
4302400	4307360	created by melu control and demand for purity so you're in a completely controlled environment
4307360	4313440	and your purity demands are high and you're being manipulated all the time mystical manipulation
4313440	4318000	and what it results in is that almost everyone believes that everyone else is pure while they
4318000	4324240	themselves are not think about that everyone you look around at is somehow a saint because
4324240	4328320	everybody else got cancelled and thrown out by the way everyone else is a saint of the ideology
4328320	4333120	but you nobody will tell how they are secretly transphobic nobody will come up it's like the
4333120	4340080	time I had this young woman come up to me and the friend of the family and she came up and
4340080	4343920	asked if she could talk to me because she knows my stance on these things and she said I want to
4343920	4347360	talk to you because I know I can can tell you this and I have something I have to say and I was
4347360	4351200	like what is it and she said I'm just done with the pronoun thing and she started crying because
4351200	4354000	she didn't have anybody she could tell she was done with the pronoun thing she thought the pronoun
4354000	4359200	thing was ridiculous so she knew she had this inner sin against the trans doctrine or the
4359200	4365840	queer theory doctrine that the pronoun rituals ridiculous and it's just demanding and it's
4365840	4370160	compelled speech but she didn't feel like she could tell anybody that so she thought she alone
4370160	4376160	among her she came to me to tell me because she thought she alone alone in the world completely
4376160	4382880	isolated felt that way and she had to find some forbidden outsider to tell it to so the feeling
4382880	4388560	is that you're the only one falling short even though sometimes you see your so-called classmates
4388560	4393120	confessing to their own failures and then at that point you're like well at least it's not me and
4393120	4400080	you join in the denouncing of them motivated by your own sense of hidden shame because you are
4400080	4405040	led to feel like you are alone and that you alone have the deepest darkest failures against the
4405040	4410800	cult doctrine which is impossible and the guilt and shame are so overwhelming that they fuel even
4410800	4417360	more accusation and criticism and confession which is self-criticism just by virtue of how
4417360	4422080	they make you feel and that is the part of the environment the cult environment that does the
4422080	4428320	bulk of the indoctrination or brainwashing or thought reform work what is it brainwashing you
4428320	4434960	into well fifth lift and describes what he calls that all cults have at the center or all ideological
4434960	4440640	totalist environments have at the center a sacred science so at the heart of every cult is what
4440640	4447360	lyfton refers to as a sacred science that is infallible people can and do fail it all the time
4447360	4454480	but the doctrine itself cannot fail you've probably heard that before it's in this case it would be
4454480	4459280	queer theory cannot fail but people can fail queer theory and people are being brainwashed
4459280	4465440	into that sacred science the point of the cult of confession is to create a dynamic that forces
4465440	4469840	people to confess their failure to understand internalize and act and even embody the sacred
4469840	4474880	science the point of kevin kumashiro's leading people into emotional crisis and structuring
4474880	4480560	the environment around them so they resolve it productively is to lead them to internalize
4480560	4486320	and act and even embody the sacred science all while accusing others of their failings as much
4486320	4493360	and often as possible in the name of helping them in the same way the point of the confession is to
4493360	4498960	get people to willingly adopt the lens of the sacred science in this case queer theory so that
4498960	4505600	they can learn to quote recognize their crimes against the sacred science and the society aka
4505600	4512560	cult that supports it and to pledge to do better pledging to do better means ideologically remolding
4512560	4519200	yourself to use mouths words for it and here queer theory is given as the sacred science the
4519200	4523920	one true correct understanding of sex gender sexuality and all the normal features of society
4523920	4528560	and its definitions of what is and is not legitimate it is more than we're going to cover today but
4528560	4534560	it's a critical constructivist ideology of sex gender and sexuality which believes is sex gender
4534560	4539280	and sexuality are ultimately socially constructed phenomena that are the products of dominant power
4539280	4545520	that imprison people in a life that is structured by the power dynamics of society and it is their
4545520	4554640	obligation to wake up to that fact and to denounce all norms and legitimacy in order to try to overthrow
4554640	4564080	that system sixth lyfton calls it doctrine over person cults place doctrine over people if we
4564080	4568960	quote from hegel as i like to do at times like this history uses people and then discards them
4570400	4577360	the person isn't even a person in the eyes of the cult if they don't hold to and enact the doctrine
4577920	4584080	as mal said not to have correct political opinions is like not having a soul
4585600	4590400	i don't really need to elaborate on how doctrine operates over people you're not really a person
4590400	4595920	and you can't be associated with unless you are involved in and support the doctrine seventh
4597440	4602560	lyfton lo calls it loading the language do i have to describe how queer theory loads the
4602560	4606880	language all the words mean more than one things everything's got an agenda tucked in it
4606880	4613840	we're all very familiar with the language stuff now inclusion belonging diversity hate this is all
4613840	4619280	heavily loaded language that all advances the acceptance and spread of the agenda of the cult
4619280	4626160	and keeps people locked into it and eighth lyfton says the last characteristic of cults is dispensing
4626160	4630640	of existence and he says at the deepest level i'm not quoting him here i'm paraphrasing him
4630640	4638000	the cult decides whose existence counts and whose doesn't the punchline of this is that those who
4638000	4643280	accept the cult doctrine which is the sacred science and its application are considered people
4643280	4649840	and no one else is it's like they don't have a soul my is what mal said only the doctrine
4649840	4656400	nearly legitimate are allowed to exist at least in a spiritual sense everyone else is some kind of a
4656400	4663600	fallen deplorable hater effectively enemies and non people which justifies their abuse
4663600	4668400	their disenfranchisement their silencing cutting them out of your life even if they're your parents
4668400	4674000	and so on that's a cult environment and queer theory as you can see very easily satisfies
4674000	4680480	all of that just kind of for fun um the standard iron law of woke projection of course always applies
4680480	4685280	because it never misses and the dispensing of existence aspect of the cult environment says
4685280	4689760	kind of why woke activists always say everything is denying their existence or a genocide you know
4689760	4694880	they always say oh you deny our existence unless you give us gender affirming care uh it's a trans
4694880	4698880	genocide they're projecting what's happening is they're projecting it's the iron law of woke
4698880	4703760	projection their belief is that you don't have a right to exist if your beliefs quote unquote
4703760	4709040	deny their right to exist which is in quotes because you aren't denying their right to exist
4709040	4713920	you're denying their political identity which isn't even a real identity in queer theory this
4713920	4720160	means if you don't affirm their embodied political activism against everything legitimate and normal
4720160	4725200	then you're denying their existence it's like how they have fat studies people which took this idea
4725200	4731120	from queer theory by the way say that if you were to encourage weight loss programs and fitness and
4731120	4736720	eating better and losing weight um that what you would do is a fat genocide because if all the people
4736720	4740240	lost weight and there are no fat people there would be no fat culture and so you've committed a fat
4740240	4743920	genocide by getting rid of all the fat people and you say well we didn't get rid of anybody and
4743920	4748640	they say well there's no fat people so you get rid of fat people um and you think i'm making it up
4748640	4755120	but that's how they think and um because you are apparently willing to do a genocide of that kind
4755120	4760320	or a cultural genocide you're therefore beyond the pale of humanity and do not deserve to exist
4760320	4765680	that's actually the cult's logic and that's the logic of all totalitarian genocides that's it
4766320	4770320	the people who you know we have we have a communist utopia on the other side we have a queer
4770320	4776480	horizon of possibility and potentiality but transphobes and selfish capitalists and so on
4776480	4780880	won't let us have it so we've got to get rid of them we would already have communism socialism
4780880	4785040	would already be working great we would already have a communist utopia but some people are selfish
4785040	4790160	and won't won't give up their private property so let's just go seize their farms and get the
4790160	4794800	program going we could open our society back up you know if if everybody would just get their
4794800	4799040	vaccines if everybody would just 100% of everybody just got all their shots then we could just get
4799040	4805760	our economy back same logic all totalitarian genocides come from this darkest piece of cult
4805760	4810720	logic we could go a lot deeper into the nature of the queer theory cult and how it's a cult in this
4810720	4815920	i'm sure i will in future podcasts i'm not going to drag it out um i'm not going to get into the
4815920	4821120	whole gnostic hermetic conception of the world with normal society acting like a evil spirit
4821120	4826720	that imprisons everyone into performing a fake persona for the world that's gender performativity
4826720	4830720	so they can never be liberated to be who they truly are i've done that at length in other
4830720	4834240	podcasts i'll probably do it again i think there's one actually called queer theory is queer
4834240	4837680	narcissism or something you should go listen to that should also read the querying of the american
4837680	4845040	child where we cover this in tremendous depth um that would get us into talking about judith butler
4845040	4852160	when a queer theory's uh founding mothers i suppose fathers i mean whatever and her belief
4852160	4857680	that gender and sex aren't actually real but her performances we already talked about that um we learned
4858320	4865040	repeat those performances in order to satisfy normal society which is now acting like a
4865040	4870400	gnostic demiurge her whole body of work could be summarized like i said before in the six words
4870400	4874640	drag is life and life is drag so everybody's always doing drag and everything that they do
4874640	4879760	whether they realize it or not because society writes the scripts for how we do drag which is
4879760	4886320	usually cis hetero um and that we just do that and in her language borrowing from foucault she says
4886320	4892480	that imprisons their souls which they then have to script physically on that's her word script
4892480	4897840	them physically onto their body or inscribe onto their body and script into the society through
4897840	4903840	their bodies by performing gender and becoming aware of this doingness of gender maybe one day
4903840	4909040	already doing gender as a podcast as a paper that gets it's super influential that gets overlooked
4909040	4914400	a lot um but being coming out for judith butler becoming aware of the doingness of gender and
4914400	4918800	even sex and sexuality opens the door to that queer horizon of possibilities beyond the norm
4920560	4926800	she got those ideas in turn from michelle foucault we already talked about him
4927280	4933920	uh also from uh the radical feminism she was embedded in which would be Simone de Beauvoir
4936560	4939760	we could get really deep into that we've kind of done it before uh
4943120	4949280	what do i want to say here um the idea though is that you know society forces you to imprison
4949280	4956320	yourself uh in a gender performance or a mode of presentation and that you can break free of
4956320	4962640	that prison by understanding it um we're not going to get into the whole john money side of things
4962640	4967920	and stroller and greenson and the idea of gender identity that's another podcast for another day
4967920	4974000	but it it's basically what they did is kind of discombobulated the idea of who we are
4974000	4981440	by misusing the synonym for sex that is gender um initially likely as a synonym but then by
4981440	4986000	divorcing it from sex entirely that's its own story we're not going to get into the
4986000	4991280	i mean i did a podcast on this feminist something about feminist nosticism you can look it up
4991280	4996640	where i talk about uh Simone de Beauvoir and the pressing question of what is a woman
4996640	5002880	one is not born but becomes woman she said and her point was the same as foucault's about homosexuals
5002880	5007520	what does it mean to be a woman when no one else in particular society and patriarchy
5008160	5015200	get to tell you what it means to be a woman uh or for foucault a homosexual which
5015200	5021520	Halprin says means queer so in short we really could summarize this as a reconceptualization
5021520	5026880	of what i call social nosticism in which we are imprisoned by the features of our social reality
5026880	5032640	but can escape at least socio-spiritually with the right hidden insights about who we really are
5032640	5038320	and into what world we have been flung or thrown that's a hadegra reference if you don't know it
5038320	5043760	and that um by doing so that we might actually achieve liberation or emancipation that's why
5043760	5050800	their language is this way um this is a transformative social nosticism that reconceives
5050800	5059120	of the uh mysticism of earlier ages um that's a lot to get into about how characters such as
5059120	5066240	rousseau and hagel and marx preceding bivouar foucault and butler or even swedenborg and
5067120	5074640	jakaboma and some of these other characters maybe viko geambattista viko and some others all led
5074640	5080480	to this um social alchemy as described by the way and you should listen to my george soros podcast
5080480	5086320	about social alchemy but with queer theory and queer education in particular and social justice
5086320	5091440	education more broadly one of its primary laboratories for this mysticism is our children
5091440	5096240	and we should be really upset but we also should ask the question why children why does queer
5096240	5101680	theory target kids why is it so interested in children which is one of the characteristics
5101680	5106240	that i gave remember i said queer theory is the doctrine of a religious cult that cult is based
5106240	5112560	on sex it is little or nothing to do with gay people and it primarily targets children well
5112560	5119760	four reasons really first children are in schools typically and even with their entertainment uh
5119760	5124800	they are a captive environment captive audience in schools they have to go to school for 30 35
5124800	5130800	hours a week even if unless they're very strictly monitored in homeschooling the curriculum standards
5130800	5135760	are usually including this and so they're a captive audience second children have not achieved the
5135760	5140960	necessary cortical development in their brains to distinguish reality from fantasy so the
5140960	5146320	mystifications of queer theory can be considered plausible to them where adults would be less
5146320	5152080	interested third children are going through the developmental process processes i should say of
5152080	5158560	identity formation and puberty which need to be hijacked for this ideology to take firm root
5159360	5164320	just it's so tumultuous to grow up but you are also literally going through the process of figuring
5164320	5170560	out who you are which is a whole thing and they have to take advantage of that in order to get
5170560	5174560	queer theory to really take root but finally children become and this is really important from
5174560	5178720	the marxist perspective that queer theory is queer marxism again read queering of the american
5178720	5183840	child and really get your head around this it's important but children become a gateway into
5183840	5190960	families and they become a wedge into not just families but also other targets families faiths
5190960	5197360	and any institutions they grow up to become a part of they have to have a bottom up demand
5197360	5202320	that they're trying to force into our kids through brainwashing them at school to demand
5202320	5208880	the inclusive policies so they can have the ability to install them by what looks like
5208880	5214560	dint of demand rather than totalitarian top-down force that's how they're trying to get around that
5215680	5219920	okay so now we can summarize what is queer theory it's a doctrine of religious cult the
5219920	5224080	cult is primarily sex-based it predominantly targets children it has little nothing to do
5224080	5230240	with being gay and what can we do about it well normally we would turn to our institutions and
5230240	5235520	ask them to see the light and step in but we can't do that this isn't working our institutions are
5235520	5239440	actually captured our medical institutions or educational institutions or government institutions
5239440	5245600	or entertainment institutions or media institutions they're captured we face a problem of captured
5245600	5250480	institutions there's a like to phrase it now ideologically contaminated institutions our
5250480	5256400	institutions accept and promote queer theory all the way up to the white house we therefore cannot
5256400	5261600	count on our institutions educational psychological medical governmental anything to help us here
5261600	5267680	they're all captured what do we do they are part of the controlled melu in lyfton's language
5267680	5272560	they are creating the mystical manipulation they are peddling the sacred science of queer theory
5272560	5278080	they are in short the center of the problem so what's this like here's an analogy it's like
5278080	5283200	being a pilot and you're flying the plane and imagine all your instruments go out right so
5283200	5289840	you're flying the plane you're you're a pilot and everything goes out on the aircraft right no
5289840	5295360	navigation computer no altimeter nothing what do you have to do that's us we have our institutions
5295360	5300560	are like our our instruments what do you have to do if you're that pilot because this tells us
5300560	5304800	what we're going to do so imagine picture yourself in the cockpit you're flying a plane
5305760	5310160	and all you're in the air and all of a sudden all your instruments go out what do you have to do
5311040	5318400	you have to fly the plane safely mechanically and find a runway and land you don't get to rely on
5318400	5322320	your instruments because you don't have them like i said no navigation computer no altimeter
5322960	5329200	no speedometer nothing you have you you have your experience you have your wits and you're
5329200	5333520	hopefully the weather is good and you have enough ability to see what's in front of you to do the
5333520	5338320	right thing that's all you get that's like us our institutions are like the instruments in that
5338320	5342560	cockpit but for society not for an airplane and right now they're putting out all the wrong
5342560	5348640	information consistently they will not help us find a runway or land the plane safely and if we
5348640	5353440	take the plane analogy seriously our lives and the lives of everybody in the plane aka our society
5353440	5359120	depend on us doing this so what would we do in that situation we would use our senses we would
5359120	5365680	trust our eyes and ears in other words we would use our senses directly to look for the runway to
5365680	5371680	line up lower the plane land it and slow down and stop we wouldn't be looking to the broken
5371680	5376480	instruments at all we wouldn't be looking off into space we would look at reality around us and
5376480	5382000	navigate without the instruments as the intermediary and that's what we need to start finding ways to do
5382000	5387120	now at the societal level one individual at a time we need to start figuring out how to look
5387120	5394480	around us assess what's really going on and make smart judicious action where if we or if
5394480	5398960	we're rash if you just jerk the wheel or pull the throttle or whatever you're still going to crash
5398960	5404320	and everything's going to go bad we have to make smart decisions that take into account reality
5405440	5410800	individually what does that mean what do you do well what you start with is the truth not some
5410800	5415280	mediated truth peddled by these corrupt institutions but the plain simple truth the kind that you
5415280	5420000	can see with your eyes and experience and everybody knows like that there are two sexes that people
5420000	5426080	can't change sex that most people are straight that gay happens we don't know why that's fine
5426080	5430880	queer is not an identity it's a defiant political stance we don't have to tolerate or accommodate
5430880	5435280	how can you know that one with your own senses because it's in the fucking book defining it guys
5435280	5440000	it's in black and white they wrote it down themselves so if they tell you that you have that
5440000	5444880	information so if someone claims to have an identity or sexuality that requires an explanation
5444880	5450400	to put it simply it's fake that's that's common sense right if somebody claims to have an identity
5450400	5454400	or sexuality that requires an explanation it's fake and doesn't demand our respect
5454960	5459280	we don't have to respect this we have to be nice we're not nice we have to be
5461760	5466880	human to people we have to realize that the people in this cult are people in a cult
5466880	5472080	and they need help they need deprogramming they need therefore patience and compassion
5472080	5477280	and a landing pad and lots of things but we also have to recognize that there's a lot of predatory
5477280	5482560	behavior happening and predator predatory behavior of any kind in any place is not something that we
5482560	5487920	have to support or enable perversion outside of the confines if you want to call it this
5487920	5493200	of consenting adults acting in private does not deserve our tolerance and shouldn't be given it
5494080	5498000	our schools should not be doing any of this our schools should not be pushing
5498640	5503200	our kids into emotional crisis and then resolving it productively that's child abuse
5504080	5508800	our schools should not be putting pornography in front of our children whether it's in class
5508800	5515280	or through their libraries or through the curriculum through any various tricks and children do not
5515280	5520560	benefit from its presence there enough of this this is the kind of stuff is that you can start to
5520560	5524240	first recognize get your bearings if you're in that plane you've got to figure out what the
5524240	5527840	heck's going on you've got to get your bearings for yourself that's what i'm talking about wait a
5527840	5533200	minute porn in the schools what the hell what push kids into an emotional crisis and resolve it
5533200	5537760	according to our doctrine that's a problem what are you going to do you've got to assess what's
5537760	5542320	going on you've got to stop listening to the to the gas lighting in the bs and get your head on
5542320	5547840	straight you've got a plane to land and you don't have instruments in fact you have worse no
5547840	5554080	instruments you have lying instruments and with the where that is is in the truth so you've
5554080	5560160	got to look for the truth and you really have to look for it and you have to tell other people it
5560160	5563200	what i say a lot and you've heard this before i did a podcast on this is that you have to love the
5563200	5567360	truth i kind of riff from the bible you have to love the truth with all your heart and all your
5567360	5571760	mind and all your soul and all your strength and you have to love your neighbor enough to tell your
5571760	5578560	neighbor the truth as you would have him tell you the truth these are basic commandments this is
5578560	5584400	this this is how it sounds like that's not enough it's everything at the beginning and then you put
5584400	5590320	that into practice and you can fix the world but you really do have to love the truth because if
5590320	5594720	you love the truth you'll say it you won't care if they call you transphobic you'll seek it you'll
5594720	5600240	read these awful books you'll defend it when you get under attack or somebody else says you'll defend
5600240	5604640	other people who are saying it you'll support them you'll back them up you have to love the truth
5604640	5608400	because if you don't eventually the splc is going to write an article about you and you're going to
5608400	5613360	back off you'll buckle they're going to threaten to take something away from you or your kids that
5613360	5618560	you can't bear and you'll buckle and you'll get pulled into this caring affirming nonsense
5620400	5624000	but the fact of the matter is that there's no caring and there's no affirmation that isn't
5624000	5628080	first built on the truth so you're going to have to love the truth and you're going to have to
5628080	5634320	to push it and defend it and help other people do it in tough situations there's no other way
5634960	5640320	and every time you tell a lie just remember this every time you tell a lie to to be nice or to fit
5640320	5644960	in the pronoun game or whatever you're selling a piece of your soul so you have to stop doing that
5645600	5650560	and that's what it means really to love the truth and if you start there telling the truth that's
5650560	5654320	what solzhenichin said is that if you tell the truth one man telling the truth can bring down a
5654320	5658880	regime it starts a ripple effect one person telling the truth is a lot becomes a lot of people
5658880	5663200	telling the truth facts start to come out then there's more things to tell the w path files come out
5663200	5667760	next thing you know this entire medical monstrosity starts to crumble out from under and you say well
5667760	5671760	we can't get the law to go along this we can't get the courts to agree with us keep fighting because
5671760	5676160	day by day by day something else comes out keep digging somebody had to go look up what's going
5676160	5682000	on at w path whether it's me a hues or whoever digging into it um there's other revelations
5682000	5686960	i guess i do no harm just release them the daily color just release them somebody's digging into
5686960	5691920	it so start digging get curious ask questions read the materials figure out who's funding it
5691920	5696720	whatever happens to be and then report on it and when you do these things which is what it means
5696720	5701680	to be based by the way you break the melu control and you can start to break apart the cult you also
5701680	5709280	need to protect your kids obviously um to keep them out of the controlled melu uh into one that
5709360	5713120	you children are supposed to be in a sheltered melu and the parents are in charge of that
5713120	5718080	sheltering um you also when you do these things you tell the truth you seek the truth you fight
5718080	5723760	for the truth you defend the truth every day you don't just break melu control you but you break
5723760	5728800	apart mystical manipulation they can't trick you if they end up doing this huge stage demonstrate
5728800	5734160	demonstration and you say that's planned spontaneity and it's fake it makes it lose its magical power
5735120	5742000	you by doing this cast doubt upon the so-called sacred science gender ideology starts looking
5742000	5747120	not just even incorrect but ridiculous and the more people who think it's ridiculous the more
5747120	5751840	people who will either loudly or quietly walk away from it what happens when you start doing this
5751840	5756320	and start doing it consistently and start doing it every day like billboard chris showing up one
5756320	5761600	conversation at a time getting clear on his pursuing the information getting clear getting out there
5761600	5767360	and talking to people as you start to break those cycles of abuse you break the cult of confession
5767360	5771440	you tell people that it's okay to trust their eyes and their ears and even their gut intuition
5771440	5776800	and to believe in common sense again and to understand therefore very clearly that what
5776800	5781760	they are experiencing and seeing in queer theory is abusive and manipulative because queer theory
5781760	5786320	is the doctrine as i said of a cult religion that is based on sex that primarily targets
5786320	5792000	their children has very little to do nothing to do really with being gay it's hostile in fact to
5792000	5798480	gay interests in every regard if we might use this phrase gay interests and so it's our necessary
5798480	5803760	responsibility to learn as much about it as we can both in theory and in practice and to
5803760	5810800	tell people about it and oppose it um like i said you can read a lot of what i had to say here
5810800	5815680	in my book with logan lansing it's his book really that i helped with called the querying of the american
5815680	5822800	child um i hope this was a informative episode it was a lot longer than i meant um i gave this
5822800	5828800	talk at pit in like 45 minutes and here we are at almost an hour and 40 but i hope you'll forgive me
5829680	5835600	more to come soon i've got more horrifying un documents and other things coming so thank
5835600	5851520	you for listening and i'll catch you in the next one
5865600	5867060	you
