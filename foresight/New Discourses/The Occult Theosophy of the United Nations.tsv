0	24400	Hey everybody, it's James Lindsay. You're listening to the New Discourses podcast, and in particular
24400	29040	you're listening to another long weird episode of the New Discourses podcast because we're going
29040	36160	to talk about something weird yet again in rather tremendous depth. We're going to talk about the
36160	41440	United Nations. And a matter of fact, what we're going to talk about is there was a United Nations
41440	48000	character, I'll kind of spell this out in a minute named Robert Mueller, and in the 2000 days leading
48000	57600	up to the year 2000. So the 2000 days leading up to January 1st, 2000, Robert Mueller, who was by
57600	67120	no means a small player in the United Nations pantheon, laid out what he called 2000 ideas and
67120	73680	dreams for a better world, or sometimes he referred to it as 2000 ideas, or 2000 ideas for the year
73680	81440	2000. And in essence, he was laying out ideas and dreams like kind of his just thoughts, 2000 of
81440	85440	them as a matter of fact, for the direction that the United Nations should take and the role it
85440	91040	should play in the world in the 21st century. And the point of this podcast is to tell you some
91040	95360	of what he said, and so that we can realize that the direction of the United Nations, whatever
95360	100880	the United Nations was intended to be from its origins, and since it originated with the Huxleys,
101920	106880	I don't think it was necessarily ever meant to be a good organization. I think it's always had
106880	114240	theosophical roots, but it is unambiguous in these documents that Robert Mueller, and I'll tell you
114240	118960	who he is in a second, you know who he is, you just don't realize you know who he is. He's not the
118960	124000	guy that prosecuted Trump. That's a different Robert Mueller, or I should say, investigated
124000	128560	Trump. It's spelled differently. They're not the same guy. But you've heard of him before.
130160	135520	It's unambiguous in these documents that Robert Mueller wanted the United Nations to reconstitute
135520	141520	itself for the 21st century, that he wasn't satisfied with how theosophical the United Nations
141520	145600	was in the 20th century, and he wanted it to reconstitute itself as an explicitly
146160	151040	very theosophical organization going into the 21st century. So he delivers this in the late
152640	160400	1999, I should specify, to the UN Secretary General at the time and urges him to read these,
160400	168080	and he actually, the document I'm pulling from is a small document that he sent specifically to
168080	172640	the Secretary General to pay attention to, which is a condensation. So the way Robert Mueller
172640	178240	published 2000 ideas and dreams for a better world, or 2000 ideas for the year 2000,
178960	185520	was in four volumes. I'll make all four volumes are on his website, Robert Mueller.org. I'll make
185520	192240	those available in links to this so you can go see all 2000 ideas if you want. He said he was
192240	197440	going to write 3000 ideas because the plans were meant to extend to the year 3000 for the United
197440	204560	Nations, but I don't know if the other 1000 ever got written. I haven't looked that deeply into it
204560	210720	yet, but he wrote this condensed version where he wrote 59 pages of the ones that he thought was
210720	216320	more most important in the realm of spiritual direction that the UN should take in world
216320	220960	leadership, including of course, a one world government headquartered through the United
220960	225600	Nations or coordinated through the United Nations. And it's kind of creepy how much of it seems to
225600	231360	fit with what we're dealing with, because this is straight occult theosophy guiding the ship of
231360	236400	the United Nations, which means the United Nations, whatever it started as, and like I said, I don't
236400	242160	think it started good. I think it's always been an occult theosophical organization, and I think
242160	246640	there are reasons to believe that that's true, some of which I've discussed before, like in the
246640	256560	WTF is SEL podcast. Certainly for the last two decades, since I will say specifically 2003,
256560	263120	it has been oriented toward a transformational project, and that transformational project is
263120	267520	rooted in occult theosophy. So it's not a good organization. It's not a neutral organization.
267520	273600	It's not even really a governing organization. It is an occult organization. It is a best you
273600	280320	could say is really weird organization. Worst you could say is that it's genuinely an evil
280320	285680	organization. And I think that we, this is all very positive the way that Robert Mueller wrote
285680	289600	this, but I think that we're going to come away understanding that. And because this is going
289600	295360	to be really long, I've set aside almost 10,000 words of his writing to explore. I want to just
295360	301920	kind of dive in and not preamble too much, but we got to start with who is Robert Mueller.
301920	307040	So Robert Mueller worked at the United Nations. It's M-U-L-L-E-R. It's not, again, the same guy
307040	311680	who investigated Trump. That's a different Robert Mueller, spelled differently. He worked at the
311680	316640	United Nations for over 40 years. He was at one time the assistant secretary general, so he was
316640	322240	very high up. He was very well respected. He was very well networked throughout the United Nations
322240	327520	through much of that long career. But more importantly, and this is where you've heard
327520	333360	of him before, is he's the guy who developed the World Core Curriculum, which was meant to be
333360	342560	a new education method for the entire planet, according to a set of core curriculum points
342560	347520	that were going to be core to the entire world's education program. In the United States, that
347520	355120	became Common Core. So Common Core was created slightly indirectly, but basically by Robert
355120	362320	Mueller at the United Nations. Now, I introduced that concept to you previously. In the very long
362320	368720	WTF is SEL. What the F is, Social Emotional Learning Podcasts that I did some time ago,
368720	374000	where I pointed out that Robert Mueller's ideas were, in fact, strongly influenced by
374000	380320	the occult theosophist who created the Lucifer publishing company named Alice Bailey. His ideas
380400	385840	about education were inspired by an an occult theosophist named Alice Bailey. Now, the point of
385840	390880	that podcast wasn't to talk about Common Core and its origins or Robert Mueller, it was just kind of a
391760	395680	sidebar. The point was to talk about Social Emotional Learning and its development at the
395680	400400	Fedser Institute. Now, I want to remind you, by the way, so far as these two programs go,
400400	404640	Social Emotional Learning and Common Core, both of which, both of these were very heavily funded
404640	408880	by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation gave hundreds of
408880	414480	millions of dollars to pushing the Common Core or the World Core curriculum into the United States,
414480	419680	but that wasn't enough. And when Common Core kind of started to falter and it got replaced with
419680	426640	Social Emotional Learning starting in 2015 and 16, Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation has dumped
426640	432560	possibly up to two billion dollars into pushing that. But the point is that they're both based in
432560	440480	the same occult theosophy, deriving from the rantings of Alice Bailey and others. But Robert
440480	445440	Mueller was no small player. Like I said, he was Assistant Secretary General of the United Nations
445440	450080	for a while. He was named the Chancellor of the United Nations University for Peace, which is
450080	456800	headquartered in Costa Rica. He talks about this. He also organized a group you haven't heard about
456800	461600	yet, but you're going to need to hear about, which is called the Evolutionary Leaders. Who are the
461600	466640	Evolutionary Leaders? Well, they're a bunch of theosophical occult weirdos who believe in something
466640	472000	that is called the New Thought Movement or New Thought Religion. I would say it's the Gnostic
472000	478800	New Thought Movement, because it is a Gnostic and Hermetic kind of spin-off cult. It has roots tied
478800	483280	back to, I know I've talked about this briefly in the past with some of the Gnosticism and Hermeticism
483280	489120	podcasts, has roots tied back into the Kabalian, which is probably written by this guy Atchkinson.
489120	494400	I always say his name a little bit messed up. I got to work on that. And so this is like legit,
494400	501040	legit, theosophical, I would say New Age, but the name of it's actually New Thought. And then
501040	506000	it's a Gnostic approach. It's a Gnostic religion. And their goal is to make a Gnostic One World
506000	513440	Religion that's the one religion in the world that's coordinated and interwoven with the governments,
513440	520080	a world government through the United Nations. And you would be very familiar if you are a daytime
520080	526880	TV aficionado from the 90s and early 2000s, with lots of the evolutionary leaders, even though you
526880	531440	didn't know you're familiar with them, because Oprah Winfrey has platformed every single one of them.
532400	538640	The so-called New Age stuff, which is all occult theosophy, that Oprah Winfrey and her
538640	544800	book club mainlined into middle-class moms and primarily their daughters and somewhat their sons
545840	553200	for the last several, you know, decades, is all Gnostic New Thought. And the New Thought movement
553200	557760	itself, by the way, has been recognized as a world religion now. It's not recognized in the
557760	565680	United States specifically as a religion, but it is recognized as a world religion
565680	571680	by the international body that certifies these things. So I want to thank particularly Lisa
571680	577360	Logan for showing me this. I mean, I wasn't digging into Robert Mueller, I probably should have been,
577360	582960	but she started to, and she showed me this, and she's helped me understand and link out all the
582960	588240	connections between Robert Mueller and the United Nations to the evolutionary leaders, which she's
588240	592960	researching tremendously right now, and to the Gnostic New Thought movement, which she's
593040	598240	researching right now. And she got into chasing all this down basically by pursuing the Alice
598240	602800	Bailey stuff that we were talking about about a year ago, and so a little over a year ago now,
602800	609040	like a year and a half ago. So this is deep and dark stuff, and I'm barely skimming the surface
609040	614400	of it. And I really want to thank Lisa Logan for all the work she's doing and for bringing this to
614400	617360	my attention so that I can bring it to your attention. But if you really want to want the
617360	620880	deep dives on this, she's already been putting some of it out, and she's going to be putting a
620880	624480	lot more of it out, she's going to really expose this. You need to go follow and pay attention
624480	629360	to Lisa Logan. So she's at I Am Lisa Logan. Everything's spelled the way you think it is.
630160	635680	That's on the X, and you can figure her out further from there. She's doing an amazing job
635680	641280	digging this stuff up and making us understand it. So she sent me this condensed document that is
641280	648480	59 pages of a summary for 2000 ideas and dreams for a better world. And I have stuck to that
648480	652480	document, even though when you go read the all 2000 of the ideas, like there are some other
652480	657680	ones that are so insane that it was super hard not to add them. It's very hard not to read basically
657680	662960	all of this, which would take like weeks of podcasts to get through all of it. There's 2000
662960	672960	of them. But anyway, this document was originally published and sent with its full reply on March
672960	680080	17, 1999. It says it begins with a handful of letters back and forth between Robert Muller
680080	686320	and the Office of the Secretary General of the United Nations. And it says, Dear Robert,
686320	692000	your thoughtful letter and book ideas and dreams for a better world arrived. The Secretary General
692000	696720	wishes to thank you for the dedication and inspiration you continue to give to the cause of
696720	703440	peace, justice, and freedom. Your dynamic and eloquent leadership gives you courage or sorry,
703440	708720	gives courage to so many who share our goals. The Secretary General looks forward to reading
708720	714640	your book with care and ask that I convey your views to other officials. So why I included this
714640	720640	little letter reply from the beginning is to frame who Robert Muller is. He's a very important
720640	726640	character. The Secretary General has a direct correspondence with him. He wishes to thank
726640	734480	Robert Muller for his dedication and inspiration. And he can he applauds Robert Muller's dynamic
734480	741360	and eloquent leadership. And in particular, though, this is what he says is that he this dynamic and
741360	747280	eloquent leadership gives courage. And I quote to so many who share our goals. Well, what are those
747280	753360	goals? This is an occult theosophy document. As you're going to hear, what are the goals of the
753360	758240	United Nations? That's the question that this really raises. And I want to point out, it says,
758240	762320	the Secretary General looks forward to reading your book with care and ask that I convey your
762320	768560	views to other officials. So this is in March, 1999, March 17, 1999. As a matter of fact,
769440	775520	my thought is, almost all of this horrific stuff, whether it's ESG, guess what year that was created
775520	781520	2003. Comprehensive Sexuality Education, 2003. A bunch of the other UNESCO and UN initiatives
781520	786960	that are actually shaping the global agenda that we're all getting put through right now,
786960	793680	all started in 2003, which is a few years down the road from this. Did this inform those? That's a
793680	799520	legitimate question at this point. The reorganization and kind of pedal to the metal of the United
799520	803840	Nations, which at the time would have been pushing agenda 21. So what's the relevance of the timing?
803920	809600	The idea was that by the year 2021, which did not succeed, that we would enter into a new world.
809600	814000	That was the idea of agenda 21. And it was based off of what we're called the Millennium Development
814000	818880	Goals, which preceded the Sustainable Development Goals. Okay. And there were eight of those,
818880	822880	there are 17 Sustainable Development Goals, I will remind you with their magic number 17.
824000	830800	So I'm strongly suspicious that the reason that it all started in 2003,
830800	836320	and this goes 2003 plus 17 is 2020. So they have a 17 year long cycle in order to try to
837360	844800	implement agenda 21 so that the new world starts on, it starts in, I don't know what date they
844800	850240	would have picked specifically within the year, but in 2021. Much like we're supposed to have a
850240	856000	new world now as they delayed it and pushed it back in 2030. That's why they call it the 17
856000	863280	Sustainable Development Goals are for 2030. It's literally called agenda 2030. People want to say
863280	867760	you're a conspiracy theorist, is it a conspiracy? If it's like literally an agenda, wouldn't the
867760	871840	people be working on the agenda? Wouldn't the secretary general looks forward to reading your
871840	876320	book with care and ask that I convey your views to other officials because it gives leaders,
876320	880480	or sorry, it gives courage to so many who share our goals. Well, what the hell are those goals?
880480	885360	Well, let's dive into this and see what some of this book says. But first, let me give you
885360	891680	some context, because the next thing in the document that was published here that I have
891680	896000	is that Robert Mueller, this is the response to Robert Mueller's letter, Robert Mueller then
896000	902160	includes his own letter that he sent. I'm not going to read all of it, obviously. And this isn't
902160	907840	the excerpts from the book. This is just the cover letter. And he sent that on March 6. So
907920	915120	again, just to underline how what a deal this guy is, Robert Mueller sent this on March 6,
915120	921680	1999. And 11 days later, and I'm not common claiming some numerology to that, 11 days later,
921680	925840	he had a response saying that it was going to be disseminated through the secretary general of the
925840	930640	UN and other people. So he's a very influential character. So his letter, Robert Mueller's letter,
930640	935920	this is Robert Mueller, starts off this way. Dear Mr. Secretary General, with the year 2000,
935920	942960	you are becoming the most important person on earth in the entire human history. How can you
942960	950320	face this overwhelming challenge in one of the most complex and messy human, earth, and evolutionary
950320	957440	situations this planet has ever known? Well, here are a few advices from a lifetime world
957440	962640	public servant and direct aid to three former secretaries general. I'm not going to read all
962640	968480	these advices, which are mostly a reminder to the secretary general of his power and his importance
968480	974880	as what's called the Millennium Assembly for the year 2000 was approaching. So what was this
974880	981200	power and importance? Obviously, you are becoming the most important person on earth in the entire
981200	989120	human history because of the year 2000 is what Mueller said to the guy. And in terms of what
989120	996240	the complex, messy human, earth, and evolutionary situations, the most complex ones that the earth
996240	1002400	has ever known. And so he's reminding him of his power in terms of getting all of the world's
1002400	1008720	leaders on the same page as their agenda. And so that's what that's what the advices are really
1008720	1012320	about. You need to wake up in the morning and look at yourself and realize how important your job is.
1012320	1016320	You need to get the other world leaders on board with what we're doing. We need as many of them as
1016320	1020400	possible. That's your role. We have to prepare for the Millennium Assembly. That's the kind of
1020400	1025920	advices that are there. And I'm laughing that he called it advices, plural instead of advice.
1026880	1031760	So then after indicating that the secretary general should have all of his officers read all
1031760	1038880	four volumes of this 2000 ideas, and to incorporate as many of them are useful into the Millennium
1038880	1044960	Assembly, which is supposed to set the trajectory for the United Nations in the new millennium. So
1044960	1050480	in some sense, not just for the 21st century, but all the way to the year 3000, presuming like I
1050480	1054800	told you a minute ago that Robert Mueller believed that there would be UN global governance till
1054800	1064320	the year 3000, a millennium of this tyranny. After urging that all the officers read this 2000 ideas
1064320	1069760	book that I'm going to share from, he then notes that the purpose of this particular document that
1069760	1076400	he's sending, which is an excerpt from the four volumes, is to relay 59 pages of the ideas that
1076400	1082080	he wrote in 2000 ideas that are pertinent to a global religious movement. And I'm telling you,
1082080	1085760	it's a cult theosophy. And that's what we're going to focus on. In fact, we're going to focus hard
1085760	1090880	on that one magic word there, evolutionary. Because that's what these people think that
1090880	1094320	they're doing. And like I said, Robert Mueller organized a group that are called the evolutionary
1094320	1099360	leaders that believe that they're going to be able to direct the spiritual evolution of man
1099360	1104720	in the correct direction. Now, I will point out that theosophists throughout history have believed
1104720	1110000	this. The Gnostics believed this. The ancient Hermeticists believe this. Karl Marx believed
1110000	1114320	this. The point of seizing the means of economic production was that Karl Marx believed that the
1114320	1119840	means of economic production produced economic conditions. And economic conditions produced
1119840	1125520	people. It produced who you were. So if you seize and transform the means of economic production,
1125520	1131440	you seize the means of producing man to be different. In fact, to become socialist or
1131440	1137920	eventually communist, ideally, which is a spiritual evolution because Marx's idea is that communism
1137920	1143920	in its true form is the, in his words, positive transcendence of private property as human
1143920	1149520	self-estrangement. So in other words, it is a Marx believed that we're going to seize the means of
1149520	1159600	production of man so that we transcend our fallen form of private property owning individuals.
1159600	1166080	We're going to go back into a unified social and creative entity, mass entity, collective entity,
1166080	1172000	where we are our own creators, direct our own evolution. And the end point of that evolution
1172000	1179280	is this liberated communist utopia. And this isn't that far off. This is a another branch
1179280	1184640	on the same tree. I'm not calling this guy a Marxist. I don't think he is. I think he's another
1184640	1191040	branch on the same theosophical tree. That's what this document is actually about is
1192240	1198720	communicating 59 pages worth of these crackpot ideas. And I had to do some work to select down
1198720	1204080	to just staying under 10,000 words of them pertinent to a global religious movement.
1204640	1210960	And that global religious movement's purpose is to direct the future evolution of man. There's
1210960	1219440	a word for that. It's called eugenics. Evolutionary leaders could be called eugenics leaders very
1219440	1225120	easily. It's like a rebrand to hide what they really are. But I want to stress that the goal
1225120	1230240	is not whether it's communism, whether it's new thought, the goal, whether it's Margaret Sanger's
1230240	1235440	Planned Parenthood, which is another branch on this same tree. The goal is not and Alice Bailey
1235440	1240880	made this very clear. And I talked about this in the WTF is SEL podcast as well about Alice Bailey.
1240880	1248240	The goal is not to direct the physical evolution of man. So so much to say Alice Bailey called that
1248240	1255760	exoteric eugenics and said it's not good. It's to direct the spiritual evolution of man, which is
1256480	1261920	of course co constituted or intrinsically interwoven with the physical evolution of man.
1261920	1266880	So the goal is actually to direct man on a spiritual level, but we have to work with the
1266880	1273520	crude means that we have. In other words, as above so below, so the spiritual level of man
1274000	1281520	imprints on his physical form and as below so above. So we work with the physical forms. We work
1281520	1288160	with physical things to direct the spiritual evolution as below so above. And when that happens,
1288160	1293280	just like Karl Marx believed in the cycle of man creates society, creates man, creates society,
1294000	1298880	here we have the idea that we're going to direct the consciousness of man until the
1298880	1304320	consciousness of man changes spiritual evolution. And that will cause a new man to arise who's more
1304320	1308880	in line with that level of spirituality. And their goal is to push us into a new age,
1309920	1315040	which just so happens to be under their control. Because of their global world, I want to say
1315040	1319440	religion that there's the word they're kind of using it, but it's a cult. This is the largest
1319440	1324080	cult startup in the history of the world. And ultimately, the theosophical religions across
1324080	1331840	the board all have the exact same idea that the fundamental human right is to be back in the
1331840	1338240	Garden of Eden. We have a fundamental right to a liberated utopia. So when you hear them talk about
1338240	1343280	our human rights or whatever, then you say, well, they just seem to make up a new right like every
1343280	1348320	other day. This is right. That's right. Everything's an intrinsic right. What they believe is that they
1348320	1354640	have an intrinsic right to live in utopia. And literally, it's to, if we go kind of deeper into
1354640	1362240	the old theosophical religions, that to re-enter into the Garden of Eden, that the God that kicked
1362240	1367920	us out is some kind of an evil demagogic being, or it's a result of a cosmic negative accident that
1367920	1374560	kicked us out of our inheritance in the perfected utopia of Eden. And that we have an inalienable
1374560	1382960	right to live in Eden that we have been alienated from because of a cruel and wicked circumstance
1382960	1390320	of whatever caused us to fall in the past. It was the serpent luring us to eat the fruit of the tree
1390320	1396480	of the knowledge of good and evil, and then God kicked us out, which is characterized as an evil
1396480	1403040	act and proof that the God portrayed in Genesis as a demon, or with Marx as the advent of private
1403040	1408640	property and the individualism that follows from it. With the queer theory, it would be the advent of
1408640	1414160	people believing they can define what it means to be normal for a human being, and thus falling into
1414160	1419520	the same kind of situation and estranging one another. But their belief is that we have a
1419520	1425360	fundamental inalienable right to re-enter the Garden of Eden. And that happens by advancing our
1425360	1434320	spiritual and collective societal human evolution into the direction indicated by their religious
1434320	1440560	crack pottery. So like I said, it is the largest cult startup in the history of the world. And my
1440560	1445840	essential claim, just to put it very bluntly in this podcast, is that at least in this century,
1445840	1451360	so at least for the last two decades and maybe a little more, the United Nations has been
1451360	1458400	devoted to this goal and has been devoted to being the headquarters for this cult movement,
1458400	1462080	with all of its power, all of its extensions. And so there's no reason that we should be
1462080	1468480	participating in the United Nations whatsoever. It is a cult theosophical organization. That's
1468480	1474480	my hypothesis. So just another snippet from Muller, before we get down to these ideas, he says,
1474480	1479920	with Dr. Karen Singh of India, we have just created a world commission on global consciousness and
1479920	1487120	spirituality to promote a much needed spiritual renaissance. That's the goal of this document.
1487120	1492320	That's the goal of what the United Nations was setting up around the year 2000, up to 2003,
1492320	1497680	when they started pushing all of this stuff. He says, I'm sending other members an excerpt of
1497680	1503760	59 pages of ideas regarding religion and spirituality similar to the one on the future and
1503760	1510320	futures capitalized here. So that's this document. That's the 59 pages. This document is the 59 pages
1510320	1515520	of what Robert Muller thinks the United Nations needs to understand about religion and spirituality
1515520	1520160	and what it should look like in the 21st century and actually in the entire third millennium.
1520160	1524480	And it's all connected to something that they call their world commission on global consciousness
1524480	1529600	and spirituality. There's that consciousness word. That's a theosophical tell that there's
1529600	1534320	some secret consciousness that you awaken to that if you don't have it, you're basically like cattle.
1535120	1542480	And this document is meant to be issued in pursuit of a, quote, much needed spiritual renaissance.
1543760	1549840	Like I said, he then goes on to note that he says, these are Robert Muller's 2000 ideas
1549840	1557920	started on 11 July 1994, 2000 days before 1 January 2000. So I'd only bring it up because
1557920	1564560	I want to point out to you how invested they are in symbolism. It's not a hard calculation,
1564560	1568560	but it's a calculation. You have to sit down and very intentionally decide to figure out which
1568560	1576480	day on the calendar is 2000 days before January 1, 2000. And that day happened to work out
1576480	1584320	mathematically to July 11, 1994. And that was the day he decided to start writing 2000 ideas
1584320	1588800	for the 21st century. He didn't write one idea a day, even though that seems to be it.
1588800	1593440	He wrote on average one idea per day, but he also is proud that he finished a little bit
1593440	1599840	early. And that's why he was able to submit this on the 6th of March 1999 instead of having to wait
1599840	1604960	until, you know, December or something. And so this document I'm about to read from is exactly
1604960	1610160	what Muller indicates. It's 59 pages totaling perhaps a couple hundred of these 2000 ideas
1610160	1614560	that he considers specifically essential to a spiritual renaissance for the world,
1614560	1620560	meant to be facilitated and coordinated into a single world religion through the United Nations.
1620560	1624960	I am not going to read all of the ideas, all the few hundred ideas in this, I'm not going to read
1624960	1628880	them in order either because that would bury the lead. Now I am burying the lead a little bit,
1628880	1632960	but I want to give you a flavor of it. And we're going to, of course, build in the level of crazy.
1632960	1636640	So stick with me. But I'm going to start with some of the ideas further down on the list.
1637600	1641440	And then kind of return to some earlier ones with a couple of exceptions. I'm going to do
1641440	1645920	a couple right from the very beginning, just to give you an idea, because it's again relevant
1645920	1650960	to understanding who Robert Muller is and what much of his life work involved. And I just want
1650960	1657360	you to keep in the back of your mind all along. This is the guy who created the education program
1657360	1665600	that became Common Core. This is the guy who created Common Core. So idea 105 written on the
1665600	1673680	23rd of October, 1994. For the sake of this planet and humanity's future, an office of global
1673680	1680640	education should be created in every ministry of education. Global education should be required in
1680640	1686960	all schools of earth, from kindergarten to university, and in all professional schools,
1686960	1692640	especially for journalism and the media. So he understood very clearly that messaging
1692720	1698880	apparatuses and schools, messaging apparatuses need to be captured through their schools,
1698880	1702720	and he understood that schools themselves need to be turned into brainwashing apparatuses
1702720	1706480	for his global education. And that's the Common Core program that he invented.
1706480	1712400	So then that's idea 105, idea 103, which he wrote two days earlier on the 21st of October, 1994.
1713280	1719040	While the exact sciences are all of a global universal nature, the social sciences are not.
1719040	1725600	Now, reflecting what we just talked about with George Soros, who published the book Alchemy of
1725600	1731440	Finance, arguing exactly the same thing two years before this. While the exact sciences are all of
1731440	1738240	a global universal nature, the social sciences are not, there is urgent need for a global anthropology,
1738240	1746080	global sociology, global psychology, global political science that he calls planetetics.
1746320	1753440	Did I say that right? No, planetics, sorry, planetics, planet ICS, planetics, sorry,
1754240	1762160	global literature, global art, global culture, global philosophy, global futurology, etc.
1762800	1769360	Margaret Mead was the first prophet recommending it. Now, Margaret Mead is the anthropologist who
1769360	1775680	went around and is basically the mother of cultural relativism, which is this kind of idea that
1776160	1781440	matriculated strongly into the social sciences and in particular into the postmodern theory
1782000	1788160	that says that no culture can judge one another. And this actually dovetails very nicely with these
1788800	1794160	occult theosophical ideas, which is that there's exactly one religion, thus there's exactly one
1794160	1800720	philosophy, there's exactly one science, there's exactly one faith, there's exactly one culture.
1800720	1806800	And what that actually is, is what they called the Priska Theologia, the ancient theology, which
1806800	1815280	is the occult theology that is frankly flat out denied by the Bible. So we're not looking in
1815280	1819760	good directions here so far. So let me just give you, now that we've had a lot of preamble,
1819760	1826240	throat clearing, etc., let me just give you the trigger warning, I guess, what is going to sound
1826240	1832640	like an old 1950s TV show, or maybe unsolved mysteries from the 1980s. What you are about to
1832640	1838560	hear will disturb you. It's true. What you're about to hear will actually probably disturb you.
1838560	1846640	My only commentary then in setting out is, I want you to keep in mind, this is the real United
1846640	1851200	Nations. When we look under the hood of the UN, this is what we're dealing with. Even with all
1851200	1857840	the positive aspirational language, this is disturbing. This is a cult theosophy trying to
1857840	1865360	create a world cult religion that we're all stuck inside. And it's, in fact, a transformational
1865360	1873040	religion, a transmutational religion, a evolutionary religion. And so they mean to seize the means of
1873040	1879920	human spiritual production and societal production, such that we will move into our next evolutionary
1879920	1885520	phase. And that's the goal of the United Nations, at least in the 21st century and third millennium.
1885520	1889440	So let's start with some stuff we generally already know about the UN and its agendas,
1889440	1895040	so we don't overwhelm too quickly, so that we can kind of understand how to orient what we already
1895040	1899440	know about the United Nations in terms of what Mueller is indicating is underneath those agendas,
1899440	1904080	which is the occult theosophy that this podcast is about. So as a result, I'm going to start near
1904080	1911680	the end of the document with idea 1912. The creation, he says, by the Rio de Janeiro Conference
1911680	1917200	of an Earth Council, so we're all familiar that a lot of this environmental sustainability crap
1917200	1922880	all got kicked off and coordinated at the Rio conference, the Earth Council, in 1992.
1923440	1928880	So the creation of the Rio de Janeiro Conference of an Earth Council is a great step ahead in
1928880	1935680	human history. One of its first tasks is to draft an Earth charter. An admirable text of that charter
1935680	1942960	is now in circulation among non-governmental organizations, NGOs, for their comments. It
1942960	1949600	opens a completely new chapter of world charters. So here's where the NGOs become the relevant bodies
1949600	1956080	to push all of this crap. We also need a charter for the seas and oceans, a charter for outer space,
1956080	1960960	for the air and atmosphere, for the world's waters, for mountain areas, and for arid zones,
1960960	1966560	for the world's forestry covers, for the world's vegetation, for other species, for human settlements,
1966560	1974080	etc. A vast new field of human philosophy, behavior, and future evolution has been opened,
1974080	1981920	the fundamental rights of the Earth. So all of this sustainable crap follows straight from this,
1982640	1987600	and you hear what they're after, governance of everything in a evolutionary,
1987600	1993280	theosophical sense, governance of everything, the seas, the oceans, outer space, the air,
1993280	2001520	the atmosphere, the water, mountains, deserts, forests, vegetation, all the species, human
2001520	2008560	settlements, they want control over all of it. And we see exactly those kinds of things coming down
2008560	2014000	the pike today. That's exactly what they're working with with this kind of new Earth charter.
2015600	2024560	So idea 1930. The UN General Assembly 2000 at the heads of states level must absolutely measure
2024560	2030720	up to its historical tasks and be remembered for its audacity and long-term views of the future.
2031280	2037360	It should above all decide to embark on the writing of a constitution for proper Earth
2037440	2045280	government. If it does not, future historians will not forgive its members. So in the year 2000,
2045280	2051440	the United Nations General Assembly is tasked, at least in this idea, with embarking on the writing
2051440	2056720	of a new constitution for proper Earth government. Which does what? What the previous thing said.
2058320	2063840	It opens up a vast new field of human philosophy, behavior, and future evolution
2063840	2068800	in the fundamental rights of the Earth. So the constitution, that's supposed to be for global
2068800	2074240	government, that they're supposed to write in the year 2000, is designed to push the fundamental
2074240	2080400	rights of the Earth. And he says if it does not, future historians will not forgive its members.
2080400	2084240	Well, it turns out future historians are probably not going to forgive its members,
2084240	2091920	but it's not because they did not. It's because they did. Idea 1931. At this stage of our evolution,
2091920	2097920	the concept of completion and survival of, sorry, I messed that up. At this stage of our evolution,
2097920	2104400	so let's let's frame our heads here. He's talking directly about our evolution. That means mankind's
2104400	2111200	evolution. At this stage of our evolution, the concept of competition and survival of the fittest
2111200	2118800	must be abandoned in favor of the concept of cooperation. Oh, hello Carl Marx. Hello all the
2118800	2127520	theosophists. The world future evolution of the Earth and of humanity depends on it. Only
2127520	2134960	cooperation will save the Earth and humanity. From now on, cooperation must be the supreme law of
2134960	2143520	Earth and human survival. We must aim at a united Earth and nature. There's the seed right there
2143520	2148240	for the 17 Sustainable Development Goals and how they operate. And he's not just calling for a global
2148240	2152880	government to be set up through the United Nations and organized in line with extending the 1992 Rio
2152880	2160640	de Janeiro Earth Council Accord, but that it must also direct the, I should say redirect, the mechanisms
2160640	2168080	of evolution of humanity specifically. Never mind the laws of nature. Never mind nature's god. Never
2168080	2174560	mind a biblical god for sure. It is now time for a whole new principle that just so happens to be
2174560	2181840	cooperation, aka communism, but kind of elevated communism, above communism even. And I want to
2181840	2187440	stress this point that this evolution is meant in a spiritual sense. The goal is to change the
2187440	2193680	consciousness of man so that man behaves differently. And through changing consciousness and through
2193680	2200720	changing how we behave, we become new people, a new species, a more advanced species. And in fact,
2200720	2204560	we become a communal species. And that's very important. These evolutionary leaders that I
2204560	2210160	mentioned before that he organized, this is very important because they actually see it that here's
2210160	2214480	the idea. And I'm stealing from Lisa here. So this is going to be a little bit rough. Lisa Logan,
2214480	2219520	again, I am Lisa Logan. You should go follow her. So the general idea is they say, well,
2220080	2226160	look at what you have. You have these bacteria and the bacteria start to make colonies and groups
2226160	2229520	and they group together. This is a real video. She'll show you the real video eventually. There's
2229520	2233840	a real video I've seen of this guy given this lecture. So this isn't us riffing. There's also
2233840	2238560	books explaining this. So the bacteria form, you know, various colonies or whatever. And some of
2238560	2242000	the colonies figure out that if they share resources in certain ways, that they're more
2242000	2247040	successful. And so they can now compete the other ones. So bacteria colonies, which are kind of
2247040	2252800	communities of bacteria do better. And eventually, a thing called a biofilm can form around them so
2252800	2257920	that the colony itself becomes sort of a single entity. And then the various different bacteria
2257920	2262880	within it can specialize to do this or do that or do the other thing for the collective. And then
2262880	2266960	what you end up with is something like an amoeba, you end up with a more complex organism. And that's
2266960	2271760	one step in an evolutionary spiral that happens to look exactly like all the evolutionary hermetic
2271760	2276800	spirals that I've put on Twitter over time, like they literally use the same graphic and
2276800	2281280	outcomes a new species. And this is how evolutionary leaps to higher order creatures,
2281280	2286400	they say are made. And so eventually amoebas form colonies or something that are like amoebas form
2286400	2290640	colonies, and they get a biofilm, and then you have a more complex organism and on and up until
2290640	2294000	you end up with animals, and then you end up with mammals, and then you end up with human beings.
2294000	2298560	And so they think that we're at the stage. And this is the point of their evolutionary idea,
2298560	2304320	where human beings themselves are ready to take the next evolutionary leap into a
2304320	2310880	global collective. And the biofilm, we've already formed communities, but the biofilm that ties us
2310880	2316720	together that makes us all into one thing is the internet. And the internet can be directed so that
2317360	2323440	within all the different communities of people, start to work together for one global program.
2323440	2330080	And so we are meant to become one super organism on the earth. And in fact, in alignment with the earth
2330080	2337920	as part of the earth. And that's what their their idea of evolution is. But to get people to do this,
2337920	2341600	they have to elevate their thinking. In other words, they have to have consciousness
2341600	2346480	raising. In other words, they have to have evolution of consciousness into a global and even as we're
2346480	2351840	going to hear cosmic consciousness, or astral consciousness that goes above that, and can picture
2351840	2358320	humanity operating as a global collective. Again, I urge you to realize that this is the exact same
2358320	2363120	program Karl Marx was was banging on about. Karl just had a different method and a different
2363120	2368640	formulation. But it's the exact same method that we are all the same. We're all the same
2369520	2374480	collective, we're all intrinsically meant to be working together. But only the spiritually
2374480	2379040	advanced what Karl Marx called socialists can actually see it. And here, it's going to be
2379040	2384720	people with cosmic consciousness. And he is dead serious that the purpose of the United Nations
2384720	2390880	going forward is going to be to direct the spiritual evolution of man into a single global
2390880	2400240	collective in a single transformational that is heretical, evil world religion. So let's skip
2400240	2404160	straight to the end and read idea 2000. And we're going to see this is pretty explicit. He says,
2404160	2411280	from our current world pessimism, we can be saved and uplifted by this personal conclusion I arrived
2411280	2419760	at an idea 552. Namely, perhaps out of my passion for life and for this miraculous earth, a new
2419760	2425760	theory of evolution can be shaped. Namely, that with our recently acquired tremendous human
2425760	2431440	knowledge of the universe and of our planet, we will henceforth be more than the mere preservers
2431440	2438080	and savers of the earth, but will be her instruments, her most advanced evolutionary agents, her
2438080	2444720	children endowed with the evolutionary task to make it an even more astonishing planet and cosmic
2444720	2451600	evolutionary success, perhaps the most advanced ultimate masterpiece in the universe and God.
2452720	2457600	Since each species born from nature is a miracle, we are certainly a miracle too.
2457600	2464080	What great excitement it will be when in the year 2000 humanity will accept this as its new,
2464800	2471920	all encompassing common objective for the 21st century to make this earth a paradise,
2471920	2477680	to make humanity a miracle. So I'm not kidding. That's literally what he's about.
2478320	2482000	That's literally the program. So let's make something extremely clear.
2483200	2489360	Going to remind you of a word I already used. An intentional theory of evolution for mankind
2489360	2494080	is eugenics. Let me say that again, because that's what the United Nations through Robert Mueller is
2494080	2498560	advocating for. And like I said, this is the real United Nations, at least in this century,
2498560	2503360	I think maybe all along. I seriously think that, but at least in this century. Let me just say
2503360	2508880	that sentence one more time and I'll say it slowly so it sinks in. An intentional theory of evolution
2508880	2520320	for mankind is eugenics. The call for man to complete God's creation is esoteric occult
2520320	2526640	theosophy. We could talk about whether it's inspired from hermetic ideas. You hear the idea
2526720	2533920	straight up, the Gnostic concept in idea number 2000 here. From our current world pessimism,
2534720	2543680	we can be saved and uplifted by this secret knowledge that we can actually have a
2544560	2549040	directed evolution to become the ultimate masterpiece of the universe and God.
2549600	2557280	So let me make that real clear. This is eugenics. This is the real United Nations and its operating
2557280	2563520	system is a call for man to complete God's creation, which is esoteric occult theosophy.
2564560	2571200	This is, we should have nothing to do with this organization. It is not merely a meeting place
2571200	2575840	for governance to figure out global treaties and things like that. It's nothing of the kind.
2576400	2582720	And he's extremely serious about this and devotes many of his ideas to making this a reality
2582720	2589840	through his vision for a United Nations-centered world government. Let's read 1904. Idea number
2589840	2596240	1904. I recommend that a totally new world organization should be considered for our
2596240	2603120	earth and humanity. A world organization of evolution into which the United Nations could
2603120	2609280	be incorporated. This organization would listen to evolutionary scientists who look at evolution
2609280	2615440	in its multiplicity of forms, from the smallest bacteria to the evolution of humankind,
2615440	2622160	within the basic elements of the planet, its airs, its water, its climate, etc., and who have a long
2622160	2628800	term view, Gnostic, who have a long term view of what the future evolution of this planet is likely to be.
2629120	2634880	This is indispensable because henceforth everything on this planet has to be seen in terms of a long
2634880	2643040	term future evolution. Our species is now in charge of the earth's future evolution. If we stick to
2643040	2651040	obsolete values, we will put an end to it. But if we adopt new values, new objectives, visions,
2651040	2659200	institutions, and laws, evolution will continue. This is henceforth problem number one on this
2659200	2667440	planet. Everything else has to abide to it. It then continues this thought in Idea 1905. The new
2667440	2673600	world organization of evolution would issue yearly reports on the state of evolution of our
2673600	2679680	planet, review the prospects of the future, and recommend corrective actions, including emergency
2680400	2689440	measures and world laws. Idea 1906. The most important single step that could help save the
2689440	2695680	earth and humanity would be to create in each government a ministry of the future, and in the
2695680	2702000	United Nations and in each of its agencies a department and commission of the future. It would
2702000	2708400	be the first step toward the creation of a world organization of evolution. It is good that the
2708480	2714800	European Union had the vision to create a position of commissioner for the future. May this good
2714800	2719520	example be followed by many institutions around the world, public and private.
2722000	2728960	ESG serves that role, by the way, in a slightly different capacity without necessarily a direct
2729760	2735200	department. That's what ESG was designed to do. Besides the redirecting of money and impact
2735200	2743360	investing, ESG was designed to assess the long-term viability in terms of environmental and social
2744480	2754880	programs plus corporate governance practices. Idea 1907. When one considers the vital importance
2754880	2762000	of the future evolution of this planet and of humanity, it would be also important to create
2762080	2768400	a world university of evolution and the future, or at least faculties of evolution and the future
2768400	2774240	in all universities. When I did that episode not that long ago, where I talked about the UNESCO
2774240	2778720	document, it was a series of four, the strange death of the university, where I talked about how
2778720	2783360	the sustainable development goals were to be incorporated completely into university education,
2783360	2790960	ASAP, at all levels. There you go. This stuff is crazy, but it gets way crazier than this. We're
2790960	2797040	not even close to crazy. I'm going to skip to the first part of super crazy. This might be the
2797040	2803600	craziest part. I showed this to Charlie Kirk, and he was just like, what? What? Whoa. Whoa.
2804640	2810640	Overwhelming. It's this freaking crazy. I want my Christian audience to listen very carefully to
2810640	2816080	what this says, because I need you to understand how off the rails the United Nations is and how
2816080	2820720	out of step. Why are they attacking Christianity so hard? You just heard the old values are going
2820800	2824800	to kill the planet. The old beliefs are going to kill the planet. We have to get rid of them.
2824800	2830960	So what does he propose here? It's not just that he intends his vision to be moved by the
2830960	2837520	governments, but very explicitly intends it to be moved by a single new world religion coordinated
2838160	2844160	as an evolutionary religion, that is occult theosophy, headquartered through the United
2844160	2849200	Nations or through a new body that the United Nations is incorporated into. And the goal is to,
2849200	2854320	for him, and I'm not kidding, listen, the goal for him is to envision the United Nations as the
2854320	2860880	body that is tasked with resetting the world. A great reset, right? Resetting the world with a new
2860880	2865840	creation. I mean that because the next thing he talks about, at least that I'm going to tell you
2865840	2870240	about, these are from ideas we were just in the 1900s, we're skipping back to the 1300s,
2871120	2878560	he literally talks about the concept of a United Nations centered new genesis. Genesis is the first
2878560	2885120	book of the Bible. Genesis 1 and 2 describe the creation of the world. If you recall your Genesis
2885120	2889840	1, he talks about the seven days in which God created the world, the six in which he created
2889840	2896240	it and the seventh upon which he saw that it was good and rested. So pulling from ideas 1301 to
2896240	2901920	1400, which he offers in a single block in this document with the heading, the spiritual state of
2901920	2911360	the world, on Earth Day 2013, here's what he writes. Humanity is now a united world community of
2911360	2917840	nations, not only economic and political, but also spiritual. Following the path opened in the last
2917840	2924720	century by Doug Homerskold and by Hugh Taunt in the United Nations, by Robert Schumann in Europe,
2924720	2930960	and also throughout the millennia by prophets and founders of religions and by great sages,
2930960	2940320	such as Plato, Aristotle, Maimonides, Huxley, Albert Schweitzer, Dillard Deschardin, who is an
2940320	2947280	outright hermeticist, Thomas Berry, Bishop William Swing, and others. I'm sure digging into all of
2947280	2952080	those people will uncover that they have very questionable religious beliefs, maybe apart
2952080	2959200	from Aristotle. Humanity's material, scientific and technological, technological feats of the
2959200	2965760	20th century, he says, have been transcended first into the moral ethical realm, then into
2965760	2973040	philanthropy and guiafili, love for humanity and our Earth. That's the key value, by the way,
2973040	2979280	not just of his program, but of the degrowth communism to fix the metabolic rift that Marx
2979280	2982800	predicted. If you go back and listen to the degrowth communism podcast that I did recently,
2982800	2988240	you'll see it's the exact same idea, guiafili, love for humanity and for our Earth. It's all
2988240	2992480	theosophical occultism. Marxism is just a branch of theosophical occultism that had a very
2993200	3000240	powerful success record in installing itself politically. And so he says, sorry, humanities
3000880	3005200	feats of the 20th century have been transcended first into the moral ethical realm, then into
3005200	3011200	philanthropy and guiafili, and finally into the highest form of all the spiritual dimension heralded
3011200	3017280	for so long by all religions, namely the right understanding of our place and relationship
3017360	3024240	in the universe and in time and of our fundamental cosmic nature and role. If you needed more proof
3024240	3032080	that this is occult theosophy, I don't know what to tell you, but he's invoking the underlying
3032640	3037840	hermetic concept of the priesthood theologiae there, that there is this ancient world religion,
3037840	3043840	that all sciences, all thought, all cultures, all religions, all everything are just reflections
3043840	3048080	of. Hinduism is just doing the best it can, just like quantum physics is doing the best it can,
3048080	3054000	to explain this one true thing about all of reality. And he thinks that we've now hit the
3054000	3060960	point where we can actually start to articulate that. The phenomenal expansion of human senses
3060960	3065840	and physical capabilities through science and technology was followed by the birth and development
3065840	3072960	of a global brain, a global nervous system, a global heart, and a global soul to humanity.
3073040	3079120	So Hegel's geist. Much remains to be done to perfect and refine these gains and to integrate
3079120	3085200	them fully into the total life system of our living planet, skipping a bit. We came to understand
3085200	3091520	that we are all part of a total living planet which is itself a cosmic body of the universe,
3092240	3097680	and that in this living system we are linked not only to the earth but to each other and to the
3097680	3102640	heavens in which we live. The miraculous transformation we have experienced in the
3102640	3108960	progress of humanity is a result of our cooperation of the world's religions along the lines of the
3108960	3115120	vast frameworks of our knowledge and our needed actions born in the United Nations and its agencies.
3115760	3121040	So let's be real clear. He's saying that everything is all one, that's the occult
3121040	3126160	theosophical view, and that it's actually coming together through the United Nations and its agencies.
3127040	3131600	These led to a better understanding of our planet and place in the universe of our
3131600	3138000	total human family, of our place in time, and of the miracle of individual human life.
3138640	3143040	The last decades of the 20th century provided humanity with the global information
3144000	3150560	and first experiences indispensable for our better behavior, for better earth government,
3150560	3155760	and for the physical, mental, moral, effective, and spiritual fulfillment of all humans
3156320	3163040	blessed with the miracle of life. So we're going to skip a few grandiose paragraphs with
3163040	3168320	fancy grandiose headings about the unique role of humans in place and time, and we're going to
3168320	3171920	skip down to one of his subject headings, it's titled the miracle of individual life.
3173360	3177360	This fourth framework, so you can guess that we skipped three, this fourth framework which
3177360	3183120	revolves around the centrality of the human person goes far deeper and beyond human institutions.
3183120	3188560	It has become increasingly clear that in the vast global quantum change in human consciousness,
3188560	3193520	so does that sound like Deepak Chopra? It does. Why? Because he's one of them. He's actually
3193520	3198240	a very important figure, he's one of them. You know about the evolutionary leaders and people
3198240	3204080	like Deepak Chopra? Because Oprah Winfrey put them on TV all the time, dozens of times, over and over
3204320	3211440	again and mainline them into our culture. It has become increasingly clear that in the vast
3211440	3217280	global quantum change in human consciousness, individuals are the alpha and omega. Oh, we're
3217280	3225920	God, okay. The basic living cosmic units of evolution. Individual, what? Don't all biological
3225920	3232480	things evolve on the theory of evolution? But no, human beings, human consciousness,
3233680	3240240	individuals. Individual human life is the highest form of universal consciousness. This is just the
3240240	3244400	theosophical belief set that we are the unique creature that's able to figure out where the
3244400	3249280	divine has been fragmented so that we can lead God to realize himself so that we eventually,
3249280	3254240	God realizes that we are no different from one another or anything else and in fact that we
3254240	3259920	are always God. That's literally it. Individual human life is the highest form of universal
3259920	3265520	consciousness. With the recognition of universal human rights and responsibilities, it became apparent
3265520	3272000	that institution systems, states, groupings, entities had no consciousness and could only be
3272000	3277440	instruments, servants, means for the increase of individual consciousness, fulfillment and
3277520	3284800	responsibility. The highest goal for humankind is to attain optimum physical, mental, effective,
3285360	3291280	moral, and spiritual lives as a part of the total life system of our planet.
3292640	3298000	So are you getting the idea that this is a super crackpot religion? It is. Optimum physical life
3298000	3303360	involves knowledge and care of the human body, the human ability to see, to hear, to observe,
3303360	3310560	to create, to do, to act, to transform, and the expansion of all senses and physical abilities.
3311440	3315840	That's, there you go. Optimum meant that, by the way, Karl Marx says the same thing in the
3315840	3320000	Economic Philosophic Manuscript, by the way, by the way, he says the exact same thing. It's the
3320000	3326000	exact same theosophical nonsense and I think that Karl Marx stole it from the Corpus Hermaticum.
3326800	3332720	It's way too weird that it's in there in Karl Marx's Economic Philosophic Manuscripts and that
3332800	3338160	it's so closely paralleled to stuff that's in the Corpus Hermaticum, which is the ancient
3338160	3344560	Hermatic religious text, which by the way has 17 books. The 17s just keep coming up. I'm just saying
3344560	3348720	this is exactly the same thing that's expressed there and it's not because this guy's a Marxist,
3348720	3355120	it's because Marx was one of them. It's that they are all theosophical occultists who think that
3355120	3362160	they have the secret knowledge and the divine right to transform man to complete creation.
3363280	3367440	They're the alpha and the, man is the alpha and the omega, the beginning and the end, the creator
3367440	3373600	and the conclusion. He says, optimal mental life involves knowledge and education,
3373600	3378880	which of course they took control of, the ability to question, to think, to analyze, to synthesize,
3380480	3386640	to synthesize, to conclude, to communicate, the ability to focus from the infinitely small to
3386640	3390800	the infinitely large, from the local to the global, from the past to the future,
3390800	3397120	to be what Hinduism calls trickledarshish, sorry, I can't say it, I don't know, omniscient,
3398080	3404720	particularly all knowing across time, past, present and future, and tricholanaths,
3405280	3412800	which is omnipotence, mastery of the three worlds. Optimum, effective and moral life
3412800	3418000	involves the ability to love and the human virtues of truth, understanding, humility,
3418000	3424560	liberty, responsibility, reverence for life, compassion, altruism and charity. And finally,
3424560	3431120	optimum spiritual life involves the ability for interiority, meditation, prayer, communion with
3431120	3439840	the universe and eternity and with God. Here, the United Nations, the United Religions, UNESCO
3439840	3445600	and other world agencies stand today in the forefront of human progress and evolution,
3446240	3452720	in the education, information, enlightened democracy, transcendence, and fulfillment of the
3452720	3459440	miracle of human life and its contribution and responsibility in the overall cosmic evolution
3459440	3468320	of our planet and of the universe. We have a role in the evolution of the universe, like this is the
3468320	3475040	most ridiculous, but it's just a cult theosophy, you've got to understand, you may not even know
3475040	3479520	the word theosophy yet, you need to know the word theosophy because the spiritual war that
3479520	3486240	we're in right now is theosophy versus theology. Theology is a serious pursuit of religious truth
3486240	3496400	and theosophy is a cult. I was going to say it's an occult cult, which sounds stupid so that's why
3496400	3502080	I stalled out there, but that's what it is, it's a cult based on occult beliefs. He says this is
3502080	3506240	where we stand at the moment, in the year 2013, I don't know how this is in a document delivered
3506240	3511200	in 1999, I don't know if it was added later, that's beside the point, it's in the freaking
3511200	3515840	document, you can go look at it, I can show you the page numbers, he must have added to this
3515840	3520720	and cobbled it together later as a kind of grouping of things that he thinks. But anyway,
3520720	3525680	this is where we stand at the moment in the year 2013, 20 years after the second world parliament
3525680	3531920	of religions. It represents a unique, tremendous quantum jump in consciousness and evolution of
3531920	3538960	humanity. We know our planet inside out and we are now in charge of its future. That seems very
3539760	3546480	taking on playing God. We even know a good part of the heavens, we have entered the cosmic age
3546480	3551600	of our evolution. So skipping more of this waffle, because I want to get to the scary stuff.
3552240	3556080	Similarly, the pragmatic efforts of the religions and of the united religions,
3556080	3562080	that's an organization by the way, are complemented by a world spirituality university,
3562080	3567600	which has developed a science of spirituality, and Alice Bailey called it the science of
3567600	3574080	right human relations. A strategy for spirituality and a methodology of spirituality derived from
3574080	3579440	all religious practices, celebrations and rites around the world, aimed at the spiritual fulfillment
3579440	3586480	and responsibility of human beings. As a result, the world is in a new period of full flowering
3586480	3592480	spiritual renaissance, far beyond inter-religious dialogue. Remember, that's what he called for
3592480	3598880	back in 1999, and here it is in 2013, saying that we're there. Based on the common spirituality
3598880	3604400	of all religions and on a common denominator of all human beings, the yearning for answers to the
3604400	3611360	mysteries of life and death and of our universe, to which the scientific age, despite its amazing
3611360	3621680	advances, was unable to find satisfying answers. The age of scientific analysis and dissection,
3621680	3627280	our checkered history of local cultures and national divisions, the millennia of religious
3627280	3632720	dissections and of the spiritual nature of humanity, of the earth and of the cosmos,
3632720	3639920	have now led to a new age of universality, holism, evolutionism, and all-encompassing
3639920	3646240	convergence, synthesis, synergy, and transcendence. That sounds like some Antichrist stuff,
3647040	3651120	so I'm skipping a lot more after a bunch of bullet points for what this world might look like in
3651120	3656320	practice, which probably I should cover, but this is going to be super long anyway. He says,
3656400	3663600	at that point I looked up from the text, so he's working on laying out what this should look like.
3663600	3668320	At that point I looked up from the text and seized a copy of a book I had written many years ago in
3668320	3673840	the last century, meaning in the 90s, when I was a young world servant, I don't know if it's in the
3673840	3678720	90s, so before 2000 I should say, when I was a young world servant of the United Nations,
3679440	3687520	entitled New Genesis, Shaping a Global Spirituality, and read the following text of mine. So this is
3687520	3694080	the vision that was guiding his thought from very early on in his world servant capacity at the
3694080	3704560	United Nations. He said, he wrote, and God saw all the nations of the earth, black and white,
3704560	3710480	poor and rich, from north and south, from east and west, and all of the creeds were sending
3710480	3716240	their emissaries to a tall glass house on the shores of the river of the rising sun, on the
3716240	3722720	island of Manhattan, to study together, to think together, and to care together for the world and
3722720	3730080	all its people, and God said, that is good. And it was the first day of the new era of the earth.
3731040	3739120	Pause. Where is the glass house on the, a tall glass house on the shores of the river of the
3739120	3746560	rising sun on the island of Manhattan? Hmm, is it the United Nations building? It is. So let's
3746560	3754960	phrase it more, more straightly. And God saw that all the nations of the earth, and all its people,
3755120	3761280	from all its creeds, were sending their emissaries to the United Nations building
3761920	3766480	to study together, to think together, and care together for this world and all of its people,
3766480	3773520	and God said, that is good. And it was the first day of the new era of the earth.
3774320	3781600	This is the United Nations. This is the UN. Time to abolish the UN. But he's not done.
3782480	3787360	And God saw that soldiers of peace were separating the combatants of quarreling nations.
3788080	3793600	So that's their blue hats, that differences were being resolved by negotiation and reason instead
3793600	3799280	of arms, and that leaders of nations were seeing each other, taking to each other and joining
3799280	3805920	their hearts, minds, souls, and strength, that's a reference to Jesus, the Gospels, for the benefit
3805920	3812880	of all humanity. And God said, that is good. And it was the second day of the planet of peace.
3813840	3820480	So he just compared the blue hats to Jesus' disciples by the way. And God saw that humans
3820480	3826000	were loving the entire creation, the stars and the sun, the day and the night, the air and the
3826000	3831680	oceans, the earth and the waters, the fishes and the fowl, the flowers and the herbs, and all their
3831680	3838560	human brethren and sisters. And God said, that is good. And it was the third day of the planet
3838560	3845200	of happiness. And God saw that humans were suppressing hunger, disease, ignorance, and
3845200	3851280	suffering all over the globe, providing each human person with a decent, conscious, and happy life,
3851280	3857680	no discontious, and reducing the greed, the power, and the wealth of the few. And he said, that is
3857680	3865600	good. And it was the fourth day of the planet of justice. And God saw that humans were living in
3865600	3871200	harmony with their planet and in peace with one another, wisely managing their resources, avoiding
3871200	3880000	waste, curbing excesses, replacing hatred with love, greed with contentment, arrogance with humility,
3880000	3885920	division with cooperation, and mistrust with understanding. And he said, that is good. And
3886000	3891600	it was the fifth day of the golden planet. And God saw that men were destroying their arms,
3891600	3896560	bombs, missiles, warships, and warplanes, dismantling their bases and disbanding their armies,
3896560	3901600	keeping only policemen of peace to protect the good from the bad and the normal from the mad.
3901600	3909840	And God said, that is good. And it was the sixth day of the planet of reason. And God saw humans
3909840	3919760	restore God. And God saw humans restore God and the human person as the Alpha and Omega. And God
3919760	3927280	saw humans restore God and the human person as the Alpha and Omega, reducing institutions, beliefs,
3927280	3933440	politics, governments, and all manmade entities to mere servants of God and the people. And he saw
3933440	3938560	them adopt as their supreme law. You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, all your
3938560	3943040	soul, all your mind, and all your strength. You shall love your neighbor as yourself. There is
3943040	3948880	no greater commandment than these. And God said, that is good. And it was the seventh day of the
3948880	3956160	planet of God. I let the book rest on my lap and looked around me at the magnificent divine nature
3956160	3965440	of the sacred Mount Ressur and addressed these words of thanks to God. Thank you, dear Lord,
3965520	3972960	for having fulfilled my dream. And I seized my harmonica and played on it the ode to joy of
3972960	3978240	Beethoven. So it turns out this harmonica thing, that's the end of the page, this harmonica thing
3978240	3983280	actually happened. I kind of meant to play it for you. Maybe we can work this thing in. I'm not 100
3983280	3987760	percent sure. Maybe I'll work in the sound so you can actually hear that it wasn't Robert Mueller,
3987760	3994240	but somebody else played the harmonica in the United Nations and played ode to joy. And what
3994240	4000800	that means is they knew that this was happening. So hopefully we'll cut this in. Dear colleagues,
4000800	4007840	these are our last decisions in this mandate. And I would like to thank you for five years of unity
4007840	4015920	in diversity. It is our responsibility to keep Europe together and let rebuild Notre Dame and
4015920	4029600	Happy Easter.
4046080	4057520	But that's certainly something, isn't it? Something very heretical.
4058560	4063680	So how is it all supposed to work? Let's go back to his ideas. So now we know what they're up to,
4063680	4068480	a new genesis, a new recreated world, a new recreation of life, where God works on all
4068480	4074480	seven days, by the way, and in which the United Nations is a tall house of glass that is where
4074480	4080720	God says that it all comes from. Isn't that great? So evil. And how is it supposed to work? Well,
4080720	4088880	let's listen. Idea 1382 from the 23rd of April, 1998. Like the capitalists and communists did
4088880	4094400	at the end of the last century, we should think hard and conceive how we can make the next century
4094400	4100800	a paradise, since both communism and capitalism have failed. And since we live in planetary
4100800	4106240	conditions very different from those at the end of the last century, we must think afresh all of
4106240	4112960	our current beliefs, doings, and institutions, and formulate an entirely new ideology or dreamology
4113680	4119840	for an unprecedented future in all human history. Heads of governments, of corporations,
4119840	4126000	and of all human institutions should be excited by this new, wonderful challenge. And what should
4126240	4134480	challenge solve? Idea 1343, 15 March, 1998. Humanity has achieved so much progress,
4134480	4140000	has solved so many problems, avoided so many dangers, and yet now we face the most colossal
4140000	4146080	problem in the entire human history and evolution, namely that industry, technology, commerce,
4146080	4152720	transport, overpopulation, and overconsumption might destroy the very essence and future of the
4152720	4161600	earth, including our own, namely, its nature. We need innumerable great and small ideas and
4161600	4167200	efforts to countervail that. But there's a huge problem in this idea, and that huge problem is
4167200	4177200	called the United States of America. Idea 1338, 10 March, 1998. From an evolutionary point of view,
4177200	4183200	the attacks of the United States against the United Nations and reduction of its roles and means,
4183200	4188480	in other words, we were pushing away from the UN and defunding it, will be considered some day
4188480	4196160	as one of the greatest errors and lacks of vision in world history. It seems that power went so much
4196160	4201920	to the head of the United States that it lost its sense of proportions and direction. Therefore,
4201920	4208240	the United States will decline as a power, as did all past powers which did not adapt to new
4208240	4214160	fundamental trends of evolution. This happens regrettably on the eve of a new century and millennium
4214160	4219120	when all countries, especially the best informed ones, should have the clearest possible mind,
4219120	4225440	views, and heart toward a future written in the stars. We must deeply mourn the fact that the
4225440	4231040	United States has lost its consciousness of the world's future and of its guiding role in it.
4231600	4237680	So what's wrong with the United States? It's powerful enough to be sovereign and to reject
4237680	4243280	this theosophy in favor of individual rights and liberties instead of a crackpot world cult.
4245200	4250720	What's happened since? Much of what has transpired in the 20th century, especially since about
4250720	4257760	2015, has been actually all the way through, starting in 2001, September 11th. 2001, much
4257760	4262800	of what has transpired in the 21st century, has been a direct attack on the United States for
4262800	4269440	this rejection of the United Nations theosophical ambitions, exactly like Robert Mueller said would
4269440	4277440	have to be the case. The United States will have to decline as a power because it's not in line with
4277440	4282880	their evolutionary agendas. The United States had its run but it's not going along with the
4282880	4290320	program sufficiently so they're going to have to let it fall. That seems to be very in line with
4290320	4295280	their program. So the United States should have absolutely nothing to do with this organization.
4295280	4300640	It should renew its attacks, it should renew its distance, and it should completely defund
4300640	4306400	this evil organization. So then there's another big section based on another block of 100,
4307040	4313360	based on ideas 1401 through 1500, and it's even crazier than this new genesis idea that really
4313360	4318320	sets the stage for what they want. It calls for a global association of scientists and thinkers
4318320	4326320	concerned with long-range evolution. Now this is an excerpt added in by Erica Erdman in her interim
4326320	4332720	report published in November of 1997, and it starts off with a quote from so-called quote
4332720	4338480	Space Scientist. Eric Chison, I don't think I said his last name right but you whatever.
4339520	4344720	The quote says implicit within our cosmic evolutionary paradigm is a transcendence of
4344720	4350320	the Darwinian principle of natural selection, a loftier standard that I call the principle
4350320	4355760	of cosmic selection. Those technological civilizations of any type on any planet that
4355760	4362240	recognize the need for development time and fully embrace a global ethics will survive in those
4362240	4366480	that do not will not. Okay, so let's be real clear about something here.
4367360	4371920	So my Christian buddies, I need you to listen. When Darwin talked about evolution,
4371920	4376480	these people reject that. That is not what they're talking about. They are in fact, remember he said
4376480	4380800	they were going to reject survival of the fittest. We're going to reject competition. That's what
4380800	4385760	Darwin's ideas were based off of. That is not what they're advocating. They are not advocating for
4385760	4392880	Darwinism. They're advocating for directed cosmic evolution. And the claim is that cosmic selection
4392880	4400320	is the only planetary civilizations that survive are ones that adopt global ethics. What does that
4400320	4407840	mean? And fully adopt, not just adopt, not just adopt it, but fully embrace global ethics. That
4407840	4413360	means global cooperation. That means something like the vision of communism. That means the
4413360	4418880	theosophical endpoint where we are all one. So if you don't adopt their theosophical occult views
4418880	4423920	of what humanity is supposed to be, they believe that there's a pressure that all such civilizations
4423920	4432240	will eventually go extinct and will not survive in the grand scheme of cosmic selection, which by
4432240	4441360	the way is not real. That is not a theory by which anything is said to say, speciate or differentiate
4442000	4448320	persist through time. But that's where it begins. So then we go back to Erica here and she comments
4448320	4455120	and says his insight into global problems and his vast perspective led Dr. Robert Muller,
4455120	4461040	Chancellor Emeritus of the University for Peace in Costa Rica and former Assistant Secretary General
4461040	4466080	of the United Nations to call for a UNESCO backed summit meeting of the world's scientists and
4466080	4471680	thinkers concerned with the long term fate of our earth and of humanity, which is endangered by
4471680	4477840	blind pursuit of short term goals. He envisions an exchange of knowledge and ideas among the most
4477840	4484960	conscientious person on the planet, leading to advances in human wisdom that could not otherwise
4484960	4491280	occur. And that would initiate a permanent shift toward a more future oriented responsible attitude
4491920	4496240	worldwide. So this global ethic
4498320	4504480	supposed to be backed by these ideas that replace blind pursuit of short term goals.
4505040	4513360	Again, ESG came in in 2003 to start pushing us in that direction from where? United Nations.
4513360	4520160	Comprehensive sexuality education to, I guess, adopt a new global ethic was developed at UNESCO
4520160	4524400	in 2003. All straight downstream from these ideas.
4526320	4532160	So the objective, they state, the importance and urgency of the project lies in the need for a
4532160	4538560	transformation of past inspired ethics with their many contradictions. Fundamentalist shackles
4538560	4544960	and mutual hatreds to a future oriented ethic in which all of humanity can unite in a striving
4545920	4551040	to become more enlightened and more humane. Apparently, we got to take down the US first.
4552000	4557440	Many scientists believe that the universe is dominated by a quote cosmic principle of self
4557440	4563280	destruction, a universal law that destroys any civilization in the universe, which has achieved
4563280	4568720	a level of intelligence and technical capacity similar to our own. I don't know who these many
4568720	4574400	scientists are, because intelligence is not the result of the fiercest competition during the
4574400	4579600	process of evolution, they argue, our brains cannot possibly conceive of an alternative
4579600	4585920	that would avert our fate. Other scientists see in the process of evolution a forward march,
4585920	4591360	not toward more destructive competition, but toward more foresight, insight, wisdom, and love.
4592080	4596400	These persons, most of whom are inspired by the teachings of Teilhard de Chardin,
4596400	4598800	who I mentioned earlier is one of the hermeticists,
4599360	4605280	believe that the trend from the material to the spiritual, from the amoeba to man,
4605280	4608240	I told you there's this other video and then they mentioned it here,
4608240	4613040	will inevitably be continued toward superior heights of love and wisdom. Now this was written
4613040	4620160	in 1997, the amoeba to man thing video that I mentioned was much later, it's much more recent,
4620160	4625600	so they've been thinking this for a long time, but this trend from the material to spiritual,
4625600	4630800	from the amoeba to man, will inevitably be continued toward superior heights of love and
4630800	4636800	wisdom, however threatening present developments on earth may appear to us now. Skipping down a bit,
4637360	4642800	an association of scientists concerned with long range evolution would help to sort these
4642800	4648560	contradictions out, and to align and attract thinkers and scientists toward a superior goal.
4648560	4653680	It is urgently needed to show the pessimists that alternatives to competition until death
4654160	4660560	do exist, even in non-human nature but especially in human nature. To show the optimists that
4660560	4666800	reliance on non-human determination of our fate might weaken our sense of personal responsibility
4666800	4672800	for our descendants and our earth, and to impress upon the majority the importance of a long range
4672800	4679200	and encompassing vision to guide our choices. Hello ESG. And then they put in bold, a whole
4679200	4685680	paragraph in bold, what unites us is a look at the miracle of evolution from a cosmic perspective,
4686640	4693440	a non-stick perspective guys. It is the effort to prevent our species from becoming another dead
4693440	4700240	end bypassed by ongoing development of life. It is a search for principles and values guiding
4700240	4709120	humanity toward further ascent. So we got to spiritually evolve the entire species. And what
4709120	4713680	in the world is this based on? Where did they get these crazy ideas about oh no everything's
4713680	4718720	going to be bad, we're going to destroy ourselves, every civilization of our kind at our level of
4718720	4723680	advancement or whatever destroys itself. And I mean on a planetary sense, I don't mean like the
4723680	4729760	fall of Rome, I mean like everybody goes extinct, the whole thing falls apart. So what is this all
4729760	4735440	based on? Aside from some weird book that they do mention of questionable worth about cosmic
4735440	4740080	evolution and some quote from a space scientist. The book about cosmic evolution by the way,
4740080	4745840	is taken to be the impetus for what I just read. But it turns out that underneath all this are the
4746400	4751120	neo-malthusian ideas of the club of Rome and the limits to growth. You remember when I talked
4751120	4756880	about the limits to growth? Now these guys thought that the world was going to outstrip,
4756880	4760320	the humans were going to outstrip the world's resources and we would all have a population
4760320	4765600	collapse. And the whole degrowth premise, the whole depopulation premise that we have to
4765600	4770560	keep putting on the table is all because they believe what was written in the club of Rome in
4770560	4777440	1971 or two in the book that they published limits to growth, which turned out to make
4777440	4781680	lots of predictions for the year 2000 that we're all wrong. Turns out that's their inspiration.
4781680	4786560	Here's what they write. Professor D.H. Meadows from the United States is a System Analyst
4786560	4793200	and Journalist. Professor of Systems Management D.L. Meadows from the U.S. is Director of the
4793200	4798560	Institute for Policy and Social Science Research and Professor J. Randers is a Policy Analyst
4798560	4803440	and President Emeritus of the Norwegian School of Management, Chairman of the Norwegian Bank of
4803440	4808800	Industry, Norwegian Institute for Market Research and Deputy Director General of the World Wildlife
4808800	4812640	Fund, which by the way is, if you didn't know that the World Wildlife Fund is really part of this
4812640	4818640	whole global agenda big time, well it is. And here's why. In fact, it was probably created as such.
4818640	4823360	I don't know for sure. All three authors collaborated on the pathbreaking book,
4823360	4829120	The Limits to Growth, published 20 years ago. Their present book, Beyond the Limits from 1992,
4830240	4835280	also provides such clear convincing and well documented information about our present world
4835280	4840880	and the dangers of rapid uncontrolled growth that it is difficult to imagine how it could fail to
4840880	4847360	have an immense impact. Growth is defined as material resource consuming advance only,
4847360	4853680	while all other growth is called development. The authors however see no indication that people
4853680	4859440	are reasonable enough to reverse their lifestyles in time. Once overshoot becomes evident,
4859440	4864720	moreover in most cases it will be too late once depletion is clearly visible. So these people
4864720	4869680	are going to save the world from itself in line with the Limits to Growth Club of Rome stuff.
4869680	4874640	And remember the World Economic Forum guys, Klaus Schwab in particular, invited these exact same
4874640	4881760	people from the Club of Rome to speak at the World Economic Forum in its second year of existing
4881760	4888560	way back in the 1970s. So this is this is the idea behind almost all of this. So almost all
4888640	4893280	crackpot faiths and real faiths both present two alternatives, heaven and hell.
4894320	4899200	We know what that looks like in Christianity, for example. What we can also see what it looks like
4900320	4904160	from Herbert Marcuse. He says that we're either going to have communism or liberation,
4904160	4907840	I should say, or we're going to have fascism. So we have heaven or hell. Those are our two choices.
4907840	4915440	And here the evolutionary new thought, Gnostic new thought of the United Nations,
4915440	4920240	which is rooted down in this idea of sustainability and inclusion, presents us heaven and hell.
4920240	4927680	We're either going to degrow to a utopian circular economy intentionally and intelligently under
4927680	4933280	their global management with their new global faith heaven. Or what we're going to do is we're
4933280	4937680	going to collapse our world. We're going to have massive over massive depletion that becomes a
4937680	4944080	downwards vicious circle that destroys the capacity for life on the planet. And then we all die.
4944080	4950160	So it's the same, same, same structure. So that's this crazy setup. But let's skip down a little
4950160	4957040	further. Read idea 1433, which he wrote the 13th of June 1998. He says we urgently need as we enter
4957040	4962640	a new century and millennium, a world conference to appraise the present state of evolution on this
4962640	4969040	planet and to provide worldviews on future evolution in the next century and millennium.
4969040	4976640	After humanism, after the environment, after the earth, now future evolution has become priority
4976640	4986640	number one. Idea 1499, 18 August 1998. After communism and capitalism, frugalism, which is
4986640	4992960	degrowth, they just didn't have the word to use in 98. After communism and capitalism,
4992960	4998560	frugalism might become the new ideology and rule of our behavior on earth, demanding from us
4998560	5005120	more frugal and simple lives in order not to destroy life giving nature. A new economic system
5005120	5011840	must be born, which will not produce colossal waste on necessary products built in rapid
5011840	5019920	obsolescence and colossal duplications between 185 nations. That's exactly the argument of Herbert
5019920	5026960	Marcuse and one dimensional man. Frugalism and simplicity of life might become the salvation
5026960	5033040	of the earth and future generations. It's also the argument of the degrowth capitalism or degrowth
5033040	5037600	communism book, I'm sorry, Marcuse and the Anthropocene that I covered in another episode of the
5037600	5042400	podcast. This is their agenda. This is how they think. So degrowth is going to be the way to save
5042400	5052800	the world. Idea 1510, 29th August 1998. We must deeply rethink our world's and humanity's future.
5052800	5059040	It would be good to remember the fathers of the U.S. Constitution. How dare you? It would be good
5059040	5063680	to remember the fathers of the U.S. Constitution who believed that the function of good government
5063680	5068560	was to, quote, affect the greatest happiness of the greatest number of citizens and to affect
5068560	5076320	harmony between the public and private interests, end quote. Today they would add, get their motherfucking
5076320	5082960	names out of your mouth. Today they would add harmony with the earth in a worldwide dimension
5082960	5095920	to the attaining of happiness. No, they wouldn't. You dickhead. Idea 1557, 15th October 1998. Speaking
5095920	5103040	of identities, we should accept happily that we have a polyidentity. Our specific individual
5103040	5108640	identity, a family identity, a local identity, a provincial identity, a national identity,
5108640	5116560	a continental identity, a world identity, a cosmic identity, and eternal identity. The future earth
5116560	5123440	and human government of this planet should take all of these diverse identities into account.
5124720	5130480	It gets much worse in the next section based on ideas 1601 to 1700.
5131360	5138080	This is where, like, New Genesis was pretty crazy and totally blasphemous. This is where the
5138080	5143120	idea is actually getting nut job because it's his cosmological vision of the future.
5144720	5148400	And I'm going to try to just, I have to read a lot of it and I'll try to just kind of slide
5148400	5153120	through it as quickly as we can. I will try, this is Robert Mueller, I will try to condense
5153120	5159360	briefly my thoughts on a cosmic vision of humanity's future. First of all, the most important factor
5159360	5165760	determining our time is that in the entire human evolution on this planet, within the
5165760	5170720	last couple of centuries and especially during the last 50 years, the human race has been able
5170720	5177120	to extend its knowledge of this planet and of itself in such incredible ways that a profound
5177120	5184240	transformation has taken place in evolution. This is the talk of eugenicists, guys. We now
5184240	5190320	understand the mysteries of life, the mysteries of humans, the mysteries of the planet and the
5190320	5196080	cosmos and now we can direct it because we understand it. We can take it into our hands,
5196080	5201600	we can seize the means of production of man. He says, this knowledge has meant incredible
5201600	5207760	benefits for humanity and I skip his big laundry list of them. The fundamental fact that we know
5207760	5213840	our planet, that we know humanity, that we know how to analyze and recompose matter has produced
5213840	5219440	miracles. Of course, we believed that the progress of science and technology was for the benefit of
5219440	5224240	humanity. In other words, that our reason for being on this planet was to get the best for
5224240	5232000	ourselves. This is the great humanistic age in which we are now living. But we did not know
5232000	5237920	that these great advances would also result in a whole series of crises due to our global ignorance.
5238880	5243040	Who ever thought of saving energy? Who ever thought of the ozoneosphere?
5243040	5248720	Who ever thought of possible climactic changes? Who ever thought of the long-term genetic dangers
5248720	5254320	of nuclear radiation and radio waves? I am asking this question today. What are the things we are
5254320	5259920	doing today which we think are wonderful and in which in 20 years from now we'll have the same or
5259920	5265280	worse adverse effects as a few examples I mentioned? Who is thinking of this? Who is
5265360	5271040	heeding the Iroquois precept that we should think of the effects on the seventh generation?
5271040	5276000	We do not even think of the next generation. There is not a single ministry of the future
5276000	5281200	on this planet. Yikes. And I will point out that he actually in lots and lots and lots of the ideas
5281200	5285920	invokes the idea that we need to go back to indigenous, especially American Indian,
5286560	5292720	knowledges and epistemologies that comes up over and over and over again. I don't actually include
5292800	5297840	any of them I think except for that mention, but it's not like a throw in here. It's like over
5297840	5303120	and over and over again. Indigenous knowledges are the only way. Why? Because they are the model
5303120	5308880	for communism. Remember Marx's model of communism? Communism is a global state where we all act like
5308880	5316160	a big tribal family. That's why. Now skipping down some of this, so we can get to the crazy stuff,
5316160	5320800	of late there has been another fundamental change on earth. Until now we thought that
5320800	5325920	this planet was at our disposal, that it was created for us. Uh-oh Christians, there's your
5325920	5330720	beliefs. That it was here for us to exploit and develop endlessly. I think the word in the Bible
5330720	5337680	is subdued. Well, we are now in the middle of another Copernican revolution. We thought at
5337680	5342480	the time that the sun was turning around the earth until we learned from Copernicus that it was not
5342480	5350640	true. Now we're learning that perhaps this planet has not been created for humans, but that humans
5350640	5356640	have been created for the planet. Uh-oh, there's your earth worshipping Gnostic,
5358560	5364000	Gnostic theosophy. We return to the earth, he says, as our American Indians and the great
5364000	5370240	religions have all told us. Thus we are temporary living manifestations or incarnations of this
5370240	5376320	earth. Again, the American Indians tell us we are children of the earth and we must take good care
5376320	5383520	of our mother and respect her. We are living earth. Each of us is a cell, a perceptive,
5383520	5390000	nervous, active unit of the earth. We are earth alive and are beginning to be concerned about
5390000	5396480	the earth. The living consciousness of the earth is beginning to operate through us. All over the
5396480	5404080	world a kind of earth democracy, a gyrocracy is taking shape. What you're witnessing is the birth
5404080	5412560	of a new pagan cult, by the way. You, as cosmic and earth cells, are part of a vast biological
5412560	5418480	and evolutionary phenomenon which is of first importance at this stage, namely humanity as a
5418480	5424560	whole. The whole human species is becoming the brain, the heart, the soul, the expression, and
5424560	5432400	the action of the earth. Pause. Let's talk about Karl Marx, right? Remember when he said that the
5432480	5438320	earth is man's inorganic body and that the point of part of our activity is that as we
5438320	5442000	rehumanize ourselves, we're going to humanize the world and make the world fit for human
5443520	5448480	habitation. So we're supposed to turn the earth, we're supposed to basically integrate the earth
5448480	5452480	into ourselves and ourselves into the earth so that it were one symbiotic thing and that would
5452480	5456960	of course avoid the metabolic rift the capitalism's going to produce and the whole point of degrowth
5456960	5461680	which is the whole point of the concepts of the club of Rome that I just talked about and limits
5461680	5468320	to growth. So the whole human species, as a species being, namely humanity as a whole, the whole
5468320	5473440	human species, as a species being is becoming the brain, the heart, the soul, the expression,
5473440	5480160	and the action of the earth. We now have a global brain which determines what can be dangerous
5480160	5486160	or mortal for this planet. Yeah, and limits to growth, it was shitty computer models that he
5486160	5491920	literally talks about. It's like the shitty computer models of COVID but go back to like
5491920	5497040	1971 and imagine how shitty those computer models would be because that's what it literally,
5497040	5500880	that's their global brain, is shitty computer models. But what that means is AI is a future
5500880	5506640	global brain and it can determine what can be dangerous or mortal for this planet. The United
5506640	5511920	Nations, what does he say is a colon here? What is the global brain according to Robert Mueller
5511920	5517600	writing in 1998? We have a global brain which can which determines what can be dangerous or
5517600	5523760	mortal for this planet and it is the United Nations and its agencies, the innumerable groups and
5523760	5531200	networks around the world are part of this brain. We are a world heart. Altruism, which we haven't
5531200	5538160	covered altruism in Augusta Comte yet but that's another bad philosophy. Altruism, the concern
5538160	5545120	of people to be of help, the live aid and international programs, etc. All of this is a
5545120	5551840	manifestation of the fact that on this planet after having evolved from protozoas to metazoas,
5551840	5560640	we are now becoming what one would call terrazoas. We are living Earth that is beginning to be
5560640	5566400	conscious of its role in the evolution of this particular planet in the universe. This is our
5566400	5574720	newly discovered meaning, birth of a cult. It is happening every day and we have to draw the
5574720	5580000	right conclusions from it. The world is changing very fundamentally in terms of consciousness,
5580000	5586640	behavior and action. We know that we are a global family living in a global home. This is more or
5586640	5592720	less where we stand. In other words, we are in the process of becoming a global civilization
5592720	5598400	and yet this is not all there is more to come. Beyond our global consciousness, we are moving
5598400	5604080	into a cosmic consciousness. Remember this is a guy that created Common Core just in case you forgot
5604080	5611120	that. In other words, we learn to see the Earth process not only as a global planetary process
5611120	5617520	but as a cosmic manifestation and evolution on a given planet in the universe. It is not impossible
5617520	5623920	that the universe has not been able to produce many live planets like ours. We are at the right
5623920	5629200	distance from a sun. We have the right mass to retain an atmosphere and water and we are very
5629200	5635040	lucky that the force that keeps atoms together on this planet is just right. A little stronger
5635040	5639680	and we would be a condensed ball, a little weaker and we would be dispersed into the universe.
5639680	5642720	I hate to point out creationists but he's making the same argument you guys do.
5642960	5650400	Our planet and its life forms are the result of many miracles and unique phenomena. The religions
5650400	5655520	rightly say that this is a unique planet and that God has a special design for us. Science
5655520	5660400	is now discovering that too. Mathematicians tell us that the conditions required to give birth to
5660400	5665520	life on any planet in the universe are one of the most staggering astronomical improbability
5665520	5671440	figures they can conceive. New cosmologies are being produced by the dozens but I do not think
5671440	5678000	that anyone is as yet the right one. There are many different views. The physicists, the geneticists,
5678000	5683440	the chemists, the spiritualists each have a view. Which one of those is not like the others?
5684320	5690800	The idiots. I mean spiritualists. That's right. The theosophists. When I put your little dig there
5690800	5694720	a second ago, Christians, this sounds exactly like you guys making your creation arguments.
5694720	5700160	I told you the fundamental spiritual battle is theology versus that's you versus theosophy.
5700160	5704560	That's them and they are stepping into the exact same space at the same time as you guys
5705440	5712400	to try to make these claims and to bring people into their cult rather than keeping them in either
5712400	5719440	reason or faith. He says, but it shows that there is an active search for a new cosmology,
5719440	5724160	for a new understanding of what is happening on this planet where there are many life forms and
5724240	5729840	where one of them namely the human form. Humans, remember we said before protozoan,
5729840	5737680	metazoan, and terazoan? Okay humans are becoming cosmozoas. The main factor of the further evolution
5737680	5743280	transformation and possibly destruction of the planet if we do not understand what is going on
5743280	5751280	and act properly. You're witnessing the birth of a cult religion. This is something he says
5751280	5756480	absolutely extraordinary because it means that each of us is a cosmic unit. Sounds like
5756480	5761600	Deepak Chopra, right? He's one of them. That we have the ingredients of the total cosmos
5761600	5765840	in ourselves. You only know who Deepak Chopra is by the way because they elevated Deepak Chopra
5765840	5769440	because they needed somebody to go talk about this and have debates and become very famous pushing
5769440	5776240	these ideas into the public. How many times was he on Oprah? Oh shit, lots. The cosmos is giving
5776240	5784640	birth to billions of humans as seeds. Uh-oh. The cosmos is giving birth to billions of humans as
5784640	5791120	seeds. Many seeds fall on stone or on infertile ground or do not understand what their duties are,
5791120	5796640	but growing numbers of people understand that they have a cosmic function deep in themselves.
5796640	5799680	See only some people are actually Gnostics and they know that they're going to have to direct
5799680	5805920	the spiritual evolution of the entire human society or the entire human species and the
5805920	5812160	planet itself and cosmic evolution. These people are esoteric theosophists. He says,
5812160	5817040	if you look over history, who are the greatest people? You'll find the Mozart's, the Beethoven's,
5817040	5822880	the philosophers, the sages, the religious leaders. They were all people of cosmic consciousness. Oh,
5822880	5828160	all the geniuses were people like my cult. Of course they try to claim all the people in history
5828160	5835440	like they always do. They were conscious of living in the cosmos in eternity and in the universe at
5835440	5841280	every moment. Really? Mozart was? Like, fucking really? I don't think so. Isn't this like, you
5841280	5846240	say this, the sages and the religious leaders? Isn't this like kind of fucking exactly what Elijah
5846240	5853680	was like? Eh, no. Um, wrong. There's certainly Irenaeus, one of the greats, uh, cast down these
5853680	5859920	heresies in the first century. He says, this is why we listen to them. Well, because they're in the
5859920	5863840	cult. You know, they're all like hundreds of years ago before your stupid cult, but they were in the
5863840	5868000	cult. And this is why we listen to them, because they're part of the cult. They're a vibration,
5868000	5872960	he doesn't say this, I'm saying this, a vibration of the Prisciotheologia, the universal religion.
5873600	5878880	This is why we listen to him. He says, when we read, uh, when we read them, when we see their
5878880	5884160	works, we are deeply moved and elevated. Why? Because they are in tune with the universe and
5884160	5890720	make us feel that way. This is what the religions are trying to sell us. Quote, be in tune with the
5890720	5895840	universe. Be in union with God, with eternity. Remember that your temporary lives have a meaning,
5895840	5901520	a duty to fulfill. End quote. And when we fulfill this duty, the universe recompenses us,
5902080	5908800	recompenses us with a happiness, and possibly even resurrection. It is not impossible that the
5908800	5914800	Hindu philosophy might be right. That only those who had worthwhile lives contributing to the good
5914800	5919600	and the further evolution of this planet will be allowed to live again. And that worthless seeds
5919600	5925840	will be left aside to wither away. The religions can be very helpful in understanding these new
5925840	5934880	cosmologies. Let me just pause for a second. Holy shit. Okay. In other words, he says, humanity,
5934880	5941040	the same way as it has become recently a global family, is also becoming now a cosmic family.
5941600	5948720	This is the United Nations, gentlemen. We will realize that we are a cosmic species,
5948720	5953920	which will find its way on this planet only by following the imminent rules of the cosmos.
5954720	5961040	I'm sure, ladies, that they alone know those rules. And they're going to enforce them through
5961040	5966720	one government, one global government, through the United Nations. Some call it God. Other is a
5966720	5972480	cosmic substratum that is in each of us. It has the manifestation of the living universe divided
5972480	5978320	and distributed over all reality. Well, there's the fundamental hermetic belief. It is possible
5978320	5983840	that stars are just living and dying cells of one body the same way as we are living and dying
5983840	5993120	cells of that same body. Let me pause again. Holy shit. This realization is of incredible
5993120	5999440	momentous importance. It will occupy humanity and give us great hope and challenges. The story
5999440	6004720	was told to us in simple forms by the religions, but now the scientists have come to the same
6004720	6011040	conclusion that the universe is one in its endless manifestations. The recent scientific
6011040	6016800	literature is replete with this finding. So the Gnostics know the secret interpretation of whatever
6016800	6022400	it is he's talking about, and it's whatever they think. My proposal, he says, is therefore that
6022400	6028640	we proceed toward the year 2000. Sorry, I left out the word as. My proposal is therefore that as we
6028640	6033840	proceed toward the year 2000, we should pack this last decade with visions, dreams, ideas,
6033840	6040880	and actions aimed at preparing the next millennium as the cosmic spiritual millennium of this planet
6040880	6046960	in order to properly respond to the expectations of the cosmos or God. In order to do this,
6046960	6052640	I will propose that a number of major conferences or efforts be undertaken which are not yet
6052640	6060400	considered by the United Nations. Peace, disarmament, population, the environment, economic development,
6060480	6065920	et cetera, are all subjects being dealt with in the UN. But here is a list of others
6066560	6071840	which should be taken up in order to prepare adequately the next millennium. So he's about
6071840	6077280	to give a list of suggestions that the United Nations needs to take up that it's not successfully
6077280	6081920	taking up even though overpopulation and the environment are already part of the plan.
6082480	6089040	How many suggestions do you think he makes? How many? It's 17. Of course, it's 17. Of course,
6089360	6096080	it's 17. First, a major conference should be convened on a new cosmology. We just heard what
6096080	6100720	that sounds like. One should listen to the physicists, to the biologists, to the other
6100720	6106640	scientists, and to people who have come up with new cosmologies. That's the weirdo spiritualists,
6106640	6113360	like them. From their views, one would extract a common denominator, a Priscotheologia. They all
6113360	6118000	have very important perceptions, but these perceptions vary with the point of view of their
6118000	6124320	professions, physical, biological, spiritual, social, political, et cetera. At the end of such a
6124320	6129360	conference, we would have a better understanding of what the cosmos is expecting from us in our
6129360	6138320	next phase of evolution. Second, I would recommend a major conference on a new philosophy, a global
6138320	6145280	philosophy. Philosophy is the way of life. What should be the way of life on this planet in global
6145280	6151600	terms in light of our fantastic knowledge? Where are the great sages of our time? Where are the
6151600	6157040	positive philosophies who are giving us an explanation of the meaning of life and hope for the future?
6157040	6160160	I'll tell you where the great sages are. You're censoring them. That's where they are.
6162320	6168560	Third, a new sociology is needed, which will help us understand the meaning and role of all the
6168560	6174400	innumerable groups, entities, professions, and institutions we have on this planet. Most of
6174400	6179520	them have a contribution to make to the progress and success of our evolution. Many of them do not
6179520	6185120	know it and have not even asked the fundamental deeper question of why they exist, why they were
6185120	6191280	created, what their ultimate purpose and contribution should be in the total human fabric. Their limited
6191280	6197280	aims and behaviors must be geared toward the needs of humanity, of the planet, and to the continued
6197360	6203600	success of our cosmic evolution. This is a vast, unexplored, urgent subject.
6205040	6210880	Fourth, we need a new anthropology, as Margaret Mead recommended. Remember, that's the mother of
6210880	6216480	cultural relativism. We need world celebrations as we have them in the family and religions in
6216480	6222240	nations. Humans in the world have to develop common paradigms, common ideals, and benchmarks for
6222240	6228560	the future. The science of the total human race leaves much to be desired. We do more research
6228560	6234880	on tribal systems than on global humanity, its meaning, evolution, and system. So we need a
6234880	6240880	science of humanity, apparently. Fifth, we need an overall human biology. I wonder if it knows
6240880	6246560	what a woman is. A science of human life on this planet, we study more animals and microbes than
6246560	6251440	we study the functioning of the human species. To the biologists, this is political. It should not
6251440	6257360	be so. The biologists should tell us very frankly and honestly how the human species functions,
6257360	6262720	from their point of view as experts in life. If they do it for the fishes and the mammals,
6262720	6267120	they can and should also do it for the human species. Well, they're biologists, so maybe they
6267120	6273760	do know what a woman is, but it doesn't appear to be the case. Sixth, we need a global cosmic
6273760	6279440	spirituality. We have heard religious leaders of various faiths. It was illuminating. I hope that
6279440	6284480	religious leaders will get together and define before the end of this century the cosmic laws
6284480	6290240	which are common to all their faiths. So there's a great ecumenical movement. And imagine if you
6290240	6297440	tied that thing through the church to the businesses and called it the center for inclusive capitalism.
6298960	6303680	They have been cosmic experts and interpreters of the heavens for a long time. They should tell the
6303680	6310160	politicians what the cosmic laws are, what God or the gods or the cosmos are expecting from humans.
6311200	6316560	It's good that we had last year the Oxford Conference of Parliamentarians, scientists,
6316560	6322000	and religious leaders, and that in January 1990 a second conference will be held in Moscow.
6322000	6328480	We must hope also that the Pope will come before the year 2000 to the United Nations, speak for all
6328480	6333920	the religions and spiritualists on the planet, and give the world the religious view of how the
6333920	6338960	third millennium should be a spiritual millennium, a millennium in which we will see the integration
6338960	6345200	and harmony of humanity with creation, with nature, with the planet, with the heavens, and with eternity.
6346240	6352080	Yeah, let the intergalists do it. Their system is an intergalistic system, by the way, just pointing
6352080	6361280	that out. Seventh, we need a new world policy and political system. Uh-oh. This planet is mismanaged
6361280	6366320	to an incredible degree. If the United States were managed like the world is managed, it would be a
6366320	6372560	disaster. Nobody would understand how 50 states in the world has 185, each having a president
6372560	6377920	to flag an army and absolute sovereignty could ever work together. Imagine the United States
6377920	6382960	government in Washington being only a kind of United Nations without any authority, any legislative
6382960	6386800	power, barely any resources. You mean kind of like the founding fathers thought it would be?
6386800	6393120	It would be a disaster. Well, we have this disaster for the world, and it is about time we recognize
6393120	6399760	it. Ken Keyes, I think that's how you say his name. Excellent book Planethood makes this point and
6399760	6405520	offers a way for the political reform of this planet. The birth of the European Union, which was
6405520	6412240	seen by Jean Monnet and Robert Schumann as the first step toward a world union, is the biggest
6412240	6421440	harbinger of hope. How's that going for you now, fuckers? Eighth, we need a proper planetary
6421440	6426560	management. Private firms and the multinationals must face up to the responsibilities for the
6426560	6432960	management of the planet. Oh, ESG. They consider themselves responsible only to profits and
6433040	6437040	stockholders. Well, it's becoming increasingly manifest that this planet was not created for
6437040	6442240	the purpose of making money. We urgently need a science, a strategy, and a methodology for
6442240	6451200	of proper management of planet Earth. There's ESG right there. And there is these big investment
6451200	6457280	firms taking control of all of the private firms and multinationals for the responsibilities for
6457280	6464880	the management of the planet. Environmental social and governance. Ninth, we need a new world,
6464880	6470160	philanthropy. People are giving their wealth and monies to a hospital, to a local university,
6470160	6475920	to a national foundation, or purpose. And the world gets little or nothing. The University for
6475920	6480480	Peace here in the demilitarized Costa Rica is one of the most beautiful and useful projects on the
6480480	6484720	Earth. But where are the philanthropists who are taking an interest in it with the exception of
6484720	6491200	one or two? So he's not getting enough money for his own little stupid project. And yet it is here
6491200	6495920	in this university where a new science of peace must be developed for this planet. Maybe we don't
6495920	6502080	want that shit, dude. And thousands of peacemakers educated for a whole series of professions. Oh,
6502080	6507120	great. More infiltration. The people have to take the financing of the world's care into their own
6507120	6512320	hands. In other words, you taking it literally into your own hands and giving your money where you
6512320	6516720	want is not adequate. So it's going to have to be channeled to what they want. So philanthropy is
6516720	6522640	going to have to be globally coordinated to go to UN designated things. Got you. We do not even have
6522640	6527600	an intergovernmental world budget. Well, if governments do not want to have a world budget,
6527600	6533280	let the philanthropists and the people do it in their own way. A new world democracy will thus
6533280	6543440	be born. 10th, we need a new world education, SDG 4. Global education, namely in the education
6543440	6547760	of children and our global home and into the human family is making good progress.
6548960	6554320	But we have to go beyond. We need the cosmic education foreseen by the religious and by people
6554320	6559520	like Maria Montessori. We need a holistic education teaching the wholism of the universe and the
6559520	6564560	planet. I am glad that one of the first graduates of the Robert Mueller School in Arlington, Texas,
6564560	6570000	which teaches my world core curriculum will take the floor during this conference to announce the
6570000	6576720	creation of a United Nations of Youth. How beautiful. So the guy who created Common Core says we need
6576720	6581600	a new world global education. What's he going to focus on? Well, we now know and I'll do a podcast
6581600	6585920	on this sooner or later, the UN's idea of global citizenship and global citizenship education.
6586000	6594800	11th, we need a new world information. Outer space inspectors would be shocked by the wrong
6594800	6599200	information that is being spread around the world. Uh oh, we've got to manage misinformation and
6599200	6604000	disinformation. We need honest, objective, truthful information to guide our way and
6604000	6608960	behavior and not manipulate information for all kinds of purposes. Iron law of vote projection
6608960	6614960	never misses as we've now learned. Proper world information, communications and media are another
6614960	6621760	subject of paramount importance. The United Nations and its 32 specialized agencies and world
6621760	6628080	programs come closest to that which uh sorry come closest to what such an information system should
6628080	6636640	be. 12th, we need a new world ethics. What is good for the United States, Russia or any other country
6636640	6642320	like having atomic bombs and there are 40,000 in the world can be awfully bad for our planet.
6642320	6647680	I'm sure that God or the cosmos has not created this planet to have all these nuclear detonators
6647680	6655520	and its flesh and its water and its air and in the stars. Okay, I just have to stop there for
6655520	6661920	a second. We haven't put any fucking nuclear weapons in any stars and stars are literally
6661920	6668560	gigantic nuclear explosions of such vast proportions that we can't contemplate them. So
6668560	6674400	if God made the stars, he did want nuclear fucking detonations in the stars. This guy is a
6676160	6682080	sorry lost my temper. I'm sick of these crackpots. I really don't like these people. Anyway,
6682080	6689040	and in the stars and in the stars, what are you adding that for you freaking moron? God.
6690560	6695280	Our political leaders must be given to understand that they do not only have a responsibility
6695280	6700400	toward their people and toward humanity, but toward the success of the extraordinary cosmic
6700400	6705120	process. By the way, dude, the primary energy source of the extraordinary cosmic process is
6705120	6712000	nuclear detonations in the stars. Perhaps unique in the whole universe unfolding on this planet,
6712880	6718080	they might finish it or they might help and foster it. I know we kind of lost the plot on that one.
6718080	6722720	New world ethics. So we've all got to have this new world global ethical system that's
6722720	6727520	facilitated through their occult theosophical religion that's focused on a gyrocracy.
6728160	6733600	Thirteenth, and we remember that 13 is the magical number of power in their numerology.
6734400	6739920	Just like 17 is the magical number of one completed turn of transformation,
6739920	6746160	13 is the power to turn that transformative wheel. So what do they say is 13th? What does he say?
6746160	6751360	Robert Mueller, we need a new world science and technology. The scientists and the technologists
6751440	6756960	must assume a cosmic responsibility. What they are doing might be right or wrong for humanity
6756960	6762720	and for a further evolution. They have to think of the seventh generation and should place Orin
6762720	6767520	Lyon's prayer on their desk. And I do not know what that refers to, but apparently it's written
6767520	6775520	down in idea 899, which is I don't think in this document. Fourteenth, we need a new world economy.
6775600	6782560	Oikos nomos means the management of the home. At long last, we recognize that planet earth
6782560	6789200	is our home. We need a world economy in which all people have decent cosmic lives and perform
6789200	6794000	the functions for which they were born. Sounds exactly like George Soros' idea of an open society
6794000	6800160	or Herbert Marcus' idea of a liberated society or Marx's idea of a completed communism. It goes
6800160	6805440	far beyond the new international economic order. It is a restructuring of the economy based on
6805440	6814720	the ecology, Oikos logos, and the knowledge of our planet. We have to put our house, which is on the
6814720	6820720	planet, in good evolutionary order to become a planet of extraordinary beauty, conservation,
6820720	6826560	renewal, happiness, and justice for all. So we need an entire new world economy. I bet you it's
6826560	6834240	going to work like agenda 30 by 30, where by the year 2030, that's the by 30 part, 30% of the world
6834240	6840240	will be uninhabited and back to the wild and not used for any commercial or productive purpose.
6842480	6848800	Fifteenth, we need a new world art. See the table framework for the planetary cosmic role of art
6848800	6853600	and culture. I love the way they talk. The planetary cosmic role of art.
6856160	6860560	We need a renaissance of art similar to the Italian Renaissance, which put things into harmony
6860560	6866480	again. Modern art was the expression of our analytical period. We dissected everything.
6866480	6870880	We now know it was probably propped up by crackpots who wanted to put ugly crap in front of us to
6870880	6877840	demoralize us, frankly. Art has to be paid for. We now have to put everything into harmony again.
6877840	6883840	We need a holistic universal art expressing our faith, sense of beauty, happiness, and planetary,
6883840	6889520	humanistic cosmic consciousness. As all great poets, writers, painters, musicians, and sculptors
6889520	6895520	have done in the past. The classic book by Richard Burke on cosmic consciousness gives us a whole
6895520	6901680	list of such people. We also need world anthems like the one we heard this morning. Some of the
6901680	6907440	sanguinary violent national anthems need to be rewritten. I think that that one might include
6907440	6912560	the national anthem of the United States, the Star Spangled Banner, which is a very interesting
6912560	6916560	national anthem because it's actually not about a war. A lot of people think it's about
6916560	6923360	happening within a war. The first stanza of the Star Spangled Banner is a question.
6924880	6932480	Is our flag still there? Are we still going to make it? We have a long, dangerous, perilous night
6932480	6939200	in this war for our independence attacking us to establish this new nation of ideals and human
6939200	6945440	liberty, and is it still there? That's the whole point, but I bet you, I bet you that's part of it.
6945920	6951200	He says, I have a new text of the Marseilles written by young people, which starts with the words
6952080	6958480	Aliens en font de la planète, come children of the planet. Why not? It is beautiful. I hope that
6958480	6963040	the young people in Strasbourg will sing it on the occasion of the 200th anniversary of the French
6963040	6969040	Revolution. Several national anthems have similarly been rewritten by young people. I have a whole
6969040	6978480	file of them. That's great. No. 16th, we need a new world psychology. Does it know what a woman is?
6979120	6984320	We must learn how to love our wonderful earth and miraculous humanity above anything else.
6984320	6989600	Now we're being taught to love a nation or a group or a religion and to kill other human beings,
6989600	6998160	other divine beings for them. Well, not really. I mean, some do that, but there is this whole
6998160	7003040	just war concept where you get to defend yourself if people attack you or try to steal your stuff.
7003040	7009760	I mean, there's a thing. This is contrary to nature and to cosmic divine laws. We have to love
7009760	7014640	humanity. We have to love the planet. We have to love the universe and have to be their instruments
7014640	7019120	during our short years on this earth. If we do not, life on this planet will come to an end.
7019680	7024960	A completely new world psychology must lay down our right sentimental priorities. This is what
7024960	7034080	Freud told Einstein, the idea 1020, in their famous exchange of views. 17th. And he starts this way,
7034080	7039920	and this is very significant. 17th but not last. Let me tell you real quick. There's no 18. So it
7039920	7047600	is 17th but last, but he inserts or insists 17th but not last. Why? Because it's a cycle of evolution.
7047600	7053760	17 steps to turn history once. And then there will be 17 more steps to turn history again,
7053760	7059440	another revolution. Revolutions in 17 steps. Marx identified 17 contradictions in capitalism.
7060000	7066080	Paulo Freire said it takes 17 generative themes to radicalize or conscientize a learner.
7067040	7072800	The Corpus Hermeticum has 17 books. I'm not going to get into the spiral of Theodorus and
7072800	7078560	where this comes from from the Pythagorean mathematical numbers cult, but that's ultimately
7078560	7085200	what it is. 17th but not last. We must teach the children of this planet a new art of living.
7085760	7091280	Show them how great life is. How's that going for you guys? How's your comprehensive sexuality
7091280	7097040	education working out for their precious little minds? It's killing them. We should teach them
7097040	7102480	how thankful they should be to live today at this time of magnificent consciousness and the
7102480	7107760	incredible knowledge of the universe, that it will be their role to be the right managers of the
7107760	7113440	planet, that each of them is a cosmic unit or as Pablo Casals said, quote, a true miracle,
7113440	7118720	a potential Leonardo or Beethoven. Therefore, you cannot hurt, you cannot kill another miracle,
7118720	7124800	end quote. How's that working out guys? How's your, how are your things working out for that?
7124800	7133360	Seems like you're lying. Yes, we are miracles, microcosms, cosmozoas of the universe. This must
7133360	7137360	be taught to children so that they can flower to the responsibility for which they're born. In
7137360	7141840	other words, global citizenship education, which is defined literally in terms of teaching them to
7141840	7148320	meet the 17 Sustainable Development Goals of the United Nations Agenda 2030. We also have to teach
7148320	7153840	frugality, the deep growth, and simple living in order not to destroy or tax unduly the beautiful
7153840	7160720	creation of God. We should follow in the footsteps of St. Francis, who preached this 800 years ago.
7160720	7167840	We should read Voluntary Simplicity by Dwayne Elgin. Simple frugal lives of five billion people
7167840	7173520	are the most monumental contribution to the environment of this planet. Every human being
7173520	7179360	should know that he or she is an instrument of God or the universe, be it as a mother who gives
7179360	7184880	life to a child, as a new divine being, or as a father who in the family is raising a new cosmic
7184880	7194240	unit, or an educator who is educating new cosmogens, or a doctor who will heal cosmic
7194240	7201920	patients or public servants or artists, etc. There's 17. Then we will fully validate life and
7201920	7207680	make children and people proud to be alive. How's that going for you guys? We gave you guys a 20
7207680	7213920	year run on that. How's it going? Is that working? Is that what's happening? Then humans will respect
7213920	7219840	their own miraculous divine cosmicity, as Buckminster Fuller said when he was offered cigarettes,
7219840	7224160	quote, I will never do anything that might impair the functioning of the perfect cosmic
7224160	7230720	unit I have been given by the universe, end quote. This is a language which we should hold to
7230720	7237840	children. This would be the real fight against drugs, alcohol, and violent television and literature.
7237840	7244640	How's that working out? You do not damage your incredible cosmic entity by introducing
7244640	7249600	poisonous materials and images into its functioning. Can we talk about books like Gender Queer?
7250880	7254640	Which is part of your comprehensive sexuality education stuff. Can we talk about what you're
7254640	7260160	actually doing? We can validate life to an unprecedented degree and extend it to the
7260160	7265280	largest and smallest manifestations of the universe. This should be the philosophy of the
7265280	7270960	next century. I would like to conclude by saying that perhaps we should replace the popular recent
7270960	7278560	saying, quote, think globally act locally by think cosmically act locally wherever you live
7278560	7285040	on this miraculous planet. Thank you very much for giving me some of your precious cosmic time.
7285040	7292080	Doesn't just make you want to punch this guy in the head. Idea 1633. So now we elaborate on this.
7292960	7300320	29 December 1998. The word politics should be abolished and replaced by something much deeper.
7300320	7305920	I like planetics, the management of our planet. But it's even deeper than that. What is happening
7305920	7311360	on our earth is a whole series of fundamental biological evolutionary changes. We need to
7311360	7316720	consider the biology and evolution of the earth in its entirety. This should be the only concern
7316720	7323200	of government to manage the entire earth. The collective preoccupations of humanity should
7323200	7329280	be for the state of the planet and the conditions and future of all life on it. The word politics
7329280	7334960	must be abandoned. Politicians should become earth biologists and all faculties of political
7334960	7342400	science faculties of earth biology and evolution. You get the idea that the United Nations sucks
7342400	7351440	in a big way. Idea 1634. 30 December 1998. Human history proves that there are always
7351440	7357520	very great barriers, obstacles to a peaceful just and harmonious world. In the past it was futility.
7358240	7363840	Then the kingdoms and the empires. Today it is nationalism and tomorrow it will be the big
7363840	7369360	multinational companies. It is a mistake to hope that these barriers will disappear by themselves.
7370000	7374480	All human history proves that they have to be dismantled in order to be replaced by something
7374480	7380640	else. We have reached that point of modern history where both nationalisms and big multinational
7380640	7388720	corporations must be dismantled and replaced by something else. It has to come from an outside
7388720	7395040	force, a people's revolution or revolution of the scientists, thinkers, visionaries,
7395040	7401920	prophets, globalists, futurologists and synthesizers of this planet. So there you have the global
7401920	7406240	agenda. We have to get rid of nationalisms and start thinking in terms of global citizenship.
7406240	7411280	And there you have ESG. Big multinational corporations are dismantled. None of them
7411280	7417520	can do what they want on their own. They are all owned by one another and act in monopoly trust.
7417520	7422320	They are not what they were before. They are dismantled and replaced by something else that
7422320	7429440	works in line with ESG and United Nations agendas. Why are so many companies so hell bent to achieve
7429440	7437040	their agenda 2030 net zero targets? Because they've been dismantled and replaced by something else.
7437040	7442640	It's not multinational corporations even, which are their own set of problems. They are monopoly
7442640	7451360	trusts that act in the interest of the United Nations agenda. Idea 1708. Regarding globalization,
7451360	7457120	one could take my world core curriculum, C volume one, and envisions the globalization and
7457120	7463200	futurization of every segment of it. An individual can globalize himself. Families can globalize
7463200	7468880	themselves. States, province, departments, that is, local levels of government could globalize
7468880	7474320	themselves by creating world associations for local communities, states, provinces, etc.
7474880	7479520	It would be a benefit to them to learn how other subdivisions like theirs are governed,
7479520	7485440	legislated, and administered elsewhere in the world. It would be an incredibly rich reciprocal
7485440	7490480	experience. So that's the idea of global citizenship, which is to be implemented on every
7490480	7495680	single level. It kind of takes the idea of subsidiarity and turns it inside out and on its head.
7497680	7501920	Yeah, the local stuff is all going to work, you know, as much authority as possible is going to
7501920	7506000	be put into local hands, but they are all going to have to be transformed to only do the big global
7506000	7512480	or I guess cosmic agenda that's coordinated through the central coordinating and cooperation
7512480	7517520	facilities of the United Nations and its new world religion. So if you get everybody in the
7517520	7522080	new world religion, you can tell them that they manage their own affairs as maximally as possible,
7522080	7526480	but it's because they all follow the same religion. So that's why it's so important for them to take
7526480	7534080	over and transform all the faiths into one corrupt global faith. And that's why this isn't,
7534080	7539680	like if you don't understand that this cult theosophy is in fact a cult religion,
7539680	7544000	a global cult religion startup, then you're missing the entire point.
7545040	7551920	Idea 1745. On the occasion of the year 2000, governments and the diplomatic community should
7551920	7556960	pay attention to the proposals for a better United Nations offered by Harold Stassen,
7556960	7562560	one of the world's last living members who signed the charter. He sees the United Nations change
7562560	7566240	from a place where meetings on political, economic and social issues are held
7566240	7571680	into a creative center where ideas on religion and philosophy are exchanged for a better future.
7571680	7576880	Among his proposals are a central cabinet of administrators, a universal environmental
7576880	7585520	institute, a United Nations legion, an inspection corp, a world panel of mediators, a world
7585520	7592960	board of arbitration, a world court of equity, a worldwide conference on religions, and a research
7592960	7598320	institute of people and government. His book should be read by every delegate to the United
7598320	7605040	Nations, by every head of state before coming to the year 2000 General Assembly, and in all
7605040	7610080	political science faculties of universities throughout the world. So yeah, they're kind of
7610080	7617040	after like everything. So that's, you've now got a taste of how crazy it is. And those 17 points
7617040	7623760	and the whole new genesis were the real big points. This is your United Nations. So I'm going to close
7623760	7628960	by reading three more of these ideas, and that's it. But I wanted you to have a sense that the
7628960	7632720	United Nations is not what you think it is. The United Nations, what you might think is if you're
7632720	7636400	one of my followers, but generally speaking, people don't realize what the United Nations is.
7636400	7642080	The United Nations is an organization that is wholly dedicated to global governance under an
7642080	7648480	occult, theosophical religion. And if we don't understand what we're dealing with, we're going
7648480	7654400	to completely misunderstand what we need to be doing. The United States, it said, needs to decline.
7654400	7660800	Why? Because we're not in alignment, or we can be not in alignment with their program. This is why
7660800	7665360	they freaked out when Trump took office. Trump actually pulled us back from all of this. He
7665360	7670480	removed us from UNESCO. They know that he was going to put America's interests ahead of their
7670480	7675760	theosophy, and that was why they have to attack the United States so vigorously. And that's why
7675760	7681200	they do attack the United States so vigorously, because the United States, in its fully constituted
7681200	7686560	form, and its constitution at its heart, is the biggest threat to this cult religion trying to
7686560	7691360	take over the world that there is. But I'll close with, like I said, three more of these ideas,
7692160	7699280	so we don't drag this out. Idea number 562, 25 January 1996. Last but not least,
7699840	7705040	humanity has reached a point when we must consider our human presence, past, present,
7705040	7710240	and future on this particular planet in the universe. We now have a tremendous information,
7710240	7714160	sorry, no, that's what it says. Sorry, I didn't read it right. We now have a tremendous information
7714160	7719840	on the universe in which we live. In addition to our total consciousness of our earth and its global
7719840	7726400	evolution, we are now also acquiring and developing a cosmic consciousness of the universe. This is
7726400	7733680	the greatest of all our advances in human history, so their cult is. But the mysteries of infinity
7733680	7739200	and eternity still escape us and will remain outside of human and scientific grasp. This has
7739200	7745280	the result of bringing together the spirituality or basic faiths of all religions and science.
7745840	7752160	Faiths, by the way, is in scare quotes. This has the result of bringing together the spirituality
7752160	7760320	or basic, quote, faiths of all religion and science. God, the gods, or the great spirit,
7760320	7766880	or spirits, or their emissaries, prophets, and human incarnations like Jesus, gave humanity its
7766880	7774480	early stages of a cosmic universal, all-encompassing faith or feeling for the mysteries of the cosmos,
7774480	7780560	for the norms of love and for the miracle of life and norms of behavior between all humans
7780560	7788000	and with all other species and nature. That's claiming an awful lot. These messages, or quote,
7788000	7793040	revelations, should not be neglected. Uh-oh, they probably something should happen to them like
7793040	7798800	them being transcended. They contain some of the most, some of the profoundest answers to human
7798800	7803680	behavior, fulfillment, and survival. Great was our astonishment in the environmental crisis
7804320	7809600	to discover the wisdom and rules of behavior toward nature dictated by the great spirit to
7809600	7815840	the indigenous people of this planet. The world's 5,000 religions are filled with incredible wisdom
7815840	7822160	regarding human morality, belief in life, environmental adaptation, survival, and future
7822160	7829280	evolution. This is strongly coming to the fore at this time as manifested in the following.
7830400	7833920	But let me pause before we talk about the following because I want to go back to the
7833920	7840880	Jesus part here. Uh, so God, the gods, or the great spirit, or spirits, and their emissaries,
7840880	7846800	prophets, and human incarnations like Jesus. So all of these characters, Jesus is just one of many.
7846800	7853840	Jesus is just another Buddha who gave humanity at its early stages a cosmic consciousness. So this
7853840	7859040	is the rise, you've heard this phrase recently probably if you're too tapped in on social media,
7859040	7864320	this is the rise, and this is part of the new thought movement that this is all, all into.
7864320	7868960	This is the rise of the idea of the Christ consciousness. And of course the Christ consciousness
7868960	7873440	is the awakened cosmic consciousness this guy's talking about. And this Christ consciousness
7873440	7878320	was supposed to be embodied by Jesus and many of the other great sages and buddhas of history,
7878320	7884720	and also the gurus, or the shamans, or whatever else. But Christ consciousness is a counterfeit.
7884720	7892720	It is not at all biblical. It is a heretical, theosophical idea. And it is actually on the
7892720	7900080	rise again. And you need to be sensitive to seeing that because the battle at a spiritual level,
7900160	7907120	spiritual battle we're engaged in is theology versus theosophy. Jesus didn't stutter. He didn't
7907120	7913600	say there's a bunch of us that are like me. He didn't say that. He said he is the way of the
7913600	7920960	truth in the life. He said the way is straight and narrow. Many, you know, the path of many is
7920960	7926880	the path of destruction. He's very clear about what's going on. He said to, he said to follow
7926960	7930560	the law. Which law was he talking about? The law of the universe? No.
7931840	7937360	He claims, or the Gospel of John claims that he is the logos itself made flesh. So he is,
7938080	7942800	in addition to whatever else on a more profound spiritual level, he is literally the embodiment
7942800	7951840	of truth. This is not what's being presented. This is a Gnostic counterfeit of that. So the Gnostic
7951840	7956080	New Thought Movement is embodied. If you go listen to, you can listen to people like Deepak Chopra
7956080	7960880	and all these guys that are their mouthpieces. Look up the phrase Christ consciousness and see
7960880	7965360	what comes up. I haven't done it, but I'm so confident that what you're going to find is crazy
7965360	7971200	theosophical stuff that I'm not worried telling you to do it. Okay, so all of this is in our next
7971200	7975440	stages of evolution is strongly coming to the fore at this time. He said, has manifested in the
7975440	7981760	following. One, the dream and plan of my compatriot Robert Schumann from Alsace-Lorraine
7982720	7986880	to see the European Union, which started with a coal and steel community, followed by an
7986880	7994560	economic community, followed by a political union, culminate in an all spiritual European Union,
7994560	7999840	including the Eastern European countries, especially Holy Mother Russia.
8001600	8007680	Let that one sink in. Two, the creation in 85 countries, including as a third party in the
8007680	8013360	United States of the Natural Law Party. Based on the premise that the laws of nature should guide
8013360	8019600	humans and their political behavior and organization, there is only one step to recognize that natural
8019600	8024800	laws are in reality cosmic laws. So they're going to take the concept of natural law, pervert it,
8024800	8028880	if they were to get their way with this, and then say that that's a step in their cosmic
8028880	8032320	evolution. It's the same Gnostic thing I talked about in the past where they say, yeah, yeah,
8032320	8037200	yeah, the thing you've got, that's really wise. And that's also stepped like four out of 10. Come
8037200	8043280	with us, I've got the other six. And cosmic, astral, blah, blah, blah, is coming down the
8043280	8048400	pike and only they secretly understand it. Three, the San Francisco, and this is the one I really
8048400	8054000	wanted to hit, the San Francisco Initiative to Create a United Religions Organization similar
8054000	8060000	to the United Nations, also born in that city, where all religions of the world could cooperate,
8060000	8065520	define what they have in common, provide their wisdom on human behavior and morality,
8065520	8071600	and write relations with nature and the creation of God, which I don't know if that's a pun,
8071600	8078560	I assume that it's relations with the creation of God, but maybe they mean the act of creating God.
8079440	8084320	In the process, they will hopefully reduce and progressively give up their fundamentalism,
8084960	8089120	and in other words, actually believing their real faiths in favor of some theosophy,
8089840	8094160	they will hopefully reduce and progressively give up their fundamentalism in favor of a global
8094160	8100000	spirituality, the same way as nations in the United Nations have reduced the national fundamentalism
8100000	8107840	called sovereignty, and given away their sovereignty to the United Nations to govern their affairs from
8107840	8115120	a remote, unaccountable, theosophical cult that we should be getting as far away from
8115120	8122480	as humanly possible. He goes on to say, may God help us that a world conference be convened
8122480	8129280	on proper earth government through what the world's religions have in common in terms of
8129280	8134720	universal global spirituality and worldwide human experience, in other words, a Prisket theologia.
8136240	8139360	So that was one idea, 1998.
8141760	8148080	20 years ago, I wrote an essay on the need for global education. Today, I would write an essay on
8148080	8153600	the need for evolutionary education. Tomorrow, I would write an essay on the need for cosmic
8153600	8158400	education. So I want to phrase those things in different words. I'm just going to say the same
8158400	8166320	thing. 20 years ago, I wrote an essay on the need to develop common core. Today, I would write an
8166320	8171760	essay on the need for a social and emotional learning. And tomorrow, I would write an essay
8171760	8178640	on the need for global citizenship education. That's what it's going on. That's who this guy is.
8179200	8183920	And we did the first two of those, and we're working on the third. And the United Nations is
8183920	8189440	actually behind all three of them. And it's all based in a cult theosophical religion that they're
8189440	8194880	using education to bring your children into, even though it's damaging to them, even though they know
8194880	8200240	that it causes severe anxiety, depression, and cognitive dissonance, that they can then use
8200240	8205520	the social emotional learning techniques, which are effectively brainwashing techniques, to override
8205520	8212080	in the kids. I did that whole podcast on that document called SEL for SDGs, social emotional
8212080	8216480	learning for the Sustainable Development Goals. So there you go. You can read the Sustainable
8216480	8220880	Development Goals as evolutionary education and global citizenship as the next step after we
8220880	8229280	achieve that spiritual, which is the common core, and then material, and that sustainability, and
8229280	8239200	then, sorry, I did it wrong. Ideal, that's the common core. And then material, that's the sustainable
8239200	8246160	development education. And then spiritual would be global consciousness or cosmic consciousness,
8246160	8251200	I guess, which is global citizenship education. He goes on to say, after World War II, humanity
8251200	8256240	acquired beyond national consciousness, a global consciousness. See, it's about global citizenship
8256320	8260640	education. Today, humanity is acquiring an evolutionary consciousness. A consciousness
8260640	8266560	is a future. Tomorrow, humanity will acquire a cosmic consciousness. After World War II,
8266560	8272960	the United Nations was born as the planet's first global organization. Today, the United Nations is
8272960	8277760	becoming the planet's evolutionary organization. So it's not meant to be a facilitator of global
8277760	8284320	cooperation. It's meant to direct the evolution of mankind. Tomorrow, he says the United Nations
8284320	8292080	will become the planet's first cosmic organization. This is a cult theosophical organization.
8293040	8298720	With humanity's transcendence into cosmic consciousness and space and in time,
8298720	8305680	the sciences and religions will converge into an all-encompassing, holistic, spiritual age
8305680	8311200	dreamt of by our ancestors, prophets, visionary saints, and earthly incarnations of the divine
8311840	8319040	cosmic forces over eons of time. In other words, Prescott theologia. Our future, he says, is
8319040	8325280	incredibly bright and hopeful if we hasten these processes and think in time of ways to face
8325280	8332960	very likely emergencies. Isn't that telling? So the goal is to create a one-world theosophical
8332960	8336960	religion that blends all of the faiths, all the sciences, all the philosophies, all of the
8336960	8344960	activities into one thing, one all-encompassing, holistic, spiritual age dreamt of by all of the
8344960	8351760	cosmic forces over eons of time. Wow. And we will have a bright future if we hasten toward that
8351760	8355840	and prepare ourselves to face very likely emergencies, which seems to be what the World
8355840	8361840	Economic Forum decided it was going to do. And what the UN subsidiary, the World Health Organization,
8361840	8370000	decided to switch its mission from coordinating various things about diseases and medicines
8370000	8376320	and things like that to whatever the hell it's doing now trying to claim sovereignty over the
8376320	8381360	world, which we just heard that sovereignty was the problem that has to be overcome. National
8381360	8387200	sovereignty has to be destroyed. And in similar, he said literally in similar ways to the way that
8387200	8391680	we're overcoming national sovereignty to a globalist consciousness, we need to overcome individual
8391760	8398800	faiths and fundamentalism to a global theosophical occult religion. And I think last but not least
8398800	8406160	idea number 1982. He says in idea 502 in volume two, I listed the three main periods through
8406160	8413360	which the United Nations and humanity have gone since 1945. One, humanism, two, the environment,
8413360	8420880	and three, the earth as number one. In these last 500 ideas, I mentioned a fourth period,
8420880	8425120	our future evolution. That's the really crazy pants part of the document, by the way, that I was
8425120	8430560	reading through was a reflection on those. Of course, these are ideas 500-ish and those were
8430560	8435920	ideas 1600-ish, so it's not identical. I'm not saying that, but that's what he actually reflects
8435920	8441680	there is these three phases. And then the fourth one is our future evolution. So anyway, as he
8441680	8446960	continues, it suddenly occurs to me that the United Nations is still structured according to the
8446960	8452880	needs and philosophy of the first period, namely humanism, with the objectives of peace, well-being,
8452880	8459120	health, labor, food, education, culture, human rights, etc. The structure of the United Nations
8459120	8465680	system does not reflect adequately the other three recent and equally fundamental preoccupations
8465680	8472800	except the environment. A basic restructuring of the United Nations and its specialized agencies
8472800	8478720	must therefore be considered to make it the principal central organization of the earth
8478720	8484400	and future evolution. We should create a world air and atmosphere agency, a world water agency,
8484400	8490720	a world climate agency, a world ocean agency, a world outer space agency, etc. Within these
8490720	8496720	fundamental aspects of the earth, we should consider the place, action, and fulfillment of
8496720	8502400	the human species. This reform should become a priority on the agenda of world affairs
8503600	8509360	at this beginning of a new century and millennium. And I think that's exactly what they did.
8509360	8514480	That's exactly what happened. The United Nations, however bad or whatever it was in its inception
8514480	8521600	at the beginning, in the 21st century, in the third millennium, became a monster. And that monster is
8521600	8527120	completely imbued with a cult theosophical view of the world and of humanity and of its mission in
8527120	8532720	the world. I don't think that disagrees with its founding from the Huxleys, but just to point out
8532720	8537600	it was being said at the time that the United Nations was not making this change satisfactorily
8537600	8543120	by high level people in the United Nations. But that's what it turned to become. That's what it
8543120	8549280	has become. And that's what we're dealing with when we look at the United Nations. It is the
8549280	8557760	headquarters of a world theosophical cult. It is not what it appears to be. We should have
8558480	8563600	nothing to do with it. So I hope that we can start thinking about this more. I'm going to,
8563600	8569840	in the notes for this episode, put a link to all four volumes, not just this particular document,
8569840	8575280	but all four volumes of Robert Mueller's ramblings and Robert Mueller's website,
8575280	8581280	so that you can go look through the other God knows how many ideas, almost 2,000 ideas yourself.
8581280	8589280	I didn't even read a hundred of them. So that you have a real sense of how insanely dangerous
8589280	8592800	the United Nations really is. And I just want you to remember who this guy is. He was a very
8592800	8597360	high level player in the United Nations. He is the creator of something we're going to be talking
8597360	8601760	more about. And I encourage you to listen to Lisa Logan about this, this group called the
8601760	8606160	Evolutionary Leaders. These are very important people that you think you don't know about,
8606160	8610400	that it's going to sound totally insane when you find out about them. So we'll probably hear
8610400	8616240	more about that as we go. But he was also the creator of the Common Core curriculum, in line
8616240	8623840	with trying to get exactly these corrupt values pushed into these religious values, pushed into
8623840	8629440	education. I don't think Common Core succeeded. I think the primary effect Common Core had in
8629440	8634320	practice was to separate the ability for parents to help their children do homework,
8634320	8638960	and thus disconnect them so that the children became more reliant on the teachers. And as we've
8638960	8643120	moved into social and emotional learning and global citizenship education and education for
8643120	8649360	sustainable development, they've been able to take advantage of that broken chain from parent to child
8649360	8656000	and take the children in this other direction. In other words, indoctrinating them into this
8656000	8663920	theosophical cult of what they consider to be Earth worship for the direction of mankind and
8663920	8671600	Earth's future evolution on every possible level. Again, the conclusion is simple. We had it right
8671600	8676720	when we made them mad. We should pull away from the United Nations as quickly and thoroughly as
8676720	8681360	possible. We should discredit the United Nations. We should reject everything the United Nations
8681360	8684640	tries to impose on us at whether it's the local level, the state level,
8684640	8690000	ideally eventually at the United States federal level, and we should defund it completely. It is
8690000	8695840	time for us to recognize the United Nations as an evil cult, and it is time for us to abolish the
8695840	8697280	United Nations.
