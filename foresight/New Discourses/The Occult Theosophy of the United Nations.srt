00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:24,400
Hey everybody, it's James Lindsay. You're listening to the New Discourses podcast, and in particular

2
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:29,040
you're listening to another long weird episode of the New Discourses podcast because we're going

3
00:00:29,040 --> 00:00:36,160
to talk about something weird yet again in rather tremendous depth. We're going to talk about the

4
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:41,440
United Nations. And a matter of fact, what we're going to talk about is there was a United Nations

5
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:48,000
character, I'll kind of spell this out in a minute named Robert Mueller, and in the 2000 days leading

6
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:57,600
up to the year 2000. So the 2000 days leading up to January 1st, 2000, Robert Mueller, who was by

7
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:07,120
no means a small player in the United Nations pantheon, laid out what he called 2000 ideas and

8
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:13,680
dreams for a better world, or sometimes he referred to it as 2000 ideas, or 2000 ideas for the year

9
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:21,440
2000. And in essence, he was laying out ideas and dreams like kind of his just thoughts, 2000 of

10
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:25,440
them as a matter of fact, for the direction that the United Nations should take and the role it

11
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:31,040
should play in the world in the 21st century. And the point of this podcast is to tell you some

12
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:35,360
of what he said, and so that we can realize that the direction of the United Nations, whatever

13
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:40,880
the United Nations was intended to be from its origins, and since it originated with the Huxleys,

14
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:46,880
I don't think it was necessarily ever meant to be a good organization. I think it's always had

15
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:54,240
theosophical roots, but it is unambiguous in these documents that Robert Mueller, and I'll tell you

16
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:58,960
who he is in a second, you know who he is, you just don't realize you know who he is. He's not the

17
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:04,000
guy that prosecuted Trump. That's a different Robert Mueller, or I should say, investigated

18
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,560
Trump. It's spelled differently. They're not the same guy. But you've heard of him before.

19
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:15,520
It's unambiguous in these documents that Robert Mueller wanted the United Nations to reconstitute

20
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:21,520
itself for the 21st century, that he wasn't satisfied with how theosophical the United Nations

21
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:25,600
was in the 20th century, and he wanted it to reconstitute itself as an explicitly

22
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:31,040
very theosophical organization going into the 21st century. So he delivers this in the late

23
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:40,400
1999, I should specify, to the UN Secretary General at the time and urges him to read these,

24
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:48,080
and he actually, the document I'm pulling from is a small document that he sent specifically to

25
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:52,640
the Secretary General to pay attention to, which is a condensation. So the way Robert Mueller

26
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:58,240
published 2000 ideas and dreams for a better world, or 2000 ideas for the year 2000,

27
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:05,520
was in four volumes. I'll make all four volumes are on his website, Robert Mueller.org. I'll make

28
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:12,240
those available in links to this so you can go see all 2000 ideas if you want. He said he was

29
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:17,440
going to write 3000 ideas because the plans were meant to extend to the year 3000 for the United

30
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:24,560
Nations, but I don't know if the other 1000 ever got written. I haven't looked that deeply into it

31
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:30,720
yet, but he wrote this condensed version where he wrote 59 pages of the ones that he thought was

32
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:36,320
more most important in the realm of spiritual direction that the UN should take in world

33
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:40,960
leadership, including of course, a one world government headquartered through the United

34
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:45,600
Nations or coordinated through the United Nations. And it's kind of creepy how much of it seems to

35
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:51,360
fit with what we're dealing with, because this is straight occult theosophy guiding the ship of

36
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:56,400
the United Nations, which means the United Nations, whatever it started as, and like I said, I don't

37
00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:02,160
think it started good. I think it's always been an occult theosophical organization, and I think

38
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:06,640
there are reasons to believe that that's true, some of which I've discussed before, like in the

39
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:16,560
WTF is SEL podcast. Certainly for the last two decades, since I will say specifically 2003,

40
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:23,120
it has been oriented toward a transformational project, and that transformational project is

41
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:27,520
rooted in occult theosophy. So it's not a good organization. It's not a neutral organization.

42
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:33,600
It's not even really a governing organization. It is an occult organization. It is a best you

43
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:40,320
could say is really weird organization. Worst you could say is that it's genuinely an evil

44
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:45,680
organization. And I think that we, this is all very positive the way that Robert Mueller wrote

45
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:49,600
this, but I think that we're going to come away understanding that. And because this is going

46
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:55,360
to be really long, I've set aside almost 10,000 words of his writing to explore. I want to just

47
00:04:55,360 --> 00:05:01,920
kind of dive in and not preamble too much, but we got to start with who is Robert Mueller.

48
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:07,040
So Robert Mueller worked at the United Nations. It's M-U-L-L-E-R. It's not, again, the same guy

49
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:11,680
who investigated Trump. That's a different Robert Mueller, spelled differently. He worked at the

50
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:16,640
United Nations for over 40 years. He was at one time the assistant secretary general, so he was

51
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:22,240
very high up. He was very well respected. He was very well networked throughout the United Nations

52
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:27,520
through much of that long career. But more importantly, and this is where you've heard

53
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:33,360
of him before, is he's the guy who developed the World Core Curriculum, which was meant to be

54
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:42,560
a new education method for the entire planet, according to a set of core curriculum points

55
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:47,520
that were going to be core to the entire world's education program. In the United States, that

56
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:55,120
became Common Core. So Common Core was created slightly indirectly, but basically by Robert

57
00:05:55,120 --> 00:06:02,320
Mueller at the United Nations. Now, I introduced that concept to you previously. In the very long

58
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:08,720
WTF is SEL. What the F is, Social Emotional Learning Podcasts that I did some time ago,

59
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:14,000
where I pointed out that Robert Mueller's ideas were, in fact, strongly influenced by

60
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:20,320
the occult theosophist who created the Lucifer publishing company named Alice Bailey. His ideas

61
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:25,840
about education were inspired by an an occult theosophist named Alice Bailey. Now, the point of

62
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:30,880
that podcast wasn't to talk about Common Core and its origins or Robert Mueller, it was just kind of a

63
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:35,680
sidebar. The point was to talk about Social Emotional Learning and its development at the

64
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:40,400
Fedser Institute. Now, I want to remind you, by the way, so far as these two programs go,

65
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:44,640
Social Emotional Learning and Common Core, both of which, both of these were very heavily funded

66
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:48,880
by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation gave hundreds of

67
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:54,480
millions of dollars to pushing the Common Core or the World Core curriculum into the United States,

68
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:59,680
but that wasn't enough. And when Common Core kind of started to falter and it got replaced with

69
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:06,640
Social Emotional Learning starting in 2015 and 16, Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation has dumped

70
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:12,560
possibly up to two billion dollars into pushing that. But the point is that they're both based in

71
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:20,480
the same occult theosophy, deriving from the rantings of Alice Bailey and others. But Robert

72
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:25,440
Mueller was no small player. Like I said, he was Assistant Secretary General of the United Nations

73
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:30,080
for a while. He was named the Chancellor of the United Nations University for Peace, which is

74
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:36,800
headquartered in Costa Rica. He talks about this. He also organized a group you haven't heard about

75
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:41,600
yet, but you're going to need to hear about, which is called the Evolutionary Leaders. Who are the

76
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:46,640
Evolutionary Leaders? Well, they're a bunch of theosophical occult weirdos who believe in something

77
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:52,000
that is called the New Thought Movement or New Thought Religion. I would say it's the Gnostic

78
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:58,800
New Thought Movement, because it is a Gnostic and Hermetic kind of spin-off cult. It has roots tied

79
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:03,280
back to, I know I've talked about this briefly in the past with some of the Gnosticism and Hermeticism

80
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:09,120
podcasts, has roots tied back into the Kabalian, which is probably written by this guy Atchkinson.

81
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:14,400
I always say his name a little bit messed up. I got to work on that. And so this is like legit,

82
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:21,040
legit, theosophical, I would say New Age, but the name of it's actually New Thought. And then

83
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:26,000
it's a Gnostic approach. It's a Gnostic religion. And their goal is to make a Gnostic One World

84
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:33,440
Religion that's the one religion in the world that's coordinated and interwoven with the governments,

85
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:40,080
a world government through the United Nations. And you would be very familiar if you are a daytime

86
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:46,880
TV aficionado from the 90s and early 2000s, with lots of the evolutionary leaders, even though you

87
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:51,440
didn't know you're familiar with them, because Oprah Winfrey has platformed every single one of them.

88
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:58,640
The so-called New Age stuff, which is all occult theosophy, that Oprah Winfrey and her

89
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:04,800
book club mainlined into middle-class moms and primarily their daughters and somewhat their sons

90
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:13,200
for the last several, you know, decades, is all Gnostic New Thought. And the New Thought movement

91
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:17,760
itself, by the way, has been recognized as a world religion now. It's not recognized in the

92
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:25,680
United States specifically as a religion, but it is recognized as a world religion

93
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:31,680
by the international body that certifies these things. So I want to thank particularly Lisa

94
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:37,360
Logan for showing me this. I mean, I wasn't digging into Robert Mueller, I probably should have been,

95
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:42,960
but she started to, and she showed me this, and she's helped me understand and link out all the

96
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:48,240
connections between Robert Mueller and the United Nations to the evolutionary leaders, which she's

97
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:52,960
researching tremendously right now, and to the Gnostic New Thought movement, which she's

98
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:58,240
researching right now. And she got into chasing all this down basically by pursuing the Alice

99
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:02,800
Bailey stuff that we were talking about about a year ago, and so a little over a year ago now,

100
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:09,040
like a year and a half ago. So this is deep and dark stuff, and I'm barely skimming the surface

101
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:14,400
of it. And I really want to thank Lisa Logan for all the work she's doing and for bringing this to

102
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:17,360
my attention so that I can bring it to your attention. But if you really want to want the

103
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:20,880
deep dives on this, she's already been putting some of it out, and she's going to be putting a

104
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:24,480
lot more of it out, she's going to really expose this. You need to go follow and pay attention

105
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:29,360
to Lisa Logan. So she's at I Am Lisa Logan. Everything's spelled the way you think it is.

106
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:35,680
That's on the X, and you can figure her out further from there. She's doing an amazing job

107
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:41,280
digging this stuff up and making us understand it. So she sent me this condensed document that is

108
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:48,480
59 pages of a summary for 2000 ideas and dreams for a better world. And I have stuck to that

109
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:52,480
document, even though when you go read the all 2000 of the ideas, like there are some other

110
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:57,680
ones that are so insane that it was super hard not to add them. It's very hard not to read basically

111
00:10:57,680 --> 00:11:02,960
all of this, which would take like weeks of podcasts to get through all of it. There's 2000

112
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:12,960
of them. But anyway, this document was originally published and sent with its full reply on March

113
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:20,080
17, 1999. It says it begins with a handful of letters back and forth between Robert Muller

114
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:26,320
and the Office of the Secretary General of the United Nations. And it says, Dear Robert,

115
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:32,000
your thoughtful letter and book ideas and dreams for a better world arrived. The Secretary General

116
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:36,720
wishes to thank you for the dedication and inspiration you continue to give to the cause of

117
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:43,440
peace, justice, and freedom. Your dynamic and eloquent leadership gives you courage or sorry,

118
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:48,720
gives courage to so many who share our goals. The Secretary General looks forward to reading

119
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:54,640
your book with care and ask that I convey your views to other officials. So why I included this

120
00:11:54,640 --> 00:12:00,640
little letter reply from the beginning is to frame who Robert Muller is. He's a very important

121
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:06,640
character. The Secretary General has a direct correspondence with him. He wishes to thank

122
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:14,480
Robert Muller for his dedication and inspiration. And he can he applauds Robert Muller's dynamic

123
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:21,360
and eloquent leadership. And in particular, though, this is what he says is that he this dynamic and

124
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:27,280
eloquent leadership gives courage. And I quote to so many who share our goals. Well, what are those

125
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:33,360
goals? This is an occult theosophy document. As you're going to hear, what are the goals of the

126
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:38,240
United Nations? That's the question that this really raises. And I want to point out, it says,

127
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:42,320
the Secretary General looks forward to reading your book with care and ask that I convey your

128
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:48,560
views to other officials. So this is in March, 1999, March 17, 1999. As a matter of fact,

129
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:55,520
my thought is, almost all of this horrific stuff, whether it's ESG, guess what year that was created

130
00:12:55,520 --> 00:13:01,520
2003. Comprehensive Sexuality Education, 2003. A bunch of the other UNESCO and UN initiatives

131
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:06,960
that are actually shaping the global agenda that we're all getting put through right now,

132
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:13,680
all started in 2003, which is a few years down the road from this. Did this inform those? That's a

133
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:19,520
legitimate question at this point. The reorganization and kind of pedal to the metal of the United

134
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:23,840
Nations, which at the time would have been pushing agenda 21. So what's the relevance of the timing?

135
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:29,600
The idea was that by the year 2021, which did not succeed, that we would enter into a new world.

136
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:34,000
That was the idea of agenda 21. And it was based off of what we're called the Millennium Development

137
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:38,880
Goals, which preceded the Sustainable Development Goals. Okay. And there were eight of those,

138
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:42,880
there are 17 Sustainable Development Goals, I will remind you with their magic number 17.

139
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:50,800
So I'm strongly suspicious that the reason that it all started in 2003,

140
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:56,320
and this goes 2003 plus 17 is 2020. So they have a 17 year long cycle in order to try to

141
00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:04,800
implement agenda 21 so that the new world starts on, it starts in, I don't know what date they

142
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:10,240
would have picked specifically within the year, but in 2021. Much like we're supposed to have a

143
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:16,000
new world now as they delayed it and pushed it back in 2030. That's why they call it the 17

144
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:23,280
Sustainable Development Goals are for 2030. It's literally called agenda 2030. People want to say

145
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:27,760
you're a conspiracy theorist, is it a conspiracy? If it's like literally an agenda, wouldn't the

146
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:31,840
people be working on the agenda? Wouldn't the secretary general looks forward to reading your

147
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:36,320
book with care and ask that I convey your views to other officials because it gives leaders,

148
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:40,480
or sorry, it gives courage to so many who share our goals. Well, what the hell are those goals?

149
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:45,360
Well, let's dive into this and see what some of this book says. But first, let me give you

150
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:51,680
some context, because the next thing in the document that was published here that I have

151
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:56,000
is that Robert Mueller, this is the response to Robert Mueller's letter, Robert Mueller then

152
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:02,160
includes his own letter that he sent. I'm not going to read all of it, obviously. And this isn't

153
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:07,840
the excerpts from the book. This is just the cover letter. And he sent that on March 6. So

154
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:15,120
again, just to underline how what a deal this guy is, Robert Mueller sent this on March 6,

155
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:21,680
1999. And 11 days later, and I'm not common claiming some numerology to that, 11 days later,

156
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:25,840
he had a response saying that it was going to be disseminated through the secretary general of the

157
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:30,640
UN and other people. So he's a very influential character. So his letter, Robert Mueller's letter,

158
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:35,920
this is Robert Mueller, starts off this way. Dear Mr. Secretary General, with the year 2000,

159
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:42,960
you are becoming the most important person on earth in the entire human history. How can you

160
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:50,320
face this overwhelming challenge in one of the most complex and messy human, earth, and evolutionary

161
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:57,440
situations this planet has ever known? Well, here are a few advices from a lifetime world

162
00:15:57,440 --> 00:16:02,640
public servant and direct aid to three former secretaries general. I'm not going to read all

163
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:08,480
these advices, which are mostly a reminder to the secretary general of his power and his importance

164
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:14,880
as what's called the Millennium Assembly for the year 2000 was approaching. So what was this

165
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:21,200
power and importance? Obviously, you are becoming the most important person on earth in the entire

166
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:29,120
human history because of the year 2000 is what Mueller said to the guy. And in terms of what

167
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:36,240
the complex, messy human, earth, and evolutionary situations, the most complex ones that the earth

168
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:42,400
has ever known. And so he's reminding him of his power in terms of getting all of the world's

169
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:48,720
leaders on the same page as their agenda. And so that's what that's what the advices are really

170
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:52,320
about. You need to wake up in the morning and look at yourself and realize how important your job is.

171
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:56,320
You need to get the other world leaders on board with what we're doing. We need as many of them as

172
00:16:56,320 --> 00:17:00,400
possible. That's your role. We have to prepare for the Millennium Assembly. That's the kind of

173
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:05,920
advices that are there. And I'm laughing that he called it advices, plural instead of advice.

174
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:11,760
So then after indicating that the secretary general should have all of his officers read all

175
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:18,880
four volumes of this 2000 ideas, and to incorporate as many of them are useful into the Millennium

176
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:24,960
Assembly, which is supposed to set the trajectory for the United Nations in the new millennium. So

177
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:30,480
in some sense, not just for the 21st century, but all the way to the year 3000, presuming like I

178
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:34,800
told you a minute ago that Robert Mueller believed that there would be UN global governance till

179
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:44,320
the year 3000, a millennium of this tyranny. After urging that all the officers read this 2000 ideas

180
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:49,760
book that I'm going to share from, he then notes that the purpose of this particular document that

181
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:56,400
he's sending, which is an excerpt from the four volumes, is to relay 59 pages of the ideas that

182
00:17:56,400 --> 00:18:02,080
he wrote in 2000 ideas that are pertinent to a global religious movement. And I'm telling you,

183
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:05,760
it's a cult theosophy. And that's what we're going to focus on. In fact, we're going to focus hard

184
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:10,880
on that one magic word there, evolutionary. Because that's what these people think that

185
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:14,320
they're doing. And like I said, Robert Mueller organized a group that are called the evolutionary

186
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:19,360
leaders that believe that they're going to be able to direct the spiritual evolution of man

187
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:24,720
in the correct direction. Now, I will point out that theosophists throughout history have believed

188
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:30,000
this. The Gnostics believed this. The ancient Hermeticists believe this. Karl Marx believed

189
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:34,320
this. The point of seizing the means of economic production was that Karl Marx believed that the

190
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:39,840
means of economic production produced economic conditions. And economic conditions produced

191
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:45,520
people. It produced who you were. So if you seize and transform the means of economic production,

192
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:51,440
you seize the means of producing man to be different. In fact, to become socialist or

193
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:57,920
eventually communist, ideally, which is a spiritual evolution because Marx's idea is that communism

194
00:18:57,920 --> 00:19:03,920
in its true form is the, in his words, positive transcendence of private property as human

195
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:09,520
self-estrangement. So in other words, it is a Marx believed that we're going to seize the means of

196
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:19,600
production of man so that we transcend our fallen form of private property owning individuals.

197
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:26,080
We're going to go back into a unified social and creative entity, mass entity, collective entity,

198
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:32,000
where we are our own creators, direct our own evolution. And the end point of that evolution

199
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:39,280
is this liberated communist utopia. And this isn't that far off. This is a another branch

200
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:44,640
on the same tree. I'm not calling this guy a Marxist. I don't think he is. I think he's another

201
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:51,040
branch on the same theosophical tree. That's what this document is actually about is

202
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:58,720
communicating 59 pages worth of these crackpot ideas. And I had to do some work to select down

203
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:04,080
to just staying under 10,000 words of them pertinent to a global religious movement.

204
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:10,960
And that global religious movement's purpose is to direct the future evolution of man. There's

205
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:19,440
a word for that. It's called eugenics. Evolutionary leaders could be called eugenics leaders very

206
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:25,120
easily. It's like a rebrand to hide what they really are. But I want to stress that the goal

207
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:30,240
is not whether it's communism, whether it's new thought, the goal, whether it's Margaret Sanger's

208
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:35,440
Planned Parenthood, which is another branch on this same tree. The goal is not and Alice Bailey

209
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:40,880
made this very clear. And I talked about this in the WTF is SEL podcast as well about Alice Bailey.

210
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:48,240
The goal is not to direct the physical evolution of man. So so much to say Alice Bailey called that

211
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:55,760
exoteric eugenics and said it's not good. It's to direct the spiritual evolution of man, which is

212
00:20:56,480 --> 00:21:01,920
of course co constituted or intrinsically interwoven with the physical evolution of man.

213
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:06,880
So the goal is actually to direct man on a spiritual level, but we have to work with the

214
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:13,520
crude means that we have. In other words, as above so below, so the spiritual level of man

215
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:21,520
imprints on his physical form and as below so above. So we work with the physical forms. We work

216
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:28,160
with physical things to direct the spiritual evolution as below so above. And when that happens,

217
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:33,280
just like Karl Marx believed in the cycle of man creates society, creates man, creates society,

218
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:38,880
here we have the idea that we're going to direct the consciousness of man until the

219
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:44,320
consciousness of man changes spiritual evolution. And that will cause a new man to arise who's more

220
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:48,880
in line with that level of spirituality. And their goal is to push us into a new age,

221
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:55,040
which just so happens to be under their control. Because of their global world, I want to say

222
00:21:55,040 --> 00:21:59,440
religion that there's the word they're kind of using it, but it's a cult. This is the largest

223
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:04,080
cult startup in the history of the world. And ultimately, the theosophical religions across

224
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:11,840
the board all have the exact same idea that the fundamental human right is to be back in the

225
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:18,240
Garden of Eden. We have a fundamental right to a liberated utopia. So when you hear them talk about

226
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:23,280
our human rights or whatever, then you say, well, they just seem to make up a new right like every

227
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:28,320
other day. This is right. That's right. Everything's an intrinsic right. What they believe is that they

228
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:34,640
have an intrinsic right to live in utopia. And literally, it's to, if we go kind of deeper into

229
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:42,240
the old theosophical religions, that to re-enter into the Garden of Eden, that the God that kicked

230
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:47,920
us out is some kind of an evil demagogic being, or it's a result of a cosmic negative accident that

231
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:54,560
kicked us out of our inheritance in the perfected utopia of Eden. And that we have an inalienable

232
00:22:54,560 --> 00:23:02,960
right to live in Eden that we have been alienated from because of a cruel and wicked circumstance

233
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:10,320
of whatever caused us to fall in the past. It was the serpent luring us to eat the fruit of the tree

234
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:16,480
of the knowledge of good and evil, and then God kicked us out, which is characterized as an evil

235
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:23,040
act and proof that the God portrayed in Genesis as a demon, or with Marx as the advent of private

236
00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:28,640
property and the individualism that follows from it. With the queer theory, it would be the advent of

237
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:34,160
people believing they can define what it means to be normal for a human being, and thus falling into

238
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:39,520
the same kind of situation and estranging one another. But their belief is that we have a

239
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:45,360
fundamental inalienable right to re-enter the Garden of Eden. And that happens by advancing our

240
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:54,320
spiritual and collective societal human evolution into the direction indicated by their religious

241
00:23:54,320 --> 00:24:00,560
crack pottery. So like I said, it is the largest cult startup in the history of the world. And my

242
00:24:00,560 --> 00:24:05,840
essential claim, just to put it very bluntly in this podcast, is that at least in this century,

243
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:11,360
so at least for the last two decades and maybe a little more, the United Nations has been

244
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:18,400
devoted to this goal and has been devoted to being the headquarters for this cult movement,

245
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:22,080
with all of its power, all of its extensions. And so there's no reason that we should be

246
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:28,480
participating in the United Nations whatsoever. It is a cult theosophical organization. That's

247
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:34,480
my hypothesis. So just another snippet from Muller, before we get down to these ideas, he says,

248
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:39,920
with Dr. Karen Singh of India, we have just created a world commission on global consciousness and

249
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:47,120
spirituality to promote a much needed spiritual renaissance. That's the goal of this document.

250
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:52,320
That's the goal of what the United Nations was setting up around the year 2000, up to 2003,

251
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:57,680
when they started pushing all of this stuff. He says, I'm sending other members an excerpt of

252
00:24:57,680 --> 00:25:03,760
59 pages of ideas regarding religion and spirituality similar to the one on the future and

253
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:10,320
futures capitalized here. So that's this document. That's the 59 pages. This document is the 59 pages

254
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:15,520
of what Robert Muller thinks the United Nations needs to understand about religion and spirituality

255
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:20,160
and what it should look like in the 21st century and actually in the entire third millennium.

256
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:24,480
And it's all connected to something that they call their world commission on global consciousness

257
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:29,600
and spirituality. There's that consciousness word. That's a theosophical tell that there's

258
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:34,320
some secret consciousness that you awaken to that if you don't have it, you're basically like cattle.

259
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:42,480
And this document is meant to be issued in pursuit of a, quote, much needed spiritual renaissance.

260
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:49,840
Like I said, he then goes on to note that he says, these are Robert Muller's 2000 ideas

261
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:57,920
started on 11 July 1994, 2000 days before 1 January 2000. So I'd only bring it up because

262
00:25:57,920 --> 00:26:04,560
I want to point out to you how invested they are in symbolism. It's not a hard calculation,

263
00:26:04,560 --> 00:26:08,560
but it's a calculation. You have to sit down and very intentionally decide to figure out which

264
00:26:08,560 --> 00:26:16,480
day on the calendar is 2000 days before January 1, 2000. And that day happened to work out

265
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:24,320
mathematically to July 11, 1994. And that was the day he decided to start writing 2000 ideas

266
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:28,800
for the 21st century. He didn't write one idea a day, even though that seems to be it.

267
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:33,440
He wrote on average one idea per day, but he also is proud that he finished a little bit

268
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:39,840
early. And that's why he was able to submit this on the 6th of March 1999 instead of having to wait

269
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:44,960
until, you know, December or something. And so this document I'm about to read from is exactly

270
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:50,160
what Muller indicates. It's 59 pages totaling perhaps a couple hundred of these 2000 ideas

271
00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:54,560
that he considers specifically essential to a spiritual renaissance for the world,

272
00:26:54,560 --> 00:27:00,560
meant to be facilitated and coordinated into a single world religion through the United Nations.

273
00:27:00,560 --> 00:27:04,960
I am not going to read all of the ideas, all the few hundred ideas in this, I'm not going to read

274
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:08,880
them in order either because that would bury the lead. Now I am burying the lead a little bit,

275
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:12,960
but I want to give you a flavor of it. And we're going to, of course, build in the level of crazy.

276
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:16,640
So stick with me. But I'm going to start with some of the ideas further down on the list.

277
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:21,440
And then kind of return to some earlier ones with a couple of exceptions. I'm going to do

278
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:25,920
a couple right from the very beginning, just to give you an idea, because it's again relevant

279
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:30,960
to understanding who Robert Muller is and what much of his life work involved. And I just want

280
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:37,360
you to keep in the back of your mind all along. This is the guy who created the education program

281
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:45,600
that became Common Core. This is the guy who created Common Core. So idea 105 written on the

282
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:53,680
23rd of October, 1994. For the sake of this planet and humanity's future, an office of global

283
00:27:53,680 --> 00:28:00,640
education should be created in every ministry of education. Global education should be required in

284
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:06,960
all schools of earth, from kindergarten to university, and in all professional schools,

285
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:12,640
especially for journalism and the media. So he understood very clearly that messaging

286
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:18,880
apparatuses and schools, messaging apparatuses need to be captured through their schools,

287
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:22,720
and he understood that schools themselves need to be turned into brainwashing apparatuses

288
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:26,480
for his global education. And that's the Common Core program that he invented.

289
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:32,400
So then that's idea 105, idea 103, which he wrote two days earlier on the 21st of October, 1994.

290
00:28:33,280 --> 00:28:39,040
While the exact sciences are all of a global universal nature, the social sciences are not.

291
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:45,600
Now, reflecting what we just talked about with George Soros, who published the book Alchemy of

292
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:51,440
Finance, arguing exactly the same thing two years before this. While the exact sciences are all of

293
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:58,240
a global universal nature, the social sciences are not, there is urgent need for a global anthropology,

294
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:06,080
global sociology, global psychology, global political science that he calls planetetics.

295
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:13,440
Did I say that right? No, planetics, sorry, planetics, planet ICS, planetics, sorry,

296
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:22,160
global literature, global art, global culture, global philosophy, global futurology, etc.

297
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:29,360
Margaret Mead was the first prophet recommending it. Now, Margaret Mead is the anthropologist who

298
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:35,680
went around and is basically the mother of cultural relativism, which is this kind of idea that

299
00:29:36,160 --> 00:29:41,440
matriculated strongly into the social sciences and in particular into the postmodern theory

300
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:48,160
that says that no culture can judge one another. And this actually dovetails very nicely with these

301
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:54,160
occult theosophical ideas, which is that there's exactly one religion, thus there's exactly one

302
00:29:54,160 --> 00:30:00,720
philosophy, there's exactly one science, there's exactly one faith, there's exactly one culture.

303
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:06,800
And what that actually is, is what they called the Priska Theologia, the ancient theology, which

304
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:15,280
is the occult theology that is frankly flat out denied by the Bible. So we're not looking in

305
00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:19,760
good directions here so far. So let me just give you, now that we've had a lot of preamble,

306
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:26,240
throat clearing, etc., let me just give you the trigger warning, I guess, what is going to sound

307
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:32,640
like an old 1950s TV show, or maybe unsolved mysteries from the 1980s. What you are about to

308
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:38,560
hear will disturb you. It's true. What you're about to hear will actually probably disturb you.

309
00:30:38,560 --> 00:30:46,640
My only commentary then in setting out is, I want you to keep in mind, this is the real United

310
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:51,200
Nations. When we look under the hood of the UN, this is what we're dealing with. Even with all

311
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:57,840
the positive aspirational language, this is disturbing. This is a cult theosophy trying to

312
00:30:57,840 --> 00:31:05,360
create a world cult religion that we're all stuck inside. And it's, in fact, a transformational

313
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:13,040
religion, a transmutational religion, a evolutionary religion. And so they mean to seize the means of

314
00:31:13,040 --> 00:31:19,920
human spiritual production and societal production, such that we will move into our next evolutionary

315
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:25,520
phase. And that's the goal of the United Nations, at least in the 21st century and third millennium.

316
00:31:25,520 --> 00:31:29,440
So let's start with some stuff we generally already know about the UN and its agendas,

317
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:35,040
so we don't overwhelm too quickly, so that we can kind of understand how to orient what we already

318
00:31:35,040 --> 00:31:39,440
know about the United Nations in terms of what Mueller is indicating is underneath those agendas,

319
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:44,080
which is the occult theosophy that this podcast is about. So as a result, I'm going to start near

320
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:51,680
the end of the document with idea 1912. The creation, he says, by the Rio de Janeiro Conference

321
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:57,200
of an Earth Council, so we're all familiar that a lot of this environmental sustainability crap

322
00:31:57,200 --> 00:32:02,880
all got kicked off and coordinated at the Rio conference, the Earth Council, in 1992.

323
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:08,880
So the creation of the Rio de Janeiro Conference of an Earth Council is a great step ahead in

324
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:15,680
human history. One of its first tasks is to draft an Earth charter. An admirable text of that charter

325
00:32:15,680 --> 00:32:22,960
is now in circulation among non-governmental organizations, NGOs, for their comments. It

326
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:29,600
opens a completely new chapter of world charters. So here's where the NGOs become the relevant bodies

327
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:36,080
to push all of this crap. We also need a charter for the seas and oceans, a charter for outer space,

328
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:40,960
for the air and atmosphere, for the world's waters, for mountain areas, and for arid zones,

329
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:46,560
for the world's forestry covers, for the world's vegetation, for other species, for human settlements,

330
00:32:46,560 --> 00:32:54,080
etc. A vast new field of human philosophy, behavior, and future evolution has been opened,

331
00:32:54,080 --> 00:33:01,920
the fundamental rights of the Earth. So all of this sustainable crap follows straight from this,

332
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:07,600
and you hear what they're after, governance of everything in a evolutionary,

333
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:13,280
theosophical sense, governance of everything, the seas, the oceans, outer space, the air,

334
00:33:13,280 --> 00:33:21,520
the atmosphere, the water, mountains, deserts, forests, vegetation, all the species, human

335
00:33:21,520 --> 00:33:28,560
settlements, they want control over all of it. And we see exactly those kinds of things coming down

336
00:33:28,560 --> 00:33:34,000
the pike today. That's exactly what they're working with with this kind of new Earth charter.

337
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:44,560
So idea 1930. The UN General Assembly 2000 at the heads of states level must absolutely measure

338
00:33:44,560 --> 00:33:50,720
up to its historical tasks and be remembered for its audacity and long-term views of the future.

339
00:33:51,280 --> 00:33:57,360
It should above all decide to embark on the writing of a constitution for proper Earth

340
00:33:57,440 --> 00:34:05,280
government. If it does not, future historians will not forgive its members. So in the year 2000,

341
00:34:05,280 --> 00:34:11,440
the United Nations General Assembly is tasked, at least in this idea, with embarking on the writing

342
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:16,720
of a new constitution for proper Earth government. Which does what? What the previous thing said.

343
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:23,840
It opens up a vast new field of human philosophy, behavior, and future evolution

344
00:34:23,840 --> 00:34:28,800
in the fundamental rights of the Earth. So the constitution, that's supposed to be for global

345
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:34,240
government, that they're supposed to write in the year 2000, is designed to push the fundamental

346
00:34:34,240 --> 00:34:40,400
rights of the Earth. And he says if it does not, future historians will not forgive its members.

347
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:44,240
Well, it turns out future historians are probably not going to forgive its members,

348
00:34:44,240 --> 00:34:51,920
but it's not because they did not. It's because they did. Idea 1931. At this stage of our evolution,

349
00:34:51,920 --> 00:34:57,920
the concept of completion and survival of, sorry, I messed that up. At this stage of our evolution,

350
00:34:57,920 --> 00:35:04,400
so let's let's frame our heads here. He's talking directly about our evolution. That means mankind's

351
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:11,200
evolution. At this stage of our evolution, the concept of competition and survival of the fittest

352
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:18,800
must be abandoned in favor of the concept of cooperation. Oh, hello Carl Marx. Hello all the

353
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:27,520
theosophists. The world future evolution of the Earth and of humanity depends on it. Only

354
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:34,960
cooperation will save the Earth and humanity. From now on, cooperation must be the supreme law of

355
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:43,520
Earth and human survival. We must aim at a united Earth and nature. There's the seed right there

356
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:48,240
for the 17 Sustainable Development Goals and how they operate. And he's not just calling for a global

357
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:52,880
government to be set up through the United Nations and organized in line with extending the 1992 Rio

358
00:35:52,880 --> 00:36:00,640
de Janeiro Earth Council Accord, but that it must also direct the, I should say redirect, the mechanisms

359
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:08,080
of evolution of humanity specifically. Never mind the laws of nature. Never mind nature's god. Never

360
00:36:08,080 --> 00:36:14,560
mind a biblical god for sure. It is now time for a whole new principle that just so happens to be

361
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:21,840
cooperation, aka communism, but kind of elevated communism, above communism even. And I want to

362
00:36:21,840 --> 00:36:27,440
stress this point that this evolution is meant in a spiritual sense. The goal is to change the

363
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:33,680
consciousness of man so that man behaves differently. And through changing consciousness and through

364
00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:40,720
changing how we behave, we become new people, a new species, a more advanced species. And in fact,

365
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:44,560
we become a communal species. And that's very important. These evolutionary leaders that I

366
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:50,160
mentioned before that he organized, this is very important because they actually see it that here's

367
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:54,480
the idea. And I'm stealing from Lisa here. So this is going to be a little bit rough. Lisa Logan,

368
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:59,520
again, I am Lisa Logan. You should go follow her. So the general idea is they say, well,

369
00:37:00,080 --> 00:37:06,160
look at what you have. You have these bacteria and the bacteria start to make colonies and groups

370
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:09,520
and they group together. This is a real video. She'll show you the real video eventually. There's

371
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:13,840
a real video I've seen of this guy given this lecture. So this isn't us riffing. There's also

372
00:37:13,840 --> 00:37:18,560
books explaining this. So the bacteria form, you know, various colonies or whatever. And some of

373
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:22,000
the colonies figure out that if they share resources in certain ways, that they're more

374
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:27,040
successful. And so they can now compete the other ones. So bacteria colonies, which are kind of

375
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:32,800
communities of bacteria do better. And eventually, a thing called a biofilm can form around them so

376
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:37,920
that the colony itself becomes sort of a single entity. And then the various different bacteria

377
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:42,880
within it can specialize to do this or do that or do the other thing for the collective. And then

378
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:46,960
what you end up with is something like an amoeba, you end up with a more complex organism. And that's

379
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:51,760
one step in an evolutionary spiral that happens to look exactly like all the evolutionary hermetic

380
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:56,800
spirals that I've put on Twitter over time, like they literally use the same graphic and

381
00:37:56,800 --> 00:38:01,280
outcomes a new species. And this is how evolutionary leaps to higher order creatures,

382
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:06,400
they say are made. And so eventually amoebas form colonies or something that are like amoebas form

383
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:10,640
colonies, and they get a biofilm, and then you have a more complex organism and on and up until

384
00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:14,000
you end up with animals, and then you end up with mammals, and then you end up with human beings.

385
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:18,560
And so they think that we're at the stage. And this is the point of their evolutionary idea,

386
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:24,320
where human beings themselves are ready to take the next evolutionary leap into a

387
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:30,880
global collective. And the biofilm, we've already formed communities, but the biofilm that ties us

388
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:36,720
together that makes us all into one thing is the internet. And the internet can be directed so that

389
00:38:37,360 --> 00:38:43,440
within all the different communities of people, start to work together for one global program.

390
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:50,080
And so we are meant to become one super organism on the earth. And in fact, in alignment with the earth

391
00:38:50,080 --> 00:38:57,920
as part of the earth. And that's what their their idea of evolution is. But to get people to do this,

392
00:38:57,920 --> 00:39:01,600
they have to elevate their thinking. In other words, they have to have consciousness

393
00:39:01,600 --> 00:39:06,480
raising. In other words, they have to have evolution of consciousness into a global and even as we're

394
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:11,840
going to hear cosmic consciousness, or astral consciousness that goes above that, and can picture

395
00:39:11,840 --> 00:39:18,320
humanity operating as a global collective. Again, I urge you to realize that this is the exact same

396
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:23,120
program Karl Marx was was banging on about. Karl just had a different method and a different

397
00:39:23,120 --> 00:39:28,640
formulation. But it's the exact same method that we are all the same. We're all the same

398
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:34,480
collective, we're all intrinsically meant to be working together. But only the spiritually

399
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:39,040
advanced what Karl Marx called socialists can actually see it. And here, it's going to be

400
00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:44,720
people with cosmic consciousness. And he is dead serious that the purpose of the United Nations

401
00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:50,880
going forward is going to be to direct the spiritual evolution of man into a single global

402
00:39:50,880 --> 00:40:00,240
collective in a single transformational that is heretical, evil world religion. So let's skip

403
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:04,160
straight to the end and read idea 2000. And we're going to see this is pretty explicit. He says,

404
00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:11,280
from our current world pessimism, we can be saved and uplifted by this personal conclusion I arrived

405
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:19,760
at an idea 552. Namely, perhaps out of my passion for life and for this miraculous earth, a new

406
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:25,760
theory of evolution can be shaped. Namely, that with our recently acquired tremendous human

407
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:31,440
knowledge of the universe and of our planet, we will henceforth be more than the mere preservers

408
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:38,080
and savers of the earth, but will be her instruments, her most advanced evolutionary agents, her

409
00:40:38,080 --> 00:40:44,720
children endowed with the evolutionary task to make it an even more astonishing planet and cosmic

410
00:40:44,720 --> 00:40:51,600
evolutionary success, perhaps the most advanced ultimate masterpiece in the universe and God.

411
00:40:52,720 --> 00:40:57,600
Since each species born from nature is a miracle, we are certainly a miracle too.

412
00:40:57,600 --> 00:41:04,080
What great excitement it will be when in the year 2000 humanity will accept this as its new,

413
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:11,920
all encompassing common objective for the 21st century to make this earth a paradise,

414
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:17,680
to make humanity a miracle. So I'm not kidding. That's literally what he's about.

415
00:41:18,320 --> 00:41:22,000
That's literally the program. So let's make something extremely clear.

416
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:29,360
Going to remind you of a word I already used. An intentional theory of evolution for mankind

417
00:41:29,360 --> 00:41:34,080
is eugenics. Let me say that again, because that's what the United Nations through Robert Mueller is

418
00:41:34,080 --> 00:41:38,560
advocating for. And like I said, this is the real United Nations, at least in this century,

419
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:43,360
I think maybe all along. I seriously think that, but at least in this century. Let me just say

420
00:41:43,360 --> 00:41:48,880
that sentence one more time and I'll say it slowly so it sinks in. An intentional theory of evolution

421
00:41:48,880 --> 00:42:00,320
for mankind is eugenics. The call for man to complete God's creation is esoteric occult

422
00:42:00,320 --> 00:42:06,640
theosophy. We could talk about whether it's inspired from hermetic ideas. You hear the idea

423
00:42:06,720 --> 00:42:13,920
straight up, the Gnostic concept in idea number 2000 here. From our current world pessimism,

424
00:42:14,720 --> 00:42:23,680
we can be saved and uplifted by this secret knowledge that we can actually have a

425
00:42:24,560 --> 00:42:29,040
directed evolution to become the ultimate masterpiece of the universe and God.

426
00:42:29,600 --> 00:42:37,280
So let me make that real clear. This is eugenics. This is the real United Nations and its operating

427
00:42:37,280 --> 00:42:43,520
system is a call for man to complete God's creation, which is esoteric occult theosophy.

428
00:42:44,560 --> 00:42:51,200
This is, we should have nothing to do with this organization. It is not merely a meeting place

429
00:42:51,200 --> 00:42:55,840
for governance to figure out global treaties and things like that. It's nothing of the kind.

430
00:42:56,400 --> 00:43:02,720
And he's extremely serious about this and devotes many of his ideas to making this a reality

431
00:43:02,720 --> 00:43:09,840
through his vision for a United Nations-centered world government. Let's read 1904. Idea number

432
00:43:09,840 --> 00:43:16,240
1904. I recommend that a totally new world organization should be considered for our

433
00:43:16,240 --> 00:43:23,120
earth and humanity. A world organization of evolution into which the United Nations could

434
00:43:23,120 --> 00:43:29,280
be incorporated. This organization would listen to evolutionary scientists who look at evolution

435
00:43:29,280 --> 00:43:35,440
in its multiplicity of forms, from the smallest bacteria to the evolution of humankind,

436
00:43:35,440 --> 00:43:42,160
within the basic elements of the planet, its airs, its water, its climate, etc., and who have a long

437
00:43:42,160 --> 00:43:48,800
term view, Gnostic, who have a long term view of what the future evolution of this planet is likely to be.

438
00:43:49,120 --> 00:43:54,880
This is indispensable because henceforth everything on this planet has to be seen in terms of a long

439
00:43:54,880 --> 00:44:03,040
term future evolution. Our species is now in charge of the earth's future evolution. If we stick to

440
00:44:03,040 --> 00:44:11,040
obsolete values, we will put an end to it. But if we adopt new values, new objectives, visions,

441
00:44:11,040 --> 00:44:19,200
institutions, and laws, evolution will continue. This is henceforth problem number one on this

442
00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:27,440
planet. Everything else has to abide to it. It then continues this thought in Idea 1905. The new

443
00:44:27,440 --> 00:44:33,600
world organization of evolution would issue yearly reports on the state of evolution of our

444
00:44:33,600 --> 00:44:39,680
planet, review the prospects of the future, and recommend corrective actions, including emergency

445
00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:49,440
measures and world laws. Idea 1906. The most important single step that could help save the

446
00:44:49,440 --> 00:44:55,680
earth and humanity would be to create in each government a ministry of the future, and in the

447
00:44:55,680 --> 00:45:02,000
United Nations and in each of its agencies a department and commission of the future. It would

448
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:08,400
be the first step toward the creation of a world organization of evolution. It is good that the

449
00:45:08,480 --> 00:45:14,800
European Union had the vision to create a position of commissioner for the future. May this good

450
00:45:14,800 --> 00:45:19,520
example be followed by many institutions around the world, public and private.

451
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:28,960
ESG serves that role, by the way, in a slightly different capacity without necessarily a direct

452
00:45:29,760 --> 00:45:35,200
department. That's what ESG was designed to do. Besides the redirecting of money and impact

453
00:45:35,200 --> 00:45:43,360
investing, ESG was designed to assess the long-term viability in terms of environmental and social

454
00:45:44,480 --> 00:45:54,880
programs plus corporate governance practices. Idea 1907. When one considers the vital importance

455
00:45:54,880 --> 00:46:02,000
of the future evolution of this planet and of humanity, it would be also important to create

456
00:46:02,080 --> 00:46:08,400
a world university of evolution and the future, or at least faculties of evolution and the future

457
00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:14,240
in all universities. When I did that episode not that long ago, where I talked about the UNESCO

458
00:46:14,240 --> 00:46:18,720
document, it was a series of four, the strange death of the university, where I talked about how

459
00:46:18,720 --> 00:46:23,360
the sustainable development goals were to be incorporated completely into university education,

460
00:46:23,360 --> 00:46:30,960
ASAP, at all levels. There you go. This stuff is crazy, but it gets way crazier than this. We're

461
00:46:30,960 --> 00:46:37,040
not even close to crazy. I'm going to skip to the first part of super crazy. This might be the

462
00:46:37,040 --> 00:46:43,600
craziest part. I showed this to Charlie Kirk, and he was just like, what? What? Whoa. Whoa.

463
00:46:44,640 --> 00:46:50,640
Overwhelming. It's this freaking crazy. I want my Christian audience to listen very carefully to

464
00:46:50,640 --> 00:46:56,080
what this says, because I need you to understand how off the rails the United Nations is and how

465
00:46:56,080 --> 00:47:00,720
out of step. Why are they attacking Christianity so hard? You just heard the old values are going

466
00:47:00,800 --> 00:47:04,800
to kill the planet. The old beliefs are going to kill the planet. We have to get rid of them.

467
00:47:04,800 --> 00:47:10,960
So what does he propose here? It's not just that he intends his vision to be moved by the

468
00:47:10,960 --> 00:47:17,520
governments, but very explicitly intends it to be moved by a single new world religion coordinated

469
00:47:18,160 --> 00:47:24,160
as an evolutionary religion, that is occult theosophy, headquartered through the United

470
00:47:24,160 --> 00:47:29,200
Nations or through a new body that the United Nations is incorporated into. And the goal is to,

471
00:47:29,200 --> 00:47:34,320
for him, and I'm not kidding, listen, the goal for him is to envision the United Nations as the

472
00:47:34,320 --> 00:47:40,880
body that is tasked with resetting the world. A great reset, right? Resetting the world with a new

473
00:47:40,880 --> 00:47:45,840
creation. I mean that because the next thing he talks about, at least that I'm going to tell you

474
00:47:45,840 --> 00:47:50,240
about, these are from ideas we were just in the 1900s, we're skipping back to the 1300s,

475
00:47:51,120 --> 00:47:58,560
he literally talks about the concept of a United Nations centered new genesis. Genesis is the first

476
00:47:58,560 --> 00:48:05,120
book of the Bible. Genesis 1 and 2 describe the creation of the world. If you recall your Genesis

477
00:48:05,120 --> 00:48:09,840
1, he talks about the seven days in which God created the world, the six in which he created

478
00:48:09,840 --> 00:48:16,240
it and the seventh upon which he saw that it was good and rested. So pulling from ideas 1301 to

479
00:48:16,240 --> 00:48:21,920
1400, which he offers in a single block in this document with the heading, the spiritual state of

480
00:48:21,920 --> 00:48:31,360
the world, on Earth Day 2013, here's what he writes. Humanity is now a united world community of

481
00:48:31,360 --> 00:48:37,840
nations, not only economic and political, but also spiritual. Following the path opened in the last

482
00:48:37,840 --> 00:48:44,720
century by Doug Homerskold and by Hugh Taunt in the United Nations, by Robert Schumann in Europe,

483
00:48:44,720 --> 00:48:50,960
and also throughout the millennia by prophets and founders of religions and by great sages,

484
00:48:50,960 --> 00:49:00,320
such as Plato, Aristotle, Maimonides, Huxley, Albert Schweitzer, Dillard Deschardin, who is an

485
00:49:00,320 --> 00:49:07,280
outright hermeticist, Thomas Berry, Bishop William Swing, and others. I'm sure digging into all of

486
00:49:07,280 --> 00:49:12,080
those people will uncover that they have very questionable religious beliefs, maybe apart

487
00:49:12,080 --> 00:49:19,200
from Aristotle. Humanity's material, scientific and technological, technological feats of the

488
00:49:19,200 --> 00:49:25,760
20th century, he says, have been transcended first into the moral ethical realm, then into

489
00:49:25,760 --> 00:49:33,040
philanthropy and guiafili, love for humanity and our Earth. That's the key value, by the way,

490
00:49:33,040 --> 00:49:39,280
not just of his program, but of the degrowth communism to fix the metabolic rift that Marx

491
00:49:39,280 --> 00:49:42,800
predicted. If you go back and listen to the degrowth communism podcast that I did recently,

492
00:49:42,800 --> 00:49:48,240
you'll see it's the exact same idea, guiafili, love for humanity and for our Earth. It's all

493
00:49:48,240 --> 00:49:52,480
theosophical occultism. Marxism is just a branch of theosophical occultism that had a very

494
00:49:53,200 --> 00:50:00,240
powerful success record in installing itself politically. And so he says, sorry, humanities

495
00:50:00,880 --> 00:50:05,200
feats of the 20th century have been transcended first into the moral ethical realm, then into

496
00:50:05,200 --> 00:50:11,200
philanthropy and guiafili, and finally into the highest form of all the spiritual dimension heralded

497
00:50:11,200 --> 00:50:17,280
for so long by all religions, namely the right understanding of our place and relationship

498
00:50:17,360 --> 00:50:24,240
in the universe and in time and of our fundamental cosmic nature and role. If you needed more proof

499
00:50:24,240 --> 00:50:32,080
that this is occult theosophy, I don't know what to tell you, but he's invoking the underlying

500
00:50:32,640 --> 00:50:37,840
hermetic concept of the priesthood theologiae there, that there is this ancient world religion,

501
00:50:37,840 --> 00:50:43,840
that all sciences, all thought, all cultures, all religions, all everything are just reflections

502
00:50:43,840 --> 00:50:48,080
of. Hinduism is just doing the best it can, just like quantum physics is doing the best it can,

503
00:50:48,080 --> 00:50:54,000
to explain this one true thing about all of reality. And he thinks that we've now hit the

504
00:50:54,000 --> 00:51:00,960
point where we can actually start to articulate that. The phenomenal expansion of human senses

505
00:51:00,960 --> 00:51:05,840
and physical capabilities through science and technology was followed by the birth and development

506
00:51:05,840 --> 00:51:12,960
of a global brain, a global nervous system, a global heart, and a global soul to humanity.

507
00:51:13,040 --> 00:51:19,120
So Hegel's geist. Much remains to be done to perfect and refine these gains and to integrate

508
00:51:19,120 --> 00:51:25,200
them fully into the total life system of our living planet, skipping a bit. We came to understand

509
00:51:25,200 --> 00:51:31,520
that we are all part of a total living planet which is itself a cosmic body of the universe,

510
00:51:32,240 --> 00:51:37,680
and that in this living system we are linked not only to the earth but to each other and to the

511
00:51:37,680 --> 00:51:42,640
heavens in which we live. The miraculous transformation we have experienced in the

512
00:51:42,640 --> 00:51:48,960
progress of humanity is a result of our cooperation of the world's religions along the lines of the

513
00:51:48,960 --> 00:51:55,120
vast frameworks of our knowledge and our needed actions born in the United Nations and its agencies.

514
00:51:55,760 --> 00:52:01,040
So let's be real clear. He's saying that everything is all one, that's the occult

515
00:52:01,040 --> 00:52:06,160
theosophical view, and that it's actually coming together through the United Nations and its agencies.

516
00:52:07,040 --> 00:52:11,600
These led to a better understanding of our planet and place in the universe of our

517
00:52:11,600 --> 00:52:18,000
total human family, of our place in time, and of the miracle of individual human life.

518
00:52:18,640 --> 00:52:23,040
The last decades of the 20th century provided humanity with the global information

519
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:30,560
and first experiences indispensable for our better behavior, for better earth government,

520
00:52:30,560 --> 00:52:35,760
and for the physical, mental, moral, effective, and spiritual fulfillment of all humans

521
00:52:36,320 --> 00:52:43,040
blessed with the miracle of life. So we're going to skip a few grandiose paragraphs with

522
00:52:43,040 --> 00:52:48,320
fancy grandiose headings about the unique role of humans in place and time, and we're going to

523
00:52:48,320 --> 00:52:51,920
skip down to one of his subject headings, it's titled the miracle of individual life.

524
00:52:53,360 --> 00:52:57,360
This fourth framework, so you can guess that we skipped three, this fourth framework which

525
00:52:57,360 --> 00:53:03,120
revolves around the centrality of the human person goes far deeper and beyond human institutions.

526
00:53:03,120 --> 00:53:08,560
It has become increasingly clear that in the vast global quantum change in human consciousness,

527
00:53:08,560 --> 00:53:13,520
so does that sound like Deepak Chopra? It does. Why? Because he's one of them. He's actually

528
00:53:13,520 --> 00:53:18,240
a very important figure, he's one of them. You know about the evolutionary leaders and people

529
00:53:18,240 --> 00:53:24,080
like Deepak Chopra? Because Oprah Winfrey put them on TV all the time, dozens of times, over and over

530
00:53:24,320 --> 00:53:31,440
again and mainline them into our culture. It has become increasingly clear that in the vast

531
00:53:31,440 --> 00:53:37,280
global quantum change in human consciousness, individuals are the alpha and omega. Oh, we're

532
00:53:37,280 --> 00:53:45,920
God, okay. The basic living cosmic units of evolution. Individual, what? Don't all biological

533
00:53:45,920 --> 00:53:52,480
things evolve on the theory of evolution? But no, human beings, human consciousness,

534
00:53:53,680 --> 00:54:00,240
individuals. Individual human life is the highest form of universal consciousness. This is just the

535
00:54:00,240 --> 00:54:04,400
theosophical belief set that we are the unique creature that's able to figure out where the

536
00:54:04,400 --> 00:54:09,280
divine has been fragmented so that we can lead God to realize himself so that we eventually,

537
00:54:09,280 --> 00:54:14,240
God realizes that we are no different from one another or anything else and in fact that we

538
00:54:14,240 --> 00:54:19,920
are always God. That's literally it. Individual human life is the highest form of universal

539
00:54:19,920 --> 00:54:25,520
consciousness. With the recognition of universal human rights and responsibilities, it became apparent

540
00:54:25,520 --> 00:54:32,000
that institution systems, states, groupings, entities had no consciousness and could only be

541
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:37,440
instruments, servants, means for the increase of individual consciousness, fulfillment and

542
00:54:37,520 --> 00:54:44,800
responsibility. The highest goal for humankind is to attain optimum physical, mental, effective,

543
00:54:45,360 --> 00:54:51,280
moral, and spiritual lives as a part of the total life system of our planet.

544
00:54:52,640 --> 00:54:58,000
So are you getting the idea that this is a super crackpot religion? It is. Optimum physical life

545
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:03,360
involves knowledge and care of the human body, the human ability to see, to hear, to observe,

546
00:55:03,360 --> 00:55:10,560
to create, to do, to act, to transform, and the expansion of all senses and physical abilities.

547
00:55:11,440 --> 00:55:15,840
That's, there you go. Optimum meant that, by the way, Karl Marx says the same thing in the

548
00:55:15,840 --> 00:55:20,000
Economic Philosophic Manuscript, by the way, by the way, he says the exact same thing. It's the

549
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:26,000
exact same theosophical nonsense and I think that Karl Marx stole it from the Corpus Hermaticum.

550
00:55:26,800 --> 00:55:32,720
It's way too weird that it's in there in Karl Marx's Economic Philosophic Manuscripts and that

551
00:55:32,800 --> 00:55:38,160
it's so closely paralleled to stuff that's in the Corpus Hermaticum, which is the ancient

552
00:55:38,160 --> 00:55:44,560
Hermatic religious text, which by the way has 17 books. The 17s just keep coming up. I'm just saying

553
00:55:44,560 --> 00:55:48,720
this is exactly the same thing that's expressed there and it's not because this guy's a Marxist,

554
00:55:48,720 --> 00:55:55,120
it's because Marx was one of them. It's that they are all theosophical occultists who think that

555
00:55:55,120 --> 00:56:02,160
they have the secret knowledge and the divine right to transform man to complete creation.

556
00:56:03,280 --> 00:56:07,440
They're the alpha and the, man is the alpha and the omega, the beginning and the end, the creator

557
00:56:07,440 --> 00:56:13,600
and the conclusion. He says, optimal mental life involves knowledge and education,

558
00:56:13,600 --> 00:56:18,880
which of course they took control of, the ability to question, to think, to analyze, to synthesize,

559
00:56:20,480 --> 00:56:26,640
to synthesize, to conclude, to communicate, the ability to focus from the infinitely small to

560
00:56:26,640 --> 00:56:30,800
the infinitely large, from the local to the global, from the past to the future,

561
00:56:30,800 --> 00:56:37,120
to be what Hinduism calls trickledarshish, sorry, I can't say it, I don't know, omniscient,

562
00:56:38,080 --> 00:56:44,720
particularly all knowing across time, past, present and future, and tricholanaths,

563
00:56:45,280 --> 00:56:52,800
which is omnipotence, mastery of the three worlds. Optimum, effective and moral life

564
00:56:52,800 --> 00:56:58,000
involves the ability to love and the human virtues of truth, understanding, humility,

565
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:04,560
liberty, responsibility, reverence for life, compassion, altruism and charity. And finally,

566
00:57:04,560 --> 00:57:11,120
optimum spiritual life involves the ability for interiority, meditation, prayer, communion with

567
00:57:11,120 --> 00:57:19,840
the universe and eternity and with God. Here, the United Nations, the United Religions, UNESCO

568
00:57:19,840 --> 00:57:25,600
and other world agencies stand today in the forefront of human progress and evolution,

569
00:57:26,240 --> 00:57:32,720
in the education, information, enlightened democracy, transcendence, and fulfillment of the

570
00:57:32,720 --> 00:57:39,440
miracle of human life and its contribution and responsibility in the overall cosmic evolution

571
00:57:39,440 --> 00:57:48,320
of our planet and of the universe. We have a role in the evolution of the universe, like this is the

572
00:57:48,320 --> 00:57:55,040
most ridiculous, but it's just a cult theosophy, you've got to understand, you may not even know

573
00:57:55,040 --> 00:57:59,520
the word theosophy yet, you need to know the word theosophy because the spiritual war that

574
00:57:59,520 --> 00:58:06,240
we're in right now is theosophy versus theology. Theology is a serious pursuit of religious truth

575
00:58:06,240 --> 00:58:16,400
and theosophy is a cult. I was going to say it's an occult cult, which sounds stupid so that's why

576
00:58:16,400 --> 00:58:22,080
I stalled out there, but that's what it is, it's a cult based on occult beliefs. He says this is

577
00:58:22,080 --> 00:58:26,240
where we stand at the moment, in the year 2013, I don't know how this is in a document delivered

578
00:58:26,240 --> 00:58:31,200
in 1999, I don't know if it was added later, that's beside the point, it's in the freaking

579
00:58:31,200 --> 00:58:35,840
document, you can go look at it, I can show you the page numbers, he must have added to this

580
00:58:35,840 --> 00:58:40,720
and cobbled it together later as a kind of grouping of things that he thinks. But anyway,

581
00:58:40,720 --> 00:58:45,680
this is where we stand at the moment in the year 2013, 20 years after the second world parliament

582
00:58:45,680 --> 00:58:51,920
of religions. It represents a unique, tremendous quantum jump in consciousness and evolution of

583
00:58:51,920 --> 00:58:58,960
humanity. We know our planet inside out and we are now in charge of its future. That seems very

584
00:58:59,760 --> 00:59:06,480
taking on playing God. We even know a good part of the heavens, we have entered the cosmic age

585
00:59:06,480 --> 00:59:11,600
of our evolution. So skipping more of this waffle, because I want to get to the scary stuff.

586
00:59:12,240 --> 00:59:16,080
Similarly, the pragmatic efforts of the religions and of the united religions,

587
00:59:16,080 --> 00:59:22,080
that's an organization by the way, are complemented by a world spirituality university,

588
00:59:22,080 --> 00:59:27,600
which has developed a science of spirituality, and Alice Bailey called it the science of

589
00:59:27,600 --> 00:59:34,080
right human relations. A strategy for spirituality and a methodology of spirituality derived from

590
00:59:34,080 --> 00:59:39,440
all religious practices, celebrations and rites around the world, aimed at the spiritual fulfillment

591
00:59:39,440 --> 00:59:46,480
and responsibility of human beings. As a result, the world is in a new period of full flowering

592
00:59:46,480 --> 00:59:52,480
spiritual renaissance, far beyond inter-religious dialogue. Remember, that's what he called for

593
00:59:52,480 --> 00:59:58,880
back in 1999, and here it is in 2013, saying that we're there. Based on the common spirituality

594
00:59:58,880 --> 01:00:04,400
of all religions and on a common denominator of all human beings, the yearning for answers to the

595
01:00:04,400 --> 01:00:11,360
mysteries of life and death and of our universe, to which the scientific age, despite its amazing

596
01:00:11,360 --> 01:00:21,680
advances, was unable to find satisfying answers. The age of scientific analysis and dissection,

597
01:00:21,680 --> 01:00:27,280
our checkered history of local cultures and national divisions, the millennia of religious

598
01:00:27,280 --> 01:00:32,720
dissections and of the spiritual nature of humanity, of the earth and of the cosmos,

599
01:00:32,720 --> 01:00:39,920
have now led to a new age of universality, holism, evolutionism, and all-encompassing

600
01:00:39,920 --> 01:00:46,240
convergence, synthesis, synergy, and transcendence. That sounds like some Antichrist stuff,

601
01:00:47,040 --> 01:00:51,120
so I'm skipping a lot more after a bunch of bullet points for what this world might look like in

602
01:00:51,120 --> 01:00:56,320
practice, which probably I should cover, but this is going to be super long anyway. He says,

603
01:00:56,400 --> 01:01:03,600
at that point I looked up from the text, so he's working on laying out what this should look like.

604
01:01:03,600 --> 01:01:08,320
At that point I looked up from the text and seized a copy of a book I had written many years ago in

605
01:01:08,320 --> 01:01:13,840
the last century, meaning in the 90s, when I was a young world servant, I don't know if it's in the

606
01:01:13,840 --> 01:01:18,720
90s, so before 2000 I should say, when I was a young world servant of the United Nations,

607
01:01:19,440 --> 01:01:27,520
entitled New Genesis, Shaping a Global Spirituality, and read the following text of mine. So this is

608
01:01:27,520 --> 01:01:34,080
the vision that was guiding his thought from very early on in his world servant capacity at the

609
01:01:34,080 --> 01:01:44,560
United Nations. He said, he wrote, and God saw all the nations of the earth, black and white,

610
01:01:44,560 --> 01:01:50,480
poor and rich, from north and south, from east and west, and all of the creeds were sending

611
01:01:50,480 --> 01:01:56,240
their emissaries to a tall glass house on the shores of the river of the rising sun, on the

612
01:01:56,240 --> 01:02:02,720
island of Manhattan, to study together, to think together, and to care together for the world and

613
01:02:02,720 --> 01:02:10,080
all its people, and God said, that is good. And it was the first day of the new era of the earth.

614
01:02:11,040 --> 01:02:19,120
Pause. Where is the glass house on the, a tall glass house on the shores of the river of the

615
01:02:19,120 --> 01:02:26,560
rising sun on the island of Manhattan? Hmm, is it the United Nations building? It is. So let's

616
01:02:26,560 --> 01:02:34,960
phrase it more, more straightly. And God saw that all the nations of the earth, and all its people,

617
01:02:35,120 --> 01:02:41,280
from all its creeds, were sending their emissaries to the United Nations building

618
01:02:41,920 --> 01:02:46,480
to study together, to think together, and care together for this world and all of its people,

619
01:02:46,480 --> 01:02:53,520
and God said, that is good. And it was the first day of the new era of the earth.

620
01:02:54,320 --> 01:03:01,600
This is the United Nations. This is the UN. Time to abolish the UN. But he's not done.

621
01:03:02,480 --> 01:03:07,360
And God saw that soldiers of peace were separating the combatants of quarreling nations.

622
01:03:08,080 --> 01:03:13,600
So that's their blue hats, that differences were being resolved by negotiation and reason instead

623
01:03:13,600 --> 01:03:19,280
of arms, and that leaders of nations were seeing each other, taking to each other and joining

624
01:03:19,280 --> 01:03:25,920
their hearts, minds, souls, and strength, that's a reference to Jesus, the Gospels, for the benefit

625
01:03:25,920 --> 01:03:32,880
of all humanity. And God said, that is good. And it was the second day of the planet of peace.

626
01:03:33,840 --> 01:03:40,480
So he just compared the blue hats to Jesus' disciples by the way. And God saw that humans

627
01:03:40,480 --> 01:03:46,000
were loving the entire creation, the stars and the sun, the day and the night, the air and the

628
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:51,680
oceans, the earth and the waters, the fishes and the fowl, the flowers and the herbs, and all their

629
01:03:51,680 --> 01:03:58,560
human brethren and sisters. And God said, that is good. And it was the third day of the planet

630
01:03:58,560 --> 01:04:05,200
of happiness. And God saw that humans were suppressing hunger, disease, ignorance, and

631
01:04:05,200 --> 01:04:11,280
suffering all over the globe, providing each human person with a decent, conscious, and happy life,

632
01:04:11,280 --> 01:04:17,680
no discontious, and reducing the greed, the power, and the wealth of the few. And he said, that is

633
01:04:17,680 --> 01:04:25,600
good. And it was the fourth day of the planet of justice. And God saw that humans were living in

634
01:04:25,600 --> 01:04:31,200
harmony with their planet and in peace with one another, wisely managing their resources, avoiding

635
01:04:31,200 --> 01:04:40,000
waste, curbing excesses, replacing hatred with love, greed with contentment, arrogance with humility,

636
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:45,920
division with cooperation, and mistrust with understanding. And he said, that is good. And

637
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:51,600
it was the fifth day of the golden planet. And God saw that men were destroying their arms,

638
01:04:51,600 --> 01:04:56,560
bombs, missiles, warships, and warplanes, dismantling their bases and disbanding their armies,

639
01:04:56,560 --> 01:05:01,600
keeping only policemen of peace to protect the good from the bad and the normal from the mad.

640
01:05:01,600 --> 01:05:09,840
And God said, that is good. And it was the sixth day of the planet of reason. And God saw humans

641
01:05:09,840 --> 01:05:19,760
restore God. And God saw humans restore God and the human person as the Alpha and Omega. And God

642
01:05:19,760 --> 01:05:27,280
saw humans restore God and the human person as the Alpha and Omega, reducing institutions, beliefs,

643
01:05:27,280 --> 01:05:33,440
politics, governments, and all manmade entities to mere servants of God and the people. And he saw

644
01:05:33,440 --> 01:05:38,560
them adopt as their supreme law. You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, all your

645
01:05:38,560 --> 01:05:43,040
soul, all your mind, and all your strength. You shall love your neighbor as yourself. There is

646
01:05:43,040 --> 01:05:48,880
no greater commandment than these. And God said, that is good. And it was the seventh day of the

647
01:05:48,880 --> 01:05:56,160
planet of God. I let the book rest on my lap and looked around me at the magnificent divine nature

648
01:05:56,160 --> 01:06:05,440
of the sacred Mount Ressur and addressed these words of thanks to God. Thank you, dear Lord,

649
01:06:05,520 --> 01:06:12,960
for having fulfilled my dream. And I seized my harmonica and played on it the ode to joy of

650
01:06:12,960 --> 01:06:18,240
Beethoven. So it turns out this harmonica thing, that's the end of the page, this harmonica thing

651
01:06:18,240 --> 01:06:23,280
actually happened. I kind of meant to play it for you. Maybe we can work this thing in. I'm not 100

652
01:06:23,280 --> 01:06:27,760
percent sure. Maybe I'll work in the sound so you can actually hear that it wasn't Robert Mueller,

653
01:06:27,760 --> 01:06:34,240
but somebody else played the harmonica in the United Nations and played ode to joy. And what

654
01:06:34,240 --> 01:06:40,800
that means is they knew that this was happening. So hopefully we'll cut this in. Dear colleagues,

655
01:06:40,800 --> 01:06:47,840
these are our last decisions in this mandate. And I would like to thank you for five years of unity

656
01:06:47,840 --> 01:06:55,920
in diversity. It is our responsibility to keep Europe together and let rebuild Notre Dame and

657
01:06:55,920 --> 01:07:09,600
Happy Easter.

658
01:07:26,080 --> 01:07:37,520
But that's certainly something, isn't it? Something very heretical.

659
01:07:38,560 --> 01:07:43,680
So how is it all supposed to work? Let's go back to his ideas. So now we know what they're up to,

660
01:07:43,680 --> 01:07:48,480
a new genesis, a new recreated world, a new recreation of life, where God works on all

661
01:07:48,480 --> 01:07:54,480
seven days, by the way, and in which the United Nations is a tall house of glass that is where

662
01:07:54,480 --> 01:08:00,720
God says that it all comes from. Isn't that great? So evil. And how is it supposed to work? Well,

663
01:08:00,720 --> 01:08:08,880
let's listen. Idea 1382 from the 23rd of April, 1998. Like the capitalists and communists did

664
01:08:08,880 --> 01:08:14,400
at the end of the last century, we should think hard and conceive how we can make the next century

665
01:08:14,400 --> 01:08:20,800
a paradise, since both communism and capitalism have failed. And since we live in planetary

666
01:08:20,800 --> 01:08:26,240
conditions very different from those at the end of the last century, we must think afresh all of

667
01:08:26,240 --> 01:08:32,960
our current beliefs, doings, and institutions, and formulate an entirely new ideology or dreamology

668
01:08:33,680 --> 01:08:39,840
for an unprecedented future in all human history. Heads of governments, of corporations,

669
01:08:39,840 --> 01:08:46,000
and of all human institutions should be excited by this new, wonderful challenge. And what should

670
01:08:46,240 --> 01:08:54,480
challenge solve? Idea 1343, 15 March, 1998. Humanity has achieved so much progress,

671
01:08:54,480 --> 01:09:00,000
has solved so many problems, avoided so many dangers, and yet now we face the most colossal

672
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:06,080
problem in the entire human history and evolution, namely that industry, technology, commerce,

673
01:09:06,080 --> 01:09:12,720
transport, overpopulation, and overconsumption might destroy the very essence and future of the

674
01:09:12,720 --> 01:09:21,600
earth, including our own, namely, its nature. We need innumerable great and small ideas and

675
01:09:21,600 --> 01:09:27,200
efforts to countervail that. But there's a huge problem in this idea, and that huge problem is

676
01:09:27,200 --> 01:09:37,200
called the United States of America. Idea 1338, 10 March, 1998. From an evolutionary point of view,

677
01:09:37,200 --> 01:09:43,200
the attacks of the United States against the United Nations and reduction of its roles and means,

678
01:09:43,200 --> 01:09:48,480
in other words, we were pushing away from the UN and defunding it, will be considered some day

679
01:09:48,480 --> 01:09:56,160
as one of the greatest errors and lacks of vision in world history. It seems that power went so much

680
01:09:56,160 --> 01:10:01,920
to the head of the United States that it lost its sense of proportions and direction. Therefore,

681
01:10:01,920 --> 01:10:08,240
the United States will decline as a power, as did all past powers which did not adapt to new

682
01:10:08,240 --> 01:10:14,160
fundamental trends of evolution. This happens regrettably on the eve of a new century and millennium

683
01:10:14,160 --> 01:10:19,120
when all countries, especially the best informed ones, should have the clearest possible mind,

684
01:10:19,120 --> 01:10:25,440
views, and heart toward a future written in the stars. We must deeply mourn the fact that the

685
01:10:25,440 --> 01:10:31,040
United States has lost its consciousness of the world's future and of its guiding role in it.

686
01:10:31,600 --> 01:10:37,680
So what's wrong with the United States? It's powerful enough to be sovereign and to reject

687
01:10:37,680 --> 01:10:43,280
this theosophy in favor of individual rights and liberties instead of a crackpot world cult.

688
01:10:45,200 --> 01:10:50,720
What's happened since? Much of what has transpired in the 20th century, especially since about

689
01:10:50,720 --> 01:10:57,760
2015, has been actually all the way through, starting in 2001, September 11th. 2001, much

690
01:10:57,760 --> 01:11:02,800
of what has transpired in the 21st century, has been a direct attack on the United States for

691
01:11:02,800 --> 01:11:09,440
this rejection of the United Nations theosophical ambitions, exactly like Robert Mueller said would

692
01:11:09,440 --> 01:11:17,440
have to be the case. The United States will have to decline as a power because it's not in line with

693
01:11:17,440 --> 01:11:22,880
their evolutionary agendas. The United States had its run but it's not going along with the

694
01:11:22,880 --> 01:11:30,320
program sufficiently so they're going to have to let it fall. That seems to be very in line with

695
01:11:30,320 --> 01:11:35,280
their program. So the United States should have absolutely nothing to do with this organization.

696
01:11:35,280 --> 01:11:40,640
It should renew its attacks, it should renew its distance, and it should completely defund

697
01:11:40,640 --> 01:11:46,400
this evil organization. So then there's another big section based on another block of 100,

698
01:11:47,040 --> 01:11:53,360
based on ideas 1401 through 1500, and it's even crazier than this new genesis idea that really

699
01:11:53,360 --> 01:11:58,320
sets the stage for what they want. It calls for a global association of scientists and thinkers

700
01:11:58,320 --> 01:12:06,320
concerned with long-range evolution. Now this is an excerpt added in by Erica Erdman in her interim

701
01:12:06,320 --> 01:12:12,720
report published in November of 1997, and it starts off with a quote from so-called quote

702
01:12:12,720 --> 01:12:18,480
Space Scientist. Eric Chison, I don't think I said his last name right but you whatever.

703
01:12:19,520 --> 01:12:24,720
The quote says implicit within our cosmic evolutionary paradigm is a transcendence of

704
01:12:24,720 --> 01:12:30,320
the Darwinian principle of natural selection, a loftier standard that I call the principle

705
01:12:30,320 --> 01:12:35,760
of cosmic selection. Those technological civilizations of any type on any planet that

706
01:12:35,760 --> 01:12:42,240
recognize the need for development time and fully embrace a global ethics will survive in those

707
01:12:42,240 --> 01:12:46,480
that do not will not. Okay, so let's be real clear about something here.

708
01:12:47,360 --> 01:12:51,920
So my Christian buddies, I need you to listen. When Darwin talked about evolution,

709
01:12:51,920 --> 01:12:56,480
these people reject that. That is not what they're talking about. They are in fact, remember he said

710
01:12:56,480 --> 01:13:00,800
they were going to reject survival of the fittest. We're going to reject competition. That's what

711
01:13:00,800 --> 01:13:05,760
Darwin's ideas were based off of. That is not what they're advocating. They are not advocating for

712
01:13:05,760 --> 01:13:12,880
Darwinism. They're advocating for directed cosmic evolution. And the claim is that cosmic selection

713
01:13:12,880 --> 01:13:20,320
is the only planetary civilizations that survive are ones that adopt global ethics. What does that

714
01:13:20,320 --> 01:13:27,840
mean? And fully adopt, not just adopt, not just adopt it, but fully embrace global ethics. That

715
01:13:27,840 --> 01:13:33,360
means global cooperation. That means something like the vision of communism. That means the

716
01:13:33,360 --> 01:13:38,880
theosophical endpoint where we are all one. So if you don't adopt their theosophical occult views

717
01:13:38,880 --> 01:13:43,920
of what humanity is supposed to be, they believe that there's a pressure that all such civilizations

718
01:13:43,920 --> 01:13:52,240
will eventually go extinct and will not survive in the grand scheme of cosmic selection, which by

719
01:13:52,240 --> 01:14:01,360
the way is not real. That is not a theory by which anything is said to say, speciate or differentiate

720
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:08,320
persist through time. But that's where it begins. So then we go back to Erica here and she comments

721
01:14:08,320 --> 01:14:15,120
and says his insight into global problems and his vast perspective led Dr. Robert Muller,

722
01:14:15,120 --> 01:14:21,040
Chancellor Emeritus of the University for Peace in Costa Rica and former Assistant Secretary General

723
01:14:21,040 --> 01:14:26,080
of the United Nations to call for a UNESCO backed summit meeting of the world's scientists and

724
01:14:26,080 --> 01:14:31,680
thinkers concerned with the long term fate of our earth and of humanity, which is endangered by

725
01:14:31,680 --> 01:14:37,840
blind pursuit of short term goals. He envisions an exchange of knowledge and ideas among the most

726
01:14:37,840 --> 01:14:44,960
conscientious person on the planet, leading to advances in human wisdom that could not otherwise

727
01:14:44,960 --> 01:14:51,280
occur. And that would initiate a permanent shift toward a more future oriented responsible attitude

728
01:14:51,920 --> 01:14:56,240
worldwide. So this global ethic

729
01:14:58,320 --> 01:15:04,480
supposed to be backed by these ideas that replace blind pursuit of short term goals.

730
01:15:05,040 --> 01:15:13,360
Again, ESG came in in 2003 to start pushing us in that direction from where? United Nations.

731
01:15:13,360 --> 01:15:20,160
Comprehensive sexuality education to, I guess, adopt a new global ethic was developed at UNESCO

732
01:15:20,160 --> 01:15:24,400
in 2003. All straight downstream from these ideas.

733
01:15:26,320 --> 01:15:32,160
So the objective, they state, the importance and urgency of the project lies in the need for a

734
01:15:32,160 --> 01:15:38,560
transformation of past inspired ethics with their many contradictions. Fundamentalist shackles

735
01:15:38,560 --> 01:15:44,960
and mutual hatreds to a future oriented ethic in which all of humanity can unite in a striving

736
01:15:45,920 --> 01:15:51,040
to become more enlightened and more humane. Apparently, we got to take down the US first.

737
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:57,440
Many scientists believe that the universe is dominated by a quote cosmic principle of self

738
01:15:57,440 --> 01:16:03,280
destruction, a universal law that destroys any civilization in the universe, which has achieved

739
01:16:03,280 --> 01:16:08,720
a level of intelligence and technical capacity similar to our own. I don't know who these many

740
01:16:08,720 --> 01:16:14,400
scientists are, because intelligence is not the result of the fiercest competition during the

741
01:16:14,400 --> 01:16:19,600
process of evolution, they argue, our brains cannot possibly conceive of an alternative

742
01:16:19,600 --> 01:16:25,920
that would avert our fate. Other scientists see in the process of evolution a forward march,

743
01:16:25,920 --> 01:16:31,360
not toward more destructive competition, but toward more foresight, insight, wisdom, and love.

744
01:16:32,080 --> 01:16:36,400
These persons, most of whom are inspired by the teachings of Teilhard de Chardin,

745
01:16:36,400 --> 01:16:38,800
who I mentioned earlier is one of the hermeticists,

746
01:16:39,360 --> 01:16:45,280
believe that the trend from the material to the spiritual, from the amoeba to man,

747
01:16:45,280 --> 01:16:48,240
I told you there's this other video and then they mentioned it here,

748
01:16:48,240 --> 01:16:53,040
will inevitably be continued toward superior heights of love and wisdom. Now this was written

749
01:16:53,040 --> 01:17:00,160
in 1997, the amoeba to man thing video that I mentioned was much later, it's much more recent,

750
01:17:00,160 --> 01:17:05,600
so they've been thinking this for a long time, but this trend from the material to spiritual,

751
01:17:05,600 --> 01:17:10,800
from the amoeba to man, will inevitably be continued toward superior heights of love and

752
01:17:10,800 --> 01:17:16,800
wisdom, however threatening present developments on earth may appear to us now. Skipping down a bit,

753
01:17:17,360 --> 01:17:22,800
an association of scientists concerned with long range evolution would help to sort these

754
01:17:22,800 --> 01:17:28,560
contradictions out, and to align and attract thinkers and scientists toward a superior goal.

755
01:17:28,560 --> 01:17:33,680
It is urgently needed to show the pessimists that alternatives to competition until death

756
01:17:34,160 --> 01:17:40,560
do exist, even in non-human nature but especially in human nature. To show the optimists that

757
01:17:40,560 --> 01:17:46,800
reliance on non-human determination of our fate might weaken our sense of personal responsibility

758
01:17:46,800 --> 01:17:52,800
for our descendants and our earth, and to impress upon the majority the importance of a long range

759
01:17:52,800 --> 01:17:59,200
and encompassing vision to guide our choices. Hello ESG. And then they put in bold, a whole

760
01:17:59,200 --> 01:18:05,680
paragraph in bold, what unites us is a look at the miracle of evolution from a cosmic perspective,

761
01:18:06,640 --> 01:18:13,440
a non-stick perspective guys. It is the effort to prevent our species from becoming another dead

762
01:18:13,440 --> 01:18:20,240
end bypassed by ongoing development of life. It is a search for principles and values guiding

763
01:18:20,240 --> 01:18:29,120
humanity toward further ascent. So we got to spiritually evolve the entire species. And what

764
01:18:29,120 --> 01:18:33,680
in the world is this based on? Where did they get these crazy ideas about oh no everything's

765
01:18:33,680 --> 01:18:38,720
going to be bad, we're going to destroy ourselves, every civilization of our kind at our level of

766
01:18:38,720 --> 01:18:43,680
advancement or whatever destroys itself. And I mean on a planetary sense, I don't mean like the

767
01:18:43,680 --> 01:18:49,760
fall of Rome, I mean like everybody goes extinct, the whole thing falls apart. So what is this all

768
01:18:49,760 --> 01:18:55,440
based on? Aside from some weird book that they do mention of questionable worth about cosmic

769
01:18:55,440 --> 01:19:00,080
evolution and some quote from a space scientist. The book about cosmic evolution by the way,

770
01:19:00,080 --> 01:19:05,840
is taken to be the impetus for what I just read. But it turns out that underneath all this are the

771
01:19:06,400 --> 01:19:11,120
neo-malthusian ideas of the club of Rome and the limits to growth. You remember when I talked

772
01:19:11,120 --> 01:19:16,880
about the limits to growth? Now these guys thought that the world was going to outstrip,

773
01:19:16,880 --> 01:19:20,320
the humans were going to outstrip the world's resources and we would all have a population

774
01:19:20,320 --> 01:19:25,600
collapse. And the whole degrowth premise, the whole depopulation premise that we have to

775
01:19:25,600 --> 01:19:30,560
keep putting on the table is all because they believe what was written in the club of Rome in

776
01:19:30,560 --> 01:19:37,440
1971 or two in the book that they published limits to growth, which turned out to make

777
01:19:37,440 --> 01:19:41,680
lots of predictions for the year 2000 that we're all wrong. Turns out that's their inspiration.

778
01:19:41,680 --> 01:19:46,560
Here's what they write. Professor D.H. Meadows from the United States is a System Analyst

779
01:19:46,560 --> 01:19:53,200
and Journalist. Professor of Systems Management D.L. Meadows from the U.S. is Director of the

780
01:19:53,200 --> 01:19:58,560
Institute for Policy and Social Science Research and Professor J. Randers is a Policy Analyst

781
01:19:58,560 --> 01:20:03,440
and President Emeritus of the Norwegian School of Management, Chairman of the Norwegian Bank of

782
01:20:03,440 --> 01:20:08,800
Industry, Norwegian Institute for Market Research and Deputy Director General of the World Wildlife

783
01:20:08,800 --> 01:20:12,640
Fund, which by the way is, if you didn't know that the World Wildlife Fund is really part of this

784
01:20:12,640 --> 01:20:18,640
whole global agenda big time, well it is. And here's why. In fact, it was probably created as such.

785
01:20:18,640 --> 01:20:23,360
I don't know for sure. All three authors collaborated on the pathbreaking book,

786
01:20:23,360 --> 01:20:29,120
The Limits to Growth, published 20 years ago. Their present book, Beyond the Limits from 1992,

787
01:20:30,240 --> 01:20:35,280
also provides such clear convincing and well documented information about our present world

788
01:20:35,280 --> 01:20:40,880
and the dangers of rapid uncontrolled growth that it is difficult to imagine how it could fail to

789
01:20:40,880 --> 01:20:47,360
have an immense impact. Growth is defined as material resource consuming advance only,

790
01:20:47,360 --> 01:20:53,680
while all other growth is called development. The authors however see no indication that people

791
01:20:53,680 --> 01:20:59,440
are reasonable enough to reverse their lifestyles in time. Once overshoot becomes evident,

792
01:20:59,440 --> 01:21:04,720
moreover in most cases it will be too late once depletion is clearly visible. So these people

793
01:21:04,720 --> 01:21:09,680
are going to save the world from itself in line with the Limits to Growth Club of Rome stuff.

794
01:21:09,680 --> 01:21:14,640
And remember the World Economic Forum guys, Klaus Schwab in particular, invited these exact same

795
01:21:14,640 --> 01:21:21,760
people from the Club of Rome to speak at the World Economic Forum in its second year of existing

796
01:21:21,760 --> 01:21:28,560
way back in the 1970s. So this is this is the idea behind almost all of this. So almost all

797
01:21:28,640 --> 01:21:33,280
crackpot faiths and real faiths both present two alternatives, heaven and hell.

798
01:21:34,320 --> 01:21:39,200
We know what that looks like in Christianity, for example. What we can also see what it looks like

799
01:21:40,320 --> 01:21:44,160
from Herbert Marcuse. He says that we're either going to have communism or liberation,

800
01:21:44,160 --> 01:21:47,840
I should say, or we're going to have fascism. So we have heaven or hell. Those are our two choices.

801
01:21:47,840 --> 01:21:55,440
And here the evolutionary new thought, Gnostic new thought of the United Nations,

802
01:21:55,440 --> 01:22:00,240
which is rooted down in this idea of sustainability and inclusion, presents us heaven and hell.

803
01:22:00,240 --> 01:22:07,680
We're either going to degrow to a utopian circular economy intentionally and intelligently under

804
01:22:07,680 --> 01:22:13,280
their global management with their new global faith heaven. Or what we're going to do is we're

805
01:22:13,280 --> 01:22:17,680
going to collapse our world. We're going to have massive over massive depletion that becomes a

806
01:22:17,680 --> 01:22:24,080
downwards vicious circle that destroys the capacity for life on the planet. And then we all die.

807
01:22:24,080 --> 01:22:30,160
So it's the same, same, same structure. So that's this crazy setup. But let's skip down a little

808
01:22:30,160 --> 01:22:37,040
further. Read idea 1433, which he wrote the 13th of June 1998. He says we urgently need as we enter

809
01:22:37,040 --> 01:22:42,640
a new century and millennium, a world conference to appraise the present state of evolution on this

810
01:22:42,640 --> 01:22:49,040
planet and to provide worldviews on future evolution in the next century and millennium.

811
01:22:49,040 --> 01:22:56,640
After humanism, after the environment, after the earth, now future evolution has become priority

812
01:22:56,640 --> 01:23:06,640
number one. Idea 1499, 18 August 1998. After communism and capitalism, frugalism, which is

813
01:23:06,640 --> 01:23:12,960
degrowth, they just didn't have the word to use in 98. After communism and capitalism,

814
01:23:12,960 --> 01:23:18,560
frugalism might become the new ideology and rule of our behavior on earth, demanding from us

815
01:23:18,560 --> 01:23:25,120
more frugal and simple lives in order not to destroy life giving nature. A new economic system

816
01:23:25,120 --> 01:23:31,840
must be born, which will not produce colossal waste on necessary products built in rapid

817
01:23:31,840 --> 01:23:39,920
obsolescence and colossal duplications between 185 nations. That's exactly the argument of Herbert

818
01:23:39,920 --> 01:23:46,960
Marcuse and one dimensional man. Frugalism and simplicity of life might become the salvation

819
01:23:46,960 --> 01:23:53,040
of the earth and future generations. It's also the argument of the degrowth capitalism or degrowth

820
01:23:53,040 --> 01:23:57,600
communism book, I'm sorry, Marcuse and the Anthropocene that I covered in another episode of the

821
01:23:57,600 --> 01:24:02,400
podcast. This is their agenda. This is how they think. So degrowth is going to be the way to save

822
01:24:02,400 --> 01:24:12,800
the world. Idea 1510, 29th August 1998. We must deeply rethink our world's and humanity's future.

823
01:24:12,800 --> 01:24:19,040
It would be good to remember the fathers of the U.S. Constitution. How dare you? It would be good

824
01:24:19,040 --> 01:24:23,680
to remember the fathers of the U.S. Constitution who believed that the function of good government

825
01:24:23,680 --> 01:24:28,560
was to, quote, affect the greatest happiness of the greatest number of citizens and to affect

826
01:24:28,560 --> 01:24:36,320
harmony between the public and private interests, end quote. Today they would add, get their motherfucking

827
01:24:36,320 --> 01:24:42,960
names out of your mouth. Today they would add harmony with the earth in a worldwide dimension

828
01:24:42,960 --> 01:24:55,920
to the attaining of happiness. No, they wouldn't. You dickhead. Idea 1557, 15th October 1998. Speaking

829
01:24:55,920 --> 01:25:03,040
of identities, we should accept happily that we have a polyidentity. Our specific individual

830
01:25:03,040 --> 01:25:08,640
identity, a family identity, a local identity, a provincial identity, a national identity,

831
01:25:08,640 --> 01:25:16,560
a continental identity, a world identity, a cosmic identity, and eternal identity. The future earth

832
01:25:16,560 --> 01:25:23,440
and human government of this planet should take all of these diverse identities into account.

833
01:25:24,720 --> 01:25:30,480
It gets much worse in the next section based on ideas 1601 to 1700.

834
01:25:31,360 --> 01:25:38,080
This is where, like, New Genesis was pretty crazy and totally blasphemous. This is where the

835
01:25:38,080 --> 01:25:43,120
idea is actually getting nut job because it's his cosmological vision of the future.

836
01:25:44,720 --> 01:25:48,400
And I'm going to try to just, I have to read a lot of it and I'll try to just kind of slide

837
01:25:48,400 --> 01:25:53,120
through it as quickly as we can. I will try, this is Robert Mueller, I will try to condense

838
01:25:53,120 --> 01:25:59,360
briefly my thoughts on a cosmic vision of humanity's future. First of all, the most important factor

839
01:25:59,360 --> 01:26:05,760
determining our time is that in the entire human evolution on this planet, within the

840
01:26:05,760 --> 01:26:10,720
last couple of centuries and especially during the last 50 years, the human race has been able

841
01:26:10,720 --> 01:26:17,120
to extend its knowledge of this planet and of itself in such incredible ways that a profound

842
01:26:17,120 --> 01:26:24,240
transformation has taken place in evolution. This is the talk of eugenicists, guys. We now

843
01:26:24,240 --> 01:26:30,320
understand the mysteries of life, the mysteries of humans, the mysteries of the planet and the

844
01:26:30,320 --> 01:26:36,080
cosmos and now we can direct it because we understand it. We can take it into our hands,

845
01:26:36,080 --> 01:26:41,600
we can seize the means of production of man. He says, this knowledge has meant incredible

846
01:26:41,600 --> 01:26:47,760
benefits for humanity and I skip his big laundry list of them. The fundamental fact that we know

847
01:26:47,760 --> 01:26:53,840
our planet, that we know humanity, that we know how to analyze and recompose matter has produced

848
01:26:53,840 --> 01:26:59,440
miracles. Of course, we believed that the progress of science and technology was for the benefit of

849
01:26:59,440 --> 01:27:04,240
humanity. In other words, that our reason for being on this planet was to get the best for

850
01:27:04,240 --> 01:27:12,000
ourselves. This is the great humanistic age in which we are now living. But we did not know

851
01:27:12,000 --> 01:27:17,920
that these great advances would also result in a whole series of crises due to our global ignorance.

852
01:27:18,880 --> 01:27:23,040
Who ever thought of saving energy? Who ever thought of the ozoneosphere?

853
01:27:23,040 --> 01:27:28,720
Who ever thought of possible climactic changes? Who ever thought of the long-term genetic dangers

854
01:27:28,720 --> 01:27:34,320
of nuclear radiation and radio waves? I am asking this question today. What are the things we are

855
01:27:34,320 --> 01:27:39,920
doing today which we think are wonderful and in which in 20 years from now we'll have the same or

856
01:27:39,920 --> 01:27:45,280
worse adverse effects as a few examples I mentioned? Who is thinking of this? Who is

857
01:27:45,360 --> 01:27:51,040
heeding the Iroquois precept that we should think of the effects on the seventh generation?

858
01:27:51,040 --> 01:27:56,000
We do not even think of the next generation. There is not a single ministry of the future

859
01:27:56,000 --> 01:28:01,200
on this planet. Yikes. And I will point out that he actually in lots and lots and lots of the ideas

860
01:28:01,200 --> 01:28:05,920
invokes the idea that we need to go back to indigenous, especially American Indian,

861
01:28:06,560 --> 01:28:12,720
knowledges and epistemologies that comes up over and over and over again. I don't actually include

862
01:28:12,800 --> 01:28:17,840
any of them I think except for that mention, but it's not like a throw in here. It's like over

863
01:28:17,840 --> 01:28:23,120
and over and over again. Indigenous knowledges are the only way. Why? Because they are the model

864
01:28:23,120 --> 01:28:28,880
for communism. Remember Marx's model of communism? Communism is a global state where we all act like

865
01:28:28,880 --> 01:28:36,160
a big tribal family. That's why. Now skipping down some of this, so we can get to the crazy stuff,

866
01:28:36,160 --> 01:28:40,800
of late there has been another fundamental change on earth. Until now we thought that

867
01:28:40,800 --> 01:28:45,920
this planet was at our disposal, that it was created for us. Uh-oh Christians, there's your

868
01:28:45,920 --> 01:28:50,720
beliefs. That it was here for us to exploit and develop endlessly. I think the word in the Bible

869
01:28:50,720 --> 01:28:57,680
is subdued. Well, we are now in the middle of another Copernican revolution. We thought at

870
01:28:57,680 --> 01:29:02,480
the time that the sun was turning around the earth until we learned from Copernicus that it was not

871
01:29:02,480 --> 01:29:10,640
true. Now we're learning that perhaps this planet has not been created for humans, but that humans

872
01:29:10,640 --> 01:29:16,640
have been created for the planet. Uh-oh, there's your earth worshipping Gnostic,

873
01:29:18,560 --> 01:29:24,000
Gnostic theosophy. We return to the earth, he says, as our American Indians and the great

874
01:29:24,000 --> 01:29:30,240
religions have all told us. Thus we are temporary living manifestations or incarnations of this

875
01:29:30,240 --> 01:29:36,320
earth. Again, the American Indians tell us we are children of the earth and we must take good care

876
01:29:36,320 --> 01:29:43,520
of our mother and respect her. We are living earth. Each of us is a cell, a perceptive,

877
01:29:43,520 --> 01:29:50,000
nervous, active unit of the earth. We are earth alive and are beginning to be concerned about

878
01:29:50,000 --> 01:29:56,480
the earth. The living consciousness of the earth is beginning to operate through us. All over the

879
01:29:56,480 --> 01:30:04,080
world a kind of earth democracy, a gyrocracy is taking shape. What you're witnessing is the birth

880
01:30:04,080 --> 01:30:12,560
of a new pagan cult, by the way. You, as cosmic and earth cells, are part of a vast biological

881
01:30:12,560 --> 01:30:18,480
and evolutionary phenomenon which is of first importance at this stage, namely humanity as a

882
01:30:18,480 --> 01:30:24,560
whole. The whole human species is becoming the brain, the heart, the soul, the expression, and

883
01:30:24,560 --> 01:30:32,400
the action of the earth. Pause. Let's talk about Karl Marx, right? Remember when he said that the

884
01:30:32,480 --> 01:30:38,320
earth is man's inorganic body and that the point of part of our activity is that as we

885
01:30:38,320 --> 01:30:42,000
rehumanize ourselves, we're going to humanize the world and make the world fit for human

886
01:30:43,520 --> 01:30:48,480
habitation. So we're supposed to turn the earth, we're supposed to basically integrate the earth

887
01:30:48,480 --> 01:30:52,480
into ourselves and ourselves into the earth so that it were one symbiotic thing and that would

888
01:30:52,480 --> 01:30:56,960
of course avoid the metabolic rift the capitalism's going to produce and the whole point of degrowth

889
01:30:56,960 --> 01:31:01,680
which is the whole point of the concepts of the club of Rome that I just talked about and limits

890
01:31:01,680 --> 01:31:08,320
to growth. So the whole human species, as a species being, namely humanity as a whole, the whole

891
01:31:08,320 --> 01:31:13,440
human species, as a species being is becoming the brain, the heart, the soul, the expression,

892
01:31:13,440 --> 01:31:20,160
and the action of the earth. We now have a global brain which determines what can be dangerous

893
01:31:20,160 --> 01:31:26,160
or mortal for this planet. Yeah, and limits to growth, it was shitty computer models that he

894
01:31:26,160 --> 01:31:31,920
literally talks about. It's like the shitty computer models of COVID but go back to like

895
01:31:31,920 --> 01:31:37,040
1971 and imagine how shitty those computer models would be because that's what it literally,

896
01:31:37,040 --> 01:31:40,880
that's their global brain, is shitty computer models. But what that means is AI is a future

897
01:31:40,880 --> 01:31:46,640
global brain and it can determine what can be dangerous or mortal for this planet. The United

898
01:31:46,640 --> 01:31:51,920
Nations, what does he say is a colon here? What is the global brain according to Robert Mueller

899
01:31:51,920 --> 01:31:57,600
writing in 1998? We have a global brain which can which determines what can be dangerous or

900
01:31:57,600 --> 01:32:03,760
mortal for this planet and it is the United Nations and its agencies, the innumerable groups and

901
01:32:03,760 --> 01:32:11,200
networks around the world are part of this brain. We are a world heart. Altruism, which we haven't

902
01:32:11,200 --> 01:32:18,160
covered altruism in Augusta Comte yet but that's another bad philosophy. Altruism, the concern

903
01:32:18,160 --> 01:32:25,120
of people to be of help, the live aid and international programs, etc. All of this is a

904
01:32:25,120 --> 01:32:31,840
manifestation of the fact that on this planet after having evolved from protozoas to metazoas,

905
01:32:31,840 --> 01:32:40,640
we are now becoming what one would call terrazoas. We are living Earth that is beginning to be

906
01:32:40,640 --> 01:32:46,400
conscious of its role in the evolution of this particular planet in the universe. This is our

907
01:32:46,400 --> 01:32:54,720
newly discovered meaning, birth of a cult. It is happening every day and we have to draw the

908
01:32:54,720 --> 01:33:00,000
right conclusions from it. The world is changing very fundamentally in terms of consciousness,

909
01:33:00,000 --> 01:33:06,640
behavior and action. We know that we are a global family living in a global home. This is more or

910
01:33:06,640 --> 01:33:12,720
less where we stand. In other words, we are in the process of becoming a global civilization

911
01:33:12,720 --> 01:33:18,400
and yet this is not all there is more to come. Beyond our global consciousness, we are moving

912
01:33:18,400 --> 01:33:24,080
into a cosmic consciousness. Remember this is a guy that created Common Core just in case you forgot

913
01:33:24,080 --> 01:33:31,120
that. In other words, we learn to see the Earth process not only as a global planetary process

914
01:33:31,120 --> 01:33:37,520
but as a cosmic manifestation and evolution on a given planet in the universe. It is not impossible

915
01:33:37,520 --> 01:33:43,920
that the universe has not been able to produce many live planets like ours. We are at the right

916
01:33:43,920 --> 01:33:49,200
distance from a sun. We have the right mass to retain an atmosphere and water and we are very

917
01:33:49,200 --> 01:33:55,040
lucky that the force that keeps atoms together on this planet is just right. A little stronger

918
01:33:55,040 --> 01:33:59,680
and we would be a condensed ball, a little weaker and we would be dispersed into the universe.

919
01:33:59,680 --> 01:34:02,720
I hate to point out creationists but he's making the same argument you guys do.

920
01:34:02,960 --> 01:34:10,400
Our planet and its life forms are the result of many miracles and unique phenomena. The religions

921
01:34:10,400 --> 01:34:15,520
rightly say that this is a unique planet and that God has a special design for us. Science

922
01:34:15,520 --> 01:34:20,400
is now discovering that too. Mathematicians tell us that the conditions required to give birth to

923
01:34:20,400 --> 01:34:25,520
life on any planet in the universe are one of the most staggering astronomical improbability

924
01:34:25,520 --> 01:34:31,440
figures they can conceive. New cosmologies are being produced by the dozens but I do not think

925
01:34:31,440 --> 01:34:38,000
that anyone is as yet the right one. There are many different views. The physicists, the geneticists,

926
01:34:38,000 --> 01:34:43,440
the chemists, the spiritualists each have a view. Which one of those is not like the others?

927
01:34:44,320 --> 01:34:50,800
The idiots. I mean spiritualists. That's right. The theosophists. When I put your little dig there

928
01:34:50,800 --> 01:34:54,720
a second ago, Christians, this sounds exactly like you guys making your creation arguments.

929
01:34:54,720 --> 01:35:00,160
I told you the fundamental spiritual battle is theology versus that's you versus theosophy.

930
01:35:00,160 --> 01:35:04,560
That's them and they are stepping into the exact same space at the same time as you guys

931
01:35:05,440 --> 01:35:12,400
to try to make these claims and to bring people into their cult rather than keeping them in either

932
01:35:12,400 --> 01:35:19,440
reason or faith. He says, but it shows that there is an active search for a new cosmology,

933
01:35:19,440 --> 01:35:24,160
for a new understanding of what is happening on this planet where there are many life forms and

934
01:35:24,240 --> 01:35:29,840
where one of them namely the human form. Humans, remember we said before protozoan,

935
01:35:29,840 --> 01:35:37,680
metazoan, and terazoan? Okay humans are becoming cosmozoas. The main factor of the further evolution

936
01:35:37,680 --> 01:35:43,280
transformation and possibly destruction of the planet if we do not understand what is going on

937
01:35:43,280 --> 01:35:51,280
and act properly. You're witnessing the birth of a cult religion. This is something he says

938
01:35:51,280 --> 01:35:56,480
absolutely extraordinary because it means that each of us is a cosmic unit. Sounds like

939
01:35:56,480 --> 01:36:01,600
Deepak Chopra, right? He's one of them. That we have the ingredients of the total cosmos

940
01:36:01,600 --> 01:36:05,840
in ourselves. You only know who Deepak Chopra is by the way because they elevated Deepak Chopra

941
01:36:05,840 --> 01:36:09,440
because they needed somebody to go talk about this and have debates and become very famous pushing

942
01:36:09,440 --> 01:36:16,240
these ideas into the public. How many times was he on Oprah? Oh shit, lots. The cosmos is giving

943
01:36:16,240 --> 01:36:24,640
birth to billions of humans as seeds. Uh-oh. The cosmos is giving birth to billions of humans as

944
01:36:24,640 --> 01:36:31,120
seeds. Many seeds fall on stone or on infertile ground or do not understand what their duties are,

945
01:36:31,120 --> 01:36:36,640
but growing numbers of people understand that they have a cosmic function deep in themselves.

946
01:36:36,640 --> 01:36:39,680
See only some people are actually Gnostics and they know that they're going to have to direct

947
01:36:39,680 --> 01:36:45,920
the spiritual evolution of the entire human society or the entire human species and the

948
01:36:45,920 --> 01:36:52,160
planet itself and cosmic evolution. These people are esoteric theosophists. He says,

949
01:36:52,160 --> 01:36:57,040
if you look over history, who are the greatest people? You'll find the Mozart's, the Beethoven's,

950
01:36:57,040 --> 01:37:02,880
the philosophers, the sages, the religious leaders. They were all people of cosmic consciousness. Oh,

951
01:37:02,880 --> 01:37:08,160
all the geniuses were people like my cult. Of course they try to claim all the people in history

952
01:37:08,160 --> 01:37:15,440
like they always do. They were conscious of living in the cosmos in eternity and in the universe at

953
01:37:15,440 --> 01:37:21,280
every moment. Really? Mozart was? Like, fucking really? I don't think so. Isn't this like, you

954
01:37:21,280 --> 01:37:26,240
say this, the sages and the religious leaders? Isn't this like kind of fucking exactly what Elijah

955
01:37:26,240 --> 01:37:33,680
was like? Eh, no. Um, wrong. There's certainly Irenaeus, one of the greats, uh, cast down these

956
01:37:33,680 --> 01:37:39,920
heresies in the first century. He says, this is why we listen to them. Well, because they're in the

957
01:37:39,920 --> 01:37:43,840
cult. You know, they're all like hundreds of years ago before your stupid cult, but they were in the

958
01:37:43,840 --> 01:37:48,000
cult. And this is why we listen to them, because they're part of the cult. They're a vibration,

959
01:37:48,000 --> 01:37:52,960
he doesn't say this, I'm saying this, a vibration of the Prisciotheologia, the universal religion.

960
01:37:53,600 --> 01:37:58,880
This is why we listen to him. He says, when we read, uh, when we read them, when we see their

961
01:37:58,880 --> 01:38:04,160
works, we are deeply moved and elevated. Why? Because they are in tune with the universe and

962
01:38:04,160 --> 01:38:10,720
make us feel that way. This is what the religions are trying to sell us. Quote, be in tune with the

963
01:38:10,720 --> 01:38:15,840
universe. Be in union with God, with eternity. Remember that your temporary lives have a meaning,

964
01:38:15,840 --> 01:38:21,520
a duty to fulfill. End quote. And when we fulfill this duty, the universe recompenses us,

965
01:38:22,080 --> 01:38:28,800
recompenses us with a happiness, and possibly even resurrection. It is not impossible that the

966
01:38:28,800 --> 01:38:34,800
Hindu philosophy might be right. That only those who had worthwhile lives contributing to the good

967
01:38:34,800 --> 01:38:39,600
and the further evolution of this planet will be allowed to live again. And that worthless seeds

968
01:38:39,600 --> 01:38:45,840
will be left aside to wither away. The religions can be very helpful in understanding these new

969
01:38:45,840 --> 01:38:54,880
cosmologies. Let me just pause for a second. Holy shit. Okay. In other words, he says, humanity,

970
01:38:54,880 --> 01:39:01,040
the same way as it has become recently a global family, is also becoming now a cosmic family.

971
01:39:01,600 --> 01:39:08,720
This is the United Nations, gentlemen. We will realize that we are a cosmic species,

972
01:39:08,720 --> 01:39:13,920
which will find its way on this planet only by following the imminent rules of the cosmos.

973
01:39:14,720 --> 01:39:21,040
I'm sure, ladies, that they alone know those rules. And they're going to enforce them through

974
01:39:21,040 --> 01:39:26,720
one government, one global government, through the United Nations. Some call it God. Other is a

975
01:39:26,720 --> 01:39:32,480
cosmic substratum that is in each of us. It has the manifestation of the living universe divided

976
01:39:32,480 --> 01:39:38,320
and distributed over all reality. Well, there's the fundamental hermetic belief. It is possible

977
01:39:38,320 --> 01:39:43,840
that stars are just living and dying cells of one body the same way as we are living and dying

978
01:39:43,840 --> 01:39:53,120
cells of that same body. Let me pause again. Holy shit. This realization is of incredible

979
01:39:53,120 --> 01:39:59,440
momentous importance. It will occupy humanity and give us great hope and challenges. The story

980
01:39:59,440 --> 01:40:04,720
was told to us in simple forms by the religions, but now the scientists have come to the same

981
01:40:04,720 --> 01:40:11,040
conclusion that the universe is one in its endless manifestations. The recent scientific

982
01:40:11,040 --> 01:40:16,800
literature is replete with this finding. So the Gnostics know the secret interpretation of whatever

983
01:40:16,800 --> 01:40:22,400
it is he's talking about, and it's whatever they think. My proposal, he says, is therefore that

984
01:40:22,400 --> 01:40:28,640
we proceed toward the year 2000. Sorry, I left out the word as. My proposal is therefore that as we

985
01:40:28,640 --> 01:40:33,840
proceed toward the year 2000, we should pack this last decade with visions, dreams, ideas,

986
01:40:33,840 --> 01:40:40,880
and actions aimed at preparing the next millennium as the cosmic spiritual millennium of this planet

987
01:40:40,880 --> 01:40:46,960
in order to properly respond to the expectations of the cosmos or God. In order to do this,

988
01:40:46,960 --> 01:40:52,640
I will propose that a number of major conferences or efforts be undertaken which are not yet

989
01:40:52,640 --> 01:41:00,400
considered by the United Nations. Peace, disarmament, population, the environment, economic development,

990
01:41:00,480 --> 01:41:05,920
et cetera, are all subjects being dealt with in the UN. But here is a list of others

991
01:41:06,560 --> 01:41:11,840
which should be taken up in order to prepare adequately the next millennium. So he's about

992
01:41:11,840 --> 01:41:17,280
to give a list of suggestions that the United Nations needs to take up that it's not successfully

993
01:41:17,280 --> 01:41:21,920
taking up even though overpopulation and the environment are already part of the plan.

994
01:41:22,480 --> 01:41:29,040
How many suggestions do you think he makes? How many? It's 17. Of course, it's 17. Of course,

995
01:41:29,360 --> 01:41:36,080
it's 17. First, a major conference should be convened on a new cosmology. We just heard what

996
01:41:36,080 --> 01:41:40,720
that sounds like. One should listen to the physicists, to the biologists, to the other

997
01:41:40,720 --> 01:41:46,640
scientists, and to people who have come up with new cosmologies. That's the weirdo spiritualists,

998
01:41:46,640 --> 01:41:53,360
like them. From their views, one would extract a common denominator, a Priscotheologia. They all

999
01:41:53,360 --> 01:41:58,000
have very important perceptions, but these perceptions vary with the point of view of their

1000
01:41:58,000 --> 01:42:04,320
professions, physical, biological, spiritual, social, political, et cetera. At the end of such a

1001
01:42:04,320 --> 01:42:09,360
conference, we would have a better understanding of what the cosmos is expecting from us in our

1002
01:42:09,360 --> 01:42:18,320
next phase of evolution. Second, I would recommend a major conference on a new philosophy, a global

1003
01:42:18,320 --> 01:42:25,280
philosophy. Philosophy is the way of life. What should be the way of life on this planet in global

1004
01:42:25,280 --> 01:42:31,600
terms in light of our fantastic knowledge? Where are the great sages of our time? Where are the

1005
01:42:31,600 --> 01:42:37,040
positive philosophies who are giving us an explanation of the meaning of life and hope for the future?

1006
01:42:37,040 --> 01:42:40,160
I'll tell you where the great sages are. You're censoring them. That's where they are.

1007
01:42:42,320 --> 01:42:48,560
Third, a new sociology is needed, which will help us understand the meaning and role of all the

1008
01:42:48,560 --> 01:42:54,400
innumerable groups, entities, professions, and institutions we have on this planet. Most of

1009
01:42:54,400 --> 01:42:59,520
them have a contribution to make to the progress and success of our evolution. Many of them do not

1010
01:42:59,520 --> 01:43:05,120
know it and have not even asked the fundamental deeper question of why they exist, why they were

1011
01:43:05,120 --> 01:43:11,280
created, what their ultimate purpose and contribution should be in the total human fabric. Their limited

1012
01:43:11,280 --> 01:43:17,280
aims and behaviors must be geared toward the needs of humanity, of the planet, and to the continued

1013
01:43:17,360 --> 01:43:23,600
success of our cosmic evolution. This is a vast, unexplored, urgent subject.

1014
01:43:25,040 --> 01:43:30,880
Fourth, we need a new anthropology, as Margaret Mead recommended. Remember, that's the mother of

1015
01:43:30,880 --> 01:43:36,480
cultural relativism. We need world celebrations as we have them in the family and religions in

1016
01:43:36,480 --> 01:43:42,240
nations. Humans in the world have to develop common paradigms, common ideals, and benchmarks for

1017
01:43:42,240 --> 01:43:48,560
the future. The science of the total human race leaves much to be desired. We do more research

1018
01:43:48,560 --> 01:43:54,880
on tribal systems than on global humanity, its meaning, evolution, and system. So we need a

1019
01:43:54,880 --> 01:44:00,880
science of humanity, apparently. Fifth, we need an overall human biology. I wonder if it knows

1020
01:44:00,880 --> 01:44:06,560
what a woman is. A science of human life on this planet, we study more animals and microbes than

1021
01:44:06,560 --> 01:44:11,440
we study the functioning of the human species. To the biologists, this is political. It should not

1022
01:44:11,440 --> 01:44:17,360
be so. The biologists should tell us very frankly and honestly how the human species functions,

1023
01:44:17,360 --> 01:44:22,720
from their point of view as experts in life. If they do it for the fishes and the mammals,

1024
01:44:22,720 --> 01:44:27,120
they can and should also do it for the human species. Well, they're biologists, so maybe they

1025
01:44:27,120 --> 01:44:33,760
do know what a woman is, but it doesn't appear to be the case. Sixth, we need a global cosmic

1026
01:44:33,760 --> 01:44:39,440
spirituality. We have heard religious leaders of various faiths. It was illuminating. I hope that

1027
01:44:39,440 --> 01:44:44,480
religious leaders will get together and define before the end of this century the cosmic laws

1028
01:44:44,480 --> 01:44:50,240
which are common to all their faiths. So there's a great ecumenical movement. And imagine if you

1029
01:44:50,240 --> 01:44:57,440
tied that thing through the church to the businesses and called it the center for inclusive capitalism.

1030
01:44:58,960 --> 01:45:03,680
They have been cosmic experts and interpreters of the heavens for a long time. They should tell the

1031
01:45:03,680 --> 01:45:10,160
politicians what the cosmic laws are, what God or the gods or the cosmos are expecting from humans.

1032
01:45:11,200 --> 01:45:16,560
It's good that we had last year the Oxford Conference of Parliamentarians, scientists,

1033
01:45:16,560 --> 01:45:22,000
and religious leaders, and that in January 1990 a second conference will be held in Moscow.

1034
01:45:22,000 --> 01:45:28,480
We must hope also that the Pope will come before the year 2000 to the United Nations, speak for all

1035
01:45:28,480 --> 01:45:33,920
the religions and spiritualists on the planet, and give the world the religious view of how the

1036
01:45:33,920 --> 01:45:38,960
third millennium should be a spiritual millennium, a millennium in which we will see the integration

1037
01:45:38,960 --> 01:45:45,200
and harmony of humanity with creation, with nature, with the planet, with the heavens, and with eternity.

1038
01:45:46,240 --> 01:45:52,080
Yeah, let the intergalists do it. Their system is an intergalistic system, by the way, just pointing

1039
01:45:52,080 --> 01:46:01,280
that out. Seventh, we need a new world policy and political system. Uh-oh. This planet is mismanaged

1040
01:46:01,280 --> 01:46:06,320
to an incredible degree. If the United States were managed like the world is managed, it would be a

1041
01:46:06,320 --> 01:46:12,560
disaster. Nobody would understand how 50 states in the world has 185, each having a president

1042
01:46:12,560 --> 01:46:17,920
to flag an army and absolute sovereignty could ever work together. Imagine the United States

1043
01:46:17,920 --> 01:46:22,960
government in Washington being only a kind of United Nations without any authority, any legislative

1044
01:46:22,960 --> 01:46:26,800
power, barely any resources. You mean kind of like the founding fathers thought it would be?

1045
01:46:26,800 --> 01:46:33,120
It would be a disaster. Well, we have this disaster for the world, and it is about time we recognize

1046
01:46:33,120 --> 01:46:39,760
it. Ken Keyes, I think that's how you say his name. Excellent book Planethood makes this point and

1047
01:46:39,760 --> 01:46:45,520
offers a way for the political reform of this planet. The birth of the European Union, which was

1048
01:46:45,520 --> 01:46:52,240
seen by Jean Monnet and Robert Schumann as the first step toward a world union, is the biggest

1049
01:46:52,240 --> 01:47:01,440
harbinger of hope. How's that going for you now, fuckers? Eighth, we need a proper planetary

1050
01:47:01,440 --> 01:47:06,560
management. Private firms and the multinationals must face up to the responsibilities for the

1051
01:47:06,560 --> 01:47:12,960
management of the planet. Oh, ESG. They consider themselves responsible only to profits and

1052
01:47:13,040 --> 01:47:17,040
stockholders. Well, it's becoming increasingly manifest that this planet was not created for

1053
01:47:17,040 --> 01:47:22,240
the purpose of making money. We urgently need a science, a strategy, and a methodology for

1054
01:47:22,240 --> 01:47:31,200
of proper management of planet Earth. There's ESG right there. And there is these big investment

1055
01:47:31,200 --> 01:47:37,280
firms taking control of all of the private firms and multinationals for the responsibilities for

1056
01:47:37,280 --> 01:47:44,880
the management of the planet. Environmental social and governance. Ninth, we need a new world,

1057
01:47:44,880 --> 01:47:50,160
philanthropy. People are giving their wealth and monies to a hospital, to a local university,

1058
01:47:50,160 --> 01:47:55,920
to a national foundation, or purpose. And the world gets little or nothing. The University for

1059
01:47:55,920 --> 01:48:00,480
Peace here in the demilitarized Costa Rica is one of the most beautiful and useful projects on the

1060
01:48:00,480 --> 01:48:04,720
Earth. But where are the philanthropists who are taking an interest in it with the exception of

1061
01:48:04,720 --> 01:48:11,200
one or two? So he's not getting enough money for his own little stupid project. And yet it is here

1062
01:48:11,200 --> 01:48:15,920
in this university where a new science of peace must be developed for this planet. Maybe we don't

1063
01:48:15,920 --> 01:48:22,080
want that shit, dude. And thousands of peacemakers educated for a whole series of professions. Oh,

1064
01:48:22,080 --> 01:48:27,120
great. More infiltration. The people have to take the financing of the world's care into their own

1065
01:48:27,120 --> 01:48:32,320
hands. In other words, you taking it literally into your own hands and giving your money where you

1066
01:48:32,320 --> 01:48:36,720
want is not adequate. So it's going to have to be channeled to what they want. So philanthropy is

1067
01:48:36,720 --> 01:48:42,640
going to have to be globally coordinated to go to UN designated things. Got you. We do not even have

1068
01:48:42,640 --> 01:48:47,600
an intergovernmental world budget. Well, if governments do not want to have a world budget,

1069
01:48:47,600 --> 01:48:53,280
let the philanthropists and the people do it in their own way. A new world democracy will thus

1070
01:48:53,280 --> 01:49:03,440
be born. 10th, we need a new world education, SDG 4. Global education, namely in the education

1071
01:49:03,440 --> 01:49:07,760
of children and our global home and into the human family is making good progress.

1072
01:49:08,960 --> 01:49:14,320
But we have to go beyond. We need the cosmic education foreseen by the religious and by people

1073
01:49:14,320 --> 01:49:19,520
like Maria Montessori. We need a holistic education teaching the wholism of the universe and the

1074
01:49:19,520 --> 01:49:24,560
planet. I am glad that one of the first graduates of the Robert Mueller School in Arlington, Texas,

1075
01:49:24,560 --> 01:49:30,000
which teaches my world core curriculum will take the floor during this conference to announce the

1076
01:49:30,000 --> 01:49:36,720
creation of a United Nations of Youth. How beautiful. So the guy who created Common Core says we need

1077
01:49:36,720 --> 01:49:41,600
a new world global education. What's he going to focus on? Well, we now know and I'll do a podcast

1078
01:49:41,600 --> 01:49:45,920
on this sooner or later, the UN's idea of global citizenship and global citizenship education.

1079
01:49:46,000 --> 01:49:54,800
11th, we need a new world information. Outer space inspectors would be shocked by the wrong

1080
01:49:54,800 --> 01:49:59,200
information that is being spread around the world. Uh oh, we've got to manage misinformation and

1081
01:49:59,200 --> 01:50:04,000
disinformation. We need honest, objective, truthful information to guide our way and

1082
01:50:04,000 --> 01:50:08,960
behavior and not manipulate information for all kinds of purposes. Iron law of vote projection

1083
01:50:08,960 --> 01:50:14,960
never misses as we've now learned. Proper world information, communications and media are another

1084
01:50:14,960 --> 01:50:21,760
subject of paramount importance. The United Nations and its 32 specialized agencies and world

1085
01:50:21,760 --> 01:50:28,080
programs come closest to that which uh sorry come closest to what such an information system should

1086
01:50:28,080 --> 01:50:36,640
be. 12th, we need a new world ethics. What is good for the United States, Russia or any other country

1087
01:50:36,640 --> 01:50:42,320
like having atomic bombs and there are 40,000 in the world can be awfully bad for our planet.

1088
01:50:42,320 --> 01:50:47,680
I'm sure that God or the cosmos has not created this planet to have all these nuclear detonators

1089
01:50:47,680 --> 01:50:55,520
and its flesh and its water and its air and in the stars. Okay, I just have to stop there for

1090
01:50:55,520 --> 01:51:01,920
a second. We haven't put any fucking nuclear weapons in any stars and stars are literally

1091
01:51:01,920 --> 01:51:08,560
gigantic nuclear explosions of such vast proportions that we can't contemplate them. So

1092
01:51:08,560 --> 01:51:14,400
if God made the stars, he did want nuclear fucking detonations in the stars. This guy is a

1093
01:51:16,160 --> 01:51:22,080
sorry lost my temper. I'm sick of these crackpots. I really don't like these people. Anyway,

1094
01:51:22,080 --> 01:51:29,040
and in the stars and in the stars, what are you adding that for you freaking moron? God.

1095
01:51:30,560 --> 01:51:35,280
Our political leaders must be given to understand that they do not only have a responsibility

1096
01:51:35,280 --> 01:51:40,400
toward their people and toward humanity, but toward the success of the extraordinary cosmic

1097
01:51:40,400 --> 01:51:45,120
process. By the way, dude, the primary energy source of the extraordinary cosmic process is

1098
01:51:45,120 --> 01:51:52,000
nuclear detonations in the stars. Perhaps unique in the whole universe unfolding on this planet,

1099
01:51:52,880 --> 01:51:58,080
they might finish it or they might help and foster it. I know we kind of lost the plot on that one.

1100
01:51:58,080 --> 01:52:02,720
New world ethics. So we've all got to have this new world global ethical system that's

1101
01:52:02,720 --> 01:52:07,520
facilitated through their occult theosophical religion that's focused on a gyrocracy.

1102
01:52:08,160 --> 01:52:13,600
Thirteenth, and we remember that 13 is the magical number of power in their numerology.

1103
01:52:14,400 --> 01:52:19,920
Just like 17 is the magical number of one completed turn of transformation,

1104
01:52:19,920 --> 01:52:26,160
13 is the power to turn that transformative wheel. So what do they say is 13th? What does he say?

1105
01:52:26,160 --> 01:52:31,360
Robert Mueller, we need a new world science and technology. The scientists and the technologists

1106
01:52:31,440 --> 01:52:36,960
must assume a cosmic responsibility. What they are doing might be right or wrong for humanity

1107
01:52:36,960 --> 01:52:42,720
and for a further evolution. They have to think of the seventh generation and should place Orin

1108
01:52:42,720 --> 01:52:47,520
Lyon's prayer on their desk. And I do not know what that refers to, but apparently it's written

1109
01:52:47,520 --> 01:52:55,520
down in idea 899, which is I don't think in this document. Fourteenth, we need a new world economy.

1110
01:52:55,600 --> 01:53:02,560
Oikos nomos means the management of the home. At long last, we recognize that planet earth

1111
01:53:02,560 --> 01:53:09,200
is our home. We need a world economy in which all people have decent cosmic lives and perform

1112
01:53:09,200 --> 01:53:14,000
the functions for which they were born. Sounds exactly like George Soros' idea of an open society

1113
01:53:14,000 --> 01:53:20,160
or Herbert Marcus' idea of a liberated society or Marx's idea of a completed communism. It goes

1114
01:53:20,160 --> 01:53:25,440
far beyond the new international economic order. It is a restructuring of the economy based on

1115
01:53:25,440 --> 01:53:34,720
the ecology, Oikos logos, and the knowledge of our planet. We have to put our house, which is on the

1116
01:53:34,720 --> 01:53:40,720
planet, in good evolutionary order to become a planet of extraordinary beauty, conservation,

1117
01:53:40,720 --> 01:53:46,560
renewal, happiness, and justice for all. So we need an entire new world economy. I bet you it's

1118
01:53:46,560 --> 01:53:54,240
going to work like agenda 30 by 30, where by the year 2030, that's the by 30 part, 30% of the world

1119
01:53:54,240 --> 01:54:00,240
will be uninhabited and back to the wild and not used for any commercial or productive purpose.

1120
01:54:02,480 --> 01:54:08,800
Fifteenth, we need a new world art. See the table framework for the planetary cosmic role of art

1121
01:54:08,800 --> 01:54:13,600
and culture. I love the way they talk. The planetary cosmic role of art.

1122
01:54:16,160 --> 01:54:20,560
We need a renaissance of art similar to the Italian Renaissance, which put things into harmony

1123
01:54:20,560 --> 01:54:26,480
again. Modern art was the expression of our analytical period. We dissected everything.

1124
01:54:26,480 --> 01:54:30,880
We now know it was probably propped up by crackpots who wanted to put ugly crap in front of us to

1125
01:54:30,880 --> 01:54:37,840
demoralize us, frankly. Art has to be paid for. We now have to put everything into harmony again.

1126
01:54:37,840 --> 01:54:43,840
We need a holistic universal art expressing our faith, sense of beauty, happiness, and planetary,

1127
01:54:43,840 --> 01:54:49,520
humanistic cosmic consciousness. As all great poets, writers, painters, musicians, and sculptors

1128
01:54:49,520 --> 01:54:55,520
have done in the past. The classic book by Richard Burke on cosmic consciousness gives us a whole

1129
01:54:55,520 --> 01:55:01,680
list of such people. We also need world anthems like the one we heard this morning. Some of the

1130
01:55:01,680 --> 01:55:07,440
sanguinary violent national anthems need to be rewritten. I think that that one might include

1131
01:55:07,440 --> 01:55:12,560
the national anthem of the United States, the Star Spangled Banner, which is a very interesting

1132
01:55:12,560 --> 01:55:16,560
national anthem because it's actually not about a war. A lot of people think it's about

1133
01:55:16,560 --> 01:55:23,360
happening within a war. The first stanza of the Star Spangled Banner is a question.

1134
01:55:24,880 --> 01:55:32,480
Is our flag still there? Are we still going to make it? We have a long, dangerous, perilous night

1135
01:55:32,480 --> 01:55:39,200
in this war for our independence attacking us to establish this new nation of ideals and human

1136
01:55:39,200 --> 01:55:45,440
liberty, and is it still there? That's the whole point, but I bet you, I bet you that's part of it.

1137
01:55:45,920 --> 01:55:51,200
He says, I have a new text of the Marseilles written by young people, which starts with the words

1138
01:55:52,080 --> 01:55:58,480
Aliens en font de la planète, come children of the planet. Why not? It is beautiful. I hope that

1139
01:55:58,480 --> 01:56:03,040
the young people in Strasbourg will sing it on the occasion of the 200th anniversary of the French

1140
01:56:03,040 --> 01:56:09,040
Revolution. Several national anthems have similarly been rewritten by young people. I have a whole

1141
01:56:09,040 --> 01:56:18,480
file of them. That's great. No. 16th, we need a new world psychology. Does it know what a woman is?

1142
01:56:19,120 --> 01:56:24,320
We must learn how to love our wonderful earth and miraculous humanity above anything else.

1143
01:56:24,320 --> 01:56:29,600
Now we're being taught to love a nation or a group or a religion and to kill other human beings,

1144
01:56:29,600 --> 01:56:38,160
other divine beings for them. Well, not really. I mean, some do that, but there is this whole

1145
01:56:38,160 --> 01:56:43,040
just war concept where you get to defend yourself if people attack you or try to steal your stuff.

1146
01:56:43,040 --> 01:56:49,760
I mean, there's a thing. This is contrary to nature and to cosmic divine laws. We have to love

1147
01:56:49,760 --> 01:56:54,640
humanity. We have to love the planet. We have to love the universe and have to be their instruments

1148
01:56:54,640 --> 01:56:59,120
during our short years on this earth. If we do not, life on this planet will come to an end.

1149
01:56:59,680 --> 01:57:04,960
A completely new world psychology must lay down our right sentimental priorities. This is what

1150
01:57:04,960 --> 01:57:14,080
Freud told Einstein, the idea 1020, in their famous exchange of views. 17th. And he starts this way,

1151
01:57:14,080 --> 01:57:19,920
and this is very significant. 17th but not last. Let me tell you real quick. There's no 18. So it

1152
01:57:19,920 --> 01:57:27,600
is 17th but last, but he inserts or insists 17th but not last. Why? Because it's a cycle of evolution.

1153
01:57:27,600 --> 01:57:33,760
17 steps to turn history once. And then there will be 17 more steps to turn history again,

1154
01:57:33,760 --> 01:57:39,440
another revolution. Revolutions in 17 steps. Marx identified 17 contradictions in capitalism.

1155
01:57:40,000 --> 01:57:46,080
Paulo Freire said it takes 17 generative themes to radicalize or conscientize a learner.

1156
01:57:47,040 --> 01:57:52,800
The Corpus Hermeticum has 17 books. I'm not going to get into the spiral of Theodorus and

1157
01:57:52,800 --> 01:57:58,560
where this comes from from the Pythagorean mathematical numbers cult, but that's ultimately

1158
01:57:58,560 --> 01:58:05,200
what it is. 17th but not last. We must teach the children of this planet a new art of living.

1159
01:58:05,760 --> 01:58:11,280
Show them how great life is. How's that going for you guys? How's your comprehensive sexuality

1160
01:58:11,280 --> 01:58:17,040
education working out for their precious little minds? It's killing them. We should teach them

1161
01:58:17,040 --> 01:58:22,480
how thankful they should be to live today at this time of magnificent consciousness and the

1162
01:58:22,480 --> 01:58:27,760
incredible knowledge of the universe, that it will be their role to be the right managers of the

1163
01:58:27,760 --> 01:58:33,440
planet, that each of them is a cosmic unit or as Pablo Casals said, quote, a true miracle,

1164
01:58:33,440 --> 01:58:38,720
a potential Leonardo or Beethoven. Therefore, you cannot hurt, you cannot kill another miracle,

1165
01:58:38,720 --> 01:58:44,800
end quote. How's that working out guys? How's your, how are your things working out for that?

1166
01:58:44,800 --> 01:58:53,360
Seems like you're lying. Yes, we are miracles, microcosms, cosmozoas of the universe. This must

1167
01:58:53,360 --> 01:58:57,360
be taught to children so that they can flower to the responsibility for which they're born. In

1168
01:58:57,360 --> 01:59:01,840
other words, global citizenship education, which is defined literally in terms of teaching them to

1169
01:59:01,840 --> 01:59:08,320
meet the 17 Sustainable Development Goals of the United Nations Agenda 2030. We also have to teach

1170
01:59:08,320 --> 01:59:13,840
frugality, the deep growth, and simple living in order not to destroy or tax unduly the beautiful

1171
01:59:13,840 --> 01:59:20,720
creation of God. We should follow in the footsteps of St. Francis, who preached this 800 years ago.

1172
01:59:20,720 --> 01:59:27,840
We should read Voluntary Simplicity by Dwayne Elgin. Simple frugal lives of five billion people

1173
01:59:27,840 --> 01:59:33,520
are the most monumental contribution to the environment of this planet. Every human being

1174
01:59:33,520 --> 01:59:39,360
should know that he or she is an instrument of God or the universe, be it as a mother who gives

1175
01:59:39,360 --> 01:59:44,880
life to a child, as a new divine being, or as a father who in the family is raising a new cosmic

1176
01:59:44,880 --> 01:59:54,240
unit, or an educator who is educating new cosmogens, or a doctor who will heal cosmic

1177
01:59:54,240 --> 02:00:01,920
patients or public servants or artists, etc. There's 17. Then we will fully validate life and

1178
02:00:01,920 --> 02:00:07,680
make children and people proud to be alive. How's that going for you guys? We gave you guys a 20

1179
02:00:07,680 --> 02:00:13,920
year run on that. How's it going? Is that working? Is that what's happening? Then humans will respect

1180
02:00:13,920 --> 02:00:19,840
their own miraculous divine cosmicity, as Buckminster Fuller said when he was offered cigarettes,

1181
02:00:19,840 --> 02:00:24,160
quote, I will never do anything that might impair the functioning of the perfect cosmic

1182
02:00:24,160 --> 02:00:30,720
unit I have been given by the universe, end quote. This is a language which we should hold to

1183
02:00:30,720 --> 02:00:37,840
children. This would be the real fight against drugs, alcohol, and violent television and literature.

1184
02:00:37,840 --> 02:00:44,640
How's that working out? You do not damage your incredible cosmic entity by introducing

1185
02:00:44,640 --> 02:00:49,600
poisonous materials and images into its functioning. Can we talk about books like Gender Queer?

1186
02:00:50,880 --> 02:00:54,640
Which is part of your comprehensive sexuality education stuff. Can we talk about what you're

1187
02:00:54,640 --> 02:01:00,160
actually doing? We can validate life to an unprecedented degree and extend it to the

1188
02:01:00,160 --> 02:01:05,280
largest and smallest manifestations of the universe. This should be the philosophy of the

1189
02:01:05,280 --> 02:01:10,960
next century. I would like to conclude by saying that perhaps we should replace the popular recent

1190
02:01:10,960 --> 02:01:18,560
saying, quote, think globally act locally by think cosmically act locally wherever you live

1191
02:01:18,560 --> 02:01:25,040
on this miraculous planet. Thank you very much for giving me some of your precious cosmic time.

1192
02:01:25,040 --> 02:01:32,080
Doesn't just make you want to punch this guy in the head. Idea 1633. So now we elaborate on this.

1193
02:01:32,960 --> 02:01:40,320
29 December 1998. The word politics should be abolished and replaced by something much deeper.

1194
02:01:40,320 --> 02:01:45,920
I like planetics, the management of our planet. But it's even deeper than that. What is happening

1195
02:01:45,920 --> 02:01:51,360
on our earth is a whole series of fundamental biological evolutionary changes. We need to

1196
02:01:51,360 --> 02:01:56,720
consider the biology and evolution of the earth in its entirety. This should be the only concern

1197
02:01:56,720 --> 02:02:03,200
of government to manage the entire earth. The collective preoccupations of humanity should

1198
02:02:03,200 --> 02:02:09,280
be for the state of the planet and the conditions and future of all life on it. The word politics

1199
02:02:09,280 --> 02:02:14,960
must be abandoned. Politicians should become earth biologists and all faculties of political

1200
02:02:14,960 --> 02:02:22,400
science faculties of earth biology and evolution. You get the idea that the United Nations sucks

1201
02:02:22,400 --> 02:02:31,440
in a big way. Idea 1634. 30 December 1998. Human history proves that there are always

1202
02:02:31,440 --> 02:02:37,520
very great barriers, obstacles to a peaceful just and harmonious world. In the past it was futility.

1203
02:02:38,240 --> 02:02:43,840
Then the kingdoms and the empires. Today it is nationalism and tomorrow it will be the big

1204
02:02:43,840 --> 02:02:49,360
multinational companies. It is a mistake to hope that these barriers will disappear by themselves.

1205
02:02:50,000 --> 02:02:54,480
All human history proves that they have to be dismantled in order to be replaced by something

1206
02:02:54,480 --> 02:03:00,640
else. We have reached that point of modern history where both nationalisms and big multinational

1207
02:03:00,640 --> 02:03:08,720
corporations must be dismantled and replaced by something else. It has to come from an outside

1208
02:03:08,720 --> 02:03:15,040
force, a people's revolution or revolution of the scientists, thinkers, visionaries,

1209
02:03:15,040 --> 02:03:21,920
prophets, globalists, futurologists and synthesizers of this planet. So there you have the global

1210
02:03:21,920 --> 02:03:26,240
agenda. We have to get rid of nationalisms and start thinking in terms of global citizenship.

1211
02:03:26,240 --> 02:03:31,280
And there you have ESG. Big multinational corporations are dismantled. None of them

1212
02:03:31,280 --> 02:03:37,520
can do what they want on their own. They are all owned by one another and act in monopoly trust.

1213
02:03:37,520 --> 02:03:42,320
They are not what they were before. They are dismantled and replaced by something else that

1214
02:03:42,320 --> 02:03:49,440
works in line with ESG and United Nations agendas. Why are so many companies so hell bent to achieve

1215
02:03:49,440 --> 02:03:57,040
their agenda 2030 net zero targets? Because they've been dismantled and replaced by something else.

1216
02:03:57,040 --> 02:04:02,640
It's not multinational corporations even, which are their own set of problems. They are monopoly

1217
02:04:02,640 --> 02:04:11,360
trusts that act in the interest of the United Nations agenda. Idea 1708. Regarding globalization,

1218
02:04:11,360 --> 02:04:17,120
one could take my world core curriculum, C volume one, and envisions the globalization and

1219
02:04:17,120 --> 02:04:23,200
futurization of every segment of it. An individual can globalize himself. Families can globalize

1220
02:04:23,200 --> 02:04:28,880
themselves. States, province, departments, that is, local levels of government could globalize

1221
02:04:28,880 --> 02:04:34,320
themselves by creating world associations for local communities, states, provinces, etc.

1222
02:04:34,880 --> 02:04:39,520
It would be a benefit to them to learn how other subdivisions like theirs are governed,

1223
02:04:39,520 --> 02:04:45,440
legislated, and administered elsewhere in the world. It would be an incredibly rich reciprocal

1224
02:04:45,440 --> 02:04:50,480
experience. So that's the idea of global citizenship, which is to be implemented on every

1225
02:04:50,480 --> 02:04:55,680
single level. It kind of takes the idea of subsidiarity and turns it inside out and on its head.

1226
02:04:57,680 --> 02:05:01,920
Yeah, the local stuff is all going to work, you know, as much authority as possible is going to

1227
02:05:01,920 --> 02:05:06,000
be put into local hands, but they are all going to have to be transformed to only do the big global

1228
02:05:06,000 --> 02:05:12,480
or I guess cosmic agenda that's coordinated through the central coordinating and cooperation

1229
02:05:12,480 --> 02:05:17,520
facilities of the United Nations and its new world religion. So if you get everybody in the

1230
02:05:17,520 --> 02:05:22,080
new world religion, you can tell them that they manage their own affairs as maximally as possible,

1231
02:05:22,080 --> 02:05:26,480
but it's because they all follow the same religion. So that's why it's so important for them to take

1232
02:05:26,480 --> 02:05:34,080
over and transform all the faiths into one corrupt global faith. And that's why this isn't,

1233
02:05:34,080 --> 02:05:39,680
like if you don't understand that this cult theosophy is in fact a cult religion,

1234
02:05:39,680 --> 02:05:44,000
a global cult religion startup, then you're missing the entire point.

1235
02:05:45,040 --> 02:05:51,920
Idea 1745. On the occasion of the year 2000, governments and the diplomatic community should

1236
02:05:51,920 --> 02:05:56,960
pay attention to the proposals for a better United Nations offered by Harold Stassen,

1237
02:05:56,960 --> 02:06:02,560
one of the world's last living members who signed the charter. He sees the United Nations change

1238
02:06:02,560 --> 02:06:06,240
from a place where meetings on political, economic and social issues are held

1239
02:06:06,240 --> 02:06:11,680
into a creative center where ideas on religion and philosophy are exchanged for a better future.

1240
02:06:11,680 --> 02:06:16,880
Among his proposals are a central cabinet of administrators, a universal environmental

1241
02:06:16,880 --> 02:06:25,520
institute, a United Nations legion, an inspection corp, a world panel of mediators, a world

1242
02:06:25,520 --> 02:06:32,960
board of arbitration, a world court of equity, a worldwide conference on religions, and a research

1243
02:06:32,960 --> 02:06:38,320
institute of people and government. His book should be read by every delegate to the United

1244
02:06:38,320 --> 02:06:45,040
Nations, by every head of state before coming to the year 2000 General Assembly, and in all

1245
02:06:45,040 --> 02:06:50,080
political science faculties of universities throughout the world. So yeah, they're kind of

1246
02:06:50,080 --> 02:06:57,040
after like everything. So that's, you've now got a taste of how crazy it is. And those 17 points

1247
02:06:57,040 --> 02:07:03,760
and the whole new genesis were the real big points. This is your United Nations. So I'm going to close

1248
02:07:03,760 --> 02:07:08,960
by reading three more of these ideas, and that's it. But I wanted you to have a sense that the

1249
02:07:08,960 --> 02:07:12,720
United Nations is not what you think it is. The United Nations, what you might think is if you're

1250
02:07:12,720 --> 02:07:16,400
one of my followers, but generally speaking, people don't realize what the United Nations is.

1251
02:07:16,400 --> 02:07:22,080
The United Nations is an organization that is wholly dedicated to global governance under an

1252
02:07:22,080 --> 02:07:28,480
occult, theosophical religion. And if we don't understand what we're dealing with, we're going

1253
02:07:28,480 --> 02:07:34,400
to completely misunderstand what we need to be doing. The United States, it said, needs to decline.

1254
02:07:34,400 --> 02:07:40,800
Why? Because we're not in alignment, or we can be not in alignment with their program. This is why

1255
02:07:40,800 --> 02:07:45,360
they freaked out when Trump took office. Trump actually pulled us back from all of this. He

1256
02:07:45,360 --> 02:07:50,480
removed us from UNESCO. They know that he was going to put America's interests ahead of their

1257
02:07:50,480 --> 02:07:55,760
theosophy, and that was why they have to attack the United States so vigorously. And that's why

1258
02:07:55,760 --> 02:08:01,200
they do attack the United States so vigorously, because the United States, in its fully constituted

1259
02:08:01,200 --> 02:08:06,560
form, and its constitution at its heart, is the biggest threat to this cult religion trying to

1260
02:08:06,560 --> 02:08:11,360
take over the world that there is. But I'll close with, like I said, three more of these ideas,

1261
02:08:12,160 --> 02:08:19,280
so we don't drag this out. Idea number 562, 25 January 1996. Last but not least,

1262
02:08:19,840 --> 02:08:25,040
humanity has reached a point when we must consider our human presence, past, present,

1263
02:08:25,040 --> 02:08:30,240
and future on this particular planet in the universe. We now have a tremendous information,

1264
02:08:30,240 --> 02:08:34,160
sorry, no, that's what it says. Sorry, I didn't read it right. We now have a tremendous information

1265
02:08:34,160 --> 02:08:39,840
on the universe in which we live. In addition to our total consciousness of our earth and its global

1266
02:08:39,840 --> 02:08:46,400
evolution, we are now also acquiring and developing a cosmic consciousness of the universe. This is

1267
02:08:46,400 --> 02:08:53,680
the greatest of all our advances in human history, so their cult is. But the mysteries of infinity

1268
02:08:53,680 --> 02:08:59,200
and eternity still escape us and will remain outside of human and scientific grasp. This has

1269
02:08:59,200 --> 02:09:05,280
the result of bringing together the spirituality or basic faiths of all religions and science.

1270
02:09:05,840 --> 02:09:12,160
Faiths, by the way, is in scare quotes. This has the result of bringing together the spirituality

1271
02:09:12,160 --> 02:09:20,320
or basic, quote, faiths of all religion and science. God, the gods, or the great spirit,

1272
02:09:20,320 --> 02:09:26,880
or spirits, or their emissaries, prophets, and human incarnations like Jesus, gave humanity its

1273
02:09:26,880 --> 02:09:34,480
early stages of a cosmic universal, all-encompassing faith or feeling for the mysteries of the cosmos,

1274
02:09:34,480 --> 02:09:40,560
for the norms of love and for the miracle of life and norms of behavior between all humans

1275
02:09:40,560 --> 02:09:48,000
and with all other species and nature. That's claiming an awful lot. These messages, or quote,

1276
02:09:48,000 --> 02:09:53,040
revelations, should not be neglected. Uh-oh, they probably something should happen to them like

1277
02:09:53,040 --> 02:09:58,800
them being transcended. They contain some of the most, some of the profoundest answers to human

1278
02:09:58,800 --> 02:10:03,680
behavior, fulfillment, and survival. Great was our astonishment in the environmental crisis

1279
02:10:04,320 --> 02:10:09,600
to discover the wisdom and rules of behavior toward nature dictated by the great spirit to

1280
02:10:09,600 --> 02:10:15,840
the indigenous people of this planet. The world's 5,000 religions are filled with incredible wisdom

1281
02:10:15,840 --> 02:10:22,160
regarding human morality, belief in life, environmental adaptation, survival, and future

1282
02:10:22,160 --> 02:10:29,280
evolution. This is strongly coming to the fore at this time as manifested in the following.

1283
02:10:30,400 --> 02:10:33,920
But let me pause before we talk about the following because I want to go back to the

1284
02:10:33,920 --> 02:10:40,880
Jesus part here. Uh, so God, the gods, or the great spirit, or spirits, and their emissaries,

1285
02:10:40,880 --> 02:10:46,800
prophets, and human incarnations like Jesus. So all of these characters, Jesus is just one of many.

1286
02:10:46,800 --> 02:10:53,840
Jesus is just another Buddha who gave humanity at its early stages a cosmic consciousness. So this

1287
02:10:53,840 --> 02:10:59,040
is the rise, you've heard this phrase recently probably if you're too tapped in on social media,

1288
02:10:59,040 --> 02:11:04,320
this is the rise, and this is part of the new thought movement that this is all, all into.

1289
02:11:04,320 --> 02:11:08,960
This is the rise of the idea of the Christ consciousness. And of course the Christ consciousness

1290
02:11:08,960 --> 02:11:13,440
is the awakened cosmic consciousness this guy's talking about. And this Christ consciousness

1291
02:11:13,440 --> 02:11:18,320
was supposed to be embodied by Jesus and many of the other great sages and buddhas of history,

1292
02:11:18,320 --> 02:11:24,720
and also the gurus, or the shamans, or whatever else. But Christ consciousness is a counterfeit.

1293
02:11:24,720 --> 02:11:32,720
It is not at all biblical. It is a heretical, theosophical idea. And it is actually on the

1294
02:11:32,720 --> 02:11:40,080
rise again. And you need to be sensitive to seeing that because the battle at a spiritual level,

1295
02:11:40,160 --> 02:11:47,120
spiritual battle we're engaged in is theology versus theosophy. Jesus didn't stutter. He didn't

1296
02:11:47,120 --> 02:11:53,600
say there's a bunch of us that are like me. He didn't say that. He said he is the way of the

1297
02:11:53,600 --> 02:12:00,960
truth in the life. He said the way is straight and narrow. Many, you know, the path of many is

1298
02:12:00,960 --> 02:12:06,880
the path of destruction. He's very clear about what's going on. He said to, he said to follow

1299
02:12:06,960 --> 02:12:10,560
the law. Which law was he talking about? The law of the universe? No.

1300
02:12:11,840 --> 02:12:17,360
He claims, or the Gospel of John claims that he is the logos itself made flesh. So he is,

1301
02:12:18,080 --> 02:12:22,800
in addition to whatever else on a more profound spiritual level, he is literally the embodiment

1302
02:12:22,800 --> 02:12:31,840
of truth. This is not what's being presented. This is a Gnostic counterfeit of that. So the Gnostic

1303
02:12:31,840 --> 02:12:36,080
New Thought Movement is embodied. If you go listen to, you can listen to people like Deepak Chopra

1304
02:12:36,080 --> 02:12:40,880
and all these guys that are their mouthpieces. Look up the phrase Christ consciousness and see

1305
02:12:40,880 --> 02:12:45,360
what comes up. I haven't done it, but I'm so confident that what you're going to find is crazy

1306
02:12:45,360 --> 02:12:51,200
theosophical stuff that I'm not worried telling you to do it. Okay, so all of this is in our next

1307
02:12:51,200 --> 02:12:55,440
stages of evolution is strongly coming to the fore at this time. He said, has manifested in the

1308
02:12:55,440 --> 02:13:01,760
following. One, the dream and plan of my compatriot Robert Schumann from Alsace-Lorraine

1309
02:13:02,720 --> 02:13:06,880
to see the European Union, which started with a coal and steel community, followed by an

1310
02:13:06,880 --> 02:13:14,560
economic community, followed by a political union, culminate in an all spiritual European Union,

1311
02:13:14,560 --> 02:13:19,840
including the Eastern European countries, especially Holy Mother Russia.

1312
02:13:21,600 --> 02:13:27,680
Let that one sink in. Two, the creation in 85 countries, including as a third party in the

1313
02:13:27,680 --> 02:13:33,360
United States of the Natural Law Party. Based on the premise that the laws of nature should guide

1314
02:13:33,360 --> 02:13:39,600
humans and their political behavior and organization, there is only one step to recognize that natural

1315
02:13:39,600 --> 02:13:44,800
laws are in reality cosmic laws. So they're going to take the concept of natural law, pervert it,

1316
02:13:44,800 --> 02:13:48,880
if they were to get their way with this, and then say that that's a step in their cosmic

1317
02:13:48,880 --> 02:13:52,320
evolution. It's the same Gnostic thing I talked about in the past where they say, yeah, yeah,

1318
02:13:52,320 --> 02:13:57,200
yeah, the thing you've got, that's really wise. And that's also stepped like four out of 10. Come

1319
02:13:57,200 --> 02:14:03,280
with us, I've got the other six. And cosmic, astral, blah, blah, blah, is coming down the

1320
02:14:03,280 --> 02:14:08,400
pike and only they secretly understand it. Three, the San Francisco, and this is the one I really

1321
02:14:08,400 --> 02:14:14,000
wanted to hit, the San Francisco Initiative to Create a United Religions Organization similar

1322
02:14:14,000 --> 02:14:20,000
to the United Nations, also born in that city, where all religions of the world could cooperate,

1323
02:14:20,000 --> 02:14:25,520
define what they have in common, provide their wisdom on human behavior and morality,

1324
02:14:25,520 --> 02:14:31,600
and write relations with nature and the creation of God, which I don't know if that's a pun,

1325
02:14:31,600 --> 02:14:38,560
I assume that it's relations with the creation of God, but maybe they mean the act of creating God.

1326
02:14:39,440 --> 02:14:44,320
In the process, they will hopefully reduce and progressively give up their fundamentalism,

1327
02:14:44,960 --> 02:14:49,120
and in other words, actually believing their real faiths in favor of some theosophy,

1328
02:14:49,840 --> 02:14:54,160
they will hopefully reduce and progressively give up their fundamentalism in favor of a global

1329
02:14:54,160 --> 02:15:00,000
spirituality, the same way as nations in the United Nations have reduced the national fundamentalism

1330
02:15:00,000 --> 02:15:07,840
called sovereignty, and given away their sovereignty to the United Nations to govern their affairs from

1331
02:15:07,840 --> 02:15:15,120
a remote, unaccountable, theosophical cult that we should be getting as far away from

1332
02:15:15,120 --> 02:15:22,480
as humanly possible. He goes on to say, may God help us that a world conference be convened

1333
02:15:22,480 --> 02:15:29,280
on proper earth government through what the world's religions have in common in terms of

1334
02:15:29,280 --> 02:15:34,720
universal global spirituality and worldwide human experience, in other words, a Prisket theologia.

1335
02:15:36,240 --> 02:15:39,360
So that was one idea, 1998.

1336
02:15:41,760 --> 02:15:48,080
20 years ago, I wrote an essay on the need for global education. Today, I would write an essay on

1337
02:15:48,080 --> 02:15:53,600
the need for evolutionary education. Tomorrow, I would write an essay on the need for cosmic

1338
02:15:53,600 --> 02:15:58,400
education. So I want to phrase those things in different words. I'm just going to say the same

1339
02:15:58,400 --> 02:16:06,320
thing. 20 years ago, I wrote an essay on the need to develop common core. Today, I would write an

1340
02:16:06,320 --> 02:16:11,760
essay on the need for a social and emotional learning. And tomorrow, I would write an essay

1341
02:16:11,760 --> 02:16:18,640
on the need for global citizenship education. That's what it's going on. That's who this guy is.

1342
02:16:19,200 --> 02:16:23,920
And we did the first two of those, and we're working on the third. And the United Nations is

1343
02:16:23,920 --> 02:16:29,440
actually behind all three of them. And it's all based in a cult theosophical religion that they're

1344
02:16:29,440 --> 02:16:34,880
using education to bring your children into, even though it's damaging to them, even though they know

1345
02:16:34,880 --> 02:16:40,240
that it causes severe anxiety, depression, and cognitive dissonance, that they can then use

1346
02:16:40,240 --> 02:16:45,520
the social emotional learning techniques, which are effectively brainwashing techniques, to override

1347
02:16:45,520 --> 02:16:52,080
in the kids. I did that whole podcast on that document called SEL for SDGs, social emotional

1348
02:16:52,080 --> 02:16:56,480
learning for the Sustainable Development Goals. So there you go. You can read the Sustainable

1349
02:16:56,480 --> 02:17:00,880
Development Goals as evolutionary education and global citizenship as the next step after we

1350
02:17:00,880 --> 02:17:09,280
achieve that spiritual, which is the common core, and then material, and that sustainability, and

1351
02:17:09,280 --> 02:17:19,200
then, sorry, I did it wrong. Ideal, that's the common core. And then material, that's the sustainable

1352
02:17:19,200 --> 02:17:26,160
development education. And then spiritual would be global consciousness or cosmic consciousness,

1353
02:17:26,160 --> 02:17:31,200
I guess, which is global citizenship education. He goes on to say, after World War II, humanity

1354
02:17:31,200 --> 02:17:36,240
acquired beyond national consciousness, a global consciousness. See, it's about global citizenship

1355
02:17:36,320 --> 02:17:40,640
education. Today, humanity is acquiring an evolutionary consciousness. A consciousness

1356
02:17:40,640 --> 02:17:46,560
is a future. Tomorrow, humanity will acquire a cosmic consciousness. After World War II,

1357
02:17:46,560 --> 02:17:52,960
the United Nations was born as the planet's first global organization. Today, the United Nations is

1358
02:17:52,960 --> 02:17:57,760
becoming the planet's evolutionary organization. So it's not meant to be a facilitator of global

1359
02:17:57,760 --> 02:18:04,320
cooperation. It's meant to direct the evolution of mankind. Tomorrow, he says the United Nations

1360
02:18:04,320 --> 02:18:12,080
will become the planet's first cosmic organization. This is a cult theosophical organization.

1361
02:18:13,040 --> 02:18:18,720
With humanity's transcendence into cosmic consciousness and space and in time,

1362
02:18:18,720 --> 02:18:25,680
the sciences and religions will converge into an all-encompassing, holistic, spiritual age

1363
02:18:25,680 --> 02:18:31,200
dreamt of by our ancestors, prophets, visionary saints, and earthly incarnations of the divine

1364
02:18:31,840 --> 02:18:39,040
cosmic forces over eons of time. In other words, Prescott theologia. Our future, he says, is

1365
02:18:39,040 --> 02:18:45,280
incredibly bright and hopeful if we hasten these processes and think in time of ways to face

1366
02:18:45,280 --> 02:18:52,960
very likely emergencies. Isn't that telling? So the goal is to create a one-world theosophical

1367
02:18:52,960 --> 02:18:56,960
religion that blends all of the faiths, all the sciences, all the philosophies, all of the

1368
02:18:56,960 --> 02:19:04,960
activities into one thing, one all-encompassing, holistic, spiritual age dreamt of by all of the

1369
02:19:04,960 --> 02:19:11,760
cosmic forces over eons of time. Wow. And we will have a bright future if we hasten toward that

1370
02:19:11,760 --> 02:19:15,840
and prepare ourselves to face very likely emergencies, which seems to be what the World

1371
02:19:15,840 --> 02:19:21,840
Economic Forum decided it was going to do. And what the UN subsidiary, the World Health Organization,

1372
02:19:21,840 --> 02:19:30,000
decided to switch its mission from coordinating various things about diseases and medicines

1373
02:19:30,000 --> 02:19:36,320
and things like that to whatever the hell it's doing now trying to claim sovereignty over the

1374
02:19:36,320 --> 02:19:41,360
world, which we just heard that sovereignty was the problem that has to be overcome. National

1375
02:19:41,360 --> 02:19:47,200
sovereignty has to be destroyed. And in similar, he said literally in similar ways to the way that

1376
02:19:47,200 --> 02:19:51,680
we're overcoming national sovereignty to a globalist consciousness, we need to overcome individual

1377
02:19:51,760 --> 02:19:58,800
faiths and fundamentalism to a global theosophical occult religion. And I think last but not least

1378
02:19:58,800 --> 02:20:06,160
idea number 1982. He says in idea 502 in volume two, I listed the three main periods through

1379
02:20:06,160 --> 02:20:13,360
which the United Nations and humanity have gone since 1945. One, humanism, two, the environment,

1380
02:20:13,360 --> 02:20:20,880
and three, the earth as number one. In these last 500 ideas, I mentioned a fourth period,

1381
02:20:20,880 --> 02:20:25,120
our future evolution. That's the really crazy pants part of the document, by the way, that I was

1382
02:20:25,120 --> 02:20:30,560
reading through was a reflection on those. Of course, these are ideas 500-ish and those were

1383
02:20:30,560 --> 02:20:35,920
ideas 1600-ish, so it's not identical. I'm not saying that, but that's what he actually reflects

1384
02:20:35,920 --> 02:20:41,680
there is these three phases. And then the fourth one is our future evolution. So anyway, as he

1385
02:20:41,680 --> 02:20:46,960
continues, it suddenly occurs to me that the United Nations is still structured according to the

1386
02:20:46,960 --> 02:20:52,880
needs and philosophy of the first period, namely humanism, with the objectives of peace, well-being,

1387
02:20:52,880 --> 02:20:59,120
health, labor, food, education, culture, human rights, etc. The structure of the United Nations

1388
02:20:59,120 --> 02:21:05,680
system does not reflect adequately the other three recent and equally fundamental preoccupations

1389
02:21:05,680 --> 02:21:12,800
except the environment. A basic restructuring of the United Nations and its specialized agencies

1390
02:21:12,800 --> 02:21:18,720
must therefore be considered to make it the principal central organization of the earth

1391
02:21:18,720 --> 02:21:24,400
and future evolution. We should create a world air and atmosphere agency, a world water agency,

1392
02:21:24,400 --> 02:21:30,720
a world climate agency, a world ocean agency, a world outer space agency, etc. Within these

1393
02:21:30,720 --> 02:21:36,720
fundamental aspects of the earth, we should consider the place, action, and fulfillment of

1394
02:21:36,720 --> 02:21:42,400
the human species. This reform should become a priority on the agenda of world affairs

1395
02:21:43,600 --> 02:21:49,360
at this beginning of a new century and millennium. And I think that's exactly what they did.

1396
02:21:49,360 --> 02:21:54,480
That's exactly what happened. The United Nations, however bad or whatever it was in its inception

1397
02:21:54,480 --> 02:22:01,600
at the beginning, in the 21st century, in the third millennium, became a monster. And that monster is

1398
02:22:01,600 --> 02:22:07,120
completely imbued with a cult theosophical view of the world and of humanity and of its mission in

1399
02:22:07,120 --> 02:22:12,720
the world. I don't think that disagrees with its founding from the Huxleys, but just to point out

1400
02:22:12,720 --> 02:22:17,600
it was being said at the time that the United Nations was not making this change satisfactorily

1401
02:22:17,600 --> 02:22:23,120
by high level people in the United Nations. But that's what it turned to become. That's what it

1402
02:22:23,120 --> 02:22:29,280
has become. And that's what we're dealing with when we look at the United Nations. It is the

1403
02:22:29,280 --> 02:22:37,760
headquarters of a world theosophical cult. It is not what it appears to be. We should have

1404
02:22:38,480 --> 02:22:43,600
nothing to do with it. So I hope that we can start thinking about this more. I'm going to,

1405
02:22:43,600 --> 02:22:49,840
in the notes for this episode, put a link to all four volumes, not just this particular document,

1406
02:22:49,840 --> 02:22:55,280
but all four volumes of Robert Mueller's ramblings and Robert Mueller's website,

1407
02:22:55,280 --> 02:23:01,280
so that you can go look through the other God knows how many ideas, almost 2,000 ideas yourself.

1408
02:23:01,280 --> 02:23:09,280
I didn't even read a hundred of them. So that you have a real sense of how insanely dangerous

1409
02:23:09,280 --> 02:23:12,800
the United Nations really is. And I just want you to remember who this guy is. He was a very

1410
02:23:12,800 --> 02:23:17,360
high level player in the United Nations. He is the creator of something we're going to be talking

1411
02:23:17,360 --> 02:23:21,760
more about. And I encourage you to listen to Lisa Logan about this, this group called the

1412
02:23:21,760 --> 02:23:26,160
Evolutionary Leaders. These are very important people that you think you don't know about,

1413
02:23:26,160 --> 02:23:30,400
that it's going to sound totally insane when you find out about them. So we'll probably hear

1414
02:23:30,400 --> 02:23:36,240
more about that as we go. But he was also the creator of the Common Core curriculum, in line

1415
02:23:36,240 --> 02:23:43,840
with trying to get exactly these corrupt values pushed into these religious values, pushed into

1416
02:23:43,840 --> 02:23:49,440
education. I don't think Common Core succeeded. I think the primary effect Common Core had in

1417
02:23:49,440 --> 02:23:54,320
practice was to separate the ability for parents to help their children do homework,

1418
02:23:54,320 --> 02:23:58,960
and thus disconnect them so that the children became more reliant on the teachers. And as we've

1419
02:23:58,960 --> 02:24:03,120
moved into social and emotional learning and global citizenship education and education for

1420
02:24:03,120 --> 02:24:09,360
sustainable development, they've been able to take advantage of that broken chain from parent to child

1421
02:24:09,360 --> 02:24:16,000
and take the children in this other direction. In other words, indoctrinating them into this

1422
02:24:16,000 --> 02:24:23,920
theosophical cult of what they consider to be Earth worship for the direction of mankind and

1423
02:24:23,920 --> 02:24:31,600
Earth's future evolution on every possible level. Again, the conclusion is simple. We had it right

1424
02:24:31,600 --> 02:24:36,720
when we made them mad. We should pull away from the United Nations as quickly and thoroughly as

1425
02:24:36,720 --> 02:24:41,360
possible. We should discredit the United Nations. We should reject everything the United Nations

1426
02:24:41,360 --> 02:24:44,640
tries to impose on us at whether it's the local level, the state level,

1427
02:24:44,640 --> 02:24:50,000
ideally eventually at the United States federal level, and we should defund it completely. It is

1428
02:24:50,000 --> 02:24:55,840
time for us to recognize the United Nations as an evil cult, and it is time for us to abolish the

1429
02:24:55,840 --> 02:24:57,280
United Nations.
