0	15160	Hello everybody, this is James Lindsay and you are listening to New Discourses Bullets
15160	21160	where I give you a short summary of one topic from woke Marxism that I think we need to
21160	23840	know in order to be able to defeat it.
23840	29400	Today the episode is actually an open letter to young woke people.
29400	34200	And so my normal listeners, this isn't exactly for you, but you should take it to heart.
34200	35200	You should share it.
35200	36280	You should think about it.
36280	38960	But this is for young woke people.
38960	44400	I think that we should care enough about young woke people and woke people more broadly
44400	46040	to tell them the truth.
46040	51640	I think it's very important in fact to drag woke people out of the false reality they
51640	54400	inhabit and back to the truth.
54400	61680	So I've written an open letter and I'm going to actually read that for this episode.
61680	69040	So dear young woke people, I think you'll find what I have to say to you mostly incomprehensible
69040	72520	here, but you need to hear it.
72520	78680	What you are participating in right now, whether you know it or not, is Western Maoism, like
78680	81440	Mao Zedong from China.
81440	86400	This is what your schools and universities and influencers are miseducating you, in fact
86400	89200	brainwashing you into.
89200	96800	Western Maoism, Maoism with American characteristics, and you need to know about where this goes
96800	100040	because it doesn't go well for you in the end.
100040	102840	If your movement loses, you lose.
102840	105840	If your movement wins, you lose.
105840	110000	In the meantime, you lose yourselves.
110000	116080	You are being molded, and that is the word, you are being molded into the Western equivalent
116080	122160	of Mao Zedong's infamous red guard, which he made use of for just two years before destroying
122160	123160	them.
123160	128240	He explained clearly that different things are needed at different phases of the revolution,
128240	132960	and then when they're not needed anymore, they're gone away with.
132960	138520	He needed a youth rebellion to remove his political enemies and to consolidate his power.
138520	142440	He needed that until he didn't need it anymore.
142440	150440	In 1967, the red guard succeeded at defeating Mao's political rival in the CCP, Liu Xiaoqi.
150440	156640	And within months, Mao declared the movement too far left, too radical, too destabilizing,
156640	160800	and he unleashed his People's Liberation Army to put it down.
160800	162200	Some died.
162200	166440	Most were sent to the countryside to get re-education and labor camps while living in squalor and
166440	168440	primitive conditions.
168440	170640	That was their reward.
170640	173800	Yours will be similar.
173800	179320	To get a little bit historical and philosophical, the whole philosophy behind Woke is based
179320	185200	upon the formulations of GWF Hegel's vision, written down in the early 19th century.
185200	189320	He explained how to move history to its intended end.
189320	195040	You might call this the right side of history, and that's done through conflict.
195040	200800	The recipe is simple, manufacture the conflict, use the conflict, and move history with the
200800	204440	conflict through a kind of social alchemy.
204440	211280	You are the agents of that manufactured conflict, change agents, or historical agents, or historical
211280	213720	agents of change.
213720	220680	What Hegel said about you, though, is this, history uses people and then discards them.
220680	224920	As a movement, Woke believes itself to be the movement of history.
224920	227960	History is using you to move itself.
227960	230720	Once it does, it will discard you.
230720	236040	The conflicts of yesterday aren't relevant today, and they won't be needed tomorrow.
236040	241540	The agents of history today lose their relevance in the instant they succeed, and history moves
241540	246880	on necessarily without you and the conflict you generate.
246880	252400	You know how everything in Woke philosophy is said to be temporal and spatial that is
252400	255120	contingent?
255120	261720	It's all some matter of time and space in some place, or so are you.
261720	266360	That's how this philosophy thinks about everything, including you.
266360	270880	You are a contingency for the Woke Marxist movement.
270880	273880	You have your time until you don't.
273880	278360	When you become useless or a hindrance to the movement of history, you will be discarded
278360	281080	by history.
281080	285520	Every Marxist and Hegelian movement in history has proceeded this way, and this one will
285520	286880	not be different.
286880	289240	I wish you luck with that.
289240	294600	In the past, activists like yourselves were seen as useful political prostitutes, and
294600	299800	after the revolution you were lined up against the wall and shot, or deported to labor reeducation
299800	303760	camps and ground into destruction.
303760	309900	Mao explained all of this in 1957, though if you've read it, you probably can't realize
309900	314620	that it applies to you, because you think you're on the right side of history.
314620	321700	He separated the world into, quote, the people and enemies, and he detailed how each of these
321700	324060	are to be properly dealt with.
324060	330440	The enemies are to be hated, silenced, bullied, even beaten, and destroyed, sometimes killed.
330440	335420	That's mostly your job, though the government will help, just far enough so that it doesn't
335420	337820	look tyrannical.
337820	342900	The people on the other hand are to be handled differently, though to be reeducated, brainwashed,
342900	348740	criticized, struggled, until they hold all and only the right opinions, and never the
348740	353260	wrong ones, which is a process that will take their entire lives.
353260	355740	It's never done.
355740	359840	That's what you've signed up for, thinking yourselves virtuous, thinking you're going
359840	366000	to do better, seeking absolution for your good fortune and your privilege, seeking revenge
366020	371320	for the inequities you perceive in your so-called lived experience.
371320	376140	Everyone in this system is abused, though, and everyone who participates in it becomes
376140	377580	an abuser.
377580	384260	You know it, you live it, you give it, and you receive it constantly.
384260	386700	Abuse.
386700	391300	What you need to understand about the people you've been trained to see as your enemies,
391320	396720	you might call them transphobes, or racists, or fascists, or homophobes, or whatever else,
396720	401160	is that most of these people, you think are those things, are not those things at all.
401160	405800	Yes, there are some out there, but most are not that.
405800	411600	You have been trained to hate, allegedly in the name of stopping hate.
411600	418600	These people are by and large trying to warn you, not trying to uphold oppression against
418600	420080	you.
420080	424540	Now what you need to know about the people in the movement you're supporting, the people
424540	429900	as Mao had it, which includes your friends in the woke movement, is that you are less
429900	432860	than disposable to these people.
432860	435340	Being contingent barely covers it.
435340	440700	The woke movement pretends to care about you, or worse, people who look like you, but it
440700	443260	does not care about you.
443260	449660	It is using you so its sociopathic fringe can gain power over society, using you as
449740	454240	cannon fodder for their unconventional political warfare apparatus.
454240	459160	Instead of living your life, growing, learning, preparing a future, building a family, you're
459160	463640	doing activism for them, and they will discard you.
463640	466960	And I mean it, they will discard you.
466960	468280	Why?
468280	474080	Because you are worse than contingent, you are worse than disposable, once they get power,
474080	477080	you actually become a problem.
477080	483580	You don't just become obsolete as the revolution succeeds, you become a liability to what follows.
483580	489060	You're being trained by this movement right now to be a destabilizer.
489060	492540	That's what all this disrupt and dismantle stuff is about.
492540	497860	You are misled to believe that you're disrupting and dismantling systems of oppression, but
497860	502940	you're merely displacing the existing society for one they will seize control over.
502940	507640	You're disrupting and dismantling the foundations of your own liberty so that tyrants can rule
507640	513000	over not just the people that you have been trained to hate, but over everyone.
513000	519080	They need you to destabilize the existing system, but they do not need anyone to destabilize
519080	522800	the new system they have planned for us.
522800	529400	Their intention is to establish a perfectly stable system with them, and not most of you,
529400	530920	on top of it.
530920	536620	And people trained and brainwashed to be destabilizers will be a problem in such a system.
536620	538700	Mao said that himself.
538700	543560	Like I said, he said the handling of the people is different in the different phases of the
543560	545060	revolution.
545060	551620	First, you encourage and support destabilizers to break down the existing system.
551620	555620	Then when you have power, you crack down on them so that there is total stability under
555620	557260	the new standard.
557260	561640	He called this standard socialist discipline under democratic centralism.
561640	567880	Today, it's called sustainability and inclusion, and it's managed under something called stakeholder
567880	569880	capitalism.
569880	575000	You are an asset to this movement today and will be a liability to it tomorrow.
575000	579440	You will be discarded coldly and if necessary violently.
579440	586120	Not by your perceived enemies, but by the movement you are actually supporting.
586120	593100	Make no mistake, this fate has awaited the change agents of every red revolution in history.
593100	597180	Communist defectors have been trying to tell you for decades, longer than most of you have
597180	598180	been alive.
598180	602540	It's written all over the pages of history of communist and other tyrannical regimes,
602540	604620	if you will just read them.
604620	608140	It will not be different in anything except method this time.
608140	612500	If you, as woke Marxists, win, you surely lose.
612500	617120	Tell but the most sociopathic and sycophantic of you, in which case you have to hollow yourselves
617120	622240	out, sell your souls if you even have one left by then and become a true monster of
622240	623240	history.
623240	629400	If you don't believe me, let me ask you, do you see any identity politics in China today?
629400	630680	Is China woke?
630680	632320	Will it go woke?
632320	633320	No.
633320	634320	They already did that.
634320	637200	And that phase of the revolution is over.
637200	642280	It is viciously suppressed there and they laugh at you here in the West and call you
642280	644020	a bisole.
644020	645420	White left.
645420	649380	They know what you are and how misinformed and misguided you are.
649380	653740	Their operatives attempt to stoke these fires and use you because you are strategically useful
653740	660620	to their anti-American aims, which you have been brainwashed foolishly into sharing.
660620	665140	In China, however, they are openly encouraging patriarchy and masculinity.
665140	666940	They're racially ruthless.
666940	669180	They stamp out homosexuality.
669180	670500	Why?
670500	675480	They did their intersectionality already years ago with their red and black identity groups.
675480	679560	They got what they wanted out of it and now they've discarded it and its change agents
679560	682680	in favor of the power that they were able to seize.
682680	685000	Well that's your future too.
685000	687080	It looks like this.
687080	690960	Look at the screen, scan your face and smile for the government and don't you dare signal
690960	695520	in any way that you think anything that you shouldn't be thinking.
695520	698840	Whatever they decide is the right thing to think.
698840	702780	You've been falsely convinced that you're the protagonists in a vast morality play
702780	707180	called The Ark of History, now that you're bending it toward justice, that you're on
707180	711660	the right side of history, and that feels good, right up until the boot comes crashing
711660	713740	down on your face.
713740	716340	Then they say you'll realize it.
716340	719220	You are bending the Ark of History, of course.
719220	723100	If we can even indulge such a metaphor, but you're bending it straight into the 21st
723100	728820	century gulag, whatever those will look like in our increasingly black mirror society.
728840	732280	You will be thought reformed or you will be discarded.
732280	733800	So what do you want to be?
733800	736680	Do you want to be its guard, Agent Smith?
736680	739740	Would you like to be its corrupt administrator?
739740	741880	Is it worth the sale of your soul?
741880	746480	Some of you might aspire to such a demonic station in your lives, but most of you don't.
746480	751400	You actually want to do the right thing, and you will be subjected to this instead.
751400	755840	Even if you take up this evil ambition, don't you know where it goes?
755840	759180	Constant paranoia, constant fear, constant risk.
759180	764860	The Red Guard was utilized to destroy Mao's political enemies in the CCP.
764860	768780	And what will you do when they change the specifications of the ideology that you're
768780	770740	supposed to support?
770740	773860	Perhaps one day they'll decide that trans rights are now too expensive and disruptive
773860	777700	for a new system that no longer needs that means of social agitation.
777700	779740	What will you do, resist?
779740	781740	Good luck with that, Comrade.
781740	785380	So if you win, you lose.
785380	788640	You have a right to wonder how this happened to you.
788640	793120	Why have your generations been co-opted into this horrible situation?
793120	797200	Your education, your schools, your entertainment, your universities, your peers tried to make
797200	802520	you change agents and global citizens instead of educated adults?
802520	807120	If this system wins, you lose because you know too much and are too big of a problem.
807120	811200	Your only option will be to sell your soul to it, and you have to ask, how much is that
811200	812200	worth to you?
812900	815900	And do you think I'm kidding about that, by the way?
815900	821620	Mao said, not to have correct political opinions is like not having a soul.
821620	823220	That's what's at stake.
823220	827860	Think about that and what this is costing you, whether you participate in it or cower
827860	828860	against it.
828860	830980	Doesn't this ring true, though?
830980	832580	That's what you're sacrificing.
832580	836540	Every time you tell a lie to fit in, you sell part of your soul.
836540	842140	And how many lies have you told to fit in with the critical crowd around you?
842140	846120	This corruption of you and your future is happening all around you, but most importantly
846120	849960	in place of your education, which could otherwise protect you from it.
849960	854560	You're not getting the education you could be, or perhaps aren't getting a real education
854560	855760	at all.
855760	860080	You're not learning to be informed, independent adults who can answer questions about reality
860080	862200	and navigate it successfully.
862200	867520	You're being taught to have to defer at every turn to some kind of bogus expert, even to
867520	871360	answer a question like, what is a woman?
871360	875660	There are, of course, costs to this, and not just the obvious ones for you and your future
875660	876900	on a personal level.
876900	881800	The thing you consider your education itself is simultaneously being degraded in every meaningful
881800	883020	sense of the word.
883020	886300	It is being corrupted at its most essential level.
886300	891100	You are losing your chance to get educated while the thing we call education itself is
891100	894420	corrupting itself into its opposite.
894420	898900	You are becoming less functional for the world ahead of you, so your education is corrupted,
898900	903400	and you're becoming less and less marketable in the future world, whichever system wins,
903400	907480	so the credentialing function education serves is also being corrupted.
907480	913640	How useful are you going to be in the coming system, whichever one wins, if you are completely
913640	919400	uneducated, not just a destabilizer, but useless?
919400	922640	Of course, the perversity of this is that they're not just doing this to you, they've
922640	926440	convinced you to demand it for yourself.
926440	933420	You have to demand it for justice, and so you do.
933420	937460	Whichever system wins, you need to understand that you're getting degrees that are increasingly
937460	942500	being seen as liabilities, not assets in the working world that lies around and ahead of
942500	944180	you.
944180	948700	If that future is not woke, you're a liability to the future because you've been trained
948700	952860	to be a woke destabilizer and learn to focus on social theory instead of gaining a genuine
952860	955580	education and real skills.
955580	959680	If that future is woke, on the other hand, you're a liability to it because you've been
959680	965440	trained to be a destabilizer that the incoming system not only doesn't want but can't abide.
965440	970640	And again, they've convinced you to demand this in place of your genuine education.
970640	973720	It's sick.
973720	979560	You have at most one option, supposing the woke win, and that's to sell out completely,
979560	983320	to have nothing authentic left about yourself.
983320	988540	The only place you will have a future is inside the most corrupt megacorporate sector that
988540	995020	is our new western Soviet, a council of stakeholders that knows the science of right human relations
995020	1000580	and holds the keys to sustainable development in a circular economy.
1000580	1005300	If it supports trans rights and reducing emissions today, you will support those things.
1005300	1009780	If it changes its mind tomorrow for the glory of the new system, so will you, or you will
1009780	1011580	be eliminated.
1011580	1017920	Your only path to success inside the system you advocate for is to become a hollow, soulless
1017920	1023120	functionary, an aphistic megacorporate and or governmental public-private partnership
1023120	1024880	machine.
1024880	1030040	Your only path to success outside of this system is to abandon this activism as soon
1030040	1037840	as possible and start healing yourself psychologically, emotionally, and educationally.
1037840	1043340	Your fate, if the woke system wins, is to be disposed of or hollowed out, and use as
1043340	1048020	a functionary of its changing whims, and this should have little appeal to you.
1048020	1052380	It certainly won't bring about justice or satisfaction, and it won't allow you to be
1052380	1055940	a prosperous individual or an individual at all.
1055940	1060220	Your false prosperity will be available in direct proportion to your inauthenticity and
1060220	1065020	corruptibility, the markers of your true utility to the machine you don't seem to realize
1065040	1067400	you're supporting.
1067400	1070640	There's no you on the other side of this.
1070640	1075840	On the other hand, your fate, if the woke system loses, is a hard life that's made easier
1075840	1082080	only by repenting of these errors and working to correct them, and the sooner the better.
1082080	1086120	Already employers throughout the West increasingly suspect that if you even have a college degree
1086120	1091920	at all, you're probably woke, radically leftist, entitled, unlikely to work hard, likely to
1091940	1097500	create a hostile working environment, underskilled or unskilled, and likely to sue if you're
1097500	1101100	fired even on perfectly solid and reasonable grounds.
1101100	1103700	They have every reason to believe this.
1103700	1108460	That makes you very, very unattractive.
1108460	1111260	If you are woke, they know it's true.
1111260	1115900	You actually are a liability to them, and many of them are only still hiring you today
1115900	1117660	because they have to.
1117660	1121380	To keep their place in the corrupt corporate scoring schemes that control the way business
1121400	1123640	is done now in the West.
1123640	1128960	So you're either unhireable or hireable only as an asset to satisfy the ESG demands of
1128960	1133400	a sprawling corrupt bureaucracy.
1133400	1136240	Isn't that great?
1136240	1137760	And what happens if it gives way?
1137760	1138760	Who are you?
1138760	1143880	And if you help it succeed and participate in it, what are you?
1143880	1146480	So the question is why you?
1146480	1147560	Why not somebody else?
1147560	1148560	Why now?
1148560	1149560	Why you?
1150540	1155580	Because you happen to be at the age you are at the worst time in Western history to be
1155580	1157140	the age you are.
1157140	1159300	That's it.
1159300	1163460	Because many of you come from wealth and status and other resources the system covets and
1163460	1165260	requires to succeed.
1165260	1172220	You see, they're not really against privilege in the woke Marxist movement.
1172220	1174220	They actually really like privilege.
1174220	1179180	They just want to seize it and redistribute it and repurpose it to their ends.
1179180	1180840	You are a resource to them.
1180840	1182320	They need those resources.
1182320	1184240	They need your enthusiasm and your zeal.
1184240	1185760	They need your talent.
1185760	1188960	They need your impressionable minds.
1188960	1193640	They need the future citizens and the future leaders of the world.
1193640	1198520	But you must remember, history uses people and then discards them.
1198520	1204640	So they won't need you for long and they'll only need you for specific purposes.
1204640	1209940	Then you will either be corrected or discarded, unless you choose to come off worse by selling
1209940	1210940	out.
1210940	1216080	So my message to you about the woke Marxist movement is simple.
1216080	1218660	You need to know what you're really involved in.
1218660	1222940	Stop participating, deprogram yourself and your friends and start fighting for the blessings
1222940	1227780	of liberty that allowed you to have the privilege to think this way in the first place.
1227780	1229700	You can and might lose it.
1230240	1235000	You're the first generations in American history to face the loss of liberty.
1235000	1241560	But if you do, if you support the woke movement, you do so by enslaving yourselves.
1241560	1246600	You have been sold a false promise of liberation in place of liberty and you need to realize
1246600	1249620	that you're being scammed.
1249620	1252160	Liberation movements are lies.
1252160	1257400	Mao called his army the same one he dispatched to destroy your counterparts in the Red Guard,
1257400	1262420	the People's Liberation Army, and he called it that for a reason.
1262420	1265060	Liberation is a lie.
1265060	1271060	The oldest recorded cautionary tale in human history is the story of the serpent and Eve
1271060	1276360	in the third chapter of Genesis, and it warns about this specifically.
1276360	1282300	It warns humanity about liberation, and you can understand that message whether you are
1282300	1284820	religious or not.
1284820	1287240	Liberation is a destructive lie.
1287240	1291620	We cannot liberate ourselves from the truth or from reality.
1291620	1296420	If you liberate yourself from a free society, you end up in a tyranny.
1296420	1298520	You need to fight for liberty.
1298520	1303500	You think you are in chains, but your chains have been forged by frauds and are locked
1303500	1306220	only in your heads.
1306220	1307820	You are the future.
1307820	1309940	Your choices matter.
1309940	1310940	Choose better.
