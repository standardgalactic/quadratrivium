1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:23,840
Here everybody, it's James Lindsay, you're listening to the New Discourses podcast and

2
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:26,160
it's time to talk some more about queer theory.

3
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:30,400
I want to make the case, and I suppose there's a bit of billion ways I could do this,

4
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:33,600
I want to make the case that queer theory is the doctrine of a sex-based cult.

5
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:41,360
That's it. In other words, to put it more frankly, or more clearly I suppose, queer theory,

6
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:49,840
which pretends to be an academic discipline, is the doctrine of a religious cult that primarily

7
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:57,680
targets children, and that is based on sex and topics related to sex, and that sex meant in both

8
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:04,560
meanings of the word, both the biological fact and the activity, which is related to the biological

9
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:13,680
fact incidentally, and it has very little to do with gay identity. So those are the main points

10
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:18,160
of contention. Some of you will recognize, if you're readers as well, that what I'm going to do

11
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:27,680
in this episode is actually summarize, or mostly run through and ad-lib off of a essay that I

12
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:34,560
published on New Discourses in February after I gave this as a talk in Pittsburgh at the University

13
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:40,000
of Pittsburgh, which is the one where people dressed as clowns came to protest me. And if you

14
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:45,760
remember that image on the website, you know what I'm talking about. It was an amusing little story.

15
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:52,880
The clowns were outside, I didn't see them, then the clowns came in, I did see them, and there was

16
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:59,920
one clown actually and her friend, and about five minutes into the talk, about the time I'd given

17
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:04,960
like the basic introduction and some serious facts, she started crying, got up and left,

18
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:10,160
and called her mom so loudly that you could hear her kind of blubber into the phone,

19
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:18,160
hey mom, as she walked out, and no further incidents were recorded. But the way I started

20
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:22,720
off was as strongly as possible by saying exactly what I just said. I'm here to talk about queer

21
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:26,960
theory and its major points can be summarized very easily. Queer theory is the doctrine of a

22
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:33,040
religious cult that religious cult is based on sex. That's not the same as saying a sex cult,

23
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:38,560
by the way, that's actually different. It is based on sex in both regards, but it's not necessarily

24
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:46,560
sex as an activity oriented cult. And that sex based religious cult primarily targets children

25
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:51,280
and almost none of it has anything to do with gay people or gay identity. And all of that is

26
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:57,120
actually demonstrable in their literature. The least obvious of these points is that last point

27
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:02,320
that has nothing to do with gay people, and it's a great place to start. And the way I make this

28
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:07,200
case, I could point to an awful lot of their academic literature, drag queen story hour,

29
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:13,280
which I read their academic paper about drag pedagogy in the groomer school series,

30
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:18,720
I think it was groomer schools four. I read that paper talks about how the point of drag queen

31
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:24,800
story hour is not actually for LGBT empathy. It's not even about LGBT identity. It's about awakening

32
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:29,600
a queer potential, queer horizon, living queerly, alternate modes of kinship, blah, blah, blah.

33
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:34,240
In other words, what queer theory is doing is hiding behind the gay identities,

34
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:38,080
and it doesn't even have much to do with them. The gold standard proof in their literature

35
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:46,000
comes from David Halperin, which he's a scholar who is the one who defined queer in queer theory

36
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:52,560
in his book from 1995 called Saint Foucault Toward a Gay Hagiography, which means toward

37
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:58,960
making him into a saint. Now Saint Foucault refers to Michel Foucault. People have heard me say Saint

38
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:04,400
Foucault referencing the book, particularly I did it at Oxford in my debate, and they thought I

39
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:09,280
was making a joke. No, it's literally the title of the friggin book. And you can actually go look

40
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:14,000
at this book and read how horrifying it is. It's impossible actually on anything that you want

41
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:20,960
to publish, you know, FCC guidelines or even the much looser online guidelines to read this book

42
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:27,840
to you, because it's too blatantly inappropriate. I mean, it occasionally talks about topics

43
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:33,520
like I don't even want to say it because I don't want the video to get demonetized.

44
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:40,320
Let's just say that it refers to putting fists in certain orifices very explicitly and refers to

45
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:46,880
it as a liberatory practice, and calls it anal yoga explicitly. I mean, you can get the book

46
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:51,600
and to search the term anal yoga, and you're going to find all of this right there in the book.

47
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:59,520
It's pretty shocking to read like a lot of queer theory, but David Halpern's book is kind of the

48
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:03,920
gold standard for defining the word queer. It's where the word queer was first defined. It's

49
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:10,320
like the first major treatise that lays out queer theory as queer theory and what it's aiming to

50
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:14,960
accomplish. Obviously, given the title, it's building off of the ideas of Michel Foucault,

51
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:22,320
who is this French postmodernist. He's also a pedophile. He was also a BDSM gay man. He

52
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:31,520
bragged about his experiences in bathhouses in San Francisco and elsewhere. There's some

53
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:39,760
very unfortunate stories regarding male children or boys around 11, 12, 13 in Tunisia that have come

54
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:47,280
out at any rate. That's who he's harkening back to, and what he's really pushing back to, he could

55
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:53,360
get into discipline and punish, birth of the clinic, civilization and madness, some of Foucault's

56
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:59,120
kind of groundbreaking, I guess, if you want work in what we would recognize now as critical

57
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:05,520
constructivism. But in this case, it's mostly the history of sexuality and primarily history

58
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:11,840
of sexuality volume one. And Foucault in that book is laying out what is the idea of a homosexual

59
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:16,800
in a very kind of parallel way to what Simone de Beauvoir was doing, laying out the concept of

60
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:24,800
what is a woman in the second sex in 1949. Although, allegedly, Foucault was not copying

61
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:28,960
Beauvoir. I don't know if that's the case or not. I'm not going to get into it. I'm not going to try

62
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:32,880
to parse it out today. What I am going to say, though, is that it's the same idea, is that the

63
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:37,600
homosexual should be defining himself on his own terms, and those terms have to be defiant to the

64
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:44,240
heterosexual, homosexual binary, and the power constructions built around it. And this idea

65
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:50,080
of an oppositionally defiant identity, political identity, against norms and expectations is what

66
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:59,040
Halperin said means queer. And in fact, he says that it means queer, where Foucault says the

67
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:06,880
homosexual, it can only be interpreted to mean queer. I probably have that citation somewhere

68
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:12,880
and could pull it up to read it to you, but I didn't plan to. I don't think I put it in this essay,

69
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:19,520
but it's an eye opener. But I'm going to read some from St. Foucault as it is,

70
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:29,440
just so that you can have a sense that this is not about gay identity. So the first words of

71
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:36,560
this relevant definition appear on page 62. That's the page in this book. You have to read 61 pages

72
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:43,120
of Jesus Christ. Could you just shut you weirdos before you get to the point where he defines

73
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:49,920
queer? And here's how that paragraph starts. The first three words, which are by a type setting

74
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:58,400
quirk, are in bold all caps are unlike gay identity. So when he sets out to define queer,

75
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:03,600
the first thing he says is it is unlike gay identity. It's something different than gay.

76
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:09,840
Queer is not the same as gay. This is why he had to do his whole exploration about the homosexual

77
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:14,160
from Foucault, because it's something different.

78
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:27,760
So what he explains the difference is, is that gay identities, as Halpern puts it,

79
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:33,280
are grounded in a positive fact. That means something about reality. They are grounded in

80
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:42,000
the positive fact of homosexuality. Now Halpern does not actually say that gay is something that

81
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:48,560
is intrinsic and essential to the person as an accident of birth, because he says that it's grounded

82
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:56,480
in the positive fact of homosexual object choice. That's his actual phrase, which means that it

83
00:08:56,480 --> 00:09:05,280
might be the choosing of same-sex desire. He doesn't go so far as to say it's innate,

84
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:14,000
but he does say that it's real, the positive fact of homosexuality. Queer, he is contrasting to that,

85
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:18,720
and he says explicitly that it need not be based on any positive truth or in any stable

86
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:24,480
reality at all. And he says there is nothing in particular to which it refers. Queer doesn't

87
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:29,680
mean anything in particular is what he's saying. He calls it an identity without an essence. That

88
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:38,560
means, unlike gay identities, it is not based in reality. So what is queer if it is not based in

89
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:44,560
reality? It is a radical political view. In fact, if we want to pull from the Antonio Gramsci ideas

90
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:51,120
of cultural Marxism, it is a counter hegemonic idea. There's this idea that we have prevailing

91
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:56,080
cultural values and they tend to maintain themselves and transmit themselves and stabilize

92
00:09:56,080 --> 00:10:05,680
people and themselves, and that's cultural hegemony. The way things are, and queer is a defiant

93
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:12,240
oppositional position against that. In other words, it's counter hegemonic. Just like Antonio

94
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:18,240
Gramsci said, the point of what we now call cultural Marxism or Western Marxism is to establish

95
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:22,720
counter hegemonic infiltration into our institutions. So bringing queer theory into

96
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:27,760
institutions, whether education, law, whatever happens to be, media doesn't matter.

97
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:34,080
Bringing queer theory into institutions is a counter hegemonic activity in line with

98
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:41,280
Gramsci's Western Marxism, which we often call cultural Marxism. Halperin tells us that queer

99
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:48,720
means adopting a politics that is against whatever the normal, the legitimate, and the

100
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:55,200
dominant are. And so you can tell I'm not just making it up. Here's exactly how he phrases it.

101
00:10:55,760 --> 00:11:01,280
Unlike gay identity, which though deliberately proclaimed in an act of affirmation is

102
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:07,520
nonetheless rooted in the positive fact of homosexual object choice, queer identity

103
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:14,560
need not be grounded in any positive truth or in any stable reality. As the very word implies,

104
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:21,600
queer does not name some natural kind or refer to some determinate object.

105
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:29,280
See, it's not real. It acquires its meaning from its oppositional relation to the norm.

106
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:37,120
Queer is by definition whatever is at odds with the normal, the legitimate, the dominant.

107
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:43,760
There is nothing in particular to which it necessarily refers. It is an identity without

108
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:50,320
an essence. Now, I'm cutting off here a lot of how actually psychotic David Halperin is

109
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:56,880
when I present it this way. I have the book open, so I'll just read to you a little bit more. He

110
00:11:56,880 --> 00:12:03,440
says queer then demarcates not a positivity, that means something real, but a positionality,

111
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:09,440
that means a politics, vis-a-vis the normative. Here's where it gets weird. They can't leave it

112
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:15,040
alone. A positionality that is not restricted to lesbians and gay men, so it's not really about

113
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:22,560
being gay, but is in fact available to anyone who is or feels marginalized. You don't even have to

114
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:29,520
be marginalized. You just have to feel marginalized because of her or his sexual practices. It could

115
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:36,000
include some married couples without children, for example, or even, who knows, some married couples

116
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:42,800
with children, with perhaps very naughty children. I'm just going to pause. What the hell is he

117
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:46,480
talking about? I'll let you speculate. What the hell is he talking about? Why does he say that it

118
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:51,520
could be couples who are married with very naughty children, very naughties and italics? What does

119
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:59,200
he mean here? Why do they always go there? But I'll continue the rest of the page. Queer, he says,

120
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:05,440
in any case, does not designate a class of already objectified pathologies or perversions,

121
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:14,160
so it's not just about that. Rather, it describes a horizon of possibility, just like communism

122
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:19,840
is a horizon of possibility for socialist praxis. It describes a horizon of possibility

123
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:27,040
whose precise extent and heterogeneous scope cannot, in principle, be delimited in advance.

124
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:36,160
It is queer Marxism, in other words. It is from the eccentric positionality occupied by the queer

125
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:46,080
subject, so it's subjective. It's not real, that it may become possible to envision a variety of

126
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:53,040
possibilities for reordering the relations among sexual behaviors, erotic identities, constructions

127
00:13:53,040 --> 00:14:04,080
of gender, forms of knowledge, regimes of enunciation, logics of representation, modes of self-constitution,

128
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:11,520
and practices of community for restructuring, that is, the relations among power, truth,

129
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:18,720
and, of all things he could pick, desire. This is why in the Drag Queen Story Hour paper,

130
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:23,760
it says explicitly that Drag Queen Story Hour, or Queer Worldmaking, as I think what it actually

131
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:31,520
says, Queer Worldmaking, is always a project rooted in desire. He underscores his point, though,

132
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:35,840
that it's not about gay identities by saying that it's not restricted to lesbians and gay men,

133
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:42,720
but in fact that it's open to anyone who is or feels marginalized because of his or her sexual

134
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:45,840
practices. So what are we dealing with? We're dealing with something that doesn't have a lot

135
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:51,440
to do with gay identity at all when we're talking about queer and thus queer theory,

136
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:58,880
and we're talking about something that is rooted in sex because of his or her sexual practices.

137
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:05,040
It's right there in the text, it's extremely clear. But what is the conclusion that we draw from this

138
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:11,760
discussion that Halpern gives us, the defining characteristic of queer in queer theory? It

139
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:18,240
is that you cannot be queer. Do you understand me? There's no such thing as a queer identity.

140
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:28,560
There is, let me say it again, no such thing as a queer identity. You can only do queerness. You can

141
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:34,480
only act queer, and that's what it is. It's an act, and that's why with Judith Butler's work,

142
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:39,840
we see that her work could boil down to drag is life and life is drag, and that the enlightened

143
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:44,320
people or the people who know we're always doing a drag performance. What do I mean by that? If I'm

144
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:49,840
a man and I present as a man and look like a man and act like a man and am a man, I'm just doing

145
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:56,160
male drag as a man. And if I'm a woman and I'm doing female drag, or I'm sorry, if I'm a woman

146
00:15:56,160 --> 00:16:02,960
and I present myself as a woman and live according to feminine choices and stereotypes

147
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:07,520
and activities and so on, I'm just doing female drag. And if I'm a male who does female drag,

148
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:12,640
I'm still just doing drag, but now I've chosen to do it. I'm not just doing it like a socialized

149
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:21,360
robot. I'm awake and I've chosen to do that in a defiance of the norm. So nobody is queer. People

150
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:28,160
feel queer against some standard. In other words, they feel defiantly opposed. And I keep using this

151
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:32,480
language, by the way, oppositional defiant. Oppositional defiant. Why? Because there's a

152
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:37,120
disorder known as oppositional defiant disorder, which seems to fit the bill here.

153
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:47,600
They are people who feel and act against the norm and against legitimacy on purpose. So they are

154
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:54,480
not queer. They are acting queerly. And that means they are acting defiantly against normalcy and

155
00:16:54,480 --> 00:17:03,280
legitimacy, while denying and even decrying reality. You can only perform queerness. That's

156
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:09,040
what Judith Butler's work is really about, gender performativity. You can only perform queerness,

157
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:13,280
but they think everything is a form of queerness. You just don't know. You're either upholding

158
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:21,520
the status quo, or you're rejecting it. So you can only perform queerness, or if you refuse

159
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:27,680
their liberatory politics as they see them, you can perform straightness instead. Performing

160
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:32,960
straightness to queer theory isn't being who you are if you're straight, just like gender

161
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:37,680
performance. It's just another kind of performance, one that upholds the allegedly oppressive status

162
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:44,400
quo instead of opposing it, which is thus problematic. We see the same theme in the

163
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:50,480
Drag Queen Story Hour paper from a couple of years ago. Let me see if I actually found this

164
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:58,400
other quote from Foucault, just to kind of really drive in the point. I know that I have it in this

165
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:04,320
other document. Yeah, he says, this is Halpern talking about Foucault, the homosexual. He says,

166
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:09,600
Foucault insisted that homosexuality did not name an already existing form of desire, but was rather

167
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:15,840
something to be desired. So it doesn't describe a way of being romantically or sexually attracted

168
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:23,440
to people. It's something that you want to become. It's an identity you seek to become.

169
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:28,720
He says, our task is therefore to become homosexual, that's quoting from Foucault,

170
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:35,040
not to persist in acknowledging that we are homosexual. Or to put it more precisely,

171
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:41,200
what Foucault meant is that our task is to become queer. For his remarks make sense only if he

172
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:46,640
understood the term homosexual according to my definition of queer. Remember we're reading David

173
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:52,960
Halpern here. As an identity without an essence, not a given condition, but a horizon of possibility,

174
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:59,760
an opportunity for self-transformation, a queer potential. Because one can't become homosexual

175
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:08,080
strictly speaking. Either one is or one isn't. But one can listen to this shit. One can marginalize

176
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:16,560
oneself. One can transform oneself. One can become queer. Indeed queer marks the very sight of gay

177
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:25,520
becoming. So that is what Halpern is saying is the point of queer theory. And that's what meshes

178
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:30,800
with the dry queen story hour paper that I was about to jump to. So I just want to remind you

179
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:35,920
that in that paper there is a section near the end titled From Empathy to Embodied Kinship. It makes

180
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:41,280
the same point we just made. That section makes the point that queer programs are presented as

181
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:48,560
improving LGBT empathy in their words. And that dry queen story hour makes use of such tropes again

182
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:53,600
their word. It then says that that's not really what dry queen story hour is about at all.

183
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:59,920
It says that's not what queer education or queer world making are about either.

184
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:05,840
Instead they use the so-called tropes of empathy strategically, that's their word,

185
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:12,240
as a marketing platform. That's their word too. To justify getting it into schools, libraries,

186
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:18,960
and in front of kids. But it's actually not about empathy at all. It's about leading the kids to see

187
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:25,440
the world in themselves in a queer way. In other words to lead them into a queer worldview. World

188
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:33,360
views, by the way, have ideologies. The ideology of the queer worldview is queer theory. So it is the

189
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:39,440
doctrine of a sex-based cult that primarily targets children should add through manipulation and

190
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:44,480
deception. And it has very little to do with gay people. Here's how it's worded in the dry queen

191
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:49,120
story hour paper in the relevant part. Finally they say it is often assumed that that's Lil Miss

192
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:54,880
Hot Mess and Harper Keenan. Drag queen at Arizona State University, whose real name is Harris

193
00:20:54,880 --> 00:21:03,600
Cornstein. And Harper Keenan is a trans education researcher somewhere, I don't know, maybe Canada.

194
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:09,520
Finally they say it is often assumed that the primary pedagogical tool of queer education

195
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:14,720
should be to increase empathy toward LGBT people. That's what you've heard. That's why we're supposed

196
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:19,280
to have drag queen story hour because we have to care about the poor little gay kids who don't have

197
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:24,080
representation and apparently needed a drag queen to look at to feel represented. They go on to say

198
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:29,360
while this premise has some merit and it underlies many sincere projects and educational and cultural

199
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:34,400
work including drag queen story hour, the notion of empathy has also been critiqued by feminist

200
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:39,840
scholars of color and others for the ways in which, notice they throw that intersectional

201
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:44,880
kitchen sink. This is about drag queens but it's been critiqued by feminist scholars of color and

202
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:51,600
others for the ways in which empathy can enable an effective, emotional effective, A effective

203
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:57,360
with an A not an E, an effective appropriation of an individual's unique experiences and

204
00:21:57,360 --> 00:22:02,240
reinforce hierarchies of power. That's a lot. But what they're saying is that when you can start,

205
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:08,000
basically that you can do munch housings by proxy, you can start to show empathy in order

206
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:12,320
to elevate yourself and thus cause problems for the people you're allegedly empathetic toward.

207
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:18,560
Whether through literature or virtual reality, these tropes tend to reflect an overstated ability

208
00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:23,680
to understand difference as well as empathy's potential to preclude meaningful relationships

209
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:29,680
of solidarity. See, you can't be in solidarity with somebody you feel sorry for. They go on and

210
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:34,560
say it is undeniable that drag queen story hour participates in many of these tropes of empathy

211
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:42,240
from the marketing language the program uses to its selection of books. And here it is. Much of

212
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:50,320
this is done strategically in order to justify its educational value. However, we suggest that drag

213
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:56,640
supports scholars' critiques of empathy rather than reifying the concept. Reifying in the sense of

214
00:22:56,640 --> 00:23:01,600
George Lukacz, one of the other founders or fathers of cultural Marxism, to means to make real

215
00:23:02,560 --> 00:23:10,560
through social processes. This approach can, this is them again, this approach can support

216
00:23:10,560 --> 00:23:16,000
students in finding the unique or queer aspects of themselves rather than attempting to understand

217
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:22,320
what it is like to be LGBT. So what they're telling you is that the point is grooming people into a

218
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:28,320
queer ideological worldview, children in particular, not about increasing empathy. It's not about

219
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:32,960
understanding. Duh, obviously, they aren't putting a drag queen in front of the kids because it's

220
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:38,080
trying to teach kids what it's like to be gay. Drag queens are a horrific represent like misrepresentation

221
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:46,320
of that phenomenon. It's to support students in finding the unique or queer aspects of themselves.

222
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:52,240
That's what it's really about. Drag queen story hour is not about empathy. That's their marketing

223
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:58,400
strategy and it is in fact to their eyes a bit problematic. So they know that they're lying

224
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:04,560
about it in a way that actually goes against their values in order to get it into the schools and

225
00:24:04,560 --> 00:24:08,720
libraries and in front of children in general. But what it's really about is getting kids to

226
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:15,280
discover any aspects of themselves that they might feel uncomfortable about or marginalized because of

227
00:24:15,280 --> 00:24:20,720
or different because of that might be able to be considered queer by a queer theorist or queer

228
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:27,360
educator so that those aspects can be nurtured in the sense of making them have more and more and

229
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:34,720
more discomfort about themselves and then until an initiatory rupture occurs so that they can

230
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:43,200
develop the children into a queer political stance that will then be conflated with being who they

231
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:47,600
really are. That's what's going on with queer theory. That's what Halpern is actually describing.

232
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:52,320
By calling them queer identities what you're doing is saying here's this political activity

233
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:56,720
and you're going to pretend that that political activity is who you are. By the way that political

234
00:24:56,720 --> 00:25:02,560
activity is hating the world as it is and hating people for being normal and hating

235
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:09,920
anything that is is based in the idea of legitimacy. So oppositional defiant disorder

236
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:18,000
as a political stance that you're now going to consider to be who you are which is in fact

237
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:24,880
in the definition of queer not what it's about. So what will happen is they take these kids they

238
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:31,120
introduce them to queer potentialities by sticking a drag queen in front of them and then they make

239
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:36,240
them feel uncomfortable about themselves and they exploit that uncomfortable or emotional crisis or

240
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:41,200
whatever it is to make them feel isolated and alone and then they say there's a new way to

241
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:46,640
understand yourself and there's a new way to understand who you are and the world and why it

242
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:53,200
doesn't like you. So then they can awaken to some basic ideas of queer theory and more than that

243
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:59,920
they'll be told that they're not truly allowed to be who they really are. Society will object.

244
00:26:00,560 --> 00:26:04,880
Their parents will object. In particular they'll focus on the objection to the parents because

245
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:10,000
they have to get the kids away from their parents whose parental duty and responsibility it is to

246
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:17,600
protect them from this kind of ideological and maybe worse grooming. In fact it's so likely that

247
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:24,320
their parents will reject this this discovery of who they really are as queer that it may have to be

248
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:30,560
kept secret from their parents in case it wouldn't be affirmed by them and don't worry the state

249
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:36,320
depending on what state you're in and now more than a dozen states will force your parents to

250
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:41,280
affirm this or threaten to take your children away or maybe take them away for real. I'm not supposed

251
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:46,640
to use I know the word grooming to describe this grotesque set of activities that's a part of a

252
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:51,920
major controversy. In fact it's part of it's one of the main reasons that these kids came dressed

253
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:57,760
as clowns to protest me at Pitt when I gave this talk but I'm not supposed to call these people

254
00:26:57,760 --> 00:27:02,960
groomers because it makes the left mad that we call them what they are so I'm going to ask a

255
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:08,160
question instead. Instead of saying this is obviously groomer behavior and I know I already

256
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:13,120
did let's back up let's slow down let's be a little more careful Jim. I'm going to show you

257
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:18,080
something else from this paper and I'm going to ask this question what word am I supposed to use

258
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:24,640
for it. We've already talked about this idea of from empathy to embodied kinship but I'm going

259
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:30,480
to read something else from this paper and I want to know what word I am supposed to use for it.

260
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:36,480
Drag Queen Story Hour presents itself as family friendly in a way that characterizes itself as

261
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:42,480
a preparatory introduction to alternate modes of kinship. That's what it says. What does that mean?

262
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:48,880
What does that mean? Preparatory introduction to alternate modes of kinship. In fact it says the

263
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:54,560
family and family friendly refers to a queer code for the other queers they connect with on

264
00:27:54,560 --> 00:28:01,600
the street rather than the family that's like the real family. So the Drag Queen Story Hour people

265
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:07,600
are not just lying about the idea that they use empathy but they're also lying about what they

266
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:13,360
mean by family when they sell it as family friendly. They tell us themselves in black and white that

267
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:18,880
they mean it is a queer code for a new family, a queer family, a drag family that Drag Queen Story

268
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:24,240
Hour is teaching kids to become friendly to. That's what they mean by family friendly but they want

269
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:29,200
you to think it means that yeah adults and parents and little kids and their grandparents are all

270
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:34,320
welcome to come watch. The paper in fact repeatedly invokes the concept of a drag family for the kids

271
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:40,480
that they would you know obviously latch on to in order to develop their queer aspects of themselves

272
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:44,800
and then the last sentence of the paper the last half of that sentence anyway is

273
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:49,280
we'll leave a trail of glitter that will never come out of the carpet. Well what's the carpet

274
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:55,360
here seems like it's probably children's minds doesn't seem like that's on the up and up now

275
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:59,200
remember that I'm going to read the actual full quote I've just talked about it. Let me read the

276
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:03,280
real quote to you the real paragraph and the question is what word am I supposed to use for

277
00:29:03,280 --> 00:29:07,920
this because I'm not supposed to call it grooming okay so here's a full the full quote of that family

278
00:29:07,920 --> 00:29:12,960
friendly part so you don't think I'm lying even though I did a podcast about it before queer

279
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:18,320
world making including political organizing has long been a project driven by desire that's what I

280
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:24,960
said earlier it isn't part enacted through art sorry it enacted through art forms like fashion

281
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:30,800
theater and drag so queer world making is enacted through art forms like fashion theater and drag

282
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:36,320
notice it's not math or physics or history we believe that drag queen story hour offers an

283
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:42,480
invitation toward deeper public engagement with queer cultural production particularly for young

284
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:47,360
children and their families this one of those times where I want to have like digital slowdown

285
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:56,720
particularly for young children and their families particularly for young children

286
00:29:56,720 --> 00:30:03,120
do you get the point particularly for young children it may be that drag queen story hour is

287
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:08,000
quote family friendly in the sense that it is accessible and inviting to families with children

288
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:15,280
that's what we call the mod but it is less a sanitizing force than it is a preparatory introduction

289
00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:23,840
to alternate modes of kinship period that's the bailey here drag queen story hour is quote family

290
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:30,720
friendly in the sense of quote family as an old school queer code to identify and connect with

291
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:40,720
other queers on the street so I'm asking I can't use the word groomer what word am I supposed to

292
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:50,160
use for that I know which word I can't use and that puts me at a complete loss but what I have

293
00:30:50,160 --> 00:30:57,680
actually described to you isn't just drag queen story hour it is queer pedagogy it is queer education

294
00:30:57,680 --> 00:31:04,400
it is the installing of queer theory into children by means of the educational system and

295
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:10,400
educational methodologies both in terms of curriculum and in terms of teaching methods

296
00:31:11,920 --> 00:31:18,960
so here's how queer theory works you can't describe it you can't say anything about it

297
00:31:19,520 --> 00:31:26,480
unless you support it because otherwise you were applying power to it you were being unjust you were

298
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:35,200
doing anti-lgbtq hate you didn't engage properly because if you engaged properly that means that you

299
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:41,680
took on the worldview and agreed with it you can't even talk about queer theory according to queer

300
00:31:41,680 --> 00:31:48,400
theorists unless you support it it is just like a cult one that targets kids as we can clearly see

301
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:54,400
one that is based in sex and one that doesn't have a lot to do with gay people remember if you

302
00:31:54,400 --> 00:32:00,240
criticize queer theory that's anti-lgbtq hate you will end up with a profile if you're

303
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:05,840
high enough profile individual such as myself on the southern poverty law center accusing you of

304
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:12,720
anti-lgbtq hate of hate speech of malice of all these things you'll get accused of homophobia

305
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:19,120
transphobia and the famous term is anti-lgbtq hate I'm going to keep coming back to that because

306
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:24,320
there's so many things out there claiming that people such as me and others engage in anti-lgbtq

307
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:35,440
hate all you have to do to engage in anti-lgbtq hate is read queer theory out loud word for word

308
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:41,920
as it is written by queer theorists themselves and say that's bad so there's a rumor widely

309
00:32:41,920 --> 00:32:47,280
printed about me that I because of my use of the word groomer to describe what we just talked about

310
00:32:47,280 --> 00:32:52,080
implicates me in some social crime called anti-lgbtq hate which is apparently very bad very serious

311
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:57,840
and early toxic even though all it means is not agreeing with queer theory it's not just harmful

312
00:32:57,840 --> 00:33:03,600
rhetoric it's in fact also a conspiracy theory they say and I am not just a very bad person

313
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:10,720
which obviously I must be but also a very crazy person for naming the obvious not as a result of

314
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:16,720
inference not as a result of guesswork not as a result of any emotions that I have but literally

315
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:24,480
just by reading out loud and saying exactly what their own proudly printed writings say

316
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:31,840
without any need to embellish without any need to interpret I just tell you what it says and say

317
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:38,480
by the way they mean it when they say the empathy is a marketing trope and family friendly is a

318
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:44,560
marketing trope but they really mean something else that there is a Mott and Bailey rhetorical

319
00:33:44,560 --> 00:33:52,400
strategy in play here I'm not in Bailey actual dialectical lie here all I'm doing you is telling

320
00:33:52,400 --> 00:34:00,880
you what they've written making taking some of the veneer off of it and now I am a conspiracy

321
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:08,160
theorist I am a hater I have a southern poverty law center article and a profile written up about

322
00:34:08,160 --> 00:34:11,360
me do you think well who cares that's like a badge of honor and I take it that way obviously

323
00:34:11,360 --> 00:34:15,840
that's why I called myself general hate but stop for two seconds and realize

324
00:34:16,720 --> 00:34:21,200
that if I get called to do some professional thing that's going to get brought up as a reason

325
00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:25,920
why I'm not supposed to be there if I try to give a talk and protesters try to get a shutdown

326
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:31,440
they're going to leverage that against some wavering or even complicit institutional

327
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:38,160
administration to keep me out they know how this works the accusation and the resulting

328
00:34:38,160 --> 00:34:43,600
social dynamic which is always hostile is straight out of Maoism it's straight out of Maoist China

329
00:34:43,600 --> 00:34:50,400
from the 1950s and 60s I have been alleged to be engaging in a crime called anti LGBTQ hate

330
00:34:51,120 --> 00:34:56,720
and the right side of history and right side of society which are on the right side of history

331
00:34:56,720 --> 00:35:03,680
are called to judge me bully me hold me to account for that crime by whatever means it can manage

332
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:08,960
the bullying is to continue until I learn to recognize my crime from the queer position

333
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:16,320
in other words I adopted the positionality of queer theory and see how what I said or what I did

334
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:22,160
was actually socially criminal and I pledged to reform my thought by adopting queer theory

335
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:26,720
so that I can not only do better but also become an activist on behalf of queer theory it's a life

336
00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:35,280
long commitment to self reflection self critique and social activism this is identical to the

337
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:41,680
thought reform programs of Mao's China it's just a slightly different ideology of course their

338
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:46,320
accusation is absolute nonsense but that's not the point the point is to initiate the social

339
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:51,360
struggle session on me in order to transform my views to ones that are either at least empathetic

340
00:35:51,360 --> 00:35:58,960
to or ideally that embrace and repeat queer theory the accusation is of an old Marxist standard

341
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:04,240
form truth married to a lie and here's the truth gays and lesbians fought for decades to break the

342
00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:09,360
public perception that they are predators and groomers of children but here's the lie that's

343
00:36:09,360 --> 00:36:14,320
who and what I'm talking about when I criticize their theory and activism in other words I'm not

344
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:20,560
talking about gay people just like Halpern's not talking about gay people unlike gay identity

345
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:25,520
I'm talking about people who are deliberately engaging in the ideological and maybe worse

346
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:31,840
transformation of children into a queer political identity that's who I'm talking about

347
00:36:31,840 --> 00:36:36,800
but the the the lie is that I'm talking about gays and lesbians or maybe trans people at large

348
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:42,560
when I criticize their own theory and activism and point out that what they say in their own words

349
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:49,680
needs a word it sounds seems very groomery even if I can't say groomer about it and we're all not

350
00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:54,000
supposed to of course we can say that and we do say that and it's not hate to point it out it's

351
00:36:54,000 --> 00:37:02,320
right there in black and white but this has nothing to do with any of that the truth is that queer

352
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:06,880
used to be a slur for gay people so the activists took it on to describe themselves in defiance

353
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:12,480
of prejudice and bigotry but also because it now becomes impossible to talk about it oh queer

354
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:18,480
theory you're using a slur there's there's a there's a situation the lie is that queer theory

355
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:23,280
ever represented civil rights movements for anyone or gay people in particular in fact it was the

356
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:28,640
opposite it was against everything that the gay civil rights movement was about queer theory is a

357
00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:33,600
destructive form of radical activism because it's a marxist theory so there has to be activism

358
00:37:33,600 --> 00:37:38,800
connected it's not just a theory it's theory and practice combined and it is a destructive form of

359
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:43,920
radical activism that actually historically opposed gay civil rights inequality well why in the world

360
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:49,520
would it do that aren't they the same thing no of course not because gay equality and gay acceptance

361
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:56,640
would normalize being gay within society and would legitimize normalcy and legitimacy right

362
00:37:56,640 --> 00:38:02,560
legitimize gay people as fully equal members of society queer theory is by definition radically

363
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:07,760
opposed on principle to anything normal and legitimate they even have a word for what would

364
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:14,720
happen if we had gay equality and gay acceptance homonormativity which is society accepting

365
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:20,320
gay as being part of the normal expression of what it means to be human sometimes and that would

366
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:25,360
mean it's within the normative framework now and the gay people are expected to okay you're great

367
00:38:25,360 --> 00:38:30,720
you're gay so what great get a put on a suit and get a job and that would all be very bad because

368
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:35,840
they're no longer radical activists gay activists who are listening to this from the 1990s can readily

369
00:38:35,840 --> 00:38:40,400
back me up on this they'll readily attest that the queer activists were often strongly opposed to

370
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:47,040
their ambitions for civil and legal equality for marriage and for social acceptance they just were

371
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:52,480
why because they wanted radicals queer theory needs radical activists not stable citizens who can go

372
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:57,840
about their lives in a society that doesn't in any way meaningfully discriminate against them

373
00:38:57,840 --> 00:39:02,320
they need there to be discrimination or the appearance of hate or the the fear that there

374
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:08,800
will be the bad old times coming back in order to radicalize those people into revolutionary activity

375
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:13,120
or just to show up and be human shields for the queer theorists who are doing that

376
00:39:15,360 --> 00:39:18,800
the civil rights activists and the gay civil rights movements in the

377
00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:26,880
80s 90s and so on fought hard for decades to over starting at least in the 50s to overcome

378
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:30,800
stereotypes of predatory behavior and the idea that they're intrinsically groomers

379
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:36,720
and that's why the queer theorists actually claim that or that's why they're actually able to claim

380
00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:44,000
that calling out their blatant grooming is anti lgbt lgbtq they're saying look

381
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:50,880
50 60 years ago 30 years ago people said that all gay gay people are groomers and gay rights just

382
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:56,560
enables groomers and the gays the gay civil rights leaders fought back and said no that is not what

383
00:39:56,560 --> 00:40:03,120
we're about that is nothing to do with who we are that is a harmful stereotype and they won we

384
00:40:03,120 --> 00:40:08,400
trusted them and now you have these freaks and weirdos who are queer theorists who were never

385
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:14,880
particularly interested in civil rights at all who are saying if you call them which is the

386
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:22,320
narrower narrower subset the q not even all the rest of it if you call the q groomers then what

387
00:40:22,320 --> 00:40:28,800
you are doing is anti lgbtq hate you see how the acronym works to create human shields

388
00:40:30,160 --> 00:40:40,560
do you understand that l lesbian g gay b bisexual t trans q queer all different all different

389
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:44,560
lesbians are women who are attracted to women by the way you have to know what a woman is to make

390
00:40:44,560 --> 00:40:49,280
that work gays are men who are attracted to men you have to know what men are to make that work

391
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:54,640
bisexuals are people who are attracted to men and women by two so you have to believe in the

392
00:40:54,640 --> 00:41:02,640
binary to make that work trans people it's its own complicated topic but they are men or women

393
00:41:02,640 --> 00:41:08,400
who do not recognize themselves as men or women and in fact may actually recognize themselves

394
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:15,520
as the opposite so something's very different there and then q is queer and we already heard

395
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:18,720
that queer has nothing to do with any of that because queer is a radical political stance

396
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:27,200
but if you criticize queer you get wrapped up in anti lgbtq hate when you're not engaging in

397
00:41:28,080 --> 00:41:38,160
any anti lgb or maybe even sometimes t activity thought or anything at all it's super fake it's

398
00:41:38,160 --> 00:41:46,880
a standard trick that these kind of gnostic cults do another example is the christian nationalist

399
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:52,720
movement does the exact same trick for example if you criticize christian nationalism and you happen

400
00:41:52,720 --> 00:41:58,160
not to be a christian ask me how i know what they will say is james is attacking christians no i'm

401
00:41:58,160 --> 00:42:03,840
not i'm attacking lunatics who are hiding behind the christian identity and brand same thing with

402
00:42:03,840 --> 00:42:10,320
feminists if you do maybe ask me how i know again maybe you call radical feminists hags i don't know

403
00:42:10,320 --> 00:42:13,360
why you would do that you'd say they're a bunch of man hating hags maybe you would say that about

404
00:42:13,360 --> 00:42:17,840
radical feminists for some reason or another maybe nobody could know why you would say that but maybe

405
00:42:17,840 --> 00:42:22,880
you say that maybe you're tempted to say that and you say that and they'll say you're attacking women

406
00:42:23,520 --> 00:42:28,960
no you're not attacking women you're talk you're attacking radical feminist hags it's very clear

407
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:32,640
who you're actually talking about and they don't get to represent all women it's very much like

408
00:42:32,640 --> 00:42:37,200
when donald trump is one of my favorite donald trump incidents was in an interview with one of

409
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:41,040
these hags probably katie kerrick or something like that i don't remember the details what he was

410
00:42:41,040 --> 00:42:44,640
in this interview and they said well what about when you called women hags and luckily he knew what

411
00:42:44,640 --> 00:42:49,840
the hell they were no pigs what about when you called women pigs and uh donald trump luckily

412
00:42:49,840 --> 00:42:53,760
knew what the hell they were talking about he said i didn't call women pigs i called rosy o donal a pig

413
00:42:54,320 --> 00:43:00,000
which is hilarious because that's actually what's happening and of course i'm i'm way off script here

414
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:06,720
but this is generally what they do they blend contexts that are not the same together and treat

415
00:43:06,720 --> 00:43:12,000
them as though they're the same radical feminists might be women but they are not representative

416
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:16,320
of all women no matter how much they think that they get to be the gnostic representatives

417
00:43:16,320 --> 00:43:22,000
of true womanhood they don't get to do that so if you criticize the specific group say radical

418
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:29,600
feminists or christian nationalists or queer theorists or whatever they hide behind the general

419
00:43:29,600 --> 00:43:35,840
group by claiming to be the true representatives of that thing they're blending together the context

420
00:43:35,840 --> 00:43:42,080
of the specific their group with the general or the whole which they actually are a part of

421
00:43:42,080 --> 00:43:50,880
yes it's true when i criticize um radical feminists who happen to be women that i am

422
00:43:50,880 --> 00:43:56,880
criticizing some women but i'm not criticizing women as i don't even like to think of women

423
00:43:56,880 --> 00:44:03,680
as a class i'm criticizing particular women just like rosy o donal when i criticize

424
00:44:05,760 --> 00:44:12,000
queer theorists i'm not criticizing lgbtq because lgbtq doesn't even exist that's that's a

425
00:44:12,960 --> 00:44:18,080
manufactured synthetic coalition so that queer theorists can hide behind other people who are

426
00:44:18,080 --> 00:44:22,240
sympathetic characters when i criticize christian nationalists it doesn't really matter they call

427
00:44:22,240 --> 00:44:30,160
themselves christian but they're obviously not so whatever what's happening is that the fact is

428
00:44:30,160 --> 00:44:36,000
that queer activism explicitly as we've described it so far puts the appearance of glaring truth back

429
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:41,680
into the stereotypes of groomers and then when you call them out for it they get mad and hide behind

430
00:44:41,680 --> 00:44:49,600
gay people and say see they're attacking you all you gay people see the conservatives everybody

431
00:44:49,600 --> 00:44:55,120
the society hates gay people and everyday gay people who are good citizens lose the most from

432
00:44:55,120 --> 00:45:00,000
this little trick because eventually things start to break down and the queer activists gain the

433
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:04,480
most because they end up with a larger pool of radicalism they end up with more contention and

434
00:45:04,480 --> 00:45:10,960
division in society and they end up with more instability in society queer activism is therefore

435
00:45:10,960 --> 00:45:20,080
a strictly parasitic behavior like any cult activity but about grooming more specifically i

436
00:45:20,080 --> 00:45:25,680
am talking not even necessarily about the thing that they are accusing me of i'm not when i say

437
00:45:25,680 --> 00:45:31,440
that ant that this is grooming i'm not actually talking about the sexual grooming that they try

438
00:45:31,440 --> 00:45:36,960
to pretend this is them again blending context i am grooming talking about grooming specifically

439
00:45:36,960 --> 00:45:41,840
into a cult ideology called queer theory i've been very clear about this over and over again you

440
00:45:41,840 --> 00:45:46,480
can look the word up type in the word grooming and see what it means yes there is the idea of sexual

441
00:45:46,480 --> 00:45:52,000
grooming and oh there it is ideological or political or whatever other professional grooming

442
00:45:53,360 --> 00:45:58,720
but just to really drive home that they are doing ideological grooming like it's not already clear

443
00:45:58,720 --> 00:46:04,480
let's direct our attention to another scholar another queer educator kevin commissaro who wrote

444
00:46:04,480 --> 00:46:10,480
a paper in 2002 called against repetition and i remind you against repetition means against the

445
00:46:10,480 --> 00:46:16,800
repetition of the existing society by teaching kids to be queer activists anyway in that paper he

446
00:46:16,800 --> 00:46:23,040
describes the purpose of queer education for children and commissaro explicitly says that

447
00:46:23,040 --> 00:46:29,920
teaching children about social justice including about ideas from queer theory is meant to induce in

448
00:46:29,920 --> 00:46:36,720
fact it is the obligation of the teacher to do this to induce an emotional and identity based

449
00:46:36,720 --> 00:46:43,680
crisis in them he then says that's why it's so important to have queer educators in place

450
00:46:43,680 --> 00:46:49,040
who can guide the the now vulnerable students who are experiencing emotional crisis so that

451
00:46:49,040 --> 00:46:54,960
those crises are resolved in favor of social justice and queer theory here are some relevant

452
00:46:54,960 --> 00:47:00,320
quotes from the paper from pages 74 and 75 he says repeating what is already learned can be

453
00:47:00,320 --> 00:47:04,480
comforting and therefore desirable students learning things that question their knowledge

454
00:47:05,040 --> 00:47:11,600
and identities on the other hand can be emotionally upsetting for example suppose students think

455
00:47:11,600 --> 00:47:17,680
society is meritocratic but learn that it is racist raise your hand if you're sick of this

456
00:47:17,680 --> 00:47:23,680
shit or think that they themselves are not contributing to homophobia but learn that they

457
00:47:23,680 --> 00:47:30,720
in fact are raise your hand if you're sick of this shit in such situations students learn that the

458
00:47:30,720 --> 00:47:37,280
ways that they think and act are not only limited but also oppressive learning about oppression

459
00:47:37,280 --> 00:47:42,880
and about the ways they often unknowingly comply with oppression can lead students to feel

460
00:47:44,080 --> 00:47:50,320
paralyzed with anger sadness anxiety and guilt it can lead to a form of emotional crisis

461
00:47:51,040 --> 00:47:56,320
they think this is an educational mandate this is what the point of education is and then he says

462
00:47:56,320 --> 00:48:01,760
once in a crisis students can go in many directions some that may lead to anti oppressive change

463
00:48:01,760 --> 00:48:08,160
others that may lead to a more entrenched resistance therefore educators have a responsibility not

464
00:48:08,160 --> 00:48:13,280
only to draw students into a possible crisis but also to structure experiences that can help

465
00:48:13,280 --> 00:48:19,840
them work through their crises productively let's just pause for a second educators have a

466
00:48:19,840 --> 00:48:27,520
responsibility to draw students into possible crisis that's a real sentence and then they also

467
00:48:27,520 --> 00:48:31,520
are meant to structure the environment and experiences around the student to get them

468
00:48:31,520 --> 00:48:38,560
to go in a particular direction that's cult indoctrination it's knowingly willfully and

469
00:48:38,560 --> 00:48:44,480
deliberately cult indoctrination but other scholars in the same domains confirm this for us

470
00:48:44,560 --> 00:48:50,880
there's another paper in 2019 two scholars torres and fairy they say it explicitly

471
00:48:52,480 --> 00:48:57,520
in a paper called not everyone gets a seat at the table they say it explicitly that this is

472
00:48:57,520 --> 00:49:02,320
what their model of education represents that it's in and i mean it that it's indoctrination

473
00:49:02,320 --> 00:49:07,520
here's how they said it for all the criticism teachers receive for quote indoctrinating

474
00:49:07,520 --> 00:49:12,480
students turning them into liberal minded cry babies not much has been said in defense

475
00:49:12,480 --> 00:49:18,880
at the very least a shy denial is made it is time for educators to own this criticism and admit

476
00:49:18,880 --> 00:49:24,560
that is exactly what we do there it is in black and white on page 33 of not everyone gets a seat

477
00:49:24,560 --> 00:49:29,760
at the table you can read these quotes in the querying of the american child where logan lansing

478
00:49:30,560 --> 00:49:36,880
put them he found these these quotes actually i did not but what kevin kumashiro is describing

479
00:49:36,880 --> 00:49:41,440
is actually worse than the indoctrination that torres and fairy are talking about saying that

480
00:49:41,440 --> 00:49:47,920
that's exactly what they do a cycle of inducing crisis and then resolving it toward a particular

481
00:49:47,920 --> 00:49:54,240
doctrine isn't indoctrination it's trauma bonding that's a practice of ideological

482
00:49:54,240 --> 00:50:02,720
transformation or thought reform or brainwashing or cult grooming so it can be pretty plainly said

483
00:50:02,720 --> 00:50:07,120
queer theory practices thought reform and it practices thought reform because queer theory

484
00:50:07,120 --> 00:50:11,840
is the doctrine of a religious cult we already see that that cult is based on sex and that it

485
00:50:11,840 --> 00:50:16,000
primarily targets children and that it has little or nothing to do with with being gay

486
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:23,520
so that pretty much lays out my primary thesis that's what queer theory is now of course fine it's

487
00:50:23,520 --> 00:50:29,840
a cult what now well nobody joins a cult to join a cult so do you want to have in mind that the

488
00:50:29,840 --> 00:50:34,320
people in it don't know it's a cult and in fact they may not even know that they are subscribed

489
00:50:34,400 --> 00:50:38,000
to queer theory or that queer theory is a critical constructivist ideology of sex

490
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:42,400
gender and sexuality they probably don't know those things as a matter of fact

491
00:50:43,360 --> 00:50:47,680
but people don't the point is people don't join a cult to go find a cult and join it nobody says

492
00:50:47,680 --> 00:50:50,880
in the morning hey i'm going to get up and go find a cult and join a cult because i don't have

493
00:50:50,880 --> 00:50:56,640
anything better to do people join a cult because they are suffering in some way and the cult comes

494
00:50:56,640 --> 00:51:03,120
in parasitically and offers them some false resolution to their suffering it seems like

495
00:51:03,120 --> 00:51:08,080
something that will get them out of loneliness out of spiritual malaise out of vulnerability of

496
00:51:08,080 --> 00:51:14,080
some kind virtually everyone who has ever escaped a cult tells this same story they wanted to belong

497
00:51:14,080 --> 00:51:18,160
they wanted a social circle they wanted to understanding they wanted purpose in life they

498
00:51:18,160 --> 00:51:25,920
wanted something to do the cult preys upon these people and slowly locks them in one of the tools

499
00:51:25,920 --> 00:51:32,080
they use is trauma bonding one of the tools they use is separating people from their their family

500
00:51:32,080 --> 00:51:38,880
and friends what's trauma bonding though that sounds bad besides what Kevin Kumashuro says

501
00:51:38,880 --> 00:51:43,440
is the point of queer education or education for social justice trauma bonding is as harmful

502
00:51:43,440 --> 00:51:50,000
and manipulative as it sounds it is the technique of cult initiation i should say and abuse it's

503
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:56,080
basically like hazing the basic formula is really simple first you traumatize your targets until you've

504
00:51:56,080 --> 00:52:00,560
harmed them enough for the process to work and then you celebrate them when you do it when they

505
00:52:00,560 --> 00:52:05,280
do what you want and you don't celebrate them or even punish them more when they do what you don't

506
00:52:05,280 --> 00:52:11,280
want that's it they will bond with the people traumatizing them because of the rewards they

507
00:52:11,280 --> 00:52:17,840
get when the trauma is the traumatic experience is is lightened up this is what robert lifton in

508
00:52:17,840 --> 00:52:23,440
thought reform in the psychology of totalism refers to as an alternating cycle of harshness

509
00:52:23,440 --> 00:52:30,080
and leniency and that's key to how cult bonding works or thought reform works as a matter of fact

510
00:52:30,080 --> 00:52:35,280
which is basically the same thing so in queer theory what you do is you take people particularly

511
00:52:35,280 --> 00:52:40,320
kids and you tell them the world isn't at all the way that it seems and in fact neither are they

512
00:52:40,320 --> 00:52:44,320
and it isn't the way that they've been led to believe if they're different it's because they're

513
00:52:44,320 --> 00:52:49,440
oppressed if they feel uncomfortable it's because society doesn't like people like them they're

514
00:52:49,440 --> 00:52:53,200
probably different than they've always been told maybe they've been lied to about themselves

515
00:52:53,200 --> 00:52:58,160
they've certainly been lied to about other people and how society should be and it's been

516
00:52:58,160 --> 00:53:03,600
holding them back and making them feel bad and maybe instead it's well maybe you're not in that

517
00:53:03,600 --> 00:53:08,320
category but the way you act hurts other people you're hurting people that's what kevin kumashiro

518
00:53:08,320 --> 00:53:13,600
actually said now if you're interested in exploring further even though you're young you should you

519
00:53:13,600 --> 00:53:19,040
should explore these feelings these guilt anxiety anger sadness weren't those the ones he talked about

520
00:53:19,040 --> 00:53:23,840
discomfort with your body discomfort with your sexuality discomfort with your social environment

521
00:53:23,840 --> 00:53:27,840
discomfort with your parents if you're uncomfortable with any of this for any reason

522
00:53:28,400 --> 00:53:34,320
maybe your body is wrong maybe your family is wrong maybe there's somebody else who you who

523
00:53:34,320 --> 00:53:39,120
is who you really are that you don't know about in society just doesn't want you to be who they

524
00:53:39,120 --> 00:53:43,120
that person is your parents don't want you to be that person either and if they're parent if your

525
00:53:43,120 --> 00:53:48,480
parents disagree maybe they're going to disagree maybe they shouldn't be included in these decisions

526
00:53:48,480 --> 00:53:54,560
maybe you need to trust a trusted adult instead maybe you need a school counselor maybe you need

527
00:53:54,560 --> 00:53:58,720
the faculty member in charge of the gay straight alliance maybe you need a teacher who has the

528
00:53:58,720 --> 00:54:04,080
flag up that represents that they're a safe space and that they won't tell on you maybe you need

529
00:54:04,080 --> 00:54:11,440
a queer family queer theory is then offered as the lens that resolves all the resulting confusion

530
00:54:11,440 --> 00:54:19,920
shock dissonance pain guilt anxiety sadness anger and vulnerability that's how this works

531
00:54:19,920 --> 00:54:23,920
and then what happens next is that you affirm and celebrate them when they show interest

532
00:54:23,920 --> 00:54:28,880
if they get interested in this think oh yeah maybe that's right maybe I am different maybe

533
00:54:28,880 --> 00:54:34,080
there maybe society's not free maybe my parents wouldn't like me thinking this or doing this maybe

534
00:54:34,080 --> 00:54:39,520
I was made wrong maybe I'm in the wrong body maybe I'm in the wrong family then you celebrate them

535
00:54:39,520 --> 00:54:44,800
you lead them to believe that they're making brave decisions that are worthy of interest

536
00:54:44,800 --> 00:54:50,640
and respect you coerce them and their social groups to participate in this ritual of affirmation

537
00:54:51,280 --> 00:54:55,760
and tacitly threaten anyone who doesn't want to go along with it or maybe not even tacitly maybe

538
00:54:55,760 --> 00:54:58,880
you talk about how not inclusive they are and how they're part of the problem and how they're

539
00:54:58,880 --> 00:55:06,000
hurting people's feelings you make the people who are taking the path feel like they belong

540
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:10,080
and that they just for being who they are are special and have a special purpose in the world

541
00:55:10,080 --> 00:55:15,040
to fulfill to change the world to transform the world to make it more accepting of people like

542
00:55:15,040 --> 00:55:20,480
them who don't get to feel that way or others that they know their friends you teach them special

543
00:55:20,480 --> 00:55:25,600
words that describe the very small but growing number of people who identify just like they do

544
00:55:25,600 --> 00:55:30,880
outside of the norm outside of what society and their parents consider legitimate this is the

545
00:55:30,880 --> 00:55:36,160
trauma bonding process of queer theory in particular in schools this is also called programming

546
00:55:36,160 --> 00:55:41,680
or grooming and it takes predictable paths the first thing it does is it leads people

547
00:55:41,680 --> 00:55:46,080
into emotional vulnerability that's what Kevin Kumashiro said what I just described by the way

548
00:55:46,080 --> 00:55:50,160
was it lead them into emotional crisis and then structure their experiences so they resolve those

549
00:55:50,160 --> 00:55:54,640
crises in the direction you want them to go in that's all I described but it leads people into

550
00:55:55,120 --> 00:56:03,600
this emotional vulnerability and into a kind of a path is offered to resolution and that generates

551
00:56:03,600 --> 00:56:08,320
personal and social interest which is followed up by psychological and social commitment they don't

552
00:56:08,320 --> 00:56:13,440
want to let the people down that they've so far impressed they want to keep feeling brave and

553
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:19,040
unique and different and special so they get a psychological commitment but also a social

554
00:56:19,040 --> 00:56:22,000
commitment these people have invested in them these people care about them these people are

555
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:25,840
supporting them and affirming them in their journeys and you're going to let them down if

556
00:56:25,840 --> 00:56:31,040
you just bail out and think maybe it's not for you this is then deepened into an increasingly deep

557
00:56:31,040 --> 00:56:38,320
social and emotional commitment to the cult that's achieved largely through repeated cycles of

558
00:56:38,320 --> 00:56:44,960
trauma bonding techniques that's how they do this that's what it means to lead people into crisis

559
00:56:44,960 --> 00:56:51,440
and structure their environment so that the crisis resolves in the desired direction this process

560
00:56:51,440 --> 00:56:58,000
creates emotionally and socially bonded members who populate the wide majority of any cult membership

561
00:56:58,800 --> 00:57:03,360
those who are socially and emotionally locked in without necessarily understanding the doctrine

562
00:57:03,360 --> 00:57:06,800
they don't have to know a word of queer theory they don't have to know queer theory exists they

563
00:57:06,800 --> 00:57:13,760
don't have to know anything all they have to do is feel like they belong in the cult and feel like

564
00:57:13,760 --> 00:57:20,640
they don't belong in the world anymore they don't need anything more than that I've called this in

565
00:57:20,640 --> 00:57:26,000
the past talking about the structure of cults the outer school of the cult the social psychological

566
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:32,640
and emotional cues are then steadily deepened over time through processes of increasing exposure

567
00:57:32,640 --> 00:57:38,880
to doctrine by processes of increasing exposure to trauma bonding by having them facilitate the

568
00:57:38,880 --> 00:57:44,960
same process on someone else who's newer in the path so that they get more and more committed to it

569
00:57:44,960 --> 00:57:56,080
the feelings the themes increasingly focus on guilt shame isolation alienation confusion

570
00:57:58,400 --> 00:58:03,760
at least on the one hand but meanwhile they're also talking about a horizon of potentiality

571
00:58:03,760 --> 00:58:11,760
in other words hope excitement inclusion belonging on the other shunning people who act like haters

572
00:58:11,760 --> 00:58:17,200
that's why it's called anti lgbtq hate to disagree with them shunning haters who don't support and

573
00:58:17,200 --> 00:58:23,760
affirm them even if it's their own families is also increased over time to make sure the cult

574
00:58:23,760 --> 00:58:30,160
environment is the predominant influence in the victims lives that's what structuring the environment

575
00:58:30,160 --> 00:58:38,400
looks like as this process is repeated this is brainwashing it is thought reform it is not education

576
00:58:39,120 --> 00:58:46,720
when the in fact it's child abuse and it's happening at scale by demand in virtually every

577
00:58:46,720 --> 00:58:52,800
school system in the united states and in canada where it's actually worse what happens when these

578
00:58:52,800 --> 00:58:58,160
kids get committed enough to the cult when their emotional and social connection is so deep that

579
00:58:58,160 --> 00:59:03,760
they're that's who they are now that's who they know themselves to be in terms in terms of what's

580
00:59:03,840 --> 00:59:08,880
in terms of what's called psychosocial valuation well when the commitment is high enough a process

581
00:59:08,880 --> 00:59:14,720
of study begins that's when they're going to get introduced to the actual doctrine the more

582
00:59:14,720 --> 00:59:20,400
committed outer school members will start to learn the doctrine of the cult here they'd be

583
00:59:20,400 --> 00:59:26,480
studying queer theory in mal's prisons they would be studying Marxism and Leninism and socialism

584
00:59:27,360 --> 00:59:32,560
they're not just learning how to use pronouns or discover new ones they're not learning how to

585
00:59:32,560 --> 00:59:36,720
present themselves how to denounce everything against queer theory how to shut people out of

586
00:59:36,720 --> 00:59:41,280
their lives for disagreeing what the cult thinks is good for supporting people who are going through

587
00:59:41,280 --> 00:59:47,680
this process affirming blah blah blah cancels what's what's against them and affirm what is for them

588
00:59:47,680 --> 00:59:52,320
they're not just doing that they're also learning to defend that with pseudo-intellectual arguments

589
00:59:52,880 --> 00:59:58,960
based in queer theory they're learning to do a lot of queer activism which deepens their commitment

590
00:59:58,960 --> 01:00:04,000
every time you act on behalf of a set of beliefs you become more committed to those beliefs every

591
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:11,120
time you act in a commitment to a group you become more committed to the group why would you be doing

592
01:00:11,120 --> 01:00:16,560
any of this stuff which is unpopular and difficult i might even involve scary stuff like surgeries

593
01:00:16,560 --> 01:00:21,520
or standing up to your parents or throwing at your parents under the bus when you could be doing

594
01:00:21,520 --> 01:00:27,200
other things better things easier things unless you are really committed that's the psychology

595
01:00:27,680 --> 01:00:32,560
here and these people who are socially and emotionally dependent on a cult that has groomed

596
01:00:32,560 --> 01:00:38,240
them to be that way are then led to become intellectually committed to it and they form

597
01:00:38,240 --> 01:00:43,680
not an outer school of the cult but an inner school they are what we might call adapts not initiates

598
01:00:45,680 --> 01:00:50,960
most of the scholars the community organizers and the queer theory cult are in this tier most of

599
01:00:50,960 --> 01:00:56,000
the teachers that visit this upon kids by the way are not they're caught up in the outer school

600
01:00:56,080 --> 01:01:00,000
themselves they don't know the doctrine they don't they may not even like it they're just stuck

601
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:04,560
having to do it or going along with a current or they're just caught up by empathy which is we

602
01:01:04,560 --> 01:01:12,400
already heard a lie to push it on to people just in case the activists the consultants they definitely

603
01:01:12,400 --> 01:01:18,400
are the scholars they definitely are they know what they're doing there's another tier beyond this

604
01:01:18,400 --> 01:01:23,120
of course the so-called inner circle to cults members of the inner circle of a cult direct the

605
01:01:23,120 --> 01:01:28,960
cult and profit from the cult they might or might not believe in its doctrine depending on their

606
01:01:28,960 --> 01:01:33,600
motivations with queer theory undoubtedly some of the biggest organizers and financiers of the

607
01:01:33,600 --> 01:01:39,440
movement which primarily targets our children do not believe in it itself but fully believe in its

608
01:01:39,440 --> 01:01:46,720
destructive and disruptive potential on our society and our kids others do believe in the

609
01:01:46,720 --> 01:01:51,120
enormous amount of profit that's available from destroying lives and turning them into a permanent

610
01:01:51,120 --> 01:02:00,240
complicated medical or psychiatric patient others see political utility i don't think it's likely

611
01:02:00,240 --> 01:02:06,000
that much of the biden administration really believes queer theory but they see it as a political tool

612
01:02:07,120 --> 01:02:12,640
and they also see its capacity to build a permanently disaffected group with partially

613
01:02:12,640 --> 01:02:17,440
legitimate demands that will make for the rest of their lives against a system they hate that they

614
01:02:17,440 --> 01:02:23,520
can then pander to others see getting millions of people to participate in the cult and its affirmations

615
01:02:23,520 --> 01:02:28,640
is the way to affirm themselves and their own journeys think of the kind of big trans billionaires

616
01:02:28,640 --> 01:02:35,120
martin rothblatt the pritzkers and so on they shovel money into it so lots of kids will become

617
01:02:35,120 --> 01:02:41,040
trans so that society accepts trans so the society accepts them and that they were a trailblazer who

618
01:02:41,040 --> 01:02:48,080
made it happen that's their journey and it has to be affirmed so then they just happen to have

619
01:02:48,080 --> 01:02:52,400
billions of dollars to finance campaigns for mass affirmation there are lots of reasons why people

620
01:02:52,400 --> 01:02:57,680
at that tier of the cult might be involved and it's not always that they fully believe in it though

621
01:02:57,680 --> 01:03:03,600
it can sometimes be that the most important thing to remember about these different tiers of cults

622
01:03:03,600 --> 01:03:10,240
and the basic structure of cults and the guiding principles behind each is just that they exist

623
01:03:10,240 --> 01:03:14,240
that's the most important thing to realize the outer school are initiates they're seeking

624
01:03:15,040 --> 01:03:21,600
psychological and social reward through the cults manipulative offerings they're overwhelmingly the

625
01:03:21,600 --> 01:03:27,040
majority of the captured cultists the inner school seeks the same thing but more they have

626
01:03:27,040 --> 01:03:33,280
existential fervor tied to it in some degree that increases over time of intellectual immoral superiority

627
01:03:33,280 --> 01:03:38,480
because they know the doctrine the inner circle may or may not even know the doctrine they usually

628
01:03:38,480 --> 01:03:43,520
do but they don't always tends to be small in number and is ultimately using the whole cult

629
01:03:43,520 --> 01:03:47,520
to whatever its twisted purposes are which may not agree with one another in a case like this

630
01:03:48,080 --> 01:03:52,080
in the case of marxist cults the inner circle always uses the revolutionary cult of the era

631
01:03:52,080 --> 01:03:56,080
and then disposes of it when it's time to move on to the next phase of the revolution

632
01:03:56,080 --> 01:04:00,240
and i don't think that we should see anything different i think that these destabilizers

633
01:04:00,240 --> 01:04:06,000
that we see in queer activism are likely to be disposed of when they become a liability if the

634
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:09,680
revolution succeeds but they're really useful for tearing apart the society we have now

635
01:04:10,480 --> 01:04:14,880
by tearing apart families and children's lives and so much else

636
01:04:16,480 --> 01:04:20,800
so a little more on the environment about cults though because i think it's important to understand

637
01:04:20,800 --> 01:04:25,760
the environment in which cults transform their victims needs to be kind of looked at

638
01:04:25,760 --> 01:04:29,680
and nobody's done it in greater depth than robert lyfton robert j lyfton who studied the

639
01:04:29,680 --> 01:04:37,440
Maoist cult in detail as it was happening in the 1950s and he asserts that cults effectively take

640
01:04:37,440 --> 01:04:43,360
advantage of up to eight qualities that allows them to do thought reform on their populations

641
01:04:44,160 --> 01:04:48,560
queer theory as you'll see very obviously utilizes all eight of these and does so in

642
01:04:48,560 --> 01:04:55,440
sophisticated ways and so i'll talk about each one of these eight very briefly first there's

643
01:04:55,520 --> 01:05:00,640
melu control cults control the environment and make sure it only reflects cult doctrine

644
01:05:00,640 --> 01:05:05,440
this is why they cut people off from their friends or families uh any outside information

645
01:05:05,440 --> 01:05:09,760
and views that's all problematic it's harmful it's hurtful it's hate you can't look at it don't

646
01:05:09,760 --> 01:05:15,520
listen to james lindsay's podcast he's a hater he's lgbtq hate it's just gonna hurt your feelings

647
01:05:15,520 --> 01:05:21,680
it's so much transphobia you won't be able to stand it they keep you isolated in your melu from

648
01:05:21,680 --> 01:05:27,440
anything that might challenge or or break you free of cult doctrine so by the way if you happen

649
01:05:27,440 --> 01:05:31,200
to be imbibed in queer theory or you're kind of a queer theorist or you think you have a queer

650
01:05:31,200 --> 01:05:35,680
identity and you happen to be listening to this you're in a fucking cult now i'm just let me tell

651
01:05:35,680 --> 01:05:40,320
you just bluntly i use the bad word not because i lack words not because i'm missing vocabulary

652
01:05:40,320 --> 01:05:45,600
but to get your attention you are in a fucking cult and you are gonna you need to wake up it will

653
01:05:45,600 --> 01:05:51,280
your life will get better from the day you start getting away from this but anyway the melu control

654
01:05:51,280 --> 01:05:56,720
is all about like in our our world what we see is that it's using inclusion policies to ensure

655
01:05:56,720 --> 01:06:02,560
institutions and people only present cult agreeable views and affirmation and they remove anything

656
01:06:02,560 --> 01:06:07,040
that might cause doubt to the cult including people materials and so on aka cancel culture

657
01:06:08,240 --> 01:06:12,640
it is the immersive media and messaging that we get from all levels entertainment school

658
01:06:13,680 --> 01:06:19,520
politicians everything once you have melu control second lyfton says that you can then engage in

659
01:06:19,520 --> 01:06:24,560
something he calls mystical manipulation and i did a short bullet point episode of the podcast

660
01:06:24,560 --> 01:06:32,560
recently about that called plan spontaneity the lie of plan spontaneity cults he says create an

661
01:06:32,560 --> 01:06:39,520
appearance of total agreement mostly by silencing all disagreement and a sense of inevitability

662
01:06:39,520 --> 01:06:42,960
you might hear it kind of phrase this way there's a change coming and there's nothing you can do

663
01:06:42,960 --> 01:06:46,560
about it but you want to get on the right side of it because things will be good for you you might

664
01:06:46,560 --> 01:06:51,680
also hear it is who's on the right side of history there's a sense of total agreement all of society

665
01:06:51,680 --> 01:06:57,200
is going this way in inevitability history is moving this way there's also planned spontaneity

666
01:06:57,760 --> 01:07:03,600
which is organized protests and activism and activities that are made to look like they were

667
01:07:03,600 --> 01:07:07,840
spontaneous and organic because that gives the impression that the people are motivated to

668
01:07:07,840 --> 01:07:12,320
bring this into being and it also gives a sense of higher purpose like being on the right side of

669
01:07:12,320 --> 01:07:18,480
history and the point of mystical manipulation by a cult is in order to convince the victims

670
01:07:19,120 --> 01:07:26,560
of their power and influence the inevitability the total agreement of society it's just happening

671
01:07:26,560 --> 01:07:33,600
look there's so many people involved and they're working toward a better future it makes the

672
01:07:33,600 --> 01:07:40,080
cult appear more right and righteous to those captured by its spells think of the film the

673
01:07:40,080 --> 01:07:44,480
Truman show Jim character and Jim Carrey's character Truman was at the center of a huge

674
01:07:44,480 --> 01:07:49,680
operation of mystical manipulation if you want to understand what that looks like that was a totally

675
01:07:49,680 --> 01:07:56,320
controlled milieu third Lyfton says that within cult environments there is a demand for purity

676
01:07:56,320 --> 01:08:00,720
actually he says within ideological totalist environments which is to say cult environments

677
01:08:00,720 --> 01:08:06,240
there's a demand for purity cults are virtually always puritanical in their value systems they

678
01:08:06,320 --> 01:08:11,600
present their victims with stark contrasts of good and evil of right and wrong on virtually every

679
01:08:11,600 --> 01:08:16,400
issue and they demand purity with being on the right side of every issue and in fact they leverage

680
01:08:16,400 --> 01:08:21,360
that because you can't be you can't be perfectly pure so you keep this constant wheel of shame

681
01:08:21,360 --> 01:08:26,000
turning inside of you of guilt and shame and then you use that to pressure other people into

682
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:30,400
better compliance to cover up for your failures so that it's not you getting called out it's them

683
01:08:30,400 --> 01:08:37,200
instead first these dynamics manifest in dichotomies like pure versus impure absolutely good versus

684
01:08:37,200 --> 01:08:42,800
absolutely evil sacred versus profane or specifically in social justice cults like queer theory

685
01:08:42,800 --> 01:08:51,840
affirmation versus existential denial or care versus hate they're also interested at cults are if

686
01:08:51,840 --> 01:08:56,080
not obsessed with the binary of queer theory in particular with the binary of innocence versus

687
01:08:56,080 --> 01:09:02,960
initiation to various levels of standing within the cult including inclusion within the cult itself

688
01:09:02,960 --> 01:09:08,240
in the extreme this demand for purity sets up a dichotomy as stark as the people versus the enemies

689
01:09:08,240 --> 01:09:13,440
of the people the people support queer theory the enemies of the people are anti lgbtq hate who

690
01:09:13,440 --> 01:09:21,120
must be destroyed in the name of the queer people fourth he lists or he mentions what he calls a

691
01:09:21,120 --> 01:09:27,280
cult of confession that's based off of the demand for purity the demand for purity leads the cults

692
01:09:27,280 --> 01:09:33,360
victims to readily identify how they fall short of cult perfection leading them to both fear and

693
01:09:33,360 --> 01:09:40,240
desire to confess their failures and their evil ways that's the whole program confess recognize

694
01:09:40,240 --> 01:09:45,840
your crimes you have to confess look at the three body problem scene look at these other scenes of

695
01:09:45,840 --> 01:09:50,240
the cultural revolution that keep going viral now that people can kind of open their eyes and see

696
01:09:50,240 --> 01:09:56,320
what's happening that's what it's about a cult of confession confess how you are transphobic confess

697
01:09:56,320 --> 01:10:01,280
how you contribute to homophobia confess how you could do better cults often encourage this behavior

698
01:10:01,280 --> 01:10:06,000
to facilitate the trauma bonding process but they also do it to get you to recognize cult doctrine

699
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:12,320
and its application to your own life and situation and what paul frady calls your own existential

700
01:10:12,320 --> 01:10:18,800
situation the trauma bonding wheel of pain it's turned through pressuring people to confess say

701
01:10:18,800 --> 01:10:24,000
to homophobia or transphobia being a made up gender a made up sexuality or whatever and then

702
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:30,880
rewarding them what they do and punishing those that get accused of you know not being on board

703
01:10:31,600 --> 01:10:36,960
only later after they they say you know they after they do what they're supposed to do later you

704
01:10:36,960 --> 01:10:42,320
that it's a wheel of pain as I said you later indicate that their confession wasn't sufficient

705
01:10:42,320 --> 01:10:46,640
or sincere enough and you pull up some little detail where they fell short to point out that

706
01:10:46,640 --> 01:10:51,200
they didn't really mean it they're not really on board they still have internalized transphobia

707
01:10:51,200 --> 01:10:58,000
or whatever to initiate another round of struggle the melu control and demand for purity come together

708
01:10:58,000 --> 01:11:02,720
to create a uniquely exquisite psychological environment lyftons very clear about this

709
01:11:02,720 --> 01:11:07,760
in this environment almost everyone believes everyone else is pure while they themselves are

710
01:11:07,760 --> 01:11:15,680
not by the way if you search I actually did do a podcast about this chapter of lyfton specifically

711
01:11:15,680 --> 01:11:20,480
where I read I think the whole thing if not very close to it so you can go listen to lyftons full

712
01:11:20,480 --> 01:11:25,520
exposes exposition on this on new discourses and another podcast I'll think of the title

713
01:11:25,520 --> 01:11:30,240
scenario later but if you search go to the search bar and type in lyfton you can figure out which

714
01:11:30,240 --> 01:11:38,080
podcast is lyftons and I read the entire chapter of his book for for this topic but anyway sorry

715
01:11:38,080 --> 01:11:42,400
this is I was talking about the unique psychological environment an exquisite psychological environment

716
01:11:42,400 --> 01:11:47,360
created by melu control and demand for purity so you're in a completely controlled environment

717
01:11:47,360 --> 01:11:53,440
and your purity demands are high and you're being manipulated all the time mystical manipulation

718
01:11:53,440 --> 01:11:58,000
and what it results in is that almost everyone believes that everyone else is pure while they

719
01:11:58,000 --> 01:12:04,240
themselves are not think about that everyone you look around at is somehow a saint because

720
01:12:04,240 --> 01:12:08,320
everybody else got cancelled and thrown out by the way everyone else is a saint of the ideology

721
01:12:08,320 --> 01:12:13,120
but you nobody will tell how they are secretly transphobic nobody will come up it's like the

722
01:12:13,120 --> 01:12:20,080
time I had this young woman come up to me and the friend of the family and she came up and

723
01:12:20,080 --> 01:12:23,920
asked if she could talk to me because she knows my stance on these things and she said I want to

724
01:12:23,920 --> 01:12:27,360
talk to you because I know I can can tell you this and I have something I have to say and I was

725
01:12:27,360 --> 01:12:31,200
like what is it and she said I'm just done with the pronoun thing and she started crying because

726
01:12:31,200 --> 01:12:34,000
she didn't have anybody she could tell she was done with the pronoun thing she thought the pronoun

727
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:39,200
thing was ridiculous so she knew she had this inner sin against the trans doctrine or the

728
01:12:39,200 --> 01:12:45,840
queer theory doctrine that the pronoun rituals ridiculous and it's just demanding and it's

729
01:12:45,840 --> 01:12:50,160
compelled speech but she didn't feel like she could tell anybody that so she thought she alone

730
01:12:50,160 --> 01:12:56,160
among her she came to me to tell me because she thought she alone alone in the world completely

731
01:12:56,160 --> 01:13:02,880
isolated felt that way and she had to find some forbidden outsider to tell it to so the feeling

732
01:13:02,880 --> 01:13:08,560
is that you're the only one falling short even though sometimes you see your so-called classmates

733
01:13:08,560 --> 01:13:13,120
confessing to their own failures and then at that point you're like well at least it's not me and

734
01:13:13,120 --> 01:13:20,080
you join in the denouncing of them motivated by your own sense of hidden shame because you are

735
01:13:20,080 --> 01:13:25,040
led to feel like you are alone and that you alone have the deepest darkest failures against the

736
01:13:25,040 --> 01:13:30,800
cult doctrine which is impossible and the guilt and shame are so overwhelming that they fuel even

737
01:13:30,800 --> 01:13:37,360
more accusation and criticism and confession which is self-criticism just by virtue of how

738
01:13:37,360 --> 01:13:42,080
they make you feel and that is the part of the environment the cult environment that does the

739
01:13:42,080 --> 01:13:48,320
bulk of the indoctrination or brainwashing or thought reform work what is it brainwashing you

740
01:13:48,320 --> 01:13:54,960
into well fifth lift and describes what he calls that all cults have at the center or all ideological

741
01:13:54,960 --> 01:14:00,640
totalist environments have at the center a sacred science so at the heart of every cult is what

742
01:14:00,640 --> 01:14:07,360
lyfton refers to as a sacred science that is infallible people can and do fail it all the time

743
01:14:07,360 --> 01:14:14,480
but the doctrine itself cannot fail you've probably heard that before it's in this case it would be

744
01:14:14,480 --> 01:14:19,280
queer theory cannot fail but people can fail queer theory and people are being brainwashed

745
01:14:19,280 --> 01:14:25,440
into that sacred science the point of the cult of confession is to create a dynamic that forces

746
01:14:25,440 --> 01:14:29,840
people to confess their failure to understand internalize and act and even embody the sacred

747
01:14:29,840 --> 01:14:34,880
science the point of kevin kumashiro's leading people into emotional crisis and structuring

748
01:14:34,880 --> 01:14:40,560
the environment around them so they resolve it productively is to lead them to internalize

749
01:14:40,560 --> 01:14:46,320
and act and even embody the sacred science all while accusing others of their failings as much

750
01:14:46,320 --> 01:14:53,360
and often as possible in the name of helping them in the same way the point of the confession is to

751
01:14:53,360 --> 01:14:58,960
get people to willingly adopt the lens of the sacred science in this case queer theory so that

752
01:14:58,960 --> 01:15:05,600
they can learn to quote recognize their crimes against the sacred science and the society aka

753
01:15:05,600 --> 01:15:12,560
cult that supports it and to pledge to do better pledging to do better means ideologically remolding

754
01:15:12,560 --> 01:15:19,200
yourself to use mouths words for it and here queer theory is given as the sacred science the

755
01:15:19,200 --> 01:15:23,920
one true correct understanding of sex gender sexuality and all the normal features of society

756
01:15:23,920 --> 01:15:28,560
and its definitions of what is and is not legitimate it is more than we're going to cover today but

757
01:15:28,560 --> 01:15:34,560
it's a critical constructivist ideology of sex gender and sexuality which believes is sex gender

758
01:15:34,560 --> 01:15:39,280
and sexuality are ultimately socially constructed phenomena that are the products of dominant power

759
01:15:39,280 --> 01:15:45,520
that imprison people in a life that is structured by the power dynamics of society and it is their

760
01:15:45,520 --> 01:15:54,640
obligation to wake up to that fact and to denounce all norms and legitimacy in order to try to overthrow

761
01:15:54,640 --> 01:16:04,080
that system sixth lyfton calls it doctrine over person cults place doctrine over people if we

762
01:16:04,080 --> 01:16:08,960
quote from hegel as i like to do at times like this history uses people and then discards them

763
01:16:10,400 --> 01:16:17,360
the person isn't even a person in the eyes of the cult if they don't hold to and enact the doctrine

764
01:16:17,920 --> 01:16:24,080
as mal said not to have correct political opinions is like not having a soul

765
01:16:25,600 --> 01:16:30,400
i don't really need to elaborate on how doctrine operates over people you're not really a person

766
01:16:30,400 --> 01:16:35,920
and you can't be associated with unless you are involved in and support the doctrine seventh

767
01:16:37,440 --> 01:16:42,560
lyfton lo calls it loading the language do i have to describe how queer theory loads the

768
01:16:42,560 --> 01:16:46,880
language all the words mean more than one things everything's got an agenda tucked in it

769
01:16:46,880 --> 01:16:53,840
we're all very familiar with the language stuff now inclusion belonging diversity hate this is all

770
01:16:53,840 --> 01:16:59,280
heavily loaded language that all advances the acceptance and spread of the agenda of the cult

771
01:16:59,280 --> 01:17:06,160
and keeps people locked into it and eighth lyfton says the last characteristic of cults is dispensing

772
01:17:06,160 --> 01:17:10,640
of existence and he says at the deepest level i'm not quoting him here i'm paraphrasing him

773
01:17:10,640 --> 01:17:18,000
the cult decides whose existence counts and whose doesn't the punchline of this is that those who

774
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:23,280
accept the cult doctrine which is the sacred science and its application are considered people

775
01:17:23,280 --> 01:17:29,840
and no one else is it's like they don't have a soul my is what mal said only the doctrine

776
01:17:29,840 --> 01:17:36,400
nearly legitimate are allowed to exist at least in a spiritual sense everyone else is some kind of a

777
01:17:36,400 --> 01:17:43,600
fallen deplorable hater effectively enemies and non people which justifies their abuse

778
01:17:43,600 --> 01:17:48,400
their disenfranchisement their silencing cutting them out of your life even if they're your parents

779
01:17:48,400 --> 01:17:54,000
and so on that's a cult environment and queer theory as you can see very easily satisfies

780
01:17:54,000 --> 01:18:00,480
all of that just kind of for fun um the standard iron law of woke projection of course always applies

781
01:18:00,480 --> 01:18:05,280
because it never misses and the dispensing of existence aspect of the cult environment says

782
01:18:05,280 --> 01:18:09,760
kind of why woke activists always say everything is denying their existence or a genocide you know

783
01:18:09,760 --> 01:18:14,880
they always say oh you deny our existence unless you give us gender affirming care uh it's a trans

784
01:18:14,880 --> 01:18:18,880
genocide they're projecting what's happening is they're projecting it's the iron law of woke

785
01:18:18,880 --> 01:18:23,760
projection their belief is that you don't have a right to exist if your beliefs quote unquote

786
01:18:23,760 --> 01:18:29,040
deny their right to exist which is in quotes because you aren't denying their right to exist

787
01:18:29,040 --> 01:18:33,920
you're denying their political identity which isn't even a real identity in queer theory this

788
01:18:33,920 --> 01:18:40,160
means if you don't affirm their embodied political activism against everything legitimate and normal

789
01:18:40,160 --> 01:18:45,200
then you're denying their existence it's like how they have fat studies people which took this idea

790
01:18:45,200 --> 01:18:51,120
from queer theory by the way say that if you were to encourage weight loss programs and fitness and

791
01:18:51,120 --> 01:18:56,720
eating better and losing weight um that what you would do is a fat genocide because if all the people

792
01:18:56,720 --> 01:19:00,240
lost weight and there are no fat people there would be no fat culture and so you've committed a fat

793
01:19:00,240 --> 01:19:03,920
genocide by getting rid of all the fat people and you say well we didn't get rid of anybody and

794
01:19:03,920 --> 01:19:08,640
they say well there's no fat people so you get rid of fat people um and you think i'm making it up

795
01:19:08,640 --> 01:19:15,120
but that's how they think and um because you are apparently willing to do a genocide of that kind

796
01:19:15,120 --> 01:19:20,320
or a cultural genocide you're therefore beyond the pale of humanity and do not deserve to exist

797
01:19:20,320 --> 01:19:25,680
that's actually the cult's logic and that's the logic of all totalitarian genocides that's it

798
01:19:26,320 --> 01:19:30,320
the people who you know we have we have a communist utopia on the other side we have a queer

799
01:19:30,320 --> 01:19:36,480
horizon of possibility and potentiality but transphobes and selfish capitalists and so on

800
01:19:36,480 --> 01:19:40,880
won't let us have it so we've got to get rid of them we would already have communism socialism

801
01:19:40,880 --> 01:19:45,040
would already be working great we would already have a communist utopia but some people are selfish

802
01:19:45,040 --> 01:19:50,160
and won't won't give up their private property so let's just go seize their farms and get the

803
01:19:50,160 --> 01:19:54,800
program going we could open our society back up you know if if everybody would just get their

804
01:19:54,800 --> 01:19:59,040
vaccines if everybody would just 100% of everybody just got all their shots then we could just get

805
01:19:59,040 --> 01:20:05,760
our economy back same logic all totalitarian genocides come from this darkest piece of cult

806
01:20:05,760 --> 01:20:10,720
logic we could go a lot deeper into the nature of the queer theory cult and how it's a cult in this

807
01:20:10,720 --> 01:20:15,920
i'm sure i will in future podcasts i'm not going to drag it out um i'm not going to get into the

808
01:20:15,920 --> 01:20:21,120
whole gnostic hermetic conception of the world with normal society acting like a evil spirit

809
01:20:21,120 --> 01:20:26,720
that imprisons everyone into performing a fake persona for the world that's gender performativity

810
01:20:26,720 --> 01:20:30,720
so they can never be liberated to be who they truly are i've done that at length in other

811
01:20:30,720 --> 01:20:34,240
podcasts i'll probably do it again i think there's one actually called queer theory is queer

812
01:20:34,240 --> 01:20:37,680
narcissism or something you should go listen to that should also read the querying of the american

813
01:20:37,680 --> 01:20:45,040
child where we cover this in tremendous depth um that would get us into talking about judith butler

814
01:20:45,040 --> 01:20:52,160
when a queer theory's uh founding mothers i suppose fathers i mean whatever and her belief

815
01:20:52,160 --> 01:20:57,680
that gender and sex aren't actually real but her performances we already talked about that um we learned

816
01:20:58,320 --> 01:21:05,040
repeat those performances in order to satisfy normal society which is now acting like a

817
01:21:05,040 --> 01:21:10,400
gnostic demiurge her whole body of work could be summarized like i said before in the six words

818
01:21:10,400 --> 01:21:14,640
drag is life and life is drag so everybody's always doing drag and everything that they do

819
01:21:14,640 --> 01:21:19,760
whether they realize it or not because society writes the scripts for how we do drag which is

820
01:21:19,760 --> 01:21:26,320
usually cis hetero um and that we just do that and in her language borrowing from foucault she says

821
01:21:26,320 --> 01:21:32,480
that imprisons their souls which they then have to script physically on that's her word script

822
01:21:32,480 --> 01:21:37,840
them physically onto their body or inscribe onto their body and script into the society through

823
01:21:37,840 --> 01:21:43,840
their bodies by performing gender and becoming aware of this doingness of gender maybe one day

824
01:21:43,840 --> 01:21:49,040
already doing gender as a podcast as a paper that gets it's super influential that gets overlooked

825
01:21:49,040 --> 01:21:54,400
a lot um but being coming out for judith butler becoming aware of the doingness of gender and

826
01:21:54,400 --> 01:21:58,800
even sex and sexuality opens the door to that queer horizon of possibilities beyond the norm

827
01:22:00,560 --> 01:22:06,800
she got those ideas in turn from michelle foucault we already talked about him

828
01:22:07,280 --> 01:22:13,920
uh also from uh the radical feminism she was embedded in which would be Simone de Beauvoir

829
01:22:16,560 --> 01:22:19,760
we could get really deep into that we've kind of done it before uh

830
01:22:23,120 --> 01:22:29,280
what do i want to say here um the idea though is that you know society forces you to imprison

831
01:22:29,280 --> 01:22:36,320
yourself uh in a gender performance or a mode of presentation and that you can break free of

832
01:22:36,320 --> 01:22:42,640
that prison by understanding it um we're not going to get into the whole john money side of things

833
01:22:42,640 --> 01:22:47,920
and stroller and greenson and the idea of gender identity that's another podcast for another day

834
01:22:47,920 --> 01:22:54,000
but it it's basically what they did is kind of discombobulated the idea of who we are

835
01:22:54,000 --> 01:23:01,440
by misusing the synonym for sex that is gender um initially likely as a synonym but then by

836
01:23:01,440 --> 01:23:06,000
divorcing it from sex entirely that's its own story we're not going to get into the

837
01:23:06,000 --> 01:23:11,280
i mean i did a podcast on this feminist something about feminist nosticism you can look it up

838
01:23:11,280 --> 01:23:16,640
where i talk about uh Simone de Beauvoir and the pressing question of what is a woman

839
01:23:16,640 --> 01:23:22,880
one is not born but becomes woman she said and her point was the same as foucault's about homosexuals

840
01:23:22,880 --> 01:23:27,520
what does it mean to be a woman when no one else in particular society and patriarchy

841
01:23:28,160 --> 01:23:35,200
get to tell you what it means to be a woman uh or for foucault a homosexual which

842
01:23:35,200 --> 01:23:41,520
Halprin says means queer so in short we really could summarize this as a reconceptualization

843
01:23:41,520 --> 01:23:46,880
of what i call social nosticism in which we are imprisoned by the features of our social reality

844
01:23:46,880 --> 01:23:52,640
but can escape at least socio-spiritually with the right hidden insights about who we really are

845
01:23:52,640 --> 01:23:58,320
and into what world we have been flung or thrown that's a hadegra reference if you don't know it

846
01:23:58,320 --> 01:24:03,760
and that um by doing so that we might actually achieve liberation or emancipation that's why

847
01:24:03,760 --> 01:24:10,800
their language is this way um this is a transformative social nosticism that reconceives

848
01:24:10,800 --> 01:24:19,120
of the uh mysticism of earlier ages um that's a lot to get into about how characters such as

849
01:24:19,120 --> 01:24:26,240
rousseau and hagel and marx preceding bivouar foucault and butler or even swedenborg and

850
01:24:27,120 --> 01:24:34,640
jakaboma and some of these other characters maybe viko geambattista viko and some others all led

851
01:24:34,640 --> 01:24:40,480
to this um social alchemy as described by the way and you should listen to my george soros podcast

852
01:24:40,480 --> 01:24:46,320
about social alchemy but with queer theory and queer education in particular and social justice

853
01:24:46,320 --> 01:24:51,440
education more broadly one of its primary laboratories for this mysticism is our children

854
01:24:51,440 --> 01:24:56,240
and we should be really upset but we also should ask the question why children why does queer

855
01:24:56,240 --> 01:25:01,680
theory target kids why is it so interested in children which is one of the characteristics

856
01:25:01,680 --> 01:25:06,240
that i gave remember i said queer theory is the doctrine of a religious cult that cult is based

857
01:25:06,240 --> 01:25:12,560
on sex it is little or nothing to do with gay people and it primarily targets children well

858
01:25:12,560 --> 01:25:19,760
four reasons really first children are in schools typically and even with their entertainment uh

859
01:25:19,760 --> 01:25:24,800
they are a captive environment captive audience in schools they have to go to school for 30 35

860
01:25:24,800 --> 01:25:30,800
hours a week even if unless they're very strictly monitored in homeschooling the curriculum standards

861
01:25:30,800 --> 01:25:35,760
are usually including this and so they're a captive audience second children have not achieved the

862
01:25:35,760 --> 01:25:40,960
necessary cortical development in their brains to distinguish reality from fantasy so the

863
01:25:40,960 --> 01:25:46,320
mystifications of queer theory can be considered plausible to them where adults would be less

864
01:25:46,320 --> 01:25:52,080
interested third children are going through the developmental process processes i should say of

865
01:25:52,080 --> 01:25:58,560
identity formation and puberty which need to be hijacked for this ideology to take firm root

866
01:25:59,360 --> 01:26:04,320
just it's so tumultuous to grow up but you are also literally going through the process of figuring

867
01:26:04,320 --> 01:26:10,560
out who you are which is a whole thing and they have to take advantage of that in order to get

868
01:26:10,560 --> 01:26:14,560
queer theory to really take root but finally children become and this is really important from

869
01:26:14,560 --> 01:26:18,720
the marxist perspective that queer theory is queer marxism again read queering of the american

870
01:26:18,720 --> 01:26:23,840
child and really get your head around this it's important but children become a gateway into

871
01:26:23,840 --> 01:26:30,960
families and they become a wedge into not just families but also other targets families faiths

872
01:26:30,960 --> 01:26:37,360
and any institutions they grow up to become a part of they have to have a bottom up demand

873
01:26:37,360 --> 01:26:42,320
that they're trying to force into our kids through brainwashing them at school to demand

874
01:26:42,320 --> 01:26:48,880
the inclusive policies so they can have the ability to install them by what looks like

875
01:26:48,880 --> 01:26:54,560
dint of demand rather than totalitarian top-down force that's how they're trying to get around that

876
01:26:55,680 --> 01:26:59,920
okay so now we can summarize what is queer theory it's a doctrine of religious cult the

877
01:26:59,920 --> 01:27:04,080
cult is primarily sex-based it predominantly targets children it has little nothing to do

878
01:27:04,080 --> 01:27:10,240
with being gay and what can we do about it well normally we would turn to our institutions and

879
01:27:10,240 --> 01:27:15,520
ask them to see the light and step in but we can't do that this isn't working our institutions are

880
01:27:15,520 --> 01:27:19,440
actually captured our medical institutions or educational institutions or government institutions

881
01:27:19,440 --> 01:27:25,600
or entertainment institutions or media institutions they're captured we face a problem of captured

882
01:27:25,600 --> 01:27:30,480
institutions there's a like to phrase it now ideologically contaminated institutions our

883
01:27:30,480 --> 01:27:36,400
institutions accept and promote queer theory all the way up to the white house we therefore cannot

884
01:27:36,400 --> 01:27:41,600
count on our institutions educational psychological medical governmental anything to help us here

885
01:27:41,600 --> 01:27:47,680
they're all captured what do we do they are part of the controlled melu in lyfton's language

886
01:27:47,680 --> 01:27:52,560
they are creating the mystical manipulation they are peddling the sacred science of queer theory

887
01:27:52,560 --> 01:27:58,080
they are in short the center of the problem so what's this like here's an analogy it's like

888
01:27:58,080 --> 01:28:03,200
being a pilot and you're flying the plane and imagine all your instruments go out right so

889
01:28:03,200 --> 01:28:09,840
you're flying the plane you're you're a pilot and everything goes out on the aircraft right no

890
01:28:09,840 --> 01:28:15,360
navigation computer no altimeter nothing what do you have to do that's us we have our institutions

891
01:28:15,360 --> 01:28:20,560
are like our our instruments what do you have to do if you're that pilot because this tells us

892
01:28:20,560 --> 01:28:24,800
what we're going to do so imagine picture yourself in the cockpit you're flying a plane

893
01:28:25,760 --> 01:28:30,160
and all you're in the air and all of a sudden all your instruments go out what do you have to do

894
01:28:31,040 --> 01:28:38,400
you have to fly the plane safely mechanically and find a runway and land you don't get to rely on

895
01:28:38,400 --> 01:28:42,320
your instruments because you don't have them like i said no navigation computer no altimeter

896
01:28:42,960 --> 01:28:49,200
no speedometer nothing you have you you have your experience you have your wits and you're

897
01:28:49,200 --> 01:28:53,520
hopefully the weather is good and you have enough ability to see what's in front of you to do the

898
01:28:53,520 --> 01:28:58,320
right thing that's all you get that's like us our institutions are like the instruments in that

899
01:28:58,320 --> 01:29:02,560
cockpit but for society not for an airplane and right now they're putting out all the wrong

900
01:29:02,560 --> 01:29:08,640
information consistently they will not help us find a runway or land the plane safely and if we

901
01:29:08,640 --> 01:29:13,440
take the plane analogy seriously our lives and the lives of everybody in the plane aka our society

902
01:29:13,440 --> 01:29:19,120
depend on us doing this so what would we do in that situation we would use our senses we would

903
01:29:19,120 --> 01:29:25,680
trust our eyes and ears in other words we would use our senses directly to look for the runway to

904
01:29:25,680 --> 01:29:31,680
line up lower the plane land it and slow down and stop we wouldn't be looking to the broken

905
01:29:31,680 --> 01:29:36,480
instruments at all we wouldn't be looking off into space we would look at reality around us and

906
01:29:36,480 --> 01:29:42,000
navigate without the instruments as the intermediary and that's what we need to start finding ways to do

907
01:29:42,000 --> 01:29:47,120
now at the societal level one individual at a time we need to start figuring out how to look

908
01:29:47,120 --> 01:29:54,480
around us assess what's really going on and make smart judicious action where if we or if

909
01:29:54,480 --> 01:29:58,960
we're rash if you just jerk the wheel or pull the throttle or whatever you're still going to crash

910
01:29:58,960 --> 01:30:04,320
and everything's going to go bad we have to make smart decisions that take into account reality

911
01:30:05,440 --> 01:30:10,800
individually what does that mean what do you do well what you start with is the truth not some

912
01:30:10,800 --> 01:30:15,280
mediated truth peddled by these corrupt institutions but the plain simple truth the kind that you

913
01:30:15,280 --> 01:30:20,000
can see with your eyes and experience and everybody knows like that there are two sexes that people

914
01:30:20,000 --> 01:30:26,080
can't change sex that most people are straight that gay happens we don't know why that's fine

915
01:30:26,080 --> 01:30:30,880
queer is not an identity it's a defiant political stance we don't have to tolerate or accommodate

916
01:30:30,880 --> 01:30:35,280
how can you know that one with your own senses because it's in the fucking book defining it guys

917
01:30:35,280 --> 01:30:40,000
it's in black and white they wrote it down themselves so if they tell you that you have that

918
01:30:40,000 --> 01:30:44,880
information so if someone claims to have an identity or sexuality that requires an explanation

919
01:30:44,880 --> 01:30:50,400
to put it simply it's fake that's that's common sense right if somebody claims to have an identity

920
01:30:50,400 --> 01:30:54,400
or sexuality that requires an explanation it's fake and doesn't demand our respect

921
01:30:54,960 --> 01:30:59,280
we don't have to respect this we have to be nice we're not nice we have to be

922
01:31:01,760 --> 01:31:06,880
human to people we have to realize that the people in this cult are people in a cult

923
01:31:06,880 --> 01:31:12,080
and they need help they need deprogramming they need therefore patience and compassion

924
01:31:12,080 --> 01:31:17,280
and a landing pad and lots of things but we also have to recognize that there's a lot of predatory

925
01:31:17,280 --> 01:31:22,560
behavior happening and predator predatory behavior of any kind in any place is not something that we

926
01:31:22,560 --> 01:31:27,920
have to support or enable perversion outside of the confines if you want to call it this

927
01:31:27,920 --> 01:31:33,200
of consenting adults acting in private does not deserve our tolerance and shouldn't be given it

928
01:31:34,080 --> 01:31:38,000
our schools should not be doing any of this our schools should not be pushing

929
01:31:38,640 --> 01:31:43,200
our kids into emotional crisis and then resolving it productively that's child abuse

930
01:31:44,080 --> 01:31:48,800
our schools should not be putting pornography in front of our children whether it's in class

931
01:31:48,800 --> 01:31:55,280
or through their libraries or through the curriculum through any various tricks and children do not

932
01:31:55,280 --> 01:32:00,560
benefit from its presence there enough of this this is the kind of stuff is that you can start to

933
01:32:00,560 --> 01:32:04,240
first recognize get your bearings if you're in that plane you've got to figure out what the

934
01:32:04,240 --> 01:32:07,840
heck's going on you've got to get your bearings for yourself that's what i'm talking about wait a

935
01:32:07,840 --> 01:32:13,200
minute porn in the schools what the hell what push kids into an emotional crisis and resolve it

936
01:32:13,200 --> 01:32:17,760
according to our doctrine that's a problem what are you going to do you've got to assess what's

937
01:32:17,760 --> 01:32:22,320
going on you've got to stop listening to the to the gas lighting in the bs and get your head on

938
01:32:22,320 --> 01:32:27,840
straight you've got a plane to land and you don't have instruments in fact you have worse no

939
01:32:27,840 --> 01:32:34,080
instruments you have lying instruments and with the where that is is in the truth so you've

940
01:32:34,080 --> 01:32:40,160
got to look for the truth and you really have to look for it and you have to tell other people it

941
01:32:40,160 --> 01:32:43,200
what i say a lot and you've heard this before i did a podcast on this is that you have to love the

942
01:32:43,200 --> 01:32:47,360
truth i kind of riff from the bible you have to love the truth with all your heart and all your

943
01:32:47,360 --> 01:32:51,760
mind and all your soul and all your strength and you have to love your neighbor enough to tell your

944
01:32:51,760 --> 01:32:58,560
neighbor the truth as you would have him tell you the truth these are basic commandments this is

945
01:32:58,560 --> 01:33:04,400
this this is how it sounds like that's not enough it's everything at the beginning and then you put

946
01:33:04,400 --> 01:33:10,320
that into practice and you can fix the world but you really do have to love the truth because if

947
01:33:10,320 --> 01:33:14,720
you love the truth you'll say it you won't care if they call you transphobic you'll seek it you'll

948
01:33:14,720 --> 01:33:20,240
read these awful books you'll defend it when you get under attack or somebody else says you'll defend

949
01:33:20,240 --> 01:33:24,640
other people who are saying it you'll support them you'll back them up you have to love the truth

950
01:33:24,640 --> 01:33:28,400
because if you don't eventually the splc is going to write an article about you and you're going to

951
01:33:28,400 --> 01:33:33,360
back off you'll buckle they're going to threaten to take something away from you or your kids that

952
01:33:33,360 --> 01:33:38,560
you can't bear and you'll buckle and you'll get pulled into this caring affirming nonsense

953
01:33:40,400 --> 01:33:44,000
but the fact of the matter is that there's no caring and there's no affirmation that isn't

954
01:33:44,000 --> 01:33:48,080
first built on the truth so you're going to have to love the truth and you're going to have to

955
01:33:48,080 --> 01:33:54,320
to push it and defend it and help other people do it in tough situations there's no other way

956
01:33:54,960 --> 01:34:00,320
and every time you tell a lie just remember this every time you tell a lie to to be nice or to fit

957
01:34:00,320 --> 01:34:04,960
in the pronoun game or whatever you're selling a piece of your soul so you have to stop doing that

958
01:34:05,600 --> 01:34:10,560
and that's what it means really to love the truth and if you start there telling the truth that's

959
01:34:10,560 --> 01:34:14,320
what solzhenichin said is that if you tell the truth one man telling the truth can bring down a

960
01:34:14,320 --> 01:34:18,880
regime it starts a ripple effect one person telling the truth is a lot becomes a lot of people

961
01:34:18,880 --> 01:34:23,200
telling the truth facts start to come out then there's more things to tell the w path files come out

962
01:34:23,200 --> 01:34:27,760
next thing you know this entire medical monstrosity starts to crumble out from under and you say well

963
01:34:27,760 --> 01:34:31,760
we can't get the law to go along this we can't get the courts to agree with us keep fighting because

964
01:34:31,760 --> 01:34:36,160
day by day by day something else comes out keep digging somebody had to go look up what's going

965
01:34:36,160 --> 01:34:42,000
on at w path whether it's me a hues or whoever digging into it um there's other revelations

966
01:34:42,000 --> 01:34:46,960
i guess i do no harm just release them the daily color just release them somebody's digging into

967
01:34:46,960 --> 01:34:51,920
it so start digging get curious ask questions read the materials figure out who's funding it

968
01:34:51,920 --> 01:34:56,720
whatever happens to be and then report on it and when you do these things which is what it means

969
01:34:56,720 --> 01:35:01,680
to be based by the way you break the melu control and you can start to break apart the cult you also

970
01:35:01,680 --> 01:35:09,280
need to protect your kids obviously um to keep them out of the controlled melu uh into one that

971
01:35:09,360 --> 01:35:13,120
you children are supposed to be in a sheltered melu and the parents are in charge of that

972
01:35:13,120 --> 01:35:18,080
sheltering um you also when you do these things you tell the truth you seek the truth you fight

973
01:35:18,080 --> 01:35:23,760
for the truth you defend the truth every day you don't just break melu control you but you break

974
01:35:23,760 --> 01:35:28,800
apart mystical manipulation they can't trick you if they end up doing this huge stage demonstrate

975
01:35:28,800 --> 01:35:34,160
demonstration and you say that's planned spontaneity and it's fake it makes it lose its magical power

976
01:35:35,120 --> 01:35:42,000
you by doing this cast doubt upon the so-called sacred science gender ideology starts looking

977
01:35:42,000 --> 01:35:47,120
not just even incorrect but ridiculous and the more people who think it's ridiculous the more

978
01:35:47,120 --> 01:35:51,840
people who will either loudly or quietly walk away from it what happens when you start doing this

979
01:35:51,840 --> 01:35:56,320
and start doing it consistently and start doing it every day like billboard chris showing up one

980
01:35:56,320 --> 01:36:01,600
conversation at a time getting clear on his pursuing the information getting clear getting out there

981
01:36:01,600 --> 01:36:07,360
and talking to people as you start to break those cycles of abuse you break the cult of confession

982
01:36:07,360 --> 01:36:11,440
you tell people that it's okay to trust their eyes and their ears and even their gut intuition

983
01:36:11,440 --> 01:36:16,800
and to believe in common sense again and to understand therefore very clearly that what

984
01:36:16,800 --> 01:36:21,760
they are experiencing and seeing in queer theory is abusive and manipulative because queer theory

985
01:36:21,760 --> 01:36:26,320
is the doctrine as i said of a cult religion that is based on sex that primarily targets

986
01:36:26,320 --> 01:36:32,000
their children has very little to do nothing to do really with being gay it's hostile in fact to

987
01:36:32,000 --> 01:36:38,480
gay interests in every regard if we might use this phrase gay interests and so it's our necessary

988
01:36:38,480 --> 01:36:43,760
responsibility to learn as much about it as we can both in theory and in practice and to

989
01:36:43,760 --> 01:36:50,800
tell people about it and oppose it um like i said you can read a lot of what i had to say here

990
01:36:50,800 --> 01:36:55,680
in my book with logan lansing it's his book really that i helped with called the querying of the american

991
01:36:55,680 --> 01:37:02,800
child um i hope this was a informative episode it was a lot longer than i meant um i gave this

992
01:37:02,800 --> 01:37:08,800
talk at pit in like 45 minutes and here we are at almost an hour and 40 but i hope you'll forgive me

993
01:37:09,680 --> 01:37:15,600
more to come soon i've got more horrifying un documents and other things coming so thank

994
01:37:15,600 --> 01:37:31,520
you for listening and i'll catch you in the next one

995
01:37:45,600 --> 01:37:47,060
you
