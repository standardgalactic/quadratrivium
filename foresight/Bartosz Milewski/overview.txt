Checking Bartosz Milewski/Category Theory 1.2： What is a category？.txt
1. **Identity Function**: Every set has an identity function, which maps each element of the set to itself without changing anything. This is a fundamental concept in both set theory and category theory.

2. **Category Theory**: This abstracts away the details of what the sets are and focuses on how functions (morphisms) between these sets interact. The composition of morphisms is associative, which forms the basis of a category.

3. **Composition Table and Axioms**: In a category, the composition of morphisms is associative, fulfilling the axioms of a category. This allows us to study the relationships between objects without concern for their internal structure.

4. **Forgetting Information**: By abstracting away the details of what's inside the sets and what the functions do, we can focus on the morphisms themselves, treating them like commands or operations without specific implementations.

5. **Identifying Properties**: Using category theory, one can identify properties of sets, such as an empty set or a single-element set, solely based on the morphisms connecting them to other sets. This is a higher level, more abstract way of understanding structures.

6. **Data Hiding and Abstraction**: Category theory exemplifies data hiding and abstraction by focusing on the interface (morphisms) rather than the internal implementation (elements and functions). This leads to a highly abstract language for describing and manipulating mathematical structures.

7. **The End of Abstraction**: The concept of category theory represents the pinnacle of abstraction and data hiding, where the essence of an object is captured by its relationships with other objects in the category rather than its intrinsic properties or contents.

In summary, category theory provides a powerful framework for abstracting the study of mathematical structures, focusing on morphisms and their compositions to understand the properties and relationships between different sets, without needing to know what's inside those sets. This is the ultimate level of data hiding and abstraction in mathematics.
