0	4000	I am the Contrary and this is my world.
12000	17000	Hi, my name is Shivam Vezhan. I'm here to take on Rajiv Makhani on his bizarre idea
17000	21000	that social media alienates people rather than brings them together.
31000	34000	You can't see how the man should have followed the pictures.
34000	38000	Technology is a strange beast. It comes bearing gifts with one hand
38000	41000	and it will always stab you in the back with the other.
41000	45000	Now that was supposed to be the cliché saying, every time something in the world of technology
45000	50000	truly takes off, there are many people that will be there to make sure they pull it down.
50000	54000	Is it because it's such an easy hit? Is it because it really paints a big bull's eye
54000	58000	and what's happening with these 20 million people that seem to be resonating
58000	61000	with this Gary Turk guy in the look-up video?
61000	68000	Alright, so we have you here. We've all set to find out from you as to why this is something that keeps coming up.
68000	73000	Our viewpoint is that while it is a cliché at one time, it's made a huge comeback,
73000	76000	not just because it's a video and the 20 million people that watched it,
76000	82000	but because true sense is starting to now dawn on people that using technology all the time
82000	87000	as their primary form of communication could be a serious recipe for disaster.
87000	92000	You obviously don't really believe in that, so a minute, minute and a half all yours to tell me why we're wrong.
92000	96000	Well, you could make a case of social media addictive and you might take it for real-time interaction,
96000	101000	but sooner or later everybody makes friends on social media with particular overlapping interests
101000	103000	and then they decide to meet in person.
103000	107000	Now, I'm meeting you for the first time here, but I might go and add you on Facebook.
107000	110000	I don't even need to go home. I can add you on Facebook right here on my phone.
110000	116000	So many of us who use social media for years, be it in the blogging boom or Twitter, Facebook
116000	122000	or e-groups which are now forgotten, I have made online friends into real-life friends, met them.
122000	126000	You even forget. You become so close that you even forget that you met through Facebook once upon a time.
126000	129000	So I don't think this binary really exists.
129000	133000	That video shows people hurling into a room, but actually now with smartphones,
133000	138000	you're not clustered in a room at all. You're mobile everywhere.
138000	143000	So you're saying that for generations with the way even the human evolution has happened,
143000	148000	which is face-to-face, which is direct eye contact, which is actually a little touch
148000	155000	and everything else that's been the general guards of everything that we've done with evolution,
155000	159000	the pillar blocks of how we all evolved. You're saying it doesn't really matter.
159000	163000	We can move to this new system and there will be absolutely no ripple effect of it.
163000	167000	No, it matters. I'm not saying that everybody should stop meeting each other in sort of person,
167000	173000	but what I'm saying is that this eye contact for instance in person is replicated on the internet
173000	176000	with its own language. Emoticons, for instance, do that.
176000	182000	When you're seeing something sarcastically in your smiley, that smiley is basically replicating the smiley.
182000	188000	This reminds me of the fact that the first time smileys became a big hit,
188000	193000	it was because you kind of thought, okay, was that a little harsh? Let me put a smiley at the back.
193000	197000	So it doesn't actually lead to a lot of contrary viewpoints.
197000	202000	So if I sat here and spoke with you and my level of harshness and sarcasm,
202000	207000	because you're with me, would be far more muted because I would give you some respect.
207000	212000	That respect is usually lost out there because I can just camouflage by using an emoticon.
212000	218000	It's not just emoticons. These days people respond to something on Facebook with a YouTube link.
218000	221000	You remind me of this song, right?
221000	224000	Imagine if that person was to meet, you would sing that song saying,
224000	227000	listen, you remind me of this song. Let me sing it for you.
227000	231000	In person, he might not sing because he might be too embarrassed of his singing skills.
231000	238000	It is now scientifically proven from the psychiatric angle to other angles to do with socializing and everything else
238000	247000	that people that have a larger than life online persona usually are the exact opposite personalities in real life
247000	252000	because suddenly they have this thing where they can be who they are versus who they want to portray.
252000	258000	You know, we all have these concerns, but the internet is a medium that allows you to make whatever you want to make of it.
258000	260000	It's like a clean slate of paper, right?
260000	266000	So there are people who in real life might be reserved and on the internet might appear white, chirpy and chatty,
266000	272000	and you know, I've met those. However, this is not a stereotype that we can stick to.
272000	276000	There are many who are exactly the same on sort of the internet and real life.
276000	281000	There are those abusive trolls on the internet who are real nice people in real life.
281000	284000	I've seen those. There are those real nice people.
284000	288000	So what is this social networking and the internet doing to them?
288000	290000	Why are really good people?
290000	295000	How you represent yourself on Facebook or Twitter or a blog is just one part of your personality.
295000	297000	We are not one human being.
297000	301000	You know, in Hindi there is a saying, there are four human beings in one human being.
301000	303000	That's because of the weight we are all putting on right now.
303000	310000	Well, then I may be. But on the internet you are portraying a part of you and you're consciously...
310000	312000	Are you portraying or you're playing a part?
312000	315000	You're portraying, playing and you're consciously making it.
315000	317000	You're very conscious of what you're presenting of yourself.
317000	320000	There are so many people that live second lives on the internet.
320000	322000	There are so many people that actually have a different name for them.
322000	325000	So there are so many people that portray the exact opposite.
325000	327000	It's the dream that they are living right through.
327000	332000	I dreamt that this is what I would be and therefore I will put that as my image out there.
332000	334000	And portray that personality.
334000	335000	So what's the problem with that?
335000	338000	There's a huge problem with that because when you go out into real life,
338000	341000	when you sit for 45 minutes on your phone and the computer,
341000	346000	you feel larger than life and suddenly life catches up the minute you go out of the door.
346000	348000	You also feel larger than life when you take a foreign holiday.
348000	351000	You also feel larger than life when you become a TV anchor.
351000	355000	Not when the credit card bill comes later, but for sure, absolutely.
355000	358000	So you don't feel larger than life in any way after a foreign holiday.
358000	361000	See, we have a professional life, we have a personal life, we have a family life,
361000	363000	we have a life with our friends.
363000	366000	We connect in a very different way with our school friends, with our college friends.
366000	368000	These are many lives we lead.
368000	370000	Similarly, we have one internet life.
370000	372000	Or actually, we have many internet lives.
372000	376000	Our persona on Facebook is different, our persona on Twitter is different.
376000	379000	So there are many lives even on the internet.
379000	384000	What I'm trying to say here is that the internet allows everybody to be what they want to be
384000	386000	in many ways, in many directions.
386000	389000	It's an expression of humanity.
389000	391000	It's not against humanity.
391000	395000	What the video is trying to say is that the internet takes you away from humanity.
395000	396000	That's not the case at all.
396000	400000	There may be dangers, but those dangers are the same as real life.
400000	402000	They come from real life, they come from our real life selves.
402000	406000	If you are depressed and you close yourself in a room and you're only Facebook
406000	409000	and then you complain that I'm addicted to Facebook, no.
409000	412000	It's actually because you're depressed that you're not treating your real life friends.
412000	414000	Let me just weigh what you've just said.
414000	418000	So you're saying the fact that you can meet a few more people in your life
418000	424000	that have similar interests far outweighs the dangers of alienation,
424000	427000	of having fake personalities and the biggest danger now
427000	431000	that almost everybody is starting to say has become an epidemic,
431000	436000	which is your life seems very inadequate because of the amazing life
436000	440000	that everybody else artificially portrays on Facebook.
440000	443000	There's a new version of feeling envious about your neighbor going for a foreign holiday
443000	445000	and coming back and showing you pictures.
445000	448000	My point is, those things happen in real life as well.
448000	451000	The internet is just a platform, nothing more.
451000	452000	And you do not think that...
452000	454000	Don't blame the medium.
454000	457000	Whenever there's new technology, from the printing press,
457000	463000	to the mobile phone, to the telephone itself, to aviation, to TV, to photography,
463000	469000	anything that is discomfort, humanity doesn't know how to really adapt to it.
469000	471000	It leads to things we had not thought of.
471000	475000	We take some time to adapt to it, to get used to it, to get a hang of it.
475000	479000	The biggest way in which we've done that with the internet is with the mobile phone
479000	482000	because we have mobility, we're not stuck to a machine.
482000	486000	That is the biggest sort of boon we've got that internet is now in our hands.
486000	488000	So you're not stuck to a machine that is in our hand?
488000	489000	Has it needed to us?
489000	493000	Well, you could be walking and you can intermittently keep checking.
493000	495000	I think people are getting used to it.
495000	496000	I think people are getting used to it.
496000	497000	People switch off their...
497000	500000	It's pretty much led to some of the worst things happening
500000	502000	when you actually have real-life conversations
502000	505000	where people are more occupied with their phone than to talk to you.
505000	506000	And that has led to...
506000	507000	Restaurants, movies and other business...
507000	509000	It's gone for a complete six, right?
509000	512000	And that has led to an evolution of etiquette.
512000	515000	Just as in the internet era, we had netiquette.
515000	517000	Now we have smartphone etiquette revolving.
517000	519000	I'm going to do a little quick fire with you.
521000	525000	The last time you actually used your phone when you were out with friends was...
525000	526000	Yesterday evening.
526000	527000	Yes, okay, great.
527000	528000	So, you know, kind of...
528000	529000	The quick fire faster...
529000	531000	But they were doing it as well.
531000	532000	So see, where's the etiquette then?
532000	533000	You spoke about it.
533000	535000	You know, you can throw out the rules.
535000	536000	Who's going to stick to them?
536000	539000	Especially when the seduction of technology is so amazing.
539000	541000	Don't be all multitasked these days.
541000	542000	Exactly.
542000	543000	There we go again.
543000	544000	Do you get usually nervous
544000	546000	if there's a very interesting conversation happening
546000	547000	around a particular topic
547000	549000	which has to do with you and your friends
549000	550000	and you haven't yet participated
550000	551000	because you're a little busy?
551000	555000	You know, this trap he is pulling me into...
555000	557000	So let me ask him questions
557000	559000	and I'll play me into a bigger trap than this.
559000	560000	I have no problem.
560000	561000	How edgy?
561000	563000	First answer mine, then we go into...
563000	565000	You know the answer, next question.
565000	567000	Very edgy, okay, alright.
567000	569000	And the last one has quick fire.
569000	572000	Can you give me a reason why suddenly
572000	575000	the biggest thing that has ever hit the world?
575000	579000	And I'm saying from the time we've evolved as human beings
579000	581000	the Facebook has taken to be the biggest thing
581000	583000	that has got people together.
583000	586000	One billion and counting is suddenly going
586000	587000	with negative growth.
587000	588000	It's only one billion people.
588000	590000	What other medium reaches?
590000	592000	Which TV channel?
592000	593000	Which newspaper?
593000	595000	This is one social networking site.
595000	596000	Facebook.
596000	598000	Facebook will go from one billion
598000	600000	to a few billions much faster.
600000	602000	The negative growth might be right now
602000	606000	but you will see the future will astound you.
606000	608000	The normal conventional wisdom says
608000	610000	that once you lose momentum
610000	611000	you never gain it back
611000	612000	especially when it's true with something like this.
612000	616000	I predict that the fact people are starting to realise
616000	618000	that this could be one of the worst ways of communicating
618000	620000	is starting to dawn on most people.
620000	621000	You of course don't agree
621000	623000	but then that's exactly why we had you here.
623000	624000	Thank you so much.
624000	625000	Fantastic talking to you
625000	627000	and thank you for being part of the quick fire too
627000	630000	even though I didn't get all the answers that I wanted.
630000	632000	So is it really true?
632000	634000	Could social networking, Facebook, media
634000	636000	the way we communicate alienate us
636000	639000	or should we go back to using Facebook
639000	641000	for what it originally was for?
641000	643000	Checking out ex-girlfriends and boyfriends
643000	644000	to see how fat they got.
644000	646000	Well that's a question you can answer.
646000	648000	We'll see you next week on The Contrarian.
648000	649000	Thank you.
649000	650000	Thanks a lot.
671000	686000	I am The Contrarian and this is my world.
701000	703000	Thank you.
