00:00.000 --> 00:04.000
I am the Contrary and this is my world.

00:12.000 --> 00:17.000
Hi, my name is Shivam Vezhan. I'm here to take on Rajiv Makhani on his bizarre idea

00:17.000 --> 00:21.000
that social media alienates people rather than brings them together.

00:31.000 --> 00:34.000
You can't see how the man should have followed the pictures.

00:34.000 --> 00:38.000
Technology is a strange beast. It comes bearing gifts with one hand

00:38.000 --> 00:41.000
and it will always stab you in the back with the other.

00:41.000 --> 00:45.000
Now that was supposed to be the cliché saying, every time something in the world of technology

00:45.000 --> 00:50.000
truly takes off, there are many people that will be there to make sure they pull it down.

00:50.000 --> 00:54.000
Is it because it's such an easy hit? Is it because it really paints a big bull's eye

00:54.000 --> 00:58.000
and what's happening with these 20 million people that seem to be resonating

00:58.000 --> 01:01.000
with this Gary Turk guy in the look-up video?

01:01.000 --> 01:08.000
Alright, so we have you here. We've all set to find out from you as to why this is something that keeps coming up.

01:08.000 --> 01:13.000
Our viewpoint is that while it is a cliché at one time, it's made a huge comeback,

01:13.000 --> 01:16.000
not just because it's a video and the 20 million people that watched it,

01:16.000 --> 01:22.000
but because true sense is starting to now dawn on people that using technology all the time

01:22.000 --> 01:27.000
as their primary form of communication could be a serious recipe for disaster.

01:27.000 --> 01:32.000
You obviously don't really believe in that, so a minute, minute and a half all yours to tell me why we're wrong.

01:32.000 --> 01:36.000
Well, you could make a case of social media addictive and you might take it for real-time interaction,

01:36.000 --> 01:41.000
but sooner or later everybody makes friends on social media with particular overlapping interests

01:41.000 --> 01:43.000
and then they decide to meet in person.

01:43.000 --> 01:47.000
Now, I'm meeting you for the first time here, but I might go and add you on Facebook.

01:47.000 --> 01:50.000
I don't even need to go home. I can add you on Facebook right here on my phone.

01:50.000 --> 01:56.000
So many of us who use social media for years, be it in the blogging boom or Twitter, Facebook

01:56.000 --> 02:02.000
or e-groups which are now forgotten, I have made online friends into real-life friends, met them.

02:02.000 --> 02:06.000
You even forget. You become so close that you even forget that you met through Facebook once upon a time.

02:06.000 --> 02:09.000
So I don't think this binary really exists.

02:09.000 --> 02:13.000
That video shows people hurling into a room, but actually now with smartphones,

02:13.000 --> 02:18.000
you're not clustered in a room at all. You're mobile everywhere.

02:18.000 --> 02:23.000
So you're saying that for generations with the way even the human evolution has happened,

02:23.000 --> 02:28.000
which is face-to-face, which is direct eye contact, which is actually a little touch

02:28.000 --> 02:35.000
and everything else that's been the general guards of everything that we've done with evolution,

02:35.000 --> 02:39.000
the pillar blocks of how we all evolved. You're saying it doesn't really matter.

02:39.000 --> 02:43.000
We can move to this new system and there will be absolutely no ripple effect of it.

02:43.000 --> 02:47.000
No, it matters. I'm not saying that everybody should stop meeting each other in sort of person,

02:47.000 --> 02:53.000
but what I'm saying is that this eye contact for instance in person is replicated on the internet

02:53.000 --> 02:56.000
with its own language. Emoticons, for instance, do that.

02:56.000 --> 03:02.000
When you're seeing something sarcastically in your smiley, that smiley is basically replicating the smiley.

03:02.000 --> 03:08.000
This reminds me of the fact that the first time smileys became a big hit,

03:08.000 --> 03:13.000
it was because you kind of thought, okay, was that a little harsh? Let me put a smiley at the back.

03:13.000 --> 03:17.000
So it doesn't actually lead to a lot of contrary viewpoints.

03:17.000 --> 03:22.000
So if I sat here and spoke with you and my level of harshness and sarcasm,

03:22.000 --> 03:27.000
because you're with me, would be far more muted because I would give you some respect.

03:27.000 --> 03:32.000
That respect is usually lost out there because I can just camouflage by using an emoticon.

03:32.000 --> 03:38.000
It's not just emoticons. These days people respond to something on Facebook with a YouTube link.

03:38.000 --> 03:41.000
You remind me of this song, right?

03:41.000 --> 03:44.000
Imagine if that person was to meet, you would sing that song saying,

03:44.000 --> 03:47.000
listen, you remind me of this song. Let me sing it for you.

03:47.000 --> 03:51.000
In person, he might not sing because he might be too embarrassed of his singing skills.

03:51.000 --> 03:58.000
It is now scientifically proven from the psychiatric angle to other angles to do with socializing and everything else

03:58.000 --> 04:07.000
that people that have a larger than life online persona usually are the exact opposite personalities in real life

04:07.000 --> 04:12.000
because suddenly they have this thing where they can be who they are versus who they want to portray.

04:12.000 --> 04:18.000
You know, we all have these concerns, but the internet is a medium that allows you to make whatever you want to make of it.

04:18.000 --> 04:20.000
It's like a clean slate of paper, right?

04:20.000 --> 04:26.000
So there are people who in real life might be reserved and on the internet might appear white, chirpy and chatty,

04:26.000 --> 04:32.000
and you know, I've met those. However, this is not a stereotype that we can stick to.

04:32.000 --> 04:36.000
There are many who are exactly the same on sort of the internet and real life.

04:36.000 --> 04:41.000
There are those abusive trolls on the internet who are real nice people in real life.

04:41.000 --> 04:44.000
I've seen those. There are those real nice people.

04:44.000 --> 04:48.000
So what is this social networking and the internet doing to them?

04:48.000 --> 04:50.000
Why are really good people?

04:50.000 --> 04:55.000
How you represent yourself on Facebook or Twitter or a blog is just one part of your personality.

04:55.000 --> 04:57.000
We are not one human being.

04:57.000 --> 05:01.000
You know, in Hindi there is a saying, there are four human beings in one human being.

05:01.000 --> 05:03.000
That's because of the weight we are all putting on right now.

05:03.000 --> 05:10.000
Well, then I may be. But on the internet you are portraying a part of you and you're consciously...

05:10.000 --> 05:12.000
Are you portraying or you're playing a part?

05:12.000 --> 05:15.000
You're portraying, playing and you're consciously making it.

05:15.000 --> 05:17.000
You're very conscious of what you're presenting of yourself.

05:17.000 --> 05:20.000
There are so many people that live second lives on the internet.

05:20.000 --> 05:22.000
There are so many people that actually have a different name for them.

05:22.000 --> 05:25.000
So there are so many people that portray the exact opposite.

05:25.000 --> 05:27.000
It's the dream that they are living right through.

05:27.000 --> 05:32.000
I dreamt that this is what I would be and therefore I will put that as my image out there.

05:32.000 --> 05:34.000
And portray that personality.

05:34.000 --> 05:35.000
So what's the problem with that?

05:35.000 --> 05:38.000
There's a huge problem with that because when you go out into real life,

05:38.000 --> 05:41.000
when you sit for 45 minutes on your phone and the computer,

05:41.000 --> 05:46.000
you feel larger than life and suddenly life catches up the minute you go out of the door.

05:46.000 --> 05:48.000
You also feel larger than life when you take a foreign holiday.

05:48.000 --> 05:51.000
You also feel larger than life when you become a TV anchor.

05:51.000 --> 05:55.000
Not when the credit card bill comes later, but for sure, absolutely.

05:55.000 --> 05:58.000
So you don't feel larger than life in any way after a foreign holiday.

05:58.000 --> 06:01.000
See, we have a professional life, we have a personal life, we have a family life,

06:01.000 --> 06:03.000
we have a life with our friends.

06:03.000 --> 06:06.000
We connect in a very different way with our school friends, with our college friends.

06:06.000 --> 06:08.000
These are many lives we lead.

06:08.000 --> 06:10.000
Similarly, we have one internet life.

06:10.000 --> 06:12.000
Or actually, we have many internet lives.

06:12.000 --> 06:16.000
Our persona on Facebook is different, our persona on Twitter is different.

06:16.000 --> 06:19.000
So there are many lives even on the internet.

06:19.000 --> 06:24.000
What I'm trying to say here is that the internet allows everybody to be what they want to be

06:24.000 --> 06:26.000
in many ways, in many directions.

06:26.000 --> 06:29.000
It's an expression of humanity.

06:29.000 --> 06:31.000
It's not against humanity.

06:31.000 --> 06:35.000
What the video is trying to say is that the internet takes you away from humanity.

06:35.000 --> 06:36.000
That's not the case at all.

06:36.000 --> 06:40.000
There may be dangers, but those dangers are the same as real life.

06:40.000 --> 06:42.000
They come from real life, they come from our real life selves.

06:42.000 --> 06:46.000
If you are depressed and you close yourself in a room and you're only Facebook

06:46.000 --> 06:49.000
and then you complain that I'm addicted to Facebook, no.

06:49.000 --> 06:52.000
It's actually because you're depressed that you're not treating your real life friends.

06:52.000 --> 06:54.000
Let me just weigh what you've just said.

06:54.000 --> 06:58.000
So you're saying the fact that you can meet a few more people in your life

06:58.000 --> 07:04.000
that have similar interests far outweighs the dangers of alienation,

07:04.000 --> 07:07.000
of having fake personalities and the biggest danger now

07:07.000 --> 07:11.000
that almost everybody is starting to say has become an epidemic,

07:11.000 --> 07:16.000
which is your life seems very inadequate because of the amazing life

07:16.000 --> 07:20.000
that everybody else artificially portrays on Facebook.

07:20.000 --> 07:23.000
There's a new version of feeling envious about your neighbor going for a foreign holiday

07:23.000 --> 07:25.000
and coming back and showing you pictures.

07:25.000 --> 07:28.000
My point is, those things happen in real life as well.

07:28.000 --> 07:31.000
The internet is just a platform, nothing more.

07:31.000 --> 07:32.000
And you do not think that...

07:32.000 --> 07:34.000
Don't blame the medium.

07:34.000 --> 07:37.000
Whenever there's new technology, from the printing press,

07:37.000 --> 07:43.000
to the mobile phone, to the telephone itself, to aviation, to TV, to photography,

07:43.000 --> 07:49.000
anything that is discomfort, humanity doesn't know how to really adapt to it.

07:49.000 --> 07:51.000
It leads to things we had not thought of.

07:51.000 --> 07:55.000
We take some time to adapt to it, to get used to it, to get a hang of it.

07:55.000 --> 07:59.000
The biggest way in which we've done that with the internet is with the mobile phone

07:59.000 --> 08:02.000
because we have mobility, we're not stuck to a machine.

08:02.000 --> 08:06.000
That is the biggest sort of boon we've got that internet is now in our hands.

08:06.000 --> 08:08.000
So you're not stuck to a machine that is in our hand?

08:08.000 --> 08:09.000
Has it needed to us?

08:09.000 --> 08:13.000
Well, you could be walking and you can intermittently keep checking.

08:13.000 --> 08:15.000
I think people are getting used to it.

08:15.000 --> 08:16.000
I think people are getting used to it.

08:16.000 --> 08:17.000
People switch off their...

08:17.000 --> 08:20.000
It's pretty much led to some of the worst things happening

08:20.000 --> 08:22.000
when you actually have real-life conversations

08:22.000 --> 08:25.000
where people are more occupied with their phone than to talk to you.

08:25.000 --> 08:26.000
And that has led to...

08:26.000 --> 08:27.000
Restaurants, movies and other business...

08:27.000 --> 08:29.000
It's gone for a complete six, right?

08:29.000 --> 08:32.000
And that has led to an evolution of etiquette.

08:32.000 --> 08:35.000
Just as in the internet era, we had netiquette.

08:35.000 --> 08:37.000
Now we have smartphone etiquette revolving.

08:37.000 --> 08:39.000
I'm going to do a little quick fire with you.

08:41.000 --> 08:45.000
The last time you actually used your phone when you were out with friends was...

08:45.000 --> 08:46.000
Yesterday evening.

08:46.000 --> 08:47.000
Yes, okay, great.

08:47.000 --> 08:48.000
So, you know, kind of...

08:48.000 --> 08:49.000
The quick fire faster...

08:49.000 --> 08:51.000
But they were doing it as well.

08:51.000 --> 08:52.000
So see, where's the etiquette then?

08:52.000 --> 08:53.000
You spoke about it.

08:53.000 --> 08:55.000
You know, you can throw out the rules.

08:55.000 --> 08:56.000
Who's going to stick to them?

08:56.000 --> 08:59.000
Especially when the seduction of technology is so amazing.

08:59.000 --> 09:01.000
Don't be all multitasked these days.

09:01.000 --> 09:02.000
Exactly.

09:02.000 --> 09:03.000
There we go again.

09:03.000 --> 09:04.000
Do you get usually nervous

09:04.000 --> 09:06.000
if there's a very interesting conversation happening

09:06.000 --> 09:07.000
around a particular topic

09:07.000 --> 09:09.000
which has to do with you and your friends

09:09.000 --> 09:10.000
and you haven't yet participated

09:10.000 --> 09:11.000
because you're a little busy?

09:11.000 --> 09:15.000
You know, this trap he is pulling me into...

09:15.000 --> 09:17.000
So let me ask him questions

09:17.000 --> 09:19.000
and I'll play me into a bigger trap than this.

09:19.000 --> 09:20.000
I have no problem.

09:20.000 --> 09:21.000
How edgy?

09:21.000 --> 09:23.000
First answer mine, then we go into...

09:23.000 --> 09:25.000
You know the answer, next question.

09:25.000 --> 09:27.000
Very edgy, okay, alright.

09:27.000 --> 09:29.000
And the last one has quick fire.

09:29.000 --> 09:32.000
Can you give me a reason why suddenly

09:32.000 --> 09:35.000
the biggest thing that has ever hit the world?

09:35.000 --> 09:39.000
And I'm saying from the time we've evolved as human beings

09:39.000 --> 09:41.000
the Facebook has taken to be the biggest thing

09:41.000 --> 09:43.000
that has got people together.

09:43.000 --> 09:46.000
One billion and counting is suddenly going

09:46.000 --> 09:47.000
with negative growth.

09:47.000 --> 09:48.000
It's only one billion people.

09:48.000 --> 09:50.000
What other medium reaches?

09:50.000 --> 09:52.000
Which TV channel?

09:52.000 --> 09:53.000
Which newspaper?

09:53.000 --> 09:55.000
This is one social networking site.

09:55.000 --> 09:56.000
Facebook.

09:56.000 --> 09:58.000
Facebook will go from one billion

09:58.000 --> 10:00.000
to a few billions much faster.

10:00.000 --> 10:02.000
The negative growth might be right now

10:02.000 --> 10:06.000
but you will see the future will astound you.

10:06.000 --> 10:08.000
The normal conventional wisdom says

10:08.000 --> 10:10.000
that once you lose momentum

10:10.000 --> 10:11.000
you never gain it back

10:11.000 --> 10:12.000
especially when it's true with something like this.

10:12.000 --> 10:16.000
I predict that the fact people are starting to realise

10:16.000 --> 10:18.000
that this could be one of the worst ways of communicating

10:18.000 --> 10:20.000
is starting to dawn on most people.

10:20.000 --> 10:21.000
You of course don't agree

10:21.000 --> 10:23.000
but then that's exactly why we had you here.

10:23.000 --> 10:24.000
Thank you so much.

10:24.000 --> 10:25.000
Fantastic talking to you

10:25.000 --> 10:27.000
and thank you for being part of the quick fire too

10:27.000 --> 10:30.000
even though I didn't get all the answers that I wanted.

10:30.000 --> 10:32.000
So is it really true?

10:32.000 --> 10:34.000
Could social networking, Facebook, media

10:34.000 --> 10:36.000
the way we communicate alienate us

10:36.000 --> 10:39.000
or should we go back to using Facebook

10:39.000 --> 10:41.000
for what it originally was for?

10:41.000 --> 10:43.000
Checking out ex-girlfriends and boyfriends

10:43.000 --> 10:44.000
to see how fat they got.

10:44.000 --> 10:46.000
Well that's a question you can answer.

10:46.000 --> 10:48.000
We'll see you next week on The Contrarian.

10:48.000 --> 10:49.000
Thank you.

10:49.000 --> 10:50.000
Thanks a lot.

11:11.000 --> 11:26.000
I am The Contrarian and this is my world.

11:41.000 --> 11:43.000
Thank you.
