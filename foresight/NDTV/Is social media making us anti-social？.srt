1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
I am the Contrary and this is my world.

2
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Hi, my name is Shivam Vezhan. I'm here to take on Rajiv Makhani on his bizarre idea

3
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,000
that social media alienates people rather than brings them together.

4
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
You can't see how the man should have followed the pictures.

5
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Technology is a strange beast. It comes bearing gifts with one hand

6
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
and it will always stab you in the back with the other.

7
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Now that was supposed to be the cliché saying, every time something in the world of technology

8
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:50,000
truly takes off, there are many people that will be there to make sure they pull it down.

9
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Is it because it's such an easy hit? Is it because it really paints a big bull's eye

10
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
and what's happening with these 20 million people that seem to be resonating

11
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
with this Gary Turk guy in the look-up video?

12
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Alright, so we have you here. We've all set to find out from you as to why this is something that keeps coming up.

13
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Our viewpoint is that while it is a cliché at one time, it's made a huge comeback,

14
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
not just because it's a video and the 20 million people that watched it,

15
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:22,000
but because true sense is starting to now dawn on people that using technology all the time

16
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:27,000
as their primary form of communication could be a serious recipe for disaster.

17
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:32,000
You obviously don't really believe in that, so a minute, minute and a half all yours to tell me why we're wrong.

18
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Well, you could make a case of social media addictive and you might take it for real-time interaction,

19
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:41,000
but sooner or later everybody makes friends on social media with particular overlapping interests

20
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
and then they decide to meet in person.

21
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Now, I'm meeting you for the first time here, but I might go and add you on Facebook.

22
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000
I don't even need to go home. I can add you on Facebook right here on my phone.

23
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:56,000
So many of us who use social media for years, be it in the blogging boom or Twitter, Facebook

24
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:02,000
or e-groups which are now forgotten, I have made online friends into real-life friends, met them.

25
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:06,000
You even forget. You become so close that you even forget that you met through Facebook once upon a time.

26
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
So I don't think this binary really exists.

27
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:13,000
That video shows people hurling into a room, but actually now with smartphones,

28
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:18,000
you're not clustered in a room at all. You're mobile everywhere.

29
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:23,000
So you're saying that for generations with the way even the human evolution has happened,

30
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:28,000
which is face-to-face, which is direct eye contact, which is actually a little touch

31
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:35,000
and everything else that's been the general guards of everything that we've done with evolution,

32
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:39,000
the pillar blocks of how we all evolved. You're saying it doesn't really matter.

33
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:43,000
We can move to this new system and there will be absolutely no ripple effect of it.

34
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:47,000
No, it matters. I'm not saying that everybody should stop meeting each other in sort of person,

35
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:53,000
but what I'm saying is that this eye contact for instance in person is replicated on the internet

36
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,000
with its own language. Emoticons, for instance, do that.

37
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:02,000
When you're seeing something sarcastically in your smiley, that smiley is basically replicating the smiley.

38
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:08,000
This reminds me of the fact that the first time smileys became a big hit,

39
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:13,000
it was because you kind of thought, okay, was that a little harsh? Let me put a smiley at the back.

40
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:17,000
So it doesn't actually lead to a lot of contrary viewpoints.

41
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:22,000
So if I sat here and spoke with you and my level of harshness and sarcasm,

42
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:27,000
because you're with me, would be far more muted because I would give you some respect.

43
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:32,000
That respect is usually lost out there because I can just camouflage by using an emoticon.

44
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:38,000
It's not just emoticons. These days people respond to something on Facebook with a YouTube link.

45
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,000
You remind me of this song, right?

46
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Imagine if that person was to meet, you would sing that song saying,

47
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,000
listen, you remind me of this song. Let me sing it for you.

48
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:51,000
In person, he might not sing because he might be too embarrassed of his singing skills.

49
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:58,000
It is now scientifically proven from the psychiatric angle to other angles to do with socializing and everything else

50
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:07,000
that people that have a larger than life online persona usually are the exact opposite personalities in real life

51
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:12,000
because suddenly they have this thing where they can be who they are versus who they want to portray.

52
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:18,000
You know, we all have these concerns, but the internet is a medium that allows you to make whatever you want to make of it.

53
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
It's like a clean slate of paper, right?

54
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:26,000
So there are people who in real life might be reserved and on the internet might appear white, chirpy and chatty,

55
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:32,000
and you know, I've met those. However, this is not a stereotype that we can stick to.

56
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:36,000
There are many who are exactly the same on sort of the internet and real life.

57
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:41,000
There are those abusive trolls on the internet who are real nice people in real life.

58
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,000
I've seen those. There are those real nice people.

59
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:48,000
So what is this social networking and the internet doing to them?

60
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Why are really good people?

61
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:55,000
How you represent yourself on Facebook or Twitter or a blog is just one part of your personality.

62
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
We are not one human being.

63
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:01,000
You know, in Hindi there is a saying, there are four human beings in one human being.

64
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
That's because of the weight we are all putting on right now.

65
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Well, then I may be. But on the internet you are portraying a part of you and you're consciously...

66
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Are you portraying or you're playing a part?

67
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,000
You're portraying, playing and you're consciously making it.

68
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
You're very conscious of what you're presenting of yourself.

69
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:20,000
There are so many people that live second lives on the internet.

70
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
There are so many people that actually have a different name for them.

71
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,000
So there are so many people that portray the exact opposite.

72
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
It's the dream that they are living right through.

73
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:32,000
I dreamt that this is what I would be and therefore I will put that as my image out there.

74
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
And portray that personality.

75
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
So what's the problem with that?

76
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:38,000
There's a huge problem with that because when you go out into real life,

77
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,000
when you sit for 45 minutes on your phone and the computer,

78
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:46,000
you feel larger than life and suddenly life catches up the minute you go out of the door.

79
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
You also feel larger than life when you take a foreign holiday.

80
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,000
You also feel larger than life when you become a TV anchor.

81
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Not when the credit card bill comes later, but for sure, absolutely.

82
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,000
So you don't feel larger than life in any way after a foreign holiday.

83
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,000
See, we have a professional life, we have a personal life, we have a family life,

84
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
we have a life with our friends.

85
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,000
We connect in a very different way with our school friends, with our college friends.

86
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
These are many lives we lead.

87
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Similarly, we have one internet life.

88
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Or actually, we have many internet lives.

89
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Our persona on Facebook is different, our persona on Twitter is different.

90
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,000
So there are many lives even on the internet.

91
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:24,000
What I'm trying to say here is that the internet allows everybody to be what they want to be

92
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
in many ways, in many directions.

93
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,000
It's an expression of humanity.

94
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
It's not against humanity.

95
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:35,000
What the video is trying to say is that the internet takes you away from humanity.

96
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
That's not the case at all.

97
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:40,000
There may be dangers, but those dangers are the same as real life.

98
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
They come from real life, they come from our real life selves.

99
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:46,000
If you are depressed and you close yourself in a room and you're only Facebook

100
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,000
and then you complain that I'm addicted to Facebook, no.

101
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,000
It's actually because you're depressed that you're not treating your real life friends.

102
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Let me just weigh what you've just said.

103
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:58,000
So you're saying the fact that you can meet a few more people in your life

104
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:04,000
that have similar interests far outweighs the dangers of alienation,

105
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,000
of having fake personalities and the biggest danger now

106
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:11,000
that almost everybody is starting to say has become an epidemic,

107
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:16,000
which is your life seems very inadequate because of the amazing life

108
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:20,000
that everybody else artificially portrays on Facebook.

109
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,000
There's a new version of feeling envious about your neighbor going for a foreign holiday

110
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
and coming back and showing you pictures.

111
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:28,000
My point is, those things happen in real life as well.

112
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,000
The internet is just a platform, nothing more.

113
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
And you do not think that...

114
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Don't blame the medium.

115
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Whenever there's new technology, from the printing press,

116
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:43,000
to the mobile phone, to the telephone itself, to aviation, to TV, to photography,

117
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:49,000
anything that is discomfort, humanity doesn't know how to really adapt to it.

118
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
It leads to things we had not thought of.

119
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:55,000
We take some time to adapt to it, to get used to it, to get a hang of it.

120
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:59,000
The biggest way in which we've done that with the internet is with the mobile phone

121
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:02,000
because we have mobility, we're not stuck to a machine.

122
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:06,000
That is the biggest sort of boon we've got that internet is now in our hands.

123
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
So you're not stuck to a machine that is in our hand?

124
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Has it needed to us?

125
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Well, you could be walking and you can intermittently keep checking.

126
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
I think people are getting used to it.

127
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
I think people are getting used to it.

128
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
People switch off their...

129
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:20,000
It's pretty much led to some of the worst things happening

130
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
when you actually have real-life conversations

131
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:25,000
where people are more occupied with their phone than to talk to you.

132
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
And that has led to...

133
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Restaurants, movies and other business...

134
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
It's gone for a complete six, right?

135
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:32,000
And that has led to an evolution of etiquette.

136
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Just as in the internet era, we had netiquette.

137
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Now we have smartphone etiquette revolving.

138
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
I'm going to do a little quick fire with you.

139
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:45,000
The last time you actually used your phone when you were out with friends was...

140
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Yesterday evening.

141
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Yes, okay, great.

142
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
So, you know, kind of...

143
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
The quick fire faster...

144
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
But they were doing it as well.

145
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
So see, where's the etiquette then?

146
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
You spoke about it.

147
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
You know, you can throw out the rules.

148
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Who's going to stick to them?

149
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Especially when the seduction of technology is so amazing.

150
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Don't be all multitasked these days.

151
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Exactly.

152
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
There we go again.

153
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Do you get usually nervous

154
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
if there's a very interesting conversation happening

155
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
around a particular topic

156
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
which has to do with you and your friends

157
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
and you haven't yet participated

158
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
because you're a little busy?

159
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:15,000
You know, this trap he is pulling me into...

160
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
So let me ask him questions

161
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
and I'll play me into a bigger trap than this.

162
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
I have no problem.

163
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
How edgy?

164
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
First answer mine, then we go into...

165
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
You know the answer, next question.

166
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Very edgy, okay, alright.

167
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
And the last one has quick fire.

168
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Can you give me a reason why suddenly

169
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,000
the biggest thing that has ever hit the world?

170
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:39,000
And I'm saying from the time we've evolved as human beings

171
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
the Facebook has taken to be the biggest thing

172
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
that has got people together.

173
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:46,000
One billion and counting is suddenly going

174
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
with negative growth.

175
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
It's only one billion people.

176
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
What other medium reaches?

177
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Which TV channel?

178
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Which newspaper?

179
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
This is one social networking site.

180
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Facebook.

181
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Facebook will go from one billion

182
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
to a few billions much faster.

183
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
The negative growth might be right now

184
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:06,000
but you will see the future will astound you.

185
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
The normal conventional wisdom says

186
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
that once you lose momentum

187
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
you never gain it back

188
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
especially when it's true with something like this.

189
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:16,000
I predict that the fact people are starting to realise

190
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
that this could be one of the worst ways of communicating

191
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
is starting to dawn on most people.

192
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
You of course don't agree

193
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
but then that's exactly why we had you here.

194
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Thank you so much.

195
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Fantastic talking to you

196
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
and thank you for being part of the quick fire too

197
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:30,000
even though I didn't get all the answers that I wanted.

198
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
So is it really true?

199
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Could social networking, Facebook, media

200
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
the way we communicate alienate us

201
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,000
or should we go back to using Facebook

202
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
for what it originally was for?

203
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
Checking out ex-girlfriends and boyfriends

204
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
to see how fat they got.

205
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Well that's a question you can answer.

206
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
We'll see you next week on The Contrarian.

207
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Thank you.

208
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Thanks a lot.

209
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:26,000
I am The Contrarian and this is my world.

210
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
Thank you.
