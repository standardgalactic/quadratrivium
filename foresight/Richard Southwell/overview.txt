1. **Profunctors**: These are like functors between categories with objects A and B and morphisms sets. More precisely, a profunctor from A to B assigns to each pair of objects (A_1, A_2) in A and (B_1, B_2) in B a set P(A_1, A_2; B_1, B_2). Composition of profunctors is associative and has an identity up to isomorphism.

2. **Composition of Profunctors**: If you have two profunctors, P from A to B and Q from B to C, their composition, denoted P ∘_ B Q, maps a pair (A_1, A_2) in A to the set of ways to get from A_1 to B_1 via B, then from B_1 to B_2, and finally to C_2, which is encoded by Q. This composition respects the structure of profunctors.

3. **Can Extensions**: These are a way to "fill in" a diagram in a category to obtain a limit. The left/right can extension depends on whether you're dealing with a diagram indexed by a category with finite limits/colimits (left) or co-limits/tensor products (right).

4. **Co-ends**: These are a dual concept to ends, but instead of considering the limit of a diagram, we consider the colimit and take the set of all ways to do this. Co-ends can be used to express left can extensions in terms of colimits.

5. **Duality**: All of the above concepts have a dual version. For example, right can extensions are dual to left can extensions, and free completions for limits are dual to co-completions for colimits.

6. **Generalization**: The ideas of can extensions, weighted colimits, co-ends, and profunctors are so general that they subsume other mathematical concepts. This means that any concept in category theory can be expressed using these tools.

7. **Application to Discrete Categories**: In the case where A and B are discrete (meaning there's only identity morphisms between objects), a profunctor is essentially like a matrix of non-negative integers, and its composition corresponds to matrix multiplication.

8. **Further Resources**: For a deeper understanding of profunctors and their composition, one can refer to the category theory literature, including Fosco's book "Co-end Calculus," or resources from nlabs.

In summary, profunctors provide a powerful and general tool in category theory that allows for the expression and manipulation of various mathematical concepts through a unified lens. Can extensions, weighted colimits, co-ends, and their dual concepts form a rich web of interrelated ideas that are fundamental to understanding the structure of categories.
