Hello and welcome and in this video I'm going to be explaining why Auto Hockey is just the

00:14.760 --> 00:18.120
greatest program ever.

00:18.120 --> 00:26.360
It's great for customization and accessibility because it allows you to make your own scripts

00:26.360 --> 00:29.600
that do lots of stuff.

00:29.600 --> 00:37.240
So I'll be showcasing a few of my scripts here like this one.

00:37.240 --> 00:48.080
This says when I press Alt, Ctrl Alt and X it will type out all of those texts and

00:48.080 --> 00:49.080
press Enter.

00:49.080 --> 00:55.520
So I drag over Discord here and go on to a private server where I can just test this.

00:55.520 --> 01:03.240
I've pressed Ctrl Alt X and it is typing out stuff for a giveaway I've been doing

01:03.240 --> 01:06.160
on a few servers.

01:06.160 --> 01:16.760
So I can make macros and automatic typing and auto clickers, stuff like that.

01:16.760 --> 01:19.960
So that's very useful for that kind of things.

01:19.960 --> 01:25.080
This is an auto correct for text language.

01:25.080 --> 01:32.760
So whatever I type, whenever I type the stuff between the colons it will expand into the

01:32.760 --> 01:37.880
full version or get smaller if you so wanted it to.

01:37.880 --> 01:46.020
So I've got this to add in the apostrophes for me, capitalise the eyes, expand text language.

01:46.020 --> 01:51.800
This will be very good for school because it means I can type in text language at school

01:51.800 --> 01:55.720
and it will auto correct into proper English.

01:55.720 --> 02:02.040
So I will run this now and test it out.

02:02.040 --> 02:13.160
Now I've got U expands into that, 4 expands into that and this is completely customisable.

02:13.160 --> 02:15.840
So you can do this for whatever you want.

02:15.840 --> 02:22.680
I think somewhere on the internet a guy has made a complete auto correct for this that

02:22.680 --> 02:27.560
can be used in any application and that's quite cool.

02:27.560 --> 02:31.800
So I'll close the auto correct for now.

02:31.800 --> 02:35.720
This one works like the last one did.

02:35.720 --> 02:44.360
When I press some certain buttons it will input the text into a game.

02:44.360 --> 02:54.440
So I use this for role playing in Freelancer which I will open up now to show you how it

02:54.440 --> 02:55.440
works.

02:55.440 --> 03:04.200
So here for a demonstration when I press shift enter it will open chat and type in Genre Toric

03:04.200 --> 03:09.520
which is one of my role play characters on the Discovery Freelancer role play server and

03:09.520 --> 03:13.920
I can type my message after that and fit in with the role play.

03:13.920 --> 03:21.520
Control enter and type in Tee Samburgh which is another one of my characters and alt enter

03:21.520 --> 03:27.200
types in Andrew which is another character Andrew Sanderson.

03:27.200 --> 03:32.920
Another use for it is when you are stuck in a game and it's crashed but you can't get

03:32.920 --> 03:37.040
your mouse out of the window even if you hit the windows key and stuff.

03:37.040 --> 03:42.440
So when the windows menu opens up you can search for what run chrome and it will run

03:42.440 --> 03:46.680
this simple thing which runs the website google.com.

03:46.680 --> 03:51.760
That's useful because when you press the windows key even if you can't use your mouse you can

03:51.760 --> 04:00.400
write run chrome and I'll give you the script press enter and chrome will open up taking

04:00.400 --> 04:04.960
your mouse out of the window it's stuck in.

04:04.960 --> 04:10.120
This in theory toggles hidden files on your system.

04:10.120 --> 04:15.600
I didn't write this code and I don't really know how it works.

04:15.600 --> 04:25.720
Now on startup I have this setup when the computer boots up startupprograms.ahk opens

04:25.720 --> 04:32.600
and that will wait 30 seconds for the computer to orientate itself and start to wake up properly

04:32.600 --> 04:40.240
and it will run steam it will wait another 30 seconds and run discord and then wait one

04:40.240 --> 04:49.960
second and it will run the first code here lock keys it will wait half a second run remap

04:49.960 --> 04:57.920
hide and it will wait another second and write multi clipboard and then it will run dropbox

04:57.920 --> 04:58.920
in the background.

04:59.240 --> 05:04.960
It cuts back on a lot of the computer's stress at the start because it waits before opening

05:04.960 --> 05:10.000
all the programs rather than trying to open them all at once the moment you log in.

05:10.000 --> 05:16.240
So now I'll show you the code to these and then how that ties into these shortcuts and

05:16.240 --> 05:18.080
startup programs properly.

05:18.080 --> 05:27.400
The lock keys script is very useful what this does is it disables the caps lock the number

05:27.400 --> 05:33.720
lock and the scroll lock permanently setting their positions so if I press the caps lock

05:33.720 --> 05:40.640
and unlock the scroll lock buttons now it won't toggle the function and that's very

05:40.640 --> 05:47.840
useful in games and stuff because that means I can assign the keys to do other stuff and

05:47.840 --> 05:52.080
always have it set in the right state for what I want.

05:52.080 --> 05:59.320
This one is two different programs that were combined this top bit I didn't write myself

05:59.320 --> 06:06.560
I downloaded it but I understand most of how it works basically what it does is when I

06:06.560 --> 06:14.480
press the left control and the now disabled caps lock button it will hide Google Chrome

06:14.480 --> 06:20.280
now that doesn't mean that it's minimized that means it's completely hidden it doesn't

06:20.280 --> 06:30.360
even appear on your taskbar taskbar sorry and when I press the left shift and caps lock

06:30.360 --> 06:39.120
it will appear again so I think it is active right now so I will demonstrate Google Chrome

06:39.120 --> 06:46.480
is open control caps lock completely gone not even there but then we'll shift caps lock

06:46.480 --> 06:52.160
I can bring it straight back and to prove that that wasn't me opening and reopening it

06:52.160 --> 07:04.040
let's go on to a random website I visited recently close open very simple now the other

07:04.040 --> 07:10.440
thing that this code does is it remaps some of my buttons I have a button that launches

07:10.440 --> 07:18.880
the calculator app on my keyboard which is launch app 2 and I've this remaps the key

07:18.880 --> 07:26.680
to F13 you can have up to 24 function keys so I thought why not just have some more function

07:26.680 --> 07:33.280
keys I can use for whatever I want so now my calculator button acts as F13 my scroll

07:33.280 --> 07:43.000
lock button is F14 my media play pause button that plays and pauses media although only works

07:43.000 --> 07:50.000
with Windows media player and the like so I never use it that acts as F15 caps lock is

07:50.000 --> 07:59.440
F16 so I can assign caps lock to functions and games the menu button which is that weird

07:59.440 --> 08:07.880
one between the right alt and right control I've remand that F17 and the divide and times

08:07.880 --> 08:16.040
buttons on the numpad so I've set them to run the symbols so the divided by button will

08:16.040 --> 08:25.120
do that and the times button will do that pretty simple this script I don't entirely

08:25.120 --> 08:32.160
understand but it gives me three different clipboards so I can copy and paste three different

08:32.160 --> 08:38.880
things at the same time not quite sure how this works but it does so I have a clipboard

08:38.880 --> 08:44.200
for control C and control V I have one for Windows C and Windows V and I have one for

08:44.200 --> 08:54.280
alt C and alt V so here if I get the word clipboard copied under control C and get the

08:54.280 --> 09:04.000
word until copied under Windows C and get the word old under alt C now if I press all

09:04.000 --> 09:16.160
of the pace that was control V Windows V alt V very useful indeed now all of those have

09:16.160 --> 09:24.120
to be ran as admin to work in any app which is where these shortcuts come in so start

09:24.960 --> 09:33.520
up programs.hk is running these shortcuts here not the exe file what those shortcuts do is

09:33.520 --> 09:46.600
they run a thing in task scheduler so remap hide runs this here multi clipboard runs this

09:46.600 --> 09:54.080
task here and lock keys runs this task here they're allowed to run with highest privileges

09:54.080 --> 10:01.560
which means well it runs as admin without the pop-up box requiring you to click yes

10:01.560 --> 10:10.600
and no and all that jazz and those run these as admin like I just said like this one allows

10:10.640 --> 10:19.000
me to drag Windows around by holding the alt key like in Linux so right now I'm holding

10:19.000 --> 10:25.640
down alt and I'm dragging it from anywhere I want it's not flawless it doesn't work on

10:25.640 --> 10:33.880
maximize Windows but as you're about to see it works on full screen which is a bit of a

10:33.960 --> 10:41.520
problem so I don't use it anymore now we come to what I consider my masterpiece this allows

10:41.520 --> 10:49.480
me to make auto hockey scripts on a computer that doesn't have auto hockey installed this allows

10:49.480 --> 10:57.840
me to upload my dot AHK script to drop box by the way the AHK script will be unusable on

10:57.880 --> 11:06.520
say a school computer and the home computer will recognize that files there and run it through

11:06.520 --> 11:14.560
the AHK to exe converter so for the sake of demonstration because I'm sure that didn't make

11:14.560 --> 11:26.920
too much sense I have got my tablet open and the files ready to go so I when this is running

11:27.640 --> 11:36.040
every two minutes it will double click on this shortcut running it right now it links to something

11:36.040 --> 11:45.480
that doesn't exist being remote dot AHK in this folder here okay I've set it so when I open up this

11:45.480 --> 11:52.120
I'll have five seconds to react all the things are in place so remotely you'll place in code

11:52.120 --> 12:00.840
dot AHK and remote dot AHK via the dropbox website and let's go

12:10.360 --> 12:18.760
yes it's working so opens up the converter does that converts it and boom we're done here

12:19.720 --> 12:27.560
let's close that and open up here code dot exe and now if I run that that opens up

12:29.080 --> 12:37.160
the exact code that I put into the AHK file so this allows me to make scripts

12:38.200 --> 12:42.520
remotely from anywhere provided that that loop is running on my computer

12:43.080 --> 12:50.360
so if I say delete remote dot AHK and this shortcut won't do anything

12:52.120 --> 12:59.640
and then if I bring it back from the dead which one is it I don't even know restore that one

13:01.160 --> 13:09.640
then when I run this yet again it does all of that so that is auto hotkey in a nutshell

13:10.440 --> 13:16.520
very useful program I really enjoy it it's giving me a lot more options with my keyboard

13:17.240 --> 13:22.040
and with what I can do with my computer I could probably make a bot to do a specific

13:22.040 --> 13:29.000
thing in a game if I so wanted so yes thanks for sticking around if you've made it this far into

13:29.000 --> 13:36.280
the video which I doubt any of you have like if you like subscribe if you want more and that will be

13:36.280 --> 13:41.880
me for this video see you guys ice out
