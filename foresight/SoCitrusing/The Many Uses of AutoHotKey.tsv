0	14760	Hello and welcome and in this video I'm going to be explaining why Auto Hockey is just the
14760	18120	greatest program ever.
18120	26360	It's great for customization and accessibility because it allows you to make your own scripts
26360	29600	that do lots of stuff.
29600	37240	So I'll be showcasing a few of my scripts here like this one.
37240	48080	This says when I press Alt, Ctrl Alt and X it will type out all of those texts and
48080	49080	press Enter.
49080	55520	So I drag over Discord here and go on to a private server where I can just test this.
55520	63240	I've pressed Ctrl Alt X and it is typing out stuff for a giveaway I've been doing
63240	66160	on a few servers.
66160	76760	So I can make macros and automatic typing and auto clickers, stuff like that.
76760	79960	So that's very useful for that kind of things.
79960	85080	This is an auto correct for text language.
85080	92760	So whatever I type, whenever I type the stuff between the colons it will expand into the
92760	97880	full version or get smaller if you so wanted it to.
97880	106020	So I've got this to add in the apostrophes for me, capitalise the eyes, expand text language.
106020	111800	This will be very good for school because it means I can type in text language at school
111800	115720	and it will auto correct into proper English.
115720	122040	So I will run this now and test it out.
122040	133160	Now I've got U expands into that, 4 expands into that and this is completely customisable.
133160	135840	So you can do this for whatever you want.
135840	142680	I think somewhere on the internet a guy has made a complete auto correct for this that
142680	147560	can be used in any application and that's quite cool.
147560	151800	So I'll close the auto correct for now.
151800	155720	This one works like the last one did.
155720	164360	When I press some certain buttons it will input the text into a game.
164360	174440	So I use this for role playing in Freelancer which I will open up now to show you how it
174440	175440	works.
175440	184200	So here for a demonstration when I press shift enter it will open chat and type in Genre Toric
184200	189520	which is one of my role play characters on the Discovery Freelancer role play server and
189520	193920	I can type my message after that and fit in with the role play.
193920	201520	Control enter and type in Tee Samburgh which is another one of my characters and alt enter
201520	207200	types in Andrew which is another character Andrew Sanderson.
207200	212920	Another use for it is when you are stuck in a game and it's crashed but you can't get
212920	217040	your mouse out of the window even if you hit the windows key and stuff.
217040	222440	So when the windows menu opens up you can search for what run chrome and it will run
222440	226680	this simple thing which runs the website google.com.
226680	231760	That's useful because when you press the windows key even if you can't use your mouse you can
231760	240400	write run chrome and I'll give you the script press enter and chrome will open up taking
240400	244960	your mouse out of the window it's stuck in.
244960	250120	This in theory toggles hidden files on your system.
250120	255600	I didn't write this code and I don't really know how it works.
255600	265720	Now on startup I have this setup when the computer boots up startupprograms.ahk opens
265720	272600	and that will wait 30 seconds for the computer to orientate itself and start to wake up properly
272600	280240	and it will run steam it will wait another 30 seconds and run discord and then wait one
280240	289960	second and it will run the first code here lock keys it will wait half a second run remap
289960	297920	hide and it will wait another second and write multi clipboard and then it will run dropbox
297920	298920	in the background.
299240	304960	It cuts back on a lot of the computer's stress at the start because it waits before opening
304960	310000	all the programs rather than trying to open them all at once the moment you log in.
310000	316240	So now I'll show you the code to these and then how that ties into these shortcuts and
316240	318080	startup programs properly.
318080	327400	The lock keys script is very useful what this does is it disables the caps lock the number
327400	333720	lock and the scroll lock permanently setting their positions so if I press the caps lock
333720	340640	and unlock the scroll lock buttons now it won't toggle the function and that's very
340640	347840	useful in games and stuff because that means I can assign the keys to do other stuff and
347840	352080	always have it set in the right state for what I want.
352080	359320	This one is two different programs that were combined this top bit I didn't write myself
359320	366560	I downloaded it but I understand most of how it works basically what it does is when I
366560	374480	press the left control and the now disabled caps lock button it will hide Google Chrome
374480	380280	now that doesn't mean that it's minimized that means it's completely hidden it doesn't
380280	390360	even appear on your taskbar taskbar sorry and when I press the left shift and caps lock
390360	399120	it will appear again so I think it is active right now so I will demonstrate Google Chrome
399120	406480	is open control caps lock completely gone not even there but then we'll shift caps lock
406480	412160	I can bring it straight back and to prove that that wasn't me opening and reopening it
412160	424040	let's go on to a random website I visited recently close open very simple now the other
424040	430440	thing that this code does is it remaps some of my buttons I have a button that launches
430440	438880	the calculator app on my keyboard which is launch app 2 and I've this remaps the key
438880	446680	to F13 you can have up to 24 function keys so I thought why not just have some more function
446680	453280	keys I can use for whatever I want so now my calculator button acts as F13 my scroll
453280	463000	lock button is F14 my media play pause button that plays and pauses media although only works
463000	470000	with Windows media player and the like so I never use it that acts as F15 caps lock is
470000	479440	F16 so I can assign caps lock to functions and games the menu button which is that weird
479440	487880	one between the right alt and right control I've remand that F17 and the divide and times
487880	496040	buttons on the numpad so I've set them to run the symbols so the divided by button will
496040	505120	do that and the times button will do that pretty simple this script I don't entirely
505120	512160	understand but it gives me three different clipboards so I can copy and paste three different
512160	518880	things at the same time not quite sure how this works but it does so I have a clipboard
518880	524200	for control C and control V I have one for Windows C and Windows V and I have one for
524200	534280	alt C and alt V so here if I get the word clipboard copied under control C and get the
534280	544000	word until copied under Windows C and get the word old under alt C now if I press all
544000	556160	of the pace that was control V Windows V alt V very useful indeed now all of those have
556160	564120	to be ran as admin to work in any app which is where these shortcuts come in so start
564960	573520	up programs.hk is running these shortcuts here not the exe file what those shortcuts do is
573520	586600	they run a thing in task scheduler so remap hide runs this here multi clipboard runs this
586600	594080	task here and lock keys runs this task here they're allowed to run with highest privileges
594080	601560	which means well it runs as admin without the pop-up box requiring you to click yes
601560	610600	and no and all that jazz and those run these as admin like I just said like this one allows
610640	619000	me to drag Windows around by holding the alt key like in Linux so right now I'm holding
619000	625640	down alt and I'm dragging it from anywhere I want it's not flawless it doesn't work on
625640	633880	maximize Windows but as you're about to see it works on full screen which is a bit of a
633960	641520	problem so I don't use it anymore now we come to what I consider my masterpiece this allows
641520	649480	me to make auto hockey scripts on a computer that doesn't have auto hockey installed this allows
649480	657840	me to upload my dot AHK script to drop box by the way the AHK script will be unusable on
657880	666520	say a school computer and the home computer will recognize that files there and run it through
666520	674560	the AHK to exe converter so for the sake of demonstration because I'm sure that didn't make
674560	686920	too much sense I have got my tablet open and the files ready to go so I when this is running
687640	696040	every two minutes it will double click on this shortcut running it right now it links to something
696040	705480	that doesn't exist being remote dot AHK in this folder here okay I've set it so when I open up this
705480	712120	I'll have five seconds to react all the things are in place so remotely you'll place in code
712120	720840	dot AHK and remote dot AHK via the dropbox website and let's go
730360	738760	yes it's working so opens up the converter does that converts it and boom we're done here
739720	747560	let's close that and open up here code dot exe and now if I run that that opens up
749080	757160	the exact code that I put into the AHK file so this allows me to make scripts
758200	762520	remotely from anywhere provided that that loop is running on my computer
763080	770360	so if I say delete remote dot AHK and this shortcut won't do anything
772120	779640	and then if I bring it back from the dead which one is it I don't even know restore that one
781160	789640	then when I run this yet again it does all of that so that is auto hotkey in a nutshell
790440	796520	very useful program I really enjoy it it's giving me a lot more options with my keyboard
797240	802040	and with what I can do with my computer I could probably make a bot to do a specific
802040	809000	thing in a game if I so wanted so yes thanks for sticking around if you've made it this far into
809000	816280	the video which I doubt any of you have like if you like subscribe if you want more and that will be
816280	821880	me for this video see you guys ice out
