00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:14,760
Hello and welcome and in this video I'm going to be explaining why Auto Hockey is just the

2
00:00:14,760 --> 00:00:18,120
greatest program ever.

3
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:26,360
It's great for customization and accessibility because it allows you to make your own scripts

4
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:29,600
that do lots of stuff.

5
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:37,240
So I'll be showcasing a few of my scripts here like this one.

6
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:48,080
This says when I press Alt, Ctrl Alt and X it will type out all of those texts and

7
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:49,080
press Enter.

8
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:55,520
So I drag over Discord here and go on to a private server where I can just test this.

9
00:00:55,520 --> 00:01:03,240
I've pressed Ctrl Alt X and it is typing out stuff for a giveaway I've been doing

10
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:06,160
on a few servers.

11
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:16,760
So I can make macros and automatic typing and auto clickers, stuff like that.

12
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:19,960
So that's very useful for that kind of things.

13
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:25,080
This is an auto correct for text language.

14
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:32,760
So whatever I type, whenever I type the stuff between the colons it will expand into the

15
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:37,880
full version or get smaller if you so wanted it to.

16
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:46,020
So I've got this to add in the apostrophes for me, capitalise the eyes, expand text language.

17
00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:51,800
This will be very good for school because it means I can type in text language at school

18
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:55,720
and it will auto correct into proper English.

19
00:01:55,720 --> 00:02:02,040
So I will run this now and test it out.

20
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:13,160
Now I've got U expands into that, 4 expands into that and this is completely customisable.

21
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:15,840
So you can do this for whatever you want.

22
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:22,680
I think somewhere on the internet a guy has made a complete auto correct for this that

23
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:27,560
can be used in any application and that's quite cool.

24
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:31,800
So I'll close the auto correct for now.

25
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:35,720
This one works like the last one did.

26
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:44,360
When I press some certain buttons it will input the text into a game.

27
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:54,440
So I use this for role playing in Freelancer which I will open up now to show you how it

28
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:55,440
works.

29
00:02:55,440 --> 00:03:04,200
So here for a demonstration when I press shift enter it will open chat and type in Genre Toric

30
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:09,520
which is one of my role play characters on the Discovery Freelancer role play server and

31
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:13,920
I can type my message after that and fit in with the role play.

32
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:21,520
Control enter and type in Tee Samburgh which is another one of my characters and alt enter

33
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:27,200
types in Andrew which is another character Andrew Sanderson.

34
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:32,920
Another use for it is when you are stuck in a game and it's crashed but you can't get

35
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:37,040
your mouse out of the window even if you hit the windows key and stuff.

36
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:42,440
So when the windows menu opens up you can search for what run chrome and it will run

37
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:46,680
this simple thing which runs the website google.com.

38
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:51,760
That's useful because when you press the windows key even if you can't use your mouse you can

39
00:03:51,760 --> 00:04:00,400
write run chrome and I'll give you the script press enter and chrome will open up taking

40
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:04,960
your mouse out of the window it's stuck in.

41
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:10,120
This in theory toggles hidden files on your system.

42
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:15,600
I didn't write this code and I don't really know how it works.

43
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:25,720
Now on startup I have this setup when the computer boots up startupprograms.ahk opens

44
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:32,600
and that will wait 30 seconds for the computer to orientate itself and start to wake up properly

45
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:40,240
and it will run steam it will wait another 30 seconds and run discord and then wait one

46
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:49,960
second and it will run the first code here lock keys it will wait half a second run remap

47
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:57,920
hide and it will wait another second and write multi clipboard and then it will run dropbox

48
00:04:57,920 --> 00:04:58,920
in the background.

49
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:04,960
It cuts back on a lot of the computer's stress at the start because it waits before opening

50
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:10,000
all the programs rather than trying to open them all at once the moment you log in.

51
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:16,240
So now I'll show you the code to these and then how that ties into these shortcuts and

52
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:18,080
startup programs properly.

53
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:27,400
The lock keys script is very useful what this does is it disables the caps lock the number

54
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:33,720
lock and the scroll lock permanently setting their positions so if I press the caps lock

55
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:40,640
and unlock the scroll lock buttons now it won't toggle the function and that's very

56
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:47,840
useful in games and stuff because that means I can assign the keys to do other stuff and

57
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:52,080
always have it set in the right state for what I want.

58
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:59,320
This one is two different programs that were combined this top bit I didn't write myself

59
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:06,560
I downloaded it but I understand most of how it works basically what it does is when I

60
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:14,480
press the left control and the now disabled caps lock button it will hide Google Chrome

61
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:20,280
now that doesn't mean that it's minimized that means it's completely hidden it doesn't

62
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:30,360
even appear on your taskbar taskbar sorry and when I press the left shift and caps lock

63
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:39,120
it will appear again so I think it is active right now so I will demonstrate Google Chrome

64
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:46,480
is open control caps lock completely gone not even there but then we'll shift caps lock

65
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:52,160
I can bring it straight back and to prove that that wasn't me opening and reopening it

66
00:06:52,160 --> 00:07:04,040
let's go on to a random website I visited recently close open very simple now the other

67
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:10,440
thing that this code does is it remaps some of my buttons I have a button that launches

68
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:18,880
the calculator app on my keyboard which is launch app 2 and I've this remaps the key

69
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:26,680
to F13 you can have up to 24 function keys so I thought why not just have some more function

70
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:33,280
keys I can use for whatever I want so now my calculator button acts as F13 my scroll

71
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:43,000
lock button is F14 my media play pause button that plays and pauses media although only works

72
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:50,000
with Windows media player and the like so I never use it that acts as F15 caps lock is

73
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:59,440
F16 so I can assign caps lock to functions and games the menu button which is that weird

74
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:07,880
one between the right alt and right control I've remand that F17 and the divide and times

75
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:16,040
buttons on the numpad so I've set them to run the symbols so the divided by button will

76
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:25,120
do that and the times button will do that pretty simple this script I don't entirely

77
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:32,160
understand but it gives me three different clipboards so I can copy and paste three different

78
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:38,880
things at the same time not quite sure how this works but it does so I have a clipboard

79
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:44,200
for control C and control V I have one for Windows C and Windows V and I have one for

80
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:54,280
alt C and alt V so here if I get the word clipboard copied under control C and get the

81
00:08:54,280 --> 00:09:04,000
word until copied under Windows C and get the word old under alt C now if I press all

82
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:16,160
of the pace that was control V Windows V alt V very useful indeed now all of those have

83
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:24,120
to be ran as admin to work in any app which is where these shortcuts come in so start

84
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:33,520
up programs.hk is running these shortcuts here not the exe file what those shortcuts do is

85
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:46,600
they run a thing in task scheduler so remap hide runs this here multi clipboard runs this

86
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:54,080
task here and lock keys runs this task here they're allowed to run with highest privileges

87
00:09:54,080 --> 00:10:01,560
which means well it runs as admin without the pop-up box requiring you to click yes

88
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:10,600
and no and all that jazz and those run these as admin like I just said like this one allows

89
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:19,000
me to drag Windows around by holding the alt key like in Linux so right now I'm holding

90
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:25,640
down alt and I'm dragging it from anywhere I want it's not flawless it doesn't work on

91
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:33,880
maximize Windows but as you're about to see it works on full screen which is a bit of a

92
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:41,520
problem so I don't use it anymore now we come to what I consider my masterpiece this allows

93
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:49,480
me to make auto hockey scripts on a computer that doesn't have auto hockey installed this allows

94
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:57,840
me to upload my dot AHK script to drop box by the way the AHK script will be unusable on

95
00:10:57,880 --> 00:11:06,520
say a school computer and the home computer will recognize that files there and run it through

96
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:14,560
the AHK to exe converter so for the sake of demonstration because I'm sure that didn't make

97
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:26,920
too much sense I have got my tablet open and the files ready to go so I when this is running

98
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:36,040
every two minutes it will double click on this shortcut running it right now it links to something

99
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:45,480
that doesn't exist being remote dot AHK in this folder here okay I've set it so when I open up this

100
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:52,120
I'll have five seconds to react all the things are in place so remotely you'll place in code

101
00:11:52,120 --> 00:12:00,840
dot AHK and remote dot AHK via the dropbox website and let's go

102
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:18,760
yes it's working so opens up the converter does that converts it and boom we're done here

103
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:27,560
let's close that and open up here code dot exe and now if I run that that opens up

104
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:37,160
the exact code that I put into the AHK file so this allows me to make scripts

105
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:42,520
remotely from anywhere provided that that loop is running on my computer

106
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:50,360
so if I say delete remote dot AHK and this shortcut won't do anything

107
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:59,640
and then if I bring it back from the dead which one is it I don't even know restore that one

108
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:09,640
then when I run this yet again it does all of that so that is auto hotkey in a nutshell

109
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:16,520
very useful program I really enjoy it it's giving me a lot more options with my keyboard

110
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:22,040
and with what I can do with my computer I could probably make a bot to do a specific

111
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:29,000
thing in a game if I so wanted so yes thanks for sticking around if you've made it this far into

112
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:36,280
the video which I doubt any of you have like if you like subscribe if you want more and that will be

113
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:41,880
me for this video see you guys ice out
