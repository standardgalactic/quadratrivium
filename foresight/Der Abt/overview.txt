Processing Overview for Der Abt
============================
Checking Der Abt/Control Train Simulator with a MidiPad - MidiKey2Key has new features!.txt
1. **Keyboard Delay Issue**: If you're experiencing crashes with media keyboard programs due to a missing keyboard delay, you can resolve this by creating a new settings file in MediaKeyToKey. This is because the program will create a new settings file if it doesn't find an existing one, and it will use a default keyboard delay of 100 milliseconds, which should prevent crashes.

2. **Creating a New Settings File**: To start fresh with no pre-existing settings, you should either delete or rename your existing settings file in the MediaKeyToKey folder within your Documents directory. Upon starting the program again, it will generate a new settings file with default settings.

3. **Editing Existing Actions**: If you have an existing setup in Train Simulator or another game and want to make changes without losing your current settings, you should first save the entire set of actions as a new setting. This way, any changes you make will be saved into the new setting file and won't affect your original configuration.

4. **VBS Script for Media Events**: The script provided is for creating a sequence of media events in Windows using VBS. It requires selecting a device, setting a pause duration between events, choosing an extension (like red or green light), and then executing the script to create a sequence that can be copied to the clipboard.

5. **Using the Script**: The script is used to set up a series of events with adjustable delays and can be applied to any device recognized by the media keyboard program. You can create custom sequences for different lighting or media scenarios, copy them to the clipboard, and then paste them into your media keyboard software to execute.

6. **Script Limitations**: The VBS script provided has limitations, such as not being able to directly manipulate the clipboard since VBS does not have built-in clipboard commands. It uses Internet Explorer as an intermediary to place the results into the clipboard.

7. **Downloading the Script**: The script can be downloaded from the provided URLs or from the comments section of the website. It's a simple tool for creating media event sequences that can be applied to devices like the APC Halo.

Remember, always ensure you have a backup of your existing settings before making changes, and save new configurations as separate files to avoid losing valuable customizations.

Checking Der Abt/Switch scenes in OBS or lower your gear in FSX by MIDI with a new tool MidiKey2Key.txt
 Certainly! If you've acquired a MIDI pad from eBay for $15 and are interested in using it to control software like OBS (Open Broadcaster Software) for tasks such as switching scenes, you'll need to follow several steps to get everything set up and working together. Here's a summary of the process:

1. **Understand Your MIDI Pad**: First, familiarize yourself with your MIDI pad. Read the manual to understand its capabilities, how to connect it to your computer, and what each button or pad does by default.

2. **Install Drivers**: Make sure that your MIDI pad is properly connected to your computer via USB (or whatever connection type it uses) and that the necessary drivers are installed. These drivers will allow your computer to recognize the MIDI pad as a controller.

3. **Install OBS**: If you haven't already, install OBS on your computer. This is the software you'll use to manage your live streaming or recording.

4. **Set Up MIDI in OBS**:
   - Open OBS.
   - Go to `Settings` > `Hotkeys` and set up global hotkeys for scene transitions. You can also assign specific hotkeys to each scene by right-clicking on the scene in the main OBS window and selecting `Properties`.
   - In the same Hotkeys settings, under the `MIDI/Virtual Devices` tab, you'll need to configure OBS to listen for MIDI inputs. Select your MIDI pad from the dropdown list of available devices.

5. **Map MIDI Controls**:
   - Use the software that came with your MIDI pad (if available) or a general MIDI mapping tool like `AutoHotkey`, `MIDI-OX`, or `Lemurata` to map specific MIDI notes, control changes, or other inputs from your pad to the actions in OBS you want to trigger.
   - For example, you might map a certain drum pad on your MIDI pad to send a MIDI note that corresponds to the hotkey for switching to a different scene in OBS.

6. **Test Your Setup**: Before going live, test your setup thoroughly. Make sure that pressing the desired pads or buttons on your MIDI pad triggers the correct actions in OBS without any delay or unintended behavior.

7. **Go Live**: Once everything is mapped and tested, you can use your MIDI pad to control OBS during your live streams or recordings. You'll be able to switch scenes, start/stop recording, and potentially even control other aspects of your broadcast directly from your MIDI pad.

8. **Record and Practice**: Before attempting to use the MIDI pad in a live situation, practice using it with OBS in a test stream or while recording so you can get used to the feel and response time of the hardware.

Remember that the exact steps may vary depending on the make and model of your MIDI pad and any additional software you use for mapping. Always consult the documentation for both your MIDI pad and OBS for specific instructions related to your setup.
