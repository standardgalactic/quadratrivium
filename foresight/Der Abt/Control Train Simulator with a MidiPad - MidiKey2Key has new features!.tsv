0	8840	hi friends as you can see I'm controlling train simulator with a midi pad from
8840	17280	Akai, here's the gas station is coming
31600	34800	press the horn
39600	43000	hit the brake
50680	54000	I'm already slow
55360	65920	I'm not the best train driver by the way as you can see okay let's come to a stop
69160	81240	and open the doors with this one wait for the stop
81240	85520	doors are opening
85520	94720	turn off the wiper no wrong button sorry this is the interface down here
94720	101120	the HUD
101120	107840	where is it don't remember
107840	113440	well the direction lever
116240	123760	the brake is not applied in this kind of train and the fuse
124720	143000	this I forgot also okay how can this be done just watch this video
154720	173760	first of all many thanks for your feedback and your suggestions of the for
173760	178480	the initial version of midi key to key now this here is the magical thing and
178480	184520	if you never heard about midi key to key make sure you watch the first video
184520	192280	that tells you the basic use of that program for now I'm show you the version
192280	201160	1.9 with many new features and bug fixes and let's talk about quickly about the
201160	213200	bug fixes I have a title and activated by OBS the bug fixes so there is all these
213200	222040	small things the channel is in this here one two sixteen they did not save but
222040	228720	nobody complained it I found it and now they are saved in the settings and the
228720	237960	second thing is if you have an action and react on the second value it's used
237960	245400	rarely normally you only react on the first value the first data value this
245400	249840	was not storage it didn't work but nobody complained because you won't use it
249840	266920	very often so now what's new the great new features yeah where to start with okay
266920	274280	um you have had one settings file your settings in you that stored all your
274600	281080	settings and the settings of the actions the key actions the midi actions now you
281080	286440	have multiple actions if you start midi key to key the first time it's just stores
286440	294400	automatically it settings the settings any in your documents folder and that's
294560	308120	it now you can have several in ease or settings file and where are they in the
308120	314520	file menu you can now load a custom a different settings file here we are
314520	319720	documents your username documents midi key to key you can load a different
319720	326960	setting and save as a different setting you don't need to type any in the end it
326960	334440	does it automatically they all need to be here to be found automatically and then
334440	343280	second new feature is you can start up midi key to key with a special settings
343280	358880	file if you have a shortcut like this just add at the end a name of a path my
358920	375840	setting any if it has white spaces you need to surround to surround it okay so now
375840	379600	it will load my setting this file is not existing this is an example but you can
380400	383520	you can easily create a shortcut like this
386960	391920	and it starts at your desktop and name will be
396640	405760	for example new setting so and as you can see it made a shortcut and called it new setting and
406720	415840	yeah it sets the actual any file and this is the default right now as you can see in the
415840	426880	headline the top line of the program settings any therefore it just says settings okay so
427200	437040	multiple settings files the next thing is since I'm using this archive path apc mini
438240	445520	this one has the feature to let the buttons light up which the cork nanopad didn't have
446320	454400	and well it needs to receive midi commands to light up the buttons in that case it
454400	462160	wants to have note on events and you can have three colors green red and yellow and
463120	473760	same blinking and you can send turn it off so midi key to key needed to send out midi here we are
475760	483040	now you can choose the output device for sending out midi commands this is the old input and now
483040	493040	you need to have an output device and now when you have an action fired you can in addition of a
493040	502400	key command or start program action now define a midi command that is sent out and you can send
502400	509520	whatever you want I'll show you that later you even can send two different midi commands they
509520	519120	toggle each time you fire the action next thing is the mirror midi this is just a small feature
519120	527120	it mirrors the midi into the midi out in the case of the apc it does nothing because I need to push
527120	537840	the start button you see it mirrored my in command of that key and that lets the archive apc mini
538080	546160	turn on the green default light when I press it again nothing happens it stays now on at that
546160	558960	state that's the mirror out that's new um yeah besides the edit the action the action that you
558960	564960	choose here besides this now you have a test button you can test
567440	573360	your action let's start the text editor to see what's happening
577520	581280	let's test the the view button from the train simulator
582160	592000	I have to now the problem is if I push the test button with the mouse the editor loses now
594720	601200	the focus and you don't see the letter I'm typing then let's go to yeah
601360	608480	this action that
611520	612320	as you can see
615280	625120	that pushed an action to obs now that's for testing that's new and also new is now these
625200	633040	these the name or as it was shown the actions was the the midi bytes
634480	644880	and now apc 8 4 is my reminder this is 8 4 is this knob and now you can name your action it's down here
646880	654800	whatever you want hit save and the name will appear now in this list you can now better
654880	657600	find actions if you have a lot like this
660560	663360	now next new thing is
668800	675360	if you have a start program action watch the first video to check this out
676000	682320	now you can choose the state of the action of the program started normal is just a normal
682320	691120	window max is the max window maximized and minimized and or even hidden these four states
691120	699200	you can store and the program that you want to start by an action will have this window state
700320	711280	some users want to fire up a command a box like cnd or let's define a new
711280	716880	action uh let's take the top here
720640	729440	I call this round right one I'll find it at the test that's the first thing and
729600	733600	um we're gonna have a program action
736400	744000	command window the working directory needed and this is the command
748800	755360	do you now first in normal state save okay now hit this one
755600	764400	this is opening the window in the normal state I'll edit this action
767360	768240	maximized
773360	780560	is maximized as you can see well and you can believe me the other actions
780560	788000	uh minimized or even hidden are also working but you won't see anything
790320	801040	let's turn that off so and if you now have a send media action defined um the program
801040	809120	works now as a universal media converter it it listens to a special input media event and then
809120	816960	sends out any media out command or even sequences as long as you wish of media commands
818000	825600	this is done with this new tab send midi and there are many controls but it's easy to handle
827280	833280	first of all activated now this is still our test button
833280	846640	uh to light this up I know it's 90 52 this is the note on and the number of this
848320	855360	and now zero one makes it green the round buttons I believe they are only can be green
855360	864080	and these only can be red so the other will have zero one up to zero six for the decolors and blink
864080	875120	and not blink so now the media command I put in is 90 52 zero one that's it it all will be sent
875120	883040	all the time so this would be would have an effect just on the first time because it stays now on
885920	888960	you won't see difference for this
893520	900320	I have a toggle section B is a command that will be executed the next time
902080	907360	so 90 52 zero to turn it off
910080	912400	off on off on
916000	922800	so these buttons here are defined to change the
925280	932800	the fuse of train simulator and these to change the scenes of OBS you see this one becomes red
933920	942000	and the active one is green blinking now this needs when pressing this an action of seven
942480	949200	commands that makes them all steady green and this one blinking
952160	953920	I have this in the
957280	957920	eight one
960800	961520	eight one
965840	967200	so this is the command
968160	977680	you see they are all to five in the end except the first one is the three
979280	984960	second time is not defined it's only the first time and then if we check all the others
986720	987600	where's the A2
989840	990320	anyway
990800	994880	they are all five to
997040	999040	oh no this is this one here
1001760	1003120	it's the few two
1008000	1012720	they're all set to one except now the second one is set to two to make it blink like this
1013120	1023200	so if we edit then our test button here up in the corner again
1026800	1032560	this is what you can do just by typing any commands and if you do a second command just one
1032560	1039280	space and please nothing else so this is executed very quickly
1039760	1042880	but if you want to wait
1045440	1050880	a little you can add a pause in milliseconds so let's say 300
1053840	1062320	oh no add now it adds this in the end it's just where you can cut this out oh well I messed it up
1063280	1069440	so like this it always puts commands in the end now it since this color command
1070400	1079360	means out off then wait 300 milliseconds and then turn on the green light again check it out
1087440	1088000	doesn't work
1093280	1098800	why is this not working
1108480	1114000	oh push the totally wrong number 52
1123280	1126480	it turns on after 300 milliseconds
1128480	1131840	you can create sequences of
1133920	1140080	hundreds of commands with a pause in between so you could turn the whole matrix of lights into
1140080	1147040	showing letters and scrolling left to right and then create light shows just for fun
1147440	1154640	so if you won't use the input pad manually by typing in hex commands you see now it's only
1154640	1163360	numbers but it's still bytes of hex so after the 9 comes 9a, 9b, 9c and so on
1166560	1169600	you can route the last or
1169840	1178160	or oh I hit the save thing now or remove everything
1183920	1192160	oh this was not a really not a command
1200480	1202720	so just type in
1207840	1214800	rr is a wallet command to remove last or clear all so if you won't
1215920	1224720	don't like to type in manually you can use these input boxes now note on is the first thing
1225440	1229280	and you can if you know the hex value of a key
1231440	1237520	you can just use this or choose the key down here
1238800	1245200	note on and then note on needs another value if you push add please enter a value this is the
1245200	1252960	velocity 25 add so then let's turn this note on or just
1256880	1258000	let it sound for
1261520	1264320	half a second and then turn it off
1264320	1272720	off needs no data but it doesn't matter
1274720	1279360	so and that's it this will play is c3 for half a second and turn it off
1281200	1281840	so now
1285520	1291120	let's stop this and use the wave table synthesizer and I'm not sure if you hear it now in the video
1291120	1292320	just give it a try
1295440	1296000	you hear that
1301200	1305120	yeah so you can even play
1308240	1309280	songs at this
1311440	1318640	so this is not on not off the most common things you will use but you can send everything and if
1318720	1324720	you know something just type it in sys x commands are not included here
1327520	1334080	another thing is channel mode messages these are preformed all nodes off
1335040	1342000	would be this command it doesn't need any data so this is disabled local on off
1342960	1350000	reset all controllers omnimode on off it's just without any data fields it is built in command
1351520	1358880	polyphonic after touch these these types need to have which node do you press and
1359840	1366320	how strong is the after touch the monophonic after touch channel after touch only needs
1366400	1372960	how much is the whole keyboard to press and after touch there are many media controls possible
1372960	1382000	control changes are very huge in number some require two
1384560	1392400	two commands in a row some require a 14 bit data or the most of them require seven bit data
1392960	1402000	um midi key to key just takes anything you type in up to 127
1404160	1413920	so everything will not make sense you need to be an expert for midi to know what you do but
1413920	1419360	as you can see if you know about midi you can do a lot with this or just type anything
1420160	1427520	in manually here add pauses in between with this field or by typing p and whatever
1428640	1435840	a number of milliseconds this is now media out the main job is to light up
1436880	1444640	midi controllers by sending a command to it to have a reflection what you are doing like this
1445200	1457200	changing scenes in obias or whatever this is the great new feature and um yeah many users ask
1457200	1465280	me about what about controllers like these like faders or turning knobs um and i respond
1465280	1473520	that well this is a thing they need to fire out many midi um commands in a row
1474720	1480480	on i don't know how to do it or will it make sense and as you could see in the uh
1481280	1490080	intro video it is working and this is maybe one of the best new features now you can
1490640	1499920	send um a response to a controller and fire up key commands it just fires key commands as you can see
1503120	1509440	this controls the the gas of the train a for plus and default minus and as you can see
1510480	1517440	yeah it even works on this window we won't save this now how is this been done
1517600	1527520	done define a new one let's take this you start this is the one two three four five the fifth
1528080	1534960	controller just move it and double click now on the event it created
1535680	1540800	i recommend giving it a name
1544240	1553440	fader five so it sends keystrokes yes and uh you just put the first keystrokes it
1553440	1561760	it will send when you increase the lever um yeah let's just send a q or shift q
1562240	1574800	and now hit the controller action box and now the the response is brought to the second this is the
1575760	1582560	value for decrement a controller value so now again press the blue button and press your
1583360	1593520	other action as you can see this is now coming here if you want to change this again you can
1593520	1599120	just type in anything manually but you know when you want to use the blue thing it's always
1599840	1607600	when this checkbox is on it will manipulate this input box so turn it off
1607600	1619520	and change it here when you turn this checkbox again off your shift w is not lost so this is just
1621360	1628160	the easy thing now you have two keys to find this will be fired when the new value of
1628720	1635040	by moving a controller is higher and if you move the controller the controller
1635680	1642480	fader down the new value is lower and then the shift w is fired now
1644640	1653520	this two things are very important the keyboard delay is 100 does a good job on
1653600	1664880	uh just controlling programs and some users told me obs studio is not responding to
1664880	1674640	midi key to key and uh only when it has the focus and when you use your keyboard it works even as
1674640	1683120	if it has not the focus so i found out if you have a very low keyboard delay value you can
1683120	1695520	even set this to zero that means key pressed down and up uh in the same moment um my obs studio is
1695520	1705200	responding at about 40 and 50 milliseconds so and if you go lower with the keyboard delay
1706160	1714480	it will just respond on any actions when it is in focus so that's a performance problem
1715360	1722400	and our system is not different now when we want to have a controller action like this put it down
1722400	1733040	all the way first of all check zero and leave the multiplier to one that means the controller
1733600	1734240	will have
1738000	1748080	127 values from the bottom to the top and the multiplier to set to one fires up 127
1748800	1757440	times the key press so one to one with no delay save this and check it out if now set the focus
1757440	1770640	to the editor and move the fader see i put in a new line fader down creates w
1773440	1779680	so and then if you set the delay to zero this reacts very quickly
1779840	1783680	so
1786400	1791120	but if you want to control a game it's different
1793360	1800880	how they respond train simulator is special it needs a little longer key press to react to
1800880	1808320	to move the gas lever and so i put this to 10 that's a thing you can experiment with
1809360	1815920	it even works on as just a single key press no controller action
1818480	1828560	you can type in a value then then let's the key down for this time you put in
1828560	1836480	before it releases to to make a key press longer but there's a problem i don't know why so far
1836480	1843040	if you put it too high over a second or something the program will not longer respond i don't know
1843040	1849760	what it is maybe it can be fixed in the future but i think it's not really important to have this
1849760	1859520	right now so the keyboard delay let's see when you put it to 10 what will be the difference
1864480	1868960	now 10 doesn't really make a difference let's put it a little longer
1879760	1882960	set it to 80
1891760	1899120	see you really won't don't want that by controlling any software but
1900640	1903040	who knows you might need it
1903040	1912560	always start with a zero and the keyboard events will be fired up immediately
1914000	1919040	so the second thing is a multiplier and that's still experimental
1920240	1924080	because i can't really do anything i want to
1924640	1938160	as mentioned the the midi standard is 127 values but if you have a lever in a software that has
1938160	1951840	only five or six different states to control you will set the multiplier lower let's say to
1951840	1959040	1.2 and this is not a point it's point or comma depending of your country i'm in germany so i
1959040	1971520	need to type in a comma so i have the multiplier lower than one and now this is the max
1974960	1975520	you see it
1975520	1988000	it cuts the maximum numbers set it to 0.1
1993680	2000480	it cuts the amount always in half and that's the only thing it can do because it has to count
2000480	2013760	the the input events as you can see they are coming single one by one and it has just to count
2015360	2021440	10 times to wait now never fire up another keyboard action so you cannot have
2025280	2028320	you cannot have everywhere you you wish
2030800	2037360	last test of this zero zero one
2042160	2044160	yeah it's just produces one
2047280	2057440	okay if you want to have more than 170 events you only can double or times four times three times
2057520	2065440	four times five you cannot do one point five times you can send an event or you cannot send you
2065440	2078320	cannot send half of an event so let's put this to three and it will produce three times of 127
2078880	2087680	so and uh different software is different but you can control
2089040	2091920	any software with it that responds on key presses
2094560	2097120	um oops i'm sorry
2100400	2100960	a crash
2109200	2115760	i wanted to press the edit button i don't know why it quite crashed need to check this out
2117280	2125520	um so set the multiplier to one and you will have a one to one respond on your
2126320	2135680	on your lever or for your controller set it lower than zero point five will only produce
2136320	2145120	about 66 key events and put it higher in whole numbers not 1.5 1.7 just one two three
2146560	2152640	will produce uh two times three times four times of the maximum
2155040	2162880	so i hope now that's it the new controller actions
2163840	2168960	controller actions we talked about sending media
2173680	2179920	yeah if you use an old version of media key to key and you use your old settings any
2180800	2188000	they did not have the keyboard delay value so if you just use it open it up and and use your
2188320	2196320	um media pad the program will crash because it doesn't have the keyboard delay in your old
2196320	2206720	any so if you do so create a new any start at zero i show you this right now how this can be done
2206720	2217600	um start at zero then everything will be fine um or take your existing any in that case
2217600	2228480	is as much open any every action with edit it will get a default of 100 decided if this is okay or
2228480	2237600	not and hit save if you do do it with all your actions it they will have then a keyboard delay
2237600	2244720	and the program will not crash as i said uh start fresh
2248160	2257760	will be like this go into your documents folder and let me get an explorer
2258480	2267600	uh and rename or delete your existing settings any
2271040	2277600	in the media key to key folder it's here because if it turns see
2277600	2290960	if it doesn't see any settings see it will create a new one and also i take this my setting that is
2290960	2297040	well it was all the time saying i can't find my settings sure it doesn't exist without any
2297120	2310400	part so start up media key to key and best practice is to start it up and close it then a new settings
2310400	2324400	any is generated and from then you can start making actions it's also recommended if you
2325200	2332400	have an existing let's open the existing the strain simulator thing has some actions
2334960	2347520	and you decide to to do a new game or whatever um and you edit stuff like this and changing things
2347520	2356480	and hit save and then say and save all of this as a new setting you can do that but remember now
2356480	2363040	the the settings name that's here written in the top line train simulator is already changed on all
2363040	2372240	the actions because you hit save anytime you edit an action and hit save this setting is written
2372240	2383040	into the actual settings file so when you want to build up a new setting based on let's say this one
2384080	2391280	at first hit save as and then start editing the actions that's the better practice and you won't
2391280	2400080	lose the settings of your actions in the old file so that's it for now all the
2404640	2411200	important URLs will be shown down there for download and for the other video for the basic
2412240	2419680	video which i recommend to watch first and the home page for download and for your
2419680	2430400	respondings okay um this is the script i can't provide it well it's very simple um
2436080	2447200	this just does the uh mix 64 media events for the akai um this down here is just
2447920	2455920	for to have the created sequence in the clipboard and this is a little weird vbs don't have any
2455920	2469200	clipboard commands so it uses internet explorer who now runs the script and then put the result in
2469200	2479760	the clipboard and therefore this is all the code down here um the script here just creates the events
2480720	2489680	you can say set pause to one or zero that means will i have a pause in between the events zero one
2489680	2495120	how long the pause is in milliseconds and then decide what extension do you want to have
2496080	2504880	and uh i think this is red and out um no it's nothing so these three
2506720	2509760	extension is the last value
2515360	2520480	so if i run the script now it sets a pause of 75 milliseconds in between all the
2521440	2532960	the events and uh that sets all the lights of the apc to three let's create quickly a new event
2535920	2542320	oh no device is selected because i started with a completely new um
2543200	2549840	um yeah then take this little square button which does not have a light
2552480	2559920	start press it once take the note off and the note on event um do nothing
2560560	2570880	just take this send midi and where's the script now let's run the script set to one
2572560	2574800	pause one oh there it is
2579520	2584640	here's the result and at the same moment this is put into your clipboard so
2585360	2591360	paste it in and delete the last pause
2594080	2599440	okay then put it to be to turn all the lights off with a
2602080	2612560	lower pause value it goes quickly more quickly 15 and zero save
2615440	2616960	start
2619520	2623280	i do not know why this takes so long and sometimes oh there it is
2626800	2635760	it's only because of the the clipboard you could know you cannot copy this therefore
2635760	2641360	you need the clipboard anyway now we paste in this delete the last pause
2641920	2650640	p15 and that's it now we have these two sets and what will happen let's have a look right here
2657600	2664480	it turns on all the red lights with the pause of 75 milliseconds in between when we hit
2664560	2668880	the second time it removes them but quicker because of the lower pause
2671200	2679120	so you can create your pictures this little script if you want to download it i don't know
2679120	2685520	it's just a little thing to me right in the comments of the website
2686480	2690240	or down here but i like more the website
2690240	2702080	okay that's it thanks for watching see you next time bye
