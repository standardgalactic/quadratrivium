1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,840
hi friends as you can see I'm controlling train simulator with a midi pad from

2
00:00:08,840 --> 00:00:17,280
Akai, here's the gas station is coming

3
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:34,800
press the horn

4
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:43,000
hit the brake

5
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:54,000
I'm already slow

6
00:00:55,360 --> 00:01:05,920
I'm not the best train driver by the way as you can see okay let's come to a stop

7
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:21,240
and open the doors with this one wait for the stop

8
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:25,520
doors are opening

9
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:34,720
turn off the wiper no wrong button sorry this is the interface down here

10
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:41,120
the HUD

11
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:47,840
where is it don't remember

12
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:53,440
well the direction lever

13
00:01:56,240 --> 00:02:03,760
the brake is not applied in this kind of train and the fuse

14
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:23,000
this I forgot also okay how can this be done just watch this video

15
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:53,760
first of all many thanks for your feedback and your suggestions of the for

16
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:58,480
the initial version of midi key to key now this here is the magical thing and

17
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:04,520
if you never heard about midi key to key make sure you watch the first video

18
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:12,280
that tells you the basic use of that program for now I'm show you the version

19
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:21,160
1.9 with many new features and bug fixes and let's talk about quickly about the

20
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:33,200
bug fixes I have a title and activated by OBS the bug fixes so there is all these

21
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:42,040
small things the channel is in this here one two sixteen they did not save but

22
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:48,720
nobody complained it I found it and now they are saved in the settings and the

23
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:57,960
second thing is if you have an action and react on the second value it's used

24
00:03:57,960 --> 00:04:05,400
rarely normally you only react on the first value the first data value this

25
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:09,840
was not storage it didn't work but nobody complained because you won't use it

26
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:26,920
very often so now what's new the great new features yeah where to start with okay

27
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:34,280
um you have had one settings file your settings in you that stored all your

28
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:41,080
settings and the settings of the actions the key actions the midi actions now you

29
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:46,440
have multiple actions if you start midi key to key the first time it's just stores

30
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:54,400
automatically it settings the settings any in your documents folder and that's

31
00:04:54,560 --> 00:05:08,120
it now you can have several in ease or settings file and where are they in the

32
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:14,520
file menu you can now load a custom a different settings file here we are

33
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:19,720
documents your username documents midi key to key you can load a different

34
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:26,960
setting and save as a different setting you don't need to type any in the end it

35
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:34,440
does it automatically they all need to be here to be found automatically and then

36
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:43,280
second new feature is you can start up midi key to key with a special settings

37
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:58,880
file if you have a shortcut like this just add at the end a name of a path my

38
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:15,840
setting any if it has white spaces you need to surround to surround it okay so now

39
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:19,600
it will load my setting this file is not existing this is an example but you can

40
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:23,520
you can easily create a shortcut like this

41
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:31,920
and it starts at your desktop and name will be

42
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:45,760
for example new setting so and as you can see it made a shortcut and called it new setting and

43
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:55,840
yeah it sets the actual any file and this is the default right now as you can see in the

44
00:06:55,840 --> 00:07:06,880
headline the top line of the program settings any therefore it just says settings okay so

45
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:17,040
multiple settings files the next thing is since I'm using this archive path apc mini

46
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:25,520
this one has the feature to let the buttons light up which the cork nanopad didn't have

47
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:34,400
and well it needs to receive midi commands to light up the buttons in that case it

48
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:42,160
wants to have note on events and you can have three colors green red and yellow and

49
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:53,760
same blinking and you can send turn it off so midi key to key needed to send out midi here we are

50
00:07:55,760 --> 00:08:03,040
now you can choose the output device for sending out midi commands this is the old input and now

51
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:13,040
you need to have an output device and now when you have an action fired you can in addition of a

52
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:22,400
key command or start program action now define a midi command that is sent out and you can send

53
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:29,520
whatever you want I'll show you that later you even can send two different midi commands they

54
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:39,120
toggle each time you fire the action next thing is the mirror midi this is just a small feature

55
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:47,120
it mirrors the midi into the midi out in the case of the apc it does nothing because I need to push

56
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:57,840
the start button you see it mirrored my in command of that key and that lets the archive apc mini

57
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:06,160
turn on the green default light when I press it again nothing happens it stays now on at that

58
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:18,960
state that's the mirror out that's new um yeah besides the edit the action the action that you

59
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:24,960
choose here besides this now you have a test button you can test

60
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:33,360
your action let's start the text editor to see what's happening

61
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:41,280
let's test the the view button from the train simulator

62
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:52,000
I have to now the problem is if I push the test button with the mouse the editor loses now

63
00:09:54,720 --> 00:10:01,200
the focus and you don't see the letter I'm typing then let's go to yeah

64
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:08,480
this action that

65
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:12,320
as you can see

66
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:25,120
that pushed an action to obs now that's for testing that's new and also new is now these

67
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:33,040
these the name or as it was shown the actions was the the midi bytes

68
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:44,880
and now apc 8 4 is my reminder this is 8 4 is this knob and now you can name your action it's down here

69
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:54,800
whatever you want hit save and the name will appear now in this list you can now better

70
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:57,600
find actions if you have a lot like this

71
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:03,360
now next new thing is

72
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:15,360
if you have a start program action watch the first video to check this out

73
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:22,320
now you can choose the state of the action of the program started normal is just a normal

74
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:31,120
window max is the max window maximized and minimized and or even hidden these four states

75
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:39,200
you can store and the program that you want to start by an action will have this window state

76
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:51,280
some users want to fire up a command a box like cnd or let's define a new

77
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:56,880
action uh let's take the top here

78
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:09,440
I call this round right one I'll find it at the test that's the first thing and

79
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:13,600
um we're gonna have a program action

80
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:24,000
command window the working directory needed and this is the command

81
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:35,360
do you now first in normal state save okay now hit this one

82
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:44,400
this is opening the window in the normal state I'll edit this action

83
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:48,240
maximized

84
00:12:53,360 --> 00:13:00,560
is maximized as you can see well and you can believe me the other actions

85
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:08,000
uh minimized or even hidden are also working but you won't see anything

86
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:21,040
let's turn that off so and if you now have a send media action defined um the program

87
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:29,120
works now as a universal media converter it it listens to a special input media event and then

88
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:36,960
sends out any media out command or even sequences as long as you wish of media commands

89
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:45,600
this is done with this new tab send midi and there are many controls but it's easy to handle

90
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:53,280
first of all activated now this is still our test button

91
00:13:53,280 --> 00:14:06,640
uh to light this up I know it's 90 52 this is the note on and the number of this

92
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:15,360
and now zero one makes it green the round buttons I believe they are only can be green

93
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:24,080
and these only can be red so the other will have zero one up to zero six for the decolors and blink

94
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:35,120
and not blink so now the media command I put in is 90 52 zero one that's it it all will be sent

95
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:43,040
all the time so this would be would have an effect just on the first time because it stays now on

96
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:48,960
you won't see difference for this

97
00:14:53,520 --> 00:15:00,320
I have a toggle section B is a command that will be executed the next time

98
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:07,360
so 90 52 zero to turn it off

99
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:12,400
off on off on

100
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:22,800
so these buttons here are defined to change the

101
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:32,800
the fuse of train simulator and these to change the scenes of OBS you see this one becomes red

102
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:42,000
and the active one is green blinking now this needs when pressing this an action of seven

103
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:49,200
commands that makes them all steady green and this one blinking

104
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:53,920
I have this in the

105
00:15:57,280 --> 00:15:57,920
eight one

106
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:01,520
eight one

107
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:07,200
so this is the command

108
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:17,680
you see they are all to five in the end except the first one is the three

109
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:24,960
second time is not defined it's only the first time and then if we check all the others

110
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:27,600
where's the A2

111
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:30,320
anyway

112
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:34,880
they are all five to

113
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:39,040
oh no this is this one here

114
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:43,120
it's the few two

115
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:52,720
they're all set to one except now the second one is set to two to make it blink like this

116
00:16:53,120 --> 00:17:03,200
so if we edit then our test button here up in the corner again

117
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:12,560
this is what you can do just by typing any commands and if you do a second command just one

118
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:19,280
space and please nothing else so this is executed very quickly

119
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:22,880
but if you want to wait

120
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:30,880
a little you can add a pause in milliseconds so let's say 300

121
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:42,320
oh no add now it adds this in the end it's just where you can cut this out oh well I messed it up

122
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:49,440
so like this it always puts commands in the end now it since this color command

123
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:59,360
means out off then wait 300 milliseconds and then turn on the green light again check it out

124
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:08,000
doesn't work

125
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:18,800
why is this not working

126
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:34,000
oh push the totally wrong number 52

127
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:46,480
it turns on after 300 milliseconds

128
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:51,840
you can create sequences of

129
00:18:53,920 --> 00:19:00,080
hundreds of commands with a pause in between so you could turn the whole matrix of lights into

130
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:07,040
showing letters and scrolling left to right and then create light shows just for fun

131
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:14,640
so if you won't use the input pad manually by typing in hex commands you see now it's only

132
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:23,360
numbers but it's still bytes of hex so after the 9 comes 9a, 9b, 9c and so on

133
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:29,600
you can route the last or

134
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:38,160
or oh I hit the save thing now or remove everything

135
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:52,160
oh this was not a really not a command

136
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:02,720
so just type in

137
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:14,800
rr is a wallet command to remove last or clear all so if you won't

138
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:24,720
don't like to type in manually you can use these input boxes now note on is the first thing

139
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:29,280
and you can if you know the hex value of a key

140
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:37,520
you can just use this or choose the key down here

141
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:45,200
note on and then note on needs another value if you push add please enter a value this is the

142
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:52,960
velocity 25 add so then let's turn this note on or just

143
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:58,000
let it sound for

144
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:04,320
half a second and then turn it off

145
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:12,720
off needs no data but it doesn't matter

146
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:19,360
so and that's it this will play is c3 for half a second and turn it off

147
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:21,840
so now

148
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:31,120
let's stop this and use the wave table synthesizer and I'm not sure if you hear it now in the video

149
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:32,320
just give it a try

150
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:36,000
you hear that

151
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:45,120
yeah so you can even play

152
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:49,280
songs at this

153
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:58,640
so this is not on not off the most common things you will use but you can send everything and if

154
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:04,720
you know something just type it in sys x commands are not included here

155
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:14,080
another thing is channel mode messages these are preformed all nodes off

156
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:22,000
would be this command it doesn't need any data so this is disabled local on off

157
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:30,000
reset all controllers omnimode on off it's just without any data fields it is built in command

158
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:38,880
polyphonic after touch these these types need to have which node do you press and

159
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:46,320
how strong is the after touch the monophonic after touch channel after touch only needs

160
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:52,960
how much is the whole keyboard to press and after touch there are many media controls possible

161
00:22:52,960 --> 00:23:02,000
control changes are very huge in number some require two

162
00:23:04,560 --> 00:23:12,400
two commands in a row some require a 14 bit data or the most of them require seven bit data

163
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:22,000
um midi key to key just takes anything you type in up to 127

164
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:33,920
so everything will not make sense you need to be an expert for midi to know what you do but

165
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:39,360
as you can see if you know about midi you can do a lot with this or just type anything

166
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:47,520
in manually here add pauses in between with this field or by typing p and whatever

167
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:55,840
a number of milliseconds this is now media out the main job is to light up

168
00:23:56,880 --> 00:24:04,640
midi controllers by sending a command to it to have a reflection what you are doing like this

169
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:17,200
changing scenes in obias or whatever this is the great new feature and um yeah many users ask

170
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:25,280
me about what about controllers like these like faders or turning knobs um and i respond

171
00:24:25,280 --> 00:24:33,520
that well this is a thing they need to fire out many midi um commands in a row

172
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:40,480
on i don't know how to do it or will it make sense and as you could see in the uh

173
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:50,080
intro video it is working and this is maybe one of the best new features now you can

174
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:59,920
send um a response to a controller and fire up key commands it just fires key commands as you can see

175
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:09,440
this controls the the gas of the train a for plus and default minus and as you can see

176
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:17,440
yeah it even works on this window we won't save this now how is this been done

177
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:27,520
done define a new one let's take this you start this is the one two three four five the fifth

178
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:34,960
controller just move it and double click now on the event it created

179
00:25:35,680 --> 00:25:40,800
i recommend giving it a name

180
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:53,440
fader five so it sends keystrokes yes and uh you just put the first keystrokes it

181
00:25:53,440 --> 00:26:01,760
it will send when you increase the lever um yeah let's just send a q or shift q

182
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:14,800
and now hit the controller action box and now the the response is brought to the second this is the

183
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:22,560
value for decrement a controller value so now again press the blue button and press your

184
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:33,520
other action as you can see this is now coming here if you want to change this again you can

185
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:39,120
just type in anything manually but you know when you want to use the blue thing it's always

186
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:47,600
when this checkbox is on it will manipulate this input box so turn it off

187
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:59,520
and change it here when you turn this checkbox again off your shift w is not lost so this is just

188
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:08,160
the easy thing now you have two keys to find this will be fired when the new value of

189
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:15,040
by moving a controller is higher and if you move the controller the controller

190
00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:22,480
fader down the new value is lower and then the shift w is fired now

191
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:33,520
this two things are very important the keyboard delay is 100 does a good job on

192
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:44,880
uh just controlling programs and some users told me obs studio is not responding to

193
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:54,640
midi key to key and uh only when it has the focus and when you use your keyboard it works even as

194
00:27:54,640 --> 00:28:03,120
if it has not the focus so i found out if you have a very low keyboard delay value you can

195
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:15,520
even set this to zero that means key pressed down and up uh in the same moment um my obs studio is

196
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:25,200
responding at about 40 and 50 milliseconds so and if you go lower with the keyboard delay

197
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:34,480
it will just respond on any actions when it is in focus so that's a performance problem

198
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:42,400
and our system is not different now when we want to have a controller action like this put it down

199
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:53,040
all the way first of all check zero and leave the multiplier to one that means the controller

200
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:54,240
will have

201
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:08,080
127 values from the bottom to the top and the multiplier to set to one fires up 127

202
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:17,440
times the key press so one to one with no delay save this and check it out if now set the focus

203
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:30,640
to the editor and move the fader see i put in a new line fader down creates w

204
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:39,680
so and then if you set the delay to zero this reacts very quickly

205
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:43,680
so

206
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:51,120
but if you want to control a game it's different

207
00:29:53,360 --> 00:30:00,880
how they respond train simulator is special it needs a little longer key press to react to

208
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:08,320
to move the gas lever and so i put this to 10 that's a thing you can experiment with

209
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:15,920
it even works on as just a single key press no controller action

210
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:28,560
you can type in a value then then let's the key down for this time you put in

211
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:36,480
before it releases to to make a key press longer but there's a problem i don't know why so far

212
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:43,040
if you put it too high over a second or something the program will not longer respond i don't know

213
00:30:43,040 --> 00:30:49,760
what it is maybe it can be fixed in the future but i think it's not really important to have this

214
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:59,520
right now so the keyboard delay let's see when you put it to 10 what will be the difference

215
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:08,960
now 10 doesn't really make a difference let's put it a little longer

216
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:22,960
set it to 80

217
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:39,120
see you really won't don't want that by controlling any software but

218
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:43,040
who knows you might need it

219
00:31:43,040 --> 00:31:52,560
always start with a zero and the keyboard events will be fired up immediately

220
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:59,040
so the second thing is a multiplier and that's still experimental

221
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:04,080
because i can't really do anything i want to

222
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:18,160
as mentioned the the midi standard is 127 values but if you have a lever in a software that has

223
00:32:18,160 --> 00:32:31,840
only five or six different states to control you will set the multiplier lower let's say to

224
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:39,040
1.2 and this is not a point it's point or comma depending of your country i'm in germany so i

225
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:51,520
need to type in a comma so i have the multiplier lower than one and now this is the max

226
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:55,520
you see it

227
00:32:55,520 --> 00:33:08,000
it cuts the maximum numbers set it to 0.1

228
00:33:13,680 --> 00:33:20,480
it cuts the amount always in half and that's the only thing it can do because it has to count

229
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:33,760
the the input events as you can see they are coming single one by one and it has just to count

230
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:41,440
10 times to wait now never fire up another keyboard action so you cannot have

231
00:33:45,280 --> 00:33:48,320
you cannot have everywhere you you wish

232
00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:57,360
last test of this zero zero one

233
00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:04,160
yeah it's just produces one

234
00:34:07,280 --> 00:34:17,440
okay if you want to have more than 170 events you only can double or times four times three times

235
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:25,440
four times five you cannot do one point five times you can send an event or you cannot send you

236
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:38,320
cannot send half of an event so let's put this to three and it will produce three times of 127

237
00:34:38,880 --> 00:34:47,680
so and uh different software is different but you can control

238
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:51,920
any software with it that responds on key presses

239
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:57,120
um oops i'm sorry

240
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:00,960
a crash

241
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:15,760
i wanted to press the edit button i don't know why it quite crashed need to check this out

242
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:25,520
um so set the multiplier to one and you will have a one to one respond on your

243
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:35,680
on your lever or for your controller set it lower than zero point five will only produce

244
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:45,120
about 66 key events and put it higher in whole numbers not 1.5 1.7 just one two three

245
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:52,640
will produce uh two times three times four times of the maximum

246
00:35:55,040 --> 00:36:02,880
so i hope now that's it the new controller actions

247
00:36:03,840 --> 00:36:08,960
controller actions we talked about sending media

248
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:19,920
yeah if you use an old version of media key to key and you use your old settings any

249
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:28,000
they did not have the keyboard delay value so if you just use it open it up and and use your

250
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:36,320
um media pad the program will crash because it doesn't have the keyboard delay in your old

251
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:46,720
any so if you do so create a new any start at zero i show you this right now how this can be done

252
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:57,600
um start at zero then everything will be fine um or take your existing any in that case

253
00:36:57,600 --> 00:37:08,480
is as much open any every action with edit it will get a default of 100 decided if this is okay or

254
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:17,600
not and hit save if you do do it with all your actions it they will have then a keyboard delay

255
00:37:17,600 --> 00:37:24,720
and the program will not crash as i said uh start fresh

256
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:37,760
will be like this go into your documents folder and let me get an explorer

257
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:47,600
uh and rename or delete your existing settings any

258
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:57,600
in the media key to key folder it's here because if it turns see

259
00:37:57,600 --> 00:38:10,960
if it doesn't see any settings see it will create a new one and also i take this my setting that is

260
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:17,040
well it was all the time saying i can't find my settings sure it doesn't exist without any

261
00:38:17,120 --> 00:38:30,400
part so start up media key to key and best practice is to start it up and close it then a new settings

262
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:44,400
any is generated and from then you can start making actions it's also recommended if you

263
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:52,400
have an existing let's open the existing the strain simulator thing has some actions

264
00:38:54,960 --> 00:39:07,520
and you decide to to do a new game or whatever um and you edit stuff like this and changing things

265
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:16,480
and hit save and then say and save all of this as a new setting you can do that but remember now

266
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:23,040
the the settings name that's here written in the top line train simulator is already changed on all

267
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:32,240
the actions because you hit save anytime you edit an action and hit save this setting is written

268
00:39:32,240 --> 00:39:43,040
into the actual settings file so when you want to build up a new setting based on let's say this one

269
00:39:44,080 --> 00:39:51,280
at first hit save as and then start editing the actions that's the better practice and you won't

270
00:39:51,280 --> 00:40:00,080
lose the settings of your actions in the old file so that's it for now all the

271
00:40:04,640 --> 00:40:11,200
important URLs will be shown down there for download and for the other video for the basic

272
00:40:12,240 --> 00:40:19,680
video which i recommend to watch first and the home page for download and for your

273
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:30,400
respondings okay um this is the script i can't provide it well it's very simple um

274
00:40:36,080 --> 00:40:47,200
this just does the uh mix 64 media events for the akai um this down here is just

275
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:55,920
for to have the created sequence in the clipboard and this is a little weird vbs don't have any

276
00:40:55,920 --> 00:41:09,200
clipboard commands so it uses internet explorer who now runs the script and then put the result in

277
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:19,760
the clipboard and therefore this is all the code down here um the script here just creates the events

278
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:29,680
you can say set pause to one or zero that means will i have a pause in between the events zero one

279
00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:35,120
how long the pause is in milliseconds and then decide what extension do you want to have

280
00:41:36,080 --> 00:41:44,880
and uh i think this is red and out um no it's nothing so these three

281
00:41:46,720 --> 00:41:49,760
extension is the last value

282
00:41:55,360 --> 00:42:00,480
so if i run the script now it sets a pause of 75 milliseconds in between all the

283
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:12,960
the events and uh that sets all the lights of the apc to three let's create quickly a new event

284
00:42:15,920 --> 00:42:22,320
oh no device is selected because i started with a completely new um

285
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:29,840
um yeah then take this little square button which does not have a light

286
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:39,920
start press it once take the note off and the note on event um do nothing

287
00:42:40,560 --> 00:42:50,880
just take this send midi and where's the script now let's run the script set to one

288
00:42:52,560 --> 00:42:54,800
pause one oh there it is

289
00:42:59,520 --> 00:43:04,640
here's the result and at the same moment this is put into your clipboard so

290
00:43:05,360 --> 00:43:11,360
paste it in and delete the last pause

291
00:43:14,080 --> 00:43:19,440
okay then put it to be to turn all the lights off with a

292
00:43:22,080 --> 00:43:32,560
lower pause value it goes quickly more quickly 15 and zero save

293
00:43:35,440 --> 00:43:36,960
start

294
00:43:39,520 --> 00:43:43,280
i do not know why this takes so long and sometimes oh there it is

295
00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:55,760
it's only because of the the clipboard you could know you cannot copy this therefore

296
00:43:55,760 --> 00:44:01,360
you need the clipboard anyway now we paste in this delete the last pause

297
00:44:01,920 --> 00:44:10,640
p15 and that's it now we have these two sets and what will happen let's have a look right here

298
00:44:17,600 --> 00:44:24,480
it turns on all the red lights with the pause of 75 milliseconds in between when we hit

299
00:44:24,560 --> 00:44:28,880
the second time it removes them but quicker because of the lower pause

300
00:44:31,200 --> 00:44:39,120
so you can create your pictures this little script if you want to download it i don't know

301
00:44:39,120 --> 00:44:45,520
it's just a little thing to me right in the comments of the website

302
00:44:46,480 --> 00:44:50,240
or down here but i like more the website

303
00:44:50,240 --> 00:45:02,080
okay that's it thanks for watching see you next time bye
