00:00.000 --> 00:08.840
hi friends as you can see I'm controlling train simulator with a midi pad from

00:08.840 --> 00:17.280
Akai, here's the gas station is coming

00:31.600 --> 00:34.800
press the horn

00:39.600 --> 00:43.000
hit the brake

00:50.680 --> 00:54.000
I'm already slow

00:55.360 --> 01:05.920
I'm not the best train driver by the way as you can see okay let's come to a stop

01:09.160 --> 01:21.240
and open the doors with this one wait for the stop

01:21.240 --> 01:25.520
doors are opening

01:25.520 --> 01:34.720
turn off the wiper no wrong button sorry this is the interface down here

01:34.720 --> 01:41.120
the HUD

01:41.120 --> 01:47.840
where is it don't remember

01:47.840 --> 01:53.440
well the direction lever

01:56.240 --> 02:03.760
the brake is not applied in this kind of train and the fuse

02:04.720 --> 02:23.000
this I forgot also okay how can this be done just watch this video

02:34.720 --> 02:53.760
first of all many thanks for your feedback and your suggestions of the for

02:53.760 --> 02:58.480
the initial version of midi key to key now this here is the magical thing and

02:58.480 --> 03:04.520
if you never heard about midi key to key make sure you watch the first video

03:04.520 --> 03:12.280
that tells you the basic use of that program for now I'm show you the version

03:12.280 --> 03:21.160
1.9 with many new features and bug fixes and let's talk about quickly about the

03:21.160 --> 03:33.200
bug fixes I have a title and activated by OBS the bug fixes so there is all these

03:33.200 --> 03:42.040
small things the channel is in this here one two sixteen they did not save but

03:42.040 --> 03:48.720
nobody complained it I found it and now they are saved in the settings and the

03:48.720 --> 03:57.960
second thing is if you have an action and react on the second value it's used

03:57.960 --> 04:05.400
rarely normally you only react on the first value the first data value this

04:05.400 --> 04:09.840
was not storage it didn't work but nobody complained because you won't use it

04:09.840 --> 04:26.920
very often so now what's new the great new features yeah where to start with okay

04:26.920 --> 04:34.280
um you have had one settings file your settings in you that stored all your

04:34.600 --> 04:41.080
settings and the settings of the actions the key actions the midi actions now you

04:41.080 --> 04:46.440
have multiple actions if you start midi key to key the first time it's just stores

04:46.440 --> 04:54.400
automatically it settings the settings any in your documents folder and that's

04:54.560 --> 05:08.120
it now you can have several in ease or settings file and where are they in the

05:08.120 --> 05:14.520
file menu you can now load a custom a different settings file here we are

05:14.520 --> 05:19.720
documents your username documents midi key to key you can load a different

05:19.720 --> 05:26.960
setting and save as a different setting you don't need to type any in the end it

05:26.960 --> 05:34.440
does it automatically they all need to be here to be found automatically and then

05:34.440 --> 05:43.280
second new feature is you can start up midi key to key with a special settings

05:43.280 --> 05:58.880
file if you have a shortcut like this just add at the end a name of a path my

05:58.920 --> 06:15.840
setting any if it has white spaces you need to surround to surround it okay so now

06:15.840 --> 06:19.600
it will load my setting this file is not existing this is an example but you can

06:20.400 --> 06:23.520
you can easily create a shortcut like this

06:26.960 --> 06:31.920
and it starts at your desktop and name will be

06:36.640 --> 06:45.760
for example new setting so and as you can see it made a shortcut and called it new setting and

06:46.720 --> 06:55.840
yeah it sets the actual any file and this is the default right now as you can see in the

06:55.840 --> 07:06.880
headline the top line of the program settings any therefore it just says settings okay so

07:07.200 --> 07:17.040
multiple settings files the next thing is since I'm using this archive path apc mini

07:18.240 --> 07:25.520
this one has the feature to let the buttons light up which the cork nanopad didn't have

07:26.320 --> 07:34.400
and well it needs to receive midi commands to light up the buttons in that case it

07:34.400 --> 07:42.160
wants to have note on events and you can have three colors green red and yellow and

07:43.120 --> 07:53.760
same blinking and you can send turn it off so midi key to key needed to send out midi here we are

07:55.760 --> 08:03.040
now you can choose the output device for sending out midi commands this is the old input and now

08:03.040 --> 08:13.040
you need to have an output device and now when you have an action fired you can in addition of a

08:13.040 --> 08:22.400
key command or start program action now define a midi command that is sent out and you can send

08:22.400 --> 08:29.520
whatever you want I'll show you that later you even can send two different midi commands they

08:29.520 --> 08:39.120
toggle each time you fire the action next thing is the mirror midi this is just a small feature

08:39.120 --> 08:47.120
it mirrors the midi into the midi out in the case of the apc it does nothing because I need to push

08:47.120 --> 08:57.840
the start button you see it mirrored my in command of that key and that lets the archive apc mini

08:58.080 --> 09:06.160
turn on the green default light when I press it again nothing happens it stays now on at that

09:06.160 --> 09:18.960
state that's the mirror out that's new um yeah besides the edit the action the action that you

09:18.960 --> 09:24.960
choose here besides this now you have a test button you can test

09:27.440 --> 09:33.360
your action let's start the text editor to see what's happening

09:37.520 --> 09:41.280
let's test the the view button from the train simulator

09:42.160 --> 09:52.000
I have to now the problem is if I push the test button with the mouse the editor loses now

09:54.720 --> 10:01.200
the focus and you don't see the letter I'm typing then let's go to yeah

10:01.360 --> 10:08.480
this action that

10:11.520 --> 10:12.320
as you can see

10:15.280 --> 10:25.120
that pushed an action to obs now that's for testing that's new and also new is now these

10:25.200 --> 10:33.040
these the name or as it was shown the actions was the the midi bytes

10:34.480 --> 10:44.880
and now apc 8 4 is my reminder this is 8 4 is this knob and now you can name your action it's down here

10:46.880 --> 10:54.800
whatever you want hit save and the name will appear now in this list you can now better

10:54.880 --> 10:57.600
find actions if you have a lot like this

11:00.560 --> 11:03.360
now next new thing is

11:08.800 --> 11:15.360
if you have a start program action watch the first video to check this out

11:16.000 --> 11:22.320
now you can choose the state of the action of the program started normal is just a normal

11:22.320 --> 11:31.120
window max is the max window maximized and minimized and or even hidden these four states

11:31.120 --> 11:39.200
you can store and the program that you want to start by an action will have this window state

11:40.320 --> 11:51.280
some users want to fire up a command a box like cnd or let's define a new

11:51.280 --> 11:56.880
action uh let's take the top here

12:00.640 --> 12:09.440
I call this round right one I'll find it at the test that's the first thing and

12:09.600 --> 12:13.600
um we're gonna have a program action

12:16.400 --> 12:24.000
command window the working directory needed and this is the command

12:28.800 --> 12:35.360
do you now first in normal state save okay now hit this one

12:35.600 --> 12:44.400
this is opening the window in the normal state I'll edit this action

12:47.360 --> 12:48.240
maximized

12:53.360 --> 13:00.560
is maximized as you can see well and you can believe me the other actions

13:00.560 --> 13:08.000
uh minimized or even hidden are also working but you won't see anything

13:10.320 --> 13:21.040
let's turn that off so and if you now have a send media action defined um the program

13:21.040 --> 13:29.120
works now as a universal media converter it it listens to a special input media event and then

13:29.120 --> 13:36.960
sends out any media out command or even sequences as long as you wish of media commands

13:38.000 --> 13:45.600
this is done with this new tab send midi and there are many controls but it's easy to handle

13:47.280 --> 13:53.280
first of all activated now this is still our test button

13:53.280 --> 14:06.640
uh to light this up I know it's 90 52 this is the note on and the number of this

14:08.320 --> 14:15.360
and now zero one makes it green the round buttons I believe they are only can be green

14:15.360 --> 14:24.080
and these only can be red so the other will have zero one up to zero six for the decolors and blink

14:24.080 --> 14:35.120
and not blink so now the media command I put in is 90 52 zero one that's it it all will be sent

14:35.120 --> 14:43.040
all the time so this would be would have an effect just on the first time because it stays now on

14:45.920 --> 14:48.960
you won't see difference for this

14:53.520 --> 15:00.320
I have a toggle section B is a command that will be executed the next time

15:02.080 --> 15:07.360
so 90 52 zero to turn it off

15:10.080 --> 15:12.400
off on off on

15:16.000 --> 15:22.800
so these buttons here are defined to change the

15:25.280 --> 15:32.800
the fuse of train simulator and these to change the scenes of OBS you see this one becomes red

15:33.920 --> 15:42.000
and the active one is green blinking now this needs when pressing this an action of seven

15:42.480 --> 15:49.200
commands that makes them all steady green and this one blinking

15:52.160 --> 15:53.920
I have this in the

15:57.280 --> 15:57.920
eight one

16:00.800 --> 16:01.520
eight one

16:05.840 --> 16:07.200
so this is the command

16:08.160 --> 16:17.680
you see they are all to five in the end except the first one is the three

16:19.280 --> 16:24.960
second time is not defined it's only the first time and then if we check all the others

16:26.720 --> 16:27.600
where's the A2

16:29.840 --> 16:30.320
anyway

16:30.800 --> 16:34.880
they are all five to

16:37.040 --> 16:39.040
oh no this is this one here

16:41.760 --> 16:43.120
it's the few two

16:48.000 --> 16:52.720
they're all set to one except now the second one is set to two to make it blink like this

16:53.120 --> 17:03.200
so if we edit then our test button here up in the corner again

17:06.800 --> 17:12.560
this is what you can do just by typing any commands and if you do a second command just one

17:12.560 --> 17:19.280
space and please nothing else so this is executed very quickly

17:19.760 --> 17:22.880
but if you want to wait

17:25.440 --> 17:30.880
a little you can add a pause in milliseconds so let's say 300

17:33.840 --> 17:42.320
oh no add now it adds this in the end it's just where you can cut this out oh well I messed it up

17:43.280 --> 17:49.440
so like this it always puts commands in the end now it since this color command

17:50.400 --> 17:59.360
means out off then wait 300 milliseconds and then turn on the green light again check it out

18:07.440 --> 18:08.000
doesn't work

18:13.280 --> 18:18.800
why is this not working

18:28.480 --> 18:34.000
oh push the totally wrong number 52

18:43.280 --> 18:46.480
it turns on after 300 milliseconds

18:48.480 --> 18:51.840
you can create sequences of

18:53.920 --> 19:00.080
hundreds of commands with a pause in between so you could turn the whole matrix of lights into

19:00.080 --> 19:07.040
showing letters and scrolling left to right and then create light shows just for fun

19:07.440 --> 19:14.640
so if you won't use the input pad manually by typing in hex commands you see now it's only

19:14.640 --> 19:23.360
numbers but it's still bytes of hex so after the 9 comes 9a, 9b, 9c and so on

19:26.560 --> 19:29.600
you can route the last or

19:29.840 --> 19:38.160
or oh I hit the save thing now or remove everything

19:43.920 --> 19:52.160
oh this was not a really not a command

20:00.480 --> 20:02.720
so just type in

20:07.840 --> 20:14.800
rr is a wallet command to remove last or clear all so if you won't

20:15.920 --> 20:24.720
don't like to type in manually you can use these input boxes now note on is the first thing

20:25.440 --> 20:29.280
and you can if you know the hex value of a key

20:31.440 --> 20:37.520
you can just use this or choose the key down here

20:38.800 --> 20:45.200
note on and then note on needs another value if you push add please enter a value this is the

20:45.200 --> 20:52.960
velocity 25 add so then let's turn this note on or just

20:56.880 --> 20:58.000
let it sound for

21:01.520 --> 21:04.320
half a second and then turn it off

21:04.320 --> 21:12.720
off needs no data but it doesn't matter

21:14.720 --> 21:19.360
so and that's it this will play is c3 for half a second and turn it off

21:21.200 --> 21:21.840
so now

21:25.520 --> 21:31.120
let's stop this and use the wave table synthesizer and I'm not sure if you hear it now in the video

21:31.120 --> 21:32.320
just give it a try

21:35.440 --> 21:36.000
you hear that

21:41.200 --> 21:45.120
yeah so you can even play

21:48.240 --> 21:49.280
songs at this

21:51.440 --> 21:58.640
so this is not on not off the most common things you will use but you can send everything and if

21:58.720 --> 22:04.720
you know something just type it in sys x commands are not included here

22:07.520 --> 22:14.080
another thing is channel mode messages these are preformed all nodes off

22:15.040 --> 22:22.000
would be this command it doesn't need any data so this is disabled local on off

22:22.960 --> 22:30.000
reset all controllers omnimode on off it's just without any data fields it is built in command

22:31.520 --> 22:38.880
polyphonic after touch these these types need to have which node do you press and

22:39.840 --> 22:46.320
how strong is the after touch the monophonic after touch channel after touch only needs

22:46.400 --> 22:52.960
how much is the whole keyboard to press and after touch there are many media controls possible

22:52.960 --> 23:02.000
control changes are very huge in number some require two

23:04.560 --> 23:12.400
two commands in a row some require a 14 bit data or the most of them require seven bit data

23:12.960 --> 23:22.000
um midi key to key just takes anything you type in up to 127

23:24.160 --> 23:33.920
so everything will not make sense you need to be an expert for midi to know what you do but

23:33.920 --> 23:39.360
as you can see if you know about midi you can do a lot with this or just type anything

23:40.160 --> 23:47.520
in manually here add pauses in between with this field or by typing p and whatever

23:48.640 --> 23:55.840
a number of milliseconds this is now media out the main job is to light up

23:56.880 --> 24:04.640
midi controllers by sending a command to it to have a reflection what you are doing like this

24:05.200 --> 24:17.200
changing scenes in obias or whatever this is the great new feature and um yeah many users ask

24:17.200 --> 24:25.280
me about what about controllers like these like faders or turning knobs um and i respond

24:25.280 --> 24:33.520
that well this is a thing they need to fire out many midi um commands in a row

24:34.720 --> 24:40.480
on i don't know how to do it or will it make sense and as you could see in the uh

24:41.280 --> 24:50.080
intro video it is working and this is maybe one of the best new features now you can

24:50.640 --> 24:59.920
send um a response to a controller and fire up key commands it just fires key commands as you can see

25:03.120 --> 25:09.440
this controls the the gas of the train a for plus and default minus and as you can see

25:10.480 --> 25:17.440
yeah it even works on this window we won't save this now how is this been done

25:17.600 --> 25:27.520
done define a new one let's take this you start this is the one two three four five the fifth

25:28.080 --> 25:34.960
controller just move it and double click now on the event it created

25:35.680 --> 25:40.800
i recommend giving it a name

25:44.240 --> 25:53.440
fader five so it sends keystrokes yes and uh you just put the first keystrokes it

25:53.440 --> 26:01.760
it will send when you increase the lever um yeah let's just send a q or shift q

26:02.240 --> 26:14.800
and now hit the controller action box and now the the response is brought to the second this is the

26:15.760 --> 26:22.560
value for decrement a controller value so now again press the blue button and press your

26:23.360 --> 26:33.520
other action as you can see this is now coming here if you want to change this again you can

26:33.520 --> 26:39.120
just type in anything manually but you know when you want to use the blue thing it's always

26:39.840 --> 26:47.600
when this checkbox is on it will manipulate this input box so turn it off

26:47.600 --> 26:59.520
and change it here when you turn this checkbox again off your shift w is not lost so this is just

27:01.360 --> 27:08.160
the easy thing now you have two keys to find this will be fired when the new value of

27:08.720 --> 27:15.040
by moving a controller is higher and if you move the controller the controller

27:15.680 --> 27:22.480
fader down the new value is lower and then the shift w is fired now

27:24.640 --> 27:33.520
this two things are very important the keyboard delay is 100 does a good job on

27:33.600 --> 27:44.880
uh just controlling programs and some users told me obs studio is not responding to

27:44.880 --> 27:54.640
midi key to key and uh only when it has the focus and when you use your keyboard it works even as

27:54.640 --> 28:03.120
if it has not the focus so i found out if you have a very low keyboard delay value you can

28:03.120 --> 28:15.520
even set this to zero that means key pressed down and up uh in the same moment um my obs studio is

28:15.520 --> 28:25.200
responding at about 40 and 50 milliseconds so and if you go lower with the keyboard delay

28:26.160 --> 28:34.480
it will just respond on any actions when it is in focus so that's a performance problem

28:35.360 --> 28:42.400
and our system is not different now when we want to have a controller action like this put it down

28:42.400 --> 28:53.040
all the way first of all check zero and leave the multiplier to one that means the controller

28:53.600 --> 28:54.240
will have

28:58.000 --> 29:08.080
127 values from the bottom to the top and the multiplier to set to one fires up 127

29:08.800 --> 29:17.440
times the key press so one to one with no delay save this and check it out if now set the focus

29:17.440 --> 29:30.640
to the editor and move the fader see i put in a new line fader down creates w

29:33.440 --> 29:39.680
so and then if you set the delay to zero this reacts very quickly

29:39.840 --> 29:43.680
so

29:46.400 --> 29:51.120
but if you want to control a game it's different

29:53.360 --> 30:00.880
how they respond train simulator is special it needs a little longer key press to react to

30:00.880 --> 30:08.320
to move the gas lever and so i put this to 10 that's a thing you can experiment with

30:09.360 --> 30:15.920
it even works on as just a single key press no controller action

30:18.480 --> 30:28.560
you can type in a value then then let's the key down for this time you put in

30:28.560 --> 30:36.480
before it releases to to make a key press longer but there's a problem i don't know why so far

30:36.480 --> 30:43.040
if you put it too high over a second or something the program will not longer respond i don't know

30:43.040 --> 30:49.760
what it is maybe it can be fixed in the future but i think it's not really important to have this

30:49.760 --> 30:59.520
right now so the keyboard delay let's see when you put it to 10 what will be the difference

31:04.480 --> 31:08.960
now 10 doesn't really make a difference let's put it a little longer

31:19.760 --> 31:22.960
set it to 80

31:31.760 --> 31:39.120
see you really won't don't want that by controlling any software but

31:40.640 --> 31:43.040
who knows you might need it

31:43.040 --> 31:52.560
always start with a zero and the keyboard events will be fired up immediately

31:54.000 --> 31:59.040
so the second thing is a multiplier and that's still experimental

32:00.240 --> 32:04.080
because i can't really do anything i want to

32:04.640 --> 32:18.160
as mentioned the the midi standard is 127 values but if you have a lever in a software that has

32:18.160 --> 32:31.840
only five or six different states to control you will set the multiplier lower let's say to

32:31.840 --> 32:39.040
1.2 and this is not a point it's point or comma depending of your country i'm in germany so i

32:39.040 --> 32:51.520
need to type in a comma so i have the multiplier lower than one and now this is the max

32:54.960 --> 32:55.520
you see it

32:55.520 --> 33:08.000
it cuts the maximum numbers set it to 0.1

33:13.680 --> 33:20.480
it cuts the amount always in half and that's the only thing it can do because it has to count

33:20.480 --> 33:33.760
the the input events as you can see they are coming single one by one and it has just to count

33:35.360 --> 33:41.440
10 times to wait now never fire up another keyboard action so you cannot have

33:45.280 --> 33:48.320
you cannot have everywhere you you wish

33:50.800 --> 33:57.360
last test of this zero zero one

34:02.160 --> 34:04.160
yeah it's just produces one

34:07.280 --> 34:17.440
okay if you want to have more than 170 events you only can double or times four times three times

34:17.520 --> 34:25.440
four times five you cannot do one point five times you can send an event or you cannot send you

34:25.440 --> 34:38.320
cannot send half of an event so let's put this to three and it will produce three times of 127

34:38.880 --> 34:47.680
so and uh different software is different but you can control

34:49.040 --> 34:51.920
any software with it that responds on key presses

34:54.560 --> 34:57.120
um oops i'm sorry

35:00.400 --> 35:00.960
a crash

35:09.200 --> 35:15.760
i wanted to press the edit button i don't know why it quite crashed need to check this out

35:17.280 --> 35:25.520
um so set the multiplier to one and you will have a one to one respond on your

35:26.320 --> 35:35.680
on your lever or for your controller set it lower than zero point five will only produce

35:36.320 --> 35:45.120
about 66 key events and put it higher in whole numbers not 1.5 1.7 just one two three

35:46.560 --> 35:52.640
will produce uh two times three times four times of the maximum

35:55.040 --> 36:02.880
so i hope now that's it the new controller actions

36:03.840 --> 36:08.960
controller actions we talked about sending media

36:13.680 --> 36:19.920
yeah if you use an old version of media key to key and you use your old settings any

36:20.800 --> 36:28.000
they did not have the keyboard delay value so if you just use it open it up and and use your

36:28.320 --> 36:36.320
um media pad the program will crash because it doesn't have the keyboard delay in your old

36:36.320 --> 36:46.720
any so if you do so create a new any start at zero i show you this right now how this can be done

36:46.720 --> 36:57.600
um start at zero then everything will be fine um or take your existing any in that case

36:57.600 --> 37:08.480
is as much open any every action with edit it will get a default of 100 decided if this is okay or

37:08.480 --> 37:17.600
not and hit save if you do do it with all your actions it they will have then a keyboard delay

37:17.600 --> 37:24.720
and the program will not crash as i said uh start fresh

37:28.160 --> 37:37.760
will be like this go into your documents folder and let me get an explorer

37:38.480 --> 37:47.600
uh and rename or delete your existing settings any

37:51.040 --> 37:57.600
in the media key to key folder it's here because if it turns see

37:57.600 --> 38:10.960
if it doesn't see any settings see it will create a new one and also i take this my setting that is

38:10.960 --> 38:17.040
well it was all the time saying i can't find my settings sure it doesn't exist without any

38:17.120 --> 38:30.400
part so start up media key to key and best practice is to start it up and close it then a new settings

38:30.400 --> 38:44.400
any is generated and from then you can start making actions it's also recommended if you

38:45.200 --> 38:52.400
have an existing let's open the existing the strain simulator thing has some actions

38:54.960 --> 39:07.520
and you decide to to do a new game or whatever um and you edit stuff like this and changing things

39:07.520 --> 39:16.480
and hit save and then say and save all of this as a new setting you can do that but remember now

39:16.480 --> 39:23.040
the the settings name that's here written in the top line train simulator is already changed on all

39:23.040 --> 39:32.240
the actions because you hit save anytime you edit an action and hit save this setting is written

39:32.240 --> 39:43.040
into the actual settings file so when you want to build up a new setting based on let's say this one

39:44.080 --> 39:51.280
at first hit save as and then start editing the actions that's the better practice and you won't

39:51.280 --> 40:00.080
lose the settings of your actions in the old file so that's it for now all the

40:04.640 --> 40:11.200
important URLs will be shown down there for download and for the other video for the basic

40:12.240 --> 40:19.680
video which i recommend to watch first and the home page for download and for your

40:19.680 --> 40:30.400
respondings okay um this is the script i can't provide it well it's very simple um

40:36.080 --> 40:47.200
this just does the uh mix 64 media events for the akai um this down here is just

40:47.920 --> 40:55.920
for to have the created sequence in the clipboard and this is a little weird vbs don't have any

40:55.920 --> 41:09.200
clipboard commands so it uses internet explorer who now runs the script and then put the result in

41:09.200 --> 41:19.760
the clipboard and therefore this is all the code down here um the script here just creates the events

41:20.720 --> 41:29.680
you can say set pause to one or zero that means will i have a pause in between the events zero one

41:29.680 --> 41:35.120
how long the pause is in milliseconds and then decide what extension do you want to have

41:36.080 --> 41:44.880
and uh i think this is red and out um no it's nothing so these three

41:46.720 --> 41:49.760
extension is the last value

41:55.360 --> 42:00.480
so if i run the script now it sets a pause of 75 milliseconds in between all the

42:01.440 --> 42:12.960
the events and uh that sets all the lights of the apc to three let's create quickly a new event

42:15.920 --> 42:22.320
oh no device is selected because i started with a completely new um

42:23.200 --> 42:29.840
um yeah then take this little square button which does not have a light

42:32.480 --> 42:39.920
start press it once take the note off and the note on event um do nothing

42:40.560 --> 42:50.880
just take this send midi and where's the script now let's run the script set to one

42:52.560 --> 42:54.800
pause one oh there it is

42:59.520 --> 43:04.640
here's the result and at the same moment this is put into your clipboard so

43:05.360 --> 43:11.360
paste it in and delete the last pause

43:14.080 --> 43:19.440
okay then put it to be to turn all the lights off with a

43:22.080 --> 43:32.560
lower pause value it goes quickly more quickly 15 and zero save

43:35.440 --> 43:36.960
start

43:39.520 --> 43:43.280
i do not know why this takes so long and sometimes oh there it is

43:46.800 --> 43:55.760
it's only because of the the clipboard you could know you cannot copy this therefore

43:55.760 --> 44:01.360
you need the clipboard anyway now we paste in this delete the last pause

44:01.920 --> 44:10.640
p15 and that's it now we have these two sets and what will happen let's have a look right here

44:17.600 --> 44:24.480
it turns on all the red lights with the pause of 75 milliseconds in between when we hit

44:24.560 --> 44:28.880
the second time it removes them but quicker because of the lower pause

44:31.200 --> 44:39.120
so you can create your pictures this little script if you want to download it i don't know

44:39.120 --> 44:45.520
it's just a little thing to me right in the comments of the website

44:46.480 --> 44:50.240
or down here but i like more the website

44:50.240 --> 45:02.080
okay that's it thanks for watching see you next time bye
