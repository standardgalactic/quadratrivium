 The new point-of-sale (POS) terminals in supermarkets are advanced computers that can perform a wide range of tasks beyond simply totaling a bill. These terminals have the capability to validate credit card transactions by making automatic phone calls to banks for real-time authorization. They also keep track of sales data, which helps in creating automated reorder lists for stocking the shop.

Furthermore, there are already operational warehouses that use automation. Goods delivered to these warehouses are automatically sorted by computers using camera systems that read identifying labels on the shipments. The computers then determine where each item should be stored and can efficiently retrieve items when needed without human intervention.

These advancements in technology are leading towards highly automated shopping systems that would require minimal human labor. Each keystroke made by a cashier is recorded, allowing for detailed monitoring of their performance, including speed, amount of money processed per hour, and error rates.

In Denmark, cashiers have resisted using these new terminals until the feature that tracks their performance was removed, expressing concerns about privacy and working conditions.

In summary, the evolution of POS terminals into sophisticated computers has significant implications for the future of retail work, with potential for high levels of automation and surveillance of cashiers' performance.
