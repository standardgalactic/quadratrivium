0	13000	The new supermarket checkout terminals have microprocessors inside them.
13000	16000	They're now called point-of-sale terminals.
16000	18000	Each one is a computer in its own right,
18000	28000	and they have the power to do a whole lot of new things the mechanical cash registers couldn't do.
28000	37000	Besides totaling the bill, this terminal can check up on the validity of a credit card.
37000	45000	All the cashier has to do is punch in the card number and the terminal makes its own automatic telephone call.
45000	49000	That's just a step from the terminal actually ringing your bank's computer
49000	56000	and transferring funds to the shop's bank computer.
56000	60000	This is already being done in shops in New York.
60000	64000	As each item is checked out, the terminals remember what has been sold,
64000	70000	so automatically a total list of what has to be ordered to restock the shop is being built up.
70000	77000	In the future, that reorder will be issued quite automatically.
77000	81000	And will be responded to by a completely automatic warehouse.
81000	84000	Automatic warehouses are working now.
84000	88000	This one is not part of a supermarket, but it could be.
88000	93000	Loads are delivered to it by lorry and run in towards the main store.
93000	97000	They have identifying labels on their sides.
97000	113000	A camera reads that label, and a computer automatically decides where the load will be stored.
113000	121000	No one needs to know where anything is stored, and no one cares. The computer does it all.
143000	158000	When the goods are needed, the computer will know where to find them.
158000	170000	We are on the verge of automated shopping systems that will use very few people.
170000	180000	All the man has to do is read which lorry this load is for.
180000	186000	If you think that is sinister, just think for a moment about the way the computer in the terminal works.
186000	191000	Each time a key is pressed, the computer makes a note of the time.
191000	196000	The terminals are keeping a record of how fast each girl is punching her machine.
196000	203000	It can make a detailed record of each cashier, how much money she takes per hour, her number of mistakes.
203000	207000	In Denmark, where shop automation is more developed than here,
207000	212000	the checkout girls in the biggest supermarket chain have refused to operate the new terminals
212000	217000	till that part of the computer's supervising program has been deleted.
