00:00.000 --> 00:13.000
The new supermarket checkout terminals have microprocessors inside them.

00:13.000 --> 00:16.000
They're now called point-of-sale terminals.

00:16.000 --> 00:18.000
Each one is a computer in its own right,

00:18.000 --> 00:28.000
and they have the power to do a whole lot of new things the mechanical cash registers couldn't do.

00:28.000 --> 00:37.000
Besides totaling the bill, this terminal can check up on the validity of a credit card.

00:37.000 --> 00:45.000
All the cashier has to do is punch in the card number and the terminal makes its own automatic telephone call.

00:45.000 --> 00:49.000
That's just a step from the terminal actually ringing your bank's computer

00:49.000 --> 00:56.000
and transferring funds to the shop's bank computer.

00:56.000 --> 01:00.000
This is already being done in shops in New York.

01:00.000 --> 01:04.000
As each item is checked out, the terminals remember what has been sold,

01:04.000 --> 01:10.000
so automatically a total list of what has to be ordered to restock the shop is being built up.

01:10.000 --> 01:17.000
In the future, that reorder will be issued quite automatically.

01:17.000 --> 01:21.000
And will be responded to by a completely automatic warehouse.

01:21.000 --> 01:24.000
Automatic warehouses are working now.

01:24.000 --> 01:28.000
This one is not part of a supermarket, but it could be.

01:28.000 --> 01:33.000
Loads are delivered to it by lorry and run in towards the main store.

01:33.000 --> 01:37.000
They have identifying labels on their sides.

01:37.000 --> 01:53.000
A camera reads that label, and a computer automatically decides where the load will be stored.

01:53.000 --> 02:01.000
No one needs to know where anything is stored, and no one cares. The computer does it all.

02:23.000 --> 02:38.000
When the goods are needed, the computer will know where to find them.

02:38.000 --> 02:50.000
We are on the verge of automated shopping systems that will use very few people.

02:50.000 --> 03:00.000
All the man has to do is read which lorry this load is for.

03:00.000 --> 03:06.000
If you think that is sinister, just think for a moment about the way the computer in the terminal works.

03:06.000 --> 03:11.000
Each time a key is pressed, the computer makes a note of the time.

03:11.000 --> 03:16.000
The terminals are keeping a record of how fast each girl is punching her machine.

03:16.000 --> 03:23.000
It can make a detailed record of each cashier, how much money she takes per hour, her number of mistakes.

03:23.000 --> 03:27.000
In Denmark, where shop automation is more developed than here,

03:27.000 --> 03:32.000
the checkout girls in the biggest supermarket chain have refused to operate the new terminals

03:32.000 --> 03:37.000
till that part of the computer's supervising program has been deleted.
