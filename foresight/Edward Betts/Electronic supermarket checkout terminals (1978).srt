1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:13,000
The new supermarket checkout terminals have microprocessors inside them.

2
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
They're now called point-of-sale terminals.

3
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Each one is a computer in its own right,

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:28,000
and they have the power to do a whole lot of new things the mechanical cash registers couldn't do.

5
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Besides totaling the bill, this terminal can check up on the validity of a credit card.

6
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:45,000
All the cashier has to do is punch in the card number and the terminal makes its own automatic telephone call.

7
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,000
That's just a step from the terminal actually ringing your bank's computer

8
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:56,000
and transferring funds to the shop's bank computer.

9
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,000
This is already being done in shops in New York.

10
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
As each item is checked out, the terminals remember what has been sold,

11
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:10,000
so automatically a total list of what has to be ordered to restock the shop is being built up.

12
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:17,000
In the future, that reorder will be issued quite automatically.

13
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,000
And will be responded to by a completely automatic warehouse.

14
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Automatic warehouses are working now.

15
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,000
This one is not part of a supermarket, but it could be.

16
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Loads are delivered to it by lorry and run in towards the main store.

17
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:37,000
They have identifying labels on their sides.

18
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:53,000
A camera reads that label, and a computer automatically decides where the load will be stored.

19
00:01:53,000 --> 00:02:01,000
No one needs to know where anything is stored, and no one cares. The computer does it all.

20
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:38,000
When the goods are needed, the computer will know where to find them.

21
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:50,000
We are on the verge of automated shopping systems that will use very few people.

22
00:02:50,000 --> 00:03:00,000
All the man has to do is read which lorry this load is for.

23
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:06,000
If you think that is sinister, just think for a moment about the way the computer in the terminal works.

24
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Each time a key is pressed, the computer makes a note of the time.

25
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:16,000
The terminals are keeping a record of how fast each girl is punching her machine.

26
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:23,000
It can make a detailed record of each cashier, how much money she takes per hour, her number of mistakes.

27
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:27,000
In Denmark, where shop automation is more developed than here,

28
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:32,000
the checkout girls in the biggest supermarket chain have refused to operate the new terminals

29
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:37,000
till that part of the computer's supervising program has been deleted.
