1. **Inverse Functions Reverse Roles**: The inverse function reverses the input and output of the original function, meaning if \( f(x) = y \), then \( f^{-1}(y) = x \).

2. **Graph Transformation**: The graph of the inverse function is a reflection of the original function's graph over the line \( y = x \).

3. **Composition with Identity**: When you compose a function with its inverse, you get the identity function. In other words, \( f(f^{-1}(x)) = x \) and \( f^{-1}(f(x)) = x \).

4. **Horizontal Line Test**: A function has an inverse if every horizontal line intersects the graph of the function at most once. This is known as the horizontal line test.

5. **Domain and Range Swap**: The domain of the original function becomes the range of its inverse, and vice versa. If the domain of \( f \) is \( D_f \), then the domain of \( f^{-1} \) is \( R_f \) (the range of \( f \)), and the range of \( f \) is \( D_{f^{-1}} \) (the domain of \( f^{-1} \)).

6. **Square Root Example**: For the specific function \( p(x) = \sqrt{x - 2} \), its inverse \( p^{-1}(x) \) can be expressed algebraically as \( x = (\sqrt{y - 2})^2 + 2 \), but we restrict \( y \geq 0 \) because the square root function is only defined for non-negative numbers.

7. **Restrictions**: For the square root function and its inverse, we have specific restrictions: the domain of \( p \) is \( x \geq 2 \) (or \( x \) in the interval from 2 to infinity), and the range is \( y \geq 0 \) (or \( y \) in the interval from 0 to infinity). For its inverse, the domain is \( y \geq 0 \) (or \( y \) in the interval from 0 to infinity), and the range is \( x \geq 2 \) (or \( x \) in the interval from 0 to infinity).

Understanding these properties of inverse functions is crucial for working with functions that have both a clear definition and a clear restriction, such as logarithmic and exponential functions.

 The video explains the concept of Bayesian inference using category theory and the notion of commutativity in diagrams. Here's a summary of the key points and concepts:

1. **Bayesian Inference**: This is a method of statistical inference where you update the probability estimate for a hypothesis as more evidence or information becomes available. It's based on Bayes' theorem from probability theory.

2. **Bayes' Theorem**: The theorem relates conditional and marginal probabilities. It states that:
   \[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
   where \(P(H|E)\) is the probability of hypothesis H given evidence E, \(P(E|H)\) is the probability of evidence E given that H is true, \(P(H)\) is the prior probability of hypothesis H, and \(P(E)\) is the total probability of observing evidence E.

3. **Commutativity in Category Theory**: In a category, an operation is commutative if it satisfies the condition of yielding the same result regardless of the order in which the operations are applied. This concept is used to reformulate Bayes' theorem in a way that highlights the symmetry between 'if I see this event occurring, what's the probability of another event?' and 'if another event is occurring, what's the probability of me seeing this event?'

4. **Diagrammatic Reformulation**: The video uses a diagrammatic approach to represent the relationship between different probabilities in a visual and structured way. By considering the commutativity of this diagram, we can derive that:
   \[ P(X|Y) = \frac{P(Y|X) \cdot P(X)}{P(Y)} \]
   is equivalent to the original formulation of Bayes' theorem.

5. **Bayesian Inverse**: The map \(g\) constructed from this reformulation is called a Bayesian inverse. It allows us to reason backward from observed events (like seeing someone at the store) to infer probabilities about hidden events (like the likelihood of a good sale).

6. **Example**: The video provides an example where X represents a 'good sale' or 'not good sale,' and Y represents 'going to the store' or 'not going.' The probabilities for these events are given, and using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the probability of observing a 'good sale' sign given that someone went to the store.

7. **Generalization**: The category-theoretic approach allows us to generalize this idea beyond just binary events or even single events, to any probabilistic relationship between events.

In essence, the video demonstrates how category theory provides a powerful language and set of concepts that can be used to reformulate and understand probability theory and Bayesian inference, offering new insights and potential for generalization across different fields and problems.
