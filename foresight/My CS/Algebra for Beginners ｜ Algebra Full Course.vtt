00:00.000 --> 00:07.200
This video is about the exponent rules, rules that govern expressions like two to the fifth

00:07.200 --> 00:09.940
or x to the n.

00:09.940 --> 00:16.720
Two to the fifth is just shorthand for two times two times two times two times two, written

00:16.720 --> 00:25.660
five times, and similarly x to the n is just x multiplied by itself, n times.

00:25.660 --> 00:31.300
When we write these expressions, the number on the bottom that's being multiplied by itself

00:31.300 --> 00:37.900
is called the base, and the number at the top telling us how many times we're multiplying

00:37.900 --> 00:42.180
the base by itself is called the exponent.

00:42.180 --> 00:47.220
Sometimes the exponent is also called the power.

00:47.220 --> 00:54.780
The product rule says that a five x to the power of n times x to the power of m, that's

00:54.780 --> 00:59.540
the same thing as x to the n plus m power.

00:59.540 --> 01:11.300
In other words, when I multiply two expressions with the same base, then I can add their exponents.

01:11.300 --> 01:17.260
For example, if I have two cubed times two to the fourth, that's equal to two to the

01:17.260 --> 01:24.020
seventh, and that makes sense because two cubed times two to the fourth means I multiply

01:24.260 --> 01:31.220
two by itself three times, and then I multiply that by two multiplied by itself four times,

01:31.220 --> 01:40.860
and in the end, I have two multiplied by itself seven times, which is two to the seventh.

01:40.860 --> 01:45.420
I'm just adding up the number of times that's multiplied in each piece to get the number

01:45.420 --> 01:48.460
of times that's multiplied total.

01:48.460 --> 01:54.860
The quotient rule says that a five x to the n power divided by x to the m power, that's

01:54.860 --> 01:58.500
equal to x to the n minus m power.

01:58.500 --> 02:05.740
In other words, if I divide two expressions with the same base, then I can subtract their

02:05.740 --> 02:08.940
exponents.

02:08.940 --> 02:14.700
For example, three to the sixth divided by three squared is going to be three to the

02:14.700 --> 02:18.180
six minus two, or three to the fourth.

02:18.180 --> 02:23.980
And this makes sense because three to the sixth means I multiply three by itself six

02:23.980 --> 02:29.580
times, and then I divide that by three multiplied by itself twice.

02:29.580 --> 02:34.300
So when I cancel out threes, I have four threes left.

02:34.300 --> 02:38.620
Notice that I have to subtract the number of threes on the bottom from the number of

02:38.620 --> 02:42.860
threes at the top to get my number of threes remaining.

02:42.860 --> 02:46.180
That's why I subtract my exponents.

02:46.180 --> 02:52.300
The power rule tells us if I have x to the n power raised to the m power, that's the

02:52.300 --> 02:56.860
same thing as x to the n times m power.

02:56.860 --> 03:05.700
In other words, when I raise a power to a power, I get to multiply the exponents.

03:05.700 --> 03:13.380
For example, five to the fourth cubed is equal to five to the four times three, or five to

03:13.380 --> 03:14.700
the twelfth.

03:14.700 --> 03:20.180
And this makes sense because five to the fourth cubed can be thought of as five to the fourth

03:20.180 --> 03:25.740
times five to the fourth times five to the fourth, expanding this out some more.

03:25.740 --> 03:33.900
That's five times five times five times five times the same thing times the same thing

03:33.900 --> 03:36.180
again.

03:36.180 --> 03:47.820
So I have three groups of four fives, which is a total of three times four or twelve fives.

03:47.820 --> 03:53.100
The next rule involves what happens when I raise a number or a variable to the zeroth

03:53.100 --> 03:54.380
power.

03:54.380 --> 03:59.660
It turns out that anything to the zeroth power is equal to one.

03:59.660 --> 04:05.140
Usually this is just taken as a definition, but here's why it makes sense to me.

04:05.140 --> 04:11.420
If you have something like two cubed divided by two cubed, well, certainly that has to

04:11.420 --> 04:12.660
equal one.

04:12.660 --> 04:15.340
Anything divided by itself is just one.

04:15.340 --> 04:22.660
But using the quotient rule, we know that this is the same thing as two to the three

04:22.660 --> 04:24.380
minus three.

04:24.380 --> 04:30.420
Because when we divide two things with the same base, we get to subtract their exponents.

04:30.420 --> 04:34.420
Therefore, this is the same thing as two to the zero.

04:34.420 --> 04:41.020
So two to the zero has to equal one in order to make it work with the quotient rule.

04:41.020 --> 04:47.180
And the same argument shows that anything to the zero power has to be equal to one.

04:47.180 --> 04:52.020
What happens when we take something to a negative power?

04:52.020 --> 04:57.100
X to the n is equal to one over x to the n.

04:57.100 --> 05:02.060
Again, most people just take this as a definition of a negative exponent, but here's why it

05:02.060 --> 05:04.540
makes sense.

05:04.540 --> 05:10.180
If I take something like five to the seventh times five to the negative seventh, then by

05:10.180 --> 05:16.540
the product rule, this has to equal five to the seven plus negative seven, which is five

05:16.540 --> 05:17.700
to the zero.

05:17.700 --> 05:21.580
And we just said that that is equal to one.

05:21.580 --> 05:25.460
Now I have the equation five to the seventh times five to the negative seventh equals

05:25.460 --> 05:26.460
one.

05:26.460 --> 05:31.780
If I divide both sides by five to the seventh, I get that five to the negative seventh has

05:31.780 --> 05:34.660
to equal one over five to the seventh.

05:34.660 --> 05:37.700
So that's where this rule about negative exponents comes from.

05:37.700 --> 05:42.100
It has to be true in order to be consistent with the product rule.

05:42.100 --> 05:45.700
Finally, let's look at a fractional exponent.

05:45.700 --> 05:49.940
What does an expression like x to the one over n really mean?

05:49.940 --> 05:54.900
Well, it means the nth root of x.

05:54.900 --> 06:02.380
For example, 64 to the one third power means the cube root of 64, which happens to be four.

06:02.380 --> 06:07.860
And nine to the one half means the square root of nine, which is usually written without

06:07.860 --> 06:11.100
that little superscript up there.

06:11.100 --> 06:15.020
Now the square root of nine is just three.

06:15.020 --> 06:17.100
Fractional exponents also make sense.

06:17.100 --> 06:27.140
For example, if I have five to the one third and I cube that, then by the power rule, that's

06:27.140 --> 06:34.820
equal to five to the one third times three, which is just five to the one or five.

06:34.820 --> 06:40.780
So in other words, five to the one third is the number that when you cube it, you get

06:40.780 --> 06:42.100
five.

06:42.100 --> 06:45.620
And that's exactly what's meant by the cube root of five.

06:45.620 --> 06:51.740
The cube root of five is also a number that when you cube it, you get five.

06:51.740 --> 06:56.900
The next rule tells us we can distribute an exponent over a product.

06:56.900 --> 07:03.180
In other words, if we have a product x times y all raised to the nth power, that's equal

07:03.180 --> 07:07.100
to x to the n times y to the n.

07:07.100 --> 07:14.980
For example, five times seven, all raised to the third power is equal to five cubed

07:14.980 --> 07:16.940
times seven cubed.

07:16.940 --> 07:23.500
And this makes sense because five times seven, all raised to the cube power can be expanded

07:23.500 --> 07:29.340
as five times seven times five times seven times five times seven.

07:29.340 --> 07:34.260
But if I rearrange the order of multiplication, this is the same thing as five times five

07:34.260 --> 07:40.780
times five times seven times seven times seven or five cubed times seven cubed.

07:40.780 --> 07:45.060
Similarly, we could distribute an exponent over quotient.

07:45.060 --> 07:50.700
If we have the quotient x over y, all raised to the n power, that's the same as x to the

07:50.700 --> 07:53.620
n over y to the n.

07:53.620 --> 08:00.060
For example, two sevenths raised to the fifth power is the same thing as two to the fifth

08:00.060 --> 08:01.940
over seven to the fifth.

08:01.940 --> 08:09.180
This makes sense because two sevenths to the fifth can be expanded as two sevenths multiplied

08:09.180 --> 08:16.340
by itself five times, which can be written rewritten as two multiplied by itself five

08:16.340 --> 08:21.100
times divided by seven multiplied by itself five times.

08:21.100 --> 08:27.540
And that's two to the fifth over seven to the fifth as wanted.

08:27.540 --> 08:37.220
We've seen that we can distribute an exponent over multiplication and division, but be careful

08:37.220 --> 08:44.900
because we cannot distribute an exponent over addition or subtraction.

08:44.900 --> 08:53.660
For example, a plus b to the n is not generally equal to a to the n plus b to the n.

08:53.660 --> 08:59.460
A minus b to the n is not generally equal to a to the n minus b to the n.

08:59.460 --> 09:04.580
And if you're not sure, just try an example with numbers.

09:04.580 --> 09:13.140
For example, two plus three squared is not the same thing as two squared plus three squared.

09:13.140 --> 09:20.660
And two minus three squared is definitely not equal to two squared minus three squared.

09:20.660 --> 09:25.620
In this video, I gave eight exponent rules, which I'll list again here.

09:25.620 --> 09:34.820
There's the product rule, the quotient rule, the power rule, the zero exponent, the negative

09:34.820 --> 09:44.260
exponent, the fractional exponent, and there are the two rules involving distributing exponents

09:44.260 --> 09:50.580
across multiplication and division.

09:50.580 --> 09:55.780
In another video, I'll use these exponent rules to rewrite and simplify expressions

09:55.780 --> 09:58.900
involving exponents.

09:58.900 --> 10:03.380
In this video, I'll work out some examples of simplifying expressions using exponent

10:03.380 --> 10:04.380
rules.

10:04.380 --> 10:08.860
I'll start by reviewing the exponent rules.

10:08.860 --> 10:14.860
The product rule says that when you multiply two expressions with the same base, you add

10:14.860 --> 10:16.660
the exponents.

10:16.660 --> 10:22.220
The quotient rule says that when you divide two expressions with the same base, you subtract

10:22.220 --> 10:23.740
the exponents.

10:23.740 --> 10:31.340
The power rule says that when you take a power to a power, you multiply the exponents.

10:31.340 --> 10:37.540
The power of zero rule says that anything to the zero power is one as long as the base

10:37.540 --> 10:40.020
is not zero.

10:40.020 --> 10:45.300
Since zero to the zero is undefined, it doesn't make sense.

10:45.300 --> 10:51.780
With exponents, to evaluate x to the minus n, we take the reciprocal one over x to the

10:51.780 --> 10:53.420
n.

10:53.420 --> 10:59.460
To evaluate a fractional exponent, like x to the one over n, we take the nth root of

10:59.460 --> 11:01.720
x.

11:01.720 --> 11:09.140
We can distribute an exponent over a product, a times b to the n is equal to a to the n times

11:09.140 --> 11:14.420
b to the n, and we can distribute an exponent over a quotient.

11:14.420 --> 11:20.140
A over b to the n is a to the n over b to the n.

11:20.140 --> 11:26.580
In the rest of this video, we'll use these exponent rules to simplify expressions.

11:26.580 --> 11:32.220
For our first example, we want to simplify 3 times x to the minus 2 divided by x to the

11:32.220 --> 11:33.220
fourth.

11:33.220 --> 11:36.460
There are several possible ways to proceed.

11:36.460 --> 11:43.180
For example, we could use the negative exponent rule to write x to the minus 2 as one over

11:43.180 --> 11:44.900
x squared.

11:44.900 --> 11:49.260
All that gets divided by x to the fourth still.

11:49.260 --> 11:52.500
Notice that we only take the reciprocal of the x squared.

11:52.500 --> 11:57.260
The 3 stays where it is, and that's because the exponent of negative 2 only applies to

11:57.260 --> 12:00.820
the x, not to the 3.

12:00.820 --> 12:09.260
Now if we think of 3 as 3 over 1, we have a product of two fractions in our numerator,

12:09.260 --> 12:15.220
and so we evaluate that by taking the product of the numerators times the product of the

12:15.220 --> 12:22.140
denominators, which is 3 over x squared all divided by x to the fourth.

12:22.140 --> 12:29.180
I can think of x to the fourth as x to the fourth over 1, so now I have a fraction over

12:29.180 --> 12:35.500
a fraction, which I can evaluate by multiplying by the reciprocal.

12:35.500 --> 12:42.620
That simplifies to 3 times 1 divided by x squared times x to the fourth, which is 3

12:42.620 --> 12:49.900
over x to the sixth using the product rule, since x squared times x to the fourth is equal

12:49.900 --> 12:55.460
to x to the 2 plus 4, or x to the sixth.

12:55.460 --> 13:04.140
An alternate way of solving this problem is to start by using the quotient rule.

13:04.140 --> 13:10.020
I can rewrite this as 3 times x to the minus 2 over x to the fourth, and by the quotient

13:10.020 --> 13:18.820
rule that's 3 times x to the minus 2 minus 4, or 3 times x to the minus 6.

13:18.820 --> 13:25.300
Now using the negative exponent rule, x to the minus 6 is 1 over x to the sixth, and

13:25.300 --> 13:30.940
this product of fractions simplifies to 3 over x to the sixth.

13:30.940 --> 13:34.140
The same answer I got before.

13:34.140 --> 13:37.820
The second problem can be solved in similar ways.

13:37.820 --> 13:42.420
Please pause the video and try it before going on.

13:42.420 --> 13:49.020
One way to simplify would be to use the negative exponent rule first and rewrite y to the minus

13:49.020 --> 13:53.420
5 as 1 over y to the fifth.

13:53.420 --> 14:03.980
Using of this as a fraction divided by a fraction, I can multiply by the reciprocal

14:03.980 --> 14:11.260
and get 4y cubed y to the fifth over 1 by the product rule.

14:11.260 --> 14:19.380
The numerator here is 4y to the eighth, and so my final answer is just 4y to the eighth.

14:20.020 --> 14:25.620
Alternatively, I could decide to use the quotient rule first.

14:25.620 --> 14:33.060
As in the previous problem, I can write this as 4y cubed minus negative 5 by the quotient

14:33.060 --> 14:38.020
rule, and so that's 4y to the eighth as before.

14:38.020 --> 14:43.780
I'd like to show you one more method to solve these two problems, kind of a shortcut method

14:43.780 --> 14:45.660
before we go on.

14:45.660 --> 14:52.740
A shortcut relies on the principle that a negative exponent in the numerator corresponds

14:52.740 --> 14:56.540
to a positive exponent in the denominator.

14:56.540 --> 15:03.420
For example, the x to the negative 2 in the numerator here after some manipulations became

15:03.420 --> 15:07.060
an x to the positive 2 in the denominator.

15:07.900 --> 15:15.820
Furthermore, a negative exponent in the denominator is equivalent to a positive exponent in the

15:15.820 --> 15:19.140
numerator.

15:19.140 --> 15:24.020
That's what happened when we had the y to the negative 5 in the denominator and translated

15:24.020 --> 15:28.540
into a y to the positive 5 in the numerator.

15:28.540 --> 15:36.740
Sometimes people like to talk about this principle by saying that you can pass a factor across

15:37.340 --> 15:47.460
the fraction bar by switching the sign of the exponent, that is, making a positive exponent

15:47.460 --> 15:51.900
negative or a negative exponent positive.

15:51.900 --> 15:57.500
Let's see how this principle gives us a shortcut for solving these two problems.

15:57.500 --> 16:05.020
In the first problem, 3x to the minus 2 over x to the 4, we can move the negative exponent

16:05.020 --> 16:09.340
in the numerator and make it a positive exponent in the denominator.

16:09.340 --> 16:16.940
So we get 3 over x to the 4 plus 2 or x to the 6.

16:16.940 --> 16:24.420
In the second example, for y cubed over y to the minus 5, we can change the y to the

16:24.420 --> 16:30.780
minus 5 in the denominator into a y to the 5 in the numerator and get our final answer

16:30.780 --> 16:36.460
of 4 y to the 3 plus 5 or 8.

16:36.460 --> 16:40.820
We'll use this principle again in the next problems.

16:40.820 --> 16:46.380
In this example, notice that I have y's in the numerator and in the denominator and also

16:46.380 --> 16:49.940
z's in the numerator and in the denominator.

16:49.940 --> 16:53.580
In order to simplify it, I'm going to try to get all my y's either in the numerator

16:53.580 --> 16:57.660
or the denominator and similarly for the z's.

16:57.660 --> 17:03.900
Since I have more y's in the denominator, let me move this y to the 3 downstairs and

17:03.900 --> 17:06.380
make it a y to the negative 3.

17:06.380 --> 17:13.900
I'm using the principle here that a positive exponent in the numerator corresponds to a

17:13.900 --> 17:17.420
negative exponent in the denominator.

17:17.420 --> 17:21.340
Now since I have a positive exponent on z in the numerator and a negative exponent in

17:21.340 --> 17:28.100
the denominator and I want to get rid of negative exponents, I'm going to pass the z's to the

17:28.100 --> 17:29.100
numerator.

17:29.100 --> 17:37.860
A z to the minus 2 in the denominator becomes a z to the plus 2 in the numerator.

17:37.860 --> 17:42.660
Notice that my number 7 doesn't move when I do any of these manipulations because it

17:42.660 --> 17:47.620
doesn't have an exponent and the exponent of negative 2, for example, only applies to

17:47.620 --> 17:50.380
the z, not to the 7.

17:50.380 --> 17:54.940
Now that I've got all my z's in the numerator and all my y's in the denominator, it's easy

17:54.940 --> 18:01.660
to clean this up using the product rule and I have my simplified expression.

18:01.660 --> 18:07.340
In this last example, we have a complicated expression raised to a fractional power.

18:07.340 --> 18:12.460
I'm going to start by simplifying the expression inside the parentheses.

18:12.460 --> 18:18.060
I can bring all my y's downstairs and all my x's upstairs and get rid of negative exponents

18:18.060 --> 18:19.060
at the same time.

18:19.060 --> 18:26.740
In other words, I can rewrite this as 25x to the fourth.

18:26.740 --> 18:32.940
I'll bring the y to the minus 5 downstairs and make it y to the fifth on the denominator.

18:32.940 --> 18:39.060
Bring the x to the minus 6 upstairs and make it x to the sixth, the numerator, and then

18:39.060 --> 18:43.020
I still have the y cubed on the denominator.

18:43.020 --> 18:46.240
All that's raised to the 3 half's power.

18:46.240 --> 18:50.720
Using the product rule, I can rewrite the expression on the inside of the parentheses

18:50.720 --> 18:57.080
as 25x to the tenth over y to the eighth.

18:57.080 --> 19:08.680
Recall that we're allowed to distribute an exponent across a product or across a quotient.

19:08.680 --> 19:17.480
When I distribute my 3 half's power, I get 25 to the 3 half's times x to the tenth to

19:17.480 --> 19:24.120
the 3 half's divided by y to the eighth to the 3 half's.

19:24.120 --> 19:31.000
Now the power rule tells me when I have a power to a power, I get to multiply the exponents.

19:31.000 --> 19:38.120
So I can rewrite this as 25 to the 3 half's times x to the tenth times 3 half's over y

19:38.120 --> 19:40.800
to the eighth times 3 half's.

19:40.800 --> 19:47.600
In other words, 25 to the 3 half's times x to the fifteenth over y to the twelfth.

19:47.600 --> 19:53.120
Finally, I need to rewrite 25 to the 3 half's.

19:53.120 --> 20:02.440
As 3 half's can be thought of as 3 times 1 half or as 1 half times 3, I can write 25

20:02.440 --> 20:11.520
to the 3 half's as 25 to the 3 times 1 half or as 25 to the 1 half times 3.

20:11.520 --> 20:17.680
Well using the power rule in reverse, I can think of this as 25 cubed to the 1 half or

20:17.680 --> 20:26.520
as 25 to the 1 half cubed since when I take a power to a power, I multiply the exponents.

20:26.520 --> 20:34.040
25 cubed to the 1 half might be hard to evaluate since 25 cubed is a huge number.

20:34.040 --> 20:39.440
But 25 to the 1 half is just the square root of 25.

20:39.440 --> 20:45.720
So I have the square root of 25 cubed or 5 cubed which is 125.

20:46.080 --> 20:55.840
Therefore, my original expression is going to be 125 x to the 15 over y to the twelfth.

20:55.840 --> 21:02.560
In this video, we use the exponent rules to simplify complicated expressions.

21:02.560 --> 21:07.800
This video goes through a few tricks for simplifying expressions with radicals in them.

21:07.800 --> 21:14.720
Recall that this notation means the nth root of x, so this notation here means the cube

21:14.720 --> 21:22.440
root of 8, the number that when you cube it, you get 8, that number would be 2.

21:22.440 --> 21:28.120
When we write the root sign without a little number, that just means the square root, so

21:28.120 --> 21:31.320
the 2 is implied.

21:31.320 --> 21:38.640
In this case, the square root of 25 is 5 since 5 squared is 25.

21:38.640 --> 21:42.080
Let's start by reviewing some rules for radical expressions.

21:42.080 --> 21:51.720
First, if we have the radical of a product, we can rewrite that as the product of two radicals.

21:51.720 --> 21:59.840
For example, the square root of 9 times 16 is the same thing as a square root of 9 times

21:59.840 --> 22:01.880
the square root of 16.

22:01.880 --> 22:05.800
You can check that both of these evaluate to 12.

22:05.800 --> 22:11.880
Similarly, it's possible to distribute a radical sign across division.

22:11.880 --> 22:18.560
The radical of a divided by b is the same thing as the radical of a divided by the radical

22:18.560 --> 22:20.280
of b.

22:20.280 --> 22:28.880
For example, the cube root of 64 over 8 is the same thing as the cube root of 64 over

22:28.880 --> 22:30.800
the cube root of 8.

22:30.800 --> 22:34.160
And you can check that both of these evaluate to 2.

22:34.160 --> 22:40.760
You have to be a little bit careful though because it's not okay to distribute a radical

22:40.760 --> 22:43.120
sign across addition.

22:43.120 --> 22:49.600
In general, the nth root of a plus b is not equal to the nth root of a plus the nth root

22:49.600 --> 22:50.760
of b.

22:50.760 --> 22:58.240
And similarly, it's not okay to distribute a radical across subtraction.

22:58.240 --> 23:01.520
If you're ever in doubt, you can always check with simple examples.

23:01.520 --> 23:08.320
For example, the square root of 1 plus 1 is not the same thing as a square root of 1 plus

23:08.320 --> 23:10.560
a square root of 1.

23:10.560 --> 23:16.120
The right side evaluates to 1 plus 1 or 2, and the left side is square root of 2, an

23:16.120 --> 23:18.760
irrational number.

23:18.760 --> 23:24.000
The second expression to show that that fails, I don't think it'll work to use the square

23:24.000 --> 23:27.560
root of 1 minus 1, it'll actually hold in that case.

23:27.560 --> 23:32.640
But I can show it's false by using say the square root of 2 minus 1, which does not equal

23:32.640 --> 23:37.160
the square root of 2 minus the square root of 1.

23:37.160 --> 23:41.320
You might notice that these rules for radicals, the ones that hold and the ones that don't

23:41.320 --> 23:45.360
hold, remind you of rules for exponents.

23:45.360 --> 23:50.560
And that's no coincidence because radicals can be written in terms of exponents.

23:50.560 --> 23:55.200
For example, if we look at the first rule, we could rewrite this.

23:55.200 --> 24:02.040
The nth root of a times b is the same thing as the 1 over nth power.

24:02.040 --> 24:08.160
And by exponent rules, I can distribute an exponent across multiplication.

24:08.160 --> 24:15.640
And so this radical rule can be restated completely in terms of an exponent rule.

24:15.640 --> 24:22.640
Similarly, the second rule can be restated in terms of exponents as a over b to the 1

24:22.640 --> 24:28.920
over n is equal to a to the 1 over n divided by b to the 1 over n.

24:28.920 --> 24:35.920
We can use the relationship between radicals and exponents to rewrite a to the m over n.

24:35.920 --> 24:42.680
a to the m over n is the same thing as a to the m with the nth root taken.

24:42.680 --> 24:48.720
It's also the same thing as the nth root of a all taken to the nth power.

24:48.720 --> 24:52.320
To see why that's true, think about exponent rules.

24:52.320 --> 24:58.800
So a to the m over n is the same thing as a to the m taken to the 1 over nth power.

24:58.800 --> 25:03.000
That's because when we take a power to a power, we multiply exponents.

25:03.000 --> 25:09.640
And m times 1 over n is equal to m over n.

25:09.640 --> 25:13.080
But a 1 over nth power is the same thing as an nth root.

25:13.080 --> 25:19.400
And therefore, this expression is the same thing as this expression.

25:19.400 --> 25:22.560
And that proves the first equivalence.

25:22.560 --> 25:31.240
The second equivalence can be proved similarly by writing a to the m over n as a to the 1

25:31.240 --> 25:33.440
over n times m.

25:33.440 --> 25:39.280
Again, this is worked because when I take the power to the power, I multiply exponents

25:39.280 --> 25:43.800
1 over n times m is the same thing as m over n.

25:43.800 --> 25:50.080
But now these two expressions are the same because the 1 over nth power is the same as

25:50.080 --> 25:52.040
the nth root.

25:52.240 --> 25:57.720
One mnemonic for remembering these relationships is flower over root.

25:57.720 --> 26:01.200
So flower is like power and root is like root.

26:01.200 --> 26:04.240
So that tells us we can write a fractional exponent.

26:04.240 --> 26:10.360
The m becomes the power and the n becomes the root in either of these two orders.

26:10.360 --> 26:13.280
Now let's use these rules in some examples.

26:13.280 --> 26:20.640
If we want to compute 25 to the negative three-halves power, well, first I'll use my exponent rule

26:20.640 --> 26:27.400
to rewrite that negative exponent as 1 over 25 to the three-halves power.

26:27.400 --> 26:37.640
Next, I'll use the power over root mnemonic to rewrite this as 25 to the third power square-rooted

26:37.640 --> 26:43.760
or as 25 square-rooted to the third power.

26:43.760 --> 26:48.760
I wrote the twos there for the square root for emphasis, but most of the time people

26:48.760 --> 26:55.240
will omit this and just write the square root without a little number there.

26:55.240 --> 26:59.680
Now I could use either of these two equivalent expressions to continue, but I'd rather

26:59.680 --> 27:03.160
use this one because it's easier to compute without a calculator.

27:03.160 --> 27:05.880
The square root of 25 is just five.

27:05.880 --> 27:12.680
Five cubed is 125, so my answer is 1 over 125.

27:12.680 --> 27:17.680
If I tried to compute the cube of 25 first, I'd get a huge number.

27:17.680 --> 27:22.480
In general, it's usually easier to compute the root before the power when you're working

27:22.480 --> 27:25.960
without a calculator.

27:25.960 --> 27:31.480
Now let's do an example simplifying a more complicated expression with exponents in it.

27:31.480 --> 27:36.920
I want to take the square root of all this stuff, and since I don't really like negative

27:36.920 --> 27:42.640
exponents, I'm first going to rewrite this as the square root of 60x squared y to the

27:42.640 --> 27:48.400
sixth over z to the 11th, so I'll change that negative exponent to a positive exponent

27:48.400 --> 27:52.880
by moving this factor to the denominator.

27:52.880 --> 27:57.520
Now when you're asked to simplify a radical expression, that generally means to pull as

27:57.520 --> 28:02.040
much as possible out of the radical sign.

28:02.040 --> 28:07.040
To pull things out of the square root sign, I'm going to factor my numbers and try to

28:07.040 --> 28:12.480
rewrite everything in terms of squares as much as possible since the square root of

28:12.480 --> 28:15.840
a square, those two operations undo each other.

28:15.840 --> 28:17.760
So I'll show you what I mean.

28:17.760 --> 28:26.640
First, I'll factor 60, so 60 is going to be 2 squared times 3 times 5, and I'll just

28:26.640 --> 28:31.360
copy everything over for now.

28:31.360 --> 28:36.600
Now I'll break things up into squares as much as possible, so I've got a 2 squared times

28:36.600 --> 28:40.960
3 times 5, I've already got an x squared, I'll write the y to the sixth as y squared

28:40.960 --> 28:46.640
times y squared times y squared, and I'll write the z to the 11th as z squared times

28:46.640 --> 28:53.720
z squared, I guess 5 times 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 times 1 extra z.

28:53.720 --> 28:59.520
That should add up to z to the 11th if I add all those exponents together.

28:59.520 --> 29:04.360
Now I know that I can distribute my radical sign across multiplication and division, so

29:04.360 --> 29:09.960
I'll write this with a zillion different radicals here.

29:10.200 --> 29:16.560
Every time I see the square root of something squared, I can just cancel those square roots

29:16.560 --> 29:19.840
and the squares out and get what's left here.

29:19.840 --> 29:27.360
So after doing that cancellation, I get 2 times the square root of 3 times 5 times x times

29:27.360 --> 29:36.920
y times y times y over z times itself, I guess 5 times, times the square root of z.

29:36.920 --> 29:42.240
Now I can clean that up with exponents, I'll write that as the square root of 15, I guess

29:42.240 --> 29:51.240
2 times the square root of 15 times x times y cubed over z to the fifth, the square root

29:51.240 --> 29:52.240
of z.

29:52.240 --> 29:58.920
I'm going to leave this example as is, but sometimes people prefer to rewrite radical

29:58.920 --> 30:04.880
expressions without radical signs in the denominator, that's called rationalizing the denominator.

30:04.880 --> 30:09.000
I won't do it here, but I'll show you how to do it in the next example.

30:09.000 --> 30:12.280
This example asks us to rationalize the denominator.

30:12.280 --> 30:20.640
That means to rewrite as an equivalent expression without radical signs in the denominator.

30:20.640 --> 30:28.040
To get rid of the radical sign in the denominator, I want to multiply my denominator by square

30:28.040 --> 30:32.800
root of x, but I can't just multiply the denominator willy-nilly by something unless

30:32.800 --> 30:37.400
I multiply the numerator by the same thing, so that I'm just multiplying my expression

30:37.400 --> 30:42.840
by 1 in a fancy form and I don't change the value of my expression.

30:42.840 --> 30:50.400
Now if I just multiply together numerators, 3x squared of x, and multiply denominators,

30:50.400 --> 30:55.280
square root of x times square root of x is the square root of x squared, square root

30:55.280 --> 30:58.280
of x squared is just x.

30:58.280 --> 31:04.120
Now I can cancel my x's from the numerator and denominator and my final answer is 3 times

31:04.120 --> 31:05.440
the square root of x.

31:05.440 --> 31:11.920
I rationalize my denominator and the process got a nicer looking expression.

31:11.920 --> 31:18.160
In this video, we went over the rules for radicals and we simplified some radical expressions

31:18.160 --> 31:26.640
by working with fractional exponents, pulling things out of the radical sign, and rationalizing

31:26.640 --> 31:29.760
the denominator.

31:29.760 --> 31:32.120
Hi class, happy snow day.

31:32.120 --> 31:36.400
Since class is canceled, I'm putting together this video with some additional examples on

31:36.400 --> 31:39.200
simplifying radicals that I would have done in class.

31:39.200 --> 31:43.880
I hope this will help you complete your assignment that's due tonight.

31:43.880 --> 31:48.320
Let's start with this example, asking us to simplify the product of two radicals.

31:48.320 --> 31:53.000
I could simplify each radical separately and then multiply things together, but I think

31:53.000 --> 31:57.200
it'll save me trouble if I multiply first and then simplify.

31:57.200 --> 32:06.960
So I'm going to multiply these together since the product of two radicals is the radical

32:06.960 --> 32:11.280
of the product, assuming everything's positive.

32:11.280 --> 32:17.200
I can rewrite my expression as the square root of, let's see, 5 times 15, that's going

32:17.200 --> 32:25.200
to be 75, x times x cubed, that's x to the fourth because when I multiply two expressions,

32:25.200 --> 32:31.160
I add the exponents and y to the seventh times y cubed, that's going to be y to the tenth

32:31.160 --> 32:33.960
since seven plus three is ten.

32:33.960 --> 32:38.280
Now I want to simplify by pulling as much out of the square root sign as I can.

32:38.280 --> 32:41.720
If 75 were a perfect square, I could just take the square root of it, but since it's

32:41.720 --> 32:48.440
not, I'm going to factor it, so 75, let's see, that's 25 times three and 25 is five

32:48.440 --> 32:53.240
times five, so I can write that as five squared times three.

32:53.240 --> 32:58.720
Now I can write my square root, let's see, so that's five squared times three times x

32:58.720 --> 33:01.440
to the fourth times y to the tenth.

33:01.440 --> 33:07.920
Now since I know that the square root of anything squared is just that original thing, assuming

33:07.920 --> 33:14.880
that the variables are positive, I can maybe rewrite this as by breaking everything up

33:14.880 --> 33:16.620
into a bunch of squares.

33:16.620 --> 33:20.400
So let's see, I already have a square here, there's no hope for the three, the x to the

33:20.400 --> 33:24.920
fourth I can write that as x squared times x squared, right, that makes four x's and

33:24.920 --> 33:31.320
y to the tenth, I'm going to need five y squareds to get ten y's out of that, one,

33:31.320 --> 33:34.480
two, three, y squared, y squared.

33:34.480 --> 33:40.680
Now splitting up the square root back into a product of a bunch of square roots, every

33:40.680 --> 33:44.560
time I see the square root of something squared I just replace it with a thing, so that's

33:44.560 --> 33:52.040
five, I still have the square root of three, that gives me x, x, y, y, y, y, y, and I can

33:52.040 --> 33:57.360
rewrite that as five, square root of three times x squared, y to the fifth, so that's

33:57.360 --> 34:00.680
one way to simplify this expression.

34:00.680 --> 34:06.840
Alternatively, I could complete this problem a little bit faster the following way, I could

34:06.840 --> 34:12.800
go ahead and break up my five squared times three times x to the fourth times y to the

34:12.800 --> 34:20.520
tenth, I'm going to break that up, go ahead and break that up as a product of square roots.

34:20.520 --> 34:25.920
Now the square root of five squared is certainly five, square root of three stays the same,

34:26.000 --> 34:29.800
square root of x to the fourth is going to be x squared, there are a couple ways to

34:29.800 --> 34:35.360
see that, one way is the square root of x fourth, that's x to the fourth to the one

34:35.360 --> 34:40.720
half power, since square roots are the same as half powers, and now I can multiply my

34:40.720 --> 34:46.160
exponents to get my x squared, or alternatively I can think of that because the square root

34:46.160 --> 34:50.640
of x to the fourth, that's the square root of x squared squared, since I take a power

34:50.640 --> 34:55.040
to a power I multiply my exponents, square root of something squared is just a thing,

34:55.040 --> 34:59.800
so that's x squared. Similarly the square root of y to the tenth, that's going to be

34:59.800 --> 35:04.320
y to the fifth, notice I'm just taking half of the exponent, and you can see that the

35:04.320 --> 35:12.320
same way, that's because if I do the square root of y to the tenth, that's the same thing

35:12.320 --> 35:19.480
as y to the tenth to the one half, which is y to the tenth times one half, or y to the

35:19.480 --> 35:24.920
fifth, or alternatively you can think of this as the square root of y to the tenth is the

35:24.920 --> 35:31.240
square root of y to the fifth squared, which is y to the fifth. So if it weren't for all

35:31.240 --> 35:35.200
that little side work I did, that would have, this would have been a faster way to get to

35:35.200 --> 35:40.240
the same answer as before.

35:40.240 --> 35:45.480
The next few examples have to do with rewriting expressions by rationalizing denominators.

35:45.480 --> 35:50.000
Please pause the video for a moment and see if you can decide if these two expressions

35:50.000 --> 35:56.720
represent the same thing or different things. In fact, they represent the same thing, and

35:56.720 --> 36:03.120
we can see that, that we can transform a to look like b by doing something called rationalizing

36:03.120 --> 36:06.960
denominator, trying to get all the square roots out of the denominator at the expense

36:06.960 --> 36:10.760
of maybe putting some more squares in the numerator. So to rationalize the denominator

36:10.760 --> 36:16.200
in this case, since there's just that one, that one piece with square roots in it, I'm

36:16.200 --> 36:21.440
going to multiply both the top and the bottom by the square root of y, the thing that has

36:21.440 --> 36:27.320
the square root around it. If I multiply the bottom by the square root of y, I have to

36:27.320 --> 36:31.120
multiply the top also so I won't change the value of my expression. This way I'm just

36:31.120 --> 36:38.800
multiplying by one in a fancy form. Now when I multiply fractions I multiply the numerator,

36:38.800 --> 36:42.440
and I multiply the denominator. Well let's see, the square root of y times the square

36:42.440 --> 36:53.120
root of y, that's the square root of y squared, which is the same thing as just y. So I can

36:53.120 --> 36:58.520
bring my square roots together and get three square root of xy over five y, which is exactly

36:58.520 --> 37:04.760
the second expression. Here are two even crazier expressions, the last one's especially crazy.

37:04.760 --> 37:10.960
Again, try to decide if these two represent the same thing or represent a different thing.

37:10.960 --> 37:16.400
Kind of surprisingly, they actually represent the same thing still. And we can transform

37:16.400 --> 37:22.280
one to two by again rationalizing the denominator, this time we're going to use something called

37:22.280 --> 37:27.320
the conjugate. And that's because we have a difference in this case of two expressions,

37:27.320 --> 37:33.120
one of which has a square root in it. So when I have the difference of two expressions,

37:33.120 --> 37:40.000
one of which with a square root in it, I find the conjugate by taking the sum of those two

37:40.040 --> 37:45.840
expressions. If instead I had had the sum of two expressions, then the conjugate would

37:45.840 --> 37:54.040
be the difference. Okay, so I'm going to multiply the top and the bottom by this conjugate of

37:54.040 --> 38:00.760
the denominator. So let me move down here and rewrite with more space. Once again, I have

38:00.760 --> 38:04.920
to multiply the numerator and the denominator by the same thing so that I'm not changing

38:04.920 --> 38:09.120
the value of my expression, I'm just multiplying by one in a fancy form. Now let's look at

38:09.120 --> 38:13.560
what happens in the denominator first, I have to multiply three by three, three by the

38:13.560 --> 38:18.200
square root of a, negative square root of a by three, and negative square root of a by

38:18.200 --> 38:23.200
square root of a. So that's going to give me three times three is nine plus three square

38:23.200 --> 38:31.800
root of a minus three square root of a minus square root of a squared. So in a moment that

38:31.800 --> 38:38.360
I'll simplify to these things cancel. So that'll be nine minus square root of a squared is

38:38.360 --> 38:42.960
a. Notice how I've gotten rid of the square roots of the denominator, which is why it's

38:42.960 --> 38:49.360
called rationalized denominator. We get rid of the, I don't know, irrational numbers,

38:49.360 --> 38:52.900
the radical signs. Okay, let's look at the numerator. So again, we have to, we're going

38:52.900 --> 38:57.480
to have four terms, this times this, this times that, b times three, b times square

38:57.480 --> 39:08.200
root of a. That gives us 15 a plus five a square root of a plus three b plus b square

39:08.200 --> 39:15.040
root of a. Now that's starting to look similar to this expression here. And in fact, it we

39:15.040 --> 39:19.760
can see that it's exactly the same thing by turning our radicals into exponents. So let's

39:19.760 --> 39:26.440
see, we still have the 15 a. This is the same thing as five a times a to the one half, we

39:26.440 --> 39:33.880
still got the three b. And we've got b times a to the one half. And now let's see a times

39:33.880 --> 39:39.880
a to the one half here, that's really, I can add my exponents. So that's going to be five

39:39.880 --> 39:47.080
a to the one plus one half is three halves, three b, b, a to the one half. And that's

39:47.080 --> 39:53.520
exactly what I have in this expression, just in a slightly different order. So these really

39:53.520 --> 40:00.800
are the same, kind of weird. Please pause the video and try your hand at rationalizing

40:00.800 --> 40:07.400
the denominator of this expression. Since we have a sum of two expressions in the denominator,

40:07.400 --> 40:13.160
we want to multiply the numerator and denominator by the conjugate of the denominator. So that's

40:13.160 --> 40:19.640
squared of a minus one. Now when we multiply out the numerator, we'll get four terms,

40:19.640 --> 40:29.280
squared of a squared. Let's see minus the square of a. And now we have seven times

40:29.280 --> 40:38.040
the square of a. And finally, seven times minus one, that's minus seven. On the denominator,

40:38.040 --> 40:44.480
we get the square of a squared minus the square of a plus the square of a minus one. Notice

40:44.560 --> 40:50.640
how the square root things cancel, just like before, that's the whole magic of using the

40:50.640 --> 40:55.240
conjugate, it makes those square roots cancel out. So now on the numerator, squared of

40:55.240 --> 41:00.640
a squared is a minus the square of a plus seven squared of a, that's a net of six square

41:00.640 --> 41:07.760
of a minus seven. And then on the denominator, we have a minus one, we've gotten rid of the

41:07.760 --> 41:12.400
square roots on the denominator, rationalize the denominator, I'm happy leaving the square

41:12.480 --> 41:16.960
root in the numerator, but if you want to, you can change it to a exponent instead, it's really

41:16.960 --> 41:22.320
up to you. That's all the examples I have today, I hope you enjoy the snow, which hasn't started

41:22.320 --> 41:28.040
yet for me. And please do spend some time to finish your Alex objective if you haven't done it

41:28.040 --> 41:36.040
already. Goodbye. This video goes over some common methods of factoring. Recall that factoring an

41:36.040 --> 41:42.280
expression means to write it as a product. So we could factor the number 30 by writing it as six

41:42.320 --> 41:50.040
times five, or we could factor it more completely by writing it as two times three times five. As

41:50.040 --> 41:58.120
another example, we could factor the expression x squared plus five x plus six, by writing it as x

41:58.120 --> 42:06.840
plus two times x plus three. In this video, I'll go over how I get from here to here, how I know how

42:06.840 --> 42:13.280
to do the factoring. But for right now, I just want to review how I can go backwards, how I can

42:13.280 --> 42:19.200
check that the factoring is correct. And that's just by multiplying out or distributing. If I

42:19.200 --> 42:25.920
distribute x plus two times x plus three, then I multiply x by x that gives me x squared, x times

42:25.920 --> 42:32.920
three gives me three x, two times x gives me two x and two times three gives me six. So that

42:32.920 --> 42:39.520
simplifies to x squared plus five x plus six, which checks out with what I started with. So you can

42:39.520 --> 42:45.720
think of factoring as the opposite of distributing out. And you can always check your factoring by

42:45.720 --> 42:52.640
distributing or multiplying out. A bit of terminology, when I think of an expression as a sum of a

42:52.640 --> 42:58.880
bunch of things, then the things I sum up are called the terms. But if I think of the same

42:58.880 --> 43:05.520
expression as a product of things, then the things that I multiply together are called

43:05.520 --> 43:13.440
factors. Now let's get started on techniques of factoring. When I have to factor something, I

43:13.440 --> 43:19.120
always like to start by pulling out the greatest common factor. The greatest common factor means

43:19.120 --> 43:26.240
the largest thing that divides each of the terms. In this first example, the largest thing that

43:26.240 --> 43:38.200
divides both 15 and 25x is five. So the GCF is five. So I pull the five out, and then I divide each

43:38.200 --> 43:47.280
of the terms by that number. And so I get three plus five x. Pause the video for a moment and see

43:47.280 --> 43:54.440
if you can find the greatest common factor of x squared y and y squared x cubed. The biggest

43:54.480 --> 44:03.560
thing that divides both x squared y and y squared x cubed is going to be x squared times y. One way

44:03.560 --> 44:09.880
to find this is to look for the power of x that's smallest in each of these terms. So that's x

44:09.880 --> 44:17.080
squared. And the power of y that's smallest in each of these terms is just y to the one or y. Now

44:17.080 --> 44:24.680
if I factor out the x squared y from each of the terms, that's like dividing each term by x squared

44:24.680 --> 44:30.680
y. If I divide the first term by x squared y, I just get one. If I divide the second term by x

44:30.680 --> 44:37.880
squared y, I'm going to be left with an x and a y. I'll write this out on the side just to make it

44:37.880 --> 44:47.320
more clear y squared x cubed over x squared y. That's like two y's on and three x's on the top and

44:47.320 --> 44:56.200
two x's and a y on the bottom. So I'm left with just an x and a y. So I'll write the x y here,

44:56.200 --> 45:04.280
and I factored my expression. As always, I can check my answer by multiplying out. So if I multiply

45:04.280 --> 45:11.720
out my factored expression, I get x squared y is the first term and the second term. I get x,

45:11.720 --> 45:16.680
there now let's see three x's multiplied together and two y's multiplied together,

45:16.680 --> 45:23.400
and that checks out with what I started with. The next technique of factoring I'd like to go over

45:23.400 --> 45:29.880
is factoring by grouping. In this example, notice that we have four terms factoring by grouping

45:29.880 --> 45:35.560
is a handy method to look at if you have four terms in your expression you need to factor.

45:37.000 --> 45:41.720
In order to factor by grouping, I'm first going to factor out the greatest common factor of the

45:41.720 --> 45:47.000
first two terms, and then separately factor out the greatest common factor of the last two terms.

45:47.880 --> 45:55.000
The greatest common factor of x cubed and three x squared is x squared. So I factor out the x

45:55.000 --> 46:02.600
squared and I get x plus three. And now the greatest common factor of four x and 12 is just four.

46:03.320 --> 46:12.760
So I factor out the four from those two terms. Notice that the factor of x plus three now appears

46:12.760 --> 46:19.880
in both pieces. So I can factor out the greatest common factor of x plus three, I think I'll factor

46:19.880 --> 46:27.000
it out on the left side instead of the right. And now I have an x squared from this first piece,

46:27.000 --> 46:35.480
and I have a four from this second piece, and that completes my factoring by grouping.

46:36.520 --> 46:41.640
You might wonder if we could factor further by factoring the expression x squared plus four.

46:41.640 --> 46:47.480
But in fact, as we'll see later, this expression, which is a sum of two squares, x squared plus

46:47.480 --> 46:54.440
two squared does not factor any further over the integers. Next, we'll do some factoring of

46:54.440 --> 47:02.200
quadratics. A quadratic is an expression with a squared term, just a term with x in it, and a

47:02.200 --> 47:12.200
constant term with no x's in it. I'd like to factor this expression as a product of x plus or minus

47:12.200 --> 47:19.720
some number times x plus or minus some other number. The key idea is that if I can find those

47:19.720 --> 47:24.440
two numbers, then if I were to distribute out this expression, those two numbers would have to

47:24.440 --> 47:31.960
multiply to give me my constant term of eight. And these two numbers would end up having to add

47:31.960 --> 47:38.040
to give me my negative six, because when I multiply out, this number will be a coefficient of x and

47:38.040 --> 47:42.280
this number will be also another coefficient of x, they'll add together to the negative six.

47:44.600 --> 47:48.840
So if I look at all the pairs of numbers that multiply together to give me eight,

47:49.480 --> 47:56.760
so that could be one and eight, two and four, four and two, but that's really the same thing

47:56.760 --> 48:01.720
as I had before. And that's sort of the same thing I had before. I shouldn't forget the negatives,

48:01.720 --> 48:06.200
I could have negative one, negative eight, or I could have negative two, negative four, those

48:06.200 --> 48:12.280
also multiply together to give me eight. Now I just have to find, see if there's a pair of these

48:12.280 --> 48:20.280
numbers that add to negative six. And it's not hard to see that these ones will work. So now I can

48:20.280 --> 48:29.160
write out my factoring as that would be x minus two times x minus four. And it's always a good idea

48:29.240 --> 48:36.520
to check by multiplying out, I'm going to get x squared minus four x minus two x plus eight.

48:36.520 --> 48:43.080
And that works out to just what I want. Now the second example is a bit more complicated because

48:43.080 --> 48:49.320
now my leading coefficient, my coefficient of x squared is not just one, it's the number 10.

48:50.680 --> 48:54.040
Now there are lots of different methods for approaching a problem like this. And I'm just

48:54.040 --> 48:59.720
going to show you one method, my favorite method that uses factoring by grouping. But to start out,

48:59.720 --> 49:05.880
I'm going to multiply my coefficient of x squared by my constant term. So I'm multiplying 10 by negative

49:05.880 --> 49:13.080
six. That gives me negative 60. And I'll also take my coefficient of x, so you'll number 11,

49:13.720 --> 49:19.560
and write that down here. Now I'm going to look for two numbers that multiply to give me negative

49:19.560 --> 49:26.280
60 and add to give me 11. You might notice that this is exactly what we were doing in the previous

49:26.280 --> 49:31.480
problem. It's just here we didn't have to multiply the coefficient of x squared by eight, because the

49:31.480 --> 49:37.560
coefficient of x squared was just one. So to find the two numbers that multiply to negative 60 and

49:37.560 --> 49:43.480
add to 11, you might just be able to come up with them in your head thinking about it. But if not,

49:43.480 --> 49:49.640
you can figure it out pretty systematically by writing out all the factors, pairs of factors,

49:49.640 --> 49:56.040
that multiply to negative 60. So I can start with negative one and 60, negative two and 30,

49:56.040 --> 50:04.200
negative three and 20, and keep going like this until I have found factors that actually add

50:04.200 --> 50:09.480
together to give me the number 11. And now that I look at it, I've already found them.

50:10.440 --> 50:17.160
15 minus four gives me 11. So I don't have to continue with my chart of factors.

50:17.960 --> 50:25.160
Now, once I found those factors, I write out my expression 10x squared, but instead of writing 11x,

50:25.160 --> 50:34.040
I write negative 4x plus 15x. Now I copy down the negative six. Notice that negative 4x plus 15x

50:34.040 --> 50:41.000
equals 11x, that's how I chose those numbers. And so this expression is, evaluates as the same

50:41.000 --> 50:46.760
as this expression. I haven't changed my expression. But I have turned it into something that I can

50:46.760 --> 50:51.800
apply factoring by grouping on, look, I've got four terms here. And so if I factor out my greatest

50:51.800 --> 50:58.760
common factor of my first two terms, that's, let's see, I think it's 2x. So I factor out the 2x,

50:58.760 --> 51:06.120
I get 5x minus two. And then I factor out the greatest common factor of 15x and negative six,

51:06.120 --> 51:13.480
that would be three, I get a 5x minus two again, this is working beautifully. So I have a 5x minus

51:13.480 --> 51:22.840
two in each part. And so I put the 5x minus two on the right, and I put what's left from these terms

51:22.840 --> 51:28.760
in here. So that's 2x plus three. And I have factored my expression.

51:31.400 --> 51:35.560
There are a couple of special kinds of expressions that appear frequently,

51:35.560 --> 51:40.040
that it's handy to just memorize the formula for. So the first one is the difference of squares.

51:40.040 --> 51:47.320
If you see something of the form a squared minus b squared, then you can factor that as a plus b

51:47.320 --> 51:53.960
times a minus b. And let's just check that that works. If I do a plus b times a minus b and multiply

51:53.960 --> 52:03.800
that out, I get a squared minus a b plus b a minus b squared, and those middle two terms cancel out.

52:03.800 --> 52:09.480
So it gives me back the difference of squares just like I want it. So for this first example,

52:10.120 --> 52:17.240
if I think of x squared minus 16 as x squared minus four squared, then I can see that's a

52:17.240 --> 52:23.960
difference of squares. And I can immediately write it as x plus four times x minus four. And the second

52:23.960 --> 52:32.520
example, nine p squared minus one, that's the same thing as three p squared minus one squared.

52:32.520 --> 52:41.800
So that's three p plus one times three p minus one. Notice that if I have a sum of squares,

52:43.160 --> 52:50.760
for example, x squared plus four, which is x squared plus two squared,

52:50.760 --> 52:57.560
then that does not factor. The difference of squares formula doesn't apply. And there is no

52:57.560 --> 53:04.280
formula that applies for a sum of squares. There is, however, a formula for both a difference of

53:04.280 --> 53:12.760
cubes and a sum of cubes. The difference of cubes formula, a cube minus b cubed is a minus b times

53:12.760 --> 53:20.200
a squared plus a b plus b squared. The formula for the sum of cubes is pretty much the same,

53:20.280 --> 53:27.640
you just switch the negative and positive sign here and here. So that gives us a plus b times

53:27.640 --> 53:35.160
a squared minus a b plus b squared. As usual, you can check these formulas by multiplying out.

53:35.960 --> 53:43.080
Let's look at one example of using these formulas, y cube plus 27 is actually a sum of two cubes,

53:43.080 --> 53:50.840
because it's y cubed plus three cubed. So I can factor it using the sum of cubes formula

53:50.840 --> 53:59.880
by plugging in y for a and three for b. That gives me y plus three times y squared minus

53:59.880 --> 54:06.200
y times three plus three squared. And I can clean that up a little bit to read y plus three times

54:06.200 --> 54:13.960
y squared minus three y plus nine. So in this video, we went over several methods of factoring.

54:13.960 --> 54:21.640
We did factoring out the greatest common factor. We did factoring by grouping. We did factoring

54:21.640 --> 54:33.080
quadratics. And we did a difference of squares. And we did a difference and a sum of cubes.

54:33.080 --> 54:39.480
In more complicated problems, you may need to apply several of these techniques in order

54:39.480 --> 54:43.720
to get through a single problem. For example, you might need to start by pulling out a greatest

54:43.720 --> 54:51.640
common factor, and then do a factoring of quadratics or something similar. Now go forth and factor.

54:52.840 --> 54:59.080
This video gives some additional examples of factoring. Please pause the video and decide

54:59.080 --> 55:04.120
which of these first five expressions factor and which one does not.

55:06.120 --> 55:11.960
The first expression can be factored by pulling out a common factor of x from each term.

55:13.320 --> 55:22.520
So that becomes x times x plus one. The second example can be factored as a difference of two

55:22.520 --> 55:30.600
squares. Since x squared minus twenty five is something squared minus something else squared.

55:30.600 --> 55:37.080
And we know that anytime we have something like a squared minus b squared, that's a plus b times

55:37.080 --> 55:46.200
a minus b. So we can factor this as x plus five times x minus five. The third one is a sum of

55:46.200 --> 55:52.840
two squares. There's no way to factor a sum of two squares over real numbers. So this is the one

55:52.840 --> 56:01.000
that does not factor. Just for completeness, let's look at the next two. This next one does factor

56:01.000 --> 56:08.280
by grouping. When we factor by grouping, we pull the biggest common factor out of the first two

56:08.360 --> 56:15.240
terms. That would be an x squared. That becomes x squared times x plus two. And then we factor

56:15.240 --> 56:21.720
as much as we can out of the next two terms. That would be a three times x plus two. Notice that the

56:21.720 --> 56:29.000
x plus two factor now occurs in both of the resulting terms. So we can pull that x plus two out

56:29.960 --> 56:39.480
and get x plus two times x squared plus three. We can't factor any further because x squared plus

56:39.480 --> 56:47.720
three doesn't factor. Finally, we have a quadratic. This also factors. And I like to factor these

56:48.440 --> 56:57.080
also using a factoring by grouping trick. So first, what I do is I multiply the coefficient of x

56:57.160 --> 57:04.280
squared and the constant term five times eight is 40. I'll write that on the top of my x. Now I

57:04.280 --> 57:10.200
take the coefficient of the x term that's negative 14. And I write that on the bottom part of the x.

57:10.840 --> 57:19.480
Now I'm looking for two numbers that multiply to 40 and add to negative 14. Sometimes I can just

57:19.480 --> 57:27.080
guess numbers like this. But if not, I start writing out factors of 40. So factors of 40,

57:27.080 --> 57:34.200
I could do one times 40. Well, now I just noticed I'm trying to add to a negative number. So if I

57:34.200 --> 57:38.360
use two positive factors, there's no way there's going to add to a negative number. It's better

57:38.360 --> 57:45.080
for me to use negative numbers that factor 40. A negative times a negative still multiplies to 40,

57:45.080 --> 57:50.760
but they have a chance of adding to a negative number. So but negative one and negative 40 of

57:50.760 --> 57:54.760
course don't work. They don't add to negative 14. They add to negative 41. So let me try some other

57:54.760 --> 58:00.760
factors. The next biggest number that divides 40 besides one is two. So I'll try negative two and

58:00.760 --> 58:08.920
negative 20. Those add to negative 22. That doesn't work. Next one that divides 40 would be four. So

58:08.920 --> 58:15.800
I'll try negative four and negative 10. Aha, we have a winner. So negative four plus negative 10

58:15.800 --> 58:22.040
is negative 14. Negative four times negative 10 is positive 40. We've got it. All right. So the next

58:22.040 --> 58:30.200
step is to use factoring by grouping. We're going to first split up this negative 14 x as negative

58:30.200 --> 58:37.880
four x minus 10 x and carry down the eight and the five x squared. Notice that this works because

58:37.880 --> 58:46.280
I picked negative four negative 10 to add up to negative 14. So so negative four x minus 10 x will

58:46.280 --> 58:51.640
add up to negative 14 x. So I've got the same expression just just expanded out a little bit.

58:51.640 --> 58:56.680
Now I have four terms I can do factoring by grouping. So I can group the first two terms

58:56.680 --> 59:02.280
and factor out the biggest thing I can. That would be an x times five x minus four. And now I'll

59:02.280 --> 59:09.320
factor the biggest thing I can out of these two numbers including the the negative. So that becomes

59:09.320 --> 59:16.760
let's see I can factor out a negative two and that becomes five x minus four since negative two times

59:16.760 --> 59:23.240
minus four is eight. All right, I've got the same five x plus four in both my terms. So factoring

59:23.240 --> 59:28.840
by grouping is going swimmingly. I can factor out the five x minus four from both those terms

59:28.840 --> 59:34.840
and I get the x minus two and I factored this quadratic. If I want to of course I can always

59:34.840 --> 59:42.840
check my work by distributing out by multiplying out. So a check here would be multiplying five x

59:42.840 --> 59:51.960
times x is five x squared five x minus times minus two is minus 10 x minus four times x is minus

59:51.960 --> 59:58.440
four x and minus four times minus two is plus eight. So let's see this does check out to exactly

59:58.440 --> 01:00:08.360
what it should be. So that was the method of factoring a quadratic. And all of these factor

01:00:08.360 --> 01:00:16.680
except for the sum of squares. So we saw that factoring by grouping is handy for factoring

01:00:17.640 --> 01:00:25.240
this expression here. It was also handy for factoring the quadratic indirectly after splitting up

01:00:27.560 --> 01:00:37.160
the middle term into two terms. So how can you tell when an expression is is appropriate to

01:00:37.160 --> 01:00:43.400
factor by grouping? There's an easy way to tell that it might be a candidate and that's that it

01:00:43.400 --> 01:00:50.040
has four terms. So if you see four terms or in the case of the quadratic you can split it up into

01:00:50.040 --> 01:00:53.960
four terms then that's a good candidate for factoring by grouping because you can group the

01:00:53.960 --> 01:00:58.920
first two terms, group the second two terms. Factoring by grouping won't always work on

01:01:00.840 --> 01:01:06.920
expressions with four terms but that's like the first thing to look for. So let's just review

01:01:06.920 --> 01:01:11.800
what are the same main techniques of factoring. We saw these on the previous page. We saw there was

01:01:11.800 --> 01:01:16.120
pull out common factors. There's difference of squares.

01:01:18.600 --> 01:01:24.120
There's factoring by grouping. There's factoring quadratics.

01:01:26.760 --> 01:01:33.240
And one more that I didn't mention is factoring sums and differences of cubes.

01:01:33.880 --> 01:01:41.720
That uses the formulas a cubed minus b cubed is a minus b times a squared plus a b plus b

01:01:41.720 --> 01:01:49.800
squared and a cubed plus b cubed is a plus b times a squared minus a b plus b squared.

01:01:51.800 --> 01:01:58.280
One important tip when factoring, I always recommend doing this first. Pull out the common

01:01:59.160 --> 01:02:04.760
factors first. That'll simplify things in making the rest of factoring easier.

01:02:05.320 --> 01:02:10.920
One more tip is that you might need to do several of these factoring techniques in one problem.

01:02:10.920 --> 01:02:17.000
For example, you might have to first pull out a common factor then factor a difference of squares

01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:21.080
and then you might notice that one of your factors is itself a difference of squares and you have to

01:02:21.080 --> 01:02:27.800
apply a difference of squares again. So don't stop when you factor a little bit. Keep factoring as

01:02:27.800 --> 01:02:34.120
far as you can go. Here are some extra examples of factoring quadratics for you to practice.

01:02:34.120 --> 01:02:41.640
Please pause the video and give these a try. For the first one, let's multiply two times negative

01:02:41.640 --> 01:02:50.600
14. That gives us negative 28 and then we'll bring the three down in the bottom of the x. Now

01:02:50.600 --> 01:02:56.360
we're looking for two numbers that multiply to negative 28 and add to three. Well to multiply

01:02:56.360 --> 01:03:01.240
two numbers to get a negative 28 will need one of them to be negative and one of them to be positive.

01:03:01.240 --> 01:03:11.080
So let's see one negative 128 or one negative 28. Those don't work. Let's see negative 214 or two

01:03:11.080 --> 01:03:15.960
negative 14. Those don't work. Hey, I just noticed the positive number had better be bigger than the

01:03:15.960 --> 01:03:20.840
negative number so they add to a positive number. Let's see what comes next. How about

01:03:21.160 --> 01:03:30.760
negative 4 times 7, 4 times negative 7. I think 4, negative 4 times 7 will work. So I'll write

01:03:30.760 --> 01:03:42.920
those here negative 4, 7. Copy down the 2 z squared and I'll split up the 3 z into negative 4 z plus

01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:52.200
7 z and then minus 14. Now factoring by grouping pull out a 2 z that becomes z minus 2 pull out a 7

01:03:52.200 --> 01:04:01.320
and that becomes z minus 2 again looking good. I've got 2 z plus 7 times z minus 2 as my factored

01:04:01.320 --> 01:04:08.760
expression. My second expression I could work at the same way drawing my x and factoring by grouping

01:04:08.760 --> 01:04:14.520
that kind of thing but it's actually going to be easier if I notice first that I can pull out a

01:04:14.520 --> 01:04:19.480
common factor from all of my terms. That'll make things a lot simpler to deal with. So notice that

01:04:19.480 --> 01:04:23.800
a 5 divides each of these terms and in fact I'm going to go ahead and pull out the negative 5 because

01:04:23.800 --> 01:04:27.560
I don't like having negatives in front of my squared term. So I'm going to pull out a common

01:04:27.560 --> 01:04:33.560
factor of negative 5. Again, it would work if I forgot to do this but it would be a lot more

01:04:33.560 --> 01:04:40.840
complicated. So negative 5 v squared this becomes minus, no this becomes plus 9v

01:04:41.560 --> 01:04:47.480
since 9 times negative 5 is negative 45 and this becomes minus 10 since negative 10 times

01:04:47.480 --> 01:04:53.400
negative 5 is positive 50. Now I can start my x and my factoring by grouping or I can use kind of a

01:04:53.400 --> 01:04:58.680
shortcut method which you may have seen before so I can just put v's here and then I know that

01:04:58.680 --> 01:05:03.080
whatever numbers go here they're going to have to multiply to the negative 10 and they're going to

01:05:03.080 --> 01:05:11.240
have to add to the 9. So that would be a plus 10 and a minus 1 will do the trick.

01:05:12.840 --> 01:05:17.480
Those are all my factoring examples for today. I hope you enjoy your snow morning and have a

01:05:17.480 --> 01:05:25.160
chance to spend some time working in Alex. Bye. This video is about working with rational

01:05:25.160 --> 01:05:30.760
expressions. A rational expression is a fraction usually with variables in it something like

01:05:30.760 --> 01:05:38.840
x plus 2 over x squared minus 3 is a rational expression. In this video we'll practice adding,

01:05:38.840 --> 01:05:45.640
subtracting, multiplying and dividing rational expressions and simplifying them to lowest terms.

01:05:48.200 --> 01:05:53.080
We'll start with simplifying to lowest terms. Recall that if you have a fraction with just

01:05:53.080 --> 01:06:00.520
numbers in it something like 21 over 45 we can reduce it to lowest terms by factoring the numerator

01:06:01.320 --> 01:06:04.280
and factoring the denominator

01:06:07.160 --> 01:06:17.320
and then canceling common factors. So in this example the 3's cancel and our fraction reduces

01:06:17.320 --> 01:06:25.240
to 7 over 15. If we want to reduce a rational expression with variables in it to lowest terms

01:06:25.320 --> 01:06:31.640
we proceed the same way. First we'll factor the numerator that's 3 times x plus 2

01:06:32.280 --> 01:06:39.880
and then factor the denominator. In this case it factors to x plus 2 times x plus 2 we could

01:06:39.880 --> 01:06:46.840
also write that as x plus 2 squared. Now we cancel the common factors and we're left with

01:06:46.840 --> 01:06:52.680
3 over x plus 2. Definitely a simpler way of writing that rational expression.

01:06:53.320 --> 01:07:01.080
Next let's practice multiplying and dividing. Recall that if we multiply two fractions with

01:07:01.080 --> 01:07:06.040
just numbers in them we simply multiply the numerators and multiply the denominators. So in

01:07:06.040 --> 01:07:15.800
this case we would get 4 times 2 over 3 times 5 or 8 fifteenths. If we want to divide two fractions

01:07:15.800 --> 01:07:23.000
like in the second example then we can rewrite it as multiplying by the reciprocal

01:07:23.560 --> 01:07:31.000
of the fraction on the denominator. So here we get 4 fifths times 3 halves and that gives us

01:07:32.200 --> 01:07:40.840
12 tenths but actually we could reduce that fraction to 6 fifths. We use the same rules when we

01:07:40.840 --> 01:07:46.760
compute the product or quotient of two rational expressions with the variables in them. Here

01:07:46.760 --> 01:07:55.160
we're trying to divide two rational expressions so instead we can multiply by the reciprocal.

01:07:55.160 --> 01:08:02.120
I call this flipping and multiplying and now we just multiply the numerators

01:08:03.800 --> 01:08:05.400
and multiply the denominators.

01:08:05.800 --> 01:08:15.800
It might be tempting at this point to multiply out to distribute out the numerator and the denominator

01:08:15.800 --> 01:08:20.760
but actually it's better to leave it in this factored form and factor it even more completely.

01:08:20.760 --> 01:08:26.840
That way we'll be able to reduce the rational expression to cancel the common factors. So let's

01:08:27.160 --> 01:08:35.800
the x squared plus x factors as x times x plus 1 and x squared minus 16 that's a difference of

01:08:35.800 --> 01:08:44.040
two squares that's x plus 4 times x minus 4. The denominator is already fully factored so we'll

01:08:44.040 --> 01:08:51.720
just copy it over and now we can cancel common factors here and here and we're left with x times

01:08:51.720 --> 01:09:00.360
x minus 4. This is our final answer. Adding and subtracting fractions is a little more complicated

01:09:00.360 --> 01:09:07.000
because we first have to find a common denominator. A common denominator is an expression that both

01:09:07.000 --> 01:09:13.800
denominators divide into. It's usually best of the long run to use the least common denominator

01:09:13.800 --> 01:09:20.200
which is the smallest expression that both denominators divide into. In this example

01:09:20.200 --> 01:09:27.560
if we just want a common denominator we could use 6 times 15 which is 90 because both 6 and 15

01:09:27.560 --> 01:09:33.720
divide evenly into 90 but if we want the least common denominator the best way to do that is to

01:09:33.720 --> 01:09:44.120
factor the two denominators so 6 is 2 times 3 15 is 3 times 5 and then put together only the factors

01:09:44.120 --> 01:09:53.800
we need for both 6 and 15 to divide our numbers so if we just use 2 times 3 times 5 which is 30

01:09:55.080 --> 01:10:01.560
we know that 2 times 3 will divide it and 3 times 5 will also divide it and we won't be able to get

01:10:01.560 --> 01:10:06.840
a denominator any smaller because we need the factors 2, 3, and 5 in order to ensure both

01:10:06.840 --> 01:10:12.920
these numbers divide it. Once we have our least common denominator we can rewrite each of our

01:10:12.920 --> 01:10:21.080
fractions in terms of that denominator. So 7, 6 I need to get a 30 in the denominator so I'm going

01:10:21.080 --> 01:10:29.240
to multiply that by 5 over 5. I multiply by the factors that are missing from the current

01:10:29.240 --> 01:10:34.520
denominator in order to get my least common denominator of 30. For the second fraction

01:10:35.160 --> 01:10:48.360
4 15, 15 times 2 is 30 so I'm going to multiply by 2 over 2. Now I can rewrite this as 35 30th

01:10:49.480 --> 01:10:56.360
minus 8 30th and now that I have a common denominator I can just subtract my two numerators

01:10:56.360 --> 01:11:10.520
and I get 27 30th. If I factor I can reduce this to 3 squared over 2 times 5 which is 9 tenths.

01:11:11.640 --> 01:11:16.600
The process for finding the sum of two rational expressions with variables in them

01:11:16.600 --> 01:11:22.280
follows the exact same process. First we have to find the least common denominator. I'll do that by

01:11:22.280 --> 01:11:30.040
factoring the two denominators. So 2x plus 2 factors as 2 times x plus 1, x squared minus 1

01:11:30.040 --> 01:11:36.120
that's a difference of 2 squared so that's x plus 1 times x minus 1. Now for the least common

01:11:36.120 --> 01:11:42.280
denominator I'm going to take all the factors I need to get an expression that each of these

01:11:42.280 --> 01:11:48.520
divides into. So I need the factor 2, I need the factor x plus 1, and I need the factor x minus 1.

01:11:48.520 --> 01:11:53.000
I don't have to repeat the factor x plus 1, I just need to have it one time

01:11:53.000 --> 01:11:59.880
and so I will get my least common denominator 2 times x plus 1 times x minus 1. I'm not going to

01:11:59.880 --> 01:12:04.440
bother multiplying this out, it's actually better to leave it in factored form to help me simplify

01:12:04.440 --> 01:12:12.840
later. Now I can rewrite each of my two rational expressions by multiplying by whatever's missing

01:12:12.840 --> 01:12:19.400
from the denominator in terms of the least common denominator. So what I mean is I can rewrite 3 over

01:12:19.400 --> 01:12:25.960
2x plus 2. I'll write the 2x plus 2 as 2 times x plus 1 already in factored form. And then I noticed

01:12:25.960 --> 01:12:31.800
that compared to the least common denominator I'm missing the factor of x minus 1. So I multiply

01:12:32.520 --> 01:12:38.280
the numerator and the denominator by x minus 1. I just need it in the denominator but I can't get

01:12:38.280 --> 01:12:42.680
away with just multiplying by the denominator without changing my expression. I have to multiply

01:12:42.680 --> 01:12:48.680
by it on the numerator and the denominator so I'm just multiplying by 1 in a fancy form and not

01:12:48.680 --> 01:12:53.720
changing the value here. So now I do the same thing for the second rational expression. I'll

01:12:53.720 --> 01:12:59.080
write the denominator in factored form to make it easier to see what's missing from the denominator.

01:12:59.080 --> 01:13:05.080
What's missing in this denominator compared to my least common denominator is just the factor 2.

01:13:05.160 --> 01:13:12.040
So I'll multiply the numerator and the denominator by 2. Now I can rewrite everything. So the first

01:13:12.040 --> 01:13:20.520
rational expression becomes 3 times x minus 1 over 2 times x plus 1 x minus 1 and the second one

01:13:20.520 --> 01:13:29.880
becomes 5 times 2 over 2 times x plus 1 x minus 1. Notice that I now have a common denominator

01:13:29.880 --> 01:13:37.560
so I can just add together my numerators. So I get 3 times x minus 1 plus 10 over 2

01:13:37.560 --> 01:13:44.360
times x plus 1 x minus 1. I'd like to simplify this and the best way to do that is to leave the

01:13:44.360 --> 01:13:50.600
denominator in factored form but I do have to multiply out the numerator so that I can add

01:13:50.600 --> 01:14:02.520
things together. So I get 3x minus 3 plus 10 over 2 times x plus 1 x minus 1 or 3x plus 7 over 2

01:14:02.520 --> 01:14:10.600
times x plus 1 x minus 1. Now 3x plus 7 doesn't factor and there's therefore no factors that I

01:14:10.600 --> 01:14:17.240
can cancel out. So this is already reduced as much as it can be. This is my final answer.

01:14:17.240 --> 01:14:25.960
In this video we saw how to simplify rational expressions to lowest terms by factoring and

01:14:25.960 --> 01:14:31.960
canceling common factors. We also saw how to multiply rational expressions by multiplying the

01:14:31.960 --> 01:14:37.080
numerator and multiplying the denominator, how to divide rational expressions by flipping and

01:14:37.080 --> 01:14:43.080
multiplying, and how to add and subtract rational expressions by writing them in terms of the least

01:14:43.160 --> 01:14:50.680
common denominator. This video is about solving quadratic equations. A quadratic equation is

01:14:50.680 --> 01:14:57.160
an equation that contains the square of the variable say x squared but no higher powers of x.

01:14:58.360 --> 01:15:06.120
The standard form for a quadratic equation is the form ax squared plus bx plus c equals zero

01:15:06.840 --> 01:15:16.040
where a, b, and c represent real numbers and a is not zero so that we actually have an x squared

01:15:16.040 --> 01:15:25.800
term. Let me give you an example. 3x squared plus 7x minus 2 equals zero is a quadratic equation in

01:15:25.800 --> 01:15:37.640
standard form. Here a is 3, b is 7, and c is minus 2. The equation 3x squared equals minus 7x plus 2

01:15:37.640 --> 01:15:43.640
is also a quadratic equation. It's just not in standard form. The key steps to solving quadratic

01:15:43.640 --> 01:15:51.000
equations are usually to write the equation in standard form and then either factor it

01:15:51.960 --> 01:15:56.360
or use the quadratic formula which I'll show you later in this video.

01:15:59.400 --> 01:16:06.680
Let's start with the example y squared equals 18 minus 7y. Here our variable is y and we need to

01:16:06.680 --> 01:16:13.640
rewrite this quadratic equation in standard form. We can do this by subtracting 18 from both sides

01:16:13.640 --> 01:16:22.920
and adding 7y to both sides. That gives us the equation y squared minus 18 plus 7y equals zero

01:16:22.920 --> 01:16:29.720
and I can rearrange a little bit to get y squared plus 7y minus 18 equals zero. Now I've got my

01:16:29.720 --> 01:16:37.320
equation in standard form. Next I'm going to try to factor it. So I need to look for two numbers

01:16:37.320 --> 01:16:45.640
that multiply to negative 18 and add to 7. Two numbers that work are 9 and negative 2,

01:16:45.640 --> 01:16:53.640
so I can factor my expression on the left as y plus 9 times y minus 2 equals zero.

01:16:54.680 --> 01:16:59.400
Now anytime you have two quantities that multiply together to give you zero,

01:17:00.120 --> 01:17:05.080
either the first quantity has to be zero or the second quantity has to be zero or I suppose they

01:17:05.080 --> 01:17:10.120
both could be zero in some situations. This is really handy because that means that I know

01:17:10.120 --> 01:17:18.440
that either y plus 9 equals zero or y minus 2 equals zero. So I can as my next step set my

01:17:18.440 --> 01:17:27.320
factors equal to zero. So y plus 9 equals zero or y minus 2 equals zero which means that y equals

01:17:27.320 --> 01:17:34.520
negative 9 or y equals 2. It's not a bad idea to check that those answers actually work by

01:17:34.600 --> 01:17:41.720
plugging them into the original equation negative 9 squared does that equal 18 minus 7 times negative

01:17:41.720 --> 01:17:49.000
9 and you can work out that it does and similarly 2 squared equals 18 minus 7 times 2.

01:17:50.920 --> 01:17:57.240
In the next example, let's find solutions of the equation w squared equals 121. This is a

01:17:57.240 --> 01:18:03.880
quadratic equation because it's got a square of my variable w. I can rewrite it in standard form

01:18:04.520 --> 01:18:13.720
by subtracting 121 from both sides. Notice that a is equal to one b is equal to zero because there's

01:18:13.720 --> 01:18:22.600
no w term and c is equal to negative 121 in the standard form a w squared plus b w plus c equals

01:18:22.600 --> 01:18:32.280
zero. Next step, I'm going to try to factor this expression. So since 121 is 11 squared,

01:18:32.280 --> 01:18:39.880
this is a difference of two squares and it factors as w plus 11 times w minus 11 is equal to zero.

01:18:40.600 --> 01:18:50.600
If I set the factors equal to zero, I get w plus 11 equals zero or w minus 11 equals zero. So w

01:18:50.600 --> 01:18:58.200
equals minus 11 or w equals 11. In this example, I could have solved the equation more simply. I

01:18:58.200 --> 01:19:05.640
could have instead said that if w squared is 121, then w has to equal plus or minus the square root

01:19:05.640 --> 01:19:13.080
of 121. In other words, w is plus or minus 11. If you solve the equation this way, it's important

01:19:13.080 --> 01:19:19.560
to remember the plus or minus since minus 11 squared equals 121 just like 11 squared does.

01:19:21.000 --> 01:19:27.320
Now let's find the solutions for the equation x times x plus 2 equals 7. Some people might be

01:19:27.320 --> 01:19:32.680
tempted to say that, oh, if two numbers multiply to equal seven, then one of them better equal one

01:19:32.680 --> 01:19:38.040
and the other equals seven or maybe negative one and negative seven. But that's faulty reasoning

01:19:38.040 --> 01:19:45.160
in this case, because x and x plus two don't have to be whole numbers. They could be crazy

01:19:45.160 --> 01:19:53.000
fractions or even irrational numbers. So instead, let's rewrite this equation in standard form.

01:19:53.720 --> 01:20:01.160
To do that, I'm first going to multiply out. So x times x is x squared, x times 2 is 2x,

01:20:01.160 --> 01:20:07.160
that equals seven, and I'll subtract the seven from both sides to get x squared plus 2x minus

01:20:07.160 --> 01:20:13.080
seven is zero. Now I'm looking to factor it, so I need two numbers that multiply to negative seven

01:20:13.080 --> 01:20:19.400
and add to two. So it's the only way to factor negative seven is as negative one times seven or

01:20:19.480 --> 01:20:24.840
seven times negative one. It's easy to see that there are no whole numbers that will

01:20:26.120 --> 01:20:31.560
work. So there's no way to factor this expression over the integers. Instead, let's use the quadratic

01:20:31.560 --> 01:20:40.760
equation. So we have our leading coefficient of x squared is one. So a is one, b is two, and c is

01:20:40.760 --> 01:20:46.600
minus seven. And we're going to plug that into the equation, quadratic equation, which goes x

01:20:47.400 --> 01:20:54.520
equals negative b plus or minus the square root of b squared minus 4ac all over 2a.

01:20:55.880 --> 01:21:00.280
Different people have different ways of remembering this formula. I'd like to remember it by seeing

01:21:00.280 --> 01:21:08.840
it. x equals negative b plus or minus the square root of b squared minus 4ac all over 2a. But you

01:21:08.840 --> 01:21:14.680
can use any new monarchy like. Anyway, plugging in here, we have x equals negative 2 plus or minus

01:21:14.760 --> 01:21:21.560
the square root of two squared minus four times one times negative seven. It's important to remember

01:21:21.560 --> 01:21:30.440
the negative seven there, all over two times one. Now two squared is four, and four times one times

01:21:30.440 --> 01:21:37.160
negative seven is negative 28. So this whole quantity under the square root sign becomes four

01:21:37.160 --> 01:21:44.440
minus negative 28 or 32. So I can rewrite this as x equals negative two plus or minus the square

01:21:44.440 --> 01:21:55.320
root of 32 all over two. Since 32 is 16 times two, and 16 is a perfect square, I can rewrite this as

01:21:55.320 --> 01:22:00.920
negative two plus or minus the square root of 16 times the square root of two over two, which is

01:22:01.000 --> 01:22:04.760
negative two plus or minus four times the square root of two over two.

01:22:06.680 --> 01:22:14.440
Next, I'm going to split up my fraction as negative two over two plus or minus four square

01:22:14.440 --> 01:22:20.760
root of two over two, and then simplify those fractions. This becomes negative one plus or

01:22:20.760 --> 01:22:28.120
minus two square root of two. So my answers are negative one plus two square root of two,

01:22:28.120 --> 01:22:33.240
and negative one minus two square root of two. And if I need a decimal answer for any reason,

01:22:33.240 --> 01:22:40.040
I could work those out on my calculator. As our final example, let's find all real solutions for

01:22:40.040 --> 01:22:47.400
the equation one half y squared equals one third y minus two. I'll start as usual by putting it in

01:22:47.400 --> 01:22:56.840
standard form. So that gives me one half y squared minus one third y plus two equals zero. I could

01:22:56.840 --> 01:23:02.280
go ahead and start trying to factor or use the quadratic formula right now. But I find fractional

01:23:02.280 --> 01:23:07.080
coefficients kind of annoying. So I'd like to get rid of them by doing what I call clearing the

01:23:07.080 --> 01:23:11.720
denominator. That means I'm going to multiply the whole entire equation by the least common

01:23:11.720 --> 01:23:17.080
denominator. In this case, the least common denominator is two times three or six. So I'll

01:23:17.080 --> 01:23:22.200
multiply the whole equation by six. I have to make sure I multiply both sides of the equation,

01:23:22.200 --> 01:23:28.360
but in this case, six times zero is just zero. And when I distribute the six, I get three y squared

01:23:28.360 --> 01:23:35.320
minus two y plus 12 equals zero. Now, I could try to factor this, but I think it's easier

01:23:35.320 --> 01:23:43.960
probably just to plunge in and use the quadratic formula. So I get x equals negative b, that's

01:23:43.960 --> 01:23:52.360
negative negative two or two plus or minus the square root of b squared minus four times a times

01:23:52.360 --> 01:24:02.040
c all over two a. Working out the stuff on the square root sign negative two squared is four.

01:24:02.040 --> 01:24:10.840
And here we have, let's see 144. So this simplifies to x equals two plus or minus the square root of

01:24:11.720 --> 01:24:19.320
four minus 144, that's negative 140 all over six. Well, if you're concerned about the

01:24:19.320 --> 01:24:24.360
negative number under the square root sign, you should be, we can't take the square root of a

01:24:24.360 --> 01:24:30.200
negative number and get and get a real number as our answer, there's no real number whose square is

01:24:30.200 --> 01:24:37.640
a negative number. And therefore, our conclusion is we have no real solutions to this quadratic

01:24:37.640 --> 01:24:44.600
equation. In this video, we solve some quadratic equations by first writing them in standard form

01:24:44.600 --> 01:24:50.680
and then either factoring or using the quadratic formula. In some examples, factoring doesn't

01:24:50.680 --> 01:24:56.040
work. It's not possible to factor the equation. But in fact, using the quadratic formula will

01:24:56.040 --> 01:25:02.600
always work, even if it's also possible to solve it by factoring. So you can't really lose by using

01:25:02.600 --> 01:25:09.000
the quadratic formula. It's just sometimes it'll be faster to factor instead. This video is about

01:25:09.000 --> 01:25:15.800
solving equations with absolute values in them. Recall that the absolute value of a positive

01:25:15.800 --> 01:25:22.760
number is just the number, but the absolute value of a negative number is its opposite. In general,

01:25:22.760 --> 01:25:27.960
I think of the absolute value of a number as representing its distance from zero on the number

01:25:27.960 --> 01:25:37.800
line. The number four and the number negative four are both at distance four from zero. And so the

01:25:37.800 --> 01:25:46.840
absolute value of both of them is four. Similarly, if I write the equation, the absolute value of x

01:25:46.840 --> 01:25:57.480
is three, that means that x has to be three units away from zero on the number line. And so x would

01:25:57.480 --> 01:26:03.800
have to be either negative three or three. Let's start with the equation three times the absolute

01:26:03.800 --> 01:26:12.200
value of x plus two equals four. I'd like to isolate the absolute value part of the equation.

01:26:13.160 --> 01:26:16.920
I can do this by starting with my original equation,

01:26:17.480 --> 01:26:25.800
subtracting two from both sides, and dividing both sides by three.

01:26:30.200 --> 01:26:37.480
Now I'll think in terms of distance. On a number line, the absolute value of x is two thirds,

01:26:37.480 --> 01:26:47.800
means that x is two thirds away from zero. So x could be here, or here, at negative two thirds,

01:26:47.800 --> 01:26:55.480
or at two thirds. And the answer to my equation is x is negative two thirds, or two thirds.

01:26:56.760 --> 01:27:04.280
I can check my answers by plugging in three times the absolute value of negative two thirds

01:27:04.280 --> 01:27:09.560
plus two. I need to check if that equals four. Well, the absolute value of negative two thirds

01:27:09.560 --> 01:27:15.640
is just two thirds. So this is three times two thirds plus two, which works out to four.

01:27:18.120 --> 01:27:25.480
Similarly, if I plug in positive two thirds, it also works out to give me a correct answer.

01:27:26.360 --> 01:27:30.600
This second example is a little different, because the absolute value sign is around

01:27:30.600 --> 01:27:39.160
a more complicated expression, not just around the x. I would start by isolating the absolute value part,

01:27:42.120 --> 01:27:48.120
but it's already isolated. So I'll just go ahead and jump to thinking about distance

01:27:48.120 --> 01:27:55.160
on the number line. So on my number line, the whole expression three x plus two

01:27:55.800 --> 01:28:05.000
is supposed to be at a distance of four from zero. So that means that three x plus two is here at four,

01:28:05.000 --> 01:28:14.040
or three x plus two is at negative four. I'll write those as equations. Three x plus two equals four,

01:28:14.040 --> 01:28:21.880
or three x plus two is minus four, and then I can solve. So this becomes three x equals two,

01:28:21.960 --> 01:28:30.200
or x equals two thirds. And over here, I get three x equals minus six, or x equals minus two.

01:28:31.480 --> 01:28:38.280
Finally, I'll check my answers. I'll leave it to you to verify that they both work.

01:28:39.720 --> 01:28:44.920
A common mistake on absolute value equations is to get rid of the absolute value signs,

01:28:44.920 --> 01:28:50.680
like we did here, and then just solve for one answer instead of solving for both answers.

01:28:51.480 --> 01:28:55.560
Another mistake sometimes people make is once they get the first answer, they just assume

01:28:55.560 --> 01:29:02.680
that the negative of that works also. But that doesn't always work. In the first example,

01:29:02.680 --> 01:29:06.600
our two answers were both the negatives of each other. But in our second examples,

01:29:06.600 --> 01:29:11.560
our two answers were not just the opposites of each other. One was two thirds, and the other was

01:29:11.560 --> 01:29:18.440
negative two. In this third example, let's again isolate the absolute value part of the equation.

01:29:18.520 --> 01:29:27.240
So starting with our original equation, we can subtract 16 from both sides,

01:29:28.760 --> 01:29:32.760
and divide both sides by five, or equivalently multiply by one fifth.

01:29:37.560 --> 01:29:44.040
Now let's think about distance on the number line. We have an absolute value needs to equal

01:29:44.040 --> 01:29:50.920
negative three. So that means whatever is inside the absolute value sign needs to be at distance

01:29:50.920 --> 01:29:56.920
negative three from zero. Well, you can't be at distance negative three from zero.

01:29:57.480 --> 01:30:01.320
Another way of thinking about this is you can't have the absolute value of something and end up

01:30:01.320 --> 01:30:07.480
with a negative number. Absolute value is always positive or zero. So this equation doesn't actually

01:30:07.480 --> 01:30:17.560
make sense. And there are no solutions to this equation. In this video, we solved absolute

01:30:17.560 --> 01:30:24.680
value equations. In many cases, an absolute value equation will have two solutions. But in some cases,

01:30:24.680 --> 01:30:32.440
it'll have no solutions. And occasionally, it'll have just one solution. This video is about solving

01:30:32.440 --> 01:30:39.240
rational equations. A rational equation like this one is an equation that has rational expressions

01:30:39.240 --> 01:30:43.080
in it. In other words, an equation that has some variables in the denominator.

01:30:45.000 --> 01:30:49.640
There are several different approaches for solving a rational equation, but they all start

01:30:49.640 --> 01:30:56.200
by finding the least common denominator. In this example, the denominators are x plus three and x,

01:30:56.200 --> 01:31:02.280
we can think of one as just having a denominator of one. Since the denominators don't have any

01:31:02.280 --> 01:31:07.000
factors in common, I can find the least common denominator just by multiplying them together.

01:31:08.520 --> 01:31:15.320
My next step is going to be clearing the denominator. By this, I mean that I multiply

01:31:15.320 --> 01:31:23.400
both sides of my equation by this least common denominator, x plus three times x. I multiply

01:31:23.400 --> 01:31:30.200
on the left side of the equation. And I multiply by the same thing on the right side of the equation.

01:31:30.200 --> 01:31:36.360
Since I'm doing the same thing, the both sides of the equation, I don't change the value of the

01:31:36.360 --> 01:31:42.040
equation. Multiplying the least common denominator on both sides of the equation is equivalent to

01:31:42.040 --> 01:31:47.800
multiplying it by all three terms in the equation. I can see this when I multiply out.

01:31:49.080 --> 01:31:56.280
I'll rewrite the left side the same as before pretty much. And then I'll distribute the right

01:31:56.280 --> 01:32:04.440
side to get x plus three times x times one plus x plus three times x times one over x.

01:32:04.440 --> 01:32:10.280
So I've actually multiplied the least common denominator by all three terms of my equation.

01:32:10.280 --> 01:32:16.040
Now I can have a blast canceling things. The x plus three cancels with the x plus three on the

01:32:16.040 --> 01:32:23.320
denominator. The here are nothing cancels out because there's no denominator. And here the x

01:32:23.320 --> 01:32:28.440
in the numerator cancels with the x in the denominator. So I can rewrite my expression as

01:32:28.440 --> 01:32:36.920
x squared equals x plus three times x times one plus x plus three. Now I'm going to simplify.

01:32:38.440 --> 01:32:45.400
So I'll leave the x squared alone on this side, I'll distribute out x squared plus three x plus

01:32:45.400 --> 01:32:53.720
x plus three. Hey look the x squareds cancel on both sides. And so I get zero equals four x plus

01:32:53.720 --> 01:33:01.400
three. So four x is negative three and x is negative three fourths. Finally I'm going to plug in my

01:33:01.400 --> 01:33:06.840
answer to check. This is a good idea for any kind of equation. But it's especially important for a

01:33:06.840 --> 01:33:11.320
rational equation because occasionally for rational equations you'll get what's called extraneous

01:33:11.320 --> 01:33:15.400
solutions. Solutions that don't actually work in your original equation because they make the

01:33:15.400 --> 01:33:20.440
denominator zero. Now in this example I don't think we're going to get any extraneous equations

01:33:20.440 --> 01:33:26.360
because negative three fourths is not going to make any of these denominators zero. So it should

01:33:26.360 --> 01:33:38.680
work out fine when I plug in. If I plug in I get this. I can simplify the denominator here negative

01:33:38.680 --> 01:33:45.480
three fourths plus three. Three is twelve fourths. That becomes nine fourths. And this is one I'll flip

01:33:45.480 --> 01:33:55.160
and multiply to get minus four thirds. So here I can simplify my complex fraction. It ends up being

01:33:55.160 --> 01:34:01.720
negative three ninths and one minus four thirds is negative one third. So that all seems to check out.

01:34:01.720 --> 01:34:10.680
And so my final answer is x equals negative three fourths. This next example looks a little trickier

01:34:10.680 --> 01:34:17.720
and it is. But the same approach will work. First I'll find the least common denominator. So here my

01:34:17.720 --> 01:34:27.880
denominators are c minus five, c plus one, and c squared minus four c minus five. I'm going to

01:34:27.880 --> 01:34:35.480
factor that as c minus five times c plus one. Now my least common denominator needs to have

01:34:35.480 --> 01:34:41.720
just enough factors to that each of these denominators divide into it. So I need the factor

01:34:41.720 --> 01:34:47.560
c minus five. I need the factor c plus one. And now I've already got all the factors I need for

01:34:47.560 --> 01:34:54.840
this denominator. So here is my least common denominator. Next step is to clear the denominators.

01:34:54.840 --> 01:35:02.120
So I do this by multiplying both sides of the equation by my least common denominator. In fact,

01:35:02.120 --> 01:35:06.680
I can just multiply each of the three terms by this least common denominator.

01:35:09.400 --> 01:35:14.760
I went ahead and wrote my third denominator in factored form to make it easier to see what

01:35:14.760 --> 01:35:24.760
cancels. Now canceling time not dies. This dies and both of those factors die. Canceling out the

01:35:24.760 --> 01:35:30.040
denominators the whole point of multiplying by the least common denominator. You're multiplying by

01:35:30.040 --> 01:35:33.960
something that's big enough to kill every single denominator. So you don't have to deal with

01:35:33.960 --> 01:35:44.680
denominators anymore. Now I'm going to simplify by multiplying out. So I get let's see c plus one

01:35:44.680 --> 01:35:54.760
times four c that's four c squared plus four c. Now I get minus just c minus five. And then over

01:35:54.760 --> 01:36:06.040
here I get three c squared plus three. I can rewrite the minus quantity c minus five as minus c plus

01:36:06.040 --> 01:36:15.160
five. And now I can subtract the three c squared from both sides to get just a c squared over here.

01:36:16.200 --> 01:36:25.960
And the four c minus c that becomes three c. And finally I can subtract the three from both

01:36:25.960 --> 01:36:34.200
sides to get c squared plus three c plus two equals zero. I've got myself a quadratic equation

01:36:34.200 --> 01:36:41.480
that looks like a nice one that factors. So this factors to c plus one times c plus two equals zero.

01:36:42.040 --> 01:36:49.800
So either c plus one is zero or c plus two is zero. So c equals negative one or c equals negative two.

01:36:52.120 --> 01:36:59.480
Now let's see we need to still check our answers. Without even going to the trouble of

01:36:59.480 --> 01:37:05.480
calculating anything, I can see that c equals negative one is not going to work. Because if I plug

01:37:05.480 --> 01:37:13.240
it in to this denominator here, I get a denominator zero, which doesn't make sense. So c equals minus

01:37:13.240 --> 01:37:22.040
one is an extraneous solution. It doesn't actually satisfy my original equation. And so I can just

01:37:22.120 --> 01:37:29.880
cross it right out. c equals negative two. I can go if I go ahead and that doesn't make any of my

01:37:29.880 --> 01:37:35.480
denominator zero. So if I haven't made any mistakes, it should satisfy my original equation. But

01:37:36.440 --> 01:37:45.880
I'll just plug it in to be sure. And after some simplifying, I get a true statement.

01:37:46.440 --> 01:37:53.320
So my final answer is c equals negative two. In this video, we solved a couple of rational

01:37:53.320 --> 01:38:00.920
equations using the method of finding the least common denominator and then clearing the denominator.

01:38:02.200 --> 01:38:06.840
We cleared the denominator by multiplying both sides of the equation by the least common denominator

01:38:06.840 --> 01:38:13.080
or equivalently multiplying each of the terms by that denominator. There's another equivalent

01:38:13.160 --> 01:38:19.160
method that some people prefer. It still starts out the same, we find the least common denominator,

01:38:19.160 --> 01:38:27.480
but then we write all the fractions over that least common denominator. So in this example,

01:38:27.480 --> 01:38:33.720
we'd still use the least common denominator of x plus three times x. But our next step would be to

01:38:33.720 --> 01:38:38.680
write each of these rational expressions over that common denominator by multiplying the top and

01:38:39.640 --> 01:38:45.960
the bottom by the appropriate things. So one, in order to get the common denominator of x plus

01:38:45.960 --> 01:38:51.880
three x, I need to multiply the top and the bottom by x plus three times x, one over x, I need to

01:38:51.880 --> 01:38:57.640
multiply the top and the bottom just by x plus three, since that's what's missing from the denominator

01:38:57.640 --> 01:39:08.360
x. Now if I simplify a little bit, let's see, this is x squared over that common denominator. And

01:39:10.840 --> 01:39:17.560
here I have just x plus three times x over that denominator. And here I have x plus three over

01:39:17.560 --> 01:39:24.760
that common denominator. Now add together my fractions on the right side. So they have a

01:39:24.760 --> 01:39:33.640
common denominator. So this is x plus three times x plus x plus three. And now I have two

01:39:33.640 --> 01:39:39.560
fractions that have that are equal that have the same denominator, therefore their numerators have

01:39:39.560 --> 01:39:50.280
to be equal also. So the next step is to set the numerators equal. So I get x squared is x plus three

01:39:50.280 --> 01:39:57.240
times x plus x plus three. And if you look back at the previous way we solved this equation,

01:39:57.240 --> 01:40:02.280
you'll recognize this equation. And so from here on, we just continue as before.

01:40:05.560 --> 01:40:09.400
When choosing between these two methods, I personally tend to prefer the clear the denominators

01:40:09.400 --> 01:40:13.320
method because it's a little bit less writing, you don't have to, you get rid of those denominators

01:40:13.320 --> 01:40:17.720
earlier, you don't have to write them as many times. But some people find this one a little bit

01:40:17.720 --> 01:40:21.560
easier to remember a little easier to understand either of these methods is fine.

01:40:23.080 --> 01:40:30.360
One last caution, don't forget at the end to check your solutions and eliminate any extraneous

01:40:30.360 --> 01:40:37.480
solutions. These will be solutions that make the denominators of your original equations go to zero.

01:40:38.520 --> 01:40:44.600
This video is about solving radical equations. That is equations like this one that have square

01:40:44.600 --> 01:40:51.080
root signs in them, or cube roots or any other kind of radical. When I see an equation with a

01:40:51.080 --> 01:40:55.960
square root in it, I really want to get rid of the square root. But it'll be easiest to get rid

01:40:55.960 --> 01:41:02.360
of the square root. If I first isolate the square root. In other words, I want to get the term with

01:41:02.360 --> 01:41:07.800
the square root in it on one side of the equation by itself, and everything else on the other side

01:41:07.800 --> 01:41:13.640
of the equation. If I start with my original equation x plus the square root of x equals 12,

01:41:14.280 --> 01:41:20.680
and I subtract x from both sides, then that does isolate the square root term on the left side

01:41:20.680 --> 01:41:26.760
with everything else on the right. Once I've isolated the term with the square root, I'm going

01:41:26.760 --> 01:41:37.000
to get rid of the square root. And I'll do that by squaring both sides of my equation. So I'll

01:41:37.000 --> 01:41:46.600
take the square root of x equals 12 minus x and square both sides. Now the square root of x squared

01:41:46.600 --> 01:41:51.720
is just x, taking the square root and then squaring those operations undo each other.

01:41:53.160 --> 01:42:00.680
To work out 12 minus x squared, I'll write it out and distribute 12 times 12 is 144.

01:42:01.480 --> 01:42:08.680
12 times minus x is minus 12 x. I get another minus 12 x from here.

01:42:10.280 --> 01:42:18.200
And finally minus x times minus x is positive x squared. So I can combine my minus 12 x, so that's

01:42:18.200 --> 01:42:28.200
minus 24 x. And now I can subtract x from both sides to get zero equals 144 minus 25 x plus x

01:42:28.200 --> 01:42:35.160
squared. That's a quadratic equation. I'll rewrite it in a little bit more standard form here.

01:42:36.840 --> 01:42:42.040
So now I've got a familiar quadratic equation with no radical signs left in my equation.

01:42:42.040 --> 01:42:47.400
I'll just proceed to solve it like I usually do for a quadratic. I'll try to factor it. So I'm going

01:42:47.400 --> 01:42:54.600
to look for two numbers that multiply to 144 and add to minus 25. Well, I know I'm going to need

01:42:54.840 --> 01:43:01.800
negative numbers to get to negative 25. And in fact, I'll need two negative numbers. So they

01:43:01.800 --> 01:43:08.200
still multiply to a positive number. So I'll start listing some factors of 144. I could have negative

01:43:08.200 --> 01:43:17.480
one and a negative 144, negative two, and negative 72, negative four, negative 36, and so on.

01:43:18.360 --> 01:43:21.240
Once I've listed out the possible factors, it's not hard to find

01:43:22.040 --> 01:43:29.480
the two that add to negative 25. So that's negative nine and negative 16. So now I can factor my

01:43:29.480 --> 01:43:37.800
quadratic equation as x minus nine times x minus 16 equals zero. That means that x minus nine is zero

01:43:37.800 --> 01:43:46.040
or x minus 16 is zero. So x equals nine or x equals 16. I'm almost done. But there's one last

01:43:46.040 --> 01:43:53.400
very important step. And that's to check the solutions so that we can eliminate any extraneous

01:43:53.400 --> 01:43:59.720
solutions. An extraneous solution is a solution that we get that does not actually satisfy

01:43:59.720 --> 01:44:05.160
our original equation. And extraneous solutions can happen when you're solving equations with

01:44:05.160 --> 01:44:11.400
radicals in them. So let's first check x equals nine. If we plug in to our original equation,

01:44:11.400 --> 01:44:16.360
we get nine plus the square root of nine and we want that to equal 12. Well, the square root of

01:44:16.360 --> 01:44:23.400
nine is three, and nine plus three does indeed equal 12. So that solution checks out. Now let's

01:44:23.400 --> 01:44:29.560
try x equals 16. Plugging in, we get 16 plus the square root of 16. And that's supposed to equal

01:44:29.560 --> 01:44:36.840
12. Well, that says 16 plus four is supposed to equal 12. But that most definitely is not true.

01:44:36.840 --> 01:44:45.400
And so x equals 16 turns out to be extraneous solution. And our only solution is x equals nine.

01:45:07.240 --> 01:45:34.440
This next equation might not look like an equation involving radicals. But in fact, we can think

01:45:34.520 --> 01:45:40.520
of a fractional exponent as being a radical in disguise. Let's start by doing the same thing

01:45:40.520 --> 01:45:47.560
we did on the previous problem by isolating. This time, we'll isolate the part of the equation

01:45:49.320 --> 01:45:54.280
that involves the fractional exponent. So I'll start with the original equation,

01:45:54.280 --> 01:45:59.960
two times p to the fourth fifths equals one eighth, and I'll divide both sides by two,

01:45:59.960 --> 01:46:07.080
or equivalently, I can multiply both sides by one half. That gives me p to the fourth fifths

01:46:07.080 --> 01:46:12.760
equals one sixteenth. And I've effectively isolated the part of the equation with the

01:46:12.760 --> 01:46:20.520
fractional exponent as much as possible. Now, in the previous example, the next step was to get rid

01:46:20.520 --> 01:46:26.920
of the radical. In this example, we're going to get rid of the fractional exponent. And I'm going

01:46:26.920 --> 01:46:33.320
to actually do this in two stages. First, I'm going to raise both sides to the fifth power.

01:46:35.720 --> 01:46:41.480
That's because when I take an exponent to an exponent, I multiply my exponents,

01:46:42.120 --> 01:46:48.120
and so that becomes just p to the fourth equals one sixteenth to the fifth power.

01:46:48.920 --> 01:46:55.080
Now I'm going to get rid of the fourth power by raising both sides to the one fourth power

01:46:55.080 --> 01:47:00.840
or by taking the fourth root. There's something that you need to be careful about, though, when

01:47:00.840 --> 01:47:08.600
taking an even root, or the one over an even number power, you always have to consider

01:47:09.240 --> 01:47:17.960
plus or minus your answer. It's kind of like when you write x squared equals four, and you

01:47:17.960 --> 01:47:23.720
take the square root of both sides, x could equal plus or minus the square root of four, right,

01:47:23.720 --> 01:47:30.440
x could equal plus or minus two, since minus two squared is for just as well as two squared.

01:47:31.080 --> 01:47:39.800
So that's why when you take an even root, or a one over an even power of both sides,

01:47:39.800 --> 01:47:47.160
you always need to include the plus or minus sign. When it's an odd root or one over an odd power,

01:47:47.160 --> 01:47:54.520
you don't need to do that. If you had something like x cubed equals negative eight, then x equals

01:47:54.520 --> 01:47:59.320
the cube root of negative eight, which is negative two would be your only solution. You don't need

01:47:59.320 --> 01:48:06.040
to do the plus or minus because positive two wouldn't work. So that aside explains why we need this

01:48:06.040 --> 01:48:13.320
plus or minus power. And now p to the four to the one fourth, when I raise a power to a power,

01:48:13.400 --> 01:48:19.800
I multiply by exponents. So that's just p to the one, which is equal to plus or minus

01:48:19.800 --> 01:48:27.560
one sixteenth to the fifth power to the one fourth power. Now I just need to simplify this

01:48:27.560 --> 01:48:33.480
expression. I don't really want to raise one sixteenth to the fifth power, because 16 to the

01:48:33.480 --> 01:48:38.760
fifth power is like a really huge number. So I think I'm actually going to rewrite this first

01:48:39.560 --> 01:48:49.080
as p equals plus or minus one sixteenth, I'll write it back as the five fourth power again.

01:48:50.200 --> 01:48:54.840
And as I continue to solve using my exponent rules,

01:48:57.080 --> 01:49:06.040
I'm going to prefer to write this as one sixteenth to the fourth root to the fifth power,

01:49:06.040 --> 01:49:10.920
because it's going to be easier to take the fourth root. Let's see the fourth root of one

01:49:10.920 --> 01:49:15.240
sixteenth is the same thing as the fourth root of one over the fourth root of 16,

01:49:15.240 --> 01:49:21.080
raise all that to the fifth power, fourth root of one is just one, and the fourth root of 16 is two,

01:49:21.800 --> 01:49:26.840
raise that to the fifth power. That's just going to be one to the fifth over two to the fifth,

01:49:26.920 --> 01:49:29.720
which is plus or minus one 30 seconds.

01:49:32.600 --> 01:49:40.600
The last step is to check answers. So I have the two answers p equals one 30 second and p

01:49:40.600 --> 01:49:48.680
equals minus one 30 seconds. And if I plug those both in one 30 second to the fourth fifth power,

01:49:48.680 --> 01:49:57.800
that gives me two times one to the fourth fifth power over 32 to the fourth fifth power,

01:49:58.440 --> 01:50:07.320
which is two times one over 32 fifth rooted to the fourth power, fifth root of 32 is two,

01:50:07.960 --> 01:50:14.520
raise that to the fourth power, I get 16. So this is two times one sixteenth, which is one eighth,

01:50:14.520 --> 01:50:23.480
just as we wanted in the original equation up here. Similarly, we can check that the p equals

01:50:23.480 --> 01:50:28.520
negative one 30 second actually does satisfy the equation. I'll leave that step to the viewer.

01:50:31.800 --> 01:50:37.400
So our two solutions are p equals one over 32 and p equals minus one over 32.

01:50:38.120 --> 01:50:42.200
I do want to point out an alternate approach to getting rid of the fractional exponent.

01:50:42.760 --> 01:50:48.760
We could have gotten rid of it all in one fell swoop by raising both sides of our equation

01:50:48.760 --> 01:50:56.520
to the five fourths power. Five fourths is the reciprocal of four fifths. So when I use my

01:50:56.520 --> 01:51:02.680
exponent rules, and say that when I raise the power to the power, I multiply my exponents,

01:51:02.680 --> 01:51:09.240
that gives me p to the four fifths times five fourths is plus or minus one sixteenth to the

01:51:09.240 --> 01:51:16.680
five fourths. In other words, p to the one power, which is just p is plus or minus one sixteenth

01:51:16.680 --> 01:51:22.520
to the five fourths. So that's an alternate and possibly faster way to get to the solution.

01:51:22.520 --> 01:51:27.640
Once again, the plus or minus comes from the fact that when we take the five fourth power,

01:51:27.640 --> 01:51:33.560
we're really taking an even root of fourth root. And so we need to consider both positive and

01:51:33.560 --> 01:51:40.280
negative answers. This video is about solving radical equations, that is equations like this one

01:51:41.000 --> 01:51:45.320
that have square root signs in them, or cube roots or any other kind of radical.

01:51:46.840 --> 01:51:54.120
In this video, we solved radical equations by first isolating the radical sign or the fractional

01:51:54.120 --> 01:52:03.880
exponent, and then removing the radical sign or the fractional exponent by either squaring

01:52:03.880 --> 01:52:12.200
both sides or taking the reciprocal power of both sides. This video is about solving inequalities

01:52:12.200 --> 01:52:17.960
that have absolute value signs in them. Let's look at the inequality absolute value of x is

01:52:17.960 --> 01:52:23.560
less than five on the number line. Thinking of absolute value as distance, this means that the

01:52:23.560 --> 01:52:31.080
distance between x and zero is less than five units. So x has to live somewhere in between

01:52:31.080 --> 01:52:38.840
negative five and five. We can express this as an inequality without absolute value signs

01:52:38.840 --> 01:52:45.880
by saying negative five is less than x, which is less than five, or we can use interval notation,

01:52:45.880 --> 01:52:52.920
soft bracket, negative five, five, soft bracket. Both of these formulations are equivalent to

01:52:52.920 --> 01:52:59.320
the original one, but don't involve the absolute value signs. In the second example, we're looking

01:52:59.320 --> 01:53:04.920
for the values of x for which the absolute value of x is greater than or equal to five.

01:53:06.360 --> 01:53:12.920
On the number line, this means that the distance of x from the zero is got to be

01:53:12.920 --> 01:53:19.560
bigger than or equal to five units. A distance bigger than five units means that x has to live

01:53:19.560 --> 01:53:25.880
somewhere over here, or somewhere over here, where it's farther than five units away from zero.

01:53:26.760 --> 01:53:32.600
Of course, x could also have a distance equal to five units. So I'll fill in that dot and

01:53:32.600 --> 01:53:39.560
shade in the other parts of the number line that satisfy my inequality. Now I can rewrite the

01:53:39.560 --> 01:53:45.880
inequality without the absolute value symbols by saying that x is less than or equal to negative

01:53:45.880 --> 01:53:52.680
five, or x is greater than or equal to five. I could also write this in interval notation,

01:53:54.040 --> 01:54:01.480
soft bracket, negative infinity, negative five, hard bracket. And the second part is hard bracket,

01:54:01.480 --> 01:54:08.680
five, infinity, soft bracket. I combine these with a U for union, because I'm trying to describe

01:54:08.680 --> 01:54:14.760
all these points on the number line together with all these other points. Let's take this analysis

01:54:14.760 --> 01:54:19.960
a step further with a slightly more complicated problem. Now I want the absolute value of three

01:54:19.960 --> 01:54:28.040
minus two t to be less than four. An absolute value less than four means a distance less than four on

01:54:28.040 --> 01:54:34.200
the number line. But it's not the variable t that lives in here at a distance of less than four from

01:54:34.200 --> 01:54:44.920
zero. It's the whole expression three minus two t. So three minus two t lives somewhere in here. And

01:54:44.920 --> 01:54:52.920
I can rewrite this as an inequality without absolute value signs by saying negative four is less than

01:54:52.920 --> 01:54:59.880
three minus two t is less than four. Now I have a compound inequality that I can solve the usual

01:54:59.880 --> 01:55:06.360
way. First, I'll subtract three from all three sides to get negative seven is less than negative

01:55:06.360 --> 01:55:13.960
two t is less than one. And now I'll divide all three sides by negative two. Since negative two

01:55:13.960 --> 01:55:22.600
is a negative number, this reverses the directions of the inequalities. Simplifying I get seven halves

01:55:22.600 --> 01:55:29.080
is greater than t is greater than negative one half. So my final answer on the number line

01:55:29.080 --> 01:55:33.640
looks like all the stuff between negative a half and seven halves,

01:55:35.560 --> 01:55:41.240
but not including the endpoints and an interval notation I can write this soft bracket negative

01:55:41.240 --> 01:55:46.920
a half seven halves soft bracket. Please pause the video and try the next problem on your own.

01:55:48.120 --> 01:55:53.800
Thinking in terms of distance, this inequality says that the distance between the expression

01:55:53.800 --> 01:56:00.120
three minus two t and zero is always bigger than four. Let me draw this on the number line.

01:56:01.400 --> 01:56:08.440
If three minus two t has a distance bigger than four from zero, then it can't be in this region

01:56:08.440 --> 01:56:13.160
that's near zero, it has to be on the outside in one of these two regions.

01:56:14.840 --> 01:56:22.840
That is, three minus two t is either less than negative four, or three minus two t is bigger than

01:56:22.840 --> 01:56:28.920
four. I'll solve these two inequalities separately. The first one subtracting three from both sides,

01:56:28.920 --> 01:56:36.680
I get negative two t is less than negative seven, dividing by negative two, I get t is

01:56:36.680 --> 01:56:43.720
bigger than seven halves. And then on the other side, I get negative two t is greater than one.

01:56:43.720 --> 01:56:50.840
So t is less than negative one half. I had to flip inequalities in the last step

01:56:50.920 --> 01:56:55.720
due to dividing by a negative number. So let's check this out on the number line again.

01:56:56.360 --> 01:57:03.400
The first piece says that t is greater than seven halves. I'll draw that over here.

01:57:05.000 --> 01:57:11.640
And the second piece says that t is less than negative one half. I'll draw that down here.

01:57:14.600 --> 01:57:19.800
Because these two statements are joined with an or, I'm looking for the t values

01:57:19.800 --> 01:57:25.400
that are in this one, or in this one. That is, I want both of these regions put together.

01:57:26.120 --> 01:57:32.680
So an interval notation, this reads negative infinity to negative one half soft bracket union

01:57:33.240 --> 01:57:39.640
soft bracket seven halves to infinity. This last example looks more complicated.

01:57:39.640 --> 01:57:45.400
But if I simplify first and isolate the absolute value part, it looks pretty much like the previous

01:57:45.400 --> 01:57:52.200
ones. So I'll start by subtracting seven from both sides. And then I'll divide both sides by two.

01:57:53.000 --> 01:58:00.840
Now I'll draw my number line. And I'm looking for this expression for x plus five to always have

01:58:00.840 --> 01:58:07.000
distance greater than or equal to negative three from zero. Wait a second distance greater than

01:58:07.000 --> 01:58:10.600
equal to negative three. Well distance is always greater than or equal to negative three, it's

01:58:10.600 --> 01:58:19.160
always greater than or equal to zero. So this in fact is always true. And so the answer to my

01:58:19.160 --> 01:58:27.240
inequality is all numbers between negative infinity and infinity. In other words, all real numbers.

01:58:29.560 --> 01:58:33.160
When solving absolute value inequalities, it's good to think about distance.

01:58:34.120 --> 01:58:42.040
An absolute value of something that's less than a number means that whatever's inside the absolute

01:58:42.040 --> 01:58:50.600
value signs is close to zero. On the other hand, an absolute value of something being greater than

01:58:50.600 --> 01:58:57.000
a number means that whatever's inside the absolute value sign is far away from zero.

01:58:57.000 --> 01:59:04.760
Because its distance from zero is bigger than a certain number. Drawing these pictures on the

01:59:04.760 --> 01:59:11.160
number line is a helpful way to rewrite the absolute value inequality as an inequality that

01:59:11.160 --> 01:59:17.400
doesn't contain an absolute value sign. In this case, it would be negative three is less than x

01:59:17.400 --> 01:59:24.920
plus two is less than three. And the other case, it would be either x plus two is less than negative

01:59:24.920 --> 01:59:32.840
three or x plus two is greater than three. This video is about solving linear inequalities.

01:59:32.840 --> 01:59:39.800
Those are inequalities like this one that involve a variable here x, but don't involve any x squared

01:59:39.800 --> 01:59:46.360
or other higher power terms. The good news is, we can solve linear inequalities just like we'd

01:59:46.360 --> 01:59:52.520
solve linear equations by distributing, adding and subtracting terms to both sides and multiplying

01:59:52.520 --> 01:59:57.960
and dividing by numbers on both sides. The only thing that's different is that if you

01:59:58.600 --> 02:00:04.920
multiply or divide by a negative number, then you need to reverse the direction of the inequality.

02:00:05.800 --> 02:00:11.800
For example, if we had the inequality negative x is less than negative five, and we wanted to

02:00:11.800 --> 02:00:19.000
multiply both sides by negative one to get rid of the negative signs, we'd have to also switch

02:00:19.000 --> 02:00:24.120
or reverse the inequality. With this caution in mind, let's look at our first example.

02:00:25.400 --> 02:00:30.360
Since our variable x is trapped in parentheses, I'll distribute the negative five to free it from

02:00:30.360 --> 02:00:36.600
the parentheses. That gives me negative five x minus 10 plus three is greater than eight.

02:00:38.360 --> 02:00:44.360
Negative 10 plus three is negative seven. So I'll rewrite this as negative five x minus seven is

02:00:44.360 --> 02:00:51.880
greater than eight. Now I'll add seven to both sides to get negative five x is greater than 15.

02:00:52.840 --> 02:00:58.520
Now I'd like to divide both sides by negative five, since negative five is a negative number

02:00:58.520 --> 02:01:06.280
that reverses the inequality. So I get x is less than 15 divided by negative five. In other words,

02:01:06.280 --> 02:01:13.320
x is less than negative three. If I wanted to graph this on a number line, I just need to put down

02:01:13.320 --> 02:01:20.760
a negative three, an open circle around it, and shade into the left. I use an open circle

02:01:20.760 --> 02:01:26.280
because x is strictly less than negative three and can't equal negative three. If I wanted to

02:01:26.280 --> 02:01:31.640
write this in interval notation, I've read it as soft bracket, negative infinity, negative three,

02:01:31.640 --> 02:01:36.760
soft bracket. Again, the soft bracket is because the negative three is not included.

02:01:37.720 --> 02:01:45.240
This next example is an example of a compound inequality. It has two parts. Either this statement

02:01:45.240 --> 02:01:50.920
is true or this statement is true. I want to find the values of x that satisfy either one.

02:01:51.880 --> 02:01:56.600
I'll solve this by working out each part separately and then combining them at the end.

02:01:57.480 --> 02:02:03.720
For the inequality on the left, I'll copy it over here. I'm going to add four to both sides,

02:02:04.680 --> 02:02:11.640
then subtract x from both sides, and then divide both sides by two.

02:02:13.960 --> 02:02:17.640
I didn't have to reverse the inequality sign because I divided by a positive number.

02:02:18.840 --> 02:02:25.720
On the right side, I'll copy the equation over, subtract one from both sides, and divide both

02:02:25.720 --> 02:02:33.160
sides by six. Nine, six is the same as three halves. Now I'm looking for the x values that make

02:02:33.160 --> 02:02:38.840
this statement true or make this statement true. Let me graph this on a number line.

02:02:41.000 --> 02:02:48.280
x is less than or equal to negative two means I put a filled in circle there and graph everything

02:02:48.280 --> 02:02:57.080
to the left. x is greater than three halves means I put an empty circle here and shade in everything

02:02:57.080 --> 02:03:06.600
to the right. My final answer includes both of these pieces, which I'll reshade in green because

02:03:06.600 --> 02:03:11.960
x is allowed to be in either one or the other. Finally, I can write this in interval notation.

02:03:12.680 --> 02:03:17.560
The first piece on the number line can be described as soft bracket negative infinity

02:03:18.280 --> 02:03:25.640
negative two hard bracket. And the second piece can be described as soft bracket three halves

02:03:25.640 --> 02:03:33.080
infinity soft bracket. To indicate that x can be in either one of these pieces, I use the union sign,

02:03:33.080 --> 02:03:41.240
which is a U. That means that my answer includes all x values in here together with all x values in

02:03:41.240 --> 02:03:48.760
here. This next example is also a compound inequality, this time joined by an and the and

02:03:48.760 --> 02:03:55.880
means I'm looking for all y values that satisfy both this and this at the same time. Again,

02:03:55.880 --> 02:04:04.840
I can solve each piece separately. On the left, to isolate the y, I need to multiply by negative

02:04:04.840 --> 02:04:13.400
three halves on both sides. So that gives me y is less than negative 12 times negative three halves,

02:04:13.400 --> 02:04:19.720
the greater than flipped to a less than because I was multiplying by negative three halves,

02:04:19.720 --> 02:04:26.680
which is a negative number. If I clean up the right side to get y is less than 18.

02:04:27.080 --> 02:04:34.760
On the right side, I'll start by subtracting two from both sides. And now I'll divide by negative

02:04:34.760 --> 02:04:43.400
four, again, a negative number so that flips the inequality. So that's y is less than three over

02:04:43.400 --> 02:04:49.800
negative four, in other words, y is less than negative three fourths. Again, I'm looking for the y

02:04:50.760 --> 02:04:57.800
values that make both of these statements true at the same time. Let me graph this on the number line.

02:05:00.840 --> 02:05:07.080
The y is less than 18. I can graph that by drawing the number 18.

02:05:08.680 --> 02:05:13.080
I don't want to include it. So I use an empty circle and I shaded everything to the left.

02:05:13.400 --> 02:05:19.480
The statement y is less than negative three fourths, I need to draw in negative three fourths.

02:05:19.480 --> 02:05:27.560
And again, I don't include it, but I do include everything on the left. Since I want the y values

02:05:27.560 --> 02:05:33.400
for which both of these statements are true, I need the y values that are in both colored blue

02:05:33.400 --> 02:05:40.120
and colored red. And so that would be this part right here. I'll just draw it above so you can

02:05:40.120 --> 02:05:47.480
see it easily. So that would be all the numbers from negative three fourths and lower, not including

02:05:47.480 --> 02:05:52.040
negative three fourths. Since those are the parts of the number line that have both red and blue

02:05:52.040 --> 02:05:57.880
colors on them. In interval notation, my final answer will be soft bracket negative infinity

02:05:58.520 --> 02:06:05.320
to negative three fourths soft bracket. As my final example, I have an inequality

02:06:05.880 --> 02:06:11.400
that has two inequality signs in it negative three is less than or equal to six x minus two is less

02:06:11.400 --> 02:06:18.280
than 10. I can think of this as being a compound inequality with two parts negative three x is

02:06:18.280 --> 02:06:25.400
less than or equal to six x minus two. And at the same time, six x minus two is less than 10.

02:06:26.200 --> 02:06:31.960
I could solve this in two pieces as before. But instead, it's a little more efficient to just solve

02:06:32.040 --> 02:06:40.280
it all at once by doing the same thing to all three sides. So as a first step, I'll add two to

02:06:40.280 --> 02:06:47.400
all three sides. That gives me negative one is less than equal to six x is less than 12. And now

02:06:47.400 --> 02:06:53.720
I'm going to divide all three sides by six to isolate the x. So that gives me negative one six

02:06:53.720 --> 02:07:00.760
is less than or equal to x is less than two. If we'd solved it instead in two pieces above,

02:07:00.840 --> 02:07:06.040
we'd end up with the same thing. Because we get negative one six is less than or equal to x from

02:07:06.040 --> 02:07:12.680
this piece. And we get x is less than two on this piece. And because of the and statement, that's

02:07:12.680 --> 02:07:17.160
the same thing as saying negative one six is less than or equal to x, which is less than two.

02:07:18.600 --> 02:07:24.280
Either way we do it. Let's see if what it looks like on the number line. So on the number line,

02:07:24.280 --> 02:07:33.800
we're looking for things that are between two and negative one six, including the negative one six,

02:07:33.800 --> 02:07:39.960
but not including the two. In interval notation, we can write this as hard bracket negative one six

02:07:40.520 --> 02:07:47.800
to soft bracket. In this video, we solved linear inequalities, including some compound inequalities

02:07:47.800 --> 02:07:55.000
joined by the conjunctions and and or. Remember, when we're working with and we're looking for

02:07:55.000 --> 02:08:01.800
places on the number line, where both statements are true. That is, we're looking for the overlap

02:08:01.800 --> 02:08:09.240
on the number line. In this case, the points on the number line that are colored both red and blue

02:08:09.240 --> 02:08:15.880
at the same time. When we're working with or statements, we're looking for places where

02:08:15.880 --> 02:08:21.000
either one or the other statement is true or both. On the number line,

02:08:22.760 --> 02:08:28.520
this corresponds to points that are colored either red or blue or both. And in this picture,

02:08:28.520 --> 02:08:34.920
that would actually correspond to the entire number line. In this video, we'll solve inequalities

02:08:34.920 --> 02:08:40.920
involving polynomials like this one, and inequalities involving rational expressions like this one.

02:08:41.800 --> 02:08:48.520
Let's start with a simple example, maybe a deceptively simple example. If you see the inequality

02:08:48.520 --> 02:08:54.760
x squared is less than four, you might be very tempted to take the square root of both sides and

02:08:54.760 --> 02:09:00.920
get something like x is less than two as your answer. But in fact, that doesn't work.

02:09:01.320 --> 02:09:11.480
To see why it's not correct, consider the x value of negative 10. Negative 10 satisfies

02:09:12.680 --> 02:09:20.520
the inequality x is less than two, since negative 10 is less than two, but it doesn't satisfy the

02:09:20.520 --> 02:09:28.920
inequality x squared is less than four, since negative 10 squared is 100, which is not less than

02:09:28.920 --> 02:09:36.200
four. So these two inequalities are not the same. And it doesn't work to solve a quadratic

02:09:36.200 --> 02:09:41.480
inequality just to take the square root of both sides. You might be thinking part of why this

02:09:41.480 --> 02:09:47.400
reasoning is wrong is we've ignored the negative two option, right? If we had the equation x squared

02:09:47.400 --> 02:09:53.640
equals four, then x equals two would just be one option, x equals negative two would be another

02:09:53.640 --> 02:09:59.320
solution. So somehow our solution to this inequality should take this into account.

02:10:00.440 --> 02:10:06.120
In fact, a good way to solve an inequality involving x squared or higher power terms

02:10:06.120 --> 02:10:12.360
is to solve the associated equation first. But before we even do that, I like to pull

02:10:12.360 --> 02:10:16.680
everything over to one side so that my inequality has zero on the other side.

02:10:17.000 --> 02:10:22.680
So for our equation, I'll subtract four from both sides to get x squared minus four is less than

02:10:22.680 --> 02:10:30.200
zero. Now, I'm going to actually solve the associated equation, x squared minus four is equal

02:10:30.200 --> 02:10:39.080
to zero. I can do this by factoring to x minus two times x plus two is equal to zero. And I'll set

02:10:39.560 --> 02:10:45.560
my factors equal to zero, and I get x equals two and x equals minus two.

02:10:47.000 --> 02:10:52.520
Now, I'm going to plot the solutions to my equation on the number line. So I write down negative two

02:10:52.520 --> 02:10:58.040
and two. Those are the places where my expression x squared minus four is equal to zero.

02:10:59.800 --> 02:11:04.440
Since I want to find where x squared minus four is less than zero, I want to know where

02:11:04.440 --> 02:11:10.120
this expression x squared minus four is positive or negative. A good way to find that out is to

02:11:10.120 --> 02:11:16.680
plug in test values. So first I'll plug in a test value in this area of the number line,

02:11:17.240 --> 02:11:23.720
something less than negative two say x equals negative three. If I plug in negative three

02:11:23.720 --> 02:11:30.600
into x squared minus four, I get negative three squared minus four, which is nine minus four,

02:11:30.600 --> 02:11:37.960
which is five. That's a positive number. So at negative three, the expression x squared minus

02:11:37.960 --> 02:11:43.800
four is positive. And in fact, everywhere on this region of the number line, my expression is going

02:11:43.800 --> 02:11:48.760
to be positive, because it can't jump from positive to negative without going through a place where

02:11:48.760 --> 02:11:54.680
it's zero. I can figure out whether x squared minus four is positive or negative on this region,

02:11:54.680 --> 02:11:58.520
and on this region of the number line, by plugging in test values similarly.

02:11:59.800 --> 02:12:06.040
A value to plug in between negative two and two, a nice value is x equals zero, zero squared minus

02:12:06.040 --> 02:12:11.240
four, that's negative four, a negative number. So I know that my expression x squared minus four

02:12:11.240 --> 02:12:17.720
is negative on this whole interval. Finally, I can plug in something like x equals 10, something

02:12:17.720 --> 02:12:24.280
bigger than two, and I get 10 squared minus four. Without even computing that, I can tell that that's

02:12:24.280 --> 02:12:29.000
going to be a positive number. And that's all that's important. Again, since I want x squared

02:12:29.000 --> 02:12:33.800
minus four to be less than zero, I'm looking for the places on this number line, where I'm getting

02:12:33.800 --> 02:12:40.280
negatives. So I'll shade that in on my number line, it's in here, not including the endpoints,

02:12:40.280 --> 02:12:44.680
because the endpoints are where my expression x squared minus four is equal to zero, and I want

02:12:44.680 --> 02:12:51.880
it strictly less than zero. I can write my answer as an inequality, negative two is less than x is

02:12:51.960 --> 02:12:58.120
less than two, or an interval notation as soft bracket negative two to soft bracket.

02:12:59.800 --> 02:13:05.640
Our next example, we can solve similarly. First, we'll move everything to one side,

02:13:06.440 --> 02:13:13.800
so that our inequality is x cubed minus five x squared minus six x is greater than or equal to

02:13:13.800 --> 02:13:22.200
zero. Next, we'll solve the associated equation by factoring. So first, I'll write down the equation.

02:13:23.000 --> 02:13:30.680
Now I'll factor out an x. And now I'll factor the quadratic. So the solutions to my equation

02:13:30.680 --> 02:13:37.080
are x equals zero x equals six and x equals negative one. I'll write the solutions to the

02:13:37.080 --> 02:13:49.720
equation on the number line. So that's negative one, zero, and six. That's where my expression x times

02:13:49.720 --> 02:13:59.960
x minus six times x plus one is equal to zero. But I want to find where it's greater than or equal

02:13:59.960 --> 02:14:07.080
to zero. So again, I can use test values. I can plug in, for example, x equals negative two,

02:14:07.080 --> 02:14:12.840
either to this version of expression, or to this factored version. Since I only care whether my

02:14:12.840 --> 02:14:17.720
answer is positive or negative, it's sometimes easier to use the factored version. For example,

02:14:17.720 --> 02:14:27.400
when x is negative two, this factor is negative. But this factor x minus six is also negative

02:14:27.400 --> 02:14:35.720
when I plug in negative two for x. Finally, x plus one, when I plug in negative two for x,

02:14:35.720 --> 02:14:40.280
that's negative one, that's also negative. And a negative times a negative times a negative

02:14:40.280 --> 02:14:48.600
gives me a negative number. If I plug in something between negative one and zero, say x equals negative

02:14:48.600 --> 02:14:54.920
one half, then I'm going to get a negative for this factor, a negative for this factor,

02:14:54.920 --> 02:15:01.560
but a positive for this third factor. Negative times negative times positive gives me a positive.

02:15:03.240 --> 02:15:11.800
For a test value between zero and six, let's try x equals one. Now I'll get a positive for

02:15:11.800 --> 02:15:19.080
this factor, a negative for this factor, and a positive for this factor. Positive times a negative

02:15:19.080 --> 02:15:26.200
times a positive gives me a negative. Finally, for a test value bigger than six, we could use

02:15:26.200 --> 02:15:35.000
say x equals 100. That's going to give me positive, positive, positive. So my product will be positive.

02:15:37.160 --> 02:15:42.760
Since I want values where my expression is greater than or equal to zero, I want the places where it

02:15:42.760 --> 02:15:54.520
equals zero and the places where it's positive. So my final answer will be close bracket negative

02:15:54.520 --> 02:16:03.240
one to zero close bracket union close bracket six to infinity. As our final example, let's consider

02:16:03.240 --> 02:16:10.760
the rational inequality x squared plus six x plus nine divided by x minus one is less than or equal

02:16:10.760 --> 02:16:17.400
to zero. Although it might be tempting to clear the denominator and multiply both sides by x minus

02:16:17.400 --> 02:16:23.720
one, it's dangerous to do that, because x minus one could be a positive number, but it could also

02:16:23.720 --> 02:16:28.360
be a negative number. And when you multiply both sides by a negative number, you have to reverse

02:16:28.360 --> 02:16:35.000
the inequality. Although it's possible to solve the inequality this way by thinking of cases where

02:16:35.000 --> 02:16:40.280
x minus one is less than zero or better than zero, I think it's much easier just to solve the same

02:16:40.280 --> 02:16:47.240
way as we did before. So we'll start by rewriting so that we move all terms to the left and have zero

02:16:47.240 --> 02:16:53.560
on the right. Well, that's already true. So the next step would be to solve the associated equation.

02:16:56.120 --> 02:17:01.800
That is x squared plus six x plus nine over x minus one is equal to zero.

02:17:02.520 --> 02:17:09.080
That would be where the numerator zero x squared plus six x plus nine is equal to zero. So where x plus

02:17:09.080 --> 02:17:16.840
three squared is zero or x equals negative three. There's one extra step we have to do for rational

02:17:16.840 --> 02:17:23.080
expressions. And that's what we need to find where the expression does not exist. That is,

02:17:23.080 --> 02:17:30.360
let's find where the denominator is zero and that's at x equals one. I'll put all those numbers on

02:17:30.760 --> 02:17:37.160
the number line, the places where my rational expression is equal to zero, and the place where

02:17:37.160 --> 02:17:44.120
my rational expression doesn't exist. Then I can start in with test values. For example, x equals

02:17:44.120 --> 02:17:54.200
minus four, zero and two work. If I plug those values into this expression here, I get a negative

02:17:54.280 --> 02:17:59.960
answer, a negative answer and a positive answer. The reason I need to conclude the values on my

02:17:59.960 --> 02:18:06.520
number line where my denominator zero is because I can my expression can switch from negative to

02:18:06.520 --> 02:18:12.920
positive by passing through a place where my rational expression doesn't exist, as well as

02:18:12.920 --> 02:18:18.280
passing by passing through a place where my rational expression is equal to zero. Now I'm

02:18:18.280 --> 02:18:23.800
looking for where my original expression was less than or equal to zero. So that means I want the

02:18:23.800 --> 02:18:31.080
places on the number line where my expression is equal to zero, and also the places where it's

02:18:31.080 --> 02:18:40.360
negative. So my final answer is x is less than one or an interval notation negative infinity to one.

02:18:42.280 --> 02:18:48.200
In this video, we solved polynomial and rational inequalities by making a number line

02:18:48.200 --> 02:18:56.040
and using test values to make a sign chart. The distance formula can be used to find the

02:18:56.040 --> 02:19:03.640
distance between two points if we know their coordinates. If this first point has coordinates

02:19:03.640 --> 02:19:12.040
x one, y one, and the second point has coordinates x two, y two, then the distance between them

02:19:12.040 --> 02:19:21.320
is given by the formula, the square root of x two minus x one squared plus y two minus y one

02:19:21.320 --> 02:19:28.840
squared. This formula actually comes from the Pythagorean theorem. Let me draw a right triangle

02:19:29.400 --> 02:19:32.360
with these two points as two of its vertices.

02:19:32.600 --> 02:19:42.760
Then the length of this side is the difference between the two x coordinates. Similarly, the

02:19:42.760 --> 02:19:49.320
length of this vertical side is the difference between the two y coordinates. Now the Pythagorean

02:19:49.320 --> 02:19:55.960
theorem says that for any right triangle with sides labeled A and B and hypotenuse labeled C,

02:19:56.760 --> 02:20:03.800
we have that A squared plus B squared equals C squared. Well, if we apply that to this triangle

02:20:03.800 --> 02:20:10.200
here, this hypotenuse is the distance between the two points that we're looking for.

02:20:11.640 --> 02:20:20.200
So Pythagorean theorem says the square of this side length, that is x two minus x one squared

02:20:20.920 --> 02:20:27.800
plus the square of this side length, which is y two minus y one squared

02:20:28.600 --> 02:20:36.920
has to equal the square of the hypotenuse, that is D squared. Taking the square root of both sides

02:20:36.920 --> 02:20:44.360
of this equation, we get the square root of x two minus x one squared plus y two minus y one

02:20:44.360 --> 02:20:50.680
squared is equal to D. We don't have to worry about using plus or minus signs when we take the

02:20:50.680 --> 02:20:57.960
square root because distance is always positive. So we've derived our distance formula. Now let's

02:20:57.960 --> 02:21:07.320
use it in an example. Let's find the distance between the two points negative one five, negative one

02:21:07.560 --> 02:21:17.880
five, maybe over here, and four two. This notation just means that P is the point with

02:21:17.880 --> 02:21:23.960
coordinates negative one five. And Q is the point with coordinates four two.

02:21:26.360 --> 02:21:33.640
We have the distance formula. Let's think of P being the point with coordinates x one y one

02:21:33.640 --> 02:21:40.520
and Q being the point with coordinates x two y two. But as we'll see, it really doesn't matter

02:21:40.520 --> 02:21:50.680
which one is which. Plugging into our formula, we get D is the square root of x two minus x one.

02:21:50.680 --> 02:22:07.320
So that's four minus negative one squared. And then we add y two minus y one. So that's two minus

02:22:07.320 --> 02:22:15.240
five squared. Working out the arithmetic a little bit four minus negative one, that's four plus one

02:22:15.240 --> 02:22:22.840
or five squared plus negative three squared. So that's the square root of 25 plus nine,

02:22:22.840 --> 02:22:29.880
or the square root of 34. Let's see what would have happened if we'd called this first point

02:22:30.760 --> 02:22:38.360
x two y two instead and the second point x one y one. Then we would have gotten the same distance

02:22:38.360 --> 02:22:49.400
formula. But we would have taken negative one minus four. And added the difference of y squared.

02:22:49.400 --> 02:22:58.920
So that's y two five minus two squared. So that gives us the square root of negative five squared

02:22:58.920 --> 02:23:07.560
plus three squared, which works out to the same thing. In this video, we use the distance formula

02:23:07.560 --> 02:23:12.520
to find the distance between two points. When writing down the distance formula, sometimes

02:23:12.520 --> 02:23:17.480
students forget whether this is a plus or minus and whether these are pluses or minuses. One way

02:23:17.480 --> 02:23:22.440
to remember is to think that the distance formula comes from the Pythagorean theorem. That's why

02:23:22.440 --> 02:23:29.560
there's a plus in here. And then a minus in here because we're getting the difference between the

02:23:29.560 --> 02:23:35.960
coordinates to find the lengths of the sides. The midpoint formula helps us find the coordinates

02:23:35.960 --> 02:23:41.800
of the midpoint of a line segment, as long as we know the coordinates of the endpoints.

02:23:43.400 --> 02:23:49.400
So let's call the coordinates of this endpoint x one y one, and the coordinates of this other

02:23:49.400 --> 02:23:58.600
endpoint x two y two. The x coordinate of the midpoint is going to be exactly halfway in between

02:23:58.600 --> 02:24:04.200
the x coordinates of the endpoints. To get a number halfway in between two other numbers,

02:24:04.200 --> 02:24:05.400
we just take the average.

02:24:10.360 --> 02:24:15.880
Similarly, the y coordinate of this midpoint is going to be exactly halfway in between

02:24:15.880 --> 02:24:21.480
the y coordinates of the endpoints. So the y coordinate of the midpoint is going to be the

02:24:21.480 --> 02:24:29.160
average of those y coordinates. So we see that the coordinates of the midpoint

02:24:30.120 --> 02:24:35.960
are x one plus x two over two, y one plus y two over two.

02:24:37.560 --> 02:24:44.760
Let's use this midpoint formula in an example. We want to find the midpoint of the segment

02:24:44.760 --> 02:24:54.920
between the points negative one, five, and four, two.

02:24:57.640 --> 02:25:03.160
Let me draw the line segment between them. So visually the midpoint is going to be somewhere

02:25:03.160 --> 02:25:09.800
around here. But to find its exact coordinates, we're going to use x one plus x two over two,

02:25:09.800 --> 02:25:15.080
and y one plus y two over two, where this first point is coordinates

02:25:16.280 --> 02:25:23.320
x one y one. And the second point has coordinates x two y two. It doesn't actually matter which

02:25:23.320 --> 02:25:28.040
point you decide is x one y one and which one is x two y two. The formula will still give you

02:25:28.040 --> 02:25:35.160
the same answer for the midpoint. So let's see I take my average of my x coordinates. So that's

02:25:36.120 --> 02:25:44.280
negative one plus four over two, and the average of my y coordinates. So that's five plus two over

02:25:44.280 --> 02:25:55.080
two. And I get three halves, seven halves, as the coordinates of my midpoint. In this video,

02:25:55.080 --> 02:26:00.360
we use the midpoint formula to find the midpoint of a line segment, just by taking the average

02:26:00.440 --> 02:26:05.640
of the x coordinates and the average of the y coordinates. This video is about graphs and

02:26:05.640 --> 02:26:13.560
equations of circles. Suppose we want to find the equation of a circle of radius five centered at the

02:26:13.560 --> 02:26:25.720
point three two. It'll look something like this. For any point x y on the circle, we know that

02:26:25.880 --> 02:26:33.080
that the distance of that point x y from the center is equal to the radius, that is five.

02:26:34.200 --> 02:26:41.240
From the distance formula, that distance of five is equal to the square root of the difference of

02:26:41.240 --> 02:26:52.040
the x coordinates. That's x minus three squared, plus the difference of the y coordinates, that's

02:26:52.040 --> 02:27:03.720
y minus two squared. And if I square both sides of that equation, I get five squared is this square

02:27:03.720 --> 02:27:13.160
root squared. In other words, 25 is equal to x minus three squared plus y minus two squared,

02:27:13.160 --> 02:27:20.360
since the square root and the squared undo each other. A lot of times people will write the x minus

02:27:20.360 --> 02:27:25.880
three squared plus y minus two squared on the left side of the equation and the 25 on the right

02:27:25.880 --> 02:27:32.600
side of the equation. This is the standard form for the equation of this circle. The same reasoning

02:27:32.600 --> 02:27:39.000
can be generalized to find the general equation for a circle with radius r centered at a point hk.

02:27:40.680 --> 02:27:48.840
For any point with coordinates x y on the circle, the distance between the point with coordinates

02:27:48.840 --> 02:27:56.920
x y and the point with coordinates hk is equal to the radius r. So we have that the distance

02:27:56.920 --> 02:28:03.240
is equal to r, but by the distance formula, that's the square root of the difference between the x

02:28:03.240 --> 02:28:12.760
coordinates, x minus h squared, plus the difference in the y coordinates, y minus k squared.

02:28:12.760 --> 02:28:23.000
Squaring both sides as before, we get r squared is the square root squared, canceling the square root

02:28:23.000 --> 02:28:31.240
and the squared and rearranging the equation that gives us x minus h squared plus y minus k squared

02:28:31.240 --> 02:28:38.760
equals r squared. That's the general formula for a circle with radius r and center hk.

02:28:38.760 --> 02:28:47.240
Notice that the coordinates h and k are subtracted here. The two squares are added because they are

02:28:47.240 --> 02:28:53.000
in the distance formula and the radius is squared on the other side. If you remember this general

02:28:53.000 --> 02:28:58.920
formula, that makes it easy to write down the equation for a circle. For example, if we want the

02:28:58.920 --> 02:29:12.680
equation for a circle of radius six and center at zero negative three, then we have r equals six

02:29:13.320 --> 02:29:25.880
and hk is our zero negative three. So plugging into the formula, we get x minus zero squared plus

02:29:25.880 --> 02:29:35.160
y minus negative three squared equals six squared, or simplified, this is x squared plus y plus three

02:29:35.160 --> 02:29:43.160
squared equals 36. Suppose we're given an equation like this one, and we want to decide if it's the

02:29:43.160 --> 02:29:50.120
equation of a circle. And if so, what's the center and what's the radius? Well, this equation matches

02:29:50.120 --> 02:29:57.000
the form for a circle x minus h squared plus y minus k squared equals r squared.

02:29:57.000 --> 02:30:05.240
If we let h be five, y be negative six, since that way, subtracting a negative six is like

02:30:05.240 --> 02:30:13.560
adding a six. Five must be our r squared. So that means that r is the square root of five.

02:30:14.360 --> 02:30:23.000
So this is our radius. And our center is the point five negative six. And this is indeed

02:30:23.000 --> 02:30:29.000
the equation for a circle, which we could then graph by putting down the center

02:30:30.040 --> 02:30:33.160
and estimating the radius, which is a little bit more than two.

02:30:36.520 --> 02:30:41.640
This equation might not look like the equation of a circle, but it actually can be transformed

02:30:42.360 --> 02:30:47.640
to look like the equation of a circle. We're trying to make it look like something of the form

02:30:47.640 --> 02:30:55.640
x minus h squared plus y minus k squared equals r squared. First, I'd like to get rid of the

02:30:55.640 --> 02:30:59.880
coefficients in front of the x squared and the y squared. So I'm going to divide everything by nine.

02:31:00.760 --> 02:31:09.800
This gives me x squared plus y squared plus eight x minus two y plus four equals zero. Next,

02:31:09.800 --> 02:31:15.480
I'm going to group the x terms together, the x squared and the eight x. So I'll write x squared

02:31:15.480 --> 02:31:20.440
plus eight x. I'll group the y terms together, the y squared minus two y.

02:31:22.600 --> 02:31:26.280
And I'll subtract the four over to the other side.

02:31:28.360 --> 02:31:32.520
This still doesn't look much like the equation of a circle. But as the next step,

02:31:32.520 --> 02:31:37.240
I'm going to do something called completing the square. I'm going to take this coefficient

02:31:37.240 --> 02:31:45.080
of x eight, divide it by two and then square it. In other words, eight over two squared,

02:31:45.080 --> 02:31:51.080
that's four squared, which is 16. I'm going to add 16 to both sides of my equation.

02:31:52.920 --> 02:32:00.680
So add the 16 here. And on the other side. Now I'm going to do the same thing to the

02:32:00.680 --> 02:32:09.560
coefficient of y negative two divided by two is negative one square that and I get one. So now I'm

02:32:09.560 --> 02:32:17.000
going to add a one to both sides, but I'll put it near the y terms. So add a one there. And then

02:32:17.000 --> 02:32:22.520
to keep things balanced, I have to add it to the other side. On the right side, I have the number

02:32:22.520 --> 02:32:29.640
13. On the left side, I can wrap up this expression x squared plus eight x plus 16

02:32:30.440 --> 02:32:39.640
into x plus four squared. To convince you that's correct. If we multiply out x plus four times x

02:32:39.640 --> 02:32:48.360
plus four, we get x squared plus four x plus four x plus 16, or x squared plus eight x plus 16,

02:32:48.360 --> 02:32:56.920
the same thing we have right here. Similarly, we can wrap up y squared minus two y plus one as

02:32:58.840 --> 02:33:06.440
y minus one squared. Again, I'll work out the distribution down here. That's y squared minus

02:33:06.440 --> 02:33:12.040
y minus y plus one or y squared minus two y plus one, just like we have up here.

02:33:12.440 --> 02:33:20.360
If you're wondering how I knew to use four and minus one, the four came from taking half of eight,

02:33:20.360 --> 02:33:26.760
and the minus one came from taking half the negative two. Now we have an equation for a

02:33:26.760 --> 02:33:34.840
circle in standard form. And we can read off the center, which is negative four, negative one,

02:33:35.480 --> 02:33:45.640
and the radius, which is the square root of 13. It might seem like magic that this trick of taking

02:33:45.640 --> 02:33:51.080
half of this coefficient and squaring it and adding it to both sides, let's us wrap up this

02:33:51.080 --> 02:33:57.080
expression into this expression, that's perfect square. But to see why that works, let's take a

02:33:57.080 --> 02:34:03.560
look at what happens if we expand out x minus h squared, the thing that we're trying to get to.

02:34:05.400 --> 02:34:13.480
So if we expand that out, x minus h squared, which is x minus h times x minus h is,

02:34:14.360 --> 02:34:24.520
which multiplies out to x squared minus hx minus hx plus h squared, or x squared minus two hx plus

02:34:24.520 --> 02:34:33.720
h squared. Now if we start out with this part, with some x squared term and some coefficient of x,

02:34:33.720 --> 02:34:39.320
and we're trying to decide what to add on in order to wrap it up into x minus h squared,

02:34:39.320 --> 02:34:46.440
the thing to add on is h squared here, which comes from half of this coefficient squared,

02:34:46.440 --> 02:34:51.880
right, because half of negative two h is eight negative h, square that you get the h squared.

02:34:51.880 --> 02:34:59.240
And then when we do wrap it up, it's half of this coefficient of x that appears right here.

02:34:59.240 --> 02:35:04.840
This trick of completing the square is really handy for turning an equation for a circle in

02:35:04.840 --> 02:35:10.920
disguise into the standard equation for the circle. In this video, we found the standard

02:35:10.920 --> 02:35:19.080
equation for a circle, x minus h squared plus y minus k squared equals r squared, where r is the

02:35:19.080 --> 02:35:30.680
radius, and hk is the center. We also showed a method of completing the square. When you have

02:35:30.680 --> 02:35:37.720
an equation for a circle in disguise, completing the square will help you rewrite it into the standard

02:35:37.720 --> 02:35:46.840
form. This video is about graphs and equations of lines. Here we're given the graph of a line,

02:35:46.840 --> 02:35:54.360
we want to find the equation. One standard format for the equation of a line is y equals mx plus b.

02:35:55.400 --> 02:36:05.000
Here m represents the slope and b represents the y intercept, the y value where the line crosses

02:36:05.000 --> 02:36:13.720
the y axis. The slope is equal to the rise over the run, or sometimes this is written as the change

02:36:13.720 --> 02:36:23.320
in y values over the change in x values, or in other words, y2 minus y1 over x2 minus x1, where

02:36:24.200 --> 02:36:33.160
x1, y1, and x2, y2 are points on the line. While we could use any two points on the line to find

02:36:33.160 --> 02:36:39.400
the slope, it's convenient to use points where the x and y coordinates are integers, that is

02:36:39.400 --> 02:36:45.800
points where the line passes through grid points. So here would be one convenient point to use,

02:36:45.800 --> 02:36:53.160
and here's another convenient point to use. The coordinates of the first point are one, two,

02:36:53.160 --> 02:37:00.040
and the next point, this is, let's see, five, negative one. Now I can find the slope by looking

02:37:00.040 --> 02:37:08.200
at the rise over the run. So as I go through a run of this distance, I go through a rise of that

02:37:08.200 --> 02:37:13.320
distance, it's actually going to be a negative rise or a fall because my line is pointing down.

02:37:13.320 --> 02:37:18.920
So let's see, counting off squares, this is a run of one, two, three, four squares and a rise of

02:37:19.560 --> 02:37:27.960
one, two, three, so negative three. So my slope is going to be negative three over four.

02:37:29.800 --> 02:37:33.880
I got that answer by counting squares, but I could have also gotten it by

02:37:33.880 --> 02:37:38.200
looking at the difference in my y values over the difference in my x values.

02:37:38.200 --> 02:37:47.080
That is, I could have done negative one minus two, that's from my difference in y values,

02:37:47.080 --> 02:37:56.280
and divide that by my difference in x values, which is five minus one, that gives me negative three

02:37:56.280 --> 02:38:07.000
over four as before. So my m is negative three fourths. Now I need to figure out the value of b,

02:38:07.000 --> 02:38:13.240
my y intercept. Well, I could just read it off the graph, it looks like approximately 2.75,

02:38:13.240 --> 02:38:18.200
but if I want to be more accurate, I can again use a point that has integer coordinates that I know

02:38:18.200 --> 02:38:25.160
its exact coordinates. So either this point or that point, let's try this point. And I can start

02:38:25.160 --> 02:38:33.320
off with my equation y equals mx plus b, that is y equals negative three fourths x plus b,

02:38:33.320 --> 02:38:45.000
and I can plug in the point one two for my x and y. So that gives me two equals negative three fourths

02:38:45.000 --> 02:38:52.360
times one plus b, solving for b, let's see that's two equals negative three fourths plus b,

02:38:52.920 --> 02:38:59.880
so add three fourths to both sides, that's two plus three fourths equals b. So b is

02:39:00.920 --> 02:39:06.440
eight fourths plus three fourths, which is 11 fourths, which is actually just what I eyeballed it

02:39:06.440 --> 02:39:15.160
to be. So now I can write out my final equation for my line y equals negative three fourths x plus

02:39:15.160 --> 02:39:22.280
11 fourths by plugging in for m and b. Next, let's find the equation for this horizontal line.

02:39:23.960 --> 02:39:29.960
A horizontal line has slope zero. So if we think of it as y equals mx plus b,

02:39:30.600 --> 02:39:37.560
m is going to be zero. In other words, it's just y equals b, y is some constant. So if we can figure

02:39:37.560 --> 02:39:44.920
out what that that constant y value is, it looks like it's two, let's see that's three,

02:39:44.920 --> 02:39:49.960
three and a half, we can just write down the equation directly, y equals 3.5.

02:39:52.520 --> 02:39:58.840
For a vertical line, like this one, it doesn't really have a slope. I mean, if you tried to do

02:39:58.840 --> 02:40:05.880
the rise over the run, there's no run. So I guess you'd be dividing by zero and get an infinite slope.

02:40:05.880 --> 02:40:12.600
But but instead, we just think of it as an equation of the form x equals something.

02:40:13.240 --> 02:40:19.320
And in this case, x equals negative two. Notice that all of the points on our line have the same

02:40:19.320 --> 02:40:25.000
x coordinate of negative two and the y coordinate can be anything. So this is how we write the

02:40:25.000 --> 02:40:32.120
equation for a vertical line. In this example, we're not shown a graph of the line, we're just

02:40:32.120 --> 02:40:37.640
told that it goes through two points. But knowing that it goes through two points is enough to find

02:40:37.640 --> 02:40:45.640
the equation for the line. First, we can find the slope by taking the difference in y values

02:40:45.640 --> 02:40:53.400
over the difference in x values. So that's negative three minus two over four minus one,

02:40:53.400 --> 02:41:02.520
which is negative five thirds. So we can use the standard equation for the line,

02:41:02.520 --> 02:41:11.000
this is called the slope intercept form. And we can plug in negative five thirds.

02:41:11.640 --> 02:41:18.120
And we can use one point, either one will do, we'll still get the same final answer. So let's

02:41:18.120 --> 02:41:27.400
use one two and plug that in to get two equals negative five thirds times one plus B. And so B is

02:41:28.280 --> 02:41:35.800
two plus five thirds, which is six thirds plus five thirds, which is 11 thirds. So our equation

02:41:35.800 --> 02:41:47.560
is y equals negative five thirds x plus 11 thirds. This is method one. Method two uses a slightly

02:41:47.640 --> 02:41:54.200
different form of the equation. It's called the point slope form. And it goes y minus y not

02:41:54.200 --> 02:42:04.280
is equal to m times x minus x not, where x not y not is a point on the line. And am again is the

02:42:04.280 --> 02:42:11.080
slope. So we calculate the slope the same way, by taking a difference in y values over difference

02:42:11.080 --> 02:42:22.200
in x values. But then we can simply plug in any point. For example, the point one two will work,

02:42:22.200 --> 02:42:31.320
we can plug one in for x not and two in for y not in this point slope form, that gives us y

02:42:31.640 --> 02:42:41.560
minus two is equal to minus five thirds x minus one. Notice that these two equations while they may

02:42:41.560 --> 02:42:47.880
look different are actually equivalent. Because if I distribute the negative five thirds, and then

02:42:48.040 --> 02:42:50.600
and then add the two to both sides,

02:42:58.920 --> 02:43:01.560
I get the same equation as above.

02:43:05.160 --> 02:43:10.680
So we've seen two ways of finding the equation for the line, using the slope intercept form

02:43:10.760 --> 02:43:19.160
and using the point slope form. In this video, we saw that you can find the equation for a line

02:43:19.160 --> 02:43:27.960
if you know the slope. And you know one point. You can also find the equation for the line if

02:43:27.960 --> 02:43:35.240
you know two points, because you can use the two points to get the slope, and then plug in one of

02:43:35.240 --> 02:43:41.720
those points to figure out the rest of the equation. We saw two standard forms for the

02:43:41.720 --> 02:43:50.360
equation of a line. The slope intercept form y equals mx plus b, where m is the slope, and b is the

02:43:50.360 --> 02:44:01.080
y intercept. And the point slope form y minus y not equals m times x minus x not, where m again

02:44:01.080 --> 02:44:11.240
is the slope, and x not y not is a point on the line. This video is about finding parallel and

02:44:11.240 --> 02:44:19.400
perpendicular lines. Suppose we have a line of slope three fourths, in other words, the rise

02:44:19.640 --> 02:44:30.840
over the run is three over four. Then any other line that's parallel to this line will have the same

02:44:30.840 --> 02:44:40.840
slope, the same rise over run. So that's our first fact to keep in mind. Parallel lines have the same

02:44:40.840 --> 02:44:47.480
slopes. Suppose on the other hand, we want to find a line perpendicular to our original line with

02:44:48.440 --> 02:44:56.920
its original slope of three fourths. A perpendicular line, in other words, a line at a 90 degree

02:44:56.920 --> 02:45:03.560
angle to our original line, will have a slope that's the negative reciprocal, the opposite

02:45:03.560 --> 02:45:10.520
reciprocal of our original slope. So we take the reciprocal of three fourths, that's four thirds,

02:45:10.520 --> 02:45:16.760
and we make it its opposite by changing it from positive to negative. So I'll write this as a

02:45:16.760 --> 02:45:24.760
principle that perpendicular lines have opposite reciprocal slopes. To get the hang of what it

02:45:24.760 --> 02:45:30.760
means to be an opposite reciprocal, let's look at a few examples. So here's the original slope,

02:45:30.760 --> 02:45:36.440
and this will be the opposite reciprocal, which would represent the slope of our perpendicular

02:45:36.440 --> 02:45:43.080
line. So for example, if m1 was two, then the opposite reciprocal, the reciprocal of two is

02:45:43.080 --> 02:45:51.160
one half opposite means I changed the sign. If the first slope turned out to be say negative one

02:45:51.160 --> 02:45:58.360
third, the reciprocal of one third is three over one or just three. And the opposite means I change

02:45:58.360 --> 02:46:06.520
it from a negative to a positive. So my perpendicular slope would be would be three. One more example,

02:46:06.520 --> 02:46:13.080
if I started off with the slope of say seven halves, then the reciprocal of that would be

02:46:13.080 --> 02:46:19.560
two sevenths, and I change it to an opposite reciprocal by changing the positive to a negative.

02:46:20.920 --> 02:46:23.800
Let's use these two principles in some examples.

02:46:25.880 --> 02:46:30.840
In our first example, we need to find the equation of a line that's parallel to this one,

02:46:30.840 --> 02:46:36.760
and goes through the point negative three two. Well, in order to get started, I need to figure

02:46:36.760 --> 02:46:42.920
out the slope of this line. So let me put this line into a more standard form the the slope intercept

02:46:42.920 --> 02:46:50.200
form. So I'll start with three y minus four x plus six equals zero, I'm going to solve for y to put

02:46:50.200 --> 02:46:57.400
it in this this more standard form. So I'll say three y equals four x minus six, and then divide

02:46:57.400 --> 02:47:04.920
by three to get y equals four thirds x minus six thirds is divided all my terms by three, I can

02:47:05.480 --> 02:47:12.600
simplify that a little bit y equals four thirds x minus two. Now I can read off the slope of my

02:47:12.600 --> 02:47:20.440
original line. And one is four thirds. That means my slope of my new line, my parallel line will

02:47:20.440 --> 02:47:29.960
also be four thirds. So my new line will have the equation y equals four thirds x plus b for some b,

02:47:29.960 --> 02:47:34.760
of course, b will probably not be negative two, like it was for the first line, it'll be something

02:47:34.760 --> 02:47:40.040
else determined by the fact that it goes through this point negative three two. To figure out what

02:47:40.040 --> 02:47:46.920
b is, I'll plug in the point negative three two for negative three for x, and two for y. So that

02:47:46.920 --> 02:47:55.400
gives me two equals four thirds times negative three plus b, and I'll solve for b. So let's see.

02:47:55.400 --> 02:48:03.400
First, let me just simplify. So two equals, this is negative 12 thirds plus b, or in other words,

02:48:03.400 --> 02:48:10.680
two is negative four plus b. So that means that b is going to be six. And my my parallel line will

02:48:10.680 --> 02:48:19.560
have the equation y equals four thirds x plus six. Next, let's find the equation of a line

02:48:19.560 --> 02:48:25.960
that's perpendicular to a given line through and go through a given point. Again, in order to get

02:48:25.960 --> 02:48:31.240
started, I need to find what the slope of this given line is. So I'll rewrite it. Well, first

02:48:31.240 --> 02:48:38.920
I'll just copy it over six x plus three y equals four. And then I can put it in the standard slope

02:48:38.920 --> 02:48:45.960
intercept form by solving for y. So three y is negative six x plus four, divide everything by

02:48:45.960 --> 02:48:55.320
three, I get y equals negative six thirds x plus four thirds. So y is negative two x plus four thirds.

02:48:55.320 --> 02:49:01.560
So on my original slope of my original line is negative two, which means my perpendicular slope

02:49:01.560 --> 02:49:06.840
is the opposite reciprocal. So I take the reciprocal of negative two, that's negative

02:49:06.840 --> 02:49:12.600
one half and I change the sign. So that gives me one half as the slope of my perpendicular line.

02:49:13.320 --> 02:49:22.360
Now my new line, I know it's going to be y equals one half x plus b for some b. And I can plug in

02:49:22.360 --> 02:49:32.600
my point on my new line. So one for y and four for x and solve for b. So I get one equals two

02:49:32.600 --> 02:49:39.880
plus b. So b is negative one. And so my new line has equation one half x minus one.

02:49:42.600 --> 02:49:46.760
These next two examples are a little bit different, because now we're looking at

02:49:46.760 --> 02:49:56.280
a line parallel to a completely horizontal line. Let me draw this line y equals three. So the y

02:49:56.360 --> 02:50:02.920
coordinate is always three, which means that my line will be a horizontal line through that height

02:50:02.920 --> 02:50:09.960
at height y equals three. If I want something parallel to this line, it will also be a horizontal

02:50:09.960 --> 02:50:16.120
line. Since it goes through the point negative two one, let's see negative two one, it has to go

02:50:16.120 --> 02:50:23.480
through that point there. It's going to have always have a y coordinate of one, the same as

02:50:23.480 --> 02:50:28.600
the y coordinate of the point it goes through. So my answer will just be y equals one.

02:50:30.600 --> 02:50:37.800
In the next example, we want a line that's perpendicular to the line y equals four, another

02:50:39.080 --> 02:50:46.040
horizontal line y equals four. But perpendicular means I'm going to need a vertical line. So I need

02:50:46.040 --> 02:50:56.440
a vertical line that goes through the point three, four. Okay. And so I'm going to draw a vertical

02:50:56.440 --> 02:51:04.760
line there. Now vertical lines have the form x equals something for their equation. And to find

02:51:04.760 --> 02:51:09.000
what x equals, I just need to look at the x coordinate of the point I'm going through,

02:51:09.080 --> 02:51:16.280
this point three, four. So that x coordinate is three. And all the points on this, this perpendicular

02:51:16.280 --> 02:51:21.160
and vertical line have x coordinate three. So my answer is x equals three.

02:51:27.160 --> 02:51:32.040
In this video, we use the fact that parallel lines have the same slope. And perpendicular lines

02:51:32.040 --> 02:51:37.320
have opposite reciprocal slopes to find the equations of parallel and perpendicular lines.

02:51:39.000 --> 02:51:42.680
This video introduces functions and their domains and ranges.

02:51:44.120 --> 02:51:50.120
A function is a correspondence between input numbers, usually the x values,

02:51:50.120 --> 02:51:56.760
and output numbers, usually the y values, that sends each input number to exactly one output

02:51:56.760 --> 02:52:04.600
number. Sometimes a function is thought of as a rule or machine in which you can feed in

02:52:05.160 --> 02:52:13.560
x values as input and get out y values as output. So a non-mathematical example of a function might

02:52:13.560 --> 02:52:21.320
be the biological mother function, which takes as input any person and gives as output their

02:52:21.320 --> 02:52:29.400
biological mother. This function satisfies the condition that each input number object person

02:52:29.400 --> 02:52:36.760
in this case gets sent to exactly one output person because if you take any person, they just

02:52:36.760 --> 02:52:43.320
have one biological mother. So that rule does give you a function. But if I change things around

02:52:43.960 --> 02:52:51.720
and just use the mother function, which sends to each person their mother, that's no longer going

02:52:51.720 --> 02:52:55.960
to be a function because there are some people who have more than one mother, right? They could have

02:52:55.960 --> 02:53:01.720
a biological mother and adopted mother or a mother and a stepmother or any number of situations.

02:53:01.720 --> 02:53:07.080
So since there's at least some people who you would put it as input and then you'd

02:53:07.080 --> 02:53:13.000
get like more than one possible output, that violates this rule of functions. It would not be

02:53:13.000 --> 02:53:18.200
a function. Now most of the time we'll work with functions that are described with equations, not

02:53:18.200 --> 02:53:23.480
in terms of mothers. So for example we could have the function y equals x squared plus one.

02:53:23.640 --> 02:53:30.200
This can also be written as f of x equals x squared plus one. Here f of x is function notation

02:53:30.200 --> 02:53:38.120
that stands for the output value of y. Notice that this notation is not representing multiplication.

02:53:38.120 --> 02:53:44.920
We're not multiplying f by x. Instead, we're going to be putting in a value for x as input

02:53:44.920 --> 02:53:52.120
and getting out a value of f of x or y. For example, if we want to evaluate f of two,

02:53:52.600 --> 02:53:59.800
we're plugging in two as input for x either in this equation or in that equation. Since

02:54:01.000 --> 02:54:10.520
f of two means two squared plus one, f of two is going to equal five. Similarly f of five means I

02:54:10.520 --> 02:54:19.560
plug in five for x. So that's going to be five squared plus one or 26. Sometimes it's useful

02:54:19.560 --> 02:54:24.680
to evaluate a function on a more complicated expression involving other variables. In this

02:54:24.680 --> 02:54:30.200
case, remember the functions value on any expression is just what you get when you

02:54:30.200 --> 02:54:39.480
plug in that whole expression for x. So f of a plus three is going to be the quantity a plus

02:54:39.480 --> 02:54:49.080
three squared plus one. We could rewrite that as a squared plus six a plus nine plus one,

02:54:49.080 --> 02:54:56.600
or a squared plus six a plus 10. When evaluating a function on a complex expression, it's important

02:54:56.600 --> 02:55:03.480
to keep the parentheses when you plug in for x. That way, you evaluate the function on the whole

02:55:03.480 --> 02:55:14.600
expression. For example, it would be wrong to write f of a plus three equals a plus three squared

02:55:14.600 --> 02:55:19.800
plus one without the parentheses, because that would imply we were just squaring the three and

02:55:19.800 --> 02:55:27.960
not the whole expression a plus three. Sometimes the function is described with a graph instead

02:55:27.960 --> 02:55:37.080
of an equation. In this example, this graph is supposed to represent the function g of x. Not all

02:55:37.080 --> 02:55:42.840
graphs actually represent functions. For example, the graph of a circle doesn't represent a function.

02:55:43.640 --> 02:55:49.160
That's because the graph of a circle violates the vertical line test, you can draw a vertical line,

02:55:49.160 --> 02:55:55.160
and I'll intersect the graph in more than one point. But our graph at left satisfies the vertical

02:55:55.160 --> 02:56:00.680
line test. Any vertical line intersects the graph and at most one point. That means it's a function

02:56:00.680 --> 02:56:07.800
because every x value will have at most one y value that corresponds to it. Let's evaluate

02:56:07.800 --> 02:56:15.560
g of two. Note that two is an x value. And we'll use the graph to find the corresponding y value.

02:56:16.520 --> 02:56:23.160
So I look for two on the x axis, and find the point on the graph that has that x value. That's

02:56:23.160 --> 02:56:31.960
right here. Now I can look at the y value of that point looks like three, and therefore g of two is

02:56:31.960 --> 02:56:39.400
equal to three. If I try to do the same thing to evaluate g of five, I run into trouble. Five is an

02:56:39.400 --> 02:56:46.120
x value. I look for it on the x axis. But there's no point on the graph that has that x value.

02:56:46.520 --> 02:56:54.120
Therefore, g of five is undefined, or we can say it does not exist. The question of what x values and

02:56:54.120 --> 02:57:01.160
y values make sense for a function leads us to a discussion of domain and range. The domain of a

02:57:01.160 --> 02:57:07.320
function is all possible x values that make sense for that function. The range is the y values that

02:57:07.320 --> 02:57:13.560
make sense for the function. In this example, we saw that the x value of five didn't have a

02:57:14.360 --> 02:57:20.760
corresponding y value for this function. So the x value of five is not in the domain of our function

02:57:20.760 --> 02:57:27.880
g. To find the x values in the domain, we have to look at the x values that correspond to points on

02:57:27.880 --> 02:57:35.880
the graph. When we do that is to take the shadow or projection of the graph onto the x axis, and see

02:57:35.880 --> 02:57:45.080
what x values are hit. It looks like we're hitting all x values starting at negative eight and continuing

02:57:45.080 --> 02:57:54.120
up to four. So our domain is the x's between negative eight and four, including those end points,

02:57:54.120 --> 02:57:59.400
or we can write this in interval notation as negative eight comma four with square brackets.

02:58:00.600 --> 02:58:05.640
To find the range of the function, we look for the y values corresponding to points on this graph.

02:58:06.280 --> 02:58:13.080
We can do that by taking the shadow or projection of the graph onto the y axis.

02:58:16.360 --> 02:58:23.160
We seem to be hitting all y values from negative five up through three.

02:58:24.760 --> 02:58:34.040
So our range is wise between negative five and three or an interval notation negative five three

02:58:34.040 --> 02:58:39.720
with square brackets. If we meet a function that's described as an equation instead of a graph,

02:58:40.520 --> 02:58:46.280
one way to find the domain and range are to graph the function. But it's often possible to find the

02:58:46.280 --> 02:58:52.280
domain at least more quickly by using algebraic considerations. We think about what x values

02:58:52.280 --> 02:58:57.480
it makes sense to plug into this expression, and what x values need to be excluded because they

02:58:57.480 --> 02:59:03.320
make the algebraic expression impossible to evaluate. Specifically, to find the domain of a function,

02:59:04.280 --> 02:59:11.960
we need to exclude x values that make the denominator zero since we can't divide by zero.

02:59:13.160 --> 02:59:20.760
We also need to exclude x values that make an expression inside a square root sign negative

02:59:20.760 --> 02:59:25.800
since we can't take the square root of a negative number. In fact, we need to exclude values that

02:59:25.800 --> 02:59:32.200
make expression inside any even root negative because we can't take an even root of a negative

02:59:32.200 --> 02:59:37.480
number even though we can take an odd root like a cube root of a negative number. Later,

02:59:37.480 --> 02:59:42.040
when we look at logarithmic functions, we'll have some additional exclusions that we have to make.

02:59:42.040 --> 02:59:47.880
But for now, these two principles should handle all functions we'll see. So let's apply them to

02:59:47.880 --> 02:59:54.760
a couple examples. For the function in part a, we don't have any square root signs, but we do have

02:59:54.760 --> 03:00:01.000
a denominator. So we need to exclude x values that make the denominator zero. In other words,

03:00:01.000 --> 03:00:10.760
we need x squared minus 4x plus three to not be equal to zero. If we solve x squared minus 4x plus

03:00:10.760 --> 03:00:19.000
three equal to zero, we can do that by factoring. And that gives us x equals three or x equals one.

03:00:19.000 --> 03:00:25.960
So we need to exclude these values. All other x values should be fine. So if I draw the number line,

03:00:25.960 --> 03:00:33.480
I can put on one and three and just dig out a hole at both of those. And my domain includes

03:00:33.480 --> 03:00:39.720
everything else on the number line. In interval notation, this means my domain is everything

03:00:39.720 --> 03:00:45.960
from negative infinity to one together with everything from one to three together with

03:00:45.960 --> 03:00:52.040
everything from three to infinity. In this second example, we don't have any

03:00:52.040 --> 03:00:59.240
denominators to worry about, but we do have a square root sign. So we need to exclude any x values

03:00:59.240 --> 03:01:07.320
that make three minus 2x less than zero. In other words, we can include all x values for which three

03:01:07.320 --> 03:01:13.640
minus 2x is greater than or equal to zero. Solving that inequality gives us three is greater than

03:01:13.640 --> 03:01:22.600
or equal to 2x. In other words, x is less than or equal to three halves. I can draw this on the

03:01:22.600 --> 03:01:31.080
number line or write it in interval notation. Notice that three halves is included. And that's

03:01:31.080 --> 03:01:37.400
because three minus 2x is allowed to be zero, I can take the square root of zero, it's just zero.

03:01:37.400 --> 03:01:42.840
And that's not a problem. Finally, let's look at a more complicated function that involves

03:01:42.840 --> 03:01:47.080
both a square root and a denominator. Now there are two things I need to worry about.

03:01:48.440 --> 03:01:57.240
I need the denominator to not be equal to zero. And I need the stuff inside the square root sign

03:01:57.240 --> 03:02:02.760
to be greater than or equal to zero. From our earlier work, we know that the first condition

03:02:02.760 --> 03:02:09.160
means that x is not equal to three, and x is not equal to one. And the second condition

03:02:09.160 --> 03:02:14.920
means that x is less than or equal to three halves. Let's draw both of those conditions

03:02:14.920 --> 03:02:22.600
on the number line. x is not equal to three and x is not equal to one means we've got everything

03:02:23.640 --> 03:02:29.880
except those two dug out points. And the other condition x is less than or equal to three halves

03:02:29.880 --> 03:02:36.600
means we can have three halves and everything to the left of it. Now to be in our domain and to

03:02:36.600 --> 03:02:41.080
be legit for our function, we need both of these conditions to be true. So I'm going to connect

03:02:41.080 --> 03:02:46.200
these conditions with an and. And that means we're looking for numbers on the number line that are

03:02:46.200 --> 03:02:53.240
colored both red and blue. So I'll draw that above in purple. So that's everything from three halves

03:02:53.240 --> 03:02:58.520
to one. I have to dig out one because one was a problem for the denominator. And then I can

03:02:58.520 --> 03:03:04.840
continue for all the things that are colored both both colors red and blue. So my final domain

03:03:04.840 --> 03:03:11.560
is going to be let's see negative infinity up to but not including one together with

03:03:12.440 --> 03:03:18.040
one but not including it to three halves and I include three halves since that was colored

03:03:18.040 --> 03:03:24.040
both red and blue also. In this video, we talked about functions, how to evaluate them, and how

03:03:24.040 --> 03:03:30.520
to find domains and ranges. This video gives the graphs of some commonly used functions that I call

03:03:30.520 --> 03:03:37.400
the toolkit functions. The first function is the function y equals x. Let's plot a few points on

03:03:37.400 --> 03:03:47.480
the graph of this function. If x is zero, y is zero. If x is one, y is one. And so on y is always

03:03:47.480 --> 03:03:53.400
equal to x doesn't have to just be an integer, it can be any real number. And while connecting the

03:03:53.400 --> 03:04:00.040
dots, we get a straight line through the origin. Let's look at the graph of y equals x squared.

03:04:00.680 --> 03:04:07.400
If x is zero, y is zero. So we go through the origin again. If x is one, y is one.

03:04:08.520 --> 03:04:17.080
And if x is negative one, y is also one. The x value of two gives a y value of four and the x

03:04:17.080 --> 03:04:23.720
value of negative two gives a y value of four also. Connecting the dots, we get a parabola.

03:04:24.520 --> 03:04:34.120
Notice that this function is an even function. That means it has mirror symmetry across the y

03:04:34.120 --> 03:04:40.360
axis, the left side looks like exactly like the mirror image of the right side. That happens because

03:04:40.360 --> 03:04:45.880
when you square a positive number like two, you get the exact same y value as when you

03:04:46.600 --> 03:04:54.760
square its mirror image x value of negative two. The next function y equals x cubed. I'll call that

03:04:54.760 --> 03:05:02.760
a cubic. Let's plot a few points when x is zero, y is zero. When x is one, y is one. When x is

03:05:02.760 --> 03:05:10.360
negative one, y is negative one. Two goes with the point eight way up here and an x value of negative

03:05:10.360 --> 03:05:16.440
two is going to give us negative eight. If I connect the dots, I get something that looks kind of like

03:05:16.440 --> 03:05:26.360
this. This function is what's called an odd function, because it has 180 degree rotational

03:05:26.360 --> 03:05:31.960
symmetry around the origin. If I rotate this whole graph by 180 degrees, or in other words,

03:05:31.960 --> 03:05:38.840
turn the paper upside down, I'll get exactly the same shape. The reason this function has this odd

03:05:38.840 --> 03:05:46.840
symmetry is because when I cube a positive number and get its y value, I get and cube the

03:05:46.840 --> 03:05:52.520
corresponding negative number to get its y value, the negative number cubed gives us exactly the

03:05:52.520 --> 03:06:00.200
negative of the y value we get with cubing the positive number. Let's look at the next example,

03:06:00.200 --> 03:06:09.480
y equals a square root of x. Notice that the domain of this function is just x values bigger

03:06:09.480 --> 03:06:14.280
than or equal to zero because we can't take the square root of a negative number. Let's plug in

03:06:14.280 --> 03:06:21.960
a few x values, x is zero gives y is zero, x is one, square root of one is one, square root of four is

03:06:21.960 --> 03:06:26.280
two. And connecting the dots, I get a function that looks like this.

03:06:28.760 --> 03:06:33.240
The absolute value function is next. Again, if we plug in a few points,

03:06:34.440 --> 03:06:41.960
x is zero goes with y equals zero, x is one gives us one, the absolute value of negative one is one.

03:06:43.640 --> 03:06:49.800
Two two is on the graph and the absolute value of negative two is two. I'm ending up getting

03:06:50.520 --> 03:06:55.880
a v shaped graph. It also has even or mirror symmetry.

03:06:57.800 --> 03:07:04.280
Y equals two to the x is what's known as an exponential function. That's because the variable x

03:07:04.280 --> 03:07:17.240
is in the exponent. If I plot a few points, two to the zero is one, two to the one is two,

03:07:17.240 --> 03:07:23.960
two squared is four, two to the minus one is one half. I'll plot these on my graph.

03:07:24.760 --> 03:07:31.240
Let me fill in a few more points. So let's see, two cubed is eight, that's way up here.

03:07:31.880 --> 03:07:38.200
And negative two gives me one fourth, one eighth. Connecting the dots, I get something that's shaped

03:07:38.200 --> 03:07:44.760
like this. You might have heard the expression exponential growth when talking about, for example,

03:07:44.760 --> 03:07:52.360
population growth. This is function is represents exponential growth. It grows very, very steeply.

03:07:52.360 --> 03:07:57.640
Every time we increase the x coordinate by one, we double the y coordinate.

03:08:00.040 --> 03:08:06.600
We could also look at a function like y equals three to the x or sometimes y equals e to the x,

03:08:06.600 --> 03:08:13.560
where e is just a number about 2.7. These functions look very similar. It's just the

03:08:13.560 --> 03:08:21.800
bigger base makes us rise a little more steeply. Now let's look at the function y equals one over x.

03:08:22.760 --> 03:08:29.640
It's not defined when x is zero. But I can plug in x equals one half, one over one half is two.

03:08:31.480 --> 03:08:39.400
One over one is one. And one over two is one half. If I connect the dots, I get this shape

03:08:39.960 --> 03:08:45.240
in the first quadrant, but I haven't looked at negative values of x. When x is negative, one over

03:08:45.240 --> 03:08:52.680
negative one is negative one. One over negative a half is negative two. And I get a similar looking

03:08:52.680 --> 03:09:03.640
piece in the third quadrant. This is an example of a hyperbola. And it's also an odd function,

03:09:03.640 --> 03:09:09.560
because it has that 180 degree rotational symmetry. If I turn the page upside down,

03:09:09.560 --> 03:09:15.000
it'll look exactly the same. Finally, let's look at y equals one over x squared.

03:09:16.200 --> 03:09:19.960
Again, it's not defined when x is zero, but I can plug in points like

03:09:20.840 --> 03:09:27.880
one half for x. Let's see one over one half squared is one over one fourth, which is four.

03:09:28.520 --> 03:09:36.120
And one over one squared, one over two squared is a fourth. It looks pretty much like the previous

03:09:36.120 --> 03:09:41.080
function. It's just a little bit more extreme rises a little more steeply, falls a little more

03:09:41.080 --> 03:09:46.120
dramatically. But for negative values of x, something a little bit different goes on. For

03:09:46.120 --> 03:09:53.400
example, one over negative two squared is just one over four, which is a fourth. So I can plot

03:09:53.400 --> 03:10:01.720
so I can plot that point there. And one over negative one squared, that's just one. So my

03:10:01.720 --> 03:10:06.680
curve for negative values of x is going to lie in the second quadrant, not the third quadrant.

03:10:07.400 --> 03:10:15.560
This is an example of an even function, because it has perfect mirror symmetry across the y axis.

03:10:16.920 --> 03:10:21.800
These are the toolkit functions. And I recommend you memorize the shape of each of them.

03:10:22.520 --> 03:10:28.280
That way you can draw at least a rough sketch very quickly without having to plug in points.

03:10:29.400 --> 03:10:31.960
That's all for the graphs of the toolkit functions.

03:10:34.200 --> 03:10:40.440
If we change the equation of a function, then the graph of the function changes or transforms

03:10:40.440 --> 03:10:46.520
in predictable ways. This video gives some rules and examples for transformations of functions.

03:10:47.160 --> 03:10:51.400
To get the most out of this video, it's helpful if you're already familiar with the graph of

03:10:51.400 --> 03:10:57.000
some typical functions, I call them toolkit functions, like y equals square root of x,

03:10:57.000 --> 03:11:03.000
y equals x squared, y equals the absolute value of x, and so on. If you're not familiar with those

03:11:03.000 --> 03:11:08.840
graphs, I encourage you to watch my video called toolkit functions first before watching this one.

03:11:10.200 --> 03:11:16.440
I want to start by reviewing function notation. If g of x represents the function the square root of

03:11:16.440 --> 03:11:24.360
x, then we can rewrite these expressions in terms of square roots. For example, g of x minus two

03:11:24.920 --> 03:11:28.040
is the same thing as the square root of x minus two.

03:11:30.280 --> 03:11:38.120
g of quantity x minus two means we plug in x minus two everywhere we see an x.

03:11:38.840 --> 03:11:44.120
So that would be the same thing as the square root of quantity x minus two.

03:11:44.120 --> 03:11:50.280
In this second example, I say that we're subtracting two on the inside of the function,

03:11:50.280 --> 03:11:55.320
because we're subtracting two before we apply the square root function. Whereas on the first

03:11:55.320 --> 03:12:00.520
example, I say that the minus two is on the outside of the function. We're doing the square root

03:12:00.520 --> 03:12:06.760
function first and then subtracting two. In this third example, g of three x, we're multiplying

03:12:06.760 --> 03:12:12.840
by three on the inside of the function. To evaluate this in terms of square root, we plug in the entire

03:12:12.840 --> 03:12:18.760
three x for x and the square root function. That gives us the square root of three x.

03:12:20.120 --> 03:12:23.720
In the next example, we're multiplying by three on the outside of the function.

03:12:24.760 --> 03:12:32.280
This is just three times the square root of x. Finally, g of minus x means the square root of

03:12:32.280 --> 03:12:37.320
minus x. This might look a little odd because we're not used to taking the square root of a

03:12:37.320 --> 03:12:43.320
negative number. But remember that if x itself is negative, like negative two, then negative x will

03:12:43.320 --> 03:12:47.960
be negative negative two or positive two. So we'll really be taking the square root of a positive

03:12:47.960 --> 03:12:53.480
number in that case. Let me record which of these are inside and which of these are outside of my

03:12:53.480 --> 03:12:59.640
function. In this next set of examples, we're using the same function g of x is square root of x.

03:12:59.640 --> 03:13:03.800
But this time we're starting with an expression with square roots in it and trying to write it

03:13:03.800 --> 03:13:11.000
in terms of g of x. So the first example, the plus 17 is on the outside of my function,

03:13:11.000 --> 03:13:18.120
because I'm taking the square root of x first and then adding 17. So I can write this as g of x

03:13:18.120 --> 03:13:26.920
plus 17. In the second example, I'm taking x and adding 12 first, then I take the square root of the

03:13:26.920 --> 03:13:32.280
whole thing. Since I'm adding the 12 to x first, that's on the inside of my function. So I write

03:13:32.280 --> 03:13:40.840
that as g of the quantity x plus 12. Remember that this notation means I plug in the entire x plus

03:13:40.840 --> 03:13:47.000
12 into the square root sign, which gives me exactly square root of x plus 12. In this next

03:13:47.000 --> 03:13:52.920
example, I'm doing the square root first and then multiplying by negative 36. So my minus 36

03:13:52.920 --> 03:14:00.600
multiplication is outside my function. I can rewrite this as minus 36 times g of x. Finally,

03:14:00.600 --> 03:14:06.120
in this last example, I take x multiply by a fourth and then apply the square root of x.

03:14:06.120 --> 03:14:13.000
So that's the same thing as g of one fourth x, my one fourth x is on the inside of my function.

03:14:13.560 --> 03:14:17.320
In other words, it's inside the parentheses when I use function notation.

03:14:19.160 --> 03:14:22.920
Let's graph the square root of x and two transformations of this function.

03:14:22.920 --> 03:14:29.160
y equals the square root of x goes through the points zero zero one one and four two,

03:14:29.160 --> 03:14:32.600
since the square root of four is two, and looks something like this.

03:14:34.520 --> 03:14:40.120
In order to graph y equals the square root of x minus two, notice that the minus two is on the

03:14:40.120 --> 03:14:44.920
outside of the function. That means we're going to take the square root of x first and then subtract

03:14:44.920 --> 03:14:51.400
two. So for example, if we start with the x value of zero and compute the square root of zero, that's

03:14:52.200 --> 03:14:55.720
then we subtract two to give us a y value of negative two.

03:14:56.920 --> 03:15:03.560
An x value of one, which under the square root function had a y value of one, now has a y value

03:15:03.560 --> 03:15:11.640
that's decreased by two, one minus two is negative one. And finally, an x value of four, which under

03:15:11.640 --> 03:15:18.040
the square root function had a y value of two, now has a y value of two minus two or zero. Its y

03:15:18.040 --> 03:15:25.960
value was also decreased by two. If I plot these new points, zero goes with negative two, one goes

03:15:25.960 --> 03:15:34.600
with negative one, and four goes with zero, I have my transformed graph. Because I subtracted two on

03:15:34.600 --> 03:15:41.720
the outside of my function, my y values were decreased by two, which brought my graph down by two units.

03:15:42.680 --> 03:15:49.080
Next, let's look at y equals the square root of quantity x minus two. Now we're subtracting two on

03:15:49.080 --> 03:15:53.320
the inside of our function, which means we subtract two from x first and then take the square root.

03:15:53.960 --> 03:16:00.840
In order to get the same y value of zero as we had in our blue graph, we need our x minus two to be

03:16:00.840 --> 03:16:07.800
zero. So we need our original x to be two. In order to get the y value of one that we had in our blue

03:16:08.040 --> 03:16:14.520
graph, we need to be taking the square root of one. So we need x minus two to be one, which means

03:16:14.520 --> 03:16:21.240
that we need to start with an x value of three. And in order to reproduce our y value of two from

03:16:21.240 --> 03:16:27.800
our original graph, we need the square root of x minus two to be two, which means we need to start

03:16:27.800 --> 03:16:35.000
out by taking the square root of four, which means our x minus two is four. So our x should be up

03:16:35.000 --> 03:16:43.080
there at six. If I plot my x values with my corresponding y values of square root of x minus

03:16:43.080 --> 03:16:50.360
two, I get the following graph. Notice that the graph has moved horizontally to the right by two

03:16:50.360 --> 03:16:58.360
units. To me, moving down by two units makes sense because we're subtracting two. So we're

03:16:58.360 --> 03:17:03.960
decreasing y's by two units. But the minus two on the inside, that kind of does the opposite of what

03:17:03.960 --> 03:17:09.640
I expect. I might expect it to move the graph left. I might expect the x values to be going

03:17:09.640 --> 03:17:16.680
down by two units. But instead, it moves the graph to the right. Because the x units have to go up by

03:17:16.680 --> 03:17:21.880
two units in order to get the right square root when I then subtract two units again.

03:17:22.680 --> 03:17:25.640
The observations we made for these transformations of functions

03:17:26.360 --> 03:17:33.080
hold in general, according to the following rules. First of all, numbers on the outside of the function,

03:17:33.080 --> 03:17:39.560
like in our example, y equals the square root of x minus two. Those numbers affect the y values

03:17:39.560 --> 03:17:45.560
and result in vertical motions, like we saw. These motions are in the direction you expect. So

03:17:45.560 --> 03:17:51.720
subtracting two moves just down by two. If we were adding two instead, that would move us up by two.

03:17:53.000 --> 03:17:58.440
Numbers on the inside of the function, that's like our example, y equals the square root of

03:17:58.440 --> 03:18:04.040
quantity x minus two, those affect the x values and results in a horizontal motion.

03:18:04.600 --> 03:18:09.720
These motions go in the opposite direction from what you expect. Remember, the minus two on the

03:18:09.720 --> 03:18:15.640
inside actually shifted our graph to the right. If it had had a plus two on the inside, that would

03:18:15.640 --> 03:18:23.080
actually shift our graph to the left. Adding results in a shift, those are called translations,

03:18:23.080 --> 03:18:29.880
but multiplying, like something like y equals three times the square root of x, that would result

03:18:29.880 --> 03:18:35.560
in a stretch or shrink. In other words, if I start with the square root of x,

03:18:37.000 --> 03:18:42.040
and then want to graph y equals three times the square root of x, that stretches my graph

03:18:42.040 --> 03:18:50.680
vertically by a factor of three, like this. If I want to graph y equals one third times the

03:18:50.680 --> 03:18:58.600
square root of x, that shrinks my graph vertically by a factor of one third. Finally, a negative sign

03:18:58.600 --> 03:19:04.120
results in reflection. For example, if I start with a graph of y equals a square root of x,

03:19:05.240 --> 03:19:11.240
and then want to graph y equals the square root of negative x, that's going to do a reflection

03:19:11.240 --> 03:19:15.080
in the horizontal direction because the negative is on the inside of the square root sign.

03:19:15.080 --> 03:19:20.760
A reflection in the horizontal direction means a reflection across the y axis.

03:19:22.520 --> 03:19:27.960
If instead I want to graph y equals negative the square root of x, that negative sign on the outside

03:19:27.960 --> 03:19:36.680
means a vertical reflection, a reflection across the x axis. Pause the video for a moment and see

03:19:36.680 --> 03:19:42.520
if you can describe what happens in these four transformations. In the first example, we're

03:19:42.520 --> 03:19:48.200
subtracting four on the outside of the function. Adding and subtracting means a translation or

03:19:48.200 --> 03:19:53.480
shift, and since we're on the outside of the function, it affects the y values, that's moving

03:19:53.480 --> 03:20:00.840
us vertically. So this transformation should take the square root of graph and move it down

03:20:00.840 --> 03:20:09.240
by four units. That would look something like this. In the next example, we're adding 12 on the

03:20:09.240 --> 03:20:15.560
inside. That's still a translation, but now we're moving horizontally. And so since we go

03:20:15.560 --> 03:20:21.640
the opposite direction we expect, we are going to go to the left by 12 units. That's going to look

03:20:21.640 --> 03:20:27.880
something like this. In the next example, we're multiplying by three and introducing a negative

03:20:27.880 --> 03:20:33.960
sign, both on the outside of our function. Outside our function means we're affecting the y values.

03:20:33.960 --> 03:20:40.920
So and multiplication means we're stretching by a factor of three. The negative sign means we reflect

03:20:40.920 --> 03:20:47.080
in the vertical direction. Here's stretching by a factor of three vertically before I apply the

03:20:47.080 --> 03:20:54.760
minus sign. And now the minus sign reflects in the vertical direction. Finally, in this last

03:20:54.760 --> 03:21:00.600
example, we're multiplying by one quarter on the inside of our function. We know that multiplication

03:21:00.600 --> 03:21:07.160
means stretch or shrink. And since we're on the inside, it's a horizontal motion. And it does the

03:21:07.160 --> 03:21:12.680
opposite of what we expect. So instead of shrinking by a factor of one fourth horizontally, it's

03:21:12.680 --> 03:21:19.240
actually going to stretch by the reciprocal, a factor of four horizontally. That'll look something

03:21:19.240 --> 03:21:25.800
like this. Notice that stretching horizontally by a factor of four looks kind of like shrinking

03:21:25.800 --> 03:21:31.960
vertically by a factor of one half. And that's actually borne out by the algebra, because the

03:21:31.960 --> 03:21:36.840
square root of one fourth x is the same thing as the square root of one fourth times the square root

03:21:36.840 --> 03:21:44.280
of x, which is the same thing as one half times the square root of x. And so now we can see algebraically

03:21:44.280 --> 03:21:50.920
that a vertical shrink by a factor of one half is the same as a horizontal stretch by a factor of

03:21:50.920 --> 03:21:57.080
four, at least for this function, the square root function. This video gave some rules for

03:21:57.080 --> 03:22:05.080
transformations of functions, which I'll repeat below. Numbers on the outside correspond to changes

03:22:05.080 --> 03:22:13.720
in the y values, or vertical motions. Numbers on the inside of the function affect the x values

03:22:14.280 --> 03:22:23.160
and result in horizontal motions. Adding and subtracting corresponds to translations or shifts.

03:22:24.840 --> 03:22:32.440
Multiplying and dividing by numbers corresponds to stretches and shrinks. And putting in a negative

03:22:32.440 --> 03:22:41.880
sign corresponds to a reflection. A horizontal reflection, if the negative sign is on the inside

03:22:41.880 --> 03:22:47.720
and a vertical reflection, if the negative sign is on the outside. Knowing these basic rules about

03:22:47.720 --> 03:22:52.840
transformations empowers you to be able to sketch graphs of much more complicated functions,

03:22:53.880 --> 03:22:59.320
like y equals three times the square root of x plus two, by simply considering the transformations

03:23:00.440 --> 03:23:07.720
one at a time. A quadratic function is a function that can be written in the form f of x equals

03:23:07.800 --> 03:23:18.920
ax squared plus bx plus c, where a, b, and c are real numbers. And a is not equal to zero.

03:23:19.640 --> 03:23:26.200
The reason we require that a is not equal to zero is because if a were equal to zero,

03:23:26.200 --> 03:23:32.520
we'd have f of x is equal to bx plus c, which is called a linear function.

03:23:33.480 --> 03:23:38.600
So by making sure that a is not zero, we make sure there's really an x squared term,

03:23:38.600 --> 03:23:44.440
which is the hallmark of a quadratic function. Please pause the video for a moment and decide

03:23:44.440 --> 03:23:51.000
which of these equations represent quadratic functions. The first function can definitely

03:23:51.000 --> 03:23:59.320
be written in the form g of x equals ax squared plus bx plus c, in fact it's already written in

03:23:59.320 --> 03:24:08.360
that form, where a is negative five, b is 10, and c is three. The second equation is also a

03:24:08.360 --> 03:24:16.760
quadratic function, because we can think of it as f of x equals one times x squared plus zero times

03:24:16.760 --> 03:24:27.240
x plus zero. So it is in the right form, where a is one, b is zero, and c is zero. It's perfectly

03:24:27.240 --> 03:24:33.400
fine for the coefficient of x and the constant term to be zero for a quadratic function. We

03:24:33.400 --> 03:24:37.880
just need the coefficient of x squared to be nonzero, so the x squared term is preserved.

03:24:39.480 --> 03:24:46.680
The third equation is not a quadratic function. It's a linear function, because there's no x

03:24:46.680 --> 03:24:55.240
squared term. The fourth function might not look like a quadratic function, but if we rewrite it

03:24:55.240 --> 03:25:02.280
by expanding out the x minus three squared, let's see what happens. We get y equals two times x

03:25:02.280 --> 03:25:10.840
minus three times x minus three plus four. So that's two times x squared minus three x minus three x

03:25:10.840 --> 03:25:23.160
plus nine plus four. Continuing, I get two x squared minus 12 x's plus 18 plus four. In other

03:25:23.160 --> 03:25:31.000
words, y equals two x squared minus 12 x plus 22. So in fact, our function can be written in the right

03:25:31.000 --> 03:25:39.240
form, and it is a quadratic function. A function that is already written in the form y equals a x

03:25:39.240 --> 03:25:49.080
squared plus b x plus c is said to be in standard form. So our first example g of x is in standard

03:25:49.080 --> 03:25:57.240
form. A function that's written in the format of the last function, that is, in the form of y equals

03:25:57.240 --> 03:26:07.880
a times x minus h squared plus k for some numbers a, h, and k, that's said to be in vertex form.

03:26:09.000 --> 03:26:13.080
I'll talk more about standard form and vertex form in another video.

03:26:13.640 --> 03:26:18.920
In this video, we identified some quadratic functions and talked about the difference between

03:26:18.920 --> 03:26:31.080
standard form and vertex form. This video is about graphing quadratic functions. A quadratic function,

03:26:31.080 --> 03:26:40.120
which is typically written in standard form, like this, or sometimes in vertex form, like this, always

03:26:40.680 --> 03:26:47.320
has the graph that looks like a parabola. This video will show how to tell whether the parabola is

03:26:47.320 --> 03:26:58.280
pointing up or down, how to find its x-intercepts, and how to find its vertex. The bare bones basic

03:26:58.280 --> 03:27:06.600
quadratic function is f of x equals x squared. It goes to the origin since f of zero is zero

03:27:06.600 --> 03:27:15.960
squared, which is zero, and it is a parabola pointing upwards like this. The vertex of a parabola

03:27:15.960 --> 03:27:21.480
is its lowest point if it's pointing upwards, and its highest point if it's pointing downwards.

03:27:22.520 --> 03:27:29.800
So in this case, the vertex is at zero zero. The x-intercepts are where the graph crosses the

03:27:29.880 --> 03:27:37.000
x-axis, in other words, where y is zero. And in this function, y equals zero means that x squared is

03:27:37.000 --> 03:27:43.800
zero, which happens only when x is zero. So the x-intercept, there's only one of them, is also zero.

03:27:45.000 --> 03:27:50.200
This second function, y equals negative three x squared, also goes through the origin,

03:27:50.840 --> 03:27:58.120
since the function's value when x is zero is y equals zero. But in this case, the parabola is

03:27:58.120 --> 03:28:04.840
pointing downwards. That's because thinking about transformations of functions, a negative sign on

03:28:04.840 --> 03:28:11.800
the outside reflects the function vertically over the x-axis, making the parabola instead of pointing

03:28:11.800 --> 03:28:20.040
upwards, reflecting the point downwards. The number three on the outside stretches the graph

03:28:20.040 --> 03:28:25.560
vertically by a factor of three, so it makes it kind of long and skinny, like this.

03:28:28.520 --> 03:28:33.720
In general, a negative coefficient to the x squared term means the parabola will be pointing

03:28:33.720 --> 03:28:39.080
down, whereas a positive coefficient, like here the coefficient's one, means the parabola's pointing

03:28:39.080 --> 03:28:47.640
up. I'll write that rule over here. So if a is bigger than zero, the parabola opens up,

03:28:49.160 --> 03:28:54.120
and if the value of the coefficient a is less than zero, then the parabola opens down.

03:28:54.120 --> 03:29:01.320
In this second example, we can see again that the vertex is at zero zero, and the x intercept is x

03:29:01.320 --> 03:29:09.480
equals zero. Let's look at this third example. If we multiplied our expression out, we'd see

03:29:09.480 --> 03:29:15.320
that the coefficient of x squared would be two, a positive number. So that means our parabola is

03:29:15.320 --> 03:29:22.360
going to be opening up. But the vertex of this parabola will no longer be at the origin. In fact,

03:29:22.360 --> 03:29:26.920
we can find the parabola's vertex by thinking about transformations of functions.

03:29:28.440 --> 03:29:36.600
Our function is related to the function y equals two x squared by moving it to the right by three

03:29:36.600 --> 03:29:47.480
and up by four. Since y equals two x squared has a vertex at zero zero, if we move that whole

03:29:47.480 --> 03:29:56.920
parabola, including the vertex right by three, and up by four, the vertex will end up at the point

03:29:56.920 --> 03:30:07.080
three, four. So a parabola will look something like this. Notice how easy it was to just read

03:30:07.080 --> 03:30:13.720
off the vertex when our quadratic function is written in this form. In fact, any parabola,

03:30:13.720 --> 03:30:20.520
any quadratic function written in the form a times x minus h squared plus k has a vertex

03:30:21.240 --> 03:30:28.520
at hk. By the same reasoning, we're moving the parabola with a vertex at the origin

03:30:28.520 --> 03:30:36.440
to the right by h and up by k. That's why this form of a quadratic function is called the vertex

03:30:36.440 --> 03:30:44.680
form. Notice that this parabola has no x intercepts because it does not cross the x axis.

03:30:45.960 --> 03:30:50.840
For our final function, we have g of x equals five x squared plus 10x plus three.

03:30:52.280 --> 03:30:56.920
We know the graph of this function will be a parabola pointing upwards because the coefficient

03:30:56.920 --> 03:31:05.480
of x squared is positive. To find the x intercepts, we can set y equals zero. Since the x intercepts

03:31:05.480 --> 03:31:13.400
is where our graph crosses the x axis, and that's where the y value is zero. So zero equals five x

03:31:13.400 --> 03:31:19.080
squared plus 10x plus three, I'm going to use the quadratic formula to solve that. So x is

03:31:19.080 --> 03:31:26.840
negative 10 plus or minus the square root of 10 squared minus four times five times three,

03:31:26.840 --> 03:31:33.880
all over two times five. That simplifies to x equals negative 10 plus or minus the square root

03:31:33.880 --> 03:31:42.120
of 40 over 10, which simplifies further to x equals negative 10 over 10 plus or minus the

03:31:42.120 --> 03:31:49.400
square root of 40 over 10, which is negative one plus or minus two square root of 10 over 10,

03:31:49.400 --> 03:31:56.040
or negative one plus or minus square root of 10 over five. Since the square root of 10 is just a

03:31:56.040 --> 03:32:03.800
little bit bigger than three, this works out to approximately about negative two-fifths and

03:32:03.800 --> 03:32:10.120
negative eight-fifths. So somewhere around right here. So our parabola is going to look something

03:32:10.120 --> 03:32:17.480
like this. Notice that it goes through, crosses the x axis at y equals three. That's because when

03:32:17.480 --> 03:32:25.960
we plug in x equals zero into here, we get y equals three. So the y intercept is at three.

03:32:26.760 --> 03:32:35.800
Finally, we can find the vertex. Since this function is written in standard form, the y equals

03:32:35.800 --> 03:32:44.760
ax plus x squared plus bx plus c form, and not in vertex form, we can't just read off the vertex

03:32:44.760 --> 03:32:50.200
like we could before. But there's a trick called the vertex formula, which says that whenever you

03:32:50.200 --> 03:32:57.480
have a function in a quadratic function in standard form, the vertex has an x coordinate

03:32:59.000 --> 03:33:08.440
of negative b over 2a. So in this case, that's an x coordinate of negative 10 over two times five

03:33:08.440 --> 03:33:14.040
or negative one, which is kind of like where I put it on the graph. To find the y coordinate

03:33:14.040 --> 03:33:23.800
of that vertex, I can just plug in negative one into my equation for x, which gives me y equals

03:33:23.800 --> 03:33:31.320
five times negative one squared plus 10 times negative one plus three, which is negative two.

03:33:32.600 --> 03:33:37.000
So I think I better redraw my graph a little bit to put that vertex down at

03:33:37.000 --> 03:33:39.720
a y coordinate of negative two, where it's supposed to be.

03:33:43.960 --> 03:33:48.920
Let's summarize the steps we use to graph these quadratic functions. First of all,

03:33:48.920 --> 03:33:52.520
the graph of a quadratic function has the shape of a parabola.

03:33:55.480 --> 03:34:01.480
The parabola opens up if the coefficient of x squared, which we call a is greater than zero,

03:34:01.480 --> 03:34:09.000
and down if a is less than zero. To find the x intercepts, we set y equal to zero,

03:34:09.000 --> 03:34:18.600
or in other words, f of x equal to zero, and solve for x. To find the vertex, we can either read it

03:34:18.600 --> 03:34:29.560
off as hk if our function is in vertex form, or we can use the vertex formula

03:34:31.480 --> 03:34:41.400
and get the x coordinate of the vertex to be negative b over two a, if our function is in

03:34:41.400 --> 03:34:50.920
standard form. To find the y coordinate of the vertex in this case, we just plug in the x coordinate

03:34:52.600 --> 03:34:59.560
and figure out what y is. Finally, we can always find additional points on the graph by plugging in

03:35:00.200 --> 03:35:07.080
values of x. In this video, we learned some tricks for graphing quadratic functions.

03:35:08.040 --> 03:35:15.960
In particular, we saw that the vertex can be read off as hk if our function is written

03:35:15.960 --> 03:35:20.920
in vertex form, and the x coordinate of the vertex can be calculated

03:35:23.480 --> 03:35:30.920
as negative b over two a if our function is in standard form. For an explanation of why this

03:35:30.920 --> 03:35:38.840
vertex formula works, please see it in my other video. A quadratic in standard form looks like

03:35:38.840 --> 03:35:46.280
y equals ax squared plus bx plus c, where a, b, and c are real numbers, and a is not zero.

03:35:47.320 --> 03:35:54.840
A quadratic function in vertex form looks like y equals a times x minus h squared plus k,

03:35:54.840 --> 03:36:01.000
where a, h, and k are real numbers, and a is not zero. When a function is in vertex form,

03:36:01.000 --> 03:36:09.080
it's easy to read off the vertex. It's just the ordered pair hk. This video explains how to get

03:36:09.080 --> 03:36:16.520
from vertex form to standard form and vice versa. Let's start by converting this quadratic function

03:36:16.520 --> 03:36:22.680
from vertex form to standard form. That's pretty straightforward. We just have to distribute out.

03:36:24.840 --> 03:36:29.480
So if I multiply out the x minus three squared,

03:36:31.880 --> 03:36:41.000
I get minus four times x squared minus six x plus nine plus one, distributing the negative four,

03:36:41.000 --> 03:36:50.360
I get negative four x squared plus 24x minus 36 plus one. So that works out to minus four x squared

03:36:50.360 --> 03:36:58.280
plus 24x minus 35. And I have my quadratic function now in standard form.

03:36:59.880 --> 03:37:05.240
Now let's go the other direction and convert a quadratic function that's already in standard form

03:37:05.800 --> 03:37:16.040
into vertex form. That is, we want to put it in the form of g of x equals a times x minus h squared

03:37:16.040 --> 03:37:25.400
plus k, where the vertex is at hk. To do this, it's handy to use the vertex formula.

03:37:27.000 --> 03:37:34.680
The vertex formula says that the x coordinate of the vertex is given by negative b over two a,

03:37:35.320 --> 03:37:43.160
where a is the coefficient of x squared, and b is the coefficient of x. So in this case,

03:37:43.160 --> 03:37:48.840
we get an x coordinate of negative eight over two times two or negative two.

03:37:49.800 --> 03:37:57.880
To find the y coordinate of the vertex, we just plug in the x coordinate into our formula for g

03:37:57.880 --> 03:38:05.240
of x. So that's g of negative two, which is two times negative two squared plus eight times negative

03:38:05.240 --> 03:38:13.560
two plus six. And that works out to be negative two by coincidence. So the vertex for our quadratic

03:38:13.560 --> 03:38:19.960
function has coordinates negative two, negative two. And if I want to write g of x in vertex form,

03:38:19.960 --> 03:38:28.440
it's going to be a times x minus negative two squared plus minus two. That's because

03:38:29.240 --> 03:38:38.600
remember, we subtract h and we add k. So that simplifies to g of x equals a times x plus two

03:38:38.600 --> 03:38:44.520
squared minus two. And finally, we just need to figure out what this leading coefficient a is.

03:38:45.080 --> 03:38:52.840
But notice if we were to multiply distribute this out, then the coefficient of x squared would end

03:38:52.920 --> 03:38:59.080
up being a. So therefore, the coefficient of x squared here, which is a has to be the same as

03:38:59.080 --> 03:39:04.440
the coefficient of x squared here, which we conveniently also call a. In other words, our a down

03:39:04.440 --> 03:39:11.560
here needs to be two. So I'm going to write that as g of x equals two times x plus two squared

03:39:11.560 --> 03:39:18.920
minus two, lots of twos in this problem. And that's our quadratic function in vertex form.

03:39:18.920 --> 03:39:22.840
If I want to check my answer, of course, I could just distribute out again, I'd get

03:39:24.200 --> 03:39:34.200
two times x squared plus four x plus two minus two. In other words, two x squared plus eight x

03:39:34.200 --> 03:39:40.360
plus six, which checks out to exactly what I started with. This video showed how to get from

03:39:40.360 --> 03:39:46.920
vertex form to standard form by distributing out and how to get from standard form to vertex form

03:39:47.000 --> 03:39:49.720
by finding the vertex using the vertex formula.

03:39:51.880 --> 03:39:58.520
Suppose you have a quadratic function in the form y equals a x squared plus b x plus c,

03:39:59.240 --> 03:40:02.600
and you want to find where the vertex is when you graph it.

03:40:04.840 --> 03:40:14.600
The vertex formula says that the x coordinate of this vertex is at negative b over two a.

03:40:14.920 --> 03:40:20.040
This video gives a justification for where that formula comes from.

03:40:21.560 --> 03:40:27.240
Let's start with a specific example. Suppose I wanted to find the x intercepts and the vertex

03:40:27.240 --> 03:40:34.520
for this quadratic function. To find the x intercepts, I would set y equal to zero and solve

03:40:34.520 --> 03:40:41.160
for x. So that's zero equals three x squared plus seven x minus five. And to solve for x,

03:40:41.160 --> 03:40:47.160
I use the quadratic formula. So x is going to be negative seven plus or minus the square root of

03:40:47.160 --> 03:40:53.800
seven squared minus four times three times negative five all over two times three.

03:40:55.400 --> 03:41:02.040
That simplifies to negative seven plus or minus the square root of 109 over six.

03:41:02.040 --> 03:41:07.560
We could I could also write this as negative seven six plus the square root of 109 over six,

03:41:08.200 --> 03:41:12.920
or x equals negative seven six minus the square root of 109 over six.

03:41:13.560 --> 03:41:19.560
Since the square root of 109 is just a little bit bigger than 10, this can be approximated

03:41:19.560 --> 03:41:26.440
by negative seven six plus 10 six and negative seven six minus 10 six.

03:41:27.960 --> 03:41:34.040
So pretty close to I guess about what a half over here and pretty close to about negative

03:41:34.040 --> 03:41:39.560
three over here. I'm just going to estimate so that I can draw a picture of the function.

03:41:40.200 --> 03:41:45.160
Since the leading coefficient three is positive, I know my parabola is going to be opening up

03:41:45.720 --> 03:41:53.960
and the intercepts are somewhere around here and here. So roughly speaking, it's going to look

03:41:53.960 --> 03:42:03.400
something like this. Now the vertex is going to be somewhere in between the two x intercepts. In fact,

03:42:03.400 --> 03:42:08.600
it's going to be by symmetry, it'll be exactly halfway in between the two x intercepts.

03:42:09.160 --> 03:42:15.880
Since the x intercepts are negative seven six plus and minus 100 square root of 109 over six,

03:42:15.880 --> 03:42:20.440
the number halfway in between those is going to be exactly negative seven six.

03:42:21.800 --> 03:42:29.720
Right, because on the one hand, I have negative seven six plus something. And on the other hand,

03:42:29.720 --> 03:42:36.200
I have negative seven six minus that same thing. So negative seven six will be exactly

03:42:36.200 --> 03:42:44.200
in the middle. So my x coordinate of my vertex will be at negative seven six.

03:42:45.160 --> 03:42:48.920
Notice that I got that number from the quadratic formula.

03:42:52.040 --> 03:42:57.000
More generally, if I want to find the x intercepts for any quadratic function,

03:42:57.000 --> 03:43:04.920
I set y equal to zero and solve for x using the quadratic formula negative b plus or minus

03:43:04.920 --> 03:43:12.920
the square root of b squared minus four ac all over two a the x intercepts will be at these two

03:43:12.920 --> 03:43:19.560
values. But the x coordinate of the vertex, which is exactly halfway in between the two x intercepts

03:43:20.280 --> 03:43:25.640
will be at negative b over two a. That's where the vertex formula comes from.

03:43:26.760 --> 03:43:31.800
And it turns out that this formula works even when there are no x intercepts, even when the

03:43:31.800 --> 03:43:37.560
the quadratic formula gives us no solutions, the vertex still has the x coordinate negative b over

03:43:37.560 --> 03:43:46.760
two a. And that's the justification of the vertex formula. This video is about polynomials

03:43:46.760 --> 03:43:52.440
and their graphs. Recall that a polynomial is a function like this one, for example,

03:43:54.200 --> 03:44:01.960
whose terms are numbers times powers of x. I'll start with some definitions. The degree of a

03:44:01.960 --> 03:44:09.400
polynomial is the largest exponent. For example, for this polynomial, the degree is four.

03:44:09.800 --> 03:44:16.680
The leading term is the term with the largest exponent. In the same example, the leading term

03:44:16.680 --> 03:44:23.800
is five x to the fourth. It's conventional to write the polynomial in descending order of powers

03:44:23.800 --> 03:44:29.400
of x, so the leading term is first. But the leading term doesn't have to be the first term. If I

03:44:29.480 --> 03:44:38.520
wrote the same polynomial as y equals, say, two minus 17 x minus 21 x cubed plus five x fourth,

03:44:38.520 --> 03:44:45.240
the leading term would still be the five x to the fourth, even though it was last. The leading

03:44:45.240 --> 03:44:52.440
coefficient is the number in the leading term. In this example, the leading coefficient is five.

03:44:52.840 --> 03:44:59.000
Finally, the constant term is the term with no x's in it. In our same example, the constant term

03:44:59.000 --> 03:45:05.560
is two. Please pause the video for a moment and take a look at this next example of polynomial.

03:45:06.120 --> 03:45:10.760
Figure out what's the degree, the leading term, the leading coefficient, and the constant term.

03:45:11.960 --> 03:45:19.000
The degree is again four, since that's the highest power we have. And the leading term

03:45:19.480 --> 03:45:26.280
is negative seven x to the fourth. The leading coefficient is negative seven, and the constant

03:45:26.280 --> 03:45:35.480
term is 18. In the graph of the polynomial shown here, the three marked points are called turning

03:45:35.480 --> 03:45:41.400
points, because the polynomial turns around and changes direction at those three points.

03:45:41.880 --> 03:45:48.200
Those same points can also be called local extreme points, or they can be called local

03:45:48.200 --> 03:45:55.160
maximum and minimum points. For this polynomial, the degree is four, and the number of turning

03:45:55.160 --> 03:46:01.320
points is three. Let's compare the degree and the number of turning points for these next three

03:46:01.320 --> 03:46:10.280
examples. For the first one, the degree is two, and there's one, two, three, four, five, six,

03:46:10.520 --> 03:46:20.840
and there's one turning point. For the sixth example, the degree is three, and there's two

03:46:20.840 --> 03:46:28.200
turning points. And for this last example, the degree is four, and there's one turning point.

03:46:29.960 --> 03:46:35.400
For this first example, and the next two, the number of turning points is exactly one less than

03:46:35.400 --> 03:46:42.120
the degree. So you might conjecture that this is always true. But in fact, this is not always true.

03:46:43.000 --> 03:46:48.760
In this last example, the degree is four, but the number of turning points is one, not three.

03:46:49.960 --> 03:46:54.280
In fact, it turns out that while the number of turning points is not always equal to the

03:46:54.280 --> 03:47:01.240
degree minus one, it is always less than or equal to the degree minus one. That's a useful fact to

03:47:01.240 --> 03:47:05.400
remember when you're sketching graphs or recognizing graphs of polynomials.

03:47:06.760 --> 03:47:13.400
The end behavior of a function is how the ends of the function look as x gets bigger and bigger

03:47:13.400 --> 03:47:19.080
heads towards infinity, or x gets goes through larger and larger negative numbers towards negative

03:47:19.080 --> 03:47:27.560
infinity. In this first example, the graph of the function goes down as x gets towards infinity,

03:47:27.560 --> 03:47:33.640
and as x goes towards negative infinity, I can draw this with two little arrows pointing down on

03:47:33.640 --> 03:47:39.960
either side, or I can say in words that the function is falling as we had left and falling

03:47:39.960 --> 03:47:47.640
also as we had right. In the second example, the graph rises to the left and rises to the right.

03:47:48.760 --> 03:47:55.240
In the third example, the graph falls to the left, but rises to the right. And in the fourth

03:47:55.240 --> 03:48:02.520
example, it rises to the left and falls to the right. If you study these examples and others,

03:48:02.520 --> 03:48:09.400
you might notice there's a relationship between the degree of the polynomial, the leading coefficients

03:48:09.400 --> 03:48:16.120
of the polynomials, and the end behavior. Specifically, these four types of end behavior

03:48:16.120 --> 03:48:23.400
are determined by whether the degree is even or odd, and by whether the leading coefficient

03:48:23.960 --> 03:48:31.880
is positive or negative. When the degree is even, and the leading coefficient is positive,

03:48:32.520 --> 03:48:39.320
like in this example where the leading coefficient is one, we have this sorts of end behavior rising

03:48:39.320 --> 03:48:45.720
on both sides. When the degree is even and the leading coefficient is negative, like in this

03:48:45.720 --> 03:48:53.320
example, we have the end behavior that's falling on both sides. When the degree is odd, and the

03:48:53.320 --> 03:48:58.520
leading coefficient is positive, that's like this example, with a degree three and a leading

03:48:58.520 --> 03:49:06.440
coefficient three, then we have this sort of end behavior. And finally, when the degree is odd,

03:49:06.440 --> 03:49:11.880
and the leading coefficient is negative, like in this example, we have this sort of end behavior.

03:49:12.520 --> 03:49:19.560
I like to remember this chart just by thinking of the most simple examples, y equals x squared,

03:49:19.560 --> 03:49:26.200
y equals negative x squared, y equals x cubed, and y equals negative x cubed, because I know by

03:49:26.200 --> 03:49:35.080
heart what those four examples look like. Then I just have to remember that any polynomial with a

03:49:35.080 --> 03:49:42.760
any polynomial with an even degree and positive leading coefficient has the same end behavior

03:49:42.760 --> 03:49:50.600
as x squared. And similarly, any polynomial with even degree and negative leading coefficient

03:49:50.600 --> 03:49:57.080
has the same end behavior as negative x squared, and similar statements for x cubed and negative x

03:49:57.080 --> 03:50:03.960
cubed. We can use facts about turning points and end behavior to say something about the equation

03:50:03.960 --> 03:50:11.240
of a polynomial just by looking at its graph. In this example, because of the end behavior,

03:50:11.240 --> 03:50:17.800
we know that the degree is odd. We know that the leading coefficient

03:50:19.720 --> 03:50:27.800
must be positive. And finally, since there are one, two, three, four turning points,

03:50:27.800 --> 03:50:35.480
we know that the degree is greater than or equal to five. That's because the number of

03:50:35.480 --> 03:50:41.960
turning points is less than or equal to the degree minus one. And in this case, the number of turning

03:50:41.960 --> 03:50:49.640
points we said was four. And so solving that inequality, we get the degree is bigger than

03:50:49.640 --> 03:50:56.440
or equal to five. Putting some of that information together, we see that the degree could be

03:50:58.040 --> 03:51:04.680
five or seven or nine, or any odd number greater than or equal to five. But it couldn't be, for

03:51:04.680 --> 03:51:13.080
example, three or six, because even numbers and and also numbers less than five are right out.

03:51:13.080 --> 03:51:20.600
This video gave a lot of definitions, including the definition of degree, leading coefficients,

03:51:22.200 --> 03:51:31.720
turning points, and end behavior. We saw that knowing the degree and the leading coefficient

03:51:31.720 --> 03:51:35.720
can help you make predictions about the number of turning points and the end behavior,

03:51:36.600 --> 03:51:42.440
as well as vice versa. This video is about exponential functions and their graphs.

03:51:44.040 --> 03:51:50.760
An exponential function is a function that can be written in the form f of x equals a times b to

03:51:50.760 --> 03:51:58.200
the x, where a and b are any real numbers, as long as a is not zero, and b is positive.

03:51:59.480 --> 03:52:05.480
It's important to notice that for an exponential function, the variable x is in the exponent.

03:52:06.120 --> 03:52:11.320
This is different from many other functions we've seen. For example, a quadratic function

03:52:11.320 --> 03:52:17.560
like f of x equals three x squared has the variable in the base. So it's not an exponential function.

03:52:19.480 --> 03:52:27.160
For exponential functions, f of x equals a times b to the x, we require that a is not equal to zero,

03:52:27.160 --> 03:52:35.080
because otherwise, we would have f of x equals zero times b to the x, which just means that f of x

03:52:35.080 --> 03:52:41.400
equals zero. And this is called a constant function, not an exponential function. Because f of x is

03:52:41.400 --> 03:52:49.480
always equal to zero. In an exponential function, we require that b is bigger than zero, because

03:52:49.480 --> 03:53:00.840
otherwise, for example, if b is equal to negative one, say, we'd have f of x equals a times negative

03:53:00.840 --> 03:53:07.480
one to the x. Now, this would make sense for a lot of values of x. But if we tried to do something

03:53:07.480 --> 03:53:15.880
like f of one half with our b's negative one, that would be the same thing as a times the square root

03:53:15.880 --> 03:53:23.080
of negative one, which is not a real number. We'd get the same problem for other values of b, if the

03:53:23.080 --> 03:53:31.080
values of b were negative. And if we tried b equals zero, we'd get a kind of ridiculous thing a times

03:53:31.080 --> 03:53:37.000
zero to the x, which again is always zero. So that wouldn't count as an exponential either. So we can't

03:53:37.000 --> 03:53:41.400
use any negative bases, and we can't use zero bases if we want an exponential function.

03:53:42.760 --> 03:53:49.880
The number a in the expression f of x equals a times b to the x is called the initial value.

03:53:50.280 --> 03:53:58.360
And the number b is called the base. The phrase initial value comes to the fact that if we plug in

03:53:58.360 --> 03:54:05.560
x equals zero, we get a times b to the zero, well, anything to the zero is just one. So this is equal

03:54:05.560 --> 03:54:15.880
to a. In other words, f of zero equals a. So if we think of starting out, when x equals zero, we get

03:54:15.960 --> 03:54:22.360
we get the y value of a. That's why it's called the initial value.

03:54:27.160 --> 03:54:32.680
Let's start out with this example, where y equals a times b to the x, an exponential function,

03:54:32.680 --> 03:54:39.800
and we've set a equal to one and b equals the two. Notice that the y intercept, the value when x is

03:54:39.800 --> 03:54:49.560
zero is going to be one. If I change my a value, my initial value, the y intercept changes.

03:54:50.600 --> 03:54:59.720
The function is stretched out. If I make the value of a go to zero and then negative,

03:55:01.080 --> 03:55:07.080
then my initial value becomes negative and my graph flips across the x-axis.

03:55:08.040 --> 03:55:13.960
Let's go back to an a value of say one and see what happens when we change b.

03:55:15.000 --> 03:55:25.000
Right now, the b value, the base is two. If I increase b, my y intercept sticks at one,

03:55:25.000 --> 03:55:33.080
but my graph becomes steeper and steeper. If I put b back down close to one, my graph becomes

03:55:33.800 --> 03:55:38.520
more flat. At exactly one, my graph is just a constant.

03:55:40.520 --> 03:55:48.600
As b gets into fractional territory, 0.8, 0.7, 0.6, my graph starts to slope the other way.

03:55:48.600 --> 03:55:54.280
It's decreasing now instead of increasing, but notice that the y intercept still hasn't changed.

03:55:55.400 --> 03:56:00.920
I can get it more and more steep as my b gets farther and farther away from one. Of course,

03:56:00.920 --> 03:56:04.040
when b goes to negative territory, my graph doesn't make any sense.

03:56:07.800 --> 03:56:19.160
So a changes the y intercept and b changes the steepness of the graph, whether it's increasing

03:56:19.160 --> 03:56:24.760
for b values bigger than one and decreasing for values of b less than one.

03:56:25.720 --> 03:56:33.720
We'll summarize all these observations on the next slide. We've seen that for an exponential

03:56:33.720 --> 03:56:41.560
function, y equals a times b to the x, the parameter or number a gives the y intercept.

03:56:42.280 --> 03:56:47.880
The parameter b tells us how the graph is increasing or decreasing. Specifically,

03:56:47.880 --> 03:56:56.440
if b is greater than one, the graph is increasing. And if b is less than one, the graph is decreasing.

03:56:58.200 --> 03:57:01.880
The closer b is to the number one, the flatter the graph.

03:57:03.240 --> 03:57:11.800
So for example, if I were to graph y equals 0.25 to the x, and y equals 0.4 to the x,

03:57:12.760 --> 03:57:18.200
they would both be decreasing graphs, since the base for both of them is less than one.

03:57:18.920 --> 03:57:27.720
But 0.25 is farther away from one, and 0.4 is closer to one. So 0.4 is going to be flatter,

03:57:27.720 --> 03:57:35.880
and 0.25 is going to be more steep. So in this picture, this red graph would correspond to

03:57:35.960 --> 03:57:41.240
0.25 to the x, and the blue graph would correspond to 0.4 to the x.

03:57:43.240 --> 03:57:49.000
For all these exponential functions, whether the graphs are decreasing or increasing,

03:57:49.000 --> 03:57:56.120
they all have a horizontal asymptote along the x axis, in other words, at the line y equals zero.

03:57:57.080 --> 03:58:03.480
The domain is always from negative infinity to infinity. And the range is always

03:58:03.880 --> 03:58:14.040
from zero to infinity, because the range is always positive y values. Actually, that's true

03:58:14.600 --> 03:58:24.920
if a is greater than zero. If a is less than zero, then our graph flips over the x axis. Our domain

03:58:24.920 --> 03:58:32.360
stays the same, but our range becomes negative infinity to zero. The most famous exponential

03:58:32.360 --> 03:58:38.440
function is f of x equals e to the x. This function is also sometimes written as f of x equals x of

03:58:38.440 --> 03:58:46.040
x. The number e is Euler's number, and it's approximately 2.7. This function has important

03:58:46.040 --> 03:58:53.240
applications to calculus and to some compound interest problems. In this video, we looked at

03:58:53.240 --> 03:59:00.200
exponential functions, functions of the form a times b to the x, where the variable is in the exponent.

03:59:00.760 --> 03:59:11.560
We saw that they all have the same general shape, either increasing like this, or decreasing like this,

03:59:12.520 --> 03:59:16.760
unless a is negative, in which case they flip over the x axis.

03:59:18.600 --> 03:59:24.520
They all have a horizontal asymptote at y equals zero, the x axis.

03:59:24.760 --> 03:59:31.720
In this video, we'll use exponential functions to model real world examples.

03:59:32.760 --> 03:59:39.160
Let's suppose you're hired for a job. The starting salary is $40,000, with a guaranteed

03:59:39.160 --> 03:59:47.480
annual raise of 3% each year. How much will your salary be after one year? Two years, five years,

03:59:47.480 --> 03:59:54.200
and in general after t years. Let me chart out the information. The left column will be the

03:59:54.200 --> 03:59:59.080
number of years since you're hired, and the right column will be your salary.

04:00:00.920 --> 04:00:07.000
When you start work, that's zero years after you're hired, your salary will be $40,000.

04:00:09.880 --> 04:00:17.000
After one year, you'll have gotten a 3% raise. So your salary will be the original 40,000

04:00:17.640 --> 04:00:29.160
plus 3% of 40,000. 0.03 times 40,000. I can think of this first number as one times 40,000.

04:00:29.720 --> 04:00:40.600
And I can factor out the 40,000 from both terms to get 40,000 times one plus 0.03.

04:00:40.600 --> 04:00:50.440
Let me rewrite this as 40,000 times 1.03. This is your original salary

04:00:51.240 --> 04:01:00.520
multiplied by a growth factor of 1.03. After two years, you'll get a 3% raise

04:01:00.520 --> 04:01:07.480
from your previous year salary. Your previous year salary was 40,000 times 1.03,

04:01:08.040 --> 04:01:17.880
but you'll add 3% of that. Again, I can think of the first number as one times 40,000 times 1.03.

04:01:18.440 --> 04:01:27.080
And I can factor out the common factor of 40,000 times 1.03 from both terms to get 40,000

04:01:27.960 --> 04:01:39.720
times 1.03 times one plus 0.03. Let me rewrite that as 40,000 times 1.03 times 1.03,

04:01:40.360 --> 04:01:48.440
or 40,000 times 1.03 squared. We can think of this as your last year's salary

04:01:49.240 --> 04:01:59.240
multiplied by the same growth factor of 1.03. After three years, a similar computation will

04:01:59.240 --> 04:02:08.040
give you that your new salary is your previous year's salary times that growth factor of 1.03.

04:02:09.160 --> 04:02:17.480
That can be written as 40,000 times 1.03 cubed. And in general, if you're noticing the pattern

04:02:17.560 --> 04:02:27.640
after T years, your salary should be 40,000 times 1.03 to the T power. In other words, your salary

04:02:27.640 --> 04:02:40.600
after T years is your original salary multiplied by the growth factor of 1.03 taken to the T power.

04:02:40.920 --> 04:02:51.640
Let me write this as a formula. S of T, where S of T is your salary, is equal to 40,000 times 1.03

04:02:51.640 --> 04:03:00.440
to the T. This is an exponential function, that is a function of the form A times B to the T,

04:03:01.400 --> 04:03:13.000
where your initial value A is 40,000, and your base B is 1.03. Notice that your base

04:03:13.000 --> 04:03:19.880
is the amount that your salary gets multiplied by each year. Given this formula, we can easily

04:03:19.880 --> 04:03:25.560
figure out what your salary will be after, for example, five years by plugging in five for T.

04:03:26.280 --> 04:03:35.080
I worked that out on my calculator to be 46,370 dollars and 96 cents to the nearest cent.

04:03:37.400 --> 04:03:41.160
Exponential functions are also useful in modeling population growth.

04:03:41.800 --> 04:03:48.360
The United Nations estimated that the world population in 2010 was 6.79 billion, growing at

04:03:48.360 --> 04:03:53.880
a rate of 1.1 percent per year. Assuming that the growth rate stayed the same and will continue

04:03:53.880 --> 04:04:00.200
to stay the same, we'll write an equation for the population at T years after the year 2010.

04:04:02.280 --> 04:04:10.600
1.1 percent, written as a decimal, is 0.011. So if we work out a chart as before,

04:04:11.800 --> 04:04:18.920
we see that after zero years since 2010, we have our initial population, 6.79 billion.

04:04:19.480 --> 04:04:32.040
After one year, we'll take that 6.79 billion and add 1.1 percent of it, that is 0.011 times 6.79.

04:04:32.760 --> 04:04:36.520
This works out to 6.79 times

04:04:37.160 --> 04:04:50.200
1 plus 0.011 or 6.79 times 1.011. Here we have our initial population

04:04:51.080 --> 04:05:01.720
of 6.79 billion and our growth factor of 1.011. That's how much the population

04:05:01.720 --> 04:05:09.880
got multiplied by in one year. As before, we can work out that after two years,

04:05:09.880 --> 04:05:20.040
our population becomes 6.79 times 1.011 squared since it got multiplied by 1.011 twice. And after

04:05:20.040 --> 04:05:30.920
two years, it'll be 6.79 times 1.011 to the T power. So our function that models population

04:05:32.280 --> 04:05:46.200
is going to be 6.79 times 1.011 to the T. Here, T represents time in years since 2010.

04:05:47.160 --> 04:05:55.320
Just for fun, I'll plug in T equals 40. That's 40 years since 2010. So that's the year

04:05:55.960 --> 04:06:06.680
2050. And I get 6.79 times 1.011 to the 40th power, which works out to 10.5 billion.

04:06:07.480 --> 04:06:11.080
That's the prediction based on this exponential model.

04:06:11.080 --> 04:06:18.520
The previous two examples were examples of exponential growth. This last example

04:06:18.520 --> 04:06:24.200
is an example of exponential decay. The drug Cerroquel is metabolized and eliminated from the

04:06:24.200 --> 04:06:32.440
body at a rate of 11% per hour. If 400 milligrams are given, how much remains in the body 24 hours

04:06:32.440 --> 04:06:42.840
later? I'll chart out my information where the left column will be time in hours since the dose

04:06:42.840 --> 04:06:49.960
was given. And the right column will be the number of milligrams of Cerroquel still in the body.

04:06:51.400 --> 04:06:56.360
Zero hours after the dose is given, we have the full 400 milligrams in the body.

04:06:57.240 --> 04:07:05.720
One hour later, we have the 400 milligrams minus 11% of it. That's minus 0.11 times 400.

04:07:07.080 --> 04:07:19.480
If I factor out the 400 from both terms, I get 400 times 1 minus 0.11, or 400 times 0.89.

04:07:20.360 --> 04:07:27.960
The 400 represents the initial amount. The 0.89, I'll call the growth factor,

04:07:27.960 --> 04:07:33.320
even though in this case, the quantity is decreasing, not growing. So really, it's kind of a shrink factor.

04:07:37.320 --> 04:07:45.000
Let's see what happens after two hours. Now I'll have 400 times 0.89. My previous amount,

04:07:45.960 --> 04:07:53.640
it'll again get multiplied by 0.89. So that's going to be 400 times 0.89 squared. And in general,

04:07:53.640 --> 04:08:01.240
after t hours, I'll have 400 multiplied by this growth or shrinkage factor of 0.89

04:08:01.880 --> 04:08:09.080
raised to the t power. Since each hour, the amount of Cerroquel gets multiplied by 0.89,

04:08:09.080 --> 04:08:17.080
that number less than one. I'll write my exponential decay function as f of t equals 400

04:08:17.080 --> 04:08:26.600
times 0.89 to the t, where f of t represents the number of milligrams of Cerroquel in the body,

04:08:27.560 --> 04:08:31.880
and t represents the number of hours since the dose was given.

04:08:32.840 --> 04:08:39.480
To find out how much is in the body after 24 hours, I just plug in 24 for t.

04:08:41.480 --> 04:08:49.000
This works out to about 24.4 milligrams. I hope you noticed the common form for the functions

04:08:49.000 --> 04:08:55.800
used to model all three of these examples. The functions were always in the form f of t equals

04:08:55.800 --> 04:09:05.560
a times b to the t, where a represented the initial amount, and b represented the growth factor.

04:09:08.200 --> 04:09:13.880
To find the growth factor b, we started with the percent increase or decrease.

04:09:15.080 --> 04:09:21.320
We wrote it as a decimal. And then we either added it or subtracted it from one,

04:09:21.320 --> 04:09:27.160
depending on whether the quantity was increasing or decreasing. Let me show you that as a couple

04:09:27.160 --> 04:09:37.960
examples. In the first example, we had a percent increase of 3% on the raise. As a decimal, I'll

04:09:37.960 --> 04:09:47.880
call this r, this was 0.03. And to get the growth factor, we added that to 1 to get 1.03. In the

04:09:47.880 --> 04:09:56.520
world population example, we had a 1.1% increase. We wrote this as 0.011 and added it to 1

04:09:59.560 --> 04:10:10.760
to get 1.011. In the drug example, we had a decrease of 11%. We wrote that as a decimal.

04:10:11.720 --> 04:10:23.400
And we subtracted the 0.11 from one to get 0.89. In fact, you can always write the

04:10:23.400 --> 04:10:31.480
growth factor b as 1 plus the percent change written as a decimal. If you're careful to

04:10:31.480 --> 04:10:37.320
make that percent change negative when the quantity is decreasing and positive when the

04:10:37.320 --> 04:10:44.760
quantity is increasing, since here one plus negative 0.11 gives us the correct growth factor of 0.89,

04:10:44.760 --> 04:10:51.480
which is less than one. As a good check, remember that if your quantity is increasing,

04:10:52.920 --> 04:10:58.360
the base b should be bigger than one. And if the quantity is decreasing,

04:10:59.800 --> 04:11:06.520
then b should be less than one. Exponential functions can also be used to model bank accounts

04:11:06.520 --> 04:11:13.160
and loans with compound interest, as we'll see in another video. This video is about

04:11:13.160 --> 04:11:20.520
interpreting exponential functions. An antique car is worth $50,000 now, and its value increases by

04:11:20.520 --> 04:11:29.960
7% each year. Let's write an equation to model its value x years from now. After one year, its value

04:11:30.200 --> 04:11:43.480
is the 50,000 plus 0.07 times the 50,000. That's because its value has grown by 7% or 0.07

04:11:43.480 --> 04:11:54.600
times 50,000. This can be written as 50,000 times one plus 0.07. Notice that adding 7%

04:11:55.560 --> 04:12:05.000
to the original value is the same as multiplying the original value by one plus 0.07, or by 1.07.

04:12:06.840 --> 04:12:19.000
After two years, the value will be 50,000 times one plus 0.07 squared, or 50,000 times

04:12:19.080 --> 04:12:26.920
1.07 squared. That's because the previous year's value is multiplied again by 1.07.

04:12:28.680 --> 04:12:38.280
And in general, after x years, v of x, the antique car's value will be 50,000

04:12:39.320 --> 04:12:48.760
times 1.07 to the x. That's because the original value of 50,000 gets multiplied by 1.07

04:12:48.760 --> 04:12:54.840
x times one time for each year. If we dissect this equation, we see that the

04:12:55.640 --> 04:13:03.240
number of 50,000 comes from the original value of the car. The 1.07, which I call the growth factor,

04:13:04.920 --> 04:13:16.520
comes from 1 plus 0.07. The 0.07 being the percent increase written as a decimal.

04:13:16.760 --> 04:13:24.840
So the form of this equation is an exponential equation, v of x equals a times b to the x,

04:13:24.840 --> 04:13:33.000
where a is the initial value, and b is the growth factor. But we could also write this as a times

04:13:33.000 --> 04:13:43.080
one plus r to the x, where a is still the initial value, but r is the percent increase written

04:13:43.080 --> 04:13:51.640
as a decimal. This same equation will come up in the next example. Here, my Toyota Prius is

04:13:51.640 --> 04:14:00.120
worth only 3,000 now, and its value is decreasing by 5% each year. So after one year, its value

04:14:00.840 --> 04:14:16.120
will be 3,000 minus 0.05 times 3,000. That is 3,000 times 1 minus 0.05. I can also write that as

04:14:16.120 --> 04:14:29.880
3,000 times 0.95. Decreasing the value by 5% is like multiplying the value by one minus 0.05 or by

04:14:29.880 --> 04:14:43.080
0.95. After two years, the value will be multiplied by 0.95 again. So the value will be 3,000 times

04:14:43.080 --> 04:14:55.240
0.95 squared. And after x years, the value will be 3,000 times 0.95 to the x. So my equation for

04:14:55.240 --> 04:15:06.760
the value is 3,000 times 0.95 to the x. This is again an equation of the form v of x equals a

04:15:06.760 --> 04:15:20.440
times b to the x, where here a is 3,000, the initial value, and b is 0.95. I'll still call that the

04:15:20.440 --> 04:15:26.760
growth factor, even though we're actually declining in value, not growing. Now remember where this

04:15:26.760 --> 04:15:36.520
0.95 came from, it came from taking one and subtracting 0.05 because of the 5% decrease in value.

04:15:37.560 --> 04:15:44.600
So I can again write my equation in the form a times, well this time times 1 minus r to the x,

04:15:45.320 --> 04:15:56.040
where r is our 0.05, that's our percent decrease written as a decimal. Please take a moment to

04:15:56.040 --> 04:16:04.120
study this equation and the previous one. These say that when you have an exponential function,

04:16:05.000 --> 04:16:12.200
the number here is the initial value. If it's written in this form, b is your growth factor,

04:16:12.200 --> 04:16:18.760
but you can think of b as being either 1 minus r, where r is the percent decrease,

04:16:18.760 --> 04:16:27.240
or 1 plus r, where r is the percent increase. In this example, we're given a function f of x

04:16:27.240 --> 04:16:32.920
to model the number of bacteria in a Petri dish, x hours after 12 o'clock noon.

04:16:34.360 --> 04:16:39.240
We want to know what was the number of bacteria at noon and by what percent the number of bacteria

04:16:39.240 --> 04:16:45.720
is increasing every hour. We can see from the equation that the number of bacteria is increasing

04:16:45.720 --> 04:16:51.880
and not decreasing because the base of the exponential function, 1.45, is bigger than 1.

04:16:51.880 --> 04:17:02.680
Notice that our equation f of x equals 12 times 1.45 to the x has the form of a times b to the x,

04:17:02.680 --> 04:17:14.680
or we can think of it as a times 1 plus r to the x. Here a is 12, b is 1.45, and r is 0.45.

04:17:15.400 --> 04:17:23.000
Based on this familiar form, we can recognize that the initial amount of bacteria is going to be 12,

04:17:23.800 --> 04:17:32.600
12,000, since those are our units. And this value 1.45 is our growth factor,

04:17:33.720 --> 04:17:43.800
what the number of bacteria is multiplied by each hour, while r, the 0.45, is the rate of increase.

04:17:43.800 --> 04:17:55.960
In other words, a 45 percent increase each hour. So our answers to the questions are 12,000 and 45

04:17:55.960 --> 04:18:03.480
percent. In this example, the population of salamanders is modeled by this exponential function,

04:18:04.200 --> 04:18:07.000
where x is the number of years since 2015.

04:18:07.480 --> 04:18:16.440
Notice that the number of salamanders is decreasing, because the base of our exponential function,

04:18:16.440 --> 04:18:25.080
0.78, is less than 1. So if we recognize the form of our exponential function, a times b to the x,

04:18:25.080 --> 04:18:36.680
or we can think of this as a times 1 minus r to the x, where a is our initial value and r is our

04:18:37.320 --> 04:18:47.640
decrease, written as a decimal. Our initial value is 3000. So that's the number of salamanders

04:18:47.640 --> 04:18:59.640
zero years after 2015. Our growth factor b is 0.78. But if I write that as 1 minus r, I see that r

04:18:59.640 --> 04:19:11.240
has to be 1 minus 0.78 or 0.22. In other words, our population is decreasing by 22 percent each year.

04:19:12.600 --> 04:19:19.560
In this video, we saw that exponential functions can be written in the form f of x equals a times

04:19:19.560 --> 04:19:27.320
b to the x, where a is the initial value, and b is the growth factor.

04:19:29.400 --> 04:19:37.080
We also saw that they can be written in the form a times 1 plus r to the x, when the amount is

04:19:37.080 --> 04:19:44.360
increasing, and as a times 1 minus r to the x, when the amount is decreasing.

04:19:44.920 --> 04:19:54.200
In this format, r is the percent increase, or the percent decrease, written as a decimal.

04:19:56.520 --> 04:20:10.840
So a 15 percent increase will be an r value of 0.15 and a growth factor b of 1.15, whereas a 12

04:20:10.840 --> 04:20:26.200
percent decrease will be an r value of 0.12 and a b value of 1 minus 0.12 or 0.88.

04:20:27.880 --> 04:20:34.680
These observations help us quickly interpret exponential functions. For example, here we have

04:20:35.640 --> 04:20:45.080
an initial value of 100 and a 15 percent increase, and here we have an initial value of 50 and

04:20:46.520 --> 04:20:48.680
a 40 percent decrease.

04:20:50.680 --> 04:20:55.640
Exponential functions can be used to model compound interest for loans and bank accounts.

04:20:56.760 --> 04:21:01.880
Suppose you invest $200 in a bank account that earns 3 percent interest every year.

04:21:01.880 --> 04:21:08.760
If you make no deposits or withdrawals, how much money will you have accumulated after 10 years?

04:21:10.120 --> 04:21:14.360
Because 3 percent of the money that's in the bank is getting added each year,

04:21:14.360 --> 04:21:23.400
the money in the bank gets multiplied by 1.03 each year. So after one year, the amount will be

04:21:23.400 --> 04:21:36.520
200 times 1.03 after two years, 200 times 1.03 squared, and after T years, 200 times 1.03 to

04:21:36.520 --> 04:21:44.520
the T power. So the function modeling the amount of money, I'll call it P of T, is given by 200

04:21:44.520 --> 04:21:51.080
times 1.03 to the T. More generally, if you invest A dollars

04:21:53.160 --> 04:21:59.080
at an annual interest rate of R for T years,

04:22:01.480 --> 04:22:07.800
in the end, you'll have P of T equals A times 1 plus R to the T.

04:22:08.760 --> 04:22:17.080
Here, R needs to be written as a decimal, so 0.03 in our example for the 3 percent annual interest rate.

04:22:18.440 --> 04:22:25.400
Going back to our specific example, after 10 years, the amount of money is going to be P of 10,

04:22:25.400 --> 04:22:35.240
which is 200 times 1.03 to the 10, which works out to $268.78 to the nearest cent.

04:22:35.320 --> 04:22:41.160
In this problem, we've assumed that the interest accumulates once per year. But in the next few

04:22:41.160 --> 04:22:46.120
examples, we'll see what happens when the interest rate accumulates more frequently, twice a year,

04:22:46.120 --> 04:22:54.120
or every month, for example. Let's deposit $300 in an account that earns 4.5 percent annual

04:22:54.120 --> 04:23:00.120
interest compounded semi-annually. This means two times a year, or every six months.

04:23:00.120 --> 04:23:12.920
A 4.5 percent annual interest rate compounded two times a year means that we're actually getting

04:23:12.920 --> 04:23:21.560
4.5 over 2 percent interest every time the interest is compounded, that is, every six months.

04:23:22.040 --> 04:23:38.280
That's 2.25 percent interest every half a year. Note that 2.25 percent is the same as 0.025 as a

04:23:38.280 --> 04:23:51.000
decimal. So every time we earn interest, our money gets multiplied by 1.025. Let me make a chart of

04:23:51.000 --> 04:23:59.960
what happens. After zero years, which is also zero half years, we have our original $300.

04:24:00.920 --> 04:24:07.720
After a half a year, that's one half year, our money gets earns interest one time. So we multiply

04:24:07.720 --> 04:24:17.560
the 300 by 1.025. After one year, that's two half years, our money earns interest two times.

04:24:17.560 --> 04:24:29.640
So we multiply 300 by 1.0 225 squared. Continuing this way, after 1.5 years, that's three half years,

04:24:30.200 --> 04:24:38.360
we have 300 times 1.0 225 cubed. And after two years, or four half years, we have 300 times

04:24:38.360 --> 04:24:49.640
1.0 225 to the fourth. In general, after T years, which is two T half years, our money will grow to

04:24:49.640 --> 04:25:01.160
300 times 1.0 225 to the two T power, because we've compounded interest two T times. Our formula for

04:25:01.160 --> 04:25:10.200
our amount of money is P of T equals 300 times 1.0 225 to the two T, where T is the number of years.

04:25:12.520 --> 04:25:22.680
To finish the problem, after seven years, we'll have P of $7, which is 300 times 1.0 225 to the

04:25:22.680 --> 04:25:33.800
two times seven or 14 power. And that works out to $409.65 to the nearest cent.

04:25:35.400 --> 04:25:41.800
In this next example, we're going to take out a loan for $1,200 at an annual interest rate of 6%

04:25:42.360 --> 04:25:49.560
compounded monthly. Although loans and bank accounts might feel different, they're mathematically the

04:25:49.560 --> 04:25:55.240
same. It's like from the bank's point of view, they're investing money in you and getting interest

04:25:55.240 --> 04:26:03.880
on their money from you. So we can work them out with the same kind of math. 6% annual interest rate

04:26:05.080 --> 04:26:13.000
compounded monthly means you're compounding 12 times a year. So each time you compound interest,

04:26:13.000 --> 04:26:23.800
you're just going to get 6 over 12% interest. That's 0.5% interest. And as a decimal, that's

04:26:24.360 --> 04:26:29.960
0.005. Let's chart out again what happens.

04:26:32.280 --> 04:26:42.360
Time zero, of course, you'll have the original loan amount of 1200. After one year, that's 12 months,

04:26:43.160 --> 04:26:53.640
your loan has had interest added to it 12 times. So it gets multiplied by 1.005 to the 12th.

04:26:55.240 --> 04:27:03.720
After two years, that's 24 months, it's had interest added to it 24 times. So it gets

04:27:03.720 --> 04:27:10.920
multiplied by 1.005 to the 24th power. Similarly, after three years or 36 months,

04:27:11.480 --> 04:27:21.720
your loan amount will be 1200 times 1.005 to the 36th power. And in general, after T years,

04:27:22.280 --> 04:27:31.560
that's 12 T months. So the interest will be compounded 12 T times. And so we have to raise

04:27:31.560 --> 04:27:41.160
the 1.005 to the 12 T power. This gives us the general formula for the money owed is P of T equals

04:27:41.720 --> 04:27:49.320
1200 times 1.005 to the 12 T, where T is the number of years.

04:27:51.640 --> 04:28:00.280
In particular, after three years, we'll have to pay back a total of 1200 times 1.005

04:28:00.280 --> 04:28:05.240
to the 12 times three or 36 power, which works out to

04:28:07.240 --> 04:28:16.360
$1,436.02 to the nearest cent. These last two problems follow a general pattern.

04:28:17.080 --> 04:28:25.800
If A is the initial amount of the loan or bank account, and R is the annual interest rate,

04:28:26.120 --> 04:28:39.080
compounded N times per year, then our formula for the amount of money is going to be A times

04:28:39.080 --> 04:28:48.520
1 plus R over N to the NT. This formula exactly matches what we did in this problem. First,

04:28:48.520 --> 04:28:54.920
we took the interest rate R, which was 6%, and divided it by the number of compounding periods

04:28:54.920 --> 04:29:02.680
each year, 12. We wrote that as a decimal and added one to it. That's where we got the 1.005

04:29:02.680 --> 04:29:10.200
from. We raised this to not to the number of years, but to 12 times the number of years.

04:29:10.200 --> 04:29:14.120
That's the number of compounding periods per year times the number of years.

04:29:15.400 --> 04:29:19.720
And we multiplied all that by the initial amount of money, which was 1200.

04:29:20.200 --> 04:29:25.080
This formula for compounded interest is a good one to memorize, but it's also important to be able

04:29:25.080 --> 04:29:29.880
to reason your way through it, like we did in this chart. There's one more type of compounded

04:29:29.880 --> 04:29:36.120
interest, and that's interest compounded continuously. You can think of continuous compounding

04:29:36.120 --> 04:29:42.680
as the limit of compounding more and more frequently. 10 times a year, 100 times a year,

04:29:42.680 --> 04:29:47.560
1,000 times a year, a million times a year. In the limit, you get continuous compounding.

04:29:47.560 --> 04:29:56.760
The formula for continuous compounding is p of t equals a times e to the rt,

04:29:57.480 --> 04:30:03.640
where p of t is the amount of money. t is the time in years.

04:30:05.640 --> 04:30:08.120
a is the initial amount of money.

04:30:10.120 --> 04:30:16.760
And r is the annual interest rate written as a decimal.

04:30:17.720 --> 04:30:24.600
So 0.025 in this problem from the 2.5% annual interest rate.

04:30:25.880 --> 04:30:32.280
e represents the famous constant Euler's constant, which is about 2.718.

04:30:33.640 --> 04:30:43.480
So in this problem, we have p of t is 4,000 times e to the 0.025 t.

04:30:43.720 --> 04:30:53.000
And after five years, we'll have p of 5, which is 4,000 times e to the 0.025 times 5,

04:30:54.360 --> 04:31:01.000
which works out to $4,532.59 to the nearest cent.

04:31:02.200 --> 04:31:08.200
To summarize, if r represents the annual interest rate written as a decimal,

04:31:08.440 --> 04:31:20.120
that is 2% would be 0.02, and t represents the number of years, and a represents the initial

04:31:20.120 --> 04:31:26.920
amount of money, then for just simple annual interest compounded once a year, our formula

04:31:26.920 --> 04:31:35.560
is p of t is a times 1 plus r to the t. For compound interest compounded n times per year,

04:31:36.280 --> 04:31:44.920
our formula is p of t is a times 1 plus r over n to the nt. And for compound interest

04:31:44.920 --> 04:31:50.760
compounded continuously, we get p of t is a times e to the rt.

04:31:52.760 --> 04:31:56.280
In this video, we looked at three kinds of compound interest problems.

04:31:57.000 --> 04:32:04.680
Simple annual interest, interest compounded n times per year, and continuously compounded interest.

04:32:06.520 --> 04:32:08.760
This video introduces logarithms.

04:32:10.760 --> 04:32:19.960
Logarithms are a way of writing exponents. The expression log base a of b equals c means that

04:32:19.960 --> 04:32:30.840
a to the c equals b. In other words, log base a of b is the exponent that you raise a to to get b.

04:32:31.800 --> 04:32:38.040
The number a is called the base of the logarithm. It's also called the base when we write it in

04:32:38.040 --> 04:32:45.000
this exponential form. Some students find it helpful to remember this relationship log base a of b

04:32:45.000 --> 04:32:55.800
equals c means a to the c equals b by drawing arrows a to the c equals b. Other students like

04:32:55.800 --> 04:33:05.880
to think of it in terms of asking a question. log base a of b asks, what power do you raise a to

04:33:07.160 --> 04:33:17.800
in order to get b? Let's look at some examples. log base two of eight is three, because two

04:33:17.880 --> 04:33:25.400
to the three equals eight. In general, log base two of y is asking you the question,

04:33:26.040 --> 04:33:36.040
what power do you have to raise two to to get y? So for example, log base two of 16 is four,

04:33:36.040 --> 04:33:42.120
because it's asking you the question to to what power equals 16. And the answer is four.

04:33:43.080 --> 04:33:50.280
Please pause the video and try some of these other examples. log base two of two is asking,

04:33:50.280 --> 04:33:55.480
what power do you raise two to to get two? And the answer is one.

04:33:58.280 --> 04:34:07.800
two to the one equals two. log base two of one half is asking two to what power gives you one

04:34:07.800 --> 04:34:14.760
half. Well, to get one half, you need to raise two to a negative power. So that would be two

04:34:14.760 --> 04:34:23.240
to the negative one. So the answer is negative one. log base two of one eighth means what power do

04:34:23.240 --> 04:34:32.520
we raise two to in order to get one eighth. Since one eighth is one over two cubed, we have to raise

04:34:32.520 --> 04:34:41.080
two to the negative three power to get one over two cubed. So our exponent is negative three.

04:34:41.080 --> 04:34:49.720
And that's our answer to our log expression. Finally, log base two of one is asking to to what

04:34:49.720 --> 04:34:57.400
power equals one. Well, anything raised to the zero power gives us one. So this log expression

04:34:57.400 --> 04:35:04.520
evaluates to zero. Notice that we can get positive negative and zero answers for our

04:35:04.520 --> 04:35:10.520
logarithm expressions. Please pause the video and figure out what these logs evaluate to

04:35:12.760 --> 04:35:17.960
to work out log base 10 of a million. Notice that a million

04:35:19.560 --> 04:35:27.240
is 10 to the sixth power. Now we're asking the question, what power do we raise 10 to to get

04:35:27.240 --> 04:35:32.920
a million? So that is what power do we raise 10 to to get 10 to the sixth? Well, of course,

04:35:32.920 --> 04:35:42.840
the answer is going to be six. Similarly, since point 001 is 10 to the minus three,

04:35:43.800 --> 04:35:49.720
this log expression is the same thing as asking what's log base 10 of 10 to the minus three.

04:35:50.360 --> 04:35:56.440
Well, what power do you have to raise 10 to to get 10 to the minus three? Of course, the answer

04:35:56.440 --> 04:36:05.800
is negative three. log base 10 of zero is asking, what power do we raise 10 to to get zero?

04:36:07.160 --> 04:36:11.880
Well, if you think about it, there's no way to raise 10 to an exponent to get zero.

04:36:11.880 --> 04:36:15.560
Raising 10 to a positive exponent gets us really big positive numbers.

04:36:16.280 --> 04:36:21.560
Raising 10 to a negative exponent is like one over 10 to a power. So that's giving us

04:36:21.560 --> 04:36:26.040
tiny fractions, but there's still positive numbers, we're never going to get zero.

04:36:27.080 --> 04:36:32.600
Even if we raise 10 to the zero power, we'll just get one. So there's no way to get zero. And the

04:36:32.600 --> 04:36:38.920
log base 10 of zero does not exist. If you tried on your calculator using the log base 10 button,

04:36:38.920 --> 04:36:44.840
you'll get an error message. Same thing happens when we do log base 10 of negative 100, we're

04:36:44.840 --> 04:36:49.640
asking 10 to what power equals negative 100. And there's no exponent that will work.

04:36:51.640 --> 04:36:55.240
And more generally, it's possible to take the log of numbers that are

04:36:55.880 --> 04:37:01.400
greater than zero, but not for numbers that are less than or equal to zero.

04:37:02.200 --> 04:37:07.960
In other words, the domain of the function log base a of x, no matter what base you're using for

04:37:07.960 --> 04:37:16.920
a, the domain is going to be all positive numbers. A few notes on notation. When you see ln of x,

04:37:16.920 --> 04:37:23.800
that's called natural log, and it means the log base e of x, where e is that famous number that's

04:37:23.800 --> 04:37:33.160
about 2.718. When you see log of x with no base at all, by convention, that means log base 10 of x,

04:37:33.160 --> 04:37:40.120
and it's called the common log. Most scientific calculators have buttons for natural log and for

04:37:40.120 --> 04:37:48.360
common log. Let's practice rewriting expressions with logs in them. log base three of one ninth

04:37:48.360 --> 04:37:55.960
is negative two can be rewritten as the expression three to the negative two equals one ninth.

04:37:58.760 --> 04:38:06.600
log of 13 is shorthand for log base 10 of 13. So that can be rewritten as 10

04:38:07.240 --> 04:38:18.520
to the 1.11394 equals 13. Finally, in this last expression, ln means natural log or log base e.

04:38:18.520 --> 04:38:26.200
So I can rewrite this equation as log base e of one over e equals negative one. Well, that means

04:38:26.200 --> 04:38:34.760
the same thing as e to the negative one equals one over e, which is true. Now let's go the opposite

04:38:34.760 --> 04:38:42.200
direction. We'll start with exponential equations and rewrite them as logs. Remember that log base

04:38:42.200 --> 04:38:51.400
a of b equals c means the same thing as a to the c equals b. The base stays the same in both

04:38:51.400 --> 04:38:59.240
expressions. So for this example, the base of three in the exponential equation is going to be the

04:38:59.240 --> 04:39:04.760
same as the base in our log. Now I just have to figure out what's in the argument of the log

04:39:05.400 --> 04:39:11.800
and what goes on the other side of the equal sign. Remember that the answer to a log is an exponent.

04:39:12.760 --> 04:39:18.120
So the thing that goes in this box should be my exponent for my exponential equation. In other

04:39:18.120 --> 04:39:30.920
words, you and I'll put the 9.78 as the argument of my log. This works because log base three of

04:39:30.920 --> 04:39:39.480
9.78 equals you means the same thing as three to the you equals 9.78, which is just what we started

04:39:39.480 --> 04:39:48.040
with. In a second example, the base of my exponential equation is e. So the base of my log is going to

04:39:48.040 --> 04:39:56.280
be e. The answer to my log is an exponent. In this case, the exponent three x plus seven.

04:39:58.920 --> 04:40:06.840
And the other expression, the four minus y becomes my argument of my log. Let me check

04:40:08.360 --> 04:40:15.240
log base e of four minus y equals three x plus seven means e to the three x plus seven equals four

04:40:15.240 --> 04:40:21.720
minus y, which is just what I started with. I can also rewrite log base e as natural log.

04:40:24.440 --> 04:40:30.760
This video introduced the idea of logs and the fact that log base a of b equals c

04:40:31.800 --> 04:40:41.320
means the same thing as a to the c equals b. So log base a of b is asking the question

04:40:41.960 --> 04:40:46.440
what power or exponent do you raise a to in order to get b?

04:40:48.760 --> 04:40:53.560
In this video, we'll work out the graphs of some log functions and also talk about their domains.

04:40:55.240 --> 04:41:00.520
For this first example, let's graph a log function by hand by plotting some points.

04:41:01.640 --> 04:41:08.280
The function we're working with is y equals log base two of x. I'll make a chart of x and y values.

04:41:09.240 --> 04:41:12.680
Since we're working this out by hand, I want to pick x values

04:41:12.680 --> 04:41:19.240
for which it's easy to compute log base two of x. So I'll start out with the x value of one

04:41:19.240 --> 04:41:24.920
because log base two of one is zero, log base anything of one is zero.

04:41:26.840 --> 04:41:33.400
Two is another x value that's easy to compute log base two of two, that's asking what power do I

04:41:33.400 --> 04:41:37.240
raise two to to get two? Well, and the answer is one.

04:41:39.160 --> 04:41:46.680
Other powers of two are easy to work with. So for example, log base two of four, that's saying

04:41:46.680 --> 04:41:53.640
what power do I raise two to to get four? So the answer is two. Similarly, log base two of eight

04:41:53.640 --> 04:42:01.320
is three, and log base two of 16 is four. Let me also work with some fractional values for x.

04:42:02.120 --> 04:42:09.640
If x is one half, then log base two of one half, that's saying what power do I raise two to

04:42:09.640 --> 04:42:16.440
to get one half? Well, that needs a power of negative one. It's also easy to compute by hand

04:42:17.480 --> 04:42:25.000
the log base two of one fourth and one eighth log base two of one fourth is negative two since

04:42:25.640 --> 04:42:33.480
two to the negative two is one fourth. And similarly, log base two of one eighth is negative three.

04:42:34.280 --> 04:42:39.720
I'll put some tick marks on my x and y axes. Please pause the video and take a moment to

04:42:39.720 --> 04:42:49.320
plot these points. Let's see, I have the point one zero. That's here to one. That's here for two.

04:42:50.280 --> 04:42:59.720
That is here. And then eight three, which is here. And the fractional x values one half goes

04:42:59.720 --> 04:43:06.520
with negative one, and one fourth with negative two, one eighth with negative three. And if I

04:43:06.520 --> 04:43:12.840
connect the dots, I get a graph that looks something like this. If I had smaller and smaller

04:43:12.840 --> 04:43:18.360
fractions, I would keep getting more and more negative answers when I took log base two of

04:43:18.360 --> 04:43:24.360
them. So my graph is getting more and more negative, my y values are getting more and more negative

04:43:25.160 --> 04:43:30.760
as x is getting close to zero. Now I didn't draw any parts of the graph over here with

04:43:30.760 --> 04:43:37.080
negative x values, and I didn't put any negative x values in my chart. That omission is is no accident

04:43:37.080 --> 04:43:44.040
because if you try to take the log base two or base anything of a negative number, like say negative

04:43:44.600 --> 04:43:52.200
four or something, there's no answer. This doesn't exist because there's no power that you can raise

04:43:52.840 --> 04:44:00.920
two two to get a negative number. So there are no points on the graph for negative x values. And

04:44:00.920 --> 04:44:07.720
similarly, there are no points on the graph where x is zero, because you can't take log base two of

04:44:07.720 --> 04:44:15.080
zero, there's no power you can raise two to to get zero. I want to observe some key features of

04:44:15.080 --> 04:44:24.280
this graph. First of all, the domain is x values greater than zero. In interval notation, I can

04:44:24.280 --> 04:44:32.760
write that as a round bracket because I don't want to include zero to infinity. The range is going to

04:44:32.760 --> 04:44:39.800
be the y values. Well, they go all the way down into the far reach of the negative numbers. And the

04:44:39.800 --> 04:44:46.840
graph gradually increases y values getting bigger and bigger. So the range is actually all real numbers

04:44:48.280 --> 04:44:53.320
or an interval notation negative infinity to infinity. Finally, I want to point out that

04:44:53.320 --> 04:45:04.760
this graph has a vertical asymptote at the y axis, that is at the line x equals zero.

04:45:06.040 --> 04:45:11.880
I'll draw that on my graph with a dotted line. A vertical asymptote is a line that

04:45:11.880 --> 04:45:18.920
our functions graph gets closer and closer to. So this is the graph of y equals log base two of x.

04:45:18.920 --> 04:45:27.800
But if I wanted to graph say, y equals log base 10 of x, it would look very similar. It would still

04:45:27.800 --> 04:45:33.800
have a domain of x values greater than zero, a range of all real numbers, and a vertical asymptote

04:45:33.800 --> 04:45:40.840
at the y axis. It would still go through the point one zero, but it would go through the point 10 one

04:45:41.480 --> 04:45:51.000
instead, because log base 10 of 10 is one. It would look pretty much the same, just a lot flatter

04:45:51.000 --> 04:45:57.960
over here. But even though it doesn't look like it with the way I've drawn it, it still gradually

04:45:57.960 --> 04:46:08.360
goes up to and towards infinity. In fact, the graph of y equals log base any a of x for a bigger than

04:46:08.360 --> 04:46:16.280
one looks pretty much the same, and has the same three properties. Now that we know what the basic

04:46:16.280 --> 04:46:21.240
log graph looks like, we can plot at least rough graphs of other log functions without plotting

04:46:21.240 --> 04:46:28.120
points. Here we have the graph of natural log of x plus five. And again, I'm just going to draw a

04:46:28.120 --> 04:46:32.200
rough graph. If I did want to do a more accurate graph, I probably would want to plot some points.

04:46:32.840 --> 04:46:41.000
But I know that roughly a log graph, if it was just like y equals ln of x, that would look something

04:46:41.000 --> 04:46:48.360
like this, and it would go through the point one zero with a vertical asymptote along the y axis.

04:46:49.560 --> 04:46:56.120
Now if I want to graph ln of x plus five, that just shifts our graph up by five units. It'll still

04:46:56.120 --> 04:47:00.920
have the same vertical asymptote since a vertical line shifted up by five units is still a vertical

04:47:00.920 --> 04:47:08.280
line. But instead of going through one zero, it'll go through the point one five. So I'll draw a rough

04:47:08.280 --> 04:47:17.640
sketch here. Let's compare our starting function, y equals ln x, and the transformed version,

04:47:17.640 --> 04:47:25.240
y equals ln x plus five, in terms of the domain, the range, and the vertical asymptote.

04:47:25.480 --> 04:47:34.360
Our original function, y equals ln x had a domain of zero to infinity. Since adding five on the

04:47:34.360 --> 04:47:41.960
outside affects the y values, and the domain is the x values, this transformation doesn't change

04:47:41.960 --> 04:47:50.360
the domain. So the domain is still from zero to infinity. Now the range of our original y equals

04:47:50.360 --> 04:47:57.560
ln x was from negative infinity to infinity. Shifting up by five does affect the y values,

04:47:57.560 --> 04:48:03.320
and the range is talking about the y values. But since the original range was all real numbers,

04:48:03.320 --> 04:48:08.040
if you add five to all set of all real numbers, you still get the set of all real numbers. So in

04:48:08.040 --> 04:48:14.440
this case, the range doesn't change either. And finally, we already saw that the original vertical

04:48:14.440 --> 04:48:20.520
asymptote of the y axis x equals zero, when we shift that up by five units, it's still the vertical

04:48:20.520 --> 04:48:28.920
line x equals zero. In this next example, we're starting with a log base 10 function. And since

04:48:28.920 --> 04:48:37.000
the plus two is on the inside, that means we shift that graph left by two. So I'll draw our basic log

04:48:37.320 --> 04:48:44.920
function. Here's our basic log function. So I'll think of that as y equals log of x going

04:48:44.920 --> 04:48:51.880
through the point one zero. Here's its vertical asymptote. Now I need to shift everything left

04:48:51.880 --> 04:49:00.600
by two. So my vertical asymptote shifts left. And now it's at the line x equals negative two instead

04:49:01.080 --> 04:49:10.120
of at x equals zero. And my graph, well, let's see my point one zero gets shifted to, let's say

04:49:10.120 --> 04:49:18.920
negative one zero, since I'm subtracting two from the x's. And here's a rough sketch of the resulting

04:49:18.920 --> 04:49:28.600
graph. Let's compare the features of the two graphs drawn here. We're talking about domains. The

04:49:28.600 --> 04:49:36.920
original had a domain of from zero to infinity. But now I've shifted that left. So I've subtracted

04:49:36.920 --> 04:49:42.120
two from all my x values. And here's my new domain, which I can also verify just by looking at the

04:49:42.120 --> 04:49:50.920
picture. My range was originally from negative infinity to infinity. Well, shifting left only

04:49:50.920 --> 04:49:55.480
affects the x value. So it doesn't even affect the range. So my range is still negative infinity

04:49:55.640 --> 04:50:03.160
to infinity. My vertical asymptote was originally at x equals zero. And since I subtract two from

04:50:03.160 --> 04:50:09.160
all my x values, that shifts it to x equals negative two. In this last problem, I'm not

04:50:09.160 --> 04:50:14.920
going to worry about drawing this graph. I'll just use algebra to compute its domain. So let's

04:50:14.920 --> 04:50:20.760
think about what's the issue when you're taking the logs of things? Well, you can't take the log

04:50:20.760 --> 04:50:27.160
of a negative number or zero. So whatever's inside the argument of the log function, whatever's

04:50:27.160 --> 04:50:35.640
being fed into log had better be greater than zero. So I'll write that down. We need two minus three x

04:50:35.640 --> 04:50:41.560
to be greater than zero. Now it's a matter of solving an inequality. Two has got to be greater

04:50:41.560 --> 04:50:48.360
than three x. So two thirds is greater than x. In other words, x has to be less than two thirds.

04:50:48.360 --> 04:50:55.720
So our domain is all the x values from negative infinity to two thirds, not including two thirds.

04:50:57.080 --> 04:51:01.880
It's a good idea to memorize the basic shape of the graph of a log function.

04:51:03.960 --> 04:51:09.480
It looks something like this goes through the point one zero and has a vertical asymptote

04:51:09.480 --> 04:51:14.120
on the y axis. Also, if you remember that you can't take the log

04:51:14.360 --> 04:51:22.520
of a negative number or zero, then that helps you quickly compute domains for log functions.

04:51:24.680 --> 04:51:29.560
Whatever's inside the log function, you set that greater than zero and solve.

04:51:33.080 --> 04:51:38.760
This video is about combining functions by adding them, subtracting them, multiplying them, and

04:51:38.760 --> 04:51:45.960
dividing them. Suppose we have two functions f of x equals x plus one and g of x equals x squared.

04:51:47.320 --> 04:51:55.560
One way to combine them is by adding them together. This notation f plus g of x means the function

04:51:55.560 --> 04:52:05.400
defined by taking f of x and adding it to g of x. So for our functions, that means we take x plus one

04:52:05.400 --> 04:52:11.400
and add x squared. I can rearrange that as the function x squared plus x plus one.

04:52:13.000 --> 04:52:19.800
So f plus g evaluated on x means x squared plus x plus one.

04:52:20.760 --> 04:52:28.280
And if I wanted to evaluate f plus g on the number two, that would be two squared plus two plus one

04:52:28.280 --> 04:52:38.280
or seven. Similarly, the notation f minus g of x means the function we get by taking f of x and

04:52:38.280 --> 04:52:45.080
subtracting g of x. So that would be x plus one minus x squared. And if I wanted to take

04:52:45.800 --> 04:52:54.680
f minus g evaluated at one, that would be one plus one minus one squared or one.

04:52:55.880 --> 04:53:02.520
The notation f dot g of x, which is sometimes also written just as f g of x,

04:53:03.080 --> 04:53:11.800
that means we take f of x times g of x. In other words, x plus one times x squared,

04:53:11.800 --> 04:53:15.080
which could be simplified as x cube plus x squared.

04:53:16.920 --> 04:53:27.080
The notation f divided by g of x means I take f of x and divide it by g of x. So that would be x

04:53:27.080 --> 04:53:37.080
plus one divided by x squared. In this figure, the blue graph represents h of x. And the red

04:53:37.080 --> 04:53:43.480
graph represents the function p of x. We're asked to find h minus p of zero.

04:53:45.720 --> 04:53:50.600
We don't have any equations to work with, but that's okay. We know that for any x,

04:53:51.160 --> 04:54:00.040
h minus p of x is defined as h of x minus p of x. So for x equals zero, h minus p of zero

04:54:00.040 --> 04:54:06.760
is going to be h of zero minus p of zero. Using the graph, we can find h of zero

04:54:07.560 --> 04:54:15.240
by finding the value of zero on the x axis and finding the corresponding y value for the function

04:54:15.240 --> 04:54:25.240
h of x. So that's about 1.8. Now p of zero, we can find similarly by looking for zero on the x axis

04:54:25.240 --> 04:54:30.440
and finding the corresponding y value for the function p of x. And that's a y value of one.

04:54:31.800 --> 04:54:38.680
1.8 minus one is 0.8. So that's our approximate value for h minus p of zero.

04:54:40.680 --> 04:54:48.920
If we want to find p times h of negative three, again, we can rewrite that as p of negative three

04:54:48.920 --> 04:54:55.800
times h of negative three. And using the graphs, we see that for an x value of negative three,

04:54:55.800 --> 04:55:06.600
the y value for p is two. And the x value of negative three corresponds to a y value of negative

04:55:06.600 --> 04:55:14.920
two for h. Two times negative two is negative four. So that's our value for p times h of negative

04:55:14.920 --> 04:55:22.200
three. In this video, we saw how to add two functions, subtract two functions, multiply two

04:55:22.200 --> 04:55:31.240
functions, and divide two functions in the following way. When you compose two functions,

04:55:31.880 --> 04:55:39.080
you apply the first function. And then you apply the second function to the output of the first

04:55:39.080 --> 04:55:47.000
function. For example, the first function might compute population size from time in years.

04:55:47.960 --> 04:55:54.680
So its input would be time in years, since a certain date, and its output would be

04:55:54.680 --> 04:56:03.160
number of people in the population. The second function g might compute healthcare costs

04:56:03.880 --> 04:56:11.800
as a function of population size. So it will take population size as input, and its output

04:56:11.800 --> 04:56:18.360
will be healthcare costs. If you put these functions together, that is, compose them,

04:56:18.360 --> 04:56:25.000
then you'll go all the way from time in years to healthcare costs. This is your composition,

04:56:25.720 --> 04:56:33.720
g composed with f. The composition of two functions, written g with a little circle

04:56:33.720 --> 04:56:43.560
f of x, is defined as follows. g composed with f of x is g evaluated on f of x.

04:56:44.600 --> 04:56:51.000
We can think of it schematically in this diagram. f acts on a number x and produces

04:56:51.000 --> 04:57:00.520
a number f of x. Then g takes that output f of x and produces a new number g of f of x.

04:57:01.800 --> 04:57:06.680
Our composition of functions g composed with f is the function that goes all the way from x

04:57:07.320 --> 04:57:14.920
to g of f of x. Let's work out some examples where our functions are defined by tables of values.

04:57:15.880 --> 04:57:24.840
If we want to find g composed with f of four, by definition, this means g of f of four.

04:57:25.800 --> 04:57:32.520
To evaluate this expression, we always work from the inside out. So we start with the x value of four

04:57:33.160 --> 04:57:39.880
and we find f of four using the table of values for f of x. When x equals four,

04:57:40.840 --> 04:57:46.760
f of x is seven. So we can replace f of four with the number seven.

04:57:47.960 --> 04:57:55.400
Now we need to evaluate g of seven. Seven becomes our new x value in our table of values for g.

04:57:56.280 --> 04:58:04.040
The x value of seven corresponds to the g of x value of ten. So g of seven is equal to ten.

04:58:04.360 --> 04:58:12.360
We found that g composed with f of four is equal to ten. If instead we want to find f composed with g

04:58:12.360 --> 04:58:21.400
of four, well we can rewrite that as f of g of four and again work from the inside out. Now we're

04:58:21.400 --> 04:58:29.080
trying to find g of four. So four is our x value and we use our table of values for g to see that g

04:58:29.240 --> 04:58:38.440
of four is one. So we replace g of four by one and now we need to evaluate f of one. Using our

04:58:38.440 --> 04:58:49.400
table for f values, f of one is eight. Notice that when we've computed g of f of four, we got a

04:58:49.400 --> 04:58:57.480
different answer than when we computed f of g of four. And in general, g composed with f is not the

04:58:58.280 --> 04:59:04.280
same thing as f composed with g. Please pause the video and take a moment to compute the next two

04:59:04.280 --> 04:59:12.840
examples. We can replace f composed with f of two by the equivalent expression f of f of two.

04:59:13.800 --> 04:59:21.720
Working from the inside out, we know that f of two is three and f of three is six.

04:59:22.040 --> 04:59:30.040
If we want to find f composed with g of six, rewrite that as f of g of six using the table

04:59:30.040 --> 04:59:41.880
for g, g of six is eight. But f of eight, eight is not on the table as an x value for the for the f

04:59:41.880 --> 04:59:50.360
function. And so there is no f of eight. This does not exist. We can say that six is not

04:59:50.600 --> 05:00:02.120
in the domain for f composed with g. Even though it was in the domain of g, we couldn't follow all

05:00:02.120 --> 05:00:09.000
the way through and get a value for f composed with g of six. Next, let's turn our attention to

05:00:09.000 --> 05:00:15.960
the composition of functions that are given by equations. p of x is x squared plus x and q of

05:00:15.960 --> 05:00:24.600
x is negative two x. We want to find q composed with p of one. As usual, I can rewrite this as q

05:00:24.600 --> 05:00:35.320
of p of one and work from the inside out. p of one is one squared plus one. So that's two.

05:00:36.200 --> 05:00:44.760
So this is the same thing as q of two. But q of two is negative two times two or negative four.

05:00:44.760 --> 05:00:51.480
So this evaluates to negative four. In this next example, we want to find q composed with p of some

05:00:51.480 --> 05:01:01.880
arbitrary x. I'll rewrite it as usual as q of p of x and work from the inside out. Well, p of x,

05:01:02.440 --> 05:01:09.000
we know the formula for that, that's x squared plus x. So I can replace my p of x with that

05:01:09.000 --> 05:01:18.520
expression. Now, I'm stuck with evaluating q on x squared plus x. Well, q of anything is negative

05:01:18.520 --> 05:01:26.920
two times that thing. So q of x squared plus x is going to be negative two times the quantity

05:01:26.920 --> 05:01:33.080
x squared plus x. What I've done is I've substituted in the whole expression x squared plus x,

05:01:33.160 --> 05:01:39.160
where I saw the x in this formula for q of x. It's important to use the parentheses here so

05:01:39.160 --> 05:01:43.800
that we'll be multiplying negative two by the whole expression and not just by the first piece.

05:01:44.680 --> 05:01:50.760
I can simplify this a bit as negative two x squared minus two x. And that's my expression

05:01:51.320 --> 05:01:58.440
for q composed with p of x. Notice that if I wanted to compute q composed with p of one,

05:01:59.400 --> 05:02:05.080
which I already did in the first problem, I could just use this expression now negative two times

05:02:05.080 --> 05:02:12.920
one squared minus two, and I get negative four, just like I did before. Let's try another one.

05:02:12.920 --> 05:02:21.240
Let's try p composed with q of x. First, I read write this p of q of x working from the inside

05:02:21.240 --> 05:02:27.880
out, I can replace q of x with negative two x. So I need to compute p of negative two x.

05:02:29.400 --> 05:02:36.200
Here's my formula for p to compute p of this expression, I need to plug in this expression

05:02:36.200 --> 05:02:45.800
everywhere I see an x in the formula for p. So that means negative two x squared plus negative

05:02:45.800 --> 05:02:51.080
two x. Again, being careful to use parentheses to make sure I plug in the entire expression

05:02:51.640 --> 05:03:01.160
in for x. Let me simplify, this is four x squared minus two x. Notice that I got different expressions

05:03:01.720 --> 05:03:11.720
for q of p of x, and for p of q of x. Once again, we see that q composed with p is not

05:03:11.720 --> 05:03:19.000
necessarily equal to p composed with q. Please pause the video and try this last example yourself.

05:03:19.880 --> 05:03:29.800
Rewriting and working from the inside out, we can replace p of x with its expression x squared

05:03:29.800 --> 05:03:39.400
plus x. And then we need to evaluate p on x squared plus x. That means we plug in x squared plus x

05:03:40.120 --> 05:03:45.960
everywhere we see an x in this formula. So that's x squared plus x quantity squared plus

05:03:46.600 --> 05:03:53.960
x squared plus x. Once again, I can simplify by distributing out that gives me x to the fourth

05:03:53.960 --> 05:04:03.320
plus two x cubed plus x squared plus x squared plus x or x to the fourth plus two x cubed plus

05:04:03.320 --> 05:04:11.400
two x squared plus x. In this last set of examples, we're asked to go backwards. We're given a formula

05:04:11.400 --> 05:04:18.120
for a function of h of x, but we're supposed to rewrite h of x as a composition of two functions

05:04:18.120 --> 05:04:24.200
f and g. Let's think for a minute, which of these two functions gets applied first?

05:04:24.840 --> 05:04:33.320
f composed with g of x, let's see, that means f of g of x. And since we evaluate these expressions

05:04:33.320 --> 05:04:41.720
from the inside out, we must be applying g first, and then f. In order to figure out what

05:04:41.720 --> 05:04:48.200
f and g could be, I like to draw a box around something inside my expression for h. So I'm

05:04:48.200 --> 05:04:54.040
going to draw a box around x squared plus seven. Then whatever's inside the box, that'll be my

05:04:54.040 --> 05:04:59.720
function g of x the first function that gets applied. Whatever happens to the box, in this case

05:04:59.720 --> 05:05:07.880
taking the square root sign, that becomes my outside function, my second function f. So here,

05:05:07.880 --> 05:05:15.320
we're going to say g of x is equal to x squared plus seven. And f of x is equal to the square root

05:05:15.320 --> 05:05:21.400
of x. Let's just check and make sure that this works. So I need to check that when I take the

05:05:21.400 --> 05:05:31.240
composition, f composed with g, I need to get the same thing as my original h. So let's see,

05:05:31.240 --> 05:05:39.880
if I do f composed with g of x, well by definition, that's f of g of x, working from the inside out,

05:05:39.880 --> 05:05:46.600
I can replace g of x with its formula x squared plus seven. So I need to evaluate f of x squared

05:05:46.600 --> 05:05:55.800
plus seven. That means I plug in x squared plus seven into the formula for for f. So that becomes

05:05:55.800 --> 05:06:01.720
the square root of x squared plus seven. Tada, it works because it matches my original equation.

05:06:02.680 --> 05:06:07.800
So we found a correct answer, a correct way of breaking h down as a composition of two functions.

05:06:07.800 --> 05:06:14.200
But I do want to point out, this is not the only correct answer. I'll write down my formula for h

05:06:14.280 --> 05:06:19.880
of x again. And this time I'll put the box in a different place. I'll just box the x squared.

05:06:20.680 --> 05:06:30.440
If I did that, then my inside function, my first function g of x would be x squared. And my second

05:06:30.440 --> 05:06:38.680
function is what happens to the box. So my f of x is what happens to the box. And the box gets

05:06:39.320 --> 05:06:45.320
added seven to it and taken the square root. So in other words, f of x is going to be

05:06:46.120 --> 05:06:53.640
the square root of x plus seven. Again, I can check that this works. If I do f composed with

05:06:53.640 --> 05:07:01.560
g of x, that's f of g of x. So now g of x is x squared. So I'm taking f of x squared. When I

05:07:01.560 --> 05:07:07.880
plug in x squared for x, I do in fact get the square root of x squared plus seven. So this is

05:07:07.880 --> 05:07:15.960
an alternative correct solution. In this video, we learned to evaluate the composition of functions

05:07:16.920 --> 05:07:24.520
by rewriting it and working from the inside out. We also learned to break apart a complicated

05:07:24.520 --> 05:07:33.000
function into a composition of two functions by boxing one piece of the function. And letting

05:07:33.000 --> 05:07:38.760
the first function applied in the composition, let that be the inside of the box. And the second

05:07:38.760 --> 05:07:41.960
function applied in the composition be whatever happens to the box.

05:07:42.360 --> 05:07:59.000
The inverse of a function undoes what the function does. So the inverse of tying your shoes would

05:07:59.000 --> 05:08:07.640
be to untie them. And the inverse of the function that adds two to a number would be the function

05:08:07.640 --> 05:08:13.480
that subtracts two from a number. This video introduces inverses and their properties.

05:08:14.600 --> 05:08:20.840
Suppose f of x is the function defined by this chart. In other words, f of two is three,

05:08:20.840 --> 05:08:29.320
f of three is five, f of four is six, and f of five is one. The inverse function for f,

05:08:29.320 --> 05:08:37.400
written f superscript negative one x undoes what f does. Since f takes two to three,

05:08:38.520 --> 05:08:46.440
f inverse takes three back to two. So we write this f superscript negative one of three is two.

05:08:48.360 --> 05:08:55.560
Similarly, since f takes three to five, f inverse takes five to three.

05:08:56.120 --> 05:09:04.840
And since f takes four to six, f inverse of six is four. And since f takes five to one,

05:09:04.840 --> 05:09:12.200
f inverse of one is five. I'll use these numbers to fill in the chart. Notice that the chart of

05:09:12.200 --> 05:09:19.080
values when y equals f of x and the chart of values when y equals f inverse of x are closely

05:09:19.960 --> 05:09:27.480
related. They share the same numbers, but the x values for f of x correspond to the y values

05:09:27.480 --> 05:09:34.840
for f inverse of x. And the y values for f of x correspond to the x values for f inverse of x.

05:09:35.800 --> 05:09:41.080
That leads us to the first key fact. Inverse functions reverse the roles of y and x.

05:09:41.560 --> 05:09:49.160
I'm going to plot the points for y equals f of x in blue. Next, I'll plot the points for y equals f

05:09:49.160 --> 05:09:55.480
inverse of x in red. Pause the video for a moment and see what kind of symmetry you observe in this

05:09:55.480 --> 05:10:01.160
graph. How are the blue points related to the red points? You might have noticed that the blue

05:10:01.160 --> 05:10:09.880
points and the red points are mirror images over the mirror line y equals x. So our second key fact

05:10:10.520 --> 05:10:16.920
is that the graph of y equals f inverse of x can be obtained from the graph of y equals f of x by

05:10:16.920 --> 05:10:25.800
reflecting over the line y equals x. This makes sense because inverses reverse the roles of y and x.

05:10:27.560 --> 05:10:34.920
In this same example, let's compute f inverse of f of two. This open circle means composition. In

05:10:35.320 --> 05:10:43.160
other words, we're computing f inverse of f of two. We compute this from the inside out. So that's

05:10:43.160 --> 05:10:57.800
f inverse of three, since f of two is three, and f inverse of three, we see as two. Similarly, we can

05:10:57.880 --> 05:11:08.760
compute f of f inverse of three. And that means we take f of f inverse of three. Since f inverse

05:11:08.760 --> 05:11:18.600
of three is two, that's the same thing as computing f of two, which is three. Please pause the video

05:11:18.600 --> 05:11:28.840
for a moment and compute these other compositions. You should have found that in every case, if you

05:11:28.840 --> 05:11:35.240
take f inverse of f of a number, you get back to the very same number you started with. And similarly,

05:11:35.240 --> 05:11:40.120
if you take f of f inverse of any number, you get back to the same number you started with.

05:11:40.360 --> 05:11:49.560
So in general, f inverse of f of x is equal to x, and f of f inverse of x is also equal to x. This

05:11:49.560 --> 05:11:56.040
is the mathematical way of saying that f and f inverse undo each other. Let's look at a different

05:11:56.040 --> 05:12:02.760
example. Suppose that f of x is x cubed. Pause the video for a moment and guess what the inverse

05:12:02.840 --> 05:12:08.360
of f should be. Remember, f inverse undoes the work that f does.

05:12:11.400 --> 05:12:18.120
You might have guessed that f inverse of x is going to be the cube root function. Now we can

05:12:18.120 --> 05:12:26.440
check that this is true by looking at f of f inverse of x, that's f of the cube root of function,

05:12:26.440 --> 05:12:33.720
which means the cube root function cubed, which gets us back to x. Similarly, if we compute f

05:12:33.720 --> 05:12:42.280
inverse of f of x, that's the cube root of x cubed, and we get back to x again. So the cube

05:12:42.280 --> 05:12:47.640
root function really is the inverse of the cubing function. When we compose the two functions,

05:12:47.640 --> 05:12:55.160
we get back to the number that we started with. It'd be nice to have a more systematic way of

05:12:55.240 --> 05:13:02.840
finding inverses of functions besides guessing and checking. One method uses the fact that inverses

05:13:02.840 --> 05:13:09.080
reverse the roles of y and x. So if we want to find the inverse of the function f of x equals

05:13:09.080 --> 05:13:17.880
five minus x over three x, we can write it as y equals five minus x over three x. Reverse the

05:13:17.880 --> 05:13:28.840
roles of y and x to get x equals five minus y over three y, and then solve for y. To solve for y,

05:13:28.840 --> 05:13:37.080
let's multiply both sides by three y. Bring all terms with y's in them to the left side,

05:13:37.640 --> 05:13:42.760
and all terms without y's in them to the right side. Factor out the y

05:13:43.240 --> 05:13:56.040
and divide to isolate y. This gives us f inverse of x as five over three x plus one.

05:13:57.640 --> 05:14:03.880
Notice that our original function f and our inverse function f inverse are both rational

05:14:03.880 --> 05:14:10.760
functions, but they're not the reciprocals of each other. And in general, f inverse of x is not

05:14:10.760 --> 05:14:19.240
usually equal to one over f of x. This can be confusing, because when we write two to the minus

05:14:19.240 --> 05:14:27.080
one, that does mean one over two. But f to the minus one of x means the inverse function and not

05:14:27.080 --> 05:14:34.840
the reciprocal. It's natural to ask if all functions have inverse functions. That is, for any

05:14:34.840 --> 05:14:42.280
function you might encounter, is there always a function that is its inverse? In fact, the answer

05:14:42.280 --> 05:14:50.120
is no. See if you can come up with an example of a function that does not have an inverse function.

05:14:51.560 --> 05:14:57.720
The word function here is key. Remember that a function is a relationship between x values and

05:14:57.800 --> 05:15:07.320
y values, such that for each x value in the domain, there's only one corresponding y value.

05:15:10.440 --> 05:15:18.040
One example of a function that does not have an inverse function is the function f of x equals x

05:15:18.040 --> 05:15:27.320
squared. To see that the inverse of this function is not a function, note that for the x squared

05:15:27.320 --> 05:15:36.920
function, the number two and the number negative two both go to number four. So if I had an inverse,

05:15:37.800 --> 05:15:44.520
it would have to send four to both two and negative two. The inverse would not be a function.

05:15:45.960 --> 05:15:50.920
It might be easier to understand the problem when you look at a graph of y equals x squared.

05:15:50.920 --> 05:16:01.480
Recall that inverse functions reverse the roles of y and x and flip the graph over the line y equals

05:16:01.480 --> 05:16:09.240
x. But when I flip the green graph over the line y equals x, I get this red graph. This red graph

05:16:09.240 --> 05:16:14.680
is not the graph of a function because it violates the vertical line test. The reason

05:16:14.680 --> 05:16:20.200
that violates the vertical line test is because the original green function violates the horizontal

05:16:20.200 --> 05:16:30.520
line test and has two x values with the same y value. In general, a function f has an inverse

05:16:30.520 --> 05:16:36.600
function if and only if the graph of f satisfies the horizontal line test, i.e. every horizontal line

05:16:36.600 --> 05:16:42.840
intersects the graph in at most one point. Pause the video for a moment and see which of these

05:16:42.840 --> 05:16:49.080
four graphs satisfy the horizontal line test. In other words, which of the four corresponding

05:16:49.080 --> 05:16:56.520
functions would have an inverse function? You may have found that graphs A and B

05:16:57.480 --> 05:17:02.600
violate the horizontal line test. So their functions would not have inverse functions.

05:17:03.320 --> 05:17:10.200
But graphs C and D satisfy the horizontal line test. So these graphs represent functions that

05:17:10.200 --> 05:17:16.920
do have inverses. Functions that satisfy the horizontal line test are sometimes called

05:17:16.920 --> 05:17:25.400
one-to-one functions. Equivalently, a function is one-to-one if for any two different x values,

05:17:26.200 --> 05:17:34.760
x1 and x2, the y values f of x1 and f of x2 are different numbers. Sometimes as I said,

05:17:35.320 --> 05:17:44.680
f is one-to-one if whenever f of x1 is equal to f of x2, then x1 has to equal x2.

05:17:44.920 --> 05:17:52.200
As our last example, let's try to find p inverse of x, where p of x is the square root of x minus

05:17:52.200 --> 05:18:00.200
2 drawn here. If we graph p inverse on the same axis as p of x, we get the following graph,

05:18:01.000 --> 05:18:07.720
simply by flipping over the line y equals x. If we try to solve the problem algebraically,

05:18:08.520 --> 05:18:14.440
we can write y equal to square root of x minus 2, reverse the roles of y and x,

05:18:15.320 --> 05:18:20.200
and solve for y by squaring both sides and adding 2.

05:18:24.040 --> 05:18:30.040
Now if we were to graph y equals x squared plus 2, that would look like a parabola. It would look

05:18:30.040 --> 05:18:37.400
like the red graph we've already drawn together with another arm on the left side.

05:18:37.960 --> 05:18:43.480
But we know that our actual inverse function consists only of this right arm.

05:18:46.520 --> 05:18:54.200
We can specify this algebraically by making the restriction that x has to be bigger than or equal

05:18:54.200 --> 05:19:03.160
to zero. This corresponds to the fact that on the original graph for the square root of x, y was

05:19:03.160 --> 05:19:10.200
only greater than or equal to zero. Looking more closely at the domain and range of p and p inverse,

05:19:10.760 --> 05:19:19.400
we know that the domain of p is all values of x such that x minus 2 is greater than or equal to

05:19:19.400 --> 05:19:25.800
zero, since we can't take the square root of a negative number. This corresponds to x values

05:19:25.800 --> 05:19:31.000
being greater than or equal to 2, or an interval notation, the interval from 2 to infinity.

05:19:31.480 --> 05:19:38.200
The range of p we can see from the graph is all y values greater than or equal to 0, or the interval

05:19:38.200 --> 05:19:48.280
from 0 to infinity. Similarly, based on the graph, we see the domain of p inverse is x values greater

05:19:48.280 --> 05:19:55.880
than or equal to 0, the interval from 0 to infinity, and the range of p inverse is y values greater

05:19:56.680 --> 05:20:03.720
than or equal to 2, or the interval from 2 to infinity. If you look closely at these domains

05:20:03.720 --> 05:20:09.880
and ranges, you'll notice that the domain of p corresponds exactly to the range of p inverse,

05:20:10.440 --> 05:20:18.760
and the range of p corresponds to the domain of p inverse. This makes sense because inverse

05:20:18.760 --> 05:20:27.000
functions reverse the rules of y and x. The domain of f inverse of x is the x values for f inverse,

05:20:27.000 --> 05:20:34.840
which corresponds to the y values, or the range of f. The range of f inverse is the y values for

05:20:34.840 --> 05:20:43.880
f inverse, which correspond to the x values, or the domain of f. In this video, we discussed five

05:20:43.880 --> 05:20:50.440
key properties of inverse functions. Inverse functions reverse the roles of y and x.

05:20:52.600 --> 05:21:00.600
The graph of y equals f inverse of x is the graph of y equals f of x

05:21:01.720 --> 05:21:10.280
reflected over the line y equals x. When we compose f with f inverse, we get the identity

05:21:10.280 --> 05:21:18.600
function y equals x. And similarly, when we compose f inverse with f, that brings x to x.

05:21:18.600 --> 05:21:27.720
In other words, f and f inverse undo each other. The function f of x has an inverse function,

05:21:29.560 --> 05:21:38.600
if and only if the graph of y equals f of x satisfies the horizontal line test.

05:21:40.520 --> 05:21:54.040
And finally, the domain of f is the range of f inverse. And the range of f is the domain of f

05:21:54.040 --> 05:22:01.640
inverse. These properties of inverse functions will be important when we study exponential functions

05:22:01.640 --> 05:22:04.600
and their inverses logarithmic functions.
