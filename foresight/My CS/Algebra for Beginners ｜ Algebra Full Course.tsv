0	7200	This video is about the exponent rules, rules that govern expressions like two to the fifth
7200	9940	or x to the n.
9940	16720	Two to the fifth is just shorthand for two times two times two times two times two, written
16720	25660	five times, and similarly x to the n is just x multiplied by itself, n times.
25660	31300	When we write these expressions, the number on the bottom that's being multiplied by itself
31300	37900	is called the base, and the number at the top telling us how many times we're multiplying
37900	42180	the base by itself is called the exponent.
42180	47220	Sometimes the exponent is also called the power.
47220	54780	The product rule says that a five x to the power of n times x to the power of m, that's
54780	59540	the same thing as x to the n plus m power.
59540	71300	In other words, when I multiply two expressions with the same base, then I can add their exponents.
71300	77260	For example, if I have two cubed times two to the fourth, that's equal to two to the
77260	84020	seventh, and that makes sense because two cubed times two to the fourth means I multiply
84260	91220	two by itself three times, and then I multiply that by two multiplied by itself four times,
91220	100860	and in the end, I have two multiplied by itself seven times, which is two to the seventh.
100860	105420	I'm just adding up the number of times that's multiplied in each piece to get the number
105420	108460	of times that's multiplied total.
108460	114860	The quotient rule says that a five x to the n power divided by x to the m power, that's
114860	118500	equal to x to the n minus m power.
118500	125740	In other words, if I divide two expressions with the same base, then I can subtract their
125740	128940	exponents.
128940	134700	For example, three to the sixth divided by three squared is going to be three to the
134700	138180	six minus two, or three to the fourth.
138180	143980	And this makes sense because three to the sixth means I multiply three by itself six
143980	149580	times, and then I divide that by three multiplied by itself twice.
149580	154300	So when I cancel out threes, I have four threes left.
154300	158620	Notice that I have to subtract the number of threes on the bottom from the number of
158620	162860	threes at the top to get my number of threes remaining.
162860	166180	That's why I subtract my exponents.
166180	172300	The power rule tells us if I have x to the n power raised to the m power, that's the
172300	176860	same thing as x to the n times m power.
176860	185700	In other words, when I raise a power to a power, I get to multiply the exponents.
185700	193380	For example, five to the fourth cubed is equal to five to the four times three, or five to
193380	194700	the twelfth.
194700	200180	And this makes sense because five to the fourth cubed can be thought of as five to the fourth
200180	205740	times five to the fourth times five to the fourth, expanding this out some more.
205740	213900	That's five times five times five times five times the same thing times the same thing
213900	216180	again.
216180	227820	So I have three groups of four fives, which is a total of three times four or twelve fives.
227820	233100	The next rule involves what happens when I raise a number or a variable to the zeroth
233100	234380	power.
234380	239660	It turns out that anything to the zeroth power is equal to one.
239660	245140	Usually this is just taken as a definition, but here's why it makes sense to me.
245140	251420	If you have something like two cubed divided by two cubed, well, certainly that has to
251420	252660	equal one.
252660	255340	Anything divided by itself is just one.
255340	262660	But using the quotient rule, we know that this is the same thing as two to the three
262660	264380	minus three.
264380	270420	Because when we divide two things with the same base, we get to subtract their exponents.
270420	274420	Therefore, this is the same thing as two to the zero.
274420	281020	So two to the zero has to equal one in order to make it work with the quotient rule.
281020	287180	And the same argument shows that anything to the zero power has to be equal to one.
287180	292020	What happens when we take something to a negative power?
292020	297100	X to the n is equal to one over x to the n.
297100	302060	Again, most people just take this as a definition of a negative exponent, but here's why it
302060	304540	makes sense.
304540	310180	If I take something like five to the seventh times five to the negative seventh, then by
310180	316540	the product rule, this has to equal five to the seven plus negative seven, which is five
316540	317700	to the zero.
317700	321580	And we just said that that is equal to one.
321580	325460	Now I have the equation five to the seventh times five to the negative seventh equals
325460	326460	one.
326460	331780	If I divide both sides by five to the seventh, I get that five to the negative seventh has
331780	334660	to equal one over five to the seventh.
334660	337700	So that's where this rule about negative exponents comes from.
337700	342100	It has to be true in order to be consistent with the product rule.
342100	345700	Finally, let's look at a fractional exponent.
345700	349940	What does an expression like x to the one over n really mean?
349940	354900	Well, it means the nth root of x.
354900	362380	For example, 64 to the one third power means the cube root of 64, which happens to be four.
362380	367860	And nine to the one half means the square root of nine, which is usually written without
367860	371100	that little superscript up there.
371100	375020	Now the square root of nine is just three.
375020	377100	Fractional exponents also make sense.
377100	387140	For example, if I have five to the one third and I cube that, then by the power rule, that's
387140	394820	equal to five to the one third times three, which is just five to the one or five.
394820	400780	So in other words, five to the one third is the number that when you cube it, you get
400780	402100	five.
402100	405620	And that's exactly what's meant by the cube root of five.
405620	411740	The cube root of five is also a number that when you cube it, you get five.
411740	416900	The next rule tells us we can distribute an exponent over a product.
416900	423180	In other words, if we have a product x times y all raised to the nth power, that's equal
423180	427100	to x to the n times y to the n.
427100	434980	For example, five times seven, all raised to the third power is equal to five cubed
434980	436940	times seven cubed.
436940	443500	And this makes sense because five times seven, all raised to the cube power can be expanded
443500	449340	as five times seven times five times seven times five times seven.
449340	454260	But if I rearrange the order of multiplication, this is the same thing as five times five
454260	460780	times five times seven times seven times seven or five cubed times seven cubed.
460780	465060	Similarly, we could distribute an exponent over quotient.
465060	470700	If we have the quotient x over y, all raised to the n power, that's the same as x to the
470700	473620	n over y to the n.
473620	480060	For example, two sevenths raised to the fifth power is the same thing as two to the fifth
480060	481940	over seven to the fifth.
481940	489180	This makes sense because two sevenths to the fifth can be expanded as two sevenths multiplied
489180	496340	by itself five times, which can be written rewritten as two multiplied by itself five
496340	501100	times divided by seven multiplied by itself five times.
501100	507540	And that's two to the fifth over seven to the fifth as wanted.
507540	517220	We've seen that we can distribute an exponent over multiplication and division, but be careful
517220	524900	because we cannot distribute an exponent over addition or subtraction.
524900	533660	For example, a plus b to the n is not generally equal to a to the n plus b to the n.
533660	539460	A minus b to the n is not generally equal to a to the n minus b to the n.
539460	544580	And if you're not sure, just try an example with numbers.
544580	553140	For example, two plus three squared is not the same thing as two squared plus three squared.
553140	560660	And two minus three squared is definitely not equal to two squared minus three squared.
560660	565620	In this video, I gave eight exponent rules, which I'll list again here.
565620	574820	There's the product rule, the quotient rule, the power rule, the zero exponent, the negative
574820	584260	exponent, the fractional exponent, and there are the two rules involving distributing exponents
584260	590580	across multiplication and division.
590580	595780	In another video, I'll use these exponent rules to rewrite and simplify expressions
595780	598900	involving exponents.
598900	603380	In this video, I'll work out some examples of simplifying expressions using exponent
603380	604380	rules.
604380	608860	I'll start by reviewing the exponent rules.
608860	614860	The product rule says that when you multiply two expressions with the same base, you add
614860	616660	the exponents.
616660	622220	The quotient rule says that when you divide two expressions with the same base, you subtract
622220	623740	the exponents.
623740	631340	The power rule says that when you take a power to a power, you multiply the exponents.
631340	637540	The power of zero rule says that anything to the zero power is one as long as the base
637540	640020	is not zero.
640020	645300	Since zero to the zero is undefined, it doesn't make sense.
645300	651780	With exponents, to evaluate x to the minus n, we take the reciprocal one over x to the
651780	653420	n.
653420	659460	To evaluate a fractional exponent, like x to the one over n, we take the nth root of
659460	661720	x.
661720	669140	We can distribute an exponent over a product, a times b to the n is equal to a to the n times
669140	674420	b to the n, and we can distribute an exponent over a quotient.
674420	680140	A over b to the n is a to the n over b to the n.
680140	686580	In the rest of this video, we'll use these exponent rules to simplify expressions.
686580	692220	For our first example, we want to simplify 3 times x to the minus 2 divided by x to the
692220	693220	fourth.
693220	696460	There are several possible ways to proceed.
696460	703180	For example, we could use the negative exponent rule to write x to the minus 2 as one over
703180	704900	x squared.
704900	709260	All that gets divided by x to the fourth still.
709260	712500	Notice that we only take the reciprocal of the x squared.
712500	717260	The 3 stays where it is, and that's because the exponent of negative 2 only applies to
717260	720820	the x, not to the 3.
720820	729260	Now if we think of 3 as 3 over 1, we have a product of two fractions in our numerator,
729260	735220	and so we evaluate that by taking the product of the numerators times the product of the
735220	742140	denominators, which is 3 over x squared all divided by x to the fourth.
742140	749180	I can think of x to the fourth as x to the fourth over 1, so now I have a fraction over
749180	755500	a fraction, which I can evaluate by multiplying by the reciprocal.
755500	762620	That simplifies to 3 times 1 divided by x squared times x to the fourth, which is 3
762620	769900	over x to the sixth using the product rule, since x squared times x to the fourth is equal
769900	775460	to x to the 2 plus 4, or x to the sixth.
775460	784140	An alternate way of solving this problem is to start by using the quotient rule.
784140	790020	I can rewrite this as 3 times x to the minus 2 over x to the fourth, and by the quotient
790020	798820	rule that's 3 times x to the minus 2 minus 4, or 3 times x to the minus 6.
798820	805300	Now using the negative exponent rule, x to the minus 6 is 1 over x to the sixth, and
805300	810940	this product of fractions simplifies to 3 over x to the sixth.
810940	814140	The same answer I got before.
814140	817820	The second problem can be solved in similar ways.
817820	822420	Please pause the video and try it before going on.
822420	829020	One way to simplify would be to use the negative exponent rule first and rewrite y to the minus
829020	833420	5 as 1 over y to the fifth.
833420	843980	Using of this as a fraction divided by a fraction, I can multiply by the reciprocal
843980	851260	and get 4y cubed y to the fifth over 1 by the product rule.
851260	859380	The numerator here is 4y to the eighth, and so my final answer is just 4y to the eighth.
860020	865620	Alternatively, I could decide to use the quotient rule first.
865620	873060	As in the previous problem, I can write this as 4y cubed minus negative 5 by the quotient
873060	878020	rule, and so that's 4y to the eighth as before.
878020	883780	I'd like to show you one more method to solve these two problems, kind of a shortcut method
883780	885660	before we go on.
885660	892740	A shortcut relies on the principle that a negative exponent in the numerator corresponds
892740	896540	to a positive exponent in the denominator.
896540	903420	For example, the x to the negative 2 in the numerator here after some manipulations became
903420	907060	an x to the positive 2 in the denominator.
907900	915820	Furthermore, a negative exponent in the denominator is equivalent to a positive exponent in the
915820	919140	numerator.
919140	924020	That's what happened when we had the y to the negative 5 in the denominator and translated
924020	928540	into a y to the positive 5 in the numerator.
928540	936740	Sometimes people like to talk about this principle by saying that you can pass a factor across
937340	947460	the fraction bar by switching the sign of the exponent, that is, making a positive exponent
947460	951900	negative or a negative exponent positive.
951900	957500	Let's see how this principle gives us a shortcut for solving these two problems.
957500	965020	In the first problem, 3x to the minus 2 over x to the 4, we can move the negative exponent
965020	969340	in the numerator and make it a positive exponent in the denominator.
969340	976940	So we get 3 over x to the 4 plus 2 or x to the 6.
976940	984420	In the second example, for y cubed over y to the minus 5, we can change the y to the
984420	990780	minus 5 in the denominator into a y to the 5 in the numerator and get our final answer
990780	996460	of 4 y to the 3 plus 5 or 8.
996460	1000820	We'll use this principle again in the next problems.
1000820	1006380	In this example, notice that I have y's in the numerator and in the denominator and also
1006380	1009940	z's in the numerator and in the denominator.
1009940	1013580	In order to simplify it, I'm going to try to get all my y's either in the numerator
1013580	1017660	or the denominator and similarly for the z's.
1017660	1023900	Since I have more y's in the denominator, let me move this y to the 3 downstairs and
1023900	1026380	make it a y to the negative 3.
1026380	1033900	I'm using the principle here that a positive exponent in the numerator corresponds to a
1033900	1037420	negative exponent in the denominator.
1037420	1041340	Now since I have a positive exponent on z in the numerator and a negative exponent in
1041340	1048100	the denominator and I want to get rid of negative exponents, I'm going to pass the z's to the
1048100	1049100	numerator.
1049100	1057860	A z to the minus 2 in the denominator becomes a z to the plus 2 in the numerator.
1057860	1062660	Notice that my number 7 doesn't move when I do any of these manipulations because it
1062660	1067620	doesn't have an exponent and the exponent of negative 2, for example, only applies to
1067620	1070380	the z, not to the 7.
1070380	1074940	Now that I've got all my z's in the numerator and all my y's in the denominator, it's easy
1074940	1081660	to clean this up using the product rule and I have my simplified expression.
1081660	1087340	In this last example, we have a complicated expression raised to a fractional power.
1087340	1092460	I'm going to start by simplifying the expression inside the parentheses.
1092460	1098060	I can bring all my y's downstairs and all my x's upstairs and get rid of negative exponents
1098060	1099060	at the same time.
1099060	1106740	In other words, I can rewrite this as 25x to the fourth.
1106740	1112940	I'll bring the y to the minus 5 downstairs and make it y to the fifth on the denominator.
1112940	1119060	Bring the x to the minus 6 upstairs and make it x to the sixth, the numerator, and then
1119060	1123020	I still have the y cubed on the denominator.
1123020	1126240	All that's raised to the 3 half's power.
1126240	1130720	Using the product rule, I can rewrite the expression on the inside of the parentheses
1130720	1137080	as 25x to the tenth over y to the eighth.
1137080	1148680	Recall that we're allowed to distribute an exponent across a product or across a quotient.
1148680	1157480	When I distribute my 3 half's power, I get 25 to the 3 half's times x to the tenth to
1157480	1164120	the 3 half's divided by y to the eighth to the 3 half's.
1164120	1171000	Now the power rule tells me when I have a power to a power, I get to multiply the exponents.
1171000	1178120	So I can rewrite this as 25 to the 3 half's times x to the tenth times 3 half's over y
1178120	1180800	to the eighth times 3 half's.
1180800	1187600	In other words, 25 to the 3 half's times x to the fifteenth over y to the twelfth.
1187600	1193120	Finally, I need to rewrite 25 to the 3 half's.
1193120	1202440	As 3 half's can be thought of as 3 times 1 half or as 1 half times 3, I can write 25
1202440	1211520	to the 3 half's as 25 to the 3 times 1 half or as 25 to the 1 half times 3.
1211520	1217680	Well using the power rule in reverse, I can think of this as 25 cubed to the 1 half or
1217680	1226520	as 25 to the 1 half cubed since when I take a power to a power, I multiply the exponents.
1226520	1234040	25 cubed to the 1 half might be hard to evaluate since 25 cubed is a huge number.
1234040	1239440	But 25 to the 1 half is just the square root of 25.
1239440	1245720	So I have the square root of 25 cubed or 5 cubed which is 125.
1246080	1255840	Therefore, my original expression is going to be 125 x to the 15 over y to the twelfth.
1255840	1262560	In this video, we use the exponent rules to simplify complicated expressions.
1262560	1267800	This video goes through a few tricks for simplifying expressions with radicals in them.
1267800	1274720	Recall that this notation means the nth root of x, so this notation here means the cube
1274720	1282440	root of 8, the number that when you cube it, you get 8, that number would be 2.
1282440	1288120	When we write the root sign without a little number, that just means the square root, so
1288120	1291320	the 2 is implied.
1291320	1298640	In this case, the square root of 25 is 5 since 5 squared is 25.
1298640	1302080	Let's start by reviewing some rules for radical expressions.
1302080	1311720	First, if we have the radical of a product, we can rewrite that as the product of two radicals.
1311720	1319840	For example, the square root of 9 times 16 is the same thing as a square root of 9 times
1319840	1321880	the square root of 16.
1321880	1325800	You can check that both of these evaluate to 12.
1325800	1331880	Similarly, it's possible to distribute a radical sign across division.
1331880	1338560	The radical of a divided by b is the same thing as the radical of a divided by the radical
1338560	1340280	of b.
1340280	1348880	For example, the cube root of 64 over 8 is the same thing as the cube root of 64 over
1348880	1350800	the cube root of 8.
1350800	1354160	And you can check that both of these evaluate to 2.
1354160	1360760	You have to be a little bit careful though because it's not okay to distribute a radical
1360760	1363120	sign across addition.
1363120	1369600	In general, the nth root of a plus b is not equal to the nth root of a plus the nth root
1369600	1370760	of b.
1370760	1378240	And similarly, it's not okay to distribute a radical across subtraction.
1378240	1381520	If you're ever in doubt, you can always check with simple examples.
1381520	1388320	For example, the square root of 1 plus 1 is not the same thing as a square root of 1 plus
1388320	1390560	a square root of 1.
1390560	1396120	The right side evaluates to 1 plus 1 or 2, and the left side is square root of 2, an
1396120	1398760	irrational number.
1398760	1404000	The second expression to show that that fails, I don't think it'll work to use the square
1404000	1407560	root of 1 minus 1, it'll actually hold in that case.
1407560	1412640	But I can show it's false by using say the square root of 2 minus 1, which does not equal
1412640	1417160	the square root of 2 minus the square root of 1.
1417160	1421320	You might notice that these rules for radicals, the ones that hold and the ones that don't
1421320	1425360	hold, remind you of rules for exponents.
1425360	1430560	And that's no coincidence because radicals can be written in terms of exponents.
1430560	1435200	For example, if we look at the first rule, we could rewrite this.
1435200	1442040	The nth root of a times b is the same thing as the 1 over nth power.
1442040	1448160	And by exponent rules, I can distribute an exponent across multiplication.
1448160	1455640	And so this radical rule can be restated completely in terms of an exponent rule.
1455640	1462640	Similarly, the second rule can be restated in terms of exponents as a over b to the 1
1462640	1468920	over n is equal to a to the 1 over n divided by b to the 1 over n.
1468920	1475920	We can use the relationship between radicals and exponents to rewrite a to the m over n.
1475920	1482680	a to the m over n is the same thing as a to the m with the nth root taken.
1482680	1488720	It's also the same thing as the nth root of a all taken to the nth power.
1488720	1492320	To see why that's true, think about exponent rules.
1492320	1498800	So a to the m over n is the same thing as a to the m taken to the 1 over nth power.
1498800	1503000	That's because when we take a power to a power, we multiply exponents.
1503000	1509640	And m times 1 over n is equal to m over n.
1509640	1513080	But a 1 over nth power is the same thing as an nth root.
1513080	1519400	And therefore, this expression is the same thing as this expression.
1519400	1522560	And that proves the first equivalence.
1522560	1531240	The second equivalence can be proved similarly by writing a to the m over n as a to the 1
1531240	1533440	over n times m.
1533440	1539280	Again, this is worked because when I take the power to the power, I multiply exponents
1539280	1543800	1 over n times m is the same thing as m over n.
1543800	1550080	But now these two expressions are the same because the 1 over nth power is the same as
1550080	1552040	the nth root.
1552240	1557720	One mnemonic for remembering these relationships is flower over root.
1557720	1561200	So flower is like power and root is like root.
1561200	1564240	So that tells us we can write a fractional exponent.
1564240	1570360	The m becomes the power and the n becomes the root in either of these two orders.
1570360	1573280	Now let's use these rules in some examples.
1573280	1580640	If we want to compute 25 to the negative three-halves power, well, first I'll use my exponent rule
1580640	1587400	to rewrite that negative exponent as 1 over 25 to the three-halves power.
1587400	1597640	Next, I'll use the power over root mnemonic to rewrite this as 25 to the third power square-rooted
1597640	1603760	or as 25 square-rooted to the third power.
1603760	1608760	I wrote the twos there for the square root for emphasis, but most of the time people
1608760	1615240	will omit this and just write the square root without a little number there.
1615240	1619680	Now I could use either of these two equivalent expressions to continue, but I'd rather
1619680	1623160	use this one because it's easier to compute without a calculator.
1623160	1625880	The square root of 25 is just five.
1625880	1632680	Five cubed is 125, so my answer is 1 over 125.
1632680	1637680	If I tried to compute the cube of 25 first, I'd get a huge number.
1637680	1642480	In general, it's usually easier to compute the root before the power when you're working
1642480	1645960	without a calculator.
1645960	1651480	Now let's do an example simplifying a more complicated expression with exponents in it.
1651480	1656920	I want to take the square root of all this stuff, and since I don't really like negative
1656920	1662640	exponents, I'm first going to rewrite this as the square root of 60x squared y to the
1662640	1668400	sixth over z to the 11th, so I'll change that negative exponent to a positive exponent
1668400	1672880	by moving this factor to the denominator.
1672880	1677520	Now when you're asked to simplify a radical expression, that generally means to pull as
1677520	1682040	much as possible out of the radical sign.
1682040	1687040	To pull things out of the square root sign, I'm going to factor my numbers and try to
1687040	1692480	rewrite everything in terms of squares as much as possible since the square root of
1692480	1695840	a square, those two operations undo each other.
1695840	1697760	So I'll show you what I mean.
1697760	1706640	First, I'll factor 60, so 60 is going to be 2 squared times 3 times 5, and I'll just
1706640	1711360	copy everything over for now.
1711360	1716600	Now I'll break things up into squares as much as possible, so I've got a 2 squared times
1716600	1720960	3 times 5, I've already got an x squared, I'll write the y to the sixth as y squared
1720960	1726640	times y squared times y squared, and I'll write the z to the 11th as z squared times
1726640	1733720	z squared, I guess 5 times 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 times 1 extra z.
1733720	1739520	That should add up to z to the 11th if I add all those exponents together.
1739520	1744360	Now I know that I can distribute my radical sign across multiplication and division, so
1744360	1749960	I'll write this with a zillion different radicals here.
1750200	1756560	Every time I see the square root of something squared, I can just cancel those square roots
1756560	1759840	and the squares out and get what's left here.
1759840	1767360	So after doing that cancellation, I get 2 times the square root of 3 times 5 times x times
1767360	1776920	y times y times y over z times itself, I guess 5 times, times the square root of z.
1776920	1782240	Now I can clean that up with exponents, I'll write that as the square root of 15, I guess
1782240	1791240	2 times the square root of 15 times x times y cubed over z to the fifth, the square root
1791240	1792240	of z.
1792240	1798920	I'm going to leave this example as is, but sometimes people prefer to rewrite radical
1798920	1804880	expressions without radical signs in the denominator, that's called rationalizing the denominator.
1804880	1809000	I won't do it here, but I'll show you how to do it in the next example.
1809000	1812280	This example asks us to rationalize the denominator.
1812280	1820640	That means to rewrite as an equivalent expression without radical signs in the denominator.
1820640	1828040	To get rid of the radical sign in the denominator, I want to multiply my denominator by square
1828040	1832800	root of x, but I can't just multiply the denominator willy-nilly by something unless
1832800	1837400	I multiply the numerator by the same thing, so that I'm just multiplying my expression
1837400	1842840	by 1 in a fancy form and I don't change the value of my expression.
1842840	1850400	Now if I just multiply together numerators, 3x squared of x, and multiply denominators,
1850400	1855280	square root of x times square root of x is the square root of x squared, square root
1855280	1858280	of x squared is just x.
1858280	1864120	Now I can cancel my x's from the numerator and denominator and my final answer is 3 times
1864120	1865440	the square root of x.
1865440	1871920	I rationalize my denominator and the process got a nicer looking expression.
1871920	1878160	In this video, we went over the rules for radicals and we simplified some radical expressions
1878160	1886640	by working with fractional exponents, pulling things out of the radical sign, and rationalizing
1886640	1889760	the denominator.
1889760	1892120	Hi class, happy snow day.
1892120	1896400	Since class is canceled, I'm putting together this video with some additional examples on
1896400	1899200	simplifying radicals that I would have done in class.
1899200	1903880	I hope this will help you complete your assignment that's due tonight.
1903880	1908320	Let's start with this example, asking us to simplify the product of two radicals.
1908320	1913000	I could simplify each radical separately and then multiply things together, but I think
1913000	1917200	it'll save me trouble if I multiply first and then simplify.
1917200	1926960	So I'm going to multiply these together since the product of two radicals is the radical
1926960	1931280	of the product, assuming everything's positive.
1931280	1937200	I can rewrite my expression as the square root of, let's see, 5 times 15, that's going
1937200	1945200	to be 75, x times x cubed, that's x to the fourth because when I multiply two expressions,
1945200	1951160	I add the exponents and y to the seventh times y cubed, that's going to be y to the tenth
1951160	1953960	since seven plus three is ten.
1953960	1958280	Now I want to simplify by pulling as much out of the square root sign as I can.
1958280	1961720	If 75 were a perfect square, I could just take the square root of it, but since it's
1961720	1968440	not, I'm going to factor it, so 75, let's see, that's 25 times three and 25 is five
1968440	1973240	times five, so I can write that as five squared times three.
1973240	1978720	Now I can write my square root, let's see, so that's five squared times three times x
1978720	1981440	to the fourth times y to the tenth.
1981440	1987920	Now since I know that the square root of anything squared is just that original thing, assuming
1987920	1994880	that the variables are positive, I can maybe rewrite this as by breaking everything up
1994880	1996620	into a bunch of squares.
1996620	2000400	So let's see, I already have a square here, there's no hope for the three, the x to the
2000400	2004920	fourth I can write that as x squared times x squared, right, that makes four x's and
2004920	2011320	y to the tenth, I'm going to need five y squareds to get ten y's out of that, one,
2011320	2014480	two, three, y squared, y squared.
2014480	2020680	Now splitting up the square root back into a product of a bunch of square roots, every
2020680	2024560	time I see the square root of something squared I just replace it with a thing, so that's
2024560	2032040	five, I still have the square root of three, that gives me x, x, y, y, y, y, y, and I can
2032040	2037360	rewrite that as five, square root of three times x squared, y to the fifth, so that's
2037360	2040680	one way to simplify this expression.
2040680	2046840	Alternatively, I could complete this problem a little bit faster the following way, I could
2046840	2052800	go ahead and break up my five squared times three times x to the fourth times y to the
2052800	2060520	tenth, I'm going to break that up, go ahead and break that up as a product of square roots.
2060520	2065920	Now the square root of five squared is certainly five, square root of three stays the same,
2066000	2069800	square root of x to the fourth is going to be x squared, there are a couple ways to
2069800	2075360	see that, one way is the square root of x fourth, that's x to the fourth to the one
2075360	2080720	half power, since square roots are the same as half powers, and now I can multiply my
2080720	2086160	exponents to get my x squared, or alternatively I can think of that because the square root
2086160	2090640	of x to the fourth, that's the square root of x squared squared, since I take a power
2090640	2095040	to a power I multiply my exponents, square root of something squared is just a thing,
2095040	2099800	so that's x squared. Similarly the square root of y to the tenth, that's going to be
2099800	2104320	y to the fifth, notice I'm just taking half of the exponent, and you can see that the
2104320	2112320	same way, that's because if I do the square root of y to the tenth, that's the same thing
2112320	2119480	as y to the tenth to the one half, which is y to the tenth times one half, or y to the
2119480	2124920	fifth, or alternatively you can think of this as the square root of y to the tenth is the
2124920	2131240	square root of y to the fifth squared, which is y to the fifth. So if it weren't for all
2131240	2135200	that little side work I did, that would have, this would have been a faster way to get to
2135200	2140240	the same answer as before.
2140240	2145480	The next few examples have to do with rewriting expressions by rationalizing denominators.
2145480	2150000	Please pause the video for a moment and see if you can decide if these two expressions
2150000	2156720	represent the same thing or different things. In fact, they represent the same thing, and
2156720	2163120	we can see that, that we can transform a to look like b by doing something called rationalizing
2163120	2166960	denominator, trying to get all the square roots out of the denominator at the expense
2166960	2170760	of maybe putting some more squares in the numerator. So to rationalize the denominator
2170760	2176200	in this case, since there's just that one, that one piece with square roots in it, I'm
2176200	2181440	going to multiply both the top and the bottom by the square root of y, the thing that has
2181440	2187320	the square root around it. If I multiply the bottom by the square root of y, I have to
2187320	2191120	multiply the top also so I won't change the value of my expression. This way I'm just
2191120	2198800	multiplying by one in a fancy form. Now when I multiply fractions I multiply the numerator,
2198800	2202440	and I multiply the denominator. Well let's see, the square root of y times the square
2202440	2213120	root of y, that's the square root of y squared, which is the same thing as just y. So I can
2213120	2218520	bring my square roots together and get three square root of xy over five y, which is exactly
2218520	2224760	the second expression. Here are two even crazier expressions, the last one's especially crazy.
2224760	2230960	Again, try to decide if these two represent the same thing or represent a different thing.
2230960	2236400	Kind of surprisingly, they actually represent the same thing still. And we can transform
2236400	2242280	one to two by again rationalizing the denominator, this time we're going to use something called
2242280	2247320	the conjugate. And that's because we have a difference in this case of two expressions,
2247320	2253120	one of which has a square root in it. So when I have the difference of two expressions,
2253120	2260000	one of which with a square root in it, I find the conjugate by taking the sum of those two
2260040	2265840	expressions. If instead I had had the sum of two expressions, then the conjugate would
2265840	2274040	be the difference. Okay, so I'm going to multiply the top and the bottom by this conjugate of
2274040	2280760	the denominator. So let me move down here and rewrite with more space. Once again, I have
2280760	2284920	to multiply the numerator and the denominator by the same thing so that I'm not changing
2284920	2289120	the value of my expression, I'm just multiplying by one in a fancy form. Now let's look at
2289120	2293560	what happens in the denominator first, I have to multiply three by three, three by the
2293560	2298200	square root of a, negative square root of a by three, and negative square root of a by
2298200	2303200	square root of a. So that's going to give me three times three is nine plus three square
2303200	2311800	root of a minus three square root of a minus square root of a squared. So in a moment that
2311800	2318360	I'll simplify to these things cancel. So that'll be nine minus square root of a squared is
2318360	2322960	a. Notice how I've gotten rid of the square roots of the denominator, which is why it's
2322960	2329360	called rationalized denominator. We get rid of the, I don't know, irrational numbers,
2329360	2332900	the radical signs. Okay, let's look at the numerator. So again, we have to, we're going
2332900	2337480	to have four terms, this times this, this times that, b times three, b times square
2337480	2348200	root of a. That gives us 15 a plus five a square root of a plus three b plus b square
2348200	2355040	root of a. Now that's starting to look similar to this expression here. And in fact, it we
2355040	2359760	can see that it's exactly the same thing by turning our radicals into exponents. So let's
2359760	2366440	see, we still have the 15 a. This is the same thing as five a times a to the one half, we
2366440	2373880	still got the three b. And we've got b times a to the one half. And now let's see a times
2373880	2379880	a to the one half here, that's really, I can add my exponents. So that's going to be five
2379880	2387080	a to the one plus one half is three halves, three b, b, a to the one half. And that's
2387080	2393520	exactly what I have in this expression, just in a slightly different order. So these really
2393520	2400800	are the same, kind of weird. Please pause the video and try your hand at rationalizing
2400800	2407400	the denominator of this expression. Since we have a sum of two expressions in the denominator,
2407400	2413160	we want to multiply the numerator and denominator by the conjugate of the denominator. So that's
2413160	2419640	squared of a minus one. Now when we multiply out the numerator, we'll get four terms,
2419640	2429280	squared of a squared. Let's see minus the square of a. And now we have seven times
2429280	2438040	the square of a. And finally, seven times minus one, that's minus seven. On the denominator,
2438040	2444480	we get the square of a squared minus the square of a plus the square of a minus one. Notice
2444560	2450640	how the square root things cancel, just like before, that's the whole magic of using the
2450640	2455240	conjugate, it makes those square roots cancel out. So now on the numerator, squared of
2455240	2460640	a squared is a minus the square of a plus seven squared of a, that's a net of six square
2460640	2467760	of a minus seven. And then on the denominator, we have a minus one, we've gotten rid of the
2467760	2472400	square roots on the denominator, rationalize the denominator, I'm happy leaving the square
2472480	2476960	root in the numerator, but if you want to, you can change it to a exponent instead, it's really
2476960	2482320	up to you. That's all the examples I have today, I hope you enjoy the snow, which hasn't started
2482320	2488040	yet for me. And please do spend some time to finish your Alex objective if you haven't done it
2488040	2496040	already. Goodbye. This video goes over some common methods of factoring. Recall that factoring an
2496040	2502280	expression means to write it as a product. So we could factor the number 30 by writing it as six
2502320	2510040	times five, or we could factor it more completely by writing it as two times three times five. As
2510040	2518120	another example, we could factor the expression x squared plus five x plus six, by writing it as x
2518120	2526840	plus two times x plus three. In this video, I'll go over how I get from here to here, how I know how
2526840	2533280	to do the factoring. But for right now, I just want to review how I can go backwards, how I can
2533280	2539200	check that the factoring is correct. And that's just by multiplying out or distributing. If I
2539200	2545920	distribute x plus two times x plus three, then I multiply x by x that gives me x squared, x times
2545920	2552920	three gives me three x, two times x gives me two x and two times three gives me six. So that
2552920	2559520	simplifies to x squared plus five x plus six, which checks out with what I started with. So you can
2559520	2565720	think of factoring as the opposite of distributing out. And you can always check your factoring by
2565720	2572640	distributing or multiplying out. A bit of terminology, when I think of an expression as a sum of a
2572640	2578880	bunch of things, then the things I sum up are called the terms. But if I think of the same
2578880	2585520	expression as a product of things, then the things that I multiply together are called
2585520	2593440	factors. Now let's get started on techniques of factoring. When I have to factor something, I
2593440	2599120	always like to start by pulling out the greatest common factor. The greatest common factor means
2599120	2606240	the largest thing that divides each of the terms. In this first example, the largest thing that
2606240	2618200	divides both 15 and 25x is five. So the GCF is five. So I pull the five out, and then I divide each
2618200	2627280	of the terms by that number. And so I get three plus five x. Pause the video for a moment and see
2627280	2634440	if you can find the greatest common factor of x squared y and y squared x cubed. The biggest
2634480	2643560	thing that divides both x squared y and y squared x cubed is going to be x squared times y. One way
2643560	2649880	to find this is to look for the power of x that's smallest in each of these terms. So that's x
2649880	2657080	squared. And the power of y that's smallest in each of these terms is just y to the one or y. Now
2657080	2664680	if I factor out the x squared y from each of the terms, that's like dividing each term by x squared
2664680	2670680	y. If I divide the first term by x squared y, I just get one. If I divide the second term by x
2670680	2677880	squared y, I'm going to be left with an x and a y. I'll write this out on the side just to make it
2677880	2687320	more clear y squared x cubed over x squared y. That's like two y's on and three x's on the top and
2687320	2696200	two x's and a y on the bottom. So I'm left with just an x and a y. So I'll write the x y here,
2696200	2704280	and I factored my expression. As always, I can check my answer by multiplying out. So if I multiply
2704280	2711720	out my factored expression, I get x squared y is the first term and the second term. I get x,
2711720	2716680	there now let's see three x's multiplied together and two y's multiplied together,
2716680	2723400	and that checks out with what I started with. The next technique of factoring I'd like to go over
2723400	2729880	is factoring by grouping. In this example, notice that we have four terms factoring by grouping
2729880	2735560	is a handy method to look at if you have four terms in your expression you need to factor.
2737000	2741720	In order to factor by grouping, I'm first going to factor out the greatest common factor of the
2741720	2747000	first two terms, and then separately factor out the greatest common factor of the last two terms.
2747880	2755000	The greatest common factor of x cubed and three x squared is x squared. So I factor out the x
2755000	2762600	squared and I get x plus three. And now the greatest common factor of four x and 12 is just four.
2763320	2772760	So I factor out the four from those two terms. Notice that the factor of x plus three now appears
2772760	2779880	in both pieces. So I can factor out the greatest common factor of x plus three, I think I'll factor
2779880	2787000	it out on the left side instead of the right. And now I have an x squared from this first piece,
2787000	2795480	and I have a four from this second piece, and that completes my factoring by grouping.
2796520	2801640	You might wonder if we could factor further by factoring the expression x squared plus four.
2801640	2807480	But in fact, as we'll see later, this expression, which is a sum of two squares, x squared plus
2807480	2814440	two squared does not factor any further over the integers. Next, we'll do some factoring of
2814440	2822200	quadratics. A quadratic is an expression with a squared term, just a term with x in it, and a
2822200	2832200	constant term with no x's in it. I'd like to factor this expression as a product of x plus or minus
2832200	2839720	some number times x plus or minus some other number. The key idea is that if I can find those
2839720	2844440	two numbers, then if I were to distribute out this expression, those two numbers would have to
2844440	2851960	multiply to give me my constant term of eight. And these two numbers would end up having to add
2851960	2858040	to give me my negative six, because when I multiply out, this number will be a coefficient of x and
2858040	2862280	this number will be also another coefficient of x, they'll add together to the negative six.
2864600	2868840	So if I look at all the pairs of numbers that multiply together to give me eight,
2869480	2876760	so that could be one and eight, two and four, four and two, but that's really the same thing
2876760	2881720	as I had before. And that's sort of the same thing I had before. I shouldn't forget the negatives,
2881720	2886200	I could have negative one, negative eight, or I could have negative two, negative four, those
2886200	2892280	also multiply together to give me eight. Now I just have to find, see if there's a pair of these
2892280	2900280	numbers that add to negative six. And it's not hard to see that these ones will work. So now I can
2900280	2909160	write out my factoring as that would be x minus two times x minus four. And it's always a good idea
2909240	2916520	to check by multiplying out, I'm going to get x squared minus four x minus two x plus eight.
2916520	2923080	And that works out to just what I want. Now the second example is a bit more complicated because
2923080	2929320	now my leading coefficient, my coefficient of x squared is not just one, it's the number 10.
2930680	2934040	Now there are lots of different methods for approaching a problem like this. And I'm just
2934040	2939720	going to show you one method, my favorite method that uses factoring by grouping. But to start out,
2939720	2945880	I'm going to multiply my coefficient of x squared by my constant term. So I'm multiplying 10 by negative
2945880	2953080	six. That gives me negative 60. And I'll also take my coefficient of x, so you'll number 11,
2953720	2959560	and write that down here. Now I'm going to look for two numbers that multiply to give me negative
2959560	2966280	60 and add to give me 11. You might notice that this is exactly what we were doing in the previous
2966280	2971480	problem. It's just here we didn't have to multiply the coefficient of x squared by eight, because the
2971480	2977560	coefficient of x squared was just one. So to find the two numbers that multiply to negative 60 and
2977560	2983480	add to 11, you might just be able to come up with them in your head thinking about it. But if not,
2983480	2989640	you can figure it out pretty systematically by writing out all the factors, pairs of factors,
2989640	2996040	that multiply to negative 60. So I can start with negative one and 60, negative two and 30,
2996040	3004200	negative three and 20, and keep going like this until I have found factors that actually add
3004200	3009480	together to give me the number 11. And now that I look at it, I've already found them.
3010440	3017160	15 minus four gives me 11. So I don't have to continue with my chart of factors.
3017960	3025160	Now, once I found those factors, I write out my expression 10x squared, but instead of writing 11x,
3025160	3034040	I write negative 4x plus 15x. Now I copy down the negative six. Notice that negative 4x plus 15x
3034040	3041000	equals 11x, that's how I chose those numbers. And so this expression is, evaluates as the same
3041000	3046760	as this expression. I haven't changed my expression. But I have turned it into something that I can
3046760	3051800	apply factoring by grouping on, look, I've got four terms here. And so if I factor out my greatest
3051800	3058760	common factor of my first two terms, that's, let's see, I think it's 2x. So I factor out the 2x,
3058760	3066120	I get 5x minus two. And then I factor out the greatest common factor of 15x and negative six,
3066120	3073480	that would be three, I get a 5x minus two again, this is working beautifully. So I have a 5x minus
3073480	3082840	two in each part. And so I put the 5x minus two on the right, and I put what's left from these terms
3082840	3088760	in here. So that's 2x plus three. And I have factored my expression.
3091400	3095560	There are a couple of special kinds of expressions that appear frequently,
3095560	3100040	that it's handy to just memorize the formula for. So the first one is the difference of squares.
3100040	3107320	If you see something of the form a squared minus b squared, then you can factor that as a plus b
3107320	3113960	times a minus b. And let's just check that that works. If I do a plus b times a minus b and multiply
3113960	3123800	that out, I get a squared minus a b plus b a minus b squared, and those middle two terms cancel out.
3123800	3129480	So it gives me back the difference of squares just like I want it. So for this first example,
3130120	3137240	if I think of x squared minus 16 as x squared minus four squared, then I can see that's a
3137240	3143960	difference of squares. And I can immediately write it as x plus four times x minus four. And the second
3143960	3152520	example, nine p squared minus one, that's the same thing as three p squared minus one squared.
3152520	3161800	So that's three p plus one times three p minus one. Notice that if I have a sum of squares,
3163160	3170760	for example, x squared plus four, which is x squared plus two squared,
3170760	3177560	then that does not factor. The difference of squares formula doesn't apply. And there is no
3177560	3184280	formula that applies for a sum of squares. There is, however, a formula for both a difference of
3184280	3192760	cubes and a sum of cubes. The difference of cubes formula, a cube minus b cubed is a minus b times
3192760	3200200	a squared plus a b plus b squared. The formula for the sum of cubes is pretty much the same,
3200280	3207640	you just switch the negative and positive sign here and here. So that gives us a plus b times
3207640	3215160	a squared minus a b plus b squared. As usual, you can check these formulas by multiplying out.
3215960	3223080	Let's look at one example of using these formulas, y cube plus 27 is actually a sum of two cubes,
3223080	3230840	because it's y cubed plus three cubed. So I can factor it using the sum of cubes formula
3230840	3239880	by plugging in y for a and three for b. That gives me y plus three times y squared minus
3239880	3246200	y times three plus three squared. And I can clean that up a little bit to read y plus three times
3246200	3253960	y squared minus three y plus nine. So in this video, we went over several methods of factoring.
3253960	3261640	We did factoring out the greatest common factor. We did factoring by grouping. We did factoring
3261640	3273080	quadratics. And we did a difference of squares. And we did a difference and a sum of cubes.
3273080	3279480	In more complicated problems, you may need to apply several of these techniques in order
3279480	3283720	to get through a single problem. For example, you might need to start by pulling out a greatest
3283720	3291640	common factor, and then do a factoring of quadratics or something similar. Now go forth and factor.
3292840	3299080	This video gives some additional examples of factoring. Please pause the video and decide
3299080	3304120	which of these first five expressions factor and which one does not.
3306120	3311960	The first expression can be factored by pulling out a common factor of x from each term.
3313320	3322520	So that becomes x times x plus one. The second example can be factored as a difference of two
3322520	3330600	squares. Since x squared minus twenty five is something squared minus something else squared.
3330600	3337080	And we know that anytime we have something like a squared minus b squared, that's a plus b times
3337080	3346200	a minus b. So we can factor this as x plus five times x minus five. The third one is a sum of
3346200	3352840	two squares. There's no way to factor a sum of two squares over real numbers. So this is the one
3352840	3361000	that does not factor. Just for completeness, let's look at the next two. This next one does factor
3361000	3368280	by grouping. When we factor by grouping, we pull the biggest common factor out of the first two
3368360	3375240	terms. That would be an x squared. That becomes x squared times x plus two. And then we factor
3375240	3381720	as much as we can out of the next two terms. That would be a three times x plus two. Notice that the
3381720	3389000	x plus two factor now occurs in both of the resulting terms. So we can pull that x plus two out
3389960	3399480	and get x plus two times x squared plus three. We can't factor any further because x squared plus
3399480	3407720	three doesn't factor. Finally, we have a quadratic. This also factors. And I like to factor these
3408440	3417080	also using a factoring by grouping trick. So first, what I do is I multiply the coefficient of x
3417160	3424280	squared and the constant term five times eight is 40. I'll write that on the top of my x. Now I
3424280	3430200	take the coefficient of the x term that's negative 14. And I write that on the bottom part of the x.
3430840	3439480	Now I'm looking for two numbers that multiply to 40 and add to negative 14. Sometimes I can just
3439480	3447080	guess numbers like this. But if not, I start writing out factors of 40. So factors of 40,
3447080	3454200	I could do one times 40. Well, now I just noticed I'm trying to add to a negative number. So if I
3454200	3458360	use two positive factors, there's no way there's going to add to a negative number. It's better
3458360	3465080	for me to use negative numbers that factor 40. A negative times a negative still multiplies to 40,
3465080	3470760	but they have a chance of adding to a negative number. So but negative one and negative 40 of
3470760	3474760	course don't work. They don't add to negative 14. They add to negative 41. So let me try some other
3474760	3480760	factors. The next biggest number that divides 40 besides one is two. So I'll try negative two and
3480760	3488920	negative 20. Those add to negative 22. That doesn't work. Next one that divides 40 would be four. So
3488920	3495800	I'll try negative four and negative 10. Aha, we have a winner. So negative four plus negative 10
3495800	3502040	is negative 14. Negative four times negative 10 is positive 40. We've got it. All right. So the next
3502040	3510200	step is to use factoring by grouping. We're going to first split up this negative 14 x as negative
3510200	3517880	four x minus 10 x and carry down the eight and the five x squared. Notice that this works because
3517880	3526280	I picked negative four negative 10 to add up to negative 14. So so negative four x minus 10 x will
3526280	3531640	add up to negative 14 x. So I've got the same expression just just expanded out a little bit.
3531640	3536680	Now I have four terms I can do factoring by grouping. So I can group the first two terms
3536680	3542280	and factor out the biggest thing I can. That would be an x times five x minus four. And now I'll
3542280	3549320	factor the biggest thing I can out of these two numbers including the the negative. So that becomes
3549320	3556760	let's see I can factor out a negative two and that becomes five x minus four since negative two times
3556760	3563240	minus four is eight. All right, I've got the same five x plus four in both my terms. So factoring
3563240	3568840	by grouping is going swimmingly. I can factor out the five x minus four from both those terms
3568840	3574840	and I get the x minus two and I factored this quadratic. If I want to of course I can always
3574840	3582840	check my work by distributing out by multiplying out. So a check here would be multiplying five x
3582840	3591960	times x is five x squared five x minus times minus two is minus 10 x minus four times x is minus
3591960	3598440	four x and minus four times minus two is plus eight. So let's see this does check out to exactly
3598440	3608360	what it should be. So that was the method of factoring a quadratic. And all of these factor
3608360	3616680	except for the sum of squares. So we saw that factoring by grouping is handy for factoring
3617640	3625240	this expression here. It was also handy for factoring the quadratic indirectly after splitting up
3627560	3637160	the middle term into two terms. So how can you tell when an expression is is appropriate to
3637160	3643400	factor by grouping? There's an easy way to tell that it might be a candidate and that's that it
3643400	3650040	has four terms. So if you see four terms or in the case of the quadratic you can split it up into
3650040	3653960	four terms then that's a good candidate for factoring by grouping because you can group the
3653960	3658920	first two terms, group the second two terms. Factoring by grouping won't always work on
3660840	3666920	expressions with four terms but that's like the first thing to look for. So let's just review
3666920	3671800	what are the same main techniques of factoring. We saw these on the previous page. We saw there was
3671800	3676120	pull out common factors. There's difference of squares.
3678600	3684120	There's factoring by grouping. There's factoring quadratics.
3686760	3693240	And one more that I didn't mention is factoring sums and differences of cubes.
3693880	3701720	That uses the formulas a cubed minus b cubed is a minus b times a squared plus a b plus b
3701720	3709800	squared and a cubed plus b cubed is a plus b times a squared minus a b plus b squared.
3711800	3718280	One important tip when factoring, I always recommend doing this first. Pull out the common
3719160	3724760	factors first. That'll simplify things in making the rest of factoring easier.
3725320	3730920	One more tip is that you might need to do several of these factoring techniques in one problem.
3730920	3737000	For example, you might have to first pull out a common factor then factor a difference of squares
3737000	3741080	and then you might notice that one of your factors is itself a difference of squares and you have to
3741080	3747800	apply a difference of squares again. So don't stop when you factor a little bit. Keep factoring as
3747800	3754120	far as you can go. Here are some extra examples of factoring quadratics for you to practice.
3754120	3761640	Please pause the video and give these a try. For the first one, let's multiply two times negative
3761640	3770600	14. That gives us negative 28 and then we'll bring the three down in the bottom of the x. Now
3770600	3776360	we're looking for two numbers that multiply to negative 28 and add to three. Well to multiply
3776360	3781240	two numbers to get a negative 28 will need one of them to be negative and one of them to be positive.
3781240	3791080	So let's see one negative 128 or one negative 28. Those don't work. Let's see negative 214 or two
3791080	3795960	negative 14. Those don't work. Hey, I just noticed the positive number had better be bigger than the
3795960	3800840	negative number so they add to a positive number. Let's see what comes next. How about
3801160	3810760	negative 4 times 7, 4 times negative 7. I think 4, negative 4 times 7 will work. So I'll write
3810760	3822920	those here negative 4, 7. Copy down the 2 z squared and I'll split up the 3 z into negative 4 z plus
3823000	3832200	7 z and then minus 14. Now factoring by grouping pull out a 2 z that becomes z minus 2 pull out a 7
3832200	3841320	and that becomes z minus 2 again looking good. I've got 2 z plus 7 times z minus 2 as my factored
3841320	3848760	expression. My second expression I could work at the same way drawing my x and factoring by grouping
3848760	3854520	that kind of thing but it's actually going to be easier if I notice first that I can pull out a
3854520	3859480	common factor from all of my terms. That'll make things a lot simpler to deal with. So notice that
3859480	3863800	a 5 divides each of these terms and in fact I'm going to go ahead and pull out the negative 5 because
3863800	3867560	I don't like having negatives in front of my squared term. So I'm going to pull out a common
3867560	3873560	factor of negative 5. Again, it would work if I forgot to do this but it would be a lot more
3873560	3880840	complicated. So negative 5 v squared this becomes minus, no this becomes plus 9v
3881560	3887480	since 9 times negative 5 is negative 45 and this becomes minus 10 since negative 10 times
3887480	3893400	negative 5 is positive 50. Now I can start my x and my factoring by grouping or I can use kind of a
3893400	3898680	shortcut method which you may have seen before so I can just put v's here and then I know that
3898680	3903080	whatever numbers go here they're going to have to multiply to the negative 10 and they're going to
3903080	3911240	have to add to the 9. So that would be a plus 10 and a minus 1 will do the trick.
3912840	3917480	Those are all my factoring examples for today. I hope you enjoy your snow morning and have a
3917480	3925160	chance to spend some time working in Alex. Bye. This video is about working with rational
3925160	3930760	expressions. A rational expression is a fraction usually with variables in it something like
3930760	3938840	x plus 2 over x squared minus 3 is a rational expression. In this video we'll practice adding,
3938840	3945640	subtracting, multiplying and dividing rational expressions and simplifying them to lowest terms.
3948200	3953080	We'll start with simplifying to lowest terms. Recall that if you have a fraction with just
3953080	3960520	numbers in it something like 21 over 45 we can reduce it to lowest terms by factoring the numerator
3961320	3964280	and factoring the denominator
3967160	3977320	and then canceling common factors. So in this example the 3's cancel and our fraction reduces
3977320	3985240	to 7 over 15. If we want to reduce a rational expression with variables in it to lowest terms
3985320	3991640	we proceed the same way. First we'll factor the numerator that's 3 times x plus 2
3992280	3999880	and then factor the denominator. In this case it factors to x plus 2 times x plus 2 we could
3999880	4006840	also write that as x plus 2 squared. Now we cancel the common factors and we're left with
4006840	4012680	3 over x plus 2. Definitely a simpler way of writing that rational expression.
4013320	4021080	Next let's practice multiplying and dividing. Recall that if we multiply two fractions with
4021080	4026040	just numbers in them we simply multiply the numerators and multiply the denominators. So in
4026040	4035800	this case we would get 4 times 2 over 3 times 5 or 8 fifteenths. If we want to divide two fractions
4035800	4043000	like in the second example then we can rewrite it as multiplying by the reciprocal
4043560	4051000	of the fraction on the denominator. So here we get 4 fifths times 3 halves and that gives us
4052200	4060840	12 tenths but actually we could reduce that fraction to 6 fifths. We use the same rules when we
4060840	4066760	compute the product or quotient of two rational expressions with the variables in them. Here
4066760	4075160	we're trying to divide two rational expressions so instead we can multiply by the reciprocal.
4075160	4082120	I call this flipping and multiplying and now we just multiply the numerators
4083800	4085400	and multiply the denominators.
4085800	4095800	It might be tempting at this point to multiply out to distribute out the numerator and the denominator
4095800	4100760	but actually it's better to leave it in this factored form and factor it even more completely.
4100760	4106840	That way we'll be able to reduce the rational expression to cancel the common factors. So let's
4107160	4115800	the x squared plus x factors as x times x plus 1 and x squared minus 16 that's a difference of
4115800	4124040	two squares that's x plus 4 times x minus 4. The denominator is already fully factored so we'll
4124040	4131720	just copy it over and now we can cancel common factors here and here and we're left with x times
4131720	4140360	x minus 4. This is our final answer. Adding and subtracting fractions is a little more complicated
4140360	4147000	because we first have to find a common denominator. A common denominator is an expression that both
4147000	4153800	denominators divide into. It's usually best of the long run to use the least common denominator
4153800	4160200	which is the smallest expression that both denominators divide into. In this example
4160200	4167560	if we just want a common denominator we could use 6 times 15 which is 90 because both 6 and 15
4167560	4173720	divide evenly into 90 but if we want the least common denominator the best way to do that is to
4173720	4184120	factor the two denominators so 6 is 2 times 3 15 is 3 times 5 and then put together only the factors
4184120	4193800	we need for both 6 and 15 to divide our numbers so if we just use 2 times 3 times 5 which is 30
4195080	4201560	we know that 2 times 3 will divide it and 3 times 5 will also divide it and we won't be able to get
4201560	4206840	a denominator any smaller because we need the factors 2, 3, and 5 in order to ensure both
4206840	4212920	these numbers divide it. Once we have our least common denominator we can rewrite each of our
4212920	4221080	fractions in terms of that denominator. So 7, 6 I need to get a 30 in the denominator so I'm going
4221080	4229240	to multiply that by 5 over 5. I multiply by the factors that are missing from the current
4229240	4234520	denominator in order to get my least common denominator of 30. For the second fraction
4235160	4248360	4 15, 15 times 2 is 30 so I'm going to multiply by 2 over 2. Now I can rewrite this as 35 30th
4249480	4256360	minus 8 30th and now that I have a common denominator I can just subtract my two numerators
4256360	4270520	and I get 27 30th. If I factor I can reduce this to 3 squared over 2 times 5 which is 9 tenths.
4271640	4276600	The process for finding the sum of two rational expressions with variables in them
4276600	4282280	follows the exact same process. First we have to find the least common denominator. I'll do that by
4282280	4290040	factoring the two denominators. So 2x plus 2 factors as 2 times x plus 1, x squared minus 1
4290040	4296120	that's a difference of 2 squared so that's x plus 1 times x minus 1. Now for the least common
4296120	4302280	denominator I'm going to take all the factors I need to get an expression that each of these
4302280	4308520	divides into. So I need the factor 2, I need the factor x plus 1, and I need the factor x minus 1.
4308520	4313000	I don't have to repeat the factor x plus 1, I just need to have it one time
4313000	4319880	and so I will get my least common denominator 2 times x plus 1 times x minus 1. I'm not going to
4319880	4324440	bother multiplying this out, it's actually better to leave it in factored form to help me simplify
4324440	4332840	later. Now I can rewrite each of my two rational expressions by multiplying by whatever's missing
4332840	4339400	from the denominator in terms of the least common denominator. So what I mean is I can rewrite 3 over
4339400	4345960	2x plus 2. I'll write the 2x plus 2 as 2 times x plus 1 already in factored form. And then I noticed
4345960	4351800	that compared to the least common denominator I'm missing the factor of x minus 1. So I multiply
4352520	4358280	the numerator and the denominator by x minus 1. I just need it in the denominator but I can't get
4358280	4362680	away with just multiplying by the denominator without changing my expression. I have to multiply
4362680	4368680	by it on the numerator and the denominator so I'm just multiplying by 1 in a fancy form and not
4368680	4373720	changing the value here. So now I do the same thing for the second rational expression. I'll
4373720	4379080	write the denominator in factored form to make it easier to see what's missing from the denominator.
4379080	4385080	What's missing in this denominator compared to my least common denominator is just the factor 2.
4385160	4392040	So I'll multiply the numerator and the denominator by 2. Now I can rewrite everything. So the first
4392040	4400520	rational expression becomes 3 times x minus 1 over 2 times x plus 1 x minus 1 and the second one
4400520	4409880	becomes 5 times 2 over 2 times x plus 1 x minus 1. Notice that I now have a common denominator
4409880	4417560	so I can just add together my numerators. So I get 3 times x minus 1 plus 10 over 2
4417560	4424360	times x plus 1 x minus 1. I'd like to simplify this and the best way to do that is to leave the
4424360	4430600	denominator in factored form but I do have to multiply out the numerator so that I can add
4430600	4442520	things together. So I get 3x minus 3 plus 10 over 2 times x plus 1 x minus 1 or 3x plus 7 over 2
4442520	4450600	times x plus 1 x minus 1. Now 3x plus 7 doesn't factor and there's therefore no factors that I
4450600	4457240	can cancel out. So this is already reduced as much as it can be. This is my final answer.
4457240	4465960	In this video we saw how to simplify rational expressions to lowest terms by factoring and
4465960	4471960	canceling common factors. We also saw how to multiply rational expressions by multiplying the
4471960	4477080	numerator and multiplying the denominator, how to divide rational expressions by flipping and
4477080	4483080	multiplying, and how to add and subtract rational expressions by writing them in terms of the least
4483160	4490680	common denominator. This video is about solving quadratic equations. A quadratic equation is
4490680	4497160	an equation that contains the square of the variable say x squared but no higher powers of x.
4498360	4506120	The standard form for a quadratic equation is the form ax squared plus bx plus c equals zero
4506840	4516040	where a, b, and c represent real numbers and a is not zero so that we actually have an x squared
4516040	4525800	term. Let me give you an example. 3x squared plus 7x minus 2 equals zero is a quadratic equation in
4525800	4537640	standard form. Here a is 3, b is 7, and c is minus 2. The equation 3x squared equals minus 7x plus 2
4537640	4543640	is also a quadratic equation. It's just not in standard form. The key steps to solving quadratic
4543640	4551000	equations are usually to write the equation in standard form and then either factor it
4551960	4556360	or use the quadratic formula which I'll show you later in this video.
4559400	4566680	Let's start with the example y squared equals 18 minus 7y. Here our variable is y and we need to
4566680	4573640	rewrite this quadratic equation in standard form. We can do this by subtracting 18 from both sides
4573640	4582920	and adding 7y to both sides. That gives us the equation y squared minus 18 plus 7y equals zero
4582920	4589720	and I can rearrange a little bit to get y squared plus 7y minus 18 equals zero. Now I've got my
4589720	4597320	equation in standard form. Next I'm going to try to factor it. So I need to look for two numbers
4597320	4605640	that multiply to negative 18 and add to 7. Two numbers that work are 9 and negative 2,
4605640	4613640	so I can factor my expression on the left as y plus 9 times y minus 2 equals zero.
4614680	4619400	Now anytime you have two quantities that multiply together to give you zero,
4620120	4625080	either the first quantity has to be zero or the second quantity has to be zero or I suppose they
4625080	4630120	both could be zero in some situations. This is really handy because that means that I know
4630120	4638440	that either y plus 9 equals zero or y minus 2 equals zero. So I can as my next step set my
4638440	4647320	factors equal to zero. So y plus 9 equals zero or y minus 2 equals zero which means that y equals
4647320	4654520	negative 9 or y equals 2. It's not a bad idea to check that those answers actually work by
4654600	4661720	plugging them into the original equation negative 9 squared does that equal 18 minus 7 times negative
4661720	4669000	9 and you can work out that it does and similarly 2 squared equals 18 minus 7 times 2.
4670920	4677240	In the next example, let's find solutions of the equation w squared equals 121. This is a
4677240	4683880	quadratic equation because it's got a square of my variable w. I can rewrite it in standard form
4684520	4693720	by subtracting 121 from both sides. Notice that a is equal to one b is equal to zero because there's
4693720	4702600	no w term and c is equal to negative 121 in the standard form a w squared plus b w plus c equals
4702600	4712280	zero. Next step, I'm going to try to factor this expression. So since 121 is 11 squared,
4712280	4719880	this is a difference of two squares and it factors as w plus 11 times w minus 11 is equal to zero.
4720600	4730600	If I set the factors equal to zero, I get w plus 11 equals zero or w minus 11 equals zero. So w
4730600	4738200	equals minus 11 or w equals 11. In this example, I could have solved the equation more simply. I
4738200	4745640	could have instead said that if w squared is 121, then w has to equal plus or minus the square root
4745640	4753080	of 121. In other words, w is plus or minus 11. If you solve the equation this way, it's important
4753080	4759560	to remember the plus or minus since minus 11 squared equals 121 just like 11 squared does.
4761000	4767320	Now let's find the solutions for the equation x times x plus 2 equals 7. Some people might be
4767320	4772680	tempted to say that, oh, if two numbers multiply to equal seven, then one of them better equal one
4772680	4778040	and the other equals seven or maybe negative one and negative seven. But that's faulty reasoning
4778040	4785160	in this case, because x and x plus two don't have to be whole numbers. They could be crazy
4785160	4793000	fractions or even irrational numbers. So instead, let's rewrite this equation in standard form.
4793720	4801160	To do that, I'm first going to multiply out. So x times x is x squared, x times 2 is 2x,
4801160	4807160	that equals seven, and I'll subtract the seven from both sides to get x squared plus 2x minus
4807160	4813080	seven is zero. Now I'm looking to factor it, so I need two numbers that multiply to negative seven
4813080	4819400	and add to two. So it's the only way to factor negative seven is as negative one times seven or
4819480	4824840	seven times negative one. It's easy to see that there are no whole numbers that will
4826120	4831560	work. So there's no way to factor this expression over the integers. Instead, let's use the quadratic
4831560	4840760	equation. So we have our leading coefficient of x squared is one. So a is one, b is two, and c is
4840760	4846600	minus seven. And we're going to plug that into the equation, quadratic equation, which goes x
4847400	4854520	equals negative b plus or minus the square root of b squared minus 4ac all over 2a.
4855880	4860280	Different people have different ways of remembering this formula. I'd like to remember it by seeing
4860280	4868840	it. x equals negative b plus or minus the square root of b squared minus 4ac all over 2a. But you
4868840	4874680	can use any new monarchy like. Anyway, plugging in here, we have x equals negative 2 plus or minus
4874760	4881560	the square root of two squared minus four times one times negative seven. It's important to remember
4881560	4890440	the negative seven there, all over two times one. Now two squared is four, and four times one times
4890440	4897160	negative seven is negative 28. So this whole quantity under the square root sign becomes four
4897160	4904440	minus negative 28 or 32. So I can rewrite this as x equals negative two plus or minus the square
4904440	4915320	root of 32 all over two. Since 32 is 16 times two, and 16 is a perfect square, I can rewrite this as
4915320	4920920	negative two plus or minus the square root of 16 times the square root of two over two, which is
4921000	4924760	negative two plus or minus four times the square root of two over two.
4926680	4934440	Next, I'm going to split up my fraction as negative two over two plus or minus four square
4934440	4940760	root of two over two, and then simplify those fractions. This becomes negative one plus or
4940760	4948120	minus two square root of two. So my answers are negative one plus two square root of two,
4948120	4953240	and negative one minus two square root of two. And if I need a decimal answer for any reason,
4953240	4960040	I could work those out on my calculator. As our final example, let's find all real solutions for
4960040	4967400	the equation one half y squared equals one third y minus two. I'll start as usual by putting it in
4967400	4976840	standard form. So that gives me one half y squared minus one third y plus two equals zero. I could
4976840	4982280	go ahead and start trying to factor or use the quadratic formula right now. But I find fractional
4982280	4987080	coefficients kind of annoying. So I'd like to get rid of them by doing what I call clearing the
4987080	4991720	denominator. That means I'm going to multiply the whole entire equation by the least common
4991720	4997080	denominator. In this case, the least common denominator is two times three or six. So I'll
4997080	5002200	multiply the whole equation by six. I have to make sure I multiply both sides of the equation,
5002200	5008360	but in this case, six times zero is just zero. And when I distribute the six, I get three y squared
5008360	5015320	minus two y plus 12 equals zero. Now, I could try to factor this, but I think it's easier
5015320	5023960	probably just to plunge in and use the quadratic formula. So I get x equals negative b, that's
5023960	5032360	negative negative two or two plus or minus the square root of b squared minus four times a times
5032360	5042040	c all over two a. Working out the stuff on the square root sign negative two squared is four.
5042040	5050840	And here we have, let's see 144. So this simplifies to x equals two plus or minus the square root of
5051720	5059320	four minus 144, that's negative 140 all over six. Well, if you're concerned about the
5059320	5064360	negative number under the square root sign, you should be, we can't take the square root of a
5064360	5070200	negative number and get and get a real number as our answer, there's no real number whose square is
5070200	5077640	a negative number. And therefore, our conclusion is we have no real solutions to this quadratic
5077640	5084600	equation. In this video, we solve some quadratic equations by first writing them in standard form
5084600	5090680	and then either factoring or using the quadratic formula. In some examples, factoring doesn't
5090680	5096040	work. It's not possible to factor the equation. But in fact, using the quadratic formula will
5096040	5102600	always work, even if it's also possible to solve it by factoring. So you can't really lose by using
5102600	5109000	the quadratic formula. It's just sometimes it'll be faster to factor instead. This video is about
5109000	5115800	solving equations with absolute values in them. Recall that the absolute value of a positive
5115800	5122760	number is just the number, but the absolute value of a negative number is its opposite. In general,
5122760	5127960	I think of the absolute value of a number as representing its distance from zero on the number
5127960	5137800	line. The number four and the number negative four are both at distance four from zero. And so the
5137800	5146840	absolute value of both of them is four. Similarly, if I write the equation, the absolute value of x
5146840	5157480	is three, that means that x has to be three units away from zero on the number line. And so x would
5157480	5163800	have to be either negative three or three. Let's start with the equation three times the absolute
5163800	5172200	value of x plus two equals four. I'd like to isolate the absolute value part of the equation.
5173160	5176920	I can do this by starting with my original equation,
5177480	5185800	subtracting two from both sides, and dividing both sides by three.
5190200	5197480	Now I'll think in terms of distance. On a number line, the absolute value of x is two thirds,
5197480	5207800	means that x is two thirds away from zero. So x could be here, or here, at negative two thirds,
5207800	5215480	or at two thirds. And the answer to my equation is x is negative two thirds, or two thirds.
5216760	5224280	I can check my answers by plugging in three times the absolute value of negative two thirds
5224280	5229560	plus two. I need to check if that equals four. Well, the absolute value of negative two thirds
5229560	5235640	is just two thirds. So this is three times two thirds plus two, which works out to four.
5238120	5245480	Similarly, if I plug in positive two thirds, it also works out to give me a correct answer.
5246360	5250600	This second example is a little different, because the absolute value sign is around
5250600	5259160	a more complicated expression, not just around the x. I would start by isolating the absolute value part,
5262120	5268120	but it's already isolated. So I'll just go ahead and jump to thinking about distance
5268120	5275160	on the number line. So on my number line, the whole expression three x plus two
5275800	5285000	is supposed to be at a distance of four from zero. So that means that three x plus two is here at four,
5285000	5294040	or three x plus two is at negative four. I'll write those as equations. Three x plus two equals four,
5294040	5301880	or three x plus two is minus four, and then I can solve. So this becomes three x equals two,
5301960	5310200	or x equals two thirds. And over here, I get three x equals minus six, or x equals minus two.
5311480	5318280	Finally, I'll check my answers. I'll leave it to you to verify that they both work.
5319720	5324920	A common mistake on absolute value equations is to get rid of the absolute value signs,
5324920	5330680	like we did here, and then just solve for one answer instead of solving for both answers.
5331480	5335560	Another mistake sometimes people make is once they get the first answer, they just assume
5335560	5342680	that the negative of that works also. But that doesn't always work. In the first example,
5342680	5346600	our two answers were both the negatives of each other. But in our second examples,
5346600	5351560	our two answers were not just the opposites of each other. One was two thirds, and the other was
5351560	5358440	negative two. In this third example, let's again isolate the absolute value part of the equation.
5358520	5367240	So starting with our original equation, we can subtract 16 from both sides,
5368760	5372760	and divide both sides by five, or equivalently multiply by one fifth.
5377560	5384040	Now let's think about distance on the number line. We have an absolute value needs to equal
5384040	5390920	negative three. So that means whatever is inside the absolute value sign needs to be at distance
5390920	5396920	negative three from zero. Well, you can't be at distance negative three from zero.
5397480	5401320	Another way of thinking about this is you can't have the absolute value of something and end up
5401320	5407480	with a negative number. Absolute value is always positive or zero. So this equation doesn't actually
5407480	5417560	make sense. And there are no solutions to this equation. In this video, we solved absolute
5417560	5424680	value equations. In many cases, an absolute value equation will have two solutions. But in some cases,
5424680	5432440	it'll have no solutions. And occasionally, it'll have just one solution. This video is about solving
5432440	5439240	rational equations. A rational equation like this one is an equation that has rational expressions
5439240	5443080	in it. In other words, an equation that has some variables in the denominator.
5445000	5449640	There are several different approaches for solving a rational equation, but they all start
5449640	5456200	by finding the least common denominator. In this example, the denominators are x plus three and x,
5456200	5462280	we can think of one as just having a denominator of one. Since the denominators don't have any
5462280	5467000	factors in common, I can find the least common denominator just by multiplying them together.
5468520	5475320	My next step is going to be clearing the denominator. By this, I mean that I multiply
5475320	5483400	both sides of my equation by this least common denominator, x plus three times x. I multiply
5483400	5490200	on the left side of the equation. And I multiply by the same thing on the right side of the equation.
5490200	5496360	Since I'm doing the same thing, the both sides of the equation, I don't change the value of the
5496360	5502040	equation. Multiplying the least common denominator on both sides of the equation is equivalent to
5502040	5507800	multiplying it by all three terms in the equation. I can see this when I multiply out.
5509080	5516280	I'll rewrite the left side the same as before pretty much. And then I'll distribute the right
5516280	5524440	side to get x plus three times x times one plus x plus three times x times one over x.
5524440	5530280	So I've actually multiplied the least common denominator by all three terms of my equation.
5530280	5536040	Now I can have a blast canceling things. The x plus three cancels with the x plus three on the
5536040	5543320	denominator. The here are nothing cancels out because there's no denominator. And here the x
5543320	5548440	in the numerator cancels with the x in the denominator. So I can rewrite my expression as
5548440	5556920	x squared equals x plus three times x times one plus x plus three. Now I'm going to simplify.
5558440	5565400	So I'll leave the x squared alone on this side, I'll distribute out x squared plus three x plus
5565400	5573720	x plus three. Hey look the x squareds cancel on both sides. And so I get zero equals four x plus
5573720	5581400	three. So four x is negative three and x is negative three fourths. Finally I'm going to plug in my
5581400	5586840	answer to check. This is a good idea for any kind of equation. But it's especially important for a
5586840	5591320	rational equation because occasionally for rational equations you'll get what's called extraneous
5591320	5595400	solutions. Solutions that don't actually work in your original equation because they make the
5595400	5600440	denominator zero. Now in this example I don't think we're going to get any extraneous equations
5600440	5606360	because negative three fourths is not going to make any of these denominators zero. So it should
5606360	5618680	work out fine when I plug in. If I plug in I get this. I can simplify the denominator here negative
5618680	5625480	three fourths plus three. Three is twelve fourths. That becomes nine fourths. And this is one I'll flip
5625480	5635160	and multiply to get minus four thirds. So here I can simplify my complex fraction. It ends up being
5635160	5641720	negative three ninths and one minus four thirds is negative one third. So that all seems to check out.
5641720	5650680	And so my final answer is x equals negative three fourths. This next example looks a little trickier
5650680	5657720	and it is. But the same approach will work. First I'll find the least common denominator. So here my
5657720	5667880	denominators are c minus five, c plus one, and c squared minus four c minus five. I'm going to
5667880	5675480	factor that as c minus five times c plus one. Now my least common denominator needs to have
5675480	5681720	just enough factors to that each of these denominators divide into it. So I need the factor
5681720	5687560	c minus five. I need the factor c plus one. And now I've already got all the factors I need for
5687560	5694840	this denominator. So here is my least common denominator. Next step is to clear the denominators.
5694840	5702120	So I do this by multiplying both sides of the equation by my least common denominator. In fact,
5702120	5706680	I can just multiply each of the three terms by this least common denominator.
5709400	5714760	I went ahead and wrote my third denominator in factored form to make it easier to see what
5714760	5724760	cancels. Now canceling time not dies. This dies and both of those factors die. Canceling out the
5724760	5730040	denominators the whole point of multiplying by the least common denominator. You're multiplying by
5730040	5733960	something that's big enough to kill every single denominator. So you don't have to deal with
5733960	5744680	denominators anymore. Now I'm going to simplify by multiplying out. So I get let's see c plus one
5744680	5754760	times four c that's four c squared plus four c. Now I get minus just c minus five. And then over
5754760	5766040	here I get three c squared plus three. I can rewrite the minus quantity c minus five as minus c plus
5766040	5775160	five. And now I can subtract the three c squared from both sides to get just a c squared over here.
5776200	5785960	And the four c minus c that becomes three c. And finally I can subtract the three from both
5785960	5794200	sides to get c squared plus three c plus two equals zero. I've got myself a quadratic equation
5794200	5801480	that looks like a nice one that factors. So this factors to c plus one times c plus two equals zero.
5802040	5809800	So either c plus one is zero or c plus two is zero. So c equals negative one or c equals negative two.
5812120	5819480	Now let's see we need to still check our answers. Without even going to the trouble of
5819480	5825480	calculating anything, I can see that c equals negative one is not going to work. Because if I plug
5825480	5833240	it in to this denominator here, I get a denominator zero, which doesn't make sense. So c equals minus
5833240	5842040	one is an extraneous solution. It doesn't actually satisfy my original equation. And so I can just
5842120	5849880	cross it right out. c equals negative two. I can go if I go ahead and that doesn't make any of my
5849880	5855480	denominator zero. So if I haven't made any mistakes, it should satisfy my original equation. But
5856440	5865880	I'll just plug it in to be sure. And after some simplifying, I get a true statement.
5866440	5873320	So my final answer is c equals negative two. In this video, we solved a couple of rational
5873320	5880920	equations using the method of finding the least common denominator and then clearing the denominator.
5882200	5886840	We cleared the denominator by multiplying both sides of the equation by the least common denominator
5886840	5893080	or equivalently multiplying each of the terms by that denominator. There's another equivalent
5893160	5899160	method that some people prefer. It still starts out the same, we find the least common denominator,
5899160	5907480	but then we write all the fractions over that least common denominator. So in this example,
5907480	5913720	we'd still use the least common denominator of x plus three times x. But our next step would be to
5913720	5918680	write each of these rational expressions over that common denominator by multiplying the top and
5919640	5925960	the bottom by the appropriate things. So one, in order to get the common denominator of x plus
5925960	5931880	three x, I need to multiply the top and the bottom by x plus three times x, one over x, I need to
5931880	5937640	multiply the top and the bottom just by x plus three, since that's what's missing from the denominator
5937640	5948360	x. Now if I simplify a little bit, let's see, this is x squared over that common denominator. And
5950840	5957560	here I have just x plus three times x over that denominator. And here I have x plus three over
5957560	5964760	that common denominator. Now add together my fractions on the right side. So they have a
5964760	5973640	common denominator. So this is x plus three times x plus x plus three. And now I have two
5973640	5979560	fractions that have that are equal that have the same denominator, therefore their numerators have
5979560	5990280	to be equal also. So the next step is to set the numerators equal. So I get x squared is x plus three
5990280	5997240	times x plus x plus three. And if you look back at the previous way we solved this equation,
5997240	6002280	you'll recognize this equation. And so from here on, we just continue as before.
6005560	6009400	When choosing between these two methods, I personally tend to prefer the clear the denominators
6009400	6013320	method because it's a little bit less writing, you don't have to, you get rid of those denominators
6013320	6017720	earlier, you don't have to write them as many times. But some people find this one a little bit
6017720	6021560	easier to remember a little easier to understand either of these methods is fine.
6023080	6030360	One last caution, don't forget at the end to check your solutions and eliminate any extraneous
6030360	6037480	solutions. These will be solutions that make the denominators of your original equations go to zero.
6038520	6044600	This video is about solving radical equations. That is equations like this one that have square
6044600	6051080	root signs in them, or cube roots or any other kind of radical. When I see an equation with a
6051080	6055960	square root in it, I really want to get rid of the square root. But it'll be easiest to get rid
6055960	6062360	of the square root. If I first isolate the square root. In other words, I want to get the term with
6062360	6067800	the square root in it on one side of the equation by itself, and everything else on the other side
6067800	6073640	of the equation. If I start with my original equation x plus the square root of x equals 12,
6074280	6080680	and I subtract x from both sides, then that does isolate the square root term on the left side
6080680	6086760	with everything else on the right. Once I've isolated the term with the square root, I'm going
6086760	6097000	to get rid of the square root. And I'll do that by squaring both sides of my equation. So I'll
6097000	6106600	take the square root of x equals 12 minus x and square both sides. Now the square root of x squared
6106600	6111720	is just x, taking the square root and then squaring those operations undo each other.
6113160	6120680	To work out 12 minus x squared, I'll write it out and distribute 12 times 12 is 144.
6121480	6128680	12 times minus x is minus 12 x. I get another minus 12 x from here.
6130280	6138200	And finally minus x times minus x is positive x squared. So I can combine my minus 12 x, so that's
6138200	6148200	minus 24 x. And now I can subtract x from both sides to get zero equals 144 minus 25 x plus x
6148200	6155160	squared. That's a quadratic equation. I'll rewrite it in a little bit more standard form here.
6156840	6162040	So now I've got a familiar quadratic equation with no radical signs left in my equation.
6162040	6167400	I'll just proceed to solve it like I usually do for a quadratic. I'll try to factor it. So I'm going
6167400	6174600	to look for two numbers that multiply to 144 and add to minus 25. Well, I know I'm going to need
6174840	6181800	negative numbers to get to negative 25. And in fact, I'll need two negative numbers. So they
6181800	6188200	still multiply to a positive number. So I'll start listing some factors of 144. I could have negative
6188200	6197480	one and a negative 144, negative two, and negative 72, negative four, negative 36, and so on.
6198360	6201240	Once I've listed out the possible factors, it's not hard to find
6202040	6209480	the two that add to negative 25. So that's negative nine and negative 16. So now I can factor my
6209480	6217800	quadratic equation as x minus nine times x minus 16 equals zero. That means that x minus nine is zero
6217800	6226040	or x minus 16 is zero. So x equals nine or x equals 16. I'm almost done. But there's one last
6226040	6233400	very important step. And that's to check the solutions so that we can eliminate any extraneous
6233400	6239720	solutions. An extraneous solution is a solution that we get that does not actually satisfy
6239720	6245160	our original equation. And extraneous solutions can happen when you're solving equations with
6245160	6251400	radicals in them. So let's first check x equals nine. If we plug in to our original equation,
6251400	6256360	we get nine plus the square root of nine and we want that to equal 12. Well, the square root of
6256360	6263400	nine is three, and nine plus three does indeed equal 12. So that solution checks out. Now let's
6263400	6269560	try x equals 16. Plugging in, we get 16 plus the square root of 16. And that's supposed to equal
6269560	6276840	12. Well, that says 16 plus four is supposed to equal 12. But that most definitely is not true.
6276840	6285400	And so x equals 16 turns out to be extraneous solution. And our only solution is x equals nine.
6307240	6334440	This next equation might not look like an equation involving radicals. But in fact, we can think
6334520	6340520	of a fractional exponent as being a radical in disguise. Let's start by doing the same thing
6340520	6347560	we did on the previous problem by isolating. This time, we'll isolate the part of the equation
6349320	6354280	that involves the fractional exponent. So I'll start with the original equation,
6354280	6359960	two times p to the fourth fifths equals one eighth, and I'll divide both sides by two,
6359960	6367080	or equivalently, I can multiply both sides by one half. That gives me p to the fourth fifths
6367080	6372760	equals one sixteenth. And I've effectively isolated the part of the equation with the
6372760	6380520	fractional exponent as much as possible. Now, in the previous example, the next step was to get rid
6380520	6386920	of the radical. In this example, we're going to get rid of the fractional exponent. And I'm going
6386920	6393320	to actually do this in two stages. First, I'm going to raise both sides to the fifth power.
6395720	6401480	That's because when I take an exponent to an exponent, I multiply my exponents,
6402120	6408120	and so that becomes just p to the fourth equals one sixteenth to the fifth power.
6408920	6415080	Now I'm going to get rid of the fourth power by raising both sides to the one fourth power
6415080	6420840	or by taking the fourth root. There's something that you need to be careful about, though, when
6420840	6428600	taking an even root, or the one over an even number power, you always have to consider
6429240	6437960	plus or minus your answer. It's kind of like when you write x squared equals four, and you
6437960	6443720	take the square root of both sides, x could equal plus or minus the square root of four, right,
6443720	6450440	x could equal plus or minus two, since minus two squared is for just as well as two squared.
6451080	6459800	So that's why when you take an even root, or a one over an even power of both sides,
6459800	6467160	you always need to include the plus or minus sign. When it's an odd root or one over an odd power,
6467160	6474520	you don't need to do that. If you had something like x cubed equals negative eight, then x equals
6474520	6479320	the cube root of negative eight, which is negative two would be your only solution. You don't need
6479320	6486040	to do the plus or minus because positive two wouldn't work. So that aside explains why we need this
6486040	6493320	plus or minus power. And now p to the four to the one fourth, when I raise a power to a power,
6493400	6499800	I multiply by exponents. So that's just p to the one, which is equal to plus or minus
6499800	6507560	one sixteenth to the fifth power to the one fourth power. Now I just need to simplify this
6507560	6513480	expression. I don't really want to raise one sixteenth to the fifth power, because 16 to the
6513480	6518760	fifth power is like a really huge number. So I think I'm actually going to rewrite this first
6519560	6529080	as p equals plus or minus one sixteenth, I'll write it back as the five fourth power again.
6530200	6534840	And as I continue to solve using my exponent rules,
6537080	6546040	I'm going to prefer to write this as one sixteenth to the fourth root to the fifth power,
6546040	6550920	because it's going to be easier to take the fourth root. Let's see the fourth root of one
6550920	6555240	sixteenth is the same thing as the fourth root of one over the fourth root of 16,
6555240	6561080	raise all that to the fifth power, fourth root of one is just one, and the fourth root of 16 is two,
6561800	6566840	raise that to the fifth power. That's just going to be one to the fifth over two to the fifth,
6566920	6569720	which is plus or minus one 30 seconds.
6572600	6580600	The last step is to check answers. So I have the two answers p equals one 30 second and p
6580600	6588680	equals minus one 30 seconds. And if I plug those both in one 30 second to the fourth fifth power,
6588680	6597800	that gives me two times one to the fourth fifth power over 32 to the fourth fifth power,
6598440	6607320	which is two times one over 32 fifth rooted to the fourth power, fifth root of 32 is two,
6607960	6614520	raise that to the fourth power, I get 16. So this is two times one sixteenth, which is one eighth,
6614520	6623480	just as we wanted in the original equation up here. Similarly, we can check that the p equals
6623480	6628520	negative one 30 second actually does satisfy the equation. I'll leave that step to the viewer.
6631800	6637400	So our two solutions are p equals one over 32 and p equals minus one over 32.
6638120	6642200	I do want to point out an alternate approach to getting rid of the fractional exponent.
6642760	6648760	We could have gotten rid of it all in one fell swoop by raising both sides of our equation
6648760	6656520	to the five fourths power. Five fourths is the reciprocal of four fifths. So when I use my
6656520	6662680	exponent rules, and say that when I raise the power to the power, I multiply my exponents,
6662680	6669240	that gives me p to the four fifths times five fourths is plus or minus one sixteenth to the
6669240	6676680	five fourths. In other words, p to the one power, which is just p is plus or minus one sixteenth
6676680	6682520	to the five fourths. So that's an alternate and possibly faster way to get to the solution.
6682520	6687640	Once again, the plus or minus comes from the fact that when we take the five fourth power,
6687640	6693560	we're really taking an even root of fourth root. And so we need to consider both positive and
6693560	6700280	negative answers. This video is about solving radical equations, that is equations like this one
6701000	6705320	that have square root signs in them, or cube roots or any other kind of radical.
6706840	6714120	In this video, we solved radical equations by first isolating the radical sign or the fractional
6714120	6723880	exponent, and then removing the radical sign or the fractional exponent by either squaring
6723880	6732200	both sides or taking the reciprocal power of both sides. This video is about solving inequalities
6732200	6737960	that have absolute value signs in them. Let's look at the inequality absolute value of x is
6737960	6743560	less than five on the number line. Thinking of absolute value as distance, this means that the
6743560	6751080	distance between x and zero is less than five units. So x has to live somewhere in between
6751080	6758840	negative five and five. We can express this as an inequality without absolute value signs
6758840	6765880	by saying negative five is less than x, which is less than five, or we can use interval notation,
6765880	6772920	soft bracket, negative five, five, soft bracket. Both of these formulations are equivalent to
6772920	6779320	the original one, but don't involve the absolute value signs. In the second example, we're looking
6779320	6784920	for the values of x for which the absolute value of x is greater than or equal to five.
6786360	6792920	On the number line, this means that the distance of x from the zero is got to be
6792920	6799560	bigger than or equal to five units. A distance bigger than five units means that x has to live
6799560	6805880	somewhere over here, or somewhere over here, where it's farther than five units away from zero.
6806760	6812600	Of course, x could also have a distance equal to five units. So I'll fill in that dot and
6812600	6819560	shade in the other parts of the number line that satisfy my inequality. Now I can rewrite the
6819560	6825880	inequality without the absolute value symbols by saying that x is less than or equal to negative
6825880	6832680	five, or x is greater than or equal to five. I could also write this in interval notation,
6834040	6841480	soft bracket, negative infinity, negative five, hard bracket. And the second part is hard bracket,
6841480	6848680	five, infinity, soft bracket. I combine these with a U for union, because I'm trying to describe
6848680	6854760	all these points on the number line together with all these other points. Let's take this analysis
6854760	6859960	a step further with a slightly more complicated problem. Now I want the absolute value of three
6859960	6868040	minus two t to be less than four. An absolute value less than four means a distance less than four on
6868040	6874200	the number line. But it's not the variable t that lives in here at a distance of less than four from
6874200	6884920	zero. It's the whole expression three minus two t. So three minus two t lives somewhere in here. And
6884920	6892920	I can rewrite this as an inequality without absolute value signs by saying negative four is less than
6892920	6899880	three minus two t is less than four. Now I have a compound inequality that I can solve the usual
6899880	6906360	way. First, I'll subtract three from all three sides to get negative seven is less than negative
6906360	6913960	two t is less than one. And now I'll divide all three sides by negative two. Since negative two
6913960	6922600	is a negative number, this reverses the directions of the inequalities. Simplifying I get seven halves
6922600	6929080	is greater than t is greater than negative one half. So my final answer on the number line
6929080	6933640	looks like all the stuff between negative a half and seven halves,
6935560	6941240	but not including the endpoints and an interval notation I can write this soft bracket negative
6941240	6946920	a half seven halves soft bracket. Please pause the video and try the next problem on your own.
6948120	6953800	Thinking in terms of distance, this inequality says that the distance between the expression
6953800	6960120	three minus two t and zero is always bigger than four. Let me draw this on the number line.
6961400	6968440	If three minus two t has a distance bigger than four from zero, then it can't be in this region
6968440	6973160	that's near zero, it has to be on the outside in one of these two regions.
6974840	6982840	That is, three minus two t is either less than negative four, or three minus two t is bigger than
6982840	6988920	four. I'll solve these two inequalities separately. The first one subtracting three from both sides,
6988920	6996680	I get negative two t is less than negative seven, dividing by negative two, I get t is
6996680	7003720	bigger than seven halves. And then on the other side, I get negative two t is greater than one.
7003720	7010840	So t is less than negative one half. I had to flip inequalities in the last step
7010920	7015720	due to dividing by a negative number. So let's check this out on the number line again.
7016360	7023400	The first piece says that t is greater than seven halves. I'll draw that over here.
7025000	7031640	And the second piece says that t is less than negative one half. I'll draw that down here.
7034600	7039800	Because these two statements are joined with an or, I'm looking for the t values
7039800	7045400	that are in this one, or in this one. That is, I want both of these regions put together.
7046120	7052680	So an interval notation, this reads negative infinity to negative one half soft bracket union
7053240	7059640	soft bracket seven halves to infinity. This last example looks more complicated.
7059640	7065400	But if I simplify first and isolate the absolute value part, it looks pretty much like the previous
7065400	7072200	ones. So I'll start by subtracting seven from both sides. And then I'll divide both sides by two.
7073000	7080840	Now I'll draw my number line. And I'm looking for this expression for x plus five to always have
7080840	7087000	distance greater than or equal to negative three from zero. Wait a second distance greater than
7087000	7090600	equal to negative three. Well distance is always greater than or equal to negative three, it's
7090600	7099160	always greater than or equal to zero. So this in fact is always true. And so the answer to my
7099160	7107240	inequality is all numbers between negative infinity and infinity. In other words, all real numbers.
7109560	7113160	When solving absolute value inequalities, it's good to think about distance.
7114120	7122040	An absolute value of something that's less than a number means that whatever's inside the absolute
7122040	7130600	value signs is close to zero. On the other hand, an absolute value of something being greater than
7130600	7137000	a number means that whatever's inside the absolute value sign is far away from zero.
7137000	7144760	Because its distance from zero is bigger than a certain number. Drawing these pictures on the
7144760	7151160	number line is a helpful way to rewrite the absolute value inequality as an inequality that
7151160	7157400	doesn't contain an absolute value sign. In this case, it would be negative three is less than x
7157400	7164920	plus two is less than three. And the other case, it would be either x plus two is less than negative
7164920	7172840	three or x plus two is greater than three. This video is about solving linear inequalities.
7172840	7179800	Those are inequalities like this one that involve a variable here x, but don't involve any x squared
7179800	7186360	or other higher power terms. The good news is, we can solve linear inequalities just like we'd
7186360	7192520	solve linear equations by distributing, adding and subtracting terms to both sides and multiplying
7192520	7197960	and dividing by numbers on both sides. The only thing that's different is that if you
7198600	7204920	multiply or divide by a negative number, then you need to reverse the direction of the inequality.
7205800	7211800	For example, if we had the inequality negative x is less than negative five, and we wanted to
7211800	7219000	multiply both sides by negative one to get rid of the negative signs, we'd have to also switch
7219000	7224120	or reverse the inequality. With this caution in mind, let's look at our first example.
7225400	7230360	Since our variable x is trapped in parentheses, I'll distribute the negative five to free it from
7230360	7236600	the parentheses. That gives me negative five x minus 10 plus three is greater than eight.
7238360	7244360	Negative 10 plus three is negative seven. So I'll rewrite this as negative five x minus seven is
7244360	7251880	greater than eight. Now I'll add seven to both sides to get negative five x is greater than 15.
7252840	7258520	Now I'd like to divide both sides by negative five, since negative five is a negative number
7258520	7266280	that reverses the inequality. So I get x is less than 15 divided by negative five. In other words,
7266280	7273320	x is less than negative three. If I wanted to graph this on a number line, I just need to put down
7273320	7280760	a negative three, an open circle around it, and shade into the left. I use an open circle
7280760	7286280	because x is strictly less than negative three and can't equal negative three. If I wanted to
7286280	7291640	write this in interval notation, I've read it as soft bracket, negative infinity, negative three,
7291640	7296760	soft bracket. Again, the soft bracket is because the negative three is not included.
7297720	7305240	This next example is an example of a compound inequality. It has two parts. Either this statement
7305240	7310920	is true or this statement is true. I want to find the values of x that satisfy either one.
7311880	7316600	I'll solve this by working out each part separately and then combining them at the end.
7317480	7323720	For the inequality on the left, I'll copy it over here. I'm going to add four to both sides,
7324680	7331640	then subtract x from both sides, and then divide both sides by two.
7333960	7337640	I didn't have to reverse the inequality sign because I divided by a positive number.
7338840	7345720	On the right side, I'll copy the equation over, subtract one from both sides, and divide both
7345720	7353160	sides by six. Nine, six is the same as three halves. Now I'm looking for the x values that make
7353160	7358840	this statement true or make this statement true. Let me graph this on a number line.
7361000	7368280	x is less than or equal to negative two means I put a filled in circle there and graph everything
7368280	7377080	to the left. x is greater than three halves means I put an empty circle here and shade in everything
7377080	7386600	to the right. My final answer includes both of these pieces, which I'll reshade in green because
7386600	7391960	x is allowed to be in either one or the other. Finally, I can write this in interval notation.
7392680	7397560	The first piece on the number line can be described as soft bracket negative infinity
7398280	7405640	negative two hard bracket. And the second piece can be described as soft bracket three halves
7405640	7413080	infinity soft bracket. To indicate that x can be in either one of these pieces, I use the union sign,
7413080	7421240	which is a U. That means that my answer includes all x values in here together with all x values in
7421240	7428760	here. This next example is also a compound inequality, this time joined by an and the and
7428760	7435880	means I'm looking for all y values that satisfy both this and this at the same time. Again,
7435880	7444840	I can solve each piece separately. On the left, to isolate the y, I need to multiply by negative
7444840	7453400	three halves on both sides. So that gives me y is less than negative 12 times negative three halves,
7453400	7459720	the greater than flipped to a less than because I was multiplying by negative three halves,
7459720	7466680	which is a negative number. If I clean up the right side to get y is less than 18.
7467080	7474760	On the right side, I'll start by subtracting two from both sides. And now I'll divide by negative
7474760	7483400	four, again, a negative number so that flips the inequality. So that's y is less than three over
7483400	7489800	negative four, in other words, y is less than negative three fourths. Again, I'm looking for the y
7490760	7497800	values that make both of these statements true at the same time. Let me graph this on the number line.
7500840	7507080	The y is less than 18. I can graph that by drawing the number 18.
7508680	7513080	I don't want to include it. So I use an empty circle and I shaded everything to the left.
7513400	7519480	The statement y is less than negative three fourths, I need to draw in negative three fourths.
7519480	7527560	And again, I don't include it, but I do include everything on the left. Since I want the y values
7527560	7533400	for which both of these statements are true, I need the y values that are in both colored blue
7533400	7540120	and colored red. And so that would be this part right here. I'll just draw it above so you can
7540120	7547480	see it easily. So that would be all the numbers from negative three fourths and lower, not including
7547480	7552040	negative three fourths. Since those are the parts of the number line that have both red and blue
7552040	7557880	colors on them. In interval notation, my final answer will be soft bracket negative infinity
7558520	7565320	to negative three fourths soft bracket. As my final example, I have an inequality
7565880	7571400	that has two inequality signs in it negative three is less than or equal to six x minus two is less
7571400	7578280	than 10. I can think of this as being a compound inequality with two parts negative three x is
7578280	7585400	less than or equal to six x minus two. And at the same time, six x minus two is less than 10.
7586200	7591960	I could solve this in two pieces as before. But instead, it's a little more efficient to just solve
7592040	7600280	it all at once by doing the same thing to all three sides. So as a first step, I'll add two to
7600280	7607400	all three sides. That gives me negative one is less than equal to six x is less than 12. And now
7607400	7613720	I'm going to divide all three sides by six to isolate the x. So that gives me negative one six
7613720	7620760	is less than or equal to x is less than two. If we'd solved it instead in two pieces above,
7620840	7626040	we'd end up with the same thing. Because we get negative one six is less than or equal to x from
7626040	7632680	this piece. And we get x is less than two on this piece. And because of the and statement, that's
7632680	7637160	the same thing as saying negative one six is less than or equal to x, which is less than two.
7638600	7644280	Either way we do it. Let's see if what it looks like on the number line. So on the number line,
7644280	7653800	we're looking for things that are between two and negative one six, including the negative one six,
7653800	7659960	but not including the two. In interval notation, we can write this as hard bracket negative one six
7660520	7667800	to soft bracket. In this video, we solved linear inequalities, including some compound inequalities
7667800	7675000	joined by the conjunctions and and or. Remember, when we're working with and we're looking for
7675000	7681800	places on the number line, where both statements are true. That is, we're looking for the overlap
7681800	7689240	on the number line. In this case, the points on the number line that are colored both red and blue
7689240	7695880	at the same time. When we're working with or statements, we're looking for places where
7695880	7701000	either one or the other statement is true or both. On the number line,
7702760	7708520	this corresponds to points that are colored either red or blue or both. And in this picture,
7708520	7714920	that would actually correspond to the entire number line. In this video, we'll solve inequalities
7714920	7720920	involving polynomials like this one, and inequalities involving rational expressions like this one.
7721800	7728520	Let's start with a simple example, maybe a deceptively simple example. If you see the inequality
7728520	7734760	x squared is less than four, you might be very tempted to take the square root of both sides and
7734760	7740920	get something like x is less than two as your answer. But in fact, that doesn't work.
7741320	7751480	To see why it's not correct, consider the x value of negative 10. Negative 10 satisfies
7752680	7760520	the inequality x is less than two, since negative 10 is less than two, but it doesn't satisfy the
7760520	7768920	inequality x squared is less than four, since negative 10 squared is 100, which is not less than
7768920	7776200	four. So these two inequalities are not the same. And it doesn't work to solve a quadratic
7776200	7781480	inequality just to take the square root of both sides. You might be thinking part of why this
7781480	7787400	reasoning is wrong is we've ignored the negative two option, right? If we had the equation x squared
7787400	7793640	equals four, then x equals two would just be one option, x equals negative two would be another
7793640	7799320	solution. So somehow our solution to this inequality should take this into account.
7800440	7806120	In fact, a good way to solve an inequality involving x squared or higher power terms
7806120	7812360	is to solve the associated equation first. But before we even do that, I like to pull
7812360	7816680	everything over to one side so that my inequality has zero on the other side.
7817000	7822680	So for our equation, I'll subtract four from both sides to get x squared minus four is less than
7822680	7830200	zero. Now, I'm going to actually solve the associated equation, x squared minus four is equal
7830200	7839080	to zero. I can do this by factoring to x minus two times x plus two is equal to zero. And I'll set
7839560	7845560	my factors equal to zero, and I get x equals two and x equals minus two.
7847000	7852520	Now, I'm going to plot the solutions to my equation on the number line. So I write down negative two
7852520	7858040	and two. Those are the places where my expression x squared minus four is equal to zero.
7859800	7864440	Since I want to find where x squared minus four is less than zero, I want to know where
7864440	7870120	this expression x squared minus four is positive or negative. A good way to find that out is to
7870120	7876680	plug in test values. So first I'll plug in a test value in this area of the number line,
7877240	7883720	something less than negative two say x equals negative three. If I plug in negative three
7883720	7890600	into x squared minus four, I get negative three squared minus four, which is nine minus four,
7890600	7897960	which is five. That's a positive number. So at negative three, the expression x squared minus
7897960	7903800	four is positive. And in fact, everywhere on this region of the number line, my expression is going
7903800	7908760	to be positive, because it can't jump from positive to negative without going through a place where
7908760	7914680	it's zero. I can figure out whether x squared minus four is positive or negative on this region,
7914680	7918520	and on this region of the number line, by plugging in test values similarly.
7919800	7926040	A value to plug in between negative two and two, a nice value is x equals zero, zero squared minus
7926040	7931240	four, that's negative four, a negative number. So I know that my expression x squared minus four
7931240	7937720	is negative on this whole interval. Finally, I can plug in something like x equals 10, something
7937720	7944280	bigger than two, and I get 10 squared minus four. Without even computing that, I can tell that that's
7944280	7949000	going to be a positive number. And that's all that's important. Again, since I want x squared
7949000	7953800	minus four to be less than zero, I'm looking for the places on this number line, where I'm getting
7953800	7960280	negatives. So I'll shade that in on my number line, it's in here, not including the endpoints,
7960280	7964680	because the endpoints are where my expression x squared minus four is equal to zero, and I want
7964680	7971880	it strictly less than zero. I can write my answer as an inequality, negative two is less than x is
7971960	7978120	less than two, or an interval notation as soft bracket negative two to soft bracket.
7979800	7985640	Our next example, we can solve similarly. First, we'll move everything to one side,
7986440	7993800	so that our inequality is x cubed minus five x squared minus six x is greater than or equal to
7993800	8002200	zero. Next, we'll solve the associated equation by factoring. So first, I'll write down the equation.
8003000	8010680	Now I'll factor out an x. And now I'll factor the quadratic. So the solutions to my equation
8010680	8017080	are x equals zero x equals six and x equals negative one. I'll write the solutions to the
8017080	8029720	equation on the number line. So that's negative one, zero, and six. That's where my expression x times
8029720	8039960	x minus six times x plus one is equal to zero. But I want to find where it's greater than or equal
8039960	8047080	to zero. So again, I can use test values. I can plug in, for example, x equals negative two,
8047080	8052840	either to this version of expression, or to this factored version. Since I only care whether my
8052840	8057720	answer is positive or negative, it's sometimes easier to use the factored version. For example,
8057720	8067400	when x is negative two, this factor is negative. But this factor x minus six is also negative
8067400	8075720	when I plug in negative two for x. Finally, x plus one, when I plug in negative two for x,
8075720	8080280	that's negative one, that's also negative. And a negative times a negative times a negative
8080280	8088600	gives me a negative number. If I plug in something between negative one and zero, say x equals negative
8088600	8094920	one half, then I'm going to get a negative for this factor, a negative for this factor,
8094920	8101560	but a positive for this third factor. Negative times negative times positive gives me a positive.
8103240	8111800	For a test value between zero and six, let's try x equals one. Now I'll get a positive for
8111800	8119080	this factor, a negative for this factor, and a positive for this factor. Positive times a negative
8119080	8126200	times a positive gives me a negative. Finally, for a test value bigger than six, we could use
8126200	8135000	say x equals 100. That's going to give me positive, positive, positive. So my product will be positive.
8137160	8142760	Since I want values where my expression is greater than or equal to zero, I want the places where it
8142760	8154520	equals zero and the places where it's positive. So my final answer will be close bracket negative
8154520	8163240	one to zero close bracket union close bracket six to infinity. As our final example, let's consider
8163240	8170760	the rational inequality x squared plus six x plus nine divided by x minus one is less than or equal
8170760	8177400	to zero. Although it might be tempting to clear the denominator and multiply both sides by x minus
8177400	8183720	one, it's dangerous to do that, because x minus one could be a positive number, but it could also
8183720	8188360	be a negative number. And when you multiply both sides by a negative number, you have to reverse
8188360	8195000	the inequality. Although it's possible to solve the inequality this way by thinking of cases where
8195000	8200280	x minus one is less than zero or better than zero, I think it's much easier just to solve the same
8200280	8207240	way as we did before. So we'll start by rewriting so that we move all terms to the left and have zero
8207240	8213560	on the right. Well, that's already true. So the next step would be to solve the associated equation.
8216120	8221800	That is x squared plus six x plus nine over x minus one is equal to zero.
8222520	8229080	That would be where the numerator zero x squared plus six x plus nine is equal to zero. So where x plus
8229080	8236840	three squared is zero or x equals negative three. There's one extra step we have to do for rational
8236840	8243080	expressions. And that's what we need to find where the expression does not exist. That is,
8243080	8250360	let's find where the denominator is zero and that's at x equals one. I'll put all those numbers on
8250760	8257160	the number line, the places where my rational expression is equal to zero, and the place where
8257160	8264120	my rational expression doesn't exist. Then I can start in with test values. For example, x equals
8264120	8274200	minus four, zero and two work. If I plug those values into this expression here, I get a negative
8274280	8279960	answer, a negative answer and a positive answer. The reason I need to conclude the values on my
8279960	8286520	number line where my denominator zero is because I can my expression can switch from negative to
8286520	8292920	positive by passing through a place where my rational expression doesn't exist, as well as
8292920	8298280	passing by passing through a place where my rational expression is equal to zero. Now I'm
8298280	8303800	looking for where my original expression was less than or equal to zero. So that means I want the
8303800	8311080	places on the number line where my expression is equal to zero, and also the places where it's
8311080	8320360	negative. So my final answer is x is less than one or an interval notation negative infinity to one.
8322280	8328200	In this video, we solved polynomial and rational inequalities by making a number line
8328200	8336040	and using test values to make a sign chart. The distance formula can be used to find the
8336040	8343640	distance between two points if we know their coordinates. If this first point has coordinates
8343640	8352040	x one, y one, and the second point has coordinates x two, y two, then the distance between them
8352040	8361320	is given by the formula, the square root of x two minus x one squared plus y two minus y one
8361320	8368840	squared. This formula actually comes from the Pythagorean theorem. Let me draw a right triangle
8369400	8372360	with these two points as two of its vertices.
8372600	8382760	Then the length of this side is the difference between the two x coordinates. Similarly, the
8382760	8389320	length of this vertical side is the difference between the two y coordinates. Now the Pythagorean
8389320	8395960	theorem says that for any right triangle with sides labeled A and B and hypotenuse labeled C,
8396760	8403800	we have that A squared plus B squared equals C squared. Well, if we apply that to this triangle
8403800	8410200	here, this hypotenuse is the distance between the two points that we're looking for.
8411640	8420200	So Pythagorean theorem says the square of this side length, that is x two minus x one squared
8420920	8427800	plus the square of this side length, which is y two minus y one squared
8428600	8436920	has to equal the square of the hypotenuse, that is D squared. Taking the square root of both sides
8436920	8444360	of this equation, we get the square root of x two minus x one squared plus y two minus y one
8444360	8450680	squared is equal to D. We don't have to worry about using plus or minus signs when we take the
8450680	8457960	square root because distance is always positive. So we've derived our distance formula. Now let's
8457960	8467320	use it in an example. Let's find the distance between the two points negative one five, negative one
8467560	8477880	five, maybe over here, and four two. This notation just means that P is the point with
8477880	8483960	coordinates negative one five. And Q is the point with coordinates four two.
8486360	8493640	We have the distance formula. Let's think of P being the point with coordinates x one y one
8493640	8500520	and Q being the point with coordinates x two y two. But as we'll see, it really doesn't matter
8500520	8510680	which one is which. Plugging into our formula, we get D is the square root of x two minus x one.
8510680	8527320	So that's four minus negative one squared. And then we add y two minus y one. So that's two minus
8527320	8535240	five squared. Working out the arithmetic a little bit four minus negative one, that's four plus one
8535240	8542840	or five squared plus negative three squared. So that's the square root of 25 plus nine,
8542840	8549880	or the square root of 34. Let's see what would have happened if we'd called this first point
8550760	8558360	x two y two instead and the second point x one y one. Then we would have gotten the same distance
8558360	8569400	formula. But we would have taken negative one minus four. And added the difference of y squared.
8569400	8578920	So that's y two five minus two squared. So that gives us the square root of negative five squared
8578920	8587560	plus three squared, which works out to the same thing. In this video, we use the distance formula
8587560	8592520	to find the distance between two points. When writing down the distance formula, sometimes
8592520	8597480	students forget whether this is a plus or minus and whether these are pluses or minuses. One way
8597480	8602440	to remember is to think that the distance formula comes from the Pythagorean theorem. That's why
8602440	8609560	there's a plus in here. And then a minus in here because we're getting the difference between the
8609560	8615960	coordinates to find the lengths of the sides. The midpoint formula helps us find the coordinates
8615960	8621800	of the midpoint of a line segment, as long as we know the coordinates of the endpoints.
8623400	8629400	So let's call the coordinates of this endpoint x one y one, and the coordinates of this other
8629400	8638600	endpoint x two y two. The x coordinate of the midpoint is going to be exactly halfway in between
8638600	8644200	the x coordinates of the endpoints. To get a number halfway in between two other numbers,
8644200	8645400	we just take the average.
8650360	8655880	Similarly, the y coordinate of this midpoint is going to be exactly halfway in between
8655880	8661480	the y coordinates of the endpoints. So the y coordinate of the midpoint is going to be the
8661480	8669160	average of those y coordinates. So we see that the coordinates of the midpoint
8670120	8675960	are x one plus x two over two, y one plus y two over two.
8677560	8684760	Let's use this midpoint formula in an example. We want to find the midpoint of the segment
8684760	8694920	between the points negative one, five, and four, two.
8697640	8703160	Let me draw the line segment between them. So visually the midpoint is going to be somewhere
8703160	8709800	around here. But to find its exact coordinates, we're going to use x one plus x two over two,
8709800	8715080	and y one plus y two over two, where this first point is coordinates
8716280	8723320	x one y one. And the second point has coordinates x two y two. It doesn't actually matter which
8723320	8728040	point you decide is x one y one and which one is x two y two. The formula will still give you
8728040	8735160	the same answer for the midpoint. So let's see I take my average of my x coordinates. So that's
8736120	8744280	negative one plus four over two, and the average of my y coordinates. So that's five plus two over
8744280	8755080	two. And I get three halves, seven halves, as the coordinates of my midpoint. In this video,
8755080	8760360	we use the midpoint formula to find the midpoint of a line segment, just by taking the average
8760440	8765640	of the x coordinates and the average of the y coordinates. This video is about graphs and
8765640	8773560	equations of circles. Suppose we want to find the equation of a circle of radius five centered at the
8773560	8785720	point three two. It'll look something like this. For any point x y on the circle, we know that
8785880	8793080	that the distance of that point x y from the center is equal to the radius, that is five.
8794200	8801240	From the distance formula, that distance of five is equal to the square root of the difference of
8801240	8812040	the x coordinates. That's x minus three squared, plus the difference of the y coordinates, that's
8812040	8823720	y minus two squared. And if I square both sides of that equation, I get five squared is this square
8823720	8833160	root squared. In other words, 25 is equal to x minus three squared plus y minus two squared,
8833160	8840360	since the square root and the squared undo each other. A lot of times people will write the x minus
8840360	8845880	three squared plus y minus two squared on the left side of the equation and the 25 on the right
8845880	8852600	side of the equation. This is the standard form for the equation of this circle. The same reasoning
8852600	8859000	can be generalized to find the general equation for a circle with radius r centered at a point hk.
8860680	8868840	For any point with coordinates x y on the circle, the distance between the point with coordinates
8868840	8876920	x y and the point with coordinates hk is equal to the radius r. So we have that the distance
8876920	8883240	is equal to r, but by the distance formula, that's the square root of the difference between the x
8883240	8892760	coordinates, x minus h squared, plus the difference in the y coordinates, y minus k squared.
8892760	8903000	Squaring both sides as before, we get r squared is the square root squared, canceling the square root
8903000	8911240	and the squared and rearranging the equation that gives us x minus h squared plus y minus k squared
8911240	8918760	equals r squared. That's the general formula for a circle with radius r and center hk.
8918760	8927240	Notice that the coordinates h and k are subtracted here. The two squares are added because they are
8927240	8933000	in the distance formula and the radius is squared on the other side. If you remember this general
8933000	8938920	formula, that makes it easy to write down the equation for a circle. For example, if we want the
8938920	8952680	equation for a circle of radius six and center at zero negative three, then we have r equals six
8953320	8965880	and hk is our zero negative three. So plugging into the formula, we get x minus zero squared plus
8965880	8975160	y minus negative three squared equals six squared, or simplified, this is x squared plus y plus three
8975160	8983160	squared equals 36. Suppose we're given an equation like this one, and we want to decide if it's the
8983160	8990120	equation of a circle. And if so, what's the center and what's the radius? Well, this equation matches
8990120	8997000	the form for a circle x minus h squared plus y minus k squared equals r squared.
8997000	9005240	If we let h be five, y be negative six, since that way, subtracting a negative six is like
9005240	9013560	adding a six. Five must be our r squared. So that means that r is the square root of five.
9014360	9023000	So this is our radius. And our center is the point five negative six. And this is indeed
9023000	9029000	the equation for a circle, which we could then graph by putting down the center
9030040	9033160	and estimating the radius, which is a little bit more than two.
9036520	9041640	This equation might not look like the equation of a circle, but it actually can be transformed
9042360	9047640	to look like the equation of a circle. We're trying to make it look like something of the form
9047640	9055640	x minus h squared plus y minus k squared equals r squared. First, I'd like to get rid of the
9055640	9059880	coefficients in front of the x squared and the y squared. So I'm going to divide everything by nine.
9060760	9069800	This gives me x squared plus y squared plus eight x minus two y plus four equals zero. Next,
9069800	9075480	I'm going to group the x terms together, the x squared and the eight x. So I'll write x squared
9075480	9080440	plus eight x. I'll group the y terms together, the y squared minus two y.
9082600	9086280	And I'll subtract the four over to the other side.
9088360	9092520	This still doesn't look much like the equation of a circle. But as the next step,
9092520	9097240	I'm going to do something called completing the square. I'm going to take this coefficient
9097240	9105080	of x eight, divide it by two and then square it. In other words, eight over two squared,
9105080	9111080	that's four squared, which is 16. I'm going to add 16 to both sides of my equation.
9112920	9120680	So add the 16 here. And on the other side. Now I'm going to do the same thing to the
9120680	9129560	coefficient of y negative two divided by two is negative one square that and I get one. So now I'm
9129560	9137000	going to add a one to both sides, but I'll put it near the y terms. So add a one there. And then
9137000	9142520	to keep things balanced, I have to add it to the other side. On the right side, I have the number
9142520	9149640	13. On the left side, I can wrap up this expression x squared plus eight x plus 16
9150440	9159640	into x plus four squared. To convince you that's correct. If we multiply out x plus four times x
9159640	9168360	plus four, we get x squared plus four x plus four x plus 16, or x squared plus eight x plus 16,
9168360	9176920	the same thing we have right here. Similarly, we can wrap up y squared minus two y plus one as
9178840	9186440	y minus one squared. Again, I'll work out the distribution down here. That's y squared minus
9186440	9192040	y minus y plus one or y squared minus two y plus one, just like we have up here.
9192440	9200360	If you're wondering how I knew to use four and minus one, the four came from taking half of eight,
9200360	9206760	and the minus one came from taking half the negative two. Now we have an equation for a
9206760	9214840	circle in standard form. And we can read off the center, which is negative four, negative one,
9215480	9225640	and the radius, which is the square root of 13. It might seem like magic that this trick of taking
9225640	9231080	half of this coefficient and squaring it and adding it to both sides, let's us wrap up this
9231080	9237080	expression into this expression, that's perfect square. But to see why that works, let's take a
9237080	9243560	look at what happens if we expand out x minus h squared, the thing that we're trying to get to.
9245400	9253480	So if we expand that out, x minus h squared, which is x minus h times x minus h is,
9254360	9264520	which multiplies out to x squared minus hx minus hx plus h squared, or x squared minus two hx plus
9264520	9273720	h squared. Now if we start out with this part, with some x squared term and some coefficient of x,
9273720	9279320	and we're trying to decide what to add on in order to wrap it up into x minus h squared,
9279320	9286440	the thing to add on is h squared here, which comes from half of this coefficient squared,
9286440	9291880	right, because half of negative two h is eight negative h, square that you get the h squared.
9291880	9299240	And then when we do wrap it up, it's half of this coefficient of x that appears right here.
9299240	9304840	This trick of completing the square is really handy for turning an equation for a circle in
9304840	9310920	disguise into the standard equation for the circle. In this video, we found the standard
9310920	9319080	equation for a circle, x minus h squared plus y minus k squared equals r squared, where r is the
9319080	9330680	radius, and hk is the center. We also showed a method of completing the square. When you have
9330680	9337720	an equation for a circle in disguise, completing the square will help you rewrite it into the standard
9337720	9346840	form. This video is about graphs and equations of lines. Here we're given the graph of a line,
9346840	9354360	we want to find the equation. One standard format for the equation of a line is y equals mx plus b.
9355400	9365000	Here m represents the slope and b represents the y intercept, the y value where the line crosses
9365000	9373720	the y axis. The slope is equal to the rise over the run, or sometimes this is written as the change
9373720	9383320	in y values over the change in x values, or in other words, y2 minus y1 over x2 minus x1, where
9384200	9393160	x1, y1, and x2, y2 are points on the line. While we could use any two points on the line to find
9393160	9399400	the slope, it's convenient to use points where the x and y coordinates are integers, that is
9399400	9405800	points where the line passes through grid points. So here would be one convenient point to use,
9405800	9413160	and here's another convenient point to use. The coordinates of the first point are one, two,
9413160	9420040	and the next point, this is, let's see, five, negative one. Now I can find the slope by looking
9420040	9428200	at the rise over the run. So as I go through a run of this distance, I go through a rise of that
9428200	9433320	distance, it's actually going to be a negative rise or a fall because my line is pointing down.
9433320	9438920	So let's see, counting off squares, this is a run of one, two, three, four squares and a rise of
9439560	9447960	one, two, three, so negative three. So my slope is going to be negative three over four.
9449800	9453880	I got that answer by counting squares, but I could have also gotten it by
9453880	9458200	looking at the difference in my y values over the difference in my x values.
9458200	9467080	That is, I could have done negative one minus two, that's from my difference in y values,
9467080	9476280	and divide that by my difference in x values, which is five minus one, that gives me negative three
9476280	9487000	over four as before. So my m is negative three fourths. Now I need to figure out the value of b,
9487000	9493240	my y intercept. Well, I could just read it off the graph, it looks like approximately 2.75,
9493240	9498200	but if I want to be more accurate, I can again use a point that has integer coordinates that I know
9498200	9505160	its exact coordinates. So either this point or that point, let's try this point. And I can start
9505160	9513320	off with my equation y equals mx plus b, that is y equals negative three fourths x plus b,
9513320	9525000	and I can plug in the point one two for my x and y. So that gives me two equals negative three fourths
9525000	9532360	times one plus b, solving for b, let's see that's two equals negative three fourths plus b,
9532920	9539880	so add three fourths to both sides, that's two plus three fourths equals b. So b is
9540920	9546440	eight fourths plus three fourths, which is 11 fourths, which is actually just what I eyeballed it
9546440	9555160	to be. So now I can write out my final equation for my line y equals negative three fourths x plus
9555160	9562280	11 fourths by plugging in for m and b. Next, let's find the equation for this horizontal line.
9563960	9569960	A horizontal line has slope zero. So if we think of it as y equals mx plus b,
9570600	9577560	m is going to be zero. In other words, it's just y equals b, y is some constant. So if we can figure
9577560	9584920	out what that that constant y value is, it looks like it's two, let's see that's three,
9584920	9589960	three and a half, we can just write down the equation directly, y equals 3.5.
9592520	9598840	For a vertical line, like this one, it doesn't really have a slope. I mean, if you tried to do
9598840	9605880	the rise over the run, there's no run. So I guess you'd be dividing by zero and get an infinite slope.
9605880	9612600	But but instead, we just think of it as an equation of the form x equals something.
9613240	9619320	And in this case, x equals negative two. Notice that all of the points on our line have the same
9619320	9625000	x coordinate of negative two and the y coordinate can be anything. So this is how we write the
9625000	9632120	equation for a vertical line. In this example, we're not shown a graph of the line, we're just
9632120	9637640	told that it goes through two points. But knowing that it goes through two points is enough to find
9637640	9645640	the equation for the line. First, we can find the slope by taking the difference in y values
9645640	9653400	over the difference in x values. So that's negative three minus two over four minus one,
9653400	9662520	which is negative five thirds. So we can use the standard equation for the line,
9662520	9671000	this is called the slope intercept form. And we can plug in negative five thirds.
9671640	9678120	And we can use one point, either one will do, we'll still get the same final answer. So let's
9678120	9687400	use one two and plug that in to get two equals negative five thirds times one plus B. And so B is
9688280	9695800	two plus five thirds, which is six thirds plus five thirds, which is 11 thirds. So our equation
9695800	9707560	is y equals negative five thirds x plus 11 thirds. This is method one. Method two uses a slightly
9707640	9714200	different form of the equation. It's called the point slope form. And it goes y minus y not
9714200	9724280	is equal to m times x minus x not, where x not y not is a point on the line. And am again is the
9724280	9731080	slope. So we calculate the slope the same way, by taking a difference in y values over difference
9731080	9742200	in x values. But then we can simply plug in any point. For example, the point one two will work,
9742200	9751320	we can plug one in for x not and two in for y not in this point slope form, that gives us y
9751640	9761560	minus two is equal to minus five thirds x minus one. Notice that these two equations while they may
9761560	9767880	look different are actually equivalent. Because if I distribute the negative five thirds, and then
9768040	9770600	and then add the two to both sides,
9778920	9781560	I get the same equation as above.
9785160	9790680	So we've seen two ways of finding the equation for the line, using the slope intercept form
9790760	9799160	and using the point slope form. In this video, we saw that you can find the equation for a line
9799160	9807960	if you know the slope. And you know one point. You can also find the equation for the line if
9807960	9815240	you know two points, because you can use the two points to get the slope, and then plug in one of
9815240	9821720	those points to figure out the rest of the equation. We saw two standard forms for the
9821720	9830360	equation of a line. The slope intercept form y equals mx plus b, where m is the slope, and b is the
9830360	9841080	y intercept. And the point slope form y minus y not equals m times x minus x not, where m again
9841080	9851240	is the slope, and x not y not is a point on the line. This video is about finding parallel and
9851240	9859400	perpendicular lines. Suppose we have a line of slope three fourths, in other words, the rise
9859640	9870840	over the run is three over four. Then any other line that's parallel to this line will have the same
9870840	9880840	slope, the same rise over run. So that's our first fact to keep in mind. Parallel lines have the same
9880840	9887480	slopes. Suppose on the other hand, we want to find a line perpendicular to our original line with
9888440	9896920	its original slope of three fourths. A perpendicular line, in other words, a line at a 90 degree
9896920	9903560	angle to our original line, will have a slope that's the negative reciprocal, the opposite
9903560	9910520	reciprocal of our original slope. So we take the reciprocal of three fourths, that's four thirds,
9910520	9916760	and we make it its opposite by changing it from positive to negative. So I'll write this as a
9916760	9924760	principle that perpendicular lines have opposite reciprocal slopes. To get the hang of what it
9924760	9930760	means to be an opposite reciprocal, let's look at a few examples. So here's the original slope,
9930760	9936440	and this will be the opposite reciprocal, which would represent the slope of our perpendicular
9936440	9943080	line. So for example, if m1 was two, then the opposite reciprocal, the reciprocal of two is
9943080	9951160	one half opposite means I changed the sign. If the first slope turned out to be say negative one
9951160	9958360	third, the reciprocal of one third is three over one or just three. And the opposite means I change
9958360	9966520	it from a negative to a positive. So my perpendicular slope would be would be three. One more example,
9966520	9973080	if I started off with the slope of say seven halves, then the reciprocal of that would be
9973080	9979560	two sevenths, and I change it to an opposite reciprocal by changing the positive to a negative.
9980920	9983800	Let's use these two principles in some examples.
9985880	9990840	In our first example, we need to find the equation of a line that's parallel to this one,
9990840	9996760	and goes through the point negative three two. Well, in order to get started, I need to figure
9996760	10002920	out the slope of this line. So let me put this line into a more standard form the the slope intercept
10002920	10010200	form. So I'll start with three y minus four x plus six equals zero, I'm going to solve for y to put
10010200	10017400	it in this this more standard form. So I'll say three y equals four x minus six, and then divide
10017400	10024920	by three to get y equals four thirds x minus six thirds is divided all my terms by three, I can
10025480	10032600	simplify that a little bit y equals four thirds x minus two. Now I can read off the slope of my
10032600	10040440	original line. And one is four thirds. That means my slope of my new line, my parallel line will
10040440	10049960	also be four thirds. So my new line will have the equation y equals four thirds x plus b for some b,
10049960	10054760	of course, b will probably not be negative two, like it was for the first line, it'll be something
10054760	10060040	else determined by the fact that it goes through this point negative three two. To figure out what
10060040	10066920	b is, I'll plug in the point negative three two for negative three for x, and two for y. So that
10066920	10075400	gives me two equals four thirds times negative three plus b, and I'll solve for b. So let's see.
10075400	10083400	First, let me just simplify. So two equals, this is negative 12 thirds plus b, or in other words,
10083400	10090680	two is negative four plus b. So that means that b is going to be six. And my my parallel line will
10090680	10099560	have the equation y equals four thirds x plus six. Next, let's find the equation of a line
10099560	10105960	that's perpendicular to a given line through and go through a given point. Again, in order to get
10105960	10111240	started, I need to find what the slope of this given line is. So I'll rewrite it. Well, first
10111240	10118920	I'll just copy it over six x plus three y equals four. And then I can put it in the standard slope
10118920	10125960	intercept form by solving for y. So three y is negative six x plus four, divide everything by
10125960	10135320	three, I get y equals negative six thirds x plus four thirds. So y is negative two x plus four thirds.
10135320	10141560	So on my original slope of my original line is negative two, which means my perpendicular slope
10141560	10146840	is the opposite reciprocal. So I take the reciprocal of negative two, that's negative
10146840	10152600	one half and I change the sign. So that gives me one half as the slope of my perpendicular line.
10153320	10162360	Now my new line, I know it's going to be y equals one half x plus b for some b. And I can plug in
10162360	10172600	my point on my new line. So one for y and four for x and solve for b. So I get one equals two
10172600	10179880	plus b. So b is negative one. And so my new line has equation one half x minus one.
10182600	10186760	These next two examples are a little bit different, because now we're looking at
10186760	10196280	a line parallel to a completely horizontal line. Let me draw this line y equals three. So the y
10196360	10202920	coordinate is always three, which means that my line will be a horizontal line through that height
10202920	10209960	at height y equals three. If I want something parallel to this line, it will also be a horizontal
10209960	10216120	line. Since it goes through the point negative two one, let's see negative two one, it has to go
10216120	10223480	through that point there. It's going to have always have a y coordinate of one, the same as
10223480	10228600	the y coordinate of the point it goes through. So my answer will just be y equals one.
10230600	10237800	In the next example, we want a line that's perpendicular to the line y equals four, another
10239080	10246040	horizontal line y equals four. But perpendicular means I'm going to need a vertical line. So I need
10246040	10256440	a vertical line that goes through the point three, four. Okay. And so I'm going to draw a vertical
10256440	10264760	line there. Now vertical lines have the form x equals something for their equation. And to find
10264760	10269000	what x equals, I just need to look at the x coordinate of the point I'm going through,
10269080	10276280	this point three, four. So that x coordinate is three. And all the points on this, this perpendicular
10276280	10281160	and vertical line have x coordinate three. So my answer is x equals three.
10287160	10292040	In this video, we use the fact that parallel lines have the same slope. And perpendicular lines
10292040	10297320	have opposite reciprocal slopes to find the equations of parallel and perpendicular lines.
10299000	10302680	This video introduces functions and their domains and ranges.
10304120	10310120	A function is a correspondence between input numbers, usually the x values,
10310120	10316760	and output numbers, usually the y values, that sends each input number to exactly one output
10316760	10324600	number. Sometimes a function is thought of as a rule or machine in which you can feed in
10325160	10333560	x values as input and get out y values as output. So a non-mathematical example of a function might
10333560	10341320	be the biological mother function, which takes as input any person and gives as output their
10341320	10349400	biological mother. This function satisfies the condition that each input number object person
10349400	10356760	in this case gets sent to exactly one output person because if you take any person, they just
10356760	10363320	have one biological mother. So that rule does give you a function. But if I change things around
10363960	10371720	and just use the mother function, which sends to each person their mother, that's no longer going
10371720	10375960	to be a function because there are some people who have more than one mother, right? They could have
10375960	10381720	a biological mother and adopted mother or a mother and a stepmother or any number of situations.
10381720	10387080	So since there's at least some people who you would put it as input and then you'd
10387080	10393000	get like more than one possible output, that violates this rule of functions. It would not be
10393000	10398200	a function. Now most of the time we'll work with functions that are described with equations, not
10398200	10403480	in terms of mothers. So for example we could have the function y equals x squared plus one.
10403640	10410200	This can also be written as f of x equals x squared plus one. Here f of x is function notation
10410200	10418120	that stands for the output value of y. Notice that this notation is not representing multiplication.
10418120	10424920	We're not multiplying f by x. Instead, we're going to be putting in a value for x as input
10424920	10432120	and getting out a value of f of x or y. For example, if we want to evaluate f of two,
10432600	10439800	we're plugging in two as input for x either in this equation or in that equation. Since
10441000	10450520	f of two means two squared plus one, f of two is going to equal five. Similarly f of five means I
10450520	10459560	plug in five for x. So that's going to be five squared plus one or 26. Sometimes it's useful
10459560	10464680	to evaluate a function on a more complicated expression involving other variables. In this
10464680	10470200	case, remember the functions value on any expression is just what you get when you
10470200	10479480	plug in that whole expression for x. So f of a plus three is going to be the quantity a plus
10479480	10489080	three squared plus one. We could rewrite that as a squared plus six a plus nine plus one,
10489080	10496600	or a squared plus six a plus 10. When evaluating a function on a complex expression, it's important
10496600	10503480	to keep the parentheses when you plug in for x. That way, you evaluate the function on the whole
10503480	10514600	expression. For example, it would be wrong to write f of a plus three equals a plus three squared
10514600	10519800	plus one without the parentheses, because that would imply we were just squaring the three and
10519800	10527960	not the whole expression a plus three. Sometimes the function is described with a graph instead
10527960	10537080	of an equation. In this example, this graph is supposed to represent the function g of x. Not all
10537080	10542840	graphs actually represent functions. For example, the graph of a circle doesn't represent a function.
10543640	10549160	That's because the graph of a circle violates the vertical line test, you can draw a vertical line,
10549160	10555160	and I'll intersect the graph in more than one point. But our graph at left satisfies the vertical
10555160	10560680	line test. Any vertical line intersects the graph and at most one point. That means it's a function
10560680	10567800	because every x value will have at most one y value that corresponds to it. Let's evaluate
10567800	10575560	g of two. Note that two is an x value. And we'll use the graph to find the corresponding y value.
10576520	10583160	So I look for two on the x axis, and find the point on the graph that has that x value. That's
10583160	10591960	right here. Now I can look at the y value of that point looks like three, and therefore g of two is
10591960	10599400	equal to three. If I try to do the same thing to evaluate g of five, I run into trouble. Five is an
10599400	10606120	x value. I look for it on the x axis. But there's no point on the graph that has that x value.
10606520	10614120	Therefore, g of five is undefined, or we can say it does not exist. The question of what x values and
10614120	10621160	y values make sense for a function leads us to a discussion of domain and range. The domain of a
10621160	10627320	function is all possible x values that make sense for that function. The range is the y values that
10627320	10633560	make sense for the function. In this example, we saw that the x value of five didn't have a
10634360	10640760	corresponding y value for this function. So the x value of five is not in the domain of our function
10640760	10647880	g. To find the x values in the domain, we have to look at the x values that correspond to points on
10647880	10655880	the graph. When we do that is to take the shadow or projection of the graph onto the x axis, and see
10655880	10665080	what x values are hit. It looks like we're hitting all x values starting at negative eight and continuing
10665080	10674120	up to four. So our domain is the x's between negative eight and four, including those end points,
10674120	10679400	or we can write this in interval notation as negative eight comma four with square brackets.
10680600	10685640	To find the range of the function, we look for the y values corresponding to points on this graph.
10686280	10693080	We can do that by taking the shadow or projection of the graph onto the y axis.
10696360	10703160	We seem to be hitting all y values from negative five up through three.
10704760	10714040	So our range is wise between negative five and three or an interval notation negative five three
10714040	10719720	with square brackets. If we meet a function that's described as an equation instead of a graph,
10720520	10726280	one way to find the domain and range are to graph the function. But it's often possible to find the
10726280	10732280	domain at least more quickly by using algebraic considerations. We think about what x values
10732280	10737480	it makes sense to plug into this expression, and what x values need to be excluded because they
10737480	10743320	make the algebraic expression impossible to evaluate. Specifically, to find the domain of a function,
10744280	10751960	we need to exclude x values that make the denominator zero since we can't divide by zero.
10753160	10760760	We also need to exclude x values that make an expression inside a square root sign negative
10760760	10765800	since we can't take the square root of a negative number. In fact, we need to exclude values that
10765800	10772200	make expression inside any even root negative because we can't take an even root of a negative
10772200	10777480	number even though we can take an odd root like a cube root of a negative number. Later,
10777480	10782040	when we look at logarithmic functions, we'll have some additional exclusions that we have to make.
10782040	10787880	But for now, these two principles should handle all functions we'll see. So let's apply them to
10787880	10794760	a couple examples. For the function in part a, we don't have any square root signs, but we do have
10794760	10801000	a denominator. So we need to exclude x values that make the denominator zero. In other words,
10801000	10810760	we need x squared minus 4x plus three to not be equal to zero. If we solve x squared minus 4x plus
10810760	10819000	three equal to zero, we can do that by factoring. And that gives us x equals three or x equals one.
10819000	10825960	So we need to exclude these values. All other x values should be fine. So if I draw the number line,
10825960	10833480	I can put on one and three and just dig out a hole at both of those. And my domain includes
10833480	10839720	everything else on the number line. In interval notation, this means my domain is everything
10839720	10845960	from negative infinity to one together with everything from one to three together with
10845960	10852040	everything from three to infinity. In this second example, we don't have any
10852040	10859240	denominators to worry about, but we do have a square root sign. So we need to exclude any x values
10859240	10867320	that make three minus 2x less than zero. In other words, we can include all x values for which three
10867320	10873640	minus 2x is greater than or equal to zero. Solving that inequality gives us three is greater than
10873640	10882600	or equal to 2x. In other words, x is less than or equal to three halves. I can draw this on the
10882600	10891080	number line or write it in interval notation. Notice that three halves is included. And that's
10891080	10897400	because three minus 2x is allowed to be zero, I can take the square root of zero, it's just zero.
10897400	10902840	And that's not a problem. Finally, let's look at a more complicated function that involves
10902840	10907080	both a square root and a denominator. Now there are two things I need to worry about.
10908440	10917240	I need the denominator to not be equal to zero. And I need the stuff inside the square root sign
10917240	10922760	to be greater than or equal to zero. From our earlier work, we know that the first condition
10922760	10929160	means that x is not equal to three, and x is not equal to one. And the second condition
10929160	10934920	means that x is less than or equal to three halves. Let's draw both of those conditions
10934920	10942600	on the number line. x is not equal to three and x is not equal to one means we've got everything
10943640	10949880	except those two dug out points. And the other condition x is less than or equal to three halves
10949880	10956600	means we can have three halves and everything to the left of it. Now to be in our domain and to
10956600	10961080	be legit for our function, we need both of these conditions to be true. So I'm going to connect
10961080	10966200	these conditions with an and. And that means we're looking for numbers on the number line that are
10966200	10973240	colored both red and blue. So I'll draw that above in purple. So that's everything from three halves
10973240	10978520	to one. I have to dig out one because one was a problem for the denominator. And then I can
10978520	10984840	continue for all the things that are colored both both colors red and blue. So my final domain
10984840	10991560	is going to be let's see negative infinity up to but not including one together with
10992440	10998040	one but not including it to three halves and I include three halves since that was colored
10998040	11004040	both red and blue also. In this video, we talked about functions, how to evaluate them, and how
11004040	11010520	to find domains and ranges. This video gives the graphs of some commonly used functions that I call
11010520	11017400	the toolkit functions. The first function is the function y equals x. Let's plot a few points on
11017400	11027480	the graph of this function. If x is zero, y is zero. If x is one, y is one. And so on y is always
11027480	11033400	equal to x doesn't have to just be an integer, it can be any real number. And while connecting the
11033400	11040040	dots, we get a straight line through the origin. Let's look at the graph of y equals x squared.
11040680	11047400	If x is zero, y is zero. So we go through the origin again. If x is one, y is one.
11048520	11057080	And if x is negative one, y is also one. The x value of two gives a y value of four and the x
11057080	11063720	value of negative two gives a y value of four also. Connecting the dots, we get a parabola.
11064520	11074120	Notice that this function is an even function. That means it has mirror symmetry across the y
11074120	11080360	axis, the left side looks like exactly like the mirror image of the right side. That happens because
11080360	11085880	when you square a positive number like two, you get the exact same y value as when you
11086600	11094760	square its mirror image x value of negative two. The next function y equals x cubed. I'll call that
11094760	11102760	a cubic. Let's plot a few points when x is zero, y is zero. When x is one, y is one. When x is
11102760	11110360	negative one, y is negative one. Two goes with the point eight way up here and an x value of negative
11110360	11116440	two is going to give us negative eight. If I connect the dots, I get something that looks kind of like
11116440	11126360	this. This function is what's called an odd function, because it has 180 degree rotational
11126360	11131960	symmetry around the origin. If I rotate this whole graph by 180 degrees, or in other words,
11131960	11138840	turn the paper upside down, I'll get exactly the same shape. The reason this function has this odd
11138840	11146840	symmetry is because when I cube a positive number and get its y value, I get and cube the
11146840	11152520	corresponding negative number to get its y value, the negative number cubed gives us exactly the
11152520	11160200	negative of the y value we get with cubing the positive number. Let's look at the next example,
11160200	11169480	y equals a square root of x. Notice that the domain of this function is just x values bigger
11169480	11174280	than or equal to zero because we can't take the square root of a negative number. Let's plug in
11174280	11181960	a few x values, x is zero gives y is zero, x is one, square root of one is one, square root of four is
11181960	11186280	two. And connecting the dots, I get a function that looks like this.
11188760	11193240	The absolute value function is next. Again, if we plug in a few points,
11194440	11201960	x is zero goes with y equals zero, x is one gives us one, the absolute value of negative one is one.
11203640	11209800	Two two is on the graph and the absolute value of negative two is two. I'm ending up getting
11210520	11215880	a v shaped graph. It also has even or mirror symmetry.
11217800	11224280	Y equals two to the x is what's known as an exponential function. That's because the variable x
11224280	11237240	is in the exponent. If I plot a few points, two to the zero is one, two to the one is two,
11237240	11243960	two squared is four, two to the minus one is one half. I'll plot these on my graph.
11244760	11251240	Let me fill in a few more points. So let's see, two cubed is eight, that's way up here.
11251880	11258200	And negative two gives me one fourth, one eighth. Connecting the dots, I get something that's shaped
11258200	11264760	like this. You might have heard the expression exponential growth when talking about, for example,
11264760	11272360	population growth. This is function is represents exponential growth. It grows very, very steeply.
11272360	11277640	Every time we increase the x coordinate by one, we double the y coordinate.
11280040	11286600	We could also look at a function like y equals three to the x or sometimes y equals e to the x,
11286600	11293560	where e is just a number about 2.7. These functions look very similar. It's just the
11293560	11301800	bigger base makes us rise a little more steeply. Now let's look at the function y equals one over x.
11302760	11309640	It's not defined when x is zero. But I can plug in x equals one half, one over one half is two.
11311480	11319400	One over one is one. And one over two is one half. If I connect the dots, I get this shape
11319960	11325240	in the first quadrant, but I haven't looked at negative values of x. When x is negative, one over
11325240	11332680	negative one is negative one. One over negative a half is negative two. And I get a similar looking
11332680	11343640	piece in the third quadrant. This is an example of a hyperbola. And it's also an odd function,
11343640	11349560	because it has that 180 degree rotational symmetry. If I turn the page upside down,
11349560	11355000	it'll look exactly the same. Finally, let's look at y equals one over x squared.
11356200	11359960	Again, it's not defined when x is zero, but I can plug in points like
11360840	11367880	one half for x. Let's see one over one half squared is one over one fourth, which is four.
11368520	11376120	And one over one squared, one over two squared is a fourth. It looks pretty much like the previous
11376120	11381080	function. It's just a little bit more extreme rises a little more steeply, falls a little more
11381080	11386120	dramatically. But for negative values of x, something a little bit different goes on. For
11386120	11393400	example, one over negative two squared is just one over four, which is a fourth. So I can plot
11393400	11401720	so I can plot that point there. And one over negative one squared, that's just one. So my
11401720	11406680	curve for negative values of x is going to lie in the second quadrant, not the third quadrant.
11407400	11415560	This is an example of an even function, because it has perfect mirror symmetry across the y axis.
11416920	11421800	These are the toolkit functions. And I recommend you memorize the shape of each of them.
11422520	11428280	That way you can draw at least a rough sketch very quickly without having to plug in points.
11429400	11431960	That's all for the graphs of the toolkit functions.
11434200	11440440	If we change the equation of a function, then the graph of the function changes or transforms
11440440	11446520	in predictable ways. This video gives some rules and examples for transformations of functions.
11447160	11451400	To get the most out of this video, it's helpful if you're already familiar with the graph of
11451400	11457000	some typical functions, I call them toolkit functions, like y equals square root of x,
11457000	11463000	y equals x squared, y equals the absolute value of x, and so on. If you're not familiar with those
11463000	11468840	graphs, I encourage you to watch my video called toolkit functions first before watching this one.
11470200	11476440	I want to start by reviewing function notation. If g of x represents the function the square root of
11476440	11484360	x, then we can rewrite these expressions in terms of square roots. For example, g of x minus two
11484920	11488040	is the same thing as the square root of x minus two.
11490280	11498120	g of quantity x minus two means we plug in x minus two everywhere we see an x.
11498840	11504120	So that would be the same thing as the square root of quantity x minus two.
11504120	11510280	In this second example, I say that we're subtracting two on the inside of the function,
11510280	11515320	because we're subtracting two before we apply the square root function. Whereas on the first
11515320	11520520	example, I say that the minus two is on the outside of the function. We're doing the square root
11520520	11526760	function first and then subtracting two. In this third example, g of three x, we're multiplying
11526760	11532840	by three on the inside of the function. To evaluate this in terms of square root, we plug in the entire
11532840	11538760	three x for x and the square root function. That gives us the square root of three x.
11540120	11543720	In the next example, we're multiplying by three on the outside of the function.
11544760	11552280	This is just three times the square root of x. Finally, g of minus x means the square root of
11552280	11557320	minus x. This might look a little odd because we're not used to taking the square root of a
11557320	11563320	negative number. But remember that if x itself is negative, like negative two, then negative x will
11563320	11567960	be negative negative two or positive two. So we'll really be taking the square root of a positive
11567960	11573480	number in that case. Let me record which of these are inside and which of these are outside of my
11573480	11579640	function. In this next set of examples, we're using the same function g of x is square root of x.
11579640	11583800	But this time we're starting with an expression with square roots in it and trying to write it
11583800	11591000	in terms of g of x. So the first example, the plus 17 is on the outside of my function,
11591000	11598120	because I'm taking the square root of x first and then adding 17. So I can write this as g of x
11598120	11606920	plus 17. In the second example, I'm taking x and adding 12 first, then I take the square root of the
11606920	11612280	whole thing. Since I'm adding the 12 to x first, that's on the inside of my function. So I write
11612280	11620840	that as g of the quantity x plus 12. Remember that this notation means I plug in the entire x plus
11620840	11627000	12 into the square root sign, which gives me exactly square root of x plus 12. In this next
11627000	11632920	example, I'm doing the square root first and then multiplying by negative 36. So my minus 36
11632920	11640600	multiplication is outside my function. I can rewrite this as minus 36 times g of x. Finally,
11640600	11646120	in this last example, I take x multiply by a fourth and then apply the square root of x.
11646120	11653000	So that's the same thing as g of one fourth x, my one fourth x is on the inside of my function.
11653560	11657320	In other words, it's inside the parentheses when I use function notation.
11659160	11662920	Let's graph the square root of x and two transformations of this function.
11662920	11669160	y equals the square root of x goes through the points zero zero one one and four two,
11669160	11672600	since the square root of four is two, and looks something like this.
11674520	11680120	In order to graph y equals the square root of x minus two, notice that the minus two is on the
11680120	11684920	outside of the function. That means we're going to take the square root of x first and then subtract
11684920	11691400	two. So for example, if we start with the x value of zero and compute the square root of zero, that's
11692200	11695720	then we subtract two to give us a y value of negative two.
11696920	11703560	An x value of one, which under the square root function had a y value of one, now has a y value
11703560	11711640	that's decreased by two, one minus two is negative one. And finally, an x value of four, which under
11711640	11718040	the square root function had a y value of two, now has a y value of two minus two or zero. Its y
11718040	11725960	value was also decreased by two. If I plot these new points, zero goes with negative two, one goes
11725960	11734600	with negative one, and four goes with zero, I have my transformed graph. Because I subtracted two on
11734600	11741720	the outside of my function, my y values were decreased by two, which brought my graph down by two units.
11742680	11749080	Next, let's look at y equals the square root of quantity x minus two. Now we're subtracting two on
11749080	11753320	the inside of our function, which means we subtract two from x first and then take the square root.
11753960	11760840	In order to get the same y value of zero as we had in our blue graph, we need our x minus two to be
11760840	11767800	zero. So we need our original x to be two. In order to get the y value of one that we had in our blue
11768040	11774520	graph, we need to be taking the square root of one. So we need x minus two to be one, which means
11774520	11781240	that we need to start with an x value of three. And in order to reproduce our y value of two from
11781240	11787800	our original graph, we need the square root of x minus two to be two, which means we need to start
11787800	11795000	out by taking the square root of four, which means our x minus two is four. So our x should be up
11795000	11803080	there at six. If I plot my x values with my corresponding y values of square root of x minus
11803080	11810360	two, I get the following graph. Notice that the graph has moved horizontally to the right by two
11810360	11818360	units. To me, moving down by two units makes sense because we're subtracting two. So we're
11818360	11823960	decreasing y's by two units. But the minus two on the inside, that kind of does the opposite of what
11823960	11829640	I expect. I might expect it to move the graph left. I might expect the x values to be going
11829640	11836680	down by two units. But instead, it moves the graph to the right. Because the x units have to go up by
11836680	11841880	two units in order to get the right square root when I then subtract two units again.
11842680	11845640	The observations we made for these transformations of functions
11846360	11853080	hold in general, according to the following rules. First of all, numbers on the outside of the function,
11853080	11859560	like in our example, y equals the square root of x minus two. Those numbers affect the y values
11859560	11865560	and result in vertical motions, like we saw. These motions are in the direction you expect. So
11865560	11871720	subtracting two moves just down by two. If we were adding two instead, that would move us up by two.
11873000	11878440	Numbers on the inside of the function, that's like our example, y equals the square root of
11878440	11884040	quantity x minus two, those affect the x values and results in a horizontal motion.
11884600	11889720	These motions go in the opposite direction from what you expect. Remember, the minus two on the
11889720	11895640	inside actually shifted our graph to the right. If it had had a plus two on the inside, that would
11895640	11903080	actually shift our graph to the left. Adding results in a shift, those are called translations,
11903080	11909880	but multiplying, like something like y equals three times the square root of x, that would result
11909880	11915560	in a stretch or shrink. In other words, if I start with the square root of x,
11917000	11922040	and then want to graph y equals three times the square root of x, that stretches my graph
11922040	11930680	vertically by a factor of three, like this. If I want to graph y equals one third times the
11930680	11938600	square root of x, that shrinks my graph vertically by a factor of one third. Finally, a negative sign
11938600	11944120	results in reflection. For example, if I start with a graph of y equals a square root of x,
11945240	11951240	and then want to graph y equals the square root of negative x, that's going to do a reflection
11951240	11955080	in the horizontal direction because the negative is on the inside of the square root sign.
11955080	11960760	A reflection in the horizontal direction means a reflection across the y axis.
11962520	11967960	If instead I want to graph y equals negative the square root of x, that negative sign on the outside
11967960	11976680	means a vertical reflection, a reflection across the x axis. Pause the video for a moment and see
11976680	11982520	if you can describe what happens in these four transformations. In the first example, we're
11982520	11988200	subtracting four on the outside of the function. Adding and subtracting means a translation or
11988200	11993480	shift, and since we're on the outside of the function, it affects the y values, that's moving
11993480	12000840	us vertically. So this transformation should take the square root of graph and move it down
12000840	12009240	by four units. That would look something like this. In the next example, we're adding 12 on the
12009240	12015560	inside. That's still a translation, but now we're moving horizontally. And so since we go
12015560	12021640	the opposite direction we expect, we are going to go to the left by 12 units. That's going to look
12021640	12027880	something like this. In the next example, we're multiplying by three and introducing a negative
12027880	12033960	sign, both on the outside of our function. Outside our function means we're affecting the y values.
12033960	12040920	So and multiplication means we're stretching by a factor of three. The negative sign means we reflect
12040920	12047080	in the vertical direction. Here's stretching by a factor of three vertically before I apply the
12047080	12054760	minus sign. And now the minus sign reflects in the vertical direction. Finally, in this last
12054760	12060600	example, we're multiplying by one quarter on the inside of our function. We know that multiplication
12060600	12067160	means stretch or shrink. And since we're on the inside, it's a horizontal motion. And it does the
12067160	12072680	opposite of what we expect. So instead of shrinking by a factor of one fourth horizontally, it's
12072680	12079240	actually going to stretch by the reciprocal, a factor of four horizontally. That'll look something
12079240	12085800	like this. Notice that stretching horizontally by a factor of four looks kind of like shrinking
12085800	12091960	vertically by a factor of one half. And that's actually borne out by the algebra, because the
12091960	12096840	square root of one fourth x is the same thing as the square root of one fourth times the square root
12096840	12104280	of x, which is the same thing as one half times the square root of x. And so now we can see algebraically
12104280	12110920	that a vertical shrink by a factor of one half is the same as a horizontal stretch by a factor of
12110920	12117080	four, at least for this function, the square root function. This video gave some rules for
12117080	12125080	transformations of functions, which I'll repeat below. Numbers on the outside correspond to changes
12125080	12133720	in the y values, or vertical motions. Numbers on the inside of the function affect the x values
12134280	12143160	and result in horizontal motions. Adding and subtracting corresponds to translations or shifts.
12144840	12152440	Multiplying and dividing by numbers corresponds to stretches and shrinks. And putting in a negative
12152440	12161880	sign corresponds to a reflection. A horizontal reflection, if the negative sign is on the inside
12161880	12167720	and a vertical reflection, if the negative sign is on the outside. Knowing these basic rules about
12167720	12172840	transformations empowers you to be able to sketch graphs of much more complicated functions,
12173880	12179320	like y equals three times the square root of x plus two, by simply considering the transformations
12180440	12187720	one at a time. A quadratic function is a function that can be written in the form f of x equals
12187800	12198920	ax squared plus bx plus c, where a, b, and c are real numbers. And a is not equal to zero.
12199640	12206200	The reason we require that a is not equal to zero is because if a were equal to zero,
12206200	12212520	we'd have f of x is equal to bx plus c, which is called a linear function.
12213480	12218600	So by making sure that a is not zero, we make sure there's really an x squared term,
12218600	12224440	which is the hallmark of a quadratic function. Please pause the video for a moment and decide
12224440	12231000	which of these equations represent quadratic functions. The first function can definitely
12231000	12239320	be written in the form g of x equals ax squared plus bx plus c, in fact it's already written in
12239320	12248360	that form, where a is negative five, b is 10, and c is three. The second equation is also a
12248360	12256760	quadratic function, because we can think of it as f of x equals one times x squared plus zero times
12256760	12267240	x plus zero. So it is in the right form, where a is one, b is zero, and c is zero. It's perfectly
12267240	12273400	fine for the coefficient of x and the constant term to be zero for a quadratic function. We
12273400	12277880	just need the coefficient of x squared to be nonzero, so the x squared term is preserved.
12279480	12286680	The third equation is not a quadratic function. It's a linear function, because there's no x
12286680	12295240	squared term. The fourth function might not look like a quadratic function, but if we rewrite it
12295240	12302280	by expanding out the x minus three squared, let's see what happens. We get y equals two times x
12302280	12310840	minus three times x minus three plus four. So that's two times x squared minus three x minus three x
12310840	12323160	plus nine plus four. Continuing, I get two x squared minus 12 x's plus 18 plus four. In other
12323160	12331000	words, y equals two x squared minus 12 x plus 22. So in fact, our function can be written in the right
12331000	12339240	form, and it is a quadratic function. A function that is already written in the form y equals a x
12339240	12349080	squared plus b x plus c is said to be in standard form. So our first example g of x is in standard
12349080	12357240	form. A function that's written in the format of the last function, that is, in the form of y equals
12357240	12367880	a times x minus h squared plus k for some numbers a, h, and k, that's said to be in vertex form.
12369000	12373080	I'll talk more about standard form and vertex form in another video.
12373640	12378920	In this video, we identified some quadratic functions and talked about the difference between
12378920	12391080	standard form and vertex form. This video is about graphing quadratic functions. A quadratic function,
12391080	12400120	which is typically written in standard form, like this, or sometimes in vertex form, like this, always
12400680	12407320	has the graph that looks like a parabola. This video will show how to tell whether the parabola is
12407320	12418280	pointing up or down, how to find its x-intercepts, and how to find its vertex. The bare bones basic
12418280	12426600	quadratic function is f of x equals x squared. It goes to the origin since f of zero is zero
12426600	12435960	squared, which is zero, and it is a parabola pointing upwards like this. The vertex of a parabola
12435960	12441480	is its lowest point if it's pointing upwards, and its highest point if it's pointing downwards.
12442520	12449800	So in this case, the vertex is at zero zero. The x-intercepts are where the graph crosses the
12449880	12457000	x-axis, in other words, where y is zero. And in this function, y equals zero means that x squared is
12457000	12463800	zero, which happens only when x is zero. So the x-intercept, there's only one of them, is also zero.
12465000	12470200	This second function, y equals negative three x squared, also goes through the origin,
12470840	12478120	since the function's value when x is zero is y equals zero. But in this case, the parabola is
12478120	12484840	pointing downwards. That's because thinking about transformations of functions, a negative sign on
12484840	12491800	the outside reflects the function vertically over the x-axis, making the parabola instead of pointing
12491800	12500040	upwards, reflecting the point downwards. The number three on the outside stretches the graph
12500040	12505560	vertically by a factor of three, so it makes it kind of long and skinny, like this.
12508520	12513720	In general, a negative coefficient to the x squared term means the parabola will be pointing
12513720	12519080	down, whereas a positive coefficient, like here the coefficient's one, means the parabola's pointing
12519080	12527640	up. I'll write that rule over here. So if a is bigger than zero, the parabola opens up,
12529160	12534120	and if the value of the coefficient a is less than zero, then the parabola opens down.
12534120	12541320	In this second example, we can see again that the vertex is at zero zero, and the x intercept is x
12541320	12549480	equals zero. Let's look at this third example. If we multiplied our expression out, we'd see
12549480	12555320	that the coefficient of x squared would be two, a positive number. So that means our parabola is
12555320	12562360	going to be opening up. But the vertex of this parabola will no longer be at the origin. In fact,
12562360	12566920	we can find the parabola's vertex by thinking about transformations of functions.
12568440	12576600	Our function is related to the function y equals two x squared by moving it to the right by three
12576600	12587480	and up by four. Since y equals two x squared has a vertex at zero zero, if we move that whole
12587480	12596920	parabola, including the vertex right by three, and up by four, the vertex will end up at the point
12596920	12607080	three, four. So a parabola will look something like this. Notice how easy it was to just read
12607080	12613720	off the vertex when our quadratic function is written in this form. In fact, any parabola,
12613720	12620520	any quadratic function written in the form a times x minus h squared plus k has a vertex
12621240	12628520	at hk. By the same reasoning, we're moving the parabola with a vertex at the origin
12628520	12636440	to the right by h and up by k. That's why this form of a quadratic function is called the vertex
12636440	12644680	form. Notice that this parabola has no x intercepts because it does not cross the x axis.
12645960	12650840	For our final function, we have g of x equals five x squared plus 10x plus three.
12652280	12656920	We know the graph of this function will be a parabola pointing upwards because the coefficient
12656920	12665480	of x squared is positive. To find the x intercepts, we can set y equals zero. Since the x intercepts
12665480	12673400	is where our graph crosses the x axis, and that's where the y value is zero. So zero equals five x
12673400	12679080	squared plus 10x plus three, I'm going to use the quadratic formula to solve that. So x is
12679080	12686840	negative 10 plus or minus the square root of 10 squared minus four times five times three,
12686840	12693880	all over two times five. That simplifies to x equals negative 10 plus or minus the square root
12693880	12702120	of 40 over 10, which simplifies further to x equals negative 10 over 10 plus or minus the
12702120	12709400	square root of 40 over 10, which is negative one plus or minus two square root of 10 over 10,
12709400	12716040	or negative one plus or minus square root of 10 over five. Since the square root of 10 is just a
12716040	12723800	little bit bigger than three, this works out to approximately about negative two-fifths and
12723800	12730120	negative eight-fifths. So somewhere around right here. So our parabola is going to look something
12730120	12737480	like this. Notice that it goes through, crosses the x axis at y equals three. That's because when
12737480	12745960	we plug in x equals zero into here, we get y equals three. So the y intercept is at three.
12746760	12755800	Finally, we can find the vertex. Since this function is written in standard form, the y equals
12755800	12764760	ax plus x squared plus bx plus c form, and not in vertex form, we can't just read off the vertex
12764760	12770200	like we could before. But there's a trick called the vertex formula, which says that whenever you
12770200	12777480	have a function in a quadratic function in standard form, the vertex has an x coordinate
12779000	12788440	of negative b over 2a. So in this case, that's an x coordinate of negative 10 over two times five
12788440	12794040	or negative one, which is kind of like where I put it on the graph. To find the y coordinate
12794040	12803800	of that vertex, I can just plug in negative one into my equation for x, which gives me y equals
12803800	12811320	five times negative one squared plus 10 times negative one plus three, which is negative two.
12812600	12817000	So I think I better redraw my graph a little bit to put that vertex down at
12817000	12819720	a y coordinate of negative two, where it's supposed to be.
12823960	12828920	Let's summarize the steps we use to graph these quadratic functions. First of all,
12828920	12832520	the graph of a quadratic function has the shape of a parabola.
12835480	12841480	The parabola opens up if the coefficient of x squared, which we call a is greater than zero,
12841480	12849000	and down if a is less than zero. To find the x intercepts, we set y equal to zero,
12849000	12858600	or in other words, f of x equal to zero, and solve for x. To find the vertex, we can either read it
12858600	12869560	off as hk if our function is in vertex form, or we can use the vertex formula
12871480	12881400	and get the x coordinate of the vertex to be negative b over two a, if our function is in
12881400	12890920	standard form. To find the y coordinate of the vertex in this case, we just plug in the x coordinate
12892600	12899560	and figure out what y is. Finally, we can always find additional points on the graph by plugging in
12900200	12907080	values of x. In this video, we learned some tricks for graphing quadratic functions.
12908040	12915960	In particular, we saw that the vertex can be read off as hk if our function is written
12915960	12920920	in vertex form, and the x coordinate of the vertex can be calculated
12923480	12930920	as negative b over two a if our function is in standard form. For an explanation of why this
12930920	12938840	vertex formula works, please see it in my other video. A quadratic in standard form looks like
12938840	12946280	y equals ax squared plus bx plus c, where a, b, and c are real numbers, and a is not zero.
12947320	12954840	A quadratic function in vertex form looks like y equals a times x minus h squared plus k,
12954840	12961000	where a, h, and k are real numbers, and a is not zero. When a function is in vertex form,
12961000	12969080	it's easy to read off the vertex. It's just the ordered pair hk. This video explains how to get
12969080	12976520	from vertex form to standard form and vice versa. Let's start by converting this quadratic function
12976520	12982680	from vertex form to standard form. That's pretty straightforward. We just have to distribute out.
12984840	12989480	So if I multiply out the x minus three squared,
12991880	13001000	I get minus four times x squared minus six x plus nine plus one, distributing the negative four,
13001000	13010360	I get negative four x squared plus 24x minus 36 plus one. So that works out to minus four x squared
13010360	13018280	plus 24x minus 35. And I have my quadratic function now in standard form.
13019880	13025240	Now let's go the other direction and convert a quadratic function that's already in standard form
13025800	13036040	into vertex form. That is, we want to put it in the form of g of x equals a times x minus h squared
13036040	13045400	plus k, where the vertex is at hk. To do this, it's handy to use the vertex formula.
13047000	13054680	The vertex formula says that the x coordinate of the vertex is given by negative b over two a,
13055320	13063160	where a is the coefficient of x squared, and b is the coefficient of x. So in this case,
13063160	13068840	we get an x coordinate of negative eight over two times two or negative two.
13069800	13077880	To find the y coordinate of the vertex, we just plug in the x coordinate into our formula for g
13077880	13085240	of x. So that's g of negative two, which is two times negative two squared plus eight times negative
13085240	13093560	two plus six. And that works out to be negative two by coincidence. So the vertex for our quadratic
13093560	13099960	function has coordinates negative two, negative two. And if I want to write g of x in vertex form,
13099960	13108440	it's going to be a times x minus negative two squared plus minus two. That's because
13109240	13118600	remember, we subtract h and we add k. So that simplifies to g of x equals a times x plus two
13118600	13124520	squared minus two. And finally, we just need to figure out what this leading coefficient a is.
13125080	13132840	But notice if we were to multiply distribute this out, then the coefficient of x squared would end
13132920	13139080	up being a. So therefore, the coefficient of x squared here, which is a has to be the same as
13139080	13144440	the coefficient of x squared here, which we conveniently also call a. In other words, our a down
13144440	13151560	here needs to be two. So I'm going to write that as g of x equals two times x plus two squared
13151560	13158920	minus two, lots of twos in this problem. And that's our quadratic function in vertex form.
13158920	13162840	If I want to check my answer, of course, I could just distribute out again, I'd get
13164200	13174200	two times x squared plus four x plus two minus two. In other words, two x squared plus eight x
13174200	13180360	plus six, which checks out to exactly what I started with. This video showed how to get from
13180360	13186920	vertex form to standard form by distributing out and how to get from standard form to vertex form
13187000	13189720	by finding the vertex using the vertex formula.
13191880	13198520	Suppose you have a quadratic function in the form y equals a x squared plus b x plus c,
13199240	13202600	and you want to find where the vertex is when you graph it.
13204840	13214600	The vertex formula says that the x coordinate of this vertex is at negative b over two a.
13214920	13220040	This video gives a justification for where that formula comes from.
13221560	13227240	Let's start with a specific example. Suppose I wanted to find the x intercepts and the vertex
13227240	13234520	for this quadratic function. To find the x intercepts, I would set y equal to zero and solve
13234520	13241160	for x. So that's zero equals three x squared plus seven x minus five. And to solve for x,
13241160	13247160	I use the quadratic formula. So x is going to be negative seven plus or minus the square root of
13247160	13253800	seven squared minus four times three times negative five all over two times three.
13255400	13262040	That simplifies to negative seven plus or minus the square root of 109 over six.
13262040	13267560	We could I could also write this as negative seven six plus the square root of 109 over six,
13268200	13272920	or x equals negative seven six minus the square root of 109 over six.
13273560	13279560	Since the square root of 109 is just a little bit bigger than 10, this can be approximated
13279560	13286440	by negative seven six plus 10 six and negative seven six minus 10 six.
13287960	13294040	So pretty close to I guess about what a half over here and pretty close to about negative
13294040	13299560	three over here. I'm just going to estimate so that I can draw a picture of the function.
13300200	13305160	Since the leading coefficient three is positive, I know my parabola is going to be opening up
13305720	13313960	and the intercepts are somewhere around here and here. So roughly speaking, it's going to look
13313960	13323400	something like this. Now the vertex is going to be somewhere in between the two x intercepts. In fact,
13323400	13328600	it's going to be by symmetry, it'll be exactly halfway in between the two x intercepts.
13329160	13335880	Since the x intercepts are negative seven six plus and minus 100 square root of 109 over six,
13335880	13340440	the number halfway in between those is going to be exactly negative seven six.
13341800	13349720	Right, because on the one hand, I have negative seven six plus something. And on the other hand,
13349720	13356200	I have negative seven six minus that same thing. So negative seven six will be exactly
13356200	13364200	in the middle. So my x coordinate of my vertex will be at negative seven six.
13365160	13368920	Notice that I got that number from the quadratic formula.
13372040	13377000	More generally, if I want to find the x intercepts for any quadratic function,
13377000	13384920	I set y equal to zero and solve for x using the quadratic formula negative b plus or minus
13384920	13392920	the square root of b squared minus four ac all over two a the x intercepts will be at these two
13392920	13399560	values. But the x coordinate of the vertex, which is exactly halfway in between the two x intercepts
13400280	13405640	will be at negative b over two a. That's where the vertex formula comes from.
13406760	13411800	And it turns out that this formula works even when there are no x intercepts, even when the
13411800	13417560	the quadratic formula gives us no solutions, the vertex still has the x coordinate negative b over
13417560	13426760	two a. And that's the justification of the vertex formula. This video is about polynomials
13426760	13432440	and their graphs. Recall that a polynomial is a function like this one, for example,
13434200	13441960	whose terms are numbers times powers of x. I'll start with some definitions. The degree of a
13441960	13449400	polynomial is the largest exponent. For example, for this polynomial, the degree is four.
13449800	13456680	The leading term is the term with the largest exponent. In the same example, the leading term
13456680	13463800	is five x to the fourth. It's conventional to write the polynomial in descending order of powers
13463800	13469400	of x, so the leading term is first. But the leading term doesn't have to be the first term. If I
13469480	13478520	wrote the same polynomial as y equals, say, two minus 17 x minus 21 x cubed plus five x fourth,
13478520	13485240	the leading term would still be the five x to the fourth, even though it was last. The leading
13485240	13492440	coefficient is the number in the leading term. In this example, the leading coefficient is five.
13492840	13499000	Finally, the constant term is the term with no x's in it. In our same example, the constant term
13499000	13505560	is two. Please pause the video for a moment and take a look at this next example of polynomial.
13506120	13510760	Figure out what's the degree, the leading term, the leading coefficient, and the constant term.
13511960	13519000	The degree is again four, since that's the highest power we have. And the leading term
13519480	13526280	is negative seven x to the fourth. The leading coefficient is negative seven, and the constant
13526280	13535480	term is 18. In the graph of the polynomial shown here, the three marked points are called turning
13535480	13541400	points, because the polynomial turns around and changes direction at those three points.
13541880	13548200	Those same points can also be called local extreme points, or they can be called local
13548200	13555160	maximum and minimum points. For this polynomial, the degree is four, and the number of turning
13555160	13561320	points is three. Let's compare the degree and the number of turning points for these next three
13561320	13570280	examples. For the first one, the degree is two, and there's one, two, three, four, five, six,
13570520	13580840	and there's one turning point. For the sixth example, the degree is three, and there's two
13580840	13588200	turning points. And for this last example, the degree is four, and there's one turning point.
13589960	13595400	For this first example, and the next two, the number of turning points is exactly one less than
13595400	13602120	the degree. So you might conjecture that this is always true. But in fact, this is not always true.
13603000	13608760	In this last example, the degree is four, but the number of turning points is one, not three.
13609960	13614280	In fact, it turns out that while the number of turning points is not always equal to the
13614280	13621240	degree minus one, it is always less than or equal to the degree minus one. That's a useful fact to
13621240	13625400	remember when you're sketching graphs or recognizing graphs of polynomials.
13626760	13633400	The end behavior of a function is how the ends of the function look as x gets bigger and bigger
13633400	13639080	heads towards infinity, or x gets goes through larger and larger negative numbers towards negative
13639080	13647560	infinity. In this first example, the graph of the function goes down as x gets towards infinity,
13647560	13653640	and as x goes towards negative infinity, I can draw this with two little arrows pointing down on
13653640	13659960	either side, or I can say in words that the function is falling as we had left and falling
13659960	13667640	also as we had right. In the second example, the graph rises to the left and rises to the right.
13668760	13675240	In the third example, the graph falls to the left, but rises to the right. And in the fourth
13675240	13682520	example, it rises to the left and falls to the right. If you study these examples and others,
13682520	13689400	you might notice there's a relationship between the degree of the polynomial, the leading coefficients
13689400	13696120	of the polynomials, and the end behavior. Specifically, these four types of end behavior
13696120	13703400	are determined by whether the degree is even or odd, and by whether the leading coefficient
13703960	13711880	is positive or negative. When the degree is even, and the leading coefficient is positive,
13712520	13719320	like in this example where the leading coefficient is one, we have this sorts of end behavior rising
13719320	13725720	on both sides. When the degree is even and the leading coefficient is negative, like in this
13725720	13733320	example, we have the end behavior that's falling on both sides. When the degree is odd, and the
13733320	13738520	leading coefficient is positive, that's like this example, with a degree three and a leading
13738520	13746440	coefficient three, then we have this sort of end behavior. And finally, when the degree is odd,
13746440	13751880	and the leading coefficient is negative, like in this example, we have this sort of end behavior.
13752520	13759560	I like to remember this chart just by thinking of the most simple examples, y equals x squared,
13759560	13766200	y equals negative x squared, y equals x cubed, and y equals negative x cubed, because I know by
13766200	13775080	heart what those four examples look like. Then I just have to remember that any polynomial with a
13775080	13782760	any polynomial with an even degree and positive leading coefficient has the same end behavior
13782760	13790600	as x squared. And similarly, any polynomial with even degree and negative leading coefficient
13790600	13797080	has the same end behavior as negative x squared, and similar statements for x cubed and negative x
13797080	13803960	cubed. We can use facts about turning points and end behavior to say something about the equation
13803960	13811240	of a polynomial just by looking at its graph. In this example, because of the end behavior,
13811240	13817800	we know that the degree is odd. We know that the leading coefficient
13819720	13827800	must be positive. And finally, since there are one, two, three, four turning points,
13827800	13835480	we know that the degree is greater than or equal to five. That's because the number of
13835480	13841960	turning points is less than or equal to the degree minus one. And in this case, the number of turning
13841960	13849640	points we said was four. And so solving that inequality, we get the degree is bigger than
13849640	13856440	or equal to five. Putting some of that information together, we see that the degree could be
13858040	13864680	five or seven or nine, or any odd number greater than or equal to five. But it couldn't be, for
13864680	13873080	example, three or six, because even numbers and and also numbers less than five are right out.
13873080	13880600	This video gave a lot of definitions, including the definition of degree, leading coefficients,
13882200	13891720	turning points, and end behavior. We saw that knowing the degree and the leading coefficient
13891720	13895720	can help you make predictions about the number of turning points and the end behavior,
13896600	13902440	as well as vice versa. This video is about exponential functions and their graphs.
13904040	13910760	An exponential function is a function that can be written in the form f of x equals a times b to
13910760	13918200	the x, where a and b are any real numbers, as long as a is not zero, and b is positive.
13919480	13925480	It's important to notice that for an exponential function, the variable x is in the exponent.
13926120	13931320	This is different from many other functions we've seen. For example, a quadratic function
13931320	13937560	like f of x equals three x squared has the variable in the base. So it's not an exponential function.
13939480	13947160	For exponential functions, f of x equals a times b to the x, we require that a is not equal to zero,
13947160	13955080	because otherwise, we would have f of x equals zero times b to the x, which just means that f of x
13955080	13961400	equals zero. And this is called a constant function, not an exponential function. Because f of x is
13961400	13969480	always equal to zero. In an exponential function, we require that b is bigger than zero, because
13969480	13980840	otherwise, for example, if b is equal to negative one, say, we'd have f of x equals a times negative
13980840	13987480	one to the x. Now, this would make sense for a lot of values of x. But if we tried to do something
13987480	13995880	like f of one half with our b's negative one, that would be the same thing as a times the square root
13995880	14003080	of negative one, which is not a real number. We'd get the same problem for other values of b, if the
14003080	14011080	values of b were negative. And if we tried b equals zero, we'd get a kind of ridiculous thing a times
14011080	14017000	zero to the x, which again is always zero. So that wouldn't count as an exponential either. So we can't
14017000	14021400	use any negative bases, and we can't use zero bases if we want an exponential function.
14022760	14029880	The number a in the expression f of x equals a times b to the x is called the initial value.
14030280	14038360	And the number b is called the base. The phrase initial value comes to the fact that if we plug in
14038360	14045560	x equals zero, we get a times b to the zero, well, anything to the zero is just one. So this is equal
14045560	14055880	to a. In other words, f of zero equals a. So if we think of starting out, when x equals zero, we get
14055960	14062360	we get the y value of a. That's why it's called the initial value.
14067160	14072680	Let's start out with this example, where y equals a times b to the x, an exponential function,
14072680	14079800	and we've set a equal to one and b equals the two. Notice that the y intercept, the value when x is
14079800	14089560	zero is going to be one. If I change my a value, my initial value, the y intercept changes.
14090600	14099720	The function is stretched out. If I make the value of a go to zero and then negative,
14101080	14107080	then my initial value becomes negative and my graph flips across the x-axis.
14108040	14113960	Let's go back to an a value of say one and see what happens when we change b.
14115000	14125000	Right now, the b value, the base is two. If I increase b, my y intercept sticks at one,
14125000	14133080	but my graph becomes steeper and steeper. If I put b back down close to one, my graph becomes
14133800	14138520	more flat. At exactly one, my graph is just a constant.
14140520	14148600	As b gets into fractional territory, 0.8, 0.7, 0.6, my graph starts to slope the other way.
14148600	14154280	It's decreasing now instead of increasing, but notice that the y intercept still hasn't changed.
14155400	14160920	I can get it more and more steep as my b gets farther and farther away from one. Of course,
14160920	14164040	when b goes to negative territory, my graph doesn't make any sense.
14167800	14179160	So a changes the y intercept and b changes the steepness of the graph, whether it's increasing
14179160	14184760	for b values bigger than one and decreasing for values of b less than one.
14185720	14193720	We'll summarize all these observations on the next slide. We've seen that for an exponential
14193720	14201560	function, y equals a times b to the x, the parameter or number a gives the y intercept.
14202280	14207880	The parameter b tells us how the graph is increasing or decreasing. Specifically,
14207880	14216440	if b is greater than one, the graph is increasing. And if b is less than one, the graph is decreasing.
14218200	14221880	The closer b is to the number one, the flatter the graph.
14223240	14231800	So for example, if I were to graph y equals 0.25 to the x, and y equals 0.4 to the x,
14232760	14238200	they would both be decreasing graphs, since the base for both of them is less than one.
14238920	14247720	But 0.25 is farther away from one, and 0.4 is closer to one. So 0.4 is going to be flatter,
14247720	14255880	and 0.25 is going to be more steep. So in this picture, this red graph would correspond to
14255960	14261240	0.25 to the x, and the blue graph would correspond to 0.4 to the x.
14263240	14269000	For all these exponential functions, whether the graphs are decreasing or increasing,
14269000	14276120	they all have a horizontal asymptote along the x axis, in other words, at the line y equals zero.
14277080	14283480	The domain is always from negative infinity to infinity. And the range is always
14283880	14294040	from zero to infinity, because the range is always positive y values. Actually, that's true
14294600	14304920	if a is greater than zero. If a is less than zero, then our graph flips over the x axis. Our domain
14304920	14312360	stays the same, but our range becomes negative infinity to zero. The most famous exponential
14312360	14318440	function is f of x equals e to the x. This function is also sometimes written as f of x equals x of
14318440	14326040	x. The number e is Euler's number, and it's approximately 2.7. This function has important
14326040	14333240	applications to calculus and to some compound interest problems. In this video, we looked at
14333240	14340200	exponential functions, functions of the form a times b to the x, where the variable is in the exponent.
14340760	14351560	We saw that they all have the same general shape, either increasing like this, or decreasing like this,
14352520	14356760	unless a is negative, in which case they flip over the x axis.
14358600	14364520	They all have a horizontal asymptote at y equals zero, the x axis.
14364760	14371720	In this video, we'll use exponential functions to model real world examples.
14372760	14379160	Let's suppose you're hired for a job. The starting salary is $40,000, with a guaranteed
14379160	14387480	annual raise of 3% each year. How much will your salary be after one year? Two years, five years,
14387480	14394200	and in general after t years. Let me chart out the information. The left column will be the
14394200	14399080	number of years since you're hired, and the right column will be your salary.
14400920	14407000	When you start work, that's zero years after you're hired, your salary will be $40,000.
14409880	14417000	After one year, you'll have gotten a 3% raise. So your salary will be the original 40,000
14417640	14429160	plus 3% of 40,000. 0.03 times 40,000. I can think of this first number as one times 40,000.
14429720	14440600	And I can factor out the 40,000 from both terms to get 40,000 times one plus 0.03.
14440600	14450440	Let me rewrite this as 40,000 times 1.03. This is your original salary
14451240	14460520	multiplied by a growth factor of 1.03. After two years, you'll get a 3% raise
14460520	14467480	from your previous year salary. Your previous year salary was 40,000 times 1.03,
14468040	14477880	but you'll add 3% of that. Again, I can think of the first number as one times 40,000 times 1.03.
14478440	14487080	And I can factor out the common factor of 40,000 times 1.03 from both terms to get 40,000
14487960	14499720	times 1.03 times one plus 0.03. Let me rewrite that as 40,000 times 1.03 times 1.03,
14500360	14508440	or 40,000 times 1.03 squared. We can think of this as your last year's salary
14509240	14519240	multiplied by the same growth factor of 1.03. After three years, a similar computation will
14519240	14528040	give you that your new salary is your previous year's salary times that growth factor of 1.03.
14529160	14537480	That can be written as 40,000 times 1.03 cubed. And in general, if you're noticing the pattern
14537560	14547640	after T years, your salary should be 40,000 times 1.03 to the T power. In other words, your salary
14547640	14560600	after T years is your original salary multiplied by the growth factor of 1.03 taken to the T power.
14560920	14571640	Let me write this as a formula. S of T, where S of T is your salary, is equal to 40,000 times 1.03
14571640	14580440	to the T. This is an exponential function, that is a function of the form A times B to the T,
14581400	14593000	where your initial value A is 40,000, and your base B is 1.03. Notice that your base
14593000	14599880	is the amount that your salary gets multiplied by each year. Given this formula, we can easily
14599880	14605560	figure out what your salary will be after, for example, five years by plugging in five for T.
14606280	14615080	I worked that out on my calculator to be 46,370 dollars and 96 cents to the nearest cent.
14617400	14621160	Exponential functions are also useful in modeling population growth.
14621800	14628360	The United Nations estimated that the world population in 2010 was 6.79 billion, growing at
14628360	14633880	a rate of 1.1 percent per year. Assuming that the growth rate stayed the same and will continue
14633880	14640200	to stay the same, we'll write an equation for the population at T years after the year 2010.
14642280	14650600	1.1 percent, written as a decimal, is 0.011. So if we work out a chart as before,
14651800	14658920	we see that after zero years since 2010, we have our initial population, 6.79 billion.
14659480	14672040	After one year, we'll take that 6.79 billion and add 1.1 percent of it, that is 0.011 times 6.79.
14672760	14676520	This works out to 6.79 times
14677160	14690200	1 plus 0.011 or 6.79 times 1.011. Here we have our initial population
14691080	14701720	of 6.79 billion and our growth factor of 1.011. That's how much the population
14701720	14709880	got multiplied by in one year. As before, we can work out that after two years,
14709880	14720040	our population becomes 6.79 times 1.011 squared since it got multiplied by 1.011 twice. And after
14720040	14730920	two years, it'll be 6.79 times 1.011 to the T power. So our function that models population
14732280	14746200	is going to be 6.79 times 1.011 to the T. Here, T represents time in years since 2010.
14747160	14755320	Just for fun, I'll plug in T equals 40. That's 40 years since 2010. So that's the year
14755960	14766680	2050. And I get 6.79 times 1.011 to the 40th power, which works out to 10.5 billion.
14767480	14771080	That's the prediction based on this exponential model.
14771080	14778520	The previous two examples were examples of exponential growth. This last example
14778520	14784200	is an example of exponential decay. The drug Cerroquel is metabolized and eliminated from the
14784200	14792440	body at a rate of 11% per hour. If 400 milligrams are given, how much remains in the body 24 hours
14792440	14802840	later? I'll chart out my information where the left column will be time in hours since the dose
14802840	14809960	was given. And the right column will be the number of milligrams of Cerroquel still in the body.
14811400	14816360	Zero hours after the dose is given, we have the full 400 milligrams in the body.
14817240	14825720	One hour later, we have the 400 milligrams minus 11% of it. That's minus 0.11 times 400.
14827080	14839480	If I factor out the 400 from both terms, I get 400 times 1 minus 0.11, or 400 times 0.89.
14840360	14847960	The 400 represents the initial amount. The 0.89, I'll call the growth factor,
14847960	14853320	even though in this case, the quantity is decreasing, not growing. So really, it's kind of a shrink factor.
14857320	14865000	Let's see what happens after two hours. Now I'll have 400 times 0.89. My previous amount,
14865960	14873640	it'll again get multiplied by 0.89. So that's going to be 400 times 0.89 squared. And in general,
14873640	14881240	after t hours, I'll have 400 multiplied by this growth or shrinkage factor of 0.89
14881880	14889080	raised to the t power. Since each hour, the amount of Cerroquel gets multiplied by 0.89,
14889080	14897080	that number less than one. I'll write my exponential decay function as f of t equals 400
14897080	14906600	times 0.89 to the t, where f of t represents the number of milligrams of Cerroquel in the body,
14907560	14911880	and t represents the number of hours since the dose was given.
14912840	14919480	To find out how much is in the body after 24 hours, I just plug in 24 for t.
14921480	14929000	This works out to about 24.4 milligrams. I hope you noticed the common form for the functions
14929000	14935800	used to model all three of these examples. The functions were always in the form f of t equals
14935800	14945560	a times b to the t, where a represented the initial amount, and b represented the growth factor.
14948200	14953880	To find the growth factor b, we started with the percent increase or decrease.
14955080	14961320	We wrote it as a decimal. And then we either added it or subtracted it from one,
14961320	14967160	depending on whether the quantity was increasing or decreasing. Let me show you that as a couple
14967160	14977960	examples. In the first example, we had a percent increase of 3% on the raise. As a decimal, I'll
14977960	14987880	call this r, this was 0.03. And to get the growth factor, we added that to 1 to get 1.03. In the
14987880	14996520	world population example, we had a 1.1% increase. We wrote this as 0.011 and added it to 1
14999560	15010760	to get 1.011. In the drug example, we had a decrease of 11%. We wrote that as a decimal.
15011720	15023400	And we subtracted the 0.11 from one to get 0.89. In fact, you can always write the
15023400	15031480	growth factor b as 1 plus the percent change written as a decimal. If you're careful to
15031480	15037320	make that percent change negative when the quantity is decreasing and positive when the
15037320	15044760	quantity is increasing, since here one plus negative 0.11 gives us the correct growth factor of 0.89,
15044760	15051480	which is less than one. As a good check, remember that if your quantity is increasing,
15052920	15058360	the base b should be bigger than one. And if the quantity is decreasing,
15059800	15066520	then b should be less than one. Exponential functions can also be used to model bank accounts
15066520	15073160	and loans with compound interest, as we'll see in another video. This video is about
15073160	15080520	interpreting exponential functions. An antique car is worth $50,000 now, and its value increases by
15080520	15089960	7% each year. Let's write an equation to model its value x years from now. After one year, its value
15090200	15103480	is the 50,000 plus 0.07 times the 50,000. That's because its value has grown by 7% or 0.07
15103480	15114600	times 50,000. This can be written as 50,000 times one plus 0.07. Notice that adding 7%
15115560	15125000	to the original value is the same as multiplying the original value by one plus 0.07, or by 1.07.
15126840	15139000	After two years, the value will be 50,000 times one plus 0.07 squared, or 50,000 times
15139080	15146920	1.07 squared. That's because the previous year's value is multiplied again by 1.07.
15148680	15158280	And in general, after x years, v of x, the antique car's value will be 50,000
15159320	15168760	times 1.07 to the x. That's because the original value of 50,000 gets multiplied by 1.07
15168760	15174840	x times one time for each year. If we dissect this equation, we see that the
15175640	15183240	number of 50,000 comes from the original value of the car. The 1.07, which I call the growth factor,
15184920	15196520	comes from 1 plus 0.07. The 0.07 being the percent increase written as a decimal.
15196760	15204840	So the form of this equation is an exponential equation, v of x equals a times b to the x,
15204840	15213000	where a is the initial value, and b is the growth factor. But we could also write this as a times
15213000	15223080	one plus r to the x, where a is still the initial value, but r is the percent increase written
15223080	15231640	as a decimal. This same equation will come up in the next example. Here, my Toyota Prius is
15231640	15240120	worth only 3,000 now, and its value is decreasing by 5% each year. So after one year, its value
15240840	15256120	will be 3,000 minus 0.05 times 3,000. That is 3,000 times 1 minus 0.05. I can also write that as
15256120	15269880	3,000 times 0.95. Decreasing the value by 5% is like multiplying the value by one minus 0.05 or by
15269880	15283080	0.95. After two years, the value will be multiplied by 0.95 again. So the value will be 3,000 times
15283080	15295240	0.95 squared. And after x years, the value will be 3,000 times 0.95 to the x. So my equation for
15295240	15306760	the value is 3,000 times 0.95 to the x. This is again an equation of the form v of x equals a
15306760	15320440	times b to the x, where here a is 3,000, the initial value, and b is 0.95. I'll still call that the
15320440	15326760	growth factor, even though we're actually declining in value, not growing. Now remember where this
15326760	15336520	0.95 came from, it came from taking one and subtracting 0.05 because of the 5% decrease in value.
15337560	15344600	So I can again write my equation in the form a times, well this time times 1 minus r to the x,
15345320	15356040	where r is our 0.05, that's our percent decrease written as a decimal. Please take a moment to
15356040	15364120	study this equation and the previous one. These say that when you have an exponential function,
15365000	15372200	the number here is the initial value. If it's written in this form, b is your growth factor,
15372200	15378760	but you can think of b as being either 1 minus r, where r is the percent decrease,
15378760	15387240	or 1 plus r, where r is the percent increase. In this example, we're given a function f of x
15387240	15392920	to model the number of bacteria in a Petri dish, x hours after 12 o'clock noon.
15394360	15399240	We want to know what was the number of bacteria at noon and by what percent the number of bacteria
15399240	15405720	is increasing every hour. We can see from the equation that the number of bacteria is increasing
15405720	15411880	and not decreasing because the base of the exponential function, 1.45, is bigger than 1.
15411880	15422680	Notice that our equation f of x equals 12 times 1.45 to the x has the form of a times b to the x,
15422680	15434680	or we can think of it as a times 1 plus r to the x. Here a is 12, b is 1.45, and r is 0.45.
15435400	15443000	Based on this familiar form, we can recognize that the initial amount of bacteria is going to be 12,
15443800	15452600	12,000, since those are our units. And this value 1.45 is our growth factor,
15453720	15463800	what the number of bacteria is multiplied by each hour, while r, the 0.45, is the rate of increase.
15463800	15475960	In other words, a 45 percent increase each hour. So our answers to the questions are 12,000 and 45
15475960	15483480	percent. In this example, the population of salamanders is modeled by this exponential function,
15484200	15487000	where x is the number of years since 2015.
15487480	15496440	Notice that the number of salamanders is decreasing, because the base of our exponential function,
15496440	15505080	0.78, is less than 1. So if we recognize the form of our exponential function, a times b to the x,
15505080	15516680	or we can think of this as a times 1 minus r to the x, where a is our initial value and r is our
15517320	15527640	decrease, written as a decimal. Our initial value is 3000. So that's the number of salamanders
15527640	15539640	zero years after 2015. Our growth factor b is 0.78. But if I write that as 1 minus r, I see that r
15539640	15551240	has to be 1 minus 0.78 or 0.22. In other words, our population is decreasing by 22 percent each year.
15552600	15559560	In this video, we saw that exponential functions can be written in the form f of x equals a times
15559560	15567320	b to the x, where a is the initial value, and b is the growth factor.
15569400	15577080	We also saw that they can be written in the form a times 1 plus r to the x, when the amount is
15577080	15584360	increasing, and as a times 1 minus r to the x, when the amount is decreasing.
15584920	15594200	In this format, r is the percent increase, or the percent decrease, written as a decimal.
15596520	15610840	So a 15 percent increase will be an r value of 0.15 and a growth factor b of 1.15, whereas a 12
15610840	15626200	percent decrease will be an r value of 0.12 and a b value of 1 minus 0.12 or 0.88.
15627880	15634680	These observations help us quickly interpret exponential functions. For example, here we have
15635640	15645080	an initial value of 100 and a 15 percent increase, and here we have an initial value of 50 and
15646520	15648680	a 40 percent decrease.
15650680	15655640	Exponential functions can be used to model compound interest for loans and bank accounts.
15656760	15661880	Suppose you invest $200 in a bank account that earns 3 percent interest every year.
15661880	15668760	If you make no deposits or withdrawals, how much money will you have accumulated after 10 years?
15670120	15674360	Because 3 percent of the money that's in the bank is getting added each year,
15674360	15683400	the money in the bank gets multiplied by 1.03 each year. So after one year, the amount will be
15683400	15696520	200 times 1.03 after two years, 200 times 1.03 squared, and after T years, 200 times 1.03 to
15696520	15704520	the T power. So the function modeling the amount of money, I'll call it P of T, is given by 200
15704520	15711080	times 1.03 to the T. More generally, if you invest A dollars
15713160	15719080	at an annual interest rate of R for T years,
15721480	15727800	in the end, you'll have P of T equals A times 1 plus R to the T.
15728760	15737080	Here, R needs to be written as a decimal, so 0.03 in our example for the 3 percent annual interest rate.
15738440	15745400	Going back to our specific example, after 10 years, the amount of money is going to be P of 10,
15745400	15755240	which is 200 times 1.03 to the 10, which works out to $268.78 to the nearest cent.
15755320	15761160	In this problem, we've assumed that the interest accumulates once per year. But in the next few
15761160	15766120	examples, we'll see what happens when the interest rate accumulates more frequently, twice a year,
15766120	15774120	or every month, for example. Let's deposit $300 in an account that earns 4.5 percent annual
15774120	15780120	interest compounded semi-annually. This means two times a year, or every six months.
15780120	15792920	A 4.5 percent annual interest rate compounded two times a year means that we're actually getting
15792920	15801560	4.5 over 2 percent interest every time the interest is compounded, that is, every six months.
15802040	15818280	That's 2.25 percent interest every half a year. Note that 2.25 percent is the same as 0.025 as a
15818280	15831000	decimal. So every time we earn interest, our money gets multiplied by 1.025. Let me make a chart of
15831000	15839960	what happens. After zero years, which is also zero half years, we have our original $300.
15840920	15847720	After a half a year, that's one half year, our money gets earns interest one time. So we multiply
15847720	15857560	the 300 by 1.025. After one year, that's two half years, our money earns interest two times.
15857560	15869640	So we multiply 300 by 1.0 225 squared. Continuing this way, after 1.5 years, that's three half years,
15870200	15878360	we have 300 times 1.0 225 cubed. And after two years, or four half years, we have 300 times
15878360	15889640	1.0 225 to the fourth. In general, after T years, which is two T half years, our money will grow to
15889640	15901160	300 times 1.0 225 to the two T power, because we've compounded interest two T times. Our formula for
15901160	15910200	our amount of money is P of T equals 300 times 1.0 225 to the two T, where T is the number of years.
15912520	15922680	To finish the problem, after seven years, we'll have P of $7, which is 300 times 1.0 225 to the
15922680	15933800	two times seven or 14 power. And that works out to $409.65 to the nearest cent.
15935400	15941800	In this next example, we're going to take out a loan for $1,200 at an annual interest rate of 6%
15942360	15949560	compounded monthly. Although loans and bank accounts might feel different, they're mathematically the
15949560	15955240	same. It's like from the bank's point of view, they're investing money in you and getting interest
15955240	15963880	on their money from you. So we can work them out with the same kind of math. 6% annual interest rate
15965080	15973000	compounded monthly means you're compounding 12 times a year. So each time you compound interest,
15973000	15983800	you're just going to get 6 over 12% interest. That's 0.5% interest. And as a decimal, that's
15984360	15989960	0.005. Let's chart out again what happens.
15992280	16002360	Time zero, of course, you'll have the original loan amount of 1200. After one year, that's 12 months,
16003160	16013640	your loan has had interest added to it 12 times. So it gets multiplied by 1.005 to the 12th.
16015240	16023720	After two years, that's 24 months, it's had interest added to it 24 times. So it gets
16023720	16030920	multiplied by 1.005 to the 24th power. Similarly, after three years or 36 months,
16031480	16041720	your loan amount will be 1200 times 1.005 to the 36th power. And in general, after T years,
16042280	16051560	that's 12 T months. So the interest will be compounded 12 T times. And so we have to raise
16051560	16061160	the 1.005 to the 12 T power. This gives us the general formula for the money owed is P of T equals
16061720	16069320	1200 times 1.005 to the 12 T, where T is the number of years.
16071640	16080280	In particular, after three years, we'll have to pay back a total of 1200 times 1.005
16080280	16085240	to the 12 times three or 36 power, which works out to
16087240	16096360	$1,436.02 to the nearest cent. These last two problems follow a general pattern.
16097080	16105800	If A is the initial amount of the loan or bank account, and R is the annual interest rate,
16106120	16119080	compounded N times per year, then our formula for the amount of money is going to be A times
16119080	16128520	1 plus R over N to the NT. This formula exactly matches what we did in this problem. First,
16128520	16134920	we took the interest rate R, which was 6%, and divided it by the number of compounding periods
16134920	16142680	each year, 12. We wrote that as a decimal and added one to it. That's where we got the 1.005
16142680	16150200	from. We raised this to not to the number of years, but to 12 times the number of years.
16150200	16154120	That's the number of compounding periods per year times the number of years.
16155400	16159720	And we multiplied all that by the initial amount of money, which was 1200.
16160200	16165080	This formula for compounded interest is a good one to memorize, but it's also important to be able
16165080	16169880	to reason your way through it, like we did in this chart. There's one more type of compounded
16169880	16176120	interest, and that's interest compounded continuously. You can think of continuous compounding
16176120	16182680	as the limit of compounding more and more frequently. 10 times a year, 100 times a year,
16182680	16187560	1,000 times a year, a million times a year. In the limit, you get continuous compounding.
16187560	16196760	The formula for continuous compounding is p of t equals a times e to the rt,
16197480	16203640	where p of t is the amount of money. t is the time in years.
16205640	16208120	a is the initial amount of money.
16210120	16216760	And r is the annual interest rate written as a decimal.
16217720	16224600	So 0.025 in this problem from the 2.5% annual interest rate.
16225880	16232280	e represents the famous constant Euler's constant, which is about 2.718.
16233640	16243480	So in this problem, we have p of t is 4,000 times e to the 0.025 t.
16243720	16253000	And after five years, we'll have p of 5, which is 4,000 times e to the 0.025 times 5,
16254360	16261000	which works out to $4,532.59 to the nearest cent.
16262200	16268200	To summarize, if r represents the annual interest rate written as a decimal,
16268440	16280120	that is 2% would be 0.02, and t represents the number of years, and a represents the initial
16280120	16286920	amount of money, then for just simple annual interest compounded once a year, our formula
16286920	16295560	is p of t is a times 1 plus r to the t. For compound interest compounded n times per year,
16296280	16304920	our formula is p of t is a times 1 plus r over n to the nt. And for compound interest
16304920	16310760	compounded continuously, we get p of t is a times e to the rt.
16312760	16316280	In this video, we looked at three kinds of compound interest problems.
16317000	16324680	Simple annual interest, interest compounded n times per year, and continuously compounded interest.
16326520	16328760	This video introduces logarithms.
16330760	16339960	Logarithms are a way of writing exponents. The expression log base a of b equals c means that
16339960	16350840	a to the c equals b. In other words, log base a of b is the exponent that you raise a to to get b.
16351800	16358040	The number a is called the base of the logarithm. It's also called the base when we write it in
16358040	16365000	this exponential form. Some students find it helpful to remember this relationship log base a of b
16365000	16375800	equals c means a to the c equals b by drawing arrows a to the c equals b. Other students like
16375800	16385880	to think of it in terms of asking a question. log base a of b asks, what power do you raise a to
16387160	16397800	in order to get b? Let's look at some examples. log base two of eight is three, because two
16397880	16405400	to the three equals eight. In general, log base two of y is asking you the question,
16406040	16416040	what power do you have to raise two to to get y? So for example, log base two of 16 is four,
16416040	16422120	because it's asking you the question to to what power equals 16. And the answer is four.
16423080	16430280	Please pause the video and try some of these other examples. log base two of two is asking,
16430280	16435480	what power do you raise two to to get two? And the answer is one.
16438280	16447800	two to the one equals two. log base two of one half is asking two to what power gives you one
16447800	16454760	half. Well, to get one half, you need to raise two to a negative power. So that would be two
16454760	16463240	to the negative one. So the answer is negative one. log base two of one eighth means what power do
16463240	16472520	we raise two to in order to get one eighth. Since one eighth is one over two cubed, we have to raise
16472520	16481080	two to the negative three power to get one over two cubed. So our exponent is negative three.
16481080	16489720	And that's our answer to our log expression. Finally, log base two of one is asking to to what
16489720	16497400	power equals one. Well, anything raised to the zero power gives us one. So this log expression
16497400	16504520	evaluates to zero. Notice that we can get positive negative and zero answers for our
16504520	16510520	logarithm expressions. Please pause the video and figure out what these logs evaluate to
16512760	16517960	to work out log base 10 of a million. Notice that a million
16519560	16527240	is 10 to the sixth power. Now we're asking the question, what power do we raise 10 to to get
16527240	16532920	a million? So that is what power do we raise 10 to to get 10 to the sixth? Well, of course,
16532920	16542840	the answer is going to be six. Similarly, since point 001 is 10 to the minus three,
16543800	16549720	this log expression is the same thing as asking what's log base 10 of 10 to the minus three.
16550360	16556440	Well, what power do you have to raise 10 to to get 10 to the minus three? Of course, the answer
16556440	16565800	is negative three. log base 10 of zero is asking, what power do we raise 10 to to get zero?
16567160	16571880	Well, if you think about it, there's no way to raise 10 to an exponent to get zero.
16571880	16575560	Raising 10 to a positive exponent gets us really big positive numbers.
16576280	16581560	Raising 10 to a negative exponent is like one over 10 to a power. So that's giving us
16581560	16586040	tiny fractions, but there's still positive numbers, we're never going to get zero.
16587080	16592600	Even if we raise 10 to the zero power, we'll just get one. So there's no way to get zero. And the
16592600	16598920	log base 10 of zero does not exist. If you tried on your calculator using the log base 10 button,
16598920	16604840	you'll get an error message. Same thing happens when we do log base 10 of negative 100, we're
16604840	16609640	asking 10 to what power equals negative 100. And there's no exponent that will work.
16611640	16615240	And more generally, it's possible to take the log of numbers that are
16615880	16621400	greater than zero, but not for numbers that are less than or equal to zero.
16622200	16627960	In other words, the domain of the function log base a of x, no matter what base you're using for
16627960	16636920	a, the domain is going to be all positive numbers. A few notes on notation. When you see ln of x,
16636920	16643800	that's called natural log, and it means the log base e of x, where e is that famous number that's
16643800	16653160	about 2.718. When you see log of x with no base at all, by convention, that means log base 10 of x,
16653160	16660120	and it's called the common log. Most scientific calculators have buttons for natural log and for
16660120	16668360	common log. Let's practice rewriting expressions with logs in them. log base three of one ninth
16668360	16675960	is negative two can be rewritten as the expression three to the negative two equals one ninth.
16678760	16686600	log of 13 is shorthand for log base 10 of 13. So that can be rewritten as 10
16687240	16698520	to the 1.11394 equals 13. Finally, in this last expression, ln means natural log or log base e.
16698520	16706200	So I can rewrite this equation as log base e of one over e equals negative one. Well, that means
16706200	16714760	the same thing as e to the negative one equals one over e, which is true. Now let's go the opposite
16714760	16722200	direction. We'll start with exponential equations and rewrite them as logs. Remember that log base
16722200	16731400	a of b equals c means the same thing as a to the c equals b. The base stays the same in both
16731400	16739240	expressions. So for this example, the base of three in the exponential equation is going to be the
16739240	16744760	same as the base in our log. Now I just have to figure out what's in the argument of the log
16745400	16751800	and what goes on the other side of the equal sign. Remember that the answer to a log is an exponent.
16752760	16758120	So the thing that goes in this box should be my exponent for my exponential equation. In other
16758120	16770920	words, you and I'll put the 9.78 as the argument of my log. This works because log base three of
16770920	16779480	9.78 equals you means the same thing as three to the you equals 9.78, which is just what we started
16779480	16788040	with. In a second example, the base of my exponential equation is e. So the base of my log is going to
16788040	16796280	be e. The answer to my log is an exponent. In this case, the exponent three x plus seven.
16798920	16806840	And the other expression, the four minus y becomes my argument of my log. Let me check
16808360	16815240	log base e of four minus y equals three x plus seven means e to the three x plus seven equals four
16815240	16821720	minus y, which is just what I started with. I can also rewrite log base e as natural log.
16824440	16830760	This video introduced the idea of logs and the fact that log base a of b equals c
16831800	16841320	means the same thing as a to the c equals b. So log base a of b is asking the question
16841960	16846440	what power or exponent do you raise a to in order to get b?
16848760	16853560	In this video, we'll work out the graphs of some log functions and also talk about their domains.
16855240	16860520	For this first example, let's graph a log function by hand by plotting some points.
16861640	16868280	The function we're working with is y equals log base two of x. I'll make a chart of x and y values.
16869240	16872680	Since we're working this out by hand, I want to pick x values
16872680	16879240	for which it's easy to compute log base two of x. So I'll start out with the x value of one
16879240	16884920	because log base two of one is zero, log base anything of one is zero.
16886840	16893400	Two is another x value that's easy to compute log base two of two, that's asking what power do I
16893400	16897240	raise two to to get two? Well, and the answer is one.
16899160	16906680	Other powers of two are easy to work with. So for example, log base two of four, that's saying
16906680	16913640	what power do I raise two to to get four? So the answer is two. Similarly, log base two of eight
16913640	16921320	is three, and log base two of 16 is four. Let me also work with some fractional values for x.
16922120	16929640	If x is one half, then log base two of one half, that's saying what power do I raise two to
16929640	16936440	to get one half? Well, that needs a power of negative one. It's also easy to compute by hand
16937480	16945000	the log base two of one fourth and one eighth log base two of one fourth is negative two since
16945640	16953480	two to the negative two is one fourth. And similarly, log base two of one eighth is negative three.
16954280	16959720	I'll put some tick marks on my x and y axes. Please pause the video and take a moment to
16959720	16969320	plot these points. Let's see, I have the point one zero. That's here to one. That's here for two.
16970280	16979720	That is here. And then eight three, which is here. And the fractional x values one half goes
16979720	16986520	with negative one, and one fourth with negative two, one eighth with negative three. And if I
16986520	16992840	connect the dots, I get a graph that looks something like this. If I had smaller and smaller
16992840	16998360	fractions, I would keep getting more and more negative answers when I took log base two of
16998360	17004360	them. So my graph is getting more and more negative, my y values are getting more and more negative
17005160	17010760	as x is getting close to zero. Now I didn't draw any parts of the graph over here with
17010760	17017080	negative x values, and I didn't put any negative x values in my chart. That omission is is no accident
17017080	17024040	because if you try to take the log base two or base anything of a negative number, like say negative
17024600	17032200	four or something, there's no answer. This doesn't exist because there's no power that you can raise
17032840	17040920	two two to get a negative number. So there are no points on the graph for negative x values. And
17040920	17047720	similarly, there are no points on the graph where x is zero, because you can't take log base two of
17047720	17055080	zero, there's no power you can raise two to to get zero. I want to observe some key features of
17055080	17064280	this graph. First of all, the domain is x values greater than zero. In interval notation, I can
17064280	17072760	write that as a round bracket because I don't want to include zero to infinity. The range is going to
17072760	17079800	be the y values. Well, they go all the way down into the far reach of the negative numbers. And the
17079800	17086840	graph gradually increases y values getting bigger and bigger. So the range is actually all real numbers
17088280	17093320	or an interval notation negative infinity to infinity. Finally, I want to point out that
17093320	17104760	this graph has a vertical asymptote at the y axis, that is at the line x equals zero.
17106040	17111880	I'll draw that on my graph with a dotted line. A vertical asymptote is a line that
17111880	17118920	our functions graph gets closer and closer to. So this is the graph of y equals log base two of x.
17118920	17127800	But if I wanted to graph say, y equals log base 10 of x, it would look very similar. It would still
17127800	17133800	have a domain of x values greater than zero, a range of all real numbers, and a vertical asymptote
17133800	17140840	at the y axis. It would still go through the point one zero, but it would go through the point 10 one
17141480	17151000	instead, because log base 10 of 10 is one. It would look pretty much the same, just a lot flatter
17151000	17157960	over here. But even though it doesn't look like it with the way I've drawn it, it still gradually
17157960	17168360	goes up to and towards infinity. In fact, the graph of y equals log base any a of x for a bigger than
17168360	17176280	one looks pretty much the same, and has the same three properties. Now that we know what the basic
17176280	17181240	log graph looks like, we can plot at least rough graphs of other log functions without plotting
17181240	17188120	points. Here we have the graph of natural log of x plus five. And again, I'm just going to draw a
17188120	17192200	rough graph. If I did want to do a more accurate graph, I probably would want to plot some points.
17192840	17201000	But I know that roughly a log graph, if it was just like y equals ln of x, that would look something
17201000	17208360	like this, and it would go through the point one zero with a vertical asymptote along the y axis.
17209560	17216120	Now if I want to graph ln of x plus five, that just shifts our graph up by five units. It'll still
17216120	17220920	have the same vertical asymptote since a vertical line shifted up by five units is still a vertical
17220920	17228280	line. But instead of going through one zero, it'll go through the point one five. So I'll draw a rough
17228280	17237640	sketch here. Let's compare our starting function, y equals ln x, and the transformed version,
17237640	17245240	y equals ln x plus five, in terms of the domain, the range, and the vertical asymptote.
17245480	17254360	Our original function, y equals ln x had a domain of zero to infinity. Since adding five on the
17254360	17261960	outside affects the y values, and the domain is the x values, this transformation doesn't change
17261960	17270360	the domain. So the domain is still from zero to infinity. Now the range of our original y equals
17270360	17277560	ln x was from negative infinity to infinity. Shifting up by five does affect the y values,
17277560	17283320	and the range is talking about the y values. But since the original range was all real numbers,
17283320	17288040	if you add five to all set of all real numbers, you still get the set of all real numbers. So in
17288040	17294440	this case, the range doesn't change either. And finally, we already saw that the original vertical
17294440	17300520	asymptote of the y axis x equals zero, when we shift that up by five units, it's still the vertical
17300520	17308920	line x equals zero. In this next example, we're starting with a log base 10 function. And since
17308920	17317000	the plus two is on the inside, that means we shift that graph left by two. So I'll draw our basic log
17317320	17324920	function. Here's our basic log function. So I'll think of that as y equals log of x going
17324920	17331880	through the point one zero. Here's its vertical asymptote. Now I need to shift everything left
17331880	17340600	by two. So my vertical asymptote shifts left. And now it's at the line x equals negative two instead
17341080	17350120	of at x equals zero. And my graph, well, let's see my point one zero gets shifted to, let's say
17350120	17358920	negative one zero, since I'm subtracting two from the x's. And here's a rough sketch of the resulting
17358920	17368600	graph. Let's compare the features of the two graphs drawn here. We're talking about domains. The
17368600	17376920	original had a domain of from zero to infinity. But now I've shifted that left. So I've subtracted
17376920	17382120	two from all my x values. And here's my new domain, which I can also verify just by looking at the
17382120	17390920	picture. My range was originally from negative infinity to infinity. Well, shifting left only
17390920	17395480	affects the x value. So it doesn't even affect the range. So my range is still negative infinity
17395640	17403160	to infinity. My vertical asymptote was originally at x equals zero. And since I subtract two from
17403160	17409160	all my x values, that shifts it to x equals negative two. In this last problem, I'm not
17409160	17414920	going to worry about drawing this graph. I'll just use algebra to compute its domain. So let's
17414920	17420760	think about what's the issue when you're taking the logs of things? Well, you can't take the log
17420760	17427160	of a negative number or zero. So whatever's inside the argument of the log function, whatever's
17427160	17435640	being fed into log had better be greater than zero. So I'll write that down. We need two minus three x
17435640	17441560	to be greater than zero. Now it's a matter of solving an inequality. Two has got to be greater
17441560	17448360	than three x. So two thirds is greater than x. In other words, x has to be less than two thirds.
17448360	17455720	So our domain is all the x values from negative infinity to two thirds, not including two thirds.
17457080	17461880	It's a good idea to memorize the basic shape of the graph of a log function.
17463960	17469480	It looks something like this goes through the point one zero and has a vertical asymptote
17469480	17474120	on the y axis. Also, if you remember that you can't take the log
17474360	17482520	of a negative number or zero, then that helps you quickly compute domains for log functions.
17484680	17489560	Whatever's inside the log function, you set that greater than zero and solve.
17493080	17498760	This video is about combining functions by adding them, subtracting them, multiplying them, and
17498760	17505960	dividing them. Suppose we have two functions f of x equals x plus one and g of x equals x squared.
17507320	17515560	One way to combine them is by adding them together. This notation f plus g of x means the function
17515560	17525400	defined by taking f of x and adding it to g of x. So for our functions, that means we take x plus one
17525400	17531400	and add x squared. I can rearrange that as the function x squared plus x plus one.
17533000	17539800	So f plus g evaluated on x means x squared plus x plus one.
17540760	17548280	And if I wanted to evaluate f plus g on the number two, that would be two squared plus two plus one
17548280	17558280	or seven. Similarly, the notation f minus g of x means the function we get by taking f of x and
17558280	17565080	subtracting g of x. So that would be x plus one minus x squared. And if I wanted to take
17565800	17574680	f minus g evaluated at one, that would be one plus one minus one squared or one.
17575880	17582520	The notation f dot g of x, which is sometimes also written just as f g of x,
17583080	17591800	that means we take f of x times g of x. In other words, x plus one times x squared,
17591800	17595080	which could be simplified as x cube plus x squared.
17596920	17607080	The notation f divided by g of x means I take f of x and divide it by g of x. So that would be x
17607080	17617080	plus one divided by x squared. In this figure, the blue graph represents h of x. And the red
17617080	17623480	graph represents the function p of x. We're asked to find h minus p of zero.
17625720	17630600	We don't have any equations to work with, but that's okay. We know that for any x,
17631160	17640040	h minus p of x is defined as h of x minus p of x. So for x equals zero, h minus p of zero
17640040	17646760	is going to be h of zero minus p of zero. Using the graph, we can find h of zero
17647560	17655240	by finding the value of zero on the x axis and finding the corresponding y value for the function
17655240	17665240	h of x. So that's about 1.8. Now p of zero, we can find similarly by looking for zero on the x axis
17665240	17670440	and finding the corresponding y value for the function p of x. And that's a y value of one.
17671800	17678680	1.8 minus one is 0.8. So that's our approximate value for h minus p of zero.
17680680	17688920	If we want to find p times h of negative three, again, we can rewrite that as p of negative three
17688920	17695800	times h of negative three. And using the graphs, we see that for an x value of negative three,
17695800	17706600	the y value for p is two. And the x value of negative three corresponds to a y value of negative
17706600	17714920	two for h. Two times negative two is negative four. So that's our value for p times h of negative
17714920	17722200	three. In this video, we saw how to add two functions, subtract two functions, multiply two
17722200	17731240	functions, and divide two functions in the following way. When you compose two functions,
17731880	17739080	you apply the first function. And then you apply the second function to the output of the first
17739080	17747000	function. For example, the first function might compute population size from time in years.
17747960	17754680	So its input would be time in years, since a certain date, and its output would be
17754680	17763160	number of people in the population. The second function g might compute healthcare costs
17763880	17771800	as a function of population size. So it will take population size as input, and its output
17771800	17778360	will be healthcare costs. If you put these functions together, that is, compose them,
17778360	17785000	then you'll go all the way from time in years to healthcare costs. This is your composition,
17785720	17793720	g composed with f. The composition of two functions, written g with a little circle
17793720	17803560	f of x, is defined as follows. g composed with f of x is g evaluated on f of x.
17804600	17811000	We can think of it schematically in this diagram. f acts on a number x and produces
17811000	17820520	a number f of x. Then g takes that output f of x and produces a new number g of f of x.
17821800	17826680	Our composition of functions g composed with f is the function that goes all the way from x
17827320	17834920	to g of f of x. Let's work out some examples where our functions are defined by tables of values.
17835880	17844840	If we want to find g composed with f of four, by definition, this means g of f of four.
17845800	17852520	To evaluate this expression, we always work from the inside out. So we start with the x value of four
17853160	17859880	and we find f of four using the table of values for f of x. When x equals four,
17860840	17866760	f of x is seven. So we can replace f of four with the number seven.
17867960	17875400	Now we need to evaluate g of seven. Seven becomes our new x value in our table of values for g.
17876280	17884040	The x value of seven corresponds to the g of x value of ten. So g of seven is equal to ten.
17884360	17892360	We found that g composed with f of four is equal to ten. If instead we want to find f composed with g
17892360	17901400	of four, well we can rewrite that as f of g of four and again work from the inside out. Now we're
17901400	17909080	trying to find g of four. So four is our x value and we use our table of values for g to see that g
17909240	17918440	of four is one. So we replace g of four by one and now we need to evaluate f of one. Using our
17918440	17929400	table for f values, f of one is eight. Notice that when we've computed g of f of four, we got a
17929400	17937480	different answer than when we computed f of g of four. And in general, g composed with f is not the
17938280	17944280	same thing as f composed with g. Please pause the video and take a moment to compute the next two
17944280	17952840	examples. We can replace f composed with f of two by the equivalent expression f of f of two.
17953800	17961720	Working from the inside out, we know that f of two is three and f of three is six.
17962040	17970040	If we want to find f composed with g of six, rewrite that as f of g of six using the table
17970040	17981880	for g, g of six is eight. But f of eight, eight is not on the table as an x value for the for the f
17981880	17990360	function. And so there is no f of eight. This does not exist. We can say that six is not
17990600	18002120	in the domain for f composed with g. Even though it was in the domain of g, we couldn't follow all
18002120	18009000	the way through and get a value for f composed with g of six. Next, let's turn our attention to
18009000	18015960	the composition of functions that are given by equations. p of x is x squared plus x and q of
18015960	18024600	x is negative two x. We want to find q composed with p of one. As usual, I can rewrite this as q
18024600	18035320	of p of one and work from the inside out. p of one is one squared plus one. So that's two.
18036200	18044760	So this is the same thing as q of two. But q of two is negative two times two or negative four.
18044760	18051480	So this evaluates to negative four. In this next example, we want to find q composed with p of some
18051480	18061880	arbitrary x. I'll rewrite it as usual as q of p of x and work from the inside out. Well, p of x,
18062440	18069000	we know the formula for that, that's x squared plus x. So I can replace my p of x with that
18069000	18078520	expression. Now, I'm stuck with evaluating q on x squared plus x. Well, q of anything is negative
18078520	18086920	two times that thing. So q of x squared plus x is going to be negative two times the quantity
18086920	18093080	x squared plus x. What I've done is I've substituted in the whole expression x squared plus x,
18093160	18099160	where I saw the x in this formula for q of x. It's important to use the parentheses here so
18099160	18103800	that we'll be multiplying negative two by the whole expression and not just by the first piece.
18104680	18110760	I can simplify this a bit as negative two x squared minus two x. And that's my expression
18111320	18118440	for q composed with p of x. Notice that if I wanted to compute q composed with p of one,
18119400	18125080	which I already did in the first problem, I could just use this expression now negative two times
18125080	18132920	one squared minus two, and I get negative four, just like I did before. Let's try another one.
18132920	18141240	Let's try p composed with q of x. First, I read write this p of q of x working from the inside
18141240	18147880	out, I can replace q of x with negative two x. So I need to compute p of negative two x.
18149400	18156200	Here's my formula for p to compute p of this expression, I need to plug in this expression
18156200	18165800	everywhere I see an x in the formula for p. So that means negative two x squared plus negative
18165800	18171080	two x. Again, being careful to use parentheses to make sure I plug in the entire expression
18171640	18181160	in for x. Let me simplify, this is four x squared minus two x. Notice that I got different expressions
18181720	18191720	for q of p of x, and for p of q of x. Once again, we see that q composed with p is not
18191720	18199000	necessarily equal to p composed with q. Please pause the video and try this last example yourself.
18199880	18209800	Rewriting and working from the inside out, we can replace p of x with its expression x squared
18209800	18219400	plus x. And then we need to evaluate p on x squared plus x. That means we plug in x squared plus x
18220120	18225960	everywhere we see an x in this formula. So that's x squared plus x quantity squared plus
18226600	18233960	x squared plus x. Once again, I can simplify by distributing out that gives me x to the fourth
18233960	18243320	plus two x cubed plus x squared plus x squared plus x or x to the fourth plus two x cubed plus
18243320	18251400	two x squared plus x. In this last set of examples, we're asked to go backwards. We're given a formula
18251400	18258120	for a function of h of x, but we're supposed to rewrite h of x as a composition of two functions
18258120	18264200	f and g. Let's think for a minute, which of these two functions gets applied first?
18264840	18273320	f composed with g of x, let's see, that means f of g of x. And since we evaluate these expressions
18273320	18281720	from the inside out, we must be applying g first, and then f. In order to figure out what
18281720	18288200	f and g could be, I like to draw a box around something inside my expression for h. So I'm
18288200	18294040	going to draw a box around x squared plus seven. Then whatever's inside the box, that'll be my
18294040	18299720	function g of x the first function that gets applied. Whatever happens to the box, in this case
18299720	18307880	taking the square root sign, that becomes my outside function, my second function f. So here,
18307880	18315320	we're going to say g of x is equal to x squared plus seven. And f of x is equal to the square root
18315320	18321400	of x. Let's just check and make sure that this works. So I need to check that when I take the
18321400	18331240	composition, f composed with g, I need to get the same thing as my original h. So let's see,
18331240	18339880	if I do f composed with g of x, well by definition, that's f of g of x, working from the inside out,
18339880	18346600	I can replace g of x with its formula x squared plus seven. So I need to evaluate f of x squared
18346600	18355800	plus seven. That means I plug in x squared plus seven into the formula for for f. So that becomes
18355800	18361720	the square root of x squared plus seven. Tada, it works because it matches my original equation.
18362680	18367800	So we found a correct answer, a correct way of breaking h down as a composition of two functions.
18367800	18374200	But I do want to point out, this is not the only correct answer. I'll write down my formula for h
18374280	18379880	of x again. And this time I'll put the box in a different place. I'll just box the x squared.
18380680	18390440	If I did that, then my inside function, my first function g of x would be x squared. And my second
18390440	18398680	function is what happens to the box. So my f of x is what happens to the box. And the box gets
18399320	18405320	added seven to it and taken the square root. So in other words, f of x is going to be
18406120	18413640	the square root of x plus seven. Again, I can check that this works. If I do f composed with
18413640	18421560	g of x, that's f of g of x. So now g of x is x squared. So I'm taking f of x squared. When I
18421560	18427880	plug in x squared for x, I do in fact get the square root of x squared plus seven. So this is
18427880	18435960	an alternative correct solution. In this video, we learned to evaluate the composition of functions
18436920	18444520	by rewriting it and working from the inside out. We also learned to break apart a complicated
18444520	18453000	function into a composition of two functions by boxing one piece of the function. And letting
18453000	18458760	the first function applied in the composition, let that be the inside of the box. And the second
18458760	18461960	function applied in the composition be whatever happens to the box.
18462360	18479000	The inverse of a function undoes what the function does. So the inverse of tying your shoes would
18479000	18487640	be to untie them. And the inverse of the function that adds two to a number would be the function
18487640	18493480	that subtracts two from a number. This video introduces inverses and their properties.
18494600	18500840	Suppose f of x is the function defined by this chart. In other words, f of two is three,
18500840	18509320	f of three is five, f of four is six, and f of five is one. The inverse function for f,
18509320	18517400	written f superscript negative one x undoes what f does. Since f takes two to three,
18518520	18526440	f inverse takes three back to two. So we write this f superscript negative one of three is two.
18528360	18535560	Similarly, since f takes three to five, f inverse takes five to three.
18536120	18544840	And since f takes four to six, f inverse of six is four. And since f takes five to one,
18544840	18552200	f inverse of one is five. I'll use these numbers to fill in the chart. Notice that the chart of
18552200	18559080	values when y equals f of x and the chart of values when y equals f inverse of x are closely
18559960	18567480	related. They share the same numbers, but the x values for f of x correspond to the y values
18567480	18574840	for f inverse of x. And the y values for f of x correspond to the x values for f inverse of x.
18575800	18581080	That leads us to the first key fact. Inverse functions reverse the roles of y and x.
18581560	18589160	I'm going to plot the points for y equals f of x in blue. Next, I'll plot the points for y equals f
18589160	18595480	inverse of x in red. Pause the video for a moment and see what kind of symmetry you observe in this
18595480	18601160	graph. How are the blue points related to the red points? You might have noticed that the blue
18601160	18609880	points and the red points are mirror images over the mirror line y equals x. So our second key fact
18610520	18616920	is that the graph of y equals f inverse of x can be obtained from the graph of y equals f of x by
18616920	18625800	reflecting over the line y equals x. This makes sense because inverses reverse the roles of y and x.
18627560	18634920	In this same example, let's compute f inverse of f of two. This open circle means composition. In
18635320	18643160	other words, we're computing f inverse of f of two. We compute this from the inside out. So that's
18643160	18657800	f inverse of three, since f of two is three, and f inverse of three, we see as two. Similarly, we can
18657880	18668760	compute f of f inverse of three. And that means we take f of f inverse of three. Since f inverse
18668760	18678600	of three is two, that's the same thing as computing f of two, which is three. Please pause the video
18678600	18688840	for a moment and compute these other compositions. You should have found that in every case, if you
18688840	18695240	take f inverse of f of a number, you get back to the very same number you started with. And similarly,
18695240	18700120	if you take f of f inverse of any number, you get back to the same number you started with.
18700360	18709560	So in general, f inverse of f of x is equal to x, and f of f inverse of x is also equal to x. This
18709560	18716040	is the mathematical way of saying that f and f inverse undo each other. Let's look at a different
18716040	18722760	example. Suppose that f of x is x cubed. Pause the video for a moment and guess what the inverse
18722840	18728360	of f should be. Remember, f inverse undoes the work that f does.
18731400	18738120	You might have guessed that f inverse of x is going to be the cube root function. Now we can
18738120	18746440	check that this is true by looking at f of f inverse of x, that's f of the cube root of function,
18746440	18753720	which means the cube root function cubed, which gets us back to x. Similarly, if we compute f
18753720	18762280	inverse of f of x, that's the cube root of x cubed, and we get back to x again. So the cube
18762280	18767640	root function really is the inverse of the cubing function. When we compose the two functions,
18767640	18775160	we get back to the number that we started with. It'd be nice to have a more systematic way of
18775240	18782840	finding inverses of functions besides guessing and checking. One method uses the fact that inverses
18782840	18789080	reverse the roles of y and x. So if we want to find the inverse of the function f of x equals
18789080	18797880	five minus x over three x, we can write it as y equals five minus x over three x. Reverse the
18797880	18808840	roles of y and x to get x equals five minus y over three y, and then solve for y. To solve for y,
18808840	18817080	let's multiply both sides by three y. Bring all terms with y's in them to the left side,
18817640	18822760	and all terms without y's in them to the right side. Factor out the y
18823240	18836040	and divide to isolate y. This gives us f inverse of x as five over three x plus one.
18837640	18843880	Notice that our original function f and our inverse function f inverse are both rational
18843880	18850760	functions, but they're not the reciprocals of each other. And in general, f inverse of x is not
18850760	18859240	usually equal to one over f of x. This can be confusing, because when we write two to the minus
18859240	18867080	one, that does mean one over two. But f to the minus one of x means the inverse function and not
18867080	18874840	the reciprocal. It's natural to ask if all functions have inverse functions. That is, for any
18874840	18882280	function you might encounter, is there always a function that is its inverse? In fact, the answer
18882280	18890120	is no. See if you can come up with an example of a function that does not have an inverse function.
18891560	18897720	The word function here is key. Remember that a function is a relationship between x values and
18897800	18907320	y values, such that for each x value in the domain, there's only one corresponding y value.
18910440	18918040	One example of a function that does not have an inverse function is the function f of x equals x
18918040	18927320	squared. To see that the inverse of this function is not a function, note that for the x squared
18927320	18936920	function, the number two and the number negative two both go to number four. So if I had an inverse,
18937800	18944520	it would have to send four to both two and negative two. The inverse would not be a function.
18945960	18950920	It might be easier to understand the problem when you look at a graph of y equals x squared.
18950920	18961480	Recall that inverse functions reverse the roles of y and x and flip the graph over the line y equals
18961480	18969240	x. But when I flip the green graph over the line y equals x, I get this red graph. This red graph
18969240	18974680	is not the graph of a function because it violates the vertical line test. The reason
18974680	18980200	that violates the vertical line test is because the original green function violates the horizontal
18980200	18990520	line test and has two x values with the same y value. In general, a function f has an inverse
18990520	18996600	function if and only if the graph of f satisfies the horizontal line test, i.e. every horizontal line
18996600	19002840	intersects the graph in at most one point. Pause the video for a moment and see which of these
19002840	19009080	four graphs satisfy the horizontal line test. In other words, which of the four corresponding
19009080	19016520	functions would have an inverse function? You may have found that graphs A and B
19017480	19022600	violate the horizontal line test. So their functions would not have inverse functions.
19023320	19030200	But graphs C and D satisfy the horizontal line test. So these graphs represent functions that
19030200	19036920	do have inverses. Functions that satisfy the horizontal line test are sometimes called
19036920	19045400	one-to-one functions. Equivalently, a function is one-to-one if for any two different x values,
19046200	19054760	x1 and x2, the y values f of x1 and f of x2 are different numbers. Sometimes as I said,
19055320	19064680	f is one-to-one if whenever f of x1 is equal to f of x2, then x1 has to equal x2.
19064920	19072200	As our last example, let's try to find p inverse of x, where p of x is the square root of x minus
19072200	19080200	2 drawn here. If we graph p inverse on the same axis as p of x, we get the following graph,
19081000	19087720	simply by flipping over the line y equals x. If we try to solve the problem algebraically,
19088520	19094440	we can write y equal to square root of x minus 2, reverse the roles of y and x,
19095320	19100200	and solve for y by squaring both sides and adding 2.
19104040	19110040	Now if we were to graph y equals x squared plus 2, that would look like a parabola. It would look
19110040	19117400	like the red graph we've already drawn together with another arm on the left side.
19117960	19123480	But we know that our actual inverse function consists only of this right arm.
19126520	19134200	We can specify this algebraically by making the restriction that x has to be bigger than or equal
19134200	19143160	to zero. This corresponds to the fact that on the original graph for the square root of x, y was
19143160	19150200	only greater than or equal to zero. Looking more closely at the domain and range of p and p inverse,
19150760	19159400	we know that the domain of p is all values of x such that x minus 2 is greater than or equal to
19159400	19165800	zero, since we can't take the square root of a negative number. This corresponds to x values
19165800	19171000	being greater than or equal to 2, or an interval notation, the interval from 2 to infinity.
19171480	19178200	The range of p we can see from the graph is all y values greater than or equal to 0, or the interval
19178200	19188280	from 0 to infinity. Similarly, based on the graph, we see the domain of p inverse is x values greater
19188280	19195880	than or equal to 0, the interval from 0 to infinity, and the range of p inverse is y values greater
19196680	19203720	than or equal to 2, or the interval from 2 to infinity. If you look closely at these domains
19203720	19209880	and ranges, you'll notice that the domain of p corresponds exactly to the range of p inverse,
19210440	19218760	and the range of p corresponds to the domain of p inverse. This makes sense because inverse
19218760	19227000	functions reverse the rules of y and x. The domain of f inverse of x is the x values for f inverse,
19227000	19234840	which corresponds to the y values, or the range of f. The range of f inverse is the y values for
19234840	19243880	f inverse, which correspond to the x values, or the domain of f. In this video, we discussed five
19243880	19250440	key properties of inverse functions. Inverse functions reverse the roles of y and x.
19252600	19260600	The graph of y equals f inverse of x is the graph of y equals f of x
19261720	19270280	reflected over the line y equals x. When we compose f with f inverse, we get the identity
19270280	19278600	function y equals x. And similarly, when we compose f inverse with f, that brings x to x.
19278600	19287720	In other words, f and f inverse undo each other. The function f of x has an inverse function,
19289560	19298600	if and only if the graph of y equals f of x satisfies the horizontal line test.
19300520	19314040	And finally, the domain of f is the range of f inverse. And the range of f is the domain of f
19314040	19321640	inverse. These properties of inverse functions will be important when we study exponential functions
19321640	19324600	and their inverses logarithmic functions.
