00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,200
This video is about the exponent rules, rules that govern expressions like two to the fifth

2
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:09,940
or x to the n.

3
00:00:09,940 --> 00:00:16,720
Two to the fifth is just shorthand for two times two times two times two times two, written

4
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:25,660
five times, and similarly x to the n is just x multiplied by itself, n times.

5
00:00:25,660 --> 00:00:31,300
When we write these expressions, the number on the bottom that's being multiplied by itself

6
00:00:31,300 --> 00:00:37,900
is called the base, and the number at the top telling us how many times we're multiplying

7
00:00:37,900 --> 00:00:42,180
the base by itself is called the exponent.

8
00:00:42,180 --> 00:00:47,220
Sometimes the exponent is also called the power.

9
00:00:47,220 --> 00:00:54,780
The product rule says that a five x to the power of n times x to the power of m, that's

10
00:00:54,780 --> 00:00:59,540
the same thing as x to the n plus m power.

11
00:00:59,540 --> 00:01:11,300
In other words, when I multiply two expressions with the same base, then I can add their exponents.

12
00:01:11,300 --> 00:01:17,260
For example, if I have two cubed times two to the fourth, that's equal to two to the

13
00:01:17,260 --> 00:01:24,020
seventh, and that makes sense because two cubed times two to the fourth means I multiply

14
00:01:24,260 --> 00:01:31,220
two by itself three times, and then I multiply that by two multiplied by itself four times,

15
00:01:31,220 --> 00:01:40,860
and in the end, I have two multiplied by itself seven times, which is two to the seventh.

16
00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:45,420
I'm just adding up the number of times that's multiplied in each piece to get the number

17
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:48,460
of times that's multiplied total.

18
00:01:48,460 --> 00:01:54,860
The quotient rule says that a five x to the n power divided by x to the m power, that's

19
00:01:54,860 --> 00:01:58,500
equal to x to the n minus m power.

20
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:05,740
In other words, if I divide two expressions with the same base, then I can subtract their

21
00:02:05,740 --> 00:02:08,940
exponents.

22
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:14,700
For example, three to the sixth divided by three squared is going to be three to the

23
00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:18,180
six minus two, or three to the fourth.

24
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:23,980
And this makes sense because three to the sixth means I multiply three by itself six

25
00:02:23,980 --> 00:02:29,580
times, and then I divide that by three multiplied by itself twice.

26
00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:34,300
So when I cancel out threes, I have four threes left.

27
00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:38,620
Notice that I have to subtract the number of threes on the bottom from the number of

28
00:02:38,620 --> 00:02:42,860
threes at the top to get my number of threes remaining.

29
00:02:42,860 --> 00:02:46,180
That's why I subtract my exponents.

30
00:02:46,180 --> 00:02:52,300
The power rule tells us if I have x to the n power raised to the m power, that's the

31
00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:56,860
same thing as x to the n times m power.

32
00:02:56,860 --> 00:03:05,700
In other words, when I raise a power to a power, I get to multiply the exponents.

33
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:13,380
For example, five to the fourth cubed is equal to five to the four times three, or five to

34
00:03:13,380 --> 00:03:14,700
the twelfth.

35
00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:20,180
And this makes sense because five to the fourth cubed can be thought of as five to the fourth

36
00:03:20,180 --> 00:03:25,740
times five to the fourth times five to the fourth, expanding this out some more.

37
00:03:25,740 --> 00:03:33,900
That's five times five times five times five times the same thing times the same thing

38
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:36,180
again.

39
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:47,820
So I have three groups of four fives, which is a total of three times four or twelve fives.

40
00:03:47,820 --> 00:03:53,100
The next rule involves what happens when I raise a number or a variable to the zeroth

41
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:54,380
power.

42
00:03:54,380 --> 00:03:59,660
It turns out that anything to the zeroth power is equal to one.

43
00:03:59,660 --> 00:04:05,140
Usually this is just taken as a definition, but here's why it makes sense to me.

44
00:04:05,140 --> 00:04:11,420
If you have something like two cubed divided by two cubed, well, certainly that has to

45
00:04:11,420 --> 00:04:12,660
equal one.

46
00:04:12,660 --> 00:04:15,340
Anything divided by itself is just one.

47
00:04:15,340 --> 00:04:22,660
But using the quotient rule, we know that this is the same thing as two to the three

48
00:04:22,660 --> 00:04:24,380
minus three.

49
00:04:24,380 --> 00:04:30,420
Because when we divide two things with the same base, we get to subtract their exponents.

50
00:04:30,420 --> 00:04:34,420
Therefore, this is the same thing as two to the zero.

51
00:04:34,420 --> 00:04:41,020
So two to the zero has to equal one in order to make it work with the quotient rule.

52
00:04:41,020 --> 00:04:47,180
And the same argument shows that anything to the zero power has to be equal to one.

53
00:04:47,180 --> 00:04:52,020
What happens when we take something to a negative power?

54
00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:57,100
X to the n is equal to one over x to the n.

55
00:04:57,100 --> 00:05:02,060
Again, most people just take this as a definition of a negative exponent, but here's why it

56
00:05:02,060 --> 00:05:04,540
makes sense.

57
00:05:04,540 --> 00:05:10,180
If I take something like five to the seventh times five to the negative seventh, then by

58
00:05:10,180 --> 00:05:16,540
the product rule, this has to equal five to the seven plus negative seven, which is five

59
00:05:16,540 --> 00:05:17,700
to the zero.

60
00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:21,580
And we just said that that is equal to one.

61
00:05:21,580 --> 00:05:25,460
Now I have the equation five to the seventh times five to the negative seventh equals

62
00:05:25,460 --> 00:05:26,460
one.

63
00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:31,780
If I divide both sides by five to the seventh, I get that five to the negative seventh has

64
00:05:31,780 --> 00:05:34,660
to equal one over five to the seventh.

65
00:05:34,660 --> 00:05:37,700
So that's where this rule about negative exponents comes from.

66
00:05:37,700 --> 00:05:42,100
It has to be true in order to be consistent with the product rule.

67
00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:45,700
Finally, let's look at a fractional exponent.

68
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:49,940
What does an expression like x to the one over n really mean?

69
00:05:49,940 --> 00:05:54,900
Well, it means the nth root of x.

70
00:05:54,900 --> 00:06:02,380
For example, 64 to the one third power means the cube root of 64, which happens to be four.

71
00:06:02,380 --> 00:06:07,860
And nine to the one half means the square root of nine, which is usually written without

72
00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:11,100
that little superscript up there.

73
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:15,020
Now the square root of nine is just three.

74
00:06:15,020 --> 00:06:17,100
Fractional exponents also make sense.

75
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:27,140
For example, if I have five to the one third and I cube that, then by the power rule, that's

76
00:06:27,140 --> 00:06:34,820
equal to five to the one third times three, which is just five to the one or five.

77
00:06:34,820 --> 00:06:40,780
So in other words, five to the one third is the number that when you cube it, you get

78
00:06:40,780 --> 00:06:42,100
five.

79
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:45,620
And that's exactly what's meant by the cube root of five.

80
00:06:45,620 --> 00:06:51,740
The cube root of five is also a number that when you cube it, you get five.

81
00:06:51,740 --> 00:06:56,900
The next rule tells us we can distribute an exponent over a product.

82
00:06:56,900 --> 00:07:03,180
In other words, if we have a product x times y all raised to the nth power, that's equal

83
00:07:03,180 --> 00:07:07,100
to x to the n times y to the n.

84
00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:14,980
For example, five times seven, all raised to the third power is equal to five cubed

85
00:07:14,980 --> 00:07:16,940
times seven cubed.

86
00:07:16,940 --> 00:07:23,500
And this makes sense because five times seven, all raised to the cube power can be expanded

87
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:29,340
as five times seven times five times seven times five times seven.

88
00:07:29,340 --> 00:07:34,260
But if I rearrange the order of multiplication, this is the same thing as five times five

89
00:07:34,260 --> 00:07:40,780
times five times seven times seven times seven or five cubed times seven cubed.

90
00:07:40,780 --> 00:07:45,060
Similarly, we could distribute an exponent over quotient.

91
00:07:45,060 --> 00:07:50,700
If we have the quotient x over y, all raised to the n power, that's the same as x to the

92
00:07:50,700 --> 00:07:53,620
n over y to the n.

93
00:07:53,620 --> 00:08:00,060
For example, two sevenths raised to the fifth power is the same thing as two to the fifth

94
00:08:00,060 --> 00:08:01,940
over seven to the fifth.

95
00:08:01,940 --> 00:08:09,180
This makes sense because two sevenths to the fifth can be expanded as two sevenths multiplied

96
00:08:09,180 --> 00:08:16,340
by itself five times, which can be written rewritten as two multiplied by itself five

97
00:08:16,340 --> 00:08:21,100
times divided by seven multiplied by itself five times.

98
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:27,540
And that's two to the fifth over seven to the fifth as wanted.

99
00:08:27,540 --> 00:08:37,220
We've seen that we can distribute an exponent over multiplication and division, but be careful

100
00:08:37,220 --> 00:08:44,900
because we cannot distribute an exponent over addition or subtraction.

101
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:53,660
For example, a plus b to the n is not generally equal to a to the n plus b to the n.

102
00:08:53,660 --> 00:08:59,460
A minus b to the n is not generally equal to a to the n minus b to the n.

103
00:08:59,460 --> 00:09:04,580
And if you're not sure, just try an example with numbers.

104
00:09:04,580 --> 00:09:13,140
For example, two plus three squared is not the same thing as two squared plus three squared.

105
00:09:13,140 --> 00:09:20,660
And two minus three squared is definitely not equal to two squared minus three squared.

106
00:09:20,660 --> 00:09:25,620
In this video, I gave eight exponent rules, which I'll list again here.

107
00:09:25,620 --> 00:09:34,820
There's the product rule, the quotient rule, the power rule, the zero exponent, the negative

108
00:09:34,820 --> 00:09:44,260
exponent, the fractional exponent, and there are the two rules involving distributing exponents

109
00:09:44,260 --> 00:09:50,580
across multiplication and division.

110
00:09:50,580 --> 00:09:55,780
In another video, I'll use these exponent rules to rewrite and simplify expressions

111
00:09:55,780 --> 00:09:58,900
involving exponents.

112
00:09:58,900 --> 00:10:03,380
In this video, I'll work out some examples of simplifying expressions using exponent

113
00:10:03,380 --> 00:10:04,380
rules.

114
00:10:04,380 --> 00:10:08,860
I'll start by reviewing the exponent rules.

115
00:10:08,860 --> 00:10:14,860
The product rule says that when you multiply two expressions with the same base, you add

116
00:10:14,860 --> 00:10:16,660
the exponents.

117
00:10:16,660 --> 00:10:22,220
The quotient rule says that when you divide two expressions with the same base, you subtract

118
00:10:22,220 --> 00:10:23,740
the exponents.

119
00:10:23,740 --> 00:10:31,340
The power rule says that when you take a power to a power, you multiply the exponents.

120
00:10:31,340 --> 00:10:37,540
The power of zero rule says that anything to the zero power is one as long as the base

121
00:10:37,540 --> 00:10:40,020
is not zero.

122
00:10:40,020 --> 00:10:45,300
Since zero to the zero is undefined, it doesn't make sense.

123
00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:51,780
With exponents, to evaluate x to the minus n, we take the reciprocal one over x to the

124
00:10:51,780 --> 00:10:53,420
n.

125
00:10:53,420 --> 00:10:59,460
To evaluate a fractional exponent, like x to the one over n, we take the nth root of

126
00:10:59,460 --> 00:11:01,720
x.

127
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:09,140
We can distribute an exponent over a product, a times b to the n is equal to a to the n times

128
00:11:09,140 --> 00:11:14,420
b to the n, and we can distribute an exponent over a quotient.

129
00:11:14,420 --> 00:11:20,140
A over b to the n is a to the n over b to the n.

130
00:11:20,140 --> 00:11:26,580
In the rest of this video, we'll use these exponent rules to simplify expressions.

131
00:11:26,580 --> 00:11:32,220
For our first example, we want to simplify 3 times x to the minus 2 divided by x to the

132
00:11:32,220 --> 00:11:33,220
fourth.

133
00:11:33,220 --> 00:11:36,460
There are several possible ways to proceed.

134
00:11:36,460 --> 00:11:43,180
For example, we could use the negative exponent rule to write x to the minus 2 as one over

135
00:11:43,180 --> 00:11:44,900
x squared.

136
00:11:44,900 --> 00:11:49,260
All that gets divided by x to the fourth still.

137
00:11:49,260 --> 00:11:52,500
Notice that we only take the reciprocal of the x squared.

138
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:57,260
The 3 stays where it is, and that's because the exponent of negative 2 only applies to

139
00:11:57,260 --> 00:12:00,820
the x, not to the 3.

140
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:09,260
Now if we think of 3 as 3 over 1, we have a product of two fractions in our numerator,

141
00:12:09,260 --> 00:12:15,220
and so we evaluate that by taking the product of the numerators times the product of the

142
00:12:15,220 --> 00:12:22,140
denominators, which is 3 over x squared all divided by x to the fourth.

143
00:12:22,140 --> 00:12:29,180
I can think of x to the fourth as x to the fourth over 1, so now I have a fraction over

144
00:12:29,180 --> 00:12:35,500
a fraction, which I can evaluate by multiplying by the reciprocal.

145
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:42,620
That simplifies to 3 times 1 divided by x squared times x to the fourth, which is 3

146
00:12:42,620 --> 00:12:49,900
over x to the sixth using the product rule, since x squared times x to the fourth is equal

147
00:12:49,900 --> 00:12:55,460
to x to the 2 plus 4, or x to the sixth.

148
00:12:55,460 --> 00:13:04,140
An alternate way of solving this problem is to start by using the quotient rule.

149
00:13:04,140 --> 00:13:10,020
I can rewrite this as 3 times x to the minus 2 over x to the fourth, and by the quotient

150
00:13:10,020 --> 00:13:18,820
rule that's 3 times x to the minus 2 minus 4, or 3 times x to the minus 6.

151
00:13:18,820 --> 00:13:25,300
Now using the negative exponent rule, x to the minus 6 is 1 over x to the sixth, and

152
00:13:25,300 --> 00:13:30,940
this product of fractions simplifies to 3 over x to the sixth.

153
00:13:30,940 --> 00:13:34,140
The same answer I got before.

154
00:13:34,140 --> 00:13:37,820
The second problem can be solved in similar ways.

155
00:13:37,820 --> 00:13:42,420
Please pause the video and try it before going on.

156
00:13:42,420 --> 00:13:49,020
One way to simplify would be to use the negative exponent rule first and rewrite y to the minus

157
00:13:49,020 --> 00:13:53,420
5 as 1 over y to the fifth.

158
00:13:53,420 --> 00:14:03,980
Using of this as a fraction divided by a fraction, I can multiply by the reciprocal

159
00:14:03,980 --> 00:14:11,260
and get 4y cubed y to the fifth over 1 by the product rule.

160
00:14:11,260 --> 00:14:19,380
The numerator here is 4y to the eighth, and so my final answer is just 4y to the eighth.

161
00:14:20,020 --> 00:14:25,620
Alternatively, I could decide to use the quotient rule first.

162
00:14:25,620 --> 00:14:33,060
As in the previous problem, I can write this as 4y cubed minus negative 5 by the quotient

163
00:14:33,060 --> 00:14:38,020
rule, and so that's 4y to the eighth as before.

164
00:14:38,020 --> 00:14:43,780
I'd like to show you one more method to solve these two problems, kind of a shortcut method

165
00:14:43,780 --> 00:14:45,660
before we go on.

166
00:14:45,660 --> 00:14:52,740
A shortcut relies on the principle that a negative exponent in the numerator corresponds

167
00:14:52,740 --> 00:14:56,540
to a positive exponent in the denominator.

168
00:14:56,540 --> 00:15:03,420
For example, the x to the negative 2 in the numerator here after some manipulations became

169
00:15:03,420 --> 00:15:07,060
an x to the positive 2 in the denominator.

170
00:15:07,900 --> 00:15:15,820
Furthermore, a negative exponent in the denominator is equivalent to a positive exponent in the

171
00:15:15,820 --> 00:15:19,140
numerator.

172
00:15:19,140 --> 00:15:24,020
That's what happened when we had the y to the negative 5 in the denominator and translated

173
00:15:24,020 --> 00:15:28,540
into a y to the positive 5 in the numerator.

174
00:15:28,540 --> 00:15:36,740
Sometimes people like to talk about this principle by saying that you can pass a factor across

175
00:15:37,340 --> 00:15:47,460
the fraction bar by switching the sign of the exponent, that is, making a positive exponent

176
00:15:47,460 --> 00:15:51,900
negative or a negative exponent positive.

177
00:15:51,900 --> 00:15:57,500
Let's see how this principle gives us a shortcut for solving these two problems.

178
00:15:57,500 --> 00:16:05,020
In the first problem, 3x to the minus 2 over x to the 4, we can move the negative exponent

179
00:16:05,020 --> 00:16:09,340
in the numerator and make it a positive exponent in the denominator.

180
00:16:09,340 --> 00:16:16,940
So we get 3 over x to the 4 plus 2 or x to the 6.

181
00:16:16,940 --> 00:16:24,420
In the second example, for y cubed over y to the minus 5, we can change the y to the

182
00:16:24,420 --> 00:16:30,780
minus 5 in the denominator into a y to the 5 in the numerator and get our final answer

183
00:16:30,780 --> 00:16:36,460
of 4 y to the 3 plus 5 or 8.

184
00:16:36,460 --> 00:16:40,820
We'll use this principle again in the next problems.

185
00:16:40,820 --> 00:16:46,380
In this example, notice that I have y's in the numerator and in the denominator and also

186
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:49,940
z's in the numerator and in the denominator.

187
00:16:49,940 --> 00:16:53,580
In order to simplify it, I'm going to try to get all my y's either in the numerator

188
00:16:53,580 --> 00:16:57,660
or the denominator and similarly for the z's.

189
00:16:57,660 --> 00:17:03,900
Since I have more y's in the denominator, let me move this y to the 3 downstairs and

190
00:17:03,900 --> 00:17:06,380
make it a y to the negative 3.

191
00:17:06,380 --> 00:17:13,900
I'm using the principle here that a positive exponent in the numerator corresponds to a

192
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:17,420
negative exponent in the denominator.

193
00:17:17,420 --> 00:17:21,340
Now since I have a positive exponent on z in the numerator and a negative exponent in

194
00:17:21,340 --> 00:17:28,100
the denominator and I want to get rid of negative exponents, I'm going to pass the z's to the

195
00:17:28,100 --> 00:17:29,100
numerator.

196
00:17:29,100 --> 00:17:37,860
A z to the minus 2 in the denominator becomes a z to the plus 2 in the numerator.

197
00:17:37,860 --> 00:17:42,660
Notice that my number 7 doesn't move when I do any of these manipulations because it

198
00:17:42,660 --> 00:17:47,620
doesn't have an exponent and the exponent of negative 2, for example, only applies to

199
00:17:47,620 --> 00:17:50,380
the z, not to the 7.

200
00:17:50,380 --> 00:17:54,940
Now that I've got all my z's in the numerator and all my y's in the denominator, it's easy

201
00:17:54,940 --> 00:18:01,660
to clean this up using the product rule and I have my simplified expression.

202
00:18:01,660 --> 00:18:07,340
In this last example, we have a complicated expression raised to a fractional power.

203
00:18:07,340 --> 00:18:12,460
I'm going to start by simplifying the expression inside the parentheses.

204
00:18:12,460 --> 00:18:18,060
I can bring all my y's downstairs and all my x's upstairs and get rid of negative exponents

205
00:18:18,060 --> 00:18:19,060
at the same time.

206
00:18:19,060 --> 00:18:26,740
In other words, I can rewrite this as 25x to the fourth.

207
00:18:26,740 --> 00:18:32,940
I'll bring the y to the minus 5 downstairs and make it y to the fifth on the denominator.

208
00:18:32,940 --> 00:18:39,060
Bring the x to the minus 6 upstairs and make it x to the sixth, the numerator, and then

209
00:18:39,060 --> 00:18:43,020
I still have the y cubed on the denominator.

210
00:18:43,020 --> 00:18:46,240
All that's raised to the 3 half's power.

211
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:50,720
Using the product rule, I can rewrite the expression on the inside of the parentheses

212
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:57,080
as 25x to the tenth over y to the eighth.

213
00:18:57,080 --> 00:19:08,680
Recall that we're allowed to distribute an exponent across a product or across a quotient.

214
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:17,480
When I distribute my 3 half's power, I get 25 to the 3 half's times x to the tenth to

215
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:24,120
the 3 half's divided by y to the eighth to the 3 half's.

216
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:31,000
Now the power rule tells me when I have a power to a power, I get to multiply the exponents.

217
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:38,120
So I can rewrite this as 25 to the 3 half's times x to the tenth times 3 half's over y

218
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:40,800
to the eighth times 3 half's.

219
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:47,600
In other words, 25 to the 3 half's times x to the fifteenth over y to the twelfth.

220
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:53,120
Finally, I need to rewrite 25 to the 3 half's.

221
00:19:53,120 --> 00:20:02,440
As 3 half's can be thought of as 3 times 1 half or as 1 half times 3, I can write 25

222
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:11,520
to the 3 half's as 25 to the 3 times 1 half or as 25 to the 1 half times 3.

223
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:17,680
Well using the power rule in reverse, I can think of this as 25 cubed to the 1 half or

224
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:26,520
as 25 to the 1 half cubed since when I take a power to a power, I multiply the exponents.

225
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:34,040
25 cubed to the 1 half might be hard to evaluate since 25 cubed is a huge number.

226
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:39,440
But 25 to the 1 half is just the square root of 25.

227
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:45,720
So I have the square root of 25 cubed or 5 cubed which is 125.

228
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:55,840
Therefore, my original expression is going to be 125 x to the 15 over y to the twelfth.

229
00:20:55,840 --> 00:21:02,560
In this video, we use the exponent rules to simplify complicated expressions.

230
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:07,800
This video goes through a few tricks for simplifying expressions with radicals in them.

231
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:14,720
Recall that this notation means the nth root of x, so this notation here means the cube

232
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:22,440
root of 8, the number that when you cube it, you get 8, that number would be 2.

233
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:28,120
When we write the root sign without a little number, that just means the square root, so

234
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:31,320
the 2 is implied.

235
00:21:31,320 --> 00:21:38,640
In this case, the square root of 25 is 5 since 5 squared is 25.

236
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:42,080
Let's start by reviewing some rules for radical expressions.

237
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:51,720
First, if we have the radical of a product, we can rewrite that as the product of two radicals.

238
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:59,840
For example, the square root of 9 times 16 is the same thing as a square root of 9 times

239
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:01,880
the square root of 16.

240
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:05,800
You can check that both of these evaluate to 12.

241
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:11,880
Similarly, it's possible to distribute a radical sign across division.

242
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:18,560
The radical of a divided by b is the same thing as the radical of a divided by the radical

243
00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:20,280
of b.

244
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:28,880
For example, the cube root of 64 over 8 is the same thing as the cube root of 64 over

245
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:30,800
the cube root of 8.

246
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:34,160
And you can check that both of these evaluate to 2.

247
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:40,760
You have to be a little bit careful though because it's not okay to distribute a radical

248
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:43,120
sign across addition.

249
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:49,600
In general, the nth root of a plus b is not equal to the nth root of a plus the nth root

250
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:50,760
of b.

251
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:58,240
And similarly, it's not okay to distribute a radical across subtraction.

252
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:01,520
If you're ever in doubt, you can always check with simple examples.

253
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:08,320
For example, the square root of 1 plus 1 is not the same thing as a square root of 1 plus

254
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:10,560
a square root of 1.

255
00:23:10,560 --> 00:23:16,120
The right side evaluates to 1 plus 1 or 2, and the left side is square root of 2, an

256
00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:18,760
irrational number.

257
00:23:18,760 --> 00:23:24,000
The second expression to show that that fails, I don't think it'll work to use the square

258
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:27,560
root of 1 minus 1, it'll actually hold in that case.

259
00:23:27,560 --> 00:23:32,640
But I can show it's false by using say the square root of 2 minus 1, which does not equal

260
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:37,160
the square root of 2 minus the square root of 1.

261
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:41,320
You might notice that these rules for radicals, the ones that hold and the ones that don't

262
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:45,360
hold, remind you of rules for exponents.

263
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:50,560
And that's no coincidence because radicals can be written in terms of exponents.

264
00:23:50,560 --> 00:23:55,200
For example, if we look at the first rule, we could rewrite this.

265
00:23:55,200 --> 00:24:02,040
The nth root of a times b is the same thing as the 1 over nth power.

266
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:08,160
And by exponent rules, I can distribute an exponent across multiplication.

267
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:15,640
And so this radical rule can be restated completely in terms of an exponent rule.

268
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:22,640
Similarly, the second rule can be restated in terms of exponents as a over b to the 1

269
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:28,920
over n is equal to a to the 1 over n divided by b to the 1 over n.

270
00:24:28,920 --> 00:24:35,920
We can use the relationship between radicals and exponents to rewrite a to the m over n.

271
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:42,680
a to the m over n is the same thing as a to the m with the nth root taken.

272
00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:48,720
It's also the same thing as the nth root of a all taken to the nth power.

273
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:52,320
To see why that's true, think about exponent rules.

274
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:58,800
So a to the m over n is the same thing as a to the m taken to the 1 over nth power.

275
00:24:58,800 --> 00:25:03,000
That's because when we take a power to a power, we multiply exponents.

276
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:09,640
And m times 1 over n is equal to m over n.

277
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:13,080
But a 1 over nth power is the same thing as an nth root.

278
00:25:13,080 --> 00:25:19,400
And therefore, this expression is the same thing as this expression.

279
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:22,560
And that proves the first equivalence.

280
00:25:22,560 --> 00:25:31,240
The second equivalence can be proved similarly by writing a to the m over n as a to the 1

281
00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:33,440
over n times m.

282
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:39,280
Again, this is worked because when I take the power to the power, I multiply exponents

283
00:25:39,280 --> 00:25:43,800
1 over n times m is the same thing as m over n.

284
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:50,080
But now these two expressions are the same because the 1 over nth power is the same as

285
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:52,040
the nth root.

286
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:57,720
One mnemonic for remembering these relationships is flower over root.

287
00:25:57,720 --> 00:26:01,200
So flower is like power and root is like root.

288
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:04,240
So that tells us we can write a fractional exponent.

289
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:10,360
The m becomes the power and the n becomes the root in either of these two orders.

290
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:13,280
Now let's use these rules in some examples.

291
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:20,640
If we want to compute 25 to the negative three-halves power, well, first I'll use my exponent rule

292
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:27,400
to rewrite that negative exponent as 1 over 25 to the three-halves power.

293
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:37,640
Next, I'll use the power over root mnemonic to rewrite this as 25 to the third power square-rooted

294
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:43,760
or as 25 square-rooted to the third power.

295
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:48,760
I wrote the twos there for the square root for emphasis, but most of the time people

296
00:26:48,760 --> 00:26:55,240
will omit this and just write the square root without a little number there.

297
00:26:55,240 --> 00:26:59,680
Now I could use either of these two equivalent expressions to continue, but I'd rather

298
00:26:59,680 --> 00:27:03,160
use this one because it's easier to compute without a calculator.

299
00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:05,880
The square root of 25 is just five.

300
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:12,680
Five cubed is 125, so my answer is 1 over 125.

301
00:27:12,680 --> 00:27:17,680
If I tried to compute the cube of 25 first, I'd get a huge number.

302
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:22,480
In general, it's usually easier to compute the root before the power when you're working

303
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:25,960
without a calculator.

304
00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:31,480
Now let's do an example simplifying a more complicated expression with exponents in it.

305
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:36,920
I want to take the square root of all this stuff, and since I don't really like negative

306
00:27:36,920 --> 00:27:42,640
exponents, I'm first going to rewrite this as the square root of 60x squared y to the

307
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:48,400
sixth over z to the 11th, so I'll change that negative exponent to a positive exponent

308
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:52,880
by moving this factor to the denominator.

309
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:57,520
Now when you're asked to simplify a radical expression, that generally means to pull as

310
00:27:57,520 --> 00:28:02,040
much as possible out of the radical sign.

311
00:28:02,040 --> 00:28:07,040
To pull things out of the square root sign, I'm going to factor my numbers and try to

312
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:12,480
rewrite everything in terms of squares as much as possible since the square root of

313
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:15,840
a square, those two operations undo each other.

314
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:17,760
So I'll show you what I mean.

315
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:26,640
First, I'll factor 60, so 60 is going to be 2 squared times 3 times 5, and I'll just

316
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:31,360
copy everything over for now.

317
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:36,600
Now I'll break things up into squares as much as possible, so I've got a 2 squared times

318
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:40,960
3 times 5, I've already got an x squared, I'll write the y to the sixth as y squared

319
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:46,640
times y squared times y squared, and I'll write the z to the 11th as z squared times

320
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:53,720
z squared, I guess 5 times 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 times 1 extra z.

321
00:28:53,720 --> 00:28:59,520
That should add up to z to the 11th if I add all those exponents together.

322
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:04,360
Now I know that I can distribute my radical sign across multiplication and division, so

323
00:29:04,360 --> 00:29:09,960
I'll write this with a zillion different radicals here.

324
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:16,560
Every time I see the square root of something squared, I can just cancel those square roots

325
00:29:16,560 --> 00:29:19,840
and the squares out and get what's left here.

326
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:27,360
So after doing that cancellation, I get 2 times the square root of 3 times 5 times x times

327
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:36,920
y times y times y over z times itself, I guess 5 times, times the square root of z.

328
00:29:36,920 --> 00:29:42,240
Now I can clean that up with exponents, I'll write that as the square root of 15, I guess

329
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:51,240
2 times the square root of 15 times x times y cubed over z to the fifth, the square root

330
00:29:51,240 --> 00:29:52,240
of z.

331
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:58,920
I'm going to leave this example as is, but sometimes people prefer to rewrite radical

332
00:29:58,920 --> 00:30:04,880
expressions without radical signs in the denominator, that's called rationalizing the denominator.

333
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:09,000
I won't do it here, but I'll show you how to do it in the next example.

334
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:12,280
This example asks us to rationalize the denominator.

335
00:30:12,280 --> 00:30:20,640
That means to rewrite as an equivalent expression without radical signs in the denominator.

336
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:28,040
To get rid of the radical sign in the denominator, I want to multiply my denominator by square

337
00:30:28,040 --> 00:30:32,800
root of x, but I can't just multiply the denominator willy-nilly by something unless

338
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:37,400
I multiply the numerator by the same thing, so that I'm just multiplying my expression

339
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:42,840
by 1 in a fancy form and I don't change the value of my expression.

340
00:30:42,840 --> 00:30:50,400
Now if I just multiply together numerators, 3x squared of x, and multiply denominators,

341
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:55,280
square root of x times square root of x is the square root of x squared, square root

342
00:30:55,280 --> 00:30:58,280
of x squared is just x.

343
00:30:58,280 --> 00:31:04,120
Now I can cancel my x's from the numerator and denominator and my final answer is 3 times

344
00:31:04,120 --> 00:31:05,440
the square root of x.

345
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:11,920
I rationalize my denominator and the process got a nicer looking expression.

346
00:31:11,920 --> 00:31:18,160
In this video, we went over the rules for radicals and we simplified some radical expressions

347
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:26,640
by working with fractional exponents, pulling things out of the radical sign, and rationalizing

348
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:29,760
the denominator.

349
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:32,120
Hi class, happy snow day.

350
00:31:32,120 --> 00:31:36,400
Since class is canceled, I'm putting together this video with some additional examples on

351
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:39,200
simplifying radicals that I would have done in class.

352
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:43,880
I hope this will help you complete your assignment that's due tonight.

353
00:31:43,880 --> 00:31:48,320
Let's start with this example, asking us to simplify the product of two radicals.

354
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:53,000
I could simplify each radical separately and then multiply things together, but I think

355
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:57,200
it'll save me trouble if I multiply first and then simplify.

356
00:31:57,200 --> 00:32:06,960
So I'm going to multiply these together since the product of two radicals is the radical

357
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:11,280
of the product, assuming everything's positive.

358
00:32:11,280 --> 00:32:17,200
I can rewrite my expression as the square root of, let's see, 5 times 15, that's going

359
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:25,200
to be 75, x times x cubed, that's x to the fourth because when I multiply two expressions,

360
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:31,160
I add the exponents and y to the seventh times y cubed, that's going to be y to the tenth

361
00:32:31,160 --> 00:32:33,960
since seven plus three is ten.

362
00:32:33,960 --> 00:32:38,280
Now I want to simplify by pulling as much out of the square root sign as I can.

363
00:32:38,280 --> 00:32:41,720
If 75 were a perfect square, I could just take the square root of it, but since it's

364
00:32:41,720 --> 00:32:48,440
not, I'm going to factor it, so 75, let's see, that's 25 times three and 25 is five

365
00:32:48,440 --> 00:32:53,240
times five, so I can write that as five squared times three.

366
00:32:53,240 --> 00:32:58,720
Now I can write my square root, let's see, so that's five squared times three times x

367
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:01,440
to the fourth times y to the tenth.

368
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:07,920
Now since I know that the square root of anything squared is just that original thing, assuming

369
00:33:07,920 --> 00:33:14,880
that the variables are positive, I can maybe rewrite this as by breaking everything up

370
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:16,620
into a bunch of squares.

371
00:33:16,620 --> 00:33:20,400
So let's see, I already have a square here, there's no hope for the three, the x to the

372
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:24,920
fourth I can write that as x squared times x squared, right, that makes four x's and

373
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:31,320
y to the tenth, I'm going to need five y squareds to get ten y's out of that, one,

374
00:33:31,320 --> 00:33:34,480
two, three, y squared, y squared.

375
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:40,680
Now splitting up the square root back into a product of a bunch of square roots, every

376
00:33:40,680 --> 00:33:44,560
time I see the square root of something squared I just replace it with a thing, so that's

377
00:33:44,560 --> 00:33:52,040
five, I still have the square root of three, that gives me x, x, y, y, y, y, y, and I can

378
00:33:52,040 --> 00:33:57,360
rewrite that as five, square root of three times x squared, y to the fifth, so that's

379
00:33:57,360 --> 00:34:00,680
one way to simplify this expression.

380
00:34:00,680 --> 00:34:06,840
Alternatively, I could complete this problem a little bit faster the following way, I could

381
00:34:06,840 --> 00:34:12,800
go ahead and break up my five squared times three times x to the fourth times y to the

382
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:20,520
tenth, I'm going to break that up, go ahead and break that up as a product of square roots.

383
00:34:20,520 --> 00:34:25,920
Now the square root of five squared is certainly five, square root of three stays the same,

384
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:29,800
square root of x to the fourth is going to be x squared, there are a couple ways to

385
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:35,360
see that, one way is the square root of x fourth, that's x to the fourth to the one

386
00:34:35,360 --> 00:34:40,720
half power, since square roots are the same as half powers, and now I can multiply my

387
00:34:40,720 --> 00:34:46,160
exponents to get my x squared, or alternatively I can think of that because the square root

388
00:34:46,160 --> 00:34:50,640
of x to the fourth, that's the square root of x squared squared, since I take a power

389
00:34:50,640 --> 00:34:55,040
to a power I multiply my exponents, square root of something squared is just a thing,

390
00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:59,800
so that's x squared. Similarly the square root of y to the tenth, that's going to be

391
00:34:59,800 --> 00:35:04,320
y to the fifth, notice I'm just taking half of the exponent, and you can see that the

392
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:12,320
same way, that's because if I do the square root of y to the tenth, that's the same thing

393
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:19,480
as y to the tenth to the one half, which is y to the tenth times one half, or y to the

394
00:35:19,480 --> 00:35:24,920
fifth, or alternatively you can think of this as the square root of y to the tenth is the

395
00:35:24,920 --> 00:35:31,240
square root of y to the fifth squared, which is y to the fifth. So if it weren't for all

396
00:35:31,240 --> 00:35:35,200
that little side work I did, that would have, this would have been a faster way to get to

397
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:40,240
the same answer as before.

398
00:35:40,240 --> 00:35:45,480
The next few examples have to do with rewriting expressions by rationalizing denominators.

399
00:35:45,480 --> 00:35:50,000
Please pause the video for a moment and see if you can decide if these two expressions

400
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:56,720
represent the same thing or different things. In fact, they represent the same thing, and

401
00:35:56,720 --> 00:36:03,120
we can see that, that we can transform a to look like b by doing something called rationalizing

402
00:36:03,120 --> 00:36:06,960
denominator, trying to get all the square roots out of the denominator at the expense

403
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:10,760
of maybe putting some more squares in the numerator. So to rationalize the denominator

404
00:36:10,760 --> 00:36:16,200
in this case, since there's just that one, that one piece with square roots in it, I'm

405
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:21,440
going to multiply both the top and the bottom by the square root of y, the thing that has

406
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:27,320
the square root around it. If I multiply the bottom by the square root of y, I have to

407
00:36:27,320 --> 00:36:31,120
multiply the top also so I won't change the value of my expression. This way I'm just

408
00:36:31,120 --> 00:36:38,800
multiplying by one in a fancy form. Now when I multiply fractions I multiply the numerator,

409
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:42,440
and I multiply the denominator. Well let's see, the square root of y times the square

410
00:36:42,440 --> 00:36:53,120
root of y, that's the square root of y squared, which is the same thing as just y. So I can

411
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:58,520
bring my square roots together and get three square root of xy over five y, which is exactly

412
00:36:58,520 --> 00:37:04,760
the second expression. Here are two even crazier expressions, the last one's especially crazy.

413
00:37:04,760 --> 00:37:10,960
Again, try to decide if these two represent the same thing or represent a different thing.

414
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:16,400
Kind of surprisingly, they actually represent the same thing still. And we can transform

415
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:22,280
one to two by again rationalizing the denominator, this time we're going to use something called

416
00:37:22,280 --> 00:37:27,320
the conjugate. And that's because we have a difference in this case of two expressions,

417
00:37:27,320 --> 00:37:33,120
one of which has a square root in it. So when I have the difference of two expressions,

418
00:37:33,120 --> 00:37:40,000
one of which with a square root in it, I find the conjugate by taking the sum of those two

419
00:37:40,040 --> 00:37:45,840
expressions. If instead I had had the sum of two expressions, then the conjugate would

420
00:37:45,840 --> 00:37:54,040
be the difference. Okay, so I'm going to multiply the top and the bottom by this conjugate of

421
00:37:54,040 --> 00:38:00,760
the denominator. So let me move down here and rewrite with more space. Once again, I have

422
00:38:00,760 --> 00:38:04,920
to multiply the numerator and the denominator by the same thing so that I'm not changing

423
00:38:04,920 --> 00:38:09,120
the value of my expression, I'm just multiplying by one in a fancy form. Now let's look at

424
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:13,560
what happens in the denominator first, I have to multiply three by three, three by the

425
00:38:13,560 --> 00:38:18,200
square root of a, negative square root of a by three, and negative square root of a by

426
00:38:18,200 --> 00:38:23,200
square root of a. So that's going to give me three times three is nine plus three square

427
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:31,800
root of a minus three square root of a minus square root of a squared. So in a moment that

428
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:38,360
I'll simplify to these things cancel. So that'll be nine minus square root of a squared is

429
00:38:38,360 --> 00:38:42,960
a. Notice how I've gotten rid of the square roots of the denominator, which is why it's

430
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:49,360
called rationalized denominator. We get rid of the, I don't know, irrational numbers,

431
00:38:49,360 --> 00:38:52,900
the radical signs. Okay, let's look at the numerator. So again, we have to, we're going

432
00:38:52,900 --> 00:38:57,480
to have four terms, this times this, this times that, b times three, b times square

433
00:38:57,480 --> 00:39:08,200
root of a. That gives us 15 a plus five a square root of a plus three b plus b square

434
00:39:08,200 --> 00:39:15,040
root of a. Now that's starting to look similar to this expression here. And in fact, it we

435
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:19,760
can see that it's exactly the same thing by turning our radicals into exponents. So let's

436
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:26,440
see, we still have the 15 a. This is the same thing as five a times a to the one half, we

437
00:39:26,440 --> 00:39:33,880
still got the three b. And we've got b times a to the one half. And now let's see a times

438
00:39:33,880 --> 00:39:39,880
a to the one half here, that's really, I can add my exponents. So that's going to be five

439
00:39:39,880 --> 00:39:47,080
a to the one plus one half is three halves, three b, b, a to the one half. And that's

440
00:39:47,080 --> 00:39:53,520
exactly what I have in this expression, just in a slightly different order. So these really

441
00:39:53,520 --> 00:40:00,800
are the same, kind of weird. Please pause the video and try your hand at rationalizing

442
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:07,400
the denominator of this expression. Since we have a sum of two expressions in the denominator,

443
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:13,160
we want to multiply the numerator and denominator by the conjugate of the denominator. So that's

444
00:40:13,160 --> 00:40:19,640
squared of a minus one. Now when we multiply out the numerator, we'll get four terms,

445
00:40:19,640 --> 00:40:29,280
squared of a squared. Let's see minus the square of a. And now we have seven times

446
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:38,040
the square of a. And finally, seven times minus one, that's minus seven. On the denominator,

447
00:40:38,040 --> 00:40:44,480
we get the square of a squared minus the square of a plus the square of a minus one. Notice

448
00:40:44,560 --> 00:40:50,640
how the square root things cancel, just like before, that's the whole magic of using the

449
00:40:50,640 --> 00:40:55,240
conjugate, it makes those square roots cancel out. So now on the numerator, squared of

450
00:40:55,240 --> 00:41:00,640
a squared is a minus the square of a plus seven squared of a, that's a net of six square

451
00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:07,760
of a minus seven. And then on the denominator, we have a minus one, we've gotten rid of the

452
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:12,400
square roots on the denominator, rationalize the denominator, I'm happy leaving the square

453
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:16,960
root in the numerator, but if you want to, you can change it to a exponent instead, it's really

454
00:41:16,960 --> 00:41:22,320
up to you. That's all the examples I have today, I hope you enjoy the snow, which hasn't started

455
00:41:22,320 --> 00:41:28,040
yet for me. And please do spend some time to finish your Alex objective if you haven't done it

456
00:41:28,040 --> 00:41:36,040
already. Goodbye. This video goes over some common methods of factoring. Recall that factoring an

457
00:41:36,040 --> 00:41:42,280
expression means to write it as a product. So we could factor the number 30 by writing it as six

458
00:41:42,320 --> 00:41:50,040
times five, or we could factor it more completely by writing it as two times three times five. As

459
00:41:50,040 --> 00:41:58,120
another example, we could factor the expression x squared plus five x plus six, by writing it as x

460
00:41:58,120 --> 00:42:06,840
plus two times x plus three. In this video, I'll go over how I get from here to here, how I know how

461
00:42:06,840 --> 00:42:13,280
to do the factoring. But for right now, I just want to review how I can go backwards, how I can

462
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:19,200
check that the factoring is correct. And that's just by multiplying out or distributing. If I

463
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:25,920
distribute x plus two times x plus three, then I multiply x by x that gives me x squared, x times

464
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:32,920
three gives me three x, two times x gives me two x and two times three gives me six. So that

465
00:42:32,920 --> 00:42:39,520
simplifies to x squared plus five x plus six, which checks out with what I started with. So you can

466
00:42:39,520 --> 00:42:45,720
think of factoring as the opposite of distributing out. And you can always check your factoring by

467
00:42:45,720 --> 00:42:52,640
distributing or multiplying out. A bit of terminology, when I think of an expression as a sum of a

468
00:42:52,640 --> 00:42:58,880
bunch of things, then the things I sum up are called the terms. But if I think of the same

469
00:42:58,880 --> 00:43:05,520
expression as a product of things, then the things that I multiply together are called

470
00:43:05,520 --> 00:43:13,440
factors. Now let's get started on techniques of factoring. When I have to factor something, I

471
00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:19,120
always like to start by pulling out the greatest common factor. The greatest common factor means

472
00:43:19,120 --> 00:43:26,240
the largest thing that divides each of the terms. In this first example, the largest thing that

473
00:43:26,240 --> 00:43:38,200
divides both 15 and 25x is five. So the GCF is five. So I pull the five out, and then I divide each

474
00:43:38,200 --> 00:43:47,280
of the terms by that number. And so I get three plus five x. Pause the video for a moment and see

475
00:43:47,280 --> 00:43:54,440
if you can find the greatest common factor of x squared y and y squared x cubed. The biggest

476
00:43:54,480 --> 00:44:03,560
thing that divides both x squared y and y squared x cubed is going to be x squared times y. One way

477
00:44:03,560 --> 00:44:09,880
to find this is to look for the power of x that's smallest in each of these terms. So that's x

478
00:44:09,880 --> 00:44:17,080
squared. And the power of y that's smallest in each of these terms is just y to the one or y. Now

479
00:44:17,080 --> 00:44:24,680
if I factor out the x squared y from each of the terms, that's like dividing each term by x squared

480
00:44:24,680 --> 00:44:30,680
y. If I divide the first term by x squared y, I just get one. If I divide the second term by x

481
00:44:30,680 --> 00:44:37,880
squared y, I'm going to be left with an x and a y. I'll write this out on the side just to make it

482
00:44:37,880 --> 00:44:47,320
more clear y squared x cubed over x squared y. That's like two y's on and three x's on the top and

483
00:44:47,320 --> 00:44:56,200
two x's and a y on the bottom. So I'm left with just an x and a y. So I'll write the x y here,

484
00:44:56,200 --> 00:45:04,280
and I factored my expression. As always, I can check my answer by multiplying out. So if I multiply

485
00:45:04,280 --> 00:45:11,720
out my factored expression, I get x squared y is the first term and the second term. I get x,

486
00:45:11,720 --> 00:45:16,680
there now let's see three x's multiplied together and two y's multiplied together,

487
00:45:16,680 --> 00:45:23,400
and that checks out with what I started with. The next technique of factoring I'd like to go over

488
00:45:23,400 --> 00:45:29,880
is factoring by grouping. In this example, notice that we have four terms factoring by grouping

489
00:45:29,880 --> 00:45:35,560
is a handy method to look at if you have four terms in your expression you need to factor.

490
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:41,720
In order to factor by grouping, I'm first going to factor out the greatest common factor of the

491
00:45:41,720 --> 00:45:47,000
first two terms, and then separately factor out the greatest common factor of the last two terms.

492
00:45:47,880 --> 00:45:55,000
The greatest common factor of x cubed and three x squared is x squared. So I factor out the x

493
00:45:55,000 --> 00:46:02,600
squared and I get x plus three. And now the greatest common factor of four x and 12 is just four.

494
00:46:03,320 --> 00:46:12,760
So I factor out the four from those two terms. Notice that the factor of x plus three now appears

495
00:46:12,760 --> 00:46:19,880
in both pieces. So I can factor out the greatest common factor of x plus three, I think I'll factor

496
00:46:19,880 --> 00:46:27,000
it out on the left side instead of the right. And now I have an x squared from this first piece,

497
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:35,480
and I have a four from this second piece, and that completes my factoring by grouping.

498
00:46:36,520 --> 00:46:41,640
You might wonder if we could factor further by factoring the expression x squared plus four.

499
00:46:41,640 --> 00:46:47,480
But in fact, as we'll see later, this expression, which is a sum of two squares, x squared plus

500
00:46:47,480 --> 00:46:54,440
two squared does not factor any further over the integers. Next, we'll do some factoring of

501
00:46:54,440 --> 00:47:02,200
quadratics. A quadratic is an expression with a squared term, just a term with x in it, and a

502
00:47:02,200 --> 00:47:12,200
constant term with no x's in it. I'd like to factor this expression as a product of x plus or minus

503
00:47:12,200 --> 00:47:19,720
some number times x plus or minus some other number. The key idea is that if I can find those

504
00:47:19,720 --> 00:47:24,440
two numbers, then if I were to distribute out this expression, those two numbers would have to

505
00:47:24,440 --> 00:47:31,960
multiply to give me my constant term of eight. And these two numbers would end up having to add

506
00:47:31,960 --> 00:47:38,040
to give me my negative six, because when I multiply out, this number will be a coefficient of x and

507
00:47:38,040 --> 00:47:42,280
this number will be also another coefficient of x, they'll add together to the negative six.

508
00:47:44,600 --> 00:47:48,840
So if I look at all the pairs of numbers that multiply together to give me eight,

509
00:47:49,480 --> 00:47:56,760
so that could be one and eight, two and four, four and two, but that's really the same thing

510
00:47:56,760 --> 00:48:01,720
as I had before. And that's sort of the same thing I had before. I shouldn't forget the negatives,

511
00:48:01,720 --> 00:48:06,200
I could have negative one, negative eight, or I could have negative two, negative four, those

512
00:48:06,200 --> 00:48:12,280
also multiply together to give me eight. Now I just have to find, see if there's a pair of these

513
00:48:12,280 --> 00:48:20,280
numbers that add to negative six. And it's not hard to see that these ones will work. So now I can

514
00:48:20,280 --> 00:48:29,160
write out my factoring as that would be x minus two times x minus four. And it's always a good idea

515
00:48:29,240 --> 00:48:36,520
to check by multiplying out, I'm going to get x squared minus four x minus two x plus eight.

516
00:48:36,520 --> 00:48:43,080
And that works out to just what I want. Now the second example is a bit more complicated because

517
00:48:43,080 --> 00:48:49,320
now my leading coefficient, my coefficient of x squared is not just one, it's the number 10.

518
00:48:50,680 --> 00:48:54,040
Now there are lots of different methods for approaching a problem like this. And I'm just

519
00:48:54,040 --> 00:48:59,720
going to show you one method, my favorite method that uses factoring by grouping. But to start out,

520
00:48:59,720 --> 00:49:05,880
I'm going to multiply my coefficient of x squared by my constant term. So I'm multiplying 10 by negative

521
00:49:05,880 --> 00:49:13,080
six. That gives me negative 60. And I'll also take my coefficient of x, so you'll number 11,

522
00:49:13,720 --> 00:49:19,560
and write that down here. Now I'm going to look for two numbers that multiply to give me negative

523
00:49:19,560 --> 00:49:26,280
60 and add to give me 11. You might notice that this is exactly what we were doing in the previous

524
00:49:26,280 --> 00:49:31,480
problem. It's just here we didn't have to multiply the coefficient of x squared by eight, because the

525
00:49:31,480 --> 00:49:37,560
coefficient of x squared was just one. So to find the two numbers that multiply to negative 60 and

526
00:49:37,560 --> 00:49:43,480
add to 11, you might just be able to come up with them in your head thinking about it. But if not,

527
00:49:43,480 --> 00:49:49,640
you can figure it out pretty systematically by writing out all the factors, pairs of factors,

528
00:49:49,640 --> 00:49:56,040
that multiply to negative 60. So I can start with negative one and 60, negative two and 30,

529
00:49:56,040 --> 00:50:04,200
negative three and 20, and keep going like this until I have found factors that actually add

530
00:50:04,200 --> 00:50:09,480
together to give me the number 11. And now that I look at it, I've already found them.

531
00:50:10,440 --> 00:50:17,160
15 minus four gives me 11. So I don't have to continue with my chart of factors.

532
00:50:17,960 --> 00:50:25,160
Now, once I found those factors, I write out my expression 10x squared, but instead of writing 11x,

533
00:50:25,160 --> 00:50:34,040
I write negative 4x plus 15x. Now I copy down the negative six. Notice that negative 4x plus 15x

534
00:50:34,040 --> 00:50:41,000
equals 11x, that's how I chose those numbers. And so this expression is, evaluates as the same

535
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:46,760
as this expression. I haven't changed my expression. But I have turned it into something that I can

536
00:50:46,760 --> 00:50:51,800
apply factoring by grouping on, look, I've got four terms here. And so if I factor out my greatest

537
00:50:51,800 --> 00:50:58,760
common factor of my first two terms, that's, let's see, I think it's 2x. So I factor out the 2x,

538
00:50:58,760 --> 00:51:06,120
I get 5x minus two. And then I factor out the greatest common factor of 15x and negative six,

539
00:51:06,120 --> 00:51:13,480
that would be three, I get a 5x minus two again, this is working beautifully. So I have a 5x minus

540
00:51:13,480 --> 00:51:22,840
two in each part. And so I put the 5x minus two on the right, and I put what's left from these terms

541
00:51:22,840 --> 00:51:28,760
in here. So that's 2x plus three. And I have factored my expression.

542
00:51:31,400 --> 00:51:35,560
There are a couple of special kinds of expressions that appear frequently,

543
00:51:35,560 --> 00:51:40,040
that it's handy to just memorize the formula for. So the first one is the difference of squares.

544
00:51:40,040 --> 00:51:47,320
If you see something of the form a squared minus b squared, then you can factor that as a plus b

545
00:51:47,320 --> 00:51:53,960
times a minus b. And let's just check that that works. If I do a plus b times a minus b and multiply

546
00:51:53,960 --> 00:52:03,800
that out, I get a squared minus a b plus b a minus b squared, and those middle two terms cancel out.

547
00:52:03,800 --> 00:52:09,480
So it gives me back the difference of squares just like I want it. So for this first example,

548
00:52:10,120 --> 00:52:17,240
if I think of x squared minus 16 as x squared minus four squared, then I can see that's a

549
00:52:17,240 --> 00:52:23,960
difference of squares. And I can immediately write it as x plus four times x minus four. And the second

550
00:52:23,960 --> 00:52:32,520
example, nine p squared minus one, that's the same thing as three p squared minus one squared.

551
00:52:32,520 --> 00:52:41,800
So that's three p plus one times three p minus one. Notice that if I have a sum of squares,

552
00:52:43,160 --> 00:52:50,760
for example, x squared plus four, which is x squared plus two squared,

553
00:52:50,760 --> 00:52:57,560
then that does not factor. The difference of squares formula doesn't apply. And there is no

554
00:52:57,560 --> 00:53:04,280
formula that applies for a sum of squares. There is, however, a formula for both a difference of

555
00:53:04,280 --> 00:53:12,760
cubes and a sum of cubes. The difference of cubes formula, a cube minus b cubed is a minus b times

556
00:53:12,760 --> 00:53:20,200
a squared plus a b plus b squared. The formula for the sum of cubes is pretty much the same,

557
00:53:20,280 --> 00:53:27,640
you just switch the negative and positive sign here and here. So that gives us a plus b times

558
00:53:27,640 --> 00:53:35,160
a squared minus a b plus b squared. As usual, you can check these formulas by multiplying out.

559
00:53:35,960 --> 00:53:43,080
Let's look at one example of using these formulas, y cube plus 27 is actually a sum of two cubes,

560
00:53:43,080 --> 00:53:50,840
because it's y cubed plus three cubed. So I can factor it using the sum of cubes formula

561
00:53:50,840 --> 00:53:59,880
by plugging in y for a and three for b. That gives me y plus three times y squared minus

562
00:53:59,880 --> 00:54:06,200
y times three plus three squared. And I can clean that up a little bit to read y plus three times

563
00:54:06,200 --> 00:54:13,960
y squared minus three y plus nine. So in this video, we went over several methods of factoring.

564
00:54:13,960 --> 00:54:21,640
We did factoring out the greatest common factor. We did factoring by grouping. We did factoring

565
00:54:21,640 --> 00:54:33,080
quadratics. And we did a difference of squares. And we did a difference and a sum of cubes.

566
00:54:33,080 --> 00:54:39,480
In more complicated problems, you may need to apply several of these techniques in order

567
00:54:39,480 --> 00:54:43,720
to get through a single problem. For example, you might need to start by pulling out a greatest

568
00:54:43,720 --> 00:54:51,640
common factor, and then do a factoring of quadratics or something similar. Now go forth and factor.

569
00:54:52,840 --> 00:54:59,080
This video gives some additional examples of factoring. Please pause the video and decide

570
00:54:59,080 --> 00:55:04,120
which of these first five expressions factor and which one does not.

571
00:55:06,120 --> 00:55:11,960
The first expression can be factored by pulling out a common factor of x from each term.

572
00:55:13,320 --> 00:55:22,520
So that becomes x times x plus one. The second example can be factored as a difference of two

573
00:55:22,520 --> 00:55:30,600
squares. Since x squared minus twenty five is something squared minus something else squared.

574
00:55:30,600 --> 00:55:37,080
And we know that anytime we have something like a squared minus b squared, that's a plus b times

575
00:55:37,080 --> 00:55:46,200
a minus b. So we can factor this as x plus five times x minus five. The third one is a sum of

576
00:55:46,200 --> 00:55:52,840
two squares. There's no way to factor a sum of two squares over real numbers. So this is the one

577
00:55:52,840 --> 00:56:01,000
that does not factor. Just for completeness, let's look at the next two. This next one does factor

578
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:08,280
by grouping. When we factor by grouping, we pull the biggest common factor out of the first two

579
00:56:08,360 --> 00:56:15,240
terms. That would be an x squared. That becomes x squared times x plus two. And then we factor

580
00:56:15,240 --> 00:56:21,720
as much as we can out of the next two terms. That would be a three times x plus two. Notice that the

581
00:56:21,720 --> 00:56:29,000
x plus two factor now occurs in both of the resulting terms. So we can pull that x plus two out

582
00:56:29,960 --> 00:56:39,480
and get x plus two times x squared plus three. We can't factor any further because x squared plus

583
00:56:39,480 --> 00:56:47,720
three doesn't factor. Finally, we have a quadratic. This also factors. And I like to factor these

584
00:56:48,440 --> 00:56:57,080
also using a factoring by grouping trick. So first, what I do is I multiply the coefficient of x

585
00:56:57,160 --> 00:57:04,280
squared and the constant term five times eight is 40. I'll write that on the top of my x. Now I

586
00:57:04,280 --> 00:57:10,200
take the coefficient of the x term that's negative 14. And I write that on the bottom part of the x.

587
00:57:10,840 --> 00:57:19,480
Now I'm looking for two numbers that multiply to 40 and add to negative 14. Sometimes I can just

588
00:57:19,480 --> 00:57:27,080
guess numbers like this. But if not, I start writing out factors of 40. So factors of 40,

589
00:57:27,080 --> 00:57:34,200
I could do one times 40. Well, now I just noticed I'm trying to add to a negative number. So if I

590
00:57:34,200 --> 00:57:38,360
use two positive factors, there's no way there's going to add to a negative number. It's better

591
00:57:38,360 --> 00:57:45,080
for me to use negative numbers that factor 40. A negative times a negative still multiplies to 40,

592
00:57:45,080 --> 00:57:50,760
but they have a chance of adding to a negative number. So but negative one and negative 40 of

593
00:57:50,760 --> 00:57:54,760
course don't work. They don't add to negative 14. They add to negative 41. So let me try some other

594
00:57:54,760 --> 00:58:00,760
factors. The next biggest number that divides 40 besides one is two. So I'll try negative two and

595
00:58:00,760 --> 00:58:08,920
negative 20. Those add to negative 22. That doesn't work. Next one that divides 40 would be four. So

596
00:58:08,920 --> 00:58:15,800
I'll try negative four and negative 10. Aha, we have a winner. So negative four plus negative 10

597
00:58:15,800 --> 00:58:22,040
is negative 14. Negative four times negative 10 is positive 40. We've got it. All right. So the next

598
00:58:22,040 --> 00:58:30,200
step is to use factoring by grouping. We're going to first split up this negative 14 x as negative

599
00:58:30,200 --> 00:58:37,880
four x minus 10 x and carry down the eight and the five x squared. Notice that this works because

600
00:58:37,880 --> 00:58:46,280
I picked negative four negative 10 to add up to negative 14. So so negative four x minus 10 x will

601
00:58:46,280 --> 00:58:51,640
add up to negative 14 x. So I've got the same expression just just expanded out a little bit.

602
00:58:51,640 --> 00:58:56,680
Now I have four terms I can do factoring by grouping. So I can group the first two terms

603
00:58:56,680 --> 00:59:02,280
and factor out the biggest thing I can. That would be an x times five x minus four. And now I'll

604
00:59:02,280 --> 00:59:09,320
factor the biggest thing I can out of these two numbers including the the negative. So that becomes

605
00:59:09,320 --> 00:59:16,760
let's see I can factor out a negative two and that becomes five x minus four since negative two times

606
00:59:16,760 --> 00:59:23,240
minus four is eight. All right, I've got the same five x plus four in both my terms. So factoring

607
00:59:23,240 --> 00:59:28,840
by grouping is going swimmingly. I can factor out the five x minus four from both those terms

608
00:59:28,840 --> 00:59:34,840
and I get the x minus two and I factored this quadratic. If I want to of course I can always

609
00:59:34,840 --> 00:59:42,840
check my work by distributing out by multiplying out. So a check here would be multiplying five x

610
00:59:42,840 --> 00:59:51,960
times x is five x squared five x minus times minus two is minus 10 x minus four times x is minus

611
00:59:51,960 --> 00:59:58,440
four x and minus four times minus two is plus eight. So let's see this does check out to exactly

612
00:59:58,440 --> 01:00:08,360
what it should be. So that was the method of factoring a quadratic. And all of these factor

613
01:00:08,360 --> 01:00:16,680
except for the sum of squares. So we saw that factoring by grouping is handy for factoring

614
01:00:17,640 --> 01:00:25,240
this expression here. It was also handy for factoring the quadratic indirectly after splitting up

615
01:00:27,560 --> 01:00:37,160
the middle term into two terms. So how can you tell when an expression is is appropriate to

616
01:00:37,160 --> 01:00:43,400
factor by grouping? There's an easy way to tell that it might be a candidate and that's that it

617
01:00:43,400 --> 01:00:50,040
has four terms. So if you see four terms or in the case of the quadratic you can split it up into

618
01:00:50,040 --> 01:00:53,960
four terms then that's a good candidate for factoring by grouping because you can group the

619
01:00:53,960 --> 01:00:58,920
first two terms, group the second two terms. Factoring by grouping won't always work on

620
01:01:00,840 --> 01:01:06,920
expressions with four terms but that's like the first thing to look for. So let's just review

621
01:01:06,920 --> 01:01:11,800
what are the same main techniques of factoring. We saw these on the previous page. We saw there was

622
01:01:11,800 --> 01:01:16,120
pull out common factors. There's difference of squares.

623
01:01:18,600 --> 01:01:24,120
There's factoring by grouping. There's factoring quadratics.

624
01:01:26,760 --> 01:01:33,240
And one more that I didn't mention is factoring sums and differences of cubes.

625
01:01:33,880 --> 01:01:41,720
That uses the formulas a cubed minus b cubed is a minus b times a squared plus a b plus b

626
01:01:41,720 --> 01:01:49,800
squared and a cubed plus b cubed is a plus b times a squared minus a b plus b squared.

627
01:01:51,800 --> 01:01:58,280
One important tip when factoring, I always recommend doing this first. Pull out the common

628
01:01:59,160 --> 01:02:04,760
factors first. That'll simplify things in making the rest of factoring easier.

629
01:02:05,320 --> 01:02:10,920
One more tip is that you might need to do several of these factoring techniques in one problem.

630
01:02:10,920 --> 01:02:17,000
For example, you might have to first pull out a common factor then factor a difference of squares

631
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:21,080
and then you might notice that one of your factors is itself a difference of squares and you have to

632
01:02:21,080 --> 01:02:27,800
apply a difference of squares again. So don't stop when you factor a little bit. Keep factoring as

633
01:02:27,800 --> 01:02:34,120
far as you can go. Here are some extra examples of factoring quadratics for you to practice.

634
01:02:34,120 --> 01:02:41,640
Please pause the video and give these a try. For the first one, let's multiply two times negative

635
01:02:41,640 --> 01:02:50,600
14. That gives us negative 28 and then we'll bring the three down in the bottom of the x. Now

636
01:02:50,600 --> 01:02:56,360
we're looking for two numbers that multiply to negative 28 and add to three. Well to multiply

637
01:02:56,360 --> 01:03:01,240
two numbers to get a negative 28 will need one of them to be negative and one of them to be positive.

638
01:03:01,240 --> 01:03:11,080
So let's see one negative 128 or one negative 28. Those don't work. Let's see negative 214 or two

639
01:03:11,080 --> 01:03:15,960
negative 14. Those don't work. Hey, I just noticed the positive number had better be bigger than the

640
01:03:15,960 --> 01:03:20,840
negative number so they add to a positive number. Let's see what comes next. How about

641
01:03:21,160 --> 01:03:30,760
negative 4 times 7, 4 times negative 7. I think 4, negative 4 times 7 will work. So I'll write

642
01:03:30,760 --> 01:03:42,920
those here negative 4, 7. Copy down the 2 z squared and I'll split up the 3 z into negative 4 z plus

643
01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:52,200
7 z and then minus 14. Now factoring by grouping pull out a 2 z that becomes z minus 2 pull out a 7

644
01:03:52,200 --> 01:04:01,320
and that becomes z minus 2 again looking good. I've got 2 z plus 7 times z minus 2 as my factored

645
01:04:01,320 --> 01:04:08,760
expression. My second expression I could work at the same way drawing my x and factoring by grouping

646
01:04:08,760 --> 01:04:14,520
that kind of thing but it's actually going to be easier if I notice first that I can pull out a

647
01:04:14,520 --> 01:04:19,480
common factor from all of my terms. That'll make things a lot simpler to deal with. So notice that

648
01:04:19,480 --> 01:04:23,800
a 5 divides each of these terms and in fact I'm going to go ahead and pull out the negative 5 because

649
01:04:23,800 --> 01:04:27,560
I don't like having negatives in front of my squared term. So I'm going to pull out a common

650
01:04:27,560 --> 01:04:33,560
factor of negative 5. Again, it would work if I forgot to do this but it would be a lot more

651
01:04:33,560 --> 01:04:40,840
complicated. So negative 5 v squared this becomes minus, no this becomes plus 9v

652
01:04:41,560 --> 01:04:47,480
since 9 times negative 5 is negative 45 and this becomes minus 10 since negative 10 times

653
01:04:47,480 --> 01:04:53,400
negative 5 is positive 50. Now I can start my x and my factoring by grouping or I can use kind of a

654
01:04:53,400 --> 01:04:58,680
shortcut method which you may have seen before so I can just put v's here and then I know that

655
01:04:58,680 --> 01:05:03,080
whatever numbers go here they're going to have to multiply to the negative 10 and they're going to

656
01:05:03,080 --> 01:05:11,240
have to add to the 9. So that would be a plus 10 and a minus 1 will do the trick.

657
01:05:12,840 --> 01:05:17,480
Those are all my factoring examples for today. I hope you enjoy your snow morning and have a

658
01:05:17,480 --> 01:05:25,160
chance to spend some time working in Alex. Bye. This video is about working with rational

659
01:05:25,160 --> 01:05:30,760
expressions. A rational expression is a fraction usually with variables in it something like

660
01:05:30,760 --> 01:05:38,840
x plus 2 over x squared minus 3 is a rational expression. In this video we'll practice adding,

661
01:05:38,840 --> 01:05:45,640
subtracting, multiplying and dividing rational expressions and simplifying them to lowest terms.

662
01:05:48,200 --> 01:05:53,080
We'll start with simplifying to lowest terms. Recall that if you have a fraction with just

663
01:05:53,080 --> 01:06:00,520
numbers in it something like 21 over 45 we can reduce it to lowest terms by factoring the numerator

664
01:06:01,320 --> 01:06:04,280
and factoring the denominator

665
01:06:07,160 --> 01:06:17,320
and then canceling common factors. So in this example the 3's cancel and our fraction reduces

666
01:06:17,320 --> 01:06:25,240
to 7 over 15. If we want to reduce a rational expression with variables in it to lowest terms

667
01:06:25,320 --> 01:06:31,640
we proceed the same way. First we'll factor the numerator that's 3 times x plus 2

668
01:06:32,280 --> 01:06:39,880
and then factor the denominator. In this case it factors to x plus 2 times x plus 2 we could

669
01:06:39,880 --> 01:06:46,840
also write that as x plus 2 squared. Now we cancel the common factors and we're left with

670
01:06:46,840 --> 01:06:52,680
3 over x plus 2. Definitely a simpler way of writing that rational expression.

671
01:06:53,320 --> 01:07:01,080
Next let's practice multiplying and dividing. Recall that if we multiply two fractions with

672
01:07:01,080 --> 01:07:06,040
just numbers in them we simply multiply the numerators and multiply the denominators. So in

673
01:07:06,040 --> 01:07:15,800
this case we would get 4 times 2 over 3 times 5 or 8 fifteenths. If we want to divide two fractions

674
01:07:15,800 --> 01:07:23,000
like in the second example then we can rewrite it as multiplying by the reciprocal

675
01:07:23,560 --> 01:07:31,000
of the fraction on the denominator. So here we get 4 fifths times 3 halves and that gives us

676
01:07:32,200 --> 01:07:40,840
12 tenths but actually we could reduce that fraction to 6 fifths. We use the same rules when we

677
01:07:40,840 --> 01:07:46,760
compute the product or quotient of two rational expressions with the variables in them. Here

678
01:07:46,760 --> 01:07:55,160
we're trying to divide two rational expressions so instead we can multiply by the reciprocal.

679
01:07:55,160 --> 01:08:02,120
I call this flipping and multiplying and now we just multiply the numerators

680
01:08:03,800 --> 01:08:05,400
and multiply the denominators.

681
01:08:05,800 --> 01:08:15,800
It might be tempting at this point to multiply out to distribute out the numerator and the denominator

682
01:08:15,800 --> 01:08:20,760
but actually it's better to leave it in this factored form and factor it even more completely.

683
01:08:20,760 --> 01:08:26,840
That way we'll be able to reduce the rational expression to cancel the common factors. So let's

684
01:08:27,160 --> 01:08:35,800
the x squared plus x factors as x times x plus 1 and x squared minus 16 that's a difference of

685
01:08:35,800 --> 01:08:44,040
two squares that's x plus 4 times x minus 4. The denominator is already fully factored so we'll

686
01:08:44,040 --> 01:08:51,720
just copy it over and now we can cancel common factors here and here and we're left with x times

687
01:08:51,720 --> 01:09:00,360
x minus 4. This is our final answer. Adding and subtracting fractions is a little more complicated

688
01:09:00,360 --> 01:09:07,000
because we first have to find a common denominator. A common denominator is an expression that both

689
01:09:07,000 --> 01:09:13,800
denominators divide into. It's usually best of the long run to use the least common denominator

690
01:09:13,800 --> 01:09:20,200
which is the smallest expression that both denominators divide into. In this example

691
01:09:20,200 --> 01:09:27,560
if we just want a common denominator we could use 6 times 15 which is 90 because both 6 and 15

692
01:09:27,560 --> 01:09:33,720
divide evenly into 90 but if we want the least common denominator the best way to do that is to

693
01:09:33,720 --> 01:09:44,120
factor the two denominators so 6 is 2 times 3 15 is 3 times 5 and then put together only the factors

694
01:09:44,120 --> 01:09:53,800
we need for both 6 and 15 to divide our numbers so if we just use 2 times 3 times 5 which is 30

695
01:09:55,080 --> 01:10:01,560
we know that 2 times 3 will divide it and 3 times 5 will also divide it and we won't be able to get

696
01:10:01,560 --> 01:10:06,840
a denominator any smaller because we need the factors 2, 3, and 5 in order to ensure both

697
01:10:06,840 --> 01:10:12,920
these numbers divide it. Once we have our least common denominator we can rewrite each of our

698
01:10:12,920 --> 01:10:21,080
fractions in terms of that denominator. So 7, 6 I need to get a 30 in the denominator so I'm going

699
01:10:21,080 --> 01:10:29,240
to multiply that by 5 over 5. I multiply by the factors that are missing from the current

700
01:10:29,240 --> 01:10:34,520
denominator in order to get my least common denominator of 30. For the second fraction

701
01:10:35,160 --> 01:10:48,360
4 15, 15 times 2 is 30 so I'm going to multiply by 2 over 2. Now I can rewrite this as 35 30th

702
01:10:49,480 --> 01:10:56,360
minus 8 30th and now that I have a common denominator I can just subtract my two numerators

703
01:10:56,360 --> 01:11:10,520
and I get 27 30th. If I factor I can reduce this to 3 squared over 2 times 5 which is 9 tenths.

704
01:11:11,640 --> 01:11:16,600
The process for finding the sum of two rational expressions with variables in them

705
01:11:16,600 --> 01:11:22,280
follows the exact same process. First we have to find the least common denominator. I'll do that by

706
01:11:22,280 --> 01:11:30,040
factoring the two denominators. So 2x plus 2 factors as 2 times x plus 1, x squared minus 1

707
01:11:30,040 --> 01:11:36,120
that's a difference of 2 squared so that's x plus 1 times x minus 1. Now for the least common

708
01:11:36,120 --> 01:11:42,280
denominator I'm going to take all the factors I need to get an expression that each of these

709
01:11:42,280 --> 01:11:48,520
divides into. So I need the factor 2, I need the factor x plus 1, and I need the factor x minus 1.

710
01:11:48,520 --> 01:11:53,000
I don't have to repeat the factor x plus 1, I just need to have it one time

711
01:11:53,000 --> 01:11:59,880
and so I will get my least common denominator 2 times x plus 1 times x minus 1. I'm not going to

712
01:11:59,880 --> 01:12:04,440
bother multiplying this out, it's actually better to leave it in factored form to help me simplify

713
01:12:04,440 --> 01:12:12,840
later. Now I can rewrite each of my two rational expressions by multiplying by whatever's missing

714
01:12:12,840 --> 01:12:19,400
from the denominator in terms of the least common denominator. So what I mean is I can rewrite 3 over

715
01:12:19,400 --> 01:12:25,960
2x plus 2. I'll write the 2x plus 2 as 2 times x plus 1 already in factored form. And then I noticed

716
01:12:25,960 --> 01:12:31,800
that compared to the least common denominator I'm missing the factor of x minus 1. So I multiply

717
01:12:32,520 --> 01:12:38,280
the numerator and the denominator by x minus 1. I just need it in the denominator but I can't get

718
01:12:38,280 --> 01:12:42,680
away with just multiplying by the denominator without changing my expression. I have to multiply

719
01:12:42,680 --> 01:12:48,680
by it on the numerator and the denominator so I'm just multiplying by 1 in a fancy form and not

720
01:12:48,680 --> 01:12:53,720
changing the value here. So now I do the same thing for the second rational expression. I'll

721
01:12:53,720 --> 01:12:59,080
write the denominator in factored form to make it easier to see what's missing from the denominator.

722
01:12:59,080 --> 01:13:05,080
What's missing in this denominator compared to my least common denominator is just the factor 2.

723
01:13:05,160 --> 01:13:12,040
So I'll multiply the numerator and the denominator by 2. Now I can rewrite everything. So the first

724
01:13:12,040 --> 01:13:20,520
rational expression becomes 3 times x minus 1 over 2 times x plus 1 x minus 1 and the second one

725
01:13:20,520 --> 01:13:29,880
becomes 5 times 2 over 2 times x plus 1 x minus 1. Notice that I now have a common denominator

726
01:13:29,880 --> 01:13:37,560
so I can just add together my numerators. So I get 3 times x minus 1 plus 10 over 2

727
01:13:37,560 --> 01:13:44,360
times x plus 1 x minus 1. I'd like to simplify this and the best way to do that is to leave the

728
01:13:44,360 --> 01:13:50,600
denominator in factored form but I do have to multiply out the numerator so that I can add

729
01:13:50,600 --> 01:14:02,520
things together. So I get 3x minus 3 plus 10 over 2 times x plus 1 x minus 1 or 3x plus 7 over 2

730
01:14:02,520 --> 01:14:10,600
times x plus 1 x minus 1. Now 3x plus 7 doesn't factor and there's therefore no factors that I

731
01:14:10,600 --> 01:14:17,240
can cancel out. So this is already reduced as much as it can be. This is my final answer.

732
01:14:17,240 --> 01:14:25,960
In this video we saw how to simplify rational expressions to lowest terms by factoring and

733
01:14:25,960 --> 01:14:31,960
canceling common factors. We also saw how to multiply rational expressions by multiplying the

734
01:14:31,960 --> 01:14:37,080
numerator and multiplying the denominator, how to divide rational expressions by flipping and

735
01:14:37,080 --> 01:14:43,080
multiplying, and how to add and subtract rational expressions by writing them in terms of the least

736
01:14:43,160 --> 01:14:50,680
common denominator. This video is about solving quadratic equations. A quadratic equation is

737
01:14:50,680 --> 01:14:57,160
an equation that contains the square of the variable say x squared but no higher powers of x.

738
01:14:58,360 --> 01:15:06,120
The standard form for a quadratic equation is the form ax squared plus bx plus c equals zero

739
01:15:06,840 --> 01:15:16,040
where a, b, and c represent real numbers and a is not zero so that we actually have an x squared

740
01:15:16,040 --> 01:15:25,800
term. Let me give you an example. 3x squared plus 7x minus 2 equals zero is a quadratic equation in

741
01:15:25,800 --> 01:15:37,640
standard form. Here a is 3, b is 7, and c is minus 2. The equation 3x squared equals minus 7x plus 2

742
01:15:37,640 --> 01:15:43,640
is also a quadratic equation. It's just not in standard form. The key steps to solving quadratic

743
01:15:43,640 --> 01:15:51,000
equations are usually to write the equation in standard form and then either factor it

744
01:15:51,960 --> 01:15:56,360
or use the quadratic formula which I'll show you later in this video.

745
01:15:59,400 --> 01:16:06,680
Let's start with the example y squared equals 18 minus 7y. Here our variable is y and we need to

746
01:16:06,680 --> 01:16:13,640
rewrite this quadratic equation in standard form. We can do this by subtracting 18 from both sides

747
01:16:13,640 --> 01:16:22,920
and adding 7y to both sides. That gives us the equation y squared minus 18 plus 7y equals zero

748
01:16:22,920 --> 01:16:29,720
and I can rearrange a little bit to get y squared plus 7y minus 18 equals zero. Now I've got my

749
01:16:29,720 --> 01:16:37,320
equation in standard form. Next I'm going to try to factor it. So I need to look for two numbers

750
01:16:37,320 --> 01:16:45,640
that multiply to negative 18 and add to 7. Two numbers that work are 9 and negative 2,

751
01:16:45,640 --> 01:16:53,640
so I can factor my expression on the left as y plus 9 times y minus 2 equals zero.

752
01:16:54,680 --> 01:16:59,400
Now anytime you have two quantities that multiply together to give you zero,

753
01:17:00,120 --> 01:17:05,080
either the first quantity has to be zero or the second quantity has to be zero or I suppose they

754
01:17:05,080 --> 01:17:10,120
both could be zero in some situations. This is really handy because that means that I know

755
01:17:10,120 --> 01:17:18,440
that either y plus 9 equals zero or y minus 2 equals zero. So I can as my next step set my

756
01:17:18,440 --> 01:17:27,320
factors equal to zero. So y plus 9 equals zero or y minus 2 equals zero which means that y equals

757
01:17:27,320 --> 01:17:34,520
negative 9 or y equals 2. It's not a bad idea to check that those answers actually work by

758
01:17:34,600 --> 01:17:41,720
plugging them into the original equation negative 9 squared does that equal 18 minus 7 times negative

759
01:17:41,720 --> 01:17:49,000
9 and you can work out that it does and similarly 2 squared equals 18 minus 7 times 2.

760
01:17:50,920 --> 01:17:57,240
In the next example, let's find solutions of the equation w squared equals 121. This is a

761
01:17:57,240 --> 01:18:03,880
quadratic equation because it's got a square of my variable w. I can rewrite it in standard form

762
01:18:04,520 --> 01:18:13,720
by subtracting 121 from both sides. Notice that a is equal to one b is equal to zero because there's

763
01:18:13,720 --> 01:18:22,600
no w term and c is equal to negative 121 in the standard form a w squared plus b w plus c equals

764
01:18:22,600 --> 01:18:32,280
zero. Next step, I'm going to try to factor this expression. So since 121 is 11 squared,

765
01:18:32,280 --> 01:18:39,880
this is a difference of two squares and it factors as w plus 11 times w minus 11 is equal to zero.

766
01:18:40,600 --> 01:18:50,600
If I set the factors equal to zero, I get w plus 11 equals zero or w minus 11 equals zero. So w

767
01:18:50,600 --> 01:18:58,200
equals minus 11 or w equals 11. In this example, I could have solved the equation more simply. I

768
01:18:58,200 --> 01:19:05,640
could have instead said that if w squared is 121, then w has to equal plus or minus the square root

769
01:19:05,640 --> 01:19:13,080
of 121. In other words, w is plus or minus 11. If you solve the equation this way, it's important

770
01:19:13,080 --> 01:19:19,560
to remember the plus or minus since minus 11 squared equals 121 just like 11 squared does.

771
01:19:21,000 --> 01:19:27,320
Now let's find the solutions for the equation x times x plus 2 equals 7. Some people might be

772
01:19:27,320 --> 01:19:32,680
tempted to say that, oh, if two numbers multiply to equal seven, then one of them better equal one

773
01:19:32,680 --> 01:19:38,040
and the other equals seven or maybe negative one and negative seven. But that's faulty reasoning

774
01:19:38,040 --> 01:19:45,160
in this case, because x and x plus two don't have to be whole numbers. They could be crazy

775
01:19:45,160 --> 01:19:53,000
fractions or even irrational numbers. So instead, let's rewrite this equation in standard form.

776
01:19:53,720 --> 01:20:01,160
To do that, I'm first going to multiply out. So x times x is x squared, x times 2 is 2x,

777
01:20:01,160 --> 01:20:07,160
that equals seven, and I'll subtract the seven from both sides to get x squared plus 2x minus

778
01:20:07,160 --> 01:20:13,080
seven is zero. Now I'm looking to factor it, so I need two numbers that multiply to negative seven

779
01:20:13,080 --> 01:20:19,400
and add to two. So it's the only way to factor negative seven is as negative one times seven or

780
01:20:19,480 --> 01:20:24,840
seven times negative one. It's easy to see that there are no whole numbers that will

781
01:20:26,120 --> 01:20:31,560
work. So there's no way to factor this expression over the integers. Instead, let's use the quadratic

782
01:20:31,560 --> 01:20:40,760
equation. So we have our leading coefficient of x squared is one. So a is one, b is two, and c is

783
01:20:40,760 --> 01:20:46,600
minus seven. And we're going to plug that into the equation, quadratic equation, which goes x

784
01:20:47,400 --> 01:20:54,520
equals negative b plus or minus the square root of b squared minus 4ac all over 2a.

785
01:20:55,880 --> 01:21:00,280
Different people have different ways of remembering this formula. I'd like to remember it by seeing

786
01:21:00,280 --> 01:21:08,840
it. x equals negative b plus or minus the square root of b squared minus 4ac all over 2a. But you

787
01:21:08,840 --> 01:21:14,680
can use any new monarchy like. Anyway, plugging in here, we have x equals negative 2 plus or minus

788
01:21:14,760 --> 01:21:21,560
the square root of two squared minus four times one times negative seven. It's important to remember

789
01:21:21,560 --> 01:21:30,440
the negative seven there, all over two times one. Now two squared is four, and four times one times

790
01:21:30,440 --> 01:21:37,160
negative seven is negative 28. So this whole quantity under the square root sign becomes four

791
01:21:37,160 --> 01:21:44,440
minus negative 28 or 32. So I can rewrite this as x equals negative two plus or minus the square

792
01:21:44,440 --> 01:21:55,320
root of 32 all over two. Since 32 is 16 times two, and 16 is a perfect square, I can rewrite this as

793
01:21:55,320 --> 01:22:00,920
negative two plus or minus the square root of 16 times the square root of two over two, which is

794
01:22:01,000 --> 01:22:04,760
negative two plus or minus four times the square root of two over two.

795
01:22:06,680 --> 01:22:14,440
Next, I'm going to split up my fraction as negative two over two plus or minus four square

796
01:22:14,440 --> 01:22:20,760
root of two over two, and then simplify those fractions. This becomes negative one plus or

797
01:22:20,760 --> 01:22:28,120
minus two square root of two. So my answers are negative one plus two square root of two,

798
01:22:28,120 --> 01:22:33,240
and negative one minus two square root of two. And if I need a decimal answer for any reason,

799
01:22:33,240 --> 01:22:40,040
I could work those out on my calculator. As our final example, let's find all real solutions for

800
01:22:40,040 --> 01:22:47,400
the equation one half y squared equals one third y minus two. I'll start as usual by putting it in

801
01:22:47,400 --> 01:22:56,840
standard form. So that gives me one half y squared minus one third y plus two equals zero. I could

802
01:22:56,840 --> 01:23:02,280
go ahead and start trying to factor or use the quadratic formula right now. But I find fractional

803
01:23:02,280 --> 01:23:07,080
coefficients kind of annoying. So I'd like to get rid of them by doing what I call clearing the

804
01:23:07,080 --> 01:23:11,720
denominator. That means I'm going to multiply the whole entire equation by the least common

805
01:23:11,720 --> 01:23:17,080
denominator. In this case, the least common denominator is two times three or six. So I'll

806
01:23:17,080 --> 01:23:22,200
multiply the whole equation by six. I have to make sure I multiply both sides of the equation,

807
01:23:22,200 --> 01:23:28,360
but in this case, six times zero is just zero. And when I distribute the six, I get three y squared

808
01:23:28,360 --> 01:23:35,320
minus two y plus 12 equals zero. Now, I could try to factor this, but I think it's easier

809
01:23:35,320 --> 01:23:43,960
probably just to plunge in and use the quadratic formula. So I get x equals negative b, that's

810
01:23:43,960 --> 01:23:52,360
negative negative two or two plus or minus the square root of b squared minus four times a times

811
01:23:52,360 --> 01:24:02,040
c all over two a. Working out the stuff on the square root sign negative two squared is four.

812
01:24:02,040 --> 01:24:10,840
And here we have, let's see 144. So this simplifies to x equals two plus or minus the square root of

813
01:24:11,720 --> 01:24:19,320
four minus 144, that's negative 140 all over six. Well, if you're concerned about the

814
01:24:19,320 --> 01:24:24,360
negative number under the square root sign, you should be, we can't take the square root of a

815
01:24:24,360 --> 01:24:30,200
negative number and get and get a real number as our answer, there's no real number whose square is

816
01:24:30,200 --> 01:24:37,640
a negative number. And therefore, our conclusion is we have no real solutions to this quadratic

817
01:24:37,640 --> 01:24:44,600
equation. In this video, we solve some quadratic equations by first writing them in standard form

818
01:24:44,600 --> 01:24:50,680
and then either factoring or using the quadratic formula. In some examples, factoring doesn't

819
01:24:50,680 --> 01:24:56,040
work. It's not possible to factor the equation. But in fact, using the quadratic formula will

820
01:24:56,040 --> 01:25:02,600
always work, even if it's also possible to solve it by factoring. So you can't really lose by using

821
01:25:02,600 --> 01:25:09,000
the quadratic formula. It's just sometimes it'll be faster to factor instead. This video is about

822
01:25:09,000 --> 01:25:15,800
solving equations with absolute values in them. Recall that the absolute value of a positive

823
01:25:15,800 --> 01:25:22,760
number is just the number, but the absolute value of a negative number is its opposite. In general,

824
01:25:22,760 --> 01:25:27,960
I think of the absolute value of a number as representing its distance from zero on the number

825
01:25:27,960 --> 01:25:37,800
line. The number four and the number negative four are both at distance four from zero. And so the

826
01:25:37,800 --> 01:25:46,840
absolute value of both of them is four. Similarly, if I write the equation, the absolute value of x

827
01:25:46,840 --> 01:25:57,480
is three, that means that x has to be three units away from zero on the number line. And so x would

828
01:25:57,480 --> 01:26:03,800
have to be either negative three or three. Let's start with the equation three times the absolute

829
01:26:03,800 --> 01:26:12,200
value of x plus two equals four. I'd like to isolate the absolute value part of the equation.

830
01:26:13,160 --> 01:26:16,920
I can do this by starting with my original equation,

831
01:26:17,480 --> 01:26:25,800
subtracting two from both sides, and dividing both sides by three.

832
01:26:30,200 --> 01:26:37,480
Now I'll think in terms of distance. On a number line, the absolute value of x is two thirds,

833
01:26:37,480 --> 01:26:47,800
means that x is two thirds away from zero. So x could be here, or here, at negative two thirds,

834
01:26:47,800 --> 01:26:55,480
or at two thirds. And the answer to my equation is x is negative two thirds, or two thirds.

835
01:26:56,760 --> 01:27:04,280
I can check my answers by plugging in three times the absolute value of negative two thirds

836
01:27:04,280 --> 01:27:09,560
plus two. I need to check if that equals four. Well, the absolute value of negative two thirds

837
01:27:09,560 --> 01:27:15,640
is just two thirds. So this is three times two thirds plus two, which works out to four.

838
01:27:18,120 --> 01:27:25,480
Similarly, if I plug in positive two thirds, it also works out to give me a correct answer.

839
01:27:26,360 --> 01:27:30,600
This second example is a little different, because the absolute value sign is around

840
01:27:30,600 --> 01:27:39,160
a more complicated expression, not just around the x. I would start by isolating the absolute value part,

841
01:27:42,120 --> 01:27:48,120
but it's already isolated. So I'll just go ahead and jump to thinking about distance

842
01:27:48,120 --> 01:27:55,160
on the number line. So on my number line, the whole expression three x plus two

843
01:27:55,800 --> 01:28:05,000
is supposed to be at a distance of four from zero. So that means that three x plus two is here at four,

844
01:28:05,000 --> 01:28:14,040
or three x plus two is at negative four. I'll write those as equations. Three x plus two equals four,

845
01:28:14,040 --> 01:28:21,880
or three x plus two is minus four, and then I can solve. So this becomes three x equals two,

846
01:28:21,960 --> 01:28:30,200
or x equals two thirds. And over here, I get three x equals minus six, or x equals minus two.

847
01:28:31,480 --> 01:28:38,280
Finally, I'll check my answers. I'll leave it to you to verify that they both work.

848
01:28:39,720 --> 01:28:44,920
A common mistake on absolute value equations is to get rid of the absolute value signs,

849
01:28:44,920 --> 01:28:50,680
like we did here, and then just solve for one answer instead of solving for both answers.

850
01:28:51,480 --> 01:28:55,560
Another mistake sometimes people make is once they get the first answer, they just assume

851
01:28:55,560 --> 01:29:02,680
that the negative of that works also. But that doesn't always work. In the first example,

852
01:29:02,680 --> 01:29:06,600
our two answers were both the negatives of each other. But in our second examples,

853
01:29:06,600 --> 01:29:11,560
our two answers were not just the opposites of each other. One was two thirds, and the other was

854
01:29:11,560 --> 01:29:18,440
negative two. In this third example, let's again isolate the absolute value part of the equation.

855
01:29:18,520 --> 01:29:27,240
So starting with our original equation, we can subtract 16 from both sides,

856
01:29:28,760 --> 01:29:32,760
and divide both sides by five, or equivalently multiply by one fifth.

857
01:29:37,560 --> 01:29:44,040
Now let's think about distance on the number line. We have an absolute value needs to equal

858
01:29:44,040 --> 01:29:50,920
negative three. So that means whatever is inside the absolute value sign needs to be at distance

859
01:29:50,920 --> 01:29:56,920
negative three from zero. Well, you can't be at distance negative three from zero.

860
01:29:57,480 --> 01:30:01,320
Another way of thinking about this is you can't have the absolute value of something and end up

861
01:30:01,320 --> 01:30:07,480
with a negative number. Absolute value is always positive or zero. So this equation doesn't actually

862
01:30:07,480 --> 01:30:17,560
make sense. And there are no solutions to this equation. In this video, we solved absolute

863
01:30:17,560 --> 01:30:24,680
value equations. In many cases, an absolute value equation will have two solutions. But in some cases,

864
01:30:24,680 --> 01:30:32,440
it'll have no solutions. And occasionally, it'll have just one solution. This video is about solving

865
01:30:32,440 --> 01:30:39,240
rational equations. A rational equation like this one is an equation that has rational expressions

866
01:30:39,240 --> 01:30:43,080
in it. In other words, an equation that has some variables in the denominator.

867
01:30:45,000 --> 01:30:49,640
There are several different approaches for solving a rational equation, but they all start

868
01:30:49,640 --> 01:30:56,200
by finding the least common denominator. In this example, the denominators are x plus three and x,

869
01:30:56,200 --> 01:31:02,280
we can think of one as just having a denominator of one. Since the denominators don't have any

870
01:31:02,280 --> 01:31:07,000
factors in common, I can find the least common denominator just by multiplying them together.

871
01:31:08,520 --> 01:31:15,320
My next step is going to be clearing the denominator. By this, I mean that I multiply

872
01:31:15,320 --> 01:31:23,400
both sides of my equation by this least common denominator, x plus three times x. I multiply

873
01:31:23,400 --> 01:31:30,200
on the left side of the equation. And I multiply by the same thing on the right side of the equation.

874
01:31:30,200 --> 01:31:36,360
Since I'm doing the same thing, the both sides of the equation, I don't change the value of the

875
01:31:36,360 --> 01:31:42,040
equation. Multiplying the least common denominator on both sides of the equation is equivalent to

876
01:31:42,040 --> 01:31:47,800
multiplying it by all three terms in the equation. I can see this when I multiply out.

877
01:31:49,080 --> 01:31:56,280
I'll rewrite the left side the same as before pretty much. And then I'll distribute the right

878
01:31:56,280 --> 01:32:04,440
side to get x plus three times x times one plus x plus three times x times one over x.

879
01:32:04,440 --> 01:32:10,280
So I've actually multiplied the least common denominator by all three terms of my equation.

880
01:32:10,280 --> 01:32:16,040
Now I can have a blast canceling things. The x plus three cancels with the x plus three on the

881
01:32:16,040 --> 01:32:23,320
denominator. The here are nothing cancels out because there's no denominator. And here the x

882
01:32:23,320 --> 01:32:28,440
in the numerator cancels with the x in the denominator. So I can rewrite my expression as

883
01:32:28,440 --> 01:32:36,920
x squared equals x plus three times x times one plus x plus three. Now I'm going to simplify.

884
01:32:38,440 --> 01:32:45,400
So I'll leave the x squared alone on this side, I'll distribute out x squared plus three x plus

885
01:32:45,400 --> 01:32:53,720
x plus three. Hey look the x squareds cancel on both sides. And so I get zero equals four x plus

886
01:32:53,720 --> 01:33:01,400
three. So four x is negative three and x is negative three fourths. Finally I'm going to plug in my

887
01:33:01,400 --> 01:33:06,840
answer to check. This is a good idea for any kind of equation. But it's especially important for a

888
01:33:06,840 --> 01:33:11,320
rational equation because occasionally for rational equations you'll get what's called extraneous

889
01:33:11,320 --> 01:33:15,400
solutions. Solutions that don't actually work in your original equation because they make the

890
01:33:15,400 --> 01:33:20,440
denominator zero. Now in this example I don't think we're going to get any extraneous equations

891
01:33:20,440 --> 01:33:26,360
because negative three fourths is not going to make any of these denominators zero. So it should

892
01:33:26,360 --> 01:33:38,680
work out fine when I plug in. If I plug in I get this. I can simplify the denominator here negative

893
01:33:38,680 --> 01:33:45,480
three fourths plus three. Three is twelve fourths. That becomes nine fourths. And this is one I'll flip

894
01:33:45,480 --> 01:33:55,160
and multiply to get minus four thirds. So here I can simplify my complex fraction. It ends up being

895
01:33:55,160 --> 01:34:01,720
negative three ninths and one minus four thirds is negative one third. So that all seems to check out.

896
01:34:01,720 --> 01:34:10,680
And so my final answer is x equals negative three fourths. This next example looks a little trickier

897
01:34:10,680 --> 01:34:17,720
and it is. But the same approach will work. First I'll find the least common denominator. So here my

898
01:34:17,720 --> 01:34:27,880
denominators are c minus five, c plus one, and c squared minus four c minus five. I'm going to

899
01:34:27,880 --> 01:34:35,480
factor that as c minus five times c plus one. Now my least common denominator needs to have

900
01:34:35,480 --> 01:34:41,720
just enough factors to that each of these denominators divide into it. So I need the factor

901
01:34:41,720 --> 01:34:47,560
c minus five. I need the factor c plus one. And now I've already got all the factors I need for

902
01:34:47,560 --> 01:34:54,840
this denominator. So here is my least common denominator. Next step is to clear the denominators.

903
01:34:54,840 --> 01:35:02,120
So I do this by multiplying both sides of the equation by my least common denominator. In fact,

904
01:35:02,120 --> 01:35:06,680
I can just multiply each of the three terms by this least common denominator.

905
01:35:09,400 --> 01:35:14,760
I went ahead and wrote my third denominator in factored form to make it easier to see what

906
01:35:14,760 --> 01:35:24,760
cancels. Now canceling time not dies. This dies and both of those factors die. Canceling out the

907
01:35:24,760 --> 01:35:30,040
denominators the whole point of multiplying by the least common denominator. You're multiplying by

908
01:35:30,040 --> 01:35:33,960
something that's big enough to kill every single denominator. So you don't have to deal with

909
01:35:33,960 --> 01:35:44,680
denominators anymore. Now I'm going to simplify by multiplying out. So I get let's see c plus one

910
01:35:44,680 --> 01:35:54,760
times four c that's four c squared plus four c. Now I get minus just c minus five. And then over

911
01:35:54,760 --> 01:36:06,040
here I get three c squared plus three. I can rewrite the minus quantity c minus five as minus c plus

912
01:36:06,040 --> 01:36:15,160
five. And now I can subtract the three c squared from both sides to get just a c squared over here.

913
01:36:16,200 --> 01:36:25,960
And the four c minus c that becomes three c. And finally I can subtract the three from both

914
01:36:25,960 --> 01:36:34,200
sides to get c squared plus three c plus two equals zero. I've got myself a quadratic equation

915
01:36:34,200 --> 01:36:41,480
that looks like a nice one that factors. So this factors to c plus one times c plus two equals zero.

916
01:36:42,040 --> 01:36:49,800
So either c plus one is zero or c plus two is zero. So c equals negative one or c equals negative two.

917
01:36:52,120 --> 01:36:59,480
Now let's see we need to still check our answers. Without even going to the trouble of

918
01:36:59,480 --> 01:37:05,480
calculating anything, I can see that c equals negative one is not going to work. Because if I plug

919
01:37:05,480 --> 01:37:13,240
it in to this denominator here, I get a denominator zero, which doesn't make sense. So c equals minus

920
01:37:13,240 --> 01:37:22,040
one is an extraneous solution. It doesn't actually satisfy my original equation. And so I can just

921
01:37:22,120 --> 01:37:29,880
cross it right out. c equals negative two. I can go if I go ahead and that doesn't make any of my

922
01:37:29,880 --> 01:37:35,480
denominator zero. So if I haven't made any mistakes, it should satisfy my original equation. But

923
01:37:36,440 --> 01:37:45,880
I'll just plug it in to be sure. And after some simplifying, I get a true statement.

924
01:37:46,440 --> 01:37:53,320
So my final answer is c equals negative two. In this video, we solved a couple of rational

925
01:37:53,320 --> 01:38:00,920
equations using the method of finding the least common denominator and then clearing the denominator.

926
01:38:02,200 --> 01:38:06,840
We cleared the denominator by multiplying both sides of the equation by the least common denominator

927
01:38:06,840 --> 01:38:13,080
or equivalently multiplying each of the terms by that denominator. There's another equivalent

928
01:38:13,160 --> 01:38:19,160
method that some people prefer. It still starts out the same, we find the least common denominator,

929
01:38:19,160 --> 01:38:27,480
but then we write all the fractions over that least common denominator. So in this example,

930
01:38:27,480 --> 01:38:33,720
we'd still use the least common denominator of x plus three times x. But our next step would be to

931
01:38:33,720 --> 01:38:38,680
write each of these rational expressions over that common denominator by multiplying the top and

932
01:38:39,640 --> 01:38:45,960
the bottom by the appropriate things. So one, in order to get the common denominator of x plus

933
01:38:45,960 --> 01:38:51,880
three x, I need to multiply the top and the bottom by x plus three times x, one over x, I need to

934
01:38:51,880 --> 01:38:57,640
multiply the top and the bottom just by x plus three, since that's what's missing from the denominator

935
01:38:57,640 --> 01:39:08,360
x. Now if I simplify a little bit, let's see, this is x squared over that common denominator. And

936
01:39:10,840 --> 01:39:17,560
here I have just x plus three times x over that denominator. And here I have x plus three over

937
01:39:17,560 --> 01:39:24,760
that common denominator. Now add together my fractions on the right side. So they have a

938
01:39:24,760 --> 01:39:33,640
common denominator. So this is x plus three times x plus x plus three. And now I have two

939
01:39:33,640 --> 01:39:39,560
fractions that have that are equal that have the same denominator, therefore their numerators have

940
01:39:39,560 --> 01:39:50,280
to be equal also. So the next step is to set the numerators equal. So I get x squared is x plus three

941
01:39:50,280 --> 01:39:57,240
times x plus x plus three. And if you look back at the previous way we solved this equation,

942
01:39:57,240 --> 01:40:02,280
you'll recognize this equation. And so from here on, we just continue as before.

943
01:40:05,560 --> 01:40:09,400
When choosing between these two methods, I personally tend to prefer the clear the denominators

944
01:40:09,400 --> 01:40:13,320
method because it's a little bit less writing, you don't have to, you get rid of those denominators

945
01:40:13,320 --> 01:40:17,720
earlier, you don't have to write them as many times. But some people find this one a little bit

946
01:40:17,720 --> 01:40:21,560
easier to remember a little easier to understand either of these methods is fine.

947
01:40:23,080 --> 01:40:30,360
One last caution, don't forget at the end to check your solutions and eliminate any extraneous

948
01:40:30,360 --> 01:40:37,480
solutions. These will be solutions that make the denominators of your original equations go to zero.

949
01:40:38,520 --> 01:40:44,600
This video is about solving radical equations. That is equations like this one that have square

950
01:40:44,600 --> 01:40:51,080
root signs in them, or cube roots or any other kind of radical. When I see an equation with a

951
01:40:51,080 --> 01:40:55,960
square root in it, I really want to get rid of the square root. But it'll be easiest to get rid

952
01:40:55,960 --> 01:41:02,360
of the square root. If I first isolate the square root. In other words, I want to get the term with

953
01:41:02,360 --> 01:41:07,800
the square root in it on one side of the equation by itself, and everything else on the other side

954
01:41:07,800 --> 01:41:13,640
of the equation. If I start with my original equation x plus the square root of x equals 12,

955
01:41:14,280 --> 01:41:20,680
and I subtract x from both sides, then that does isolate the square root term on the left side

956
01:41:20,680 --> 01:41:26,760
with everything else on the right. Once I've isolated the term with the square root, I'm going

957
01:41:26,760 --> 01:41:37,000
to get rid of the square root. And I'll do that by squaring both sides of my equation. So I'll

958
01:41:37,000 --> 01:41:46,600
take the square root of x equals 12 minus x and square both sides. Now the square root of x squared

959
01:41:46,600 --> 01:41:51,720
is just x, taking the square root and then squaring those operations undo each other.

960
01:41:53,160 --> 01:42:00,680
To work out 12 minus x squared, I'll write it out and distribute 12 times 12 is 144.

961
01:42:01,480 --> 01:42:08,680
12 times minus x is minus 12 x. I get another minus 12 x from here.

962
01:42:10,280 --> 01:42:18,200
And finally minus x times minus x is positive x squared. So I can combine my minus 12 x, so that's

963
01:42:18,200 --> 01:42:28,200
minus 24 x. And now I can subtract x from both sides to get zero equals 144 minus 25 x plus x

964
01:42:28,200 --> 01:42:35,160
squared. That's a quadratic equation. I'll rewrite it in a little bit more standard form here.

965
01:42:36,840 --> 01:42:42,040
So now I've got a familiar quadratic equation with no radical signs left in my equation.

966
01:42:42,040 --> 01:42:47,400
I'll just proceed to solve it like I usually do for a quadratic. I'll try to factor it. So I'm going

967
01:42:47,400 --> 01:42:54,600
to look for two numbers that multiply to 144 and add to minus 25. Well, I know I'm going to need

968
01:42:54,840 --> 01:43:01,800
negative numbers to get to negative 25. And in fact, I'll need two negative numbers. So they

969
01:43:01,800 --> 01:43:08,200
still multiply to a positive number. So I'll start listing some factors of 144. I could have negative

970
01:43:08,200 --> 01:43:17,480
one and a negative 144, negative two, and negative 72, negative four, negative 36, and so on.

971
01:43:18,360 --> 01:43:21,240
Once I've listed out the possible factors, it's not hard to find

972
01:43:22,040 --> 01:43:29,480
the two that add to negative 25. So that's negative nine and negative 16. So now I can factor my

973
01:43:29,480 --> 01:43:37,800
quadratic equation as x minus nine times x minus 16 equals zero. That means that x minus nine is zero

974
01:43:37,800 --> 01:43:46,040
or x minus 16 is zero. So x equals nine or x equals 16. I'm almost done. But there's one last

975
01:43:46,040 --> 01:43:53,400
very important step. And that's to check the solutions so that we can eliminate any extraneous

976
01:43:53,400 --> 01:43:59,720
solutions. An extraneous solution is a solution that we get that does not actually satisfy

977
01:43:59,720 --> 01:44:05,160
our original equation. And extraneous solutions can happen when you're solving equations with

978
01:44:05,160 --> 01:44:11,400
radicals in them. So let's first check x equals nine. If we plug in to our original equation,

979
01:44:11,400 --> 01:44:16,360
we get nine plus the square root of nine and we want that to equal 12. Well, the square root of

980
01:44:16,360 --> 01:44:23,400
nine is three, and nine plus three does indeed equal 12. So that solution checks out. Now let's

981
01:44:23,400 --> 01:44:29,560
try x equals 16. Plugging in, we get 16 plus the square root of 16. And that's supposed to equal

982
01:44:29,560 --> 01:44:36,840
12. Well, that says 16 plus four is supposed to equal 12. But that most definitely is not true.

983
01:44:36,840 --> 01:44:45,400
And so x equals 16 turns out to be extraneous solution. And our only solution is x equals nine.

984
01:45:07,240 --> 01:45:34,440
This next equation might not look like an equation involving radicals. But in fact, we can think

985
01:45:34,520 --> 01:45:40,520
of a fractional exponent as being a radical in disguise. Let's start by doing the same thing

986
01:45:40,520 --> 01:45:47,560
we did on the previous problem by isolating. This time, we'll isolate the part of the equation

987
01:45:49,320 --> 01:45:54,280
that involves the fractional exponent. So I'll start with the original equation,

988
01:45:54,280 --> 01:45:59,960
two times p to the fourth fifths equals one eighth, and I'll divide both sides by two,

989
01:45:59,960 --> 01:46:07,080
or equivalently, I can multiply both sides by one half. That gives me p to the fourth fifths

990
01:46:07,080 --> 01:46:12,760
equals one sixteenth. And I've effectively isolated the part of the equation with the

991
01:46:12,760 --> 01:46:20,520
fractional exponent as much as possible. Now, in the previous example, the next step was to get rid

992
01:46:20,520 --> 01:46:26,920
of the radical. In this example, we're going to get rid of the fractional exponent. And I'm going

993
01:46:26,920 --> 01:46:33,320
to actually do this in two stages. First, I'm going to raise both sides to the fifth power.

994
01:46:35,720 --> 01:46:41,480
That's because when I take an exponent to an exponent, I multiply my exponents,

995
01:46:42,120 --> 01:46:48,120
and so that becomes just p to the fourth equals one sixteenth to the fifth power.

996
01:46:48,920 --> 01:46:55,080
Now I'm going to get rid of the fourth power by raising both sides to the one fourth power

997
01:46:55,080 --> 01:47:00,840
or by taking the fourth root. There's something that you need to be careful about, though, when

998
01:47:00,840 --> 01:47:08,600
taking an even root, or the one over an even number power, you always have to consider

999
01:47:09,240 --> 01:47:17,960
plus or minus your answer. It's kind of like when you write x squared equals four, and you

1000
01:47:17,960 --> 01:47:23,720
take the square root of both sides, x could equal plus or minus the square root of four, right,

1001
01:47:23,720 --> 01:47:30,440
x could equal plus or minus two, since minus two squared is for just as well as two squared.

1002
01:47:31,080 --> 01:47:39,800
So that's why when you take an even root, or a one over an even power of both sides,

1003
01:47:39,800 --> 01:47:47,160
you always need to include the plus or minus sign. When it's an odd root or one over an odd power,

1004
01:47:47,160 --> 01:47:54,520
you don't need to do that. If you had something like x cubed equals negative eight, then x equals

1005
01:47:54,520 --> 01:47:59,320
the cube root of negative eight, which is negative two would be your only solution. You don't need

1006
01:47:59,320 --> 01:48:06,040
to do the plus or minus because positive two wouldn't work. So that aside explains why we need this

1007
01:48:06,040 --> 01:48:13,320
plus or minus power. And now p to the four to the one fourth, when I raise a power to a power,

1008
01:48:13,400 --> 01:48:19,800
I multiply by exponents. So that's just p to the one, which is equal to plus or minus

1009
01:48:19,800 --> 01:48:27,560
one sixteenth to the fifth power to the one fourth power. Now I just need to simplify this

1010
01:48:27,560 --> 01:48:33,480
expression. I don't really want to raise one sixteenth to the fifth power, because 16 to the

1011
01:48:33,480 --> 01:48:38,760
fifth power is like a really huge number. So I think I'm actually going to rewrite this first

1012
01:48:39,560 --> 01:48:49,080
as p equals plus or minus one sixteenth, I'll write it back as the five fourth power again.

1013
01:48:50,200 --> 01:48:54,840
And as I continue to solve using my exponent rules,

1014
01:48:57,080 --> 01:49:06,040
I'm going to prefer to write this as one sixteenth to the fourth root to the fifth power,

1015
01:49:06,040 --> 01:49:10,920
because it's going to be easier to take the fourth root. Let's see the fourth root of one

1016
01:49:10,920 --> 01:49:15,240
sixteenth is the same thing as the fourth root of one over the fourth root of 16,

1017
01:49:15,240 --> 01:49:21,080
raise all that to the fifth power, fourth root of one is just one, and the fourth root of 16 is two,

1018
01:49:21,800 --> 01:49:26,840
raise that to the fifth power. That's just going to be one to the fifth over two to the fifth,

1019
01:49:26,920 --> 01:49:29,720
which is plus or minus one 30 seconds.

1020
01:49:32,600 --> 01:49:40,600
The last step is to check answers. So I have the two answers p equals one 30 second and p

1021
01:49:40,600 --> 01:49:48,680
equals minus one 30 seconds. And if I plug those both in one 30 second to the fourth fifth power,

1022
01:49:48,680 --> 01:49:57,800
that gives me two times one to the fourth fifth power over 32 to the fourth fifth power,

1023
01:49:58,440 --> 01:50:07,320
which is two times one over 32 fifth rooted to the fourth power, fifth root of 32 is two,

1024
01:50:07,960 --> 01:50:14,520
raise that to the fourth power, I get 16. So this is two times one sixteenth, which is one eighth,

1025
01:50:14,520 --> 01:50:23,480
just as we wanted in the original equation up here. Similarly, we can check that the p equals

1026
01:50:23,480 --> 01:50:28,520
negative one 30 second actually does satisfy the equation. I'll leave that step to the viewer.

1027
01:50:31,800 --> 01:50:37,400
So our two solutions are p equals one over 32 and p equals minus one over 32.

1028
01:50:38,120 --> 01:50:42,200
I do want to point out an alternate approach to getting rid of the fractional exponent.

1029
01:50:42,760 --> 01:50:48,760
We could have gotten rid of it all in one fell swoop by raising both sides of our equation

1030
01:50:48,760 --> 01:50:56,520
to the five fourths power. Five fourths is the reciprocal of four fifths. So when I use my

1031
01:50:56,520 --> 01:51:02,680
exponent rules, and say that when I raise the power to the power, I multiply my exponents,

1032
01:51:02,680 --> 01:51:09,240
that gives me p to the four fifths times five fourths is plus or minus one sixteenth to the

1033
01:51:09,240 --> 01:51:16,680
five fourths. In other words, p to the one power, which is just p is plus or minus one sixteenth

1034
01:51:16,680 --> 01:51:22,520
to the five fourths. So that's an alternate and possibly faster way to get to the solution.

1035
01:51:22,520 --> 01:51:27,640
Once again, the plus or minus comes from the fact that when we take the five fourth power,

1036
01:51:27,640 --> 01:51:33,560
we're really taking an even root of fourth root. And so we need to consider both positive and

1037
01:51:33,560 --> 01:51:40,280
negative answers. This video is about solving radical equations, that is equations like this one

1038
01:51:41,000 --> 01:51:45,320
that have square root signs in them, or cube roots or any other kind of radical.

1039
01:51:46,840 --> 01:51:54,120
In this video, we solved radical equations by first isolating the radical sign or the fractional

1040
01:51:54,120 --> 01:52:03,880
exponent, and then removing the radical sign or the fractional exponent by either squaring

1041
01:52:03,880 --> 01:52:12,200
both sides or taking the reciprocal power of both sides. This video is about solving inequalities

1042
01:52:12,200 --> 01:52:17,960
that have absolute value signs in them. Let's look at the inequality absolute value of x is

1043
01:52:17,960 --> 01:52:23,560
less than five on the number line. Thinking of absolute value as distance, this means that the

1044
01:52:23,560 --> 01:52:31,080
distance between x and zero is less than five units. So x has to live somewhere in between

1045
01:52:31,080 --> 01:52:38,840
negative five and five. We can express this as an inequality without absolute value signs

1046
01:52:38,840 --> 01:52:45,880
by saying negative five is less than x, which is less than five, or we can use interval notation,

1047
01:52:45,880 --> 01:52:52,920
soft bracket, negative five, five, soft bracket. Both of these formulations are equivalent to

1048
01:52:52,920 --> 01:52:59,320
the original one, but don't involve the absolute value signs. In the second example, we're looking

1049
01:52:59,320 --> 01:53:04,920
for the values of x for which the absolute value of x is greater than or equal to five.

1050
01:53:06,360 --> 01:53:12,920
On the number line, this means that the distance of x from the zero is got to be

1051
01:53:12,920 --> 01:53:19,560
bigger than or equal to five units. A distance bigger than five units means that x has to live

1052
01:53:19,560 --> 01:53:25,880
somewhere over here, or somewhere over here, where it's farther than five units away from zero.

1053
01:53:26,760 --> 01:53:32,600
Of course, x could also have a distance equal to five units. So I'll fill in that dot and

1054
01:53:32,600 --> 01:53:39,560
shade in the other parts of the number line that satisfy my inequality. Now I can rewrite the

1055
01:53:39,560 --> 01:53:45,880
inequality without the absolute value symbols by saying that x is less than or equal to negative

1056
01:53:45,880 --> 01:53:52,680
five, or x is greater than or equal to five. I could also write this in interval notation,

1057
01:53:54,040 --> 01:54:01,480
soft bracket, negative infinity, negative five, hard bracket. And the second part is hard bracket,

1058
01:54:01,480 --> 01:54:08,680
five, infinity, soft bracket. I combine these with a U for union, because I'm trying to describe

1059
01:54:08,680 --> 01:54:14,760
all these points on the number line together with all these other points. Let's take this analysis

1060
01:54:14,760 --> 01:54:19,960
a step further with a slightly more complicated problem. Now I want the absolute value of three

1061
01:54:19,960 --> 01:54:28,040
minus two t to be less than four. An absolute value less than four means a distance less than four on

1062
01:54:28,040 --> 01:54:34,200
the number line. But it's not the variable t that lives in here at a distance of less than four from

1063
01:54:34,200 --> 01:54:44,920
zero. It's the whole expression three minus two t. So three minus two t lives somewhere in here. And

1064
01:54:44,920 --> 01:54:52,920
I can rewrite this as an inequality without absolute value signs by saying negative four is less than

1065
01:54:52,920 --> 01:54:59,880
three minus two t is less than four. Now I have a compound inequality that I can solve the usual

1066
01:54:59,880 --> 01:55:06,360
way. First, I'll subtract three from all three sides to get negative seven is less than negative

1067
01:55:06,360 --> 01:55:13,960
two t is less than one. And now I'll divide all three sides by negative two. Since negative two

1068
01:55:13,960 --> 01:55:22,600
is a negative number, this reverses the directions of the inequalities. Simplifying I get seven halves

1069
01:55:22,600 --> 01:55:29,080
is greater than t is greater than negative one half. So my final answer on the number line

1070
01:55:29,080 --> 01:55:33,640
looks like all the stuff between negative a half and seven halves,

1071
01:55:35,560 --> 01:55:41,240
but not including the endpoints and an interval notation I can write this soft bracket negative

1072
01:55:41,240 --> 01:55:46,920
a half seven halves soft bracket. Please pause the video and try the next problem on your own.

1073
01:55:48,120 --> 01:55:53,800
Thinking in terms of distance, this inequality says that the distance between the expression

1074
01:55:53,800 --> 01:56:00,120
three minus two t and zero is always bigger than four. Let me draw this on the number line.

1075
01:56:01,400 --> 01:56:08,440
If three minus two t has a distance bigger than four from zero, then it can't be in this region

1076
01:56:08,440 --> 01:56:13,160
that's near zero, it has to be on the outside in one of these two regions.

1077
01:56:14,840 --> 01:56:22,840
That is, three minus two t is either less than negative four, or three minus two t is bigger than

1078
01:56:22,840 --> 01:56:28,920
four. I'll solve these two inequalities separately. The first one subtracting three from both sides,

1079
01:56:28,920 --> 01:56:36,680
I get negative two t is less than negative seven, dividing by negative two, I get t is

1080
01:56:36,680 --> 01:56:43,720
bigger than seven halves. And then on the other side, I get negative two t is greater than one.

1081
01:56:43,720 --> 01:56:50,840
So t is less than negative one half. I had to flip inequalities in the last step

1082
01:56:50,920 --> 01:56:55,720
due to dividing by a negative number. So let's check this out on the number line again.

1083
01:56:56,360 --> 01:57:03,400
The first piece says that t is greater than seven halves. I'll draw that over here.

1084
01:57:05,000 --> 01:57:11,640
And the second piece says that t is less than negative one half. I'll draw that down here.

1085
01:57:14,600 --> 01:57:19,800
Because these two statements are joined with an or, I'm looking for the t values

1086
01:57:19,800 --> 01:57:25,400
that are in this one, or in this one. That is, I want both of these regions put together.

1087
01:57:26,120 --> 01:57:32,680
So an interval notation, this reads negative infinity to negative one half soft bracket union

1088
01:57:33,240 --> 01:57:39,640
soft bracket seven halves to infinity. This last example looks more complicated.

1089
01:57:39,640 --> 01:57:45,400
But if I simplify first and isolate the absolute value part, it looks pretty much like the previous

1090
01:57:45,400 --> 01:57:52,200
ones. So I'll start by subtracting seven from both sides. And then I'll divide both sides by two.

1091
01:57:53,000 --> 01:58:00,840
Now I'll draw my number line. And I'm looking for this expression for x plus five to always have

1092
01:58:00,840 --> 01:58:07,000
distance greater than or equal to negative three from zero. Wait a second distance greater than

1093
01:58:07,000 --> 01:58:10,600
equal to negative three. Well distance is always greater than or equal to negative three, it's

1094
01:58:10,600 --> 01:58:19,160
always greater than or equal to zero. So this in fact is always true. And so the answer to my

1095
01:58:19,160 --> 01:58:27,240
inequality is all numbers between negative infinity and infinity. In other words, all real numbers.

1096
01:58:29,560 --> 01:58:33,160
When solving absolute value inequalities, it's good to think about distance.

1097
01:58:34,120 --> 01:58:42,040
An absolute value of something that's less than a number means that whatever's inside the absolute

1098
01:58:42,040 --> 01:58:50,600
value signs is close to zero. On the other hand, an absolute value of something being greater than

1099
01:58:50,600 --> 01:58:57,000
a number means that whatever's inside the absolute value sign is far away from zero.

1100
01:58:57,000 --> 01:59:04,760
Because its distance from zero is bigger than a certain number. Drawing these pictures on the

1101
01:59:04,760 --> 01:59:11,160
number line is a helpful way to rewrite the absolute value inequality as an inequality that

1102
01:59:11,160 --> 01:59:17,400
doesn't contain an absolute value sign. In this case, it would be negative three is less than x

1103
01:59:17,400 --> 01:59:24,920
plus two is less than three. And the other case, it would be either x plus two is less than negative

1104
01:59:24,920 --> 01:59:32,840
three or x plus two is greater than three. This video is about solving linear inequalities.

1105
01:59:32,840 --> 01:59:39,800
Those are inequalities like this one that involve a variable here x, but don't involve any x squared

1106
01:59:39,800 --> 01:59:46,360
or other higher power terms. The good news is, we can solve linear inequalities just like we'd

1107
01:59:46,360 --> 01:59:52,520
solve linear equations by distributing, adding and subtracting terms to both sides and multiplying

1108
01:59:52,520 --> 01:59:57,960
and dividing by numbers on both sides. The only thing that's different is that if you

1109
01:59:58,600 --> 02:00:04,920
multiply or divide by a negative number, then you need to reverse the direction of the inequality.

1110
02:00:05,800 --> 02:00:11,800
For example, if we had the inequality negative x is less than negative five, and we wanted to

1111
02:00:11,800 --> 02:00:19,000
multiply both sides by negative one to get rid of the negative signs, we'd have to also switch

1112
02:00:19,000 --> 02:00:24,120
or reverse the inequality. With this caution in mind, let's look at our first example.

1113
02:00:25,400 --> 02:00:30,360
Since our variable x is trapped in parentheses, I'll distribute the negative five to free it from

1114
02:00:30,360 --> 02:00:36,600
the parentheses. That gives me negative five x minus 10 plus three is greater than eight.

1115
02:00:38,360 --> 02:00:44,360
Negative 10 plus three is negative seven. So I'll rewrite this as negative five x minus seven is

1116
02:00:44,360 --> 02:00:51,880
greater than eight. Now I'll add seven to both sides to get negative five x is greater than 15.

1117
02:00:52,840 --> 02:00:58,520
Now I'd like to divide both sides by negative five, since negative five is a negative number

1118
02:00:58,520 --> 02:01:06,280
that reverses the inequality. So I get x is less than 15 divided by negative five. In other words,

1119
02:01:06,280 --> 02:01:13,320
x is less than negative three. If I wanted to graph this on a number line, I just need to put down

1120
02:01:13,320 --> 02:01:20,760
a negative three, an open circle around it, and shade into the left. I use an open circle

1121
02:01:20,760 --> 02:01:26,280
because x is strictly less than negative three and can't equal negative three. If I wanted to

1122
02:01:26,280 --> 02:01:31,640
write this in interval notation, I've read it as soft bracket, negative infinity, negative three,

1123
02:01:31,640 --> 02:01:36,760
soft bracket. Again, the soft bracket is because the negative three is not included.

1124
02:01:37,720 --> 02:01:45,240
This next example is an example of a compound inequality. It has two parts. Either this statement

1125
02:01:45,240 --> 02:01:50,920
is true or this statement is true. I want to find the values of x that satisfy either one.

1126
02:01:51,880 --> 02:01:56,600
I'll solve this by working out each part separately and then combining them at the end.

1127
02:01:57,480 --> 02:02:03,720
For the inequality on the left, I'll copy it over here. I'm going to add four to both sides,

1128
02:02:04,680 --> 02:02:11,640
then subtract x from both sides, and then divide both sides by two.

1129
02:02:13,960 --> 02:02:17,640
I didn't have to reverse the inequality sign because I divided by a positive number.

1130
02:02:18,840 --> 02:02:25,720
On the right side, I'll copy the equation over, subtract one from both sides, and divide both

1131
02:02:25,720 --> 02:02:33,160
sides by six. Nine, six is the same as three halves. Now I'm looking for the x values that make

1132
02:02:33,160 --> 02:02:38,840
this statement true or make this statement true. Let me graph this on a number line.

1133
02:02:41,000 --> 02:02:48,280
x is less than or equal to negative two means I put a filled in circle there and graph everything

1134
02:02:48,280 --> 02:02:57,080
to the left. x is greater than three halves means I put an empty circle here and shade in everything

1135
02:02:57,080 --> 02:03:06,600
to the right. My final answer includes both of these pieces, which I'll reshade in green because

1136
02:03:06,600 --> 02:03:11,960
x is allowed to be in either one or the other. Finally, I can write this in interval notation.

1137
02:03:12,680 --> 02:03:17,560
The first piece on the number line can be described as soft bracket negative infinity

1138
02:03:18,280 --> 02:03:25,640
negative two hard bracket. And the second piece can be described as soft bracket three halves

1139
02:03:25,640 --> 02:03:33,080
infinity soft bracket. To indicate that x can be in either one of these pieces, I use the union sign,

1140
02:03:33,080 --> 02:03:41,240
which is a U. That means that my answer includes all x values in here together with all x values in

1141
02:03:41,240 --> 02:03:48,760
here. This next example is also a compound inequality, this time joined by an and the and

1142
02:03:48,760 --> 02:03:55,880
means I'm looking for all y values that satisfy both this and this at the same time. Again,

1143
02:03:55,880 --> 02:04:04,840
I can solve each piece separately. On the left, to isolate the y, I need to multiply by negative

1144
02:04:04,840 --> 02:04:13,400
three halves on both sides. So that gives me y is less than negative 12 times negative three halves,

1145
02:04:13,400 --> 02:04:19,720
the greater than flipped to a less than because I was multiplying by negative three halves,

1146
02:04:19,720 --> 02:04:26,680
which is a negative number. If I clean up the right side to get y is less than 18.

1147
02:04:27,080 --> 02:04:34,760
On the right side, I'll start by subtracting two from both sides. And now I'll divide by negative

1148
02:04:34,760 --> 02:04:43,400
four, again, a negative number so that flips the inequality. So that's y is less than three over

1149
02:04:43,400 --> 02:04:49,800
negative four, in other words, y is less than negative three fourths. Again, I'm looking for the y

1150
02:04:50,760 --> 02:04:57,800
values that make both of these statements true at the same time. Let me graph this on the number line.

1151
02:05:00,840 --> 02:05:07,080
The y is less than 18. I can graph that by drawing the number 18.

1152
02:05:08,680 --> 02:05:13,080
I don't want to include it. So I use an empty circle and I shaded everything to the left.

1153
02:05:13,400 --> 02:05:19,480
The statement y is less than negative three fourths, I need to draw in negative three fourths.

1154
02:05:19,480 --> 02:05:27,560
And again, I don't include it, but I do include everything on the left. Since I want the y values

1155
02:05:27,560 --> 02:05:33,400
for which both of these statements are true, I need the y values that are in both colored blue

1156
02:05:33,400 --> 02:05:40,120
and colored red. And so that would be this part right here. I'll just draw it above so you can

1157
02:05:40,120 --> 02:05:47,480
see it easily. So that would be all the numbers from negative three fourths and lower, not including

1158
02:05:47,480 --> 02:05:52,040
negative three fourths. Since those are the parts of the number line that have both red and blue

1159
02:05:52,040 --> 02:05:57,880
colors on them. In interval notation, my final answer will be soft bracket negative infinity

1160
02:05:58,520 --> 02:06:05,320
to negative three fourths soft bracket. As my final example, I have an inequality

1161
02:06:05,880 --> 02:06:11,400
that has two inequality signs in it negative three is less than or equal to six x minus two is less

1162
02:06:11,400 --> 02:06:18,280
than 10. I can think of this as being a compound inequality with two parts negative three x is

1163
02:06:18,280 --> 02:06:25,400
less than or equal to six x minus two. And at the same time, six x minus two is less than 10.

1164
02:06:26,200 --> 02:06:31,960
I could solve this in two pieces as before. But instead, it's a little more efficient to just solve

1165
02:06:32,040 --> 02:06:40,280
it all at once by doing the same thing to all three sides. So as a first step, I'll add two to

1166
02:06:40,280 --> 02:06:47,400
all three sides. That gives me negative one is less than equal to six x is less than 12. And now

1167
02:06:47,400 --> 02:06:53,720
I'm going to divide all three sides by six to isolate the x. So that gives me negative one six

1168
02:06:53,720 --> 02:07:00,760
is less than or equal to x is less than two. If we'd solved it instead in two pieces above,

1169
02:07:00,840 --> 02:07:06,040
we'd end up with the same thing. Because we get negative one six is less than or equal to x from

1170
02:07:06,040 --> 02:07:12,680
this piece. And we get x is less than two on this piece. And because of the and statement, that's

1171
02:07:12,680 --> 02:07:17,160
the same thing as saying negative one six is less than or equal to x, which is less than two.

1172
02:07:18,600 --> 02:07:24,280
Either way we do it. Let's see if what it looks like on the number line. So on the number line,

1173
02:07:24,280 --> 02:07:33,800
we're looking for things that are between two and negative one six, including the negative one six,

1174
02:07:33,800 --> 02:07:39,960
but not including the two. In interval notation, we can write this as hard bracket negative one six

1175
02:07:40,520 --> 02:07:47,800
to soft bracket. In this video, we solved linear inequalities, including some compound inequalities

1176
02:07:47,800 --> 02:07:55,000
joined by the conjunctions and and or. Remember, when we're working with and we're looking for

1177
02:07:55,000 --> 02:08:01,800
places on the number line, where both statements are true. That is, we're looking for the overlap

1178
02:08:01,800 --> 02:08:09,240
on the number line. In this case, the points on the number line that are colored both red and blue

1179
02:08:09,240 --> 02:08:15,880
at the same time. When we're working with or statements, we're looking for places where

1180
02:08:15,880 --> 02:08:21,000
either one or the other statement is true or both. On the number line,

1181
02:08:22,760 --> 02:08:28,520
this corresponds to points that are colored either red or blue or both. And in this picture,

1182
02:08:28,520 --> 02:08:34,920
that would actually correspond to the entire number line. In this video, we'll solve inequalities

1183
02:08:34,920 --> 02:08:40,920
involving polynomials like this one, and inequalities involving rational expressions like this one.

1184
02:08:41,800 --> 02:08:48,520
Let's start with a simple example, maybe a deceptively simple example. If you see the inequality

1185
02:08:48,520 --> 02:08:54,760
x squared is less than four, you might be very tempted to take the square root of both sides and

1186
02:08:54,760 --> 02:09:00,920
get something like x is less than two as your answer. But in fact, that doesn't work.

1187
02:09:01,320 --> 02:09:11,480
To see why it's not correct, consider the x value of negative 10. Negative 10 satisfies

1188
02:09:12,680 --> 02:09:20,520
the inequality x is less than two, since negative 10 is less than two, but it doesn't satisfy the

1189
02:09:20,520 --> 02:09:28,920
inequality x squared is less than four, since negative 10 squared is 100, which is not less than

1190
02:09:28,920 --> 02:09:36,200
four. So these two inequalities are not the same. And it doesn't work to solve a quadratic

1191
02:09:36,200 --> 02:09:41,480
inequality just to take the square root of both sides. You might be thinking part of why this

1192
02:09:41,480 --> 02:09:47,400
reasoning is wrong is we've ignored the negative two option, right? If we had the equation x squared

1193
02:09:47,400 --> 02:09:53,640
equals four, then x equals two would just be one option, x equals negative two would be another

1194
02:09:53,640 --> 02:09:59,320
solution. So somehow our solution to this inequality should take this into account.

1195
02:10:00,440 --> 02:10:06,120
In fact, a good way to solve an inequality involving x squared or higher power terms

1196
02:10:06,120 --> 02:10:12,360
is to solve the associated equation first. But before we even do that, I like to pull

1197
02:10:12,360 --> 02:10:16,680
everything over to one side so that my inequality has zero on the other side.

1198
02:10:17,000 --> 02:10:22,680
So for our equation, I'll subtract four from both sides to get x squared minus four is less than

1199
02:10:22,680 --> 02:10:30,200
zero. Now, I'm going to actually solve the associated equation, x squared minus four is equal

1200
02:10:30,200 --> 02:10:39,080
to zero. I can do this by factoring to x minus two times x plus two is equal to zero. And I'll set

1201
02:10:39,560 --> 02:10:45,560
my factors equal to zero, and I get x equals two and x equals minus two.

1202
02:10:47,000 --> 02:10:52,520
Now, I'm going to plot the solutions to my equation on the number line. So I write down negative two

1203
02:10:52,520 --> 02:10:58,040
and two. Those are the places where my expression x squared minus four is equal to zero.

1204
02:10:59,800 --> 02:11:04,440
Since I want to find where x squared minus four is less than zero, I want to know where

1205
02:11:04,440 --> 02:11:10,120
this expression x squared minus four is positive or negative. A good way to find that out is to

1206
02:11:10,120 --> 02:11:16,680
plug in test values. So first I'll plug in a test value in this area of the number line,

1207
02:11:17,240 --> 02:11:23,720
something less than negative two say x equals negative three. If I plug in negative three

1208
02:11:23,720 --> 02:11:30,600
into x squared minus four, I get negative three squared minus four, which is nine minus four,

1209
02:11:30,600 --> 02:11:37,960
which is five. That's a positive number. So at negative three, the expression x squared minus

1210
02:11:37,960 --> 02:11:43,800
four is positive. And in fact, everywhere on this region of the number line, my expression is going

1211
02:11:43,800 --> 02:11:48,760
to be positive, because it can't jump from positive to negative without going through a place where

1212
02:11:48,760 --> 02:11:54,680
it's zero. I can figure out whether x squared minus four is positive or negative on this region,

1213
02:11:54,680 --> 02:11:58,520
and on this region of the number line, by plugging in test values similarly.

1214
02:11:59,800 --> 02:12:06,040
A value to plug in between negative two and two, a nice value is x equals zero, zero squared minus

1215
02:12:06,040 --> 02:12:11,240
four, that's negative four, a negative number. So I know that my expression x squared minus four

1216
02:12:11,240 --> 02:12:17,720
is negative on this whole interval. Finally, I can plug in something like x equals 10, something

1217
02:12:17,720 --> 02:12:24,280
bigger than two, and I get 10 squared minus four. Without even computing that, I can tell that that's

1218
02:12:24,280 --> 02:12:29,000
going to be a positive number. And that's all that's important. Again, since I want x squared

1219
02:12:29,000 --> 02:12:33,800
minus four to be less than zero, I'm looking for the places on this number line, where I'm getting

1220
02:12:33,800 --> 02:12:40,280
negatives. So I'll shade that in on my number line, it's in here, not including the endpoints,

1221
02:12:40,280 --> 02:12:44,680
because the endpoints are where my expression x squared minus four is equal to zero, and I want

1222
02:12:44,680 --> 02:12:51,880
it strictly less than zero. I can write my answer as an inequality, negative two is less than x is

1223
02:12:51,960 --> 02:12:58,120
less than two, or an interval notation as soft bracket negative two to soft bracket.

1224
02:12:59,800 --> 02:13:05,640
Our next example, we can solve similarly. First, we'll move everything to one side,

1225
02:13:06,440 --> 02:13:13,800
so that our inequality is x cubed minus five x squared minus six x is greater than or equal to

1226
02:13:13,800 --> 02:13:22,200
zero. Next, we'll solve the associated equation by factoring. So first, I'll write down the equation.

1227
02:13:23,000 --> 02:13:30,680
Now I'll factor out an x. And now I'll factor the quadratic. So the solutions to my equation

1228
02:13:30,680 --> 02:13:37,080
are x equals zero x equals six and x equals negative one. I'll write the solutions to the

1229
02:13:37,080 --> 02:13:49,720
equation on the number line. So that's negative one, zero, and six. That's where my expression x times

1230
02:13:49,720 --> 02:13:59,960
x minus six times x plus one is equal to zero. But I want to find where it's greater than or equal

1231
02:13:59,960 --> 02:14:07,080
to zero. So again, I can use test values. I can plug in, for example, x equals negative two,

1232
02:14:07,080 --> 02:14:12,840
either to this version of expression, or to this factored version. Since I only care whether my

1233
02:14:12,840 --> 02:14:17,720
answer is positive or negative, it's sometimes easier to use the factored version. For example,

1234
02:14:17,720 --> 02:14:27,400
when x is negative two, this factor is negative. But this factor x minus six is also negative

1235
02:14:27,400 --> 02:14:35,720
when I plug in negative two for x. Finally, x plus one, when I plug in negative two for x,

1236
02:14:35,720 --> 02:14:40,280
that's negative one, that's also negative. And a negative times a negative times a negative

1237
02:14:40,280 --> 02:14:48,600
gives me a negative number. If I plug in something between negative one and zero, say x equals negative

1238
02:14:48,600 --> 02:14:54,920
one half, then I'm going to get a negative for this factor, a negative for this factor,

1239
02:14:54,920 --> 02:15:01,560
but a positive for this third factor. Negative times negative times positive gives me a positive.

1240
02:15:03,240 --> 02:15:11,800
For a test value between zero and six, let's try x equals one. Now I'll get a positive for

1241
02:15:11,800 --> 02:15:19,080
this factor, a negative for this factor, and a positive for this factor. Positive times a negative

1242
02:15:19,080 --> 02:15:26,200
times a positive gives me a negative. Finally, for a test value bigger than six, we could use

1243
02:15:26,200 --> 02:15:35,000
say x equals 100. That's going to give me positive, positive, positive. So my product will be positive.

1244
02:15:37,160 --> 02:15:42,760
Since I want values where my expression is greater than or equal to zero, I want the places where it

1245
02:15:42,760 --> 02:15:54,520
equals zero and the places where it's positive. So my final answer will be close bracket negative

1246
02:15:54,520 --> 02:16:03,240
one to zero close bracket union close bracket six to infinity. As our final example, let's consider

1247
02:16:03,240 --> 02:16:10,760
the rational inequality x squared plus six x plus nine divided by x minus one is less than or equal

1248
02:16:10,760 --> 02:16:17,400
to zero. Although it might be tempting to clear the denominator and multiply both sides by x minus

1249
02:16:17,400 --> 02:16:23,720
one, it's dangerous to do that, because x minus one could be a positive number, but it could also

1250
02:16:23,720 --> 02:16:28,360
be a negative number. And when you multiply both sides by a negative number, you have to reverse

1251
02:16:28,360 --> 02:16:35,000
the inequality. Although it's possible to solve the inequality this way by thinking of cases where

1252
02:16:35,000 --> 02:16:40,280
x minus one is less than zero or better than zero, I think it's much easier just to solve the same

1253
02:16:40,280 --> 02:16:47,240
way as we did before. So we'll start by rewriting so that we move all terms to the left and have zero

1254
02:16:47,240 --> 02:16:53,560
on the right. Well, that's already true. So the next step would be to solve the associated equation.

1255
02:16:56,120 --> 02:17:01,800
That is x squared plus six x plus nine over x minus one is equal to zero.

1256
02:17:02,520 --> 02:17:09,080
That would be where the numerator zero x squared plus six x plus nine is equal to zero. So where x plus

1257
02:17:09,080 --> 02:17:16,840
three squared is zero or x equals negative three. There's one extra step we have to do for rational

1258
02:17:16,840 --> 02:17:23,080
expressions. And that's what we need to find where the expression does not exist. That is,

1259
02:17:23,080 --> 02:17:30,360
let's find where the denominator is zero and that's at x equals one. I'll put all those numbers on

1260
02:17:30,760 --> 02:17:37,160
the number line, the places where my rational expression is equal to zero, and the place where

1261
02:17:37,160 --> 02:17:44,120
my rational expression doesn't exist. Then I can start in with test values. For example, x equals

1262
02:17:44,120 --> 02:17:54,200
minus four, zero and two work. If I plug those values into this expression here, I get a negative

1263
02:17:54,280 --> 02:17:59,960
answer, a negative answer and a positive answer. The reason I need to conclude the values on my

1264
02:17:59,960 --> 02:18:06,520
number line where my denominator zero is because I can my expression can switch from negative to

1265
02:18:06,520 --> 02:18:12,920
positive by passing through a place where my rational expression doesn't exist, as well as

1266
02:18:12,920 --> 02:18:18,280
passing by passing through a place where my rational expression is equal to zero. Now I'm

1267
02:18:18,280 --> 02:18:23,800
looking for where my original expression was less than or equal to zero. So that means I want the

1268
02:18:23,800 --> 02:18:31,080
places on the number line where my expression is equal to zero, and also the places where it's

1269
02:18:31,080 --> 02:18:40,360
negative. So my final answer is x is less than one or an interval notation negative infinity to one.

1270
02:18:42,280 --> 02:18:48,200
In this video, we solved polynomial and rational inequalities by making a number line

1271
02:18:48,200 --> 02:18:56,040
and using test values to make a sign chart. The distance formula can be used to find the

1272
02:18:56,040 --> 02:19:03,640
distance between two points if we know their coordinates. If this first point has coordinates

1273
02:19:03,640 --> 02:19:12,040
x one, y one, and the second point has coordinates x two, y two, then the distance between them

1274
02:19:12,040 --> 02:19:21,320
is given by the formula, the square root of x two minus x one squared plus y two minus y one

1275
02:19:21,320 --> 02:19:28,840
squared. This formula actually comes from the Pythagorean theorem. Let me draw a right triangle

1276
02:19:29,400 --> 02:19:32,360
with these two points as two of its vertices.

1277
02:19:32,600 --> 02:19:42,760
Then the length of this side is the difference between the two x coordinates. Similarly, the

1278
02:19:42,760 --> 02:19:49,320
length of this vertical side is the difference between the two y coordinates. Now the Pythagorean

1279
02:19:49,320 --> 02:19:55,960
theorem says that for any right triangle with sides labeled A and B and hypotenuse labeled C,

1280
02:19:56,760 --> 02:20:03,800
we have that A squared plus B squared equals C squared. Well, if we apply that to this triangle

1281
02:20:03,800 --> 02:20:10,200
here, this hypotenuse is the distance between the two points that we're looking for.

1282
02:20:11,640 --> 02:20:20,200
So Pythagorean theorem says the square of this side length, that is x two minus x one squared

1283
02:20:20,920 --> 02:20:27,800
plus the square of this side length, which is y two minus y one squared

1284
02:20:28,600 --> 02:20:36,920
has to equal the square of the hypotenuse, that is D squared. Taking the square root of both sides

1285
02:20:36,920 --> 02:20:44,360
of this equation, we get the square root of x two minus x one squared plus y two minus y one

1286
02:20:44,360 --> 02:20:50,680
squared is equal to D. We don't have to worry about using plus or minus signs when we take the

1287
02:20:50,680 --> 02:20:57,960
square root because distance is always positive. So we've derived our distance formula. Now let's

1288
02:20:57,960 --> 02:21:07,320
use it in an example. Let's find the distance between the two points negative one five, negative one

1289
02:21:07,560 --> 02:21:17,880
five, maybe over here, and four two. This notation just means that P is the point with

1290
02:21:17,880 --> 02:21:23,960
coordinates negative one five. And Q is the point with coordinates four two.

1291
02:21:26,360 --> 02:21:33,640
We have the distance formula. Let's think of P being the point with coordinates x one y one

1292
02:21:33,640 --> 02:21:40,520
and Q being the point with coordinates x two y two. But as we'll see, it really doesn't matter

1293
02:21:40,520 --> 02:21:50,680
which one is which. Plugging into our formula, we get D is the square root of x two minus x one.

1294
02:21:50,680 --> 02:22:07,320
So that's four minus negative one squared. And then we add y two minus y one. So that's two minus

1295
02:22:07,320 --> 02:22:15,240
five squared. Working out the arithmetic a little bit four minus negative one, that's four plus one

1296
02:22:15,240 --> 02:22:22,840
or five squared plus negative three squared. So that's the square root of 25 plus nine,

1297
02:22:22,840 --> 02:22:29,880
or the square root of 34. Let's see what would have happened if we'd called this first point

1298
02:22:30,760 --> 02:22:38,360
x two y two instead and the second point x one y one. Then we would have gotten the same distance

1299
02:22:38,360 --> 02:22:49,400
formula. But we would have taken negative one minus four. And added the difference of y squared.

1300
02:22:49,400 --> 02:22:58,920
So that's y two five minus two squared. So that gives us the square root of negative five squared

1301
02:22:58,920 --> 02:23:07,560
plus three squared, which works out to the same thing. In this video, we use the distance formula

1302
02:23:07,560 --> 02:23:12,520
to find the distance between two points. When writing down the distance formula, sometimes

1303
02:23:12,520 --> 02:23:17,480
students forget whether this is a plus or minus and whether these are pluses or minuses. One way

1304
02:23:17,480 --> 02:23:22,440
to remember is to think that the distance formula comes from the Pythagorean theorem. That's why

1305
02:23:22,440 --> 02:23:29,560
there's a plus in here. And then a minus in here because we're getting the difference between the

1306
02:23:29,560 --> 02:23:35,960
coordinates to find the lengths of the sides. The midpoint formula helps us find the coordinates

1307
02:23:35,960 --> 02:23:41,800
of the midpoint of a line segment, as long as we know the coordinates of the endpoints.

1308
02:23:43,400 --> 02:23:49,400
So let's call the coordinates of this endpoint x one y one, and the coordinates of this other

1309
02:23:49,400 --> 02:23:58,600
endpoint x two y two. The x coordinate of the midpoint is going to be exactly halfway in between

1310
02:23:58,600 --> 02:24:04,200
the x coordinates of the endpoints. To get a number halfway in between two other numbers,

1311
02:24:04,200 --> 02:24:05,400
we just take the average.

1312
02:24:10,360 --> 02:24:15,880
Similarly, the y coordinate of this midpoint is going to be exactly halfway in between

1313
02:24:15,880 --> 02:24:21,480
the y coordinates of the endpoints. So the y coordinate of the midpoint is going to be the

1314
02:24:21,480 --> 02:24:29,160
average of those y coordinates. So we see that the coordinates of the midpoint

1315
02:24:30,120 --> 02:24:35,960
are x one plus x two over two, y one plus y two over two.

1316
02:24:37,560 --> 02:24:44,760
Let's use this midpoint formula in an example. We want to find the midpoint of the segment

1317
02:24:44,760 --> 02:24:54,920
between the points negative one, five, and four, two.

1318
02:24:57,640 --> 02:25:03,160
Let me draw the line segment between them. So visually the midpoint is going to be somewhere

1319
02:25:03,160 --> 02:25:09,800
around here. But to find its exact coordinates, we're going to use x one plus x two over two,

1320
02:25:09,800 --> 02:25:15,080
and y one plus y two over two, where this first point is coordinates

1321
02:25:16,280 --> 02:25:23,320
x one y one. And the second point has coordinates x two y two. It doesn't actually matter which

1322
02:25:23,320 --> 02:25:28,040
point you decide is x one y one and which one is x two y two. The formula will still give you

1323
02:25:28,040 --> 02:25:35,160
the same answer for the midpoint. So let's see I take my average of my x coordinates. So that's

1324
02:25:36,120 --> 02:25:44,280
negative one plus four over two, and the average of my y coordinates. So that's five plus two over

1325
02:25:44,280 --> 02:25:55,080
two. And I get three halves, seven halves, as the coordinates of my midpoint. In this video,

1326
02:25:55,080 --> 02:26:00,360
we use the midpoint formula to find the midpoint of a line segment, just by taking the average

1327
02:26:00,440 --> 02:26:05,640
of the x coordinates and the average of the y coordinates. This video is about graphs and

1328
02:26:05,640 --> 02:26:13,560
equations of circles. Suppose we want to find the equation of a circle of radius five centered at the

1329
02:26:13,560 --> 02:26:25,720
point three two. It'll look something like this. For any point x y on the circle, we know that

1330
02:26:25,880 --> 02:26:33,080
that the distance of that point x y from the center is equal to the radius, that is five.

1331
02:26:34,200 --> 02:26:41,240
From the distance formula, that distance of five is equal to the square root of the difference of

1332
02:26:41,240 --> 02:26:52,040
the x coordinates. That's x minus three squared, plus the difference of the y coordinates, that's

1333
02:26:52,040 --> 02:27:03,720
y minus two squared. And if I square both sides of that equation, I get five squared is this square

1334
02:27:03,720 --> 02:27:13,160
root squared. In other words, 25 is equal to x minus three squared plus y minus two squared,

1335
02:27:13,160 --> 02:27:20,360
since the square root and the squared undo each other. A lot of times people will write the x minus

1336
02:27:20,360 --> 02:27:25,880
three squared plus y minus two squared on the left side of the equation and the 25 on the right

1337
02:27:25,880 --> 02:27:32,600
side of the equation. This is the standard form for the equation of this circle. The same reasoning

1338
02:27:32,600 --> 02:27:39,000
can be generalized to find the general equation for a circle with radius r centered at a point hk.

1339
02:27:40,680 --> 02:27:48,840
For any point with coordinates x y on the circle, the distance between the point with coordinates

1340
02:27:48,840 --> 02:27:56,920
x y and the point with coordinates hk is equal to the radius r. So we have that the distance

1341
02:27:56,920 --> 02:28:03,240
is equal to r, but by the distance formula, that's the square root of the difference between the x

1342
02:28:03,240 --> 02:28:12,760
coordinates, x minus h squared, plus the difference in the y coordinates, y minus k squared.

1343
02:28:12,760 --> 02:28:23,000
Squaring both sides as before, we get r squared is the square root squared, canceling the square root

1344
02:28:23,000 --> 02:28:31,240
and the squared and rearranging the equation that gives us x minus h squared plus y minus k squared

1345
02:28:31,240 --> 02:28:38,760
equals r squared. That's the general formula for a circle with radius r and center hk.

1346
02:28:38,760 --> 02:28:47,240
Notice that the coordinates h and k are subtracted here. The two squares are added because they are

1347
02:28:47,240 --> 02:28:53,000
in the distance formula and the radius is squared on the other side. If you remember this general

1348
02:28:53,000 --> 02:28:58,920
formula, that makes it easy to write down the equation for a circle. For example, if we want the

1349
02:28:58,920 --> 02:29:12,680
equation for a circle of radius six and center at zero negative three, then we have r equals six

1350
02:29:13,320 --> 02:29:25,880
and hk is our zero negative three. So plugging into the formula, we get x minus zero squared plus

1351
02:29:25,880 --> 02:29:35,160
y minus negative three squared equals six squared, or simplified, this is x squared plus y plus three

1352
02:29:35,160 --> 02:29:43,160
squared equals 36. Suppose we're given an equation like this one, and we want to decide if it's the

1353
02:29:43,160 --> 02:29:50,120
equation of a circle. And if so, what's the center and what's the radius? Well, this equation matches

1354
02:29:50,120 --> 02:29:57,000
the form for a circle x minus h squared plus y minus k squared equals r squared.

1355
02:29:57,000 --> 02:30:05,240
If we let h be five, y be negative six, since that way, subtracting a negative six is like

1356
02:30:05,240 --> 02:30:13,560
adding a six. Five must be our r squared. So that means that r is the square root of five.

1357
02:30:14,360 --> 02:30:23,000
So this is our radius. And our center is the point five negative six. And this is indeed

1358
02:30:23,000 --> 02:30:29,000
the equation for a circle, which we could then graph by putting down the center

1359
02:30:30,040 --> 02:30:33,160
and estimating the radius, which is a little bit more than two.

1360
02:30:36,520 --> 02:30:41,640
This equation might not look like the equation of a circle, but it actually can be transformed

1361
02:30:42,360 --> 02:30:47,640
to look like the equation of a circle. We're trying to make it look like something of the form

1362
02:30:47,640 --> 02:30:55,640
x minus h squared plus y minus k squared equals r squared. First, I'd like to get rid of the

1363
02:30:55,640 --> 02:30:59,880
coefficients in front of the x squared and the y squared. So I'm going to divide everything by nine.

1364
02:31:00,760 --> 02:31:09,800
This gives me x squared plus y squared plus eight x minus two y plus four equals zero. Next,

1365
02:31:09,800 --> 02:31:15,480
I'm going to group the x terms together, the x squared and the eight x. So I'll write x squared

1366
02:31:15,480 --> 02:31:20,440
plus eight x. I'll group the y terms together, the y squared minus two y.

1367
02:31:22,600 --> 02:31:26,280
And I'll subtract the four over to the other side.

1368
02:31:28,360 --> 02:31:32,520
This still doesn't look much like the equation of a circle. But as the next step,

1369
02:31:32,520 --> 02:31:37,240
I'm going to do something called completing the square. I'm going to take this coefficient

1370
02:31:37,240 --> 02:31:45,080
of x eight, divide it by two and then square it. In other words, eight over two squared,

1371
02:31:45,080 --> 02:31:51,080
that's four squared, which is 16. I'm going to add 16 to both sides of my equation.

1372
02:31:52,920 --> 02:32:00,680
So add the 16 here. And on the other side. Now I'm going to do the same thing to the

1373
02:32:00,680 --> 02:32:09,560
coefficient of y negative two divided by two is negative one square that and I get one. So now I'm

1374
02:32:09,560 --> 02:32:17,000
going to add a one to both sides, but I'll put it near the y terms. So add a one there. And then

1375
02:32:17,000 --> 02:32:22,520
to keep things balanced, I have to add it to the other side. On the right side, I have the number

1376
02:32:22,520 --> 02:32:29,640
13. On the left side, I can wrap up this expression x squared plus eight x plus 16

1377
02:32:30,440 --> 02:32:39,640
into x plus four squared. To convince you that's correct. If we multiply out x plus four times x

1378
02:32:39,640 --> 02:32:48,360
plus four, we get x squared plus four x plus four x plus 16, or x squared plus eight x plus 16,

1379
02:32:48,360 --> 02:32:56,920
the same thing we have right here. Similarly, we can wrap up y squared minus two y plus one as

1380
02:32:58,840 --> 02:33:06,440
y minus one squared. Again, I'll work out the distribution down here. That's y squared minus

1381
02:33:06,440 --> 02:33:12,040
y minus y plus one or y squared minus two y plus one, just like we have up here.

1382
02:33:12,440 --> 02:33:20,360
If you're wondering how I knew to use four and minus one, the four came from taking half of eight,

1383
02:33:20,360 --> 02:33:26,760
and the minus one came from taking half the negative two. Now we have an equation for a

1384
02:33:26,760 --> 02:33:34,840
circle in standard form. And we can read off the center, which is negative four, negative one,

1385
02:33:35,480 --> 02:33:45,640
and the radius, which is the square root of 13. It might seem like magic that this trick of taking

1386
02:33:45,640 --> 02:33:51,080
half of this coefficient and squaring it and adding it to both sides, let's us wrap up this

1387
02:33:51,080 --> 02:33:57,080
expression into this expression, that's perfect square. But to see why that works, let's take a

1388
02:33:57,080 --> 02:34:03,560
look at what happens if we expand out x minus h squared, the thing that we're trying to get to.

1389
02:34:05,400 --> 02:34:13,480
So if we expand that out, x minus h squared, which is x minus h times x minus h is,

1390
02:34:14,360 --> 02:34:24,520
which multiplies out to x squared minus hx minus hx plus h squared, or x squared minus two hx plus

1391
02:34:24,520 --> 02:34:33,720
h squared. Now if we start out with this part, with some x squared term and some coefficient of x,

1392
02:34:33,720 --> 02:34:39,320
and we're trying to decide what to add on in order to wrap it up into x minus h squared,

1393
02:34:39,320 --> 02:34:46,440
the thing to add on is h squared here, which comes from half of this coefficient squared,

1394
02:34:46,440 --> 02:34:51,880
right, because half of negative two h is eight negative h, square that you get the h squared.

1395
02:34:51,880 --> 02:34:59,240
And then when we do wrap it up, it's half of this coefficient of x that appears right here.

1396
02:34:59,240 --> 02:35:04,840
This trick of completing the square is really handy for turning an equation for a circle in

1397
02:35:04,840 --> 02:35:10,920
disguise into the standard equation for the circle. In this video, we found the standard

1398
02:35:10,920 --> 02:35:19,080
equation for a circle, x minus h squared plus y minus k squared equals r squared, where r is the

1399
02:35:19,080 --> 02:35:30,680
radius, and hk is the center. We also showed a method of completing the square. When you have

1400
02:35:30,680 --> 02:35:37,720
an equation for a circle in disguise, completing the square will help you rewrite it into the standard

1401
02:35:37,720 --> 02:35:46,840
form. This video is about graphs and equations of lines. Here we're given the graph of a line,

1402
02:35:46,840 --> 02:35:54,360
we want to find the equation. One standard format for the equation of a line is y equals mx plus b.

1403
02:35:55,400 --> 02:36:05,000
Here m represents the slope and b represents the y intercept, the y value where the line crosses

1404
02:36:05,000 --> 02:36:13,720
the y axis. The slope is equal to the rise over the run, or sometimes this is written as the change

1405
02:36:13,720 --> 02:36:23,320
in y values over the change in x values, or in other words, y2 minus y1 over x2 minus x1, where

1406
02:36:24,200 --> 02:36:33,160
x1, y1, and x2, y2 are points on the line. While we could use any two points on the line to find

1407
02:36:33,160 --> 02:36:39,400
the slope, it's convenient to use points where the x and y coordinates are integers, that is

1408
02:36:39,400 --> 02:36:45,800
points where the line passes through grid points. So here would be one convenient point to use,

1409
02:36:45,800 --> 02:36:53,160
and here's another convenient point to use. The coordinates of the first point are one, two,

1410
02:36:53,160 --> 02:37:00,040
and the next point, this is, let's see, five, negative one. Now I can find the slope by looking

1411
02:37:00,040 --> 02:37:08,200
at the rise over the run. So as I go through a run of this distance, I go through a rise of that

1412
02:37:08,200 --> 02:37:13,320
distance, it's actually going to be a negative rise or a fall because my line is pointing down.

1413
02:37:13,320 --> 02:37:18,920
So let's see, counting off squares, this is a run of one, two, three, four squares and a rise of

1414
02:37:19,560 --> 02:37:27,960
one, two, three, so negative three. So my slope is going to be negative three over four.

1415
02:37:29,800 --> 02:37:33,880
I got that answer by counting squares, but I could have also gotten it by

1416
02:37:33,880 --> 02:37:38,200
looking at the difference in my y values over the difference in my x values.

1417
02:37:38,200 --> 02:37:47,080
That is, I could have done negative one minus two, that's from my difference in y values,

1418
02:37:47,080 --> 02:37:56,280
and divide that by my difference in x values, which is five minus one, that gives me negative three

1419
02:37:56,280 --> 02:38:07,000
over four as before. So my m is negative three fourths. Now I need to figure out the value of b,

1420
02:38:07,000 --> 02:38:13,240
my y intercept. Well, I could just read it off the graph, it looks like approximately 2.75,

1421
02:38:13,240 --> 02:38:18,200
but if I want to be more accurate, I can again use a point that has integer coordinates that I know

1422
02:38:18,200 --> 02:38:25,160
its exact coordinates. So either this point or that point, let's try this point. And I can start

1423
02:38:25,160 --> 02:38:33,320
off with my equation y equals mx plus b, that is y equals negative three fourths x plus b,

1424
02:38:33,320 --> 02:38:45,000
and I can plug in the point one two for my x and y. So that gives me two equals negative three fourths

1425
02:38:45,000 --> 02:38:52,360
times one plus b, solving for b, let's see that's two equals negative three fourths plus b,

1426
02:38:52,920 --> 02:38:59,880
so add three fourths to both sides, that's two plus three fourths equals b. So b is

1427
02:39:00,920 --> 02:39:06,440
eight fourths plus three fourths, which is 11 fourths, which is actually just what I eyeballed it

1428
02:39:06,440 --> 02:39:15,160
to be. So now I can write out my final equation for my line y equals negative three fourths x plus

1429
02:39:15,160 --> 02:39:22,280
11 fourths by plugging in for m and b. Next, let's find the equation for this horizontal line.

1430
02:39:23,960 --> 02:39:29,960
A horizontal line has slope zero. So if we think of it as y equals mx plus b,

1431
02:39:30,600 --> 02:39:37,560
m is going to be zero. In other words, it's just y equals b, y is some constant. So if we can figure

1432
02:39:37,560 --> 02:39:44,920
out what that that constant y value is, it looks like it's two, let's see that's three,

1433
02:39:44,920 --> 02:39:49,960
three and a half, we can just write down the equation directly, y equals 3.5.

1434
02:39:52,520 --> 02:39:58,840
For a vertical line, like this one, it doesn't really have a slope. I mean, if you tried to do

1435
02:39:58,840 --> 02:40:05,880
the rise over the run, there's no run. So I guess you'd be dividing by zero and get an infinite slope.

1436
02:40:05,880 --> 02:40:12,600
But but instead, we just think of it as an equation of the form x equals something.

1437
02:40:13,240 --> 02:40:19,320
And in this case, x equals negative two. Notice that all of the points on our line have the same

1438
02:40:19,320 --> 02:40:25,000
x coordinate of negative two and the y coordinate can be anything. So this is how we write the

1439
02:40:25,000 --> 02:40:32,120
equation for a vertical line. In this example, we're not shown a graph of the line, we're just

1440
02:40:32,120 --> 02:40:37,640
told that it goes through two points. But knowing that it goes through two points is enough to find

1441
02:40:37,640 --> 02:40:45,640
the equation for the line. First, we can find the slope by taking the difference in y values

1442
02:40:45,640 --> 02:40:53,400
over the difference in x values. So that's negative three minus two over four minus one,

1443
02:40:53,400 --> 02:41:02,520
which is negative five thirds. So we can use the standard equation for the line,

1444
02:41:02,520 --> 02:41:11,000
this is called the slope intercept form. And we can plug in negative five thirds.

1445
02:41:11,640 --> 02:41:18,120
And we can use one point, either one will do, we'll still get the same final answer. So let's

1446
02:41:18,120 --> 02:41:27,400
use one two and plug that in to get two equals negative five thirds times one plus B. And so B is

1447
02:41:28,280 --> 02:41:35,800
two plus five thirds, which is six thirds plus five thirds, which is 11 thirds. So our equation

1448
02:41:35,800 --> 02:41:47,560
is y equals negative five thirds x plus 11 thirds. This is method one. Method two uses a slightly

1449
02:41:47,640 --> 02:41:54,200
different form of the equation. It's called the point slope form. And it goes y minus y not

1450
02:41:54,200 --> 02:42:04,280
is equal to m times x minus x not, where x not y not is a point on the line. And am again is the

1451
02:42:04,280 --> 02:42:11,080
slope. So we calculate the slope the same way, by taking a difference in y values over difference

1452
02:42:11,080 --> 02:42:22,200
in x values. But then we can simply plug in any point. For example, the point one two will work,

1453
02:42:22,200 --> 02:42:31,320
we can plug one in for x not and two in for y not in this point slope form, that gives us y

1454
02:42:31,640 --> 02:42:41,560
minus two is equal to minus five thirds x minus one. Notice that these two equations while they may

1455
02:42:41,560 --> 02:42:47,880
look different are actually equivalent. Because if I distribute the negative five thirds, and then

1456
02:42:48,040 --> 02:42:50,600
and then add the two to both sides,

1457
02:42:58,920 --> 02:43:01,560
I get the same equation as above.

1458
02:43:05,160 --> 02:43:10,680
So we've seen two ways of finding the equation for the line, using the slope intercept form

1459
02:43:10,760 --> 02:43:19,160
and using the point slope form. In this video, we saw that you can find the equation for a line

1460
02:43:19,160 --> 02:43:27,960
if you know the slope. And you know one point. You can also find the equation for the line if

1461
02:43:27,960 --> 02:43:35,240
you know two points, because you can use the two points to get the slope, and then plug in one of

1462
02:43:35,240 --> 02:43:41,720
those points to figure out the rest of the equation. We saw two standard forms for the

1463
02:43:41,720 --> 02:43:50,360
equation of a line. The slope intercept form y equals mx plus b, where m is the slope, and b is the

1464
02:43:50,360 --> 02:44:01,080
y intercept. And the point slope form y minus y not equals m times x minus x not, where m again

1465
02:44:01,080 --> 02:44:11,240
is the slope, and x not y not is a point on the line. This video is about finding parallel and

1466
02:44:11,240 --> 02:44:19,400
perpendicular lines. Suppose we have a line of slope three fourths, in other words, the rise

1467
02:44:19,640 --> 02:44:30,840
over the run is three over four. Then any other line that's parallel to this line will have the same

1468
02:44:30,840 --> 02:44:40,840
slope, the same rise over run. So that's our first fact to keep in mind. Parallel lines have the same

1469
02:44:40,840 --> 02:44:47,480
slopes. Suppose on the other hand, we want to find a line perpendicular to our original line with

1470
02:44:48,440 --> 02:44:56,920
its original slope of three fourths. A perpendicular line, in other words, a line at a 90 degree

1471
02:44:56,920 --> 02:45:03,560
angle to our original line, will have a slope that's the negative reciprocal, the opposite

1472
02:45:03,560 --> 02:45:10,520
reciprocal of our original slope. So we take the reciprocal of three fourths, that's four thirds,

1473
02:45:10,520 --> 02:45:16,760
and we make it its opposite by changing it from positive to negative. So I'll write this as a

1474
02:45:16,760 --> 02:45:24,760
principle that perpendicular lines have opposite reciprocal slopes. To get the hang of what it

1475
02:45:24,760 --> 02:45:30,760
means to be an opposite reciprocal, let's look at a few examples. So here's the original slope,

1476
02:45:30,760 --> 02:45:36,440
and this will be the opposite reciprocal, which would represent the slope of our perpendicular

1477
02:45:36,440 --> 02:45:43,080
line. So for example, if m1 was two, then the opposite reciprocal, the reciprocal of two is

1478
02:45:43,080 --> 02:45:51,160
one half opposite means I changed the sign. If the first slope turned out to be say negative one

1479
02:45:51,160 --> 02:45:58,360
third, the reciprocal of one third is three over one or just three. And the opposite means I change

1480
02:45:58,360 --> 02:46:06,520
it from a negative to a positive. So my perpendicular slope would be would be three. One more example,

1481
02:46:06,520 --> 02:46:13,080
if I started off with the slope of say seven halves, then the reciprocal of that would be

1482
02:46:13,080 --> 02:46:19,560
two sevenths, and I change it to an opposite reciprocal by changing the positive to a negative.

1483
02:46:20,920 --> 02:46:23,800
Let's use these two principles in some examples.

1484
02:46:25,880 --> 02:46:30,840
In our first example, we need to find the equation of a line that's parallel to this one,

1485
02:46:30,840 --> 02:46:36,760
and goes through the point negative three two. Well, in order to get started, I need to figure

1486
02:46:36,760 --> 02:46:42,920
out the slope of this line. So let me put this line into a more standard form the the slope intercept

1487
02:46:42,920 --> 02:46:50,200
form. So I'll start with three y minus four x plus six equals zero, I'm going to solve for y to put

1488
02:46:50,200 --> 02:46:57,400
it in this this more standard form. So I'll say three y equals four x minus six, and then divide

1489
02:46:57,400 --> 02:47:04,920
by three to get y equals four thirds x minus six thirds is divided all my terms by three, I can

1490
02:47:05,480 --> 02:47:12,600
simplify that a little bit y equals four thirds x minus two. Now I can read off the slope of my

1491
02:47:12,600 --> 02:47:20,440
original line. And one is four thirds. That means my slope of my new line, my parallel line will

1492
02:47:20,440 --> 02:47:29,960
also be four thirds. So my new line will have the equation y equals four thirds x plus b for some b,

1493
02:47:29,960 --> 02:47:34,760
of course, b will probably not be negative two, like it was for the first line, it'll be something

1494
02:47:34,760 --> 02:47:40,040
else determined by the fact that it goes through this point negative three two. To figure out what

1495
02:47:40,040 --> 02:47:46,920
b is, I'll plug in the point negative three two for negative three for x, and two for y. So that

1496
02:47:46,920 --> 02:47:55,400
gives me two equals four thirds times negative three plus b, and I'll solve for b. So let's see.

1497
02:47:55,400 --> 02:48:03,400
First, let me just simplify. So two equals, this is negative 12 thirds plus b, or in other words,

1498
02:48:03,400 --> 02:48:10,680
two is negative four plus b. So that means that b is going to be six. And my my parallel line will

1499
02:48:10,680 --> 02:48:19,560
have the equation y equals four thirds x plus six. Next, let's find the equation of a line

1500
02:48:19,560 --> 02:48:25,960
that's perpendicular to a given line through and go through a given point. Again, in order to get

1501
02:48:25,960 --> 02:48:31,240
started, I need to find what the slope of this given line is. So I'll rewrite it. Well, first

1502
02:48:31,240 --> 02:48:38,920
I'll just copy it over six x plus three y equals four. And then I can put it in the standard slope

1503
02:48:38,920 --> 02:48:45,960
intercept form by solving for y. So three y is negative six x plus four, divide everything by

1504
02:48:45,960 --> 02:48:55,320
three, I get y equals negative six thirds x plus four thirds. So y is negative two x plus four thirds.

1505
02:48:55,320 --> 02:49:01,560
So on my original slope of my original line is negative two, which means my perpendicular slope

1506
02:49:01,560 --> 02:49:06,840
is the opposite reciprocal. So I take the reciprocal of negative two, that's negative

1507
02:49:06,840 --> 02:49:12,600
one half and I change the sign. So that gives me one half as the slope of my perpendicular line.

1508
02:49:13,320 --> 02:49:22,360
Now my new line, I know it's going to be y equals one half x plus b for some b. And I can plug in

1509
02:49:22,360 --> 02:49:32,600
my point on my new line. So one for y and four for x and solve for b. So I get one equals two

1510
02:49:32,600 --> 02:49:39,880
plus b. So b is negative one. And so my new line has equation one half x minus one.

1511
02:49:42,600 --> 02:49:46,760
These next two examples are a little bit different, because now we're looking at

1512
02:49:46,760 --> 02:49:56,280
a line parallel to a completely horizontal line. Let me draw this line y equals three. So the y

1513
02:49:56,360 --> 02:50:02,920
coordinate is always three, which means that my line will be a horizontal line through that height

1514
02:50:02,920 --> 02:50:09,960
at height y equals three. If I want something parallel to this line, it will also be a horizontal

1515
02:50:09,960 --> 02:50:16,120
line. Since it goes through the point negative two one, let's see negative two one, it has to go

1516
02:50:16,120 --> 02:50:23,480
through that point there. It's going to have always have a y coordinate of one, the same as

1517
02:50:23,480 --> 02:50:28,600
the y coordinate of the point it goes through. So my answer will just be y equals one.

1518
02:50:30,600 --> 02:50:37,800
In the next example, we want a line that's perpendicular to the line y equals four, another

1519
02:50:39,080 --> 02:50:46,040
horizontal line y equals four. But perpendicular means I'm going to need a vertical line. So I need

1520
02:50:46,040 --> 02:50:56,440
a vertical line that goes through the point three, four. Okay. And so I'm going to draw a vertical

1521
02:50:56,440 --> 02:51:04,760
line there. Now vertical lines have the form x equals something for their equation. And to find

1522
02:51:04,760 --> 02:51:09,000
what x equals, I just need to look at the x coordinate of the point I'm going through,

1523
02:51:09,080 --> 02:51:16,280
this point three, four. So that x coordinate is three. And all the points on this, this perpendicular

1524
02:51:16,280 --> 02:51:21,160
and vertical line have x coordinate three. So my answer is x equals three.

1525
02:51:27,160 --> 02:51:32,040
In this video, we use the fact that parallel lines have the same slope. And perpendicular lines

1526
02:51:32,040 --> 02:51:37,320
have opposite reciprocal slopes to find the equations of parallel and perpendicular lines.

1527
02:51:39,000 --> 02:51:42,680
This video introduces functions and their domains and ranges.

1528
02:51:44,120 --> 02:51:50,120
A function is a correspondence between input numbers, usually the x values,

1529
02:51:50,120 --> 02:51:56,760
and output numbers, usually the y values, that sends each input number to exactly one output

1530
02:51:56,760 --> 02:52:04,600
number. Sometimes a function is thought of as a rule or machine in which you can feed in

1531
02:52:05,160 --> 02:52:13,560
x values as input and get out y values as output. So a non-mathematical example of a function might

1532
02:52:13,560 --> 02:52:21,320
be the biological mother function, which takes as input any person and gives as output their

1533
02:52:21,320 --> 02:52:29,400
biological mother. This function satisfies the condition that each input number object person

1534
02:52:29,400 --> 02:52:36,760
in this case gets sent to exactly one output person because if you take any person, they just

1535
02:52:36,760 --> 02:52:43,320
have one biological mother. So that rule does give you a function. But if I change things around

1536
02:52:43,960 --> 02:52:51,720
and just use the mother function, which sends to each person their mother, that's no longer going

1537
02:52:51,720 --> 02:52:55,960
to be a function because there are some people who have more than one mother, right? They could have

1538
02:52:55,960 --> 02:53:01,720
a biological mother and adopted mother or a mother and a stepmother or any number of situations.

1539
02:53:01,720 --> 02:53:07,080
So since there's at least some people who you would put it as input and then you'd

1540
02:53:07,080 --> 02:53:13,000
get like more than one possible output, that violates this rule of functions. It would not be

1541
02:53:13,000 --> 02:53:18,200
a function. Now most of the time we'll work with functions that are described with equations, not

1542
02:53:18,200 --> 02:53:23,480
in terms of mothers. So for example we could have the function y equals x squared plus one.

1543
02:53:23,640 --> 02:53:30,200
This can also be written as f of x equals x squared plus one. Here f of x is function notation

1544
02:53:30,200 --> 02:53:38,120
that stands for the output value of y. Notice that this notation is not representing multiplication.

1545
02:53:38,120 --> 02:53:44,920
We're not multiplying f by x. Instead, we're going to be putting in a value for x as input

1546
02:53:44,920 --> 02:53:52,120
and getting out a value of f of x or y. For example, if we want to evaluate f of two,

1547
02:53:52,600 --> 02:53:59,800
we're plugging in two as input for x either in this equation or in that equation. Since

1548
02:54:01,000 --> 02:54:10,520
f of two means two squared plus one, f of two is going to equal five. Similarly f of five means I

1549
02:54:10,520 --> 02:54:19,560
plug in five for x. So that's going to be five squared plus one or 26. Sometimes it's useful

1550
02:54:19,560 --> 02:54:24,680
to evaluate a function on a more complicated expression involving other variables. In this

1551
02:54:24,680 --> 02:54:30,200
case, remember the functions value on any expression is just what you get when you

1552
02:54:30,200 --> 02:54:39,480
plug in that whole expression for x. So f of a plus three is going to be the quantity a plus

1553
02:54:39,480 --> 02:54:49,080
three squared plus one. We could rewrite that as a squared plus six a plus nine plus one,

1554
02:54:49,080 --> 02:54:56,600
or a squared plus six a plus 10. When evaluating a function on a complex expression, it's important

1555
02:54:56,600 --> 02:55:03,480
to keep the parentheses when you plug in for x. That way, you evaluate the function on the whole

1556
02:55:03,480 --> 02:55:14,600
expression. For example, it would be wrong to write f of a plus three equals a plus three squared

1557
02:55:14,600 --> 02:55:19,800
plus one without the parentheses, because that would imply we were just squaring the three and

1558
02:55:19,800 --> 02:55:27,960
not the whole expression a plus three. Sometimes the function is described with a graph instead

1559
02:55:27,960 --> 02:55:37,080
of an equation. In this example, this graph is supposed to represent the function g of x. Not all

1560
02:55:37,080 --> 02:55:42,840
graphs actually represent functions. For example, the graph of a circle doesn't represent a function.

1561
02:55:43,640 --> 02:55:49,160
That's because the graph of a circle violates the vertical line test, you can draw a vertical line,

1562
02:55:49,160 --> 02:55:55,160
and I'll intersect the graph in more than one point. But our graph at left satisfies the vertical

1563
02:55:55,160 --> 02:56:00,680
line test. Any vertical line intersects the graph and at most one point. That means it's a function

1564
02:56:00,680 --> 02:56:07,800
because every x value will have at most one y value that corresponds to it. Let's evaluate

1565
02:56:07,800 --> 02:56:15,560
g of two. Note that two is an x value. And we'll use the graph to find the corresponding y value.

1566
02:56:16,520 --> 02:56:23,160
So I look for two on the x axis, and find the point on the graph that has that x value. That's

1567
02:56:23,160 --> 02:56:31,960
right here. Now I can look at the y value of that point looks like three, and therefore g of two is

1568
02:56:31,960 --> 02:56:39,400
equal to three. If I try to do the same thing to evaluate g of five, I run into trouble. Five is an

1569
02:56:39,400 --> 02:56:46,120
x value. I look for it on the x axis. But there's no point on the graph that has that x value.

1570
02:56:46,520 --> 02:56:54,120
Therefore, g of five is undefined, or we can say it does not exist. The question of what x values and

1571
02:56:54,120 --> 02:57:01,160
y values make sense for a function leads us to a discussion of domain and range. The domain of a

1572
02:57:01,160 --> 02:57:07,320
function is all possible x values that make sense for that function. The range is the y values that

1573
02:57:07,320 --> 02:57:13,560
make sense for the function. In this example, we saw that the x value of five didn't have a

1574
02:57:14,360 --> 02:57:20,760
corresponding y value for this function. So the x value of five is not in the domain of our function

1575
02:57:20,760 --> 02:57:27,880
g. To find the x values in the domain, we have to look at the x values that correspond to points on

1576
02:57:27,880 --> 02:57:35,880
the graph. When we do that is to take the shadow or projection of the graph onto the x axis, and see

1577
02:57:35,880 --> 02:57:45,080
what x values are hit. It looks like we're hitting all x values starting at negative eight and continuing

1578
02:57:45,080 --> 02:57:54,120
up to four. So our domain is the x's between negative eight and four, including those end points,

1579
02:57:54,120 --> 02:57:59,400
or we can write this in interval notation as negative eight comma four with square brackets.

1580
02:58:00,600 --> 02:58:05,640
To find the range of the function, we look for the y values corresponding to points on this graph.

1581
02:58:06,280 --> 02:58:13,080
We can do that by taking the shadow or projection of the graph onto the y axis.

1582
02:58:16,360 --> 02:58:23,160
We seem to be hitting all y values from negative five up through three.

1583
02:58:24,760 --> 02:58:34,040
So our range is wise between negative five and three or an interval notation negative five three

1584
02:58:34,040 --> 02:58:39,720
with square brackets. If we meet a function that's described as an equation instead of a graph,

1585
02:58:40,520 --> 02:58:46,280
one way to find the domain and range are to graph the function. But it's often possible to find the

1586
02:58:46,280 --> 02:58:52,280
domain at least more quickly by using algebraic considerations. We think about what x values

1587
02:58:52,280 --> 02:58:57,480
it makes sense to plug into this expression, and what x values need to be excluded because they

1588
02:58:57,480 --> 02:59:03,320
make the algebraic expression impossible to evaluate. Specifically, to find the domain of a function,

1589
02:59:04,280 --> 02:59:11,960
we need to exclude x values that make the denominator zero since we can't divide by zero.

1590
02:59:13,160 --> 02:59:20,760
We also need to exclude x values that make an expression inside a square root sign negative

1591
02:59:20,760 --> 02:59:25,800
since we can't take the square root of a negative number. In fact, we need to exclude values that

1592
02:59:25,800 --> 02:59:32,200
make expression inside any even root negative because we can't take an even root of a negative

1593
02:59:32,200 --> 02:59:37,480
number even though we can take an odd root like a cube root of a negative number. Later,

1594
02:59:37,480 --> 02:59:42,040
when we look at logarithmic functions, we'll have some additional exclusions that we have to make.

1595
02:59:42,040 --> 02:59:47,880
But for now, these two principles should handle all functions we'll see. So let's apply them to

1596
02:59:47,880 --> 02:59:54,760
a couple examples. For the function in part a, we don't have any square root signs, but we do have

1597
02:59:54,760 --> 03:00:01,000
a denominator. So we need to exclude x values that make the denominator zero. In other words,

1598
03:00:01,000 --> 03:00:10,760
we need x squared minus 4x plus three to not be equal to zero. If we solve x squared minus 4x plus

1599
03:00:10,760 --> 03:00:19,000
three equal to zero, we can do that by factoring. And that gives us x equals three or x equals one.

1600
03:00:19,000 --> 03:00:25,960
So we need to exclude these values. All other x values should be fine. So if I draw the number line,

1601
03:00:25,960 --> 03:00:33,480
I can put on one and three and just dig out a hole at both of those. And my domain includes

1602
03:00:33,480 --> 03:00:39,720
everything else on the number line. In interval notation, this means my domain is everything

1603
03:00:39,720 --> 03:00:45,960
from negative infinity to one together with everything from one to three together with

1604
03:00:45,960 --> 03:00:52,040
everything from three to infinity. In this second example, we don't have any

1605
03:00:52,040 --> 03:00:59,240
denominators to worry about, but we do have a square root sign. So we need to exclude any x values

1606
03:00:59,240 --> 03:01:07,320
that make three minus 2x less than zero. In other words, we can include all x values for which three

1607
03:01:07,320 --> 03:01:13,640
minus 2x is greater than or equal to zero. Solving that inequality gives us three is greater than

1608
03:01:13,640 --> 03:01:22,600
or equal to 2x. In other words, x is less than or equal to three halves. I can draw this on the

1609
03:01:22,600 --> 03:01:31,080
number line or write it in interval notation. Notice that three halves is included. And that's

1610
03:01:31,080 --> 03:01:37,400
because three minus 2x is allowed to be zero, I can take the square root of zero, it's just zero.

1611
03:01:37,400 --> 03:01:42,840
And that's not a problem. Finally, let's look at a more complicated function that involves

1612
03:01:42,840 --> 03:01:47,080
both a square root and a denominator. Now there are two things I need to worry about.

1613
03:01:48,440 --> 03:01:57,240
I need the denominator to not be equal to zero. And I need the stuff inside the square root sign

1614
03:01:57,240 --> 03:02:02,760
to be greater than or equal to zero. From our earlier work, we know that the first condition

1615
03:02:02,760 --> 03:02:09,160
means that x is not equal to three, and x is not equal to one. And the second condition

1616
03:02:09,160 --> 03:02:14,920
means that x is less than or equal to three halves. Let's draw both of those conditions

1617
03:02:14,920 --> 03:02:22,600
on the number line. x is not equal to three and x is not equal to one means we've got everything

1618
03:02:23,640 --> 03:02:29,880
except those two dug out points. And the other condition x is less than or equal to three halves

1619
03:02:29,880 --> 03:02:36,600
means we can have three halves and everything to the left of it. Now to be in our domain and to

1620
03:02:36,600 --> 03:02:41,080
be legit for our function, we need both of these conditions to be true. So I'm going to connect

1621
03:02:41,080 --> 03:02:46,200
these conditions with an and. And that means we're looking for numbers on the number line that are

1622
03:02:46,200 --> 03:02:53,240
colored both red and blue. So I'll draw that above in purple. So that's everything from three halves

1623
03:02:53,240 --> 03:02:58,520
to one. I have to dig out one because one was a problem for the denominator. And then I can

1624
03:02:58,520 --> 03:03:04,840
continue for all the things that are colored both both colors red and blue. So my final domain

1625
03:03:04,840 --> 03:03:11,560
is going to be let's see negative infinity up to but not including one together with

1626
03:03:12,440 --> 03:03:18,040
one but not including it to three halves and I include three halves since that was colored

1627
03:03:18,040 --> 03:03:24,040
both red and blue also. In this video, we talked about functions, how to evaluate them, and how

1628
03:03:24,040 --> 03:03:30,520
to find domains and ranges. This video gives the graphs of some commonly used functions that I call

1629
03:03:30,520 --> 03:03:37,400
the toolkit functions. The first function is the function y equals x. Let's plot a few points on

1630
03:03:37,400 --> 03:03:47,480
the graph of this function. If x is zero, y is zero. If x is one, y is one. And so on y is always

1631
03:03:47,480 --> 03:03:53,400
equal to x doesn't have to just be an integer, it can be any real number. And while connecting the

1632
03:03:53,400 --> 03:04:00,040
dots, we get a straight line through the origin. Let's look at the graph of y equals x squared.

1633
03:04:00,680 --> 03:04:07,400
If x is zero, y is zero. So we go through the origin again. If x is one, y is one.

1634
03:04:08,520 --> 03:04:17,080
And if x is negative one, y is also one. The x value of two gives a y value of four and the x

1635
03:04:17,080 --> 03:04:23,720
value of negative two gives a y value of four also. Connecting the dots, we get a parabola.

1636
03:04:24,520 --> 03:04:34,120
Notice that this function is an even function. That means it has mirror symmetry across the y

1637
03:04:34,120 --> 03:04:40,360
axis, the left side looks like exactly like the mirror image of the right side. That happens because

1638
03:04:40,360 --> 03:04:45,880
when you square a positive number like two, you get the exact same y value as when you

1639
03:04:46,600 --> 03:04:54,760
square its mirror image x value of negative two. The next function y equals x cubed. I'll call that

1640
03:04:54,760 --> 03:05:02,760
a cubic. Let's plot a few points when x is zero, y is zero. When x is one, y is one. When x is

1641
03:05:02,760 --> 03:05:10,360
negative one, y is negative one. Two goes with the point eight way up here and an x value of negative

1642
03:05:10,360 --> 03:05:16,440
two is going to give us negative eight. If I connect the dots, I get something that looks kind of like

1643
03:05:16,440 --> 03:05:26,360
this. This function is what's called an odd function, because it has 180 degree rotational

1644
03:05:26,360 --> 03:05:31,960
symmetry around the origin. If I rotate this whole graph by 180 degrees, or in other words,

1645
03:05:31,960 --> 03:05:38,840
turn the paper upside down, I'll get exactly the same shape. The reason this function has this odd

1646
03:05:38,840 --> 03:05:46,840
symmetry is because when I cube a positive number and get its y value, I get and cube the

1647
03:05:46,840 --> 03:05:52,520
corresponding negative number to get its y value, the negative number cubed gives us exactly the

1648
03:05:52,520 --> 03:06:00,200
negative of the y value we get with cubing the positive number. Let's look at the next example,

1649
03:06:00,200 --> 03:06:09,480
y equals a square root of x. Notice that the domain of this function is just x values bigger

1650
03:06:09,480 --> 03:06:14,280
than or equal to zero because we can't take the square root of a negative number. Let's plug in

1651
03:06:14,280 --> 03:06:21,960
a few x values, x is zero gives y is zero, x is one, square root of one is one, square root of four is

1652
03:06:21,960 --> 03:06:26,280
two. And connecting the dots, I get a function that looks like this.

1653
03:06:28,760 --> 03:06:33,240
The absolute value function is next. Again, if we plug in a few points,

1654
03:06:34,440 --> 03:06:41,960
x is zero goes with y equals zero, x is one gives us one, the absolute value of negative one is one.

1655
03:06:43,640 --> 03:06:49,800
Two two is on the graph and the absolute value of negative two is two. I'm ending up getting

1656
03:06:50,520 --> 03:06:55,880
a v shaped graph. It also has even or mirror symmetry.

1657
03:06:57,800 --> 03:07:04,280
Y equals two to the x is what's known as an exponential function. That's because the variable x

1658
03:07:04,280 --> 03:07:17,240
is in the exponent. If I plot a few points, two to the zero is one, two to the one is two,

1659
03:07:17,240 --> 03:07:23,960
two squared is four, two to the minus one is one half. I'll plot these on my graph.

1660
03:07:24,760 --> 03:07:31,240
Let me fill in a few more points. So let's see, two cubed is eight, that's way up here.

1661
03:07:31,880 --> 03:07:38,200
And negative two gives me one fourth, one eighth. Connecting the dots, I get something that's shaped

1662
03:07:38,200 --> 03:07:44,760
like this. You might have heard the expression exponential growth when talking about, for example,

1663
03:07:44,760 --> 03:07:52,360
population growth. This is function is represents exponential growth. It grows very, very steeply.

1664
03:07:52,360 --> 03:07:57,640
Every time we increase the x coordinate by one, we double the y coordinate.

1665
03:08:00,040 --> 03:08:06,600
We could also look at a function like y equals three to the x or sometimes y equals e to the x,

1666
03:08:06,600 --> 03:08:13,560
where e is just a number about 2.7. These functions look very similar. It's just the

1667
03:08:13,560 --> 03:08:21,800
bigger base makes us rise a little more steeply. Now let's look at the function y equals one over x.

1668
03:08:22,760 --> 03:08:29,640
It's not defined when x is zero. But I can plug in x equals one half, one over one half is two.

1669
03:08:31,480 --> 03:08:39,400
One over one is one. And one over two is one half. If I connect the dots, I get this shape

1670
03:08:39,960 --> 03:08:45,240
in the first quadrant, but I haven't looked at negative values of x. When x is negative, one over

1671
03:08:45,240 --> 03:08:52,680
negative one is negative one. One over negative a half is negative two. And I get a similar looking

1672
03:08:52,680 --> 03:09:03,640
piece in the third quadrant. This is an example of a hyperbola. And it's also an odd function,

1673
03:09:03,640 --> 03:09:09,560
because it has that 180 degree rotational symmetry. If I turn the page upside down,

1674
03:09:09,560 --> 03:09:15,000
it'll look exactly the same. Finally, let's look at y equals one over x squared.

1675
03:09:16,200 --> 03:09:19,960
Again, it's not defined when x is zero, but I can plug in points like

1676
03:09:20,840 --> 03:09:27,880
one half for x. Let's see one over one half squared is one over one fourth, which is four.

1677
03:09:28,520 --> 03:09:36,120
And one over one squared, one over two squared is a fourth. It looks pretty much like the previous

1678
03:09:36,120 --> 03:09:41,080
function. It's just a little bit more extreme rises a little more steeply, falls a little more

1679
03:09:41,080 --> 03:09:46,120
dramatically. But for negative values of x, something a little bit different goes on. For

1680
03:09:46,120 --> 03:09:53,400
example, one over negative two squared is just one over four, which is a fourth. So I can plot

1681
03:09:53,400 --> 03:10:01,720
so I can plot that point there. And one over negative one squared, that's just one. So my

1682
03:10:01,720 --> 03:10:06,680
curve for negative values of x is going to lie in the second quadrant, not the third quadrant.

1683
03:10:07,400 --> 03:10:15,560
This is an example of an even function, because it has perfect mirror symmetry across the y axis.

1684
03:10:16,920 --> 03:10:21,800
These are the toolkit functions. And I recommend you memorize the shape of each of them.

1685
03:10:22,520 --> 03:10:28,280
That way you can draw at least a rough sketch very quickly without having to plug in points.

1686
03:10:29,400 --> 03:10:31,960
That's all for the graphs of the toolkit functions.

1687
03:10:34,200 --> 03:10:40,440
If we change the equation of a function, then the graph of the function changes or transforms

1688
03:10:40,440 --> 03:10:46,520
in predictable ways. This video gives some rules and examples for transformations of functions.

1689
03:10:47,160 --> 03:10:51,400
To get the most out of this video, it's helpful if you're already familiar with the graph of

1690
03:10:51,400 --> 03:10:57,000
some typical functions, I call them toolkit functions, like y equals square root of x,

1691
03:10:57,000 --> 03:11:03,000
y equals x squared, y equals the absolute value of x, and so on. If you're not familiar with those

1692
03:11:03,000 --> 03:11:08,840
graphs, I encourage you to watch my video called toolkit functions first before watching this one.

1693
03:11:10,200 --> 03:11:16,440
I want to start by reviewing function notation. If g of x represents the function the square root of

1694
03:11:16,440 --> 03:11:24,360
x, then we can rewrite these expressions in terms of square roots. For example, g of x minus two

1695
03:11:24,920 --> 03:11:28,040
is the same thing as the square root of x minus two.

1696
03:11:30,280 --> 03:11:38,120
g of quantity x minus two means we plug in x minus two everywhere we see an x.

1697
03:11:38,840 --> 03:11:44,120
So that would be the same thing as the square root of quantity x minus two.

1698
03:11:44,120 --> 03:11:50,280
In this second example, I say that we're subtracting two on the inside of the function,

1699
03:11:50,280 --> 03:11:55,320
because we're subtracting two before we apply the square root function. Whereas on the first

1700
03:11:55,320 --> 03:12:00,520
example, I say that the minus two is on the outside of the function. We're doing the square root

1701
03:12:00,520 --> 03:12:06,760
function first and then subtracting two. In this third example, g of three x, we're multiplying

1702
03:12:06,760 --> 03:12:12,840
by three on the inside of the function. To evaluate this in terms of square root, we plug in the entire

1703
03:12:12,840 --> 03:12:18,760
three x for x and the square root function. That gives us the square root of three x.

1704
03:12:20,120 --> 03:12:23,720
In the next example, we're multiplying by three on the outside of the function.

1705
03:12:24,760 --> 03:12:32,280
This is just three times the square root of x. Finally, g of minus x means the square root of

1706
03:12:32,280 --> 03:12:37,320
minus x. This might look a little odd because we're not used to taking the square root of a

1707
03:12:37,320 --> 03:12:43,320
negative number. But remember that if x itself is negative, like negative two, then negative x will

1708
03:12:43,320 --> 03:12:47,960
be negative negative two or positive two. So we'll really be taking the square root of a positive

1709
03:12:47,960 --> 03:12:53,480
number in that case. Let me record which of these are inside and which of these are outside of my

1710
03:12:53,480 --> 03:12:59,640
function. In this next set of examples, we're using the same function g of x is square root of x.

1711
03:12:59,640 --> 03:13:03,800
But this time we're starting with an expression with square roots in it and trying to write it

1712
03:13:03,800 --> 03:13:11,000
in terms of g of x. So the first example, the plus 17 is on the outside of my function,

1713
03:13:11,000 --> 03:13:18,120
because I'm taking the square root of x first and then adding 17. So I can write this as g of x

1714
03:13:18,120 --> 03:13:26,920
plus 17. In the second example, I'm taking x and adding 12 first, then I take the square root of the

1715
03:13:26,920 --> 03:13:32,280
whole thing. Since I'm adding the 12 to x first, that's on the inside of my function. So I write

1716
03:13:32,280 --> 03:13:40,840
that as g of the quantity x plus 12. Remember that this notation means I plug in the entire x plus

1717
03:13:40,840 --> 03:13:47,000
12 into the square root sign, which gives me exactly square root of x plus 12. In this next

1718
03:13:47,000 --> 03:13:52,920
example, I'm doing the square root first and then multiplying by negative 36. So my minus 36

1719
03:13:52,920 --> 03:14:00,600
multiplication is outside my function. I can rewrite this as minus 36 times g of x. Finally,

1720
03:14:00,600 --> 03:14:06,120
in this last example, I take x multiply by a fourth and then apply the square root of x.

1721
03:14:06,120 --> 03:14:13,000
So that's the same thing as g of one fourth x, my one fourth x is on the inside of my function.

1722
03:14:13,560 --> 03:14:17,320
In other words, it's inside the parentheses when I use function notation.

1723
03:14:19,160 --> 03:14:22,920
Let's graph the square root of x and two transformations of this function.

1724
03:14:22,920 --> 03:14:29,160
y equals the square root of x goes through the points zero zero one one and four two,

1725
03:14:29,160 --> 03:14:32,600
since the square root of four is two, and looks something like this.

1726
03:14:34,520 --> 03:14:40,120
In order to graph y equals the square root of x minus two, notice that the minus two is on the

1727
03:14:40,120 --> 03:14:44,920
outside of the function. That means we're going to take the square root of x first and then subtract

1728
03:14:44,920 --> 03:14:51,400
two. So for example, if we start with the x value of zero and compute the square root of zero, that's

1729
03:14:52,200 --> 03:14:55,720
then we subtract two to give us a y value of negative two.

1730
03:14:56,920 --> 03:15:03,560
An x value of one, which under the square root function had a y value of one, now has a y value

1731
03:15:03,560 --> 03:15:11,640
that's decreased by two, one minus two is negative one. And finally, an x value of four, which under

1732
03:15:11,640 --> 03:15:18,040
the square root function had a y value of two, now has a y value of two minus two or zero. Its y

1733
03:15:18,040 --> 03:15:25,960
value was also decreased by two. If I plot these new points, zero goes with negative two, one goes

1734
03:15:25,960 --> 03:15:34,600
with negative one, and four goes with zero, I have my transformed graph. Because I subtracted two on

1735
03:15:34,600 --> 03:15:41,720
the outside of my function, my y values were decreased by two, which brought my graph down by two units.

1736
03:15:42,680 --> 03:15:49,080
Next, let's look at y equals the square root of quantity x minus two. Now we're subtracting two on

1737
03:15:49,080 --> 03:15:53,320
the inside of our function, which means we subtract two from x first and then take the square root.

1738
03:15:53,960 --> 03:16:00,840
In order to get the same y value of zero as we had in our blue graph, we need our x minus two to be

1739
03:16:00,840 --> 03:16:07,800
zero. So we need our original x to be two. In order to get the y value of one that we had in our blue

1740
03:16:08,040 --> 03:16:14,520
graph, we need to be taking the square root of one. So we need x minus two to be one, which means

1741
03:16:14,520 --> 03:16:21,240
that we need to start with an x value of three. And in order to reproduce our y value of two from

1742
03:16:21,240 --> 03:16:27,800
our original graph, we need the square root of x minus two to be two, which means we need to start

1743
03:16:27,800 --> 03:16:35,000
out by taking the square root of four, which means our x minus two is four. So our x should be up

1744
03:16:35,000 --> 03:16:43,080
there at six. If I plot my x values with my corresponding y values of square root of x minus

1745
03:16:43,080 --> 03:16:50,360
two, I get the following graph. Notice that the graph has moved horizontally to the right by two

1746
03:16:50,360 --> 03:16:58,360
units. To me, moving down by two units makes sense because we're subtracting two. So we're

1747
03:16:58,360 --> 03:17:03,960
decreasing y's by two units. But the minus two on the inside, that kind of does the opposite of what

1748
03:17:03,960 --> 03:17:09,640
I expect. I might expect it to move the graph left. I might expect the x values to be going

1749
03:17:09,640 --> 03:17:16,680
down by two units. But instead, it moves the graph to the right. Because the x units have to go up by

1750
03:17:16,680 --> 03:17:21,880
two units in order to get the right square root when I then subtract two units again.

1751
03:17:22,680 --> 03:17:25,640
The observations we made for these transformations of functions

1752
03:17:26,360 --> 03:17:33,080
hold in general, according to the following rules. First of all, numbers on the outside of the function,

1753
03:17:33,080 --> 03:17:39,560
like in our example, y equals the square root of x minus two. Those numbers affect the y values

1754
03:17:39,560 --> 03:17:45,560
and result in vertical motions, like we saw. These motions are in the direction you expect. So

1755
03:17:45,560 --> 03:17:51,720
subtracting two moves just down by two. If we were adding two instead, that would move us up by two.

1756
03:17:53,000 --> 03:17:58,440
Numbers on the inside of the function, that's like our example, y equals the square root of

1757
03:17:58,440 --> 03:18:04,040
quantity x minus two, those affect the x values and results in a horizontal motion.

1758
03:18:04,600 --> 03:18:09,720
These motions go in the opposite direction from what you expect. Remember, the minus two on the

1759
03:18:09,720 --> 03:18:15,640
inside actually shifted our graph to the right. If it had had a plus two on the inside, that would

1760
03:18:15,640 --> 03:18:23,080
actually shift our graph to the left. Adding results in a shift, those are called translations,

1761
03:18:23,080 --> 03:18:29,880
but multiplying, like something like y equals three times the square root of x, that would result

1762
03:18:29,880 --> 03:18:35,560
in a stretch or shrink. In other words, if I start with the square root of x,

1763
03:18:37,000 --> 03:18:42,040
and then want to graph y equals three times the square root of x, that stretches my graph

1764
03:18:42,040 --> 03:18:50,680
vertically by a factor of three, like this. If I want to graph y equals one third times the

1765
03:18:50,680 --> 03:18:58,600
square root of x, that shrinks my graph vertically by a factor of one third. Finally, a negative sign

1766
03:18:58,600 --> 03:19:04,120
results in reflection. For example, if I start with a graph of y equals a square root of x,

1767
03:19:05,240 --> 03:19:11,240
and then want to graph y equals the square root of negative x, that's going to do a reflection

1768
03:19:11,240 --> 03:19:15,080
in the horizontal direction because the negative is on the inside of the square root sign.

1769
03:19:15,080 --> 03:19:20,760
A reflection in the horizontal direction means a reflection across the y axis.

1770
03:19:22,520 --> 03:19:27,960
If instead I want to graph y equals negative the square root of x, that negative sign on the outside

1771
03:19:27,960 --> 03:19:36,680
means a vertical reflection, a reflection across the x axis. Pause the video for a moment and see

1772
03:19:36,680 --> 03:19:42,520
if you can describe what happens in these four transformations. In the first example, we're

1773
03:19:42,520 --> 03:19:48,200
subtracting four on the outside of the function. Adding and subtracting means a translation or

1774
03:19:48,200 --> 03:19:53,480
shift, and since we're on the outside of the function, it affects the y values, that's moving

1775
03:19:53,480 --> 03:20:00,840
us vertically. So this transformation should take the square root of graph and move it down

1776
03:20:00,840 --> 03:20:09,240
by four units. That would look something like this. In the next example, we're adding 12 on the

1777
03:20:09,240 --> 03:20:15,560
inside. That's still a translation, but now we're moving horizontally. And so since we go

1778
03:20:15,560 --> 03:20:21,640
the opposite direction we expect, we are going to go to the left by 12 units. That's going to look

1779
03:20:21,640 --> 03:20:27,880
something like this. In the next example, we're multiplying by three and introducing a negative

1780
03:20:27,880 --> 03:20:33,960
sign, both on the outside of our function. Outside our function means we're affecting the y values.

1781
03:20:33,960 --> 03:20:40,920
So and multiplication means we're stretching by a factor of three. The negative sign means we reflect

1782
03:20:40,920 --> 03:20:47,080
in the vertical direction. Here's stretching by a factor of three vertically before I apply the

1783
03:20:47,080 --> 03:20:54,760
minus sign. And now the minus sign reflects in the vertical direction. Finally, in this last

1784
03:20:54,760 --> 03:21:00,600
example, we're multiplying by one quarter on the inside of our function. We know that multiplication

1785
03:21:00,600 --> 03:21:07,160
means stretch or shrink. And since we're on the inside, it's a horizontal motion. And it does the

1786
03:21:07,160 --> 03:21:12,680
opposite of what we expect. So instead of shrinking by a factor of one fourth horizontally, it's

1787
03:21:12,680 --> 03:21:19,240
actually going to stretch by the reciprocal, a factor of four horizontally. That'll look something

1788
03:21:19,240 --> 03:21:25,800
like this. Notice that stretching horizontally by a factor of four looks kind of like shrinking

1789
03:21:25,800 --> 03:21:31,960
vertically by a factor of one half. And that's actually borne out by the algebra, because the

1790
03:21:31,960 --> 03:21:36,840
square root of one fourth x is the same thing as the square root of one fourth times the square root

1791
03:21:36,840 --> 03:21:44,280
of x, which is the same thing as one half times the square root of x. And so now we can see algebraically

1792
03:21:44,280 --> 03:21:50,920
that a vertical shrink by a factor of one half is the same as a horizontal stretch by a factor of

1793
03:21:50,920 --> 03:21:57,080
four, at least for this function, the square root function. This video gave some rules for

1794
03:21:57,080 --> 03:22:05,080
transformations of functions, which I'll repeat below. Numbers on the outside correspond to changes

1795
03:22:05,080 --> 03:22:13,720
in the y values, or vertical motions. Numbers on the inside of the function affect the x values

1796
03:22:14,280 --> 03:22:23,160
and result in horizontal motions. Adding and subtracting corresponds to translations or shifts.

1797
03:22:24,840 --> 03:22:32,440
Multiplying and dividing by numbers corresponds to stretches and shrinks. And putting in a negative

1798
03:22:32,440 --> 03:22:41,880
sign corresponds to a reflection. A horizontal reflection, if the negative sign is on the inside

1799
03:22:41,880 --> 03:22:47,720
and a vertical reflection, if the negative sign is on the outside. Knowing these basic rules about

1800
03:22:47,720 --> 03:22:52,840
transformations empowers you to be able to sketch graphs of much more complicated functions,

1801
03:22:53,880 --> 03:22:59,320
like y equals three times the square root of x plus two, by simply considering the transformations

1802
03:23:00,440 --> 03:23:07,720
one at a time. A quadratic function is a function that can be written in the form f of x equals

1803
03:23:07,800 --> 03:23:18,920
ax squared plus bx plus c, where a, b, and c are real numbers. And a is not equal to zero.

1804
03:23:19,640 --> 03:23:26,200
The reason we require that a is not equal to zero is because if a were equal to zero,

1805
03:23:26,200 --> 03:23:32,520
we'd have f of x is equal to bx plus c, which is called a linear function.

1806
03:23:33,480 --> 03:23:38,600
So by making sure that a is not zero, we make sure there's really an x squared term,

1807
03:23:38,600 --> 03:23:44,440
which is the hallmark of a quadratic function. Please pause the video for a moment and decide

1808
03:23:44,440 --> 03:23:51,000
which of these equations represent quadratic functions. The first function can definitely

1809
03:23:51,000 --> 03:23:59,320
be written in the form g of x equals ax squared plus bx plus c, in fact it's already written in

1810
03:23:59,320 --> 03:24:08,360
that form, where a is negative five, b is 10, and c is three. The second equation is also a

1811
03:24:08,360 --> 03:24:16,760
quadratic function, because we can think of it as f of x equals one times x squared plus zero times

1812
03:24:16,760 --> 03:24:27,240
x plus zero. So it is in the right form, where a is one, b is zero, and c is zero. It's perfectly

1813
03:24:27,240 --> 03:24:33,400
fine for the coefficient of x and the constant term to be zero for a quadratic function. We

1814
03:24:33,400 --> 03:24:37,880
just need the coefficient of x squared to be nonzero, so the x squared term is preserved.

1815
03:24:39,480 --> 03:24:46,680
The third equation is not a quadratic function. It's a linear function, because there's no x

1816
03:24:46,680 --> 03:24:55,240
squared term. The fourth function might not look like a quadratic function, but if we rewrite it

1817
03:24:55,240 --> 03:25:02,280
by expanding out the x minus three squared, let's see what happens. We get y equals two times x

1818
03:25:02,280 --> 03:25:10,840
minus three times x minus three plus four. So that's two times x squared minus three x minus three x

1819
03:25:10,840 --> 03:25:23,160
plus nine plus four. Continuing, I get two x squared minus 12 x's plus 18 plus four. In other

1820
03:25:23,160 --> 03:25:31,000
words, y equals two x squared minus 12 x plus 22. So in fact, our function can be written in the right

1821
03:25:31,000 --> 03:25:39,240
form, and it is a quadratic function. A function that is already written in the form y equals a x

1822
03:25:39,240 --> 03:25:49,080
squared plus b x plus c is said to be in standard form. So our first example g of x is in standard

1823
03:25:49,080 --> 03:25:57,240
form. A function that's written in the format of the last function, that is, in the form of y equals

1824
03:25:57,240 --> 03:26:07,880
a times x minus h squared plus k for some numbers a, h, and k, that's said to be in vertex form.

1825
03:26:09,000 --> 03:26:13,080
I'll talk more about standard form and vertex form in another video.

1826
03:26:13,640 --> 03:26:18,920
In this video, we identified some quadratic functions and talked about the difference between

1827
03:26:18,920 --> 03:26:31,080
standard form and vertex form. This video is about graphing quadratic functions. A quadratic function,

1828
03:26:31,080 --> 03:26:40,120
which is typically written in standard form, like this, or sometimes in vertex form, like this, always

1829
03:26:40,680 --> 03:26:47,320
has the graph that looks like a parabola. This video will show how to tell whether the parabola is

1830
03:26:47,320 --> 03:26:58,280
pointing up or down, how to find its x-intercepts, and how to find its vertex. The bare bones basic

1831
03:26:58,280 --> 03:27:06,600
quadratic function is f of x equals x squared. It goes to the origin since f of zero is zero

1832
03:27:06,600 --> 03:27:15,960
squared, which is zero, and it is a parabola pointing upwards like this. The vertex of a parabola

1833
03:27:15,960 --> 03:27:21,480
is its lowest point if it's pointing upwards, and its highest point if it's pointing downwards.

1834
03:27:22,520 --> 03:27:29,800
So in this case, the vertex is at zero zero. The x-intercepts are where the graph crosses the

1835
03:27:29,880 --> 03:27:37,000
x-axis, in other words, where y is zero. And in this function, y equals zero means that x squared is

1836
03:27:37,000 --> 03:27:43,800
zero, which happens only when x is zero. So the x-intercept, there's only one of them, is also zero.

1837
03:27:45,000 --> 03:27:50,200
This second function, y equals negative three x squared, also goes through the origin,

1838
03:27:50,840 --> 03:27:58,120
since the function's value when x is zero is y equals zero. But in this case, the parabola is

1839
03:27:58,120 --> 03:28:04,840
pointing downwards. That's because thinking about transformations of functions, a negative sign on

1840
03:28:04,840 --> 03:28:11,800
the outside reflects the function vertically over the x-axis, making the parabola instead of pointing

1841
03:28:11,800 --> 03:28:20,040
upwards, reflecting the point downwards. The number three on the outside stretches the graph

1842
03:28:20,040 --> 03:28:25,560
vertically by a factor of three, so it makes it kind of long and skinny, like this.

1843
03:28:28,520 --> 03:28:33,720
In general, a negative coefficient to the x squared term means the parabola will be pointing

1844
03:28:33,720 --> 03:28:39,080
down, whereas a positive coefficient, like here the coefficient's one, means the parabola's pointing

1845
03:28:39,080 --> 03:28:47,640
up. I'll write that rule over here. So if a is bigger than zero, the parabola opens up,

1846
03:28:49,160 --> 03:28:54,120
and if the value of the coefficient a is less than zero, then the parabola opens down.

1847
03:28:54,120 --> 03:29:01,320
In this second example, we can see again that the vertex is at zero zero, and the x intercept is x

1848
03:29:01,320 --> 03:29:09,480
equals zero. Let's look at this third example. If we multiplied our expression out, we'd see

1849
03:29:09,480 --> 03:29:15,320
that the coefficient of x squared would be two, a positive number. So that means our parabola is

1850
03:29:15,320 --> 03:29:22,360
going to be opening up. But the vertex of this parabola will no longer be at the origin. In fact,

1851
03:29:22,360 --> 03:29:26,920
we can find the parabola's vertex by thinking about transformations of functions.

1852
03:29:28,440 --> 03:29:36,600
Our function is related to the function y equals two x squared by moving it to the right by three

1853
03:29:36,600 --> 03:29:47,480
and up by four. Since y equals two x squared has a vertex at zero zero, if we move that whole

1854
03:29:47,480 --> 03:29:56,920
parabola, including the vertex right by three, and up by four, the vertex will end up at the point

1855
03:29:56,920 --> 03:30:07,080
three, four. So a parabola will look something like this. Notice how easy it was to just read

1856
03:30:07,080 --> 03:30:13,720
off the vertex when our quadratic function is written in this form. In fact, any parabola,

1857
03:30:13,720 --> 03:30:20,520
any quadratic function written in the form a times x minus h squared plus k has a vertex

1858
03:30:21,240 --> 03:30:28,520
at hk. By the same reasoning, we're moving the parabola with a vertex at the origin

1859
03:30:28,520 --> 03:30:36,440
to the right by h and up by k. That's why this form of a quadratic function is called the vertex

1860
03:30:36,440 --> 03:30:44,680
form. Notice that this parabola has no x intercepts because it does not cross the x axis.

1861
03:30:45,960 --> 03:30:50,840
For our final function, we have g of x equals five x squared plus 10x plus three.

1862
03:30:52,280 --> 03:30:56,920
We know the graph of this function will be a parabola pointing upwards because the coefficient

1863
03:30:56,920 --> 03:31:05,480
of x squared is positive. To find the x intercepts, we can set y equals zero. Since the x intercepts

1864
03:31:05,480 --> 03:31:13,400
is where our graph crosses the x axis, and that's where the y value is zero. So zero equals five x

1865
03:31:13,400 --> 03:31:19,080
squared plus 10x plus three, I'm going to use the quadratic formula to solve that. So x is

1866
03:31:19,080 --> 03:31:26,840
negative 10 plus or minus the square root of 10 squared minus four times five times three,

1867
03:31:26,840 --> 03:31:33,880
all over two times five. That simplifies to x equals negative 10 plus or minus the square root

1868
03:31:33,880 --> 03:31:42,120
of 40 over 10, which simplifies further to x equals negative 10 over 10 plus or minus the

1869
03:31:42,120 --> 03:31:49,400
square root of 40 over 10, which is negative one plus or minus two square root of 10 over 10,

1870
03:31:49,400 --> 03:31:56,040
or negative one plus or minus square root of 10 over five. Since the square root of 10 is just a

1871
03:31:56,040 --> 03:32:03,800
little bit bigger than three, this works out to approximately about negative two-fifths and

1872
03:32:03,800 --> 03:32:10,120
negative eight-fifths. So somewhere around right here. So our parabola is going to look something

1873
03:32:10,120 --> 03:32:17,480
like this. Notice that it goes through, crosses the x axis at y equals three. That's because when

1874
03:32:17,480 --> 03:32:25,960
we plug in x equals zero into here, we get y equals three. So the y intercept is at three.

1875
03:32:26,760 --> 03:32:35,800
Finally, we can find the vertex. Since this function is written in standard form, the y equals

1876
03:32:35,800 --> 03:32:44,760
ax plus x squared plus bx plus c form, and not in vertex form, we can't just read off the vertex

1877
03:32:44,760 --> 03:32:50,200
like we could before. But there's a trick called the vertex formula, which says that whenever you

1878
03:32:50,200 --> 03:32:57,480
have a function in a quadratic function in standard form, the vertex has an x coordinate

1879
03:32:59,000 --> 03:33:08,440
of negative b over 2a. So in this case, that's an x coordinate of negative 10 over two times five

1880
03:33:08,440 --> 03:33:14,040
or negative one, which is kind of like where I put it on the graph. To find the y coordinate

1881
03:33:14,040 --> 03:33:23,800
of that vertex, I can just plug in negative one into my equation for x, which gives me y equals

1882
03:33:23,800 --> 03:33:31,320
five times negative one squared plus 10 times negative one plus three, which is negative two.

1883
03:33:32,600 --> 03:33:37,000
So I think I better redraw my graph a little bit to put that vertex down at

1884
03:33:37,000 --> 03:33:39,720
a y coordinate of negative two, where it's supposed to be.

1885
03:33:43,960 --> 03:33:48,920
Let's summarize the steps we use to graph these quadratic functions. First of all,

1886
03:33:48,920 --> 03:33:52,520
the graph of a quadratic function has the shape of a parabola.

1887
03:33:55,480 --> 03:34:01,480
The parabola opens up if the coefficient of x squared, which we call a is greater than zero,

1888
03:34:01,480 --> 03:34:09,000
and down if a is less than zero. To find the x intercepts, we set y equal to zero,

1889
03:34:09,000 --> 03:34:18,600
or in other words, f of x equal to zero, and solve for x. To find the vertex, we can either read it

1890
03:34:18,600 --> 03:34:29,560
off as hk if our function is in vertex form, or we can use the vertex formula

1891
03:34:31,480 --> 03:34:41,400
and get the x coordinate of the vertex to be negative b over two a, if our function is in

1892
03:34:41,400 --> 03:34:50,920
standard form. To find the y coordinate of the vertex in this case, we just plug in the x coordinate

1893
03:34:52,600 --> 03:34:59,560
and figure out what y is. Finally, we can always find additional points on the graph by plugging in

1894
03:35:00,200 --> 03:35:07,080
values of x. In this video, we learned some tricks for graphing quadratic functions.

1895
03:35:08,040 --> 03:35:15,960
In particular, we saw that the vertex can be read off as hk if our function is written

1896
03:35:15,960 --> 03:35:20,920
in vertex form, and the x coordinate of the vertex can be calculated

1897
03:35:23,480 --> 03:35:30,920
as negative b over two a if our function is in standard form. For an explanation of why this

1898
03:35:30,920 --> 03:35:38,840
vertex formula works, please see it in my other video. A quadratic in standard form looks like

1899
03:35:38,840 --> 03:35:46,280
y equals ax squared plus bx plus c, where a, b, and c are real numbers, and a is not zero.

1900
03:35:47,320 --> 03:35:54,840
A quadratic function in vertex form looks like y equals a times x minus h squared plus k,

1901
03:35:54,840 --> 03:36:01,000
where a, h, and k are real numbers, and a is not zero. When a function is in vertex form,

1902
03:36:01,000 --> 03:36:09,080
it's easy to read off the vertex. It's just the ordered pair hk. This video explains how to get

1903
03:36:09,080 --> 03:36:16,520
from vertex form to standard form and vice versa. Let's start by converting this quadratic function

1904
03:36:16,520 --> 03:36:22,680
from vertex form to standard form. That's pretty straightforward. We just have to distribute out.

1905
03:36:24,840 --> 03:36:29,480
So if I multiply out the x minus three squared,

1906
03:36:31,880 --> 03:36:41,000
I get minus four times x squared minus six x plus nine plus one, distributing the negative four,

1907
03:36:41,000 --> 03:36:50,360
I get negative four x squared plus 24x minus 36 plus one. So that works out to minus four x squared

1908
03:36:50,360 --> 03:36:58,280
plus 24x minus 35. And I have my quadratic function now in standard form.

1909
03:36:59,880 --> 03:37:05,240
Now let's go the other direction and convert a quadratic function that's already in standard form

1910
03:37:05,800 --> 03:37:16,040
into vertex form. That is, we want to put it in the form of g of x equals a times x minus h squared

1911
03:37:16,040 --> 03:37:25,400
plus k, where the vertex is at hk. To do this, it's handy to use the vertex formula.

1912
03:37:27,000 --> 03:37:34,680
The vertex formula says that the x coordinate of the vertex is given by negative b over two a,

1913
03:37:35,320 --> 03:37:43,160
where a is the coefficient of x squared, and b is the coefficient of x. So in this case,

1914
03:37:43,160 --> 03:37:48,840
we get an x coordinate of negative eight over two times two or negative two.

1915
03:37:49,800 --> 03:37:57,880
To find the y coordinate of the vertex, we just plug in the x coordinate into our formula for g

1916
03:37:57,880 --> 03:38:05,240
of x. So that's g of negative two, which is two times negative two squared plus eight times negative

1917
03:38:05,240 --> 03:38:13,560
two plus six. And that works out to be negative two by coincidence. So the vertex for our quadratic

1918
03:38:13,560 --> 03:38:19,960
function has coordinates negative two, negative two. And if I want to write g of x in vertex form,

1919
03:38:19,960 --> 03:38:28,440
it's going to be a times x minus negative two squared plus minus two. That's because

1920
03:38:29,240 --> 03:38:38,600
remember, we subtract h and we add k. So that simplifies to g of x equals a times x plus two

1921
03:38:38,600 --> 03:38:44,520
squared minus two. And finally, we just need to figure out what this leading coefficient a is.

1922
03:38:45,080 --> 03:38:52,840
But notice if we were to multiply distribute this out, then the coefficient of x squared would end

1923
03:38:52,920 --> 03:38:59,080
up being a. So therefore, the coefficient of x squared here, which is a has to be the same as

1924
03:38:59,080 --> 03:39:04,440
the coefficient of x squared here, which we conveniently also call a. In other words, our a down

1925
03:39:04,440 --> 03:39:11,560
here needs to be two. So I'm going to write that as g of x equals two times x plus two squared

1926
03:39:11,560 --> 03:39:18,920
minus two, lots of twos in this problem. And that's our quadratic function in vertex form.

1927
03:39:18,920 --> 03:39:22,840
If I want to check my answer, of course, I could just distribute out again, I'd get

1928
03:39:24,200 --> 03:39:34,200
two times x squared plus four x plus two minus two. In other words, two x squared plus eight x

1929
03:39:34,200 --> 03:39:40,360
plus six, which checks out to exactly what I started with. This video showed how to get from

1930
03:39:40,360 --> 03:39:46,920
vertex form to standard form by distributing out and how to get from standard form to vertex form

1931
03:39:47,000 --> 03:39:49,720
by finding the vertex using the vertex formula.

1932
03:39:51,880 --> 03:39:58,520
Suppose you have a quadratic function in the form y equals a x squared plus b x plus c,

1933
03:39:59,240 --> 03:40:02,600
and you want to find where the vertex is when you graph it.

1934
03:40:04,840 --> 03:40:14,600
The vertex formula says that the x coordinate of this vertex is at negative b over two a.

1935
03:40:14,920 --> 03:40:20,040
This video gives a justification for where that formula comes from.

1936
03:40:21,560 --> 03:40:27,240
Let's start with a specific example. Suppose I wanted to find the x intercepts and the vertex

1937
03:40:27,240 --> 03:40:34,520
for this quadratic function. To find the x intercepts, I would set y equal to zero and solve

1938
03:40:34,520 --> 03:40:41,160
for x. So that's zero equals three x squared plus seven x minus five. And to solve for x,

1939
03:40:41,160 --> 03:40:47,160
I use the quadratic formula. So x is going to be negative seven plus or minus the square root of

1940
03:40:47,160 --> 03:40:53,800
seven squared minus four times three times negative five all over two times three.

1941
03:40:55,400 --> 03:41:02,040
That simplifies to negative seven plus or minus the square root of 109 over six.

1942
03:41:02,040 --> 03:41:07,560
We could I could also write this as negative seven six plus the square root of 109 over six,

1943
03:41:08,200 --> 03:41:12,920
or x equals negative seven six minus the square root of 109 over six.

1944
03:41:13,560 --> 03:41:19,560
Since the square root of 109 is just a little bit bigger than 10, this can be approximated

1945
03:41:19,560 --> 03:41:26,440
by negative seven six plus 10 six and negative seven six minus 10 six.

1946
03:41:27,960 --> 03:41:34,040
So pretty close to I guess about what a half over here and pretty close to about negative

1947
03:41:34,040 --> 03:41:39,560
three over here. I'm just going to estimate so that I can draw a picture of the function.

1948
03:41:40,200 --> 03:41:45,160
Since the leading coefficient three is positive, I know my parabola is going to be opening up

1949
03:41:45,720 --> 03:41:53,960
and the intercepts are somewhere around here and here. So roughly speaking, it's going to look

1950
03:41:53,960 --> 03:42:03,400
something like this. Now the vertex is going to be somewhere in between the two x intercepts. In fact,

1951
03:42:03,400 --> 03:42:08,600
it's going to be by symmetry, it'll be exactly halfway in between the two x intercepts.

1952
03:42:09,160 --> 03:42:15,880
Since the x intercepts are negative seven six plus and minus 100 square root of 109 over six,

1953
03:42:15,880 --> 03:42:20,440
the number halfway in between those is going to be exactly negative seven six.

1954
03:42:21,800 --> 03:42:29,720
Right, because on the one hand, I have negative seven six plus something. And on the other hand,

1955
03:42:29,720 --> 03:42:36,200
I have negative seven six minus that same thing. So negative seven six will be exactly

1956
03:42:36,200 --> 03:42:44,200
in the middle. So my x coordinate of my vertex will be at negative seven six.

1957
03:42:45,160 --> 03:42:48,920
Notice that I got that number from the quadratic formula.

1958
03:42:52,040 --> 03:42:57,000
More generally, if I want to find the x intercepts for any quadratic function,

1959
03:42:57,000 --> 03:43:04,920
I set y equal to zero and solve for x using the quadratic formula negative b plus or minus

1960
03:43:04,920 --> 03:43:12,920
the square root of b squared minus four ac all over two a the x intercepts will be at these two

1961
03:43:12,920 --> 03:43:19,560
values. But the x coordinate of the vertex, which is exactly halfway in between the two x intercepts

1962
03:43:20,280 --> 03:43:25,640
will be at negative b over two a. That's where the vertex formula comes from.

1963
03:43:26,760 --> 03:43:31,800
And it turns out that this formula works even when there are no x intercepts, even when the

1964
03:43:31,800 --> 03:43:37,560
the quadratic formula gives us no solutions, the vertex still has the x coordinate negative b over

1965
03:43:37,560 --> 03:43:46,760
two a. And that's the justification of the vertex formula. This video is about polynomials

1966
03:43:46,760 --> 03:43:52,440
and their graphs. Recall that a polynomial is a function like this one, for example,

1967
03:43:54,200 --> 03:44:01,960
whose terms are numbers times powers of x. I'll start with some definitions. The degree of a

1968
03:44:01,960 --> 03:44:09,400
polynomial is the largest exponent. For example, for this polynomial, the degree is four.

1969
03:44:09,800 --> 03:44:16,680
The leading term is the term with the largest exponent. In the same example, the leading term

1970
03:44:16,680 --> 03:44:23,800
is five x to the fourth. It's conventional to write the polynomial in descending order of powers

1971
03:44:23,800 --> 03:44:29,400
of x, so the leading term is first. But the leading term doesn't have to be the first term. If I

1972
03:44:29,480 --> 03:44:38,520
wrote the same polynomial as y equals, say, two minus 17 x minus 21 x cubed plus five x fourth,

1973
03:44:38,520 --> 03:44:45,240
the leading term would still be the five x to the fourth, even though it was last. The leading

1974
03:44:45,240 --> 03:44:52,440
coefficient is the number in the leading term. In this example, the leading coefficient is five.

1975
03:44:52,840 --> 03:44:59,000
Finally, the constant term is the term with no x's in it. In our same example, the constant term

1976
03:44:59,000 --> 03:45:05,560
is two. Please pause the video for a moment and take a look at this next example of polynomial.

1977
03:45:06,120 --> 03:45:10,760
Figure out what's the degree, the leading term, the leading coefficient, and the constant term.

1978
03:45:11,960 --> 03:45:19,000
The degree is again four, since that's the highest power we have. And the leading term

1979
03:45:19,480 --> 03:45:26,280
is negative seven x to the fourth. The leading coefficient is negative seven, and the constant

1980
03:45:26,280 --> 03:45:35,480
term is 18. In the graph of the polynomial shown here, the three marked points are called turning

1981
03:45:35,480 --> 03:45:41,400
points, because the polynomial turns around and changes direction at those three points.

1982
03:45:41,880 --> 03:45:48,200
Those same points can also be called local extreme points, or they can be called local

1983
03:45:48,200 --> 03:45:55,160
maximum and minimum points. For this polynomial, the degree is four, and the number of turning

1984
03:45:55,160 --> 03:46:01,320
points is three. Let's compare the degree and the number of turning points for these next three

1985
03:46:01,320 --> 03:46:10,280
examples. For the first one, the degree is two, and there's one, two, three, four, five, six,

1986
03:46:10,520 --> 03:46:20,840
and there's one turning point. For the sixth example, the degree is three, and there's two

1987
03:46:20,840 --> 03:46:28,200
turning points. And for this last example, the degree is four, and there's one turning point.

1988
03:46:29,960 --> 03:46:35,400
For this first example, and the next two, the number of turning points is exactly one less than

1989
03:46:35,400 --> 03:46:42,120
the degree. So you might conjecture that this is always true. But in fact, this is not always true.

1990
03:46:43,000 --> 03:46:48,760
In this last example, the degree is four, but the number of turning points is one, not three.

1991
03:46:49,960 --> 03:46:54,280
In fact, it turns out that while the number of turning points is not always equal to the

1992
03:46:54,280 --> 03:47:01,240
degree minus one, it is always less than or equal to the degree minus one. That's a useful fact to

1993
03:47:01,240 --> 03:47:05,400
remember when you're sketching graphs or recognizing graphs of polynomials.

1994
03:47:06,760 --> 03:47:13,400
The end behavior of a function is how the ends of the function look as x gets bigger and bigger

1995
03:47:13,400 --> 03:47:19,080
heads towards infinity, or x gets goes through larger and larger negative numbers towards negative

1996
03:47:19,080 --> 03:47:27,560
infinity. In this first example, the graph of the function goes down as x gets towards infinity,

1997
03:47:27,560 --> 03:47:33,640
and as x goes towards negative infinity, I can draw this with two little arrows pointing down on

1998
03:47:33,640 --> 03:47:39,960
either side, or I can say in words that the function is falling as we had left and falling

1999
03:47:39,960 --> 03:47:47,640
also as we had right. In the second example, the graph rises to the left and rises to the right.

2000
03:47:48,760 --> 03:47:55,240
In the third example, the graph falls to the left, but rises to the right. And in the fourth

2001
03:47:55,240 --> 03:48:02,520
example, it rises to the left and falls to the right. If you study these examples and others,

2002
03:48:02,520 --> 03:48:09,400
you might notice there's a relationship between the degree of the polynomial, the leading coefficients

2003
03:48:09,400 --> 03:48:16,120
of the polynomials, and the end behavior. Specifically, these four types of end behavior

2004
03:48:16,120 --> 03:48:23,400
are determined by whether the degree is even or odd, and by whether the leading coefficient

2005
03:48:23,960 --> 03:48:31,880
is positive or negative. When the degree is even, and the leading coefficient is positive,

2006
03:48:32,520 --> 03:48:39,320
like in this example where the leading coefficient is one, we have this sorts of end behavior rising

2007
03:48:39,320 --> 03:48:45,720
on both sides. When the degree is even and the leading coefficient is negative, like in this

2008
03:48:45,720 --> 03:48:53,320
example, we have the end behavior that's falling on both sides. When the degree is odd, and the

2009
03:48:53,320 --> 03:48:58,520
leading coefficient is positive, that's like this example, with a degree three and a leading

2010
03:48:58,520 --> 03:49:06,440
coefficient three, then we have this sort of end behavior. And finally, when the degree is odd,

2011
03:49:06,440 --> 03:49:11,880
and the leading coefficient is negative, like in this example, we have this sort of end behavior.

2012
03:49:12,520 --> 03:49:19,560
I like to remember this chart just by thinking of the most simple examples, y equals x squared,

2013
03:49:19,560 --> 03:49:26,200
y equals negative x squared, y equals x cubed, and y equals negative x cubed, because I know by

2014
03:49:26,200 --> 03:49:35,080
heart what those four examples look like. Then I just have to remember that any polynomial with a

2015
03:49:35,080 --> 03:49:42,760
any polynomial with an even degree and positive leading coefficient has the same end behavior

2016
03:49:42,760 --> 03:49:50,600
as x squared. And similarly, any polynomial with even degree and negative leading coefficient

2017
03:49:50,600 --> 03:49:57,080
has the same end behavior as negative x squared, and similar statements for x cubed and negative x

2018
03:49:57,080 --> 03:50:03,960
cubed. We can use facts about turning points and end behavior to say something about the equation

2019
03:50:03,960 --> 03:50:11,240
of a polynomial just by looking at its graph. In this example, because of the end behavior,

2020
03:50:11,240 --> 03:50:17,800
we know that the degree is odd. We know that the leading coefficient

2021
03:50:19,720 --> 03:50:27,800
must be positive. And finally, since there are one, two, three, four turning points,

2022
03:50:27,800 --> 03:50:35,480
we know that the degree is greater than or equal to five. That's because the number of

2023
03:50:35,480 --> 03:50:41,960
turning points is less than or equal to the degree minus one. And in this case, the number of turning

2024
03:50:41,960 --> 03:50:49,640
points we said was four. And so solving that inequality, we get the degree is bigger than

2025
03:50:49,640 --> 03:50:56,440
or equal to five. Putting some of that information together, we see that the degree could be

2026
03:50:58,040 --> 03:51:04,680
five or seven or nine, or any odd number greater than or equal to five. But it couldn't be, for

2027
03:51:04,680 --> 03:51:13,080
example, three or six, because even numbers and and also numbers less than five are right out.

2028
03:51:13,080 --> 03:51:20,600
This video gave a lot of definitions, including the definition of degree, leading coefficients,

2029
03:51:22,200 --> 03:51:31,720
turning points, and end behavior. We saw that knowing the degree and the leading coefficient

2030
03:51:31,720 --> 03:51:35,720
can help you make predictions about the number of turning points and the end behavior,

2031
03:51:36,600 --> 03:51:42,440
as well as vice versa. This video is about exponential functions and their graphs.

2032
03:51:44,040 --> 03:51:50,760
An exponential function is a function that can be written in the form f of x equals a times b to

2033
03:51:50,760 --> 03:51:58,200
the x, where a and b are any real numbers, as long as a is not zero, and b is positive.

2034
03:51:59,480 --> 03:52:05,480
It's important to notice that for an exponential function, the variable x is in the exponent.

2035
03:52:06,120 --> 03:52:11,320
This is different from many other functions we've seen. For example, a quadratic function

2036
03:52:11,320 --> 03:52:17,560
like f of x equals three x squared has the variable in the base. So it's not an exponential function.

2037
03:52:19,480 --> 03:52:27,160
For exponential functions, f of x equals a times b to the x, we require that a is not equal to zero,

2038
03:52:27,160 --> 03:52:35,080
because otherwise, we would have f of x equals zero times b to the x, which just means that f of x

2039
03:52:35,080 --> 03:52:41,400
equals zero. And this is called a constant function, not an exponential function. Because f of x is

2040
03:52:41,400 --> 03:52:49,480
always equal to zero. In an exponential function, we require that b is bigger than zero, because

2041
03:52:49,480 --> 03:53:00,840
otherwise, for example, if b is equal to negative one, say, we'd have f of x equals a times negative

2042
03:53:00,840 --> 03:53:07,480
one to the x. Now, this would make sense for a lot of values of x. But if we tried to do something

2043
03:53:07,480 --> 03:53:15,880
like f of one half with our b's negative one, that would be the same thing as a times the square root

2044
03:53:15,880 --> 03:53:23,080
of negative one, which is not a real number. We'd get the same problem for other values of b, if the

2045
03:53:23,080 --> 03:53:31,080
values of b were negative. And if we tried b equals zero, we'd get a kind of ridiculous thing a times

2046
03:53:31,080 --> 03:53:37,000
zero to the x, which again is always zero. So that wouldn't count as an exponential either. So we can't

2047
03:53:37,000 --> 03:53:41,400
use any negative bases, and we can't use zero bases if we want an exponential function.

2048
03:53:42,760 --> 03:53:49,880
The number a in the expression f of x equals a times b to the x is called the initial value.

2049
03:53:50,280 --> 03:53:58,360
And the number b is called the base. The phrase initial value comes to the fact that if we plug in

2050
03:53:58,360 --> 03:54:05,560
x equals zero, we get a times b to the zero, well, anything to the zero is just one. So this is equal

2051
03:54:05,560 --> 03:54:15,880
to a. In other words, f of zero equals a. So if we think of starting out, when x equals zero, we get

2052
03:54:15,960 --> 03:54:22,360
we get the y value of a. That's why it's called the initial value.

2053
03:54:27,160 --> 03:54:32,680
Let's start out with this example, where y equals a times b to the x, an exponential function,

2054
03:54:32,680 --> 03:54:39,800
and we've set a equal to one and b equals the two. Notice that the y intercept, the value when x is

2055
03:54:39,800 --> 03:54:49,560
zero is going to be one. If I change my a value, my initial value, the y intercept changes.

2056
03:54:50,600 --> 03:54:59,720
The function is stretched out. If I make the value of a go to zero and then negative,

2057
03:55:01,080 --> 03:55:07,080
then my initial value becomes negative and my graph flips across the x-axis.

2058
03:55:08,040 --> 03:55:13,960
Let's go back to an a value of say one and see what happens when we change b.

2059
03:55:15,000 --> 03:55:25,000
Right now, the b value, the base is two. If I increase b, my y intercept sticks at one,

2060
03:55:25,000 --> 03:55:33,080
but my graph becomes steeper and steeper. If I put b back down close to one, my graph becomes

2061
03:55:33,800 --> 03:55:38,520
more flat. At exactly one, my graph is just a constant.

2062
03:55:40,520 --> 03:55:48,600
As b gets into fractional territory, 0.8, 0.7, 0.6, my graph starts to slope the other way.

2063
03:55:48,600 --> 03:55:54,280
It's decreasing now instead of increasing, but notice that the y intercept still hasn't changed.

2064
03:55:55,400 --> 03:56:00,920
I can get it more and more steep as my b gets farther and farther away from one. Of course,

2065
03:56:00,920 --> 03:56:04,040
when b goes to negative territory, my graph doesn't make any sense.

2066
03:56:07,800 --> 03:56:19,160
So a changes the y intercept and b changes the steepness of the graph, whether it's increasing

2067
03:56:19,160 --> 03:56:24,760
for b values bigger than one and decreasing for values of b less than one.

2068
03:56:25,720 --> 03:56:33,720
We'll summarize all these observations on the next slide. We've seen that for an exponential

2069
03:56:33,720 --> 03:56:41,560
function, y equals a times b to the x, the parameter or number a gives the y intercept.

2070
03:56:42,280 --> 03:56:47,880
The parameter b tells us how the graph is increasing or decreasing. Specifically,

2071
03:56:47,880 --> 03:56:56,440
if b is greater than one, the graph is increasing. And if b is less than one, the graph is decreasing.

2072
03:56:58,200 --> 03:57:01,880
The closer b is to the number one, the flatter the graph.

2073
03:57:03,240 --> 03:57:11,800
So for example, if I were to graph y equals 0.25 to the x, and y equals 0.4 to the x,

2074
03:57:12,760 --> 03:57:18,200
they would both be decreasing graphs, since the base for both of them is less than one.

2075
03:57:18,920 --> 03:57:27,720
But 0.25 is farther away from one, and 0.4 is closer to one. So 0.4 is going to be flatter,

2076
03:57:27,720 --> 03:57:35,880
and 0.25 is going to be more steep. So in this picture, this red graph would correspond to

2077
03:57:35,960 --> 03:57:41,240
0.25 to the x, and the blue graph would correspond to 0.4 to the x.

2078
03:57:43,240 --> 03:57:49,000
For all these exponential functions, whether the graphs are decreasing or increasing,

2079
03:57:49,000 --> 03:57:56,120
they all have a horizontal asymptote along the x axis, in other words, at the line y equals zero.

2080
03:57:57,080 --> 03:58:03,480
The domain is always from negative infinity to infinity. And the range is always

2081
03:58:03,880 --> 03:58:14,040
from zero to infinity, because the range is always positive y values. Actually, that's true

2082
03:58:14,600 --> 03:58:24,920
if a is greater than zero. If a is less than zero, then our graph flips over the x axis. Our domain

2083
03:58:24,920 --> 03:58:32,360
stays the same, but our range becomes negative infinity to zero. The most famous exponential

2084
03:58:32,360 --> 03:58:38,440
function is f of x equals e to the x. This function is also sometimes written as f of x equals x of

2085
03:58:38,440 --> 03:58:46,040
x. The number e is Euler's number, and it's approximately 2.7. This function has important

2086
03:58:46,040 --> 03:58:53,240
applications to calculus and to some compound interest problems. In this video, we looked at

2087
03:58:53,240 --> 03:59:00,200
exponential functions, functions of the form a times b to the x, where the variable is in the exponent.

2088
03:59:00,760 --> 03:59:11,560
We saw that they all have the same general shape, either increasing like this, or decreasing like this,

2089
03:59:12,520 --> 03:59:16,760
unless a is negative, in which case they flip over the x axis.

2090
03:59:18,600 --> 03:59:24,520
They all have a horizontal asymptote at y equals zero, the x axis.

2091
03:59:24,760 --> 03:59:31,720
In this video, we'll use exponential functions to model real world examples.

2092
03:59:32,760 --> 03:59:39,160
Let's suppose you're hired for a job. The starting salary is $40,000, with a guaranteed

2093
03:59:39,160 --> 03:59:47,480
annual raise of 3% each year. How much will your salary be after one year? Two years, five years,

2094
03:59:47,480 --> 03:59:54,200
and in general after t years. Let me chart out the information. The left column will be the

2095
03:59:54,200 --> 03:59:59,080
number of years since you're hired, and the right column will be your salary.

2096
04:00:00,920 --> 04:00:07,000
When you start work, that's zero years after you're hired, your salary will be $40,000.

2097
04:00:09,880 --> 04:00:17,000
After one year, you'll have gotten a 3% raise. So your salary will be the original 40,000

2098
04:00:17,640 --> 04:00:29,160
plus 3% of 40,000. 0.03 times 40,000. I can think of this first number as one times 40,000.

2099
04:00:29,720 --> 04:00:40,600
And I can factor out the 40,000 from both terms to get 40,000 times one plus 0.03.

2100
04:00:40,600 --> 04:00:50,440
Let me rewrite this as 40,000 times 1.03. This is your original salary

2101
04:00:51,240 --> 04:01:00,520
multiplied by a growth factor of 1.03. After two years, you'll get a 3% raise

2102
04:01:00,520 --> 04:01:07,480
from your previous year salary. Your previous year salary was 40,000 times 1.03,

2103
04:01:08,040 --> 04:01:17,880
but you'll add 3% of that. Again, I can think of the first number as one times 40,000 times 1.03.

2104
04:01:18,440 --> 04:01:27,080
And I can factor out the common factor of 40,000 times 1.03 from both terms to get 40,000

2105
04:01:27,960 --> 04:01:39,720
times 1.03 times one plus 0.03. Let me rewrite that as 40,000 times 1.03 times 1.03,

2106
04:01:40,360 --> 04:01:48,440
or 40,000 times 1.03 squared. We can think of this as your last year's salary

2107
04:01:49,240 --> 04:01:59,240
multiplied by the same growth factor of 1.03. After three years, a similar computation will

2108
04:01:59,240 --> 04:02:08,040
give you that your new salary is your previous year's salary times that growth factor of 1.03.

2109
04:02:09,160 --> 04:02:17,480
That can be written as 40,000 times 1.03 cubed. And in general, if you're noticing the pattern

2110
04:02:17,560 --> 04:02:27,640
after T years, your salary should be 40,000 times 1.03 to the T power. In other words, your salary

2111
04:02:27,640 --> 04:02:40,600
after T years is your original salary multiplied by the growth factor of 1.03 taken to the T power.

2112
04:02:40,920 --> 04:02:51,640
Let me write this as a formula. S of T, where S of T is your salary, is equal to 40,000 times 1.03

2113
04:02:51,640 --> 04:03:00,440
to the T. This is an exponential function, that is a function of the form A times B to the T,

2114
04:03:01,400 --> 04:03:13,000
where your initial value A is 40,000, and your base B is 1.03. Notice that your base

2115
04:03:13,000 --> 04:03:19,880
is the amount that your salary gets multiplied by each year. Given this formula, we can easily

2116
04:03:19,880 --> 04:03:25,560
figure out what your salary will be after, for example, five years by plugging in five for T.

2117
04:03:26,280 --> 04:03:35,080
I worked that out on my calculator to be 46,370 dollars and 96 cents to the nearest cent.

2118
04:03:37,400 --> 04:03:41,160
Exponential functions are also useful in modeling population growth.

2119
04:03:41,800 --> 04:03:48,360
The United Nations estimated that the world population in 2010 was 6.79 billion, growing at

2120
04:03:48,360 --> 04:03:53,880
a rate of 1.1 percent per year. Assuming that the growth rate stayed the same and will continue

2121
04:03:53,880 --> 04:04:00,200
to stay the same, we'll write an equation for the population at T years after the year 2010.

2122
04:04:02,280 --> 04:04:10,600
1.1 percent, written as a decimal, is 0.011. So if we work out a chart as before,

2123
04:04:11,800 --> 04:04:18,920
we see that after zero years since 2010, we have our initial population, 6.79 billion.

2124
04:04:19,480 --> 04:04:32,040
After one year, we'll take that 6.79 billion and add 1.1 percent of it, that is 0.011 times 6.79.

2125
04:04:32,760 --> 04:04:36,520
This works out to 6.79 times

2126
04:04:37,160 --> 04:04:50,200
1 plus 0.011 or 6.79 times 1.011. Here we have our initial population

2127
04:04:51,080 --> 04:05:01,720
of 6.79 billion and our growth factor of 1.011. That's how much the population

2128
04:05:01,720 --> 04:05:09,880
got multiplied by in one year. As before, we can work out that after two years,

2129
04:05:09,880 --> 04:05:20,040
our population becomes 6.79 times 1.011 squared since it got multiplied by 1.011 twice. And after

2130
04:05:20,040 --> 04:05:30,920
two years, it'll be 6.79 times 1.011 to the T power. So our function that models population

2131
04:05:32,280 --> 04:05:46,200
is going to be 6.79 times 1.011 to the T. Here, T represents time in years since 2010.

2132
04:05:47,160 --> 04:05:55,320
Just for fun, I'll plug in T equals 40. That's 40 years since 2010. So that's the year

2133
04:05:55,960 --> 04:06:06,680
2050. And I get 6.79 times 1.011 to the 40th power, which works out to 10.5 billion.

2134
04:06:07,480 --> 04:06:11,080
That's the prediction based on this exponential model.

2135
04:06:11,080 --> 04:06:18,520
The previous two examples were examples of exponential growth. This last example

2136
04:06:18,520 --> 04:06:24,200
is an example of exponential decay. The drug Cerroquel is metabolized and eliminated from the

2137
04:06:24,200 --> 04:06:32,440
body at a rate of 11% per hour. If 400 milligrams are given, how much remains in the body 24 hours

2138
04:06:32,440 --> 04:06:42,840
later? I'll chart out my information where the left column will be time in hours since the dose

2139
04:06:42,840 --> 04:06:49,960
was given. And the right column will be the number of milligrams of Cerroquel still in the body.

2140
04:06:51,400 --> 04:06:56,360
Zero hours after the dose is given, we have the full 400 milligrams in the body.

2141
04:06:57,240 --> 04:07:05,720
One hour later, we have the 400 milligrams minus 11% of it. That's minus 0.11 times 400.

2142
04:07:07,080 --> 04:07:19,480
If I factor out the 400 from both terms, I get 400 times 1 minus 0.11, or 400 times 0.89.

2143
04:07:20,360 --> 04:07:27,960
The 400 represents the initial amount. The 0.89, I'll call the growth factor,

2144
04:07:27,960 --> 04:07:33,320
even though in this case, the quantity is decreasing, not growing. So really, it's kind of a shrink factor.

2145
04:07:37,320 --> 04:07:45,000
Let's see what happens after two hours. Now I'll have 400 times 0.89. My previous amount,

2146
04:07:45,960 --> 04:07:53,640
it'll again get multiplied by 0.89. So that's going to be 400 times 0.89 squared. And in general,

2147
04:07:53,640 --> 04:08:01,240
after t hours, I'll have 400 multiplied by this growth or shrinkage factor of 0.89

2148
04:08:01,880 --> 04:08:09,080
raised to the t power. Since each hour, the amount of Cerroquel gets multiplied by 0.89,

2149
04:08:09,080 --> 04:08:17,080
that number less than one. I'll write my exponential decay function as f of t equals 400

2150
04:08:17,080 --> 04:08:26,600
times 0.89 to the t, where f of t represents the number of milligrams of Cerroquel in the body,

2151
04:08:27,560 --> 04:08:31,880
and t represents the number of hours since the dose was given.

2152
04:08:32,840 --> 04:08:39,480
To find out how much is in the body after 24 hours, I just plug in 24 for t.

2153
04:08:41,480 --> 04:08:49,000
This works out to about 24.4 milligrams. I hope you noticed the common form for the functions

2154
04:08:49,000 --> 04:08:55,800
used to model all three of these examples. The functions were always in the form f of t equals

2155
04:08:55,800 --> 04:09:05,560
a times b to the t, where a represented the initial amount, and b represented the growth factor.

2156
04:09:08,200 --> 04:09:13,880
To find the growth factor b, we started with the percent increase or decrease.

2157
04:09:15,080 --> 04:09:21,320
We wrote it as a decimal. And then we either added it or subtracted it from one,

2158
04:09:21,320 --> 04:09:27,160
depending on whether the quantity was increasing or decreasing. Let me show you that as a couple

2159
04:09:27,160 --> 04:09:37,960
examples. In the first example, we had a percent increase of 3% on the raise. As a decimal, I'll

2160
04:09:37,960 --> 04:09:47,880
call this r, this was 0.03. And to get the growth factor, we added that to 1 to get 1.03. In the

2161
04:09:47,880 --> 04:09:56,520
world population example, we had a 1.1% increase. We wrote this as 0.011 and added it to 1

2162
04:09:59,560 --> 04:10:10,760
to get 1.011. In the drug example, we had a decrease of 11%. We wrote that as a decimal.

2163
04:10:11,720 --> 04:10:23,400
And we subtracted the 0.11 from one to get 0.89. In fact, you can always write the

2164
04:10:23,400 --> 04:10:31,480
growth factor b as 1 plus the percent change written as a decimal. If you're careful to

2165
04:10:31,480 --> 04:10:37,320
make that percent change negative when the quantity is decreasing and positive when the

2166
04:10:37,320 --> 04:10:44,760
quantity is increasing, since here one plus negative 0.11 gives us the correct growth factor of 0.89,

2167
04:10:44,760 --> 04:10:51,480
which is less than one. As a good check, remember that if your quantity is increasing,

2168
04:10:52,920 --> 04:10:58,360
the base b should be bigger than one. And if the quantity is decreasing,

2169
04:10:59,800 --> 04:11:06,520
then b should be less than one. Exponential functions can also be used to model bank accounts

2170
04:11:06,520 --> 04:11:13,160
and loans with compound interest, as we'll see in another video. This video is about

2171
04:11:13,160 --> 04:11:20,520
interpreting exponential functions. An antique car is worth $50,000 now, and its value increases by

2172
04:11:20,520 --> 04:11:29,960
7% each year. Let's write an equation to model its value x years from now. After one year, its value

2173
04:11:30,200 --> 04:11:43,480
is the 50,000 plus 0.07 times the 50,000. That's because its value has grown by 7% or 0.07

2174
04:11:43,480 --> 04:11:54,600
times 50,000. This can be written as 50,000 times one plus 0.07. Notice that adding 7%

2175
04:11:55,560 --> 04:12:05,000
to the original value is the same as multiplying the original value by one plus 0.07, or by 1.07.

2176
04:12:06,840 --> 04:12:19,000
After two years, the value will be 50,000 times one plus 0.07 squared, or 50,000 times

2177
04:12:19,080 --> 04:12:26,920
1.07 squared. That's because the previous year's value is multiplied again by 1.07.

2178
04:12:28,680 --> 04:12:38,280
And in general, after x years, v of x, the antique car's value will be 50,000

2179
04:12:39,320 --> 04:12:48,760
times 1.07 to the x. That's because the original value of 50,000 gets multiplied by 1.07

2180
04:12:48,760 --> 04:12:54,840
x times one time for each year. If we dissect this equation, we see that the

2181
04:12:55,640 --> 04:13:03,240
number of 50,000 comes from the original value of the car. The 1.07, which I call the growth factor,

2182
04:13:04,920 --> 04:13:16,520
comes from 1 plus 0.07. The 0.07 being the percent increase written as a decimal.

2183
04:13:16,760 --> 04:13:24,840
So the form of this equation is an exponential equation, v of x equals a times b to the x,

2184
04:13:24,840 --> 04:13:33,000
where a is the initial value, and b is the growth factor. But we could also write this as a times

2185
04:13:33,000 --> 04:13:43,080
one plus r to the x, where a is still the initial value, but r is the percent increase written

2186
04:13:43,080 --> 04:13:51,640
as a decimal. This same equation will come up in the next example. Here, my Toyota Prius is

2187
04:13:51,640 --> 04:14:00,120
worth only 3,000 now, and its value is decreasing by 5% each year. So after one year, its value

2188
04:14:00,840 --> 04:14:16,120
will be 3,000 minus 0.05 times 3,000. That is 3,000 times 1 minus 0.05. I can also write that as

2189
04:14:16,120 --> 04:14:29,880
3,000 times 0.95. Decreasing the value by 5% is like multiplying the value by one minus 0.05 or by

2190
04:14:29,880 --> 04:14:43,080
0.95. After two years, the value will be multiplied by 0.95 again. So the value will be 3,000 times

2191
04:14:43,080 --> 04:14:55,240
0.95 squared. And after x years, the value will be 3,000 times 0.95 to the x. So my equation for

2192
04:14:55,240 --> 04:15:06,760
the value is 3,000 times 0.95 to the x. This is again an equation of the form v of x equals a

2193
04:15:06,760 --> 04:15:20,440
times b to the x, where here a is 3,000, the initial value, and b is 0.95. I'll still call that the

2194
04:15:20,440 --> 04:15:26,760
growth factor, even though we're actually declining in value, not growing. Now remember where this

2195
04:15:26,760 --> 04:15:36,520
0.95 came from, it came from taking one and subtracting 0.05 because of the 5% decrease in value.

2196
04:15:37,560 --> 04:15:44,600
So I can again write my equation in the form a times, well this time times 1 minus r to the x,

2197
04:15:45,320 --> 04:15:56,040
where r is our 0.05, that's our percent decrease written as a decimal. Please take a moment to

2198
04:15:56,040 --> 04:16:04,120
study this equation and the previous one. These say that when you have an exponential function,

2199
04:16:05,000 --> 04:16:12,200
the number here is the initial value. If it's written in this form, b is your growth factor,

2200
04:16:12,200 --> 04:16:18,760
but you can think of b as being either 1 minus r, where r is the percent decrease,

2201
04:16:18,760 --> 04:16:27,240
or 1 plus r, where r is the percent increase. In this example, we're given a function f of x

2202
04:16:27,240 --> 04:16:32,920
to model the number of bacteria in a Petri dish, x hours after 12 o'clock noon.

2203
04:16:34,360 --> 04:16:39,240
We want to know what was the number of bacteria at noon and by what percent the number of bacteria

2204
04:16:39,240 --> 04:16:45,720
is increasing every hour. We can see from the equation that the number of bacteria is increasing

2205
04:16:45,720 --> 04:16:51,880
and not decreasing because the base of the exponential function, 1.45, is bigger than 1.

2206
04:16:51,880 --> 04:17:02,680
Notice that our equation f of x equals 12 times 1.45 to the x has the form of a times b to the x,

2207
04:17:02,680 --> 04:17:14,680
or we can think of it as a times 1 plus r to the x. Here a is 12, b is 1.45, and r is 0.45.

2208
04:17:15,400 --> 04:17:23,000
Based on this familiar form, we can recognize that the initial amount of bacteria is going to be 12,

2209
04:17:23,800 --> 04:17:32,600
12,000, since those are our units. And this value 1.45 is our growth factor,

2210
04:17:33,720 --> 04:17:43,800
what the number of bacteria is multiplied by each hour, while r, the 0.45, is the rate of increase.

2211
04:17:43,800 --> 04:17:55,960
In other words, a 45 percent increase each hour. So our answers to the questions are 12,000 and 45

2212
04:17:55,960 --> 04:18:03,480
percent. In this example, the population of salamanders is modeled by this exponential function,

2213
04:18:04,200 --> 04:18:07,000
where x is the number of years since 2015.

2214
04:18:07,480 --> 04:18:16,440
Notice that the number of salamanders is decreasing, because the base of our exponential function,

2215
04:18:16,440 --> 04:18:25,080
0.78, is less than 1. So if we recognize the form of our exponential function, a times b to the x,

2216
04:18:25,080 --> 04:18:36,680
or we can think of this as a times 1 minus r to the x, where a is our initial value and r is our

2217
04:18:37,320 --> 04:18:47,640
decrease, written as a decimal. Our initial value is 3000. So that's the number of salamanders

2218
04:18:47,640 --> 04:18:59,640
zero years after 2015. Our growth factor b is 0.78. But if I write that as 1 minus r, I see that r

2219
04:18:59,640 --> 04:19:11,240
has to be 1 minus 0.78 or 0.22. In other words, our population is decreasing by 22 percent each year.

2220
04:19:12,600 --> 04:19:19,560
In this video, we saw that exponential functions can be written in the form f of x equals a times

2221
04:19:19,560 --> 04:19:27,320
b to the x, where a is the initial value, and b is the growth factor.

2222
04:19:29,400 --> 04:19:37,080
We also saw that they can be written in the form a times 1 plus r to the x, when the amount is

2223
04:19:37,080 --> 04:19:44,360
increasing, and as a times 1 minus r to the x, when the amount is decreasing.

2224
04:19:44,920 --> 04:19:54,200
In this format, r is the percent increase, or the percent decrease, written as a decimal.

2225
04:19:56,520 --> 04:20:10,840
So a 15 percent increase will be an r value of 0.15 and a growth factor b of 1.15, whereas a 12

2226
04:20:10,840 --> 04:20:26,200
percent decrease will be an r value of 0.12 and a b value of 1 minus 0.12 or 0.88.

2227
04:20:27,880 --> 04:20:34,680
These observations help us quickly interpret exponential functions. For example, here we have

2228
04:20:35,640 --> 04:20:45,080
an initial value of 100 and a 15 percent increase, and here we have an initial value of 50 and

2229
04:20:46,520 --> 04:20:48,680
a 40 percent decrease.

2230
04:20:50,680 --> 04:20:55,640
Exponential functions can be used to model compound interest for loans and bank accounts.

2231
04:20:56,760 --> 04:21:01,880
Suppose you invest $200 in a bank account that earns 3 percent interest every year.

2232
04:21:01,880 --> 04:21:08,760
If you make no deposits or withdrawals, how much money will you have accumulated after 10 years?

2233
04:21:10,120 --> 04:21:14,360
Because 3 percent of the money that's in the bank is getting added each year,

2234
04:21:14,360 --> 04:21:23,400
the money in the bank gets multiplied by 1.03 each year. So after one year, the amount will be

2235
04:21:23,400 --> 04:21:36,520
200 times 1.03 after two years, 200 times 1.03 squared, and after T years, 200 times 1.03 to

2236
04:21:36,520 --> 04:21:44,520
the T power. So the function modeling the amount of money, I'll call it P of T, is given by 200

2237
04:21:44,520 --> 04:21:51,080
times 1.03 to the T. More generally, if you invest A dollars

2238
04:21:53,160 --> 04:21:59,080
at an annual interest rate of R for T years,

2239
04:22:01,480 --> 04:22:07,800
in the end, you'll have P of T equals A times 1 plus R to the T.

2240
04:22:08,760 --> 04:22:17,080
Here, R needs to be written as a decimal, so 0.03 in our example for the 3 percent annual interest rate.

2241
04:22:18,440 --> 04:22:25,400
Going back to our specific example, after 10 years, the amount of money is going to be P of 10,

2242
04:22:25,400 --> 04:22:35,240
which is 200 times 1.03 to the 10, which works out to $268.78 to the nearest cent.

2243
04:22:35,320 --> 04:22:41,160
In this problem, we've assumed that the interest accumulates once per year. But in the next few

2244
04:22:41,160 --> 04:22:46,120
examples, we'll see what happens when the interest rate accumulates more frequently, twice a year,

2245
04:22:46,120 --> 04:22:54,120
or every month, for example. Let's deposit $300 in an account that earns 4.5 percent annual

2246
04:22:54,120 --> 04:23:00,120
interest compounded semi-annually. This means two times a year, or every six months.

2247
04:23:00,120 --> 04:23:12,920
A 4.5 percent annual interest rate compounded two times a year means that we're actually getting

2248
04:23:12,920 --> 04:23:21,560
4.5 over 2 percent interest every time the interest is compounded, that is, every six months.

2249
04:23:22,040 --> 04:23:38,280
That's 2.25 percent interest every half a year. Note that 2.25 percent is the same as 0.025 as a

2250
04:23:38,280 --> 04:23:51,000
decimal. So every time we earn interest, our money gets multiplied by 1.025. Let me make a chart of

2251
04:23:51,000 --> 04:23:59,960
what happens. After zero years, which is also zero half years, we have our original $300.

2252
04:24:00,920 --> 04:24:07,720
After a half a year, that's one half year, our money gets earns interest one time. So we multiply

2253
04:24:07,720 --> 04:24:17,560
the 300 by 1.025. After one year, that's two half years, our money earns interest two times.

2254
04:24:17,560 --> 04:24:29,640
So we multiply 300 by 1.0 225 squared. Continuing this way, after 1.5 years, that's three half years,

2255
04:24:30,200 --> 04:24:38,360
we have 300 times 1.0 225 cubed. And after two years, or four half years, we have 300 times

2256
04:24:38,360 --> 04:24:49,640
1.0 225 to the fourth. In general, after T years, which is two T half years, our money will grow to

2257
04:24:49,640 --> 04:25:01,160
300 times 1.0 225 to the two T power, because we've compounded interest two T times. Our formula for

2258
04:25:01,160 --> 04:25:10,200
our amount of money is P of T equals 300 times 1.0 225 to the two T, where T is the number of years.

2259
04:25:12,520 --> 04:25:22,680
To finish the problem, after seven years, we'll have P of $7, which is 300 times 1.0 225 to the

2260
04:25:22,680 --> 04:25:33,800
two times seven or 14 power. And that works out to $409.65 to the nearest cent.

2261
04:25:35,400 --> 04:25:41,800
In this next example, we're going to take out a loan for $1,200 at an annual interest rate of 6%

2262
04:25:42,360 --> 04:25:49,560
compounded monthly. Although loans and bank accounts might feel different, they're mathematically the

2263
04:25:49,560 --> 04:25:55,240
same. It's like from the bank's point of view, they're investing money in you and getting interest

2264
04:25:55,240 --> 04:26:03,880
on their money from you. So we can work them out with the same kind of math. 6% annual interest rate

2265
04:26:05,080 --> 04:26:13,000
compounded monthly means you're compounding 12 times a year. So each time you compound interest,

2266
04:26:13,000 --> 04:26:23,800
you're just going to get 6 over 12% interest. That's 0.5% interest. And as a decimal, that's

2267
04:26:24,360 --> 04:26:29,960
0.005. Let's chart out again what happens.

2268
04:26:32,280 --> 04:26:42,360
Time zero, of course, you'll have the original loan amount of 1200. After one year, that's 12 months,

2269
04:26:43,160 --> 04:26:53,640
your loan has had interest added to it 12 times. So it gets multiplied by 1.005 to the 12th.

2270
04:26:55,240 --> 04:27:03,720
After two years, that's 24 months, it's had interest added to it 24 times. So it gets

2271
04:27:03,720 --> 04:27:10,920
multiplied by 1.005 to the 24th power. Similarly, after three years or 36 months,

2272
04:27:11,480 --> 04:27:21,720
your loan amount will be 1200 times 1.005 to the 36th power. And in general, after T years,

2273
04:27:22,280 --> 04:27:31,560
that's 12 T months. So the interest will be compounded 12 T times. And so we have to raise

2274
04:27:31,560 --> 04:27:41,160
the 1.005 to the 12 T power. This gives us the general formula for the money owed is P of T equals

2275
04:27:41,720 --> 04:27:49,320
1200 times 1.005 to the 12 T, where T is the number of years.

2276
04:27:51,640 --> 04:28:00,280
In particular, after three years, we'll have to pay back a total of 1200 times 1.005

2277
04:28:00,280 --> 04:28:05,240
to the 12 times three or 36 power, which works out to

2278
04:28:07,240 --> 04:28:16,360
$1,436.02 to the nearest cent. These last two problems follow a general pattern.

2279
04:28:17,080 --> 04:28:25,800
If A is the initial amount of the loan or bank account, and R is the annual interest rate,

2280
04:28:26,120 --> 04:28:39,080
compounded N times per year, then our formula for the amount of money is going to be A times

2281
04:28:39,080 --> 04:28:48,520
1 plus R over N to the NT. This formula exactly matches what we did in this problem. First,

2282
04:28:48,520 --> 04:28:54,920
we took the interest rate R, which was 6%, and divided it by the number of compounding periods

2283
04:28:54,920 --> 04:29:02,680
each year, 12. We wrote that as a decimal and added one to it. That's where we got the 1.005

2284
04:29:02,680 --> 04:29:10,200
from. We raised this to not to the number of years, but to 12 times the number of years.

2285
04:29:10,200 --> 04:29:14,120
That's the number of compounding periods per year times the number of years.

2286
04:29:15,400 --> 04:29:19,720
And we multiplied all that by the initial amount of money, which was 1200.

2287
04:29:20,200 --> 04:29:25,080
This formula for compounded interest is a good one to memorize, but it's also important to be able

2288
04:29:25,080 --> 04:29:29,880
to reason your way through it, like we did in this chart. There's one more type of compounded

2289
04:29:29,880 --> 04:29:36,120
interest, and that's interest compounded continuously. You can think of continuous compounding

2290
04:29:36,120 --> 04:29:42,680
as the limit of compounding more and more frequently. 10 times a year, 100 times a year,

2291
04:29:42,680 --> 04:29:47,560
1,000 times a year, a million times a year. In the limit, you get continuous compounding.

2292
04:29:47,560 --> 04:29:56,760
The formula for continuous compounding is p of t equals a times e to the rt,

2293
04:29:57,480 --> 04:30:03,640
where p of t is the amount of money. t is the time in years.

2294
04:30:05,640 --> 04:30:08,120
a is the initial amount of money.

2295
04:30:10,120 --> 04:30:16,760
And r is the annual interest rate written as a decimal.

2296
04:30:17,720 --> 04:30:24,600
So 0.025 in this problem from the 2.5% annual interest rate.

2297
04:30:25,880 --> 04:30:32,280
e represents the famous constant Euler's constant, which is about 2.718.

2298
04:30:33,640 --> 04:30:43,480
So in this problem, we have p of t is 4,000 times e to the 0.025 t.

2299
04:30:43,720 --> 04:30:53,000
And after five years, we'll have p of 5, which is 4,000 times e to the 0.025 times 5,

2300
04:30:54,360 --> 04:31:01,000
which works out to $4,532.59 to the nearest cent.

2301
04:31:02,200 --> 04:31:08,200
To summarize, if r represents the annual interest rate written as a decimal,

2302
04:31:08,440 --> 04:31:20,120
that is 2% would be 0.02, and t represents the number of years, and a represents the initial

2303
04:31:20,120 --> 04:31:26,920
amount of money, then for just simple annual interest compounded once a year, our formula

2304
04:31:26,920 --> 04:31:35,560
is p of t is a times 1 plus r to the t. For compound interest compounded n times per year,

2305
04:31:36,280 --> 04:31:44,920
our formula is p of t is a times 1 plus r over n to the nt. And for compound interest

2306
04:31:44,920 --> 04:31:50,760
compounded continuously, we get p of t is a times e to the rt.

2307
04:31:52,760 --> 04:31:56,280
In this video, we looked at three kinds of compound interest problems.

2308
04:31:57,000 --> 04:32:04,680
Simple annual interest, interest compounded n times per year, and continuously compounded interest.

2309
04:32:06,520 --> 04:32:08,760
This video introduces logarithms.

2310
04:32:10,760 --> 04:32:19,960
Logarithms are a way of writing exponents. The expression log base a of b equals c means that

2311
04:32:19,960 --> 04:32:30,840
a to the c equals b. In other words, log base a of b is the exponent that you raise a to to get b.

2312
04:32:31,800 --> 04:32:38,040
The number a is called the base of the logarithm. It's also called the base when we write it in

2313
04:32:38,040 --> 04:32:45,000
this exponential form. Some students find it helpful to remember this relationship log base a of b

2314
04:32:45,000 --> 04:32:55,800
equals c means a to the c equals b by drawing arrows a to the c equals b. Other students like

2315
04:32:55,800 --> 04:33:05,880
to think of it in terms of asking a question. log base a of b asks, what power do you raise a to

2316
04:33:07,160 --> 04:33:17,800
in order to get b? Let's look at some examples. log base two of eight is three, because two

2317
04:33:17,880 --> 04:33:25,400
to the three equals eight. In general, log base two of y is asking you the question,

2318
04:33:26,040 --> 04:33:36,040
what power do you have to raise two to to get y? So for example, log base two of 16 is four,

2319
04:33:36,040 --> 04:33:42,120
because it's asking you the question to to what power equals 16. And the answer is four.

2320
04:33:43,080 --> 04:33:50,280
Please pause the video and try some of these other examples. log base two of two is asking,

2321
04:33:50,280 --> 04:33:55,480
what power do you raise two to to get two? And the answer is one.

2322
04:33:58,280 --> 04:34:07,800
two to the one equals two. log base two of one half is asking two to what power gives you one

2323
04:34:07,800 --> 04:34:14,760
half. Well, to get one half, you need to raise two to a negative power. So that would be two

2324
04:34:14,760 --> 04:34:23,240
to the negative one. So the answer is negative one. log base two of one eighth means what power do

2325
04:34:23,240 --> 04:34:32,520
we raise two to in order to get one eighth. Since one eighth is one over two cubed, we have to raise

2326
04:34:32,520 --> 04:34:41,080
two to the negative three power to get one over two cubed. So our exponent is negative three.

2327
04:34:41,080 --> 04:34:49,720
And that's our answer to our log expression. Finally, log base two of one is asking to to what

2328
04:34:49,720 --> 04:34:57,400
power equals one. Well, anything raised to the zero power gives us one. So this log expression

2329
04:34:57,400 --> 04:35:04,520
evaluates to zero. Notice that we can get positive negative and zero answers for our

2330
04:35:04,520 --> 04:35:10,520
logarithm expressions. Please pause the video and figure out what these logs evaluate to

2331
04:35:12,760 --> 04:35:17,960
to work out log base 10 of a million. Notice that a million

2332
04:35:19,560 --> 04:35:27,240
is 10 to the sixth power. Now we're asking the question, what power do we raise 10 to to get

2333
04:35:27,240 --> 04:35:32,920
a million? So that is what power do we raise 10 to to get 10 to the sixth? Well, of course,

2334
04:35:32,920 --> 04:35:42,840
the answer is going to be six. Similarly, since point 001 is 10 to the minus three,

2335
04:35:43,800 --> 04:35:49,720
this log expression is the same thing as asking what's log base 10 of 10 to the minus three.

2336
04:35:50,360 --> 04:35:56,440
Well, what power do you have to raise 10 to to get 10 to the minus three? Of course, the answer

2337
04:35:56,440 --> 04:36:05,800
is negative three. log base 10 of zero is asking, what power do we raise 10 to to get zero?

2338
04:36:07,160 --> 04:36:11,880
Well, if you think about it, there's no way to raise 10 to an exponent to get zero.

2339
04:36:11,880 --> 04:36:15,560
Raising 10 to a positive exponent gets us really big positive numbers.

2340
04:36:16,280 --> 04:36:21,560
Raising 10 to a negative exponent is like one over 10 to a power. So that's giving us

2341
04:36:21,560 --> 04:36:26,040
tiny fractions, but there's still positive numbers, we're never going to get zero.

2342
04:36:27,080 --> 04:36:32,600
Even if we raise 10 to the zero power, we'll just get one. So there's no way to get zero. And the

2343
04:36:32,600 --> 04:36:38,920
log base 10 of zero does not exist. If you tried on your calculator using the log base 10 button,

2344
04:36:38,920 --> 04:36:44,840
you'll get an error message. Same thing happens when we do log base 10 of negative 100, we're

2345
04:36:44,840 --> 04:36:49,640
asking 10 to what power equals negative 100. And there's no exponent that will work.

2346
04:36:51,640 --> 04:36:55,240
And more generally, it's possible to take the log of numbers that are

2347
04:36:55,880 --> 04:37:01,400
greater than zero, but not for numbers that are less than or equal to zero.

2348
04:37:02,200 --> 04:37:07,960
In other words, the domain of the function log base a of x, no matter what base you're using for

2349
04:37:07,960 --> 04:37:16,920
a, the domain is going to be all positive numbers. A few notes on notation. When you see ln of x,

2350
04:37:16,920 --> 04:37:23,800
that's called natural log, and it means the log base e of x, where e is that famous number that's

2351
04:37:23,800 --> 04:37:33,160
about 2.718. When you see log of x with no base at all, by convention, that means log base 10 of x,

2352
04:37:33,160 --> 04:37:40,120
and it's called the common log. Most scientific calculators have buttons for natural log and for

2353
04:37:40,120 --> 04:37:48,360
common log. Let's practice rewriting expressions with logs in them. log base three of one ninth

2354
04:37:48,360 --> 04:37:55,960
is negative two can be rewritten as the expression three to the negative two equals one ninth.

2355
04:37:58,760 --> 04:38:06,600
log of 13 is shorthand for log base 10 of 13. So that can be rewritten as 10

2356
04:38:07,240 --> 04:38:18,520
to the 1.11394 equals 13. Finally, in this last expression, ln means natural log or log base e.

2357
04:38:18,520 --> 04:38:26,200
So I can rewrite this equation as log base e of one over e equals negative one. Well, that means

2358
04:38:26,200 --> 04:38:34,760
the same thing as e to the negative one equals one over e, which is true. Now let's go the opposite

2359
04:38:34,760 --> 04:38:42,200
direction. We'll start with exponential equations and rewrite them as logs. Remember that log base

2360
04:38:42,200 --> 04:38:51,400
a of b equals c means the same thing as a to the c equals b. The base stays the same in both

2361
04:38:51,400 --> 04:38:59,240
expressions. So for this example, the base of three in the exponential equation is going to be the

2362
04:38:59,240 --> 04:39:04,760
same as the base in our log. Now I just have to figure out what's in the argument of the log

2363
04:39:05,400 --> 04:39:11,800
and what goes on the other side of the equal sign. Remember that the answer to a log is an exponent.

2364
04:39:12,760 --> 04:39:18,120
So the thing that goes in this box should be my exponent for my exponential equation. In other

2365
04:39:18,120 --> 04:39:30,920
words, you and I'll put the 9.78 as the argument of my log. This works because log base three of

2366
04:39:30,920 --> 04:39:39,480
9.78 equals you means the same thing as three to the you equals 9.78, which is just what we started

2367
04:39:39,480 --> 04:39:48,040
with. In a second example, the base of my exponential equation is e. So the base of my log is going to

2368
04:39:48,040 --> 04:39:56,280
be e. The answer to my log is an exponent. In this case, the exponent three x plus seven.

2369
04:39:58,920 --> 04:40:06,840
And the other expression, the four minus y becomes my argument of my log. Let me check

2370
04:40:08,360 --> 04:40:15,240
log base e of four minus y equals three x plus seven means e to the three x plus seven equals four

2371
04:40:15,240 --> 04:40:21,720
minus y, which is just what I started with. I can also rewrite log base e as natural log.

2372
04:40:24,440 --> 04:40:30,760
This video introduced the idea of logs and the fact that log base a of b equals c

2373
04:40:31,800 --> 04:40:41,320
means the same thing as a to the c equals b. So log base a of b is asking the question

2374
04:40:41,960 --> 04:40:46,440
what power or exponent do you raise a to in order to get b?

2375
04:40:48,760 --> 04:40:53,560
In this video, we'll work out the graphs of some log functions and also talk about their domains.

2376
04:40:55,240 --> 04:41:00,520
For this first example, let's graph a log function by hand by plotting some points.

2377
04:41:01,640 --> 04:41:08,280
The function we're working with is y equals log base two of x. I'll make a chart of x and y values.

2378
04:41:09,240 --> 04:41:12,680
Since we're working this out by hand, I want to pick x values

2379
04:41:12,680 --> 04:41:19,240
for which it's easy to compute log base two of x. So I'll start out with the x value of one

2380
04:41:19,240 --> 04:41:24,920
because log base two of one is zero, log base anything of one is zero.

2381
04:41:26,840 --> 04:41:33,400
Two is another x value that's easy to compute log base two of two, that's asking what power do I

2382
04:41:33,400 --> 04:41:37,240
raise two to to get two? Well, and the answer is one.

2383
04:41:39,160 --> 04:41:46,680
Other powers of two are easy to work with. So for example, log base two of four, that's saying

2384
04:41:46,680 --> 04:41:53,640
what power do I raise two to to get four? So the answer is two. Similarly, log base two of eight

2385
04:41:53,640 --> 04:42:01,320
is three, and log base two of 16 is four. Let me also work with some fractional values for x.

2386
04:42:02,120 --> 04:42:09,640
If x is one half, then log base two of one half, that's saying what power do I raise two to

2387
04:42:09,640 --> 04:42:16,440
to get one half? Well, that needs a power of negative one. It's also easy to compute by hand

2388
04:42:17,480 --> 04:42:25,000
the log base two of one fourth and one eighth log base two of one fourth is negative two since

2389
04:42:25,640 --> 04:42:33,480
two to the negative two is one fourth. And similarly, log base two of one eighth is negative three.

2390
04:42:34,280 --> 04:42:39,720
I'll put some tick marks on my x and y axes. Please pause the video and take a moment to

2391
04:42:39,720 --> 04:42:49,320
plot these points. Let's see, I have the point one zero. That's here to one. That's here for two.

2392
04:42:50,280 --> 04:42:59,720
That is here. And then eight three, which is here. And the fractional x values one half goes

2393
04:42:59,720 --> 04:43:06,520
with negative one, and one fourth with negative two, one eighth with negative three. And if I

2394
04:43:06,520 --> 04:43:12,840
connect the dots, I get a graph that looks something like this. If I had smaller and smaller

2395
04:43:12,840 --> 04:43:18,360
fractions, I would keep getting more and more negative answers when I took log base two of

2396
04:43:18,360 --> 04:43:24,360
them. So my graph is getting more and more negative, my y values are getting more and more negative

2397
04:43:25,160 --> 04:43:30,760
as x is getting close to zero. Now I didn't draw any parts of the graph over here with

2398
04:43:30,760 --> 04:43:37,080
negative x values, and I didn't put any negative x values in my chart. That omission is is no accident

2399
04:43:37,080 --> 04:43:44,040
because if you try to take the log base two or base anything of a negative number, like say negative

2400
04:43:44,600 --> 04:43:52,200
four or something, there's no answer. This doesn't exist because there's no power that you can raise

2401
04:43:52,840 --> 04:44:00,920
two two to get a negative number. So there are no points on the graph for negative x values. And

2402
04:44:00,920 --> 04:44:07,720
similarly, there are no points on the graph where x is zero, because you can't take log base two of

2403
04:44:07,720 --> 04:44:15,080
zero, there's no power you can raise two to to get zero. I want to observe some key features of

2404
04:44:15,080 --> 04:44:24,280
this graph. First of all, the domain is x values greater than zero. In interval notation, I can

2405
04:44:24,280 --> 04:44:32,760
write that as a round bracket because I don't want to include zero to infinity. The range is going to

2406
04:44:32,760 --> 04:44:39,800
be the y values. Well, they go all the way down into the far reach of the negative numbers. And the

2407
04:44:39,800 --> 04:44:46,840
graph gradually increases y values getting bigger and bigger. So the range is actually all real numbers

2408
04:44:48,280 --> 04:44:53,320
or an interval notation negative infinity to infinity. Finally, I want to point out that

2409
04:44:53,320 --> 04:45:04,760
this graph has a vertical asymptote at the y axis, that is at the line x equals zero.

2410
04:45:06,040 --> 04:45:11,880
I'll draw that on my graph with a dotted line. A vertical asymptote is a line that

2411
04:45:11,880 --> 04:45:18,920
our functions graph gets closer and closer to. So this is the graph of y equals log base two of x.

2412
04:45:18,920 --> 04:45:27,800
But if I wanted to graph say, y equals log base 10 of x, it would look very similar. It would still

2413
04:45:27,800 --> 04:45:33,800
have a domain of x values greater than zero, a range of all real numbers, and a vertical asymptote

2414
04:45:33,800 --> 04:45:40,840
at the y axis. It would still go through the point one zero, but it would go through the point 10 one

2415
04:45:41,480 --> 04:45:51,000
instead, because log base 10 of 10 is one. It would look pretty much the same, just a lot flatter

2416
04:45:51,000 --> 04:45:57,960
over here. But even though it doesn't look like it with the way I've drawn it, it still gradually

2417
04:45:57,960 --> 04:46:08,360
goes up to and towards infinity. In fact, the graph of y equals log base any a of x for a bigger than

2418
04:46:08,360 --> 04:46:16,280
one looks pretty much the same, and has the same three properties. Now that we know what the basic

2419
04:46:16,280 --> 04:46:21,240
log graph looks like, we can plot at least rough graphs of other log functions without plotting

2420
04:46:21,240 --> 04:46:28,120
points. Here we have the graph of natural log of x plus five. And again, I'm just going to draw a

2421
04:46:28,120 --> 04:46:32,200
rough graph. If I did want to do a more accurate graph, I probably would want to plot some points.

2422
04:46:32,840 --> 04:46:41,000
But I know that roughly a log graph, if it was just like y equals ln of x, that would look something

2423
04:46:41,000 --> 04:46:48,360
like this, and it would go through the point one zero with a vertical asymptote along the y axis.

2424
04:46:49,560 --> 04:46:56,120
Now if I want to graph ln of x plus five, that just shifts our graph up by five units. It'll still

2425
04:46:56,120 --> 04:47:00,920
have the same vertical asymptote since a vertical line shifted up by five units is still a vertical

2426
04:47:00,920 --> 04:47:08,280
line. But instead of going through one zero, it'll go through the point one five. So I'll draw a rough

2427
04:47:08,280 --> 04:47:17,640
sketch here. Let's compare our starting function, y equals ln x, and the transformed version,

2428
04:47:17,640 --> 04:47:25,240
y equals ln x plus five, in terms of the domain, the range, and the vertical asymptote.

2429
04:47:25,480 --> 04:47:34,360
Our original function, y equals ln x had a domain of zero to infinity. Since adding five on the

2430
04:47:34,360 --> 04:47:41,960
outside affects the y values, and the domain is the x values, this transformation doesn't change

2431
04:47:41,960 --> 04:47:50,360
the domain. So the domain is still from zero to infinity. Now the range of our original y equals

2432
04:47:50,360 --> 04:47:57,560
ln x was from negative infinity to infinity. Shifting up by five does affect the y values,

2433
04:47:57,560 --> 04:48:03,320
and the range is talking about the y values. But since the original range was all real numbers,

2434
04:48:03,320 --> 04:48:08,040
if you add five to all set of all real numbers, you still get the set of all real numbers. So in

2435
04:48:08,040 --> 04:48:14,440
this case, the range doesn't change either. And finally, we already saw that the original vertical

2436
04:48:14,440 --> 04:48:20,520
asymptote of the y axis x equals zero, when we shift that up by five units, it's still the vertical

2437
04:48:20,520 --> 04:48:28,920
line x equals zero. In this next example, we're starting with a log base 10 function. And since

2438
04:48:28,920 --> 04:48:37,000
the plus two is on the inside, that means we shift that graph left by two. So I'll draw our basic log

2439
04:48:37,320 --> 04:48:44,920
function. Here's our basic log function. So I'll think of that as y equals log of x going

2440
04:48:44,920 --> 04:48:51,880
through the point one zero. Here's its vertical asymptote. Now I need to shift everything left

2441
04:48:51,880 --> 04:49:00,600
by two. So my vertical asymptote shifts left. And now it's at the line x equals negative two instead

2442
04:49:01,080 --> 04:49:10,120
of at x equals zero. And my graph, well, let's see my point one zero gets shifted to, let's say

2443
04:49:10,120 --> 04:49:18,920
negative one zero, since I'm subtracting two from the x's. And here's a rough sketch of the resulting

2444
04:49:18,920 --> 04:49:28,600
graph. Let's compare the features of the two graphs drawn here. We're talking about domains. The

2445
04:49:28,600 --> 04:49:36,920
original had a domain of from zero to infinity. But now I've shifted that left. So I've subtracted

2446
04:49:36,920 --> 04:49:42,120
two from all my x values. And here's my new domain, which I can also verify just by looking at the

2447
04:49:42,120 --> 04:49:50,920
picture. My range was originally from negative infinity to infinity. Well, shifting left only

2448
04:49:50,920 --> 04:49:55,480
affects the x value. So it doesn't even affect the range. So my range is still negative infinity

2449
04:49:55,640 --> 04:50:03,160
to infinity. My vertical asymptote was originally at x equals zero. And since I subtract two from

2450
04:50:03,160 --> 04:50:09,160
all my x values, that shifts it to x equals negative two. In this last problem, I'm not

2451
04:50:09,160 --> 04:50:14,920
going to worry about drawing this graph. I'll just use algebra to compute its domain. So let's

2452
04:50:14,920 --> 04:50:20,760
think about what's the issue when you're taking the logs of things? Well, you can't take the log

2453
04:50:20,760 --> 04:50:27,160
of a negative number or zero. So whatever's inside the argument of the log function, whatever's

2454
04:50:27,160 --> 04:50:35,640
being fed into log had better be greater than zero. So I'll write that down. We need two minus three x

2455
04:50:35,640 --> 04:50:41,560
to be greater than zero. Now it's a matter of solving an inequality. Two has got to be greater

2456
04:50:41,560 --> 04:50:48,360
than three x. So two thirds is greater than x. In other words, x has to be less than two thirds.

2457
04:50:48,360 --> 04:50:55,720
So our domain is all the x values from negative infinity to two thirds, not including two thirds.

2458
04:50:57,080 --> 04:51:01,880
It's a good idea to memorize the basic shape of the graph of a log function.

2459
04:51:03,960 --> 04:51:09,480
It looks something like this goes through the point one zero and has a vertical asymptote

2460
04:51:09,480 --> 04:51:14,120
on the y axis. Also, if you remember that you can't take the log

2461
04:51:14,360 --> 04:51:22,520
of a negative number or zero, then that helps you quickly compute domains for log functions.

2462
04:51:24,680 --> 04:51:29,560
Whatever's inside the log function, you set that greater than zero and solve.

2463
04:51:33,080 --> 04:51:38,760
This video is about combining functions by adding them, subtracting them, multiplying them, and

2464
04:51:38,760 --> 04:51:45,960
dividing them. Suppose we have two functions f of x equals x plus one and g of x equals x squared.

2465
04:51:47,320 --> 04:51:55,560
One way to combine them is by adding them together. This notation f plus g of x means the function

2466
04:51:55,560 --> 04:52:05,400
defined by taking f of x and adding it to g of x. So for our functions, that means we take x plus one

2467
04:52:05,400 --> 04:52:11,400
and add x squared. I can rearrange that as the function x squared plus x plus one.

2468
04:52:13,000 --> 04:52:19,800
So f plus g evaluated on x means x squared plus x plus one.

2469
04:52:20,760 --> 04:52:28,280
And if I wanted to evaluate f plus g on the number two, that would be two squared plus two plus one

2470
04:52:28,280 --> 04:52:38,280
or seven. Similarly, the notation f minus g of x means the function we get by taking f of x and

2471
04:52:38,280 --> 04:52:45,080
subtracting g of x. So that would be x plus one minus x squared. And if I wanted to take

2472
04:52:45,800 --> 04:52:54,680
f minus g evaluated at one, that would be one plus one minus one squared or one.

2473
04:52:55,880 --> 04:53:02,520
The notation f dot g of x, which is sometimes also written just as f g of x,

2474
04:53:03,080 --> 04:53:11,800
that means we take f of x times g of x. In other words, x plus one times x squared,

2475
04:53:11,800 --> 04:53:15,080
which could be simplified as x cube plus x squared.

2476
04:53:16,920 --> 04:53:27,080
The notation f divided by g of x means I take f of x and divide it by g of x. So that would be x

2477
04:53:27,080 --> 04:53:37,080
plus one divided by x squared. In this figure, the blue graph represents h of x. And the red

2478
04:53:37,080 --> 04:53:43,480
graph represents the function p of x. We're asked to find h minus p of zero.

2479
04:53:45,720 --> 04:53:50,600
We don't have any equations to work with, but that's okay. We know that for any x,

2480
04:53:51,160 --> 04:54:00,040
h minus p of x is defined as h of x minus p of x. So for x equals zero, h minus p of zero

2481
04:54:00,040 --> 04:54:06,760
is going to be h of zero minus p of zero. Using the graph, we can find h of zero

2482
04:54:07,560 --> 04:54:15,240
by finding the value of zero on the x axis and finding the corresponding y value for the function

2483
04:54:15,240 --> 04:54:25,240
h of x. So that's about 1.8. Now p of zero, we can find similarly by looking for zero on the x axis

2484
04:54:25,240 --> 04:54:30,440
and finding the corresponding y value for the function p of x. And that's a y value of one.

2485
04:54:31,800 --> 04:54:38,680
1.8 minus one is 0.8. So that's our approximate value for h minus p of zero.

2486
04:54:40,680 --> 04:54:48,920
If we want to find p times h of negative three, again, we can rewrite that as p of negative three

2487
04:54:48,920 --> 04:54:55,800
times h of negative three. And using the graphs, we see that for an x value of negative three,

2488
04:54:55,800 --> 04:55:06,600
the y value for p is two. And the x value of negative three corresponds to a y value of negative

2489
04:55:06,600 --> 04:55:14,920
two for h. Two times negative two is negative four. So that's our value for p times h of negative

2490
04:55:14,920 --> 04:55:22,200
three. In this video, we saw how to add two functions, subtract two functions, multiply two

2491
04:55:22,200 --> 04:55:31,240
functions, and divide two functions in the following way. When you compose two functions,

2492
04:55:31,880 --> 04:55:39,080
you apply the first function. And then you apply the second function to the output of the first

2493
04:55:39,080 --> 04:55:47,000
function. For example, the first function might compute population size from time in years.

2494
04:55:47,960 --> 04:55:54,680
So its input would be time in years, since a certain date, and its output would be

2495
04:55:54,680 --> 04:56:03,160
number of people in the population. The second function g might compute healthcare costs

2496
04:56:03,880 --> 04:56:11,800
as a function of population size. So it will take population size as input, and its output

2497
04:56:11,800 --> 04:56:18,360
will be healthcare costs. If you put these functions together, that is, compose them,

2498
04:56:18,360 --> 04:56:25,000
then you'll go all the way from time in years to healthcare costs. This is your composition,

2499
04:56:25,720 --> 04:56:33,720
g composed with f. The composition of two functions, written g with a little circle

2500
04:56:33,720 --> 04:56:43,560
f of x, is defined as follows. g composed with f of x is g evaluated on f of x.

2501
04:56:44,600 --> 04:56:51,000
We can think of it schematically in this diagram. f acts on a number x and produces

2502
04:56:51,000 --> 04:57:00,520
a number f of x. Then g takes that output f of x and produces a new number g of f of x.

2503
04:57:01,800 --> 04:57:06,680
Our composition of functions g composed with f is the function that goes all the way from x

2504
04:57:07,320 --> 04:57:14,920
to g of f of x. Let's work out some examples where our functions are defined by tables of values.

2505
04:57:15,880 --> 04:57:24,840
If we want to find g composed with f of four, by definition, this means g of f of four.

2506
04:57:25,800 --> 04:57:32,520
To evaluate this expression, we always work from the inside out. So we start with the x value of four

2507
04:57:33,160 --> 04:57:39,880
and we find f of four using the table of values for f of x. When x equals four,

2508
04:57:40,840 --> 04:57:46,760
f of x is seven. So we can replace f of four with the number seven.

2509
04:57:47,960 --> 04:57:55,400
Now we need to evaluate g of seven. Seven becomes our new x value in our table of values for g.

2510
04:57:56,280 --> 04:58:04,040
The x value of seven corresponds to the g of x value of ten. So g of seven is equal to ten.

2511
04:58:04,360 --> 04:58:12,360
We found that g composed with f of four is equal to ten. If instead we want to find f composed with g

2512
04:58:12,360 --> 04:58:21,400
of four, well we can rewrite that as f of g of four and again work from the inside out. Now we're

2513
04:58:21,400 --> 04:58:29,080
trying to find g of four. So four is our x value and we use our table of values for g to see that g

2514
04:58:29,240 --> 04:58:38,440
of four is one. So we replace g of four by one and now we need to evaluate f of one. Using our

2515
04:58:38,440 --> 04:58:49,400
table for f values, f of one is eight. Notice that when we've computed g of f of four, we got a

2516
04:58:49,400 --> 04:58:57,480
different answer than when we computed f of g of four. And in general, g composed with f is not the

2517
04:58:58,280 --> 04:59:04,280
same thing as f composed with g. Please pause the video and take a moment to compute the next two

2518
04:59:04,280 --> 04:59:12,840
examples. We can replace f composed with f of two by the equivalent expression f of f of two.

2519
04:59:13,800 --> 04:59:21,720
Working from the inside out, we know that f of two is three and f of three is six.

2520
04:59:22,040 --> 04:59:30,040
If we want to find f composed with g of six, rewrite that as f of g of six using the table

2521
04:59:30,040 --> 04:59:41,880
for g, g of six is eight. But f of eight, eight is not on the table as an x value for the for the f

2522
04:59:41,880 --> 04:59:50,360
function. And so there is no f of eight. This does not exist. We can say that six is not

2523
04:59:50,600 --> 05:00:02,120
in the domain for f composed with g. Even though it was in the domain of g, we couldn't follow all

2524
05:00:02,120 --> 05:00:09,000
the way through and get a value for f composed with g of six. Next, let's turn our attention to

2525
05:00:09,000 --> 05:00:15,960
the composition of functions that are given by equations. p of x is x squared plus x and q of

2526
05:00:15,960 --> 05:00:24,600
x is negative two x. We want to find q composed with p of one. As usual, I can rewrite this as q

2527
05:00:24,600 --> 05:00:35,320
of p of one and work from the inside out. p of one is one squared plus one. So that's two.

2528
05:00:36,200 --> 05:00:44,760
So this is the same thing as q of two. But q of two is negative two times two or negative four.

2529
05:00:44,760 --> 05:00:51,480
So this evaluates to negative four. In this next example, we want to find q composed with p of some

2530
05:00:51,480 --> 05:01:01,880
arbitrary x. I'll rewrite it as usual as q of p of x and work from the inside out. Well, p of x,

2531
05:01:02,440 --> 05:01:09,000
we know the formula for that, that's x squared plus x. So I can replace my p of x with that

2532
05:01:09,000 --> 05:01:18,520
expression. Now, I'm stuck with evaluating q on x squared plus x. Well, q of anything is negative

2533
05:01:18,520 --> 05:01:26,920
two times that thing. So q of x squared plus x is going to be negative two times the quantity

2534
05:01:26,920 --> 05:01:33,080
x squared plus x. What I've done is I've substituted in the whole expression x squared plus x,

2535
05:01:33,160 --> 05:01:39,160
where I saw the x in this formula for q of x. It's important to use the parentheses here so

2536
05:01:39,160 --> 05:01:43,800
that we'll be multiplying negative two by the whole expression and not just by the first piece.

2537
05:01:44,680 --> 05:01:50,760
I can simplify this a bit as negative two x squared minus two x. And that's my expression

2538
05:01:51,320 --> 05:01:58,440
for q composed with p of x. Notice that if I wanted to compute q composed with p of one,

2539
05:01:59,400 --> 05:02:05,080
which I already did in the first problem, I could just use this expression now negative two times

2540
05:02:05,080 --> 05:02:12,920
one squared minus two, and I get negative four, just like I did before. Let's try another one.

2541
05:02:12,920 --> 05:02:21,240
Let's try p composed with q of x. First, I read write this p of q of x working from the inside

2542
05:02:21,240 --> 05:02:27,880
out, I can replace q of x with negative two x. So I need to compute p of negative two x.

2543
05:02:29,400 --> 05:02:36,200
Here's my formula for p to compute p of this expression, I need to plug in this expression

2544
05:02:36,200 --> 05:02:45,800
everywhere I see an x in the formula for p. So that means negative two x squared plus negative

2545
05:02:45,800 --> 05:02:51,080
two x. Again, being careful to use parentheses to make sure I plug in the entire expression

2546
05:02:51,640 --> 05:03:01,160
in for x. Let me simplify, this is four x squared minus two x. Notice that I got different expressions

2547
05:03:01,720 --> 05:03:11,720
for q of p of x, and for p of q of x. Once again, we see that q composed with p is not

2548
05:03:11,720 --> 05:03:19,000
necessarily equal to p composed with q. Please pause the video and try this last example yourself.

2549
05:03:19,880 --> 05:03:29,800
Rewriting and working from the inside out, we can replace p of x with its expression x squared

2550
05:03:29,800 --> 05:03:39,400
plus x. And then we need to evaluate p on x squared plus x. That means we plug in x squared plus x

2551
05:03:40,120 --> 05:03:45,960
everywhere we see an x in this formula. So that's x squared plus x quantity squared plus

2552
05:03:46,600 --> 05:03:53,960
x squared plus x. Once again, I can simplify by distributing out that gives me x to the fourth

2553
05:03:53,960 --> 05:04:03,320
plus two x cubed plus x squared plus x squared plus x or x to the fourth plus two x cubed plus

2554
05:04:03,320 --> 05:04:11,400
two x squared plus x. In this last set of examples, we're asked to go backwards. We're given a formula

2555
05:04:11,400 --> 05:04:18,120
for a function of h of x, but we're supposed to rewrite h of x as a composition of two functions

2556
05:04:18,120 --> 05:04:24,200
f and g. Let's think for a minute, which of these two functions gets applied first?

2557
05:04:24,840 --> 05:04:33,320
f composed with g of x, let's see, that means f of g of x. And since we evaluate these expressions

2558
05:04:33,320 --> 05:04:41,720
from the inside out, we must be applying g first, and then f. In order to figure out what

2559
05:04:41,720 --> 05:04:48,200
f and g could be, I like to draw a box around something inside my expression for h. So I'm

2560
05:04:48,200 --> 05:04:54,040
going to draw a box around x squared plus seven. Then whatever's inside the box, that'll be my

2561
05:04:54,040 --> 05:04:59,720
function g of x the first function that gets applied. Whatever happens to the box, in this case

2562
05:04:59,720 --> 05:05:07,880
taking the square root sign, that becomes my outside function, my second function f. So here,

2563
05:05:07,880 --> 05:05:15,320
we're going to say g of x is equal to x squared plus seven. And f of x is equal to the square root

2564
05:05:15,320 --> 05:05:21,400
of x. Let's just check and make sure that this works. So I need to check that when I take the

2565
05:05:21,400 --> 05:05:31,240
composition, f composed with g, I need to get the same thing as my original h. So let's see,

2566
05:05:31,240 --> 05:05:39,880
if I do f composed with g of x, well by definition, that's f of g of x, working from the inside out,

2567
05:05:39,880 --> 05:05:46,600
I can replace g of x with its formula x squared plus seven. So I need to evaluate f of x squared

2568
05:05:46,600 --> 05:05:55,800
plus seven. That means I plug in x squared plus seven into the formula for for f. So that becomes

2569
05:05:55,800 --> 05:06:01,720
the square root of x squared plus seven. Tada, it works because it matches my original equation.

2570
05:06:02,680 --> 05:06:07,800
So we found a correct answer, a correct way of breaking h down as a composition of two functions.

2571
05:06:07,800 --> 05:06:14,200
But I do want to point out, this is not the only correct answer. I'll write down my formula for h

2572
05:06:14,280 --> 05:06:19,880
of x again. And this time I'll put the box in a different place. I'll just box the x squared.

2573
05:06:20,680 --> 05:06:30,440
If I did that, then my inside function, my first function g of x would be x squared. And my second

2574
05:06:30,440 --> 05:06:38,680
function is what happens to the box. So my f of x is what happens to the box. And the box gets

2575
05:06:39,320 --> 05:06:45,320
added seven to it and taken the square root. So in other words, f of x is going to be

2576
05:06:46,120 --> 05:06:53,640
the square root of x plus seven. Again, I can check that this works. If I do f composed with

2577
05:06:53,640 --> 05:07:01,560
g of x, that's f of g of x. So now g of x is x squared. So I'm taking f of x squared. When I

2578
05:07:01,560 --> 05:07:07,880
plug in x squared for x, I do in fact get the square root of x squared plus seven. So this is

2579
05:07:07,880 --> 05:07:15,960
an alternative correct solution. In this video, we learned to evaluate the composition of functions

2580
05:07:16,920 --> 05:07:24,520
by rewriting it and working from the inside out. We also learned to break apart a complicated

2581
05:07:24,520 --> 05:07:33,000
function into a composition of two functions by boxing one piece of the function. And letting

2582
05:07:33,000 --> 05:07:38,760
the first function applied in the composition, let that be the inside of the box. And the second

2583
05:07:38,760 --> 05:07:41,960
function applied in the composition be whatever happens to the box.

2584
05:07:42,360 --> 05:07:59,000
The inverse of a function undoes what the function does. So the inverse of tying your shoes would

2585
05:07:59,000 --> 05:08:07,640
be to untie them. And the inverse of the function that adds two to a number would be the function

2586
05:08:07,640 --> 05:08:13,480
that subtracts two from a number. This video introduces inverses and their properties.

2587
05:08:14,600 --> 05:08:20,840
Suppose f of x is the function defined by this chart. In other words, f of two is three,

2588
05:08:20,840 --> 05:08:29,320
f of three is five, f of four is six, and f of five is one. The inverse function for f,

2589
05:08:29,320 --> 05:08:37,400
written f superscript negative one x undoes what f does. Since f takes two to three,

2590
05:08:38,520 --> 05:08:46,440
f inverse takes three back to two. So we write this f superscript negative one of three is two.

2591
05:08:48,360 --> 05:08:55,560
Similarly, since f takes three to five, f inverse takes five to three.

2592
05:08:56,120 --> 05:09:04,840
And since f takes four to six, f inverse of six is four. And since f takes five to one,

2593
05:09:04,840 --> 05:09:12,200
f inverse of one is five. I'll use these numbers to fill in the chart. Notice that the chart of

2594
05:09:12,200 --> 05:09:19,080
values when y equals f of x and the chart of values when y equals f inverse of x are closely

2595
05:09:19,960 --> 05:09:27,480
related. They share the same numbers, but the x values for f of x correspond to the y values

2596
05:09:27,480 --> 05:09:34,840
for f inverse of x. And the y values for f of x correspond to the x values for f inverse of x.

2597
05:09:35,800 --> 05:09:41,080
That leads us to the first key fact. Inverse functions reverse the roles of y and x.

2598
05:09:41,560 --> 05:09:49,160
I'm going to plot the points for y equals f of x in blue. Next, I'll plot the points for y equals f

2599
05:09:49,160 --> 05:09:55,480
inverse of x in red. Pause the video for a moment and see what kind of symmetry you observe in this

2600
05:09:55,480 --> 05:10:01,160
graph. How are the blue points related to the red points? You might have noticed that the blue

2601
05:10:01,160 --> 05:10:09,880
points and the red points are mirror images over the mirror line y equals x. So our second key fact

2602
05:10:10,520 --> 05:10:16,920
is that the graph of y equals f inverse of x can be obtained from the graph of y equals f of x by

2603
05:10:16,920 --> 05:10:25,800
reflecting over the line y equals x. This makes sense because inverses reverse the roles of y and x.

2604
05:10:27,560 --> 05:10:34,920
In this same example, let's compute f inverse of f of two. This open circle means composition. In

2605
05:10:35,320 --> 05:10:43,160
other words, we're computing f inverse of f of two. We compute this from the inside out. So that's

2606
05:10:43,160 --> 05:10:57,800
f inverse of three, since f of two is three, and f inverse of three, we see as two. Similarly, we can

2607
05:10:57,880 --> 05:11:08,760
compute f of f inverse of three. And that means we take f of f inverse of three. Since f inverse

2608
05:11:08,760 --> 05:11:18,600
of three is two, that's the same thing as computing f of two, which is three. Please pause the video

2609
05:11:18,600 --> 05:11:28,840
for a moment and compute these other compositions. You should have found that in every case, if you

2610
05:11:28,840 --> 05:11:35,240
take f inverse of f of a number, you get back to the very same number you started with. And similarly,

2611
05:11:35,240 --> 05:11:40,120
if you take f of f inverse of any number, you get back to the same number you started with.

2612
05:11:40,360 --> 05:11:49,560
So in general, f inverse of f of x is equal to x, and f of f inverse of x is also equal to x. This

2613
05:11:49,560 --> 05:11:56,040
is the mathematical way of saying that f and f inverse undo each other. Let's look at a different

2614
05:11:56,040 --> 05:12:02,760
example. Suppose that f of x is x cubed. Pause the video for a moment and guess what the inverse

2615
05:12:02,840 --> 05:12:08,360
of f should be. Remember, f inverse undoes the work that f does.

2616
05:12:11,400 --> 05:12:18,120
You might have guessed that f inverse of x is going to be the cube root function. Now we can

2617
05:12:18,120 --> 05:12:26,440
check that this is true by looking at f of f inverse of x, that's f of the cube root of function,

2618
05:12:26,440 --> 05:12:33,720
which means the cube root function cubed, which gets us back to x. Similarly, if we compute f

2619
05:12:33,720 --> 05:12:42,280
inverse of f of x, that's the cube root of x cubed, and we get back to x again. So the cube

2620
05:12:42,280 --> 05:12:47,640
root function really is the inverse of the cubing function. When we compose the two functions,

2621
05:12:47,640 --> 05:12:55,160
we get back to the number that we started with. It'd be nice to have a more systematic way of

2622
05:12:55,240 --> 05:13:02,840
finding inverses of functions besides guessing and checking. One method uses the fact that inverses

2623
05:13:02,840 --> 05:13:09,080
reverse the roles of y and x. So if we want to find the inverse of the function f of x equals

2624
05:13:09,080 --> 05:13:17,880
five minus x over three x, we can write it as y equals five minus x over three x. Reverse the

2625
05:13:17,880 --> 05:13:28,840
roles of y and x to get x equals five minus y over three y, and then solve for y. To solve for y,

2626
05:13:28,840 --> 05:13:37,080
let's multiply both sides by three y. Bring all terms with y's in them to the left side,

2627
05:13:37,640 --> 05:13:42,760
and all terms without y's in them to the right side. Factor out the y

2628
05:13:43,240 --> 05:13:56,040
and divide to isolate y. This gives us f inverse of x as five over three x plus one.

2629
05:13:57,640 --> 05:14:03,880
Notice that our original function f and our inverse function f inverse are both rational

2630
05:14:03,880 --> 05:14:10,760
functions, but they're not the reciprocals of each other. And in general, f inverse of x is not

2631
05:14:10,760 --> 05:14:19,240
usually equal to one over f of x. This can be confusing, because when we write two to the minus

2632
05:14:19,240 --> 05:14:27,080
one, that does mean one over two. But f to the minus one of x means the inverse function and not

2633
05:14:27,080 --> 05:14:34,840
the reciprocal. It's natural to ask if all functions have inverse functions. That is, for any

2634
05:14:34,840 --> 05:14:42,280
function you might encounter, is there always a function that is its inverse? In fact, the answer

2635
05:14:42,280 --> 05:14:50,120
is no. See if you can come up with an example of a function that does not have an inverse function.

2636
05:14:51,560 --> 05:14:57,720
The word function here is key. Remember that a function is a relationship between x values and

2637
05:14:57,800 --> 05:15:07,320
y values, such that for each x value in the domain, there's only one corresponding y value.

2638
05:15:10,440 --> 05:15:18,040
One example of a function that does not have an inverse function is the function f of x equals x

2639
05:15:18,040 --> 05:15:27,320
squared. To see that the inverse of this function is not a function, note that for the x squared

2640
05:15:27,320 --> 05:15:36,920
function, the number two and the number negative two both go to number four. So if I had an inverse,

2641
05:15:37,800 --> 05:15:44,520
it would have to send four to both two and negative two. The inverse would not be a function.

2642
05:15:45,960 --> 05:15:50,920
It might be easier to understand the problem when you look at a graph of y equals x squared.

2643
05:15:50,920 --> 05:16:01,480
Recall that inverse functions reverse the roles of y and x and flip the graph over the line y equals

2644
05:16:01,480 --> 05:16:09,240
x. But when I flip the green graph over the line y equals x, I get this red graph. This red graph

2645
05:16:09,240 --> 05:16:14,680
is not the graph of a function because it violates the vertical line test. The reason

2646
05:16:14,680 --> 05:16:20,200
that violates the vertical line test is because the original green function violates the horizontal

2647
05:16:20,200 --> 05:16:30,520
line test and has two x values with the same y value. In general, a function f has an inverse

2648
05:16:30,520 --> 05:16:36,600
function if and only if the graph of f satisfies the horizontal line test, i.e. every horizontal line

2649
05:16:36,600 --> 05:16:42,840
intersects the graph in at most one point. Pause the video for a moment and see which of these

2650
05:16:42,840 --> 05:16:49,080
four graphs satisfy the horizontal line test. In other words, which of the four corresponding

2651
05:16:49,080 --> 05:16:56,520
functions would have an inverse function? You may have found that graphs A and B

2652
05:16:57,480 --> 05:17:02,600
violate the horizontal line test. So their functions would not have inverse functions.

2653
05:17:03,320 --> 05:17:10,200
But graphs C and D satisfy the horizontal line test. So these graphs represent functions that

2654
05:17:10,200 --> 05:17:16,920
do have inverses. Functions that satisfy the horizontal line test are sometimes called

2655
05:17:16,920 --> 05:17:25,400
one-to-one functions. Equivalently, a function is one-to-one if for any two different x values,

2656
05:17:26,200 --> 05:17:34,760
x1 and x2, the y values f of x1 and f of x2 are different numbers. Sometimes as I said,

2657
05:17:35,320 --> 05:17:44,680
f is one-to-one if whenever f of x1 is equal to f of x2, then x1 has to equal x2.

2658
05:17:44,920 --> 05:17:52,200
As our last example, let's try to find p inverse of x, where p of x is the square root of x minus

2659
05:17:52,200 --> 05:18:00,200
2 drawn here. If we graph p inverse on the same axis as p of x, we get the following graph,

2660
05:18:01,000 --> 05:18:07,720
simply by flipping over the line y equals x. If we try to solve the problem algebraically,

2661
05:18:08,520 --> 05:18:14,440
we can write y equal to square root of x minus 2, reverse the roles of y and x,

2662
05:18:15,320 --> 05:18:20,200
and solve for y by squaring both sides and adding 2.

2663
05:18:24,040 --> 05:18:30,040
Now if we were to graph y equals x squared plus 2, that would look like a parabola. It would look

2664
05:18:30,040 --> 05:18:37,400
like the red graph we've already drawn together with another arm on the left side.

2665
05:18:37,960 --> 05:18:43,480
But we know that our actual inverse function consists only of this right arm.

2666
05:18:46,520 --> 05:18:54,200
We can specify this algebraically by making the restriction that x has to be bigger than or equal

2667
05:18:54,200 --> 05:19:03,160
to zero. This corresponds to the fact that on the original graph for the square root of x, y was

2668
05:19:03,160 --> 05:19:10,200
only greater than or equal to zero. Looking more closely at the domain and range of p and p inverse,

2669
05:19:10,760 --> 05:19:19,400
we know that the domain of p is all values of x such that x minus 2 is greater than or equal to

2670
05:19:19,400 --> 05:19:25,800
zero, since we can't take the square root of a negative number. This corresponds to x values

2671
05:19:25,800 --> 05:19:31,000
being greater than or equal to 2, or an interval notation, the interval from 2 to infinity.

2672
05:19:31,480 --> 05:19:38,200
The range of p we can see from the graph is all y values greater than or equal to 0, or the interval

2673
05:19:38,200 --> 05:19:48,280
from 0 to infinity. Similarly, based on the graph, we see the domain of p inverse is x values greater

2674
05:19:48,280 --> 05:19:55,880
than or equal to 0, the interval from 0 to infinity, and the range of p inverse is y values greater

2675
05:19:56,680 --> 05:20:03,720
than or equal to 2, or the interval from 2 to infinity. If you look closely at these domains

2676
05:20:03,720 --> 05:20:09,880
and ranges, you'll notice that the domain of p corresponds exactly to the range of p inverse,

2677
05:20:10,440 --> 05:20:18,760
and the range of p corresponds to the domain of p inverse. This makes sense because inverse

2678
05:20:18,760 --> 05:20:27,000
functions reverse the rules of y and x. The domain of f inverse of x is the x values for f inverse,

2679
05:20:27,000 --> 05:20:34,840
which corresponds to the y values, or the range of f. The range of f inverse is the y values for

2680
05:20:34,840 --> 05:20:43,880
f inverse, which correspond to the x values, or the domain of f. In this video, we discussed five

2681
05:20:43,880 --> 05:20:50,440
key properties of inverse functions. Inverse functions reverse the roles of y and x.

2682
05:20:52,600 --> 05:21:00,600
The graph of y equals f inverse of x is the graph of y equals f of x

2683
05:21:01,720 --> 05:21:10,280
reflected over the line y equals x. When we compose f with f inverse, we get the identity

2684
05:21:10,280 --> 05:21:18,600
function y equals x. And similarly, when we compose f inverse with f, that brings x to x.

2685
05:21:18,600 --> 05:21:27,720
In other words, f and f inverse undo each other. The function f of x has an inverse function,

2686
05:21:29,560 --> 05:21:38,600
if and only if the graph of y equals f of x satisfies the horizontal line test.

2687
05:21:40,520 --> 05:21:54,040
And finally, the domain of f is the range of f inverse. And the range of f is the domain of f

2688
05:21:54,040 --> 05:22:01,640
inverse. These properties of inverse functions will be important when we study exponential functions

2689
05:22:01,640 --> 05:22:04,600
and their inverses logarithmic functions.
