 Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (OMP) is a greedy algorithm used for finding sparse solutions to systems of linear equations represented by matrices A and vectors b, where you're looking for a solution vector x such that Ax = b with as few non-zero elements in x as possible. The OMP algorithm proceeds iteratively, adding one atom (column from A) at a time to the solution until the residual (the difference between b and the approximation of b obtained so far) is below a certain threshold or becomes zero.

Here's a concise summary of the OMP algorithm:

1. **Initialization**: Start with \( k = 0 \), \( x_0 = 0 \), and \( S_0 = \emptyset \) (the support of x is initially empty). The initial residual \( r_0 \) is the vector b.

2. **Iteration**: For each \( k \), perform the following steps:
    - Compute the inner product between the current residual \( r_{k-1} \) and each column of A (normalized basis atoms), to find which atom best matches the residual. This step involves multiplying \( A^T \) by \( r_{k-1} \) and taking the absolute value of the resulting vector to identify the maximum correlation.
    - Select the atom corresponding to the largest absolute value as the next atom to add to the solution. Update the support set \( S_k = S_{k-1} \cup \{ j \} \), where \( j \) is the index of the selected atom.
    - Calculate the new residual \( r_k \) by subtracting from b the contribution of the newly added atom (i.e., multiplying the selected atom by the corresponding entry in the current approximation of x).
    - Update \( x_k \) using a least squares approach. This involves solving for x in the overdetermined system defined by the subset of A corresponding to the support \( S_k \). The solution is obtained using the pseudo-inverse of the submatrix ASk, where Asubk is the matrix formed by the columns of A in \( S_k \), and s is the vector of the values of x corresponding to \( S_k \).
    - Check if the norm of \( r_k \) is below a predefined threshold or zero. If so, terminate the algorithm; otherwise, continue with the next iteration.

3. **Termination**: The algorithm terminates when the residual is sufficiently small or has been reduced to zero, and the final solution \( x_k \) is returned.

The OMP algorithm is called "orthogonal" because of the orthogonality property it exploits: after an atom is added to the solution, its inner product with the residual is zero (assuming the atoms are normalized), which means that this atom will not be selected again in subsequent iterations.

The OMP algorithm is efficient in terms of operations required because it avoids full matrix inversion at each step by using recursive updates to the pseudo-inverse, reducing the computational complexity to \( O(k \cdot m \cdot n) \), where \( k \) is the final cardinality of the solution.

In summary, OMP is a greedy algorithm that iteratively selects atoms from A that best match the current residual, updates the solution and the residual, and stops when the residual is below a threshold, ensuring sparsity in the solution vector x. It is particularly useful for large-scale problems where only a few significant features are present in b.
