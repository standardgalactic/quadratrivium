Processing Overview for EmacsConf and Emacs hangouts
============================
Checking EmacsConf and Emacs hangouts/EmacsConf 2020 - 33 - Maxima a computer algebra system in Emacs - Fermin MF.txt
1. Maxima package for Emacs is designed to improve the experience of using Maxima within Emacs, with a focus on making it more interactive and convenient. The creator aims to refine the code further and make it more robust before improving the standard version.

2. Maxima itself has different syntax modes, including strict infix notation, which can be used within Emaca's Maxima mode. However, there are some functionalities in Maxima that Maxima mode for Emacs (Maxima.el) does not yet support, such as embedding images or creating new plots directly within the buffer.

3. The package was first implemented to handle basic functions and is already quite usable, but there are still areas of the code that the creator wants to clean up and improve.

4. Maxima is used extensively in various universities for both engineering and mathematics courses.

5. While it's possible to integrate Maxima code into Emacs files and use them with the Maxima mode, full parity with other language integrations (like Jupyter notebooks) is not yet available due to the package's current basic state.

6. The creator of the Maxima package for Emacs is open to opening the package into a separate repository if needed, but points out that integration testing might be more challenging since Maxima uses continuous integration and delivery methods (like Kid-Lab).

7. The live Q&A session was an opportunity for the community to engage with the creator of the Maxima package for Emacs, ask questions, and provide feedback.

8. Overall, the Maxima package for Emacs is a work in progress aimed at enhancing the user experience for those who use Maxima within Emacs and are looking for more interactive capabilities.
