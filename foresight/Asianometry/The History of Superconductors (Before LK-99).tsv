0	8800	On July 22nd, 2023, a paper was posted claiming the creation of a Room Temperature Ambient
8800	12800	Pressure Superconductor LK-99.
12800	17440	The world is now trying to synthesize the thing and replicate the paper's findings,
17440	21440	the LK-99 Wikipedia page is keeping a running tally.
21440	26080	The quest for a room temperature superconductor has gone on for over a century.
26080	29720	It has seen some amazing highs and lows.
29720	35080	In this video, let us dive into the dream and track the 100-year history of technological
35080	39240	progression towards this mythical substance.
39240	41620	But first, I want to remind you about the newsletter.
41620	46040	Sign up for updates and new analysis, the full scripts of selected popular videos, and
46040	47040	more.
47040	48880	The sign up link is in the video description below.
48880	50720	I try to put one out every week.
50720	51720	Maybe two.
51720	54240	Alright, back to the show.
54240	58080	Resistance is a material's opposition to an electric current flowing through it.
58080	63760	A conductor has low resistance, and so let's electrons easily move through them, insulators
63760	65320	do not.
65320	69360	In previous videos, I have mentioned that all real-world materials have some amount
69360	70640	of resistance.
70640	75600	Of course, I was not thinking about superconductors, perhaps because I didn't consider them practical
75600	77200	materials.
77200	80800	We have known about superconductivity for over a century now.
80800	86760	In 1911, the Dutch physicist and Nobel Prize winner Heike Kamerle Onnes and his students
86760	92560	started performing experiments at super-low temperatures using liquid helium.
92560	97080	At the time, people speculated on what might happen to the electrical resistance of metals
97080	99960	as they approached absolute zero.
99960	105600	Sir James DeWor, inventor of the vacuum flask, theorized that electrical resistance would
105600	108840	infinitesimally approach zero.
108840	112840	Lord Kelvin, on the other hand, thought that it would hit some minimum before quickly rising
112840	117680	towards infinity, his reasoning being that the electrons would stop moving as it gets
117680	119280	colder.
119280	122760	So Kamerle Onnes did an experiment with mercury.
122760	123760	Why mercury?
123760	127680	Because it was the only metal they had available in sufficient purity.
127680	134880	And unexpectedly, the experiment showed mercury's resistance falling to zero just below 4.2 Kelvin.
134880	140640	Kamerle Onnes named the state superconductivity, the temperature at which the material achieves
140640	144640	this state is called the transition temperature.
144640	147960	The first superconductors triggered a great deal of excitement.
147960	153400	It was the electrical engineer's wet dream, a future free of electrical resistance.
153400	159960	In 1913, Kamerle Onnes traveled to Chicago and spoke of building a helium cooling plant
159960	166640	in pursuit of smaller, more efficient motors or generators using superconductivity.
166640	169320	Optimistic Kamerle Onnes continued his work.
169320	175760	He discovered that lead's transition temperature was 7.2 Kelvin, slightly higher than mercury.
175760	181600	In 1914, he then made a coil of lead wire, froze it to 7.2 Kelvin, and passed an electrical
181600	183120	current through it.
183120	188260	But to his disappointment, the coil lost all of its superconducting powers when the magnetic
188260	192760	field got to be about as strong as a horseshoe magnet.
192760	197400	As it turns out, superconductivity requires not only a low enough temperature, but also
197400	202520	a low enough magnetic field and a low enough amount of current passing through it, current
202520	203800	density.
203800	209600	The material can only maintain their superconductivity if all three sit within the parameters.
209600	215240	Today, pure metal or simple alloy superconductors are known for this fundamental weakness.
215240	217940	These are not good for practical industrial use.
217940	223040	After all, electrical systems encounter magnetic fields all the time.
223040	225480	Kamerle Onnes must have been crushed.
225480	230120	He was one of the first scientists to have fallen victim to the sirens of superconductivity.
230120	233680	He would not be the last.
233680	237000	Research on superconductor materials then slowed for a decade.
237000	241840	The need for liquid helium cooling stood as a formidable financial barrier to continued
241840	243480	commercialization.
243480	246960	And there was no big market need pushing for it either.
246960	251360	Many people worked on the concept simply because it fascinated them.
251360	254760	Through them, pioneering science was done in the 1930s.
254760	262520	We discovered three more superconductors, tantalum at 4.4K, thorium at 1.4K, and neobium,
262520	268120	which has the highest transition temperature yet known at 9.2 Kelvin.
268120	271160	In 1933, we discovered the Meisner effect.
271160	276720	This is where a superconductor expels all magnetic fields as it transitions into a superconducting
276720	277720	state.
277720	282120	In other words, the magnetic field will go around the superconductor material rather
282120	283920	than permeate through it.
283920	289360	This explains why all the videos you see of these things are of them floating on magnets.
289360	293040	And then a second major discovery that went under the radar.
293040	299360	In the late 1920s, the Soviet Ukrainian scientist Lev Shubnikov worked at a cryogenic lab in
299360	300560	the Netherlands.
300560	305000	In 1930, he returned to the Soviet Union and continued his research.
305000	310240	There, his experiments discovered what are now called type 2 superconductors.
310240	314760	These are quite different from the pure metal superconductors today called type 1.
314760	318240	That's so disappointed Kamerle Ones.
318240	323920	Type 1 superconductors fall back to normal behavior when they breach their magnetic limit.
323920	329040	But type 2 superconductors can display a mix of ordinary and superconducting properties
329040	331800	at certain magnetic limits.
331800	337120	So type 2s can potentially be made to be far more tolerant of higher magnetic fields than
337120	338480	type 1s.
338480	342360	These are almost always complicated alloys or compounds.
342360	346680	Sadly, Shubnikov never got to see the benefits of his work.
346680	352720	At the height of the Great Purge in 1937, the NKVD targeted him for his foreign connections.
352720	356280	They arrested him, accused him of espionage, and shot him.
356280	360400	It would be many years before the rest of the superconductor community recognized and
360400	365560	capitalized on the significance of his work.
365560	370120	World War II had shown the entire world the economic and military value of turning sciences
370120	372120	into technologies.
372120	377320	Shortly before the war, MIT professor Samuel Collins invented the Collins Helium Liquifier
377320	378520	System.
378520	384000	Widely introduced after the war, the Collins made liquid helium more available for superconductor
384000	385640	research.
385640	390800	Yet the search for higher temperature superconductors, perhaps even a room temperature one, remained
390800	392120	quite difficult.
392120	395120	We did not have good theory to tell us where to look.
395120	400280	So most people started with metals with already low amounts of resistivity, copper, gold,
400280	402960	silver, so on.
402960	408280	In the early 1950s, a pair of scientists, B. T. Matthias and John Holm, took a different
408280	409280	approach.
409280	413600	They embarked on a systematic search via experimentation.
413600	419520	The two pioneered the method of finding superconductors via the Meisner effect, the superconductor's
419520	422520	tendency to expel magnetic fields.
422520	427640	They applied an extra magnetic field to a sample as it was being cooled and measured
427640	430800	whether it expelled that magnetic field.
430800	435800	Matthias and Holm systematically moved through the periodic table, eventually testing over
435800	438440	5,000 compounds.
438440	442480	This was how they discovered the A3B superconductors.
442480	447800	Three niobium atoms and one atom of either silicon, tin, or aluminum.
447800	450640	Yes, it's a terrible name.
450760	457520	Anyway, these would hold the record for the highest transition temperature, 23K, for 28
457520	458520	years.
458520	464080	Matthias eventually formulated the Matthias rules for finding a superconductor, which,
464080	469640	kind of like the pirate code, are more what you'd call guidelines than actual rules.
469640	474080	Rule number 6 was, stay away from theorists.
474080	478440	As you might expect, Matthias looked down on superconducting theory, calling them just
478440	479960	descriptions.
479960	485040	But the physics world wanted a theory to help guide their way forward, and in 1957,
485040	489360	three scientists proposed a theory that did just that.
489360	494560	John Robert Schreifer, Leon Cooper, one of the namesakes of Sheldon Cooper, and John
494560	496080	Bardeen.
496080	497920	Recognize the name of that last guy?
497920	503720	Bardeen won his first Nobel Prize in physics as one of the three inventors of the transistor.
503720	506600	This theory won him his second.
506600	511080	The theory was named BCS, named after its three inventors.
511080	515040	BCS also stands for Bowl Championship Series.
515040	521000	It was a system that helped select the matchups in top tier American football college divisions.
521000	524720	Cal hasn't won a football championship since before World War II, so I don't know why I
524720	526160	care to mention this.
526160	527840	Let's move on.
527840	534000	Anyway, BCS theory suggests that when a material enters a superconducting state, their electrons
534000	535280	pair up.
535280	538520	This is weird because normally they repel each other.
538520	544040	But in that superconducting state, we have the influence of a new force called phonons.
544040	549200	Phonons are measurable, energized vibrations in the material's crystal lattice.
549200	554960	Thanks to attractive forces from these phonons, the electron pairs create a brand new form
554960	557480	called Cooper pairs.
557480	562840	Cooper pairs are exempt from the Pauli exclusion principle, which explains why two solid objects
562840	568600	can't be in the same place at the same time, and also why all matter does not simply collapse
568600	573040	into a single point despite everything being mostly empty space.
573040	576600	I think I asked my mom that once when I was a kid.
576600	582400	Thusly, Cooper pairs allow these electrons to act differently than they usually do, traveling
582400	585360	through the crystal lattice without resistance.
585360	589120	This part of the theory has generally held up over the years.
589120	593240	Cooper pairs are key to superconductivity.
593240	598080	The energy bond holding these Cooper pairs are quite weak, so they can be easily shaken
598080	599840	apart by thermal energy.
599840	607400	Thus, BCS theory does a good job of explaining superconductivity at low temperatures.
607400	612960	Superconducting materials whose behavior is explainable by BCS theory are known as conventional
612960	615320	superconductors.
615320	621800	By 1960, we knew about 35 elements and 1,000 different alloys to have shown superconductivity
621800	624440	under certain conditions.
624440	630960	In 1961, scientists discovered a series of niobium-based alloys that retained their superconductivity
630960	634440	in the presence of a stronger magnetic field.
634440	639800	These were called high-field superconductors, and they theoretically allowed us to make large
639800	645480	superconducting wires that perform far better than traditional copper ones.
645480	651600	Such wires can produce very powerful magnetic fields using very little power.
651600	656760	High-field superconductors achieved the original dream of Camerling Ones many decades ago,
656760	663680	but even so, it took the industry until early 1970 to reliably and viably produce superconducting
663680	665240	wire.
665240	671440	Such superconducting wires eventually became the widely accepted method for producing MRIs.
671440	676880	MRIs with superconducting wire remained the single biggest and most important commercial
676880	681800	use for superconductor materials.
681800	687320	In 1986, two researchers at an IBM lab in Zurich, Switzerland, were collaborating on
687320	690240	a study on superconductors.
690240	695720	Alex Muller was a senior research fellow at IBM who received the job basically as a
695720	697960	stopover before retirement.
697960	702440	He had gotten interested in the field after spending 20 months in New York.
702440	708120	There, he observed IBM's massive Josephson Computer Technology project.
708120	713480	That was a $300 million effort to build an ultra-fast computer based on superconducting
713480	715320	digital logic switches.
715320	717720	It ultimately failed.
717720	722400	I will talk about Josephson and his learnings in a future video about superconducting circuits
722400	724600	and their computers.
724600	730560	Upon returning to Zurich in 1983, Muller recruited a colleague, Georg Bednorz, to look
730560	733520	for superconductors in oxides.
733520	737680	After a couple frustrating years searching around, they came across an article from a
737680	744440	team of French scientists describing metal-like electrical conductivity at a rather high temperature,
744440	747480	like 900 degrees Celsius high.
747480	749040	That was interesting.
749040	753200	Ceramics are traditionally known to be electrical insulators.
753200	758280	After further experiments, the duo produced a ceramic compound of barium, lanthanum, copper,
758280	765080	and oxygen that achieved superconductivity at 35 Kelvin, a legit breakthrough.
765080	770320	As is so often in the land of superconductors, this discovery came as a total surprise.
770320	774680	Bednorz and Muller first kept their results away from even their colleagues and their
774680	776320	employer.
776320	781280	They decided to first publish their results at a small but reputable German physics journal,
781280	784720	apparently because they personally knew its editor.
784720	791200	In April 1986, they submitted the paper, which was deliberately given a very disarming title,
791200	797420	possible high TC superconductivity in the BALACUO system.
797420	801320	They chose this title because the two were not sure about their result.
801320	805640	For instance, the Meisner effect had not yet been measured in it.
805640	811240	After some time, the paper was finally published in September 1986, but rumors had been circulating
811240	816480	since July and they shook the scientific community like an earthquake.
816480	822720	Not only because ceramics, like I said before, were not seen to be good conductors, but also
822720	828120	Bednorz and Muller were seen as outsiders to the superconductor community working in
828120	831320	a backwater of the IBM research machine.
831320	836000	One prominent member of the community, jaded by false claims over the years, was tempted
836000	840560	to simply throw the paper away when he first saw it.
840560	845680	These new ceramics also violated the previously established rules of superconductors.
845680	853040	It did not follow the Matthias rules and not only that, it highlighted a hole in BCS theory.
853040	860000	By then, physicists had largely adopted BCS as a reasonably rigorous explanation of superconductivity
860000	865360	and because BCS only worked in low temperatures, superconductivity in general was regarded
865360	869040	as an exclusively low-temperature phenomenon.
869040	874440	This discovery heralded a new class of ceramic oxide superconductors with high transition
874440	880480	temperatures higher than ever before seen, referred to as high-temperature superconductors
880480	882880	or high-T.
882880	886160	Research teams around the world raced to replicate the results.
886160	892920	In late November 1986, some two months after publication, the Asahi Shinbon newspaper reported
892920	899360	that a team led by Shoji Tanaka of the University of Tokyo had successfully repeated the experiment
899360	901680	confirming the results.
901680	907000	A few weeks after that, Paul Chu of the University of Houston replicated the results.
907000	909840	Chu's results made the headlines.
909840	914080	More impressively, he believed that there were other materials out there with even higher
914320	916320	transition temperatures.
916320	922560	A race for new superconductors soon emerged with the big line being 77K, the temperature
922560	924720	of liquid nitrogen.
924720	930840	Various groups in Beijing, Tokyo and the US traded papers back and forth.
930840	936200	Then in January 1987, Dr. Chu discovered a superconductor with a transition temperature
936200	941640	above 90K, breaking the so-called liquid nitrogen barrier.
941640	946920	Chu held off publishing for as long as possible as he first tried to patent the material.
946920	952880	Finally, in February 1987, he announced his marvelous technical breakthrough.
952880	958520	This class of high-temperature superconductors is sometimes called one-two-three superconductors
958520	964320	because they have one atom of yttrium, two atoms of barium, and three atoms of copper.
964320	969280	There is also some oxygen attached, but whatever it messes with the cool naming.
969280	975160	These things are also more generally referred to as YBCO superconductors, cuprate superconductors,
975160	977760	or rare earth cuprate superconductors.
977760	981120	Oh hey, more rare earth stuff.
981120	983880	Wonder who's the world leader in those?
983880	988440	Anyway, all cuprate superconductors share the same structure.
988440	992000	They are big layered compounds, kind of like cakes.
992000	997800	Layers of copper oxygen separated from one another by insulating oxide layers.
997800	1002240	The superconductivity happens within those thin copper oxygen layers.
1002240	1004720	We aren't exactly sure how it works.
1004720	1010720	Cooper pairs are probably involved, but differently from how it is in BCS theory, making them
1010720	1014440	unconventional superconductors.
1014440	1018280	Cuprates broke the nitrogen barrier, which meant that we can use liquid nitrogen to cool
1018280	1022320	them rather than liquid helium, which is what we used before.
1022320	1024760	This has significant cost benefits.
1024920	1035800	On March 15th, the American Physical Society held a special symposium on high-temperature
1035800	1039800	superconductors specifically to talk about the results.
1039800	1044840	Several thousand physicists gathered at the Hilton at what they now call the Woodstock
1044840	1046560	of Physics.
1046560	1051480	The highlight was a special evening session dedicated to the discovery held on Wednesday
1051480	1053600	night in the Hilton Grand Ballroom.
1053600	1055760	It was filled to the brink.
1055760	1063360	The session started out at 7pm and ended at around 3am, a magical eight hours long.
1063360	1068200	A gold rush was on for new materials based on this breakthrough.
1068200	1072000	Superconductor-related headlines hit the media like the New York Times.
1072000	1078120	Businessweek cried out, superconductors, more important than the light bulb and the transistor.
1078120	1080120	The fever swept over Japan.
1080120	1085240	Multiple ministries rapidly directed R&D spending into this new category.
1085240	1092120	By 1988, Mindy's single biggest R&D expenditure was on high-temperature superconductors.
1092120	1099480	The US, too, the White House even held a presidential conference on superconductivity in July 1987.
1099480	1105120	Reagan proposed an 11-point plan to build new industries around this new technology.
1105120	1110880	Tens of millions of dollars of federal R&D were funneled into superconductors.
1110880	1114860	On the corporate front, IBM and Bell Labs faced off with one another.
1114860	1119080	They joined the fray alongside a bunch of new startups with buzzy names like American
1119080	1125520	Superconductor Corporation, Conductus, Illinois Superconductor Incorporated, and Superconducting
1125520	1128280	Technologies Incorporated.
1128280	1131280	The discoveries kept coming throughout 1987.
1131280	1136560	By playing around with the original barium, lanthanum, copper, and oxygen ceramic formula,
1136560	1142080	researchers were able to find corporate superconductors with increasingly higher transition temperatures.
1142080	1146720	But the gaps between science and technology can be quite large and take a long time to
1146720	1147720	overcome.
1147720	1152480	As it turns out, transition temperature was only one of the factors that engineers have
1152480	1156200	to consider when building commercially viable systems.
1156200	1159880	For instance, take superconducting wires for MRI machines.
1159880	1164640	The original promise of high-temperature superconductors was that we can swap out more expensive liquid
1164640	1168320	helium cooling systems for cheaper liquid nitrogen ones.
1168320	1170120	Should be easy, right?
1170120	1174200	But as Cameron Ling-Ona has found out long before, superconducting wires need to also
1174200	1178960	be able to carry high current densities and withstand very high magnetic fields.
1178960	1182200	In other words, they need to meet their critical parameters.
1182200	1187400	The corporate high-temperature superconductors do indeed have much higher transition temperatures,
1187400	1191720	but their other critical parameters are not as dramatically higher.
1191720	1195640	There was also a substantial materials engineering problem.
1195640	1201040	Corporate superconductors are ceramics, complicated materials that are very brittle to work with.
1201040	1204760	This by itself limited their usefulness as a material.
1204760	1206520	They also work differently.
1206520	1210880	If you recall, the cuprits are layered cakes, and all the superconducting happens within
1210880	1214840	those single flat layers of copper and oxygen.
1214840	1219160	This imposes big challenges on how we might achieve this superconductivity.
1219160	1224040	If we want to produce a wire using this material, it needs to be done in a specific way in order
1224040	1228520	to maintain good alignment over potentially hundreds of meters.
1228520	1233000	So it took a substantial amount of time to eventually engineer wire using high-temperature
1233000	1234000	superconductors.
1234000	1239160	They do exist, and are used for things like cables for power usage, but that took years
1239160	1241200	to develop.
1241200	1245520	Even if there are certain applications where the high-tea cuprits superconductors still
1245520	1248560	fall short of established technologies.
1248560	1254240	Neobium titanium established all the way back in 1970 continues to dominate superconducting
1254240	1260720	wires for MRI machines, mostly due to their superior mechanical properties.
1260720	1265520	The slow speed of commercialization dampened enthusiasm and unfortunately high-temperature
1265520	1271320	superconductors could not uncover that golden killer app that would stimulate more investment
1271320	1272920	into the space.
1272920	1277120	Over time, the height receded as it became clear that the cuprits did not present a
1277120	1281680	way towards room-temperature superconductivity.
1281680	1285600	The scientific community did not forget Bednor's and Muller, though.
1285600	1290520	Just 16 months after their discovery, the tube won the Nobel Prize in Physics, the record
1290520	1295480	for the fastest recognition in Nobel physics history.
1295480	1299640	Superconductor research continued for another high-temperature alternative to the cuprits
1299640	1300640	superconductors.
1300640	1308560	In 2001, a Japanese team discovered an interesting non-cuprits superconductor magnesium diboride.
1308560	1314040	Its transition temperature was 39 Kelvin, far below the cuprits, but at least much higher
1314040	1317080	than the traditional low-temperature superconductors.
1317080	1323160	Unfortunately, its behavior was conventional BCS, so a dead end.
1323160	1328720	The next significant high-temperature discovery came in February 2008, when Dr. Hideo Hosono
1328720	1335520	reported a fluorine-doped iron-based superconductor with a transition temperature of 26 Kelvin.
1335520	1340640	This opened up a new branch of high-temperature superconductors separate from the cuprits.
1340640	1342640	At the outset, there was a lot of hope.
1342640	1348040	A few months another iron superconductor was found with a transition temperature of 56
1348040	1352080	Kelvin, but progress there has since stalled.
1352080	1357760	And then, recently in 2015, a team in Germany published a paper claiming superconductivity
1357760	1362560	in sulfur hydrides at over 200 Kelvin and high pressure.
1362560	1367520	Interesting but again nothing that has real-world industrial implications.
1367520	1373520	And there have been some questions about superconductivity in these sulfide hydrides.
1373520	1379960	One recent controversial room temperature claim was recently retracted by Nature Magazine.
1379960	1385080	The search continues for a room-temperature superconductor, or even a relatively high-temperature
1385080	1390480	superconductor with fewer engineering compromises than what we already have.
1390480	1392740	Is LK99 really it?
1392740	1396320	I don't know, but will it really change everything if it was?
1396320	1398480	Is it really the next transistor?
1398480	1401160	It is hard for me to believe that.
1401160	1405920	When we dream of room-temperature superconductors, we talk about things like levitating trains,
1405920	1410000	compact MRIs, economical fusion energy, and the like.
1410000	1414000	Well, they have been citing these things since 1986.
1414000	1419680	Many applications are already technically possible with existing low-temperature superconductors.
1419680	1424920	But there are real economic reasons why we don't have those today.
1424920	1427620	For instance, magnets for maglev trains.
1427620	1431400	The magnets are not a significant portion of the financial costs for these machines.
1431800	1437360	It is tied to the cost of the land, the labor, the extensive planning, and the construction.
1437360	1440880	And then there is always the chance that a room-temperature superconductor, whether
1440880	1446160	LK99 is it or not, cannot compete with existing economic solutions.
1446160	1447920	Look again at the MRI.
1447920	1452680	Intuitively, you might think that this new generation of high-temperature cuprits would
1452680	1458800	sweep out the old superconducting wire tech used for those MRIs like yesterday's trash.
1458800	1461360	But it turned out to be far more subtle than that.
1461360	1467720	Even today, 30 years later, 80-90% of today's MRI machines are still made with good old
1467720	1470000	niobium titanium.
1470000	1472920	Just working these things into wires might take years.
1472920	1474960	Remember these things are layered cakes.
1474960	1477800	Imagine making a cake hundreds of miles long.
1477800	1481960	Real-world applications might be years and millions of dollars away.
1481960	1483640	But hey, I hope I'm wrong.
1483640	1486240	I love the excitement around LK99.
1486240	1490760	No matter the outcome, the fascinating science of superconductivity is having another one
1490760	1492600	of its unique moments.
1492600	1495360	This only happens ever so often in the world.
1495360	1496360	Let's enjoy it.
1496360	1497600	Alright everyone, that's it for tonight.
