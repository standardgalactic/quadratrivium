00:00.000 --> 00:08.800
On July 22nd, 2023, a paper was posted claiming the creation of a Room Temperature Ambient

00:08.800 --> 00:12.800
Pressure Superconductor LK-99.

00:12.800 --> 00:17.440
The world is now trying to synthesize the thing and replicate the paper's findings,

00:17.440 --> 00:21.440
the LK-99 Wikipedia page is keeping a running tally.

00:21.440 --> 00:26.080
The quest for a room temperature superconductor has gone on for over a century.

00:26.080 --> 00:29.720
It has seen some amazing highs and lows.

00:29.720 --> 00:35.080
In this video, let us dive into the dream and track the 100-year history of technological

00:35.080 --> 00:39.240
progression towards this mythical substance.

00:39.240 --> 00:41.620
But first, I want to remind you about the newsletter.

00:41.620 --> 00:46.040
Sign up for updates and new analysis, the full scripts of selected popular videos, and

00:46.040 --> 00:47.040
more.

00:47.040 --> 00:48.880
The sign up link is in the video description below.

00:48.880 --> 00:50.720
I try to put one out every week.

00:50.720 --> 00:51.720
Maybe two.

00:51.720 --> 00:54.240
Alright, back to the show.

00:54.240 --> 00:58.080
Resistance is a material's opposition to an electric current flowing through it.

00:58.080 --> 01:03.760
A conductor has low resistance, and so let's electrons easily move through them, insulators

01:03.760 --> 01:05.320
do not.

01:05.320 --> 01:09.360
In previous videos, I have mentioned that all real-world materials have some amount

01:09.360 --> 01:10.640
of resistance.

01:10.640 --> 01:15.600
Of course, I was not thinking about superconductors, perhaps because I didn't consider them practical

01:15.600 --> 01:17.200
materials.

01:17.200 --> 01:20.800
We have known about superconductivity for over a century now.

01:20.800 --> 01:26.760
In 1911, the Dutch physicist and Nobel Prize winner Heike Kamerle Onnes and his students

01:26.760 --> 01:32.560
started performing experiments at super-low temperatures using liquid helium.

01:32.560 --> 01:37.080
At the time, people speculated on what might happen to the electrical resistance of metals

01:37.080 --> 01:39.960
as they approached absolute zero.

01:39.960 --> 01:45.600
Sir James DeWor, inventor of the vacuum flask, theorized that electrical resistance would

01:45.600 --> 01:48.840
infinitesimally approach zero.

01:48.840 --> 01:52.840
Lord Kelvin, on the other hand, thought that it would hit some minimum before quickly rising

01:52.840 --> 01:57.680
towards infinity, his reasoning being that the electrons would stop moving as it gets

01:57.680 --> 01:59.280
colder.

01:59.280 --> 02:02.760
So Kamerle Onnes did an experiment with mercury.

02:02.760 --> 02:03.760
Why mercury?

02:03.760 --> 02:07.680
Because it was the only metal they had available in sufficient purity.

02:07.680 --> 02:14.880
And unexpectedly, the experiment showed mercury's resistance falling to zero just below 4.2 Kelvin.

02:14.880 --> 02:20.640
Kamerle Onnes named the state superconductivity, the temperature at which the material achieves

02:20.640 --> 02:24.640
this state is called the transition temperature.

02:24.640 --> 02:27.960
The first superconductors triggered a great deal of excitement.

02:27.960 --> 02:33.400
It was the electrical engineer's wet dream, a future free of electrical resistance.

02:33.400 --> 02:39.960
In 1913, Kamerle Onnes traveled to Chicago and spoke of building a helium cooling plant

02:39.960 --> 02:46.640
in pursuit of smaller, more efficient motors or generators using superconductivity.

02:46.640 --> 02:49.320
Optimistic Kamerle Onnes continued his work.

02:49.320 --> 02:55.760
He discovered that lead's transition temperature was 7.2 Kelvin, slightly higher than mercury.

02:55.760 --> 03:01.600
In 1914, he then made a coil of lead wire, froze it to 7.2 Kelvin, and passed an electrical

03:01.600 --> 03:03.120
current through it.

03:03.120 --> 03:08.260
But to his disappointment, the coil lost all of its superconducting powers when the magnetic

03:08.260 --> 03:12.760
field got to be about as strong as a horseshoe magnet.

03:12.760 --> 03:17.400
As it turns out, superconductivity requires not only a low enough temperature, but also

03:17.400 --> 03:22.520
a low enough magnetic field and a low enough amount of current passing through it, current

03:22.520 --> 03:23.800
density.

03:23.800 --> 03:29.600
The material can only maintain their superconductivity if all three sit within the parameters.

03:29.600 --> 03:35.240
Today, pure metal or simple alloy superconductors are known for this fundamental weakness.

03:35.240 --> 03:37.940
These are not good for practical industrial use.

03:37.940 --> 03:43.040
After all, electrical systems encounter magnetic fields all the time.

03:43.040 --> 03:45.480
Kamerle Onnes must have been crushed.

03:45.480 --> 03:50.120
He was one of the first scientists to have fallen victim to the sirens of superconductivity.

03:50.120 --> 03:53.680
He would not be the last.

03:53.680 --> 03:57.000
Research on superconductor materials then slowed for a decade.

03:57.000 --> 04:01.840
The need for liquid helium cooling stood as a formidable financial barrier to continued

04:01.840 --> 04:03.480
commercialization.

04:03.480 --> 04:06.960
And there was no big market need pushing for it either.

04:06.960 --> 04:11.360
Many people worked on the concept simply because it fascinated them.

04:11.360 --> 04:14.760
Through them, pioneering science was done in the 1930s.

04:14.760 --> 04:22.520
We discovered three more superconductors, tantalum at 4.4K, thorium at 1.4K, and neobium,

04:22.520 --> 04:28.120
which has the highest transition temperature yet known at 9.2 Kelvin.

04:28.120 --> 04:31.160
In 1933, we discovered the Meisner effect.

04:31.160 --> 04:36.720
This is where a superconductor expels all magnetic fields as it transitions into a superconducting

04:36.720 --> 04:37.720
state.

04:37.720 --> 04:42.120
In other words, the magnetic field will go around the superconductor material rather

04:42.120 --> 04:43.920
than permeate through it.

04:43.920 --> 04:49.360
This explains why all the videos you see of these things are of them floating on magnets.

04:49.360 --> 04:53.040
And then a second major discovery that went under the radar.

04:53.040 --> 04:59.360
In the late 1920s, the Soviet Ukrainian scientist Lev Shubnikov worked at a cryogenic lab in

04:59.360 --> 05:00.560
the Netherlands.

05:00.560 --> 05:05.000
In 1930, he returned to the Soviet Union and continued his research.

05:05.000 --> 05:10.240
There, his experiments discovered what are now called type 2 superconductors.

05:10.240 --> 05:14.760
These are quite different from the pure metal superconductors today called type 1.

05:14.760 --> 05:18.240
That's so disappointed Kamerle Ones.

05:18.240 --> 05:23.920
Type 1 superconductors fall back to normal behavior when they breach their magnetic limit.

05:23.920 --> 05:29.040
But type 2 superconductors can display a mix of ordinary and superconducting properties

05:29.040 --> 05:31.800
at certain magnetic limits.

05:31.800 --> 05:37.120
So type 2s can potentially be made to be far more tolerant of higher magnetic fields than

05:37.120 --> 05:38.480
type 1s.

05:38.480 --> 05:42.360
These are almost always complicated alloys or compounds.

05:42.360 --> 05:46.680
Sadly, Shubnikov never got to see the benefits of his work.

05:46.680 --> 05:52.720
At the height of the Great Purge in 1937, the NKVD targeted him for his foreign connections.

05:52.720 --> 05:56.280
They arrested him, accused him of espionage, and shot him.

05:56.280 --> 06:00.400
It would be many years before the rest of the superconductor community recognized and

06:00.400 --> 06:05.560
capitalized on the significance of his work.

06:05.560 --> 06:10.120
World War II had shown the entire world the economic and military value of turning sciences

06:10.120 --> 06:12.120
into technologies.

06:12.120 --> 06:17.320
Shortly before the war, MIT professor Samuel Collins invented the Collins Helium Liquifier

06:17.320 --> 06:18.520
System.

06:18.520 --> 06:24.000
Widely introduced after the war, the Collins made liquid helium more available for superconductor

06:24.000 --> 06:25.640
research.

06:25.640 --> 06:30.800
Yet the search for higher temperature superconductors, perhaps even a room temperature one, remained

06:30.800 --> 06:32.120
quite difficult.

06:32.120 --> 06:35.120
We did not have good theory to tell us where to look.

06:35.120 --> 06:40.280
So most people started with metals with already low amounts of resistivity, copper, gold,

06:40.280 --> 06:42.960
silver, so on.

06:42.960 --> 06:48.280
In the early 1950s, a pair of scientists, B. T. Matthias and John Holm, took a different

06:48.280 --> 06:49.280
approach.

06:49.280 --> 06:53.600
They embarked on a systematic search via experimentation.

06:53.600 --> 06:59.520
The two pioneered the method of finding superconductors via the Meisner effect, the superconductor's

06:59.520 --> 07:02.520
tendency to expel magnetic fields.

07:02.520 --> 07:07.640
They applied an extra magnetic field to a sample as it was being cooled and measured

07:07.640 --> 07:10.800
whether it expelled that magnetic field.

07:10.800 --> 07:15.800
Matthias and Holm systematically moved through the periodic table, eventually testing over

07:15.800 --> 07:18.440
5,000 compounds.

07:18.440 --> 07:22.480
This was how they discovered the A3B superconductors.

07:22.480 --> 07:27.800
Three niobium atoms and one atom of either silicon, tin, or aluminum.

07:27.800 --> 07:30.640
Yes, it's a terrible name.

07:30.760 --> 07:37.520
Anyway, these would hold the record for the highest transition temperature, 23K, for 28

07:37.520 --> 07:38.520
years.

07:38.520 --> 07:44.080
Matthias eventually formulated the Matthias rules for finding a superconductor, which,

07:44.080 --> 07:49.640
kind of like the pirate code, are more what you'd call guidelines than actual rules.

07:49.640 --> 07:54.080
Rule number 6 was, stay away from theorists.

07:54.080 --> 07:58.440
As you might expect, Matthias looked down on superconducting theory, calling them just

07:58.440 --> 07:59.960
descriptions.

07:59.960 --> 08:05.040
But the physics world wanted a theory to help guide their way forward, and in 1957,

08:05.040 --> 08:09.360
three scientists proposed a theory that did just that.

08:09.360 --> 08:14.560
John Robert Schreifer, Leon Cooper, one of the namesakes of Sheldon Cooper, and John

08:14.560 --> 08:16.080
Bardeen.

08:16.080 --> 08:17.920
Recognize the name of that last guy?

08:17.920 --> 08:23.720
Bardeen won his first Nobel Prize in physics as one of the three inventors of the transistor.

08:23.720 --> 08:26.600
This theory won him his second.

08:26.600 --> 08:31.080
The theory was named BCS, named after its three inventors.

08:31.080 --> 08:35.040
BCS also stands for Bowl Championship Series.

08:35.040 --> 08:41.000
It was a system that helped select the matchups in top tier American football college divisions.

08:41.000 --> 08:44.720
Cal hasn't won a football championship since before World War II, so I don't know why I

08:44.720 --> 08:46.160
care to mention this.

08:46.160 --> 08:47.840
Let's move on.

08:47.840 --> 08:54.000
Anyway, BCS theory suggests that when a material enters a superconducting state, their electrons

08:54.000 --> 08:55.280
pair up.

08:55.280 --> 08:58.520
This is weird because normally they repel each other.

08:58.520 --> 09:04.040
But in that superconducting state, we have the influence of a new force called phonons.

09:04.040 --> 09:09.200
Phonons are measurable, energized vibrations in the material's crystal lattice.

09:09.200 --> 09:14.960
Thanks to attractive forces from these phonons, the electron pairs create a brand new form

09:14.960 --> 09:17.480
called Cooper pairs.

09:17.480 --> 09:22.840
Cooper pairs are exempt from the Pauli exclusion principle, which explains why two solid objects

09:22.840 --> 09:28.600
can't be in the same place at the same time, and also why all matter does not simply collapse

09:28.600 --> 09:33.040
into a single point despite everything being mostly empty space.

09:33.040 --> 09:36.600
I think I asked my mom that once when I was a kid.

09:36.600 --> 09:42.400
Thusly, Cooper pairs allow these electrons to act differently than they usually do, traveling

09:42.400 --> 09:45.360
through the crystal lattice without resistance.

09:45.360 --> 09:49.120
This part of the theory has generally held up over the years.

09:49.120 --> 09:53.240
Cooper pairs are key to superconductivity.

09:53.240 --> 09:58.080
The energy bond holding these Cooper pairs are quite weak, so they can be easily shaken

09:58.080 --> 09:59.840
apart by thermal energy.

09:59.840 --> 10:07.400
Thus, BCS theory does a good job of explaining superconductivity at low temperatures.

10:07.400 --> 10:12.960
Superconducting materials whose behavior is explainable by BCS theory are known as conventional

10:12.960 --> 10:15.320
superconductors.

10:15.320 --> 10:21.800
By 1960, we knew about 35 elements and 1,000 different alloys to have shown superconductivity

10:21.800 --> 10:24.440
under certain conditions.

10:24.440 --> 10:30.960
In 1961, scientists discovered a series of niobium-based alloys that retained their superconductivity

10:30.960 --> 10:34.440
in the presence of a stronger magnetic field.

10:34.440 --> 10:39.800
These were called high-field superconductors, and they theoretically allowed us to make large

10:39.800 --> 10:45.480
superconducting wires that perform far better than traditional copper ones.

10:45.480 --> 10:51.600
Such wires can produce very powerful magnetic fields using very little power.

10:51.600 --> 10:56.760
High-field superconductors achieved the original dream of Camerling Ones many decades ago,

10:56.760 --> 11:03.680
but even so, it took the industry until early 1970 to reliably and viably produce superconducting

11:03.680 --> 11:05.240
wire.

11:05.240 --> 11:11.440
Such superconducting wires eventually became the widely accepted method for producing MRIs.

11:11.440 --> 11:16.880
MRIs with superconducting wire remained the single biggest and most important commercial

11:16.880 --> 11:21.800
use for superconductor materials.

11:21.800 --> 11:27.320
In 1986, two researchers at an IBM lab in Zurich, Switzerland, were collaborating on

11:27.320 --> 11:30.240
a study on superconductors.

11:30.240 --> 11:35.720
Alex Muller was a senior research fellow at IBM who received the job basically as a

11:35.720 --> 11:37.960
stopover before retirement.

11:37.960 --> 11:42.440
He had gotten interested in the field after spending 20 months in New York.

11:42.440 --> 11:48.120
There, he observed IBM's massive Josephson Computer Technology project.

11:48.120 --> 11:53.480
That was a $300 million effort to build an ultra-fast computer based on superconducting

11:53.480 --> 11:55.320
digital logic switches.

11:55.320 --> 11:57.720
It ultimately failed.

11:57.720 --> 12:02.400
I will talk about Josephson and his learnings in a future video about superconducting circuits

12:02.400 --> 12:04.600
and their computers.

12:04.600 --> 12:10.560
Upon returning to Zurich in 1983, Muller recruited a colleague, Georg Bednorz, to look

12:10.560 --> 12:13.520
for superconductors in oxides.

12:13.520 --> 12:17.680
After a couple frustrating years searching around, they came across an article from a

12:17.680 --> 12:24.440
team of French scientists describing metal-like electrical conductivity at a rather high temperature,

12:24.440 --> 12:27.480
like 900 degrees Celsius high.

12:27.480 --> 12:29.040
That was interesting.

12:29.040 --> 12:33.200
Ceramics are traditionally known to be electrical insulators.

12:33.200 --> 12:38.280
After further experiments, the duo produced a ceramic compound of barium, lanthanum, copper,

12:38.280 --> 12:45.080
and oxygen that achieved superconductivity at 35 Kelvin, a legit breakthrough.

12:45.080 --> 12:50.320
As is so often in the land of superconductors, this discovery came as a total surprise.

12:50.320 --> 12:54.680
Bednorz and Muller first kept their results away from even their colleagues and their

12:54.680 --> 12:56.320
employer.

12:56.320 --> 13:01.280
They decided to first publish their results at a small but reputable German physics journal,

13:01.280 --> 13:04.720
apparently because they personally knew its editor.

13:04.720 --> 13:11.200
In April 1986, they submitted the paper, which was deliberately given a very disarming title,

13:11.200 --> 13:17.420
possible high TC superconductivity in the BALACUO system.

13:17.420 --> 13:21.320
They chose this title because the two were not sure about their result.

13:21.320 --> 13:25.640
For instance, the Meisner effect had not yet been measured in it.

13:25.640 --> 13:31.240
After some time, the paper was finally published in September 1986, but rumors had been circulating

13:31.240 --> 13:36.480
since July and they shook the scientific community like an earthquake.

13:36.480 --> 13:42.720
Not only because ceramics, like I said before, were not seen to be good conductors, but also

13:42.720 --> 13:48.120
Bednorz and Muller were seen as outsiders to the superconductor community working in

13:48.120 --> 13:51.320
a backwater of the IBM research machine.

13:51.320 --> 13:56.000
One prominent member of the community, jaded by false claims over the years, was tempted

13:56.000 --> 14:00.560
to simply throw the paper away when he first saw it.

14:00.560 --> 14:05.680
These new ceramics also violated the previously established rules of superconductors.

14:05.680 --> 14:13.040
It did not follow the Matthias rules and not only that, it highlighted a hole in BCS theory.

14:13.040 --> 14:20.000
By then, physicists had largely adopted BCS as a reasonably rigorous explanation of superconductivity

14:20.000 --> 14:25.360
and because BCS only worked in low temperatures, superconductivity in general was regarded

14:25.360 --> 14:29.040
as an exclusively low-temperature phenomenon.

14:29.040 --> 14:34.440
This discovery heralded a new class of ceramic oxide superconductors with high transition

14:34.440 --> 14:40.480
temperatures higher than ever before seen, referred to as high-temperature superconductors

14:40.480 --> 14:42.880
or high-T.

14:42.880 --> 14:46.160
Research teams around the world raced to replicate the results.

14:46.160 --> 14:52.920
In late November 1986, some two months after publication, the Asahi Shinbon newspaper reported

14:52.920 --> 14:59.360
that a team led by Shoji Tanaka of the University of Tokyo had successfully repeated the experiment

14:59.360 --> 15:01.680
confirming the results.

15:01.680 --> 15:07.000
A few weeks after that, Paul Chu of the University of Houston replicated the results.

15:07.000 --> 15:09.840
Chu's results made the headlines.

15:09.840 --> 15:14.080
More impressively, he believed that there were other materials out there with even higher

15:14.320 --> 15:16.320
transition temperatures.

15:16.320 --> 15:22.560
A race for new superconductors soon emerged with the big line being 77K, the temperature

15:22.560 --> 15:24.720
of liquid nitrogen.

15:24.720 --> 15:30.840
Various groups in Beijing, Tokyo and the US traded papers back and forth.

15:30.840 --> 15:36.200
Then in January 1987, Dr. Chu discovered a superconductor with a transition temperature

15:36.200 --> 15:41.640
above 90K, breaking the so-called liquid nitrogen barrier.

15:41.640 --> 15:46.920
Chu held off publishing for as long as possible as he first tried to patent the material.

15:46.920 --> 15:52.880
Finally, in February 1987, he announced his marvelous technical breakthrough.

15:52.880 --> 15:58.520
This class of high-temperature superconductors is sometimes called one-two-three superconductors

15:58.520 --> 16:04.320
because they have one atom of yttrium, two atoms of barium, and three atoms of copper.

16:04.320 --> 16:09.280
There is also some oxygen attached, but whatever it messes with the cool naming.

16:09.280 --> 16:15.160
These things are also more generally referred to as YBCO superconductors, cuprate superconductors,

16:15.160 --> 16:17.760
or rare earth cuprate superconductors.

16:17.760 --> 16:21.120
Oh hey, more rare earth stuff.

16:21.120 --> 16:23.880
Wonder who's the world leader in those?

16:23.880 --> 16:28.440
Anyway, all cuprate superconductors share the same structure.

16:28.440 --> 16:32.000
They are big layered compounds, kind of like cakes.

16:32.000 --> 16:37.800
Layers of copper oxygen separated from one another by insulating oxide layers.

16:37.800 --> 16:42.240
The superconductivity happens within those thin copper oxygen layers.

16:42.240 --> 16:44.720
We aren't exactly sure how it works.

16:44.720 --> 16:50.720
Cooper pairs are probably involved, but differently from how it is in BCS theory, making them

16:50.720 --> 16:54.440
unconventional superconductors.

16:54.440 --> 16:58.280
Cuprates broke the nitrogen barrier, which meant that we can use liquid nitrogen to cool

16:58.280 --> 17:02.320
them rather than liquid helium, which is what we used before.

17:02.320 --> 17:04.760
This has significant cost benefits.

17:04.920 --> 17:15.800
On March 15th, the American Physical Society held a special symposium on high-temperature

17:15.800 --> 17:19.800
superconductors specifically to talk about the results.

17:19.800 --> 17:24.840
Several thousand physicists gathered at the Hilton at what they now call the Woodstock

17:24.840 --> 17:26.560
of Physics.

17:26.560 --> 17:31.480
The highlight was a special evening session dedicated to the discovery held on Wednesday

17:31.480 --> 17:33.600
night in the Hilton Grand Ballroom.

17:33.600 --> 17:35.760
It was filled to the brink.

17:35.760 --> 17:43.360
The session started out at 7pm and ended at around 3am, a magical eight hours long.

17:43.360 --> 17:48.200
A gold rush was on for new materials based on this breakthrough.

17:48.200 --> 17:52.000
Superconductor-related headlines hit the media like the New York Times.

17:52.000 --> 17:58.120
Businessweek cried out, superconductors, more important than the light bulb and the transistor.

17:58.120 --> 18:00.120
The fever swept over Japan.

18:00.120 --> 18:05.240
Multiple ministries rapidly directed R&D spending into this new category.

18:05.240 --> 18:12.120
By 1988, Mindy's single biggest R&D expenditure was on high-temperature superconductors.

18:12.120 --> 18:19.480
The US, too, the White House even held a presidential conference on superconductivity in July 1987.

18:19.480 --> 18:25.120
Reagan proposed an 11-point plan to build new industries around this new technology.

18:25.120 --> 18:30.880
Tens of millions of dollars of federal R&D were funneled into superconductors.

18:30.880 --> 18:34.860
On the corporate front, IBM and Bell Labs faced off with one another.

18:34.860 --> 18:39.080
They joined the fray alongside a bunch of new startups with buzzy names like American

18:39.080 --> 18:45.520
Superconductor Corporation, Conductus, Illinois Superconductor Incorporated, and Superconducting

18:45.520 --> 18:48.280
Technologies Incorporated.

18:48.280 --> 18:51.280
The discoveries kept coming throughout 1987.

18:51.280 --> 18:56.560
By playing around with the original barium, lanthanum, copper, and oxygen ceramic formula,

18:56.560 --> 19:02.080
researchers were able to find corporate superconductors with increasingly higher transition temperatures.

19:02.080 --> 19:06.720
But the gaps between science and technology can be quite large and take a long time to

19:06.720 --> 19:07.720
overcome.

19:07.720 --> 19:12.480
As it turns out, transition temperature was only one of the factors that engineers have

19:12.480 --> 19:16.200
to consider when building commercially viable systems.

19:16.200 --> 19:19.880
For instance, take superconducting wires for MRI machines.

19:19.880 --> 19:24.640
The original promise of high-temperature superconductors was that we can swap out more expensive liquid

19:24.640 --> 19:28.320
helium cooling systems for cheaper liquid nitrogen ones.

19:28.320 --> 19:30.120
Should be easy, right?

19:30.120 --> 19:34.200
But as Cameron Ling-Ona has found out long before, superconducting wires need to also

19:34.200 --> 19:38.960
be able to carry high current densities and withstand very high magnetic fields.

19:38.960 --> 19:42.200
In other words, they need to meet their critical parameters.

19:42.200 --> 19:47.400
The corporate high-temperature superconductors do indeed have much higher transition temperatures,

19:47.400 --> 19:51.720
but their other critical parameters are not as dramatically higher.

19:51.720 --> 19:55.640
There was also a substantial materials engineering problem.

19:55.640 --> 20:01.040
Corporate superconductors are ceramics, complicated materials that are very brittle to work with.

20:01.040 --> 20:04.760
This by itself limited their usefulness as a material.

20:04.760 --> 20:06.520
They also work differently.

20:06.520 --> 20:10.880
If you recall, the cuprits are layered cakes, and all the superconducting happens within

20:10.880 --> 20:14.840
those single flat layers of copper and oxygen.

20:14.840 --> 20:19.160
This imposes big challenges on how we might achieve this superconductivity.

20:19.160 --> 20:24.040
If we want to produce a wire using this material, it needs to be done in a specific way in order

20:24.040 --> 20:28.520
to maintain good alignment over potentially hundreds of meters.

20:28.520 --> 20:33.000
So it took a substantial amount of time to eventually engineer wire using high-temperature

20:33.000 --> 20:34.000
superconductors.

20:34.000 --> 20:39.160
They do exist, and are used for things like cables for power usage, but that took years

20:39.160 --> 20:41.200
to develop.

20:41.200 --> 20:45.520
Even if there are certain applications where the high-tea cuprits superconductors still

20:45.520 --> 20:48.560
fall short of established technologies.

20:48.560 --> 20:54.240
Neobium titanium established all the way back in 1970 continues to dominate superconducting

20:54.240 --> 21:00.720
wires for MRI machines, mostly due to their superior mechanical properties.

21:00.720 --> 21:05.520
The slow speed of commercialization dampened enthusiasm and unfortunately high-temperature

21:05.520 --> 21:11.320
superconductors could not uncover that golden killer app that would stimulate more investment

21:11.320 --> 21:12.920
into the space.

21:12.920 --> 21:17.120
Over time, the height receded as it became clear that the cuprits did not present a

21:17.120 --> 21:21.680
way towards room-temperature superconductivity.

21:21.680 --> 21:25.600
The scientific community did not forget Bednor's and Muller, though.

21:25.600 --> 21:30.520
Just 16 months after their discovery, the tube won the Nobel Prize in Physics, the record

21:30.520 --> 21:35.480
for the fastest recognition in Nobel physics history.

21:35.480 --> 21:39.640
Superconductor research continued for another high-temperature alternative to the cuprits

21:39.640 --> 21:40.640
superconductors.

21:40.640 --> 21:48.560
In 2001, a Japanese team discovered an interesting non-cuprits superconductor magnesium diboride.

21:48.560 --> 21:54.040
Its transition temperature was 39 Kelvin, far below the cuprits, but at least much higher

21:54.040 --> 21:57.080
than the traditional low-temperature superconductors.

21:57.080 --> 22:03.160
Unfortunately, its behavior was conventional BCS, so a dead end.

22:03.160 --> 22:08.720
The next significant high-temperature discovery came in February 2008, when Dr. Hideo Hosono

22:08.720 --> 22:15.520
reported a fluorine-doped iron-based superconductor with a transition temperature of 26 Kelvin.

22:15.520 --> 22:20.640
This opened up a new branch of high-temperature superconductors separate from the cuprits.

22:20.640 --> 22:22.640
At the outset, there was a lot of hope.

22:22.640 --> 22:28.040
A few months another iron superconductor was found with a transition temperature of 56

22:28.040 --> 22:32.080
Kelvin, but progress there has since stalled.

22:32.080 --> 22:37.760
And then, recently in 2015, a team in Germany published a paper claiming superconductivity

22:37.760 --> 22:42.560
in sulfur hydrides at over 200 Kelvin and high pressure.

22:42.560 --> 22:47.520
Interesting but again nothing that has real-world industrial implications.

22:47.520 --> 22:53.520
And there have been some questions about superconductivity in these sulfide hydrides.

22:53.520 --> 22:59.960
One recent controversial room temperature claim was recently retracted by Nature Magazine.

22:59.960 --> 23:05.080
The search continues for a room-temperature superconductor, or even a relatively high-temperature

23:05.080 --> 23:10.480
superconductor with fewer engineering compromises than what we already have.

23:10.480 --> 23:12.740
Is LK99 really it?

23:12.740 --> 23:16.320
I don't know, but will it really change everything if it was?

23:16.320 --> 23:18.480
Is it really the next transistor?

23:18.480 --> 23:21.160
It is hard for me to believe that.

23:21.160 --> 23:25.920
When we dream of room-temperature superconductors, we talk about things like levitating trains,

23:25.920 --> 23:30.000
compact MRIs, economical fusion energy, and the like.

23:30.000 --> 23:34.000
Well, they have been citing these things since 1986.

23:34.000 --> 23:39.680
Many applications are already technically possible with existing low-temperature superconductors.

23:39.680 --> 23:44.920
But there are real economic reasons why we don't have those today.

23:44.920 --> 23:47.620
For instance, magnets for maglev trains.

23:47.620 --> 23:51.400
The magnets are not a significant portion of the financial costs for these machines.

23:51.800 --> 23:57.360
It is tied to the cost of the land, the labor, the extensive planning, and the construction.

23:57.360 --> 24:00.880
And then there is always the chance that a room-temperature superconductor, whether

24:00.880 --> 24:06.160
LK99 is it or not, cannot compete with existing economic solutions.

24:06.160 --> 24:07.920
Look again at the MRI.

24:07.920 --> 24:12.680
Intuitively, you might think that this new generation of high-temperature cuprits would

24:12.680 --> 24:18.800
sweep out the old superconducting wire tech used for those MRIs like yesterday's trash.

24:18.800 --> 24:21.360
But it turned out to be far more subtle than that.

24:21.360 --> 24:27.720
Even today, 30 years later, 80-90% of today's MRI machines are still made with good old

24:27.720 --> 24:30.000
niobium titanium.

24:30.000 --> 24:32.920
Just working these things into wires might take years.

24:32.920 --> 24:34.960
Remember these things are layered cakes.

24:34.960 --> 24:37.800
Imagine making a cake hundreds of miles long.

24:37.800 --> 24:41.960
Real-world applications might be years and millions of dollars away.

24:41.960 --> 24:43.640
But hey, I hope I'm wrong.

24:43.640 --> 24:46.240
I love the excitement around LK99.

24:46.240 --> 24:50.760
No matter the outcome, the fascinating science of superconductivity is having another one

24:50.760 --> 24:52.600
of its unique moments.

24:52.600 --> 24:55.360
This only happens ever so often in the world.

24:55.360 --> 24:56.360
Let's enjoy it.

24:56.360 --> 24:57.600
Alright everyone, that's it for tonight.

24:57.600 --> 24:58.600
Thanks for watching.
