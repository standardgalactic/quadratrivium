0	7080	While working at Control Data Corporation, computer designer Seymour Cray was once asked
7080	9400	his five and one year goals.
9400	10400	He said,
10400	14440	5 year goal, build the biggest computer in the world.
14440	17840	One year goal, one fifth of the above.
17840	23400	Seymour Cray literally only wanted one thing, and that was to take it to the limit.
23400	28640	In today's video we look back at a genius' lifelong quest to make the biggest supercomputers.
29600	32960	But first, this video is brought to you by the Asianometry Patreon.
32960	37920	Early access members get to see new videos first and selected references for those videos.
37920	41200	Early access really helps a lot and I appreciate every pledge.
41200	42960	Thank you, and on with the show.
43920	49760	Seymour Cray Jr. was born in the small town of Chippewa Falls, Wisconsin, in 1925.
49760	52720	The son of a civil engineer at the local power utility.
53520	57440	The elder Cray fostered in his son a love of science and engineering.
57440	63040	The son adored chemistry, did electrician work for his junior prom, and showed a talent for radio.
63920	68720	After serving in the army as an electrician, Cray went to university on the GI Bill and
68720	73360	graduated from the University of Minnesota with a bachelor's in electrical engineering
73360	74960	and a master's in applied math.
75840	80240	Then in 1950 he joined a small company called Engineering Research Associates,
80240	82880	or ERA, in St. Paul, Minnesota.
83120	88320	During World War II, the U.S. Navy employed a team of elite code breakers.
89120	94080	This division was known as the Communication Supplementary Activity Washington, or CESA,
94640	99120	and in secret they designed and built powerful machines to break access naval codes,
99120	100880	mostly to find German submarines.
101920	106400	At the war's end, people realized that the U.S. government still needed to break codes,
106400	110800	Soviet codes this time, but with budget cuts they cannot afford to keep their employees.
111600	115040	So the Navy worked with an investment banker named John Parker
115040	118800	to set up a for-profit company that would hire and employ the old team
118800	120080	at higher salaries.
120080	121120	This was ERA.
122240	126800	ERA's people worked largely in secret out of an old glider factory.
126800	129760	Their first products were code-breaking machines like before,
130720	134960	but the team quickly began moving towards useful general-purpose computers,
134960	138160	leveraging emerging technologies like magnetic drum memory.
138960	142320	One of the first such products was the ERA1101.
142320	147600	The computer was a commercialized version of a device sold to one of the precursors of the NSA.
148560	153520	You can say that Minnesota in the 1950s was Silicon Valley before Silicon Valley existed.
154160	158640	Thanks to the strong military presence, it was America's premier computing center.
160720	164800	Despite being just 25 years old, Cray showed himself to be a talented worker.
165440	170080	Cray was quiet, but had the unshakable confidence to speak up when something was wrong.
170640	174800	He had incredible focus and rigid discipline, and of course he was brilliant,
174800	177680	with a gift for understanding the world of binary numbers.
178560	182960	Thus, Cray was challenged to produce the control system for ERA's next computer,
182960	184480	the ERA1103.
185120	189840	The control system breaks down the software's instructions into execution steps.
190640	194880	Control system design required front-to-back knowledge of the computer's guts
194880	199360	because it had to coordinate all those resources to efficiently execute the program.
200000	203760	Cray did the work and quickly rose up the ranks to supervise the team.
204960	208080	Like another legend of the times on Wong of Wong Labs,
208080	211520	Seymour Cray's genius can make him sometimes difficult to work for.
212080	216080	Cray preferred to work alone, spending late nights in the workshop.
216080	219520	If someone wasn't doing it right or was taking too long,
219520	221760	he reassigned them and did it himself.
222320	224000	They called it being scrayed.
224800	228560	But despite being very quiet, Seymour treated his colleagues well
228560	231120	and was generally liked and respected.
231120	236400	Just a big eccentric and enigmatic, exactly as a genius computer designer should be.
238080	242320	In December 1951, President and original investor John Parker
242320	245200	sold ERA to the computer company, Remington Rand.
246080	249440	Parker didn't tell the employees that ERA about this
249440	252160	which in bird culture is considered a dick move.
252880	255680	And an angered key workers like William Norris
255680	258960	who joined early and rose to become VP of operations.
260080	263280	Remington Rand was a typewriter and shaver company.
263280	264160	Why computers?
264800	268880	Even more strangely, Rand had already bought a computer company earlier,
268880	271200	the Eckhart Mockley Computer Corporation.
272160	276720	Jay Presper Eckhart and John Mockley will forever be known for making ENIAC,
276720	278720	the first programmable digital computer.
279520	283440	And then EDVAC, pioneering the stored program computer design
283440	286320	that today underpins the von Neumann architecture.
287200	292080	Along the way, Eckhart also created the first course on electronic digital computers,
292080	296880	the Moore School Lectures, which helped popularize the von Neumann architecture.
296880	298320	No relation to Moore's law.
299120	302880	And then UNIVAC won, a computer that Garnard renowned for predicting
302880	308400	that some dude named Dwight Eisenhower would win the 1952 U.S. presidential election.
309440	313040	The world famous Eckhart and Mockley had serious computer credentials,
313040	316080	so the guys at ERA accepted the arrangement.
316080	319520	Eckhart Mockley would focus on the business computer marketplace
319520	322240	while ERA focused on scientific computing.
323120	324560	But tensions remained.
324560	327680	Today the computing needs of both business and science
327680	330320	can be handled by a general purpose computer,
330320	333120	but in those days the computers had to be more specific.
334400	337760	Computers for business did simple operations,
337760	342640	adding, subtracting, and multiplying, and with only two decimal points of accuracy.
343200	346480	However, this had to be done at large scale,
346480	349120	thousands of rows going in and out of the computer.
350400	354800	Scientific computing was different in that it required complex calculations
354800	357680	with up to 20 to 30 decimal points of accuracy.
358320	363520	Such a computer might munch on a problem for hours just to produce a single line of output.
364480	366960	The guys at Eckhart Mockley in Philadelphia
366960	370320	looked down on the Minnesota guys as mere quote-unquote farmers
370320	372240	who did not work on the state of the art,
372800	376400	and the Minnesota guys saw the Philadelphians as theoreticians
376400	379200	who only cared about making computers faster,
379200	381440	even if it meant them breaking down a lot.
382720	389520	Things got worse in 1955 when Rand merged with the Sperry Corporation to become Sperry Rand.
389680	395360	The merger forced together the two formerly independent units into one Unifact division.
396400	401840	The tensions really flared between ERA, Eckhart, and their new corporate overlords.
401840	403600	The aforementioned William Norris,
403600	407360	the division's new general manager, said to the Philadelphia guys,
407360	411360	you people run a laboratory, and ERA runs a business.
412560	417120	When Sperry took over its top management, including President Harry Vickers,
417120	421200	thought that they were buying a market leader. That was not the case.
421200	425280	Unifact had the potential to be what IBM eventually became,
425280	430080	but it needed the capital to get there. Not only in R&D to build the machines,
430080	434720	but also because computers were an equipment leasing business back then.
434720	436400	It was very capital intensive.
437440	443440	In 1957, enough was enough. Norris left Sperry Rand to found a new company,
443440	448720	Control Data Corporation, or CDC. A new company was a huge risk,
448720	452480	but Norris figured that if it did not work, then he and his family
452480	454640	could go back to their farm in Nebraska.
455600	458720	Norris invited a few of his ERA co-workers to come with him.
459280	463520	Cray was one of those who accepted, having seen the writing on the wall when he noticed
463520	469360	an accounting system categorize his project as 999, miscellaneous, and other.
470320	478080	CDC started in July 1957 with its employees, a vague idea to make computers and some money from
478080	485920	friends. No plant, no product, and little money. To get the company off the ground, CDC IPO'd.
485920	490720	Like literally, they stood on the street and sold shares to ordinary members of the public
490720	494160	for a dollar each. This is probably not possible today.
495120	498960	The company got its first splash of publicity from an unexpected spot.
499600	504800	Sid Hartman, a sports columnist at the Minneapolis Tribune and former part-time
504800	507120	general manager of the Minneapolis Lakers, what?
507760	510560	Mentioned the move at the end of one of his sports column.
511520	515440	Many prominent local investors declined an investment in CDC,
515440	520720	one saying that they, quote, didn't have a ghost of a chance, end quote, against IBM.
521680	527200	Decliners included a guy named Warren Buffett. Despite being William Norris' nephew by marriage,
527200	532320	he declined due to a lack of understanding, but he's poor now and deeply regrets that.
533280	537440	Years later, the $1 shares would be worth about many times that.
537440	543440	The early CDC IPO enriched the company's 300 initial investors and created a generation
543440	545360	of new wealth in the Minnesota area.
546000	551520	Craig was the most technical person at the new company and persuaded his co-founders to
551520	557280	build scientific computers rather than going to the commercial market. His reasoning was that
557280	562800	their clientele universities and nuclear weapons research labs cared less about marketing and
562800	569200	client service and they programmed their own software. What they wanted was compute, serious
569200	575120	compute. Due to treaty obligations, you can't just test fire a nuclear weapon and even discounting
575120	581920	the environmental issues cannot easily measure its workings. So to study a detonation, we needed
581920	588400	computers to simulate the bomb's chain reactions, stepping through all the equations every microsecond
588400	593600	after detonation. That means the biggest and fastest computers on the market.
594480	599760	Craig was convinced that he could build such a computer at a relatively bearable cost using
599840	605120	transistors. He went down to the local electronics shop and found that they were selling reject
605120	609680	bipolar transistors for radios for cheaper than what you can get from the factory.
610560	617040	These reject transistors suck outputting a weak signal. So Craig paired them up in what is called
617040	623120	a Darlington pair with the second transistor amplifying the output of the first. The experience
623120	628560	taught him that with the right design, you can use substandard components and still achieve the goal.
629760	634720	Over a year into the venture with money running low, Bill Norris strikes a deal with the US Navy
634720	642320	for what would be called the CDC-1604 computer in 1958. But now they have to build it at scale,
642320	647440	buying a factory and hiring more engineers. Norris and other managers cut their salaries
647440	653040	in half to save money. Engineers resorted to swiping transistor companies as free-sales
653040	660640	samples for their computer. The CDC-1604 first hit the market in 1960, carrying a price tag of
660640	669440	$990,000 or about $10.4 million today. At 0.2 MHz, it was the most powerful commercially available
669440	677040	computer of the time, a supercomputer. A supercomputer is a bit of a squishy term. It's about pushing
677040	681760	the envelope and computing, bringing out a computer that leads all others in its field.
682400	687120	Control data was not alone in the market of producing super-fast computers for niche customers.
687840	694400	Univac released the Livermore Automatic Reaction Calculator, LARC, in 1960, the same year as the
694400	700640	1604's release. It helped Edward Teller do simulations for the hydrogen bomb and was the most
700640	708000	powerful computer in the world from 1960 to 1961. The LARC scared IBM so much that they built the
708000	715120	IBM-7030 stretch supercomputer designed by the legendary Gene Amdahl. The 7030 took back the
715120	722080	crown of the world's most powerful supercomputer and retained it until 1964. But the LARC and
722080	729200	Stretch were basically made to order products. Univac only made two LARC units. Control data
729200	733680	turned the supercomputer into a category, a commercially successful one at that.
734320	740000	The 1604 sold to the University of Illinois, Lockheed, the State of Israel, and more.
740800	746080	The company began to turn a profit, challenging the old computer giants like Rand and IBM.
746720	753120	CDC stock went from $1 to $9, and now Norris had to keep the engineers from selling their stock
753120	761520	too early. After the 1604, Cray and CDC debated about how to proceed. Follow up on the 1604
761520	766560	and finally attack the lucrative business data processing market. This would mean iterating
766560	773840	on the 1604 architecture, making smaller computers like the CDC 160A a very good and successful
773840	780320	control applications computer. But Cray only wanted to build the fastest possible machine.
780320	785600	The scientific community had only started to realize a new form of computational modeling,
785600	789040	finite element analysis, which I mentioned in a prior video.
790080	795120	Finite element analysis involves splitting something down into millions of simpler elements
795120	801200	and running simulations based on how those elements might act. For instance, breaking a car down into
801200	807360	tiny shapes and using that to predict how it might survive a car crash. With finite element analysis,
807360	812000	the more steps you can break something down into, the better you can model and predict
812000	818480	complex systems like the weather or nuclear explosions. This basically implied an infinite
818480	825600	need for compute. Cray wanted to be the guy to feed that need for speed. He threatened to
825600	830720	leave the company over this issue, which caused Norris to eventually agree on splitting the two
830720	838240	teams. One CDC team would work on a 1604 follow up. Meanwhile, the 35 year old Cray and his team
838320	844160	were allowed to open their own lab in Cray's hometown of Chippewa Falls, Wisconsin. This new
844160	849520	lab was just a brief stroll from his house. There, Cray and his team worked on a machine
849520	858000	some 15 times faster than the 1604, named the 6600. When Cray and his team sat down to make
858000	865680	the CDC 6600, they started off with something like the 1604. The 1604 was built with ferrite
865680	871920	magnetic cores for main memory and magnetic tape for secondary storage. For compute, it had
871920	877120	germanium transistors. Everything was built inside air-cooled, pluggable building blocks.
878000	884880	But as they worked on the 6600, Cray changed many things. Critically, he saw silicon planar
884880	889520	transistors from Fairchild. They switched far faster than germanium transistors,
890080	897120	automatically granting a 5x speed boost. The rest of the 10-15x speed up goal, though,
897120	902720	had to come from somewhere else. Cray soon soured on the building block approach. Each
902720	908640	block had extensive back panel wiring, which not only caused noise issues but also limited input
908640	914960	output and increased how long it took to transmit data. So Cray threw it all out and switched to
915040	921920	using denser, more complex custom modules called cordwood modules. The shorter wires improved
921920	927520	speed but also made it difficult to repair and necessitated the replacement of air cooling
927520	934080	with freon gas cooling. Another concept they implemented was parallelism. Every system has
934080	940160	to do housekeeping functions or the such in addition to the main compute task. Why should the main
940160	948000	processor have to do that? Offloaded to something else. The 6600 contained 11 individual computers
948000	952560	that can execute programs separately from each other. They only shared a central memory.
953120	958320	10 of the computers handled secondary work like peripherals leaving the 11th computer free to
958320	965920	do nothing but high speed math. Additionally, the 6600 lived and breathed simplicity. A computer
965920	972560	CPU uses something called an instruction set architecture or ISA to define its basic operations
972560	980640	thus also defining how software can control it. The 6600 simplified its ISA ditching everything
980640	986960	unrelated to scientific computing like for instance instructions for handling large amounts of data
986960	993040	something more geared for commercial users. This simplified instruction set allowed the computer
993040	999040	to quote quote pipeline tasks breaking down a bigger job to smaller ones that can be assigned
999040	1006960	to peripheral computers to work on simultaneously. CDC delivered its first 6600 to Lawrence Livermore
1006960	1015360	in 1964. The machine's incredible speed three times faster than the 7030 shocked IBM. Chairman
1015360	1022000	Thomas J. Watson Jr. wrote a scathing memo asking how quote 34 people including the janitor and quote
1022560	1028320	beat the biggest technology company in the world. The answer of course was that IBM's architects
1028320	1035280	could not bear to sacrifice compatibility for speed. The splitting of the teams within control
1035280	1041280	data prevented a blow up but discontent continued to faster. Norris and other managers continued
1041280	1047040	to build up the business. CDC began making its own peripherals and software to accompany the main
1047120	1053440	computer building a services business. Control data also purchased a consumer finance company
1053440	1059840	commercial credit intending to use their 3.4 billion dollars of working capital to fund its
1059840	1066240	computer leasing strategy. This strategy which seemed smart at the time eventually backfired
1066240	1073840	when commercial credit ran into difficulties. Over 100 CDC 6600s were sold to big customers
1073840	1079280	like the atomic energy commission but each cost 8 million dollars or about 23 million today.
1079920	1084720	As you might think it limited the market to about 50 total customers in the world.
1085760	1091440	But Seymour Cray felt this was a feature not a bug. He loved knowing the first names of each
1091440	1096880	of his customers. The control data's management was increasingly coming to the belief that
1096880	1104000	peripherals and services not hardware were the company's future. Control data followed up the
1104000	1111280	CDC 6600 with the 7600 and it was hailed as the world's fastest computer five times faster than
1111280	1117680	the 6600. But despite costing only twice as much of its predecessor it sold poorly in part due to
1117680	1125120	frequent breakdowns and a weak economy. Then after that we had the 8600. This supercomputer was made
1125120	1131840	with regular discrete transistors but Cray wanted a clock cycle time of 8 nanoseconds which meant
1131840	1137360	every wire had to be shorter than 2.5 meters squeezing those parts very close together.
1138480	1143440	Things got so dense that Cray couldn't figure out how to sufficiently cool them.
1143440	1149120	After many months he decided to throw everything out and start again from scratch. It was his style
1149120	1156480	the Cray way. But this was 1971 and control data was in the midst of an expensive antitrust lawsuit
1156480	1163920	against IBM. Cash flow was running low. Cray was asked to cut expenses by 10% unwilling to do that
1163920	1171200	he cut his own salary to minimum wage or $1.25 an hour. This did not solve the issue and in the
1171200	1177440	end Norris told Cray that a redo like before could not be done. They already pre-sold two 8600
1177440	1185920	systems and in 1972 Cray decided to leave and start his own shop Cray Research. Seymour Cray
1185920	1192560	founded Cray Research with $2.5 million, 20% of which was his own money and a bunch of bank loans.
1193120	1198400	The company's goal was to build the biggest computer one at a time like a master artisan.
1198400	1203520	It did not care for big revenues nor did it expect them. The focus was on research rather
1203520	1210240	than manufacture like Star Trek plumbing the outer limits of possibility. In a show of goodwill
1210240	1215600	Norris and control data arranged a luncheon to say goodbye and invested a quarter million dollars in
1215600	1222560	the new company. Norris called it heart money. For his first computer the Cray one Seymour Cray
1222560	1229120	wanted revolutionary performance to get it he decided to turn to a new concept vector processing.
1230080	1236160	Most CPUs of the time used scalar processing meaning the process single data items like integers
1236160	1242800	or floating point numbers one at a time. So imagine the job of adding one in one a scalar
1242800	1248960	CPU would load the first one into its register from memory load the second one add them and then
1248960	1255200	store the result into memory counted up this job used four instructions. So if we are summing up
1255200	1262560	two sets of 20 numbers that is 80 instructions that a scalar CPU has to handle a vector processing
1262560	1268000	machine shortcuts that by processing single dimension arrays of data vectors. So if we
1268000	1273200	have those two vectors containing 20 numbers each loading the two vectors into the register
1273200	1279200	adding them and storing the result vector into memory that only uses four instructions rather
1279200	1285360	than 80. Control data knew about vector processing too they had a small team working on a vector
1285360	1290800	computer called the star 100 but the star was tremendously complicated and failed to live
1290800	1295920	up to its promises. Control data shipped it four years late and sold only three of them.
1296960	1303120	Cray studied the star 100 and realized its flaws first its scalar processing was slow
1303120	1308880	bottlenecking the overall system performance and second the computer's vector processing
1308880	1314640	implementation had a hitch recall my example from before before you can run the addition
1314640	1320000	operation on the two vectors you first have to load them both into the register same with
1320000	1325520	sending results back to memory. The problem was that this was taking too long doesn't
1325520	1330640	matter how much faster vector processing is compared to scalar processing if handling the
1330640	1336960	vectors took forever. So Cray introduced vector registers very fast intermediate memory systems
1336960	1343040	that work like cache memory to improve speed. Seymour also decided to adopt integrated circuits
1343040	1348560	for the first time this allowed for more density and cut down on wiring allowing the Cray one to
1348560	1355600	be far smaller than its predecessors. By then ICs were roughly about 14 years old and quite mature
1355600	1361040	but reflects Cray's approach of choosing older technologies quote a decade behind end quote as
1361040	1367520	he'd like to say so that they are more reliable but when it came to memory Cray could not compromise
1367520	1372000	he broke his principle and bought bipolar semiconductor memory chips to replace the
1372000	1379280	old core memories it cost less had more density and eight less power. The computer's clock cycle
1379280	1386080	of 12.5 nanoseconds made it five times faster than the CDC 7600 so every wire in the machine had to
1386080	1392720	be less than four feet long and of course you can't forget its iconic look a circular shape to
1392720	1397520	accommodate the new cooling scheme but with an added bit of flair to differentiate from the
1397520	1404560	boring gray boxes of the era and it had cushions too. The Cray one made a huge stir upon its release
1404560	1410720	in 1976 with its flashy look and world-beating speed. A hundred Cray ones were sold to various
1410720	1416000	government and university lab customers like the National Center for Atmospheric Research
1416000	1424240	and the Department of Defense. It generated 150 revenue growth for Cray research from 1978 to 1979
1424240	1430480	with another 50 growth a year after that. The orders came in so fast one a month which is a lot
1430480	1436560	for eight million dollar product that a big backlog developed. IBM did not even try to compete
1437200	1443200	Cray's former employer control data found itself thrown off its feet they tried producing vector
1443200	1450960	computers like the cyber 205 but they had gotten bloated and complicated unable to keep up. The
1450960	1455440	company suffered large financial losses and eventually sold itself off in pieces by the
1455440	1462320	mid 1980s CDC's most profitable business was Ticketron a rival to the widely despised Ticketmaster.
1464000	1468720	As I said Seymour Cray wanted to build the fastest computer and to build it from a clean
1468720	1475040	piece of paper. Even as the Cray one was in the late stages of development Seymour started to shift
1475040	1481680	his gaze towards a machine even more ambitious the Cray two with a clock speed some three to six
1481760	1488320	times faster than its predecessor. Such a machine had obstacles with that clock speed no wire can
1488320	1493600	be longer than 40 centimeters again bringing back the same heating challenges Cray faced with the
1493600	1500960	8600 and to his dismay Seymour could not focus on solving these problems because his business needed
1500960	1506640	him to fund early development Cray research IPO did stock which brought on a whole load of new
1506640	1513680	responsibilities and a bit poetically the company's success caused new headaches since each Cray one
1513680	1519760	was hand-wired and custom-made like some limited edition supercar a process that took a year the
1519760	1527040	company had no choice but to staff up to deliver on his big backlog from 1978 to 1980 the company
1527040	1535040	grew from 300 to 500 people rapid growth and at its peak Cray research employed over 5000 people
1535040	1541280	in the tiny town of Chippewa Falls Wisconsin Seymour originally pursued scientific computing
1541280	1547840	because users wrote their own hardware it let him just focus on hardware but times had changed
1547840	1553920	customers no longer had the budget to rewrite their software every time they wanted portability
1553920	1560080	it is why the Unix operating system got to be so popular so Cray's customers were increasingly
1560080	1565600	interested in getting a better Cray one than a radically different Cray two which would require
1565600	1574000	them to redo all their software it was the story of control data in the 1604 all over again eventually
1574000	1580400	Cray research's management including CEO John Rohlwagen did the dual approach once more on one
1580400	1586320	side they extended the Cray one line with the 1s still a powerful computer but not radically different
1586320	1592640	like a Cray two might be meanwhile Seymour Cray stepped down as chairman in 1981 handing that
1592640	1597680	job over to the CEO Rohlwagen and became an independent contractor so that he could work on
1597680	1604400	the Cray two he moved to Boulder Colorado to work in peace once more the Cray two eventually did
1604400	1611040	come out in 1985 after three false starts on the cooling system famously had this massive liquid
1611040	1616640	immersion cooling system that caused the machine to resemble an aquarium even so memory latency
1616640	1622960	caused the system to underperform its full potential then to the surprise of many Seymour's Cray two
1622960	1630000	found itself upstaged by another computer produced by a separate team the Cray XMP supercomputer the
1630000	1635920	XMP team was led by a longtime Cray collaborator named Les Davis as well as a talented young
1635920	1642800	Taiwanese-American designer named Steve Chen where the Cray one had a single CPU the XMP
1642800	1649120	introduced parallel processing with four CPUs along with new solid state storage semiconductors
1649680	1656320	released in 1983 the XMP was the world's fastest supercomputer two to five times faster than the
1656320	1663840	1s without the radical design changes of the Cray two people were stunned it sold very well compared
1663840	1670880	to the Cray two by 1989 there were only 24 units of the Cray two sold as compared to the almost 200
1670880	1679120	units sold of the XMP and its immediate successor the YMP there were other changes in the 1970s Cray
1679120	1684320	had no competitors for its unique part of the market but throughout the 1980s new supercomputer
1684320	1692000	competitors started to emerge out of the woodwork first over in Japan where Fujitsu Hitachi and NEC
1692000	1696960	leveraged Japan's growing advantages in VLSI semiconductor production to make compelling
1696960	1703120	supercomputers Cray still dominated the market in 1988 they had 56 percent market share of
1703120	1708720	traditional supercomputers but the Japanese all together had 37 percent and were making ground
1709840	1715120	in a similar vein supercomputer startups like Thinking Machines and N-Cube began exploring
1715120	1719840	new approaches of supercomputing beyond just vector computing the most prominent of which are
1719840	1726640	massively parallel systems or MPPs these systems coordinate many commercial microprocessors to do
1726640	1732240	millions or even billions of floating point operations each second these microprocessors
1732240	1738640	being bought off the shelf meant far better price for performance this combined competition from the
1738640	1744400	startups the Japanese and even old friends like control data supercomputer spin-off ETA systems
1744400	1748720	put a lot of pressure on Cray to focus this approach and its product lineup
1749600	1755440	Cray researchers unexpected success with the XMP would come back to haunted designer Steve Chen
1755440	1760800	was featured as one of the company's young exciting rising talents the next Seymour Cray even
1760800	1766320	but unfortunately the aggressive vision that Chen and his team had for the MP line after the YMP
1766320	1773360	spiraled beyond what the company can financially support 64 processors custom integrated circuits
1773360	1779600	and maybe even optical interconnects in 1987 the company was already invested in developing
1779600	1785920	Seymour Cray's next machine the Cray 3 and the YMP in addition to three existing products that needed
1785920	1792800	money too they had no money for Chen's science fiction dream so that year Cray research scaled
1792800	1798320	back the MP line of computers in response the much heralded Steve Chen quit Cray research
1798400	1804560	and started his own company Supercomputer Systems Supercomputer Systems took 150 million
1804560	1810160	dollars of investment money from IBM and other investors like Ford and Boeing but went bankrupt
1810160	1817760	in 1993 in 1989 the company could no longer accommodate its former founder Seymour Cray
1817760	1824240	joined a spin-off called Cray Computer Corporation or CCC in Colorado to work on the future Cray 3
1824960	1831360	Cray research thusly would go onwards with the existing Cray XMP architecture building the ecosystem
1832320	1836720	the Cray 3 would have used gallium arsenide semiconductors for switching performance far
1836720	1842000	faster than what was possible with silicon it necessitated buying a lot of chip making equipment
1842880	1849200	the Cray 3 soon fell behind and in 1991 various customers started canceling their orders because
1849200	1855520	of cratering defense demand after the fall of the Soviet Union CCC would only sell one system
1855520	1862720	before filing for bankruptcy in 1995 and announced Cray 4 never materialized either Seymour Cray's
1862720	1868560	cherished approach of sitting down with a clean sheet of paper and building a big iron supercomputer
1868560	1876000	was no longer financially viable Seymour Cray formed a new company SRC computers to begin exploring
1876000	1883360	parallel designs but he then passed away in 1996 at the age of 71 due to injuries from a car accident
1884560	1888960	Cray research was eventually sold to Silicon Graphics and it bounced around for a while
1888960	1892640	but is now part of Hewlett Packard Enterprise as just Cray Inc.
1894560	1899680	Advancing semiconductor technologies have made the supercomputers of the past seem comically behind
1900400	1905600	in 2010 an electrical engineer named Chris Fenton did a project to emulate the Cray 1a
1905600	1912480	supercomputer using a Xilinx Spartan 3e 1600 development board he even put it into a cute
1912480	1918400	little Cray 1 package and it now sits in the computer history museum where it inspired this video
1919520	1924960	today's leading edge semiconductor makers now face the same issues as Cray did with his supercomputers
1925040	1930480	thermal problems interconnect problems slowdowns due to memory retrieval I am struck
1930480	1936240	by the similarities unfortunately the semiconductor industry cannot do as Seymour did
1936240	1941760	throw it all out and start anew with a fresh sheet of paper all right everyone that's it for
