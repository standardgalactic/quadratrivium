00:00.000 --> 00:07.080
While working at Control Data Corporation, computer designer Seymour Cray was once asked

00:07.080 --> 00:09.400
his five and one year goals.

00:09.400 --> 00:10.400
He said,

00:10.400 --> 00:14.440
5 year goal, build the biggest computer in the world.

00:14.440 --> 00:17.840
One year goal, one fifth of the above.

00:17.840 --> 00:23.400
Seymour Cray literally only wanted one thing, and that was to take it to the limit.

00:23.400 --> 00:28.640
In today's video we look back at a genius' lifelong quest to make the biggest supercomputers.

00:29.600 --> 00:32.960
But first, this video is brought to you by the Asianometry Patreon.

00:32.960 --> 00:37.920
Early access members get to see new videos first and selected references for those videos.

00:37.920 --> 00:41.200
Early access really helps a lot and I appreciate every pledge.

00:41.200 --> 00:42.960
Thank you, and on with the show.

00:43.920 --> 00:49.760
Seymour Cray Jr. was born in the small town of Chippewa Falls, Wisconsin, in 1925.

00:49.760 --> 00:52.720
The son of a civil engineer at the local power utility.

00:53.520 --> 00:57.440
The elder Cray fostered in his son a love of science and engineering.

00:57.440 --> 01:03.040
The son adored chemistry, did electrician work for his junior prom, and showed a talent for radio.

01:03.920 --> 01:08.720
After serving in the army as an electrician, Cray went to university on the GI Bill and

01:08.720 --> 01:13.360
graduated from the University of Minnesota with a bachelor's in electrical engineering

01:13.360 --> 01:14.960
and a master's in applied math.

01:15.840 --> 01:20.240
Then in 1950 he joined a small company called Engineering Research Associates,

01:20.240 --> 01:22.880
or ERA, in St. Paul, Minnesota.

01:23.120 --> 01:28.320
During World War II, the U.S. Navy employed a team of elite code breakers.

01:29.120 --> 01:34.080
This division was known as the Communication Supplementary Activity Washington, or CESA,

01:34.640 --> 01:39.120
and in secret they designed and built powerful machines to break access naval codes,

01:39.120 --> 01:40.880
mostly to find German submarines.

01:41.920 --> 01:46.400
At the war's end, people realized that the U.S. government still needed to break codes,

01:46.400 --> 01:50.800
Soviet codes this time, but with budget cuts they cannot afford to keep their employees.

01:51.600 --> 01:55.040
So the Navy worked with an investment banker named John Parker

01:55.040 --> 01:58.800
to set up a for-profit company that would hire and employ the old team

01:58.800 --> 02:00.080
at higher salaries.

02:00.080 --> 02:01.120
This was ERA.

02:02.240 --> 02:06.800
ERA's people worked largely in secret out of an old glider factory.

02:06.800 --> 02:09.760
Their first products were code-breaking machines like before,

02:10.720 --> 02:14.960
but the team quickly began moving towards useful general-purpose computers,

02:14.960 --> 02:18.160
leveraging emerging technologies like magnetic drum memory.

02:18.960 --> 02:22.320
One of the first such products was the ERA1101.

02:22.320 --> 02:27.600
The computer was a commercialized version of a device sold to one of the precursors of the NSA.

02:28.560 --> 02:33.520
You can say that Minnesota in the 1950s was Silicon Valley before Silicon Valley existed.

02:34.160 --> 02:38.640
Thanks to the strong military presence, it was America's premier computing center.

02:40.720 --> 02:44.800
Despite being just 25 years old, Cray showed himself to be a talented worker.

02:45.440 --> 02:50.080
Cray was quiet, but had the unshakable confidence to speak up when something was wrong.

02:50.640 --> 02:54.800
He had incredible focus and rigid discipline, and of course he was brilliant,

02:54.800 --> 02:57.680
with a gift for understanding the world of binary numbers.

02:58.560 --> 03:02.960
Thus, Cray was challenged to produce the control system for ERA's next computer,

03:02.960 --> 03:04.480
the ERA1103.

03:05.120 --> 03:09.840
The control system breaks down the software's instructions into execution steps.

03:10.640 --> 03:14.880
Control system design required front-to-back knowledge of the computer's guts

03:14.880 --> 03:19.360
because it had to coordinate all those resources to efficiently execute the program.

03:20.000 --> 03:23.760
Cray did the work and quickly rose up the ranks to supervise the team.

03:24.960 --> 03:28.080
Like another legend of the times on Wong of Wong Labs,

03:28.080 --> 03:31.520
Seymour Cray's genius can make him sometimes difficult to work for.

03:32.080 --> 03:36.080
Cray preferred to work alone, spending late nights in the workshop.

03:36.080 --> 03:39.520
If someone wasn't doing it right or was taking too long,

03:39.520 --> 03:41.760
he reassigned them and did it himself.

03:42.320 --> 03:44.000
They called it being scrayed.

03:44.800 --> 03:48.560
But despite being very quiet, Seymour treated his colleagues well

03:48.560 --> 03:51.120
and was generally liked and respected.

03:51.120 --> 03:56.400
Just a big eccentric and enigmatic, exactly as a genius computer designer should be.

03:58.080 --> 04:02.320
In December 1951, President and original investor John Parker

04:02.320 --> 04:05.200
sold ERA to the computer company, Remington Rand.

04:06.080 --> 04:09.440
Parker didn't tell the employees that ERA about this

04:09.440 --> 04:12.160
which in bird culture is considered a dick move.

04:12.880 --> 04:15.680
And an angered key workers like William Norris

04:15.680 --> 04:18.960
who joined early and rose to become VP of operations.

04:20.080 --> 04:23.280
Remington Rand was a typewriter and shaver company.

04:23.280 --> 04:24.160
Why computers?

04:24.800 --> 04:28.880
Even more strangely, Rand had already bought a computer company earlier,

04:28.880 --> 04:31.200
the Eckhart Mockley Computer Corporation.

04:32.160 --> 04:36.720
Jay Presper Eckhart and John Mockley will forever be known for making ENIAC,

04:36.720 --> 04:38.720
the first programmable digital computer.

04:39.520 --> 04:43.440
And then EDVAC, pioneering the stored program computer design

04:43.440 --> 04:46.320
that today underpins the von Neumann architecture.

04:47.200 --> 04:52.080
Along the way, Eckhart also created the first course on electronic digital computers,

04:52.080 --> 04:56.880
the Moore School Lectures, which helped popularize the von Neumann architecture.

04:56.880 --> 04:58.320
No relation to Moore's law.

04:59.120 --> 05:02.880
And then UNIVAC won, a computer that Garnard renowned for predicting

05:02.880 --> 05:08.400
that some dude named Dwight Eisenhower would win the 1952 U.S. presidential election.

05:09.440 --> 05:13.040
The world famous Eckhart and Mockley had serious computer credentials,

05:13.040 --> 05:16.080
so the guys at ERA accepted the arrangement.

05:16.080 --> 05:19.520
Eckhart Mockley would focus on the business computer marketplace

05:19.520 --> 05:22.240
while ERA focused on scientific computing.

05:23.120 --> 05:24.560
But tensions remained.

05:24.560 --> 05:27.680
Today the computing needs of both business and science

05:27.680 --> 05:30.320
can be handled by a general purpose computer,

05:30.320 --> 05:33.120
but in those days the computers had to be more specific.

05:34.400 --> 05:37.760
Computers for business did simple operations,

05:37.760 --> 05:42.640
adding, subtracting, and multiplying, and with only two decimal points of accuracy.

05:43.200 --> 05:46.480
However, this had to be done at large scale,

05:46.480 --> 05:49.120
thousands of rows going in and out of the computer.

05:50.400 --> 05:54.800
Scientific computing was different in that it required complex calculations

05:54.800 --> 05:57.680
with up to 20 to 30 decimal points of accuracy.

05:58.320 --> 06:03.520
Such a computer might munch on a problem for hours just to produce a single line of output.

06:04.480 --> 06:06.960
The guys at Eckhart Mockley in Philadelphia

06:06.960 --> 06:10.320
looked down on the Minnesota guys as mere quote-unquote farmers

06:10.320 --> 06:12.240
who did not work on the state of the art,

06:12.800 --> 06:16.400
and the Minnesota guys saw the Philadelphians as theoreticians

06:16.400 --> 06:19.200
who only cared about making computers faster,

06:19.200 --> 06:21.440
even if it meant them breaking down a lot.

06:22.720 --> 06:29.520
Things got worse in 1955 when Rand merged with the Sperry Corporation to become Sperry Rand.

06:29.680 --> 06:35.360
The merger forced together the two formerly independent units into one Unifact division.

06:36.400 --> 06:41.840
The tensions really flared between ERA, Eckhart, and their new corporate overlords.

06:41.840 --> 06:43.600
The aforementioned William Norris,

06:43.600 --> 06:47.360
the division's new general manager, said to the Philadelphia guys,

06:47.360 --> 06:51.360
you people run a laboratory, and ERA runs a business.

06:52.560 --> 06:57.120
When Sperry took over its top management, including President Harry Vickers,

06:57.120 --> 07:01.200
thought that they were buying a market leader. That was not the case.

07:01.200 --> 07:05.280
Unifact had the potential to be what IBM eventually became,

07:05.280 --> 07:10.080
but it needed the capital to get there. Not only in R&D to build the machines,

07:10.080 --> 07:14.720
but also because computers were an equipment leasing business back then.

07:14.720 --> 07:16.400
It was very capital intensive.

07:17.440 --> 07:23.440
In 1957, enough was enough. Norris left Sperry Rand to found a new company,

07:23.440 --> 07:28.720
Control Data Corporation, or CDC. A new company was a huge risk,

07:28.720 --> 07:32.480
but Norris figured that if it did not work, then he and his family

07:32.480 --> 07:34.640
could go back to their farm in Nebraska.

07:35.600 --> 07:38.720
Norris invited a few of his ERA co-workers to come with him.

07:39.280 --> 07:43.520
Cray was one of those who accepted, having seen the writing on the wall when he noticed

07:43.520 --> 07:49.360
an accounting system categorize his project as 999, miscellaneous, and other.

07:50.320 --> 07:58.080
CDC started in July 1957 with its employees, a vague idea to make computers and some money from

07:58.080 --> 08:05.920
friends. No plant, no product, and little money. To get the company off the ground, CDC IPO'd.

08:05.920 --> 08:10.720
Like literally, they stood on the street and sold shares to ordinary members of the public

08:10.720 --> 08:14.160
for a dollar each. This is probably not possible today.

08:15.120 --> 08:18.960
The company got its first splash of publicity from an unexpected spot.

08:19.600 --> 08:24.800
Sid Hartman, a sports columnist at the Minneapolis Tribune and former part-time

08:24.800 --> 08:27.120
general manager of the Minneapolis Lakers, what?

08:27.760 --> 08:30.560
Mentioned the move at the end of one of his sports column.

08:31.520 --> 08:35.440
Many prominent local investors declined an investment in CDC,

08:35.440 --> 08:40.720
one saying that they, quote, didn't have a ghost of a chance, end quote, against IBM.

08:41.680 --> 08:47.200
Decliners included a guy named Warren Buffett. Despite being William Norris' nephew by marriage,

08:47.200 --> 08:52.320
he declined due to a lack of understanding, but he's poor now and deeply regrets that.

08:53.280 --> 08:57.440
Years later, the $1 shares would be worth about many times that.

08:57.440 --> 09:03.440
The early CDC IPO enriched the company's 300 initial investors and created a generation

09:03.440 --> 09:05.360
of new wealth in the Minnesota area.

09:06.000 --> 09:11.520
Craig was the most technical person at the new company and persuaded his co-founders to

09:11.520 --> 09:17.280
build scientific computers rather than going to the commercial market. His reasoning was that

09:17.280 --> 09:22.800
their clientele universities and nuclear weapons research labs cared less about marketing and

09:22.800 --> 09:29.200
client service and they programmed their own software. What they wanted was compute, serious

09:29.200 --> 09:35.120
compute. Due to treaty obligations, you can't just test fire a nuclear weapon and even discounting

09:35.120 --> 09:41.920
the environmental issues cannot easily measure its workings. So to study a detonation, we needed

09:41.920 --> 09:48.400
computers to simulate the bomb's chain reactions, stepping through all the equations every microsecond

09:48.400 --> 09:53.600
after detonation. That means the biggest and fastest computers on the market.

09:54.480 --> 09:59.760
Craig was convinced that he could build such a computer at a relatively bearable cost using

09:59.840 --> 10:05.120
transistors. He went down to the local electronics shop and found that they were selling reject

10:05.120 --> 10:09.680
bipolar transistors for radios for cheaper than what you can get from the factory.

10:10.560 --> 10:17.040
These reject transistors suck outputting a weak signal. So Craig paired them up in what is called

10:17.040 --> 10:23.120
a Darlington pair with the second transistor amplifying the output of the first. The experience

10:23.120 --> 10:28.560
taught him that with the right design, you can use substandard components and still achieve the goal.

10:29.760 --> 10:34.720
Over a year into the venture with money running low, Bill Norris strikes a deal with the US Navy

10:34.720 --> 10:42.320
for what would be called the CDC-1604 computer in 1958. But now they have to build it at scale,

10:42.320 --> 10:47.440
buying a factory and hiring more engineers. Norris and other managers cut their salaries

10:47.440 --> 10:53.040
in half to save money. Engineers resorted to swiping transistor companies as free-sales

10:53.040 --> 11:00.640
samples for their computer. The CDC-1604 first hit the market in 1960, carrying a price tag of

11:00.640 --> 11:09.440
$990,000 or about $10.4 million today. At 0.2 MHz, it was the most powerful commercially available

11:09.440 --> 11:17.040
computer of the time, a supercomputer. A supercomputer is a bit of a squishy term. It's about pushing

11:17.040 --> 11:21.760
the envelope and computing, bringing out a computer that leads all others in its field.

11:22.400 --> 11:27.120
Control data was not alone in the market of producing super-fast computers for niche customers.

11:27.840 --> 11:34.400
Univac released the Livermore Automatic Reaction Calculator, LARC, in 1960, the same year as the

11:34.400 --> 11:40.640
1604's release. It helped Edward Teller do simulations for the hydrogen bomb and was the most

11:40.640 --> 11:48.000
powerful computer in the world from 1960 to 1961. The LARC scared IBM so much that they built the

11:48.000 --> 11:55.120
IBM-7030 stretch supercomputer designed by the legendary Gene Amdahl. The 7030 took back the

11:55.120 --> 12:02.080
crown of the world's most powerful supercomputer and retained it until 1964. But the LARC and

12:02.080 --> 12:09.200
Stretch were basically made to order products. Univac only made two LARC units. Control data

12:09.200 --> 12:13.680
turned the supercomputer into a category, a commercially successful one at that.

12:14.320 --> 12:20.000
The 1604 sold to the University of Illinois, Lockheed, the State of Israel, and more.

12:20.800 --> 12:26.080
The company began to turn a profit, challenging the old computer giants like Rand and IBM.

12:26.720 --> 12:33.120
CDC stock went from $1 to $9, and now Norris had to keep the engineers from selling their stock

12:33.120 --> 12:41.520
too early. After the 1604, Cray and CDC debated about how to proceed. Follow up on the 1604

12:41.520 --> 12:46.560
and finally attack the lucrative business data processing market. This would mean iterating

12:46.560 --> 12:53.840
on the 1604 architecture, making smaller computers like the CDC 160A a very good and successful

12:53.840 --> 13:00.320
control applications computer. But Cray only wanted to build the fastest possible machine.

13:00.320 --> 13:05.600
The scientific community had only started to realize a new form of computational modeling,

13:05.600 --> 13:09.040
finite element analysis, which I mentioned in a prior video.

13:10.080 --> 13:15.120
Finite element analysis involves splitting something down into millions of simpler elements

13:15.120 --> 13:21.200
and running simulations based on how those elements might act. For instance, breaking a car down into

13:21.200 --> 13:27.360
tiny shapes and using that to predict how it might survive a car crash. With finite element analysis,

13:27.360 --> 13:32.000
the more steps you can break something down into, the better you can model and predict

13:32.000 --> 13:38.480
complex systems like the weather or nuclear explosions. This basically implied an infinite

13:38.480 --> 13:45.600
need for compute. Cray wanted to be the guy to feed that need for speed. He threatened to

13:45.600 --> 13:50.720
leave the company over this issue, which caused Norris to eventually agree on splitting the two

13:50.720 --> 13:58.240
teams. One CDC team would work on a 1604 follow up. Meanwhile, the 35 year old Cray and his team

13:58.320 --> 14:04.160
were allowed to open their own lab in Cray's hometown of Chippewa Falls, Wisconsin. This new

14:04.160 --> 14:09.520
lab was just a brief stroll from his house. There, Cray and his team worked on a machine

14:09.520 --> 14:18.000
some 15 times faster than the 1604, named the 6600. When Cray and his team sat down to make

14:18.000 --> 14:25.680
the CDC 6600, they started off with something like the 1604. The 1604 was built with ferrite

14:25.680 --> 14:31.920
magnetic cores for main memory and magnetic tape for secondary storage. For compute, it had

14:31.920 --> 14:37.120
germanium transistors. Everything was built inside air-cooled, pluggable building blocks.

14:38.000 --> 14:44.880
But as they worked on the 6600, Cray changed many things. Critically, he saw silicon planar

14:44.880 --> 14:49.520
transistors from Fairchild. They switched far faster than germanium transistors,

14:50.080 --> 14:57.120
automatically granting a 5x speed boost. The rest of the 10-15x speed up goal, though,

14:57.120 --> 15:02.720
had to come from somewhere else. Cray soon soured on the building block approach. Each

15:02.720 --> 15:08.640
block had extensive back panel wiring, which not only caused noise issues but also limited input

15:08.640 --> 15:14.960
output and increased how long it took to transmit data. So Cray threw it all out and switched to

15:15.040 --> 15:21.920
using denser, more complex custom modules called cordwood modules. The shorter wires improved

15:21.920 --> 15:27.520
speed but also made it difficult to repair and necessitated the replacement of air cooling

15:27.520 --> 15:34.080
with freon gas cooling. Another concept they implemented was parallelism. Every system has

15:34.080 --> 15:40.160
to do housekeeping functions or the such in addition to the main compute task. Why should the main

15:40.160 --> 15:48.000
processor have to do that? Offloaded to something else. The 6600 contained 11 individual computers

15:48.000 --> 15:52.560
that can execute programs separately from each other. They only shared a central memory.

15:53.120 --> 15:58.320
10 of the computers handled secondary work like peripherals leaving the 11th computer free to

15:58.320 --> 16:05.920
do nothing but high speed math. Additionally, the 6600 lived and breathed simplicity. A computer

16:05.920 --> 16:12.560
CPU uses something called an instruction set architecture or ISA to define its basic operations

16:12.560 --> 16:20.640
thus also defining how software can control it. The 6600 simplified its ISA ditching everything

16:20.640 --> 16:26.960
unrelated to scientific computing like for instance instructions for handling large amounts of data

16:26.960 --> 16:33.040
something more geared for commercial users. This simplified instruction set allowed the computer

16:33.040 --> 16:39.040
to quote quote pipeline tasks breaking down a bigger job to smaller ones that can be assigned

16:39.040 --> 16:46.960
to peripheral computers to work on simultaneously. CDC delivered its first 6600 to Lawrence Livermore

16:46.960 --> 16:55.360
in 1964. The machine's incredible speed three times faster than the 7030 shocked IBM. Chairman

16:55.360 --> 17:02.000
Thomas J. Watson Jr. wrote a scathing memo asking how quote 34 people including the janitor and quote

17:02.560 --> 17:08.320
beat the biggest technology company in the world. The answer of course was that IBM's architects

17:08.320 --> 17:15.280
could not bear to sacrifice compatibility for speed. The splitting of the teams within control

17:15.280 --> 17:21.280
data prevented a blow up but discontent continued to faster. Norris and other managers continued

17:21.280 --> 17:27.040
to build up the business. CDC began making its own peripherals and software to accompany the main

17:27.120 --> 17:33.440
computer building a services business. Control data also purchased a consumer finance company

17:33.440 --> 17:39.840
commercial credit intending to use their 3.4 billion dollars of working capital to fund its

17:39.840 --> 17:46.240
computer leasing strategy. This strategy which seemed smart at the time eventually backfired

17:46.240 --> 17:53.840
when commercial credit ran into difficulties. Over 100 CDC 6600s were sold to big customers

17:53.840 --> 17:59.280
like the atomic energy commission but each cost 8 million dollars or about 23 million today.

17:59.920 --> 18:04.720
As you might think it limited the market to about 50 total customers in the world.

18:05.760 --> 18:11.440
But Seymour Cray felt this was a feature not a bug. He loved knowing the first names of each

18:11.440 --> 18:16.880
of his customers. The control data's management was increasingly coming to the belief that

18:16.880 --> 18:24.000
peripherals and services not hardware were the company's future. Control data followed up the

18:24.000 --> 18:31.280
CDC 6600 with the 7600 and it was hailed as the world's fastest computer five times faster than

18:31.280 --> 18:37.680
the 6600. But despite costing only twice as much of its predecessor it sold poorly in part due to

18:37.680 --> 18:45.120
frequent breakdowns and a weak economy. Then after that we had the 8600. This supercomputer was made

18:45.120 --> 18:51.840
with regular discrete transistors but Cray wanted a clock cycle time of 8 nanoseconds which meant

18:51.840 --> 18:57.360
every wire had to be shorter than 2.5 meters squeezing those parts very close together.

18:58.480 --> 19:03.440
Things got so dense that Cray couldn't figure out how to sufficiently cool them.

19:03.440 --> 19:09.120
After many months he decided to throw everything out and start again from scratch. It was his style

19:09.120 --> 19:16.480
the Cray way. But this was 1971 and control data was in the midst of an expensive antitrust lawsuit

19:16.480 --> 19:23.920
against IBM. Cash flow was running low. Cray was asked to cut expenses by 10% unwilling to do that

19:23.920 --> 19:31.200
he cut his own salary to minimum wage or $1.25 an hour. This did not solve the issue and in the

19:31.200 --> 19:37.440
end Norris told Cray that a redo like before could not be done. They already pre-sold two 8600

19:37.440 --> 19:45.920
systems and in 1972 Cray decided to leave and start his own shop Cray Research. Seymour Cray

19:45.920 --> 19:52.560
founded Cray Research with $2.5 million, 20% of which was his own money and a bunch of bank loans.

19:53.120 --> 19:58.400
The company's goal was to build the biggest computer one at a time like a master artisan.

19:58.400 --> 20:03.520
It did not care for big revenues nor did it expect them. The focus was on research rather

20:03.520 --> 20:10.240
than manufacture like Star Trek plumbing the outer limits of possibility. In a show of goodwill

20:10.240 --> 20:15.600
Norris and control data arranged a luncheon to say goodbye and invested a quarter million dollars in

20:15.600 --> 20:22.560
the new company. Norris called it heart money. For his first computer the Cray one Seymour Cray

20:22.560 --> 20:29.120
wanted revolutionary performance to get it he decided to turn to a new concept vector processing.

20:30.080 --> 20:36.160
Most CPUs of the time used scalar processing meaning the process single data items like integers

20:36.160 --> 20:42.800
or floating point numbers one at a time. So imagine the job of adding one in one a scalar

20:42.800 --> 20:48.960
CPU would load the first one into its register from memory load the second one add them and then

20:48.960 --> 20:55.200
store the result into memory counted up this job used four instructions. So if we are summing up

20:55.200 --> 21:02.560
two sets of 20 numbers that is 80 instructions that a scalar CPU has to handle a vector processing

21:02.560 --> 21:08.000
machine shortcuts that by processing single dimension arrays of data vectors. So if we

21:08.000 --> 21:13.200
have those two vectors containing 20 numbers each loading the two vectors into the register

21:13.200 --> 21:19.200
adding them and storing the result vector into memory that only uses four instructions rather

21:19.200 --> 21:25.360
than 80. Control data knew about vector processing too they had a small team working on a vector

21:25.360 --> 21:30.800
computer called the star 100 but the star was tremendously complicated and failed to live

21:30.800 --> 21:35.920
up to its promises. Control data shipped it four years late and sold only three of them.

21:36.960 --> 21:43.120
Cray studied the star 100 and realized its flaws first its scalar processing was slow

21:43.120 --> 21:48.880
bottlenecking the overall system performance and second the computer's vector processing

21:48.880 --> 21:54.640
implementation had a hitch recall my example from before before you can run the addition

21:54.640 --> 22:00.000
operation on the two vectors you first have to load them both into the register same with

22:00.000 --> 22:05.520
sending results back to memory. The problem was that this was taking too long doesn't

22:05.520 --> 22:10.640
matter how much faster vector processing is compared to scalar processing if handling the

22:10.640 --> 22:16.960
vectors took forever. So Cray introduced vector registers very fast intermediate memory systems

22:16.960 --> 22:23.040
that work like cache memory to improve speed. Seymour also decided to adopt integrated circuits

22:23.040 --> 22:28.560
for the first time this allowed for more density and cut down on wiring allowing the Cray one to

22:28.560 --> 22:35.600
be far smaller than its predecessors. By then ICs were roughly about 14 years old and quite mature

22:35.600 --> 22:41.040
but reflects Cray's approach of choosing older technologies quote a decade behind end quote as

22:41.040 --> 22:47.520
he'd like to say so that they are more reliable but when it came to memory Cray could not compromise

22:47.520 --> 22:52.000
he broke his principle and bought bipolar semiconductor memory chips to replace the

22:52.000 --> 22:59.280
old core memories it cost less had more density and eight less power. The computer's clock cycle

22:59.280 --> 23:06.080
of 12.5 nanoseconds made it five times faster than the CDC 7600 so every wire in the machine had to

23:06.080 --> 23:12.720
be less than four feet long and of course you can't forget its iconic look a circular shape to

23:12.720 --> 23:17.520
accommodate the new cooling scheme but with an added bit of flair to differentiate from the

23:17.520 --> 23:24.560
boring gray boxes of the era and it had cushions too. The Cray one made a huge stir upon its release

23:24.560 --> 23:30.720
in 1976 with its flashy look and world-beating speed. A hundred Cray ones were sold to various

23:30.720 --> 23:36.000
government and university lab customers like the National Center for Atmospheric Research

23:36.000 --> 23:44.240
and the Department of Defense. It generated 150 revenue growth for Cray research from 1978 to 1979

23:44.240 --> 23:50.480
with another 50 growth a year after that. The orders came in so fast one a month which is a lot

23:50.480 --> 23:56.560
for eight million dollar product that a big backlog developed. IBM did not even try to compete

23:57.200 --> 24:03.200
Cray's former employer control data found itself thrown off its feet they tried producing vector

24:03.200 --> 24:10.960
computers like the cyber 205 but they had gotten bloated and complicated unable to keep up. The

24:10.960 --> 24:15.440
company suffered large financial losses and eventually sold itself off in pieces by the

24:15.440 --> 24:22.320
mid 1980s CDC's most profitable business was Ticketron a rival to the widely despised Ticketmaster.

24:24.000 --> 24:28.720
As I said Seymour Cray wanted to build the fastest computer and to build it from a clean

24:28.720 --> 24:35.040
piece of paper. Even as the Cray one was in the late stages of development Seymour started to shift

24:35.040 --> 24:41.680
his gaze towards a machine even more ambitious the Cray two with a clock speed some three to six

24:41.760 --> 24:48.320
times faster than its predecessor. Such a machine had obstacles with that clock speed no wire can

24:48.320 --> 24:53.600
be longer than 40 centimeters again bringing back the same heating challenges Cray faced with the

24:53.600 --> 25:00.960
8600 and to his dismay Seymour could not focus on solving these problems because his business needed

25:00.960 --> 25:06.640
him to fund early development Cray research IPO did stock which brought on a whole load of new

25:06.640 --> 25:13.680
responsibilities and a bit poetically the company's success caused new headaches since each Cray one

25:13.680 --> 25:19.760
was hand-wired and custom-made like some limited edition supercar a process that took a year the

25:19.760 --> 25:27.040
company had no choice but to staff up to deliver on his big backlog from 1978 to 1980 the company

25:27.040 --> 25:35.040
grew from 300 to 500 people rapid growth and at its peak Cray research employed over 5000 people

25:35.040 --> 25:41.280
in the tiny town of Chippewa Falls Wisconsin Seymour originally pursued scientific computing

25:41.280 --> 25:47.840
because users wrote their own hardware it let him just focus on hardware but times had changed

25:47.840 --> 25:53.920
customers no longer had the budget to rewrite their software every time they wanted portability

25:53.920 --> 26:00.080
it is why the Unix operating system got to be so popular so Cray's customers were increasingly

26:00.080 --> 26:05.600
interested in getting a better Cray one than a radically different Cray two which would require

26:05.600 --> 26:14.000
them to redo all their software it was the story of control data in the 1604 all over again eventually

26:14.000 --> 26:20.400
Cray research's management including CEO John Rohlwagen did the dual approach once more on one

26:20.400 --> 26:26.320
side they extended the Cray one line with the 1s still a powerful computer but not radically different

26:26.320 --> 26:32.640
like a Cray two might be meanwhile Seymour Cray stepped down as chairman in 1981 handing that

26:32.640 --> 26:37.680
job over to the CEO Rohlwagen and became an independent contractor so that he could work on

26:37.680 --> 26:44.400
the Cray two he moved to Boulder Colorado to work in peace once more the Cray two eventually did

26:44.400 --> 26:51.040
come out in 1985 after three false starts on the cooling system famously had this massive liquid

26:51.040 --> 26:56.640
immersion cooling system that caused the machine to resemble an aquarium even so memory latency

26:56.640 --> 27:02.960
caused the system to underperform its full potential then to the surprise of many Seymour's Cray two

27:02.960 --> 27:10.000
found itself upstaged by another computer produced by a separate team the Cray XMP supercomputer the

27:10.000 --> 27:15.920
XMP team was led by a longtime Cray collaborator named Les Davis as well as a talented young

27:15.920 --> 27:22.800
Taiwanese-American designer named Steve Chen where the Cray one had a single CPU the XMP

27:22.800 --> 27:29.120
introduced parallel processing with four CPUs along with new solid state storage semiconductors

27:29.680 --> 27:36.320
released in 1983 the XMP was the world's fastest supercomputer two to five times faster than the

27:36.320 --> 27:43.840
1s without the radical design changes of the Cray two people were stunned it sold very well compared

27:43.840 --> 27:50.880
to the Cray two by 1989 there were only 24 units of the Cray two sold as compared to the almost 200

27:50.880 --> 27:59.120
units sold of the XMP and its immediate successor the YMP there were other changes in the 1970s Cray

27:59.120 --> 28:04.320
had no competitors for its unique part of the market but throughout the 1980s new supercomputer

28:04.320 --> 28:12.000
competitors started to emerge out of the woodwork first over in Japan where Fujitsu Hitachi and NEC

28:12.000 --> 28:16.960
leveraged Japan's growing advantages in VLSI semiconductor production to make compelling

28:16.960 --> 28:23.120
supercomputers Cray still dominated the market in 1988 they had 56 percent market share of

28:23.120 --> 28:28.720
traditional supercomputers but the Japanese all together had 37 percent and were making ground

28:29.840 --> 28:35.120
in a similar vein supercomputer startups like Thinking Machines and N-Cube began exploring

28:35.120 --> 28:39.840
new approaches of supercomputing beyond just vector computing the most prominent of which are

28:39.840 --> 28:46.640
massively parallel systems or MPPs these systems coordinate many commercial microprocessors to do

28:46.640 --> 28:52.240
millions or even billions of floating point operations each second these microprocessors

28:52.240 --> 28:58.640
being bought off the shelf meant far better price for performance this combined competition from the

28:58.640 --> 29:04.400
startups the Japanese and even old friends like control data supercomputer spin-off ETA systems

29:04.400 --> 29:08.720
put a lot of pressure on Cray to focus this approach and its product lineup

29:09.600 --> 29:15.440
Cray researchers unexpected success with the XMP would come back to haunted designer Steve Chen

29:15.440 --> 29:20.800
was featured as one of the company's young exciting rising talents the next Seymour Cray even

29:20.800 --> 29:26.320
but unfortunately the aggressive vision that Chen and his team had for the MP line after the YMP

29:26.320 --> 29:33.360
spiraled beyond what the company can financially support 64 processors custom integrated circuits

29:33.360 --> 29:39.600
and maybe even optical interconnects in 1987 the company was already invested in developing

29:39.600 --> 29:45.920
Seymour Cray's next machine the Cray 3 and the YMP in addition to three existing products that needed

29:45.920 --> 29:52.800
money too they had no money for Chen's science fiction dream so that year Cray research scaled

29:52.800 --> 29:58.320
back the MP line of computers in response the much heralded Steve Chen quit Cray research

29:58.400 --> 30:04.560
and started his own company Supercomputer Systems Supercomputer Systems took 150 million

30:04.560 --> 30:10.160
dollars of investment money from IBM and other investors like Ford and Boeing but went bankrupt

30:10.160 --> 30:17.760
in 1993 in 1989 the company could no longer accommodate its former founder Seymour Cray

30:17.760 --> 30:24.240
joined a spin-off called Cray Computer Corporation or CCC in Colorado to work on the future Cray 3

30:24.960 --> 30:31.360
Cray research thusly would go onwards with the existing Cray XMP architecture building the ecosystem

30:32.320 --> 30:36.720
the Cray 3 would have used gallium arsenide semiconductors for switching performance far

30:36.720 --> 30:42.000
faster than what was possible with silicon it necessitated buying a lot of chip making equipment

30:42.880 --> 30:49.200
the Cray 3 soon fell behind and in 1991 various customers started canceling their orders because

30:49.200 --> 30:55.520
of cratering defense demand after the fall of the Soviet Union CCC would only sell one system

30:55.520 --> 31:02.720
before filing for bankruptcy in 1995 and announced Cray 4 never materialized either Seymour Cray's

31:02.720 --> 31:08.560
cherished approach of sitting down with a clean sheet of paper and building a big iron supercomputer

31:08.560 --> 31:16.000
was no longer financially viable Seymour Cray formed a new company SRC computers to begin exploring

31:16.000 --> 31:23.360
parallel designs but he then passed away in 1996 at the age of 71 due to injuries from a car accident

31:24.560 --> 31:28.960
Cray research was eventually sold to Silicon Graphics and it bounced around for a while

31:28.960 --> 31:32.640
but is now part of Hewlett Packard Enterprise as just Cray Inc.

31:34.560 --> 31:39.680
Advancing semiconductor technologies have made the supercomputers of the past seem comically behind

31:40.400 --> 31:45.600
in 2010 an electrical engineer named Chris Fenton did a project to emulate the Cray 1a

31:45.600 --> 31:52.480
supercomputer using a Xilinx Spartan 3e 1600 development board he even put it into a cute

31:52.480 --> 31:58.400
little Cray 1 package and it now sits in the computer history museum where it inspired this video

31:59.520 --> 32:04.960
today's leading edge semiconductor makers now face the same issues as Cray did with his supercomputers

32:05.040 --> 32:10.480
thermal problems interconnect problems slowdowns due to memory retrieval I am struck

32:10.480 --> 32:16.240
by the similarities unfortunately the semiconductor industry cannot do as Seymour did

32:16.240 --> 32:21.760
throw it all out and start anew with a fresh sheet of paper all right everyone that's it for

32:21.760 --> 32:28.000
