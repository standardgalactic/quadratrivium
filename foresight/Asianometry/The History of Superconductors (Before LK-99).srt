00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,800
On July 22nd, 2023, a paper was posted claiming the creation of a Room Temperature Ambient

2
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:12,800
Pressure Superconductor LK-99.

3
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:17,440
The world is now trying to synthesize the thing and replicate the paper's findings,

4
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:21,440
the LK-99 Wikipedia page is keeping a running tally.

5
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:26,080
The quest for a room temperature superconductor has gone on for over a century.

6
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:29,720
It has seen some amazing highs and lows.

7
00:00:29,720 --> 00:00:35,080
In this video, let us dive into the dream and track the 100-year history of technological

8
00:00:35,080 --> 00:00:39,240
progression towards this mythical substance.

9
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:41,620
But first, I want to remind you about the newsletter.

10
00:00:41,620 --> 00:00:46,040
Sign up for updates and new analysis, the full scripts of selected popular videos, and

11
00:00:46,040 --> 00:00:47,040
more.

12
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:48,880
The sign up link is in the video description below.

13
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:50,720
I try to put one out every week.

14
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:51,720
Maybe two.

15
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:54,240
Alright, back to the show.

16
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:58,080
Resistance is a material's opposition to an electric current flowing through it.

17
00:00:58,080 --> 00:01:03,760
A conductor has low resistance, and so let's electrons easily move through them, insulators

18
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:05,320
do not.

19
00:01:05,320 --> 00:01:09,360
In previous videos, I have mentioned that all real-world materials have some amount

20
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:10,640
of resistance.

21
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:15,600
Of course, I was not thinking about superconductors, perhaps because I didn't consider them practical

22
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:17,200
materials.

23
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:20,800
We have known about superconductivity for over a century now.

24
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:26,760
In 1911, the Dutch physicist and Nobel Prize winner Heike Kamerle Onnes and his students

25
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:32,560
started performing experiments at super-low temperatures using liquid helium.

26
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:37,080
At the time, people speculated on what might happen to the electrical resistance of metals

27
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:39,960
as they approached absolute zero.

28
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:45,600
Sir James DeWor, inventor of the vacuum flask, theorized that electrical resistance would

29
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:48,840
infinitesimally approach zero.

30
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:52,840
Lord Kelvin, on the other hand, thought that it would hit some minimum before quickly rising

31
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:57,680
towards infinity, his reasoning being that the electrons would stop moving as it gets

32
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:59,280
colder.

33
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:02,760
So Kamerle Onnes did an experiment with mercury.

34
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:03,760
Why mercury?

35
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:07,680
Because it was the only metal they had available in sufficient purity.

36
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:14,880
And unexpectedly, the experiment showed mercury's resistance falling to zero just below 4.2 Kelvin.

37
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:20,640
Kamerle Onnes named the state superconductivity, the temperature at which the material achieves

38
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:24,640
this state is called the transition temperature.

39
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:27,960
The first superconductors triggered a great deal of excitement.

40
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:33,400
It was the electrical engineer's wet dream, a future free of electrical resistance.

41
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:39,960
In 1913, Kamerle Onnes traveled to Chicago and spoke of building a helium cooling plant

42
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:46,640
in pursuit of smaller, more efficient motors or generators using superconductivity.

43
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:49,320
Optimistic Kamerle Onnes continued his work.

44
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:55,760
He discovered that lead's transition temperature was 7.2 Kelvin, slightly higher than mercury.

45
00:02:55,760 --> 00:03:01,600
In 1914, he then made a coil of lead wire, froze it to 7.2 Kelvin, and passed an electrical

46
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:03,120
current through it.

47
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:08,260
But to his disappointment, the coil lost all of its superconducting powers when the magnetic

48
00:03:08,260 --> 00:03:12,760
field got to be about as strong as a horseshoe magnet.

49
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:17,400
As it turns out, superconductivity requires not only a low enough temperature, but also

50
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:22,520
a low enough magnetic field and a low enough amount of current passing through it, current

51
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:23,800
density.

52
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:29,600
The material can only maintain their superconductivity if all three sit within the parameters.

53
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:35,240
Today, pure metal or simple alloy superconductors are known for this fundamental weakness.

54
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:37,940
These are not good for practical industrial use.

55
00:03:37,940 --> 00:03:43,040
After all, electrical systems encounter magnetic fields all the time.

56
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:45,480
Kamerle Onnes must have been crushed.

57
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:50,120
He was one of the first scientists to have fallen victim to the sirens of superconductivity.

58
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:53,680
He would not be the last.

59
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:57,000
Research on superconductor materials then slowed for a decade.

60
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:01,840
The need for liquid helium cooling stood as a formidable financial barrier to continued

61
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:03,480
commercialization.

62
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:06,960
And there was no big market need pushing for it either.

63
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:11,360
Many people worked on the concept simply because it fascinated them.

64
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:14,760
Through them, pioneering science was done in the 1930s.

65
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:22,520
We discovered three more superconductors, tantalum at 4.4K, thorium at 1.4K, and neobium,

66
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:28,120
which has the highest transition temperature yet known at 9.2 Kelvin.

67
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:31,160
In 1933, we discovered the Meisner effect.

68
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:36,720
This is where a superconductor expels all magnetic fields as it transitions into a superconducting

69
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:37,720
state.

70
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:42,120
In other words, the magnetic field will go around the superconductor material rather

71
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:43,920
than permeate through it.

72
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:49,360
This explains why all the videos you see of these things are of them floating on magnets.

73
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:53,040
And then a second major discovery that went under the radar.

74
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:59,360
In the late 1920s, the Soviet Ukrainian scientist Lev Shubnikov worked at a cryogenic lab in

75
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:00,560
the Netherlands.

76
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:05,000
In 1930, he returned to the Soviet Union and continued his research.

77
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:10,240
There, his experiments discovered what are now called type 2 superconductors.

78
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:14,760
These are quite different from the pure metal superconductors today called type 1.

79
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:18,240
That's so disappointed Kamerle Ones.

80
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:23,920
Type 1 superconductors fall back to normal behavior when they breach their magnetic limit.

81
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:29,040
But type 2 superconductors can display a mix of ordinary and superconducting properties

82
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:31,800
at certain magnetic limits.

83
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:37,120
So type 2s can potentially be made to be far more tolerant of higher magnetic fields than

84
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:38,480
type 1s.

85
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:42,360
These are almost always complicated alloys or compounds.

86
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:46,680
Sadly, Shubnikov never got to see the benefits of his work.

87
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:52,720
At the height of the Great Purge in 1937, the NKVD targeted him for his foreign connections.

88
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:56,280
They arrested him, accused him of espionage, and shot him.

89
00:05:56,280 --> 00:06:00,400
It would be many years before the rest of the superconductor community recognized and

90
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:05,560
capitalized on the significance of his work.

91
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:10,120
World War II had shown the entire world the economic and military value of turning sciences

92
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:12,120
into technologies.

93
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:17,320
Shortly before the war, MIT professor Samuel Collins invented the Collins Helium Liquifier

94
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:18,520
System.

95
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:24,000
Widely introduced after the war, the Collins made liquid helium more available for superconductor

96
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,640
research.

97
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:30,800
Yet the search for higher temperature superconductors, perhaps even a room temperature one, remained

98
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:32,120
quite difficult.

99
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:35,120
We did not have good theory to tell us where to look.

100
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:40,280
So most people started with metals with already low amounts of resistivity, copper, gold,

101
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:42,960
silver, so on.

102
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:48,280
In the early 1950s, a pair of scientists, B. T. Matthias and John Holm, took a different

103
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:49,280
approach.

104
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:53,600
They embarked on a systematic search via experimentation.

105
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:59,520
The two pioneered the method of finding superconductors via the Meisner effect, the superconductor's

106
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:02,520
tendency to expel magnetic fields.

107
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:07,640
They applied an extra magnetic field to a sample as it was being cooled and measured

108
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:10,800
whether it expelled that magnetic field.

109
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:15,800
Matthias and Holm systematically moved through the periodic table, eventually testing over

110
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:18,440
5,000 compounds.

111
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:22,480
This was how they discovered the A3B superconductors.

112
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:27,800
Three niobium atoms and one atom of either silicon, tin, or aluminum.

113
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:30,640
Yes, it's a terrible name.

114
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:37,520
Anyway, these would hold the record for the highest transition temperature, 23K, for 28

115
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:38,520
years.

116
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:44,080
Matthias eventually formulated the Matthias rules for finding a superconductor, which,

117
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:49,640
kind of like the pirate code, are more what you'd call guidelines than actual rules.

118
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:54,080
Rule number 6 was, stay away from theorists.

119
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:58,440
As you might expect, Matthias looked down on superconducting theory, calling them just

120
00:07:58,440 --> 00:07:59,960
descriptions.

121
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:05,040
But the physics world wanted a theory to help guide their way forward, and in 1957,

122
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:09,360
three scientists proposed a theory that did just that.

123
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:14,560
John Robert Schreifer, Leon Cooper, one of the namesakes of Sheldon Cooper, and John

124
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:16,080
Bardeen.

125
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:17,920
Recognize the name of that last guy?

126
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:23,720
Bardeen won his first Nobel Prize in physics as one of the three inventors of the transistor.

127
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:26,600
This theory won him his second.

128
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:31,080
The theory was named BCS, named after its three inventors.

129
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:35,040
BCS also stands for Bowl Championship Series.

130
00:08:35,040 --> 00:08:41,000
It was a system that helped select the matchups in top tier American football college divisions.

131
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:44,720
Cal hasn't won a football championship since before World War II, so I don't know why I

132
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:46,160
care to mention this.

133
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:47,840
Let's move on.

134
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:54,000
Anyway, BCS theory suggests that when a material enters a superconducting state, their electrons

135
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,280
pair up.

136
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:58,520
This is weird because normally they repel each other.

137
00:08:58,520 --> 00:09:04,040
But in that superconducting state, we have the influence of a new force called phonons.

138
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:09,200
Phonons are measurable, energized vibrations in the material's crystal lattice.

139
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:14,960
Thanks to attractive forces from these phonons, the electron pairs create a brand new form

140
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:17,480
called Cooper pairs.

141
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:22,840
Cooper pairs are exempt from the Pauli exclusion principle, which explains why two solid objects

142
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:28,600
can't be in the same place at the same time, and also why all matter does not simply collapse

143
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:33,040
into a single point despite everything being mostly empty space.

144
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:36,600
I think I asked my mom that once when I was a kid.

145
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:42,400
Thusly, Cooper pairs allow these electrons to act differently than they usually do, traveling

146
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:45,360
through the crystal lattice without resistance.

147
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:49,120
This part of the theory has generally held up over the years.

148
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:53,240
Cooper pairs are key to superconductivity.

149
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:58,080
The energy bond holding these Cooper pairs are quite weak, so they can be easily shaken

150
00:09:58,080 --> 00:09:59,840
apart by thermal energy.

151
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:07,400
Thus, BCS theory does a good job of explaining superconductivity at low temperatures.

152
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:12,960
Superconducting materials whose behavior is explainable by BCS theory are known as conventional

153
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:15,320
superconductors.

154
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:21,800
By 1960, we knew about 35 elements and 1,000 different alloys to have shown superconductivity

155
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:24,440
under certain conditions.

156
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:30,960
In 1961, scientists discovered a series of niobium-based alloys that retained their superconductivity

157
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:34,440
in the presence of a stronger magnetic field.

158
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:39,800
These were called high-field superconductors, and they theoretically allowed us to make large

159
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:45,480
superconducting wires that perform far better than traditional copper ones.

160
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:51,600
Such wires can produce very powerful magnetic fields using very little power.

161
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:56,760
High-field superconductors achieved the original dream of Camerling Ones many decades ago,

162
00:10:56,760 --> 00:11:03,680
but even so, it took the industry until early 1970 to reliably and viably produce superconducting

163
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:05,240
wire.

164
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:11,440
Such superconducting wires eventually became the widely accepted method for producing MRIs.

165
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:16,880
MRIs with superconducting wire remained the single biggest and most important commercial

166
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:21,800
use for superconductor materials.

167
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:27,320
In 1986, two researchers at an IBM lab in Zurich, Switzerland, were collaborating on

168
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:30,240
a study on superconductors.

169
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:35,720
Alex Muller was a senior research fellow at IBM who received the job basically as a

170
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:37,960
stopover before retirement.

171
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:42,440
He had gotten interested in the field after spending 20 months in New York.

172
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:48,120
There, he observed IBM's massive Josephson Computer Technology project.

173
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:53,480
That was a $300 million effort to build an ultra-fast computer based on superconducting

174
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:55,320
digital logic switches.

175
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:57,720
It ultimately failed.

176
00:11:57,720 --> 00:12:02,400
I will talk about Josephson and his learnings in a future video about superconducting circuits

177
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:04,600
and their computers.

178
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:10,560
Upon returning to Zurich in 1983, Muller recruited a colleague, Georg Bednorz, to look

179
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:13,520
for superconductors in oxides.

180
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:17,680
After a couple frustrating years searching around, they came across an article from a

181
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:24,440
team of French scientists describing metal-like electrical conductivity at a rather high temperature,

182
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:27,480
like 900 degrees Celsius high.

183
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:29,040
That was interesting.

184
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:33,200
Ceramics are traditionally known to be electrical insulators.

185
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:38,280
After further experiments, the duo produced a ceramic compound of barium, lanthanum, copper,

186
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:45,080
and oxygen that achieved superconductivity at 35 Kelvin, a legit breakthrough.

187
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:50,320
As is so often in the land of superconductors, this discovery came as a total surprise.

188
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:54,680
Bednorz and Muller first kept their results away from even their colleagues and their

189
00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:56,320
employer.

190
00:12:56,320 --> 00:13:01,280
They decided to first publish their results at a small but reputable German physics journal,

191
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:04,720
apparently because they personally knew its editor.

192
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:11,200
In April 1986, they submitted the paper, which was deliberately given a very disarming title,

193
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:17,420
possible high TC superconductivity in the BALACUO system.

194
00:13:17,420 --> 00:13:21,320
They chose this title because the two were not sure about their result.

195
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:25,640
For instance, the Meisner effect had not yet been measured in it.

196
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:31,240
After some time, the paper was finally published in September 1986, but rumors had been circulating

197
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:36,480
since July and they shook the scientific community like an earthquake.

198
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:42,720
Not only because ceramics, like I said before, were not seen to be good conductors, but also

199
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:48,120
Bednorz and Muller were seen as outsiders to the superconductor community working in

200
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:51,320
a backwater of the IBM research machine.

201
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:56,000
One prominent member of the community, jaded by false claims over the years, was tempted

202
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:00,560
to simply throw the paper away when he first saw it.

203
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:05,680
These new ceramics also violated the previously established rules of superconductors.

204
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:13,040
It did not follow the Matthias rules and not only that, it highlighted a hole in BCS theory.

205
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:20,000
By then, physicists had largely adopted BCS as a reasonably rigorous explanation of superconductivity

206
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:25,360
and because BCS only worked in low temperatures, superconductivity in general was regarded

207
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:29,040
as an exclusively low-temperature phenomenon.

208
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:34,440
This discovery heralded a new class of ceramic oxide superconductors with high transition

209
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:40,480
temperatures higher than ever before seen, referred to as high-temperature superconductors

210
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:42,880
or high-T.

211
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:46,160
Research teams around the world raced to replicate the results.

212
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:52,920
In late November 1986, some two months after publication, the Asahi Shinbon newspaper reported

213
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:59,360
that a team led by Shoji Tanaka of the University of Tokyo had successfully repeated the experiment

214
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:01,680
confirming the results.

215
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:07,000
A few weeks after that, Paul Chu of the University of Houston replicated the results.

216
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,840
Chu's results made the headlines.

217
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:14,080
More impressively, he believed that there were other materials out there with even higher

218
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:16,320
transition temperatures.

219
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:22,560
A race for new superconductors soon emerged with the big line being 77K, the temperature

220
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:24,720
of liquid nitrogen.

221
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:30,840
Various groups in Beijing, Tokyo and the US traded papers back and forth.

222
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:36,200
Then in January 1987, Dr. Chu discovered a superconductor with a transition temperature

223
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:41,640
above 90K, breaking the so-called liquid nitrogen barrier.

224
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:46,920
Chu held off publishing for as long as possible as he first tried to patent the material.

225
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:52,880
Finally, in February 1987, he announced his marvelous technical breakthrough.

226
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:58,520
This class of high-temperature superconductors is sometimes called one-two-three superconductors

227
00:15:58,520 --> 00:16:04,320
because they have one atom of yttrium, two atoms of barium, and three atoms of copper.

228
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:09,280
There is also some oxygen attached, but whatever it messes with the cool naming.

229
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:15,160
These things are also more generally referred to as YBCO superconductors, cuprate superconductors,

230
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:17,760
or rare earth cuprate superconductors.

231
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:21,120
Oh hey, more rare earth stuff.

232
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:23,880
Wonder who's the world leader in those?

233
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:28,440
Anyway, all cuprate superconductors share the same structure.

234
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:32,000
They are big layered compounds, kind of like cakes.

235
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:37,800
Layers of copper oxygen separated from one another by insulating oxide layers.

236
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:42,240
The superconductivity happens within those thin copper oxygen layers.

237
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:44,720
We aren't exactly sure how it works.

238
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:50,720
Cooper pairs are probably involved, but differently from how it is in BCS theory, making them

239
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:54,440
unconventional superconductors.

240
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:58,280
Cuprates broke the nitrogen barrier, which meant that we can use liquid nitrogen to cool

241
00:16:58,280 --> 00:17:02,320
them rather than liquid helium, which is what we used before.

242
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:04,760
This has significant cost benefits.

243
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:15,800
On March 15th, the American Physical Society held a special symposium on high-temperature

244
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:19,800
superconductors specifically to talk about the results.

245
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:24,840
Several thousand physicists gathered at the Hilton at what they now call the Woodstock

246
00:17:24,840 --> 00:17:26,560
of Physics.

247
00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:31,480
The highlight was a special evening session dedicated to the discovery held on Wednesday

248
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:33,600
night in the Hilton Grand Ballroom.

249
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:35,760
It was filled to the brink.

250
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:43,360
The session started out at 7pm and ended at around 3am, a magical eight hours long.

251
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:48,200
A gold rush was on for new materials based on this breakthrough.

252
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:52,000
Superconductor-related headlines hit the media like the New York Times.

253
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:58,120
Businessweek cried out, superconductors, more important than the light bulb and the transistor.

254
00:17:58,120 --> 00:18:00,120
The fever swept over Japan.

255
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:05,240
Multiple ministries rapidly directed R&D spending into this new category.

256
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:12,120
By 1988, Mindy's single biggest R&D expenditure was on high-temperature superconductors.

257
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:19,480
The US, too, the White House even held a presidential conference on superconductivity in July 1987.

258
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:25,120
Reagan proposed an 11-point plan to build new industries around this new technology.

259
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:30,880
Tens of millions of dollars of federal R&D were funneled into superconductors.

260
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:34,860
On the corporate front, IBM and Bell Labs faced off with one another.

261
00:18:34,860 --> 00:18:39,080
They joined the fray alongside a bunch of new startups with buzzy names like American

262
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:45,520
Superconductor Corporation, Conductus, Illinois Superconductor Incorporated, and Superconducting

263
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:48,280
Technologies Incorporated.

264
00:18:48,280 --> 00:18:51,280
The discoveries kept coming throughout 1987.

265
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:56,560
By playing around with the original barium, lanthanum, copper, and oxygen ceramic formula,

266
00:18:56,560 --> 00:19:02,080
researchers were able to find corporate superconductors with increasingly higher transition temperatures.

267
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:06,720
But the gaps between science and technology can be quite large and take a long time to

268
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:07,720
overcome.

269
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:12,480
As it turns out, transition temperature was only one of the factors that engineers have

270
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:16,200
to consider when building commercially viable systems.

271
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:19,880
For instance, take superconducting wires for MRI machines.

272
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:24,640
The original promise of high-temperature superconductors was that we can swap out more expensive liquid

273
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:28,320
helium cooling systems for cheaper liquid nitrogen ones.

274
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:30,120
Should be easy, right?

275
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:34,200
But as Cameron Ling-Ona has found out long before, superconducting wires need to also

276
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:38,960
be able to carry high current densities and withstand very high magnetic fields.

277
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:42,200
In other words, they need to meet their critical parameters.

278
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:47,400
The corporate high-temperature superconductors do indeed have much higher transition temperatures,

279
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:51,720
but their other critical parameters are not as dramatically higher.

280
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:55,640
There was also a substantial materials engineering problem.

281
00:19:55,640 --> 00:20:01,040
Corporate superconductors are ceramics, complicated materials that are very brittle to work with.

282
00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:04,760
This by itself limited their usefulness as a material.

283
00:20:04,760 --> 00:20:06,520
They also work differently.

284
00:20:06,520 --> 00:20:10,880
If you recall, the cuprits are layered cakes, and all the superconducting happens within

285
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:14,840
those single flat layers of copper and oxygen.

286
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:19,160
This imposes big challenges on how we might achieve this superconductivity.

287
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:24,040
If we want to produce a wire using this material, it needs to be done in a specific way in order

288
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:28,520
to maintain good alignment over potentially hundreds of meters.

289
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:33,000
So it took a substantial amount of time to eventually engineer wire using high-temperature

290
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,000
superconductors.

291
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:39,160
They do exist, and are used for things like cables for power usage, but that took years

292
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:41,200
to develop.

293
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:45,520
Even if there are certain applications where the high-tea cuprits superconductors still

294
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:48,560
fall short of established technologies.

295
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:54,240
Neobium titanium established all the way back in 1970 continues to dominate superconducting

296
00:20:54,240 --> 00:21:00,720
wires for MRI machines, mostly due to their superior mechanical properties.

297
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:05,520
The slow speed of commercialization dampened enthusiasm and unfortunately high-temperature

298
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:11,320
superconductors could not uncover that golden killer app that would stimulate more investment

299
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:12,920
into the space.

300
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:17,120
Over time, the height receded as it became clear that the cuprits did not present a

301
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:21,680
way towards room-temperature superconductivity.

302
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:25,600
The scientific community did not forget Bednor's and Muller, though.

303
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:30,520
Just 16 months after their discovery, the tube won the Nobel Prize in Physics, the record

304
00:21:30,520 --> 00:21:35,480
for the fastest recognition in Nobel physics history.

305
00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:39,640
Superconductor research continued for another high-temperature alternative to the cuprits

306
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:40,640
superconductors.

307
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:48,560
In 2001, a Japanese team discovered an interesting non-cuprits superconductor magnesium diboride.

308
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:54,040
Its transition temperature was 39 Kelvin, far below the cuprits, but at least much higher

309
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:57,080
than the traditional low-temperature superconductors.

310
00:21:57,080 --> 00:22:03,160
Unfortunately, its behavior was conventional BCS, so a dead end.

311
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:08,720
The next significant high-temperature discovery came in February 2008, when Dr. Hideo Hosono

312
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:15,520
reported a fluorine-doped iron-based superconductor with a transition temperature of 26 Kelvin.

313
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:20,640
This opened up a new branch of high-temperature superconductors separate from the cuprits.

314
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:22,640
At the outset, there was a lot of hope.

315
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:28,040
A few months another iron superconductor was found with a transition temperature of 56

316
00:22:28,040 --> 00:22:32,080
Kelvin, but progress there has since stalled.

317
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:37,760
And then, recently in 2015, a team in Germany published a paper claiming superconductivity

318
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:42,560
in sulfur hydrides at over 200 Kelvin and high pressure.

319
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:47,520
Interesting but again nothing that has real-world industrial implications.

320
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:53,520
And there have been some questions about superconductivity in these sulfide hydrides.

321
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:59,960
One recent controversial room temperature claim was recently retracted by Nature Magazine.

322
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:05,080
The search continues for a room-temperature superconductor, or even a relatively high-temperature

323
00:23:05,080 --> 00:23:10,480
superconductor with fewer engineering compromises than what we already have.

324
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:12,740
Is LK99 really it?

325
00:23:12,740 --> 00:23:16,320
I don't know, but will it really change everything if it was?

326
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:18,480
Is it really the next transistor?

327
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:21,160
It is hard for me to believe that.

328
00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:25,920
When we dream of room-temperature superconductors, we talk about things like levitating trains,

329
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:30,000
compact MRIs, economical fusion energy, and the like.

330
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:34,000
Well, they have been citing these things since 1986.

331
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:39,680
Many applications are already technically possible with existing low-temperature superconductors.

332
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:44,920
But there are real economic reasons why we don't have those today.

333
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:47,620
For instance, magnets for maglev trains.

334
00:23:47,620 --> 00:23:51,400
The magnets are not a significant portion of the financial costs for these machines.

335
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:57,360
It is tied to the cost of the land, the labor, the extensive planning, and the construction.

336
00:23:57,360 --> 00:24:00,880
And then there is always the chance that a room-temperature superconductor, whether

337
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:06,160
LK99 is it or not, cannot compete with existing economic solutions.

338
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:07,920
Look again at the MRI.

339
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:12,680
Intuitively, you might think that this new generation of high-temperature cuprits would

340
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:18,800
sweep out the old superconducting wire tech used for those MRIs like yesterday's trash.

341
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:21,360
But it turned out to be far more subtle than that.

342
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:27,720
Even today, 30 years later, 80-90% of today's MRI machines are still made with good old

343
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:30,000
niobium titanium.

344
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,920
Just working these things into wires might take years.

345
00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:34,960
Remember these things are layered cakes.

346
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:37,800
Imagine making a cake hundreds of miles long.

347
00:24:37,800 --> 00:24:41,960
Real-world applications might be years and millions of dollars away.

348
00:24:41,960 --> 00:24:43,640
But hey, I hope I'm wrong.

349
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:46,240
I love the excitement around LK99.

350
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:50,760
No matter the outcome, the fascinating science of superconductivity is having another one

351
00:24:50,760 --> 00:24:52,600
of its unique moments.

352
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:55,360
This only happens ever so often in the world.

353
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:56,360
Let's enjoy it.

354
00:24:56,360 --> 00:24:57,600
Alright everyone, that's it for tonight.

355
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:58,600
Thanks for watching.
