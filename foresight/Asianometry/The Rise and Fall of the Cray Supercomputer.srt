00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,080
While working at Control Data Corporation, computer designer Seymour Cray was once asked

2
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:09,400
his five and one year goals.

3
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:10,400
He said,

4
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:14,440
5 year goal, build the biggest computer in the world.

5
00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:17,840
One year goal, one fifth of the above.

6
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:23,400
Seymour Cray literally only wanted one thing, and that was to take it to the limit.

7
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:28,640
In today's video we look back at a genius' lifelong quest to make the biggest supercomputers.

8
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:32,960
But first, this video is brought to you by the Asianometry Patreon.

9
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:37,920
Early access members get to see new videos first and selected references for those videos.

10
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:41,200
Early access really helps a lot and I appreciate every pledge.

11
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:42,960
Thank you, and on with the show.

12
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:49,760
Seymour Cray Jr. was born in the small town of Chippewa Falls, Wisconsin, in 1925.

13
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:52,720
The son of a civil engineer at the local power utility.

14
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:57,440
The elder Cray fostered in his son a love of science and engineering.

15
00:00:57,440 --> 00:01:03,040
The son adored chemistry, did electrician work for his junior prom, and showed a talent for radio.

16
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:08,720
After serving in the army as an electrician, Cray went to university on the GI Bill and

17
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:13,360
graduated from the University of Minnesota with a bachelor's in electrical engineering

18
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:14,960
and a master's in applied math.

19
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:20,240
Then in 1950 he joined a small company called Engineering Research Associates,

20
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:22,880
or ERA, in St. Paul, Minnesota.

21
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:28,320
During World War II, the U.S. Navy employed a team of elite code breakers.

22
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:34,080
This division was known as the Communication Supplementary Activity Washington, or CESA,

23
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:39,120
and in secret they designed and built powerful machines to break access naval codes,

24
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:40,880
mostly to find German submarines.

25
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:46,400
At the war's end, people realized that the U.S. government still needed to break codes,

26
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:50,800
Soviet codes this time, but with budget cuts they cannot afford to keep their employees.

27
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:55,040
So the Navy worked with an investment banker named John Parker

28
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:58,800
to set up a for-profit company that would hire and employ the old team

29
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:00,080
at higher salaries.

30
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:01,120
This was ERA.

31
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:06,800
ERA's people worked largely in secret out of an old glider factory.

32
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:09,760
Their first products were code-breaking machines like before,

33
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:14,960
but the team quickly began moving towards useful general-purpose computers,

34
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:18,160
leveraging emerging technologies like magnetic drum memory.

35
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:22,320
One of the first such products was the ERA1101.

36
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:27,600
The computer was a commercialized version of a device sold to one of the precursors of the NSA.

37
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:33,520
You can say that Minnesota in the 1950s was Silicon Valley before Silicon Valley existed.

38
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:38,640
Thanks to the strong military presence, it was America's premier computing center.

39
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:44,800
Despite being just 25 years old, Cray showed himself to be a talented worker.

40
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:50,080
Cray was quiet, but had the unshakable confidence to speak up when something was wrong.

41
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:54,800
He had incredible focus and rigid discipline, and of course he was brilliant,

42
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:57,680
with a gift for understanding the world of binary numbers.

43
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:02,960
Thus, Cray was challenged to produce the control system for ERA's next computer,

44
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:04,480
the ERA1103.

45
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:09,840
The control system breaks down the software's instructions into execution steps.

46
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:14,880
Control system design required front-to-back knowledge of the computer's guts

47
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:19,360
because it had to coordinate all those resources to efficiently execute the program.

48
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,760
Cray did the work and quickly rose up the ranks to supervise the team.

49
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:28,080
Like another legend of the times on Wong of Wong Labs,

50
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:31,520
Seymour Cray's genius can make him sometimes difficult to work for.

51
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:36,080
Cray preferred to work alone, spending late nights in the workshop.

52
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:39,520
If someone wasn't doing it right or was taking too long,

53
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:41,760
he reassigned them and did it himself.

54
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:44,000
They called it being scrayed.

55
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:48,560
But despite being very quiet, Seymour treated his colleagues well

56
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:51,120
and was generally liked and respected.

57
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:56,400
Just a big eccentric and enigmatic, exactly as a genius computer designer should be.

58
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:02,320
In December 1951, President and original investor John Parker

59
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:05,200
sold ERA to the computer company, Remington Rand.

60
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:09,440
Parker didn't tell the employees that ERA about this

61
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:12,160
which in bird culture is considered a dick move.

62
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:15,680
And an angered key workers like William Norris

63
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:18,960
who joined early and rose to become VP of operations.

64
00:04:20,080 --> 00:04:23,280
Remington Rand was a typewriter and shaver company.

65
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:24,160
Why computers?

66
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:28,880
Even more strangely, Rand had already bought a computer company earlier,

67
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:31,200
the Eckhart Mockley Computer Corporation.

68
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:36,720
Jay Presper Eckhart and John Mockley will forever be known for making ENIAC,

69
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:38,720
the first programmable digital computer.

70
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:43,440
And then EDVAC, pioneering the stored program computer design

71
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:46,320
that today underpins the von Neumann architecture.

72
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:52,080
Along the way, Eckhart also created the first course on electronic digital computers,

73
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:56,880
the Moore School Lectures, which helped popularize the von Neumann architecture.

74
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:58,320
No relation to Moore's law.

75
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:02,880
And then UNIVAC won, a computer that Garnard renowned for predicting

76
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:08,400
that some dude named Dwight Eisenhower would win the 1952 U.S. presidential election.

77
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:13,040
The world famous Eckhart and Mockley had serious computer credentials,

78
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:16,080
so the guys at ERA accepted the arrangement.

79
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:19,520
Eckhart Mockley would focus on the business computer marketplace

80
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:22,240
while ERA focused on scientific computing.

81
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:24,560
But tensions remained.

82
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:27,680
Today the computing needs of both business and science

83
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:30,320
can be handled by a general purpose computer,

84
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:33,120
but in those days the computers had to be more specific.

85
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:37,760
Computers for business did simple operations,

86
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:42,640
adding, subtracting, and multiplying, and with only two decimal points of accuracy.

87
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:46,480
However, this had to be done at large scale,

88
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:49,120
thousands of rows going in and out of the computer.

89
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:54,800
Scientific computing was different in that it required complex calculations

90
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:57,680
with up to 20 to 30 decimal points of accuracy.

91
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:03,520
Such a computer might munch on a problem for hours just to produce a single line of output.

92
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:06,960
The guys at Eckhart Mockley in Philadelphia

93
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:10,320
looked down on the Minnesota guys as mere quote-unquote farmers

94
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:12,240
who did not work on the state of the art,

95
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:16,400
and the Minnesota guys saw the Philadelphians as theoreticians

96
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:19,200
who only cared about making computers faster,

97
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:21,440
even if it meant them breaking down a lot.

98
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:29,520
Things got worse in 1955 when Rand merged with the Sperry Corporation to become Sperry Rand.

99
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:35,360
The merger forced together the two formerly independent units into one Unifact division.

100
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:41,840
The tensions really flared between ERA, Eckhart, and their new corporate overlords.

101
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:43,600
The aforementioned William Norris,

102
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:47,360
the division's new general manager, said to the Philadelphia guys,

103
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:51,360
you people run a laboratory, and ERA runs a business.

104
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:57,120
When Sperry took over its top management, including President Harry Vickers,

105
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:01,200
thought that they were buying a market leader. That was not the case.

106
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:05,280
Unifact had the potential to be what IBM eventually became,

107
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:10,080
but it needed the capital to get there. Not only in R&D to build the machines,

108
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:14,720
but also because computers were an equipment leasing business back then.

109
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:16,400
It was very capital intensive.

110
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:23,440
In 1957, enough was enough. Norris left Sperry Rand to found a new company,

111
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:28,720
Control Data Corporation, or CDC. A new company was a huge risk,

112
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:32,480
but Norris figured that if it did not work, then he and his family

113
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:34,640
could go back to their farm in Nebraska.

114
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:38,720
Norris invited a few of his ERA co-workers to come with him.

115
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:43,520
Cray was one of those who accepted, having seen the writing on the wall when he noticed

116
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:49,360
an accounting system categorize his project as 999, miscellaneous, and other.

117
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:58,080
CDC started in July 1957 with its employees, a vague idea to make computers and some money from

118
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:05,920
friends. No plant, no product, and little money. To get the company off the ground, CDC IPO'd.

119
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:10,720
Like literally, they stood on the street and sold shares to ordinary members of the public

120
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:14,160
for a dollar each. This is probably not possible today.

121
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:18,960
The company got its first splash of publicity from an unexpected spot.

122
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:24,800
Sid Hartman, a sports columnist at the Minneapolis Tribune and former part-time

123
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:27,120
general manager of the Minneapolis Lakers, what?

124
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:30,560
Mentioned the move at the end of one of his sports column.

125
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:35,440
Many prominent local investors declined an investment in CDC,

126
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:40,720
one saying that they, quote, didn't have a ghost of a chance, end quote, against IBM.

127
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:47,200
Decliners included a guy named Warren Buffett. Despite being William Norris' nephew by marriage,

128
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:52,320
he declined due to a lack of understanding, but he's poor now and deeply regrets that.

129
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:57,440
Years later, the $1 shares would be worth about many times that.

130
00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:03,440
The early CDC IPO enriched the company's 300 initial investors and created a generation

131
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:05,360
of new wealth in the Minnesota area.

132
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:11,520
Craig was the most technical person at the new company and persuaded his co-founders to

133
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:17,280
build scientific computers rather than going to the commercial market. His reasoning was that

134
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:22,800
their clientele universities and nuclear weapons research labs cared less about marketing and

135
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:29,200
client service and they programmed their own software. What they wanted was compute, serious

136
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:35,120
compute. Due to treaty obligations, you can't just test fire a nuclear weapon and even discounting

137
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:41,920
the environmental issues cannot easily measure its workings. So to study a detonation, we needed

138
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:48,400
computers to simulate the bomb's chain reactions, stepping through all the equations every microsecond

139
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:53,600
after detonation. That means the biggest and fastest computers on the market.

140
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:59,760
Craig was convinced that he could build such a computer at a relatively bearable cost using

141
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:05,120
transistors. He went down to the local electronics shop and found that they were selling reject

142
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:09,680
bipolar transistors for radios for cheaper than what you can get from the factory.

143
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:17,040
These reject transistors suck outputting a weak signal. So Craig paired them up in what is called

144
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:23,120
a Darlington pair with the second transistor amplifying the output of the first. The experience

145
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:28,560
taught him that with the right design, you can use substandard components and still achieve the goal.

146
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:34,720
Over a year into the venture with money running low, Bill Norris strikes a deal with the US Navy

147
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:42,320
for what would be called the CDC-1604 computer in 1958. But now they have to build it at scale,

148
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:47,440
buying a factory and hiring more engineers. Norris and other managers cut their salaries

149
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:53,040
in half to save money. Engineers resorted to swiping transistor companies as free-sales

150
00:10:53,040 --> 00:11:00,640
samples for their computer. The CDC-1604 first hit the market in 1960, carrying a price tag of

151
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:09,440
$990,000 or about $10.4 million today. At 0.2 MHz, it was the most powerful commercially available

152
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:17,040
computer of the time, a supercomputer. A supercomputer is a bit of a squishy term. It's about pushing

153
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:21,760
the envelope and computing, bringing out a computer that leads all others in its field.

154
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:27,120
Control data was not alone in the market of producing super-fast computers for niche customers.

155
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:34,400
Univac released the Livermore Automatic Reaction Calculator, LARC, in 1960, the same year as the

156
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:40,640
1604's release. It helped Edward Teller do simulations for the hydrogen bomb and was the most

157
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:48,000
powerful computer in the world from 1960 to 1961. The LARC scared IBM so much that they built the

158
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:55,120
IBM-7030 stretch supercomputer designed by the legendary Gene Amdahl. The 7030 took back the

159
00:11:55,120 --> 00:12:02,080
crown of the world's most powerful supercomputer and retained it until 1964. But the LARC and

160
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:09,200
Stretch were basically made to order products. Univac only made two LARC units. Control data

161
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:13,680
turned the supercomputer into a category, a commercially successful one at that.

162
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:20,000
The 1604 sold to the University of Illinois, Lockheed, the State of Israel, and more.

163
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:26,080
The company began to turn a profit, challenging the old computer giants like Rand and IBM.

164
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:33,120
CDC stock went from $1 to $9, and now Norris had to keep the engineers from selling their stock

165
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:41,520
too early. After the 1604, Cray and CDC debated about how to proceed. Follow up on the 1604

166
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:46,560
and finally attack the lucrative business data processing market. This would mean iterating

167
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:53,840
on the 1604 architecture, making smaller computers like the CDC 160A a very good and successful

168
00:12:53,840 --> 00:13:00,320
control applications computer. But Cray only wanted to build the fastest possible machine.

169
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:05,600
The scientific community had only started to realize a new form of computational modeling,

170
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:09,040
finite element analysis, which I mentioned in a prior video.

171
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:15,120
Finite element analysis involves splitting something down into millions of simpler elements

172
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:21,200
and running simulations based on how those elements might act. For instance, breaking a car down into

173
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:27,360
tiny shapes and using that to predict how it might survive a car crash. With finite element analysis,

174
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:32,000
the more steps you can break something down into, the better you can model and predict

175
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:38,480
complex systems like the weather or nuclear explosions. This basically implied an infinite

176
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:45,600
need for compute. Cray wanted to be the guy to feed that need for speed. He threatened to

177
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:50,720
leave the company over this issue, which caused Norris to eventually agree on splitting the two

178
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:58,240
teams. One CDC team would work on a 1604 follow up. Meanwhile, the 35 year old Cray and his team

179
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:04,160
were allowed to open their own lab in Cray's hometown of Chippewa Falls, Wisconsin. This new

180
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:09,520
lab was just a brief stroll from his house. There, Cray and his team worked on a machine

181
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:18,000
some 15 times faster than the 1604, named the 6600. When Cray and his team sat down to make

182
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:25,680
the CDC 6600, they started off with something like the 1604. The 1604 was built with ferrite

183
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:31,920
magnetic cores for main memory and magnetic tape for secondary storage. For compute, it had

184
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:37,120
germanium transistors. Everything was built inside air-cooled, pluggable building blocks.

185
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:44,880
But as they worked on the 6600, Cray changed many things. Critically, he saw silicon planar

186
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:49,520
transistors from Fairchild. They switched far faster than germanium transistors,

187
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:57,120
automatically granting a 5x speed boost. The rest of the 10-15x speed up goal, though,

188
00:14:57,120 --> 00:15:02,720
had to come from somewhere else. Cray soon soured on the building block approach. Each

189
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:08,640
block had extensive back panel wiring, which not only caused noise issues but also limited input

190
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:14,960
output and increased how long it took to transmit data. So Cray threw it all out and switched to

191
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:21,920
using denser, more complex custom modules called cordwood modules. The shorter wires improved

192
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:27,520
speed but also made it difficult to repair and necessitated the replacement of air cooling

193
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:34,080
with freon gas cooling. Another concept they implemented was parallelism. Every system has

194
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:40,160
to do housekeeping functions or the such in addition to the main compute task. Why should the main

195
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:48,000
processor have to do that? Offloaded to something else. The 6600 contained 11 individual computers

196
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:52,560
that can execute programs separately from each other. They only shared a central memory.

197
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:58,320
10 of the computers handled secondary work like peripherals leaving the 11th computer free to

198
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:05,920
do nothing but high speed math. Additionally, the 6600 lived and breathed simplicity. A computer

199
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:12,560
CPU uses something called an instruction set architecture or ISA to define its basic operations

200
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:20,640
thus also defining how software can control it. The 6600 simplified its ISA ditching everything

201
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:26,960
unrelated to scientific computing like for instance instructions for handling large amounts of data

202
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:33,040
something more geared for commercial users. This simplified instruction set allowed the computer

203
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:39,040
to quote quote pipeline tasks breaking down a bigger job to smaller ones that can be assigned

204
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:46,960
to peripheral computers to work on simultaneously. CDC delivered its first 6600 to Lawrence Livermore

205
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:55,360
in 1964. The machine's incredible speed three times faster than the 7030 shocked IBM. Chairman

206
00:16:55,360 --> 00:17:02,000
Thomas J. Watson Jr. wrote a scathing memo asking how quote 34 people including the janitor and quote

207
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:08,320
beat the biggest technology company in the world. The answer of course was that IBM's architects

208
00:17:08,320 --> 00:17:15,280
could not bear to sacrifice compatibility for speed. The splitting of the teams within control

209
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:21,280
data prevented a blow up but discontent continued to faster. Norris and other managers continued

210
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:27,040
to build up the business. CDC began making its own peripherals and software to accompany the main

211
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:33,440
computer building a services business. Control data also purchased a consumer finance company

212
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:39,840
commercial credit intending to use their 3.4 billion dollars of working capital to fund its

213
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:46,240
computer leasing strategy. This strategy which seemed smart at the time eventually backfired

214
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:53,840
when commercial credit ran into difficulties. Over 100 CDC 6600s were sold to big customers

215
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:59,280
like the atomic energy commission but each cost 8 million dollars or about 23 million today.

216
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:04,720
As you might think it limited the market to about 50 total customers in the world.

217
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:11,440
But Seymour Cray felt this was a feature not a bug. He loved knowing the first names of each

218
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:16,880
of his customers. The control data's management was increasingly coming to the belief that

219
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:24,000
peripherals and services not hardware were the company's future. Control data followed up the

220
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:31,280
CDC 6600 with the 7600 and it was hailed as the world's fastest computer five times faster than

221
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:37,680
the 6600. But despite costing only twice as much of its predecessor it sold poorly in part due to

222
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:45,120
frequent breakdowns and a weak economy. Then after that we had the 8600. This supercomputer was made

223
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:51,840
with regular discrete transistors but Cray wanted a clock cycle time of 8 nanoseconds which meant

224
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:57,360
every wire had to be shorter than 2.5 meters squeezing those parts very close together.

225
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:03,440
Things got so dense that Cray couldn't figure out how to sufficiently cool them.

226
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:09,120
After many months he decided to throw everything out and start again from scratch. It was his style

227
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:16,480
the Cray way. But this was 1971 and control data was in the midst of an expensive antitrust lawsuit

228
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:23,920
against IBM. Cash flow was running low. Cray was asked to cut expenses by 10% unwilling to do that

229
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:31,200
he cut his own salary to minimum wage or $1.25 an hour. This did not solve the issue and in the

230
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:37,440
end Norris told Cray that a redo like before could not be done. They already pre-sold two 8600

231
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:45,920
systems and in 1972 Cray decided to leave and start his own shop Cray Research. Seymour Cray

232
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:52,560
founded Cray Research with $2.5 million, 20% of which was his own money and a bunch of bank loans.

233
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:58,400
The company's goal was to build the biggest computer one at a time like a master artisan.

234
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:03,520
It did not care for big revenues nor did it expect them. The focus was on research rather

235
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:10,240
than manufacture like Star Trek plumbing the outer limits of possibility. In a show of goodwill

236
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:15,600
Norris and control data arranged a luncheon to say goodbye and invested a quarter million dollars in

237
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:22,560
the new company. Norris called it heart money. For his first computer the Cray one Seymour Cray

238
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:29,120
wanted revolutionary performance to get it he decided to turn to a new concept vector processing.

239
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:36,160
Most CPUs of the time used scalar processing meaning the process single data items like integers

240
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:42,800
or floating point numbers one at a time. So imagine the job of adding one in one a scalar

241
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:48,960
CPU would load the first one into its register from memory load the second one add them and then

242
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:55,200
store the result into memory counted up this job used four instructions. So if we are summing up

243
00:20:55,200 --> 00:21:02,560
two sets of 20 numbers that is 80 instructions that a scalar CPU has to handle a vector processing

244
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:08,000
machine shortcuts that by processing single dimension arrays of data vectors. So if we

245
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:13,200
have those two vectors containing 20 numbers each loading the two vectors into the register

246
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:19,200
adding them and storing the result vector into memory that only uses four instructions rather

247
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:25,360
than 80. Control data knew about vector processing too they had a small team working on a vector

248
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:30,800
computer called the star 100 but the star was tremendously complicated and failed to live

249
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:35,920
up to its promises. Control data shipped it four years late and sold only three of them.

250
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:43,120
Cray studied the star 100 and realized its flaws first its scalar processing was slow

251
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:48,880
bottlenecking the overall system performance and second the computer's vector processing

252
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:54,640
implementation had a hitch recall my example from before before you can run the addition

253
00:21:54,640 --> 00:22:00,000
operation on the two vectors you first have to load them both into the register same with

254
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:05,520
sending results back to memory. The problem was that this was taking too long doesn't

255
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:10,640
matter how much faster vector processing is compared to scalar processing if handling the

256
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:16,960
vectors took forever. So Cray introduced vector registers very fast intermediate memory systems

257
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:23,040
that work like cache memory to improve speed. Seymour also decided to adopt integrated circuits

258
00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:28,560
for the first time this allowed for more density and cut down on wiring allowing the Cray one to

259
00:22:28,560 --> 00:22:35,600
be far smaller than its predecessors. By then ICs were roughly about 14 years old and quite mature

260
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:41,040
but reflects Cray's approach of choosing older technologies quote a decade behind end quote as

261
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:47,520
he'd like to say so that they are more reliable but when it came to memory Cray could not compromise

262
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:52,000
he broke his principle and bought bipolar semiconductor memory chips to replace the

263
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:59,280
old core memories it cost less had more density and eight less power. The computer's clock cycle

264
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:06,080
of 12.5 nanoseconds made it five times faster than the CDC 7600 so every wire in the machine had to

265
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:12,720
be less than four feet long and of course you can't forget its iconic look a circular shape to

266
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:17,520
accommodate the new cooling scheme but with an added bit of flair to differentiate from the

267
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:24,560
boring gray boxes of the era and it had cushions too. The Cray one made a huge stir upon its release

268
00:23:24,560 --> 00:23:30,720
in 1976 with its flashy look and world-beating speed. A hundred Cray ones were sold to various

269
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:36,000
government and university lab customers like the National Center for Atmospheric Research

270
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:44,240
and the Department of Defense. It generated 150 revenue growth for Cray research from 1978 to 1979

271
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:50,480
with another 50 growth a year after that. The orders came in so fast one a month which is a lot

272
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:56,560
for eight million dollar product that a big backlog developed. IBM did not even try to compete

273
00:23:57,200 --> 00:24:03,200
Cray's former employer control data found itself thrown off its feet they tried producing vector

274
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:10,960
computers like the cyber 205 but they had gotten bloated and complicated unable to keep up. The

275
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:15,440
company suffered large financial losses and eventually sold itself off in pieces by the

276
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:22,320
mid 1980s CDC's most profitable business was Ticketron a rival to the widely despised Ticketmaster.

277
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:28,720
As I said Seymour Cray wanted to build the fastest computer and to build it from a clean

278
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:35,040
piece of paper. Even as the Cray one was in the late stages of development Seymour started to shift

279
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:41,680
his gaze towards a machine even more ambitious the Cray two with a clock speed some three to six

280
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:48,320
times faster than its predecessor. Such a machine had obstacles with that clock speed no wire can

281
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:53,600
be longer than 40 centimeters again bringing back the same heating challenges Cray faced with the

282
00:24:53,600 --> 00:25:00,960
8600 and to his dismay Seymour could not focus on solving these problems because his business needed

283
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:06,640
him to fund early development Cray research IPO did stock which brought on a whole load of new

284
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:13,680
responsibilities and a bit poetically the company's success caused new headaches since each Cray one

285
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:19,760
was hand-wired and custom-made like some limited edition supercar a process that took a year the

286
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:27,040
company had no choice but to staff up to deliver on his big backlog from 1978 to 1980 the company

287
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:35,040
grew from 300 to 500 people rapid growth and at its peak Cray research employed over 5000 people

288
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:41,280
in the tiny town of Chippewa Falls Wisconsin Seymour originally pursued scientific computing

289
00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:47,840
because users wrote their own hardware it let him just focus on hardware but times had changed

290
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:53,920
customers no longer had the budget to rewrite their software every time they wanted portability

291
00:25:53,920 --> 00:26:00,080
it is why the Unix operating system got to be so popular so Cray's customers were increasingly

292
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:05,600
interested in getting a better Cray one than a radically different Cray two which would require

293
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:14,000
them to redo all their software it was the story of control data in the 1604 all over again eventually

294
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:20,400
Cray research's management including CEO John Rohlwagen did the dual approach once more on one

295
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:26,320
side they extended the Cray one line with the 1s still a powerful computer but not radically different

296
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:32,640
like a Cray two might be meanwhile Seymour Cray stepped down as chairman in 1981 handing that

297
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:37,680
job over to the CEO Rohlwagen and became an independent contractor so that he could work on

298
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:44,400
the Cray two he moved to Boulder Colorado to work in peace once more the Cray two eventually did

299
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:51,040
come out in 1985 after three false starts on the cooling system famously had this massive liquid

300
00:26:51,040 --> 00:26:56,640
immersion cooling system that caused the machine to resemble an aquarium even so memory latency

301
00:26:56,640 --> 00:27:02,960
caused the system to underperform its full potential then to the surprise of many Seymour's Cray two

302
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:10,000
found itself upstaged by another computer produced by a separate team the Cray XMP supercomputer the

303
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:15,920
XMP team was led by a longtime Cray collaborator named Les Davis as well as a talented young

304
00:27:15,920 --> 00:27:22,800
Taiwanese-American designer named Steve Chen where the Cray one had a single CPU the XMP

305
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:29,120
introduced parallel processing with four CPUs along with new solid state storage semiconductors

306
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:36,320
released in 1983 the XMP was the world's fastest supercomputer two to five times faster than the

307
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:43,840
1s without the radical design changes of the Cray two people were stunned it sold very well compared

308
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:50,880
to the Cray two by 1989 there were only 24 units of the Cray two sold as compared to the almost 200

309
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:59,120
units sold of the XMP and its immediate successor the YMP there were other changes in the 1970s Cray

310
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:04,320
had no competitors for its unique part of the market but throughout the 1980s new supercomputer

311
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:12,000
competitors started to emerge out of the woodwork first over in Japan where Fujitsu Hitachi and NEC

312
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:16,960
leveraged Japan's growing advantages in VLSI semiconductor production to make compelling

313
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:23,120
supercomputers Cray still dominated the market in 1988 they had 56 percent market share of

314
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:28,720
traditional supercomputers but the Japanese all together had 37 percent and were making ground

315
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:35,120
in a similar vein supercomputer startups like Thinking Machines and N-Cube began exploring

316
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:39,840
new approaches of supercomputing beyond just vector computing the most prominent of which are

317
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:46,640
massively parallel systems or MPPs these systems coordinate many commercial microprocessors to do

318
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:52,240
millions or even billions of floating point operations each second these microprocessors

319
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:58,640
being bought off the shelf meant far better price for performance this combined competition from the

320
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:04,400
startups the Japanese and even old friends like control data supercomputer spin-off ETA systems

321
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:08,720
put a lot of pressure on Cray to focus this approach and its product lineup

322
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:15,440
Cray researchers unexpected success with the XMP would come back to haunted designer Steve Chen

323
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:20,800
was featured as one of the company's young exciting rising talents the next Seymour Cray even

324
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:26,320
but unfortunately the aggressive vision that Chen and his team had for the MP line after the YMP

325
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:33,360
spiraled beyond what the company can financially support 64 processors custom integrated circuits

326
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:39,600
and maybe even optical interconnects in 1987 the company was already invested in developing

327
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:45,920
Seymour Cray's next machine the Cray 3 and the YMP in addition to three existing products that needed

328
00:29:45,920 --> 00:29:52,800
money too they had no money for Chen's science fiction dream so that year Cray research scaled

329
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:58,320
back the MP line of computers in response the much heralded Steve Chen quit Cray research

330
00:29:58,400 --> 00:30:04,560
and started his own company Supercomputer Systems Supercomputer Systems took 150 million

331
00:30:04,560 --> 00:30:10,160
dollars of investment money from IBM and other investors like Ford and Boeing but went bankrupt

332
00:30:10,160 --> 00:30:17,760
in 1993 in 1989 the company could no longer accommodate its former founder Seymour Cray

333
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:24,240
joined a spin-off called Cray Computer Corporation or CCC in Colorado to work on the future Cray 3

334
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:31,360
Cray research thusly would go onwards with the existing Cray XMP architecture building the ecosystem

335
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:36,720
the Cray 3 would have used gallium arsenide semiconductors for switching performance far

336
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:42,000
faster than what was possible with silicon it necessitated buying a lot of chip making equipment

337
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:49,200
the Cray 3 soon fell behind and in 1991 various customers started canceling their orders because

338
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:55,520
of cratering defense demand after the fall of the Soviet Union CCC would only sell one system

339
00:30:55,520 --> 00:31:02,720
before filing for bankruptcy in 1995 and announced Cray 4 never materialized either Seymour Cray's

340
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:08,560
cherished approach of sitting down with a clean sheet of paper and building a big iron supercomputer

341
00:31:08,560 --> 00:31:16,000
was no longer financially viable Seymour Cray formed a new company SRC computers to begin exploring

342
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:23,360
parallel designs but he then passed away in 1996 at the age of 71 due to injuries from a car accident

343
00:31:24,560 --> 00:31:28,960
Cray research was eventually sold to Silicon Graphics and it bounced around for a while

344
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:32,640
but is now part of Hewlett Packard Enterprise as just Cray Inc.

345
00:31:34,560 --> 00:31:39,680
Advancing semiconductor technologies have made the supercomputers of the past seem comically behind

346
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:45,600
in 2010 an electrical engineer named Chris Fenton did a project to emulate the Cray 1a

347
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:52,480
supercomputer using a Xilinx Spartan 3e 1600 development board he even put it into a cute

348
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:58,400
little Cray 1 package and it now sits in the computer history museum where it inspired this video

349
00:31:59,520 --> 00:32:04,960
today's leading edge semiconductor makers now face the same issues as Cray did with his supercomputers

350
00:32:05,040 --> 00:32:10,480
thermal problems interconnect problems slowdowns due to memory retrieval I am struck

351
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:16,240
by the similarities unfortunately the semiconductor industry cannot do as Seymour did

352
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:21,760
throw it all out and start anew with a fresh sheet of paper all right everyone that's it for

353
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:28,000
