00:00.000 --> 00:07.280
Hello, everyone, and welcome to the session of Incredible Minds.

00:07.280 --> 00:11.920
I'm James B. Barbieri, program coordinator here at the Paris Center and your host for

00:11.920 --> 00:13.000
today.

00:13.000 --> 00:17.120
Any problems, just let me know in the chat and I'll try and help you.

00:17.120 --> 00:21.520
Just very briefly, a quick reminder to make sure your microphone is muted.

00:21.520 --> 00:25.120
We do encourage you all to turn on your cameras.

00:25.120 --> 00:30.640
The chat is open, so feel free to share your thoughts and ideas with the rest of the group

00:30.640 --> 00:32.880
throughout this session.

00:32.880 --> 00:39.040
And we do have closed captions available if that's how you prefer to view the session.

00:39.040 --> 00:42.960
Finding the session is recorded for archival purposes and for you all, you should receive

00:42.960 --> 00:46.080
the link in a few days.

00:46.080 --> 00:51.920
So today we are honored to be joined by Michael Levin, who received a dual undergraduate

00:51.920 --> 00:57.040
degree in computer science and biology, followed by PhD in molecular genetics from Harvard.

00:57.040 --> 01:02.440
He did his postdoc training at Harvard Medical School and started his independent lab in

01:02.440 --> 01:03.440
2000.

01:03.440 --> 01:08.920
He is currently the Vannevar Bush Chair at the Tufts University, an associate faculty

01:08.920 --> 01:11.920
member of the Vice Institute of Harvard.

01:11.920 --> 01:17.240
He serves as the founding director of the Allen Discovery Center at Tufts.

01:17.240 --> 01:24.320
His lab uses a mix of developmental biophysics, computer science, and behavior science to

01:24.320 --> 01:29.560
understand the emergence of mind and unconventional embodiments at all scales, and to develop

01:29.560 --> 01:36.040
interventions in regenerative medicine and application in synthetic bioengineering.

01:36.040 --> 01:42.000
Today he will be talking to us about the collective intelligence of cells with morphogenesis, while

01:42.000 --> 01:47.160
bioelectricity outside the brain means for understanding our multi-scale nature.

01:47.160 --> 01:49.480
And with that, I'll pass it over to you, Michael.

01:49.480 --> 01:50.480
Welcome.

01:50.480 --> 01:51.480
Thank you so much.

01:51.480 --> 01:56.240
I really appreciate the opportunity to share some ideas with you and to be part of this

01:56.240 --> 02:00.520
event and some of the other speakers you've had, which were tremendous.

02:00.520 --> 02:02.320
So let me see.

02:02.320 --> 02:03.320
All right.

02:03.320 --> 02:04.480
Can everybody see the slides?

02:04.480 --> 02:05.480
Is it good?

02:05.480 --> 02:06.480
Okay.

02:06.480 --> 02:07.480
Yeah.

02:07.480 --> 02:11.520
So if you're interested in this after the fact, you can find at this website here,

02:11.520 --> 02:16.320
you can find all of the primary papers, the software, the data sets, everything, everything

02:16.320 --> 02:17.320
is here.

02:17.320 --> 02:19.160
And you can also get in touch with me here.

02:19.160 --> 02:24.560
So today, what I'd like to transmit to you are some examples of the following main points.

02:24.560 --> 02:30.080
I'm going to stress this idea that all intelligence is collective intelligence, and in particular,

02:30.080 --> 02:36.600
the notion of scaling from the competencies of simple subunits to larger kinds of cognitive

02:36.600 --> 02:37.600
systems.

02:37.600 --> 02:42.080
We're going to talk about problem-solving in diverse and unconventional problem spaces,

02:42.080 --> 02:47.720
and we're going to talk about the navigation of these virtual spaces as intelligence.

02:47.720 --> 02:50.400
We'll talk about a kind of goal-directedness.

02:50.400 --> 02:54.600
We'll talk about agency and unconventional embodiments.

02:54.600 --> 03:00.360
And towards the end, this idea of universal hacking and of components of biological systems,

03:00.360 --> 03:05.040
trying to manipulate the behavior of other systems, both above, below, and lateral to

03:05.040 --> 03:06.040
them.

03:06.160 --> 03:11.760
I'm going to spend about a third of the talk using anatomical control as an example of

03:11.760 --> 03:16.840
a collective intelligence of cells navigating a particular kind of anatomical space.

03:16.840 --> 03:21.400
And I'm going to show you lots of data on bioelectric networks as a kind of cognitive

03:21.400 --> 03:26.200
glue that is the ancestor of brain function.

03:26.200 --> 03:32.240
And we're going to talk about the impact that this is going to have on biomedicine.

03:32.360 --> 03:37.920
Towards the end, I'm going to talk about some synthetic bioengineering and ways to think

03:37.920 --> 03:44.480
about creating and then relating to novel types of beings, which has lots of implications

03:44.480 --> 03:47.240
for science, for engineering, and for ethics.

03:47.240 --> 03:51.200
So the talk is going to go in three parts, and what I'll do is, at the end of each part,

03:51.200 --> 03:56.400
I'm going to pause, I'll take some questions, we'll take a break, people can get up and

03:56.400 --> 04:00.320
stretch and get water and whatnot, and then we'll continue.

04:00.320 --> 04:07.520
So the first part is going to be my efforts to break down some common categories and some

04:07.520 --> 04:10.600
terminology that I think is really limiting the field.

04:10.600 --> 04:15.480
And so for this reason, we're going to talk about stretching that into a kind of continuum

04:15.480 --> 04:19.600
of various types of agents, and I want to show you some examples.

04:19.600 --> 04:26.440
So this is, even though this is fairly, fairly a very old view, this is a famous painting

04:26.440 --> 04:30.200
of Adam naming the animals in the Garden of Eden.

04:30.200 --> 04:34.080
This is still actually quite prevalent in many, many relevant discussions.

04:34.080 --> 04:40.520
What you see here is that there's a very sharp binary distinction between Adam here and the

04:40.520 --> 04:42.040
rest of the animals.

04:42.040 --> 04:47.800
So it's very clear that there are different kinds of creatures, fundamentally different

04:47.800 --> 04:48.880
kinds.

04:48.880 --> 04:57.920
But what we know now, because of Darwin and because of Von Baer, is that actually this

04:57.920 --> 05:02.600
notion that there's some kind of a sharp binary category of being a human is actually

05:02.600 --> 05:09.040
a smooth continuum, both on an evolutionary time scale, where if you slide back in evolutionary

05:09.040 --> 05:15.760
time, you see a very gradual set of changes that go from that human all the way back to

05:15.760 --> 05:17.880
a microbe and below that.

05:17.880 --> 05:23.440
And of course, even on the life scale of the individual itself, you see we all start life

05:23.440 --> 05:29.720
as a single cell, and then slowly and gradually we become what is basically considered to

05:29.720 --> 05:31.640
be a standard human.

05:31.640 --> 05:36.800
So we are at the center of this kind of continuum that stretches in two different timescales,

05:36.800 --> 05:42.640
but it's actually even more complex than that, because now with bioengineering and various

05:42.640 --> 05:48.800
other technologies, there are additional axes in this space where we can stretch the notion

05:48.800 --> 05:50.440
of what a human actually is.

05:50.440 --> 05:55.200
And you can imagine slowly adding various prosthetics, various technologies within the

05:55.200 --> 06:01.400
body as is already happening, people who can control wheelchairs with their minds via implants

06:01.400 --> 06:02.400
and things like this.

06:02.400 --> 06:08.800
And of course, biological modifications that we can make both genetic and non-genetic.

06:08.800 --> 06:13.720
And so we see here that and at every level of organization, cell tissue organism and

06:13.720 --> 06:22.240
so on, we can replace native naturally evolved materials with all sorts of novel, either

06:22.240 --> 06:24.760
natural or engineered materials.

06:24.760 --> 06:32.560
And so we start to see that this notion of a standard human can be quite continuous in

06:32.560 --> 06:34.240
a number of different dimensions.

06:34.240 --> 06:40.360
And so I've been trying to develop a framework called TAME, and we'll talk about this more.

06:40.360 --> 06:43.680
TAME stands for technological approach to mind everywhere.

06:43.680 --> 06:51.880
And the idea is to be able to recognize, create, and relate to truly diverse intelligences,

06:51.880 --> 06:58.040
not just the familiar creatures like us and maybe birds and dolphins and things, but also

06:58.040 --> 07:03.520
really unusual creatures like colonial organisms and swarms and synthetic life forms that might

07:03.520 --> 07:11.280
be engineered, software artificial intelligences, possible alien life if that's found.

07:11.280 --> 07:17.240
So all of these things ought to be able to be handled by a mature science of diverse

07:17.240 --> 07:18.400
intelligence.

07:18.400 --> 07:23.400
And they have to be dealt with the same set of concepts regardless of what they're made

07:23.400 --> 07:29.120
of, so regardless of their composition or origin story, meaning evolved versus engineered

07:29.120 --> 07:30.720
or anything in between.

07:30.720 --> 07:33.840
And of course, I'm not the first person to try for something like this.

07:33.840 --> 07:38.480
So Rosenbluth, Wiener, and Bigelow did something like this.

07:38.480 --> 07:43.520
In the 40s where they gave us this ladder, where you can see that all the way from basically

07:43.520 --> 07:49.400
passive matter, all the way up through complex human metacognitive types of capacities, there

07:49.400 --> 07:52.520
are a set of great transitions.

07:52.520 --> 07:55.640
But nevertheless, these things are all on the same spectrum.

07:55.640 --> 08:02.680
The idea was that we should be able to understand how various types of material implementations

08:02.680 --> 08:07.000
can begin to have these kinds of functionalities.

08:07.000 --> 08:15.120
And so one of the essential ways of thinking about these things in my framework has to do

08:15.120 --> 08:17.560
with the relation of an observer.

08:17.560 --> 08:21.760
And that observer might be an engineer, it might be another conspecific, it might be some

08:21.760 --> 08:27.720
sort of a parasite or in fact, the evolutionary process itself, some sort of observer that

08:27.720 --> 08:31.320
is able to modulate what the system is doing.

08:31.320 --> 08:36.440
And so you can think about different ways of modulating a system depending on how sophisticated

08:36.440 --> 08:37.440
it is.

08:37.440 --> 08:40.800
So down here on this end of the spectrum, the only way you're going to make changes is

08:40.800 --> 08:43.600
by engineering directly at the hardware level.

08:43.600 --> 08:47.440
You're not going to convince a clock of anything, you're not going to reward and punish it.

08:47.440 --> 08:49.760
All there is is mechanical engineering.

08:49.760 --> 08:54.280
But you can cybernetics take this to things like this, these thermostats which have recorded

08:54.280 --> 08:55.280
set points.

08:55.280 --> 08:59.880
And so there you can do some interesting things such as modify the set point without rewiring

08:59.880 --> 09:04.320
the hardware and get the system to take on a novel set of goals without having to rewire

09:04.320 --> 09:05.320
it.

09:05.320 --> 09:09.160
And then of course, more complex systems, availous of an interface involving rewards

09:09.160 --> 09:14.200
and punishments and various other behavior shaping techniques where you can rely on the

09:14.200 --> 09:16.560
system to learn from experience.

09:16.560 --> 09:20.960
And then of course, we have even more, even more complex beings which are able to follow

09:20.960 --> 09:22.320
logic and so on.

09:22.320 --> 09:27.280
And so the difference in all of these different systems is not what they're made of or how

09:27.280 --> 09:32.440
they got here, but it's what are the set of tools and techniques that you might use to

09:32.440 --> 09:36.800
relate to that system all the way from physical rewiring to something that looks a lot more

09:36.800 --> 09:42.040
like a psychoanalysis where you're literally trying to affect the model that the system

09:42.040 --> 09:44.920
has of itself, of the outside world and so on.

09:44.920 --> 09:52.400
So this shows you the kind of inclusive framework we're trying to make.

09:52.400 --> 09:57.200
And the interesting thing is that all of us made this amazing journey across the Cartesian

09:57.200 --> 09:58.200
cut.

09:58.200 --> 10:04.000
We were all ones, so-called just physics, physics and chemistry, a little blob of protoplasm

10:04.000 --> 10:07.360
and an unfertilized oocyte, quiescent.

10:07.360 --> 10:12.280
And then through the process of embryonic development, we became one of these functional

10:12.280 --> 10:15.560
creatures or even something like this.

10:15.560 --> 10:24.960
And the crucial thing about this process of self-construction is that there is no magical

10:24.960 --> 10:30.800
sort of sharp red line at which point you go from being just physics to being a true

10:30.800 --> 10:32.120
cognitive being.

10:32.120 --> 10:36.840
So many people would like to look at themselves and say, we have true, you name it, sentience,

10:36.840 --> 10:40.240
cognition, intelligence, whatever term you want.

10:40.240 --> 10:44.560
And then they would look at something like this, which is a little blob of chemicals.

10:44.560 --> 10:47.040
And they say, well, that certainly doesn't have any of those things.

10:47.040 --> 10:51.280
And so then you owe a story of how you got from here to there.

10:51.280 --> 10:56.360
And that story cannot be any kind of a sharp change.

10:56.360 --> 11:02.160
It has to be a gradual process that is in concert with what we know about embryonic development

11:02.160 --> 11:03.660
and so on.

11:03.660 --> 11:04.660
So that's interesting.

11:04.660 --> 11:09.120
So we go from matter to mind in this way that I think developmental biology is maybe the

11:09.440 --> 11:11.680
most magical of the sciences.

11:11.680 --> 11:14.960
But at least we tend to think of ourselves, once we get here, we tend to think of ourselves

11:14.960 --> 11:19.240
as some sort of a unified intelligence.

11:19.240 --> 11:24.160
And in fact, we often, people will contrast the kinds of thing that we are with something

11:24.160 --> 11:29.760
like ant colonies or bee swarms or something like that and say, well, we talk about that

11:29.760 --> 11:32.640
as a collective intelligence, but that's a metaphor.

11:32.640 --> 11:36.520
We are a true intelligence, collective intelligence is something else.

11:36.520 --> 11:39.680
But actually, this is not the case.

11:39.680 --> 11:43.880
And so Descartes, for example, was really interested in the pineal gland because he said that the

11:43.880 --> 11:50.000
pineal gland was unique, it was an unpaired organ in the brain and therefore a kind of

11:50.000 --> 11:54.480
a singular unified location for the mind to interact with the body.

11:54.480 --> 11:58.160
But if he had had access to good microscopy, what he would have discovered is that there

11:58.160 --> 12:00.360
isn't one of anything in the brain.

12:00.360 --> 12:04.120
In fact, inside the pineal gland, you see this, which is a huge number of individual

12:04.120 --> 12:05.440
cells.

12:06.080 --> 12:09.680
If he had had this technology, he could have looked inside of any one of those cells and

12:09.680 --> 12:14.040
discovered that they, in fact, are made of a huge number of different components and

12:14.040 --> 12:15.440
various kinds of active matter.

12:15.440 --> 12:21.520
So there are mitochondria, there are little motors that zip up and down various filaments,

12:21.520 --> 12:23.760
just an incredible number of parts.

12:23.760 --> 12:27.360
And so all of us are collective intelligences.

12:27.360 --> 12:33.240
I'm not aware of any intelligence that is really just some sort of one indivisible diamond

12:33.240 --> 12:34.560
of mind.

12:34.560 --> 12:37.040
We are all made of parts of different kinds.

12:37.040 --> 12:39.600
And so this is the sort of thing we're made of.

12:39.600 --> 12:42.400
This is a single cell, it's called the lacrimaria.

12:42.400 --> 12:45.640
This is a unicellular organism.

12:45.640 --> 12:48.840
It has no brain, it has no nervous system, no stem cells.

12:48.840 --> 12:57.120
It has remarkable competencies over its physiological, metabolic, and anatomical goals.

12:57.120 --> 13:02.920
So you can see here that it's basically, this is at hunting in its environment.

13:02.920 --> 13:06.800
If you're into soft-body robotics, this is an amazing design challenge.

13:06.800 --> 13:10.760
We don't have anything remotely this competent.

13:10.760 --> 13:13.800
And cells have all kinds of other interesting capabilities.

13:13.800 --> 13:17.560
So this is the sort of thing that's studied in the field of diverse intelligence or basal

13:17.560 --> 13:18.560
cognition.

13:18.560 --> 13:20.680
I'll show you another example.

13:20.680 --> 13:22.600
This is a slime mold.

13:22.600 --> 13:26.560
So this slime mold, this is a unicellular slime mold called physarum polycephalum.

13:26.560 --> 13:29.120
And we've put a little bit of it here on this petri dish.

13:29.120 --> 13:31.240
We put one glass disc up here.

13:31.240 --> 13:33.080
We put three glass discs back here.

13:33.080 --> 13:34.080
They're just glass.

13:34.080 --> 13:35.080
They're completely inert.

13:35.080 --> 13:36.080
They're very thin.

13:36.080 --> 13:38.880
They have no food or any kind of a chemical substance on them.

13:38.880 --> 13:43.880
But what happens is that this, and by the way, this slime mold, it's a single cell.

13:43.880 --> 13:46.200
It can be very large, but the whole thing is a single cell.

13:46.200 --> 13:50.840
So what it starts to do is it starts to grow out, basically in every direction at once.

13:50.840 --> 13:56.000
But during this time, during these 600 minutes or so, what it's actually doing as we discovered

13:56.000 --> 14:00.600
is gently tugging on the material around it and reading the strain angle that comes

14:00.600 --> 14:01.600
back.

14:01.600 --> 14:07.120
And based on that strain angle, it builds up towards a decision of where the heavier

14:07.120 --> 14:08.280
mass is.

14:08.280 --> 14:11.720
And the way we know this is because reliably what it's going to do is grow towards the

14:11.720 --> 14:12.960
heavier mass.

14:12.960 --> 14:17.520
And so by reading that strain angle, it's able to gain some knowledge of its environment.

14:17.520 --> 14:22.360
And then for some reason that we don't know, it prefers moving towards the heavier masses.

14:22.360 --> 14:28.800
And so we see that we have this biological material that's very sort of ancient and early

14:28.800 --> 14:32.160
in life has interesting capabilities.

14:32.160 --> 14:37.040
And then the real question becomes, how do these things scale up?

14:37.040 --> 14:41.480
What is it that allows combinations of these cells to do something like this?

14:41.480 --> 14:44.760
So this is a very standard scenario.

14:44.760 --> 14:50.920
The rat learns to press the lever to get the reward, and that's sort of very well understood.

14:50.920 --> 14:56.600
But the interesting thing is that the rat is really a collection of cells, and no individual

14:56.600 --> 14:59.000
cell has both experiences.

14:59.000 --> 15:02.720
So there are cells on the foot of the rat that interact with the lever.

15:02.720 --> 15:08.440
There are cells in the intestine that collect the nutritious reward sometime later.

15:08.440 --> 15:13.000
But no individual cell has the experience of doing this and receiving that.

15:13.000 --> 15:18.360
And so who is it that owns this kind of associative memory between two events that no individual

15:18.360 --> 15:19.360
cell experienced?

15:19.360 --> 15:24.160
So clearly, you need some sort of a, and the standard answer, of course, is the nervous

15:24.160 --> 15:29.720
system provides this, you need some sort of way to integrate individual cellular activities

15:29.720 --> 15:31.720
towards a single being.

15:31.720 --> 15:33.600
Now this is kind of very common.

15:33.600 --> 15:39.560
I want to show you some uncommon examples that people don't hear about a lot to kind

15:39.560 --> 15:42.600
of stretch our idea of what's possible.

15:42.600 --> 15:49.160
So this is a caterpillar, a soft-bodied kind of creature that crawls around and eats leaves,

15:49.160 --> 15:51.320
and it has a certain kind of brain.

15:51.320 --> 15:55.320
Remarkably, it transforms itself into a completely different kind of creature that now lives

15:55.320 --> 15:56.680
in a three-dimensional world.

15:56.680 --> 16:00.040
It flies, and it doesn't like leaves anymore.

16:00.040 --> 16:01.040
It wants nectar.

16:01.040 --> 16:05.000
And so a very different set of behaviors, very different set of preferences, very different

16:05.000 --> 16:06.760
brain.

16:06.760 --> 16:10.640
The brain is actually largely dissolved during this metamorphosis process.

16:10.640 --> 16:14.600
The most of the synapses are broken, maybe most of the cells are killed, and a new brain

16:14.600 --> 16:15.920
is reassembled.

16:15.920 --> 16:22.560
But there's actually really good evidence that the memories that you impart onto the

16:22.560 --> 16:27.560
caterpillar that you train, the moth or butterfly will actually retain those memories, and there's

16:27.560 --> 16:31.840
work on this in beetles and various other creatures.

16:31.840 --> 16:33.720
So you can think about two things.

16:33.720 --> 16:38.960
The practical issue of, isn't it amazing to have a memory medium that can basically be

16:38.960 --> 16:44.320
taken apart and put back together and drastically rearranged and still retain its information

16:44.320 --> 16:45.320
content?

16:45.320 --> 16:50.480
Anything like that in computer science or anything like that.

16:50.480 --> 16:54.360
And of course, it raises some philosophical, interesting philosophical questions, which

16:54.360 --> 16:59.200
is, never mind the older question of what's it like to be a butterfly, the question could

16:59.200 --> 17:04.120
be posed, what's it like to be a caterpillar slowly changing into a butterfly?

17:04.120 --> 17:08.040
Because this is a change that happens not on an evolutionary time scale, but actually

17:08.040 --> 17:10.880
during the lifetime of an active individual.

17:10.880 --> 17:18.600
And so this ability to retain memory through very drastic deformations is really maximized

17:18.600 --> 17:21.640
by this other system known as planarian flatworms.

17:21.640 --> 17:23.880
We'll talk much more about that.

17:23.880 --> 17:30.520
And these planarian flatworms, they can be trained, and if you train them, for example,

17:30.520 --> 17:36.920
to recognize these little bumpy patterns as the place where they get fed, what you can

17:36.920 --> 17:42.400
then do is amputate their head, which contains their brain.

17:42.400 --> 17:46.840
You are left with a tail, the tail sits there doing nothing for about eight days.

17:46.840 --> 17:53.080
It slowly regrows a brand new head and McConnell, who discovered this in the 60s and got a lot

17:53.080 --> 17:57.720
of flak for it was actually completely correct in that these new animals with a brand new

17:57.720 --> 18:01.200
brain still remember that original information.

18:01.200 --> 18:06.480
And so what we have here is first evidence that information is not stored exclusively

18:06.480 --> 18:10.760
in their centralized brain, but actually apparently spread throughout the body.

18:10.760 --> 18:18.160
And you see this ability of those tissues to imprint that information onto the new brain

18:18.160 --> 18:19.160
as it develops.

18:19.160 --> 18:23.200
So this idea of information actually moving through body tissue.

18:23.200 --> 18:27.160
And so you can think about, you know, there's this malfunctioning transporter experiment

18:27.160 --> 18:30.560
from philosophy 101 where they say, well, there's this transporter.

18:30.560 --> 18:34.680
And so what it does is you step into it and it destroys the original body and recreates

18:34.680 --> 18:36.760
a molecule for molecule copy somewhere else.

18:36.760 --> 18:40.600
And so now you've you've transported, but what if it malfunctions and it doesn't erase

18:40.600 --> 18:41.600
the original copy?

18:41.600 --> 18:42.600
How many of you are there?

18:42.600 --> 18:47.080
Well, in Plenaria, you can literally do that because you can cut them into into pieces,

18:47.080 --> 18:51.080
many pieces, and each piece becomes a perfect little little worm.

18:51.080 --> 18:57.080
So so so we start to see that that, you know, kind of the common workhorses of behavioral

18:57.080 --> 19:01.480
science and cognitive neuroscience or rats and things like this are just the tip of the

19:01.480 --> 19:02.480
iceberg.

19:02.480 --> 19:07.280
And there are many interesting phenomena that speak to this question of what are cells,

19:07.280 --> 19:13.320
what are integrated beings, what what's information, how does it move through the body invertebrates.

19:13.320 --> 19:15.600
You see this kind of interesting plasticity.

19:15.600 --> 19:19.240
So this is a tappel of the frog, Xenopus labus.

19:19.240 --> 19:22.520
And here are the nostrils, here's the brain, here's the gut.

19:22.520 --> 19:24.600
And what you'll notice is that there aren't any eyes.

19:24.600 --> 19:26.600
We prevented these eyes from forming.

19:26.600 --> 19:31.000
But what we did do is graft a an eye primordium onto the tail.

19:31.000 --> 19:34.280
And so these cells actually make a perfectly good eye.

19:34.280 --> 19:37.920
And not only do they make an eye, but they make an optic nerve that optic nerve comes

19:37.920 --> 19:41.640
out and you can see what it's doing here, it's it doesn't go to the brain, it stops

19:41.640 --> 19:44.080
here at synapses onto the spinal cord.

19:44.080 --> 19:48.960
And we made this machine that automates the training and testing of these animals and

19:48.960 --> 19:50.840
visual cues.

19:50.840 --> 19:55.920
So what so what we find is that they can see they can see quite well actually, and despite

19:55.920 --> 20:00.960
the fact that they have a radically different sensory motor architecture, it does not require

20:01.160 --> 20:03.680
evolutionary adaptation time.

20:03.680 --> 20:09.360
This happens immediately in one in one lifetime of a single tappel, and they can do perfectly

20:09.360 --> 20:13.880
well with a completely different kind of connection between their sense organs and their brain.

20:13.880 --> 20:20.200
And this this kind of thing has massive implications for evolution, too, because some, for example,

20:20.200 --> 20:25.040
a mutation that causes their their eye to be to be pushed off doesn't immediately get

20:25.040 --> 20:30.560
weeded out because the animals can't see and die, but rather these animals, the behavior

20:30.640 --> 20:31.480
is quite robust.

20:31.480 --> 20:35.880
And so the evolution is free to explore any other consequence of that same mutation.

20:35.880 --> 20:42.400
It really buffers this this competency really buffers the negative consequences of of mutations.

20:43.120 --> 20:49.000
So what we see the reason the reason that all of this plasticity works is that biology

20:49.240 --> 20:54.440
is built on this kind of multi scale competency architecture where all the way from molecular

20:54.440 --> 20:58.400
networks, cellular networks of tissues and organs and so on.

20:59.040 --> 21:04.920
Every level here is not merely a structural set of nested dolls, but is actually a functional

21:04.920 --> 21:05.880
problem solver.

21:05.880 --> 21:09.120
In other words, they are competent, they have competencies in specific spaces.

21:09.360 --> 21:12.720
This might be the space of gene expression or transcriptional space.

21:12.920 --> 21:14.720
This might be physiological space.

21:14.720 --> 21:17.680
This might be familiar three dimensional behavioral space and so on.

21:18.360 --> 21:23.040
And so each of these levels solves various problems at various degrees of sophistication.

21:23.440 --> 21:30.000
And so what I'd like to do is really expand from from this notion that behavior takes

21:30.000 --> 21:36.880
place in three dimensional space and and and understand that that to biology, all kinds

21:36.880 --> 21:42.920
of other spaces that we are not good at perceiving and thinking about those are equally valid

21:43.160 --> 21:44.280
problem spaces.

21:44.280 --> 21:50.280
So we this this this familiar space of behavior, we are very good at recognizing

21:50.640 --> 21:56.600
intelligence when medium sized beings moving at medium speeds through three dimensional

21:56.600 --> 21:59.560
space are doing clever things and we and we recognize that right away.

22:00.320 --> 22:03.640
But there are these other spaces that we are not good at, for example, gene expression

22:03.640 --> 22:05.080
space and physiological space.

22:05.360 --> 22:11.200
I think that if we had a built in kind of innate ability to feel our blood chemistry,

22:11.200 --> 22:16.360
for example, if we had sensors sensors pointing inwards, not just not just outwards, I think

22:16.360 --> 22:20.840
we would have no trouble recognizing our liver and our kidneys as intelligent beings

22:20.840 --> 22:25.120
navigating physiological problem space and solving various problems, the way that we

22:25.120 --> 22:26.800
recognize other animals doing it.

22:27.200 --> 22:32.440
And so I'm going to spend the most of the time in the next section talking about this

22:32.440 --> 22:34.720
problem solving in this anatomical morphospace.

22:35.000 --> 22:39.520
But I just want to show you one interesting example of a different kind of space called

22:39.520 --> 22:40.640
physiological space.

22:41.080 --> 22:44.800
So here's here's an experiment we we showed a couple of years ago.

22:45.080 --> 22:46.360
So so here's a flatworm.

22:46.360 --> 22:49.360
You put these flatworms in a solution of barium.

22:49.640 --> 22:52.920
Now, barium is a nonspecific potassium channel blocker.

22:52.920 --> 22:56.880
So what it does is it blocks the ability of the cells to swap potassium in and out.

22:57.960 --> 23:02.000
The cells are very unhappy, especially the cells in the head, because all these neurons

23:02.000 --> 23:06.280
like to flow potassium in order to keep their physiology correct.

23:06.520 --> 23:10.600
And so what happens is their heads explode literally overnight, their heads, their heads

23:10.600 --> 23:11.600
degenerate.

23:11.640 --> 23:15.040
But the amazing thing is that if you leave them in barium within a couple of weeks,

23:15.240 --> 23:18.800
they grow back a new head and the new head doesn't care about barium at all.

23:18.880 --> 23:20.600
No problem. It's barium adapted.

23:20.600 --> 23:22.640
So we asked we asked a simple question.

23:23.160 --> 23:24.880
What is different transcriptionally?

23:24.880 --> 23:28.880
What genes do these barium adapted heads express that the standard heads do not

23:28.880 --> 23:31.920
express? And what we found out is that there's very small number on the order of

23:31.920 --> 23:36.880
about a dozen genes that are that are changed here to go to become barium adapted.

23:37.120 --> 23:39.200
Now, here's the here's the kicker to all of this.

23:39.840 --> 23:41.960
Plenaria never see barium in the wild.

23:42.200 --> 23:47.280
This barium doesn't exist in nature in the way that the way that we used it here.

23:47.440 --> 23:51.240
And so there's never been evolutionary pressure for Plenaria to know what to do

23:51.240 --> 23:54.080
when they've been exposed to this incredible stressor.

23:54.520 --> 23:59.520
So when you think about how they found these few

23:59.960 --> 24:03.120
correct genes out of a sea of tens of thousands of other genes,

24:03.760 --> 24:08.160
it's a little bit like I visualize it like sitting in a in a nuclear reactor

24:08.160 --> 24:10.320
control room and things melting down.

24:11.120 --> 24:13.480
So you have this this very strong physiological stressor,

24:13.640 --> 24:16.400
which you don't have time to do is to start randomly flipping buttons.

24:16.640 --> 24:19.000
And so because not not only because there's no time for that,

24:19.000 --> 24:22.720
it's the combinations are astronomical, but also because

24:23.400 --> 24:26.520
because many of the things you do this way are going to kill the cell

24:26.520 --> 24:31.440
along before you find the the barium adaptation region of that space.

24:31.440 --> 24:37.200
So so it's so it's a surge of a roughly 20,000 dimensional space

24:37.440 --> 24:41.000
to find a new region of that space that solves your problem.

24:41.000 --> 24:44.480
This is this is absolutely a kind of navigating problem solving

24:44.480 --> 24:46.720
that we really do not understand how this works.

24:46.720 --> 24:48.520
But this is an example of what I mean.

24:48.520 --> 24:53.160
And I think that what evolution does is pivot some of the same

24:53.920 --> 24:56.360
mechanisms and some of the same tricks and the same problem

24:56.600 --> 25:00.640
problems, problem solving strategies through various spaces,

25:00.640 --> 25:04.040
including very early life, I have to solve metabolic problems

25:04.200 --> 25:07.400
and then and then some physiological problems and then gene expression

25:07.400 --> 25:09.280
and then anatomical morphous space.

25:09.280 --> 25:13.200
And of course, 3D behavioral space once brains and muscles showed up

25:13.400 --> 25:16.520
and then linguistic space and who knows who knows what else.

25:17.080 --> 25:22.800
So what evolution does is is is is pivot organisms through these various spaces.

25:22.800 --> 25:25.320
And of course, even the distinction between these spaces

25:25.320 --> 25:28.440
is completely arbitrary relative to us and as an observer.

25:28.760 --> 25:30.880
So as, for example, Chris Fields points out,

25:31.240 --> 25:36.080
if you are a bacterium sitting in a in the concentration gradient

25:36.080 --> 25:39.840
of some nutrient, you could move in three dimensional space

25:39.840 --> 25:44.360
to try to go up up the gradient, or you could move in transcriptional space,

25:44.560 --> 25:47.680
turn on some other gene that would let you instead metabolize

25:48.080 --> 25:51.800
some other kind of molecule that's in that space and solve your problem that way.

25:51.800 --> 25:55.760
So to the to the bacterium, it will not see a clean separation

25:55.760 --> 25:58.000
between three dimensional space and transcriptional space.

25:58.240 --> 25:59.880
All of these things are effectors.

25:59.880 --> 26:04.440
All of these things are moves that it can make in its various spaces to solve problems.

26:05.360 --> 26:10.760
OK, so let's so let's take a break here before we go on to the next section.

26:11.640 --> 26:16.440
And I'll pause and and if anybody has questions, I'm happy to happy to talk about it.

26:18.440 --> 26:21.520
Oh, how long would you like this this break to be?

26:22.720 --> 26:26.200
Um, let's take let's take maybe five minutes, five minutes.

26:26.440 --> 26:28.040
Yeah, if people have questions, great.

26:28.040 --> 26:30.240
And if not, just take five minutes and get some water.

26:30.800 --> 26:34.920
Yeah, if you do have any question, you can use the raise your hand function

26:34.920 --> 26:38.320
or or just come in if if I don't see you.

26:39.360 --> 26:41.120
I see that Gary has.

26:42.560 --> 26:44.320
He's had a couple of questions there in the chat.

26:44.320 --> 26:46.760
I don't know if he wants to come in and ask his questions.

26:48.320 --> 26:50.760
Gary, let me unmute. Can you hear me?

26:51.320 --> 26:54.320
We can. OK.

26:55.280 --> 27:00.080
Well, first of all, I think your work is just amazing and magnificent.

27:00.440 --> 27:02.440
And it's

27:03.480 --> 27:08.320
I just love the idea of a plenarium, you know, regenerating its head.

27:08.320 --> 27:11.480
I mean, that that you showed that McConnell was right about what he.

27:11.960 --> 27:14.800
So here's the thing.

27:14.800 --> 27:19.680
Does what you are seeing suggest the possibility

27:20.680 --> 27:26.160
that panpsychism is what is driving the material adaptation,

27:27.040 --> 27:31.720
that there is a fundamental consciousness

27:32.400 --> 27:39.040
that, you know, that then drives the adaptation of the of the material elements.

27:39.560 --> 27:42.560
Yeah, so there are no, please keep keep going.

27:42.960 --> 27:46.480
No, and the concept of also of semiotic freedom,

27:46.920 --> 27:50.600
which Jesper Hoffmeyer has talked about, which is the idea that

27:51.240 --> 27:56.200
that evolution favors the capacity to communicate, right?

27:56.440 --> 28:03.240
That that the more sophisticated the communication can be that integrates, right?

28:03.480 --> 28:07.680
The species within its body, but also within its

28:08.000 --> 28:10.440
conspecifics, right, within its community,

28:12.360 --> 28:14.640
which might explain why we're here.

28:14.720 --> 28:17.280
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, great, great questions.

28:17.280 --> 28:18.520
Thank you.

28:18.520 --> 28:22.760
There are to me, there are two different dimensions to this to this question.

28:23.280 --> 28:26.360
One is overall the concept of panpsychism.

28:26.360 --> 28:29.200
And I think what wait, if you would wait till the very end,

28:29.200 --> 28:31.560
and we'll talk about this after the third part.

28:31.840 --> 28:35.880
But the other interesting part you said is is about the driving of evolution.

28:36.200 --> 28:39.960
So so I'll just I'll just say one one one thing about it here,

28:40.280 --> 28:48.080
which is that if you think about the kind of pre Darwinian notion of

28:48.520 --> 28:51.880
what what people call whether they associate this with with Lamarck, most of all,

28:51.880 --> 28:56.880
but this idea that that evolutionary change is not random with respect to outcome

28:57.040 --> 29:01.560
that basically by stretching, you know, his neck, the giraffe has children with longer necks.

29:01.560 --> 29:08.040
OK, the problem with the up until 2018,

29:08.400 --> 29:10.480
I would have said that I would have said the following.

29:11.160 --> 29:14.840
The reason that Lamarckism is a strong Lamarckism, of course, of course,

29:14.840 --> 29:19.720
and there's some some mechanisms for for epigenetic inheritance and so on.

29:19.720 --> 29:23.000
But the reason that strong Lamarckism is impossible is has nothing to do

29:23.000 --> 29:25.280
with Weissman's barrier or setting aside the germline.

29:25.280 --> 29:26.640
All of that is completely porous.

29:26.640 --> 29:29.680
People have shown that that doesn't stop any man that that's that's easy.

29:30.000 --> 29:33.400
The hard part and prior to 2018, I would have said impossible

29:33.840 --> 29:38.240
is that the real problem is that genes don't encode specific characters.

29:38.240 --> 29:39.960
In other words, there's no gene for neck length.

29:39.960 --> 29:44.000
And so if you wanted a longer neck, you have to solve this inverse problem

29:44.000 --> 29:47.280
of which genes do you mutate to have a longer neck?

29:47.280 --> 29:49.800
It's, you know, it's it's an it's an impossible inverse problem.

29:49.800 --> 29:51.360
So I would have said that's impossible.

29:51.360 --> 29:55.520
However, looking at this looking at this barium experiment,

29:55.880 --> 29:59.520
what we see here is that the cells have basically done the hardest part.

29:59.680 --> 30:04.040
They have identified which which genetic loci are relevant to the new problem

30:04.040 --> 30:04.880
they're facing.

30:04.880 --> 30:08.440
Once you've identified which those are mutating them by some kind of crisper

30:08.720 --> 30:11.680
type of mechanism or some kind of genomic editing mechanism, that's trivial.

30:11.680 --> 30:15.080
There are lots of lots of organisms to edit their genomes in various ways.

30:15.520 --> 30:16.800
Once you know which genes.

30:16.800 --> 30:21.040
And so, you know, now I have a slightly different view on it to say that

30:21.200 --> 30:25.640
I don't know how they do it, but we do have some evidence that cells can infer

30:25.640 --> 30:29.760
which genes are responsible for specific adaptive outcomes.

30:30.080 --> 30:33.160
And if that's the case, I'm no longer sure that it's impossible

30:33.160 --> 30:35.960
that that to some extent they're driving the evolutionary change.

30:36.160 --> 30:39.720
Because once you and again, this is a very, of course, this is a very controversial area.

30:39.840 --> 30:43.680
I have not, you know, remotely enough evidence yet to prove that that's

30:44.080 --> 30:48.080
that that has implications on a on a global evolutionary trajectory scale.

30:48.240 --> 30:52.480
But I no longer think it's impossible because we can see cells solving this inverse problem.

30:53.080 --> 30:56.880
I mean, it suggests that there's some form of entanglement, right?

30:56.880 --> 31:01.400
I mean, which is which we know is true in quantum physics.

31:03.000 --> 31:06.800
Even though, you know, we don't have a material way of explaining it.

31:09.200 --> 31:13.720
That is that the that the problem solving element is not is not necessarily based

31:13.720 --> 31:20.600
on the materiality of the genome adapting, but that there's some kind of

31:20.600 --> 31:26.000
an influence that comes from the functional need to survive, right?

31:26.000 --> 31:31.880
To, you know, to to change itself so that it can sustain itself

31:32.480 --> 31:35.120
as a living creature in a barium solution.

31:36.720 --> 31:37.520
Yeah. Yeah.

31:37.520 --> 31:40.120
I mean, so I haven't shown you anything yet.

31:40.120 --> 31:44.000
There are some things coming that that may relate to this, but I haven't shown you

31:44.000 --> 31:48.560
anything yet that suggests that the solution has to be any kind of exorbitant.

31:48.560 --> 31:52.760
But the solution has to be any kind of exotic, you know, physics or anything

31:52.760 --> 31:56.960
like that, right? Because because for now, for the next for the whole next section,

31:56.960 --> 32:02.040
which we should start in a few minutes, what you'll see is that there's a tremendous

32:02.040 --> 32:05.920
amount of intelligent problem solving that can be squeezed out of a perfectly

32:05.920 --> 32:09.000
conventional set of mechanisms, not to say that there aren't others.

32:09.240 --> 32:13.240
But but we haven't yet, I think, come to the point where we need to invoke

32:13.240 --> 32:14.400
anything more, more exotic.

32:14.400 --> 32:16.280
But, you know, we'll see.

32:16.280 --> 32:17.680
OK. Thank you.

32:17.720 --> 32:20.880
You, Gary, there are a few more questions, Mike.

32:20.880 --> 32:22.360
Are you happy to take them?

32:22.360 --> 32:24.600
Let's yeah, let's do let's do let's say one more.

32:24.600 --> 32:27.840
And then and then, you know, at the end, I'll stay as long as people want afterwards.

32:27.840 --> 32:30.400
But, you know, let's we'll move on to the second section.

32:30.400 --> 32:31.400
Thank you.

32:31.400 --> 32:34.520
Beth, do you have a question?

32:34.520 --> 32:35.880
Yes.

32:35.880 --> 32:39.360
And like Gary, I want to just say this is this absolutely fascinating.

32:39.680 --> 32:42.120
But unlike Gary, I'm not a scientist.

32:42.120 --> 32:44.240
So this is probably naive.

32:44.320 --> 32:48.080
I'm trying to bring together an idea from the very first of what you said

32:48.520 --> 32:49.760
and what you said at the end.

32:49.760 --> 32:53.480
And that has to do with the scale and the continuum.

32:54.720 --> 32:58.800
I'm curious, you know, thinking about human beings or higher critters

32:59.320 --> 33:02.800
that we have an awful lot of diverse things within us.

33:02.800 --> 33:07.560
And I'm just curious if we don't have a lot of that

33:07.960 --> 33:12.680
what you call the physical space, the continuum that goes across time,

33:12.680 --> 33:14.800
the evolutionary time.

33:14.800 --> 33:21.000
We must be just a polyglot of different levels of evolutionary development.

33:21.200 --> 33:22.480
Is that so?

33:22.480 --> 33:26.840
Yes, yes, you've you've anticipated a chunk of the third part of the talk.

33:26.840 --> 33:28.720
Yeah, you stay tuned.

33:28.720 --> 33:31.280
That's coming. You are 100 percent on the money there.

33:31.440 --> 33:33.560
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, it's coming.

33:34.080 --> 33:37.200
OK, so yeah, let me let me move on to the second part.

33:37.200 --> 33:40.680
And then we will, well, you know, we can come back to any of this.

33:40.920 --> 33:44.360
So the second the second thing that I want to talk about is to really give you

33:44.360 --> 33:50.480
an example, a very concrete example of a of an unconventional

33:50.480 --> 33:53.800
collective intelligence of a of a of a problem solving system

33:53.800 --> 33:57.280
that doesn't look like what we're used to thinking about as intelligent systems.

33:57.520 --> 33:59.080
And what we're going to use for that example

33:59.080 --> 34:03.280
is is the distributed collective intelligence of cells

34:03.280 --> 34:05.040
as they undergo morphogenesis.

34:05.040 --> 34:07.160
And then specifically, we'll talk about bio electricity.

34:08.000 --> 34:11.480
So let's I like to start by noticing this interesting thing.

34:11.480 --> 34:14.280
So so Alan Turing obviously needs no introduction,

34:14.560 --> 34:17.600
kind of the father of computer science and some other things.

34:18.080 --> 34:21.720
And he was interested in intelligence and intelligence

34:21.720 --> 34:24.920
in novel embodiments that are not natural

34:25.200 --> 34:27.560
and computation and things like this.

34:27.560 --> 34:29.840
And so he was interested in problem solving machines,

34:30.040 --> 34:32.560
and in particular, the notion of reprogrammability

34:32.560 --> 34:35.720
or intelligence through a kind of plasticity.

34:36.720 --> 34:39.080
Interesting. And so and so he, you know,

34:39.080 --> 34:41.440
he wrote these foundational papers and computer science.

34:41.760 --> 34:45.000
But interestingly, he also wrote a paper on this

34:45.000 --> 34:47.000
on the chemical basis of morphogenesis.

34:47.000 --> 34:51.680
So the question he was addressing is how can biological order

34:51.720 --> 34:56.240
or at least in this case, biochemical order arise spontaneously?

34:56.440 --> 35:00.760
And so you might wonder why would somebody who is interested in computing

35:00.760 --> 35:04.040
and mathematics and machines, machine intelligence,

35:04.280 --> 35:06.960
why would he be thinking about chemical morphogenesis

35:06.960 --> 35:08.760
and embryos and things like this?

35:08.760 --> 35:11.200
And I think that like with many things,

35:11.200 --> 35:12.960
this is just an example of Turing's genius.

35:12.960 --> 35:16.640
I think he saw very clearly that these are fundamentally the same problem.

35:16.640 --> 35:18.680
And I'm going to argue that that's true,

35:18.680 --> 35:22.520
although he didn't write much, if anything, about this that I know of.

35:22.520 --> 35:26.640
But I think he was onto this idea that the formation of the mind

35:26.640 --> 35:29.360
and the formation of the body are fundamentally the same problem.

35:29.360 --> 35:32.520
And so let me take you on a little tour of some of that.

35:32.960 --> 35:34.440
So let's let's ask this question.

35:34.440 --> 35:38.040
This is a this is a cross section through a human torso.

35:39.440 --> 35:42.280
Look at look at the amazing order here, right?

35:42.280 --> 35:46.080
So all the organs, the cells, the tissues, everything is in the right

35:46.080 --> 35:49.720
the right size, the right shape or next to the right thing oriented in the right direction.

35:50.840 --> 35:55.080
And it all comes from a collection of embryonic blastomeres during development.

35:55.080 --> 35:56.360
And it's a self assembly.

35:56.360 --> 35:59.080
Where does this particular pattern come from?

35:59.320 --> 36:03.560
Now, the kind of immediate answer that most people give, well, it's in the DNA.

36:03.560 --> 36:05.040
It's in the genome.

36:05.040 --> 36:08.440
And we're going to come back to this with a vengeance in the third part of the talk.

36:08.440 --> 36:13.960
But I want to point out already here that that is kind of an untenable answer

36:13.960 --> 36:18.520
because we can read genomes now and we know what what genomes encode.

36:18.520 --> 36:19.840
They encode proteins.

36:19.840 --> 36:22.680
They don't specifically encode three dimensional shapes.

36:22.680 --> 36:26.680
They encode the tiny hardware that every cell gets to have.

36:26.680 --> 36:31.080
And so there's still this this this massive question of using that hardware.

36:31.080 --> 36:34.600
How does the physiology of this cellular machine

36:35.960 --> 36:38.920
make this particular pattern and not some other pattern?

36:38.920 --> 36:43.400
And the thing is that the structure of the human body is no more directly in the genome

36:43.400 --> 36:49.000
than the structure of a termite nest or the shape of a spider web is in the genomes of the

36:49.000 --> 36:52.200
of the termites or the spider web.

36:52.200 --> 36:57.960
It's an emergent construction project of the collective intelligence of these cells.

36:57.960 --> 36:59.880
And so we can ask interesting questions.

36:59.880 --> 37:02.920
How do these cells know what to make and when to stop?

37:02.920 --> 37:07.080
And then for the third part of the talk, we'll talk about what else is possible

37:07.080 --> 37:09.880
as an as a regenerative medicine worker.

37:09.880 --> 37:14.760
We'd like to know if a part is damaged or missing, how do we get the cells to rebuild it?

37:14.760 --> 37:18.440
And as an engineer, we'd like to go one step further and say, OK, but can we get these cells

37:18.440 --> 37:21.560
to build something completely different, something that's not like this at all?

37:21.560 --> 37:27.320
And to think about, I like to sort of think all the way forward so that we know where we're going.

37:27.320 --> 37:29.800
Let's think about what is the end game of this field?

37:29.800 --> 37:33.800
You know, when can we all basically say we're done and go home?

37:33.800 --> 37:39.400
And the way I envision this is as something called an anatomical compiler.

37:39.400 --> 37:43.160
So just imagine at some point in the future, you're going to be able to sit down in front

37:43.160 --> 37:47.640
of a computer and draw the plant or animal that you want.

37:47.640 --> 37:49.560
It could be something that already exists.

37:49.560 --> 37:52.040
It could be some organ that you need for transplantation.

37:52.040 --> 37:55.480
It could be some completely different thing, you know, some sort of a six-legged frog

37:55.480 --> 37:56.840
with a little propeller on its head.

37:56.840 --> 37:57.560
It could be anything.

37:57.560 --> 38:00.120
The point is it could be absolutely anything.

38:00.120 --> 38:03.560
And if we had a mature science of this, if we knew what we were doing,

38:03.560 --> 38:08.760
this anatomical compiler would output a set of stimuli that would have to be given to cells

38:08.760 --> 38:13.000
to get them to build whatever you drew, like in this case, this three-headed flatwork.

38:13.000 --> 38:15.480
And so the idea, this is not a 3D printer.

38:15.480 --> 38:21.800
This is not something that meticulously micromanages the position of cells to print what you want.

38:21.800 --> 38:23.800
This is a communications device.

38:23.800 --> 38:26.600
What it does is it's a translator, really.

38:26.600 --> 38:32.360
It translates from your anatomical goals to the anatomical goals of a collection of cells,

38:32.360 --> 38:35.480
which are encoded in a different medium, which I'll show you momentarily.

38:36.280 --> 38:44.040
And by doing that, it basically resets the target morphology of these cells

38:44.040 --> 38:46.680
and gets them to build whatever it is that you want them to build.

38:46.680 --> 38:48.200
And I'll show you some examples of that.

38:48.200 --> 38:52.440
But of course, we don't have anything remotely this sophisticated.

38:52.440 --> 38:54.920
We can only do this in a very small number of cases.

38:54.920 --> 38:56.360
Now, why is this important?

38:56.360 --> 39:02.280
Well, aside from the very fundamental aspect that we need this to understand how evolution works,

39:02.280 --> 39:08.840
we needed to understand our origins, and so on, this is the answer to most medical problems,

39:08.840 --> 39:11.080
with the exception of infectious disease.

39:11.080 --> 39:14.680
If you could communicate your goals to a collection of cells,

39:14.680 --> 39:17.320
you would immediately have the solution to birth defects.

39:17.320 --> 39:19.160
You could regenerate after traumatic injury.

39:19.160 --> 39:20.840
You could reprogram and cancer.

39:20.840 --> 39:21.960
You could suppress aging.

39:21.960 --> 39:26.840
You could solve degenerative disease.

39:26.840 --> 39:29.000
All of these things boil down to one problem.

39:29.000 --> 39:31.320
How do we tell a collection of cells what to build?

39:31.320 --> 39:33.400
If you knew that, all of these problems would go away.

39:33.400 --> 39:35.800
So this is a major unmet need.

39:35.800 --> 39:37.320
Why do we not have something like this?

39:37.400 --> 39:42.680
I mean, genetics and molecular biology have been working really hard for many decades now.

39:42.680 --> 39:44.360
Why do we not still have this?

39:44.360 --> 39:46.840
I want to show just a simple example.

39:48.040 --> 39:52.200
This is a baby axolotl, and axolotl larvae have little forelegs.

39:52.200 --> 39:57.640
And this is a tadpole of a frog, and these guys do not have forelegs.

39:57.640 --> 40:00.280
And so in my lab, we can make something called a frogolotl,

40:00.280 --> 40:03.880
which basically just means you take a bunch of cells from an early axolotl.

40:03.880 --> 40:05.880
You take a bunch of cells from the early frog.

40:05.960 --> 40:08.120
You put them together, and you got a chimeric embryo

40:08.120 --> 40:10.680
that has some cells from here and some cells from there.

40:11.400 --> 40:13.640
Now, we have both genomes.

40:13.640 --> 40:17.240
We've sequenced the axolotl genome, and we've sequenced the frog genome.

40:17.240 --> 40:19.160
Can anybody tell me, looking at those genomes,

40:19.160 --> 40:21.800
whether frogolotls are going to have legs or not?

40:21.800 --> 40:22.600
And the answer is no.

40:22.600 --> 40:23.720
No one can tell you that.

40:23.720 --> 40:30.360
And that is because while we do have some good frameworks for understanding

40:30.360 --> 40:35.240
what a single cell is going to do biochemically by looking at its genome,

40:35.240 --> 40:38.520
we have almost no ability to look at a genome

40:38.520 --> 40:40.680
and guess what the collective is going to do.

40:40.680 --> 40:42.360
Either a pure collective like this,

40:42.360 --> 40:45.960
I mean, you can't even predict the shape of a single animal from its genome either,

40:45.960 --> 40:48.280
but certainly not in these chimeric cases.

40:48.280 --> 40:52.760
What we do not understand yet, despite all the biochemistry and genomics and everything else,

40:52.760 --> 40:55.240
what we don't understand yet is collective decision-making.

40:55.240 --> 40:57.880
We do not understand how cells with specific hardware

40:57.880 --> 41:00.360
make decisions about large-scale shape.

41:00.360 --> 41:02.360
And so here's where we are today.

41:02.360 --> 41:06.920
We're very good at manipulating molecules in cells and making networks and so on,

41:06.920 --> 41:09.800
but we're really a long way from form and function.

41:09.800 --> 41:13.240
And I'm going to argue that from controlling large-scale form and function.

41:13.240 --> 41:14.920
And I'm going to argue that the reason for this,

41:14.920 --> 41:18.840
and the thing that holds back really radically transformative regenerative medicine,

41:19.480 --> 41:24.360
is that all of molecular medicine today is roughly like this.

41:24.360 --> 41:27.640
This is what programming looked like in the 40s and 50s.

41:27.640 --> 41:29.240
I mean, you can see what she's doing.

41:29.240 --> 41:33.960
She's literally rewiring the machine by pulling wires in and out.

41:33.960 --> 41:35.480
This is hardware control.

41:35.480 --> 41:39.080
Now, the reason that you don't get out your soldering iron

41:39.080 --> 41:43.560
when it's time to go from Microsoft Word to Photoshop on your laptop

41:43.560 --> 41:47.800
is that what computer science has figured out is that there are higher-level

41:48.680 --> 41:52.680
ways to interact with the system that does not require you to rewire the hardware,

41:52.680 --> 41:58.280
meaning that you're taking advantage of the inherent plasticity competencies

41:58.280 --> 42:02.200
and various other capacities in the software of the system,

42:02.200 --> 42:05.640
in the activity of the system that you can guide with stimuli,

42:05.640 --> 42:09.000
with signals such as hitting a keyboard in the case of the computer.

42:09.000 --> 42:11.720
And that's what gave us the information technology revolution.

42:11.720 --> 42:17.000
Biology, to a large extent, is still here because all of the exciting technology,

42:17.000 --> 42:21.400
so genome editing, CRISPR, protein engineering, single molecule approaches,

42:21.400 --> 42:23.160
all of it is down at the level of the hardware.

42:23.160 --> 42:25.000
All the excitement is at the level of hardware.

42:25.000 --> 42:29.320
We haven't even begun to scratch the surface of what the actual biological

42:29.320 --> 42:34.920
software can do specifically, the intelligence of the various biological components.

42:34.920 --> 42:37.400
Now, what do I mean by, when I say intelligence?

42:37.400 --> 42:38.360
There are many definitions.

42:38.360 --> 42:39.080
I like this one.

42:39.720 --> 42:44.840
This is William James, who gave us a strikingly prescient definition of intelligence.

42:45.560 --> 42:48.600
It's very good because it doesn't say anything about brains or what you're made of

42:48.600 --> 42:49.640
or anything like that.

42:49.640 --> 42:51.080
It's very cybernetic.

42:51.080 --> 42:54.920
It says this, intelligence is some degree of the ability

42:55.320 --> 42:57.880
to reach the same goal by different means.

42:57.880 --> 42:58.600
That's it.

42:58.600 --> 43:01.320
So in order to estimate the intelligence of some system,

43:01.320 --> 43:04.600
whether it's engineered or biological or hybrid,

43:04.600 --> 43:06.280
you have to, it's an empirical question.

43:06.280 --> 43:08.120
You have to name a space that it works in.

43:08.120 --> 43:10.040
You have to say what you think the goal is.

43:10.040 --> 43:13.080
You have to make a claim about what you think the competencies of the system

43:13.080 --> 43:15.640
to reach that goal, despite perturbations.

43:15.640 --> 43:18.440
That's the key is that it's a, you need to do interventions.

43:18.440 --> 43:21.480
You can't say how intelligent something is by simply observing it.

43:21.480 --> 43:25.400
You have to do perturbative experiments to see what goes on

43:25.400 --> 43:28.040
and what it can do to achieve its goal.

43:28.040 --> 43:30.520
And in particular, James gives a very nice example,

43:30.520 --> 43:35.240
which is the spectrum between two magnets trying to get together

43:35.240 --> 43:37.960
and Romeo and Juliet trying to get together.

43:37.960 --> 43:39.720
And the difference is very simple.

43:39.720 --> 43:40.920
And there's many things in between.

43:40.920 --> 43:44.440
If you've got two magnets, they have some competency to try and meet each other.

43:44.440 --> 43:47.400
But if you put a piece of wood in their way, that's it.

43:47.400 --> 43:49.000
They're going to stand there pressed up against it.

43:49.000 --> 43:51.160
They have no ability to go around or do anything else.

43:51.160 --> 43:53.320
So that's sort of the minimal competency.

43:53.320 --> 43:55.560
Romeo and Juliet have massive competencies

43:55.560 --> 43:59.240
to go around various physical and social barriers to get what they want.

43:59.240 --> 44:04.840
And in between, there are all sorts of self-driving vehicles, worms and cells

44:04.840 --> 44:09.240
and different kinds of creatures that have different degrees of competency

44:09.240 --> 44:10.840
to reach various goals.

44:10.840 --> 44:12.520
So let's talk about this then.

44:12.520 --> 44:14.360
If that's the definition of intelligence,

44:15.160 --> 44:19.000
let's ask what kind of collective intelligence do these cellular swarms deploy?

44:19.000 --> 44:23.560
I've made this argument that the cells of the body making in embryo

44:23.560 --> 44:25.080
are a kind of collective intelligence.

44:25.800 --> 44:30.600
I'm not simply saying that they have a complex outcome.

44:30.600 --> 44:34.120
Feed forward emergence of complexity from simple rules is commonplace.

44:34.120 --> 44:35.000
Many systems do that.

44:35.000 --> 44:35.880
That's not what I mean.

44:35.880 --> 44:39.960
They have a specific ability to adapt to perturbations.

44:39.960 --> 44:42.200
That's more than simple emergence.

44:42.200 --> 44:43.800
And let me show you some examples.

44:43.800 --> 44:50.840
So development is quite reliable and has the ability to reach the specific region

44:50.840 --> 44:55.560
of the anatomical amorphous space, meaning the various different configurations

44:55.560 --> 44:58.040
that a body might have to go from here to here.

44:58.040 --> 45:02.760
So you go from a single cell and then two cells to a whole body.

45:02.760 --> 45:07.240
But the amazing thing is that if you cut this embryo in half,

45:07.240 --> 45:09.160
you don't get two half bodies.

45:09.160 --> 45:12.200
You get two perfectly normal monosygotic twins.

45:12.200 --> 45:14.840
So this system is reliable, but it is not hardwired.

45:14.840 --> 45:19.640
In the face of this massive perturbation, it is able to still get to where it's going.

45:19.640 --> 45:23.400
So if you boil everything down to two dimensions, just for sake of illustration,

45:23.400 --> 45:27.320
the normal embryo does this, but the embryo cut in half,

45:27.320 --> 45:29.480
which is in a different location in that space,

45:29.480 --> 45:31.480
actually is able to get to where it needs to go.

45:31.480 --> 45:34.040
In this ensemble of states, this is the goal space.

45:34.040 --> 45:38.920
The goal states in that space, this is what are considered standard human anatomies are.

45:39.560 --> 45:41.480
And there are various other ways to get there.

45:41.480 --> 45:44.840
And there are local maxima that can be avoided and so on.

45:44.840 --> 45:49.320
So being able to navigate to the same region from different starting conditions

45:49.320 --> 45:53.880
is a kind of intelligence that we view as navigation.

45:53.880 --> 45:57.160
Here is an example in an adult organism.

45:57.800 --> 45:59.400
This is an axolotl.

45:59.400 --> 46:00.840
So this is a salamander.

46:00.840 --> 46:06.360
This guy regenerates his limbs, his eyes, jaws, portions of the heart and brain,

46:06.360 --> 46:09.720
spinal cord, ovaries, amazingly regenerative.

46:09.720 --> 46:14.600
What happens is that when a limb is amputated and they bite each other's legs off all the time

46:14.600 --> 46:15.800
when they're when they're housed together.

46:15.800 --> 46:20.440
So this is a natural experiment that happens, whether it's here or here or up here,

46:20.440 --> 46:23.480
the cells will very rapidly build what's needed.

46:23.480 --> 46:26.920
And they make a standard salamander leg and then they stop.

46:26.920 --> 46:31.320
That's the most amazing part of regeneration that first of all,

46:31.320 --> 46:34.680
that it happens exactly the same way no matter what, where you start from.

46:34.680 --> 46:36.280
And second, that it knows when to stop.

46:36.840 --> 46:37.640
When does it stop?

46:37.640 --> 46:40.440
It stops when the correct salamander arm has been completed.

46:40.440 --> 46:43.320
So you can see that what this is is an error minimization scheme.

46:43.320 --> 46:48.440
This is a system that is going to keep working and changing until a large scale

46:48.440 --> 46:51.880
set point of target morphology that looks like this has been reached.

46:51.880 --> 46:54.600
Now, by the way, this is not just for frogs and worms.

46:56.360 --> 46:57.480
There are some examples.

46:57.480 --> 47:00.760
So for example, the human liver is highly regenerative.

47:00.760 --> 47:02.040
Even the ancient Greeks knew that.

47:02.040 --> 47:04.120
I have no idea how they knew that, but they did.

47:05.400 --> 47:07.400
Human children can regenerate their fingertips.

47:07.400 --> 47:10.920
So below a certain age, they will have a cosmetically very, very nice

47:10.920 --> 47:13.240
regeneration of a fingertip amputation.

47:13.240 --> 47:18.200
And deer are a large adult mammal that regenerates a centimeter and a half

47:18.200 --> 47:20.360
of new bone per day when they're growing this.

47:20.360 --> 47:24.680
So bone, vasculature, innervation, skin, all of it.

47:24.680 --> 47:28.280
So this ability, and in fact, in the correct pattern.

47:28.280 --> 47:32.760
So this ability to regenerate is sprinkled throughout the tree of life.

47:32.760 --> 47:34.120
It is really fundamental.

47:34.200 --> 47:39.480
I want to show you one of my maybe all-time examples of creative problem

47:39.480 --> 47:41.880
solving in this kind of space.

47:42.520 --> 47:47.160
So in that salamander that I showed you, in the nude, if you take a section

47:47.160 --> 47:51.160
through a little tubule that goes to the kidney, you see that it's like

47:51.160 --> 47:56.520
eight or 10 cells typically that work together to make this lumen.

47:56.520 --> 48:00.600
One trick you can do is you can make the cells large.

48:00.600 --> 48:02.680
You can force the cells to be larger.

48:02.680 --> 48:07.720
And if you do that, what happens is it adjusts fewer, fewer of those cells

48:07.720 --> 48:11.160
are there to make the same, roughly the same size of lumen.

48:11.160 --> 48:15.160
That's already amazing that it adjusts the number of cells to the size of each cell.

48:17.320 --> 48:23.000
And that, you know, to being a new born into this world, the embryo cannot

48:23.000 --> 48:25.640
count on having the right size of cells.

48:25.640 --> 48:27.720
It has to adapt on the fly.

48:27.720 --> 48:30.200
This is one of many things you can't count on as an embryo.

48:30.200 --> 48:33.240
You have to solve these problems from scratch every time.

48:33.240 --> 48:35.400
So what it'll do is it'll use the right number of cells.

48:35.400 --> 48:41.000
But if you make the cells truly gigantic, one single cell will bend around itself

48:41.000 --> 48:43.640
and leave a space in the middle to give you that tubule.

48:43.640 --> 48:46.680
What's amazing about this is that this is a completely different molecular

48:46.680 --> 48:47.800
mechanism than this.

48:47.800 --> 48:51.480
In other words, this is some sort of cell-to-cell communication tubulogenesis

48:51.480 --> 48:52.120
kind of a thing.

48:52.120 --> 48:53.720
This is cytoskeletal bending.

48:53.720 --> 48:55.720
This is a single cell bending around itself.

48:55.720 --> 48:56.840
So look what's going on here.

48:56.840 --> 49:01.320
Different molecular mechanisms are being called up in the service

49:01.320 --> 49:03.240
of a high-level anatomical goal.

49:03.240 --> 49:05.880
This is what's known as top-down causation.

49:05.880 --> 49:10.200
In the service of a particular anatomical goal, different molecular mechanisms

49:10.200 --> 49:13.720
can be called up.

49:13.720 --> 49:18.760
So this ability to adjust to circumstance has to do with external circumstances,

49:18.760 --> 49:21.400
like being injured or being cut in half or losing a limb,

49:21.400 --> 49:23.240
but also internal circumstances.

49:23.240 --> 49:26.200
Not only can't you count on your body maintaining a particular shape,

49:26.200 --> 49:27.720
you can't even count on your own parts.

49:27.720 --> 49:30.680
You have no idea what size your cells are going to be when you come into the world

49:30.680 --> 49:32.680
and you still have to be able to solve this problem.

49:32.680 --> 49:34.600
So this is amazing.

49:34.600 --> 49:37.560
And again, not through eons of evolutionary change.

49:37.560 --> 49:40.600
This happens immediately in one generation.

49:41.240 --> 49:46.120
So the final example I want to show you is something that we discovered a few years ago.

49:47.400 --> 49:49.320
Here's a normal tappel here.

49:49.320 --> 49:52.920
The eyes, the brain, the nostrils, and the mouth is here.

49:52.920 --> 49:55.640
So these tappels have to become a fraud

49:55.640 --> 49:56.920
in order to become a fraud.

49:56.920 --> 49:58.200
They have to rearrange their face.

49:58.200 --> 49:59.400
So the jaws have to move forward.

49:59.400 --> 50:01.480
The eyes have to come in various things like that.

50:02.040 --> 50:04.920
And it was thought that this is a hard-wired process.

50:04.920 --> 50:09.560
Basically, every organ in the face moves in a certain direction, a certain amount.

50:09.560 --> 50:13.160
And that way, if you just know which direction

50:13.160 --> 50:16.120
and how much you'll go from a standard tappel to a standard fraud.

50:16.120 --> 50:20.040
We made the hypothesis that this was actually a more intelligent process than that.

50:20.040 --> 50:22.200
And so how do you test it with perturbation?

50:22.200 --> 50:25.080
So what we did was we created what we call Picasso tappels.

50:25.080 --> 50:27.720
So the eye is off to the side.

50:27.720 --> 50:28.920
The jaws are on top of the head.

50:28.920 --> 50:31.560
Everything is kind of scrambled.

50:31.560 --> 50:36.040
And what we found is that even those animals generally make pretty normal frogs.

50:36.040 --> 50:40.360
Because all of these organs move in novel unnatural paths

50:40.360 --> 50:42.520
to get to where they're going and then they stop.

50:42.520 --> 50:43.880
Actually, they sometimes overshoot.

50:43.880 --> 50:45.800
They sometimes go too far and then have to come back.

50:45.800 --> 50:50.680
But all of these things move around until they get to a pretty normal frog face.

50:50.680 --> 50:57.000
So what this is, is this idea that genetics isn't specifying some kind of hardware rearrangement,

50:57.000 --> 50:58.440
hard-wired rearrangements.

50:58.440 --> 51:01.480
What it actually specifies is a problem-solving machine,

51:01.480 --> 51:03.560
and we'll get to more of this in the third part of the talk,

51:04.360 --> 51:08.280
that can recognize unexpected states and take corrective action.

51:08.280 --> 51:10.040
It's an error minimization scheme.

51:10.760 --> 51:12.280
So how might that work?

51:12.280 --> 51:15.240
And here's what we have.

51:15.240 --> 51:18.440
The standard story of developmental biology looks like this.

51:18.440 --> 51:21.720
There are genes that interact with each other as gene-regulatory networks.

51:21.720 --> 51:23.800
They make proteins, which do things.

51:23.800 --> 51:24.680
Some of them are sticky.

51:24.680 --> 51:25.560
Some of them diffuse.

51:25.560 --> 51:27.000
Some of them exert force and so on.

51:27.560 --> 51:29.880
And then there's this process of emergence.

51:29.880 --> 51:31.880
So simple rules lead to complex outcomes,

51:31.880 --> 51:34.360
and you get this kind of beautiful anatomy.

51:34.360 --> 51:35.320
And this is all true.

51:35.320 --> 51:36.360
This all happens.

51:36.360 --> 51:42.200
But this leaves out a really critical component, which this is all feed-forward emergence.

51:42.200 --> 51:47.640
But there are all these feedback loops that if you step away from this target morphology,

51:47.720 --> 51:53.480
either by injury or by teratogens or by mutations or anything else,

51:54.360 --> 51:57.560
all kinds of processes at the level of physics and genetics get activated

51:57.560 --> 51:58.920
to try and get you back there.

51:58.920 --> 52:00.680
There's that error minimization scheme,

52:00.680 --> 52:05.800
which is really a kind of anatomical homeostasis or pattern homeostasis.

52:06.360 --> 52:08.680
And a couple of interesting things about this.

52:09.880 --> 52:13.880
On the one hand, this is, but biologists know all about feedback loops.

52:13.880 --> 52:14.600
It's pretty obvious.

52:15.080 --> 52:19.720
But on the other hand, most of the feedback loops we know about are scalar.

52:22.360 --> 52:25.080
All of these homeostatic loops require a set point.

52:25.080 --> 52:29.320
They need to know like a thermostat needs to know what is the thing with respect

52:29.320 --> 52:30.600
to which we calculate error.

52:31.480 --> 52:36.440
Most of these examples of homeostasis in biology are scalar numbers.

52:36.440 --> 52:39.240
They're pH or temperature level or hunger level or something.

52:39.240 --> 52:40.840
I got there a simple quantity.

52:40.920 --> 52:45.320
In this case, we're talking about the set point of this process being a complex

52:45.320 --> 52:46.760
anatomical descriptor.

52:46.760 --> 52:48.760
It doesn't have to be an exact cell by cell kind of thing,

52:48.760 --> 52:51.800
but some general notion of what the correct shape should be

52:51.800 --> 52:53.640
or the correct length of limbs and stuff like that.

52:55.000 --> 52:55.800
So that's unusual.

52:55.800 --> 52:59.960
And of course, the whole notion of a process that's in some sense goal directed

52:59.960 --> 53:01.160
is a kind of taboo.

53:01.160 --> 53:06.840
There's a real what I call teleophobia out there about people are really suspicious

53:06.840 --> 53:09.080
about models of processes with goals.

53:09.080 --> 53:14.760
But I think that cybernetics since the 40s has given us a mature non-magical science

53:14.760 --> 53:15.800
of systems with goals.

53:15.800 --> 53:16.840
So I think it's okay.

53:17.640 --> 53:23.480
But something interesting about this is that if you only know about the first part of this,

53:23.480 --> 53:27.640
then when you want to make changes up here, let's say for biomedical purposes,

53:28.840 --> 53:32.440
your only game plan is to alter the genome.

53:32.440 --> 53:34.600
And that means you have to solve this inverse problem.

53:34.600 --> 53:39.880
You have to ask if I wanted a different shape up here, which genes would I have to change?

53:39.880 --> 53:43.560
And as we talked about a few minutes ago, that is in general an unsolvable problem

53:43.560 --> 53:47.560
because this process is so complex and so convoluted.

53:47.560 --> 53:48.760
You can't just reverse it.

53:48.760 --> 53:51.000
You don't know which genes to change.

53:51.560 --> 53:56.200
But if there is kind of this homeostasis relative to a set point,

53:56.200 --> 53:57.480
then you've got a different strategy.

53:57.480 --> 54:03.880
Maybe this isn't at the mechanical clock part of that continuum that I showed you.

54:03.880 --> 54:08.760
Maybe this is closer to that thermostat level where you can actually change the set point.

54:08.760 --> 54:14.600
You can revise the set point without having to change the hardware without changing the

54:14.600 --> 54:15.080
genes at all.

54:15.080 --> 54:16.680
And this is what I'm going to show you now.

54:16.680 --> 54:21.320
So what we wanted was, and this is years of work on this now,

54:22.280 --> 54:26.840
what we wanted was to, if this is all true, we should be able to do a couple of things.

54:26.840 --> 54:30.760
First of all, we should be able to identify where that set point is stored.

54:30.760 --> 54:33.000
And I'm going to show you that, decode it.

54:33.000 --> 54:36.040
And I'm going to show you a couple of examples of how we can actually read it

54:36.040 --> 54:37.560
and understand what it says.

54:37.560 --> 54:41.560
And we should be able to rewrite it and let the cells build to the new pattern

54:41.560 --> 54:43.160
without changing out the hardware.

54:43.160 --> 54:44.280
Let me show you that.

54:44.280 --> 54:45.640
So how might this work?

54:45.640 --> 54:48.120
At the very beginning of this, I started thinking about, okay,

54:48.120 --> 54:52.120
how can we even talk about cells and tissues storing a goal state,

54:52.120 --> 54:55.720
storing some kind of a target for all this activity?

54:56.440 --> 55:01.240
And of course, the one really good uncontroversial example of a biological system

55:01.240 --> 55:04.360
that stores goal states and acts towards them is the brain.

55:04.360 --> 55:07.160
This is what complex creatures do all the time.

55:07.160 --> 55:11.320
So the brain stores memories of target states,

55:11.320 --> 55:15.080
and it acts in three-dimensional space to achieve those goals.

55:15.080 --> 55:16.280
How does it do it?

55:16.280 --> 55:19.000
Well, the hardware looks like this.

55:19.000 --> 55:22.040
This is an electrical network where you've got cells.

55:22.680 --> 55:25.240
The cells have little ion channels in their membrane,

55:25.240 --> 55:28.200
which allows them to pass things like potassium, sodium, and so on.

55:28.200 --> 55:30.920
They acquire, by doing that, they acquire a voltage gradient,

55:30.920 --> 55:33.400
a difference, voltage difference between inside and out.

55:33.400 --> 55:36.760
And that voltage gradient may or may not be communicated to the neighboring cells

55:36.760 --> 55:39.960
through these little electric synapses known as gap junctions.

55:39.960 --> 55:44.520
So you have a network of cells that can store different states electrically,

55:44.520 --> 55:46.200
and they can propagate information,

55:46.200 --> 55:48.440
and that information spreads to the network.

55:48.440 --> 55:50.920
And that is what runs the software of the brain.

55:50.920 --> 55:55.000
And so what you can see here is this group made this amazing video

55:55.000 --> 56:00.120
of real-time electrical signaling in the zebrafish, a living zebrafish brain.

56:00.120 --> 56:06.600
So you can see here's what's going on as the fish is thinking about

56:06.600 --> 56:08.040
whatever fish think about.

56:08.040 --> 56:10.840
And it is a commitment of neuroscience

56:10.840 --> 56:14.760
that if we were able to read out these electrical signals,

56:15.320 --> 56:18.600
we could decode them and thus know what the fish is thinking.

56:18.600 --> 56:23.160
We should be able to recover the memories, the goals, the various preferences,

56:23.160 --> 56:26.600
the behavioral repertoires, and so on by decoding this.

56:26.600 --> 56:32.600
So to summarize, and this is the project of neural decoding here in neuroscience,

56:32.600 --> 56:36.440
where you try to image the brain and you make a model

56:36.440 --> 56:39.720
and you understand what that animal is thinking or seeing and so on.

56:39.720 --> 56:45.880
And so the idea is that according to neuroscience,

56:45.880 --> 56:49.080
the bioelectrical signaling in the brain is literally the medium

56:49.080 --> 56:51.800
that contains the cognitive content of the mind.

56:51.800 --> 56:54.520
So you as a person, all your memories and thoughts and everything else

56:54.520 --> 56:58.040
is in some way encoded in the electrophysiology of your brain.

56:58.040 --> 57:00.760
Well, the amazing thing is that this ancient...

57:00.760 --> 57:02.520
So that's a really neat trick, right?

57:02.520 --> 57:05.000
That combination of hardware and software is amazing.

57:05.800 --> 57:09.880
But what's really interesting is that architecture,

57:09.880 --> 57:12.200
the architecture of having this electrical hardware

57:12.200 --> 57:18.680
and thus this very plastic goal seeking clever and problem-solving software

57:18.680 --> 57:20.360
is absolutely ancient.

57:20.360 --> 57:23.160
So every cell in your body has ion channels.

57:23.160 --> 57:27.240
Most of them have gab junctions to neighboring cells.

57:27.240 --> 57:32.520
This is not something that's just for neural cells

57:32.520 --> 57:35.880
and it's something that's been around since the time of bacterial biofilms.

57:35.880 --> 57:39.240
This is evolution figured out this architecture very early on.

57:39.240 --> 57:44.520
And so then one can try to extend this and basically this is the project

57:44.520 --> 57:47.560
and this is what we've been doing for almost 30 years now

57:47.560 --> 57:51.720
is this idea of extending neuroscience beyond neurons.

57:51.720 --> 57:56.680
The real kind of magic of neuroscience is not in the neurons.

57:56.680 --> 58:00.440
It's in this understanding, this scaling up of cognition.

58:00.440 --> 58:05.560
And so what you might imagine is doing exactly the same kind of neural decoding thing,

58:05.560 --> 58:06.520
but not on neurons.

58:06.520 --> 58:09.560
Let's say on embryos or some other morphogenetic system to ask,

58:10.280 --> 58:13.400
here you're asking what is the collective intelligence of neurons thinking.

58:13.960 --> 58:16.600
Here you're asking for what is the collective intelligence

58:16.600 --> 58:20.760
of the rest of the body cells thinking quite literally.

58:21.560 --> 58:24.760
And I can use the thing is, this sounds very strange

58:24.760 --> 58:28.680
and a lot of people will say that this is some kind of a weird misuse of a metaphor.

58:28.680 --> 58:32.440
But the reason that I can apply all this terminology from neuroscience

58:32.520 --> 58:38.600
to outside the brain is because the concepts, the tools, the reagents

58:38.600 --> 58:42.600
cannot tell the difference between neurons and non-neural tissues.

58:42.600 --> 58:45.480
All of the same tools and concepts work everywhere in the body.

58:45.480 --> 58:46.760
This is what we've been showing.

58:46.760 --> 58:50.360
And so the concepts are actually very isomorphic.

58:50.360 --> 58:56.040
And so what you have here is that whereas the electrical network,

58:56.040 --> 58:57.880
just to kind of summarize what I'm saying here,

58:58.440 --> 59:03.320
the electrical network of the brain is giving commands to the muscles

59:03.320 --> 59:05.800
to move you through three dimensional space.

59:05.800 --> 59:08.520
That's the familiar version of neuroscience.

59:08.520 --> 59:10.840
And then we can modify it with various techniques

59:10.840 --> 59:12.520
and we can read it out and so on.

59:12.520 --> 59:15.720
So the electrical network of the brain tells muscles what to do

59:15.720 --> 59:17.800
to move you in three dimensional space.

59:17.800 --> 59:19.880
But the reason it can do that is because it evolved

59:19.880 --> 59:23.560
from a much more ancient system in other tissues in your body

59:23.640 --> 59:26.440
that long before brains and muscles evolved,

59:26.440 --> 59:32.120
we're telling all the cells how to rearrange your body shape

59:32.120 --> 59:35.400
and thus move you in anatomical morphospace.

59:35.400 --> 59:39.640
Same strategy, same hardware, same tricks, except it's a different space.

59:39.640 --> 59:42.360
And so this is what I said before when I said that evolution

59:42.360 --> 59:45.000
was pivoting us through various problem spaces.

59:45.000 --> 59:49.480
So what we did was to develop the first molecular tools

59:49.480 --> 59:53.160
to read and write this information outside of the nervous system.

59:53.160 --> 59:54.440
So how do we do that?

59:54.440 --> 59:59.160
So the first thing is a voltage sensitive fluorescent dye.

59:59.160 --> 01:00:03.320
So this is a chemical that emits either different brightness

01:00:03.320 --> 01:00:07.080
or different wavelengths, light depending on the electrical properties

01:00:07.080 --> 01:00:08.440
of the cell that it's sitting in.

01:00:08.440 --> 01:00:13.400
And so what you're seeing here is a time lapse of a frog embryo

01:00:13.400 --> 01:00:15.160
as during the early stages.

01:00:15.160 --> 01:00:19.000
And so the colors represent different voltages.

01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:23.720
And so this is a kind of brain scan, if you will,

01:00:24.440 --> 01:00:27.400
of all the conversations that the cells are having with each other

01:00:27.400 --> 01:00:30.120
as they sort out who's going to be left, who's going to be right,

01:00:30.120 --> 01:00:33.240
who's going to be anterior, posterior, dorsal, ventral, and so on.

01:00:33.240 --> 01:00:39.800
And so we now have the ability to read out this kind of information.

01:00:39.800 --> 01:00:42.440
We spend a lot of time doing computer simulations

01:00:42.440 --> 01:00:46.440
to figure out how these patterns map onto the patterns of ion channels

01:00:46.440 --> 01:00:48.200
that are present in the cell membranes.

01:00:48.200 --> 01:00:49.720
I want to show you two kinds of patterns.

01:00:50.440 --> 01:00:52.360
The first we call the electric face.

01:00:52.360 --> 01:00:53.800
And this is, again, a time lapse.

01:00:53.800 --> 01:00:56.760
Now here, it's gray scale instead of color, but it's the same idea.

01:00:56.760 --> 01:00:59.160
The brightness represents voltage.

01:00:59.160 --> 01:01:02.440
And so in this early frog embryo that's putting its face together,

01:01:02.440 --> 01:01:04.920
there's all kinds of changes, lots of exciting stuff happening.

01:01:04.920 --> 01:01:06.920
But look at this one frame taken from it.

01:01:08.120 --> 01:01:11.960
Long before the genes are turned on to make the different parts of the face,

01:01:11.960 --> 01:01:14.360
we can already see what this animal is going to do.

01:01:14.360 --> 01:01:16.200
Here's where the animal's right eye is going to be.

01:01:16.200 --> 01:01:17.720
Here's where the mouth is going to be.

01:01:17.720 --> 01:01:19.720
The left eye comes in slightly thereafter.

01:01:19.720 --> 01:01:21.160
You will see that momentarily.

01:01:22.680 --> 01:01:25.160
Here are the placodes on the sides.

01:01:25.160 --> 01:01:29.080
The B pattern of where everything is going to go

01:01:29.080 --> 01:01:34.840
is already there in the stable electrical states of the cells

01:01:34.840 --> 01:01:36.440
if you know how to read them out.

01:01:36.440 --> 01:01:37.880
So this is the electric face.

01:01:37.880 --> 01:01:42.520
And I'm going to show you in a minute that if you make changes here,

01:01:42.520 --> 01:01:43.880
you will change gene expression.

01:01:43.880 --> 01:01:44.920
You will change anatomy.

01:01:44.920 --> 01:01:47.240
Therefore, this pattern is instructive.

01:01:47.320 --> 01:01:47.960
It drives.

01:01:47.960 --> 01:01:49.960
This is not just some sort of epiphenomenon.

01:01:49.960 --> 01:01:55.080
This is actually the memory of what the cells are going to be doing

01:01:55.800 --> 01:01:56.600
to make the face.

01:01:56.600 --> 01:01:58.040
So that's a natural pattern.

01:01:58.040 --> 01:02:01.480
But here's a pathological pattern.

01:02:01.480 --> 01:02:04.040
And we'll talk more about cancer in the third part of the talk.

01:02:04.040 --> 01:02:08.440
If I inject a human oncogene, there will be a tumor.

01:02:10.040 --> 01:02:11.720
But before that tumor forms,

01:02:11.720 --> 01:02:19.080
I can already see where the cells are starting to defect.

01:02:19.080 --> 01:02:21.240
They acquire this abnormal bioelectric state.

01:02:21.880 --> 01:02:23.640
And I can already see where the tumor is going to be.

01:02:23.640 --> 01:02:25.240
So this is a pathological pattern.

01:02:25.240 --> 01:02:27.560
So in addition to being able to observe all this stuff,

01:02:27.560 --> 01:02:30.120
which is nice, but it's just observation,

01:02:31.320 --> 01:02:34.600
what we developed were a set of tools patterned on exactly the same thing

01:02:34.600 --> 01:02:38.200
done in neuroscience to study synaptic plasticity and intrinsic plasticity.

01:02:38.760 --> 01:02:43.400
And basically be able to, so I showed you how to read the patterns.

01:02:43.400 --> 01:02:44.920
I'm showing you how to write the patterns.

01:02:44.920 --> 01:02:48.840
So you can rewrite those patterns by manipulating the gap junctions,

01:02:48.840 --> 01:02:50.200
these electrical synapses.

01:02:50.200 --> 01:02:53.000
So that controls the connectivity of this network.

01:02:53.000 --> 01:02:55.880
Or you can actually open channels, open them,

01:02:56.920 --> 01:02:59.240
using drugs or close them using drugs, using light,

01:02:59.240 --> 01:03:03.320
the various kinds of stimuli to control the voltage of every cell.

01:03:03.320 --> 01:03:06.200
So to be clear, there are no applied fields.

01:03:06.200 --> 01:03:07.400
There are no electrodes.

01:03:07.400 --> 01:03:09.480
There's no electromagnetic radiation.

01:03:09.480 --> 01:03:11.160
There are no magnets, nothing like that.

01:03:11.160 --> 01:03:16.520
This is molecular physiology using the natural interface

01:03:16.520 --> 01:03:18.280
that these cells are exposing to us.

01:03:18.280 --> 01:03:21.560
These, this is the same interface that they use to hack each other.

01:03:21.560 --> 01:03:23.720
These are, this is the way the cells are communicating,

01:03:23.720 --> 01:03:25.000
and we're just hijacking it.

01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:27.400
So there are no external fields, nothing like that.

01:03:28.680 --> 01:03:32.680
Okay, so using this technology then, we know what happens

01:03:32.680 --> 01:03:33.640
when you use it in the brain.

01:03:33.640 --> 01:03:35.960
So somebody like Tanagawa at MIT can use this

01:03:35.960 --> 01:03:39.240
to put false memories into the brains of mice,

01:03:39.240 --> 01:03:41.560
using exactly this technology in the brain.

01:03:41.560 --> 01:03:43.720
We are going to put false memories

01:03:43.720 --> 01:03:47.240
into the somatic networks of cells that are building the body.

01:03:47.240 --> 01:03:49.000
So when you do that, here's what happens.

01:03:49.640 --> 01:03:54.280
You can convince cells to make ectopic hearts like this.

01:03:54.280 --> 01:03:56.120
Here are some extra hearts in the tadpole.

01:03:56.120 --> 01:03:57.400
You can make extra limbs.

01:03:57.400 --> 01:04:00.200
So you can ask the cells in the jaw to start generating a limb.

01:04:00.200 --> 01:04:03.480
And here are some six-legged frogs here.

01:04:03.480 --> 01:04:05.240
You can make ectopic forebrain.

01:04:05.240 --> 01:04:08.200
You can make ectopic inner ear organs right here.

01:04:08.200 --> 01:04:09.480
Or you can even make fins.

01:04:09.480 --> 01:04:10.680
Now that's especially weird

01:04:10.680 --> 01:04:12.360
because tadpoles aren't supposed to have fins.

01:04:12.360 --> 01:04:14.920
And I'll show you some of that momentarily.

01:04:14.920 --> 01:04:16.760
But here's one of my favorite examples.

01:04:17.640 --> 01:04:19.480
I showed you, if you remember that electric face,

01:04:19.480 --> 01:04:20.920
one of the things about that electric face

01:04:20.920 --> 01:04:24.200
was that there was a pattern that said where the eye should go.

01:04:24.200 --> 01:04:27.000
It represented the location where the cells should become an eye.

01:04:27.080 --> 01:04:30.200
And so we simply said, okay, if we try to reproduce

01:04:30.200 --> 01:04:31.960
that electrical state elsewhere in the body,

01:04:31.960 --> 01:04:35.480
can we induce some other kinds of cells to be an eye?

01:04:37.240 --> 01:04:37.800
And so we did.

01:04:37.800 --> 01:04:40.360
So we injected some mRNA encoding,

01:04:40.360 --> 01:04:44.920
some potassium channels into a different type of cells

01:04:44.920 --> 01:04:47.400
that were not going to be that region.

01:04:47.400 --> 01:04:48.840
In particular, they were this gut.

01:04:48.840 --> 01:04:50.200
They were fated to be gut.

01:04:50.200 --> 01:04:53.560
And if you do that, if you create that pattern in those cells,

01:04:53.560 --> 01:04:55.960
sure enough, they will make, they will build an eye.

01:04:55.960 --> 01:04:58.920
And these eyes will have all the right cell layers.

01:04:58.920 --> 01:05:02.920
So retinal lens, optic nerve, they'll have all that stuff.

01:05:02.920 --> 01:05:04.600
Notice, notice a couple of interesting things.

01:05:04.600 --> 01:05:08.520
Number one, this bioelectric pattern is instructive.

01:05:08.520 --> 01:05:09.720
It tells cells what to do.

01:05:09.720 --> 01:05:11.480
It doesn't just ruin the old pattern,

01:05:11.480 --> 01:05:13.720
it actually can call up whole organs.

01:05:13.720 --> 01:05:17.800
Number two, it expands the notion of competency.

01:05:17.800 --> 01:05:19.720
In the developmental biology textbook,

01:05:19.720 --> 01:05:22.920
what you will read is that only these cells up here

01:05:22.920 --> 01:05:24.360
in the anterior and directed room

01:05:24.360 --> 01:05:26.280
are actually competent to become eye.

01:05:26.280 --> 01:05:29.080
And that's true if you use the traditional way of inducing eyes,

01:05:29.080 --> 01:05:31.240
which is this master eye gene called PAC-6.

01:05:31.240 --> 01:05:33.480
But it's not true if you go up a level

01:05:33.480 --> 01:05:36.440
and use the bioelectric signals, you can make eyes anywhere.

01:05:36.440 --> 01:05:38.280
So it completely changes our idea.

01:05:39.000 --> 01:05:41.160
Learning to hack these cells in a different way

01:05:41.160 --> 01:05:44.600
changes this, our understanding of their competency.

01:05:45.960 --> 01:05:48.440
And notice the third thing that's amazing

01:05:48.440 --> 01:05:51.560
is that we didn't provide very much information at all.

01:05:51.560 --> 01:05:52.760
I mean, eyes are very complex.

01:05:52.840 --> 01:05:55.080
We didn't tell this animal how to make an eye.

01:05:55.080 --> 01:05:59.720
We basically just triggered the eye morphogenetic subroutine

01:05:59.720 --> 01:06:02.280
with a simple trigger that says build an eye here.

01:06:02.280 --> 01:06:02.680
That's it.

01:06:02.680 --> 01:06:04.200
We didn't say where the stem cells go

01:06:04.200 --> 01:06:06.120
or how to make a retina, none of that.

01:06:06.120 --> 01:06:07.240
It's very modular.

01:06:07.240 --> 01:06:08.840
It's very hierarchical.

01:06:09.960 --> 01:06:13.960
And so the next kind of part of this

01:06:13.960 --> 01:06:15.480
that's my favorite is this.

01:06:15.480 --> 01:06:18.440
Here's a lens, an ectopic lens sitting out

01:06:18.440 --> 01:06:20.040
in the tail of a tadpole somewhere.

01:06:20.040 --> 01:06:21.800
So we've induced the lens.

01:06:21.800 --> 01:06:23.320
The way we've induced it is just like here.

01:06:23.320 --> 01:06:25.080
We injected some ion channels.

01:06:25.080 --> 01:06:28.760
These ion channels are labeled with this blue beta-gal signal.

01:06:29.720 --> 01:06:32.200
So what you can see here is that the blue cells are the ones

01:06:32.200 --> 01:06:34.120
to which we said build an eye.

01:06:35.160 --> 01:06:37.800
But there's not enough of them to build a proper lens.

01:06:37.800 --> 01:06:38.600
And so what did they do?

01:06:38.600 --> 01:06:41.080
They recruited a bunch of their nearby buddies,

01:06:41.080 --> 01:06:43.560
all of this stuff here that we never touched.

01:06:44.360 --> 01:06:45.880
So it's a secondary instruction.

01:06:45.880 --> 01:06:48.040
We instruct these cells to make an eye.

01:06:48.040 --> 01:06:50.040
They instruct their neighbors to work with them

01:06:50.040 --> 01:06:51.240
to complete the task.

01:06:51.240 --> 01:06:53.560
This is something you see in other collective intelligence

01:06:53.560 --> 01:06:56.760
is like ants, where when a few ants come across a project

01:06:56.760 --> 01:06:58.520
that's too big for them to handle, what do they do?

01:06:58.520 --> 01:06:59.960
They recruit others.

01:06:59.960 --> 01:07:03.400
And so this ability of the system to self-scale

01:07:03.400 --> 01:07:05.400
to the available problem is something

01:07:05.400 --> 01:07:07.080
that you see in other collective intelligences.

01:07:07.080 --> 01:07:10.760
So we don't have to tell these cells how big an eye should be

01:07:10.760 --> 01:07:12.360
or how many cells there should be.

01:07:12.360 --> 01:07:14.120
All of this is part of the competency

01:07:14.120 --> 01:07:17.480
of this amazing agential medium in which we're working.

01:07:17.480 --> 01:07:19.160
And we'll get to that notion.

01:07:19.160 --> 01:07:21.720
But the fact that these cells are solving problems collectively,

01:07:21.720 --> 01:07:24.040
they know how big this group is.

01:07:24.040 --> 01:07:25.480
They know how big it's supposed to be.

01:07:25.480 --> 01:07:28.040
The collective functionally knows all these things

01:07:28.040 --> 01:07:30.760
because you can see it.

01:07:30.760 --> 01:07:35.720
So we use the same kind of strategy

01:07:35.720 --> 01:07:38.280
to address the issue of leg regeneration.

01:07:38.280 --> 01:07:40.760
So frogs normally do not regenerate their legs,

01:07:40.760 --> 01:07:41.960
unlike salamanders.

01:07:41.960 --> 01:07:43.880
But what we can do is after amputation,

01:07:43.880 --> 01:07:46.840
we can treat with a cocktail of ion channel drugs.

01:07:46.840 --> 01:07:49.240
And in fact, they turn on immediately

01:07:49.240 --> 01:07:51.000
these pro regenerative genes.

01:07:51.000 --> 01:07:52.040
They begin to make a leg.

01:07:52.040 --> 01:07:52.920
You've got some toes.

01:07:52.920 --> 01:07:55.640
By 45 days, you've already got a toenail and some toes.

01:07:55.640 --> 01:07:57.560
Eventually, a very nice leg.

01:07:57.560 --> 01:07:59.960
The leg is touch sensitive and motile.

01:07:59.960 --> 01:08:03.880
And all of this happens from a brief modulation.

01:08:03.880 --> 01:08:06.120
In fact, in the recent work on adult frogs,

01:08:06.120 --> 01:08:09.240
we show that just one day, 24 hours of application

01:08:09.240 --> 01:08:13.560
of our cocktail, you get a year and a half of leg growth.

01:08:13.560 --> 01:08:14.920
So this is not 3D printing.

01:08:14.920 --> 01:08:15.960
This is not scaffolds.

01:08:15.960 --> 01:08:17.880
This is not us telling stem cells where to go

01:08:17.880 --> 01:08:19.640
or what tissues go next to what tissues.

01:08:19.640 --> 01:08:21.560
We have no idea how to build a frog leg.

01:08:21.560 --> 01:08:24.040
It'll be a really long time before anybody

01:08:24.040 --> 01:08:26.520
can micromanage that process, but you don't need to.

01:08:26.520 --> 01:08:28.360
Because the cells already know how to do it.

01:08:28.360 --> 01:08:29.880
What you do need to do is to convince them

01:08:29.880 --> 01:08:31.880
that that's what they should do instead of scarring.

01:08:31.880 --> 01:08:33.720
And that doesn't take very long.

01:08:33.720 --> 01:08:35.320
24 hours is plenty.

01:08:35.320 --> 01:08:36.760
And once they've decided that that's

01:08:36.760 --> 01:08:38.680
where they're going in morphogenetic space,

01:08:38.680 --> 01:08:39.880
they will keep going.

01:08:39.880 --> 01:08:41.960
And this is how regenerative medicine

01:08:41.960 --> 01:08:44.840
can take advantage of the competencies of these cells.

01:08:44.920 --> 01:08:46.520
And here I should do a disclosure,

01:08:46.520 --> 01:08:49.160
because David Kaplan and I are co-founders of a company

01:08:49.160 --> 01:08:50.840
called Morphosuticals Inc.

01:08:50.840 --> 01:08:53.000
And what we're trying to do is the same thing in rodents.

01:08:53.000 --> 01:08:55.720
So David makes these amazing wearable bioreactors

01:08:55.720 --> 01:08:59.160
that apply to the wound site, our drug payloads,

01:08:59.160 --> 01:09:01.240
which are various things that attempt

01:09:01.240 --> 01:09:03.720
to convince the cells that they should regenerate.

01:09:03.720 --> 01:09:07.720
So hopefully, eventually, we'll be using this

01:09:07.720 --> 01:09:08.840
in clinical practice.

01:09:08.840 --> 01:09:11.400
For now, we've done it in frog.

01:09:11.400 --> 01:09:14.120
We're currently trying to do it in mammals

01:09:14.120 --> 01:09:16.760
and eventually, hopefully, in patients.

01:09:16.760 --> 01:09:17.720
OK.

01:09:17.720 --> 01:09:21.320
For the next story, I want to switch back to planarium.

01:09:21.320 --> 01:09:23.480
So this kind of animal.

01:09:23.480 --> 01:09:26.440
And I want to, at this point, make good on the promise

01:09:26.440 --> 01:09:28.360
that I made about 10 minutes ago, which

01:09:28.360 --> 01:09:32.040
is to show you how those gold states are actually encoded.

01:09:32.040 --> 01:09:35.400
How does the tissue remember what a correct animal

01:09:35.400 --> 01:09:36.280
should look like?

01:09:36.280 --> 01:09:39.400
And the planaria are a great example of this,

01:09:39.400 --> 01:09:41.800
because if you cut them into pieces,

01:09:41.800 --> 01:09:45.960
and the record is something like 276, I believe,

01:09:45.960 --> 01:09:48.520
each of these pieces regrows a perfect little worm.

01:09:48.520 --> 01:09:51.080
They make exactly what's needed, no more, no less.

01:09:51.080 --> 01:09:53.320
And in fact, it's a tough problem, because even

01:09:53.320 --> 01:09:57.080
if you make just one cut here, these cells back here

01:09:57.080 --> 01:09:58.360
have to make a tail.

01:09:58.360 --> 01:10:00.200
These cells up here have to make a head,

01:10:00.200 --> 01:10:01.720
but they were exact neighbors.

01:10:01.720 --> 01:10:03.080
Right up until the time you cut them,

01:10:03.080 --> 01:10:04.120
they were exact neighbors.

01:10:04.120 --> 01:10:07.320
And yet they have radically different anatomical fates.

01:10:07.320 --> 01:10:08.840
So you cannot decide if you're going

01:10:08.840 --> 01:10:11.080
to be a head or a tail based on your position in the animal.

01:10:11.080 --> 01:10:12.040
They have the same position.

01:10:12.040 --> 01:10:13.160
You can cut anywhere.

01:10:13.160 --> 01:10:15.800
It's after the cut, you have to now figure out,

01:10:15.800 --> 01:10:16.520
what am I missing?

01:10:16.520 --> 01:10:17.480
What do I still have?

01:10:17.480 --> 01:10:20.200
And what does a correct planarian look like?

01:10:20.200 --> 01:10:22.600
So oh, and by the way, these animals are also immoral.

01:10:22.600 --> 01:10:24.800
In case you're interested in aging,

01:10:24.800 --> 01:10:27.080
planaria are, they do not age.

01:10:27.080 --> 01:10:28.600
There's no such thing as an old planarian,

01:10:28.600 --> 01:10:32.120
because they continuously regenerate their tissues.

01:10:32.120 --> 01:10:34.520
So we wanted to ask this simple question.

01:10:34.520 --> 01:10:37.000
OK, here's our planarian.

01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:39.200
And we amputate the head, and we amputate the tail.

01:10:39.240 --> 01:10:41.200
So you have this middle fragment.

01:10:41.200 --> 01:10:43.440
The middle fragment reliably regenerates

01:10:43.440 --> 01:10:45.720
to have one head, one tail.

01:10:45.720 --> 01:10:47.960
How does this piece know how many heads and tails

01:10:47.960 --> 01:10:49.040
it's supposed to have?

01:10:49.040 --> 01:10:52.480
So we investigated and found out that there's actually

01:10:52.480 --> 01:10:54.720
an electrical circuit, which I don't have time to go into,

01:10:54.720 --> 01:10:57.360
but there's an electrical circuit, which actually

01:10:57.360 --> 01:10:59.520
encodes the number of heads that they're supposed to have.

01:10:59.520 --> 01:11:03.760
And so what we were able to do then is this.

01:11:03.760 --> 01:11:08.160
Here is a visualization of the normal electrical pattern

01:11:08.160 --> 01:11:11.040
in these fragments, so one head, one tail.

01:11:11.040 --> 01:11:13.720
But what you can do is you can rewrite that pattern

01:11:13.720 --> 01:11:15.200
to say two heads.

01:11:15.200 --> 01:11:16.920
Now, this is kind of messy still.

01:11:16.920 --> 01:11:19.280
So the technology is still very much in development,

01:11:19.280 --> 01:11:21.480
but you can already see, you can do that.

01:11:21.480 --> 01:11:23.680
And when you do that to this animal,

01:11:23.680 --> 01:11:26.120
they go ahead and they make a two-headed flatworm.

01:11:26.120 --> 01:11:27.000
This is not Photoshop.

01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:29.680
These are real two-headed animals.

01:11:29.680 --> 01:11:31.840
Notice something interesting.

01:11:31.840 --> 01:11:35.120
So here's anatomically one head, one tail.

01:11:35.120 --> 01:11:36.920
The gene expression for the head is, of course,

01:11:36.960 --> 01:11:38.800
in the head and so on.

01:11:38.800 --> 01:11:42.200
This animal, this bioelectrical map

01:11:42.200 --> 01:11:43.760
is not a map of this two-headed guy.

01:11:43.760 --> 01:11:47.480
This is a map of this perfectly normal, anatomically normal,

01:11:47.480 --> 01:11:48.680
one-headed animal.

01:11:48.680 --> 01:11:50.640
Not only is his anatomy still normal,

01:11:50.640 --> 01:11:53.480
his molecular biology is still normal.

01:11:53.480 --> 01:11:56.760
The anterior marker is still only on in the head,

01:11:56.760 --> 01:11:58.280
not in the tail.

01:11:58.280 --> 01:12:01.200
So, and yet, if you were to cut them,

01:12:01.200 --> 01:12:03.280
they go on and to make two-headed flatworms.

01:12:03.320 --> 01:12:06.920
So let me pause here and just explain,

01:12:06.920 --> 01:12:08.680
to underline what's going on here.

01:12:09.680 --> 01:12:12.840
This bioelectrical pattern is what I promised before

01:12:12.840 --> 01:12:16.920
as a readout of where the information

01:12:16.920 --> 01:12:18.480
for the target morphology,

01:12:18.480 --> 01:12:21.080
the target, the correct pattern to build,

01:12:21.080 --> 01:12:22.280
this is where it's stored.

01:12:22.280 --> 01:12:25.200
It is literally stored in this electrical map,

01:12:25.200 --> 01:12:27.640
the way that memories are thought to be stored

01:12:27.640 --> 01:12:28.960
in the brain.

01:12:28.960 --> 01:12:32.480
Also, a single normal planarian body

01:12:32.480 --> 01:12:36.120
is able to store one of two different ideas

01:12:36.120 --> 01:12:38.640
about what a correct planarian should look like.

01:12:38.640 --> 01:12:39.520
In other words, this again,

01:12:39.520 --> 01:12:41.000
sounds very much like the nervous system

01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:43.160
where the exact same hardware, your brain,

01:12:43.160 --> 01:12:46.360
can store many, many different types of ideas,

01:12:46.360 --> 01:12:48.160
and you do not have to genetically edit your brain

01:12:48.160 --> 01:12:51.000
to have it store different types of information.

01:12:51.000 --> 01:12:53.600
It's just built to have different targets

01:12:53.600 --> 01:12:55.600
that it can remember.

01:12:55.600 --> 01:12:58.800
And so, and the third amazing thing about this is that

01:12:58.800 --> 01:13:01.920
this pattern memory is a kind of counterfactual,

01:13:01.920 --> 01:13:05.880
meaning that this is a memory of what I am going to do

01:13:05.880 --> 01:13:07.880
if I get injured in the future.

01:13:07.880 --> 01:13:09.080
It's not what I'm doing now.

01:13:09.080 --> 01:13:11.480
It's what I will do if at some point in the future

01:13:11.480 --> 01:13:12.360
I get injured.

01:13:12.360 --> 01:13:16.080
So that ability to, it's a very primitive version

01:13:16.080 --> 01:13:18.040
of what's sort of magical about brains,

01:13:18.040 --> 01:13:20.680
which is this ability to mental time travel,

01:13:20.680 --> 01:13:23.720
to think about, to have memories of things

01:13:23.720 --> 01:13:25.880
that happened long ago and are not true now,

01:13:25.880 --> 01:13:27.360
and to have anticipation of things

01:13:27.360 --> 01:13:28.440
that might happen in the future

01:13:28.440 --> 01:13:29.920
that are also not happening now.

01:13:29.920 --> 01:13:32.080
People think that this is very much

01:13:32.080 --> 01:13:33.880
the kind of thing that brains do and it is,

01:13:33.880 --> 01:13:37.200
but the evolutionary precursors of that are ancient,

01:13:37.200 --> 01:13:40.560
and even the planarian morphological intelligence

01:13:40.560 --> 01:13:44.560
has a degree of ability to do this kind of mental time travel.

01:13:44.560 --> 01:13:46.440
Now, why do I keep calling it a memory?

01:13:46.440 --> 01:13:50.940
Because if you take these two-headed worms,

01:13:52.320 --> 01:13:53.880
and you cut them again in plain water,

01:13:53.880 --> 01:13:56.800
no more manipulation of any kind,

01:13:56.800 --> 01:13:59.400
they continue to form two-headed animals.

01:13:59.440 --> 01:14:01.600
So no genetic change.

01:14:01.600 --> 01:14:02.680
The hardware is untouched.

01:14:02.680 --> 01:14:04.800
These, the genomes here are exactly the same.

01:14:04.800 --> 01:14:06.160
We haven't done any genomic editing,

01:14:06.160 --> 01:14:07.800
nothing wrong with their genomes.

01:14:07.800 --> 01:14:10.560
And yet this is a permanent line of animals

01:14:10.560 --> 01:14:14.640
that will continue to generate two-headed creatures,

01:14:14.640 --> 01:14:17.240
even though they have the normal wild-type genome.

01:14:17.240 --> 01:14:20.440
So the question of where is,

01:14:20.440 --> 01:14:22.200
remember that slide I showed at the beginning,

01:14:22.200 --> 01:14:23.960
that human torso, and I asked,

01:14:23.960 --> 01:14:25.560
where is that information stored?

01:14:26.640 --> 01:14:28.200
Where is the information stored

01:14:28.200 --> 01:14:30.840
for the number of heads a worm should have?

01:14:30.840 --> 01:14:31.760
It isn't genetic,

01:14:31.760 --> 01:14:34.840
because you can take the exact same genetic hardware

01:14:34.840 --> 01:14:36.760
and have it be two-headed.

01:14:36.760 --> 01:14:38.480
But what the genome does do

01:14:38.480 --> 01:14:41.080
is to build an electrical circuit

01:14:41.080 --> 01:14:44.480
that by default stores the information for one head,

01:14:44.480 --> 01:14:46.320
but it can be pushed to other fates,

01:14:46.320 --> 01:14:48.960
for example, to store information for two heads.

01:14:48.960 --> 01:14:50.120
So this is why I call it memory.

01:14:50.120 --> 01:14:51.800
It's long-term stable.

01:14:51.800 --> 01:14:53.720
It's rewritable, and we can also, by the way,

01:14:53.720 --> 01:14:56.480
take two-headed and put them back to one-headed.

01:14:56.480 --> 01:14:57.640
And it has this latency,

01:14:57.640 --> 01:14:59.360
which I just showed you, this conditional recall.

01:14:59.360 --> 01:15:02.600
It doesn't kick in until you've injured the animal.

01:15:02.600 --> 01:15:03.440
And so here you can see,

01:15:03.440 --> 01:15:06.920
this is a video of these two-headed critters

01:15:06.920 --> 01:15:08.600
doing their thing.

01:15:08.600 --> 01:15:10.640
Okay, and so what we're doing now

01:15:10.640 --> 01:15:15.640
is lots of computational modeling,

01:15:16.680 --> 01:15:18.800
and actually using lots of ideas

01:15:18.800 --> 01:15:21.960
from connectionist machine learning

01:15:21.960 --> 01:15:23.480
to try and understand specifically

01:15:23.480 --> 01:15:25.880
how the electrical circuits that are in these planaria

01:15:25.880 --> 01:15:30.040
can store different types of target patterns

01:15:30.040 --> 01:15:31.520
and reconstruct those patterns

01:15:31.520 --> 01:15:34.080
even when the information has been damaged.

01:15:34.080 --> 01:15:39.080
Now, I've shown you this story about two heads and so on.

01:15:39.160 --> 01:15:41.440
It's not just about the number of heads.

01:15:41.440 --> 01:15:43.240
One other amazing thing you can do

01:15:43.240 --> 01:15:47.920
is push them to make heads of different species.

01:15:47.920 --> 01:15:50.520
So here is a planarian with a nice triangular head

01:15:50.520 --> 01:15:52.720
that's appropriate to his species.

01:15:52.720 --> 01:15:53.920
We can cut off that head,

01:15:53.960 --> 01:15:56.120
perturb the electrical network topology,

01:15:56.120 --> 01:15:57.440
let them settle back down.

01:15:57.440 --> 01:15:59.440
And when they regenerate their heads,

01:15:59.440 --> 01:16:00.760
sometimes they make the normal head,

01:16:00.760 --> 01:16:02.200
but sometimes they make round heads

01:16:02.200 --> 01:16:03.640
like this S-Mediterranean.

01:16:03.640 --> 01:16:06.560
Sometimes they make flat heads like this Pifelina.

01:16:06.560 --> 01:16:07.800
Again, no genetic change here.

01:16:07.800 --> 01:16:09.880
This has nothing to do with rewiring the hardware.

01:16:09.880 --> 01:16:12.200
What it is is pushing that same machine

01:16:12.200 --> 01:16:15.440
into other attractors in that enormous space

01:16:15.440 --> 01:16:18.280
of morphogenetic configurations

01:16:18.280 --> 01:16:19.680
that they're able to traverse.

01:16:19.680 --> 01:16:20.840
They're normally very good

01:16:20.840 --> 01:16:22.760
at going exactly where they need to go,

01:16:22.760 --> 01:16:25.920
but they can in fact visit other regions of that state space

01:16:25.920 --> 01:16:27.720
that normally belong to other species.

01:16:27.720 --> 01:16:28.640
And not just the head shape,

01:16:28.640 --> 01:16:31.640
but also the shape of the brain,

01:16:31.640 --> 01:16:33.080
the distribution of stem cells,

01:16:33.080 --> 01:16:34.440
just like these other species,

01:16:34.440 --> 01:16:38.000
150 to 100 million years distance.

01:16:38.000 --> 01:16:41.200
So again, this notion of reprogrammable biological hardware,

01:16:41.200 --> 01:16:43.440
they can do other things beyond the default

01:16:43.440 --> 01:16:44.800
that they normally do.

01:16:44.800 --> 01:16:46.960
And by the way, they can go even further

01:16:46.960 --> 01:16:50.560
into the latent morphospace of a typical planarian

01:16:50.560 --> 01:16:53.360
and Darcy Thompson as early as 1917,

01:16:53.360 --> 01:16:55.960
he had this notion of living beings

01:16:55.960 --> 01:17:00.240
exploring various kinds of mathematical morphospace.

01:17:00.240 --> 01:17:02.800
You can make them go further than a typical planarian

01:17:02.800 --> 01:17:05.720
and you can make these things that are sort of,

01:17:05.720 --> 01:17:06.840
they're not flat anymore.

01:17:06.840 --> 01:17:08.360
They're round and cylindrical

01:17:08.360 --> 01:17:09.480
and they're sort of hybrid shapes

01:17:09.480 --> 01:17:11.720
or these crazy spiky things.

01:17:11.720 --> 01:17:13.840
These wild type cells are capable

01:17:13.840 --> 01:17:15.840
of building lots of different stuff.

01:17:15.840 --> 01:17:19.200
And so what we're doing now is really trying

01:17:19.200 --> 01:17:21.400
to make these full stack computational models

01:17:21.400 --> 01:17:24.360
that go all the way from the lowest level molecular details

01:17:24.360 --> 01:17:27.200
of which genes are turned on and off.

01:17:27.200 --> 01:17:32.200
And then build the models of the bioelectric states,

01:17:34.000 --> 01:17:37.560
the cellular and tissue-wide bioelectric states

01:17:37.560 --> 01:17:39.080
that result from these ion channels

01:17:39.080 --> 01:17:44.080
and eventually all the way up to body-wide decisions

01:17:44.400 --> 01:17:46.120
and algorithms, which is what you need

01:17:46.120 --> 01:17:47.520
for that anatomical compiler

01:17:47.520 --> 01:17:48.920
that I talked about at the beginning,

01:17:48.960 --> 01:17:50.320
which is to understand how the tissue

01:17:50.320 --> 01:17:51.680
is actually making decisions

01:17:51.680 --> 01:17:53.800
about large scale shape, number of heads,

01:17:53.800 --> 01:17:55.560
type of heads and so on.

01:17:55.560 --> 01:17:57.880
Okay, so just a couple more minutes

01:17:57.880 --> 01:17:59.040
and then we'll take another break.

01:17:59.040 --> 01:18:00.920
I just, the last thing I wanna show you here

01:18:00.920 --> 01:18:05.920
is a biomedical intervention that emerges

01:18:06.920 --> 01:18:08.680
from this kind of approach.

01:18:08.680 --> 01:18:11.400
And it has to do with fixing frog brains.

01:18:11.400 --> 01:18:13.000
So here's a normal tadpole brain,

01:18:13.000 --> 01:18:14.520
here's the forebrain, here's the midbrain,

01:18:14.520 --> 01:18:16.880
here's the hindbrain, this is the normal structure.

01:18:16.880 --> 01:18:21.320
And if you expose these guys to various teratogens

01:18:21.320 --> 01:18:25.200
like nicotine, what you'll see is alcohol, nicotine,

01:18:25.200 --> 01:18:26.040
lots of different things.

01:18:26.040 --> 01:18:29.720
What you'll see is that a real defect in brain formation,

01:18:29.720 --> 01:18:31.080
the eyes are connected to the brain,

01:18:31.080 --> 01:18:33.200
the forebrain is basically missing,

01:18:33.200 --> 01:18:34.880
lots of problems here.

01:18:34.880 --> 01:18:35.840
And so we wanted to know,

01:18:35.840 --> 01:18:37.440
well, how would you fix something like this?

01:18:37.440 --> 01:18:39.720
It's very complex, we don't wanna try to tell

01:18:39.720 --> 01:18:41.880
every cell what to do, how do we fix this?

01:18:41.880 --> 01:18:46.880
And so Alexis Pytak, who's a member

01:18:47.240 --> 01:18:48.280
of our Allen Discovery Center,

01:18:48.280 --> 01:18:50.640
made this computational model.

01:18:50.640 --> 01:18:55.240
And with FiveHalfPy, who's a staff scientist in the group,

01:18:55.240 --> 01:18:56.480
they simply asked the question,

01:18:56.480 --> 01:19:00.100
what underlies the bioelectric gradients

01:19:00.100 --> 01:19:02.840
that normally tell the cells how big and normal,

01:19:02.840 --> 01:19:04.880
and what shape a normal brain should be?

01:19:04.880 --> 01:19:06.640
And so when you have a model like this,

01:19:06.640 --> 01:19:08.680
you can ask it questions and you can say,

01:19:08.680 --> 01:19:10.680
well, if the pattern is incorrect,

01:19:10.720 --> 01:19:12.880
what would we have to do to make it correct?

01:19:12.880 --> 01:19:16.920
And so the model gave us an answer.

01:19:16.920 --> 01:19:19.960
It said, well, there's this particular channel called HCN2.

01:19:19.960 --> 01:19:21.640
And if you were to open that up,

01:19:21.640 --> 01:19:23.520
it would be, the pattern would be restored

01:19:23.520 --> 01:19:24.640
and the cells would know what to do.

01:19:24.640 --> 01:19:26.200
And so here's an example,

01:19:26.200 --> 01:19:29.640
and this is actually a much more difficult case

01:19:29.640 --> 01:19:31.760
than that teratogen case I showed you.

01:19:31.760 --> 01:19:33.580
This is a notch mutation.

01:19:33.580 --> 01:19:37.800
So notch is a really critical neurogenesis gene

01:19:37.800 --> 01:19:38.720
in the absence of notch.

01:19:38.720 --> 01:19:39.800
You can see the brain is,

01:19:39.800 --> 01:19:41.600
the forebrain is gone, the midbrain and hindbrain

01:19:41.600 --> 01:19:42.780
are a big bubble full of water.

01:19:42.780 --> 01:19:45.400
I mean, these animals are profoundly affected.

01:19:45.400 --> 01:19:48.160
But even though that notch mutation is there,

01:19:48.160 --> 01:19:51.320
if you force the cells to have the correct bioelectrical

01:19:51.320 --> 01:19:53.520
pattern by using the strategy given to us

01:19:53.520 --> 01:19:56.320
by the computational model, the brain becomes normal.

01:19:56.320 --> 01:20:00.000
So they get their shape of the brain back,

01:20:00.000 --> 01:20:01.000
they get gene expression back,

01:20:01.000 --> 01:20:02.520
and they get their IQs back.

01:20:04.200 --> 01:20:07.160
Their learning rates are indistinguishable from controls.

01:20:07.160 --> 01:20:08.920
So this is an amazing example

01:20:08.920 --> 01:20:13.920
of not only instructively repairing complex defects

01:20:15.520 --> 01:20:16.800
using this bioelectrical approach,

01:20:16.800 --> 01:20:20.440
but specifically fixing a hardware defect in software.

01:20:20.440 --> 01:20:21.480
And I'm not saying that's gonna work

01:20:21.480 --> 01:20:23.920
for all genetic defects.

01:20:23.920 --> 01:20:25.120
There are many things that bioelectrics

01:20:25.120 --> 01:20:26.280
are not gonna work for,

01:20:26.280 --> 01:20:28.360
but it's again, this idea of plasticity.

01:20:28.360 --> 01:20:32.760
The idea is that broken hardware is not the end of the line,

01:20:32.760 --> 01:20:34.160
that if the algorithm is good,

01:20:34.160 --> 01:20:36.480
which for example, in Plenary, it's absolutely amazing,

01:20:36.480 --> 01:20:37.640
if the algorithm is good,

01:20:37.640 --> 01:20:39.560
you can often get around these defects

01:20:39.560 --> 01:20:41.560
and still get to where you need to go

01:20:41.560 --> 01:20:43.640
if you can remember what the correct pattern is.

01:20:43.640 --> 01:20:48.240
And so the biomedical roadmap looks roughly like this.

01:20:48.240 --> 01:20:50.160
We're making this sort of turnkey system

01:20:51.160 --> 01:20:53.600
where, and you can sort of play with parts of it

01:20:53.600 --> 01:20:55.480
or already online,

01:20:55.480 --> 01:20:59.240
where you know what the incorrect pattern currently is,

01:20:59.240 --> 01:21:02.400
you should know what the correct pattern is,

01:21:02.400 --> 01:21:04.640
and this is something that we're still working on

01:21:04.640 --> 01:21:06.760
to acquire these physiomic data sets.

01:21:06.760 --> 01:21:09.200
And then the model can actually tell you

01:21:09.200 --> 01:21:11.920
which channels and pumps to trigger,

01:21:11.920 --> 01:21:14.600
so how to communicate your anatomical goals

01:21:14.600 --> 01:21:16.200
to that set of cells.

01:21:16.200 --> 01:21:18.160
And then of course, once you know which channels,

01:21:18.160 --> 01:21:21.560
then it's pretty easy to pick drugs that you already know.

01:21:21.560 --> 01:21:26.160
So looking forward,

01:21:26.160 --> 01:21:29.320
the impact on biomedicine

01:21:29.320 --> 01:21:31.760
is to complement all of this,

01:21:31.760 --> 01:21:35.160
all of these current kind of technologies,

01:21:35.160 --> 01:21:38.600
so surgery, transplants, stem cells, genomic editing,

01:21:38.600 --> 01:21:41.080
rewriting, gene regulatory networks,

01:21:42.360 --> 01:21:45.120
molecular drugs that target proteins and so on.

01:21:45.120 --> 01:21:46.560
All of these things are bottom up,

01:21:46.560 --> 01:21:47.480
they're micromanagement,

01:21:47.480 --> 01:21:48.920
they're targeting the pathways

01:21:48.920 --> 01:21:51.000
to exactly do what you need to do.

01:21:51.000 --> 01:21:52.000
You can complement that

01:21:52.000 --> 01:21:54.760
by taking advantage of the tissue intelligence.

01:21:54.760 --> 01:21:56.400
And so we've talked about,

01:21:56.400 --> 01:21:57.240
in this part of the talk,

01:21:57.240 --> 01:21:58.600
we've talked about many examples

01:21:58.600 --> 01:22:00.920
of cells and tissues solving problems.

01:22:00.920 --> 01:22:05.080
They can find new ways to deal with physiological challenges,

01:22:05.080 --> 01:22:07.760
to with anatomical challenges,

01:22:07.760 --> 01:22:09.160
and with gene expression challenges.

01:22:09.160 --> 01:22:11.160
So they have various competencies,

01:22:11.160 --> 01:22:13.840
they can recruit neighbors as needed,

01:22:13.840 --> 01:22:17.400
they can find different paths to the same outcome.

01:22:17.400 --> 01:22:21.640
And if we can sort of take advantage of all those subroutines

01:22:21.640 --> 01:22:23.840
through either cell training or tissue training

01:22:23.840 --> 01:22:26.440
or various kinds of other triggers,

01:22:26.440 --> 01:22:27.920
which we call morphosuticals

01:22:27.920 --> 01:22:30.280
and the subset of electrosuticals,

01:22:30.280 --> 01:22:31.720
then I think,

01:22:31.720 --> 01:22:33.120
and you can find all the details here,

01:22:33.120 --> 01:22:35.880
really transformative types of regenerative medicine

01:22:35.880 --> 01:22:36.720
are gonna be available.

01:22:36.720 --> 01:22:39.240
And I think that overall,

01:22:40.040 --> 01:22:42.360
and possibly surprising nobody who works

01:22:42.360 --> 01:22:47.360
in these sorts of traditional alternative medicine modalities,

01:22:48.240 --> 01:22:49.840
the future of this approach

01:22:49.840 --> 01:22:53.080
is gonna look a lot more like a kind of somatic psychiatry

01:22:53.080 --> 01:22:54.400
than it is like chemistry.

01:22:54.400 --> 01:22:57.880
Because bioelectricity is that interface layer

01:22:57.880 --> 01:23:00.480
that enables top-down controls,

01:23:00.480 --> 01:23:02.840
in other words, memories of global patterns

01:23:02.840 --> 01:23:04.320
in various spaces,

01:23:04.320 --> 01:23:07.400
to filter down to the molecular machinery

01:23:07.400 --> 01:23:09.200
that actually activates them.

01:23:09.200 --> 01:23:12.520
And so that's something that's really quite unique

01:23:12.520 --> 01:23:13.840
to this bioelectrical layer.

01:23:13.840 --> 01:23:15.960
And it's not just some, this is important to mention,

01:23:15.960 --> 01:23:18.080
it's not just some rare thing that works

01:23:18.080 --> 01:23:23.080
in the case of hypnodermatology and mind body medicine

01:23:23.760 --> 01:23:26.960
and weird altered states and biofeedback.

01:23:26.960 --> 01:23:29.560
It works 24-7 in your body.

01:23:29.560 --> 01:23:31.480
When you decide in the morning,

01:23:31.480 --> 01:23:33.400
you wake up and you decide that you're going to work,

01:23:33.400 --> 01:23:37.840
that high-level cognitive intent

01:23:37.840 --> 01:23:39.200
of what you want to do

01:23:39.200 --> 01:23:41.000
has to depolarize your muscle cells

01:23:41.000 --> 01:23:42.680
for you to be able to get out of bed.

01:23:42.680 --> 01:23:46.000
So voluntary behavior is already showing you

01:23:46.000 --> 01:23:47.200
this mind-body connection,

01:23:47.200 --> 01:23:50.320
this idea that these high-level executive cognitive goals

01:23:50.920 --> 01:23:52.600
have to eventually trickle down

01:23:52.600 --> 01:23:54.520
to control molecular events in your muscles

01:23:54.520 --> 01:23:55.360
and in your glands.

01:23:55.360 --> 01:23:58.520
So this is the way our bodies work as a multi-scale system

01:23:58.520 --> 01:24:01.600
all the way from high-level cognitive structures

01:24:01.600 --> 01:24:03.880
down to the molecular pathways.

01:24:03.880 --> 01:24:07.080
And bioelectricity is the layer that does that.

01:24:07.080 --> 01:24:09.560
So I'm going to call a break now.

01:24:09.560 --> 01:24:12.320
Let's take a couple of minutes.

01:24:12.320 --> 01:24:14.160
Everybody gets some water.

01:24:14.160 --> 01:24:15.520
I'm going to be back in about three minutes

01:24:15.520 --> 01:24:17.760
and then people can ask questions.

01:24:18.760 --> 01:24:20.760
But take a break for a few here.

01:24:20.760 --> 01:24:21.840
All right, I'm back.

01:24:21.840 --> 01:24:24.000
If anybody wants to start asking questions.

01:24:25.400 --> 01:24:28.840
Yes, I can see Matthew's got his hand up already.

01:24:31.440 --> 01:24:32.800
Great, thank you.

01:24:34.760 --> 01:24:36.400
Hey, Michael, thanks so much for this

01:24:37.640 --> 01:24:40.360
really astonishing research that you're doing.

01:24:40.360 --> 01:24:42.200
This is wonderful to listen to.

01:24:44.400 --> 01:24:45.680
I know you're a scientist,

01:24:45.960 --> 01:24:49.080
but I think you're also verging

01:24:49.080 --> 01:24:51.760
on some deep philosophical questions here.

01:24:51.760 --> 01:24:55.880
And so I want to ask you if you think that the work

01:24:55.880 --> 01:25:00.000
that you're doing, showing the work

01:25:00.000 --> 01:25:01.600
that these bioelectric fields do,

01:25:01.600 --> 01:25:04.480
it's obviously challenging a certain kind of reductionism.

01:25:06.200 --> 01:25:09.240
But do you think there's a new philosophy of nature

01:25:10.520 --> 01:25:14.960
opening up as you push the frontiers of biological science?

01:25:14.960 --> 01:25:17.760
And what I mean here is, particularly,

01:25:17.760 --> 01:25:21.280
to give an example on the question of memory,

01:25:22.920 --> 01:25:26.920
it seems to me that the distributed memory

01:25:26.920 --> 01:25:31.920
that you're finding in multicellular organisms

01:25:32.320 --> 01:25:34.840
seems to suggest something more along the lines

01:25:34.840 --> 01:25:36.440
of the philosophy of nature

01:25:36.440 --> 01:25:41.440
that Bergson or Whitehead would suggest

01:25:41.440 --> 01:25:45.040
where memory is not as the scientific materialist

01:25:45.040 --> 01:25:46.640
philosophy of nature would suggest something

01:25:46.640 --> 01:25:50.520
that's memory could only be something stored

01:25:50.520 --> 01:25:51.960
through some material trace.

01:25:53.280 --> 01:25:55.280
What Bergson, Whitehead and other thinkers

01:25:55.280 --> 01:26:00.280
in that vein would say is that to understand memory

01:26:01.440 --> 01:26:05.840
or consciousness, you really need to see nature

01:26:05.840 --> 01:26:10.840
as this process of what Whitehead would call accumulation

01:26:11.120 --> 01:26:14.800
so that the past is inherited in the present

01:26:17.600 --> 01:26:22.320
and it's still present, the past is present in other words,

01:26:22.320 --> 01:26:24.120
it's not gone, it's not somewhere else,

01:26:24.120 --> 01:26:27.640
it doesn't need to be recorded on some material medium

01:26:27.640 --> 01:26:30.280
necessarily, though of course traces are left

01:26:30.280 --> 01:26:33.240
as nature accumulates in this process of growth.

01:26:34.400 --> 01:26:37.400
And so it seems to me that memory therefore becomes something

01:26:37.400 --> 01:26:39.800
that if we're gonna talk about how or where is it stored,

01:26:40.520 --> 01:26:43.120
it's stored everywhere, not only in the organism

01:26:43.120 --> 01:26:45.920
within the skin boundary of the organism

01:26:45.920 --> 01:26:48.240
but the whole environment is in some sense

01:26:48.240 --> 01:26:51.240
storing the memory if we wanna think of it that way.

01:26:51.240 --> 01:26:53.680
You take the organism out of its environment,

01:26:53.680 --> 01:26:57.240
is it really gonna be able to produce the form

01:26:57.240 --> 01:27:00.720
that we would think it's remembering,

01:27:00.720 --> 01:27:03.400
because it depends on all this environmental context

01:27:03.400 --> 01:27:04.720
to do what it does.

01:27:04.720 --> 01:27:07.040
And so yeah, that's one example of what a new philosophy

01:27:07.040 --> 01:27:08.800
of nature might suggest as regards to memory

01:27:08.800 --> 01:27:11.720
but how do you see your work venturing

01:27:11.720 --> 01:27:14.960
into these deeper philosophical questions?

01:27:14.960 --> 01:27:19.960
Yeah, so let's say this, I think that the right way

01:27:20.840 --> 01:27:25.840
to think about the relationship between the experiments

01:27:26.000 --> 01:27:29.960
and all of that and these different philosophical takes

01:27:29.960 --> 01:27:33.800
is as a set of, so my framework you can in fact,

01:27:33.800 --> 01:27:36.080
you can see it here, it's called the TAME,

01:27:36.120 --> 01:27:40.240
technological approach to mind everywhere.

01:27:40.240 --> 01:27:43.440
And the reason that I emphasize technological

01:27:43.440 --> 01:27:48.440
is that I want the philosophical concepts

01:27:48.480 --> 01:27:50.840
to be testable and to do specific work.

01:27:50.840 --> 01:27:54.440
In other words, what I am looking for

01:27:54.440 --> 01:27:57.560
is for different lenses or different ways

01:27:57.560 --> 01:28:02.160
of looking at these phenomena that facilitate progress.

01:28:02.160 --> 01:28:07.160
So a philosophical worldview is to me is useful

01:28:07.320 --> 01:28:10.680
to the extent that it can be applied to the things we do

01:28:10.680 --> 01:28:12.700
to drive new discoveries, new capabilities

01:28:12.700 --> 01:28:14.720
to drive a research program basically.

01:28:14.720 --> 01:28:18.720
So the reality is I've borrowed in order to make all

01:28:18.720 --> 01:28:22.840
of these kind of new findings and that my lab has found

01:28:24.200 --> 01:28:27.480
these were done because we borrowed from all kinds

01:28:27.480 --> 01:28:29.760
of unusual ways of thinking about the world

01:28:29.760 --> 01:28:32.000
that are not standard in the field.

01:28:32.000 --> 01:28:35.800
And so to that extent, I do think we absolutely interface

01:28:35.800 --> 01:28:39.400
with interesting different philosophical views

01:28:39.400 --> 01:28:42.000
be they, you know, Berberxen or whoever else.

01:28:42.840 --> 01:28:46.120
But that's it for, that's what I'm looking for.

01:28:46.120 --> 01:28:50.240
So for example, on the specific example that you mentioned,

01:28:50.240 --> 01:28:52.920
if you say that memory is sort of everywhere,

01:28:52.920 --> 01:28:57.160
that's fine, I suspect that has a lot of value to it.

01:28:57.160 --> 01:28:59.120
The next question is, okay, how do we turn that

01:28:59.120 --> 01:29:04.120
into a specific intervention that shows us to be able

01:29:04.120 --> 01:29:05.360
to do something that you could not do

01:29:05.360 --> 01:29:07.000
if you didn't have that worldview.

01:29:07.000 --> 01:29:10.480
So that's where the rubber has to meet the road

01:29:10.480 --> 01:29:15.480
in terms of facilitating experimental advances

01:29:15.640 --> 01:29:19.080
and finding new research.

01:29:19.080 --> 01:29:22.040
So I think that's a longer, we can have a whole other

01:29:22.040 --> 01:29:24.600
discussion about where I've borrowed a lot of this stuff

01:29:24.600 --> 01:29:28.000
from because it is interesting, but everything to me,

01:29:28.040 --> 01:29:31.640
everything has to eventually interface strongly

01:29:31.640 --> 01:29:33.840
with the research enterprise.

01:29:37.800 --> 01:29:38.640
Thank you.

01:29:38.640 --> 01:29:39.480
Let's do one more.

01:29:42.360 --> 01:29:44.680
Don't see any hands up yet,

01:29:44.680 --> 01:29:47.600
but also given the time to be, we can carry on.

01:29:47.600 --> 01:29:50.160
Yeah, let's keep going and then I'll do the last part

01:29:50.160 --> 01:29:53.440
and then we can talk about whatever people want at the end.

01:29:53.440 --> 01:29:57.800
Okay, so in this final part, I wanna come back to,

01:29:58.640 --> 01:29:59.800
so let's remember where we were.

01:29:59.800 --> 01:30:03.680
We started out acknowledging this kind of multi-scale

01:30:03.680 --> 01:30:07.800
architecture of the body and trying to widen this idea

01:30:07.800 --> 01:30:11.760
of intelligence towards a continuum of competency

01:30:11.760 --> 01:30:13.560
from very simple kinds of things,

01:30:13.560 --> 01:30:17.180
too much more complex things in diverse problem spaces.

01:30:17.180 --> 01:30:20.160
And so, and then we went through some very specific

01:30:20.160 --> 01:30:24.200
examples of bioelectricity as a kind of cognitive glue

01:30:24.200 --> 01:30:28.200
that holds together these competent components,

01:30:28.200 --> 01:30:31.000
for example, cells and allows the collective to solve

01:30:31.000 --> 01:30:32.920
problems in morphogenetic space

01:30:32.920 --> 01:30:35.280
and the implications for biomedicine.

01:30:35.280 --> 01:30:38.600
I wanna circle back kind of to a somewhat more

01:30:38.600 --> 01:30:42.400
philosophical aspect to really start to dig into

01:30:42.400 --> 01:30:45.640
what does it mean to be an agent or a self

01:30:45.640 --> 01:30:49.080
and how does it work that components are able

01:30:49.080 --> 01:30:51.720
to make these emergent cells?

01:30:51.720 --> 01:30:54.180
And then I wanna show you some novel organisms

01:30:54.180 --> 01:30:57.580
as a kind of tool with which to explore this latent space

01:30:57.580 --> 01:30:59.380
that I've been hinting at.

01:30:59.380 --> 01:31:02.140
So, here we go.

01:31:04.180 --> 01:31:07.420
Remember back to the original kind of goal

01:31:07.420 --> 01:31:11.340
for this framework was to be able to think about

01:31:11.340 --> 01:31:15.980
very diverse kinds of agents all in the same space.

01:31:15.980 --> 01:31:19.980
So how do we think about synthetic beings

01:31:19.980 --> 01:31:23.140
and possible aliens and cells and tissues and humans

01:31:23.980 --> 01:31:27.420
and birds and everything else kind of on the same,

01:31:27.420 --> 01:31:28.620
using the same framework.

01:31:28.620 --> 01:31:30.980
And so, and so what I come up with was this notion

01:31:30.980 --> 01:31:32.660
of a cognitive light cone.

01:31:32.660 --> 01:31:34.420
So cognitive light cone, which is shown here

01:31:34.420 --> 01:31:37.540
and this is kind of a, if anybody's into physics

01:31:37.540 --> 01:31:39.540
you'll recognize this is a kind of upside down

01:31:39.540 --> 01:31:43.100
Mankowski cone where space, all the three dimensions

01:31:43.100 --> 01:31:45.180
of space are collapsed onto this axis

01:31:45.180 --> 01:31:47.220
and time is on this axis.

01:31:47.220 --> 01:31:50.380
And what the cognitive light cone is,

01:31:50.580 --> 01:31:54.660
is simply the size of the largest goal

01:31:54.660 --> 01:31:56.620
that a given system can work towards.

01:31:56.620 --> 01:31:58.620
So not how far away can it sense

01:31:58.620 --> 01:32:00.100
or how far away can it act,

01:32:00.100 --> 01:32:03.420
but the size of the largest goal state that it can pursue.

01:32:03.420 --> 01:32:06.260
So if all you care about is the local concentration

01:32:06.260 --> 01:32:08.460
of sucrose, then maybe you're a bacterium

01:32:08.460 --> 01:32:10.500
and you've got a tiny little cognitive light cone

01:32:10.500 --> 01:32:11.740
that has a tiny bit of memory

01:32:11.740 --> 01:32:13.700
from what the concentration was 20 minutes ago,

01:32:13.700 --> 01:32:16.700
a little bit of predictive capacity and that's it.

01:32:16.700 --> 01:32:19.940
If you are something like a dog,

01:32:19.940 --> 01:32:22.100
well, you have a lot more memory going backwards,

01:32:22.100 --> 01:32:23.980
more predictive power going forwards.

01:32:23.980 --> 01:32:26.140
You have the ability to have the goal

01:32:26.140 --> 01:32:28.780
of let's say protecting the whole sort of property.

01:32:28.780 --> 01:32:30.780
So you have some idea of the size of a yard

01:32:30.780 --> 01:32:32.140
and what's going on,

01:32:32.140 --> 01:32:34.660
but you're never going to care about what happens

01:32:34.660 --> 01:32:37.420
three times, three towns over a month from now.

01:32:37.420 --> 01:32:39.660
It's just that that's too far in the future

01:32:39.660 --> 01:32:42.420
and also in space for that cognitive, as far as we know

01:32:42.420 --> 01:32:45.340
for that cognitive system to have any of that as a goal.

01:32:45.340 --> 01:32:47.740
If you're a human, you could have an absolutely enormous

01:32:47.740 --> 01:32:50.820
light cone where you might be working towards world peace

01:32:50.820 --> 01:32:52.100
over the next hundred years

01:32:52.100 --> 01:32:54.260
and you could have these very large light cones.

01:32:54.260 --> 01:32:56.940
And by the way, you have the added psychological pressure

01:32:56.940 --> 01:32:59.500
of knowing for a fact that some of your goals

01:32:59.500 --> 01:33:01.980
are not achievable in your lifetime

01:33:01.980 --> 01:33:03.820
because your cognitive light cone is bigger

01:33:03.820 --> 01:33:08.580
than your actual survival, your possible survival.

01:33:08.580 --> 01:33:10.420
So if you're a goldfish, you don't have that problem.

01:33:10.420 --> 01:33:14.900
All your goals are achievable in your lifetime

01:33:14.900 --> 01:33:17.940
because they're all very kind of short path.

01:33:17.940 --> 01:33:22.140
And of course, as maybe it was Beth or somebody had pointed out

01:33:22.140 --> 01:33:25.620
that we are of course compound intelligences

01:33:25.620 --> 01:33:27.140
because we are made of components

01:33:27.140 --> 01:33:28.940
with their own little cognitive light cones

01:33:28.940 --> 01:33:30.180
in their own spaces.

01:33:30.180 --> 01:33:34.820
So we are this huge patchwork of compound intelligences

01:33:34.820 --> 01:33:38.220
all of which see different worlds in different spaces

01:33:38.220 --> 01:33:40.580
and are all cooperating and competing and so on

01:33:40.580 --> 01:33:42.620
both across and within levels.

01:33:42.620 --> 01:33:44.140
So with this notion,

01:33:44.180 --> 01:33:45.540
let's think about a few things.

01:33:45.540 --> 01:33:48.300
First of all, let's go back to this idea

01:33:48.300 --> 01:33:49.780
of a collective intelligence.

01:33:49.780 --> 01:33:54.780
So if somebody shows you a human brain,

01:33:55.260 --> 01:33:57.900
if you didn't already know what a human look like

01:33:57.900 --> 01:33:58.980
and maybe even if you did

01:33:58.980 --> 01:34:00.500
because it's not an obvious question

01:34:00.500 --> 01:34:03.100
and somebody asks you, how many individuals are in there?

01:34:03.100 --> 01:34:05.100
How many selves are in there?

01:34:05.100 --> 01:34:08.660
And it leads to the fact that we do not know actually

01:34:08.660 --> 01:34:10.900
how much brain matter it takes

01:34:10.900 --> 01:34:13.260
to support a single human self.

01:34:13.260 --> 01:34:15.340
I mean, we see the normal case,

01:34:15.340 --> 01:34:18.340
but this leads to people saying things like,

01:34:18.340 --> 01:34:20.540
wow, with such a, for a B or something like that

01:34:20.540 --> 01:34:22.500
with such a tiny brain, it does a,

01:34:22.500 --> 01:34:26.620
well, we don't know how much it takes to be a single self.

01:34:26.620 --> 01:34:28.740
We don't have any way of guessing what that's gonna be

01:34:28.740 --> 01:34:30.580
until you already know what a human is.

01:34:30.580 --> 01:34:32.460
So let's look at this example.

01:34:32.460 --> 01:34:36.020
This is a schematic of an early blastoderm

01:34:36.020 --> 01:34:40.260
of an amniote embryo, let's say it's a bird or a human.

01:34:40.260 --> 01:34:41.660
And what you see is a bunch of cells.

01:34:41.660 --> 01:34:44.420
There's 50,000 cells and we look at that

01:34:44.420 --> 01:34:46.620
and we say, oh, there's an embryo.

01:34:46.620 --> 01:34:48.220
Now, what are we counting when we say

01:34:48.220 --> 01:34:49.460
there's one embryo there?

01:34:49.460 --> 01:34:50.900
What is there one of?

01:34:50.900 --> 01:34:52.740
There are tens of thousands of cells.

01:34:52.740 --> 01:34:53.940
What is there one of?

01:34:53.940 --> 01:34:56.380
What we're actually counting is alignment.

01:34:56.380 --> 01:34:58.380
We're counting the fact that all of these,

01:34:58.380 --> 01:35:00.100
and that alignment is literal

01:35:00.100 --> 01:35:02.180
because the cells physically have to align with each other

01:35:02.180 --> 01:35:04.800
and also alignment in morphogenetic space

01:35:04.800 --> 01:35:07.100
because all of these cells normally

01:35:07.100 --> 01:35:10.060
are going to work together to build one individual.

01:35:10.060 --> 01:35:11.940
They have one particular large scale pattern

01:35:11.940 --> 01:35:12.940
that they're all going to build

01:35:12.940 --> 01:35:15.300
and that is what we're counting as one.

01:35:15.300 --> 01:35:18.660
And now, could you guess in advance

01:35:18.660 --> 01:35:20.540
how many embryos there are

01:35:20.540 --> 01:35:23.020
or how many individuals are in this brain?

01:35:23.020 --> 01:35:25.020
It's a very similar as I was saying before

01:35:25.020 --> 01:35:27.740
with the Turing, the kind of allusion to Turing.

01:35:27.740 --> 01:35:29.700
It's a very similar problem.

01:35:29.700 --> 01:35:31.900
Can you tell how many are going to be in there?

01:35:31.900 --> 01:35:34.040
Is it genetically specified how many are in there?

01:35:34.040 --> 01:35:35.700
Well, the answer is it is not.

01:35:35.700 --> 01:35:39.940
So here's an experiment that Lutz first did

01:35:39.940 --> 01:35:42.220
in the 40s and I used to do as a grad student

01:35:42.220 --> 01:35:43.860
in the duck embryo.

01:35:43.860 --> 01:35:46.060
So what you can do is you can take a little needle

01:35:46.060 --> 01:35:48.860
and you can put some scratches in this blastoderm.

01:35:48.860 --> 01:35:50.120
And so what happens is that once you,

01:35:50.120 --> 01:35:51.980
when you made those little scratches

01:35:51.980 --> 01:35:53.700
until they heal up, which they will,

01:35:53.700 --> 01:35:56.400
but until they heal up, every region

01:35:56.400 --> 01:35:59.360
which does not feel the presence of these other regions

01:35:59.360 --> 01:36:00.220
becomes an embryo.

01:36:00.220 --> 01:36:03.200
It self-organizes an embryo and then it heals.

01:36:03.200 --> 01:36:05.640
And then what you have is multiple areas

01:36:05.640 --> 01:36:07.980
that are conjoined twins or triplets.

01:36:07.980 --> 01:36:09.420
And then in between them,

01:36:09.420 --> 01:36:11.660
you have these little weird little disputed zones

01:36:11.660 --> 01:36:13.820
where these cells can't quite tell who they belong to,

01:36:13.820 --> 01:36:15.220
but in the end they have to make a decision

01:36:15.220 --> 01:36:17.220
and they become part of this or part of that.

01:36:17.220 --> 01:36:21.500
And this is really, there are a couple

01:36:21.500 --> 01:36:22.340
of interesting things here.

01:36:22.340 --> 01:36:24.260
First of all, because of this,

01:36:24.260 --> 01:36:28.500
because you can split this up into some number of islands,

01:36:28.500 --> 01:36:31.580
the number of cells, just imagine this is a human embryo,

01:36:31.580 --> 01:36:35.020
the number of individuals in there is not fixed.

01:36:35.020 --> 01:36:37.380
It is not determined by the genetics.

01:36:37.380 --> 01:36:40.820
It is set in real time by the physiology.

01:36:40.820 --> 01:36:43.060
It could be zero, it could be one, it could be two,

01:36:43.060 --> 01:36:45.860
it could be some number of embryos,

01:36:45.860 --> 01:36:47.700
probably up to half a dozen, let's say.

01:36:48.780 --> 01:36:53.780
And it's very important for the making of cells

01:36:55.140 --> 01:36:57.340
that they are self-organized,

01:36:57.340 --> 01:36:58.580
meaning that they don't know,

01:36:58.580 --> 01:37:00.780
each cell does not know where it,

01:37:00.780 --> 01:37:05.080
where every cell is some other cells external environment.

01:37:05.080 --> 01:37:07.680
So where do I end and my neighbor begins?

01:37:07.680 --> 01:37:10.720
Or where do I end and the outside world begins?

01:37:10.720 --> 01:37:11.960
This is something that is not true

01:37:11.960 --> 01:37:15.920
for almost any current AI or robotic system,

01:37:15.920 --> 01:37:17.920
because they don't have to put themselves together

01:37:17.920 --> 01:37:19.880
from scratch, they are told right from the beginning,

01:37:19.880 --> 01:37:20.720
they're programmed to say,

01:37:20.720 --> 01:37:22.080
this is your border, here are the inputs,

01:37:22.080 --> 01:37:23.920
here are the outputs, you are here,

01:37:23.920 --> 01:37:25.200
the outside world is there.

01:37:25.200 --> 01:37:26.920
That is not the case for living beings.

01:37:26.920 --> 01:37:30.720
We have to self-construct and we do not know right away

01:37:30.720 --> 01:37:32.840
where our borders are, how many of us are in there

01:37:32.840 --> 01:37:33.680
and so on.

01:37:34.680 --> 01:37:37.080
This also taking it back to the brain, of course,

01:37:37.080 --> 01:37:39.200
is this issue of individuation,

01:37:39.200 --> 01:37:41.880
because in split brain patients

01:37:41.880 --> 01:37:43.680
and dissociative disorders and so on,

01:37:43.680 --> 01:37:46.840
you find out that there actually are more than one self

01:37:46.840 --> 01:37:48.520
within a standard human brain,

01:37:48.520 --> 01:37:50.800
how many could fit in there, we do not know,

01:37:50.800 --> 01:37:54.320
but the record for these dissociative kind of cases,

01:37:54.320 --> 01:37:57.120
I mean, I think I've read in the 60s,

01:37:57.120 --> 01:37:59.360
60 different personalities that could be in there.

01:37:59.440 --> 01:38:03.840
So this idea of an active medium,

01:38:03.840 --> 01:38:06.960
an excitable medium that differentiates

01:38:06.960 --> 01:38:11.960
into a number of coherent selves is really key.

01:38:12.680 --> 01:38:15.240
And so now you have to start asking yourself, okay,

01:38:15.240 --> 01:38:19.680
so as we are self-constructing out of this,

01:38:19.680 --> 01:38:22.960
sort of this Freudian ocean of possibility,

01:38:22.960 --> 01:38:25.480
some out of 20 or 50,000 cells,

01:38:25.480 --> 01:38:27.680
three or two or one embryo will form,

01:38:28.520 --> 01:38:33.120
what are the dynamics that actually allow individual cells

01:38:33.120 --> 01:38:34.960
with their own tiny little goals,

01:38:34.960 --> 01:38:36.080
what are the goals of cells?

01:38:36.080 --> 01:38:38.000
Well, every cell wants to become two cells

01:38:38.000 --> 01:38:39.440
and they have metabolic goals

01:38:39.440 --> 01:38:40.760
that they try to meet and so on.

01:38:40.760 --> 01:38:42.800
What allows them to scale up

01:38:42.800 --> 01:38:47.800
to work towards very sort of a large complex goals

01:38:48.680 --> 01:38:49.760
like building a whole embryo?

01:38:49.760 --> 01:38:50.600
I mean, that's huge.

01:38:50.600 --> 01:38:52.760
No individual cell can know what a whole embryo is,

01:38:52.760 --> 01:38:53.880
but the collective does.

01:38:53.880 --> 01:38:55.320
So what allows that?

01:38:55.320 --> 01:38:56.440
Well, here are some hypotheses.

01:38:56.440 --> 01:38:58.680
One thing that allows it, I think,

01:38:58.680 --> 01:39:00.960
is the kind of memory wiping that happens

01:39:00.960 --> 01:39:03.040
when cells are electrically connected.

01:39:03.040 --> 01:39:04.760
Because when two cells signal each other

01:39:04.760 --> 01:39:05.600
the old-fashioned way,

01:39:05.600 --> 01:39:07.720
where they just sort of secrete a chemical molecule

01:39:07.720 --> 01:39:09.680
and it comes over here and the cell senses it,

01:39:09.680 --> 01:39:11.240
it's very easy for this cell to know

01:39:11.240 --> 01:39:13.720
whether that signal came from the outside or not.

01:39:13.720 --> 01:39:14.680
So they can maintain,

01:39:14.680 --> 01:39:16.680
these two cells can maintain their individuality

01:39:16.680 --> 01:39:18.400
and they can maintain different memories

01:39:18.400 --> 01:39:19.920
and the cell can ignore the signal

01:39:19.920 --> 01:39:22.320
or do something about it, whatever.

01:39:22.320 --> 01:39:24.040
But there's something magic

01:39:24.040 --> 01:39:25.560
about these electrical gap junctions.

01:39:25.560 --> 01:39:28.600
When the cells are joined by these gap junctions,

01:39:28.600 --> 01:39:32.360
this signal, let's say it's a calcium spike

01:39:32.360 --> 01:39:33.200
from being injured.

01:39:33.200 --> 01:39:34.600
This cell got poked with something

01:39:34.600 --> 01:39:37.440
and this calcium spike is a trace of that event,

01:39:37.440 --> 01:39:39.320
a kind of a memory n-gram of that event.

01:39:39.320 --> 01:39:42.080
It will immediately propagate through these gap junctions

01:39:42.080 --> 01:39:45.480
and that the interpretation of that signal for this cell

01:39:47.440 --> 01:39:49.840
is exactly the same as it would before

01:39:49.840 --> 01:39:51.400
its own calcium spike.

01:39:51.400 --> 01:39:53.440
Calcium doesn't have any metadata on it

01:39:53.440 --> 01:39:54.960
that says, where did you come from?

01:39:55.000 --> 01:39:56.640
So by moving through this,

01:39:56.640 --> 01:39:58.520
there's a kind of memory,

01:39:58.520 --> 01:40:00.800
kind of identity wipe that happens

01:40:00.800 --> 01:40:03.080
where this cell now has that same memory trace.

01:40:03.080 --> 01:40:04.320
And as far as it's concerned,

01:40:04.320 --> 01:40:05.800
that's its own natural memory.

01:40:05.800 --> 01:40:08.280
It has no way of knowing that's a false memory.

01:40:08.280 --> 01:40:10.240
So to this cell, that's a false memory,

01:40:10.240 --> 01:40:11.560
but to the collective,

01:40:11.560 --> 01:40:14.840
it is an absolutely true memory that the collective had.

01:40:14.840 --> 01:40:17.000
So that kind of wiping property,

01:40:17.000 --> 01:40:19.160
it strips ownership information.

01:40:19.160 --> 01:40:22.320
It makes it very hard for each cell

01:40:22.320 --> 01:40:24.320
to maintain an individual identity

01:40:24.320 --> 01:40:26.040
with respect to what its history was.

01:40:26.040 --> 01:40:28.640
And it makes collectives out of individual cells.

01:40:28.640 --> 01:40:30.760
And of course it makes them bigger.

01:40:30.760 --> 01:40:32.760
So my memory become our memories,

01:40:32.760 --> 01:40:35.040
my stress state becomes our stress

01:40:35.040 --> 01:40:37.000
and my goal becomes our goal.

01:40:37.000 --> 01:40:41.040
And so by when a single cell in this diagram,

01:40:41.040 --> 01:40:44.240
when a single cell has some size of a cognitive light going

01:40:44.240 --> 01:40:46.800
and some ability to anticipate and remember,

01:40:46.800 --> 01:40:51.800
a network of these cells has a bigger computational capacity

01:40:52.320 --> 01:40:54.840
and a bigger spatial sensorium.

01:40:54.840 --> 01:40:57.440
And it can actually have larger scale,

01:40:57.440 --> 01:41:00.360
more complex states as set points.

01:41:00.360 --> 01:41:02.320
And now you can start to see how a collection of cells

01:41:02.320 --> 01:41:04.320
could actually work on something like building an arm

01:41:04.320 --> 01:41:06.000
or building a whole body.

01:41:06.000 --> 01:41:07.240
And so we can imagine,

01:41:07.240 --> 01:41:08.360
and so we're doing this now

01:41:08.360 --> 01:41:12.240
is doing these very specific computational models

01:41:12.240 --> 01:41:15.760
of how little tiny homeostatic loops like this,

01:41:15.760 --> 01:41:19.160
for example, measure the pH and act

01:41:19.160 --> 01:41:21.920
become very large homeostatic loops

01:41:21.920 --> 01:41:23.280
about something completely different.

01:41:23.280 --> 01:41:25.960
Single cells cannot remember anything like this,

01:41:25.960 --> 01:41:28.840
but a giant collection of cells could.

01:41:28.840 --> 01:41:30.720
And so this is a very active area of research

01:41:30.720 --> 01:41:33.760
is to figure out exactly how that scales up.

01:41:33.760 --> 01:41:36.760
The implications are these,

01:41:36.760 --> 01:41:38.240
here's what evolution has done.

01:41:38.240 --> 01:41:41.200
Evolution has enabled single cells to work together

01:41:41.200 --> 01:41:43.320
to enlarge their cognitive light cones

01:41:43.320 --> 01:41:47.240
where the goals scale from the very humble goals

01:41:47.280 --> 01:41:51.040
of single cells to the more grandiose goals of collectives

01:41:51.040 --> 01:41:52.960
where they can work on something gigantic

01:41:52.960 --> 01:41:54.640
like making sure you have four fingers.

01:41:54.640 --> 01:41:56.560
This cell doesn't know anything about what a finger is,

01:41:56.560 --> 01:41:58.440
but this collective does.

01:41:58.440 --> 01:42:00.080
So evolution gave us the scale up,

01:42:00.080 --> 01:42:01.800
but there's a failure mode to this.

01:42:01.800 --> 01:42:03.200
The failure mode is cancer.

01:42:03.200 --> 01:42:06.520
So here's where when these cells

01:42:06.520 --> 01:42:08.880
are electrically isolated from each other,

01:42:08.880 --> 01:42:12.080
this is human glioblastoma in culture.

01:42:12.080 --> 01:42:14.000
So these individual cells can roll back

01:42:14.000 --> 01:42:16.760
to their unicellular past.

01:42:16.760 --> 01:42:18.360
They do not become more selfish.

01:42:18.360 --> 01:42:20.800
A lot of game theory kind of approaches

01:42:20.800 --> 01:42:22.800
treat cancer cells as more selfish.

01:42:22.800 --> 01:42:24.120
They don't become more selfish.

01:42:24.120 --> 01:42:25.760
Their cells get smaller.

01:42:25.760 --> 01:42:26.600
They're just a selfish.

01:42:26.600 --> 01:42:28.440
It's just that the self here is huge.

01:42:28.440 --> 01:42:32.040
Their self is very tiny and they do the best they can.

01:42:32.040 --> 01:42:36.360
But biometically, if you have that kind of weird perspective

01:42:36.360 --> 01:42:39.920
on cancer as a disorder of selfhood,

01:42:39.920 --> 01:42:42.320
then what you can do is something interesting.

01:42:42.320 --> 01:42:44.720
And we did this years ago.

01:42:45.720 --> 01:42:48.880
You can induce tumors using human oncogenes,

01:42:48.880 --> 01:42:50.720
but what you can do is use these ion channels

01:42:50.720 --> 01:42:53.440
to force the cells to be in the correct electrical state

01:42:53.440 --> 01:42:55.520
to maintain proper communication.

01:42:55.520 --> 01:42:57.920
And when you do that, even though the oncogene is blazingly

01:42:57.920 --> 01:42:59.200
expressed, it's labeled in red here.

01:42:59.200 --> 01:43:00.760
You can see it's all over the place.

01:43:00.760 --> 01:43:01.440
There's no tumor.

01:43:01.440 --> 01:43:02.640
This is the same animal.

01:43:02.640 --> 01:43:06.280
There's no tumor because the genetics might have a defect.

01:43:06.280 --> 01:43:08.080
The hardware might be a little bit broken.

01:43:08.080 --> 01:43:10.520
But as long as the cell is physiologically

01:43:10.520 --> 01:43:13.520
part of this network that contains large scale

01:43:13.520 --> 01:43:16.720
goals like building nice skin, nice muscle, and so on,

01:43:16.720 --> 01:43:18.760
they're kept away from tumorogenesis

01:43:18.760 --> 01:43:22.880
and harness towards these large scale anatomical goals.

01:43:22.880 --> 01:43:27.800
So the last piece I want to show you, it goes beyond this.

01:43:27.800 --> 01:43:30.640
So we've been talking about goals in different spaces.

01:43:30.640 --> 01:43:33.760
So the tiny metabolic goals of single cells,

01:43:33.760 --> 01:43:37.560
the morphogenetic goals of cellular collectives.

01:43:37.560 --> 01:43:40.680
And now we can ask the following question.

01:43:40.680 --> 01:43:42.360
Where do these goals come from?

01:43:42.360 --> 01:43:45.760
And what other goals can novel beings have?

01:43:45.760 --> 01:43:47.480
And so this is a project that I also

01:43:47.480 --> 01:43:51.040
have to do a disclosure here because Josh Bongard and I

01:43:51.040 --> 01:43:53.200
have another company called Fauna Systems, which is all

01:43:53.200 --> 01:43:56.520
about AI-designed biorebotics.

01:43:56.520 --> 01:43:59.280
And this is all work done in collaboration

01:43:59.280 --> 01:44:02.680
with a Bongard lab at this Institute of Computationally

01:44:02.680 --> 01:44:04.520
Designed Organisms.

01:44:04.520 --> 01:44:08.120
We asked the following question, how much plasticity

01:44:08.120 --> 01:44:09.000
do these cells have?

01:44:09.000 --> 01:44:11.040
And when they're liberated from their normal boundary

01:44:11.040 --> 01:44:14.040
conditions of the animal, what will they do?

01:44:14.040 --> 01:44:15.920
How will they reboot multicellularity?

01:44:15.920 --> 01:44:19.120
How will they navigate anatomical and behavioral spaces?

01:44:19.120 --> 01:44:20.160
What can they do?

01:44:20.160 --> 01:44:22.240
So here's the experiment.

01:44:22.240 --> 01:44:24.720
And all the biology here was done by Douglas Blackest

01:44:24.720 --> 01:44:26.280
and the staff scientists in the group.

01:44:26.280 --> 01:44:28.520
What we did was we took an early frog embryo.

01:44:28.520 --> 01:44:33.480
And at this stage, where they have about 1,000 cells or so,

01:44:33.480 --> 01:44:39.000
we cut off these cells up here, which are the skin.

01:44:39.000 --> 01:44:41.960
This is all faded to be skin cells.

01:44:41.960 --> 01:44:45.920
And we dissociated them and we put them back

01:44:45.920 --> 01:44:48.000
in this little depression here.

01:44:48.000 --> 01:44:49.560
And so they're just skin.

01:44:49.560 --> 01:44:50.080
There's no nerve.

01:44:50.080 --> 01:44:51.800
There's no muscle, just skin.

01:44:51.800 --> 01:44:53.600
And what could they have done?

01:44:53.600 --> 01:44:54.680
Well, they could have died.

01:44:54.680 --> 01:44:58.240
They could have spread out and gotten away from each other.

01:44:58.240 --> 01:45:00.240
They could have formed a nice two-dimensional monolayer,

01:45:00.240 --> 01:45:01.680
the way that cell culture does.

01:45:01.680 --> 01:45:04.280
What they did instead was something quite different.

01:45:04.280 --> 01:45:05.800
Oops.

01:45:06.240 --> 01:45:09.200
What they did instead, after we put them

01:45:09.200 --> 01:45:11.680
in this little depression, all these little skin cells,

01:45:11.680 --> 01:45:16.120
they got together and they formed this round thing

01:45:16.120 --> 01:45:17.960
we call a xenobot.

01:45:17.960 --> 01:45:19.880
It's called a xenobot because Xenopus lavus

01:45:19.880 --> 01:45:20.720
is the name of the frog.

01:45:20.720 --> 01:45:23.520
And we think it's a biorebotics platform, so xenobot.

01:45:23.520 --> 01:45:25.680
What they do is these little guys

01:45:25.680 --> 01:45:30.200
achieve spontaneous motion by using their cilia.

01:45:30.200 --> 01:45:32.280
So frog skin has little hairs, little,

01:45:32.280 --> 01:45:33.720
motile hairs called cilia, which it

01:45:33.760 --> 01:45:36.600
uses to distribute mucus down the side of the animal.

01:45:36.600 --> 01:45:39.360
So instead, what they do is they use it to row against the water.

01:45:39.360 --> 01:45:40.520
So they start to swim.

01:45:40.520 --> 01:45:41.600
So they can go in circles.

01:45:41.600 --> 01:45:46.320
They can patrol back and forth like this.

01:45:46.320 --> 01:45:47.880
They can have these collective behaviors

01:45:47.880 --> 01:45:49.240
where they can go on a long journey

01:45:49.240 --> 01:45:50.760
or they can interact with each other

01:45:50.760 --> 01:45:53.960
or they can sit there doing nothing.

01:45:53.960 --> 01:45:55.880
They have all kinds of behaviors.

01:45:55.880 --> 01:46:00.080
Here's one moving in a maze in water.

01:46:00.080 --> 01:46:01.800
So you'll see what it does as it goes.

01:46:01.840 --> 01:46:04.080
It takes the corner without bumping into anything.

01:46:04.080 --> 01:46:06.680
And then at this point, it spontaneously decides to turn around

01:46:06.680 --> 01:46:07.960
and go back where it came from.

01:46:07.960 --> 01:46:09.000
We are not pacing it.

01:46:09.000 --> 01:46:10.200
We are not controlling it.

01:46:10.200 --> 01:46:12.280
There are no, there's no neurons here.

01:46:12.280 --> 01:46:17.160
This is a piece of skin living its own, its new best life.

01:46:17.160 --> 01:46:21.400
And you're watching some of its behaviors.

01:46:21.400 --> 01:46:26.560
It has all kinds of active calcium signaling.

01:46:26.560 --> 01:46:30.360
This is the same technology used to read out brain signaling.

01:46:30.440 --> 01:46:32.800
We are currently in the process of trying to decode all this

01:46:32.800 --> 01:46:34.720
to see what the cells are saying to each other.

01:46:34.720 --> 01:46:36.720
What are these two, what if anything

01:46:36.720 --> 01:46:38.920
are these two Xenobots saying to each other?

01:46:38.920 --> 01:46:40.120
They can regenerate.

01:46:40.120 --> 01:46:42.720
So if you cut them almost in half, they will seal up.

01:46:42.720 --> 01:46:43.560
So look at this.

01:46:43.560 --> 01:46:45.680
So here's like 180 degree hinge right there.

01:46:45.680 --> 01:46:48.720
Look at the power it takes to fold itself back

01:46:48.720 --> 01:46:51.040
into its new Xenobot shape.

01:46:51.040 --> 01:46:53.640
And something else that's amazing is by modeling.

01:46:53.640 --> 01:46:57.320
And so Josh Bongard and Sam Kriegman in his lab

01:46:57.320 --> 01:46:58.960
did a bunch of computational modeling

01:46:59.000 --> 01:47:01.520
in the simulator of these bots running around.

01:47:01.520 --> 01:47:04.280
And they noticed a kind of unusual predicted behavior

01:47:04.280 --> 01:47:07.240
that they tend to rearrange their environment

01:47:07.240 --> 01:47:08.080
in this weird way.

01:47:08.080 --> 01:47:10.560
So they went, so we went ahead and we built some of the ones.

01:47:10.560 --> 01:47:13.400
Then again, Doug sculpted some of these things

01:47:13.400 --> 01:47:15.320
in ways that the AI suggested.

01:47:15.320 --> 01:47:17.800
And we discovered something remarkable,

01:47:17.800 --> 01:47:19.960
which is called kinematic replication.

01:47:21.360 --> 01:47:24.480
Notice that we've made it impossible for these animals

01:47:24.480 --> 01:47:26.760
to reproduce in the normal froggy fashion.

01:47:26.760 --> 01:47:27.920
They don't have any other things there.

01:47:27.920 --> 01:47:29.080
They're just skin.

01:47:29.080 --> 01:47:31.880
But within a couple of days,

01:47:31.880 --> 01:47:35.920
they discover a novel way of making copies of themselves

01:47:35.920 --> 01:47:37.560
that's basically Von Neumann's dream.

01:47:37.560 --> 01:47:40.480
It's able to construct copies of itself

01:47:40.480 --> 01:47:42.680
from material it finds in the environment.

01:47:42.680 --> 01:47:45.680
So this white stuff here, these are all loose skin cells

01:47:45.680 --> 01:47:47.800
that we sprinkled into their world.

01:47:47.800 --> 01:47:49.120
What they do is they run around

01:47:49.120 --> 01:47:52.240
and they both collectively and individually,

01:47:52.240 --> 01:47:54.480
they collect them into little balls

01:47:54.480 --> 01:47:56.440
and then they sort of polish these little balls

01:47:56.440 --> 01:47:57.800
and compact them.

01:47:57.800 --> 01:48:00.840
And because they're not working with a passive,

01:48:00.840 --> 01:48:02.560
some kind of passive particle,

01:48:02.560 --> 01:48:04.920
they're working with an agential material,

01:48:04.920 --> 01:48:07.160
just like we were the engineers,

01:48:07.160 --> 01:48:09.400
Doug Blackison was working with an agential material,

01:48:09.400 --> 01:48:10.880
these cells that have an agenda,

01:48:10.880 --> 01:48:13.160
they like to assemble into the xenobot.

01:48:13.160 --> 01:48:17.200
These little blobs become the next generation of xenobots.

01:48:17.200 --> 01:48:18.040
And guess what they do?

01:48:18.040 --> 01:48:19.360
They run around and collect more cells

01:48:19.360 --> 01:48:23.240
and they become the next generation of xenobots and so on.

01:48:23.240 --> 01:48:26.640
And so this ability to make copies of itself

01:48:26.640 --> 01:48:28.760
using kinematic replication is just one of them.

01:48:28.760 --> 01:48:31.480
We're just scratching the surface here of what they can do.

01:48:31.480 --> 01:48:34.040
There is much, much more coming.

01:48:34.040 --> 01:48:39.040
And so this suggests an interesting set of questions.

01:48:40.040 --> 01:48:45.040
What did the frog genome actually learn during evolution?

01:48:45.200 --> 01:48:46.680
Well, it can make frogs, sure,

01:48:46.680 --> 01:48:48.880
and this is the normal tadpole path,

01:48:48.880 --> 01:48:49.920
but it turns out,

01:48:49.920 --> 01:48:51.480
and something we would have never known

01:48:51.480 --> 01:48:53.840
if we hadn't tried this experiment,

01:48:53.840 --> 01:48:55.280
it actually can do other things.

01:48:55.280 --> 01:48:57.400
It can make the exact same genome.

01:48:57.400 --> 01:48:59.240
We didn't edit the genome here.

01:48:59.240 --> 01:49:01.480
We didn't give them any weird new nanomaterials.

01:49:02.560 --> 01:49:05.840
The same genome can have a different developmental path.

01:49:05.840 --> 01:49:07.880
This is what an old xenobot looks like.

01:49:07.880 --> 01:49:11.680
I mean, it has this weird structure

01:49:11.680 --> 01:49:13.400
that who knows what it's changing into.

01:49:13.400 --> 01:49:14.920
And then it has different behaviors

01:49:14.920 --> 01:49:17.600
that's different from what tadpoles do.

01:49:17.600 --> 01:49:19.360
So here's some interesting things about it.

01:49:19.360 --> 01:49:22.400
First of all, for any other creature,

01:49:22.400 --> 01:49:25.560
when you ask why does it look the way it looks?

01:49:25.560 --> 01:49:28.360
Why does it have certain behaviors and properties?

01:49:28.360 --> 01:49:30.160
The answer is always the same, well, evolution.

01:49:30.160 --> 01:49:31.240
So selection, right?

01:49:31.240 --> 01:49:36.240
So for eons, the system was shaped,

01:49:38.320 --> 01:49:40.360
it was selected for specific behaviors,

01:49:40.360 --> 01:49:42.320
everything else died out and there you go.

01:49:42.320 --> 01:49:45.000
But here, you can't use that story here

01:49:45.000 --> 01:49:46.720
because there's never been any xenobots.

01:49:46.720 --> 01:49:49.280
There has never been any selection to be a good xenobot.

01:49:49.280 --> 01:49:53.040
Where did these capacities come from?

01:49:53.040 --> 01:49:56.760
Where did their ability to do kinematic self-replication,

01:49:56.760 --> 01:49:57.600
which to our knowledge,

01:49:57.600 --> 01:49:59.240
doesn't exist anywhere in the biosphere,

01:49:59.240 --> 01:50:00.640
where did that come from?

01:50:00.640 --> 01:50:04.040
Now, we don't know what their cognitive capacities are.

01:50:04.040 --> 01:50:05.040
We're studying that right now.

01:50:05.040 --> 01:50:05.880
What can they sense?

01:50:05.880 --> 01:50:06.720
Do they have preferences?

01:50:06.720 --> 01:50:07.920
How can they learn?

01:50:07.920 --> 01:50:10.280
We don't know any of that yet.

01:50:10.280 --> 01:50:12.200
But we do know that they have novel morphologies

01:50:12.200 --> 01:50:14.440
and novel behaviors and so where does that come from?

01:50:14.440 --> 01:50:16.920
So one way to think about this

01:50:16.920 --> 01:50:20.880
and that same genome by being probed in this way

01:50:20.880 --> 01:50:22.720
is showing us a bit of the latent space,

01:50:22.720 --> 01:50:24.320
a bit of what they are capable of.

01:50:24.320 --> 01:50:26.400
So this is kind of, you know, Jeremy Gay,

01:50:26.400 --> 01:50:27.840
who's an amazing graphic designer

01:50:27.840 --> 01:50:29.400
that does a lot of our artwork,

01:50:29.400 --> 01:50:32.880
did this homage to the famous Hofstadter book,

01:50:32.880 --> 01:50:33.920
Gerd Lescher Bach,

01:50:34.840 --> 01:50:39.840
where he was pointing out that how you look at certain objects

01:50:42.760 --> 01:50:44.800
reveals what you see and what they can do.

01:50:44.800 --> 01:50:46.640
And so through that frog genome,

01:50:46.680 --> 01:50:48.640
when you look through it in a particular way,

01:50:48.640 --> 01:50:50.840
yes, you can see the tadpoles

01:50:50.840 --> 01:50:52.000
and yes, you can see xenobots

01:50:52.000 --> 01:50:53.880
and maybe you can see other things.

01:50:53.880 --> 01:50:56.160
And so what we can say here

01:50:56.160 --> 01:51:00.480
is that these kind of synthetic organisms

01:51:00.480 --> 01:51:01.880
are really a tool.

01:51:01.880 --> 01:51:04.120
They're almost like a periscope or a telescope

01:51:04.120 --> 01:51:06.880
that lets you look into another space

01:51:06.880 --> 01:51:09.760
that we normally don't see into the space of possibilities

01:51:09.760 --> 01:51:11.720
or for example, anatomical structure.

01:51:11.720 --> 01:51:12.920
And so for the last couple of minutes,

01:51:12.920 --> 01:51:14.040
I just wanna talk about this

01:51:14.040 --> 01:51:17.920
and the future of all this in bioengineering and so on.

01:51:17.920 --> 01:51:20.320
And the concepts that we wanna talk about are these.

01:51:20.320 --> 01:51:22.160
We've already talked about multiscale

01:51:22.160 --> 01:51:23.560
competency architecture.

01:51:23.560 --> 01:51:24.960
This idea of polycomputing,

01:51:24.960 --> 01:51:28.720
which Josh Bongard and I came up with to indicate

01:51:28.720 --> 01:51:30.760
the fact that any physical process

01:51:30.760 --> 01:51:32.560
can be treated as a computation,

01:51:32.560 --> 01:51:34.680
as a different computation by different observers,

01:51:34.680 --> 01:51:36.680
depending on how they interpret it.

01:51:36.680 --> 01:51:40.280
And that these observers ourselves observing each other

01:51:40.280 --> 01:51:43.480
and various conspecifics and parasites and so on,

01:51:44.560 --> 01:51:47.200
this idea that really because of this competency,

01:51:47.200 --> 01:51:50.400
because cells and tissues are not a passive material,

01:51:50.400 --> 01:51:54.360
every part is able to hack all the other parts

01:51:54.360 --> 01:51:57.480
by providing signals that exploit their functionality.

01:51:57.480 --> 01:51:59.000
Just like we as engineers,

01:51:59.000 --> 01:52:00.840
and that whole middle part of the talk,

01:52:00.840 --> 01:52:02.360
I was trying to show you that

01:52:02.360 --> 01:52:06.240
triggering complex organ formation and so on,

01:52:06.240 --> 01:52:10.280
you don't have to try to micromanage the molecular steps.

01:52:10.280 --> 01:52:12.660
If you can communicate with a larger system

01:52:12.660 --> 01:52:14.060
to tell it what you want it to do,

01:52:14.060 --> 01:52:15.340
you can take advantage of that.

01:52:15.340 --> 01:52:18.860
Well, biology, we're late to that party as engineers,

01:52:18.860 --> 01:52:21.020
and biology has been doing this all along.

01:52:21.020 --> 01:52:23.260
So I wanna show you a couple of examples.

01:52:23.260 --> 01:52:25.740
The first thing I wanna just mention is,

01:52:25.740 --> 01:52:28.660
building with a gentile materials is very different.

01:52:28.660 --> 01:52:30.380
So when you build with a passive material,

01:52:30.380 --> 01:52:31.700
like making Legos,

01:52:31.700 --> 01:52:34.500
it's on you to put every Lego where it goes.

01:52:34.500 --> 01:52:35.980
All they do is hold shape.

01:52:35.980 --> 01:52:37.540
They have very little competencies

01:52:37.540 --> 01:52:38.660
besides holding their shape.

01:52:38.660 --> 01:52:39.940
So you have to control everything.

01:52:39.940 --> 01:52:41.540
This is molecular medicine.

01:52:41.540 --> 01:52:44.420
This is synthetic biology now.

01:52:44.420 --> 01:52:45.580
This is bioengineering.

01:52:45.580 --> 01:52:47.820
You build everything yourself.

01:52:47.820 --> 01:52:49.780
But so if you wanted to make a tower out of Legos,

01:52:49.780 --> 01:52:51.740
you have to put everything where it goes.

01:52:51.740 --> 01:52:52.580
It's easy.

01:52:52.580 --> 01:52:53.380
There are a few surprises,

01:52:53.380 --> 01:52:56.280
but the problem is if it falls down, that's it.

01:52:56.280 --> 01:52:59.340
You could try to make a tower out of dogs, for example.

01:52:59.340 --> 01:53:00.260
If you made a tower out of,

01:53:00.260 --> 01:53:01.500
if you tried it the old fashioned way

01:53:01.500 --> 01:53:04.220
by stacking dogs on top of each other, that doesn't work.

01:53:04.220 --> 01:53:05.820
The dogs have their own agendas.

01:53:05.820 --> 01:53:07.860
They're gonna walk off, not gonna work.

01:53:07.860 --> 01:53:09.740
But there's a new set of tools

01:53:10.740 --> 01:53:13.860
basically from different parts of this spectrum

01:53:13.860 --> 01:53:14.700
that we talked about,

01:53:14.700 --> 01:53:17.780
different ways of interacting with systems.

01:53:17.780 --> 01:53:20.140
If you don't insist on treating them as this kind of system,

01:53:20.140 --> 01:53:22.340
but you're open to the idea that your material

01:53:22.340 --> 01:53:24.380
might actually be this kind of system.

01:53:24.380 --> 01:53:26.020
And in the case of dogs, it's very obvious.

01:53:26.020 --> 01:53:28.380
In the case of cells, it's only now becoming apparent

01:53:28.380 --> 01:53:31.900
that they are also somewhere here.

01:53:31.900 --> 01:53:33.500
What you can do is train the dogs.

01:53:33.500 --> 01:53:34.820
It's a very different strategy.

01:53:34.820 --> 01:53:36.900
You're now doing behavior shaping

01:53:36.900 --> 01:53:38.600
as opposed to old school engineering.

01:53:38.600 --> 01:53:41.360
But the good news is that this tower repairs itself

01:53:41.360 --> 01:53:43.720
when you knock it down, they'll get right back up.

01:53:43.720 --> 01:53:46.200
And so the question about this competency is,

01:53:46.200 --> 01:53:48.280
what can you expect the subunits to do

01:53:48.280 --> 01:53:50.000
when you're not there to manage them?

01:53:50.000 --> 01:53:51.960
And how do you construct complex things

01:53:51.960 --> 01:53:53.600
out of units like that?

01:53:53.600 --> 01:53:57.000
And the way you do it is by using their natural interface,

01:53:57.000 --> 01:53:59.280
in this case, learning rewards and punishments

01:53:59.280 --> 01:54:00.800
to control their behavior.

01:54:00.800 --> 01:54:01.880
This is hacking.

01:54:01.880 --> 01:54:04.360
Hacking not in the sense of the people

01:54:04.360 --> 01:54:05.640
who steal your credit card numbers,

01:54:05.640 --> 01:54:08.000
but in the sense of using a system

01:54:08.000 --> 01:54:11.720
in not necessarily the way that it was intended to be used,

01:54:11.720 --> 01:54:13.640
but in some clever way that exploits

01:54:13.640 --> 01:54:17.960
the system's own properties for a complex outcome.

01:54:17.960 --> 01:54:20.120
So we see this all the time in behavioral science, right?

01:54:20.120 --> 01:54:22.080
So there are these crazy parasites,

01:54:22.080 --> 01:54:26.040
this toxoplasma that causes animals and humans

01:54:26.040 --> 01:54:27.960
to become less risk averse.

01:54:27.960 --> 01:54:29.400
So captains of industry and people

01:54:29.400 --> 01:54:31.760
who die on motorcycle accidents going too fast

01:54:31.760 --> 01:54:33.520
tend to be infected with this stuff

01:54:33.560 --> 01:54:38.560
because it actually changes your risk aversion level.

01:54:38.720 --> 01:54:42.640
And we've got a fungus that controls ant behavior

01:54:42.640 --> 01:54:43.480
and so on.

01:54:43.480 --> 01:54:47.000
So we know that creatures hack each other's behavioral policies

01:54:47.000 --> 01:54:49.440
for navigating three-dimensional space,

01:54:49.440 --> 01:54:50.280
but that's not all.

01:54:50.280 --> 01:54:52.600
What we're now starting to understand

01:54:52.600 --> 01:54:55.760
is that they're really interesting hacks

01:54:55.760 --> 01:54:59.080
that happen in anatomical and physiological spaces.

01:54:59.080 --> 01:55:02.160
In order to do that, the material, right?

01:55:02.160 --> 01:55:03.280
It's a gentle matter.

01:55:03.280 --> 01:55:06.520
The material on which evolution works,

01:55:06.520 --> 01:55:10.240
so cells and tissues, has to have these various competencies.

01:55:10.240 --> 01:55:11.160
It has to have memories.

01:55:11.160 --> 01:55:13.640
It has to be able to measure things to take in inputs.

01:55:13.640 --> 01:55:16.920
You can't hack something that doesn't have any of that,

01:55:16.920 --> 01:55:17.920
but life does.

01:55:17.920 --> 01:55:19.280
And I wanna show you a couple of examples

01:55:19.280 --> 01:55:21.240
of this plasticity.

01:55:21.240 --> 01:55:24.000
So here is, and this is not Photoshop,

01:55:24.000 --> 01:55:27.160
this is, these are real animals.

01:55:27.160 --> 01:55:30.400
These are flies and on their wings,

01:55:30.400 --> 01:55:32.720
they are running a kind of stripped down

01:55:32.720 --> 01:55:34.320
ant morphogenetic program,

01:55:34.320 --> 01:55:36.640
like a two-dimensional ant morphogenetic program.

01:55:36.640 --> 01:55:38.680
And the reason they do it is because when they flap their

01:55:38.680 --> 01:55:40.000
wings in a particular pattern,

01:55:40.000 --> 01:55:41.360
it looks like ants scurrying around

01:55:41.360 --> 01:55:43.280
and their predators don't wanna deal with the ants

01:55:43.280 --> 01:55:45.040
and they scare them off.

01:55:45.040 --> 01:55:48.120
So it's kind of amazing that on their wings,

01:55:48.120 --> 01:55:51.640
they're able to have these very specific patterns,

01:55:51.640 --> 01:55:53.400
but it's no more amazing than the fly itself.

01:55:53.400 --> 01:55:56.000
I mean, this is just a simplified version

01:55:56.000 --> 01:55:57.720
of what the fly itself is doing,

01:55:57.720 --> 01:55:59.000
but it's in computer sciences,

01:55:59.000 --> 01:56:00.280
would be kind of virtualization.

01:56:00.280 --> 01:56:02.680
The fact that the same tissue can actually make

01:56:02.680 --> 01:56:05.000
different kinds of patterns.

01:56:05.000 --> 01:56:07.080
Now, I wanna show you one of my favorite examples

01:56:07.080 --> 01:56:09.400
of that kind of hacking.

01:56:09.400 --> 01:56:11.240
This is the traditional thing that happens.

01:56:11.240 --> 01:56:14.040
So here's an acorn and we know that what acorns,

01:56:14.040 --> 01:56:17.280
acorn genomes know how to do is make acorn,

01:56:17.280 --> 01:56:18.880
is make oak leaves.

01:56:18.880 --> 01:56:20.560
So they're green, they're flat,

01:56:20.560 --> 01:56:21.880
they have this particular structure.

01:56:21.880 --> 01:56:24.000
This is what that genome does.

01:56:24.000 --> 01:56:27.040
Turns out that with just a little bit of prompting

01:56:27.080 --> 01:56:30.320
from a wasp, these cells are also able

01:56:30.320 --> 01:56:32.520
to make something like this or like this.

01:56:32.520 --> 01:56:33.520
These are galls.

01:56:33.520 --> 01:56:35.840
These are made by the plant cell

01:56:35.840 --> 01:56:39.280
that is infected by this parasite.

01:56:39.280 --> 01:56:41.480
The parasite is hacking these plant cells

01:56:41.480 --> 01:56:43.680
to get them to build something completely different.

01:56:43.680 --> 01:56:46.160
Would we have any clue that these flat green cells

01:56:46.160 --> 01:56:47.920
are able to build something like this

01:56:47.920 --> 01:56:49.480
if we didn't see this example?

01:56:49.480 --> 01:56:51.680
So this is another one of these cases

01:56:51.680 --> 01:56:55.400
where you need to do perturbation experiments.

01:56:55.400 --> 01:56:57.760
In this case, this is a natural one done by this wasp

01:56:57.760 --> 01:57:01.520
to see the latent space of what the system is competent to,

01:57:01.520 --> 01:57:02.480
what is it capable of?

01:57:02.480 --> 01:57:03.920
What else can these cells do?

01:57:03.920 --> 01:57:05.960
And can you imagine all the things that these plant cells

01:57:05.960 --> 01:57:08.320
could do if they can build this kind of stuff?

01:57:08.320 --> 01:57:12.800
So just to finish up here, to really,

01:57:12.800 --> 01:57:16.040
I think all of this pushes in a particular direction,

01:57:16.040 --> 01:57:17.640
kind of again, going back to the sort of

01:57:17.640 --> 01:57:21.720
philosophical side of things, is this an organism?

01:57:21.720 --> 01:57:23.400
It's got a body and it's got some sort of

01:57:23.400 --> 01:57:27.120
cognitive architecture, this frog, is this an organism?

01:57:27.120 --> 01:57:29.520
We tend to think so because we as humans

01:57:29.520 --> 01:57:33.560
have really tiny little observational slits

01:57:33.560 --> 01:57:35.040
through which we see the world.

01:57:35.040 --> 01:57:38.840
We like things that happen not too slowly

01:57:38.840 --> 01:57:40.200
and not too quickly.

01:57:40.200 --> 01:57:44.040
We only can perceive in a certain range

01:57:44.040 --> 01:57:47.680
and thus we only see the animal right here,

01:57:47.680 --> 01:57:51.440
but we now have tools like the xenobot and others

01:57:51.440 --> 01:57:53.320
that can collapse the bigger picture,

01:57:53.320 --> 01:57:55.360
which we normally are pretty blind to,

01:57:55.360 --> 01:57:57.440
into a scale we can actually appreciate

01:57:57.440 --> 01:58:00.600
because this is not the organism, this is the organism.

01:58:00.600 --> 01:58:05.120
It's the cells plus all of the things that can manipulate

01:58:05.120 --> 01:58:07.400
them to do various interesting things.

01:58:07.400 --> 01:58:09.760
It's also the evolutionary cycle wrapped around it.

01:58:09.760 --> 01:58:11.920
It's complex beings like us engineers,

01:58:11.920 --> 01:58:15.440
simple beings like various microbes and the parasites,

01:58:15.440 --> 01:58:18.320
and of course the low agency aspects

01:58:18.320 --> 01:58:20.200
of the environment like chemicals.

01:58:20.200 --> 01:58:23.360
Why do I say all of this is part of the organism?

01:58:23.360 --> 01:58:25.800
Because if you don't understand all this other stuff,

01:58:25.800 --> 01:58:27.080
you really do not understand

01:58:27.080 --> 01:58:28.760
what else these cells are capable of.

01:58:28.760 --> 01:58:31.080
This manifestation is the default.

01:58:31.080 --> 01:58:32.760
It is the most common thing,

01:58:32.760 --> 01:58:36.360
but we are completely blind to all of what it's capable of.

01:58:36.360 --> 01:58:39.520
If we do not understand the other inputs into the system,

01:58:39.520 --> 01:58:41.360
and this is somebody else had mentioned

01:58:41.360 --> 01:58:43.200
that the environment and the context,

01:58:43.200 --> 01:58:44.520
I mean, they're not always there.

01:58:44.520 --> 01:58:48.240
In fact, we need to explore all kinds

01:58:48.960 --> 01:58:50.920
of ones that don't naturally exist

01:58:50.920 --> 01:58:53.920
to really understand what this organism is.

01:58:53.920 --> 01:58:58.480
And so the Xenobot is really a kind of tool

01:58:58.480 --> 01:59:01.480
you can use to peer into other spaces.

01:59:01.480 --> 01:59:03.600
They'll be physiological, the transcriptional.

01:59:03.600 --> 01:59:04.560
I mean, we're studying now

01:59:04.560 --> 01:59:06.280
what the transcriptome of these Xenobots.

01:59:06.280 --> 01:59:09.480
It is not like the transcriptome of frog embryos, by the way.

01:59:10.640 --> 01:59:11.520
This is what it is.

01:59:11.520 --> 01:59:13.480
The environment is full of affordances.

01:59:13.480 --> 01:59:14.800
Some of them low agency,

01:59:14.800 --> 01:59:17.400
some of them rather high agency and everything in between.

01:59:17.400 --> 01:59:21.160
And all of this is part of what actually defines

01:59:21.160 --> 01:59:22.880
what a complex organism is.

01:59:22.880 --> 01:59:25.680
So having seen all this, just to end here,

01:59:25.680 --> 01:59:26.520
having seen all this,

01:59:26.520 --> 01:59:31.280
I will point out that all of the biological natural forms

01:59:31.280 --> 01:59:34.000
that Darwin was impressed by when he said

01:59:34.000 --> 01:59:35.720
endless forms, most beautiful,

01:59:35.720 --> 01:59:39.560
all of that N of one run down the tree of life

01:59:39.560 --> 01:59:42.440
is a tiny region, just a tiny region

01:59:42.440 --> 01:59:45.280
of the state space of all possible beings

01:59:45.280 --> 01:59:46.920
because life is so interoperable

01:59:46.920 --> 01:59:48.200
and so hackable.

01:59:48.200 --> 01:59:50.800
Pretty much every combination of evolved materials,

01:59:50.800 --> 01:59:53.400
so DNA cells and so on, designed material.

01:59:53.400 --> 01:59:56.840
So active matter of various smart appliances and so on.

01:59:56.840 --> 01:59:59.640
And software, any combination of those three things

01:59:59.640 --> 02:00:02.000
is going to be some viable being operating

02:00:02.000 --> 02:00:05.560
in some kind of set of spaces with some cognitive system.

02:00:05.560 --> 02:00:10.120
So cyborgs, hybrids, various kinds of chimeras,

02:00:10.120 --> 02:00:11.600
various kinds of robotics,

02:00:11.600 --> 02:00:13.560
all of these things are somewhere

02:00:13.560 --> 02:00:16.240
in this giant space of possible minds.

02:00:16.280 --> 02:00:18.440
And this has massive implications for us

02:00:18.440 --> 02:00:20.320
on a societal level.

02:00:20.320 --> 02:00:23.840
Because going forward, none of the concepts

02:00:23.840 --> 02:00:26.160
that we grew up with, the sharp distinction

02:00:26.160 --> 02:00:28.800
between humans and non-humans,

02:00:28.800 --> 02:00:30.520
between machines and living beings,

02:00:30.520 --> 02:00:34.640
between intelligence and sort of faking intelligence,

02:00:34.640 --> 02:00:36.800
none of these categories are gonna make it

02:00:36.800 --> 02:00:38.800
through the next couple of decades.

02:00:38.800 --> 02:00:42.000
We need to scrap all of that towards a continuous view

02:00:42.000 --> 02:00:45.000
and a new system of ethics that does not depend

02:00:45.000 --> 02:00:47.200
on the two things that we used to depend on.

02:00:47.200 --> 02:00:49.720
In the olden days, you could ask,

02:00:49.720 --> 02:00:52.080
what are you made of and how did you get here?

02:00:52.080 --> 02:00:54.080
Meaning evolved versus engineered.

02:00:54.080 --> 02:00:55.880
And based on that, you could make a decision

02:00:55.880 --> 02:00:57.560
of how to ethically relate to something,

02:00:57.560 --> 02:00:58.720
you sort of knock on it.

02:00:58.720 --> 02:01:00.200
And if you hear a metallic clangy sound,

02:01:00.200 --> 02:01:02.080
you would say that, ah, you come from a factory,

02:01:02.080 --> 02:01:03.000
you're gonna be pretty boring,

02:01:03.000 --> 02:01:05.000
I can take you apart, whatever.

02:01:05.000 --> 02:01:06.640
None of those things are gonna be good anymore

02:01:06.640 --> 02:01:10.400
because we need to develop novel ways

02:01:10.400 --> 02:01:13.880
to recognize and to relate to beings

02:01:13.880 --> 02:01:16.720
that are nowhere with us on the tree of life.

02:01:16.720 --> 02:01:19.400
They are, we simply cannot judge them that way.

02:01:19.400 --> 02:01:22.000
And this is going to be an exciting

02:01:22.000 --> 02:01:23.800
and grand challenge for the species

02:01:23.800 --> 02:01:28.680
to get beyond a very simplistic view of agency

02:01:28.680 --> 02:01:33.000
towards a more expansive compassion towards other beings

02:01:33.000 --> 02:01:35.800
of radically different composition and provenance.

02:01:35.800 --> 02:01:39.360
So I'll stop here and just say that lots of papers

02:01:39.360 --> 02:01:41.320
that go deeply into all of the things

02:01:41.320 --> 02:01:43.760
that I sort of briefly went over,

02:01:43.760 --> 02:01:47.720
in terms of machines and everything else.

02:01:47.720 --> 02:01:50.280
I'm gonna thank the people who did all the work.

02:01:50.280 --> 02:01:53.280
So these are the postdocs and graduate students

02:01:53.280 --> 02:01:56.160
who did all of the work that I showed you today.

02:01:56.160 --> 02:02:00.320
Many collaborators are various funders,

02:02:00.320 --> 02:02:01.480
the disclosures again.

02:02:02.400 --> 02:02:05.520
Jeremy Gay did all the amazing graphics

02:02:05.520 --> 02:02:07.760
and most of all the animal model systems

02:02:07.760 --> 02:02:09.680
because they do all the heavy lifting

02:02:09.680 --> 02:02:10.840
in teaching us about these things.

02:02:10.840 --> 02:02:14.640
So thank you so much and I will take questions.

02:02:14.640 --> 02:02:15.480
That's wonderful.

02:02:15.480 --> 02:02:18.880
Thank you so much, Michael, for your presentation

02:02:18.880 --> 02:02:20.360
and for your work.

02:02:20.360 --> 02:02:23.160
I mean, the implications are outstanding.

02:02:23.160 --> 02:02:25.840
So thank you so much.

02:02:25.840 --> 02:02:29.120
Given the time, are you okay maybe to take five, 10 minutes?

02:02:29.120 --> 02:02:30.840
Yeah, yeah, sure.

02:02:30.840 --> 02:02:32.400
It's my fault that we went over the two hours.

02:02:32.400 --> 02:02:35.480
So yeah, no, no, no, we all wanted to listen.

02:02:35.480 --> 02:02:37.600
Yeah, if anybody has questions, I'm here.

02:02:37.600 --> 02:02:40.640
Sure, let's go for Richard first.

02:02:40.640 --> 02:02:41.760
Well, thank you very much.

02:02:41.760 --> 02:02:44.160
I'm a non-scientist and a poet.

02:02:45.400 --> 02:02:49.280
And I found this absolutely fascinating in every respect

02:02:50.240 --> 02:02:53.400
and you zipped through it at enormous speeds.

02:02:53.400 --> 02:02:57.640
So I've only been able mentally and hourly

02:02:57.640 --> 02:03:00.000
to take in part of what you've said.

02:03:01.880 --> 02:03:05.840
So I've just got a very simple non-scientific question.

02:03:06.840 --> 02:03:08.680
Right at the end, you said,

02:03:08.680 --> 02:03:11.080
we have, all of this opens up

02:03:14.640 --> 02:03:17.800
our distinctions between what is machine

02:03:17.800 --> 02:03:22.640
and what is biological, what is non-biological,

02:03:22.640 --> 02:03:25.120
et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.

02:03:25.120 --> 02:03:28.680
And you mentioned all of your work

02:03:28.680 --> 02:03:32.840
posits the demand for a new ethics.

02:03:33.960 --> 02:03:36.320
So this is a personal question to you.

02:03:36.560 --> 02:03:39.400
And I raise it because all the way along,

02:03:39.400 --> 02:03:44.400
I've been having all sorts of little ethical quarrels

02:03:44.520 --> 02:03:48.360
with myself, not just with you,

02:03:48.360 --> 02:03:50.560
but with everything that you've said.

02:03:50.560 --> 02:03:53.120
So can I just ask a personal question?

02:03:53.120 --> 02:03:58.120
What are your own personal ethics vis-a-vis the work you're doing

02:04:00.280 --> 02:04:03.320
and vis-a-vis the directions

02:04:03.360 --> 02:04:06.400
in which you see the future happening?

02:04:06.400 --> 02:04:08.280
And what I've got in mind here, of course,

02:04:08.280 --> 02:04:12.000
is that you have spoken about the benefits

02:04:12.000 --> 02:04:14.080
of this kind of work,

02:04:14.080 --> 02:04:19.080
but we all know that scientific advances can be used by,

02:04:19.440 --> 02:04:23.960
let's say, evil people or people who want to use

02:04:23.960 --> 02:04:27.720
and manipulate materials to their own set

02:04:27.720 --> 02:04:30.360
for their old selfish needs.

02:04:30.360 --> 02:04:31.760
So where does that come in?

02:04:31.760 --> 02:04:36.760
And are we in the region of Mary Shelley's Frankenstein?

02:04:40.920 --> 02:04:45.920
Are we in the region of Promethean attacks on the gods?

02:04:52.960 --> 02:04:55.440
There's a few things going on in my head,

02:04:55.440 --> 02:04:58.600
but it really comes down to, I think,

02:04:58.600 --> 02:05:00.480
to ethics and your own views.

02:05:02.760 --> 02:05:05.880
I think that's just enormous admiration

02:05:05.880 --> 02:05:09.360
and thanks for everything that you've given us so far.

02:05:09.360 --> 02:05:10.440
Well, thank you so much.

02:05:10.440 --> 02:05:11.280
I appreciate it.

02:05:11.280 --> 02:05:14.800
I must say I love your background as you can see.

02:05:14.800 --> 02:05:16.360
I have a lot of affinity to that.

02:05:16.360 --> 02:05:18.000
So thank you.

02:05:18.000 --> 02:05:20.360
Let's see, here's what I want to start with

02:05:20.360 --> 02:05:22.320
and I will answer all of that,

02:05:22.320 --> 02:05:24.040
but here's what I want to start with.

02:05:24.040 --> 02:05:27.080
There's a standard kind of view

02:05:27.080 --> 02:05:31.360
that even implicitly underlies a lot of the concern

02:05:31.360 --> 02:05:33.800
when people ask me about these things,

02:05:33.800 --> 02:05:37.560
which is basically this, everything is fine

02:05:37.560 --> 02:05:39.960
and you scientists better not do something

02:05:39.960 --> 02:05:41.560
to really screw it up.

02:05:41.560 --> 02:05:44.280
That is kind of the mainstream assumption.

02:05:44.280 --> 02:05:48.760
And that was sort of understandable back in the day

02:05:48.760 --> 02:05:52.400
when we really could think that things were created

02:05:52.400 --> 02:05:54.960
by someone for us to be the best that they could be

02:05:54.960 --> 02:05:57.200
and really we ought not to screw it up.

02:05:57.200 --> 02:06:01.280
But I think now, I think it's safe to say

02:06:01.280 --> 02:06:03.920
that we have a different vision and this is my vision.

02:06:04.920 --> 02:06:06.840
Things are absolutely not fine.

02:06:06.840 --> 02:06:10.400
And I'm not talking about just the environmental,

02:06:10.400 --> 02:06:13.200
various environmental calamities, but I get,

02:06:13.200 --> 02:06:14.800
and I'm not a clinician,

02:06:14.800 --> 02:06:19.400
but I receive daily phone calls and emails

02:06:19.400 --> 02:06:22.960
from people in the most unbelievable biomedical suffering.

02:06:22.960 --> 02:06:24.800
I mean, my kid has a birth defect.

02:06:24.800 --> 02:06:26.640
I got a tumor, I lost a limb.

02:06:26.640 --> 02:06:28.000
I mean, you can't imagine.

02:06:28.000 --> 02:06:30.280
So people call me every day with this stuff

02:06:30.280 --> 02:06:34.800
and our ability to address that degree of suffering

02:06:34.800 --> 02:06:38.480
and to improve people's opportunity

02:06:38.480 --> 02:06:41.600
to reach their potential given the limitations

02:06:41.600 --> 02:06:44.040
of being born, even in a healthy body, right?

02:06:44.040 --> 02:06:49.040
These limitations, I consider us to be so far off of fine

02:06:51.000 --> 02:06:53.960
that it's, I can't even begin to describe that.

02:06:53.960 --> 02:06:56.440
I think we are not starting here

02:06:56.440 --> 02:06:59.200
and hoping that we don't drop, we are down here.

02:06:59.240 --> 02:07:03.240
And to me, so here's my ethics to get back to your question.

02:07:03.240 --> 02:07:05.480
When people ask me what keeps me up at night

02:07:05.480 --> 02:07:07.360
about all this stuff as an ethical concern,

02:07:07.360 --> 02:07:09.240
here's what keeps me up at night.

02:07:09.240 --> 02:07:14.240
It's the possibility of failure to live up to the promise

02:07:16.880 --> 02:07:18.520
of using this kind of information

02:07:18.520 --> 02:07:21.400
to improve the lived experience for all sentient beings.

02:07:21.400 --> 02:07:22.840
That's literally what it is.

02:07:22.840 --> 02:07:24.840
And I should say, this is not,

02:07:24.840 --> 02:07:27.680
I'm definitely not the only person working on this.

02:07:27.680 --> 02:07:29.720
There are many, many scientists throughout the world

02:07:29.720 --> 02:07:31.280
who have the exact same issue

02:07:31.280 --> 02:07:33.720
who are all working towards the same thing.

02:07:33.720 --> 02:07:36.840
Various degrees of freedom of embodiment

02:07:36.840 --> 02:07:40.280
and regenerative medicine and all of these kinds of things.

02:07:40.280 --> 02:07:44.640
So this is not just, so I don't see it that I myself,

02:07:44.640 --> 02:07:46.640
I'm going to sort of fix all these problems.

02:07:46.640 --> 02:07:49.240
I'm speaking now for my view in the community

02:07:50.400 --> 02:07:55.400
that we have a moral responsibility

02:07:55.440 --> 02:07:59.960
and an absolute kind of imperative

02:07:59.960 --> 02:08:02.800
to use this information to improve the state

02:08:02.800 --> 02:08:04.520
of beings in this world now.

02:08:04.520 --> 02:08:09.520
I do not believe we were sort of both physically in the world

02:08:11.840 --> 02:08:16.200
and in terms of our IQ level,

02:08:16.200 --> 02:08:18.280
our susceptibility to various weird diseases

02:08:18.280 --> 02:08:19.800
to brain degeneration.

02:08:19.800 --> 02:08:21.880
I do not believe that any of this is optimized.

02:08:21.880 --> 02:08:24.200
Evolution did not optimize this for our happiness.

02:08:24.200 --> 02:08:25.800
It did not optimize for intelligence.

02:08:25.800 --> 02:08:27.880
Evolution optimizes for biomass.

02:08:27.880 --> 02:08:28.720
That's it.

02:08:28.720 --> 02:08:31.760
And so it happens to have dropped us at this level,

02:08:31.760 --> 02:08:34.200
which is a little bit of IQ

02:08:34.200 --> 02:08:38.120
and a little bit of survival over seven, eight decades tops.

02:08:38.120 --> 02:08:38.960
And that's it.

02:08:38.960 --> 02:08:41.960
And I don't see this as optimal in any way.

02:08:41.960 --> 02:08:46.960
This is due to the vagaries of the evolutionary process

02:08:46.960 --> 02:08:49.200
and it is now on us, now that we can,

02:08:49.200 --> 02:08:51.520
to make improvements for everybody.

02:08:51.520 --> 02:08:52.680
That's how I see this.

02:08:53.680 --> 02:08:54.680
Thank you very much.

02:08:54.680 --> 02:08:56.680
That's a terrific answer.

02:08:56.680 --> 02:08:57.960
Thank you.

02:08:57.960 --> 02:09:02.400
Tell you on me then, is absolutely crucial to your work.

02:09:02.400 --> 02:09:03.240
Is that right?

02:09:03.240 --> 02:09:08.240
The goal, the view that we are working,

02:09:10.600 --> 02:09:14.720
we are goal-orientated is absolutely crucial then.

02:09:15.600 --> 02:09:16.720
Absolutely.

02:09:16.720 --> 02:09:19.040
And in two ways, let me say this about you.

02:09:19.040 --> 02:09:21.480
So goal-directedness,

02:09:21.600 --> 02:09:24.440
and I'm saying, never mind just us,

02:09:24.440 --> 02:09:26.720
all the way down to you can even,

02:09:26.720 --> 02:09:28.200
with least action, the kinds of things

02:09:28.200 --> 02:09:30.800
you can even talk about particles and simple matter,

02:09:30.800 --> 02:09:33.480
simple matter systems, all the way down.

02:09:33.480 --> 02:09:38.480
And the reason, people who don't like any of it,

02:09:38.960 --> 02:09:41.680
say don't use the word, people who really like teleology

02:09:41.680 --> 02:09:44.280
say use teleology, don't say teleonomy.

02:09:44.280 --> 02:09:46.440
Teleonomy was apparent to the goals, right?

02:09:46.440 --> 02:09:48.320
And it's sort of this hedge that some people use

02:09:48.320 --> 02:09:52.280
to sort of try to avoid being on the bad side

02:09:52.280 --> 02:09:54.680
of the modern paradigm and so on.

02:09:54.680 --> 02:09:57.160
The reason I actually like teleonomy

02:09:57.160 --> 02:09:59.360
is not to go soft on the teleology angle.

02:09:59.360 --> 02:10:00.800
I'm full in.

02:10:00.800 --> 02:10:02.880
The reason what's interesting about teleonomy

02:10:02.880 --> 02:10:07.200
is the fact of apparent means that you're acknowledging

02:10:07.200 --> 02:10:10.480
that there is an observer from whose perspective

02:10:10.480 --> 02:10:11.520
you're describing this.

02:10:11.520 --> 02:10:12.600
And I think that's critical.

02:10:12.600 --> 02:10:14.360
Most of, if we sort of drill down

02:10:14.360 --> 02:10:15.800
into the philosophical underpinnings

02:10:15.800 --> 02:10:17.640
of the things I've been talking about,

02:10:17.640 --> 02:10:20.400
it is very critical that there is not one

02:10:20.400 --> 02:10:23.200
objective right answer to all of this.

02:10:23.200 --> 02:10:24.800
How intelligent is something?

02:10:24.800 --> 02:10:26.840
Well, you're really taking an IQ test yourself

02:10:26.840 --> 02:10:28.360
when you make that claim.

02:10:28.360 --> 02:10:29.400
You might have a human brain

02:10:29.400 --> 02:10:31.000
and you might think it makes a great paperweight

02:10:31.000 --> 02:10:32.280
because you weren't smart enough to know

02:10:32.280 --> 02:10:33.560
what else it knows how to do.

02:10:33.560 --> 02:10:36.880
So all of this from the perspective of some observer

02:10:36.880 --> 02:10:40.560
being that being another cell, a human scientist,

02:10:40.560 --> 02:10:44.280
a conspecific, a parasite who seeks to hack the system

02:10:44.280 --> 02:10:47.040
and engineer, everything is from somebody's perspective.

02:10:47.600 --> 02:10:49.200
So that's why I like teleonomy,

02:10:49.200 --> 02:10:53.560
but I'm 100% into the teleology angle.

02:10:55.040 --> 02:11:00.040
So Gary's points earlier about non-locality

02:11:02.240 --> 02:11:06.160
and the implicit idea that,

02:11:07.920 --> 02:11:11.640
I don't know, could one end up with a Gaia hypothesis?

02:11:11.640 --> 02:11:13.880
Does this relate to a Gaia hypothesis?

02:11:14.080 --> 02:11:16.440
The whole of nature,

02:11:19.000 --> 02:11:22.080
there is a purpose somewhere inherent

02:11:22.080 --> 02:11:23.960
in the whole of nature.

02:11:23.960 --> 02:11:28.960
Well, yes, although I wanna be really clear on this,

02:11:29.600 --> 02:11:30.600
it is not simple.

02:11:30.600 --> 02:11:32.200
I mean, those kind of hypotheses

02:11:32.200 --> 02:11:34.360
are often criticized in the following way.

02:11:35.760 --> 02:11:39.120
Well, you can just add those labels to anything.

02:11:39.120 --> 02:11:40.360
You can sort of look outwards and say,

02:11:40.360 --> 02:11:43.160
there's nature, I'm gonna call it Gaia and here we go.

02:11:43.880 --> 02:11:44.720
So I'm not saying that,

02:11:44.720 --> 02:11:47.040
what I'm saying is that actually,

02:11:47.040 --> 02:11:50.880
I'm insisting that all of those kinds of things

02:11:50.880 --> 02:11:52.960
are actually empirical hypotheses.

02:11:52.960 --> 02:11:55.840
So that means that if you have the Gaia hypothesis,

02:11:55.840 --> 02:11:59.040
what that should do for you is to be able to say

02:11:59.040 --> 02:12:03.520
which tools can you use to benefit

02:12:03.520 --> 02:12:05.680
from the agency you're hypothesizing.

02:12:05.680 --> 02:12:07.600
So for example, if you think that

02:12:08.440 --> 02:12:13.440
some sort of ecosystem is a higher level

02:12:14.760 --> 02:12:17.640
protocognitive agent, you should be able to train it.

02:12:17.640 --> 02:12:20.000
You should be able to find them and decode the memory.

02:12:20.000 --> 02:12:22.440
You should be able to show some tools

02:12:22.440 --> 02:12:24.800
from behavioral science that work at that level.

02:12:24.800 --> 02:12:26.080
And to the extent that you can do that,

02:12:26.080 --> 02:12:28.960
your hypothesis is validated, right?

02:12:28.960 --> 02:12:30.720
All of this, and we do this all the time,

02:12:30.720 --> 02:12:33.680
we apply these kinds of, to me, all of these claims,

02:12:33.680 --> 02:12:35.480
what these claims really are,

02:12:36.320 --> 02:12:38.400
protocols for engineering protocols.

02:12:38.400 --> 02:12:40.080
So if somebody gives me something and says,

02:12:40.080 --> 02:12:42.680
I tell you that the level of intelligence

02:12:42.680 --> 02:12:45.040
in the system is X, what I hear is,

02:12:45.040 --> 02:12:46.800
ah, so here are the things in my toolbox

02:12:46.800 --> 02:12:48.160
that I can use to interact with it.

02:12:48.160 --> 02:12:49.120
That's what you've told me.

02:12:49.120 --> 02:12:50.520
And you might be right and you might be wrong,

02:12:50.520 --> 02:12:52.400
or I might be more or less clever

02:12:52.400 --> 02:12:54.360
and find some better way to interact with it.

02:12:54.360 --> 02:12:55.880
But that's what I hear.

02:12:55.880 --> 02:12:58.400
So the Gaia hypothesis maybe,

02:12:58.400 --> 02:13:01.600
but it is a hypothesis that should be empirically tested

02:13:01.600 --> 02:13:02.840
and somebody should come out and say,

02:13:02.840 --> 02:13:04.760
look, I've done associative conditioning

02:13:04.760 --> 02:13:06.440
on a whole ecosystem, and it works.

02:13:06.440 --> 02:13:08.320
And we've done that on molecular networks, by the way.

02:13:08.320 --> 02:13:12.480
We did that on molecular network models,

02:13:12.480 --> 02:13:15.240
which look very deterministic and very simple and all that.

02:13:15.240 --> 02:13:17.080
Turns out they can do six different kinds of learning.

02:13:17.080 --> 02:13:17.920
Who knew?

02:13:17.920 --> 02:13:20.360
Nobody would have known until you do the experiment.

02:13:21.960 --> 02:13:24.200
And Gaia, shut up, and thank you very much

02:13:24.200 --> 02:13:26.920
because I'm sure lots of other people have got questions.

02:13:26.920 --> 02:13:28.320
Thank you so much.

02:13:28.320 --> 02:13:29.400
Thank you, Richard.

02:13:30.360 --> 02:13:32.520
So yeah, so unfortunately we are towards the,

02:13:32.520 --> 02:13:35.400
we're getting, we've gone quite a bit over.

02:13:35.400 --> 02:13:38.040
However, if after we finish the call,

02:13:38.040 --> 02:13:39.520
I can always leave the room open.

02:13:39.520 --> 02:13:41.240
If, Michael, you're happy to stay

02:13:41.240 --> 02:13:44.640
and answer any questions that there may be.

02:13:44.640 --> 02:13:45.480
Sure, I'll stay.

02:13:45.480 --> 02:13:48.000
Yeah, I'll stay for another 15 minutes.

02:13:48.000 --> 02:13:50.120
I've got till 2.30, so I can, yeah.

02:13:50.120 --> 02:13:51.280
I'll stay for another 15.

02:13:51.280 --> 02:13:52.120
Fantastic.

02:13:52.120 --> 02:13:54.680
Well, just for the purposes of the session,

02:13:54.680 --> 02:13:56.240
we should close.

02:13:56.240 --> 02:14:00.760
But Michael, do you have any final words to leave us with?

02:14:01.760 --> 02:14:03.640
No, I think I've said,

02:14:03.640 --> 02:14:05.920
I've drawn on a lot long enough.

02:14:05.920 --> 02:14:07.320
So thank you, everybody.

02:14:07.320 --> 02:14:09.440
Great questions, great discussion.

02:14:09.440 --> 02:14:11.080
I really appreciate your listening.

02:14:11.080 --> 02:14:11.920
No, thank you.

02:14:11.920 --> 02:14:13.760
Well, thank you so much, Michael.

02:14:13.760 --> 02:14:16.440
Your work has been, as I said, outstanding.

02:14:16.440 --> 02:14:19.560
So I hope we show all the best of luck with your research.

02:14:19.560 --> 02:14:20.520
And that...

02:14:20.520 --> 02:14:21.280
Thank you so much.

02:14:21.280 --> 02:14:22.120
Yeah.

02:14:22.120 --> 02:14:22.960
Thank you.

02:14:22.960 --> 02:14:25.680
And yeah, of course, thank everyone who joined us today.

02:14:25.680 --> 02:14:28.240
Before we go, just a quick reminder that tomorrow

02:14:28.240 --> 02:14:30.080
we will have Dr. Julian Mossbridge

02:14:30.080 --> 02:14:33.120
talking about human thinking and human being

02:14:33.120 --> 02:14:35.800
as part of this series.

02:14:35.800 --> 02:14:37.760
But until tomorrow, if you do have any questions,

02:14:37.760 --> 02:14:43.240
feel free to drop us an email at elinoratbarcenter.com.

02:14:43.240 --> 02:14:44.360
And thank you again, everyone.

02:14:44.360 --> 02:14:45.280
Thank you, Michael.

02:14:45.280 --> 02:14:47.640
As I said, I will leave the call open.

02:14:47.640 --> 02:14:50.200
I'll pass it over to you, Michael, as a host

02:14:50.200 --> 02:14:52.200
to carry on for whoever would like to.

02:14:52.200 --> 02:14:56.600
But thank you again, everyone, from here at the Bar Centre.

02:14:56.600 --> 02:14:57.440
Thank you.

02:15:00.720 --> 02:15:03.280
Yeah, so I think we can...

02:15:03.280 --> 02:15:05.920
Yeah, everyone would like to jump in.

02:15:05.920 --> 02:15:08.080
Yeah, that's fine.

02:15:08.080 --> 02:15:12.520
Michael, thank you for that stunning presentation.

02:15:12.520 --> 02:15:15.680
It's a very general question I'd like to ask.

02:15:15.680 --> 02:15:18.640
And it's really to do with evolution.

02:15:18.640 --> 02:15:23.760
I'm aware of many very credible scientists

02:15:23.760 --> 02:15:27.680
who believe that there are other mechanisms involved

02:15:27.680 --> 02:15:32.360
in evolution, some form of intelligence

02:15:32.360 --> 02:15:37.200
or maybe a mechanism that results in good choices being made.

02:15:37.200 --> 02:15:40.600
I can think of one quantum physicist that actually says

02:15:40.600 --> 02:15:43.120
that, well, consciousness chooses.

02:15:43.120 --> 02:15:46.840
Given the astonishing things you've discovered,

02:15:46.840 --> 02:15:51.360
what is your intuition about evolution

02:15:51.360 --> 02:15:54.800
and whether or not it could possibly be or it is

02:15:54.800 --> 02:15:58.840
random mutations giving some kind of advantage?

02:15:59.840 --> 02:16:01.680
Yeah, well, a couple of things.

02:16:01.680 --> 02:16:06.360
First, the very best person to talk about this with

02:16:06.360 --> 02:16:09.320
is a guy named Richard Watson in the UK.

02:16:09.320 --> 02:16:13.000
And he has what I think is hands down

02:16:13.000 --> 02:16:17.160
the biggest advance in evolutionary thinking.

02:16:17.160 --> 02:16:18.360
And I don't know how long.

02:16:18.360 --> 02:16:22.000
So you guys might want to invite him to speak.

02:16:22.040 --> 02:16:25.080
But here's what I do know.

02:16:27.280 --> 02:16:32.280
Given the various things we've observed our systems doing,

02:16:34.360 --> 02:16:36.600
it would not be very hard to build

02:16:36.600 --> 02:16:41.600
a synthetic biology system in which edited its genome

02:16:43.160 --> 02:16:46.000
with some degree of conscious intent.

02:16:46.000 --> 02:16:47.760
Okay, that would not be difficult.

02:16:47.760 --> 02:16:52.240
Therefore, given that I sort of go with this idea

02:16:52.240 --> 02:16:54.720
that whatever is not physically impossible

02:16:54.720 --> 02:16:57.200
is probably doable somewhere,

02:16:57.200 --> 02:17:00.000
I would find it not surprising at all

02:17:00.000 --> 02:17:00.960
that that would be the case

02:17:00.960 --> 02:17:02.880
because I can certainly see how we would construct

02:17:02.880 --> 02:17:03.720
such a thing.

02:17:04.720 --> 02:17:07.920
However, what I don't have is a lot of evidence

02:17:07.920 --> 02:17:09.600
that that in fact is what's happening.

02:17:09.600 --> 02:17:14.080
So my gut feeling is if I had to say gut feeling,

02:17:14.080 --> 02:17:17.640
I do not believe that the standard purely random account

02:17:17.640 --> 02:17:21.360
of evolution is sufficient to explain what we see.

02:17:21.360 --> 02:17:25.720
But I'm not sure there's superb evidence

02:17:25.720 --> 02:17:28.360
to sort of rule it out.

02:17:28.360 --> 02:17:32.080
And I want to be very clear in distinguishing

02:17:32.080 --> 02:17:34.440
because people tend to jump from one to the other.

02:17:34.440 --> 02:17:38.880
One thing is saying that there is a non-random influence

02:17:38.880 --> 02:17:40.480
over the process, right?

02:17:40.480 --> 02:17:42.120
And I think that's not surprise.

02:17:42.120 --> 02:17:43.880
I wouldn't be surprised by that at all.

02:17:43.880 --> 02:17:45.800
It's quite something else to say

02:17:45.800 --> 02:17:48.240
there is a high level benevolent intelligence

02:17:48.240 --> 02:17:49.960
guiding the process tour, right?

02:17:49.960 --> 02:17:51.640
That's a whole other kettle of fish, right?

02:17:51.640 --> 02:17:54.400
And I have zero reason to think that's the case.

02:17:54.400 --> 02:17:59.400
So some level of control mechanism that isn't randomness,

02:17:59.560 --> 02:18:02.360
I'm probably on board with that, but that's it.

02:18:02.360 --> 02:18:04.800
I wouldn't, I don't think we can, I mean, it's not impossible

02:18:04.800 --> 02:18:07.480
but I don't think we can jump from that to anything else.

02:18:07.480 --> 02:18:10.040
So that's, you know, just want to say that.

02:18:10.040 --> 02:18:11.400
Great, thank you.

02:18:11.400 --> 02:18:13.120
That's very clear, thank you.

02:18:13.120 --> 02:18:13.960
Thank you.

02:18:16.800 --> 02:18:17.800
Okay, just.

02:18:21.800 --> 02:18:22.640
Who else?

02:18:22.640 --> 02:18:26.800
I think Niels and Vyans had a hand up.

02:18:30.800 --> 02:18:32.280
Yeah, please, somebody go.

02:18:32.280 --> 02:18:34.400
Does Neil want to go in or I'd be glad to.

02:18:34.400 --> 02:18:35.960
I have sort of a non-sense.

02:18:35.960 --> 02:18:36.800
Ladies first.

02:18:39.320 --> 02:18:40.680
Okay, thanks.

02:18:40.680 --> 02:18:42.480
Listen, I just wanted to know something about

02:18:42.480 --> 02:18:45.280
from one of the very first slides you presented

02:18:45.280 --> 02:18:49.000
of a cell gravitating towards the three petri dishes.

02:18:49.000 --> 02:18:54.000
If there had been a nutrient in the upper petri dish,

02:18:54.040 --> 02:18:56.640
would that migrated up there

02:18:56.640 --> 02:18:59.720
or would it still go on towards the weightier?

02:18:59.720 --> 02:19:01.360
Yeah, great, great question.

02:19:01.360 --> 02:19:04.720
We have started but not finished a book,

02:19:04.720 --> 02:19:09.360
not a book, probably a paper on the psychology of slime mold.

02:19:09.360 --> 02:19:11.960
And all of these kinds of questions

02:19:11.960 --> 02:19:13.560
in terms of what does it prefer?

02:19:13.560 --> 02:19:14.960
How does it make decisions?

02:19:14.960 --> 02:19:18.080
When two things are, you know, sort of great question.

02:19:18.080 --> 02:19:20.440
It depends on the nutrient and it depends, I mean,

02:19:20.440 --> 02:19:23.040
nutrient, if it's hungry, nutrients tend to win.

02:19:23.040 --> 02:19:24.800
So if it's hungry, it will go for the food

02:19:24.800 --> 02:19:26.360
and ignore the mass.

02:19:26.360 --> 02:19:28.040
By the way, those little, I should say,

02:19:28.040 --> 02:19:30.080
those little white discs, they're not petri dishes,

02:19:30.080 --> 02:19:32.160
they're little tiny glass discs.

02:19:32.160 --> 02:19:34.120
Right through a glass, tiny glass.

02:19:34.120 --> 02:19:37.400
Each one of which weighs about 10 milligrams.

02:19:37.400 --> 02:19:40.840
So this thing can sense at a distance of 10 centimeters,

02:19:40.840 --> 02:19:43.760
the difference between 10 milligrams and 30 milligrams.

02:19:43.760 --> 02:19:45.560
It is ridiculously sensitive.

02:19:45.560 --> 02:19:48.160
But nutrients, nutrients will tend to win.

02:19:48.160 --> 02:19:51.720
Yeah, it's just been the most amazing presentation.

02:19:51.720 --> 02:19:52.560
Thank you.

02:19:52.560 --> 02:19:53.400
Thank you so much.

02:19:53.400 --> 02:19:54.240
Thank you.

02:19:54.240 --> 02:19:55.080
Yeah.

02:19:55.080 --> 02:19:55.920
Niels.

02:19:57.400 --> 02:20:02.400
Yes, amazing, a lot of stuff and little bits floating

02:20:04.640 --> 02:20:07.760
around here and there and all over the place.

02:20:08.760 --> 02:20:11.000
That was very interesting.

02:20:11.880 --> 02:20:16.880
In my case, I've been a computer chap for over 50 years

02:20:21.880 --> 02:20:26.320
and I've managed to do what I now can see

02:20:26.320 --> 02:20:28.080
quite remarkable things.

02:20:28.080 --> 02:20:33.080
And so I spent some time trying to keep up with you

02:20:33.920 --> 02:20:37.800
because I immediately started thinking about all the things

02:20:37.800 --> 02:20:42.080
that I could implant into this.

02:20:42.080 --> 02:20:45.920
And so it's really,

02:20:48.920 --> 02:20:53.520
you've heard about P equal NP complete, I'm sure.

02:20:53.520 --> 02:20:54.360
Yeah.

02:20:55.360 --> 02:20:58.560
What difference would that make, do you think?

02:20:59.560 --> 02:21:04.560
To find, because that would basically be able to hold

02:21:05.920 --> 02:21:10.920
everything together in all its complexity.

02:21:11.600 --> 02:21:15.600
And so I have some experience with that for

02:21:16.560 --> 02:21:20.560
in terms of transportation modeling and pedestrian

02:21:20.560 --> 02:21:23.560
and all these interactions and things.

02:21:23.560 --> 02:21:27.560
So I was thinking, I'm not sure if I'm going to be able

02:21:27.560 --> 02:21:32.560
to get involved in there and try and simulate it

02:21:32.560 --> 02:21:37.560
in a deterministic way, not in a stochastic way.

02:21:39.560 --> 02:21:41.560
Yeah, drop me an email.

02:21:41.560 --> 02:21:44.560
I mean, this is, we do about a third of my group.

02:21:44.560 --> 02:21:46.560
My background is computer science as well.

02:21:46.560 --> 02:21:51.560
And about a third of my group is computational

02:21:51.560 --> 02:21:53.560
and the others are bench biologists.

02:21:53.560 --> 02:21:56.560
So we do a ton of modeling and simulation of this stuff.

02:21:57.560 --> 02:21:59.560
So just drop me an email and we could talk

02:21:59.560 --> 02:22:01.560
about what can be done.

02:22:01.560 --> 02:22:03.560
Yes, I would love to do that.

02:22:03.560 --> 02:22:04.560
Great, great.

02:22:04.560 --> 02:22:05.560
Yeah.

02:22:05.560 --> 02:22:06.560
Okay, thank you.

02:22:06.560 --> 02:22:07.560
It was a great talk.

02:22:07.560 --> 02:22:08.560
Thank you so much.

02:22:08.560 --> 02:22:10.560
Lots of information in that.

02:22:10.560 --> 02:22:11.560
Thank you.

02:22:11.560 --> 02:22:12.560
Thank you.

02:22:13.560 --> 02:22:14.560
Phillip.

02:22:15.560 --> 02:22:16.560
Hello.

02:22:16.560 --> 02:22:17.560
Hi.

02:22:17.560 --> 02:22:21.560
I'd like to take you back to the body of the planaria worm.

02:22:21.560 --> 02:22:23.560
And we're talking about the heads and the two heads.

02:22:23.560 --> 02:22:27.560
And in order for the body to form,

02:22:27.560 --> 02:22:31.560
apparently there's a bioelectric distribution that.

02:22:33.560 --> 02:22:35.560
Allows us to happen.

02:22:35.560 --> 02:22:38.560
And I'm wondering what you think of the source of that distribution

02:22:38.560 --> 02:22:41.560
within the biomass of the body is.

02:22:41.560 --> 02:22:43.560
Yeah.

02:22:43.560 --> 02:22:46.560
Are you asking physically which cells it's in?

02:22:46.560 --> 02:22:48.560
Are you asking where it came from?

02:22:48.560 --> 02:22:50.560
I'm asking where it came from.

02:22:50.560 --> 02:22:51.560
Right.

02:22:51.560 --> 02:22:54.560
Well, that's, that's a great, that's a great question.

02:22:54.560 --> 02:22:57.560
So let's, um, the, the best way to think about,

02:22:57.560 --> 02:22:58.560
and we're still,

02:22:58.560 --> 02:23:00.560
we're still groping for the right metaphors to understand it,

02:23:00.560 --> 02:23:03.560
but let's, let me, let me give you what, what I have so far.

02:23:03.560 --> 02:23:04.560
Um,

02:23:04.560 --> 02:23:08.560
The thing with asking where things came from is, is this, and I think,

02:23:08.560 --> 02:23:10.560
you know, maybe, maybe some of the, um,

02:23:10.560 --> 02:23:13.560
non science people on the call will like this more than,

02:23:13.560 --> 02:23:15.560
more than the science people, but, but, but here you go.

02:23:15.560 --> 02:23:17.560
Um, imagine a, um,

02:23:17.560 --> 02:23:19.560
um, uh, imagine a Galton board.

02:23:19.560 --> 02:23:22.560
If you haven't seen one of these things, you can buy a toy of it on Amazon.

02:23:22.560 --> 02:23:23.560
It's 15 bucks.

02:23:23.560 --> 02:23:26.560
It's a wooden board like this and you bang a bunch of nails into it vertically,

02:23:26.560 --> 02:23:29.560
you know, vertically, and you take a bucket and you take a bucket of marbles

02:23:29.560 --> 02:23:31.560
and you dump it over and the marbles go boom, boom, boom, boom, boom,

02:23:31.560 --> 02:23:32.560
and they land on the bottom.

02:23:32.560 --> 02:23:35.560
They always land in the same pattern, this beautiful bell curve, right?

02:23:35.560 --> 02:23:37.560
They always make this beautiful bell curve.

02:23:37.560 --> 02:23:40.560
So you can ask this question of, um,

02:23:40.560 --> 02:23:42.560
where's the bell curve encoded?

02:23:42.560 --> 02:23:45.560
So you look at the wood and you don't really see it there and you look at the nails.

02:23:45.560 --> 02:23:48.560
You don't really see it there and you look at the distribution of nails and

02:23:48.560 --> 02:23:49.560
I really see it there.

02:23:49.560 --> 02:23:53.560
What you find out, and this is, you know, uh, uh, mathematicians,

02:23:53.560 --> 02:23:56.560
like, like, uh, Pythagoras and Plato have been saying this for, for,

02:23:56.560 --> 02:23:57.560
for a long time.

02:23:57.560 --> 02:24:00.560
What you find out is that when you build certain kinds of machines,

02:24:00.560 --> 02:24:04.560
you are actually harnessing patterns that exist.

02:24:04.560 --> 02:24:08.560
I don't know where, you know, Plato thought there was a separate world for them,

02:24:08.560 --> 02:24:12.560
but, but, but this is, you know, so, so for example, when you make a couple of

02:24:12.560 --> 02:24:15.560
transistors, meaning ion channels, when you, ion channels are transistors,

02:24:15.560 --> 02:24:17.560
they're voltage gated current conductances.

02:24:17.560 --> 02:24:20.560
When, when evolution discovers a couple of ion channels,

02:24:20.560 --> 02:24:23.560
it can make logic gates which come with truth tables.

02:24:23.560 --> 02:24:25.560
Evolution doesn't have to discover truth tables there.

02:24:25.560 --> 02:24:26.560
You get that for free, right?

02:24:26.560 --> 02:24:29.560
And the fact that the NAND gate is, you know, uh,

02:24:29.560 --> 02:24:32.560
it has these special properties, you get that, you get all of that for free.

02:24:32.560 --> 02:24:33.560
It's a free gift from somewhere.

02:24:33.560 --> 02:24:34.560
We don't know where it is.

02:24:34.560 --> 02:24:37.560
So what we have here is something similar.

02:24:37.560 --> 02:24:42.560
What evolution did is find a set of ion channels that are expressed

02:24:42.560 --> 02:24:46.560
in a standard planarian that by default, when you turn on the juice,

02:24:46.560 --> 02:24:52.560
what that system does is stable is, is, is, is find and stabilize in an

02:24:52.560 --> 02:24:56.560
attractor in the state space of the, of the electrical circuit that corresponds

02:24:56.560 --> 02:24:57.560
to one head.

02:24:57.560 --> 02:25:00.560
By default, still, you know, reliably, that's what it does.

02:25:00.560 --> 02:25:04.560
When you, when we, when we've learned to perturb it, which took, you know,

02:25:04.560 --> 02:25:08.560
10 years to learn to do that, you can push it into a different state and

02:25:08.560 --> 02:25:09.560
it'll do that.

02:25:09.560 --> 02:25:11.560
But the question is where did it come from?

02:25:11.560 --> 02:25:14.560
It's sort of like asking, uh, you know,

02:25:14.560 --> 02:25:17.560
if I give you a collection of parts for a calculator and you turn it on,

02:25:17.560 --> 02:25:21.560
and it says zero by default on a little LCD, where did that come from?

02:25:21.560 --> 02:25:26.560
And it's, it's the result of the laws of physics of computation and some

02:25:26.560 --> 02:25:29.560
other stuff working out through the physical machine.

02:25:29.560 --> 02:25:33.560
And this, all this sounds very airy, fairy and, and sort of, um, uh,

02:25:33.560 --> 02:25:35.560
philosophical, but, but, but here's a practical part.

02:25:35.560 --> 02:25:40.560
Imagine that your evolution and you, in your world, the most fit thing is a

02:25:40.560 --> 02:25:42.560
triangle of a particular type.

02:25:42.560 --> 02:25:45.560
So, so, so you're sorting through this population and eventually you find the

02:25:45.560 --> 02:25:49.560
first angle and then you do some more, you know, every generations go by and

02:25:49.560 --> 02:25:51.560
you eventually find the second angle.

02:25:51.560 --> 02:25:52.560
And now you're done.

02:25:52.560 --> 02:25:54.560
You don't need to go looking for the third angle.

02:25:54.560 --> 02:25:56.560
You know what the third angle is because, because they add up to 180.

02:25:56.560 --> 02:25:58.560
How did you, how did you, if your evolution,

02:25:58.560 --> 02:26:02.560
how did you save two thirds of the effort in, in evolving this thing?

02:26:02.560 --> 02:26:05.560
Where did this magical fact that you know what the third angle is?

02:26:05.560 --> 02:26:06.560
Where did that come from?

02:26:06.560 --> 02:26:11.560
So, so we get here to the point where, um, asking where things come from is tricky.

02:26:11.560 --> 02:26:17.560
We can, we can do the biophysics of that, of, of showing what the space looks

02:26:17.560 --> 02:26:22.560
like and why the system lands in particular regions of that space.

02:26:23.560 --> 02:26:27.560
But it's not super easy to figure out, to ask, it's like, where's the

02:26:27.560 --> 02:26:28.560
distribution of primes come?

02:26:28.560 --> 02:26:29.560
Where's that encoded?

02:26:29.560 --> 02:26:32.560
You know, all the physical facts of the, of the universe could be different

02:26:32.560 --> 02:26:34.560
and the distribution of primes would still be what it is.

02:26:34.560 --> 02:26:39.560
So I think we're, we're literally bumping up against that old question of

02:26:39.560 --> 02:26:43.560
where the truths of mathematics live.

02:26:43.560 --> 02:26:45.560
Okay, I'll just say one final thing.

02:26:45.560 --> 02:26:46.560
Thank you for the answer.

02:26:46.560 --> 02:26:54.560
But what perplexes me very much is how the two headed version comes to be so

02:26:54.560 --> 02:27:01.560
quickly, you know, another, another stable configuration emerges.

02:27:01.560 --> 02:27:06.560
It's, it's, it's very perplexing to me that I agree that it's perplexing.

02:27:06.560 --> 02:27:10.560
And, and I think the, you know, when I first started to understand the,

02:27:10.560 --> 02:27:14.560
when I first saw that Xenobot running around and it suddenly like hit me

02:27:14.560 --> 02:27:18.560
in the head, there's never been any Xenobots like evolution has zero

02:27:18.560 --> 02:27:20.560
explanatory power here.

02:27:20.560 --> 02:27:26.560
I, I, it suddenly dawned on me that what, what, what, what Plato would say to

02:27:26.560 --> 02:27:31.560
this is that the two headed planarian and the Xenobot have always been there.

02:27:31.560 --> 02:27:35.560
They're part of this latent space that we had never had access to.

02:27:35.560 --> 02:27:39.560
And we finally built a physical machine that enables us to see that part of

02:27:39.560 --> 02:27:40.560
the space.

02:27:40.560 --> 02:27:41.560
I think that's what that's what he would say.

02:27:41.560 --> 02:27:46.560
I think that something existed in the past that laid down a certain behavior

02:27:46.560 --> 02:27:48.560
pattern that they're tuning into.

02:27:48.560 --> 02:27:50.560
I don't, I don't think they're creating those patterns.

02:27:50.560 --> 02:27:54.560
I think they're finding patterns that already existed.

02:27:54.560 --> 02:27:57.560
Yeah, I mean, I said, I, right, I think you and I are on the same page here.

02:27:57.560 --> 02:28:02.560
The patterns exist, but I think we have to be, you know, the traditional,

02:28:02.560 --> 02:28:08.560
the traditional scientific story here would be they, they are patterns that,

02:28:08.560 --> 02:28:12.560
you know, typically in a normal tree of life, what you see is these are patterns

02:28:12.560 --> 02:28:18.560
that either existed in some ancestor and were shaped by evolution to be.

02:28:18.560 --> 02:28:20.560
That's not the case here.

02:28:20.560 --> 02:28:24.560
But I agree with you, the patterns exist independently of what we've done.

02:28:24.560 --> 02:28:27.560
We've just stumbled onto them for the first time and who knows what else is out

02:28:27.560 --> 02:28:28.560
there.

02:28:28.560 --> 02:28:29.560
Okay, very good.

02:28:29.560 --> 02:28:32.560
Thank you.

02:28:32.560 --> 02:28:33.560
Thank you.

02:28:33.560 --> 02:28:34.560
Thank you.

02:28:34.560 --> 02:28:35.560
Thank you.

02:28:35.560 --> 02:28:36.560
Thank you.

02:28:36.560 --> 02:28:37.560
Thank you.

02:28:37.560 --> 02:28:38.560
Thank you.

02:28:38.560 --> 02:28:39.560
Thank you.

02:28:39.560 --> 02:28:42.560
Thank you for burning things. I'm going to have to go in about a minute.

02:28:42.560 --> 02:28:43.560
All right.

02:28:43.560 --> 02:28:46.560
Well, thank you so much, everybody. This has been, this has been really fun.

02:28:46.560 --> 02:28:47.560
Yes.

02:28:47.560 --> 02:28:48.560
Yeah.

02:28:48.560 --> 02:28:51.560
Lots of, lots of great things for me to think about. So, so thank you so much.
