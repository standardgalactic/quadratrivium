00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,280
Hello, everyone, and welcome to the session of Incredible Minds.

2
00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:11,920
I'm James B. Barbieri, program coordinator here at the Paris Center and your host for

3
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:13,000
today.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,120
Any problems, just let me know in the chat and I'll try and help you.

5
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:21,520
Just very briefly, a quick reminder to make sure your microphone is muted.

6
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:25,120
We do encourage you all to turn on your cameras.

7
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:30,640
The chat is open, so feel free to share your thoughts and ideas with the rest of the group

8
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:32,880
throughout this session.

9
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:39,040
And we do have closed captions available if that's how you prefer to view the session.

10
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:42,960
Finding the session is recorded for archival purposes and for you all, you should receive

11
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:46,080
the link in a few days.

12
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:51,920
So today we are honored to be joined by Michael Levin, who received a dual undergraduate

13
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:57,040
degree in computer science and biology, followed by PhD in molecular genetics from Harvard.

14
00:00:57,040 --> 00:01:02,440
He did his postdoc training at Harvard Medical School and started his independent lab in

15
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:03,440
2000.

16
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:08,920
He is currently the Vannevar Bush Chair at the Tufts University, an associate faculty

17
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:11,920
member of the Vice Institute of Harvard.

18
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:17,240
He serves as the founding director of the Allen Discovery Center at Tufts.

19
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:24,320
His lab uses a mix of developmental biophysics, computer science, and behavior science to

20
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:29,560
understand the emergence of mind and unconventional embodiments at all scales, and to develop

21
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:36,040
interventions in regenerative medicine and application in synthetic bioengineering.

22
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:42,000
Today he will be talking to us about the collective intelligence of cells with morphogenesis, while

23
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:47,160
bioelectricity outside the brain means for understanding our multi-scale nature.

24
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:49,480
And with that, I'll pass it over to you, Michael.

25
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:50,480
Welcome.

26
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:51,480
Thank you so much.

27
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:56,240
I really appreciate the opportunity to share some ideas with you and to be part of this

28
00:01:56,240 --> 00:02:00,520
event and some of the other speakers you've had, which were tremendous.

29
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:02,320
So let me see.

30
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:03,320
All right.

31
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:04,480
Can everybody see the slides?

32
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:05,480
Is it good?

33
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:06,480
Okay.

34
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:07,480
Yeah.

35
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:11,520
So if you're interested in this after the fact, you can find at this website here,

36
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:16,320
you can find all of the primary papers, the software, the data sets, everything, everything

37
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:17,320
is here.

38
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:19,160
And you can also get in touch with me here.

39
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:24,560
So today, what I'd like to transmit to you are some examples of the following main points.

40
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:30,080
I'm going to stress this idea that all intelligence is collective intelligence, and in particular,

41
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:36,600
the notion of scaling from the competencies of simple subunits to larger kinds of cognitive

42
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:37,600
systems.

43
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:42,080
We're going to talk about problem-solving in diverse and unconventional problem spaces,

44
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:47,720
and we're going to talk about the navigation of these virtual spaces as intelligence.

45
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:50,400
We'll talk about a kind of goal-directedness.

46
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:54,600
We'll talk about agency and unconventional embodiments.

47
00:02:54,600 --> 00:03:00,360
And towards the end, this idea of universal hacking and of components of biological systems,

48
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:05,040
trying to manipulate the behavior of other systems, both above, below, and lateral to

49
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:06,040
them.

50
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:11,760
I'm going to spend about a third of the talk using anatomical control as an example of

51
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:16,840
a collective intelligence of cells navigating a particular kind of anatomical space.

52
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:21,400
And I'm going to show you lots of data on bioelectric networks as a kind of cognitive

53
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:26,200
glue that is the ancestor of brain function.

54
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:32,240
And we're going to talk about the impact that this is going to have on biomedicine.

55
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:37,920
Towards the end, I'm going to talk about some synthetic bioengineering and ways to think

56
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:44,480
about creating and then relating to novel types of beings, which has lots of implications

57
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:47,240
for science, for engineering, and for ethics.

58
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:51,200
So the talk is going to go in three parts, and what I'll do is, at the end of each part,

59
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:56,400
I'm going to pause, I'll take some questions, we'll take a break, people can get up and

60
00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:00,320
stretch and get water and whatnot, and then we'll continue.

61
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:07,520
So the first part is going to be my efforts to break down some common categories and some

62
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:10,600
terminology that I think is really limiting the field.

63
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:15,480
And so for this reason, we're going to talk about stretching that into a kind of continuum

64
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:19,600
of various types of agents, and I want to show you some examples.

65
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:26,440
So this is, even though this is fairly, fairly a very old view, this is a famous painting

66
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:30,200
of Adam naming the animals in the Garden of Eden.

67
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:34,080
This is still actually quite prevalent in many, many relevant discussions.

68
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:40,520
What you see here is that there's a very sharp binary distinction between Adam here and the

69
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:42,040
rest of the animals.

70
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:47,800
So it's very clear that there are different kinds of creatures, fundamentally different

71
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:48,880
kinds.

72
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:57,920
But what we know now, because of Darwin and because of Von Baer, is that actually this

73
00:04:57,920 --> 00:05:02,600
notion that there's some kind of a sharp binary category of being a human is actually

74
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:09,040
a smooth continuum, both on an evolutionary time scale, where if you slide back in evolutionary

75
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:15,760
time, you see a very gradual set of changes that go from that human all the way back to

76
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:17,880
a microbe and below that.

77
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:23,440
And of course, even on the life scale of the individual itself, you see we all start life

78
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:29,720
as a single cell, and then slowly and gradually we become what is basically considered to

79
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:31,640
be a standard human.

80
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:36,800
So we are at the center of this kind of continuum that stretches in two different timescales,

81
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:42,640
but it's actually even more complex than that, because now with bioengineering and various

82
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:48,800
other technologies, there are additional axes in this space where we can stretch the notion

83
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:50,440
of what a human actually is.

84
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:55,200
And you can imagine slowly adding various prosthetics, various technologies within the

85
00:05:55,200 --> 00:06:01,400
body as is already happening, people who can control wheelchairs with their minds via implants

86
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:02,400
and things like this.

87
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:08,800
And of course, biological modifications that we can make both genetic and non-genetic.

88
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:13,720
And so we see here that and at every level of organization, cell tissue organism and

89
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:22,240
so on, we can replace native naturally evolved materials with all sorts of novel, either

90
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:24,760
natural or engineered materials.

91
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:32,560
And so we start to see that this notion of a standard human can be quite continuous in

92
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:34,240
a number of different dimensions.

93
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:40,360
And so I've been trying to develop a framework called TAME, and we'll talk about this more.

94
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:43,680
TAME stands for technological approach to mind everywhere.

95
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:51,880
And the idea is to be able to recognize, create, and relate to truly diverse intelligences,

96
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:58,040
not just the familiar creatures like us and maybe birds and dolphins and things, but also

97
00:06:58,040 --> 00:07:03,520
really unusual creatures like colonial organisms and swarms and synthetic life forms that might

98
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:11,280
be engineered, software artificial intelligences, possible alien life if that's found.

99
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:17,240
So all of these things ought to be able to be handled by a mature science of diverse

100
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:18,400
intelligence.

101
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:23,400
And they have to be dealt with the same set of concepts regardless of what they're made

102
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:29,120
of, so regardless of their composition or origin story, meaning evolved versus engineered

103
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:30,720
or anything in between.

104
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:33,840
And of course, I'm not the first person to try for something like this.

105
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:38,480
So Rosenbluth, Wiener, and Bigelow did something like this.

106
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:43,520
In the 40s where they gave us this ladder, where you can see that all the way from basically

107
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:49,400
passive matter, all the way up through complex human metacognitive types of capacities, there

108
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:52,520
are a set of great transitions.

109
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:55,640
But nevertheless, these things are all on the same spectrum.

110
00:07:55,640 --> 00:08:02,680
The idea was that we should be able to understand how various types of material implementations

111
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:07,000
can begin to have these kinds of functionalities.

112
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:15,120
And so one of the essential ways of thinking about these things in my framework has to do

113
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:17,560
with the relation of an observer.

114
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:21,760
And that observer might be an engineer, it might be another conspecific, it might be some

115
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:27,720
sort of a parasite or in fact, the evolutionary process itself, some sort of observer that

116
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:31,320
is able to modulate what the system is doing.

117
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:36,440
And so you can think about different ways of modulating a system depending on how sophisticated

118
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:37,440
it is.

119
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:40,800
So down here on this end of the spectrum, the only way you're going to make changes is

120
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:43,600
by engineering directly at the hardware level.

121
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:47,440
You're not going to convince a clock of anything, you're not going to reward and punish it.

122
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:49,760
All there is is mechanical engineering.

123
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:54,280
But you can cybernetics take this to things like this, these thermostats which have recorded

124
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:55,280
set points.

125
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:59,880
And so there you can do some interesting things such as modify the set point without rewiring

126
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:04,320
the hardware and get the system to take on a novel set of goals without having to rewire

127
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:05,320
it.

128
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:09,160
And then of course, more complex systems, availous of an interface involving rewards

129
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:14,200
and punishments and various other behavior shaping techniques where you can rely on the

130
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:16,560
system to learn from experience.

131
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:20,960
And then of course, we have even more, even more complex beings which are able to follow

132
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:22,320
logic and so on.

133
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:27,280
And so the difference in all of these different systems is not what they're made of or how

134
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:32,440
they got here, but it's what are the set of tools and techniques that you might use to

135
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:36,800
relate to that system all the way from physical rewiring to something that looks a lot more

136
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:42,040
like a psychoanalysis where you're literally trying to affect the model that the system

137
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:44,920
has of itself, of the outside world and so on.

138
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:52,400
So this shows you the kind of inclusive framework we're trying to make.

139
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:57,200
And the interesting thing is that all of us made this amazing journey across the Cartesian

140
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:58,200
cut.

141
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:04,000
We were all ones, so-called just physics, physics and chemistry, a little blob of protoplasm

142
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,360
and an unfertilized oocyte, quiescent.

143
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:12,280
And then through the process of embryonic development, we became one of these functional

144
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:15,560
creatures or even something like this.

145
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:24,960
And the crucial thing about this process of self-construction is that there is no magical

146
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:30,800
sort of sharp red line at which point you go from being just physics to being a true

147
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:32,120
cognitive being.

148
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:36,840
So many people would like to look at themselves and say, we have true, you name it, sentience,

149
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:40,240
cognition, intelligence, whatever term you want.

150
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:44,560
And then they would look at something like this, which is a little blob of chemicals.

151
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:47,040
And they say, well, that certainly doesn't have any of those things.

152
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:51,280
And so then you owe a story of how you got from here to there.

153
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:56,360
And that story cannot be any kind of a sharp change.

154
00:10:56,360 --> 00:11:02,160
It has to be a gradual process that is in concert with what we know about embryonic development

155
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:03,660
and so on.

156
00:11:03,660 --> 00:11:04,660
So that's interesting.

157
00:11:04,660 --> 00:11:09,120
So we go from matter to mind in this way that I think developmental biology is maybe the

158
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:11,680
most magical of the sciences.

159
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:14,960
But at least we tend to think of ourselves, once we get here, we tend to think of ourselves

160
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:19,240
as some sort of a unified intelligence.

161
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:24,160
And in fact, we often, people will contrast the kinds of thing that we are with something

162
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:29,760
like ant colonies or bee swarms or something like that and say, well, we talk about that

163
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:32,640
as a collective intelligence, but that's a metaphor.

164
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:36,520
We are a true intelligence, collective intelligence is something else.

165
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:39,680
But actually, this is not the case.

166
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:43,880
And so Descartes, for example, was really interested in the pineal gland because he said that the

167
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:50,000
pineal gland was unique, it was an unpaired organ in the brain and therefore a kind of

168
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:54,480
a singular unified location for the mind to interact with the body.

169
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:58,160
But if he had had access to good microscopy, what he would have discovered is that there

170
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:00,360
isn't one of anything in the brain.

171
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:04,120
In fact, inside the pineal gland, you see this, which is a huge number of individual

172
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:05,440
cells.

173
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:09,680
If he had had this technology, he could have looked inside of any one of those cells and

174
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:14,040
discovered that they, in fact, are made of a huge number of different components and

175
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:15,440
various kinds of active matter.

176
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:21,520
So there are mitochondria, there are little motors that zip up and down various filaments,

177
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:23,760
just an incredible number of parts.

178
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:27,360
And so all of us are collective intelligences.

179
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:33,240
I'm not aware of any intelligence that is really just some sort of one indivisible diamond

180
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:34,560
of mind.

181
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:37,040
We are all made of parts of different kinds.

182
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:39,600
And so this is the sort of thing we're made of.

183
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:42,400
This is a single cell, it's called the lacrimaria.

184
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:45,640
This is a unicellular organism.

185
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:48,840
It has no brain, it has no nervous system, no stem cells.

186
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:57,120
It has remarkable competencies over its physiological, metabolic, and anatomical goals.

187
00:12:57,120 --> 00:13:02,920
So you can see here that it's basically, this is at hunting in its environment.

188
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:06,800
If you're into soft-body robotics, this is an amazing design challenge.

189
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:10,760
We don't have anything remotely this competent.

190
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:13,800
And cells have all kinds of other interesting capabilities.

191
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:17,560
So this is the sort of thing that's studied in the field of diverse intelligence or basal

192
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:18,560
cognition.

193
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:20,680
I'll show you another example.

194
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:22,600
This is a slime mold.

195
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:26,560
So this slime mold, this is a unicellular slime mold called physarum polycephalum.

196
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:29,120
And we've put a little bit of it here on this petri dish.

197
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:31,240
We put one glass disc up here.

198
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:33,080
We put three glass discs back here.

199
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:34,080
They're just glass.

200
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:35,080
They're completely inert.

201
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:36,080
They're very thin.

202
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:38,880
They have no food or any kind of a chemical substance on them.

203
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:43,880
But what happens is that this, and by the way, this slime mold, it's a single cell.

204
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:46,200
It can be very large, but the whole thing is a single cell.

205
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:50,840
So what it starts to do is it starts to grow out, basically in every direction at once.

206
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:56,000
But during this time, during these 600 minutes or so, what it's actually doing as we discovered

207
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:00,600
is gently tugging on the material around it and reading the strain angle that comes

208
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:01,600
back.

209
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:07,120
And based on that strain angle, it builds up towards a decision of where the heavier

210
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:08,280
mass is.

211
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:11,720
And the way we know this is because reliably what it's going to do is grow towards the

212
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:12,960
heavier mass.

213
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:17,520
And so by reading that strain angle, it's able to gain some knowledge of its environment.

214
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:22,360
And then for some reason that we don't know, it prefers moving towards the heavier masses.

215
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:28,800
And so we see that we have this biological material that's very sort of ancient and early

216
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:32,160
in life has interesting capabilities.

217
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:37,040
And then the real question becomes, how do these things scale up?

218
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:41,480
What is it that allows combinations of these cells to do something like this?

219
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:44,760
So this is a very standard scenario.

220
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:50,920
The rat learns to press the lever to get the reward, and that's sort of very well understood.

221
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:56,600
But the interesting thing is that the rat is really a collection of cells, and no individual

222
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:59,000
cell has both experiences.

223
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:02,720
So there are cells on the foot of the rat that interact with the lever.

224
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:08,440
There are cells in the intestine that collect the nutritious reward sometime later.

225
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:13,000
But no individual cell has the experience of doing this and receiving that.

226
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:18,360
And so who is it that owns this kind of associative memory between two events that no individual

227
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:19,360
cell experienced?

228
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:24,160
So clearly, you need some sort of a, and the standard answer, of course, is the nervous

229
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:29,720
system provides this, you need some sort of way to integrate individual cellular activities

230
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:31,720
towards a single being.

231
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:33,600
Now this is kind of very common.

232
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:39,560
I want to show you some uncommon examples that people don't hear about a lot to kind

233
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:42,600
of stretch our idea of what's possible.

234
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:49,160
So this is a caterpillar, a soft-bodied kind of creature that crawls around and eats leaves,

235
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:51,320
and it has a certain kind of brain.

236
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:55,320
Remarkably, it transforms itself into a completely different kind of creature that now lives

237
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:56,680
in a three-dimensional world.

238
00:15:56,680 --> 00:16:00,040
It flies, and it doesn't like leaves anymore.

239
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:01,040
It wants nectar.

240
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:05,000
And so a very different set of behaviors, very different set of preferences, very different

241
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,760
brain.

242
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:10,640
The brain is actually largely dissolved during this metamorphosis process.

243
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:14,600
The most of the synapses are broken, maybe most of the cells are killed, and a new brain

244
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:15,920
is reassembled.

245
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:22,560
But there's actually really good evidence that the memories that you impart onto the

246
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:27,560
caterpillar that you train, the moth or butterfly will actually retain those memories, and there's

247
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:31,840
work on this in beetles and various other creatures.

248
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:33,720
So you can think about two things.

249
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:38,960
The practical issue of, isn't it amazing to have a memory medium that can basically be

250
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:44,320
taken apart and put back together and drastically rearranged and still retain its information

251
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:45,320
content?

252
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:50,480
Anything like that in computer science or anything like that.

253
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:54,360
And of course, it raises some philosophical, interesting philosophical questions, which

254
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:59,200
is, never mind the older question of what's it like to be a butterfly, the question could

255
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:04,120
be posed, what's it like to be a caterpillar slowly changing into a butterfly?

256
00:17:04,120 --> 00:17:08,040
Because this is a change that happens not on an evolutionary time scale, but actually

257
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:10,880
during the lifetime of an active individual.

258
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:18,600
And so this ability to retain memory through very drastic deformations is really maximized

259
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:21,640
by this other system known as planarian flatworms.

260
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:23,880
We'll talk much more about that.

261
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:30,520
And these planarian flatworms, they can be trained, and if you train them, for example,

262
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:36,920
to recognize these little bumpy patterns as the place where they get fed, what you can

263
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:42,400
then do is amputate their head, which contains their brain.

264
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:46,840
You are left with a tail, the tail sits there doing nothing for about eight days.

265
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:53,080
It slowly regrows a brand new head and McConnell, who discovered this in the 60s and got a lot

266
00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:57,720
of flak for it was actually completely correct in that these new animals with a brand new

267
00:17:57,720 --> 00:18:01,200
brain still remember that original information.

268
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:06,480
And so what we have here is first evidence that information is not stored exclusively

269
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:10,760
in their centralized brain, but actually apparently spread throughout the body.

270
00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:18,160
And you see this ability of those tissues to imprint that information onto the new brain

271
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:19,160
as it develops.

272
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:23,200
So this idea of information actually moving through body tissue.

273
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:27,160
And so you can think about, you know, there's this malfunctioning transporter experiment

274
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:30,560
from philosophy 101 where they say, well, there's this transporter.

275
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:34,680
And so what it does is you step into it and it destroys the original body and recreates

276
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:36,760
a molecule for molecule copy somewhere else.

277
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:40,600
And so now you've you've transported, but what if it malfunctions and it doesn't erase

278
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:41,600
the original copy?

279
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:42,600
How many of you are there?

280
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:47,080
Well, in Plenaria, you can literally do that because you can cut them into into pieces,

281
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:51,080
many pieces, and each piece becomes a perfect little little worm.

282
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:57,080
So so so we start to see that that, you know, kind of the common workhorses of behavioral

283
00:18:57,080 --> 00:19:01,480
science and cognitive neuroscience or rats and things like this are just the tip of the

284
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:02,480
iceberg.

285
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:07,280
And there are many interesting phenomena that speak to this question of what are cells,

286
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:13,320
what are integrated beings, what what's information, how does it move through the body invertebrates.

287
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:15,600
You see this kind of interesting plasticity.

288
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:19,240
So this is a tappel of the frog, Xenopus labus.

289
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:22,520
And here are the nostrils, here's the brain, here's the gut.

290
00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:24,600
And what you'll notice is that there aren't any eyes.

291
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:26,600
We prevented these eyes from forming.

292
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:31,000
But what we did do is graft a an eye primordium onto the tail.

293
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:34,280
And so these cells actually make a perfectly good eye.

294
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:37,920
And not only do they make an eye, but they make an optic nerve that optic nerve comes

295
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:41,640
out and you can see what it's doing here, it's it doesn't go to the brain, it stops

296
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:44,080
here at synapses onto the spinal cord.

297
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:48,960
And we made this machine that automates the training and testing of these animals and

298
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:50,840
visual cues.

299
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:55,920
So what so what we find is that they can see they can see quite well actually, and despite

300
00:19:55,920 --> 00:20:00,960
the fact that they have a radically different sensory motor architecture, it does not require

301
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:03,680
evolutionary adaptation time.

302
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:09,360
This happens immediately in one in one lifetime of a single tappel, and they can do perfectly

303
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:13,880
well with a completely different kind of connection between their sense organs and their brain.

304
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:20,200
And this this kind of thing has massive implications for evolution, too, because some, for example,

305
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:25,040
a mutation that causes their their eye to be to be pushed off doesn't immediately get

306
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:30,560
weeded out because the animals can't see and die, but rather these animals, the behavior

307
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:31,480
is quite robust.

308
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:35,880
And so the evolution is free to explore any other consequence of that same mutation.

309
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:42,400
It really buffers this this competency really buffers the negative consequences of of mutations.

310
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:49,000
So what we see the reason the reason that all of this plasticity works is that biology

311
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:54,440
is built on this kind of multi scale competency architecture where all the way from molecular

312
00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:58,400
networks, cellular networks of tissues and organs and so on.

313
00:20:59,040 --> 00:21:04,920
Every level here is not merely a structural set of nested dolls, but is actually a functional

314
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:05,880
problem solver.

315
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:09,120
In other words, they are competent, they have competencies in specific spaces.

316
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:12,720
This might be the space of gene expression or transcriptional space.

317
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:14,720
This might be physiological space.

318
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:17,680
This might be familiar three dimensional behavioral space and so on.

319
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:23,040
And so each of these levels solves various problems at various degrees of sophistication.

320
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:30,000
And so what I'd like to do is really expand from from this notion that behavior takes

321
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:36,880
place in three dimensional space and and and understand that that to biology, all kinds

322
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:42,920
of other spaces that we are not good at perceiving and thinking about those are equally valid

323
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:44,280
problem spaces.

324
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:50,280
So we this this this familiar space of behavior, we are very good at recognizing

325
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:56,600
intelligence when medium sized beings moving at medium speeds through three dimensional

326
00:21:56,600 --> 00:21:59,560
space are doing clever things and we and we recognize that right away.

327
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:03,640
But there are these other spaces that we are not good at, for example, gene expression

328
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:05,080
space and physiological space.

329
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:11,200
I think that if we had a built in kind of innate ability to feel our blood chemistry,

330
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:16,360
for example, if we had sensors sensors pointing inwards, not just not just outwards, I think

331
00:22:16,360 --> 00:22:20,840
we would have no trouble recognizing our liver and our kidneys as intelligent beings

332
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:25,120
navigating physiological problem space and solving various problems, the way that we

333
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:26,800
recognize other animals doing it.

334
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:32,440
And so I'm going to spend the most of the time in the next section talking about this

335
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:34,720
problem solving in this anatomical morphospace.

336
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:39,520
But I just want to show you one interesting example of a different kind of space called

337
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:40,640
physiological space.

338
00:22:41,080 --> 00:22:44,800
So here's here's an experiment we we showed a couple of years ago.

339
00:22:45,080 --> 00:22:46,360
So so here's a flatworm.

340
00:22:46,360 --> 00:22:49,360
You put these flatworms in a solution of barium.

341
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:52,920
Now, barium is a nonspecific potassium channel blocker.

342
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:56,880
So what it does is it blocks the ability of the cells to swap potassium in and out.

343
00:22:57,960 --> 00:23:02,000
The cells are very unhappy, especially the cells in the head, because all these neurons

344
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:06,280
like to flow potassium in order to keep their physiology correct.

345
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:10,600
And so what happens is their heads explode literally overnight, their heads, their heads

346
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:11,600
degenerate.

347
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:15,040
But the amazing thing is that if you leave them in barium within a couple of weeks,

348
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:18,800
they grow back a new head and the new head doesn't care about barium at all.

349
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:20,600
No problem. It's barium adapted.

350
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:22,640
So we asked we asked a simple question.

351
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:24,880
What is different transcriptionally?

352
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:28,880
What genes do these barium adapted heads express that the standard heads do not

353
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:31,920
express? And what we found out is that there's very small number on the order of

354
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:36,880
about a dozen genes that are that are changed here to go to become barium adapted.

355
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:39,200
Now, here's the here's the kicker to all of this.

356
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:41,960
Plenaria never see barium in the wild.

357
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:47,280
This barium doesn't exist in nature in the way that the way that we used it here.

358
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:51,240
And so there's never been evolutionary pressure for Plenaria to know what to do

359
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:54,080
when they've been exposed to this incredible stressor.

360
00:23:54,520 --> 00:23:59,520
So when you think about how they found these few

361
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:03,120
correct genes out of a sea of tens of thousands of other genes,

362
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:08,160
it's a little bit like I visualize it like sitting in a in a nuclear reactor

363
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:10,320
control room and things melting down.

364
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:13,480
So you have this this very strong physiological stressor,

365
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:16,400
which you don't have time to do is to start randomly flipping buttons.

366
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:19,000
And so because not not only because there's no time for that,

367
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:22,720
it's the combinations are astronomical, but also because

368
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:26,520
because many of the things you do this way are going to kill the cell

369
00:24:26,520 --> 00:24:31,440
along before you find the the barium adaptation region of that space.

370
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:37,200
So so it's so it's a surge of a roughly 20,000 dimensional space

371
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:41,000
to find a new region of that space that solves your problem.

372
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:44,480
This is this is absolutely a kind of navigating problem solving

373
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:46,720
that we really do not understand how this works.

374
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:48,520
But this is an example of what I mean.

375
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:53,160
And I think that what evolution does is pivot some of the same

376
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:56,360
mechanisms and some of the same tricks and the same problem

377
00:24:56,600 --> 00:25:00,640
problems, problem solving strategies through various spaces,

378
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:04,040
including very early life, I have to solve metabolic problems

379
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:07,400
and then and then some physiological problems and then gene expression

380
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:09,280
and then anatomical morphous space.

381
00:25:09,280 --> 00:25:13,200
And of course, 3D behavioral space once brains and muscles showed up

382
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:16,520
and then linguistic space and who knows who knows what else.

383
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:22,800
So what evolution does is is is is pivot organisms through these various spaces.

384
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:25,320
And of course, even the distinction between these spaces

385
00:25:25,320 --> 00:25:28,440
is completely arbitrary relative to us and as an observer.

386
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:30,880
So as, for example, Chris Fields points out,

387
00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:36,080
if you are a bacterium sitting in a in the concentration gradient

388
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:39,840
of some nutrient, you could move in three dimensional space

389
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:44,360
to try to go up up the gradient, or you could move in transcriptional space,

390
00:25:44,560 --> 00:25:47,680
turn on some other gene that would let you instead metabolize

391
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:51,800
some other kind of molecule that's in that space and solve your problem that way.

392
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:55,760
So to the to the bacterium, it will not see a clean separation

393
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:58,000
between three dimensional space and transcriptional space.

394
00:25:58,240 --> 00:25:59,880
All of these things are effectors.

395
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:04,440
All of these things are moves that it can make in its various spaces to solve problems.

396
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:10,760
OK, so let's so let's take a break here before we go on to the next section.

397
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:16,440
And I'll pause and and if anybody has questions, I'm happy to happy to talk about it.

398
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:21,520
Oh, how long would you like this this break to be?

399
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:26,200
Um, let's take let's take maybe five minutes, five minutes.

400
00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:28,040
Yeah, if people have questions, great.

401
00:26:28,040 --> 00:26:30,240
And if not, just take five minutes and get some water.

402
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:34,920
Yeah, if you do have any question, you can use the raise your hand function

403
00:26:34,920 --> 00:26:38,320
or or just come in if if I don't see you.

404
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:41,120
I see that Gary has.

405
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:44,320
He's had a couple of questions there in the chat.

406
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:46,760
I don't know if he wants to come in and ask his questions.

407
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:50,760
Gary, let me unmute. Can you hear me?

408
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:54,320
We can. OK.

409
00:26:55,280 --> 00:27:00,080
Well, first of all, I think your work is just amazing and magnificent.

410
00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:02,440
And it's

411
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:08,320
I just love the idea of a plenarium, you know, regenerating its head.

412
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:11,480
I mean, that that you showed that McConnell was right about what he.

413
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:14,800
So here's the thing.

414
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:19,680
Does what you are seeing suggest the possibility

415
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:26,160
that panpsychism is what is driving the material adaptation,

416
00:27:27,040 --> 00:27:31,720
that there is a fundamental consciousness

417
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:39,040
that, you know, that then drives the adaptation of the of the material elements.

418
00:27:39,560 --> 00:27:42,560
Yeah, so there are no, please keep keep going.

419
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:46,480
No, and the concept of also of semiotic freedom,

420
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:50,600
which Jesper Hoffmeyer has talked about, which is the idea that

421
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:56,200
that evolution favors the capacity to communicate, right?

422
00:27:56,440 --> 00:28:03,240
That that the more sophisticated the communication can be that integrates, right?

423
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:07,680
The species within its body, but also within its

424
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,440
conspecifics, right, within its community,

425
00:28:12,360 --> 00:28:14,640
which might explain why we're here.

426
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:17,280
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, great, great questions.

427
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:18,520
Thank you.

428
00:28:18,520 --> 00:28:22,760
There are to me, there are two different dimensions to this to this question.

429
00:28:23,280 --> 00:28:26,360
One is overall the concept of panpsychism.

430
00:28:26,360 --> 00:28:29,200
And I think what wait, if you would wait till the very end,

431
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:31,560
and we'll talk about this after the third part.

432
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:35,880
But the other interesting part you said is is about the driving of evolution.

433
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:39,960
So so I'll just I'll just say one one one thing about it here,

434
00:28:40,280 --> 00:28:48,080
which is that if you think about the kind of pre Darwinian notion of

435
00:28:48,520 --> 00:28:51,880
what what people call whether they associate this with with Lamarck, most of all,

436
00:28:51,880 --> 00:28:56,880
but this idea that that evolutionary change is not random with respect to outcome

437
00:28:57,040 --> 00:29:01,560
that basically by stretching, you know, his neck, the giraffe has children with longer necks.

438
00:29:01,560 --> 00:29:08,040
OK, the problem with the up until 2018,

439
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:10,480
I would have said that I would have said the following.

440
00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:14,840
The reason that Lamarckism is a strong Lamarckism, of course, of course,

441
00:29:14,840 --> 00:29:19,720
and there's some some mechanisms for for epigenetic inheritance and so on.

442
00:29:19,720 --> 00:29:23,000
But the reason that strong Lamarckism is impossible is has nothing to do

443
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:25,280
with Weissman's barrier or setting aside the germline.

444
00:29:25,280 --> 00:29:26,640
All of that is completely porous.

445
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:29,680
People have shown that that doesn't stop any man that that's that's easy.

446
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:33,400
The hard part and prior to 2018, I would have said impossible

447
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:38,240
is that the real problem is that genes don't encode specific characters.

448
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:39,960
In other words, there's no gene for neck length.

449
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:44,000
And so if you wanted a longer neck, you have to solve this inverse problem

450
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:47,280
of which genes do you mutate to have a longer neck?

451
00:29:47,280 --> 00:29:49,800
It's, you know, it's it's an it's an impossible inverse problem.

452
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:51,360
So I would have said that's impossible.

453
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:55,520
However, looking at this looking at this barium experiment,

454
00:29:55,880 --> 00:29:59,520
what we see here is that the cells have basically done the hardest part.

455
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:04,040
They have identified which which genetic loci are relevant to the new problem

456
00:30:04,040 --> 00:30:04,880
they're facing.

457
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:08,440
Once you've identified which those are mutating them by some kind of crisper

458
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:11,680
type of mechanism or some kind of genomic editing mechanism, that's trivial.

459
00:30:11,680 --> 00:30:15,080
There are lots of lots of organisms to edit their genomes in various ways.

460
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:16,800
Once you know which genes.

461
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:21,040
And so, you know, now I have a slightly different view on it to say that

462
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:25,640
I don't know how they do it, but we do have some evidence that cells can infer

463
00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:29,760
which genes are responsible for specific adaptive outcomes.

464
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:33,160
And if that's the case, I'm no longer sure that it's impossible

465
00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:35,960
that that to some extent they're driving the evolutionary change.

466
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:39,720
Because once you and again, this is a very, of course, this is a very controversial area.

467
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:43,680
I have not, you know, remotely enough evidence yet to prove that that's

468
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:48,080
that that has implications on a on a global evolutionary trajectory scale.

469
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:52,480
But I no longer think it's impossible because we can see cells solving this inverse problem.

470
00:30:53,080 --> 00:30:56,880
I mean, it suggests that there's some form of entanglement, right?

471
00:30:56,880 --> 00:31:01,400
I mean, which is which we know is true in quantum physics.

472
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:06,800
Even though, you know, we don't have a material way of explaining it.

473
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:13,720
That is that the that the problem solving element is not is not necessarily based

474
00:31:13,720 --> 00:31:20,600
on the materiality of the genome adapting, but that there's some kind of

475
00:31:20,600 --> 00:31:26,000
an influence that comes from the functional need to survive, right?

476
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:31,880
To, you know, to to change itself so that it can sustain itself

477
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:35,120
as a living creature in a barium solution.

478
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:37,520
Yeah. Yeah.

479
00:31:37,520 --> 00:31:40,120
I mean, so I haven't shown you anything yet.

480
00:31:40,120 --> 00:31:44,000
There are some things coming that that may relate to this, but I haven't shown you

481
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:48,560
anything yet that suggests that the solution has to be any kind of exorbitant.

482
00:31:48,560 --> 00:31:52,760
But the solution has to be any kind of exotic, you know, physics or anything

483
00:31:52,760 --> 00:31:56,960
like that, right? Because because for now, for the next for the whole next section,

484
00:31:56,960 --> 00:32:02,040
which we should start in a few minutes, what you'll see is that there's a tremendous

485
00:32:02,040 --> 00:32:05,920
amount of intelligent problem solving that can be squeezed out of a perfectly

486
00:32:05,920 --> 00:32:09,000
conventional set of mechanisms, not to say that there aren't others.

487
00:32:09,240 --> 00:32:13,240
But but we haven't yet, I think, come to the point where we need to invoke

488
00:32:13,240 --> 00:32:14,400
anything more, more exotic.

489
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:16,280
But, you know, we'll see.

490
00:32:16,280 --> 00:32:17,680
OK. Thank you.

491
00:32:17,720 --> 00:32:20,880
You, Gary, there are a few more questions, Mike.

492
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:22,360
Are you happy to take them?

493
00:32:22,360 --> 00:32:24,600
Let's yeah, let's do let's do let's say one more.

494
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:27,840
And then and then, you know, at the end, I'll stay as long as people want afterwards.

495
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:30,400
But, you know, let's we'll move on to the second section.

496
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:31,400
Thank you.

497
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:34,520
Beth, do you have a question?

498
00:32:34,520 --> 00:32:35,880
Yes.

499
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:39,360
And like Gary, I want to just say this is this absolutely fascinating.

500
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:42,120
But unlike Gary, I'm not a scientist.

501
00:32:42,120 --> 00:32:44,240
So this is probably naive.

502
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:48,080
I'm trying to bring together an idea from the very first of what you said

503
00:32:48,520 --> 00:32:49,760
and what you said at the end.

504
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:53,480
And that has to do with the scale and the continuum.

505
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:58,800
I'm curious, you know, thinking about human beings or higher critters

506
00:32:59,320 --> 00:33:02,800
that we have an awful lot of diverse things within us.

507
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:07,560
And I'm just curious if we don't have a lot of that

508
00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:12,680
what you call the physical space, the continuum that goes across time,

509
00:33:12,680 --> 00:33:14,800
the evolutionary time.

510
00:33:14,800 --> 00:33:21,000
We must be just a polyglot of different levels of evolutionary development.

511
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:22,480
Is that so?

512
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:26,840
Yes, yes, you've you've anticipated a chunk of the third part of the talk.

513
00:33:26,840 --> 00:33:28,720
Yeah, you stay tuned.

514
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:31,280
That's coming. You are 100 percent on the money there.

515
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:33,560
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, it's coming.

516
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:37,200
OK, so yeah, let me let me move on to the second part.

517
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:40,680
And then we will, well, you know, we can come back to any of this.

518
00:33:40,920 --> 00:33:44,360
So the second the second thing that I want to talk about is to really give you

519
00:33:44,360 --> 00:33:50,480
an example, a very concrete example of a of an unconventional

520
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:53,800
collective intelligence of a of a of a problem solving system

521
00:33:53,800 --> 00:33:57,280
that doesn't look like what we're used to thinking about as intelligent systems.

522
00:33:57,520 --> 00:33:59,080
And what we're going to use for that example

523
00:33:59,080 --> 00:34:03,280
is is the distributed collective intelligence of cells

524
00:34:03,280 --> 00:34:05,040
as they undergo morphogenesis.

525
00:34:05,040 --> 00:34:07,160
And then specifically, we'll talk about bio electricity.

526
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:11,480
So let's I like to start by noticing this interesting thing.

527
00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:14,280
So so Alan Turing obviously needs no introduction,

528
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:17,600
kind of the father of computer science and some other things.

529
00:34:18,080 --> 00:34:21,720
And he was interested in intelligence and intelligence

530
00:34:21,720 --> 00:34:24,920
in novel embodiments that are not natural

531
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:27,560
and computation and things like this.

532
00:34:27,560 --> 00:34:29,840
And so he was interested in problem solving machines,

533
00:34:30,040 --> 00:34:32,560
and in particular, the notion of reprogrammability

534
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:35,720
or intelligence through a kind of plasticity.

535
00:34:36,720 --> 00:34:39,080
Interesting. And so and so he, you know,

536
00:34:39,080 --> 00:34:41,440
he wrote these foundational papers and computer science.

537
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:45,000
But interestingly, he also wrote a paper on this

538
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:47,000
on the chemical basis of morphogenesis.

539
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:51,680
So the question he was addressing is how can biological order

540
00:34:51,720 --> 00:34:56,240
or at least in this case, biochemical order arise spontaneously?

541
00:34:56,440 --> 00:35:00,760
And so you might wonder why would somebody who is interested in computing

542
00:35:00,760 --> 00:35:04,040
and mathematics and machines, machine intelligence,

543
00:35:04,280 --> 00:35:06,960
why would he be thinking about chemical morphogenesis

544
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:08,760
and embryos and things like this?

545
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:11,200
And I think that like with many things,

546
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:12,960
this is just an example of Turing's genius.

547
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:16,640
I think he saw very clearly that these are fundamentally the same problem.

548
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:18,680
And I'm going to argue that that's true,

549
00:35:18,680 --> 00:35:22,520
although he didn't write much, if anything, about this that I know of.

550
00:35:22,520 --> 00:35:26,640
But I think he was onto this idea that the formation of the mind

551
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:29,360
and the formation of the body are fundamentally the same problem.

552
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:32,520
And so let me take you on a little tour of some of that.

553
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:34,440
So let's let's ask this question.

554
00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:38,040
This is a this is a cross section through a human torso.

555
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:42,280
Look at look at the amazing order here, right?

556
00:35:42,280 --> 00:35:46,080
So all the organs, the cells, the tissues, everything is in the right

557
00:35:46,080 --> 00:35:49,720
the right size, the right shape or next to the right thing oriented in the right direction.

558
00:35:50,840 --> 00:35:55,080
And it all comes from a collection of embryonic blastomeres during development.

559
00:35:55,080 --> 00:35:56,360
And it's a self assembly.

560
00:35:56,360 --> 00:35:59,080
Where does this particular pattern come from?

561
00:35:59,320 --> 00:36:03,560
Now, the kind of immediate answer that most people give, well, it's in the DNA.

562
00:36:03,560 --> 00:36:05,040
It's in the genome.

563
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:08,440
And we're going to come back to this with a vengeance in the third part of the talk.

564
00:36:08,440 --> 00:36:13,960
But I want to point out already here that that is kind of an untenable answer

565
00:36:13,960 --> 00:36:18,520
because we can read genomes now and we know what what genomes encode.

566
00:36:18,520 --> 00:36:19,840
They encode proteins.

567
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:22,680
They don't specifically encode three dimensional shapes.

568
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:26,680
They encode the tiny hardware that every cell gets to have.

569
00:36:26,680 --> 00:36:31,080
And so there's still this this this massive question of using that hardware.

570
00:36:31,080 --> 00:36:34,600
How does the physiology of this cellular machine

571
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:38,920
make this particular pattern and not some other pattern?

572
00:36:38,920 --> 00:36:43,400
And the thing is that the structure of the human body is no more directly in the genome

573
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:49,000
than the structure of a termite nest or the shape of a spider web is in the genomes of the

574
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:52,200
of the termites or the spider web.

575
00:36:52,200 --> 00:36:57,960
It's an emergent construction project of the collective intelligence of these cells.

576
00:36:57,960 --> 00:36:59,880
And so we can ask interesting questions.

577
00:36:59,880 --> 00:37:02,920
How do these cells know what to make and when to stop?

578
00:37:02,920 --> 00:37:07,080
And then for the third part of the talk, we'll talk about what else is possible

579
00:37:07,080 --> 00:37:09,880
as an as a regenerative medicine worker.

580
00:37:09,880 --> 00:37:14,760
We'd like to know if a part is damaged or missing, how do we get the cells to rebuild it?

581
00:37:14,760 --> 00:37:18,440
And as an engineer, we'd like to go one step further and say, OK, but can we get these cells

582
00:37:18,440 --> 00:37:21,560
to build something completely different, something that's not like this at all?

583
00:37:21,560 --> 00:37:27,320
And to think about, I like to sort of think all the way forward so that we know where we're going.

584
00:37:27,320 --> 00:37:29,800
Let's think about what is the end game of this field?

585
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:33,800
You know, when can we all basically say we're done and go home?

586
00:37:33,800 --> 00:37:39,400
And the way I envision this is as something called an anatomical compiler.

587
00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:43,160
So just imagine at some point in the future, you're going to be able to sit down in front

588
00:37:43,160 --> 00:37:47,640
of a computer and draw the plant or animal that you want.

589
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:49,560
It could be something that already exists.

590
00:37:49,560 --> 00:37:52,040
It could be some organ that you need for transplantation.

591
00:37:52,040 --> 00:37:55,480
It could be some completely different thing, you know, some sort of a six-legged frog

592
00:37:55,480 --> 00:37:56,840
with a little propeller on its head.

593
00:37:56,840 --> 00:37:57,560
It could be anything.

594
00:37:57,560 --> 00:38:00,120
The point is it could be absolutely anything.

595
00:38:00,120 --> 00:38:03,560
And if we had a mature science of this, if we knew what we were doing,

596
00:38:03,560 --> 00:38:08,760
this anatomical compiler would output a set of stimuli that would have to be given to cells

597
00:38:08,760 --> 00:38:13,000
to get them to build whatever you drew, like in this case, this three-headed flatwork.

598
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:15,480
And so the idea, this is not a 3D printer.

599
00:38:15,480 --> 00:38:21,800
This is not something that meticulously micromanages the position of cells to print what you want.

600
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:23,800
This is a communications device.

601
00:38:23,800 --> 00:38:26,600
What it does is it's a translator, really.

602
00:38:26,600 --> 00:38:32,360
It translates from your anatomical goals to the anatomical goals of a collection of cells,

603
00:38:32,360 --> 00:38:35,480
which are encoded in a different medium, which I'll show you momentarily.

604
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:44,040
And by doing that, it basically resets the target morphology of these cells

605
00:38:44,040 --> 00:38:46,680
and gets them to build whatever it is that you want them to build.

606
00:38:46,680 --> 00:38:48,200
And I'll show you some examples of that.

607
00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:52,440
But of course, we don't have anything remotely this sophisticated.

608
00:38:52,440 --> 00:38:54,920
We can only do this in a very small number of cases.

609
00:38:54,920 --> 00:38:56,360
Now, why is this important?

610
00:38:56,360 --> 00:39:02,280
Well, aside from the very fundamental aspect that we need this to understand how evolution works,

611
00:39:02,280 --> 00:39:08,840
we needed to understand our origins, and so on, this is the answer to most medical problems,

612
00:39:08,840 --> 00:39:11,080
with the exception of infectious disease.

613
00:39:11,080 --> 00:39:14,680
If you could communicate your goals to a collection of cells,

614
00:39:14,680 --> 00:39:17,320
you would immediately have the solution to birth defects.

615
00:39:17,320 --> 00:39:19,160
You could regenerate after traumatic injury.

616
00:39:19,160 --> 00:39:20,840
You could reprogram and cancer.

617
00:39:20,840 --> 00:39:21,960
You could suppress aging.

618
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:26,840
You could solve degenerative disease.

619
00:39:26,840 --> 00:39:29,000
All of these things boil down to one problem.

620
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:31,320
How do we tell a collection of cells what to build?

621
00:39:31,320 --> 00:39:33,400
If you knew that, all of these problems would go away.

622
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:35,800
So this is a major unmet need.

623
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:37,320
Why do we not have something like this?

624
00:39:37,400 --> 00:39:42,680
I mean, genetics and molecular biology have been working really hard for many decades now.

625
00:39:42,680 --> 00:39:44,360
Why do we not still have this?

626
00:39:44,360 --> 00:39:46,840
I want to show just a simple example.

627
00:39:48,040 --> 00:39:52,200
This is a baby axolotl, and axolotl larvae have little forelegs.

628
00:39:52,200 --> 00:39:57,640
And this is a tadpole of a frog, and these guys do not have forelegs.

629
00:39:57,640 --> 00:40:00,280
And so in my lab, we can make something called a frogolotl,

630
00:40:00,280 --> 00:40:03,880
which basically just means you take a bunch of cells from an early axolotl.

631
00:40:03,880 --> 00:40:05,880
You take a bunch of cells from the early frog.

632
00:40:05,960 --> 00:40:08,120
You put them together, and you got a chimeric embryo

633
00:40:08,120 --> 00:40:10,680
that has some cells from here and some cells from there.

634
00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:13,640
Now, we have both genomes.

635
00:40:13,640 --> 00:40:17,240
We've sequenced the axolotl genome, and we've sequenced the frog genome.

636
00:40:17,240 --> 00:40:19,160
Can anybody tell me, looking at those genomes,

637
00:40:19,160 --> 00:40:21,800
whether frogolotls are going to have legs or not?

638
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:22,600
And the answer is no.

639
00:40:22,600 --> 00:40:23,720
No one can tell you that.

640
00:40:23,720 --> 00:40:30,360
And that is because while we do have some good frameworks for understanding

641
00:40:30,360 --> 00:40:35,240
what a single cell is going to do biochemically by looking at its genome,

642
00:40:35,240 --> 00:40:38,520
we have almost no ability to look at a genome

643
00:40:38,520 --> 00:40:40,680
and guess what the collective is going to do.

644
00:40:40,680 --> 00:40:42,360
Either a pure collective like this,

645
00:40:42,360 --> 00:40:45,960
I mean, you can't even predict the shape of a single animal from its genome either,

646
00:40:45,960 --> 00:40:48,280
but certainly not in these chimeric cases.

647
00:40:48,280 --> 00:40:52,760
What we do not understand yet, despite all the biochemistry and genomics and everything else,

648
00:40:52,760 --> 00:40:55,240
what we don't understand yet is collective decision-making.

649
00:40:55,240 --> 00:40:57,880
We do not understand how cells with specific hardware

650
00:40:57,880 --> 00:41:00,360
make decisions about large-scale shape.

651
00:41:00,360 --> 00:41:02,360
And so here's where we are today.

652
00:41:02,360 --> 00:41:06,920
We're very good at manipulating molecules in cells and making networks and so on,

653
00:41:06,920 --> 00:41:09,800
but we're really a long way from form and function.

654
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:13,240
And I'm going to argue that from controlling large-scale form and function.

655
00:41:13,240 --> 00:41:14,920
And I'm going to argue that the reason for this,

656
00:41:14,920 --> 00:41:18,840
and the thing that holds back really radically transformative regenerative medicine,

657
00:41:19,480 --> 00:41:24,360
is that all of molecular medicine today is roughly like this.

658
00:41:24,360 --> 00:41:27,640
This is what programming looked like in the 40s and 50s.

659
00:41:27,640 --> 00:41:29,240
I mean, you can see what she's doing.

660
00:41:29,240 --> 00:41:33,960
She's literally rewiring the machine by pulling wires in and out.

661
00:41:33,960 --> 00:41:35,480
This is hardware control.

662
00:41:35,480 --> 00:41:39,080
Now, the reason that you don't get out your soldering iron

663
00:41:39,080 --> 00:41:43,560
when it's time to go from Microsoft Word to Photoshop on your laptop

664
00:41:43,560 --> 00:41:47,800
is that what computer science has figured out is that there are higher-level

665
00:41:48,680 --> 00:41:52,680
ways to interact with the system that does not require you to rewire the hardware,

666
00:41:52,680 --> 00:41:58,280
meaning that you're taking advantage of the inherent plasticity competencies

667
00:41:58,280 --> 00:42:02,200
and various other capacities in the software of the system,

668
00:42:02,200 --> 00:42:05,640
in the activity of the system that you can guide with stimuli,

669
00:42:05,640 --> 00:42:09,000
with signals such as hitting a keyboard in the case of the computer.

670
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:11,720
And that's what gave us the information technology revolution.

671
00:42:11,720 --> 00:42:17,000
Biology, to a large extent, is still here because all of the exciting technology,

672
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:21,400
so genome editing, CRISPR, protein engineering, single molecule approaches,

673
00:42:21,400 --> 00:42:23,160
all of it is down at the level of the hardware.

674
00:42:23,160 --> 00:42:25,000
All the excitement is at the level of hardware.

675
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:29,320
We haven't even begun to scratch the surface of what the actual biological

676
00:42:29,320 --> 00:42:34,920
software can do specifically, the intelligence of the various biological components.

677
00:42:34,920 --> 00:42:37,400
Now, what do I mean by, when I say intelligence?

678
00:42:37,400 --> 00:42:38,360
There are many definitions.

679
00:42:38,360 --> 00:42:39,080
I like this one.

680
00:42:39,720 --> 00:42:44,840
This is William James, who gave us a strikingly prescient definition of intelligence.

681
00:42:45,560 --> 00:42:48,600
It's very good because it doesn't say anything about brains or what you're made of

682
00:42:48,600 --> 00:42:49,640
or anything like that.

683
00:42:49,640 --> 00:42:51,080
It's very cybernetic.

684
00:42:51,080 --> 00:42:54,920
It says this, intelligence is some degree of the ability

685
00:42:55,320 --> 00:42:57,880
to reach the same goal by different means.

686
00:42:57,880 --> 00:42:58,600
That's it.

687
00:42:58,600 --> 00:43:01,320
So in order to estimate the intelligence of some system,

688
00:43:01,320 --> 00:43:04,600
whether it's engineered or biological or hybrid,

689
00:43:04,600 --> 00:43:06,280
you have to, it's an empirical question.

690
00:43:06,280 --> 00:43:08,120
You have to name a space that it works in.

691
00:43:08,120 --> 00:43:10,040
You have to say what you think the goal is.

692
00:43:10,040 --> 00:43:13,080
You have to make a claim about what you think the competencies of the system

693
00:43:13,080 --> 00:43:15,640
to reach that goal, despite perturbations.

694
00:43:15,640 --> 00:43:18,440
That's the key is that it's a, you need to do interventions.

695
00:43:18,440 --> 00:43:21,480
You can't say how intelligent something is by simply observing it.

696
00:43:21,480 --> 00:43:25,400
You have to do perturbative experiments to see what goes on

697
00:43:25,400 --> 00:43:28,040
and what it can do to achieve its goal.

698
00:43:28,040 --> 00:43:30,520
And in particular, James gives a very nice example,

699
00:43:30,520 --> 00:43:35,240
which is the spectrum between two magnets trying to get together

700
00:43:35,240 --> 00:43:37,960
and Romeo and Juliet trying to get together.

701
00:43:37,960 --> 00:43:39,720
And the difference is very simple.

702
00:43:39,720 --> 00:43:40,920
And there's many things in between.

703
00:43:40,920 --> 00:43:44,440
If you've got two magnets, they have some competency to try and meet each other.

704
00:43:44,440 --> 00:43:47,400
But if you put a piece of wood in their way, that's it.

705
00:43:47,400 --> 00:43:49,000
They're going to stand there pressed up against it.

706
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:51,160
They have no ability to go around or do anything else.

707
00:43:51,160 --> 00:43:53,320
So that's sort of the minimal competency.

708
00:43:53,320 --> 00:43:55,560
Romeo and Juliet have massive competencies

709
00:43:55,560 --> 00:43:59,240
to go around various physical and social barriers to get what they want.

710
00:43:59,240 --> 00:44:04,840
And in between, there are all sorts of self-driving vehicles, worms and cells

711
00:44:04,840 --> 00:44:09,240
and different kinds of creatures that have different degrees of competency

712
00:44:09,240 --> 00:44:10,840
to reach various goals.

713
00:44:10,840 --> 00:44:12,520
So let's talk about this then.

714
00:44:12,520 --> 00:44:14,360
If that's the definition of intelligence,

715
00:44:15,160 --> 00:44:19,000
let's ask what kind of collective intelligence do these cellular swarms deploy?

716
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:23,560
I've made this argument that the cells of the body making in embryo

717
00:44:23,560 --> 00:44:25,080
are a kind of collective intelligence.

718
00:44:25,800 --> 00:44:30,600
I'm not simply saying that they have a complex outcome.

719
00:44:30,600 --> 00:44:34,120
Feed forward emergence of complexity from simple rules is commonplace.

720
00:44:34,120 --> 00:44:35,000
Many systems do that.

721
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:35,880
That's not what I mean.

722
00:44:35,880 --> 00:44:39,960
They have a specific ability to adapt to perturbations.

723
00:44:39,960 --> 00:44:42,200
That's more than simple emergence.

724
00:44:42,200 --> 00:44:43,800
And let me show you some examples.

725
00:44:43,800 --> 00:44:50,840
So development is quite reliable and has the ability to reach the specific region

726
00:44:50,840 --> 00:44:55,560
of the anatomical amorphous space, meaning the various different configurations

727
00:44:55,560 --> 00:44:58,040
that a body might have to go from here to here.

728
00:44:58,040 --> 00:45:02,760
So you go from a single cell and then two cells to a whole body.

729
00:45:02,760 --> 00:45:07,240
But the amazing thing is that if you cut this embryo in half,

730
00:45:07,240 --> 00:45:09,160
you don't get two half bodies.

731
00:45:09,160 --> 00:45:12,200
You get two perfectly normal monosygotic twins.

732
00:45:12,200 --> 00:45:14,840
So this system is reliable, but it is not hardwired.

733
00:45:14,840 --> 00:45:19,640
In the face of this massive perturbation, it is able to still get to where it's going.

734
00:45:19,640 --> 00:45:23,400
So if you boil everything down to two dimensions, just for sake of illustration,

735
00:45:23,400 --> 00:45:27,320
the normal embryo does this, but the embryo cut in half,

736
00:45:27,320 --> 00:45:29,480
which is in a different location in that space,

737
00:45:29,480 --> 00:45:31,480
actually is able to get to where it needs to go.

738
00:45:31,480 --> 00:45:34,040
In this ensemble of states, this is the goal space.

739
00:45:34,040 --> 00:45:38,920
The goal states in that space, this is what are considered standard human anatomies are.

740
00:45:39,560 --> 00:45:41,480
And there are various other ways to get there.

741
00:45:41,480 --> 00:45:44,840
And there are local maxima that can be avoided and so on.

742
00:45:44,840 --> 00:45:49,320
So being able to navigate to the same region from different starting conditions

743
00:45:49,320 --> 00:45:53,880
is a kind of intelligence that we view as navigation.

744
00:45:53,880 --> 00:45:57,160
Here is an example in an adult organism.

745
00:45:57,800 --> 00:45:59,400
This is an axolotl.

746
00:45:59,400 --> 00:46:00,840
So this is a salamander.

747
00:46:00,840 --> 00:46:06,360
This guy regenerates his limbs, his eyes, jaws, portions of the heart and brain,

748
00:46:06,360 --> 00:46:09,720
spinal cord, ovaries, amazingly regenerative.

749
00:46:09,720 --> 00:46:14,600
What happens is that when a limb is amputated and they bite each other's legs off all the time

750
00:46:14,600 --> 00:46:15,800
when they're when they're housed together.

751
00:46:15,800 --> 00:46:20,440
So this is a natural experiment that happens, whether it's here or here or up here,

752
00:46:20,440 --> 00:46:23,480
the cells will very rapidly build what's needed.

753
00:46:23,480 --> 00:46:26,920
And they make a standard salamander leg and then they stop.

754
00:46:26,920 --> 00:46:31,320
That's the most amazing part of regeneration that first of all,

755
00:46:31,320 --> 00:46:34,680
that it happens exactly the same way no matter what, where you start from.

756
00:46:34,680 --> 00:46:36,280
And second, that it knows when to stop.

757
00:46:36,840 --> 00:46:37,640
When does it stop?

758
00:46:37,640 --> 00:46:40,440
It stops when the correct salamander arm has been completed.

759
00:46:40,440 --> 00:46:43,320
So you can see that what this is is an error minimization scheme.

760
00:46:43,320 --> 00:46:48,440
This is a system that is going to keep working and changing until a large scale

761
00:46:48,440 --> 00:46:51,880
set point of target morphology that looks like this has been reached.

762
00:46:51,880 --> 00:46:54,600
Now, by the way, this is not just for frogs and worms.

763
00:46:56,360 --> 00:46:57,480
There are some examples.

764
00:46:57,480 --> 00:47:00,760
So for example, the human liver is highly regenerative.

765
00:47:00,760 --> 00:47:02,040
Even the ancient Greeks knew that.

766
00:47:02,040 --> 00:47:04,120
I have no idea how they knew that, but they did.

767
00:47:05,400 --> 00:47:07,400
Human children can regenerate their fingertips.

768
00:47:07,400 --> 00:47:10,920
So below a certain age, they will have a cosmetically very, very nice

769
00:47:10,920 --> 00:47:13,240
regeneration of a fingertip amputation.

770
00:47:13,240 --> 00:47:18,200
And deer are a large adult mammal that regenerates a centimeter and a half

771
00:47:18,200 --> 00:47:20,360
of new bone per day when they're growing this.

772
00:47:20,360 --> 00:47:24,680
So bone, vasculature, innervation, skin, all of it.

773
00:47:24,680 --> 00:47:28,280
So this ability, and in fact, in the correct pattern.

774
00:47:28,280 --> 00:47:32,760
So this ability to regenerate is sprinkled throughout the tree of life.

775
00:47:32,760 --> 00:47:34,120
It is really fundamental.

776
00:47:34,200 --> 00:47:39,480
I want to show you one of my maybe all-time examples of creative problem

777
00:47:39,480 --> 00:47:41,880
solving in this kind of space.

778
00:47:42,520 --> 00:47:47,160
So in that salamander that I showed you, in the nude, if you take a section

779
00:47:47,160 --> 00:47:51,160
through a little tubule that goes to the kidney, you see that it's like

780
00:47:51,160 --> 00:47:56,520
eight or 10 cells typically that work together to make this lumen.

781
00:47:56,520 --> 00:48:00,600
One trick you can do is you can make the cells large.

782
00:48:00,600 --> 00:48:02,680
You can force the cells to be larger.

783
00:48:02,680 --> 00:48:07,720
And if you do that, what happens is it adjusts fewer, fewer of those cells

784
00:48:07,720 --> 00:48:11,160
are there to make the same, roughly the same size of lumen.

785
00:48:11,160 --> 00:48:15,160
That's already amazing that it adjusts the number of cells to the size of each cell.

786
00:48:17,320 --> 00:48:23,000
And that, you know, to being a new born into this world, the embryo cannot

787
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:25,640
count on having the right size of cells.

788
00:48:25,640 --> 00:48:27,720
It has to adapt on the fly.

789
00:48:27,720 --> 00:48:30,200
This is one of many things you can't count on as an embryo.

790
00:48:30,200 --> 00:48:33,240
You have to solve these problems from scratch every time.

791
00:48:33,240 --> 00:48:35,400
So what it'll do is it'll use the right number of cells.

792
00:48:35,400 --> 00:48:41,000
But if you make the cells truly gigantic, one single cell will bend around itself

793
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:43,640
and leave a space in the middle to give you that tubule.

794
00:48:43,640 --> 00:48:46,680
What's amazing about this is that this is a completely different molecular

795
00:48:46,680 --> 00:48:47,800
mechanism than this.

796
00:48:47,800 --> 00:48:51,480
In other words, this is some sort of cell-to-cell communication tubulogenesis

797
00:48:51,480 --> 00:48:52,120
kind of a thing.

798
00:48:52,120 --> 00:48:53,720
This is cytoskeletal bending.

799
00:48:53,720 --> 00:48:55,720
This is a single cell bending around itself.

800
00:48:55,720 --> 00:48:56,840
So look what's going on here.

801
00:48:56,840 --> 00:49:01,320
Different molecular mechanisms are being called up in the service

802
00:49:01,320 --> 00:49:03,240
of a high-level anatomical goal.

803
00:49:03,240 --> 00:49:05,880
This is what's known as top-down causation.

804
00:49:05,880 --> 00:49:10,200
In the service of a particular anatomical goal, different molecular mechanisms

805
00:49:10,200 --> 00:49:13,720
can be called up.

806
00:49:13,720 --> 00:49:18,760
So this ability to adjust to circumstance has to do with external circumstances,

807
00:49:18,760 --> 00:49:21,400
like being injured or being cut in half or losing a limb,

808
00:49:21,400 --> 00:49:23,240
but also internal circumstances.

809
00:49:23,240 --> 00:49:26,200
Not only can't you count on your body maintaining a particular shape,

810
00:49:26,200 --> 00:49:27,720
you can't even count on your own parts.

811
00:49:27,720 --> 00:49:30,680
You have no idea what size your cells are going to be when you come into the world

812
00:49:30,680 --> 00:49:32,680
and you still have to be able to solve this problem.

813
00:49:32,680 --> 00:49:34,600
So this is amazing.

814
00:49:34,600 --> 00:49:37,560
And again, not through eons of evolutionary change.

815
00:49:37,560 --> 00:49:40,600
This happens immediately in one generation.

816
00:49:41,240 --> 00:49:46,120
So the final example I want to show you is something that we discovered a few years ago.

817
00:49:47,400 --> 00:49:49,320
Here's a normal tappel here.

818
00:49:49,320 --> 00:49:52,920
The eyes, the brain, the nostrils, and the mouth is here.

819
00:49:52,920 --> 00:49:55,640
So these tappels have to become a fraud

820
00:49:55,640 --> 00:49:56,920
in order to become a fraud.

821
00:49:56,920 --> 00:49:58,200
They have to rearrange their face.

822
00:49:58,200 --> 00:49:59,400
So the jaws have to move forward.

823
00:49:59,400 --> 00:50:01,480
The eyes have to come in various things like that.

824
00:50:02,040 --> 00:50:04,920
And it was thought that this is a hard-wired process.

825
00:50:04,920 --> 00:50:09,560
Basically, every organ in the face moves in a certain direction, a certain amount.

826
00:50:09,560 --> 00:50:13,160
And that way, if you just know which direction

827
00:50:13,160 --> 00:50:16,120
and how much you'll go from a standard tappel to a standard fraud.

828
00:50:16,120 --> 00:50:20,040
We made the hypothesis that this was actually a more intelligent process than that.

829
00:50:20,040 --> 00:50:22,200
And so how do you test it with perturbation?

830
00:50:22,200 --> 00:50:25,080
So what we did was we created what we call Picasso tappels.

831
00:50:25,080 --> 00:50:27,720
So the eye is off to the side.

832
00:50:27,720 --> 00:50:28,920
The jaws are on top of the head.

833
00:50:28,920 --> 00:50:31,560
Everything is kind of scrambled.

834
00:50:31,560 --> 00:50:36,040
And what we found is that even those animals generally make pretty normal frogs.

835
00:50:36,040 --> 00:50:40,360
Because all of these organs move in novel unnatural paths

836
00:50:40,360 --> 00:50:42,520
to get to where they're going and then they stop.

837
00:50:42,520 --> 00:50:43,880
Actually, they sometimes overshoot.

838
00:50:43,880 --> 00:50:45,800
They sometimes go too far and then have to come back.

839
00:50:45,800 --> 00:50:50,680
But all of these things move around until they get to a pretty normal frog face.

840
00:50:50,680 --> 00:50:57,000
So what this is, is this idea that genetics isn't specifying some kind of hardware rearrangement,

841
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:58,440
hard-wired rearrangements.

842
00:50:58,440 --> 00:51:01,480
What it actually specifies is a problem-solving machine,

843
00:51:01,480 --> 00:51:03,560
and we'll get to more of this in the third part of the talk,

844
00:51:04,360 --> 00:51:08,280
that can recognize unexpected states and take corrective action.

845
00:51:08,280 --> 00:51:10,040
It's an error minimization scheme.

846
00:51:10,760 --> 00:51:12,280
So how might that work?

847
00:51:12,280 --> 00:51:15,240
And here's what we have.

848
00:51:15,240 --> 00:51:18,440
The standard story of developmental biology looks like this.

849
00:51:18,440 --> 00:51:21,720
There are genes that interact with each other as gene-regulatory networks.

850
00:51:21,720 --> 00:51:23,800
They make proteins, which do things.

851
00:51:23,800 --> 00:51:24,680
Some of them are sticky.

852
00:51:24,680 --> 00:51:25,560
Some of them diffuse.

853
00:51:25,560 --> 00:51:27,000
Some of them exert force and so on.

854
00:51:27,560 --> 00:51:29,880
And then there's this process of emergence.

855
00:51:29,880 --> 00:51:31,880
So simple rules lead to complex outcomes,

856
00:51:31,880 --> 00:51:34,360
and you get this kind of beautiful anatomy.

857
00:51:34,360 --> 00:51:35,320
And this is all true.

858
00:51:35,320 --> 00:51:36,360
This all happens.

859
00:51:36,360 --> 00:51:42,200
But this leaves out a really critical component, which this is all feed-forward emergence.

860
00:51:42,200 --> 00:51:47,640
But there are all these feedback loops that if you step away from this target morphology,

861
00:51:47,720 --> 00:51:53,480
either by injury or by teratogens or by mutations or anything else,

862
00:51:54,360 --> 00:51:57,560
all kinds of processes at the level of physics and genetics get activated

863
00:51:57,560 --> 00:51:58,920
to try and get you back there.

864
00:51:58,920 --> 00:52:00,680
There's that error minimization scheme,

865
00:52:00,680 --> 00:52:05,800
which is really a kind of anatomical homeostasis or pattern homeostasis.

866
00:52:06,360 --> 00:52:08,680
And a couple of interesting things about this.

867
00:52:09,880 --> 00:52:13,880
On the one hand, this is, but biologists know all about feedback loops.

868
00:52:13,880 --> 00:52:14,600
It's pretty obvious.

869
00:52:15,080 --> 00:52:19,720
But on the other hand, most of the feedback loops we know about are scalar.

870
00:52:22,360 --> 00:52:25,080
All of these homeostatic loops require a set point.

871
00:52:25,080 --> 00:52:29,320
They need to know like a thermostat needs to know what is the thing with respect

872
00:52:29,320 --> 00:52:30,600
to which we calculate error.

873
00:52:31,480 --> 00:52:36,440
Most of these examples of homeostasis in biology are scalar numbers.

874
00:52:36,440 --> 00:52:39,240
They're pH or temperature level or hunger level or something.

875
00:52:39,240 --> 00:52:40,840
I got there a simple quantity.

876
00:52:40,920 --> 00:52:45,320
In this case, we're talking about the set point of this process being a complex

877
00:52:45,320 --> 00:52:46,760
anatomical descriptor.

878
00:52:46,760 --> 00:52:48,760
It doesn't have to be an exact cell by cell kind of thing,

879
00:52:48,760 --> 00:52:51,800
but some general notion of what the correct shape should be

880
00:52:51,800 --> 00:52:53,640
or the correct length of limbs and stuff like that.

881
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:55,800
So that's unusual.

882
00:52:55,800 --> 00:52:59,960
And of course, the whole notion of a process that's in some sense goal directed

883
00:52:59,960 --> 00:53:01,160
is a kind of taboo.

884
00:53:01,160 --> 00:53:06,840
There's a real what I call teleophobia out there about people are really suspicious

885
00:53:06,840 --> 00:53:09,080
about models of processes with goals.

886
00:53:09,080 --> 00:53:14,760
But I think that cybernetics since the 40s has given us a mature non-magical science

887
00:53:14,760 --> 00:53:15,800
of systems with goals.

888
00:53:15,800 --> 00:53:16,840
So I think it's okay.

889
00:53:17,640 --> 00:53:23,480
But something interesting about this is that if you only know about the first part of this,

890
00:53:23,480 --> 00:53:27,640
then when you want to make changes up here, let's say for biomedical purposes,

891
00:53:28,840 --> 00:53:32,440
your only game plan is to alter the genome.

892
00:53:32,440 --> 00:53:34,600
And that means you have to solve this inverse problem.

893
00:53:34,600 --> 00:53:39,880
You have to ask if I wanted a different shape up here, which genes would I have to change?

894
00:53:39,880 --> 00:53:43,560
And as we talked about a few minutes ago, that is in general an unsolvable problem

895
00:53:43,560 --> 00:53:47,560
because this process is so complex and so convoluted.

896
00:53:47,560 --> 00:53:48,760
You can't just reverse it.

897
00:53:48,760 --> 00:53:51,000
You don't know which genes to change.

898
00:53:51,560 --> 00:53:56,200
But if there is kind of this homeostasis relative to a set point,

899
00:53:56,200 --> 00:53:57,480
then you've got a different strategy.

900
00:53:57,480 --> 00:54:03,880
Maybe this isn't at the mechanical clock part of that continuum that I showed you.

901
00:54:03,880 --> 00:54:08,760
Maybe this is closer to that thermostat level where you can actually change the set point.

902
00:54:08,760 --> 00:54:14,600
You can revise the set point without having to change the hardware without changing the

903
00:54:14,600 --> 00:54:15,080
genes at all.

904
00:54:15,080 --> 00:54:16,680
And this is what I'm going to show you now.

905
00:54:16,680 --> 00:54:21,320
So what we wanted was, and this is years of work on this now,

906
00:54:22,280 --> 00:54:26,840
what we wanted was to, if this is all true, we should be able to do a couple of things.

907
00:54:26,840 --> 00:54:30,760
First of all, we should be able to identify where that set point is stored.

908
00:54:30,760 --> 00:54:33,000
And I'm going to show you that, decode it.

909
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:36,040
And I'm going to show you a couple of examples of how we can actually read it

910
00:54:36,040 --> 00:54:37,560
and understand what it says.

911
00:54:37,560 --> 00:54:41,560
And we should be able to rewrite it and let the cells build to the new pattern

912
00:54:41,560 --> 00:54:43,160
without changing out the hardware.

913
00:54:43,160 --> 00:54:44,280
Let me show you that.

914
00:54:44,280 --> 00:54:45,640
So how might this work?

915
00:54:45,640 --> 00:54:48,120
At the very beginning of this, I started thinking about, okay,

916
00:54:48,120 --> 00:54:52,120
how can we even talk about cells and tissues storing a goal state,

917
00:54:52,120 --> 00:54:55,720
storing some kind of a target for all this activity?

918
00:54:56,440 --> 00:55:01,240
And of course, the one really good uncontroversial example of a biological system

919
00:55:01,240 --> 00:55:04,360
that stores goal states and acts towards them is the brain.

920
00:55:04,360 --> 00:55:07,160
This is what complex creatures do all the time.

921
00:55:07,160 --> 00:55:11,320
So the brain stores memories of target states,

922
00:55:11,320 --> 00:55:15,080
and it acts in three-dimensional space to achieve those goals.

923
00:55:15,080 --> 00:55:16,280
How does it do it?

924
00:55:16,280 --> 00:55:19,000
Well, the hardware looks like this.

925
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:22,040
This is an electrical network where you've got cells.

926
00:55:22,680 --> 00:55:25,240
The cells have little ion channels in their membrane,

927
00:55:25,240 --> 00:55:28,200
which allows them to pass things like potassium, sodium, and so on.

928
00:55:28,200 --> 00:55:30,920
They acquire, by doing that, they acquire a voltage gradient,

929
00:55:30,920 --> 00:55:33,400
a difference, voltage difference between inside and out.

930
00:55:33,400 --> 00:55:36,760
And that voltage gradient may or may not be communicated to the neighboring cells

931
00:55:36,760 --> 00:55:39,960
through these little electric synapses known as gap junctions.

932
00:55:39,960 --> 00:55:44,520
So you have a network of cells that can store different states electrically,

933
00:55:44,520 --> 00:55:46,200
and they can propagate information,

934
00:55:46,200 --> 00:55:48,440
and that information spreads to the network.

935
00:55:48,440 --> 00:55:50,920
And that is what runs the software of the brain.

936
00:55:50,920 --> 00:55:55,000
And so what you can see here is this group made this amazing video

937
00:55:55,000 --> 00:56:00,120
of real-time electrical signaling in the zebrafish, a living zebrafish brain.

938
00:56:00,120 --> 00:56:06,600
So you can see here's what's going on as the fish is thinking about

939
00:56:06,600 --> 00:56:08,040
whatever fish think about.

940
00:56:08,040 --> 00:56:10,840
And it is a commitment of neuroscience

941
00:56:10,840 --> 00:56:14,760
that if we were able to read out these electrical signals,

942
00:56:15,320 --> 00:56:18,600
we could decode them and thus know what the fish is thinking.

943
00:56:18,600 --> 00:56:23,160
We should be able to recover the memories, the goals, the various preferences,

944
00:56:23,160 --> 00:56:26,600
the behavioral repertoires, and so on by decoding this.

945
00:56:26,600 --> 00:56:32,600
So to summarize, and this is the project of neural decoding here in neuroscience,

946
00:56:32,600 --> 00:56:36,440
where you try to image the brain and you make a model

947
00:56:36,440 --> 00:56:39,720
and you understand what that animal is thinking or seeing and so on.

948
00:56:39,720 --> 00:56:45,880
And so the idea is that according to neuroscience,

949
00:56:45,880 --> 00:56:49,080
the bioelectrical signaling in the brain is literally the medium

950
00:56:49,080 --> 00:56:51,800
that contains the cognitive content of the mind.

951
00:56:51,800 --> 00:56:54,520
So you as a person, all your memories and thoughts and everything else

952
00:56:54,520 --> 00:56:58,040
is in some way encoded in the electrophysiology of your brain.

953
00:56:58,040 --> 00:57:00,760
Well, the amazing thing is that this ancient...

954
00:57:00,760 --> 00:57:02,520
So that's a really neat trick, right?

955
00:57:02,520 --> 00:57:05,000
That combination of hardware and software is amazing.

956
00:57:05,800 --> 00:57:09,880
But what's really interesting is that architecture,

957
00:57:09,880 --> 00:57:12,200
the architecture of having this electrical hardware

958
00:57:12,200 --> 00:57:18,680
and thus this very plastic goal seeking clever and problem-solving software

959
00:57:18,680 --> 00:57:20,360
is absolutely ancient.

960
00:57:20,360 --> 00:57:23,160
So every cell in your body has ion channels.

961
00:57:23,160 --> 00:57:27,240
Most of them have gab junctions to neighboring cells.

962
00:57:27,240 --> 00:57:32,520
This is not something that's just for neural cells

963
00:57:32,520 --> 00:57:35,880
and it's something that's been around since the time of bacterial biofilms.

964
00:57:35,880 --> 00:57:39,240
This is evolution figured out this architecture very early on.

965
00:57:39,240 --> 00:57:44,520
And so then one can try to extend this and basically this is the project

966
00:57:44,520 --> 00:57:47,560
and this is what we've been doing for almost 30 years now

967
00:57:47,560 --> 00:57:51,720
is this idea of extending neuroscience beyond neurons.

968
00:57:51,720 --> 00:57:56,680
The real kind of magic of neuroscience is not in the neurons.

969
00:57:56,680 --> 00:58:00,440
It's in this understanding, this scaling up of cognition.

970
00:58:00,440 --> 00:58:05,560
And so what you might imagine is doing exactly the same kind of neural decoding thing,

971
00:58:05,560 --> 00:58:06,520
but not on neurons.

972
00:58:06,520 --> 00:58:09,560
Let's say on embryos or some other morphogenetic system to ask,

973
00:58:10,280 --> 00:58:13,400
here you're asking what is the collective intelligence of neurons thinking.

974
00:58:13,960 --> 00:58:16,600
Here you're asking for what is the collective intelligence

975
00:58:16,600 --> 00:58:20,760
of the rest of the body cells thinking quite literally.

976
00:58:21,560 --> 00:58:24,760
And I can use the thing is, this sounds very strange

977
00:58:24,760 --> 00:58:28,680
and a lot of people will say that this is some kind of a weird misuse of a metaphor.

978
00:58:28,680 --> 00:58:32,440
But the reason that I can apply all this terminology from neuroscience

979
00:58:32,520 --> 00:58:38,600
to outside the brain is because the concepts, the tools, the reagents

980
00:58:38,600 --> 00:58:42,600
cannot tell the difference between neurons and non-neural tissues.

981
00:58:42,600 --> 00:58:45,480
All of the same tools and concepts work everywhere in the body.

982
00:58:45,480 --> 00:58:46,760
This is what we've been showing.

983
00:58:46,760 --> 00:58:50,360
And so the concepts are actually very isomorphic.

984
00:58:50,360 --> 00:58:56,040
And so what you have here is that whereas the electrical network,

985
00:58:56,040 --> 00:58:57,880
just to kind of summarize what I'm saying here,

986
00:58:58,440 --> 00:59:03,320
the electrical network of the brain is giving commands to the muscles

987
00:59:03,320 --> 00:59:05,800
to move you through three dimensional space.

988
00:59:05,800 --> 00:59:08,520
That's the familiar version of neuroscience.

989
00:59:08,520 --> 00:59:10,840
And then we can modify it with various techniques

990
00:59:10,840 --> 00:59:12,520
and we can read it out and so on.

991
00:59:12,520 --> 00:59:15,720
So the electrical network of the brain tells muscles what to do

992
00:59:15,720 --> 00:59:17,800
to move you in three dimensional space.

993
00:59:17,800 --> 00:59:19,880
But the reason it can do that is because it evolved

994
00:59:19,880 --> 00:59:23,560
from a much more ancient system in other tissues in your body

995
00:59:23,640 --> 00:59:26,440
that long before brains and muscles evolved,

996
00:59:26,440 --> 00:59:32,120
we're telling all the cells how to rearrange your body shape

997
00:59:32,120 --> 00:59:35,400
and thus move you in anatomical morphospace.

998
00:59:35,400 --> 00:59:39,640
Same strategy, same hardware, same tricks, except it's a different space.

999
00:59:39,640 --> 00:59:42,360
And so this is what I said before when I said that evolution

1000
00:59:42,360 --> 00:59:45,000
was pivoting us through various problem spaces.

1001
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:49,480
So what we did was to develop the first molecular tools

1002
00:59:49,480 --> 00:59:53,160
to read and write this information outside of the nervous system.

1003
00:59:53,160 --> 00:59:54,440
So how do we do that?

1004
00:59:54,440 --> 00:59:59,160
So the first thing is a voltage sensitive fluorescent dye.

1005
00:59:59,160 --> 01:00:03,320
So this is a chemical that emits either different brightness

1006
01:00:03,320 --> 01:00:07,080
or different wavelengths, light depending on the electrical properties

1007
01:00:07,080 --> 01:00:08,440
of the cell that it's sitting in.

1008
01:00:08,440 --> 01:00:13,400
And so what you're seeing here is a time lapse of a frog embryo

1009
01:00:13,400 --> 01:00:15,160
as during the early stages.

1010
01:00:15,160 --> 01:00:19,000
And so the colors represent different voltages.

1011
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:23,720
And so this is a kind of brain scan, if you will,

1012
01:00:24,440 --> 01:00:27,400
of all the conversations that the cells are having with each other

1013
01:00:27,400 --> 01:00:30,120
as they sort out who's going to be left, who's going to be right,

1014
01:00:30,120 --> 01:00:33,240
who's going to be anterior, posterior, dorsal, ventral, and so on.

1015
01:00:33,240 --> 01:00:39,800
And so we now have the ability to read out this kind of information.

1016
01:00:39,800 --> 01:00:42,440
We spend a lot of time doing computer simulations

1017
01:00:42,440 --> 01:00:46,440
to figure out how these patterns map onto the patterns of ion channels

1018
01:00:46,440 --> 01:00:48,200
that are present in the cell membranes.

1019
01:00:48,200 --> 01:00:49,720
I want to show you two kinds of patterns.

1020
01:00:50,440 --> 01:00:52,360
The first we call the electric face.

1021
01:00:52,360 --> 01:00:53,800
And this is, again, a time lapse.

1022
01:00:53,800 --> 01:00:56,760
Now here, it's gray scale instead of color, but it's the same idea.

1023
01:00:56,760 --> 01:00:59,160
The brightness represents voltage.

1024
01:00:59,160 --> 01:01:02,440
And so in this early frog embryo that's putting its face together,

1025
01:01:02,440 --> 01:01:04,920
there's all kinds of changes, lots of exciting stuff happening.

1026
01:01:04,920 --> 01:01:06,920
But look at this one frame taken from it.

1027
01:01:08,120 --> 01:01:11,960
Long before the genes are turned on to make the different parts of the face,

1028
01:01:11,960 --> 01:01:14,360
we can already see what this animal is going to do.

1029
01:01:14,360 --> 01:01:16,200
Here's where the animal's right eye is going to be.

1030
01:01:16,200 --> 01:01:17,720
Here's where the mouth is going to be.

1031
01:01:17,720 --> 01:01:19,720
The left eye comes in slightly thereafter.

1032
01:01:19,720 --> 01:01:21,160
You will see that momentarily.

1033
01:01:22,680 --> 01:01:25,160
Here are the placodes on the sides.

1034
01:01:25,160 --> 01:01:29,080
The B pattern of where everything is going to go

1035
01:01:29,080 --> 01:01:34,840
is already there in the stable electrical states of the cells

1036
01:01:34,840 --> 01:01:36,440
if you know how to read them out.

1037
01:01:36,440 --> 01:01:37,880
So this is the electric face.

1038
01:01:37,880 --> 01:01:42,520
And I'm going to show you in a minute that if you make changes here,

1039
01:01:42,520 --> 01:01:43,880
you will change gene expression.

1040
01:01:43,880 --> 01:01:44,920
You will change anatomy.

1041
01:01:44,920 --> 01:01:47,240
Therefore, this pattern is instructive.

1042
01:01:47,320 --> 01:01:47,960
It drives.

1043
01:01:47,960 --> 01:01:49,960
This is not just some sort of epiphenomenon.

1044
01:01:49,960 --> 01:01:55,080
This is actually the memory of what the cells are going to be doing

1045
01:01:55,800 --> 01:01:56,600
to make the face.

1046
01:01:56,600 --> 01:01:58,040
So that's a natural pattern.

1047
01:01:58,040 --> 01:02:01,480
But here's a pathological pattern.

1048
01:02:01,480 --> 01:02:04,040
And we'll talk more about cancer in the third part of the talk.

1049
01:02:04,040 --> 01:02:08,440
If I inject a human oncogene, there will be a tumor.

1050
01:02:10,040 --> 01:02:11,720
But before that tumor forms,

1051
01:02:11,720 --> 01:02:19,080
I can already see where the cells are starting to defect.

1052
01:02:19,080 --> 01:02:21,240
They acquire this abnormal bioelectric state.

1053
01:02:21,880 --> 01:02:23,640
And I can already see where the tumor is going to be.

1054
01:02:23,640 --> 01:02:25,240
So this is a pathological pattern.

1055
01:02:25,240 --> 01:02:27,560
So in addition to being able to observe all this stuff,

1056
01:02:27,560 --> 01:02:30,120
which is nice, but it's just observation,

1057
01:02:31,320 --> 01:02:34,600
what we developed were a set of tools patterned on exactly the same thing

1058
01:02:34,600 --> 01:02:38,200
done in neuroscience to study synaptic plasticity and intrinsic plasticity.

1059
01:02:38,760 --> 01:02:43,400
And basically be able to, so I showed you how to read the patterns.

1060
01:02:43,400 --> 01:02:44,920
I'm showing you how to write the patterns.

1061
01:02:44,920 --> 01:02:48,840
So you can rewrite those patterns by manipulating the gap junctions,

1062
01:02:48,840 --> 01:02:50,200
these electrical synapses.

1063
01:02:50,200 --> 01:02:53,000
So that controls the connectivity of this network.

1064
01:02:53,000 --> 01:02:55,880
Or you can actually open channels, open them,

1065
01:02:56,920 --> 01:02:59,240
using drugs or close them using drugs, using light,

1066
01:02:59,240 --> 01:03:03,320
the various kinds of stimuli to control the voltage of every cell.

1067
01:03:03,320 --> 01:03:06,200
So to be clear, there are no applied fields.

1068
01:03:06,200 --> 01:03:07,400
There are no electrodes.

1069
01:03:07,400 --> 01:03:09,480
There's no electromagnetic radiation.

1070
01:03:09,480 --> 01:03:11,160
There are no magnets, nothing like that.

1071
01:03:11,160 --> 01:03:16,520
This is molecular physiology using the natural interface

1072
01:03:16,520 --> 01:03:18,280
that these cells are exposing to us.

1073
01:03:18,280 --> 01:03:21,560
These, this is the same interface that they use to hack each other.

1074
01:03:21,560 --> 01:03:23,720
These are, this is the way the cells are communicating,

1075
01:03:23,720 --> 01:03:25,000
and we're just hijacking it.

1076
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:27,400
So there are no external fields, nothing like that.

1077
01:03:28,680 --> 01:03:32,680
Okay, so using this technology then, we know what happens

1078
01:03:32,680 --> 01:03:33,640
when you use it in the brain.

1079
01:03:33,640 --> 01:03:35,960
So somebody like Tanagawa at MIT can use this

1080
01:03:35,960 --> 01:03:39,240
to put false memories into the brains of mice,

1081
01:03:39,240 --> 01:03:41,560
using exactly this technology in the brain.

1082
01:03:41,560 --> 01:03:43,720
We are going to put false memories

1083
01:03:43,720 --> 01:03:47,240
into the somatic networks of cells that are building the body.

1084
01:03:47,240 --> 01:03:49,000
So when you do that, here's what happens.

1085
01:03:49,640 --> 01:03:54,280
You can convince cells to make ectopic hearts like this.

1086
01:03:54,280 --> 01:03:56,120
Here are some extra hearts in the tadpole.

1087
01:03:56,120 --> 01:03:57,400
You can make extra limbs.

1088
01:03:57,400 --> 01:04:00,200
So you can ask the cells in the jaw to start generating a limb.

1089
01:04:00,200 --> 01:04:03,480
And here are some six-legged frogs here.

1090
01:04:03,480 --> 01:04:05,240
You can make ectopic forebrain.

1091
01:04:05,240 --> 01:04:08,200
You can make ectopic inner ear organs right here.

1092
01:04:08,200 --> 01:04:09,480
Or you can even make fins.

1093
01:04:09,480 --> 01:04:10,680
Now that's especially weird

1094
01:04:10,680 --> 01:04:12,360
because tadpoles aren't supposed to have fins.

1095
01:04:12,360 --> 01:04:14,920
And I'll show you some of that momentarily.

1096
01:04:14,920 --> 01:04:16,760
But here's one of my favorite examples.

1097
01:04:17,640 --> 01:04:19,480
I showed you, if you remember that electric face,

1098
01:04:19,480 --> 01:04:20,920
one of the things about that electric face

1099
01:04:20,920 --> 01:04:24,200
was that there was a pattern that said where the eye should go.

1100
01:04:24,200 --> 01:04:27,000
It represented the location where the cells should become an eye.

1101
01:04:27,080 --> 01:04:30,200
And so we simply said, okay, if we try to reproduce

1102
01:04:30,200 --> 01:04:31,960
that electrical state elsewhere in the body,

1103
01:04:31,960 --> 01:04:35,480
can we induce some other kinds of cells to be an eye?

1104
01:04:37,240 --> 01:04:37,800
And so we did.

1105
01:04:37,800 --> 01:04:40,360
So we injected some mRNA encoding,

1106
01:04:40,360 --> 01:04:44,920
some potassium channels into a different type of cells

1107
01:04:44,920 --> 01:04:47,400
that were not going to be that region.

1108
01:04:47,400 --> 01:04:48,840
In particular, they were this gut.

1109
01:04:48,840 --> 01:04:50,200
They were fated to be gut.

1110
01:04:50,200 --> 01:04:53,560
And if you do that, if you create that pattern in those cells,

1111
01:04:53,560 --> 01:04:55,960
sure enough, they will make, they will build an eye.

1112
01:04:55,960 --> 01:04:58,920
And these eyes will have all the right cell layers.

1113
01:04:58,920 --> 01:05:02,920
So retinal lens, optic nerve, they'll have all that stuff.

1114
01:05:02,920 --> 01:05:04,600
Notice, notice a couple of interesting things.

1115
01:05:04,600 --> 01:05:08,520
Number one, this bioelectric pattern is instructive.

1116
01:05:08,520 --> 01:05:09,720
It tells cells what to do.

1117
01:05:09,720 --> 01:05:11,480
It doesn't just ruin the old pattern,

1118
01:05:11,480 --> 01:05:13,720
it actually can call up whole organs.

1119
01:05:13,720 --> 01:05:17,800
Number two, it expands the notion of competency.

1120
01:05:17,800 --> 01:05:19,720
In the developmental biology textbook,

1121
01:05:19,720 --> 01:05:22,920
what you will read is that only these cells up here

1122
01:05:22,920 --> 01:05:24,360
in the anterior and directed room

1123
01:05:24,360 --> 01:05:26,280
are actually competent to become eye.

1124
01:05:26,280 --> 01:05:29,080
And that's true if you use the traditional way of inducing eyes,

1125
01:05:29,080 --> 01:05:31,240
which is this master eye gene called PAC-6.

1126
01:05:31,240 --> 01:05:33,480
But it's not true if you go up a level

1127
01:05:33,480 --> 01:05:36,440
and use the bioelectric signals, you can make eyes anywhere.

1128
01:05:36,440 --> 01:05:38,280
So it completely changes our idea.

1129
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:41,160
Learning to hack these cells in a different way

1130
01:05:41,160 --> 01:05:44,600
changes this, our understanding of their competency.

1131
01:05:45,960 --> 01:05:48,440
And notice the third thing that's amazing

1132
01:05:48,440 --> 01:05:51,560
is that we didn't provide very much information at all.

1133
01:05:51,560 --> 01:05:52,760
I mean, eyes are very complex.

1134
01:05:52,840 --> 01:05:55,080
We didn't tell this animal how to make an eye.

1135
01:05:55,080 --> 01:05:59,720
We basically just triggered the eye morphogenetic subroutine

1136
01:05:59,720 --> 01:06:02,280
with a simple trigger that says build an eye here.

1137
01:06:02,280 --> 01:06:02,680
That's it.

1138
01:06:02,680 --> 01:06:04,200
We didn't say where the stem cells go

1139
01:06:04,200 --> 01:06:06,120
or how to make a retina, none of that.

1140
01:06:06,120 --> 01:06:07,240
It's very modular.

1141
01:06:07,240 --> 01:06:08,840
It's very hierarchical.

1142
01:06:09,960 --> 01:06:13,960
And so the next kind of part of this

1143
01:06:13,960 --> 01:06:15,480
that's my favorite is this.

1144
01:06:15,480 --> 01:06:18,440
Here's a lens, an ectopic lens sitting out

1145
01:06:18,440 --> 01:06:20,040
in the tail of a tadpole somewhere.

1146
01:06:20,040 --> 01:06:21,800
So we've induced the lens.

1147
01:06:21,800 --> 01:06:23,320
The way we've induced it is just like here.

1148
01:06:23,320 --> 01:06:25,080
We injected some ion channels.

1149
01:06:25,080 --> 01:06:28,760
These ion channels are labeled with this blue beta-gal signal.

1150
01:06:29,720 --> 01:06:32,200
So what you can see here is that the blue cells are the ones

1151
01:06:32,200 --> 01:06:34,120
to which we said build an eye.

1152
01:06:35,160 --> 01:06:37,800
But there's not enough of them to build a proper lens.

1153
01:06:37,800 --> 01:06:38,600
And so what did they do?

1154
01:06:38,600 --> 01:06:41,080
They recruited a bunch of their nearby buddies,

1155
01:06:41,080 --> 01:06:43,560
all of this stuff here that we never touched.

1156
01:06:44,360 --> 01:06:45,880
So it's a secondary instruction.

1157
01:06:45,880 --> 01:06:48,040
We instruct these cells to make an eye.

1158
01:06:48,040 --> 01:06:50,040
They instruct their neighbors to work with them

1159
01:06:50,040 --> 01:06:51,240
to complete the task.

1160
01:06:51,240 --> 01:06:53,560
This is something you see in other collective intelligence

1161
01:06:53,560 --> 01:06:56,760
is like ants, where when a few ants come across a project

1162
01:06:56,760 --> 01:06:58,520
that's too big for them to handle, what do they do?

1163
01:06:58,520 --> 01:06:59,960
They recruit others.

1164
01:06:59,960 --> 01:07:03,400
And so this ability of the system to self-scale

1165
01:07:03,400 --> 01:07:05,400
to the available problem is something

1166
01:07:05,400 --> 01:07:07,080
that you see in other collective intelligences.

1167
01:07:07,080 --> 01:07:10,760
So we don't have to tell these cells how big an eye should be

1168
01:07:10,760 --> 01:07:12,360
or how many cells there should be.

1169
01:07:12,360 --> 01:07:14,120
All of this is part of the competency

1170
01:07:14,120 --> 01:07:17,480
of this amazing agential medium in which we're working.

1171
01:07:17,480 --> 01:07:19,160
And we'll get to that notion.

1172
01:07:19,160 --> 01:07:21,720
But the fact that these cells are solving problems collectively,

1173
01:07:21,720 --> 01:07:24,040
they know how big this group is.

1174
01:07:24,040 --> 01:07:25,480
They know how big it's supposed to be.

1175
01:07:25,480 --> 01:07:28,040
The collective functionally knows all these things

1176
01:07:28,040 --> 01:07:30,760
because you can see it.

1177
01:07:30,760 --> 01:07:35,720
So we use the same kind of strategy

1178
01:07:35,720 --> 01:07:38,280
to address the issue of leg regeneration.

1179
01:07:38,280 --> 01:07:40,760
So frogs normally do not regenerate their legs,

1180
01:07:40,760 --> 01:07:41,960
unlike salamanders.

1181
01:07:41,960 --> 01:07:43,880
But what we can do is after amputation,

1182
01:07:43,880 --> 01:07:46,840
we can treat with a cocktail of ion channel drugs.

1183
01:07:46,840 --> 01:07:49,240
And in fact, they turn on immediately

1184
01:07:49,240 --> 01:07:51,000
these pro regenerative genes.

1185
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:52,040
They begin to make a leg.

1186
01:07:52,040 --> 01:07:52,920
You've got some toes.

1187
01:07:52,920 --> 01:07:55,640
By 45 days, you've already got a toenail and some toes.

1188
01:07:55,640 --> 01:07:57,560
Eventually, a very nice leg.

1189
01:07:57,560 --> 01:07:59,960
The leg is touch sensitive and motile.

1190
01:07:59,960 --> 01:08:03,880
And all of this happens from a brief modulation.

1191
01:08:03,880 --> 01:08:06,120
In fact, in the recent work on adult frogs,

1192
01:08:06,120 --> 01:08:09,240
we show that just one day, 24 hours of application

1193
01:08:09,240 --> 01:08:13,560
of our cocktail, you get a year and a half of leg growth.

1194
01:08:13,560 --> 01:08:14,920
So this is not 3D printing.

1195
01:08:14,920 --> 01:08:15,960
This is not scaffolds.

1196
01:08:15,960 --> 01:08:17,880
This is not us telling stem cells where to go

1197
01:08:17,880 --> 01:08:19,640
or what tissues go next to what tissues.

1198
01:08:19,640 --> 01:08:21,560
We have no idea how to build a frog leg.

1199
01:08:21,560 --> 01:08:24,040
It'll be a really long time before anybody

1200
01:08:24,040 --> 01:08:26,520
can micromanage that process, but you don't need to.

1201
01:08:26,520 --> 01:08:28,360
Because the cells already know how to do it.

1202
01:08:28,360 --> 01:08:29,880
What you do need to do is to convince them

1203
01:08:29,880 --> 01:08:31,880
that that's what they should do instead of scarring.

1204
01:08:31,880 --> 01:08:33,720
And that doesn't take very long.

1205
01:08:33,720 --> 01:08:35,320
24 hours is plenty.

1206
01:08:35,320 --> 01:08:36,760
And once they've decided that that's

1207
01:08:36,760 --> 01:08:38,680
where they're going in morphogenetic space,

1208
01:08:38,680 --> 01:08:39,880
they will keep going.

1209
01:08:39,880 --> 01:08:41,960
And this is how regenerative medicine

1210
01:08:41,960 --> 01:08:44,840
can take advantage of the competencies of these cells.

1211
01:08:44,920 --> 01:08:46,520
And here I should do a disclosure,

1212
01:08:46,520 --> 01:08:49,160
because David Kaplan and I are co-founders of a company

1213
01:08:49,160 --> 01:08:50,840
called Morphosuticals Inc.

1214
01:08:50,840 --> 01:08:53,000
And what we're trying to do is the same thing in rodents.

1215
01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:55,720
So David makes these amazing wearable bioreactors

1216
01:08:55,720 --> 01:08:59,160
that apply to the wound site, our drug payloads,

1217
01:08:59,160 --> 01:09:01,240
which are various things that attempt

1218
01:09:01,240 --> 01:09:03,720
to convince the cells that they should regenerate.

1219
01:09:03,720 --> 01:09:07,720
So hopefully, eventually, we'll be using this

1220
01:09:07,720 --> 01:09:08,840
in clinical practice.

1221
01:09:08,840 --> 01:09:11,400
For now, we've done it in frog.

1222
01:09:11,400 --> 01:09:14,120
We're currently trying to do it in mammals

1223
01:09:14,120 --> 01:09:16,760
and eventually, hopefully, in patients.

1224
01:09:16,760 --> 01:09:17,720
OK.

1225
01:09:17,720 --> 01:09:21,320
For the next story, I want to switch back to planarium.

1226
01:09:21,320 --> 01:09:23,480
So this kind of animal.

1227
01:09:23,480 --> 01:09:26,440
And I want to, at this point, make good on the promise

1228
01:09:26,440 --> 01:09:28,360
that I made about 10 minutes ago, which

1229
01:09:28,360 --> 01:09:32,040
is to show you how those gold states are actually encoded.

1230
01:09:32,040 --> 01:09:35,400
How does the tissue remember what a correct animal

1231
01:09:35,400 --> 01:09:36,280
should look like?

1232
01:09:36,280 --> 01:09:39,400
And the planaria are a great example of this,

1233
01:09:39,400 --> 01:09:41,800
because if you cut them into pieces,

1234
01:09:41,800 --> 01:09:45,960
and the record is something like 276, I believe,

1235
01:09:45,960 --> 01:09:48,520
each of these pieces regrows a perfect little worm.

1236
01:09:48,520 --> 01:09:51,080
They make exactly what's needed, no more, no less.

1237
01:09:51,080 --> 01:09:53,320
And in fact, it's a tough problem, because even

1238
01:09:53,320 --> 01:09:57,080
if you make just one cut here, these cells back here

1239
01:09:57,080 --> 01:09:58,360
have to make a tail.

1240
01:09:58,360 --> 01:10:00,200
These cells up here have to make a head,

1241
01:10:00,200 --> 01:10:01,720
but they were exact neighbors.

1242
01:10:01,720 --> 01:10:03,080
Right up until the time you cut them,

1243
01:10:03,080 --> 01:10:04,120
they were exact neighbors.

1244
01:10:04,120 --> 01:10:07,320
And yet they have radically different anatomical fates.

1245
01:10:07,320 --> 01:10:08,840
So you cannot decide if you're going

1246
01:10:08,840 --> 01:10:11,080
to be a head or a tail based on your position in the animal.

1247
01:10:11,080 --> 01:10:12,040
They have the same position.

1248
01:10:12,040 --> 01:10:13,160
You can cut anywhere.

1249
01:10:13,160 --> 01:10:15,800
It's after the cut, you have to now figure out,

1250
01:10:15,800 --> 01:10:16,520
what am I missing?

1251
01:10:16,520 --> 01:10:17,480
What do I still have?

1252
01:10:17,480 --> 01:10:20,200
And what does a correct planarian look like?

1253
01:10:20,200 --> 01:10:22,600
So oh, and by the way, these animals are also immoral.

1254
01:10:22,600 --> 01:10:24,800
In case you're interested in aging,

1255
01:10:24,800 --> 01:10:27,080
planaria are, they do not age.

1256
01:10:27,080 --> 01:10:28,600
There's no such thing as an old planarian,

1257
01:10:28,600 --> 01:10:32,120
because they continuously regenerate their tissues.

1258
01:10:32,120 --> 01:10:34,520
So we wanted to ask this simple question.

1259
01:10:34,520 --> 01:10:37,000
OK, here's our planarian.

1260
01:10:37,000 --> 01:10:39,200
And we amputate the head, and we amputate the tail.

1261
01:10:39,240 --> 01:10:41,200
So you have this middle fragment.

1262
01:10:41,200 --> 01:10:43,440
The middle fragment reliably regenerates

1263
01:10:43,440 --> 01:10:45,720
to have one head, one tail.

1264
01:10:45,720 --> 01:10:47,960
How does this piece know how many heads and tails

1265
01:10:47,960 --> 01:10:49,040
it's supposed to have?

1266
01:10:49,040 --> 01:10:52,480
So we investigated and found out that there's actually

1267
01:10:52,480 --> 01:10:54,720
an electrical circuit, which I don't have time to go into,

1268
01:10:54,720 --> 01:10:57,360
but there's an electrical circuit, which actually

1269
01:10:57,360 --> 01:10:59,520
encodes the number of heads that they're supposed to have.

1270
01:10:59,520 --> 01:11:03,760
And so what we were able to do then is this.

1271
01:11:03,760 --> 01:11:08,160
Here is a visualization of the normal electrical pattern

1272
01:11:08,160 --> 01:11:11,040
in these fragments, so one head, one tail.

1273
01:11:11,040 --> 01:11:13,720
But what you can do is you can rewrite that pattern

1274
01:11:13,720 --> 01:11:15,200
to say two heads.

1275
01:11:15,200 --> 01:11:16,920
Now, this is kind of messy still.

1276
01:11:16,920 --> 01:11:19,280
So the technology is still very much in development,

1277
01:11:19,280 --> 01:11:21,480
but you can already see, you can do that.

1278
01:11:21,480 --> 01:11:23,680
And when you do that to this animal,

1279
01:11:23,680 --> 01:11:26,120
they go ahead and they make a two-headed flatworm.

1280
01:11:26,120 --> 01:11:27,000
This is not Photoshop.

1281
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:29,680
These are real two-headed animals.

1282
01:11:29,680 --> 01:11:31,840
Notice something interesting.

1283
01:11:31,840 --> 01:11:35,120
So here's anatomically one head, one tail.

1284
01:11:35,120 --> 01:11:36,920
The gene expression for the head is, of course,

1285
01:11:36,960 --> 01:11:38,800
in the head and so on.

1286
01:11:38,800 --> 01:11:42,200
This animal, this bioelectrical map

1287
01:11:42,200 --> 01:11:43,760
is not a map of this two-headed guy.

1288
01:11:43,760 --> 01:11:47,480
This is a map of this perfectly normal, anatomically normal,

1289
01:11:47,480 --> 01:11:48,680
one-headed animal.

1290
01:11:48,680 --> 01:11:50,640
Not only is his anatomy still normal,

1291
01:11:50,640 --> 01:11:53,480
his molecular biology is still normal.

1292
01:11:53,480 --> 01:11:56,760
The anterior marker is still only on in the head,

1293
01:11:56,760 --> 01:11:58,280
not in the tail.

1294
01:11:58,280 --> 01:12:01,200
So, and yet, if you were to cut them,

1295
01:12:01,200 --> 01:12:03,280
they go on and to make two-headed flatworms.

1296
01:12:03,320 --> 01:12:06,920
So let me pause here and just explain,

1297
01:12:06,920 --> 01:12:08,680
to underline what's going on here.

1298
01:12:09,680 --> 01:12:12,840
This bioelectrical pattern is what I promised before

1299
01:12:12,840 --> 01:12:16,920
as a readout of where the information

1300
01:12:16,920 --> 01:12:18,480
for the target morphology,

1301
01:12:18,480 --> 01:12:21,080
the target, the correct pattern to build,

1302
01:12:21,080 --> 01:12:22,280
this is where it's stored.

1303
01:12:22,280 --> 01:12:25,200
It is literally stored in this electrical map,

1304
01:12:25,200 --> 01:12:27,640
the way that memories are thought to be stored

1305
01:12:27,640 --> 01:12:28,960
in the brain.

1306
01:12:28,960 --> 01:12:32,480
Also, a single normal planarian body

1307
01:12:32,480 --> 01:12:36,120
is able to store one of two different ideas

1308
01:12:36,120 --> 01:12:38,640
about what a correct planarian should look like.

1309
01:12:38,640 --> 01:12:39,520
In other words, this again,

1310
01:12:39,520 --> 01:12:41,000
sounds very much like the nervous system

1311
01:12:41,000 --> 01:12:43,160
where the exact same hardware, your brain,

1312
01:12:43,160 --> 01:12:46,360
can store many, many different types of ideas,

1313
01:12:46,360 --> 01:12:48,160
and you do not have to genetically edit your brain

1314
01:12:48,160 --> 01:12:51,000
to have it store different types of information.

1315
01:12:51,000 --> 01:12:53,600
It's just built to have different targets

1316
01:12:53,600 --> 01:12:55,600
that it can remember.

1317
01:12:55,600 --> 01:12:58,800
And so, and the third amazing thing about this is that

1318
01:12:58,800 --> 01:13:01,920
this pattern memory is a kind of counterfactual,

1319
01:13:01,920 --> 01:13:05,880
meaning that this is a memory of what I am going to do

1320
01:13:05,880 --> 01:13:07,880
if I get injured in the future.

1321
01:13:07,880 --> 01:13:09,080
It's not what I'm doing now.

1322
01:13:09,080 --> 01:13:11,480
It's what I will do if at some point in the future

1323
01:13:11,480 --> 01:13:12,360
I get injured.

1324
01:13:12,360 --> 01:13:16,080
So that ability to, it's a very primitive version

1325
01:13:16,080 --> 01:13:18,040
of what's sort of magical about brains,

1326
01:13:18,040 --> 01:13:20,680
which is this ability to mental time travel,

1327
01:13:20,680 --> 01:13:23,720
to think about, to have memories of things

1328
01:13:23,720 --> 01:13:25,880
that happened long ago and are not true now,

1329
01:13:25,880 --> 01:13:27,360
and to have anticipation of things

1330
01:13:27,360 --> 01:13:28,440
that might happen in the future

1331
01:13:28,440 --> 01:13:29,920
that are also not happening now.

1332
01:13:29,920 --> 01:13:32,080
People think that this is very much

1333
01:13:32,080 --> 01:13:33,880
the kind of thing that brains do and it is,

1334
01:13:33,880 --> 01:13:37,200
but the evolutionary precursors of that are ancient,

1335
01:13:37,200 --> 01:13:40,560
and even the planarian morphological intelligence

1336
01:13:40,560 --> 01:13:44,560
has a degree of ability to do this kind of mental time travel.

1337
01:13:44,560 --> 01:13:46,440
Now, why do I keep calling it a memory?

1338
01:13:46,440 --> 01:13:50,940
Because if you take these two-headed worms,

1339
01:13:52,320 --> 01:13:53,880
and you cut them again in plain water,

1340
01:13:53,880 --> 01:13:56,800
no more manipulation of any kind,

1341
01:13:56,800 --> 01:13:59,400
they continue to form two-headed animals.

1342
01:13:59,440 --> 01:14:01,600
So no genetic change.

1343
01:14:01,600 --> 01:14:02,680
The hardware is untouched.

1344
01:14:02,680 --> 01:14:04,800
These, the genomes here are exactly the same.

1345
01:14:04,800 --> 01:14:06,160
We haven't done any genomic editing,

1346
01:14:06,160 --> 01:14:07,800
nothing wrong with their genomes.

1347
01:14:07,800 --> 01:14:10,560
And yet this is a permanent line of animals

1348
01:14:10,560 --> 01:14:14,640
that will continue to generate two-headed creatures,

1349
01:14:14,640 --> 01:14:17,240
even though they have the normal wild-type genome.

1350
01:14:17,240 --> 01:14:20,440
So the question of where is,

1351
01:14:20,440 --> 01:14:22,200
remember that slide I showed at the beginning,

1352
01:14:22,200 --> 01:14:23,960
that human torso, and I asked,

1353
01:14:23,960 --> 01:14:25,560
where is that information stored?

1354
01:14:26,640 --> 01:14:28,200
Where is the information stored

1355
01:14:28,200 --> 01:14:30,840
for the number of heads a worm should have?

1356
01:14:30,840 --> 01:14:31,760
It isn't genetic,

1357
01:14:31,760 --> 01:14:34,840
because you can take the exact same genetic hardware

1358
01:14:34,840 --> 01:14:36,760
and have it be two-headed.

1359
01:14:36,760 --> 01:14:38,480
But what the genome does do

1360
01:14:38,480 --> 01:14:41,080
is to build an electrical circuit

1361
01:14:41,080 --> 01:14:44,480
that by default stores the information for one head,

1362
01:14:44,480 --> 01:14:46,320
but it can be pushed to other fates,

1363
01:14:46,320 --> 01:14:48,960
for example, to store information for two heads.

1364
01:14:48,960 --> 01:14:50,120
So this is why I call it memory.

1365
01:14:50,120 --> 01:14:51,800
It's long-term stable.

1366
01:14:51,800 --> 01:14:53,720
It's rewritable, and we can also, by the way,

1367
01:14:53,720 --> 01:14:56,480
take two-headed and put them back to one-headed.

1368
01:14:56,480 --> 01:14:57,640
And it has this latency,

1369
01:14:57,640 --> 01:14:59,360
which I just showed you, this conditional recall.

1370
01:14:59,360 --> 01:15:02,600
It doesn't kick in until you've injured the animal.

1371
01:15:02,600 --> 01:15:03,440
And so here you can see,

1372
01:15:03,440 --> 01:15:06,920
this is a video of these two-headed critters

1373
01:15:06,920 --> 01:15:08,600
doing their thing.

1374
01:15:08,600 --> 01:15:10,640
Okay, and so what we're doing now

1375
01:15:10,640 --> 01:15:15,640
is lots of computational modeling,

1376
01:15:16,680 --> 01:15:18,800
and actually using lots of ideas

1377
01:15:18,800 --> 01:15:21,960
from connectionist machine learning

1378
01:15:21,960 --> 01:15:23,480
to try and understand specifically

1379
01:15:23,480 --> 01:15:25,880
how the electrical circuits that are in these planaria

1380
01:15:25,880 --> 01:15:30,040
can store different types of target patterns

1381
01:15:30,040 --> 01:15:31,520
and reconstruct those patterns

1382
01:15:31,520 --> 01:15:34,080
even when the information has been damaged.

1383
01:15:34,080 --> 01:15:39,080
Now, I've shown you this story about two heads and so on.

1384
01:15:39,160 --> 01:15:41,440
It's not just about the number of heads.

1385
01:15:41,440 --> 01:15:43,240
One other amazing thing you can do

1386
01:15:43,240 --> 01:15:47,920
is push them to make heads of different species.

1387
01:15:47,920 --> 01:15:50,520
So here is a planarian with a nice triangular head

1388
01:15:50,520 --> 01:15:52,720
that's appropriate to his species.

1389
01:15:52,720 --> 01:15:53,920
We can cut off that head,

1390
01:15:53,960 --> 01:15:56,120
perturb the electrical network topology,

1391
01:15:56,120 --> 01:15:57,440
let them settle back down.

1392
01:15:57,440 --> 01:15:59,440
And when they regenerate their heads,

1393
01:15:59,440 --> 01:16:00,760
sometimes they make the normal head,

1394
01:16:00,760 --> 01:16:02,200
but sometimes they make round heads

1395
01:16:02,200 --> 01:16:03,640
like this S-Mediterranean.

1396
01:16:03,640 --> 01:16:06,560
Sometimes they make flat heads like this Pifelina.

1397
01:16:06,560 --> 01:16:07,800
Again, no genetic change here.

1398
01:16:07,800 --> 01:16:09,880
This has nothing to do with rewiring the hardware.

1399
01:16:09,880 --> 01:16:12,200
What it is is pushing that same machine

1400
01:16:12,200 --> 01:16:15,440
into other attractors in that enormous space

1401
01:16:15,440 --> 01:16:18,280
of morphogenetic configurations

1402
01:16:18,280 --> 01:16:19,680
that they're able to traverse.

1403
01:16:19,680 --> 01:16:20,840
They're normally very good

1404
01:16:20,840 --> 01:16:22,760
at going exactly where they need to go,

1405
01:16:22,760 --> 01:16:25,920
but they can in fact visit other regions of that state space

1406
01:16:25,920 --> 01:16:27,720
that normally belong to other species.

1407
01:16:27,720 --> 01:16:28,640
And not just the head shape,

1408
01:16:28,640 --> 01:16:31,640
but also the shape of the brain,

1409
01:16:31,640 --> 01:16:33,080
the distribution of stem cells,

1410
01:16:33,080 --> 01:16:34,440
just like these other species,

1411
01:16:34,440 --> 01:16:38,000
150 to 100 million years distance.

1412
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:41,200
So again, this notion of reprogrammable biological hardware,

1413
01:16:41,200 --> 01:16:43,440
they can do other things beyond the default

1414
01:16:43,440 --> 01:16:44,800
that they normally do.

1415
01:16:44,800 --> 01:16:46,960
And by the way, they can go even further

1416
01:16:46,960 --> 01:16:50,560
into the latent morphospace of a typical planarian

1417
01:16:50,560 --> 01:16:53,360
and Darcy Thompson as early as 1917,

1418
01:16:53,360 --> 01:16:55,960
he had this notion of living beings

1419
01:16:55,960 --> 01:17:00,240
exploring various kinds of mathematical morphospace.

1420
01:17:00,240 --> 01:17:02,800
You can make them go further than a typical planarian

1421
01:17:02,800 --> 01:17:05,720
and you can make these things that are sort of,

1422
01:17:05,720 --> 01:17:06,840
they're not flat anymore.

1423
01:17:06,840 --> 01:17:08,360
They're round and cylindrical

1424
01:17:08,360 --> 01:17:09,480
and they're sort of hybrid shapes

1425
01:17:09,480 --> 01:17:11,720
or these crazy spiky things.

1426
01:17:11,720 --> 01:17:13,840
These wild type cells are capable

1427
01:17:13,840 --> 01:17:15,840
of building lots of different stuff.

1428
01:17:15,840 --> 01:17:19,200
And so what we're doing now is really trying

1429
01:17:19,200 --> 01:17:21,400
to make these full stack computational models

1430
01:17:21,400 --> 01:17:24,360
that go all the way from the lowest level molecular details

1431
01:17:24,360 --> 01:17:27,200
of which genes are turned on and off.

1432
01:17:27,200 --> 01:17:32,200
And then build the models of the bioelectric states,

1433
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:37,560
the cellular and tissue-wide bioelectric states

1434
01:17:37,560 --> 01:17:39,080
that result from these ion channels

1435
01:17:39,080 --> 01:17:44,080
and eventually all the way up to body-wide decisions

1436
01:17:44,400 --> 01:17:46,120
and algorithms, which is what you need

1437
01:17:46,120 --> 01:17:47,520
for that anatomical compiler

1438
01:17:47,520 --> 01:17:48,920
that I talked about at the beginning,

1439
01:17:48,960 --> 01:17:50,320
which is to understand how the tissue

1440
01:17:50,320 --> 01:17:51,680
is actually making decisions

1441
01:17:51,680 --> 01:17:53,800
about large scale shape, number of heads,

1442
01:17:53,800 --> 01:17:55,560
type of heads and so on.

1443
01:17:55,560 --> 01:17:57,880
Okay, so just a couple more minutes

1444
01:17:57,880 --> 01:17:59,040
and then we'll take another break.

1445
01:17:59,040 --> 01:18:00,920
I just, the last thing I wanna show you here

1446
01:18:00,920 --> 01:18:05,920
is a biomedical intervention that emerges

1447
01:18:06,920 --> 01:18:08,680
from this kind of approach.

1448
01:18:08,680 --> 01:18:11,400
And it has to do with fixing frog brains.

1449
01:18:11,400 --> 01:18:13,000
So here's a normal tadpole brain,

1450
01:18:13,000 --> 01:18:14,520
here's the forebrain, here's the midbrain,

1451
01:18:14,520 --> 01:18:16,880
here's the hindbrain, this is the normal structure.

1452
01:18:16,880 --> 01:18:21,320
And if you expose these guys to various teratogens

1453
01:18:21,320 --> 01:18:25,200
like nicotine, what you'll see is alcohol, nicotine,

1454
01:18:25,200 --> 01:18:26,040
lots of different things.

1455
01:18:26,040 --> 01:18:29,720
What you'll see is that a real defect in brain formation,

1456
01:18:29,720 --> 01:18:31,080
the eyes are connected to the brain,

1457
01:18:31,080 --> 01:18:33,200
the forebrain is basically missing,

1458
01:18:33,200 --> 01:18:34,880
lots of problems here.

1459
01:18:34,880 --> 01:18:35,840
And so we wanted to know,

1460
01:18:35,840 --> 01:18:37,440
well, how would you fix something like this?

1461
01:18:37,440 --> 01:18:39,720
It's very complex, we don't wanna try to tell

1462
01:18:39,720 --> 01:18:41,880
every cell what to do, how do we fix this?

1463
01:18:41,880 --> 01:18:46,880
And so Alexis Pytak, who's a member

1464
01:18:47,240 --> 01:18:48,280
of our Allen Discovery Center,

1465
01:18:48,280 --> 01:18:50,640
made this computational model.

1466
01:18:50,640 --> 01:18:55,240
And with FiveHalfPy, who's a staff scientist in the group,

1467
01:18:55,240 --> 01:18:56,480
they simply asked the question,

1468
01:18:56,480 --> 01:19:00,100
what underlies the bioelectric gradients

1469
01:19:00,100 --> 01:19:02,840
that normally tell the cells how big and normal,

1470
01:19:02,840 --> 01:19:04,880
and what shape a normal brain should be?

1471
01:19:04,880 --> 01:19:06,640
And so when you have a model like this,

1472
01:19:06,640 --> 01:19:08,680
you can ask it questions and you can say,

1473
01:19:08,680 --> 01:19:10,680
well, if the pattern is incorrect,

1474
01:19:10,720 --> 01:19:12,880
what would we have to do to make it correct?

1475
01:19:12,880 --> 01:19:16,920
And so the model gave us an answer.

1476
01:19:16,920 --> 01:19:19,960
It said, well, there's this particular channel called HCN2.

1477
01:19:19,960 --> 01:19:21,640
And if you were to open that up,

1478
01:19:21,640 --> 01:19:23,520
it would be, the pattern would be restored

1479
01:19:23,520 --> 01:19:24,640
and the cells would know what to do.

1480
01:19:24,640 --> 01:19:26,200
And so here's an example,

1481
01:19:26,200 --> 01:19:29,640
and this is actually a much more difficult case

1482
01:19:29,640 --> 01:19:31,760
than that teratogen case I showed you.

1483
01:19:31,760 --> 01:19:33,580
This is a notch mutation.

1484
01:19:33,580 --> 01:19:37,800
So notch is a really critical neurogenesis gene

1485
01:19:37,800 --> 01:19:38,720
in the absence of notch.

1486
01:19:38,720 --> 01:19:39,800
You can see the brain is,

1487
01:19:39,800 --> 01:19:41,600
the forebrain is gone, the midbrain and hindbrain

1488
01:19:41,600 --> 01:19:42,780
are a big bubble full of water.

1489
01:19:42,780 --> 01:19:45,400
I mean, these animals are profoundly affected.

1490
01:19:45,400 --> 01:19:48,160
But even though that notch mutation is there,

1491
01:19:48,160 --> 01:19:51,320
if you force the cells to have the correct bioelectrical

1492
01:19:51,320 --> 01:19:53,520
pattern by using the strategy given to us

1493
01:19:53,520 --> 01:19:56,320
by the computational model, the brain becomes normal.

1494
01:19:56,320 --> 01:20:00,000
So they get their shape of the brain back,

1495
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:01,000
they get gene expression back,

1496
01:20:01,000 --> 01:20:02,520
and they get their IQs back.

1497
01:20:04,200 --> 01:20:07,160
Their learning rates are indistinguishable from controls.

1498
01:20:07,160 --> 01:20:08,920
So this is an amazing example

1499
01:20:08,920 --> 01:20:13,920
of not only instructively repairing complex defects

1500
01:20:15,520 --> 01:20:16,800
using this bioelectrical approach,

1501
01:20:16,800 --> 01:20:20,440
but specifically fixing a hardware defect in software.

1502
01:20:20,440 --> 01:20:21,480
And I'm not saying that's gonna work

1503
01:20:21,480 --> 01:20:23,920
for all genetic defects.

1504
01:20:23,920 --> 01:20:25,120
There are many things that bioelectrics

1505
01:20:25,120 --> 01:20:26,280
are not gonna work for,

1506
01:20:26,280 --> 01:20:28,360
but it's again, this idea of plasticity.

1507
01:20:28,360 --> 01:20:32,760
The idea is that broken hardware is not the end of the line,

1508
01:20:32,760 --> 01:20:34,160
that if the algorithm is good,

1509
01:20:34,160 --> 01:20:36,480
which for example, in Plenary, it's absolutely amazing,

1510
01:20:36,480 --> 01:20:37,640
if the algorithm is good,

1511
01:20:37,640 --> 01:20:39,560
you can often get around these defects

1512
01:20:39,560 --> 01:20:41,560
and still get to where you need to go

1513
01:20:41,560 --> 01:20:43,640
if you can remember what the correct pattern is.

1514
01:20:43,640 --> 01:20:48,240
And so the biomedical roadmap looks roughly like this.

1515
01:20:48,240 --> 01:20:50,160
We're making this sort of turnkey system

1516
01:20:51,160 --> 01:20:53,600
where, and you can sort of play with parts of it

1517
01:20:53,600 --> 01:20:55,480
or already online,

1518
01:20:55,480 --> 01:20:59,240
where you know what the incorrect pattern currently is,

1519
01:20:59,240 --> 01:21:02,400
you should know what the correct pattern is,

1520
01:21:02,400 --> 01:21:04,640
and this is something that we're still working on

1521
01:21:04,640 --> 01:21:06,760
to acquire these physiomic data sets.

1522
01:21:06,760 --> 01:21:09,200
And then the model can actually tell you

1523
01:21:09,200 --> 01:21:11,920
which channels and pumps to trigger,

1524
01:21:11,920 --> 01:21:14,600
so how to communicate your anatomical goals

1525
01:21:14,600 --> 01:21:16,200
to that set of cells.

1526
01:21:16,200 --> 01:21:18,160
And then of course, once you know which channels,

1527
01:21:18,160 --> 01:21:21,560
then it's pretty easy to pick drugs that you already know.

1528
01:21:21,560 --> 01:21:26,160
So looking forward,

1529
01:21:26,160 --> 01:21:29,320
the impact on biomedicine

1530
01:21:29,320 --> 01:21:31,760
is to complement all of this,

1531
01:21:31,760 --> 01:21:35,160
all of these current kind of technologies,

1532
01:21:35,160 --> 01:21:38,600
so surgery, transplants, stem cells, genomic editing,

1533
01:21:38,600 --> 01:21:41,080
rewriting, gene regulatory networks,

1534
01:21:42,360 --> 01:21:45,120
molecular drugs that target proteins and so on.

1535
01:21:45,120 --> 01:21:46,560
All of these things are bottom up,

1536
01:21:46,560 --> 01:21:47,480
they're micromanagement,

1537
01:21:47,480 --> 01:21:48,920
they're targeting the pathways

1538
01:21:48,920 --> 01:21:51,000
to exactly do what you need to do.

1539
01:21:51,000 --> 01:21:52,000
You can complement that

1540
01:21:52,000 --> 01:21:54,760
by taking advantage of the tissue intelligence.

1541
01:21:54,760 --> 01:21:56,400
And so we've talked about,

1542
01:21:56,400 --> 01:21:57,240
in this part of the talk,

1543
01:21:57,240 --> 01:21:58,600
we've talked about many examples

1544
01:21:58,600 --> 01:22:00,920
of cells and tissues solving problems.

1545
01:22:00,920 --> 01:22:05,080
They can find new ways to deal with physiological challenges,

1546
01:22:05,080 --> 01:22:07,760
to with anatomical challenges,

1547
01:22:07,760 --> 01:22:09,160
and with gene expression challenges.

1548
01:22:09,160 --> 01:22:11,160
So they have various competencies,

1549
01:22:11,160 --> 01:22:13,840
they can recruit neighbors as needed,

1550
01:22:13,840 --> 01:22:17,400
they can find different paths to the same outcome.

1551
01:22:17,400 --> 01:22:21,640
And if we can sort of take advantage of all those subroutines

1552
01:22:21,640 --> 01:22:23,840
through either cell training or tissue training

1553
01:22:23,840 --> 01:22:26,440
or various kinds of other triggers,

1554
01:22:26,440 --> 01:22:27,920
which we call morphosuticals

1555
01:22:27,920 --> 01:22:30,280
and the subset of electrosuticals,

1556
01:22:30,280 --> 01:22:31,720
then I think,

1557
01:22:31,720 --> 01:22:33,120
and you can find all the details here,

1558
01:22:33,120 --> 01:22:35,880
really transformative types of regenerative medicine

1559
01:22:35,880 --> 01:22:36,720
are gonna be available.

1560
01:22:36,720 --> 01:22:39,240
And I think that overall,

1561
01:22:40,040 --> 01:22:42,360
and possibly surprising nobody who works

1562
01:22:42,360 --> 01:22:47,360
in these sorts of traditional alternative medicine modalities,

1563
01:22:48,240 --> 01:22:49,840
the future of this approach

1564
01:22:49,840 --> 01:22:53,080
is gonna look a lot more like a kind of somatic psychiatry

1565
01:22:53,080 --> 01:22:54,400
than it is like chemistry.

1566
01:22:54,400 --> 01:22:57,880
Because bioelectricity is that interface layer

1567
01:22:57,880 --> 01:23:00,480
that enables top-down controls,

1568
01:23:00,480 --> 01:23:02,840
in other words, memories of global patterns

1569
01:23:02,840 --> 01:23:04,320
in various spaces,

1570
01:23:04,320 --> 01:23:07,400
to filter down to the molecular machinery

1571
01:23:07,400 --> 01:23:09,200
that actually activates them.

1572
01:23:09,200 --> 01:23:12,520
And so that's something that's really quite unique

1573
01:23:12,520 --> 01:23:13,840
to this bioelectrical layer.

1574
01:23:13,840 --> 01:23:15,960
And it's not just some, this is important to mention,

1575
01:23:15,960 --> 01:23:18,080
it's not just some rare thing that works

1576
01:23:18,080 --> 01:23:23,080
in the case of hypnodermatology and mind body medicine

1577
01:23:23,760 --> 01:23:26,960
and weird altered states and biofeedback.

1578
01:23:26,960 --> 01:23:29,560
It works 24-7 in your body.

1579
01:23:29,560 --> 01:23:31,480
When you decide in the morning,

1580
01:23:31,480 --> 01:23:33,400
you wake up and you decide that you're going to work,

1581
01:23:33,400 --> 01:23:37,840
that high-level cognitive intent

1582
01:23:37,840 --> 01:23:39,200
of what you want to do

1583
01:23:39,200 --> 01:23:41,000
has to depolarize your muscle cells

1584
01:23:41,000 --> 01:23:42,680
for you to be able to get out of bed.

1585
01:23:42,680 --> 01:23:46,000
So voluntary behavior is already showing you

1586
01:23:46,000 --> 01:23:47,200
this mind-body connection,

1587
01:23:47,200 --> 01:23:50,320
this idea that these high-level executive cognitive goals

1588
01:23:50,920 --> 01:23:52,600
have to eventually trickle down

1589
01:23:52,600 --> 01:23:54,520
to control molecular events in your muscles

1590
01:23:54,520 --> 01:23:55,360
and in your glands.

1591
01:23:55,360 --> 01:23:58,520
So this is the way our bodies work as a multi-scale system

1592
01:23:58,520 --> 01:24:01,600
all the way from high-level cognitive structures

1593
01:24:01,600 --> 01:24:03,880
down to the molecular pathways.

1594
01:24:03,880 --> 01:24:07,080
And bioelectricity is the layer that does that.

1595
01:24:07,080 --> 01:24:09,560
So I'm going to call a break now.

1596
01:24:09,560 --> 01:24:12,320
Let's take a couple of minutes.

1597
01:24:12,320 --> 01:24:14,160
Everybody gets some water.

1598
01:24:14,160 --> 01:24:15,520
I'm going to be back in about three minutes

1599
01:24:15,520 --> 01:24:17,760
and then people can ask questions.

1600
01:24:18,760 --> 01:24:20,760
But take a break for a few here.

1601
01:24:20,760 --> 01:24:21,840
All right, I'm back.

1602
01:24:21,840 --> 01:24:24,000
If anybody wants to start asking questions.

1603
01:24:25,400 --> 01:24:28,840
Yes, I can see Matthew's got his hand up already.

1604
01:24:31,440 --> 01:24:32,800
Great, thank you.

1605
01:24:34,760 --> 01:24:36,400
Hey, Michael, thanks so much for this

1606
01:24:37,640 --> 01:24:40,360
really astonishing research that you're doing.

1607
01:24:40,360 --> 01:24:42,200
This is wonderful to listen to.

1608
01:24:44,400 --> 01:24:45,680
I know you're a scientist,

1609
01:24:45,960 --> 01:24:49,080
but I think you're also verging

1610
01:24:49,080 --> 01:24:51,760
on some deep philosophical questions here.

1611
01:24:51,760 --> 01:24:55,880
And so I want to ask you if you think that the work

1612
01:24:55,880 --> 01:25:00,000
that you're doing, showing the work

1613
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:01,600
that these bioelectric fields do,

1614
01:25:01,600 --> 01:25:04,480
it's obviously challenging a certain kind of reductionism.

1615
01:25:06,200 --> 01:25:09,240
But do you think there's a new philosophy of nature

1616
01:25:10,520 --> 01:25:14,960
opening up as you push the frontiers of biological science?

1617
01:25:14,960 --> 01:25:17,760
And what I mean here is, particularly,

1618
01:25:17,760 --> 01:25:21,280
to give an example on the question of memory,

1619
01:25:22,920 --> 01:25:26,920
it seems to me that the distributed memory

1620
01:25:26,920 --> 01:25:31,920
that you're finding in multicellular organisms

1621
01:25:32,320 --> 01:25:34,840
seems to suggest something more along the lines

1622
01:25:34,840 --> 01:25:36,440
of the philosophy of nature

1623
01:25:36,440 --> 01:25:41,440
that Bergson or Whitehead would suggest

1624
01:25:41,440 --> 01:25:45,040
where memory is not as the scientific materialist

1625
01:25:45,040 --> 01:25:46,640
philosophy of nature would suggest something

1626
01:25:46,640 --> 01:25:50,520
that's memory could only be something stored

1627
01:25:50,520 --> 01:25:51,960
through some material trace.

1628
01:25:53,280 --> 01:25:55,280
What Bergson, Whitehead and other thinkers

1629
01:25:55,280 --> 01:26:00,280
in that vein would say is that to understand memory

1630
01:26:01,440 --> 01:26:05,840
or consciousness, you really need to see nature

1631
01:26:05,840 --> 01:26:10,840
as this process of what Whitehead would call accumulation

1632
01:26:11,120 --> 01:26:14,800
so that the past is inherited in the present

1633
01:26:17,600 --> 01:26:22,320
and it's still present, the past is present in other words,

1634
01:26:22,320 --> 01:26:24,120
it's not gone, it's not somewhere else,

1635
01:26:24,120 --> 01:26:27,640
it doesn't need to be recorded on some material medium

1636
01:26:27,640 --> 01:26:30,280
necessarily, though of course traces are left

1637
01:26:30,280 --> 01:26:33,240
as nature accumulates in this process of growth.

1638
01:26:34,400 --> 01:26:37,400
And so it seems to me that memory therefore becomes something

1639
01:26:37,400 --> 01:26:39,800
that if we're gonna talk about how or where is it stored,

1640
01:26:40,520 --> 01:26:43,120
it's stored everywhere, not only in the organism

1641
01:26:43,120 --> 01:26:45,920
within the skin boundary of the organism

1642
01:26:45,920 --> 01:26:48,240
but the whole environment is in some sense

1643
01:26:48,240 --> 01:26:51,240
storing the memory if we wanna think of it that way.

1644
01:26:51,240 --> 01:26:53,680
You take the organism out of its environment,

1645
01:26:53,680 --> 01:26:57,240
is it really gonna be able to produce the form

1646
01:26:57,240 --> 01:27:00,720
that we would think it's remembering,

1647
01:27:00,720 --> 01:27:03,400
because it depends on all this environmental context

1648
01:27:03,400 --> 01:27:04,720
to do what it does.

1649
01:27:04,720 --> 01:27:07,040
And so yeah, that's one example of what a new philosophy

1650
01:27:07,040 --> 01:27:08,800
of nature might suggest as regards to memory

1651
01:27:08,800 --> 01:27:11,720
but how do you see your work venturing

1652
01:27:11,720 --> 01:27:14,960
into these deeper philosophical questions?

1653
01:27:14,960 --> 01:27:19,960
Yeah, so let's say this, I think that the right way

1654
01:27:20,840 --> 01:27:25,840
to think about the relationship between the experiments

1655
01:27:26,000 --> 01:27:29,960
and all of that and these different philosophical takes

1656
01:27:29,960 --> 01:27:33,800
is as a set of, so my framework you can in fact,

1657
01:27:33,800 --> 01:27:36,080
you can see it here, it's called the TAME,

1658
01:27:36,120 --> 01:27:40,240
technological approach to mind everywhere.

1659
01:27:40,240 --> 01:27:43,440
And the reason that I emphasize technological

1660
01:27:43,440 --> 01:27:48,440
is that I want the philosophical concepts

1661
01:27:48,480 --> 01:27:50,840
to be testable and to do specific work.

1662
01:27:50,840 --> 01:27:54,440
In other words, what I am looking for

1663
01:27:54,440 --> 01:27:57,560
is for different lenses or different ways

1664
01:27:57,560 --> 01:28:02,160
of looking at these phenomena that facilitate progress.

1665
01:28:02,160 --> 01:28:07,160
So a philosophical worldview is to me is useful

1666
01:28:07,320 --> 01:28:10,680
to the extent that it can be applied to the things we do

1667
01:28:10,680 --> 01:28:12,700
to drive new discoveries, new capabilities

1668
01:28:12,700 --> 01:28:14,720
to drive a research program basically.

1669
01:28:14,720 --> 01:28:18,720
So the reality is I've borrowed in order to make all

1670
01:28:18,720 --> 01:28:22,840
of these kind of new findings and that my lab has found

1671
01:28:24,200 --> 01:28:27,480
these were done because we borrowed from all kinds

1672
01:28:27,480 --> 01:28:29,760
of unusual ways of thinking about the world

1673
01:28:29,760 --> 01:28:32,000
that are not standard in the field.

1674
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:35,800
And so to that extent, I do think we absolutely interface

1675
01:28:35,800 --> 01:28:39,400
with interesting different philosophical views

1676
01:28:39,400 --> 01:28:42,000
be they, you know, Berberxen or whoever else.

1677
01:28:42,840 --> 01:28:46,120
But that's it for, that's what I'm looking for.

1678
01:28:46,120 --> 01:28:50,240
So for example, on the specific example that you mentioned,

1679
01:28:50,240 --> 01:28:52,920
if you say that memory is sort of everywhere,

1680
01:28:52,920 --> 01:28:57,160
that's fine, I suspect that has a lot of value to it.

1681
01:28:57,160 --> 01:28:59,120
The next question is, okay, how do we turn that

1682
01:28:59,120 --> 01:29:04,120
into a specific intervention that shows us to be able

1683
01:29:04,120 --> 01:29:05,360
to do something that you could not do

1684
01:29:05,360 --> 01:29:07,000
if you didn't have that worldview.

1685
01:29:07,000 --> 01:29:10,480
So that's where the rubber has to meet the road

1686
01:29:10,480 --> 01:29:15,480
in terms of facilitating experimental advances

1687
01:29:15,640 --> 01:29:19,080
and finding new research.

1688
01:29:19,080 --> 01:29:22,040
So I think that's a longer, we can have a whole other

1689
01:29:22,040 --> 01:29:24,600
discussion about where I've borrowed a lot of this stuff

1690
01:29:24,600 --> 01:29:28,000
from because it is interesting, but everything to me,

1691
01:29:28,040 --> 01:29:31,640
everything has to eventually interface strongly

1692
01:29:31,640 --> 01:29:33,840
with the research enterprise.

1693
01:29:37,800 --> 01:29:38,640
Thank you.

1694
01:29:38,640 --> 01:29:39,480
Let's do one more.

1695
01:29:42,360 --> 01:29:44,680
Don't see any hands up yet,

1696
01:29:44,680 --> 01:29:47,600
but also given the time to be, we can carry on.

1697
01:29:47,600 --> 01:29:50,160
Yeah, let's keep going and then I'll do the last part

1698
01:29:50,160 --> 01:29:53,440
and then we can talk about whatever people want at the end.

1699
01:29:53,440 --> 01:29:57,800
Okay, so in this final part, I wanna come back to,

1700
01:29:58,640 --> 01:29:59,800
so let's remember where we were.

1701
01:29:59,800 --> 01:30:03,680
We started out acknowledging this kind of multi-scale

1702
01:30:03,680 --> 01:30:07,800
architecture of the body and trying to widen this idea

1703
01:30:07,800 --> 01:30:11,760
of intelligence towards a continuum of competency

1704
01:30:11,760 --> 01:30:13,560
from very simple kinds of things,

1705
01:30:13,560 --> 01:30:17,180
too much more complex things in diverse problem spaces.

1706
01:30:17,180 --> 01:30:20,160
And so, and then we went through some very specific

1707
01:30:20,160 --> 01:30:24,200
examples of bioelectricity as a kind of cognitive glue

1708
01:30:24,200 --> 01:30:28,200
that holds together these competent components,

1709
01:30:28,200 --> 01:30:31,000
for example, cells and allows the collective to solve

1710
01:30:31,000 --> 01:30:32,920
problems in morphogenetic space

1711
01:30:32,920 --> 01:30:35,280
and the implications for biomedicine.

1712
01:30:35,280 --> 01:30:38,600
I wanna circle back kind of to a somewhat more

1713
01:30:38,600 --> 01:30:42,400
philosophical aspect to really start to dig into

1714
01:30:42,400 --> 01:30:45,640
what does it mean to be an agent or a self

1715
01:30:45,640 --> 01:30:49,080
and how does it work that components are able

1716
01:30:49,080 --> 01:30:51,720
to make these emergent cells?

1717
01:30:51,720 --> 01:30:54,180
And then I wanna show you some novel organisms

1718
01:30:54,180 --> 01:30:57,580
as a kind of tool with which to explore this latent space

1719
01:30:57,580 --> 01:30:59,380
that I've been hinting at.

1720
01:30:59,380 --> 01:31:02,140
So, here we go.

1721
01:31:04,180 --> 01:31:07,420
Remember back to the original kind of goal

1722
01:31:07,420 --> 01:31:11,340
for this framework was to be able to think about

1723
01:31:11,340 --> 01:31:15,980
very diverse kinds of agents all in the same space.

1724
01:31:15,980 --> 01:31:19,980
So how do we think about synthetic beings

1725
01:31:19,980 --> 01:31:23,140
and possible aliens and cells and tissues and humans

1726
01:31:23,980 --> 01:31:27,420
and birds and everything else kind of on the same,

1727
01:31:27,420 --> 01:31:28,620
using the same framework.

1728
01:31:28,620 --> 01:31:30,980
And so, and so what I come up with was this notion

1729
01:31:30,980 --> 01:31:32,660
of a cognitive light cone.

1730
01:31:32,660 --> 01:31:34,420
So cognitive light cone, which is shown here

1731
01:31:34,420 --> 01:31:37,540
and this is kind of a, if anybody's into physics

1732
01:31:37,540 --> 01:31:39,540
you'll recognize this is a kind of upside down

1733
01:31:39,540 --> 01:31:43,100
Mankowski cone where space, all the three dimensions

1734
01:31:43,100 --> 01:31:45,180
of space are collapsed onto this axis

1735
01:31:45,180 --> 01:31:47,220
and time is on this axis.

1736
01:31:47,220 --> 01:31:50,380
And what the cognitive light cone is,

1737
01:31:50,580 --> 01:31:54,660
is simply the size of the largest goal

1738
01:31:54,660 --> 01:31:56,620
that a given system can work towards.

1739
01:31:56,620 --> 01:31:58,620
So not how far away can it sense

1740
01:31:58,620 --> 01:32:00,100
or how far away can it act,

1741
01:32:00,100 --> 01:32:03,420
but the size of the largest goal state that it can pursue.

1742
01:32:03,420 --> 01:32:06,260
So if all you care about is the local concentration

1743
01:32:06,260 --> 01:32:08,460
of sucrose, then maybe you're a bacterium

1744
01:32:08,460 --> 01:32:10,500
and you've got a tiny little cognitive light cone

1745
01:32:10,500 --> 01:32:11,740
that has a tiny bit of memory

1746
01:32:11,740 --> 01:32:13,700
from what the concentration was 20 minutes ago,

1747
01:32:13,700 --> 01:32:16,700
a little bit of predictive capacity and that's it.

1748
01:32:16,700 --> 01:32:19,940
If you are something like a dog,

1749
01:32:19,940 --> 01:32:22,100
well, you have a lot more memory going backwards,

1750
01:32:22,100 --> 01:32:23,980
more predictive power going forwards.

1751
01:32:23,980 --> 01:32:26,140
You have the ability to have the goal

1752
01:32:26,140 --> 01:32:28,780
of let's say protecting the whole sort of property.

1753
01:32:28,780 --> 01:32:30,780
So you have some idea of the size of a yard

1754
01:32:30,780 --> 01:32:32,140
and what's going on,

1755
01:32:32,140 --> 01:32:34,660
but you're never going to care about what happens

1756
01:32:34,660 --> 01:32:37,420
three times, three towns over a month from now.

1757
01:32:37,420 --> 01:32:39,660
It's just that that's too far in the future

1758
01:32:39,660 --> 01:32:42,420
and also in space for that cognitive, as far as we know

1759
01:32:42,420 --> 01:32:45,340
for that cognitive system to have any of that as a goal.

1760
01:32:45,340 --> 01:32:47,740
If you're a human, you could have an absolutely enormous

1761
01:32:47,740 --> 01:32:50,820
light cone where you might be working towards world peace

1762
01:32:50,820 --> 01:32:52,100
over the next hundred years

1763
01:32:52,100 --> 01:32:54,260
and you could have these very large light cones.

1764
01:32:54,260 --> 01:32:56,940
And by the way, you have the added psychological pressure

1765
01:32:56,940 --> 01:32:59,500
of knowing for a fact that some of your goals

1766
01:32:59,500 --> 01:33:01,980
are not achievable in your lifetime

1767
01:33:01,980 --> 01:33:03,820
because your cognitive light cone is bigger

1768
01:33:03,820 --> 01:33:08,580
than your actual survival, your possible survival.

1769
01:33:08,580 --> 01:33:10,420
So if you're a goldfish, you don't have that problem.

1770
01:33:10,420 --> 01:33:14,900
All your goals are achievable in your lifetime

1771
01:33:14,900 --> 01:33:17,940
because they're all very kind of short path.

1772
01:33:17,940 --> 01:33:22,140
And of course, as maybe it was Beth or somebody had pointed out

1773
01:33:22,140 --> 01:33:25,620
that we are of course compound intelligences

1774
01:33:25,620 --> 01:33:27,140
because we are made of components

1775
01:33:27,140 --> 01:33:28,940
with their own little cognitive light cones

1776
01:33:28,940 --> 01:33:30,180
in their own spaces.

1777
01:33:30,180 --> 01:33:34,820
So we are this huge patchwork of compound intelligences

1778
01:33:34,820 --> 01:33:38,220
all of which see different worlds in different spaces

1779
01:33:38,220 --> 01:33:40,580
and are all cooperating and competing and so on

1780
01:33:40,580 --> 01:33:42,620
both across and within levels.

1781
01:33:42,620 --> 01:33:44,140
So with this notion,

1782
01:33:44,180 --> 01:33:45,540
let's think about a few things.

1783
01:33:45,540 --> 01:33:48,300
First of all, let's go back to this idea

1784
01:33:48,300 --> 01:33:49,780
of a collective intelligence.

1785
01:33:49,780 --> 01:33:54,780
So if somebody shows you a human brain,

1786
01:33:55,260 --> 01:33:57,900
if you didn't already know what a human look like

1787
01:33:57,900 --> 01:33:58,980
and maybe even if you did

1788
01:33:58,980 --> 01:34:00,500
because it's not an obvious question

1789
01:34:00,500 --> 01:34:03,100
and somebody asks you, how many individuals are in there?

1790
01:34:03,100 --> 01:34:05,100
How many selves are in there?

1791
01:34:05,100 --> 01:34:08,660
And it leads to the fact that we do not know actually

1792
01:34:08,660 --> 01:34:10,900
how much brain matter it takes

1793
01:34:10,900 --> 01:34:13,260
to support a single human self.

1794
01:34:13,260 --> 01:34:15,340
I mean, we see the normal case,

1795
01:34:15,340 --> 01:34:18,340
but this leads to people saying things like,

1796
01:34:18,340 --> 01:34:20,540
wow, with such a, for a B or something like that

1797
01:34:20,540 --> 01:34:22,500
with such a tiny brain, it does a,

1798
01:34:22,500 --> 01:34:26,620
well, we don't know how much it takes to be a single self.

1799
01:34:26,620 --> 01:34:28,740
We don't have any way of guessing what that's gonna be

1800
01:34:28,740 --> 01:34:30,580
until you already know what a human is.

1801
01:34:30,580 --> 01:34:32,460
So let's look at this example.

1802
01:34:32,460 --> 01:34:36,020
This is a schematic of an early blastoderm

1803
01:34:36,020 --> 01:34:40,260
of an amniote embryo, let's say it's a bird or a human.

1804
01:34:40,260 --> 01:34:41,660
And what you see is a bunch of cells.

1805
01:34:41,660 --> 01:34:44,420
There's 50,000 cells and we look at that

1806
01:34:44,420 --> 01:34:46,620
and we say, oh, there's an embryo.

1807
01:34:46,620 --> 01:34:48,220
Now, what are we counting when we say

1808
01:34:48,220 --> 01:34:49,460
there's one embryo there?

1809
01:34:49,460 --> 01:34:50,900
What is there one of?

1810
01:34:50,900 --> 01:34:52,740
There are tens of thousands of cells.

1811
01:34:52,740 --> 01:34:53,940
What is there one of?

1812
01:34:53,940 --> 01:34:56,380
What we're actually counting is alignment.

1813
01:34:56,380 --> 01:34:58,380
We're counting the fact that all of these,

1814
01:34:58,380 --> 01:35:00,100
and that alignment is literal

1815
01:35:00,100 --> 01:35:02,180
because the cells physically have to align with each other

1816
01:35:02,180 --> 01:35:04,800
and also alignment in morphogenetic space

1817
01:35:04,800 --> 01:35:07,100
because all of these cells normally

1818
01:35:07,100 --> 01:35:10,060
are going to work together to build one individual.

1819
01:35:10,060 --> 01:35:11,940
They have one particular large scale pattern

1820
01:35:11,940 --> 01:35:12,940
that they're all going to build

1821
01:35:12,940 --> 01:35:15,300
and that is what we're counting as one.

1822
01:35:15,300 --> 01:35:18,660
And now, could you guess in advance

1823
01:35:18,660 --> 01:35:20,540
how many embryos there are

1824
01:35:20,540 --> 01:35:23,020
or how many individuals are in this brain?

1825
01:35:23,020 --> 01:35:25,020
It's a very similar as I was saying before

1826
01:35:25,020 --> 01:35:27,740
with the Turing, the kind of allusion to Turing.

1827
01:35:27,740 --> 01:35:29,700
It's a very similar problem.

1828
01:35:29,700 --> 01:35:31,900
Can you tell how many are going to be in there?

1829
01:35:31,900 --> 01:35:34,040
Is it genetically specified how many are in there?

1830
01:35:34,040 --> 01:35:35,700
Well, the answer is it is not.

1831
01:35:35,700 --> 01:35:39,940
So here's an experiment that Lutz first did

1832
01:35:39,940 --> 01:35:42,220
in the 40s and I used to do as a grad student

1833
01:35:42,220 --> 01:35:43,860
in the duck embryo.

1834
01:35:43,860 --> 01:35:46,060
So what you can do is you can take a little needle

1835
01:35:46,060 --> 01:35:48,860
and you can put some scratches in this blastoderm.

1836
01:35:48,860 --> 01:35:50,120
And so what happens is that once you,

1837
01:35:50,120 --> 01:35:51,980
when you made those little scratches

1838
01:35:51,980 --> 01:35:53,700
until they heal up, which they will,

1839
01:35:53,700 --> 01:35:56,400
but until they heal up, every region

1840
01:35:56,400 --> 01:35:59,360
which does not feel the presence of these other regions

1841
01:35:59,360 --> 01:36:00,220
becomes an embryo.

1842
01:36:00,220 --> 01:36:03,200
It self-organizes an embryo and then it heals.

1843
01:36:03,200 --> 01:36:05,640
And then what you have is multiple areas

1844
01:36:05,640 --> 01:36:07,980
that are conjoined twins or triplets.

1845
01:36:07,980 --> 01:36:09,420
And then in between them,

1846
01:36:09,420 --> 01:36:11,660
you have these little weird little disputed zones

1847
01:36:11,660 --> 01:36:13,820
where these cells can't quite tell who they belong to,

1848
01:36:13,820 --> 01:36:15,220
but in the end they have to make a decision

1849
01:36:15,220 --> 01:36:17,220
and they become part of this or part of that.

1850
01:36:17,220 --> 01:36:21,500
And this is really, there are a couple

1851
01:36:21,500 --> 01:36:22,340
of interesting things here.

1852
01:36:22,340 --> 01:36:24,260
First of all, because of this,

1853
01:36:24,260 --> 01:36:28,500
because you can split this up into some number of islands,

1854
01:36:28,500 --> 01:36:31,580
the number of cells, just imagine this is a human embryo,

1855
01:36:31,580 --> 01:36:35,020
the number of individuals in there is not fixed.

1856
01:36:35,020 --> 01:36:37,380
It is not determined by the genetics.

1857
01:36:37,380 --> 01:36:40,820
It is set in real time by the physiology.

1858
01:36:40,820 --> 01:36:43,060
It could be zero, it could be one, it could be two,

1859
01:36:43,060 --> 01:36:45,860
it could be some number of embryos,

1860
01:36:45,860 --> 01:36:47,700
probably up to half a dozen, let's say.

1861
01:36:48,780 --> 01:36:53,780
And it's very important for the making of cells

1862
01:36:55,140 --> 01:36:57,340
that they are self-organized,

1863
01:36:57,340 --> 01:36:58,580
meaning that they don't know,

1864
01:36:58,580 --> 01:37:00,780
each cell does not know where it,

1865
01:37:00,780 --> 01:37:05,080
where every cell is some other cells external environment.

1866
01:37:05,080 --> 01:37:07,680
So where do I end and my neighbor begins?

1867
01:37:07,680 --> 01:37:10,720
Or where do I end and the outside world begins?

1868
01:37:10,720 --> 01:37:11,960
This is something that is not true

1869
01:37:11,960 --> 01:37:15,920
for almost any current AI or robotic system,

1870
01:37:15,920 --> 01:37:17,920
because they don't have to put themselves together

1871
01:37:17,920 --> 01:37:19,880
from scratch, they are told right from the beginning,

1872
01:37:19,880 --> 01:37:20,720
they're programmed to say,

1873
01:37:20,720 --> 01:37:22,080
this is your border, here are the inputs,

1874
01:37:22,080 --> 01:37:23,920
here are the outputs, you are here,

1875
01:37:23,920 --> 01:37:25,200
the outside world is there.

1876
01:37:25,200 --> 01:37:26,920
That is not the case for living beings.

1877
01:37:26,920 --> 01:37:30,720
We have to self-construct and we do not know right away

1878
01:37:30,720 --> 01:37:32,840
where our borders are, how many of us are in there

1879
01:37:32,840 --> 01:37:33,680
and so on.

1880
01:37:34,680 --> 01:37:37,080
This also taking it back to the brain, of course,

1881
01:37:37,080 --> 01:37:39,200
is this issue of individuation,

1882
01:37:39,200 --> 01:37:41,880
because in split brain patients

1883
01:37:41,880 --> 01:37:43,680
and dissociative disorders and so on,

1884
01:37:43,680 --> 01:37:46,840
you find out that there actually are more than one self

1885
01:37:46,840 --> 01:37:48,520
within a standard human brain,

1886
01:37:48,520 --> 01:37:50,800
how many could fit in there, we do not know,

1887
01:37:50,800 --> 01:37:54,320
but the record for these dissociative kind of cases,

1888
01:37:54,320 --> 01:37:57,120
I mean, I think I've read in the 60s,

1889
01:37:57,120 --> 01:37:59,360
60 different personalities that could be in there.

1890
01:37:59,440 --> 01:38:03,840
So this idea of an active medium,

1891
01:38:03,840 --> 01:38:06,960
an excitable medium that differentiates

1892
01:38:06,960 --> 01:38:11,960
into a number of coherent selves is really key.

1893
01:38:12,680 --> 01:38:15,240
And so now you have to start asking yourself, okay,

1894
01:38:15,240 --> 01:38:19,680
so as we are self-constructing out of this,

1895
01:38:19,680 --> 01:38:22,960
sort of this Freudian ocean of possibility,

1896
01:38:22,960 --> 01:38:25,480
some out of 20 or 50,000 cells,

1897
01:38:25,480 --> 01:38:27,680
three or two or one embryo will form,

1898
01:38:28,520 --> 01:38:33,120
what are the dynamics that actually allow individual cells

1899
01:38:33,120 --> 01:38:34,960
with their own tiny little goals,

1900
01:38:34,960 --> 01:38:36,080
what are the goals of cells?

1901
01:38:36,080 --> 01:38:38,000
Well, every cell wants to become two cells

1902
01:38:38,000 --> 01:38:39,440
and they have metabolic goals

1903
01:38:39,440 --> 01:38:40,760
that they try to meet and so on.

1904
01:38:40,760 --> 01:38:42,800
What allows them to scale up

1905
01:38:42,800 --> 01:38:47,800
to work towards very sort of a large complex goals

1906
01:38:48,680 --> 01:38:49,760
like building a whole embryo?

1907
01:38:49,760 --> 01:38:50,600
I mean, that's huge.

1908
01:38:50,600 --> 01:38:52,760
No individual cell can know what a whole embryo is,

1909
01:38:52,760 --> 01:38:53,880
but the collective does.

1910
01:38:53,880 --> 01:38:55,320
So what allows that?

1911
01:38:55,320 --> 01:38:56,440
Well, here are some hypotheses.

1912
01:38:56,440 --> 01:38:58,680
One thing that allows it, I think,

1913
01:38:58,680 --> 01:39:00,960
is the kind of memory wiping that happens

1914
01:39:00,960 --> 01:39:03,040
when cells are electrically connected.

1915
01:39:03,040 --> 01:39:04,760
Because when two cells signal each other

1916
01:39:04,760 --> 01:39:05,600
the old-fashioned way,

1917
01:39:05,600 --> 01:39:07,720
where they just sort of secrete a chemical molecule

1918
01:39:07,720 --> 01:39:09,680
and it comes over here and the cell senses it,

1919
01:39:09,680 --> 01:39:11,240
it's very easy for this cell to know

1920
01:39:11,240 --> 01:39:13,720
whether that signal came from the outside or not.

1921
01:39:13,720 --> 01:39:14,680
So they can maintain,

1922
01:39:14,680 --> 01:39:16,680
these two cells can maintain their individuality

1923
01:39:16,680 --> 01:39:18,400
and they can maintain different memories

1924
01:39:18,400 --> 01:39:19,920
and the cell can ignore the signal

1925
01:39:19,920 --> 01:39:22,320
or do something about it, whatever.

1926
01:39:22,320 --> 01:39:24,040
But there's something magic

1927
01:39:24,040 --> 01:39:25,560
about these electrical gap junctions.

1928
01:39:25,560 --> 01:39:28,600
When the cells are joined by these gap junctions,

1929
01:39:28,600 --> 01:39:32,360
this signal, let's say it's a calcium spike

1930
01:39:32,360 --> 01:39:33,200
from being injured.

1931
01:39:33,200 --> 01:39:34,600
This cell got poked with something

1932
01:39:34,600 --> 01:39:37,440
and this calcium spike is a trace of that event,

1933
01:39:37,440 --> 01:39:39,320
a kind of a memory n-gram of that event.

1934
01:39:39,320 --> 01:39:42,080
It will immediately propagate through these gap junctions

1935
01:39:42,080 --> 01:39:45,480
and that the interpretation of that signal for this cell

1936
01:39:47,440 --> 01:39:49,840
is exactly the same as it would before

1937
01:39:49,840 --> 01:39:51,400
its own calcium spike.

1938
01:39:51,400 --> 01:39:53,440
Calcium doesn't have any metadata on it

1939
01:39:53,440 --> 01:39:54,960
that says, where did you come from?

1940
01:39:55,000 --> 01:39:56,640
So by moving through this,

1941
01:39:56,640 --> 01:39:58,520
there's a kind of memory,

1942
01:39:58,520 --> 01:40:00,800
kind of identity wipe that happens

1943
01:40:00,800 --> 01:40:03,080
where this cell now has that same memory trace.

1944
01:40:03,080 --> 01:40:04,320
And as far as it's concerned,

1945
01:40:04,320 --> 01:40:05,800
that's its own natural memory.

1946
01:40:05,800 --> 01:40:08,280
It has no way of knowing that's a false memory.

1947
01:40:08,280 --> 01:40:10,240
So to this cell, that's a false memory,

1948
01:40:10,240 --> 01:40:11,560
but to the collective,

1949
01:40:11,560 --> 01:40:14,840
it is an absolutely true memory that the collective had.

1950
01:40:14,840 --> 01:40:17,000
So that kind of wiping property,

1951
01:40:17,000 --> 01:40:19,160
it strips ownership information.

1952
01:40:19,160 --> 01:40:22,320
It makes it very hard for each cell

1953
01:40:22,320 --> 01:40:24,320
to maintain an individual identity

1954
01:40:24,320 --> 01:40:26,040
with respect to what its history was.

1955
01:40:26,040 --> 01:40:28,640
And it makes collectives out of individual cells.

1956
01:40:28,640 --> 01:40:30,760
And of course it makes them bigger.

1957
01:40:30,760 --> 01:40:32,760
So my memory become our memories,

1958
01:40:32,760 --> 01:40:35,040
my stress state becomes our stress

1959
01:40:35,040 --> 01:40:37,000
and my goal becomes our goal.

1960
01:40:37,000 --> 01:40:41,040
And so by when a single cell in this diagram,

1961
01:40:41,040 --> 01:40:44,240
when a single cell has some size of a cognitive light going

1962
01:40:44,240 --> 01:40:46,800
and some ability to anticipate and remember,

1963
01:40:46,800 --> 01:40:51,800
a network of these cells has a bigger computational capacity

1964
01:40:52,320 --> 01:40:54,840
and a bigger spatial sensorium.

1965
01:40:54,840 --> 01:40:57,440
And it can actually have larger scale,

1966
01:40:57,440 --> 01:41:00,360
more complex states as set points.

1967
01:41:00,360 --> 01:41:02,320
And now you can start to see how a collection of cells

1968
01:41:02,320 --> 01:41:04,320
could actually work on something like building an arm

1969
01:41:04,320 --> 01:41:06,000
or building a whole body.

1970
01:41:06,000 --> 01:41:07,240
And so we can imagine,

1971
01:41:07,240 --> 01:41:08,360
and so we're doing this now

1972
01:41:08,360 --> 01:41:12,240
is doing these very specific computational models

1973
01:41:12,240 --> 01:41:15,760
of how little tiny homeostatic loops like this,

1974
01:41:15,760 --> 01:41:19,160
for example, measure the pH and act

1975
01:41:19,160 --> 01:41:21,920
become very large homeostatic loops

1976
01:41:21,920 --> 01:41:23,280
about something completely different.

1977
01:41:23,280 --> 01:41:25,960
Single cells cannot remember anything like this,

1978
01:41:25,960 --> 01:41:28,840
but a giant collection of cells could.

1979
01:41:28,840 --> 01:41:30,720
And so this is a very active area of research

1980
01:41:30,720 --> 01:41:33,760
is to figure out exactly how that scales up.

1981
01:41:33,760 --> 01:41:36,760
The implications are these,

1982
01:41:36,760 --> 01:41:38,240
here's what evolution has done.

1983
01:41:38,240 --> 01:41:41,200
Evolution has enabled single cells to work together

1984
01:41:41,200 --> 01:41:43,320
to enlarge their cognitive light cones

1985
01:41:43,320 --> 01:41:47,240
where the goals scale from the very humble goals

1986
01:41:47,280 --> 01:41:51,040
of single cells to the more grandiose goals of collectives

1987
01:41:51,040 --> 01:41:52,960
where they can work on something gigantic

1988
01:41:52,960 --> 01:41:54,640
like making sure you have four fingers.

1989
01:41:54,640 --> 01:41:56,560
This cell doesn't know anything about what a finger is,

1990
01:41:56,560 --> 01:41:58,440
but this collective does.

1991
01:41:58,440 --> 01:42:00,080
So evolution gave us the scale up,

1992
01:42:00,080 --> 01:42:01,800
but there's a failure mode to this.

1993
01:42:01,800 --> 01:42:03,200
The failure mode is cancer.

1994
01:42:03,200 --> 01:42:06,520
So here's where when these cells

1995
01:42:06,520 --> 01:42:08,880
are electrically isolated from each other,

1996
01:42:08,880 --> 01:42:12,080
this is human glioblastoma in culture.

1997
01:42:12,080 --> 01:42:14,000
So these individual cells can roll back

1998
01:42:14,000 --> 01:42:16,760
to their unicellular past.

1999
01:42:16,760 --> 01:42:18,360
They do not become more selfish.

2000
01:42:18,360 --> 01:42:20,800
A lot of game theory kind of approaches

2001
01:42:20,800 --> 01:42:22,800
treat cancer cells as more selfish.

2002
01:42:22,800 --> 01:42:24,120
They don't become more selfish.

2003
01:42:24,120 --> 01:42:25,760
Their cells get smaller.

2004
01:42:25,760 --> 01:42:26,600
They're just a selfish.

2005
01:42:26,600 --> 01:42:28,440
It's just that the self here is huge.

2006
01:42:28,440 --> 01:42:32,040
Their self is very tiny and they do the best they can.

2007
01:42:32,040 --> 01:42:36,360
But biometically, if you have that kind of weird perspective

2008
01:42:36,360 --> 01:42:39,920
on cancer as a disorder of selfhood,

2009
01:42:39,920 --> 01:42:42,320
then what you can do is something interesting.

2010
01:42:42,320 --> 01:42:44,720
And we did this years ago.

2011
01:42:45,720 --> 01:42:48,880
You can induce tumors using human oncogenes,

2012
01:42:48,880 --> 01:42:50,720
but what you can do is use these ion channels

2013
01:42:50,720 --> 01:42:53,440
to force the cells to be in the correct electrical state

2014
01:42:53,440 --> 01:42:55,520
to maintain proper communication.

2015
01:42:55,520 --> 01:42:57,920
And when you do that, even though the oncogene is blazingly

2016
01:42:57,920 --> 01:42:59,200
expressed, it's labeled in red here.

2017
01:42:59,200 --> 01:43:00,760
You can see it's all over the place.

2018
01:43:00,760 --> 01:43:01,440
There's no tumor.

2019
01:43:01,440 --> 01:43:02,640
This is the same animal.

2020
01:43:02,640 --> 01:43:06,280
There's no tumor because the genetics might have a defect.

2021
01:43:06,280 --> 01:43:08,080
The hardware might be a little bit broken.

2022
01:43:08,080 --> 01:43:10,520
But as long as the cell is physiologically

2023
01:43:10,520 --> 01:43:13,520
part of this network that contains large scale

2024
01:43:13,520 --> 01:43:16,720
goals like building nice skin, nice muscle, and so on,

2025
01:43:16,720 --> 01:43:18,760
they're kept away from tumorogenesis

2026
01:43:18,760 --> 01:43:22,880
and harness towards these large scale anatomical goals.

2027
01:43:22,880 --> 01:43:27,800
So the last piece I want to show you, it goes beyond this.

2028
01:43:27,800 --> 01:43:30,640
So we've been talking about goals in different spaces.

2029
01:43:30,640 --> 01:43:33,760
So the tiny metabolic goals of single cells,

2030
01:43:33,760 --> 01:43:37,560
the morphogenetic goals of cellular collectives.

2031
01:43:37,560 --> 01:43:40,680
And now we can ask the following question.

2032
01:43:40,680 --> 01:43:42,360
Where do these goals come from?

2033
01:43:42,360 --> 01:43:45,760
And what other goals can novel beings have?

2034
01:43:45,760 --> 01:43:47,480
And so this is a project that I also

2035
01:43:47,480 --> 01:43:51,040
have to do a disclosure here because Josh Bongard and I

2036
01:43:51,040 --> 01:43:53,200
have another company called Fauna Systems, which is all

2037
01:43:53,200 --> 01:43:56,520
about AI-designed biorebotics.

2038
01:43:56,520 --> 01:43:59,280
And this is all work done in collaboration

2039
01:43:59,280 --> 01:44:02,680
with a Bongard lab at this Institute of Computationally

2040
01:44:02,680 --> 01:44:04,520
Designed Organisms.

2041
01:44:04,520 --> 01:44:08,120
We asked the following question, how much plasticity

2042
01:44:08,120 --> 01:44:09,000
do these cells have?

2043
01:44:09,000 --> 01:44:11,040
And when they're liberated from their normal boundary

2044
01:44:11,040 --> 01:44:14,040
conditions of the animal, what will they do?

2045
01:44:14,040 --> 01:44:15,920
How will they reboot multicellularity?

2046
01:44:15,920 --> 01:44:19,120
How will they navigate anatomical and behavioral spaces?

2047
01:44:19,120 --> 01:44:20,160
What can they do?

2048
01:44:20,160 --> 01:44:22,240
So here's the experiment.

2049
01:44:22,240 --> 01:44:24,720
And all the biology here was done by Douglas Blackest

2050
01:44:24,720 --> 01:44:26,280
and the staff scientists in the group.

2051
01:44:26,280 --> 01:44:28,520
What we did was we took an early frog embryo.

2052
01:44:28,520 --> 01:44:33,480
And at this stage, where they have about 1,000 cells or so,

2053
01:44:33,480 --> 01:44:39,000
we cut off these cells up here, which are the skin.

2054
01:44:39,000 --> 01:44:41,960
This is all faded to be skin cells.

2055
01:44:41,960 --> 01:44:45,920
And we dissociated them and we put them back

2056
01:44:45,920 --> 01:44:48,000
in this little depression here.

2057
01:44:48,000 --> 01:44:49,560
And so they're just skin.

2058
01:44:49,560 --> 01:44:50,080
There's no nerve.

2059
01:44:50,080 --> 01:44:51,800
There's no muscle, just skin.

2060
01:44:51,800 --> 01:44:53,600
And what could they have done?

2061
01:44:53,600 --> 01:44:54,680
Well, they could have died.

2062
01:44:54,680 --> 01:44:58,240
They could have spread out and gotten away from each other.

2063
01:44:58,240 --> 01:45:00,240
They could have formed a nice two-dimensional monolayer,

2064
01:45:00,240 --> 01:45:01,680
the way that cell culture does.

2065
01:45:01,680 --> 01:45:04,280
What they did instead was something quite different.

2066
01:45:04,280 --> 01:45:05,800
Oops.

2067
01:45:06,240 --> 01:45:09,200
What they did instead, after we put them

2068
01:45:09,200 --> 01:45:11,680
in this little depression, all these little skin cells,

2069
01:45:11,680 --> 01:45:16,120
they got together and they formed this round thing

2070
01:45:16,120 --> 01:45:17,960
we call a xenobot.

2071
01:45:17,960 --> 01:45:19,880
It's called a xenobot because Xenopus lavus

2072
01:45:19,880 --> 01:45:20,720
is the name of the frog.

2073
01:45:20,720 --> 01:45:23,520
And we think it's a biorebotics platform, so xenobot.

2074
01:45:23,520 --> 01:45:25,680
What they do is these little guys

2075
01:45:25,680 --> 01:45:30,200
achieve spontaneous motion by using their cilia.

2076
01:45:30,200 --> 01:45:32,280
So frog skin has little hairs, little,

2077
01:45:32,280 --> 01:45:33,720
motile hairs called cilia, which it

2078
01:45:33,760 --> 01:45:36,600
uses to distribute mucus down the side of the animal.

2079
01:45:36,600 --> 01:45:39,360
So instead, what they do is they use it to row against the water.

2080
01:45:39,360 --> 01:45:40,520
So they start to swim.

2081
01:45:40,520 --> 01:45:41,600
So they can go in circles.

2082
01:45:41,600 --> 01:45:46,320
They can patrol back and forth like this.

2083
01:45:46,320 --> 01:45:47,880
They can have these collective behaviors

2084
01:45:47,880 --> 01:45:49,240
where they can go on a long journey

2085
01:45:49,240 --> 01:45:50,760
or they can interact with each other

2086
01:45:50,760 --> 01:45:53,960
or they can sit there doing nothing.

2087
01:45:53,960 --> 01:45:55,880
They have all kinds of behaviors.

2088
01:45:55,880 --> 01:46:00,080
Here's one moving in a maze in water.

2089
01:46:00,080 --> 01:46:01,800
So you'll see what it does as it goes.

2090
01:46:01,840 --> 01:46:04,080
It takes the corner without bumping into anything.

2091
01:46:04,080 --> 01:46:06,680
And then at this point, it spontaneously decides to turn around

2092
01:46:06,680 --> 01:46:07,960
and go back where it came from.

2093
01:46:07,960 --> 01:46:09,000
We are not pacing it.

2094
01:46:09,000 --> 01:46:10,200
We are not controlling it.

2095
01:46:10,200 --> 01:46:12,280
There are no, there's no neurons here.

2096
01:46:12,280 --> 01:46:17,160
This is a piece of skin living its own, its new best life.

2097
01:46:17,160 --> 01:46:21,400
And you're watching some of its behaviors.

2098
01:46:21,400 --> 01:46:26,560
It has all kinds of active calcium signaling.

2099
01:46:26,560 --> 01:46:30,360
This is the same technology used to read out brain signaling.

2100
01:46:30,440 --> 01:46:32,800
We are currently in the process of trying to decode all this

2101
01:46:32,800 --> 01:46:34,720
to see what the cells are saying to each other.

2102
01:46:34,720 --> 01:46:36,720
What are these two, what if anything

2103
01:46:36,720 --> 01:46:38,920
are these two Xenobots saying to each other?

2104
01:46:38,920 --> 01:46:40,120
They can regenerate.

2105
01:46:40,120 --> 01:46:42,720
So if you cut them almost in half, they will seal up.

2106
01:46:42,720 --> 01:46:43,560
So look at this.

2107
01:46:43,560 --> 01:46:45,680
So here's like 180 degree hinge right there.

2108
01:46:45,680 --> 01:46:48,720
Look at the power it takes to fold itself back

2109
01:46:48,720 --> 01:46:51,040
into its new Xenobot shape.

2110
01:46:51,040 --> 01:46:53,640
And something else that's amazing is by modeling.

2111
01:46:53,640 --> 01:46:57,320
And so Josh Bongard and Sam Kriegman in his lab

2112
01:46:57,320 --> 01:46:58,960
did a bunch of computational modeling

2113
01:46:59,000 --> 01:47:01,520
in the simulator of these bots running around.

2114
01:47:01,520 --> 01:47:04,280
And they noticed a kind of unusual predicted behavior

2115
01:47:04,280 --> 01:47:07,240
that they tend to rearrange their environment

2116
01:47:07,240 --> 01:47:08,080
in this weird way.

2117
01:47:08,080 --> 01:47:10,560
So they went, so we went ahead and we built some of the ones.

2118
01:47:10,560 --> 01:47:13,400
Then again, Doug sculpted some of these things

2119
01:47:13,400 --> 01:47:15,320
in ways that the AI suggested.

2120
01:47:15,320 --> 01:47:17,800
And we discovered something remarkable,

2121
01:47:17,800 --> 01:47:19,960
which is called kinematic replication.

2122
01:47:21,360 --> 01:47:24,480
Notice that we've made it impossible for these animals

2123
01:47:24,480 --> 01:47:26,760
to reproduce in the normal froggy fashion.

2124
01:47:26,760 --> 01:47:27,920
They don't have any other things there.

2125
01:47:27,920 --> 01:47:29,080
They're just skin.

2126
01:47:29,080 --> 01:47:31,880
But within a couple of days,

2127
01:47:31,880 --> 01:47:35,920
they discover a novel way of making copies of themselves

2128
01:47:35,920 --> 01:47:37,560
that's basically Von Neumann's dream.

2129
01:47:37,560 --> 01:47:40,480
It's able to construct copies of itself

2130
01:47:40,480 --> 01:47:42,680
from material it finds in the environment.

2131
01:47:42,680 --> 01:47:45,680
So this white stuff here, these are all loose skin cells

2132
01:47:45,680 --> 01:47:47,800
that we sprinkled into their world.

2133
01:47:47,800 --> 01:47:49,120
What they do is they run around

2134
01:47:49,120 --> 01:47:52,240
and they both collectively and individually,

2135
01:47:52,240 --> 01:47:54,480
they collect them into little balls

2136
01:47:54,480 --> 01:47:56,440
and then they sort of polish these little balls

2137
01:47:56,440 --> 01:47:57,800
and compact them.

2138
01:47:57,800 --> 01:48:00,840
And because they're not working with a passive,

2139
01:48:00,840 --> 01:48:02,560
some kind of passive particle,

2140
01:48:02,560 --> 01:48:04,920
they're working with an agential material,

2141
01:48:04,920 --> 01:48:07,160
just like we were the engineers,

2142
01:48:07,160 --> 01:48:09,400
Doug Blackison was working with an agential material,

2143
01:48:09,400 --> 01:48:10,880
these cells that have an agenda,

2144
01:48:10,880 --> 01:48:13,160
they like to assemble into the xenobot.

2145
01:48:13,160 --> 01:48:17,200
These little blobs become the next generation of xenobots.

2146
01:48:17,200 --> 01:48:18,040
And guess what they do?

2147
01:48:18,040 --> 01:48:19,360
They run around and collect more cells

2148
01:48:19,360 --> 01:48:23,240
and they become the next generation of xenobots and so on.

2149
01:48:23,240 --> 01:48:26,640
And so this ability to make copies of itself

2150
01:48:26,640 --> 01:48:28,760
using kinematic replication is just one of them.

2151
01:48:28,760 --> 01:48:31,480
We're just scratching the surface here of what they can do.

2152
01:48:31,480 --> 01:48:34,040
There is much, much more coming.

2153
01:48:34,040 --> 01:48:39,040
And so this suggests an interesting set of questions.

2154
01:48:40,040 --> 01:48:45,040
What did the frog genome actually learn during evolution?

2155
01:48:45,200 --> 01:48:46,680
Well, it can make frogs, sure,

2156
01:48:46,680 --> 01:48:48,880
and this is the normal tadpole path,

2157
01:48:48,880 --> 01:48:49,920
but it turns out,

2158
01:48:49,920 --> 01:48:51,480
and something we would have never known

2159
01:48:51,480 --> 01:48:53,840
if we hadn't tried this experiment,

2160
01:48:53,840 --> 01:48:55,280
it actually can do other things.

2161
01:48:55,280 --> 01:48:57,400
It can make the exact same genome.

2162
01:48:57,400 --> 01:48:59,240
We didn't edit the genome here.

2163
01:48:59,240 --> 01:49:01,480
We didn't give them any weird new nanomaterials.

2164
01:49:02,560 --> 01:49:05,840
The same genome can have a different developmental path.

2165
01:49:05,840 --> 01:49:07,880
This is what an old xenobot looks like.

2166
01:49:07,880 --> 01:49:11,680
I mean, it has this weird structure

2167
01:49:11,680 --> 01:49:13,400
that who knows what it's changing into.

2168
01:49:13,400 --> 01:49:14,920
And then it has different behaviors

2169
01:49:14,920 --> 01:49:17,600
that's different from what tadpoles do.

2170
01:49:17,600 --> 01:49:19,360
So here's some interesting things about it.

2171
01:49:19,360 --> 01:49:22,400
First of all, for any other creature,

2172
01:49:22,400 --> 01:49:25,560
when you ask why does it look the way it looks?

2173
01:49:25,560 --> 01:49:28,360
Why does it have certain behaviors and properties?

2174
01:49:28,360 --> 01:49:30,160
The answer is always the same, well, evolution.

2175
01:49:30,160 --> 01:49:31,240
So selection, right?

2176
01:49:31,240 --> 01:49:36,240
So for eons, the system was shaped,

2177
01:49:38,320 --> 01:49:40,360
it was selected for specific behaviors,

2178
01:49:40,360 --> 01:49:42,320
everything else died out and there you go.

2179
01:49:42,320 --> 01:49:45,000
But here, you can't use that story here

2180
01:49:45,000 --> 01:49:46,720
because there's never been any xenobots.

2181
01:49:46,720 --> 01:49:49,280
There has never been any selection to be a good xenobot.

2182
01:49:49,280 --> 01:49:53,040
Where did these capacities come from?

2183
01:49:53,040 --> 01:49:56,760
Where did their ability to do kinematic self-replication,

2184
01:49:56,760 --> 01:49:57,600
which to our knowledge,

2185
01:49:57,600 --> 01:49:59,240
doesn't exist anywhere in the biosphere,

2186
01:49:59,240 --> 01:50:00,640
where did that come from?

2187
01:50:00,640 --> 01:50:04,040
Now, we don't know what their cognitive capacities are.

2188
01:50:04,040 --> 01:50:05,040
We're studying that right now.

2189
01:50:05,040 --> 01:50:05,880
What can they sense?

2190
01:50:05,880 --> 01:50:06,720
Do they have preferences?

2191
01:50:06,720 --> 01:50:07,920
How can they learn?

2192
01:50:07,920 --> 01:50:10,280
We don't know any of that yet.

2193
01:50:10,280 --> 01:50:12,200
But we do know that they have novel morphologies

2194
01:50:12,200 --> 01:50:14,440
and novel behaviors and so where does that come from?

2195
01:50:14,440 --> 01:50:16,920
So one way to think about this

2196
01:50:16,920 --> 01:50:20,880
and that same genome by being probed in this way

2197
01:50:20,880 --> 01:50:22,720
is showing us a bit of the latent space,

2198
01:50:22,720 --> 01:50:24,320
a bit of what they are capable of.

2199
01:50:24,320 --> 01:50:26,400
So this is kind of, you know, Jeremy Gay,

2200
01:50:26,400 --> 01:50:27,840
who's an amazing graphic designer

2201
01:50:27,840 --> 01:50:29,400
that does a lot of our artwork,

2202
01:50:29,400 --> 01:50:32,880
did this homage to the famous Hofstadter book,

2203
01:50:32,880 --> 01:50:33,920
Gerd Lescher Bach,

2204
01:50:34,840 --> 01:50:39,840
where he was pointing out that how you look at certain objects

2205
01:50:42,760 --> 01:50:44,800
reveals what you see and what they can do.

2206
01:50:44,800 --> 01:50:46,640
And so through that frog genome,

2207
01:50:46,680 --> 01:50:48,640
when you look through it in a particular way,

2208
01:50:48,640 --> 01:50:50,840
yes, you can see the tadpoles

2209
01:50:50,840 --> 01:50:52,000
and yes, you can see xenobots

2210
01:50:52,000 --> 01:50:53,880
and maybe you can see other things.

2211
01:50:53,880 --> 01:50:56,160
And so what we can say here

2212
01:50:56,160 --> 01:51:00,480
is that these kind of synthetic organisms

2213
01:51:00,480 --> 01:51:01,880
are really a tool.

2214
01:51:01,880 --> 01:51:04,120
They're almost like a periscope or a telescope

2215
01:51:04,120 --> 01:51:06,880
that lets you look into another space

2216
01:51:06,880 --> 01:51:09,760
that we normally don't see into the space of possibilities

2217
01:51:09,760 --> 01:51:11,720
or for example, anatomical structure.

2218
01:51:11,720 --> 01:51:12,920
And so for the last couple of minutes,

2219
01:51:12,920 --> 01:51:14,040
I just wanna talk about this

2220
01:51:14,040 --> 01:51:17,920
and the future of all this in bioengineering and so on.

2221
01:51:17,920 --> 01:51:20,320
And the concepts that we wanna talk about are these.

2222
01:51:20,320 --> 01:51:22,160
We've already talked about multiscale

2223
01:51:22,160 --> 01:51:23,560
competency architecture.

2224
01:51:23,560 --> 01:51:24,960
This idea of polycomputing,

2225
01:51:24,960 --> 01:51:28,720
which Josh Bongard and I came up with to indicate

2226
01:51:28,720 --> 01:51:30,760
the fact that any physical process

2227
01:51:30,760 --> 01:51:32,560
can be treated as a computation,

2228
01:51:32,560 --> 01:51:34,680
as a different computation by different observers,

2229
01:51:34,680 --> 01:51:36,680
depending on how they interpret it.

2230
01:51:36,680 --> 01:51:40,280
And that these observers ourselves observing each other

2231
01:51:40,280 --> 01:51:43,480
and various conspecifics and parasites and so on,

2232
01:51:44,560 --> 01:51:47,200
this idea that really because of this competency,

2233
01:51:47,200 --> 01:51:50,400
because cells and tissues are not a passive material,

2234
01:51:50,400 --> 01:51:54,360
every part is able to hack all the other parts

2235
01:51:54,360 --> 01:51:57,480
by providing signals that exploit their functionality.

2236
01:51:57,480 --> 01:51:59,000
Just like we as engineers,

2237
01:51:59,000 --> 01:52:00,840
and that whole middle part of the talk,

2238
01:52:00,840 --> 01:52:02,360
I was trying to show you that

2239
01:52:02,360 --> 01:52:06,240
triggering complex organ formation and so on,

2240
01:52:06,240 --> 01:52:10,280
you don't have to try to micromanage the molecular steps.

2241
01:52:10,280 --> 01:52:12,660
If you can communicate with a larger system

2242
01:52:12,660 --> 01:52:14,060
to tell it what you want it to do,

2243
01:52:14,060 --> 01:52:15,340
you can take advantage of that.

2244
01:52:15,340 --> 01:52:18,860
Well, biology, we're late to that party as engineers,

2245
01:52:18,860 --> 01:52:21,020
and biology has been doing this all along.

2246
01:52:21,020 --> 01:52:23,260
So I wanna show you a couple of examples.

2247
01:52:23,260 --> 01:52:25,740
The first thing I wanna just mention is,

2248
01:52:25,740 --> 01:52:28,660
building with a gentile materials is very different.

2249
01:52:28,660 --> 01:52:30,380
So when you build with a passive material,

2250
01:52:30,380 --> 01:52:31,700
like making Legos,

2251
01:52:31,700 --> 01:52:34,500
it's on you to put every Lego where it goes.

2252
01:52:34,500 --> 01:52:35,980
All they do is hold shape.

2253
01:52:35,980 --> 01:52:37,540
They have very little competencies

2254
01:52:37,540 --> 01:52:38,660
besides holding their shape.

2255
01:52:38,660 --> 01:52:39,940
So you have to control everything.

2256
01:52:39,940 --> 01:52:41,540
This is molecular medicine.

2257
01:52:41,540 --> 01:52:44,420
This is synthetic biology now.

2258
01:52:44,420 --> 01:52:45,580
This is bioengineering.

2259
01:52:45,580 --> 01:52:47,820
You build everything yourself.

2260
01:52:47,820 --> 01:52:49,780
But so if you wanted to make a tower out of Legos,

2261
01:52:49,780 --> 01:52:51,740
you have to put everything where it goes.

2262
01:52:51,740 --> 01:52:52,580
It's easy.

2263
01:52:52,580 --> 01:52:53,380
There are a few surprises,

2264
01:52:53,380 --> 01:52:56,280
but the problem is if it falls down, that's it.

2265
01:52:56,280 --> 01:52:59,340
You could try to make a tower out of dogs, for example.

2266
01:52:59,340 --> 01:53:00,260
If you made a tower out of,

2267
01:53:00,260 --> 01:53:01,500
if you tried it the old fashioned way

2268
01:53:01,500 --> 01:53:04,220
by stacking dogs on top of each other, that doesn't work.

2269
01:53:04,220 --> 01:53:05,820
The dogs have their own agendas.

2270
01:53:05,820 --> 01:53:07,860
They're gonna walk off, not gonna work.

2271
01:53:07,860 --> 01:53:09,740
But there's a new set of tools

2272
01:53:10,740 --> 01:53:13,860
basically from different parts of this spectrum

2273
01:53:13,860 --> 01:53:14,700
that we talked about,

2274
01:53:14,700 --> 01:53:17,780
different ways of interacting with systems.

2275
01:53:17,780 --> 01:53:20,140
If you don't insist on treating them as this kind of system,

2276
01:53:20,140 --> 01:53:22,340
but you're open to the idea that your material

2277
01:53:22,340 --> 01:53:24,380
might actually be this kind of system.

2278
01:53:24,380 --> 01:53:26,020
And in the case of dogs, it's very obvious.

2279
01:53:26,020 --> 01:53:28,380
In the case of cells, it's only now becoming apparent

2280
01:53:28,380 --> 01:53:31,900
that they are also somewhere here.

2281
01:53:31,900 --> 01:53:33,500
What you can do is train the dogs.

2282
01:53:33,500 --> 01:53:34,820
It's a very different strategy.

2283
01:53:34,820 --> 01:53:36,900
You're now doing behavior shaping

2284
01:53:36,900 --> 01:53:38,600
as opposed to old school engineering.

2285
01:53:38,600 --> 01:53:41,360
But the good news is that this tower repairs itself

2286
01:53:41,360 --> 01:53:43,720
when you knock it down, they'll get right back up.

2287
01:53:43,720 --> 01:53:46,200
And so the question about this competency is,

2288
01:53:46,200 --> 01:53:48,280
what can you expect the subunits to do

2289
01:53:48,280 --> 01:53:50,000
when you're not there to manage them?

2290
01:53:50,000 --> 01:53:51,960
And how do you construct complex things

2291
01:53:51,960 --> 01:53:53,600
out of units like that?

2292
01:53:53,600 --> 01:53:57,000
And the way you do it is by using their natural interface,

2293
01:53:57,000 --> 01:53:59,280
in this case, learning rewards and punishments

2294
01:53:59,280 --> 01:54:00,800
to control their behavior.

2295
01:54:00,800 --> 01:54:01,880
This is hacking.

2296
01:54:01,880 --> 01:54:04,360
Hacking not in the sense of the people

2297
01:54:04,360 --> 01:54:05,640
who steal your credit card numbers,

2298
01:54:05,640 --> 01:54:08,000
but in the sense of using a system

2299
01:54:08,000 --> 01:54:11,720
in not necessarily the way that it was intended to be used,

2300
01:54:11,720 --> 01:54:13,640
but in some clever way that exploits

2301
01:54:13,640 --> 01:54:17,960
the system's own properties for a complex outcome.

2302
01:54:17,960 --> 01:54:20,120
So we see this all the time in behavioral science, right?

2303
01:54:20,120 --> 01:54:22,080
So there are these crazy parasites,

2304
01:54:22,080 --> 01:54:26,040
this toxoplasma that causes animals and humans

2305
01:54:26,040 --> 01:54:27,960
to become less risk averse.

2306
01:54:27,960 --> 01:54:29,400
So captains of industry and people

2307
01:54:29,400 --> 01:54:31,760
who die on motorcycle accidents going too fast

2308
01:54:31,760 --> 01:54:33,520
tend to be infected with this stuff

2309
01:54:33,560 --> 01:54:38,560
because it actually changes your risk aversion level.

2310
01:54:38,720 --> 01:54:42,640
And we've got a fungus that controls ant behavior

2311
01:54:42,640 --> 01:54:43,480
and so on.

2312
01:54:43,480 --> 01:54:47,000
So we know that creatures hack each other's behavioral policies

2313
01:54:47,000 --> 01:54:49,440
for navigating three-dimensional space,

2314
01:54:49,440 --> 01:54:50,280
but that's not all.

2315
01:54:50,280 --> 01:54:52,600
What we're now starting to understand

2316
01:54:52,600 --> 01:54:55,760
is that they're really interesting hacks

2317
01:54:55,760 --> 01:54:59,080
that happen in anatomical and physiological spaces.

2318
01:54:59,080 --> 01:55:02,160
In order to do that, the material, right?

2319
01:55:02,160 --> 01:55:03,280
It's a gentle matter.

2320
01:55:03,280 --> 01:55:06,520
The material on which evolution works,

2321
01:55:06,520 --> 01:55:10,240
so cells and tissues, has to have these various competencies.

2322
01:55:10,240 --> 01:55:11,160
It has to have memories.

2323
01:55:11,160 --> 01:55:13,640
It has to be able to measure things to take in inputs.

2324
01:55:13,640 --> 01:55:16,920
You can't hack something that doesn't have any of that,

2325
01:55:16,920 --> 01:55:17,920
but life does.

2326
01:55:17,920 --> 01:55:19,280
And I wanna show you a couple of examples

2327
01:55:19,280 --> 01:55:21,240
of this plasticity.

2328
01:55:21,240 --> 01:55:24,000
So here is, and this is not Photoshop,

2329
01:55:24,000 --> 01:55:27,160
this is, these are real animals.

2330
01:55:27,160 --> 01:55:30,400
These are flies and on their wings,

2331
01:55:30,400 --> 01:55:32,720
they are running a kind of stripped down

2332
01:55:32,720 --> 01:55:34,320
ant morphogenetic program,

2333
01:55:34,320 --> 01:55:36,640
like a two-dimensional ant morphogenetic program.

2334
01:55:36,640 --> 01:55:38,680
And the reason they do it is because when they flap their

2335
01:55:38,680 --> 01:55:40,000
wings in a particular pattern,

2336
01:55:40,000 --> 01:55:41,360
it looks like ants scurrying around

2337
01:55:41,360 --> 01:55:43,280
and their predators don't wanna deal with the ants

2338
01:55:43,280 --> 01:55:45,040
and they scare them off.

2339
01:55:45,040 --> 01:55:48,120
So it's kind of amazing that on their wings,

2340
01:55:48,120 --> 01:55:51,640
they're able to have these very specific patterns,

2341
01:55:51,640 --> 01:55:53,400
but it's no more amazing than the fly itself.

2342
01:55:53,400 --> 01:55:56,000
I mean, this is just a simplified version

2343
01:55:56,000 --> 01:55:57,720
of what the fly itself is doing,

2344
01:55:57,720 --> 01:55:59,000
but it's in computer sciences,

2345
01:55:59,000 --> 01:56:00,280
would be kind of virtualization.

2346
01:56:00,280 --> 01:56:02,680
The fact that the same tissue can actually make

2347
01:56:02,680 --> 01:56:05,000
different kinds of patterns.

2348
01:56:05,000 --> 01:56:07,080
Now, I wanna show you one of my favorite examples

2349
01:56:07,080 --> 01:56:09,400
of that kind of hacking.

2350
01:56:09,400 --> 01:56:11,240
This is the traditional thing that happens.

2351
01:56:11,240 --> 01:56:14,040
So here's an acorn and we know that what acorns,

2352
01:56:14,040 --> 01:56:17,280
acorn genomes know how to do is make acorn,

2353
01:56:17,280 --> 01:56:18,880
is make oak leaves.

2354
01:56:18,880 --> 01:56:20,560
So they're green, they're flat,

2355
01:56:20,560 --> 01:56:21,880
they have this particular structure.

2356
01:56:21,880 --> 01:56:24,000
This is what that genome does.

2357
01:56:24,000 --> 01:56:27,040
Turns out that with just a little bit of prompting

2358
01:56:27,080 --> 01:56:30,320
from a wasp, these cells are also able

2359
01:56:30,320 --> 01:56:32,520
to make something like this or like this.

2360
01:56:32,520 --> 01:56:33,520
These are galls.

2361
01:56:33,520 --> 01:56:35,840
These are made by the plant cell

2362
01:56:35,840 --> 01:56:39,280
that is infected by this parasite.

2363
01:56:39,280 --> 01:56:41,480
The parasite is hacking these plant cells

2364
01:56:41,480 --> 01:56:43,680
to get them to build something completely different.

2365
01:56:43,680 --> 01:56:46,160
Would we have any clue that these flat green cells

2366
01:56:46,160 --> 01:56:47,920
are able to build something like this

2367
01:56:47,920 --> 01:56:49,480
if we didn't see this example?

2368
01:56:49,480 --> 01:56:51,680
So this is another one of these cases

2369
01:56:51,680 --> 01:56:55,400
where you need to do perturbation experiments.

2370
01:56:55,400 --> 01:56:57,760
In this case, this is a natural one done by this wasp

2371
01:56:57,760 --> 01:57:01,520
to see the latent space of what the system is competent to,

2372
01:57:01,520 --> 01:57:02,480
what is it capable of?

2373
01:57:02,480 --> 01:57:03,920
What else can these cells do?

2374
01:57:03,920 --> 01:57:05,960
And can you imagine all the things that these plant cells

2375
01:57:05,960 --> 01:57:08,320
could do if they can build this kind of stuff?

2376
01:57:08,320 --> 01:57:12,800
So just to finish up here, to really,

2377
01:57:12,800 --> 01:57:16,040
I think all of this pushes in a particular direction,

2378
01:57:16,040 --> 01:57:17,640
kind of again, going back to the sort of

2379
01:57:17,640 --> 01:57:21,720
philosophical side of things, is this an organism?

2380
01:57:21,720 --> 01:57:23,400
It's got a body and it's got some sort of

2381
01:57:23,400 --> 01:57:27,120
cognitive architecture, this frog, is this an organism?

2382
01:57:27,120 --> 01:57:29,520
We tend to think so because we as humans

2383
01:57:29,520 --> 01:57:33,560
have really tiny little observational slits

2384
01:57:33,560 --> 01:57:35,040
through which we see the world.

2385
01:57:35,040 --> 01:57:38,840
We like things that happen not too slowly

2386
01:57:38,840 --> 01:57:40,200
and not too quickly.

2387
01:57:40,200 --> 01:57:44,040
We only can perceive in a certain range

2388
01:57:44,040 --> 01:57:47,680
and thus we only see the animal right here,

2389
01:57:47,680 --> 01:57:51,440
but we now have tools like the xenobot and others

2390
01:57:51,440 --> 01:57:53,320
that can collapse the bigger picture,

2391
01:57:53,320 --> 01:57:55,360
which we normally are pretty blind to,

2392
01:57:55,360 --> 01:57:57,440
into a scale we can actually appreciate

2393
01:57:57,440 --> 01:58:00,600
because this is not the organism, this is the organism.

2394
01:58:00,600 --> 01:58:05,120
It's the cells plus all of the things that can manipulate

2395
01:58:05,120 --> 01:58:07,400
them to do various interesting things.

2396
01:58:07,400 --> 01:58:09,760
It's also the evolutionary cycle wrapped around it.

2397
01:58:09,760 --> 01:58:11,920
It's complex beings like us engineers,

2398
01:58:11,920 --> 01:58:15,440
simple beings like various microbes and the parasites,

2399
01:58:15,440 --> 01:58:18,320
and of course the low agency aspects

2400
01:58:18,320 --> 01:58:20,200
of the environment like chemicals.

2401
01:58:20,200 --> 01:58:23,360
Why do I say all of this is part of the organism?

2402
01:58:23,360 --> 01:58:25,800
Because if you don't understand all this other stuff,

2403
01:58:25,800 --> 01:58:27,080
you really do not understand

2404
01:58:27,080 --> 01:58:28,760
what else these cells are capable of.

2405
01:58:28,760 --> 01:58:31,080
This manifestation is the default.

2406
01:58:31,080 --> 01:58:32,760
It is the most common thing,

2407
01:58:32,760 --> 01:58:36,360
but we are completely blind to all of what it's capable of.

2408
01:58:36,360 --> 01:58:39,520
If we do not understand the other inputs into the system,

2409
01:58:39,520 --> 01:58:41,360
and this is somebody else had mentioned

2410
01:58:41,360 --> 01:58:43,200
that the environment and the context,

2411
01:58:43,200 --> 01:58:44,520
I mean, they're not always there.

2412
01:58:44,520 --> 01:58:48,240
In fact, we need to explore all kinds

2413
01:58:48,960 --> 01:58:50,920
of ones that don't naturally exist

2414
01:58:50,920 --> 01:58:53,920
to really understand what this organism is.

2415
01:58:53,920 --> 01:58:58,480
And so the Xenobot is really a kind of tool

2416
01:58:58,480 --> 01:59:01,480
you can use to peer into other spaces.

2417
01:59:01,480 --> 01:59:03,600
They'll be physiological, the transcriptional.

2418
01:59:03,600 --> 01:59:04,560
I mean, we're studying now

2419
01:59:04,560 --> 01:59:06,280
what the transcriptome of these Xenobots.

2420
01:59:06,280 --> 01:59:09,480
It is not like the transcriptome of frog embryos, by the way.

2421
01:59:10,640 --> 01:59:11,520
This is what it is.

2422
01:59:11,520 --> 01:59:13,480
The environment is full of affordances.

2423
01:59:13,480 --> 01:59:14,800
Some of them low agency,

2424
01:59:14,800 --> 01:59:17,400
some of them rather high agency and everything in between.

2425
01:59:17,400 --> 01:59:21,160
And all of this is part of what actually defines

2426
01:59:21,160 --> 01:59:22,880
what a complex organism is.

2427
01:59:22,880 --> 01:59:25,680
So having seen all this, just to end here,

2428
01:59:25,680 --> 01:59:26,520
having seen all this,

2429
01:59:26,520 --> 01:59:31,280
I will point out that all of the biological natural forms

2430
01:59:31,280 --> 01:59:34,000
that Darwin was impressed by when he said

2431
01:59:34,000 --> 01:59:35,720
endless forms, most beautiful,

2432
01:59:35,720 --> 01:59:39,560
all of that N of one run down the tree of life

2433
01:59:39,560 --> 01:59:42,440
is a tiny region, just a tiny region

2434
01:59:42,440 --> 01:59:45,280
of the state space of all possible beings

2435
01:59:45,280 --> 01:59:46,920
because life is so interoperable

2436
01:59:46,920 --> 01:59:48,200
and so hackable.

2437
01:59:48,200 --> 01:59:50,800
Pretty much every combination of evolved materials,

2438
01:59:50,800 --> 01:59:53,400
so DNA cells and so on, designed material.

2439
01:59:53,400 --> 01:59:56,840
So active matter of various smart appliances and so on.

2440
01:59:56,840 --> 01:59:59,640
And software, any combination of those three things

2441
01:59:59,640 --> 02:00:02,000
is going to be some viable being operating

2442
02:00:02,000 --> 02:00:05,560
in some kind of set of spaces with some cognitive system.

2443
02:00:05,560 --> 02:00:10,120
So cyborgs, hybrids, various kinds of chimeras,

2444
02:00:10,120 --> 02:00:11,600
various kinds of robotics,

2445
02:00:11,600 --> 02:00:13,560
all of these things are somewhere

2446
02:00:13,560 --> 02:00:16,240
in this giant space of possible minds.

2447
02:00:16,280 --> 02:00:18,440
And this has massive implications for us

2448
02:00:18,440 --> 02:00:20,320
on a societal level.

2449
02:00:20,320 --> 02:00:23,840
Because going forward, none of the concepts

2450
02:00:23,840 --> 02:00:26,160
that we grew up with, the sharp distinction

2451
02:00:26,160 --> 02:00:28,800
between humans and non-humans,

2452
02:00:28,800 --> 02:00:30,520
between machines and living beings,

2453
02:00:30,520 --> 02:00:34,640
between intelligence and sort of faking intelligence,

2454
02:00:34,640 --> 02:00:36,800
none of these categories are gonna make it

2455
02:00:36,800 --> 02:00:38,800
through the next couple of decades.

2456
02:00:38,800 --> 02:00:42,000
We need to scrap all of that towards a continuous view

2457
02:00:42,000 --> 02:00:45,000
and a new system of ethics that does not depend

2458
02:00:45,000 --> 02:00:47,200
on the two things that we used to depend on.

2459
02:00:47,200 --> 02:00:49,720
In the olden days, you could ask,

2460
02:00:49,720 --> 02:00:52,080
what are you made of and how did you get here?

2461
02:00:52,080 --> 02:00:54,080
Meaning evolved versus engineered.

2462
02:00:54,080 --> 02:00:55,880
And based on that, you could make a decision

2463
02:00:55,880 --> 02:00:57,560
of how to ethically relate to something,

2464
02:00:57,560 --> 02:00:58,720
you sort of knock on it.

2465
02:00:58,720 --> 02:01:00,200
And if you hear a metallic clangy sound,

2466
02:01:00,200 --> 02:01:02,080
you would say that, ah, you come from a factory,

2467
02:01:02,080 --> 02:01:03,000
you're gonna be pretty boring,

2468
02:01:03,000 --> 02:01:05,000
I can take you apart, whatever.

2469
02:01:05,000 --> 02:01:06,640
None of those things are gonna be good anymore

2470
02:01:06,640 --> 02:01:10,400
because we need to develop novel ways

2471
02:01:10,400 --> 02:01:13,880
to recognize and to relate to beings

2472
02:01:13,880 --> 02:01:16,720
that are nowhere with us on the tree of life.

2473
02:01:16,720 --> 02:01:19,400
They are, we simply cannot judge them that way.

2474
02:01:19,400 --> 02:01:22,000
And this is going to be an exciting

2475
02:01:22,000 --> 02:01:23,800
and grand challenge for the species

2476
02:01:23,800 --> 02:01:28,680
to get beyond a very simplistic view of agency

2477
02:01:28,680 --> 02:01:33,000
towards a more expansive compassion towards other beings

2478
02:01:33,000 --> 02:01:35,800
of radically different composition and provenance.

2479
02:01:35,800 --> 02:01:39,360
So I'll stop here and just say that lots of papers

2480
02:01:39,360 --> 02:01:41,320
that go deeply into all of the things

2481
02:01:41,320 --> 02:01:43,760
that I sort of briefly went over,

2482
02:01:43,760 --> 02:01:47,720
in terms of machines and everything else.

2483
02:01:47,720 --> 02:01:50,280
I'm gonna thank the people who did all the work.

2484
02:01:50,280 --> 02:01:53,280
So these are the postdocs and graduate students

2485
02:01:53,280 --> 02:01:56,160
who did all of the work that I showed you today.

2486
02:01:56,160 --> 02:02:00,320
Many collaborators are various funders,

2487
02:02:00,320 --> 02:02:01,480
the disclosures again.

2488
02:02:02,400 --> 02:02:05,520
Jeremy Gay did all the amazing graphics

2489
02:02:05,520 --> 02:02:07,760
and most of all the animal model systems

2490
02:02:07,760 --> 02:02:09,680
because they do all the heavy lifting

2491
02:02:09,680 --> 02:02:10,840
in teaching us about these things.

2492
02:02:10,840 --> 02:02:14,640
So thank you so much and I will take questions.

2493
02:02:14,640 --> 02:02:15,480
That's wonderful.

2494
02:02:15,480 --> 02:02:18,880
Thank you so much, Michael, for your presentation

2495
02:02:18,880 --> 02:02:20,360
and for your work.

2496
02:02:20,360 --> 02:02:23,160
I mean, the implications are outstanding.

2497
02:02:23,160 --> 02:02:25,840
So thank you so much.

2498
02:02:25,840 --> 02:02:29,120
Given the time, are you okay maybe to take five, 10 minutes?

2499
02:02:29,120 --> 02:02:30,840
Yeah, yeah, sure.

2500
02:02:30,840 --> 02:02:32,400
It's my fault that we went over the two hours.

2501
02:02:32,400 --> 02:02:35,480
So yeah, no, no, no, we all wanted to listen.

2502
02:02:35,480 --> 02:02:37,600
Yeah, if anybody has questions, I'm here.

2503
02:02:37,600 --> 02:02:40,640
Sure, let's go for Richard first.

2504
02:02:40,640 --> 02:02:41,760
Well, thank you very much.

2505
02:02:41,760 --> 02:02:44,160
I'm a non-scientist and a poet.

2506
02:02:45,400 --> 02:02:49,280
And I found this absolutely fascinating in every respect

2507
02:02:50,240 --> 02:02:53,400
and you zipped through it at enormous speeds.

2508
02:02:53,400 --> 02:02:57,640
So I've only been able mentally and hourly

2509
02:02:57,640 --> 02:03:00,000
to take in part of what you've said.

2510
02:03:01,880 --> 02:03:05,840
So I've just got a very simple non-scientific question.

2511
02:03:06,840 --> 02:03:08,680
Right at the end, you said,

2512
02:03:08,680 --> 02:03:11,080
we have, all of this opens up

2513
02:03:14,640 --> 02:03:17,800
our distinctions between what is machine

2514
02:03:17,800 --> 02:03:22,640
and what is biological, what is non-biological,

2515
02:03:22,640 --> 02:03:25,120
et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.

2516
02:03:25,120 --> 02:03:28,680
And you mentioned all of your work

2517
02:03:28,680 --> 02:03:32,840
posits the demand for a new ethics.

2518
02:03:33,960 --> 02:03:36,320
So this is a personal question to you.

2519
02:03:36,560 --> 02:03:39,400
And I raise it because all the way along,

2520
02:03:39,400 --> 02:03:44,400
I've been having all sorts of little ethical quarrels

2521
02:03:44,520 --> 02:03:48,360
with myself, not just with you,

2522
02:03:48,360 --> 02:03:50,560
but with everything that you've said.

2523
02:03:50,560 --> 02:03:53,120
So can I just ask a personal question?

2524
02:03:53,120 --> 02:03:58,120
What are your own personal ethics vis-a-vis the work you're doing

2525
02:04:00,280 --> 02:04:03,320
and vis-a-vis the directions

2526
02:04:03,360 --> 02:04:06,400
in which you see the future happening?

2527
02:04:06,400 --> 02:04:08,280
And what I've got in mind here, of course,

2528
02:04:08,280 --> 02:04:12,000
is that you have spoken about the benefits

2529
02:04:12,000 --> 02:04:14,080
of this kind of work,

2530
02:04:14,080 --> 02:04:19,080
but we all know that scientific advances can be used by,

2531
02:04:19,440 --> 02:04:23,960
let's say, evil people or people who want to use

2532
02:04:23,960 --> 02:04:27,720
and manipulate materials to their own set

2533
02:04:27,720 --> 02:04:30,360
for their old selfish needs.

2534
02:04:30,360 --> 02:04:31,760
So where does that come in?

2535
02:04:31,760 --> 02:04:36,760
And are we in the region of Mary Shelley's Frankenstein?

2536
02:04:40,920 --> 02:04:45,920
Are we in the region of Promethean attacks on the gods?

2537
02:04:52,960 --> 02:04:55,440
There's a few things going on in my head,

2538
02:04:55,440 --> 02:04:58,600
but it really comes down to, I think,

2539
02:04:58,600 --> 02:05:00,480
to ethics and your own views.

2540
02:05:02,760 --> 02:05:05,880
I think that's just enormous admiration

2541
02:05:05,880 --> 02:05:09,360
and thanks for everything that you've given us so far.

2542
02:05:09,360 --> 02:05:10,440
Well, thank you so much.

2543
02:05:10,440 --> 02:05:11,280
I appreciate it.

2544
02:05:11,280 --> 02:05:14,800
I must say I love your background as you can see.

2545
02:05:14,800 --> 02:05:16,360
I have a lot of affinity to that.

2546
02:05:16,360 --> 02:05:18,000
So thank you.

2547
02:05:18,000 --> 02:05:20,360
Let's see, here's what I want to start with

2548
02:05:20,360 --> 02:05:22,320
and I will answer all of that,

2549
02:05:22,320 --> 02:05:24,040
but here's what I want to start with.

2550
02:05:24,040 --> 02:05:27,080
There's a standard kind of view

2551
02:05:27,080 --> 02:05:31,360
that even implicitly underlies a lot of the concern

2552
02:05:31,360 --> 02:05:33,800
when people ask me about these things,

2553
02:05:33,800 --> 02:05:37,560
which is basically this, everything is fine

2554
02:05:37,560 --> 02:05:39,960
and you scientists better not do something

2555
02:05:39,960 --> 02:05:41,560
to really screw it up.

2556
02:05:41,560 --> 02:05:44,280
That is kind of the mainstream assumption.

2557
02:05:44,280 --> 02:05:48,760
And that was sort of understandable back in the day

2558
02:05:48,760 --> 02:05:52,400
when we really could think that things were created

2559
02:05:52,400 --> 02:05:54,960
by someone for us to be the best that they could be

2560
02:05:54,960 --> 02:05:57,200
and really we ought not to screw it up.

2561
02:05:57,200 --> 02:06:01,280
But I think now, I think it's safe to say

2562
02:06:01,280 --> 02:06:03,920
that we have a different vision and this is my vision.

2563
02:06:04,920 --> 02:06:06,840
Things are absolutely not fine.

2564
02:06:06,840 --> 02:06:10,400
And I'm not talking about just the environmental,

2565
02:06:10,400 --> 02:06:13,200
various environmental calamities, but I get,

2566
02:06:13,200 --> 02:06:14,800
and I'm not a clinician,

2567
02:06:14,800 --> 02:06:19,400
but I receive daily phone calls and emails

2568
02:06:19,400 --> 02:06:22,960
from people in the most unbelievable biomedical suffering.

2569
02:06:22,960 --> 02:06:24,800
I mean, my kid has a birth defect.

2570
02:06:24,800 --> 02:06:26,640
I got a tumor, I lost a limb.

2571
02:06:26,640 --> 02:06:28,000
I mean, you can't imagine.

2572
02:06:28,000 --> 02:06:30,280
So people call me every day with this stuff

2573
02:06:30,280 --> 02:06:34,800
and our ability to address that degree of suffering

2574
02:06:34,800 --> 02:06:38,480
and to improve people's opportunity

2575
02:06:38,480 --> 02:06:41,600
to reach their potential given the limitations

2576
02:06:41,600 --> 02:06:44,040
of being born, even in a healthy body, right?

2577
02:06:44,040 --> 02:06:49,040
These limitations, I consider us to be so far off of fine

2578
02:06:51,000 --> 02:06:53,960
that it's, I can't even begin to describe that.

2579
02:06:53,960 --> 02:06:56,440
I think we are not starting here

2580
02:06:56,440 --> 02:06:59,200
and hoping that we don't drop, we are down here.

2581
02:06:59,240 --> 02:07:03,240
And to me, so here's my ethics to get back to your question.

2582
02:07:03,240 --> 02:07:05,480
When people ask me what keeps me up at night

2583
02:07:05,480 --> 02:07:07,360
about all this stuff as an ethical concern,

2584
02:07:07,360 --> 02:07:09,240
here's what keeps me up at night.

2585
02:07:09,240 --> 02:07:14,240
It's the possibility of failure to live up to the promise

2586
02:07:16,880 --> 02:07:18,520
of using this kind of information

2587
02:07:18,520 --> 02:07:21,400
to improve the lived experience for all sentient beings.

2588
02:07:21,400 --> 02:07:22,840
That's literally what it is.

2589
02:07:22,840 --> 02:07:24,840
And I should say, this is not,

2590
02:07:24,840 --> 02:07:27,680
I'm definitely not the only person working on this.

2591
02:07:27,680 --> 02:07:29,720
There are many, many scientists throughout the world

2592
02:07:29,720 --> 02:07:31,280
who have the exact same issue

2593
02:07:31,280 --> 02:07:33,720
who are all working towards the same thing.

2594
02:07:33,720 --> 02:07:36,840
Various degrees of freedom of embodiment

2595
02:07:36,840 --> 02:07:40,280
and regenerative medicine and all of these kinds of things.

2596
02:07:40,280 --> 02:07:44,640
So this is not just, so I don't see it that I myself,

2597
02:07:44,640 --> 02:07:46,640
I'm going to sort of fix all these problems.

2598
02:07:46,640 --> 02:07:49,240
I'm speaking now for my view in the community

2599
02:07:50,400 --> 02:07:55,400
that we have a moral responsibility

2600
02:07:55,440 --> 02:07:59,960
and an absolute kind of imperative

2601
02:07:59,960 --> 02:08:02,800
to use this information to improve the state

2602
02:08:02,800 --> 02:08:04,520
of beings in this world now.

2603
02:08:04,520 --> 02:08:09,520
I do not believe we were sort of both physically in the world

2604
02:08:11,840 --> 02:08:16,200
and in terms of our IQ level,

2605
02:08:16,200 --> 02:08:18,280
our susceptibility to various weird diseases

2606
02:08:18,280 --> 02:08:19,800
to brain degeneration.

2607
02:08:19,800 --> 02:08:21,880
I do not believe that any of this is optimized.

2608
02:08:21,880 --> 02:08:24,200
Evolution did not optimize this for our happiness.

2609
02:08:24,200 --> 02:08:25,800
It did not optimize for intelligence.

2610
02:08:25,800 --> 02:08:27,880
Evolution optimizes for biomass.

2611
02:08:27,880 --> 02:08:28,720
That's it.

2612
02:08:28,720 --> 02:08:31,760
And so it happens to have dropped us at this level,

2613
02:08:31,760 --> 02:08:34,200
which is a little bit of IQ

2614
02:08:34,200 --> 02:08:38,120
and a little bit of survival over seven, eight decades tops.

2615
02:08:38,120 --> 02:08:38,960
And that's it.

2616
02:08:38,960 --> 02:08:41,960
And I don't see this as optimal in any way.

2617
02:08:41,960 --> 02:08:46,960
This is due to the vagaries of the evolutionary process

2618
02:08:46,960 --> 02:08:49,200
and it is now on us, now that we can,

2619
02:08:49,200 --> 02:08:51,520
to make improvements for everybody.

2620
02:08:51,520 --> 02:08:52,680
That's how I see this.

2621
02:08:53,680 --> 02:08:54,680
Thank you very much.

2622
02:08:54,680 --> 02:08:56,680
That's a terrific answer.

2623
02:08:56,680 --> 02:08:57,960
Thank you.

2624
02:08:57,960 --> 02:09:02,400
Tell you on me then, is absolutely crucial to your work.

2625
02:09:02,400 --> 02:09:03,240
Is that right?

2626
02:09:03,240 --> 02:09:08,240
The goal, the view that we are working,

2627
02:09:10,600 --> 02:09:14,720
we are goal-orientated is absolutely crucial then.

2628
02:09:15,600 --> 02:09:16,720
Absolutely.

2629
02:09:16,720 --> 02:09:19,040
And in two ways, let me say this about you.

2630
02:09:19,040 --> 02:09:21,480
So goal-directedness,

2631
02:09:21,600 --> 02:09:24,440
and I'm saying, never mind just us,

2632
02:09:24,440 --> 02:09:26,720
all the way down to you can even,

2633
02:09:26,720 --> 02:09:28,200
with least action, the kinds of things

2634
02:09:28,200 --> 02:09:30,800
you can even talk about particles and simple matter,

2635
02:09:30,800 --> 02:09:33,480
simple matter systems, all the way down.

2636
02:09:33,480 --> 02:09:38,480
And the reason, people who don't like any of it,

2637
02:09:38,960 --> 02:09:41,680
say don't use the word, people who really like teleology

2638
02:09:41,680 --> 02:09:44,280
say use teleology, don't say teleonomy.

2639
02:09:44,280 --> 02:09:46,440
Teleonomy was apparent to the goals, right?

2640
02:09:46,440 --> 02:09:48,320
And it's sort of this hedge that some people use

2641
02:09:48,320 --> 02:09:52,280
to sort of try to avoid being on the bad side

2642
02:09:52,280 --> 02:09:54,680
of the modern paradigm and so on.

2643
02:09:54,680 --> 02:09:57,160
The reason I actually like teleonomy

2644
02:09:57,160 --> 02:09:59,360
is not to go soft on the teleology angle.

2645
02:09:59,360 --> 02:10:00,800
I'm full in.

2646
02:10:00,800 --> 02:10:02,880
The reason what's interesting about teleonomy

2647
02:10:02,880 --> 02:10:07,200
is the fact of apparent means that you're acknowledging

2648
02:10:07,200 --> 02:10:10,480
that there is an observer from whose perspective

2649
02:10:10,480 --> 02:10:11,520
you're describing this.

2650
02:10:11,520 --> 02:10:12,600
And I think that's critical.

2651
02:10:12,600 --> 02:10:14,360
Most of, if we sort of drill down

2652
02:10:14,360 --> 02:10:15,800
into the philosophical underpinnings

2653
02:10:15,800 --> 02:10:17,640
of the things I've been talking about,

2654
02:10:17,640 --> 02:10:20,400
it is very critical that there is not one

2655
02:10:20,400 --> 02:10:23,200
objective right answer to all of this.

2656
02:10:23,200 --> 02:10:24,800
How intelligent is something?

2657
02:10:24,800 --> 02:10:26,840
Well, you're really taking an IQ test yourself

2658
02:10:26,840 --> 02:10:28,360
when you make that claim.

2659
02:10:28,360 --> 02:10:29,400
You might have a human brain

2660
02:10:29,400 --> 02:10:31,000
and you might think it makes a great paperweight

2661
02:10:31,000 --> 02:10:32,280
because you weren't smart enough to know

2662
02:10:32,280 --> 02:10:33,560
what else it knows how to do.

2663
02:10:33,560 --> 02:10:36,880
So all of this from the perspective of some observer

2664
02:10:36,880 --> 02:10:40,560
being that being another cell, a human scientist,

2665
02:10:40,560 --> 02:10:44,280
a conspecific, a parasite who seeks to hack the system

2666
02:10:44,280 --> 02:10:47,040
and engineer, everything is from somebody's perspective.

2667
02:10:47,600 --> 02:10:49,200
So that's why I like teleonomy,

2668
02:10:49,200 --> 02:10:53,560
but I'm 100% into the teleology angle.

2669
02:10:55,040 --> 02:11:00,040
So Gary's points earlier about non-locality

2670
02:11:02,240 --> 02:11:06,160
and the implicit idea that,

2671
02:11:07,920 --> 02:11:11,640
I don't know, could one end up with a Gaia hypothesis?

2672
02:11:11,640 --> 02:11:13,880
Does this relate to a Gaia hypothesis?

2673
02:11:14,080 --> 02:11:16,440
The whole of nature,

2674
02:11:19,000 --> 02:11:22,080
there is a purpose somewhere inherent

2675
02:11:22,080 --> 02:11:23,960
in the whole of nature.

2676
02:11:23,960 --> 02:11:28,960
Well, yes, although I wanna be really clear on this,

2677
02:11:29,600 --> 02:11:30,600
it is not simple.

2678
02:11:30,600 --> 02:11:32,200
I mean, those kind of hypotheses

2679
02:11:32,200 --> 02:11:34,360
are often criticized in the following way.

2680
02:11:35,760 --> 02:11:39,120
Well, you can just add those labels to anything.

2681
02:11:39,120 --> 02:11:40,360
You can sort of look outwards and say,

2682
02:11:40,360 --> 02:11:43,160
there's nature, I'm gonna call it Gaia and here we go.

2683
02:11:43,880 --> 02:11:44,720
So I'm not saying that,

2684
02:11:44,720 --> 02:11:47,040
what I'm saying is that actually,

2685
02:11:47,040 --> 02:11:50,880
I'm insisting that all of those kinds of things

2686
02:11:50,880 --> 02:11:52,960
are actually empirical hypotheses.

2687
02:11:52,960 --> 02:11:55,840
So that means that if you have the Gaia hypothesis,

2688
02:11:55,840 --> 02:11:59,040
what that should do for you is to be able to say

2689
02:11:59,040 --> 02:12:03,520
which tools can you use to benefit

2690
02:12:03,520 --> 02:12:05,680
from the agency you're hypothesizing.

2691
02:12:05,680 --> 02:12:07,600
So for example, if you think that

2692
02:12:08,440 --> 02:12:13,440
some sort of ecosystem is a higher level

2693
02:12:14,760 --> 02:12:17,640
protocognitive agent, you should be able to train it.

2694
02:12:17,640 --> 02:12:20,000
You should be able to find them and decode the memory.

2695
02:12:20,000 --> 02:12:22,440
You should be able to show some tools

2696
02:12:22,440 --> 02:12:24,800
from behavioral science that work at that level.

2697
02:12:24,800 --> 02:12:26,080
And to the extent that you can do that,

2698
02:12:26,080 --> 02:12:28,960
your hypothesis is validated, right?

2699
02:12:28,960 --> 02:12:30,720
All of this, and we do this all the time,

2700
02:12:30,720 --> 02:12:33,680
we apply these kinds of, to me, all of these claims,

2701
02:12:33,680 --> 02:12:35,480
what these claims really are,

2702
02:12:36,320 --> 02:12:38,400
protocols for engineering protocols.

2703
02:12:38,400 --> 02:12:40,080
So if somebody gives me something and says,

2704
02:12:40,080 --> 02:12:42,680
I tell you that the level of intelligence

2705
02:12:42,680 --> 02:12:45,040
in the system is X, what I hear is,

2706
02:12:45,040 --> 02:12:46,800
ah, so here are the things in my toolbox

2707
02:12:46,800 --> 02:12:48,160
that I can use to interact with it.

2708
02:12:48,160 --> 02:12:49,120
That's what you've told me.

2709
02:12:49,120 --> 02:12:50,520
And you might be right and you might be wrong,

2710
02:12:50,520 --> 02:12:52,400
or I might be more or less clever

2711
02:12:52,400 --> 02:12:54,360
and find some better way to interact with it.

2712
02:12:54,360 --> 02:12:55,880
But that's what I hear.

2713
02:12:55,880 --> 02:12:58,400
So the Gaia hypothesis maybe,

2714
02:12:58,400 --> 02:13:01,600
but it is a hypothesis that should be empirically tested

2715
02:13:01,600 --> 02:13:02,840
and somebody should come out and say,

2716
02:13:02,840 --> 02:13:04,760
look, I've done associative conditioning

2717
02:13:04,760 --> 02:13:06,440
on a whole ecosystem, and it works.

2718
02:13:06,440 --> 02:13:08,320
And we've done that on molecular networks, by the way.

2719
02:13:08,320 --> 02:13:12,480
We did that on molecular network models,

2720
02:13:12,480 --> 02:13:15,240
which look very deterministic and very simple and all that.

2721
02:13:15,240 --> 02:13:17,080
Turns out they can do six different kinds of learning.

2722
02:13:17,080 --> 02:13:17,920
Who knew?

2723
02:13:17,920 --> 02:13:20,360
Nobody would have known until you do the experiment.

2724
02:13:21,960 --> 02:13:24,200
And Gaia, shut up, and thank you very much

2725
02:13:24,200 --> 02:13:26,920
because I'm sure lots of other people have got questions.

2726
02:13:26,920 --> 02:13:28,320
Thank you so much.

2727
02:13:28,320 --> 02:13:29,400
Thank you, Richard.

2728
02:13:30,360 --> 02:13:32,520
So yeah, so unfortunately we are towards the,

2729
02:13:32,520 --> 02:13:35,400
we're getting, we've gone quite a bit over.

2730
02:13:35,400 --> 02:13:38,040
However, if after we finish the call,

2731
02:13:38,040 --> 02:13:39,520
I can always leave the room open.

2732
02:13:39,520 --> 02:13:41,240
If, Michael, you're happy to stay

2733
02:13:41,240 --> 02:13:44,640
and answer any questions that there may be.

2734
02:13:44,640 --> 02:13:45,480
Sure, I'll stay.

2735
02:13:45,480 --> 02:13:48,000
Yeah, I'll stay for another 15 minutes.

2736
02:13:48,000 --> 02:13:50,120
I've got till 2.30, so I can, yeah.

2737
02:13:50,120 --> 02:13:51,280
I'll stay for another 15.

2738
02:13:51,280 --> 02:13:52,120
Fantastic.

2739
02:13:52,120 --> 02:13:54,680
Well, just for the purposes of the session,

2740
02:13:54,680 --> 02:13:56,240
we should close.

2741
02:13:56,240 --> 02:14:00,760
But Michael, do you have any final words to leave us with?

2742
02:14:01,760 --> 02:14:03,640
No, I think I've said,

2743
02:14:03,640 --> 02:14:05,920
I've drawn on a lot long enough.

2744
02:14:05,920 --> 02:14:07,320
So thank you, everybody.

2745
02:14:07,320 --> 02:14:09,440
Great questions, great discussion.

2746
02:14:09,440 --> 02:14:11,080
I really appreciate your listening.

2747
02:14:11,080 --> 02:14:11,920
No, thank you.

2748
02:14:11,920 --> 02:14:13,760
Well, thank you so much, Michael.

2749
02:14:13,760 --> 02:14:16,440
Your work has been, as I said, outstanding.

2750
02:14:16,440 --> 02:14:19,560
So I hope we show all the best of luck with your research.

2751
02:14:19,560 --> 02:14:20,520
And that...

2752
02:14:20,520 --> 02:14:21,280
Thank you so much.

2753
02:14:21,280 --> 02:14:22,120
Yeah.

2754
02:14:22,120 --> 02:14:22,960
Thank you.

2755
02:14:22,960 --> 02:14:25,680
And yeah, of course, thank everyone who joined us today.

2756
02:14:25,680 --> 02:14:28,240
Before we go, just a quick reminder that tomorrow

2757
02:14:28,240 --> 02:14:30,080
we will have Dr. Julian Mossbridge

2758
02:14:30,080 --> 02:14:33,120
talking about human thinking and human being

2759
02:14:33,120 --> 02:14:35,800
as part of this series.

2760
02:14:35,800 --> 02:14:37,760
But until tomorrow, if you do have any questions,

2761
02:14:37,760 --> 02:14:43,240
feel free to drop us an email at elinoratbarcenter.com.

2762
02:14:43,240 --> 02:14:44,360
And thank you again, everyone.

2763
02:14:44,360 --> 02:14:45,280
Thank you, Michael.

2764
02:14:45,280 --> 02:14:47,640
As I said, I will leave the call open.

2765
02:14:47,640 --> 02:14:50,200
I'll pass it over to you, Michael, as a host

2766
02:14:50,200 --> 02:14:52,200
to carry on for whoever would like to.

2767
02:14:52,200 --> 02:14:56,600
But thank you again, everyone, from here at the Bar Centre.

2768
02:14:56,600 --> 02:14:57,440
Thank you.

2769
02:15:00,720 --> 02:15:03,280
Yeah, so I think we can...

2770
02:15:03,280 --> 02:15:05,920
Yeah, everyone would like to jump in.

2771
02:15:05,920 --> 02:15:08,080
Yeah, that's fine.

2772
02:15:08,080 --> 02:15:12,520
Michael, thank you for that stunning presentation.

2773
02:15:12,520 --> 02:15:15,680
It's a very general question I'd like to ask.

2774
02:15:15,680 --> 02:15:18,640
And it's really to do with evolution.

2775
02:15:18,640 --> 02:15:23,760
I'm aware of many very credible scientists

2776
02:15:23,760 --> 02:15:27,680
who believe that there are other mechanisms involved

2777
02:15:27,680 --> 02:15:32,360
in evolution, some form of intelligence

2778
02:15:32,360 --> 02:15:37,200
or maybe a mechanism that results in good choices being made.

2779
02:15:37,200 --> 02:15:40,600
I can think of one quantum physicist that actually says

2780
02:15:40,600 --> 02:15:43,120
that, well, consciousness chooses.

2781
02:15:43,120 --> 02:15:46,840
Given the astonishing things you've discovered,

2782
02:15:46,840 --> 02:15:51,360
what is your intuition about evolution

2783
02:15:51,360 --> 02:15:54,800
and whether or not it could possibly be or it is

2784
02:15:54,800 --> 02:15:58,840
random mutations giving some kind of advantage?

2785
02:15:59,840 --> 02:16:01,680
Yeah, well, a couple of things.

2786
02:16:01,680 --> 02:16:06,360
First, the very best person to talk about this with

2787
02:16:06,360 --> 02:16:09,320
is a guy named Richard Watson in the UK.

2788
02:16:09,320 --> 02:16:13,000
And he has what I think is hands down

2789
02:16:13,000 --> 02:16:17,160
the biggest advance in evolutionary thinking.

2790
02:16:17,160 --> 02:16:18,360
And I don't know how long.

2791
02:16:18,360 --> 02:16:22,000
So you guys might want to invite him to speak.

2792
02:16:22,040 --> 02:16:25,080
But here's what I do know.

2793
02:16:27,280 --> 02:16:32,280
Given the various things we've observed our systems doing,

2794
02:16:34,360 --> 02:16:36,600
it would not be very hard to build

2795
02:16:36,600 --> 02:16:41,600
a synthetic biology system in which edited its genome

2796
02:16:43,160 --> 02:16:46,000
with some degree of conscious intent.

2797
02:16:46,000 --> 02:16:47,760
Okay, that would not be difficult.

2798
02:16:47,760 --> 02:16:52,240
Therefore, given that I sort of go with this idea

2799
02:16:52,240 --> 02:16:54,720
that whatever is not physically impossible

2800
02:16:54,720 --> 02:16:57,200
is probably doable somewhere,

2801
02:16:57,200 --> 02:17:00,000
I would find it not surprising at all

2802
02:17:00,000 --> 02:17:00,960
that that would be the case

2803
02:17:00,960 --> 02:17:02,880
because I can certainly see how we would construct

2804
02:17:02,880 --> 02:17:03,720
such a thing.

2805
02:17:04,720 --> 02:17:07,920
However, what I don't have is a lot of evidence

2806
02:17:07,920 --> 02:17:09,600
that that in fact is what's happening.

2807
02:17:09,600 --> 02:17:14,080
So my gut feeling is if I had to say gut feeling,

2808
02:17:14,080 --> 02:17:17,640
I do not believe that the standard purely random account

2809
02:17:17,640 --> 02:17:21,360
of evolution is sufficient to explain what we see.

2810
02:17:21,360 --> 02:17:25,720
But I'm not sure there's superb evidence

2811
02:17:25,720 --> 02:17:28,360
to sort of rule it out.

2812
02:17:28,360 --> 02:17:32,080
And I want to be very clear in distinguishing

2813
02:17:32,080 --> 02:17:34,440
because people tend to jump from one to the other.

2814
02:17:34,440 --> 02:17:38,880
One thing is saying that there is a non-random influence

2815
02:17:38,880 --> 02:17:40,480
over the process, right?

2816
02:17:40,480 --> 02:17:42,120
And I think that's not surprise.

2817
02:17:42,120 --> 02:17:43,880
I wouldn't be surprised by that at all.

2818
02:17:43,880 --> 02:17:45,800
It's quite something else to say

2819
02:17:45,800 --> 02:17:48,240
there is a high level benevolent intelligence

2820
02:17:48,240 --> 02:17:49,960
guiding the process tour, right?

2821
02:17:49,960 --> 02:17:51,640
That's a whole other kettle of fish, right?

2822
02:17:51,640 --> 02:17:54,400
And I have zero reason to think that's the case.

2823
02:17:54,400 --> 02:17:59,400
So some level of control mechanism that isn't randomness,

2824
02:17:59,560 --> 02:18:02,360
I'm probably on board with that, but that's it.

2825
02:18:02,360 --> 02:18:04,800
I wouldn't, I don't think we can, I mean, it's not impossible

2826
02:18:04,800 --> 02:18:07,480
but I don't think we can jump from that to anything else.

2827
02:18:07,480 --> 02:18:10,040
So that's, you know, just want to say that.

2828
02:18:10,040 --> 02:18:11,400
Great, thank you.

2829
02:18:11,400 --> 02:18:13,120
That's very clear, thank you.

2830
02:18:13,120 --> 02:18:13,960
Thank you.

2831
02:18:16,800 --> 02:18:17,800
Okay, just.

2832
02:18:21,800 --> 02:18:22,640
Who else?

2833
02:18:22,640 --> 02:18:26,800
I think Niels and Vyans had a hand up.

2834
02:18:30,800 --> 02:18:32,280
Yeah, please, somebody go.

2835
02:18:32,280 --> 02:18:34,400
Does Neil want to go in or I'd be glad to.

2836
02:18:34,400 --> 02:18:35,960
I have sort of a non-sense.

2837
02:18:35,960 --> 02:18:36,800
Ladies first.

2838
02:18:39,320 --> 02:18:40,680
Okay, thanks.

2839
02:18:40,680 --> 02:18:42,480
Listen, I just wanted to know something about

2840
02:18:42,480 --> 02:18:45,280
from one of the very first slides you presented

2841
02:18:45,280 --> 02:18:49,000
of a cell gravitating towards the three petri dishes.

2842
02:18:49,000 --> 02:18:54,000
If there had been a nutrient in the upper petri dish,

2843
02:18:54,040 --> 02:18:56,640
would that migrated up there

2844
02:18:56,640 --> 02:18:59,720
or would it still go on towards the weightier?

2845
02:18:59,720 --> 02:19:01,360
Yeah, great, great question.

2846
02:19:01,360 --> 02:19:04,720
We have started but not finished a book,

2847
02:19:04,720 --> 02:19:09,360
not a book, probably a paper on the psychology of slime mold.

2848
02:19:09,360 --> 02:19:11,960
And all of these kinds of questions

2849
02:19:11,960 --> 02:19:13,560
in terms of what does it prefer?

2850
02:19:13,560 --> 02:19:14,960
How does it make decisions?

2851
02:19:14,960 --> 02:19:18,080
When two things are, you know, sort of great question.

2852
02:19:18,080 --> 02:19:20,440
It depends on the nutrient and it depends, I mean,

2853
02:19:20,440 --> 02:19:23,040
nutrient, if it's hungry, nutrients tend to win.

2854
02:19:23,040 --> 02:19:24,800
So if it's hungry, it will go for the food

2855
02:19:24,800 --> 02:19:26,360
and ignore the mass.

2856
02:19:26,360 --> 02:19:28,040
By the way, those little, I should say,

2857
02:19:28,040 --> 02:19:30,080
those little white discs, they're not petri dishes,

2858
02:19:30,080 --> 02:19:32,160
they're little tiny glass discs.

2859
02:19:32,160 --> 02:19:34,120
Right through a glass, tiny glass.

2860
02:19:34,120 --> 02:19:37,400
Each one of which weighs about 10 milligrams.

2861
02:19:37,400 --> 02:19:40,840
So this thing can sense at a distance of 10 centimeters,

2862
02:19:40,840 --> 02:19:43,760
the difference between 10 milligrams and 30 milligrams.

2863
02:19:43,760 --> 02:19:45,560
It is ridiculously sensitive.

2864
02:19:45,560 --> 02:19:48,160
But nutrients, nutrients will tend to win.

2865
02:19:48,160 --> 02:19:51,720
Yeah, it's just been the most amazing presentation.

2866
02:19:51,720 --> 02:19:52,560
Thank you.

2867
02:19:52,560 --> 02:19:53,400
Thank you so much.

2868
02:19:53,400 --> 02:19:54,240
Thank you.

2869
02:19:54,240 --> 02:19:55,080
Yeah.

2870
02:19:55,080 --> 02:19:55,920
Niels.

2871
02:19:57,400 --> 02:20:02,400
Yes, amazing, a lot of stuff and little bits floating

2872
02:20:04,640 --> 02:20:07,760
around here and there and all over the place.

2873
02:20:08,760 --> 02:20:11,000
That was very interesting.

2874
02:20:11,880 --> 02:20:16,880
In my case, I've been a computer chap for over 50 years

2875
02:20:21,880 --> 02:20:26,320
and I've managed to do what I now can see

2876
02:20:26,320 --> 02:20:28,080
quite remarkable things.

2877
02:20:28,080 --> 02:20:33,080
And so I spent some time trying to keep up with you

2878
02:20:33,920 --> 02:20:37,800
because I immediately started thinking about all the things

2879
02:20:37,800 --> 02:20:42,080
that I could implant into this.

2880
02:20:42,080 --> 02:20:45,920
And so it's really,

2881
02:20:48,920 --> 02:20:53,520
you've heard about P equal NP complete, I'm sure.

2882
02:20:53,520 --> 02:20:54,360
Yeah.

2883
02:20:55,360 --> 02:20:58,560
What difference would that make, do you think?

2884
02:20:59,560 --> 02:21:04,560
To find, because that would basically be able to hold

2885
02:21:05,920 --> 02:21:10,920
everything together in all its complexity.

2886
02:21:11,600 --> 02:21:15,600
And so I have some experience with that for

2887
02:21:16,560 --> 02:21:20,560
in terms of transportation modeling and pedestrian

2888
02:21:20,560 --> 02:21:23,560
and all these interactions and things.

2889
02:21:23,560 --> 02:21:27,560
So I was thinking, I'm not sure if I'm going to be able

2890
02:21:27,560 --> 02:21:32,560
to get involved in there and try and simulate it

2891
02:21:32,560 --> 02:21:37,560
in a deterministic way, not in a stochastic way.

2892
02:21:39,560 --> 02:21:41,560
Yeah, drop me an email.

2893
02:21:41,560 --> 02:21:44,560
I mean, this is, we do about a third of my group.

2894
02:21:44,560 --> 02:21:46,560
My background is computer science as well.

2895
02:21:46,560 --> 02:21:51,560
And about a third of my group is computational

2896
02:21:51,560 --> 02:21:53,560
and the others are bench biologists.

2897
02:21:53,560 --> 02:21:56,560
So we do a ton of modeling and simulation of this stuff.

2898
02:21:57,560 --> 02:21:59,560
So just drop me an email and we could talk

2899
02:21:59,560 --> 02:22:01,560
about what can be done.

2900
02:22:01,560 --> 02:22:03,560
Yes, I would love to do that.

2901
02:22:03,560 --> 02:22:04,560
Great, great.

2902
02:22:04,560 --> 02:22:05,560
Yeah.

2903
02:22:05,560 --> 02:22:06,560
Okay, thank you.

2904
02:22:06,560 --> 02:22:07,560
It was a great talk.

2905
02:22:07,560 --> 02:22:08,560
Thank you so much.

2906
02:22:08,560 --> 02:22:10,560
Lots of information in that.

2907
02:22:10,560 --> 02:22:11,560
Thank you.

2908
02:22:11,560 --> 02:22:12,560
Thank you.

2909
02:22:13,560 --> 02:22:14,560
Phillip.

2910
02:22:15,560 --> 02:22:16,560
Hello.

2911
02:22:16,560 --> 02:22:17,560
Hi.

2912
02:22:17,560 --> 02:22:21,560
I'd like to take you back to the body of the planaria worm.

2913
02:22:21,560 --> 02:22:23,560
And we're talking about the heads and the two heads.

2914
02:22:23,560 --> 02:22:27,560
And in order for the body to form,

2915
02:22:27,560 --> 02:22:31,560
apparently there's a bioelectric distribution that.

2916
02:22:33,560 --> 02:22:35,560
Allows us to happen.

2917
02:22:35,560 --> 02:22:38,560
And I'm wondering what you think of the source of that distribution

2918
02:22:38,560 --> 02:22:41,560
within the biomass of the body is.

2919
02:22:41,560 --> 02:22:43,560
Yeah.

2920
02:22:43,560 --> 02:22:46,560
Are you asking physically which cells it's in?

2921
02:22:46,560 --> 02:22:48,560
Are you asking where it came from?

2922
02:22:48,560 --> 02:22:50,560
I'm asking where it came from.

2923
02:22:50,560 --> 02:22:51,560
Right.

2924
02:22:51,560 --> 02:22:54,560
Well, that's, that's a great, that's a great question.

2925
02:22:54,560 --> 02:22:57,560
So let's, um, the, the best way to think about,

2926
02:22:57,560 --> 02:22:58,560
and we're still,

2927
02:22:58,560 --> 02:23:00,560
we're still groping for the right metaphors to understand it,

2928
02:23:00,560 --> 02:23:03,560
but let's, let me, let me give you what, what I have so far.

2929
02:23:03,560 --> 02:23:04,560
Um,

2930
02:23:04,560 --> 02:23:08,560
The thing with asking where things came from is, is this, and I think,

2931
02:23:08,560 --> 02:23:10,560
you know, maybe, maybe some of the, um,

2932
02:23:10,560 --> 02:23:13,560
non science people on the call will like this more than,

2933
02:23:13,560 --> 02:23:15,560
more than the science people, but, but, but here you go.

2934
02:23:15,560 --> 02:23:17,560
Um, imagine a, um,

2935
02:23:17,560 --> 02:23:19,560
um, uh, imagine a Galton board.

2936
02:23:19,560 --> 02:23:22,560
If you haven't seen one of these things, you can buy a toy of it on Amazon.

2937
02:23:22,560 --> 02:23:23,560
It's 15 bucks.

2938
02:23:23,560 --> 02:23:26,560
It's a wooden board like this and you bang a bunch of nails into it vertically,

2939
02:23:26,560 --> 02:23:29,560
you know, vertically, and you take a bucket and you take a bucket of marbles

2940
02:23:29,560 --> 02:23:31,560
and you dump it over and the marbles go boom, boom, boom, boom, boom,

2941
02:23:31,560 --> 02:23:32,560
and they land on the bottom.

2942
02:23:32,560 --> 02:23:35,560
They always land in the same pattern, this beautiful bell curve, right?

2943
02:23:35,560 --> 02:23:37,560
They always make this beautiful bell curve.

2944
02:23:37,560 --> 02:23:40,560
So you can ask this question of, um,

2945
02:23:40,560 --> 02:23:42,560
where's the bell curve encoded?

2946
02:23:42,560 --> 02:23:45,560
So you look at the wood and you don't really see it there and you look at the nails.

2947
02:23:45,560 --> 02:23:48,560
You don't really see it there and you look at the distribution of nails and

2948
02:23:48,560 --> 02:23:49,560
I really see it there.

2949
02:23:49,560 --> 02:23:53,560
What you find out, and this is, you know, uh, uh, mathematicians,

2950
02:23:53,560 --> 02:23:56,560
like, like, uh, Pythagoras and Plato have been saying this for, for,

2951
02:23:56,560 --> 02:23:57,560
for a long time.

2952
02:23:57,560 --> 02:24:00,560
What you find out is that when you build certain kinds of machines,

2953
02:24:00,560 --> 02:24:04,560
you are actually harnessing patterns that exist.

2954
02:24:04,560 --> 02:24:08,560
I don't know where, you know, Plato thought there was a separate world for them,

2955
02:24:08,560 --> 02:24:12,560
but, but, but this is, you know, so, so for example, when you make a couple of

2956
02:24:12,560 --> 02:24:15,560
transistors, meaning ion channels, when you, ion channels are transistors,

2957
02:24:15,560 --> 02:24:17,560
they're voltage gated current conductances.

2958
02:24:17,560 --> 02:24:20,560
When, when evolution discovers a couple of ion channels,

2959
02:24:20,560 --> 02:24:23,560
it can make logic gates which come with truth tables.

2960
02:24:23,560 --> 02:24:25,560
Evolution doesn't have to discover truth tables there.

2961
02:24:25,560 --> 02:24:26,560
You get that for free, right?

2962
02:24:26,560 --> 02:24:29,560
And the fact that the NAND gate is, you know, uh,

2963
02:24:29,560 --> 02:24:32,560
it has these special properties, you get that, you get all of that for free.

2964
02:24:32,560 --> 02:24:33,560
It's a free gift from somewhere.

2965
02:24:33,560 --> 02:24:34,560
We don't know where it is.

2966
02:24:34,560 --> 02:24:37,560
So what we have here is something similar.

2967
02:24:37,560 --> 02:24:42,560
What evolution did is find a set of ion channels that are expressed

2968
02:24:42,560 --> 02:24:46,560
in a standard planarian that by default, when you turn on the juice,

2969
02:24:46,560 --> 02:24:52,560
what that system does is stable is, is, is, is find and stabilize in an

2970
02:24:52,560 --> 02:24:56,560
attractor in the state space of the, of the electrical circuit that corresponds

2971
02:24:56,560 --> 02:24:57,560
to one head.

2972
02:24:57,560 --> 02:25:00,560
By default, still, you know, reliably, that's what it does.

2973
02:25:00,560 --> 02:25:04,560
When you, when we, when we've learned to perturb it, which took, you know,

2974
02:25:04,560 --> 02:25:08,560
10 years to learn to do that, you can push it into a different state and

2975
02:25:08,560 --> 02:25:09,560
it'll do that.

2976
02:25:09,560 --> 02:25:11,560
But the question is where did it come from?

2977
02:25:11,560 --> 02:25:14,560
It's sort of like asking, uh, you know,

2978
02:25:14,560 --> 02:25:17,560
if I give you a collection of parts for a calculator and you turn it on,

2979
02:25:17,560 --> 02:25:21,560
and it says zero by default on a little LCD, where did that come from?

2980
02:25:21,560 --> 02:25:26,560
And it's, it's the result of the laws of physics of computation and some

2981
02:25:26,560 --> 02:25:29,560
other stuff working out through the physical machine.

2982
02:25:29,560 --> 02:25:33,560
And this, all this sounds very airy, fairy and, and sort of, um, uh,

2983
02:25:33,560 --> 02:25:35,560
philosophical, but, but, but here's a practical part.

2984
02:25:35,560 --> 02:25:40,560
Imagine that your evolution and you, in your world, the most fit thing is a

2985
02:25:40,560 --> 02:25:42,560
triangle of a particular type.

2986
02:25:42,560 --> 02:25:45,560
So, so, so you're sorting through this population and eventually you find the

2987
02:25:45,560 --> 02:25:49,560
first angle and then you do some more, you know, every generations go by and

2988
02:25:49,560 --> 02:25:51,560
you eventually find the second angle.

2989
02:25:51,560 --> 02:25:52,560
And now you're done.

2990
02:25:52,560 --> 02:25:54,560
You don't need to go looking for the third angle.

2991
02:25:54,560 --> 02:25:56,560
You know what the third angle is because, because they add up to 180.

2992
02:25:56,560 --> 02:25:58,560
How did you, how did you, if your evolution,

2993
02:25:58,560 --> 02:26:02,560
how did you save two thirds of the effort in, in evolving this thing?

2994
02:26:02,560 --> 02:26:05,560
Where did this magical fact that you know what the third angle is?

2995
02:26:05,560 --> 02:26:06,560
Where did that come from?

2996
02:26:06,560 --> 02:26:11,560
So, so we get here to the point where, um, asking where things come from is tricky.

2997
02:26:11,560 --> 02:26:17,560
We can, we can do the biophysics of that, of, of showing what the space looks

2998
02:26:17,560 --> 02:26:22,560
like and why the system lands in particular regions of that space.

2999
02:26:23,560 --> 02:26:27,560
But it's not super easy to figure out, to ask, it's like, where's the

3000
02:26:27,560 --> 02:26:28,560
distribution of primes come?

3001
02:26:28,560 --> 02:26:29,560
Where's that encoded?

3002
02:26:29,560 --> 02:26:32,560
You know, all the physical facts of the, of the universe could be different

3003
02:26:32,560 --> 02:26:34,560
and the distribution of primes would still be what it is.

3004
02:26:34,560 --> 02:26:39,560
So I think we're, we're literally bumping up against that old question of

3005
02:26:39,560 --> 02:26:43,560
where the truths of mathematics live.

3006
02:26:43,560 --> 02:26:45,560
Okay, I'll just say one final thing.

3007
02:26:45,560 --> 02:26:46,560
Thank you for the answer.

3008
02:26:46,560 --> 02:26:54,560
But what perplexes me very much is how the two headed version comes to be so

3009
02:26:54,560 --> 02:27:01,560
quickly, you know, another, another stable configuration emerges.

3010
02:27:01,560 --> 02:27:06,560
It's, it's, it's very perplexing to me that I agree that it's perplexing.

3011
02:27:06,560 --> 02:27:10,560
And, and I think the, you know, when I first started to understand the,

3012
02:27:10,560 --> 02:27:14,560
when I first saw that Xenobot running around and it suddenly like hit me

3013
02:27:14,560 --> 02:27:18,560
in the head, there's never been any Xenobots like evolution has zero

3014
02:27:18,560 --> 02:27:20,560
explanatory power here.

3015
02:27:20,560 --> 02:27:26,560
I, I, it suddenly dawned on me that what, what, what, what Plato would say to

3016
02:27:26,560 --> 02:27:31,560
this is that the two headed planarian and the Xenobot have always been there.

3017
02:27:31,560 --> 02:27:35,560
They're part of this latent space that we had never had access to.

3018
02:27:35,560 --> 02:27:39,560
And we finally built a physical machine that enables us to see that part of

3019
02:27:39,560 --> 02:27:40,560
the space.

3020
02:27:40,560 --> 02:27:41,560
I think that's what that's what he would say.

3021
02:27:41,560 --> 02:27:46,560
I think that something existed in the past that laid down a certain behavior

3022
02:27:46,560 --> 02:27:48,560
pattern that they're tuning into.

3023
02:27:48,560 --> 02:27:50,560
I don't, I don't think they're creating those patterns.

3024
02:27:50,560 --> 02:27:54,560
I think they're finding patterns that already existed.

3025
02:27:54,560 --> 02:27:57,560
Yeah, I mean, I said, I, right, I think you and I are on the same page here.

3026
02:27:57,560 --> 02:28:02,560
The patterns exist, but I think we have to be, you know, the traditional,

3027
02:28:02,560 --> 02:28:08,560
the traditional scientific story here would be they, they are patterns that,

3028
02:28:08,560 --> 02:28:12,560
you know, typically in a normal tree of life, what you see is these are patterns

3029
02:28:12,560 --> 02:28:18,560
that either existed in some ancestor and were shaped by evolution to be.

3030
02:28:18,560 --> 02:28:20,560
That's not the case here.

3031
02:28:20,560 --> 02:28:24,560
But I agree with you, the patterns exist independently of what we've done.

3032
02:28:24,560 --> 02:28:27,560
We've just stumbled onto them for the first time and who knows what else is out

3033
02:28:27,560 --> 02:28:28,560
there.

3034
02:28:28,560 --> 02:28:29,560
Okay, very good.

3035
02:28:29,560 --> 02:28:32,560
Thank you.

3036
02:28:32,560 --> 02:28:33,560
Thank you.

3037
02:28:33,560 --> 02:28:34,560
Thank you.

3038
02:28:34,560 --> 02:28:35,560
Thank you.

3039
02:28:35,560 --> 02:28:36,560
Thank you.

3040
02:28:36,560 --> 02:28:37,560
Thank you.

3041
02:28:37,560 --> 02:28:38,560
Thank you.

3042
02:28:38,560 --> 02:28:39,560
Thank you.

3043
02:28:39,560 --> 02:28:42,560
Thank you for burning things. I'm going to have to go in about a minute.

3044
02:28:42,560 --> 02:28:43,560
All right.

3045
02:28:43,560 --> 02:28:46,560
Well, thank you so much, everybody. This has been, this has been really fun.

3046
02:28:46,560 --> 02:28:47,560
Yes.

3047
02:28:47,560 --> 02:28:48,560
Yeah.

3048
02:28:48,560 --> 02:28:51,560
Lots of, lots of great things for me to think about. So, so thank you so much.
