0	7280	Hello, everyone, and welcome to the session of Incredible Minds.
7280	11920	I'm James B. Barbieri, program coordinator here at the Paris Center and your host for
11920	13000	today.
13000	17120	Any problems, just let me know in the chat and I'll try and help you.
17120	21520	Just very briefly, a quick reminder to make sure your microphone is muted.
21520	25120	We do encourage you all to turn on your cameras.
25120	30640	The chat is open, so feel free to share your thoughts and ideas with the rest of the group
30640	32880	throughout this session.
32880	39040	And we do have closed captions available if that's how you prefer to view the session.
39040	42960	Finding the session is recorded for archival purposes and for you all, you should receive
42960	46080	the link in a few days.
46080	51920	So today we are honored to be joined by Michael Levin, who received a dual undergraduate
51920	57040	degree in computer science and biology, followed by PhD in molecular genetics from Harvard.
57040	62440	He did his postdoc training at Harvard Medical School and started his independent lab in
62440	63440	2000.
63440	68920	He is currently the Vannevar Bush Chair at the Tufts University, an associate faculty
68920	71920	member of the Vice Institute of Harvard.
71920	77240	He serves as the founding director of the Allen Discovery Center at Tufts.
77240	84320	His lab uses a mix of developmental biophysics, computer science, and behavior science to
84320	89560	understand the emergence of mind and unconventional embodiments at all scales, and to develop
89560	96040	interventions in regenerative medicine and application in synthetic bioengineering.
96040	102000	Today he will be talking to us about the collective intelligence of cells with morphogenesis, while
102000	107160	bioelectricity outside the brain means for understanding our multi-scale nature.
107160	109480	And with that, I'll pass it over to you, Michael.
109480	110480	Welcome.
110480	111480	Thank you so much.
111480	116240	I really appreciate the opportunity to share some ideas with you and to be part of this
116240	120520	event and some of the other speakers you've had, which were tremendous.
120520	122320	So let me see.
122320	123320	All right.
123320	124480	Can everybody see the slides?
124480	125480	Is it good?
125480	126480	Okay.
126480	127480	Yeah.
127480	131520	So if you're interested in this after the fact, you can find at this website here,
131520	136320	you can find all of the primary papers, the software, the data sets, everything, everything
136320	137320	is here.
137320	139160	And you can also get in touch with me here.
139160	144560	So today, what I'd like to transmit to you are some examples of the following main points.
144560	150080	I'm going to stress this idea that all intelligence is collective intelligence, and in particular,
150080	156600	the notion of scaling from the competencies of simple subunits to larger kinds of cognitive
156600	157600	systems.
157600	162080	We're going to talk about problem-solving in diverse and unconventional problem spaces,
162080	167720	and we're going to talk about the navigation of these virtual spaces as intelligence.
167720	170400	We'll talk about a kind of goal-directedness.
170400	174600	We'll talk about agency and unconventional embodiments.
174600	180360	And towards the end, this idea of universal hacking and of components of biological systems,
180360	185040	trying to manipulate the behavior of other systems, both above, below, and lateral to
185040	186040	them.
186160	191760	I'm going to spend about a third of the talk using anatomical control as an example of
191760	196840	a collective intelligence of cells navigating a particular kind of anatomical space.
196840	201400	And I'm going to show you lots of data on bioelectric networks as a kind of cognitive
201400	206200	glue that is the ancestor of brain function.
206200	212240	And we're going to talk about the impact that this is going to have on biomedicine.
212360	217920	Towards the end, I'm going to talk about some synthetic bioengineering and ways to think
217920	224480	about creating and then relating to novel types of beings, which has lots of implications
224480	227240	for science, for engineering, and for ethics.
227240	231200	So the talk is going to go in three parts, and what I'll do is, at the end of each part,
231200	236400	I'm going to pause, I'll take some questions, we'll take a break, people can get up and
236400	240320	stretch and get water and whatnot, and then we'll continue.
240320	247520	So the first part is going to be my efforts to break down some common categories and some
247520	250600	terminology that I think is really limiting the field.
250600	255480	And so for this reason, we're going to talk about stretching that into a kind of continuum
255480	259600	of various types of agents, and I want to show you some examples.
259600	266440	So this is, even though this is fairly, fairly a very old view, this is a famous painting
266440	270200	of Adam naming the animals in the Garden of Eden.
270200	274080	This is still actually quite prevalent in many, many relevant discussions.
274080	280520	What you see here is that there's a very sharp binary distinction between Adam here and the
280520	282040	rest of the animals.
282040	287800	So it's very clear that there are different kinds of creatures, fundamentally different
287800	288880	kinds.
288880	297920	But what we know now, because of Darwin and because of Von Baer, is that actually this
297920	302600	notion that there's some kind of a sharp binary category of being a human is actually
302600	309040	a smooth continuum, both on an evolutionary time scale, where if you slide back in evolutionary
309040	315760	time, you see a very gradual set of changes that go from that human all the way back to
315760	317880	a microbe and below that.
317880	323440	And of course, even on the life scale of the individual itself, you see we all start life
323440	329720	as a single cell, and then slowly and gradually we become what is basically considered to
329720	331640	be a standard human.
331640	336800	So we are at the center of this kind of continuum that stretches in two different timescales,
336800	342640	but it's actually even more complex than that, because now with bioengineering and various
342640	348800	other technologies, there are additional axes in this space where we can stretch the notion
348800	350440	of what a human actually is.
350440	355200	And you can imagine slowly adding various prosthetics, various technologies within the
355200	361400	body as is already happening, people who can control wheelchairs with their minds via implants
361400	362400	and things like this.
362400	368800	And of course, biological modifications that we can make both genetic and non-genetic.
368800	373720	And so we see here that and at every level of organization, cell tissue organism and
373720	382240	so on, we can replace native naturally evolved materials with all sorts of novel, either
382240	384760	natural or engineered materials.
384760	392560	And so we start to see that this notion of a standard human can be quite continuous in
392560	394240	a number of different dimensions.
394240	400360	And so I've been trying to develop a framework called TAME, and we'll talk about this more.
400360	403680	TAME stands for technological approach to mind everywhere.
403680	411880	And the idea is to be able to recognize, create, and relate to truly diverse intelligences,
411880	418040	not just the familiar creatures like us and maybe birds and dolphins and things, but also
418040	423520	really unusual creatures like colonial organisms and swarms and synthetic life forms that might
423520	431280	be engineered, software artificial intelligences, possible alien life if that's found.
431280	437240	So all of these things ought to be able to be handled by a mature science of diverse
437240	438400	intelligence.
438400	443400	And they have to be dealt with the same set of concepts regardless of what they're made
443400	449120	of, so regardless of their composition or origin story, meaning evolved versus engineered
449120	450720	or anything in between.
450720	453840	And of course, I'm not the first person to try for something like this.
453840	458480	So Rosenbluth, Wiener, and Bigelow did something like this.
458480	463520	In the 40s where they gave us this ladder, where you can see that all the way from basically
463520	469400	passive matter, all the way up through complex human metacognitive types of capacities, there
469400	472520	are a set of great transitions.
472520	475640	But nevertheless, these things are all on the same spectrum.
475640	482680	The idea was that we should be able to understand how various types of material implementations
482680	487000	can begin to have these kinds of functionalities.
487000	495120	And so one of the essential ways of thinking about these things in my framework has to do
495120	497560	with the relation of an observer.
497560	501760	And that observer might be an engineer, it might be another conspecific, it might be some
501760	507720	sort of a parasite or in fact, the evolutionary process itself, some sort of observer that
507720	511320	is able to modulate what the system is doing.
511320	516440	And so you can think about different ways of modulating a system depending on how sophisticated
516440	517440	it is.
517440	520800	So down here on this end of the spectrum, the only way you're going to make changes is
520800	523600	by engineering directly at the hardware level.
523600	527440	You're not going to convince a clock of anything, you're not going to reward and punish it.
527440	529760	All there is is mechanical engineering.
529760	534280	But you can cybernetics take this to things like this, these thermostats which have recorded
534280	535280	set points.
535280	539880	And so there you can do some interesting things such as modify the set point without rewiring
539880	544320	the hardware and get the system to take on a novel set of goals without having to rewire
544320	545320	it.
545320	549160	And then of course, more complex systems, availous of an interface involving rewards
549160	554200	and punishments and various other behavior shaping techniques where you can rely on the
554200	556560	system to learn from experience.
556560	560960	And then of course, we have even more, even more complex beings which are able to follow
560960	562320	logic and so on.
562320	567280	And so the difference in all of these different systems is not what they're made of or how
567280	572440	they got here, but it's what are the set of tools and techniques that you might use to
572440	576800	relate to that system all the way from physical rewiring to something that looks a lot more
576800	582040	like a psychoanalysis where you're literally trying to affect the model that the system
582040	584920	has of itself, of the outside world and so on.
584920	592400	So this shows you the kind of inclusive framework we're trying to make.
592400	597200	And the interesting thing is that all of us made this amazing journey across the Cartesian
597200	598200	cut.
598200	604000	We were all ones, so-called just physics, physics and chemistry, a little blob of protoplasm
604000	607360	and an unfertilized oocyte, quiescent.
607360	612280	And then through the process of embryonic development, we became one of these functional
612280	615560	creatures or even something like this.
615560	624960	And the crucial thing about this process of self-construction is that there is no magical
624960	630800	sort of sharp red line at which point you go from being just physics to being a true
630800	632120	cognitive being.
632120	636840	So many people would like to look at themselves and say, we have true, you name it, sentience,
636840	640240	cognition, intelligence, whatever term you want.
640240	644560	And then they would look at something like this, which is a little blob of chemicals.
644560	647040	And they say, well, that certainly doesn't have any of those things.
647040	651280	And so then you owe a story of how you got from here to there.
651280	656360	And that story cannot be any kind of a sharp change.
656360	662160	It has to be a gradual process that is in concert with what we know about embryonic development
662160	663660	and so on.
663660	664660	So that's interesting.
664660	669120	So we go from matter to mind in this way that I think developmental biology is maybe the
669440	671680	most magical of the sciences.
671680	674960	But at least we tend to think of ourselves, once we get here, we tend to think of ourselves
674960	679240	as some sort of a unified intelligence.
679240	684160	And in fact, we often, people will contrast the kinds of thing that we are with something
684160	689760	like ant colonies or bee swarms or something like that and say, well, we talk about that
689760	692640	as a collective intelligence, but that's a metaphor.
692640	696520	We are a true intelligence, collective intelligence is something else.
696520	699680	But actually, this is not the case.
699680	703880	And so Descartes, for example, was really interested in the pineal gland because he said that the
703880	710000	pineal gland was unique, it was an unpaired organ in the brain and therefore a kind of
710000	714480	a singular unified location for the mind to interact with the body.
714480	718160	But if he had had access to good microscopy, what he would have discovered is that there
718160	720360	isn't one of anything in the brain.
720360	724120	In fact, inside the pineal gland, you see this, which is a huge number of individual
724120	725440	cells.
726080	729680	If he had had this technology, he could have looked inside of any one of those cells and
729680	734040	discovered that they, in fact, are made of a huge number of different components and
734040	735440	various kinds of active matter.
735440	741520	So there are mitochondria, there are little motors that zip up and down various filaments,
741520	743760	just an incredible number of parts.
743760	747360	And so all of us are collective intelligences.
747360	753240	I'm not aware of any intelligence that is really just some sort of one indivisible diamond
753240	754560	of mind.
754560	757040	We are all made of parts of different kinds.
757040	759600	And so this is the sort of thing we're made of.
759600	762400	This is a single cell, it's called the lacrimaria.
762400	765640	This is a unicellular organism.
765640	768840	It has no brain, it has no nervous system, no stem cells.
768840	777120	It has remarkable competencies over its physiological, metabolic, and anatomical goals.
777120	782920	So you can see here that it's basically, this is at hunting in its environment.
782920	786800	If you're into soft-body robotics, this is an amazing design challenge.
786800	790760	We don't have anything remotely this competent.
790760	793800	And cells have all kinds of other interesting capabilities.
793800	797560	So this is the sort of thing that's studied in the field of diverse intelligence or basal
797560	798560	cognition.
798560	800680	I'll show you another example.
800680	802600	This is a slime mold.
802600	806560	So this slime mold, this is a unicellular slime mold called physarum polycephalum.
806560	809120	And we've put a little bit of it here on this petri dish.
809120	811240	We put one glass disc up here.
811240	813080	We put three glass discs back here.
813080	814080	They're just glass.
814080	815080	They're completely inert.
815080	816080	They're very thin.
816080	818880	They have no food or any kind of a chemical substance on them.
818880	823880	But what happens is that this, and by the way, this slime mold, it's a single cell.
823880	826200	It can be very large, but the whole thing is a single cell.
826200	830840	So what it starts to do is it starts to grow out, basically in every direction at once.
830840	836000	But during this time, during these 600 minutes or so, what it's actually doing as we discovered
836000	840600	is gently tugging on the material around it and reading the strain angle that comes
840600	841600	back.
841600	847120	And based on that strain angle, it builds up towards a decision of where the heavier
847120	848280	mass is.
848280	851720	And the way we know this is because reliably what it's going to do is grow towards the
851720	852960	heavier mass.
852960	857520	And so by reading that strain angle, it's able to gain some knowledge of its environment.
857520	862360	And then for some reason that we don't know, it prefers moving towards the heavier masses.
862360	868800	And so we see that we have this biological material that's very sort of ancient and early
868800	872160	in life has interesting capabilities.
872160	877040	And then the real question becomes, how do these things scale up?
877040	881480	What is it that allows combinations of these cells to do something like this?
881480	884760	So this is a very standard scenario.
884760	890920	The rat learns to press the lever to get the reward, and that's sort of very well understood.
890920	896600	But the interesting thing is that the rat is really a collection of cells, and no individual
896600	899000	cell has both experiences.
899000	902720	So there are cells on the foot of the rat that interact with the lever.
902720	908440	There are cells in the intestine that collect the nutritious reward sometime later.
908440	913000	But no individual cell has the experience of doing this and receiving that.
913000	918360	And so who is it that owns this kind of associative memory between two events that no individual
918360	919360	cell experienced?
919360	924160	So clearly, you need some sort of a, and the standard answer, of course, is the nervous
924160	929720	system provides this, you need some sort of way to integrate individual cellular activities
929720	931720	towards a single being.
931720	933600	Now this is kind of very common.
933600	939560	I want to show you some uncommon examples that people don't hear about a lot to kind
939560	942600	of stretch our idea of what's possible.
942600	949160	So this is a caterpillar, a soft-bodied kind of creature that crawls around and eats leaves,
949160	951320	and it has a certain kind of brain.
951320	955320	Remarkably, it transforms itself into a completely different kind of creature that now lives
955320	956680	in a three-dimensional world.
956680	960040	It flies, and it doesn't like leaves anymore.
960040	961040	It wants nectar.
961040	965000	And so a very different set of behaviors, very different set of preferences, very different
965000	966760	brain.
966760	970640	The brain is actually largely dissolved during this metamorphosis process.
970640	974600	The most of the synapses are broken, maybe most of the cells are killed, and a new brain
974600	975920	is reassembled.
975920	982560	But there's actually really good evidence that the memories that you impart onto the
982560	987560	caterpillar that you train, the moth or butterfly will actually retain those memories, and there's
987560	991840	work on this in beetles and various other creatures.
991840	993720	So you can think about two things.
993720	998960	The practical issue of, isn't it amazing to have a memory medium that can basically be
998960	1004320	taken apart and put back together and drastically rearranged and still retain its information
1004320	1005320	content?
1005320	1010480	Anything like that in computer science or anything like that.
1010480	1014360	And of course, it raises some philosophical, interesting philosophical questions, which
1014360	1019200	is, never mind the older question of what's it like to be a butterfly, the question could
1019200	1024120	be posed, what's it like to be a caterpillar slowly changing into a butterfly?
1024120	1028040	Because this is a change that happens not on an evolutionary time scale, but actually
1028040	1030880	during the lifetime of an active individual.
1030880	1038600	And so this ability to retain memory through very drastic deformations is really maximized
1038600	1041640	by this other system known as planarian flatworms.
1041640	1043880	We'll talk much more about that.
1043880	1050520	And these planarian flatworms, they can be trained, and if you train them, for example,
1050520	1056920	to recognize these little bumpy patterns as the place where they get fed, what you can
1056920	1062400	then do is amputate their head, which contains their brain.
1062400	1066840	You are left with a tail, the tail sits there doing nothing for about eight days.
1066840	1073080	It slowly regrows a brand new head and McConnell, who discovered this in the 60s and got a lot
1073080	1077720	of flak for it was actually completely correct in that these new animals with a brand new
1077720	1081200	brain still remember that original information.
1081200	1086480	And so what we have here is first evidence that information is not stored exclusively
1086480	1090760	in their centralized brain, but actually apparently spread throughout the body.
1090760	1098160	And you see this ability of those tissues to imprint that information onto the new brain
1098160	1099160	as it develops.
1099160	1103200	So this idea of information actually moving through body tissue.
1103200	1107160	And so you can think about, you know, there's this malfunctioning transporter experiment
1107160	1110560	from philosophy 101 where they say, well, there's this transporter.
1110560	1114680	And so what it does is you step into it and it destroys the original body and recreates
1114680	1116760	a molecule for molecule copy somewhere else.
1116760	1120600	And so now you've you've transported, but what if it malfunctions and it doesn't erase
1120600	1121600	the original copy?
1121600	1122600	How many of you are there?
1122600	1127080	Well, in Plenaria, you can literally do that because you can cut them into into pieces,
1127080	1131080	many pieces, and each piece becomes a perfect little little worm.
1131080	1137080	So so so we start to see that that, you know, kind of the common workhorses of behavioral
1137080	1141480	science and cognitive neuroscience or rats and things like this are just the tip of the
1141480	1142480	iceberg.
1142480	1147280	And there are many interesting phenomena that speak to this question of what are cells,
1147280	1153320	what are integrated beings, what what's information, how does it move through the body invertebrates.
1153320	1155600	You see this kind of interesting plasticity.
1155600	1159240	So this is a tappel of the frog, Xenopus labus.
1159240	1162520	And here are the nostrils, here's the brain, here's the gut.
1162520	1164600	And what you'll notice is that there aren't any eyes.
1164600	1166600	We prevented these eyes from forming.
1166600	1171000	But what we did do is graft a an eye primordium onto the tail.
1171000	1174280	And so these cells actually make a perfectly good eye.
1174280	1177920	And not only do they make an eye, but they make an optic nerve that optic nerve comes
1177920	1181640	out and you can see what it's doing here, it's it doesn't go to the brain, it stops
1181640	1184080	here at synapses onto the spinal cord.
1184080	1188960	And we made this machine that automates the training and testing of these animals and
1188960	1190840	visual cues.
1190840	1195920	So what so what we find is that they can see they can see quite well actually, and despite
1195920	1200960	the fact that they have a radically different sensory motor architecture, it does not require
1201160	1203680	evolutionary adaptation time.
1203680	1209360	This happens immediately in one in one lifetime of a single tappel, and they can do perfectly
1209360	1213880	well with a completely different kind of connection between their sense organs and their brain.
1213880	1220200	And this this kind of thing has massive implications for evolution, too, because some, for example,
1220200	1225040	a mutation that causes their their eye to be to be pushed off doesn't immediately get
1225040	1230560	weeded out because the animals can't see and die, but rather these animals, the behavior
1230640	1231480	is quite robust.
1231480	1235880	And so the evolution is free to explore any other consequence of that same mutation.
1235880	1242400	It really buffers this this competency really buffers the negative consequences of of mutations.
1243120	1249000	So what we see the reason the reason that all of this plasticity works is that biology
1249240	1254440	is built on this kind of multi scale competency architecture where all the way from molecular
1254440	1258400	networks, cellular networks of tissues and organs and so on.
1259040	1264920	Every level here is not merely a structural set of nested dolls, but is actually a functional
1264920	1265880	problem solver.
1265880	1269120	In other words, they are competent, they have competencies in specific spaces.
1269360	1272720	This might be the space of gene expression or transcriptional space.
1272920	1274720	This might be physiological space.
1274720	1277680	This might be familiar three dimensional behavioral space and so on.
1278360	1283040	And so each of these levels solves various problems at various degrees of sophistication.
1283440	1290000	And so what I'd like to do is really expand from from this notion that behavior takes
1290000	1296880	place in three dimensional space and and and understand that that to biology, all kinds
1296880	1302920	of other spaces that we are not good at perceiving and thinking about those are equally valid
1303160	1304280	problem spaces.
1304280	1310280	So we this this this familiar space of behavior, we are very good at recognizing
1310640	1316600	intelligence when medium sized beings moving at medium speeds through three dimensional
1316600	1319560	space are doing clever things and we and we recognize that right away.
1320320	1323640	But there are these other spaces that we are not good at, for example, gene expression
1323640	1325080	space and physiological space.
1325360	1331200	I think that if we had a built in kind of innate ability to feel our blood chemistry,
1331200	1336360	for example, if we had sensors sensors pointing inwards, not just not just outwards, I think
1336360	1340840	we would have no trouble recognizing our liver and our kidneys as intelligent beings
1340840	1345120	navigating physiological problem space and solving various problems, the way that we
1345120	1346800	recognize other animals doing it.
1347200	1352440	And so I'm going to spend the most of the time in the next section talking about this
1352440	1354720	problem solving in this anatomical morphospace.
1355000	1359520	But I just want to show you one interesting example of a different kind of space called
1359520	1360640	physiological space.
1361080	1364800	So here's here's an experiment we we showed a couple of years ago.
1365080	1366360	So so here's a flatworm.
1366360	1369360	You put these flatworms in a solution of barium.
1369640	1372920	Now, barium is a nonspecific potassium channel blocker.
1372920	1376880	So what it does is it blocks the ability of the cells to swap potassium in and out.
1377960	1382000	The cells are very unhappy, especially the cells in the head, because all these neurons
1382000	1386280	like to flow potassium in order to keep their physiology correct.
1386520	1390600	And so what happens is their heads explode literally overnight, their heads, their heads
1390600	1391600	degenerate.
1391640	1395040	But the amazing thing is that if you leave them in barium within a couple of weeks,
1395240	1398800	they grow back a new head and the new head doesn't care about barium at all.
1398880	1400600	No problem. It's barium adapted.
1400600	1402640	So we asked we asked a simple question.
1403160	1404880	What is different transcriptionally?
1404880	1408880	What genes do these barium adapted heads express that the standard heads do not
1408880	1411920	express? And what we found out is that there's very small number on the order of
1411920	1416880	about a dozen genes that are that are changed here to go to become barium adapted.
1417120	1419200	Now, here's the here's the kicker to all of this.
1419840	1421960	Plenaria never see barium in the wild.
1422200	1427280	This barium doesn't exist in nature in the way that the way that we used it here.
1427440	1431240	And so there's never been evolutionary pressure for Plenaria to know what to do
1431240	1434080	when they've been exposed to this incredible stressor.
1434520	1439520	So when you think about how they found these few
1439960	1443120	correct genes out of a sea of tens of thousands of other genes,
1443760	1448160	it's a little bit like I visualize it like sitting in a in a nuclear reactor
1448160	1450320	control room and things melting down.
1451120	1453480	So you have this this very strong physiological stressor,
1453640	1456400	which you don't have time to do is to start randomly flipping buttons.
1456640	1459000	And so because not not only because there's no time for that,
1459000	1462720	it's the combinations are astronomical, but also because
1463400	1466520	because many of the things you do this way are going to kill the cell
1466520	1471440	along before you find the the barium adaptation region of that space.
1471440	1477200	So so it's so it's a surge of a roughly 20,000 dimensional space
1477440	1481000	to find a new region of that space that solves your problem.
1481000	1484480	This is this is absolutely a kind of navigating problem solving
1484480	1486720	that we really do not understand how this works.
1486720	1488520	But this is an example of what I mean.
1488520	1493160	And I think that what evolution does is pivot some of the same
1493920	1496360	mechanisms and some of the same tricks and the same problem
1496600	1500640	problems, problem solving strategies through various spaces,
1500640	1504040	including very early life, I have to solve metabolic problems
1504200	1507400	and then and then some physiological problems and then gene expression
1507400	1509280	and then anatomical morphous space.
1509280	1513200	And of course, 3D behavioral space once brains and muscles showed up
1513400	1516520	and then linguistic space and who knows who knows what else.
1517080	1522800	So what evolution does is is is is pivot organisms through these various spaces.
1522800	1525320	And of course, even the distinction between these spaces
1525320	1528440	is completely arbitrary relative to us and as an observer.
1528760	1530880	So as, for example, Chris Fields points out,
1531240	1536080	if you are a bacterium sitting in a in the concentration gradient
1536080	1539840	of some nutrient, you could move in three dimensional space
1539840	1544360	to try to go up up the gradient, or you could move in transcriptional space,
1544560	1547680	turn on some other gene that would let you instead metabolize
1548080	1551800	some other kind of molecule that's in that space and solve your problem that way.
1551800	1555760	So to the to the bacterium, it will not see a clean separation
1555760	1558000	between three dimensional space and transcriptional space.
1558240	1559880	All of these things are effectors.
1559880	1564440	All of these things are moves that it can make in its various spaces to solve problems.
1565360	1570760	OK, so let's so let's take a break here before we go on to the next section.
1571640	1576440	And I'll pause and and if anybody has questions, I'm happy to happy to talk about it.
1578440	1581520	Oh, how long would you like this this break to be?
1582720	1586200	Um, let's take let's take maybe five minutes, five minutes.
1586440	1588040	Yeah, if people have questions, great.
1588040	1590240	And if not, just take five minutes and get some water.
1590800	1594920	Yeah, if you do have any question, you can use the raise your hand function
1594920	1598320	or or just come in if if I don't see you.
1599360	1601120	I see that Gary has.
1602560	1604320	He's had a couple of questions there in the chat.
1604320	1606760	I don't know if he wants to come in and ask his questions.
1608320	1610760	Gary, let me unmute. Can you hear me?
1611320	1614320	We can. OK.
1615280	1620080	Well, first of all, I think your work is just amazing and magnificent.
1620440	1622440	And it's
1623480	1628320	I just love the idea of a plenarium, you know, regenerating its head.
1628320	1631480	I mean, that that you showed that McConnell was right about what he.
1631960	1634800	So here's the thing.
1634800	1639680	Does what you are seeing suggest the possibility
1640680	1646160	that panpsychism is what is driving the material adaptation,
1647040	1651720	that there is a fundamental consciousness
1652400	1659040	that, you know, that then drives the adaptation of the of the material elements.
1659560	1662560	Yeah, so there are no, please keep keep going.
1662960	1666480	No, and the concept of also of semiotic freedom,
1666920	1670600	which Jesper Hoffmeyer has talked about, which is the idea that
1671240	1676200	that evolution favors the capacity to communicate, right?
1676440	1683240	That that the more sophisticated the communication can be that integrates, right?
1683480	1687680	The species within its body, but also within its
1688000	1690440	conspecifics, right, within its community,
1692360	1694640	which might explain why we're here.
1694720	1697280	Yeah. Yeah, yeah, great, great questions.
1697280	1698520	Thank you.
1698520	1702760	There are to me, there are two different dimensions to this to this question.
1703280	1706360	One is overall the concept of panpsychism.
1706360	1709200	And I think what wait, if you would wait till the very end,
1709200	1711560	and we'll talk about this after the third part.
1711840	1715880	But the other interesting part you said is is about the driving of evolution.
1716200	1719960	So so I'll just I'll just say one one one thing about it here,
1720280	1728080	which is that if you think about the kind of pre Darwinian notion of
1728520	1731880	what what people call whether they associate this with with Lamarck, most of all,
1731880	1736880	but this idea that that evolutionary change is not random with respect to outcome
1737040	1741560	that basically by stretching, you know, his neck, the giraffe has children with longer necks.
1741560	1748040	OK, the problem with the up until 2018,
1748400	1750480	I would have said that I would have said the following.
1751160	1754840	The reason that Lamarckism is a strong Lamarckism, of course, of course,
1754840	1759720	and there's some some mechanisms for for epigenetic inheritance and so on.
1759720	1763000	But the reason that strong Lamarckism is impossible is has nothing to do
1763000	1765280	with Weissman's barrier or setting aside the germline.
1765280	1766640	All of that is completely porous.
1766640	1769680	People have shown that that doesn't stop any man that that's that's easy.
1770000	1773400	The hard part and prior to 2018, I would have said impossible
1773840	1778240	is that the real problem is that genes don't encode specific characters.
1778240	1779960	In other words, there's no gene for neck length.
1779960	1784000	And so if you wanted a longer neck, you have to solve this inverse problem
1784000	1787280	of which genes do you mutate to have a longer neck?
1787280	1789800	It's, you know, it's it's an it's an impossible inverse problem.
1789800	1791360	So I would have said that's impossible.
1791360	1795520	However, looking at this looking at this barium experiment,
1795880	1799520	what we see here is that the cells have basically done the hardest part.
1799680	1804040	They have identified which which genetic loci are relevant to the new problem
1804040	1804880	they're facing.
1804880	1808440	Once you've identified which those are mutating them by some kind of crisper
1808720	1811680	type of mechanism or some kind of genomic editing mechanism, that's trivial.
1811680	1815080	There are lots of lots of organisms to edit their genomes in various ways.
1815520	1816800	Once you know which genes.
1816800	1821040	And so, you know, now I have a slightly different view on it to say that
1821200	1825640	I don't know how they do it, but we do have some evidence that cells can infer
1825640	1829760	which genes are responsible for specific adaptive outcomes.
1830080	1833160	And if that's the case, I'm no longer sure that it's impossible
1833160	1835960	that that to some extent they're driving the evolutionary change.
1836160	1839720	Because once you and again, this is a very, of course, this is a very controversial area.
1839840	1843680	I have not, you know, remotely enough evidence yet to prove that that's
1844080	1848080	that that has implications on a on a global evolutionary trajectory scale.
1848240	1852480	But I no longer think it's impossible because we can see cells solving this inverse problem.
1853080	1856880	I mean, it suggests that there's some form of entanglement, right?
1856880	1861400	I mean, which is which we know is true in quantum physics.
1863000	1866800	Even though, you know, we don't have a material way of explaining it.
1869200	1873720	That is that the that the problem solving element is not is not necessarily based
1873720	1880600	on the materiality of the genome adapting, but that there's some kind of
1880600	1886000	an influence that comes from the functional need to survive, right?
1886000	1891880	To, you know, to to change itself so that it can sustain itself
1892480	1895120	as a living creature in a barium solution.
1896720	1897520	Yeah. Yeah.
1897520	1900120	I mean, so I haven't shown you anything yet.
1900120	1904000	There are some things coming that that may relate to this, but I haven't shown you
1904000	1908560	anything yet that suggests that the solution has to be any kind of exorbitant.
1908560	1912760	But the solution has to be any kind of exotic, you know, physics or anything
1912760	1916960	like that, right? Because because for now, for the next for the whole next section,
1916960	1922040	which we should start in a few minutes, what you'll see is that there's a tremendous
1922040	1925920	amount of intelligent problem solving that can be squeezed out of a perfectly
1925920	1929000	conventional set of mechanisms, not to say that there aren't others.
1929240	1933240	But but we haven't yet, I think, come to the point where we need to invoke
1933240	1934400	anything more, more exotic.
1934400	1936280	But, you know, we'll see.
1936280	1937680	OK. Thank you.
1937720	1940880	You, Gary, there are a few more questions, Mike.
1940880	1942360	Are you happy to take them?
1942360	1944600	Let's yeah, let's do let's do let's say one more.
1944600	1947840	And then and then, you know, at the end, I'll stay as long as people want afterwards.
1947840	1950400	But, you know, let's we'll move on to the second section.
1950400	1951400	Thank you.
1951400	1954520	Beth, do you have a question?
1954520	1955880	Yes.
1955880	1959360	And like Gary, I want to just say this is this absolutely fascinating.
1959680	1962120	But unlike Gary, I'm not a scientist.
1962120	1964240	So this is probably naive.
1964320	1968080	I'm trying to bring together an idea from the very first of what you said
1968520	1969760	and what you said at the end.
1969760	1973480	And that has to do with the scale and the continuum.
1974720	1978800	I'm curious, you know, thinking about human beings or higher critters
1979320	1982800	that we have an awful lot of diverse things within us.
1982800	1987560	And I'm just curious if we don't have a lot of that
1987960	1992680	what you call the physical space, the continuum that goes across time,
1992680	1994800	the evolutionary time.
1994800	2001000	We must be just a polyglot of different levels of evolutionary development.
2001200	2002480	Is that so?
2002480	2006840	Yes, yes, you've you've anticipated a chunk of the third part of the talk.
2006840	2008720	Yeah, you stay tuned.
2008720	2011280	That's coming. You are 100 percent on the money there.
2011440	2013560	Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, it's coming.
2014080	2017200	OK, so yeah, let me let me move on to the second part.
2017200	2020680	And then we will, well, you know, we can come back to any of this.
2020920	2024360	So the second the second thing that I want to talk about is to really give you
2024360	2030480	an example, a very concrete example of a of an unconventional
2030480	2033800	collective intelligence of a of a of a problem solving system
2033800	2037280	that doesn't look like what we're used to thinking about as intelligent systems.
2037520	2039080	And what we're going to use for that example
2039080	2043280	is is the distributed collective intelligence of cells
2043280	2045040	as they undergo morphogenesis.
2045040	2047160	And then specifically, we'll talk about bio electricity.
2048000	2051480	So let's I like to start by noticing this interesting thing.
2051480	2054280	So so Alan Turing obviously needs no introduction,
2054560	2057600	kind of the father of computer science and some other things.
2058080	2061720	And he was interested in intelligence and intelligence
2061720	2064920	in novel embodiments that are not natural
2065200	2067560	and computation and things like this.
2067560	2069840	And so he was interested in problem solving machines,
2070040	2072560	and in particular, the notion of reprogrammability
2072560	2075720	or intelligence through a kind of plasticity.
2076720	2079080	Interesting. And so and so he, you know,
2079080	2081440	he wrote these foundational papers and computer science.
2081760	2085000	But interestingly, he also wrote a paper on this
2085000	2087000	on the chemical basis of morphogenesis.
2087000	2091680	So the question he was addressing is how can biological order
2091720	2096240	or at least in this case, biochemical order arise spontaneously?
2096440	2100760	And so you might wonder why would somebody who is interested in computing
2100760	2104040	and mathematics and machines, machine intelligence,
2104280	2106960	why would he be thinking about chemical morphogenesis
2106960	2108760	and embryos and things like this?
2108760	2111200	And I think that like with many things,
2111200	2112960	this is just an example of Turing's genius.
2112960	2116640	I think he saw very clearly that these are fundamentally the same problem.
2116640	2118680	And I'm going to argue that that's true,
2118680	2122520	although he didn't write much, if anything, about this that I know of.
2122520	2126640	But I think he was onto this idea that the formation of the mind
2126640	2129360	and the formation of the body are fundamentally the same problem.
2129360	2132520	And so let me take you on a little tour of some of that.
2132960	2134440	So let's let's ask this question.
2134440	2138040	This is a this is a cross section through a human torso.
2139440	2142280	Look at look at the amazing order here, right?
2142280	2146080	So all the organs, the cells, the tissues, everything is in the right
2146080	2149720	the right size, the right shape or next to the right thing oriented in the right direction.
2150840	2155080	And it all comes from a collection of embryonic blastomeres during development.
2155080	2156360	And it's a self assembly.
2156360	2159080	Where does this particular pattern come from?
2159320	2163560	Now, the kind of immediate answer that most people give, well, it's in the DNA.
2163560	2165040	It's in the genome.
2165040	2168440	And we're going to come back to this with a vengeance in the third part of the talk.
2168440	2173960	But I want to point out already here that that is kind of an untenable answer
2173960	2178520	because we can read genomes now and we know what what genomes encode.
2178520	2179840	They encode proteins.
2179840	2182680	They don't specifically encode three dimensional shapes.
2182680	2186680	They encode the tiny hardware that every cell gets to have.
2186680	2191080	And so there's still this this this massive question of using that hardware.
2191080	2194600	How does the physiology of this cellular machine
2195960	2198920	make this particular pattern and not some other pattern?
2198920	2203400	And the thing is that the structure of the human body is no more directly in the genome
2203400	2209000	than the structure of a termite nest or the shape of a spider web is in the genomes of the
2209000	2212200	of the termites or the spider web.
2212200	2217960	It's an emergent construction project of the collective intelligence of these cells.
2217960	2219880	And so we can ask interesting questions.
2219880	2222920	How do these cells know what to make and when to stop?
2222920	2227080	And then for the third part of the talk, we'll talk about what else is possible
2227080	2229880	as an as a regenerative medicine worker.
2229880	2234760	We'd like to know if a part is damaged or missing, how do we get the cells to rebuild it?
2234760	2238440	And as an engineer, we'd like to go one step further and say, OK, but can we get these cells
2238440	2241560	to build something completely different, something that's not like this at all?
2241560	2247320	And to think about, I like to sort of think all the way forward so that we know where we're going.
2247320	2249800	Let's think about what is the end game of this field?
2249800	2253800	You know, when can we all basically say we're done and go home?
2253800	2259400	And the way I envision this is as something called an anatomical compiler.
2259400	2263160	So just imagine at some point in the future, you're going to be able to sit down in front
2263160	2267640	of a computer and draw the plant or animal that you want.
2267640	2269560	It could be something that already exists.
2269560	2272040	It could be some organ that you need for transplantation.
2272040	2275480	It could be some completely different thing, you know, some sort of a six-legged frog
2275480	2276840	with a little propeller on its head.
2276840	2277560	It could be anything.
2277560	2280120	The point is it could be absolutely anything.
2280120	2283560	And if we had a mature science of this, if we knew what we were doing,
2283560	2288760	this anatomical compiler would output a set of stimuli that would have to be given to cells
2288760	2293000	to get them to build whatever you drew, like in this case, this three-headed flatwork.
2293000	2295480	And so the idea, this is not a 3D printer.
2295480	2301800	This is not something that meticulously micromanages the position of cells to print what you want.
2301800	2303800	This is a communications device.
2303800	2306600	What it does is it's a translator, really.
2306600	2312360	It translates from your anatomical goals to the anatomical goals of a collection of cells,
2312360	2315480	which are encoded in a different medium, which I'll show you momentarily.
2316280	2324040	And by doing that, it basically resets the target morphology of these cells
2324040	2326680	and gets them to build whatever it is that you want them to build.
2326680	2328200	And I'll show you some examples of that.
2328200	2332440	But of course, we don't have anything remotely this sophisticated.
2332440	2334920	We can only do this in a very small number of cases.
2334920	2336360	Now, why is this important?
2336360	2342280	Well, aside from the very fundamental aspect that we need this to understand how evolution works,
2342280	2348840	we needed to understand our origins, and so on, this is the answer to most medical problems,
2348840	2351080	with the exception of infectious disease.
2351080	2354680	If you could communicate your goals to a collection of cells,
2354680	2357320	you would immediately have the solution to birth defects.
2357320	2359160	You could regenerate after traumatic injury.
2359160	2360840	You could reprogram and cancer.
2360840	2361960	You could suppress aging.
2361960	2366840	You could solve degenerative disease.
2366840	2369000	All of these things boil down to one problem.
2369000	2371320	How do we tell a collection of cells what to build?
2371320	2373400	If you knew that, all of these problems would go away.
2373400	2375800	So this is a major unmet need.
2375800	2377320	Why do we not have something like this?
2377400	2382680	I mean, genetics and molecular biology have been working really hard for many decades now.
2382680	2384360	Why do we not still have this?
2384360	2386840	I want to show just a simple example.
2388040	2392200	This is a baby axolotl, and axolotl larvae have little forelegs.
2392200	2397640	And this is a tadpole of a frog, and these guys do not have forelegs.
2397640	2400280	And so in my lab, we can make something called a frogolotl,
2400280	2403880	which basically just means you take a bunch of cells from an early axolotl.
2403880	2405880	You take a bunch of cells from the early frog.
2405960	2408120	You put them together, and you got a chimeric embryo
2408120	2410680	that has some cells from here and some cells from there.
2411400	2413640	Now, we have both genomes.
2413640	2417240	We've sequenced the axolotl genome, and we've sequenced the frog genome.
2417240	2419160	Can anybody tell me, looking at those genomes,
2419160	2421800	whether frogolotls are going to have legs or not?
2421800	2422600	And the answer is no.
2422600	2423720	No one can tell you that.
2423720	2430360	And that is because while we do have some good frameworks for understanding
2430360	2435240	what a single cell is going to do biochemically by looking at its genome,
2435240	2438520	we have almost no ability to look at a genome
2438520	2440680	and guess what the collective is going to do.
2440680	2442360	Either a pure collective like this,
2442360	2445960	I mean, you can't even predict the shape of a single animal from its genome either,
2445960	2448280	but certainly not in these chimeric cases.
2448280	2452760	What we do not understand yet, despite all the biochemistry and genomics and everything else,
2452760	2455240	what we don't understand yet is collective decision-making.
2455240	2457880	We do not understand how cells with specific hardware
2457880	2460360	make decisions about large-scale shape.
2460360	2462360	And so here's where we are today.
2462360	2466920	We're very good at manipulating molecules in cells and making networks and so on,
2466920	2469800	but we're really a long way from form and function.
2469800	2473240	And I'm going to argue that from controlling large-scale form and function.
2473240	2474920	And I'm going to argue that the reason for this,
2474920	2478840	and the thing that holds back really radically transformative regenerative medicine,
2479480	2484360	is that all of molecular medicine today is roughly like this.
2484360	2487640	This is what programming looked like in the 40s and 50s.
2487640	2489240	I mean, you can see what she's doing.
2489240	2493960	She's literally rewiring the machine by pulling wires in and out.
2493960	2495480	This is hardware control.
2495480	2499080	Now, the reason that you don't get out your soldering iron
2499080	2503560	when it's time to go from Microsoft Word to Photoshop on your laptop
2503560	2507800	is that what computer science has figured out is that there are higher-level
2508680	2512680	ways to interact with the system that does not require you to rewire the hardware,
2512680	2518280	meaning that you're taking advantage of the inherent plasticity competencies
2518280	2522200	and various other capacities in the software of the system,
2522200	2525640	in the activity of the system that you can guide with stimuli,
2525640	2529000	with signals such as hitting a keyboard in the case of the computer.
2529000	2531720	And that's what gave us the information technology revolution.
2531720	2537000	Biology, to a large extent, is still here because all of the exciting technology,
2537000	2541400	so genome editing, CRISPR, protein engineering, single molecule approaches,
2541400	2543160	all of it is down at the level of the hardware.
2543160	2545000	All the excitement is at the level of hardware.
2545000	2549320	We haven't even begun to scratch the surface of what the actual biological
2549320	2554920	software can do specifically, the intelligence of the various biological components.
2554920	2557400	Now, what do I mean by, when I say intelligence?
2557400	2558360	There are many definitions.
2558360	2559080	I like this one.
2559720	2564840	This is William James, who gave us a strikingly prescient definition of intelligence.
2565560	2568600	It's very good because it doesn't say anything about brains or what you're made of
2568600	2569640	or anything like that.
2569640	2571080	It's very cybernetic.
2571080	2574920	It says this, intelligence is some degree of the ability
2575320	2577880	to reach the same goal by different means.
2577880	2578600	That's it.
2578600	2581320	So in order to estimate the intelligence of some system,
2581320	2584600	whether it's engineered or biological or hybrid,
2584600	2586280	you have to, it's an empirical question.
2586280	2588120	You have to name a space that it works in.
2588120	2590040	You have to say what you think the goal is.
2590040	2593080	You have to make a claim about what you think the competencies of the system
2593080	2595640	to reach that goal, despite perturbations.
2595640	2598440	That's the key is that it's a, you need to do interventions.
2598440	2601480	You can't say how intelligent something is by simply observing it.
2601480	2605400	You have to do perturbative experiments to see what goes on
2605400	2608040	and what it can do to achieve its goal.
2608040	2610520	And in particular, James gives a very nice example,
2610520	2615240	which is the spectrum between two magnets trying to get together
2615240	2617960	and Romeo and Juliet trying to get together.
2617960	2619720	And the difference is very simple.
2619720	2620920	And there's many things in between.
2620920	2624440	If you've got two magnets, they have some competency to try and meet each other.
2624440	2627400	But if you put a piece of wood in their way, that's it.
2627400	2629000	They're going to stand there pressed up against it.
2629000	2631160	They have no ability to go around or do anything else.
2631160	2633320	So that's sort of the minimal competency.
2633320	2635560	Romeo and Juliet have massive competencies
2635560	2639240	to go around various physical and social barriers to get what they want.
2639240	2644840	And in between, there are all sorts of self-driving vehicles, worms and cells
2644840	2649240	and different kinds of creatures that have different degrees of competency
2649240	2650840	to reach various goals.
2650840	2652520	So let's talk about this then.
2652520	2654360	If that's the definition of intelligence,
2655160	2659000	let's ask what kind of collective intelligence do these cellular swarms deploy?
2659000	2663560	I've made this argument that the cells of the body making in embryo
2663560	2665080	are a kind of collective intelligence.
2665800	2670600	I'm not simply saying that they have a complex outcome.
2670600	2674120	Feed forward emergence of complexity from simple rules is commonplace.
2674120	2675000	Many systems do that.
2675000	2675880	That's not what I mean.
2675880	2679960	They have a specific ability to adapt to perturbations.
2679960	2682200	That's more than simple emergence.
2682200	2683800	And let me show you some examples.
2683800	2690840	So development is quite reliable and has the ability to reach the specific region
2690840	2695560	of the anatomical amorphous space, meaning the various different configurations
2695560	2698040	that a body might have to go from here to here.
2698040	2702760	So you go from a single cell and then two cells to a whole body.
2702760	2707240	But the amazing thing is that if you cut this embryo in half,
2707240	2709160	you don't get two half bodies.
2709160	2712200	You get two perfectly normal monosygotic twins.
2712200	2714840	So this system is reliable, but it is not hardwired.
2714840	2719640	In the face of this massive perturbation, it is able to still get to where it's going.
2719640	2723400	So if you boil everything down to two dimensions, just for sake of illustration,
2723400	2727320	the normal embryo does this, but the embryo cut in half,
2727320	2729480	which is in a different location in that space,
2729480	2731480	actually is able to get to where it needs to go.
2731480	2734040	In this ensemble of states, this is the goal space.
2734040	2738920	The goal states in that space, this is what are considered standard human anatomies are.
2739560	2741480	And there are various other ways to get there.
2741480	2744840	And there are local maxima that can be avoided and so on.
2744840	2749320	So being able to navigate to the same region from different starting conditions
2749320	2753880	is a kind of intelligence that we view as navigation.
2753880	2757160	Here is an example in an adult organism.
2757800	2759400	This is an axolotl.
2759400	2760840	So this is a salamander.
2760840	2766360	This guy regenerates his limbs, his eyes, jaws, portions of the heart and brain,
2766360	2769720	spinal cord, ovaries, amazingly regenerative.
2769720	2774600	What happens is that when a limb is amputated and they bite each other's legs off all the time
2774600	2775800	when they're when they're housed together.
2775800	2780440	So this is a natural experiment that happens, whether it's here or here or up here,
2780440	2783480	the cells will very rapidly build what's needed.
2783480	2786920	And they make a standard salamander leg and then they stop.
2786920	2791320	That's the most amazing part of regeneration that first of all,
2791320	2794680	that it happens exactly the same way no matter what, where you start from.
2794680	2796280	And second, that it knows when to stop.
2796840	2797640	When does it stop?
2797640	2800440	It stops when the correct salamander arm has been completed.
2800440	2803320	So you can see that what this is is an error minimization scheme.
2803320	2808440	This is a system that is going to keep working and changing until a large scale
2808440	2811880	set point of target morphology that looks like this has been reached.
2811880	2814600	Now, by the way, this is not just for frogs and worms.
2816360	2817480	There are some examples.
2817480	2820760	So for example, the human liver is highly regenerative.
2820760	2822040	Even the ancient Greeks knew that.
2822040	2824120	I have no idea how they knew that, but they did.
2825400	2827400	Human children can regenerate their fingertips.
2827400	2830920	So below a certain age, they will have a cosmetically very, very nice
2830920	2833240	regeneration of a fingertip amputation.
2833240	2838200	And deer are a large adult mammal that regenerates a centimeter and a half
2838200	2840360	of new bone per day when they're growing this.
2840360	2844680	So bone, vasculature, innervation, skin, all of it.
2844680	2848280	So this ability, and in fact, in the correct pattern.
2848280	2852760	So this ability to regenerate is sprinkled throughout the tree of life.
2852760	2854120	It is really fundamental.
2854200	2859480	I want to show you one of my maybe all-time examples of creative problem
2859480	2861880	solving in this kind of space.
2862520	2867160	So in that salamander that I showed you, in the nude, if you take a section
2867160	2871160	through a little tubule that goes to the kidney, you see that it's like
2871160	2876520	eight or 10 cells typically that work together to make this lumen.
2876520	2880600	One trick you can do is you can make the cells large.
2880600	2882680	You can force the cells to be larger.
2882680	2887720	And if you do that, what happens is it adjusts fewer, fewer of those cells
2887720	2891160	are there to make the same, roughly the same size of lumen.
2891160	2895160	That's already amazing that it adjusts the number of cells to the size of each cell.
2897320	2903000	And that, you know, to being a new born into this world, the embryo cannot
2903000	2905640	count on having the right size of cells.
2905640	2907720	It has to adapt on the fly.
2907720	2910200	This is one of many things you can't count on as an embryo.
2910200	2913240	You have to solve these problems from scratch every time.
2913240	2915400	So what it'll do is it'll use the right number of cells.
2915400	2921000	But if you make the cells truly gigantic, one single cell will bend around itself
2921000	2923640	and leave a space in the middle to give you that tubule.
2923640	2926680	What's amazing about this is that this is a completely different molecular
2926680	2927800	mechanism than this.
2927800	2931480	In other words, this is some sort of cell-to-cell communication tubulogenesis
2931480	2932120	kind of a thing.
2932120	2933720	This is cytoskeletal bending.
2933720	2935720	This is a single cell bending around itself.
2935720	2936840	So look what's going on here.
2936840	2941320	Different molecular mechanisms are being called up in the service
2941320	2943240	of a high-level anatomical goal.
2943240	2945880	This is what's known as top-down causation.
2945880	2950200	In the service of a particular anatomical goal, different molecular mechanisms
2950200	2953720	can be called up.
2953720	2958760	So this ability to adjust to circumstance has to do with external circumstances,
2958760	2961400	like being injured or being cut in half or losing a limb,
2961400	2963240	but also internal circumstances.
2963240	2966200	Not only can't you count on your body maintaining a particular shape,
2966200	2967720	you can't even count on your own parts.
2967720	2970680	You have no idea what size your cells are going to be when you come into the world
2970680	2972680	and you still have to be able to solve this problem.
2972680	2974600	So this is amazing.
2974600	2977560	And again, not through eons of evolutionary change.
2977560	2980600	This happens immediately in one generation.
2981240	2986120	So the final example I want to show you is something that we discovered a few years ago.
2987400	2989320	Here's a normal tappel here.
2989320	2992920	The eyes, the brain, the nostrils, and the mouth is here.
2992920	2995640	So these tappels have to become a fraud
2995640	2996920	in order to become a fraud.
2996920	2998200	They have to rearrange their face.
2998200	2999400	So the jaws have to move forward.
2999400	3001480	The eyes have to come in various things like that.
3002040	3004920	And it was thought that this is a hard-wired process.
3004920	3009560	Basically, every organ in the face moves in a certain direction, a certain amount.
3009560	3013160	And that way, if you just know which direction
3013160	3016120	and how much you'll go from a standard tappel to a standard fraud.
3016120	3020040	We made the hypothesis that this was actually a more intelligent process than that.
3020040	3022200	And so how do you test it with perturbation?
3022200	3025080	So what we did was we created what we call Picasso tappels.
3025080	3027720	So the eye is off to the side.
3027720	3028920	The jaws are on top of the head.
3028920	3031560	Everything is kind of scrambled.
3031560	3036040	And what we found is that even those animals generally make pretty normal frogs.
3036040	3040360	Because all of these organs move in novel unnatural paths
3040360	3042520	to get to where they're going and then they stop.
3042520	3043880	Actually, they sometimes overshoot.
3043880	3045800	They sometimes go too far and then have to come back.
3045800	3050680	But all of these things move around until they get to a pretty normal frog face.
3050680	3057000	So what this is, is this idea that genetics isn't specifying some kind of hardware rearrangement,
3057000	3058440	hard-wired rearrangements.
3058440	3061480	What it actually specifies is a problem-solving machine,
3061480	3063560	and we'll get to more of this in the third part of the talk,
3064360	3068280	that can recognize unexpected states and take corrective action.
3068280	3070040	It's an error minimization scheme.
3070760	3072280	So how might that work?
3072280	3075240	And here's what we have.
3075240	3078440	The standard story of developmental biology looks like this.
3078440	3081720	There are genes that interact with each other as gene-regulatory networks.
3081720	3083800	They make proteins, which do things.
3083800	3084680	Some of them are sticky.
3084680	3085560	Some of them diffuse.
3085560	3087000	Some of them exert force and so on.
3087560	3089880	And then there's this process of emergence.
3089880	3091880	So simple rules lead to complex outcomes,
3091880	3094360	and you get this kind of beautiful anatomy.
3094360	3095320	And this is all true.
3095320	3096360	This all happens.
3096360	3102200	But this leaves out a really critical component, which this is all feed-forward emergence.
3102200	3107640	But there are all these feedback loops that if you step away from this target morphology,
3107720	3113480	either by injury or by teratogens or by mutations or anything else,
3114360	3117560	all kinds of processes at the level of physics and genetics get activated
3117560	3118920	to try and get you back there.
3118920	3120680	There's that error minimization scheme,
3120680	3125800	which is really a kind of anatomical homeostasis or pattern homeostasis.
3126360	3128680	And a couple of interesting things about this.
3129880	3133880	On the one hand, this is, but biologists know all about feedback loops.
3133880	3134600	It's pretty obvious.
3135080	3139720	But on the other hand, most of the feedback loops we know about are scalar.
3142360	3145080	All of these homeostatic loops require a set point.
3145080	3149320	They need to know like a thermostat needs to know what is the thing with respect
3149320	3150600	to which we calculate error.
3151480	3156440	Most of these examples of homeostasis in biology are scalar numbers.
3156440	3159240	They're pH or temperature level or hunger level or something.
3159240	3160840	I got there a simple quantity.
3160920	3165320	In this case, we're talking about the set point of this process being a complex
3165320	3166760	anatomical descriptor.
3166760	3168760	It doesn't have to be an exact cell by cell kind of thing,
3168760	3171800	but some general notion of what the correct shape should be
3171800	3173640	or the correct length of limbs and stuff like that.
3175000	3175800	So that's unusual.
3175800	3179960	And of course, the whole notion of a process that's in some sense goal directed
3179960	3181160	is a kind of taboo.
3181160	3186840	There's a real what I call teleophobia out there about people are really suspicious
3186840	3189080	about models of processes with goals.
3189080	3194760	But I think that cybernetics since the 40s has given us a mature non-magical science
3194760	3195800	of systems with goals.
3195800	3196840	So I think it's okay.
3197640	3203480	But something interesting about this is that if you only know about the first part of this,
3203480	3207640	then when you want to make changes up here, let's say for biomedical purposes,
3208840	3212440	your only game plan is to alter the genome.
3212440	3214600	And that means you have to solve this inverse problem.
3214600	3219880	You have to ask if I wanted a different shape up here, which genes would I have to change?
3219880	3223560	And as we talked about a few minutes ago, that is in general an unsolvable problem
3223560	3227560	because this process is so complex and so convoluted.
3227560	3228760	You can't just reverse it.
3228760	3231000	You don't know which genes to change.
3231560	3236200	But if there is kind of this homeostasis relative to a set point,
3236200	3237480	then you've got a different strategy.
3237480	3243880	Maybe this isn't at the mechanical clock part of that continuum that I showed you.
3243880	3248760	Maybe this is closer to that thermostat level where you can actually change the set point.
3248760	3254600	You can revise the set point without having to change the hardware without changing the
3254600	3255080	genes at all.
3255080	3256680	And this is what I'm going to show you now.
3256680	3261320	So what we wanted was, and this is years of work on this now,
3262280	3266840	what we wanted was to, if this is all true, we should be able to do a couple of things.
3266840	3270760	First of all, we should be able to identify where that set point is stored.
3270760	3273000	And I'm going to show you that, decode it.
3273000	3276040	And I'm going to show you a couple of examples of how we can actually read it
3276040	3277560	and understand what it says.
3277560	3281560	And we should be able to rewrite it and let the cells build to the new pattern
3281560	3283160	without changing out the hardware.
3283160	3284280	Let me show you that.
3284280	3285640	So how might this work?
3285640	3288120	At the very beginning of this, I started thinking about, okay,
3288120	3292120	how can we even talk about cells and tissues storing a goal state,
3292120	3295720	storing some kind of a target for all this activity?
3296440	3301240	And of course, the one really good uncontroversial example of a biological system
3301240	3304360	that stores goal states and acts towards them is the brain.
3304360	3307160	This is what complex creatures do all the time.
3307160	3311320	So the brain stores memories of target states,
3311320	3315080	and it acts in three-dimensional space to achieve those goals.
3315080	3316280	How does it do it?
3316280	3319000	Well, the hardware looks like this.
3319000	3322040	This is an electrical network where you've got cells.
3322680	3325240	The cells have little ion channels in their membrane,
3325240	3328200	which allows them to pass things like potassium, sodium, and so on.
3328200	3330920	They acquire, by doing that, they acquire a voltage gradient,
3330920	3333400	a difference, voltage difference between inside and out.
3333400	3336760	And that voltage gradient may or may not be communicated to the neighboring cells
3336760	3339960	through these little electric synapses known as gap junctions.
3339960	3344520	So you have a network of cells that can store different states electrically,
3344520	3346200	and they can propagate information,
3346200	3348440	and that information spreads to the network.
3348440	3350920	And that is what runs the software of the brain.
3350920	3355000	And so what you can see here is this group made this amazing video
3355000	3360120	of real-time electrical signaling in the zebrafish, a living zebrafish brain.
3360120	3366600	So you can see here's what's going on as the fish is thinking about
3366600	3368040	whatever fish think about.
3368040	3370840	And it is a commitment of neuroscience
3370840	3374760	that if we were able to read out these electrical signals,
3375320	3378600	we could decode them and thus know what the fish is thinking.
3378600	3383160	We should be able to recover the memories, the goals, the various preferences,
3383160	3386600	the behavioral repertoires, and so on by decoding this.
3386600	3392600	So to summarize, and this is the project of neural decoding here in neuroscience,
3392600	3396440	where you try to image the brain and you make a model
3396440	3399720	and you understand what that animal is thinking or seeing and so on.
3399720	3405880	And so the idea is that according to neuroscience,
3405880	3409080	the bioelectrical signaling in the brain is literally the medium
3409080	3411800	that contains the cognitive content of the mind.
3411800	3414520	So you as a person, all your memories and thoughts and everything else
3414520	3418040	is in some way encoded in the electrophysiology of your brain.
3418040	3420760	Well, the amazing thing is that this ancient...
3420760	3422520	So that's a really neat trick, right?
3422520	3425000	That combination of hardware and software is amazing.
3425800	3429880	But what's really interesting is that architecture,
3429880	3432200	the architecture of having this electrical hardware
3432200	3438680	and thus this very plastic goal seeking clever and problem-solving software
3438680	3440360	is absolutely ancient.
3440360	3443160	So every cell in your body has ion channels.
3443160	3447240	Most of them have gab junctions to neighboring cells.
3447240	3452520	This is not something that's just for neural cells
3452520	3455880	and it's something that's been around since the time of bacterial biofilms.
3455880	3459240	This is evolution figured out this architecture very early on.
3459240	3464520	And so then one can try to extend this and basically this is the project
3464520	3467560	and this is what we've been doing for almost 30 years now
3467560	3471720	is this idea of extending neuroscience beyond neurons.
3471720	3476680	The real kind of magic of neuroscience is not in the neurons.
3476680	3480440	It's in this understanding, this scaling up of cognition.
3480440	3485560	And so what you might imagine is doing exactly the same kind of neural decoding thing,
3485560	3486520	but not on neurons.
3486520	3489560	Let's say on embryos or some other morphogenetic system to ask,
3490280	3493400	here you're asking what is the collective intelligence of neurons thinking.
3493960	3496600	Here you're asking for what is the collective intelligence
3496600	3500760	of the rest of the body cells thinking quite literally.
3501560	3504760	And I can use the thing is, this sounds very strange
3504760	3508680	and a lot of people will say that this is some kind of a weird misuse of a metaphor.
3508680	3512440	But the reason that I can apply all this terminology from neuroscience
3512520	3518600	to outside the brain is because the concepts, the tools, the reagents
3518600	3522600	cannot tell the difference between neurons and non-neural tissues.
3522600	3525480	All of the same tools and concepts work everywhere in the body.
3525480	3526760	This is what we've been showing.
3526760	3530360	And so the concepts are actually very isomorphic.
3530360	3536040	And so what you have here is that whereas the electrical network,
3536040	3537880	just to kind of summarize what I'm saying here,
3538440	3543320	the electrical network of the brain is giving commands to the muscles
3543320	3545800	to move you through three dimensional space.
3545800	3548520	That's the familiar version of neuroscience.
3548520	3550840	And then we can modify it with various techniques
3550840	3552520	and we can read it out and so on.
3552520	3555720	So the electrical network of the brain tells muscles what to do
3555720	3557800	to move you in three dimensional space.
3557800	3559880	But the reason it can do that is because it evolved
3559880	3563560	from a much more ancient system in other tissues in your body
3563640	3566440	that long before brains and muscles evolved,
3566440	3572120	we're telling all the cells how to rearrange your body shape
3572120	3575400	and thus move you in anatomical morphospace.
3575400	3579640	Same strategy, same hardware, same tricks, except it's a different space.
3579640	3582360	And so this is what I said before when I said that evolution
3582360	3585000	was pivoting us through various problem spaces.
3585000	3589480	So what we did was to develop the first molecular tools
3589480	3593160	to read and write this information outside of the nervous system.
3593160	3594440	So how do we do that?
3594440	3599160	So the first thing is a voltage sensitive fluorescent dye.
3599160	3603320	So this is a chemical that emits either different brightness
3603320	3607080	or different wavelengths, light depending on the electrical properties
3607080	3608440	of the cell that it's sitting in.
3608440	3613400	And so what you're seeing here is a time lapse of a frog embryo
3613400	3615160	as during the early stages.
3615160	3619000	And so the colors represent different voltages.
3619000	3623720	And so this is a kind of brain scan, if you will,
3624440	3627400	of all the conversations that the cells are having with each other
3627400	3630120	as they sort out who's going to be left, who's going to be right,
3630120	3633240	who's going to be anterior, posterior, dorsal, ventral, and so on.
3633240	3639800	And so we now have the ability to read out this kind of information.
3639800	3642440	We spend a lot of time doing computer simulations
3642440	3646440	to figure out how these patterns map onto the patterns of ion channels
3646440	3648200	that are present in the cell membranes.
3648200	3649720	I want to show you two kinds of patterns.
3650440	3652360	The first we call the electric face.
3652360	3653800	And this is, again, a time lapse.
3653800	3656760	Now here, it's gray scale instead of color, but it's the same idea.
3656760	3659160	The brightness represents voltage.
3659160	3662440	And so in this early frog embryo that's putting its face together,
3662440	3664920	there's all kinds of changes, lots of exciting stuff happening.
3664920	3666920	But look at this one frame taken from it.
3668120	3671960	Long before the genes are turned on to make the different parts of the face,
3671960	3674360	we can already see what this animal is going to do.
3674360	3676200	Here's where the animal's right eye is going to be.
3676200	3677720	Here's where the mouth is going to be.
3677720	3679720	The left eye comes in slightly thereafter.
3679720	3681160	You will see that momentarily.
3682680	3685160	Here are the placodes on the sides.
3685160	3689080	The B pattern of where everything is going to go
3689080	3694840	is already there in the stable electrical states of the cells
3694840	3696440	if you know how to read them out.
3696440	3697880	So this is the electric face.
3697880	3702520	And I'm going to show you in a minute that if you make changes here,
3702520	3703880	you will change gene expression.
3703880	3704920	You will change anatomy.
3704920	3707240	Therefore, this pattern is instructive.
3707320	3707960	It drives.
3707960	3709960	This is not just some sort of epiphenomenon.
3709960	3715080	This is actually the memory of what the cells are going to be doing
3715800	3716600	to make the face.
3716600	3718040	So that's a natural pattern.
3718040	3721480	But here's a pathological pattern.
3721480	3724040	And we'll talk more about cancer in the third part of the talk.
3724040	3728440	If I inject a human oncogene, there will be a tumor.
3730040	3731720	But before that tumor forms,
3731720	3739080	I can already see where the cells are starting to defect.
3739080	3741240	They acquire this abnormal bioelectric state.
3741880	3743640	And I can already see where the tumor is going to be.
3743640	3745240	So this is a pathological pattern.
3745240	3747560	So in addition to being able to observe all this stuff,
3747560	3750120	which is nice, but it's just observation,
3751320	3754600	what we developed were a set of tools patterned on exactly the same thing
3754600	3758200	done in neuroscience to study synaptic plasticity and intrinsic plasticity.
3758760	3763400	And basically be able to, so I showed you how to read the patterns.
3763400	3764920	I'm showing you how to write the patterns.
3764920	3768840	So you can rewrite those patterns by manipulating the gap junctions,
3768840	3770200	these electrical synapses.
3770200	3773000	So that controls the connectivity of this network.
3773000	3775880	Or you can actually open channels, open them,
3776920	3779240	using drugs or close them using drugs, using light,
3779240	3783320	the various kinds of stimuli to control the voltage of every cell.
3783320	3786200	So to be clear, there are no applied fields.
3786200	3787400	There are no electrodes.
3787400	3789480	There's no electromagnetic radiation.
3789480	3791160	There are no magnets, nothing like that.
3791160	3796520	This is molecular physiology using the natural interface
3796520	3798280	that these cells are exposing to us.
3798280	3801560	These, this is the same interface that they use to hack each other.
3801560	3803720	These are, this is the way the cells are communicating,
3803720	3805000	and we're just hijacking it.
3805000	3807400	So there are no external fields, nothing like that.
3808680	3812680	Okay, so using this technology then, we know what happens
3812680	3813640	when you use it in the brain.
3813640	3815960	So somebody like Tanagawa at MIT can use this
3815960	3819240	to put false memories into the brains of mice,
3819240	3821560	using exactly this technology in the brain.
3821560	3823720	We are going to put false memories
3823720	3827240	into the somatic networks of cells that are building the body.
3827240	3829000	So when you do that, here's what happens.
3829640	3834280	You can convince cells to make ectopic hearts like this.
3834280	3836120	Here are some extra hearts in the tadpole.
3836120	3837400	You can make extra limbs.
3837400	3840200	So you can ask the cells in the jaw to start generating a limb.
3840200	3843480	And here are some six-legged frogs here.
3843480	3845240	You can make ectopic forebrain.
3845240	3848200	You can make ectopic inner ear organs right here.
3848200	3849480	Or you can even make fins.
3849480	3850680	Now that's especially weird
3850680	3852360	because tadpoles aren't supposed to have fins.
3852360	3854920	And I'll show you some of that momentarily.
3854920	3856760	But here's one of my favorite examples.
3857640	3859480	I showed you, if you remember that electric face,
3859480	3860920	one of the things about that electric face
3860920	3864200	was that there was a pattern that said where the eye should go.
3864200	3867000	It represented the location where the cells should become an eye.
3867080	3870200	And so we simply said, okay, if we try to reproduce
3870200	3871960	that electrical state elsewhere in the body,
3871960	3875480	can we induce some other kinds of cells to be an eye?
3877240	3877800	And so we did.
3877800	3880360	So we injected some mRNA encoding,
3880360	3884920	some potassium channels into a different type of cells
3884920	3887400	that were not going to be that region.
3887400	3888840	In particular, they were this gut.
3888840	3890200	They were fated to be gut.
3890200	3893560	And if you do that, if you create that pattern in those cells,
3893560	3895960	sure enough, they will make, they will build an eye.
3895960	3898920	And these eyes will have all the right cell layers.
3898920	3902920	So retinal lens, optic nerve, they'll have all that stuff.
3902920	3904600	Notice, notice a couple of interesting things.
3904600	3908520	Number one, this bioelectric pattern is instructive.
3908520	3909720	It tells cells what to do.
3909720	3911480	It doesn't just ruin the old pattern,
3911480	3913720	it actually can call up whole organs.
3913720	3917800	Number two, it expands the notion of competency.
3917800	3919720	In the developmental biology textbook,
3919720	3922920	what you will read is that only these cells up here
3922920	3924360	in the anterior and directed room
3924360	3926280	are actually competent to become eye.
3926280	3929080	And that's true if you use the traditional way of inducing eyes,
3929080	3931240	which is this master eye gene called PAC-6.
3931240	3933480	But it's not true if you go up a level
3933480	3936440	and use the bioelectric signals, you can make eyes anywhere.
3936440	3938280	So it completely changes our idea.
3939000	3941160	Learning to hack these cells in a different way
3941160	3944600	changes this, our understanding of their competency.
3945960	3948440	And notice the third thing that's amazing
3948440	3951560	is that we didn't provide very much information at all.
3951560	3952760	I mean, eyes are very complex.
3952840	3955080	We didn't tell this animal how to make an eye.
3955080	3959720	We basically just triggered the eye morphogenetic subroutine
3959720	3962280	with a simple trigger that says build an eye here.
3962280	3962680	That's it.
3962680	3964200	We didn't say where the stem cells go
3964200	3966120	or how to make a retina, none of that.
3966120	3967240	It's very modular.
3967240	3968840	It's very hierarchical.
3969960	3973960	And so the next kind of part of this
3973960	3975480	that's my favorite is this.
3975480	3978440	Here's a lens, an ectopic lens sitting out
3978440	3980040	in the tail of a tadpole somewhere.
3980040	3981800	So we've induced the lens.
3981800	3983320	The way we've induced it is just like here.
3983320	3985080	We injected some ion channels.
3985080	3988760	These ion channels are labeled with this blue beta-gal signal.
3989720	3992200	So what you can see here is that the blue cells are the ones
3992200	3994120	to which we said build an eye.
3995160	3997800	But there's not enough of them to build a proper lens.
3997800	3998600	And so what did they do?
3998600	4001080	They recruited a bunch of their nearby buddies,
4001080	4003560	all of this stuff here that we never touched.
4004360	4005880	So it's a secondary instruction.
4005880	4008040	We instruct these cells to make an eye.
4008040	4010040	They instruct their neighbors to work with them
4010040	4011240	to complete the task.
4011240	4013560	This is something you see in other collective intelligence
4013560	4016760	is like ants, where when a few ants come across a project
4016760	4018520	that's too big for them to handle, what do they do?
4018520	4019960	They recruit others.
4019960	4023400	And so this ability of the system to self-scale
4023400	4025400	to the available problem is something
4025400	4027080	that you see in other collective intelligences.
4027080	4030760	So we don't have to tell these cells how big an eye should be
4030760	4032360	or how many cells there should be.
4032360	4034120	All of this is part of the competency
4034120	4037480	of this amazing agential medium in which we're working.
4037480	4039160	And we'll get to that notion.
4039160	4041720	But the fact that these cells are solving problems collectively,
4041720	4044040	they know how big this group is.
4044040	4045480	They know how big it's supposed to be.
4045480	4048040	The collective functionally knows all these things
4048040	4050760	because you can see it.
4050760	4055720	So we use the same kind of strategy
4055720	4058280	to address the issue of leg regeneration.
4058280	4060760	So frogs normally do not regenerate their legs,
4060760	4061960	unlike salamanders.
4061960	4063880	But what we can do is after amputation,
4063880	4066840	we can treat with a cocktail of ion channel drugs.
4066840	4069240	And in fact, they turn on immediately
4069240	4071000	these pro regenerative genes.
4071000	4072040	They begin to make a leg.
4072040	4072920	You've got some toes.
4072920	4075640	By 45 days, you've already got a toenail and some toes.
4075640	4077560	Eventually, a very nice leg.
4077560	4079960	The leg is touch sensitive and motile.
4079960	4083880	And all of this happens from a brief modulation.
4083880	4086120	In fact, in the recent work on adult frogs,
4086120	4089240	we show that just one day, 24 hours of application
4089240	4093560	of our cocktail, you get a year and a half of leg growth.
4093560	4094920	So this is not 3D printing.
4094920	4095960	This is not scaffolds.
4095960	4097880	This is not us telling stem cells where to go
4097880	4099640	or what tissues go next to what tissues.
4099640	4101560	We have no idea how to build a frog leg.
4101560	4104040	It'll be a really long time before anybody
4104040	4106520	can micromanage that process, but you don't need to.
4106520	4108360	Because the cells already know how to do it.
4108360	4109880	What you do need to do is to convince them
4109880	4111880	that that's what they should do instead of scarring.
4111880	4113720	And that doesn't take very long.
4113720	4115320	24 hours is plenty.
4115320	4116760	And once they've decided that that's
4116760	4118680	where they're going in morphogenetic space,
4118680	4119880	they will keep going.
4119880	4121960	And this is how regenerative medicine
4121960	4124840	can take advantage of the competencies of these cells.
4124920	4126520	And here I should do a disclosure,
4126520	4129160	because David Kaplan and I are co-founders of a company
4129160	4130840	called Morphosuticals Inc.
4130840	4133000	And what we're trying to do is the same thing in rodents.
4133000	4135720	So David makes these amazing wearable bioreactors
4135720	4139160	that apply to the wound site, our drug payloads,
4139160	4141240	which are various things that attempt
4141240	4143720	to convince the cells that they should regenerate.
4143720	4147720	So hopefully, eventually, we'll be using this
4147720	4148840	in clinical practice.
4148840	4151400	For now, we've done it in frog.
4151400	4154120	We're currently trying to do it in mammals
4154120	4156760	and eventually, hopefully, in patients.
4156760	4157720	OK.
4157720	4161320	For the next story, I want to switch back to planarium.
4161320	4163480	So this kind of animal.
4163480	4166440	And I want to, at this point, make good on the promise
4166440	4168360	that I made about 10 minutes ago, which
4168360	4172040	is to show you how those gold states are actually encoded.
4172040	4175400	How does the tissue remember what a correct animal
4175400	4176280	should look like?
4176280	4179400	And the planaria are a great example of this,
4179400	4181800	because if you cut them into pieces,
4181800	4185960	and the record is something like 276, I believe,
4185960	4188520	each of these pieces regrows a perfect little worm.
4188520	4191080	They make exactly what's needed, no more, no less.
4191080	4193320	And in fact, it's a tough problem, because even
4193320	4197080	if you make just one cut here, these cells back here
4197080	4198360	have to make a tail.
4198360	4200200	These cells up here have to make a head,
4200200	4201720	but they were exact neighbors.
4201720	4203080	Right up until the time you cut them,
4203080	4204120	they were exact neighbors.
4204120	4207320	And yet they have radically different anatomical fates.
4207320	4208840	So you cannot decide if you're going
4208840	4211080	to be a head or a tail based on your position in the animal.
4211080	4212040	They have the same position.
4212040	4213160	You can cut anywhere.
4213160	4215800	It's after the cut, you have to now figure out,
4215800	4216520	what am I missing?
4216520	4217480	What do I still have?
4217480	4220200	And what does a correct planarian look like?
4220200	4222600	So oh, and by the way, these animals are also immoral.
4222600	4224800	In case you're interested in aging,
4224800	4227080	planaria are, they do not age.
4227080	4228600	There's no such thing as an old planarian,
4228600	4232120	because they continuously regenerate their tissues.
4232120	4234520	So we wanted to ask this simple question.
4234520	4237000	OK, here's our planarian.
4237000	4239200	And we amputate the head, and we amputate the tail.
4239240	4241200	So you have this middle fragment.
4241200	4243440	The middle fragment reliably regenerates
4243440	4245720	to have one head, one tail.
4245720	4247960	How does this piece know how many heads and tails
4247960	4249040	it's supposed to have?
4249040	4252480	So we investigated and found out that there's actually
4252480	4254720	an electrical circuit, which I don't have time to go into,
4254720	4257360	but there's an electrical circuit, which actually
4257360	4259520	encodes the number of heads that they're supposed to have.
4259520	4263760	And so what we were able to do then is this.
4263760	4268160	Here is a visualization of the normal electrical pattern
4268160	4271040	in these fragments, so one head, one tail.
4271040	4273720	But what you can do is you can rewrite that pattern
4273720	4275200	to say two heads.
4275200	4276920	Now, this is kind of messy still.
4276920	4279280	So the technology is still very much in development,
4279280	4281480	but you can already see, you can do that.
4281480	4283680	And when you do that to this animal,
4283680	4286120	they go ahead and they make a two-headed flatworm.
4286120	4287000	This is not Photoshop.
4287000	4289680	These are real two-headed animals.
4289680	4291840	Notice something interesting.
4291840	4295120	So here's anatomically one head, one tail.
4295120	4296920	The gene expression for the head is, of course,
4296960	4298800	in the head and so on.
4298800	4302200	This animal, this bioelectrical map
4302200	4303760	is not a map of this two-headed guy.
4303760	4307480	This is a map of this perfectly normal, anatomically normal,
4307480	4308680	one-headed animal.
4308680	4310640	Not only is his anatomy still normal,
4310640	4313480	his molecular biology is still normal.
4313480	4316760	The anterior marker is still only on in the head,
4316760	4318280	not in the tail.
4318280	4321200	So, and yet, if you were to cut them,
4321200	4323280	they go on and to make two-headed flatworms.
4323320	4326920	So let me pause here and just explain,
4326920	4328680	to underline what's going on here.
4329680	4332840	This bioelectrical pattern is what I promised before
4332840	4336920	as a readout of where the information
4336920	4338480	for the target morphology,
4338480	4341080	the target, the correct pattern to build,
4341080	4342280	this is where it's stored.
4342280	4345200	It is literally stored in this electrical map,
4345200	4347640	the way that memories are thought to be stored
4347640	4348960	in the brain.
4348960	4352480	Also, a single normal planarian body
4352480	4356120	is able to store one of two different ideas
4356120	4358640	about what a correct planarian should look like.
4358640	4359520	In other words, this again,
4359520	4361000	sounds very much like the nervous system
4361000	4363160	where the exact same hardware, your brain,
4363160	4366360	can store many, many different types of ideas,
4366360	4368160	and you do not have to genetically edit your brain
4368160	4371000	to have it store different types of information.
4371000	4373600	It's just built to have different targets
4373600	4375600	that it can remember.
4375600	4378800	And so, and the third amazing thing about this is that
4378800	4381920	this pattern memory is a kind of counterfactual,
4381920	4385880	meaning that this is a memory of what I am going to do
4385880	4387880	if I get injured in the future.
4387880	4389080	It's not what I'm doing now.
4389080	4391480	It's what I will do if at some point in the future
4391480	4392360	I get injured.
4392360	4396080	So that ability to, it's a very primitive version
4396080	4398040	of what's sort of magical about brains,
4398040	4400680	which is this ability to mental time travel,
4400680	4403720	to think about, to have memories of things
4403720	4405880	that happened long ago and are not true now,
4405880	4407360	and to have anticipation of things
4407360	4408440	that might happen in the future
4408440	4409920	that are also not happening now.
4409920	4412080	People think that this is very much
4412080	4413880	the kind of thing that brains do and it is,
4413880	4417200	but the evolutionary precursors of that are ancient,
4417200	4420560	and even the planarian morphological intelligence
4420560	4424560	has a degree of ability to do this kind of mental time travel.
4424560	4426440	Now, why do I keep calling it a memory?
4426440	4430940	Because if you take these two-headed worms,
4432320	4433880	and you cut them again in plain water,
4433880	4436800	no more manipulation of any kind,
4436800	4439400	they continue to form two-headed animals.
4439440	4441600	So no genetic change.
4441600	4442680	The hardware is untouched.
4442680	4444800	These, the genomes here are exactly the same.
4444800	4446160	We haven't done any genomic editing,
4446160	4447800	nothing wrong with their genomes.
4447800	4450560	And yet this is a permanent line of animals
4450560	4454640	that will continue to generate two-headed creatures,
4454640	4457240	even though they have the normal wild-type genome.
4457240	4460440	So the question of where is,
4460440	4462200	remember that slide I showed at the beginning,
4462200	4463960	that human torso, and I asked,
4463960	4465560	where is that information stored?
4466640	4468200	Where is the information stored
4468200	4470840	for the number of heads a worm should have?
4470840	4471760	It isn't genetic,
4471760	4474840	because you can take the exact same genetic hardware
4474840	4476760	and have it be two-headed.
4476760	4478480	But what the genome does do
4478480	4481080	is to build an electrical circuit
4481080	4484480	that by default stores the information for one head,
4484480	4486320	but it can be pushed to other fates,
4486320	4488960	for example, to store information for two heads.
4488960	4490120	So this is why I call it memory.
4490120	4491800	It's long-term stable.
4491800	4493720	It's rewritable, and we can also, by the way,
4493720	4496480	take two-headed and put them back to one-headed.
4496480	4497640	And it has this latency,
4497640	4499360	which I just showed you, this conditional recall.
4499360	4502600	It doesn't kick in until you've injured the animal.
4502600	4503440	And so here you can see,
4503440	4506920	this is a video of these two-headed critters
4506920	4508600	doing their thing.
4508600	4510640	Okay, and so what we're doing now
4510640	4515640	is lots of computational modeling,
4516680	4518800	and actually using lots of ideas
4518800	4521960	from connectionist machine learning
4521960	4523480	to try and understand specifically
4523480	4525880	how the electrical circuits that are in these planaria
4525880	4530040	can store different types of target patterns
4530040	4531520	and reconstruct those patterns
4531520	4534080	even when the information has been damaged.
4534080	4539080	Now, I've shown you this story about two heads and so on.
4539160	4541440	It's not just about the number of heads.
4541440	4543240	One other amazing thing you can do
4543240	4547920	is push them to make heads of different species.
4547920	4550520	So here is a planarian with a nice triangular head
4550520	4552720	that's appropriate to his species.
4552720	4553920	We can cut off that head,
4553960	4556120	perturb the electrical network topology,
4556120	4557440	let them settle back down.
4557440	4559440	And when they regenerate their heads,
4559440	4560760	sometimes they make the normal head,
4560760	4562200	but sometimes they make round heads
4562200	4563640	like this S-Mediterranean.
4563640	4566560	Sometimes they make flat heads like this Pifelina.
4566560	4567800	Again, no genetic change here.
4567800	4569880	This has nothing to do with rewiring the hardware.
4569880	4572200	What it is is pushing that same machine
4572200	4575440	into other attractors in that enormous space
4575440	4578280	of morphogenetic configurations
4578280	4579680	that they're able to traverse.
4579680	4580840	They're normally very good
4580840	4582760	at going exactly where they need to go,
4582760	4585920	but they can in fact visit other regions of that state space
4585920	4587720	that normally belong to other species.
4587720	4588640	And not just the head shape,
4588640	4591640	but also the shape of the brain,
4591640	4593080	the distribution of stem cells,
4593080	4594440	just like these other species,
4594440	4598000	150 to 100 million years distance.
4598000	4601200	So again, this notion of reprogrammable biological hardware,
4601200	4603440	they can do other things beyond the default
4603440	4604800	that they normally do.
4604800	4606960	And by the way, they can go even further
4606960	4610560	into the latent morphospace of a typical planarian
4610560	4613360	and Darcy Thompson as early as 1917,
4613360	4615960	he had this notion of living beings
4615960	4620240	exploring various kinds of mathematical morphospace.
4620240	4622800	You can make them go further than a typical planarian
4622800	4625720	and you can make these things that are sort of,
4625720	4626840	they're not flat anymore.
4626840	4628360	They're round and cylindrical
4628360	4629480	and they're sort of hybrid shapes
4629480	4631720	or these crazy spiky things.
4631720	4633840	These wild type cells are capable
4633840	4635840	of building lots of different stuff.
4635840	4639200	And so what we're doing now is really trying
4639200	4641400	to make these full stack computational models
4641400	4644360	that go all the way from the lowest level molecular details
4644360	4647200	of which genes are turned on and off.
4647200	4652200	And then build the models of the bioelectric states,
4654000	4657560	the cellular and tissue-wide bioelectric states
4657560	4659080	that result from these ion channels
4659080	4664080	and eventually all the way up to body-wide decisions
4664400	4666120	and algorithms, which is what you need
4666120	4667520	for that anatomical compiler
4667520	4668920	that I talked about at the beginning,
4668960	4670320	which is to understand how the tissue
4670320	4671680	is actually making decisions
4671680	4673800	about large scale shape, number of heads,
4673800	4675560	type of heads and so on.
4675560	4677880	Okay, so just a couple more minutes
4677880	4679040	and then we'll take another break.
4679040	4680920	I just, the last thing I wanna show you here
4680920	4685920	is a biomedical intervention that emerges
4686920	4688680	from this kind of approach.
4688680	4691400	And it has to do with fixing frog brains.
4691400	4693000	So here's a normal tadpole brain,
4693000	4694520	here's the forebrain, here's the midbrain,
4694520	4696880	here's the hindbrain, this is the normal structure.
4696880	4701320	And if you expose these guys to various teratogens
4701320	4705200	like nicotine, what you'll see is alcohol, nicotine,
4705200	4706040	lots of different things.
4706040	4709720	What you'll see is that a real defect in brain formation,
4709720	4711080	the eyes are connected to the brain,
4711080	4713200	the forebrain is basically missing,
4713200	4714880	lots of problems here.
4714880	4715840	And so we wanted to know,
4715840	4717440	well, how would you fix something like this?
4717440	4719720	It's very complex, we don't wanna try to tell
4719720	4721880	every cell what to do, how do we fix this?
4721880	4726880	And so Alexis Pytak, who's a member
4727240	4728280	of our Allen Discovery Center,
4728280	4730640	made this computational model.
4730640	4735240	And with FiveHalfPy, who's a staff scientist in the group,
4735240	4736480	they simply asked the question,
4736480	4740100	what underlies the bioelectric gradients
4740100	4742840	that normally tell the cells how big and normal,
4742840	4744880	and what shape a normal brain should be?
4744880	4746640	And so when you have a model like this,
4746640	4748680	you can ask it questions and you can say,
4748680	4750680	well, if the pattern is incorrect,
4750720	4752880	what would we have to do to make it correct?
4752880	4756920	And so the model gave us an answer.
4756920	4759960	It said, well, there's this particular channel called HCN2.
4759960	4761640	And if you were to open that up,
4761640	4763520	it would be, the pattern would be restored
4763520	4764640	and the cells would know what to do.
4764640	4766200	And so here's an example,
4766200	4769640	and this is actually a much more difficult case
4769640	4771760	than that teratogen case I showed you.
4771760	4773580	This is a notch mutation.
4773580	4777800	So notch is a really critical neurogenesis gene
4777800	4778720	in the absence of notch.
4778720	4779800	You can see the brain is,
4779800	4781600	the forebrain is gone, the midbrain and hindbrain
4781600	4782780	are a big bubble full of water.
4782780	4785400	I mean, these animals are profoundly affected.
4785400	4788160	But even though that notch mutation is there,
4788160	4791320	if you force the cells to have the correct bioelectrical
4791320	4793520	pattern by using the strategy given to us
4793520	4796320	by the computational model, the brain becomes normal.
4796320	4800000	So they get their shape of the brain back,
4800000	4801000	they get gene expression back,
4801000	4802520	and they get their IQs back.
4804200	4807160	Their learning rates are indistinguishable from controls.
4807160	4808920	So this is an amazing example
4808920	4813920	of not only instructively repairing complex defects
4815520	4816800	using this bioelectrical approach,
4816800	4820440	but specifically fixing a hardware defect in software.
4820440	4821480	And I'm not saying that's gonna work
4821480	4823920	for all genetic defects.
4823920	4825120	There are many things that bioelectrics
4825120	4826280	are not gonna work for,
4826280	4828360	but it's again, this idea of plasticity.
4828360	4832760	The idea is that broken hardware is not the end of the line,
4832760	4834160	that if the algorithm is good,
4834160	4836480	which for example, in Plenary, it's absolutely amazing,
4836480	4837640	if the algorithm is good,
4837640	4839560	you can often get around these defects
4839560	4841560	and still get to where you need to go
4841560	4843640	if you can remember what the correct pattern is.
4843640	4848240	And so the biomedical roadmap looks roughly like this.
4848240	4850160	We're making this sort of turnkey system
4851160	4853600	where, and you can sort of play with parts of it
4853600	4855480	or already online,
4855480	4859240	where you know what the incorrect pattern currently is,
4859240	4862400	you should know what the correct pattern is,
4862400	4864640	and this is something that we're still working on
4864640	4866760	to acquire these physiomic data sets.
4866760	4869200	And then the model can actually tell you
4869200	4871920	which channels and pumps to trigger,
4871920	4874600	so how to communicate your anatomical goals
4874600	4876200	to that set of cells.
4876200	4878160	And then of course, once you know which channels,
4878160	4881560	then it's pretty easy to pick drugs that you already know.
4881560	4886160	So looking forward,
4886160	4889320	the impact on biomedicine
4889320	4891760	is to complement all of this,
4891760	4895160	all of these current kind of technologies,
4895160	4898600	so surgery, transplants, stem cells, genomic editing,
4898600	4901080	rewriting, gene regulatory networks,
4902360	4905120	molecular drugs that target proteins and so on.
4905120	4906560	All of these things are bottom up,
4906560	4907480	they're micromanagement,
4907480	4908920	they're targeting the pathways
4908920	4911000	to exactly do what you need to do.
4911000	4912000	You can complement that
4912000	4914760	by taking advantage of the tissue intelligence.
4914760	4916400	And so we've talked about,
4916400	4917240	in this part of the talk,
4917240	4918600	we've talked about many examples
4918600	4920920	of cells and tissues solving problems.
4920920	4925080	They can find new ways to deal with physiological challenges,
4925080	4927760	to with anatomical challenges,
4927760	4929160	and with gene expression challenges.
4929160	4931160	So they have various competencies,
4931160	4933840	they can recruit neighbors as needed,
4933840	4937400	they can find different paths to the same outcome.
4937400	4941640	And if we can sort of take advantage of all those subroutines
4941640	4943840	through either cell training or tissue training
4943840	4946440	or various kinds of other triggers,
4946440	4947920	which we call morphosuticals
4947920	4950280	and the subset of electrosuticals,
4950280	4951720	then I think,
4951720	4953120	and you can find all the details here,
4953120	4955880	really transformative types of regenerative medicine
4955880	4956720	are gonna be available.
4956720	4959240	And I think that overall,
4960040	4962360	and possibly surprising nobody who works
4962360	4967360	in these sorts of traditional alternative medicine modalities,
4968240	4969840	the future of this approach
4969840	4973080	is gonna look a lot more like a kind of somatic psychiatry
4973080	4974400	than it is like chemistry.
4974400	4977880	Because bioelectricity is that interface layer
4977880	4980480	that enables top-down controls,
4980480	4982840	in other words, memories of global patterns
4982840	4984320	in various spaces,
4984320	4987400	to filter down to the molecular machinery
4987400	4989200	that actually activates them.
4989200	4992520	And so that's something that's really quite unique
4992520	4993840	to this bioelectrical layer.
4993840	4995960	And it's not just some, this is important to mention,
4995960	4998080	it's not just some rare thing that works
4998080	5003080	in the case of hypnodermatology and mind body medicine
5003760	5006960	and weird altered states and biofeedback.
5006960	5009560	It works 24-7 in your body.
5009560	5011480	When you decide in the morning,
5011480	5013400	you wake up and you decide that you're going to work,
5013400	5017840	that high-level cognitive intent
5017840	5019200	of what you want to do
5019200	5021000	has to depolarize your muscle cells
5021000	5022680	for you to be able to get out of bed.
5022680	5026000	So voluntary behavior is already showing you
5026000	5027200	this mind-body connection,
5027200	5030320	this idea that these high-level executive cognitive goals
5030920	5032600	have to eventually trickle down
5032600	5034520	to control molecular events in your muscles
5034520	5035360	and in your glands.
5035360	5038520	So this is the way our bodies work as a multi-scale system
5038520	5041600	all the way from high-level cognitive structures
5041600	5043880	down to the molecular pathways.
5043880	5047080	And bioelectricity is the layer that does that.
5047080	5049560	So I'm going to call a break now.
5049560	5052320	Let's take a couple of minutes.
5052320	5054160	Everybody gets some water.
5054160	5055520	I'm going to be back in about three minutes
5055520	5057760	and then people can ask questions.
5058760	5060760	But take a break for a few here.
5060760	5061840	All right, I'm back.
5061840	5064000	If anybody wants to start asking questions.
5065400	5068840	Yes, I can see Matthew's got his hand up already.
5071440	5072800	Great, thank you.
5074760	5076400	Hey, Michael, thanks so much for this
5077640	5080360	really astonishing research that you're doing.
5080360	5082200	This is wonderful to listen to.
5084400	5085680	I know you're a scientist,
5085960	5089080	but I think you're also verging
5089080	5091760	on some deep philosophical questions here.
5091760	5095880	And so I want to ask you if you think that the work
5095880	5100000	that you're doing, showing the work
5100000	5101600	that these bioelectric fields do,
5101600	5104480	it's obviously challenging a certain kind of reductionism.
5106200	5109240	But do you think there's a new philosophy of nature
5110520	5114960	opening up as you push the frontiers of biological science?
5114960	5117760	And what I mean here is, particularly,
5117760	5121280	to give an example on the question of memory,
5122920	5126920	it seems to me that the distributed memory
5126920	5131920	that you're finding in multicellular organisms
5132320	5134840	seems to suggest something more along the lines
5134840	5136440	of the philosophy of nature
5136440	5141440	that Bergson or Whitehead would suggest
5141440	5145040	where memory is not as the scientific materialist
5145040	5146640	philosophy of nature would suggest something
5146640	5150520	that's memory could only be something stored
5150520	5151960	through some material trace.
5153280	5155280	What Bergson, Whitehead and other thinkers
5155280	5160280	in that vein would say is that to understand memory
5161440	5165840	or consciousness, you really need to see nature
5165840	5170840	as this process of what Whitehead would call accumulation
5171120	5174800	so that the past is inherited in the present
5177600	5182320	and it's still present, the past is present in other words,
5182320	5184120	it's not gone, it's not somewhere else,
5184120	5187640	it doesn't need to be recorded on some material medium
5187640	5190280	necessarily, though of course traces are left
5190280	5193240	as nature accumulates in this process of growth.
5194400	5197400	And so it seems to me that memory therefore becomes something
5197400	5199800	that if we're gonna talk about how or where is it stored,
5200520	5203120	it's stored everywhere, not only in the organism
5203120	5205920	within the skin boundary of the organism
5205920	5208240	but the whole environment is in some sense
5208240	5211240	storing the memory if we wanna think of it that way.
5211240	5213680	You take the organism out of its environment,
5213680	5217240	is it really gonna be able to produce the form
5217240	5220720	that we would think it's remembering,
5220720	5223400	because it depends on all this environmental context
5223400	5224720	to do what it does.
5224720	5227040	And so yeah, that's one example of what a new philosophy
5227040	5228800	of nature might suggest as regards to memory
5228800	5231720	but how do you see your work venturing
5231720	5234960	into these deeper philosophical questions?
5234960	5239960	Yeah, so let's say this, I think that the right way
5240840	5245840	to think about the relationship between the experiments
5246000	5249960	and all of that and these different philosophical takes
5249960	5253800	is as a set of, so my framework you can in fact,
5253800	5256080	you can see it here, it's called the TAME,
5256120	5260240	technological approach to mind everywhere.
5260240	5263440	And the reason that I emphasize technological
5263440	5268440	is that I want the philosophical concepts
5268480	5270840	to be testable and to do specific work.
5270840	5274440	In other words, what I am looking for
5274440	5277560	is for different lenses or different ways
5277560	5282160	of looking at these phenomena that facilitate progress.
5282160	5287160	So a philosophical worldview is to me is useful
5287320	5290680	to the extent that it can be applied to the things we do
5290680	5292700	to drive new discoveries, new capabilities
5292700	5294720	to drive a research program basically.
5294720	5298720	So the reality is I've borrowed in order to make all
5298720	5302840	of these kind of new findings and that my lab has found
5304200	5307480	these were done because we borrowed from all kinds
5307480	5309760	of unusual ways of thinking about the world
5309760	5312000	that are not standard in the field.
5312000	5315800	And so to that extent, I do think we absolutely interface
5315800	5319400	with interesting different philosophical views
5319400	5322000	be they, you know, Berberxen or whoever else.
5322840	5326120	But that's it for, that's what I'm looking for.
5326120	5330240	So for example, on the specific example that you mentioned,
5330240	5332920	if you say that memory is sort of everywhere,
5332920	5337160	that's fine, I suspect that has a lot of value to it.
5337160	5339120	The next question is, okay, how do we turn that
5339120	5344120	into a specific intervention that shows us to be able
5344120	5345360	to do something that you could not do
5345360	5347000	if you didn't have that worldview.
5347000	5350480	So that's where the rubber has to meet the road
5350480	5355480	in terms of facilitating experimental advances
5355640	5359080	and finding new research.
5359080	5362040	So I think that's a longer, we can have a whole other
5362040	5364600	discussion about where I've borrowed a lot of this stuff
5364600	5368000	from because it is interesting, but everything to me,
5368040	5371640	everything has to eventually interface strongly
5371640	5373840	with the research enterprise.
5377800	5378640	Thank you.
5378640	5379480	Let's do one more.
5382360	5384680	Don't see any hands up yet,
5384680	5387600	but also given the time to be, we can carry on.
5387600	5390160	Yeah, let's keep going and then I'll do the last part
5390160	5393440	and then we can talk about whatever people want at the end.
5393440	5397800	Okay, so in this final part, I wanna come back to,
5398640	5399800	so let's remember where we were.
5399800	5403680	We started out acknowledging this kind of multi-scale
5403680	5407800	architecture of the body and trying to widen this idea
5407800	5411760	of intelligence towards a continuum of competency
5411760	5413560	from very simple kinds of things,
5413560	5417180	too much more complex things in diverse problem spaces.
5417180	5420160	And so, and then we went through some very specific
5420160	5424200	examples of bioelectricity as a kind of cognitive glue
5424200	5428200	that holds together these competent components,
5428200	5431000	for example, cells and allows the collective to solve
5431000	5432920	problems in morphogenetic space
5432920	5435280	and the implications for biomedicine.
5435280	5438600	I wanna circle back kind of to a somewhat more
5438600	5442400	philosophical aspect to really start to dig into
5442400	5445640	what does it mean to be an agent or a self
5445640	5449080	and how does it work that components are able
5449080	5451720	to make these emergent cells?
5451720	5454180	And then I wanna show you some novel organisms
5454180	5457580	as a kind of tool with which to explore this latent space
5457580	5459380	that I've been hinting at.
5459380	5462140	So, here we go.
5464180	5467420	Remember back to the original kind of goal
5467420	5471340	for this framework was to be able to think about
5471340	5475980	very diverse kinds of agents all in the same space.
5475980	5479980	So how do we think about synthetic beings
5479980	5483140	and possible aliens and cells and tissues and humans
5483980	5487420	and birds and everything else kind of on the same,
5487420	5488620	using the same framework.
5488620	5490980	And so, and so what I come up with was this notion
5490980	5492660	of a cognitive light cone.
5492660	5494420	So cognitive light cone, which is shown here
5494420	5497540	and this is kind of a, if anybody's into physics
5497540	5499540	you'll recognize this is a kind of upside down
5499540	5503100	Mankowski cone where space, all the three dimensions
5503100	5505180	of space are collapsed onto this axis
5505180	5507220	and time is on this axis.
5507220	5510380	And what the cognitive light cone is,
5510580	5514660	is simply the size of the largest goal
5514660	5516620	that a given system can work towards.
5516620	5518620	So not how far away can it sense
5518620	5520100	or how far away can it act,
5520100	5523420	but the size of the largest goal state that it can pursue.
5523420	5526260	So if all you care about is the local concentration
5526260	5528460	of sucrose, then maybe you're a bacterium
5528460	5530500	and you've got a tiny little cognitive light cone
5530500	5531740	that has a tiny bit of memory
5531740	5533700	from what the concentration was 20 minutes ago,
5533700	5536700	a little bit of predictive capacity and that's it.
5536700	5539940	If you are something like a dog,
5539940	5542100	well, you have a lot more memory going backwards,
5542100	5543980	more predictive power going forwards.
5543980	5546140	You have the ability to have the goal
5546140	5548780	of let's say protecting the whole sort of property.
5548780	5550780	So you have some idea of the size of a yard
5550780	5552140	and what's going on,
5552140	5554660	but you're never going to care about what happens
5554660	5557420	three times, three towns over a month from now.
5557420	5559660	It's just that that's too far in the future
5559660	5562420	and also in space for that cognitive, as far as we know
5562420	5565340	for that cognitive system to have any of that as a goal.
5565340	5567740	If you're a human, you could have an absolutely enormous
5567740	5570820	light cone where you might be working towards world peace
5570820	5572100	over the next hundred years
5572100	5574260	and you could have these very large light cones.
5574260	5576940	And by the way, you have the added psychological pressure
5576940	5579500	of knowing for a fact that some of your goals
5579500	5581980	are not achievable in your lifetime
5581980	5583820	because your cognitive light cone is bigger
5583820	5588580	than your actual survival, your possible survival.
5588580	5590420	So if you're a goldfish, you don't have that problem.
5590420	5594900	All your goals are achievable in your lifetime
5594900	5597940	because they're all very kind of short path.
5597940	5602140	And of course, as maybe it was Beth or somebody had pointed out
5602140	5605620	that we are of course compound intelligences
5605620	5607140	because we are made of components
5607140	5608940	with their own little cognitive light cones
5608940	5610180	in their own spaces.
5610180	5614820	So we are this huge patchwork of compound intelligences
5614820	5618220	all of which see different worlds in different spaces
5618220	5620580	and are all cooperating and competing and so on
5620580	5622620	both across and within levels.
5622620	5624140	So with this notion,
5624180	5625540	let's think about a few things.
5625540	5628300	First of all, let's go back to this idea
5628300	5629780	of a collective intelligence.
5629780	5634780	So if somebody shows you a human brain,
5635260	5637900	if you didn't already know what a human look like
5637900	5638980	and maybe even if you did
5638980	5640500	because it's not an obvious question
5640500	5643100	and somebody asks you, how many individuals are in there?
5643100	5645100	How many selves are in there?
5645100	5648660	And it leads to the fact that we do not know actually
5648660	5650900	how much brain matter it takes
5650900	5653260	to support a single human self.
5653260	5655340	I mean, we see the normal case,
5655340	5658340	but this leads to people saying things like,
5658340	5660540	wow, with such a, for a B or something like that
5660540	5662500	with such a tiny brain, it does a,
5662500	5666620	well, we don't know how much it takes to be a single self.
5666620	5668740	We don't have any way of guessing what that's gonna be
5668740	5670580	until you already know what a human is.
5670580	5672460	So let's look at this example.
5672460	5676020	This is a schematic of an early blastoderm
5676020	5680260	of an amniote embryo, let's say it's a bird or a human.
5680260	5681660	And what you see is a bunch of cells.
5681660	5684420	There's 50,000 cells and we look at that
5684420	5686620	and we say, oh, there's an embryo.
5686620	5688220	Now, what are we counting when we say
5688220	5689460	there's one embryo there?
5689460	5690900	What is there one of?
5690900	5692740	There are tens of thousands of cells.
5692740	5693940	What is there one of?
5693940	5696380	What we're actually counting is alignment.
5696380	5698380	We're counting the fact that all of these,
5698380	5700100	and that alignment is literal
5700100	5702180	because the cells physically have to align with each other
5702180	5704800	and also alignment in morphogenetic space
5704800	5707100	because all of these cells normally
5707100	5710060	are going to work together to build one individual.
5710060	5711940	They have one particular large scale pattern
5711940	5712940	that they're all going to build
5712940	5715300	and that is what we're counting as one.
5715300	5718660	And now, could you guess in advance
5718660	5720540	how many embryos there are
5720540	5723020	or how many individuals are in this brain?
5723020	5725020	It's a very similar as I was saying before
5725020	5727740	with the Turing, the kind of allusion to Turing.
5727740	5729700	It's a very similar problem.
5729700	5731900	Can you tell how many are going to be in there?
5731900	5734040	Is it genetically specified how many are in there?
5734040	5735700	Well, the answer is it is not.
5735700	5739940	So here's an experiment that Lutz first did
5739940	5742220	in the 40s and I used to do as a grad student
5742220	5743860	in the duck embryo.
5743860	5746060	So what you can do is you can take a little needle
5746060	5748860	and you can put some scratches in this blastoderm.
5748860	5750120	And so what happens is that once you,
5750120	5751980	when you made those little scratches
5751980	5753700	until they heal up, which they will,
5753700	5756400	but until they heal up, every region
5756400	5759360	which does not feel the presence of these other regions
5759360	5760220	becomes an embryo.
5760220	5763200	It self-organizes an embryo and then it heals.
5763200	5765640	And then what you have is multiple areas
5765640	5767980	that are conjoined twins or triplets.
5767980	5769420	And then in between them,
5769420	5771660	you have these little weird little disputed zones
5771660	5773820	where these cells can't quite tell who they belong to,
5773820	5775220	but in the end they have to make a decision
5775220	5777220	and they become part of this or part of that.
5777220	5781500	And this is really, there are a couple
5781500	5782340	of interesting things here.
5782340	5784260	First of all, because of this,
5784260	5788500	because you can split this up into some number of islands,
5788500	5791580	the number of cells, just imagine this is a human embryo,
5791580	5795020	the number of individuals in there is not fixed.
5795020	5797380	It is not determined by the genetics.
5797380	5800820	It is set in real time by the physiology.
5800820	5803060	It could be zero, it could be one, it could be two,
5803060	5805860	it could be some number of embryos,
5805860	5807700	probably up to half a dozen, let's say.
5808780	5813780	And it's very important for the making of cells
5815140	5817340	that they are self-organized,
5817340	5818580	meaning that they don't know,
5818580	5820780	each cell does not know where it,
5820780	5825080	where every cell is some other cells external environment.
5825080	5827680	So where do I end and my neighbor begins?
5827680	5830720	Or where do I end and the outside world begins?
5830720	5831960	This is something that is not true
5831960	5835920	for almost any current AI or robotic system,
5835920	5837920	because they don't have to put themselves together
5837920	5839880	from scratch, they are told right from the beginning,
5839880	5840720	they're programmed to say,
5840720	5842080	this is your border, here are the inputs,
5842080	5843920	here are the outputs, you are here,
5843920	5845200	the outside world is there.
5845200	5846920	That is not the case for living beings.
5846920	5850720	We have to self-construct and we do not know right away
5850720	5852840	where our borders are, how many of us are in there
5852840	5853680	and so on.
5854680	5857080	This also taking it back to the brain, of course,
5857080	5859200	is this issue of individuation,
5859200	5861880	because in split brain patients
5861880	5863680	and dissociative disorders and so on,
5863680	5866840	you find out that there actually are more than one self
5866840	5868520	within a standard human brain,
5868520	5870800	how many could fit in there, we do not know,
5870800	5874320	but the record for these dissociative kind of cases,
5874320	5877120	I mean, I think I've read in the 60s,
5877120	5879360	60 different personalities that could be in there.
5879440	5883840	So this idea of an active medium,
5883840	5886960	an excitable medium that differentiates
5886960	5891960	into a number of coherent selves is really key.
5892680	5895240	And so now you have to start asking yourself, okay,
5895240	5899680	so as we are self-constructing out of this,
5899680	5902960	sort of this Freudian ocean of possibility,
5902960	5905480	some out of 20 or 50,000 cells,
5905480	5907680	three or two or one embryo will form,
5908520	5913120	what are the dynamics that actually allow individual cells
5913120	5914960	with their own tiny little goals,
5914960	5916080	what are the goals of cells?
5916080	5918000	Well, every cell wants to become two cells
5918000	5919440	and they have metabolic goals
5919440	5920760	that they try to meet and so on.
5920760	5922800	What allows them to scale up
5922800	5927800	to work towards very sort of a large complex goals
5928680	5929760	like building a whole embryo?
5929760	5930600	I mean, that's huge.
5930600	5932760	No individual cell can know what a whole embryo is,
5932760	5933880	but the collective does.
5933880	5935320	So what allows that?
5935320	5936440	Well, here are some hypotheses.
5936440	5938680	One thing that allows it, I think,
5938680	5940960	is the kind of memory wiping that happens
5940960	5943040	when cells are electrically connected.
5943040	5944760	Because when two cells signal each other
5944760	5945600	the old-fashioned way,
5945600	5947720	where they just sort of secrete a chemical molecule
5947720	5949680	and it comes over here and the cell senses it,
5949680	5951240	it's very easy for this cell to know
5951240	5953720	whether that signal came from the outside or not.
5953720	5954680	So they can maintain,
5954680	5956680	these two cells can maintain their individuality
5956680	5958400	and they can maintain different memories
5958400	5959920	and the cell can ignore the signal
5959920	5962320	or do something about it, whatever.
5962320	5964040	But there's something magic
5964040	5965560	about these electrical gap junctions.
5965560	5968600	When the cells are joined by these gap junctions,
5968600	5972360	this signal, let's say it's a calcium spike
5972360	5973200	from being injured.
5973200	5974600	This cell got poked with something
5974600	5977440	and this calcium spike is a trace of that event,
5977440	5979320	a kind of a memory n-gram of that event.
5979320	5982080	It will immediately propagate through these gap junctions
5982080	5985480	and that the interpretation of that signal for this cell
5987440	5989840	is exactly the same as it would before
5989840	5991400	its own calcium spike.
5991400	5993440	Calcium doesn't have any metadata on it
5993440	5994960	that says, where did you come from?
5995000	5996640	So by moving through this,
5996640	5998520	there's a kind of memory,
5998520	6000800	kind of identity wipe that happens
6000800	6003080	where this cell now has that same memory trace.
6003080	6004320	And as far as it's concerned,
6004320	6005800	that's its own natural memory.
6005800	6008280	It has no way of knowing that's a false memory.
6008280	6010240	So to this cell, that's a false memory,
6010240	6011560	but to the collective,
6011560	6014840	it is an absolutely true memory that the collective had.
6014840	6017000	So that kind of wiping property,
6017000	6019160	it strips ownership information.
6019160	6022320	It makes it very hard for each cell
6022320	6024320	to maintain an individual identity
6024320	6026040	with respect to what its history was.
6026040	6028640	And it makes collectives out of individual cells.
6028640	6030760	And of course it makes them bigger.
6030760	6032760	So my memory become our memories,
6032760	6035040	my stress state becomes our stress
6035040	6037000	and my goal becomes our goal.
6037000	6041040	And so by when a single cell in this diagram,
6041040	6044240	when a single cell has some size of a cognitive light going
6044240	6046800	and some ability to anticipate and remember,
6046800	6051800	a network of these cells has a bigger computational capacity
6052320	6054840	and a bigger spatial sensorium.
6054840	6057440	And it can actually have larger scale,
6057440	6060360	more complex states as set points.
6060360	6062320	And now you can start to see how a collection of cells
6062320	6064320	could actually work on something like building an arm
6064320	6066000	or building a whole body.
6066000	6067240	And so we can imagine,
6067240	6068360	and so we're doing this now
6068360	6072240	is doing these very specific computational models
6072240	6075760	of how little tiny homeostatic loops like this,
6075760	6079160	for example, measure the pH and act
6079160	6081920	become very large homeostatic loops
6081920	6083280	about something completely different.
6083280	6085960	Single cells cannot remember anything like this,
6085960	6088840	but a giant collection of cells could.
6088840	6090720	And so this is a very active area of research
6090720	6093760	is to figure out exactly how that scales up.
6093760	6096760	The implications are these,
6096760	6098240	here's what evolution has done.
6098240	6101200	Evolution has enabled single cells to work together
6101200	6103320	to enlarge their cognitive light cones
6103320	6107240	where the goals scale from the very humble goals
6107280	6111040	of single cells to the more grandiose goals of collectives
6111040	6112960	where they can work on something gigantic
6112960	6114640	like making sure you have four fingers.
6114640	6116560	This cell doesn't know anything about what a finger is,
6116560	6118440	but this collective does.
6118440	6120080	So evolution gave us the scale up,
6120080	6121800	but there's a failure mode to this.
6121800	6123200	The failure mode is cancer.
6123200	6126520	So here's where when these cells
6126520	6128880	are electrically isolated from each other,
6128880	6132080	this is human glioblastoma in culture.
6132080	6134000	So these individual cells can roll back
6134000	6136760	to their unicellular past.
6136760	6138360	They do not become more selfish.
6138360	6140800	A lot of game theory kind of approaches
6140800	6142800	treat cancer cells as more selfish.
6142800	6144120	They don't become more selfish.
6144120	6145760	Their cells get smaller.
6145760	6146600	They're just a selfish.
6146600	6148440	It's just that the self here is huge.
6148440	6152040	Their self is very tiny and they do the best they can.
6152040	6156360	But biometically, if you have that kind of weird perspective
6156360	6159920	on cancer as a disorder of selfhood,
6159920	6162320	then what you can do is something interesting.
6162320	6164720	And we did this years ago.
6165720	6168880	You can induce tumors using human oncogenes,
6168880	6170720	but what you can do is use these ion channels
6170720	6173440	to force the cells to be in the correct electrical state
6173440	6175520	to maintain proper communication.
6175520	6177920	And when you do that, even though the oncogene is blazingly
6177920	6179200	expressed, it's labeled in red here.
6179200	6180760	You can see it's all over the place.
6180760	6181440	There's no tumor.
6181440	6182640	This is the same animal.
6182640	6186280	There's no tumor because the genetics might have a defect.
6186280	6188080	The hardware might be a little bit broken.
6188080	6190520	But as long as the cell is physiologically
6190520	6193520	part of this network that contains large scale
6193520	6196720	goals like building nice skin, nice muscle, and so on,
6196720	6198760	they're kept away from tumorogenesis
6198760	6202880	and harness towards these large scale anatomical goals.
6202880	6207800	So the last piece I want to show you, it goes beyond this.
6207800	6210640	So we've been talking about goals in different spaces.
6210640	6213760	So the tiny metabolic goals of single cells,
6213760	6217560	the morphogenetic goals of cellular collectives.
6217560	6220680	And now we can ask the following question.
6220680	6222360	Where do these goals come from?
6222360	6225760	And what other goals can novel beings have?
6225760	6227480	And so this is a project that I also
6227480	6231040	have to do a disclosure here because Josh Bongard and I
6231040	6233200	have another company called Fauna Systems, which is all
6233200	6236520	about AI-designed biorebotics.
6236520	6239280	And this is all work done in collaboration
6239280	6242680	with a Bongard lab at this Institute of Computationally
6242680	6244520	Designed Organisms.
6244520	6248120	We asked the following question, how much plasticity
6248120	6249000	do these cells have?
6249000	6251040	And when they're liberated from their normal boundary
6251040	6254040	conditions of the animal, what will they do?
6254040	6255920	How will they reboot multicellularity?
6255920	6259120	How will they navigate anatomical and behavioral spaces?
6259120	6260160	What can they do?
6260160	6262240	So here's the experiment.
6262240	6264720	And all the biology here was done by Douglas Blackest
6264720	6266280	and the staff scientists in the group.
6266280	6268520	What we did was we took an early frog embryo.
6268520	6273480	And at this stage, where they have about 1,000 cells or so,
6273480	6279000	we cut off these cells up here, which are the skin.
6279000	6281960	This is all faded to be skin cells.
6281960	6285920	And we dissociated them and we put them back
6285920	6288000	in this little depression here.
6288000	6289560	And so they're just skin.
6289560	6290080	There's no nerve.
6290080	6291800	There's no muscle, just skin.
6291800	6293600	And what could they have done?
6293600	6294680	Well, they could have died.
6294680	6298240	They could have spread out and gotten away from each other.
6298240	6300240	They could have formed a nice two-dimensional monolayer,
6300240	6301680	the way that cell culture does.
6301680	6304280	What they did instead was something quite different.
6304280	6305800	Oops.
6306240	6309200	What they did instead, after we put them
6309200	6311680	in this little depression, all these little skin cells,
6311680	6316120	they got together and they formed this round thing
6316120	6317960	we call a xenobot.
6317960	6319880	It's called a xenobot because Xenopus lavus
6319880	6320720	is the name of the frog.
6320720	6323520	And we think it's a biorebotics platform, so xenobot.
6323520	6325680	What they do is these little guys
6325680	6330200	achieve spontaneous motion by using their cilia.
6330200	6332280	So frog skin has little hairs, little,
6332280	6333720	motile hairs called cilia, which it
6333760	6336600	uses to distribute mucus down the side of the animal.
6336600	6339360	So instead, what they do is they use it to row against the water.
6339360	6340520	So they start to swim.
6340520	6341600	So they can go in circles.
6341600	6346320	They can patrol back and forth like this.
6346320	6347880	They can have these collective behaviors
6347880	6349240	where they can go on a long journey
6349240	6350760	or they can interact with each other
6350760	6353960	or they can sit there doing nothing.
6353960	6355880	They have all kinds of behaviors.
6355880	6360080	Here's one moving in a maze in water.
6360080	6361800	So you'll see what it does as it goes.
6361840	6364080	It takes the corner without bumping into anything.
6364080	6366680	And then at this point, it spontaneously decides to turn around
6366680	6367960	and go back where it came from.
6367960	6369000	We are not pacing it.
6369000	6370200	We are not controlling it.
6370200	6372280	There are no, there's no neurons here.
6372280	6377160	This is a piece of skin living its own, its new best life.
6377160	6381400	And you're watching some of its behaviors.
6381400	6386560	It has all kinds of active calcium signaling.
6386560	6390360	This is the same technology used to read out brain signaling.
6390440	6392800	We are currently in the process of trying to decode all this
6392800	6394720	to see what the cells are saying to each other.
6394720	6396720	What are these two, what if anything
6396720	6398920	are these two Xenobots saying to each other?
6398920	6400120	They can regenerate.
6400120	6402720	So if you cut them almost in half, they will seal up.
6402720	6403560	So look at this.
6403560	6405680	So here's like 180 degree hinge right there.
6405680	6408720	Look at the power it takes to fold itself back
6408720	6411040	into its new Xenobot shape.
6411040	6413640	And something else that's amazing is by modeling.
6413640	6417320	And so Josh Bongard and Sam Kriegman in his lab
6417320	6418960	did a bunch of computational modeling
6419000	6421520	in the simulator of these bots running around.
6421520	6424280	And they noticed a kind of unusual predicted behavior
6424280	6427240	that they tend to rearrange their environment
6427240	6428080	in this weird way.
6428080	6430560	So they went, so we went ahead and we built some of the ones.
6430560	6433400	Then again, Doug sculpted some of these things
6433400	6435320	in ways that the AI suggested.
6435320	6437800	And we discovered something remarkable,
6437800	6439960	which is called kinematic replication.
6441360	6444480	Notice that we've made it impossible for these animals
6444480	6446760	to reproduce in the normal froggy fashion.
6446760	6447920	They don't have any other things there.
6447920	6449080	They're just skin.
6449080	6451880	But within a couple of days,
6451880	6455920	they discover a novel way of making copies of themselves
6455920	6457560	that's basically Von Neumann's dream.
6457560	6460480	It's able to construct copies of itself
6460480	6462680	from material it finds in the environment.
6462680	6465680	So this white stuff here, these are all loose skin cells
6465680	6467800	that we sprinkled into their world.
6467800	6469120	What they do is they run around
6469120	6472240	and they both collectively and individually,
6472240	6474480	they collect them into little balls
6474480	6476440	and then they sort of polish these little balls
6476440	6477800	and compact them.
6477800	6480840	And because they're not working with a passive,
6480840	6482560	some kind of passive particle,
6482560	6484920	they're working with an agential material,
6484920	6487160	just like we were the engineers,
6487160	6489400	Doug Blackison was working with an agential material,
6489400	6490880	these cells that have an agenda,
6490880	6493160	they like to assemble into the xenobot.
6493160	6497200	These little blobs become the next generation of xenobots.
6497200	6498040	And guess what they do?
6498040	6499360	They run around and collect more cells
6499360	6503240	and they become the next generation of xenobots and so on.
6503240	6506640	And so this ability to make copies of itself
6506640	6508760	using kinematic replication is just one of them.
6508760	6511480	We're just scratching the surface here of what they can do.
6511480	6514040	There is much, much more coming.
6514040	6519040	And so this suggests an interesting set of questions.
6520040	6525040	What did the frog genome actually learn during evolution?
6525200	6526680	Well, it can make frogs, sure,
6526680	6528880	and this is the normal tadpole path,
6528880	6529920	but it turns out,
6529920	6531480	and something we would have never known
6531480	6533840	if we hadn't tried this experiment,
6533840	6535280	it actually can do other things.
6535280	6537400	It can make the exact same genome.
6537400	6539240	We didn't edit the genome here.
6539240	6541480	We didn't give them any weird new nanomaterials.
6542560	6545840	The same genome can have a different developmental path.
6545840	6547880	This is what an old xenobot looks like.
6547880	6551680	I mean, it has this weird structure
6551680	6553400	that who knows what it's changing into.
6553400	6554920	And then it has different behaviors
6554920	6557600	that's different from what tadpoles do.
6557600	6559360	So here's some interesting things about it.
6559360	6562400	First of all, for any other creature,
6562400	6565560	when you ask why does it look the way it looks?
6565560	6568360	Why does it have certain behaviors and properties?
6568360	6570160	The answer is always the same, well, evolution.
6570160	6571240	So selection, right?
6571240	6576240	So for eons, the system was shaped,
6578320	6580360	it was selected for specific behaviors,
6580360	6582320	everything else died out and there you go.
6582320	6585000	But here, you can't use that story here
6585000	6586720	because there's never been any xenobots.
6586720	6589280	There has never been any selection to be a good xenobot.
6589280	6593040	Where did these capacities come from?
6593040	6596760	Where did their ability to do kinematic self-replication,
6596760	6597600	which to our knowledge,
6597600	6599240	doesn't exist anywhere in the biosphere,
6599240	6600640	where did that come from?
6600640	6604040	Now, we don't know what their cognitive capacities are.
6604040	6605040	We're studying that right now.
6605040	6605880	What can they sense?
6605880	6606720	Do they have preferences?
6606720	6607920	How can they learn?
6607920	6610280	We don't know any of that yet.
6610280	6612200	But we do know that they have novel morphologies
6612200	6614440	and novel behaviors and so where does that come from?
6614440	6616920	So one way to think about this
6616920	6620880	and that same genome by being probed in this way
6620880	6622720	is showing us a bit of the latent space,
6622720	6624320	a bit of what they are capable of.
6624320	6626400	So this is kind of, you know, Jeremy Gay,
6626400	6627840	who's an amazing graphic designer
6627840	6629400	that does a lot of our artwork,
6629400	6632880	did this homage to the famous Hofstadter book,
6632880	6633920	Gerd Lescher Bach,
6634840	6639840	where he was pointing out that how you look at certain objects
6642760	6644800	reveals what you see and what they can do.
6644800	6646640	And so through that frog genome,
6646680	6648640	when you look through it in a particular way,
6648640	6650840	yes, you can see the tadpoles
6650840	6652000	and yes, you can see xenobots
6652000	6653880	and maybe you can see other things.
6653880	6656160	And so what we can say here
6656160	6660480	is that these kind of synthetic organisms
6660480	6661880	are really a tool.
6661880	6664120	They're almost like a periscope or a telescope
6664120	6666880	that lets you look into another space
6666880	6669760	that we normally don't see into the space of possibilities
6669760	6671720	or for example, anatomical structure.
6671720	6672920	And so for the last couple of minutes,
6672920	6674040	I just wanna talk about this
6674040	6677920	and the future of all this in bioengineering and so on.
6677920	6680320	And the concepts that we wanna talk about are these.
6680320	6682160	We've already talked about multiscale
6682160	6683560	competency architecture.
6683560	6684960	This idea of polycomputing,
6684960	6688720	which Josh Bongard and I came up with to indicate
6688720	6690760	the fact that any physical process
6690760	6692560	can be treated as a computation,
6692560	6694680	as a different computation by different observers,
6694680	6696680	depending on how they interpret it.
6696680	6700280	And that these observers ourselves observing each other
6700280	6703480	and various conspecifics and parasites and so on,
6704560	6707200	this idea that really because of this competency,
6707200	6710400	because cells and tissues are not a passive material,
6710400	6714360	every part is able to hack all the other parts
6714360	6717480	by providing signals that exploit their functionality.
6717480	6719000	Just like we as engineers,
6719000	6720840	and that whole middle part of the talk,
6720840	6722360	I was trying to show you that
6722360	6726240	triggering complex organ formation and so on,
6726240	6730280	you don't have to try to micromanage the molecular steps.
6730280	6732660	If you can communicate with a larger system
6732660	6734060	to tell it what you want it to do,
6734060	6735340	you can take advantage of that.
6735340	6738860	Well, biology, we're late to that party as engineers,
6738860	6741020	and biology has been doing this all along.
6741020	6743260	So I wanna show you a couple of examples.
6743260	6745740	The first thing I wanna just mention is,
6745740	6748660	building with a gentile materials is very different.
6748660	6750380	So when you build with a passive material,
6750380	6751700	like making Legos,
6751700	6754500	it's on you to put every Lego where it goes.
6754500	6755980	All they do is hold shape.
6755980	6757540	They have very little competencies
6757540	6758660	besides holding their shape.
6758660	6759940	So you have to control everything.
6759940	6761540	This is molecular medicine.
6761540	6764420	This is synthetic biology now.
6764420	6765580	This is bioengineering.
6765580	6767820	You build everything yourself.
6767820	6769780	But so if you wanted to make a tower out of Legos,
6769780	6771740	you have to put everything where it goes.
6771740	6772580	It's easy.
6772580	6773380	There are a few surprises,
6773380	6776280	but the problem is if it falls down, that's it.
6776280	6779340	You could try to make a tower out of dogs, for example.
6779340	6780260	If you made a tower out of,
6780260	6781500	if you tried it the old fashioned way
6781500	6784220	by stacking dogs on top of each other, that doesn't work.
6784220	6785820	The dogs have their own agendas.
6785820	6787860	They're gonna walk off, not gonna work.
6787860	6789740	But there's a new set of tools
6790740	6793860	basically from different parts of this spectrum
6793860	6794700	that we talked about,
6794700	6797780	different ways of interacting with systems.
6797780	6800140	If you don't insist on treating them as this kind of system,
6800140	6802340	but you're open to the idea that your material
6802340	6804380	might actually be this kind of system.
6804380	6806020	And in the case of dogs, it's very obvious.
6806020	6808380	In the case of cells, it's only now becoming apparent
6808380	6811900	that they are also somewhere here.
6811900	6813500	What you can do is train the dogs.
6813500	6814820	It's a very different strategy.
6814820	6816900	You're now doing behavior shaping
6816900	6818600	as opposed to old school engineering.
6818600	6821360	But the good news is that this tower repairs itself
6821360	6823720	when you knock it down, they'll get right back up.
6823720	6826200	And so the question about this competency is,
6826200	6828280	what can you expect the subunits to do
6828280	6830000	when you're not there to manage them?
6830000	6831960	And how do you construct complex things
6831960	6833600	out of units like that?
6833600	6837000	And the way you do it is by using their natural interface,
6837000	6839280	in this case, learning rewards and punishments
6839280	6840800	to control their behavior.
6840800	6841880	This is hacking.
6841880	6844360	Hacking not in the sense of the people
6844360	6845640	who steal your credit card numbers,
6845640	6848000	but in the sense of using a system
6848000	6851720	in not necessarily the way that it was intended to be used,
6851720	6853640	but in some clever way that exploits
6853640	6857960	the system's own properties for a complex outcome.
6857960	6860120	So we see this all the time in behavioral science, right?
6860120	6862080	So there are these crazy parasites,
6862080	6866040	this toxoplasma that causes animals and humans
6866040	6867960	to become less risk averse.
6867960	6869400	So captains of industry and people
6869400	6871760	who die on motorcycle accidents going too fast
6871760	6873520	tend to be infected with this stuff
6873560	6878560	because it actually changes your risk aversion level.
6878720	6882640	And we've got a fungus that controls ant behavior
6882640	6883480	and so on.
6883480	6887000	So we know that creatures hack each other's behavioral policies
6887000	6889440	for navigating three-dimensional space,
6889440	6890280	but that's not all.
6890280	6892600	What we're now starting to understand
6892600	6895760	is that they're really interesting hacks
6895760	6899080	that happen in anatomical and physiological spaces.
6899080	6902160	In order to do that, the material, right?
6902160	6903280	It's a gentle matter.
6903280	6906520	The material on which evolution works,
6906520	6910240	so cells and tissues, has to have these various competencies.
6910240	6911160	It has to have memories.
6911160	6913640	It has to be able to measure things to take in inputs.
6913640	6916920	You can't hack something that doesn't have any of that,
6916920	6917920	but life does.
6917920	6919280	And I wanna show you a couple of examples
6919280	6921240	of this plasticity.
6921240	6924000	So here is, and this is not Photoshop,
6924000	6927160	this is, these are real animals.
6927160	6930400	These are flies and on their wings,
6930400	6932720	they are running a kind of stripped down
6932720	6934320	ant morphogenetic program,
6934320	6936640	like a two-dimensional ant morphogenetic program.
6936640	6938680	And the reason they do it is because when they flap their
6938680	6940000	wings in a particular pattern,
6940000	6941360	it looks like ants scurrying around
6941360	6943280	and their predators don't wanna deal with the ants
6943280	6945040	and they scare them off.
6945040	6948120	So it's kind of amazing that on their wings,
6948120	6951640	they're able to have these very specific patterns,
6951640	6953400	but it's no more amazing than the fly itself.
6953400	6956000	I mean, this is just a simplified version
6956000	6957720	of what the fly itself is doing,
6957720	6959000	but it's in computer sciences,
6959000	6960280	would be kind of virtualization.
6960280	6962680	The fact that the same tissue can actually make
6962680	6965000	different kinds of patterns.
6965000	6967080	Now, I wanna show you one of my favorite examples
6967080	6969400	of that kind of hacking.
6969400	6971240	This is the traditional thing that happens.
6971240	6974040	So here's an acorn and we know that what acorns,
6974040	6977280	acorn genomes know how to do is make acorn,
6977280	6978880	is make oak leaves.
6978880	6980560	So they're green, they're flat,
6980560	6981880	they have this particular structure.
6981880	6984000	This is what that genome does.
6984000	6987040	Turns out that with just a little bit of prompting
6987080	6990320	from a wasp, these cells are also able
6990320	6992520	to make something like this or like this.
6992520	6993520	These are galls.
6993520	6995840	These are made by the plant cell
6995840	6999280	that is infected by this parasite.
6999280	7001480	The parasite is hacking these plant cells
7001480	7003680	to get them to build something completely different.
7003680	7006160	Would we have any clue that these flat green cells
7006160	7007920	are able to build something like this
7007920	7009480	if we didn't see this example?
7009480	7011680	So this is another one of these cases
7011680	7015400	where you need to do perturbation experiments.
7015400	7017760	In this case, this is a natural one done by this wasp
7017760	7021520	to see the latent space of what the system is competent to,
7021520	7022480	what is it capable of?
7022480	7023920	What else can these cells do?
7023920	7025960	And can you imagine all the things that these plant cells
7025960	7028320	could do if they can build this kind of stuff?
7028320	7032800	So just to finish up here, to really,
7032800	7036040	I think all of this pushes in a particular direction,
7036040	7037640	kind of again, going back to the sort of
7037640	7041720	philosophical side of things, is this an organism?
7041720	7043400	It's got a body and it's got some sort of
7043400	7047120	cognitive architecture, this frog, is this an organism?
7047120	7049520	We tend to think so because we as humans
7049520	7053560	have really tiny little observational slits
7053560	7055040	through which we see the world.
7055040	7058840	We like things that happen not too slowly
7058840	7060200	and not too quickly.
7060200	7064040	We only can perceive in a certain range
7064040	7067680	and thus we only see the animal right here,
7067680	7071440	but we now have tools like the xenobot and others
7071440	7073320	that can collapse the bigger picture,
7073320	7075360	which we normally are pretty blind to,
7075360	7077440	into a scale we can actually appreciate
7077440	7080600	because this is not the organism, this is the organism.
7080600	7085120	It's the cells plus all of the things that can manipulate
7085120	7087400	them to do various interesting things.
7087400	7089760	It's also the evolutionary cycle wrapped around it.
7089760	7091920	It's complex beings like us engineers,
7091920	7095440	simple beings like various microbes and the parasites,
7095440	7098320	and of course the low agency aspects
7098320	7100200	of the environment like chemicals.
7100200	7103360	Why do I say all of this is part of the organism?
7103360	7105800	Because if you don't understand all this other stuff,
7105800	7107080	you really do not understand
7107080	7108760	what else these cells are capable of.
7108760	7111080	This manifestation is the default.
7111080	7112760	It is the most common thing,
7112760	7116360	but we are completely blind to all of what it's capable of.
7116360	7119520	If we do not understand the other inputs into the system,
7119520	7121360	and this is somebody else had mentioned
7121360	7123200	that the environment and the context,
7123200	7124520	I mean, they're not always there.
7124520	7128240	In fact, we need to explore all kinds
7128960	7130920	of ones that don't naturally exist
7130920	7133920	to really understand what this organism is.
7133920	7138480	And so the Xenobot is really a kind of tool
7138480	7141480	you can use to peer into other spaces.
7141480	7143600	They'll be physiological, the transcriptional.
7143600	7144560	I mean, we're studying now
7144560	7146280	what the transcriptome of these Xenobots.
7146280	7149480	It is not like the transcriptome of frog embryos, by the way.
7150640	7151520	This is what it is.
7151520	7153480	The environment is full of affordances.
7153480	7154800	Some of them low agency,
7154800	7157400	some of them rather high agency and everything in between.
7157400	7161160	And all of this is part of what actually defines
7161160	7162880	what a complex organism is.
7162880	7165680	So having seen all this, just to end here,
7165680	7166520	having seen all this,
7166520	7171280	I will point out that all of the biological natural forms
7171280	7174000	that Darwin was impressed by when he said
7174000	7175720	endless forms, most beautiful,
7175720	7179560	all of that N of one run down the tree of life
7179560	7182440	is a tiny region, just a tiny region
7182440	7185280	of the state space of all possible beings
7185280	7186920	because life is so interoperable
7186920	7188200	and so hackable.
7188200	7190800	Pretty much every combination of evolved materials,
7190800	7193400	so DNA cells and so on, designed material.
7193400	7196840	So active matter of various smart appliances and so on.
7196840	7199640	And software, any combination of those three things
7199640	7202000	is going to be some viable being operating
7202000	7205560	in some kind of set of spaces with some cognitive system.
7205560	7210120	So cyborgs, hybrids, various kinds of chimeras,
7210120	7211600	various kinds of robotics,
7211600	7213560	all of these things are somewhere
7213560	7216240	in this giant space of possible minds.
7216280	7218440	And this has massive implications for us
7218440	7220320	on a societal level.
7220320	7223840	Because going forward, none of the concepts
7223840	7226160	that we grew up with, the sharp distinction
7226160	7228800	between humans and non-humans,
7228800	7230520	between machines and living beings,
7230520	7234640	between intelligence and sort of faking intelligence,
7234640	7236800	none of these categories are gonna make it
7236800	7238800	through the next couple of decades.
7238800	7242000	We need to scrap all of that towards a continuous view
7242000	7245000	and a new system of ethics that does not depend
7245000	7247200	on the two things that we used to depend on.
7247200	7249720	In the olden days, you could ask,
7249720	7252080	what are you made of and how did you get here?
7252080	7254080	Meaning evolved versus engineered.
7254080	7255880	And based on that, you could make a decision
7255880	7257560	of how to ethically relate to something,
7257560	7258720	you sort of knock on it.
7258720	7260200	And if you hear a metallic clangy sound,
7260200	7262080	you would say that, ah, you come from a factory,
7262080	7263000	you're gonna be pretty boring,
7263000	7265000	I can take you apart, whatever.
7265000	7266640	None of those things are gonna be good anymore
7266640	7270400	because we need to develop novel ways
7270400	7273880	to recognize and to relate to beings
7273880	7276720	that are nowhere with us on the tree of life.
7276720	7279400	They are, we simply cannot judge them that way.
7279400	7282000	And this is going to be an exciting
7282000	7283800	and grand challenge for the species
7283800	7288680	to get beyond a very simplistic view of agency
7288680	7293000	towards a more expansive compassion towards other beings
7293000	7295800	of radically different composition and provenance.
7295800	7299360	So I'll stop here and just say that lots of papers
7299360	7301320	that go deeply into all of the things
7301320	7303760	that I sort of briefly went over,
7303760	7307720	in terms of machines and everything else.
7307720	7310280	I'm gonna thank the people who did all the work.
7310280	7313280	So these are the postdocs and graduate students
7313280	7316160	who did all of the work that I showed you today.
7316160	7320320	Many collaborators are various funders,
7320320	7321480	the disclosures again.
7322400	7325520	Jeremy Gay did all the amazing graphics
7325520	7327760	and most of all the animal model systems
7327760	7329680	because they do all the heavy lifting
7329680	7330840	in teaching us about these things.
7330840	7334640	So thank you so much and I will take questions.
7334640	7335480	That's wonderful.
7335480	7338880	Thank you so much, Michael, for your presentation
7338880	7340360	and for your work.
7340360	7343160	I mean, the implications are outstanding.
7343160	7345840	So thank you so much.
7345840	7349120	Given the time, are you okay maybe to take five, 10 minutes?
7349120	7350840	Yeah, yeah, sure.
7350840	7352400	It's my fault that we went over the two hours.
7352400	7355480	So yeah, no, no, no, we all wanted to listen.
7355480	7357600	Yeah, if anybody has questions, I'm here.
7357600	7360640	Sure, let's go for Richard first.
7360640	7361760	Well, thank you very much.
7361760	7364160	I'm a non-scientist and a poet.
7365400	7369280	And I found this absolutely fascinating in every respect
7370240	7373400	and you zipped through it at enormous speeds.
7373400	7377640	So I've only been able mentally and hourly
7377640	7380000	to take in part of what you've said.
7381880	7385840	So I've just got a very simple non-scientific question.
7386840	7388680	Right at the end, you said,
7388680	7391080	we have, all of this opens up
7394640	7397800	our distinctions between what is machine
7397800	7402640	and what is biological, what is non-biological,
7402640	7405120	et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.
7405120	7408680	And you mentioned all of your work
7408680	7412840	posits the demand for a new ethics.
7413960	7416320	So this is a personal question to you.
7416560	7419400	And I raise it because all the way along,
7419400	7424400	I've been having all sorts of little ethical quarrels
7424520	7428360	with myself, not just with you,
7428360	7430560	but with everything that you've said.
7430560	7433120	So can I just ask a personal question?
7433120	7438120	What are your own personal ethics vis-a-vis the work you're doing
7440280	7443320	and vis-a-vis the directions
7443360	7446400	in which you see the future happening?
7446400	7448280	And what I've got in mind here, of course,
7448280	7452000	is that you have spoken about the benefits
7452000	7454080	of this kind of work,
7454080	7459080	but we all know that scientific advances can be used by,
7459440	7463960	let's say, evil people or people who want to use
7463960	7467720	and manipulate materials to their own set
7467720	7470360	for their old selfish needs.
7470360	7471760	So where does that come in?
7471760	7476760	And are we in the region of Mary Shelley's Frankenstein?
7480920	7485920	Are we in the region of Promethean attacks on the gods?
7492960	7495440	There's a few things going on in my head,
7495440	7498600	but it really comes down to, I think,
7498600	7500480	to ethics and your own views.
7502760	7505880	I think that's just enormous admiration
7505880	7509360	and thanks for everything that you've given us so far.
7509360	7510440	Well, thank you so much.
7510440	7511280	I appreciate it.
7511280	7514800	I must say I love your background as you can see.
7514800	7516360	I have a lot of affinity to that.
7516360	7518000	So thank you.
7518000	7520360	Let's see, here's what I want to start with
7520360	7522320	and I will answer all of that,
7522320	7524040	but here's what I want to start with.
7524040	7527080	There's a standard kind of view
7527080	7531360	that even implicitly underlies a lot of the concern
7531360	7533800	when people ask me about these things,
7533800	7537560	which is basically this, everything is fine
7537560	7539960	and you scientists better not do something
7539960	7541560	to really screw it up.
7541560	7544280	That is kind of the mainstream assumption.
7544280	7548760	And that was sort of understandable back in the day
7548760	7552400	when we really could think that things were created
7552400	7554960	by someone for us to be the best that they could be
7554960	7557200	and really we ought not to screw it up.
7557200	7561280	But I think now, I think it's safe to say
7561280	7563920	that we have a different vision and this is my vision.
7564920	7566840	Things are absolutely not fine.
7566840	7570400	And I'm not talking about just the environmental,
7570400	7573200	various environmental calamities, but I get,
7573200	7574800	and I'm not a clinician,
7574800	7579400	but I receive daily phone calls and emails
7579400	7582960	from people in the most unbelievable biomedical suffering.
7582960	7584800	I mean, my kid has a birth defect.
7584800	7586640	I got a tumor, I lost a limb.
7586640	7588000	I mean, you can't imagine.
7588000	7590280	So people call me every day with this stuff
7590280	7594800	and our ability to address that degree of suffering
7594800	7598480	and to improve people's opportunity
7598480	7601600	to reach their potential given the limitations
7601600	7604040	of being born, even in a healthy body, right?
7604040	7609040	These limitations, I consider us to be so far off of fine
7611000	7613960	that it's, I can't even begin to describe that.
7613960	7616440	I think we are not starting here
7616440	7619200	and hoping that we don't drop, we are down here.
7619240	7623240	And to me, so here's my ethics to get back to your question.
7623240	7625480	When people ask me what keeps me up at night
7625480	7627360	about all this stuff as an ethical concern,
7627360	7629240	here's what keeps me up at night.
7629240	7634240	It's the possibility of failure to live up to the promise
7636880	7638520	of using this kind of information
7638520	7641400	to improve the lived experience for all sentient beings.
7641400	7642840	That's literally what it is.
7642840	7644840	And I should say, this is not,
7644840	7647680	I'm definitely not the only person working on this.
7647680	7649720	There are many, many scientists throughout the world
7649720	7651280	who have the exact same issue
7651280	7653720	who are all working towards the same thing.
7653720	7656840	Various degrees of freedom of embodiment
7656840	7660280	and regenerative medicine and all of these kinds of things.
7660280	7664640	So this is not just, so I don't see it that I myself,
7664640	7666640	I'm going to sort of fix all these problems.
7666640	7669240	I'm speaking now for my view in the community
7670400	7675400	that we have a moral responsibility
7675440	7679960	and an absolute kind of imperative
7679960	7682800	to use this information to improve the state
7682800	7684520	of beings in this world now.
7684520	7689520	I do not believe we were sort of both physically in the world
7691840	7696200	and in terms of our IQ level,
7696200	7698280	our susceptibility to various weird diseases
7698280	7699800	to brain degeneration.
7699800	7701880	I do not believe that any of this is optimized.
7701880	7704200	Evolution did not optimize this for our happiness.
7704200	7705800	It did not optimize for intelligence.
7705800	7707880	Evolution optimizes for biomass.
7707880	7708720	That's it.
7708720	7711760	And so it happens to have dropped us at this level,
7711760	7714200	which is a little bit of IQ
7714200	7718120	and a little bit of survival over seven, eight decades tops.
7718120	7718960	And that's it.
7718960	7721960	And I don't see this as optimal in any way.
7721960	7726960	This is due to the vagaries of the evolutionary process
7726960	7729200	and it is now on us, now that we can,
7729200	7731520	to make improvements for everybody.
7731520	7732680	That's how I see this.
7733680	7734680	Thank you very much.
7734680	7736680	That's a terrific answer.
7736680	7737960	Thank you.
7737960	7742400	Tell you on me then, is absolutely crucial to your work.
7742400	7743240	Is that right?
7743240	7748240	The goal, the view that we are working,
7750600	7754720	we are goal-orientated is absolutely crucial then.
7755600	7756720	Absolutely.
7756720	7759040	And in two ways, let me say this about you.
7759040	7761480	So goal-directedness,
7761600	7764440	and I'm saying, never mind just us,
7764440	7766720	all the way down to you can even,
7766720	7768200	with least action, the kinds of things
7768200	7770800	you can even talk about particles and simple matter,
7770800	7773480	simple matter systems, all the way down.
7773480	7778480	And the reason, people who don't like any of it,
7778960	7781680	say don't use the word, people who really like teleology
7781680	7784280	say use teleology, don't say teleonomy.
7784280	7786440	Teleonomy was apparent to the goals, right?
7786440	7788320	And it's sort of this hedge that some people use
7788320	7792280	to sort of try to avoid being on the bad side
7792280	7794680	of the modern paradigm and so on.
7794680	7797160	The reason I actually like teleonomy
7797160	7799360	is not to go soft on the teleology angle.
7799360	7800800	I'm full in.
7800800	7802880	The reason what's interesting about teleonomy
7802880	7807200	is the fact of apparent means that you're acknowledging
7807200	7810480	that there is an observer from whose perspective
7810480	7811520	you're describing this.
7811520	7812600	And I think that's critical.
7812600	7814360	Most of, if we sort of drill down
7814360	7815800	into the philosophical underpinnings
7815800	7817640	of the things I've been talking about,
7817640	7820400	it is very critical that there is not one
7820400	7823200	objective right answer to all of this.
7823200	7824800	How intelligent is something?
7824800	7826840	Well, you're really taking an IQ test yourself
7826840	7828360	when you make that claim.
7828360	7829400	You might have a human brain
7829400	7831000	and you might think it makes a great paperweight
7831000	7832280	because you weren't smart enough to know
7832280	7833560	what else it knows how to do.
7833560	7836880	So all of this from the perspective of some observer
7836880	7840560	being that being another cell, a human scientist,
7840560	7844280	a conspecific, a parasite who seeks to hack the system
7844280	7847040	and engineer, everything is from somebody's perspective.
7847600	7849200	So that's why I like teleonomy,
7849200	7853560	but I'm 100% into the teleology angle.
7855040	7860040	So Gary's points earlier about non-locality
7862240	7866160	and the implicit idea that,
7867920	7871640	I don't know, could one end up with a Gaia hypothesis?
7871640	7873880	Does this relate to a Gaia hypothesis?
7874080	7876440	The whole of nature,
7879000	7882080	there is a purpose somewhere inherent
7882080	7883960	in the whole of nature.
7883960	7888960	Well, yes, although I wanna be really clear on this,
7889600	7890600	it is not simple.
7890600	7892200	I mean, those kind of hypotheses
7892200	7894360	are often criticized in the following way.
7895760	7899120	Well, you can just add those labels to anything.
7899120	7900360	You can sort of look outwards and say,
7900360	7903160	there's nature, I'm gonna call it Gaia and here we go.
7903880	7904720	So I'm not saying that,
7904720	7907040	what I'm saying is that actually,
7907040	7910880	I'm insisting that all of those kinds of things
7910880	7912960	are actually empirical hypotheses.
7912960	7915840	So that means that if you have the Gaia hypothesis,
7915840	7919040	what that should do for you is to be able to say
7919040	7923520	which tools can you use to benefit
7923520	7925680	from the agency you're hypothesizing.
7925680	7927600	So for example, if you think that
7928440	7933440	some sort of ecosystem is a higher level
7934760	7937640	protocognitive agent, you should be able to train it.
7937640	7940000	You should be able to find them and decode the memory.
7940000	7942440	You should be able to show some tools
7942440	7944800	from behavioral science that work at that level.
7944800	7946080	And to the extent that you can do that,
7946080	7948960	your hypothesis is validated, right?
7948960	7950720	All of this, and we do this all the time,
7950720	7953680	we apply these kinds of, to me, all of these claims,
7953680	7955480	what these claims really are,
7956320	7958400	protocols for engineering protocols.
7958400	7960080	So if somebody gives me something and says,
7960080	7962680	I tell you that the level of intelligence
7962680	7965040	in the system is X, what I hear is,
7965040	7966800	ah, so here are the things in my toolbox
7966800	7968160	that I can use to interact with it.
7968160	7969120	That's what you've told me.
7969120	7970520	And you might be right and you might be wrong,
7970520	7972400	or I might be more or less clever
7972400	7974360	and find some better way to interact with it.
7974360	7975880	But that's what I hear.
7975880	7978400	So the Gaia hypothesis maybe,
7978400	7981600	but it is a hypothesis that should be empirically tested
7981600	7982840	and somebody should come out and say,
7982840	7984760	look, I've done associative conditioning
7984760	7986440	on a whole ecosystem, and it works.
7986440	7988320	And we've done that on molecular networks, by the way.
7988320	7992480	We did that on molecular network models,
7992480	7995240	which look very deterministic and very simple and all that.
7995240	7997080	Turns out they can do six different kinds of learning.
7997080	7997920	Who knew?
7997920	8000360	Nobody would have known until you do the experiment.
8001960	8004200	And Gaia, shut up, and thank you very much
8004200	8006920	because I'm sure lots of other people have got questions.
8006920	8008320	Thank you so much.
8008320	8009400	Thank you, Richard.
8010360	8012520	So yeah, so unfortunately we are towards the,
8012520	8015400	we're getting, we've gone quite a bit over.
8015400	8018040	However, if after we finish the call,
8018040	8019520	I can always leave the room open.
8019520	8021240	If, Michael, you're happy to stay
8021240	8024640	and answer any questions that there may be.
8024640	8025480	Sure, I'll stay.
8025480	8028000	Yeah, I'll stay for another 15 minutes.
8028000	8030120	I've got till 2.30, so I can, yeah.
8030120	8031280	I'll stay for another 15.
8031280	8032120	Fantastic.
8032120	8034680	Well, just for the purposes of the session,
8034680	8036240	we should close.
8036240	8040760	But Michael, do you have any final words to leave us with?
8041760	8043640	No, I think I've said,
8043640	8045920	I've drawn on a lot long enough.
8045920	8047320	So thank you, everybody.
8047320	8049440	Great questions, great discussion.
8049440	8051080	I really appreciate your listening.
8051080	8051920	No, thank you.
8051920	8053760	Well, thank you so much, Michael.
8053760	8056440	Your work has been, as I said, outstanding.
8056440	8059560	So I hope we show all the best of luck with your research.
8059560	8060520	And that...
8060520	8061280	Thank you so much.
8061280	8062120	Yeah.
8062120	8062960	Thank you.
8062960	8065680	And yeah, of course, thank everyone who joined us today.
8065680	8068240	Before we go, just a quick reminder that tomorrow
8068240	8070080	we will have Dr. Julian Mossbridge
8070080	8073120	talking about human thinking and human being
8073120	8075800	as part of this series.
8075800	8077760	But until tomorrow, if you do have any questions,
8077760	8083240	feel free to drop us an email at elinoratbarcenter.com.
8083240	8084360	And thank you again, everyone.
8084360	8085280	Thank you, Michael.
8085280	8087640	As I said, I will leave the call open.
8087640	8090200	I'll pass it over to you, Michael, as a host
8090200	8092200	to carry on for whoever would like to.
8092200	8096600	But thank you again, everyone, from here at the Bar Centre.
8096600	8097440	Thank you.
8100720	8103280	Yeah, so I think we can...
8103280	8105920	Yeah, everyone would like to jump in.
8105920	8108080	Yeah, that's fine.
8108080	8112520	Michael, thank you for that stunning presentation.
8112520	8115680	It's a very general question I'd like to ask.
8115680	8118640	And it's really to do with evolution.
8118640	8123760	I'm aware of many very credible scientists
8123760	8127680	who believe that there are other mechanisms involved
8127680	8132360	in evolution, some form of intelligence
8132360	8137200	or maybe a mechanism that results in good choices being made.
8137200	8140600	I can think of one quantum physicist that actually says
8140600	8143120	that, well, consciousness chooses.
8143120	8146840	Given the astonishing things you've discovered,
8146840	8151360	what is your intuition about evolution
8151360	8154800	and whether or not it could possibly be or it is
8154800	8158840	random mutations giving some kind of advantage?
8159840	8161680	Yeah, well, a couple of things.
8161680	8166360	First, the very best person to talk about this with
8166360	8169320	is a guy named Richard Watson in the UK.
8169320	8173000	And he has what I think is hands down
8173000	8177160	the biggest advance in evolutionary thinking.
8177160	8178360	And I don't know how long.
8178360	8182000	So you guys might want to invite him to speak.
8182040	8185080	But here's what I do know.
8187280	8192280	Given the various things we've observed our systems doing,
8194360	8196600	it would not be very hard to build
8196600	8201600	a synthetic biology system in which edited its genome
8203160	8206000	with some degree of conscious intent.
8206000	8207760	Okay, that would not be difficult.
8207760	8212240	Therefore, given that I sort of go with this idea
8212240	8214720	that whatever is not physically impossible
8214720	8217200	is probably doable somewhere,
8217200	8220000	I would find it not surprising at all
8220000	8220960	that that would be the case
8220960	8222880	because I can certainly see how we would construct
8222880	8223720	such a thing.
8224720	8227920	However, what I don't have is a lot of evidence
8227920	8229600	that that in fact is what's happening.
8229600	8234080	So my gut feeling is if I had to say gut feeling,
8234080	8237640	I do not believe that the standard purely random account
8237640	8241360	of evolution is sufficient to explain what we see.
8241360	8245720	But I'm not sure there's superb evidence
8245720	8248360	to sort of rule it out.
8248360	8252080	And I want to be very clear in distinguishing
8252080	8254440	because people tend to jump from one to the other.
8254440	8258880	One thing is saying that there is a non-random influence
8258880	8260480	over the process, right?
8260480	8262120	And I think that's not surprise.
8262120	8263880	I wouldn't be surprised by that at all.
8263880	8265800	It's quite something else to say
8265800	8268240	there is a high level benevolent intelligence
8268240	8269960	guiding the process tour, right?
8269960	8271640	That's a whole other kettle of fish, right?
8271640	8274400	And I have zero reason to think that's the case.
8274400	8279400	So some level of control mechanism that isn't randomness,
8279560	8282360	I'm probably on board with that, but that's it.
8282360	8284800	I wouldn't, I don't think we can, I mean, it's not impossible
8284800	8287480	but I don't think we can jump from that to anything else.
8287480	8290040	So that's, you know, just want to say that.
8290040	8291400	Great, thank you.
8291400	8293120	That's very clear, thank you.
8293120	8293960	Thank you.
8296800	8297800	Okay, just.
8301800	8302640	Who else?
8302640	8306800	I think Niels and Vyans had a hand up.
8310800	8312280	Yeah, please, somebody go.
8312280	8314400	Does Neil want to go in or I'd be glad to.
8314400	8315960	I have sort of a non-sense.
8315960	8316800	Ladies first.
8319320	8320680	Okay, thanks.
8320680	8322480	Listen, I just wanted to know something about
8322480	8325280	from one of the very first slides you presented
8325280	8329000	of a cell gravitating towards the three petri dishes.
8329000	8334000	If there had been a nutrient in the upper petri dish,
8334040	8336640	would that migrated up there
8336640	8339720	or would it still go on towards the weightier?
8339720	8341360	Yeah, great, great question.
8341360	8344720	We have started but not finished a book,
8344720	8349360	not a book, probably a paper on the psychology of slime mold.
8349360	8351960	And all of these kinds of questions
8351960	8353560	in terms of what does it prefer?
8353560	8354960	How does it make decisions?
8354960	8358080	When two things are, you know, sort of great question.
8358080	8360440	It depends on the nutrient and it depends, I mean,
8360440	8363040	nutrient, if it's hungry, nutrients tend to win.
8363040	8364800	So if it's hungry, it will go for the food
8364800	8366360	and ignore the mass.
8366360	8368040	By the way, those little, I should say,
8368040	8370080	those little white discs, they're not petri dishes,
8370080	8372160	they're little tiny glass discs.
8372160	8374120	Right through a glass, tiny glass.
8374120	8377400	Each one of which weighs about 10 milligrams.
8377400	8380840	So this thing can sense at a distance of 10 centimeters,
8380840	8383760	the difference between 10 milligrams and 30 milligrams.
8383760	8385560	It is ridiculously sensitive.
8385560	8388160	But nutrients, nutrients will tend to win.
8388160	8391720	Yeah, it's just been the most amazing presentation.
8391720	8392560	Thank you.
8392560	8393400	Thank you so much.
8393400	8394240	Thank you.
8394240	8395080	Yeah.
8395080	8395920	Niels.
8397400	8402400	Yes, amazing, a lot of stuff and little bits floating
8404640	8407760	around here and there and all over the place.
8408760	8411000	That was very interesting.
8411880	8416880	In my case, I've been a computer chap for over 50 years
8421880	8426320	and I've managed to do what I now can see
8426320	8428080	quite remarkable things.
8428080	8433080	And so I spent some time trying to keep up with you
8433920	8437800	because I immediately started thinking about all the things
8437800	8442080	that I could implant into this.
8442080	8445920	And so it's really,
8448920	8453520	you've heard about P equal NP complete, I'm sure.
8453520	8454360	Yeah.
8455360	8458560	What difference would that make, do you think?
8459560	8464560	To find, because that would basically be able to hold
8465920	8470920	everything together in all its complexity.
8471600	8475600	And so I have some experience with that for
8476560	8480560	in terms of transportation modeling and pedestrian
8480560	8483560	and all these interactions and things.
8483560	8487560	So I was thinking, I'm not sure if I'm going to be able
8487560	8492560	to get involved in there and try and simulate it
8492560	8497560	in a deterministic way, not in a stochastic way.
8499560	8501560	Yeah, drop me an email.
8501560	8504560	I mean, this is, we do about a third of my group.
8504560	8506560	My background is computer science as well.
8506560	8511560	And about a third of my group is computational
8511560	8513560	and the others are bench biologists.
8513560	8516560	So we do a ton of modeling and simulation of this stuff.
8517560	8519560	So just drop me an email and we could talk
8519560	8521560	about what can be done.
8521560	8523560	Yes, I would love to do that.
8523560	8524560	Great, great.
8524560	8525560	Yeah.
8525560	8526560	Okay, thank you.
8526560	8527560	It was a great talk.
8527560	8528560	Thank you so much.
8528560	8530560	Lots of information in that.
8530560	8531560	Thank you.
8531560	8532560	Thank you.
8533560	8534560	Phillip.
8535560	8536560	Hello.
8536560	8537560	Hi.
8537560	8541560	I'd like to take you back to the body of the planaria worm.
8541560	8543560	And we're talking about the heads and the two heads.
8543560	8547560	And in order for the body to form,
8547560	8551560	apparently there's a bioelectric distribution that.
8553560	8555560	Allows us to happen.
8555560	8558560	And I'm wondering what you think of the source of that distribution
8558560	8561560	within the biomass of the body is.
8561560	8563560	Yeah.
8563560	8566560	Are you asking physically which cells it's in?
8566560	8568560	Are you asking where it came from?
8568560	8570560	I'm asking where it came from.
8570560	8571560	Right.
8571560	8574560	Well, that's, that's a great, that's a great question.
8574560	8577560	So let's, um, the, the best way to think about,
8577560	8578560	and we're still,
8578560	8580560	we're still groping for the right metaphors to understand it,
8580560	8583560	but let's, let me, let me give you what, what I have so far.
8583560	8584560	Um,
8584560	8588560	The thing with asking where things came from is, is this, and I think,
8588560	8590560	you know, maybe, maybe some of the, um,
8590560	8593560	non science people on the call will like this more than,
8593560	8595560	more than the science people, but, but, but here you go.
8595560	8597560	Um, imagine a, um,
8597560	8599560	um, uh, imagine a Galton board.
8599560	8602560	If you haven't seen one of these things, you can buy a toy of it on Amazon.
8602560	8603560	It's 15 bucks.
8603560	8606560	It's a wooden board like this and you bang a bunch of nails into it vertically,
8606560	8609560	you know, vertically, and you take a bucket and you take a bucket of marbles
8609560	8611560	and you dump it over and the marbles go boom, boom, boom, boom, boom,
8611560	8612560	and they land on the bottom.
8612560	8615560	They always land in the same pattern, this beautiful bell curve, right?
8615560	8617560	They always make this beautiful bell curve.
8617560	8620560	So you can ask this question of, um,
8620560	8622560	where's the bell curve encoded?
8622560	8625560	So you look at the wood and you don't really see it there and you look at the nails.
8625560	8628560	You don't really see it there and you look at the distribution of nails and
8628560	8629560	I really see it there.
8629560	8633560	What you find out, and this is, you know, uh, uh, mathematicians,
8633560	8636560	like, like, uh, Pythagoras and Plato have been saying this for, for,
8636560	8637560	for a long time.
8637560	8640560	What you find out is that when you build certain kinds of machines,
8640560	8644560	you are actually harnessing patterns that exist.
8644560	8648560	I don't know where, you know, Plato thought there was a separate world for them,
8648560	8652560	but, but, but this is, you know, so, so for example, when you make a couple of
8652560	8655560	transistors, meaning ion channels, when you, ion channels are transistors,
8655560	8657560	they're voltage gated current conductances.
8657560	8660560	When, when evolution discovers a couple of ion channels,
8660560	8663560	it can make logic gates which come with truth tables.
8663560	8665560	Evolution doesn't have to discover truth tables there.
8665560	8666560	You get that for free, right?
8666560	8669560	And the fact that the NAND gate is, you know, uh,
8669560	8672560	it has these special properties, you get that, you get all of that for free.
8672560	8673560	It's a free gift from somewhere.
8673560	8674560	We don't know where it is.
8674560	8677560	So what we have here is something similar.
8677560	8682560	What evolution did is find a set of ion channels that are expressed
8682560	8686560	in a standard planarian that by default, when you turn on the juice,
8686560	8692560	what that system does is stable is, is, is, is find and stabilize in an
8692560	8696560	attractor in the state space of the, of the electrical circuit that corresponds
8696560	8697560	to one head.
8697560	8700560	By default, still, you know, reliably, that's what it does.
8700560	8704560	When you, when we, when we've learned to perturb it, which took, you know,
8704560	8708560	10 years to learn to do that, you can push it into a different state and
8708560	8709560	it'll do that.
8709560	8711560	But the question is where did it come from?
8711560	8714560	It's sort of like asking, uh, you know,
8714560	8717560	if I give you a collection of parts for a calculator and you turn it on,
8717560	8721560	and it says zero by default on a little LCD, where did that come from?
8721560	8726560	And it's, it's the result of the laws of physics of computation and some
8726560	8729560	other stuff working out through the physical machine.
8729560	8733560	And this, all this sounds very airy, fairy and, and sort of, um, uh,
8733560	8735560	philosophical, but, but, but here's a practical part.
8735560	8740560	Imagine that your evolution and you, in your world, the most fit thing is a
8740560	8742560	triangle of a particular type.
8742560	8745560	So, so, so you're sorting through this population and eventually you find the
8745560	8749560	first angle and then you do some more, you know, every generations go by and
8749560	8751560	you eventually find the second angle.
8751560	8752560	And now you're done.
8752560	8754560	You don't need to go looking for the third angle.
8754560	8756560	You know what the third angle is because, because they add up to 180.
8756560	8758560	How did you, how did you, if your evolution,
8758560	8762560	how did you save two thirds of the effort in, in evolving this thing?
8762560	8765560	Where did this magical fact that you know what the third angle is?
8765560	8766560	Where did that come from?
8766560	8771560	So, so we get here to the point where, um, asking where things come from is tricky.
8771560	8777560	We can, we can do the biophysics of that, of, of showing what the space looks
8777560	8782560	like and why the system lands in particular regions of that space.
8783560	8787560	But it's not super easy to figure out, to ask, it's like, where's the
8787560	8788560	distribution of primes come?
8788560	8789560	Where's that encoded?
8789560	8792560	You know, all the physical facts of the, of the universe could be different
8792560	8794560	and the distribution of primes would still be what it is.
8794560	8799560	So I think we're, we're literally bumping up against that old question of
8799560	8803560	where the truths of mathematics live.
8803560	8805560	Okay, I'll just say one final thing.
8805560	8806560	Thank you for the answer.
8806560	8814560	But what perplexes me very much is how the two headed version comes to be so
8814560	8821560	quickly, you know, another, another stable configuration emerges.
8821560	8826560	It's, it's, it's very perplexing to me that I agree that it's perplexing.
8826560	8830560	And, and I think the, you know, when I first started to understand the,
8830560	8834560	when I first saw that Xenobot running around and it suddenly like hit me
8834560	8838560	in the head, there's never been any Xenobots like evolution has zero
8838560	8840560	explanatory power here.
8840560	8846560	I, I, it suddenly dawned on me that what, what, what, what Plato would say to
8846560	8851560	this is that the two headed planarian and the Xenobot have always been there.
8851560	8855560	They're part of this latent space that we had never had access to.
8855560	8859560	And we finally built a physical machine that enables us to see that part of
8859560	8860560	the space.
8860560	8861560	I think that's what that's what he would say.
8861560	8866560	I think that something existed in the past that laid down a certain behavior
8866560	8868560	pattern that they're tuning into.
8868560	8870560	I don't, I don't think they're creating those patterns.
8870560	8874560	I think they're finding patterns that already existed.
8874560	8877560	Yeah, I mean, I said, I, right, I think you and I are on the same page here.
8877560	8882560	The patterns exist, but I think we have to be, you know, the traditional,
8882560	8888560	the traditional scientific story here would be they, they are patterns that,
8888560	8892560	you know, typically in a normal tree of life, what you see is these are patterns
8892560	8898560	that either existed in some ancestor and were shaped by evolution to be.
8898560	8900560	That's not the case here.
8900560	8904560	But I agree with you, the patterns exist independently of what we've done.
8904560	8907560	We've just stumbled onto them for the first time and who knows what else is out
8907560	8908560	there.
8908560	8909560	Okay, very good.
8909560	8912560	Thank you.
8912560	8913560	Thank you.
8913560	8914560	Thank you.
8914560	8915560	Thank you.
8915560	8916560	Thank you.
8916560	8917560	Thank you.
8917560	8918560	Thank you.
8918560	8919560	Thank you.
8919560	8922560	Thank you for burning things. I'm going to have to go in about a minute.
8922560	8923560	All right.
8923560	8926560	Well, thank you so much, everybody. This has been, this has been really fun.
8926560	8927560	Yes.
8927560	8928560	Yeah.
8928560	8931560	Lots of, lots of great things for me to think about. So, so thank you so much.
