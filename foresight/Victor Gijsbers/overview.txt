Checking Victor Gijsbers/Willard V. O. Quine - Two Dogmas of Empiricism.txt
1. **Historical Context**: "Two Dogmas" is a seminal paper by W.V.O. Quine that had a profound impact on 20th-century philosophy, particularly in the analytic tradition. It challenges certain philosophical assumptions and methods, advocating for an empiricist approach that rejects the distinction between analytic and synthetic statements.

2. **Quine's Empiricism**: Quine argues for a form of empiricism that is skeptical of the reliability of sense data and the possibility of knowing anything beyond observable phenomena. He emphasizes the indeterminacy of translation and the underdetermination of theory by data, suggesting that our knowledge is always open to revision in light of new sensory stimulation.

3. **Critique of Analytic/Synthetic Distinction**: Quine aims to show that the analytic-synthetic distinction—a key Kantian and logical positivist concept that differentiates between truths of logic, mathematics, and analytic propositions (true by definition) and empirical or synthetic propositions (true by how the world is)—is untenable. He does this by questioning the notion of meaning and the idea that there are necessary truths that are independent of empirical content.

4. **"Gavagai" Argument**: Quine famously questions whether the term "gavagai" refers to all and only geese in a particular example, undermining the idea that language corresponds neatly to categories in the world. This leads to the conclusion that the meaning of words is not fixed but is constantly being revised as we receive new sensory stimulation.

5. **Pragmatic Maxim**: Quine introduces the pragmatic maxim, which holds that the aim of science is to minimize the total error in predictions about observable phenomena. This maxim guides our choice of scientific theories and also applies to the philosophical frameworks we adopt.

6. **Web of Belief**: Quine's metaphor of the "web of belief" suggests that our beliefs are interconnected and can be revised as a whole in response to new experiences. However, this metaphor raises questions about how experience informs belief and what standards govern the coherence of the web.

7. **Critical Evaluation**: While "Two Dogmas" has been highly influential, it is not without its critics. Some argue that Quine's views presuppose a certain philosophical stance and do not necessarily invalidate the analytic-synthetic distinction for those who accept different premises. Additionally, his web metaphor itself raises questions about the nature of coherence and the role of logic within it.

8. **Conclusion**: "Two Dogmas" is a complex and influential paper that has shaped contemporary philosophy. It challenges the analytic-synthetic distinction and promotes an empiricist, naturalized approach to both science and philosophy. While it may not definitively defeat the distinction, it has certainly altered how philosophers think about language, meaning, and scientific knowledge.
