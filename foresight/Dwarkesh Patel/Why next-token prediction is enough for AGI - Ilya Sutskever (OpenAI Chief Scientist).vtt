00:00.000 --> 00:03.040
I challenge the claim that next token prediction cannot

00:03.040 --> 00:08.560
surpass human performance. It looks like on the surface, it

00:08.560 --> 00:11.920
cannot. It looks on the surface, if you just learn to

00:11.920 --> 00:16.320
imitate, to predict what people do, it means that you can only

00:16.320 --> 00:20.240
copy people. But there here is a counter argument for why it

00:20.240 --> 00:24.240
might not be quite so if your neural net is, if your base

00:24.240 --> 00:27.520
neural net is smart enough, you just ask it like, what would

00:27.600 --> 00:31.200
what would a person with like great insight and wisdom and

00:31.200 --> 00:35.200
capability do? Maybe such a person doesn't exist. But there's

00:35.200 --> 00:37.520
a pretty good chance that the neural net will be able to

00:37.600 --> 00:41.840
extrapolate how such a person would behave. Do you see what I

00:41.840 --> 00:42.160
mean?

00:42.320 --> 00:44.640
Yes, although where would it get the sort of insight about

00:44.640 --> 00:48.240
what that's a person would do, if not from from the data of

00:48.240 --> 00:50.240
regular people? Because like, if you think about it, what does

00:50.240 --> 00:54.160
it mean to predict the next token well enough? What does it

00:54.160 --> 00:56.160
mean? Actually, it's actually it's a much it's a deeper

00:56.160 --> 00:59.280
question than it seems. Predicting the next token well

00:59.280 --> 01:07.120
means that you understand the underlying reality that led to

01:07.120 --> 01:11.840
the creation of that token. It's not statistics like it is

01:11.840 --> 01:16.080
statistics, but what is statistics? In order to on to

01:16.080 --> 01:18.720
understand those statistics to compress them, you need to

01:18.720 --> 01:23.200
understand what is it about the world that creates this those

01:23.200 --> 01:26.080
statistics. And so then you say, Okay, well, I have all those

01:26.080 --> 01:28.640
people. What is it about people that creates their behaviors?

01:28.720 --> 01:31.520
Well, they have, you know, they have thoughts and they have

01:31.520 --> 01:34.080
feelings and they have ideas and they do things in certain

01:34.080 --> 01:38.720
ways. All of those would be deduced from next token

01:38.720 --> 01:43.360
prediction. And I'd argue that this should make it possible,

01:43.440 --> 01:47.200
not indefinitely, but to a to a pretty decent degree to say

01:47.200 --> 01:50.080
well, can you guess what you what you do if you took a person

01:50.080 --> 01:52.800
with like this characteristic and that characteristic, like

01:52.800 --> 01:56.560
such a person doesn't exist. But because you're so good at

01:56.560 --> 01:58.720
predicting the next token, you should still be able to guess

01:58.720 --> 02:03.280
what that person would do this hypothetical imaginary person

02:03.280 --> 02:08.960
means far greater mental ability than the rest of us.
