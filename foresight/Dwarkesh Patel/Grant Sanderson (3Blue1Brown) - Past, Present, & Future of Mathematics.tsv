0	4080	The videos were really inspiring like you're the reason I'm like going into grad school
4080	8600	And there's this little bell in the back of my mind. It's like do I want that?
9600	14080	To get more people going into math PhDs math Academy of Finance and
14800	18360	Computer science almost certainly have an overallocation of talent
18360	25040	I actually I'm quite determined at some point to like be a high school math teacher for some number of years math lends itself to
25600	28280	Synthetic data how AlphaGo is trained you could have it
28760	34800	Produce a lot of proofs and just train on a whole bunch of those and the thing that takes at most 30 minutes of the teacher's time
34800	37080	maybe even 30 seconds has these
37800	43360	Completely monumental rippling effects for the life of the student they were talking to that then sets them on this whole different trajectory
44520	50680	Okay today, I have the pleasure of interviewing Grant Sanderson of the YouTube channel through blue one brown
50760	57440	You all know who grant is I'm really excited about this one by the time that an AI model can get gold in the
57560	65080	International Math Olympiad is that just a GI given the amount of creative problem solving and chain of thought required to do that I
66160	69520	To be honest have no idea what people mean when they use the word a GI
69520	72520	Yeah, I think if you ask ten different people like what they mean by it
72520	78160	You're gonna get ten slightly different answers and it seems like what people want to get it is a
78480	85080	Discrete change that I don't think actually exists. We've got okay AI is up to a certain point. They're not a GI
85080	87080	They might be really smart, but it's not a GI
87440	91680	And then after some point that's the benchmark when like now there now. It's generally intelligent
92240	95880	The reason that world model doesn't really fit is it feels a lot more continuous where
97320	102040	You know gpd4 feels general in the sense that you have one training algorithm
102160	108000	That applies to a very very large set of different kinds of tasks that someone might want to be able to do and that's cool
108000	114760	That's like an invention that people in the 60s might not have expected to be true for the nature of how artificial intelligence can be
115040	122240	Programmed so it's it's generally intelligent, but maybe what people mean by oh, it's not a GI is you've got certain benchmarks where
122240	126000	You know, it's better than most people at some things, but it's not better at most people than others
126240	128400	You know at this point, it's better than most people at math
128880	135000	You know it's better than most people at solving AMC problems and like Imo problems is just not better than the best
135000	138520	And so maybe at the point when it's getting golds in the Imo
139040	143840	That's a sign that okay. It's it's as good as the best and we've ticked off another domain
143960	145280	but
145280	151760	I don't know like it is what you mean by a GI that you've you've enumerated all the possible domains that something could be good at
151760	156200	And now it's better than humans at all of them or enough that it could take over
156840	158680	substantial fractions of
158680	163520	You know human jobs or something where right now it's it's it's impressive
163520	168080	But it's not gonna be even 1% of GDP, but in my mind if it's getting gold in Imo
168080	171120	I mean having seen some of those problems from your channel
171120	173240	I'm I'm thinking wow, that's that's really coming after our
173800	176160	Podcasters and video animators. I don't know
176160	181120	I don't know that feels orthogonal because getting a gold in the Imo feels a lot more like being really really good at
181120	185320	Go or chess like those those feel analogous. Well, it's it's super creative
185320	188920	Like I think anyone I don't I don't know chess as well as the people are into it
188920	194800	But everything that I hear from them the sort of moves that are made and choices have all of the air of creativity
195000	199120	I think as soon as they started generating artwork than everyone else could appreciate
199120	204640	Oh, there's there's something that deserves to be called creative here and the creative side of the math
204640	209960	You know, I'm I don't know how it would look when people get them to be getting golds at the Imo
209960	211320	but I imagine
211320	216680	It's something that looks a little bit like how alpha go is trained where you have it like play with itself a whole bunch
216680	218840	You know math lends itself to
219400	223040	Synthetic data in the ways that a lot of other domains don't you could have it
223560	229080	Produce a lot of proofs in a proof-checking language like lean for example and just train on a whole bunch of those and like is this
229080	232360	A valid proof is this not a valid proof and then counterbalance that with
232800	239560	English written versions of something and so I imagine what it looks like once you get something that is solving these Imo level things
240080	243760	One of one of two things either it writes a very good proof
244240	250240	That you feel like is unmotivated because anyone who reads math papers has this feeling that there are there two types
250240	256040	There's the ones where you morally understand why the result should be true and then there's the ones where you like I can follow the steps
256440	258040	Why would you have come up with that?
258040	262960	I don't know but I guess that shows that the result is true and you you're left wanting something a little bit more
262960	267160	And so you could imagine if it produces that on the gold to get a gold in the Imo
267160	272160	Is that the same kind of ability as what is required to replace jobs?
272760	280200	Just like not really like the the impediments between where it is now and replacing jobs feels like a whole different set of things like
280440	287560	Having a context window that is a longer than you know some small things such that you can make connections over long periods of time and build
287720	292640	Relationships and understand where someone's coming from and the actual problem-solving part of it
292640	295960	I mean, it's a sign that it would be a more helpful tool
295960	300840	But in the same way that like Mathematica can help you solve math problems much more effectively
301240	306960	Tell me why I should be less amazed by it or maybe put in a different context for the reason I would be very impressed is
307280	313000	That with chess or something obviously this is not all the chess programs are doing
313000	318240	but there's a level of research you can do to narrow down the possibilities and more importantly
318640	323920	The in the math example, it seems that with some of the examples you've elicited on your channel
323920	329680	For example, the ability to solve the problem is so dependent on coming up with the right
330080	332080	abstraction to think about it coming up with
333040	340120	Ways of thinking all the problems that are not evident in the problem itself or in any other problem in any other test that seems different from
341240	343040	Just a chess game where you don't have to like
343040	348520	Well, what is the largest structure of this chess game in the same way as you do with the IML problem?
348520	354840	I think you should ask people who know a lot about go and chess and I'd be curious to hear their opinions on it because I
355280	361040	Imagine what they would say is if you're gonna be as good at go as Alpha go is you're also not doing tree search
361080	365640	At least exclusively it's not dependent on something as both in that because you get this combinatorial
366080	369600	Explosion, which is why people thought that game would be so much harder for so much longer
369800	376040	There sort of has to be something like a higher level structure in their understanding and then don't get me wrong
376040	380400	I would be super impressed and like anticipate being very impressed when you get
380640	385320	AI's that can solve these IMO problems because you're absolutely right
385320	388640	There's a level of creativity involved. The only claim I'm making is that
389280	395960	Being able to do that feels distinct from the impediments between I don't know where we are now and the
396440	398560	AI's take over all of our jobs or something
398560	401640	It just it seems like it's gonna be another one of those boxes
401640	410000	That's it's this historic moment analogous to chess and go more so than it's good to be analogous to the industrial revolution
410560	413440	I'm surprised you wouldn't be more compelled
414440	417440	Compilled right or just you don't think that skill of
418440	422880	This problem is isomorphic to this completely different way of thinking about what's happening in the situation
422880	427400	And here's me going through the 50 steps to put all that together into this one proof
427400	432040	I'm surprised don't think that's upstream of a lot of valuable tasks
432040	436840	I think it's a similar level of how impressed I was with
437320	441960	the stable diffusion type stuff where you know you ask it give me a
442640	449240	Landscape of beautiful mountains, but made out of like quartz and gemstones or something and it gives you this thing which
449640	454340	Has all of the essence of a landscape, but it's not literally a landscape and so you realize okay
454340	458460	There's something something beyond the literal that's understood here
458460	462560	I'm like that's very impressive and in the same way to solve one of these math problems that requires creativity
462560	465240	You can't just go from the definitions. You're 100% right
465240	469480	you need this element of lateral thinking which is why we find so much joy in
470160	473600	Finding the solutions ourselves or even just seeing other people get those solutions
473720	480480	It's exactly the kind of joy that you get out of good artistic analogies and comparisons and mixing and matching
480480	485040	I'm very impressed by all of that. It's just I think it's in the same category and it's
485520	491600	Maybe I don't have the same opinions as a lot of other people with this hard line between there's pre-AGI and post-AGI
491720	494200	Like I just don't know what they mean by the word AGI
494240	501160	And I don't think that you're gonna have something that's this measurable discrete step much less that a math tournament is gonna be
501160	505040	An example of what that discrete step would look like interesting interesting
505600	511200	Okay applied mathematicians, okay, where do we put them in society where they can have the biggest benefit?
511200	513720	we like a lot of them go into computer science and IT and
514880	516560	I'm sure there's been lots of benefits there
516560	521880	But we're you know where are there are parts of society where you just have a whole bunch of mathematicians go in and they can make
521880	526480	Things a lot better, you know, I don't know transportation or logistics or manufacturing
526480	529960	But where else do you think they might be useful? That's such a good question in some ways?
529960	531960	I'm like the worst person to ask about that
532320	533960	This isn't gonna answer your question
533960	537320	But instead is gonna like fan the flames of why I feel it's an important question
537320	542080	I have actually been thinking recently about if it's worth making an out-of-typical video
542440	548120	That's specifically addressed it like and inspiring people to ask that especially students who are graduating because I think
548520	554680	This thing happens where when you fall in love with math or some sort of technical field by default in school
554680	557320	You you study that and when you're studying that
558200	559160	effectively
559160	563600	You're going through an apprenticeship to be an expert in that or a researcher in that
563600	568960	You know the structure of studying physics in a university or math in a university even though they know that not all majors are gonna go
568960	570040	Into the field
570040	574920	The people that you're gaining mentorship from are academics and our research is in the field
574920	577200	So it's hard not to effectively be apprenticing in that
577800	583040	And I also have noticed that when I go and give talks at universities or things like this and
583680	587080	Students come up after and they're like saying hi. There's a lot of them like grand
587560	591600	The videos were really inspiring like you're the reason that I studied math or that you're the reason
591600	596440	I'm like going into grad school and there's this little bell in the back of my mind. That's like cool cool
596440	600280	I'm amazed. I don't know if I believe I was wholly responsible for it, but like cool to have that impact
600880	602880	Do I want that?
603160	608280	Is this a good thing to get more people going into math PhDs on the one hand
608280	612480	I unequivocally want more people to self-identify as liking math. That's very good
612480	618500	But that those who are doing that necessarily get shuffled into the traditional outlets like math academia
619000	622280	Yeah, I think you highlighted very right. It's like math academia finance and
623000	625500	Computer science data science something in there in general
626000	631760	Are very common things to go to and as a result they almost certainly have an overallocation of talent
632240	634000	All three of those are valuable, right?
634000	636320	I'm not saying like those are not valuable things to go into
636560	642000	But if you were playing God and like shifting around where do you want people to go again?
642080	643720	I'm not answering your question
643720	646200	I'm just asking it in other words because I don't really know
646200	650920	I think you should probably talk to the people who made that shift of which there aren't a huge number
650920	653920	But like Eric Lander is maybe one good example
655400	661160	Jim Simons would maybe be another whereas people who were doing a very purely academic thing
661160	663480	And then decided to shift to something very different
664280	668200	now I have sort of had this thought that it's very beneficial to
668800	674600	Insert some forcing function that gets the pure mathematicians to spend some of their time in a non-pure math setting
674600	675360	you know
675360	677360	NSF grants coming with a a
677880	683120	Requirement that 10% of your time goes towards a collaboration with another department or something like that
683480	690440	The thought being these are really good problem solvers and a specific category of problems and to just distribute that talent elsewhere
690440	696040	Might be helpful and when I when I like run this by mathematicians. Sometimes there's a mixed response for the like
697040	700320	I don't know if we'd be all that useful like there's a sense that the
700680	708160	Aesthetic of what constitutes a good math problem is by its nature rooted in the purity of it such that it's maybe a little
708440	714120	Elitist to assume that just because people are really really good at solving that kind of problem that somehow their
714640	717480	Abilities are more generalizable than other people's abilities
717480	723160	You know why ask about the applied mathematicians rather than saying like shouldn't the applied biologists go and work in
723440	729360	Logistics and things like that because they also have a set of problem-solving abilities. That's maybe generalizable the back of my mind
729360	731360	I think no, but the mathematicians are
731600	733600	Really is something general about math
734560	736560	so I
736720	737880	Don't have the answers
737880	744120	I will say I'm actually very curious to hear from people for what they think the right answers are or from people who made that switch
744120	747800	Let's say they were a math major or or something adjacent like computer science physics
747800	751880	And then they decided that they wanted to pour themselves into something not because
752280	758360	That was the academic itch that scratched that they were scratching by being good at school and getting to appreciate that
758360	761400	But because they stepped back and said what impact do I want to make on the world?
762520	766920	I'm hungry for more of those stories because I think it could be very compelling to
767480	771880	convey those specifically to my audience who is probably
772760	778840	On track to go into just the traditional math type fields and maybe there's room to have a little bit of influence to disperse them more
779000	783360	Effectively, but I don't know. I don't know what more effectively looks like because at the end of the day
783360	786640	I'm like I'm a math youtuber, right? I'm not someone who
787480	794280	Has a career in logistics or manufacturing or all of these things in such a way that I can have an in-tune feel for where is there a
795520	799440	need for this specific kind of abstract problem-solving it might be useful to
800320	801920	speculate on how
801920	807040	An undergrad or somebody who's a young math whiz might even begin to contemplate
807360	813040	Here's where I can have an edge. I'm remembering actually it just occurred to me a former podcast guest Lars Dusset
813560	816760	he was a game designer actually and he
817960	822080	Started learning about Georgism, which is this idea that you should tax land and only land
822080	826040	And so he got really interested in not only writing about those ideas
826040	831200	But also with well if you're gonna tax land you had to figure out what the value of land is
831200	832560	I mean, how do you figure out the value of land?
832560	839440	There's all these algorithms of how you do this optimally based on neighboring land and how to average across land and
839560	841560	There's a lot of intricacies there
841560	848000	And so he he now has a start-up where he just contracts with cities to implement these
848280	852280	Algorithms to help them assess the value of their land which makes property taxes much more feasible
852520	855880	You know just that's another example right where the motivation was more philosophical
855880	859040	But his specialty as a technical person helped them
859600	862520	You know how to make a contribution there. I think that's perfect
862680	867840	Probably the true answer is that you're not gonna give a universal thing for any individual
867840	873840	It's gonna be based on where their life circumstances connect them into something either because they he had an interest in
873840	877080	Georgism for whatever reason, but if someone I don't know their
877240	883520	Their dad runs a paper mill and they're like connected to the family business in that way and realize they can like plug themselves in a little bit
883520	888040	More efficiently you you're gonna have this wide diversity of the ways that people are applying themselves
888360	892960	That does not take the form of general advice given from some podcast somewhere
892960	899600	But instead takes the form of simply inviting people to like think critically about the question rather than following the momentum of
899800	902600	What being good at school implies about your future?
903080	904960	We were talking about this before the interview started
904960	912200	but we have a much better grasp on reality based on our mathematical tools and I'm not talking about anything advanced literally just it will
912200	913960	being able to count and
913960	917240	In the decimal system that even the Romans didn't have
917600	924440	How likely do you think it is that something that significant would be enjoyed by descendants in hundreds or thousands of years?
924440	927480	Or do you think that that kind of basic numeracy level stuff?
928080	932840	Those kinds of thinking tools are basically all gone just so I understand the question right you're talking about how
933440	935440	Having a system for numbers
935800	942040	Changes the way that we think that then lends itself to a better understanding of the world like we can do commerce. Yeah, exactly
942760	944760	Or we can think in terms of orders of magnitude
944760	950400	Yeah, it would have been hard to think and we have the word orders of magnitude right in a way that is hard to write down much less
950400	954360	Think about if you're doing Roman numerals like is there something analogous to that?
954600	956600	descendants um, I
956840	959080	mean fluency with a
959760	963760	Programming interface really can help understanding certain problems
963760	969200	I think the when people mess around in a notebook with something and when it feels like a really good tool set
969240	976040	There's a way that that has the same sensation as adopting a nice notation in that you
976640	983120	Write something with a small number of symbols, but then you discover a lot about the implication of that in the case of notation
983120	986040	It's because the rules of algebra are very constrained
986040	992440	And so when you write something you can go through an almost game-like process to see how it reduces and expands and then see something
992440	995000	That might be non-trivial and in the case of programming
995320	1000520	Of course the machine is doing the crunching and you might get a plot that reveals some extra data
1000520	1007840	I think we're maybe at a phase where there's room for that to become as a much more fluid process such that
1008720	1014200	Rather than having these small little bits of friction like you've got to set up the environment and you got to like it in the notebook
1014200	1018440	You've got to like find the right libraries that there's something that feels as fluid as when you are
1020080	1023280	Good at algebra and you're just at a whiteboard kind of noodling it out
1023280	1028280	I think there's something to be said for the fact that there's still so much more value in
1029280	1032440	If you and I were to like go into some math topic right now, right?
1032440	1036680	You ask me something that's a terrible question for a podcast, but I'm like, oh, let's actually dig into it
1036920	1039080	The right medium to do that is still paper
1039080	1042040	I think like I would break out some paper and we would scribble it out
1042040	1045880	And so whenever it becomes the case that the right medium to do that
1046280	1049160	Lends itself to simulation and to programming and all that
1049520	1054760	That feels like it would get to the point where it shifts the way that you even think about stuff. Yeah, that's really interesting
1055400	1056840	What's up with miracle years?
1056840	1062200	So this is something that happens has happened throughout science and especially with mathematicians
1062480	1068600	Where they have a single year in which they wake up many if not most of the important discoveries that they happen the career
1068920	1074360	You know Newton, Einstein, Gauss, they all had these years. Do you have some explanation of what's going on?
1075240	1077240	What's your take? I
1077280	1079360	Think there's a bunch of possible explanations
1079360	1084480	It can't just be youth because youth last ten years not one year
1084680	1087880	So it must have something to do with every 35 year old right now
1090520	1096160	You know, you know what I mean made 20 years. Yeah, so yeah, but it can't just be that
1096880	1101320	I don't know. There's a bunch of possible things you could say one is you're in a situation in life
1101320	1105520	Where you have nothing else going for you or you just like really free for that one year
1105520	1110120	And then you become successful after that year is over based on what you did. Yeah, but what is your take?
1110120	1114800	I don't know. I so I agree. That's probably multiple factors not one
1115520	1117520	one thing could be that
1118120	1124000	The miracle year is the like exhalation and there's been many many years of inhalation
1124280	1129120	Where often let's say, you know, the classic one is Einstein's where his make miracle year
1129120	1133920	we're also some of the first papers like kind of springing on to the scene and I
1134560	1136560	Would guess that a lot of the ideas
1136960	1138240	were not
1138240	1140280	bumping around his head only in that year
1140280	1146240	but it's like many many years of thinking about it and kind of coalescing and so you might be in a position where you can build up all
1146240	1147280	of this
1147280	1149280	potential energy and then
1149520	1153600	For whatever reason there's one time in life that lends itself to actually releasing all of that
1154600	1156600	If I try to reflect on like my own
1157040	1162240	History with what I'm doing now. I think I didn't appreciate early on how much potential energy
1162240	1169960	I was working from simply from being a student and in college where there's just a bunch of ways of thinking about things or empathy with new learners or
1170840	1172520	Just cool concepts, right?
1172520	1178640	The basic concept behind a video that in fact it was many many years of like all of my time having learned math
1179080	1184840	Before I started putting out stuff online that I was able to eat into and then maybe it was a little later where
1185120	1186680	Okay, the well never runs dry
1186680	1192080	There's always a long list of things that I want to cover but in some sense like I recognize that the well was
1192840	1198280	at risk of running dry in a way that I never thought that it could and without being a little deliberate about
1199720	1205400	Devoting some of my day not just to output and producing but to stepping back and like learning new things and touching something
1205440	1207520	I never would have that doesn't happen by default
1207520	1213720	I don't know if this is all but also the case for the people who have genuine miracle years where they were like letting out all of
1213720	1217960	This stuff and then it takes a decade to build up that same level of potential energy
1218760	1220240	The other thing
1220240	1224920	You have everything to gain and nothing to lose when you are young. So even if it's not merely youth
1225160	1228160	There's a willingness to be creative and there's also
1229000	1233520	None of the obligations that come from having found success before right
1234200	1238960	You know, there's there's certain academics who made an extremely deliberate effort not to let
1239640	1244160	What would they call it? Is it like the curse of success or there's some time for but I think maybe
1245040	1250760	James Watson, you know had this standard reply to invitations for you know talks and interviews and things like that
1250760	1255000	It was basically like no to everyone because I just want to be a scientist
1255040	1259400	it was much more articulate than that and he has all these nine points, but that was the gist of it and
1260160	1261320	Short of doing that
1261320	1266080	I think it's very easy for someone to have a lot of other things that eat into their mind share and time and all of that that
1266200	1271080	Even if it's just 20 hours a week like actually that that really interrupts a creative flow
1271720	1273720	Were you a student when you started the channel?
1274520	1280400	Technically, yeah, the very very first video was made when I was a senior at Stanford
1281280	1288880	Basically, I'd been like toying around with just a personal programming project in my last year of college that was the beginnings of what is now like
1288880	1294320	The animation tool I work with I didn't intend for it to be a thing that I would use as a math youtuber
1294320	1298160	I didn't even really know what a youtuber was. It was really just like a personal project
1298600	1302120	And it was March of that year
1302120	1307120	I think that I published the first ever video and so it was kind of right at that transition point
1307120	1313120	Do you think you could you would have done it if you had let's say become I don't know what you're planning on doing after college
1313120	1317720	I remember you saying somewhere maybe a data scientist, but data scientist and math PhD were the two like
1318480	1323200	50-50 contenders basically is there a role then which he started doing that but then later on
1323720	1330160	Made manum or do you think that that was only possible in a world where you had some time to kill in your senior year?
1330160	1334360	if the goal was to make math youtube videos, it would have been a
1335160	1339680	wild thing to do to do it by like making manum as the method for it because
1340280	1344480	It's so strikingly inefficient to do it that way at the very least
1344480	1347840	I probably would have built on top of an existing framework if I had
1347840	1352440	I mean there's so many things that I would tell my past self if I could go back in time even if the goal was to make that
1352440	1357440	It's like certain design decisions that caused pain that could have been fixed earlier on
1357880	1362160	But if the goal was to make videos, there's just so many good tools for making videos
1362160	1365720	I probably would have started with those or if I wanted to script things
1365720	1370960	Maybe I would have first learned after effects really effectively and then learn the scripting languages around after effects
1370960	1372880	That might have even been better for all I know
1372880	1375440	I really don't know but I just kind of walked into it because I
1376040	1381880	The initial project was to make something that could illustrate certain ideas and math especially when it came to
1382560	1386600	Visualizing functions as transformations mapping inputs to outputs as opposed to graphing
1387040	1390840	the the video output was just a way of knowing that I had
1391680	1398560	Completed that personal project in some sense and then it turned out to be fun because I also really enjoy teaching and really enjoy tutoring and stuff
1399120	1399920	I
1399920	1404680	Don't know then again. There's a lot of other people who make their own tools
1405600	1407600	for math gifts and
1407800	1414560	Little illustrations and things which on the one hand feels very inefficient like there's I don't know if people come across a math
1414560	1422720	Gift on Wikipedia. There's a very high probability it comes from this one individual who just strangely prolific at producing these like creative commons visuals and
1423400	1427080	He has his own like home baked thing for how he does it and then there's
1427640	1428880	someone who
1428920	1433760	Came across on Twitter Matt Matt Henderson who has these completely beautiful
1434320	1436520	Math gifts and such and again
1436520	1439360	It's a very home baked thing that is like built on top of
1439720	1441800	Shaders, but he kind of has his own stuff there
1441800	1446320	And maybe there's something to be said for the level of ownership that you feel once it is your own thing that just
1446480	1448480	unlocks a sense of creativity and
1448480	1453400	Feeling like hey, I can just describe whatever I want because if I can't already do it
1453400	1455400	I'll just change the tool to make it able to do that
1455880	1461960	For all I know that level of creative freedom is necessary to like take on a wide variety of topics, but
1462640	1467360	Your guess is as good as mine for those counterfactuals. Yeah, this is personally interesting to me
1467760	1473080	Because I also started the podcast in college and I just like was off track of anything
1473080	1478120	I was planning on doing otherwise and if this is you know, many many orders of magnitude away from through the one round
1478120	1483320	I don't want the audience to you know, cringe in unison, but I just think it's interesting like these kinds of projects
1483360	1484720	How often
1484720	1489840	Something that I don't know later on ends up being successful is something that was started almost on a whim as a hobby
1490120	1491880	You know when you're in college or something like that
1491880	1497440	I will say there's a benefit to starting it in a way that is low stakes like you're not banking on it growing
1497440	1499440	I I had no
1499440	1502600	Anticipation of much less an expectation of three blown round growing
1502600	1508160	I think the reason I kind of kept doing it was in the fork of life if I did the math PhD and all that
1508160	1513200	I thought it might be a good idea to have a little bit of a footprint on the internet for math exposition
1513320	1517160	I was thinking of it as like a very niche thing that you know
1517160	1519720	Maybe some math students and some people who are into math would like it
1519720	1524880	But I could sort of show the stuff as a portfolio not as a as an audience
1524880	1528600	You know size that was meaningful and I think I was surprised by what an appetite
1528600	1534840	There was for the kind of things that I was making and in some ways maybe that's helpful because I see a lot of people who
1535640	1540400	Jump in they they jump in with the goal of being a youtuber. I think it's the most common
1541360	1545560	Desired job among the youth is to be like a tiktoker or a youtuber which think of that
1545560	1548280	Well, but when you jump in with that as a goal
1548280	1554160	You kind of aim for too large an audience and end up making the content which is best for no one
1554160	1556440	Because one you're probably not that good at making videos yet
1556440	1560400	And so you're competing if it's a general a generally applicable idea
1560680	1563320	You're competing with like all of the other communicators out there
1564080	1566280	Whereas if you do something that's almost
1566840	1572880	Unreasonably niche and also you're not expecting it to blow up. It's like one you're not going to be disappointed
1572880	1577320	It's like outstanding when a thousand people view it as opposed to being disappointing and then two
1578160	1583560	You might be making something that is the best possible version of that content for the audience who watches it
1583560	1587240	because no one else is making that for them because it's too narrow a target and
1587920	1591120	That's sort of the beauty of the internet is that there is an incentive to do that
1591640	1595440	And I don't know if this is the case with your podcast when you're starting off where
1596160	1602760	Not thinking about oh, how can I make this as big as possible actually made it more in-depth for those who were listening to it
1603000	1607920	Is it surprising to you that prehistoric humans don't seem to have had
1608960	1614320	Just basic arithmetic and numeracy to me with with a sort of I guess to us with the modern
1615080	1619120	Understanding that kind of stuff seems so universally useful and so fundamental
1619640	1623960	That it's shocking that it just doesn't come about naturally in the course of interacting with the world
1624640	1629280	Do you think it's is that surprising that it's just a concept of numbers and you're right
1629280	1633800	It's so in our bones that it's hard to empathize with not having a numeracy a
1634640	1636880	Lot of it's linked to if you think okay
1636880	1640880	What's the first place that like people think about numbers most people like in their daily lives?
1641040	1648480	It's linked to commerce and money and such so maybe some ways the question is the same as saying is it surprising that like early
1648800	1651680	Humanity didn't have commerce or didn't deal with money
1652360	1655920	Maybe when you're below Dunbar's number in your communities
1656360	1660040	Like a tit for tat structure just makes a lot more sense and actually works well
1660040	1662560	And it would just be obnoxious to like actually account for everything
1663240	1667780	The other loosely related idea. Have you come across those?
1668480	1669400	studies where
1669400	1676840	When anthropologists will interview tribes of people that are removed enough from normal society that they don't have the level of numeracy that you're
1676840	1679520	I do but they you know, there's some notion of counting you
1679640	1686880	If you have one coconut or nine coconuts like you have a sense of that that if you ask what number is halfway between one and nine
1687840	1689840	Those groups will answer three
1690480	1696840	Whereas you or I or people in our world would probably answer five and because we think on this very linear scale
1697120	1701320	It's interesting that evidently the like natural way to think about things is logarithmically
1701880	1709480	Which it kind of makes sense like the social dynamics of as you go from solitude to a group of ten people to a group
1709480	1716880	Of 100 people have roughly equal steps in increasing complexity more so than if you go from like one to fifty one to a hundred and two and
1717280	1721960	I wonder if it's it's the case that by adding numeracy in some senses
1721960	1727840	We've also like lost some numeracy or lost some intuition in others where now if you ask, you know
1728440	1732720	Middle school teachers. What's a difficult topic to teacher for students to understand? They're like logarithms
1733800	1736200	But that should be deep in our bones, right?
1736280	1740840	So somehow it got unlearned in the needs to be maybe it's in the formal sense that it's harder to relearn it
1740840	1741840	but there's
1741840	1745320	there's maybe a sense of like numeracy and a sense of quantitative thinking that
1746160	1751800	Humans naturally do have that is hard to appreciate when it's not expressed in the same language or in the same ways
1752280	1754800	Yeah, I have seen the thing from Joseph Henrich where
1755360	1757360	This still existing tribes were
1758080	1761720	They're in this kind of situation. They can do
1762400	1766480	Numeracy and arithmetic when it's in very concrete terms if you talk about seeds or something
1766520	1771480	But that the abstract concept of a number is not is not available to them
1772320	1778720	Do you think the abstract concept of a number is useful to your life? Oh, yeah, like in what ways?
1779480	1782960	It's almost like asking how is the concept of the alphabet useful
1782960	1788480	It comes up so often that it's I mean just like how many lights do I set up for this interview, right?
1788560	1794160	It's not the concept of an abstract number though because it's like two people two lights one-to-one correspondence
1794160	1798640	like did you leverage the abstraction of two as a
1799320	1803440	Object, which is simultaneously a rational and a real and an integer. I see
1803880	1808920	You know is in the context of a group that has additive structure, but also multiply
1810040	1816160	There's light for you light for me, right? Yeah, I'm pretty sure the abstract idea of a number is important for all of us
1816160	1818160	but I don't think it's
1819120	1825140	Immediately obvious. It's more that it shapes the way we think. I'm not sure if it actually changes like the way we live
1826160	1830760	If you assume you don't work in STEM, right? We're like you literally are using it all the time
1831440	1835240	Yeah, I'm trying to go through my day and think through what where am I using them?
1835240	1840040	I mean, there's the obvious stuff like the commerce examples you mentioned where you go to a restaurant
1840040	1843840	You're figuring out what to pay or what to tip, but that seems a very particular example
1843840	1848180	Do I really use numbers that infrequently? I don't know. Yeah
1849480	1855040	Many people listening are probably screaming out of their head like much more apt examples, but
1856720	1858400	It's hard to say yeah, yeah
1858400	1865760	Well when a mathematician is working on a problem, what is the biggest mental constraint? Is it working memory? Is it processing speed?
1866400	1871040	Plants are limited by nitrogen usually like what is the equivalent of nitrogen for a mathematician?
1871640	1875120	That's a fun question. I mean, so I'm not a research mathematician
1875240	1880840	I shouldn't pretend like I am and so the right people to ask that question would be the research mathematicians. I
1881640	1886200	Wonder if you're gonna get consistent answers as with so many things. There's not one
1888560	1890240	Maybe
1890240	1892240	the number of available
1893200	1896680	Analogies to be able to draw connections like the more
1897520	1902320	Exposure you've had to disparate fields such that you could maybe see oh a problem-solving approach that was used here
1902320	1906080	might be useful here sometimes that's literally codified in the forms of
1906920	1912240	Connections between different fields as you know functors between categories or something like that, but sometimes it's a lot more
1913280	1918000	Intuitive the idea that a general flavor of an you know, someone's doing a
1919240	1924840	Combinatorics type question and they're like oh maybe generating functions are this useful like tool to bring to bear and then in some completely
1924840	1929960	Different context of studying like prime numbers. They're like, oh, maybe it could take a generating function type approach
1930560	1932560	Maybe you have to massage it to make it work
1932560	1938840	And the one of the reasons I say this is one of the tendencies that you've seen in math papers
1939320	1941320	In let's say to like the last 200 years
1941400	1945880	The typical number of authors is like much bigger now than before you people have this
1945880	1951760	I think misconception that math is a field with lone geniuses who are off like coming up with great insights like alone next to a
1951760	1956280	Blackboard and the reality is it's a highly collaborative field. I remember one of the first
1956880	1960360	Times that I was hearing from a mathematician's like a young kid
1960360	1965280	And I was in this math circles event and someone was asking this person like what surprised you about your job
1965400	1969560	But the first thing he said was how much travel was involved that he wasn't expecting that
1970040	1976000	And it's because you know if you're studying some very specific niche field that the way that you make progress in that is by
1976040	1981200	Collaborating with other people like in that field or maybe adjacent to that field and there's only so many about them
1981200	1986040	They probably aren't at your university. So you travel a lot to work with them these days a lot of that
1986040	1990260	I think happens on on zoom, but conferences are still super important and these sorts of
1990840	1997000	Events that bring people all under one roof like MSRI is maybe an example of a place that's trying to does that systematically
1997800	1999480	and
1999480	2002600	You could say that's a social thing, you know get get more ideas
2002600	2007200	But I think it's maybe hitting on this idea that what you want is exposure to as many available analogies
2007720	2012600	So the short answer to your question is like the nitrogen for mathematician is the analogy
2012840	2016800	This actually is an interesting question. I wasn't planning on asking you, but it just occurred to me
2016800	2023200	Is it surprising how new a lot of mathematics is even mathematics that has taught at the high school level
2023400	2026560	Whereas with physics or biology, that's also new
2026560	2030720	But you can tell a story where we didn't have the tools to look at the cell or to
2031160	2037600	Inspect an electron until very recently, but we've had mathematicians for two three thousand years who were doing
2038240	2043680	You know pretty sophisticated things even the ancient Greeks not depends on what you mean by sophisticated, but impressive things
2043680	2046600	I don't know why linear algebra is so new given that fact
2046600	2052080	I wouldn't have thought of math as being like new in that way if anything especially for talking at the high school level
2052080	2058600	I remember there's always a sensation that it's frustrating that all of the things are actually a way more than a hundred years old
2059160	2064400	In terms of you know that the names attached to the theorems that you're doing like none of them are remotely modern
2064520	2066640	whereas in biology, you know the
2067960	2074760	Understanding we have for like how proteins are formed is relatively much more modern and you might be just a couple generations away
2074760	2078840	I at some extent there's a raw manpower component to it
2078840	2083160	We're like how many people did pure math for most of history for most of history?
2083360	2085680	No one no one was a pure mathematician
2085680	2089600	They were like a mathematician plus something else or they were a physicist who you know
2089600	2094140	They were a natural philosopher and in so far as you're doing like natural philosophy one component of that is
2094500	2100820	Developing math, but it's not the full extent of what you do, you know, even the ones who we think of is like very very
2101940	2107940	Pure mathematicians in the sense that a lot of their most famous results are pure math like gauss actually a lot of the work
2108460	2112900	a lot of his you know output was also centered on very practical problems and
2114180	2120200	Yeah, and maybe like since then that's when you start to get an era of something more like pure mathematicians and
2121080	2127000	The raw number available that you have that man hours that are being put into developing new theorems is
2127760	2134200	Probably just got this huge spike as one the population grows and then also the percentage of the population that has the economic freedom to do
2134200	2136660	Something as indulgent as academia like grows
2137440	2141760	Maybe it's pretty reasonable that most of it is much much more recent
2142920	2144080	That would be my guess
2144080	2148960	But I mean some of these things seem actually pretty modern like information theory is less than a hundred years old
2148960	2154720	That's true, and it's you know pretty fundamental like theoretically you could have written that paper a long time ago
2154720	2155840	That's a really good example
2155840	2160680	And maybe like this is a sign that the math that's developed is more in the service of
2160840	2164080	The world that you live in and the adjacent problems that it's used to solve
2164160	2169720	Then we typically think of it on the one hand information theory such a good example because it's so pure that
2170120	2173040	You could have asked the question you could have defined the notion of a bit
2173080	2176600	But evidently there wasn't a strong enough need to think in that way
2176920	2182480	Whereas when you're doing error correction or you're thinking about actual information channels over
2182480	2188920	You know a wire and you're at Bell Labs that that's that's what prompts it another maybe really good example for that would be chaos theory
2188920	2191680	You could easily ask why why is chaos theory so recent?
2192000	2197440	You could have you know written the Lorenz equations since differential equations existed
2197840	2202200	Why didn't anyone do that and understand that there was this sort of sensitivity to initial conditions?
2202240	2209120	And in that case it would maybe be the opposite where it's not that you need the existence of computers as a problem
2209240	2212440	To solve or the problems that they introduce of the problems to solve
2212560	2217880	But instead you need them to even discover the phenomenon in the first place like a lot of original
2218440	2223000	Concepts in chaos theory came from basically running simulations or doing things that required a
2224080	2228520	Massive amount of computation that simply wouldn't be done by hand someone could ask the question
2228520	2231560	but they wouldn't have observed the unexpected phenomenon and
2232240	2234040	There even if it's
2234040	2240840	Questions that are as relevant to a pre-computer world as to a post-computer world like the nature of weather modeling or just the nature
2241160	2243280	Three-body problem like all of that kind of stuff
2244520	2250400	Somehow without the right tools for thought it just didn't come into the mind and so maybe yeah, maybe there's
2251280	2253280	other things like that where
2254120	2256120	those
2256360	2260000	Questions were pieces of technology that start to fundamentally shape everyone's life
2260320	2264080	Will then invariably also shift like the mathematicians focus
2264520	2270200	Mmm. This actually reminds me the first day of Scott Ironson's quantum information class
2270360	2275160	He said that what I'm about to describe to you could have been discovered by a mathematician
2275680	2279280	Before you know quantum physics existed if only they'd ask the question
2279840	2281160	We're gonna do probabilities
2281160	2285760	But we're only allowed to use unitaries and the rest of it is a you know
2285760	2288440	You could have just discovered of quantum mechanics or quantum information from there
2288440	2293280	I mean the thing about math right, especially if you're talking about pure axiomatized math
2293800	2299280	the experience as a student as an undergrad is that you are going through a textbook and it starts with saying
2299280	2305720	Here's the axioms of this field and then we're gonna deduce from those axioms like various different lemmas and theorems and proceed from that and
2306680	2311520	With that as the framing you get the impression that you could have just come up with any axioms
2312240	2317280	Make up some pile of axioms deduce what follows from them and the space of possible like math is
2317960	2321240	Unfathomably huge and so you need some process that calls down
2321280	2327920	What are the useful things to maybe pursue and so one of the things that I think is all too often missing in those pure math
2328000	2334800	Textbooks is the basically the motivating problem. Why is it that this was the set of axioms people found to be useful and not something else?
2334920	2341000	You know the framework for quantum information theory. It's like you married together linear linear algebra and probability
2341160	2341920	That's great
2341920	2347280	but there's all sorts of other things where you could kind of try to cram them together and maybe get some sort of math out and
2348240	2351400	The the question becomes is it worth your time to do that?
2351600	2358440	You know not theory is something that emerged because I think it was Lord Kelvin had a theory that all of the
2359000	2360360	like
2360360	2363560	elements on the periodic table had structures which were
2364360	2369040	Related to a knot like a knot being if you have a closed loop in 3d space
2369200	2373120	But maybe if you want to continuously deform it without it ever crossing itself
2373280	2378320	You ask the question like could you get back to say an open loop or if you can't get back to an open loop
2378320	2382280	What are the set of all other loops in 3d space that could be deformed into that?
2382280	2386960	And you end up categorizing what all the different knots are and this was started with a
2387560	2391880	completely incorrect theory for what's going on at the atomic level that gives
2392480	2398080	Adams this very stable structure because I think you you found with smoke rings like if you're
2398520	2401160	Somehow very dexterous with how you create these smoke rings
2401160	2406960	You can get them to form knots in 3d and they're they're very stable. It's like weirdly stable in the it'll never
2407400	2411680	You know cross over itself, and so it has all those properties now
2411920	2415200	That was irrelevant for understanding the periodic table
2415200	2418080	But it was an interesting mathematical question and people kind of ran with it
2418160	2423440	And in that case it was an arbitrary reason that someone thought to ask the question and then some people ran with it
2423440	2428520	And frankly, it's probably fewer people who run with it than would if it turned out to be a more useful question
2429160	2433600	So really you want to ask like what are the what are the things that prompt people to ask?
2433600	2439880	What turns out to be a mathematical question given that the space of what would be mathematical questions is so unfathomably huge that it's
2440040	2443040	It's just impossible to explore it through a random walk wait
2443040	2447640	Are you saying that lord kelvin's apple hitting you in story was that he was smoking a lot of pipe
2449720	2456600	Categorizes the puffs yeah, I can't remember if it was smoke rings out of his mouth, but I mean that's a natural place
2456600	2458600	We should look into that
2459480	2467040	Okay, so you you've changed how you and other creators have changed how pedagogy happens via animated videos
2468000	2475480	What would it take to do something similar for video games text all these other mediums? Why hasn't there been a similar sort of
2476280	2479760	broad-scale adoption and transformation of how teaching happens there
2480440	2482440	I'm not sure I understand the question you're saying
2483720	2491600	Where there's been a rise of explanatory videos. Yeah, why is there not a similar rise in like pedagogical video games? Yeah, and
2492480	2493960	well
2493960	2497000	One thing to understand I guess games are very hard to make
2498040	2500680	it takes a lot of resources for a given game and
2502000	2508840	Whenever people seem to try to do it with pedagogy as a motive like they're making some game whose goal is to teach something I
2509880	2510960	Don't play enough games
2510960	2516280	So I can't really speak to it the way that well-versed game designers can it seems to be the case that they are not
2517000	2523240	Fun in the way that people would want them to be fun and then the ones that are actually most effective are not
2524080	2526080	You know as directly educational
2526840	2530720	So there's clearly some of the one the one game that I actually have played
2531040	2535880	Because enough of my friends told me hey, you should really do this. It seems relevant to not explanation
2536120	2539680	In the last like decade was the witness. Yeah, have you played it? I've heard about it
2540000	2545400	So as someone who doesn't play games and then did play it. It's fantastic
2545400	2549480	It's absolutely well done in every possible way that you could want something to be well done
2550040	2552040	and critical on that is the
2552480	2557560	nature of how problems are solved the reason people were recommending it to me is because the feeling of playing the witness is a
2557560	2559560	Lot like the feeling of doing math
2559560	2561120	It's non-verbal
2561120	2567280	You come across these little puzzles where the simple mechanics of one puzzle inform you about the fundamental
2567560	2571760	Mechanics that become relevant to much much harder ones such that if you do it with the right sequence
2571880	2575880	you have the feeling of epiphany in ways that are like very self-satisfying and
2576640	2578640	You can you come away feeling like man
2578920	2583920	You should be able to do something like this for math and maybe you can and it's just that
2584160	2586680	It's so hard to make a game at all
2586680	2592320	That there's just not the rate of production that you would need to explore like get enough games out there that one of them
2592320	2598040	Hits because with YouTube, there's a lot of math videos on YouTube. It's okay that most of them suck
2598040	2599800	Right, it's okay because hey
2599800	2604560	You just need enough that when someone searches for the term that they want they get one that is good and scratches that itch
2604880	2608600	or that you know, they might get recommended something that is
2609720	2613840	Bringing a question to their mind that they wouldn't have thought about but they become really interested once it's there
2614120	2620400	Whereas with video games, I don't know. You're also spending a lot more time as a user on each one rather than a five-minute average
2620720	2624800	Experience, it's like a many many hour average experience. You ask the question on text
2624800	2627560	I don't know if I accept the premise that there's not the same
2628120	2630120	advances and
2631080	2637240	Innovation in the world of textual explanations like math a gun is a really really good example of this that's
2637720	2639720	Like the textbook of the future
2640120	2643240	It's a website. It's basically an interactive textbook
2643480	2648560	The explanations are really good and in so far as it doesn't have more of an impact or more of a reach
2648560	2652600	It's maybe just because people don't know about it or don't have an easy means of accessing
2653280	2655280	Something that recommends to them like the really good
2656280	2658280	innovations happening in the world of
2658640	2665160	Textual explanations in the way that YouTube has this recommending engine that tries its hardest to get more of these things in front of people
2665680	2669240	And I'm quite sure that in the world of actual like written textbooks
2669320	2675280	You I mean, there's so many that I like so much that I think it would be a disservice to talk about that
2676000	2678680	medium is not like making advances in terms of
2679200	2685680	More and more thought put towards empathy to the learner and things like that. Should the top point one percent of educators
2685840	2692720	Should they be exclusively on the internet because it seems like a waste if you were just a college professor or a high school professor
2692720	2695320	And you were teaching 50 kids a year or something
2696000	2700840	Given the greater scale available should should more of them be trying to see if they can reach more people
2700840	2706200	I think it's not a bad thing for more educators who are good at what they're doing to put their stuff online for sure
2706200	2710400	I highly encourage that even if it's as simple as getting someone to put a camera in the back of the classroom
2710400	2714680	I don't think it would be a good idea to get those people out of the classroom if anything
2714680	2720360	I think one of the best things that I could do for my career would be to put myself into more classrooms
2720600	2726320	And actually I'm quite determined at some point to like be a high school math teacher for some number of years
2726320	2729960	I don't know when there's such opportunity cost. I guess
2730960	2736080	Probably it's something I would plan on like notably later as long as there's not other like
2736400	2743760	Life logistics that occupy a lot of mind share because everything I know about high school teaching is like it just kicks your ass for the first
2743760	2746960	Right two years, but I would say I
2747840	2753280	One of the most valuable things that you can have if you're trying to explain stuff online is a sense of empathy for what the possible
2753480	2755480	Viewers are like that that are out there
2755640	2760920	The more distance that you put between yourself and them in terms of life circumstances
2760920	2762480	You know, I'm not a college student
2762480	2766960	So I don't have the same empathy with what a college students like certainly not a high school student
2766960	2773520	So I've lost that empathy that distance just makes it more and more of an uphill battle to make the content good for them and
2774120	2775520	I think
2775520	2781120	Keeping people in regular touch with just what people in the classroom actively need is
2781800	2784320	Necessary for them to remain as good and as sharp as they are
2784360	2788440	So yes get more of those top 0.1 percent to put their stuff online
2788440	2793560	But like I would absolutely disagree with the idea of taking them out of their existing circumstances
2794040	2798000	Maybe for a year or two so they don't lose that sharpness, but then like put them right back in
2798680	2800520	because
2800520	2803320	One it makes them better at the online explicit position, but also
2805160	2808600	The other thing I might disagree with is the idea that the reach is lower
2809400	2810520	Because
2810520	2812880	Okay, yes, it's a smaller number of people
2813200	2817720	But you're with them for much much more time and you actually have the chance of influencing their trajectory
2818200	2823440	through a social connection in a way that you you just don't over YouTube and
2823840	2829440	I think you're using the word education in a way that I would maybe sub out for the word explanation
2829440	2831720	like you want explanations to be online but like
2832400	2838200	Education the word education derives from the same route as the word educe like to bring out
2838760	2842200	And I really like that as a bit of etymology because it reminds you that
2842760	2846920	The job of an educator is not to like take their knowledge and shove it into the heads of someone else
2847000	2848840	The job is to bring it out
2848840	2851880	That's very very hard to do in a video and in fact
2852520	2857160	Even if you can kind of get at it by asking intriguing questions for the most part the video is there to
2858120	2860120	Answer something once someone has a question and
2860760	2866280	The teacher's job or the educator's job should be to provide the environment such that you're bringing out from your students as much as you can
2866600	2867600	through
2867600	2872440	Inspirated through projects through little bits of mentorship and encouragement along the way that
2873160	2879720	Requires, you know eye contact and being there in person and being at the true figure in their life rather than just an abstract voice behind a screen
2880440	2883240	Then should we think of educators more as motivational speakers?
2883880	2886440	As in the actual job of getting the content in your head
2887000	2889880	Is is maybe for the textbooks or for the youtube
2890120	2893800	But now the job like why we have college classes or high school classes
2894200	2898600	Is we have somebody who approximates tony robbins to you know get you to do the thing?
2899000	2903960	That would be a subset of it, but there's there's more than just motivational speech that goes into it, right?
2904200	2905320	there's
2905320	2910280	Facilitation of projects or even coming up with what the project projects are or recognizing
2910520	2915320	What a student is interested in so that you can try to tailor a question to their specific set of interests
2915640	2922040	Or you can maybe act as the curator where hey, there's a lot of online explanations for what a Poisson distribution is
2922280	2926920	You know okay, which of these is the right one that I could serve and based on knowing you as a particular student
2927000	2929800	What might resonate you might be in a better position to do that?
2930440	2932200	all of that
2932200	2933640	goes beyond
2933640	2939320	Being a tony robbins out, you know saying like oh you be the best person that you can be and all of that
2940120	2941320	and
2941320	2944440	One one thing I might say is that anytime that I'll chat with
2944840	2949560	Mathematicians and try to get a sense for how they got into it what got them started so so often
2950120	2952120	It starts by saying well, there was this one teacher
2952680	2954600	And that teacher did something very small
2954680	2957160	They like pulled them aside and just said hey, you're really good at this
2957240	2961240	Have you considered studying more or they give them an interesting problem and the thing that takes
2962040	2966760	Like at most 30 minutes of the teacher's time, maybe even 30 seconds has these
2967320	2973320	Completely monumental rippling effects for the life of the student they were talking to that then sets this them on this whole different trajectory
2973800	2976600	um two examples of this come to mind actually one is
2977480	2979880	This woman who was saying she had this moment
2979880	2981800	She got pulled aside from the teacher
2981800	2984200	And he just said like hey, I think you're really good at math
2984280	2988040	He should consider being a math major which had been completely outside of her
2988440	2992360	Like purview at that time and that like changed the way she thought about it
2992760	2996120	And then later she said she learned that he like did that for a large number of people
2998040	2999560	Hey, you're really good at that
2999560	3005000	Um, so that's a level of impact that you can have in person as a as a figure in their lives in a way that you can't over a screen
3005960	3011800	Then another one which was very funny. I was asking this guy why he went into the specific field that he did
3012360	3014920	It was a seemingly arbitrary thing in my mind
3015560	3019320	But I guess all all pure math seems to be and he said that he
3020040	3022760	for his first year of grad school was um
3023240	3027880	Sitting in this seminar and at the end of the seminar the professor who was this you know old professor
3027880	3031480	He had never met him before they didn't have any kind of connection. He six this guy out
3031560	3033240	He comes up and he says you
3033240	3036680	I have a problem for you a good research problem that I think I think might be um
3037160	3040280	A good place for you to start in the next couple months and this guy was like
3040760	3045640	Oh, okay, and he like gets this research problem and he spends some months thinking about it and he comes back
3046360	3049000	And then it later came to light that the professor
3049640	3051640	Mistook him for someone else
3052680	3056040	Someone he was supposed to be mentoring and so he was just like
3056200	3060520	Like the the stereotypical image of like a doddering old math professor
3060520	3065240	Who's not very in tune with the people in his life that was the actual situation actual situation
3065480	3071560	But nevertheless that moment of accidentally giving someone a problem completely shifted the research path for him
3072120	3078280	Which if nothing else shows you the sensitivity to initial conditions that takes place when you are a student
3079160	3080280	and how
3080280	3082280	the educator
3082360	3087160	Is is right on that nexus of sensitivity who can completely swing the fences one way or another for
3087640	3090760	um what you do and for every one of those stories there's going to be
3091560	3098440	An unfortunate counter balancing story about people who are demotivated from math. I mean I um, I think this was seventh grade
3098920	3100520	there was
3100520	3102520	this math class that I was in
3103080	3108040	And I was one of the people who was like good at math and enjoyed it and would often like help the people in the class
3108120	3110120	Understand it and all that and so I I had enough
3111000	3114840	ego built up I guess to have like a strong shell around things and
3115640	3119880	I guess for context there were I also really liked music and there was this like a concert that had happened
3120040	3123400	Where I had like a certain solo or something earlier in the day or earlier in that week
3123880	3126280	And there was a substitute teacher on one day
3126440	3129800	So she didn't have like any of the context and she gave some lesson
3130120	3134680	And then had that's been the second half of the class going over the um the homework for it
3135320	3138760	all of the other students in the class were very confused and
3139240	3142440	I think I remember like they would kind of come to me and I would try to offer to help them
3143080	3148920	And the substitute was going around the class in these circles and basically marking off a little star for how far down the homework
3149080	3153640	People were just to get a sense. Are they progressing and that was kind of her way of measuring. Are they very far?
3154280	3159160	And when she got to me I had done like none of them because I was spending my whole time trying to help all of the others
3159560	3165000	And she like after having written a little star next to the same problem like three different times
3165400	3167160	She said to me like, you know
3167160	3169160	Sometimes music people just aren't math people
3169720	3171320	And it keeps walking on
3171320	3176840	So now I was in the best possible circumstance to not let that hit hard because like one
3177160	3180360	I had the moral high ground of like, hey, I've just been helping all these people
3180360	3185560	Like I understand it and I've been doing your job for you. This was my like little egotistical seventh grade brain
3186040	3187880	I I knew that I knew the stuff and things like that
3188280	3191960	Even still even with all of that as like the armor that was put up
3192200	3195000	I remember it was just this like shock to my system
3195000	3197720	You know, she says this thing and it just made me like
3198440	3200520	Strangely teary-eyed or something
3200520	3204120	And I can only imagine if you're in a position where you're not confident in math
3204120	3207400	And the thing that you know deep in your heart is actually you are kind of struggling with it
3207720	3214520	Just a little throwaway comment like that could completely derail the whole system in terms of your relationship with the subject. So it's another
3215800	3221720	Example to illustrate the sensitivity to initial conditions, right where there, you know, I was I wasn't a robust position
3221720	3227160	It wasn't as sensitive I was I was gonna love math no matter what but you envision someone who's a little bit more on that teetering edge
3227240	3230360	And the comment one way or another either saying you're good at this
3230360	3235000	You should consider majoring in it or saying sometimes music people aren't math people which isn't even
3235720	3236760	True
3236760	3239000	Or you know what I mean like that was the other thing about it that
3240200	3242520	That like niggled at my brain when she said it
3243080	3248280	Yeah, I all all of that is just so important for people's development that
3249160	3254040	When people talk about online education as being you know valuable or revolutionary or anything like that
3254600	3258840	There's a part of me that sort of rolls my eyes because it it just doesn't get at the truth that
3259400	3262520	Online explanations have nothing to do with all of that important stuff
3262520	3267560	That's actually happening and at best it should be like in the service of helping that that side of things
3267560	3269560	That's where the rubber meets the road
3269720	3275560	I had Tyler Cohen on the podcast and he obviously has marginal revolution university these youtube videos where the explains economics
3275960	3277960	And he had a similar answer to give
3278360	3283960	I think I asked basically why aren't you just replacing or should we think of you as a substitute for all these economics teachers?
3284440	3286440	And in his mind as well
3287320	3290600	He was more a compliment to to the functions that happen in
3291160	3293800	In the class um and to your point about the initial conditions
3293800	3297160	I'm sure you remember the details of the story, but I just vaguely remember hearing this
3297560	3302760	Wasn't their case where a mathematician who went later ended up becoming famous. He arrives to a lecture late
3303240	3307000	See do you want to tell the story? I don't remember it uh beat for beat
3307080	3311640	But I think it was a statistics class and he was a grad student and he comes in
3311880	3315080	It's late and there's two problems on the board that the professor had written
3315480	3318120	He assumed that those two problems were homework
3318440	3321400	And so he goes home and he like works on them and after a couple weeks
3321640	3326200	He goes to the professor's office and like turns in his homework and he's like, I'm sorry. I'm so late
3326200	3330280	This one it just took me a lot longer than some of the others and the professor's like, oh, okay
3330840	3332520	And just like shuffles it away
3332520	3336040	And then a couple days later when the prophet had the time to like go through and see them
3336360	3339400	He realized that the student had fully answered these questions
3339560	3343800	What the student didn't know is that they were not homework problems written on the chalkboard
3344040	3349640	They were two unsolved problems in the field that the prophet put up as examples of what the field was striving for
3350200	3354360	I don't remember what problems they were so that that would be more fun color to add to the story
3354680	3359480	But then at least as the anecdote told to me however many years ago goes
3359800	3364840	The prophet then like finds the student's housing and like knocks on the door. He's like, do you realize that like
3365720	3367720	these were actually unsolved problems and
3368200	3370200	Then he gets to basically make those his thesis
3370840	3371720	so
3371720	3373720	that yeah that idea of
3374200	3378760	Just being given something for completely random reasons and it and it shifts the course of what you do
3379320	3381320	Right, right, right or just
3381320	3383560	You know, it's a thing where if you know a cross sort of solvable
3383960	3388280	You just like you just keep going at it until you solve it whereas or the four-minute mile, right exactly
3388440	3392920	Yeah, exactly. That's a great example. I another valuable experience at least one I had was
3393960	3400840	Taking erranton's classes in college and realizing I am like at least two standard deviations below him
3401160	3405720	And that was actually a really valuable experience for me. Um, not because it increased my confidence in
3406600	3408600	I didn't I didn't have a moment where
3409160	3412120	I was like, oh, wow, I'm good at this but it was useful to know
3412840	3414840	You know, but podcasting is
3415160	3420520	An easier thing to do, right? So then it's good to know that there are actual technical things out there where
3421240	3426120	Knowing that you can get really deep into something and people are just going to be like way above you having that sort of awareness
3427000	3431640	Do you think it's fair to have a mental model that has a static
3432520	3438760	G factor type quality here such that your two standard deviations below and that is forever the state of things
3439400	3442840	Or do you think that the right mental model is something that allows for flexibility on
3443800	3447800	Where contributions actually come from or where intuitions come from that, you know
3447800	3450200	Through many years of experience and certain kinds of problem solving
3450200	3456680	Maybe what seemed like a flash of insight was actually like the residue of just years of thinking about certain kinds of puzzles that
3457080	3460680	He had that you maybe didn't you can answer like a story from that class actually
3461240	3462280	so
3462280	3467720	He's giving some proof about like how one complete it actually wasn't that he was giving a proof of that
3468120	3470920	I forgot the name of the method, but it's a very important method in complexity theory
3471320	3473880	that helped to prove the the bounds of
3475720	3477720	The complexity of different problems
3477880	3480440	And he explains it and he says, you know
3481240	3483240	In 1999
3483240	3488680	I I approved this myself, but I realized that six months before somebody had already published a paper
3489080	3493000	With this method and I realized I'm catching up to the frontier now, you know, but
3493880	3498280	When I was a kid I was like doing euler. That's like 2000 years in regress now and six months behind
3498680	3501480	And then so later on in the day, I'm like, wait 1999
3501960	3504280	How old was Scott Aaronson in 1999?
3504760	3507800	And I think it was 18 or 19 and he was basically
3509000	3513880	Proving from frontier results in complexity theory that were yeah, so at that point you're like
3514840	3518680	All right, Aaronson's a special animal here. You are right. He's probably a special animal
3519000	3521000	But it just it's just broadly good to know
3522040	3525720	Just like have that sort of upper constraint on your dining Kruger that you can
3526440	3528440	This exists in the world
3528920	3530920	Maybe the thing that I would want to say is that
3532120	3535560	Whatever the scale is on which he's two standard deviations above you
3535880	3541080	That might not be the one scale that matters and that like contributions to these fields don't always look like
3541720	3543720	genius insights and that
3543960	3551320	Sometimes there's there's fruit to be born from say becoming kind of an expert in two different things and then finding connections between them and like
3552280	3556280	The the people who make contributions are not necessarily the the Scott Aaronsons of the world
3557080	3559080	Still you are probably
3559320	3561000	The truth that there are
3561000	3564440	It's like von Neumann's another example of one of these, right? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah
3564920	3568040	Okay, how much does uh girdle's inclinus theorem
3568600	3574360	Practically matter. Is it is it something that comes up a lot or is it just a interesting thing to know about the bounds that?
3575720	3577320	Isn't day-to-day applicable
3577320	3582280	You've asked me another question where I'm not the best one to ask and I should throw that um as a caveat to begin
3582760	3584520	From what I understand
3584520	3589000	It really doesn't come up. I mean the the analogy to make um
3589560	3595080	The paradoxical fact that it's conveying the idea that you can't have an axiom system that is both um
3595960	3600440	That will basically like prove all of the things that are true and which is also self-consistent
3601000	3605800	The the contradiction that you construct out of that has the same feeling as the sentence
3606360	3610520	This statement is a lie. Well, you know, you think about the statement if it's false, then it must be true
3610520	3611960	If it's true, it must be false
3611960	3617240	It's that same flavor and you might ask does the existence of that paradox mean that it's hard to speak english
3618600	3619400	Yeah, that's interesting
3619400	3623560	It's so rare that you would come up with something that happens to have a bit of self-reference in it
3624040	3625240	there were
3625240	3627240	One of the first times that there was something that came up
3627720	3633800	That didn't feel quite as pathological in that way if the curious listener wants to go into it that search term would be
3633800	3635800	Paris Harrington theorems where
3636520	3637720	It's it's a little pathological
3637720	3643640	But it wasn't the really a question that came up that didn't seem like it was deliberately constructed to be one of these
3644040	3646040	self-referential things where you know
3646040	3649800	It it shows itself to be outside the bounds of whatever axiom system
3650440	3655800	You were starting with and it uh, so it was you know shown to be unresolvable in a certain sense
3656280	3661080	But it it was asking a I don't want to say natural because a lot of these math
3661960	3666360	Questions aren't natural in the sense that most people would want but it was asking a question where you wouldn't expect that to be true
3666760	3669400	So maybe at the edges of theory there are sometimes when the
3670040	3675000	Paradoxes that are possible if they curdles and possibility theorem shows like do eke their ways in
3675640	3680120	The impression I get is no no mathematician is thinking about it. They're not actively worrying about it
3680120	3680840	It's not like oh god
3680840	3685400	No, like can I be sure that the stuff that i'm going to show us to for all the practical problems of it's like, you know
3685400	3689400	The remand hypothesis or twin primes almost everyone's like no, there's going to be an answer
3689880	3691320	like it
3691320	3697080	Maybe they turn out to be unresolvable in in one of these uh ways, but like there's just a strong sense that
3698200	3700200	That theorem came from a pathology
3701000	3702360	in a way that
3702360	3704920	Natural questions that people actually care about don't
3705640	3708440	That's really interesting that something from the outside
3709240	3715640	In and in popularizations is seems to be a very fundamental thing where people people have definitely heard about this, right?
3716040	3720680	Is not internally a good a good analogy here is in computer science the halting problem
3720760	3723240	it's like you take a computer science course one of the first things you'll learn is
3723800	3726040	you know the proof of the halting problem and
3727080	3731560	It's another one of those things where you don't really need to be able to prove that every single
3732040	3735240	Or you have that sort of program available. Yeah
3738600	3740600	No comment no more comment
3741880	3744920	Why are good explanations so hard to find?
3745480	3747480	Despite how useful they are
3747960	3749560	Obviously, there's many other other than you as well
3749560	3754040	There's many other cases of good explanations, but generally it just seems like there aren't as many as there should be
3754520	3756520	Is it just a story of economics where it's nobody's?
3757080	3760200	Incentive to be making really spend a lot of time making good explanations
3760280	3765240	Is it just a really hard skill that isn't correlated with being able to come up with a discovery itself?
3765800	3769080	What why are good explanations scarce? I think there's maybe two
3770280	3771880	explanations
3771960	3775480	The first less important one is going to be that there's a difference between
3776200	3779240	Knowing something and then remembering what it's like not to know it
3779560	3783400	And the character's difficult explanation is that you're walking someone on a path
3783800	3786760	From the feeling of not understanding up to the feeling of understanding
3787480	3790920	Earlier you were asking about societies that are that lack numeracy
3791400	3795560	That's such a hard brain state to put yourself in like what's it like to not even know numbers?
3795800	3797800	How would you start to explain what numbers are?
3798840	3801480	Maybe you should go from a bunch of concrete examples, but like
3801960	3807160	The way that you think about numbers and adding things it's just you have to really unpack a lot before you even start there
3807640	3810520	And I think at higher levels of abstraction that becomes even harder
3810840	3815320	Because it it shapes the way that you think so much that remembering what it's like not to understand it
3815800	3820600	You're teaching some kid algebra and the premise of like a variable. They're like, what is x?
3820920	3825320	You're like, well, it's it's it's not necessarily anything, but it's what we're solving for like yeah, but what is it?
3825560	3828600	Like trying to answer what is x is a weirdly hard thing because it
3829240	3831240	Is the premise that you're even starting from?
3832840	3836520	The more important one probably is that the best explanation
3836920	3842520	Depends heavily on the individual who's learning and the perfect explanation for you
3844280	3847080	Often might be very different from the perfect explanation for someone else
3847240	3850440	So there's a lot of very good domain specific explanations, you know
3851000	3856200	Pull up in any textbook and like chapter 12 of it is probably explaining the content in there like quite well
3856440	3861400	Assuming that you've read chapters one through 11, but if you're coming in from a cold start, it's a little bit hard
3861960	3867480	And so the real gold nugget is like, how do you construct explanations which are as generally?
3868200	3871000	Useful as possible as generally appealing as possible
3871800	3875480	And that I think because you can't assume shared context it becomes this challenge
3875560	3878200	and I think there's like tips and tricks along the way but
3879400	3884360	Because the people that are often making explanations have a specific enough audience
3884600	3890280	It is this classroom of 30 people or it's this discipline of majors who are in their third year
3890920	3896440	All the explanations from the people who are professional explainers in some sense are so targeted that
3897080	3899080	Maybe it's the economic thing you're talking about. There's not
3899880	3906280	Or at least until recently in history. There hasn't been the need to or the incentive to come up with something that would be
3906680	3911800	Um motivating and approachable and clear to an extremely wide variety of different backgrounds
3912360	3915400	Is the process of making your videos is that mostly you?
3916200	3917240	Okay
3917240	3921000	Given the scale you're reaching it seems that if it was possible
3922840	3927560	It would you know, just like a small increase in productivity would be worth like an entire production studio
3928040	3932200	And it's interesting to me or surprising that the transaction cost of having
3932920	3938920	A production setup are high enough that it's better to literally do the mundane details yourself
3939480	3940600	Yeah, I mean
3940600	3945080	This could honestly just be a personal flaw like i'm not good at um
3945640	3949080	Pulling people in and then I've struggled to do this effectively in the past
3949560	3956680	But a part of it is that the the seemingly mundane details are sometimes just how I even think about constructing it in the first place
3957960	3961880	You know the first thing that a lot of youtubers will do if they can hire is hire an editor
3962200	3964040	and this will be because
3964040	3967960	They film a lot of things and so a lot of the editing process is removing the stuff that was
3968360	3971560	Filmed that shouldn't be in the video and just leaving the stuff that should be in the video
3971800	3975720	And that's time consuming and it's kind of mundane and it's probably not that relevant to
3976440	3979560	What the creator should be thinking about when you're not filming stuff
3979960	3981800	Like the the editing process for me
3981880	3985160	You know I start by laying out all of the animations and stuff that I'll want in a timeline
3985400	3988920	And then once I record the voice over the actual editing is like a day
3989400	3992920	And it's not like I guess I could hire someone and gain a day back of my life
3993000	3998360	But the the communication back and forth for saying what specifically I want like all of the little cuts that I'm making along the way
3998920	4004280	Are my way of even thinking about what I want the final piece to be such that it would be hard to put it into words
4004920	4009960	It's it's similar for why I maybe find it quite hard to use like a co-pilot and some of these like
4011480	4014360	LLM tools and coding where for the animation code
4014440	4017960	You know it can be super great if you're learning some new library and it knows about that library that you don't
4018040	4022760	But for my library that I know inside it out if I'm just using it it feels like oh, this should be the most
4023480	4026120	Automatable thing ever, you know, it's it's just text
4026520	4031800	Like I should be the first youtuber who can actually do this better because the the substance behind each animation is text
4031880	4034440	It's not like an editing workflow in quite the same way
4035000	4037400	But it doesn't work and I think it's because
4038040	4038840	um
4038840	4043800	Maybe it's just because you need a multimodal thing that actually understands the look of the output like the output isn't
4044520	4048440	Something that is consumable in text. It's something about how it looks, but at a deeper level
4049080	4052120	I can't even put into words what I want to put on the screen
4052840	4057160	Except to do so in code like that's just the way that I'm thinking about it and
4058120	4063000	Like if I were to try to put into English the thing that I want as a comment that then gets expanded
4063640	4066680	That task is actually harder than writing it in in the code
4067320	4072360	And if it's clunky to write in code that's a sign that I should like change the interface of the library such that
4072360	4075000	It's less clunky to be expressive in the way that I want
4075640	4078920	And it's in that same way where a lot of the creative process
4078920	4080920	Is
4081160	4083160	That feels mundane
4083720	4088360	Those are just like the cogs of thought slowly turning in a way that if they weren't turning for that part
4088360	4094200	They would have to be turning during the interface of communication with a collaborator. Yeah on the point of working with
4094760	4096760	co-pilot uh where
4097320	4103240	We kind of visualized the changes you wanted to make there were the paper for microsoft research the sparks of hji paper
4103240	4108600	had it actually really interesting example where it was generating letek and they
4109160	4115400	You generated some output and they say change this so that the visual that comes up in the rendering is different in this way
4115800	4120760	And it was actually able to do that which was their evidence that it can understand the higher level visual abstraction
4121480	4123480	Um, so but I guess I can't do that for manum
4124120	4129960	There's a couple reasons I might um, it might not be as fair a comparison one would be the two versions of manum
4130040	4134440	There was a split where there's a community version that is you know by the community for the community
4134600	4137080	And then mine the interfaces are largely similar
4137800	4139800	The rendering engines are quite different
4140600	4142600	But because of slight differences in that
4143240	4147800	And you know it might have a tendency it learned from one or it saw examples from one and it's intermixing them
4148120	4150680	So stuff just doesn't quite run when there's discrepancy
4151240	4156840	I maybe shot myself in the foot where all of my code for videos like I don't really comment it that much because it's it's like a
4156840	4160120	One and done deal it's if it's you know, there's also a
4160840	4163640	for the core library I could comment and document a lot better, but like
4164520	4167960	The way that I'm making it feels much more like the editing flow if you were to look at the
4168680	4173800	Operation history of someone in after effects right like written down. It's a little bit more like that where
4174600	4179720	There's not a perfect description in English of the thing that I want to do and then the execution of that
4180040	4182440	It's just it's just the execution of that
4182920	4184120	um
4184120	4189560	And you know, it's it's not meant to be editable and hindsight as much because I'm just in the flow of making the scene for the one video
4190120	4190760	and
4190760	4191960	You know, maybe
4191960	4196760	I could have given it a better chance to learn what it's supposed to be happening by having a really
4197320	4201800	Well-documented set of like this is the input. This is the output. This is the comment describing it in English
4202360	4207640	But even then that wouldn't hit the problem on like I would have to articulate what the thing I want is in the first place
4208280	4212760	And the the language the program language is just the right mode of articulation in the first place
4213320	4217560	This is something I wanted to I was really curious about ever since I learned about it
4218040	4223480	I watched many of the summer of math exploration prize videos
4224120	4230360	And it was shocking to me how good that I mean these looked like entire production studios were dedicated to making them
4230680	4234600	Many of them and it was shocking to me that you could motivate and elicit
4235160	4237160	This quality of contribution
4237320	4242040	Given the relatively modest prize pool, which I was like five winners $1,000 each
4242280	4243640	um
4243640	4249480	What is your explanation of just running prizes like this? Why you were able to get such high quality contributions?
4250280	4254280	Is it is it is a prize pool even relevant? Is it just about your reputation and reach?
4254680	4256600	I do wonder how relevant the prize pool is
4256680	4260200	I mean we've been thinking about this because you know, we did it first in 2021
4260200	4262360	then we plan to continue doing it annually and
4263160	4264680	I probably if I like
4264680	4269400	Was a mover and a shaker could raise much more if I wanted to like get a big prize pool there
4269720	4275320	I don't think it would change the quality of the content because the impression I get is that people aren't fundamentally motivated by
4275720	4277400	Like winning some cash prize
4277400	4278280	certainly
4278280	4279640	They're not
4279640	4284840	Investing with a like expected value calculation on what if they are that's a terrible terrible plan
4285000	4289880	And if anything like that might be a problem like let's say it was $100,000 prize for each of the winners
4290280	4297160	Then it would be a real problem where someone who and you know people do like to illusionally think that they're very likely going to be the winner
4298120	4303080	They might like actually pour a lot of their own resources into it with the expectation of gaining it and then
4303800	4308120	That's just a messy situation. I don't want to be in with like why wasn't mine chosen as a winner because
4308760	4310760	The whole event is not supposed to be about
4311560	4312920	winners in fact
4312920	4316280	Maybe for listeners who don't know I should describe what you're talking about
4316760	4318520	The summer of math exposition
4318520	4321960	Actually, the the history is a little bit funny because it started with an intern application
4322360	4324520	Where I in 2021 wanted to have
4325480	4329560	Just like a couple interns to do a certain thing on my website basically and
4330360	4333960	I put out a call for people to apply
4334360	4337720	I got 2500 applicants and somewhere in the application
4337720	4341080	I mentioned that during the summer in addition to like the main task I wanted them to do
4341800	4345400	You know, I'd give freedom if they just wanted to do something relevant to math exposition online
4345480	4346680	That was their own thing
4346680	4348200	I'd be happy to provide
4348200	4353000	You know some mentorship or just give them the freedom to do that one day a week and give me a little pitch on what your
4353160	4357240	What your idea would be and as I went through, you know, all of the applications
4358040	4360040	Which is a lot. Um, I
4361000	4365000	Felt so bad because so often the person would have a little pitch and like what they would want to make
4365240	4367240	And in my mind, I'd think cool
4367240	4372440	You should make that you don't need me to like do that like just spend your summer making that why not?
4373000	4377000	And people were clearly inspired by the thought of adding something and like I said earlier
4377800	4379800	Being a youtuber is the most common
4380280	4383080	Like job aspiration among the youth these days
4384120	4385240	and so
4385240	4387560	Is a consolation of sorts to those
4388280	4392200	99% that I had to reject for the internship. I said, oh, but what we will do
4393080	4397640	We're just gonna like host this thing. We'll call it the summer of math exposition where we'll give you a deadline
4398680	4401640	I'll like promise to feature some people in a video
4402120	4404280	maybe I'll choose five of them to do that and
4404920	4409320	If you feel like the thing that you were going to do like with me as your 20 project as an intern is something
4409320	4413720	You're excited about make it a hundred percent project or 20 percent or whatever whatever freedom you have
4413720	4418760	just do it anyway and like I can give you this little carrot in the form of featuring it in a video and
4419480	4426040	Give you a deadline which let's be honest is what actually makes the difference between people doing something and procrastinating on it sometimes
4427320	4433160	Later there was I think it was brilliant that year said they would be happy to put some cash prizes in so I said sure. Why not?
4433560	4435560	I don't think the cash prize
4435640	4441080	Is super important, but it's nice. I mean it shows that someone actually cared and put some real thought into
4441560	4443960	Doing something that wasn't just a made-up gold star
4444040	4448200	But they put some material behind saying that you were selected as a winner of this thing
4448840	4451480	But all in all it was never supposed to be about choosing winners
4451480	4454920	It was just get more people to make stuff and if anything I'd actually
4455800	4462200	I love it when I see stuff from existing educators and teachers where it's maybe not the youth who want to be youtubers
4462680	4468120	Pouring their hearts and souls into it, but it's the educator who built up a lot of intuition over the course of their career
4468120	4471880	For what constitutes a clear explanation and they're just sharing it more broadly
4472520	4473640	so
4473640	4475080	to your question on
4475080	4479800	What is it that caused there to be such high production quality in some of the entries there
4480840	4487480	Part of the answer might just be that like tooling is so good now that individuals can actually make pretty incredible things sometimes
4488040	4492440	I misphrase if I said production quality. I might just meant the whole composition as a whole
4492920	4495640	Yeah, well, there's a there's a selection filter too, right?
4495640	4498760	Like there were in that first year 1,200 submissions
4498920	4502200	I featured in you know the winning video five of them. So
4502840	4506120	Of course, they're going they're necessarily
4507080	4508920	Unrepresentative of the norm
4508920	4511240	By the very nature of who I was choosing to feature
4511320	4515480	But the fact that those were even in the pool something that high quality was even in the pool
4515960	4519720	I think it hits a little bit to your miracle year point where I think
4519960	4526120	What might be happening is you have people with a ton of potential energy for something that they've kind of been thinking about making for a
4526120	4527160	long time
4527160	4532120	And the hope was to give people a little push. Here's a deadline. Here's a little prize
4532280	4535320	Here's a promise that maybe if you make it it won't just go into the void
4535480	4537960	But there's a chance that it could it gets exposed to more people
4538200	4543640	Which I think is absolutely played out and not for the reason that someone might expect where I choose winners
4543640	4545640	And I feature those winners and people watch them
4546120	4548280	a huge amount of viewership happens
4549400	4552280	Before I even begin the process of looking at them
4552920	4557480	And this was an accident too where in this first year we got 1,200 submissions
4557800	4562440	I said expect judges who are reviewing it to spend at most 10 minutes on each piece
4562440	4566200	So it could be longer, but like don't rely on someone watching it for more
4566600	4569880	But realistically when I'm reviewing something I want to watch the whole piece. Um
4570600	4572600	I absolutely do not have time to watch
4574600	4580360	It takes I've learned it takes me about two weeks of just full-time work to like watch a hundred of these
4581000	4583000	pieces and give the kind of feedback that I want
4584360	4586120	and to
4586120	4589320	To manage that problem of more than we could manually review
4589720	4595960	We put together this peer review system that would basically have an algorithm feed people pairs of videos
4595960	4598520	And they would just say which one is better and then it would feed them another one
4598920	4604040	And in the first two years we we just used a tool that was common for hackathons that did this
4604600	4608920	And what that did is one it gave us a partially ordered list of
4610120	4613720	Content by quality loosely. We didn't need it to be perfect
4613720	4620760	We just needed there to be a very high chance that the five most deserving videos were visible somewhere in that top 100, right?
4621080	4623080	So there the algorithm doesn't have to be perfect
4623640	4625800	but what happened I think is that
4626760	4630280	By having this period when a ton of people are watching the same batch of videos
4631160	4634840	So a thing I've learned about the youtube algorithm is in theory
4634840	4637160	You would want to just use machine learning for everything, right?
4637240	4639800	Like you have some massive neural network where on the input of it
4639960	4645400	It's got five billion videos or however many exist and the output it decides what seven are best to recommend to you
4645720	4649800	That is completely computationally infeasible, right? I also
4650760	4652760	Think I think this is all public knowledge
4653640	4657640	But so what you have to do instead is use some sort of proxies
4658120	4663000	As a first pass to nominate a video to even be fed into the machine learning driven algorithm
4663240	4667800	So that you're only feeding in like a thousand or so or something in the order of thousands like nominees
4668280	4669880	so the real
4669880	4674680	Difference that it can make if you've made a really good video between it getting to the people who would like it
4675000	4679240	And not getting there. It's not the flaws in the algorithm. The algorithm is probably quite good
4679640	4685160	It's the mismatch between the proxies being used to nominate stuff to see whether it's even in the running
4685640	4688280	So one of the things used for nomination is
4689000	4695320	Understanding the co-watch graph where if you've watched video a and you've also watched video b and then I watch video a
4696040	4698920	Your watching both of those gives a little link between them
4699000	4702120	Or maybe you and a ton of other people watching both of them gives a little link between
4702440	4704440	such that once I watch video a
4704680	4707880	b is potentially nominated in that phase because
4708600	4710600	You know, it's recognized that there's a lot of co-watching
4710920	4713960	That's something that I'm sure still is like quite challenging at scale
4714040	4717160	But it's more plausible to do at scale than like running some massive neural network
4717640	4724200	And so I think what might have happened is that by having a bunch of co-watching happening on this same pool of videos
4724680	4729400	All you need is for like some of them to have decent reach and get recommended, right?
4729640	4731240	Because then that kicks off
4731240	4737400	It's like igniting a pile of kindling where then if others are good if they're going to give people good experiences
4737880	4743080	They get not only nominated but then recommended which then like kicks back in the feedback loop there
4743800	4744840	so
4744840	4746840	That turns out to be
4747160	4752520	I think as close to a guarantee as you can get of saying if you make something that's good
4752920	4755560	It's a good piece that will satisfy someone
4756120	4760200	They come away feeling like they learned something that they otherwise didn't know and it was well presented
4761160	4766920	If you can get it into this peer review process, it will reach people. It's not just going to be shouting into the void
4767800	4769800	And and in this case, you know, there was last year
4769960	4774440	I think over 100 videos where after the first two weeks they had more than 10,000 views
4774680	4778760	Which I know in the grand scheme people think like huge numbers of views and millions out there, but like for a
4779320	4781320	for a fresh channel
4781320	4786520	Talking about a niche mathematical topic to be able to put it out and like get 10,000 people to watch it
4786600	4791400	I think is amazing, right and the idea that that could happen for over 100 people. I think is amazing
4791800	4792840	so
4792840	4796520	That had nothing to do with the prize pool, right in in that
4797480	4798840	the
4798840	4803800	The motive might have been a hope of like actually getting some reach and having some sense of a guarantee of there being some reach
4804760	4810040	Ironically the reason to do the whole peer review system in the first place is in the service of selecting winners
4810040	4813160	And so like without something in the service of selecting winners
4813160	4818280	If you just said hey, we're having a watch fest where everyone watches each other's things somehow it wouldn't quite have the same like
4819160	4821080	I don't know poll that gets people into it
4821240	4824680	So I think it still makes sense to have winners and to have some material behind those winners
4825400	4828920	It doesn't have to be much though. And if anything, I think it might ruin it to make it too much
4829400	4835080	I'll also say it's $15,000 actually because we will give $500 to 20 different honorable mentions
4835800	4837080	at least this year
4837080	4838360	so
4838360	4840280	Still pretty modest in the scheme
4840280	4843880	There's like how much money you can invest to try to get more math lessons in the world
4844440	4849000	I watch many of the honorable mentions as well because they were just topics that are interesting to me and
4850200	4850840	I mean
4850840	4855880	It's like the thing that the president of chicago university said at one point where he said we could discard the people
4855880	4860280	We admitted and select the next thousand for our class and there would be no difference. It was that level of
4861560	4865960	You know your yeah, that level of peak. Yeah, and I really admire by the way
4866600	4869880	Not only the education that you're provided directly with your videos
4869880	4871000	Which have reached millions of people
4871000	4874920	But the fact that you're also setting up this way of getting more people to contribute
4875240	4877800	And maybe get to topics that you wouldn't have time to get to yourself
4877800	4879880	So I like I really admire that you're doing that
4880600	4882600	If you're self teaching yourself a field
4883000	4886920	That involves mathematics. Let's say it's physics or some other thing like that
4888040	4894520	There's problems where you have to understand. How do I put this in terms of a dirt of an integral?
4895000	4898920	and from there it's can I solve this integral and
4900440	4903560	What would you recommend to somebody who is teaching themselves?
4903960	4907720	Let's say quantum mechanics and they I figured out how to put how to get the right
4908200	4912840	Mathematical equation here. Is it important for their understanding to be able to take go from there to
4913560	4917720	Getting it to the end result or can they just say well, I can just abstract that out. I understand the broader
4919000	4921240	Way to set up the problem in terms of the physics itself
4921800	4928920	I think where a lot of self learners shoot themselves in the foot is by skipping calculations by by thinking that that's
4930200	4932360	incidental to the core understanding
4932760	4938440	But actually you I think you do build a lot of intuition just by putting in the reps of certain calculations
4939640	4944840	Some of them maybe turn out not to be all that important and in that case. Okay, so be it but sometimes
4945720	4948360	that's what maybe shapes your sense of
4949240	4951960	Where the substance of a result really came from
4952680	4953880	I don't know it might be something you realize
4953880	4959080	Oh, it's because of the square root that you get this decay and if you didn't like really go through the exercise
4959160	4962280	You would just instead coming away thinking like such and such decays
4962280	4966440	But with other circumstances it doesn't decay and like not really understanding what was
4967000	4972600	The core part of this, you know high level result. That is the thing you actually want to come out remembering
4973480	4977080	Like putting in the work with the calculations is where you solidify all of those
4977720	4979400	underlying intuitions
4979400	4981720	And without the forcing function of homework
4982840	4984840	People we just like don't do it
4984920	4990280	So that I think that's one thing that I learned is a big difference post college versus during college
4991240	4995800	Is like post college. It's very easy in learning stuff to just accidentally skip that and then
4996920	4998440	It doesn't sink in as well
4998440	5004920	So I think when you're reading something having a notebook next to you just like having pen and paper pencil and paper whatever it is
5005640	5007960	Should be considered part of the actual reading process
5008360	5012200	And if you are relying too much on like reading and kind of looking up and thinking in your head
5013000	5018280	You know, maybe that's going to get something but it's it's not going to be as highly leveraged as it could be
5018680	5025000	What will be the what would be the impact of more self teaching in terms of what kinds of personalities benefit most?
5025400	5026360	so
5026360	5029400	There's obviously a difference in the kind of person who benefits most
5030120	5034600	In a situation where there's it's a college course and everybody has to do the homework, but maybe some people are better
5035880	5038760	tuned for the kind of work that's placed there versus
5039560	5043560	All this stuff is available for you on youtube and then textbooks for exercises and so on
5043640	5046760	But you have to have the conscientiousness to actually go ahead and pursue it
5047880	5049880	I mean, how do you see the
5049960	5055080	Distribution of who will benefit from the more modern way in which you can get whatever you want
5055320	5057320	But you have to push yourself to get it
5057400	5062200	There's a really good book that's actually kind of relevant to some of your early questions called failure to disrupt
5062360	5065080	That goes over the history of educational technology
5065640	5070680	Trying to answer the question you have these repeated cycles of people saying such and such technology that
5071640	5074120	Almost always is getting more explanations to more people
5074840	5079800	Promises that it'll disrupt the existing university system or disrupt the existing school system and just kind of never does
5080520	5083320	You know, one of the things that it highlights is how stratifying
5084040	5087400	These technologies will be in that they actually are very very good
5087880	5092520	for those who are already motivated or kind of already on the top in some way and
5093240	5094520	They end up
5094520	5096040	Struggling the most
5096040	5098040	Just for those who are performing more poorly
5098280	5104120	And maybe it's because of confounding causation where the same thing that causes someone to not do poorly in the traditional system
5104120	5108040	Also means that they're not going to engage as well with the the plethora of tools available
5109000	5114120	I don't know if this answers your question, but I would reemphasize that what's probably most important
5114920	5119800	To getting people to actually learn something is not the explanation or the quality of explanations available
5119880	5122360	Because since the printing press that has been
5123560	5127560	Not not literally true because maybe access to libraries and such as as universal as you would want
5127800	5131560	But like people had access to the explanation once they were motivated
5132040	5133480	but instead
5133480	5136120	It's going to be the social factors like are the are the
5136680	5141880	Five best friends that you have also interested in the stuff and do they tend to push you up or they tend to pull you down
5141880	5147640	When it comes to learning more things or do you ever a reason to there's a job that you want to get or domain that you want
5147640	5152120	To enter where you just have to understand something is there a personal project that you're doing like
5152920	5156840	the existence of compelling personal projects and
5158200	5165720	Encouraging friend groups probably does way way more than the average quality of explanation online ever could
5166280	5170520	Because once you get someone motivated one, they're just they're going to learn it
5170920	5174520	It maybe makes it a more fluid process if there's good explanations versus bad ones
5174600	5177480	And it keeps you from having some people drop out of that process
5177800	5179000	Which is important
5179000	5181400	But if you're not motivating them into it in the first place
5181880	5187640	It doesn't matter if you have the you know most world-class explanations on every possible topic out there
5188360	5191320	It's uh, it's it's screaming into a void effectively
5191960	5196360	And I don't I don't know the best way to get more people to um no things I I have had a thought
5197000	5199400	This this is the kind of thing that could never be done in practice
5199480	5202120	But instead it's something you would like write some kind of novel about
5202600	5204600	Where if you want the perfect school
5204680	5209320	Right something where you can insert some students and then you want them to get the best education that you can
5210040	5211560	what you need to do
5211560	5215720	Is let's say it's a high school you insert a lot of like
5217160	5223560	Really attractive high schooler plants as actors that you like get the students to develop crushes
5223880	5229640	On the various plants right and then anything that you want to learn the plant has to express a certain interest in it
5229640	5235320	They're like oh, they're really interested in Charles Dickens or something right and they express this interest and then they
5235640	5240200	You know suggest that they would become more interested in whoever your target student is if they
5240680	5244040	Also read the dickens with them. They're also were like interested in learning the physics
5244440	5247800	Like if you get that in a way, you know, you socially engineer this setting
5248520	5255640	The effectiveness that that would have to get students to actually learn stuff is probably so many miles above anything else that we
5255640	5259960	Could do that nothing like that in practice could ever actually literally work
5260200	5263080	But at least viewing that as this end point of okay
5263560	5266920	This mode of interaction would be hyper effective at education
5267320	5272600	Is there anything that kind of gets at that right and so okay the kind of things that get at that it would be
5274120	5279800	Being cognizant of your child's peer group or something which is think something that parents. I think very naturally do or
5280520	5283720	Okay, it doesn't have to be a romantic crush, but it could be that there's
5284280	5285880	There's respect for the teacher, right?
5285880	5289000	It's someone that they genuinely respect and look up to such that when they say
5289400	5293880	There's an an edification to come from read reading dickens that that actually lands in a way
5295080	5296840	and so
5296840	5299880	Taking that as a paragon and then letting everything else approximate that
5301000	5307160	Has I would emphasize nothing to do with the quality of online explanations that there are out there
5307480	5313720	That at best just makes it such that you know, you can you can lubricate the process once someone's sufficiently interested
5313880	5315880	You found a new replica use case
5315880	5317880	yes, I mean
5317880	5319880	I'm not saying we should do it, but
5320840	5322840	Think of how effective that would be
5323080	5326280	Uh, okay final question. This is something I should have followed up on earlier
5326680	5330280	But your plans to become a high school teacher for some amount of years
5330840	5334360	When you're planning on doing that and what do you hope to get out of that? I would say no concrete plans
5334440	5339560	I would say it would I wouldn't want to do it in a period where like I also have young children
5340760	5343000	And therefore it would make sense to like
5343960	5345720	Maybe a lot of people will say this kind of thing
5345720	5350360	But there's friends of mine who think when their child is in like, um, you know high school
5350360	5352200	That's that's when they would want to be a high school teacher
5352600	5354760	I think two two things I would want to get out of it one of them
5355480	5361240	As I was emphasizing I think you just lose touch with what it's like not to know stuff or what it's like to be a student
5361560	5367960	And so maintaining that kind of connection so that I don't become dollar and dollar over time feels important the other
5368920	5370920	I would like to
5372040	5377640	Live in a world where more people who are savvy with STEM spend some of their time teaching
5377960	5383320	Um, I just think that's one of the highest leverage ways that you can think of to actually get more people to engage with math
5384040	5386040	And so I would like to
5386040	5388840	Encourage people to do that and call that call to action
5389800	5390920	Um
5390920	5394760	Some some notion of spending maybe not your whole career, but a little bit of time
5395400	5399160	In teaching there's not as fluid a system for doing that as say
5399640	5404440	You know going through a tour of service in certain certain countries where everyone like spends two years in the military
5404920	5407320	So shy of having a system like that for education
5407400	5410120	There's all these kind of ad hoc things where you know
5410120	5414520	Charter schools might have like an emergency credential system to like get a science teacher in
5414920	5417800	Um, but there's a you know teach for america is something out there
5417800	5424120	there's enough ways that someone could spend a little bit of time that's probably not fully saturated at this point that
5424440	5427160	You know the world would be better if more people did that and
5428040	5432760	It would be hypocritical for me to suggest that and then not to actually put my uh, but my
5433400	5435400	Feet where my words are
5435720	5440600	Yeah, well, uh, I think that's a great note to leave it on grant. Um, thanks so much for coming on the podcast
5440680	5444920	And genuinely, I mean you you're one of the people I really really admire but what you've done for the
5445880	5449080	The landscape of math education is it mean it's really remarkable. So
5449800	5452280	This is a pleasure to talk to you. Thanks for saying that I had a lot of fun
5453880	5456280	Hey everybody, I hope you enjoyed that episode
