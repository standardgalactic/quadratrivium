0	3040	I challenge the claim that next token prediction cannot
3040	8560	surpass human performance. It looks like on the surface, it
8560	11920	cannot. It looks on the surface, if you just learn to
11920	16320	imitate, to predict what people do, it means that you can only
16320	20240	copy people. But there here is a counter argument for why it
20240	24240	might not be quite so if your neural net is, if your base
24240	27520	neural net is smart enough, you just ask it like, what would
27600	31200	what would a person with like great insight and wisdom and
31200	35200	capability do? Maybe such a person doesn't exist. But there's
35200	37520	a pretty good chance that the neural net will be able to
37600	41840	extrapolate how such a person would behave. Do you see what I
41840	42160	mean?
42320	44640	Yes, although where would it get the sort of insight about
44640	48240	what that's a person would do, if not from from the data of
48240	50240	regular people? Because like, if you think about it, what does
50240	54160	it mean to predict the next token well enough? What does it
54160	56160	mean? Actually, it's actually it's a much it's a deeper
56160	59280	question than it seems. Predicting the next token well
59280	67120	means that you understand the underlying reality that led to
67120	71840	the creation of that token. It's not statistics like it is
71840	76080	statistics, but what is statistics? In order to on to
76080	78720	understand those statistics to compress them, you need to
78720	83200	understand what is it about the world that creates this those
83200	86080	statistics. And so then you say, Okay, well, I have all those
86080	88640	people. What is it about people that creates their behaviors?
88720	91520	Well, they have, you know, they have thoughts and they have
91520	94080	feelings and they have ideas and they do things in certain
94080	98720	ways. All of those would be deduced from next token
98720	103360	prediction. And I'd argue that this should make it possible,
103440	107200	not indefinitely, but to a to a pretty decent degree to say
107200	110080	well, can you guess what you what you do if you took a person
110080	112800	with like this characteristic and that characteristic, like
112800	116560	such a person doesn't exist. But because you're so good at
116560	118720	predicting the next token, you should still be able to guess
118720	123280	what that person would do this hypothetical imaginary person
123280	128960	means far greater mental ability than the rest of us.
