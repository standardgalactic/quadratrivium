0	6600	This is a fun book to read because then you just mentioned in there what the original source is to read to you know
6600	12440	It's like it's like the herald bloom of economics, right? You just like it's a book written for smart people
13640	16600	Okay, so let's just jump into it. Okay, the book we're talking about is
17520	22540	Goat who is the greatest economist of all time and why doesn't matter? All right, let's start with Keynes
22880	24880	So in the section in Keynes
25720	29820	You quote him. I think talking about Robert Marshall. He says
30000	32360	Alfred Marshall. Oh, sorry Alfred Marshall. He says
33400	38240	The master economist must possess a rare combination of gifts. He must be a mathematician
38680	43040	historian statesman philosopher no part of man's nature
43560	50360	Man's nature or his institutions must lie entirely outside his regard and you say well Keynes is obviously talking about himself
50640	55880	Because he was all those things and he was arguably the only person who was all those things at the time
55880	58360	He must have known that. Okay. Well, you know what I'm gonna ask now
60760	64880	So what should we make of Tyler Cowan citing Keynes?
65840	70560	Using this quote a quote that's also applies to Tyler Cowan. I don't think it applies to me
71080	73680	What's the exact list again? Am I a statesman?
74240	79160	Did I sure you're late at the Treaty of Versailles or something comparable? I don't know we're in Washington
79160	81160	I'm sure you talk to all the people who matter quite a bit
81800	84840	Well, I guess I'm more of a statesman than most economists
84840	90480	But I don't come close to Keynes in the breadth of his high-level achievement in each of those areas
91080	97840	Hmm. Okay, let's talk about them those achievements. So chapter 12 in general theory of interest employment and money
98480	104840	Here's a quote. It is probable that the actual average result of investments even during periods of progress and prosperity
105200	107520	Have disappointed the hopes which promoted them
108120	110640	If human nature felt no temptation to take a chance
110640	115680	No satisfaction profit-apart in constructing a factory a railway a mine or a farm
115960	119840	There might not be much investment merely as a result of cold calculation
120000	123480	Now it's a fascinating idea that investment is irrational
123800	126000	Or most investment throughout history has been irrational
126000	132160	But when we think today about the fact that active investing exists, you know for winners curse like reasons
132160	135440	VCs probably make on average less returns than the market
136360	139120	There's a whole bunch of different examples you can go through right M&A
139840	145440	Usually doesn't achieve this energy is it expects throughout history has more most investment been selfish to your rational
145800	149240	Well, Adam Smith was the first one. I know to have made this point that
150280	153240	Projectors, I think he called them are overly optimistic
153680	159840	So people who do startups are overly optimistic people who have well-entrenched VC franchises
160040	164680	Make a lot of money and there's some kind of bifurcation in the distribution, right?
164680	169360	Then there's a lot of others who are just playing at it and maybe hoping to break even
170520	171760	so
171760	176120	The rate of return on private investment if you include small businesses
176520	178520	it's highly skewed and
178680	184280	Just a few percent of the people doing this make anything at all. So there's a lot to what Cain said
184280	188080	I don't think he described it adequately in terms of a probability distribution
188680	193080	But then again, he probably didn't have the data, but I wouldn't reject it out of hand. Hmm
193320	195320	Another example here is
195440	202760	This is something your colleague Alex Tobrock talks about a lot is that innovators don't internalize most of the gains you get to society
202760	207320	So here's another example where you know, the entrepreneur compared to one of his first employees
207320	210120	Is he that much better off for taking the extra risk and working that much harder?
211000	213000	What does this tell us about?
213320	218320	Is it it's a marvelous insight that you know, we're actually more of a seeking than it's selfishly
219280	224240	Selfishly good for us. That was Reuven Brenner's claim in some of his books on risk
224480	228080	Again, I think you have to distinguish between different parts of the distribution
228400	233120	So it seems there's a very large number of people who foolishly start small businesses
233440	239600	Maybe they overly value autonomy when they ought to just get a job with a relatively stable company
240400	242400	So they're part of the thesis is correct
242800	248000	And I doubt if there's really big social returns to whatever those people do even if they could make a go of it
249040	251040	But there's another part of the distribution
251280	258560	People who are actually innovating or have realistic prospects of doing so where I do think those social returns are very high
258960	260960	Now that 2 figure
261120	265120	That cited a lot. I don't think it's really based in much real
265760	268320	It's maybe not a crazy seed of the pants estimate
268560	274000	But people think like oh, we know it's two percent and we really don't so you look at Picasso, right? He
274880	277920	Helped generate cubism with Brock and some other artists
278720	281200	How good is our estimate of Picasso's income?
281680	287680	Compared to the spin-offs from Picasso. We just don't really know, right? We don't know it's two percent
287840	290320	It could be one percent. It could be six percent
291200	297280	How different do you think it is in art versus, uh, I don't know entrepreneurship versus different kinds of entrepreneurship
297280	301120	There's different industries there as well, right? I'm not sure it's that different
301760	305360	So say if some people start blogging a lot of people copy them, right?
305520	309120	Well, some people start painting in a particular style a lot of people copy them
309360	312560	I'm not saying the numbers are the same, but they don't sound like
313440	317760	Issues that in principle are so different into two percent overestimate or underestimate. It might be wrong
317920	319520	But in which way is it wrong?
319520	323360	My seed of the pants estimate would be two to five percent. So I think it's pretty close
323600	327760	But again, that's not based on anything firm. Here's another quote from Keynes
327760	335200	Uh, investment based on genuine long-term expectation is so difficult as to be scarcely practicable
335680	342240	He who attempts it must surely lead much more laborious days and run greater risk than he who tries to guess better than the crowd
342640	344640	How the crowd will behave?
345440	349840	Is so one way to look at this is like, oh, he just doesn't understand, uh, efficient market hypothesis
350080	352080	It's like before random walks or something
352080	353520	but, uh,
353520	356160	There's things you can see in the market today where, uh, you know
356960	361760	Are the prospects for future dividends so much higher after cover than they were immediately after the crash
362400	367840	Um, how much a market behavior can be explained by these sorts of uh claims from Keynes?
368400	371360	I think Keynes had the view that for his time
371680	375120	You could be a short run speculator and in fact beat the markets
375680	377680	And he believed that he did so
378080	383120	And at least he did for some periods of his life that may have been luck or maybe he did have special insight
384080	390480	It probably wasn't true in general that we don't really know did efficient markets hold during, you know, Britain at that time
390720	394320	Maybe there just were profit opportunities for smarter than average people
395440	401360	Uh, so that's a view. I'm inclined not to believe it, but again, I don't think it's absurd
402240	409120	Keynes is saying for people who want money, this is biased toward the short term. You can get your profits and get out
409680	414720	And that's damaging long-term investment, which in fact he wanted to socialize
415200	417920	So he's being led to a very bad place by the argument
418400	420640	But again, we shouldn't dismiss it out of hand
421440	427920	Why is it not easy to retrospectively study what uh, how efficient markets were back then in the same way we can study it now in terms of like
428000	434960	Oh, you look at um, uh, the price earnings ratios and then what were the dividends afterwards over the coming decades for those companies
435360	441120	Based on their stock price or something. I don't know. Uh, how many publicly traded firms there were in Britain at that time
441600	444560	I don't know how good the data are things like bid asks spread
445120	450480	At what price you actually executed trades can really matter for testing efficient markets hypothesis
451600	458480	So uh, probably we can't tell even though there must be share price data of some sort at what frequency
459280	461280	Well, is it once a day? Is it once a week?
462240	466160	We don't have the sort of data we have now where you can just test anything you want
467280	471680	He also made a interesting point is like not only is it not profitable, but even if you succeed
472720	476400	Um, society will look at the contrarian in a very negative light
476960	480000	Uh, you will be like doubly punished for being a contrarian
480320	485520	But that doesn't seem to be the case right like if somebody like Warren Buffett or Charlie Munger people who do be the market are actually pretty revered
485840	487840	They're not punished in public opinion
487840	490400	And they pursued mostly long-term strategies, right?
490800	496800	But again trying to make sense of Keynes if you think about long-term investing and I don't think he meant Buffett style investing
496960	503680	I think he meant building factories trying to figure out what people would want to buy 25 years from that point in time
504400	508080	Uh, that probably was much harder than today. So you had
508800	510800	Way less access to data
511040	515760	Your ability to build an international supply chain was much weaker
516560	522560	Uh geopolitical turmoil at various points in time was much higher. So again, it's not a crazy view
522880	525600	I think there's a lot in Keynes that's very much of his time
526400	531680	That he presents out of a kind of overconfidence as being general and it's not general it may not even be true
532480	537120	But there were some reasons why you could believe it. Hmm another quote from Keynes
537680	539760	Uh, I guess I won't read the whole quote in full
539760	544800	But basically he says over time as investments go or markets get more mature more and more
544960	551200	Of equities are held basically by passive investors people who don't have a direct hand in the involvement of the enterprise
551600	555040	Um, and you know the the the share of the market that's passive investment now is much bigger
555120	560800	Should we be worried about this as long as at the margin people can do things? I'm not very worried about it
560880	565440	So there's two different kinds of worries. One is that no one monitors the value of companies
566400	570640	It seems to me those incentives aren't weaker. There's more research than ever before
571120	574000	There's maybe a problem not enough companies are publicly held
574560	579120	But you can always if you know something the rest of the market doesn't buy or sell shore and do better
579760	585760	The other worry is those passive investors have economies of scale and they'll end up colluding with each other
586320	592560	And you'll have say like three to five mutual funds private equity firms owning a big chunk of the market portfolio
593120	594480	And in essence
594480	599040	Directly or indirectly they'll tell those firms not to compete. It's a weird form of collusion
599680	602720	They don't issue explicit instructions like say the same
603360	605360	Few mutual funds own coke and Pepsi
606240	613600	Should coke and Pepsi compete or should they collude? Well, they might just pick lazier managers who in some way give you implicit collusion
614720	616720	Maybe this is another example of the
616880	621600	Innovators being unable to internalize their gains as an active investors who are providing this information to the market
621840	626080	You know, they don't make out that much better than the passive investors, but they're actually providing a valuable service
626560	629200	Uh, but this the benefits are diffused throughout throughout society
629440	631600	I think overconfidence helps us on that front
631600	634960	So there's quote unquote too much trading from a private point of view
635440	641840	But from a social point of view, maybe you can only have too much trading or too little trading and you might rather have too much trading
642240	645520	I explain that why why is there why can't it only be too much or too little?
646160	650080	Well, let's say the relevant choice variable is investor temperament
650560	656640	So yes, you'd prefer it if everyone had the temperament just to do what was socially optimal, but if temperament is some
658160	663360	This inclination in you and you can just be overconfident or not confident enough
664000	666160	And overconfidence gives you too much trading
666640	670240	That might be the best we can do again fine-tuning would be best of all
670720	675360	But i've never seen humans where you could just fine-tune all their emotions to the point where they ought to be
675920	681520	Yeah, okay, so we can ask the question. How far above optimal are we or if we are above optimal?
681840	685280	Uh in the chapter kane says that over time as markets get more mature
685360	691040	They become more speculative and the example he gives us like the new york market seems more speculative to him than the london market at a time
691600	694160	Um, but today finance is eight percent of gdp
694720	697200	Uh, is that what we should expect it to be?
697600	701920	To uh to efficiently allocate capital. Is there some reason we can just look at that number?
701920	708720	And we can actually say that that's too big. I think the relevant number for the financial sector is what percentage it is of wealth not gdp
709920	710880	So
710880	715360	You're managing wealth and the financial sector has been a pretty constant two percent of wealth
715840	722160	For a few decades in the united states with bumps. Obviously 2008 matters, but it's more or less two percent
722560	728240	And that makes it sound a lot less sinister. It's not actually like growing at the expense of something and eating up the economy
728960	730480	so
730480	735520	You you would prefer it's less than two percent, right? But two percent does not sound outrageously high to me
736560	739920	And if the ratio of wealth to gdp grows over time
740240	743760	Which it tends to do when you have durable capital and no major wars
744320	749600	Uh, the financial sector will grow relative to gdp. But again, that's not sinister think of it in terms of wealth
749920	753840	I see so one way to think about it is like the the management cost as a fraction of the
754240	758960	Assets under management or something and that's right. Yeah, that's two percent of that bad. Yeah, okay, interesting
759600	763200	I want to go back to the the risk aversion thing again because I don't know how to think about this
763200	768000	So, you know, his whole thing is these animal spirits. They guide us to make all these bets and
768640	770640	engage in all this activity
770640	772640	in some sense it's he's saying like
773360	776080	Not only are we not risk neutral, but we're more risk seeking than is
776720	778880	than is rational whereas
779600	783520	The the way you'd conventionally think about it is that humans are risk averse, right? They they have
784160	786480	They prefer to take less risk than is rational in some sense
786720	788720	Um, how do we score this?
789120	792240	Well, here Milton Friedman and other goat contender comes into the picture
792480	794480	So his famous piece with savage
794800	796800	Makes the point that risk aversion
797040	802800	Is essentially context dependent. So he was a behavioral economist before we knew of such things
803360	808880	So the same people typically will buy insurance and gamble gambling you can interpret quite broadly
809600	814080	And that's the right way to think about it. So just flat out risk aversion or risk-loving behavior
814240	821040	It doesn't really exist almost everyone is context dependent now why you choose the context you do
821680	824320	Maybe it's some kind of exercise in mood management
824720	828800	So you ensure your house so you can sleep well at night you fire insurance
829200	834480	But then you get a little bored and to stimulate yourself you're you're betting on these nba games
834720	837040	And yes, that's foolish, but it keeps you busy
837520	840960	And it helps you follow analytics and you read about the games online
841520	845680	And maybe that's efficient mood management and that's the way to think about risk behavior
846480	848480	I don't bet by the way
848480	851760	I mean you could say I bet with my career, but I don't bet on things
852000	854480	Well, what is the way and what's your version of the water shake it?
854480	860080	What is the thing where you just for the entertainment value or the distraction value you you take more risk than
860800	862800	Then would seem rational
863200	865200	Well, like writing the book goat
865680	869520	Which is not with any known publisher. It's just online. It's free
870080	872080	It's published within gpt for
873040	875040	Took me quite a while to write the book
876160	881040	I'm not sure there's a huge downside, but it's risky in the sense of it's not what anyone else was doing
881200	885760	So that was a kind of risk. I invested a lot of my writing time in something weird
886320	888640	And I've done things like that pretty frequently
889040	895200	So that keeps me you could say excited or like starting mru, you know the online education videos and economics
896000	900000	No pecuniary return to me at all indirectly. It costs me a lot of money
900880	906480	That's a sort of risk. I feel it's paid off for me in a big way, but
907280	910880	On one hand you could say well tyler, what do you actually have from that and the answer is nothing?
911600	913920	Yeah, well, this actually raises the question
913920	918000	I was going to ask about these go contenders in general and how you're judging them where
918800	920800	You're looking at their work as a whole
921520	924800	Given that I don't know some of these risks pay off that these intellectuals take
924800	929920	Some of them don't pay off should we just be looking at their top contributions and just disregard everything else?
930320	934320	For hayek, I think one of the points you have against him is that his top three articles are amazing
934400	936400	But after that there's a drop off
937520	940480	The top risk you take are the only ones that matter. Why are we looking at the other stuff?
940800	943920	I don't think they're the only ones that matter, but I'll weight them pretty heavily
944320	946320	But your failures do reflect
946800	949360	Usually and how you think or what you know about the world
950080	952080	so hayek's failures
952240	957120	For instance his inability to come up with the normative standard in constitution of liberty
958000	960480	It shows in some ways. He just wasn't rigorous enough
960960	966720	He was content with the kind of germanic put a lot of complex ideas out there and hope they're profound
967600	971680	And you see that even in his best work now that is profound
972480	979040	But it's not as if the failures and the best work for all these people are unrelated and same with canes like canes more or less
979120	981120	Changed his mind every year
981200	983200	That's a strength, but it's also a weakness
983600	988640	And by considering canes is really good works and bad works like his defenses of tariffs
989600	991600	You see that and the best work
991600	996000	He also moved on from in some way if you read how to pay for the war in 1940
996480	999760	If you didn't know better, you would think it's someone criticizing the general theory
1001360	1003360	How uh
1003360	1008720	Does quantity have equality all of its own when you think of great intellectuals where many of these people have like volumes and volumes
1008880	1013200	Of work was that necessary for them to get the greatest sets or is the rest of it?
1013200	1017920	Just a distraction from the things that really stand a test of time for the best people it's necessary
1018000	1021920	So john stewart mill wrote an enormous amount most of it's quite interesting
1023040	1025760	But his ability to see things from multiple perspectives
1025840	1032560	I think was in part stemming from the fact that he wrote a lot about many different topics like french history ancient greece
1033360	1035360	He had real depth and breadth
1036240	1042640	If canes is alive today, what are the odds that he's in a polycule in berkeley writing the best written less wrong posts you've ever seen
1044640	1048400	I'm not sure what the counterfactual means. So canes is so british
1049760	1051760	Maybe he's an effective altruist
1052160	1053840	at cambridge
1053840	1060240	And you know given how he seems to have run a sex life. I don't think he needed a polycule like a polycule
1060800	1065280	It's almost a william sony and device to economize on transactions costs
1065680	1070160	But canes according to his own notes seems to have done things on a very casual basis
1070320	1074480	He had a spreadsheet, right of essential partner and from context it appears
1074480	1080320	He met these people very casually and didn't need to be embedded in where the five people who get together regularly
1080960	1085200	So that's not a hypothetical. We saw we think we saw what he did
1086080	1087600	and
1087600	1091520	I think he'd be at cambridge, right? That's where he was. Why should he not today be at cambridge?
1092400	1094400	How did a person
1094720	1098160	How did a gay intellectual get that amount of influence in the britain of that time?
1098160	1102800	When you think of somebody like alan touring, you know helps a britain win world war two and is castrated
1103440	1104400	because of
1104400	1106400	You know one illicit encounter that is caught
1106880	1109680	Well, was it just not public? How did how did he get away with it basically?
1110400	1113600	I don't think it was a secret about canes. He had
1114080	1119520	Interacted with enough people that I think it was broadly known. He was politically very powerful
1119920	1125200	He was astute as someone managing his career. He was one of the most effective people
1125280	1128080	You could say of all time not just amongst economists
1128640	1131920	And i've never seen evidence that canes was in any kind of danger
1132880	1137600	Our touring also may have intersected with national security concerns in a different way
1138400	1143280	I'm not sure we know the fall alan touring story and why it went as badly as it did
1144240	1148560	But there was in the past very selectively and I do mean very selectively
1149120	1153040	More tolerance of deviance than people today sometimes realize
1153600	1157600	Oh interesting and canes benefited from that but again, I would stress the word selectively
1158000	1164240	Say more what determines who is selected for this tolerance. I don't feel I understand that very well, but there's plenty
1165120	1171280	Say in europe and britain of the early 20th century where quote-unquote outrageous things were done
1171760	1174400	And it's hard to find evidence that people were punished for
1175040	1180160	Now what accounts for the difference between them and the people who were punished? I would like to see a very good book on that
1180880	1186320	Hmm. Um, yeah, I guess it's similar to our time, right? We have certain taboos and you can get away with them
1186640	1190000	Yeah, exactly. They say whatever on twitter and other people get cancelled
1190800	1196160	Actually, however, you gotta know it. I feel like you've never been in at least as far as I know of I haven't heard you being in the part of
1196240	1201040	Any single controversy, but uh, you have some opinions out there. I feel people have been very nice to me
1201120	1203360	Yeah, what would you do? How did you become the canes of our time?
1204160	1206160	If we're comparing
1210880	1212880	I think just being good-natured
1212880	1215360	Yeah helps and helping a lot of people helps
1216080	1220080	Entering I'm a huge fan of wrote a paper on him with Michelle Dawson
1220720	1224560	But it's not obvious that he was a very good diplomat and it seems
1225200	1229520	He very likely was a pretty terrible diplomat and that might be feeding into this difference
1230000	1236640	how do you think about the long-term value of um, and the long-term impact of intellectuals you disagree with
1236720	1238480	So do you think over the course of history?
1238480	1243120	Basically the improvements they make to the discourse and the additional things they give us a chance to think about
1243360	1245360	That washes out their object level
1246480	1248480	The things that were object level wrong about or
1248720	1254000	Well, it's worked that way so far, right? So we've had economic growth obviously with interruptions
1254640	1261280	But so much has fed into the stream and you have to be pretty happy with today's world compared with say 1880
1262000	1264000	Uh, the future may or may not bring us the same
1264400	1269920	But if the future brings us continuing economic growth, then i'm gonna say exactly that. Oh be happy
1269920	1273600	They fed into the stream. They may have been wrong, but things really worked out
1274320	1276320	But if the future brings us
1276480	1280160	It a shrinking population asymptotically approaching a very low level
1280880	1287520	And greater poverty and more war then you've got to wonder. Well, who is responsible for that, right? Who would be responsible for that?
1289520	1296080	We don't know but I think secular thinkers will fall in relative status if that's the outcome and that's most
1296480	1299360	prominent intellectuals today myself included. Yeah
1299920	1303840	Who who would rise in status as a result? Well, there's a number of people
1304560	1307200	complaining strenuously about fertility declines
1308080	1310080	Uh, if there's more war
1310640	1317360	Probably the hawks will rise in status whether or not they should an alternative scenario is that the pacifists rise in status
1317680	1322080	But I basically never see the pacifists rising in status for any more than brief moments
1322240	1325360	Like after the vietnam war, maybe they did after all the run
1326320	1330960	Yes, but again that didn't last because world war two swept all that away, right?
1331120	1334320	So the pacifists seem to lose long-term status no matter what
1335760	1338080	And that means the hawks would gain in status
1338640	1345120	And those worried about fertility and whatever technology drives the new wars if that is what happens
1345200	1349040	Let's say it's drones. It's possible, right? Uh people who warned against drones
1349840	1353360	Which is not currently that big a thing. There are quite a few such people
1353760	1355760	But there's no one out there known
1356560	1362720	For worrying about drones the way say illeaser is worried about known for worrying about AI now drones in a way are AI
1362880	1367280	But it's different. Yeah, other than that freedmen steward I'm sure other people have you know talked about
1367760	1369760	We're not that far away from doing sickness. I guess you have
1369840	1374400	I guess there's a thing you do video with millions of views. Whoever made that would rise. I think steward I was wrong
1374400	1376400	What was I'm sorry, uh, that's true
1376560	1381680	But anyways, yeah, but those people could end up as much more important than they are now. Yeah. Okay. Let's talk about hayek
1382000	1385120	Sure. Um, so I before we get into his actual views
1385600	1390480	I think his career is a tremendous white pill in the sense that he writes the rotisserieftum in 1944
1391200	1395520	When nazi germany and so the union are both, you know, prominent players and
1397200	1399680	Honestly, like the way things shaked out, uh
1400880	1406400	I mean, he would be pretty pleased that like a lot of the biggest collectivisms of the day have been, uh wiped out
1406720	1409120	So it is a tremendous white pill. You can have a career like that
1409280	1411280	He was
1411920	1412880	Uh
1412880	1417760	Not as right as he thought at the time, but he ended up being too grumpy in his later years
1417840	1418160	Oh, really?
1418160	1423120	He thought well collectivism is still going to engulf the world and I think he became a grumpy old man
1423840	1426720	And then maybe it's one thing to be a grumpy old man in 2024
1427200	1429680	But to be a grumpy old man in the 80s
1430480	1436400	Didn't seem justified. What was the cause? What like what specifically did he see that he he thought they were
1436400	1442640	Atavistic instincts in the human spirit, which were biologically built in that led us to be collectivists
1442720	1450960	Right and too envious and not appreciative of how impersonal orders worked and that this would cause the west to turn into something quite crummy
1451920	1453920	I wouldn't say he's been proven wrong
1454320	1456800	but a lot of the west has had a pretty good run since then
1457760	1460880	And uh, there's not major evidence that he's correct
1461840	1464720	The bad events we've seen like some war coming back
1465680	1467040	Uh
1467040	1472400	Something weird happening in our politics. I'm not sure how to describe it. I'm not sure they fit the Hayek model
1472720	1475840	A sort of simply the accretion of more socialism
1476640	1481360	Um, but in terms of the basic psychological urges towards envy and resentment
1481600	1485120	Isn't the rise of wokeness provide evidence for his view, but now wokeness
1485440	1488080	I would say is peaked and is falling. That's a big debate
1488960	1491200	I don't see wokeness as our biggest problem
1491360	1497040	I see excessive bureaucracy, sclerotic institutions, kludgeocracy as bigger problems
1497040	1499040	They're not unrelated to wokeness to be clear
1499440	1501760	But I think they're more fundamental and harder to fix
1502640	1505200	Let's talk about uh Hayek's Hayek's uh arguments
1505520	1508560	So obviously he has a famous argument about decentralization
1508960	1513440	But when we look at companies like amazon uber these other big tech companies
1513680	1518800	They actually do a pretty good job of central planning, right? There's like a sea of logistics and drivers and
1519040	1521520	Uh, um trade-offs that they had to square
1522080	1524480	Uh, do they provide evidence that central planning can work?
1525280	1532480	Well, i'm not a cosian so cos in his famous 1937 article said the firm is planning and he contrasted that to the market
1532640	1538880	Right. I think the firm is the market. The firm is always making contracts in the market is subject to market checks and balances
1539280	1541200	to me, it's not
1541200	1545920	You know an island of central planning and the broader shroff of the market. So i'm just not cosian
1546000	1549200	So people are a cosian. This is an embarrassing question for them
1549600	1554080	But i'll just say amazon being great is the market working and they're not centrally planning
1554560	1560240	Even the soviet union it was very bad, but it didn't end up being central planning. It started off that way for a few years
1560960	1561840	so
1561840	1563840	I think people misinterpret
1563920	1566960	Large business firms in many ways on both the left and the right
1567600	1569600	Wait, but under this argument
1569760	1575600	It still adds to the credence of the people who argue that basically we need the government to control
1575920	1577920	because if it is the case that soviet union is still
1578160	1583840	Uh, not central planning people would say well, but yeah, but that's kind of what I want in terms of there's still kind of checks in terms of
1583920	1587520	import exports of the market test is still applied to the government in that sense
1588000	1592080	Uh, well, what's wrong with that argument that basically you can treat the government as that kind of firm
1592960	1600400	I'm not sure I followed your question. I would say this i view the later soviet union as being highly decentralized
1600720	1605360	Managers optimizing their own rents and setting prices too low to take in bribes
1605680	1608800	a la paul craig roberts what he wrote in the 80s
1609680	1616160	And that's a very bad decentralized system and it was sort of backed up by something highly central communist party in the ussr
1617120	1624080	But it's not like the early attempts at true central planning in the soviet union in the 20s right after the revolution
1624240	1627920	Which did totally fail and were abandoned pretty quickly even by lenin
1628160	1629280	Hmm
1629280	1635360	Would you kind of 50s period in the soviet union as more centrally planned than or more decentralized by that point decentralized
1635440	1637440	You have central plans for a number of things
1638080	1641200	Obviously weaponry steel production you have targets
1641440	1645920	But even that tends to collapse into decentralized action just with bad incentives
1646560	1649840	So your explanation for why did the soviet union have high growth in the 50s?
1650400	1653680	It is it more ketchup? Is it more that they were in communists at the time?
1654000	1657920	How would you explain a lot of the soviet high growth was rebuilding after the war
1658320	1664960	Which the central planning can do relatively well right you see government rebuilding city say in germany that works pretty well
1665440	1669520	But most of all this is even before world war two just urbanization
1670960	1674240	It shouldn't be underrated today given we've observed china
1674320	1676960	But so much of chinese growth was driven by urbanization
1677360	1682640	So much of soviet growth you take someone working on a farm producing almost nothing put them in the city
1683280	1685840	Even under a bad system. They're going to be a lot more productive
1686560	1690240	And that drove so much of soviet growth before after the war
1690880	1694240	But that at some point more or less ends right as it has
1694560	1699520	Well, it hasn't quite ended with china, but it certainly slowed down and people don't pay enough attention to that
1699600	1704480	I don't know why it now seems pretty obvious. Hmm. Uh, but but going back to the the point about firms
1704720	1705840	so
1705840	1709840	I guess I the point I was trying to make is I don't understand why the argument you make that
1710400	1715440	Well, these firms are still within the market in the sense that they they have to pass these market tests
1716080	1719200	Why that couldn't also apply to government directed production?
1719760	1723520	Because then people sometimes it does right government runs a bunch of enterprises
1724560	1730560	Uh, they may have monopoly positions, but many are open to the market in singapore government hospitals compete with private hospitals
1731200	1736480	Government hospitals seem to be fine. I know they get some means of support. Yeah, but they're not all terrible
1736800	1742080	But I guess it's a general principle you'd be against more government, uh, directed production, right?
1743040	1749280	Well depends on the context. So if it's say the military, uh, probably we ought to be building a lot more of some particular things
1750080	1752640	And it will be done through Boeing, Lockheed and so on
1752800	1756720	But the government's directing it paying for it in some way quote-unquote planning it
1757280	1760880	And we need to do that. We've at times done that well in the past
1761840	1763120	so
1763120	1767600	People overrate the distinction between government and market. I think especially libertarians
1768160	1771520	But that said there's an awful lot of government bureaucracy. That's terrible
1772000	1773840	Doesn't have a big market check
1773840	1779840	But very often governments act through markets and have to contract or hire consultants or hire outside parties
1780160	1782160	And it's more like a market than you think
1782240	1783920	um
1783920	1785600	I want to ask you about another part of Hayek
1785680	1790960	So he has an argument about how it's really hard to aggregate information towards a central planner
1791280	1798000	But then more recently there have been our results in computer science that just finding the general equilibrium is computationally intractable
1798480	1803120	Um, and which raises the question. Well, the market is somehow solving this problem, right?
1803200	1808240	separate from the problem getting the information make it use making use of information to allocate scarce resources
1808800	1812320	Um, how how is that computationally a process that's possible?
1812800	1819280	Uh, you know, I'm sure you're aware like the linear optimization and non-convex constraints. How does the market solve this problem?
1820160	1822800	Well, the market's not solving for a general equilibrium
1823040	1825920	It's just solving for something that gets us into the next day
1826480	1831120	And that's a big part of the triumph just living to fight another day wealth not going down
1831440	1833200	Not everyone quitting
1833200	1839520	And if you can do that things will get better and that's what we're pretty good at doing is just building a sustainable structure
1840160	1843840	And a lot of it isn't sustainable like the fools who start these new small businesses
1844000	1847920	But they do pretty quickly disappear and that's part of the market as well
1848720	1852960	So if you view the whole thing in terms of computing a general equilibrium
1853200	1857040	I think one of high ex-grade insights is that's just the wrong way to think about the whole problem
1857680	1859680	so lack of
1860320	1866720	Computational ability to do that doesn't worry me for either the market or planning because to the extent planning does work
1866800	1868800	It doesn't work by succeeding at that
1869200	1871200	Like singaporean public hospitals
1871680	1875040	Don't work because they solve some computational problem
1875280	1880960	They seem to work because the people running them care about doing a good job and enough of the workers go along with that
1881440	1885680	Yeah, so related to that. I think in the meaning of competition. He makes the point that
1886240	1890720	um, the the most interesting part of markets is when they go from one equilibrium to another
1890880	1895040	Because that's where they're trying to figure out what to produce and how to produce a better and so on and not the
1895040	1898880	Equilibrium's themselves and it seemed related to the peter teal point in zero to one that
1899280	1903440	Uh, monopoly is when you have interesting things happen because when there's just competitive equilibrium
1903520	1905520	There's no profits to
1905680	1907680	invest in r&d or to do cool new things
1907760	1913840	Do those seem like related points? Am I reading absolutely a high xs a competition as a discovery process or procedure
1914480	1920480	Makes that point very explicitly and that's one of his handful of greatest essays one of the greatest essays in all of economics
1921920	1927040	Is there a contradiction in hayek in the sense that the decentralization he's calling for
1927600	1933040	Uh results in the results and have a specialist having to use the very scientism and statistical aggregates
1933440	1936880	Of course that high fender rate scientism scientism is great
1937280	1938720	It can be abused
1938720	1942880	But we all rely on scientism if you have an mRNA vaccine in your arm
1942960	1945040	Well, how do you feel about scientism and so on?
1946160	1952320	How much would we worry about uh this opening up the whole system to fragilities if there's like no one mind that understands
1952400	1958560	Large parts of how everything fits together people talk about this in the context of if there's a war in china and the the producers
1958640	1962640	Didn't think about that possibility when they put valuable manufacturing in taiwan and stuff like that
1963440	1966880	No one mind understanding things is inevitable under all systems
1967360	1972800	This gets into some of the alignment debates right if you had one mind that understood everything or could control everything
1973120	1976160	You have to worry a great deal about the corruptibility of that mind
1976480	1983360	So legibility transparency are not per se good. You want enough of them in the right places, but you need some kind of balance
1984720	1986720	so I think uh
1987040	1990000	Supply chains are no longer an under analyzed problem
1990240	1992720	But until covet they were and they're a big deal
1993440	1995840	And the haiki an argument doesn't always work
1996640	1999200	Because the signal you have is of the current price
1999680	2003120	And that's not telling you how high are the inframarginal values
2003520	2008960	If you get say cut off from being able to buy vaccines from india because you're you know at the bottom of the queue
2010240	2011280	So that was a problem
2011280	2017120	It was the market falling because the price doesn't tell you inframarginal values and when you move from some
2017840	2022560	Ability to buy the output to zero those inframarginal values really matter. Hmm
2023680	2029600	What would hayek make of ai agents and as they get more powerful you have some market between the ai agents
2030160	2034800	Uh, the there's some sort of decentralized order as a result. What what insights would you have about that?
2035200	2038880	Well, a lot of hayekians wrote about these issues including at george mason
2039520	2043920	In the 1980s and I think some of those people even talked to hayek about this
2044480	2048320	And my recollection which is imperfect is that he found all this very interesting
2048800	2054880	And in the spirit of his work and don levoi was leading this research paragraph. He died prematurely of cancer
2056000	2059280	Uh bill tallow was also involved and some of this has been written up
2060160	2065040	And it is very hayekian and george mason george mason actually was a pioneer in this area
2065760	2070160	Well, what do you make of the agents the market between them and the sort of infrastructure and order that would uh
2070160	2073520	That would need to facilitate that they're going to replicate markets on their own
2073600	2079600	This has been my prediction and I think they're going to evolve their own currencies. Maybe at first they'll use bitcoin
2080640	2085760	But there'll be an entire property rights will be based at least at first on what we now call nfts
2086400	2089120	I'm not sure that will end up being the right name for them
2089680	2095600	But if you want property rights in a so-called imaginary world, that's where you would start with bitcoin and nfts
2096320	2099840	So I don't know what percent of gdp this will be at first it will be quite small
2100240	2106000	But it will grow over time and it's going to show hayek to have been right that had these decentralized systems evolved
2106400	2112880	Do you anticipate that it'll be sort of a completely different sphere and there's like the ai agents economy and there's a human economy
2112960	2114960	And they obviously have links between them
2115360	2118720	But it's not intermixed like they're not on the same social media or the same
2119520	2122800	A task rabbit or whatever. It's like it's a very separate infrastructure that's needed to
2123520	2125680	For the ai agents to talk to themselves versus talk to humans
2126000	2131760	I don't see why we would enforce segregation now. You might have some segregated outlets like maybe x twitter
2132320	2136080	Well, we'll keep off the bots. Let's say it can even manage to do that
2136560	2139440	But if I want to hire, you know a proofreader
2140000	2143680	I'm going to deal with the ai sector and pay them in bitcoin
2144320	2150080	And I'll just say to my like personal ai assistant. Hey go out and hire an ai and pay them with whatever
2150480	2152720	And then just not think about it anymore and it will happen
2152960	2157840	Maybe because there's like much higher transaction costs with dealing with humans and interacting with the human world
2158000	2161520	Whereas they can just send a bunch of vectors to each other. It's much faster for them to just
2162960	2165040	Just like have a separate dedicated infrastructure for that
2165280	2170480	And but transactions costs for dealing with humans will fall because you'll deal with their quote-unquote assistance, right?
2171200	2176000	So you'll only deal with the difficult human when you need to and people who are very effective
2176240	2178720	Will segregate their tasks in a way that reflects
2179200	2186960	Their comparative advantage and people who are not effective will be very poor at that and that will lead to some kind of bifurcation of personal productivity
2189200	2195120	Like how well do you know what to delegate to your ai? I'll predict you'll be very good at it. You may not have figured it out yet
2196480	2202160	But say you're like a a plus on it and other people are d that's a big comparative advantage for you
2202400	2203520	Hmm
2203520	2204800	So you
2204800	2209280	We're talking I guess about like gpt 5 level models. What do you think in your mind about like, okay?
2209360	2212640	This is gpt 5. What happens with gpt 6 gpt 7? Do you see it?
2213120	2218560	Or just do you still think in the frame of having a bunch of ras or does it seem like a different sort of thing at some point?
2219200	2221440	I'm not sure with those numbers going up
2222240	2223360	mean
2223360	2227360	A what a gpt 7 would look like or how much smarter it could get
2227920	2229920	Think people make too many assumptions there
2230240	2236400	It could be the real advantages or integrating it into workflows by things that are not better gpt's at all
2236960	2239600	And once you get to gpt say 5.5
2240320	2246800	I'm not sure you can just turn up the dial on smarts and have it like integrate general relativity and quantum mechanics
2246880	2247520	Why not?
2247520	2251760	I don't think that's how intelligence works and this is a hacky and point and some of these problems
2251760	2256880	There just may be no answer like maybe the universe isn't that legible and if it's not that legible
2257360	2259360	the gpt 11
2259840	2262960	Doesn't really make sense as a you know a creature or whatever
2264240	2268240	Is isn't there a hacking argument to be made that listen you can have billions of copies of these things
2268880	2274960	Imagine the sort of decentralized order that could result the amount of decentralized tasks of knowledge that billions of copies talking to each other could have
2275360	2278000	That in and of itself is an argument to be made about
2278800	2283680	The whole thing as a as an emergent order will be much more powerful than we were anticipating
2284080	2290080	Well, I think it will be highly productive. What tacit knowledge means with a eyes. I don't think we understand yet
2290320	2292320	Is it by definition all
2292320	2298720	non tacit or does the fact that how gpt 4 works is not legible to us or even its creators so much
2299360	2303600	Does that mean it's possessing of tacit knowledge or is it not knowledge?
2303920	2306960	See none of those categories are well thought out in my opinion
2307520	2312400	So we need to restructure our whole discourse about tacit knowledge in some new different way
2312800	2314800	But I agree these networks
2315040	2319200	Are they eyes even before like gpt 11? They're going to be super productive
2319760	2323840	But they're still going to face bottlenecks, right? And I don't know how good they'll be
2323920	2329760	It's a overcoming the behavioral bottlenecks of actual human beings the bottlenecks of the law and regulation
2331120	2333920	And we're going to have more regulation as we have more a eyes, right? Yeah
2334160	2339280	Well, when you say there'll be uncertainties, I think you made this argument when you were responding to alex fstein on fossil future
2339280	2344800	Or you said the uncertainties also extend out into the domain where there's a bad outcome or a much bigger outcome than you're anticipating
2344880	2346880	That's right. So can we apply the same?
2347440	2351040	Argument to ai like the fact that there is uncertainty is also a reason for worry
2352000	2357280	Well, it's always reason for worry, but there's uncertainty about a lot of things and ai will help us with those other uncertainties
2357920	2363040	So annette, do you think more intelligence is likely to be good or bad including against x risk?
2363360	2365360	And I think it's more likely to be good
2365920	2370400	So if it were the only risk I'd be more worried about it than if there's a whole multitude of risks
2370800	2372800	But clearly there's a whole multitude of risks
2373040	2375280	But since people grew up in pretty stable times
2375600	2381440	They tend not to see that in emotionally vivid terms and then this one monster comes along and they're all terrified
2382720	2384720	What would hayek think of prediction markets?
2385680	2387920	Well, there were prediction markets and hayek's time
2387920	2394560	I don't know that he wrote about them, but I strongly suspect he would see them as markets that through prices communicate information
2395040	2397520	But even at the like they're on the time of the civil war
2397600	2401520	There were so-called bucket shops in the u.s. In new york where you would bet on things
2402160	2406560	They were betting markets with cash settlement probably never called prediction markets
2406560	2411200	But they were exactly that later on they were banned, but it's an old-standing thing
2412400	2417440	There were betting markets on lives in uh 17th century britain different attempts to outlaw them
2417440	2422240	Which I think basically ended up succeeding, but under the table. I'm sure it still went on to some extent
2422480	2423040	Yeah
2423040	2427440	The the reason it's interesting to think about this is because his whole argument about the price system is that
2427760	2430560	You can have a single dial that aggregates so much information
2430640	2432880	But it's precisely for this and that before that reason
2432880	2436240	It's so useful to somebody who's trying to decide, you know, based on that information
2436240	2442320	But it's precisely for this reason that it's so aggregated that it's hard to learn about any one particular input to that dial
2442400	2446160	But I would stress it's not a single dial and whether hayek thought it was a single dial
2446480	2448480	I think you can argue that either way
2448800	2452800	So people in markets, they also observe quantities. They observe reaction speeds
2453200	2458080	There's a lot of dimensions to prices other than just oh this newspaper cost four dollars
2458800	2460800	Other terms on which it's advertised
2461200	2466000	So markets work so well because people are solving this complex multidimensional problem
2466240	2472560	And the price really is not a sufficient statistic the way it is in arahan debrew and I think at times hayek understood that
2472880	2476720	And at other times he writes as if he doesn't understand it, but it's an important point
2477120	2478720	Hmm
2478720	2483760	Someone related question. What does it tell us about the difficulty of preserving good institutions? Good people?
2484800	2487280	That the median age of a corporation is 18 years
2487920	2490720	And they don't get better over time right decade after decade what corporation?
2490720	2494240	There's rich corporations that continue improving in that way
2494720	2497440	Well, I think some firms keep improving for a long time
2497440	2501120	So there are japanese firms that date back to the 17th century
2501600	2505920	Right, they must be better today or even in 1970 than they were a way back when
2506800	2508800	Like the leading four or five danish firms
2509600	2511360	None of them are
2511360	2513360	younger than the 1920s
2513440	2514960	So maersk
2514960	2518400	You know the firm that came up with ozampic the pharmaceutical firm
2519280	2523040	They must be much better than they were back then right they have to be
2523840	2524880	So
2524880	2528640	How that is possible to me is a puzzle, but I think in plenty of cases it's true
2529680	2531680	It can really say that the
2532080	2535520	The best firms in the world aren't ones that have been improving over time
2536000	2538000	Uh
2538240	2541600	You know if you look at the biggest companies in our market cap, it's not like this is what it
2541680	2544480	You what it takes to get there is hundreds of years of continual refinement
2545040	2548320	Uh, what does that tell us about the world or just as well hundreds of years?
2548400	2552400	But again, don't be overly biased by the us experience and the tech sector
2552800	2554800	There's around the world plenty of firms
2555280	2558240	That at least seem to get better as they get older
2558640	2562160	Certainly their market cap goes up some of that might just be a population effect
2562560	2566400	Maybe their productivity per some unit is in some ways going down
2567120	2569120	Uh, but that's a very common case
2569360	2574960	And why the us is such an outlier is an interesting question right israel clearly is an outlier
2575440	2577200	In a sense, they only
2577200	2580880	Have pretty young firms right and they've done very well in terms of growth
2581200	2583040	Can you be explained by the fact that in these other countries?
2583040	2586720	It's actually just harder to start a new company not necessarily the older companies are actually getting better
2587920	2591920	Uh possibly but it does seem the older companies are often getting better right like in danmark
2593120	2595280	So, you know, take china is
2596240	2599120	Pretty much entirely new firms because of communism
2599920	2602720	Japan in particular seems to have a lot of very old firms
2603040	2606720	I don't know if they're getting better, but I don't think you can write that off as a possibility
2608160	2612560	This is hayak in competition as a discovery process and it seems like you predicted nimbyism
2612880	2614880	So he says in a democratic society
2615120	2621760	It would be completely impossible using commands that could not be regarded as just to bring about those changes
2621840	2627680	That are undoubtedly necessary, but the necessity of which could not be strictly demonstrated in a particular case
2628400	2631920	Uh, so it seems like he's kind of talking about what we today call nimbyism
2632560	2634880	It's sure and there's plenty of nimbyism in earlier times
2635200	2638480	You look at the 19th century debates over restructuring paris
2639040	2641760	Housemen and putting in the broader boulevards and the like
2642400	2646080	That met with very strong opposition. It's a kind of miracle that it happened. Yeah
2647280	2650000	Is this is this a thing that's inherent to the democratic system?
2650000	2653760	I recently interviewed dominant Cummings and obviously planning is a big issue in the uk
2654080	2659200	It seems like every country has every democratic country has this kind of problem and most autocratic countries have it too
2659600	2665200	Now china is an exception. They will probably slide into some kind of nimbyism even if they stay autocratic
2666080	2667360	um
2667360	2672480	Just people resist change interest groups always matter public opinion a la david hum always matters
2673360	2674640	and uh
2674640	2679040	It's easy to not do anything on a given day, right and that just keeps on sliding into the future
2680720	2684080	So but not in the i guess india has had a lot of nimbyism
2684160	2688800	It's fallen away greatly under modi and especially what the state governments have done
2689680	2692320	But it's can be very hard to build things in india still
2693760	2696960	Although it is a democracy. I guess the china example. We'll see what happens there
2697600	2700320	That's right. Uh, but it would be very surprising
2701280	2706080	Because the chinese government is highly responsive to public opinion on most but not all issues
2706640	2710480	So why wouldn't they become more nimby especially with the shrinking population?
2710960	2714320	They're they're way overbilled, right? So the pressure to build will be weak
2714720	2717920	And in cases where they ought to build I would think quite soon. They won't
2719600	2726160	How how much of economics is a study of the uh, the systems that human beings use to allocate scarce resources
2726160	2729760	And how much is is just something you'd expect to true be true of aliens ai's
2730720	2733680	It's interesting when you read the history of economic thought how often they make
2734640	2740560	Um, they make mention of human nature specifically like canyons is talking about the people have high discount rates, right?
2742560	2751440	Yeah, but what are your thoughts here my former colleague gordon tallick wrote a very interesting book on the economics of ant societies and animal societies
2752320	2758640	And very often they obey human like principles or more accurately humans obey non-human animal like principles
2759200	2764640	So I suspect it's fairly universal and depends less on quote-unquote human nature
2765040	2770160	Then we sometimes like to suggest maybe that is a bit of a knock on some behavioral economics
2771040	2774880	The logic of the system arman elshin wrote on this gary becker wrote on this
2775200	2780800	There was some debates on this in the early 1960s and that the automatic principles of profit and loss
2781440	2783440	and selection at a firm
2783840	2785280	Firm-wide level
2785280	2789760	Really matters and it's responsible for a lot of economics being true. I think that's correct
2790240	2792240	actually that raises an interesting question of
2792320	2798480	Uh, within firms they the sort of input they're getting from the outside world the ground truth data is
2798960	2800960	profit loss bankruptcy. It's like very
2801760	2806400	Uh, very condensed information and from this they had to make the determination of who to fire who to hire who to promote
2806560	2808560	What project to pursue?
2809120	2814160	Uh, you know, how do you make sense of how firms disaggregate this this very condensed information?
2814800	2819520	I would like to see a very good estimate of how much your productivity gains is just from selection
2820160	2823600	And how much is from while smart humans figure out better ways of doing things
2824800	2828560	And there's some related pieces on this in the international trade literature
2828800	2833360	So when you have free or trade a shockingly high percentage of the productivity gains
2833920	2836720	Come from your worst firms being bankrupted by the free trade
2837440	2840080	And alex tabarak has some mr posts on this
2840480	2842080	I don't recall the exact numbers
2842080	2849520	But it was higher than almost anyone thought and that to me suggests the alchi and becker mechanisms of evolution at the level of the firm
2850000	2851840	Enterprise or even sector
2851840	2856080	They're just a lot more important than human ingenuity and that's a pretty hayekian point
2856560	2860720	Hayek presumably read those pieces in the 60s. I don't think he ever commented on them
2861520	2863040	interesting
2863040	2865040	Let's talk about uh mill
2866000	2868000	uh
2869840	2875760	So his arguments about uh the law force against uh woman and how basically throughout history
2876160	2881520	The the the state of uh woman in in his society is not natural or the wisdom of the ages
2881520	2884720	But just the result of the fact that men are stronger and have codified that
2885120	2888640	Can you apply that argument into today's society against children and the way we treat them?
2889760	2894240	Yes, I think we should treat children much better. We've made quite a few steps in that direction
2894640	2897760	It's interesting to think of mill's argument as it relates to hayek
2898560	2903280	So mill is arguing you can see more than just the local information. So keep in mind when mill wrote
2904000	2908480	Every society that he knew of at least treated women very poorly oppressed women
2909120	2911920	Women because they were physically weaker or at a big disadvantage
2912160	2917120	If you think there's some matrilineal exceptions mill didn't know about them. So it appeared universal
2917920	2920960	And mill's chief argument is to say you're making a big mistake
2921680	2927840	If you overly aggregate information from this one observation that behind it is a lot of structure
2928160	2933280	And a lot of the structure is contingent and that if i mill unpack the contingency for you
2933840	2935840	You will see behind the signals
2936240	2940720	So mill is much more rationalist than hayek. It's one reason why hayek hated mill
2941280	2943280	But clearly on the issue of women
2943520	2947840	Mill was completely correct that women can do much better will do much better
2948240	2952640	It's not clear what the end of this process will be. It will just continue for a long time
2954080	2956080	Women achieving in excellent ways
2956800	2962320	And it's mill's greatest work. I think it's one of the greatest pieces of social social science and it is anti hayekian
2963200	2965200	It's anti small c conservatism
2966080	2971520	His other book on liberty is very hayekian though, right in the sense that the free speech is needed because information is
2972240	2975200	Is it contained in many different people's minds? That's right
2975280	2978320	And I think mill integrated sort of you could call it hayek
2978800	2983680	An anti hayek better than hayek ever did. That's why I think mill is the greater thinker of the two
2985040	2987040	But but on the topic of children
2987680	2991440	What wouldn't mill say specifically? I guess you could have talked about it if you wanted to but
2991760	2995600	I don't know if you was in today's world. We sent into school. They're there for eight hours a day
2995840	2997840	Most of the time is probably wasted
2998080	3002400	And we just like use a lot of coercion on them that we don't need to how would we think how would he think about this issue?
3003200	3007760	There's mill's own upbringing, which was quite strict and by current standards oppressive
3008160	3011200	But apparently extremely effective in making mill smart
3012000	3016080	So I think mill very much thought that kids should be induced
3016720	3018720	to learn the classics
3018720	3021600	But he also stressed they needed free play of the imagination
3022080	3028560	In a way that he drew from german and also british romanticism and he wanted some kind of synthesis of the two
3029200	3034160	Uh, but by current standards mill. I think still would be seen as a meanie toward kids
3034240	3036640	But he was progressive by the standards of his own day
3036960	3042000	Do you buy the arguments about aristocratic tutoring for people like mill and um, there's many other cases like this
3042000	3047280	But that you know, since they were kids they were taught in the taught by one-on-one tutors and that's that explains part of their
3048160	3049520	greatness
3049520	3054320	I believe in one-on-one tutors, but I don't know how much of those examples is selection, right?
3054800	3056800	So i'm not sure how important it is
3057280	3061920	But just as a matter of fact if I were a wealthy person and just had a new kid
3062000	3067520	I would absolutely invest in one-on-one tutors. Hmm. You're talking the book about how mill is very concerned about the
3068320	3070400	quality and the character development of the population
3071120	3075840	Uh, but when we think about the fact that somebody like him was elected to the parliament at the time
3075920	3078720	the greatest thinker who's alive is elected to uh, to uh,
3079920	3083280	To government and it's hard to imagine that could be true in with
3084000	3088000	Today's world does he have a does he have a point with the regards to the quality of the population?
3089200	3092560	Well mill as with women he thought a lot of improvement was possible
3092800	3098000	Yeah, and we shouldn't overly generalize from seeing all the dunces around us. Yeah, so to speak
3098640	3101120	Uh, maybe the the book is still out on that one
3102560	3106240	But it's an encouraging belief and I think it's more right than wrong
3106320	3111600	There's been a lot of moral progress since mill's time right and everything but certainly how people treat children
3112480	3115280	and or their their why how men treat their wives
3116720	3118640	and uh
3118640	3120640	Even when you see negative reversals
3121360	3124080	Stephen pinker so far seems to be right on that one
3124720	3128000	But you do see places, you know, like Iran how women were treated
3128880	3133200	Seems to have been much better in the 1970s than it is today. So there are definitely reversals
3133440	3139680	but on the specific reversal of somebody of mill's quality probably wouldn't get elected to congress in the us or
3140000	3147040	Parliament of the uk. Is it how how big a deal is that advice may get through the cracks due to all the local statesmen who wisely advise
3147680	3150320	their representatives in the house, right? So
3152400	3156960	I don't know how much that process is better or worse compared to say the 1960s
3157120	3161120	I know plenty of smart people who think it's worse. I'm not convinced that's true. Hmm
3162080	3164080	Let's talk about smith
3164080	3166080	Adam smith. Yeah
3166640	3168160	um
3168160	3174720	Okay, so the one of the things I find really remarkable about him is he so he publishes in 1776 the wealth of nations
3175040	3178880	And basically around that time gibbon publishes the decline and fall of the roman empire. Yep
3179360	3179760	um
3179760	3184720	So he publishes the decline and fall of the roman empire and one of his lines in there is if if you were asked to
3185280	3189840	It stayed a period of time and man's condition was what is his best? It was you know during the reign of comotas to demission
3190320	3195760	Uh, and that's like 2000 years before that, right? So there's basically been at least it's like plausible to somebody really smart
3195760	3198480	That there's basically been no growth since for 2000 years
3198960	3203280	Uh and in that context to be making the case or markets and mechanization and division of labor
3203440	3207200	I think it's like even more impressive when you when you put it in the context that he has like basically been seeing
3207520	3209520	You know 0.5 percent or less growth
3209520	3215760	Strongly agree and this is in a way smith being like mill. Yeah smiths is seeing the local information of very small growth
3216320	3218960	And the world barely being better than the roman empire
3219520	3224080	And inferring from that with increasing returns division of labor how much is possible
3224880	3228400	So smith is a bit more of a rationalist than hyac makes him out to be right
3229360	3233200	Now I I wonder if we use the same sort of
3233840	3237040	Extrapolative thinking that smith uses of we haven't seen that much growth yet
3237040	3240640	But if you apply these sorts of principles, uh, this is what you would expect to see
3241120	3244480	What would he make of the potential ai economy where we see two percent growth?
3245040	3248640	A year now, but you have you know billions of potential more agents or something
3248880	3254320	Would he say well actually you might have 10 growth because of this like this is a you would need more economic principles to explain this
3254800	3258560	Or that just adding that to our list of existing principles would imply big gains
3259520	3262240	It's hard to say what smith would predict for ai
3262800	3267200	My suspicion is that the notion of 10 growth was simply not conceivable to him
3267600	3273840	So he wouldn't have predicted it because he never saw anything like it that to him three percent growth would be a bit like
3274480	3276640	10 growth it would just shock him
3277280	3279280	And and bold him over
3279840	3284720	But smith does also emphasize different human bottlenecks and constraints of the law
3285840	3291440	So it's quite possible smith would see those bottlenecks as mattering and checking ai growth and its speed
3292640	3296240	But as a principle given the change we saw pre
3297360	3299360	pre-industrial revolution and after 1870
3299600	3300560	Um
3300560	3306320	Does does that does to you it seemed plausible that you could go from the current regime to a regime where you have 10 growth
3306320	3308320	for decades on end
3308320	3311120	That does not seem plausible to me, but I would stress the point
3311840	3315600	That high rates of growth decades on end the numbers cease to have meaning
3316320	3319920	Because the numbers make the most sense when the economy is broadly similar
3320400	3325120	Like oh everyone eats apples and each year there's 10 more apples at a roughly constant price
3325600	3330320	As the basket changes the numbers become meaningless. It's not to deny. There's a lot of growth
3331040	3334240	Uh, but you can think about it better by discarding the number
3334800	3339120	And presumably ai will change the composition of various bundles quite a bit over time
3339600	3343440	So when you hear these estimates about what the gdp per capita was in the roman empire
3343440	3346640	Do you just disregard that and think in terms of qualitative changes from that time?
3347520	3349520	Depends what they're being compared to
3350080	3357120	So there's pieces in economic history that are looking at say 17th 18th century europe comparing it to the roman empire
3357280	3360720	Most of gdp's agriculture, which is pretty comparable, right?
3361680	3365200	Especially in europe, it's not wheat versus corn. It's wheat and wheat
3366400	3369280	And i've seen estimates that i'll say by 1730
3369920	3375040	Some parts of western europe are clearly better off than the roman empire at its peak, but like within range
3375840	3379280	That those are the best estimates. I know and I trust those they're not perfect
3380080	3382480	But I don't think there's an index number problem so much
3382560	3383680	Hmm
3383680	3386640	And so when people say we're 50 percent richer than
3387200	3389760	An average roman at the peak of the empire you
3390000	3392720	You but this this kind of thinking doesn't make sense to you
3392800	3396560	It doesn't make sense to me and a simple way to show that let's say you could buy
3397280	3399280	From the sears robot catalog of today
3399520	3405840	Yeah, or from 1905 and you have $50,000 to spend which catalog would you rather buy from?
3407280	3409280	You have to think about it, right?
3409520	3415200	Now if you just look at changes in the cpi, it should be obvious you would prefer the catalog from 1905
3415440	3418720	Everything's so much cheaper that white shirt costs almost nothing
3419520	3423600	Right at the same time. You don't want that stuff. It's not mostly part of the modern bundle
3424080	3430000	So even if you ended up preferring the earlier catalog the fact that you have to think about it reflects the ambiguities
3431440	3435520	When you read the contemporaries of smith other economists were writing at the time
3435760	3437760	Uh, were his arguments
3438560	3444800	Just, uh, clearly given the evidence at the time much better than everybody around or was it just that expose to is clearly right
3444880	3448480	But given the arguments at the time it could have gone any one of different ways
3449760	3453680	Well, there aren't that many economists at the time of smith, so it depends what you're counting
3454400	3457920	I mean the two fellow scots you could compare smith to or sir james stewart
3458400	3461440	Who published a major work? I think in 1767
3462000	3466880	On some matters stewart was ahead of smith not most clearly smith was far greater
3467280	3473040	But stewart was no slouch and the other point of comparison is david hume smith's best friend, of course
3473840	3478800	Uh per page you could argue. Hume was better than smith certainly on monetary theory. Hume was better than smith
3479600	3482080	Now he's not a goat contender. He just didn't do enough
3482880	3488640	But I wouldn't say smith was ahead of hume. He had more and more important insights
3489440	3495200	But hume was pretty impressive now if you're talking about oh like the 18th century german camera lists
3495840	3497200	uh
3497200	3502160	Well, they were bad mercantilists, but there's people say writing in sweden in the 1760s
3502880	3507440	Analyzing exchange rates who had better understandings of exchange rates than smith ever did
3507840	3509840	So it's not that he just dominated everyone
3510640	3512000	um
3512000	3517360	Let me offer some other potential nominees that were not in the book for goat and I want your opinions of them
3517840	3524480	um, henry george in terms of explaining how land is fundamentally different from labor and capital when we're thinking about the economy
3525200	3530160	Well, first i'm not sure land is that fundamentally different from labor and capital a lot of the value of land
3530560	3536880	Comes from improvements and what's an improvement can be quite subtle. It doesn't just have to be you know putting a plow to the land
3537680	3540480	So I would put george in the top 25
3541040	3542720	very important thinker
3542720	3544720	but he's a bit of a
3544800	3549840	Not a one-note johnny his book on protectionism is still one of the best books on free trade
3550560	3553600	But he circumscribed in a way say smith and mill were not
3554880	3556320	uh
3556320	3563600	Today is he uh, uh, would does the status rise we see rents in big cities status is way up for this reason right of yinbi nimbi
3563680	3565680	And I think that's correct. He was undervalued
3566320	3568320	He's worth reading very carefully
3568800	3571440	A few years ago. We're recording here at mercatus. We had a
3572320	3577840	Like 12 person two day session with peter teal just on reading henry george. It's all we did
3578720	3581120	And people came away. Uh, very impressed. I think
3582000	3587040	I didn't for people who are interested. They might enjoy the episode I did with larce du set. Uh, who oh, I don't know about this
3587200	3592160	He's a georgist. Oh, yeah, he's uh, uh, he's he's a really smart guy. He wrote
3592800	3597040	Uh, basically he he wrote a book review of henry george that once got alexander's book review contest
3597280	3600480	Oh, I know what this is and then he's just turned it into a whole book of his own
3600640	3605920	Which is actually really good. Um, and I think there's something truly humane in george when you read him
3606320	3608720	That can be a bit infectious. That's positive. Um
3610240	3611280	And
3611280	3615040	It's some insane there was some insane turnout for his funeral, right? Like he was he was very popular at the time
3615040	3619440	He wrote yeah, and that was deserved. Yeah, uh, I guess you already answered this question
3619440	3625040	But ronal cos in terms of helping us think about firms and you know property rights and transaction costs
3625360	3630640	Well, even though I think the 1937 piece is wrong. It did create one of the most important genres
3630960	3634640	He gets a lot of credit for that. He gets a lot of credit for the coast theorem
3635040	3641360	The fcc property rights piece is superb. The lighthouse piece is very good. Again, he's in the top 25
3641840	3644560	But in terms of you like his quantity its own quality
3645360	3648320	It's just not quite enough. There's no macro
3649120	3653280	Oh, but of course you rate him very very highly. How about your former advisor thomas shelling?
3653280	3660720	He is a top tier noble laureate, but I don't think he's a serious contender for greatest economist of all time
3661120	3667120	He gets the most credit for making game theory intuitive empirical and workable and that's worth a lot
3669120	3675200	Uh economics of self command he was a pioneer, but in a way that's just going back to the greeks and smith
3676480	3680320	He's not a serious contender for goat, but a top tier noble laureate for sure
3680480	3686800	You have you have a fun quote in uh in the book on aro where you say his work was a noble prize winning important
3686800	3688800	But not important important
3689200	3692640	Well some parts of it were important important like how to price securities
3693520	3697840	So I think I underrated aro a bit in the book if you ask like what regrets do I have about the book?
3698640	3702560	I say very very nice things about aro, but I think I should have pushed him even more
3702800	3704800	What would aro say about prediction markets?
3705120	3708880	Well, he was really the pioneer of theoretically understanding how they work
3708960	3710960	Yeah, so uh
3711680	3717440	He was around until quite recently. I'm sure he had things to say about prediction markets probably positive. Hmm
3718160	3720160	um
3720160	3726240	Uh you so one of the points you make in the book is economics at the time was really a way of carrying forward big ideas about the world
3726640	3731680	What discipline today is where that happens? Well internet writing. It's not a discipline
3731920	3735440	But it's a sphere and plenty of it happens more than ever before
3736000	3740720	But it's segregated from what counts as original theorizing in the academic sense of that word
3741680	3743920	Is that a good or bad segregation? I'm not sure
3745200	3751680	But it's really a very sharp radical break from how things had been and it's why I don't think there'll be a new goat contender
3751920	3755360	Probably not ever or if there is it will be something ai related
3755920	3762080	Hmm. Yeah, that's that sounds about right to me. Um, but within the context of internet writing, obviously, there's many disciplines there
3762640	3764640	economics being a prominent one
3764880	3766000	uh
3766000	3771440	When you split it up, is there a discipline in terms of I don't know people writing in terms of computer science concepts
3771440	3774160	Or people writing in terms of economic concepts. Who is today?
3775120	3779200	The discipline ceased to matter that really good internet writing is multi disciplinary
3779680	3784480	When I meet someone like a scott arinson who's doing like computer science ai type
3784880	3788400	Internet writing on his blog. I have way more in common with him
3789040	3792800	than with a typical research economist say at boston university
3793200	3794880	and it's not because
3794880	3798560	I know enough about computer science like I may or may not know a certain amount
3798800	3805040	But it's because our two enterprises are so similar or scott alexander. He writes about mental illness also
3805920	3807920	That just feels so similar
3807920	3811920	And we we really have to rethink what the disciplines are. It may be that method of writing
3812400	3818320	Is the key differentiator for this particular sphere. Yeah, it's got everything scott arinson was my professor in college
3818560	3820560	Oh, that's great. Yeah. Yeah
3820800	3824800	Um, that's where I decided i'm not going to go to grad school because you just see
3825520	3827920	Because you see like two standard deviations above you easily
3828320	3830480	Uh, you know, you might as well just choose a different game
3830880	3836720	But his method of thinking and writing is infectious like that of scott alexander and many of the rest of us. Yeah
3837520	3838800	um
3838800	3846000	So I think in the book you say you were raised as much by uh economic thought or the history of economic thought as you are
3846160	3849520	By your graduate training more much more not it's not even close
3850320	3853040	Today people would say I was talking to basal hopper and who's a
3853600	3858080	Young economist and he said he was raised on martial revolution in the same way that you were raised on the history of economic
3858080	3860080	Talk thought how do you?
3860720	3862560	Does this seem like a good trade?
3862560	3866880	Are you happy that people today are raised on scott alexander and martial revolution at the margin?
3866960	3869840	I would like to see more people raised on marginal revolution
3869920	3873680	I don't just mean that in a selfish way but the internet writing mode of thinking
3874080	3878000	I would like to see more economists and research scientists raised on it
3878400	3882080	But the number may be higher than we think like if I hadn't run emergent ventures
3882160	3885760	I wouldn't know about basal per se. Maybe you would not have met him
3886640	3887920	And it's infectious
3887920	3892320	So it might always be a minority, but it will be the people most likely to have new ideas
3892960	3897360	And it's a very powerful new mode of thought which I'll call internet way of writing and thinking
3898080	3902480	And it's not sufficiently recognized as something like a new field or discipline, but that's what it is
3903840	3907680	I wonder if you're doing enough of that when it comes to ai where I think you have really interesting thoughts about gpd
3907680	3912080	Five-level stuff, but this has somebody with your sort of polymathic understanding or different fields
3913040	3917440	If you just like extrapolate out these trends, I feel like you might have a lot of interesting thoughts about when you think
3917760	3920720	Just in terms of what might be possible with something much further down the line
3921440	3926880	Well, I have a whole book with ai predictions averages over and I have about 30 bloomberg columns
3927520	3932560	And probably 30 or 40 marginal revolution posts. I can just say I'll do more
3933360	3939280	Uh, but the idea at which ideas arrive at me is the binding constraint. I'm not holding them back
3940080	3946480	Um, speaking of basal, he had an interesting question. Should um, should should society
3947120	3952160	Uh, or government subsidize savings so that we're in effect having, uh,
3953280	3958720	It leads to basically a zero social discount rate. So it's people on average. I probably have, you know, uh,
3959520	3963360	The they're they're prioritizing their own lives. They have discount rates based on their own lives
3963760	3967040	Uh, if we're long term, I should the government be subsidizing savings
3967360	3973680	I'll come close to saying yes. First, we tax savings right now. So we should stop taxing savings. Absolutely
3974320	3978640	I think it's hard to come up with workable ways of subsidizing savings
3979120	3984640	That don't give rich people a lot of free stuff in a way that's politically unacceptable and also unfair
3985360	3988400	So i'm not sure we have a good way of subsidizing savings
3988880	3992400	But in principle, I would be for it if we could do it in the proper targeted manner
3993280	3999760	Although you had a good argument against this in stubborn attachments, right that over the long term if the if economic growth is high enough
3999760	4004480	Then the savings of the rich will just be, uh, dissipated to everybody below
4005360	4010960	Well, i'm not sure to whom it's dissipated. It does get dissipated the great fortunes of the past are mostly gone
4011760	4013760	But they may not go to people below
4014400	4020400	And the idea of writing into a tax system subsidies on that scale in essence subsidies to wealth
4020880	4027520	Not not gdp, but wealth is say six to eight times gdp. I just think the practical problems are quite significant
4027600	4029600	It's not an idea i'm pushing
4029600	4031920	But there may at margins be ways you can do it
4032880	4038320	That say only benefit uh people who are poor ways you can improve like the workings of
4038640	4045840	Local credit unions through better either regulation deregulation that are a kind of de facto subsidy without having to subsidize
4046320	4047840	All of the saved wealth
4047840	4050800	There's got to be a lot of ways you can do that and we should look for that more
4051360	4057440	Relatedly, uh, I think a couple years ago paul schlemming had an interesting paper that if you look from 1311 to now
4058240	4065440	Interest rates have been declining. There's been hundreds of years of interest rate declines. What what is the big picture explanation of this trend?
4066320	4071280	I'm not sure we have one. You may know cow and third law all propositions of real interest rates are wrong
4071680	4075440	But simply lower risk better information higher buffers of wealth
4076160	4078160	Would be what you'd call the intuitive
4078720	4081680	Economistic explanations. There's probably something to them
4082160	4088560	But how much of that trend do they actually explain as like a percent of the variance? I don't know. Hmm. Let's talk about anarchy
4089120	4093440	Yeah, you you you VV first about this. I hadn't read the last time we talked and they're really interesting
4093840	4095360	um, so
4095840	4098080	Maybe you can restate your arguments as you answer this question
4098400	4103280	But how much of your arguments about how network industries lead to these cartel like dynamics?
4103680	4108240	How much of that can help explain what happened to social media web 2.0?
4108880	4114880	I don't view that as such a cartel. I think there's a cartel at one level which is small but significant
4115840	4120560	This is maybe more true three four years ago than today with elan owning twitter and other changes
4120720	4123280	But if someone got kicked off social media platforms
4124000	4127760	Three four years ago. They would tend to get kicked off all or most of them
4128320	4130320	It wasn't like a consciously
4130880	4137440	Collusive decision, but it's a bit like oh, well, I know the guy who runs that platform and he's pretty smart and if he's worried
4137440	4139440	I should be worried
4139440	4141440	And that was very bad
4141440	4145760	I don't think it was otherwise such a collusive equilibria. Maybe some dimensions on hiring
4146800	4148480	Uh, social
4148480	4153120	You know people software engineers. There was some collusion not enough bidding
4153920	4156480	But it was mostly competing for attention
4157440	4163120	So I think the real risk protection agencies aside of network based collusion is through banking systems
4163600	4166080	Where you have clearing houses and payments networks
4166800	4172160	And to be part of it the clearing house in the absence of legal constraint can indeed
4172640	4177120	Help everyone collude and if you don't go along with the collusion you're kicked out of the payment system
4177920	4179920	That strikes me as a real issue
4180560	4186560	Do your arguments against anarchy do they apply it all to a web 3.0 crypto like stuff?
4188480	4194320	Do I think it will evolve into collusion? I don't see why it would I'm open to hearing the argument that it could though
4194480	4196480	What would that argument go like?
4197040	4199280	Well, I guess we did see with crypto that you have
4201360	4205680	In order to just have workable settlement you needed these centralized institutions
4206080	4210080	And from there you can get kicked off those and the government is involved with those and you can
4210880	4215680	You can maybe abstract the government away and say that they will need to collude in some sense in order to facilitate transactions
4215920	4218640	And the exchanges have ended up quite centralized, right? Yeah
4219200	4223520	Uh, and that's an example of clearing houses and exchanges being the vulnerable node
4223840	4227040	But I don't know how much web 3.0 is ever going to rely on that
4227680	4234160	It seems you can create new crypto assets more or less. It will there's the focality of getting them started
4235120	4240240	But if there's a real problem with the pre-existing crypto assets, I would think you could overcome that
4240560	4242800	So I would expect something more like a to and fro
4243440	4245760	waves of centralization decentralization
4246400	4250000	And natural checks embedded in the system. That's my intuition at least
4250320	4256160	Does your argument against anarchy prove too much in the sense that globally different nations have anarchic relations with each other?
4256560	4260560	And they can't uh, they can enforce coercive monopoly on each other
4260560	4264400	But they can coordinate to punish bad actors and the way you will do on protection agencies to do, right?
4264400	4269200	Like we can sanction North Korea together or something. I think that's a very good point and very good question
4269600	4271760	But I would rephrase my argument
4272000	4275600	You could say it's my argument against anarchy and it is an argument against anarchy
4275760	4279520	But it's also an argument that says anarchy is everywhere. So within government
4280240	4284480	Well the feds the state governments all the different layers of federalism. There's a kind of anarchy
4285040	4289760	There's not quite a final layer of adjudication the way you might think we pretend there is
4290240	4292880	I'm not sure how strong it is internationally, of course
4294000	4298320	Uh, you know how much gets enforced by hegemon how much is spontaneous order
4298720	4303920	Even the different parts of the federal government. They're in a kind of anarchy with respect to each other
4305040	4307040	So you need a fair degree of collusion
4307760	4313440	For things to work and you ought to accept that but maybe in a straussian way where you don't trumpet it too loudly
4313680	4322080	But the point that anarchy itself will evolve enough collusion to enable it to persist if it persists at all
4322800	4326480	Is my central point my point is like well anarchy isn't that different
4328160	4333280	Now given we've put a lot of social political capital into our current institutions
4334320	4336640	I don't see why you would press the anarchy button
4336960	4340720	But if I'm north korea and I can press the anarchy button for north korea
4341680	4344160	I get that it might just evolve into heyty
4344960	4350240	But I probably would press the anarchy button for north korea if at least someone would come in and control the loose nukes
4350480	4355200	Yeah, I this is related to one of those classic arguments against the anarchy that under anarchy anything is allowed
4355200	4358960	So the government is allowed therefore we're in a state of anarchy in some sense
4359520	4363760	In a funny way that argument's correct. We would revolve something like government
4364480	4368400	And heyty has done this but in very bad ways where it's our gangs and killings
4369040	4372800	It doesn't have to be that bad. There's medieval iceland medieval ireland
4373360	4375360	They had various forms of anarchy
4376080	4379040	Clearly limited in their destructiveness by low population
4379600	4381600	ineffective weapons
4381680	4384800	But they had a kind of stability you can't just dismiss them
4385520	4392480	And you can debate how governmental were they but the ambiguity of those debates is part of the point that every system has a lot of anarchy
4392800	4395680	And anarchy's have a fair degree of collusion if they survive
4396080	4400800	Oh, actually, so I want to go back to much earlier in the conversation where you're saying listen over
4402080	4406560	It seems like intelligence is is a net good. So just that being your heuristic you should
4407520	4408960	Call forth the ai
4408960	4412560	Well, not uncritically you need more argument, but just as a starting point
4412640	4417440	Yeah, it's like if more intelligence isn't going to help you you have some really big problems anyway
4417760	4422560	But I don't know if you still have the view that we're we have like an 800 year timeline for human civilization
4422560	4424560	But that that that sort of timeline implies that
4425200	4429360	Intelligence actually is going to be the because the thing the reason we have an 800 year timeline
4429920	4431920	Presumably is like some product of intelligence, right?
4433360	4439360	My worry is that energy becomes too cheap and people at very low cost can destroy things rather easily
4440880	4445760	So say if a nuclear if destroying a city with a nuclear weapon cost $50,000
4447600	4451920	What would the world look like I'm just not sure it might be more stable than we think
4452160	4458080	But I'm I'm greatly worried and I could readily imagine it falling apart. Yeah, but I guess the bigger point I'm making is that
4458560	4464000	Uh, in this case the reason the nuke got so cheap was uh because of intelligence
4464240	4466480	Now that that doesn't mean we should stop intelligence
4466560	4472000	But it just that if if that's like the end result of intelligence over hundreds of years that doesn't seem like intelligence is
4472400	4473920	always, uh
4473920	4478960	I'm not good. Well, we're doing better than the other great apes. I would say even though we face these really big risks
4479680	4482960	And in the meantime, we did incredible things. So that's a gamble I would take
4483440	4487120	But I believe we should view it more self-consciously as a sort of gamble
4487600	4492320	And it's too late to turn back the fundamental choice was one of decentralization
4492880	4496160	And that may have happened hundreds of millions or billions of years ago
4496800	4498800	And once you opt for decentralization
4499280	4501280	Intelligence is going to have advantages
4502000	4505840	And you're not going to be able to turn the clock back on it. So you're walking this tightrope
4506320	4508800	And by goodness you'd better do a good job
4509840	4512320	I mean we should frame our broader history more like that
4513120	4516160	And it has implications for how you think about x-risk again
4516160	4521760	I think if the x-risk x-risk people a bit of them, it's like well, I've been living in berkeley a long time and
4522240	4525040	It's it's really not that different my life's a bit better
4525760	4527760	And we can't risk all of this
4527840	4530000	But that's not how you should view broader history
4530480	4532880	I feel like you're an extras person you have a yeah
4532880	4536880	I mean even they don't think we're like a hundred percent guaranteed to go out by 800 years or something
4537120	4541920	No, I don't think we're guaranteed at all. It's up to us. I just think the risk not that everyone dies
4542080	4543280	I think that's quite low
4543280	4548960	But that we retreat to some kind of pretty chaotic form of like medieval balkan's existence
4549360	4552960	With a much lower population that seems to me quite a high risk
4553440	4556320	With or without ai it's probably the default setting
4559200	4561200	Given that you think that's a default setting I
4561360	4566800	Why is that not a big part of your when you're thinking about how new technologies are coming about?
4567440	4572400	Why why not consciously think in terms of is this getting us to the outcome where we avoid this sort of
4573120	4577040	A free industrial state that would result from the the $50,000 nukes
4577520	4583840	Well, if you think the risk is cheap energy more than ai per se admittedly ai could speed the path to cheap energy
4584720	4586720	It seems very hard to control
4587280	4594720	The strategy that's worked best so far is to have relatively benevolent nations become hegemon's and establish dominance
4595840	4598960	So it does influence me. I want the us uk
4599920	4604080	Some other subset of nations to establish dominance in ai it may not work forever
4604880	4607840	But in a decentralized world it sure beats the alternative
4608320	4615360	So a lot of the ai types they're too rationalist and they don't start with the premise that we chose a decentralized world a very very long time ago
4615520	4617520	even way before humans
4617760	4621920	And I think you made an interesting point when you were talking about canes in the book where you said
4622240	4625840	One of his faults was that he assumed that people like him would always be in charge
4626080	4626320	That's right
4626320	4629680	And I do see that also in the the alignment discourse like alignment is you know
4629760	4633040	If it's just handing over the government and just assuming the government does what you'd expect it to do
4633280	4635200	And I worry about this from my own point of view
4635200	4637680	So even if you think us is pretty benevolent today
4638000	4643360	Which is a highly contested and mixed proposition and i'm an american citizen pretty patriotic
4643760	4649680	But i'm fully aware of the long history of my government in killing and slaving doing other terrible things to people
4650560	4652560	And then you have to rethink
4652560	4655440	That over a long period of time it may be the worst
4656400	4660000	Time period that affects the final outcome even if the average is pretty good
4660320	4662320	And then if power corrupts
4662400	4666080	And if government even indirectly controls ai systems
4666080	4670000	So u.s. Government could become worse because it's a leader in ai right
4670720	4674800	But again, I've got to still take that over china or russia or
4675680	4677680	wherever else it might be
4678080	4680080	I just don't really understand
4680560	4686400	When people talk about national security, I've never seen the ai doomers say anything that made sense
4686800	4692800	And I recall those early days remember china issued that edict where they said we're only going to put ai's that are safe
4693040	4698560	And they can't criticize the ccp. How many super smart people and I mean super smart like zvi
4699440	4703520	Just jump on that and say c china's not going to compete with us. We can shut ai down
4704000	4708560	They just seem to have zero understanding of some properties of decentralized worlds
4709040	4711200	Or leesers tweet was it from yesterday?
4712480	4714000	Uh, I didn't think it was a joke
4714000	4718560	But oh, there's a problem that ai can read all the legal code and threaten us with all these penalties
4718800	4721840	It's like he has no idea how screwed up the legal system is
4722800	4727280	Hmm. Yeah, it would just need courtroom waits of like 70 or 700 years
4727600	4731760	It's not it wouldn't become a thing people are afraid of it would be a social problem in some way
4732400	4736000	What's your sense of how the government reacts when the labs are doing?
4736240	4739760	Uh, regardless of how they should react how they will react and when the labs are doing like, I don't know
4740160	4742160	10 billion dollar training runs and
4742560	4746560	If if under the premise that you know, these are powerful models not human level per se
4746560	4750160	But just they they can do all kinds of crazy stuff. How do you think the government's gonna?
4750960	4754560	Are they gonna nationalize the labs or how do you stay in washington? What's your sense?
4755360	4759600	I think our national security people are amongst the smartest people in our government
4760400	4765760	Uh, they're mostly well-intentioned in a good way. They're paying careful attention to many things
4767040	4770160	But what will be the political will to do what they don't control?
4770960	4776320	And my guess is until there's sort of an spf like incident which might even not be significant
4776400	4783360	But a headlines incident which spf was even if it doesn't affect the future evolution of crypto, which I guess is my view it won't
4784720	4786960	Until there's that we won't do much of anything
4787760	4790640	And then we'll have an spf like incident and we'll overreact
4790880	4796640	That seems a very common pattern in american history and the fact that it's a i the stakes might be high or whatever
4797440	4800400	I doubt if it will change the recurrence of that pattern
4801520	4804880	How would robert nozick think about different ai utopias?
4805680	4809280	Well, I think he did think about different ai utopias, right?
4810320	4812000	so uh
4812000	4816800	I believe he whether he wrote or talked about it, but the notion of humans much smarter
4817440	4823120	Than they are or the notion of aliens coming down who are like in some way morally intellectually way beyond us
4823520	4828160	He did write about that and he was worried about how they would treat us. So he was sensitive
4828960	4832320	To what you would call ai risk viewed a bit more broadly very early on
4833200	4835200	Hmm. What was his what was his take?
4835840	4838240	Well nozick is not a thinker of of takes
4838640	4842960	He was a thinker of speculations and multiple possibilities which I liked about him
4844000	4846000	He was worried about it this I know
4846880	4848880	And I talked to him about it
4849040	4851040	But I couldn't boil it down to a simple take
4852400	4858320	They made him a vegetarian I should add wait that made him oh because we want to be treating the the entities that are to us as
4859280	4862800	Aliens from outer space might treat us we are like that to animals
4863360	4868400	May not be a perfect analogy, but it's still an interesting point and therefore we should be vegetarians
4868720	4874800	That was his argument at least he felt he should be I wonder if we should honor past generations more or at least like respect their wishes
4874800	4877760	More for if we think of the the alignment problem
4877760	4881520	It's a similar to how we react to our previous generations
4881840	4886320	Do you know if we do we want uh the ai to treat us as we treat people thousands of years ago?
4886800	4888800	Yeah, it's a good question and uh
4889760	4893520	I've never met anyone who's consistent with how they view wishes of the dead. Yeah
4894080	4897920	I don't think there is a consistent philosophically grounded point of view on that one
4898640	4903280	Hmm. I guess the the sort of thomas pain viewer you don't regard them at all. Is that not self-consistent?
4903600	4906880	It's consistent, but I've never met anyone who actually lives according to it
4907600	4909600	Oh, and what's inside the contradicting themselves?
4909840	4916320	Well, say, you know, their their spouse were to die and the spouse gave them instructions. Sure. They would put weight on those instructions
4917280	4921120	Somewhere out there. There's probably someone who wouldn't but I've never met such a person
4921440	4924160	Hmm. And how about the burq view that you take them very seriously?
4924480	4928720	It why is that not self-consistent the birth view? What do you mean burq burq view? Oh?
4929360	4935280	Well, it's time inconsistent to take those preferences seriously and burq himself understood that he was a very deep thinker
4936000	4941040	So while you take them seriously now, but as time passes other ancestors come along
4941120	4945520	They have somewhat different views you have to keep on changing course what you should do now
4946160	4953200	Should it be what the ancestors behind us want or your best estimate of what the 30 or 40 years of ancestors to come
4953840	4955840	Will want once they have become ancestors
4956560	4963680	So it's time inconsistent. There's not again. There's not going to be a strictly philosophical resolution. There will be practical attempts
4964400	4966400	to find something sustainable
4966400	4974320	And that which survives will be that which we do and then we'll somewhat rationalize it exposed. Yeah. Yeah, there's an interesting book about
4975680	4980960	The ancient ancient Greeks. What was it called? I forgot the name, but it's talks about the hearts that they have for the
4981920	4984240	For their families where the the dead become gods
4984640	4987200	But then over time if you keep this heart going for hundreds of years
4987280	4991120	There's like thousands of ancestors that you didn't even remember their names, right? Who are you praying to?
4991920	4994880	And then it's like the arrow and possibility theorem for all the gods
4995440	4997120	What do they all mean too?
4997120	4999120	And you can't even ask them. Yeah
4999600	5004160	Okay, we were talking before we started recording about argentina and the reforms they're trying there
5005280	5008800	And they're trying to dollarize because the dollar is more stable than their currency
5008880	5012720	But this raises the question of why is the dollar so stable? So we're also democracy, right?
5012720	5018080	But like the dollar seems pretty well managed. What is the larger explanation of why?
5018800	5025280	Uh, the monetary policy seems well managed in the u.s. Well u.s. Voters hate inflation mostly for good reasons
5025760	5028560	And we have enough wealth that we can pay our bills
5029040	5033600	Without having to inflate very much and two percent has been stable now for quite a while
5034240	5039760	Now it's an interesting question, which I cannot answer and I have looked into this and I have asked smart people from argentina
5040320	5044720	Why does argentina in particular have recurring waves of hyperinflation?
5045680	5049200	Is there something about the structure of their interest groups that
5050160	5053840	Inevitably recurringly leads them to demand too much. I suppose
5054480	5057760	But there's plenty of poor badly run countries that don't have hyperinflation
5058160	5063760	African countries historically have not had high rates of hyperinflation haven't had high rates of inflation
5064880	5066160	Why is that?
5066160	5070800	Well, maybe they don't capture enough through senior age for some reason currency holdings aren't large enough
5071200	5073200	There's some kind of financial repression. I don't know
5073840	5079840	But it's very hard to explain why some of these countries, but not others go crazy with the printing press
5081760	5086400	And this is maybe a broader question about different institutions in the government where
5087440	5088960	I don't understand enough to
5088960	5090560	evaluate their like object level decisions
5090560	5094240	But if you look at the supreme court or the federal reserve or something just from a distance
5094240	5099280	It seems like they're really well run competent organizations with a highly technocratic, you know
5100080	5104400	Non-partisan people running them. They're not non-partisan, but they're still well run. Yeah, and
5105360	5109520	What's the theory of why these institutions in particular are so much better run?
5109520	5111520	Is it just that they are
5111680	5117840	They're one step back from direct elections is that they have traditions of knowledge within them. How do we think about this?
5117920	5119440	I think both of those
5119440	5125680	I don't think the elections point is sufficient because there's plenty of unelected bodies. They're totally corrupt. Yeah around the world
5125680	5127680	most of them are perhaps
5128080	5131520	Some sense of american civic virtue that gets communicated
5132160	5135600	And then the incentives are such say you're on the fed for a while
5136000	5138800	What you can do afterward can be rewarding
5139280	5141840	But you want a reputation for having done a good job
5142320	5145760	So your sense of morality and your private self-interest coincide
5146320	5151440	And that's pretty strong and we're still in that loop. I don't really see signs of that loop breaking
5152400	5156080	It's also striking to me how many times I'll read an interesting article or paper and
5156320	5159280	The person who wrote it's like the former head of the federal reserve in new york or something
5159520	5163760	It just seems like a this is strong indication of these institutions that the standards are very high
5163840	5170480	And if you speak with any of those people like who've been on fed boards ask them questions. They're super smart super involved curious
5171280	5174240	Uh, really for the most part do you want the best thing for their country?
5174880	5176880	Oh going back to these economists
5177120	5182000	You at the end you talk about how you're kind of uh disappointed in this sort of turn that economics has taken
5182000	5185280	Maybe I just I'm not surprised right? It's division of labor adam smith
5185680	5190240	Who said it would make people a bit feeble minded and incurious was completely correct
5191360	5195840	Wait adam smith said what would make people division of labor? I see right? Yeah, not stupid
5196560	5202000	You know current economic researchers probably have never been smarter, but they're way less broad and less curious
5202880	5204480	um
5204480	5210000	Patrick Ellison put it an interesting way where he said in the past maybe thinkers were more interested in
5210960	5212560	Delving into the biggest questions
5212560	5215600	But if they they couldn't do it rigorously in a tractable way
5215600	5220240	They would just they would make the trade-off in favor of the big question and today we make the opposite trade-off
5220480	5224800	How does that seem like a fair comparison? I think that's correct and I would add that saying the time of smith
5224880	5226880	There was nothing you could do rigorously
5226880	5230000	So there was no other option. Well, oh i'm gonna specialize and
5230560	5235200	You know memorizing all the grain prices and run some great econometrics on that and that'll be rigorous
5236160	5238160	It's really william stanley jevons
5238960	5243520	Who to the anglo world introduced this notion there's something else you can do that's rigorous
5244080	5248320	It was not yet rigorous, but he opened the door and showed people the alternative
5249280	5251280	Of the of the jevons paradox
5252240	5256080	Well, I would say his work in statistics originally on the value of money, right?
5256320	5260480	But his statistical work on call also had some rigors. So you're not wrong to cite them
5261920	5263920	And jevons just showed
5263920	5267680	That rigorous statistical work and economics could be the same thing
5268400	5271680	And that was his greater innovation than just marginalism
5272320	5274320	So he's an underrated figure
5274320	5276320	Maybe he should be in the book in a way
5276480	5281520	But it had some unfortunate secondary consequences too many people crowd into specialization
5282160	5287040	Crowd is a funny word to use because they reach sitting in their separate nodes, but it's a kind of crowding
5287520	5290560	Is there some sort of hyacin a solution here where?
5291200	5296720	Yeah, in markets the effect of having the sort of decentralized processes the the the sum is greater than the parts
5297120	5302800	Whereas in academic disciplines the sum is just a bunch of different statistical aggregates
5303200	5305680	Uh, there's no grand theory that comes together as a result of
5307120	5312720	All this micro work. Is there some hyacin solution here? Well, yes, you and I are the hyacin solution
5313040	5315200	That a specialist proliferate we can be
5315840	5321840	Quote-unquote parasitic on them and take what they do and turn it into interesting larger bundles that they haven't dreamt of
5322800	5327040	And make some kind of living doing that and we're much smaller in number
5327280	5330320	But i'm not sure how numerous we should be and there's a bunch of us, right?
5331120	5333120	You're just ever category titler
5333520	5335520	I'm running a podcast here
5340800	5345200	And what do you see as a future of the sort of uh, the kind of sort of thinking you do are
5345440	5349360	Are you do you see yourself as the last of the literary economist or is there a future of this kind of
5350080	5353120	Is it just going to be the slates our codex's are they going to take care of it or
5354320	5358320	This sort of lineage of thinking well the next me won't be like me
5358480	5363200	Yeah, in that sense i'm the last but i don't think it will disappear. It will take new forms
5363920	5365920	It may have a lot more to do with ai
5366800	5369600	And i don't think it's going to go away. There's just a demand for it
5370320	5377120	There's a real demand for our products. We have a lot of readers listeners people interested whatever and there'll be ways to monetize that
5378080	5380080	The challenge might be
5380480	5386400	Competing against ai and it doesn't have to be that ai does it better than you or i do without it might
5387040	5391040	But simply the people prefer to read what the ai's generate for 10 or 20 years
5391280	5396480	And it's harder to get an audience because playing with the ai's is a lot of fun. So that will be a real challenge
5396880	5400480	I think some of us will be up to it. You'll be faced with it more than i will be
5401600	5403920	Uh, but it's going to change a lot. Yeah, okay
5404640	5409040	Uh, one of the final things i want to do is i want to go into political philosophy a little bit
5409520	5411520	And uh, ask you
5414240	5422560	Okay, so i want to ask you about sort of certain potential weaknesses of the democratic capitalist model that we live in and in terms of
5423120	5427840	Both in terms of whether you think they're object level law wrong. Uh, sorry object level right and second
5428720	5429760	how
5429760	5433760	Regardless of how right they are how how um persuasive and how powerful
5434480	5439760	A force they will be against uh, our you know, our system of uh, uh government and functioning. Okay
5440640	5446480	Okay, so there's a libertarian critique that basically democracy is sort of a random walk with a drift toward socialism
5446560	5449040	And there's also a rashard effect where government programs don't go away
5449680	5451680	And so it just ends up towards socialism at the end
5452240	5455760	It ends up with having government that is too large. Yeah, but i
5456480	5458880	Don't see the evidence that it's wrote to serfdom
5459760	5463520	France sweden have had pretty big governments way too large in my opinion
5464080	5468240	But they haven't threatened to turn autocratic or totalitarian certainly not
5468880	5472960	And you've seen reforms in many of those countries sweden moved away from
5473600	5477360	Government approaching 70 percent of gdp and now it's quite manageable
5477840	5479840	Government there should be smaller yet
5480240	5485440	I don't think the trend is that negative. It's more of a problem with regulation and the administrative state
5486160	5489760	But we've shown an ability to create new sectors like big parts of tech
5490880	5495440	They're not unregulated laws apply to them, but they're way less regulated and it's a kind of race
5496320	5500240	Uh, that race doesn't look too bad to me at the moment like we could lose it
5501200	5507120	But uh, so far so good. So it the critique should be taken seriously, but it's yet to be validated. Hmm
5507680	5512000	Uh, how about the egalitarian critique from the left that you can't have
5512720	5517680	The inequality the market creates with the political and moral equality that the you know, humans deserve in demand
5518320	5520320	They just say that
5521280	5524000	US has high degree of income inequality. Yeah
5524720	5528160	Uh, so does brazil a much less well functioning society
5529040	5534240	Brazil continues on average. It will probably grow one or two percent. That's not a great record
5534800	5537840	But brazil has to go up in a puff of smoke. I don't see it
5538800	5544640	And how about the niche and critique and in the um, the end of history fukiyama says this is more powerful
5544880	5547760	This is the one he's more worried about than the more more so than the leftist critique
5547920	5548800	Over time
5548800	5553040	Basically what you end up with is the last man and you can't defend the civilization. You know the story
5553200	5557760	It's a lot of words. I mean, is he short the market? I've asked fukiyama this
5558240	5561360	He's not this is a long time ago, but he wasn't short the market then
5562560	5564560	Again, it's it's a real issue
5564640	5567920	It seems to me the problems of today for the most part
5568560	5571520	Are more manageable than the problems of any previous era
5572400	5574400	We still you know might all go poof
5575040	5578480	Return to medieval Balkan style existence in a millennia or whatever
5579440	5585280	But it's a fight and we're totally in the fight and we have a lot of resources and talent. So like let's do it
5586800	5589280	Okay, I don't see why that particular worry
5589840	5591840	It's it's a lot of words
5592320	5595440	And I like to get very concrete like even if you're not short the market
5595520	5599360	If that were the main relevant worry, where would that show up in asset prices?
5599440	5601840	It's a cot worse. It's a very concrete question
5602000	5607760	I think it's very useful to ask and when people don't have a clear answer. I get worried. Where does your prediction that?
5609360	5612960	Hundreds of years down the line will have the $50,000 nukes. Where does that show up in the asset prices?
5613440	5617200	I think at some point vix, you know an index of volatility will go up
5618160	5623040	Uh, probably not soon nuclear proliferation has not gone crazy, which is wonderful
5623840	5628160	But I think at some point it's hard to imagine it not getting out of control
5628800	5634320	Um, last I read vix is surprisingly low and stable. That's right. I think 2024 is on
5634960	5636960	On the path to be a pretty good year
5636960	5642240	Yeah, or do you think the market is just wrong in terms of thinking about both geopolitical risk from, you know, israel or whatever
5642240	5644240	I don't think the market's wrong at all. I think
5644480	5648480	That war will converge. I'm not saying the humanitarian outcome is a good one
5648720	5653120	But in terms of the global economy, I think markets are thinking rationally about it
5653360	5655600	Though the rational forecast of course is often wrong
5656240	5661760	What's your sense on the scaling stuff when you look at the arguments? Uh, in the terms of what's coming? How do you react to that?
5662160	5664160	Well, your piece on that was great
5664480	5667760	I don't feel I have the expertise to judge that as a technical matter
5668080	5673840	It does seem to me intuitively it would be weird on the technical side if scaling just stopped working
5674160	5679520	But on the knowledge side, I think people underestimate possible barriers and what I have in mind is
5680160	5684880	Quite a bit of reality the universe might in some very fundamental way simply not be legible
5685680	5690800	And that there's no easy and fruitful way to just quote unquote apply more intelligence to the problem
5691280	5694640	Like oh, you want to integrate general relativity and quantum mechanics
5695200	5700720	It may just be we've hit the frontier and there's not a final layer of oh here's how it fits together
5700960	5703520	So there's no way to train in ai or other thing
5704160	5708160	To make it smarter to solve that and maybe a lot of the world is like that
5709360	5713680	And that to me people are not taking seriously enough. So I'm not sure what the net returns will be
5714320	5715200	to
5715200	5717200	bigger and better and smarter ai
5717760	5723200	That seems possible for you know, p versus np type of reasons. It's just like harder to make uh for further discoveries
5723600	5724560	but
5724560	5728080	I feel like we have pretty good estimates in terms of like the declining
5729120	5732960	A researcher productivity because of low hanging fruit being gone in this sort of sense
5733440	5735440	of we're reaching the frontier and
5735680	5740160	Whatever percent it is a year if you can just keep the ai population growing faster than that
5740240	5745840	If you just want to be crude about it that seems enough to if not get to the ultimate physical synthesis
5745840	5751040	At least much broader than where human civilization would get in the same span of time. That seems very plausible
5751360	5754400	I think we'll get further. I expect big productivity gains
5754960	5759840	As a side note, I'm less convinced by the declining researcher productivity argument than I used to be
5760560	5766640	So the best way to measure productivity for an economist is wages and wages of researchers haven't gone down
5767920	5771840	Period in fact, they've gone up. No, they may not be producing new ideas
5771840	5777680	You might be paying them to be functionaries or to manage pr or does this manage other researchers?
5778400	5782740	But I think that's a worry that we have a lot more researchers
5783520	5784320	with
5784320	5791600	Generally rising researcher wages and that hasn't boosted productivity growth. China, india, south korea brought into the world economy
5792080	5794080	scientific talent
5794400	5798960	It's better than if we hadn't done it, but it hasn't in absolute terms boosted productivity growth
5799200	5801200	And maybe that's a worrisome sign
5801360	5804320	Uh on on the metric of researcher wages
5804720	5808320	It seems like it could just be a fact that even the even the
5809200	5813120	Less marginally useful improvements are worth the extra cost in terms of if you think of a company
5813440	5816960	Like google is probably paying as engineers a lot more than it was paying in the early days
5817040	5819200	Even though they're doing less now because you know
5819520	5823680	Changing a pixel in the the new google page is going to affect billions of users
5824000	5830160	The similar thing could be happening in the economy, right? That might hold for google researchers, but take people in pharma biomedicine
5831520	5833520	There's a lot of private sector
5833520	5837120	Financed research or indirectly financed by buying up smaller companies
5837680	5841040	And it only makes sense if you get something out of it that really works
5841600	5845120	Like a good vaccine or a good medication ozempic super profitable
5846080	5849680	So wages for biomedical researchers in general haven't gone down
5851040	5853040	Now finally it's paying off
5853600	5858480	But i'm not sure ai will be as revolutionary as the other ai optimists believe
5858880	5862320	I do think it will raise productivity growth in ways which are visible
5863280	5865280	To what extent?
5866160	5869280	In the conventional agro story you think in terms of population size, right?
5869280	5872960	And then so you just increase the population size you get much more research at the other end
5873280	5877120	To what extent doesn't make sense to think about well, if you have these billions of ai copies
5877920	5880800	We can think of that in terms of as a proxy of how much progress they could
5881680	5887600	Produce is that a not a sensible way to think about that at some point having billions of copies probably won't matter
5887920	5893520	It will matter much more. How good is the best thing we have and how well integrated is it
5893920	5896560	Into our other systems which have bottlenecks of their own
5897520	5901440	And the principles governing the growth of that are much harder to discern
5901680	5904640	It's probably a much slower growth than just juicing up
5904800	5907920	Oh, we've got a lot of these things and they're trained on more and more gpu's
5908800	5914240	But precisely because the top seems to matter so much is why we might expect bigger gains, right?
5914240	5916800	So if you think about jews in the 20th century
5917520	5920640	You know two percent of the population are less than that and 20 percent of the noble prizes
5920880	5923440	It does seem like you can have a much bigger impact than
5924320	5926320	If you're on the very tail if you just have
5926400	5928400	Just a few hundred john von neumann copies
5928720	5934160	Maybe that's a good analogy that the impact of ai will be like in the 20th century the impact of jews, right?
5934720	5937520	Which would be excellent, right? Yeah, but it's not
5938240	5943440	Extraordinary, it's not a science fiction novel. It is. I mean you read the early 20th century stuff as you have
5943520	5948960	You know, it's like a slow takeoff right there of like, you know, go from v2 rockets to the moon and a couple of decades
5949360	5953840	It's it's kind of a crazy pace of change. Yeah, that's what I think it will be like again
5953920	5958960	Great stagnation is over. We'll go back to those earlier rates of change transform a lot of the world
5959840	5961840	Mostly a big positive a lot of chaos
5962400	5965680	Disrupted institutions along the way. That's my prediction
5966320	5971440	But no one writes a science fiction novel about the 20th century. It feels a bit ordinary still
5972320	5978400	Hmm. Yeah, even though it wasn't I forget the name of the philosopher you asked this to but the the feminist philosopher you asked the question
5978560	5979920	Amiya Srinivasan
5979920	5983760	You asked the question what would have to be different for you to be a social conservative, right?
5984160	5987040	What would have to be different for you to not be a tumor per se?
5987040	5989040	But just one of these people who like
5989040	5992160	This is the main thing to be thinking about during this period of history or something like that
5992400	5994880	Well, I think it is one of the main things we should be thinking about
5995520	5998880	But I would say if I thought international cooperation
5999520	6001040	Were very possible
6001040	6002480	I would at least
6002480	6004640	Possibly have very different views than I do now
6005360	6011680	Or if I thought no other country could make progress on AI those seem unlikely to me, but they're not logically impossible
6012320	6013360	so
6013360	6016240	The fundamental premise where I differ from a lot of the doomers
6016960	6021200	Is my understanding of a decentralized world and its principles being primary
6021840	6024960	Their understanding is some kind of comparison like here's the little people
6025360	6027920	And here's the big monster and the big monster gets bigger
6028160	6032480	And even if the big monster does a lot of good things, it's just getting bigger and here are the little people
6033200	6034800	That's a possible framework
6034800	6039600	But if you start with decentralization and competition and well, how are we going to manage this?
6041680	6044400	In some ways my perspective might be more pessimistic
6046080	6050240	But you you don't just think you can wake up in the morning and like legislate safety
6050560	6052560	Hmm
6054000	6059600	You look at the history of relative safety having come from hegemon's and you hope your hegemon stays good enough
6060480	6065360	Which is a deeply fraught proposition. I recognize that. Hmm. What's the next book?
6066640	6072560	I'm already writing it. Uh part of it is on jevons, but the title is the marginal revolution
6074000	6079120	But not about the blog about the actual marginal. Yeah, but it's maybe a monograph like 40 000 words
6079920	6082480	But I don't think book length should matter anymore
6083360	6085360	I want to be more radical on that
6085440	6089360	I think 40 000 words is perfect because it would actually fit in context. So when you do the gpd4
6091280	6095280	Now context may be bigger by then. Yeah, but I want to have it in
6096000	6099200	GPT in some way or whatever is replaced it. Hmm
6100320	6102960	Okay, uh, those are all the questions I had tell her this is a lot of fun
6103600	6108400	And uh, keep up the great work and uh, delighted you're at it. Thank you. Thank you. Uh, yeah
