1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,040
I challenge the claim that next token prediction cannot

2
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:08,560
surpass human performance. It looks like on the surface, it

3
00:00:08,560 --> 00:00:11,920
cannot. It looks on the surface, if you just learn to

4
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:16,320
imitate, to predict what people do, it means that you can only

5
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:20,240
copy people. But there here is a counter argument for why it

6
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:24,240
might not be quite so if your neural net is, if your base

7
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:27,520
neural net is smart enough, you just ask it like, what would

8
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:31,200
what would a person with like great insight and wisdom and

9
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:35,200
capability do? Maybe such a person doesn't exist. But there's

10
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:37,520
a pretty good chance that the neural net will be able to

11
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:41,840
extrapolate how such a person would behave. Do you see what I

12
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:42,160
mean?

13
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:44,640
Yes, although where would it get the sort of insight about

14
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:48,240
what that's a person would do, if not from from the data of

15
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:50,240
regular people? Because like, if you think about it, what does

16
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:54,160
it mean to predict the next token well enough? What does it

17
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:56,160
mean? Actually, it's actually it's a much it's a deeper

18
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:59,280
question than it seems. Predicting the next token well

19
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:07,120
means that you understand the underlying reality that led to

20
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:11,840
the creation of that token. It's not statistics like it is

21
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:16,080
statistics, but what is statistics? In order to on to

22
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:18,720
understand those statistics to compress them, you need to

23
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:23,200
understand what is it about the world that creates this those

24
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:26,080
statistics. And so then you say, Okay, well, I have all those

25
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:28,640
people. What is it about people that creates their behaviors?

26
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:31,520
Well, they have, you know, they have thoughts and they have

27
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:34,080
feelings and they have ideas and they do things in certain

28
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:38,720
ways. All of those would be deduced from next token

29
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:43,360
prediction. And I'd argue that this should make it possible,

30
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:47,200
not indefinitely, but to a to a pretty decent degree to say

31
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:50,080
well, can you guess what you what you do if you took a person

32
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:52,800
with like this characteristic and that characteristic, like

33
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:56,560
such a person doesn't exist. But because you're so good at

34
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:58,720
predicting the next token, you should still be able to guess

35
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:03,280
what that person would do this hypothetical imaginary person

36
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:08,960
means far greater mental ability than the rest of us.
