00:00.000 --> 00:04.080
The videos were really inspiring like you're the reason I'm like going into grad school

00:04.080 --> 00:08.600
And there's this little bell in the back of my mind. It's like do I want that?

00:09.600 --> 00:14.080
To get more people going into math PhDs math Academy of Finance and

00:14.800 --> 00:18.360
Computer science almost certainly have an overallocation of talent

00:18.360 --> 00:25.040
I actually I'm quite determined at some point to like be a high school math teacher for some number of years math lends itself to

00:25.600 --> 00:28.280
Synthetic data how AlphaGo is trained you could have it

00:28.760 --> 00:34.800
Produce a lot of proofs and just train on a whole bunch of those and the thing that takes at most 30 minutes of the teacher's time

00:34.800 --> 00:37.080
maybe even 30 seconds has these

00:37.800 --> 00:43.360
Completely monumental rippling effects for the life of the student they were talking to that then sets them on this whole different trajectory

00:44.520 --> 00:50.680
Okay today, I have the pleasure of interviewing Grant Sanderson of the YouTube channel through blue one brown

00:50.760 --> 00:57.440
You all know who grant is I'm really excited about this one by the time that an AI model can get gold in the

00:57.560 --> 01:05.080
International Math Olympiad is that just a GI given the amount of creative problem solving and chain of thought required to do that I

01:06.160 --> 01:09.520
To be honest have no idea what people mean when they use the word a GI

01:09.520 --> 01:12.520
Yeah, I think if you ask ten different people like what they mean by it

01:12.520 --> 01:18.160
You're gonna get ten slightly different answers and it seems like what people want to get it is a

01:18.480 --> 01:25.080
Discrete change that I don't think actually exists. We've got okay AI is up to a certain point. They're not a GI

01:25.080 --> 01:27.080
They might be really smart, but it's not a GI

01:27.440 --> 01:31.680
And then after some point that's the benchmark when like now there now. It's generally intelligent

01:32.240 --> 01:35.880
The reason that world model doesn't really fit is it feels a lot more continuous where

01:37.320 --> 01:42.040
You know gpd4 feels general in the sense that you have one training algorithm

01:42.160 --> 01:48.000
That applies to a very very large set of different kinds of tasks that someone might want to be able to do and that's cool

01:48.000 --> 01:54.760
That's like an invention that people in the 60s might not have expected to be true for the nature of how artificial intelligence can be

01:55.040 --> 02:02.240
Programmed so it's it's generally intelligent, but maybe what people mean by oh, it's not a GI is you've got certain benchmarks where

02:02.240 --> 02:06.000
You know, it's better than most people at some things, but it's not better at most people than others

02:06.240 --> 02:08.400
You know at this point, it's better than most people at math

02:08.880 --> 02:15.000
You know it's better than most people at solving AMC problems and like Imo problems is just not better than the best

02:15.000 --> 02:18.520
And so maybe at the point when it's getting golds in the Imo

02:19.040 --> 02:23.840
That's a sign that okay. It's it's as good as the best and we've ticked off another domain

02:23.960 --> 02:25.280
but

02:25.280 --> 02:31.760
I don't know like it is what you mean by a GI that you've you've enumerated all the possible domains that something could be good at

02:31.760 --> 02:36.200
And now it's better than humans at all of them or enough that it could take over

02:36.840 --> 02:38.680
substantial fractions of

02:38.680 --> 02:43.520
You know human jobs or something where right now it's it's it's impressive

02:43.520 --> 02:48.080
But it's not gonna be even 1% of GDP, but in my mind if it's getting gold in Imo

02:48.080 --> 02:51.120
I mean having seen some of those problems from your channel

02:51.120 --> 02:53.240
I'm I'm thinking wow, that's that's really coming after our

02:53.800 --> 02:56.160
Podcasters and video animators. I don't know

02:56.160 --> 03:01.120
I don't know that feels orthogonal because getting a gold in the Imo feels a lot more like being really really good at

03:01.120 --> 03:05.320
Go or chess like those those feel analogous. Well, it's it's super creative

03:05.320 --> 03:08.920
Like I think anyone I don't I don't know chess as well as the people are into it

03:08.920 --> 03:14.800
But everything that I hear from them the sort of moves that are made and choices have all of the air of creativity

03:15.000 --> 03:19.120
I think as soon as they started generating artwork than everyone else could appreciate

03:19.120 --> 03:24.640
Oh, there's there's something that deserves to be called creative here and the creative side of the math

03:24.640 --> 03:29.960
You know, I'm I don't know how it would look when people get them to be getting golds at the Imo

03:29.960 --> 03:31.320
but I imagine

03:31.320 --> 03:36.680
It's something that looks a little bit like how alpha go is trained where you have it like play with itself a whole bunch

03:36.680 --> 03:38.840
You know math lends itself to

03:39.400 --> 03:43.040
Synthetic data in the ways that a lot of other domains don't you could have it

03:43.560 --> 03:49.080
Produce a lot of proofs in a proof-checking language like lean for example and just train on a whole bunch of those and like is this

03:49.080 --> 03:52.360
A valid proof is this not a valid proof and then counterbalance that with

03:52.800 --> 03:59.560
English written versions of something and so I imagine what it looks like once you get something that is solving these Imo level things

04:00.080 --> 04:03.760
One of one of two things either it writes a very good proof

04:04.240 --> 04:10.240
That you feel like is unmotivated because anyone who reads math papers has this feeling that there are there two types

04:10.240 --> 04:16.040
There's the ones where you morally understand why the result should be true and then there's the ones where you like I can follow the steps

04:16.440 --> 04:18.040
Why would you have come up with that?

04:18.040 --> 04:22.960
I don't know but I guess that shows that the result is true and you you're left wanting something a little bit more

04:22.960 --> 04:27.160
And so you could imagine if it produces that on the gold to get a gold in the Imo

04:27.160 --> 04:32.160
Is that the same kind of ability as what is required to replace jobs?

04:32.760 --> 04:40.200
Just like not really like the the impediments between where it is now and replacing jobs feels like a whole different set of things like

04:40.440 --> 04:47.560
Having a context window that is a longer than you know some small things such that you can make connections over long periods of time and build

04:47.720 --> 04:52.640
Relationships and understand where someone's coming from and the actual problem-solving part of it

04:52.640 --> 04:55.960
I mean, it's a sign that it would be a more helpful tool

04:55.960 --> 05:00.840
But in the same way that like Mathematica can help you solve math problems much more effectively

05:01.240 --> 05:06.960
Tell me why I should be less amazed by it or maybe put in a different context for the reason I would be very impressed is

05:07.280 --> 05:13.000
That with chess or something obviously this is not all the chess programs are doing

05:13.000 --> 05:18.240
but there's a level of research you can do to narrow down the possibilities and more importantly

05:18.640 --> 05:23.920
The in the math example, it seems that with some of the examples you've elicited on your channel

05:23.920 --> 05:29.680
For example, the ability to solve the problem is so dependent on coming up with the right

05:30.080 --> 05:32.080
abstraction to think about it coming up with

05:33.040 --> 05:40.120
Ways of thinking all the problems that are not evident in the problem itself or in any other problem in any other test that seems different from

05:41.240 --> 05:43.040
Just a chess game where you don't have to like

05:43.040 --> 05:48.520
Well, what is the largest structure of this chess game in the same way as you do with the IML problem?

05:48.520 --> 05:54.840
I think you should ask people who know a lot about go and chess and I'd be curious to hear their opinions on it because I

05:55.280 --> 06:01.040
Imagine what they would say is if you're gonna be as good at go as Alpha go is you're also not doing tree search

06:01.080 --> 06:05.640
At least exclusively it's not dependent on something as both in that because you get this combinatorial

06:06.080 --> 06:09.600
Explosion, which is why people thought that game would be so much harder for so much longer

06:09.800 --> 06:16.040
There sort of has to be something like a higher level structure in their understanding and then don't get me wrong

06:16.040 --> 06:20.400
I would be super impressed and like anticipate being very impressed when you get

06:20.640 --> 06:25.320
AI's that can solve these IMO problems because you're absolutely right

06:25.320 --> 06:28.640
There's a level of creativity involved. The only claim I'm making is that

06:29.280 --> 06:35.960
Being able to do that feels distinct from the impediments between I don't know where we are now and the

06:36.440 --> 06:38.560
AI's take over all of our jobs or something

06:38.560 --> 06:41.640
It just it seems like it's gonna be another one of those boxes

06:41.640 --> 06:50.000
That's it's this historic moment analogous to chess and go more so than it's good to be analogous to the industrial revolution

06:50.560 --> 06:53.440
I'm surprised you wouldn't be more compelled

06:54.440 --> 06:57.440
Compilled right or just you don't think that skill of

06:58.440 --> 07:02.880
This problem is isomorphic to this completely different way of thinking about what's happening in the situation

07:02.880 --> 07:07.400
And here's me going through the 50 steps to put all that together into this one proof

07:07.400 --> 07:12.040
I'm surprised don't think that's upstream of a lot of valuable tasks

07:12.040 --> 07:16.840
I think it's a similar level of how impressed I was with

07:17.320 --> 07:21.960
the stable diffusion type stuff where you know you ask it give me a

07:22.640 --> 07:29.240
Landscape of beautiful mountains, but made out of like quartz and gemstones or something and it gives you this thing which

07:29.640 --> 07:34.340
Has all of the essence of a landscape, but it's not literally a landscape and so you realize okay

07:34.340 --> 07:38.460
There's something something beyond the literal that's understood here

07:38.460 --> 07:42.560
I'm like that's very impressive and in the same way to solve one of these math problems that requires creativity

07:42.560 --> 07:45.240
You can't just go from the definitions. You're 100% right

07:45.240 --> 07:49.480
you need this element of lateral thinking which is why we find so much joy in

07:50.160 --> 07:53.600
Finding the solutions ourselves or even just seeing other people get those solutions

07:53.720 --> 08:00.480
It's exactly the kind of joy that you get out of good artistic analogies and comparisons and mixing and matching

08:00.480 --> 08:05.040
I'm very impressed by all of that. It's just I think it's in the same category and it's

08:05.520 --> 08:11.600
Maybe I don't have the same opinions as a lot of other people with this hard line between there's pre-AGI and post-AGI

08:11.720 --> 08:14.200
Like I just don't know what they mean by the word AGI

08:14.240 --> 08:21.160
And I don't think that you're gonna have something that's this measurable discrete step much less that a math tournament is gonna be

08:21.160 --> 08:25.040
An example of what that discrete step would look like interesting interesting

08:25.600 --> 08:31.200
Okay applied mathematicians, okay, where do we put them in society where they can have the biggest benefit?

08:31.200 --> 08:33.720
we like a lot of them go into computer science and IT and

08:34.880 --> 08:36.560
I'm sure there's been lots of benefits there

08:36.560 --> 08:41.880
But we're you know where are there are parts of society where you just have a whole bunch of mathematicians go in and they can make

08:41.880 --> 08:46.480
Things a lot better, you know, I don't know transportation or logistics or manufacturing

08:46.480 --> 08:49.960
But where else do you think they might be useful? That's such a good question in some ways?

08:49.960 --> 08:51.960
I'm like the worst person to ask about that

08:52.320 --> 08:53.960
This isn't gonna answer your question

08:53.960 --> 08:57.320
But instead is gonna like fan the flames of why I feel it's an important question

08:57.320 --> 09:02.080
I have actually been thinking recently about if it's worth making an out-of-typical video

09:02.440 --> 09:08.120
That's specifically addressed it like and inspiring people to ask that especially students who are graduating because I think

09:08.520 --> 09:14.680
This thing happens where when you fall in love with math or some sort of technical field by default in school

09:14.680 --> 09:17.320
You you study that and when you're studying that

09:18.200 --> 09:19.160
effectively

09:19.160 --> 09:23.600
You're going through an apprenticeship to be an expert in that or a researcher in that

09:23.600 --> 09:28.960
You know the structure of studying physics in a university or math in a university even though they know that not all majors are gonna go

09:28.960 --> 09:30.040
Into the field

09:30.040 --> 09:34.920
The people that you're gaining mentorship from are academics and our research is in the field

09:34.920 --> 09:37.200
So it's hard not to effectively be apprenticing in that

09:37.800 --> 09:43.040
And I also have noticed that when I go and give talks at universities or things like this and

09:43.680 --> 09:47.080
Students come up after and they're like saying hi. There's a lot of them like grand

09:47.560 --> 09:51.600
The videos were really inspiring like you're the reason that I studied math or that you're the reason

09:51.600 --> 09:56.440
I'm like going into grad school and there's this little bell in the back of my mind. That's like cool cool

09:56.440 --> 10:00.280
I'm amazed. I don't know if I believe I was wholly responsible for it, but like cool to have that impact

10:00.880 --> 10:02.880
Do I want that?

10:03.160 --> 10:08.280
Is this a good thing to get more people going into math PhDs on the one hand

10:08.280 --> 10:12.480
I unequivocally want more people to self-identify as liking math. That's very good

10:12.480 --> 10:18.500
But that those who are doing that necessarily get shuffled into the traditional outlets like math academia

10:19.000 --> 10:22.280
Yeah, I think you highlighted very right. It's like math academia finance and

10:23.000 --> 10:25.500
Computer science data science something in there in general

10:26.000 --> 10:31.760
Are very common things to go to and as a result they almost certainly have an overallocation of talent

10:32.240 --> 10:34.000
All three of those are valuable, right?

10:34.000 --> 10:36.320
I'm not saying like those are not valuable things to go into

10:36.560 --> 10:42.000
But if you were playing God and like shifting around where do you want people to go again?

10:42.080 --> 10:43.720
I'm not answering your question

10:43.720 --> 10:46.200
I'm just asking it in other words because I don't really know

10:46.200 --> 10:50.920
I think you should probably talk to the people who made that shift of which there aren't a huge number

10:50.920 --> 10:53.920
But like Eric Lander is maybe one good example

10:55.400 --> 11:01.160
Jim Simons would maybe be another whereas people who were doing a very purely academic thing

11:01.160 --> 11:03.480
And then decided to shift to something very different

11:04.280 --> 11:08.200
now I have sort of had this thought that it's very beneficial to

11:08.800 --> 11:14.600
Insert some forcing function that gets the pure mathematicians to spend some of their time in a non-pure math setting

11:14.600 --> 11:15.360
you know

11:15.360 --> 11:17.360
NSF grants coming with a a

11:17.880 --> 11:23.120
Requirement that 10% of your time goes towards a collaboration with another department or something like that

11:23.480 --> 11:30.440
The thought being these are really good problem solvers and a specific category of problems and to just distribute that talent elsewhere

11:30.440 --> 11:36.040
Might be helpful and when I when I like run this by mathematicians. Sometimes there's a mixed response for the like

11:37.040 --> 11:40.320
I don't know if we'd be all that useful like there's a sense that the

11:40.680 --> 11:48.160
Aesthetic of what constitutes a good math problem is by its nature rooted in the purity of it such that it's maybe a little

11:48.440 --> 11:54.120
Elitist to assume that just because people are really really good at solving that kind of problem that somehow their

11:54.640 --> 11:57.480
Abilities are more generalizable than other people's abilities

11:57.480 --> 12:03.160
You know why ask about the applied mathematicians rather than saying like shouldn't the applied biologists go and work in

12:03.440 --> 12:09.360
Logistics and things like that because they also have a set of problem-solving abilities. That's maybe generalizable the back of my mind

12:09.360 --> 12:11.360
I think no, but the mathematicians are

12:11.600 --> 12:13.600
Really is something general about math

12:14.560 --> 12:16.560
so I

12:16.720 --> 12:17.880
Don't have the answers

12:17.880 --> 12:24.120
I will say I'm actually very curious to hear from people for what they think the right answers are or from people who made that switch

12:24.120 --> 12:27.800
Let's say they were a math major or or something adjacent like computer science physics

12:27.800 --> 12:31.880
And then they decided that they wanted to pour themselves into something not because

12:32.280 --> 12:38.360
That was the academic itch that scratched that they were scratching by being good at school and getting to appreciate that

12:38.360 --> 12:41.400
But because they stepped back and said what impact do I want to make on the world?

12:42.520 --> 12:46.920
I'm hungry for more of those stories because I think it could be very compelling to

12:47.480 --> 12:51.880
convey those specifically to my audience who is probably

12:52.760 --> 12:58.840
On track to go into just the traditional math type fields and maybe there's room to have a little bit of influence to disperse them more

12:59.000 --> 13:03.360
Effectively, but I don't know. I don't know what more effectively looks like because at the end of the day

13:03.360 --> 13:06.640
I'm like I'm a math youtuber, right? I'm not someone who

13:07.480 --> 13:14.280
Has a career in logistics or manufacturing or all of these things in such a way that I can have an in-tune feel for where is there a

13:15.520 --> 13:19.440
need for this specific kind of abstract problem-solving it might be useful to

13:20.320 --> 13:21.920
speculate on how

13:21.920 --> 13:27.040
An undergrad or somebody who's a young math whiz might even begin to contemplate

13:27.360 --> 13:33.040
Here's where I can have an edge. I'm remembering actually it just occurred to me a former podcast guest Lars Dusset

13:33.560 --> 13:36.760
he was a game designer actually and he

13:37.960 --> 13:42.080
Started learning about Georgism, which is this idea that you should tax land and only land

13:42.080 --> 13:46.040
And so he got really interested in not only writing about those ideas

13:46.040 --> 13:51.200
But also with well if you're gonna tax land you had to figure out what the value of land is

13:51.200 --> 13:52.560
I mean, how do you figure out the value of land?

13:52.560 --> 13:59.440
There's all these algorithms of how you do this optimally based on neighboring land and how to average across land and

13:59.560 --> 14:01.560
There's a lot of intricacies there

14:01.560 --> 14:08.000
And so he he now has a start-up where he just contracts with cities to implement these

14:08.280 --> 14:12.280
Algorithms to help them assess the value of their land which makes property taxes much more feasible

14:12.520 --> 14:15.880
You know just that's another example right where the motivation was more philosophical

14:15.880 --> 14:19.040
But his specialty as a technical person helped them

14:19.600 --> 14:22.520
You know how to make a contribution there. I think that's perfect

14:22.680 --> 14:27.840
Probably the true answer is that you're not gonna give a universal thing for any individual

14:27.840 --> 14:33.840
It's gonna be based on where their life circumstances connect them into something either because they he had an interest in

14:33.840 --> 14:37.080
Georgism for whatever reason, but if someone I don't know their

14:37.240 --> 14:43.520
Their dad runs a paper mill and they're like connected to the family business in that way and realize they can like plug themselves in a little bit

14:43.520 --> 14:48.040
More efficiently you you're gonna have this wide diversity of the ways that people are applying themselves

14:48.360 --> 14:52.960
That does not take the form of general advice given from some podcast somewhere

14:52.960 --> 14:59.600
But instead takes the form of simply inviting people to like think critically about the question rather than following the momentum of

14:59.800 --> 15:02.600
What being good at school implies about your future?

15:03.080 --> 15:04.960
We were talking about this before the interview started

15:04.960 --> 15:12.200
but we have a much better grasp on reality based on our mathematical tools and I'm not talking about anything advanced literally just it will

15:12.200 --> 15:13.960
being able to count and

15:13.960 --> 15:17.240
In the decimal system that even the Romans didn't have

15:17.600 --> 15:24.440
How likely do you think it is that something that significant would be enjoyed by descendants in hundreds or thousands of years?

15:24.440 --> 15:27.480
Or do you think that that kind of basic numeracy level stuff?

15:28.080 --> 15:32.840
Those kinds of thinking tools are basically all gone just so I understand the question right you're talking about how

15:33.440 --> 15:35.440
Having a system for numbers

15:35.800 --> 15:42.040
Changes the way that we think that then lends itself to a better understanding of the world like we can do commerce. Yeah, exactly

15:42.760 --> 15:44.760
Or we can think in terms of orders of magnitude

15:44.760 --> 15:50.400
Yeah, it would have been hard to think and we have the word orders of magnitude right in a way that is hard to write down much less

15:50.400 --> 15:54.360
Think about if you're doing Roman numerals like is there something analogous to that?

15:54.600 --> 15:56.600
descendants um, I

15:56.840 --> 15:59.080
mean fluency with a

15:59.760 --> 16:03.760
Programming interface really can help understanding certain problems

16:03.760 --> 16:09.200
I think the when people mess around in a notebook with something and when it feels like a really good tool set

16:09.240 --> 16:16.040
There's a way that that has the same sensation as adopting a nice notation in that you

16:16.640 --> 16:23.120
Write something with a small number of symbols, but then you discover a lot about the implication of that in the case of notation

16:23.120 --> 16:26.040
It's because the rules of algebra are very constrained

16:26.040 --> 16:32.440
And so when you write something you can go through an almost game-like process to see how it reduces and expands and then see something

16:32.440 --> 16:35.000
That might be non-trivial and in the case of programming

16:35.320 --> 16:40.520
Of course the machine is doing the crunching and you might get a plot that reveals some extra data

16:40.520 --> 16:47.840
I think we're maybe at a phase where there's room for that to become as a much more fluid process such that

16:48.720 --> 16:54.200
Rather than having these small little bits of friction like you've got to set up the environment and you got to like it in the notebook

16:54.200 --> 16:58.440
You've got to like find the right libraries that there's something that feels as fluid as when you are

17:00.080 --> 17:03.280
Good at algebra and you're just at a whiteboard kind of noodling it out

17:03.280 --> 17:08.280
I think there's something to be said for the fact that there's still so much more value in

17:09.280 --> 17:12.440
If you and I were to like go into some math topic right now, right?

17:12.440 --> 17:16.680
You ask me something that's a terrible question for a podcast, but I'm like, oh, let's actually dig into it

17:16.920 --> 17:19.080
The right medium to do that is still paper

17:19.080 --> 17:22.040
I think like I would break out some paper and we would scribble it out

17:22.040 --> 17:25.880
And so whenever it becomes the case that the right medium to do that

17:26.280 --> 17:29.160
Lends itself to simulation and to programming and all that

17:29.520 --> 17:34.760
That feels like it would get to the point where it shifts the way that you even think about stuff. Yeah, that's really interesting

17:35.400 --> 17:36.840
What's up with miracle years?

17:36.840 --> 17:42.200
So this is something that happens has happened throughout science and especially with mathematicians

17:42.480 --> 17:48.600
Where they have a single year in which they wake up many if not most of the important discoveries that they happen the career

17:48.920 --> 17:54.360
You know Newton, Einstein, Gauss, they all had these years. Do you have some explanation of what's going on?

17:55.240 --> 17:57.240
What's your take? I

17:57.280 --> 17:59.360
Think there's a bunch of possible explanations

17:59.360 --> 18:04.480
It can't just be youth because youth last ten years not one year

18:04.680 --> 18:07.880
So it must have something to do with every 35 year old right now

18:10.520 --> 18:16.160
You know, you know what I mean made 20 years. Yeah, so yeah, but it can't just be that

18:16.880 --> 18:21.320
I don't know. There's a bunch of possible things you could say one is you're in a situation in life

18:21.320 --> 18:25.520
Where you have nothing else going for you or you just like really free for that one year

18:25.520 --> 18:30.120
And then you become successful after that year is over based on what you did. Yeah, but what is your take?

18:30.120 --> 18:34.800
I don't know. I so I agree. That's probably multiple factors not one

18:35.520 --> 18:37.520
one thing could be that

18:38.120 --> 18:44.000
The miracle year is the like exhalation and there's been many many years of inhalation

18:44.280 --> 18:49.120
Where often let's say, you know, the classic one is Einstein's where his make miracle year

18:49.120 --> 18:53.920
we're also some of the first papers like kind of springing on to the scene and I

18:54.560 --> 18:56.560
Would guess that a lot of the ideas

18:56.960 --> 18:58.240
were not

18:58.240 --> 19:00.280
bumping around his head only in that year

19:00.280 --> 19:06.240
but it's like many many years of thinking about it and kind of coalescing and so you might be in a position where you can build up all

19:06.240 --> 19:07.280
of this

19:07.280 --> 19:09.280
potential energy and then

19:09.520 --> 19:13.600
For whatever reason there's one time in life that lends itself to actually releasing all of that

19:14.600 --> 19:16.600
If I try to reflect on like my own

19:17.040 --> 19:22.240
History with what I'm doing now. I think I didn't appreciate early on how much potential energy

19:22.240 --> 19:29.960
I was working from simply from being a student and in college where there's just a bunch of ways of thinking about things or empathy with new learners or

19:30.840 --> 19:32.520
Just cool concepts, right?

19:32.520 --> 19:38.640
The basic concept behind a video that in fact it was many many years of like all of my time having learned math

19:39.080 --> 19:44.840
Before I started putting out stuff online that I was able to eat into and then maybe it was a little later where

19:45.120 --> 19:46.680
Okay, the well never runs dry

19:46.680 --> 19:52.080
There's always a long list of things that I want to cover but in some sense like I recognize that the well was

19:52.840 --> 19:58.280
at risk of running dry in a way that I never thought that it could and without being a little deliberate about

19:59.720 --> 20:05.400
Devoting some of my day not just to output and producing but to stepping back and like learning new things and touching something

20:05.440 --> 20:07.520
I never would have that doesn't happen by default

20:07.520 --> 20:13.720
I don't know if this is all but also the case for the people who have genuine miracle years where they were like letting out all of

20:13.720 --> 20:17.960
This stuff and then it takes a decade to build up that same level of potential energy

20:18.760 --> 20:20.240
The other thing

20:20.240 --> 20:24.920
You have everything to gain and nothing to lose when you are young. So even if it's not merely youth

20:25.160 --> 20:28.160
There's a willingness to be creative and there's also

20:29.000 --> 20:33.520
None of the obligations that come from having found success before right

20:34.200 --> 20:38.960
You know, there's there's certain academics who made an extremely deliberate effort not to let

20:39.640 --> 20:44.160
What would they call it? Is it like the curse of success or there's some time for but I think maybe

20:45.040 --> 20:50.760
James Watson, you know had this standard reply to invitations for you know talks and interviews and things like that

20:50.760 --> 20:55.000
It was basically like no to everyone because I just want to be a scientist

20:55.040 --> 20:59.400
it was much more articulate than that and he has all these nine points, but that was the gist of it and

21:00.160 --> 21:01.320
Short of doing that

21:01.320 --> 21:06.080
I think it's very easy for someone to have a lot of other things that eat into their mind share and time and all of that that

21:06.200 --> 21:11.080
Even if it's just 20 hours a week like actually that that really interrupts a creative flow

21:11.720 --> 21:13.720
Were you a student when you started the channel?

21:14.520 --> 21:20.400
Technically, yeah, the very very first video was made when I was a senior at Stanford

21:21.280 --> 21:28.880
Basically, I'd been like toying around with just a personal programming project in my last year of college that was the beginnings of what is now like

21:28.880 --> 21:34.320
The animation tool I work with I didn't intend for it to be a thing that I would use as a math youtuber

21:34.320 --> 21:38.160
I didn't even really know what a youtuber was. It was really just like a personal project

21:38.600 --> 21:42.120
And it was March of that year

21:42.120 --> 21:47.120
I think that I published the first ever video and so it was kind of right at that transition point

21:47.120 --> 21:53.120
Do you think you could you would have done it if you had let's say become I don't know what you're planning on doing after college

21:53.120 --> 21:57.720
I remember you saying somewhere maybe a data scientist, but data scientist and math PhD were the two like

21:58.480 --> 22:03.200
50-50 contenders basically is there a role then which he started doing that but then later on

22:03.720 --> 22:10.160
Made manum or do you think that that was only possible in a world where you had some time to kill in your senior year?

22:10.160 --> 22:14.360
if the goal was to make math youtube videos, it would have been a

22:15.160 --> 22:19.680
wild thing to do to do it by like making manum as the method for it because

22:20.280 --> 22:24.480
It's so strikingly inefficient to do it that way at the very least

22:24.480 --> 22:27.840
I probably would have built on top of an existing framework if I had

22:27.840 --> 22:32.440
I mean there's so many things that I would tell my past self if I could go back in time even if the goal was to make that

22:32.440 --> 22:37.440
It's like certain design decisions that caused pain that could have been fixed earlier on

22:37.880 --> 22:42.160
But if the goal was to make videos, there's just so many good tools for making videos

22:42.160 --> 22:45.720
I probably would have started with those or if I wanted to script things

22:45.720 --> 22:50.960
Maybe I would have first learned after effects really effectively and then learn the scripting languages around after effects

22:50.960 --> 22:52.880
That might have even been better for all I know

22:52.880 --> 22:55.440
I really don't know but I just kind of walked into it because I

22:56.040 --> 23:01.880
The initial project was to make something that could illustrate certain ideas and math especially when it came to

23:02.560 --> 23:06.600
Visualizing functions as transformations mapping inputs to outputs as opposed to graphing

23:07.040 --> 23:10.840
the the video output was just a way of knowing that I had

23:11.680 --> 23:18.560
Completed that personal project in some sense and then it turned out to be fun because I also really enjoy teaching and really enjoy tutoring and stuff

23:19.120 --> 23:19.920
I

23:19.920 --> 23:24.680
Don't know then again. There's a lot of other people who make their own tools

23:25.600 --> 23:27.600
for math gifts and

23:27.800 --> 23:34.560
Little illustrations and things which on the one hand feels very inefficient like there's I don't know if people come across a math

23:34.560 --> 23:42.720
Gift on Wikipedia. There's a very high probability it comes from this one individual who just strangely prolific at producing these like creative commons visuals and

23:43.400 --> 23:47.080
He has his own like home baked thing for how he does it and then there's

23:47.640 --> 23:48.880
someone who

23:48.920 --> 23:53.760
Came across on Twitter Matt Matt Henderson who has these completely beautiful

23:54.320 --> 23:56.520
Math gifts and such and again

23:56.520 --> 23:59.360
It's a very home baked thing that is like built on top of

23:59.720 --> 24:01.800
Shaders, but he kind of has his own stuff there

24:01.800 --> 24:06.320
And maybe there's something to be said for the level of ownership that you feel once it is your own thing that just

24:06.480 --> 24:08.480
unlocks a sense of creativity and

24:08.480 --> 24:13.400
Feeling like hey, I can just describe whatever I want because if I can't already do it

24:13.400 --> 24:15.400
I'll just change the tool to make it able to do that

24:15.880 --> 24:21.960
For all I know that level of creative freedom is necessary to like take on a wide variety of topics, but

24:22.640 --> 24:27.360
Your guess is as good as mine for those counterfactuals. Yeah, this is personally interesting to me

24:27.760 --> 24:33.080
Because I also started the podcast in college and I just like was off track of anything

24:33.080 --> 24:38.120
I was planning on doing otherwise and if this is you know, many many orders of magnitude away from through the one round

24:38.120 --> 24:43.320
I don't want the audience to you know, cringe in unison, but I just think it's interesting like these kinds of projects

24:43.360 --> 24:44.720
How often

24:44.720 --> 24:49.840
Something that I don't know later on ends up being successful is something that was started almost on a whim as a hobby

24:50.120 --> 24:51.880
You know when you're in college or something like that

24:51.880 --> 24:57.440
I will say there's a benefit to starting it in a way that is low stakes like you're not banking on it growing

24:57.440 --> 24:59.440
I I had no

24:59.440 --> 25:02.600
Anticipation of much less an expectation of three blown round growing

25:02.600 --> 25:08.160
I think the reason I kind of kept doing it was in the fork of life if I did the math PhD and all that

25:08.160 --> 25:13.200
I thought it might be a good idea to have a little bit of a footprint on the internet for math exposition

25:13.320 --> 25:17.160
I was thinking of it as like a very niche thing that you know

25:17.160 --> 25:19.720
Maybe some math students and some people who are into math would like it

25:19.720 --> 25:24.880
But I could sort of show the stuff as a portfolio not as a as an audience

25:24.880 --> 25:28.600
You know size that was meaningful and I think I was surprised by what an appetite

25:28.600 --> 25:34.840
There was for the kind of things that I was making and in some ways maybe that's helpful because I see a lot of people who

25:35.640 --> 25:40.400
Jump in they they jump in with the goal of being a youtuber. I think it's the most common

25:41.360 --> 25:45.560
Desired job among the youth is to be like a tiktoker or a youtuber which think of that

25:45.560 --> 25:48.280
Well, but when you jump in with that as a goal

25:48.280 --> 25:54.160
You kind of aim for too large an audience and end up making the content which is best for no one

25:54.160 --> 25:56.440
Because one you're probably not that good at making videos yet

25:56.440 --> 26:00.400
And so you're competing if it's a general a generally applicable idea

26:00.680 --> 26:03.320
You're competing with like all of the other communicators out there

26:04.080 --> 26:06.280
Whereas if you do something that's almost

26:06.840 --> 26:12.880
Unreasonably niche and also you're not expecting it to blow up. It's like one you're not going to be disappointed

26:12.880 --> 26:17.320
It's like outstanding when a thousand people view it as opposed to being disappointing and then two

26:18.160 --> 26:23.560
You might be making something that is the best possible version of that content for the audience who watches it

26:23.560 --> 26:27.240
because no one else is making that for them because it's too narrow a target and

26:27.920 --> 26:31.120
That's sort of the beauty of the internet is that there is an incentive to do that

26:31.640 --> 26:35.440
And I don't know if this is the case with your podcast when you're starting off where

26:36.160 --> 26:42.760
Not thinking about oh, how can I make this as big as possible actually made it more in-depth for those who were listening to it

26:43.000 --> 26:47.920
Is it surprising to you that prehistoric humans don't seem to have had

26:48.960 --> 26:54.320
Just basic arithmetic and numeracy to me with with a sort of I guess to us with the modern

26:55.080 --> 26:59.120
Understanding that kind of stuff seems so universally useful and so fundamental

26:59.640 --> 27:03.960
That it's shocking that it just doesn't come about naturally in the course of interacting with the world

27:04.640 --> 27:09.280
Do you think it's is that surprising that it's just a concept of numbers and you're right

27:09.280 --> 27:13.800
It's so in our bones that it's hard to empathize with not having a numeracy a

27:14.640 --> 27:16.880
Lot of it's linked to if you think okay

27:16.880 --> 27:20.880
What's the first place that like people think about numbers most people like in their daily lives?

27:21.040 --> 27:28.480
It's linked to commerce and money and such so maybe some ways the question is the same as saying is it surprising that like early

27:28.800 --> 27:31.680
Humanity didn't have commerce or didn't deal with money

27:32.360 --> 27:35.920
Maybe when you're below Dunbar's number in your communities

27:36.360 --> 27:40.040
Like a tit for tat structure just makes a lot more sense and actually works well

27:40.040 --> 27:42.560
And it would just be obnoxious to like actually account for everything

27:43.240 --> 27:47.780
The other loosely related idea. Have you come across those?

27:48.480 --> 27:49.400
studies where

27:49.400 --> 27:56.840
When anthropologists will interview tribes of people that are removed enough from normal society that they don't have the level of numeracy that you're

27:56.840 --> 27:59.520
I do but they you know, there's some notion of counting you

27:59.640 --> 28:06.880
If you have one coconut or nine coconuts like you have a sense of that that if you ask what number is halfway between one and nine

28:07.840 --> 28:09.840
Those groups will answer three

28:10.480 --> 28:16.840
Whereas you or I or people in our world would probably answer five and because we think on this very linear scale

28:17.120 --> 28:21.320
It's interesting that evidently the like natural way to think about things is logarithmically

28:21.880 --> 28:29.480
Which it kind of makes sense like the social dynamics of as you go from solitude to a group of ten people to a group

28:29.480 --> 28:36.880
Of 100 people have roughly equal steps in increasing complexity more so than if you go from like one to fifty one to a hundred and two and

28:37.280 --> 28:41.960
I wonder if it's it's the case that by adding numeracy in some senses

28:41.960 --> 28:47.840
We've also like lost some numeracy or lost some intuition in others where now if you ask, you know

28:48.440 --> 28:52.720
Middle school teachers. What's a difficult topic to teacher for students to understand? They're like logarithms

28:53.800 --> 28:56.200
But that should be deep in our bones, right?

28:56.280 --> 29:00.840
So somehow it got unlearned in the needs to be maybe it's in the formal sense that it's harder to relearn it

29:00.840 --> 29:01.840
but there's

29:01.840 --> 29:05.320
there's maybe a sense of like numeracy and a sense of quantitative thinking that

29:06.160 --> 29:11.800
Humans naturally do have that is hard to appreciate when it's not expressed in the same language or in the same ways

29:12.280 --> 29:14.800
Yeah, I have seen the thing from Joseph Henrich where

29:15.360 --> 29:17.360
This still existing tribes were

29:18.080 --> 29:21.720
They're in this kind of situation. They can do

29:22.400 --> 29:26.480
Numeracy and arithmetic when it's in very concrete terms if you talk about seeds or something

29:26.520 --> 29:31.480
But that the abstract concept of a number is not is not available to them

29:32.320 --> 29:38.720
Do you think the abstract concept of a number is useful to your life? Oh, yeah, like in what ways?

29:39.480 --> 29:42.960
It's almost like asking how is the concept of the alphabet useful

29:42.960 --> 29:48.480
It comes up so often that it's I mean just like how many lights do I set up for this interview, right?

29:48.560 --> 29:54.160
It's not the concept of an abstract number though because it's like two people two lights one-to-one correspondence

29:54.160 --> 29:58.640
like did you leverage the abstraction of two as a

29:59.320 --> 30:03.440
Object, which is simultaneously a rational and a real and an integer. I see

30:03.880 --> 30:08.920
You know is in the context of a group that has additive structure, but also multiply

30:10.040 --> 30:16.160
There's light for you light for me, right? Yeah, I'm pretty sure the abstract idea of a number is important for all of us

30:16.160 --> 30:18.160
but I don't think it's

30:19.120 --> 30:25.140
Immediately obvious. It's more that it shapes the way we think. I'm not sure if it actually changes like the way we live

30:26.160 --> 30:30.760
If you assume you don't work in STEM, right? We're like you literally are using it all the time

30:31.440 --> 30:35.240
Yeah, I'm trying to go through my day and think through what where am I using them?

30:35.240 --> 30:40.040
I mean, there's the obvious stuff like the commerce examples you mentioned where you go to a restaurant

30:40.040 --> 30:43.840
You're figuring out what to pay or what to tip, but that seems a very particular example

30:43.840 --> 30:48.180
Do I really use numbers that infrequently? I don't know. Yeah

30:49.480 --> 30:55.040
Many people listening are probably screaming out of their head like much more apt examples, but

30:56.720 --> 30:58.400
It's hard to say yeah, yeah

30:58.400 --> 31:05.760
Well when a mathematician is working on a problem, what is the biggest mental constraint? Is it working memory? Is it processing speed?

31:06.400 --> 31:11.040
Plants are limited by nitrogen usually like what is the equivalent of nitrogen for a mathematician?

31:11.640 --> 31:15.120
That's a fun question. I mean, so I'm not a research mathematician

31:15.240 --> 31:20.840
I shouldn't pretend like I am and so the right people to ask that question would be the research mathematicians. I

31:21.640 --> 31:26.200
Wonder if you're gonna get consistent answers as with so many things. There's not one

31:28.560 --> 31:30.240
Maybe

31:30.240 --> 31:32.240
the number of available

31:33.200 --> 31:36.680
Analogies to be able to draw connections like the more

31:37.520 --> 31:42.320
Exposure you've had to disparate fields such that you could maybe see oh a problem-solving approach that was used here

31:42.320 --> 31:46.080
might be useful here sometimes that's literally codified in the forms of

31:46.920 --> 31:52.240
Connections between different fields as you know functors between categories or something like that, but sometimes it's a lot more

31:53.280 --> 31:58.000
Intuitive the idea that a general flavor of an you know, someone's doing a

31:59.240 --> 32:04.840
Combinatorics type question and they're like oh maybe generating functions are this useful like tool to bring to bear and then in some completely

32:04.840 --> 32:09.960
Different context of studying like prime numbers. They're like, oh, maybe it could take a generating function type approach

32:10.560 --> 32:12.560
Maybe you have to massage it to make it work

32:12.560 --> 32:18.840
And the one of the reasons I say this is one of the tendencies that you've seen in math papers

32:19.320 --> 32:21.320
In let's say to like the last 200 years

32:21.400 --> 32:25.880
The typical number of authors is like much bigger now than before you people have this

32:25.880 --> 32:31.760
I think misconception that math is a field with lone geniuses who are off like coming up with great insights like alone next to a

32:31.760 --> 32:36.280
Blackboard and the reality is it's a highly collaborative field. I remember one of the first

32:36.880 --> 32:40.360
Times that I was hearing from a mathematician's like a young kid

32:40.360 --> 32:45.280
And I was in this math circles event and someone was asking this person like what surprised you about your job

32:45.400 --> 32:49.560
But the first thing he said was how much travel was involved that he wasn't expecting that

32:50.040 --> 32:56.000
And it's because you know if you're studying some very specific niche field that the way that you make progress in that is by

32:56.040 --> 33:01.200
Collaborating with other people like in that field or maybe adjacent to that field and there's only so many about them

33:01.200 --> 33:06.040
They probably aren't at your university. So you travel a lot to work with them these days a lot of that

33:06.040 --> 33:10.260
I think happens on on zoom, but conferences are still super important and these sorts of

33:10.840 --> 33:17.000
Events that bring people all under one roof like MSRI is maybe an example of a place that's trying to does that systematically

33:17.800 --> 33:19.480
and

33:19.480 --> 33:22.600
You could say that's a social thing, you know get get more ideas

33:22.600 --> 33:27.200
But I think it's maybe hitting on this idea that what you want is exposure to as many available analogies

33:27.720 --> 33:32.600
So the short answer to your question is like the nitrogen for mathematician is the analogy

33:32.840 --> 33:36.800
This actually is an interesting question. I wasn't planning on asking you, but it just occurred to me

33:36.800 --> 33:43.200
Is it surprising how new a lot of mathematics is even mathematics that has taught at the high school level

33:43.400 --> 33:46.560
Whereas with physics or biology, that's also new

33:46.560 --> 33:50.720
But you can tell a story where we didn't have the tools to look at the cell or to

33:51.160 --> 33:57.600
Inspect an electron until very recently, but we've had mathematicians for two three thousand years who were doing

33:58.240 --> 34:03.680
You know pretty sophisticated things even the ancient Greeks not depends on what you mean by sophisticated, but impressive things

34:03.680 --> 34:06.600
I don't know why linear algebra is so new given that fact

34:06.600 --> 34:12.080
I wouldn't have thought of math as being like new in that way if anything especially for talking at the high school level

34:12.080 --> 34:18.600
I remember there's always a sensation that it's frustrating that all of the things are actually a way more than a hundred years old

34:19.160 --> 34:24.400
In terms of you know that the names attached to the theorems that you're doing like none of them are remotely modern

34:24.520 --> 34:26.640
whereas in biology, you know the

34:27.960 --> 34:34.760
Understanding we have for like how proteins are formed is relatively much more modern and you might be just a couple generations away

34:34.760 --> 34:38.840
I at some extent there's a raw manpower component to it

34:38.840 --> 34:43.160
We're like how many people did pure math for most of history for most of history?

34:43.360 --> 34:45.680
No one no one was a pure mathematician

34:45.680 --> 34:49.600
They were like a mathematician plus something else or they were a physicist who you know

34:49.600 --> 34:54.140
They were a natural philosopher and in so far as you're doing like natural philosophy one component of that is

34:54.500 --> 35:00.820
Developing math, but it's not the full extent of what you do, you know, even the ones who we think of is like very very

35:01.940 --> 35:07.940
Pure mathematicians in the sense that a lot of their most famous results are pure math like gauss actually a lot of the work

35:08.460 --> 35:12.900
a lot of his you know output was also centered on very practical problems and

35:14.180 --> 35:20.200
Yeah, and maybe like since then that's when you start to get an era of something more like pure mathematicians and

35:21.080 --> 35:27.000
The raw number available that you have that man hours that are being put into developing new theorems is

35:27.760 --> 35:34.200
Probably just got this huge spike as one the population grows and then also the percentage of the population that has the economic freedom to do

35:34.200 --> 35:36.660
Something as indulgent as academia like grows

35:37.440 --> 35:41.760
Maybe it's pretty reasonable that most of it is much much more recent

35:42.920 --> 35:44.080
That would be my guess

35:44.080 --> 35:48.960
But I mean some of these things seem actually pretty modern like information theory is less than a hundred years old

35:48.960 --> 35:54.720
That's true, and it's you know pretty fundamental like theoretically you could have written that paper a long time ago

35:54.720 --> 35:55.840
That's a really good example

35:55.840 --> 36:00.680
And maybe like this is a sign that the math that's developed is more in the service of

36:00.840 --> 36:04.080
The world that you live in and the adjacent problems that it's used to solve

36:04.160 --> 36:09.720
Then we typically think of it on the one hand information theory such a good example because it's so pure that

36:10.120 --> 36:13.040
You could have asked the question you could have defined the notion of a bit

36:13.080 --> 36:16.600
But evidently there wasn't a strong enough need to think in that way

36:16.920 --> 36:22.480
Whereas when you're doing error correction or you're thinking about actual information channels over

36:22.480 --> 36:28.920
You know a wire and you're at Bell Labs that that's that's what prompts it another maybe really good example for that would be chaos theory

36:28.920 --> 36:31.680
You could easily ask why why is chaos theory so recent?

36:32.000 --> 36:37.440
You could have you know written the Lorenz equations since differential equations existed

36:37.840 --> 36:42.200
Why didn't anyone do that and understand that there was this sort of sensitivity to initial conditions?

36:42.240 --> 36:49.120
And in that case it would maybe be the opposite where it's not that you need the existence of computers as a problem

36:49.240 --> 36:52.440
To solve or the problems that they introduce of the problems to solve

36:52.560 --> 36:57.880
But instead you need them to even discover the phenomenon in the first place like a lot of original

36:58.440 --> 37:03.000
Concepts in chaos theory came from basically running simulations or doing things that required a

37:04.080 --> 37:08.520
Massive amount of computation that simply wouldn't be done by hand someone could ask the question

37:08.520 --> 37:11.560
but they wouldn't have observed the unexpected phenomenon and

37:12.240 --> 37:14.040
There even if it's

37:14.040 --> 37:20.840
Questions that are as relevant to a pre-computer world as to a post-computer world like the nature of weather modeling or just the nature

37:21.160 --> 37:23.280
Three-body problem like all of that kind of stuff

37:24.520 --> 37:30.400
Somehow without the right tools for thought it just didn't come into the mind and so maybe yeah, maybe there's

37:31.280 --> 37:33.280
other things like that where

37:34.120 --> 37:36.120
those

37:36.360 --> 37:40.000
Questions were pieces of technology that start to fundamentally shape everyone's life

37:40.320 --> 37:44.080
Will then invariably also shift like the mathematicians focus

37:44.520 --> 37:50.200
Mmm. This actually reminds me the first day of Scott Ironson's quantum information class

37:50.360 --> 37:55.160
He said that what I'm about to describe to you could have been discovered by a mathematician

37:55.680 --> 37:59.280
Before you know quantum physics existed if only they'd ask the question

37:59.840 --> 38:01.160
We're gonna do probabilities

38:01.160 --> 38:05.760
But we're only allowed to use unitaries and the rest of it is a you know

38:05.760 --> 38:08.440
You could have just discovered of quantum mechanics or quantum information from there

38:08.440 --> 38:13.280
I mean the thing about math right, especially if you're talking about pure axiomatized math

38:13.800 --> 38:19.280
the experience as a student as an undergrad is that you are going through a textbook and it starts with saying

38:19.280 --> 38:25.720
Here's the axioms of this field and then we're gonna deduce from those axioms like various different lemmas and theorems and proceed from that and

38:26.680 --> 38:31.520
With that as the framing you get the impression that you could have just come up with any axioms

38:32.240 --> 38:37.280
Make up some pile of axioms deduce what follows from them and the space of possible like math is

38:37.960 --> 38:41.240
Unfathomably huge and so you need some process that calls down

38:41.280 --> 38:47.920
What are the useful things to maybe pursue and so one of the things that I think is all too often missing in those pure math

38:48.000 --> 38:54.800
Textbooks is the basically the motivating problem. Why is it that this was the set of axioms people found to be useful and not something else?

38:54.920 --> 39:01.000
You know the framework for quantum information theory. It's like you married together linear linear algebra and probability

39:01.160 --> 39:01.920
That's great

39:01.920 --> 39:07.280
but there's all sorts of other things where you could kind of try to cram them together and maybe get some sort of math out and

39:08.240 --> 39:11.400
The the question becomes is it worth your time to do that?

39:11.600 --> 39:18.440
You know not theory is something that emerged because I think it was Lord Kelvin had a theory that all of the

39:19.000 --> 39:20.360
like

39:20.360 --> 39:23.560
elements on the periodic table had structures which were

39:24.360 --> 39:29.040
Related to a knot like a knot being if you have a closed loop in 3d space

39:29.200 --> 39:33.120
But maybe if you want to continuously deform it without it ever crossing itself

39:33.280 --> 39:38.320
You ask the question like could you get back to say an open loop or if you can't get back to an open loop

39:38.320 --> 39:42.280
What are the set of all other loops in 3d space that could be deformed into that?

39:42.280 --> 39:46.960
And you end up categorizing what all the different knots are and this was started with a

39:47.560 --> 39:51.880
completely incorrect theory for what's going on at the atomic level that gives

39:52.480 --> 39:58.080
Adams this very stable structure because I think you you found with smoke rings like if you're

39:58.520 --> 40:01.160
Somehow very dexterous with how you create these smoke rings

40:01.160 --> 40:06.960
You can get them to form knots in 3d and they're they're very stable. It's like weirdly stable in the it'll never

40:07.400 --> 40:11.680
You know cross over itself, and so it has all those properties now

40:11.920 --> 40:15.200
That was irrelevant for understanding the periodic table

40:15.200 --> 40:18.080
But it was an interesting mathematical question and people kind of ran with it

40:18.160 --> 40:23.440
And in that case it was an arbitrary reason that someone thought to ask the question and then some people ran with it

40:23.440 --> 40:28.520
And frankly, it's probably fewer people who run with it than would if it turned out to be a more useful question

40:29.160 --> 40:33.600
So really you want to ask like what are the what are the things that prompt people to ask?

40:33.600 --> 40:39.880
What turns out to be a mathematical question given that the space of what would be mathematical questions is so unfathomably huge that it's

40:40.040 --> 40:43.040
It's just impossible to explore it through a random walk wait

40:43.040 --> 40:47.640
Are you saying that lord kelvin's apple hitting you in story was that he was smoking a lot of pipe

40:49.720 --> 40:56.600
Categorizes the puffs yeah, I can't remember if it was smoke rings out of his mouth, but I mean that's a natural place

40:56.600 --> 40:58.600
We should look into that

40:59.480 --> 41:07.040
Okay, so you you've changed how you and other creators have changed how pedagogy happens via animated videos

41:08.000 --> 41:15.480
What would it take to do something similar for video games text all these other mediums? Why hasn't there been a similar sort of

41:16.280 --> 41:19.760
broad-scale adoption and transformation of how teaching happens there

41:20.440 --> 41:22.440
I'm not sure I understand the question you're saying

41:23.720 --> 41:31.600
Where there's been a rise of explanatory videos. Yeah, why is there not a similar rise in like pedagogical video games? Yeah, and

41:32.480 --> 41:33.960
well

41:33.960 --> 41:37.000
One thing to understand I guess games are very hard to make

41:38.040 --> 41:40.680
it takes a lot of resources for a given game and

41:42.000 --> 41:48.840
Whenever people seem to try to do it with pedagogy as a motive like they're making some game whose goal is to teach something I

41:49.880 --> 41:50.960
Don't play enough games

41:50.960 --> 41:56.280
So I can't really speak to it the way that well-versed game designers can it seems to be the case that they are not

41:57.000 --> 42:03.240
Fun in the way that people would want them to be fun and then the ones that are actually most effective are not

42:04.080 --> 42:06.080
You know as directly educational

42:06.840 --> 42:10.720
So there's clearly some of the one the one game that I actually have played

42:11.040 --> 42:15.880
Because enough of my friends told me hey, you should really do this. It seems relevant to not explanation

42:16.120 --> 42:19.680
In the last like decade was the witness. Yeah, have you played it? I've heard about it

42:20.000 --> 42:25.400
So as someone who doesn't play games and then did play it. It's fantastic

42:25.400 --> 42:29.480
It's absolutely well done in every possible way that you could want something to be well done

42:30.040 --> 42:32.040
and critical on that is the

42:32.480 --> 42:37.560
nature of how problems are solved the reason people were recommending it to me is because the feeling of playing the witness is a

42:37.560 --> 42:39.560
Lot like the feeling of doing math

42:39.560 --> 42:41.120
It's non-verbal

42:41.120 --> 42:47.280
You come across these little puzzles where the simple mechanics of one puzzle inform you about the fundamental

42:47.560 --> 42:51.760
Mechanics that become relevant to much much harder ones such that if you do it with the right sequence

42:51.880 --> 42:55.880
you have the feeling of epiphany in ways that are like very self-satisfying and

42:56.640 --> 42:58.640
You can you come away feeling like man

42:58.920 --> 43:03.920
You should be able to do something like this for math and maybe you can and it's just that

43:04.160 --> 43:06.680
It's so hard to make a game at all

43:06.680 --> 43:12.320
That there's just not the rate of production that you would need to explore like get enough games out there that one of them

43:12.320 --> 43:18.040
Hits because with YouTube, there's a lot of math videos on YouTube. It's okay that most of them suck

43:18.040 --> 43:19.800
Right, it's okay because hey

43:19.800 --> 43:24.560
You just need enough that when someone searches for the term that they want they get one that is good and scratches that itch

43:24.880 --> 43:28.600
or that you know, they might get recommended something that is

43:29.720 --> 43:33.840
Bringing a question to their mind that they wouldn't have thought about but they become really interested once it's there

43:34.120 --> 43:40.400
Whereas with video games, I don't know. You're also spending a lot more time as a user on each one rather than a five-minute average

43:40.720 --> 43:44.800
Experience, it's like a many many hour average experience. You ask the question on text

43:44.800 --> 43:47.560
I don't know if I accept the premise that there's not the same

43:48.120 --> 43:50.120
advances and

43:51.080 --> 43:57.240
Innovation in the world of textual explanations like math a gun is a really really good example of this that's

43:57.720 --> 43:59.720
Like the textbook of the future

44:00.120 --> 44:03.240
It's a website. It's basically an interactive textbook

44:03.480 --> 44:08.560
The explanations are really good and in so far as it doesn't have more of an impact or more of a reach

44:08.560 --> 44:12.600
It's maybe just because people don't know about it or don't have an easy means of accessing

44:13.280 --> 44:15.280
Something that recommends to them like the really good

44:16.280 --> 44:18.280
innovations happening in the world of

44:18.640 --> 44:25.160
Textual explanations in the way that YouTube has this recommending engine that tries its hardest to get more of these things in front of people

44:25.680 --> 44:29.240
And I'm quite sure that in the world of actual like written textbooks

44:29.320 --> 44:35.280
You I mean, there's so many that I like so much that I think it would be a disservice to talk about that

44:36.000 --> 44:38.680
medium is not like making advances in terms of

44:39.200 --> 44:45.680
More and more thought put towards empathy to the learner and things like that. Should the top point one percent of educators

44:45.840 --> 44:52.720
Should they be exclusively on the internet because it seems like a waste if you were just a college professor or a high school professor

44:52.720 --> 44:55.320
And you were teaching 50 kids a year or something

44:56.000 --> 45:00.840
Given the greater scale available should should more of them be trying to see if they can reach more people

45:00.840 --> 45:06.200
I think it's not a bad thing for more educators who are good at what they're doing to put their stuff online for sure

45:06.200 --> 45:10.400
I highly encourage that even if it's as simple as getting someone to put a camera in the back of the classroom

45:10.400 --> 45:14.680
I don't think it would be a good idea to get those people out of the classroom if anything

45:14.680 --> 45:20.360
I think one of the best things that I could do for my career would be to put myself into more classrooms

45:20.600 --> 45:26.320
And actually I'm quite determined at some point to like be a high school math teacher for some number of years

45:26.320 --> 45:29.960
I don't know when there's such opportunity cost. I guess

45:30.960 --> 45:36.080
Probably it's something I would plan on like notably later as long as there's not other like

45:36.400 --> 45:43.760
Life logistics that occupy a lot of mind share because everything I know about high school teaching is like it just kicks your ass for the first

45:43.760 --> 45:46.960
Right two years, but I would say I

45:47.840 --> 45:53.280
One of the most valuable things that you can have if you're trying to explain stuff online is a sense of empathy for what the possible

45:53.480 --> 45:55.480
Viewers are like that that are out there

45:55.640 --> 46:00.920
The more distance that you put between yourself and them in terms of life circumstances

46:00.920 --> 46:02.480
You know, I'm not a college student

46:02.480 --> 46:06.960
So I don't have the same empathy with what a college students like certainly not a high school student

46:06.960 --> 46:13.520
So I've lost that empathy that distance just makes it more and more of an uphill battle to make the content good for them and

46:14.120 --> 46:15.520
I think

46:15.520 --> 46:21.120
Keeping people in regular touch with just what people in the classroom actively need is

46:21.800 --> 46:24.320
Necessary for them to remain as good and as sharp as they are

46:24.360 --> 46:28.440
So yes get more of those top 0.1 percent to put their stuff online

46:28.440 --> 46:33.560
But like I would absolutely disagree with the idea of taking them out of their existing circumstances

46:34.040 --> 46:38.000
Maybe for a year or two so they don't lose that sharpness, but then like put them right back in

46:38.680 --> 46:40.520
because

46:40.520 --> 46:43.320
One it makes them better at the online explicit position, but also

46:45.160 --> 46:48.600
The other thing I might disagree with is the idea that the reach is lower

46:49.400 --> 46:50.520
Because

46:50.520 --> 46:52.880
Okay, yes, it's a smaller number of people

46:53.200 --> 46:57.720
But you're with them for much much more time and you actually have the chance of influencing their trajectory

46:58.200 --> 47:03.440
through a social connection in a way that you you just don't over YouTube and

47:03.840 --> 47:09.440
I think you're using the word education in a way that I would maybe sub out for the word explanation

47:09.440 --> 47:11.720
like you want explanations to be online but like

47:12.400 --> 47:18.200
Education the word education derives from the same route as the word educe like to bring out

47:18.760 --> 47:22.200
And I really like that as a bit of etymology because it reminds you that

47:22.760 --> 47:26.920
The job of an educator is not to like take their knowledge and shove it into the heads of someone else

47:27.000 --> 47:28.840
The job is to bring it out

47:28.840 --> 47:31.880
That's very very hard to do in a video and in fact

47:32.520 --> 47:37.160
Even if you can kind of get at it by asking intriguing questions for the most part the video is there to

47:38.120 --> 47:40.120
Answer something once someone has a question and

47:40.760 --> 47:46.280
The teacher's job or the educator's job should be to provide the environment such that you're bringing out from your students as much as you can

47:46.600 --> 47:47.600
through

47:47.600 --> 47:52.440
Inspirated through projects through little bits of mentorship and encouragement along the way that

47:53.160 --> 47:59.720
Requires, you know eye contact and being there in person and being at the true figure in their life rather than just an abstract voice behind a screen

48:00.440 --> 48:03.240
Then should we think of educators more as motivational speakers?

48:03.880 --> 48:06.440
As in the actual job of getting the content in your head

48:07.000 --> 48:09.880
Is is maybe for the textbooks or for the youtube

48:10.120 --> 48:13.800
But now the job like why we have college classes or high school classes

48:14.200 --> 48:18.600
Is we have somebody who approximates tony robbins to you know get you to do the thing?

48:19.000 --> 48:23.960
That would be a subset of it, but there's there's more than just motivational speech that goes into it, right?

48:24.200 --> 48:25.320
there's

48:25.320 --> 48:30.280
Facilitation of projects or even coming up with what the project projects are or recognizing

48:30.520 --> 48:35.320
What a student is interested in so that you can try to tailor a question to their specific set of interests

48:35.640 --> 48:42.040
Or you can maybe act as the curator where hey, there's a lot of online explanations for what a Poisson distribution is

48:42.280 --> 48:46.920
You know okay, which of these is the right one that I could serve and based on knowing you as a particular student

48:47.000 --> 48:49.800
What might resonate you might be in a better position to do that?

48:50.440 --> 48:52.200
all of that

48:52.200 --> 48:53.640
goes beyond

48:53.640 --> 48:59.320
Being a tony robbins out, you know saying like oh you be the best person that you can be and all of that

49:00.120 --> 49:01.320
and

49:01.320 --> 49:04.440
One one thing I might say is that anytime that I'll chat with

49:04.840 --> 49:09.560
Mathematicians and try to get a sense for how they got into it what got them started so so often

49:10.120 --> 49:12.120
It starts by saying well, there was this one teacher

49:12.680 --> 49:14.600
And that teacher did something very small

49:14.680 --> 49:17.160
They like pulled them aside and just said hey, you're really good at this

49:17.240 --> 49:21.240
Have you considered studying more or they give them an interesting problem and the thing that takes

49:22.040 --> 49:26.760
Like at most 30 minutes of the teacher's time, maybe even 30 seconds has these

49:27.320 --> 49:33.320
Completely monumental rippling effects for the life of the student they were talking to that then sets this them on this whole different trajectory

49:33.800 --> 49:36.600
um two examples of this come to mind actually one is

49:37.480 --> 49:39.880
This woman who was saying she had this moment

49:39.880 --> 49:41.800
She got pulled aside from the teacher

49:41.800 --> 49:44.200
And he just said like hey, I think you're really good at math

49:44.280 --> 49:48.040
He should consider being a math major which had been completely outside of her

49:48.440 --> 49:52.360
Like purview at that time and that like changed the way she thought about it

49:52.760 --> 49:56.120
And then later she said she learned that he like did that for a large number of people

49:58.040 --> 49:59.560
Hey, you're really good at that

49:59.560 --> 50:05.000
Um, so that's a level of impact that you can have in person as a as a figure in their lives in a way that you can't over a screen

50:05.960 --> 50:11.800
Then another one which was very funny. I was asking this guy why he went into the specific field that he did

50:12.360 --> 50:14.920
It was a seemingly arbitrary thing in my mind

50:15.560 --> 50:19.320
But I guess all all pure math seems to be and he said that he

50:20.040 --> 50:22.760
for his first year of grad school was um

50:23.240 --> 50:27.880
Sitting in this seminar and at the end of the seminar the professor who was this you know old professor

50:27.880 --> 50:31.480
He had never met him before they didn't have any kind of connection. He six this guy out

50:31.560 --> 50:33.240
He comes up and he says you

50:33.240 --> 50:36.680
I have a problem for you a good research problem that I think I think might be um

50:37.160 --> 50:40.280
A good place for you to start in the next couple months and this guy was like

50:40.760 --> 50:45.640
Oh, okay, and he like gets this research problem and he spends some months thinking about it and he comes back

50:46.360 --> 50:49.000
And then it later came to light that the professor

50:49.640 --> 50:51.640
Mistook him for someone else

50:52.680 --> 50:56.040
Someone he was supposed to be mentoring and so he was just like

50:56.200 --> 51:00.520
Like the the stereotypical image of like a doddering old math professor

51:00.520 --> 51:05.240
Who's not very in tune with the people in his life that was the actual situation actual situation

51:05.480 --> 51:11.560
But nevertheless that moment of accidentally giving someone a problem completely shifted the research path for him

51:12.120 --> 51:18.280
Which if nothing else shows you the sensitivity to initial conditions that takes place when you are a student

51:19.160 --> 51:20.280
and how

51:20.280 --> 51:22.280
the educator

51:22.360 --> 51:27.160
Is is right on that nexus of sensitivity who can completely swing the fences one way or another for

51:27.640 --> 51:30.760
um what you do and for every one of those stories there's going to be

51:31.560 --> 51:38.440
An unfortunate counter balancing story about people who are demotivated from math. I mean I um, I think this was seventh grade

51:38.920 --> 51:40.520
there was

51:40.520 --> 51:42.520
this math class that I was in

51:43.080 --> 51:48.040
And I was one of the people who was like good at math and enjoyed it and would often like help the people in the class

51:48.120 --> 51:50.120
Understand it and all that and so I I had enough

51:51.000 --> 51:54.840
ego built up I guess to have like a strong shell around things and

51:55.640 --> 51:59.880
I guess for context there were I also really liked music and there was this like a concert that had happened

52:00.040 --> 52:03.400
Where I had like a certain solo or something earlier in the day or earlier in that week

52:03.880 --> 52:06.280
And there was a substitute teacher on one day

52:06.440 --> 52:09.800
So she didn't have like any of the context and she gave some lesson

52:10.120 --> 52:14.680
And then had that's been the second half of the class going over the um the homework for it

52:15.320 --> 52:18.760
all of the other students in the class were very confused and

52:19.240 --> 52:22.440
I think I remember like they would kind of come to me and I would try to offer to help them

52:23.080 --> 52:28.920
And the substitute was going around the class in these circles and basically marking off a little star for how far down the homework

52:29.080 --> 52:33.640
People were just to get a sense. Are they progressing and that was kind of her way of measuring. Are they very far?

52:34.280 --> 52:39.160
And when she got to me I had done like none of them because I was spending my whole time trying to help all of the others

52:39.560 --> 52:45.000
And she like after having written a little star next to the same problem like three different times

52:45.400 --> 52:47.160
She said to me like, you know

52:47.160 --> 52:49.160
Sometimes music people just aren't math people

52:49.720 --> 52:51.320
And it keeps walking on

52:51.320 --> 52:56.840
So now I was in the best possible circumstance to not let that hit hard because like one

52:57.160 --> 53:00.360
I had the moral high ground of like, hey, I've just been helping all these people

53:00.360 --> 53:05.560
Like I understand it and I've been doing your job for you. This was my like little egotistical seventh grade brain

53:06.040 --> 53:07.880
I I knew that I knew the stuff and things like that

53:08.280 --> 53:11.960
Even still even with all of that as like the armor that was put up

53:12.200 --> 53:15.000
I remember it was just this like shock to my system

53:15.000 --> 53:17.720
You know, she says this thing and it just made me like

53:18.440 --> 53:20.520
Strangely teary-eyed or something

53:20.520 --> 53:24.120
And I can only imagine if you're in a position where you're not confident in math

53:24.120 --> 53:27.400
And the thing that you know deep in your heart is actually you are kind of struggling with it

53:27.720 --> 53:34.520
Just a little throwaway comment like that could completely derail the whole system in terms of your relationship with the subject. So it's another

53:35.800 --> 53:41.720
Example to illustrate the sensitivity to initial conditions, right where there, you know, I was I wasn't a robust position

53:41.720 --> 53:47.160
It wasn't as sensitive I was I was gonna love math no matter what but you envision someone who's a little bit more on that teetering edge

53:47.240 --> 53:50.360
And the comment one way or another either saying you're good at this

53:50.360 --> 53:55.000
You should consider majoring in it or saying sometimes music people aren't math people which isn't even

53:55.720 --> 53:56.760
True

53:56.760 --> 53:59.000
Or you know what I mean like that was the other thing about it that

54:00.200 --> 54:02.520
That like niggled at my brain when she said it

54:03.080 --> 54:08.280
Yeah, I all all of that is just so important for people's development that

54:09.160 --> 54:14.040
When people talk about online education as being you know valuable or revolutionary or anything like that

54:14.600 --> 54:18.840
There's a part of me that sort of rolls my eyes because it it just doesn't get at the truth that

54:19.400 --> 54:22.520
Online explanations have nothing to do with all of that important stuff

54:22.520 --> 54:27.560
That's actually happening and at best it should be like in the service of helping that that side of things

54:27.560 --> 54:29.560
That's where the rubber meets the road

54:29.720 --> 54:35.560
I had Tyler Cohen on the podcast and he obviously has marginal revolution university these youtube videos where the explains economics

54:35.960 --> 54:37.960
And he had a similar answer to give

54:38.360 --> 54:43.960
I think I asked basically why aren't you just replacing or should we think of you as a substitute for all these economics teachers?

54:44.440 --> 54:46.440
And in his mind as well

54:47.320 --> 54:50.600
He was more a compliment to to the functions that happen in

54:51.160 --> 54:53.800
In the class um and to your point about the initial conditions

54:53.800 --> 54:57.160
I'm sure you remember the details of the story, but I just vaguely remember hearing this

54:57.560 --> 55:02.760
Wasn't their case where a mathematician who went later ended up becoming famous. He arrives to a lecture late

55:03.240 --> 55:07.000
See do you want to tell the story? I don't remember it uh beat for beat

55:07.080 --> 55:11.640
But I think it was a statistics class and he was a grad student and he comes in

55:11.880 --> 55:15.080
It's late and there's two problems on the board that the professor had written

55:15.480 --> 55:18.120
He assumed that those two problems were homework

55:18.440 --> 55:21.400
And so he goes home and he like works on them and after a couple weeks

55:21.640 --> 55:26.200
He goes to the professor's office and like turns in his homework and he's like, I'm sorry. I'm so late

55:26.200 --> 55:30.280
This one it just took me a lot longer than some of the others and the professor's like, oh, okay

55:30.840 --> 55:32.520
And just like shuffles it away

55:32.520 --> 55:36.040
And then a couple days later when the prophet had the time to like go through and see them

55:36.360 --> 55:39.400
He realized that the student had fully answered these questions

55:39.560 --> 55:43.800
What the student didn't know is that they were not homework problems written on the chalkboard

55:44.040 --> 55:49.640
They were two unsolved problems in the field that the prophet put up as examples of what the field was striving for

55:50.200 --> 55:54.360
I don't remember what problems they were so that that would be more fun color to add to the story

55:54.680 --> 55:59.480
But then at least as the anecdote told to me however many years ago goes

55:59.800 --> 56:04.840
The prophet then like finds the student's housing and like knocks on the door. He's like, do you realize that like

56:05.720 --> 56:07.720
these were actually unsolved problems and

56:08.200 --> 56:10.200
Then he gets to basically make those his thesis

56:10.840 --> 56:11.720
so

56:11.720 --> 56:13.720
that yeah that idea of

56:14.200 --> 56:18.760
Just being given something for completely random reasons and it and it shifts the course of what you do

56:19.320 --> 56:21.320
Right, right, right or just

56:21.320 --> 56:23.560
You know, it's a thing where if you know a cross sort of solvable

56:23.960 --> 56:28.280
You just like you just keep going at it until you solve it whereas or the four-minute mile, right exactly

56:28.440 --> 56:32.920
Yeah, exactly. That's a great example. I another valuable experience at least one I had was

56:33.960 --> 56:40.840
Taking erranton's classes in college and realizing I am like at least two standard deviations below him

56:41.160 --> 56:45.720
And that was actually a really valuable experience for me. Um, not because it increased my confidence in

56:46.600 --> 56:48.600
I didn't I didn't have a moment where

56:49.160 --> 56:52.120
I was like, oh, wow, I'm good at this but it was useful to know

56:52.840 --> 56:54.840
You know, but podcasting is

56:55.160 --> 57:00.520
An easier thing to do, right? So then it's good to know that there are actual technical things out there where

57:01.240 --> 57:06.120
Knowing that you can get really deep into something and people are just going to be like way above you having that sort of awareness

57:07.000 --> 57:11.640
Do you think it's fair to have a mental model that has a static

57:12.520 --> 57:18.760
G factor type quality here such that your two standard deviations below and that is forever the state of things

57:19.400 --> 57:22.840
Or do you think that the right mental model is something that allows for flexibility on

57:23.800 --> 57:27.800
Where contributions actually come from or where intuitions come from that, you know

57:27.800 --> 57:30.200
Through many years of experience and certain kinds of problem solving

57:30.200 --> 57:36.680
Maybe what seemed like a flash of insight was actually like the residue of just years of thinking about certain kinds of puzzles that

57:37.080 --> 57:40.680
He had that you maybe didn't you can answer like a story from that class actually

57:41.240 --> 57:42.280
so

57:42.280 --> 57:47.720
He's giving some proof about like how one complete it actually wasn't that he was giving a proof of that

57:48.120 --> 57:50.920
I forgot the name of the method, but it's a very important method in complexity theory

57:51.320 --> 57:53.880
that helped to prove the the bounds of

57:55.720 --> 57:57.720
The complexity of different problems

57:57.880 --> 58:00.440
And he explains it and he says, you know

58:01.240 --> 58:03.240
In 1999

58:03.240 --> 58:08.680
I I approved this myself, but I realized that six months before somebody had already published a paper

58:09.080 --> 58:13.000
With this method and I realized I'm catching up to the frontier now, you know, but

58:13.880 --> 58:18.280
When I was a kid I was like doing euler. That's like 2000 years in regress now and six months behind

58:18.680 --> 58:21.480
And then so later on in the day, I'm like, wait 1999

58:21.960 --> 58:24.280
How old was Scott Aaronson in 1999?

58:24.760 --> 58:27.800
And I think it was 18 or 19 and he was basically

58:29.000 --> 58:33.880
Proving from frontier results in complexity theory that were yeah, so at that point you're like

58:34.840 --> 58:38.680
All right, Aaronson's a special animal here. You are right. He's probably a special animal

58:39.000 --> 58:41.000
But it just it's just broadly good to know

58:42.040 --> 58:45.720
Just like have that sort of upper constraint on your dining Kruger that you can

58:46.440 --> 58:48.440
This exists in the world

58:48.920 --> 58:50.920
Maybe the thing that I would want to say is that

58:52.120 --> 58:55.560
Whatever the scale is on which he's two standard deviations above you

58:55.880 --> 59:01.080
That might not be the one scale that matters and that like contributions to these fields don't always look like

59:01.720 --> 59:03.720
genius insights and that

59:03.960 --> 59:11.320
Sometimes there's there's fruit to be born from say becoming kind of an expert in two different things and then finding connections between them and like

59:12.280 --> 59:16.280
The the people who make contributions are not necessarily the the Scott Aaronsons of the world

59:17.080 --> 59:19.080
Still you are probably

59:19.320 --> 59:21.000
The truth that there are

59:21.000 --> 59:24.440
It's like von Neumann's another example of one of these, right? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah

59:24.920 --> 59:28.040
Okay, how much does uh girdle's inclinus theorem

59:28.600 --> 59:34.360
Practically matter. Is it is it something that comes up a lot or is it just a interesting thing to know about the bounds that?

59:35.720 --> 59:37.320
Isn't day-to-day applicable

59:37.320 --> 59:42.280
You've asked me another question where I'm not the best one to ask and I should throw that um as a caveat to begin

59:42.760 --> 59:44.520
From what I understand

59:44.520 --> 59:49.000
It really doesn't come up. I mean the the analogy to make um

59:49.560 --> 59:55.080
The paradoxical fact that it's conveying the idea that you can't have an axiom system that is both um

59:55.960 --> 01:00:00.440
That will basically like prove all of the things that are true and which is also self-consistent

01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:05.800
The the contradiction that you construct out of that has the same feeling as the sentence

01:00:06.360 --> 01:00:10.520
This statement is a lie. Well, you know, you think about the statement if it's false, then it must be true

01:00:10.520 --> 01:00:11.960
If it's true, it must be false

01:00:11.960 --> 01:00:17.240
It's that same flavor and you might ask does the existence of that paradox mean that it's hard to speak english

01:00:18.600 --> 01:00:19.400
Yeah, that's interesting

01:00:19.400 --> 01:00:23.560
It's so rare that you would come up with something that happens to have a bit of self-reference in it

01:00:24.040 --> 01:00:25.240
there were

01:00:25.240 --> 01:00:27.240
One of the first times that there was something that came up

01:00:27.720 --> 01:00:33.800
That didn't feel quite as pathological in that way if the curious listener wants to go into it that search term would be

01:00:33.800 --> 01:00:35.800
Paris Harrington theorems where

01:00:36.520 --> 01:00:37.720
It's it's a little pathological

01:00:37.720 --> 01:00:43.640
But it wasn't the really a question that came up that didn't seem like it was deliberately constructed to be one of these

01:00:44.040 --> 01:00:46.040
self-referential things where you know

01:00:46.040 --> 01:00:49.800
It it shows itself to be outside the bounds of whatever axiom system

01:00:50.440 --> 01:00:55.800
You were starting with and it uh, so it was you know shown to be unresolvable in a certain sense

01:00:56.280 --> 01:01:01.080
But it it was asking a I don't want to say natural because a lot of these math

01:01:01.960 --> 01:01:06.360
Questions aren't natural in the sense that most people would want but it was asking a question where you wouldn't expect that to be true

01:01:06.760 --> 01:01:09.400
So maybe at the edges of theory there are sometimes when the

01:01:10.040 --> 01:01:15.000
Paradoxes that are possible if they curdles and possibility theorem shows like do eke their ways in

01:01:15.640 --> 01:01:20.120
The impression I get is no no mathematician is thinking about it. They're not actively worrying about it

01:01:20.120 --> 01:01:20.840
It's not like oh god

01:01:20.840 --> 01:01:25.400
No, like can I be sure that the stuff that i'm going to show us to for all the practical problems of it's like, you know

01:01:25.400 --> 01:01:29.400
The remand hypothesis or twin primes almost everyone's like no, there's going to be an answer

01:01:29.880 --> 01:01:31.320
like it

01:01:31.320 --> 01:01:37.080
Maybe they turn out to be unresolvable in in one of these uh ways, but like there's just a strong sense that

01:01:38.200 --> 01:01:40.200
That theorem came from a pathology

01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:42.360
in a way that

01:01:42.360 --> 01:01:44.920
Natural questions that people actually care about don't

01:01:45.640 --> 01:01:48.440
That's really interesting that something from the outside

01:01:49.240 --> 01:01:55.640
In and in popularizations is seems to be a very fundamental thing where people people have definitely heard about this, right?

01:01:56.040 --> 01:02:00.680
Is not internally a good a good analogy here is in computer science the halting problem

01:02:00.760 --> 01:02:03.240
it's like you take a computer science course one of the first things you'll learn is

01:02:03.800 --> 01:02:06.040
you know the proof of the halting problem and

01:02:07.080 --> 01:02:11.560
It's another one of those things where you don't really need to be able to prove that every single

01:02:12.040 --> 01:02:15.240
Or you have that sort of program available. Yeah

01:02:18.600 --> 01:02:20.600
No comment no more comment

01:02:21.880 --> 01:02:24.920
Why are good explanations so hard to find?

01:02:25.480 --> 01:02:27.480
Despite how useful they are

01:02:27.960 --> 01:02:29.560
Obviously, there's many other other than you as well

01:02:29.560 --> 01:02:34.040
There's many other cases of good explanations, but generally it just seems like there aren't as many as there should be

01:02:34.520 --> 01:02:36.520
Is it just a story of economics where it's nobody's?

01:02:37.080 --> 01:02:40.200
Incentive to be making really spend a lot of time making good explanations

01:02:40.280 --> 01:02:45.240
Is it just a really hard skill that isn't correlated with being able to come up with a discovery itself?

01:02:45.800 --> 01:02:49.080
What why are good explanations scarce? I think there's maybe two

01:02:50.280 --> 01:02:51.880
explanations

01:02:51.960 --> 01:02:55.480
The first less important one is going to be that there's a difference between

01:02:56.200 --> 01:02:59.240
Knowing something and then remembering what it's like not to know it

01:02:59.560 --> 01:03:03.400
And the character's difficult explanation is that you're walking someone on a path

01:03:03.800 --> 01:03:06.760
From the feeling of not understanding up to the feeling of understanding

01:03:07.480 --> 01:03:10.920
Earlier you were asking about societies that are that lack numeracy

01:03:11.400 --> 01:03:15.560
That's such a hard brain state to put yourself in like what's it like to not even know numbers?

01:03:15.800 --> 01:03:17.800
How would you start to explain what numbers are?

01:03:18.840 --> 01:03:21.480
Maybe you should go from a bunch of concrete examples, but like

01:03:21.960 --> 01:03:27.160
The way that you think about numbers and adding things it's just you have to really unpack a lot before you even start there

01:03:27.640 --> 01:03:30.520
And I think at higher levels of abstraction that becomes even harder

01:03:30.840 --> 01:03:35.320
Because it it shapes the way that you think so much that remembering what it's like not to understand it

01:03:35.800 --> 01:03:40.600
You're teaching some kid algebra and the premise of like a variable. They're like, what is x?

01:03:40.920 --> 01:03:45.320
You're like, well, it's it's it's not necessarily anything, but it's what we're solving for like yeah, but what is it?

01:03:45.560 --> 01:03:48.600
Like trying to answer what is x is a weirdly hard thing because it

01:03:49.240 --> 01:03:51.240
Is the premise that you're even starting from?

01:03:52.840 --> 01:03:56.520
The more important one probably is that the best explanation

01:03:56.920 --> 01:04:02.520
Depends heavily on the individual who's learning and the perfect explanation for you

01:04:04.280 --> 01:04:07.080
Often might be very different from the perfect explanation for someone else

01:04:07.240 --> 01:04:10.440
So there's a lot of very good domain specific explanations, you know

01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:16.200
Pull up in any textbook and like chapter 12 of it is probably explaining the content in there like quite well

01:04:16.440 --> 01:04:21.400
Assuming that you've read chapters one through 11, but if you're coming in from a cold start, it's a little bit hard

01:04:21.960 --> 01:04:27.480
And so the real gold nugget is like, how do you construct explanations which are as generally?

01:04:28.200 --> 01:04:31.000
Useful as possible as generally appealing as possible

01:04:31.800 --> 01:04:35.480
And that I think because you can't assume shared context it becomes this challenge

01:04:35.560 --> 01:04:38.200
and I think there's like tips and tricks along the way but

01:04:39.400 --> 01:04:44.360
Because the people that are often making explanations have a specific enough audience

01:04:44.600 --> 01:04:50.280
It is this classroom of 30 people or it's this discipline of majors who are in their third year

01:04:50.920 --> 01:04:56.440
All the explanations from the people who are professional explainers in some sense are so targeted that

01:04:57.080 --> 01:04:59.080
Maybe it's the economic thing you're talking about. There's not

01:04:59.880 --> 01:05:06.280
Or at least until recently in history. There hasn't been the need to or the incentive to come up with something that would be

01:05:06.680 --> 01:05:11.800
Um motivating and approachable and clear to an extremely wide variety of different backgrounds

01:05:12.360 --> 01:05:15.400
Is the process of making your videos is that mostly you?

01:05:16.200 --> 01:05:17.240
Okay

01:05:17.240 --> 01:05:21.000
Given the scale you're reaching it seems that if it was possible

01:05:22.840 --> 01:05:27.560
It would you know, just like a small increase in productivity would be worth like an entire production studio

01:05:28.040 --> 01:05:32.200
And it's interesting to me or surprising that the transaction cost of having

01:05:32.920 --> 01:05:38.920
A production setup are high enough that it's better to literally do the mundane details yourself

01:05:39.480 --> 01:05:40.600
Yeah, I mean

01:05:40.600 --> 01:05:45.080
This could honestly just be a personal flaw like i'm not good at um

01:05:45.640 --> 01:05:49.080
Pulling people in and then I've struggled to do this effectively in the past

01:05:49.560 --> 01:05:56.680
But a part of it is that the the seemingly mundane details are sometimes just how I even think about constructing it in the first place

01:05:57.960 --> 01:06:01.880
You know the first thing that a lot of youtubers will do if they can hire is hire an editor

01:06:02.200 --> 01:06:04.040
and this will be because

01:06:04.040 --> 01:06:07.960
They film a lot of things and so a lot of the editing process is removing the stuff that was

01:06:08.360 --> 01:06:11.560
Filmed that shouldn't be in the video and just leaving the stuff that should be in the video

01:06:11.800 --> 01:06:15.720
And that's time consuming and it's kind of mundane and it's probably not that relevant to

01:06:16.440 --> 01:06:19.560
What the creator should be thinking about when you're not filming stuff

01:06:19.960 --> 01:06:21.800
Like the the editing process for me

01:06:21.880 --> 01:06:25.160
You know I start by laying out all of the animations and stuff that I'll want in a timeline

01:06:25.400 --> 01:06:28.920
And then once I record the voice over the actual editing is like a day

01:06:29.400 --> 01:06:32.920
And it's not like I guess I could hire someone and gain a day back of my life

01:06:33.000 --> 01:06:38.360
But the the communication back and forth for saying what specifically I want like all of the little cuts that I'm making along the way

01:06:38.920 --> 01:06:44.280
Are my way of even thinking about what I want the final piece to be such that it would be hard to put it into words

01:06:44.920 --> 01:06:49.960
It's it's similar for why I maybe find it quite hard to use like a co-pilot and some of these like

01:06:51.480 --> 01:06:54.360
LLM tools and coding where for the animation code

01:06:54.440 --> 01:06:57.960
You know it can be super great if you're learning some new library and it knows about that library that you don't

01:06:58.040 --> 01:07:02.760
But for my library that I know inside it out if I'm just using it it feels like oh, this should be the most

01:07:03.480 --> 01:07:06.120
Automatable thing ever, you know, it's it's just text

01:07:06.520 --> 01:07:11.800
Like I should be the first youtuber who can actually do this better because the the substance behind each animation is text

01:07:11.880 --> 01:07:14.440
It's not like an editing workflow in quite the same way

01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:17.400
But it doesn't work and I think it's because

01:07:18.040 --> 01:07:18.840
um

01:07:18.840 --> 01:07:23.800
Maybe it's just because you need a multimodal thing that actually understands the look of the output like the output isn't

01:07:24.520 --> 01:07:28.440
Something that is consumable in text. It's something about how it looks, but at a deeper level

01:07:29.080 --> 01:07:32.120
I can't even put into words what I want to put on the screen

01:07:32.840 --> 01:07:37.160
Except to do so in code like that's just the way that I'm thinking about it and

01:07:38.120 --> 01:07:43.000
Like if I were to try to put into English the thing that I want as a comment that then gets expanded

01:07:43.640 --> 01:07:46.680
That task is actually harder than writing it in in the code

01:07:47.320 --> 01:07:52.360
And if it's clunky to write in code that's a sign that I should like change the interface of the library such that

01:07:52.360 --> 01:07:55.000
It's less clunky to be expressive in the way that I want

01:07:55.640 --> 01:07:58.920
And it's in that same way where a lot of the creative process

01:07:58.920 --> 01:08:00.920
Is

01:08:01.160 --> 01:08:03.160
That feels mundane

01:08:03.720 --> 01:08:08.360
Those are just like the cogs of thought slowly turning in a way that if they weren't turning for that part

01:08:08.360 --> 01:08:14.200
They would have to be turning during the interface of communication with a collaborator. Yeah on the point of working with

01:08:14.760 --> 01:08:16.760
co-pilot uh where

01:08:17.320 --> 01:08:23.240
We kind of visualized the changes you wanted to make there were the paper for microsoft research the sparks of hji paper

01:08:23.240 --> 01:08:28.600
had it actually really interesting example where it was generating letek and they

01:08:29.160 --> 01:08:35.400
You generated some output and they say change this so that the visual that comes up in the rendering is different in this way

01:08:35.800 --> 01:08:40.760
And it was actually able to do that which was their evidence that it can understand the higher level visual abstraction

01:08:41.480 --> 01:08:43.480
Um, so but I guess I can't do that for manum

01:08:44.120 --> 01:08:49.960
There's a couple reasons I might um, it might not be as fair a comparison one would be the two versions of manum

01:08:50.040 --> 01:08:54.440
There was a split where there's a community version that is you know by the community for the community

01:08:54.600 --> 01:08:57.080
And then mine the interfaces are largely similar

01:08:57.800 --> 01:08:59.800
The rendering engines are quite different

01:09:00.600 --> 01:09:02.600
But because of slight differences in that

01:09:03.240 --> 01:09:07.800
And you know it might have a tendency it learned from one or it saw examples from one and it's intermixing them

01:09:08.120 --> 01:09:10.680
So stuff just doesn't quite run when there's discrepancy

01:09:11.240 --> 01:09:16.840
I maybe shot myself in the foot where all of my code for videos like I don't really comment it that much because it's it's like a

01:09:16.840 --> 01:09:20.120
One and done deal it's if it's you know, there's also a

01:09:20.840 --> 01:09:23.640
for the core library I could comment and document a lot better, but like

01:09:24.520 --> 01:09:27.960
The way that I'm making it feels much more like the editing flow if you were to look at the

01:09:28.680 --> 01:09:33.800
Operation history of someone in after effects right like written down. It's a little bit more like that where

01:09:34.600 --> 01:09:39.720
There's not a perfect description in English of the thing that I want to do and then the execution of that

01:09:40.040 --> 01:09:42.440
It's just it's just the execution of that

01:09:42.920 --> 01:09:44.120
um

01:09:44.120 --> 01:09:49.560
And you know, it's it's not meant to be editable and hindsight as much because I'm just in the flow of making the scene for the one video

01:09:50.120 --> 01:09:50.760
and

01:09:50.760 --> 01:09:51.960
You know, maybe

01:09:51.960 --> 01:09:56.760
I could have given it a better chance to learn what it's supposed to be happening by having a really

01:09:57.320 --> 01:10:01.800
Well-documented set of like this is the input. This is the output. This is the comment describing it in English

01:10:02.360 --> 01:10:07.640
But even then that wouldn't hit the problem on like I would have to articulate what the thing I want is in the first place

01:10:08.280 --> 01:10:12.760
And the the language the program language is just the right mode of articulation in the first place

01:10:13.320 --> 01:10:17.560
This is something I wanted to I was really curious about ever since I learned about it

01:10:18.040 --> 01:10:23.480
I watched many of the summer of math exploration prize videos

01:10:24.120 --> 01:10:30.360
And it was shocking to me how good that I mean these looked like entire production studios were dedicated to making them

01:10:30.680 --> 01:10:34.600
Many of them and it was shocking to me that you could motivate and elicit

01:10:35.160 --> 01:10:37.160
This quality of contribution

01:10:37.320 --> 01:10:42.040
Given the relatively modest prize pool, which I was like five winners $1,000 each

01:10:42.280 --> 01:10:43.640
um

01:10:43.640 --> 01:10:49.480
What is your explanation of just running prizes like this? Why you were able to get such high quality contributions?

01:10:50.280 --> 01:10:54.280
Is it is it is a prize pool even relevant? Is it just about your reputation and reach?

01:10:54.680 --> 01:10:56.600
I do wonder how relevant the prize pool is

01:10:56.680 --> 01:11:00.200
I mean we've been thinking about this because you know, we did it first in 2021

01:11:00.200 --> 01:11:02.360
then we plan to continue doing it annually and

01:11:03.160 --> 01:11:04.680
I probably if I like

01:11:04.680 --> 01:11:09.400
Was a mover and a shaker could raise much more if I wanted to like get a big prize pool there

01:11:09.720 --> 01:11:15.320
I don't think it would change the quality of the content because the impression I get is that people aren't fundamentally motivated by

01:11:15.720 --> 01:11:17.400
Like winning some cash prize

01:11:17.400 --> 01:11:18.280
certainly

01:11:18.280 --> 01:11:19.640
They're not

01:11:19.640 --> 01:11:24.840
Investing with a like expected value calculation on what if they are that's a terrible terrible plan

01:11:25.000 --> 01:11:29.880
And if anything like that might be a problem like let's say it was $100,000 prize for each of the winners

01:11:30.280 --> 01:11:37.160
Then it would be a real problem where someone who and you know people do like to illusionally think that they're very likely going to be the winner

01:11:38.120 --> 01:11:43.080
They might like actually pour a lot of their own resources into it with the expectation of gaining it and then

01:11:43.800 --> 01:11:48.120
That's just a messy situation. I don't want to be in with like why wasn't mine chosen as a winner because

01:11:48.760 --> 01:11:50.760
The whole event is not supposed to be about

01:11:51.560 --> 01:11:52.920
winners in fact

01:11:52.920 --> 01:11:56.280
Maybe for listeners who don't know I should describe what you're talking about

01:11:56.760 --> 01:11:58.520
The summer of math exposition

01:11:58.520 --> 01:12:01.960
Actually, the the history is a little bit funny because it started with an intern application

01:12:02.360 --> 01:12:04.520
Where I in 2021 wanted to have

01:12:05.480 --> 01:12:09.560
Just like a couple interns to do a certain thing on my website basically and

01:12:10.360 --> 01:12:13.960
I put out a call for people to apply

01:12:14.360 --> 01:12:17.720
I got 2500 applicants and somewhere in the application

01:12:17.720 --> 01:12:21.080
I mentioned that during the summer in addition to like the main task I wanted them to do

01:12:21.800 --> 01:12:25.400
You know, I'd give freedom if they just wanted to do something relevant to math exposition online

01:12:25.480 --> 01:12:26.680
That was their own thing

01:12:26.680 --> 01:12:28.200
I'd be happy to provide

01:12:28.200 --> 01:12:33.000
You know some mentorship or just give them the freedom to do that one day a week and give me a little pitch on what your

01:12:33.160 --> 01:12:37.240
What your idea would be and as I went through, you know, all of the applications

01:12:38.040 --> 01:12:40.040
Which is a lot. Um, I

01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:45.000
Felt so bad because so often the person would have a little pitch and like what they would want to make

01:12:45.240 --> 01:12:47.240
And in my mind, I'd think cool

01:12:47.240 --> 01:12:52.440
You should make that you don't need me to like do that like just spend your summer making that why not?

01:12:53.000 --> 01:12:57.000
And people were clearly inspired by the thought of adding something and like I said earlier

01:12:57.800 --> 01:12:59.800
Being a youtuber is the most common

01:13:00.280 --> 01:13:03.080
Like job aspiration among the youth these days

01:13:04.120 --> 01:13:05.240
and so

01:13:05.240 --> 01:13:07.560
Is a consolation of sorts to those

01:13:08.280 --> 01:13:12.200
99% that I had to reject for the internship. I said, oh, but what we will do

01:13:13.080 --> 01:13:17.640
We're just gonna like host this thing. We'll call it the summer of math exposition where we'll give you a deadline

01:13:18.680 --> 01:13:21.640
I'll like promise to feature some people in a video

01:13:22.120 --> 01:13:24.280
maybe I'll choose five of them to do that and

01:13:24.920 --> 01:13:29.320
If you feel like the thing that you were going to do like with me as your 20 project as an intern is something

01:13:29.320 --> 01:13:33.720
You're excited about make it a hundred percent project or 20 percent or whatever whatever freedom you have

01:13:33.720 --> 01:13:38.760
just do it anyway and like I can give you this little carrot in the form of featuring it in a video and

01:13:39.480 --> 01:13:46.040
Give you a deadline which let's be honest is what actually makes the difference between people doing something and procrastinating on it sometimes

01:13:47.320 --> 01:13:53.160
Later there was I think it was brilliant that year said they would be happy to put some cash prizes in so I said sure. Why not?

01:13:53.560 --> 01:13:55.560
I don't think the cash prize

01:13:55.640 --> 01:14:01.080
Is super important, but it's nice. I mean it shows that someone actually cared and put some real thought into

01:14:01.560 --> 01:14:03.960
Doing something that wasn't just a made-up gold star

01:14:04.040 --> 01:14:08.200
But they put some material behind saying that you were selected as a winner of this thing

01:14:08.840 --> 01:14:11.480
But all in all it was never supposed to be about choosing winners

01:14:11.480 --> 01:14:14.920
It was just get more people to make stuff and if anything I'd actually

01:14:15.800 --> 01:14:22.200
I love it when I see stuff from existing educators and teachers where it's maybe not the youth who want to be youtubers

01:14:22.680 --> 01:14:28.120
Pouring their hearts and souls into it, but it's the educator who built up a lot of intuition over the course of their career

01:14:28.120 --> 01:14:31.880
For what constitutes a clear explanation and they're just sharing it more broadly

01:14:32.520 --> 01:14:33.640
so

01:14:33.640 --> 01:14:35.080
to your question on

01:14:35.080 --> 01:14:39.800
What is it that caused there to be such high production quality in some of the entries there

01:14:40.840 --> 01:14:47.480
Part of the answer might just be that like tooling is so good now that individuals can actually make pretty incredible things sometimes

01:14:48.040 --> 01:14:52.440
I misphrase if I said production quality. I might just meant the whole composition as a whole

01:14:52.920 --> 01:14:55.640
Yeah, well, there's a there's a selection filter too, right?

01:14:55.640 --> 01:14:58.760
Like there were in that first year 1,200 submissions

01:14:58.920 --> 01:15:02.200
I featured in you know the winning video five of them. So

01:15:02.840 --> 01:15:06.120
Of course, they're going they're necessarily

01:15:07.080 --> 01:15:08.920
Unrepresentative of the norm

01:15:08.920 --> 01:15:11.240
By the very nature of who I was choosing to feature

01:15:11.320 --> 01:15:15.480
But the fact that those were even in the pool something that high quality was even in the pool

01:15:15.960 --> 01:15:19.720
I think it hits a little bit to your miracle year point where I think

01:15:19.960 --> 01:15:26.120
What might be happening is you have people with a ton of potential energy for something that they've kind of been thinking about making for a

01:15:26.120 --> 01:15:27.160
long time

01:15:27.160 --> 01:15:32.120
And the hope was to give people a little push. Here's a deadline. Here's a little prize

01:15:32.280 --> 01:15:35.320
Here's a promise that maybe if you make it it won't just go into the void

01:15:35.480 --> 01:15:37.960
But there's a chance that it could it gets exposed to more people

01:15:38.200 --> 01:15:43.640
Which I think is absolutely played out and not for the reason that someone might expect where I choose winners

01:15:43.640 --> 01:15:45.640
And I feature those winners and people watch them

01:15:46.120 --> 01:15:48.280
a huge amount of viewership happens

01:15:49.400 --> 01:15:52.280
Before I even begin the process of looking at them

01:15:52.920 --> 01:15:57.480
And this was an accident too where in this first year we got 1,200 submissions

01:15:57.800 --> 01:16:02.440
I said expect judges who are reviewing it to spend at most 10 minutes on each piece

01:16:02.440 --> 01:16:06.200
So it could be longer, but like don't rely on someone watching it for more

01:16:06.600 --> 01:16:09.880
But realistically when I'm reviewing something I want to watch the whole piece. Um

01:16:10.600 --> 01:16:12.600
I absolutely do not have time to watch

01:16:14.600 --> 01:16:20.360
It takes I've learned it takes me about two weeks of just full-time work to like watch a hundred of these

01:16:21.000 --> 01:16:23.000
pieces and give the kind of feedback that I want

01:16:24.360 --> 01:16:26.120
and to

01:16:26.120 --> 01:16:29.320
To manage that problem of more than we could manually review

01:16:29.720 --> 01:16:35.960
We put together this peer review system that would basically have an algorithm feed people pairs of videos

01:16:35.960 --> 01:16:38.520
And they would just say which one is better and then it would feed them another one

01:16:38.920 --> 01:16:44.040
And in the first two years we we just used a tool that was common for hackathons that did this

01:16:44.600 --> 01:16:48.920
And what that did is one it gave us a partially ordered list of

01:16:50.120 --> 01:16:53.720
Content by quality loosely. We didn't need it to be perfect

01:16:53.720 --> 01:17:00.760
We just needed there to be a very high chance that the five most deserving videos were visible somewhere in that top 100, right?

01:17:01.080 --> 01:17:03.080
So there the algorithm doesn't have to be perfect

01:17:03.640 --> 01:17:05.800
but what happened I think is that

01:17:06.760 --> 01:17:10.280
By having this period when a ton of people are watching the same batch of videos

01:17:11.160 --> 01:17:14.840
So a thing I've learned about the youtube algorithm is in theory

01:17:14.840 --> 01:17:17.160
You would want to just use machine learning for everything, right?

01:17:17.240 --> 01:17:19.800
Like you have some massive neural network where on the input of it

01:17:19.960 --> 01:17:25.400
It's got five billion videos or however many exist and the output it decides what seven are best to recommend to you

01:17:25.720 --> 01:17:29.800
That is completely computationally infeasible, right? I also

01:17:30.760 --> 01:17:32.760
Think I think this is all public knowledge

01:17:33.640 --> 01:17:37.640
But so what you have to do instead is use some sort of proxies

01:17:38.120 --> 01:17:43.000
As a first pass to nominate a video to even be fed into the machine learning driven algorithm

01:17:43.240 --> 01:17:47.800
So that you're only feeding in like a thousand or so or something in the order of thousands like nominees

01:17:48.280 --> 01:17:49.880
so the real

01:17:49.880 --> 01:17:54.680
Difference that it can make if you've made a really good video between it getting to the people who would like it

01:17:55.000 --> 01:17:59.240
And not getting there. It's not the flaws in the algorithm. The algorithm is probably quite good

01:17:59.640 --> 01:18:05.160
It's the mismatch between the proxies being used to nominate stuff to see whether it's even in the running

01:18:05.640 --> 01:18:08.280
So one of the things used for nomination is

01:18:09.000 --> 01:18:15.320
Understanding the co-watch graph where if you've watched video a and you've also watched video b and then I watch video a

01:18:16.040 --> 01:18:18.920
Your watching both of those gives a little link between them

01:18:19.000 --> 01:18:22.120
Or maybe you and a ton of other people watching both of them gives a little link between

01:18:22.440 --> 01:18:24.440
such that once I watch video a

01:18:24.680 --> 01:18:27.880
b is potentially nominated in that phase because

01:18:28.600 --> 01:18:30.600
You know, it's recognized that there's a lot of co-watching

01:18:30.920 --> 01:18:33.960
That's something that I'm sure still is like quite challenging at scale

01:18:34.040 --> 01:18:37.160
But it's more plausible to do at scale than like running some massive neural network

01:18:37.640 --> 01:18:44.200
And so I think what might have happened is that by having a bunch of co-watching happening on this same pool of videos

01:18:44.680 --> 01:18:49.400
All you need is for like some of them to have decent reach and get recommended, right?

01:18:49.640 --> 01:18:51.240
Because then that kicks off

01:18:51.240 --> 01:18:57.400
It's like igniting a pile of kindling where then if others are good if they're going to give people good experiences

01:18:57.880 --> 01:19:03.080
They get not only nominated but then recommended which then like kicks back in the feedback loop there

01:19:03.800 --> 01:19:04.840
so

01:19:04.840 --> 01:19:06.840
That turns out to be

01:19:07.160 --> 01:19:12.520
I think as close to a guarantee as you can get of saying if you make something that's good

01:19:12.920 --> 01:19:15.560
It's a good piece that will satisfy someone

01:19:16.120 --> 01:19:20.200
They come away feeling like they learned something that they otherwise didn't know and it was well presented

01:19:21.160 --> 01:19:26.920
If you can get it into this peer review process, it will reach people. It's not just going to be shouting into the void

01:19:27.800 --> 01:19:29.800
And and in this case, you know, there was last year

01:19:29.960 --> 01:19:34.440
I think over 100 videos where after the first two weeks they had more than 10,000 views

01:19:34.680 --> 01:19:38.760
Which I know in the grand scheme people think like huge numbers of views and millions out there, but like for a

01:19:39.320 --> 01:19:41.320
for a fresh channel

01:19:41.320 --> 01:19:46.520
Talking about a niche mathematical topic to be able to put it out and like get 10,000 people to watch it

01:19:46.600 --> 01:19:51.400
I think is amazing, right and the idea that that could happen for over 100 people. I think is amazing

01:19:51.800 --> 01:19:52.840
so

01:19:52.840 --> 01:19:56.520
That had nothing to do with the prize pool, right in in that

01:19:57.480 --> 01:19:58.840
the

01:19:58.840 --> 01:20:03.800
The motive might have been a hope of like actually getting some reach and having some sense of a guarantee of there being some reach

01:20:04.760 --> 01:20:10.040
Ironically the reason to do the whole peer review system in the first place is in the service of selecting winners

01:20:10.040 --> 01:20:13.160
And so like without something in the service of selecting winners

01:20:13.160 --> 01:20:18.280
If you just said hey, we're having a watch fest where everyone watches each other's things somehow it wouldn't quite have the same like

01:20:19.160 --> 01:20:21.080
I don't know poll that gets people into it

01:20:21.240 --> 01:20:24.680
So I think it still makes sense to have winners and to have some material behind those winners

01:20:25.400 --> 01:20:28.920
It doesn't have to be much though. And if anything, I think it might ruin it to make it too much

01:20:29.400 --> 01:20:35.080
I'll also say it's $15,000 actually because we will give $500 to 20 different honorable mentions

01:20:35.800 --> 01:20:37.080
at least this year

01:20:37.080 --> 01:20:38.360
so

01:20:38.360 --> 01:20:40.280
Still pretty modest in the scheme

01:20:40.280 --> 01:20:43.880
There's like how much money you can invest to try to get more math lessons in the world

01:20:44.440 --> 01:20:49.000
I watch many of the honorable mentions as well because they were just topics that are interesting to me and

01:20:50.200 --> 01:20:50.840
I mean

01:20:50.840 --> 01:20:55.880
It's like the thing that the president of chicago university said at one point where he said we could discard the people

01:20:55.880 --> 01:21:00.280
We admitted and select the next thousand for our class and there would be no difference. It was that level of

01:21:01.560 --> 01:21:05.960
You know your yeah, that level of peak. Yeah, and I really admire by the way

01:21:06.600 --> 01:21:09.880
Not only the education that you're provided directly with your videos

01:21:09.880 --> 01:21:11.000
Which have reached millions of people

01:21:11.000 --> 01:21:14.920
But the fact that you're also setting up this way of getting more people to contribute

01:21:15.240 --> 01:21:17.800
And maybe get to topics that you wouldn't have time to get to yourself

01:21:17.800 --> 01:21:19.880
So I like I really admire that you're doing that

01:21:20.600 --> 01:21:22.600
If you're self teaching yourself a field

01:21:23.000 --> 01:21:26.920
That involves mathematics. Let's say it's physics or some other thing like that

01:21:28.040 --> 01:21:34.520
There's problems where you have to understand. How do I put this in terms of a dirt of an integral?

01:21:35.000 --> 01:21:38.920
and from there it's can I solve this integral and

01:21:40.440 --> 01:21:43.560
What would you recommend to somebody who is teaching themselves?

01:21:43.960 --> 01:21:47.720
Let's say quantum mechanics and they I figured out how to put how to get the right

01:21:48.200 --> 01:21:52.840
Mathematical equation here. Is it important for their understanding to be able to take go from there to

01:21:53.560 --> 01:21:57.720
Getting it to the end result or can they just say well, I can just abstract that out. I understand the broader

01:21:59.000 --> 01:22:01.240
Way to set up the problem in terms of the physics itself

01:22:01.800 --> 01:22:08.920
I think where a lot of self learners shoot themselves in the foot is by skipping calculations by by thinking that that's

01:22:10.200 --> 01:22:12.360
incidental to the core understanding

01:22:12.760 --> 01:22:18.440
But actually you I think you do build a lot of intuition just by putting in the reps of certain calculations

01:22:19.640 --> 01:22:24.840
Some of them maybe turn out not to be all that important and in that case. Okay, so be it but sometimes

01:22:25.720 --> 01:22:28.360
that's what maybe shapes your sense of

01:22:29.240 --> 01:22:31.960
Where the substance of a result really came from

01:22:32.680 --> 01:22:33.880
I don't know it might be something you realize

01:22:33.880 --> 01:22:39.080
Oh, it's because of the square root that you get this decay and if you didn't like really go through the exercise

01:22:39.160 --> 01:22:42.280
You would just instead coming away thinking like such and such decays

01:22:42.280 --> 01:22:46.440
But with other circumstances it doesn't decay and like not really understanding what was

01:22:47.000 --> 01:22:52.600
The core part of this, you know high level result. That is the thing you actually want to come out remembering

01:22:53.480 --> 01:22:57.080
Like putting in the work with the calculations is where you solidify all of those

01:22:57.720 --> 01:22:59.400
underlying intuitions

01:22:59.400 --> 01:23:01.720
And without the forcing function of homework

01:23:02.840 --> 01:23:04.840
People we just like don't do it

01:23:04.920 --> 01:23:10.280
So that I think that's one thing that I learned is a big difference post college versus during college

01:23:11.240 --> 01:23:15.800
Is like post college. It's very easy in learning stuff to just accidentally skip that and then

01:23:16.920 --> 01:23:18.440
It doesn't sink in as well

01:23:18.440 --> 01:23:24.920
So I think when you're reading something having a notebook next to you just like having pen and paper pencil and paper whatever it is

01:23:25.640 --> 01:23:27.960
Should be considered part of the actual reading process

01:23:28.360 --> 01:23:32.200
And if you are relying too much on like reading and kind of looking up and thinking in your head

01:23:33.000 --> 01:23:38.280
You know, maybe that's going to get something but it's it's not going to be as highly leveraged as it could be

01:23:38.680 --> 01:23:45.000
What will be the what would be the impact of more self teaching in terms of what kinds of personalities benefit most?

01:23:45.400 --> 01:23:46.360
so

01:23:46.360 --> 01:23:49.400
There's obviously a difference in the kind of person who benefits most

01:23:50.120 --> 01:23:54.600
In a situation where there's it's a college course and everybody has to do the homework, but maybe some people are better

01:23:55.880 --> 01:23:58.760
tuned for the kind of work that's placed there versus

01:23:59.560 --> 01:24:03.560
All this stuff is available for you on youtube and then textbooks for exercises and so on

01:24:03.640 --> 01:24:06.760
But you have to have the conscientiousness to actually go ahead and pursue it

01:24:07.880 --> 01:24:09.880
I mean, how do you see the

01:24:09.960 --> 01:24:15.080
Distribution of who will benefit from the more modern way in which you can get whatever you want

01:24:15.320 --> 01:24:17.320
But you have to push yourself to get it

01:24:17.400 --> 01:24:22.200
There's a really good book that's actually kind of relevant to some of your early questions called failure to disrupt

01:24:22.360 --> 01:24:25.080
That goes over the history of educational technology

01:24:25.640 --> 01:24:30.680
Trying to answer the question you have these repeated cycles of people saying such and such technology that

01:24:31.640 --> 01:24:34.120
Almost always is getting more explanations to more people

01:24:34.840 --> 01:24:39.800
Promises that it'll disrupt the existing university system or disrupt the existing school system and just kind of never does

01:24:40.520 --> 01:24:43.320
You know, one of the things that it highlights is how stratifying

01:24:44.040 --> 01:24:47.400
These technologies will be in that they actually are very very good

01:24:47.880 --> 01:24:52.520
for those who are already motivated or kind of already on the top in some way and

01:24:53.240 --> 01:24:54.520
They end up

01:24:54.520 --> 01:24:56.040
Struggling the most

01:24:56.040 --> 01:24:58.040
Just for those who are performing more poorly

01:24:58.280 --> 01:25:04.120
And maybe it's because of confounding causation where the same thing that causes someone to not do poorly in the traditional system

01:25:04.120 --> 01:25:08.040
Also means that they're not going to engage as well with the the plethora of tools available

01:25:09.000 --> 01:25:14.120
I don't know if this answers your question, but I would reemphasize that what's probably most important

01:25:14.920 --> 01:25:19.800
To getting people to actually learn something is not the explanation or the quality of explanations available

01:25:19.880 --> 01:25:22.360
Because since the printing press that has been

01:25:23.560 --> 01:25:27.560
Not not literally true because maybe access to libraries and such as as universal as you would want

01:25:27.800 --> 01:25:31.560
But like people had access to the explanation once they were motivated

01:25:32.040 --> 01:25:33.480
but instead

01:25:33.480 --> 01:25:36.120
It's going to be the social factors like are the are the

01:25:36.680 --> 01:25:41.880
Five best friends that you have also interested in the stuff and do they tend to push you up or they tend to pull you down

01:25:41.880 --> 01:25:47.640
When it comes to learning more things or do you ever a reason to there's a job that you want to get or domain that you want

01:25:47.640 --> 01:25:52.120
To enter where you just have to understand something is there a personal project that you're doing like

01:25:52.920 --> 01:25:56.840
the existence of compelling personal projects and

01:25:58.200 --> 01:26:05.720
Encouraging friend groups probably does way way more than the average quality of explanation online ever could

01:26:06.280 --> 01:26:10.520
Because once you get someone motivated one, they're just they're going to learn it

01:26:10.920 --> 01:26:14.520
It maybe makes it a more fluid process if there's good explanations versus bad ones

01:26:14.600 --> 01:26:17.480
And it keeps you from having some people drop out of that process

01:26:17.800 --> 01:26:19.000
Which is important

01:26:19.000 --> 01:26:21.400
But if you're not motivating them into it in the first place

01:26:21.880 --> 01:26:27.640
It doesn't matter if you have the you know most world-class explanations on every possible topic out there

01:26:28.360 --> 01:26:31.320
It's uh, it's it's screaming into a void effectively

01:26:31.960 --> 01:26:36.360
And I don't I don't know the best way to get more people to um no things I I have had a thought

01:26:37.000 --> 01:26:39.400
This this is the kind of thing that could never be done in practice

01:26:39.480 --> 01:26:42.120
But instead it's something you would like write some kind of novel about

01:26:42.600 --> 01:26:44.600
Where if you want the perfect school

01:26:44.680 --> 01:26:49.320
Right something where you can insert some students and then you want them to get the best education that you can

01:26:50.040 --> 01:26:51.560
what you need to do

01:26:51.560 --> 01:26:55.720
Is let's say it's a high school you insert a lot of like

01:26:57.160 --> 01:27:03.560
Really attractive high schooler plants as actors that you like get the students to develop crushes

01:27:03.880 --> 01:27:09.640
On the various plants right and then anything that you want to learn the plant has to express a certain interest in it

01:27:09.640 --> 01:27:15.320
They're like oh, they're really interested in Charles Dickens or something right and they express this interest and then they

01:27:15.640 --> 01:27:20.200
You know suggest that they would become more interested in whoever your target student is if they

01:27:20.680 --> 01:27:24.040
Also read the dickens with them. They're also were like interested in learning the physics

01:27:24.440 --> 01:27:27.800
Like if you get that in a way, you know, you socially engineer this setting

01:27:28.520 --> 01:27:35.640
The effectiveness that that would have to get students to actually learn stuff is probably so many miles above anything else that we

01:27:35.640 --> 01:27:39.960
Could do that nothing like that in practice could ever actually literally work

01:27:40.200 --> 01:27:43.080
But at least viewing that as this end point of okay

01:27:43.560 --> 01:27:46.920
This mode of interaction would be hyper effective at education

01:27:47.320 --> 01:27:52.600
Is there anything that kind of gets at that right and so okay the kind of things that get at that it would be

01:27:54.120 --> 01:27:59.800
Being cognizant of your child's peer group or something which is think something that parents. I think very naturally do or

01:28:00.520 --> 01:28:03.720
Okay, it doesn't have to be a romantic crush, but it could be that there's

01:28:04.280 --> 01:28:05.880
There's respect for the teacher, right?

01:28:05.880 --> 01:28:09.000
It's someone that they genuinely respect and look up to such that when they say

01:28:09.400 --> 01:28:13.880
There's an an edification to come from read reading dickens that that actually lands in a way

01:28:15.080 --> 01:28:16.840
and so

01:28:16.840 --> 01:28:19.880
Taking that as a paragon and then letting everything else approximate that

01:28:21.000 --> 01:28:27.160
Has I would emphasize nothing to do with the quality of online explanations that there are out there

01:28:27.480 --> 01:28:33.720
That at best just makes it such that you know, you can you can lubricate the process once someone's sufficiently interested

01:28:33.880 --> 01:28:35.880
You found a new replica use case

01:28:35.880 --> 01:28:37.880
yes, I mean

01:28:37.880 --> 01:28:39.880
I'm not saying we should do it, but

01:28:40.840 --> 01:28:42.840
Think of how effective that would be

01:28:43.080 --> 01:28:46.280
Uh, okay final question. This is something I should have followed up on earlier

01:28:46.680 --> 01:28:50.280
But your plans to become a high school teacher for some amount of years

01:28:50.840 --> 01:28:54.360
When you're planning on doing that and what do you hope to get out of that? I would say no concrete plans

01:28:54.440 --> 01:28:59.560
I would say it would I wouldn't want to do it in a period where like I also have young children

01:29:00.760 --> 01:29:03.000
And therefore it would make sense to like

01:29:03.960 --> 01:29:05.720
Maybe a lot of people will say this kind of thing

01:29:05.720 --> 01:29:10.360
But there's friends of mine who think when their child is in like, um, you know high school

01:29:10.360 --> 01:29:12.200
That's that's when they would want to be a high school teacher

01:29:12.600 --> 01:29:14.760
I think two two things I would want to get out of it one of them

01:29:15.480 --> 01:29:21.240
As I was emphasizing I think you just lose touch with what it's like not to know stuff or what it's like to be a student

01:29:21.560 --> 01:29:27.960
And so maintaining that kind of connection so that I don't become dollar and dollar over time feels important the other

01:29:28.920 --> 01:29:30.920
I would like to

01:29:32.040 --> 01:29:37.640
Live in a world where more people who are savvy with STEM spend some of their time teaching

01:29:37.960 --> 01:29:43.320
Um, I just think that's one of the highest leverage ways that you can think of to actually get more people to engage with math

01:29:44.040 --> 01:29:46.040
And so I would like to

01:29:46.040 --> 01:29:48.840
Encourage people to do that and call that call to action

01:29:49.800 --> 01:29:50.920
Um

01:29:50.920 --> 01:29:54.760
Some some notion of spending maybe not your whole career, but a little bit of time

01:29:55.400 --> 01:29:59.160
In teaching there's not as fluid a system for doing that as say

01:29:59.640 --> 01:30:04.440
You know going through a tour of service in certain certain countries where everyone like spends two years in the military

01:30:04.920 --> 01:30:07.320
So shy of having a system like that for education

01:30:07.400 --> 01:30:10.120
There's all these kind of ad hoc things where you know

01:30:10.120 --> 01:30:14.520
Charter schools might have like an emergency credential system to like get a science teacher in

01:30:14.920 --> 01:30:17.800
Um, but there's a you know teach for america is something out there

01:30:17.800 --> 01:30:24.120
there's enough ways that someone could spend a little bit of time that's probably not fully saturated at this point that

01:30:24.440 --> 01:30:27.160
You know the world would be better if more people did that and

01:30:28.040 --> 01:30:32.760
It would be hypocritical for me to suggest that and then not to actually put my uh, but my

01:30:33.400 --> 01:30:35.400
Feet where my words are

01:30:35.720 --> 01:30:40.600
Yeah, well, uh, I think that's a great note to leave it on grant. Um, thanks so much for coming on the podcast

01:30:40.680 --> 01:30:44.920
And genuinely, I mean you you're one of the people I really really admire but what you've done for the

01:30:45.880 --> 01:30:49.080
The landscape of math education is it mean it's really remarkable. So

01:30:49.800 --> 01:30:52.280
This is a pleasure to talk to you. Thanks for saying that I had a lot of fun

01:30:53.880 --> 01:30:56.280
