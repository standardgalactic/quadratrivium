{"text": " I challenge the claim that next token prediction cannot surpass human performance. It looks like on the surface, it cannot. It looks on the surface, if you just learn to imitate, to predict what people do, it means that you can only copy people. But there here is a counter argument for why it might not be quite so if your neural net is, if your base neural net is smart enough, you just ask it like, what would what would a person with like great insight and wisdom and capability do? Maybe such a person doesn't exist. But there's a pretty good chance that the neural net will be able to extrapolate how such a person would behave. Do you see what I mean? Yes, although where would it get the sort of insight about what that's a person would do, if not from from the data of regular people? Because like, if you think about it, what does it mean to predict the next token well enough? What does it mean? Actually, it's actually it's a much it's a deeper question than it seems. Predicting the next token well means that you understand the underlying reality that led to the creation of that token. It's not statistics like it is statistics, but what is statistics? In order to on to understand those statistics to compress them, you need to understand what is it about the world that creates this those statistics. And so then you say, Okay, well, I have all those people. What is it about people that creates their behaviors? Well, they have, you know, they have thoughts and they have feelings and they have ideas and they do things in certain ways. All of those would be deduced from next token prediction. And I'd argue that this should make it possible, not indefinitely, but to a to a pretty decent degree to say well, can you guess what you what you do if you took a person with like this characteristic and that characteristic, like such a person doesn't exist. But because you're so good at predicting the next token, you should still be able to guess what that person would do this hypothetical imaginary person means far greater mental ability than the rest of us.", "segments": [{"id": 0, "seek": 0, "start": 0.0, "end": 3.04, "text": " I challenge the claim that next token prediction cannot", "tokens": [50364, 286, 3430, 264, 3932, 300, 958, 14862, 17630, 2644, 50516], "temperature": 0.0, "avg_logprob": -0.16211189996628533, "compression_ratio": 1.7758620689655173, "no_speech_prob": 0.026252852752804756}, {"id": 1, "seek": 0, "start": 3.04, "end": 8.56, "text": " surpass human performance.
