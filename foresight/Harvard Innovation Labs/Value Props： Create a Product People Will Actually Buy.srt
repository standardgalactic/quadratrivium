1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:12,560
Value props is one of the most important things that we could possibly spend time on because

2
00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:16,840
the number one reason that companies fail is because they're not solving a valuable

3
00:00:16,840 --> 00:00:21,920
enough problem and therefore they don't create the value that's worth investing in and therefore

4
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:25,720
they fail in their basic form of meeting a need.

5
00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:30,280
So what we intend to do today is to both help you understand how to define the problem

6
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:35,000
you're addressing or the opportunity you see and then actually evaluate it and then finally

7
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,600
create it.

8
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:39,800
And this is one of the few workshops where I'll tell you that we do have an answer.

9
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:43,320
Usually you hear me say there are no answers that I'm going to ask a whole bunch of questions

10
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:44,320
of you.

11
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:46,960
The only answer I'm giving you though is a framework and it's a framework for where

12
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:47,960
we're going to go.

13
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:52,200
So let me jump right in and get you there so you can hear exactly from the beginning

14
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:55,240
how this framework set of activities is going to come together.

15
00:00:55,240 --> 00:00:58,760
So as I said first of all we're going to define then we're going to evaluate then we're

16
00:00:58,760 --> 00:00:59,880
going to build.

17
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:02,920
One of the things I want to tell you right off the bat is that I want to get rid of the

18
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:05,720
idea of ideas.

19
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:09,160
It's a terrible thing but most people come to me and they say I've got an incredible

20
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:10,360
idea for X, Y and Z.

21
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:15,520
Well ideas are to a penny, sorry I should say to a cent but what they really are is

22
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:16,520
free floating.

23
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:20,400
They don't actually have meaning until you can address some kind of a problem or opportunity

24
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:21,400
with them.

25
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:23,680
So that's why that first part is so important.

26
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:26,880
And then of course once you start building a value proposition we want to be able to

27
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:30,920
evaluate it so you yourself not me or anybody else can judge whether you've got something

28
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:34,080
that is really going to be compelling and cause people to buy.

29
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:37,080
And finally if you have then of course you want to build it and get it into a form that's

30
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:38,080
really crisp.

31
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:42,080
So it's an easy thing for you to do and everything from an elevator pitch to literally going

32
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:46,200
to a full on pitch for example to get a customer over the line or raise money.

33
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:50,360
In every instance though this framework, a set of frameworks should help you get that.

34
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:52,800
So I said we'd give you an answer.

35
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:55,640
This is the end of the session.

36
00:01:55,640 --> 00:02:02,920
We want you to be able to actually build this framework and say for who that is dissatisfied

37
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:09,800
with what due to some unmet need or problem you offer a product that solves that and it

38
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:13,320
provides some key benefits that are compelling enough that people actually want to engage

39
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:14,520
with you.

40
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:17,960
So that's why we're headed this evening.

41
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:21,280
First thing in the value prop that we want to do is define.

42
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:26,000
The first statement sounds so obvious which is for who.

43
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,640
So I'm going to jump right in because I know that they've got a good starting point.

44
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:31,320
Connect Ed Gulnaz.

45
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:34,880
Tell me for who is your value prop.

46
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:43,240
So this is connected as a nonprofit so we bridge the digital divide for people in Kazakhstan

47
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:50,200
but we have to deliver I feel like the value proposition for organization that donate their

48
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:54,800
computers and devices to us and those who can fund us.

49
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:59,560
Okay so you went long way down into that but I want to make sure we really understand the

50
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:00,560
who.

51
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:04,680
So if you could say who it is for is it everybody in Kazakhstan?

52
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:05,680
Primarily children.

53
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:11,280
Okay so we want to say children okay.

54
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:14,360
What else could you say about them?

55
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:18,320
From marginalized communities and rural areas in Kazakhstan.

56
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:20,720
Okay marginalized.

57
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:21,720
What else?

58
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:27,120
Who don't have basic digital literacy skills.

59
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:39,600
Okay so basic digital literacy skills.

60
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:41,520
And you said the last thing is.

61
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:43,120
And they don't have equipment.

62
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:46,920
And they don't have equipment.

63
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:51,120
So this is why I picked Gulnaz because I've been lucky enough to have her in the class

64
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:52,120
before.

65
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:56,520
She didn't say my proposition is for everybody which would be very terrifying if it was by

66
00:03:56,520 --> 00:04:00,760
the way because then how do you even pick where you go to market or how you reach that

67
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:01,760
customer etc.

68
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:03,240
She's got very specific.

69
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:07,680
I didn't write Kazakhstan because that's pretty obvious but it's children with marginalized

70
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:11,720
who are in a marginalized situation don't have basic digital literacy and they don't

71
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:12,960
have the equipment.

72
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:16,360
Now we can find out later how she's going to address their needs.

73
00:04:16,520 --> 00:04:18,360
That's pretty clear right.

74
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:24,200
So anyway one of the teams at the iLab who put their value prop in for tonight was Comprofacil

75
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:29,800
and they very openly said they've got a product which is going to help people who are dissatisfied

76
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:34,720
with current credit products due to high interest rates get through a credit marketplace better

77
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:36,920
comparison capabilities.

78
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:39,600
Makes total sense but they didn't say for who.

79
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:43,800
Now that's a massive problem when you are building a business because if you don't know

80
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:47,800
who your customer is you don't know what the persona is that you're selling to and

81
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:50,520
how to focus or target on them etc.

82
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:55,840
And it just is the beginning therefore of why the value proposition statement is so important.

83
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:58,080
I will underline it by saying the following.

84
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:01,280
If you don't know who your customer is and you think it's everybody I can tell you you're

85
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:06,480
going to fail by default because trying to boil the ocean and sell to the world at large

86
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:09,760
is a very big undertaking for any company.

87
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:12,520
Even the largest companies in the world get very crisp about it.

88
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:14,080
Yeah and Tato.

89
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:19,760
Yeah I had a question and I think related to Golnath's business.

90
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:25,000
If your user is different from your customer who do you put on the for who?

91
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,320
Great question.

92
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:28,840
So user versus customer.

93
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:31,200
What do you think is the answer first of all?

94
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:37,560
Golnath will answer.

95
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:38,560
Anybody can answer.

96
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:39,560
Does anybody in the room have an answer to this?

97
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:41,680
This is a terrifically good question by the way.

98
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:45,240
This is the kind of thing that we really need to deal with too.

99
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:47,120
The user say more.

100
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:48,120
Why the user?

101
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:52,760
Well because customer is just the person who's paying it but user is who's benefiting

102
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:54,920
from what you're creating.

103
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:55,920
Great.

104
00:05:55,920 --> 00:06:01,040
Now does it mean that one or the other?

105
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:02,440
Or are both important?

106
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:04,040
Anybody else want to comment on this?

107
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:05,360
Yes go ahead.

108
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:09,400
I think when your user is not your customer you actually have to satisfy two different

109
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:10,400
value propositions.

110
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:14,600
You have to provide value to the initial funder whether that's philanthropy or government

111
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:18,880
but you also have to provide value to the user so you have uptake.

112
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:20,200
Okay.

113
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:21,920
So this is really important.

114
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:24,720
This which is I'll just use the word pull.

115
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:25,720
You need the pull from the user.

116
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:28,400
If the user's not using it nobody's going to pay for it.

117
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:33,880
But even if the user is using it the person who's got to pay for it whether it's a government

118
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:39,080
if it's a non-profit situation or it's somebody in IT for example who's the gatekeep of something

119
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:43,560
they still are going to need the user to convince them that there is a payoff that makes it

120
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:45,960
worth them investing in this product or service.

121
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:49,880
So both are important but I really agree with Victor by the way you've got to start with

122
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:50,880
the user.

123
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:54,240
Like if the user is just not getting the value from your value proposition that's the whole

124
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:57,640
point of this class then we're in the wrong place.

125
00:06:57,640 --> 00:07:04,400
So this piece of definition is what we're trying to get to with the who and when you

126
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:08,120
see and by the way I don't think we have it this semester but the startup secrets class

127
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:12,080
on go to market which by the way is on the iLib YouTube channel.

128
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:16,360
You will see we talk about personas and this is one of the things that we talk about is

129
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:23,080
how do you get to all parts of the persona that is going to be the champion for your

130
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:28,000
product or service in whatever enterprise or government or non-profit you're selling

131
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
to.

132
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,560
So very important question thank you very much for that.

133
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:34,720
Any other questions on who before we move on?

134
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:35,720
All right good.

135
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:39,560
The key word here is ultimately segment.

136
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:42,480
So if we're not going to sell to everybody we need to find a segment of people that we're

137
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:47,320
going to sell to and the trick of this is actually in your workbook so I'm not going

138
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:51,160
to pitch it to you tonight because it's a significant thing to go and spend some time

139
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:55,160
looking at and that is to define your minimum viable segment.

140
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:59,760
I'll just define it for you as simply as this which is to say you're all going to get to

141
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:06,280
learn about building the smallest product you possibly can your MVP and if the whole

142
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:11,920
market out there the whole world was where you went and targeted that then this would

143
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:15,680
very quickly get pulled in all sorts of different directions for all the potential users that

144
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:19,280
could use your product or service and they all have different needs.

145
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:25,400
The MVS simply says you want to find one path where you get the same needs for the same

146
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:31,560
users that allows you to sell the same product over and over and over and over and over again

147
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:34,120
without you having to change the product.

148
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:38,280
You can learn a lot more about that in the workbook but that's the notion of a segment

149
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:46,800
and if you do this right then you end up with a minimum viable segment which is a good dance

150
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:49,480
partner as I call it to your minimum viable product.

151
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:53,840
Now does anybody in the room not know what these two terms are because they are terms

152
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:58,000
that have been built in start-up legacy for the last decade or so but it doesn't mean

153
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,800
to say everybody knows them.

154
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:02,200
Anybody have any questions on those?

155
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:03,400
All right good.

156
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:09,240
So only secret I want to give you here is one simple one which is you want to evaluate

157
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:13,920
this part of your who you're selling to through the eyes of the customer.

158
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:17,560
So we talked about who this is let's just focus on the user.

159
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:22,120
If the user can identify with the product you're selling you're on the right track.

160
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:27,280
What's the best way to find that out?

161
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:35,040
Yeah absolutely all of you can do this without spending a single penny just go out and talk

162
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:39,840
to them and if you're not clear that your user is identifying when you talk to them

163
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:43,360
with what you're trying to sell them they say well that's not me I don't buy that or

164
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:48,640
I don't need that or that's not a problem I identify with keep asking until you find

165
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:54,120
the person who says oh yeah that's the problem I have and keep asking until they say not

166
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:57,640
only do I have it but then that's where we'll start to get into more of the value proposition

167
00:09:57,640 --> 00:10:01,440
but it's the pain there is big enough for me to actually start to engage with you but

168
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:06,400
everything you do should be looked at from your user's eyes not from yours in other words

169
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:12,400
don't pitch them anything ask them everything make sense I see a lot of nodding heads good

170
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:17,160
all pretty obvious so now that we've we've talked about defining who it's for we're

171
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:21,240
going to define what we're going to solve for them what problem we're going to define

172
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:26,880
for them so there's a famous statement here and it's one of my favorite which is a problem

173
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:32,680
well stated is half solved and the reason that's true is that if you can really clearly

174
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:37,280
identify what the pain or need or opportunity is that you're going to address becomes very

175
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:41,880
easy to start getting your team to focus on well what product or service will you build

176
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:45,800
but imagine if you get in the room and the opposite is true there's five engineers you've

177
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:50,560
hired for argument sake or five people you're working on a service building a service for

178
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:55,560
and you can't even agree what it is you're building and or if you didn't do the first

179
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:59,320
part who you're building it for that's where a lot of startups go wrong by the way is they

180
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:05,040
can't get that crisp to say we need to solve this particular pain point this hair on fire

181
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:11,320
pain point for people first so now the question is what's the best way to go about doing that

182
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:17,480
here are a few frameworks for you first of all this one is a very simple one it's for

183
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:27,200
use think about problems that are unworkable unavoidable urgent and underserved so those

184
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:31,640
of you with boards I'm going to recommend you put up just for use and just take a moment

185
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:38,040
to think about as you are thinking about for example Vivian framing your idea what about

186
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:42,880
it is unworkable unavoidable and underserved and urgent and I'm going to take you through

187
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:46,400
each of these I just wanted you to capture the four use on your board so Selene if you

188
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:49,360
do this I'm sorry stellar if you do the same for Selene health just put them up on the

189
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:53,320
board for the moment just want to get us used to kind of creating the basis for we can go

190
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:56,560
through and you're all going to build out your value propositions on your board so just

191
00:11:56,560 --> 00:12:05,480
to be clear so the only person I didn't meet is Sharon hi welcome good to have you here

192
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:13,200
I know you're building a new kind of bike seat can you just tell us what it's about

193
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:19,760
yeah I do not yet have a name hence just the word bike seat but I'm specifically looking

194
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:24,280
at solving the problem of some of the long term health issues that are caused through

195
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:29,000
for women through biking and I'm doing that through looking at how to design a bike seat

196
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:34,480
that reduces pressure and friction that's perfect I don't even need to go any further

197
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:41,000
so I'm going to just ask you to put up these four use and tell me why in your own words

198
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:46,680
for the moment just one example of something that you think is either unworkable unavoidable

199
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:50,120
or urgent or underserved you don't need to tell me right away but I'm going to take you

200
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:54,000
these frameworks and I'll come back to you so I'm giving you a heads up that I'll come

201
00:12:54,000 --> 00:13:00,040
back to you and ask you great now that you've got these let me take you through them so

202
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:06,200
unworkable is sort of obvious but it's really interesting some people think they've got

203
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:10,720
an unworkable problem but the real definition of something that's unworkable is that it

204
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:16,160
is going to cause a problem that when this happens the consequences are so great that

205
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:21,200
somebody could get fired for it so let me give you an example because it's a very interesting

206
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:27,160
one and you might have all lived through it so when the iPhone first got introduced people

207
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:32,520
were lining up to buy them that was the great news the bad news was when they got them they

208
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:37,000
couldn't get them activated and worse still when they did get them activated all the iCloud

209
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:40,280
services to do things like download their contacts and their calendars weren't working

210
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:47,600
either so that problem was so bad so unworkable a lot of people got fired in fact Steve Jobs

211
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:53,020
was quite famously on a tirade about it and it was a problem that was created by a brand

212
00:13:53,020 --> 00:13:58,860
new technology in a mass market and with a lot of people that obviously were very unhappy

213
00:13:58,860 --> 00:14:03,300
about it and today guess what when you buy an iPhone it's pre provisioned you already

214
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:07,980
have all of that worked out and that took years actually to figure out I happen to be

215
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:11,500
one of the investors in a company that solved that problem for carriers on the other side

216
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:17,180
of this like AT&T was worth tens of millions of dollars just fixing that workflow and making

217
00:14:17,180 --> 00:14:20,860
it possible for you to just pick up an iPhone and turn it on and effectively get your new

218
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:25,860
number working so these unworkable problems do get people fired they're that painful and

219
00:14:25,860 --> 00:14:30,700
they cause all sorts of things now ideally they're much more interesting than that so

220
00:14:30,700 --> 00:14:34,580
for example we've got social problems where you've got things that are causing people

221
00:14:34,580 --> 00:14:40,980
to get sick or for example not able to get education or like Connected not able to get

222
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:46,940
that right resources that will help them in a desperate situation then that also is unworkable

223
00:14:46,940 --> 00:14:48,540
you will have your own way of saying it.

224
00:14:48,540 --> 00:14:52,700
Gulnaz would you say what you think is unworkable about Connected?

225
00:14:52,700 --> 00:15:01,500
If I understand it correctly if so if we teach digital literacy skills that kids cannot use

226
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:06,540
yeah that's useless kind of well no let's put it the other way around what happens if

227
00:15:06,540 --> 00:15:11,540
you don't solve the problem if we don't solve the problem so we are trying to close the

228
00:15:11,540 --> 00:15:21,460
socio-economic gap in Kazakhstan that is also caused by educational inequality okay but

229
00:15:21,460 --> 00:15:27,020
what if what happens in Kazakhstan if we don't solve the socio-economic gap what happens

230
00:15:27,020 --> 00:15:35,420
to Kazakhstan yeah I mean the one example is like people protest this year and there

231
00:15:35,420 --> 00:15:44,260
was like a huge wave of unhappy people great so I mean this it's it's important and I

232
00:15:44,260 --> 00:15:48,140
want to make sure that we give gave you airtime for this not every problem that comes through

233
00:15:48,140 --> 00:15:52,820
the iLab is a problem that's technology like the iPhone's not you know getting to to work

234
00:15:52,820 --> 00:15:56,900
it can be a social problem like this is a really big challenge for a nation that's trying

235
00:15:56,900 --> 00:16:02,060
to develop its people that they can't get the education the resources they need it causes

236
00:16:02,060 --> 00:16:07,100
huge unrest great unhappiness and guess what that population is not going to get out of

237
00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:11,420
their third world status unless they get the education they need this is a really unworkable

238
00:16:11,420 --> 00:16:16,260
problem this is one of the biggest problems of our time is that we have huge social divide

239
00:16:16,260 --> 00:16:19,860
so thank you for addressing it and thanks for taking that mission up that's an example

240
00:16:19,860 --> 00:16:25,620
of an unworkable problem anybody got any questions or an idea of where their particular thing

241
00:16:25,620 --> 00:16:30,460
is unworkable today so I don't know whether let's see who have I not talked to you so

242
00:16:30,460 --> 00:16:39,380
far cohort is there anything about what you're doing that's unworkable we're looking largely

243
00:16:39,380 --> 00:16:46,660
at the improving the graduation rates for black students yeah right what happens if we don't

244
00:16:46,660 --> 00:16:54,540
do that if we don't do this 20% of students won't graduate from high school okay so yeah

245
00:16:54,540 --> 00:16:59,220
I don't even need to say any more than that that's a big problem 20% of students have you

246
00:16:59,220 --> 00:17:06,260
got the data on that already can you show that show that to people yes is public data

247
00:17:06,260 --> 00:17:10,180
right yeah so you're in a great place because you're already starting the problem that's

248
00:17:10,180 --> 00:17:14,460
unworkable you can give data behind it and there are real consequences for that which

249
00:17:14,460 --> 00:17:18,740
is again inequality in our society through not being able to educate people interesting

250
00:17:18,740 --> 00:17:22,940
enough you guys should be talking about how do you connect that and yourselves about how

251
00:17:22,940 --> 00:17:26,420
do you make sure that your value prop comes to life in that way but thank you for sharing

252
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:35,300
that anybody got any yeah go ahead sure Facebook for instance what unworkable problem did they

253
00:17:35,300 --> 00:17:42,980
solve so the good news about this is you asked what will open up a whole thread here as B

254
00:17:42,980 --> 00:17:50,020
to B versus B to C and Facebook is obviously very much a B to C company and they're very

255
00:17:50,020 --> 00:17:54,020
different sets of problems when you start talking about B to C generally speaking they're

256
00:17:54,020 --> 00:17:57,860
not about unworkable or unavoidable they're much more about what we'll talk about which

257
00:17:57,860 --> 00:18:01,940
is latent problems that are aspirational and that ultimately become blatant and critical

258
00:18:01,940 --> 00:18:07,260
so we're going to get there but don't don't worry it's coming up any other questions on

259
00:18:07,260 --> 00:18:13,540
unworkable first yeah go ahead how do you know that you're not actually hypothesizing

260
00:18:13,540 --> 00:18:18,580
that this is unworkable because I can give an example but a lot of times what you think

261
00:18:18,620 --> 00:18:23,780
is unworkable could just be something else and I'll go ahead and give an example just

262
00:18:23,780 --> 00:18:29,220
to contextualize that for example oral cancer if you think that oh you may just need to

263
00:18:29,220 --> 00:18:34,420
raise awareness but the problem may not be related to awareness the problem may be related

264
00:18:34,420 --> 00:18:41,100
to access of care there's lack of access so you could say you know what's unworkable is

265
00:18:41,100 --> 00:18:45,420
that there's no awareness and you would be blaming patients but in fact there's just

266
00:18:45,420 --> 00:18:52,580
lack of care access to care so yeah you answered your own question by the way which is great

267
00:18:52,580 --> 00:18:57,180
because you said quite rightly it might be this or it might be that and so what would

268
00:18:57,180 --> 00:19:01,780
you do you'd keep drilling on the the question you asked yourself until you found what is

269
00:19:01,780 --> 00:19:10,540
the root cause of it and so honest answer is many times the reason customers sorry startups

270
00:19:10,540 --> 00:19:14,500
fail is because they don't do what you were doing which is to say well it could be this

271
00:19:14,620 --> 00:19:22,220
it could be that who should you go to to ask the question it's on the board yeah just go

272
00:19:22,220 --> 00:19:27,460
and ask the user okay tell me what the real problem is here tell me what's at the root

273
00:19:27,460 --> 00:19:33,060
of this is it lack of awareness or is it lack of availability or is it my inability to use

274
00:19:33,060 --> 00:19:38,140
the product or the service or whatever it might be that makes sense again the answer

275
00:19:38,140 --> 00:19:42,180
is going to be so obvious when I said 90% of the time it's going to be back to what I said

276
00:19:42,180 --> 00:19:46,940
here which is ask the user get to the customer's viewpoint of this and let them tell you where

277
00:19:46,940 --> 00:19:51,220
their pain is what the problem is and why they're not being able to get the solution to it sounds

278
00:19:51,220 --> 00:19:55,980
so obvious but the more you do that the better better off your value proposition is to get

279
00:19:55,980 --> 00:20:03,500
defined all right so next you unavoidable the good news is that everybody in this room faces

280
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:13,700
two completely unavoidable things what are they taxes and death absolutely right one

281
00:20:13,700 --> 00:20:21,700
of the joys about our lives is that it it does eventually have to come to an end and so taxes

282
00:20:21,700 --> 00:20:27,940
and death or I put a bit more graciously aging a part of the reality of our lives but guess what

283
00:20:27,940 --> 00:20:33,180
because of that there's a whole lot of money that gets made in both those industries like

284
00:20:33,180 --> 00:20:40,820
the aging and the care that goes around that is a huge industry likewise paying tax is a massive

285
00:20:40,820 --> 00:20:45,060
industry and I'm not just talking about QuickBooks and Turbo tax and all those things that that help

286
00:20:45,060 --> 00:20:51,060
out with that it's actually a whole accounting industry that is spawned as a result of the

287
00:20:51,060 --> 00:20:54,900
fact that we have to pay taxes we have to account for what we spend and we have to do all the

288
00:20:54,900 --> 00:21:00,580
things that relate to that so why like this unavoidable part is there are actually a lot

289
00:21:00,580 --> 00:21:06,340
of things that are not so obvious right up to your point earlier at the at the sort of

290
00:21:06,340 --> 00:21:13,100
outset that seem unavoidable until you start to dig and you think about actually you know what I do

291
00:21:13,100 --> 00:21:16,340
need to get my kids educated because if I don't get them educated they're not going to be able to

292
00:21:16,340 --> 00:21:21,140
pay for themselves and get you know self-sufficient and be able to go and build their own lives etc

293
00:21:21,140 --> 00:21:26,300
and so guess what education is pretty much unavoidable too so you know both of you have good

294
00:21:27,220 --> 00:21:35,020
basis to talk about that it's unavoidable also for almost all societies to address that issue at

295
00:21:35,020 --> 00:21:40,540
some level if they're going to be socially and sorry economically viable and so governments do

296
00:21:40,540 --> 00:21:45,380
care about it so again you can get these things to work for you if you can find the right ways to

297
00:21:45,380 --> 00:21:50,020
address them now one of the other things I always love to do here is give an example that is pretty

298
00:21:50,020 --> 00:22:00,660
obvious but how many of you have had COVID at one point it was pretty unavoidable right so what

299
00:22:00,660 --> 00:22:07,180
did we do we all when got vaccinated well maybe not everybody there was a choice but the point is

300
00:22:07,180 --> 00:22:13,180
some health things are also unavoidable and some challenges like that are unavoidable and they

301
00:22:13,180 --> 00:22:18,180
give rise to all sorts of opportunities some of you are even wearing masks in here totally

302
00:22:18,180 --> 00:22:22,580
appropriate guess what that's a whole business that didn't exist beforehand and don't just think

303
00:22:22,580 --> 00:22:27,540
about the mask think about every piece of the supply chain that builds a mask it's a huge business

304
00:22:27,540 --> 00:22:35,100
that came up now we have testing testing has become a huge business because of COVID etc etc so

305
00:22:35,100 --> 00:22:39,420
you see where I'm going with this it's not necessarily something that you face immediately

306
00:22:39,420 --> 00:22:43,460
and say oh that's unavoidable but when you start to think about all the implications of it then you

307
00:22:43,460 --> 00:22:51,500
realize there's lots of businesses that come out of it okay this one is easy urgent so I do

308
00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:57,420
actually want to get another group involved here so Space Health Midori tell me a little bit about

309
00:22:57,420 --> 00:23:05,460
what your business is or your idea isn't and why it might be urgent okay yeah thank you Space Health

310
00:23:05,460 --> 00:23:12,380
has a goal of providing the commercial space sector with a medical professionals for the future

311
00:23:12,420 --> 00:23:18,900
just what the expect didn't see that this industry is going to blow up and you know people that are

312
00:23:18,900 --> 00:23:27,100
going to space for space tourism are going to need medicine in space very cool now I'm going to

313
00:23:27,100 --> 00:23:31,260
challenge you though is that urgent like does everybody in this room feel like they are going

314
00:23:31,260 --> 00:23:37,180
to need health as one of the first things that they spend money on in space I mean health in

315
00:23:37,180 --> 00:23:44,460
space at least not now okay so and I'm not trying to take your idea down but it's one of the most

316
00:23:44,460 --> 00:23:49,500
important criteria is to think about now let's just challenge that for a second and say but to

317
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:54,220
your point anybody who's going to space so that's the space user the customer if you like who's

318
00:23:54,220 --> 00:23:58,420
came out to space I'm sure they feel like they want to check their health before they go and

319
00:23:58,420 --> 00:24:04,100
they're going to need health and safety when they're up there so I'll eat my words and say if you

320
00:24:04,100 --> 00:24:09,260
can find the right user if you can get in touch with whether it's the space agencies or the people

321
00:24:09,260 --> 00:24:13,180
who are actually you know doing the experimentation up there I'm sure there's a tremendous

322
00:24:13,180 --> 00:24:18,380
opportunity for space health so this is where parts the value prop need to tie together and so

323
00:24:18,380 --> 00:24:23,340
you've got a tremendous opportunity if you can pick that segment that's the for who that really

324
00:24:23,340 --> 00:24:30,980
clearly sees this as urgent and I'm sure they will so thanks for sharing okay so what is a tip

325
00:24:31,020 --> 00:24:37,300
here for all of you is the following urgency is all relative so for those of you are not going to

326
00:24:37,300 --> 00:24:44,500
space you could care less about this right so relatively for you it's not important now let's

327
00:24:44,500 --> 00:24:51,940
take a reality in business which is if you're selling to somebody whether you intend to or not

328
00:24:51,940 --> 00:24:58,540
you're going to compete with something or somebody and that time so lots of you all think you've

329
00:24:58,540 --> 00:25:06,220
got a unique solution but here's the bad news there is finite amount of time money and resource

330
00:25:06,220 --> 00:25:12,980
people and everything else that goes around what you're trying to sell into so you're always going

331
00:25:12,980 --> 00:25:17,860
to have to be something that is at the highest priority if you're going to get people's attention

332
00:25:17,860 --> 00:25:22,940
because guess what they won't spend time with you otherwise so it's no good for example trying

333
00:25:22,940 --> 00:25:28,420
to sell a low-income family a very high-definition television set when they haven't even got the

334
00:25:28,420 --> 00:25:33,900
basics of their food and water running or they aren't educating their family it's just obvious

335
00:25:33,900 --> 00:25:37,860
when I say that well it's the same in truth in business too if you go in to try and pitch

336
00:25:37,860 --> 00:25:44,740
somebody something for example that's a nice to have new extension for example to their existing

337
00:25:44,740 --> 00:25:50,180
workflow system but they haven't got basic security in place and they've just been hacked you're not

338
00:25:50,180 --> 00:25:54,700
going to get any attention so you have to think about what their priorities are now what's the best

339
00:25:54,700 --> 00:26:02,740
way to find this out ask back to the same old question now I'll give you a little clue here

340
00:26:02,740 --> 00:26:08,780
what you want to do here is say rather than even introduce what you do whenever you talk to your

341
00:26:08,780 --> 00:26:14,980
potential user or customer ask them what their number one priority is right now don't ask them

342
00:26:14,980 --> 00:26:20,180
about or don't tell them anything about you just say what's your number one priority if you get up

343
00:26:20,180 --> 00:26:25,980
in the morning tomorrow what's the number one thing you need to focus on and why and then if they

344
00:26:25,980 --> 00:26:31,700
tell you say when do you think you're going to get to number two and then let them tell you

345
00:26:31,700 --> 00:26:35,700
number two oftentimes they won't even get to number two what you'll find out is that there's

346
00:26:35,700 --> 00:26:40,060
some pain point that they really have that's really so compelling that's what they're focused on

347
00:26:40,060 --> 00:26:45,260
and obviously if you can address that you're in a good spot if you can't expect to get delayed

348
00:26:45,300 --> 00:26:51,940
and to get deep prioritized and to be spending time waiting to get engaged on your value problem

349
00:26:51,940 --> 00:26:57,300
so that's why urgent is so important now let me give you another startup secret which is pretty

350
00:26:57,300 --> 00:27:03,660
obvious which is that sometimes certain shifts in the market create urgency so a good example right

351
00:27:03,660 --> 00:27:10,340
now is how many of you have mobile phones duh all of you right but if I'd asked that question 20

352
00:27:10,380 --> 00:27:17,260
years ago it would be none of you that shift has been totally dramatic so what has it done to

353
00:27:17,260 --> 00:27:24,980
every industry it's created urgency for people to respond to it when you bank today using your phone

354
00:27:24,980 --> 00:27:30,220
pretty obvious you don't need to go to a bank for most of the things because you can do it all on

355
00:27:30,220 --> 00:27:36,900
your phone again 20 years ago that wasn't the case and so banks had a very very urgent response

356
00:27:36,980 --> 00:27:41,620
that they had to come up with to be able to make it possible for all the users that now said I don't

357
00:27:41,620 --> 00:27:45,780
want to go to a bank and deal with a teller I just want to do it on my phone and the first

358
00:27:45,780 --> 00:27:49,820
banks that moved there were actually not the existing incumbents there were a lot of new

359
00:27:49,820 --> 00:27:54,940
banks that got started as a result of that trend so you want to look for shifts that create urgency

360
00:27:54,940 --> 00:27:59,460
things like mobile I'll tell you there's another major one that's going on right now which is AI

361
00:27:59,460 --> 00:28:04,820
AI is going to be involved in everything and so everybody's scrambling to figure out well how

362
00:28:04,820 --> 00:28:10,020
do I engage AI to make my process more effective more efficient and save time and money for people

363
00:28:10,020 --> 00:28:15,940
so urgency can be something that you also ride based on shifts in the marketplaces so I'm gonna

364
00:28:15,940 --> 00:28:22,540
ask because I don't know anything about it what is CRSP design essentially we make low-cost so

365
00:28:22,540 --> 00:28:30,660
affordable robotics toys for children starting out in South Africa and to use the framework that

366
00:28:30,660 --> 00:28:37,540
we've got up here why is that urgent so when the idea originally started was a personal problem I

367
00:28:37,540 --> 00:28:43,380
had 20 years ago when I was a child and I wanted to get into the space but growing up in a low-income

368
00:28:43,380 --> 00:28:52,340
family nothing was affordable enough to be able to like for me to access it and then now if you

369
00:28:52,340 --> 00:28:59,540
fast forward to like 2010 2015 the world was moving towards the 4IR fourth industrial revolution

370
00:29:00,020 --> 00:29:08,420
and specifically for Africa we were lagging behind so this was an urgent like issue for me personally

371
00:29:08,420 --> 00:29:13,060
being an engineer at the time realizing that our schooling systems weren't actually solving for this

372
00:29:13,700 --> 00:29:20,500
and I think we also went forward to creating a sense of urgency by helping the government create a

373
00:29:20,500 --> 00:29:27,460
curriculum for this so what this eventually did is now schools have started scrambling looking for

374
00:29:27,460 --> 00:29:34,660
resources exactly like this so there are times when as the startup you can actually identify the

375
00:29:34,660 --> 00:29:41,540
problem before the users even I don't know know they have it and then push forward policy or whatever

376
00:29:41,540 --> 00:29:46,820
that then creates a new market then the issue becomes how do you capture value okay so we will

377
00:29:46,820 --> 00:29:52,500
I'll hold that thought because I call that a latent need to a framework that comes up later

378
00:29:52,500 --> 00:29:56,420
and it's interesting the way you described it too but I would say that's you're going to be challenged

379
00:29:56,500 --> 00:30:01,300
with exactly the thing that I'm describing which is how do you get people to say this is more

380
00:30:01,300 --> 00:30:07,140
important than 10 other things that we could be spending our resources on do you agree yeah so

381
00:30:07,140 --> 00:30:13,700
that's why the urgent is pieces so important all right last you is underserved and this one is pretty

382
00:30:13,700 --> 00:30:18,900
obvious I already gave it away there's only finite time money and resources for you to be able to

383
00:30:18,900 --> 00:30:24,340
engage on things and so you have to help people understand why they should prioritize you but

384
00:30:24,340 --> 00:30:29,620
the underserved piece is an interesting thing particularly in B2C marketplaces so anybody

385
00:30:29,620 --> 00:30:35,460
got a B2C value proposition in here they're selling to consumers yeah of course you do taste of Kenya

386
00:30:36,020 --> 00:30:42,180
so tell me about what do you think's underserved in the market for well it's a coffee market right

387
00:30:42,180 --> 00:30:47,380
essentially yeah so at the moment Kenyan coffee consumers can't afford the Kenyan products in

388
00:30:47,380 --> 00:30:52,820
the market so they buy instant coffee which is from Brazil so none of Kenyan coffee consumers

389
00:30:53,300 --> 00:30:58,020
income can afford the coffee that's being sold in the market so you actually the beauty of your

390
00:30:58,020 --> 00:31:02,500
solution is not only is it underserved in that people can't get the coffee from their own local

391
00:31:02,500 --> 00:31:09,780
market but it's also too expensive so you've got two problems that you're addressing you know both

392
00:31:09,780 --> 00:31:14,260
the pain it's unworkable for people who can't afford it and it's underserved in the sense that

393
00:31:14,260 --> 00:31:19,060
literally there's no supply for it at the moment which is great thank you Zipporah so now that

394
00:31:19,060 --> 00:31:24,420
you've all heard the four use I want you to just take a moment in your group and put down the four

395
00:31:24,420 --> 00:31:29,620
use and take a moment for example on Taste of Kenya and put what one criteria is that you think

396
00:31:29,620 --> 00:31:34,740
we just gave you two makes your product unworkable unavoidable urgent and underserved let's take a

397
00:31:34,740 --> 00:31:41,540
few minutes on that in each group almost everybody's come up with some four use if not all of the four

398
00:31:41,540 --> 00:31:47,140
use line I only have to look around the boards to see that so I'm going to just take one or two

399
00:31:47,140 --> 00:31:52,260
boards and just ask for the rest of you to volunteer so first of all I was lucky enough

400
00:31:52,260 --> 00:32:00,820
to listen to Celine health and Stella and Scarlett are serving a a market for women who obviously

401
00:32:00,820 --> 00:32:05,380
have an unavoidable problem Stella and Scarlett do you want to just talk about that sure so

402
00:32:05,380 --> 00:32:12,740
Celine house going to personalize manual puzzle management for mid-aged women or whoever enters

403
00:32:12,740 --> 00:32:18,980
menopause even though they enter it early so the unworkable part is that when the climatic

404
00:32:18,980 --> 00:32:26,660
symptom hits like hot flush night sweats and it hits it just really decrease their functionality

405
00:32:27,220 --> 00:32:33,780
like among this woman so they cannot work so our solution can help them work that's perfect and

406
00:32:33,780 --> 00:32:39,780
unavoidable it menopause is just unavoidable every like half of this room is going to enter

407
00:32:39,940 --> 00:32:44,260
vulnerable we were talking about earlier aging it's just a reality for women yep urgent

408
00:32:45,460 --> 00:32:50,980
just when the symptom hits when you are not feeling comfortable it is urgent that you

409
00:32:50,980 --> 00:32:55,220
it's just like you get a flu and you need to take medicine or you need to do something you

410
00:32:55,220 --> 00:33:02,420
stop going to work so that is an urgent problem you need to fix right and underserved so currently

411
00:33:02,420 --> 00:33:09,540
if you search online to find articles or research dedicated to pregnancy this age

412
00:33:09,540 --> 00:33:16,980
you have so many million billions of research results coming out but for menopausal age

413
00:33:16,980 --> 00:33:25,060
this population you find barely like a hundred like one in a hundred of them yeah that little

414
00:33:25,060 --> 00:33:31,060
so only two percent of the research funding are devoted to this population so this population

415
00:33:31,060 --> 00:33:38,660
is underserved thank you very much so I had no idea about any of that although without revealing

416
00:33:38,660 --> 00:33:43,300
who it is in my family I have somebody in my family who would say this is really a critical issue

417
00:33:44,180 --> 00:33:49,300
and it does cause her to be literally unable to function at certain period of time and there's

418
00:33:49,300 --> 00:33:54,020
way too little information about it and way too few solutions around it and many women go through

419
00:33:54,020 --> 00:33:58,020
this so all those four yous felt very real to me as I was listening to that and I see a lot of

420
00:33:58,020 --> 00:34:02,020
women in here who are nodding their heads around it so congratulations on finding such a great

421
00:34:02,020 --> 00:34:07,860
four you problem all right just because of time I don't want to go around and do every board there's

422
00:34:07,860 --> 00:34:12,260
too many boards here but I would love to give anybody a chance you had an to say who had an aha

423
00:34:12,260 --> 00:34:17,140
moment I know you guys did for example but I want you to volunteer anybody have an aha moment when

424
00:34:17,140 --> 00:34:24,900
they were going through their four yous and care to share yep go ahead so Hannah just left but

425
00:34:26,020 --> 00:34:32,340
interestingly enough we started off with a bit of a debate and it turns out with some ideas and

426
00:34:32,340 --> 00:34:37,540
I think with our one it could maybe be solved by just having a new policy in place not even

427
00:34:37,540 --> 00:34:44,020
having a business or a startup you know so in those cases I don't know what that means in terms of

428
00:34:44,020 --> 00:34:51,460
the problem you're solving is it one if it's too social focused that you actually can't solve it

429
00:34:51,460 --> 00:34:55,700
as a business and you're better off joining government in lobbying internally well that's a

430
00:34:55,700 --> 00:35:01,460
big aha by the way so one of the things that I always want to say when I mentor at the iLab is

431
00:35:02,020 --> 00:35:05,620
don't be afraid to recognize what you're trying to do is not a good thing to do

432
00:35:06,580 --> 00:35:10,020
uh really seriously because you you know this is your life so you don't want to spend it on

433
00:35:10,020 --> 00:35:15,220
something that's not a real problem that you can solve as a startup and so what you just identified

434
00:35:15,220 --> 00:35:19,540
I think is a great example of that you might realize that actually this is a problem that needs to be

435
00:35:19,540 --> 00:35:24,100
solved in government first with policy so I actually want to give you a round of applause for being

436
00:35:24,100 --> 00:35:29,300
that honest about it I think that's huge that was a big aha anybody else want to share an aha we'll

437
00:35:29,300 --> 00:35:39,460
do one more yeah go ahead Dan for Terraflow um it's a it's a software that helps pharmaceutical

438
00:35:39,460 --> 00:35:44,980
companies understand why the same drug works in some patients but not in others so normally when

439
00:35:44,980 --> 00:35:48,740
I talk about Terraflow I talk about like cancer and the need to get the right drugs to the right

440
00:35:48,740 --> 00:35:54,020
patients but I think really the the problem we're trying to solve is that usually our client is a

441
00:35:54,020 --> 00:36:00,820
scientist that has kind of stuck their head out by convincing the pharma to fund this expensive

442
00:36:00,820 --> 00:36:07,300
clinical trial and they have an unavoidable problem because they have to prove to their vice president

443
00:36:07,300 --> 00:36:12,980
that this experiment was worth it and what our software does is basically provide a very clear

444
00:36:12,980 --> 00:36:17,540
interpretable report that shows to other stakeholders that what they're doing is important

445
00:36:17,540 --> 00:36:21,140
and if they didn't how much money would they lose potentially

446
00:36:21,460 --> 00:36:29,700
um well if if the drug fails to go to market because they didn't discover the right biomarkers

447
00:36:29,700 --> 00:36:34,340
it would be billions there you go so this is what we want to try to do and thank you Dan that was a

448
00:36:34,340 --> 00:36:39,460
brilliant example is we want to try to identify the problem in a way that your user or your buyer

449
00:36:39,460 --> 00:36:43,220
is going to say well of course I need to do this if I don't do this I'm going to lose billions my

450
00:36:43,220 --> 00:36:47,620
drug may not get to market because I can't even identify the right biomarkers now you're going

451
00:36:47,620 --> 00:36:51,300
to get people's attention now you're going to build something that is compelling that causes

452
00:36:51,300 --> 00:36:56,500
people to act and want to buy that's why these four users are so important great example all right

453
00:36:57,460 --> 00:37:02,900
next framework is a fun one it's actually one of my favorites because it addresses this question

454
00:37:02,900 --> 00:37:07,940
that came up with b to c so I think it was you Vivian who asked about facebook so how many of

455
00:37:07,940 --> 00:37:14,900
you use facebook or any of its derivatives like instagram or whatsapp good pretty much everybody

456
00:37:15,620 --> 00:37:22,900
now if I was to say to you why I would argue that every one of you has what some people call

457
00:37:22,900 --> 00:37:28,260
maslow's hierarchy of needs or some other you know form of it social needs security needs

458
00:37:28,820 --> 00:37:35,540
physical needs emotional needs you know economic needs etc these are all needs we have and basically

459
00:37:35,540 --> 00:37:41,620
if we don't have them met we end up in a bad place so what is it that facebook addresses for us

460
00:37:42,340 --> 00:37:50,420
what need is it connection people it's a huge need do you know what the number one cause of

461
00:37:50,420 --> 00:37:58,660
unhappiness in the world is loneliness the number one finding of the longest study at harvard ever

462
00:37:58,660 --> 00:38:07,700
since 1938 of happiness is one thing connection when people have social connection they are happier

463
00:38:07,700 --> 00:38:13,140
so this is a very big need that's what facebook addresses and by the way social networks in

464
00:38:13,140 --> 00:38:17,540
general address now there's lots of other things to do I always joke about it on the other side

465
00:38:17,540 --> 00:38:23,460
which is you know guess what we all want to meet people and date and eventually you know find

466
00:38:23,460 --> 00:38:28,100
somebody to partner with and get married have kids whatever it is not all but generally speaking

467
00:38:28,100 --> 00:38:34,500
that's a huge need so that's why things like bumble took off or at the other extreme why facebook in

468
00:38:34,500 --> 00:38:38,580
the first place took off because people just wanted to connect to get together on on different

469
00:38:38,580 --> 00:38:44,980
things that they had similar interests around huge huge things build from that so anyway b to c if

470
00:38:44,980 --> 00:38:50,100
that makes sense different approach different framework but some similar principle at some

471
00:38:50,100 --> 00:38:55,460
point it becomes unworkable for people for example that are in you know foreign nations to stay in

472
00:38:55,460 --> 00:39:00,820
touch with their families back home without a social network whatsapp took off for that very

473
00:39:00,820 --> 00:39:06,980
reason way too expensive to pick up the phone and call home tremendously cheap to do it on whatsapp

474
00:39:06,980 --> 00:39:13,780
for free basically that's why it took off that was actually a critical need for people there are

475
00:39:13,780 --> 00:39:18,900
whole industries that are built on that for example financial services in the third world is still

476
00:39:18,900 --> 00:39:23,540
incredibly expensive to do things like do basic payments and send money around the place but

477
00:39:23,540 --> 00:39:30,180
on social networks weibo and and tencent in china for example that was enabling of that and solving

478
00:39:30,180 --> 00:39:36,420
of that problem all right so i have an example here that brings it all together and hopefully

479
00:39:36,420 --> 00:39:40,580
it will be a useful one for you to see because it's sort of b to b and it's sort of b to c

480
00:39:40,580 --> 00:39:45,940
does anybody use rent the runway there's a Harvard startup so yeah a couple of you have

481
00:39:46,660 --> 00:39:51,060
okay uh just because you've talked vivian let me ask this young lady at the back

482
00:39:51,060 --> 00:39:57,940
why do you use rent the runway i used it once like 10 years ago because i was going to um

483
00:39:58,900 --> 00:40:05,460
i forget what event in dc and it was easy and i knew i would never need to wear that

484
00:40:06,100 --> 00:40:10,340
like whatever i wore i knew i would take a lot of pictures in and not want to wear it again

485
00:40:10,340 --> 00:40:14,900
okay great so few at the moment it was urgent in that moment you had to go to this event vivian

486
00:40:14,900 --> 00:40:22,020
why did you use it same i am a foreigner i have basic clothes with me in the states only and as i

487
00:40:22,100 --> 00:40:28,740
can see as you can see and i was invited for like a nice event and i couldn't show up in my ex-boyfriend

488
00:40:28,740 --> 00:40:35,380
hoodie actually i think you should have done it would have been a real winner uh but that's

489
00:40:35,380 --> 00:40:40,980
a whole other story so this is a fun story and for those of you don't his name is nicole

490
00:40:45,940 --> 00:40:49,860
that particular garment should go on rent the runway that would make a lot of money

491
00:40:50,580 --> 00:40:55,300
all right so the thing is this is a good example of saying that sort of crosses between b2b and b2c

492
00:40:55,300 --> 00:41:01,060
in lots of different regards so um rent the runway in many ways is unworkable is an unworkable

493
00:41:01,060 --> 00:41:06,020
problem for people who can't afford to go and find a dress or a or an outfit or something for a

494
00:41:06,020 --> 00:41:10,420
particular occasion which they're going to go to sometimes it's a basic thing like a graduation party

495
00:41:11,140 --> 00:41:16,180
and they want to show up it's also underserved in the sense that people can't afford to get

496
00:41:16,180 --> 00:41:21,140
access to those things let alone uh you know do it for one particular thing and it's really

497
00:41:21,140 --> 00:41:25,860
interesting by the way it's unavoidable for certain people who feel like they've got to show up

498
00:41:25,860 --> 00:41:29,300
not in their boyfriend's hoodie but actually looking smart for their parents for example when

499
00:41:29,300 --> 00:41:35,380
they're going to an event uh there's so many reasons why this is something that just was underserved

500
00:41:35,380 --> 00:41:40,020
as a result because the only alternative solution to it was going and spending a lot of money

501
00:41:40,020 --> 00:41:45,300
on a one-off basis that just made it completely unworkable so anyway lots of views about rent

502
00:41:45,300 --> 00:41:49,300
the runway and one of the things that's interesting about it by the way is it's really struggled as

503
00:41:49,300 --> 00:41:54,180
a business despite that and that's because its business model is tough and that's why we did

504
00:41:54,180 --> 00:42:00,420
the session last time so working with a great value prop is not the only part of a business

505
00:42:00,420 --> 00:42:04,820
that's important it's one part of it if you can't make it economically viable which is what we talked

506
00:42:04,820 --> 00:42:09,540
about last session it's still not going to be sustainable so that's how to think about these

507
00:42:09,540 --> 00:42:13,940
two workshops that we just did last time and this time together the second thing I promised to do

508
00:42:13,940 --> 00:42:20,900
was to talk a little bit about the latent need that you brought up so there are oftentimes needs

509
00:42:20,900 --> 00:42:27,300
that start out as latent meaning people don't think about them day to day they're not like at the

510
00:42:27,300 --> 00:42:33,620
top of their mind and aspirational we just gave you an example which is a latent need is to look good

511
00:42:33,620 --> 00:42:38,580
you don't necessarily think of it every day but you do want to get up and feel good and it's

512
00:42:38,660 --> 00:42:44,340
aspirational also in the sense that when you're looking good and feeling good guess what you can

513
00:42:44,340 --> 00:42:48,660
probably feel like more confident to do your job or your work or you know play your sport or whatever

514
00:42:48,660 --> 00:42:56,420
else it is but certain needs evolve to becoming really critical and blatantly so so let's take

515
00:42:56,420 --> 00:43:05,220
an example how many of you have an ipad do you think that's blatantly critical or is it latent

516
00:43:05,220 --> 00:43:14,900
and aspirational critical tell me more tell me more yeah okay so it's turned into your main thing

517
00:43:14,900 --> 00:43:20,180
that you take notes and everything else right okay good so there are people by the way who have the

518
00:43:20,180 --> 00:43:25,700
other extreme anybody here feel like they're on the I just use it when I need to to watch a movie

519
00:43:25,700 --> 00:43:33,060
or whatever Tata interestingly enough I had an ipad for a long time then I wasn't using it that much

520
00:43:33,060 --> 00:43:38,420
I got to Harvard and then I was like oh snap I need a new one because everyone is using it then I

521
00:43:38,420 --> 00:43:43,940
got into HBS classes and they're like no technology allowed so I sent back the one I just bought

522
00:43:44,580 --> 00:43:49,380
so it went from like it wasn't critical then it was critical then I didn't need it anymore

523
00:43:50,180 --> 00:43:55,140
well let me let me tell you why I use the ipad as an example because there's a vast array of people

524
00:43:55,140 --> 00:43:59,860
use them for a lot of different things and some people would say yeah it's kind of nice and other

525
00:43:59,860 --> 00:44:04,980
people would say no I got to have it and when it was first announced people joked about the name

526
00:44:04,980 --> 00:44:10,420
and they said oh it's just a big iPhone why would I want one of those and it really didn't take off

527
00:44:10,420 --> 00:44:15,700
for a long time until people started building applications for it and they became really critical

528
00:44:15,700 --> 00:44:21,380
for certain people so for example if you're a pilot today you might use this for navigation and trust

529
00:44:21,380 --> 00:44:26,180
me it's critical it's not like you're not going to take it with you this is what you use to make

530
00:44:26,180 --> 00:44:30,900
sure you're going to get home so it depends on the application it's also true in medicine for

531
00:44:30,900 --> 00:44:34,020
example that has become critical in certain situations where it's too difficult to use a

532
00:44:34,020 --> 00:44:39,140
keyboard and people just need to write and they just want to for example touch something to actually

533
00:44:39,140 --> 00:44:45,780
activate a particular function in an operating room so it depends on the application so what I try

534
00:44:45,780 --> 00:44:50,740
to say about this framework is as follows try to understand your use case is it something people

535
00:44:50,740 --> 00:44:55,860
think is just nice to have or is it really critical and if you can identify the difference

536
00:44:55,940 --> 00:45:00,900
between something that's nice to have and must have guess which one you want to be in

537
00:45:01,700 --> 00:45:09,620
duh you want to be in the top right there but again ask your user find out what they're doing

538
00:45:09,620 --> 00:45:15,300
with it if the iPad had never made its way into medicine or you know flight navigation or those

539
00:45:15,300 --> 00:45:18,420
other critical applications probably wouldn't have taken off but it's made its way into a lot of

540
00:45:18,420 --> 00:45:24,180
those things and then for some users in the B2C class they critically consider their entertainment

541
00:45:24,180 --> 00:45:28,260
to be like I gotta have entertainment this is a super important thing to me I don't need a

542
00:45:28,260 --> 00:45:32,820
television I'll just have an iPad and there are people who've gone to YouTube as their basis for

543
00:45:32,820 --> 00:45:38,500
educate I mean for entertainment so that's their interface for it anyway fun fun thing for you to

544
00:45:38,500 --> 00:45:43,140
play with I encourage you to put your diagram out there and when you talk to users map where

545
00:45:43,140 --> 00:45:48,740
they're telling you they are ask them how critical this is what else is a priority instead what else

546
00:45:48,740 --> 00:45:52,660
would they do to what they spend their money on if it's not on what you're offering them

547
00:45:53,620 --> 00:45:59,860
any questions on that before I move on yeah Victor just follow me up on that when they built the

548
00:45:59,860 --> 00:46:05,460
iPad they didn't know they are going to need to build that many applications on it right yeah so

549
00:46:06,740 --> 00:46:11,540
they didn't really solve a critical problem at the time of building the the application so how

550
00:46:11,540 --> 00:46:18,180
would you think about if you have the chicken egg first or the egg first so let's take a moment to

551
00:46:18,180 --> 00:46:21,700
answer Victor's question because it's a very important one which is you know the chicken and egg

552
00:46:21,700 --> 00:46:29,620
question comes up a lot so you've got an idea and you think there's some opportunity out here in

553
00:46:29,620 --> 00:46:34,180
the market I realize I've just drawn the same diagram I've drawn above but anyway it's starting

554
00:46:34,180 --> 00:46:41,220
afresh the answer is that one of the most amazing things about Steve Jobs is he was somebody that

555
00:46:41,220 --> 00:46:45,860
people said never talked to users he's famous for it he's like it was his idea to come up with the

556
00:46:45,860 --> 00:46:52,180
iPad but what he was brilliant at was identifying it great vision for what this thing could be

557
00:46:53,460 --> 00:46:59,300
and then he built the important piece which is a whole business opportunity for many markets

558
00:46:59,300 --> 00:47:06,660
which is a platform that said anybody in here can take my device here use my platform and build

559
00:47:06,660 --> 00:47:13,860
the application they particularly need and so guess what hundreds then thousands then tens

560
00:47:13,860 --> 00:47:18,980
of thousands now millions of applications have been built for that platform and this is a business

561
00:47:18,980 --> 00:47:25,380
model that is really fascinating and whole study in of itself that we could get into it's a very

562
00:47:25,380 --> 00:47:30,420
viable way to build products what it really says is as follows you've got to make this platform

563
00:47:30,420 --> 00:47:36,420
easy enough for your idea to be adopted by the users and to solve their own problem for example

564
00:47:36,980 --> 00:47:41,780
you remember in the last session I told you that open source works this way it says that anybody

565
00:47:41,780 --> 00:47:47,220
can take the code that you offer for example to create and I mentioned websites and Acquire and

566
00:47:47,220 --> 00:47:52,580
Drupal the idea of a website and extend it any way they want to make their website capable of

567
00:47:52,580 --> 00:47:58,020
integrating Instagram at one extreme and at the other extreme Salesforce to be able to do things

568
00:47:58,020 --> 00:48:03,540
like give people a great experience when they go to the Grammys and take photographs and upload

569
00:48:03,540 --> 00:48:07,300
them to the site and at the other extreme have a close relationship with all those customers so

570
00:48:07,300 --> 00:48:10,340
they can keep selling them other things like records and merchandise and everything else

571
00:48:11,060 --> 00:48:15,860
that is a whole industry now experience management and it was built on a platform

572
00:48:15,860 --> 00:48:20,980
an open source platform just like the iPad was an open platform for people to develop applications

573
00:48:22,180 --> 00:48:28,660
well a counter example would be pebble right they came up with spot collection and now they're gone

574
00:48:28,660 --> 00:48:30,900
so great so what was wrong with pebble

575
00:48:34,580 --> 00:48:38,980
anybody know this this particular product well you do so what what do you think was wrong with it

576
00:48:40,820 --> 00:48:46,500
I don't know I think it fits the framework like it answers all the views and black and white question

577
00:48:46,500 --> 00:48:57,220
but then really was it urgent it's as urgent as an Apple watch what was it open I think it runs

578
00:48:57,220 --> 00:49:02,420
Android so various things that I I don't want to get drawn into this too much but I will tell you

579
00:49:02,420 --> 00:49:07,780
I wrote an article you can find it on LinkedIn when I bought my first Apple watch I offered it

580
00:49:07,780 --> 00:49:11,780
to anybody who wanted to tell me why there was a reason to keep it because I didn't think there

581
00:49:11,780 --> 00:49:16,900
was a need for it it actually was a useless gadget when it first came out it was like it

582
00:49:16,900 --> 00:49:20,660
didn't even stay on I had to do this to be able to look at the time I mean it was like

583
00:49:20,660 --> 00:49:24,980
and there were no applications for it to speak of so I think it was a bit like the pebble and

584
00:49:25,620 --> 00:49:29,860
what worked was that they had a development platform again and they had a large developer

585
00:49:29,860 --> 00:49:33,780
user base who started create applications now there's no way I would give up my Apple watch

586
00:49:34,740 --> 00:49:38,740
it's now used for some critical things like my health I monitor my sleep with it all

587
00:49:38,740 --> 00:49:42,500
sorts of other things my blood pressure all sorts of things so it's become critical to me and by the

588
00:49:42,500 --> 00:49:47,380
way actually for timekeeping which is a big part of my job that I need to get back on time it is

589
00:49:47,380 --> 00:49:52,180
actually the thing that keeps me on time so with that I'll just simply say let's talk afterwards

590
00:49:52,180 --> 00:49:56,420
because it's a great discussion like a lot of things there aren't answers but there are questions

591
00:49:56,420 --> 00:50:00,500
you could ask in the frameworks that would reveal to you why pebble would be successful and why

592
00:50:00,500 --> 00:50:04,820
apple watch sorry wasn't successful why apple watch was successful some of which by the way is

593
00:50:04,820 --> 00:50:10,660
marketing too all right when you start building your product there are a whole set of things that

594
00:50:10,660 --> 00:50:16,100
are basically dependencies that you want to be aware of and I talk about this in the workbook

595
00:50:16,100 --> 00:50:22,820
because you need to get a couple of concepts clear and they basically are how your product

596
00:50:22,820 --> 00:50:29,860
actually fits into the solution that the customer has and so I will say it and then you can go and

597
00:50:29,860 --> 00:50:37,940
look in the workbook the first concept is that your product is very unlikely to be the whole

598
00:50:37,940 --> 00:50:44,900
solution that a customer has and we started talking about smartphones so I'll just give you an example

599
00:50:45,780 --> 00:50:48,740
why is a smartphone its own not a whole product

600
00:50:51,060 --> 00:50:54,260
what what do you need with a smartphone to make it useful go ahead

601
00:50:54,420 --> 00:50:56,500
apps apps yep what else

602
00:50:58,340 --> 00:51:03,380
yeah absolutely it's absolutely useless into you unless you have a carrier and unless you have

603
00:51:03,380 --> 00:51:08,100
some apps for it although I'd say one of the apps is built in which is the phone but the point is

604
00:51:08,100 --> 00:51:13,540
that almost every product if you look at it has some aspects of it that need to make it a whole

605
00:51:13,540 --> 00:51:17,700
solution for the customer so that's the first concept you'll find in the workbook the second

606
00:51:17,700 --> 00:51:23,060
one is once you realize that you realize well actually you have dependencies on your product

607
00:51:23,060 --> 00:51:27,300
being successful like if there weren't networks and I gave you the example that when the phones

608
00:51:27,300 --> 00:51:31,380
couldn't be provisioned on networks they were just bricks they were useless or if you don't have the

609
00:51:31,380 --> 00:51:36,100
app that solves your particular problem it's also useless to you so what you want to do is figure

610
00:51:36,100 --> 00:51:40,420
out what are those dependencies those external factors that you need to work with in order for

611
00:51:40,420 --> 00:51:46,420
your product to meet the needs end to end the solution if you will and if you don't pay attention

612
00:51:46,420 --> 00:51:50,660
to those again you'll be selling something that can't really solve the problem that you're trying

613
00:51:50,660 --> 00:51:55,140
to address so it's in the workbook you can go look it up there's some examples including apple

614
00:51:55,140 --> 00:52:00,980
pay which is quite a fun one and also Tesla which is another fun one which is still to this day

615
00:52:00,980 --> 00:52:06,580
having a big dependency on charging stations and the availability of electrical you know

616
00:52:06,580 --> 00:52:10,100
access for people to really say oh I'm definitely going to buy a Tesla I know lots of people who

617
00:52:10,100 --> 00:52:14,980
won't because they just know they can't rely on it so debt is an important thing to think about

618
00:52:14,980 --> 00:52:23,540
next up is what we want to make sure happens in a positive way for you which is how do you make

619
00:52:23,540 --> 00:52:31,140
sure you really do cut through the noise so every startup I know will say that they are

620
00:52:31,700 --> 00:52:37,860
some way faster better cheaper you're all nodding your heads and I'm sure that that's

621
00:52:37,860 --> 00:52:42,660
true for a lot of your things so anybody think that they are not faster better or cheaper

622
00:52:42,660 --> 00:52:46,660
is probably not in this room they probably like decided oh I'm really not in the right place

623
00:52:46,660 --> 00:52:51,540
David you're having a good laugh about this so are you working on something that you think is

624
00:52:51,540 --> 00:52:57,540
faster better cheaper tell me more about it we're going to help David get beyond this by the way

625
00:52:58,820 --> 00:53:03,780
so I'm in the the travel space so what I'm doing is I'm developing

626
00:53:04,020 --> 00:53:10,180
an app that would help customers

627
00:53:13,140 --> 00:53:20,180
find outrageously cheap airfares so what we're dealing with

628
00:53:22,100 --> 00:53:28,660
at least you know I mean it could vary but 30 to 90 percent off okay

629
00:53:28,820 --> 00:53:38,580
good I'm going to just hold that for a second is there any other thing about it that's that's

630
00:53:38,580 --> 00:53:43,860
better because you said cheaper basically but is it better because it's faster or it's so

631
00:53:44,420 --> 00:53:52,580
that would probably be the the tech behind it right so the sauce behind it I would call it

632
00:53:54,260 --> 00:53:57,380
but to the customer is there any reason why they say oh this is way better it's a better

633
00:53:57,380 --> 00:54:03,700
experience is it easier than travel velocity or you know pick if I so it it works in a totally

634
00:54:03,700 --> 00:54:12,740
different form so basically the customer tells me where they want to leave from yep but they're

635
00:54:12,740 --> 00:54:18,100
never telling me where they want to go to necessarily interesting so this is this sounds

636
00:54:18,100 --> 00:54:23,380
interesting I'm just going to put it destinationless okay that's definitely different

637
00:54:23,460 --> 00:54:31,620
so by the end of this class I want you to come up and tell me whether we can get rid of

638
00:54:31,620 --> 00:54:36,100
but faster better cheaper and come up with a better framework for you and I'm going to start

639
00:54:36,100 --> 00:54:40,500
talking a little bit about why I think it's a dangerous thing so the reason I hate faster

640
00:54:40,500 --> 00:54:44,340
better cheaper is that there are people out there have more resource than you do as a startup

641
00:54:45,060 --> 00:54:50,340
so if kayak or travel velocity or pick your favorite decided to come after you David they're

642
00:54:50,340 --> 00:54:56,740
going to have more resource to try to put whatever it is the tech behind what they do and so there's

643
00:54:56,740 --> 00:55:01,540
probably something in your secret source that is more than just faster better cheaper maybe it's

644
00:55:01,540 --> 00:55:06,180
something that's defensible maybe it's some IP maybe it's something beyond the tech it's a network

645
00:55:06,180 --> 00:55:09,860
the way you actually connect to people to get the data for your affairs there may be a whole bunch

646
00:55:09,860 --> 00:55:16,420
of things but in the end we want to make sure that you end up there and here's why if you can get

647
00:55:16,500 --> 00:55:22,180
to what we call a 3d breakthrough something that's truly disruptive truly discontinuous

648
00:55:22,180 --> 00:55:28,900
and really defensible then you as a startup have a chance even with small resources in fact it's

649
00:55:28,900 --> 00:55:33,460
the story of why startups succeed is that they make these big breakthroughs they punch through the

650
00:55:33,460 --> 00:55:38,180
noise with something that's just completely disruptive like a business model like google had

651
00:55:38,180 --> 00:55:43,460
to use advertising and selling sell instead of selling software to give away their office suite

652
00:55:43,460 --> 00:55:47,780
where microsoft was having to get you to pay for it it was totally disruptive it caused

653
00:55:47,780 --> 00:55:52,980
microsoft to be a dial tone as a stock for many years that's what we mean by this so let's get

654
00:55:52,980 --> 00:55:58,820
into these 3d's and see if we can identify some for you so first of all disruptive is as I said

655
00:55:58,820 --> 00:56:04,260
sometimes a technology but often a business model like airbnb changed the travel industry

656
00:56:05,780 --> 00:56:10,580
they didn't actually invent anything they don't even own the homes that you go and visit or the

657
00:56:10,580 --> 00:56:16,100
places you go and stay at what they created was a means to connect people and give them experiences

658
00:56:16,100 --> 00:56:22,740
by sharing resources that other people were not using genius right that could have been invented

659
00:56:23,460 --> 00:56:27,460
sitting here tonight and that's one of the things that's so exciting about business models is why

660
00:56:27,460 --> 00:56:33,380
we spent time on it last time but then there are also technologies so I would argue multi touch is

661
00:56:33,380 --> 00:56:38,820
one of these multi touch was such a game changer because the minute you could use that interface

662
00:56:38,820 --> 00:56:43,380
now instead of having to have a dedicated user interface for every single thing you did so remember

663
00:56:43,380 --> 00:56:50,740
that example of in the operating theater imagine if you had all the all the instruments that you

664
00:56:50,740 --> 00:56:56,340
needed to work with on a one single interface that could change during the operation as you were

665
00:56:56,340 --> 00:57:00,900
going through various different stages of it I'm describing a real thing by the way as opposed to

666
00:57:00,900 --> 00:57:05,140
you have to go to every single instrument learn that interface and figure out when you go and find

667
00:57:05,140 --> 00:57:09,300
you know how to use it no it just flows for you and actually it's monitoring the patient at the

668
00:57:09,300 --> 00:57:13,380
real in real time too so you can actually see what you need to spend time on a way you need to focus

669
00:57:14,100 --> 00:57:19,220
that's what multi touch did it can save lives it's that critical it's not just for playing games on

670
00:57:19,220 --> 00:57:26,500
phones but by the way it's a very big industry too so that's what we want to try to have you find

671
00:57:26,500 --> 00:57:33,620
so that's what we mean by disruptive now I'm going to use an example was Amazon a disruption

672
00:57:33,620 --> 00:57:40,580
when it first came out no why not because that's what did the same in the UK was the first in the

673
00:57:40,580 --> 00:57:45,620
united kingdom who did it commerce my best knowledge okay very good anybody else think it was a

674
00:57:45,620 --> 00:57:52,100
not a breakthrough nothing new in the way of products but why is why is the success of Amazon

675
00:57:52,100 --> 00:57:58,900
then been so great and by the way I want to hear why you think it wasn't like a breakthrough too

676
00:57:58,900 --> 00:58:03,140
I'm just as interested somebody over here I think said it wasn't yeah go ahead Dave well I think

677
00:58:03,140 --> 00:58:11,940
Amazon because just of the success in marketing right or just being user friendly you know just

678
00:58:11,940 --> 00:58:16,980
getting to the customer because what I what I'm discovering is a lot of these big companies that

679
00:58:17,540 --> 00:58:24,500
people kind of like in a way idolized they're just older ideas that other people had before

680
00:58:25,460 --> 00:58:30,740
you know that's all it is there's nothing really new but they just happen to blow up

681
00:58:31,940 --> 00:58:36,900
and not everyone know their name okay so they became bigger they had more scale

682
00:58:38,020 --> 00:58:44,980
they became faster they became better and they became cheaper which is why it's really dangerous

683
00:58:44,980 --> 00:58:51,940
to try to compete with them but yet they succeeded so I would argue the reason they succeeded was

684
00:58:52,820 --> 00:58:57,220
and there was in Jeff Brazos's quote you all see this this these trucks driving around

685
00:58:58,100 --> 00:59:03,700
no other business gave you these two things it wasn't do you want low prices or do you want

686
00:59:03,700 --> 00:59:09,300
fast delivery you can have both by the way there was actually a third if you read his quote

687
00:59:09,300 --> 00:59:15,140
is to go backwards which was choice and in fact it was how it was how they first got going

688
00:59:15,140 --> 00:59:20,100
Amazon succeeded as a bookstore to start off with because you couldn't get access to the

689
00:59:20,100 --> 00:59:24,820
long tail of books that people wanted literally physically you couldn't get access you had to

690
00:59:24,820 --> 00:59:29,700
go find those books in bookstores and suddenly they said nope we'll find you any book on the

691
00:59:29,700 --> 00:59:34,420
isban code or wherever it is in the world that you need to get access to so it was it was first

692
00:59:34,420 --> 00:59:39,860
and foremost selection but then when they really focused in it became actually not even selection

693
00:59:39,860 --> 00:59:45,700
but fast prices I mean sorry fast delivery and low prices so it is actually a breakthrough

694
00:59:46,500 --> 00:59:51,620
it's a breakthrough that they managed to do because they built huge scale and they got the

695
00:59:51,620 --> 00:59:56,100
economies of scale to put behind that it's also a fascinating example for another D

696
00:59:56,900 --> 01:00:03,220
so that's the disruption they first had it was discontinuous what came next discontinuous is

697
01:00:03,220 --> 01:00:13,220
something that you couldn't do before this next thing what is that AWS cloud computing was invented

698
01:00:13,220 --> 01:00:18,820
by Amazon and why did they why were they able to invent it because they got such scale in their

699
01:00:18,820 --> 01:00:26,820
operations that their compute resources became accessible at a price that was so marginally

700
01:00:27,620 --> 01:00:32,740
efficient to sell to other people that now people could start using the cloud as it became known

701
01:00:32,740 --> 01:00:37,460
as a basis to build their own business they rented their if you will their hardware infrastructure

702
01:00:37,460 --> 01:00:42,820
their storage and their compute to people who wanted to use it and they had such economies of scale

703
01:00:43,300 --> 01:00:46,660
that it was actually extremely effective for them to do that we're actually leveraging something

704
01:00:46,660 --> 01:00:51,380
that already built the huge data centers etc to do that that story by the way was told right here

705
01:00:51,380 --> 01:00:57,300
in this iLab by the guy who got behind it well actually created it Andy Jassy who's a donor to

706
01:00:57,300 --> 01:01:02,660
this iLab and it's an interesting story to listen to so it's something that started out as a

707
01:01:02,660 --> 01:01:07,380
disruption it became a discontinuous innovation it gave rise to cloud computing anybody here using

708
01:01:07,380 --> 01:01:14,020
the cloud i'm sure terror flow must be yeah almost all of you are huge game changer i mean

709
01:01:14,020 --> 01:01:17,300
and what's interesting about it and this is where i want you to think about discontinuous

710
01:01:17,300 --> 01:01:23,380
things is you couldn't do certain things today without the cloud so pretty much everything we

711
01:01:23,380 --> 01:01:28,420
do on our mobile phones couldn't do without the cloud and anything that you're thinking about

712
01:01:28,420 --> 01:01:36,260
in terms of for example how we solved this problem of working after covid how would we have done that

713
01:01:36,260 --> 01:01:40,660
if we hadn't had the cloud we'd have all disappeared and been unable to communicate and connect and

714
01:01:40,660 --> 01:01:44,820
do zoom and all those other things so these are discontinuous innovations that's what those

715
01:01:44,820 --> 01:01:51,620
things are about and then finally the third D is how does it become defensible so there are lots

716
01:01:51,620 --> 01:01:58,020
of ways things can become defensible here are a few examples you can have great IP that's the

717
01:01:58,020 --> 01:02:03,300
typical one some breakthrough innovation so i'm going to guess here that dan you would say something

718
01:02:03,380 --> 01:02:08,660
about terror flow is going to be protectable as ip am i right okay and are you going to go

719
01:02:08,660 --> 01:02:16,020
after a patent for it perhaps even possibly so if you don't is there some effect that you think

720
01:02:16,020 --> 01:02:21,620
you'll have that will cause customers to get to say that hey we will not take terror flow

721
01:02:22,900 --> 01:02:26,100
out of our business once we've got working it i've got it working with us

722
01:02:27,780 --> 01:02:33,140
will it become part of their end-to-end way that they bring drugs to market for example

723
01:02:33,780 --> 01:02:40,020
okay and once it does will they take it away no because it's the way they're used to interpreting

724
01:02:40,020 --> 01:02:44,980
the data and communicating internally so that gets to what i call switching costs it's a whole

725
01:02:44,980 --> 01:02:51,620
discussion at uh mba level that we talk a lot about once something becomes adopted by your

726
01:02:51,620 --> 01:02:56,660
customers and it's proven to be very effective it's really difficult to take it away from them

727
01:02:57,620 --> 01:03:03,220
and actually i will say the same keep using the same example if i gave you a brand new

728
01:03:03,780 --> 01:03:10,020
spanking you know best in class phone but i told you you had to give up your phone number for it

729
01:03:10,020 --> 01:03:18,740
and you had to change carriers for it would you adopt it you would okay most people would say no

730
01:03:18,740 --> 01:03:23,860
there's a couple that say yes so it's not an always absolute thing but the point is there

731
01:03:23,860 --> 01:03:28,580
are switching costs associated with everything similarly like if i said to you you could go to

732
01:03:28,580 --> 01:03:34,020
another university but it doesn't teach your course well of course even if that university is way

733
01:03:34,020 --> 01:03:40,260
less expensive and maybe easier to get to it doesn't teach what you need so it's what you're being

734
01:03:40,260 --> 01:03:44,740
delivered and how you're being delivered it and how difficult it is to adopt it that is important

735
01:03:44,740 --> 01:03:49,460
when you start to think about defensibility so think about network effects think about switching

736
01:03:49,460 --> 01:03:54,980
costs think about ip think about things that give your your customer a basis to work with you

737
01:03:54,980 --> 01:03:58,580
that causes them to say i wouldn't want to switch i wouldn't want to go anywhere else

738
01:03:58,580 --> 01:04:02,500
this is something that i've got used to and then my favorite example of this is follows

739
01:04:03,300 --> 01:04:09,380
so if i came up with a much better social network like you loved the way that you could post photos

740
01:04:09,380 --> 01:04:16,340
it was way easier but nobody else was on the network would you adopt it of course not nobody

741
01:04:16,340 --> 01:04:21,060
to share anything with that's why there's such huge defensibility in the networks that have been

742
01:04:21,060 --> 01:04:27,060
built like instagram and whatsapp etc so networks is a very good example of it and then data is a

743
01:04:27,060 --> 01:04:33,620
fascinating part of it so vivian's building a an actionable data product for marketers

744
01:04:34,740 --> 01:04:40,180
if your data gets broadly used everywhere and more and more marketers contribute to it so it

745
01:04:40,180 --> 01:04:44,500
becomes better and better what's your competitive advantage in what's your moat

746
01:04:46,340 --> 01:04:53,380
that i am going to be the person who understands the human face the most there you go you will have

747
01:04:53,380 --> 01:04:59,460
more data on why people are doing things what it is and by the way what vivian's doing is really

748
01:04:59,460 --> 01:05:04,820
fascinating she's giving people the ability to read what it is that users are responding to

749
01:05:05,460 --> 01:05:09,940
and if she has better data on that than everybody else guess what that's incredibly powerful for

750
01:05:09,940 --> 01:05:13,940
marketers and the more people that use it the more data she'll get the stronger a network

751
01:05:13,940 --> 01:05:20,020
effect will be the bigger her moat will be you're nodding but i'm making this up as i go is that

752
01:05:20,020 --> 01:05:28,020
true good all right so now it's your turn i want to have each of you take your value prop and tell

753
01:05:28,020 --> 01:05:34,660
me what you think could be i'll go back to the 3d's defensible disruptive and also discontinuous

754
01:05:34,660 --> 01:05:38,660
about it and let's help you do all do that so i'll walk around and make sure you do it so get

755
01:05:38,660 --> 01:05:46,340
your 3d's up and let's get some help for those i'm going to just tell you that everybody's coming

756
01:05:46,340 --> 01:05:54,100
up with very good 3d's so first of all i was most surprised by taste of Kenya because consumer

757
01:05:54,100 --> 01:06:01,060
products are very difficult to create defensibility with but um Zepora and her team have got a great

758
01:06:01,060 --> 01:06:05,780
answer to this and if i get this wrong tell me they've got tenure contracts that they're writing

759
01:06:05,780 --> 01:06:11,300
with people which is locking them into a situation sorry go ahead with the farmers

760
01:06:11,300 --> 01:06:15,540
which is locking them into a place where other people won't be able to compete as i understand it

761
01:06:16,100 --> 01:06:23,860
and then over here i was really excited when i heard a little bit about space health and why is it

762
01:06:23,860 --> 01:06:32,580
disruptive it's a new and scary we're always going to be going pretty obvious space in of itself is

763
01:06:32,580 --> 01:06:37,540
a whole disruptive industry it like changes the notion that we're actually bound to our planet

764
01:06:37,540 --> 01:06:41,700
very disruptive and it's actually becoming an industry because of that and there are a whole

765
01:06:41,700 --> 01:06:46,740
bunch of things that are changing because of the fact that we can access space very very interesting

766
01:06:46,740 --> 01:06:50,740
i mean we're thinking about all sorts of new industries as a result of that new materials

767
01:06:50,740 --> 01:06:56,260
that we might create new forms of for example life that we might explore etc so it's very disruptive

768
01:06:56,260 --> 01:07:02,660
okay so i was also very excited when i heard about cohort first thing i heard from them

769
01:07:02,660 --> 01:07:08,340
about what's disruptive sorry discontinuous is what used to be an education an analog is now

770
01:07:08,340 --> 01:07:13,380
being turned digital by them that's a great example very disruptive things going from analog to

771
01:07:13,380 --> 01:07:20,660
digital perfect example of discontent a discontinuity all right then we came to Sharon's new bike seat

772
01:07:21,380 --> 01:07:25,140
i was thinking oh bike seat that can't be that you know defensible but then

773
01:07:25,780 --> 01:07:30,260
i heard that what she's doing is actually measuring all the data in use while the bike

774
01:07:30,260 --> 01:07:35,940
seat is being ridden and the form of the bike seat is changing on the fly as a result of that data

775
01:07:36,980 --> 01:07:43,620
now the question that i didn't get to hear is why is it defensible uh defensible ip with the

776
01:07:43,620 --> 01:07:51,060
technology and then the other thought was like long-term contracts with bike share companies

777
01:07:52,100 --> 01:07:57,700
don't you think your data will become defensible at some point too that as well and it's important

778
01:07:57,700 --> 01:08:03,540
because women specifically in a lot of issues but in bike health issues are understudied as well

779
01:08:03,540 --> 01:08:09,460
so there's actually not enough data about that right all right so i could keep going around the

780
01:08:09,460 --> 01:08:14,660
room but just for time i won't i will encourage you all now to start thinking about instead of

781
01:08:14,660 --> 01:08:19,780
talking about better faster cheaper what do you do that's disruptive discontinuous and defensible

782
01:08:20,420 --> 01:08:24,100
because that's going to set you up for success and look at all the great ideas you have you've

783
01:08:24,100 --> 01:08:30,020
all got a great basis to go defend your business and to to make it really stand out in this breakout

784
01:08:30,020 --> 01:08:36,900
way so well done very very exciting okay so we're on to the last leg and this is the piece that

785
01:08:36,900 --> 01:08:42,100
hopefully will help you decide whether you've got a business that's worth pursuing and that's how you

786
01:08:42,100 --> 01:08:49,540
evaluated so your business or your value proposition needs to be something that is going to last and

787
01:08:49,540 --> 01:08:55,140
endure and be sustainable and so there are only a few frameworks here but they're quite important

788
01:08:55,140 --> 01:08:58,980
the first one is something i've already been testing with you as we've been going through

789
01:08:58,980 --> 01:09:05,220
this evening what was the situation before your product and what is the situation after your product

790
01:09:06,180 --> 01:09:14,260
so for argument's sake saline health if people don't get any cure for the challenges they address

791
01:09:14,980 --> 01:09:20,020
with going through menopause they're going to be out of work a lot and dysfunctional a lot

792
01:09:20,020 --> 01:09:23,460
and they're going to obviously have personal health issues on top of all of that

793
01:09:23,460 --> 01:09:27,700
that may lead to other complications in their life so that's pretty clear what the before is

794
01:09:28,260 --> 01:09:34,420
the after is what would you say higher productivity among those women

795
01:09:35,300 --> 01:09:41,380
they just they just function normal and give back their life that like a high quality of life

796
01:09:41,380 --> 01:09:47,460
they should have so literally you could say acute pain or absolute joy and there might be a whole

797
01:09:47,460 --> 01:09:51,060
bunch of other things that you might expound on this and i'd encourage you to really go to the

798
01:09:51,060 --> 01:09:55,780
absolute extreme if you possibly can't say if their mothers for example that they might be able to

799
01:09:55,780 --> 01:10:00,900
look after their families and sustain that their livelihoods as mothers etc or if their

800
01:10:00,900 --> 01:10:04,260
workers obviously that they're you know they're they're supporting their community etc there's a

801
01:10:04,260 --> 01:10:08,980
lot of things that could could be great if they get their health back whereas if they don't they're

802
01:10:08,980 --> 01:10:14,580
dysfunctional in their their situation in life so try to bring those things out the other

803
01:10:14,580 --> 01:10:19,860
other thing thing about this is where you get challenged is when you are a consumer product

804
01:10:19,860 --> 01:10:25,220
and i i put um taste of kenya up here which is sometimes people will say something is well

805
01:10:25,220 --> 01:10:31,220
it's nice to have it's like a vitamin versus you know a morphine so i have a question for you

806
01:10:31,220 --> 01:10:36,340
because i know you've got the answer which is why do you think the before and after and in uh

807
01:10:36,340 --> 01:10:44,020
you know taste of kenya is so powerful so to the farmers if we don't serve them they're going to

808
01:10:44,020 --> 01:10:49,380
cut down their coffee trees so coffee is going to be extinct in kenya uh for the consumers

809
01:10:52,020 --> 01:10:57,220
they're never going to have a half to drink ever going to get to drink kenyan coffee okay

810
01:10:57,220 --> 01:11:02,100
so it's pretty much a national issue at some level the way you just described it which is great

811
01:11:02,100 --> 01:11:06,580
so anyway the before and after we want to make sure that you can say it in a way that this is

812
01:11:06,580 --> 01:11:11,940
something that's not a nice to have vitamin but it is really a necessary penicillin or morphine

813
01:11:11,940 --> 01:11:16,740
or something that is actually vital to their health now it's not always going to be the case

814
01:11:16,740 --> 01:11:20,980
but the more you can define it in those terms which is so critical to people they say okay

815
01:11:20,980 --> 01:11:25,220
yeah i've got to have that then the more likely you are to be able to say great i'm on to a good

816
01:11:25,220 --> 01:11:31,380
track so just because i'm again going to keep us on time i encourage you to just do this as a

817
01:11:31,380 --> 01:11:36,420
t diagram when you're doing your um your value prop just do the before and after and you can do that

818
01:11:36,420 --> 01:11:41,620
anytime obviously very easy exercise to do the more you can speak to your customers again back

819
01:11:41,620 --> 01:11:48,820
to this whole approach to don't ask this in a vacuum speak to your your user your customer and say

820
01:11:48,820 --> 01:11:52,340
tell me all your problems before and remember you want to get them to list those all as long as you

821
01:11:52,340 --> 01:11:56,740
can and then if we deliver this for you what will it look like afterwards what will be all the things

822
01:11:56,740 --> 01:11:59,940
that you'll be celebrating that you can now do that you couldn't do before whether it's getting

823
01:11:59,940 --> 01:12:04,180
your health back or it's whether it's drinking your favorite coffee or whether it's being able to

824
01:12:04,180 --> 01:12:08,260
for example get access to the engineering talent that you didn't have before or whether it's making

825
01:12:08,260 --> 01:12:12,420
sure your data actually is delivering the right insights that you need as in terribly there are

826
01:12:12,420 --> 01:12:16,020
all these things that you'll be able to do and that's critical to put out on your value prop

827
01:12:16,020 --> 01:12:22,740
make sense one question how do you actually make sure that that is something you could measure

828
01:12:24,420 --> 01:12:31,780
that's what this next framework is so the gain pain ratio is incredibly simple and yet very powerful

829
01:12:32,340 --> 01:12:36,820
and what it is is it's measuring the gain you deliver to your customer versus the pain for

830
01:12:36,900 --> 01:12:43,620
them to actually adopt what you do now i'm almost certain that all of you could tell me all the

831
01:12:43,620 --> 01:12:48,260
gain that you deliver but i'm almost certain that you probably couldn't tell me all the pain

832
01:12:48,900 --> 01:12:54,420
and the challenges of adopting it so let's talk talk you through an example so how many of you

833
01:12:54,420 --> 01:13:01,940
use venmo great me too became really obvious to me that first of all you know just sending money

834
01:13:02,100 --> 01:13:06,580
to pay for basic things and services why on earth would i write a check ever again

835
01:13:07,380 --> 01:13:12,340
totally the most dumb thing it's become so convenient it was very easy to use from the

836
01:13:12,340 --> 01:13:19,780
minute i started using it however it wasn't always that way and the pain that first went on

837
01:13:19,780 --> 01:13:25,060
as venmo got first adopted was it was yet another app for users to use they had to connect it to

838
01:13:25,060 --> 01:13:30,420
their bank and they weren't sure whether it was really secure and to start off with not everybody

839
01:13:30,420 --> 01:13:36,340
had it so it wasn't really that useful because the network didn't exist and this is sort of the

840
01:13:36,340 --> 01:13:40,820
cold start problem that a lot of you might have with your idea so you got to think about all

841
01:13:40,820 --> 01:13:45,140
of that and you also got to remember all those things so here's my tip for you which is super

842
01:13:45,140 --> 01:13:51,460
easy which is when you go to talk to your customer don't pitch them your idea again ask all the

843
01:13:51,460 --> 01:13:57,780
reasons why they have pain but then ask them this one question what are all the reasons you would

844
01:13:57,780 --> 01:14:06,660
not buy my product so why would you not buy this product tell me all the reasons and keep asking

845
01:14:06,660 --> 01:14:11,140
that question over and over and over again until you get them to tell you all the pain points they

846
01:14:11,140 --> 01:14:16,260
would have i can give you a clue about some of them number one is well i don't really need it that

847
01:14:16,260 --> 01:14:21,860
badly so guess what i could use the alternative well that's a bad starting point so you're gonna

848
01:14:21,860 --> 01:14:25,940
have to figure out you know why and what is it that they don't like about the alternative that

849
01:14:26,020 --> 01:14:30,740
actually if you gave them something way better they might use it the second might be cost that's

850
01:14:30,740 --> 01:14:35,380
always an easy excuse but then there's other things that are not so obvious like for example

851
01:14:35,380 --> 01:14:41,060
training how do i retrain people to use this new approach to doing things or if you're selling a

852
01:14:41,060 --> 01:14:45,700
bike seat it might be as basic as well my supply chain is already in place and i don't want to

853
01:14:45,700 --> 01:14:49,460
change and disrupt that it's too easy for me to just buy all the component parts i have they're

854
01:14:49,460 --> 01:14:53,380
already cheap and you'd slowed all down i've had to design this new bike seat in and get all this

855
01:14:53,380 --> 01:14:58,340
new data you know flowing into this new device and that'd be a new complication for me to worry

856
01:14:58,340 --> 01:15:02,660
about how is that all going to fit with this thing i sell already very effectively called a bike i'm

857
01:15:02,660 --> 01:15:07,780
making it up but it's the kind of thing you want to pull out before you you know end up saying okay

858
01:15:07,780 --> 01:15:13,940
i've got my value prop nailed so let's keep going with the venmo example the other thing that's always

859
01:15:13,940 --> 01:15:21,060
there is a startup in the middle of this equation is inertia and the risk of you as a startup being

860
01:15:21,060 --> 01:15:26,900
something that a customer is going to rely on so do i really need this is one of the things but

861
01:15:26,900 --> 01:15:33,380
also what happens if i put my money in this network and this startup fails i just lost

862
01:15:33,380 --> 01:15:37,780
whatever money i was sending to people that's a huge risk people don't want to do that unless

863
01:15:37,780 --> 01:15:44,340
they feel like oh this is like bank like security so these are things that you have to think about

864
01:15:44,340 --> 01:15:48,980
upfront by the way there's some things that you know these products often don't think of initially

865
01:15:48,980 --> 01:15:54,340
such as well how can i split the bill and do the tips then we figured that out and eventually

866
01:15:54,340 --> 01:16:00,180
they got through that issue so whatever it is that you have assume that there's a reason why people

867
01:16:00,180 --> 01:16:04,820
will initially resist you even if it's just that you're a startup and they don't take a risk on you

868
01:16:04,820 --> 01:16:10,180
and think about how you'll overcome that so now the question is what's the right ratio

869
01:16:11,060 --> 01:16:14,020
of gain to pain before somebody will take a risk on you

870
01:16:14,100 --> 01:16:22,500
anybody want to take a guess yep go ahead no pain well that would be awesome so it'd be infinite

871
01:16:22,500 --> 01:16:29,700
so your ratio is infinite i love it all right go ahead dan why 10 to 1 because you got to get

872
01:16:29,700 --> 01:16:35,780
people over that activation energy yeah to me get excited about your product and make it a priority

873
01:16:35,780 --> 01:16:43,060
yeah so what's interesting about bigger faster better sorry cheaper better faster is do you think

874
01:16:43,060 --> 01:16:50,420
30 to 90 cheaper is going to cause people to do something to change how might they might use

875
01:16:51,060 --> 01:16:54,260
for example their travel and what it caused david's business to take off

876
01:16:56,660 --> 01:17:00,340
we're not asking david so we're asking you anybody what does anybody think

877
01:17:01,700 --> 01:17:10,340
yes yeah i would say for certain users yeah so why i always say this there are not answers here

878
01:17:11,300 --> 01:17:16,180
i would agree with both viewpoints so for certain classes of user for example if you are selling

879
01:17:16,180 --> 01:17:19,860
to a pharma company and they're you know doing experimentation i would say 10 to 1 is probably

880
01:17:19,860 --> 01:17:24,580
right because it's very expensive for them to go change their workflows to develop new drugs

881
01:17:24,580 --> 01:17:30,500
but for a consumer if you're going to offer a 30 to 90 cheaper solution david might really

882
01:17:30,500 --> 01:17:34,580
be onto something i would want to you know save that money maybe even 10 percent would be enough

883
01:17:34,660 --> 01:17:40,900
for the threshold maybe not maybe 20 maybe anyway you get my point you've got to measure this

884
01:17:40,900 --> 01:17:45,220
and you've got to ask your user and you've got to be clear what's the threshold view on the gain

885
01:17:45,220 --> 01:17:49,700
pain ratio where you would make a change that would make you take the risk and get over the inertia

886
01:17:49,700 --> 01:17:55,940
that's why this is such a useful formula can i ask a question about that example um because i feel

887
01:17:55,940 --> 01:18:01,460
like there's the pain of maybe like switching platforms you normally use to look for travel but

888
01:18:01,460 --> 01:18:09,300
it strikes me that with that particular example there's another pain of changing the way you travel

889
01:18:10,260 --> 01:18:16,340
because you're not putting in a destination so i'm wondering how you think about those two because

890
01:18:16,340 --> 01:18:22,100
one seems like more a longer term shift that you're trying to prompt so i'm going to let you and

891
01:18:22,100 --> 01:18:27,940
david debate that afterwards but because it's it's specific to him the principle though is still the

892
01:18:27,940 --> 01:18:33,460
same which is what you're asking david to do is say david why would i take this risk and why would

893
01:18:33,460 --> 01:18:39,140
i use your service versus what i'm already doing and i'll give you an answer that i think is important

894
01:18:39,140 --> 01:18:44,100
to sort of use in a general sense so that it's not about david's business which is if the customer

895
01:18:44,100 --> 01:18:48,180
has something that they're comfortable with and you really are not giving them at least an order of

896
01:18:48,180 --> 01:18:52,900
magnitude improvement in something or a significant gain in something they're not going to do anything

897
01:18:52,900 --> 01:18:57,380
life's too short they're too busy they'd rather just carry on doing whatever they're doing the greatest

898
01:18:57,380 --> 01:19:01,780
inertia and the greatest reason that people fail is because they're not solving a valuable

899
01:19:01,780 --> 01:19:05,940
enough problem that where the gain pain ratio is big enough that somebody will make a change

900
01:19:06,580 --> 01:19:11,140
or that'll adopt something and it can be on either side of this equation too by the way

901
01:19:11,140 --> 01:19:14,740
for example let's use an example a case in point that we've all experienced which is

902
01:19:14,740 --> 01:19:21,060
it's incredibly easy to download an app it's point click download the app so that pain if you

903
01:19:21,060 --> 01:19:25,780
will of trying something is incredibly low but then if you start using it and it's no good it's

904
01:19:25,780 --> 01:19:32,420
also incredibly easy to just point click delete so you've got to find something that is really

905
01:19:32,420 --> 01:19:38,740
valuable on a sustainable basis for somebody and ideally make it so easy for them to adopt it that

906
01:19:38,740 --> 01:19:43,780
it's going to be a very successful go-to-market motion for you when you start selling it and

907
01:19:43,780 --> 01:19:47,860
that's what this pain gain ratio is all about so by the way venmo did some very clever things they

908
01:19:47,860 --> 01:19:52,980
added all these security measures they made sign up so easy for example you could just scan a qr code

909
01:19:52,980 --> 01:19:59,540
to pay in certain situations and there are a whole set of things that became obviously so simple

910
01:19:59,540 --> 01:20:04,980
that we've all adopted it and it's now friction-free and because the network's there we talked about

911
01:20:04,980 --> 01:20:10,660
that too it's obviously got huge defensibility because nobody else is going to just disrupt that

912
01:20:11,220 --> 01:20:15,460
because all the people that you already pay on venmo it's just one click for you to pay them

913
01:20:16,500 --> 01:20:22,100
obvious stuff right so let me make sure that you get a clear idea of what are the things to

914
01:20:22,100 --> 01:20:27,700
look for on gain pain so first of all on the gain is pretty obvious you know how much money do you

915
01:20:27,700 --> 01:20:30,820
make people how much time do you save them all that stuff you're going to you're going to nail

916
01:20:30,820 --> 01:20:37,860
that I know that's not the problem on the pain side don't forget how you are going to have to help

917
01:20:37,860 --> 01:20:44,740
people find you try you buy you adopt you get trained into your system and everything else

918
01:20:44,740 --> 01:20:51,140
that's associated with owning you all of that is pain all of that has to be factored into your gain

919
01:20:51,140 --> 01:20:56,260
pain ratio and in the middle don't forget all these things that are associated with what ultimately

920
01:20:56,260 --> 01:21:01,060
come down to risk and are inertia for people to change anything if you do that you have the basis

921
01:21:01,060 --> 01:21:05,380
to evaluate your value prop and you're in the power seat at that point because you can keep telling

922
01:21:05,380 --> 01:21:10,900
yourself your thing's great but until you see that tipping and customers are pulling you to market

923
01:21:10,900 --> 01:21:14,900
and saying yep this is really something I've got to adopt you know you haven't got it right

924
01:21:15,860 --> 01:21:22,900
so uh teraflow was easy for me to to pick down I would say you have work to do on your your gain

925
01:21:22,900 --> 01:21:29,940
plane because the way you expressed your value prop is very clear like for you know translational

926
01:21:29,940 --> 01:21:35,060
scientists and we know the who is for with traditional r package you know ours of those of you

927
01:21:35,060 --> 01:21:41,540
don't know hugely widely adopted language that's used for statisticians um due to you haven't quite

928
01:21:41,620 --> 01:21:45,860
got the unmet needs yet so that's great you probably can figure that out I might say based

929
01:21:45,860 --> 01:21:51,220
on what I've learned the inability to gain the insights necessary to define the data data path

930
01:21:51,220 --> 01:21:57,060
for them uh teraflow offers the platform but allows scientists to extract clinical breakthroughs

931
01:21:57,060 --> 01:22:01,380
now you're going to have to decide how will you declare that as at least an order of magnitude

932
01:22:01,380 --> 01:22:06,260
since that's the term you came up with better than the alternative of doing nothing because

933
01:22:06,260 --> 01:22:13,540
otherwise they will do nothing make sense okay good so I will just simply say we got to the end

934
01:22:13,540 --> 01:22:18,260
naturally otherwise which is you already know where we're headed I already told you what the

935
01:22:18,260 --> 01:22:22,580
value prop is I gave you the statement up front now what I'm going to just just put it all together

936
01:22:22,580 --> 01:22:28,420
for you which is this value prop statement is actually built by all the frameworks we just took

937
01:22:28,420 --> 01:22:36,900
you through and again this is in the workbook so the four piece defining who it is for use this

938
01:22:36,900 --> 01:22:41,620
minimum viable segment again that's in your workbook I drew it very briefly here and talked about

939
01:22:42,180 --> 01:22:47,620
how do you find the same needs that you can address with your first product don't get pulled

940
01:22:47,620 --> 01:22:51,620
all over the place find a set of users for whom you have the same needs your minimum viable segment

941
01:22:52,260 --> 01:22:58,340
check that they are blatant and critical needs ideally rather than latent and aspirational

942
01:22:58,340 --> 01:23:02,740
that's the black and white framework or if they start latent and aspirational be clear how you're

943
01:23:02,740 --> 01:23:08,020
going to get them the question that Victor asked from just using something that was just a basic

944
01:23:08,020 --> 01:23:12,180
platform a basic product like an iPad to a place where it becomes mission critical

945
01:23:13,700 --> 01:23:19,780
and then how do you define what's urgent and underserved and unworkable etc that's the four

946
01:23:19,860 --> 01:23:24,820
use if your audience tells you that if your customer tells you that then you know you're

947
01:23:24,820 --> 01:23:27,620
dealing with the right customer and you've identified the right pain points for them

948
01:23:28,340 --> 01:23:31,940
same with what are they dissatisfied with things that are unworkable

949
01:23:32,740 --> 01:23:38,020
if they really are unworkable they're not going to put up with it and if they're underserved in

950
01:23:38,020 --> 01:23:42,340
other words they're not being able to get for example the coffee they need or for example the

951
01:23:42,340 --> 01:23:47,620
comfort they need or the travel access they need or the safety they need or the health they need

952
01:23:47,620 --> 01:23:52,740
etc then spell it out that's where it'll go in your value problem and then don't just say it's

953
01:23:52,740 --> 01:23:57,940
faster better cheaper tell people why it's disruptive and it's a discontinuous innovation

954
01:23:57,940 --> 01:24:03,780
it's gone digital as opposed to used to be analog or it's now online and accessible and then

955
01:24:04,500 --> 01:24:09,540
it provides something which you want to make sure they are very clear is an order of magnitude

956
01:24:09,540 --> 01:24:15,540
breakthrough and that's where you use the gain-prane ratio you don't just say it's x you say it's

957
01:24:15,540 --> 01:24:22,500
10x and here's why because for you to adopt it even with the pain of you know retraining etc

958
01:24:22,500 --> 01:24:28,180
you're going to get this enormous gain that is compelling and then finally it's unlike the

959
01:24:28,180 --> 01:24:33,140
things that at the moment are also unworkable for one reason or another or are not addressing your

960
01:24:33,140 --> 01:24:40,340
need or underserved it's your value problem so with that we're finishing one minute early now

961
01:24:41,300 --> 01:24:42,980
any questions before we wrap up

962
01:24:44,980 --> 01:24:48,820
yeah go ahead Sappora could you please walk us through the black again

963
01:24:50,580 --> 01:24:56,420
so a lot of products might start out as being something that in this framework

964
01:24:58,660 --> 01:25:08,100
latent and aspirational in other words people would like to have this is a nice to have

965
01:25:11,220 --> 01:25:14,740
but really where you want to get to is a place where it's blatant

966
01:25:17,860 --> 01:25:18,580
and critical

967
01:25:22,100 --> 01:25:27,460
so this is a must-have so i don't need to tell any of you this but

968
01:25:28,180 --> 01:25:35,220
all the things that are subsistence for you are must-haves food water health anything that

969
01:25:35,220 --> 01:25:41,540
enables you to do your job they're all must-haves all the things down here like well depending

970
01:25:41,540 --> 01:25:47,700
on the thing you like but you know what you spend your money on is your business but entertainment

971
01:25:47,700 --> 01:25:52,820
might be a nice to have in certain circumstances compared to health pretty obvious to state that

972
01:25:52,820 --> 01:26:01,700
or fashion might be a nice to have versus comfort i mean versus you know it's winter in boston so

973
01:26:02,580 --> 01:26:07,380
things that protect you from the cold i mean there's just basic ways to define things that

974
01:26:07,380 --> 01:26:12,500
are nice to have versus must-haves the more you can understand how you move from the nice tab to

975
01:26:12,500 --> 01:26:18,180
the must have the better does that make sense great okay so i'll let you come up and ask any

976
01:26:18,180 --> 01:26:22,500
questions you like but i want to finish now on time so thank you very much for for joining in on

977
01:26:22,500 --> 01:26:28,100
this i will say that the most important thing in all of this is that it's built around you so if

978
01:26:28,100 --> 01:26:32,500
you don't uniquely understand the problem you're addressing then why are you doing it

979
01:26:32,500 --> 01:26:36,740
because you're going to face a lot of competition from people who do know better than you then which

980
01:26:36,740 --> 01:26:41,860
case what can your solution deliver uniquely well is what we've been spending all this time on

981
01:26:41,860 --> 01:26:47,060
based on what you know that also can be built around you and finally if you can bring that

982
01:26:47,060 --> 01:26:50,980
all together around what we talked about last time around a disruptive business model then it's

983
01:26:50,980 --> 01:26:56,660
going to be sustainable and so this is oftentimes what people refer to as founder market fit it's

984
01:26:56,660 --> 01:27:02,500
why you are uniquely in a position to solve this particular value prop and and do it in a way that

985
01:27:02,500 --> 01:27:08,340
is sustainable with a business model that we talked about last week so in summary have fun defining

986
01:27:08,340 --> 01:27:13,300
it have fun evaluating it and make sure it's built around you and you'll have a great company thanks

987
01:27:13,300 --> 01:27:25,940
very much it's been a pleasure
