0	12560	Value props is one of the most important things that we could possibly spend time on because
12560	16840	the number one reason that companies fail is because they're not solving a valuable
16840	21920	enough problem and therefore they don't create the value that's worth investing in and therefore
21920	25720	they fail in their basic form of meeting a need.
25720	30280	So what we intend to do today is to both help you understand how to define the problem
30280	35000	you're addressing or the opportunity you see and then actually evaluate it and then finally
35000	36600	create it.
36600	39800	And this is one of the few workshops where I'll tell you that we do have an answer.
39800	43320	Usually you hear me say there are no answers that I'm going to ask a whole bunch of questions
43320	44320	of you.
44320	46960	The only answer I'm giving you though is a framework and it's a framework for where
46960	47960	we're going to go.
47960	52200	So let me jump right in and get you there so you can hear exactly from the beginning
52200	55240	how this framework set of activities is going to come together.
55240	58760	So as I said first of all we're going to define then we're going to evaluate then we're
58760	59880	going to build.
59880	62920	One of the things I want to tell you right off the bat is that I want to get rid of the
62920	65720	idea of ideas.
65720	69160	It's a terrible thing but most people come to me and they say I've got an incredible
69160	70360	idea for X, Y and Z.
70360	75520	Well ideas are to a penny, sorry I should say to a cent but what they really are is
75520	76520	free floating.
76520	80400	They don't actually have meaning until you can address some kind of a problem or opportunity
80400	81400	with them.
81400	83680	So that's why that first part is so important.
83680	86880	And then of course once you start building a value proposition we want to be able to
86880	90920	evaluate it so you yourself not me or anybody else can judge whether you've got something
90920	94080	that is really going to be compelling and cause people to buy.
94080	97080	And finally if you have then of course you want to build it and get it into a form that's
97080	98080	really crisp.
98080	102080	So it's an easy thing for you to do and everything from an elevator pitch to literally going
102080	106200	to a full on pitch for example to get a customer over the line or raise money.
106200	110360	In every instance though this framework, a set of frameworks should help you get that.
110360	112800	So I said we'd give you an answer.
112800	115640	This is the end of the session.
115640	122920	We want you to be able to actually build this framework and say for who that is dissatisfied
122920	129800	with what due to some unmet need or problem you offer a product that solves that and it
129800	133320	provides some key benefits that are compelling enough that people actually want to engage
133320	134520	with you.
134520	137960	So that's why we're headed this evening.
137960	141280	First thing in the value prop that we want to do is define.
141560	146000	The first statement sounds so obvious which is for who.
146000	149640	So I'm going to jump right in because I know that they've got a good starting point.
149640	151320	Connect Ed Gulnaz.
151320	154880	Tell me for who is your value prop.
154880	163240	So this is connected as a nonprofit so we bridge the digital divide for people in Kazakhstan
163240	170200	but we have to deliver I feel like the value proposition for organization that donate their
170200	174800	computers and devices to us and those who can fund us.
174800	179560	Okay so you went long way down into that but I want to make sure we really understand the
179560	180560	who.
180560	184680	So if you could say who it is for is it everybody in Kazakhstan?
184680	185680	Primarily children.
185680	191280	Okay so we want to say children okay.
191280	194360	What else could you say about them?
194360	198320	From marginalized communities and rural areas in Kazakhstan.
198880	200720	Okay marginalized.
200720	201720	What else?
203720	207120	Who don't have basic digital literacy skills.
207120	219600	Okay so basic digital literacy skills.
219600	221520	And you said the last thing is.
221520	223120	And they don't have equipment.
223120	226920	And they don't have equipment.
226920	231120	So this is why I picked Gulnaz because I've been lucky enough to have her in the class
231120	232120	before.
232120	236520	She didn't say my proposition is for everybody which would be very terrifying if it was by
236520	240760	the way because then how do you even pick where you go to market or how you reach that
240760	241760	customer etc.
241760	243240	She's got very specific.
243240	247680	I didn't write Kazakhstan because that's pretty obvious but it's children with marginalized
247680	251720	who are in a marginalized situation don't have basic digital literacy and they don't
251720	252960	have the equipment.
252960	256360	Now we can find out later how she's going to address their needs.
256520	258360	That's pretty clear right.
258360	264200	So anyway one of the teams at the iLab who put their value prop in for tonight was Comprofacil
264200	269800	and they very openly said they've got a product which is going to help people who are dissatisfied
269800	274720	with current credit products due to high interest rates get through a credit marketplace better
274720	276920	comparison capabilities.
276920	279600	Makes total sense but they didn't say for who.
279600	283800	Now that's a massive problem when you are building a business because if you don't know
283800	287800	who your customer is you don't know what the persona is that you're selling to and
287800	290520	how to focus or target on them etc.
290520	295840	And it just is the beginning therefore of why the value proposition statement is so important.
295840	298080	I will underline it by saying the following.
298080	301280	If you don't know who your customer is and you think it's everybody I can tell you you're
301280	306480	going to fail by default because trying to boil the ocean and sell to the world at large
306480	309760	is a very big undertaking for any company.
309760	312520	Even the largest companies in the world get very crisp about it.
312880	314080	Yeah and Tato.
315240	319760	Yeah I had a question and I think related to Golnath's business.
319760	325000	If your user is different from your customer who do you put on the for who?
325000	326320	Great question.
326320	328840	So user versus customer.
328840	331200	What do you think is the answer first of all?
334880	337560	Golnath will answer.
337560	338560	Anybody can answer.
338560	339560	Does anybody in the room have an answer to this?
339560	341680	This is a terrifically good question by the way.
341680	345240	This is the kind of thing that we really need to deal with too.
345240	347120	The user say more.
347120	348120	Why the user?
348120	352760	Well because customer is just the person who's paying it but user is who's benefiting
352760	354920	from what you're creating.
354920	355920	Great.
355920	361040	Now does it mean that one or the other?
361040	362440	Or are both important?
362440	364040	Anybody else want to comment on this?
364040	365360	Yes go ahead.
365360	369400	I think when your user is not your customer you actually have to satisfy two different
369400	370400	value propositions.
370400	374600	You have to provide value to the initial funder whether that's philanthropy or government
374600	378880	but you also have to provide value to the user so you have uptake.
378880	380200	Okay.
380200	381920	So this is really important.
381920	384720	This which is I'll just use the word pull.
384720	385720	You need the pull from the user.
385720	388400	If the user's not using it nobody's going to pay for it.
388400	393880	But even if the user is using it the person who's got to pay for it whether it's a government
393880	399080	if it's a non-profit situation or it's somebody in IT for example who's the gatekeep of something
399160	403560	they still are going to need the user to convince them that there is a payoff that makes it
403560	405960	worth them investing in this product or service.
405960	409880	So both are important but I really agree with Victor by the way you've got to start with
409880	410880	the user.
410880	414240	Like if the user is just not getting the value from your value proposition that's the whole
414240	417640	point of this class then we're in the wrong place.
417640	424400	So this piece of definition is what we're trying to get to with the who and when you
424400	428120	see and by the way I don't think we have it this semester but the startup secrets class
428120	432080	on go to market which by the way is on the iLib YouTube channel.
432080	436360	You will see we talk about personas and this is one of the things that we talk about is
436360	443080	how do you get to all parts of the persona that is going to be the champion for your
443080	448000	product or service in whatever enterprise or government or non-profit you're selling
448000	449000	to.
449000	451560	So very important question thank you very much for that.
451560	454720	Any other questions on who before we move on?
454720	455720	All right good.
455720	459560	The key word here is ultimately segment.
459560	462480	So if we're not going to sell to everybody we need to find a segment of people that we're
462480	467320	going to sell to and the trick of this is actually in your workbook so I'm not going
467320	471160	to pitch it to you tonight because it's a significant thing to go and spend some time
471160	475160	looking at and that is to define your minimum viable segment.
475160	479760	I'll just define it for you as simply as this which is to say you're all going to get to
479760	486280	learn about building the smallest product you possibly can your MVP and if the whole
486280	491920	market out there the whole world was where you went and targeted that then this would
491920	495680	very quickly get pulled in all sorts of different directions for all the potential users that
495680	499280	could use your product or service and they all have different needs.
499280	505400	The MVS simply says you want to find one path where you get the same needs for the same
505400	511560	users that allows you to sell the same product over and over and over and over and over again
511560	514120	without you having to change the product.
514120	518280	You can learn a lot more about that in the workbook but that's the notion of a segment
518280	526800	and if you do this right then you end up with a minimum viable segment which is a good dance
526800	529480	partner as I call it to your minimum viable product.
529480	533840	Now does anybody in the room not know what these two terms are because they are terms
533840	538000	that have been built in start-up legacy for the last decade or so but it doesn't mean
538000	539800	to say everybody knows them.
539800	542200	Anybody have any questions on those?
542200	543400	All right good.
543400	549240	So only secret I want to give you here is one simple one which is you want to evaluate
549240	553920	this part of your who you're selling to through the eyes of the customer.
553920	557560	So we talked about who this is let's just focus on the user.
557560	562120	If the user can identify with the product you're selling you're on the right track.
562120	567280	What's the best way to find that out?
567280	575040	Yeah absolutely all of you can do this without spending a single penny just go out and talk
575040	579840	to them and if you're not clear that your user is identifying when you talk to them
579840	583360	with what you're trying to sell them they say well that's not me I don't buy that or
583360	588640	I don't need that or that's not a problem I identify with keep asking until you find
588640	594120	the person who says oh yeah that's the problem I have and keep asking until they say not
594120	597640	only do I have it but then that's where we'll start to get into more of the value proposition
597640	601440	but it's the pain there is big enough for me to actually start to engage with you but
601440	606400	everything you do should be looked at from your user's eyes not from yours in other words
606400	612400	don't pitch them anything ask them everything make sense I see a lot of nodding heads good
612400	617160	all pretty obvious so now that we've we've talked about defining who it's for we're
617160	621240	going to define what we're going to solve for them what problem we're going to define
621240	626880	for them so there's a famous statement here and it's one of my favorite which is a problem
626880	632680	well stated is half solved and the reason that's true is that if you can really clearly
632680	637280	identify what the pain or need or opportunity is that you're going to address becomes very
637280	641880	easy to start getting your team to focus on well what product or service will you build
641880	645800	but imagine if you get in the room and the opposite is true there's five engineers you've
645800	650560	hired for argument sake or five people you're working on a service building a service for
650560	655560	and you can't even agree what it is you're building and or if you didn't do the first
655560	659320	part who you're building it for that's where a lot of startups go wrong by the way is they
659320	665040	can't get that crisp to say we need to solve this particular pain point this hair on fire
665040	671320	pain point for people first so now the question is what's the best way to go about doing that
671320	677480	here are a few frameworks for you first of all this one is a very simple one it's for
677480	687200	use think about problems that are unworkable unavoidable urgent and underserved so those
687200	691640	of you with boards I'm going to recommend you put up just for use and just take a moment
691640	698040	to think about as you are thinking about for example Vivian framing your idea what about
698040	702880	it is unworkable unavoidable and underserved and urgent and I'm going to take you through
702880	706400	each of these I just wanted you to capture the four use on your board so Selene if you
706400	709360	do this I'm sorry stellar if you do the same for Selene health just put them up on the
709360	713320	board for the moment just want to get us used to kind of creating the basis for we can go
713320	716560	through and you're all going to build out your value propositions on your board so just
716560	725480	to be clear so the only person I didn't meet is Sharon hi welcome good to have you here
725480	733200	I know you're building a new kind of bike seat can you just tell us what it's about
733200	739760	yeah I do not yet have a name hence just the word bike seat but I'm specifically looking
739760	744280	at solving the problem of some of the long term health issues that are caused through
744280	749000	for women through biking and I'm doing that through looking at how to design a bike seat
749000	754480	that reduces pressure and friction that's perfect I don't even need to go any further
754480	761000	so I'm going to just ask you to put up these four use and tell me why in your own words
761000	766680	for the moment just one example of something that you think is either unworkable unavoidable
766680	770120	or urgent or underserved you don't need to tell me right away but I'm going to take you
770120	774000	these frameworks and I'll come back to you so I'm giving you a heads up that I'll come
774000	780040	back to you and ask you great now that you've got these let me take you through them so
780040	786200	unworkable is sort of obvious but it's really interesting some people think they've got
786200	790720	an unworkable problem but the real definition of something that's unworkable is that it
790720	796160	is going to cause a problem that when this happens the consequences are so great that
796160	801200	somebody could get fired for it so let me give you an example because it's a very interesting
801200	807160	one and you might have all lived through it so when the iPhone first got introduced people
807280	812520	were lining up to buy them that was the great news the bad news was when they got them they
812520	817000	couldn't get them activated and worse still when they did get them activated all the iCloud
817000	820280	services to do things like download their contacts and their calendars weren't working
820280	827600	either so that problem was so bad so unworkable a lot of people got fired in fact Steve Jobs
827600	833020	was quite famously on a tirade about it and it was a problem that was created by a brand
833020	838860	new technology in a mass market and with a lot of people that obviously were very unhappy
838860	843300	about it and today guess what when you buy an iPhone it's pre provisioned you already
843300	847980	have all of that worked out and that took years actually to figure out I happen to be
847980	851500	one of the investors in a company that solved that problem for carriers on the other side
851500	857180	of this like AT&T was worth tens of millions of dollars just fixing that workflow and making
857180	860860	it possible for you to just pick up an iPhone and turn it on and effectively get your new
860860	865860	number working so these unworkable problems do get people fired they're that painful and
865860	870700	they cause all sorts of things now ideally they're much more interesting than that so
870700	874580	for example we've got social problems where you've got things that are causing people
874580	880980	to get sick or for example not able to get education or like Connected not able to get
880980	886940	that right resources that will help them in a desperate situation then that also is unworkable
886940	888540	you will have your own way of saying it.
888540	892700	Gulnaz would you say what you think is unworkable about Connected?
892700	901500	If I understand it correctly if so if we teach digital literacy skills that kids cannot use
901500	906540	yeah that's useless kind of well no let's put it the other way around what happens if
906540	911540	you don't solve the problem if we don't solve the problem so we are trying to close the
911540	921460	socio-economic gap in Kazakhstan that is also caused by educational inequality okay but
921460	927020	what if what happens in Kazakhstan if we don't solve the socio-economic gap what happens
927020	935420	to Kazakhstan yeah I mean the one example is like people protest this year and there
935420	944260	was like a huge wave of unhappy people great so I mean this it's it's important and I
944260	948140	want to make sure that we give gave you airtime for this not every problem that comes through
948140	952820	the iLab is a problem that's technology like the iPhone's not you know getting to to work
952820	956900	it can be a social problem like this is a really big challenge for a nation that's trying
956900	962060	to develop its people that they can't get the education the resources they need it causes
962060	967100	huge unrest great unhappiness and guess what that population is not going to get out of
967100	971420	their third world status unless they get the education they need this is a really unworkable
971420	976260	problem this is one of the biggest problems of our time is that we have huge social divide
976260	979860	so thank you for addressing it and thanks for taking that mission up that's an example
979860	985620	of an unworkable problem anybody got any questions or an idea of where their particular thing
985620	990460	is unworkable today so I don't know whether let's see who have I not talked to you so
990460	999380	far cohort is there anything about what you're doing that's unworkable we're looking largely
999380	1006660	at the improving the graduation rates for black students yeah right what happens if we don't
1006660	1014540	do that if we don't do this 20% of students won't graduate from high school okay so yeah
1014540	1019220	I don't even need to say any more than that that's a big problem 20% of students have you
1019220	1026260	got the data on that already can you show that show that to people yes is public data
1026260	1030180	right yeah so you're in a great place because you're already starting the problem that's
1030180	1034460	unworkable you can give data behind it and there are real consequences for that which
1034460	1038740	is again inequality in our society through not being able to educate people interesting
1038740	1042940	enough you guys should be talking about how do you connect that and yourselves about how
1042940	1046420	do you make sure that your value prop comes to life in that way but thank you for sharing
1046420	1055300	that anybody got any yeah go ahead sure Facebook for instance what unworkable problem did they
1055300	1062980	solve so the good news about this is you asked what will open up a whole thread here as B
1062980	1070020	to B versus B to C and Facebook is obviously very much a B to C company and they're very
1070020	1074020	different sets of problems when you start talking about B to C generally speaking they're
1074020	1077860	not about unworkable or unavoidable they're much more about what we'll talk about which
1077860	1081940	is latent problems that are aspirational and that ultimately become blatant and critical
1081940	1087260	so we're going to get there but don't don't worry it's coming up any other questions on
1087260	1093540	unworkable first yeah go ahead how do you know that you're not actually hypothesizing
1093540	1098580	that this is unworkable because I can give an example but a lot of times what you think
1098620	1103780	is unworkable could just be something else and I'll go ahead and give an example just
1103780	1109220	to contextualize that for example oral cancer if you think that oh you may just need to
1109220	1114420	raise awareness but the problem may not be related to awareness the problem may be related
1114420	1121100	to access of care there's lack of access so you could say you know what's unworkable is
1121100	1125420	that there's no awareness and you would be blaming patients but in fact there's just
1125420	1132580	lack of care access to care so yeah you answered your own question by the way which is great
1132580	1137180	because you said quite rightly it might be this or it might be that and so what would
1137180	1141780	you do you'd keep drilling on the the question you asked yourself until you found what is
1141780	1150540	the root cause of it and so honest answer is many times the reason customers sorry startups
1150540	1154500	fail is because they don't do what you were doing which is to say well it could be this
1154620	1162220	it could be that who should you go to to ask the question it's on the board yeah just go
1162220	1167460	and ask the user okay tell me what the real problem is here tell me what's at the root
1167460	1173060	of this is it lack of awareness or is it lack of availability or is it my inability to use
1173060	1178140	the product or the service or whatever it might be that makes sense again the answer
1178140	1182180	is going to be so obvious when I said 90% of the time it's going to be back to what I said
1182180	1186940	here which is ask the user get to the customer's viewpoint of this and let them tell you where
1186940	1191220	their pain is what the problem is and why they're not being able to get the solution to it sounds
1191220	1195980	so obvious but the more you do that the better better off your value proposition is to get
1195980	1203500	defined all right so next you unavoidable the good news is that everybody in this room faces
1203500	1213700	two completely unavoidable things what are they taxes and death absolutely right one
1213700	1221700	of the joys about our lives is that it it does eventually have to come to an end and so taxes
1221700	1227940	and death or I put a bit more graciously aging a part of the reality of our lives but guess what
1227940	1233180	because of that there's a whole lot of money that gets made in both those industries like
1233180	1240820	the aging and the care that goes around that is a huge industry likewise paying tax is a massive
1240820	1245060	industry and I'm not just talking about QuickBooks and Turbo tax and all those things that that help
1245060	1251060	out with that it's actually a whole accounting industry that is spawned as a result of the
1251060	1254900	fact that we have to pay taxes we have to account for what we spend and we have to do all the
1254900	1260580	things that relate to that so why like this unavoidable part is there are actually a lot
1260580	1266340	of things that are not so obvious right up to your point earlier at the at the sort of
1266340	1273100	outset that seem unavoidable until you start to dig and you think about actually you know what I do
1273100	1276340	need to get my kids educated because if I don't get them educated they're not going to be able to
1276340	1281140	pay for themselves and get you know self-sufficient and be able to go and build their own lives etc
1281140	1286300	and so guess what education is pretty much unavoidable too so you know both of you have good
1287220	1295020	basis to talk about that it's unavoidable also for almost all societies to address that issue at
1295020	1300540	some level if they're going to be socially and sorry economically viable and so governments do
1300540	1305380	care about it so again you can get these things to work for you if you can find the right ways to
1305380	1310020	address them now one of the other things I always love to do here is give an example that is pretty
1310020	1320660	obvious but how many of you have had COVID at one point it was pretty unavoidable right so what
1320660	1327180	did we do we all when got vaccinated well maybe not everybody there was a choice but the point is
1327180	1333180	some health things are also unavoidable and some challenges like that are unavoidable and they
1333180	1338180	give rise to all sorts of opportunities some of you are even wearing masks in here totally
1338180	1342580	appropriate guess what that's a whole business that didn't exist beforehand and don't just think
1342580	1347540	about the mask think about every piece of the supply chain that builds a mask it's a huge business
1347540	1355100	that came up now we have testing testing has become a huge business because of COVID etc etc so
1355100	1359420	you see where I'm going with this it's not necessarily something that you face immediately
1359420	1363460	and say oh that's unavoidable but when you start to think about all the implications of it then you
1363460	1371500	realize there's lots of businesses that come out of it okay this one is easy urgent so I do
1371500	1377420	actually want to get another group involved here so Space Health Midori tell me a little bit about
1377420	1385460	what your business is or your idea isn't and why it might be urgent okay yeah thank you Space Health
1385460	1392380	has a goal of providing the commercial space sector with a medical professionals for the future
1392420	1398900	just what the expect didn't see that this industry is going to blow up and you know people that are
1398900	1407100	going to space for space tourism are going to need medicine in space very cool now I'm going to
1407100	1411260	challenge you though is that urgent like does everybody in this room feel like they are going
1411260	1417180	to need health as one of the first things that they spend money on in space I mean health in
1417180	1424460	space at least not now okay so and I'm not trying to take your idea down but it's one of the most
1424460	1429500	important criteria is to think about now let's just challenge that for a second and say but to
1429500	1434220	your point anybody who's going to space so that's the space user the customer if you like who's
1434220	1438420	came out to space I'm sure they feel like they want to check their health before they go and
1438420	1444100	they're going to need health and safety when they're up there so I'll eat my words and say if you
1444100	1449260	can find the right user if you can get in touch with whether it's the space agencies or the people
1449260	1453180	who are actually you know doing the experimentation up there I'm sure there's a tremendous
1453180	1458380	opportunity for space health so this is where parts the value prop need to tie together and so
1458380	1463340	you've got a tremendous opportunity if you can pick that segment that's the for who that really
1463340	1470980	clearly sees this as urgent and I'm sure they will so thanks for sharing okay so what is a tip
1471020	1477300	here for all of you is the following urgency is all relative so for those of you are not going to
1477300	1484500	space you could care less about this right so relatively for you it's not important now let's
1484500	1491940	take a reality in business which is if you're selling to somebody whether you intend to or not
1491940	1498540	you're going to compete with something or somebody and that time so lots of you all think you've
1498540	1506220	got a unique solution but here's the bad news there is finite amount of time money and resource
1506220	1512980	people and everything else that goes around what you're trying to sell into so you're always going
1512980	1517860	to have to be something that is at the highest priority if you're going to get people's attention
1517860	1522940	because guess what they won't spend time with you otherwise so it's no good for example trying
1522940	1528420	to sell a low-income family a very high-definition television set when they haven't even got the
1528420	1533900	basics of their food and water running or they aren't educating their family it's just obvious
1533900	1537860	when I say that well it's the same in truth in business too if you go in to try and pitch
1537860	1544740	somebody something for example that's a nice to have new extension for example to their existing
1544740	1550180	workflow system but they haven't got basic security in place and they've just been hacked you're not
1550180	1554700	going to get any attention so you have to think about what their priorities are now what's the best
1554700	1562740	way to find this out ask back to the same old question now I'll give you a little clue here
1562740	1568780	what you want to do here is say rather than even introduce what you do whenever you talk to your
1568780	1574980	potential user or customer ask them what their number one priority is right now don't ask them
1574980	1580180	about or don't tell them anything about you just say what's your number one priority if you get up
1580180	1585980	in the morning tomorrow what's the number one thing you need to focus on and why and then if they
1585980	1591700	tell you say when do you think you're going to get to number two and then let them tell you
1591700	1595700	number two oftentimes they won't even get to number two what you'll find out is that there's
1595700	1600060	some pain point that they really have that's really so compelling that's what they're focused on
1600060	1605260	and obviously if you can address that you're in a good spot if you can't expect to get delayed
1605300	1611940	and to get deep prioritized and to be spending time waiting to get engaged on your value problem
1611940	1617300	so that's why urgent is so important now let me give you another startup secret which is pretty
1617300	1623660	obvious which is that sometimes certain shifts in the market create urgency so a good example right
1623660	1630340	now is how many of you have mobile phones duh all of you right but if I'd asked that question 20
1630380	1637260	years ago it would be none of you that shift has been totally dramatic so what has it done to
1637260	1644980	every industry it's created urgency for people to respond to it when you bank today using your phone
1644980	1650220	pretty obvious you don't need to go to a bank for most of the things because you can do it all on
1650220	1656900	your phone again 20 years ago that wasn't the case and so banks had a very very urgent response
1656980	1661620	that they had to come up with to be able to make it possible for all the users that now said I don't
1661620	1665780	want to go to a bank and deal with a teller I just want to do it on my phone and the first
1665780	1669820	banks that moved there were actually not the existing incumbents there were a lot of new
1669820	1674940	banks that got started as a result of that trend so you want to look for shifts that create urgency
1674940	1679460	things like mobile I'll tell you there's another major one that's going on right now which is AI
1679460	1684820	AI is going to be involved in everything and so everybody's scrambling to figure out well how
1684820	1690020	do I engage AI to make my process more effective more efficient and save time and money for people
1690020	1695940	so urgency can be something that you also ride based on shifts in the marketplaces so I'm gonna
1695940	1702540	ask because I don't know anything about it what is CRSP design essentially we make low-cost so
1702540	1710660	affordable robotics toys for children starting out in South Africa and to use the framework that
1710660	1717540	we've got up here why is that urgent so when the idea originally started was a personal problem I
1717540	1723380	had 20 years ago when I was a child and I wanted to get into the space but growing up in a low-income
1723380	1732340	family nothing was affordable enough to be able to like for me to access it and then now if you
1732340	1739540	fast forward to like 2010 2015 the world was moving towards the 4IR fourth industrial revolution
1740020	1748420	and specifically for Africa we were lagging behind so this was an urgent like issue for me personally
1748420	1753060	being an engineer at the time realizing that our schooling systems weren't actually solving for this
1753700	1760500	and I think we also went forward to creating a sense of urgency by helping the government create a
1760500	1767460	curriculum for this so what this eventually did is now schools have started scrambling looking for
1767460	1774660	resources exactly like this so there are times when as the startup you can actually identify the
1774660	1781540	problem before the users even I don't know know they have it and then push forward policy or whatever
1781540	1786820	that then creates a new market then the issue becomes how do you capture value okay so we will
1786820	1792500	I'll hold that thought because I call that a latent need to a framework that comes up later
1792500	1796420	and it's interesting the way you described it too but I would say that's you're going to be challenged
1796500	1801300	with exactly the thing that I'm describing which is how do you get people to say this is more
1801300	1807140	important than 10 other things that we could be spending our resources on do you agree yeah so
1807140	1813700	that's why the urgent is pieces so important all right last you is underserved and this one is pretty
1813700	1818900	obvious I already gave it away there's only finite time money and resources for you to be able to
1818900	1824340	engage on things and so you have to help people understand why they should prioritize you but
1824340	1829620	the underserved piece is an interesting thing particularly in B2C marketplaces so anybody
1829620	1835460	got a B2C value proposition in here they're selling to consumers yeah of course you do taste of Kenya
1836020	1842180	so tell me about what do you think's underserved in the market for well it's a coffee market right
1842180	1847380	essentially yeah so at the moment Kenyan coffee consumers can't afford the Kenyan products in
1847380	1852820	the market so they buy instant coffee which is from Brazil so none of Kenyan coffee consumers
1853300	1858020	income can afford the coffee that's being sold in the market so you actually the beauty of your
1858020	1862500	solution is not only is it underserved in that people can't get the coffee from their own local
1862500	1869780	market but it's also too expensive so you've got two problems that you're addressing you know both
1869780	1874260	the pain it's unworkable for people who can't afford it and it's underserved in the sense that
1874260	1879060	literally there's no supply for it at the moment which is great thank you Zipporah so now that
1879060	1884420	you've all heard the four use I want you to just take a moment in your group and put down the four
1884420	1889620	use and take a moment for example on Taste of Kenya and put what one criteria is that you think
1889620	1894740	we just gave you two makes your product unworkable unavoidable urgent and underserved let's take a
1894740	1901540	few minutes on that in each group almost everybody's come up with some four use if not all of the four
1901540	1907140	use line I only have to look around the boards to see that so I'm going to just take one or two
1907140	1912260	boards and just ask for the rest of you to volunteer so first of all I was lucky enough
1912260	1920820	to listen to Celine health and Stella and Scarlett are serving a a market for women who obviously
1920820	1925380	have an unavoidable problem Stella and Scarlett do you want to just talk about that sure so
1925380	1932740	Celine house going to personalize manual puzzle management for mid-aged women or whoever enters
1932740	1938980	menopause even though they enter it early so the unworkable part is that when the climatic
1938980	1946660	symptom hits like hot flush night sweats and it hits it just really decrease their functionality
1947220	1953780	like among this woman so they cannot work so our solution can help them work that's perfect and
1953780	1959780	unavoidable it menopause is just unavoidable every like half of this room is going to enter
1959940	1964260	vulnerable we were talking about earlier aging it's just a reality for women yep urgent
1965460	1970980	just when the symptom hits when you are not feeling comfortable it is urgent that you
1970980	1975220	it's just like you get a flu and you need to take medicine or you need to do something you
1975220	1982420	stop going to work so that is an urgent problem you need to fix right and underserved so currently
1982420	1989540	if you search online to find articles or research dedicated to pregnancy this age
1989540	1996980	you have so many million billions of research results coming out but for menopausal age
1996980	2005060	this population you find barely like a hundred like one in a hundred of them yeah that little
2005060	2011060	so only two percent of the research funding are devoted to this population so this population
2011060	2018660	is underserved thank you very much so I had no idea about any of that although without revealing
2018660	2023300	who it is in my family I have somebody in my family who would say this is really a critical issue
2024180	2029300	and it does cause her to be literally unable to function at certain period of time and there's
2029300	2034020	way too little information about it and way too few solutions around it and many women go through
2034020	2038020	this so all those four yous felt very real to me as I was listening to that and I see a lot of
2038020	2042020	women in here who are nodding their heads around it so congratulations on finding such a great
2042020	2047860	four you problem all right just because of time I don't want to go around and do every board there's
2047860	2052260	too many boards here but I would love to give anybody a chance you had an to say who had an aha
2052260	2057140	moment I know you guys did for example but I want you to volunteer anybody have an aha moment when
2057140	2064900	they were going through their four yous and care to share yep go ahead so Hannah just left but
2066020	2072340	interestingly enough we started off with a bit of a debate and it turns out with some ideas and
2072340	2077540	I think with our one it could maybe be solved by just having a new policy in place not even
2077540	2084020	having a business or a startup you know so in those cases I don't know what that means in terms of
2084020	2091460	the problem you're solving is it one if it's too social focused that you actually can't solve it
2091460	2095700	as a business and you're better off joining government in lobbying internally well that's a
2095700	2101460	big aha by the way so one of the things that I always want to say when I mentor at the iLab is
2102020	2105620	don't be afraid to recognize what you're trying to do is not a good thing to do
2106580	2110020	uh really seriously because you you know this is your life so you don't want to spend it on
2110020	2115220	something that's not a real problem that you can solve as a startup and so what you just identified
2115220	2119540	I think is a great example of that you might realize that actually this is a problem that needs to be
2119540	2124100	solved in government first with policy so I actually want to give you a round of applause for being
2124100	2129300	that honest about it I think that's huge that was a big aha anybody else want to share an aha we'll
2129300	2139460	do one more yeah go ahead Dan for Terraflow um it's a it's a software that helps pharmaceutical
2139460	2144980	companies understand why the same drug works in some patients but not in others so normally when
2144980	2148740	I talk about Terraflow I talk about like cancer and the need to get the right drugs to the right
2148740	2154020	patients but I think really the the problem we're trying to solve is that usually our client is a
2154020	2160820	scientist that has kind of stuck their head out by convincing the pharma to fund this expensive
2160820	2167300	clinical trial and they have an unavoidable problem because they have to prove to their vice president
2167300	2172980	that this experiment was worth it and what our software does is basically provide a very clear
2172980	2177540	interpretable report that shows to other stakeholders that what they're doing is important
2177540	2181140	and if they didn't how much money would they lose potentially
2181460	2189700	um well if if the drug fails to go to market because they didn't discover the right biomarkers
2189700	2194340	it would be billions there you go so this is what we want to try to do and thank you Dan that was a
2194340	2199460	brilliant example is we want to try to identify the problem in a way that your user or your buyer
2199460	2203220	is going to say well of course I need to do this if I don't do this I'm going to lose billions my
2203220	2207620	drug may not get to market because I can't even identify the right biomarkers now you're going
2207620	2211300	to get people's attention now you're going to build something that is compelling that causes
2211300	2216500	people to act and want to buy that's why these four users are so important great example all right
2217460	2222900	next framework is a fun one it's actually one of my favorites because it addresses this question
2222900	2227940	that came up with b to c so I think it was you Vivian who asked about facebook so how many of
2227940	2234900	you use facebook or any of its derivatives like instagram or whatsapp good pretty much everybody
2235620	2242900	now if I was to say to you why I would argue that every one of you has what some people call
2242900	2248260	maslow's hierarchy of needs or some other you know form of it social needs security needs
2248820	2255540	physical needs emotional needs you know economic needs etc these are all needs we have and basically
2255540	2261620	if we don't have them met we end up in a bad place so what is it that facebook addresses for us
2262340	2270420	what need is it connection people it's a huge need do you know what the number one cause of
2270420	2278660	unhappiness in the world is loneliness the number one finding of the longest study at harvard ever
2278660	2287700	since 1938 of happiness is one thing connection when people have social connection they are happier
2287700	2293140	so this is a very big need that's what facebook addresses and by the way social networks in
2293140	2297540	general address now there's lots of other things to do I always joke about it on the other side
2297540	2303460	which is you know guess what we all want to meet people and date and eventually you know find
2303460	2308100	somebody to partner with and get married have kids whatever it is not all but generally speaking
2308100	2314500	that's a huge need so that's why things like bumble took off or at the other extreme why facebook in
2314500	2318580	the first place took off because people just wanted to connect to get together on on different
2318580	2324980	things that they had similar interests around huge huge things build from that so anyway b to c if
2324980	2330100	that makes sense different approach different framework but some similar principle at some
2330100	2335460	point it becomes unworkable for people for example that are in you know foreign nations to stay in
2335460	2340820	touch with their families back home without a social network whatsapp took off for that very
2340820	2346980	reason way too expensive to pick up the phone and call home tremendously cheap to do it on whatsapp
2346980	2353780	for free basically that's why it took off that was actually a critical need for people there are
2353780	2358900	whole industries that are built on that for example financial services in the third world is still
2358900	2363540	incredibly expensive to do things like do basic payments and send money around the place but
2363540	2370180	on social networks weibo and and tencent in china for example that was enabling of that and solving
2370180	2376420	of that problem all right so i have an example here that brings it all together and hopefully
2376420	2380580	it will be a useful one for you to see because it's sort of b to b and it's sort of b to c
2380580	2385940	does anybody use rent the runway there's a Harvard startup so yeah a couple of you have
2386660	2391060	okay uh just because you've talked vivian let me ask this young lady at the back
2391060	2397940	why do you use rent the runway i used it once like 10 years ago because i was going to um
2398900	2405460	i forget what event in dc and it was easy and i knew i would never need to wear that
2406100	2410340	like whatever i wore i knew i would take a lot of pictures in and not want to wear it again
2410340	2414900	okay great so few at the moment it was urgent in that moment you had to go to this event vivian
2414900	2422020	why did you use it same i am a foreigner i have basic clothes with me in the states only and as i
2422100	2428740	can see as you can see and i was invited for like a nice event and i couldn't show up in my ex-boyfriend
2428740	2435380	hoodie actually i think you should have done it would have been a real winner uh but that's
2435380	2440980	a whole other story so this is a fun story and for those of you don't his name is nicole
2445940	2449860	that particular garment should go on rent the runway that would make a lot of money
2450580	2455300	all right so the thing is this is a good example of saying that sort of crosses between b2b and b2c
2455300	2461060	in lots of different regards so um rent the runway in many ways is unworkable is an unworkable
2461060	2466020	problem for people who can't afford to go and find a dress or a or an outfit or something for a
2466020	2470420	particular occasion which they're going to go to sometimes it's a basic thing like a graduation party
2471140	2476180	and they want to show up it's also underserved in the sense that people can't afford to get
2476180	2481140	access to those things let alone uh you know do it for one particular thing and it's really
2481140	2485860	interesting by the way it's unavoidable for certain people who feel like they've got to show up
2485860	2489300	not in their boyfriend's hoodie but actually looking smart for their parents for example when
2489300	2495380	they're going to an event uh there's so many reasons why this is something that just was underserved
2495380	2500020	as a result because the only alternative solution to it was going and spending a lot of money
2500020	2505300	on a one-off basis that just made it completely unworkable so anyway lots of views about rent
2505300	2509300	the runway and one of the things that's interesting about it by the way is it's really struggled as
2509300	2514180	a business despite that and that's because its business model is tough and that's why we did
2514180	2520420	the session last time so working with a great value prop is not the only part of a business
2520420	2524820	that's important it's one part of it if you can't make it economically viable which is what we talked
2524820	2529540	about last session it's still not going to be sustainable so that's how to think about these
2529540	2533940	two workshops that we just did last time and this time together the second thing I promised to do
2533940	2540900	was to talk a little bit about the latent need that you brought up so there are oftentimes needs
2540900	2547300	that start out as latent meaning people don't think about them day to day they're not like at the
2547300	2553620	top of their mind and aspirational we just gave you an example which is a latent need is to look good
2553620	2558580	you don't necessarily think of it every day but you do want to get up and feel good and it's
2558660	2564340	aspirational also in the sense that when you're looking good and feeling good guess what you can
2564340	2568660	probably feel like more confident to do your job or your work or you know play your sport or whatever
2568660	2576420	else it is but certain needs evolve to becoming really critical and blatantly so so let's take
2576420	2585220	an example how many of you have an ipad do you think that's blatantly critical or is it latent
2585220	2594900	and aspirational critical tell me more tell me more yeah okay so it's turned into your main thing
2594900	2600180	that you take notes and everything else right okay good so there are people by the way who have the
2600180	2605700	other extreme anybody here feel like they're on the I just use it when I need to to watch a movie
2605700	2613060	or whatever Tata interestingly enough I had an ipad for a long time then I wasn't using it that much
2613060	2618420	I got to Harvard and then I was like oh snap I need a new one because everyone is using it then I
2618420	2623940	got into HBS classes and they're like no technology allowed so I sent back the one I just bought
2624580	2629380	so it went from like it wasn't critical then it was critical then I didn't need it anymore
2630180	2635140	well let me let me tell you why I use the ipad as an example because there's a vast array of people
2635140	2639860	use them for a lot of different things and some people would say yeah it's kind of nice and other
2639860	2644980	people would say no I got to have it and when it was first announced people joked about the name
2644980	2650420	and they said oh it's just a big iPhone why would I want one of those and it really didn't take off
2650420	2655700	for a long time until people started building applications for it and they became really critical
2655700	2661380	for certain people so for example if you're a pilot today you might use this for navigation and trust
2661380	2666180	me it's critical it's not like you're not going to take it with you this is what you use to make
2666180	2670900	sure you're going to get home so it depends on the application it's also true in medicine for
2670900	2674020	example that has become critical in certain situations where it's too difficult to use a
2674020	2679140	keyboard and people just need to write and they just want to for example touch something to actually
2679140	2685780	activate a particular function in an operating room so it depends on the application so what I try
2685780	2690740	to say about this framework is as follows try to understand your use case is it something people
2690740	2695860	think is just nice to have or is it really critical and if you can identify the difference
2695940	2700900	between something that's nice to have and must have guess which one you want to be in
2701700	2709620	duh you want to be in the top right there but again ask your user find out what they're doing
2709620	2715300	with it if the iPad had never made its way into medicine or you know flight navigation or those
2715300	2718420	other critical applications probably wouldn't have taken off but it's made its way into a lot of
2718420	2724180	those things and then for some users in the B2C class they critically consider their entertainment
2724180	2728260	to be like I gotta have entertainment this is a super important thing to me I don't need a
2728260	2732820	television I'll just have an iPad and there are people who've gone to YouTube as their basis for
2732820	2738500	educate I mean for entertainment so that's their interface for it anyway fun fun thing for you to
2738500	2743140	play with I encourage you to put your diagram out there and when you talk to users map where
2743140	2748740	they're telling you they are ask them how critical this is what else is a priority instead what else
2748740	2752660	would they do to what they spend their money on if it's not on what you're offering them
2753620	2759860	any questions on that before I move on yeah Victor just follow me up on that when they built the
2759860	2765460	iPad they didn't know they are going to need to build that many applications on it right yeah so
2766740	2771540	they didn't really solve a critical problem at the time of building the the application so how
2771540	2778180	would you think about if you have the chicken egg first or the egg first so let's take a moment to
2778180	2781700	answer Victor's question because it's a very important one which is you know the chicken and egg
2781700	2789620	question comes up a lot so you've got an idea and you think there's some opportunity out here in
2789620	2794180	the market I realize I've just drawn the same diagram I've drawn above but anyway it's starting
2794180	2801220	afresh the answer is that one of the most amazing things about Steve Jobs is he was somebody that
2801220	2805860	people said never talked to users he's famous for it he's like it was his idea to come up with the
2805860	2812180	iPad but what he was brilliant at was identifying it great vision for what this thing could be
2813460	2819300	and then he built the important piece which is a whole business opportunity for many markets
2819300	2826660	which is a platform that said anybody in here can take my device here use my platform and build
2826660	2833860	the application they particularly need and so guess what hundreds then thousands then tens
2833860	2838980	of thousands now millions of applications have been built for that platform and this is a business
2838980	2845380	model that is really fascinating and whole study in of itself that we could get into it's a very
2845380	2850420	viable way to build products what it really says is as follows you've got to make this platform
2850420	2856420	easy enough for your idea to be adopted by the users and to solve their own problem for example
2856980	2861780	you remember in the last session I told you that open source works this way it says that anybody
2861780	2867220	can take the code that you offer for example to create and I mentioned websites and Acquire and
2867220	2872580	Drupal the idea of a website and extend it any way they want to make their website capable of
2872580	2878020	integrating Instagram at one extreme and at the other extreme Salesforce to be able to do things
2878020	2883540	like give people a great experience when they go to the Grammys and take photographs and upload
2883540	2887300	them to the site and at the other extreme have a close relationship with all those customers so
2887300	2890340	they can keep selling them other things like records and merchandise and everything else
2891060	2895860	that is a whole industry now experience management and it was built on a platform
2895860	2900980	an open source platform just like the iPad was an open platform for people to develop applications
2902180	2908660	well a counter example would be pebble right they came up with spot collection and now they're gone
2908660	2910900	so great so what was wrong with pebble
2914580	2918980	anybody know this this particular product well you do so what what do you think was wrong with it
2920820	2926500	I don't know I think it fits the framework like it answers all the views and black and white question
2926500	2937220	but then really was it urgent it's as urgent as an Apple watch what was it open I think it runs
2937220	2942420	Android so various things that I I don't want to get drawn into this too much but I will tell you
2942420	2947780	I wrote an article you can find it on LinkedIn when I bought my first Apple watch I offered it
2947780	2951780	to anybody who wanted to tell me why there was a reason to keep it because I didn't think there
2951780	2956900	was a need for it it actually was a useless gadget when it first came out it was like it
2956900	2960660	didn't even stay on I had to do this to be able to look at the time I mean it was like
2960660	2964980	and there were no applications for it to speak of so I think it was a bit like the pebble and
2965620	2969860	what worked was that they had a development platform again and they had a large developer
2969860	2973780	user base who started create applications now there's no way I would give up my Apple watch
2974740	2978740	it's now used for some critical things like my health I monitor my sleep with it all
2978740	2982500	sorts of other things my blood pressure all sorts of things so it's become critical to me and by the
2982500	2987380	way actually for timekeeping which is a big part of my job that I need to get back on time it is
2987380	2992180	actually the thing that keeps me on time so with that I'll just simply say let's talk afterwards
2992180	2996420	because it's a great discussion like a lot of things there aren't answers but there are questions
2996420	3000500	you could ask in the frameworks that would reveal to you why pebble would be successful and why
3000500	3004820	apple watch sorry wasn't successful why apple watch was successful some of which by the way is
3004820	3010660	marketing too all right when you start building your product there are a whole set of things that
3010660	3016100	are basically dependencies that you want to be aware of and I talk about this in the workbook
3016100	3022820	because you need to get a couple of concepts clear and they basically are how your product
3022820	3029860	actually fits into the solution that the customer has and so I will say it and then you can go and
3029860	3037940	look in the workbook the first concept is that your product is very unlikely to be the whole
3037940	3044900	solution that a customer has and we started talking about smartphones so I'll just give you an example
3045780	3048740	why is a smartphone its own not a whole product
3051060	3054260	what what do you need with a smartphone to make it useful go ahead
3054420	3056500	apps apps yep what else
3058340	3063380	yeah absolutely it's absolutely useless into you unless you have a carrier and unless you have
3063380	3068100	some apps for it although I'd say one of the apps is built in which is the phone but the point is
3068100	3073540	that almost every product if you look at it has some aspects of it that need to make it a whole
3073540	3077700	solution for the customer so that's the first concept you'll find in the workbook the second
3077700	3083060	one is once you realize that you realize well actually you have dependencies on your product
3083060	3087300	being successful like if there weren't networks and I gave you the example that when the phones
3087300	3091380	couldn't be provisioned on networks they were just bricks they were useless or if you don't have the
3091380	3096100	app that solves your particular problem it's also useless to you so what you want to do is figure
3096100	3100420	out what are those dependencies those external factors that you need to work with in order for
3100420	3106420	your product to meet the needs end to end the solution if you will and if you don't pay attention
3106420	3110660	to those again you'll be selling something that can't really solve the problem that you're trying
3110660	3115140	to address so it's in the workbook you can go look it up there's some examples including apple
3115140	3120980	pay which is quite a fun one and also Tesla which is another fun one which is still to this day
3120980	3126580	having a big dependency on charging stations and the availability of electrical you know
3126580	3130100	access for people to really say oh I'm definitely going to buy a Tesla I know lots of people who
3130100	3134980	won't because they just know they can't rely on it so debt is an important thing to think about
3134980	3143540	next up is what we want to make sure happens in a positive way for you which is how do you make
3143540	3151140	sure you really do cut through the noise so every startup I know will say that they are
3151700	3157860	some way faster better cheaper you're all nodding your heads and I'm sure that that's
3157860	3162660	true for a lot of your things so anybody think that they are not faster better or cheaper
3162660	3166660	is probably not in this room they probably like decided oh I'm really not in the right place
3166660	3171540	David you're having a good laugh about this so are you working on something that you think is
3171540	3177540	faster better cheaper tell me more about it we're going to help David get beyond this by the way
3178820	3183780	so I'm in the the travel space so what I'm doing is I'm developing
3184020	3190180	an app that would help customers
3193140	3200180	find outrageously cheap airfares so what we're dealing with
3202100	3208660	at least you know I mean it could vary but 30 to 90 percent off okay
3208820	3218580	good I'm going to just hold that for a second is there any other thing about it that's that's
3218580	3223860	better because you said cheaper basically but is it better because it's faster or it's so
3224420	3232580	that would probably be the the tech behind it right so the sauce behind it I would call it
3234260	3237380	but to the customer is there any reason why they say oh this is way better it's a better
3237380	3243700	experience is it easier than travel velocity or you know pick if I so it it works in a totally
3243700	3252740	different form so basically the customer tells me where they want to leave from yep but they're
3252740	3258100	never telling me where they want to go to necessarily interesting so this is this sounds
3258100	3263380	interesting I'm just going to put it destinationless okay that's definitely different
3263460	3271620	so by the end of this class I want you to come up and tell me whether we can get rid of
3271620	3276100	but faster better cheaper and come up with a better framework for you and I'm going to start
3276100	3280500	talking a little bit about why I think it's a dangerous thing so the reason I hate faster
3280500	3284340	better cheaper is that there are people out there have more resource than you do as a startup
3285060	3290340	so if kayak or travel velocity or pick your favorite decided to come after you David they're
3290340	3296740	going to have more resource to try to put whatever it is the tech behind what they do and so there's
3296740	3301540	probably something in your secret source that is more than just faster better cheaper maybe it's
3301540	3306180	something that's defensible maybe it's some IP maybe it's something beyond the tech it's a network
3306180	3309860	the way you actually connect to people to get the data for your affairs there may be a whole bunch
3309860	3316420	of things but in the end we want to make sure that you end up there and here's why if you can get
3316500	3322180	to what we call a 3d breakthrough something that's truly disruptive truly discontinuous
3322180	3328900	and really defensible then you as a startup have a chance even with small resources in fact it's
3328900	3333460	the story of why startups succeed is that they make these big breakthroughs they punch through the
3333460	3338180	noise with something that's just completely disruptive like a business model like google had
3338180	3343460	to use advertising and selling sell instead of selling software to give away their office suite
3343460	3347780	where microsoft was having to get you to pay for it it was totally disruptive it caused
3347780	3352980	microsoft to be a dial tone as a stock for many years that's what we mean by this so let's get
3352980	3358820	into these 3d's and see if we can identify some for you so first of all disruptive is as I said
3358820	3364260	sometimes a technology but often a business model like airbnb changed the travel industry
3365780	3370580	they didn't actually invent anything they don't even own the homes that you go and visit or the
3370580	3376100	places you go and stay at what they created was a means to connect people and give them experiences
3376100	3382740	by sharing resources that other people were not using genius right that could have been invented
3383460	3387460	sitting here tonight and that's one of the things that's so exciting about business models is why
3387460	3393380	we spent time on it last time but then there are also technologies so I would argue multi touch is
3393380	3398820	one of these multi touch was such a game changer because the minute you could use that interface
3398820	3403380	now instead of having to have a dedicated user interface for every single thing you did so remember
3403380	3410740	that example of in the operating theater imagine if you had all the all the instruments that you
3410740	3416340	needed to work with on a one single interface that could change during the operation as you were
3416340	3420900	going through various different stages of it I'm describing a real thing by the way as opposed to
3420900	3425140	you have to go to every single instrument learn that interface and figure out when you go and find
3425140	3429300	you know how to use it no it just flows for you and actually it's monitoring the patient at the
3429300	3433380	real in real time too so you can actually see what you need to spend time on a way you need to focus
3434100	3439220	that's what multi touch did it can save lives it's that critical it's not just for playing games on
3439220	3446500	phones but by the way it's a very big industry too so that's what we want to try to have you find
3446500	3453620	so that's what we mean by disruptive now I'm going to use an example was Amazon a disruption
3453620	3460580	when it first came out no why not because that's what did the same in the UK was the first in the
3460580	3465620	united kingdom who did it commerce my best knowledge okay very good anybody else think it was a
3465620	3472100	not a breakthrough nothing new in the way of products but why is why is the success of Amazon
3472100	3478900	then been so great and by the way I want to hear why you think it wasn't like a breakthrough too
3478900	3483140	I'm just as interested somebody over here I think said it wasn't yeah go ahead Dave well I think
3483140	3491940	Amazon because just of the success in marketing right or just being user friendly you know just
3491940	3496980	getting to the customer because what I what I'm discovering is a lot of these big companies that
3497540	3504500	people kind of like in a way idolized they're just older ideas that other people had before
3505460	3510740	you know that's all it is there's nothing really new but they just happen to blow up
3511940	3516900	and not everyone know their name okay so they became bigger they had more scale
3518020	3524980	they became faster they became better and they became cheaper which is why it's really dangerous
3524980	3531940	to try to compete with them but yet they succeeded so I would argue the reason they succeeded was
3532820	3537220	and there was in Jeff Brazos's quote you all see this this these trucks driving around
3538100	3543700	no other business gave you these two things it wasn't do you want low prices or do you want
3543700	3549300	fast delivery you can have both by the way there was actually a third if you read his quote
3549300	3555140	is to go backwards which was choice and in fact it was how it was how they first got going
3555140	3560100	Amazon succeeded as a bookstore to start off with because you couldn't get access to the
3560100	3564820	long tail of books that people wanted literally physically you couldn't get access you had to
3564820	3569700	go find those books in bookstores and suddenly they said nope we'll find you any book on the
3569700	3574420	isban code or wherever it is in the world that you need to get access to so it was it was first
3574420	3579860	and foremost selection but then when they really focused in it became actually not even selection
3579860	3585700	but fast prices I mean sorry fast delivery and low prices so it is actually a breakthrough
3586500	3591620	it's a breakthrough that they managed to do because they built huge scale and they got the
3591620	3596100	economies of scale to put behind that it's also a fascinating example for another D
3596900	3603220	so that's the disruption they first had it was discontinuous what came next discontinuous is
3603220	3613220	something that you couldn't do before this next thing what is that AWS cloud computing was invented
3613220	3618820	by Amazon and why did they why were they able to invent it because they got such scale in their
3618820	3626820	operations that their compute resources became accessible at a price that was so marginally
3627620	3632740	efficient to sell to other people that now people could start using the cloud as it became known
3632740	3637460	as a basis to build their own business they rented their if you will their hardware infrastructure
3637460	3642820	their storage and their compute to people who wanted to use it and they had such economies of scale
3643300	3646660	that it was actually extremely effective for them to do that we're actually leveraging something
3646660	3651380	that already built the huge data centers etc to do that that story by the way was told right here
3651380	3657300	in this iLab by the guy who got behind it well actually created it Andy Jassy who's a donor to
3657300	3662660	this iLab and it's an interesting story to listen to so it's something that started out as a
3662660	3667380	disruption it became a discontinuous innovation it gave rise to cloud computing anybody here using
3667380	3674020	the cloud i'm sure terror flow must be yeah almost all of you are huge game changer i mean
3674020	3677300	and what's interesting about it and this is where i want you to think about discontinuous
3677300	3683380	things is you couldn't do certain things today without the cloud so pretty much everything we
3683380	3688420	do on our mobile phones couldn't do without the cloud and anything that you're thinking about
3688420	3696260	in terms of for example how we solved this problem of working after covid how would we have done that
3696260	3700660	if we hadn't had the cloud we'd have all disappeared and been unable to communicate and connect and
3700660	3704820	do zoom and all those other things so these are discontinuous innovations that's what those
3704820	3711620	things are about and then finally the third D is how does it become defensible so there are lots
3711620	3718020	of ways things can become defensible here are a few examples you can have great IP that's the
3718020	3723300	typical one some breakthrough innovation so i'm going to guess here that dan you would say something
3723380	3728660	about terror flow is going to be protectable as ip am i right okay and are you going to go
3728660	3736020	after a patent for it perhaps even possibly so if you don't is there some effect that you think
3736020	3741620	you'll have that will cause customers to get to say that hey we will not take terror flow
3742900	3746100	out of our business once we've got working it i've got it working with us
3747780	3753140	will it become part of their end-to-end way that they bring drugs to market for example
3753780	3760020	okay and once it does will they take it away no because it's the way they're used to interpreting
3760020	3764980	the data and communicating internally so that gets to what i call switching costs it's a whole
3764980	3771620	discussion at uh mba level that we talk a lot about once something becomes adopted by your
3771620	3776660	customers and it's proven to be very effective it's really difficult to take it away from them
3777620	3783220	and actually i will say the same keep using the same example if i gave you a brand new
3783780	3790020	spanking you know best in class phone but i told you you had to give up your phone number for it
3790020	3798740	and you had to change carriers for it would you adopt it you would okay most people would say no
3798740	3803860	there's a couple that say yes so it's not an always absolute thing but the point is there
3803860	3808580	are switching costs associated with everything similarly like if i said to you you could go to
3808580	3814020	another university but it doesn't teach your course well of course even if that university is way
3814020	3820260	less expensive and maybe easier to get to it doesn't teach what you need so it's what you're being
3820260	3824740	delivered and how you're being delivered it and how difficult it is to adopt it that is important
3824740	3829460	when you start to think about defensibility so think about network effects think about switching
3829460	3834980	costs think about ip think about things that give your your customer a basis to work with you
3834980	3838580	that causes them to say i wouldn't want to switch i wouldn't want to go anywhere else
3838580	3842500	this is something that i've got used to and then my favorite example of this is follows
3843300	3849380	so if i came up with a much better social network like you loved the way that you could post photos
3849380	3856340	it was way easier but nobody else was on the network would you adopt it of course not nobody
3856340	3861060	to share anything with that's why there's such huge defensibility in the networks that have been
3861060	3867060	built like instagram and whatsapp etc so networks is a very good example of it and then data is a
3867060	3873620	fascinating part of it so vivian's building a an actionable data product for marketers
3874740	3880180	if your data gets broadly used everywhere and more and more marketers contribute to it so it
3880180	3884500	becomes better and better what's your competitive advantage in what's your moat
3886340	3893380	that i am going to be the person who understands the human face the most there you go you will have
3893380	3899460	more data on why people are doing things what it is and by the way what vivian's doing is really
3899460	3904820	fascinating she's giving people the ability to read what it is that users are responding to
3905460	3909940	and if she has better data on that than everybody else guess what that's incredibly powerful for
3909940	3913940	marketers and the more people that use it the more data she'll get the stronger a network
3913940	3920020	effect will be the bigger her moat will be you're nodding but i'm making this up as i go is that
3920020	3928020	true good all right so now it's your turn i want to have each of you take your value prop and tell
3928020	3934660	me what you think could be i'll go back to the 3d's defensible disruptive and also discontinuous
3934660	3938660	about it and let's help you do all do that so i'll walk around and make sure you do it so get
3938660	3946340	your 3d's up and let's get some help for those i'm going to just tell you that everybody's coming
3946340	3954100	up with very good 3d's so first of all i was most surprised by taste of Kenya because consumer
3954100	3961060	products are very difficult to create defensibility with but um Zepora and her team have got a great
3961060	3965780	answer to this and if i get this wrong tell me they've got tenure contracts that they're writing
3965780	3971300	with people which is locking them into a situation sorry go ahead with the farmers
3971300	3975540	which is locking them into a place where other people won't be able to compete as i understand it
3976100	3983860	and then over here i was really excited when i heard a little bit about space health and why is it
3983860	3992580	disruptive it's a new and scary we're always going to be going pretty obvious space in of itself is
3992580	3997540	a whole disruptive industry it like changes the notion that we're actually bound to our planet
3997540	4001700	very disruptive and it's actually becoming an industry because of that and there are a whole
4001700	4006740	bunch of things that are changing because of the fact that we can access space very very interesting
4006740	4010740	i mean we're thinking about all sorts of new industries as a result of that new materials
4010740	4016260	that we might create new forms of for example life that we might explore etc so it's very disruptive
4016260	4022660	okay so i was also very excited when i heard about cohort first thing i heard from them
4022660	4028340	about what's disruptive sorry discontinuous is what used to be an education an analog is now
4028340	4033380	being turned digital by them that's a great example very disruptive things going from analog to
4033380	4040660	digital perfect example of discontent a discontinuity all right then we came to Sharon's new bike seat
4041380	4045140	i was thinking oh bike seat that can't be that you know defensible but then
4045780	4050260	i heard that what she's doing is actually measuring all the data in use while the bike
4050260	4055940	seat is being ridden and the form of the bike seat is changing on the fly as a result of that data
4056980	4063620	now the question that i didn't get to hear is why is it defensible uh defensible ip with the
4063620	4071060	technology and then the other thought was like long-term contracts with bike share companies
4072100	4077700	don't you think your data will become defensible at some point too that as well and it's important
4077700	4083540	because women specifically in a lot of issues but in bike health issues are understudied as well
4083540	4089460	so there's actually not enough data about that right all right so i could keep going around the
4089460	4094660	room but just for time i won't i will encourage you all now to start thinking about instead of
4094660	4099780	talking about better faster cheaper what do you do that's disruptive discontinuous and defensible
4100420	4104100	because that's going to set you up for success and look at all the great ideas you have you've
4104100	4110020	all got a great basis to go defend your business and to to make it really stand out in this breakout
4110020	4116900	way so well done very very exciting okay so we're on to the last leg and this is the piece that
4116900	4122100	hopefully will help you decide whether you've got a business that's worth pursuing and that's how you
4122100	4129540	evaluated so your business or your value proposition needs to be something that is going to last and
4129540	4135140	endure and be sustainable and so there are only a few frameworks here but they're quite important
4135140	4138980	the first one is something i've already been testing with you as we've been going through
4138980	4145220	this evening what was the situation before your product and what is the situation after your product
4146180	4154260	so for argument's sake saline health if people don't get any cure for the challenges they address
4154980	4160020	with going through menopause they're going to be out of work a lot and dysfunctional a lot
4160020	4163460	and they're going to obviously have personal health issues on top of all of that
4163460	4167700	that may lead to other complications in their life so that's pretty clear what the before is
4168260	4174420	the after is what would you say higher productivity among those women
4175300	4181380	they just they just function normal and give back their life that like a high quality of life
4181380	4187460	they should have so literally you could say acute pain or absolute joy and there might be a whole
4187460	4191060	bunch of other things that you might expound on this and i'd encourage you to really go to the
4191060	4195780	absolute extreme if you possibly can't say if their mothers for example that they might be able to
4195780	4200900	look after their families and sustain that their livelihoods as mothers etc or if their
4200900	4204260	workers obviously that they're you know they're they're supporting their community etc there's a
4204260	4208980	lot of things that could could be great if they get their health back whereas if they don't they're
4208980	4214580	dysfunctional in their their situation in life so try to bring those things out the other
4214580	4219860	other thing thing about this is where you get challenged is when you are a consumer product
4219860	4225220	and i i put um taste of kenya up here which is sometimes people will say something is well
4225220	4231220	it's nice to have it's like a vitamin versus you know a morphine so i have a question for you
4231220	4236340	because i know you've got the answer which is why do you think the before and after and in uh
4236340	4244020	you know taste of kenya is so powerful so to the farmers if we don't serve them they're going to
4244020	4249380	cut down their coffee trees so coffee is going to be extinct in kenya uh for the consumers
4252020	4257220	they're never going to have a half to drink ever going to get to drink kenyan coffee okay
4257220	4262100	so it's pretty much a national issue at some level the way you just described it which is great
4262100	4266580	so anyway the before and after we want to make sure that you can say it in a way that this is
4266580	4271940	something that's not a nice to have vitamin but it is really a necessary penicillin or morphine
4271940	4276740	or something that is actually vital to their health now it's not always going to be the case
4276740	4280980	but the more you can define it in those terms which is so critical to people they say okay
4280980	4285220	yeah i've got to have that then the more likely you are to be able to say great i'm on to a good
4285220	4291380	track so just because i'm again going to keep us on time i encourage you to just do this as a
4291380	4296420	t diagram when you're doing your um your value prop just do the before and after and you can do that
4296420	4301620	anytime obviously very easy exercise to do the more you can speak to your customers again back
4301620	4308820	to this whole approach to don't ask this in a vacuum speak to your your user your customer and say
4308820	4312340	tell me all your problems before and remember you want to get them to list those all as long as you
4312340	4316740	can and then if we deliver this for you what will it look like afterwards what will be all the things
4316740	4319940	that you'll be celebrating that you can now do that you couldn't do before whether it's getting
4319940	4324180	your health back or it's whether it's drinking your favorite coffee or whether it's being able to
4324180	4328260	for example get access to the engineering talent that you didn't have before or whether it's making
4328260	4332420	sure your data actually is delivering the right insights that you need as in terribly there are
4332420	4336020	all these things that you'll be able to do and that's critical to put out on your value prop
4336020	4342740	make sense one question how do you actually make sure that that is something you could measure
4344420	4351780	that's what this next framework is so the gain pain ratio is incredibly simple and yet very powerful
4352340	4356820	and what it is is it's measuring the gain you deliver to your customer versus the pain for
4356900	4363620	them to actually adopt what you do now i'm almost certain that all of you could tell me all the
4363620	4368260	gain that you deliver but i'm almost certain that you probably couldn't tell me all the pain
4368900	4374420	and the challenges of adopting it so let's talk talk you through an example so how many of you
4374420	4381940	use venmo great me too became really obvious to me that first of all you know just sending money
4382100	4386580	to pay for basic things and services why on earth would i write a check ever again
4387380	4392340	totally the most dumb thing it's become so convenient it was very easy to use from the
4392340	4399780	minute i started using it however it wasn't always that way and the pain that first went on
4399780	4405060	as venmo got first adopted was it was yet another app for users to use they had to connect it to
4405060	4410420	their bank and they weren't sure whether it was really secure and to start off with not everybody
4410420	4416340	had it so it wasn't really that useful because the network didn't exist and this is sort of the
4416340	4420820	cold start problem that a lot of you might have with your idea so you got to think about all
4420820	4425140	of that and you also got to remember all those things so here's my tip for you which is super
4425140	4431460	easy which is when you go to talk to your customer don't pitch them your idea again ask all the
4431460	4437780	reasons why they have pain but then ask them this one question what are all the reasons you would
4437780	4446660	not buy my product so why would you not buy this product tell me all the reasons and keep asking
4446660	4451140	that question over and over and over again until you get them to tell you all the pain points they
4451140	4456260	would have i can give you a clue about some of them number one is well i don't really need it that
4456260	4461860	badly so guess what i could use the alternative well that's a bad starting point so you're gonna
4461860	4465940	have to figure out you know why and what is it that they don't like about the alternative that
4466020	4470740	actually if you gave them something way better they might use it the second might be cost that's
4470740	4475380	always an easy excuse but then there's other things that are not so obvious like for example
4475380	4481060	training how do i retrain people to use this new approach to doing things or if you're selling a
4481060	4485700	bike seat it might be as basic as well my supply chain is already in place and i don't want to
4485700	4489460	change and disrupt that it's too easy for me to just buy all the component parts i have they're
4489460	4493380	already cheap and you'd slowed all down i've had to design this new bike seat in and get all this
4493380	4498340	new data you know flowing into this new device and that'd be a new complication for me to worry
4498340	4502660	about how is that all going to fit with this thing i sell already very effectively called a bike i'm
4502660	4507780	making it up but it's the kind of thing you want to pull out before you you know end up saying okay
4507780	4513940	i've got my value prop nailed so let's keep going with the venmo example the other thing that's always
4513940	4521060	there is a startup in the middle of this equation is inertia and the risk of you as a startup being
4521060	4526900	something that a customer is going to rely on so do i really need this is one of the things but
4526900	4533380	also what happens if i put my money in this network and this startup fails i just lost
4533380	4537780	whatever money i was sending to people that's a huge risk people don't want to do that unless
4537780	4544340	they feel like oh this is like bank like security so these are things that you have to think about
4544340	4548980	upfront by the way there's some things that you know these products often don't think of initially
4548980	4554340	such as well how can i split the bill and do the tips then we figured that out and eventually
4554340	4560180	they got through that issue so whatever it is that you have assume that there's a reason why people
4560180	4564820	will initially resist you even if it's just that you're a startup and they don't take a risk on you
4564820	4570180	and think about how you'll overcome that so now the question is what's the right ratio
4571060	4574020	of gain to pain before somebody will take a risk on you
4574100	4582500	anybody want to take a guess yep go ahead no pain well that would be awesome so it'd be infinite
4582500	4589700	so your ratio is infinite i love it all right go ahead dan why 10 to 1 because you got to get
4589700	4595780	people over that activation energy yeah to me get excited about your product and make it a priority
4595780	4603060	yeah so what's interesting about bigger faster better sorry cheaper better faster is do you think
4603060	4610420	30 to 90 cheaper is going to cause people to do something to change how might they might use
4611060	4614260	for example their travel and what it caused david's business to take off
4616660	4620340	we're not asking david so we're asking you anybody what does anybody think
4621700	4630340	yes yeah i would say for certain users yeah so why i always say this there are not answers here
4631300	4636180	i would agree with both viewpoints so for certain classes of user for example if you are selling
4636180	4639860	to a pharma company and they're you know doing experimentation i would say 10 to 1 is probably
4639860	4644580	right because it's very expensive for them to go change their workflows to develop new drugs
4644580	4650500	but for a consumer if you're going to offer a 30 to 90 cheaper solution david might really
4650500	4654580	be onto something i would want to you know save that money maybe even 10 percent would be enough
4654660	4660900	for the threshold maybe not maybe 20 maybe anyway you get my point you've got to measure this
4660900	4665220	and you've got to ask your user and you've got to be clear what's the threshold view on the gain
4665220	4669700	pain ratio where you would make a change that would make you take the risk and get over the inertia
4669700	4675940	that's why this is such a useful formula can i ask a question about that example um because i feel
4675940	4681460	like there's the pain of maybe like switching platforms you normally use to look for travel but
4681460	4689300	it strikes me that with that particular example there's another pain of changing the way you travel
4690260	4696340	because you're not putting in a destination so i'm wondering how you think about those two because
4696340	4702100	one seems like more a longer term shift that you're trying to prompt so i'm going to let you and
4702100	4707940	david debate that afterwards but because it's it's specific to him the principle though is still the
4707940	4713460	same which is what you're asking david to do is say david why would i take this risk and why would
4713460	4719140	i use your service versus what i'm already doing and i'll give you an answer that i think is important
4719140	4724100	to sort of use in a general sense so that it's not about david's business which is if the customer
4724100	4728180	has something that they're comfortable with and you really are not giving them at least an order of
4728180	4732900	magnitude improvement in something or a significant gain in something they're not going to do anything
4732900	4737380	life's too short they're too busy they'd rather just carry on doing whatever they're doing the greatest
4737380	4741780	inertia and the greatest reason that people fail is because they're not solving a valuable
4741780	4745940	enough problem that where the gain pain ratio is big enough that somebody will make a change
4746580	4751140	or that'll adopt something and it can be on either side of this equation too by the way
4751140	4754740	for example let's use an example a case in point that we've all experienced which is
4754740	4761060	it's incredibly easy to download an app it's point click download the app so that pain if you
4761060	4765780	will of trying something is incredibly low but then if you start using it and it's no good it's
4765780	4772420	also incredibly easy to just point click delete so you've got to find something that is really
4772420	4778740	valuable on a sustainable basis for somebody and ideally make it so easy for them to adopt it that
4778740	4783780	it's going to be a very successful go-to-market motion for you when you start selling it and
4783780	4787860	that's what this pain gain ratio is all about so by the way venmo did some very clever things they
4787860	4792980	added all these security measures they made sign up so easy for example you could just scan a qr code
4792980	4799540	to pay in certain situations and there are a whole set of things that became obviously so simple
4799540	4804980	that we've all adopted it and it's now friction-free and because the network's there we talked about
4804980	4810660	that too it's obviously got huge defensibility because nobody else is going to just disrupt that
4811220	4815460	because all the people that you already pay on venmo it's just one click for you to pay them
4816500	4822100	obvious stuff right so let me make sure that you get a clear idea of what are the things to
4822100	4827700	look for on gain pain so first of all on the gain is pretty obvious you know how much money do you
4827700	4830820	make people how much time do you save them all that stuff you're going to you're going to nail
4830820	4837860	that I know that's not the problem on the pain side don't forget how you are going to have to help
4837860	4844740	people find you try you buy you adopt you get trained into your system and everything else
4844740	4851140	that's associated with owning you all of that is pain all of that has to be factored into your gain
4851140	4856260	pain ratio and in the middle don't forget all these things that are associated with what ultimately
4856260	4861060	come down to risk and are inertia for people to change anything if you do that you have the basis
4861060	4865380	to evaluate your value prop and you're in the power seat at that point because you can keep telling
4865380	4870900	yourself your thing's great but until you see that tipping and customers are pulling you to market
4870900	4874900	and saying yep this is really something I've got to adopt you know you haven't got it right
4875860	4882900	so uh teraflow was easy for me to to pick down I would say you have work to do on your your gain
4882900	4889940	plane because the way you expressed your value prop is very clear like for you know translational
4889940	4895060	scientists and we know the who is for with traditional r package you know ours of those of you
4895060	4901540	don't know hugely widely adopted language that's used for statisticians um due to you haven't quite
4901620	4905860	got the unmet needs yet so that's great you probably can figure that out I might say based
4905860	4911220	on what I've learned the inability to gain the insights necessary to define the data data path
4911220	4917060	for them uh teraflow offers the platform but allows scientists to extract clinical breakthroughs
4917060	4921380	now you're going to have to decide how will you declare that as at least an order of magnitude
4921380	4926260	since that's the term you came up with better than the alternative of doing nothing because
4926260	4933540	otherwise they will do nothing make sense okay good so I will just simply say we got to the end
4933540	4938260	naturally otherwise which is you already know where we're headed I already told you what the
4938260	4942580	value prop is I gave you the statement up front now what I'm going to just just put it all together
4942580	4948420	for you which is this value prop statement is actually built by all the frameworks we just took
4948420	4956900	you through and again this is in the workbook so the four piece defining who it is for use this
4956900	4961620	minimum viable segment again that's in your workbook I drew it very briefly here and talked about
4962180	4967620	how do you find the same needs that you can address with your first product don't get pulled
4967620	4971620	all over the place find a set of users for whom you have the same needs your minimum viable segment
4972260	4978340	check that they are blatant and critical needs ideally rather than latent and aspirational
4978340	4982740	that's the black and white framework or if they start latent and aspirational be clear how you're
4982740	4988020	going to get them the question that Victor asked from just using something that was just a basic
4988020	4992180	platform a basic product like an iPad to a place where it becomes mission critical
4993700	4999780	and then how do you define what's urgent and underserved and unworkable etc that's the four
4999860	5004820	use if your audience tells you that if your customer tells you that then you know you're
5004820	5007620	dealing with the right customer and you've identified the right pain points for them
5008340	5011940	same with what are they dissatisfied with things that are unworkable
5012740	5018020	if they really are unworkable they're not going to put up with it and if they're underserved in
5018020	5022340	other words they're not being able to get for example the coffee they need or for example the
5022340	5027620	comfort they need or the travel access they need or the safety they need or the health they need
5027620	5032740	etc then spell it out that's where it'll go in your value problem and then don't just say it's
5032740	5037940	faster better cheaper tell people why it's disruptive and it's a discontinuous innovation
5037940	5043780	it's gone digital as opposed to used to be analog or it's now online and accessible and then
5044500	5049540	it provides something which you want to make sure they are very clear is an order of magnitude
5049540	5055540	breakthrough and that's where you use the gain-prane ratio you don't just say it's x you say it's
5055540	5062500	10x and here's why because for you to adopt it even with the pain of you know retraining etc
5062500	5068180	you're going to get this enormous gain that is compelling and then finally it's unlike the
5068180	5073140	things that at the moment are also unworkable for one reason or another or are not addressing your
5073140	5080340	need or underserved it's your value problem so with that we're finishing one minute early now
5081300	5082980	any questions before we wrap up
5084980	5088820	yeah go ahead Sappora could you please walk us through the black again
5090580	5096420	so a lot of products might start out as being something that in this framework
5098660	5108100	latent and aspirational in other words people would like to have this is a nice to have
5111220	5114740	but really where you want to get to is a place where it's blatant
5117860	5118580	and critical
5122100	5127460	so this is a must-have so i don't need to tell any of you this but
5128180	5135220	all the things that are subsistence for you are must-haves food water health anything that
5135220	5141540	enables you to do your job they're all must-haves all the things down here like well depending
5141540	5147700	on the thing you like but you know what you spend your money on is your business but entertainment
5147700	5152820	might be a nice to have in certain circumstances compared to health pretty obvious to state that
5152820	5161700	or fashion might be a nice to have versus comfort i mean versus you know it's winter in boston so
5162580	5167380	things that protect you from the cold i mean there's just basic ways to define things that
5167380	5172500	are nice to have versus must-haves the more you can understand how you move from the nice tab to
5172500	5178180	the must have the better does that make sense great okay so i'll let you come up and ask any
5178180	5182500	questions you like but i want to finish now on time so thank you very much for for joining in on
5182500	5188100	this i will say that the most important thing in all of this is that it's built around you so if
5188100	5192500	you don't uniquely understand the problem you're addressing then why are you doing it
5192500	5196740	because you're going to face a lot of competition from people who do know better than you then which
5196740	5201860	case what can your solution deliver uniquely well is what we've been spending all this time on
5201860	5207060	based on what you know that also can be built around you and finally if you can bring that
5207060	5210980	all together around what we talked about last time around a disruptive business model then it's
5210980	5216660	going to be sustainable and so this is oftentimes what people refer to as founder market fit it's
5216660	5222500	why you are uniquely in a position to solve this particular value prop and and do it in a way that
5222500	5228340	is sustainable with a business model that we talked about last week so in summary have fun defining
5228340	5233300	it have fun evaluating it and make sure it's built around you and you'll have a great company thanks
5233300	5245940	very much it's been a pleasure
