0	7000	Welcome! You have learned that for some ordinary differential equations you can determine equilibrium solutions.
7000	10000	But can we say more about these equilibrium solutions?
10000	12000	Yes, you can!
12000	19000	In this video you will learn about the stability of equilibrium solutions of autonomous differential equations.
19000	25000	Consider the following differential equation for some population of rainbowfish p.
25000	36000	If you set the rate of change of the population p to zero and solve for p, you obtain one equilibrium solution p equals approximately 28.6.
36000	43000	To analyze this equilibrium point further, you can use the direction field of the differential equation.
43000	47000	The direction field for this differential equation is shown here.
47000	52000	For clarity, I have also added the curve of the equilibrium solution in black.
52000	62000	So now let us take an initial population of 25 fish, so p at time zero equals 25, and sketch the solution curve in green.
62000	67000	As you can see, if time increases, the green curve goes down quickly.
67000	75000	If you sketch one more solution curve with an initial value of p between zero and the equilibrium, you get this graph.
75000	80000	This curve also goes quickly away from 28.6.
80000	85000	Now what would happen if you take a larger initial value, for example 30?
85000	90000	As you can see, the yellow curve goes away from the equilibrium as time increases.
90000	97000	If I sketch the solution curve for the initial value of 35, I get this second yellow curve.
97000	101000	Again, this curve goes away from the equilibrium as time increases.
101000	107000	You can continue to sketch some solution curve which should give you a graph like this.
108000	112000	Adding even more solution curves gives you this graph.
112000	117000	Looking at this graph, you see two regions in which the solution curves behave differently.
117000	127000	If the initial value is below the equilibrium, the solution curve moves away from the equilibrium and towards minus infinity as time increases.
127000	135000	And if the initial value is above the equilibrium, the solution curve moves away from the equilibrium and tends to infinity as time increases.
135000	140000	This is a lot to say, so maybe we can summarize this in a new type of graph.
140000	151000	Because you know only the initial value determines how the solution curve behaves, you could make a graph which only contains values of the dependent variable p.
151000	160000	Our previous conclusion shows that the important value is 28.6, so let us draw a vertical line containing this value indicated by the point.
160000	167000	If you would have an initial value smaller than 28.6, we concluded previously that the value would decrease.
167000	174000	You can indicate this in this graph by drawing an arrowhead on the line pointing away from 28.6.
174000	180000	In a similar fashion, you can draw an arrowhead above the equilibrium which points upwards,
180000	186000	because any initial value larger than 28.6 will give a solution curve that tends to infinity.
187000	193000	This graph is what is called a phase line of the ordinary differential equation.
193000	199000	Now let us take a closer look at the phase line and the population of 28.6 rainbowfish.
199000	204000	This point has above and below two arrows pointing away from 28.6.
204000	212000	This means that if you have a smaller or larger population, your solution curves would move away from this value.
212000	219000	The value of 28.6 fish is what is called an unstable equilibrium point of the differential equation.
219000	227000	In a phase line, an unstable equilibrium point is always surrounded by two arrows pointing away from the equilibrium point.
227000	234000	So you now have found that the population of 28.6 rainbowfish is unstable.
234000	240000	Of course, other types of equilibrium exist, but these you will encounter in a different part of this course.
240000	246000	In the next exercises, you will construct a phase line yourself and classify the equilibrium points.
