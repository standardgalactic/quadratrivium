00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Welcome! You have learned that for some ordinary differential equations you can determine equilibrium solutions.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
But can we say more about these equilibrium solutions?

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Yes, you can!

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:19,000
In this video you will learn about the stability of equilibrium solutions of autonomous differential equations.

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Consider the following differential equation for some population of rainbowfish p.

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:36,000
If you set the rate of change of the population p to zero and solve for p, you obtain one equilibrium solution p equals approximately 28.6.

7
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:43,000
To analyze this equilibrium point further, you can use the direction field of the differential equation.

8
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:47,000
The direction field for this differential equation is shown here.

9
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:52,000
For clarity, I have also added the curve of the equilibrium solution in black.

10
00:00:52,000 --> 00:01:02,000
So now let us take an initial population of 25 fish, so p at time zero equals 25, and sketch the solution curve in green.

11
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:07,000
As you can see, if time increases, the green curve goes down quickly.

12
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:15,000
If you sketch one more solution curve with an initial value of p between zero and the equilibrium, you get this graph.

13
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:20,000
This curve also goes quickly away from 28.6.

14
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Now what would happen if you take a larger initial value, for example 30?

15
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:30,000
As you can see, the yellow curve goes away from the equilibrium as time increases.

16
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:37,000
If I sketch the solution curve for the initial value of 35, I get this second yellow curve.

17
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Again, this curve goes away from the equilibrium as time increases.

18
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:47,000
You can continue to sketch some solution curve which should give you a graph like this.

19
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Adding even more solution curves gives you this graph.

20
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Looking at this graph, you see two regions in which the solution curves behave differently.

21
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:07,000
If the initial value is below the equilibrium, the solution curve moves away from the equilibrium and towards minus infinity as time increases.

22
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:15,000
And if the initial value is above the equilibrium, the solution curve moves away from the equilibrium and tends to infinity as time increases.

23
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:20,000
This is a lot to say, so maybe we can summarize this in a new type of graph.

24
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Because you know only the initial value determines how the solution curve behaves, you could make a graph which only contains values of the dependent variable p.

25
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Our previous conclusion shows that the important value is 28.6, so let us draw a vertical line containing this value indicated by the point.

26
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:47,000
If you would have an initial value smaller than 28.6, we concluded previously that the value would decrease.

27
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:54,000
You can indicate this in this graph by drawing an arrowhead on the line pointing away from 28.6.

28
00:02:54,000 --> 00:03:00,000
In a similar fashion, you can draw an arrowhead above the equilibrium which points upwards,

29
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:06,000
because any initial value larger than 28.6 will give a solution curve that tends to infinity.

30
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:13,000
This graph is what is called a phase line of the ordinary differential equation.

31
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Now let us take a closer look at the phase line and the population of 28.6 rainbowfish.

32
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:24,000
This point has above and below two arrows pointing away from 28.6.

33
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:32,000
This means that if you have a smaller or larger population, your solution curves would move away from this value.

34
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:39,000
The value of 28.6 fish is what is called an unstable equilibrium point of the differential equation.

35
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:47,000
In a phase line, an unstable equilibrium point is always surrounded by two arrows pointing away from the equilibrium point.

36
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:54,000
So you now have found that the population of 28.6 rainbowfish is unstable.

37
00:03:54,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Of course, other types of equilibrium exist, but these you will encounter in a different part of this course.

38
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:06,000
In the next exercises, you will construct a phase line yourself and classify the equilibrium points.
