Welcome! You have learned that for some ordinary differential equations you can determine equilibrium solutions.

00:07.000 --> 00:10.000
But can we say more about these equilibrium solutions?

00:10.000 --> 00:12.000
Yes, you can!

00:12.000 --> 00:19.000
In this video you will learn about the stability of equilibrium solutions of autonomous differential equations.

00:19.000 --> 00:25.000
Consider the following differential equation for some population of rainbowfish p.

00:25.000 --> 00:36.000
If you set the rate of change of the population p to zero and solve for p, you obtain one equilibrium solution p equals approximately 28.6.

00:36.000 --> 00:43.000
To analyze this equilibrium point further, you can use the direction field of the differential equation.

00:43.000 --> 00:47.000
The direction field for this differential equation is shown here.

00:47.000 --> 00:52.000
For clarity, I have also added the curve of the equilibrium solution in black.

00:52.000 --> 01:02.000
So now let us take an initial population of 25 fish, so p at time zero equals 25, and sketch the solution curve in green.

01:02.000 --> 01:07.000
As you can see, if time increases, the green curve goes down quickly.

01:07.000 --> 01:15.000
If you sketch one more solution curve with an initial value of p between zero and the equilibrium, you get this graph.

01:15.000 --> 01:20.000
This curve also goes quickly away from 28.6.

01:20.000 --> 01:25.000
Now what would happen if you take a larger initial value, for example 30?

01:25.000 --> 01:30.000
As you can see, the yellow curve goes away from the equilibrium as time increases.

01:30.000 --> 01:37.000
If I sketch the solution curve for the initial value of 35, I get this second yellow curve.

01:37.000 --> 01:41.000
Again, this curve goes away from the equilibrium as time increases.

01:41.000 --> 01:47.000
You can continue to sketch some solution curve which should give you a graph like this.

01:48.000 --> 01:52.000
Adding even more solution curves gives you this graph.

01:52.000 --> 01:57.000
Looking at this graph, you see two regions in which the solution curves behave differently.

01:57.000 --> 02:07.000
If the initial value is below the equilibrium, the solution curve moves away from the equilibrium and towards minus infinity as time increases.

02:07.000 --> 02:15.000
And if the initial value is above the equilibrium, the solution curve moves away from the equilibrium and tends to infinity as time increases.

02:15.000 --> 02:20.000
This is a lot to say, so maybe we can summarize this in a new type of graph.

02:20.000 --> 02:31.000
Because you know only the initial value determines how the solution curve behaves, you could make a graph which only contains values of the dependent variable p.

02:31.000 --> 02:40.000
Our previous conclusion shows that the important value is 28.6, so let us draw a vertical line containing this value indicated by the point.

02:40.000 --> 02:47.000
If you would have an initial value smaller than 28.6, we concluded previously that the value would decrease.

02:47.000 --> 02:54.000
You can indicate this in this graph by drawing an arrowhead on the line pointing away from 28.6.

02:54.000 --> 03:00.000
In a similar fashion, you can draw an arrowhead above the equilibrium which points upwards,

03:00.000 --> 03:06.000
because any initial value larger than 28.6 will give a solution curve that tends to infinity.

03:07.000 --> 03:13.000
This graph is what is called a phase line of the ordinary differential equation.

03:13.000 --> 03:19.000
Now let us take a closer look at the phase line and the population of 28.6 rainbowfish.

03:19.000 --> 03:24.000
This point has above and below two arrows pointing away from 28.6.

03:24.000 --> 03:32.000
This means that if you have a smaller or larger population, your solution curves would move away from this value.

03:32.000 --> 03:39.000
The value of 28.6 fish is what is called an unstable equilibrium point of the differential equation.

03:39.000 --> 03:47.000
In a phase line, an unstable equilibrium point is always surrounded by two arrows pointing away from the equilibrium point.

03:47.000 --> 03:54.000
So you now have found that the population of 28.6 rainbowfish is unstable.

03:54.000 --> 04:00.000
Of course, other types of equilibrium exist, but these you will encounter in a different part of this course.

04:00.000 --> 04:06.000
In the next exercises, you will construct a phase line yourself and classify the equilibrium points.
