{"text": " Welcome back everybody. We're really glad to see you all here today and to those people online as well I'm still Jillian Hadfield And still director and chair nobody's taken me out yet of the Schwartz-Riesman Institute Looking really forward to these sessions today new questions and challenges and Lots of lots of wonderful lots of wonderful sessions Let's see is there anything else you want to make sure I say before we get started No, okay, I think we're gonna get we're just gonna move into our first session which is which I think Yeah, I'll stay up here to do the intro. So this first session is on the reward hypothesis which we got some mention of yesterday and And Will we're interested in this I think rich will give us who is the the source of the word hypothesis posited 20 years ago that Maybe rich you're gonna say this but let me for just summarize it here for that all we mean by goals and purposes can be well thought of as maximization of the expected value of the cumulative sum of a scalar Receive scalar signal or reward So the question that we're gonna be discussing is then is this a good model of Reinforcement learning is a good model for understanding human behavior and values. How far can it go? Can it guide normative decision-making for individuals and groups? and Totally delighted to have with us on this on this panel Rich Sutton who I neglected to actually Introduce yesterday when we started our session with blaze. So my apologies for that because he is world-class research Researcher and reinforcement learning as well as chief scientific advisor fellow in Canada CIFAR AI chair at Amy the Alberta machine intelligence Institute He's a professor of computing science at the University of Alberta and a distinguished research scientist at DeepMind He's been named a fellow of the Royal Society of Canada the Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence and the Canadian Artificial Intelligence Association where he received a lifetime Achievement award in 2018 and as I mentioned yesterday, we're also very delighted He's on our advisory board at Schwartz-Reisman and joining rich today is Julia Haas Senior research scientist in the ethics research team at DeepMind She was previously an assistant professor in philosophy and neuroscience at Rhodes College and an affiliated researcher with and use humanizing machine intelligence grand challenge her research is in the philosophy of Cognitive science and neuroscience. She works on the nature evaluation and its roles and theories of the mind Your current work includes investigating the possibility of meaningful moral artificial Intelligence and I will also mention that Julia is this is a return trip to absolutely interdisciplinary for Julia Which we're also very grateful. It's wonderful to have people saying yes to those invitations But our previous one of course was online, so it's wonderful to have you here in person Julia And so rich, I think you're gonna get us started Thanks very much Thank you, Jillian Good to see y'all again. Let's try to have some more fun today My topic is Roughly the reward hypothesis, but the reward and other related Reductionist hypotheses because the reward hypothesis is pretty reductionists And I do have a slide just stating all so you can all see it All of what we mean by goals and purposes can be well thought of as the maximization With expected value of the cumulative sum of a received a scalar signal called reward so That's kind of a long sentence Sounds like it's got lots of little bits that that are intricate but But really it just says that maybe the goals of Whenever you want to talk about goals, maybe you can just talk about maximizing a single number and That is pretty reductionist and I'll be talking about that a little bit, but I don't want to start there I want to start by going back a bit. So this is my outline. I want to talk about intelligence and To what degree it's intrinsically tied up with the notion of a goal Which of course is the reward hypothesis is about And then we'll step into the reward hypothesis fully And then I also want to talk about you know What goes on inside because the reward hypothesis is not about what goes on inside the reward hypothesis like how you how? What's an appropriate framing of the problem? What's the appropriate framing of of a goal or a purpose? And it's not about how that purpose is achieved Okay, but that's what the agent the agent is the intelligent agent like we are the agents and the robots are the agents and what are the essential for What are they literally essential components, you know, that's That's something I want to talk about that. So and then and then some other hypotheses the value function hypothesis is really important to understand the implications of the reward hypothesis and then I'll have just really just want to slide we're Prepare us to start to think about how this might have implications for thinking about ethics Okay, so let's start with intelligence and Here's some quotes William James was the like the original psychologist His textbook was in 1890 and he spoke about Well, he didn't spoke about intelligence he spoke about mind So the hallmark of mind is attaining consistent ends by variable means What do you think about that? That's really talking about a goal right consistent ends from variable means something is varying its means in order to Achieve those consistent ends. That's really saying the hallmark of mind is goal-seeking And then there's the field of artificial intelligence which is Famous for not defining what intelligence is or what artificial intelligence is Yeah, for so long it just refused to do it and you know, I think that's not okay You have to everyone have a well-defined field. You have to have be clear about what your objectives are and what your subject is John McCarthy is the fellow who Invented the term artificial intelligence. He of course is one of the founding fathers But many years later He wrote down a specific Definition that's the one here that I that I like as the computational part of the ability to achieve goals The computational part the ability to achieve goals. I think that's a really interesting definition It's not the only definition Often intelligence is taken to be like mimicking people as in AI Seeks to reproduce behavior that we would call intelligent if it was done by people The classic Turing test is focusing on behaving like a person supervised learning the task is often to label Pictures say the same as a person would label those pictures and then the large language models, of course the large language models are all about mimicking Text generation by people Okay, so this is this is a major thing You notice aren't really any goals involved in mimicking people except, you know You could say mimicking people as a goal But really that's not what what I think goals are about goals are about affecting some change in the world Observing something and then you're being satisfied that you're mimicking it is not about a change in the world But you know think of all those systems That are mimicking there. They're not seeking to change their input at all. They're just seeking to mimic it Okay, anyway, so there's two definitions one is that intelligence is has to do with mimicking people and The other one is achieving goals and we might ask which is better and I want you to think about that and so I don't want to think about it with a little bit of sophistication Maybe this is kind of like yesterday, you know, I don't want us to jump to an answer because I want to think about what it means for there to be an answer and You don't really have any slides on this, but I do have this slide That just reminds us that you know a word like intelligence when you look in the dictionary you will find multiple definitions The second one being a military intelligence like spies and stuff So every word is like this and that's the way language is and it's it's good it's good that there are multiple definitions and multiple meanings for words and There so there isn't a sense that one is right or wrong. There's There's a sense in which they're useful for or not useful for particular purposes So it's our we have there's a free choice when you define a term. It's a totally free choice There's no right and there's no wrong in the in the definition of a word but there is Consequences right because you're you're choosing how to use it And so then you have to use it that way and you can decide whether for your purpose That's a useful way to define the term So the to the extent there is a right or wrong is just it's not it's it's a sense whether they're useful suited to purpose so Now let's go on and try to Assess the different meanings and I want to do that by reference to this quote from Ray Kurzweil He says that intelligence is the most powerful phenomenon in the universe So that's not a definition obviously it's it's like a property of what intelligence means something and then and then it's claiming that it's powerful But Just take it on his face for a moment Could intelligence be the most powerful phenomenon in the universe? I mean, what about you know black holes and supernova supernova very powerful But I think Ray means this literally and I think it's not crazy to mean this literally like you know supernova Are big but isn't it it's Isn't it also plausible that Well supernova have been around for billions of years. They've had billions of years to develop intelligence has been around for Few hundreds of thousands of years If you give give intelligence, you know a billion years Is it is it doesn't seem almost likely that? Intelligence if it if it still exists would would be doing things like moving the stars around moving the planets It would be a powerful phenomenon in the universe at that scale. I think it's It sort of expresses the ambition of what we want intelligence to be Okay, so So when when I suggested to you that it might Become a big deal and in a universal galaxy level What what I was thinking was could the fact that there are Agents in the world that have goals And it's best to think of them that way Could it be that powerful phenomenon eventually and that's what I want to say yes to For the other meaning could the ability to mimic people be such a powerful phenomenon I'm I think I think the answer is just no People are the powerful thing and so mimicking the thing that mimic will gain some power from the people But the the ability to mimic people is not powerful in this sense so That's my first conclusion that the powerful part of intelligence is not the ability to mimic people but the ability to achieve goals and so That's a point in favor of using the word in this way the ability to achieve goals Okay, now Let's look a little bit deeper into McCarthy's definition You define as the computational part of the ability to achieve goals So that computational part is meant to rule out like you I can achieve goals because I'm stronger as I'm faster And I have better sensors These would make you better able to achieve many goals, but it would not be because of your computations So we don't consider that to be intelligence There are at least that definition doesn't So moving that up a little bit to give myself give myself a little more room I think similarly You could achieve goals better if you're given knowledge about The world or the domain you were working in you know that would enable you to perform better to achieve goals better But it's not again. It's not because of your computations It's not your intelligence is because of the computations of where we gave you that knowledge gave you that help so I guess I have a conclusion out of that that I Want to say the intelligence is the computational and domain independent part of the ability to achieve goals maybe that's a refinement or a narrowing of McCarthy's definition, but I think it's in the spirit of Having a powerful phenomenon of Intel for intelligence being a powerful phenomenon Okay, so just to summarize that Mimicry and domain knowledge are not the powerful part of intelligence Mimicry is getting goal directed behavior without the goals or the processes that compute the behavior from the goals Injecting domain knowledge is a way of getting gold directed behavior without the processes for obtaining the domain knowledge So this is sort of the way I understand The limitations of large language models. They are the abilities But they were given to them and they don't have the ability to To develop that knowledge and that behavior themselves So they're they're both incomplete can't stand on their own These shortcuts don't have the power of intelligence. They can be very useful but but That shouldn't make them intelligence Using in the word in that way would weaken the search for an understanding of intelligence. That's powerful in Kurzweil sense Let me just say another another thing on that which is that intelligence the word intelligence AI AI in particular in today's world has cash a like Actually, it's not even just today's world. It's always been this way but What I mean is like for example, I went to the grocery store the drugstore the other day and I saw the aisle full of electric toothbrushes and You go to the electric toothbrush section today and they will say this toothbrush has AI in it. I Mean literally they will say that It has cash a to have AI to have intelligence is as viewed as a very positive thing And so everyone wants to be that way I hear that LG has a has a clothes washer that's has AI in it In the old days they used to make computer terminals and They would call the terminals intelligent terminals and all they would do they were only intelligent because they could use multiple fonts You know, so this has always been the case And so there's a tendency for everything to become AI More's law or the generalized Moore's law of increasing Computation per dollar that's gone on for a hundred years or more That is all about increasing computation. It's not about increasing not not it's not necessarily about increasing AI So there's a big there's a tendency to conflate the two trends that AI is becoming more important and Computation is becoming more plentiful. So all everywhere there's computation And that's that's what we're seeing with this Stretching of the term intelligence to cover everything That just uses computation. I don't think that's a useful direction to stretch the term Okay, I think now I'm ready for a joke and so I'm gonna I think I'm ready now to present my present my my joke Or my cartoon. This is my cartoon. You may have seen it To think that this all began with letting autocomplete finish our sentences So this I found this in the New York. I hope I'm not violating important copyright things anyway I'd like I really like this cartoon because it's It's exaggerated. It's making both fun making fun of Both the positive and the negative hype that's around AI The the positive the positive hype is that autocomplete finishing our senses will lead to you know, the robots being super powerful and taking over and Guess the negative hype is that you know if if Computers become powerful if we should robots become powerful they will subject us all to slavery as in as in this picture Okay, so humor is the best way to purify or our thoughts and and Think about controversial things Okay, so now I'm ready to talk more specifically about the reward hypothesis, but I hope you You've gotten the point the point, you know the word hypothesis about how we talk about purposes and goals and Intelligence is is really centrally about goals and purposes so if this is true if it's true that all goals and purposes can be thought of as as Maximizing a single number in this way, then it means that all of intelligence can be thought of as maximizing a simple number So this is one the multiple ways to develop this hypothesis one is to do it mathematically and formally and and Like you know, what's this? What does it mean to have a have a goal? It's an ordering on possible outcomes and what are they all possible different ways of doing an ordering and you're looking at this Carefully as a mathematical formal statement Like one might in do in economics or the theory of decision-making So that's that's the work this idea has been developed in that direction I'm and I'm referring to the work in the corner It's more recent work by Michael bowling and John Martin David Abel and Will Dabney where they formally assess it to the extent that it is Complete and includes anything else you might propose. So what are the other things that are ruled out? You may be thinking, you know What's ruled out would be things like considerations of risk in a special way consideration of multiple objectives You see it's all about the expected value rather than the distribution of possibilities Okay, now another another hypothesis that's been around The reward is enough hypothesis That there's intelligence and all of its associated abilities can be understood as subserving the maximization of reward So this is very similar. It's almost like the combination of the reward hypothesis and the McCarthy's definition of intelligence But notice all these things are about the goals are about the the problem the problem They're not at all talking about solution methods. They're just saying Reward might be enough to motivate and drive the achieving the achievement of the associated abilities, whatever they may be You can understand them as as being driven or subserving the maximization of reward Okay, so now I want to Is reward enough is a single number enough? It doesn't it's it's it's it doesn't seem like enough. I just wanted to Bring this on the table. I'm sure you felt that it seems too small a single number coming from outside the agent You know people seem to choose their own goals. I mean, that's one of the biggest things we see for ourselves We define ourselves by the goals we set out to achieve Reward just seems too small too reductive. It's definitely reductionist hypothesis. It's and as reduct being reductive It's kind of demeaning Surely our goals are grander than maximizing, you know pleasure and pain or some number You know, we have things like raising a family saving the planet making the world a better place contributing to human knowledge Not just these small things so So that's really the tension. I think around the reward hypothesis that it seems like it seems too small and yet it seems We keep being driven back to it as we try to get formal as we try to be clear about goals we're We're driven back to it because it's clear because it's experiential Kind of grounds things it gives us a well-defined place to proceed so now a few slides exemplifying how Even though we're uneasy with this idea we keep coming back to it we what is we I mean, it's an interdisciplinary idea This is the modern view about About how our brains work is that there is there is a measure of Pleasure and pain and then There are calculations. I'll get into a little bit later But it's totally consistent with this and not just we it's like all animals have like a dopamine center and This is a good it has been true that a good way to think about them has been in terms of a scalar outcome Not entirely Okay, so let me go through some facts This is some of these slides a little more detailed than we need But I just want to refer that within AI which is also uneasy with the idea of reward It's it's become more comfortable with it over time So the very earliest AI systems were all formulated their goals as Attain the state of the world Okay, which is which is very different from Maximizes number coming into your into your mind It's as if we can access directly the states of the world which which we cannot of course we have to infer them from our from our sensations but And and I'm saying it's even true the latest version of the standard AI textbook Russell Norvig it still talks about goals primarily in terms of states of the world and not in terms of experience not in terms of reward But it also has chapters on reinforcement learning and those those all use reward and With the rise of machine learning within AI the reward formulation has becoming more and more standard as in planning and mark-up decision processes and We can look at Yanlacoon Yanlacoon who was who's sort of an anti Reinforcement learning person he now admits that if the if the mind is a cake This is his metaphor Is that if the mind is a cake then reinforcement learning is a tiny part of it's like the cherry on top but he thinks the reinforcement learning acknowledges that reinforced learning is necessary because goals are necessary and Either the substance of the of the cake is maybe doing prediction or unsupervised learning and so it those parts are not Goal oriented. They're just trying to predict and understand the world And I shouldn't say just they're trying to predict and they're trying to understand the world and model the world those don't Don't have goals in them. They're just I said it again just gotta watch out for that little word just they are Understanding the the truth of the world as separate from Trying to direct that in any particular way Okay, but anyway, he's got the cherry on the top and to me. It's a cherry on the top of the cake. So it's pretty important and Here's another one from classic AI artificial intelligence There's this these cognitive architectures since the 80s They're very symbolic and using production rules and since like 2008 and they've included reward as part of it as as a as a basis for The the goals of the system So single numbers have becoming more prominent in AI as a formulation of the goal now this now let's talk more in a more interdisciplinary sense and I recently wrote a little paper where I just sort of said, oh, you know There's a lot of commonality between many many fields thinking about Agenthood and goals and purposes in mind, you know in psychology control theory AI economics neuroscience operations research at least these six You can find basically the elements In these two pictures the first picture is the agent interacting with the world or the environment and So this is the basic picture of a of a decision maker. He Sees information from the world his observations and he picks actions and then he gets back a Scalar measure of performance that he with the objective is to maximize it. That's sort of accepting the reward framework You will find this Of course these ideas very basic, but even when you look inside the agent now So I'm gonna look inside the agent how the problem is solved you can find some of the common elements and So there are four of them But let's talk first about the core two So I'm gonna block some of these out. Yeah, the core two is the perception and The policy the reactive policy so perception Takes in observation so observations are like, you know, your sensory input and From that you construct a sense of where you are. That's that's the state representation And then you choose what to do based upon the state representation The difference between the two boxes is that the policy is Memoryless right you can't use old states to decide what you're gonna do now the whole point of a stage as it says This is where I am now this I should decide what to do based on where I am now it's And it's the job of perception to construct that sense of where you are now So perception is recurrent it involves the last thing you did the last observation and the the previous state Now This is a complete behaving system Observation comes in flows through perception and the policy produced in action That's all you need to be a complete behaving system and you notice reward is kind of hanging out there It's not really doing anything and that's because This is a complete behaving system, but not a system that's made up for changing what that system does So let me dig do one more dig at large language models. They are this part, you know they are a way of transforming the sequence of words into a Memory of where you are and then deciding which word to output But it's not a way of changing that the there isn't a once your large language model is in place is running in the world It can't change. It's it's just these two parts now You can change in the sense that perception can accumulate your a More refined state as you get more observations, but you can't get a change in the policy for example or or a change in the Function that is implemented as perception Maybe I'll dwell on this a little bit more and then on the interdisciplinary aspect So we see just remember that all these different fields have used different names like if you're in psychology you talk about so the action you talk about the response and in control theory you would talk about the the control instead of the policy they talk about the control law instead of instead of Perception in in control theory they talk about a state estimation box In psychology the observation would be a stimulus and the reward might be reward But actually the subtleties of the Connotations of the word are somewhat different in psychology So I think it's it's kind of interesting to try to find a relatively neutral language that can Apply to all these all these different fields Okay, so I'm unblocked the transition model the transition model is supposed to be the model of the world It's gonna have your domain major place where domain knowledge is Okay, I'm not gonna talk about that today So let's get rid of that. Anyway, but it would do planning. That's how you do planning We're not gonna talk about that But I do want to talk today as part of talking about the reward hypothesis about the The other box the value function box is the value function is the major source of Learning input of changes in the policy And this notion of a value function is also common to all these fields Hey, I through reinforcement learning has value functions psychology has has Reinforcers and secondary reinforcers and and it's built up in the same way and There are issues of proxy objective functions and control theory that are all about Constructing value functions. So what is this value function thing? Let's talk about that Oh, but I couldn't I couldn't resist I want I got in this x1 extra slide where I'm just It does remind me to say to say one important thing that even though there's only one objective the reward to maximize reward the agent can well as as as Means as Solution strategies it might have it might pose some problems for itself other problems for itself Like you might learn how to how to walk or how to drink a glass or how to navigate to the monk school You learn all those things that they're not your main task But it might if you learn how to do those things it may be useful for solving the main task. So you you My theory of of mind and the next step of that theory would be that we We pose some problems for ourselves and solve those and then use those skills that we develop working on the sub problems In order to solve the real problem, which is to maximize reward Okay, so value functions. We're getting almost done value functions So reward and value reward defines what's good. So we seek a policy that maximizes reward That's done defining the problem But reward is often delayed and that makes it hard to learn a policy using reward And so instead of working directly with reward value functions map states to predictions of the future reward if you have prediction of the future that includes the Delay and if you can bring that into the into the present if you can predict now what the future rewards will be that enables you to Eliminate the delay and makes finding a good policy much easier Maybe that's intuitive you think about I always think about playing chess You know the reward is checkmating your opponent And so then you get maybe a plus one for checkmating a minus one for losing is zero for drawings so that is and of course Formally you get a reward all during the game, but they're all zero and you only get an interesting reward at the end and So there's a delay between any good move or poor move You might make early in the game and and whether you won or you lost and so of course what we would all do is we would Learn to predict. Am I going to be checkmated in this game? Okay, so that's a prediction of the future and it's often called an evaluation function or a value function It's a prediction of the reward. So I think it's it's Well, this is the the value function hypothesis is that Forming such value. I guess that's that's that's right on my slide here The value function hypothesis is that all efficient methods for solving Sequential decision problems, which is what just means decision problems over and over again through time They learn or compute Value functions as an intermediate solution step So when you're gonna play chess you learn the sense of am I when you're losing and then you know when you make a bad move and now You thought you were winning and now you're losing you see then no That's the critical part Where you made the mistake and you can use that to assign credit to your policy and change your policy in a much better way Okay, so that's all sounds awfully technical Let's go back to philosophy go back to Plato, you know You can find in Plato talking about good and evil and pleasure and pain and he will say things that are a lot like this These are some quotes even enjoying yourself. You call evil whenever it leads to the loss of a pleasure greater than its own Or it lays up pains lays up pains that outweigh its pleasures Isn't it the same when we turn back to pain to suffer pain you call good When it either rids us of greater pains than its own or leads to pleasures that outweigh them So what does he say he's saying good and evil are about the sum of upcoming reward? Which is what we try to predict with a value function So basically it's all hedonism. It's all hedonism, but value functions make it hedonism with foresight Okay, that's the story the main story of reward and value how we use them in decision-making to change our policies But I want to try to do one more thing I get you understand the way it works in a little bit more I don't know if this is gonna work, but let me try I call it the mystery of expectation and reinforcement I call it the mystery of expectation and reinforcement now Superficially those are new topics. I haven't talked about expectation and haven't talked about reinforcement But by expectation I mean like the prediction of reward that the value function is the value function learns predictions i.e expectations of upcoming reward and Reinforcement reinforcement Is not reward reinforcement is the Moment-by-moment signal that reinforces the behavior at that time So it's really your sense of did I do something good or did I do something bad is should I stamp what in should I stamp in what? I did or not so reinforcement is not reward because there are many cases And we just alluded to some of them where you get say a positive reward, but you View it negatively And so expectations play a role there so expectations Contribute negatively to reinforcement in the sense like you know I went to the movie I thought it'd be a really good movie and I went there. I was just kind of so so so actually I feel bad about it so so expectations are Negatively to the reinforcement movie was just so so but because you expected it to be good That gave you a bad feeling about it a bad negative reinforcement But expectations also contribute positively to reinforcement like when you Expect to get reward that that is a reinforcing event if you if you I don't know are given a million dollars That's a good thing, okay, but it's actually not really reward reward becomes because you expect to have a million dollars and be able to use it you know to buy Good food or anything you might want so that would be the reward and the expectations are also positive And so that's the mystery. How can expectations contribute both positively and negatively it is in just a common-sense way and the answer is over time and So just consider this simple case of evolving through three states states one two and three and This is like your life some life moment by moment so three moments two transitions and I'll just take it that your expectations your predictions your values of the three states are zero ten and zero and then The rewards on the when you experience these three states are zero and eight Okay, so now I want to ask you the question or ask you to ask this question of yourself How do you feel about the first transition? So what's the reinforcing effect is it positive? It's negative like is it good is it bad as you went from state one to state two and It's I want you to give me a number because it's all coming down to numbers So what number would you give to that transition from state one to state two Expectation was zero now. It's ten the reward was zero. Do you feel good? You feel bad? Anybody John's giving me a thumbs up she was giving me a thumbs up Yeah, I think we're gonna say this is like a plus ten experience because You weren't expecting anything and you didn't get anything right away But you now you now you expect to get ten in the future. That's like the getting the million dollars And now the second transition What do you expect? Expecting ten you got eight and now you don't expect anything in the future That's gonna be like minus two Okay, so that all makes sense. It's very intuitive. Okay, so if you just Make a formula out of what you you've just understood is as obviously what should happen You're gonna end up with temporal difference learning the fundamental algorithm of of Reinforcement learning. Okay, so the the thing you just formed in your head was that the reinforcement is sure it's the reward But beyond that it's the change in your expectation from one time step to the next As has the expectation gone up as it gone down And so it's the sum of the reward and the change in the expectation because it's a change It's a temporal difference temporal difference just means time difference, which is just change It's the change in your expectation contributes to the reinforcement. And so this is the temporal difference error and also called the reward prediction error and I need to finish up, but I did want to mention since it's such an interdisciplinary Conference that this theory of brain systems as Following TD learning is one of the most Important interactions ever between engineering science as a neuroscience is a big big thing around the turn of the century And finally my last slide is on ethics So what we've talked about rewards are a good way to think about the ultimate goal and value functions Which are predictions of reward are a good way to think about how that goal is achieved. All this is neat and complete It's a good theory of a single agents decision making But it's it doesn't have what we would expect what we might hope to get from a theory of ethics is that there would be some universality to it there would be a Reason to for different agents to have similar values, you know, that's what that's that's what I understand ethics to be about It's when we reach for some universality rather than just an individual and what we have so far doesn't have any element of that and I'm gonna now admit that I have no no sense how Any universality could occur and so I want to propose that maybe there is no universality there's a need to be universal Sality for there to be ethics. Maybe we just Many of us have there is an aspect of what we do of commonality between many people and That that's what ethics is about. It's so this is a reductionist hypothesis again that maybe ethics is just values that are happened to be held in common by many agents and so even though Even things that are held in common by many agents won't be held in common by all agents The lion and the gazelle will have different values So that's really all I wanted to say and I thought it would be a good basis for starting a discussion of ethics Thank you very much You're up Jinx Thanks, Rich, I'm really glad we got a chance to do this and thanks to Jillian for the same reason So I'm gonna start with just a little bit of housekeeping disciplinary housekeeping just to make sure we're all on the same page So like any paradigm Reinforcement learning is going to have certain technical and foundational commitments and then Loss of different versions of those frameworks are going to add certain assumptions and relax others And so just before I get started I want to make clear two assumptions that I'm committing to because they will inform kind of what I say next I'm gonna call this RL star or sometimes they can also be called RLDM like reinforcement learning and decision-making I Think it also make clear maybe where where Rich and I agree and sometimes might disagree So the first assumption In my kind of particular Version of reinforcement learning is that there is in fact something really special About reinforcement learning when it comes to understanding the mind, right? And so I think this is an assumption we share we both subscribe to this assumption Peter Diane who just got mentioned and put up as like a little plastic bobble head and yell these Put forward something like the following claim so reinforcement learning algorithms such as the temporal defense learning Rule apparent to be directly instantiated in neural mechanisms such as the phasic activity of dopamine neurons That reinforcement learning appears to be so transparently embedded has made it possible To use it in a much more immediate way to make hypotheses about and Retradictive and predictive interpretations of a wealth of behavioral and neural data collected in a huge range of paradigms and systems, right? So there's this Is the sound coming out already? Yeah, I've been wondering that too. So thanks, Rich There's a star beside instantiated for the philosophers of science in the room. Just relax about that It doesn't matter we can just say look reinforcement learning is shockingly surprisingly good about capturing something of the mind We don't have to commit to instantiate. It's one of those weasel words we talked about yesterday It's a quote from them, but that's just not what we don't want to talk about here There's something about reinforcement learning That is extremely powerful when it comes to understanding the mind whether it's instantiated or not So that's the first commitment that I'm making here the second commitment where we may disagree although sudden June 21st 2023 suggest maybe that's not the case is that Mines like ours so personally assigned subjective rewards somehow so there's a big debate about this question of where do rewards come from? right and the kind of classic view is that reward comes externally and That is an important tenet of some frameworks of reinforcement learning But I'm gonna go ahead and say and this is kind of an agnostic claim that the mind somehow Internalizes reward there are good competing theories for how that takes place Such as by Chris and refilled it doesn't matter. I just want to say that the mind somehow Internalizes reward in ways that are important So that's gonna be a commitment where we perhaps depart from one another But it's gonna inform kind of how we want to go forward about this Okay, so that's a bit of ground-clearing What I want to use my time For today and kind of as a basis or a backdrop for the discussion Let's make three claims about kind of this version of reinforcement learning and what it means For understanding the mind and so the first question that we have right is you know Is the reward hypothesis a good model for understanding the mind? And As rich has pointed out, you know, it's been kind of transformative in the decision sciences and all those schools that we talked about Cognitive neuroscience computational neuroscience psychology economics increasingly. I think in philosophy It's like making inroads in philosophy But I would actually say the first kind of claim that I want to make is that it's still underappreciated In how much it should and can transform my understanding of what the mind is fundamentally in the business of doing So this is kind of the cartoon dialectic slide, right? I think when we think of the mind we have historically but even in Recent kind of cognitive scientific history. So we've seen this in Joel's slide in Blaise's slide Yesterday is you know, when we think of what the mind is fundamentally in the business of doing As how Glenn put it, you know, it's about thinking. It's what intellect. It's it's fundamentally kind of an epistemic machine It's what the mind is a computer And one of the ways that we can put that is that the mind is in the business of performing computations over representations of descriptive matter of fact, which is just to say the mind is in the business of making better and worse kind of Assessments of what's going on out there in the world. Is it raining? You know, what day of the week is it? It's about knowing the world so that we can move around in it In various ways and so more or less factive representations of the world out there And I hope Blaise's ears are ringing right now because he basically went up yesterday and said, you know Maximum entropy first in all these people, you know, a new way of putting these kind of very epistemic Conceptions of mind is that it's all about prediction You know, the mind is a prediction machine and all we do is make predictions about what's out there in the world Then we update them. So but again, it's it's essentially about knowing in some lowercase case Sense of what the mind is all about And I really disagree with that I think the thing that we learn from the reward hypothesis and kind of the reinforcement learning framework that follows from it is That the mind not only performs computations over Representations of descriptive matters of fact, but the mind also Fundamentally performs computations over those representations as better or worse So we are continually Representing the world as we move around in it, you know what this room looks like What day of the week it is whether it's raining or not But as part and parcel of that process, we are also continually representing all of these states as Better or worse with respect to our goals So what we're doing is we're laying over these fabrics kind of of the states and assigning Value in the way that rich just described and so we're not just seeing whether it's raining, but oh, it's raining Here's what that means for me or oh, it's raining. I live in London, of course, it's raining, right? These things can matter more or less, but that we're not just experiencing the world. We're Continually evaluating and so I think one of the things that the report hypothesis and Tells us is that the mind is not just a thinking machine. It's a valuation machine. It's continually evaluating Now one of the examples that I like to use for this is kind of the thin end of the wedge. It's very narrow case But it's the phenomenon of vernacular robbery. So vernacular rivalry occurs when you place some kind of division between the left eye and the right eye And you show one stimulus to one eye and another stimulus to the other eye. So in this case borrowed from Feldman Barrett's lab is one eye sees one eye is presented I should say with a house and one side is presented with a face and what you might expect The participants to see is you know house face But the reason vernacular rivalry is interesting is because what they actually perceive what they actually experience is an alternation They see a house they see a face they see a house and they see a face and obviously for you know, the view that the mind is Engaging with the world that the mind is computer that we're making prediction machines This is a very interesting case because we know for a fact that we are not perceiving What we are essentially seeing right the experience Strictly departs from what we know is being presented and This was a very important test case for predictive processing and first in like folks because they gave a very elegant Explanation of what's going on? So they basically gave a Bayesian interpretation of predictive of vernacular rivalry and said that roughly what happens is that we have very low Priors for seeing a house face in the natural world And so what the mind does is it says well it can't be a house face So it must be a ha it must be a house But then the prediction error comes back up and says normal You're only accounting for half of what you're experiencing here So it must be the other stimulus and it switches and so it's saying okay now it's a face Again a strong prediction error and an ultrace And what you have here is you know perceptual dominance So you might see the face first or you might see the face for longer or it might alternate more Okay, the mind is a thinking machine. It's epistemic great We have a very you know epistemically normatively informed explanation of what's going on there The reason I like to use vernacular rivalry as a case for the evaluative mind Is that when you subscribe to something like the reward hypothesis as I did? Let's say in 2017 when I was presented with this is that I thought you know, I bet you reward will modulate This phenomenon so it allows you to make predictions even from the armchair and I bet you reward will Modulate the experience vernacular rivalry and that is in fact what you find so if you Reward a certain stimulus like the face so you say hey, I'm gonna give you a penny every time the face appears We have perceptual dominance Of the face but it gets better than that you can also reward just the percept so people don't cheat basically and Every time they report seeing a face you can do like a pitching And again the face will be more dominant. You'll have perceptual dominance First in folks when you email them They're like yeah, but it could just be information right the reward is an added piece of information So you can put that into kind of your Bayesian function and that can still explain Why this perceptual dominance is occurring, but what you can do is you can have a Punished percept so every time they see a house you can make a little sound that says You know like you're sad And if it's just information you should have perceptual dominance of the house That's not what you find you actually still have perceptual dominance Of the non-punished percept of the face so really what this tells you and this might glamorize the finding a bit You want me to like Animate less. Yeah, no, I know I know I know it's okay I'll try Yes, sorry I will hold on to the podium This is a small finding but it tells you basically that to some very limited non-exciting degree you see you perceive What it is in your interest with respect to your goals to perceive right again, this is a very thin case is very narrow case But it tells you that you don't just Perceive the world we perceive the world conditional on our goals Which in this case is to make a little bit of funny in these studies, right? Binocular rivalry is a tiny case, but if you look at all the research That kind of riches alluded to over the course of the last several decades We find that every stage of mental processing from sensation And computation to action at every level of description and mental processing from the sub personal to the personal It's conditional on these attributions of reward and value So we sense we perceive and we attend to the features of our environment conditional on reward and value we remember and remember to remember remember prospectively conditional on the attribution of Reward and value our cognitive control our ability to decide choose Plan our future actions in each case you will find a body of evidence that's just it's just like in binocular rivalry It is conditional on the attribution of reward so We have this kind of classic sorry picture of the mind as a thinking machine I think that's part of the story, but the mind is also continually in the business of evaluating all of these parts of the so-called kind of cognitive sandwich So I want to make some kind of caveats here. First of all, it's an additive thesis What I want to say is that the mind computes over these representations of matter-of-fact and it continually evaluates them now for some people that might seem kind of weak sauce Particularly, I think philosophers sometimes want to come out swinging and say, you know, this is everything I call that the stronger thesis the stronger thesis something like what the mind is fundamentally in the business of doing is Evaluating things is better or worse, right? That's that's mainly what the mind is about. I don't want to go that far We can talk about that in the discussion of why not I want to say that the mind is fundamentally in the business of doing both So I'm making an additive claim. I don't subscribe to the stronger thesis Although I do think it's kind of fun and it it does kind of really drive a lot of nice research And I also don't think this is exactly the same thing as saying reward is enough My claim is about the nature of the mind and what the mind is in the business of doing I take reward is enough on one interpretation to be saying What's needed in order to produce intelligent behavior? Those are obviously cousins as positions But I think reward is enough again Make some stronger claims than than than what I would subscribe to but that's definitely something that we can talk to you But I think we need to start thinking of the mind as evaluative in these ways not just because that's what we're doing But also if we want to design artificial intelligence, that is a very different picture of what we're trying to build And we'll also go towards addressing some of the kinds of challenges that we heard about yesterday So the first question was does the reward hypothesis provide a good model for understanding the mind? Yeah, I really think it does and the answer to that is yes And I think it changes our understanding of what the mind is kind of in the business of doing The second question is you know, how far does the reward hypothesis go as you might imagine I'm gonna say something like pretty far So I gave you a list of kind of all the the kinds of Processes that reward and value are are implicated in and you can kind of see that a lot of these are sort of you know So called low-level cognitive capacities But all the way kind of extending into sort of high level cognitive capacities that people might be be interested in and so I don't want to go into that too much, but I want to focus on what you might think as one of the kind of Crown jewels of the human mind, right, which is our ability to have moral experiences If there's anything that we might want to think is special, but how the mind works One would be language I can talk about that after yesterday But another one might be our ability to have moral experiences, so when I say moral cognition I mean something quite straight forward It's the capacity to create and respond to situations of moral significance. So let me give you an example. It's nothing fancy You know my sister Barbara Goes to buy a coffee at a coffee shop and she can make the following decision She can buy the more expensive fair-trade coffee or she can buy the cheaper Commercially sourced coffee, right and she can stand in line. She can make that decision and she Realistically probably past the cheaper commercially sourced coffee. Sorry Barbara But that is an example of moral cognition. She's not making a decision about a trolley problem or anything like that These are the everyday routine moral experiences that we have that we make like this and that's the kind of thing that I have in mind When I'm talking about moral cognition So again, they're kind of quite well established received views on kind of how our moral cognition Works what the mechanisms behind that are and so Again, this this isn't actually even too much of a cartoon. I think we have kind of these rationalist inferentialist Views where the idea is that Barbara Does or doesn't buy the fair-trade coffee based on the belief or set of beliefs that something is the right thing to do And then it will kind of follow from you know her knowledge about a particular situation On the other end of that dichotomy There's this idea that Barbara might do or not do the right thing Because of her moral emotions She might feel empathy towards the workers or not So an agent has the fitting moral emotion or emotions that something is the right thing to do And then despite the kind of distribution of the literature actually I think a lot of mainstream views Are hybrid views some combination of the views that you know certain things that you have certain kinds of beliefs You have the relevant beliefs. You also have the accompanying emotions that might motivate that behavior And we should definitely talk about that Plato slide, but without going all the way back to you Plato I think these have been kind of the main Alternatives in understanding moral psychology and understanding our moral cognition. I Think the reward hypothesis suggests that there's a kind of a new player on the scene And that moral cognition is in fact constituted by the sub personal attribution of goal and context Dependent subjective reward value. So again that familiar phrase that we see What we need to see in binocular rivalry is actually one important ingredient that mechanism is also driving our experiences of saying something like That's just wrong. That's morally disgusting. I really ought to be doing this thing Again in the descriptive cases, but what I am suggesting is that we actually recruit the same reward mechanisms In our moral cognitive experiences now I'll flush that out again because that's a bit strong and a bit strong stuff But what I want to suggest is that There is quite a lot of flattening going on here, right? So in fact When you are experiencing Something as right or wrong you are attributing reward and value or laying that fabric in just the same way in a moral Context with moral determinants like something like fairness something like honesty as you are when you are just choosing between You know left and right to your coffee So that's to say that if I'm choosing between to your coffee or coffee and fair-trade coffee I'm actually recruiting some of the same mechanisms now again There will be caveats that come to kind of flesh out this picture But this is an important flattening of our understanding of what's going on in our moral psychology in our moral cognitive experiences And you might think okay, but I really feel strongly about certain You know moral propositions, and I don't feel particularly strongly about to your coffee or something like that and Sort of the second thesis of this view is that reward and value the strength of the reward and value are actually the source of our Moral motivational force so through our evolutionary history and through our upbringing certain things are reinforced To be extremely important to be absolute no-knows or absolute musts And that these are the sources of why we sometimes feel that something is right or wrong and why we experience things Something we really ought to do again. This is not a normative on but it's the feeling of I oh I really should call my grandmother or something like that It's because the driving mechanism here is again reward and the value not my emotions not my Knowledge though again, I'll build a kind of more complete puzzle there And so this is kind of one of the things that fundamentally differentiates between something like our social and our moral values Right, we know we shouldn't wear white after Labor Day Or we did know that once when I was like five That has some force, but it has much different force from you know It's wrong to lie and that is I think a function of the strength of the value that has been Attributed to that over the course of our lifetime experiences our Education's our philosophical conversations and things like that So it's a source of the strength of the moral motivational force Now this is pretty quick and again, I'm gonna flush out the picture in a second, but I think This kind of you starts to account for features of our moral psychology that the kind of rationalist Inferentialist views and the sentimentalist views don't account for so it doesn't it it accounts for something like the multidimensional nature It's hard to explain the Barbara fair-trade coffee case with just the emotions, right? There's lots of features that need to be weighed off there that a kind of complex Waiting of our values allows us to explain explains why sometimes she buys fair-trade coffee and sometimes she doesn't Why we have cross cultural values, so we have themes in our values So all communities, you know value honesty, but what it means to be honest or what it means to murder or what counts as incest is going to vary in us because we share some of these Mechanisms, but how we tune them up is going to really depend on the community and the culture same with moral learning It's going to Allow us to understand kind of what counts as morally exceptional, right where people stand up against all kinds of opposition and costs and But we're going to kind of place a very high value on the certain principle and stand by that principle Through that strong moral motivational force and I think kind of one of the The more complex but also more compelling kind of pieces of evidence for a view like this is What happens when we have failures in our moral cognition make errors? We have dysfunctions and sometimes we have pathologies in our moral cognition And one of the interesting things is that these seem to rise and fall With dysfunctions in our reward systems in our reward mechanisms in ways that we wouldn't necessarily expect to see otherwise, so I think I do want to specify that I think it's a part of the puzzle again It's going to be an inclusive view in the same way that the evaluative mind is an inclusive view That's not to say that we don't have any place for the emotions In our moral cognitive experiences. It doesn't mean that we don't reason and read philosophy and things like this But when you're standing in the coffee shop and you're trying to decide whether you're making Whether you're going to buy the fair-trade coffee or not What you're recruiting there are your valuation systems and your life-long experiences Of what you value and what we attribute our values over now I think one key open question here is what do we attribute those rewards and values over is it to states? Is it to state action pairs? Is it to abstract ideas? Is it possible that philosophers for example have learned to attribute a high amount of value just to the concept of Justice and the existence of justice in the world, right? I think these are important questions of how exactly it plays out But I think and here I will take a dig actually at that Plato slide It's not about pleasure and pain actually I think pleasure so I follow Kent barrage here and distinguishing between pleasure and pain and Reward and punishment or reward and and disappointment and I think our moral cognitive theories have been based on what we can introspect Oh, I think this oh, I feel this and we don't necessarily have introspective access to our reward mechanisms And so I think actually in a way It's a disservice to try and tie it back to hedonism because it's rewarded something different here that hasn't been on the scene But I think is a driving factor in this much more complex architecture of our of our moral cognition So how far does it go? It goes pretty far It goes to certain things that I think we thought, you know, we're a little bit untouchable in our human experience And again, I'm just touch on this and we can talk about it in the discussion, but I think it really informs How we understand Moral artificial intelligence because this is actually quite tractable. This is actually quite quantifiable We can actually go much further in understanding what works and what doesn't work in our moral cognition Because we have this nice Quantifiable computational theory and we can go much farther and understanding our moral cognitive experiences And in designing those right so morality on a sore architecture is gonna suck But it doesn't need to suck because that's actually not how it works in us either And so I think having a handle on this opens some pretty interesting avenues even in the realm of artificial intelligence So lastly, and this will be the fastest part But the third question should it should this understanding then guide our normative decision-making and here It'll definitely depart have from from rich. I think my answer straightforward Lee That got formatted out of existence. Sorry Is no so I take guide to be pretty strong Guide means I should then use this to govern my normative decision-making And the analogy that I often draw here is that moral cognition should be understood in analogy to folk physics So, you know the Wiley Coyote case where Wiley runs off the cliff and hangs out there for a second and then falls right or Other cases might be Muller liar illusions or putting a straw in a cup and things like that We have understandings of physics that are produced by our sensations and our perceptions that we know to be incorrect and If we rely on them, we will not land on the moon and we will You know not make other scientific achievements, and I think we have to understand moral cognition as the equivalent of folk physics It's full of errors now does that mean that the reward hypothesis is not useful No, because I actually think it's really important to understand Where our moral cognition reliably and in fact systemically falls down, right? So this is have basically reduced to a bumper sticker. I used to walk past Basically every day when I was doing my PhD, which says don't believe everything you think, right? It's you've all seen it It's right, but actually that's basically exactly what this is is we have very strong moral experiences hatred judgment empathy But we shouldn't believe all of those right but what the reward hypothesis and what reinforcement learning along with many other Contributions allow us to do is understand the mechanisms that generate those things that we experience is right or wrong And I do think that's powerful. I wouldn't use it to guide normative decision-making I wouldn't say okay. Well that I guess that's what we're doing But I think we can use it to inform it in the following way So one of the things that I have suggested is that we should have a kind of fault line approach So when I say fault line, I mean something like tectonic plate movement, right? If you understand the movement of tectonic plates You can make nice predictions about where earthquakes and volcanoes are going to occur where things are gonna kind of continually erupt And I think if you can understand the contours of our moral cognitive decision-making You can also start to see sort of the fault lines We're not just gonna make token errors in our moral cognitive judgments We're gonna make type errors in our moral cognitive judgments and I think we can use that to inform then The kinds of things because I think in in sort of everyday life We really do take our moral cognitive experiences at face value with one another and I think that's a mistake Whereas if we have a kind of causal understanding of what generally sees and where they might depart Then that can be used as a kind of type remediation Of what's going on not necessarily in a policy sense or anything like that But I certainly think you know, it's useful knowledge to have it can inform us for the better I think it's good to know kind of the contours of the mistakes that you're making But I wouldn't say guide because of the way these things are generated So I think that might be a place where we depart So yeah, I think it's pretty productive Thanks, Julia and and rich that's just terrific. I'm so glad I got you both on to this conversation And and I I have a couple of questions to get us started, but also Ready to sort of follow with different directions. You'd like to head I heard two things perhaps that it might be worth exploring one was pleasure and pain And rich I don't know if you want to respond to that one and the second one Oh, which I'll come back to is is the guiding normative decision-making, but let's take on pleasure and pain Is that an important part of how you're thinking about this to me the pleasure and pain are just examples of what reward might be Well, I think it was the play-doh slide. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, he was clearly talking about pleasure and pain Reward could be pleasure payment. It's undoubtedly more complicated than that And I agree with you that we don't know what our word signal is we we don't have introspection introspective access to it And and more than that What we do have an introspective access to it is the I Want to call it TD error remember it's the thing I was talking about is reinforcement It's which is which is this measure of how do we feel about how well things are going this as you're saying the Constant sense of our things getting better or worse. We evaluating all the time So we have access to our evaluations and we we have very Preeminent access or prominent access to our things getting better or worse But things getting better and worse if you remember it's the reward plus the change in your evaluation function and So these two things the reward and the change in your evaluation these two are mixed together And so when you feel good or feel bad, you don't know if it's you don't really know if it's because the reward was high Or the change in evaluation was high and so So that is a confusion that we all have we don't know Once so once an evaluation a value function becomes very well established then, you know, it feels Bad when our values are violated just as if we had you know a form of pain or a bad thing directly. So This is this is a major phenomenon, you know in terms of our subjective experience that it's hard to tell Difficulties in a reward and a change of value Doing anything Yeah, I would say that and again this is Following Kent Barrage. I think pleasure and pain are sick, you know are evolved biological signals of reward and value and As signals, they're pretty good, which means they go together a lot of the time I think one of the cases that the barrage talks about is the case of for example a digger This might be David Reddish talking about cases of addiction to heroin which where the signals and the reward and disappointment come apart so You very clearly start to have not pleasurable experiences When you will become a heroin addict, but the reward is so strong That you continue to do it right heroin is basically ruining your life But because it's hijacked the reward mechanisms and you continue. So these are kind of edge cases but I mean, I think one of the powers of Like the reward hypothesis, but also the scientific process and that discovery that you're talking about with Peter Diane and others Is that it really gets at an important part? Of of our kind of mechanistic composition that we don't have direct introspective access to you But where there are departures between what a hedonistic or pleasure and pain-based view would predict about us? And what the reward view would predict about us and and clearly the reward view makes better predictions is better supported by the evidence and so It's kind of funny saying this to you But I would say like there's no reason to lean into the pleasure and pain because like reward actually provides a Better model in some cases, even though they you know, they often walk together So you're thinking it's important to keep the distinction I mean the reward way of talking is more abstract and And If it was equated with pain Pain and pleasure then it becomes more specific and And that they're there for falsifiable Which is good Yeah, so I'm totally on board of course with it's a general thing it doesn't have to be pain and pleasure and there may be cases I mean, I think I Guess that totally makes sense to me like there may be pain and then maybe you could Change so that the pain is less important to you or the pleasure is less important. Yeah, it's just more general The reward is more general I think another example might be the emotions where again we have introspective access to our emotions And in that very hastily shown chart, right? I think there's incredibly close coupling Between our affective responses fear anger and so on and the valuation component But you might ask yourself, you know, how do you know I lost that between the the emotions and and the Valuations, yeah, and so if you are you have a component theory of affect or emotion You say that there's an appraisal component of the emotion, right? What triggers certain emotions? Well on my view would be something like the valuation system the reward system But I think you lose a lot if you only look at the introspective component. You say it's all emotion Emotion is important But actually the emotions are kicked off by the valuation or mechanism by the valuation assessment that then triggers these ballistic responses like empathy or fear or anger or so on so I think again, they're they're very close I don't know if bad fellows is the right word like these things really run together But I do think that you come up with cases that reward accounts for and the emotions do not and that there are cases where reward explains the phenomenon and pleasure and pain do not and so I Do you think it's you know, they're obviously very closely related but something is lost by blurring between those two Maybe I Of course economists of which I am one Have thought of and debated about these questions a lot because we represent a utility function Most of the modeling is done with the idea that you can take all decision-making and put it into a Continuous function, but I want to press a little bit because I hear in Julia's framework Again with this concept this broader concept of valuation to say like your brain may actually have many sources many valuations schemes that aren't necessarily Representable as a continuous Scaler reward and so I wouldn't want to push on the scalar part because I think that's a difference between What you've presented and That's the economics agrees with the scalar Yeah, you do. Yeah, I do. All right. I'll be the disagreeer. Yeah So there's a nice paper by I'll come up with the name in a second Which just basically suggests that you can have these vectors that reduced to the scalar and so that there are kind of mathematical ways of Taking that kind of consideration and still having it reduced to scalar and you can say like whoof the theory holds that it's scalar And so I think I'm probably less invested in this part of of it But that would be the way that I would appeal to it is that you can accommodate that kind of intuition and still preserve the scalar feature of The theory, but you might want to defend it like more The original work arguing that you can reduce the vector to the scalar is in second is in economics I Morgan Stern and Somebody rather you know, well, yes, it's hope and see there's a debate in economics about and and but by far the dominant Neoclassical economics is that you can you can do that. Yeah, but there's also a different project in economics, which is We're trying to build models that will predict the way humans and Entities composed of humans like markets will behave and so then when you say it's enough You're saying oh, it's good enough to be predictive And so one of the things I think about is how much are we taking that and now saying well, this is the way Valuation works in Human societies in the human and in human societies and I guess I want to put a wedge in there to say You know, it could be that I could predict pretty well even if values are incommensurate and can't be reduced to a trade-off Nonetheless at the end of the day. I'm just predicting are you gonna choose this or this so I could have a representation That worked for that predictive exercise so All bets are off when you have groups you know the the the basic theory is the theory of an individual and and Yet and yet we want to move to say something interesting about About groups or to ask if it's possible to say anything normative or Yeah, can we say something normative normative, so what does this mean this mean I See I might any definition I'll give will be reductive again, so So how can we walk up to this so one way to walk up to it is the way Julia did which saying well, maybe these The moral decisions Are are not that different from the ordinary decision-making we do it every day And to that to me that makes sense And so I mean I want to push and say that for the individual we can think of it all as one system Now to make it a little bit more acceptable to you that it might be that way You want sure you remember that the the value judgments as well as the policy But let's the value judgments are compiled. They are they are they may they may be due to learning or reasoning but in the end they are they are they are like they're Hard-coded and they're automatic and they're intuitive. They're not the reasons for them are no longer present that's so I see the reasons you might have a very firm feeling that that Children should have a loving parent and You might not have Any more have the reasons for that belief you just believe it really strongly and and maybe maybe there was a reason for it Maybe you had experience or you've seen people or you've done some reasoning process and you came up with a reason But but now you just know you have this belief and so this is why we tend to think of values as core things And and more emotional Because we we don't have the reasons now it doesn't mean we lost the reasons You know, maybe the reasons who are built built into us by evolution to me It doesn't really matter. You have ended up with a judgment about the the the goodness or badness of certain things and and Nevertheless a good way to think about them maybe as a prediction of the likely rewards For being in that state or acting in that way And to me that that's a really exciting Apothos that you might be able to think about of all the judgments that people may including their moral ones in terms of a single framework So I want to separate that is that impressive and I feel you from your talk that you were like trying to lead lead us that way and So I want to separate that there are two big things to talk about is that makes sense. Okay, and then If that makes sense What about when you have multiple agents and and then and we asked the question of universality and normative judgments So are we at the? Yeah, are we ready to have we have we done accepted the first thing and are we ready to do the second thing? Are we still unsure and I'm I'm gonna ask you, you know, everyone, you know Anyway, these these these two steps Are we ready? So can I just jump in on that real quick because I think there's a step between is that okay? Yeah, no, that's great And then I'll go to question. Um, so I like this idea of reasons are no longer present So on the slide and have time to talk about it, but I had this case of moral dumbfounding. So moral dumbfounding is when You give people scenarios like, you know You know Jane and and John are brother and sister and and they would like to have sex Just the one time with protection. So, you know, there's no possibility of any of the genetic consequences of, you know incest and so on and so forth and you ask people like, you know, is this morally acceptable and you know and You ask them and they'll give you kinds of reasons, but they they can't really so it's this dumbfounding case where you're like Yeah, okay, there should be everything fine with this. The other cases are like having sex with the chicken Anyway, there's some stuff going on in the lab there that came up these examples But there's strong cases we have these the responses and I really like this way of putting the reasons are no longer present Right, the reasons are good reasons But they're no longer present in this case because if if John and Jane or whatever I said use contraception then, you know This this evolved reason for why we're opposed morally opposed to incest is no longer there But that's actually a really important Junction, right? That suggests that those intuitions Maybe over the course of evolution are a good signal of reward or not, but that there are departures from that And that's where the normative Story comes in so we have these descriptive experiences like no, but the reasoning and the moral philosophy or the ethics or Policymaking or all these normative disciplines law economics come in because we tell ourselves, okay But shunning the outgroup may no longer be doing us a service because we live in a global cosmopolitan society where We all want to get along And who's getting along there is all of a sudden a much bigger group And so I think you can have a part of that first story which is radical in and of itself But not necessarily follow it all the way to step two Because sometimes we believe things that are just Silly like you shouldn't have sex with a chicken So I I'm just I'm gonna I'm gonna just throw out there and then I'll come to the audience and I may want to put Joel and will on the spot on this one as well, but You know the the the idea of thinking about the values or as or the as Intuitions as Some kind of thing that is just there We don't know where it came from it accumulated from arts as opposed to which is what I really like about your framework Julia is It's a very active process and actually so I make the claim in the work that I'm doing thinking about normative systems And I have a very very reductive definition of normativity It's what the group labels and we just have a labeling scheme This group says this is okay, and this is not okay, and we've you know coordinated a cognitive structures and institutions And so on to to produce that but it's adaptive it changes We get angry about rule violations But you can go to a different environment where the rule is different and you used to get mad when people came into the building with short shorts on and now you don't Right, and so I think it's it's it's very much a Processing of the information from the group So it's a group thing It's a pick a particular group all groups don't have to agree Even a single group may change its mind over time Yes, and that that's actually a complex system to understand how that how that functions And the silly rules about chickens for example or something that thought a fair bit about But I want to make sure we get because I know that there's lots of provocations for our audience here to to contribute on so let me Let me open it up here. I'm gonna go to Jennifer first Yes Yes, and do wait for the mic So so this is sort of following up on Julia's claim that minds Subpersonally a sign reward, and I don't disagree with that. I think absolutely we do that I'm curious about whether we also personally do this and whether it's not an expression of our Autonomy as rational agents capable of setting goals that we do this This is also my reservation about the sort of McCarthy definition of intelligence as You know being about the computational part of achieving goals surely we can apply our rational intelligence to setting Goals, I mean we don't have that much flexibility with respect to the sort of homeostatic needs that are Encoded in us as biological creatures But but beyond that we're on a long leash from evolution and we can surely in Rational conversations with each other work towards finding Goals that stand the test of You know rational scrutiny and And and and so that kind of that kind of expression of our freedom Intellectually seems to me to be a very very important application of human intelligence We're not just slaves of our reward functions, you know just looking for ways to maximize You know, whatever this damn thing is in us We get to say what we're pursuing and that seems a way in which you know our intelligence is Caught into play Isn't there a famous philosopher who said who said that our reason is a slave to the passions David Hume Reason is and ought only to be a slave to the passions Yeah, but that's you. Yeah And he's obviously wrong about that so so I'm very much on this. I'm very much on the side of the manual count here that we That that what is what is right is what is universalizable? there are so so so you know the the the maximum underpinning your conduct should be something that That is universalizable that could be could be a law for all There's there's an important contribution of the inclinations in here, right? So we have certain natural inclinations that we have to satisfy to continue our existence as the kinds of biological creatures That we are and we may have to discover things about people's inclinations empirically through interactions with each other but But the question of what we're inclined to do is Sabrable from the question of what we ought to do we can criticize our inclinations I could find myself inclined to do stuff that that I think is wrong actually even just kind of at the level of biological fitness, right? there's you know various appetites that I have towards you know sweet and salty foods and so on and I can I can appreciate rationally the reasons for which I have those inclinations and Actually reject them as you know in the current environment not contributing to my fitness. I can overrule them And that's not something that you know reckons can do That's why we're more intelligent than they are My sister literally had four raccoons in her garage this morning, so Okay, so obviously like a big question, so let me kind of try and step through that So we were talking about this a little bit yesterday, so I would say that I'm a motivational involuntary So I'll give the example of coffee, but cigarettes might be a good example for other people Over the course of my experience. I have acquired a very strong liking or a cup of coffee and That guides what I do, but again coffee is kind of a trivial case. Oh and Jennifer I definitely put an asterisk there just for you because I was like So in my defense Now I can't just reach in and say I'm not going to need that cup of coffee tomorrow I'm not going to need that cigarette and I I can't say either when you scale it up to some of my moral responses Maybe less savory moral responses. I'm just not going to judge that way or I'm going to do that thing So I don't think we can overrule them in the that that sense And I think that's basically I'm an early modern nationalist pre-con that I think that they're they're thick causal mechanisms Of course, we're not raccoons And we do have reasons we can make Outs as groups and and to the the group You know what what is normative is for group? I think one way to kind of start picking at that is that some groups are just better They have better principles and better norms that work better for the group than others So that should be a kind of clue that It's not you know that there there might be a kind of normative dimensions like okay These institutions that in fact work better towards the goals of us getting along together Close-eyed bar. So what do we do when we have this involuntarism? but we also come equipped with the raccoon plus of Knowing that there is a better way. I think we have relatively indirect paths To let's say diminishing my reward for coffee. So what I can do is I can You know drink a glass of salty water every day that I have a cup of coffee and Indirectly ratchet down The value that I place on coffee or the value that I place on the smell of a cup of coffee and so on and so forth So it's kind of an intermediate view where it's like I think we can leverage our reason But it's by no means as easy as some of us would want To hope that it is and I think it's important to emphasize this end of the debate I mean again, it's always a question of emphasis, but it's important to emphasize the difficulty because I think if we don't We think we could just pull the lever and I think that leads to all kinds of disasters basically So I want to React as well I'm really glad you asked this question because I think it's really the heart of the whole thing It's you know, is it demeaning to think that there we have there they have something that's a signal coming in I'm gonna call it pleasure and pain because it It goes with it with the demeaning aspect to it. We are a slave to our pleasure and pain and it makes us seem small And like we don't have choices and these are the most important things in our lives What are what we're trying to do with our lives and that we the idea we don't have Control of them is really annoying But I think it absolutely is true and it's true in kind of a definitional sense because When you say you have a reason for something you mean I do this because I'm trying to do this and Obviously throughout our lives. We have reasons like that. Why I'm going to work to earn money. I'm trying to earn money. So Raise a family. I'm trying to raise a family because I enjoy certain activities and I want to see things happening We all we have many many reasons and we're used to that But we also should acknowledge that eventually it has to stop, you know, you have reasons for things But eventually there's some final thing that doesn't have any reason for it or at least that's Maybe the standard way to think about things in science. I don't know, you know It's the old thing about the odds and the is is you can't derive By learning about the world you cannot really derive what you should want there's there is There is one standard philosophical view. I can't do it justice But but it's this the view that that you can't derive an ought from it is and that so you have to have some ultimate Oughts that are given and those ultimate odds are the things that we can't choose. So there must be something that we can't choose And that's what the reward is meant to be. It's the one thing that we can't choose comes from outside And it's an outside just means we can't choose it And so since that has to be true, I think even though it feels demeaning That we should get used to it and stop feeling that it makes it demeaning We have something that we ultimately want and and so we're ultimately and it's individual in some sense selfish And I think That if you embrace that it's kind of liberating, you know different people are different. They want different things It's okay for them to pursue different things Doesn't make us bad people I'm going to jump to another question because I want to make sure we get a few more people in here Sheila I Thank you so much to all three of you for for such an engaging discussion, so I was I Guess I wanted to start by just Harking back to a conversation that that rich and I had yesterday. I think I and in defense of John McCarthy I think that McCarthy in 1955 defined a notion of artificial intelligence and and that that intelligence is is a vague term Just like our conversation yesterday about about baldness, you know If I start pulling hairs out of my head at what point do I recognize that it that I'm bald Whereas with when I put that hair back in I'm when you call me this way. Yeah Anyways, I think there are lots of terms that are vague and I think that people define them purposefully And I think that intelligence is one of those so But what I but I wanted to I was really struck by by Julia's Discussion of binocular rivalry because I feel like I'm having binocular rivalry, you know between the two of you And and that we're all just trying to make sense of this this complicated idea And and we and again to a point that Julia made you know What we see the way that we interpret the way that we make sense of the world is indeed informed by by some sort of Bias we have or it's sorry. That's not the word that you use but some sort of expectation of what we want to achieve So so what I wanted to just to To to make sense of myself is Where in your conceptualizations of things you you absolutely disagree or where you actually where we're some of the Disagreements we see and even to Gillian's question about the reward hypothesis is just about what we actually Decide to highlight in our formalization or our understanding of things like so Rich even when I was looking at your your decision-making box on the right, which is one that and one of your slides Which is one that I'm very familiar with, you know, I thought where's memory? Where's long-term memory everything's been compiled You know, we're from classical Decision-making where's the notion of a you know of a of a that predictive mechanism is actually being not sort of compiled into the value function or everything being compiled into Scalar reward to Julia's response to to to Gillian and and so I guess I want to push back on on saying What are the elements that are important? Where's long-term memory? Where is where is this notion some of the the elements that actually contribute to a reward eventually being compiled into a scalar reward? And and is that diagram for you on the right? really representing everything that that it needs and then I guess Point and and and again, I thought about things again that we think about in the context of multi-agent systems about about Goal-seeking, you know the ability to create goals about Commitment about intention all of those elements that we often use to make sense of the world that that are not part of your diagrams Probably we can they're compiled in somewhere in there But I think there's utility in including them So what what do we have are there things in your formalisms that are just compiled away that are important and then? I guess the other question was where do we fundamentally or where do you in your binocular rivalry? fundamentally Or my my sense of you're the binocular of rivalry that I'm having fundamentally disagree and and and I was and maybe this is a Conversation to take offline and for afterwards But one of the things I was intrigued about is this you know what what I perceive is our perhaps our ability to be able to reflect on our Art to have an awareness of our reward to be able to reflect on our reward as as as we do Representation other representations and whether that's an element that that that that is of utility and explaining some of what we see is Understands the mind. So that's it. Well, those are a lot of things Julie is writing down her thoughts I'm not writing so I have to go first because I'll forget There are many things I will I will forget some remind me if you get them wrong First memory long-term memory There were four boxes all four boxes learn and so maybe they're four boxes are for Maybe they're for neural networks. You that'd be a fine way to think about it And then they all have weights and those weights are all adjusted through Learning and planning both so that they would all have long-term memory. Memory is throughout So I want us We can get a sense of freedom. We get a sense of intention We can set a sense of choosing goals because I do think it's a really major Psychological thing that we choose goals. We choose except they're not they're not they're not reward goals So maybe they shouldn't be called goals. They are sub-goals. They are strategies that That you choose as part of your solution of the problem the problem is fixed the problem is reward The problem is is it's the reward is not a compilation of something. It is the it is the thing that is unchanged It is not a compilation of something other things are compiled like by Learning what gets rewarding and what's not rewarding you decide what to do by learning what's rewarding. What's not rewarding you? You compile you compile into the policy you compile into the value function You even compile into the model and you compile into the perceptual process where you're figuring out Oh, this is a good way to think about the state that I'm in or this is a bad way to think about the state that I'm in all those are learned and in that sense compiled and If you want to look at reasoning reasoning is in the model of the world we learned that you know this causes that and that that that Reasoning that that knowledge of the world is in multiple levels low levels low level physics and high level decisions like like oh I'll go to the conference or I'll take this job But there's no compiling in the reward signal or you know if there's any compiling it would be evolution compiled its goals into our Reward, but for us Reward is just a primitive thing and it's never never changed And yet we absolutely it's appropriate to have the sense that we choose our sub-goals And that's the most important thing we make I'm gonna I'm going to choose to study Economics or Or our philosophy Or I'm going to choose to devote my life to understanding how the mind works. Okay, those are and I'm thinking I'm not thinking about this, but Maybe if I devote my life to figuring out how the mind works, I will enjoy myself better. I think that's what the way it goes I will forget more reward So I think yeah, there's also a multi-part and I feel like Joel basically asked you Sheila to ask this question So in terms of the question of you know emphasis and binocular rivalry, you know I think that's just the nature of scientific and philosophical theorizing, right? It's a question of emphasis in a lot of cases So depending on how we configure our audience We would either be like aggressive opponents or allies depending on who we're engaging with and the point that you're trying to get across There's just a sociological feature of that But I think where things really start to come apart is what predictions Do your commitments generate and what implications follow from your view? And that's where you also start to see some departures between us So just examples from the kind of conversation that we've had so far that I'm thinking about is okay I think we actually really disagree on this pleasure and pain thing like we're like oh No, we really disagree about that and it will generate different predictions And it has very different implications for how we understand certain things about the nature of human beings and and how we kind of follow from that I think we disagree on This normative question of what then we should take away from these experiences of values that we have It's funny because I wrote down liberating to but I mean it in a very different way It's liberating in the sense that if you recognize your limitations, that's very liberating So you accept the flaws in your system That's actually very empowering to the way that I was mentioning with the coffee because then I can use I can leverage that to become better and again, so you'll see different predictions there about what works in terms of Self-regulation and there will just be departures and in the kinds of commitments they have and then I would say in terms of What we're striving for with artificial intelligence and how we should recognize them for example as people that would be another place where You would actually see our commitments that look very similar in some places separate because of the implications that follow from that so I think But it but it really is like there's partly a sociological phenomenon of who we're engaging with and who we're trying to persuade Where in some cases we're a united front because I think the reward hypothesis Is in a minority or can be in a minority despite how powerful it is But then you know between one another we would see see big differences or something like that Thank you, and this may be our last question we'll see yeah This was a really fascinating talk I Don't have a specific question in particular, but I do want to ask in the Interests of internalizing reward and self-regulation. I think those things you brought up If it's not beyond the scope of your research, I wanted to ask about reward hacking and The idea of good-hearted law which is when the measure becomes a target it seems to be a good measure I'm really interested in hearing if you have any thoughts on that I don't know if I heard everything But reward hacking definitely happens to people. Maybe that's what drug abuse is about I'm not sure I understood everything you're asking I Can repeat if Yeah, so I was asking about reward hacking which is something you answered but also good-hearted law which is When the measure becomes a target it ceases to be a good measure If you're familiar with that law, I wanted to ask in the interest of self-regulation as something Julia mentioned If there are thoughts on that I guess good-hearted law doesn't apply because that's sort of a community thing You know it gets the measure gets manipulated by actors But if it's your own measure inside your head It doesn't get get lost in its importance in that way Self-regulation I Mean it's super important to see Binocular rivalry the two different views. It's what that's the most important thing that's going on here that you know like oh It's it's ugly to think that we're just doing one number of pain and pleasure or whatever it is rather than The grand reviews we have ourselves But they're both true We have to self-regulate we have to decide what what is our defining goal And it's it's we we have to decide but I've just said we don't have to decide because it's given and It's in it and it's in us, but we don't know what it is and besides It's it's there's many senses in which the values are more important than the rewards I mean the rewards are the ultimate determination But the values are what the consequences of that that come about in interaction with the world In interaction with the world, I figure out that the thing I need to do in order to get the most reward I Have to figure that out The fact that the rewards are fixed doesn't help me Doesn't inform me about what what I should do in the world to decide what to do in the world and what I should Say to myself and say to others is my goal That will be all about value and values come by Through the complex interaction with the world and what is what is actually going to make me happier in the long run? You know the rewards can't tell you that the words just tell you when you get there I'll tell you if you're happy or not They can't tell you what you should do and they can't tell you so you have to decide You know which which career to have and and which person to be involved in and all those Subtle hard decisions. It doesn't the fact that it's fixed doesn't help me make those decisions. You still have to do those I Think I probably also will and I'm looking at the clock will also only address part of your question but um, I do think reward hacking occurs and people I think addiction is kind of the edge case of that But I'm wondering whether you would also find there's a philosophical literature Maybe just one philosophical author On this idea of value capture and so I think one of the examples given in the phenomenon value capture is people wear like a Fitbit And the Fitbit tracks the number of steps that you take and obviously you need to take steps in order to maintain your health or like whatever the man tries to tell you and I'm just kidding. It's probably important and But people become obsessed With getting their steps. They're like they if they go for a walk and they don't have their Fitbit It didn't count and that's an example of value capture. That's obviously like a very Sort of relatively cute example of value capture, but I think this is something that happens like Professionally, right? It happens like if we have certain goals like, you know, the pursuit of knowledge or contributing to something, you know But we value capture in in publications or whatever, you know, lots of cases across not just an academic phenomenon This is something that happens Across different aspects of human life. I don't know if that's exactly what you're getting at but In terms of self-regulation, I think understanding again the understanding is extremely powerful because if you recognize what's happening You can regulate around that. So I think just based on our conversation a little bit yesterday based on your interest I think I wonder I was wondering whether value capture might be something that you're also interested in looking at Which is just a kind of nuanced version of how that happens in everyday life, I think Thank you. Well, this is we are we are at two hours folks.
