0	6000	Again and again, Spongebob Squarepants, I believe, is called, and we're selling here at $180,000.
6000	9000	We're understanding that art is no longer a collectible.
9000	14000	It is an alternative asset class, and it can produce significant investment returns.
14000	18000	Our view is really that this is an investable asset class.
18000	23000	You should think of it just like you think of stocks, fixed income, any other asset class.
23000	27000	What's wrong with making a little money off of buying and selling art?
27000	30000	Surely you're supporting the artist, right?
30000	32000	And that will make the art better, right?
32000	34000	Right?
34000	38000	Well, not exactly, but I'll get into that.
38000	43000	What's important that you know right now is that things have not always been this way.
43000	47000	It's only really been since around 2004.
47000	51000	The world of investment took serious interest in the art world,
51000	55000	and the results have been disastrous.
57000	60000	The world of investment took serious interest in the art world,
60000	63000	and the results have been disastrous.
63000	67000	The world of investment took serious interest in the art world,
67000	70000	and the results have been disastrous.
70000	74000	The world of investment took serious interest in the art world,
74000	77000	and the results have been disastrous.
77000	81000	The world of investment took serious interest in the art world,
81000	84000	and the results have been disastrous.
84000	88000	The world of investment took serious interest in the art world,
88000	91000	and the results have been disastrous.
91000	95000	The world of investment took serious interest in the art world,
95000	98000	and the results have been disastrous.
98000	102000	The world of investment took serious interest in the art world,
102000	105000	and the results have been disastrous.
105000	109000	The world of investment took serious interest in the art world,
109000	112000	and the results have been disastrous.
139000	143000	Art is a dynamic form of human expression,
143000	146000	which can manifest itself in a wide array of mediums
146000	150000	from paint on a canvas to a repurposed urinal,
150000	153000	signed r.mut.
153000	156000	Art means a lot of different things to a lot of different people.
156000	159000	In fact, it's not even exclusive to people as we know them.
159000	162000	Art is a dynamic form of human expression,
162000	165000	which can manifest itself in a wide array of mediums
165000	168000	from paint on a canvas to a repurposed urinal,
168000	170000	and we know them.
170000	174000	In 2018, researchers discovered 64,000-year-old
174000	177000	Neanderthal cave paintings in Andalusia,
177000	180000	broadening our philosophical concept of art
180000	183000	and the human experience as a whole.
183000	187000	At its best, art is a means of communicating
187000	189000	ineffable experiences.
189000	193000	It's revolutionary, profound, expressive, informative.
193000	196000	All-inspiring or just downright amusing.
196000	199000	At its worst, it's a banana taped to the wall.
203000	206000	For this video, I think it's important to define
206000	208000	what art is not.
208000	212000	Art is not an asset class, a commodity,
212000	214000	a percentage of an investment portfolio
214000	217000	to be bought in fractal shares.
217000	219000	That's how I've come to treat art,
219000	222000	because it's something of value and value means money,
222000	225000	and who doesn't need more money?
225000	228000	But let's take a step back to understand
228000	230000	how we got here in the first place.
255000	265000	As far back in history as we can see,
265000	267000	people have been going through great lengths
267000	270000	to surround themselves with things they find beautiful.
270000	273000	Art not only elevates our spirits,
273000	277000	but also allows us to show those we invite into our homes
277000	279000	a little piece of who we are,
279000	283000	or at the very least, start an interesting conversation.
283000	285000	On the darker side of human nature,
285000	288000	collecting art is a symbol of wealth,
288000	291000	status, taste, and erudition.
291000	293000	Having a certain caliber of art
293000	297000	separates the initiated from the unwashed masses.
308000	310000	Art collecting as we know it today
310000	313000	really started around the time of the Renaissance.
313000	315000	The Medici family of Florence
315000	318000	became extremely wealthy through banking
318000	320000	during this period
320000	322000	and spent a fortune on commissioning
322000	325000	some of the most iconic works of art to this day,
325000	327000	including works by Da Vinci,
327000	330000	Paracelli, and Michelangelo.
330000	333000	The tradition of the uber-wealthy
333000	335000	buying and collecting art
335000	339000	has continued much the same to this day.
340000	345000	The act of collecting art
345000	349000	has traditionally been facilitated by the art dealer,
349000	353000	an intermediary between the buyer and seller of art,
353000	356000	or a person or group of people
356000	360000	who buy art hoping to sell it to others at a profit.
360000	364000	Recently, however, the lines between dealer and buyer
364000	366000	have blurred to the point where
366000	369000	most buyers think and behave more like dealers
369000	372000	than lovers of art.
374000	377000	And that brings us to the title of this video.
377000	381000	Art is dead and money killed it.
381000	383000	Not convinced?
383000	385000	Let's take a deeper look.
397000	400000	Art is dead and money killed it.
400000	402000	Not convinced?
402000	404000	Let's take a deeper look.
404000	406000	Art is dead and money killed it.
406000	408000	Not convinced?
408000	410000	Let's take a deeper look.
410000	412000	Art is dead and money killed it.
412000	414000	Not convinced?
414000	416000	Let's take a deeper look.
416000	418000	Art is dead and money killed it.
418000	420000	Not convinced?
420000	422000	Let's take a deeper look.
422000	424000	Art is dead and money killed it.
431000	435000	According to the UBS Global Art Market Report,
435000	440000	the art market was worth 64 billion in 2019,
440000	444000	one and a half the revenue of box office sales,
444000	449000	and more than three times the sales of recorded music.
450000	453000	So art is big business.
453000	455000	Great news for artists, right?
455000	457000	Wrong.
457000	459000	Your average artist is actually getting poorer
459000	461000	as the market booms.
461000	464000	75% of professional artists
464000	467000	earn less than $10,000 a year
467000	469000	from their work
469000	471000	with less than 3%
471000	473000	even managing to earn as much as the average
473000	476000	fast food worker annually from their art.
476000	479000	So where's all the money going?
479000	481000	Over recent years,
481000	484000	it's been increasingly concentrated at the top
484000	487000	with celebrity artists being the safest bet
487000	490000	for an investor looking for a return
490000	492000	on a piece of art.
496000	498000	Sales over 10 million
498000	501000	make up a fraction of 1%
501000	503000	of total art transactions,
503000	505000	yet represent 28%
505000	508000	of that 64 billion I mentioned earlier.
508000	510000	Smaller artists
510000	512000	are getting more exposure than ever before
512000	514000	thanks to social media,
514000	516000	but the sad truth is the art market today
516000	519000	is not interested in the quality of the work
519000	522000	as much as the name behind it.
522000	524000	And those artists at the top
524000	526000	are being encouraged to overproduce
526000	529000	as well as produce on-brand works,
529000	532000	which are safer investments for potential buyers.
532000	534000	Essentially stifling creativity
534000	536000	and experimentation in an industry
536000	539000	built on creativity and experimentation.
543000	545000	Big money investing
545000	548000	is literally killing art.
554000	556000	There's very little magic
556000	558000	in the creation of this art either.
558000	560000	Artist studios are incorporated
560000	562000	and registered as companies
562000	564000	with teams of assistants
564000	566000	pumping out works of art like a factory.
566000	568000	These studios behave
568000	570000	like companies as well,
570000	572000	needing to turn over millions of dollars
572000	574000	in profits a year
574000	576000	just to sustain themselves.
576000	578000	Galleries are no different.
578000	580000	Demanding more work from artists
580000	582000	and almost never questioning
582000	584000	the quality or significance
584000	586000	of the works they are buying,
586000	588000	simply assessing how much of a return
588000	590000	they might get for it.
595000	597000	China has recently entered the art market
597000	599000	in a big way.
599000	601000	For many of China's super wealthy,
601000	604000	buying art with a newsworthy price tag
604000	606000	is a great way to show that you've arrived
606000	608000	economically speed.
609000	611000	The bigger the price tag, the better.
611000	614000	The work itself could matter less.
614000	617000	It's not all about flexing though.
617000	619000	Due to laws put in place
619000	621000	by the Chinese government
621000	623000	to prevent the devaluation of the Yuan,
623000	625000	buying art and selling it overseas
625000	627000	is one of the best ways
627000	629000	to get substantial sums of money
629000	631000	out of mainland China.
631000	633000	Art museums are also increasingly
633000	635000	part of the real estate projects
635000	637000	in mainland China.
637000	639000	In an attempt to draw attention to the project,
639000	641000	as well as qualifying developers
641000	643000	for special discounts on buying land
643000	645000	from the government.
646000	648000	Art's ability to be bought
648000	650000	in one currency and sold in another,
650000	652000	and its relative mobility
652000	654000	compared to say real estate,
654000	656000	makes it an extremely attractive
656000	658000	store of wealth.
658000	661000	This has led to the rise of free ports,
661000	663000	where art is essentially stowed away
663000	665000	in strong boxes,
665000	668000	tax free, and customs duty free.
668000	670000	Works can be bought and sold
670000	672000	over and over without ever being
672000	675000	taxed as long as it remains in the free port.
678000	680000	If all of that sounded shady to you,
680000	683000	that's only the legal side of things.
683000	686000	I'm not even getting into money laundering,
686000	690000	which itself is a huge industry in art.
694000	696000	Today's art market has transformed
696000	698000	into a dull, dispassionate
698000	700000	alternative investment,
700000	702000	with gallery owners noting that their customers
702000	705000	are less and less eccentric art lovers
705000	708000	and more often cold, rational investors
708000	711000	with no interest in art.
730000	745000	Music
745000	747000	There has been a notable shift
747000	749000	in the past 15 years
749000	751000	in how we appreciate art.
751000	753000	Social media has shifted the focus
753000	756000	from the artwork to the art viewer,
756000	758000	putting yourself in the center stage
758000	761000	with the art serving as a mere pretty backdrop
761000	764000	for your Instagram picture.
764000	766000	It may seem harmless,
766000	769000	but this trend has actually had a significant impact
769000	771000	on what modern art looks like.
771000	773000	Art installations have shifted
773000	776000	from works to be marveled at and pondered on,
776000	779000	to experiences to be photographed.
784000	786000	The success of installations,
786000	789000	such as Infinity Mirrors by Yayoi Kusama
789000	792000	and The Rain Room by Hannes Koch
792000	794000	has led to the creation
794000	797000	of an entire pop-up exhibits,
797000	799000	such as the Museum of Ice Cream
799000	801000	and the Color Factory,
801000	803000	designed for the specific purpose
803000	806000	of being the backdrop of your new profile pic.
813000	815000	In a narcissistic society,
815000	818000	any product, such as art,
818000	821000	is simply a tool to enhance the status of the user.
821000	824000	The experience of visiting an art museum
824000	827000	or exhibit has become the soulless pursuit
827000	829000	of the perfect picture,
829000	831000	with little room for reflection
831000	834000	or appreciation of the art of this play.
842000	844000	I guess it begs the question,
844000	848000	do we the consumer even deserve creations of true genius?
848000	852000	Would we overlook pieces of truly challenging art
852000	854000	to line up for a cheeky selfie
854000	857000	with an uninspired work made for Instagram?
857000	860000	Do we even have the attention span
860000	862000	to stand still long enough
862000	864000	to be moved by a piece of art?
869000	871000	Can we blame the art industry
871000	873000	for selling out to the bankers
873000	876000	when we, the consumer, are too self-obsessed
876000	879000	to see art as more than a backdrop for a photo?
885000	887000	The fact of the matter is,
887000	890000	we're all guilty of taking genius works of art for granted,
890000	892000	looking over minute details
892000	896000	painstakingly made by artists devoted to their craft.
896000	898000	We care more about the glamour
898000	901000	and celebrity personality behind the work of art
901000	904000	than we care about the state of the art world
904000	906000	and where it's headed.
907000	909000	When are we going to get bored
909000	912000	with the shallow vapid experiences
912000	915000	and just sit still and genuinely admire something?
916000	919000	The academic side of art is shunned and dismissed
919000	921000	as pretentious,
921000	924000	while new artists and art consumer
924000	927000	proudly towering having no foundation
927000	929000	in their appreciation of art.
929000	931000	Visceral reactions are powerful,
931000	934000	both without an understanding of the significance of a work.
934000	937000	They often ring hollow.
937000	942000	We, the consumer of art, need to do better.
959000	983000	I hope all that doom and gloom didn't put you off to this message,
983000	987000	because ultimately, this is a message of hope for greatness.
987000	991000	Looking at the inner workings of the modern art market,
991000	995000	it's hard not to conclude that art is dead,
995000	998000	but that would be ignoring all the lesser-known artists
998000	1000000	devoted to their craft,
1000000	1005000	putting their heart into creating meaningful works of passion.
1005000	1009000	They likely won't make headlines for an eight-figure sale
1009000	1013000	or find their way onto a t-shirt at Urban Outfitters.
1013000	1017000	They may never even make it into an exhibit or gallery,
1017000	1022000	but I challenge you to value their work like it's the Mona Lisa.
1022000	1027000	Seek out art that challenges you and let it move you.
1027000	1029000	Support small artists,
1029000	1034000	and we can build our own art market separate from the billionaires.
1034000	1037000	Instead of decorating your room with posters of art
1037000	1039000	that sold for millions,
1039000	1043000	buy original art from artists you like,
1043000	1045000	but may not be well-known.
1045000	1050000	There's so much greatness in the world that goes unnoticed or unappreciated.
1050000	1053000	Make it a point to recognize it when you see it.
1053000	1056000	Educate yourself on art history,
1056000	1059000	and build a foundation for deeper art appreciation.
1059000	1061000	That's the mission of this channel.
1061000	1063000	That's the message of hope.
1063000	1065000	Art is not dead.
1065000	1069000	It lives on in that friend who's passionate about painting,
1069000	1071000	but can't manage to turn it into a career.
1071000	1073000	It lives in that art teacher,
1073000	1075000	or art history professor,
1075000	1078000	who passionately teaches you the foundations.
1078000	1081000	And I hope it lives on this channel as well.
1086000	1089000	Do not go gentle into that good night.
1089000	1091000	Rage.
1091000	1094000	Rage against the dying loop of life.
1095000	1098000	Rage against the dying loop of life.
1098000	1101000	Rage against the dying loop of life.
1101000	1104000	Rage against the dying loop of life.
1104000	1107000	Rage against the dying loop of life.
1107000	1110000	Rage against the dying loop of life.
