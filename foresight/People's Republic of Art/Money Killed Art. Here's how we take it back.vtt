00:00.000 --> 00:06.000
Again and again, Spongebob Squarepants, I believe, is called, and we're selling here at $180,000.

00:06.000 --> 00:09.000
We're understanding that art is no longer a collectible.

00:09.000 --> 00:14.000
It is an alternative asset class, and it can produce significant investment returns.

00:14.000 --> 00:18.000
Our view is really that this is an investable asset class.

00:18.000 --> 00:23.000
You should think of it just like you think of stocks, fixed income, any other asset class.

00:23.000 --> 00:27.000
What's wrong with making a little money off of buying and selling art?

00:27.000 --> 00:30.000
Surely you're supporting the artist, right?

00:30.000 --> 00:32.000
And that will make the art better, right?

00:32.000 --> 00:34.000
Right?

00:34.000 --> 00:38.000
Well, not exactly, but I'll get into that.

00:38.000 --> 00:43.000
What's important that you know right now is that things have not always been this way.

00:43.000 --> 00:47.000
It's only really been since around 2004.

00:47.000 --> 00:51.000
The world of investment took serious interest in the art world,

00:51.000 --> 00:55.000
and the results have been disastrous.

00:57.000 --> 01:00.000
The world of investment took serious interest in the art world,

01:00.000 --> 01:03.000
and the results have been disastrous.

01:03.000 --> 01:07.000
The world of investment took serious interest in the art world,

01:07.000 --> 01:10.000
and the results have been disastrous.

01:10.000 --> 01:14.000
The world of investment took serious interest in the art world,

01:14.000 --> 01:17.000
and the results have been disastrous.

01:17.000 --> 01:21.000
The world of investment took serious interest in the art world,

01:21.000 --> 01:24.000
and the results have been disastrous.

01:24.000 --> 01:28.000
The world of investment took serious interest in the art world,

01:28.000 --> 01:31.000
and the results have been disastrous.

01:31.000 --> 01:35.000
The world of investment took serious interest in the art world,

01:35.000 --> 01:38.000
and the results have been disastrous.

01:38.000 --> 01:42.000
The world of investment took serious interest in the art world,

01:42.000 --> 01:45.000
and the results have been disastrous.

01:45.000 --> 01:49.000
The world of investment took serious interest in the art world,

01:49.000 --> 01:52.000
and the results have been disastrous.

02:19.000 --> 02:23.000
Art is a dynamic form of human expression,

02:23.000 --> 02:26.000
which can manifest itself in a wide array of mediums

02:26.000 --> 02:30.000
from paint on a canvas to a repurposed urinal,

02:30.000 --> 02:33.000
signed r.mut.

02:33.000 --> 02:36.000
Art means a lot of different things to a lot of different people.

02:36.000 --> 02:39.000
In fact, it's not even exclusive to people as we know them.

02:39.000 --> 02:42.000
Art is a dynamic form of human expression,

02:42.000 --> 02:45.000
which can manifest itself in a wide array of mediums

02:45.000 --> 02:48.000
from paint on a canvas to a repurposed urinal,

02:48.000 --> 02:50.000
and we know them.

02:50.000 --> 02:54.000
In 2018, researchers discovered 64,000-year-old

02:54.000 --> 02:57.000
Neanderthal cave paintings in Andalusia,

02:57.000 --> 03:00.000
broadening our philosophical concept of art

03:00.000 --> 03:03.000
and the human experience as a whole.

03:03.000 --> 03:07.000
At its best, art is a means of communicating

03:07.000 --> 03:09.000
ineffable experiences.

03:09.000 --> 03:13.000
It's revolutionary, profound, expressive, informative.

03:13.000 --> 03:16.000
All-inspiring or just downright amusing.

03:16.000 --> 03:19.000
At its worst, it's a banana taped to the wall.

03:23.000 --> 03:26.000
For this video, I think it's important to define

03:26.000 --> 03:28.000
what art is not.

03:28.000 --> 03:32.000
Art is not an asset class, a commodity,

03:32.000 --> 03:34.000
a percentage of an investment portfolio

03:34.000 --> 03:37.000
to be bought in fractal shares.

03:37.000 --> 03:39.000
That's how I've come to treat art,

03:39.000 --> 03:42.000
because it's something of value and value means money,

03:42.000 --> 03:45.000
and who doesn't need more money?

03:45.000 --> 03:48.000
But let's take a step back to understand

03:48.000 --> 03:50.000
how we got here in the first place.

04:15.000 --> 04:25.000
As far back in history as we can see,

04:25.000 --> 04:27.000
people have been going through great lengths

04:27.000 --> 04:30.000
to surround themselves with things they find beautiful.

04:30.000 --> 04:33.000
Art not only elevates our spirits,

04:33.000 --> 04:37.000
but also allows us to show those we invite into our homes

04:37.000 --> 04:39.000
a little piece of who we are,

04:39.000 --> 04:43.000
or at the very least, start an interesting conversation.

04:43.000 --> 04:45.000
On the darker side of human nature,

04:45.000 --> 04:48.000
collecting art is a symbol of wealth,

04:48.000 --> 04:51.000
status, taste, and erudition.

04:51.000 --> 04:53.000
Having a certain caliber of art

04:53.000 --> 04:57.000
separates the initiated from the unwashed masses.

05:08.000 --> 05:10.000
Art collecting as we know it today

05:10.000 --> 05:13.000
really started around the time of the Renaissance.

05:13.000 --> 05:15.000
The Medici family of Florence

05:15.000 --> 05:18.000
became extremely wealthy through banking

05:18.000 --> 05:20.000
during this period

05:20.000 --> 05:22.000
and spent a fortune on commissioning

05:22.000 --> 05:25.000
some of the most iconic works of art to this day,

05:25.000 --> 05:27.000
including works by Da Vinci,

05:27.000 --> 05:30.000
Paracelli, and Michelangelo.

05:30.000 --> 05:33.000
The tradition of the uber-wealthy

05:33.000 --> 05:35.000
buying and collecting art

05:35.000 --> 05:39.000
has continued much the same to this day.

05:40.000 --> 05:45.000
The act of collecting art

05:45.000 --> 05:49.000
has traditionally been facilitated by the art dealer,

05:49.000 --> 05:53.000
an intermediary between the buyer and seller of art,

05:53.000 --> 05:56.000
or a person or group of people

05:56.000 --> 06:00.000
who buy art hoping to sell it to others at a profit.

06:00.000 --> 06:04.000
Recently, however, the lines between dealer and buyer

06:04.000 --> 06:06.000
have blurred to the point where

06:06.000 --> 06:09.000
most buyers think and behave more like dealers

06:09.000 --> 06:12.000
than lovers of art.

06:14.000 --> 06:17.000
And that brings us to the title of this video.

06:17.000 --> 06:21.000
Art is dead and money killed it.

06:21.000 --> 06:23.000
Not convinced?

06:23.000 --> 06:25.000
Let's take a deeper look.

06:37.000 --> 06:40.000
Art is dead and money killed it.

06:40.000 --> 06:42.000
Not convinced?

06:42.000 --> 06:44.000
Let's take a deeper look.

06:44.000 --> 06:46.000
Art is dead and money killed it.

06:46.000 --> 06:48.000
Not convinced?

06:48.000 --> 06:50.000
Let's take a deeper look.

06:50.000 --> 06:52.000
Art is dead and money killed it.

06:52.000 --> 06:54.000
Not convinced?

06:54.000 --> 06:56.000
Let's take a deeper look.

06:56.000 --> 06:58.000
Art is dead and money killed it.

06:58.000 --> 07:00.000
Not convinced?

07:00.000 --> 07:02.000
Let's take a deeper look.

07:02.000 --> 07:04.000
Art is dead and money killed it.

07:11.000 --> 07:15.000
According to the UBS Global Art Market Report,

07:15.000 --> 07:20.000
the art market was worth 64 billion in 2019,

07:20.000 --> 07:24.000
one and a half the revenue of box office sales,

07:24.000 --> 07:29.000
and more than three times the sales of recorded music.

07:30.000 --> 07:33.000
So art is big business.

07:33.000 --> 07:35.000
Great news for artists, right?

07:35.000 --> 07:37.000
Wrong.

07:37.000 --> 07:39.000
Your average artist is actually getting poorer

07:39.000 --> 07:41.000
as the market booms.

07:41.000 --> 07:44.000
75% of professional artists

07:44.000 --> 07:47.000
earn less than $10,000 a year

07:47.000 --> 07:49.000
from their work

07:49.000 --> 07:51.000
with less than 3%

07:51.000 --> 07:53.000
even managing to earn as much as the average

07:53.000 --> 07:56.000
fast food worker annually from their art.

07:56.000 --> 07:59.000
So where's all the money going?

07:59.000 --> 08:01.000
Over recent years,

08:01.000 --> 08:04.000
it's been increasingly concentrated at the top

08:04.000 --> 08:07.000
with celebrity artists being the safest bet

08:07.000 --> 08:10.000
for an investor looking for a return

08:10.000 --> 08:12.000
on a piece of art.

08:16.000 --> 08:18.000
Sales over 10 million

08:18.000 --> 08:21.000
make up a fraction of 1%

08:21.000 --> 08:23.000
of total art transactions,

08:23.000 --> 08:25.000
yet represent 28%

08:25.000 --> 08:28.000
of that 64 billion I mentioned earlier.

08:28.000 --> 08:30.000
Smaller artists

08:30.000 --> 08:32.000
are getting more exposure than ever before

08:32.000 --> 08:34.000
thanks to social media,

08:34.000 --> 08:36.000
but the sad truth is the art market today

08:36.000 --> 08:39.000
is not interested in the quality of the work

08:39.000 --> 08:42.000
as much as the name behind it.

08:42.000 --> 08:44.000
And those artists at the top

08:44.000 --> 08:46.000
are being encouraged to overproduce

08:46.000 --> 08:49.000
as well as produce on-brand works,

08:49.000 --> 08:52.000
which are safer investments for potential buyers.

08:52.000 --> 08:54.000
Essentially stifling creativity

08:54.000 --> 08:56.000
and experimentation in an industry

08:56.000 --> 08:59.000
built on creativity and experimentation.

09:03.000 --> 09:05.000
Big money investing

09:05.000 --> 09:08.000
is literally killing art.

09:14.000 --> 09:16.000
There's very little magic

09:16.000 --> 09:18.000
in the creation of this art either.

09:18.000 --> 09:20.000
Artist studios are incorporated

09:20.000 --> 09:22.000
and registered as companies

09:22.000 --> 09:24.000
with teams of assistants

09:24.000 --> 09:26.000
pumping out works of art like a factory.

09:26.000 --> 09:28.000
These studios behave

09:28.000 --> 09:30.000
like companies as well,

09:30.000 --> 09:32.000
needing to turn over millions of dollars

09:32.000 --> 09:34.000
in profits a year

09:34.000 --> 09:36.000
just to sustain themselves.

09:36.000 --> 09:38.000
Galleries are no different.

09:38.000 --> 09:40.000
Demanding more work from artists

09:40.000 --> 09:42.000
and almost never questioning

09:42.000 --> 09:44.000
the quality or significance

09:44.000 --> 09:46.000
of the works they are buying,

09:46.000 --> 09:48.000
simply assessing how much of a return

09:48.000 --> 09:50.000
they might get for it.

09:55.000 --> 09:57.000
China has recently entered the art market

09:57.000 --> 09:59.000
in a big way.

09:59.000 --> 10:01.000
For many of China's super wealthy,

10:01.000 --> 10:04.000
buying art with a newsworthy price tag

10:04.000 --> 10:06.000
is a great way to show that you've arrived

10:06.000 --> 10:08.000
economically speed.

10:09.000 --> 10:11.000
The bigger the price tag, the better.

10:11.000 --> 10:14.000
The work itself could matter less.

10:14.000 --> 10:17.000
It's not all about flexing though.

10:17.000 --> 10:19.000
Due to laws put in place

10:19.000 --> 10:21.000
by the Chinese government

10:21.000 --> 10:23.000
to prevent the devaluation of the Yuan,

10:23.000 --> 10:25.000
buying art and selling it overseas

10:25.000 --> 10:27.000
is one of the best ways

10:27.000 --> 10:29.000
to get substantial sums of money

10:29.000 --> 10:31.000
out of mainland China.

10:31.000 --> 10:33.000
Art museums are also increasingly

10:33.000 --> 10:35.000
part of the real estate projects

10:35.000 --> 10:37.000
in mainland China.

10:37.000 --> 10:39.000
In an attempt to draw attention to the project,

10:39.000 --> 10:41.000
as well as qualifying developers

10:41.000 --> 10:43.000
for special discounts on buying land

10:43.000 --> 10:45.000
from the government.

10:46.000 --> 10:48.000
Art's ability to be bought

10:48.000 --> 10:50.000
in one currency and sold in another,

10:50.000 --> 10:52.000
and its relative mobility

10:52.000 --> 10:54.000
compared to say real estate,

10:54.000 --> 10:56.000
makes it an extremely attractive

10:56.000 --> 10:58.000
store of wealth.

10:58.000 --> 11:01.000
This has led to the rise of free ports,

11:01.000 --> 11:03.000
where art is essentially stowed away

11:03.000 --> 11:05.000
in strong boxes,

11:05.000 --> 11:08.000
tax free, and customs duty free.

11:08.000 --> 11:10.000
Works can be bought and sold

11:10.000 --> 11:12.000
over and over without ever being

11:12.000 --> 11:15.000
taxed as long as it remains in the free port.

11:18.000 --> 11:20.000
If all of that sounded shady to you,

11:20.000 --> 11:23.000
that's only the legal side of things.

11:23.000 --> 11:26.000
I'm not even getting into money laundering,

11:26.000 --> 11:30.000
which itself is a huge industry in art.

11:34.000 --> 11:36.000
Today's art market has transformed

11:36.000 --> 11:38.000
into a dull, dispassionate

11:38.000 --> 11:40.000
alternative investment,

11:40.000 --> 11:42.000
with gallery owners noting that their customers

11:42.000 --> 11:45.000
are less and less eccentric art lovers

11:45.000 --> 11:48.000
and more often cold, rational investors

11:48.000 --> 11:51.000
with no interest in art.

12:10.000 --> 12:25.000
Music

12:25.000 --> 12:27.000
There has been a notable shift

12:27.000 --> 12:29.000
in the past 15 years

12:29.000 --> 12:31.000
in how we appreciate art.

12:31.000 --> 12:33.000
Social media has shifted the focus

12:33.000 --> 12:36.000
from the artwork to the art viewer,

12:36.000 --> 12:38.000
putting yourself in the center stage

12:38.000 --> 12:41.000
with the art serving as a mere pretty backdrop

12:41.000 --> 12:44.000
for your Instagram picture.

12:44.000 --> 12:46.000
It may seem harmless,

12:46.000 --> 12:49.000
but this trend has actually had a significant impact

12:49.000 --> 12:51.000
on what modern art looks like.

12:51.000 --> 12:53.000
Art installations have shifted

12:53.000 --> 12:56.000
from works to be marveled at and pondered on,

12:56.000 --> 12:59.000
to experiences to be photographed.

13:04.000 --> 13:06.000
The success of installations,

13:06.000 --> 13:09.000
such as Infinity Mirrors by Yayoi Kusama

13:09.000 --> 13:12.000
and The Rain Room by Hannes Koch

13:12.000 --> 13:14.000
has led to the creation

13:14.000 --> 13:17.000
of an entire pop-up exhibits,

13:17.000 --> 13:19.000
such as the Museum of Ice Cream

13:19.000 --> 13:21.000
and the Color Factory,

13:21.000 --> 13:23.000
designed for the specific purpose

13:23.000 --> 13:26.000
of being the backdrop of your new profile pic.

13:33.000 --> 13:35.000
In a narcissistic society,

13:35.000 --> 13:38.000
any product, such as art,

13:38.000 --> 13:41.000
is simply a tool to enhance the status of the user.

13:41.000 --> 13:44.000
The experience of visiting an art museum

13:44.000 --> 13:47.000
or exhibit has become the soulless pursuit

13:47.000 --> 13:49.000
of the perfect picture,

13:49.000 --> 13:51.000
with little room for reflection

13:51.000 --> 13:54.000
or appreciation of the art of this play.

14:02.000 --> 14:04.000
I guess it begs the question,

14:04.000 --> 14:08.000
do we the consumer even deserve creations of true genius?

14:08.000 --> 14:12.000
Would we overlook pieces of truly challenging art

14:12.000 --> 14:14.000
to line up for a cheeky selfie

14:14.000 --> 14:17.000
with an uninspired work made for Instagram?

14:17.000 --> 14:20.000
Do we even have the attention span

14:20.000 --> 14:22.000
to stand still long enough

14:22.000 --> 14:24.000
to be moved by a piece of art?

14:29.000 --> 14:31.000
Can we blame the art industry

14:31.000 --> 14:33.000
for selling out to the bankers

14:33.000 --> 14:36.000
when we, the consumer, are too self-obsessed

14:36.000 --> 14:39.000
to see art as more than a backdrop for a photo?

14:45.000 --> 14:47.000
The fact of the matter is,

14:47.000 --> 14:50.000
we're all guilty of taking genius works of art for granted,

14:50.000 --> 14:52.000
looking over minute details

14:52.000 --> 14:56.000
painstakingly made by artists devoted to their craft.

14:56.000 --> 14:58.000
We care more about the glamour

14:58.000 --> 15:01.000
and celebrity personality behind the work of art

15:01.000 --> 15:04.000
than we care about the state of the art world

15:04.000 --> 15:06.000
and where it's headed.

15:07.000 --> 15:09.000
When are we going to get bored

15:09.000 --> 15:12.000
with the shallow vapid experiences

15:12.000 --> 15:15.000
and just sit still and genuinely admire something?

15:16.000 --> 15:19.000
The academic side of art is shunned and dismissed

15:19.000 --> 15:21.000
as pretentious,

15:21.000 --> 15:24.000
while new artists and art consumer

15:24.000 --> 15:27.000
proudly towering having no foundation

15:27.000 --> 15:29.000
in their appreciation of art.

15:29.000 --> 15:31.000
Visceral reactions are powerful,

15:31.000 --> 15:34.000
both without an understanding of the significance of a work.

15:34.000 --> 15:37.000
They often ring hollow.

15:37.000 --> 15:42.000
We, the consumer of art, need to do better.

15:59.000 --> 16:23.000
I hope all that doom and gloom didn't put you off to this message,

16:23.000 --> 16:27.000
because ultimately, this is a message of hope for greatness.

16:27.000 --> 16:31.000
Looking at the inner workings of the modern art market,

16:31.000 --> 16:35.000
it's hard not to conclude that art is dead,

16:35.000 --> 16:38.000
but that would be ignoring all the lesser-known artists

16:38.000 --> 16:40.000
devoted to their craft,

16:40.000 --> 16:45.000
putting their heart into creating meaningful works of passion.

16:45.000 --> 16:49.000
They likely won't make headlines for an eight-figure sale

16:49.000 --> 16:53.000
or find their way onto a t-shirt at Urban Outfitters.

16:53.000 --> 16:57.000
They may never even make it into an exhibit or gallery,

16:57.000 --> 17:02.000
but I challenge you to value their work like it's the Mona Lisa.

17:02.000 --> 17:07.000
Seek out art that challenges you and let it move you.

17:07.000 --> 17:09.000
Support small artists,

17:09.000 --> 17:14.000
and we can build our own art market separate from the billionaires.

17:14.000 --> 17:17.000
Instead of decorating your room with posters of art

17:17.000 --> 17:19.000
that sold for millions,

17:19.000 --> 17:23.000
buy original art from artists you like,

17:23.000 --> 17:25.000
but may not be well-known.

17:25.000 --> 17:30.000
There's so much greatness in the world that goes unnoticed or unappreciated.

17:30.000 --> 17:33.000
Make it a point to recognize it when you see it.

17:33.000 --> 17:36.000
Educate yourself on art history,

17:36.000 --> 17:39.000
and build a foundation for deeper art appreciation.

17:39.000 --> 17:41.000
That's the mission of this channel.

17:41.000 --> 17:43.000
That's the message of hope.

17:43.000 --> 17:45.000
Art is not dead.

17:45.000 --> 17:49.000
It lives on in that friend who's passionate about painting,

17:49.000 --> 17:51.000
but can't manage to turn it into a career.

17:51.000 --> 17:53.000
It lives in that art teacher,

17:53.000 --> 17:55.000
or art history professor,

17:55.000 --> 17:58.000
who passionately teaches you the foundations.

17:58.000 --> 18:01.000
And I hope it lives on this channel as well.

18:06.000 --> 18:09.000
Do not go gentle into that good night.

18:09.000 --> 18:11.000
Rage.

18:11.000 --> 18:14.000
Rage against the dying loop of life.

18:15.000 --> 18:18.000
Rage against the dying loop of life.

18:18.000 --> 18:21.000
Rage against the dying loop of life.

18:21.000 --> 18:24.000
Rage against the dying loop of life.

18:24.000 --> 18:27.000
Rage against the dying loop of life.

18:27.000 --> 18:30.000
Rage against the dying loop of life.
