1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Again and again, Spongebob Squarepants, I believe, is called, and we're selling here at $180,000.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
We're understanding that art is no longer a collectible.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:14,000
It is an alternative asset class, and it can produce significant investment returns.

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Our view is really that this is an investable asset class.

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:23,000
You should think of it just like you think of stocks, fixed income, any other asset class.

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,000
What's wrong with making a little money off of buying and selling art?

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Surely you're supporting the artist, right?

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
And that will make the art better, right?

9
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Right?

10
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Well, not exactly, but I'll get into that.

11
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:43,000
What's important that you know right now is that things have not always been this way.

12
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:47,000
It's only really been since around 2004.

13
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:51,000
The world of investment took serious interest in the art world,

14
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,000
and the results have been disastrous.

15
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
The world of investment took serious interest in the art world,

16
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
and the results have been disastrous.

17
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,000
The world of investment took serious interest in the art world,

18
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
and the results have been disastrous.

19
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,000
The world of investment took serious interest in the art world,

20
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
and the results have been disastrous.

21
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,000
The world of investment took serious interest in the art world,

22
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
and the results have been disastrous.

23
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,000
The world of investment took serious interest in the art world,

24
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,000
and the results have been disastrous.

25
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:35,000
The world of investment took serious interest in the art world,

26
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
and the results have been disastrous.

27
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,000
The world of investment took serious interest in the art world,

28
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
and the results have been disastrous.

29
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:49,000
The world of investment took serious interest in the art world,

30
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,000
and the results have been disastrous.

31
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Art is a dynamic form of human expression,

32
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
which can manifest itself in a wide array of mediums

33
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:30,000
from paint on a canvas to a repurposed urinal,

34
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
signed r.mut.

35
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Art means a lot of different things to a lot of different people.

36
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
In fact, it's not even exclusive to people as we know them.

37
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Art is a dynamic form of human expression,

38
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,000
which can manifest itself in a wide array of mediums

39
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,000
from paint on a canvas to a repurposed urinal,

40
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
and we know them.

41
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,000
In 2018, researchers discovered 64,000-year-old

42
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Neanderthal cave paintings in Andalusia,

43
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,000
broadening our philosophical concept of art

44
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,000
and the human experience as a whole.

45
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:07,000
At its best, art is a means of communicating

46
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
ineffable experiences.

47
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:13,000
It's revolutionary, profound, expressive, informative.

48
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,000
All-inspiring or just downright amusing.

49
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,000
At its worst, it's a banana taped to the wall.

50
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,000
For this video, I think it's important to define

51
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
what art is not.

52
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Art is not an asset class, a commodity,

53
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
a percentage of an investment portfolio

54
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,000
to be bought in fractal shares.

55
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
That's how I've come to treat art,

56
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,000
because it's something of value and value means money,

57
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,000
and who doesn't need more money?

58
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,000
But let's take a step back to understand

59
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
how we got here in the first place.

60
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:25,000
As far back in history as we can see,

61
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
people have been going through great lengths

62
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,000
to surround themselves with things they find beautiful.

63
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Art not only elevates our spirits,

64
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:37,000
but also allows us to show those we invite into our homes

65
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
a little piece of who we are,

66
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:43,000
or at the very least, start an interesting conversation.

67
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
On the darker side of human nature,

68
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,000
collecting art is a symbol of wealth,

69
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,000
status, taste, and erudition.

70
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Having a certain caliber of art

71
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:57,000
separates the initiated from the unwashed masses.

72
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Art collecting as we know it today

73
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,000
really started around the time of the Renaissance.

74
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
The Medici family of Florence

75
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,000
became extremely wealthy through banking

76
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
during this period

77
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
and spent a fortune on commissioning

78
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,000
some of the most iconic works of art to this day,

79
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
including works by Da Vinci,

80
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Paracelli, and Michelangelo.

81
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,000
The tradition of the uber-wealthy

82
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
buying and collecting art

83
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:39,000
has continued much the same to this day.

84
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:45,000
The act of collecting art

85
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:49,000
has traditionally been facilitated by the art dealer,

86
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:53,000
an intermediary between the buyer and seller of art,

87
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:56,000
or a person or group of people

88
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:00,000
who buy art hoping to sell it to others at a profit.

89
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Recently, however, the lines between dealer and buyer

90
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
have blurred to the point where

91
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,000
most buyers think and behave more like dealers

92
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,000
than lovers of art.

93
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,000
And that brings us to the title of this video.

94
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Art is dead and money killed it.

95
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Not convinced?

96
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Let's take a deeper look.

97
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Art is dead and money killed it.

98
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Not convinced?

99
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Let's take a deeper look.

100
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Art is dead and money killed it.

101
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Not convinced?

102
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Let's take a deeper look.

103
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Art is dead and money killed it.

104
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Not convinced?

105
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Let's take a deeper look.

106
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Art is dead and money killed it.

107
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Not convinced?

108
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Let's take a deeper look.

109
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Art is dead and money killed it.

110
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:15,000
According to the UBS Global Art Market Report,

111
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:20,000
the art market was worth 64 billion in 2019,

112
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:24,000
one and a half the revenue of box office sales,

113
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:29,000
and more than three times the sales of recorded music.

114
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,000
So art is big business.

115
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Great news for artists, right?

116
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Wrong.

117
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Your average artist is actually getting poorer

118
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
as the market booms.

119
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,000
75% of professional artists

120
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,000
earn less than $10,000 a year

121
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
from their work

122
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
with less than 3%

123
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
even managing to earn as much as the average

124
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:56,000
fast food worker annually from their art.

125
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,000
So where's all the money going?

126
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Over recent years,

127
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:04,000
it's been increasingly concentrated at the top

128
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,000
with celebrity artists being the safest bet

129
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:10,000
for an investor looking for a return

130
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
on a piece of art.

131
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Sales over 10 million

132
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,000
make up a fraction of 1%

133
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
of total art transactions,

134
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
yet represent 28%

135
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:28,000
of that 64 billion I mentioned earlier.

136
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Smaller artists

137
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
are getting more exposure than ever before

138
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
thanks to social media,

139
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
but the sad truth is the art market today

140
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,000
is not interested in the quality of the work

141
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:42,000
as much as the name behind it.

142
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
And those artists at the top

143
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
are being encouraged to overproduce

144
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,000
as well as produce on-brand works,

145
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:52,000
which are safer investments for potential buyers.

146
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Essentially stifling creativity

147
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
and experimentation in an industry

148
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,000
built on creativity and experimentation.

149
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Big money investing

150
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:08,000
is literally killing art.

151
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
There's very little magic

152
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
in the creation of this art either.

153
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Artist studios are incorporated

154
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
and registered as companies

155
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
with teams of assistants

156
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
pumping out works of art like a factory.

157
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
These studios behave

158
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
like companies as well,

159
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
needing to turn over millions of dollars

160
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
in profits a year

161
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
just to sustain themselves.

162
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Galleries are no different.

163
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Demanding more work from artists

164
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
and almost never questioning

165
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
the quality or significance

166
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
of the works they are buying,

167
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
simply assessing how much of a return

168
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
they might get for it.

169
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
China has recently entered the art market

170
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
in a big way.

171
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
For many of China's super wealthy,

172
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,000
buying art with a newsworthy price tag

173
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
is a great way to show that you've arrived

174
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
economically speed.

175
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
The bigger the price tag, the better.

176
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:14,000
The work itself could matter less.

177
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,000
It's not all about flexing though.

178
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Due to laws put in place

179
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
by the Chinese government

180
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
to prevent the devaluation of the Yuan,

181
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
buying art and selling it overseas

182
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
is one of the best ways

183
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
to get substantial sums of money

184
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
out of mainland China.

185
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Art museums are also increasingly

186
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
part of the real estate projects

187
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
in mainland China.

188
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
In an attempt to draw attention to the project,

189
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
as well as qualifying developers

190
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
for special discounts on buying land

191
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
from the government.

192
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Art's ability to be bought

193
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
in one currency and sold in another,

194
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
and its relative mobility

195
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
compared to say real estate,

196
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
makes it an extremely attractive

197
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
store of wealth.

198
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:01,000
This has led to the rise of free ports,

199
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
where art is essentially stowed away

200
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
in strong boxes,

201
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:08,000
tax free, and customs duty free.

202
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Works can be bought and sold

203
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
over and over without ever being

204
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:15,000
taxed as long as it remains in the free port.

205
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
If all of that sounded shady to you,

206
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:23,000
that's only the legal side of things.

207
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:26,000
I'm not even getting into money laundering,

208
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:30,000
which itself is a huge industry in art.

209
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Today's art market has transformed

210
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
into a dull, dispassionate

211
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
alternative investment,

212
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
with gallery owners noting that their customers

213
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,000
are less and less eccentric art lovers

214
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:48,000
and more often cold, rational investors

215
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,000
with no interest in art.

216
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:25,000
Music

217
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
There has been a notable shift

218
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
in the past 15 years

219
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
in how we appreciate art.

220
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
Social media has shifted the focus

221
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:36,000
from the artwork to the art viewer,

222
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
putting yourself in the center stage

223
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,000
with the art serving as a mere pretty backdrop

224
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:44,000
for your Instagram picture.

225
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
It may seem harmless,

226
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:49,000
but this trend has actually had a significant impact

227
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
on what modern art looks like.

228
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
Art installations have shifted

229
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:56,000
from works to be marveled at and pondered on,

230
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:59,000
to experiences to be photographed.

231
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
The success of installations,

232
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,000
such as Infinity Mirrors by Yayoi Kusama

233
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:12,000
and The Rain Room by Hannes Koch

234
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
has led to the creation

235
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:17,000
of an entire pop-up exhibits,

236
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
such as the Museum of Ice Cream

237
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
and the Color Factory,

238
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
designed for the specific purpose

239
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:26,000
of being the backdrop of your new profile pic.

240
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
In a narcissistic society,

241
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:38,000
any product, such as art,

242
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:41,000
is simply a tool to enhance the status of the user.

243
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:44,000
The experience of visiting an art museum

244
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:47,000
or exhibit has become the soulless pursuit

245
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
of the perfect picture,

246
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
with little room for reflection

247
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:54,000
or appreciation of the art of this play.

248
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
I guess it begs the question,

249
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:08,000
do we the consumer even deserve creations of true genius?

250
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:12,000
Would we overlook pieces of truly challenging art

251
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
to line up for a cheeky selfie

252
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:17,000
with an uninspired work made for Instagram?

253
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:20,000
Do we even have the attention span

254
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
to stand still long enough

255
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
to be moved by a piece of art?

256
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
Can we blame the art industry

257
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
for selling out to the bankers

258
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:36,000
when we, the consumer, are too self-obsessed

259
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:39,000
to see art as more than a backdrop for a photo?

260
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
The fact of the matter is,

261
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:50,000
we're all guilty of taking genius works of art for granted,

262
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
looking over minute details

263
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:56,000
painstakingly made by artists devoted to their craft.

264
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
We care more about the glamour

265
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:01,000
and celebrity personality behind the work of art

266
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:04,000
than we care about the state of the art world

267
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
and where it's headed.

268
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
When are we going to get bored

269
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:12,000
with the shallow vapid experiences

270
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:15,000
and just sit still and genuinely admire something?

271
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:19,000
The academic side of art is shunned and dismissed

272
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
as pretentious,

273
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:24,000
while new artists and art consumer

274
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:27,000
proudly towering having no foundation

275
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
in their appreciation of art.

276
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
Visceral reactions are powerful,

277
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:34,000
both without an understanding of the significance of a work.

278
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:37,000
They often ring hollow.

279
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:42,000
We, the consumer of art, need to do better.

280
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:23,000
I hope all that doom and gloom didn't put you off to this message,

281
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:27,000
because ultimately, this is a message of hope for greatness.

282
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:31,000
Looking at the inner workings of the modern art market,

283
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:35,000
it's hard not to conclude that art is dead,

284
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:38,000
but that would be ignoring all the lesser-known artists

285
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
devoted to their craft,

286
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:45,000
putting their heart into creating meaningful works of passion.

287
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:49,000
They likely won't make headlines for an eight-figure sale

288
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:53,000
or find their way onto a t-shirt at Urban Outfitters.

289
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:57,000
They may never even make it into an exhibit or gallery,

290
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:02,000
but I challenge you to value their work like it's the Mona Lisa.

291
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:07,000
Seek out art that challenges you and let it move you.

292
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
Support small artists,

293
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:14,000
and we can build our own art market separate from the billionaires.

294
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:17,000
Instead of decorating your room with posters of art

295
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
that sold for millions,

296
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:23,000
buy original art from artists you like,

297
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
but may not be well-known.

298
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:30,000
There's so much greatness in the world that goes unnoticed or unappreciated.

299
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:33,000
Make it a point to recognize it when you see it.

300
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:36,000
Educate yourself on art history,

301
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:39,000
and build a foundation for deeper art appreciation.

302
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
That's the mission of this channel.

303
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
That's the message of hope.

304
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
Art is not dead.

305
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:49,000
It lives on in that friend who's passionate about painting,

306
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
but can't manage to turn it into a career.

307
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
It lives in that art teacher,

308
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
or art history professor,

309
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:58,000
who passionately teaches you the foundations.

310
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:01,000
And I hope it lives on this channel as well.

311
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:09,000
Do not go gentle into that good night.

312
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
Rage.

313
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:14,000
Rage against the dying loop of life.

314
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:18,000
Rage against the dying loop of life.

315
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:21,000
Rage against the dying loop of life.

316
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:24,000
Rage against the dying loop of life.

317
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:27,000
Rage against the dying loop of life.

318
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:30,000
Rage against the dying loop of life.
