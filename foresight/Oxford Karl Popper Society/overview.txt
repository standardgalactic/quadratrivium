 In this conversation, Dennis W. Juranek and Antonio Vargas discuss the nature of perception and problem-solving, particularly how our internal mental processes compare to external sensory experiences. The discussion touches on the difference between recognizing a familiar object like a bicycle, which becomes an automatic process after learning, and encountering a new or unfamiliar concept that requires active problem-solving and critical thinking.

Dennis argues that both perceiving a bicycle and solving a problem occur within the individual's mind, and thus are qualitatively similar experiences. Antonio acknowledges this but points out that there is a difference in the level of mystery and unfamiliarity involved, especially when first encountering something new.

The conversation also draws parallels between the distinction between perceptual experiences and internal mental processes to the separation between science and philosophy, suggesting that while it's useful to make this distinction in some contexts, it may not be a fundamental one. The dialogue highlights the complexity of human cognition and the interplay between empirical evidence and internal thought processes.

Dennis's talk is appreciated for its depth and the discussion encourages everyone to read his article on Conjection Magazine, which explores these ideas further. The conversation serves as a reminder that our understanding of the world, whether through sensory perception or abstract reasoning, is an intricate process that involves both internal and external elements.
