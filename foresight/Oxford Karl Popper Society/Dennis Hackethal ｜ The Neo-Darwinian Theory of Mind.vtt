WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:11.080
So everyone can hear me then. Good afternoon. I'm very pleased to announce their speaker

00:11.080 --> 00:17.240
today is Dennis Hackenthal, who is a software engineer, artificial intelligence researcher

00:17.240 --> 00:22.680
and author of the book, A Window on Intelligence. And today we'll speak about the role of replicators

00:22.680 --> 00:28.400
in creativity, a topic in which Dennis has written for Conjection Magazine in an article

00:28.400 --> 00:33.280
called The Neodorinian Theory of Mind, which we've linked to on Twitter and which we'll

00:33.280 --> 00:39.280
link to in the video as well. And I should also say that I think Conjection Magazine

00:39.280 --> 00:45.080
is open to pictures from writers, for those of you who are interested in possibly contributing

00:45.080 --> 00:50.960
an article to the website. And in general, I also really recommend checking out Conjection

00:50.960 --> 00:58.200
Magazine, I think is a great initiative. And yeah, with that introduction, I give the floor

00:58.200 --> 01:02.280
to Dennis. Dennis, thanks so much for joining us. And I look forward to your talk.

01:02.280 --> 01:08.400
Hi, I'm glad to be here. It was very nice of you to invite me. And I should also mention

01:08.400 --> 01:11.640
Logan Chipkin, who I think is behind this. So shout out to him as well.

01:11.640 --> 01:14.560
Yeah, shout out to Logan.

01:14.560 --> 01:19.960
Yeah, so I'm here to talk about what I call the Neodorinian Theory of Mind. Before I start,

01:19.960 --> 01:26.160
I should say that to give credit where credit is due, I'm indebted to Karl Popper and David

01:26.200 --> 01:30.320
Deutsch, because without their epistemological work, I could never have thought of what I'm

01:30.320 --> 01:35.200
about to tell you. And also Richard Dawkins, who's influenced my thinking on evolution

01:35.200 --> 01:43.320
quite a bit. And it occurred to me recently that maybe the Neodorinian Theory of the Mind

01:43.320 --> 01:48.440
is much too grand a term. I think maybe it should be called the Neodorinian aspect of

01:48.440 --> 01:52.520
the mind or the Neodorinian approach to the mind or something like that. I think that

01:52.560 --> 01:59.520
would be a better name because I think theories of the mind are a dime a dozen and none of

01:59.520 --> 02:05.440
them work. And otherwise, we could already build AGI, artificial general intelligence.

02:05.440 --> 02:13.680
And so it might be better to choose a smaller name than that. But also there's some construction

02:13.680 --> 02:20.760
going on outside. So apologies if you hear anything, if there's any noise. But yeah.

02:20.800 --> 02:26.120
So the meat of the theory of the approach or whatever you want to call it is very simple.

02:28.680 --> 02:36.320
But it does take just a moment to kind of sneak up on it. And so in the papyrian fashion,

02:36.320 --> 02:43.000
what I'd like to do is I'd like to start with some problems. Some problems that I like to

02:43.000 --> 02:50.600
think that the theory or the approach solves are, for example, one, how does the mind create

02:50.600 --> 02:59.480
new conjectures? Two, how does memory work? Which includes things like why do we forget

02:59.480 --> 03:04.440
things? Why are memories so unreliable? Why do some memories last longer than others? Those

03:04.440 --> 03:12.320
kinds of things. And how did people evolve? And then lastly, I want to give by no means

03:12.320 --> 03:17.200
any theories just some small pointers for why I think we are conscious of some things

03:17.240 --> 03:22.880
and not of others. It's interesting to note that originally I only set out to solve the

03:22.880 --> 03:26.880
problem of how people evolved. And then I later found that this approach also allows me to

03:26.880 --> 03:34.280
solve these other problems. So I only have a few slides. This is the last slide. I'll leave

03:34.280 --> 03:43.360
this open. I want to give, I actually want to start in biology. And then I'll tie this back in

03:43.360 --> 03:48.840
with a mind later on. I promise they're related. And I'd like to talk about the origin of life

03:48.840 --> 03:56.760
for a moment. And many have said that what happened there was so unlikely and incredible. It's

03:56.760 --> 04:03.280
almost too good to be true that that happened. And as far as I understand it, there are still

04:03.280 --> 04:08.760
some mysteries around it, what exactly happened there. But there are some good explanations

04:08.840 --> 04:14.920
that I think give us a pretty good idea of what may have happened. And the theory that I

04:14.920 --> 04:22.680
subscribe to is called the RNA world hypothesis. And the idea is basically that a long, long time

04:22.680 --> 04:29.880
ago when the Earth had just formed, the oceans were still highly chemically active. And there were

04:29.880 --> 04:38.720
molecules forming spontaneously in those oceans and disintegrating. And it was a big mess. It was

04:38.760 --> 04:46.080
a big chaos in this so-called primordial soup. And what some of those molecules were is they were

04:46.120 --> 04:52.040
enzymes, they were chemical catalysts. And what that means is that they were able to, they were,

04:52.040 --> 04:57.560
they were able to cause a change in other molecules, for example, while retaining the ability to cause

04:57.560 --> 05:06.080
those changes again at a later time, they didn't undergo any changes themselves. And what happened

05:06.080 --> 05:14.760
then, so to say, that some of these molecules happened to, to cause chemical reactions that

05:14.800 --> 05:20.840
produced some of their own components. So that in this primordial soup, over time, you would get

05:20.840 --> 05:26.160
more and more of the building blocks of which these molecules themselves were made. And so what

05:26.160 --> 05:32.240
I'm kind of sneaking up on is the role of replication in biological evolution. Because once

05:32.240 --> 05:39.800
these molecules, once these enzymes get targeted enough, it makes sense to call them

05:39.800 --> 05:47.200
replicators, because that is what they end up doing. They create a copy of themselves. So the

05:47.200 --> 05:54.400
idea is that this way, gradually, we get replication happening in the primordial soup. But

05:54.400 --> 06:00.840
this alone isn't enough for evolution to occur. You also need variation in selection. But I think

06:00.840 --> 06:09.000
once you have replication, variation is bound to happen sooner or later, because replication is

06:09.000 --> 06:14.440
not going to be perfect forever. And sooner or later, the replicators are going to make a mistake

06:14.440 --> 06:24.640
during replication. And this is what introduces variants. And what you get then is you have, if

06:24.640 --> 06:30.600
the variant is even fit enough still to keep replicating, what you get then is you have slightly

06:30.600 --> 06:35.520
different kind of replicator. And if that is still able to replicate, now what you're getting is

06:35.520 --> 06:39.800
you're getting two different pockets of this population. One pocket of the population is still

06:39.800 --> 06:46.040
the old replicator, the copies of that replicator. And the new pocket of the population is this new

06:46.040 --> 06:51.680
kind of replicator. And so then the question is, well, which one is better at replicating than

06:52.560 --> 07:00.960
the other? And these differences in the rate of replication is what we call selection. I think

07:00.960 --> 07:08.280
Richard Dawkins in his book, The Selfish Gene, I think he uses the technical term as the non-random

07:08.280 --> 07:17.240
differential reproduction rate or something. And usually, because a replicator is already adapted

07:17.240 --> 07:23.480
to replicating, that means that any variant, if a mutation is going to occur, more often than not,

07:23.480 --> 07:28.960
it's going to be worse at replicating. So usually, you could expect that if the replicator mutates,

07:28.960 --> 07:39.640
the mutant variant is going to have a harder time replicating. Because by definition, this is how

07:39.640 --> 07:45.560
William Paley, I think, defined adaptation, something is adapted to something, for example,

07:45.560 --> 07:49.480
replication, that by definition means that if you make any slight change to it, it's going to get

07:49.480 --> 07:57.960
worse. It's very difficult to get it to make it better. But every now and then, a mutation can

07:57.960 --> 08:05.240
lead to a benefit. And by benefit, I don't mean that there is some well-meaning force in the

08:05.240 --> 08:13.160
biosphere. It just means that it helps the variant spread through the population of replicators at

08:13.160 --> 08:20.760
the expense of its rivals. And I think it's important to keep things simple when it comes to the theory

08:20.760 --> 08:26.360
of evolution. Really, all that the replicator wants to do, I say in scare quotes, it's not a

08:26.360 --> 08:31.880
conscious being, but all the replicator wants to do is spread through the population of replicators.

08:31.880 --> 08:38.600
So it's all it cares about. And sometimes, in service of that goal, complex adaptations can

08:38.600 --> 08:50.440
arise. So I'm going to start tying this back in with the mind now. Carl Popper said that the

08:50.440 --> 08:58.200
information that is stored in such replicators is adapted. And so therefore, it's knowledge.

08:58.840 --> 09:02.680
Adapted information is knowledge. Or maybe that particular phrasing originated with David Deutsch.

09:02.760 --> 09:11.160
And Popper's conjecture is that people also create human knowledge by evolution. So evolution, in

09:11.160 --> 09:18.840
that sense, is not limited to the biosphere. Excuse me. Although there are important differences

09:18.840 --> 09:25.080
between biological evolution and the evolution that occurs in our minds, there are strong parallels

09:25.160 --> 09:32.840
are strong parallels between them. And so Popper offered this analogy of a new conjecture that

09:32.840 --> 09:39.720
people come up with being analogous to the mutation of a gene and criticism being analogous to the

09:39.720 --> 09:46.920
selection of a gene. And the old theories that we derive knowledge from the census, for example,

09:46.920 --> 09:53.480
which is empiricism, or that we create them by extrapolating repeated observations, which is

09:53.480 --> 09:58.840
inductivism, which is completely false, as Popper explained. And instead he argued that we

09:59.560 --> 10:05.480
create knowledge by starting with problems, not with observations, which are conflicts between

10:05.480 --> 10:11.880
ideas as David Deutsch defines them. And then we guess solutions to these problems and we criticize

10:11.880 --> 10:18.440
them until we hopefully come up with a solution that we deem good enough to adopt tentatively.

10:19.480 --> 10:23.000
And this is not only scientific knowledge that grows that way. All human knowledge grows that

10:23.000 --> 10:29.640
way. And an example I like to give is that of losing your keys. If you're not sure where your

10:29.640 --> 10:34.760
keys are, and let's say you need them now because you want to leave, really all you can do is guess

10:34.760 --> 10:41.240
where they might be. So maybe you left them on the kitchen counter. So that is a tentative

10:41.880 --> 10:46.200
solution to the problem. And then you can go look for them there. And if you don't find there,

10:46.200 --> 10:49.560
then you know that your theory was false. And so you have to guess another solution, maybe they're

10:49.560 --> 10:53.640
in your pocket or something. And if you find them there, that's great. Then you've made progress.

10:55.240 --> 11:02.200
So knowledge, even in the most mundane scenarios like that, knowledge grows that way.

11:03.000 --> 11:12.680
And I do think that Popper was right about all of this. And I even like to think of them as the

11:13.560 --> 11:17.480
foremost artificial general intelligence researcher of this time, although I don't think

11:17.480 --> 11:24.200
he would have called himself that. But as should be expected, if we're papyrans and fallibilists,

11:24.200 --> 11:29.000
there are open problems with hispistemology. And these are some of the open problems.

11:29.880 --> 11:35.240
The open problems I mentioned at the beginning are some of those. So just to reiterate them,

11:35.240 --> 11:42.520
those were how does the mind create new conjectures? How does memory work? How did people evolve?

11:43.480 --> 11:45.720
And then the big one is consciousness.

11:51.080 --> 11:58.600
And to solve them, what I would like to suggest is the following, that if we can think of the

11:58.600 --> 12:08.360
biosphere as an arena of self replicating genes, that analogously, we can think of the mind as an

12:08.360 --> 12:13.880
arena of self replicating ideas. Now, having said that there are still many important differences

12:13.880 --> 12:18.200
between the mind and the biosphere, I don't by no means do I want to equivocate those two.

12:19.000 --> 12:22.760
But I do think there are strong parallels that may help us explain some things.

12:23.640 --> 12:33.480
I should also mention, once I say replicating ideas, we may jump to memes, which are Richard

12:33.480 --> 12:40.280
Dawkins idea of the cultural unit of a replicator. Those are not what I mean, just to clarify. Memes

12:40.280 --> 12:46.840
are ideas that replicate across minds. Memes are not just funny pictures on the internet.

12:48.280 --> 12:54.920
It's basically any idea that manages to jump from one mind to another, or at least enough minds that

12:54.920 --> 13:01.960
it becomes meaningful to call it a meme. So a joke is a meme, but also catchy song could be a meme.

13:02.760 --> 13:08.760
And with the example of the joke, I think this is an example David gives in his book.

13:09.480 --> 13:15.800
You know, if the joke is good enough, then it causes the holder, the person who knows the joke,

13:15.800 --> 13:22.440
to tell it to somebody else. And so now the joke is in two minds, not just one. And that's why

13:22.440 --> 13:27.960
it's meaningful to call it a replicator. But again, I'm not talking about memes here. I'm only

13:27.960 --> 13:34.760
talking about ideas that replicate strictly within a single mind. So it can help, I think, to just

13:34.760 --> 13:38.840
think of a mind that's just cut off completely from the outside world to make things easier. So you

13:38.840 --> 13:43.560
can just imagine a brain in a vat, if you like, doesn't have any access to the outside world.

13:43.560 --> 13:48.440
And still, I think there would be self replicating ideas in the mind. It's also a nice way to

13:50.440 --> 13:55.240
make sure that we can't accidentally adopt any empiricist or inductive notions if we just completely

13:55.240 --> 14:04.120
disregard sense data. And so I think with this simple premise that the mind is an arena of

14:04.120 --> 14:13.880
self replicating ideas, we can now start solving the problems that I mentioned. And I think when it

14:13.880 --> 14:23.000
comes to the question of how people evolved, I would say that the evolution of the mind and

14:23.080 --> 14:29.720
the evolution of people is analogous to the origin of life in the biosphere. Because I'd like to

14:29.720 --> 14:35.080
suggest that the evolution of self replicating ideas in a mind happened analogously to the

14:35.080 --> 14:42.280
evolution of self replicating molecules in the primordial soup. And I think what happened is,

14:43.880 --> 14:50.200
well, so this is Popper again, so all organisms contain knowledge in the objective sense,

14:50.920 --> 14:56.520
meaning, for example, wolves know how to hunt in packs and dogs know how to fetch balls, beavers

14:56.520 --> 15:01.640
know how to build dams and so forth. This all takes knowledge. All of these activities have

15:01.640 --> 15:06.920
the appearance of design. So we know that there must be knowledge behind them. And that knowledge

15:06.920 --> 15:12.360
is stored in their genes. And so we could just call the knowledge that results in these behaviors.

15:12.360 --> 15:19.480
We could call those ideas in the objective sense. And the set of all ideas that an organism has,

15:20.200 --> 15:29.400
I call its idea pool. And some of these ideas, I think, act just like the enzymes,

15:29.400 --> 15:36.200
those molecular catalysts from the primordial soup. They're able to make a change in other ideas

15:36.200 --> 15:45.000
within the same organism without undergoing any net change themselves. And in one of our ancestors,

15:45.000 --> 15:51.000
because of a genetic mutation, there was one such idea, one such catalyst, that happened to

15:51.000 --> 15:55.720
promote the production of ideas of which it itself was made. But more technically speaking,

15:55.720 --> 16:00.600
you could say that it happened to promote the production of source code of which it itself was

16:00.600 --> 16:06.440
made. And then the same thing happened that happened in the primordial soup. Whenever that

16:06.440 --> 16:12.440
catalyst happened to become a little more targeted, it produced more of its components more

16:12.520 --> 16:18.040
faithfully, until at some point you could say it was targeted to meaningfully call it a replicator.

16:19.160 --> 16:24.200
Except this time it's not a molecule that self replicates. It's not a material, a physical thing.

16:24.200 --> 16:28.760
It's an abstract thing. It's an idea. And this thing now replicates over and over

16:29.640 --> 16:33.720
during that single organism's lifetime. So in addition to biological evolution that we have

16:33.720 --> 16:38.680
happening, we now have what we could call mental evolution happening during that single organism

16:38.680 --> 16:44.920
lifetime. I also call it runtime, the runtime of that software. And like I said, just like in

16:44.920 --> 16:50.440
the primordial soup, once you have replication, well, replication is not perfect forever. Even

16:50.440 --> 16:55.160
the best replicator makes mistakes every now and then. So sooner or later, variation and selection

16:55.160 --> 17:01.080
will kick in. And that's how you get evolution in the mind. And so that's how you get a dynamically

17:01.080 --> 17:07.400
changing idea pool, much like you have a dynamically changing gene pool in nature.

17:08.360 --> 17:15.000
And this is how this organism can now create new knowledge, knowledge that was not genetically

17:15.000 --> 17:21.800
given. And that's something people do all the time. Everyone in this column is doing it right now.

17:21.800 --> 17:27.880
And I believe that this, what I've laid out is the underlying logic that allows them to do so.

17:28.120 --> 17:33.800
So we've solved now the, I mean, hopefully, we've solved the problem of how people evolved.

17:34.680 --> 17:41.080
And the second problem also, which is where do conjectures come from? I think they're just

17:41.080 --> 17:46.360
the result of a long string of ideas replicating them perfectly, accidentally morphing into a new idea.

17:49.560 --> 17:53.560
And we can also explain now how memory works. Memory,

17:54.280 --> 17:59.960
as with so many things of the mind that are unfortunately explained on the level of the brain,

18:00.840 --> 18:07.880
memory is often explained on the level of neurons. And so I'm going to butcher it probably, but

18:07.880 --> 18:15.800
one idea that I've heard many times is that one set of neurons is said to encode one idea. And

18:15.800 --> 18:21.480
then if that set is wired to another bundle of neurons, then whenever one thinks of one,

18:22.440 --> 18:25.640
one also thinks of the other. So this is how associative memory is explained.

18:26.440 --> 18:31.000
And also they say that the more you think of those ideas, the stronger the physical connection

18:31.000 --> 18:39.000
that these neurons get. I think that's completely false. I think it's reductionist. And it also

18:39.000 --> 18:46.600
sounds a bit like there might just be a tinge of Lamarck's use and disuse theory sprinkled in there.

18:47.320 --> 18:54.360
But I think the reason that can't be true is that we know from computational universality,

18:54.360 --> 18:58.280
here I'm influenced by David Deutsch again, that we know from computational universality

18:58.280 --> 19:04.200
that we could simulate a mind on a computer, including that mind's memory, even if that

19:04.200 --> 19:11.720
computer hardware doesn't have any neurons. So you don't need neurons. We need to explain

19:12.360 --> 19:18.040
memory on the appropriate level of emergence. And that is software, not hardware.

19:21.480 --> 19:26.200
And I think with this approach, the new Darwinian approach with the replicator approach,

19:27.800 --> 19:34.280
we can answer the question of how memory works. In the biosphere, some species survive

19:34.280 --> 19:38.440
for much longer than others, although it's really the genes that we're concerned with,

19:38.440 --> 19:45.320
not with the animals themselves. And I think the same is true in a mind. Some self-replicating

19:45.320 --> 19:52.680
ideas just manage to stick around longer in that mind's idea pool. And those replicators that are

19:52.680 --> 19:58.440
longer lived than others and happen to encode events from the past, those are the ones that we call

19:58.440 --> 20:03.640
memories. But there's nothing else that's special or different about them that separates them from

20:03.640 --> 20:09.960
other ideas. I think memories are usually thought of as a special class of idea. I certainly used

20:09.960 --> 20:15.960
to think of them that way, but I think that's wrong. And then when a certain population of ideas

20:15.960 --> 20:23.480
and coding memory dies out, let's say because they can't compete with rival ideas in that idea

20:23.480 --> 20:31.000
pool, then that's just what it means to forget something. And we can also explain why memories

20:31.000 --> 20:35.640
are so unreliable. It's because replication isn't perfect and mutations happen eventually.

20:36.360 --> 20:43.800
So memory is just an emergent phenomenon of that underlying pool of self-replicating ideas.

20:43.800 --> 20:49.080
And memory being unreliable is just a special case of knowledge being unreliable.

20:52.840 --> 20:57.640
And now just some small pointers for when it comes to consciousness. Why are we conscious

20:57.640 --> 21:05.240
of some things and not others? Popper conjectured that consciousness has to do with disappointed

21:05.240 --> 21:10.120
expectations. I think this was in his book, Objective Knowledge. If I recall correctly,

21:10.120 --> 21:17.240
he gave this example of walking up a flight of stairs. And if you get to the top and you think

21:17.240 --> 21:22.760
that there's one more step, but there isn't, we've all been there, it feels very weird. And you,

21:23.720 --> 21:30.440
not only are you surprised at that sensation, but you also realize that you had an expectation

21:30.440 --> 21:36.040
that there was another step. And you wouldn't have realized that if there had been another step.

21:37.080 --> 21:42.200
So this is what why Popper argues that consciousness may have to do with disappointed

21:42.200 --> 21:52.120
expectations. Something I'd like to add to that is that when we, for example,

21:52.680 --> 21:58.920
when we're children and we learn how to ride a bike, initially this process is a very

21:58.920 --> 22:05.320
conscious, effortful process. We're very aware of everything we're doing. We're aware of the

22:05.320 --> 22:10.360
peddling. We're aware of keeping our balance. We're aware of steering and everything because

22:10.360 --> 22:16.920
all of this requires error correcting. But as you get better at riding your bicycle,

22:17.080 --> 22:23.800
as you get better at riding your bicycle, you become less aware of those things.

22:24.840 --> 22:30.040
Until now, when I ride my bike, I don't really know how I do it anymore. I just do it,

22:30.040 --> 22:35.480
but I couldn't tell you how I keep my balance, for example. And that allows me to free up my

22:35.480 --> 22:41.000
attention and focus it on the road, for example, so that I can avoid potholes or avoid accidents.

22:41.800 --> 22:47.800
So it seems to me that consciousness has to do with error correction, generally.

22:48.760 --> 22:56.280
And I'd also like to add this observation that I think what's curious is that despite the mutations

22:56.280 --> 23:02.360
of ideas that we know must be happening in our minds because mutations are inevitable,

23:02.360 --> 23:09.480
we never seem to be aware of any junk ideas. But if mutations are usually detrimental,

23:09.880 --> 23:14.280
and only rarely beneficial, that must mean that at any given moment, there are probably

23:14.280 --> 23:20.920
many of these junk ideas in our minds, but we're never aware of them. I think that's curious.

23:20.920 --> 23:28.600
So I conjecture that maybe a necessary condition for something to enter our consciousness

23:29.480 --> 23:35.960
is that it be sufficiently adapted by some yet to be defined criterion. Now, to be clear,

23:36.920 --> 23:42.440
none of this explains consciousness by any means, and it's not meant to. But these are just some

23:42.440 --> 23:51.880
pointers. Something else that I think this approach allows us to do is we can start thinking, taking

23:54.760 --> 23:59.400
maybe what Richard Dawkins would have called the genes I view, and we can take the

24:00.360 --> 24:07.240
ideas view, ideas I view, I guess it would be called, and think about what it would be like for

24:07.240 --> 24:12.600
an idea to live in that self-replicating pool of ideas. And we can think about different

24:12.600 --> 24:18.680
replication strategies that these ideas may have and what effect this could have on the mind.

24:20.840 --> 24:26.520
So now I do want to take it back to the level of memes for a moment. Dave, do I just conjecture

24:26.520 --> 24:31.160
that there are two different replication strategies for memes, static and dynamic.

24:32.520 --> 24:40.680
And I quote from the beginning of Affinity, a dynamic meme is an idea that relies on the

24:40.680 --> 24:47.400
recipient's critical faculties to cause itself to be replicated. So these are ideas that,

24:47.400 --> 24:53.480
broadly speaking, help progress and they help their holder make progress. They can at least.

24:54.440 --> 25:00.760
And opposed to that are static memes or anti-rational memes. And those are quote,

25:01.320 --> 25:05.560
an anti-rational meme is quote, an idea that relies on disabling the recipient's critical

25:05.560 --> 25:13.640
faculties to cause itself to be replicated. So these are ideas that prevent criticism of themselves

25:14.440 --> 25:18.040
and thereby prevent their holder from making much progress. And so

25:18.600 --> 25:25.080
the David Deutsch calls the societies that are dominated by either kind of those memes,

25:25.080 --> 25:30.440
static versus dynamic societies. And so static societies, he says, are the kinds of societies

25:30.440 --> 25:35.640
which rarely ever change on timescales that the people living in those societies could notice.

25:37.160 --> 25:41.800
Whereas the dynamic societies change rapidly and they can make rapid progress because they're

25:41.880 --> 25:47.800
dominated by dynamic means. So those are the memes. But what I wonder is if we could

25:48.680 --> 25:54.600
introduce the same replication strategies inside of minds. So instead of the level of society,

25:55.320 --> 26:00.280
we're now looking at the level of the mind with ideas being the individual actors, not people.

26:02.360 --> 26:07.000
Or ideas, or I should say the self replicating ideas in a mind being the actors, not memes being

26:07.000 --> 26:15.160
the actors. And so that could then lead us to identify, say, certain minds as static

26:15.160 --> 26:21.720
and certain minds as dynamic or more or less of one of the other. And then we could think about

26:21.720 --> 26:26.600
how static minds differ from dynamic minds and maybe what that would mean for mental ailments

26:26.600 --> 26:34.600
and their alleviation. Given the damage that static memes can do to static societies,

26:35.560 --> 26:41.400
or societies, I would not be surprised if static ideas inside a mind can also do great damage to

26:41.400 --> 26:46.520
that mind. And I would expect a static mind to have a much harder time making progress than a

26:46.520 --> 26:56.440
dynamic mind. And perhaps, just like a static society, a mind that's dominated by static ideas

26:56.440 --> 27:02.840
would be overly concerned with faithfully enacting some lifestyle and focusing too much on prevention

27:02.840 --> 27:07.880
strategies, which isn't sustainable. I'm borrowing here from Dave Deutsche again, which isn't

27:07.880 --> 27:11.800
sustainable because the mind would eventually encounter a problem that overwhelms completely.

27:14.600 --> 27:19.640
So that's just an idea to play with. Maybe we can find something interesting there

27:19.640 --> 27:25.800
when it comes to replication strategies inside minds. And then one last thing that I'd like to

27:25.800 --> 27:36.360
mention when it comes to the approach itself is another reason or another explanation for why

27:37.080 --> 27:43.640
you cannot download an idea from one mind to another, which is a direct conclusion from Popper's

27:44.920 --> 27:48.360
critique of what he called instruction from without. It's not like we need another explanation,

27:48.360 --> 27:53.720
but I think this maybe illustrates a little more. So as a thought experiment,

27:54.280 --> 28:00.440
let's say that we have the technology to read people's minds or read their ideas somehow.

28:00.440 --> 28:03.720
It doesn't matter how it works, but let's say you somehow connect their brain to a computer

28:03.720 --> 28:09.000
interface, and then the program in that interface parses all the ideas in that brain and presents

28:09.000 --> 28:15.160
their source code to you. So you could read them technically. And let's just say that's a given.

28:15.160 --> 28:20.200
And let's say that you could then, via the same interface, you could connect to another person's

28:20.840 --> 28:27.000
brain, and you could just copy-paste the idea from one brain to another. So technically,

28:28.680 --> 28:34.360
couldn't we say that that would constitute a successful download of an idea from one mind to

28:34.360 --> 28:42.760
another? And maybe we could, but even if so, I think it still wouldn't refute what Popper meant

28:43.480 --> 28:48.200
when he said that instruction from without is impossible. And I think the reason is that

28:48.440 --> 28:53.240
the transferred idea, once you copy and paste that idea, it most likely will not make it in the new

28:53.240 --> 28:58.920
mind. It's a bit like taking a penguin from an arctic on a place you get in the African jungle.

28:59.880 --> 29:05.880
That penguin is not going to survive, because I think our minds are all extremely different,

29:05.880 --> 29:11.240
just like extremely different ecosystems. So placing an idea from one mind is not going to

29:11.240 --> 29:17.320
make it. We shouldn't expect it to survive in the other mind. The idea, if we want to

29:17.320 --> 29:24.920
get the second mind to have that idea, a much better approach, I think, is to get that mind to

29:24.920 --> 29:34.680
evolve the idea itself, in other words, through persuasion. So this is the new Devonine approach,

29:34.680 --> 29:42.520
more or less, in a nutshell. What I'd like to do is respond to some criticism that the approach

29:42.840 --> 29:53.080
has received. And I'll start with Ella Hepner, who most notably has offered several different

29:53.080 --> 30:02.600
criticisms of the theory. One such criticism says that replication is wasteful. It's computationally

30:02.600 --> 30:11.480
wasteful. And so there wouldn't have been enough memory in our early ancestors' brains for ideas

30:11.480 --> 30:17.240
to replicate. And now I mean memory in the sense of storage space, not in the sense of remembering

30:17.240 --> 30:25.720
things. So my response to that is I'm not sure that that is true. Many complex animals already seem

30:25.720 --> 30:33.000
to have enough spare memory to store additional information during their lifetimes. And in particular,

30:33.000 --> 30:39.960
our ancestors must have had enough memory, at least memory that was free at the time of birth,

30:40.840 --> 30:46.360
for them to copy and store relatively complex memes, at least complex compared to other animals'

30:46.360 --> 30:51.960
memes. Now to be clear, they didn't replicate those memes creatively because this is pre

30:52.920 --> 30:58.200
the evolution of minds. But as David Deutsch points out in the beginning of infinity,

30:58.200 --> 31:03.800
meme evolution already drove the evolution of our ancestors. So there was already selection pressure

31:04.520 --> 31:10.040
favoring the development of ever more free memory in our ancestors' brains so that they

31:10.040 --> 31:14.200
could copy ever more complex memes. And that would have been space that our ancestors'

31:14.920 --> 31:22.520
self-replicating ideas could have used. On the note of memory, I would think that

31:23.480 --> 31:30.920
biological evolution, even long before the evolution of people, would have discovered

31:30.920 --> 31:36.040
basic memory management solutions, such as garbage collection, for example. Garbage collection,

31:37.400 --> 31:41.080
I don't have a computer science degree or anything, but my basic understanding is that garbage

31:41.080 --> 31:49.400
collection is a way to monitor a program's memory usage and monitor its memory pressure.

31:50.200 --> 31:54.920
And if you only have so much memory available on your computer and your program is using,

31:54.920 --> 32:00.840
say, 95% of it, then the garbage collector will go in and look for any stale references

32:00.840 --> 32:04.680
to data that you're not using anymore, that the program isn't using anymore, and then it just

32:04.680 --> 32:09.960
deletes those references. Though I may be butchering now, but I think that's the gist of it.

32:11.480 --> 32:17.400
And I would expect that evolution would have stumbled upon something like that much earlier,

32:17.400 --> 32:24.760
because it seems to me that any organism that can store additional information during its lifetime

32:24.760 --> 32:28.840
would eventually run into memory pressure issues. And so evolution must have evolved,

32:28.840 --> 32:34.360
there must have been a solution to this problem. Also, these increases in memory that I think are

32:34.360 --> 32:41.400
needed for those self-replicating ideas, they would have happened very gradually. So I'm not

32:41.400 --> 32:46.440
suggesting that once self-replicating ideas came on the scene within minds that suddenly brains

32:46.440 --> 32:51.480
had plenty of extra storage, certainly possible that initially there wasn't all that much extra

32:52.200 --> 33:00.120
memory to go around, but maybe just enough to help that adaptation spread. And then there was

33:00.120 --> 33:04.280
selection pressure, biological selection pressure to increase memory in humans brains if that

33:04.280 --> 33:10.120
adaptation was helpful enough. By some accounts, there was a large and relatively sudden increase

33:11.240 --> 33:15.720
in memory in our evolutionary history, and I've heard theories that attribute that to a change

33:15.720 --> 33:21.320
in diet or upright posture or opposable thumbs and all that stuff, but it could also be possible

33:21.320 --> 33:26.280
that that increase in memory in our brains was caused by the selection pressure I've just described.

33:29.400 --> 33:39.080
And lastly, for this particular point, the claim that replication is wasteful or redundant

33:41.400 --> 33:47.000
in the sense of being unnecessary, it reminds me a bit of, although this criticism is not meant

33:47.720 --> 33:52.440
as a creationist standpoint, but it reminds me a bit of what a creationist might say about

33:52.440 --> 33:59.000
replication and biological evolution. A creationist might think that genes carrying

33:59.800 --> 34:04.520
the same knowledge millions of times over in each organism is unnecessary. To them, it might seem

34:05.320 --> 34:12.200
much more parsimonious and efficient to simply say that a single entity, God, for example,

34:12.200 --> 34:16.040
contains a single copy of all the knowledge that's required to create each organism,

34:16.040 --> 34:18.280
and then each organism is just the result of him doing that.

34:22.360 --> 34:27.640
Okay, then another criticism that Ella has offered is the self-replicating ideas. They sound

34:27.640 --> 34:31.880
dangerous. They could have led to all sorts of dangerous behavior in our ancestors,

34:32.840 --> 34:39.640
and so biological evolution would have selected against them. I don't think this is true either.

34:40.600 --> 34:49.400
I think animals around us are evidence that they contain sophisticated knowledge with

34:49.400 --> 34:55.640
enough reach to guard against unwanted behavior, for example,

34:55.640 --> 35:01.480
being stuck in an endless loop or something. I've tried this. Even a well-behaved dog won't repeat

35:01.480 --> 35:08.200
a trick forever when instructed to. It'll only do it so many times. It just stops at some point.

35:08.920 --> 35:17.640
There seem to be built-in criteria that can override erroneous behavior. It seems to me that

35:17.640 --> 35:25.800
biological evolution has already has built-in safeguards. Self-replicating ideas wouldn't

35:25.800 --> 35:29.480
automatically have led to ever repeating behaviors or something that would

35:30.520 --> 35:36.120
certainly cause death for the organism. I think actually the opposite is the case.

35:37.080 --> 35:44.520
Self-replicating ideas were then and are beneficial, and they helped the genes spread

35:44.520 --> 35:53.640
that code for them. Because whenever there was a detrimental genetic mutation present in an organism

35:54.600 --> 36:02.600
that led to a bad mutation in one of those organisms' ideas, it was thanks to those

36:02.680 --> 36:07.080
self-replicating ideas that there was an opportunity that broke in functionality

36:07.080 --> 36:14.920
with working functionality. Because detrimental mutations are much more numerous than beneficial

36:14.920 --> 36:20.440
ones, that actually means that the existence of self-replicating ideas was favored by biological

36:20.440 --> 36:25.720
evolution up to a rate at which detrimental mutations occur. I think there would have been

36:25.720 --> 36:30.520
strong selective pressure in favor of self-replicating ideas in mind because it would have helped the

36:30.520 --> 36:39.880
genes spread. And then Ella has offered another approach that one could implement the same

36:40.440 --> 36:46.840
algorithms, the same self-replicating idea pool without replication. And the idea is basically

36:46.840 --> 36:51.960
you just have a single instance of each idea and a score or weight that you attribute to each,

36:51.960 --> 36:59.560
and then increasing and decreasing the weight as you go. And David George recently independently

36:59.560 --> 37:07.080
suggested this criticism as well. Now, it seems to me that denotationally that sounds

37:07.080 --> 37:13.640
similar to my theory, and I think Ella in particular has in mind, although she's here,

37:13.640 --> 37:19.640
she should correct me on this, but I think Ella in particular has in mind what's his name,

37:19.640 --> 37:25.400
Donald Campbell's work on evolution, that you don't really need replication so the argument

37:25.400 --> 37:30.040
goes, you just need variation and selection. Imperfect replication can be the source of

37:31.480 --> 37:40.040
variation, but it need not be. Now, I've said in the past, and I'm still of the opinion that I'm

37:40.040 --> 37:46.360
agnostic as to the question of necessity, but if we were to make this change, I think it would come

37:46.360 --> 37:52.760
at some costs. The one thing that I think the New Darwinian approach, the approach that does adopt

37:52.760 --> 37:58.440
replication brings to the table is that we can explain how people evolved. I'm not sure how we

37:58.440 --> 38:04.440
would do that, because it allows us to explain with a very simple accidental small mutation.

38:05.240 --> 38:11.560
I'm not sure this algorithm that would store and decrease weights, we would have to explain

38:11.560 --> 38:16.520
how that one came about. That seems to require a different explanation that I'm not aware,

38:16.520 --> 38:22.600
I'm not familiar with. And then the question is, when does it decide to mutate an idea and

38:22.680 --> 38:26.680
why and how, and at which location in the idea source code?

38:30.280 --> 38:36.280
It also seems to me that such an algorithm would make plant mutations, but in real evolution,

38:36.280 --> 38:47.560
mutations are not planned. So, what I like about the, what I like about my approach is that

38:48.360 --> 38:52.120
none of these questions need to be answered in explicit programming. These are all just

38:52.760 --> 38:56.680
things that automatically fall out of having self-replicating ideas.

38:58.600 --> 39:02.760
So, in a way, actually structurally speaking, maybe it's the pool of self-replicating ideas

39:02.760 --> 39:07.240
that's more parsimonious, because you don't need to explicitly program any of these other things.

39:07.480 --> 39:21.480
And if the goal of that approach is to, if the goal of that approach is to get rid of replication,

39:21.480 --> 39:27.800
because it might be wasteful or redundant or whatever, then the thing is, let's say you'd

39:27.800 --> 39:32.520
have one instance of an idea and you'd have a weight associated to it, and let's say at some

39:32.520 --> 39:38.120
point this master algorithm decides to make a copy of it and mutate it, and so at that point

39:38.120 --> 39:43.320
you would store a second entry, and over time you would get more and more entries in some registry

39:43.320 --> 39:53.720
of ideas or whatever. And I think then you would still get source code that is shared among many

39:53.720 --> 40:00.680
of these entries, and so it's a little bit similar to what Dawkins has pointed out with in regard to

40:01.480 --> 40:07.560
the cisterns and the DNA versus the genes, which he defines separately. The cisterns,

40:07.560 --> 40:11.640
or maybe butchering the term, but I think that's what is called the cisterns, are like the actual

40:11.640 --> 40:18.440
section in the genome that code for eye color say, whereas the gene he defines as the longest

40:18.440 --> 40:22.360
possible stretch of the genome that gets replicated over and over without changes.

40:22.920 --> 40:28.120
You'd get a very similar phenomenon in this registry of ideas where you'd have sections

40:28.120 --> 40:33.800
of those ideas that stay the same across those entries, and then that would be the replicator.

40:34.920 --> 40:39.240
So although the idea is set out to get rid of replication, I'm not sure it actually does.

40:41.800 --> 40:47.800
And I think what's nice about adopting replication is that it gives us consistency

40:47.800 --> 40:52.600
with other evolutionary phenomena that we know exist and we know are powered by replication,

40:52.600 --> 40:57.400
that's biological evolution and meme evolution, and I think that consistency is valuable

40:58.360 --> 41:01.560
because it means that we can share knowledge between these different disciplines.

41:04.120 --> 41:08.280
So I like to think that this new Darwinian approach has a unifying character and I think

41:08.280 --> 41:16.680
that's worth keeping. And we couldn't, excuse me, we couldn't investigate the static and dynamic

41:16.680 --> 41:23.080
replication strategies in the mind anymore without replication. Those really are replication

41:23.080 --> 41:31.080
strategies and they don't work without replication. And then the last criticism that I'm familiar with

41:31.080 --> 41:39.400
that Ella has offered is that it's unclear how the mind creates and discovers problems

41:39.400 --> 41:44.600
and contradictions and that that's the driving force of creativity. So that's a really important

41:44.600 --> 41:52.520
thing to answer. And I agree with that. So I want to clarify. My current idea is that

41:53.320 --> 41:59.560
when there are populations of ideas that are competing in a mind, especially when they compete

41:59.560 --> 42:06.920
fiercely over resources, memory, for example, then that leads to cognitive dissonance that

42:06.920 --> 42:11.960
the cognitive dissonance that we experience when we experience a problem. And depending on the nature

42:11.960 --> 42:18.680
or the fierceness of the competition that we may, a problem may seem interesting or annoying or

42:18.680 --> 42:24.600
downright depressing, like I said, depending on the nature of the competition. And then when we solve

42:24.600 --> 42:30.440
such a conflict, it could mean, for example, that there's a third population of ideas that

42:30.440 --> 42:36.680
has evolved and operates as a sort of mediator, enabling the two conflicting populations to

42:36.680 --> 42:43.800
coexist peacefully, or it could fight and win against both populations and largely replace them.

42:43.800 --> 42:49.560
I think that's what might be happening when you have one theory that supersedes and explains

42:49.560 --> 42:53.240
two conflicting ones, which then live on in the new theory as approximations.

42:55.560 --> 42:58.840
Or it could just enable one of the two to win over the other.

43:00.920 --> 43:07.000
And then recently, David Deutsch suggested that we need not mimic how biological evolution

43:07.000 --> 43:12.120
created creativity, the same way that planes don't need to mimic birds to fly.

43:12.920 --> 43:17.480
And I agree with that. I just, I don't know of any other way yet.

43:21.560 --> 43:28.200
And, yeah, and I forget if I mentioned it, but he also just like, just like Ella Hepner

43:28.200 --> 43:34.280
suggested that replication would be inefficient, that it wouldn't be necessarily the approach that

43:34.280 --> 43:42.440
a programmer would take. So all these criticisms would be very helpful and have motivated me to

43:42.440 --> 43:49.240
think more about this idea. But what strikes me is that I think none of these are conclusive

43:49.240 --> 43:55.160
criticisms. And this brings me to something that many of them have in common. I think they're

43:55.160 --> 44:01.240
along the lines of, they say something like self replicating ideas are not necessary to explain

44:01.240 --> 44:07.880
the mind. And like I said, I agree with that. In fact, I'm pretty certain that my, that my

44:07.880 --> 44:20.520
approach is wrong. What I'd like to find out is why. And I think the, a, an avenue that I would

44:20.520 --> 44:29.240
find more, more productive is what, what is an explanation for why self replicating ideas

44:29.240 --> 44:35.240
cannot be part of the mind, not why they need not. And like a real refutation of the idea

44:35.240 --> 44:40.440
would be extremely helpful. That also brings me to what could change my mind about this,

44:40.440 --> 44:44.920
this approach. That is one of them, just just an explanation of why it cannot involve self

44:44.920 --> 44:49.880
replicating ideas. And then also an internal contradiction or something like that that I'm

44:49.880 --> 44:54.040
unable to fix. At least that would, that would definitely constitute a big problem that I would

44:54.040 --> 45:01.160
need to solve. I should point out that the idea that self replication, for example, would have hurt

45:01.960 --> 45:10.200
the genes encoding that it would have hurt genes in biological evolution. I think that was a

45:10.200 --> 45:15.800
candidate for why creativity cannot involve several self replicating ideas. So I think something

45:15.800 --> 45:22.600
like that would be promising. And then lastly, some outstanding problems. There are still big

45:22.600 --> 45:28.600
unknowns left. Like I said, consciousness is the big one. Something that I've been thinking about

45:28.600 --> 45:34.840
recently is that when you, the, the approach kind of goes along the lines of, well, as long as you

45:34.840 --> 45:39.880
have self replicating ideas, you kind of get variation automatically eventually because the

45:39.880 --> 45:46.440
mind is messy. And therefore you also get selection automatically because different variants spread

45:47.400 --> 45:53.000
with different rates at different rates. But if you actually write a self replicating computer

45:53.000 --> 45:58.040
program, they're also called a quine. They don't ever mutate. You can run them a billion times in

45:58.040 --> 46:06.920
a row. They don't mutate unless you force them to, but then mutations are planned. So that tells

46:06.920 --> 46:11.320
me that the self replicating programs that people have written are too good at replication for

46:11.320 --> 46:18.360
evolution to occur. And then there's the problem with evolutionary algorithms generally that David

46:18.360 --> 46:22.920
Dorch has written about in the beginning infinity, which is that as a programmer, you can't really

46:22.920 --> 46:27.960
tell if the knowledge that you find in the program after running it is knowledge that the

46:27.960 --> 46:32.040
program created itself, or if that is knowledge that you as a program just happen to put into it

46:32.040 --> 46:37.640
without realizing it, you leak that knowledge into the program. And so you can't really judge

46:37.640 --> 46:43.800
whether the program is creative. You'd need to know to make that call. So we'd need to find a

46:43.800 --> 46:52.600
solution for that before even trying to implement this theory. And yeah, so that is the approach.

46:53.720 --> 46:59.560
And I'd be ready to take questions if there are any. Great. Thanks so much for the talk.

46:59.880 --> 47:07.080
Um, yeah, so we have about 45 minutes of questions. And I think what we'll do is,

47:07.640 --> 47:14.760
Dennis, if you could first close the presentation, because I think it's nice.

47:18.440 --> 47:19.160
Go back to

47:22.120 --> 47:27.960
And then I will open with a question. And then anyone who wants to answer,

47:28.040 --> 47:35.320
who wants to ask a question can do so afterwards either by raising your hand, as I see David has

47:35.320 --> 47:44.120
done, or by typing in the chat. Yeah, so the first question I had was, I really liked the idea set

47:44.120 --> 47:51.960
out. And I like, especially explanation of memory. And this idea that memories are replicators and

47:52.440 --> 48:00.440
the memories that you retain, other ones that have replicated best. But memory in my computer

48:00.440 --> 48:07.240
is just accessible, like the files in my computer don't replicate. If I require an old file,

48:08.120 --> 48:13.960
I get an exact copy of that file, and I just retrieve it as it was when I first stored it.

48:15.240 --> 48:20.440
Why do you think that minds store memories differently? Why do you think that they will

48:20.440 --> 48:30.120
have to replicate? Yes. I think it's sort of a quirk, maybe of the English language that we

48:30.120 --> 48:35.720
use the term memory to refer to both of these phenomena, even though I think they describe

48:35.720 --> 48:42.120
different things. Memory in the second sense, in the sense that your computer uses,

48:42.840 --> 48:49.240
actually our brains have too, because they need to store data in that sense. And that

48:49.240 --> 48:54.360
is just the plain old memory storage that you've described, and nothing changes. Like if I store

48:55.080 --> 48:59.880
very rarely, because our hard drives are very reliable. So yeah, if you store a file on your

48:59.880 --> 49:05.640
computer, it just stays there and it doesn't replicate. So this is, I think that is like a

49:05.640 --> 49:11.000
lower level kind of memory phenomenon, like the direct interaction with the hardware for how to

49:11.000 --> 49:16.440
store information. The kind of memory in the sense of remembering things,

49:19.480 --> 49:24.440
I think it's just a different phenomenon. And that is the phenomenon that involves

49:25.080 --> 49:29.880
the self-replicating ideas. So I would just distinguish between the two.

49:30.760 --> 49:36.440
Very nice. Okay, thanks for your answer. Then I see that David has a raised hand. David,

49:36.440 --> 49:43.960
go ahead and ask a few questions. Hi. Well, I too found that very persuasive,

49:43.960 --> 49:52.680
and I also liked the way that it kind of explains features of the would otherwise

49:52.680 --> 50:00.760
perhaps seem accidental features of the human mind and memory as well. I just,

50:00.760 --> 50:13.560
I can't quite see the overall picture though. So in RNA world, there were, as it were,

50:15.000 --> 50:26.840
genes, but no organisms. Right. And in the brain, in your picture, I think there's also

50:27.640 --> 50:36.280
genes, but no organisms. Is that right, first of all? Yes, that is right. I've wondered if maybe

50:36.280 --> 50:42.680
sometimes ideas, as they get more complex, as they replicate in the mind, if they stumble upon

50:43.480 --> 50:47.720
a replication strategy, something like the genes stumbled upon when they invented organisms.

50:47.960 --> 50:58.600
Well, yeah. Well, so the thing is that if you imagine a huge soup of RNA, then it doesn't have

50:58.600 --> 51:05.000
an outside world. That is the only outside world it interacts with is other RNA molecules.

51:05.480 --> 51:20.760
Things started happening in RNA world to make more sophisticated replicators when RNA started

51:20.760 --> 51:32.120
manipulating things that aren't RNA and started, for example, making enzymes, making proteins,

51:32.760 --> 51:40.520
and so on. So I would guess that there's only so far you can get by twisting RNA into different

51:40.520 --> 51:48.600
shapes and trying to get them to produce more of those. But at some point, they invented enzymes.

51:48.600 --> 51:58.680
And then, from then on, there's phenotypes. There's organisms. I, I, I don't know, I don't know,

51:58.680 --> 52:09.400
there's organisms. I, I'm not, I'm not asking how you explain the origin of species, you know,

52:09.400 --> 52:18.280
why a bunch of DNA just moves along through the world together. It's not that. It's, it's the,

52:19.080 --> 52:28.840
it's, it's the, when it gets to encounter the non RNA world. And I think most selection in the

52:28.840 --> 52:41.160
biosphere and most selection in the brain, I'm guessing, is caused by problems to do with the

52:41.640 --> 52:48.600
non RNA, to do with the outside world. It's the outside world that causes things in the inner

52:48.600 --> 52:56.840
world to come into conflict. Right. Okay. So, you know, I'm just kind of asking or asking for

52:56.840 --> 53:02.200
comment or whatever. I mean, I don't have any objection to the idea. I think it's a great idea.

53:02.200 --> 53:09.720
And, you know, please pursue it. Great. No, you know, I think that is a really helpful

53:09.800 --> 53:14.120
pointer that is, I don't have an answer off the bat for you for that. I think that's something

53:14.120 --> 53:20.120
I'd very much like to explore. So I'll, I'll keep thinking about it. Okay. Can't ask for more.

53:22.120 --> 53:29.560
Oh, then Timothy, do you have a race time? Yeah. Hi, Dennis. Thanks for the talk. I really enjoyed

53:29.560 --> 53:37.880
it. Hi. I think, I think one term that I'm sort of stumbling over in this framework is accidental.

53:38.600 --> 53:45.640
How do you think about our sort of effectiveness at problem solving or the kind of deliberateness

53:45.640 --> 53:49.880
of it in terms of this accidental idea creation?

53:53.080 --> 53:58.760
Do I understand correctly that you're trying to square the purposeful thinking or the, at

53:58.760 --> 54:03.960
least the purposeful, the feeling that we get that we're purposefully solving a problem, say,

54:04.040 --> 54:08.200
with the notion that ideas mutate accidentally? Am I understanding that right?

54:08.200 --> 54:13.640
Yeah. I mean, not just the feeling, the fact that we actually approach problems and solve them.

54:14.760 --> 54:25.320
Right. Yeah. I do, I've thought about this too, and I think it's a really interesting

54:25.320 --> 54:35.800
thing to explore. The, I think those things can be squared. And I think the way we introspect and

54:35.800 --> 54:42.840
look at the way we solve problems is often deceptive. And this has led to ideas such as induction,

54:42.840 --> 54:48.840
for example, where people even though they could not have induced from experience,

54:48.840 --> 54:56.600
that's what they thought they did. So people can be mistaken about what they, what they're doing

54:56.600 --> 55:06.520
when they solve problems. And the thing that ideas happen to morph into a new conjecture that,

55:06.520 --> 55:13.720
that solves a problem, say, I think isn't really at odds with purposeful problem solving.

55:13.720 --> 55:19.000
We, we purpose, we want to solve problems. That means we have ideas that we would like when

55:19.000 --> 55:25.000
there's a conflict, we would like to solve it. And that idea exists even before we encounter a

55:25.000 --> 55:32.600
solution to a problem. But the, the solution to the problem itself, we can't really move toward

55:32.600 --> 55:37.960
in a targeted fashion because we don't know yet what it might be. It's unknowable in advance. We

55:37.960 --> 55:42.360
only know it once we've evolved it. And at that point, we just kind of happened to know it.

55:43.320 --> 55:48.920
I think that's just true of evolution generally is whether it's the gene or the self-replicating

55:48.920 --> 55:55.560
idea in the mind. There's only, I think Popper called them happy accidents. There's only happy

55:55.560 --> 56:03.800
accidents, or sometimes not so happy ones. That's, I think, all we have. We can't think of a solution

56:03.800 --> 56:11.720
before we, before that idea mutates into one. Does that make sense? I'm not sure that I,

56:11.720 --> 56:13.960
that I really put my finger on your, on your question.

56:18.760 --> 56:24.680
I am not hearing the participants. Sorry, sorry, that, that, that does make sense. I'm not,

56:25.400 --> 56:29.480
yeah, I'm not sure if it, it quite feels the gap for me, but I'm,

56:32.440 --> 56:37.400
yeah, I'm not sure of a better way of framing it, but thanks for the, thanks for your response.

56:37.400 --> 56:45.960
Okay, sure. Okay, then I see you have two more raised hands. I don't know who was first. I think

56:45.960 --> 56:51.720
I'll go with Paarek. I, I think he must be asking your name. So, so go ahead.

56:51.720 --> 56:56.840
That's all, yeah. That's Paarek. Thanks a million. Really enjoyed the talk, Dennis. Thanks a lot for

56:56.840 --> 57:04.120
it. And so yeah, my question was sort of related to the last question a little bit, but you remarked,

57:04.920 --> 57:12.280
I think about halfway through the talk about, there may be, because ideas will self-replicate,

57:12.280 --> 57:19.400
there will be these junk ideas, which are analogous in some ways to, to junk DNA. So,

57:19.400 --> 57:32.200
I guess my question is about the self-replication. So within this model is the replication a matter

57:32.200 --> 57:40.280
of degree, so that the, the idea, which isn't the junk idea, which presumably is the one that

57:40.280 --> 57:47.800
we're, we're then conscious of, you know, because you're, you were mentioning that we, we, there's

57:47.800 --> 57:54.920
a lot that we're, we're unconscious of, and those would be the, the sort of the ridiculous answers,

57:54.920 --> 58:00.440
let's say, to a problem or the ones that we don't get promoted into our awareness.

58:01.160 --> 58:09.400
But the ones we are aware of, would those be more active replicators in, in, in this way, or, or

58:09.400 --> 58:17.640
they're, so yeah, I guess it's sort of a two-part question. One is like, is the replication a

58:17.640 --> 58:25.320
matter of degree? And secondly, are the, the ones we become conscious of, the sort of better at

58:26.280 --> 58:32.520
causing their, their copying? Yeah, I'll, I'll, I'll try to answer the second one first.

58:33.880 --> 58:42.440
They, I think being better at copying oneself is one way to just retain the, the faithfulness and

58:42.440 --> 58:50.520
the, the coherence of an idea, for sure. So that if, if that idea wants and scare quotes to be,

58:51.160 --> 58:56.600
to be thought of again, one, a good way to do that is to make sure that one retains one's

58:56.600 --> 59:06.280
faithfulness. I could see that. Now, with regard to whether that makes it a more active replicator,

59:06.280 --> 59:13.560
I don't know, I could certainly imagine that there are ideas with different replication rates.

59:14.200 --> 59:23.320
One might replicate twice as often as the other. And if it can make up for, for, you know, the

59:23.320 --> 59:28.760
mutations that might be introduced during that, the, the double replication, then it's fine.

59:31.080 --> 59:37.720
So I guess it just depends on how reliable the replicator it is, or it is not very reliable,

59:37.720 --> 59:46.200
but thanks to those mutations, it creates a new idea. And then that new idea is coherent enough

59:46.200 --> 59:51.560
that you become aware of it. So that could also be the case. So I'm not sure that we could tie it to

59:52.280 --> 59:57.880
the activity of a replicator per se. With regard to your, your first question, I'm not sure what

59:57.880 --> 01:00:04.760
you mean by degree of replication. Yeah, I guess just to clarify it a little bit. So, you know, some

01:00:08.120 --> 01:00:12.840
questions. So to, to bring it back to the analogy that within genes, there will be,

01:00:14.280 --> 01:00:20.920
like the junk DNA is a replicator of sorts, although it's, it's not usually referred to

01:00:20.920 --> 01:00:27.320
as a replicator because it's, it's not, you know, it would contribute within its environment,

01:00:27.320 --> 01:00:33.880
it contributes to its copying more than, you know, a whole lot of other physical objects.

01:00:34.360 --> 01:00:40.840
And both it's, you know, it's, it's, for some, it's maybe not worth calling a replicator because

01:00:40.840 --> 01:00:47.720
it does so far less well than, than the ones we call replicators. So I was just wondering if that's

01:00:47.720 --> 01:00:54.360
the same sort of implication that was being drawn between the analogy of junk ideas and junk DNA,

01:00:54.360 --> 01:00:59.960
that they are sort of, they're still self replicating, but they're, they're less,

01:01:00.520 --> 01:01:08.440
less good. I got you. Yeah. No, I think, I think absolutely that could happen. Yeah, you get,

01:01:08.440 --> 01:01:13.240
you could through an, through mutation, you could get a junk idea that's, it's junk in the sense

01:01:13.240 --> 01:01:17.640
of that doesn't result in a coherent idea anymore, but it's still kind of manages to get itself

01:01:17.640 --> 01:01:23.080
replicated every now and then that could happen. Or sometimes the mutation might be so detrimental

01:01:23.080 --> 01:01:32.360
that it's just, it dies immediately. Yeah. Then I see Danny has a raised hands. Danny, go ahead.

01:01:34.040 --> 01:01:39.880
Hi Dennis. I really enjoyed the talk as well. And one of the things that I really like about this

01:01:39.880 --> 01:01:44.840
theory, which is something that I've wondered about myself in the past, is the fact that

01:01:45.480 --> 01:01:50.120
Popper's notion where we conjecture ideas, I've always wondered why the ideas that appear in

01:01:50.120 --> 01:01:56.120
our conscious mind seem to be non random. You know, so the, you know, to take your example about

01:01:56.120 --> 01:02:00.760
the keys, you know, some silly idea about your keys being somewhere that you've never been before,

01:02:00.760 --> 01:02:06.200
that idea doesn't appear in your mind. So I suppose my question would be, do you have any conjectures

01:02:06.200 --> 01:02:14.040
around what is happening in the mind in that moment when an idea, when that first idea appears in your

01:02:14.040 --> 01:02:21.800
conscious mind? So what is happening when your mind quote unquote, like selects one idea to

01:02:21.800 --> 01:02:25.960
present to you consciously? Have you, have you thought about that at all?

01:02:27.560 --> 01:02:34.840
Yeah, I have. And one idea that I've just played with is that maybe what's happening is that

01:02:37.160 --> 01:02:41.160
in the pocket of the population of ideas that's relevant to this problem,

01:02:42.040 --> 01:02:45.960
um, maybe the idea that you've left your keys on a kitchen counter

01:02:47.480 --> 01:02:53.480
is just very good at spreading through this pocket and it outnumbers rivals. And

01:02:54.600 --> 01:03:00.600
that's why it gains a foothold in that niche. And maybe that is why you become aware of it. This

01:03:00.600 --> 01:03:06.120
is just a, you know, purely conjectural, I'm making stuff up kind of thing. But

01:03:06.520 --> 01:03:13.480
um, that's an idea I've played with. So, so more broadly than it's, you think it might be possible that

01:03:14.040 --> 01:03:20.920
um, the distinction between, you know, the ideas in the conscious mind and the ideas in the unconscious

01:03:20.920 --> 01:03:28.760
mind has something to do with, we'll say the number of, of replicas of an idea or, or am I maybe

01:03:28.760 --> 01:03:34.040
stretching, stretching what you just said as Marlon? Well, I think it may have to do with that.

01:03:34.040 --> 01:03:43.160
And um, it, it may have to do with one idea outnumbering or overwhelming,

01:03:44.760 --> 01:03:49.080
or one population of that idea, like one set of replicas of that idea, outnumbering another

01:03:49.080 --> 01:03:54.360
competing set. And that's why you don't think of the other set. I think that is one, one thing.

01:03:54.360 --> 01:04:00.840
And then as I've mentioned, there's the thing about ideas competing fiercely and that constituting a

01:04:00.840 --> 01:04:06.600
problem. That is also something that become aware. I would imagine that their ideas competing all the

01:04:06.600 --> 01:04:12.040
time, countless ideas competing all the time in our minds, but the competition is so small and,

01:04:12.040 --> 01:04:18.040
you know, the conflict is so small that you don't, you don't realize it. But because the, the key,

01:04:18.680 --> 01:04:23.960
and the key example of the missing key, it must mean that just by virtue of you thinking and

01:04:23.960 --> 01:04:30.760
recognizing it as a problem, it could mean that there were two populations of ideas

01:04:31.560 --> 01:04:39.640
encoding, um, conflicting preferences. Say one, I want to leave, um, that is my preference,

01:04:39.640 --> 01:04:44.520
conflicting with the idea that I can't find my key, so I can't leave. And this, this conflict is

01:04:44.520 --> 01:04:49.160
both on both sides, the ideas are numerous enough that the conflict conflict is noticeable

01:04:49.800 --> 01:04:54.680
that you, I mean, it's a bit circular because I'm trying to explain what we notice in terms of what

01:04:54.680 --> 01:05:00.600
is noticeable. Um, but I'm suggesting that that is what makes it noticeable. Uh,

01:05:02.120 --> 01:05:05.400
if that makes, I hope that makes sense. Yeah, yeah, I know it does. Thank you. Thank you.

01:05:07.240 --> 01:05:15.560
Okay, I don't see other raised hands, so I will ask another question. And it has to do with

01:05:16.520 --> 01:05:26.200
uh, these higher level concepts. So we, we, we also, like, you, you draw this picture of, of

01:05:26.200 --> 01:05:35.080
single ideas, uh, evolving in a mind and, and partly you say that, for example, we

01:05:36.040 --> 01:05:41.320
experienced suffering as a, as a consequence of competition between ideas. Uh, and I think what

01:05:41.320 --> 01:05:47.160
I'm wondering is, like, where does the sense of self come in and where does, uh, this is kind of

01:05:47.160 --> 01:05:55.640
related to the question of where does conscious problem solving come in? And, uh, just truly,

01:05:55.640 --> 01:06:01.560
I mean, I can imagine there would be such an explanation of consciousness or, of, uh, maybe

01:06:01.560 --> 01:06:07.320
that's asking too much, but where, where do these seemingly higher level, uh, entities come in? The

01:06:07.320 --> 01:06:13.160
sense of self, uh, sense of direction, sense of purpose. Um, and yeah, this is kind of a vague

01:06:13.160 --> 01:06:18.840
question that is pointing at something. I hope it's enough. No, no, it's a great question. Um, yeah,

01:06:18.840 --> 01:06:24.520
I'm afraid it really is the big one. I don't have any, any good answers for you. I mean, I, I have

01:06:24.520 --> 01:06:30.200
thought that there, that there is a sort of meta algorithm in the mind that, that we've inherited

01:06:30.200 --> 01:06:36.280
from, from our ancestors that used to just be, um, responsible for interrupting, you know, bad

01:06:36.280 --> 01:06:42.920
loops or stuff like that. But, um, and maybe that is, because it looks over the pool of replicating

01:06:42.920 --> 01:06:47.240
ideas, that maybe that is why we have this, we, at least that's how we feel, that we have this

01:06:47.240 --> 01:06:52.920
bird's eye view of our ideas. But I don't know. Uh, I would really like to know.

01:06:54.120 --> 01:06:58.280
Yeah, same. But it's, yeah, as I said, it's, it's maybe too big of a question.

01:07:00.040 --> 01:07:04.280
I see there's more race hands now. Uh, and I think Antonio was first. So,

01:07:04.280 --> 01:07:11.080
Antonio, if you want to ask a question, go ahead. That's right. Thank you. Um, so I don't want to get

01:07:11.080 --> 01:07:19.960
into a play of definitions, but what do you mean when you say an idea? And do you differentiate

01:07:19.960 --> 01:07:26.200
it between the explicit content or the inexplicit content? Do you think it matters at all how they

01:07:26.200 --> 01:07:33.160
are instantiated in the brain? What would be like the goal of an idea? Why wouldn't want to exist

01:07:33.160 --> 01:07:39.720
in your brain in the first place? Because, yeah, unless you actually define what you mean by idea,

01:07:40.280 --> 01:07:45.720
having self-replicating ideas doesn't say much about what's going on.

01:07:47.480 --> 01:07:52.680
So the, the, what's throughout to me is when you said that, why would an idea want to be

01:07:53.320 --> 01:07:59.400
in a, in a mind? I don't think it does. Um, this, the same way that there's no gene that wants to

01:07:59.400 --> 01:08:03.160
be in the biosphere just kind of finds itself there. And because it's a replicator, it makes

01:08:03.160 --> 01:08:09.960
ever more of itself. Um, there, there, there's nothing, um, you know, the, the, on the level

01:08:09.960 --> 01:08:14.280
of the replicator, there's, there is no consciousness or purposeful purposefulness. So,

01:08:15.160 --> 01:08:21.560
um, now when it comes to what, like, how, what do these ideas actually look like? How are they

01:08:21.560 --> 01:08:26.040
implemented? Um, I have given this some thought now at the risk of it getting too technical.

01:08:26.040 --> 01:08:30.600
I think of ideas the way they're stored in the brain when it comes to source code as

01:08:31.400 --> 01:08:37.000
functions in the sense of the lambda calculus. And I do think there are important parallels

01:08:37.000 --> 01:08:41.240
between, or not just parallels, I actually think they're the same between functions in the sense

01:08:41.240 --> 01:08:47.320
of the lambda calculus and explanations. And so I use the term idea just for those functions.

01:08:48.600 --> 01:08:54.360
Um, before just those functions, I should say. Um, so that would be my technical answer to

01:08:54.920 --> 01:09:03.160
how our ideas implemented in the mind. Um, if that helps. Okay. If you imagine a brain,

01:09:04.040 --> 01:09:10.360
a human brain, okay, human baby raised without language. Okay.

01:09:12.200 --> 01:09:18.440
In 2021, now you can raise a human being without, say, speaking to it, to humor her, whatever.

01:09:19.320 --> 01:09:27.560
Um, do you think that it will contain knowledge? Will it only contain like inexplicit knowledge,

01:09:27.560 --> 01:09:33.560
but it will be able to move around, to hand, to eat, to feed, to interact with other human beings

01:09:34.680 --> 01:09:36.520
purely on an inexplicit level?

01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:45.160
Yeah. Um, I think so. I think, I mean, our ancestors at some point were in that stage,

01:09:45.160 --> 01:09:50.760
right? Before the invention of language, presumably they had the same brain, the same genes.

01:09:52.360 --> 01:09:59.240
Yeah. Um, no, I do think that language comes after. Um, you have creativity and that's what

01:09:59.240 --> 01:10:04.280
allows you to learn language. It's not the other way around. Um, so yeah, I think there's plenty

01:10:04.280 --> 01:10:09.880
of things that people can learn even without language and the inexplicit ideas will do.

01:10:10.440 --> 01:10:17.240
And what is the mechanism of how they learn all these inexplicit ideas be different

01:10:17.240 --> 01:10:19.160
to how they learn explicit ideas?

01:10:20.440 --> 01:10:26.200
Um, I don't think so. I think the, the method and scare quotes of conjecture and criticism is universal.

01:10:28.440 --> 01:10:34.120
I mean, yeah, I think it worked the same for, for explicit ideas as for inexplicit ideas.

01:10:34.680 --> 01:10:40.600
And wouldn't it be more easy if the mechanism is the same to try to explain

01:10:42.040 --> 01:10:49.240
how we learn inexplicit ideas before jumping to the explicit ones and having all these extra

01:10:49.240 --> 01:10:55.000
dimensions of language of science, all these meta levels?

01:10:56.760 --> 01:10:58.200
Um, I would agree. Yeah.

01:10:58.760 --> 01:11:02.040
Yeah. Okay. I'll pause here and maybe we can

01:11:03.400 --> 01:11:10.920
thank you. Yeah, go ahead, Dan. Okay. Hi. Hi, Dennis. I missed the beginning of your talk,

01:11:10.920 --> 01:11:17.400
but I think this is a really important line of inquiry and my apology for exploring this.

01:11:18.120 --> 01:11:28.360
Um, I, I feel like the area which needs to be fleshed out more is the selection

01:11:29.240 --> 01:11:38.840
mechanism. And I wanted to mention that there is an existing theory called neural Darwinism,

01:11:40.120 --> 01:11:44.360
but it seems to be that theory is more on the, to explain perception

01:11:45.240 --> 01:11:54.040
rather than the formation of ideas. And in, in neural Darwinism, the idea is you have,

01:11:54.040 --> 01:11:59.720
you have basically a bunch of, when, when, when, in a newborn brain, it's known like you have tons

01:11:59.720 --> 01:12:07.720
of random connections and then there's sort of a pruning process. And the idea of neural Darwinism is

01:12:08.440 --> 01:12:15.000
the different groups of neurons are selected by how faithfully they replicate the incoming

01:12:15.640 --> 01:12:27.240
sensory data streams. With your, with your theory, you, you were talking about more of an internal

01:12:27.240 --> 01:12:37.000
process, right? So I was thinking, when, when you need some kind of like world simulator,

01:12:37.720 --> 01:12:44.440
to, to, to test different ideas, to see if it makes sense. And like, have you thought about how

01:12:44.440 --> 01:12:54.920
there might be like a world simulator and then basically, so for example, with the missing

01:12:54.920 --> 01:13:01.240
keys example, which is, which is really interesting one example, different parts of your brain would,

01:13:01.240 --> 01:13:11.000
would be simulating different scenarios and sort of seeing if they, if, if,

01:13:15.160 --> 01:13:21.880
if the idea, if, if the simulation maps onto the idea, like, like you'd have different ideas,

01:13:24.440 --> 01:13:30.440
like you'd have an idea of the keys or location X, and then you'd run a simulation based on the,

01:13:30.440 --> 01:13:36.120
all the information you know, and you see if it confirms that idea. Have you thought about anything

01:13:36.120 --> 01:13:50.360
like that? Well, just to give a general answer, the, as I, as I said earlier, I like to just

01:13:50.360 --> 01:13:59.000
leave sense data out of it completely. I mean, I do think that sense data is important to, to test

01:13:59.000 --> 01:14:07.400
your theories. But so to make progress, sense data is important in that sense, but I don't think sense

01:14:07.400 --> 01:14:13.160
data is required for, for creativity to work, or for any of the evolution that occurs in a mind to

01:14:13.160 --> 01:14:20.360
work. And I mean, you could, you could simply ask, you know, if somebody is born, and I don't want to

01:14:20.360 --> 01:14:23.560
put words in his mind, I think David does this in the beginning of infinity, and if somebody is born

01:14:23.560 --> 01:14:29.400
blind, they're not any less creative. I mean, they might, they're still people. They're fully

01:14:29.400 --> 01:14:35.160
qualified people, right? So they might have a harder time correcting some errors because they

01:14:35.160 --> 01:14:40.680
don't have access to sense data from the eyes, but then they might creatively find other ways to,

01:14:40.680 --> 01:14:47.000
to correct those errors. But what I, like I said, what I like to do is just leave sense data out of

01:14:47.000 --> 01:14:54.600
it completely just to avoid any empiricist pitfalls. And I also like to leave the brain out of it

01:14:54.600 --> 01:15:01.320
completely. And I like to think only in terms of the mind, just to avoid any, any accidental

01:15:01.320 --> 01:15:06.840
reductionist mistakes. So I, so I, you know, the thing about neuronal structure is self replicating.

01:15:08.280 --> 01:15:13.640
I don't know. I would, I was more just mentioning that for the audience's

01:15:14.600 --> 01:15:20.600
benefit, not, not, I'm not saying that you should go in that direction. I actually think the

01:15:20.600 --> 01:15:25.720
direction you're going, which is more at the higher, higher level, extracting away from the,

01:15:27.480 --> 01:15:32.200
from the, the neural circuitry is, is, is very, is very interesting.

01:15:35.560 --> 01:15:41.880
As I guess my question was really about the selection mechanism, like could, could you

01:15:41.880 --> 01:15:46.840
elaborate more? Cause so far on the selection mechanism, cause so far you, I mean, at least for

01:15:46.840 --> 01:15:54.040
the part I heard, you just mentioned, you know, some will be better at replicating than others, but

01:15:56.040 --> 01:16:03.960
um, what is the selection? How is, how does selection occur? Is it context dependent or is

01:16:04.040 --> 01:16:11.720
there some, how does that, how does that work? Yeah. So again, borrowing Dawkins definition of

01:16:11.720 --> 01:16:16.600
selection, that is, it's the non random differential reproduction of a replicator in a pool of

01:16:16.600 --> 01:16:23.240
replicators. Um, that is how I would describe the selection effect or the selection mechanism

01:16:23.240 --> 01:16:28.200
in the pool of self replicating ideas in the mind as well. It's just the fact that once a

01:16:28.200 --> 01:16:35.480
mutation arises, if the mutation either helps or harms the, the new copies ability to spread,

01:16:35.480 --> 01:16:40.280
now you have differences in the rate of replication and that itself constitutes selection.

01:16:40.280 --> 01:16:46.760
In addition to that, um, the, the, this meta algorithm, which by the way caught myself

01:16:46.760 --> 01:16:51.240
not crediting the, uh, this, the, the idea of the meta algorithm originated with

01:16:51.800 --> 01:16:58.440
a temple in a different context, but the, the meta algorithm could also, um,

01:17:00.520 --> 01:17:08.040
have, you know, act as a sort of arbiter of ideas or select or arbiters, but impose additional

01:17:08.040 --> 01:17:15.640
selection pressures on the idea pool. Um, now how in detail that would work, I think is depends on

01:17:15.640 --> 01:17:24.200
what happens at runtime, um, because it might, it might, um, look at some ideas for what to do

01:17:24.200 --> 01:17:29.720
and what selection pressures to enact on the idea pool itself. So there's some kind of feedback

01:17:29.720 --> 01:17:33.240
loop there, but the details of it, the kinks I think need to be worked out there.

01:17:38.040 --> 01:17:45.400
Okay. Then we have two questions in the chat by Taha. The first one is in the case of genes,

01:17:46.200 --> 01:17:52.600
RNA, DNA, uh, we know what the replication unit is made of, a sequence of nucleotides.

01:17:53.240 --> 01:17:56.200
What constitutes the replication unit of an, of an idea?

01:17:58.280 --> 01:18:06.120
Yes, this is a great question. Um, I would, uh, I would follow Dawkins here who, who says, well,

01:18:06.680 --> 01:18:11.160
you know, on the one hand we have the, the physical instance of the replicator,

01:18:12.040 --> 01:18:21.560
um, which is the molecular structure itself. Um, but, um, so actually the terminology I use is that

01:18:22.440 --> 01:18:26.680
that I would call an instance of a replicator, a physical instance of that replicator. And

01:18:26.680 --> 01:18:31.720
although maybe I'm jumbling biological terms, but I would consider even that, um, physical

01:18:31.720 --> 01:18:37.640
instance of that string of molecules itself, part of that replicator's phenotype, which may sound

01:18:37.720 --> 01:18:42.280
a bit confusing until you realize that the replicator itself is actually an abstraction.

01:18:43.080 --> 01:18:49.640
Um, the replicator is not physical. It has physical instant physical instantiations,

01:18:49.640 --> 01:18:56.040
but the replicator is an abstraction because as Dawkins explains, the replicator is that part of

01:18:56.040 --> 01:19:01.880
this, this string of DNA that manages to stay the same over many, many generations for, you know,

01:19:01.880 --> 01:19:09.720
for as long as possible. And so this is just a chain of instances and that, of course, that chain

01:19:09.720 --> 01:19:15.800
physically exists, but it also exists over time. And so some of the older chains, some of the older

01:19:15.800 --> 01:19:19.320
part of the chain would already be gone at that point. And still we would consider all that part

01:19:19.320 --> 01:19:25.720
of the same replicator. So it's abstract. Those are independent of the, the physical instantiation.

01:19:26.440 --> 01:19:34.360
Um, but so the unit of, the unit of replication, in that sense, we could ask the same question

01:19:34.360 --> 01:19:43.880
also when it comes to memes. Um, in the mind, I think are, are again these, the, again, at the

01:19:43.880 --> 01:19:48.600
risk of sounding too technical, the functions in the sense of the lambda calculus, these little

01:19:48.600 --> 01:19:54.360
programs, just think of them as programs, really. Um, those are the ones that replicate. And of

01:19:54.360 --> 01:19:59.880
course they're going to have a physical instantiation in the physical memory now again, in the sense of

01:19:59.880 --> 01:20:06.440
storing stuff, not in the sense of remembering stuff in the brain. Um, I think Dawkins even went

01:20:06.440 --> 01:20:13.560
so far as to say one time that, you know, he proposed this conjecture that maybe we, if, if you have a

01:20:13.560 --> 01:20:17.480
joke in your mind and I have a joke in my mind or in your brain, I have a joke in my brain,

01:20:17.480 --> 01:20:21.880
that maybe that means that the neuronal structures and coding that joke are the same. So maybe

01:20:22.840 --> 01:20:29.080
meme replication implies, uh, replication of neuronal structures across brains or something.

01:20:29.880 --> 01:20:34.440
Um, actually I think I'm getting ahead of myself here. Um, so the replication unit of an idea

01:20:35.400 --> 01:20:39.960
is the function in the sense of the lambda calculus. I hope that helps.

01:20:40.680 --> 01:20:46.920
Yes, I think it makes sense. Just get a clear picture for myself. Do you mean that, uh,

01:20:47.400 --> 01:20:52.280
there is, there is something that you and I have in common when we have the same idea in, in our

01:20:52.280 --> 01:20:57.080
minds, or that we have a similarity when we have the same joke, then whatever is encoding that joke

01:20:57.080 --> 01:21:07.880
in our, uh, in our brains has to be, uh, fundamentally the same thing. Like it is, it is encoding the

01:21:07.880 --> 01:21:12.520
same abstraction, as you would say. And it might do so differently. It might use a different encoding,

01:21:12.520 --> 01:21:16.760
a different encoding, but it is, they're both encoding the same abstractions in that sense.

01:21:17.960 --> 01:21:23.240
Yeah, provided that enough error correction has gone into it, the, the, I agree, the abstraction

01:21:23.240 --> 01:21:31.080
that, that encodes the idea in your mind should be roughly at least similar to, to the encoding

01:21:31.080 --> 01:21:36.600
in my mind. Yes. Right. Okay. And then there's the second question, uh, also from Taha, uh,

01:21:36.600 --> 01:21:41.560
which goes knowing that the sequence of a gene allows us to target it with a strip of DNA,

01:21:42.600 --> 01:21:45.880
how can we do the same and target this specific idea?

01:21:48.040 --> 01:21:54.280
Yeah. Um, that's also a really great question. Uh, well, if you, maybe we can go back to the,

01:21:54.280 --> 01:21:58.680
the thought experiment I suggested earlier with the, with the brain interface that allows you to

01:21:58.680 --> 01:22:04.200
connect to someone's brain and, you know, read the source code. I don't know how exactly you would

01:22:04.200 --> 01:22:11.640
do that, but if you somehow manage to, and I think that process itself would involve

01:22:12.520 --> 01:22:19.160
conjecture and refutation. So the brain interface may need to be a person, but, um,

01:22:20.200 --> 01:22:26.680
if somehow you manage to do that and you, you can turn the zeros and ones in the brain somehow back

01:22:26.680 --> 01:22:33.080
into, um, functions, you know, represent them as functions in the sense of the Lambda calculus,

01:22:33.080 --> 01:22:37.240
then what you could do is you, at any point in that source code, you could make modifications or

01:22:38.280 --> 01:22:42.520
split it or put something new in there. Um, all this stuff would be available to you.

01:22:43.320 --> 01:22:46.600
Seems to me a challenge to, to make that happen, that, that interface.

01:22:48.040 --> 01:22:54.600
Great. Um, then yeah, we, uh, we're almost through the 45 minutes

01:22:55.960 --> 01:23:01.320
and I don't see any further questions, uh, unless someone has them now in which case,

01:23:01.640 --> 01:23:08.680
please, please go ahead and ask. Um, uh, yeah, go ahead. Yeah, if you don't mind me asking a

01:23:08.680 --> 01:23:15.400
second one, that's okay. So I was just wondering about like, uh, so do you think, uh, a conflict

01:23:15.400 --> 01:23:23.480
or problems are a necessary precondition for a conjecture or, uh, because I was thinking about,

01:23:23.480 --> 01:23:31.560
like in order for us to, um, identify a problem, would we first need to conjecture that a problem

01:23:31.560 --> 01:23:36.520
exists? So in other words, there's like, let's take a simplistic, probably unrealistically

01:23:36.520 --> 01:23:45.480
simplistic case. There's two conflicting ideas. Um, and, uh, we're, we're conjecturing solutions to

01:23:45.480 --> 01:23:53.320
that problem. Do we need to conjecture that there is a problem? Uh, and then like just as a related

01:23:53.320 --> 01:24:00.040
idea, uh, in order to conjecture anything in order for any new variation of an idea to, to come about,

01:24:00.840 --> 01:24:05.160
does that kind of conflict need to, need to exist? If that makes sense.

01:24:06.760 --> 01:24:15.480
Um, I think the answer is no for, because new ideas will just evolve by virtue of replication

01:24:15.480 --> 01:24:25.640
being imperfect over time. Um, but when there is a conflict between ideas, um, that certainly

01:24:25.640 --> 01:24:31.640
helps. And I would imagine that at least that is the main thing. Like I said, that we're consciously

01:24:31.640 --> 01:24:37.560
aware of when we do come up with a new conjecture is, is because it is in response to a problem. So

01:24:37.560 --> 01:24:42.040
I still think that problems are the raw material of creativity and so forth. Um, but strictly

01:24:42.040 --> 01:24:48.920
speaking, no conjectures could arise just by virtue of, of imperfect replication. Okay. Okay. Thanks.

01:24:51.640 --> 01:24:53.880
Okay. Uh, any other questions?

01:24:58.360 --> 01:25:05.080
Antonio, go ahead. Thank you. Um, do you think there's a difference between

01:25:06.040 --> 01:25:13.000
the perception of a problem, so this conflict between ideas and sensory perception in general?

01:25:17.000 --> 01:25:23.640
Um, could you elaborate a little more? Yeah. Do you think there is, I mean, when you realize

01:25:23.640 --> 01:25:32.120
that there is a conflict between two ideas, isn't this something you perceive via your senses?

01:25:33.080 --> 01:25:41.320
Is there, is it a different physical structure, say from vision or from looking at the screen or

01:25:41.320 --> 01:25:47.160
recognizing a bicycle? When you recognize that there is a problem between two ideas,

01:25:47.880 --> 01:25:55.800
do you think it's a different object in a way than recognizing a physical object around you?

01:25:56.360 --> 01:26:03.800
Um, I think those are, those are different things. Um, when we experience a problem,

01:26:04.840 --> 01:26:11.400
um, experience, yeah. Right. When we experience a problem, I mean, maybe I use the term experience

01:26:11.400 --> 01:26:16.520
differently, but this, the sensation we have, sensations also tricky term because it has sense,

01:26:17.400 --> 01:26:22.040
but the, the sensation we have when we experience a problem with cognitive dissonance

01:26:23.000 --> 01:26:28.600
need not result from sense data. It certainly can happen that you're, you know, with an optical

01:26:28.600 --> 01:26:32.040
illusion, for example, you think you're looking at one thing, but it's actually another and you

01:26:32.040 --> 01:26:35.080
can change, if you change your perspective, you see, and then you experience that problem,

01:26:35.080 --> 01:26:38.600
that's a problem you want to solve, but the experience of the problem itself

01:26:39.720 --> 01:26:45.320
as all experience, I think, is entirely within. That is not something that is induced somehow by,

01:26:45.320 --> 01:26:53.000
by sensory data. And again, if I agree, I agree, but they're both inside, both when you perceive

01:26:53.000 --> 01:26:59.080
a bicycle on the road and when you perceive a problem in your mind, both of them are inside you.

01:26:59.640 --> 01:27:06.360
That's what I'm saying. Is there a difference? Yes. I think there's still a difference when

01:27:06.360 --> 01:27:11.240
you just look at a bicycle and say you have, you know, I imagine that children learn this when

01:27:11.240 --> 01:27:16.920
they're very young, they, they creatively conjecture recognition algorithms like shape

01:27:16.920 --> 01:27:21.960
recognition algorithms so that later they can recognize bicycles. That stuff just happens

01:27:21.960 --> 01:27:28.200
automatically. Once you see it, once you've created that algorithm, you just recognize bicycles,

01:27:28.200 --> 01:27:34.760
unless you're horribly deformed or something. Whereas when you have a problem, there's something

01:27:35.880 --> 01:27:40.760
unknown there. There's something mysterious there. So I still think those are qualitatively

01:27:40.840 --> 01:27:45.240
different experiences. If that, if maybe if that's where you're getting at it, I don't know if I'm

01:27:45.240 --> 01:27:53.640
answering the question. Okay. I don't think there is a difference, but yeah. Well, can you elaborate?

01:27:53.640 --> 01:27:58.360
What, what is it? You think that is the same about it? I mean, at some point to a child,

01:27:59.720 --> 01:28:05.400
seeing a bicycle was a mystery in the same way that when you think about supernovae or whatever,

01:28:06.120 --> 01:28:13.320
it's a mystery for you. Right. There is no automatic thing going on. I mean, if at some point,

01:28:14.440 --> 01:28:20.840
because if you're never exposed to bicycle, then you can be as old as you want, but at some point,

01:28:21.560 --> 01:28:30.200
you will be mystified by this new object. So I see. Yeah, no, I think you're right that when,

01:28:30.200 --> 01:28:34.280
for the, when, for the first time you see a bicycle that is a mystery, you know, what is that thing,

01:28:34.280 --> 01:28:41.400
how does it work and how would I recognize it again? At like that first time, you're confronted

01:28:41.400 --> 01:28:45.960
with a problem and you want to solve that problem. And in response to it, you learn about the bicycle

01:28:45.960 --> 01:28:51.080
and you come up with a shape recognition algorithm for the bicycle and so forth. But once you have that,

01:28:52.520 --> 01:28:56.280
now it's automatic. Now you can just recognize bicycles again. If I look at the window and I

01:28:56.280 --> 01:29:03.080
see a bicycle that doesn't constitute a problem. So I would, I would still consider those two

01:29:03.080 --> 01:29:14.760
different things. Well, fair enough. Yeah, I think aren't they just the same thing only one is subjected

01:29:14.760 --> 01:29:23.800
to empirical criticism and the other is just an internal idea. I'm maybe well. Yeah. I mean,

01:29:23.800 --> 01:29:30.760
your internal ideas, aren't they criticism? How do you experience? How do you think?

01:29:31.720 --> 01:29:34.520
Don't you visualize your objections to something?

01:29:36.920 --> 01:29:40.520
Why do we need to distinguish between these two worlds?

01:29:41.480 --> 01:29:45.960
It's the same distinction as between science and philosophy, I think. And it's not really a

01:29:45.960 --> 01:29:52.280
distinction. It's just a matter of where the criticisms come from. And it's useful in some

01:29:52.280 --> 01:29:59.240
cases, but this is not a fundamental distinction, I think. I'm not sure if Dennis agrees with that,

01:29:59.720 --> 01:30:06.920
this is how I would understand that. I do, although I still have the feeling that I can't

01:30:06.920 --> 01:30:12.360
quite put my finger on, on what's your name, Antonio's question. So I feel that I haven't

01:30:12.360 --> 01:30:22.840
really answered it satisfactorily. Yeah, well, maybe a topic for future discussion. I'm

01:30:22.840 --> 01:30:30.120
afraid we've run out of time, though. And yeah, I just want to thank Dennis for his great talk. I

01:30:30.120 --> 01:30:39.160
will do so as usual with appalling in emoji. There you go. And that was a lot of fun. It was

01:30:39.160 --> 01:30:43.960
great to be here. Yeah, yeah. Thanks so much for coming. And again, I encourage everyone to check

01:30:43.960 --> 01:30:49.960
out your article on the Conjection Magazine website, which we'll link to in the description of the

01:30:49.960 --> 01:30:58.600
video. And yeah, so thank you for Logan for helping range this. Thank you and good luck.

01:30:58.600 --> 01:31:03.720
Yeah, thank you. Okay, goodbye. Thank you, everybody.
