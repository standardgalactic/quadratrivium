Checking The Weekend University/Donald Hoffman - Consciousness, Mysteries Beyond Spacetime, and Waking up from the Dream of Life.txt
 In this episode of the Weekend University Podcast, Neil Said, the host, engages in a thought-provoking conversation with Donald Hoffman, a professor and cognitive scientist at the University of California, Irvine. They discuss topics ranging from perception to consciousness and the implications for our understanding of reality.

Professor Hoffman's research suggests that our perceptual systems are directly linked to an underlying reality and that our conscious experience emerges from a deeper, more fundamental layer of reality that is not computational or informational. He introduces the concept of "objects of consciousness" and "fusions of consciousness," which are part of his ongoing research in positive geometry, a mathematical framework that he believes can describe the structure of consciousness.

Hoffman emphasizes that there is no theory of everything in physics, which indicates that there is a fundamental mystery at the core of our universe. He sees a future where science and spirituality can interact profitably, as both fields explore the nature of this mystery.

For those interested in Hoffman's work, he recommends looking up his papers on objects of consciousness and fusions of consciousness via Google Scholar. He also has postdoc positions available for individuals with recent PhDs in algebraic geometry. Hoffman is active online, with a Twitter feed and YouTube channel where he shares his ideas and videos, including this one.

Hoffman's book, "The Case Against Reality," provides a deeper dive into some of the arguments discussed, particularly regarding the evolutionary perspective on consciousness. He acknowledges that through his work, he may be inadvertently reintroducing mystery and spirituality to those who approach science with a strictly empirical mindset.

Neil Said highlights the importance of what Hoffman is doing, as it opens up the possibility of integrating mystery and spirituality into a scientific worldview. He notes that at the heart of this endeavor lies the recognition that we are part of the mystery we seek to understand.
