00:00.000 --> 00:25.320
The questions that Hussle raises are incredibly deep, and I don't know that one seminar is

00:25.320 --> 00:36.720
sufficient to expose this depth to you, but I know the readings are very difficult and I can

00:36.720 --> 00:44.600
explain the readings, so that's a small victory. Are you threatening us with the more Hussle seminars?

00:44.600 --> 00:53.160
Yeah, let's talk about that a little. What you have here is a selection of

00:53.440 --> 01:04.720
short passages, which in itself makes it difficult, from five different texts. That is,

01:04.720 --> 01:13.680
logical investigations, ideas, formal and transcendental logic, the crisis of the European

01:13.680 --> 01:21.240
sciences, and the origin of geometry, and that's the order in which they were written from 1899

01:21.240 --> 01:40.920
to 1936, 37 maybe. Normally, I gave them to you in the order that they were written,

01:40.920 --> 01:45.400
because it seemed logical, and that's how I'll explain it, because they built up on it,

01:45.400 --> 01:52.200
but actually I read them in reverse order. That is, I read the crisis and the geometry first,

01:52.200 --> 02:00.920
because Harold told me to, and that's what he considered was most important, and they're the

02:00.920 --> 02:07.240
most relevant and most accessible to sociologists, because they ask social questions and historical

02:07.240 --> 02:15.880
questions. From there, I worked back to ideas and formal and transcendental logic in the middle

02:15.880 --> 02:23.280
space, and at the very last, I did the 700-page, two-volume, tome logical investigations, working

02:23.280 --> 02:31.080
with one of the world's top Heideggerian scholars, Frederick Golovsson, over six months in a graduate

02:31.400 --> 02:38.000
seminar, and that's the most obscure, and so you're starting out reading the most obscure,

02:38.000 --> 02:49.400
and you're reading short selections, so don't blame yourself if it was hard. However, Husserl did

02:49.400 --> 02:57.160
have a very important influence on garfinkel, and it's an influence that has been underestimated

02:57.160 --> 03:04.200
by most people who never studied with garfinkel. Originally, they just read Husserl out, because

03:04.200 --> 03:11.880
they just didn't have an interest themselves, I think. I'm not sure why. They got that he was

03:11.880 --> 03:17.000
interested in Wittgenstein, and he was, but he was always more interested in Husserl, and of course

03:17.000 --> 03:26.840
they treat, they address similar issues. That denial has been transformed in recent years, judging

03:26.840 --> 03:33.480
from what I read and the emails I get, to a kind of theory of a term. Heidegger has this term,

03:33.480 --> 03:38.760
the early Heidegger and the late Heidegger. Well, they have developed a kind of account of garfinkel

03:38.760 --> 03:46.600
that he was a phenomenologist, and somehow later rejected Husserl and rejected the phenomenology.

03:46.600 --> 03:51.480
He never rejected it. He wrote, he had an article on Husserl, one of the last articles he ever wrote

03:51.480 --> 03:58.840
in human studies. He never took phenomenology on its own terms. He only took anything on his terms,

04:00.040 --> 04:05.720
and it's a very unique reading, and it's a very valuable reading, and it's the kind of reading

04:05.720 --> 04:13.880
that I'm doing, and giving. But the vitality of ethnomethodology, at least the vitality of

04:13.880 --> 04:22.440
garfinkel's project, started with his reading of Husserl. That's where he got the energy and the

04:22.440 --> 04:26.440
interest. And that becomes very clear if you read his doctoral dissertation, which is now available

04:26.440 --> 04:36.120
in book form in this, in this book, I think it's paradigm press edited by Anne Rawls called

04:36.120 --> 04:45.480
Seeing Sociologically 2006. It's a fairly easy read, actually. And it's very clear that Husserl

04:45.480 --> 04:56.600
particularly played an important role in his formative stages when he was first grappling with

04:56.600 --> 05:04.360
how to study ordinary society. Of course, he was reading after World War II in the late 40s

05:04.360 --> 05:09.400
and through the 50s, and there were no English translations then of Husserl. I think the first

05:09.400 --> 05:21.800
translations of anything serious was in 62 by an Australian. And, you know, it's, he was reading

05:21.800 --> 05:33.480
Marvin Farber, he was reading Maurice Nathanson, he was reading Aaron Gervitch, who summarized

05:33.480 --> 05:39.640
Husserl's arguments in their English language articles. And this is what he lived and breathed

05:39.640 --> 05:48.600
in the late 40s and early 50s. And then he started paying students when he became a professor to

05:48.600 --> 05:53.160
translate from the German, because he didn't read German himself, although he had a good sense for

05:53.160 --> 06:00.440
the, for the energy of the language. He had, he would hire students to translate Husserlian text

06:00.440 --> 06:07.560
from, that were only available in English and German into English. So for people to say, oh he

06:07.560 --> 06:16.120
wasn't, Husserl wasn't a big influence, it's complete nonsense. But, and, but you, you should be free

06:17.720 --> 06:23.560
not to read Husserl if you don't want to. I mean some of his close students chose

06:23.880 --> 06:36.520
not. And you, you're, everybody, you know, it's a free life. But you can't say that, that Husserl

06:36.520 --> 06:44.760
didn't play a role. I mean you don't get to do that. I remember one of my first professors was

06:44.760 --> 06:50.600
Peter Berger, who wrote The Social Construction of Reality. And I was telling him I love phenomenology.

06:50.600 --> 06:55.640
And he was saying, well how, how do you know phenomenology? I said, well partly your book,

06:55.640 --> 07:01.320
and I read a bit of Schultz and a bit of Heidegger and Marvin Farber, because that's the guy who

07:01.320 --> 07:10.920
brought phenomenology to America. And he said, yeah, he said everybody loves Heidegger, everybody loves

07:10.920 --> 07:17.240
reading Merleau-Plenty, there's so, all the existential stuff people like. But the real me

07:17.240 --> 07:27.320
is Husserl's phenomenology and nobody has the patience to read that. And so, so I, I, I took

07:27.320 --> 07:34.360
that as a challenge. Right? Okay. And I ended up reading it all. So, so I felt I satisfied

07:35.080 --> 07:45.080
one of my first teacher's efforts to, to, to teach me. Now I could have started this series of

07:45.080 --> 07:55.800
lectures long ago with, with Husserl, if I was going to do it logically. But I started with the

07:55.800 --> 08:05.480
juicy stuff, you know, because I, I wanted you to enjoy phenomenology. So we read Heidegger, we read

08:05.480 --> 08:14.360
Merleau-Plenty, and we read Manheim and Schultz. And last, we're doing Husserl. But we're going to take

08:15.080 --> 08:30.680
the order of his writings in the, in the toughest first, I guess. But, but I'll tell you, I, I, I

08:30.760 --> 08:38.280
think Garfunkel is a person who's very difficult to read, but each reading creates something new.

08:41.480 --> 08:47.080
And I think Husserl's the same way. I'm still discovering stuff in him. I mean, I love, one of

08:47.080 --> 08:54.280
the reasons I like giving seminars on him is that, especially the one I did using the Spanish texts

08:54.280 --> 09:00.120
in Buenos Aires, you know, in Spanish, I discovered, I never noticed that before. And I go back to the

09:00.120 --> 09:05.480
English and sure it's there all along. But I think you know well after having read through this stuff,

09:05.480 --> 09:12.440
it's possible for your eyes to slide across the page and not, and not capture things. But when

09:12.440 --> 09:17.560
you're reading the foreign language, you're forced to go more slowly. So it's actually a good way to,

09:18.440 --> 09:25.160
to get a fresh look on something you've already read. So I'm, I'm, I'm obviously excited about

09:25.160 --> 09:32.440
Husserl, one of the, one of the few, right, which, which ought to drum me out of, out of any parties.

09:35.640 --> 09:41.640
Okay, so let's, let's start. I hope we can finish. You ought to be able to ask lots of questions,

09:41.640 --> 09:45.480
because I think questions are good when you don't understand. But I don't think we're going to be

09:45.480 --> 09:52.600
able to do questions and get through this. So we'll have to choose at some point to get through or,

09:52.600 --> 10:01.160
or to ask the question. The, let's start with logic investigations. The chapter three title

10:02.040 --> 10:10.120
is, I mean, you see the page is 312, right? So if chapter three is at 312, you know you've been

10:10.120 --> 10:16.280
in for a while. Actually, it's the introduction, which you ought to read, which takes out most of

10:16.280 --> 10:22.280
those pages. The chapter title is called Fluctuation in Meaning and the Ideality of Unities of

10:22.280 --> 10:29.720
Meaning. So we're looking at fluctuation and immunities of meaning, which ought to be,

10:29.720 --> 10:36.360
on the face of it, a fascinating topic, right? And he talks about, if you read the first sentence

10:36.360 --> 10:44.520
in our last chapter, we dealt with the act of meaning. Just to see meaning as an act is something

10:44.520 --> 10:50.200
that, that is turning philosophy into a social science, because an act is something people do.

10:52.280 --> 11:01.800
And that's what phenomenology looks at, is acts. Later in the paragraph, he talks about the shifting

11:01.800 --> 11:10.200
acts of meanings. It's this flux of relations. How do these meanings shift? He can't talk about this

11:11.320 --> 11:17.400
without looking at social phenomena, without looking at communication, because that's why

11:17.400 --> 11:23.880
the meaning is shifting. It isn't shifting all by itself. I mean, I suppose you could have a study

11:23.880 --> 11:29.960
of somebody whose meaning, understanding changes as they read through, but he is looking at social

11:29.960 --> 11:40.120
things and understand he spent much of his life thinking about these issues in, in conjunction

11:40.120 --> 11:51.400
with, with a fellow German-Jewish scholar and Garrick Simmel. And they corresponded and he

11:51.400 --> 11:57.960
read his books, his Simmel's books. And I think you see the dialogue. A lot of this stuff, I think,

11:57.960 --> 12:03.480
originates with some of Simmel's madness. At least there, there's the influence there.

12:04.440 --> 12:15.080
So this, on, on, on the bottom of that paragraph, where he says five lines up, expressions whose

12:15.080 --> 12:22.520
meaning shifts. It's just, this is a fascinating topic. It's, I wanted to teach my students this,

12:22.520 --> 12:29.960
and I'm not going to teach students by reading Hustl, at least not sociology students who are

12:29.960 --> 12:35.640
graduates and in some cases undergraduates. Actually, in this case, it was undergraduates,

12:35.640 --> 12:40.840
because I decided I was going to teach them about expressions whose meaning shifts by having them

12:40.840 --> 12:48.040
go out and study coffee tasting. And they went out and filmed people tasting coffee and looked at how

12:48.040 --> 12:54.920
those descriptors changed their meaning over the course of the cup. Some of them were professionals

12:54.920 --> 13:00.840
and some of them were, were lay consumers. And it was such a great topic, it became a major

13:01.800 --> 13:09.560
research topic for me. It's great fun. I mean, there's nothing more fun in the world than

13:09.560 --> 13:16.600
studying the shifting of sense. I mean, it really, it really, it makes you less absolute in your

13:16.600 --> 13:25.400
personality and character. I mean, it makes you dance to the ironies of life. And so, so,

13:26.760 --> 13:33.240
so he's got a good handhold. And the question then is, how do these shifting meanings become

13:33.240 --> 13:41.880
communities of me? How do, how do we tame this, this amorphous beast so that we can get on with

13:41.880 --> 13:51.720
things? And, and that's what he's studying. And that involves social work. When people create what

13:51.720 --> 13:59.640
he calls objectivated forms, he says in the next section, 25, that there can be two kinds.

14:00.280 --> 14:09.080
There can be kinds that have some intimations. Those in the third line of section 25 on 312.

14:09.080 --> 14:14.840
Those that also intimate what they name. Intimate, he defines in the last section,

14:14.840 --> 14:23.960
in the last sentence of this section, if we limit on 313. If we limit intimation in the

14:23.960 --> 14:29.880
narrower sense to experiences which carry an expression's meaning. So, so there are some

14:30.440 --> 14:36.680
expressions that you know what just what they mean. It's, it's sort of clear. But then there are also

14:36.680 --> 14:45.880
those. He says, quote, in whose case named and intimated contents follow us under, that they,

14:45.880 --> 14:50.600
they don't nobody knows what they mean. They don't even might not even know themselves what they mean.

14:51.000 --> 15:05.000
And it's, it's, it's like an empty pallet or an empty shell that the name is there. There's an

15:05.000 --> 15:12.280
objectivation. There's an expression. People are focusing on the expression. But it's like an empty

15:12.280 --> 15:26.360
pallet. It still remains to determine its content. And so it's, it's, it's, you know, inherently a,

15:27.320 --> 15:34.120
a social phenomenon because it presents local parties, we would call them members,

15:34.760 --> 15:40.280
with the task of turning those objectivated forms into something that people can understand together

15:40.360 --> 15:47.800
and can work with. And so that's a practical task that people face. And that's what Garfinkel

15:47.800 --> 15:56.680
was up to all his life. There's no earlier, later. If you look on, on section 26,

15:59.720 --> 16:03.960
he speaks of essentially occasional and objective expressions.

16:04.520 --> 16:17.160
And he speaks in the middle of 314. Right after the question mark just above the middle on 314,

16:18.040 --> 16:26.680
can we there still stick to self identical meaning unities? So meaning unities has to do with how

16:26.680 --> 16:35.400
do we, how do we make these, these meanings unified? How do we produce unified meanings

16:35.400 --> 16:40.680
so that, so that it's clear what they mean and so that everybody's clear about what they mean?

16:40.680 --> 16:48.280
That's what, what he means by objective. And, and of course, because he's doing phenomenology,

16:48.280 --> 16:53.320
the how of that is much more interesting to him than the what.

16:57.480 --> 17:05.320
It, the self identity, self identical means it, it keeps the meaning as,

17:06.680 --> 17:13.880
as the event develops and even the next day, you have a meaning unity that remains the same,

17:13.880 --> 17:19.400
but it doesn't remain the same all by itself. It remains the same because of the work

17:19.400 --> 17:27.080
that the parties are doing to sustain that unity of sense. So we're interested in just how

17:28.120 --> 17:36.920
that those members produce that unity of sense as a major task. It might be the

17:37.880 --> 17:49.800
social activity synchrono. He speaks on 314 just below the middle. He's got two italicized

17:50.440 --> 17:57.800
phrases. The first is, and I've written it up here, essentially subjective and occasional expressions.

17:58.360 --> 18:09.080
And he defines that at the top of 315. He says, on the other hand, we call an expression essentially

18:09.080 --> 18:15.160
subjective and occasional or more briefly, essentially occasional, if it belongs to a

18:15.160 --> 18:22.200
conceptually unified group of possible meaning. In whose case, it is essential to orient actual

18:22.200 --> 18:31.400
meaning to the occasion, the speaker and the situation. That's basically indexicality, right?

18:32.520 --> 18:41.560
It's, it's, it's, it's meanings the way they happen in the real world. They have an indexical

18:41.560 --> 18:51.320
character to them. But then he talks about objective expressions, the second term in italics.

18:52.920 --> 19:03.960
And he defines that on 314 in that next paragraph. We shall call an expression objective if it

19:03.960 --> 19:11.320
pins down, or can pin down, its meaning merely by its manifest auditory pattern, and can be

19:11.320 --> 19:17.480
understood without necessarily directing one's attention to the person uttering it, or to the

19:17.480 --> 19:29.160
circumstances of the utterance. This is basically a definition of objective. But you, you feel

19:30.120 --> 19:36.920
Husserl's struggling in providing us with a definition of objective, because it's a very

19:36.920 --> 19:43.000
tough thing. And that's what's kept me doing my coffee research. Everybody uses the term objective,

19:43.000 --> 19:51.480
and everybody has a different idea. The way the term is used in society and in science varies

19:51.640 --> 19:59.080
dramatically. What is objective? That's a radical question. It's an ethnomethodological question,

19:59.080 --> 20:09.000
because it's what people are doing. And it's, it's, I mean, does what Husserl provides us here,

20:10.600 --> 20:15.880
if it, if it pins down its meaning merely by its manifest auditory pattern, and can be understood

20:15.880 --> 20:20.360
without necessarily directing one's attention to the person uttering it, does that exhaust the

20:20.360 --> 20:27.320
meaning of objectivity? What more can there be? Objectivities don't happen on their own,

20:27.320 --> 20:34.600
they involve practical work. And in an ethnomethodological way, I don't want to resolve,

20:35.400 --> 20:42.040
I don't want us to, to solve the problem, answer the question, what more can objective mean,

20:42.040 --> 20:51.080
by theorizing. I want to go out and watch people do it. And so Garfinkel did that. And

20:53.240 --> 20:59.720
toward the end of his teaching, he came up with this, this model of interaction in which

21:00.840 --> 21:11.000
the local work of accounting was, in fact, the practical work of people trying to continuously

21:11.080 --> 21:16.920
upgrade these subjective and occasional expressions with objective expressions.

21:18.280 --> 21:26.040
And, and you'll read in his writings, how, how they're always trying to get this substitution,

21:28.520 --> 21:33.880
that, that is to substitute the objective expression for the occasional expression,

21:33.880 --> 21:37.960
because it helps them organize the orderliness of their local affairs.

21:38.760 --> 21:44.360
Now, Garfinkel also was very suspicious of that, and in suspicion, he, he,

21:47.560 --> 21:52.760
I would say, cultivated during his reading of whistle's crisis, because that's the crisis of the

21:52.760 --> 22:00.440
European sciences. In their concern with objectivity, they forgot to see. That is, they forgot that

22:00.440 --> 22:07.480
there were these earlier moments of originality in which things were still in play, and that they,

22:07.480 --> 22:13.000
in fact, substituted those occasional expressions for objective expressions. So they lost the

22:13.000 --> 22:22.280
phenomenon. And so we, we are ever critical of objectivist, positivist strategies for losing

22:22.280 --> 22:31.720
the phenomenon. But, I think we can go too far with that criticism, because you need some degree

22:31.720 --> 22:40.840
of objectivation just to function. And I'm observing, witnessing, by going to the real world and

22:40.840 --> 22:48.040
looking at coffee tasters doing objective work, I'm realizing that the objectivities that they

22:48.040 --> 22:56.280
produce actually help them inquire into the flavors of coffee, that they'd be lost without

22:56.280 --> 23:05.560
those objectivities. But that doesn't mean that, that they can just settle for the objectivities

23:05.560 --> 23:12.520
and turn their minds off. They have to constantly realize that their, that those objectivities

23:12.520 --> 23:19.320
are social productions. Because those objectivities, those reductions, those formulations, those

23:19.320 --> 23:28.520
accounts will never exhaust the, the potential sense there is in worldly investigations, whether

23:28.520 --> 23:36.040
you're a geologist or a coffee taster. So if you're going to be original and discover, as I've said

23:36.040 --> 23:41.720
many times, what you need to know most, which is what it is you don't know, then you're going to

23:41.720 --> 23:48.840
need to be open. And that openness comes from doing the phenomenological bracketing. That is,

23:49.320 --> 23:54.680
understanding that these are production practices, that we are producing these objectivities and to

23:54.680 --> 24:03.000
understand the nature of their reality. And we'll talk about that in a second when we move to ideas.

24:05.400 --> 24:09.960
So this practical work consists of substituting the objective expressions for occasional

24:09.960 --> 24:16.440
expressions and its work that's never finished. The world being what it is. And so a lot of

24:16.440 --> 24:23.960
maintenance is required. And so ethomethodologists study this maintenance. This maintenance implies

24:24.600 --> 24:34.040
that, as he says, at the end of that large paragraph at the top, first half of page 314,

24:35.880 --> 24:41.640
that ends with a sentence. Obviously, we are here dealing with a case of unavoidable,

24:41.640 --> 24:47.640
rather than chance ambiguity, no kidding, one that cannot be removed from our language,

24:48.200 --> 24:54.200
one that cannot be removed from our life, he means to say, by an artificial device or convention.

24:55.000 --> 24:59.880
That is, the indeterminacy is the nature. And of course, Merleau-Ponty picked up on this big time,

24:59.880 --> 25:08.360
right? He wrote a lot about indeterminacy, which we, as members of the Enlightenment,

25:08.680 --> 25:16.200
Euro-Americans, civilized people, want to limit the indeterminacies because we want

25:16.200 --> 25:21.800
to be certain about everything. And we need certainty in order to believe our own propaganda.

25:21.800 --> 25:26.040
And it's a lot easier to proceed in our affairs when we believe our own propaganda. But these

25:26.040 --> 25:34.920
indeterminacies are very difficult, obviously, who so informs us. So I would say, as an aside,

25:35.000 --> 25:39.320
there are two kinds of people, some people who get disturbed at these indeterminacies,

25:39.320 --> 25:43.560
when the organized meaning falls apart, and those who get delighted by it,

25:44.600 --> 25:53.080
when it falls apart. We're the second kind. If you're disturbed when the meaning falls apart,

25:53.080 --> 26:02.840
and there's some researchers in our EMCA field who do get disturbed by that, although most don't,

26:03.800 --> 26:14.520
but there's some to do, then probably you should find some other meaningful academic or

26:14.520 --> 26:19.960
non-academic employment, right? You might become an accountant or something. Of course,

26:19.960 --> 26:26.600
do they probably know better the indeterminacies? Well, look at your text book, Indeterminacies.

26:27.480 --> 26:31.640
What's that? Look at your text book, Indeterminacies. I mean,

26:31.640 --> 26:37.880
there are a lot of indeterminacies even in the context. Oh, yeah, exactly. Yeah, the text is that.

26:40.200 --> 26:45.160
Actually, there's probably a third kind. Okay, so there's people who get disturbed by

26:45.160 --> 26:51.880
indeterminacies, people who celebrate and dance, everyone they discover. And I urge you to be that

26:51.880 --> 26:59.240
kind. But there's also a third kind, which is people either capitalists or politicians who seek

26:59.240 --> 27:05.720
to profit by each situation that comes apart. I imagine people like Napoleon were brilliant at

27:05.720 --> 27:18.760
that. But anyway, we're gonna have time for jokes. So, he says again at the bottom, six lines from

27:18.760 --> 27:24.440
the bottom of 314, that objectivity depends on the tenor of the talk already in progress.

27:25.880 --> 27:33.720
And the tendencies, it arouses. The tendencies talk arouses. My goodness, that seems social

27:33.720 --> 27:43.320
studying talk. Way back in 1899. I mean, that's really remarkable. Anyway, in these situations,

27:43.320 --> 27:51.640
we're very interested in learning just how expressions become objective. And across the page

27:51.640 --> 28:02.760
in the last phrase of that first paragraph on 315, he speaks about these expressions sometimes

28:03.560 --> 28:08.920
as having generally graspable, sufficiently reliable clues to guide the here to the meaning

28:09.000 --> 28:16.520
intended in the case in question. Okay? I mean, he's, you know, understand that he and Simmel

28:16.520 --> 28:21.880
didn't have tape recorders. That's the best that they could write. If you're gonna study talk,

28:22.840 --> 28:30.120
you know, sufficiently reliable clues to guide the here, right? But if he had transcripts and he

28:30.120 --> 28:35.880
had the tools that we had, I mean, I think he would have probably even done more work in this.

28:35.880 --> 28:42.280
Anyway, we're doing the work. So we ought to be happy. But it's not like Huschel's way over there,

28:42.920 --> 28:51.240
disconnected, in my view. Okay. And the next section, that's section 38.

28:53.960 --> 29:05.480
He's speaking about objectifying acts and noema. And don't be confused by noema. Noasis

29:05.480 --> 29:15.720
is the live thinking of your mind. Noema are products of that thinking, the transitory shifting

29:16.360 --> 29:25.240
objectivation of those thinking. That is in this diagram that I put up. If we're, if we're thinking,

29:26.200 --> 29:34.600
and I mean, a, a positive would say, okay, we just, we just see the facts and we're just

29:34.600 --> 29:42.680
representing what we see. But a phenomenologist realizes that in fact, we are projecting

29:44.280 --> 29:52.520
the sense on the object. We're seeing something in the light of our interests. So we're formulating

29:53.000 --> 30:05.560
it. And this, this, this, it's not strictly conceptual, but this is the noema. The, the,

30:05.560 --> 30:13.480
the framework through which our thinking passes that helps us, like coffee descriptors, to coordinate

30:14.200 --> 30:21.480
our deeper and ever deepening understanding of the object that we're investigating.

30:22.280 --> 30:30.120
So noema is, is, is this, it's like, it's like an account. It's like a term or it can be something

30:30.120 --> 30:37.320
less than that. He says that the function of objectivated noema is to hold and preserve

30:38.040 --> 30:45.080
or to present, that's a term he gets from Bentano, who was his teacher, right?

30:50.280 --> 31:01.960
To present formulated thoughts. And on page 130, on page 639, right, we're, we're moving a lot

31:01.960 --> 31:11.720
quickly in this. He speaks of the widest concept that the term presentation can stand for. And he

31:11.720 --> 31:19.720
names this objectivating acts. And this term presentation is given a recent reflection by,

31:20.280 --> 31:27.720
by Gunter Fegall, who is professor of philosophy at Freiburg in his recent book, Objectivity.

31:27.720 --> 31:32.200
And you might want to have a look at his chapter on presentation.

31:36.600 --> 31:44.760
He speaks about single-rate acts in, in this section and many-rate acts. And single-rate acts

31:44.760 --> 31:53.640
are, are things, when I just see one, one item like a chair, but let's say, you know, I've got,

31:54.440 --> 32:02.760
I've got a dozen different things I have to pack in my car. Some squares, some round, some long,

32:03.320 --> 32:14.360
some with, with, with legs that don't unscrew off. And it's a many-rate act that I'm engaging in.

32:15.320 --> 32:25.800
And in terms of ideas, we have lots of dimensions of ideas. The taste of coffee has many dimensions,

32:25.800 --> 32:32.040
and I'm moving in many directions at once, but I'll capture it all under a general term,

32:32.040 --> 32:45.880
like oily seeds or something, or roundness. And there's a tendency then, just for the purpose

32:45.880 --> 32:55.400
of being able to function, for us to turn those many-rate acts into unities, into, into, first

32:55.480 --> 33:03.720
unities retaining the many-rays, but ideally with a single-rate, because the many-rate unities are

33:03.720 --> 33:10.680
very unstable and are difficult to work with interactionally. And so these are turned into

33:10.680 --> 33:19.640
what he calls monothetic acts. In fact, many-rate acts are synthesized and objectivated to help

33:20.600 --> 33:28.760
a, a local cooperative group function successfully. If you look on the bottom of 639,

33:31.080 --> 33:38.520
it is true, but it is true. That's four lines from the bottom on page 369 of investigation,

33:38.520 --> 33:44.520
five of logical investigations. It is true of the conjunctive or better collective synthesis,

33:45.240 --> 33:51.960
as it is true of the predictive synthesis, that it permits a nominalization, in which case the

33:51.960 --> 34:00.520
collective object constituted by the synthesis becomes the simply presented object of a new

34:00.520 --> 34:07.800
single-rate act, and so is made objective in the present sense of the word. So you get all this

34:07.800 --> 34:18.120
work and social work to condense the indexical meanings in a single term that maybe, maybe the

34:18.120 --> 34:25.240
coffee tasters are using. It might still be somewhat indeterminate, but it carries enough

34:25.240 --> 34:36.280
of these many-rate senses that the single term can be used in writing it down on a form

34:36.280 --> 34:45.800
so that it can be passed on to the roaster, so the roaster knows what flavor he's aiming at,

34:45.800 --> 34:51.720
or to the buyer, so he knows what kind of beans to buy. But the question is, and we're going to

34:51.720 --> 35:00.200
see this when we get to the passages in the crisis that Whistle offers us, the does, the

35:00.200 --> 35:05.640
objective form gets passed to the roaster, but does the meanings, do the meanings get passed?

35:05.640 --> 35:11.720
This is the problem of every religion, right? You have these great guys with long beards

35:11.720 --> 35:17.240
having these wonderful insights, and they develop these liturgies and write these books,

35:17.800 --> 35:31.080
Bibles even, commentaries that get transmitted. I mean, we just had Passover last week. I mean,

35:31.080 --> 35:37.480
you have a whole written procedure. You say this, you eat this, you say that, you eat that,

35:37.480 --> 35:44.840
you're supposed to remember slavery, and it's just a social occasion. It's so shallow. It's

35:44.840 --> 35:50.440
embarrassing. Most Passover, most Seder dinners I go to, I'm embarrassed for my own people,

35:50.440 --> 35:56.760
because it's so superficial, because it's such a profound radical revolutionary political experience

35:56.840 --> 36:03.560
in its origin. So how do you get back to that original sense? How do you re-vivify with Durkheim's

36:03.560 --> 36:11.160
term, the form that gets passed down? So we're committed to this. We don't live forever. So we

36:11.160 --> 36:17.800
have to institutionalize our ideas, and we have to simplify the ideas or they won't successfully get

36:17.800 --> 36:23.560
passed down. So we turn these many rays into single rays. We turn these several accounts

36:23.560 --> 36:28.600
into a single summary account, and you go on any tape that you make, and you'll hear the accounts,

36:28.600 --> 36:38.840
and you'll hear a gradually economizing account, so that one terms will stand for everything that

36:38.840 --> 36:43.480
people have thought through and experienced while they're tasting the coffee or whatever they're

36:43.480 --> 36:50.760
doing. And how does that term retain that sense? That's the question that Hussal asked in reference

36:50.760 --> 36:57.720
to geometry in the crisis and in the origin of geometry, and we'll come to that after the break.

37:00.280 --> 37:06.920
So okay, so I mean it's difficult stuff, but it's real stuff. It's real stuff because we're

37:06.920 --> 37:14.760
studying accounts. We're studying how people do that coordination of meaning. But of course,

37:14.760 --> 37:21.480
do itself is a problematic word. Do is a relic of the Enlightenment. It's a relic of the great

37:21.480 --> 37:29.400
age of the rationalist Cartesian subject who's in charge of everything. We're clueless most of the

37:29.400 --> 37:36.360
time. There's no such animal as that. So we're not doing things as things are being done to us. We're

37:36.360 --> 37:45.000
in the midst of these activities, the flux of what some are called reciprocal stimulations

37:45.000 --> 37:50.920
of meanings, or just moving, and we're finding a way to work with them as they're passing us by.

37:50.920 --> 37:59.240
We're not like master builders the way it's easy to write provided you don't have to leave your

37:59.240 --> 38:05.160
study. If you go out and study and find people in the real world, you realize, oh my god,

38:05.160 --> 38:13.080
here's a collection of 35 of the world's best whatever nuclear scientists, astronomers,

38:13.080 --> 38:21.160
and they're not sure what they're doing either, right? I mean it's amazing. So we talk about

38:21.160 --> 38:28.120
doing and we talk about production practices, but there needs to be as much passivity as activity.

38:28.840 --> 38:33.320
And Herschel came to realize this too, but those books have only just been translated

38:33.320 --> 38:42.600
in a new volume, or now not so new, about 10 years ago. Anthony Steinbach translated Herschel's

38:42.600 --> 38:53.720
text on passive synthesis, which I think, I mean Herschel lived 100 years ago without video

38:53.800 --> 39:00.440
recorders. So it's pretty amazing when you come up. Okay, let's move on to ideas.

39:04.520 --> 39:09.960
Ideas is probably a decent place to start. It's a good book to carry with you. If you get a paper

39:09.960 --> 39:16.200
back, it's like one of these books that you don't need to bring many other books. So it's

39:16.200 --> 39:26.360
light to travel with. It's good for backpacking. If you look on 113, this is in section 50

39:28.440 --> 39:38.680
of ideas, the fourth line on page 113, just there's a reference to the German text 94 at the top

39:38.680 --> 39:48.440
right of that page. It should be the next page right after the logical investigations.

39:49.240 --> 40:00.200
Yes.

40:06.680 --> 40:08.440
Well, I'll go and read it. Yes.

40:10.200 --> 40:15.880
Reality is not in itself something absolute, which becomes tied secondarily to something else.

40:16.600 --> 40:19.160
Rather than the absolute sense, it is nothing at all.

40:20.920 --> 40:27.800
It has no absolute essence, whatever. It has the essentiality of something which of necessity

40:27.800 --> 40:33.000
is only intentional. My intention was Brent Thomas term, Brent Thomas being Herschel's teacher.

40:33.880 --> 40:40.760
Only an object of consciousness, something presented in the manner peculiar to consciousness,

40:40.760 --> 40:48.040
something apparent as apparent. So this is a very radical statement. Reality basically

40:48.680 --> 41:02.440
is not what we think it is. If we think that reality is this object after we've erased all of that,

41:03.400 --> 41:13.000
standing in itself, then that doesn't exist. There are trees, but there are trees that are part

41:13.560 --> 41:21.480
of a process in which I am intending, this line is the line of intentionality,

41:22.200 --> 41:32.120
that I persist. In another way of saying that there are no facts, they're only interpretations.

41:34.520 --> 41:38.280
Or all facts are interpreted, that might be another way of saying it.

41:40.840 --> 41:44.760
Why does reality lack self-sufficiency in terms of its essence? Because

41:44.760 --> 41:49.720
its being depends on our understanding. Its essentiality is only intentional,

41:50.680 --> 41:57.480
which means it is only an object of consciousness, like society. Who would argue society exists?

41:58.680 --> 42:07.960
It's not there. It's an ideal notion, or your identity. Who am I? I'm a candlestick maker.

42:09.640 --> 42:16.840
I'm an Indian chief. All these are constructions that don't really exist.

42:17.240 --> 42:24.760
That doesn't mean they have no function. They have a kind of existence.

42:26.760 --> 42:35.720
Now, he refers in 113 to living naively and experiences like really believing

42:36.280 --> 42:43.720
in the independent reality. Like, I really am a movie star. I'm hot, can't you tell?

42:44.680 --> 42:51.880
And so you have Judy Garland committing suicide, because it turns out she was not so hot.

42:53.720 --> 42:57.800
As when her fault, the world led her to believe she was that hot. She was too young

42:57.800 --> 43:00.920
to work it out. It happens to a lot of childhood actors.

43:01.640 --> 43:14.920
So if you realize this lack of independent, that this reality is not the truth of our being,

43:16.360 --> 43:24.120
there'll be some measure of safety, maybe. But you still need to use these things.

43:24.120 --> 43:29.080
I mean, there's a sense in which this coffee does have a round flavor, or have woody flavor.

43:29.880 --> 43:35.720
But the woodyness is your invention. It's not the coffee itself. And so you need to

43:35.720 --> 43:43.480
proceed. You need to learn how to proceed with those objectivated notions that help you understand

43:43.480 --> 43:50.360
the coffee better, but you can't be limited by your use of those objectivated notions.

43:50.360 --> 43:54.040
So how do you use those notions? How do you use those objectivities?

43:54.680 --> 44:02.760
In a wise way would be a way I would say. And so he develops a phenomenological reduction,

44:02.760 --> 44:08.040
this practice of putting out of action our positings. And if you look on 114,

44:13.720 --> 44:20.200
in the middle of the page, after the IE, just above the 95,

44:20.920 --> 44:24.840
reference to the German edition, page 114 of the English,

44:26.120 --> 44:34.360
we parenthesize the positings affected. For our new inquiries, we do not participate in these

44:34.360 --> 44:45.000
positings. Instead of living in them, instead of affecting them, we affect acts of reflection

44:45.720 --> 44:53.640
directed to them. So instead of living in them, instead of taking them seriously,

44:53.640 --> 45:01.560
instead of believing your propaganda, you look at how they got to be what they were. And that

45:01.560 --> 45:09.640
will open you up to the whole historicality of how they got to be made. And it will open you up,

45:09.640 --> 45:18.680
hopefully you can go back far enough to find how they got to be made and get the horizon of

45:18.680 --> 45:24.840
original experience that you had at that moment. It's like if you're following a map and you get

45:24.840 --> 45:32.920
lost and the map, the unity of sense of the map falls asunder because it doesn't, the place you

45:32.920 --> 45:39.560
found doesn't correspond with how you interpreted the dots on the map. You go back to the

45:39.560 --> 45:44.920
point where you were really sure, where you really had the map in hand, and then you start out again,

45:44.920 --> 45:52.680
because you can't just capture the meaning of the map at that point. You need to capture the

45:53.320 --> 45:59.960
horizon of meaning, this futural anticipation of what's coming next. You have to go back and capture

45:59.960 --> 46:06.360
it at a point where you knew where it was. So it's kind of like archaeology, I suppose,

46:06.600 --> 46:15.320
archaeology of consciousness. I think Foucault already did that, but anyway. So by positing,

46:15.320 --> 46:23.560
he's merely talking about this arrow. But what we're talking about here is there's an arrow in

46:23.560 --> 46:35.160
which, it's really the arrows going in both directions. You have the landscape is transformed

46:35.160 --> 46:43.960
by the way we posit it, and that landscape feeds back to us and gives us a new perspective from

46:43.960 --> 46:54.680
which to posit further. So there's a circular, I suppose, process of understanding. In any case,

46:54.680 --> 47:00.760
what's interesting for us is not just how this happens with one person, but how people together

47:00.760 --> 47:08.920
do this. But in both cases, we keep our minds trained on what he's calling here a sense bestowing

47:08.920 --> 47:17.160
consciousness. And so the first definition of phenomenology would be the study of

47:18.920 --> 47:27.720
sense bestowing consciousness, or he says in the last line of this section 50 in the middle of the

47:27.720 --> 47:34.920
page on page 114, the infinite field of absolute mental processes, the fundamental field of

47:34.920 --> 47:40.920
phenomenology. Now that fundamental field of phenomenology is italics. It makes you even more

47:40.920 --> 47:46.440
determined to figure out what on earth is he talking about by infinite and absolute. I mean,

47:46.440 --> 47:54.200
it's not apparent. Absolute here simply means strictly. It's like just looking at the thinking

47:54.200 --> 48:03.400
part by itself. Sometimes he uses the word pure. Just looking at what is the mind doing,

48:04.840 --> 48:09.640
regardless of what's really out there. I mean, even if you're hallucinating,

48:09.640 --> 48:15.480
is there an hallucination? Let's capture if it's really happening in your mind, then it's real enough

48:15.480 --> 48:23.720
for us to capture. So that's the absolute mental processes and infinite because there's so much

48:24.040 --> 48:30.840
we don't have enough paper to write the field notes for all of that the people are doing. So we

48:30.840 --> 48:37.400
have to be selective. And of course, Garfield's advice is select those aspects that are most

48:37.400 --> 48:44.600
identifying of the work they're doing. Anyway, the second definition of phenomenology is it's the

48:44.600 --> 48:52.120
study of the imminent structures of consciousness, right? That is the stuff that's going on.

48:52.840 --> 48:57.800
Imminent means really close up. There's two words in English. I don't know how it comes out in

48:57.800 --> 49:08.120
Danish, but imminent and imminent, imminent is spatial and imminent is temporal. And we're talking

49:08.120 --> 49:16.360
about the spatial. Heidegger's phrase was proximally and for the most part. That means

49:16.360 --> 49:24.920
proximally means really in your face. Okay, let's move on to 55.

49:32.760 --> 49:39.560
And he says in the second line in italics, all real unities are unities of sense.

49:40.280 --> 49:47.160
That is, society isn't real. My identity isn't real. Well, it is real, but that

49:47.160 --> 49:53.000
real unity is a unity of sense. That is, it's related to the sense bestowing consciousness.

49:54.040 --> 50:05.240
He says, you see on line two and three of 129, the phrase sense bestowing consciousness. And then

50:05.240 --> 50:12.520
a few lines down in the italics again, he says in absolute line eight, maybe nine,

50:13.080 --> 50:23.160
an absolute reality is just as valid as around square. Reality and world are names here precisely

50:23.160 --> 50:32.760
for certain valid unities of sense. And he doesn't hear mean any subjectivism. These things are

50:32.760 --> 50:39.960
really happening. You really do think these things. So there's no subjectivism involved.

50:39.960 --> 50:50.520
There's no real idealism involved. In Garfinkel's book, the seeing sociologically that was based on

50:50.520 --> 50:59.400
his dissertation, he talks about the sterilities of subjectivism. He was very clear at the outset,

50:59.400 --> 51:06.600
he's not into subjectivism, which is why he got a little upset when everybody first reviewed

51:06.600 --> 51:11.960
ethnomathology as being subjectivist, because he was opposed to that from the get go.

51:13.320 --> 51:19.720
That is, the phenomenological reduction excludes the naive natural attitude that believes its own

51:19.720 --> 51:26.680
propaganda. So it's just rejecting the bullshit. I mean, it's not like that qualifies one for

51:26.680 --> 51:31.080
being objective, just because you don't believe all the positive is propaganda doesn't make you

51:31.080 --> 51:38.360
a subjectivist. That is, if facts are really interpreted facts, then thinking that their

51:38.360 --> 51:46.600
facts all by themselves is to be biased. Even though it sounds like bias belongs with that

51:46.600 --> 51:54.200
word interpretation, but the interpretation is really going on, then that's not subjective.

51:54.280 --> 52:01.880
It's not idealism. Excluding the natural attitude means that we do not dream the

52:01.880 --> 52:10.360
objectivations are severed from consciousness, or from the imminent, if we're going to talk more

52:10.360 --> 52:18.840
like ethnomathologists, those objectivations, those accounts, those formulations, those organizing

52:18.840 --> 52:28.200
ideas are never separated from the imminent, interactional processes that generate those local

52:28.200 --> 52:44.760
structures. Okay, so let's go on to 87. The, uh, yeah, it's a couple pages later. Oh, it's page

52:44.840 --> 52:53.640
211, but since it's, it says chapter three, now why, this is another, this is ideas, chapter three.

53:01.400 --> 53:07.640
He talks here about, he's critical of one may have, it's towards seven lines, eight lines on the

53:07.640 --> 53:12.760
bottom, one may of course use the word phenomenology, but one does not have the matter itself. He's

53:12.760 --> 53:18.040
already upset midway in his career that people are saying phenomenology, this and phenomenology,

53:18.040 --> 53:24.040
that, and don't have a clue what it is. Just as Harold was really upset about people talking about

53:24.040 --> 53:30.760
ethnomathology, this and ethnomathology, that, and he wanted to stop using the word. He didn't

53:30.760 --> 53:36.600
want to talk about it, the methodology, he wanted to engage in actual studies instead of talking

53:36.600 --> 53:44.600
about engaging in actual studies. Uh, so the rigor is necessary, uh, if you don't have phenomenology

53:44.600 --> 53:54.840
unless, unless you get to a kind of very austere analysis in which you're tough nose about not

53:54.840 --> 54:03.000
accepting anything theoretical. He's not trying to be theoretical. It's more like the, the observations

54:03.000 --> 54:08.920
of bird watchers. You know, he's, he's just not watching birds building nests. He's watching

54:08.920 --> 54:22.280
human beings thinking. Uh, he says on the next page to 12, um, I'm not sure where, but, but he,

54:22.280 --> 54:30.120
he talks about it, uh, unin, people, unencumbered, I mean, he talked about himself, unencumbered by

54:30.200 --> 54:38.360
all current and learned theories, sort of satirizing, learned theories. We don't want a, a theory, uh,

54:40.920 --> 54:47.400
um, he, you know, he says about, I don't know, a third the way up from the bottom. Rather than

54:47.400 --> 54:52.280
living in the perception, adverted to the perceived and considering and theorizing,

54:52.280 --> 54:57.320
they do not matter to direct the regard instead to the perceiving. That is, he wants,

54:58.120 --> 55:05.000
he wants to not be distracted. He finds theorizing a distraction. So there's even, I would say,

55:05.720 --> 55:12.520
a fraternity here with the ideological aspects of those phenomenologists

55:13.960 --> 55:21.640
who tell me at any rate that they don't read Husserl because they think theory is a distraction

55:21.640 --> 55:25.800
and Husserl is a theorist, so they don't read Husserl. And if they were to read Husserl, they

55:25.800 --> 55:32.920
would get the advice from them that they shouldn't be theorizing things. Okay. Uh, and I think it's,

55:32.920 --> 55:38.840
it sounded vice. And it doesn't mean that we can't over theorize with phenomenology. We just have to

55:38.840 --> 55:47.880
be really disciplined and not do it. That's where the rigor is. Um, in, in the next section 102,

55:48.840 --> 55:56.840
uh, it also covers objectivation. It discusses the nomadic object that is the object that functions

55:56.840 --> 56:07.880
as a sign, a designation, a unity in the mental process. You see objectivation in italics on

56:08.360 --> 56:17.880
249 and Garfinkel picks up that term, uh, and uses it from 1950 onwards. Um,

56:21.640 --> 56:30.680
the, uh, it's this objectivation that is a nomadic core in Husserl's language that's, that's,

56:31.640 --> 56:39.960
it's used by people to coordinate their thinking, to hold, remember I said, to preserve and present

56:40.760 --> 56:45.880
the object that they found using that way of looking at it, to preserve it so that they

56:45.880 --> 56:55.400
continue to experience it in that way. That nomadic core allows that not only allows us to

56:55.400 --> 57:02.520
have that experience, but it allows us to share that experience, provided that we give a name to

57:02.520 --> 57:09.640
it and indicate what's something about what's to be done with that name. So it's what allows a group

57:09.640 --> 57:19.960
to proceed as a collective body. Okay. There's a very interesting passage in, in section 121,

57:20.760 --> 57:26.440
uh, which is a couple of pages later, um,

57:34.920 --> 57:44.920
that reveals that Husserl had an active scope, uh, of social phenomena, uh, in sight. Um, and I,

57:44.920 --> 57:53.880
I'll read the passage to you on page 289, uh, under section 121. Um, and then we'll talk about

57:55.400 --> 58:05.000
that's line five on 289. For example, the mother who looks lovingly upon her flock of children

58:05.320 --> 58:15.400
embraces each child singly and altogether in one act of love. The unity of the collective

58:15.400 --> 58:21.000
act of loving is not a loving and in addition, the collective objectivating, even if it is

58:21.000 --> 58:28.120
attached to the loving as it's necessary foundation, loving instead is itself collective.

58:29.240 --> 58:34.600
Now that's a very curious passage because it's an incredibly social kind of analysis.

58:34.600 --> 58:41.400
It's one of those relatively few occasions in which Husserl specifically is examining a

58:41.400 --> 58:49.880
collective activity rather than an activity of individual consciousness. And, and it shows that,

58:49.880 --> 58:56.840
that, that he, it's not that he's completely ignorant of the social, uh, although given the

58:56.840 --> 59:03.240
prejudice of his time, he always goes back to the classical philosophical Cartesian

59:04.440 --> 59:12.200
individual consciousness, uh, which I think is a flaw, but, but he's fully aware. And I think to

59:12.200 --> 59:19.880
some extent, uh, that motivated his interest in simile and simile taught him even more, uh, about

59:20.520 --> 59:28.680
this interest, um, that this idea of collective objectivating, which I think I put up here,

59:30.520 --> 59:37.960
is, uh, is, I think, I think the story, it's not, he finds this interesting, uh,

59:39.160 --> 59:45.320
it's not something added on, it's like something foundational. So that's interesting. But

59:46.200 --> 59:51.560
it's not foundational enough so that when Husserl, or when Husserlian philosophers

59:51.560 --> 59:59.800
start doing their, their, uh, their formal phenomenological analyses that they provide

01:00:00.760 --> 01:00:09.560
such an originary reading of the collective, uh, objectivation when they, when they analyze,

01:00:09.560 --> 01:00:13.880
I mean, they basically reduce everything to the individual. I've had these arguments for years

01:00:13.880 --> 01:00:20.440
in the phenomenology meetings, uh, that, that is its collective character is primordial.

01:00:21.880 --> 01:00:28.680
People don't know what they're doing ahead of time and then negotiate meetings like,

01:00:29.240 --> 01:00:35.800
like the social contract. That's mythology. Garfinkel would say that's a just so story.

01:00:36.360 --> 01:00:41.240
Doesn't happen that way. They, people, and Heinegger already understands it and that's,

01:00:41.240 --> 01:00:47.240
that's why Garfinkel read Heinegger. That's what got him excited because this phrase you get in

01:00:47.240 --> 01:00:57.480
Heinegger, it's always already known. That always already implies that, that people don't start with

01:00:57.480 --> 01:01:04.600
entabular rasa and then add it up due to some kind of phenomenological process of synthesizing

01:01:04.600 --> 01:01:10.200
meanings and get to a deductive conclusion. Rather, Heinegger's talking about the always already

01:01:10.760 --> 01:01:16.680
rethrown into the world, not of our own making with the solution in our hands and only at that

01:01:16.680 --> 01:01:23.800
point do we start to make sense of what it is I've got. And that's, at that point, that's when

01:01:23.800 --> 01:01:28.680
Garfinkel wants to be there. How does that sense making happen? How do we, how, what are those

01:01:28.680 --> 01:01:36.600
achieve coherences? Right? I mean, it's, it's incredibly radical and, you know, uh, I remember

01:01:36.680 --> 01:01:42.840
as a hobby saying, no, it's arguing with him about, about the originality of collectivity and no,

01:01:42.840 --> 01:01:47.560
all that's in hustle. All you got to read more carefully. You got to read more carefully. And

01:01:47.560 --> 01:01:55.880
he's right. But, but there's even more, I think, it's even more important than I think he appreciates.

01:01:55.880 --> 01:02:03.240
Anyway, then he talks in this page, he goes on to talk about an emotional objectivity. Okay,

01:02:03.240 --> 01:02:09.560
once you, once you start talking about an emotional objectivity, I can tell you all the

01:02:09.560 --> 01:02:15.880
scientists in my university are going to check out, right? They punch their exit card on, on

01:02:15.880 --> 01:02:24.840
emotional objectivity, right? But there are these, like, let's say there's a Bruce Springsteen song,

01:02:24.840 --> 01:02:31.640
or just every Bruce Springsteen concert, for being sake, is an emotional objectivation, right?

01:02:31.640 --> 01:02:36.360
I mean, wow. And it's a different experience because of its collective character. And if you

01:02:36.360 --> 01:02:41.000
don't know anything about Bruce Springsteen and you come into it that way, it's only a collective

01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:51.000
phenomenon and not an individual one. Uh, I mean, and you can hear really well that way. And so it,

01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:59.480
if it's really going on, it's not subjectivist, it is objective. But then the question is,

01:02:59.480 --> 01:03:04.680
and now we want to ask this question in the most radical way possible, how is it objective?

01:03:05.480 --> 01:03:10.040
That is, how can this example shed light upon what it is to be objective?

01:03:13.560 --> 01:03:19.880
It's, how does this emotion that gets objectivated as an object in the way of everyone to share

01:03:19.880 --> 01:03:28.280
and to use for harmonizing their actions? It's, he speaks of the unity of a collective liking.

01:03:28.280 --> 01:03:34.920
I mean, there's a lot going on. It's, I don't know anyone who's really commented much on this

01:03:34.920 --> 01:03:42.120
passage. It's sort of buried deep in ideas. And, and not, he, I don't think he comes back to it.

01:03:42.120 --> 01:03:49.080
My problem is, I don't read German. And there's more stuff that's in Husso's library in Belgium

01:03:49.720 --> 01:03:57.720
than, than there is, this has been translated, right? I mean, so I can't really be a bonafide

01:03:57.720 --> 01:04:01.800
Husso and scholar, but I don't read German, right? So everybody said, why haven't you read German?

01:04:01.800 --> 01:04:10.040
I had my hands full, you know? I mean, anyway, and I don't have enough years to do that. But who knows?

01:04:11.080 --> 01:04:16.600
Okay, move on to my favorite book, Formal and Transcendental Logic, and then we'll take a break

01:04:16.600 --> 01:04:25.480
after, after we do this. Isn't it? Oh yeah, that's number two. That is, well, 16 and 17,

01:04:25.480 --> 01:04:32.440
what, 116 and 170? That's just number two readings. We send it in two packages. Oh, did we? Okay.

01:04:35.800 --> 01:04:41.080
Subsection F, the Categorial Formations. Every time I type Categorial,

01:04:41.080 --> 01:04:48.360
Microsoft Word wants to do a spell check. They'll change it for me,

01:04:49.240 --> 01:04:52.280
no. I mean, I like to turn everything they do off.

01:04:55.320 --> 01:05:01.720
Habitual and intersubjective possessions, okay. Okay, here again, in this passage,

01:05:01.720 --> 01:05:06.040
and I select it for that reason, from Formal Transcendental Logic, I should add,

01:05:06.600 --> 01:05:12.360
I think it's Herschel's best book because more than any other book, he wrote it from beginning

01:05:12.360 --> 01:05:20.360
to end as one coherent piece. All logical investigations, ideas are kind of like,

01:05:21.400 --> 01:05:29.000
like Viconstinian notebooks, right, with, with topics that have organization for a large

01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:40.280
range of pages, but the whole book isn't one particular piece. The, in fact, a lot of his work

01:05:40.280 --> 01:05:49.400
now are his unpublished works. And then you never know how much the editor's doing, you know,

01:05:49.400 --> 01:06:00.600
whether the editor's long grab, or many others. But here, this was his piece, and I think it's

01:06:00.600 --> 01:06:06.120
a good one to read if you want to get into the real or so. Anyway, here in this passage, he talks

01:06:06.120 --> 01:06:16.200
about a community of judges again, and judges in the plural, and of Categorial Objectivities

01:06:16.200 --> 01:06:25.400
as constituted in the judgment community. So that's certainly a social phenomenon. We can talk about

01:06:25.400 --> 01:06:32.040
a lot of things, but in the interest of time, I'm just going to stick with the most relevant.

01:06:33.720 --> 01:06:38.920
And I find those in G, the objectivity given beforehand,

01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:48.040
he identifies two kinds of objectivity here. He identifies the objectivity given beforehand,

01:06:48.840 --> 01:06:54.120
and he contrasts that with the Categorial Objectivity produced by thinking.

01:06:56.120 --> 01:07:02.520
So the category, the objectivity beforehand is like received ideas, like,

01:07:03.320 --> 01:07:13.320
I don't know, I suppose, a prayer book for a particular ceremony, or a prayer,

01:07:14.120 --> 01:07:21.800
or something that's handed down that everybody knows something about, and it's given beforehand.

01:07:21.800 --> 01:07:27.400
But then there are those things that you yourself produce. He says the one given beforehand is the

01:07:27.400 --> 01:07:35.160
pooled experience of a community that is on line six. And there's some very interesting

01:07:35.160 --> 01:07:44.360
things about this discussion, but the social aspect should be clear. The sense of what's

01:07:44.360 --> 01:07:52.200
handed down is really only evident when it's embodied in actual affairs, and he calls that

01:07:52.200 --> 01:08:00.680
meaning fulfillment, or sense fulfillment, that you get this thing that's handed down,

01:08:01.720 --> 01:08:08.680
and then this objectivity handed down, and then you get, you have to, well,

01:08:08.680 --> 01:08:14.440
Durkheim's term was vivify, but they were writing at the same time, I suppose they read each other,

01:08:15.400 --> 01:08:25.640
but he's talking about the, you have to make it come alive again in this sense fulfillment.

01:08:31.800 --> 01:08:38.280
But, I mean, even though there's this division between these long-standing, maybe,

01:08:39.000 --> 01:08:44.440
you know, they can be a thousand years, two thousand years, objectivities that get passed down

01:08:45.000 --> 01:08:52.520
from generation, from one congregation to the next, but you still, they're still

01:08:52.520 --> 01:08:59.160
categorically formed. I mean, categorical objectivity is categorical, obviously, because you're

01:08:59.160 --> 01:09:12.520
making it and you're synthesizing a sense for it, but the, my mind's going 12 places,

01:09:14.920 --> 01:09:20.520
they're both involved, categorical formations. There's no way that you can, there's no objectivity

01:09:20.520 --> 01:09:28.360
that stands on its own. You always have to develop its horizon of sense and application,

01:09:28.440 --> 01:09:33.800
but there is a distinction in terms of the pedigree of an objectivity and something

01:09:33.800 --> 01:09:39.000
that's brand new. There are, like in the coffee business, there are forms that people use,

01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:47.400
and there are respected forms that have been used for decades in thousands of international

01:09:47.400 --> 01:09:54.600
top prize coffee tasting, and that has, you respect that form, or there are forms that you develop

01:09:54.600 --> 01:10:00.200
just because you're not happy with that form for the, for the coffees that you have to,

01:10:00.200 --> 01:10:05.240
maybe you're in Italy and the form's based on infusion, and you're doing espressos,

01:10:05.240 --> 01:10:13.160
and you need a different form. The form that I saw at BKI coffee in Arroz two days ago,

01:10:14.280 --> 01:10:21.160
it's a really fascinating form because it's briefer than most forms, and it's less

01:10:21.160 --> 01:10:28.760
quantitative, though there are some quantitative indications on it, but they would be lost

01:10:28.760 --> 01:10:36.920
without that form. They, they would be really, it allows them to make sure they remember to

01:10:36.920 --> 01:10:45.480
look at all these aspects of the flavor, and, and it's oriented toward their practical needs

01:10:45.480 --> 01:10:55.480
of finding defects and, and of making sure that the coffees they're buying are good enough for

01:10:55.480 --> 01:11:03.640
the blends that they're, their intent on making, and, but then they can fill in the form, and they

01:11:03.640 --> 01:11:09.400
then pass on the form to other people, and then they have to understand what that form means.

01:11:10.360 --> 01:11:18.200
So what, the question again is what is objectivity? If you, you give it a number, the Italians are

01:11:18.200 --> 01:11:29.320
very precise, it's an 80.5 just above the level you need to be certified, right? So it's objective,

01:11:29.400 --> 01:11:40.760
right? But, you know, bless their souls, they know that, that it's not that objective, it's very

01:11:40.760 --> 01:11:48.280
objective, but what is objective? And there's some odd things going on in that, you know, the coffee

01:11:48.280 --> 01:11:58.120
was roasted a week ago, two weeks ago, so it's not going to have the flavor, if I'm going to judge it

01:11:58.120 --> 01:12:07.320
fairly, maybe if it only gets a 79.5, it should qualify, you know. You have to use some wisdom

01:12:07.320 --> 01:12:14.840
and, and judgment. Anyway, what I'm saying is that, is that the, the category of operations,

01:12:14.840 --> 01:12:22.120
the, the need to resituate each form, I mean, I'm trying to get at what is objectivity.

01:12:23.000 --> 01:12:29.480
Hustl's question is how do we make our experiencing itself and its productions a theme of judgment?

01:12:29.480 --> 01:12:35.800
You're looking, you're not taking it for granted, you're not accepting the propaganda, oh it's 80.5,

01:12:35.800 --> 01:12:43.080
it's on the best form by the best teachers, it's fact. You're looking at the process of judgment,

01:12:43.080 --> 01:12:48.600
you're looking at the synthetic activities, the category of activities of a judgment community.

01:12:48.920 --> 01:12:55.800
Now, Hustl uses a very important research strategy, and he talks about this on 119.

01:12:56.360 --> 01:13:05.160
He says, on the, on the very top of 119, if we go on synthetically to make our experiencing itself

01:13:05.160 --> 01:13:10.360
and its productions a theme of judgment, only then can we have original knowledge of the fact

01:13:10.360 --> 01:13:17.000
that this harmoniously flowing experiencing already bears implicitly in itself before our thinking,

01:13:17.000 --> 01:13:21.080
before our thinking, and the category of formations produced by our thinking, the

01:13:21.080 --> 01:13:27.320
being sense of nature, as the same sense that thinking explicates, and he says,

01:13:27.320 --> 01:13:34.920
all this too is anything but a piece of argumentative idealism. He doesn't want just

01:13:36.520 --> 01:13:41.960
theory, it is obtained not from any speculating epistemology, right, he gets accused of being

01:13:41.960 --> 01:13:49.080
epistemologist, or standpoint philosophy, that's static philosophy, that's the philosophy of

01:13:49.080 --> 01:13:56.600
positivists, but from plain sense investigation and discovery. I mean, can you see how

01:13:57.240 --> 01:14:02.760
this statement here is sympathetic with the motivating statement of ethnomethodology,

01:14:03.640 --> 01:14:11.240
not standpoint philosophy, but plain sense investigation and discovery. So he wants to

01:14:11.240 --> 01:14:17.480
go to the things themselves, and there's remarkable continuity between ideas and formal and transcendental

01:14:17.480 --> 01:14:25.880
logic. So our studies are studies of sense investigation, but our studies also many times

01:14:25.880 --> 01:14:32.440
have been too conceptual. And we need to pay, we need to learn how to pay more attention to the

01:14:32.440 --> 01:14:39.320
eight conceptual phenomena by which the world gains its coherency. I know that's a theoretical

01:14:39.320 --> 01:14:46.680
observation, but how do I not reduce everything, all coherencies, to the conceptual? I mean,

01:14:46.760 --> 01:14:57.080
we need to find research domains which are tough to turn into concepts. And it's hard to study

01:14:57.080 --> 01:15:03.400
that because these eight conceptual coherencies are invisible. I mean, it's hard to know, I'm

01:15:03.400 --> 01:15:10.760
studying these surfers, and you know, I can't know for sure, three times out of four, and I'm a surfer,

01:15:11.320 --> 01:15:18.840
and they're all taken for granted, right? I mean, Garfinkle says that in many places.

01:15:19.960 --> 01:15:30.360
And so they kind of like slip in under one's gaze as a sort of of course phenomenon. So to turn

01:15:30.360 --> 01:15:38.280
those into perspicuous cases is the task. And that's why, you know, Garfinkle went to the inverting

01:15:38.280 --> 01:15:45.640
lenses and the pedestrian crossings and the freeway traffic, things like that. So here's another

01:15:45.640 --> 01:15:51.160
definition for ethnomethology. We're studying the taken for granted coherencies that provide the

01:15:51.160 --> 01:16:01.080
foundation of ordinary sense. The taken for granted, you know, these Gestalt coherencies

01:16:01.960 --> 01:16:12.520
to use Barrett's face. Okay, should we, yeah, let's just finish the pharmacotranscendental

01:16:12.520 --> 01:16:26.360
logic and then we'll come back and do the crisis. On the next section on 125, I think that's Greek

01:16:26.360 --> 01:16:34.920
C, that looks like a Y, the scientist attitude. We have more discussion of

01:16:34.920 --> 01:16:43.320
categorical objectivities, and they don't exist before our thinking. And yet, as soon as we think

01:16:43.320 --> 01:16:50.760
them, they seem to be existing by themselves just as soon as we come up with them. I mean,

01:16:51.640 --> 01:17:02.920
just as soon as gets a hope, we would say just as soon as they clean up the data and they find the

01:17:02.920 --> 01:17:08.840
star, the star is all there by itself, right? It's no longer dependent on the data. I mean,

01:17:08.840 --> 01:17:17.720
it just happens instantly. So in what sense, if Husserl is right, if Husserl

01:17:21.800 --> 01:17:32.520
is correct about them being always categorically formed, always synthesized, then in what sense

01:17:32.600 --> 01:17:39.000
can they be objective? Can they be objective? What do we mean by objective if they are partly

01:17:39.000 --> 01:17:45.880
our production? Well, to some sense, there's a tangibility to that objective. A tangibility

01:17:45.880 --> 01:17:56.840
as an object, as in taste descriptors, you know, have a tangibility to them. The Noema,

01:17:57.720 --> 01:18:04.440
what allows them to retain the idea is that they have this objectivity to them. They have this

01:18:04.440 --> 01:18:13.240
tangibility to them. The intention aimed at cognition passes clear through these Noema. He

01:18:13.240 --> 01:18:20.520
tells us on 125. You can't think without them. And they're even more important in social affairs.

01:18:20.520 --> 01:18:25.400
They're not just important for our own thinking the way classical phenomenology would think it,

01:18:25.400 --> 01:18:33.400
but they're important in social affairs. And in fact, but there's an added problem. Once a

01:18:33.400 --> 01:18:41.880
categorical objectivity is given a name and that nominal form is appreciated and confirmed by

01:18:41.880 --> 01:18:50.200
everybody, it all of a sudden gains a moral value. And that moral value tweaks everything.

01:18:50.200 --> 01:18:56.200
And really, it's hard to see clearly after the expectation that this is the truth

01:18:57.880 --> 01:19:06.200
starts being laid upon us. But that's a separate topic. He actually does talk a little about that,

01:19:06.200 --> 01:19:13.880
but we're not going. But he says on this page, these conditional acquisitions are abiding

01:19:13.880 --> 01:19:19.960
and accessible to everyone. Okay, that's the important thing. And he says every scientific

01:19:19.960 --> 01:19:25.240
statement has this sense from the start. It's already addressed to this everyone.

01:19:28.360 --> 01:19:33.000
So this is social and expresses Herschel's interest in communication as well.

01:19:34.520 --> 01:19:39.880
I think Herschel is implying that the process of constructing these ideal objectivities

01:19:39.880 --> 01:19:49.720
is the same for the scientist as it is for the everyday judge, as he calls it. But that leads

01:19:49.720 --> 01:19:54.360
us to the question is, so what then is the difference between scientific objectivity

01:19:54.360 --> 01:20:01.960
and objectivity for the everyday judges? He answers that by saying that the difference is that the

01:20:01.960 --> 01:20:10.200
scientist is more inclined, more habituated in his terms, to reexamining his or her objectivities

01:20:11.080 --> 01:20:20.360
than our ordinary persons who are less likely to question themselves and less likely to reexamine

01:20:20.360 --> 01:20:26.760
things. If you look at the bottom of 124, four lines from the bottom, not that the scientist

01:20:26.760 --> 01:20:33.240
does not judge at all before having such a having of the affairs themselves, the objectivities

01:20:33.240 --> 01:20:38.840
themselves that belong to this particular category level. But he takes all prior judgments as only

01:20:38.840 --> 01:20:45.400
provisional. The categorical objectivities accepted in them as only provisionally accepted

01:20:45.400 --> 01:20:51.480
as merely supposed objectivities. So there's a willingness to surrender

01:20:51.800 --> 01:21:00.280
what's become habitual among scientists, a greater willingness to surrender your affiliation

01:21:00.840 --> 01:21:06.280
compared with people in everyday life. Now Schultz added another one in his writings

01:21:06.280 --> 01:21:12.120
in terms of the difference between common sense thinkers and scientific thinkers. He says that

01:21:12.120 --> 01:21:19.320
the scientists systematically expose their thinking to criticism of other people. That's not

01:21:19.320 --> 01:21:24.440
that they're thinking any differently. I mean he agrees with Schultz to that extent that they're

01:21:24.440 --> 01:21:31.800
using the same processes but they're more open to this kind of negative criticism and that's

01:21:31.800 --> 01:21:37.720
part of the process. You know what they say isn't true but you have peer review and you have a

01:21:37.720 --> 01:21:42.840
consensus and debate and dialectics and at the end of that you have something you don't have in

01:21:42.840 --> 01:21:49.160
everyday life. But the structuring of the prejudgements is similar. You might try to

01:21:49.160 --> 01:21:57.080
employ this taking as only provisional, this endless suspicion of yourself as a constant practice.

01:21:59.880 --> 01:22:05.800
And if you do, it's for sure you won't be invited to the parties that they have at the

01:22:05.800 --> 01:22:13.000
university. You know those sociologists. I mean we're constantly questioning authority. We have

01:22:13.000 --> 01:22:19.800
a bumper sticker in Eugene, question authority. Everybody likes to put that in their car, question

01:22:19.800 --> 01:22:27.240
authority. But the people who put that in their car are questioning other people's authority.

01:22:27.240 --> 01:22:33.720
Schultz was talking about questioning your own authority. That's really more helpful.

01:22:34.040 --> 01:22:39.480
And that's the good coffee. That's why I love the coffee thing. They do that a lot because they have

01:22:39.480 --> 01:22:47.720
to do that because their cards, their descriptors are hemming them in at every stage while every cup

01:22:47.720 --> 01:22:54.520
of coffee they taste is breaking them out causing them to move through them and transcend them.

01:22:55.320 --> 01:23:04.600
So the crisis in science that Husserl speaks of is when scientists fail to live up to this constant

01:23:04.600 --> 01:23:13.160
self-criticism or what Husserl calls in this text radical self-understanding. Radical self-understanding

01:23:14.360 --> 01:23:21.640
it's a great notion and I think even a great term. Radical self-understanding

01:23:22.200 --> 01:23:32.040
is understanding that is bifocal. It's looking at the object and trying to nail down you know

01:23:33.000 --> 01:23:41.000
what geological formation is. But as it's doing, as Hoppe demonstrated to us the

01:23:41.000 --> 01:23:50.760
astronomers have to do as part of their trade, you have to look at yourself looking.

01:23:50.760 --> 01:23:57.080
You have to have this reflexive gaze. You have to see yourself seeing. Radical self-understanding

01:23:57.080 --> 01:24:02.360
is understanding that it's understanding while it's always re-examining its roots.

01:24:03.480 --> 01:24:08.840
So you're constantly in Husserlian terms which is very criticized by the postmodernist

01:24:08.840 --> 01:24:15.960
purifying your consciousness meaning that you're you're fessing up to your biases. You're realizing

01:24:15.960 --> 01:24:24.040
that this coffee is round because you're using the term round. So you're trying to constantly

01:24:25.720 --> 01:24:33.720
check up on yourself to make sure that you're not eating yourself down a rosy trail.

01:24:36.120 --> 01:24:42.760
And then he says this is a peculiar judging procedure in 125. He's right in the middle of

01:24:42.760 --> 01:24:49.800
the page in 125. This brings about a peculiar judging procedure on the scientist part in italics.

01:24:49.800 --> 01:24:56.760
A zigzag judging. Okay that is that is you're going to the object and then you're going to the

01:24:56.760 --> 01:25:00.920
mind and then you're going back to the object and you're going to the mind. First making

01:25:00.920 --> 01:25:05.880
straight for the giveness of something itself but then going back critically to the provisional

01:25:05.880 --> 01:25:14.520
results already obtained whereupon his criticism must also be subjected to criticism. So it's almost

01:25:14.520 --> 01:25:25.000
an endless criticism of the critique of of the acceptance and you know that is an endless

01:25:25.000 --> 01:25:30.440
regress and how you go at the end of his life wrote some very cogent articles on that but

01:25:30.520 --> 01:25:38.600
but you have to you have to do that we can't do any better that's that's the cards that have been

01:25:38.600 --> 01:25:49.080
given to us. Note also on this page Heschel's profound realization of the limits of science.

01:25:49.080 --> 01:25:56.840
He says at the end of that same paragraph in parentheses when he talks about true getting

01:25:56.840 --> 01:26:03.320
the true being he says an idea incidentally the sense and limits of which are not matters for

01:26:03.320 --> 01:26:15.080
positive science itself to explore that is the the whole process of this criticism and radical

01:26:15.080 --> 01:26:24.840
self-understanding positive science hasn't really appreciated and maybe it's not even in its in its

01:26:25.480 --> 01:26:34.280
bag of responsibilities although it should be the crisis is that they don't so he he defines

01:26:37.800 --> 01:26:43.880
science as cognizing that accepts no judgments as scientific except those that have shown their

01:26:43.880 --> 01:26:51.720
correctness and that's that's I think a very important thing where does truth originate

01:26:52.280 --> 01:27:02.200
does it originate in method or does it originate in what Heschel called evidence in German which

01:27:02.200 --> 01:27:08.920
means immediate insight in this correctness that he puts in quotes because it's hard to put a word

01:27:09.960 --> 01:27:15.640
but I know something is true because I have that experience I taste that roundness and that roundness

01:27:15.640 --> 01:27:22.680
is so true that that's where I start that's that and if anybody says something else I'll deny

01:27:22.680 --> 01:27:27.720
you know I mean like my experience in my life is there's no such thing as reincarnation

01:27:29.560 --> 01:27:34.360
and so I'm living with all these people who presume I believe in it and I and I get into a lot

01:27:34.360 --> 01:27:41.800
of trouble and even satirized by my teachers for being cynical about it but I'm not about to believe

01:27:41.800 --> 01:27:48.440
anything that I don't know is certain right so that's that's the kind of faith that that Heschel

01:27:48.440 --> 01:28:01.480
is calling science and it's uh it's uh you know it's it's it's an important way way to work okay

01:28:02.200 --> 01:28:11.080
so we'll we'll take a break and we'll come back and do the the crisis of the European Sciences

01:28:14.600 --> 01:28:24.200
okay we're gonna pick up with what I believe is the the most beautiful passage of phenomenological

01:28:24.200 --> 01:28:27.640
prose ever written so beautiful I felt that too

01:28:30.840 --> 01:28:39.240
which passage one I would even call it poetry uh it's on page 56

01:28:41.720 --> 01:28:50.040
under K the section is fundamental significance of the problem of the origin of mathematical

01:28:50.040 --> 01:28:55.960
natural science okay it's uh starts on line five the second sentence

01:29:09.080 --> 01:29:14.840
well that's important it's it's kind I it's so beautiful I want you to come in right when it

01:29:14.840 --> 01:29:22.120
can grab you it's like when you're when you're studying a tape uh one of the great thing about

01:29:22.120 --> 01:29:28.120
the digitizing of the tapes is you can bounce right on the exact start of the data that you're

01:29:28.120 --> 01:29:34.600
looking for if you have in the old days when you had to rewind oh I remember there was something

01:29:34.600 --> 01:29:40.040
great that he just said that relates to this after you spent 10 minutes looking for it and then

01:29:40.040 --> 01:29:46.200
losing your place whether you're before it or after it the enthusiasm of your mind is gone

01:29:46.200 --> 01:29:53.720
and so you can't attend to it so I want it's so good I want your enthusiasm to be to be eager

01:29:53.720 --> 01:30:03.480
and ready okay fifth line the developed method the developed method the progressive fulfillment

01:30:03.480 --> 01:30:14.440
of the task is as method and art which is handed down but its true meaning is not necessarily

01:30:14.440 --> 01:30:22.440
handed down with it and it is precisely for this reason that a theoretical task and achievement

01:30:22.440 --> 01:30:29.000
like that of a natural science or any science of the world which can master the infinity of

01:30:29.000 --> 01:30:35.320
its subject matter only through infinities of method and can master the latter infinities only

01:30:35.320 --> 01:30:43.400
by means of a technical thought and activity which are empty of meaning can only be and remain meaningful

01:30:43.400 --> 01:30:51.560
in a true and original sense if the scientist has developed in himself the ability to inquire back

01:30:52.280 --> 01:31:00.760
into the original meaning of all his meaning structures and methods that is into the historical

01:31:00.760 --> 01:31:08.040
meaning of their primal establishment and especially into the meaning of all their inherited

01:31:08.040 --> 01:31:17.000
meanings taken over unnoticed in this primal establishment as well as those taken over later

01:31:17.000 --> 01:31:32.760
on okay that's just wonderful it's talking about the way that science proceeds by necessarily by

01:31:32.760 --> 01:31:40.280
relying on method but how the method eventually becomes empty of meaning I mean I got him was

01:31:40.280 --> 01:31:47.160
talking about that in truth and method you need the method but the method is not where truth lies

01:31:47.960 --> 01:31:53.720
right it's not where the real objectivity is and you can't convince people in the coffee world

01:31:54.680 --> 01:32:00.520
who've invested hundreds of thousands of dollars in these methods you can't convince them that

01:32:00.600 --> 01:32:10.440
that's not where certainty and truth are and they're suspicious of of of something subjective but

01:32:11.560 --> 01:32:20.120
okay using coffee tasting as an example if it involves your tongue it's got to be subjective

01:32:20.440 --> 01:32:30.360
and so to pretend that it's not is to not be objective if there's a subjective component

01:32:30.360 --> 01:32:36.920
in reaching the objectivity of the taste then you have to admit that subjective component

01:32:36.920 --> 01:32:43.080
they get that a bk coffee that's why I was so enthused two days ago they understand that and

01:32:43.080 --> 01:32:48.840
they're not denying that and they still develop their technique they still develop their method

01:32:48.840 --> 01:32:54.920
because you have to have a method and the method becomes a technique and you master the infinity

01:32:54.920 --> 01:33:00.520
of its subject matter all the flavors of coffee only through the infinities of method and you become

01:33:00.520 --> 01:33:09.160
technically expertise at doing that but it can only remain meaningful if you inquire back into

01:33:10.920 --> 01:33:16.920
how you develop those methods in the first place what were you finding what were you witnessing

01:33:17.720 --> 01:33:23.800
I mean he's describing the fate of all objectivities here and the fate of all objectivities is to

01:33:23.800 --> 01:33:33.240
become thinner and thinner in meaning to less and less of that original awareness certainly not

01:33:33.240 --> 01:33:40.440
the horizon of meaning in which the the method was developed you know coffee tasters realized

01:33:40.440 --> 01:33:45.720
they needed to keep track and it was good to keep track in this way and then you come up with

01:33:45.720 --> 01:33:54.200
different ways some forms do it from one to ten some forms do it from they have a form a couple

01:33:54.200 --> 01:34:08.600
of excellence where i'm going uh next week in El Salvador they do uh zero four six and eight

01:34:08.920 --> 01:34:19.640
zero four six and eight it's not it's not equal and that that changes the results the uh the

01:34:19.640 --> 01:34:28.680
specialty coffees of Italy they do one to seven so you get a lot of fours and fives okay hard to

01:34:28.680 --> 01:34:37.720
get a lot of fours and fives on a form that's zero four six and eight right but anyway you develop

01:34:37.800 --> 01:34:43.560
you develop your method for for whatever good reason that you have but you forget what the good

01:34:43.560 --> 01:34:49.080
reason is and then you just do it by rote and when you do it by rote you're not going to do it as

01:34:49.080 --> 01:34:58.760
well that's who shows notion he's saying that that the the the mathematical natural scientists

01:34:58.760 --> 01:35:06.120
have to go back into the historical meanings and capture what did you inherit you know when you read

01:35:06.840 --> 01:35:15.560
the the textbook in mathematics in in grammar school and high school and college uh what were

01:35:15.560 --> 01:35:24.200
the inherited meanings and then what what were and a lot of those meanings you didn't even notice

01:35:24.200 --> 01:35:30.360
you kind of like they were like subliminal and you maybe discovered them later even um

01:35:31.000 --> 01:35:37.240
um and then there's things that you take over later on accretions as as mathematical science

01:35:37.240 --> 01:35:42.600
develops as your career develops as you do your research here there in this other areas you pick

01:35:42.600 --> 01:35:53.080
up things there's a there's a development and so part of the concern of phenomenology is to not

01:35:53.080 --> 01:36:03.080
just take things as static but to go back and find the originary sense originary that's another word

01:36:03.080 --> 01:36:10.920
that that microsoft will well not a lot right uh but it's a technical who's showing term and it's

01:36:10.920 --> 01:36:14.840
a term that's very much under criticism and we won't go into that here but the postmodernists

01:36:14.840 --> 01:36:21.160
say there's no such thing as original derrida says everything is derivative and he's right but

01:36:21.160 --> 01:36:26.520
pusher only means there's a point at which you first put the idea together given a natural

01:36:26.520 --> 01:36:32.120
experience that actual experience exists you can go back that far you know there's not they're not

01:36:32.120 --> 01:36:39.480
original in the sense of that of a need so you want to keep aware then of the synthetic activities

01:36:39.480 --> 01:36:45.960
of producing these unities of sense and not and not just accept the unities of sense as docile

01:36:46.840 --> 01:36:54.680
cultural objects so again there's seeing and then then in categorically informed seeing is seeing

01:36:54.680 --> 01:37:03.400
that that that captures the process of cat categorizing and synthesizing um i mean it seems

01:37:03.400 --> 01:37:09.560
like it's impossible because there's no piercing seeing already involves all that

01:37:10.040 --> 01:37:16.760
on of course i won't talk about this there's a kind of seeing in the Tibetan system that they say

01:37:16.760 --> 01:37:25.240
is direct and unmediated but i think that's mythology but i'm not sure anyway i'm i'm

01:37:25.240 --> 01:37:30.920
planning on investigating it in the next couple of years but it's part of this debate i'm not

01:37:31.000 --> 01:37:43.080
forcing crucial onto them so uh he's acknowledging again here on page 56 the limits of positive

01:37:43.080 --> 01:37:49.080
science when he says the mathematician the natural scientist at best a highly brilliant

01:37:49.080 --> 01:37:55.720
technician of the method i mean that's a respectful put down right a highly brilliant

01:37:55.720 --> 01:38:00.600
technician of the method and hushall was a mathematician i mean he had no reason to dislike

01:38:00.600 --> 01:38:10.040
mathematicians but he wanted to basically find to ground truth and certainties as a mathematician

01:38:10.760 --> 01:38:17.960
and he wasn't able to do it and it fascinated him so he began to become a philosopher to explore

01:38:18.680 --> 01:38:27.640
why that wasn't possible i'm 57 uh in the middle of that paragraph that's over there

01:38:28.200 --> 01:38:34.680
he says every attempt to lead the scientist to such reflections if it comes from a mathematical

01:38:34.680 --> 01:38:40.600
non scientific circle of scholars is rejected as metaphysical okay this is what we would call

01:38:40.600 --> 01:38:50.120
an australia a winch he's winching he's complaining that that that oh this criticism is is is

01:38:50.120 --> 01:38:57.480
uh we're not doing metaphysics that they put down people doing that and it's going on this very

01:38:57.480 --> 01:39:05.880
minute as i speak there's a movement at the university of fryberg to remove the chair

01:39:05.880 --> 01:39:12.120
that hushall and heidegger occupy that gunty figal presently occupies they want to remove it and

01:39:12.120 --> 01:39:19.160
replace it with an analytic philosopher and so the whole world is screaming and i don't know

01:39:19.160 --> 01:39:26.440
what the politics are on that campus but it shows you that i mean i mean hushall was there at fryberg

01:39:26.440 --> 01:39:35.560
when he was writing this sentence and uh things have only gotten worse right so uh it's it's not

01:39:35.560 --> 01:39:44.360
like there's a happy ending yet well it's changing the academic style and uh power play it's pure

01:39:45.000 --> 01:39:50.600
mega trend of analytic philosophers eradicating everybody else yeah they did that in holland

01:39:50.600 --> 01:39:56.120
completely there's nobody doing anything non-agletical in language for example well there's

01:39:56.120 --> 01:40:02.520
there's a hardy department there's the center for the study of subjectivity at the university of

01:40:02.520 --> 01:40:07.880
Copenhagen yeah i talked about holland oh holland right sorry but i mean then certain areas i mean

01:40:07.880 --> 01:40:15.400
we can see that they just burn and escape and they do in germany at the moment so and they will do it here

01:40:15.480 --> 01:40:24.760
maybe and so his argument is that if positive scientists in no way inquired into the unexamined

01:40:25.320 --> 01:40:31.080
taken for granted received method then then there won't be this difference between science and

01:40:31.640 --> 01:40:39.000
and naive everyday practitioner i mean what distinguishes science is this capacity to

01:40:39.000 --> 01:40:44.680
turn the gaze back on itself this is what science is uh

01:40:47.320 --> 01:40:56.680
but it takes longer to do it stalls you you can't move forward as quickly okay let's let's uh

01:40:57.240 --> 01:40:59.240
uh look at uh

01:41:02.760 --> 01:41:03.400
i forget

01:41:05.400 --> 01:41:09.400
okay

01:41:09.400 --> 01:41:14.360
um on the next page um

01:41:15.240 --> 01:41:16.040
um

01:41:19.240 --> 01:41:27.560
which is 105 pages later um let's look at uh at 163 oh

01:41:30.840 --> 01:41:37.240
he was a mathematician yeah one two seventeen sorry joke

01:41:38.200 --> 01:41:40.120
um

01:41:44.120 --> 01:41:52.120
here he says um let's see well i want to read a couple of sections here um

01:41:54.600 --> 01:41:58.120
i just have to find them

01:41:58.920 --> 01:42:11.240
okay uh let's start with the middle paragraph on 163 but instead of inquiring further in the sphere

01:42:11.240 --> 01:42:16.280
of our own intuition so let's turn our attention to the fact that in our continuously flowing world

01:42:16.280 --> 01:42:24.760
proceeding now that continuously is very big news right and he uses that continuously also at line

01:42:24.760 --> 01:42:33.400
three of 164 that continuously is uh is the ongoing character of events it's the no time out

01:42:34.200 --> 01:42:42.280
it's the uh the the floating crab game that garfinkel's talking about um that is you don't

01:42:42.280 --> 01:42:49.880
want to reduce affairs to some kind of static sociology which is what most positive sociologists

01:42:49.880 --> 01:42:59.640
do so uh in our continuously flowing world proceeding we are not isolated but rather have

01:42:59.640 --> 01:43:07.320
within a contact with other human beings right it's a very frank uh attention to social phenomena

01:43:08.040 --> 01:43:15.400
each one has his perceptions his presentations his harmonious experiences the valuation of

01:43:15.400 --> 01:43:22.120
his certainties into mere possibilities right plenty of those doubts questions illusions

01:43:22.680 --> 01:43:27.240
but in living with one another each one can take part in the life of the others

01:43:28.120 --> 01:43:33.240
thus in general the world exists not only for isolated men but for the community of men

01:43:33.800 --> 01:43:39.400
and this is due to the fact that even what is straightforwardly perceptual is communalized

01:43:39.400 --> 01:43:48.760
in this communalization too there constantly occurs an alteration of validity through reciprocal

01:43:48.760 --> 01:43:55.080
correction in reciprocal understanding and i think he gets this reciprocal from simul because

01:43:55.080 --> 01:44:04.440
simul talked about uh reciprocal stimulation as the core interest of sociology uh looking at

01:44:04.440 --> 01:44:11.400
the sociality uh in reciprocal understanding my experiences and experiential acquisitions

01:44:11.400 --> 01:44:19.080
enter into contact with those of others so this this reciprocal correction reciprocal

01:44:19.080 --> 01:44:27.800
understanding is a very general gloss but what is it a gloss for we still have to fully explore

01:44:27.800 --> 01:44:33.880
this that's what we're doing i think in ethno methodology there's this kind of these meanings

01:44:33.880 --> 01:44:40.280
these unities of meanings that are produced and stabilized fall apart in this reciprocal

01:44:41.000 --> 01:44:48.200
so they're so we have to kind of correct them uh and the validity's get altered a little bit

01:44:48.200 --> 01:44:55.400
and they get restabilized and so my hope is i can record enough coffee tasters to see how

01:44:55.400 --> 01:45:00.040
they're stabilizing those unities of meaning when they come apart because the coffees are

01:45:00.040 --> 01:45:06.840
going to throw them apart i mean coffees do i mean it was amazing two days ago there was one

01:45:06.840 --> 01:45:13.240
coffee that was totally smooth i would say like like a base and then there was the next coffee

01:45:13.240 --> 01:45:20.360
was like a tenor just singing high flavored fruity notes i mean there were like six coffees on the

01:45:20.360 --> 01:45:25.880
table four completely different flavors you wouldn't you think they were different different

01:45:26.680 --> 01:45:34.200
plants um so so there's always a point at which the categories are going to fall short

01:45:35.080 --> 01:45:41.480
you can pin them in the categories but you want to preserve what is unique about that coffee that

01:45:41.480 --> 01:45:47.080
you're thinking of paying big bucks for i mean one of them was a very expensive coffee that in fact

01:45:47.080 --> 01:45:52.600
he loved it but he felt he wouldn't be able to afford it because they can't be putting

01:45:52.600 --> 01:45:59.880
super expensive coffee because they produce so much of it that it's going to be super expensive to buy

01:45:59.880 --> 01:46:06.920
that much right and and then once they put it in they have to commit to paying that for the long

01:46:06.920 --> 01:46:12.360
run so they also have to think about what it's going to cost later in years to come or else

01:46:12.360 --> 01:46:18.520
their clients will get pissed off being hooked on that flavor i mean that's a different seminar

01:46:19.160 --> 01:46:25.000
but anyway but we're talking about reciprocal correction i mean they're trying to re-establish

01:46:25.560 --> 01:46:33.480
the the efficacy and and vitality of these categorical uh unities that they're producing

01:46:35.160 --> 01:46:41.400
and it's there's no time out i mean it's the world is always going to fall apart and come back

01:46:41.400 --> 01:46:46.440
together and then later in that paragraph we won't read it all talking about intersubjective

01:46:46.440 --> 01:46:53.880
harmony of validity and intersubjective unity so you get this intersubjectivity which you know okay

01:46:54.520 --> 01:46:59.720
this i would say all of us ethnomethodologists garfinkel included we're thrilled with this

01:46:59.720 --> 01:47:03.960
notion of intersubjectivity he had the anniversary of his life although he always talked about

01:47:03.960 --> 01:47:07.960
intersubjectivity from the very beginning but he makes a bigger deal a bit later and we're all

01:47:07.960 --> 01:47:15.320
interested but at the end we realize it's just a it's just a gloss that intersubjective kind of

01:47:15.320 --> 01:47:21.000
like says everybody stands alone and then they come together but it's not like that they're together

01:47:21.000 --> 01:47:30.440
first and so i i i'm i'm not happy with the with using the term intersubjective um but still

01:47:31.160 --> 01:47:39.080
the phenomena the the real world experience that intersubjective unity is is an intersubjective

01:47:39.080 --> 01:47:45.160
discrepancies is addressing those real world phenomena are what we're studying we just have to

01:47:45.160 --> 01:47:56.360
find more appropriate uh ways of describing okay so so you get this this social term in uh in

01:47:57.240 --> 01:48:01.960
the crisis of the european sciences which came at the end of his life and he couldn't avoid the

01:48:01.960 --> 01:48:08.200
social because by that time he'd been kicked out of his job at fryberg because the nazis took over

01:48:08.200 --> 01:48:17.080
and he was jewish and uh and you couldn't deny the social importance of social affairs and the

01:48:17.800 --> 01:48:24.120
the origin of geometry took what wrote uh was was delivered i think in chakrasilakia

01:48:25.560 --> 01:48:35.080
in prog um uh and uh i think it was maybe a year before he died two years before he died

01:48:35.960 --> 01:48:44.120
when he was practically he couldn't go lecture in germany um and uh derrida wrote his

01:48:44.120 --> 01:48:49.960
doctoral dissertation on the origin of geometry um and he's written a lot about it this is kind of

01:48:49.960 --> 01:48:57.000
kind of interesting very clear derrida you don't get a lot of it that i mean derrida i i mean i i

01:48:57.000 --> 01:49:05.720
like him very much but uh but his earlier material his book on on the origin of geometry is is one

01:49:05.720 --> 01:49:17.960
of his clearest um the uh it's a it's a it's not a really long article and and garfinkel has a paper

01:49:17.960 --> 01:49:26.840
on this in human studies i don't know 2005 maybe i'm not sure or yeah i maybe could be earlier

01:49:27.800 --> 01:49:34.760
um and you know he recognized well that all scientific constructions are

01:49:34.760 --> 01:49:44.920
products of the cultural world um and he asks mostly how these scientific products get to

01:49:44.920 --> 01:49:54.280
be objective so he asks in a very radical way uh and you you see that uh in the bottom of 357

01:49:54.280 --> 01:50:03.960
in the footnote okay um he says are more precisely in the line three four they have their objectivity

01:50:03.960 --> 01:50:13.880
their existence for everyone uh so is that what objectivity is how they exist for everybody

01:50:13.880 --> 01:50:26.120
in a kind of similar way um he says uh above the page about a third of the way down the sensible

01:50:26.120 --> 01:50:36.040
utterances on 357 still have spatiotemporal individuation in the world like all corporeal

01:50:36.040 --> 01:50:43.640
occurrences that he's talking about indexicality there indexical expressions have a corporeal

01:50:43.640 --> 01:50:50.600
nature to them they're they're the the term the utterances the words are like bodies because they

01:50:50.600 --> 01:50:56.680
have a sound uh they're they're tangible but tangible has to do with touch i don't know if

01:50:56.680 --> 01:51:04.920
there's a similar word for sound but but they're there in the world and they can become a focal

01:51:04.920 --> 01:51:10.840
point for a lot of times when you we do our studies this came out particularly when i was

01:51:10.840 --> 01:51:18.440
looking at intercultural conversations uh there were many situations in which persons like chinese

01:51:18.440 --> 01:51:25.000
visiting the us they knew that something was very important in the conversation a passage

01:51:25.000 --> 01:51:29.720
they kept getting repeated with a certain energy but they didn't know what it meant but they knew

01:51:29.720 --> 01:51:34.360
that that was the core of what they were supposed to understand so you know something without knowing

01:51:34.360 --> 01:51:44.440
what it is so there's that corporeal nature and that provides then the focal point for the the

01:51:44.440 --> 01:52:00.520
chinese and american participants in a conversation um so it's it's this observation i think

01:52:01.400 --> 01:52:09.160
illustrates this process of objectivation that that this tangibility is produced by the objectivation

01:52:09.160 --> 01:52:15.480
we need that in order so people can get on the same page even though they're not sure what's on

01:52:15.480 --> 01:52:23.720
the page still the material facticity of a gloss or of an account or an utterance allows it to serve

01:52:23.720 --> 01:52:31.320
as the vehicle for what gerbage calls in a fabulous phrase but in the end it's only a gloss that

01:52:31.320 --> 01:52:41.160
doesn't yet mean enough intersubjective concatenation of meaning that is the the the way in which people

01:52:41.160 --> 01:52:52.760
do this reciprocal uh correction this reciprocal interconcatenation uh the um which are all just

01:52:52.760 --> 01:53:02.520
names but but you need some you need an object you need a place for people to come together you need

01:53:03.480 --> 01:53:07.000
the corporeal character of the occurrence is what hostel's saying here

01:53:08.840 --> 01:53:17.160
um i mean he gets really specific i think a little further down maybe it's in the main text not the

01:53:17.160 --> 01:53:25.000
footnote it's three six nine lines from the bottom of the main larger text on page 357 he says

01:53:25.000 --> 01:53:33.800
wherever something is asserted one can distinguish what is thematic that about which it is said

01:53:34.760 --> 01:53:38.040
okay that about which it is said

01:53:38.040 --> 01:53:49.000
uh but uh and sometimes that's all we have and i like to think of it as the an empty palette

01:53:49.000 --> 01:53:57.880
that remains to be loaded and people will then start loading it uh like uh like like what is full

01:53:57.880 --> 01:54:07.720
body what is medium body uh and people have the term they have this thematic object it's a gloss

01:54:08.200 --> 01:54:16.360
for what garfinkel says it's a gloss for whatever comes to me he said the the uh he in his studies

01:54:16.360 --> 01:54:24.120
of games with rules he says that that rules consist of their consequences right i mean that's not

01:54:24.120 --> 01:54:28.520
how people i said the rules the rules of the rules they have to know what they are ahead of time

01:54:28.520 --> 01:54:34.440
no it's not like that i mean it can be on rare occasions but it's not

01:54:36.840 --> 01:54:43.160
so as social phenomenologists we want to track the local history of that production

01:54:44.600 --> 01:54:53.080
and uh you know the the temporality that pushover wrote a lot about is in fact the temporality that

01:54:53.880 --> 01:55:00.840
that we're trying to capture in our studies of of naturally occurring interaction

01:55:02.280 --> 01:55:05.640
so he poses a fabulous question at the bottom of 357

01:55:07.320 --> 01:55:14.200
how does geometrical ideality just like that of all sciences proceed from its primary

01:55:14.200 --> 01:55:21.080
intrapersonal that is one person alone origin where it is a structure within the conscious space

01:55:21.080 --> 01:55:30.520
of the first inventor's soul to its ideal objectivity ideal referring to the uh the

01:55:31.320 --> 01:55:38.840
the self-identical meaning unity that is shared by everybody in the group uh so that's the way

01:55:38.840 --> 01:55:45.640
hosso poses the question and you know for me the first inventor's soul is a step too far uh

01:55:45.720 --> 01:55:50.200
i mean i don't know about souls and i don't know about lone inventors um

01:55:51.800 --> 01:56:00.840
i want to reverse that and my argument which which i don't think i haven't convinced i haven't

01:56:00.840 --> 01:56:05.800
gotten sahabi to listen to the argument yet uh because every time i make it he says yeah

01:56:07.800 --> 01:56:12.760
but he doesn't know that if he's saying that if he's always asking how do we get from the

01:56:12.760 --> 01:56:19.720
individual's inventor soul to to the inter subjective i want to know how do we get from

01:56:19.720 --> 01:56:27.240
the inter subjective to the individual i'm reversing that um and i think we need to do a lot of that

01:56:29.240 --> 01:56:34.760
um i mean it can be the story the way hosso phrases it it's possible to proceed from one

01:56:34.760 --> 01:56:40.680
creative idea to its objectivation and so move from the subjective to the inter subjective

01:56:40.680 --> 01:56:45.640
but i don't think that's usually how it happens i think it's only an ideal version and not the

01:56:45.640 --> 01:56:51.800
real version uh because what we have is always already there uh and how did it get there how

01:56:51.800 --> 01:56:57.480
does this receive stuff that we passively the whole passive synthesis of glycerol i think

01:56:58.040 --> 01:57:05.800
i don't know enough i i have to spend a good year uh reading through those texts um that passive

01:57:05.800 --> 01:57:14.280
synthesis is full of insight and then in the end maybe as a cop out i don't know uh uh but but i

01:57:15.000 --> 01:57:22.760
i want to to look at more i mean with either way we do work now with with our attention to local

01:57:22.760 --> 01:57:29.560
detail with the assistance of digital recordings i mean i think we can really discover these things

01:57:29.560 --> 01:57:36.200
from the real world as hosso and garfinkel are both recommending uh and you could say oh yeah it's

01:57:36.200 --> 01:57:41.640
both you know you know it can happen one way it can happen the other way uh or you could say

01:57:41.640 --> 01:57:45.880
a lot is that oh yeah there's some kind of dialectics at work which is it's too vague

01:57:45.880 --> 01:57:52.280
to be really helpful and usually when philosophers say it they're secretly keeping the subjective

01:57:52.280 --> 01:57:59.480
this primary this cartesian subject somehow won't die um if there's going to be any original and

01:57:59.480 --> 01:58:10.280
if not uh it would be what hosso is here calling the inner subject he says i'm one on three five

01:58:10.280 --> 01:58:17.880
three fifty eight uh about two thirds of the way down a reciprocal getting along with others

01:58:17.880 --> 01:58:24.840
okay i mean this that's that's i mean you couldn't say at the methodology is a study of the reciprocal

01:58:24.840 --> 01:58:34.520
getting along with others i mean that's that would be adequate uh but maybe it doesn't approach the

01:58:34.520 --> 01:58:45.400
radical character of what we've come upon um on the next page line three three fifty nine he says uh

01:58:48.520 --> 01:58:53.560
in this sense civilization is for every man who's we horizon it is a community of those

01:58:53.560 --> 01:59:00.840
who can reciprocally express themselves so this reciprocal which i'm maintaining he gets from

01:59:00.840 --> 01:59:08.840
simil because uh it's in simil and he was reading simil's books and there's all these books by simil

01:59:08.840 --> 01:59:15.560
well doggiered in uh was early in library in living um

01:59:18.840 --> 01:59:28.920
that um that this this reciprocal expressing is is uh is i think uh important

01:59:31.560 --> 01:59:41.000
uh i mean that's a reference i think uh although not blatant to the what hosso would call

01:59:41.000 --> 01:59:49.480
originary character of inner subjective life um and also on the next page three sixty he comes

01:59:49.480 --> 01:59:56.600
up with this term co-accomplishment in the middle of the page a co-accomplishment what kind there's

01:59:56.600 --> 02:00:10.520
no individual there the co is is of course you know a small syllable very vague and and in any case

02:00:10.520 --> 02:00:15.320
there's not really accomplishing going because that retains the cartesian sense that we're in

02:00:15.400 --> 02:00:25.320
control of everything but the the the lockian uh sense that that we're in charge uh we have to

02:00:25.320 --> 02:00:32.040
depart the enlightenment and discover and that's what sociology really is is is realizing the sense

02:00:32.040 --> 02:00:41.320
in which the the structure like of the turn taking uh is running the show a lot of the time it's it's

02:00:41.320 --> 02:00:52.520
not it's not that uh that that i'm being dishonest when when uh when there's a misunderstanding and i

02:00:52.520 --> 02:00:59.080
don't explain the misunderstanding it's that i just didn't get a chance to talk because the

02:00:59.080 --> 02:01:04.680
conversation didn't provide me with a turn and then the person said well why didn't you correct me

02:01:04.680 --> 02:01:11.640
you know they feel wounded right but it's it's these things kind of run themselves we're not in

02:01:11.640 --> 02:01:17.960
charge of everything in the rational decision science way that comes out of the enlightenment

02:01:17.960 --> 02:01:27.480
mom so anyway this co-accomplishment though uh is uh needs our the kind of specification

02:01:27.480 --> 02:01:35.240
re-specification that we're able to give to it uh and we give to it following the methodological

02:01:35.240 --> 02:01:40.040
the principal methodological rule of our soul which is not theories but the things themselves

02:01:42.760 --> 02:01:53.320
so uh um he's moving in the in the direction that we want but um i'm not sure that that his

02:01:53.320 --> 02:02:04.600
attempts to explain it is always helpful um he says uh just a little bit below on 360 uh the

02:02:04.600 --> 02:02:16.840
productions below what below the co-accomplishment uh the productions can reproduce their likenesses

02:02:16.840 --> 02:02:22.760
from person to person well i don't know if that's how it happens reproduce it as though they exist

02:02:22.840 --> 02:02:28.360
before and then the chain of the understanding of these repetitions what is self-evident turns

02:02:28.360 --> 02:02:35.240
up as the same in the consciousness of the other uh that's that's a first attempt okay but it's

02:02:35.240 --> 02:02:41.720
hardly the situation in the unity of the community of communication among several persons the repeatedly

02:02:41.720 --> 02:02:48.680
produced structure becomes an object of consciousness not as a likeness but as the one structure

02:02:48.680 --> 02:02:54.040
common to all well all by that it does become that the question is how does it become the one

02:02:54.040 --> 02:03:01.000
structure common to all this is social work this is sociality this is the term that symbol

02:03:01.000 --> 02:03:09.160
use this is what we what people are doing all the time is somehow get the one structure in common

02:03:09.160 --> 02:03:15.640
that's why when i go to london i get scolded when i'm waiting in the bus line i mean i'm not budding

02:03:15.640 --> 02:03:24.840
in but i'm just not participating in making this one structure common to all right so uh so this is

02:03:24.840 --> 02:03:38.680
worth that people do and they do it in different ways in different places um so uh and that structure

02:03:38.680 --> 02:03:46.120
come to all it's also dirt climbing um who shall ask how does the geometry he says the

02:03:46.120 --> 02:03:54.520
primarily establishing geom geometry uh i'm not sure that that's adequate uh how does the

02:03:54.520 --> 02:04:03.800
geometry express transform his internal structure in its ideality into something objective that's

02:04:03.800 --> 02:04:11.080
that's really what we're interested in or he says on 159 how does the oh yeah i i read now um

02:04:13.480 --> 02:04:19.880
then then he says uh back on 356 toward the bottom

02:04:23.560 --> 02:04:33.720
and i wrote that out because i was at home and my my scanners was dying and i was desperate

02:04:34.760 --> 02:04:49.880
um the uh he says the original where is that the original being itself there um

02:04:52.920 --> 02:04:57.160
an original self evidence i'm not sure

02:04:57.320 --> 02:05:03.720
oh no is it sorry it's on it's on 359

02:05:05.800 --> 02:05:07.800
so i have a mistake in my notes

02:05:13.560 --> 02:05:19.960
uh toward the bottom uh the original being itself there in the immediate

02:05:20.040 --> 02:05:27.080
sea of its first production that is in original self evidence that's a very big term that's

02:05:27.080 --> 02:05:33.560
where we're truth is things we really know for sure that we experience results in no

02:05:33.560 --> 02:05:39.880
persisting acquisition at all that could have objective existence that is the original moment

02:05:39.880 --> 02:05:46.440
when i have an insight when i'm tasting that coffee and i capture that flavor and i have no idea

02:05:46.440 --> 02:05:53.560
how to describe it it's like it's like let's say a basket of fruit you know what do i what

02:05:53.560 --> 02:06:01.480
how do i make this a persisting acquisition that that can lead to a lot of people communicating

02:06:01.480 --> 02:06:12.440
about uh this is is such an important question that's our goal is to make our insights persisting

02:06:12.440 --> 02:06:18.840
acquisitions that's why we need to objectivate them that's why we develop accounts and formulations

02:06:18.840 --> 02:06:27.640
that persisting acquisition is everybody's daily work what hustle describes does happen pretty

02:06:27.640 --> 02:06:37.720
much along the ways that he describes um but these objectivities are maybe already there uh

02:06:38.440 --> 02:06:47.080
uh we they land in our lap passively as much as their active productions that we could go back

02:06:47.080 --> 02:06:55.000
and do an archaeology of an excavation of and find out like what we were we're reading uh among

02:06:55.560 --> 02:07:03.160
the the geometers and mathematicians uh that you can excavate and get where to start where

02:07:03.160 --> 02:07:10.120
to go next where to go next we're already having these persisting acquisitions and that they persist

02:07:10.120 --> 02:07:17.880
is recommends that we keep them that we that we retain them we might not even know what round

02:07:17.880 --> 02:07:23.880
means to describe coffee but everybody's using the term so it's not going away so i might as well

02:07:23.880 --> 02:07:30.920
understand what it means so we we need these acquisitions because they're part of the of the

02:07:31.640 --> 02:07:37.320
of the palette it's not an empty palette they're a palette filled they're filled with this term

02:07:37.320 --> 02:07:44.840
round and with different kind of senses so now how do we coordinate and reciprocally bring these

02:07:44.840 --> 02:07:54.040
understandings into some kind of uh of of unity and if you look on 361 you might then be able to

02:07:54.040 --> 02:08:00.360
understand this wonderful passage on this paragraph just below the middle on 361

02:08:03.400 --> 02:08:10.600
and uh we might even end with this there is a distinction then between passively understanding

02:08:10.600 --> 02:08:15.640
the expression and making itself evident by reactivating its meaning

02:08:15.960 --> 02:08:26.120
but there are also exist possibilities of a kind of activity a thinking in terms of things

02:08:26.120 --> 02:08:33.080
that have been taken up merely receptively passively which deals with significations only

02:08:33.080 --> 02:08:40.440
passively understood and taken over without any of the self evidence of original activity

02:08:41.080 --> 02:08:47.880
that's what i find amazing and why i included that in your reading is that's the point i'm trying

02:08:47.880 --> 02:08:58.280
to make i mean husho often sees the flaw in his thinking he sees the most original solutions to

02:08:58.280 --> 02:09:04.920
the problems and he even begins to describe them as he does here but then when he goes back to

02:09:04.920 --> 02:09:10.040
recapping the general theory he seems to like like forget about them because it's too hard

02:09:10.440 --> 02:09:17.880
and too indeterminate to uh to describe that but my critique that i just gave you

02:09:17.880 --> 02:09:25.000
three minutes ago is in this passage you know maybe without any of the self evidence of original

02:09:25.000 --> 02:09:35.160
activity so i'm amazed that uh that husho is just incredibly deep and so all i wanted to do today

02:09:35.160 --> 02:09:43.880
was to convey to you and to people in ethno methodology that husho's deep okay and this

02:09:44.680 --> 02:09:52.520
i'll leave it to you to reactivate and re-specify but that deepness is uh if you can use it if you

02:09:52.520 --> 02:10:01.560
can't use it you know i'm not going to insist on it but um i'm i would say by way of concluding that

02:10:01.560 --> 02:10:13.320
that one of my earliest professors peter berger would be very proud of me right now
