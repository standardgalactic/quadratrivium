0	25320	The questions that Hussle raises are incredibly deep, and I don't know that one seminar is
25320	36720	sufficient to expose this depth to you, but I know the readings are very difficult and I can
36720	44600	explain the readings, so that's a small victory. Are you threatening us with the more Hussle seminars?
44600	53160	Yeah, let's talk about that a little. What you have here is a selection of
53440	64720	short passages, which in itself makes it difficult, from five different texts. That is,
64720	73680	logical investigations, ideas, formal and transcendental logic, the crisis of the European
73680	81240	sciences, and the origin of geometry, and that's the order in which they were written from 1899
81240	100920	to 1936, 37 maybe. Normally, I gave them to you in the order that they were written,
100920	105400	because it seemed logical, and that's how I'll explain it, because they built up on it,
105400	112200	but actually I read them in reverse order. That is, I read the crisis and the geometry first,
112200	120920	because Harold told me to, and that's what he considered was most important, and they're the
120920	127240	most relevant and most accessible to sociologists, because they ask social questions and historical
127240	135880	questions. From there, I worked back to ideas and formal and transcendental logic in the middle
135880	143280	space, and at the very last, I did the 700-page, two-volume, tome logical investigations, working
143280	151080	with one of the world's top Heideggerian scholars, Frederick Golovsson, over six months in a graduate
151400	158000	seminar, and that's the most obscure, and so you're starting out reading the most obscure,
158000	169400	and you're reading short selections, so don't blame yourself if it was hard. However, Husserl did
169400	177160	have a very important influence on garfinkel, and it's an influence that has been underestimated
177160	184200	by most people who never studied with garfinkel. Originally, they just read Husserl out, because
184200	191880	they just didn't have an interest themselves, I think. I'm not sure why. They got that he was
191880	197000	interested in Wittgenstein, and he was, but he was always more interested in Husserl, and of course
197000	206840	they treat, they address similar issues. That denial has been transformed in recent years, judging
206840	213480	from what I read and the emails I get, to a kind of theory of a term. Heidegger has this term,
213480	218760	the early Heidegger and the late Heidegger. Well, they have developed a kind of account of garfinkel
218760	226600	that he was a phenomenologist, and somehow later rejected Husserl and rejected the phenomenology.
226600	231480	He never rejected it. He wrote, he had an article on Husserl, one of the last articles he ever wrote
231480	238840	in human studies. He never took phenomenology on its own terms. He only took anything on his terms,
240040	245720	and it's a very unique reading, and it's a very valuable reading, and it's the kind of reading
245720	253880	that I'm doing, and giving. But the vitality of ethnomethodology, at least the vitality of
253880	262440	garfinkel's project, started with his reading of Husserl. That's where he got the energy and the
262440	266440	interest. And that becomes very clear if you read his doctoral dissertation, which is now available
266440	276120	in book form in this, in this book, I think it's paradigm press edited by Anne Rawls called
276120	285480	Seeing Sociologically 2006. It's a fairly easy read, actually. And it's very clear that Husserl
285480	296600	particularly played an important role in his formative stages when he was first grappling with
296600	304360	how to study ordinary society. Of course, he was reading after World War II in the late 40s
304360	309400	and through the 50s, and there were no English translations then of Husserl. I think the first
309400	321800	translations of anything serious was in 62 by an Australian. And, you know, it's, he was reading
321800	333480	Marvin Farber, he was reading Maurice Nathanson, he was reading Aaron Gervitch, who summarized
333480	339640	Husserl's arguments in their English language articles. And this is what he lived and breathed
339640	348600	in the late 40s and early 50s. And then he started paying students when he became a professor to
348600	353160	translate from the German, because he didn't read German himself, although he had a good sense for
353160	360440	the, for the energy of the language. He had, he would hire students to translate Husserlian text
360440	367560	from, that were only available in English and German into English. So for people to say, oh he
367560	376120	wasn't, Husserl wasn't a big influence, it's complete nonsense. But, and, but you, you should be free
377720	383560	not to read Husserl if you don't want to. I mean some of his close students chose
383880	396520	not. And you, you're, everybody, you know, it's a free life. But you can't say that, that Husserl
396520	404760	didn't play a role. I mean you don't get to do that. I remember one of my first professors was
404760	410600	Peter Berger, who wrote The Social Construction of Reality. And I was telling him I love phenomenology.
410600	415640	And he was saying, well how, how do you know phenomenology? I said, well partly your book,
415640	421320	and I read a bit of Schultz and a bit of Heidegger and Marvin Farber, because that's the guy who
421320	430920	brought phenomenology to America. And he said, yeah, he said everybody loves Heidegger, everybody loves
430920	437240	reading Merleau-Plenty, there's so, all the existential stuff people like. But the real me
437240	447320	is Husserl's phenomenology and nobody has the patience to read that. And so, so I, I, I took
447320	454360	that as a challenge. Right? Okay. And I ended up reading it all. So, so I felt I satisfied
455080	465080	one of my first teacher's efforts to, to, to teach me. Now I could have started this series of
465080	475800	lectures long ago with, with Husserl, if I was going to do it logically. But I started with the
475800	485480	juicy stuff, you know, because I, I wanted you to enjoy phenomenology. So we read Heidegger, we read
485480	494360	Merleau-Plenty, and we read Manheim and Schultz. And last, we're doing Husserl. But we're going to take
495080	510680	the order of his writings in the, in the toughest first, I guess. But, but I'll tell you, I, I, I
510760	518280	think Garfunkel is a person who's very difficult to read, but each reading creates something new.
521480	527080	And I think Husserl's the same way. I'm still discovering stuff in him. I mean, I love, one of
527080	534280	the reasons I like giving seminars on him is that, especially the one I did using the Spanish texts
534280	540120	in Buenos Aires, you know, in Spanish, I discovered, I never noticed that before. And I go back to the
540120	545480	English and sure it's there all along. But I think you know well after having read through this stuff,
545480	552440	it's possible for your eyes to slide across the page and not, and not capture things. But when
552440	557560	you're reading the foreign language, you're forced to go more slowly. So it's actually a good way to,
558440	565160	to get a fresh look on something you've already read. So I'm, I'm, I'm obviously excited about
565160	572440	Husserl, one of the, one of the few, right, which, which ought to drum me out of, out of any parties.
575640	581640	Okay, so let's, let's start. I hope we can finish. You ought to be able to ask lots of questions,
581640	585480	because I think questions are good when you don't understand. But I don't think we're going to be
585480	592600	able to do questions and get through this. So we'll have to choose at some point to get through or,
592600	601160	or to ask the question. The, let's start with logic investigations. The chapter three title
602040	610120	is, I mean, you see the page is 312, right? So if chapter three is at 312, you know you've been
610120	616280	in for a while. Actually, it's the introduction, which you ought to read, which takes out most of
616280	622280	those pages. The chapter title is called Fluctuation in Meaning and the Ideality of Unities of
622280	629720	Meaning. So we're looking at fluctuation and immunities of meaning, which ought to be,
629720	636360	on the face of it, a fascinating topic, right? And he talks about, if you read the first sentence
636360	644520	in our last chapter, we dealt with the act of meaning. Just to see meaning as an act is something
644520	650200	that, that is turning philosophy into a social science, because an act is something people do.
652280	661800	And that's what phenomenology looks at, is acts. Later in the paragraph, he talks about the shifting
661800	670200	acts of meanings. It's this flux of relations. How do these meanings shift? He can't talk about this
671320	677400	without looking at social phenomena, without looking at communication, because that's why
677400	683880	the meaning is shifting. It isn't shifting all by itself. I mean, I suppose you could have a study
683880	689960	of somebody whose meaning, understanding changes as they read through, but he is looking at social
689960	700120	things and understand he spent much of his life thinking about these issues in, in conjunction
700120	711400	with, with a fellow German-Jewish scholar and Garrick Simmel. And they corresponded and he
711400	717960	read his books, his Simmel's books. And I think you see the dialogue. A lot of this stuff, I think,
717960	723480	originates with some of Simmel's madness. At least there, there's the influence there.
724440	735080	So this, on, on, on the bottom of that paragraph, where he says five lines up, expressions whose
735080	742520	meaning shifts. It's just, this is a fascinating topic. It's, I wanted to teach my students this,
742520	749960	and I'm not going to teach students by reading Hustl, at least not sociology students who are
749960	755640	graduates and in some cases undergraduates. Actually, in this case, it was undergraduates,
755640	760840	because I decided I was going to teach them about expressions whose meaning shifts by having them
760840	768040	go out and study coffee tasting. And they went out and filmed people tasting coffee and looked at how
768040	774920	those descriptors changed their meaning over the course of the cup. Some of them were professionals
774920	780840	and some of them were, were lay consumers. And it was such a great topic, it became a major
781800	789560	research topic for me. It's great fun. I mean, there's nothing more fun in the world than
789560	796600	studying the shifting of sense. I mean, it really, it really, it makes you less absolute in your
796600	805400	personality and character. I mean, it makes you dance to the ironies of life. And so, so,
806760	813240	so he's got a good handhold. And the question then is, how do these shifting meanings become
813240	821880	communities of me? How do, how do we tame this, this amorphous beast so that we can get on with
821880	831720	things? And, and that's what he's studying. And that involves social work. When people create what
831720	839640	he calls objectivated forms, he says in the next section, 25, that there can be two kinds.
840280	849080	There can be kinds that have some intimations. Those in the third line of section 25 on 312.
849080	854840	Those that also intimate what they name. Intimate, he defines in the last section,
854840	863960	in the last sentence of this section, if we limit on 313. If we limit intimation in the
863960	869880	narrower sense to experiences which carry an expression's meaning. So, so there are some
870440	876680	expressions that you know what just what they mean. It's, it's sort of clear. But then there are also
876680	885880	those. He says, quote, in whose case named and intimated contents follow us under, that they,
885880	890600	they don't nobody knows what they mean. They don't even might not even know themselves what they mean.
891000	905000	And it's, it's, it's like an empty pallet or an empty shell that the name is there. There's an
905000	912280	objectivation. There's an expression. People are focusing on the expression. But it's like an empty
912280	926360	pallet. It still remains to determine its content. And so it's, it's, it's, you know, inherently a,
927320	934120	a social phenomenon because it presents local parties, we would call them members,
934760	940280	with the task of turning those objectivated forms into something that people can understand together
940360	947800	and can work with. And so that's a practical task that people face. And that's what Garfinkel
947800	956680	was up to all his life. There's no earlier, later. If you look on, on section 26,
959720	963960	he speaks of essentially occasional and objective expressions.
964520	977160	And he speaks in the middle of 314. Right after the question mark just above the middle on 314,
978040	986680	can we there still stick to self identical meaning unities? So meaning unities has to do with how
986680	995400	do we, how do we make these, these meanings unified? How do we produce unified meanings
995400	1000680	so that, so that it's clear what they mean and so that everybody's clear about what they mean?
1000680	1008280	That's what, what he means by objective. And, and of course, because he's doing phenomenology,
1008280	1013320	the how of that is much more interesting to him than the what.
1017480	1025320	It, the self identity, self identical means it, it keeps the meaning as,
1026680	1033880	as the event develops and even the next day, you have a meaning unity that remains the same,
1033880	1039400	but it doesn't remain the same all by itself. It remains the same because of the work
1039400	1047080	that the parties are doing to sustain that unity of sense. So we're interested in just how
1048120	1056920	that those members produce that unity of sense as a major task. It might be the
1057880	1069800	social activity synchrono. He speaks on 314 just below the middle. He's got two italicized
1070440	1077800	phrases. The first is, and I've written it up here, essentially subjective and occasional expressions.
1078360	1089080	And he defines that at the top of 315. He says, on the other hand, we call an expression essentially
1089080	1095160	subjective and occasional or more briefly, essentially occasional, if it belongs to a
1095160	1102200	conceptually unified group of possible meaning. In whose case, it is essential to orient actual
1102200	1111400	meaning to the occasion, the speaker and the situation. That's basically indexicality, right?
1112520	1121560	It's, it's, it's, it's meanings the way they happen in the real world. They have an indexical
1121560	1131320	character to them. But then he talks about objective expressions, the second term in italics.
1132920	1143960	And he defines that on 314 in that next paragraph. We shall call an expression objective if it
1143960	1151320	pins down, or can pin down, its meaning merely by its manifest auditory pattern, and can be
1151320	1157480	understood without necessarily directing one's attention to the person uttering it, or to the
1157480	1169160	circumstances of the utterance. This is basically a definition of objective. But you, you feel
1170120	1176920	Husserl's struggling in providing us with a definition of objective, because it's a very
1176920	1183000	tough thing. And that's what's kept me doing my coffee research. Everybody uses the term objective,
1183000	1191480	and everybody has a different idea. The way the term is used in society and in science varies
1191640	1199080	dramatically. What is objective? That's a radical question. It's an ethnomethodological question,
1199080	1209000	because it's what people are doing. And it's, it's, I mean, does what Husserl provides us here,
1210600	1215880	if it, if it pins down its meaning merely by its manifest auditory pattern, and can be understood
1215880	1220360	without necessarily directing one's attention to the person uttering it, does that exhaust the
1220360	1227320	meaning of objectivity? What more can there be? Objectivities don't happen on their own,
1227320	1234600	they involve practical work. And in an ethnomethodological way, I don't want to resolve,
1235400	1242040	I don't want us to, to solve the problem, answer the question, what more can objective mean,
1242040	1251080	by theorizing. I want to go out and watch people do it. And so Garfinkel did that. And
1253240	1259720	toward the end of his teaching, he came up with this, this model of interaction in which
1260840	1271000	the local work of accounting was, in fact, the practical work of people trying to continuously
1271080	1276920	upgrade these subjective and occasional expressions with objective expressions.
1278280	1286040	And, and you'll read in his writings, how, how they're always trying to get this substitution,
1288520	1293880	that, that is to substitute the objective expression for the occasional expression,
1293880	1297960	because it helps them organize the orderliness of their local affairs.
1298760	1304360	Now, Garfinkel also was very suspicious of that, and in suspicion, he, he,
1307560	1312760	I would say, cultivated during his reading of whistle's crisis, because that's the crisis of the
1312760	1320440	European sciences. In their concern with objectivity, they forgot to see. That is, they forgot that
1320440	1327480	there were these earlier moments of originality in which things were still in play, and that they,
1327480	1333000	in fact, substituted those occasional expressions for objective expressions. So they lost the
1333000	1342280	phenomenon. And so we, we are ever critical of objectivist, positivist strategies for losing
1342280	1351720	the phenomenon. But, I think we can go too far with that criticism, because you need some degree
1351720	1360840	of objectivation just to function. And I'm observing, witnessing, by going to the real world and
1360840	1368040	looking at coffee tasters doing objective work, I'm realizing that the objectivities that they
1368040	1376280	produce actually help them inquire into the flavors of coffee, that they'd be lost without
1376280	1385560	those objectivities. But that doesn't mean that, that they can just settle for the objectivities
1385560	1392520	and turn their minds off. They have to constantly realize that their, that those objectivities
1392520	1399320	are social productions. Because those objectivities, those reductions, those formulations, those
1399320	1408520	accounts will never exhaust the, the potential sense there is in worldly investigations, whether
1408520	1416040	you're a geologist or a coffee taster. So if you're going to be original and discover, as I've said
1416040	1421720	many times, what you need to know most, which is what it is you don't know, then you're going to
1421720	1428840	need to be open. And that openness comes from doing the phenomenological bracketing. That is,
1429320	1434680	understanding that these are production practices, that we are producing these objectivities and to
1434680	1443000	understand the nature of their reality. And we'll talk about that in a second when we move to ideas.
1445400	1449960	So this practical work consists of substituting the objective expressions for occasional
1449960	1456440	expressions and its work that's never finished. The world being what it is. And so a lot of
1456440	1463960	maintenance is required. And so ethomethodologists study this maintenance. This maintenance implies
1464600	1474040	that, as he says, at the end of that large paragraph at the top, first half of page 314,
1475880	1481640	that ends with a sentence. Obviously, we are here dealing with a case of unavoidable,
1481640	1487640	rather than chance ambiguity, no kidding, one that cannot be removed from our language,
1488200	1494200	one that cannot be removed from our life, he means to say, by an artificial device or convention.
1495000	1499880	That is, the indeterminacy is the nature. And of course, Merleau-Ponty picked up on this big time,
1499880	1508360	right? He wrote a lot about indeterminacy, which we, as members of the Enlightenment,
1508680	1516200	Euro-Americans, civilized people, want to limit the indeterminacies because we want
1516200	1521800	to be certain about everything. And we need certainty in order to believe our own propaganda.
1521800	1526040	And it's a lot easier to proceed in our affairs when we believe our own propaganda. But these
1526040	1534920	indeterminacies are very difficult, obviously, who so informs us. So I would say, as an aside,
1535000	1539320	there are two kinds of people, some people who get disturbed at these indeterminacies,
1539320	1543560	when the organized meaning falls apart, and those who get delighted by it,
1544600	1553080	when it falls apart. We're the second kind. If you're disturbed when the meaning falls apart,
1553080	1562840	and there's some researchers in our EMCA field who do get disturbed by that, although most don't,
1563800	1574520	but there's some to do, then probably you should find some other meaningful academic or
1574520	1579960	non-academic employment, right? You might become an accountant or something. Of course,
1579960	1586600	do they probably know better the indeterminacies? Well, look at your text book, Indeterminacies.
1587480	1591640	What's that? Look at your text book, Indeterminacies. I mean,
1591640	1597880	there are a lot of indeterminacies even in the context. Oh, yeah, exactly. Yeah, the text is that.
1600200	1605160	Actually, there's probably a third kind. Okay, so there's people who get disturbed by
1605160	1611880	indeterminacies, people who celebrate and dance, everyone they discover. And I urge you to be that
1611880	1619240	kind. But there's also a third kind, which is people either capitalists or politicians who seek
1619240	1625720	to profit by each situation that comes apart. I imagine people like Napoleon were brilliant at
1625720	1638760	that. But anyway, we're gonna have time for jokes. So, he says again at the bottom, six lines from
1638760	1644440	the bottom of 314, that objectivity depends on the tenor of the talk already in progress.
1645880	1653720	And the tendencies, it arouses. The tendencies talk arouses. My goodness, that seems social
1653720	1663320	studying talk. Way back in 1899. I mean, that's really remarkable. Anyway, in these situations,
1663320	1671640	we're very interested in learning just how expressions become objective. And across the page
1671640	1682760	in the last phrase of that first paragraph on 315, he speaks about these expressions sometimes
1683560	1688920	as having generally graspable, sufficiently reliable clues to guide the here to the meaning
1689000	1696520	intended in the case in question. Okay? I mean, he's, you know, understand that he and Simmel
1696520	1701880	didn't have tape recorders. That's the best that they could write. If you're gonna study talk,
1702840	1710120	you know, sufficiently reliable clues to guide the here, right? But if he had transcripts and he
1710120	1715880	had the tools that we had, I mean, I think he would have probably even done more work in this.
1715880	1722280	Anyway, we're doing the work. So we ought to be happy. But it's not like Huschel's way over there,
1722920	1731240	disconnected, in my view. Okay. And the next section, that's section 38.
1733960	1745480	He's speaking about objectifying acts and noema. And don't be confused by noema. Noasis
1745480	1755720	is the live thinking of your mind. Noema are products of that thinking, the transitory shifting
1756360	1765240	objectivation of those thinking. That is in this diagram that I put up. If we're, if we're thinking,
1766200	1774600	and I mean, a, a positive would say, okay, we just, we just see the facts and we're just
1774600	1782680	representing what we see. But a phenomenologist realizes that in fact, we are projecting
1784280	1792520	the sense on the object. We're seeing something in the light of our interests. So we're formulating
1793000	1805560	it. And this, this, this, it's not strictly conceptual, but this is the noema. The, the,
1805560	1813480	the framework through which our thinking passes that helps us, like coffee descriptors, to coordinate
1814200	1821480	our deeper and ever deepening understanding of the object that we're investigating.
1822280	1830120	So noema is, is, is this, it's like, it's like an account. It's like a term or it can be something
1830120	1837320	less than that. He says that the function of objectivated noema is to hold and preserve
1838040	1845080	or to present, that's a term he gets from Bentano, who was his teacher, right?
1850280	1861960	To present formulated thoughts. And on page 130, on page 639, right, we're, we're moving a lot
1861960	1871720	quickly in this. He speaks of the widest concept that the term presentation can stand for. And he
1871720	1879720	names this objectivating acts. And this term presentation is given a recent reflection by,
1880280	1887720	by Gunter Fegall, who is professor of philosophy at Freiburg in his recent book, Objectivity.
1887720	1892200	And you might want to have a look at his chapter on presentation.
1896600	1904760	He speaks about single-rate acts in, in this section and many-rate acts. And single-rate acts
1904760	1913640	are, are things, when I just see one, one item like a chair, but let's say, you know, I've got,
1914440	1922760	I've got a dozen different things I have to pack in my car. Some squares, some round, some long,
1923320	1934360	some with, with, with legs that don't unscrew off. And it's a many-rate act that I'm engaging in.
1935320	1945800	And in terms of ideas, we have lots of dimensions of ideas. The taste of coffee has many dimensions,
1945800	1952040	and I'm moving in many directions at once, but I'll capture it all under a general term,
1952040	1965880	like oily seeds or something, or roundness. And there's a tendency then, just for the purpose
1965880	1975400	of being able to function, for us to turn those many-rate acts into unities, into, into, first
1975480	1983720	unities retaining the many-rays, but ideally with a single-rate, because the many-rate unities are
1983720	1990680	very unstable and are difficult to work with interactionally. And so these are turned into
1990680	1999640	what he calls monothetic acts. In fact, many-rate acts are synthesized and objectivated to help
2000600	2008760	a, a local cooperative group function successfully. If you look on the bottom of 639,
2011080	2018520	it is true, but it is true. That's four lines from the bottom on page 369 of investigation,
2018520	2024520	five of logical investigations. It is true of the conjunctive or better collective synthesis,
2025240	2031960	as it is true of the predictive synthesis, that it permits a nominalization, in which case the
2031960	2040520	collective object constituted by the synthesis becomes the simply presented object of a new
2040520	2047800	single-rate act, and so is made objective in the present sense of the word. So you get all this
2047800	2058120	work and social work to condense the indexical meanings in a single term that maybe, maybe the
2058120	2065240	coffee tasters are using. It might still be somewhat indeterminate, but it carries enough
2065240	2076280	of these many-rate senses that the single term can be used in writing it down on a form
2076280	2085800	so that it can be passed on to the roaster, so the roaster knows what flavor he's aiming at,
2085800	2091720	or to the buyer, so he knows what kind of beans to buy. But the question is, and we're going to
2091720	2100200	see this when we get to the passages in the crisis that Whistle offers us, the does, the
2100200	2105640	objective form gets passed to the roaster, but does the meanings, do the meanings get passed?
2105640	2111720	This is the problem of every religion, right? You have these great guys with long beards
2111720	2117240	having these wonderful insights, and they develop these liturgies and write these books,
2117800	2131080	Bibles even, commentaries that get transmitted. I mean, we just had Passover last week. I mean,
2131080	2137480	you have a whole written procedure. You say this, you eat this, you say that, you eat that,
2137480	2144840	you're supposed to remember slavery, and it's just a social occasion. It's so shallow. It's
2144840	2150440	embarrassing. Most Passover, most Seder dinners I go to, I'm embarrassed for my own people,
2150440	2156760	because it's so superficial, because it's such a profound radical revolutionary political experience
2156840	2163560	in its origin. So how do you get back to that original sense? How do you re-vivify with Durkheim's
2163560	2171160	term, the form that gets passed down? So we're committed to this. We don't live forever. So we
2171160	2177800	have to institutionalize our ideas, and we have to simplify the ideas or they won't successfully get
2177800	2183560	passed down. So we turn these many rays into single rays. We turn these several accounts
2183560	2188600	into a single summary account, and you go on any tape that you make, and you'll hear the accounts,
2188600	2198840	and you'll hear a gradually economizing account, so that one terms will stand for everything that
2198840	2203480	people have thought through and experienced while they're tasting the coffee or whatever they're
2203480	2210760	doing. And how does that term retain that sense? That's the question that Hussal asked in reference
2210760	2217720	to geometry in the crisis and in the origin of geometry, and we'll come to that after the break.
2220280	2226920	So okay, so I mean it's difficult stuff, but it's real stuff. It's real stuff because we're
2226920	2234760	studying accounts. We're studying how people do that coordination of meaning. But of course,
2234760	2241480	do itself is a problematic word. Do is a relic of the Enlightenment. It's a relic of the great
2241480	2249400	age of the rationalist Cartesian subject who's in charge of everything. We're clueless most of the
2249400	2256360	time. There's no such animal as that. So we're not doing things as things are being done to us. We're
2256360	2265000	in the midst of these activities, the flux of what some are called reciprocal stimulations
2265000	2270920	of meanings, or just moving, and we're finding a way to work with them as they're passing us by.
2270920	2279240	We're not like master builders the way it's easy to write provided you don't have to leave your
2279240	2285160	study. If you go out and study and find people in the real world, you realize, oh my god,
2285160	2293080	here's a collection of 35 of the world's best whatever nuclear scientists, astronomers,
2293080	2301160	and they're not sure what they're doing either, right? I mean it's amazing. So we talk about
2301160	2308120	doing and we talk about production practices, but there needs to be as much passivity as activity.
2308840	2313320	And Herschel came to realize this too, but those books have only just been translated
2313320	2322600	in a new volume, or now not so new, about 10 years ago. Anthony Steinbach translated Herschel's
2322600	2333720	text on passive synthesis, which I think, I mean Herschel lived 100 years ago without video
2333800	2340440	recorders. So it's pretty amazing when you come up. Okay, let's move on to ideas.
2344520	2349960	Ideas is probably a decent place to start. It's a good book to carry with you. If you get a paper
2349960	2356200	back, it's like one of these books that you don't need to bring many other books. So it's
2356200	2366360	light to travel with. It's good for backpacking. If you look on 113, this is in section 50
2368440	2378680	of ideas, the fourth line on page 113, just there's a reference to the German text 94 at the top
2378680	2388440	right of that page. It should be the next page right after the logical investigations.
2389240	2400200	Yes.
2406680	2408440	Well, I'll go and read it. Yes.
2410200	2415880	Reality is not in itself something absolute, which becomes tied secondarily to something else.
2416600	2419160	Rather than the absolute sense, it is nothing at all.
2420920	2427800	It has no absolute essence, whatever. It has the essentiality of something which of necessity
2427800	2433000	is only intentional. My intention was Brent Thomas term, Brent Thomas being Herschel's teacher.
2433880	2440760	Only an object of consciousness, something presented in the manner peculiar to consciousness,
2440760	2448040	something apparent as apparent. So this is a very radical statement. Reality basically
2448680	2462440	is not what we think it is. If we think that reality is this object after we've erased all of that,
2463400	2473000	standing in itself, then that doesn't exist. There are trees, but there are trees that are part
2473560	2481480	of a process in which I am intending, this line is the line of intentionality,
2482200	2492120	that I persist. In another way of saying that there are no facts, they're only interpretations.
2494520	2498280	Or all facts are interpreted, that might be another way of saying it.
2500840	2504760	Why does reality lack self-sufficiency in terms of its essence? Because
2504760	2509720	its being depends on our understanding. Its essentiality is only intentional,
2510680	2517480	which means it is only an object of consciousness, like society. Who would argue society exists?
2518680	2527960	It's not there. It's an ideal notion, or your identity. Who am I? I'm a candlestick maker.
2529640	2536840	I'm an Indian chief. All these are constructions that don't really exist.
2537240	2544760	That doesn't mean they have no function. They have a kind of existence.
2546760	2555720	Now, he refers in 113 to living naively and experiences like really believing
2556280	2563720	in the independent reality. Like, I really am a movie star. I'm hot, can't you tell?
2564680	2571880	And so you have Judy Garland committing suicide, because it turns out she was not so hot.
2573720	2577800	As when her fault, the world led her to believe she was that hot. She was too young
2577800	2580920	to work it out. It happens to a lot of childhood actors.
2581640	2594920	So if you realize this lack of independent, that this reality is not the truth of our being,
2596360	2604120	there'll be some measure of safety, maybe. But you still need to use these things.
2604120	2609080	I mean, there's a sense in which this coffee does have a round flavor, or have woody flavor.
2609880	2615720	But the woodyness is your invention. It's not the coffee itself. And so you need to
2615720	2623480	proceed. You need to learn how to proceed with those objectivated notions that help you understand
2623480	2630360	the coffee better, but you can't be limited by your use of those objectivated notions.
2630360	2634040	So how do you use those notions? How do you use those objectivities?
2634680	2642760	In a wise way would be a way I would say. And so he develops a phenomenological reduction,
2642760	2648040	this practice of putting out of action our positings. And if you look on 114,
2653720	2660200	in the middle of the page, after the IE, just above the 95,
2660920	2664840	reference to the German edition, page 114 of the English,
2666120	2674360	we parenthesize the positings affected. For our new inquiries, we do not participate in these
2674360	2685000	positings. Instead of living in them, instead of affecting them, we affect acts of reflection
2685720	2693640	directed to them. So instead of living in them, instead of taking them seriously,
2693640	2701560	instead of believing your propaganda, you look at how they got to be what they were. And that
2701560	2709640	will open you up to the whole historicality of how they got to be made. And it will open you up,
2709640	2718680	hopefully you can go back far enough to find how they got to be made and get the horizon of
2718680	2724840	original experience that you had at that moment. It's like if you're following a map and you get
2724840	2732920	lost and the map, the unity of sense of the map falls asunder because it doesn't, the place you
2732920	2739560	found doesn't correspond with how you interpreted the dots on the map. You go back to the
2739560	2744920	point where you were really sure, where you really had the map in hand, and then you start out again,
2744920	2752680	because you can't just capture the meaning of the map at that point. You need to capture the
2753320	2759960	horizon of meaning, this futural anticipation of what's coming next. You have to go back and capture
2759960	2766360	it at a point where you knew where it was. So it's kind of like archaeology, I suppose,
2766600	2775320	archaeology of consciousness. I think Foucault already did that, but anyway. So by positing,
2775320	2783560	he's merely talking about this arrow. But what we're talking about here is there's an arrow in
2783560	2795160	which, it's really the arrows going in both directions. You have the landscape is transformed
2795160	2803960	by the way we posit it, and that landscape feeds back to us and gives us a new perspective from
2803960	2814680	which to posit further. So there's a circular, I suppose, process of understanding. In any case,
2814680	2820760	what's interesting for us is not just how this happens with one person, but how people together
2820760	2828920	do this. But in both cases, we keep our minds trained on what he's calling here a sense bestowing
2828920	2837160	consciousness. And so the first definition of phenomenology would be the study of
2838920	2847720	sense bestowing consciousness, or he says in the last line of this section 50 in the middle of the
2847720	2854920	page on page 114, the infinite field of absolute mental processes, the fundamental field of
2854920	2860920	phenomenology. Now that fundamental field of phenomenology is italics. It makes you even more
2860920	2866440	determined to figure out what on earth is he talking about by infinite and absolute. I mean,
2866440	2874200	it's not apparent. Absolute here simply means strictly. It's like just looking at the thinking
2874200	2883400	part by itself. Sometimes he uses the word pure. Just looking at what is the mind doing,
2884840	2889640	regardless of what's really out there. I mean, even if you're hallucinating,
2889640	2895480	is there an hallucination? Let's capture if it's really happening in your mind, then it's real enough
2895480	2903720	for us to capture. So that's the absolute mental processes and infinite because there's so much
2904040	2910840	we don't have enough paper to write the field notes for all of that the people are doing. So we
2910840	2917400	have to be selective. And of course, Garfield's advice is select those aspects that are most
2917400	2924600	identifying of the work they're doing. Anyway, the second definition of phenomenology is it's the
2924600	2932120	study of the imminent structures of consciousness, right? That is the stuff that's going on.
2932840	2937800	Imminent means really close up. There's two words in English. I don't know how it comes out in
2937800	2948120	Danish, but imminent and imminent, imminent is spatial and imminent is temporal. And we're talking
2948120	2956360	about the spatial. Heidegger's phrase was proximally and for the most part. That means
2956360	2964920	proximally means really in your face. Okay, let's move on to 55.
2972760	2979560	And he says in the second line in italics, all real unities are unities of sense.
2980280	2987160	That is, society isn't real. My identity isn't real. Well, it is real, but that
2987160	2993000	real unity is a unity of sense. That is, it's related to the sense bestowing consciousness.
2994040	3005240	He says, you see on line two and three of 129, the phrase sense bestowing consciousness. And then
3005240	3012520	a few lines down in the italics again, he says in absolute line eight, maybe nine,
3013080	3023160	an absolute reality is just as valid as around square. Reality and world are names here precisely
3023160	3032760	for certain valid unities of sense. And he doesn't hear mean any subjectivism. These things are
3032760	3039960	really happening. You really do think these things. So there's no subjectivism involved.
3039960	3050520	There's no real idealism involved. In Garfinkel's book, the seeing sociologically that was based on
3050520	3059400	his dissertation, he talks about the sterilities of subjectivism. He was very clear at the outset,
3059400	3066600	he's not into subjectivism, which is why he got a little upset when everybody first reviewed
3066600	3071960	ethnomathology as being subjectivist, because he was opposed to that from the get go.
3073320	3079720	That is, the phenomenological reduction excludes the naive natural attitude that believes its own
3079720	3086680	propaganda. So it's just rejecting the bullshit. I mean, it's not like that qualifies one for
3086680	3091080	being objective, just because you don't believe all the positive is propaganda doesn't make you
3091080	3098360	a subjectivist. That is, if facts are really interpreted facts, then thinking that their
3098360	3106600	facts all by themselves is to be biased. Even though it sounds like bias belongs with that
3106600	3114200	word interpretation, but the interpretation is really going on, then that's not subjective.
3114280	3121880	It's not idealism. Excluding the natural attitude means that we do not dream the
3121880	3130360	objectivations are severed from consciousness, or from the imminent, if we're going to talk more
3130360	3138840	like ethnomathologists, those objectivations, those accounts, those formulations, those organizing
3138840	3148200	ideas are never separated from the imminent, interactional processes that generate those local
3148200	3164760	structures. Okay, so let's go on to 87. The, uh, yeah, it's a couple pages later. Oh, it's page
3164840	3173640	211, but since it's, it says chapter three, now why, this is another, this is ideas, chapter three.
3181400	3187640	He talks here about, he's critical of one may have, it's towards seven lines, eight lines on the
3187640	3192760	bottom, one may of course use the word phenomenology, but one does not have the matter itself. He's
3192760	3198040	already upset midway in his career that people are saying phenomenology, this and phenomenology,
3198040	3204040	that, and don't have a clue what it is. Just as Harold was really upset about people talking about
3204040	3210760	ethnomathology, this and ethnomathology, that, and he wanted to stop using the word. He didn't
3210760	3216600	want to talk about it, the methodology, he wanted to engage in actual studies instead of talking
3216600	3224600	about engaging in actual studies. Uh, so the rigor is necessary, uh, if you don't have phenomenology
3224600	3234840	unless, unless you get to a kind of very austere analysis in which you're tough nose about not
3234840	3243000	accepting anything theoretical. He's not trying to be theoretical. It's more like the, the observations
3243000	3248920	of bird watchers. You know, he's, he's just not watching birds building nests. He's watching
3248920	3262280	human beings thinking. Uh, he says on the next page to 12, um, I'm not sure where, but, but he,
3262280	3270120	he talks about it, uh, unin, people, unencumbered, I mean, he talked about himself, unencumbered by
3270200	3278360	all current and learned theories, sort of satirizing, learned theories. We don't want a, a theory, uh,
3280920	3287400	um, he, you know, he says about, I don't know, a third the way up from the bottom. Rather than
3287400	3292280	living in the perception, adverted to the perceived and considering and theorizing,
3292280	3297320	they do not matter to direct the regard instead to the perceiving. That is, he wants,
3298120	3305000	he wants to not be distracted. He finds theorizing a distraction. So there's even, I would say,
3305720	3312520	a fraternity here with the ideological aspects of those phenomenologists
3313960	3321640	who tell me at any rate that they don't read Husserl because they think theory is a distraction
3321640	3325800	and Husserl is a theorist, so they don't read Husserl. And if they were to read Husserl, they
3325800	3332920	would get the advice from them that they shouldn't be theorizing things. Okay. Uh, and I think it's,
3332920	3338840	it sounded vice. And it doesn't mean that we can't over theorize with phenomenology. We just have to
3338840	3347880	be really disciplined and not do it. That's where the rigor is. Um, in, in the next section 102,
3348840	3356840	uh, it also covers objectivation. It discusses the nomadic object that is the object that functions
3356840	3367880	as a sign, a designation, a unity in the mental process. You see objectivation in italics on
3368360	3377880	249 and Garfinkel picks up that term, uh, and uses it from 1950 onwards. Um,
3381640	3390680	the, uh, it's this objectivation that is a nomadic core in Husserl's language that's, that's,
3391640	3399960	it's used by people to coordinate their thinking, to hold, remember I said, to preserve and present
3400760	3405880	the object that they found using that way of looking at it, to preserve it so that they
3405880	3415400	continue to experience it in that way. That nomadic core allows that not only allows us to
3415400	3422520	have that experience, but it allows us to share that experience, provided that we give a name to
3422520	3429640	it and indicate what's something about what's to be done with that name. So it's what allows a group
3429640	3439960	to proceed as a collective body. Okay. There's a very interesting passage in, in section 121,
3440760	3446440	uh, which is a couple of pages later, um,
3454920	3464920	that reveals that Husserl had an active scope, uh, of social phenomena, uh, in sight. Um, and I,
3464920	3473880	I'll read the passage to you on page 289, uh, under section 121. Um, and then we'll talk about
3475400	3485000	that's line five on 289. For example, the mother who looks lovingly upon her flock of children
3485320	3495400	embraces each child singly and altogether in one act of love. The unity of the collective
3495400	3501000	act of loving is not a loving and in addition, the collective objectivating, even if it is
3501000	3508120	attached to the loving as it's necessary foundation, loving instead is itself collective.
3509240	3514600	Now that's a very curious passage because it's an incredibly social kind of analysis.
3514600	3521400	It's one of those relatively few occasions in which Husserl specifically is examining a
3521400	3529880	collective activity rather than an activity of individual consciousness. And, and it shows that,
3529880	3536840	that, that he, it's not that he's completely ignorant of the social, uh, although given the
3536840	3543240	prejudice of his time, he always goes back to the classical philosophical Cartesian
3544440	3552200	individual consciousness, uh, which I think is a flaw, but, but he's fully aware. And I think to
3552200	3559880	some extent, uh, that motivated his interest in simile and simile taught him even more, uh, about
3560520	3568680	this interest, um, that this idea of collective objectivating, which I think I put up here,
3570520	3577960	is, uh, is, I think, I think the story, it's not, he finds this interesting, uh,
3579160	3585320	it's not something added on, it's like something foundational. So that's interesting. But
3586200	3591560	it's not foundational enough so that when Husserl, or when Husserlian philosophers
3591560	3599800	start doing their, their, uh, their formal phenomenological analyses that they provide
3600760	3609560	such an originary reading of the collective, uh, objectivation when they, when they analyze,
3609560	3613880	I mean, they basically reduce everything to the individual. I've had these arguments for years
3613880	3620440	in the phenomenology meetings, uh, that, that is its collective character is primordial.
3621880	3628680	People don't know what they're doing ahead of time and then negotiate meetings like,
3629240	3635800	like the social contract. That's mythology. Garfinkel would say that's a just so story.
3636360	3641240	Doesn't happen that way. They, people, and Heinegger already understands it and that's,
3641240	3647240	that's why Garfinkel read Heinegger. That's what got him excited because this phrase you get in
3647240	3657480	Heinegger, it's always already known. That always already implies that, that people don't start with
3657480	3664600	entabular rasa and then add it up due to some kind of phenomenological process of synthesizing
3664600	3670200	meanings and get to a deductive conclusion. Rather, Heinegger's talking about the always already
3670760	3676680	rethrown into the world, not of our own making with the solution in our hands and only at that
3676680	3683800	point do we start to make sense of what it is I've got. And that's, at that point, that's when
3683800	3688680	Garfinkel wants to be there. How does that sense making happen? How do we, how, what are those
3688680	3696600	achieve coherences? Right? I mean, it's, it's incredibly radical and, you know, uh, I remember
3696680	3702840	as a hobby saying, no, it's arguing with him about, about the originality of collectivity and no,
3702840	3707560	all that's in hustle. All you got to read more carefully. You got to read more carefully. And
3707560	3715880	he's right. But, but there's even more, I think, it's even more important than I think he appreciates.
3715880	3723240	Anyway, then he talks in this page, he goes on to talk about an emotional objectivity. Okay,
3723240	3729560	once you, once you start talking about an emotional objectivity, I can tell you all the
3729560	3735880	scientists in my university are going to check out, right? They punch their exit card on, on
3735880	3744840	emotional objectivity, right? But there are these, like, let's say there's a Bruce Springsteen song,
3744840	3751640	or just every Bruce Springsteen concert, for being sake, is an emotional objectivation, right?
3751640	3756360	I mean, wow. And it's a different experience because of its collective character. And if you
3756360	3761000	don't know anything about Bruce Springsteen and you come into it that way, it's only a collective
3761000	3771000	phenomenon and not an individual one. Uh, I mean, and you can hear really well that way. And so it,
3771000	3779480	if it's really going on, it's not subjectivist, it is objective. But then the question is,
3779480	3784680	and now we want to ask this question in the most radical way possible, how is it objective?
3785480	3790040	That is, how can this example shed light upon what it is to be objective?
3793560	3799880	It's, how does this emotion that gets objectivated as an object in the way of everyone to share
3799880	3808280	and to use for harmonizing their actions? It's, he speaks of the unity of a collective liking.
3808280	3814920	I mean, there's a lot going on. It's, I don't know anyone who's really commented much on this
3814920	3822120	passage. It's sort of buried deep in ideas. And, and not, he, I don't think he comes back to it.
3822120	3829080	My problem is, I don't read German. And there's more stuff that's in Husso's library in Belgium
3829720	3837720	than, than there is, this has been translated, right? I mean, so I can't really be a bonafide
3837720	3841800	Husso and scholar, but I don't read German, right? So everybody said, why haven't you read German?
3841800	3850040	I had my hands full, you know? I mean, anyway, and I don't have enough years to do that. But who knows?
3851080	3856600	Okay, move on to my favorite book, Formal and Transcendental Logic, and then we'll take a break
3856600	3865480	after, after we do this. Isn't it? Oh yeah, that's number two. That is, well, 16 and 17,
3865480	3872440	what, 116 and 170? That's just number two readings. We send it in two packages. Oh, did we? Okay.
3875800	3881080	Subsection F, the Categorial Formations. Every time I type Categorial,
3881080	3888360	Microsoft Word wants to do a spell check. They'll change it for me,
3889240	3892280	no. I mean, I like to turn everything they do off.
3895320	3901720	Habitual and intersubjective possessions, okay. Okay, here again, in this passage,
3901720	3906040	and I select it for that reason, from Formal Transcendental Logic, I should add,
3906600	3912360	I think it's Herschel's best book because more than any other book, he wrote it from beginning
3912360	3920360	to end as one coherent piece. All logical investigations, ideas are kind of like,
3921400	3929000	like Viconstinian notebooks, right, with, with topics that have organization for a large
3929000	3940280	range of pages, but the whole book isn't one particular piece. The, in fact, a lot of his work
3940280	3949400	now are his unpublished works. And then you never know how much the editor's doing, you know,
3949400	3960600	whether the editor's long grab, or many others. But here, this was his piece, and I think it's
3960600	3966120	a good one to read if you want to get into the real or so. Anyway, here in this passage, he talks
3966120	3976200	about a community of judges again, and judges in the plural, and of Categorial Objectivities
3976200	3985400	as constituted in the judgment community. So that's certainly a social phenomenon. We can talk about
3985400	3992040	a lot of things, but in the interest of time, I'm just going to stick with the most relevant.
3993720	3998920	And I find those in G, the objectivity given beforehand,
3999000	4008040	he identifies two kinds of objectivity here. He identifies the objectivity given beforehand,
4008840	4014120	and he contrasts that with the Categorial Objectivity produced by thinking.
4016120	4022520	So the category, the objectivity beforehand is like received ideas, like,
4023320	4033320	I don't know, I suppose, a prayer book for a particular ceremony, or a prayer,
4034120	4041800	or something that's handed down that everybody knows something about, and it's given beforehand.
4041800	4047400	But then there are those things that you yourself produce. He says the one given beforehand is the
4047400	4055160	pooled experience of a community that is on line six. And there's some very interesting
4055160	4064360	things about this discussion, but the social aspect should be clear. The sense of what's
4064360	4072200	handed down is really only evident when it's embodied in actual affairs, and he calls that
4072200	4080680	meaning fulfillment, or sense fulfillment, that you get this thing that's handed down,
4081720	4088680	and then this objectivity handed down, and then you get, you have to, well,
4088680	4094440	Durkheim's term was vivify, but they were writing at the same time, I suppose they read each other,
4095400	4105640	but he's talking about the, you have to make it come alive again in this sense fulfillment.
4111800	4118280	But, I mean, even though there's this division between these long-standing, maybe,
4119000	4124440	you know, they can be a thousand years, two thousand years, objectivities that get passed down
4125000	4132520	from generation, from one congregation to the next, but you still, they're still
4132520	4139160	categorically formed. I mean, categorical objectivity is categorical, obviously, because you're
4139160	4152520	making it and you're synthesizing a sense for it, but the, my mind's going 12 places,
4154920	4160520	they're both involved, categorical formations. There's no way that you can, there's no objectivity
4160520	4168360	that stands on its own. You always have to develop its horizon of sense and application,
4168440	4173800	but there is a distinction in terms of the pedigree of an objectivity and something
4173800	4179000	that's brand new. There are, like in the coffee business, there are forms that people use,
4179000	4187400	and there are respected forms that have been used for decades in thousands of international
4187400	4194600	top prize coffee tasting, and that has, you respect that form, or there are forms that you develop
4194600	4200200	just because you're not happy with that form for the, for the coffees that you have to,
4200200	4205240	maybe you're in Italy and the form's based on infusion, and you're doing espressos,
4205240	4213160	and you need a different form. The form that I saw at BKI coffee in Arroz two days ago,
4214280	4221160	it's a really fascinating form because it's briefer than most forms, and it's less
4221160	4228760	quantitative, though there are some quantitative indications on it, but they would be lost
4228760	4236920	without that form. They, they would be really, it allows them to make sure they remember to
4236920	4245480	look at all these aspects of the flavor, and, and it's oriented toward their practical needs
4245480	4255480	of finding defects and, and of making sure that the coffees they're buying are good enough for
4255480	4263640	the blends that they're, their intent on making, and, but then they can fill in the form, and they
4263640	4269400	then pass on the form to other people, and then they have to understand what that form means.
4270360	4278200	So what, the question again is what is objectivity? If you, you give it a number, the Italians are
4278200	4289320	very precise, it's an 80.5 just above the level you need to be certified, right? So it's objective,
4289400	4300760	right? But, you know, bless their souls, they know that, that it's not that objective, it's very
4300760	4308280	objective, but what is objective? And there's some odd things going on in that, you know, the coffee
4308280	4318120	was roasted a week ago, two weeks ago, so it's not going to have the flavor, if I'm going to judge it
4318120	4327320	fairly, maybe if it only gets a 79.5, it should qualify, you know. You have to use some wisdom
4327320	4334840	and, and judgment. Anyway, what I'm saying is that, is that the, the category of operations,
4334840	4342120	the, the need to resituate each form, I mean, I'm trying to get at what is objectivity.
4343000	4349480	Hustl's question is how do we make our experiencing itself and its productions a theme of judgment?
4349480	4355800	You're looking, you're not taking it for granted, you're not accepting the propaganda, oh it's 80.5,
4355800	4363080	it's on the best form by the best teachers, it's fact. You're looking at the process of judgment,
4363080	4368600	you're looking at the synthetic activities, the category of activities of a judgment community.
4368920	4375800	Now, Hustl uses a very important research strategy, and he talks about this on 119.
4376360	4385160	He says, on the, on the very top of 119, if we go on synthetically to make our experiencing itself
4385160	4390360	and its productions a theme of judgment, only then can we have original knowledge of the fact
4390360	4397000	that this harmoniously flowing experiencing already bears implicitly in itself before our thinking,
4397000	4401080	before our thinking, and the category of formations produced by our thinking, the
4401080	4407320	being sense of nature, as the same sense that thinking explicates, and he says,
4407320	4414920	all this too is anything but a piece of argumentative idealism. He doesn't want just
4416520	4421960	theory, it is obtained not from any speculating epistemology, right, he gets accused of being
4421960	4429080	epistemologist, or standpoint philosophy, that's static philosophy, that's the philosophy of
4429080	4436600	positivists, but from plain sense investigation and discovery. I mean, can you see how
4437240	4442760	this statement here is sympathetic with the motivating statement of ethnomethodology,
4443640	4451240	not standpoint philosophy, but plain sense investigation and discovery. So he wants to
4451240	4457480	go to the things themselves, and there's remarkable continuity between ideas and formal and transcendental
4457480	4465880	logic. So our studies are studies of sense investigation, but our studies also many times
4465880	4472440	have been too conceptual. And we need to pay, we need to learn how to pay more attention to the
4472440	4479320	eight conceptual phenomena by which the world gains its coherency. I know that's a theoretical
4479320	4486680	observation, but how do I not reduce everything, all coherencies, to the conceptual? I mean,
4486760	4497080	we need to find research domains which are tough to turn into concepts. And it's hard to study
4497080	4503400	that because these eight conceptual coherencies are invisible. I mean, it's hard to know, I'm
4503400	4510760	studying these surfers, and you know, I can't know for sure, three times out of four, and I'm a surfer,
4511320	4518840	and they're all taken for granted, right? I mean, Garfinkle says that in many places.
4519960	4530360	And so they kind of like slip in under one's gaze as a sort of of course phenomenon. So to turn
4530360	4538280	those into perspicuous cases is the task. And that's why, you know, Garfinkle went to the inverting
4538280	4545640	lenses and the pedestrian crossings and the freeway traffic, things like that. So here's another
4545640	4551160	definition for ethnomethology. We're studying the taken for granted coherencies that provide the
4551160	4561080	foundation of ordinary sense. The taken for granted, you know, these Gestalt coherencies
4561960	4572520	to use Barrett's face. Okay, should we, yeah, let's just finish the pharmacotranscendental
4572520	4586360	logic and then we'll come back and do the crisis. On the next section on 125, I think that's Greek
4586360	4594920	C, that looks like a Y, the scientist attitude. We have more discussion of
4594920	4603320	categorical objectivities, and they don't exist before our thinking. And yet, as soon as we think
4603320	4610760	them, they seem to be existing by themselves just as soon as we come up with them. I mean,
4611640	4622920	just as soon as gets a hope, we would say just as soon as they clean up the data and they find the
4622920	4628840	star, the star is all there by itself, right? It's no longer dependent on the data. I mean,
4628840	4637720	it just happens instantly. So in what sense, if Husserl is right, if Husserl
4641800	4652520	is correct about them being always categorically formed, always synthesized, then in what sense
4652600	4659000	can they be objective? Can they be objective? What do we mean by objective if they are partly
4659000	4665880	our production? Well, to some sense, there's a tangibility to that objective. A tangibility
4665880	4676840	as an object, as in taste descriptors, you know, have a tangibility to them. The Noema,
4677720	4684440	what allows them to retain the idea is that they have this objectivity to them. They have this
4684440	4693240	tangibility to them. The intention aimed at cognition passes clear through these Noema. He
4693240	4700520	tells us on 125. You can't think without them. And they're even more important in social affairs.
4700520	4705400	They're not just important for our own thinking the way classical phenomenology would think it,
4705400	4713400	but they're important in social affairs. And in fact, but there's an added problem. Once a
4713400	4721880	categorical objectivity is given a name and that nominal form is appreciated and confirmed by
4721880	4730200	everybody, it all of a sudden gains a moral value. And that moral value tweaks everything.
4730200	4736200	And really, it's hard to see clearly after the expectation that this is the truth
4737880	4746200	starts being laid upon us. But that's a separate topic. He actually does talk a little about that,
4746200	4753880	but we're not going. But he says on this page, these conditional acquisitions are abiding
4753880	4759960	and accessible to everyone. Okay, that's the important thing. And he says every scientific
4759960	4765240	statement has this sense from the start. It's already addressed to this everyone.
4768360	4773000	So this is social and expresses Herschel's interest in communication as well.
4774520	4779880	I think Herschel is implying that the process of constructing these ideal objectivities
4779880	4789720	is the same for the scientist as it is for the everyday judge, as he calls it. But that leads
4789720	4794360	us to the question is, so what then is the difference between scientific objectivity
4794360	4801960	and objectivity for the everyday judges? He answers that by saying that the difference is that the
4801960	4810200	scientist is more inclined, more habituated in his terms, to reexamining his or her objectivities
4811080	4820360	than our ordinary persons who are less likely to question themselves and less likely to reexamine
4820360	4826760	things. If you look at the bottom of 124, four lines from the bottom, not that the scientist
4826760	4833240	does not judge at all before having such a having of the affairs themselves, the objectivities
4833240	4838840	themselves that belong to this particular category level. But he takes all prior judgments as only
4838840	4845400	provisional. The categorical objectivities accepted in them as only provisionally accepted
4845400	4851480	as merely supposed objectivities. So there's a willingness to surrender
4851800	4860280	what's become habitual among scientists, a greater willingness to surrender your affiliation
4860840	4866280	compared with people in everyday life. Now Schultz added another one in his writings
4866280	4872120	in terms of the difference between common sense thinkers and scientific thinkers. He says that
4872120	4879320	the scientists systematically expose their thinking to criticism of other people. That's not
4879320	4884440	that they're thinking any differently. I mean he agrees with Schultz to that extent that they're
4884440	4891800	using the same processes but they're more open to this kind of negative criticism and that's
4891800	4897720	part of the process. You know what they say isn't true but you have peer review and you have a
4897720	4902840	consensus and debate and dialectics and at the end of that you have something you don't have in
4902840	4909160	everyday life. But the structuring of the prejudgements is similar. You might try to
4909160	4917080	employ this taking as only provisional, this endless suspicion of yourself as a constant practice.
4919880	4925800	And if you do, it's for sure you won't be invited to the parties that they have at the
4925800	4933000	university. You know those sociologists. I mean we're constantly questioning authority. We have
4933000	4939800	a bumper sticker in Eugene, question authority. Everybody likes to put that in their car, question
4939800	4947240	authority. But the people who put that in their car are questioning other people's authority.
4947240	4953720	Schultz was talking about questioning your own authority. That's really more helpful.
4954040	4959480	And that's the good coffee. That's why I love the coffee thing. They do that a lot because they have
4959480	4967720	to do that because their cards, their descriptors are hemming them in at every stage while every cup
4967720	4974520	of coffee they taste is breaking them out causing them to move through them and transcend them.
4975320	4984600	So the crisis in science that Husserl speaks of is when scientists fail to live up to this constant
4984600	4993160	self-criticism or what Husserl calls in this text radical self-understanding. Radical self-understanding
4994360	5001640	it's a great notion and I think even a great term. Radical self-understanding
5002200	5012040	is understanding that is bifocal. It's looking at the object and trying to nail down you know
5013000	5021000	what geological formation is. But as it's doing, as Hoppe demonstrated to us the
5021000	5030760	astronomers have to do as part of their trade, you have to look at yourself looking.
5030760	5037080	You have to have this reflexive gaze. You have to see yourself seeing. Radical self-understanding
5037080	5042360	is understanding that it's understanding while it's always re-examining its roots.
5043480	5048840	So you're constantly in Husserlian terms which is very criticized by the postmodernist
5048840	5055960	purifying your consciousness meaning that you're you're fessing up to your biases. You're realizing
5055960	5064040	that this coffee is round because you're using the term round. So you're trying to constantly
5065720	5073720	check up on yourself to make sure that you're not eating yourself down a rosy trail.
5076120	5082760	And then he says this is a peculiar judging procedure in 125. He's right in the middle of
5082760	5089800	the page in 125. This brings about a peculiar judging procedure on the scientist part in italics.
5089800	5096760	A zigzag judging. Okay that is that is you're going to the object and then you're going to the
5096760	5100920	mind and then you're going back to the object and you're going to the mind. First making
5100920	5105880	straight for the giveness of something itself but then going back critically to the provisional
5105880	5114520	results already obtained whereupon his criticism must also be subjected to criticism. So it's almost
5114520	5125000	an endless criticism of the critique of of the acceptance and you know that is an endless
5125000	5130440	regress and how you go at the end of his life wrote some very cogent articles on that but
5130520	5138600	but you have to you have to do that we can't do any better that's that's the cards that have been
5138600	5149080	given to us. Note also on this page Heschel's profound realization of the limits of science.
5149080	5156840	He says at the end of that same paragraph in parentheses when he talks about true getting
5156840	5163320	the true being he says an idea incidentally the sense and limits of which are not matters for
5163320	5175080	positive science itself to explore that is the the whole process of this criticism and radical
5175080	5184840	self-understanding positive science hasn't really appreciated and maybe it's not even in its in its
5185480	5194280	bag of responsibilities although it should be the crisis is that they don't so he he defines
5197800	5203880	science as cognizing that accepts no judgments as scientific except those that have shown their
5203880	5211720	correctness and that's that's I think a very important thing where does truth originate
5212280	5222200	does it originate in method or does it originate in what Heschel called evidence in German which
5222200	5228920	means immediate insight in this correctness that he puts in quotes because it's hard to put a word
5229960	5235640	but I know something is true because I have that experience I taste that roundness and that roundness
5235640	5242680	is so true that that's where I start that's that and if anybody says something else I'll deny
5242680	5247720	you know I mean like my experience in my life is there's no such thing as reincarnation
5249560	5254360	and so I'm living with all these people who presume I believe in it and I and I get into a lot
5254360	5261800	of trouble and even satirized by my teachers for being cynical about it but I'm not about to believe
5261800	5268440	anything that I don't know is certain right so that's that's the kind of faith that that Heschel
5268440	5281480	is calling science and it's uh it's uh you know it's it's it's an important way way to work okay
5282200	5291080	so we'll we'll take a break and we'll come back and do the the crisis of the European Sciences
5294600	5304200	okay we're gonna pick up with what I believe is the the most beautiful passage of phenomenological
5304200	5307640	prose ever written so beautiful I felt that too
5310840	5319240	which passage one I would even call it poetry uh it's on page 56
5321720	5330040	under K the section is fundamental significance of the problem of the origin of mathematical
5330040	5335960	natural science okay it's uh starts on line five the second sentence
5349080	5354840	well that's important it's it's kind I it's so beautiful I want you to come in right when it
5354840	5362120	can grab you it's like when you're when you're studying a tape uh one of the great thing about
5362120	5368120	the digitizing of the tapes is you can bounce right on the exact start of the data that you're
5368120	5374600	looking for if you have in the old days when you had to rewind oh I remember there was something
5374600	5380040	great that he just said that relates to this after you spent 10 minutes looking for it and then
5380040	5386200	losing your place whether you're before it or after it the enthusiasm of your mind is gone
5386200	5393720	and so you can't attend to it so I want it's so good I want your enthusiasm to be to be eager
5393720	5403480	and ready okay fifth line the developed method the developed method the progressive fulfillment
5403480	5414440	of the task is as method and art which is handed down but its true meaning is not necessarily
5414440	5422440	handed down with it and it is precisely for this reason that a theoretical task and achievement
5422440	5429000	like that of a natural science or any science of the world which can master the infinity of
5429000	5435320	its subject matter only through infinities of method and can master the latter infinities only
5435320	5443400	by means of a technical thought and activity which are empty of meaning can only be and remain meaningful
5443400	5451560	in a true and original sense if the scientist has developed in himself the ability to inquire back
5452280	5460760	into the original meaning of all his meaning structures and methods that is into the historical
5460760	5468040	meaning of their primal establishment and especially into the meaning of all their inherited
5468040	5477000	meanings taken over unnoticed in this primal establishment as well as those taken over later
5477000	5492760	on okay that's just wonderful it's talking about the way that science proceeds by necessarily by
5492760	5500280	relying on method but how the method eventually becomes empty of meaning I mean I got him was
5500280	5507160	talking about that in truth and method you need the method but the method is not where truth lies
5507960	5513720	right it's not where the real objectivity is and you can't convince people in the coffee world
5514680	5520520	who've invested hundreds of thousands of dollars in these methods you can't convince them that
5520600	5530440	that's not where certainty and truth are and they're suspicious of of of something subjective but
5531560	5540120	okay using coffee tasting as an example if it involves your tongue it's got to be subjective
5540440	5550360	and so to pretend that it's not is to not be objective if there's a subjective component
5550360	5556920	in reaching the objectivity of the taste then you have to admit that subjective component
5556920	5563080	they get that a bk coffee that's why I was so enthused two days ago they understand that and
5563080	5568840	they're not denying that and they still develop their technique they still develop their method
5568840	5574920	because you have to have a method and the method becomes a technique and you master the infinity
5574920	5580520	of its subject matter all the flavors of coffee only through the infinities of method and you become
5580520	5589160	technically expertise at doing that but it can only remain meaningful if you inquire back into
5590920	5596920	how you develop those methods in the first place what were you finding what were you witnessing
5597720	5603800	I mean he's describing the fate of all objectivities here and the fate of all objectivities is to
5603800	5613240	become thinner and thinner in meaning to less and less of that original awareness certainly not
5613240	5620440	the horizon of meaning in which the the method was developed you know coffee tasters realized
5620440	5625720	they needed to keep track and it was good to keep track in this way and then you come up with
5625720	5634200	different ways some forms do it from one to ten some forms do it from they have a form a couple
5634200	5648600	of excellence where i'm going uh next week in El Salvador they do uh zero four six and eight
5648920	5659640	zero four six and eight it's not it's not equal and that that changes the results the uh the
5659640	5668680	specialty coffees of Italy they do one to seven so you get a lot of fours and fives okay hard to
5668680	5677720	get a lot of fours and fives on a form that's zero four six and eight right but anyway you develop
5677800	5683560	you develop your method for for whatever good reason that you have but you forget what the good
5683560	5689080	reason is and then you just do it by rote and when you do it by rote you're not going to do it as
5689080	5698760	well that's who shows notion he's saying that that the the the mathematical natural scientists
5698760	5706120	have to go back into the historical meanings and capture what did you inherit you know when you read
5706840	5715560	the the textbook in mathematics in in grammar school and high school and college uh what were
5715560	5724200	the inherited meanings and then what what were and a lot of those meanings you didn't even notice
5724200	5730360	you kind of like they were like subliminal and you maybe discovered them later even um
5731000	5737240	um and then there's things that you take over later on accretions as as mathematical science
5737240	5742600	develops as your career develops as you do your research here there in this other areas you pick
5742600	5753080	up things there's a there's a development and so part of the concern of phenomenology is to not
5753080	5763080	just take things as static but to go back and find the originary sense originary that's another word
5763080	5770920	that that microsoft will well not a lot right uh but it's a technical who's showing term and it's
5770920	5774840	a term that's very much under criticism and we won't go into that here but the postmodernists
5774840	5781160	say there's no such thing as original derrida says everything is derivative and he's right but
5781160	5786520	pusher only means there's a point at which you first put the idea together given a natural
5786520	5792120	experience that actual experience exists you can go back that far you know there's not they're not
5792120	5799480	original in the sense of that of a need so you want to keep aware then of the synthetic activities
5799480	5805960	of producing these unities of sense and not and not just accept the unities of sense as docile
5806840	5814680	cultural objects so again there's seeing and then then in categorically informed seeing is seeing
5814680	5823400	that that that captures the process of cat categorizing and synthesizing um i mean it seems
5823400	5829560	like it's impossible because there's no piercing seeing already involves all that
5830040	5836760	on of course i won't talk about this there's a kind of seeing in the Tibetan system that they say
5836760	5845240	is direct and unmediated but i think that's mythology but i'm not sure anyway i'm i'm
5845240	5850920	planning on investigating it in the next couple of years but it's part of this debate i'm not
5851000	5863080	forcing crucial onto them so uh he's acknowledging again here on page 56 the limits of positive
5863080	5869080	science when he says the mathematician the natural scientist at best a highly brilliant
5869080	5875720	technician of the method i mean that's a respectful put down right a highly brilliant
5875720	5880600	technician of the method and hushall was a mathematician i mean he had no reason to dislike
5880600	5890040	mathematicians but he wanted to basically find to ground truth and certainties as a mathematician
5890760	5897960	and he wasn't able to do it and it fascinated him so he began to become a philosopher to explore
5898680	5907640	why that wasn't possible i'm 57 uh in the middle of that paragraph that's over there
5908200	5914680	he says every attempt to lead the scientist to such reflections if it comes from a mathematical
5914680	5920600	non scientific circle of scholars is rejected as metaphysical okay this is what we would call
5920600	5930120	an australia a winch he's winching he's complaining that that that oh this criticism is is is
5930120	5937480	uh we're not doing metaphysics that they put down people doing that and it's going on this very
5937480	5945880	minute as i speak there's a movement at the university of fryberg to remove the chair
5945880	5952120	that hushall and heidegger occupy that gunty figal presently occupies they want to remove it and
5952120	5959160	replace it with an analytic philosopher and so the whole world is screaming and i don't know
5959160	5966440	what the politics are on that campus but it shows you that i mean i mean hushall was there at fryberg
5966440	5975560	when he was writing this sentence and uh things have only gotten worse right so uh it's it's not
5975560	5984360	like there's a happy ending yet well it's changing the academic style and uh power play it's pure
5985000	5990600	mega trend of analytic philosophers eradicating everybody else yeah they did that in holland
5990600	5996120	completely there's nobody doing anything non-agletical in language for example well there's
5996120	6002520	there's a hardy department there's the center for the study of subjectivity at the university of
6002520	6007880	Copenhagen yeah i talked about holland oh holland right sorry but i mean then certain areas i mean
6007880	6015400	we can see that they just burn and escape and they do in germany at the moment so and they will do it here
6015480	6024760	maybe and so his argument is that if positive scientists in no way inquired into the unexamined
6025320	6031080	taken for granted received method then then there won't be this difference between science and
6031640	6039000	and naive everyday practitioner i mean what distinguishes science is this capacity to
6039000	6044680	turn the gaze back on itself this is what science is uh
6047320	6056680	but it takes longer to do it stalls you you can't move forward as quickly okay let's let's uh
6057240	6059240	uh look at uh
6062760	6063400	i forget
6065400	6069400	okay
6069400	6074360	um on the next page um
6075240	6076040	um
6079240	6087560	which is 105 pages later um let's look at uh at 163 oh
6090840	6097240	he was a mathematician yeah one two seventeen sorry joke
6098200	6100120	um
6104120	6112120	here he says um let's see well i want to read a couple of sections here um
6114600	6118120	i just have to find them
6118920	6131240	okay uh let's start with the middle paragraph on 163 but instead of inquiring further in the sphere
6131240	6136280	of our own intuition so let's turn our attention to the fact that in our continuously flowing world
6136280	6144760	proceeding now that continuously is very big news right and he uses that continuously also at line
6144760	6153400	three of 164 that continuously is uh is the ongoing character of events it's the no time out
6154200	6162280	it's the uh the the floating crab game that garfinkel's talking about um that is you don't
6162280	6169880	want to reduce affairs to some kind of static sociology which is what most positive sociologists
6169880	6179640	do so uh in our continuously flowing world proceeding we are not isolated but rather have
6179640	6187320	within a contact with other human beings right it's a very frank uh attention to social phenomena
6188040	6195400	each one has his perceptions his presentations his harmonious experiences the valuation of
6195400	6202120	his certainties into mere possibilities right plenty of those doubts questions illusions
6202680	6207240	but in living with one another each one can take part in the life of the others
6208120	6213240	thus in general the world exists not only for isolated men but for the community of men
6213800	6219400	and this is due to the fact that even what is straightforwardly perceptual is communalized
6219400	6228760	in this communalization too there constantly occurs an alteration of validity through reciprocal
6228760	6235080	correction in reciprocal understanding and i think he gets this reciprocal from simul because
6235080	6244440	simul talked about uh reciprocal stimulation as the core interest of sociology uh looking at
6244440	6251400	the sociality uh in reciprocal understanding my experiences and experiential acquisitions
6251400	6259080	enter into contact with those of others so this this reciprocal correction reciprocal
6259080	6267800	understanding is a very general gloss but what is it a gloss for we still have to fully explore
6267800	6273880	this that's what we're doing i think in ethno methodology there's this kind of these meanings
6273880	6280280	these unities of meanings that are produced and stabilized fall apart in this reciprocal
6281000	6288200	so they're so we have to kind of correct them uh and the validity's get altered a little bit
6288200	6295400	and they get restabilized and so my hope is i can record enough coffee tasters to see how
6295400	6300040	they're stabilizing those unities of meaning when they come apart because the coffees are
6300040	6306840	going to throw them apart i mean coffees do i mean it was amazing two days ago there was one
6306840	6313240	coffee that was totally smooth i would say like like a base and then there was the next coffee
6313240	6320360	was like a tenor just singing high flavored fruity notes i mean there were like six coffees on the
6320360	6325880	table four completely different flavors you wouldn't you think they were different different
6326680	6334200	plants um so so there's always a point at which the categories are going to fall short
6335080	6341480	you can pin them in the categories but you want to preserve what is unique about that coffee that
6341480	6347080	you're thinking of paying big bucks for i mean one of them was a very expensive coffee that in fact
6347080	6352600	he loved it but he felt he wouldn't be able to afford it because they can't be putting
6352600	6359880	super expensive coffee because they produce so much of it that it's going to be super expensive to buy
6359880	6366920	that much right and and then once they put it in they have to commit to paying that for the long
6366920	6372360	run so they also have to think about what it's going to cost later in years to come or else
6372360	6378520	their clients will get pissed off being hooked on that flavor i mean that's a different seminar
6379160	6385000	but anyway but we're talking about reciprocal correction i mean they're trying to re-establish
6385560	6393480	the the efficacy and and vitality of these categorical uh unities that they're producing
6395160	6401400	and it's there's no time out i mean it's the world is always going to fall apart and come back
6401400	6406440	together and then later in that paragraph we won't read it all talking about intersubjective
6406440	6413880	harmony of validity and intersubjective unity so you get this intersubjectivity which you know okay
6414520	6419720	this i would say all of us ethnomethodologists garfinkel included we're thrilled with this
6419720	6423960	notion of intersubjectivity he had the anniversary of his life although he always talked about
6423960	6427960	intersubjectivity from the very beginning but he makes a bigger deal a bit later and we're all
6427960	6435320	interested but at the end we realize it's just a it's just a gloss that intersubjective kind of
6435320	6441000	like says everybody stands alone and then they come together but it's not like that they're together
6441000	6450440	first and so i i i'm i'm not happy with the with using the term intersubjective um but still
6451160	6459080	the phenomena the the real world experience that intersubjective unity is is an intersubjective
6459080	6465160	discrepancies is addressing those real world phenomena are what we're studying we just have to
6465160	6476360	find more appropriate uh ways of describing okay so so you get this this social term in uh in
6477240	6481960	the crisis of the european sciences which came at the end of his life and he couldn't avoid the
6481960	6488200	social because by that time he'd been kicked out of his job at fryberg because the nazis took over
6488200	6497080	and he was jewish and uh and you couldn't deny the social importance of social affairs and the
6497800	6504120	the origin of geometry took what wrote uh was was delivered i think in chakrasilakia
6505560	6515080	in prog um uh and uh i think it was maybe a year before he died two years before he died
6515960	6524120	when he was practically he couldn't go lecture in germany um and uh derrida wrote his
6524120	6529960	doctoral dissertation on the origin of geometry um and he's written a lot about it this is kind of
6529960	6537000	kind of interesting very clear derrida you don't get a lot of it that i mean derrida i i mean i i
6537000	6545720	like him very much but uh but his earlier material his book on on the origin of geometry is is one
6545720	6557960	of his clearest um the uh it's a it's a it's not a really long article and and garfinkel has a paper
6557960	6566840	on this in human studies i don't know 2005 maybe i'm not sure or yeah i maybe could be earlier
6567800	6574760	um and you know he recognized well that all scientific constructions are
6574760	6584920	products of the cultural world um and he asks mostly how these scientific products get to
6584920	6594280	be objective so he asks in a very radical way uh and you you see that uh in the bottom of 357
6594280	6603960	in the footnote okay um he says are more precisely in the line three four they have their objectivity
6603960	6613880	their existence for everyone uh so is that what objectivity is how they exist for everybody
6613880	6626120	in a kind of similar way um he says uh above the page about a third of the way down the sensible
6626120	6636040	utterances on 357 still have spatiotemporal individuation in the world like all corporeal
6636040	6643640	occurrences that he's talking about indexicality there indexical expressions have a corporeal
6643640	6650600	nature to them they're they're the the term the utterances the words are like bodies because they
6650600	6656680	have a sound uh they're they're tangible but tangible has to do with touch i don't know if
6656680	6664920	there's a similar word for sound but but they're there in the world and they can become a focal
6664920	6670840	point for a lot of times when you we do our studies this came out particularly when i was
6670840	6678440	looking at intercultural conversations uh there were many situations in which persons like chinese
6678440	6685000	visiting the us they knew that something was very important in the conversation a passage
6685000	6689720	they kept getting repeated with a certain energy but they didn't know what it meant but they knew
6689720	6694360	that that was the core of what they were supposed to understand so you know something without knowing
6694360	6704440	what it is so there's that corporeal nature and that provides then the focal point for the the
6704440	6720520	chinese and american participants in a conversation um so it's it's this observation i think
6721400	6729160	illustrates this process of objectivation that that this tangibility is produced by the objectivation
6729160	6735480	we need that in order so people can get on the same page even though they're not sure what's on
6735480	6743720	the page still the material facticity of a gloss or of an account or an utterance allows it to serve
6743720	6751320	as the vehicle for what gerbage calls in a fabulous phrase but in the end it's only a gloss that
6751320	6761160	doesn't yet mean enough intersubjective concatenation of meaning that is the the the way in which people
6761160	6772760	do this reciprocal uh correction this reciprocal interconcatenation uh the um which are all just
6772760	6782520	names but but you need some you need an object you need a place for people to come together you need
6783480	6787000	the corporeal character of the occurrence is what hostel's saying here
6788840	6797160	um i mean he gets really specific i think a little further down maybe it's in the main text not the
6797160	6805000	footnote it's three six nine lines from the bottom of the main larger text on page 357 he says
6805000	6813800	wherever something is asserted one can distinguish what is thematic that about which it is said
6814760	6818040	okay that about which it is said
6818040	6829000	uh but uh and sometimes that's all we have and i like to think of it as the an empty palette
6829000	6837880	that remains to be loaded and people will then start loading it uh like uh like like what is full
6837880	6847720	body what is medium body uh and people have the term they have this thematic object it's a gloss
6848200	6856360	for what garfinkel says it's a gloss for whatever comes to me he said the the uh he in his studies
6856360	6864120	of games with rules he says that that rules consist of their consequences right i mean that's not
6864120	6868520	how people i said the rules the rules of the rules they have to know what they are ahead of time
6868520	6874440	no it's not like that i mean it can be on rare occasions but it's not
6876840	6883160	so as social phenomenologists we want to track the local history of that production
6884600	6893080	and uh you know the the temporality that pushover wrote a lot about is in fact the temporality that
6893880	6900840	that we're trying to capture in our studies of of naturally occurring interaction
6902280	6905640	so he poses a fabulous question at the bottom of 357
6907320	6914200	how does geometrical ideality just like that of all sciences proceed from its primary
6914200	6921080	intrapersonal that is one person alone origin where it is a structure within the conscious space
6921080	6930520	of the first inventor's soul to its ideal objectivity ideal referring to the uh the
6931320	6938840	the self-identical meaning unity that is shared by everybody in the group uh so that's the way
6938840	6945640	hosso poses the question and you know for me the first inventor's soul is a step too far uh
6945720	6950200	i mean i don't know about souls and i don't know about lone inventors um
6951800	6960840	i want to reverse that and my argument which which i don't think i haven't convinced i haven't
6960840	6965800	gotten sahabi to listen to the argument yet uh because every time i make it he says yeah
6967800	6972760	but he doesn't know that if he's saying that if he's always asking how do we get from the
6972760	6979720	individual's inventor soul to to the inter subjective i want to know how do we get from
6979720	6987240	the inter subjective to the individual i'm reversing that um and i think we need to do a lot of that
6989240	6994760	um i mean it can be the story the way hosso phrases it it's possible to proceed from one
6994760	7000680	creative idea to its objectivation and so move from the subjective to the inter subjective
7000680	7005640	but i don't think that's usually how it happens i think it's only an ideal version and not the
7005640	7011800	real version uh because what we have is always already there uh and how did it get there how
7011800	7017480	does this receive stuff that we passively the whole passive synthesis of glycerol i think
7018040	7025800	i don't know enough i i have to spend a good year uh reading through those texts um that passive
7025800	7034280	synthesis is full of insight and then in the end maybe as a cop out i don't know uh uh but but i
7035000	7042760	i want to to look at more i mean with either way we do work now with with our attention to local
7042760	7049560	detail with the assistance of digital recordings i mean i think we can really discover these things
7049560	7056200	from the real world as hosso and garfinkel are both recommending uh and you could say oh yeah it's
7056200	7061640	both you know you know it can happen one way it can happen the other way uh or you could say
7061640	7065880	a lot is that oh yeah there's some kind of dialectics at work which is it's too vague
7065880	7072280	to be really helpful and usually when philosophers say it they're secretly keeping the subjective
7072280	7079480	this primary this cartesian subject somehow won't die um if there's going to be any original and
7079480	7090280	if not uh it would be what hosso is here calling the inner subject he says i'm one on three five
7090280	7097880	three fifty eight uh about two thirds of the way down a reciprocal getting along with others
7097880	7104840	okay i mean this that's that's i mean you couldn't say at the methodology is a study of the reciprocal
7104840	7114520	getting along with others i mean that's that would be adequate uh but maybe it doesn't approach the
7114520	7125400	radical character of what we've come upon um on the next page line three three fifty nine he says uh
7128520	7133560	in this sense civilization is for every man who's we horizon it is a community of those
7133560	7140840	who can reciprocally express themselves so this reciprocal which i'm maintaining he gets from
7140840	7148840	simil because uh it's in simil and he was reading simil's books and there's all these books by simil
7148840	7155560	well doggiered in uh was early in library in living um
7158840	7168920	that um that this this reciprocal expressing is is uh is i think uh important
7171560	7181000	uh i mean that's a reference i think uh although not blatant to the what hosso would call
7181000	7189480	originary character of inner subjective life um and also on the next page three sixty he comes
7189480	7196600	up with this term co-accomplishment in the middle of the page a co-accomplishment what kind there's
7196600	7210520	no individual there the co is is of course you know a small syllable very vague and and in any case
7210520	7215320	there's not really accomplishing going because that retains the cartesian sense that we're in
7215400	7225320	control of everything but the the the lockian uh sense that that we're in charge uh we have to
7225320	7232040	depart the enlightenment and discover and that's what sociology really is is is realizing the sense
7232040	7241320	in which the the structure like of the turn taking uh is running the show a lot of the time it's it's
7241320	7252520	not it's not that uh that that i'm being dishonest when when uh when there's a misunderstanding and i
7252520	7259080	don't explain the misunderstanding it's that i just didn't get a chance to talk because the
7259080	7264680	conversation didn't provide me with a turn and then the person said well why didn't you correct me
7264680	7271640	you know they feel wounded right but it's it's these things kind of run themselves we're not in
7271640	7277960	charge of everything in the rational decision science way that comes out of the enlightenment
7277960	7287480	mom so anyway this co-accomplishment though uh is uh needs our the kind of specification
7287480	7295240	re-specification that we're able to give to it uh and we give to it following the methodological
7295240	7300040	the principal methodological rule of our soul which is not theories but the things themselves
7302760	7313320	so uh um he's moving in the in the direction that we want but um i'm not sure that that his
7313320	7324600	attempts to explain it is always helpful um he says uh just a little bit below on 360 uh the
7324600	7336840	productions below what below the co-accomplishment uh the productions can reproduce their likenesses
7336840	7342760	from person to person well i don't know if that's how it happens reproduce it as though they exist
7342840	7348360	before and then the chain of the understanding of these repetitions what is self-evident turns
7348360	7355240	up as the same in the consciousness of the other uh that's that's a first attempt okay but it's
7355240	7361720	hardly the situation in the unity of the community of communication among several persons the repeatedly
7361720	7368680	produced structure becomes an object of consciousness not as a likeness but as the one structure
7368680	7374040	common to all well all by that it does become that the question is how does it become the one
7374040	7381000	structure common to all this is social work this is sociality this is the term that symbol
7381000	7389160	use this is what we what people are doing all the time is somehow get the one structure in common
7389160	7395640	that's why when i go to london i get scolded when i'm waiting in the bus line i mean i'm not budding
7395640	7404840	in but i'm just not participating in making this one structure common to all right so uh so this is
7404840	7418680	worth that people do and they do it in different ways in different places um so uh and that structure
7418680	7426120	come to all it's also dirt climbing um who shall ask how does the geometry he says the
7426120	7434520	primarily establishing geom geometry uh i'm not sure that that's adequate uh how does the
7434520	7443800	geometry express transform his internal structure in its ideality into something objective that's
7443800	7451080	that's really what we're interested in or he says on 159 how does the oh yeah i i read now um
7453480	7459880	then then he says uh back on 356 toward the bottom
7463560	7473720	and i wrote that out because i was at home and my my scanners was dying and i was desperate
7474760	7489880	um the uh he says the original where is that the original being itself there um
7492920	7497160	an original self evidence i'm not sure
7497320	7503720	oh no is it sorry it's on it's on 359
7505800	7507800	so i have a mistake in my notes
7513560	7519960	uh toward the bottom uh the original being itself there in the immediate
7520040	7527080	sea of its first production that is in original self evidence that's a very big term that's
7527080	7533560	where we're truth is things we really know for sure that we experience results in no
7533560	7539880	persisting acquisition at all that could have objective existence that is the original moment
7539880	7546440	when i have an insight when i'm tasting that coffee and i capture that flavor and i have no idea
7546440	7553560	how to describe it it's like it's like let's say a basket of fruit you know what do i what
7553560	7561480	how do i make this a persisting acquisition that that can lead to a lot of people communicating
7561480	7572440	about uh this is is such an important question that's our goal is to make our insights persisting
7572440	7578840	acquisitions that's why we need to objectivate them that's why we develop accounts and formulations
7578840	7587640	that persisting acquisition is everybody's daily work what hustle describes does happen pretty
7587640	7597720	much along the ways that he describes um but these objectivities are maybe already there uh
7598440	7607080	uh we they land in our lap passively as much as their active productions that we could go back
7607080	7615000	and do an archaeology of an excavation of and find out like what we were we're reading uh among
7615560	7623160	the the geometers and mathematicians uh that you can excavate and get where to start where
7623160	7630120	to go next where to go next we're already having these persisting acquisitions and that they persist
7630120	7637880	is recommends that we keep them that we that we retain them we might not even know what round
7637880	7643880	means to describe coffee but everybody's using the term so it's not going away so i might as well
7643880	7650920	understand what it means so we we need these acquisitions because they're part of the of the
7651640	7657320	of the palette it's not an empty palette they're a palette filled they're filled with this term
7657320	7664840	round and with different kind of senses so now how do we coordinate and reciprocally bring these
7664840	7674040	understandings into some kind of uh of of unity and if you look on 361 you might then be able to
7674040	7680360	understand this wonderful passage on this paragraph just below the middle on 361
7683400	7690600	and uh we might even end with this there is a distinction then between passively understanding
7690600	7695640	the expression and making itself evident by reactivating its meaning
7695960	7706120	but there are also exist possibilities of a kind of activity a thinking in terms of things
7706120	7713080	that have been taken up merely receptively passively which deals with significations only
7713080	7720440	passively understood and taken over without any of the self evidence of original activity
7721080	7727880	that's what i find amazing and why i included that in your reading is that's the point i'm trying
7727880	7738280	to make i mean husho often sees the flaw in his thinking he sees the most original solutions to
7738280	7744920	the problems and he even begins to describe them as he does here but then when he goes back to
7744920	7750040	recapping the general theory he seems to like like forget about them because it's too hard
7750440	7757880	and too indeterminate to uh to describe that but my critique that i just gave you
7757880	7765000	three minutes ago is in this passage you know maybe without any of the self evidence of original
7765000	7775160	activity so i'm amazed that uh that husho is just incredibly deep and so all i wanted to do today
7775160	7783880	was to convey to you and to people in ethno methodology that husho's deep okay and this
7784680	7792520	i'll leave it to you to reactivate and re-specify but that deepness is uh if you can use it if you
7792520	7801560	can't use it you know i'm not going to insist on it but um i'm i would say by way of concluding that
7801560	7813320	that one of my earliest professors peter berger would be very proud of me right now
