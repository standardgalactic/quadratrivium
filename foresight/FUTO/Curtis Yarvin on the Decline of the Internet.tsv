0	5760	I'm Aaron Wolff. I'm creating FUTO to try to get back tech freedom. I'm here with Curtis Yarvin
5760	13600	Who's been programming for decades like me and created the urban platform both for programming for a while in our lives and
14000	16000	We kind of met we kind of
16320	18320	experienced the decline of
18360	20280	Freedom for programmers
20280	25000	So I don't know what do you have to say about this? I don't know um freedom for programmers
25000	29120	I mean, you know my whole life. I've seen the decline of the internet. I mean the internet has really
29600	34680	Been declining for my entire adult life or mine, you know, since I was a teenager
35360	40080	Because really just in terms of the I mean, it's all eternal September
40080	48480	It's sort of the quality of material and the quality of the network becomes more centralized the quality of content goes down
48880	49920	You know
49920	54960	Usenet which was my first social introduction to the internet in like, you know
54960	62160	The late 80s was like miles beyond like what the reddit, which is the closest equivalence now
62240	69440	You know usenet was like a decentralized reddit with collective community governance. It was in an ontology
69760	71760	It was insane and today
73120	78560	Yeah, I mean it's like weird it's kind of like why do you think usenet even went away like it was it was fun
78880	82720	It was usenet was godlike usenet was sort of clearly the future
82960	86560	It went away, you know, my hypothesis is that usenet was
87440	89120	essentially
89120	92800	fell prey to something that happens to a lot of things which is that it essentially
93520	95280	assumed
95280	97280	Its quality
97280	101680	Was not the result of quality control. It had accidental quality control
102000	109360	It had accidental quality control because the only people who can get on usenet were like students at major universities or people working at tech companies
110160	116160	You know and so this is a population, you know with an average IQ of like 125 or whatever
116560	119280	Probably has the same average IQ as like burning man, right?
119680	124880	And when you have a large community that's sort of strongly selected in various ways
125040	128880	Even if the selection process is totally it's not like you had to apply to be on usenet
129200	132320	You just had to be in a certain kind of place at a certain kind of time
132960	138720	And what they realized was that especially well, I mean the thing that really killed them was the binaries groups that was
139680	148160	Yeah, but but but that was just retarded but um the and like more generally what killed them was what was called eternal september back then because
149600	153840	If I can explain the concept briefly the idea was that in september
154480	159600	A large group of clueless newbies would show up as freshmen at the local university and then
160160	166000	When they put aol, you know with a little all the little, you know floppy disks that they sent in the mail
166880	168880	Or I guess they were cds
169120	172080	Online suddenly all of the world's population
172480	175520	Could come on this thing and it just wasn't scaled for that
175920	181840	It wasn't scaled at the quality level and so basically it just suffered really rapid
182480	188080	Quality collapse. There's a term that I've heard about this. Sometimes sometimes evaporative cooling where basically
188640	193760	As you get like lower quality stuff people enter the higher quality people leave
193840	195840	I mean like and you know this drama
196320	198880	This happened at like clubhouse like just last year, right?
199200	205600	You know and so you need some kind of mechanism for things like this where you start
206320	207440	with
207440	210560	Maybe it starts with a kind of accidental quality control
211120	214800	And then when it starts to scale it develops like active quality control
215440	220320	Okay, yeah, I mean, but yeah, it's like quora went through the same quality goes down
220400	224240	And then some centralized solution comes because they actually can't have moderators and
224720	228720	Yeah, I mean you would hope that it would be possible to do distributed moderation
228720	233840	But it's obviously a very hard problem, right and so you have this, you know, internet where
234800	238800	You know, I was just talking to to joe about, you know, search and it's like
239280	243600	Google has created this like search desert like when you're searching you're looking for
244400	249360	UGC you're not looking for content that's put there to manipulate you you're looking for quality
249920	253120	And this is why everyone starts to search with like reddit.com
253760	257600	On right there in their searches and reddit is no great shakes either
257600	260800	But otherwise what you're getting is basically mainstream media articles
261280	267600	And seo garbage and wikipedia, right, right and then even now reddit starts to censor those things too
268160	271760	Yeah, and of course, yes reddit, you know, it's not the reddit doesn't have a censorship problem
271760	276080	But it's also that reddit has a just like shit to your redditor problem, right?
276160	279680	You know and you know occasionally you get these little glimpses
280160	284960	Of the kind of quality content that could exist on the internet. You get early usenet
284960	288800	You get quora early quora. You must remember early quora
289280	293280	I was actually very I used usenet and then I just disappeared into my little
293680	296960	My little startup that I did at yahoo and it was very much programming
297440	304000	But um, yeah, I mean we were yahoo message boards for the for finance just took over on finance
304000	306960	Yeah, they were there and there was there was quality content there, you know
307120	311520	But like these these these sort of accidental coherences of quality
312160	317040	Because of some sort of accidental filter are really hard to maintain
317600	321200	And of course the other thing that happened then was that um
322000	327920	You know things were sort of there was more of a default public ethos and then you know, there's another like
328640	333040	The death of the protocol I think is really like a super important event
333120	335120	Remember how everything was going to be rpc?
335520	341920	Okay, you know or like, you know, you're you're only there are bad protocols though. Yeah. Well, yeah, sure sure sure sure
341920	345120	But but I mean it's more than that so so it's like basically
345520	352160	You know the story I tell or one of the stories I tell about the death of the distributed internet was that it was in
353600	360000	Something I think was 98 and I'd convinced my company to send me really for no good reason to an itf meetup
360400	363760	And we were doing operating systems for like pre iphone
364320	369200	You know early japanese self remember how the japanese had had mobile, you know smartphones first
369920	373600	So we were doing operating systems for the japanese. This was at geoworks in berkeley
374240	381760	And the way that the japanese expected hardware manufacturers expected to work with us as an operating system founder
381760	382720	It was very simple
382720	386880	They would produce screenshots of what the device would show and we would make it show those screenshots
386960	391760	Okay, this is a very innovative way of specifying an operating system that perhaps you've never encountered before
392080	394080	Yeah, um
394960	398720	You know there there you go. Yeah, so, you know
399280	403280	They sent me to this itf, you know meeting and i'm in
403920	409120	The instant messaging and presence group, which is basically working on standardizing
409200	412880	What would later be called social network? It's what year would this be 98? Okay?
413280	419680	So so i'm in i'm in the room, you know with these people and basically this is where xmpp if you know xmpp
419760	425680	This is when yahoo messenger and icq. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah jabber jabber xmpp is basically jabber
425840	426800	I think great
426800	430240	We're all these things but it was an assumption that this would work the way email works
430720	434560	And it was like, oh, you know, there's going to be a protocol and if I want to talk to you my server
434560	438240	We'll talk to your server, you know through some like, you know
438560	442800	And that will be the normal way that we talk and I'll like connect to a port on your thing
443280	446880	And you know if you could have walked in there like 10 years later and be like
447760	449920	Okay, here's how we're actually going to solve the problem
451120	453440	Everyone is going to use one big server
455040	461360	Yeah, I mean even things like signal and telegram are just very centralized, right? Yeah, they're just facebook even right, you know
461680	467280	Like basically because facebook was instant messaging and presence and it's just like one big server
467680	471440	And you've basically gone back to you know, mainframes essentially
472320	475280	And and like that itself is sort of such a like
476080	479520	Compromise in the like revolution that we all expected
480640	486800	Right, right. I mean, I do feel like, you know, people are still trying to make progress, right? We've we've got uh, you know
486960	489600	Various projects like matrix the matrix project
490640	494960	I always I feel like it's a problem where the best engineers who I think this is all very solvable
495280	500560	But the problem is the best engineers. They're just tied up at google or you know, apple or whatever
500640	506400	They have no incentive to do things properly. No, no, no, no, no, I mean like, you know the the
507200	512720	I mean I started working on this problem in like 2002, right? And it was just like
513360	517840	Clear that nothing well, I have a very maximalist approach to the problem
517920	524720	But like it was sort of clear that nothing like what I wanted to do could be done either in academia or in
525360	531120	big companies or really in as a straight open source project and had too much sort of structure for that
531200	537360	It was like so it's sort of like startups was sort of the only form left and it was not a good fit
538480	542480	Yeah, I mean startups basically want to get acquired by google. Sure. I mean and start sure
542560	546240	I mean and they have the lifespan in a mark and recent calls them like firefly startups
546240	549200	They have the lifespan of a firefly. It's like so like, you know
549760	551760	Y-combinator like funds, I don't know
552240	556560	I don't know what it even means for like y-combinator to fund like a fusion thing
556960	563280	Like we actually got into y-combinator and then we were like, but why would we do this like, you know, and you know
563360	568240	Well, I mean, it doesn't hurt. I mean, well, they want seven percent, right? Okay. Well, that's actually I don't think it was
568320	571760	I don't know that it was the right decision. It was a bad decision taken by my first
571840	576960	Well, I mean, they're gonna steer you to what most I'm gonna steer you either to like be a
577760	582880	An Airbnb, but probably they're gonna steer you to get aqua hired by google. That's mostly what y-combinator does
583280	589600	I think that yeah, I think they do consider that a failure mode, but like that's better than what you think the percentage
589840	594560	Oh, the percentages are not great, but the percentages enable them to make money. I don't know, you know
