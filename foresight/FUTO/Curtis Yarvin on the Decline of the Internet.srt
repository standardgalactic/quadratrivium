1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,760
I'm Aaron Wolff. I'm creating FUTO to try to get back tech freedom. I'm here with Curtis Yarvin

2
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:13,600
Who's been programming for decades like me and created the urban platform both for programming for a while in our lives and

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
We kind of met we kind of

4
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:18,320
experienced the decline of

5
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:20,280
Freedom for programmers

6
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:25,000
So I don't know what do you have to say about this? I don't know um freedom for programmers

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,120
I mean, you know my whole life. I've seen the decline of the internet. I mean the internet has really

8
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:34,680
Been declining for my entire adult life or mine, you know, since I was a teenager

9
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:40,080
Because really just in terms of the I mean, it's all eternal September

10
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:48,480
It's sort of the quality of material and the quality of the network becomes more centralized the quality of content goes down

11
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:49,920
You know

12
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:54,960
Usenet which was my first social introduction to the internet in like, you know

13
00:00:54,960 --> 00:01:02,160
The late 80s was like miles beyond like what the reddit, which is the closest equivalence now

14
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:09,440
You know usenet was like a decentralized reddit with collective community governance. It was in an ontology

15
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:11,760
It was insane and today

16
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:18,560
Yeah, I mean it's like weird it's kind of like why do you think usenet even went away like it was it was fun

17
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:22,720
It was usenet was godlike usenet was sort of clearly the future

18
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:26,560
It went away, you know, my hypothesis is that usenet was

19
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:29,120
essentially

20
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:32,800
fell prey to something that happens to a lot of things which is that it essentially

21
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:35,280
assumed

22
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:37,280
Its quality

23
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:41,680
Was not the result of quality control. It had accidental quality control

24
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:49,360
It had accidental quality control because the only people who can get on usenet were like students at major universities or people working at tech companies

25
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:56,160
You know and so this is a population, you know with an average IQ of like 125 or whatever

26
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:59,280
Probably has the same average IQ as like burning man, right?

27
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:04,880
And when you have a large community that's sort of strongly selected in various ways

28
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:08,880
Even if the selection process is totally it's not like you had to apply to be on usenet

29
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:12,320
You just had to be in a certain kind of place at a certain kind of time

30
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:18,720
And what they realized was that especially well, I mean the thing that really killed them was the binaries groups that was

31
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:28,160
Yeah, but but but that was just retarded but um the and like more generally what killed them was what was called eternal september back then because

32
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:33,840
If I can explain the concept briefly the idea was that in september

33
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:39,600
A large group of clueless newbies would show up as freshmen at the local university and then

34
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:46,000
When they put aol, you know with a little all the little, you know floppy disks that they sent in the mail

35
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:48,880
Or I guess they were cds

36
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:52,080
Online suddenly all of the world's population

37
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:55,520
Could come on this thing and it just wasn't scaled for that

38
00:02:55,920 --> 00:03:01,840
It wasn't scaled at the quality level and so basically it just suffered really rapid

39
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:08,080
Quality collapse. There's a term that I've heard about this. Sometimes sometimes evaporative cooling where basically

40
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:13,760
As you get like lower quality stuff people enter the higher quality people leave

41
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:15,840
I mean like and you know this drama

42
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:18,880
This happened at like clubhouse like just last year, right?

43
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:25,600
You know and so you need some kind of mechanism for things like this where you start

44
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:27,440
with

45
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:30,560
Maybe it starts with a kind of accidental quality control

46
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:34,800
And then when it starts to scale it develops like active quality control

47
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:40,320
Okay, yeah, I mean, but yeah, it's like quora went through the same quality goes down

48
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:44,240
And then some centralized solution comes because they actually can't have moderators and

49
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:48,720
Yeah, I mean you would hope that it would be possible to do distributed moderation

50
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:53,840
But it's obviously a very hard problem, right and so you have this, you know, internet where

51
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:58,800
You know, I was just talking to to joe about, you know, search and it's like

52
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:03,600
Google has created this like search desert like when you're searching you're looking for

53
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:09,360
UGC you're not looking for content that's put there to manipulate you you're looking for quality

54
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:13,120
And this is why everyone starts to search with like reddit.com

55
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:17,600
On right there in their searches and reddit is no great shakes either

56
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:20,800
But otherwise what you're getting is basically mainstream media articles

57
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:27,600
And seo garbage and wikipedia, right, right and then even now reddit starts to censor those things too

58
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:31,760
Yeah, and of course, yes reddit, you know, it's not the reddit doesn't have a censorship problem

59
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:36,080
But it's also that reddit has a just like shit to your redditor problem, right?

60
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:39,680
You know and you know occasionally you get these little glimpses

61
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:44,960
Of the kind of quality content that could exist on the internet. You get early usenet

62
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:48,800
You get quora early quora. You must remember early quora

63
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:53,280
I was actually very I used usenet and then I just disappeared into my little

64
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:56,960
My little startup that I did at yahoo and it was very much programming

65
00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:04,000
But um, yeah, I mean we were yahoo message boards for the for finance just took over on finance

66
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,960
Yeah, they were there and there was there was quality content there, you know

67
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:11,520
But like these these these sort of accidental coherences of quality

68
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:17,040
Because of some sort of accidental filter are really hard to maintain

69
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:21,200
And of course the other thing that happened then was that um

70
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:27,920
You know things were sort of there was more of a default public ethos and then you know, there's another like

71
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:33,040
The death of the protocol I think is really like a super important event

72
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:35,120
Remember how everything was going to be rpc?

73
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:41,920
Okay, you know or like, you know, you're you're only there are bad protocols though. Yeah. Well, yeah, sure sure sure sure

74
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:45,120
But but I mean it's more than that so so it's like basically

75
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:52,160
You know the story I tell or one of the stories I tell about the death of the distributed internet was that it was in

76
00:05:53,600 --> 00:06:00,000
Something I think was 98 and I'd convinced my company to send me really for no good reason to an itf meetup

77
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:03,760
And we were doing operating systems for like pre iphone

78
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:09,200
You know early japanese self remember how the japanese had had mobile, you know smartphones first

79
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:13,600
So we were doing operating systems for the japanese. This was at geoworks in berkeley

80
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:21,760
And the way that the japanese expected hardware manufacturers expected to work with us as an operating system founder

81
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:22,720
It was very simple

82
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:26,880
They would produce screenshots of what the device would show and we would make it show those screenshots

83
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:31,760
Okay, this is a very innovative way of specifying an operating system that perhaps you've never encountered before

84
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:34,080
Yeah, um

85
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:38,720
You know there there you go. Yeah, so, you know

86
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:43,280
They sent me to this itf, you know meeting and i'm in

87
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:49,120
The instant messaging and presence group, which is basically working on standardizing

88
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:52,880
What would later be called social network? It's what year would this be 98? Okay?

89
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:59,680
So so i'm in i'm in the room, you know with these people and basically this is where xmpp if you know xmpp

90
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:05,680
This is when yahoo messenger and icq. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah jabber jabber xmpp is basically jabber

91
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:06,800
I think great

92
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:10,240
We're all these things but it was an assumption that this would work the way email works

93
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:14,560
And it was like, oh, you know, there's going to be a protocol and if I want to talk to you my server

94
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:18,240
We'll talk to your server, you know through some like, you know

95
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:22,800
And that will be the normal way that we talk and I'll like connect to a port on your thing

96
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:26,880
And you know if you could have walked in there like 10 years later and be like

97
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:29,920
Okay, here's how we're actually going to solve the problem

98
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:33,440
Everyone is going to use one big server

99
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:41,360
Yeah, I mean even things like signal and telegram are just very centralized, right? Yeah, they're just facebook even right, you know

100
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:47,280
Like basically because facebook was instant messaging and presence and it's just like one big server

101
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:51,440
And you've basically gone back to you know, mainframes essentially

102
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:55,280
And and like that itself is sort of such a like

103
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:59,520
Compromise in the like revolution that we all expected

104
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:06,800
Right, right. I mean, I do feel like, you know, people are still trying to make progress, right? We've we've got uh, you know

105
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:09,600
Various projects like matrix the matrix project

106
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:14,960
I always I feel like it's a problem where the best engineers who I think this is all very solvable

107
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:20,560
But the problem is the best engineers. They're just tied up at google or you know, apple or whatever

108
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:26,400
They have no incentive to do things properly. No, no, no, no, no, I mean like, you know the the

109
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:32,720
I mean I started working on this problem in like 2002, right? And it was just like

110
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:37,840
Clear that nothing well, I have a very maximalist approach to the problem

111
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:44,720
But like it was sort of clear that nothing like what I wanted to do could be done either in academia or in

112
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:51,120
big companies or really in as a straight open source project and had too much sort of structure for that

113
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:57,360
It was like so it's sort of like startups was sort of the only form left and it was not a good fit

114
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:02,480
Yeah, I mean startups basically want to get acquired by google. Sure. I mean and start sure

115
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:06,240
I mean and they have the lifespan in a mark and recent calls them like firefly startups

116
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:09,200
They have the lifespan of a firefly. It's like so like, you know

117
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:11,760
Y-combinator like funds, I don't know

118
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:16,560
I don't know what it even means for like y-combinator to fund like a fusion thing

119
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:23,280
Like we actually got into y-combinator and then we were like, but why would we do this like, you know, and you know

120
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:28,240
Well, I mean, it doesn't hurt. I mean, well, they want seven percent, right? Okay. Well, that's actually I don't think it was

121
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:31,760
I don't know that it was the right decision. It was a bad decision taken by my first

122
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:36,960
Well, I mean, they're gonna steer you to what most I'm gonna steer you either to like be a

123
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:42,880
An Airbnb, but probably they're gonna steer you to get aqua hired by google. That's mostly what y-combinator does

124
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:49,600
I think that yeah, I think they do consider that a failure mode, but like that's better than what you think the percentage

125
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:54,560
Oh, the percentages are not great, but the percentages enable them to make money. I don't know, you know
