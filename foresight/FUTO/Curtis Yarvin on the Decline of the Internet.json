{"text": " I'm Aaron Wolff. I'm creating FUTO to try to get back tech freedom. I'm here with Curtis Yarvin Who's been programming for decades like me and created the urban platform both for programming for a while in our lives and We kind of met we kind of experienced the decline of Freedom for programmers So I don't know what do you have to say about this? I don't know um freedom for programmers I mean, you know my whole life. I've seen the decline of the internet. I mean the internet has really Been declining for my entire adult life or mine, you know, since I was a teenager Because really just in terms of the I mean, it's all eternal September It's sort of the quality of material and the quality of the network becomes more centralized the quality of content goes down You know Usenet which was my first social introduction to the internet in like, you know The late 80s was like miles beyond like what the reddit, which is the closest equivalence now You know usenet was like a decentralized reddit with collective community governance. It was in an ontology It was insane and today Yeah, I mean it's like weird it's kind of like why do you think usenet even went away like it was it was fun It was usenet was godlike usenet was sort of clearly the future It went away, you know, my hypothesis is that usenet was essentially fell prey to something that happens to a lot of things which is that it essentially assumed Its quality Was not the result of quality control. It had accidental quality control It had accidental quality control because the only people who can get on usenet were like students at major universities or people working at tech companies You know and so this is a population, you know with an average IQ of like 125 or whatever Probably has the same average IQ as like burning man, right? And when you have a large community that's sort of strongly selected in various ways Even if the selection process is totally it's not like you had to apply to be on usenet You just had to be in a certain kind of place at a certain kind of time And what they realized was that especially well, I mean the thing that really killed them was the binaries groups that was Yeah, but but but that was just retarded but um the and like more generally what killed them was what was called eternal september back then because If I can explain the concept briefly the idea was that in september A large group of clueless newbies would show up as freshmen at the local university and then When they put aol, you know with a little all the little, you know floppy disks that they sent in the mail Or I guess they were cds Online suddenly all of the world's population Could come on this thing and it just wasn't scaled for that It wasn't scaled at the quality level and so basically it just suffered really rapid Quality collapse. There's a term that I've heard about this. Sometimes sometimes evaporative cooling where basically As you get like lower quality stuff people enter the higher quality people leave I mean like and you know this drama This happened at like clubhouse like just last year, right? You know and so you need some kind of mechanism for things like this where you start with Maybe it starts with a kind of accidental quality control And then when it starts to scale it develops like active quality control Okay, yeah, I mean, but yeah, it's like quora went through the same quality goes down And then some centralized solution comes because they actually can't have moderators and Yeah, I mean you would hope that it would be possible to do distributed moderation But it's obviously a very hard problem, right and so you have this, you know, internet where You know, I was just talking to to joe about, you know, search and it's like Google has created this like search desert like when you're searching you're looking for UGC you're not looking for content that's put there to manipulate you you're looking for quality And this is why everyone starts to search with like reddit.com On right there in their searches and reddit is no great shakes either But otherwise what you're getting is basically mainstream media articles And seo garbage and wikipedia, right, right and then even now reddit starts to censor those things too Yeah, and of course, yes reddit, you know, it's not the reddit doesn't have a censorship problem But it's also that reddit has a just like shit to your redditor problem, right? You know and you know occasionally you get these little glimpses Of the kind of quality content that could exist on the internet. You get early usenet You get quora early quora. You must remember early quora I was actually very I used usenet and then I just disappeared into my little My little startup that I did at yahoo and it was very much programming But um, yeah, I mean we were yahoo message boards for the for finance just took over on finance Yeah, they were there and there was there was quality content there, you know But like these these these sort of accidental coherences of quality Because of some sort of accidental filter are really hard to maintain And of course the other thing that happened then was that um You know things were sort of there was more of a default public ethos and then you know, there's another like The death of the protocol I think is really like a super important event Remember how everything was going to be rpc? Okay, you know or like, you know, you're you're only there are bad protocols though. Yeah. Well, yeah, sure sure sure sure But but I mean it's more than that so so it's like basically You know the story I tell or one of the stories I tell about the death of the distributed internet was that it was in Something I think was 98 and I'd convinced my company to send me really for no good reason to an itf meetup And we were doing operating systems for like pre iphone You know early japanese self remember how the japanese had had mobile, you know smartphones first So we were doing operating systems for the japanese. This was at geoworks in berkeley And the way that the japanese expected hardware manufacturers expected to work with us as an operating system founder It was very simple They would produce screenshots of what the device would show and we would make it show those screenshots Okay, this is a very innovative way of specifying an operating system that perhaps you've never encountered before Yeah, um You know there there you go. Yeah, so, you know They sent me to this itf, you know meeting and i'm in The instant messaging and presence group, which is basically working on standardizing What would later be called social network? It's what year would this be 98? Okay? So so i'm in i'm in the room, you know with these people and basically this is where xmpp if you know xmpp This is when yahoo messenger and icq. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah jabber jabber xmpp is basically jabber I think great We're all these things but it was an assumption that this would work the way email works And it was like, oh, you know, there's going to be a protocol and if I want to talk to you my server We'll talk to your server, you know through some like, you know And that will be the normal way that we talk and I'll like connect to a port on your thing And you know if you could have walked in there like 10 years later and be like Okay, here's how we're actually going to solve the problem Everyone is going to use one big server Yeah, I mean even things like signal and telegram are just very centralized, right? Yeah, they're just facebook even right, you know Like basically because facebook was instant messaging and presence and it's just like one big server And you've basically gone back to you know, mainframes essentially And and like that itself is sort of such a like Compromise in the like revolution that we all expected Right, right. I mean, I do feel like, you know, people are still trying to make progress, right? We've we've got uh, you know Various projects like matrix the matrix project I always I feel like it's a problem where the best engineers who I think this is all very solvable But the problem is the best engineers. They're just tied up at google or you know, apple or whatever They have no incentive to do things properly. No, no, no, no, no, I mean like, you know the the I mean I started working on this problem in like 2002, right? And it was just like Clear that nothing well, I have a very maximalist approach to the problem But like it was sort of clear that nothing like what I wanted to do could be done either in academia or in big companies or really in as a straight open source project and had too much sort of structure for that It was like so it's sort of like startups was sort of the only form left and it was not a good fit Yeah, I mean startups basically want to get acquired by google. Sure. I mean and start sure I mean and they have the lifespan in a mark and recent calls them like firefly startups They have the lifespan of a firefly. It's like so like, you know Y-combinator like funds, I don't know I don't know what it even means for like y-combinator to fund like a fusion thing Like we actually got into y-combinator and then we were like, but why would we do this like, you know, and you know Well, I mean, it doesn't hurt. I mean, well, they want seven percent, right? Okay. Well, that's actually I don't think it was I don't know that it was the right decision. It was a bad decision taken by my first Well, I mean, they're gonna steer you to what most I'm gonna steer you either to like be a An Airbnb, but probably they're gonna steer you to get aqua hired by google. That's mostly what y-combinator does I think that yeah, I think they do consider that a failure mode, but like that's better than what you think the percentage Oh, the percentages are not great, but the percentages enable them to make money.
