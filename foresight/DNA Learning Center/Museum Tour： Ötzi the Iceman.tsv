0	24000	Hi! I'm so glad you made it! Come on in!
31000	38000	Welcome to the DNA Learning Center. I'm Amanda, and I'm going to show you around the Our Human Inheritance exhibit. Follow me!
42000	54000	We're going to start with the man of the hour, Otsi the Iceman. This is the world's first replica of Otsi the Iceman, one of the world's most famous mummies.
54000	63000	You might be wondering, how did we know his name? It's a really good question. I'm asked that question very often. If you look up on the wall, you'll see the spelling.
64000	78000	First, he was just the Iceman, because this mummy was found buried in ice. But then came the nickname Otsi, because he was found in the Utsil Alps, which is a range that spans from Austria down into Italy.
78000	87000	In fact, if you look at the wall behind our replica of Otsi the Iceman, that is the actual mountainside where this mummy was recovered.
88000	99000	I'm going to spend some time today telling you a little bit about why this find was so important to our understanding of what life was like for people during the Neolithic.
99000	109000	Which is a period of time that was pretty exciting in the history of humans, when civilizations actually first started to spring up in places like the Middle East and in Europe.
110000	113000	So we're going to start at the very beginning. Follow me over here.
114000	121000	Otsi the Iceman was found in Italy by some hikers who happened to be on vacation.
121000	126000	Now in this picture, the hikers we're seeing are not the hikers who found him.
127000	130000	The hikers who found him were Erika and Helmut Simon.
131000	140000	They were advanced hikers and decided to go on a path that normally hikers did not travel on, and it was a very warm season the summer before.
141000	148000	And that September day in the distance, they saw part of Otsi's head sticking up out of a glacier.
148000	154000	What we're seeing here is more exposure of his body than Erika and Helmut actually saw.
155000	157000	They saw just the top of his head, barely exposed.
158000	166000	From what I've read, they went over because they thought what they saw was a piece of trash, and it turned out it was actually a human head.
167000	174000	Probably a big surprise. I don't know what you would do if that was your find on the mountainside, but I think I'd be terrified.
175000	182000	Well, they went and found the park rangers who confirmed that this did indeed look like the body of a human stuck in the ice.
183000	192000	And everyone was pretty sure this was probably just a poor unfortunate hiker who went missing in the mountains, which apparently is quite common on this range.
193000	198000	So they proceeded to try to remove the body from the ice with drills.
198000	205000	Well, drilling was not a very good idea because Port Otsi's body was damaged. I'll be showing you the damage later.
206000	211000	What they wound up having to do was try to melt the ice around his body, which took several days.
212000	218000	And while they were melting the ice around his body, they started to find some of his belongings, things that he had with him when he died on the mountain.
219000	227000	We have replicas here in our exhibit of his belongings, including his clothing and some of the things he had been carrying with him before he died.
229000	239000	These were pretty clear indicators that it was likely he was not a hiker who had gone missing a few decades prior, but maybe a little more ancient than they originally thought.
240000	242000	I'm going to start with his clothing.
243000	247000	So let's see shoes are a real find.
248000	253000	Some of the finest shoes from this period of time that anthropologists and archaeologists have ever seen.
253000	262000	They may not look very fancy to you, but they were very carefully crafted out of tree bast, which is, I had to look this up, believe it or not,
263000	269000	the material that's under the bark of a tree, somewhat stringy, and it can be used to make very strong netting or roping.
270000	279000	So this is tree bast that was carefully woven together, and that netting held hay all around Otsi's foot.
279000	284000	In fact, one of his shoes was actually still on his foot when they removed his body from the ice.
285000	289000	And then there was on top of this, which we can't see, animal hide holding everything together.
290000	295000	And along the bottom, there were also strips of animal hide, probably to give him traction in the snow.
296000	299000	Pretty well produced shoes.
301000	306000	He had a cloak that was made of grass matting, very carefully woven together.
306000	311000	We think maybe it was a cover for the rain, maybe something that he could lay down on.
312000	318000	His clothing were remnants at this point, made mostly of animal skin.
319000	326000	So he had leggings that covered from his ankles up to his thighs, a loincloth that passed between his legs and attached to his belt,
327000	334000	a coat that was made of a few different colors of animal pelts, so it was maybe high fashion for the time.
335000	338000	And then the bear fur hat.
339000	347000	Most of the things he was wearing were made out of skin from animals like goats or sheep that were domesticated, that humans were keeping on farms.
348000	354000	The bear fur hat, though, is a little bit different, certainly not a domesticated bear, probably a wild bear.
355000	359000	And what we think is that it might have even been a bear that he hunted himself,
359000	364000	and that having this special bear fur hat might have been an item of stature for him.
365000	371000	So right away some of the things he was wearing are telling us a little bit about this mysterious man on the mountain.
372000	374000	Let's look at some of the other artifacts down here.
375000	379000	He was carrying homemade arrows, he had a set of arrows, only two of them were completed.
380000	385000	There were a bunch of uncompleted arrows, and again, a quiver made of animal pelt,
385000	391000	and there was a one strip of wood, I believe it was hazel wood that was used to build the quiver.
392000	396000	The finished arrows were made by two different people.
397000	402000	We think maybe he made one of them, but the other one was probably made by someone else.
403000	405000	Now how could we possibly know that?
406000	411000	It turns out that when the pieces of feather are attached to the wood,
411000	418000	there's string that's folded around the wood in a certain direction, right-handed or left-handed.
419000	423000	And it looks like one of the arrows was strung, there's string up here too by the arrow head,
424000	427000	in a right-handed direction, and the other in a left-handed direction.
428000	434000	Maybe someone made the arrow for him, maybe he found it somewhere, we may never know, but a very interesting tale.
435000	440000	One of the most fantastic things that he was carrying was this axe.
441000	443000	So what's so special about the axe?
444000	450000	The axe is made of a handle that comes from a yew tree, and yew wood is very, very strong,
451000	455000	and does not secrete a lot of sap, that sticky stuff that comes out of wood when you cut it.
456000	459000	So it's good material for a handle, it's not going to get sticky.
460000	465000	But what was really impressive was the metal that was used on this axe, almost 100% copper.
466000	470000	This is important, this tells us a little bit about when he lived.
471000	475000	This is a period of time that you may have heard of called the copper age, which started in the Middle East,
476000	479000	the use of copper to make tools, and moved into Europe.
480000	488000	And the fact that he had a copper axe told us a little bit about maybe when the copper age began in Europe, where he came from.
489000	492000	We'll come back to this, so don't forget, copper, very important.
493000	497000	We think that Utsi the Iceman may have actually smelted this copper himself.
497000	503000	So smelting is when the metal is removed from rock, you have to make it very, very hot.
504000	507000	And when you do this, arsenic is actually released into the air.
508000	514000	And he had high levels of arsenic in his hair that was analyzed after the body was removed from the ice.
515000	518000	And he also had arsenic in his lungs, he had been breathing it.
519000	524000	So this might have been a man who was not just a hunter, but was also a smelter of metal,
524000	531000	and maybe a man of stature in his community, a well-rounded man of many skills.
532000	539000	He had a utility belt also made of animal skin, and in the utility belt, there was a more stone age looking tool made of flint, a little dagger.
540000	544000	That dagger was housed in a small pouch that was also made of bast.
545000	550000	And then this tool is one of my favorites because it looks like a giant crayon, it's called a retoucher.
550000	557000	And this is actually made of lime wood, so he used different wood for different products depending on the qualities of the wood.
558000	559000	I think that's just amazing.
560000	564000	And on the tip, what looks like the point of a crayon is actually a piece of an antler.
565000	568000	Now what do you think this tool could possibly be used for?
569000	571000	It was a mystery to me, I had to do a little bit of research.
572000	574000	Well a retoucher is used to sharpen things.
574000	581000	So that antler was probably used quite often to sharpen and resharpen that flint dagger that he was carrying around with him.
582000	585000	In fact, we know that that dagger had been sharpened many times.
586000	587000	Amazing.
588000	594000	Now in addition to these items, there are some other very interesting things over here that I'd like you to look at.
595000	598000	So these also are recreations of a few other things that Utsi was carrying with him.
598000	605000	And by the way, he was carrying over 60 pounds of stuff on his body.
606000	615000	After everything had been collected from the scene, this was deduced by the scientists who were analyzing the find.
616000	618000	And actually, not everything was found at once.
619000	626000	So some of these items were found in the very beginning in late September and early October in 1991 when the mummy was found.
626000	631000	But there was another expedition months later where several other items were collected.
632000	636000	He was carrying two containers like this made of birch bark.
637000	638000	So I don't know if you've ever seen birch trees.
639000	642000	We used to have a lot of birch trees here on Long Island, but I think that they've died.
643000	648000	Birch bark is white on the outside and flaky.
649000	650000	And it's bendy.
651000	652000	So you can make it into different shapes.
652000	656000	And birch trees also can be used to make material like glue.
657000	663000	So these birch bark containers were carefully sewn and glued together and they were used to carry things.
664000	666000	One of the birch bark containers was completely intact.
667000	672000	I think the other one accidentally was stepped on when the scene was being collected.
673000	681000	In one of the birch bark containers, there were pieces of charcoal, maybe not even charcoal, my apologies, burnt pieces of wood.
682000	684000	There were maple leaves that looked like they had been burned.
685000	688000	And there was a fungus called tinder fungus.
689000	692000	Tinder fungus can actually be used as a fire starter.
693000	699000	And there were little flecks of iron pyrite in the tinder fungus, which probably helped to light it.
700000	705000	So what we think is that Uzi was carrying around the tinder fungus inside his birch bark container.
705000	712000	And it carried a glow and it made it much easier for him to start fires very quickly as he was traveling around the mountains.
713000	714000	Fantastic.
715000	718000	The maple leaves were probably used to insulate the container.
719000	726000	And then in the other birch bark container, he had some other tools and something kind of like a first aid kit, believe it or not.
727000	732000	There was a second fungus called a polypore fungus that actually has medicinal properties.
732000	738000	So here's another clue. Maybe he was a medicine man or a shaman in his community.
740000	750000	He was carrying a fungus that had antibiotic properties, that had styptic properties, which means it can stop bleeding.
751000	760000	And it can also be used to relieve intestinal discomfort, which would have come in handy because it turns out this ice man had a pretty nasty case of whipworm.
761000	770000	He had this tool here, which is a stone disc made of a special kind of marble with tree-bast strings coming off and feathers.
771000	777000	What we think is that maybe that was attached to his belt and was used to carry small prey that he had caught, maybe small birds or rabbits.
778000	779000	They were tied to the strings.
780000	790000	And then in addition, some extra antler pieces and some more homemade bast threading and animal hides used to attach things to his utility belt.
791000	792000	Amazing.
793000	801000	So I'm sure you're all wondering, based on the things he was carrying with him, how old is this man?
802000	803000	Do we think he was a hiker?
803000	808000	I don't think that a hiker 60 years ago would have been carrying around a copper axe.
809000	814000	So everyone knew, after his find, that he was probably much older.
815000	818000	Now, I don't know what you would guess. I'd probably guess maybe he's a few hundred years old.
819000	820000	Well, let's go back to the mummy.
823000	825000	Take a look. He looks pretty old.
826000	833000	A technique called carbon dating was used shortly after he was taken to Austria for his first set of analysis.
834000	843000	And carbon dating revealed, are you ready, that he was 5,300 years old.
845000	846000	Wow.
847000	854000	He lived several hundred years before Stonehenge was built, a few hundred years before there were any big Egyptian pyramids built.
855000	856000	He's old.
857000	862000	So how did his body remain in such good condition?
863000	865000	Well, you may not think it's good condition, but think about it.
866000	872000	Usually when someone dies, what happens to the soft parts of the body, like the skin and the muscle and the organs?
874000	875000	They decompose.
876000	879000	There are microorganisms that will come along and break down all of those soft tissues.
880000	883000	And what would we expect to find 5,000 years later if we're lucky?
883000	889000	Maybe some bones, but his whole body was completely preserved.
890000	895000	So what was different about his body than most average people?
896000	897000	Well, it wasn't what was different about his body.
898000	899000	It's where his body was.
900000	908000	So don't forget, he was found on a mountain over 10,000 feet up in the air above sea level.
909000	912000	I don't know if you've ever been on the top of a mountain, but it can be very cold.
913000	914000	There's dry wind blowing around.
915000	922000	And what scientists think is that within a short period of time after he died, he was probably covered by a layer of snow.
923000	925000	And his tissues started to freeze quite fast.
926000	931000	All the microorganisms that probably would have started to decompose the body died too.
932000	939000	And then over a period of time, that very cold, dry wind wicked the moisture out of his tissues.
940000	946000	All of the water was pulled out and his body pretty much, in essence, was freeze-dried.
947000	954000	He looks a little freeze-dried, but what we can see is his skin still surrounding his body.
955000	956000	And it's not just his skin that's still there.
957000	959000	Inside the skin are all of his organs.
960000	963000	The whole digestive system, the brain, the heart.
964000	965000	So we have a whole human body.
966000	970000	And from that body, there are all kinds of interesting things we can learn.
971000	973000	Now I do want to show you the damage.
974000	982000	So if you come around this side, you'll see there's a large part of his backside missing.
983000	986000	So Utsi did not live with only half a backside.
986000	993000	This is what happened when researchers tried to remove him with pneumatic drills.
994000	997000	His body was quite delicate and they lost a piece.
998000	1003000	I was actually asked recently, what did they do with the piece that was removed?
1004000	1005000	I have no idea.
1006000	1009000	I would imagine that it traveled to Austria with the rest of his body.
1010000	1015000	And maybe it was helpful in some of the analysis because they had some tissue that had already been removed from his body.
1016000	1020000	But what this damage did was it exposed some of his internal organs.
1021000	1024000	Now, how did this replica get made?
1025000	1028000	I'm sure already you're thinking, this looks very realistic.
1029000	1031000	The real mummy is in Italy.
1032000	1036000	If you wanted to see Utsi the Iceman, you would have to go to a small town called Bolzano, Italy.
1037000	1041000	And there's a museum there just for him called the South Tyrol Museum of Archaeology.
1042000	1044000	They keep the mummy in an ice compartment.
1044000	1046000	You can see him through a porthole.
1047000	1053000	And every once in a while they have to spray water over his body to keep his tissues in that kind of permanently frozen state.
1054000	1060000	Our replica though has all the details that you'd be able to see on the real Utsi, the Iceman,
1061000	1067000	if you were able to take a closer look, including the damage to his body and some other very interesting things.
1068000	1070000	But what I'd like to do is show you how the mummy was made.
1070000	1077000	We consigned an artist who specializes in making ancient recreations to make the model for us.
1078000	1084000	And he relied on a company in Belgium called Materialize, which does 3D printing.
1085000	1091000	I've never done 3D printing myself, but I know a lot of kids who have done 3D printing at school or who have 3D printers at home.
1092000	1098000	But imagine the size the 3D printer has to be to make something this big.
1098000	1105000	Well, it turns out in Belgium, Materialize has one of the world's largest 3D printers.
1106000	1113000	Now, in order to do the 3D printing, we first needed access to CAT scans of Utsi's body.
1114000	1115000	Who had those?
1116000	1120000	Well, our friends at the museum in Bolzano provided those CAT scans for us.
1121000	1124000	And with CAT scans and modern technology like 3D printing,
1124000	1131000	we were able to get everything we needed to our artist, Gary Staub, so that he could build this replica for us.
1132000	1133000	And believe it or not, he's made three of these.
1134000	1135000	This is the first.
1136000	1142000	The second was given to the Museum of South Tyrol so that they can use it for a traveling exhibit.
1143000	1151000	And the third is safe in a box, waiting to be put on exhibit at a DNA learning center that will be opening in Brooklyn in the near future.
1152000	1153000	But come this way.
1154000	1159000	I have a clip here that shows how the model was built.
1160000	1162000	So here we are in the beautiful town of Bolzano, Italy.
1163000	1164000	It's the very northern tip of Italy.
1165000	1167000	And there he is, the real Utsi the Iceman.
1168000	1171000	You'll see everyone's wearing sterile gowns and gloves and masks.
1172000	1179000	No one wants to contaminate the mummy with their own bacteria for fear that those bacteria could decompose his tissues.
1179000	1187000	And you saw them spraying water over his body to keep that kind of layer of permafrost and maintain his tissues frozen.
1188000	1196000	These are pictures of the CAT scans that were lent to us from the South Tyrol Museum of Archaeology and they were sent to materialize in Belgium.
1197000	1199000	So here is a 3D rendering.
1200000	1202000	That's exactly what's going to come out of the 3D printer.
1203000	1204000	Now this is a very long process.
1205000	1206000	This doesn't happen in an hour.
1206000	1213000	But what we're going to see is him rising up out of the printer from a liquid bed of resin.
1214000	1215000	Amazing.
1216000	1218000	Did you notice he's missing his hands?
1219000	1221000	It turns out, look, no hands.
1222000	1229000	When the CAT scans were produced, his hands didn't fit in the tube that they were trying to slide him through to get the scans.
1230000	1236000	So one of the tasks that our artist was faced with was to create the hands from scratch.
1237000	1246000	What you're seeing him doing now is taking the resin 3D printed version, which is kind of like a clear plastic, and texturizing it.
1248000	1251000	His goal ultimately is going to be to make a cast.
1252000	1253000	And a cast is like a mold.
1253000	1262000	And the important thing about a cast or a mold is that once you've produced an accurate cast or mold, you can make as many replicas as you want.
1263000	1274000	So once the head was fastened back on and texturized and he had the hands completed, they started the very long process of creating the cast, which you see before you now.
1275000	1284000	Many layers are applied and then fiberglass is placed on top and then painted again.
1285000	1293000	Once the cast was complete, Gary was able to make the final version out of another resin material and other mixed media.
1294000	1297000	So what we're seeing him doing now is decorating.
1298000	1307000	He's painting and designing, texturizing, doing all of the things that he needed to do to make this model look as realistic as possible.
1308000	1313000	There he is working on the wounded area, which was one of the most difficult parts to recreate.
1316000	1323000	And he had to make it sturdy enough to be upright because we knew we wanted our visitors to be able to see him from every angle.
1324000	1326000	So there's a pole up through his body.
1326000	1334000	One interesting fact that not a lot of people know is that Gary actually placed one of his own eyelashes on our replica.
1335000	1338000	You're probably not going to be able to see it, but let's go take a look.
1343000	1347000	Butsy had an eyelash still attached to his right eye, so it's on our left.
1349000	1353000	And Gary, to make this as realistic as possible, placed one of his own on the model.
1353000	1355000	So there's a piece of the artist.
1359000	1364000	One thing a lot of people want to know is why he's in this weird position, almost like he's dabbing.
1365000	1374000	Well, we know that when he died, he probably fell face first, and we'll talk about his cause of death in a minute.
1375000	1383000	We also know that at some point after his death, the glacier that he was buried under actually moved, and it moved him as well.
1384000	1386000	And that's why he wound up in that odd position.
1387000	1392000	It's why his ears look kind of flat on the edges, and his lip and his nose are kind of mushed.
1394000	1397000	But I think he looks pretty good for someone who's over 5,000 years old.
1399000	1403000	So what else can we learn about him just from looking at his body?
1405000	1407000	I don't know if you've had a chance to look at his hands.
1408000	1410000	Most of his fingernails had fallen out.
1411000	1412000	I think there was one still attached.
1413000	1416000	Fingernails can actually tell us a lot about someone.
1417000	1421000	So it turns out that a few of his fingernails had ridges on them.
1422000	1425000	Now, my fingernails have ridges, vertical ridges that go up and down.
1426000	1433000	But some of his nails actually were found around his body, and they had sideways or horizontal ridges on them.
1434000	1437000	So those indicate that his fingernails stopped growing for periods of time,
1438000	1443000	and that usually happens during periods of great stress or sickness.
1444000	1453000	So we know that based on these lines that there were at least three times over the last year of his life that he was under great stress or not well.
1454000	1458000	We do know he had a case of whipworm because whipworm eggs were found inside him.
1459000	1460000	Maybe it was that.
1461000	1462000	But we know that he had some other ailments as well.
1462000	1464000	We'll get to them in a minute.
1465000	1470000	What else about his body could we look at to identify or learn anything more about him?
1471000	1473000	His teeth are pretty interesting.
1474000	1475000	I don't know if you had a look at his teeth.
1477000	1479000	I don't think he brushed his teeth.
1480000	1482000	They look pretty flat also.
1483000	1484000	Why do you think his teeth would be so flat?
1487000	1489000	I think it had to do with his diet.
1489000	1494000	We know that in his diet there was a lot of stone ground wheat,
1495000	1497000	and we'll talk about how we know that in a moment.
1498000	1500000	But that probably did a lot of damage to his teeth.
1501000	1505000	By the way, how old was he when he died?
1506000	1508000	And how would we ever figure that out?
1509000	1511000	So we know he was buried under the ice for 5,300 years.
1512000	1513000	But what was his age?
1513000	1519000	Well it turns out you can actually figure out someone's age by looking closely at their bones.
1520000	1524000	So his body actually told us by looking at special bone cells
1525000	1528000	that he was almost 46 years of age when he died.
1529000	1530000	Is that very old?
1531000	1532000	It doesn't sound so old to me anymore.
1534000	1535000	It's not that old.
1536000	1538000	But think about when he lived.
1539000	1542000	Over 5,000 years ago, that was pretty old.
1543000	1549000	So we've got a pretty old gentleman up in the mountains carrying 60 pounds worth of stuff.
1550000	1553000	That's pretty much half his body weight, maybe even more.
1554000	1558000	We think maybe he was a shaman or someone of stature in his community.
1559000	1560000	Why was he up on the mountain?
1561000	1563000	There are theories that maybe he was on the run.
1564000	1566000	We'll talk about those theories in a bit.
1567000	1568000	Let's go back to his body.
1569000	1571000	Another really, really cool thing on his body is his tattoos.
1571000	1573000	Come around the back side. They're easier to see.
1574000	1576000	Yes, he has lots of tattoos.
1578000	1581000	His tattoos are not like the tattoos people get today.
1582000	1584000	If you watch Ink Master or anything like that.
1585000	1586000	Look closely by his spine.
1587000	1588000	There's a big patch of them that are easy to see.
1589000	1590000	They're lines.
1591000	1592000	Most of his tattoos are little groupings of lines.
1593000	1594000	Or they're crisscrosses.
1595000	1600000	There's a good crisscross down on his knee, which is visible.
1601000	1602000	He had over 60 tattoos.
1603000	1605000	Each line counts as a tattoo.
1606000	1609000	So there's a large grouping of them along his spine.
1610000	1612000	Another grouping by his hip on his back side.
1613000	1619000	His knee along his calves, ankles, wrists, ribs.
1620000	1624000	I'll be honest, I've never been able to find every tattoo, but they are all here.
1625000	1629000	Why would he have all these tattoos and how did they even make tattoos back then?
1629000	1634000	Well, to make the tattoo, all they had to do was make an opening in the skin
1635000	1637000	and rub charcoal and water in the opening.
1638000	1640000	That's why they all have that kind of blackish-purple color.
1641000	1647000	And the placement of the tattoos is an indicator or a clue as to why he might have the tattoos.
1648000	1653000	They're all on places where there are joints or movement or flex points.
1654000	1658000	And a lot of these placements correspond actually to acupuncture points.
1659000	1661000	That acupuncture is still used today.
1662000	1666000	So acupuncture is the treatment of pressure points to relieve pain.
1667000	1672000	So it's been speculated that his tattoos might have been used like a very early form of acupuncture
1673000	1676000	to relieve pain on these flex points or joints.
1677000	1678000	Why would he have pain in his joints?
1679000	1682000	Well, he did have a lot of wear in his joints.
1683000	1685000	So he was 46 years old, which was quite old.
1685000	1689000	He probably lived a very hard life moving around in the mountains.
1690000	1691000	It would make sense for him to have wear in his joints.
1692000	1694000	And there's another reason why he might have had pain in his joints.
1695000	1699000	Turns out the bacteria that caused Lyme disease were found inside him.
1700000	1705000	So there was extensive analysis of his microbiome, all of the bacteria that he carried around before he died.
1706000	1709000	And Lyme disease bacteria were found.
1709000	1712000	And also the bacteria that caused peptic ulcers.
1713000	1717000	Ulcers of the stomach were found in his stomach, H. pylori.
1718000	1723000	So he actually had some bacterial diseases that people today still have.
1724000	1729000	In fact, I think he's the oldest known documented case of a human with Lyme disease.
1730000	1733000	He also had some bacteria that we all have today in our mouths.
1734000	1735000	So we looked at his teeth.
1736000	1737000	He had gum disease, gingivitis.
1737000	1739000	He had those bacteria too.
1740000	1746000	In addition to looking at the bacteria inside him though, there's been extensive analysis of his DNA.
1747000	1754000	Because his tissues were so well preserved, scientists have been able to isolate his whole genome, all the DNA from his cells,
1755000	1758000	and compare his genes, his DNA, to the DNA we have today.
1759000	1762000	And we know a few interesting things about him from looking at his DNA.
1762000	1766000	We have confirmed that he probably had brown hair and brown eyes.
1767000	1769000	His hair was found at the scene, but it had fallen out.
1770000	1775000	We confirmed that he had type O blood, which is still very common today.
1776000	1781000	We confirmed that he was lactose intolerant, which actually is not a surprise,
1782000	1787000	because to this day about 65% of all humans are lactose intolerant, a very common trait.
1788000	1792000	We also know that he had heart disease, and we know that in two ways.
1793000	1794000	So I'm going to come around here.
1795000	1800000	We can't see his heart, but analysis of his heart showed hardening of his arteries.
1801000	1803000	There was fat deposits around his heart.
1804000	1806000	That's a sign of coronary heart disease.
1807000	1812000	And he also had a variation in his DNA that's associated with that disease in humans today.
1812000	1817000	So you might be wondering, I know I have someone in my family with heart disease,
1818000	1821000	and one of the main things the doctor says is this is caused by your diet.
1822000	1825000	You need to remove fat, high fat foods from your diet.
1826000	1833000	Was his diet like the western diet we eat today, full of fatty foods, McDonald's, things like that?
1834000	1836000	Do we even know what his diet was?
1837000	1838000	I'm pretty sure it wasn't McDonald's.
1838000	1847000	We do know what he was eating though, because don't forget, his whole digestive system was still there, completely freeze-dried,
1848000	1852000	and all the meals he ate before he died were also inside him.
1853000	1854000	Are you wondering what he was eating?
1855000	1856000	I can tell you, follow me.
1857000	1867000	So analysis of the contents of his digestive system have revealed that he ate several meals over the last 36 hours of his life.
1868000	1873000	So those meals traveled through his digestive system, and when he died, they stopped moving.
1874000	1885000	So if a meal was found at the very bottom of the digestive system in the large intestine, that's something he probably ate 36 hours ago or a little bit after.
1886000	1893000	And then as we move up through the digestive system, through the small intestines and then to the stomach, those are more recent meals.
1894000	1900000	So we can figure out not only what he ate, but about when he ate those things. Amazing.
1901000	1908000	So it looks like approximately 14 to 55 hours before he died, which is a big span,
1909000	1915000	but the movement of food through that bottom part of the digestive system varies and can also be affected by things like stress.
1916000	1917000	It can slow things down.
1918000	1919000	What did he eat?
1919000	1923000	Well, it looks like in that meal, he was eating ibex. Do you know what that is?
1924000	1925000	It's like a mountain goat.
1926000	1927000	He was eating some ibex meat.
1928000	1931000	Meal two, which was a little bit later.
1932000	1935000	He ate some legumes, so it was more plant-based this meal.
1936000	1938000	And he ate some primrose and some pollen.
1939000	1943000	The pollen he ate is kingcup pollen, which does have some medicinal properties,
1944000	1947000	and people today still purchase and consume kingcup pollen.
1949000	1954000	He also ate red deer a little bit later on, some leafy greens. Sounds pretty healthy to me.
1955000	1959000	His last meal was ibex again, some berries and herbs.
1960000	1961000	So overall, it looks like a pretty healthy diet.
1962000	1967000	I will point out that the meal that was found in his stomach was a pretty big meal.
1968000	1972000	So probably an hour or two before he died, he sat down and had a big meal.
1973000	1977000	So there's a theory that maybe he was in the mountains on the run being chased.
1977000	1982000	If you were being chased through the mountains, would you sit down and eat a two pound meal?
1983000	1985000	I don't know that I would.
1986000	1990000	So finding that food in his stomach was a game changer.
1991000	1995000	It made scientists think that maybe his story was different than they had originally expected.
1996000	2001000	I'm going to get back to the DNA though, because there's two other interesting DNA stories to tell.
2002000	2003000	And I can tell you them right here.
2003000	2007000	So we know about the bacteria that were inside him.
2008000	2012000	We know about his heart disease. We know about his lactose intolerance.
2013000	2018000	But there were two different DNA types analyzed that are often used by scientists to trace ancestry.
2019000	2023000	One's called mitochondrial DNA and one is called Y chromosome DNA.
2024000	2026000	Mitochondrial DNA is inherited maternally.
2027000	2028000	So it's passed from mother to child.
2029000	2032000	And if that child is a daughter, she'll pass it on as well.
2033000	2037000	It stays intact and as it's passed from one generation to the next.
2038000	2041000	So as a result, it's very useful in tracing lineages.
2042000	2044000	So his mitochondrial DNA was typed.
2045000	2050000	And the mitochondrial DNA type he has is still present in Europe.
2051000	2057000	What I've read is about 10% of people in Europe share what we call his K mitochondrial haplotype.
2058000	2061000	But his subtype of K is very, very rare.
2062000	2066000	He also had a specific Y chromosome haplotype.
2067000	2070000	And the Y chromosome is special because it's passed from father to son.
2071000	2072000	The whole chromosome all at once.
2073000	2079000	So again, because it's passed from father to son and it's not mixing with mom's DNA, it's used to trace lineages.
2080000	2085000	And his Y chromosome DNA still exists in Italy, his type.
2085000	2091000	But believe it or not, it exists on a couple of islands off the coast of Italy.
2092000	2098000	So there's a map here that shows these two little islands, Corsica and Sardinia.
2099000	2104000	Why would there only be people here who have that same Y chromosome DNA as Uzi?
2105000	2112000	Well, it turns out that there have been movements of people from the Middle East into places like Europe.
2112000	2114000	So this is Italy here. It looks like a boot.
2115000	2120000	So we know that about 8,000 years ago there were people farming in the Middle East.
2121000	2126000	And those farmers started to move from the Middle East and populate parts of Europe.
2127000	2128000	And you can see that here.
2129000	2135000	So farming we think started here and farmers started to migrate to other parts of the world.
2135000	2143000	So Uzi represents probably these people who were migrating in and were settling in parts of Europe and farming.
2145000	2152000	We know that after these settlements began, less than 5,000 years ago, there was another influx of people into this part of the world.
2153000	2157000	And that probably when that happened, they were invaders.
2158000	2159000	There were wars.
2159000	2164000	Probably a lot of people died as these invaders were coming in from the East.
2165000	2176000	My guess, in fact, scientists have speculated this, is that people migrated from the mainland in Italy, where Uzi's people were, and they went out to the islands.
2177000	2179000	It's geographically isolated. It's safe.
2180000	2188000	So his Y chromosome haplotype was preserved on those islands by the people who probably fled and found solace on those islands.
2189000	2196000	It's an amazing story, all told by his DNA and the DNA of others in databases that we can compare him to.
2198000	2202000	So I know that you're all wondering, this is the burning question.
2203000	2206000	Why was he on the mountain? And how did he die?
2207000	2212000	Well, I'll tell you, for about 10 years, no one knew how he died.
2213000	2215000	There was something overlooked.
2216000	2218000	Come this way, I'll show you.
2220000	2231000	About 10 years after he was found, people were scanning CAT scans and X-rays, and they found an arrowhead lodged inside his chest.
2232000	2234000	It hadn't been identified until now.
2235000	2243000	And then when they looked at the mummy, there was a tiny little scar where this arrowhead had entered.
2244000	2246000	What we think is that he was shot from behind.
2249000	2256000	You can see the opening in his skin between his shoulder blade and his shoulder bones up there.
2257000	2258000	Tiny, tiny little wound.
2259000	2262000	He had many wounds, many fresh wounds, some on his hands.
2263000	2270000	It was clear that he had been in some kind of combat situation, at least within the last few days of his dying.
2271000	2275000	But this wound was somewhat overlooked. It looks insignificant.
2275000	2279000	But what we know now is that someone, a sharpshooter, shot him from behind.
2280000	2285000	The arrowhead entered through that little opening and hit a subclavian artery, a major artery.
2286000	2288000	And probably within five minutes, he bled to death.
2289000	2298000	He has a wound on his head that could be from being bludgeoned also, or it could be from him falling forward and bumping his head on a rock, we're not sure.
2299000	2301000	But it looks like the cause of death is an arrow.
2301000	2310000	Interestingly, the shaft of the arrow that entered his shoulder wasn't found anywhere in the area.
2311000	2318000	Maybe he tried to pick it up or he tried to remove it and it snapped off and it got lost at the scene.
2319000	2325000	Maybe the person who shot him removed it to remove any evidence that they were involved in his killing.
2326000	2327000	Why would they shoot him?
2328000	2329000	We don't know.
2329000	2330000	We don't know.
2331000	2333000	So this murder mystery is still unsolved.
2334000	2337000	When I have groups of children in here, I hear lots of interesting theories.
2338000	2350000	So one theory I've heard, pretty common, is that maybe it was a big snowstorm and he was sitting down to eat and he had on his bare fur hat and from the distance he looked like an animal and it was an accident.
2351000	2352000	Possible?
2352000	2353000	Yeah.
2354000	2370000	Maybe because this was during a period of time where civilizations were starting to pop up and maybe people were starting to draw invisible boundary lines, he somehow wound up over one of those boundary lines on someone else's property and he was shot.
2371000	2380000	We may never know, but it's amazing all of the things we actually do know just from his mummified remains and from his belongings.
2381000	2382000	So come on over here.
2383000	2387000	The last thing I want to show you is this picture here.
2388000	2394000	So this was a lent to us, the photograph from the South Tyrol Museum of Archaeology.
2395000	2401000	So they consigned some artists to make a model of what they thought Utsi may have looked like before he died.
2402000	2405000	And a lot of students who come here like to stand next to him.
2406000	2410000	So it turns out this shows him at a height of 5 feet 2 inches.
2411000	2412000	I'm going to stand next to him.
2412000	2413000	I've got my shoes on.
2413000	2414000	I'm 5'5".
2415000	2418000	He was probably a little taller than this in his adult life.
2419000	2424000	We think his body might have shrunken after he died, but he's wearing some of his clothing here.
2425000	2431000	I suspect most of the time in the snowy mountains he had more clothing up here, but I think this is to show his physique.
2431000	2436000	We know he was in very good shape, very little subcutaneous fat on his body.
2437000	2441000	And we do know that he had long hair because as I mentioned his hair was found around him.
2442000	2447000	Now you're invited to come back and join us again tomorrow for another Utsi experience.
2448000	2454000	Now that you know all of these interesting things about his life and his times, maybe you want to know a little bit more.
2454000	2464000	Well we have a lab where you can actually reenact one of the fun analyses that was done to figure out where he was over the last three days of his life.
2465000	2474000	Forensic scientists have been able to use pollen found throughout his digestive system to figure out where he was.
2475000	2476000	Strange, right?
2476000	2481000	You'll learn all about how pollen can be used to identify geographic location.
2481000	2491000	And this interesting information helps us learn a little bit more maybe about why he was in the mountains before he died.
2492000	2500000	Well I hope that you enjoyed our tour and if you have any questions feel free to ask them in the chat or check out our website.
2501000	2506000	We have an exhibit website and I'm sure that you can email us also if you have any questions.
2507000	2508000	Thanks for coming.
2508000	2510000	It was a pleasure to see you again.
2511000	2512000	Thank you.
