10 years after being discovered, scientists examined the mummy of a prehistoric man known as Utsi and found an arrowhead lodged in his chest using CAT scans and X-rays. The arrowhead had likely caused his death by hitting a subclavian artery, leading to rapid bleeding out.

Utsi's body showed signs of recent combat, including fresh wounds on his hands and head. The wound from the arrow was initially overlooked but was identified as the probable cause of death. The arrowhead itself was not found, possibly removed as evidence.

Utsi was approximately 5 feet 2 inches tall and in good physical condition with little subcutaneous fat. A replica of his appearance was created to give a visual representation of how he might have looked.

Forensic analysis using pollen found in Utsi's digestive system helped scientists determine where he had been in the days leading up to his death, potentially providing insight into why he was in the mountains.

Visitors can engage with this fascinating case further by participating in interactive forensic activities at the museum, and resources like the exhibit website are available for those who wish to learn more or ask questions.
