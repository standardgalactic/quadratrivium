00:00.000 --> 00:24.000
Hi! I'm so glad you made it! Come on in!

00:31.000 --> 00:38.000
Welcome to the DNA Learning Center. I'm Amanda, and I'm going to show you around the Our Human Inheritance exhibit. Follow me!

00:42.000 --> 00:54.000
We're going to start with the man of the hour, Otsi the Iceman. This is the world's first replica of Otsi the Iceman, one of the world's most famous mummies.

00:54.000 --> 01:03.000
You might be wondering, how did we know his name? It's a really good question. I'm asked that question very often. If you look up on the wall, you'll see the spelling.

01:04.000 --> 01:18.000
First, he was just the Iceman, because this mummy was found buried in ice. But then came the nickname Otsi, because he was found in the Utsil Alps, which is a range that spans from Austria down into Italy.

01:18.000 --> 01:27.000
In fact, if you look at the wall behind our replica of Otsi the Iceman, that is the actual mountainside where this mummy was recovered.

01:28.000 --> 01:39.000
I'm going to spend some time today telling you a little bit about why this find was so important to our understanding of what life was like for people during the Neolithic.

01:39.000 --> 01:49.000
Which is a period of time that was pretty exciting in the history of humans, when civilizations actually first started to spring up in places like the Middle East and in Europe.

01:50.000 --> 01:53.000
So we're going to start at the very beginning. Follow me over here.

01:54.000 --> 02:01.000
Otsi the Iceman was found in Italy by some hikers who happened to be on vacation.

02:01.000 --> 02:06.000
Now in this picture, the hikers we're seeing are not the hikers who found him.

02:07.000 --> 02:10.000
The hikers who found him were Erika and Helmut Simon.

02:11.000 --> 02:20.000
They were advanced hikers and decided to go on a path that normally hikers did not travel on, and it was a very warm season the summer before.

02:21.000 --> 02:28.000
And that September day in the distance, they saw part of Otsi's head sticking up out of a glacier.

02:28.000 --> 02:34.000
What we're seeing here is more exposure of his body than Erika and Helmut actually saw.

02:35.000 --> 02:37.000
They saw just the top of his head, barely exposed.

02:38.000 --> 02:46.000
From what I've read, they went over because they thought what they saw was a piece of trash, and it turned out it was actually a human head.

02:47.000 --> 02:54.000
Probably a big surprise. I don't know what you would do if that was your find on the mountainside, but I think I'd be terrified.

02:55.000 --> 03:02.000
Well, they went and found the park rangers who confirmed that this did indeed look like the body of a human stuck in the ice.

03:03.000 --> 03:12.000
And everyone was pretty sure this was probably just a poor unfortunate hiker who went missing in the mountains, which apparently is quite common on this range.

03:13.000 --> 03:18.000
So they proceeded to try to remove the body from the ice with drills.

03:18.000 --> 03:25.000
Well, drilling was not a very good idea because Port Otsi's body was damaged. I'll be showing you the damage later.

03:26.000 --> 03:31.000
What they wound up having to do was try to melt the ice around his body, which took several days.

03:32.000 --> 03:38.000
And while they were melting the ice around his body, they started to find some of his belongings, things that he had with him when he died on the mountain.

03:39.000 --> 03:47.000
We have replicas here in our exhibit of his belongings, including his clothing and some of the things he had been carrying with him before he died.

03:49.000 --> 03:59.000
These were pretty clear indicators that it was likely he was not a hiker who had gone missing a few decades prior, but maybe a little more ancient than they originally thought.

04:00.000 --> 04:02.000
I'm going to start with his clothing.

04:03.000 --> 04:07.000
So let's see shoes are a real find.

04:08.000 --> 04:13.000
Some of the finest shoes from this period of time that anthropologists and archaeologists have ever seen.

04:13.000 --> 04:22.000
They may not look very fancy to you, but they were very carefully crafted out of tree bast, which is, I had to look this up, believe it or not,

04:23.000 --> 04:29.000
the material that's under the bark of a tree, somewhat stringy, and it can be used to make very strong netting or roping.

04:30.000 --> 04:39.000
So this is tree bast that was carefully woven together, and that netting held hay all around Otsi's foot.

04:39.000 --> 04:44.000
In fact, one of his shoes was actually still on his foot when they removed his body from the ice.

04:45.000 --> 04:49.000
And then there was on top of this, which we can't see, animal hide holding everything together.

04:50.000 --> 04:55.000
And along the bottom, there were also strips of animal hide, probably to give him traction in the snow.

04:56.000 --> 04:59.000
Pretty well produced shoes.

05:01.000 --> 05:06.000
He had a cloak that was made of grass matting, very carefully woven together.

05:06.000 --> 05:11.000
We think maybe it was a cover for the rain, maybe something that he could lay down on.

05:12.000 --> 05:18.000
His clothing were remnants at this point, made mostly of animal skin.

05:19.000 --> 05:26.000
So he had leggings that covered from his ankles up to his thighs, a loincloth that passed between his legs and attached to his belt,

05:27.000 --> 05:34.000
a coat that was made of a few different colors of animal pelts, so it was maybe high fashion for the time.

05:35.000 --> 05:38.000
And then the bear fur hat.

05:39.000 --> 05:47.000
Most of the things he was wearing were made out of skin from animals like goats or sheep that were domesticated, that humans were keeping on farms.

05:48.000 --> 05:54.000
The bear fur hat, though, is a little bit different, certainly not a domesticated bear, probably a wild bear.

05:55.000 --> 05:59.000
And what we think is that it might have even been a bear that he hunted himself,

05:59.000 --> 06:04.000
and that having this special bear fur hat might have been an item of stature for him.

06:05.000 --> 06:11.000
So right away some of the things he was wearing are telling us a little bit about this mysterious man on the mountain.

06:12.000 --> 06:14.000
Let's look at some of the other artifacts down here.

06:15.000 --> 06:19.000
He was carrying homemade arrows, he had a set of arrows, only two of them were completed.

06:20.000 --> 06:25.000
There were a bunch of uncompleted arrows, and again, a quiver made of animal pelt,

06:25.000 --> 06:31.000
and there was a one strip of wood, I believe it was hazel wood that was used to build the quiver.

06:32.000 --> 06:36.000
The finished arrows were made by two different people.

06:37.000 --> 06:42.000
We think maybe he made one of them, but the other one was probably made by someone else.

06:43.000 --> 06:45.000
Now how could we possibly know that?

06:46.000 --> 06:51.000
It turns out that when the pieces of feather are attached to the wood,

06:51.000 --> 06:58.000
there's string that's folded around the wood in a certain direction, right-handed or left-handed.

06:59.000 --> 07:03.000
And it looks like one of the arrows was strung, there's string up here too by the arrow head,

07:04.000 --> 07:07.000
in a right-handed direction, and the other in a left-handed direction.

07:08.000 --> 07:14.000
Maybe someone made the arrow for him, maybe he found it somewhere, we may never know, but a very interesting tale.

07:15.000 --> 07:20.000
One of the most fantastic things that he was carrying was this axe.

07:21.000 --> 07:23.000
So what's so special about the axe?

07:24.000 --> 07:30.000
The axe is made of a handle that comes from a yew tree, and yew wood is very, very strong,

07:31.000 --> 07:35.000
and does not secrete a lot of sap, that sticky stuff that comes out of wood when you cut it.

07:36.000 --> 07:39.000
So it's good material for a handle, it's not going to get sticky.

07:40.000 --> 07:45.000
But what was really impressive was the metal that was used on this axe, almost 100% copper.

07:46.000 --> 07:50.000
This is important, this tells us a little bit about when he lived.

07:51.000 --> 07:55.000
This is a period of time that you may have heard of called the copper age, which started in the Middle East,

07:56.000 --> 07:59.000
the use of copper to make tools, and moved into Europe.

08:00.000 --> 08:08.000
And the fact that he had a copper axe told us a little bit about maybe when the copper age began in Europe, where he came from.

08:09.000 --> 08:12.000
We'll come back to this, so don't forget, copper, very important.

08:13.000 --> 08:17.000
We think that Utsi the Iceman may have actually smelted this copper himself.

08:17.000 --> 08:23.000
So smelting is when the metal is removed from rock, you have to make it very, very hot.

08:24.000 --> 08:27.000
And when you do this, arsenic is actually released into the air.

08:28.000 --> 08:34.000
And he had high levels of arsenic in his hair that was analyzed after the body was removed from the ice.

08:35.000 --> 08:38.000
And he also had arsenic in his lungs, he had been breathing it.

08:39.000 --> 08:44.000
So this might have been a man who was not just a hunter, but was also a smelter of metal,

08:44.000 --> 08:51.000
and maybe a man of stature in his community, a well-rounded man of many skills.

08:52.000 --> 08:59.000
He had a utility belt also made of animal skin, and in the utility belt, there was a more stone age looking tool made of flint, a little dagger.

09:00.000 --> 09:04.000
That dagger was housed in a small pouch that was also made of bast.

09:05.000 --> 09:10.000
And then this tool is one of my favorites because it looks like a giant crayon, it's called a retoucher.

09:10.000 --> 09:17.000
And this is actually made of lime wood, so he used different wood for different products depending on the qualities of the wood.

09:18.000 --> 09:19.000
I think that's just amazing.

09:20.000 --> 09:24.000
And on the tip, what looks like the point of a crayon is actually a piece of an antler.

09:25.000 --> 09:28.000
Now what do you think this tool could possibly be used for?

09:29.000 --> 09:31.000
It was a mystery to me, I had to do a little bit of research.

09:32.000 --> 09:34.000
Well a retoucher is used to sharpen things.

09:34.000 --> 09:41.000
So that antler was probably used quite often to sharpen and resharpen that flint dagger that he was carrying around with him.

09:42.000 --> 09:45.000
In fact, we know that that dagger had been sharpened many times.

09:46.000 --> 09:47.000
Amazing.

09:48.000 --> 09:54.000
Now in addition to these items, there are some other very interesting things over here that I'd like you to look at.

09:55.000 --> 09:58.000
So these also are recreations of a few other things that Utsi was carrying with him.

09:58.000 --> 10:05.000
And by the way, he was carrying over 60 pounds of stuff on his body.

10:06.000 --> 10:15.000
After everything had been collected from the scene, this was deduced by the scientists who were analyzing the find.

10:16.000 --> 10:18.000
And actually, not everything was found at once.

10:19.000 --> 10:26.000
So some of these items were found in the very beginning in late September and early October in 1991 when the mummy was found.

10:26.000 --> 10:31.000
But there was another expedition months later where several other items were collected.

10:32.000 --> 10:36.000
He was carrying two containers like this made of birch bark.

10:37.000 --> 10:38.000
So I don't know if you've ever seen birch trees.

10:39.000 --> 10:42.000
We used to have a lot of birch trees here on Long Island, but I think that they've died.

10:43.000 --> 10:48.000
Birch bark is white on the outside and flaky.

10:49.000 --> 10:50.000
And it's bendy.

10:51.000 --> 10:52.000
So you can make it into different shapes.

10:52.000 --> 10:56.000
And birch trees also can be used to make material like glue.

10:57.000 --> 11:03.000
So these birch bark containers were carefully sewn and glued together and they were used to carry things.

11:04.000 --> 11:06.000
One of the birch bark containers was completely intact.

11:07.000 --> 11:12.000
I think the other one accidentally was stepped on when the scene was being collected.

11:13.000 --> 11:21.000
In one of the birch bark containers, there were pieces of charcoal, maybe not even charcoal, my apologies, burnt pieces of wood.

11:22.000 --> 11:24.000
There were maple leaves that looked like they had been burned.

11:25.000 --> 11:28.000
And there was a fungus called tinder fungus.

11:29.000 --> 11:32.000
Tinder fungus can actually be used as a fire starter.

11:33.000 --> 11:39.000
And there were little flecks of iron pyrite in the tinder fungus, which probably helped to light it.

11:40.000 --> 11:45.000
So what we think is that Uzi was carrying around the tinder fungus inside his birch bark container.

11:45.000 --> 11:52.000
And it carried a glow and it made it much easier for him to start fires very quickly as he was traveling around the mountains.

11:53.000 --> 11:54.000
Fantastic.

11:55.000 --> 11:58.000
The maple leaves were probably used to insulate the container.

11:59.000 --> 12:06.000
And then in the other birch bark container, he had some other tools and something kind of like a first aid kit, believe it or not.

12:07.000 --> 12:12.000
There was a second fungus called a polypore fungus that actually has medicinal properties.

12:12.000 --> 12:18.000
So here's another clue. Maybe he was a medicine man or a shaman in his community.

12:20.000 --> 12:30.000
He was carrying a fungus that had antibiotic properties, that had styptic properties, which means it can stop bleeding.

12:31.000 --> 12:40.000
And it can also be used to relieve intestinal discomfort, which would have come in handy because it turns out this ice man had a pretty nasty case of whipworm.

12:41.000 --> 12:50.000
He had this tool here, which is a stone disc made of a special kind of marble with tree-bast strings coming off and feathers.

12:51.000 --> 12:57.000
What we think is that maybe that was attached to his belt and was used to carry small prey that he had caught, maybe small birds or rabbits.

12:58.000 --> 12:59.000
They were tied to the strings.

13:00.000 --> 13:10.000
And then in addition, some extra antler pieces and some more homemade bast threading and animal hides used to attach things to his utility belt.

13:11.000 --> 13:12.000
Amazing.

13:13.000 --> 13:21.000
So I'm sure you're all wondering, based on the things he was carrying with him, how old is this man?

13:22.000 --> 13:23.000
Do we think he was a hiker?

13:23.000 --> 13:28.000
I don't think that a hiker 60 years ago would have been carrying around a copper axe.

13:29.000 --> 13:34.000
So everyone knew, after his find, that he was probably much older.

13:35.000 --> 13:38.000
Now, I don't know what you would guess. I'd probably guess maybe he's a few hundred years old.

13:39.000 --> 13:40.000
Well, let's go back to the mummy.

13:43.000 --> 13:45.000
Take a look. He looks pretty old.

13:46.000 --> 13:53.000
A technique called carbon dating was used shortly after he was taken to Austria for his first set of analysis.

13:54.000 --> 14:03.000
And carbon dating revealed, are you ready, that he was 5,300 years old.

14:05.000 --> 14:06.000
Wow.

14:07.000 --> 14:14.000
He lived several hundred years before Stonehenge was built, a few hundred years before there were any big Egyptian pyramids built.

14:15.000 --> 14:16.000
He's old.

14:17.000 --> 14:22.000
So how did his body remain in such good condition?

14:23.000 --> 14:25.000
Well, you may not think it's good condition, but think about it.

14:26.000 --> 14:32.000
Usually when someone dies, what happens to the soft parts of the body, like the skin and the muscle and the organs?

14:34.000 --> 14:35.000
They decompose.

14:36.000 --> 14:39.000
There are microorganisms that will come along and break down all of those soft tissues.

14:40.000 --> 14:43.000
And what would we expect to find 5,000 years later if we're lucky?

14:43.000 --> 14:49.000
Maybe some bones, but his whole body was completely preserved.

14:50.000 --> 14:55.000
So what was different about his body than most average people?

14:56.000 --> 14:57.000
Well, it wasn't what was different about his body.

14:58.000 --> 14:59.000
It's where his body was.

15:00.000 --> 15:08.000
So don't forget, he was found on a mountain over 10,000 feet up in the air above sea level.

15:09.000 --> 15:12.000
I don't know if you've ever been on the top of a mountain, but it can be very cold.

15:13.000 --> 15:14.000
There's dry wind blowing around.

15:15.000 --> 15:22.000
And what scientists think is that within a short period of time after he died, he was probably covered by a layer of snow.

15:23.000 --> 15:25.000
And his tissues started to freeze quite fast.

15:26.000 --> 15:31.000
All the microorganisms that probably would have started to decompose the body died too.

15:32.000 --> 15:39.000
And then over a period of time, that very cold, dry wind wicked the moisture out of his tissues.

15:40.000 --> 15:46.000
All of the water was pulled out and his body pretty much, in essence, was freeze-dried.

15:47.000 --> 15:54.000
He looks a little freeze-dried, but what we can see is his skin still surrounding his body.

15:55.000 --> 15:56.000
And it's not just his skin that's still there.

15:57.000 --> 15:59.000
Inside the skin are all of his organs.

16:00.000 --> 16:03.000
The whole digestive system, the brain, the heart.

16:04.000 --> 16:05.000
So we have a whole human body.

16:06.000 --> 16:10.000
And from that body, there are all kinds of interesting things we can learn.

16:11.000 --> 16:13.000
Now I do want to show you the damage.

16:14.000 --> 16:22.000
So if you come around this side, you'll see there's a large part of his backside missing.

16:23.000 --> 16:26.000
So Utsi did not live with only half a backside.

16:26.000 --> 16:33.000
This is what happened when researchers tried to remove him with pneumatic drills.

16:34.000 --> 16:37.000
His body was quite delicate and they lost a piece.

16:38.000 --> 16:43.000
I was actually asked recently, what did they do with the piece that was removed?

16:44.000 --> 16:45.000
I have no idea.

16:46.000 --> 16:49.000
I would imagine that it traveled to Austria with the rest of his body.

16:50.000 --> 16:55.000
And maybe it was helpful in some of the analysis because they had some tissue that had already been removed from his body.

16:56.000 --> 17:00.000
But what this damage did was it exposed some of his internal organs.

17:01.000 --> 17:04.000
Now, how did this replica get made?

17:05.000 --> 17:08.000
I'm sure already you're thinking, this looks very realistic.

17:09.000 --> 17:11.000
The real mummy is in Italy.

17:12.000 --> 17:16.000
If you wanted to see Utsi the Iceman, you would have to go to a small town called Bolzano, Italy.

17:17.000 --> 17:21.000
And there's a museum there just for him called the South Tyrol Museum of Archaeology.

17:22.000 --> 17:24.000
They keep the mummy in an ice compartment.

17:24.000 --> 17:26.000
You can see him through a porthole.

17:27.000 --> 17:33.000
And every once in a while they have to spray water over his body to keep his tissues in that kind of permanently frozen state.

17:34.000 --> 17:40.000
Our replica though has all the details that you'd be able to see on the real Utsi, the Iceman,

17:41.000 --> 17:47.000
if you were able to take a closer look, including the damage to his body and some other very interesting things.

17:48.000 --> 17:50.000
But what I'd like to do is show you how the mummy was made.

17:50.000 --> 17:57.000
We consigned an artist who specializes in making ancient recreations to make the model for us.

17:58.000 --> 18:04.000
And he relied on a company in Belgium called Materialize, which does 3D printing.

18:05.000 --> 18:11.000
I've never done 3D printing myself, but I know a lot of kids who have done 3D printing at school or who have 3D printers at home.

18:12.000 --> 18:18.000
But imagine the size the 3D printer has to be to make something this big.

18:18.000 --> 18:25.000
Well, it turns out in Belgium, Materialize has one of the world's largest 3D printers.

18:26.000 --> 18:33.000
Now, in order to do the 3D printing, we first needed access to CAT scans of Utsi's body.

18:34.000 --> 18:35.000
Who had those?

18:36.000 --> 18:40.000
Well, our friends at the museum in Bolzano provided those CAT scans for us.

18:41.000 --> 18:44.000
And with CAT scans and modern technology like 3D printing,

18:44.000 --> 18:51.000
we were able to get everything we needed to our artist, Gary Staub, so that he could build this replica for us.

18:52.000 --> 18:53.000
And believe it or not, he's made three of these.

18:54.000 --> 18:55.000
This is the first.

18:56.000 --> 19:02.000
The second was given to the Museum of South Tyrol so that they can use it for a traveling exhibit.

19:03.000 --> 19:11.000
And the third is safe in a box, waiting to be put on exhibit at a DNA learning center that will be opening in Brooklyn in the near future.

19:12.000 --> 19:13.000
But come this way.

19:14.000 --> 19:19.000
I have a clip here that shows how the model was built.

19:20.000 --> 19:22.000
So here we are in the beautiful town of Bolzano, Italy.

19:23.000 --> 19:24.000
It's the very northern tip of Italy.

19:25.000 --> 19:27.000
And there he is, the real Utsi the Iceman.

19:28.000 --> 19:31.000
You'll see everyone's wearing sterile gowns and gloves and masks.

19:32.000 --> 19:39.000
No one wants to contaminate the mummy with their own bacteria for fear that those bacteria could decompose his tissues.

19:39.000 --> 19:47.000
And you saw them spraying water over his body to keep that kind of layer of permafrost and maintain his tissues frozen.

19:48.000 --> 19:56.000
These are pictures of the CAT scans that were lent to us from the South Tyrol Museum of Archaeology and they were sent to materialize in Belgium.

19:57.000 --> 19:59.000
So here is a 3D rendering.

20:00.000 --> 20:02.000
That's exactly what's going to come out of the 3D printer.

20:03.000 --> 20:04.000
Now this is a very long process.

20:05.000 --> 20:06.000
This doesn't happen in an hour.

20:06.000 --> 20:13.000
But what we're going to see is him rising up out of the printer from a liquid bed of resin.

20:14.000 --> 20:15.000
Amazing.

20:16.000 --> 20:18.000
Did you notice he's missing his hands?

20:19.000 --> 20:21.000
It turns out, look, no hands.

20:22.000 --> 20:29.000
When the CAT scans were produced, his hands didn't fit in the tube that they were trying to slide him through to get the scans.

20:30.000 --> 20:36.000
So one of the tasks that our artist was faced with was to create the hands from scratch.

20:37.000 --> 20:46.000
What you're seeing him doing now is taking the resin 3D printed version, which is kind of like a clear plastic, and texturizing it.

20:48.000 --> 20:51.000
His goal ultimately is going to be to make a cast.

20:52.000 --> 20:53.000
And a cast is like a mold.

20:53.000 --> 21:02.000
And the important thing about a cast or a mold is that once you've produced an accurate cast or mold, you can make as many replicas as you want.

21:03.000 --> 21:14.000
So once the head was fastened back on and texturized and he had the hands completed, they started the very long process of creating the cast, which you see before you now.

21:15.000 --> 21:24.000
Many layers are applied and then fiberglass is placed on top and then painted again.

21:25.000 --> 21:33.000
Once the cast was complete, Gary was able to make the final version out of another resin material and other mixed media.

21:34.000 --> 21:37.000
So what we're seeing him doing now is decorating.

21:38.000 --> 21:47.000
He's painting and designing, texturizing, doing all of the things that he needed to do to make this model look as realistic as possible.

21:48.000 --> 21:53.000
There he is working on the wounded area, which was one of the most difficult parts to recreate.

21:56.000 --> 22:03.000
And he had to make it sturdy enough to be upright because we knew we wanted our visitors to be able to see him from every angle.

22:04.000 --> 22:06.000
So there's a pole up through his body.

22:06.000 --> 22:14.000
One interesting fact that not a lot of people know is that Gary actually placed one of his own eyelashes on our replica.

22:15.000 --> 22:18.000
You're probably not going to be able to see it, but let's go take a look.

22:23.000 --> 22:27.000
Butsy had an eyelash still attached to his right eye, so it's on our left.

22:29.000 --> 22:33.000
And Gary, to make this as realistic as possible, placed one of his own on the model.

22:33.000 --> 22:35.000
So there's a piece of the artist.

22:39.000 --> 22:44.000
One thing a lot of people want to know is why he's in this weird position, almost like he's dabbing.

22:45.000 --> 22:54.000
Well, we know that when he died, he probably fell face first, and we'll talk about his cause of death in a minute.

22:55.000 --> 23:03.000
We also know that at some point after his death, the glacier that he was buried under actually moved, and it moved him as well.

23:04.000 --> 23:06.000
And that's why he wound up in that odd position.

23:07.000 --> 23:12.000
It's why his ears look kind of flat on the edges, and his lip and his nose are kind of mushed.

23:14.000 --> 23:17.000
But I think he looks pretty good for someone who's over 5,000 years old.

23:19.000 --> 23:23.000
So what else can we learn about him just from looking at his body?

23:25.000 --> 23:27.000
I don't know if you've had a chance to look at his hands.

23:28.000 --> 23:30.000
Most of his fingernails had fallen out.

23:31.000 --> 23:32.000
I think there was one still attached.

23:33.000 --> 23:36.000
Fingernails can actually tell us a lot about someone.

23:37.000 --> 23:41.000
So it turns out that a few of his fingernails had ridges on them.

23:42.000 --> 23:45.000
Now, my fingernails have ridges, vertical ridges that go up and down.

23:46.000 --> 23:53.000
But some of his nails actually were found around his body, and they had sideways or horizontal ridges on them.

23:54.000 --> 23:57.000
So those indicate that his fingernails stopped growing for periods of time,

23:58.000 --> 24:03.000
and that usually happens during periods of great stress or sickness.

24:04.000 --> 24:13.000
So we know that based on these lines that there were at least three times over the last year of his life that he was under great stress or not well.

24:14.000 --> 24:18.000
We do know he had a case of whipworm because whipworm eggs were found inside him.

24:19.000 --> 24:20.000
Maybe it was that.

24:21.000 --> 24:22.000
But we know that he had some other ailments as well.

24:22.000 --> 24:24.000
We'll get to them in a minute.

24:25.000 --> 24:30.000
What else about his body could we look at to identify or learn anything more about him?

24:31.000 --> 24:33.000
His teeth are pretty interesting.

24:34.000 --> 24:35.000
I don't know if you had a look at his teeth.

24:37.000 --> 24:39.000
I don't think he brushed his teeth.

24:40.000 --> 24:42.000
They look pretty flat also.

24:43.000 --> 24:44.000
Why do you think his teeth would be so flat?

24:47.000 --> 24:49.000
I think it had to do with his diet.

24:49.000 --> 24:54.000
We know that in his diet there was a lot of stone ground wheat,

24:55.000 --> 24:57.000
and we'll talk about how we know that in a moment.

24:58.000 --> 25:00.000
But that probably did a lot of damage to his teeth.

25:01.000 --> 25:05.000
By the way, how old was he when he died?

25:06.000 --> 25:08.000
And how would we ever figure that out?

25:09.000 --> 25:11.000
So we know he was buried under the ice for 5,300 years.

25:12.000 --> 25:13.000
But what was his age?

25:13.000 --> 25:19.000
Well it turns out you can actually figure out someone's age by looking closely at their bones.

25:20.000 --> 25:24.000
So his body actually told us by looking at special bone cells

25:25.000 --> 25:28.000
that he was almost 46 years of age when he died.

25:29.000 --> 25:30.000
Is that very old?

25:31.000 --> 25:32.000
It doesn't sound so old to me anymore.

25:34.000 --> 25:35.000
It's not that old.

25:36.000 --> 25:38.000
But think about when he lived.

25:39.000 --> 25:42.000
Over 5,000 years ago, that was pretty old.

25:43.000 --> 25:49.000
So we've got a pretty old gentleman up in the mountains carrying 60 pounds worth of stuff.

25:50.000 --> 25:53.000
That's pretty much half his body weight, maybe even more.

25:54.000 --> 25:58.000
We think maybe he was a shaman or someone of stature in his community.

25:59.000 --> 26:00.000
Why was he up on the mountain?

26:01.000 --> 26:03.000
There are theories that maybe he was on the run.

26:04.000 --> 26:06.000
We'll talk about those theories in a bit.

26:07.000 --> 26:08.000
Let's go back to his body.

26:09.000 --> 26:11.000
Another really, really cool thing on his body is his tattoos.

26:11.000 --> 26:13.000
Come around the back side. They're easier to see.

26:14.000 --> 26:16.000
Yes, he has lots of tattoos.

26:18.000 --> 26:21.000
His tattoos are not like the tattoos people get today.

26:22.000 --> 26:24.000
If you watch Ink Master or anything like that.

26:25.000 --> 26:26.000
Look closely by his spine.

26:27.000 --> 26:28.000
There's a big patch of them that are easy to see.

26:29.000 --> 26:30.000
They're lines.

26:31.000 --> 26:32.000
Most of his tattoos are little groupings of lines.

26:33.000 --> 26:34.000
Or they're crisscrosses.

26:35.000 --> 26:40.000
There's a good crisscross down on his knee, which is visible.

26:41.000 --> 26:42.000
He had over 60 tattoos.

26:43.000 --> 26:45.000
Each line counts as a tattoo.

26:46.000 --> 26:49.000
So there's a large grouping of them along his spine.

26:50.000 --> 26:52.000
Another grouping by his hip on his back side.

26:53.000 --> 26:59.000
His knee along his calves, ankles, wrists, ribs.

27:00.000 --> 27:04.000
I'll be honest, I've never been able to find every tattoo, but they are all here.

27:05.000 --> 27:09.000
Why would he have all these tattoos and how did they even make tattoos back then?

27:09.000 --> 27:14.000
Well, to make the tattoo, all they had to do was make an opening in the skin

27:15.000 --> 27:17.000
and rub charcoal and water in the opening.

27:18.000 --> 27:20.000
That's why they all have that kind of blackish-purple color.

27:21.000 --> 27:27.000
And the placement of the tattoos is an indicator or a clue as to why he might have the tattoos.

27:28.000 --> 27:33.000
They're all on places where there are joints or movement or flex points.

27:34.000 --> 27:38.000
And a lot of these placements correspond actually to acupuncture points.

27:39.000 --> 27:41.000
That acupuncture is still used today.

27:42.000 --> 27:46.000
So acupuncture is the treatment of pressure points to relieve pain.

27:47.000 --> 27:52.000
So it's been speculated that his tattoos might have been used like a very early form of acupuncture

27:53.000 --> 27:56.000
to relieve pain on these flex points or joints.

27:57.000 --> 27:58.000
Why would he have pain in his joints?

27:59.000 --> 28:02.000
Well, he did have a lot of wear in his joints.

28:03.000 --> 28:05.000
So he was 46 years old, which was quite old.

28:05.000 --> 28:09.000
He probably lived a very hard life moving around in the mountains.

28:10.000 --> 28:11.000
It would make sense for him to have wear in his joints.

28:12.000 --> 28:14.000
And there's another reason why he might have had pain in his joints.

28:15.000 --> 28:19.000
Turns out the bacteria that caused Lyme disease were found inside him.

28:20.000 --> 28:25.000
So there was extensive analysis of his microbiome, all of the bacteria that he carried around before he died.

28:26.000 --> 28:29.000
And Lyme disease bacteria were found.

28:29.000 --> 28:32.000
And also the bacteria that caused peptic ulcers.

28:33.000 --> 28:37.000
Ulcers of the stomach were found in his stomach, H. pylori.

28:38.000 --> 28:43.000
So he actually had some bacterial diseases that people today still have.

28:44.000 --> 28:49.000
In fact, I think he's the oldest known documented case of a human with Lyme disease.

28:50.000 --> 28:53.000
He also had some bacteria that we all have today in our mouths.

28:54.000 --> 28:55.000
So we looked at his teeth.

28:56.000 --> 28:57.000
He had gum disease, gingivitis.

28:57.000 --> 28:59.000
He had those bacteria too.

29:00.000 --> 29:06.000
In addition to looking at the bacteria inside him though, there's been extensive analysis of his DNA.

29:07.000 --> 29:14.000
Because his tissues were so well preserved, scientists have been able to isolate his whole genome, all the DNA from his cells,

29:15.000 --> 29:18.000
and compare his genes, his DNA, to the DNA we have today.

29:19.000 --> 29:22.000
And we know a few interesting things about him from looking at his DNA.

29:22.000 --> 29:26.000
We have confirmed that he probably had brown hair and brown eyes.

29:27.000 --> 29:29.000
His hair was found at the scene, but it had fallen out.

29:30.000 --> 29:35.000
We confirmed that he had type O blood, which is still very common today.

29:36.000 --> 29:41.000
We confirmed that he was lactose intolerant, which actually is not a surprise,

29:42.000 --> 29:47.000
because to this day about 65% of all humans are lactose intolerant, a very common trait.

29:48.000 --> 29:52.000
We also know that he had heart disease, and we know that in two ways.

29:53.000 --> 29:54.000
So I'm going to come around here.

29:55.000 --> 30:00.000
We can't see his heart, but analysis of his heart showed hardening of his arteries.

30:01.000 --> 30:03.000
There was fat deposits around his heart.

30:04.000 --> 30:06.000
That's a sign of coronary heart disease.

30:07.000 --> 30:12.000
And he also had a variation in his DNA that's associated with that disease in humans today.

30:12.000 --> 30:17.000
So you might be wondering, I know I have someone in my family with heart disease,

30:18.000 --> 30:21.000
and one of the main things the doctor says is this is caused by your diet.

30:22.000 --> 30:25.000
You need to remove fat, high fat foods from your diet.

30:26.000 --> 30:33.000
Was his diet like the western diet we eat today, full of fatty foods, McDonald's, things like that?

30:34.000 --> 30:36.000
Do we even know what his diet was?

30:37.000 --> 30:38.000
I'm pretty sure it wasn't McDonald's.

30:38.000 --> 30:47.000
We do know what he was eating though, because don't forget, his whole digestive system was still there, completely freeze-dried,

30:48.000 --> 30:52.000
and all the meals he ate before he died were also inside him.

30:53.000 --> 30:54.000
Are you wondering what he was eating?

30:55.000 --> 30:56.000
I can tell you, follow me.

30:57.000 --> 31:07.000
So analysis of the contents of his digestive system have revealed that he ate several meals over the last 36 hours of his life.

31:08.000 --> 31:13.000
So those meals traveled through his digestive system, and when he died, they stopped moving.

31:14.000 --> 31:25.000
So if a meal was found at the very bottom of the digestive system in the large intestine, that's something he probably ate 36 hours ago or a little bit after.

31:26.000 --> 31:33.000
And then as we move up through the digestive system, through the small intestines and then to the stomach, those are more recent meals.

31:34.000 --> 31:40.000
So we can figure out not only what he ate, but about when he ate those things. Amazing.

31:41.000 --> 31:48.000
So it looks like approximately 14 to 55 hours before he died, which is a big span,

31:49.000 --> 31:55.000
but the movement of food through that bottom part of the digestive system varies and can also be affected by things like stress.

31:56.000 --> 31:57.000
It can slow things down.

31:58.000 --> 31:59.000
What did he eat?

31:59.000 --> 32:03.000
Well, it looks like in that meal, he was eating ibex. Do you know what that is?

32:04.000 --> 32:05.000
It's like a mountain goat.

32:06.000 --> 32:07.000
He was eating some ibex meat.

32:08.000 --> 32:11.000
Meal two, which was a little bit later.

32:12.000 --> 32:15.000
He ate some legumes, so it was more plant-based this meal.

32:16.000 --> 32:18.000
And he ate some primrose and some pollen.

32:19.000 --> 32:23.000
The pollen he ate is kingcup pollen, which does have some medicinal properties,

32:24.000 --> 32:27.000
and people today still purchase and consume kingcup pollen.

32:29.000 --> 32:34.000
He also ate red deer a little bit later on, some leafy greens. Sounds pretty healthy to me.

32:35.000 --> 32:39.000
His last meal was ibex again, some berries and herbs.

32:40.000 --> 32:41.000
So overall, it looks like a pretty healthy diet.

32:42.000 --> 32:47.000
I will point out that the meal that was found in his stomach was a pretty big meal.

32:48.000 --> 32:52.000
So probably an hour or two before he died, he sat down and had a big meal.

32:53.000 --> 32:57.000
So there's a theory that maybe he was in the mountains on the run being chased.

32:57.000 --> 33:02.000
If you were being chased through the mountains, would you sit down and eat a two pound meal?

33:03.000 --> 33:05.000
I don't know that I would.

33:06.000 --> 33:10.000
So finding that food in his stomach was a game changer.

33:11.000 --> 33:15.000
It made scientists think that maybe his story was different than they had originally expected.

33:16.000 --> 33:21.000
I'm going to get back to the DNA though, because there's two other interesting DNA stories to tell.

33:22.000 --> 33:23.000
And I can tell you them right here.

33:23.000 --> 33:27.000
So we know about the bacteria that were inside him.

33:28.000 --> 33:32.000
We know about his heart disease. We know about his lactose intolerance.

33:33.000 --> 33:38.000
But there were two different DNA types analyzed that are often used by scientists to trace ancestry.

33:39.000 --> 33:43.000
One's called mitochondrial DNA and one is called Y chromosome DNA.

33:44.000 --> 33:46.000
Mitochondrial DNA is inherited maternally.

33:47.000 --> 33:48.000
So it's passed from mother to child.

33:49.000 --> 33:52.000
And if that child is a daughter, she'll pass it on as well.

33:53.000 --> 33:57.000
It stays intact and as it's passed from one generation to the next.

33:58.000 --> 34:01.000
So as a result, it's very useful in tracing lineages.

34:02.000 --> 34:04.000
So his mitochondrial DNA was typed.

34:05.000 --> 34:10.000
And the mitochondrial DNA type he has is still present in Europe.

34:11.000 --> 34:17.000
What I've read is about 10% of people in Europe share what we call his K mitochondrial haplotype.

34:18.000 --> 34:21.000
But his subtype of K is very, very rare.

34:22.000 --> 34:26.000
He also had a specific Y chromosome haplotype.

34:27.000 --> 34:30.000
And the Y chromosome is special because it's passed from father to son.

34:31.000 --> 34:32.000
The whole chromosome all at once.

34:33.000 --> 34:39.000
So again, because it's passed from father to son and it's not mixing with mom's DNA, it's used to trace lineages.

34:40.000 --> 34:45.000
And his Y chromosome DNA still exists in Italy, his type.

34:45.000 --> 34:51.000
But believe it or not, it exists on a couple of islands off the coast of Italy.

34:52.000 --> 34:58.000
So there's a map here that shows these two little islands, Corsica and Sardinia.

34:59.000 --> 35:04.000
Why would there only be people here who have that same Y chromosome DNA as Uzi?

35:05.000 --> 35:12.000
Well, it turns out that there have been movements of people from the Middle East into places like Europe.

35:12.000 --> 35:14.000
So this is Italy here. It looks like a boot.

35:15.000 --> 35:20.000
So we know that about 8,000 years ago there were people farming in the Middle East.

35:21.000 --> 35:26.000
And those farmers started to move from the Middle East and populate parts of Europe.

35:27.000 --> 35:28.000
And you can see that here.

35:29.000 --> 35:35.000
So farming we think started here and farmers started to migrate to other parts of the world.

35:35.000 --> 35:43.000
So Uzi represents probably these people who were migrating in and were settling in parts of Europe and farming.

35:45.000 --> 35:52.000
We know that after these settlements began, less than 5,000 years ago, there was another influx of people into this part of the world.

35:53.000 --> 35:57.000
And that probably when that happened, they were invaders.

35:58.000 --> 35:59.000
There were wars.

35:59.000 --> 36:04.000
Probably a lot of people died as these invaders were coming in from the East.

36:05.000 --> 36:16.000
My guess, in fact, scientists have speculated this, is that people migrated from the mainland in Italy, where Uzi's people were, and they went out to the islands.

36:17.000 --> 36:19.000
It's geographically isolated. It's safe.

36:20.000 --> 36:28.000
So his Y chromosome haplotype was preserved on those islands by the people who probably fled and found solace on those islands.

36:29.000 --> 36:36.000
It's an amazing story, all told by his DNA and the DNA of others in databases that we can compare him to.

36:38.000 --> 36:42.000
So I know that you're all wondering, this is the burning question.

36:43.000 --> 36:46.000
Why was he on the mountain? And how did he die?

36:47.000 --> 36:52.000
Well, I'll tell you, for about 10 years, no one knew how he died.

36:53.000 --> 36:55.000
There was something overlooked.

36:56.000 --> 36:58.000
Come this way, I'll show you.

37:00.000 --> 37:11.000
About 10 years after he was found, people were scanning CAT scans and X-rays, and they found an arrowhead lodged inside his chest.

37:12.000 --> 37:14.000
It hadn't been identified until now.

37:15.000 --> 37:23.000
And then when they looked at the mummy, there was a tiny little scar where this arrowhead had entered.

37:24.000 --> 37:26.000
What we think is that he was shot from behind.

37:29.000 --> 37:36.000
You can see the opening in his skin between his shoulder blade and his shoulder bones up there.

37:37.000 --> 37:38.000
Tiny, tiny little wound.

37:39.000 --> 37:42.000
He had many wounds, many fresh wounds, some on his hands.

37:43.000 --> 37:50.000
It was clear that he had been in some kind of combat situation, at least within the last few days of his dying.

37:51.000 --> 37:55.000
But this wound was somewhat overlooked. It looks insignificant.

37:55.000 --> 37:59.000
But what we know now is that someone, a sharpshooter, shot him from behind.

38:00.000 --> 38:05.000
The arrowhead entered through that little opening and hit a subclavian artery, a major artery.

38:06.000 --> 38:08.000
And probably within five minutes, he bled to death.

38:09.000 --> 38:18.000
He has a wound on his head that could be from being bludgeoned also, or it could be from him falling forward and bumping his head on a rock, we're not sure.

38:19.000 --> 38:21.000
But it looks like the cause of death is an arrow.

38:21.000 --> 38:30.000
Interestingly, the shaft of the arrow that entered his shoulder wasn't found anywhere in the area.

38:31.000 --> 38:38.000
Maybe he tried to pick it up or he tried to remove it and it snapped off and it got lost at the scene.

38:39.000 --> 38:45.000
Maybe the person who shot him removed it to remove any evidence that they were involved in his killing.

38:46.000 --> 38:47.000
Why would they shoot him?

38:48.000 --> 38:49.000
We don't know.

38:49.000 --> 38:50.000
We don't know.

38:51.000 --> 38:53.000
So this murder mystery is still unsolved.

38:54.000 --> 38:57.000
When I have groups of children in here, I hear lots of interesting theories.

38:58.000 --> 39:10.000
So one theory I've heard, pretty common, is that maybe it was a big snowstorm and he was sitting down to eat and he had on his bare fur hat and from the distance he looked like an animal and it was an accident.

39:11.000 --> 39:12.000
Possible?

39:12.000 --> 39:13.000
Yeah.

39:14.000 --> 39:30.000
Maybe because this was during a period of time where civilizations were starting to pop up and maybe people were starting to draw invisible boundary lines, he somehow wound up over one of those boundary lines on someone else's property and he was shot.

39:31.000 --> 39:40.000
We may never know, but it's amazing all of the things we actually do know just from his mummified remains and from his belongings.

39:41.000 --> 39:42.000
So come on over here.

39:43.000 --> 39:47.000
The last thing I want to show you is this picture here.

39:48.000 --> 39:54.000
So this was a lent to us, the photograph from the South Tyrol Museum of Archaeology.

39:55.000 --> 40:01.000
So they consigned some artists to make a model of what they thought Utsi may have looked like before he died.

40:02.000 --> 40:05.000
And a lot of students who come here like to stand next to him.

40:06.000 --> 40:10.000
So it turns out this shows him at a height of 5 feet 2 inches.

40:11.000 --> 40:12.000
I'm going to stand next to him.

40:12.000 --> 40:13.000
I've got my shoes on.

40:13.000 --> 40:14.000
I'm 5'5".

40:15.000 --> 40:18.000
He was probably a little taller than this in his adult life.

40:19.000 --> 40:24.000
We think his body might have shrunken after he died, but he's wearing some of his clothing here.

40:25.000 --> 40:31.000
I suspect most of the time in the snowy mountains he had more clothing up here, but I think this is to show his physique.

40:31.000 --> 40:36.000
We know he was in very good shape, very little subcutaneous fat on his body.

40:37.000 --> 40:41.000
And we do know that he had long hair because as I mentioned his hair was found around him.

40:42.000 --> 40:47.000
Now you're invited to come back and join us again tomorrow for another Utsi experience.

40:48.000 --> 40:54.000
Now that you know all of these interesting things about his life and his times, maybe you want to know a little bit more.

40:54.000 --> 41:04.000
Well we have a lab where you can actually reenact one of the fun analyses that was done to figure out where he was over the last three days of his life.

41:05.000 --> 41:14.000
Forensic scientists have been able to use pollen found throughout his digestive system to figure out where he was.

41:15.000 --> 41:16.000
Strange, right?

41:16.000 --> 41:21.000
You'll learn all about how pollen can be used to identify geographic location.

41:21.000 --> 41:31.000
And this interesting information helps us learn a little bit more maybe about why he was in the mountains before he died.

41:32.000 --> 41:40.000
Well I hope that you enjoyed our tour and if you have any questions feel free to ask them in the chat or check out our website.

41:41.000 --> 41:46.000
We have an exhibit website and I'm sure that you can email us also if you have any questions.

41:47.000 --> 41:48.000
Thanks for coming.

41:48.000 --> 41:50.000
It was a pleasure to see you again.

41:51.000 --> 41:52.000
Thank you.
