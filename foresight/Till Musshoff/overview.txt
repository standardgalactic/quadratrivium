1. **Digital Literacy as a Skill**: The ability to effectively use computers is a powerful skill that can significantly enhance one's capabilities, much like literacy did in the past. It allows individuals to learn new software quickly, understand the existence and function of various tools, and efficiently navigate and utilize information from the digital world.

2. **Computers as 'Bicycles for the Mind'**: Computers amplify human abilities and allow us to achieve more than we could on our own. They are particularly powerful tools that are still evolving. The potential of computers is immense, especially considering we're only at the beginning of their capabilities.

3. **Learning New Skills**: If one is already proficient with some computer programs, learning new ones becomes easier and faster due to the transferable skills and knowledge gained from previous experiences. This creates a virtuous cycle of learning, where a broad skill set facilitates the acquisition of new skills more rapidly.

4. **The Renaissance Mindset**: Being digitally literate is akin to being a modern-day Renaissance personâ€”someone who is versatile and skilled across various domains. This versatility allows for greater flexibility in career paths and the ability to adapt quickly to changes or new interests.

5. **Career Flexibility**: Digital literacy makes it easier to change careers, as one can quickly learn the necessary skills for a new field. It also provides the means to monetize diverse skill sets.

It's a tool that amplifies human capabilities, and like the bicycle did for physical movement, the computer does for cognitive tasks. Embracing this skill set and continually expanding it can lead to a more flexible and fulfilling career, as well as the ability to pivot quickly into new areas of interest or expertise.
