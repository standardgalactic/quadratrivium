Checking University of Oxford/3.3 The Problem of Induction.txt
1. David Hume presents a sceptical challenge regarding induction, questioning whether our inductive reasoning is justified. He argues that there is no logical basis for inferring generalizations from particular instances, as our justification for expecting the future to resemble the past is empirical and not rational.

2. Hume's skepticism about induction has profound implications for science, as it relies on inductive reasoning to draw conclusions about unobserved phenomena.

3. Responses to Hume's challenge can be categorized into several approaches:
   - Justification by demonstration or pure reason (unsuccessful according to Hume).
   - Justification through probability, which acknowledges that induction is not certain but likely.
   - Analytic justification, claiming that rationality inherently includes the practice of induction.
   - Pragmatic justification, asserting that induction works well in practice, so we should continue to use it.

4. Hume himself advocates for relying on induction despite its lack of a justification by pure reason, as we have no choice but to assume that the future will resemble the past.

5. The debate over the justification of induction remains open, with no fully satisfactory resolution. Philosophers like Simon Blackburn, John Mackey, Roy Harrod, Peter Strawson, and Nelson Goodman have contributed to this discussion.

6. Ultimately, Hume's challenge leads to the recognition that the principles underlying science are often accepted without a rational justification; we simply accept them as given. This is especially true in quantum mechanics, where the fundamental principles cannot be derived from simpler concepts.

7. The course will continue with more topics on general philosophy, and students should consider the readings provided, including works by Humella and Nelson Goodman, to deepen their understanding of these issues.
