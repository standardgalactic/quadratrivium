0	4480	Let me begin my introduction to group theory by telling you about my first encounter with
4480	5880	group theory.
5880	10480	There is a famous problem in computer science called the graph isomorphism problem.
10480	14200	Given two graphs, decide whether one can be transformed into the other.
14200	17520	For example, these two here might look different on first glance, but watch how they are just
17520	20060	reshaped versions of one another.
20060	22100	How about these two?
22100	25520	Probably not the same, since one has a crossing while the other one doesn't.
25520	29240	Well, turns out they are the same, despite the crossing.
29240	32720	So here's an example where they have to be different, simply because one has five nodes
32720	35040	while the other one has only two.
35040	37640	But most problem settings are not that easy.
37640	40160	Try to see if you can solve this one.
40160	44240	There is a straightforward algorithm to decide whether two graphs are the same.
44240	47080	Just brute force all possible node positions.
47080	52120	If one possibility works, good, but if none of them work, they truly have to be different.
52120	55720	But there are exponentially many possibilities, so this takes a lot of time.
55720	60280	We would prefer a faster and cleverer algorithm, preferably one that has a sub-exponential
60280	61880	runtime.
61880	65600	Research into this problem took off in the 80s, but it took roughly four decades until
65600	70440	Professor Laszlo Babaay found the first such algorithm in 2015.
70440	75000	His result was a massive achievement, so when I saw that Babaay gave a talk explaining his
75000	77400	algorithm, naturally I wanted to check it out.
77400	81880	But before he even started with this explanation, already in the introduction, he came with
81880	86760	a group theory introduced into the subject.
86760	87760	Group theory?
87760	88760	Really?
88760	92960	I didn't know any group theory, I'm a computer scientist, not a mathematician.
92960	96960	But even though I only uploaded three videos so far, you guys already know that I would
96960	101700	do anything for a nice algorithm, even if this means that I'd have to learn group theory.
101700	103720	So that's what I did.
103720	108080	And my god, you cannot imagine what techniques the mathematicians have kept secrets from us
108080	109680	all this time.
109680	113840	There is this whole field called abstract algebra that basically no one has ever heard
113840	117280	of but is absolutely essential in higher math.
117280	122520	You have to understand, we all start at school learning to count using the natural numbers.
122520	127240	Later we learn that there are also negative numbers, so we get introduced to the integers.
127240	132640	Then we run into the problem that we can't exactly divide 3 by 2, so we encounter fractions.
132640	137320	And finally we learn that there exist irrational numbers like the square root of 2, which cannot
137320	139160	be described as a fraction.
139160	143320	So in the end, they tell you that the so-called real numbers are the ultimate number system
143320	146960	and that you can find every number you'll ever need in your life somewhere on the real
146960	148560	number line.
148560	151280	And that's where the school curriculum ends for most of us.
151280	155440	But you might have heard that in the 16th century, some Italians started to use the
155440	159560	square root of minus 1, something that cannot be found on the number line, but that lives
159560	161320	somewhere outside it.
161320	164280	They had their reasons for doing so, which we're not going into.
164280	167720	But the point is that they slowly realized that with this, they invented a new number
167720	171680	system that they thought was useless in real life, and yet works better than anything that
171680	173720	ever seemed before.
173720	177360	With time, mathematicians tore down more and more of the tradition that the real numbers
177360	181840	are the ultimate system, and they started inventing new number systems left and right.
181840	186800	Some number systems you probably never even knew existed, like the Hamiltonians, finite
186800	189160	fields, and the pediatrics.
189160	194560	The mathematical landscape exploded in variety, and with so many number systems out there,
194560	198800	mathematicians searched for an abstract, unifying theory, a set of rules that governs all these
198800	201560	systems and that captures their behavior.
201560	203760	But what kind of rules would make sense?
203760	208360	How do we know that our theory accurately describes all these number systems?
208360	211840	This is a very tough question to answer.
211840	216400	Mathematicians tried several different sets of rules, always retrying and refining.
216400	220520	And while the names for these abstractions certainly could have needed some improvements,
220520	224920	over the decades of work, certain rules started to crystallize, certain rules that they could
224920	227200	agree simply make the most sense.
227200	231760	One particularly simple but nonetheless powerful theory that started to manifest is the theory
231760	233720	of groups.
233720	237240	Groups are powerful enough to describe the most various things.
237240	241760	They were originally invented for the very specific purpose of analyzing permutations
241760	246960	of roots of a polynomial, but were later used from a common problem such as number theory,
246960	251040	geometry, physics, and making young men go nuts.
251040	255520	In fact, four out of the seven millennium price problems, you know, those problems where
255520	260400	you win a million dollars for solving any of them, use groups in their definition.
260400	264880	But despite their sheer power, groups are so easy to get into that I decided to make
264880	275040	a series on them, starting with this video.
275040	276960	So what is a group?
276960	281320	A group is a collection of elements, can be whatever, numbers, or any other mathematical
281320	284200	objects you desire to get with one operation.
284200	289040	Again, can be whatever, addition, multiplication, or something completely different.
289040	292520	They just have to satisfy these four axioms.
292520	294680	Let's go through them.
294680	296640	The first one is called closure.
296640	300800	It says that the operation takes any two group elements and gives you another element of
300800	301800	the group.
302160	303160	That's it.
303160	306920	Seems pretty anticlimactic, but I mean calculating two things together is something we do all
306920	311440	the time, so at least this shows how groups are supposed to be an abstract generalization
311440	315000	of, you know, most math things.
315000	319400	But the important part is that the math thing the group describes is a closed system, hence
319400	323160	the name closure, in the sense that since the result is again part of the group, you
323160	327840	can continue to operate group elements onto it, which brings me to the next axiom.
327840	331360	The associativity we all know from addition and multiplication.
331360	335440	Formally, it says that when operating three elements together, whether you first operate
335440	340880	A and B, or first operate B and C, the result in the end is the same.
340880	344680	In practice, this means that we can just write everything without parentheses, because there's
344680	348000	no ambiguity about the order in which you calculate.
348000	350760	The next two rules are a bit more interesting, though.
350760	355080	The third rule says that every group contains a so-called neutral element, an element commonly
355080	360200	denoted by E, that when operated with any other element, leaves it B, no matter from
360200	363080	which side this happens.
363080	367120	So it's like an abstract generalization of adding a zero.
367120	369360	Just a remark for the English-speaking people?
369360	373800	For you it's more common to call it the identity element, and it's the French, the Germans,
373800	377960	the Italians, and pretty much anyone else that calls it the neutral element.
377960	382380	In my humble opinion, neutral makes more sense, especially if you're new to group theory,
382380	385400	so that's what we're going to roll with from now on.
385400	390060	And the final rule says that every element has a corresponding so-called inverse element,
390060	393100	always denoted with a minus one index exponent.
393100	397600	The inverse element, when operated on the original, annihilates both elements and returns
397600	399860	the neutral element.
399860	401740	Let me justify the name inverse.
401740	407340	Let's say we start with A and operate B and C and D onto it.
407340	412740	If you now want to revert all those operations, you just apply the respective inverses.
412740	417300	First the inverse of D gives with D itself the neutral element, and the neutral element
417300	419220	vanishes anyway.
419220	423920	Likewise we can apply the inverse of C, which with C gives again the neutral element, which
423920	426020	vanishes too.
426020	430500	And now the inverse of B, you already know that they cancel, I'm not even gonna bother
430500	432660	to animate the whole ordeal.
432660	434500	But look, we're back at A.
434500	440140	So the inverses, as their name suggests, reverted all previous operations.
440140	443580	Also the notation for the inverse has a sensible purpose.
443580	448580	In group theory it is legal and even very common to abbreviate A operated on A operated
448580	453640	on A operated on A, simply as A to the 4, as you know it from multiplication.
453640	457900	When you now operate the inverse of A to A to the 4, think about what happens behind
457900	459840	the scenes.
459840	463980	The inverse cancels one of the A's and we're left with three A's.
463980	468500	So essentially A to the minus one subtracted one from the exponent, which is pretty much
468500	471380	what the notation indicates it would do.
471380	475420	But yeah, any mathematical structure that satisfies these four axioms gets the privilege
475420	476940	of being a group.
476940	479980	You're probably curious by now what such a group could look like, so it's time for
479980	486220	some examples.
486220	491860	The integers, denoted with a Z, with addition as the operation form a group.
492180	498120	Indeed closure is satisfied as you can always add any two integers and get another integer.
498120	502660	And we all know that addition is associative, which again means that order doesn't matter
502660	507820	and that is reflected in the fact that we usually don't write down parentheses.
507820	511400	Already in the definition of groups, I've hinted that zero is the neutral element, as
511400	515740	indeed zero added to the any number is that same number, no matter if it's added from
515740	518420	the right or the left.
518420	522340	And for the last rule to hold, we just need to show that every integer has an inverse,
522340	525700	which added together returns the neutral element.
525700	528860	That would be its negative, so all conditions are met.
528860	529860	Very well.
529860	535020	On the other hand, the integers with multiplication as the operation do not form a group.
535020	537540	I mean let's check the axioms.
537540	543860	Closure is satisfied because multiplying two integers gives another integer.
543860	546260	Associativity is also satisfied.
546260	552500	The neutral element is now one, as multiplying by one leaves any element be.
552500	555540	But it's the last rule that is not satisfied.
555540	560540	For it to be satisfied, we would need to be able to get from any element back to one.
560540	564780	But to get, let's say, from four to one, we would need to multiply by a quarter, which
564780	568100	is not an integer and doesn't exist in this domain.
568100	573660	So not all rules are satisfied and this system does not get the privilege of being a group.
573660	581340	But this hints that the rationals on their multiplication do form a group.
581340	586220	If we allow not only whole numbers, but also rational numbers, which are denoted by a queue,
586220	590220	then the first three rules hold as discussed, but now for any number, the inverse is its
590220	591220	reciprocal.
591220	595060	Except, there's one hipster that has no reciprocal.
595060	599860	So it is customary to exclude zero, which makes it so that all axioms are indeed satisfied
599860	603060	and we therefore have another example for a group.
603060	606500	We have a problem though, because if you check the four axioms, you'll realize that
606500	609860	the rationals also form a group under addition.
609860	613700	To differentiate between these two groups, one adds a respective operation symbol to
613700	617900	each group and it's expected from good group theories to know that the group where we multiply
617900	621420	is all the rationals except zero.
621420	625140	All three groups we've looked at so far have infinitely many elements.
625140	628940	How many elements a group has is called the order of the group and is written with these
628940	630540	two bars.
630540	635580	And in the early days of group theory, groups commonly only had finitely many elements.
635580	642580	So let's look at some finite examples.
642580	647460	The cyclic group, denoted by the n, is actually a whole family of groups, because the n denotes
647460	651260	just a placeholder for any positive integer of your choice.
651260	653260	Here I'll choose six.
653260	657260	Then C6 behaves pretty much as the ordinary integers would do, in a sense that we start
657260	664100	at zero and repeatedly adding one gives one, two, three, four, five, but when we get to
664100	667380	six, we wrap around and start again at zero.
667380	670740	This cycling back around is where the name cyclic comes from.
670740	675260	So in this group, three plus three does not equal six, but it cycles back to zero.
675260	680180	Similarly, four plus five would usually give nine, but since we cycle back at six, seven
680180	685980	equals one, eight equals two, and finally nine actually equals three.
686220	690340	Apart from the fact that the cyclic group has finite order, C6 has six elements, and
690340	694580	Cn has n elements, not much has changed compared to the integers.
694580	699980	The system is still closed, addition is associative, and adding zero doesn't affect the result.
699980	704100	It's just that now the inverse of, let's say, one is not minus one, since that doesn't
704100	706220	exist, but five.
706220	708260	And the inverse of two is four.
708260	714700	For three it's three, for four it's two, for five it's one, and for zero it's zero itself.
714700	721820	And from zero, in general in Cn, the inverse of a number a is n minus a.
721820	725660	In all four groups, we've looked at so far the elements commute, meaning that a operated
725660	728820	on b is the same as b operated on a.
728820	733300	But be careful, even though the circle looks and feels like a multiplication symbol, it
733300	734460	is not.
734460	737060	There is no rule that says that they should commute.
737060	741180	So I want to introduce one final example, in which the elements do not commute.
745540	749580	The dihedral group, or short the n, works as follows.
749580	751740	Choose any regular polygon.
751740	754060	Here I'm going to choose the hexagon.
754060	758740	The dihedral group, since I've chosen a six-sided polygon written here as d6, is the different
758740	762820	ways to transform space such that the hexagon stays in place.
762820	766020	There are six rotations that do exactly that.
766020	780900	A full 360 rotation transforms space in the same way that a zero-degree rotation would,
780900	783220	so it's not counted as a new element.
783220	786420	But we can also flip the hexagon.
786420	791900	And combining the flip with the rotations gives us six more elements.
791900	796260	And if you think about it, the hexagon only has 12 possible configurations it can be in,
796260	800020	so these 12 elements are already all the transformations.
800020	804060	By the same reasoning, we see that the order of dn, the group of transformations for an
804060	809980	n-sided polygon, is 2 times n, again n rotations and n flipped rotations.
809980	813060	The operation of this group is the chaining of these transformations.
813060	818660	For example, chaining a 60-degree with a 240-degree rotation gives you a 300-degree rotation.
818660	822220	And you know, we could verify that this makes a group.
822220	827580	Anyway, what I'm going to demonstrate here is that the order of elements does matter.
827580	833420	For a given hexagon, if we flip it and then rotate it by 60 degrees, we get this transformation.
833420	838260	But if we rotate it first and then flip it, then we get a different transformation.
838260	842860	In general, a flip in a rotation is not the same as a rotation on the flip.
842860	847260	The former obviously gives a flipped rotation, and the latter turns out here equals a flipped
847260	851820	300-degree rotation.
851820	855820	So now we've seen five examples of groups, but the power of group theory does not come
855820	859180	to fruition by looking at groups one by one individually.
859180	862660	The whole point is that when you prove theorems for the abstract concept of a group, they
862660	865700	automatically hold for all instances of groups.
865700	871100	So it's time we prove theorems the way it's done in group theory.
871100	874740	First of all, I would like to justify the name of the neutral element.
874740	878100	I talk about the neutral element as if there was a unique one, but couldn't it be that
878100	880660	a group contains several neutral elements?
880660	882620	It turns out that this is not so.
882620	886500	Suppose that there were the neutral elements e1 and e2.
886500	889380	What would happen if we operated them together?
889380	893940	On one hand, since e2 is a neutral element, this equals e1.
893940	900020	On the other hand, since e1 is a neutral element, this also equals e2 at the same time.
900020	903300	This is only possible if e1 equals e2.
903300	907580	By the laws of mathematics, if two things equal each other, they are the same thing,
907580	912340	so instead of two separate neutral elements, a group always has only one.
912340	914540	Let's prove another theorem similarly.
914540	919780	By definition, every element has an inverse, but that means that also the inverse has an
919780	920780	inverse.
920780	924620	Let's again just operate all these elements together and see what happens.
924620	930100	On one hand, a and the inverse of a cancel, so this equals the inverse of the inverse.
930100	935100	On the other hand, the inverse and its inverse cancel, leaving a.
935100	938820	So this means that the inverse of the inverse is just the original.
938820	944940	This is just like how the negative of negative 3 is just 3, except abstract.
944940	947100	But do you realize what this means?
947100	950380	Have you wondered why the neutral element has to be neutral from both sides, but the
950380	953020	inverse only needs to invert from the right?
953020	956940	It turns out that we don't need to assume left-sided cancellation as an axiom, because
956940	960820	not only can we prove that, but we just did that if you think about it.
960820	964660	The group axioms only allows to cancel inverses from the right.
964660	970500	But a is an inverse, namely the inverse of the inverse, so this is perfectly legal.
970500	974860	Now that I say it, maybe I should also justify the name of the inverse.
974860	978500	I talk about the inverse element as if there was a unique one, but could it be that an
978500	980540	element has several inverses?
980540	982740	Again, there's not.
982740	986220	Let's assume there were a second inverse and let me operate it from the left to both
986220	988940	sides of the definition of the inverse.
988940	992820	How fortunate that we've just proven that inverses also cancel from the left, so we
992820	994220	can simplify.
994220	999420	Again, by the loss of mathematics, we see that the second inverse is just the original inverse,
999420	1002380	so inverses are always unique.
1002380	1006980	This fact is really convenient, because it allows us to upgrade our notation.
1006980	1008580	What is this object?
1008580	1012340	We know that inverses are written with a minus 1 index exponent and squares are written
1012340	1014100	with a 2 index exponent.
1014100	1015100	But this?
1015180	1017660	There are two possibilities that come to mind.
1017660	1022460	It could be the square of the inverse, or it could be the inverse of the square.
1022460	1026340	Well, it turns out that those two ideas are actually the same.
1026340	1028660	Both objects invert a squared.
1028660	1033100	I mean, per definition, the inverse of a squared inverts a squared.
1033100	1037860	But watch, so does twice the inverse.
1037860	1041460	Since we've just shown that there can be only one inverse, there's no difference between
1041460	1045820	them, and it is customary to write that object as a to the minus 2.
1045820	1049940	This is just like how there's no difference between 3 plus 3 negated and 3 negated plus
1049940	1053940	3 negated, both objects are denoted by minus 6.
1053940	1057620	The same reasoning extends to any negative power, but let's stop here.
1057620	1061180	I've already proven 5 theorems in such a short time.
1061180	1065740	Again, the uniqueness of the neutral element, that the inverse of the inverse is the original,
1065740	1070260	that inverses also cancel from the left, the uniqueness of inverses, and finally, the inverse
1070260	1073420	of the square is the square of the inverse.
1073420	1077880	But if you too want to have a try at proving such theorems, I can give you this challenge.
1077880	1081260	The group axioms I have given you are not the weakest ones.
1081260	1085860	You can actually remove left-sided neutrality, and yet the definition of groups is unchanged
1085860	1089660	in the sense that we can prove left-sided neutrality as a theorem.
1089660	1091940	So go ahead and try to do exactly that.
1091940	1095380	I didn't want to work with these weaker axioms here, since that would just double the length
1095380	1099940	of our proofs without gaining that much more insight.
1099940	1103580	We're at a point where I feel like I need to justify myself.
1103580	1107300	These theorems are supposed to uncover the hidden structure of mathematics, but when I
1107300	1111380	talk about how the fact that negating the negation and taking the reciprocal off the
1111380	1115460	reciprocal both gave me back the original is just an instance of this underlying theorem
1115460	1119700	on inverses of inverses, it just makes me feel like a nut job rambling about how all
1119700	1123220	number systems are secretly ruled through group theory.
1123220	1126780	But what's the point of proving abstract theorems if we never get something concrete
1126780	1127780	out of it?
1127900	1131700	It's time we studied big picture in group theory to see where this is all going, and
1131700	1134540	prove our first big theorem along the way.
1134540	1138380	And what better way is there to study groups than with more groups?
1143580	1147620	A subgroup is as part of the group that also happens to be a group itself.
1147620	1151380	For example the even integers are a subgroup of the integers.
1151380	1156580	Even though they are just a subset of the integers, they still satisfy all four axioms.
1156580	1158700	Let's for example check the last one.
1158700	1163780	The inverse axiom is satisfied since every number indeed has an inverse.
1163780	1167660	On the other hand, the odd integers do not form a group because they don't even satisfy
1167660	1170740	the very first rule, the closure axiom.
1170740	1175220	An odd integer added to an odd integer gives an even integer, which is outside the domain
1175220	1179540	of odd integers, so they do not form a closed system.
1179540	1183420	As another example, D6 also has subgroups.
1183420	1187300	For example it's intuitively clear that the rotations do form a closed system, since
1187300	1191820	a rotation and a rotation gives you another rotation, and proving that they indeed are
1191820	1194660	a subgroup is just routine.
1194660	1199180	D3, the symmetries of a triangle, is also a subgroup of D6.
1199180	1202700	But if you think about it, that makes sense, as any transformation that is valid for the
1202700	1206940	triangle is also valid for the hexagon.
1206940	1212140	And as a final example, in Z9 there's a subgroup of 0,3,6.
1212140	1215660	I again don't want to prove now that this is a subgroup, because I think it's again
1215660	1219500	intuitively clear that this is at least a closed system.
1219500	1223300	All elements are multiples of 3, and if the only thing you can do is move around with
1223300	1227180	multiples of 3, you're obviously going to be locked into this system.
1227180	1230340	There's nothing really much else to say about subgroups.
1230340	1235140	I could bombard you with 10 more examples of subgroups, but I think they're very intuitive.
1235140	1239740	So instead I'd rather explore why our intuition works so well, why locking yourself into a
1239740	1242900	closed system gives you a subgroup.
1242900	1247140	Just how the subgroup of rotations can be expressed as multiples of the 6th degree rotation,
1247140	1251860	and the 0,3,6 subgroup can be expressed as multiples of 3, in general for any element
1251860	1256340	a, the so called subgroup generated by a is defined as the multiples of a, which are
1256340	1260340	just a, a squared, a cubed, and so on.
1260340	1264580	This system is obviously closed, since operating a power of a with another power of a gives
1264580	1266700	you again a power of a.
1266700	1270740	I claim though that for finite groups this is indeed a subgroup, even though it looks
1270740	1274020	like the neutral element and inverses are missing.
1274020	1277500	But let's look at what happens in a finite group when we keep on generating powers of
1277500	1281500	a.
1281500	1285740	At some point we simply run out of elements, and sooner or later we have no choice but
1285740	1289580	to generate the neutral element as a power of a.
1289580	1293940	After that this process runs into a cycle, since if a to the a returns to e, then a to
1293940	1296860	the 9 is just a again, and so on.
1296860	1299860	And it's not hard to see that we now get inverses for free.
1299860	1304860	If a to the 8 equals e, the inverse of a is just its own 7th power.
1304860	1308620	Just one thing that I'd like to clarify is why the cycle has to return to the neutral
1308620	1313180	element before repeating, because why couldn't a to the 8 go straight to a?
1313180	1317940	Well if a to the 8 equals a, then cancelling an a from both sides, we see that already
1317940	1320500	a to the 7 got to the neutral element.
1320500	1325220	So in this sense you cannot avoid the neutral element, so the proof works out.
1325220	1329460	Remember though that this works only for finite groups, because it can fail horribly for infinite
1329460	1330460	groups.
1330460	1334620	Trying to express the subgroup of even integers as a subgroup generated by 2 will generate
1334620	1339780	only positive multiples of 2, completely missing 0 and the inverses.
1339780	1343980	In such a case, to make this a subgroup, one makes life easy, and includes the neutral
1343980	1349860	and the inverse elements in the definition of the subgroup generated by a anyway.
1349860	1351880	But again, only if needed.
1351880	1355460	So to bring my point across, I have a second challenge for you.
1355460	1359020	Find an element in an infinite group whose generated subgroup doesn't need the neutral
1359020	1364300	element or inverses included.
1364300	1368300	With our fancy new notation for subgroups, we have an opportunity to a deeper understanding
1368300	1369300	of groups.
1369300	1373020	It turns out that groups are highly symmetric with respect to their subgroups, and what
1373020	1377040	I mean by highly symmetric is that shifted copies of the subgroup appear all over their
1377040	1378980	place inside a group.
1378980	1383420	In the integers for example, we have the even integers, but also the odd integers, and while
1383420	1387820	we saw that the odd integers are not the group, they are at least a shifted copy of the even
1387820	1391820	integers, where every element is shifted by plus 1.
1391820	1396140	The mathematical term for such a shifted copy of a subgroup is a coset.
1396140	1399780	Again since it's not a group, we wouldn't call it a co-group or something like that,
1399780	1403860	but it is more than just any random set of elements, so at least it has a distinguished
1403860	1405060	name.
1405060	1408980	The coset is then denoted with that shift in front of the subgroup, so here the odd
1408980	1412460	integers are 1 plus the even integers.
1412460	1415900	Note that there is some ambiguity, because we might as well have gotten the odd integers
1415900	1421420	with a shift of 3, so writing the coset as 3 plus the even integers is just as legal.
1421420	1426380	Furthermore, since a shift of 2 or even a shift of 0 gives us the even integers themselves,
1426380	1430220	a group does count as its own coset.
1430220	1433500	We can also find such symmetries in D6.
1433500	1438340	Here we have the rotations, which are a subgroup, and the flipped rotations, which are the rotations
1438340	1441740	shifted by a flipped, and are therefore a coset.
1441740	1445980	You could shift the rotations by a rotation itself, and while that would shuffle the rotations
1445980	1451500	around, the 0 degree to the 60 degree, the 60 degree to the 120 degree, and so on, the
1451500	1454180	subgroup itself would be unaffected.
1454180	1459980	So the dihedral group has this innate symmetry between normal hexagons and the flipped hexagons.
1459980	1462300	But we can take it even further.
1462300	1465820	Let's turn the game around, and instead of starting with the rotations and then shifting
1465820	1470300	with the flip, we start with the flips and shift with the rotations.
1470300	1474340	The subgroup generated by the flip generates just two elements.
1474340	1478300	The flip, and flipping again, brings you back to the neutral element.
1478300	1482900	Shifting that subgroup by 6 degrees gives the 60 degree rotation, and as I've noted
1482900	1486380	before, a flipped 300 degree rotation.
1486380	1489980	Shift by 120 degrees and we get another two element coset.
1489980	1491740	And so on.
1491740	1495660	By the way, we don't need to shift by flips, since that would just again shuffle the elements
1495660	1499420	in the coset around, but not affect the coset itself.
1499420	1503860	In the end, we uncover a new 6-fold symmetry in the dihedral group.
1503860	1507760	This diagram gives us a complete understanding of this excited symmetry, and the two-sided
1507760	1509840	symmetry is also easy to grasp.
1509840	1514120	But what I think is more important is what you're not seeing in these diagrams.
1514120	1517500	Why is it that the group can always be organized so neatly?
1517500	1520820	You know, it could have been that they are the rotations, the flipped rotations, and
1520820	1523100	another weird third coset.
1523100	1524460	But there isn't.
1524460	1529940	Every element appears once and only once in these cosets in a neat and ordered way.
1529940	1532420	Why is that?
1532420	1536660	I promised you that groups are highly symmetric with respect to their subgroups, and here
1536660	1538860	we have a way to quantify that.
1538860	1542780	Let's say we have a group with a subgroup inside it.
1542780	1547420	I want to show that the coset of the subgroups neatly partitioned the group into equally
1547420	1549580	sized fragments.
1549580	1552100	There are two facts that are easy to grasp.
1552100	1555660	The first one is that the cosets cover the whole group, because if you want to cover
1555660	1560180	any specific element, you do what I think is the most obvious idea.
1560180	1563940	Shift by exactly that element.
1563940	1569180	Notice how then the neutral element shifted by x gives exactly x, covering it, along with
1569180	1572980	the other elements in the coset.
1572980	1576380	The other fact is that all cosets are of equal size.
1576980	1580860	Obviously, you don't suddenly get more elements by shifting.
1580860	1583580	But you also don't get less elements.
1583580	1587460	At first, it doesn't seem impossible that you'd lose elements, so to speak, by having
1587460	1589940	two shifts converge the same result.
1589940	1594980	But for any shift, we can also shift back to the origin with the inverse element.
1594980	1598500	Look, notice how the inverse cancels here from the left.
1598500	1601860	I told you our proofs would come in handy at some point.
1601860	1606580	So if you can recover all original elements like this, a coset smaller than the original
1606580	1610340	subgroup would now make the inverse shift suddenly give you more elements, which is
1610340	1611980	also nonsense.
1611980	1616260	No, it only makes sense for all cosets to have the same number of elements as the original
1616260	1620420	subgroup, since each of the elements are in a one-to-one correspondence, by shift in
1620420	1624100	one direction and by the inverse shift in the other direction.
1624100	1628820	The only fact left to discuss that is not at all obvious is that different cosets don't
1628820	1629940	overlap.
1629940	1631740	But let's see.
1631740	1635700	Here you shift by an element that is already in the subgroup.
1635700	1640060	Since the subgroup is a closed system, the results are all in the subgroup.
1640060	1644060	Or you shift by an element that is outside the subgroup.
1644060	1648220	Could it happen that any result is still in the subgroup, for example z times a equals
1648220	1649780	b?
1649780	1654540	Canceling a from both sides and solving for z, we get that z equals b times the inverse
1654540	1656180	of a.
1656180	1660940	But since a is an element of the subgroup, so is the inverse of a.
1660940	1666380	And since b is also an element of the subgroup, so is their product, again because of closure,
1666380	1668820	so z must be 2.
1668820	1673140	If we specifically assume that z is outside the subgroup, the result could have never
1673140	1676180	been in the subgroup in the first place.
1676180	1680620	So we have this dichotomy, where a coset either doesn't overlap with the subgroup at all,
1680620	1683460	or it is the whole subgroup itself.
1683460	1688100	And basically the same argument shows that this dichotomy also holds between cosets, but
1688100	1691100	I won't repeat all the details here.
1691100	1696060	All in all, this proves that the cosets partitioned the whole group into equally sized parts.
1696060	1699980	And for finite groups we can summarize this with a really cool and very easy to remember
1699980	1702980	theorem called Lagrange's theorem.
1702980	1708380	Lagrange's theorem states that for a group g and a subgroup h, the order of h divides
1708380	1710220	the order of g.
1710220	1712140	And we've seen this, right?
1712140	1716780	d6 has 12 elements and the subgroup of rotations has 6.
1716780	1722580	Because we have now rigorously proven that the rotations partition d6, 6 has to divide
1722580	1724180	12.
1724180	1730860	Or if we take a look at the cyclic group with 6 elements, it has subgroups of order 3, 2,
1730860	1731860	and 1.
1731860	1736300	And there cannot be subgroups of order 5 or 4.
1736300	1742340	Fun fact about Lagrange's theorem, Lagrange died before group theory was even invented,
1742340	1745740	makes you wonder how he got his name attached to group theory theorem.
1745740	1748220	Eh, it's complicated.
1748220	1751500	And it's not like abstract algebra is known for good naming.
1751500	1755180	Anyway, so what is this theorem useful for?
1755180	1761140	Can you imagine the consequences this theorem has for a group with prime order p?
1761140	1768180	Since primes can only be divided by 1 and p, a subgroup can only have 1 or p elements.
1768180	1774300	Now, take any element that is not the neutral element, let's call it a, and start generating
1774300	1775980	its subgroup.
1775980	1780740	That subgroup contains more than one element, and therefore has to contain all p elements.
1780740	1785980	So after we eventually reach the neutral element, we will have filled the whole group.
1785980	1790900	This makes it eerily similar to the cyclic group, so here's a trick.
1790900	1794540	Instead of the letter a, what if I use this symbol?
1794540	1799380	And instead of this weird circle operation, what if I write plus?
1799380	1804860	Then a squared becomes 1 plus 1, which we humans write as 2.
1804860	1809540	And a cube becomes 1 plus 1 plus 1, which we encode with this symbol.
1809540	1812740	A to the 4 becomes 4 and so on.
1812740	1816060	And for e, let me use the digit 0.
1816060	1819700	So only through relabeling, we got the cyclic group.
1819700	1824220	But how I write down my group doesn't change anything about the group itself, right?
1824220	1829580	Which means that any group of prime order, no matter how abstract, has to be the cyclic
1829580	1830580	group.
1830580	1833860	When I saw this, I felt like I understood group theory.
1833860	1838420	Yeah, we could spend all of our time with abstract groups, but it is also possible with
1838420	1843060	the sheer structural loan we get from the four axioms and the small size requirement
1843060	1846060	to create very concrete examples.
1846060	1851060	It made me want to go on a quest to uncover the hidden structure of groups of any order.
1851060	1856220	I claim that, with what you've learned in this video, you can guess, maybe even prove,
1856220	1860500	what all the groups of order 6 are, and with the upcoming videos, we'll tackle the problem
1860500	1863140	of uncovering all the groups.
1863140	1867140	Wait a minute, weren't we originally trying to solve the graph isomorphism problem?
