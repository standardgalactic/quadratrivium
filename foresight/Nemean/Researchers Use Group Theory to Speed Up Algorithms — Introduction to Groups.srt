1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,480
Let me begin my introduction to group theory by telling you about my first encounter with

2
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:05,880
group theory.

3
00:00:05,880 --> 00:00:10,480
There is a famous problem in computer science called the graph isomorphism problem.

4
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:14,200
Given two graphs, decide whether one can be transformed into the other.

5
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:17,520
For example, these two here might look different on first glance, but watch how they are just

6
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:20,060
reshaped versions of one another.

7
00:00:20,060 --> 00:00:22,100
How about these two?

8
00:00:22,100 --> 00:00:25,520
Probably not the same, since one has a crossing while the other one doesn't.

9
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:29,240
Well, turns out they are the same, despite the crossing.

10
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:32,720
So here's an example where they have to be different, simply because one has five nodes

11
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:35,040
while the other one has only two.

12
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:37,640
But most problem settings are not that easy.

13
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:40,160
Try to see if you can solve this one.

14
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:44,240
There is a straightforward algorithm to decide whether two graphs are the same.

15
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:47,080
Just brute force all possible node positions.

16
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:52,120
If one possibility works, good, but if none of them work, they truly have to be different.

17
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:55,720
But there are exponentially many possibilities, so this takes a lot of time.

18
00:00:55,720 --> 00:01:00,280
We would prefer a faster and cleverer algorithm, preferably one that has a sub-exponential

19
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:01,880
runtime.

20
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:05,600
Research into this problem took off in the 80s, but it took roughly four decades until

21
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:10,440
Professor Laszlo Babaay found the first such algorithm in 2015.

22
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:15,000
His result was a massive achievement, so when I saw that Babaay gave a talk explaining his

23
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,400
algorithm, naturally I wanted to check it out.

24
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:21,880
But before he even started with this explanation, already in the introduction, he came with

25
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:26,760
a group theory introduced into the subject.

26
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:27,760
Group theory?

27
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:28,760
Really?

28
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:32,960
I didn't know any group theory, I'm a computer scientist, not a mathematician.

29
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:36,960
But even though I only uploaded three videos so far, you guys already know that I would

30
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:41,700
do anything for a nice algorithm, even if this means that I'd have to learn group theory.

31
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:43,720
So that's what I did.

32
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:48,080
And my god, you cannot imagine what techniques the mathematicians have kept secrets from us

33
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:49,680
all this time.

34
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:53,840
There is this whole field called abstract algebra that basically no one has ever heard

35
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:57,280
of but is absolutely essential in higher math.

36
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:02,520
You have to understand, we all start at school learning to count using the natural numbers.

37
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:07,240
Later we learn that there are also negative numbers, so we get introduced to the integers.

38
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:12,640
Then we run into the problem that we can't exactly divide 3 by 2, so we encounter fractions.

39
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:17,320
And finally we learn that there exist irrational numbers like the square root of 2, which cannot

40
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:19,160
be described as a fraction.

41
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:23,320
So in the end, they tell you that the so-called real numbers are the ultimate number system

42
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:26,960
and that you can find every number you'll ever need in your life somewhere on the real

43
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:28,560
number line.

44
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:31,280
And that's where the school curriculum ends for most of us.

45
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:35,440
But you might have heard that in the 16th century, some Italians started to use the

46
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:39,560
square root of minus 1, something that cannot be found on the number line, but that lives

47
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:41,320
somewhere outside it.

48
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:44,280
They had their reasons for doing so, which we're not going into.

49
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:47,720
But the point is that they slowly realized that with this, they invented a new number

50
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:51,680
system that they thought was useless in real life, and yet works better than anything that

51
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:53,720
ever seemed before.

52
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:57,360
With time, mathematicians tore down more and more of the tradition that the real numbers

53
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:01,840
are the ultimate system, and they started inventing new number systems left and right.

54
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:06,800
Some number systems you probably never even knew existed, like the Hamiltonians, finite

55
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:09,160
fields, and the pediatrics.

56
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:14,560
The mathematical landscape exploded in variety, and with so many number systems out there,

57
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:18,800
mathematicians searched for an abstract, unifying theory, a set of rules that governs all these

58
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:21,560
systems and that captures their behavior.

59
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:23,760
But what kind of rules would make sense?

60
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:28,360
How do we know that our theory accurately describes all these number systems?

61
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:31,840
This is a very tough question to answer.

62
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:36,400
Mathematicians tried several different sets of rules, always retrying and refining.

63
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:40,520
And while the names for these abstractions certainly could have needed some improvements,

64
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:44,920
over the decades of work, certain rules started to crystallize, certain rules that they could

65
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:47,200
agree simply make the most sense.

66
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:51,760
One particularly simple but nonetheless powerful theory that started to manifest is the theory

67
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:53,720
of groups.

68
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:57,240
Groups are powerful enough to describe the most various things.

69
00:03:57,240 --> 00:04:01,760
They were originally invented for the very specific purpose of analyzing permutations

70
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:06,960
of roots of a polynomial, but were later used from a common problem such as number theory,

71
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:11,040
geometry, physics, and making young men go nuts.

72
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:15,520
In fact, four out of the seven millennium price problems, you know, those problems where

73
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:20,400
you win a million dollars for solving any of them, use groups in their definition.

74
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:24,880
But despite their sheer power, groups are so easy to get into that I decided to make

75
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:35,040
a series on them, starting with this video.

76
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:36,960
So what is a group?

77
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:41,320
A group is a collection of elements, can be whatever, numbers, or any other mathematical

78
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:44,200
objects you desire to get with one operation.

79
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:49,040
Again, can be whatever, addition, multiplication, or something completely different.

80
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:52,520
They just have to satisfy these four axioms.

81
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:54,680
Let's go through them.

82
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:56,640
The first one is called closure.

83
00:04:56,640 --> 00:05:00,800
It says that the operation takes any two group elements and gives you another element of

84
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:01,800
the group.

85
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:03,160
That's it.

86
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:06,920
Seems pretty anticlimactic, but I mean calculating two things together is something we do all

87
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:11,440
the time, so at least this shows how groups are supposed to be an abstract generalization

88
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:15,000
of, you know, most math things.

89
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:19,400
But the important part is that the math thing the group describes is a closed system, hence

90
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:23,160
the name closure, in the sense that since the result is again part of the group, you

91
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:27,840
can continue to operate group elements onto it, which brings me to the next axiom.

92
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:31,360
The associativity we all know from addition and multiplication.

93
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:35,440
Formally, it says that when operating three elements together, whether you first operate

94
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:40,880
A and B, or first operate B and C, the result in the end is the same.

95
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:44,680
In practice, this means that we can just write everything without parentheses, because there's

96
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:48,000
no ambiguity about the order in which you calculate.

97
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,760
The next two rules are a bit more interesting, though.

98
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:55,080
The third rule says that every group contains a so-called neutral element, an element commonly

99
00:05:55,080 --> 00:06:00,200
denoted by E, that when operated with any other element, leaves it B, no matter from

100
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:03,080
which side this happens.

101
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:07,120
So it's like an abstract generalization of adding a zero.

102
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:09,360
Just a remark for the English-speaking people?

103
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:13,800
For you it's more common to call it the identity element, and it's the French, the Germans,

104
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:17,960
the Italians, and pretty much anyone else that calls it the neutral element.

105
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:22,380
In my humble opinion, neutral makes more sense, especially if you're new to group theory,

106
00:06:22,380 --> 00:06:25,400
so that's what we're going to roll with from now on.

107
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:30,060
And the final rule says that every element has a corresponding so-called inverse element,

108
00:06:30,060 --> 00:06:33,100
always denoted with a minus one index exponent.

109
00:06:33,100 --> 00:06:37,600
The inverse element, when operated on the original, annihilates both elements and returns

110
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:39,860
the neutral element.

111
00:06:39,860 --> 00:06:41,740
Let me justify the name inverse.

112
00:06:41,740 --> 00:06:47,340
Let's say we start with A and operate B and C and D onto it.

113
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:52,740
If you now want to revert all those operations, you just apply the respective inverses.

114
00:06:52,740 --> 00:06:57,300
First the inverse of D gives with D itself the neutral element, and the neutral element

115
00:06:57,300 --> 00:06:59,220
vanishes anyway.

116
00:06:59,220 --> 00:07:03,920
Likewise we can apply the inverse of C, which with C gives again the neutral element, which

117
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:06,020
vanishes too.

118
00:07:06,020 --> 00:07:10,500
And now the inverse of B, you already know that they cancel, I'm not even gonna bother

119
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:12,660
to animate the whole ordeal.

120
00:07:12,660 --> 00:07:14,500
But look, we're back at A.

121
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:20,140
So the inverses, as their name suggests, reverted all previous operations.

122
00:07:20,140 --> 00:07:23,580
Also the notation for the inverse has a sensible purpose.

123
00:07:23,580 --> 00:07:28,580
In group theory it is legal and even very common to abbreviate A operated on A operated

124
00:07:28,580 --> 00:07:33,640
on A operated on A, simply as A to the 4, as you know it from multiplication.

125
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:37,900
When you now operate the inverse of A to A to the 4, think about what happens behind

126
00:07:37,900 --> 00:07:39,840
the scenes.

127
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:43,980
The inverse cancels one of the A's and we're left with three A's.

128
00:07:43,980 --> 00:07:48,500
So essentially A to the minus one subtracted one from the exponent, which is pretty much

129
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:51,380
what the notation indicates it would do.

130
00:07:51,380 --> 00:07:55,420
But yeah, any mathematical structure that satisfies these four axioms gets the privilege

131
00:07:55,420 --> 00:07:56,940
of being a group.

132
00:07:56,940 --> 00:07:59,980
You're probably curious by now what such a group could look like, so it's time for

133
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:06,220
some examples.

134
00:08:06,220 --> 00:08:11,860
The integers, denoted with a Z, with addition as the operation form a group.

135
00:08:12,180 --> 00:08:18,120
Indeed closure is satisfied as you can always add any two integers and get another integer.

136
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:22,660
And we all know that addition is associative, which again means that order doesn't matter

137
00:08:22,660 --> 00:08:27,820
and that is reflected in the fact that we usually don't write down parentheses.

138
00:08:27,820 --> 00:08:31,400
Already in the definition of groups, I've hinted that zero is the neutral element, as

139
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:35,740
indeed zero added to the any number is that same number, no matter if it's added from

140
00:08:35,740 --> 00:08:38,420
the right or the left.

141
00:08:38,420 --> 00:08:42,340
And for the last rule to hold, we just need to show that every integer has an inverse,

142
00:08:42,340 --> 00:08:45,700
which added together returns the neutral element.

143
00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:48,860
That would be its negative, so all conditions are met.

144
00:08:48,860 --> 00:08:49,860
Very well.

145
00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:55,020
On the other hand, the integers with multiplication as the operation do not form a group.

146
00:08:55,020 --> 00:08:57,540
I mean let's check the axioms.

147
00:08:57,540 --> 00:09:03,860
Closure is satisfied because multiplying two integers gives another integer.

148
00:09:03,860 --> 00:09:06,260
Associativity is also satisfied.

149
00:09:06,260 --> 00:09:12,500
The neutral element is now one, as multiplying by one leaves any element be.

150
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:15,540
But it's the last rule that is not satisfied.

151
00:09:15,540 --> 00:09:20,540
For it to be satisfied, we would need to be able to get from any element back to one.

152
00:09:20,540 --> 00:09:24,780
But to get, let's say, from four to one, we would need to multiply by a quarter, which

153
00:09:24,780 --> 00:09:28,100
is not an integer and doesn't exist in this domain.

154
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:33,660
So not all rules are satisfied and this system does not get the privilege of being a group.

155
00:09:33,660 --> 00:09:41,340
But this hints that the rationals on their multiplication do form a group.

156
00:09:41,340 --> 00:09:46,220
If we allow not only whole numbers, but also rational numbers, which are denoted by a queue,

157
00:09:46,220 --> 00:09:50,220
then the first three rules hold as discussed, but now for any number, the inverse is its

158
00:09:50,220 --> 00:09:51,220
reciprocal.

159
00:09:51,220 --> 00:09:55,060
Except, there's one hipster that has no reciprocal.

160
00:09:55,060 --> 00:09:59,860
So it is customary to exclude zero, which makes it so that all axioms are indeed satisfied

161
00:09:59,860 --> 00:10:03,060
and we therefore have another example for a group.

162
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:06,500
We have a problem though, because if you check the four axioms, you'll realize that

163
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:09,860
the rationals also form a group under addition.

164
00:10:09,860 --> 00:10:13,700
To differentiate between these two groups, one adds a respective operation symbol to

165
00:10:13,700 --> 00:10:17,900
each group and it's expected from good group theories to know that the group where we multiply

166
00:10:17,900 --> 00:10:21,420
is all the rationals except zero.

167
00:10:21,420 --> 00:10:25,140
All three groups we've looked at so far have infinitely many elements.

168
00:10:25,140 --> 00:10:28,940
How many elements a group has is called the order of the group and is written with these

169
00:10:28,940 --> 00:10:30,540
two bars.

170
00:10:30,540 --> 00:10:35,580
And in the early days of group theory, groups commonly only had finitely many elements.

171
00:10:35,580 --> 00:10:42,580
So let's look at some finite examples.

172
00:10:42,580 --> 00:10:47,460
The cyclic group, denoted by the n, is actually a whole family of groups, because the n denotes

173
00:10:47,460 --> 00:10:51,260
just a placeholder for any positive integer of your choice.

174
00:10:51,260 --> 00:10:53,260
Here I'll choose six.

175
00:10:53,260 --> 00:10:57,260
Then C6 behaves pretty much as the ordinary integers would do, in a sense that we start

176
00:10:57,260 --> 00:11:04,100
at zero and repeatedly adding one gives one, two, three, four, five, but when we get to

177
00:11:04,100 --> 00:11:07,380
six, we wrap around and start again at zero.

178
00:11:07,380 --> 00:11:10,740
This cycling back around is where the name cyclic comes from.

179
00:11:10,740 --> 00:11:15,260
So in this group, three plus three does not equal six, but it cycles back to zero.

180
00:11:15,260 --> 00:11:20,180
Similarly, four plus five would usually give nine, but since we cycle back at six, seven

181
00:11:20,180 --> 00:11:25,980
equals one, eight equals two, and finally nine actually equals three.

182
00:11:26,220 --> 00:11:30,340
Apart from the fact that the cyclic group has finite order, C6 has six elements, and

183
00:11:30,340 --> 00:11:34,580
Cn has n elements, not much has changed compared to the integers.

184
00:11:34,580 --> 00:11:39,980
The system is still closed, addition is associative, and adding zero doesn't affect the result.

185
00:11:39,980 --> 00:11:44,100
It's just that now the inverse of, let's say, one is not minus one, since that doesn't

186
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:46,220
exist, but five.

187
00:11:46,220 --> 00:11:48,260
And the inverse of two is four.

188
00:11:48,260 --> 00:11:54,700
For three it's three, for four it's two, for five it's one, and for zero it's zero itself.

189
00:11:54,700 --> 00:12:01,820
And from zero, in general in Cn, the inverse of a number a is n minus a.

190
00:12:01,820 --> 00:12:05,660
In all four groups, we've looked at so far the elements commute, meaning that a operated

191
00:12:05,660 --> 00:12:08,820
on b is the same as b operated on a.

192
00:12:08,820 --> 00:12:13,300
But be careful, even though the circle looks and feels like a multiplication symbol, it

193
00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:14,460
is not.

194
00:12:14,460 --> 00:12:17,060
There is no rule that says that they should commute.

195
00:12:17,060 --> 00:12:21,180
So I want to introduce one final example, in which the elements do not commute.

196
00:12:25,540 --> 00:12:29,580
The dihedral group, or short the n, works as follows.

197
00:12:29,580 --> 00:12:31,740
Choose any regular polygon.

198
00:12:31,740 --> 00:12:34,060
Here I'm going to choose the hexagon.

199
00:12:34,060 --> 00:12:38,740
The dihedral group, since I've chosen a six-sided polygon written here as d6, is the different

200
00:12:38,740 --> 00:12:42,820
ways to transform space such that the hexagon stays in place.

201
00:12:42,820 --> 00:12:46,020
There are six rotations that do exactly that.

202
00:12:46,020 --> 00:13:00,900
A full 360 rotation transforms space in the same way that a zero-degree rotation would,

203
00:13:00,900 --> 00:13:03,220
so it's not counted as a new element.

204
00:13:03,220 --> 00:13:06,420
But we can also flip the hexagon.

205
00:13:06,420 --> 00:13:11,900
And combining the flip with the rotations gives us six more elements.

206
00:13:11,900 --> 00:13:16,260
And if you think about it, the hexagon only has 12 possible configurations it can be in,

207
00:13:16,260 --> 00:13:20,020
so these 12 elements are already all the transformations.

208
00:13:20,020 --> 00:13:24,060
By the same reasoning, we see that the order of dn, the group of transformations for an

209
00:13:24,060 --> 00:13:29,980
n-sided polygon, is 2 times n, again n rotations and n flipped rotations.

210
00:13:29,980 --> 00:13:33,060
The operation of this group is the chaining of these transformations.

211
00:13:33,060 --> 00:13:38,660
For example, chaining a 60-degree with a 240-degree rotation gives you a 300-degree rotation.

212
00:13:38,660 --> 00:13:42,220
And you know, we could verify that this makes a group.

213
00:13:42,220 --> 00:13:47,580
Anyway, what I'm going to demonstrate here is that the order of elements does matter.

214
00:13:47,580 --> 00:13:53,420
For a given hexagon, if we flip it and then rotate it by 60 degrees, we get this transformation.

215
00:13:53,420 --> 00:13:58,260
But if we rotate it first and then flip it, then we get a different transformation.

216
00:13:58,260 --> 00:14:02,860
In general, a flip in a rotation is not the same as a rotation on the flip.

217
00:14:02,860 --> 00:14:07,260
The former obviously gives a flipped rotation, and the latter turns out here equals a flipped

218
00:14:07,260 --> 00:14:11,820
300-degree rotation.

219
00:14:11,820 --> 00:14:15,820
So now we've seen five examples of groups, but the power of group theory does not come

220
00:14:15,820 --> 00:14:19,180
to fruition by looking at groups one by one individually.

221
00:14:19,180 --> 00:14:22,660
The whole point is that when you prove theorems for the abstract concept of a group, they

222
00:14:22,660 --> 00:14:25,700
automatically hold for all instances of groups.

223
00:14:25,700 --> 00:14:31,100
So it's time we prove theorems the way it's done in group theory.

224
00:14:31,100 --> 00:14:34,740
First of all, I would like to justify the name of the neutral element.

225
00:14:34,740 --> 00:14:38,100
I talk about the neutral element as if there was a unique one, but couldn't it be that

226
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:40,660
a group contains several neutral elements?

227
00:14:40,660 --> 00:14:42,620
It turns out that this is not so.

228
00:14:42,620 --> 00:14:46,500
Suppose that there were the neutral elements e1 and e2.

229
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:49,380
What would happen if we operated them together?

230
00:14:49,380 --> 00:14:53,940
On one hand, since e2 is a neutral element, this equals e1.

231
00:14:53,940 --> 00:15:00,020
On the other hand, since e1 is a neutral element, this also equals e2 at the same time.

232
00:15:00,020 --> 00:15:03,300
This is only possible if e1 equals e2.

233
00:15:03,300 --> 00:15:07,580
By the laws of mathematics, if two things equal each other, they are the same thing,

234
00:15:07,580 --> 00:15:12,340
so instead of two separate neutral elements, a group always has only one.

235
00:15:12,340 --> 00:15:14,540
Let's prove another theorem similarly.

236
00:15:14,540 --> 00:15:19,780
By definition, every element has an inverse, but that means that also the inverse has an

237
00:15:19,780 --> 00:15:20,780
inverse.

238
00:15:20,780 --> 00:15:24,620
Let's again just operate all these elements together and see what happens.

239
00:15:24,620 --> 00:15:30,100
On one hand, a and the inverse of a cancel, so this equals the inverse of the inverse.

240
00:15:30,100 --> 00:15:35,100
On the other hand, the inverse and its inverse cancel, leaving a.

241
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:38,820
So this means that the inverse of the inverse is just the original.

242
00:15:38,820 --> 00:15:44,940
This is just like how the negative of negative 3 is just 3, except abstract.

243
00:15:44,940 --> 00:15:47,100
But do you realize what this means?

244
00:15:47,100 --> 00:15:50,380
Have you wondered why the neutral element has to be neutral from both sides, but the

245
00:15:50,380 --> 00:15:53,020
inverse only needs to invert from the right?

246
00:15:53,020 --> 00:15:56,940
It turns out that we don't need to assume left-sided cancellation as an axiom, because

247
00:15:56,940 --> 00:16:00,820
not only can we prove that, but we just did that if you think about it.

248
00:16:00,820 --> 00:16:04,660
The group axioms only allows to cancel inverses from the right.

249
00:16:04,660 --> 00:16:10,500
But a is an inverse, namely the inverse of the inverse, so this is perfectly legal.

250
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:14,860
Now that I say it, maybe I should also justify the name of the inverse.

251
00:16:14,860 --> 00:16:18,500
I talk about the inverse element as if there was a unique one, but could it be that an

252
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:20,540
element has several inverses?

253
00:16:20,540 --> 00:16:22,740
Again, there's not.

254
00:16:22,740 --> 00:16:26,220
Let's assume there were a second inverse and let me operate it from the left to both

255
00:16:26,220 --> 00:16:28,940
sides of the definition of the inverse.

256
00:16:28,940 --> 00:16:32,820
How fortunate that we've just proven that inverses also cancel from the left, so we

257
00:16:32,820 --> 00:16:34,220
can simplify.

258
00:16:34,220 --> 00:16:39,420
Again, by the loss of mathematics, we see that the second inverse is just the original inverse,

259
00:16:39,420 --> 00:16:42,380
so inverses are always unique.

260
00:16:42,380 --> 00:16:46,980
This fact is really convenient, because it allows us to upgrade our notation.

261
00:16:46,980 --> 00:16:48,580
What is this object?

262
00:16:48,580 --> 00:16:52,340
We know that inverses are written with a minus 1 index exponent and squares are written

263
00:16:52,340 --> 00:16:54,100
with a 2 index exponent.

264
00:16:54,100 --> 00:16:55,100
But this?

265
00:16:55,180 --> 00:16:57,660
There are two possibilities that come to mind.

266
00:16:57,660 --> 00:17:02,460
It could be the square of the inverse, or it could be the inverse of the square.

267
00:17:02,460 --> 00:17:06,340
Well, it turns out that those two ideas are actually the same.

268
00:17:06,340 --> 00:17:08,660
Both objects invert a squared.

269
00:17:08,660 --> 00:17:13,100
I mean, per definition, the inverse of a squared inverts a squared.

270
00:17:13,100 --> 00:17:17,860
But watch, so does twice the inverse.

271
00:17:17,860 --> 00:17:21,460
Since we've just shown that there can be only one inverse, there's no difference between

272
00:17:21,460 --> 00:17:25,820
them, and it is customary to write that object as a to the minus 2.

273
00:17:25,820 --> 00:17:29,940
This is just like how there's no difference between 3 plus 3 negated and 3 negated plus

274
00:17:29,940 --> 00:17:33,940
3 negated, both objects are denoted by minus 6.

275
00:17:33,940 --> 00:17:37,620
The same reasoning extends to any negative power, but let's stop here.

276
00:17:37,620 --> 00:17:41,180
I've already proven 5 theorems in such a short time.

277
00:17:41,180 --> 00:17:45,740
Again, the uniqueness of the neutral element, that the inverse of the inverse is the original,

278
00:17:45,740 --> 00:17:50,260
that inverses also cancel from the left, the uniqueness of inverses, and finally, the inverse

279
00:17:50,260 --> 00:17:53,420
of the square is the square of the inverse.

280
00:17:53,420 --> 00:17:57,880
But if you too want to have a try at proving such theorems, I can give you this challenge.

281
00:17:57,880 --> 00:18:01,260
The group axioms I have given you are not the weakest ones.

282
00:18:01,260 --> 00:18:05,860
You can actually remove left-sided neutrality, and yet the definition of groups is unchanged

283
00:18:05,860 --> 00:18:09,660
in the sense that we can prove left-sided neutrality as a theorem.

284
00:18:09,660 --> 00:18:11,940
So go ahead and try to do exactly that.

285
00:18:11,940 --> 00:18:15,380
I didn't want to work with these weaker axioms here, since that would just double the length

286
00:18:15,380 --> 00:18:19,940
of our proofs without gaining that much more insight.

287
00:18:19,940 --> 00:18:23,580
We're at a point where I feel like I need to justify myself.

288
00:18:23,580 --> 00:18:27,300
These theorems are supposed to uncover the hidden structure of mathematics, but when I

289
00:18:27,300 --> 00:18:31,380
talk about how the fact that negating the negation and taking the reciprocal off the

290
00:18:31,380 --> 00:18:35,460
reciprocal both gave me back the original is just an instance of this underlying theorem

291
00:18:35,460 --> 00:18:39,700
on inverses of inverses, it just makes me feel like a nut job rambling about how all

292
00:18:39,700 --> 00:18:43,220
number systems are secretly ruled through group theory.

293
00:18:43,220 --> 00:18:46,780
But what's the point of proving abstract theorems if we never get something concrete

294
00:18:46,780 --> 00:18:47,780
out of it?

295
00:18:47,900 --> 00:18:51,700
It's time we studied big picture in group theory to see where this is all going, and

296
00:18:51,700 --> 00:18:54,540
prove our first big theorem along the way.

297
00:18:54,540 --> 00:18:58,380
And what better way is there to study groups than with more groups?

298
00:19:03,580 --> 00:19:07,620
A subgroup is as part of the group that also happens to be a group itself.

299
00:19:07,620 --> 00:19:11,380
For example the even integers are a subgroup of the integers.

300
00:19:11,380 --> 00:19:16,580
Even though they are just a subset of the integers, they still satisfy all four axioms.

301
00:19:16,580 --> 00:19:18,700
Let's for example check the last one.

302
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:23,780
The inverse axiom is satisfied since every number indeed has an inverse.

303
00:19:23,780 --> 00:19:27,660
On the other hand, the odd integers do not form a group because they don't even satisfy

304
00:19:27,660 --> 00:19:30,740
the very first rule, the closure axiom.

305
00:19:30,740 --> 00:19:35,220
An odd integer added to an odd integer gives an even integer, which is outside the domain

306
00:19:35,220 --> 00:19:39,540
of odd integers, so they do not form a closed system.

307
00:19:39,540 --> 00:19:43,420
As another example, D6 also has subgroups.

308
00:19:43,420 --> 00:19:47,300
For example it's intuitively clear that the rotations do form a closed system, since

309
00:19:47,300 --> 00:19:51,820
a rotation and a rotation gives you another rotation, and proving that they indeed are

310
00:19:51,820 --> 00:19:54,660
a subgroup is just routine.

311
00:19:54,660 --> 00:19:59,180
D3, the symmetries of a triangle, is also a subgroup of D6.

312
00:19:59,180 --> 00:20:02,700
But if you think about it, that makes sense, as any transformation that is valid for the

313
00:20:02,700 --> 00:20:06,940
triangle is also valid for the hexagon.

314
00:20:06,940 --> 00:20:12,140
And as a final example, in Z9 there's a subgroup of 0,3,6.

315
00:20:12,140 --> 00:20:15,660
I again don't want to prove now that this is a subgroup, because I think it's again

316
00:20:15,660 --> 00:20:19,500
intuitively clear that this is at least a closed system.

317
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:23,300
All elements are multiples of 3, and if the only thing you can do is move around with

318
00:20:23,300 --> 00:20:27,180
multiples of 3, you're obviously going to be locked into this system.

319
00:20:27,180 --> 00:20:30,340
There's nothing really much else to say about subgroups.

320
00:20:30,340 --> 00:20:35,140
I could bombard you with 10 more examples of subgroups, but I think they're very intuitive.

321
00:20:35,140 --> 00:20:39,740
So instead I'd rather explore why our intuition works so well, why locking yourself into a

322
00:20:39,740 --> 00:20:42,900
closed system gives you a subgroup.

323
00:20:42,900 --> 00:20:47,140
Just how the subgroup of rotations can be expressed as multiples of the 6th degree rotation,

324
00:20:47,140 --> 00:20:51,860
and the 0,3,6 subgroup can be expressed as multiples of 3, in general for any element

325
00:20:51,860 --> 00:20:56,340
a, the so called subgroup generated by a is defined as the multiples of a, which are

326
00:20:56,340 --> 00:21:00,340
just a, a squared, a cubed, and so on.

327
00:21:00,340 --> 00:21:04,580
This system is obviously closed, since operating a power of a with another power of a gives

328
00:21:04,580 --> 00:21:06,700
you again a power of a.

329
00:21:06,700 --> 00:21:10,740
I claim though that for finite groups this is indeed a subgroup, even though it looks

330
00:21:10,740 --> 00:21:14,020
like the neutral element and inverses are missing.

331
00:21:14,020 --> 00:21:17,500
But let's look at what happens in a finite group when we keep on generating powers of

332
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:21,500
a.

333
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:25,740
At some point we simply run out of elements, and sooner or later we have no choice but

334
00:21:25,740 --> 00:21:29,580
to generate the neutral element as a power of a.

335
00:21:29,580 --> 00:21:33,940
After that this process runs into a cycle, since if a to the a returns to e, then a to

336
00:21:33,940 --> 00:21:36,860
the 9 is just a again, and so on.

337
00:21:36,860 --> 00:21:39,860
And it's not hard to see that we now get inverses for free.

338
00:21:39,860 --> 00:21:44,860
If a to the 8 equals e, the inverse of a is just its own 7th power.

339
00:21:44,860 --> 00:21:48,620
Just one thing that I'd like to clarify is why the cycle has to return to the neutral

340
00:21:48,620 --> 00:21:53,180
element before repeating, because why couldn't a to the 8 go straight to a?

341
00:21:53,180 --> 00:21:57,940
Well if a to the 8 equals a, then cancelling an a from both sides, we see that already

342
00:21:57,940 --> 00:22:00,500
a to the 7 got to the neutral element.

343
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:05,220
So in this sense you cannot avoid the neutral element, so the proof works out.

344
00:22:05,220 --> 00:22:09,460
Remember though that this works only for finite groups, because it can fail horribly for infinite

345
00:22:09,460 --> 00:22:10,460
groups.

346
00:22:10,460 --> 00:22:14,620
Trying to express the subgroup of even integers as a subgroup generated by 2 will generate

347
00:22:14,620 --> 00:22:19,780
only positive multiples of 2, completely missing 0 and the inverses.

348
00:22:19,780 --> 00:22:23,980
In such a case, to make this a subgroup, one makes life easy, and includes the neutral

349
00:22:23,980 --> 00:22:29,860
and the inverse elements in the definition of the subgroup generated by a anyway.

350
00:22:29,860 --> 00:22:31,880
But again, only if needed.

351
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:35,460
So to bring my point across, I have a second challenge for you.

352
00:22:35,460 --> 00:22:39,020
Find an element in an infinite group whose generated subgroup doesn't need the neutral

353
00:22:39,020 --> 00:22:44,300
element or inverses included.

354
00:22:44,300 --> 00:22:48,300
With our fancy new notation for subgroups, we have an opportunity to a deeper understanding

355
00:22:48,300 --> 00:22:49,300
of groups.

356
00:22:49,300 --> 00:22:53,020
It turns out that groups are highly symmetric with respect to their subgroups, and what

357
00:22:53,020 --> 00:22:57,040
I mean by highly symmetric is that shifted copies of the subgroup appear all over their

358
00:22:57,040 --> 00:22:58,980
place inside a group.

359
00:22:58,980 --> 00:23:03,420
In the integers for example, we have the even integers, but also the odd integers, and while

360
00:23:03,420 --> 00:23:07,820
we saw that the odd integers are not the group, they are at least a shifted copy of the even

361
00:23:07,820 --> 00:23:11,820
integers, where every element is shifted by plus 1.

362
00:23:11,820 --> 00:23:16,140
The mathematical term for such a shifted copy of a subgroup is a coset.

363
00:23:16,140 --> 00:23:19,780
Again since it's not a group, we wouldn't call it a co-group or something like that,

364
00:23:19,780 --> 00:23:23,860
but it is more than just any random set of elements, so at least it has a distinguished

365
00:23:23,860 --> 00:23:25,060
name.

366
00:23:25,060 --> 00:23:28,980
The coset is then denoted with that shift in front of the subgroup, so here the odd

367
00:23:28,980 --> 00:23:32,460
integers are 1 plus the even integers.

368
00:23:32,460 --> 00:23:35,900
Note that there is some ambiguity, because we might as well have gotten the odd integers

369
00:23:35,900 --> 00:23:41,420
with a shift of 3, so writing the coset as 3 plus the even integers is just as legal.

370
00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:46,380
Furthermore, since a shift of 2 or even a shift of 0 gives us the even integers themselves,

371
00:23:46,380 --> 00:23:50,220
a group does count as its own coset.

372
00:23:50,220 --> 00:23:53,500
We can also find such symmetries in D6.

373
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:58,340
Here we have the rotations, which are a subgroup, and the flipped rotations, which are the rotations

374
00:23:58,340 --> 00:24:01,740
shifted by a flipped, and are therefore a coset.

375
00:24:01,740 --> 00:24:05,980
You could shift the rotations by a rotation itself, and while that would shuffle the rotations

376
00:24:05,980 --> 00:24:11,500
around, the 0 degree to the 60 degree, the 60 degree to the 120 degree, and so on, the

377
00:24:11,500 --> 00:24:14,180
subgroup itself would be unaffected.

378
00:24:14,180 --> 00:24:19,980
So the dihedral group has this innate symmetry between normal hexagons and the flipped hexagons.

379
00:24:19,980 --> 00:24:22,300
But we can take it even further.

380
00:24:22,300 --> 00:24:25,820
Let's turn the game around, and instead of starting with the rotations and then shifting

381
00:24:25,820 --> 00:24:30,300
with the flip, we start with the flips and shift with the rotations.

382
00:24:30,300 --> 00:24:34,340
The subgroup generated by the flip generates just two elements.

383
00:24:34,340 --> 00:24:38,300
The flip, and flipping again, brings you back to the neutral element.

384
00:24:38,300 --> 00:24:42,900
Shifting that subgroup by 6 degrees gives the 60 degree rotation, and as I've noted

385
00:24:42,900 --> 00:24:46,380
before, a flipped 300 degree rotation.

386
00:24:46,380 --> 00:24:49,980
Shift by 120 degrees and we get another two element coset.

387
00:24:49,980 --> 00:24:51,740
And so on.

388
00:24:51,740 --> 00:24:55,660
By the way, we don't need to shift by flips, since that would just again shuffle the elements

389
00:24:55,660 --> 00:24:59,420
in the coset around, but not affect the coset itself.

390
00:24:59,420 --> 00:25:03,860
In the end, we uncover a new 6-fold symmetry in the dihedral group.

391
00:25:03,860 --> 00:25:07,760
This diagram gives us a complete understanding of this excited symmetry, and the two-sided

392
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:09,840
symmetry is also easy to grasp.

393
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:14,120
But what I think is more important is what you're not seeing in these diagrams.

394
00:25:14,120 --> 00:25:17,500
Why is it that the group can always be organized so neatly?

395
00:25:17,500 --> 00:25:20,820
You know, it could have been that they are the rotations, the flipped rotations, and

396
00:25:20,820 --> 00:25:23,100
another weird third coset.

397
00:25:23,100 --> 00:25:24,460
But there isn't.

398
00:25:24,460 --> 00:25:29,940
Every element appears once and only once in these cosets in a neat and ordered way.

399
00:25:29,940 --> 00:25:32,420
Why is that?

400
00:25:32,420 --> 00:25:36,660
I promised you that groups are highly symmetric with respect to their subgroups, and here

401
00:25:36,660 --> 00:25:38,860
we have a way to quantify that.

402
00:25:38,860 --> 00:25:42,780
Let's say we have a group with a subgroup inside it.

403
00:25:42,780 --> 00:25:47,420
I want to show that the coset of the subgroups neatly partitioned the group into equally

404
00:25:47,420 --> 00:25:49,580
sized fragments.

405
00:25:49,580 --> 00:25:52,100
There are two facts that are easy to grasp.

406
00:25:52,100 --> 00:25:55,660
The first one is that the cosets cover the whole group, because if you want to cover

407
00:25:55,660 --> 00:26:00,180
any specific element, you do what I think is the most obvious idea.

408
00:26:00,180 --> 00:26:03,940
Shift by exactly that element.

409
00:26:03,940 --> 00:26:09,180
Notice how then the neutral element shifted by x gives exactly x, covering it, along with

410
00:26:09,180 --> 00:26:12,980
the other elements in the coset.

411
00:26:12,980 --> 00:26:16,380
The other fact is that all cosets are of equal size.

412
00:26:16,980 --> 00:26:20,860
Obviously, you don't suddenly get more elements by shifting.

413
00:26:20,860 --> 00:26:23,580
But you also don't get less elements.

414
00:26:23,580 --> 00:26:27,460
At first, it doesn't seem impossible that you'd lose elements, so to speak, by having

415
00:26:27,460 --> 00:26:29,940
two shifts converge the same result.

416
00:26:29,940 --> 00:26:34,980
But for any shift, we can also shift back to the origin with the inverse element.

417
00:26:34,980 --> 00:26:38,500
Look, notice how the inverse cancels here from the left.

418
00:26:38,500 --> 00:26:41,860
I told you our proofs would come in handy at some point.

419
00:26:41,860 --> 00:26:46,580
So if you can recover all original elements like this, a coset smaller than the original

420
00:26:46,580 --> 00:26:50,340
subgroup would now make the inverse shift suddenly give you more elements, which is

421
00:26:50,340 --> 00:26:51,980
also nonsense.

422
00:26:51,980 --> 00:26:56,260
No, it only makes sense for all cosets to have the same number of elements as the original

423
00:26:56,260 --> 00:27:00,420
subgroup, since each of the elements are in a one-to-one correspondence, by shift in

424
00:27:00,420 --> 00:27:04,100
one direction and by the inverse shift in the other direction.

425
00:27:04,100 --> 00:27:08,820
The only fact left to discuss that is not at all obvious is that different cosets don't

426
00:27:08,820 --> 00:27:09,940
overlap.

427
00:27:09,940 --> 00:27:11,740
But let's see.

428
00:27:11,740 --> 00:27:15,700
Here you shift by an element that is already in the subgroup.

429
00:27:15,700 --> 00:27:20,060
Since the subgroup is a closed system, the results are all in the subgroup.

430
00:27:20,060 --> 00:27:24,060
Or you shift by an element that is outside the subgroup.

431
00:27:24,060 --> 00:27:28,220
Could it happen that any result is still in the subgroup, for example z times a equals

432
00:27:28,220 --> 00:27:29,780
b?

433
00:27:29,780 --> 00:27:34,540
Canceling a from both sides and solving for z, we get that z equals b times the inverse

434
00:27:34,540 --> 00:27:36,180
of a.

435
00:27:36,180 --> 00:27:40,940
But since a is an element of the subgroup, so is the inverse of a.

436
00:27:40,940 --> 00:27:46,380
And since b is also an element of the subgroup, so is their product, again because of closure,

437
00:27:46,380 --> 00:27:48,820
so z must be 2.

438
00:27:48,820 --> 00:27:53,140
If we specifically assume that z is outside the subgroup, the result could have never

439
00:27:53,140 --> 00:27:56,180
been in the subgroup in the first place.

440
00:27:56,180 --> 00:28:00,620
So we have this dichotomy, where a coset either doesn't overlap with the subgroup at all,

441
00:28:00,620 --> 00:28:03,460
or it is the whole subgroup itself.

442
00:28:03,460 --> 00:28:08,100
And basically the same argument shows that this dichotomy also holds between cosets, but

443
00:28:08,100 --> 00:28:11,100
I won't repeat all the details here.

444
00:28:11,100 --> 00:28:16,060
All in all, this proves that the cosets partitioned the whole group into equally sized parts.

445
00:28:16,060 --> 00:28:19,980
And for finite groups we can summarize this with a really cool and very easy to remember

446
00:28:19,980 --> 00:28:22,980
theorem called Lagrange's theorem.

447
00:28:22,980 --> 00:28:28,380
Lagrange's theorem states that for a group g and a subgroup h, the order of h divides

448
00:28:28,380 --> 00:28:30,220
the order of g.

449
00:28:30,220 --> 00:28:32,140
And we've seen this, right?

450
00:28:32,140 --> 00:28:36,780
d6 has 12 elements and the subgroup of rotations has 6.

451
00:28:36,780 --> 00:28:42,580
Because we have now rigorously proven that the rotations partition d6, 6 has to divide

452
00:28:42,580 --> 00:28:44,180
12.

453
00:28:44,180 --> 00:28:50,860
Or if we take a look at the cyclic group with 6 elements, it has subgroups of order 3, 2,

454
00:28:50,860 --> 00:28:51,860
and 1.

455
00:28:51,860 --> 00:28:56,300
And there cannot be subgroups of order 5 or 4.

456
00:28:56,300 --> 00:29:02,340
Fun fact about Lagrange's theorem, Lagrange died before group theory was even invented,

457
00:29:02,340 --> 00:29:05,740
makes you wonder how he got his name attached to group theory theorem.

458
00:29:05,740 --> 00:29:08,220
Eh, it's complicated.

459
00:29:08,220 --> 00:29:11,500
And it's not like abstract algebra is known for good naming.

460
00:29:11,500 --> 00:29:15,180
Anyway, so what is this theorem useful for?

461
00:29:15,180 --> 00:29:21,140
Can you imagine the consequences this theorem has for a group with prime order p?

462
00:29:21,140 --> 00:29:28,180
Since primes can only be divided by 1 and p, a subgroup can only have 1 or p elements.

463
00:29:28,180 --> 00:29:34,300
Now, take any element that is not the neutral element, let's call it a, and start generating

464
00:29:34,300 --> 00:29:35,980
its subgroup.

465
00:29:35,980 --> 00:29:40,740
That subgroup contains more than one element, and therefore has to contain all p elements.

466
00:29:40,740 --> 00:29:45,980
So after we eventually reach the neutral element, we will have filled the whole group.

467
00:29:45,980 --> 00:29:50,900
This makes it eerily similar to the cyclic group, so here's a trick.

468
00:29:50,900 --> 00:29:54,540
Instead of the letter a, what if I use this symbol?

469
00:29:54,540 --> 00:29:59,380
And instead of this weird circle operation, what if I write plus?

470
00:29:59,380 --> 00:30:04,860
Then a squared becomes 1 plus 1, which we humans write as 2.

471
00:30:04,860 --> 00:30:09,540
And a cube becomes 1 plus 1 plus 1, which we encode with this symbol.

472
00:30:09,540 --> 00:30:12,740
A to the 4 becomes 4 and so on.

473
00:30:12,740 --> 00:30:16,060
And for e, let me use the digit 0.

474
00:30:16,060 --> 00:30:19,700
So only through relabeling, we got the cyclic group.

475
00:30:19,700 --> 00:30:24,220
But how I write down my group doesn't change anything about the group itself, right?

476
00:30:24,220 --> 00:30:29,580
Which means that any group of prime order, no matter how abstract, has to be the cyclic

477
00:30:29,580 --> 00:30:30,580
group.

478
00:30:30,580 --> 00:30:33,860
When I saw this, I felt like I understood group theory.

479
00:30:33,860 --> 00:30:38,420
Yeah, we could spend all of our time with abstract groups, but it is also possible with

480
00:30:38,420 --> 00:30:43,060
the sheer structural loan we get from the four axioms and the small size requirement

481
00:30:43,060 --> 00:30:46,060
to create very concrete examples.

482

It made me want to go on a quest to uncover the hidden structure of groups of any order.

00:30:51,060 --> 00:30:56,220
I claim that, with what you've learned in this video, you can guess, maybe even prove,

484
00:30:56,220 --> 00:31:00,500
what all the groups of order 6 are, and with the upcoming videos, we'll tackle the problem

485
00:31:00,500 --> 00:31:03,140
of uncovering all the groups.

486
00:31:03,140 --> 00:31:07,140
Wait a minute, weren't we originally trying to solve the graph isomorphism problem?
