00:00.000 --> 00:04.480
Let me begin my introduction to group theory by telling you about my first encounter with

00:04.480 --> 00:05.880
group theory.

00:05.880 --> 00:10.480
There is a famous problem in computer science called the graph isomorphism problem.

00:10.480 --> 00:14.200
Given two graphs, decide whether one can be transformed into the other.

00:14.200 --> 00:17.520
For example, these two here might look different on first glance, but watch how they are just

00:17.520 --> 00:20.060
reshaped versions of one another.

00:20.060 --> 00:22.100
How about these two?

00:22.100 --> 00:25.520
Probably not the same, since one has a crossing while the other one doesn't.

00:25.520 --> 00:29.240
Well, turns out they are the same, despite the crossing.

00:29.240 --> 00:32.720
So here's an example where they have to be different, simply because one has five nodes

00:32.720 --> 00:35.040
while the other one has only two.

00:35.040 --> 00:37.640
But most problem settings are not that easy.

00:37.640 --> 00:40.160
Try to see if you can solve this one.

00:40.160 --> 00:44.240
There is a straightforward algorithm to decide whether two graphs are the same.

00:44.240 --> 00:47.080
Just brute force all possible node positions.

00:47.080 --> 00:52.120
If one possibility works, good, but if none of them work, they truly have to be different.

00:52.120 --> 00:55.720
But there are exponentially many possibilities, so this takes a lot of time.

00:55.720 --> 01:00.280
We would prefer a faster and cleverer algorithm, preferably one that has a sub-exponential

01:00.280 --> 01:01.880
runtime.

01:01.880 --> 01:05.600
Research into this problem took off in the 80s, but it took roughly four decades until

01:05.600 --> 01:10.440
Professor Laszlo Babaay found the first such algorithm in 2015.

01:10.440 --> 01:15.000
His result was a massive achievement, so when I saw that Babaay gave a talk explaining his

01:15.000 --> 01:17.400
algorithm, naturally I wanted to check it out.

01:17.400 --> 01:21.880
But before he even started with this explanation, already in the introduction, he came with

01:21.880 --> 01:26.760
a group theory introduced into the subject.

01:26.760 --> 01:27.760
Group theory?

01:27.760 --> 01:28.760
Really?

01:28.760 --> 01:32.960
I didn't know any group theory, I'm a computer scientist, not a mathematician.

01:32.960 --> 01:36.960
But even though I only uploaded three videos so far, you guys already know that I would

01:36.960 --> 01:41.700
do anything for a nice algorithm, even if this means that I'd have to learn group theory.

01:41.700 --> 01:43.720
So that's what I did.

01:43.720 --> 01:48.080
And my god, you cannot imagine what techniques the mathematicians have kept secrets from us

01:48.080 --> 01:49.680
all this time.

01:49.680 --> 01:53.840
There is this whole field called abstract algebra that basically no one has ever heard

01:53.840 --> 01:57.280
of but is absolutely essential in higher math.

01:57.280 --> 02:02.520
You have to understand, we all start at school learning to count using the natural numbers.

02:02.520 --> 02:07.240
Later we learn that there are also negative numbers, so we get introduced to the integers.

02:07.240 --> 02:12.640
Then we run into the problem that we can't exactly divide 3 by 2, so we encounter fractions.

02:12.640 --> 02:17.320
And finally we learn that there exist irrational numbers like the square root of 2, which cannot

02:17.320 --> 02:19.160
be described as a fraction.

02:19.160 --> 02:23.320
So in the end, they tell you that the so-called real numbers are the ultimate number system

02:23.320 --> 02:26.960
and that you can find every number you'll ever need in your life somewhere on the real

02:26.960 --> 02:28.560
number line.

02:28.560 --> 02:31.280
And that's where the school curriculum ends for most of us.

02:31.280 --> 02:35.440
But you might have heard that in the 16th century, some Italians started to use the

02:35.440 --> 02:39.560
square root of minus 1, something that cannot be found on the number line, but that lives

02:39.560 --> 02:41.320
somewhere outside it.

02:41.320 --> 02:44.280
They had their reasons for doing so, which we're not going into.

02:44.280 --> 02:47.720
But the point is that they slowly realized that with this, they invented a new number

02:47.720 --> 02:51.680
system that they thought was useless in real life, and yet works better than anything that

02:51.680 --> 02:53.720
ever seemed before.

02:53.720 --> 02:57.360
With time, mathematicians tore down more and more of the tradition that the real numbers

02:57.360 --> 03:01.840
are the ultimate system, and they started inventing new number systems left and right.

03:01.840 --> 03:06.800
Some number systems you probably never even knew existed, like the Hamiltonians, finite

03:06.800 --> 03:09.160
fields, and the pediatrics.

03:09.160 --> 03:14.560
The mathematical landscape exploded in variety, and with so many number systems out there,

03:14.560 --> 03:18.800
mathematicians searched for an abstract, unifying theory, a set of rules that governs all these

03:18.800 --> 03:21.560
systems and that captures their behavior.

03:21.560 --> 03:23.760
But what kind of rules would make sense?

03:23.760 --> 03:28.360
How do we know that our theory accurately describes all these number systems?

03:28.360 --> 03:31.840
This is a very tough question to answer.

03:31.840 --> 03:36.400
Mathematicians tried several different sets of rules, always retrying and refining.

03:36.400 --> 03:40.520
And while the names for these abstractions certainly could have needed some improvements,

03:40.520 --> 03:44.920
over the decades of work, certain rules started to crystallize, certain rules that they could

03:44.920 --> 03:47.200
agree simply make the most sense.

03:47.200 --> 03:51.760
One particularly simple but nonetheless powerful theory that started to manifest is the theory

03:51.760 --> 03:53.720
of groups.

03:53.720 --> 03:57.240
Groups are powerful enough to describe the most various things.

03:57.240 --> 04:01.760
They were originally invented for the very specific purpose of analyzing permutations

04:01.760 --> 04:06.960
of roots of a polynomial, but were later used from a common problem such as number theory,

04:06.960 --> 04:11.040
geometry, physics, and making young men go nuts.

04:11.040 --> 04:15.520
In fact, four out of the seven millennium price problems, you know, those problems where

04:15.520 --> 04:20.400
you win a million dollars for solving any of them, use groups in their definition.

04:20.400 --> 04:24.880
But despite their sheer power, groups are so easy to get into that I decided to make

04:24.880 --> 04:35.040
a series on them, starting with this video.

04:35.040 --> 04:36.960
So what is a group?

04:36.960 --> 04:41.320
A group is a collection of elements, can be whatever, numbers, or any other mathematical

04:41.320 --> 04:44.200
objects you desire to get with one operation.

04:44.200 --> 04:49.040
Again, can be whatever, addition, multiplication, or something completely different.

04:49.040 --> 04:52.520
They just have to satisfy these four axioms.

04:52.520 --> 04:54.680
Let's go through them.

04:54.680 --> 04:56.640
The first one is called closure.

04:56.640 --> 05:00.800
It says that the operation takes any two group elements and gives you another element of

05:00.800 --> 05:01.800
the group.

05:02.160 --> 05:03.160
That's it.

05:03.160 --> 05:06.920
Seems pretty anticlimactic, but I mean calculating two things together is something we do all

05:06.920 --> 05:11.440
the time, so at least this shows how groups are supposed to be an abstract generalization

05:11.440 --> 05:15.000
of, you know, most math things.

05:15.000 --> 05:19.400
But the important part is that the math thing the group describes is a closed system, hence

05:19.400 --> 05:23.160
the name closure, in the sense that since the result is again part of the group, you

05:23.160 --> 05:27.840
can continue to operate group elements onto it, which brings me to the next axiom.

05:27.840 --> 05:31.360
The associativity we all know from addition and multiplication.

05:31.360 --> 05:35.440
Formally, it says that when operating three elements together, whether you first operate

05:35.440 --> 05:40.880
A and B, or first operate B and C, the result in the end is the same.

05:40.880 --> 05:44.680
In practice, this means that we can just write everything without parentheses, because there's

05:44.680 --> 05:48.000
no ambiguity about the order in which you calculate.

05:48.000 --> 05:50.760
The next two rules are a bit more interesting, though.

05:50.760 --> 05:55.080
The third rule says that every group contains a so-called neutral element, an element commonly

05:55.080 --> 06:00.200
denoted by E, that when operated with any other element, leaves it B, no matter from

06:00.200 --> 06:03.080
which side this happens.

06:03.080 --> 06:07.120
So it's like an abstract generalization of adding a zero.

06:07.120 --> 06:09.360
Just a remark for the English-speaking people?

06:09.360 --> 06:13.800
For you it's more common to call it the identity element, and it's the French, the Germans,

06:13.800 --> 06:17.960
the Italians, and pretty much anyone else that calls it the neutral element.

06:17.960 --> 06:22.380
In my humble opinion, neutral makes more sense, especially if you're new to group theory,

06:22.380 --> 06:25.400
so that's what we're going to roll with from now on.

06:25.400 --> 06:30.060
And the final rule says that every element has a corresponding so-called inverse element,

06:30.060 --> 06:33.100
always denoted with a minus one index exponent.

06:33.100 --> 06:37.600
The inverse element, when operated on the original, annihilates both elements and returns

06:37.600 --> 06:39.860
the neutral element.

06:39.860 --> 06:41.740
Let me justify the name inverse.

06:41.740 --> 06:47.340
Let's say we start with A and operate B and C and D onto it.

06:47.340 --> 06:52.740
If you now want to revert all those operations, you just apply the respective inverses.

06:52.740 --> 06:57.300
First the inverse of D gives with D itself the neutral element, and the neutral element

06:57.300 --> 06:59.220
vanishes anyway.

06:59.220 --> 07:03.920
Likewise we can apply the inverse of C, which with C gives again the neutral element, which

07:03.920 --> 07:06.020
vanishes too.

07:06.020 --> 07:10.500
And now the inverse of B, you already know that they cancel, I'm not even gonna bother

07:10.500 --> 07:12.660
to animate the whole ordeal.

07:12.660 --> 07:14.500
But look, we're back at A.

07:14.500 --> 07:20.140
So the inverses, as their name suggests, reverted all previous operations.

07:20.140 --> 07:23.580
Also the notation for the inverse has a sensible purpose.

07:23.580 --> 07:28.580
In group theory it is legal and even very common to abbreviate A operated on A operated

07:28.580 --> 07:33.640
on A operated on A, simply as A to the 4, as you know it from multiplication.

07:33.640 --> 07:37.900
When you now operate the inverse of A to A to the 4, think about what happens behind

07:37.900 --> 07:39.840
the scenes.

07:39.840 --> 07:43.980
The inverse cancels one of the A's and we're left with three A's.

07:43.980 --> 07:48.500
So essentially A to the minus one subtracted one from the exponent, which is pretty much

07:48.500 --> 07:51.380
what the notation indicates it would do.

07:51.380 --> 07:55.420
But yeah, any mathematical structure that satisfies these four axioms gets the privilege

07:55.420 --> 07:56.940
of being a group.

07:56.940 --> 07:59.980
You're probably curious by now what such a group could look like, so it's time for

07:59.980 --> 08:06.220
some examples.

08:06.220 --> 08:11.860
The integers, denoted with a Z, with addition as the operation form a group.

08:12.180 --> 08:18.120
Indeed closure is satisfied as you can always add any two integers and get another integer.

08:18.120 --> 08:22.660
And we all know that addition is associative, which again means that order doesn't matter

08:22.660 --> 08:27.820
and that is reflected in the fact that we usually don't write down parentheses.

08:27.820 --> 08:31.400
Already in the definition of groups, I've hinted that zero is the neutral element, as

08:31.400 --> 08:35.740
indeed zero added to the any number is that same number, no matter if it's added from

08:35.740 --> 08:38.420
the right or the left.

08:38.420 --> 08:42.340
And for the last rule to hold, we just need to show that every integer has an inverse,

08:42.340 --> 08:45.700
which added together returns the neutral element.

08:45.700 --> 08:48.860
That would be its negative, so all conditions are met.

08:48.860 --> 08:49.860
Very well.

08:49.860 --> 08:55.020
On the other hand, the integers with multiplication as the operation do not form a group.

08:55.020 --> 08:57.540
I mean let's check the axioms.

08:57.540 --> 09:03.860
Closure is satisfied because multiplying two integers gives another integer.

09:03.860 --> 09:06.260
Associativity is also satisfied.

09:06.260 --> 09:12.500
The neutral element is now one, as multiplying by one leaves any element be.

09:12.500 --> 09:15.540
But it's the last rule that is not satisfied.

09:15.540 --> 09:20.540
For it to be satisfied, we would need to be able to get from any element back to one.

09:20.540 --> 09:24.780
But to get, let's say, from four to one, we would need to multiply by a quarter, which

09:24.780 --> 09:28.100
is not an integer and doesn't exist in this domain.

09:28.100 --> 09:33.660
So not all rules are satisfied and this system does not get the privilege of being a group.

09:33.660 --> 09:41.340
But this hints that the rationals on their multiplication do form a group.

09:41.340 --> 09:46.220
If we allow not only whole numbers, but also rational numbers, which are denoted by a queue,

09:46.220 --> 09:50.220
then the first three rules hold as discussed, but now for any number, the inverse is its

09:50.220 --> 09:51.220
reciprocal.

09:51.220 --> 09:55.060
Except, there's one hipster that has no reciprocal.

09:55.060 --> 09:59.860
So it is customary to exclude zero, which makes it so that all axioms are indeed satisfied

09:59.860 --> 10:03.060
and we therefore have another example for a group.

10:03.060 --> 10:06.500
We have a problem though, because if you check the four axioms, you'll realize that

10:06.500 --> 10:09.860
the rationals also form a group under addition.

10:09.860 --> 10:13.700
To differentiate between these two groups, one adds a respective operation symbol to

10:13.700 --> 10:17.900
each group and it's expected from good group theories to know that the group where we multiply

10:17.900 --> 10:21.420
is all the rationals except zero.

10:21.420 --> 10:25.140
All three groups we've looked at so far have infinitely many elements.

10:25.140 --> 10:28.940
How many elements a group has is called the order of the group and is written with these

10:28.940 --> 10:30.540
two bars.

10:30.540 --> 10:35.580
And in the early days of group theory, groups commonly only had finitely many elements.

10:35.580 --> 10:42.580
So let's look at some finite examples.

10:42.580 --> 10:47.460
The cyclic group, denoted by the n, is actually a whole family of groups, because the n denotes

10:47.460 --> 10:51.260
just a placeholder for any positive integer of your choice.

10:51.260 --> 10:53.260
Here I'll choose six.

10:53.260 --> 10:57.260
Then C6 behaves pretty much as the ordinary integers would do, in a sense that we start

10:57.260 --> 11:04.100
at zero and repeatedly adding one gives one, two, three, four, five, but when we get to

11:04.100 --> 11:07.380
six, we wrap around and start again at zero.

11:07.380 --> 11:10.740
This cycling back around is where the name cyclic comes from.

11:10.740 --> 11:15.260
So in this group, three plus three does not equal six, but it cycles back to zero.

11:15.260 --> 11:20.180
Similarly, four plus five would usually give nine, but since we cycle back at six, seven

11:20.180 --> 11:25.980
equals one, eight equals two, and finally nine actually equals three.

11:26.220 --> 11:30.340
Apart from the fact that the cyclic group has finite order, C6 has six elements, and

11:30.340 --> 11:34.580
Cn has n elements, not much has changed compared to the integers.

11:34.580 --> 11:39.980
The system is still closed, addition is associative, and adding zero doesn't affect the result.

11:39.980 --> 11:44.100
It's just that now the inverse of, let's say, one is not minus one, since that doesn't

11:44.100 --> 11:46.220
exist, but five.

11:46.220 --> 11:48.260
And the inverse of two is four.

11:48.260 --> 11:54.700
For three it's three, for four it's two, for five it's one, and for zero it's zero itself.

11:54.700 --> 12:01.820
And from zero, in general in Cn, the inverse of a number a is n minus a.

12:01.820 --> 12:05.660
In all four groups, we've looked at so far the elements commute, meaning that a operated

12:05.660 --> 12:08.820
on b is the same as b operated on a.

12:08.820 --> 12:13.300
But be careful, even though the circle looks and feels like a multiplication symbol, it

12:13.300 --> 12:14.460
is not.

12:14.460 --> 12:17.060
There is no rule that says that they should commute.

12:17.060 --> 12:21.180
So I want to introduce one final example, in which the elements do not commute.

12:25.540 --> 12:29.580
The dihedral group, or short the n, works as follows.

12:29.580 --> 12:31.740
Choose any regular polygon.

12:31.740 --> 12:34.060
Here I'm going to choose the hexagon.

12:34.060 --> 12:38.740
The dihedral group, since I've chosen a six-sided polygon written here as d6, is the different

12:38.740 --> 12:42.820
ways to transform space such that the hexagon stays in place.

12:42.820 --> 12:46.020
There are six rotations that do exactly that.

12:46.020 --> 13:00.900
A full 360 rotation transforms space in the same way that a zero-degree rotation would,

13:00.900 --> 13:03.220
so it's not counted as a new element.

13:03.220 --> 13:06.420
But we can also flip the hexagon.

13:06.420 --> 13:11.900
And combining the flip with the rotations gives us six more elements.

13:11.900 --> 13:16.260
And if you think about it, the hexagon only has 12 possible configurations it can be in,

13:16.260 --> 13:20.020
so these 12 elements are already all the transformations.

13:20.020 --> 13:24.060
By the same reasoning, we see that the order of dn, the group of transformations for an

13:24.060 --> 13:29.980
n-sided polygon, is 2 times n, again n rotations and n flipped rotations.

13:29.980 --> 13:33.060
The operation of this group is the chaining of these transformations.

13:33.060 --> 13:38.660
For example, chaining a 60-degree with a 240-degree rotation gives you a 300-degree rotation.

13:38.660 --> 13:42.220
And you know, we could verify that this makes a group.

13:42.220 --> 13:47.580
Anyway, what I'm going to demonstrate here is that the order of elements does matter.

13:47.580 --> 13:53.420
For a given hexagon, if we flip it and then rotate it by 60 degrees, we get this transformation.

13:53.420 --> 13:58.260
But if we rotate it first and then flip it, then we get a different transformation.

13:58.260 --> 14:02.860
In general, a flip in a rotation is not the same as a rotation on the flip.

14:02.860 --> 14:07.260
The former obviously gives a flipped rotation, and the latter turns out here equals a flipped

14:07.260 --> 14:11.820
300-degree rotation.

14:11.820 --> 14:15.820
So now we've seen five examples of groups, but the power of group theory does not come

14:15.820 --> 14:19.180
to fruition by looking at groups one by one individually.

14:19.180 --> 14:22.660
The whole point is that when you prove theorems for the abstract concept of a group, they

14:22.660 --> 14:25.700
automatically hold for all instances of groups.

14:25.700 --> 14:31.100
So it's time we prove theorems the way it's done in group theory.

14:31.100 --> 14:34.740
First of all, I would like to justify the name of the neutral element.

14:34.740 --> 14:38.100
I talk about the neutral element as if there was a unique one, but couldn't it be that

14:38.100 --> 14:40.660
a group contains several neutral elements?

14:40.660 --> 14:42.620
It turns out that this is not so.

14:42.620 --> 14:46.500
Suppose that there were the neutral elements e1 and e2.

14:46.500 --> 14:49.380
What would happen if we operated them together?

14:49.380 --> 14:53.940
On one hand, since e2 is a neutral element, this equals e1.

14:53.940 --> 15:00.020
On the other hand, since e1 is a neutral element, this also equals e2 at the same time.

15:00.020 --> 15:03.300
This is only possible if e1 equals e2.

15:03.300 --> 15:07.580
By the laws of mathematics, if two things equal each other, they are the same thing,

15:07.580 --> 15:12.340
so instead of two separate neutral elements, a group always has only one.

15:12.340 --> 15:14.540
Let's prove another theorem similarly.

15:14.540 --> 15:19.780
By definition, every element has an inverse, but that means that also the inverse has an

15:19.780 --> 15:20.780
inverse.

15:20.780 --> 15:24.620
Let's again just operate all these elements together and see what happens.

15:24.620 --> 15:30.100
On one hand, a and the inverse of a cancel, so this equals the inverse of the inverse.

15:30.100 --> 15:35.100
On the other hand, the inverse and its inverse cancel, leaving a.

15:35.100 --> 15:38.820
So this means that the inverse of the inverse is just the original.

15:38.820 --> 15:44.940
This is just like how the negative of negative 3 is just 3, except abstract.

15:44.940 --> 15:47.100
But do you realize what this means?

15:47.100 --> 15:50.380
Have you wondered why the neutral element has to be neutral from both sides, but the

15:50.380 --> 15:53.020
inverse only needs to invert from the right?

15:53.020 --> 15:56.940
It turns out that we don't need to assume left-sided cancellation as an axiom, because

15:56.940 --> 16:00.820
not only can we prove that, but we just did that if you think about it.

16:00.820 --> 16:04.660
The group axioms only allows to cancel inverses from the right.

16:04.660 --> 16:10.500
But a is an inverse, namely the inverse of the inverse, so this is perfectly legal.

16:10.500 --> 16:14.860
Now that I say it, maybe I should also justify the name of the inverse.

16:14.860 --> 16:18.500
I talk about the inverse element as if there was a unique one, but could it be that an

16:18.500 --> 16:20.540
element has several inverses?

16:20.540 --> 16:22.740
Again, there's not.

16:22.740 --> 16:26.220
Let's assume there were a second inverse and let me operate it from the left to both

16:26.220 --> 16:28.940
sides of the definition of the inverse.

16:28.940 --> 16:32.820
How fortunate that we've just proven that inverses also cancel from the left, so we

16:32.820 --> 16:34.220
can simplify.

16:34.220 --> 16:39.420
Again, by the loss of mathematics, we see that the second inverse is just the original inverse,

16:39.420 --> 16:42.380
so inverses are always unique.

16:42.380 --> 16:46.980
This fact is really convenient, because it allows us to upgrade our notation.

16:46.980 --> 16:48.580
What is this object?

16:48.580 --> 16:52.340
We know that inverses are written with a minus 1 index exponent and squares are written

16:52.340 --> 16:54.100
with a 2 index exponent.

16:54.100 --> 16:55.100
But this?

16:55.180 --> 16:57.660
There are two possibilities that come to mind.

16:57.660 --> 17:02.460
It could be the square of the inverse, or it could be the inverse of the square.

17:02.460 --> 17:06.340
Well, it turns out that those two ideas are actually the same.

17:06.340 --> 17:08.660
Both objects invert a squared.

17:08.660 --> 17:13.100
I mean, per definition, the inverse of a squared inverts a squared.

17:13.100 --> 17:17.860
But watch, so does twice the inverse.

17:17.860 --> 17:21.460
Since we've just shown that there can be only one inverse, there's no difference between

17:21.460 --> 17:25.820
them, and it is customary to write that object as a to the minus 2.

17:25.820 --> 17:29.940
This is just like how there's no difference between 3 plus 3 negated and 3 negated plus

17:29.940 --> 17:33.940
3 negated, both objects are denoted by minus 6.

17:33.940 --> 17:37.620
The same reasoning extends to any negative power, but let's stop here.

17:37.620 --> 17:41.180
I've already proven 5 theorems in such a short time.

17:41.180 --> 17:45.740
Again, the uniqueness of the neutral element, that the inverse of the inverse is the original,

17:45.740 --> 17:50.260
that inverses also cancel from the left, the uniqueness of inverses, and finally, the inverse

17:50.260 --> 17:53.420
of the square is the square of the inverse.

17:53.420 --> 17:57.880
But if you too want to have a try at proving such theorems, I can give you this challenge.

17:57.880 --> 18:01.260
The group axioms I have given you are not the weakest ones.

18:01.260 --> 18:05.860
You can actually remove left-sided neutrality, and yet the definition of groups is unchanged

18:05.860 --> 18:09.660
in the sense that we can prove left-sided neutrality as a theorem.

18:09.660 --> 18:11.940
So go ahead and try to do exactly that.

18:11.940 --> 18:15.380
I didn't want to work with these weaker axioms here, since that would just double the length

18:15.380 --> 18:19.940
of our proofs without gaining that much more insight.

18:19.940 --> 18:23.580
We're at a point where I feel like I need to justify myself.

18:23.580 --> 18:27.300
These theorems are supposed to uncover the hidden structure of mathematics, but when I

18:27.300 --> 18:31.380
talk about how the fact that negating the negation and taking the reciprocal off the

18:31.380 --> 18:35.460
reciprocal both gave me back the original is just an instance of this underlying theorem

18:35.460 --> 18:39.700
on inverses of inverses, it just makes me feel like a nut job rambling about how all

18:39.700 --> 18:43.220
number systems are secretly ruled through group theory.

18:43.220 --> 18:46.780
But what's the point of proving abstract theorems if we never get something concrete

18:46.780 --> 18:47.780
out of it?

18:47.900 --> 18:51.700
It's time we studied big picture in group theory to see where this is all going, and

18:51.700 --> 18:54.540
prove our first big theorem along the way.

18:54.540 --> 18:58.380
And what better way is there to study groups than with more groups?

19:03.580 --> 19:07.620
A subgroup is as part of the group that also happens to be a group itself.

19:07.620 --> 19:11.380
For example the even integers are a subgroup of the integers.

19:11.380 --> 19:16.580
Even though they are just a subset of the integers, they still satisfy all four axioms.

19:16.580 --> 19:18.700
Let's for example check the last one.

19:18.700 --> 19:23.780
The inverse axiom is satisfied since every number indeed has an inverse.

19:23.780 --> 19:27.660
On the other hand, the odd integers do not form a group because they don't even satisfy

19:27.660 --> 19:30.740
the very first rule, the closure axiom.

19:30.740 --> 19:35.220
An odd integer added to an odd integer gives an even integer, which is outside the domain

19:35.220 --> 19:39.540
of odd integers, so they do not form a closed system.

19:39.540 --> 19:43.420
As another example, D6 also has subgroups.

19:43.420 --> 19:47.300
For example it's intuitively clear that the rotations do form a closed system, since

19:47.300 --> 19:51.820
a rotation and a rotation gives you another rotation, and proving that they indeed are

19:51.820 --> 19:54.660
a subgroup is just routine.

19:54.660 --> 19:59.180
D3, the symmetries of a triangle, is also a subgroup of D6.

19:59.180 --> 20:02.700
But if you think about it, that makes sense, as any transformation that is valid for the

20:02.700 --> 20:06.940
triangle is also valid for the hexagon.

20:06.940 --> 20:12.140
And as a final example, in Z9 there's a subgroup of 0,3,6.

20:12.140 --> 20:15.660
I again don't want to prove now that this is a subgroup, because I think it's again

20:15.660 --> 20:19.500
intuitively clear that this is at least a closed system.

20:19.500 --> 20:23.300
All elements are multiples of 3, and if the only thing you can do is move around with

20:23.300 --> 20:27.180
multiples of 3, you're obviously going to be locked into this system.

20:27.180 --> 20:30.340
There's nothing really much else to say about subgroups.

20:30.340 --> 20:35.140
I could bombard you with 10 more examples of subgroups, but I think they're very intuitive.

20:35.140 --> 20:39.740
So instead I'd rather explore why our intuition works so well, why locking yourself into a

20:39.740 --> 20:42.900
closed system gives you a subgroup.

20:42.900 --> 20:47.140
Just how the subgroup of rotations can be expressed as multiples of the 6th degree rotation,

20:47.140 --> 20:51.860
and the 0,3,6 subgroup can be expressed as multiples of 3, in general for any element

20:51.860 --> 20:56.340
a, the so called subgroup generated by a is defined as the multiples of a, which are

20:56.340 --> 21:00.340
just a, a squared, a cubed, and so on.

21:00.340 --> 21:04.580
This system is obviously closed, since operating a power of a with another power of a gives

21:04.580 --> 21:06.700
you again a power of a.

21:06.700 --> 21:10.740
I claim though that for finite groups this is indeed a subgroup, even though it looks

21:10.740 --> 21:14.020
like the neutral element and inverses are missing.

21:14.020 --> 21:17.500
But let's look at what happens in a finite group when we keep on generating powers of

21:17.500 --> 21:21.500
a.

21:21.500 --> 21:25.740
At some point we simply run out of elements, and sooner or later we have no choice but

21:25.740 --> 21:29.580
to generate the neutral element as a power of a.

21:29.580 --> 21:33.940
After that this process runs into a cycle, since if a to the a returns to e, then a to

21:33.940 --> 21:36.860
the 9 is just a again, and so on.

21:36.860 --> 21:39.860
And it's not hard to see that we now get inverses for free.

21:39.860 --> 21:44.860
If a to the 8 equals e, the inverse of a is just its own 7th power.

21:44.860 --> 21:48.620
Just one thing that I'd like to clarify is why the cycle has to return to the neutral

21:48.620 --> 21:53.180
element before repeating, because why couldn't a to the 8 go straight to a?

21:53.180 --> 21:57.940
Well if a to the 8 equals a, then cancelling an a from both sides, we see that already

21:57.940 --> 22:00.500
a to the 7 got to the neutral element.

22:00.500 --> 22:05.220
So in this sense you cannot avoid the neutral element, so the proof works out.

22:05.220 --> 22:09.460
Remember though that this works only for finite groups, because it can fail horribly for infinite

22:09.460 --> 22:10.460
groups.

22:10.460 --> 22:14.620
Trying to express the subgroup of even integers as a subgroup generated by 2 will generate

22:14.620 --> 22:19.780
only positive multiples of 2, completely missing 0 and the inverses.

22:19.780 --> 22:23.980
In such a case, to make this a subgroup, one makes life easy, and includes the neutral

22:23.980 --> 22:29.860
and the inverse elements in the definition of the subgroup generated by a anyway.

22:29.860 --> 22:31.880
But again, only if needed.

22:31.880 --> 22:35.460
So to bring my point across, I have a second challenge for you.

22:35.460 --> 22:39.020
Find an element in an infinite group whose generated subgroup doesn't need the neutral

22:39.020 --> 22:44.300
element or inverses included.

22:44.300 --> 22:48.300
With our fancy new notation for subgroups, we have an opportunity to a deeper understanding

22:48.300 --> 22:49.300
of groups.

22:49.300 --> 22:53.020
It turns out that groups are highly symmetric with respect to their subgroups, and what

22:53.020 --> 22:57.040
I mean by highly symmetric is that shifted copies of the subgroup appear all over their

22:57.040 --> 22:58.980
place inside a group.

22:58.980 --> 23:03.420
In the integers for example, we have the even integers, but also the odd integers, and while

23:03.420 --> 23:07.820
we saw that the odd integers are not the group, they are at least a shifted copy of the even

23:07.820 --> 23:11.820
integers, where every element is shifted by plus 1.

23:11.820 --> 23:16.140
The mathematical term for such a shifted copy of a subgroup is a coset.

23:16.140 --> 23:19.780
Again since it's not a group, we wouldn't call it a co-group or something like that,

23:19.780 --> 23:23.860
but it is more than just any random set of elements, so at least it has a distinguished

23:23.860 --> 23:25.060
name.

23:25.060 --> 23:28.980
The coset is then denoted with that shift in front of the subgroup, so here the odd

23:28.980 --> 23:32.460
integers are 1 plus the even integers.

23:32.460 --> 23:35.900
Note that there is some ambiguity, because we might as well have gotten the odd integers

23:35.900 --> 23:41.420
with a shift of 3, so writing the coset as 3 plus the even integers is just as legal.

23:41.420 --> 23:46.380
Furthermore, since a shift of 2 or even a shift of 0 gives us the even integers themselves,

23:46.380 --> 23:50.220
a group does count as its own coset.

23:50.220 --> 23:53.500
We can also find such symmetries in D6.

23:53.500 --> 23:58.340
Here we have the rotations, which are a subgroup, and the flipped rotations, which are the rotations

23:58.340 --> 24:01.740
shifted by a flipped, and are therefore a coset.

24:01.740 --> 24:05.980
You could shift the rotations by a rotation itself, and while that would shuffle the rotations

24:05.980 --> 24:11.500
around, the 0 degree to the 60 degree, the 60 degree to the 120 degree, and so on, the

24:11.500 --> 24:14.180
subgroup itself would be unaffected.

24:14.180 --> 24:19.980
So the dihedral group has this innate symmetry between normal hexagons and the flipped hexagons.

24:19.980 --> 24:22.300
But we can take it even further.

24:22.300 --> 24:25.820
Let's turn the game around, and instead of starting with the rotations and then shifting

24:25.820 --> 24:30.300
with the flip, we start with the flips and shift with the rotations.

24:30.300 --> 24:34.340
The subgroup generated by the flip generates just two elements.

24:34.340 --> 24:38.300
The flip, and flipping again, brings you back to the neutral element.

24:38.300 --> 24:42.900
Shifting that subgroup by 6 degrees gives the 60 degree rotation, and as I've noted

24:42.900 --> 24:46.380
before, a flipped 300 degree rotation.

24:46.380 --> 24:49.980
Shift by 120 degrees and we get another two element coset.

24:49.980 --> 24:51.740
And so on.

24:51.740 --> 24:55.660
By the way, we don't need to shift by flips, since that would just again shuffle the elements

24:55.660 --> 24:59.420
in the coset around, but not affect the coset itself.

24:59.420 --> 25:03.860
In the end, we uncover a new 6-fold symmetry in the dihedral group.

25:03.860 --> 25:07.760
This diagram gives us a complete understanding of this excited symmetry, and the two-sided

25:07.760 --> 25:09.840
symmetry is also easy to grasp.

25:09.840 --> 25:14.120
But what I think is more important is what you're not seeing in these diagrams.

25:14.120 --> 25:17.500
Why is it that the group can always be organized so neatly?

25:17.500 --> 25:20.820
You know, it could have been that they are the rotations, the flipped rotations, and

25:20.820 --> 25:23.100
another weird third coset.

25:23.100 --> 25:24.460
But there isn't.

25:24.460 --> 25:29.940
Every element appears once and only once in these cosets in a neat and ordered way.

25:29.940 --> 25:32.420
Why is that?

25:32.420 --> 25:36.660
I promised you that groups are highly symmetric with respect to their subgroups, and here

25:36.660 --> 25:38.860
we have a way to quantify that.

25:38.860 --> 25:42.780
Let's say we have a group with a subgroup inside it.

25:42.780 --> 25:47.420
I want to show that the coset of the subgroups neatly partitioned the group into equally

25:47.420 --> 25:49.580
sized fragments.

25:49.580 --> 25:52.100
There are two facts that are easy to grasp.

25:52.100 --> 25:55.660
The first one is that the cosets cover the whole group, because if you want to cover

25:55.660 --> 26:00.180
any specific element, you do what I think is the most obvious idea.

26:00.180 --> 26:03.940
Shift by exactly that element.

26:03.940 --> 26:09.180
Notice how then the neutral element shifted by x gives exactly x, covering it, along with

26:09.180 --> 26:12.980
the other elements in the coset.

26:12.980 --> 26:16.380
The other fact is that all cosets are of equal size.

26:16.980 --> 26:20.860
Obviously, you don't suddenly get more elements by shifting.

26:20.860 --> 26:23.580
But you also don't get less elements.

26:23.580 --> 26:27.460
At first, it doesn't seem impossible that you'd lose elements, so to speak, by having

26:27.460 --> 26:29.940
two shifts converge the same result.

26:29.940 --> 26:34.980
But for any shift, we can also shift back to the origin with the inverse element.

26:34.980 --> 26:38.500
Look, notice how the inverse cancels here from the left.

26:38.500 --> 26:41.860
I told you our proofs would come in handy at some point.

26:41.860 --> 26:46.580
So if you can recover all original elements like this, a coset smaller than the original

26:46.580 --> 26:50.340
subgroup would now make the inverse shift suddenly give you more elements, which is

26:50.340 --> 26:51.980
also nonsense.

26:51.980 --> 26:56.260
No, it only makes sense for all cosets to have the same number of elements as the original

26:56.260 --> 27:00.420
subgroup, since each of the elements are in a one-to-one correspondence, by shift in

27:00.420 --> 27:04.100
one direction and by the inverse shift in the other direction.

27:04.100 --> 27:08.820
The only fact left to discuss that is not at all obvious is that different cosets don't

27:08.820 --> 27:09.940
overlap.

27:09.940 --> 27:11.740
But let's see.

27:11.740 --> 27:15.700
Here you shift by an element that is already in the subgroup.

27:15.700 --> 27:20.060
Since the subgroup is a closed system, the results are all in the subgroup.

27:20.060 --> 27:24.060
Or you shift by an element that is outside the subgroup.

27:24.060 --> 27:28.220
Could it happen that any result is still in the subgroup, for example z times a equals

27:28.220 --> 27:29.780
b?

27:29.780 --> 27:34.540
Canceling a from both sides and solving for z, we get that z equals b times the inverse

27:34.540 --> 27:36.180
of a.

27:36.180 --> 27:40.940
But since a is an element of the subgroup, so is the inverse of a.

27:40.940 --> 27:46.380
And since b is also an element of the subgroup, so is their product, again because of closure,

27:46.380 --> 27:48.820
so z must be 2.

27:48.820 --> 27:53.140
If we specifically assume that z is outside the subgroup, the result could have never

27:53.140 --> 27:56.180
been in the subgroup in the first place.

27:56.180 --> 28:00.620
So we have this dichotomy, where a coset either doesn't overlap with the subgroup at all,

28:00.620 --> 28:03.460
or it is the whole subgroup itself.

28:03.460 --> 28:08.100
And basically the same argument shows that this dichotomy also holds between cosets, but

28:08.100 --> 28:11.100
I won't repeat all the details here.

28:11.100 --> 28:16.060
All in all, this proves that the cosets partitioned the whole group into equally sized parts.

28:16.060 --> 28:19.980
And for finite groups we can summarize this with a really cool and very easy to remember

28:19.980 --> 28:22.980
theorem called Lagrange's theorem.

28:22.980 --> 28:28.380
Lagrange's theorem states that for a group g and a subgroup h, the order of h divides

28:28.380 --> 28:30.220
the order of g.

28:30.220 --> 28:32.140
And we've seen this, right?

28:32.140 --> 28:36.780
d6 has 12 elements and the subgroup of rotations has 6.

28:36.780 --> 28:42.580
Because we have now rigorously proven that the rotations partition d6, 6 has to divide

28:42.580 --> 28:44.180
12.

28:44.180 --> 28:50.860
Or if we take a look at the cyclic group with 6 elements, it has subgroups of order 3, 2,

28:50.860 --> 28:51.860
and 1.

28:51.860 --> 28:56.300
And there cannot be subgroups of order 5 or 4.

28:56.300 --> 29:02.340
Fun fact about Lagrange's theorem, Lagrange died before group theory was even invented,

29:02.340 --> 29:05.740
makes you wonder how he got his name attached to group theory theorem.

29:05.740 --> 29:08.220
Eh, it's complicated.

29:08.220 --> 29:11.500
And it's not like abstract algebra is known for good naming.

29:11.500 --> 29:15.180
Anyway, so what is this theorem useful for?

29:15.180 --> 29:21.140
Can you imagine the consequences this theorem has for a group with prime order p?

29:21.140 --> 29:28.180
Since primes can only be divided by 1 and p, a subgroup can only have 1 or p elements.

29:28.180 --> 29:34.300
Now, take any element that is not the neutral element, let's call it a, and start generating

29:34.300 --> 29:35.980
its subgroup.

29:35.980 --> 29:40.740
That subgroup contains more than one element, and therefore has to contain all p elements.

29:40.740 --> 29:45.980
So after we eventually reach the neutral element, we will have filled the whole group.

29:45.980 --> 29:50.900
This makes it eerily similar to the cyclic group, so here's a trick.

29:50.900 --> 29:54.540
Instead of the letter a, what if I use this symbol?

29:54.540 --> 29:59.380
And instead of this weird circle operation, what if I write plus?

29:59.380 --> 30:04.860
Then a squared becomes 1 plus 1, which we humans write as 2.

30:04.860 --> 30:09.540
And a cube becomes 1 plus 1 plus 1, which we encode with this symbol.

30:09.540 --> 30:12.740
A to the 4 becomes 4 and so on.

30:12.740 --> 30:16.060
And for e, let me use the digit 0.

30:16.060 --> 30:19.700
So only through relabeling, we got the cyclic group.

30:19.700 --> 30:24.220
But how I write down my group doesn't change anything about the group itself, right?

30:24.220 --> 30:29.580
Which means that any group of prime order, no matter how abstract, has to be the cyclic

30:29.580 --> 30:30.580
group.

30:30.580 --> 30:33.860
When I saw this, I felt like I understood group theory.

30:33.860 --> 30:38.420
Yeah, we could spend all of our time with abstract groups, but it is also possible with

30:38.420 --> 30:43.060
the sheer structural loan we get from the four axioms and the small size requirement

30:43.060 --> 30:46.060
to create very concrete examples.

30:46.060 --> 30:51.060
It made me want to go on a quest to uncover the hidden structure of groups of any order.

30:51.060 --> 30:56.220
I claim that, with what you've learned in this video, you can guess, maybe even prove,

30:56.220 --> 31:00.500
what all the groups of order 6 are, and with the upcoming videos, we'll tackle the problem

31:00.500 --> 31:03.140
of uncovering all the groups.

31:03.140 --> 31:07.140
Wait a minute, weren't we originally trying to solve the graph isomorphism problem?
