1. **Group Axioms**: A group is a set equipped with an operation (usually denoted as "×" or "⋅") that combines any two elements of the set to produce another element in the set, satisfying four fundamental properties: closure, associativity, the existence of an identity element, and the existence of inverse elements.

2. **Subgroups**: A subgroup is a subset of a group that itself forms a group under the same operation. Subgroups are important because they can help us understand the structure of the larger group.

3. **Cosets**: Given a group G and a subgroup H, each element of G can be expressed as either an element of H or as h * h^(-1) where h is an element of H and h^(-1) is its inverse. This partitioning of the group into left cosets by the subgroup is one-to-one with the right cosets, meaning each coset is represented exactly once in either form.

4. **Lagrange's Theorem**: In any finite group G, the order (number of elements) of every subgroup divides the order of G. This theorem is a direct consequence of the fact that every group element can be written as a product of elements from the subgroup and elements from the cosets.

5. **Groups of Prime Order**: A group of prime order p has exactly p elements, and any non-neutral element in such a group generates the entire group by its powers (similar to a cyclic group of order p). This is because a subgroup can only have 1 or p elements due to Lagrange's theorem.

6. **Cyclic Groups**: A cyclic group of order n is generated by a single element (a generator) such that the group consists of all powers of this generator, including the neutral element and the inverse of the generator if the group is not of prime order.

7. **Concrete Examples vs. Abstract Groups**: While abstract groups can be quite complex, all groups can be described concretely using specific elements and operations. For example, a group of prime order can be made concrete by defining an operation that makes it cyclic, similar to how we relate the symmetric group S_3 to the dihedral group D_6.

8. **The Graph Isomorphism Problem**: We started with the goal of understanding when two graphs are isomorphic, which led us to explore the concept of symmetry groups and eventually to the abstract concept of a group. The study of groups has shown that many seemingly disparate mathematical structures can be understood through this lens.

In summary, we've seen how the structure of groups, especially their subgroups and cosets, leads to deep insights into the nature of symmetry and the classification of mathematical structures, which includes solving problems like graph isomorphism by understanding the underlying group actions.
