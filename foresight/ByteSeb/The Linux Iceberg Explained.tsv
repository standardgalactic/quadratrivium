0	7120	A while ago, I made a video explaining the Windows Iceberg, but because I am an average
7120	13000	operating system enjoyer, this time I bring you the Linux Iceberg Explained.
13000	17960	Before we begin, I invite you to subscribe and leave a comment if you like the video.
17960	20320	I always heart comments.
20320	26000	Hello world, but it's severe.
26000	31920	If you're new to the channel, I make videos about tech, software and everything in between.
31920	37640	I made this Iceberg by myself and with the help of some pretty cool Reddit users over
37640	44440	at r slash Linux master race that gave me some ideas to include them in this video.
44440	49880	You'll have the original thread in the description below just in case you want to check it out.
49880	54580	The Iceberg has 5 tiers, each one containing 10 topics.
54580	57820	So in total we have 50 topics.
57820	61820	This video is going to be a long one, so let's begin.
61820	65520	Tier 1 Linux
65520	69380	It is a monolithic kernel, written by Linus Torboltz.
69380	75580	Its main characteristic is that it is licensed under the GPL license that makes it free and
75580	76860	open source.
76860	81940	This means that everyone can contribute to the development or even make its own modified
81940	83340	versions of it.
83340	89660	In 1991 Linus started working on the kernel as a hobby when he was attending the University
89660	97020	of Helsinki with the goal of creating a system like Minix that is a Unix operating system.
97020	102580	That is why Linux shares a lot of similarities with Unix and it is considered a Unix-like
102580	103580	system.
103580	110420	The name Linux was adopted from its creator's first name, just replacing the S with an X.
110420	118640	At the time of this recording the latest stable version of the kernel is 5.17.
118640	120140	Distributions
120140	125300	A Linux distribution is an operating system that uses the Linux kernel.
125300	129460	There are about 500 active Linux distributions.
129460	135380	Right now you are seeing the Linux distribution timeline that shows all of the Linux distros
135380	137940	when they were made and what they are based on.
137940	144960	The main Linux distros are Debian, Snugware, Ubuntu, Red Hat or Fedora, Orch Linux and
144960	145960	Gintu.
145960	149340	Usually there are distributions for every use case.
149340	153820	For example, Orch Linux and Gintu are for very advanced users.
153820	161420	Linux Mint welcomes beginners and Ubuntu Touch is specialized for mobile devices.
161420	163580	Desktop environment
163700	169340	A desktop environment is a graphical user interface that comes with some software installed
169340	175300	that is useful for the user, like a disk manager, a calculator or a settings app.
175300	180220	Every desktop environment has a different amount of customization and they follow their
180220	181820	own guidelines.
181820	187460	The most popular desktop environments are GNOME, KDE, Plasma and XFCE.
187460	192700	Some distros tend to customize the desktop environments to a certain degree to match
192700	194420	with their aesthetic.
194420	200540	Like the modifications that Ubuntu or Papua make to GNOME like adding a dock.
200540	204900	Some distros even make forks of other desktop environments.
204900	208660	This is the case of Cinnamon and Mate.
208660	209660	Package Manager
209660	215900	A package manager is a software that takes care of installing, removing and updating
215900	217140	your packages.
217140	221940	A package is a collection of files that usually are for a program.
221940	227940	For example, Debian and Ubuntu-based distros use apt, the advanced package tool.
227940	234020	Tatora uses DNF that stands for Dendafar Jam and Arch Linux uses Pac-Man.
234020	237380	Yes, like the game character.
237380	239260	SteamDoc
239260	246900	The SteamDoc is a handheld gaming PC developed by Valve and AMD, released on February 25th
246900	248900	of 2022.
248900	255860	This device runs SteamOS 3.0 that is a Linux distribution made by Valve based on Arch Linux.
255860	261540	This console runs native Linux games, of course, but it also uses the Proton compatibility
261540	264980	layer to be able to run a lot of Windows games.
264980	269820	And because Windows has a big catalog and also considering that you can set up console
269820	275260	emulators, it makes the SteamDoc look like a very promising device.
275260	278860	Some people, including me, have the hope that it will increase the performance of the game
278860	284940	and increase the Linux market share enough for developers to start caring about it.
284940	287380	Linus Torbolts
287380	291460	Linus Torbolts is the creator and main developer of Linux.
291460	298420	He was born on December 28th, 1969, being today 52 years old.
298420	304820	Some people don't know that he also was the creator of Git that stands for Global Information
304820	305820	Tracker.
305820	310700	In addition, it is an open source version controlled system that it is used for a lot
310700	314980	of big software projects, most developers use it.
314980	320820	Linus is also known in the Linux community for disliking a lot the company and video
320820	326140	due to the difficulty of working with them and the mediocre support that they offer
326140	327860	to the system.
327860	334220	She even showed the middle finger to them publicly and said the F word.
334220	336220	Tux
336220	338300	Tux is Linux's mascot.
338300	340620	It is a penguin with a slight smile.
340620	346400	It gets that name because penguins look like they're wearing a tuxedo and tux is a nickname
346400	347400	for that.
347400	350300	I mean, I guess that you can see the similarity.
350300	355220	Also, James Hughes said that this name stood for 12 volts unix.
355220	363420	In 1996, Linus Torbolts saw this exact image on an FPT server and he liked it so much that
363420	366780	it ended up being the inspiration for Tux.
366780	373340	Eventually, Larry E. Wang submitted what would be the final Linux mascot designed to a Linux
373340	375100	logo contest.
375100	378900	To the sign that he used the first version of GIMP.
378900	383540	Interestingly, Tux is not the logo of Linux but the mascot.
383540	388780	This is because Tux did not win any of the logo competitions but pretty much everyone
388780	392060	nowadays relates a penguin with Linux.
392060	394980	There are multiple variations of the design.
394980	397100	Here you are seeing a couple of them.
397100	400820	But to be honest, my favorite one is the original design.
400820	404260	The penguin was actually not the first proposed design.
404260	410200	Alan Mackie made this concept for an alternate mascot, being this fox.
410200	416200	Something pretty cool that I found while researching about this was that to raise money for a charity
416200	422760	to help people that had been affected by a flood in Australia, Queensland, a flight took
422760	426600	place and brought a Tux plush to the space.
426600	431280	Of course, you have the complete video in the description.
431280	434480	DistroWatch and DistroChooser
434480	440840	DistroWatch.com is a website that ranks Linux and VSD distributions depending on how much
440840	442360	people use them.
442360	448440	Based on how many times the download button is clicked on the official distro's website,
448440	453160	most people use it to see how popular a distro is.
453160	459520	DistroChooser.de is another website whose purpose is to guide new users and help them
459520	463400	to choose a Linux distro that suits their needs.
463400	469920	It asks you some questions to know your preferences like the use case or if you prefer a Windows
469920	471720	or Mac interface.
471720	476440	I recommend you to go and visit it if you're planning on installing a distro.
476440	480200	But if you don't know exactly which one.
480200	485480	Richard Stolman Richard Matthew Stolman is an American computer
485480	492000	programmer that was born on March 16, 1953 in New York.
492000	498360	He is the founder of the non-profit organization Free Software Foundation that promotes free
498360	500320	and open source software.
500320	503400	The goal can be summarized in one phrase.
503400	509960	The users should have the freedom to run, edit, contribute to and share the software.
509960	516200	Stolman also worked on the GNU project, same one that we're going to talk about in a minute.
516200	522600	Lately he has been a very controversial person because in 2019 he made some comments about
522600	528360	a victim of that millionaire whose last name is similar to Einstein.
528360	530520	You know who I am referring to.
530520	537040	Later that month he resigned from the MIT and the Free Software Foundation but in 2021
537040	539960	he returned to the board of directors.
539960	545440	This was met with a lot of discussion again as a letter was published on GitHub asking
545440	551840	for the removal of Richard Stolman from the Free Software Foundation backed by organizations
551840	557920	like GNU and Mozilla but they have not achieved what they wanted.
557920	563240	GNU The GNU project started by Richard Stolman in
563240	570840	1983 because he wanted to create a free open source operating system alternative to UNIX.
570840	576520	GNU extends for GNU's not UNIX, making it a recursive acronym.
576520	583520	It has a collection of 459 free and open source software packages essential for an operating
583520	585200	system to work.
585200	592120	Some components of GNU are the GNU compiler collection, the GNU C Library, the GNU Debugger,
592120	595600	the GNU Core Utilities and the GNU Vashal.
595600	601560	One of the most important contributions of the GNU project is the GPAL license that stands
601560	604720	for GNU General Public License.
604720	610360	This allows software to be registered under a completely free license that forces everyone
610360	615840	that modifies the project to also make its modifications open source.
615840	622440	The GNU project was originally developing its own microkernel called GNU HURT but sadly
622440	629000	after 32 years it is still not ready due to a high amount of bugs and missing features.
629000	635320	Now, remember that Linux is essentially just a kernel, so we need some software like GNU
635320	638680	to be a fully working operating system.
638680	644160	And because of the poor state of GNU HURT, basically everyone that wanted a free system
644160	650200	started to use Linux with GNU because it was a working free kernel and that's how we get
650200	654960	what you've probably heard, GNU slash Linux.
654960	657560	Tier 2.
657560	662200	Linux Markiture According to StatCounter, a website that
662200	669920	takes care of registering web analytics, Linux has a desktop market share of 2.2%, and if
669920	677360	you count Chrome OS as a Linux distro then its 2.8% summed up gives us a total market
677360	680120	share of about 5%.
680120	688720	If we compare them to the 75% and 15% that Windows and macOS represent, it is very little.
688720	694560	However, things change when we take a look at the mobile OS with most market share and
694560	699560	that is Android with 70% of the devices running it.
699560	708040	And Linux and other Unix-like systems represent the 77-80% of the public servers market share.
708040	714640	So basically, Linux runs on most devices but desktop computers.
714640	719360	Chrome OS Chrome OS is a proprietary operating system
719360	726480	that uses the Linux kernel and it is focused on being simple, easy to use and lightweight.
726480	732600	It achieves the last thing mentioned because basically Chrome OS is Chrome on top of the
732600	737880	game 2 Linux distro and the apps are just progressive web apps.
737880	743280	Over time, this OS has gotten more complete with the ability to run Android apps with
743280	749640	Google Play services very well and even Linux apps, making it a rather interesting option
749640	754120	for beginners or for people with a low end computer.
754120	759480	Similar to Android, this project is based on more bare bones, open source version of
759480	762360	it called Chromium OS.
762360	767920	Chromium OS is exclusive for Chromebooks but recently a new version came out called Chromium
767920	773040	OS Flux that makes you able to install it on any supported computer.
773040	778800	I was actually making a video about the installation and everything and it got cancelled because
778800	784880	it was such a pain to get it to work starting with the flashing tool that Google provides
784880	791280	that always fails and won't work on Linux and the OS is still in very early stages
791280	794800	rebooting every 5 minutes.
794800	799080	Shell A shell is a program that includes a command
799080	804360	line interface, making you able to execute commands and programs.
804360	810240	Bash is the GNU project's shell, standing for Born Again Shell.
810240	817480	Most UNIX like OSs use it by default like macOS, Linux and FreeBSD.
817480	823000	There are other alternative shells that try to fit the necessities of other users like
823000	829600	the fish shell that features other suggestions based on history or the sea shell that also
829600	832920	has improvements over Bash.
832920	836040	I use Orch by the way.
836040	842200	This is a very popular phrase in the Linux community, so much that it has become a meme.
842200	848320	Orch Linux is a distribution that came out in 2002 and that is known for being mainly
848320	853480	for advanced users because you have to set up everything yourself.
853480	863120	In 2011 the Twitter user xylid0l published this meme of a guy asking a girl if she knows
863120	870080	that he uses Orch Linux, being one of the first mentions found about this meme, but the first
870080	876480	one that actually used the phrase itself is believed to be this one, a post on our slash
876480	884080	linux master race in 2017 using the mocking spongebob format, making fun of users that
884080	886000	comment the catchphrase.
886000	891440	Nowadays it is basically just used ironically and people have modified it to mention the
891440	896960	distro that they use, for example I use Fedora by the way.
897040	900560	I'd like to interject for a moment.
900560	905560	This is another phrase that became a meme and it is just as a copypasta.
905560	911880	People use it as a satirical reply to people who call GNU slash Linux just Linux.
911880	917440	I actually could not find the exact origin of the phrase and in the install game to
917440	923760	wiki it says that it is actually a fictional phrase attributed to Richard Stolman, but
923760	928840	I've seen some people on reddit saying that it was from a real conference where he actually
928840	931280	interjected.
931280	937520	To this copypasta a user frequently replies with another one also believed to be fictional
937520	939880	that contradicts the first one.
939880	944720	I was planning to read the whole copypasta but I suspect that this video is already getting
944720	950720	long enough so you'll have to conform yourselves with just the screenshot.
950720	953680	File System Hierarchy Standard
953680	960280	The File System Hierarchy Standard or FHS is a convention for how a Unix-like system
960280	961280	is structured.
961280	967600	It all starts with the redirect tree that is the parent of all the other direct trees.
967600	972040	I am going to tell you a little bit about what the main folders are for.
972040	976640	Slashben has essential command binaries like cat or ls.
976640	980600	Slashboot contains all the bootloader files.
980600	984520	In SlashDep you find all your connected devices.
984520	989440	This is why you might have heard the phrase that everything is a file because devices
989440	994360	and other stuff that you wouldn't have thought about are actually files.
994360	1001240	Slashetc stands for etc and you usually find system-wide config files in here.
1001240	1007960	SlashHome is the user's home directory where they store documents, downloads and that stuff.
1007960	1012160	SlashLev is where the libraries for programs are stored.
1012160	1018360	SlashMedia is the default mount point for removable drives like USB or SUD.
1018360	1024440	SlashMNT is a directory where you usually would manually install your drives.
1024440	1029680	SlashOpt is where you store the optional applications packages.
1029680	1034360	SlashSben saves all the essential system binaries.
1034360	1041600	SlashProc stores all the processes that are actually files because again everything gets a file.
1041600	1045520	SlashRoot is the root user's home directory.
1045520	1052760	SlashTMP stores all the temporary files like when you create a new unsafe document.
1052760	1059280	SlashUSR contains the majority of multi-user utilities and applications.
1059280	1066480	SlashBar has all the files that are expected to change at runtime like locks.
1066480	1068920	Raspberry Pi
1068920	1074200	Raspberry Pi is a very small and cheap computer that runs Linux.
1074200	1079000	Usually Raspberry OS, previously called Raspbian.
1079000	1084800	It is used for a wide variety of projects because you can program it and modify it.
1084800	1091480	People have created handheld gaming consoles with these or have even set up a Minecraft server.
1091480	1098960	There are several models of Raspberry Pi's but the cheapest one is the Raspberry Pi Zero version 1
1098960	1102840	that costs about $5.
1102840	1106400	Run Windows Software on Linux
1106400	1112400	There are three main ways of running Windows software on Linux or alongside with it.
1112400	1127120	The first one is Wine. Wine stands for Wine is not an emulator and it is a compatibility layer that allows you to run Windows apps on Pasek's compliant systems like macOS, Linux and BSD.
1127120	1139280	Wine translates the Windows API calls into Pasek's calls at runtime which gets rid of all the performance decrease that you would get for running for example a virtual machine.
1139280	1147360	Other technologies like Proton are based on Wine and tools like Bottles make it very easy to use this technology.
1147360	1157160	The downside is that because Windows is closed source, developers are basically trying to mimic how it works without knowing exactly how it works.
1157160	1166840	This makes Wine not a very perfect compatibility layer so you could have some issues with it and software like Drivers will not work with it.
1166840	1177920	I'd say that for basic stuff it is impressive how good it is and I haven't had any issue with it but maybe for some more complex stuff it won't work properly.
1177920	1185560	The second way of running Windows apps on Linux is with a virtual machine with Kimu, KVM and GPU pass-through.
1185560	1194160	As I've told you, running a virtual machine makes the performance worse but if you figure out how to make a virtual machine with GPU pass-through
1194160	1205680	this VM will directly communicate with your GPU making graphics related tasks like gaming almost as good as if you were running the software directly on your machine.
1205680	1223040	Unfortunately for now, enabling this is not so easy for the average user as you'll have to run some scripts, some commands and change configuration files but it is the definitive answer for running basically every Windows program that you want to own Linux.
1223040	1237960	Another not-so-usual downside is that specific programs like the ones Skool would give you to prevent you from cheating on a test will try to detect if you're on a virtual machine so that is another thing you'll have to deal with.
1237960	1253440	And the last way to run Windows software is to not run it on Linux directly but alongside with it, more specifically to have a Linux partition with all your usual stuff and a Windows partition with all the Windows exclusive software.
1253440	1281240	When you boot up your computer, Grub will let you choose what OS it should boot. This is called dual booting and it is very easy to do as beginner-friendly distros will help you to do it when you're installing them but be careful because I've heard a lot that if you install Linux and Windows on the same drive when Windows updates it will detect your Linux partition and will format it along with Grub.
1281360	1287600	I wonder if Microsoft does this on purpose. The solution is to install them on different drives.
1288760	1289720	NeoFetch
1290880	1307920	NeoFetch is a command line interface program made by the user DylanEverApps registered under the MIT license. That one executed tells you a summary of information about your system like what distribution you're running,
1308080	1324000	on what hardware, and how many packages you have installed. To be honest, the main thing that people use it for is to brag after installing Arch or any Horde distro or actually to brag about any distro that you're using in general.
1325160	1326040	TTY
1327040	1339680	TTY stands for Teletype Grader and it is an abstract device in Unix-like systems at the kernel level that presents you with a command line prompt where you can execute commands.
1339720	1353840	There are six TTYs and you can access one by pressing Ctrl plus Alt plus F3. Usually a TTY is used for troubleshooting when your graphical user interface is not available.
1354840	1355840	Tier 3
1357240	1359640	Do As I Say by Linus
1360840	1378840	On November 9th, 2021, one of the most popular YouTube tech channels, Linus Tech Tips, started a series of videos where Linus and Luke from Linus Media Group challenge each other to leave Windows behind and to switch to Linux for one month.
1378840	1400840	Linus, being an advanced Windows user and knowing not a lot about Linux, faced some issues throughout the whole series, but the one that became a meme was when he was trying to install a Steam on Linux, more specifically on Pop-Awas, by using the PopShop, a program where you get your software from different repositories.
1400840	1414840	It is known that the PopShop can be very buggy sometimes and this happened at the worst moment because when Linus installed Steam, he was presented with an error, being forced to install it via the terminal.
1414840	1430840	This is one for some reason when executing the command sudo apt-get install steam, it intends to delete the whole desktop environment, asking for confirmation with the phrase yes, do as I say.
1430840	1442840	Linus, very confused, typed that thing, nooking his entire OS, forcing him to try out another desktop that did not have these issues.
1443840	1445840	Windows subsystem for Linux
1446840	1457840	WSL is short for, well, Windows subsystem for Linux and it is basically a program that you install from the Microsoft Store on Windows 10 or 11.
1457840	1470840	That allows you to choose from a wide variety of distros like Ubuntu or Color Linux and run Linux apps on Windows, creating a whole subsystem with its respective files inside Windows.
1470840	1483840	At first, it only ran command line interface apps like nano or some scripts, but with the release of the Windows subsystem for Linux 2, it got the ability to also run GUI apps.
1483840	1494840	This is useful mainly for developers and an average user may not even know about this, but some people claim that this is Microsoft trying to kill the Linux desktop.
1494840	1503840	Using the very known technique of embrace, extend and extinguish, that Microsoft has used with Netscape, for example.
1503840	1513840	I don't really know what to think about this last theory, but as far as I know, the Linux compatibility is not really perfect and has limitations.
1513840	1515840	Thailand Window Managers
1516840	1526840	A Window Manager is a system software that takes care of controlling the placement and appearance of your windows in your graphical user interface.
1526840	1537840	With this in mind, a Thailand Window Manager is a Window Manager that tries to take advantage of order screen real estate by opening programs in different sizes.
1537840	1549840	For example, if you open a first window, it will appear maximized, but if you open a second window, the first one will take half of the screen, same as the second one and so on.
1549840	1554840	The downside is that you cannot take a window freely and move it whatever you want.
1554840	1563840	In case that you need to do something like this, you are better off using a floating Window Manager that does allow this type of behavior.
1563840	1568840	So it is not a surprise that only advanced users tend to use them.
1568840	1578840	A good amount of people prefer Thailand Window Managers instead of using full desktop environments, creating a debate of which one is better.
1578840	1590840	The most popular Thailand Window Managers are I3, DWM, OZM or Zwei, X11 and Wayland, Pulse Audio and Pipe Wire.
1590840	1597840	X11 or Xorg is a window and system created way back in 1987.
1597840	1601840	It is the default display protocol for most distros.
1601840	1612840	The way that it works is that the programs communicate with the X11 server before the compositor can generate the window that is needed for the application to render properly.
1612840	1616840	It is reliable but very slow by modern standards.
1616840	1621840	Wayland is another display protocol whose goal is to replace X11.
1621840	1632840	The way it works is by using client-side rendering, allowing the programs to communicate directly with the compositor that it wishes to render a window for.
1632840	1648840	This makes Wayland faster than Xorg, but there are some problems currently, like screen recording, that needs pipe wire to work properly because in Wayland, windows are encapsulated and some programs rely heavily on X11.
1648840	1654840	About Pulse Audio, it is a sound server for Pasek's operating systems.
1654840	1661840	This one is also the default for most distros and in most use cases it works just fine.
1661840	1672840	Even though I've heard that some people have had problems with it, by default it is configured to automatically detect all sound colleagues and manage them.
1672840	1682840	Taking control of all the detected also devices and rendering all audio streams to itself, making it the central configuration point.
1682840	1691840	But for low latency tasks like audio production, it is necessary to use a professional sound server API called JAG.
1691840	1697840	Pipe wire is a new server that handles not only audio but also video.
1697840	1709840	It features some advantages of Pulse Audio, delivering a better security model that allows isolation between applications and secure access from within containers.
1709840	1717840	It is also able to accommodate the professional use case, being able to replace JAG due to its low latency.
1717840	1722840	I mentioned these technologies together because they seem to be in a similar state.
1722840	1728840	New tag trying to replace all tag but they're not 100% there for all people.
1728840	1739840	Even though distros like Fedora already include Wayland and Pipe wire by default, so it is just a matter of time until all distros start using them.
1739840	1742840	Destructive commands
1742840	1749840	In Linux, the terminal is a very useful, powerful and dangerous tool if you do not know how to use it.
1749840	1757840	Trolls on the internet usually share destructive commands to new users and they end up destroying their systems.
1757840	1760840	Today, I'm just going to show you three of them.
1760840	1763840	Let's begin with this thing.
1763840	1774840	Yeah, I know, looks like a lot of gibberish but you're actually declaring a function that inside of it calls itself and sends that output again to itself.
1774840	1776840	This last thing runs in the background.
1776840	1787840	The last character calls that function creating a loop that'll end up wasting all your resources and freezing up your computer, forcing you to restore it.
1787840	1796840	This other command clears all the partitions that you have on your SDH drive where you usually have the operating system installed.
1796840	1799840	And this last one is the most popular one.
1799840	1805840	sudo rm-rf slash. It deletes your root directory.
1805840	1821840	There are also some variations like the one adding a star at the end that will delete everything on the root and because of the Unix-like file system, this will delete all your data and all your connected drives.
1821840	1824840	Linux phones
1824840	1836840	This one refers to the fact that basically Android is a type of Linux because it uses the kernel, so Android phones are Linux phones, but a lot of people don't agree.
1836840	1839840	This is where real Linux phones come in.
1839840	1850840	We're talking about phones that run an actual Linux distribution that is usually adapted to a mobile interface like Kiti, Plasma Mobile or Fosh.
1850840	1854840	An example of these phones are the PinePhone and the Living 5.
1854840	1864840	Devices that sadly really haven't had a lot of success compared to Android or iOS, so the market for them is still very small.
1864840	1876840	With projects like Mbox or WayJoid that allow these phones to run Android apps, there is the hope that maybe they will eventually succeed, but will have to wait.
1876840	1879840	The year after Linux desktop
1879840	1883840	This is another phrase that became a meme in the community.
1883840	1899840	You see, Linux and the desktop market hasn't really had a lot of success, but there are people that hope that when it reaches a good amount of users or that when it is suitable for most needs, that is when the year after Linux desktop will be.
1899840	1912840	Some claim that it was in the 90s, others claim that in 2004, others that it was the year when you installed Linux, but still most believe that it hasn't happened yet.
1912840	1915840	Windows refund day
1916840	1935840	On February 15, 1999, it was the Windows refund day, where mainly Linux users went to Microsoft's offices to return their unused licenses of Windows that they were forced to get because they were bundled with the computer that they had bought.
1935840	1950840	This may sound funny, but actually in the end-user-license agreement for Windows, it states clearly that if the user refuses the agreement, Windows can be returned to the manufacturer and they would get a refund.
1950840	1962840	This was theoretically of course, and because almost nobody asked for a refund for Windows, manufacturers would usually refuse to make a refund because they would lose money.
1962840	1969840	At the end of the day, these users were not able to get the refunds, but it was a pretty interesting day.
1969840	1976840	MichaelMJD has a very good video about this, and I'll leave it in the comments in case that you want to watch it.
1977840	1980840	Minnesota University Band
1980840	1991840	In April 2021, two researchers from the University of Minnesota decided to submit buggy patches of the Linux kernel to study what would happen.
1991840	1996840	They even released a paper explaining what they did and what was their goal.
1996840	2006840	When the community found out, they removed the contributions that they submitted, and the whole University of Minnesota was banned from contributing to the kernel.
2006840	2013840	It was a very controversial thing when it was found, but to be honest, I do not know what they were expecting.
2015840	2017840	Librebooting
2017840	2028840	Libreboot is an open-source boot firmware founded in December of 2013 that initializes the hardware and stores a bootloader for your operating system.
2028840	2036840	One of its goals is to replace the proprietary BIOS or UF5 firmware that your computer most likely has.
2036840	2042840	It is a distribution of core boot, but with all the proprietary binary blocks removed from it,
2042840	2049840	it currently supports 32 and 64-bit systems in the ARM architecture.
2052840	2055840	Linux is free if you don't value your time
2056840	2061840	There is an old saying, Linux is free if you don't value your time.
2061840	2070840	Basically, this refers that while Linux is free, you might have to pay by spending a good amount of time learning how the system works,
2070840	2078840	getting used to it or researching how to affect some problem or how to get a program that you need working on Linux.
2078840	2085840	So you would be better off by just paying to get Windows or macOS to avoid wasting your time.
2085840	2093840	In 2018, the YouTube channel Tech Lead uploaded a controversial video where he says why he thinks that the phrase is right,
2093840	2100840	and that basically due to poor software compatibility and other reasons, Linux can be a waste of time.
2100840	2110840	This video didn't really get a lot of positive feedback and other YouTubers like mental outlaw replied to him, contradicting what he said.
2113840	2121840	VOOM is an open-source terminal-based text editor that is highly configurable and has some powerful features.
2121840	2131840	However, one of the most common complaints is that VIM has some very weird shortcuts and that a lot of beginners don't really know how to exit VIM.
2131840	2137840	This has become a meme not only among Linux users but also programmers in general.
2137840	2144840	To exit VIM, you have to exit the edit mode and enter the command mode by pressing the ESC key.
2144840	2148840	Then type a column and a queue to quit the editor.
2152840	2165840	In 2021, when Ubuntu was using its own desktop environment called Unity, Canonical added a new feature that made it so that when you opened the Dash menu and typed something,
2165840	2173840	you would get your usual results but also web results from Amazon and its web apps were also included by default.
2173840	2184840	This was a very criticized decision because it sent your keystrokes to Amazon so much that even Richard Stallman said that Ubuntu was now a spyware.
2184840	2194840	Eventually, they removed that feature but the web apps were still present until 2020 when the Amazon shortcut that was present in the Dash was removed.
2195840	2197840	Linux is obsolete.
2197840	2207840	This refers to the great debate that interest toward Tannenbaum, the creator of Linux and Linus Torbolts had in 1992,
2207840	2217840	with Tannenbaum claiming that Linux was obsolete because it is a monolith kernel and that micro kernels like the one Linux has are far superior
2217840	2224840	because they offer better portability, that means that they are easier to port to other architectures.
2224840	2232840	The debate with its reply became more complex and a little more intense, with some people thinking it was a fine war.
2232840	2238840	Linus sent an email to apologize but the debate is still alive to this day.
2238840	2242840	You can read all the replies in the link in the description below.
2243840	2245840	Linux on Mars
2246840	2258840	On February 19th, 2021, NASA landed a rover called Perseverance on Mars after surviving a 7 minute plunge through the Martian atmosphere
2258840	2267840	because there was a delay of 11 minutes between Earth and Mars so it had to deal with it with a set of pre-programmed instructions.
2267840	2279840	Along with Perseverance, there was another invention, the Ingenuity Mars helicopter, whose objective was to become the first powered flight on any other planet than Earth
2279840	2284840	and it runs Linux so now you can say that Linux made it to Mars.
2285840	2287840	Device of Community
2288840	2294840	If you've been present in the Linux community, you might know that it can be a little bit divisive.
2294840	2302840	A lot of people are always arguing what desktop environment, package manager or text editor is the best.
2302840	2308840	Some of them think that it makes them superior or something but unironically.
2308840	2319840	Some examples of this are Linux Mint vs Ubuntu, GNOME vs KDE, Plasma or desktop environment vs Thailand window managers in general,
2319840	2323840	Pacman vs Apt and Veeam vs Emacs.
2324840	2326840	Linux later
2327840	2335840	On Linux, to run Windows apps we have Wine but systems like FreeBSD also have their own compatibility layer.
2335840	2341840	In this case, they have one called Linux later to specifically run Linux programs.
2342840	2345840	It does not involve emulation or virtual machines.
2345840	2354840	This is mainly useful to run programs like Steam that don't have a version for FreeBSD but do have one for Linux.
2355840	2358840	Windows kernel replaced with Linux
2359840	2370840	In 2020, Eric Raymond published an article where he says why he thinks that Windows will eventually replace its anti-kernel with the Linux kernel.
2370840	2375840	Running all the Windows programs with a compatibility layer like Wine.
2375840	2385840	As hints that this was going to happen he says that the Microsoft Edge port to Linux is one of them and also the Windows subsystem for Linux.
2385840	2393840	This became news rapidly and a lot of people were actually starting to believe that Microsoft was going to replace the kernel.
2393840	2396840	Some clickbaity articles didn't help at all.
2396840	2403840	The original article is very optimistic but there are a lot of issues if this was going to be done.
2403840	2411840	Because software like drivers are made specifically for the anti-kernel and wouldn't really work on Linux.
2411840	2414840	So I do not think that it is going to happen at all.
2418840	2423840	SystemD is a suite of basic software for Linux systems developed by Red Hat.
2423840	2429840	Among the main things it provides we can find an init system and a service manager.
2429840	2437840	Some people tend to really dislike SystemD because it is not just a replacement for the old init system.
2437840	2439840	But it is more than that.
2439840	2446840	As I've said it is a suite of software so it tries to change how everything is essentially organized.
2446840	2450840	This is the main argument why people dislike it.
2450840	2459840	Because it tries to do a lot of things going against the UNIX philosophy that states to do one thing and do it very well.
2459840	2464840	Some other people say that it is bloated and that is why they dislike it.
2465840	2469840	Ubuntu causes girl to drop out of college.
2470840	2481840	In 2009 a girl from McFarland named Abby bought an $1100 laptop from Dell to take online classes in MATC.
2481840	2487840	The issue comes when she found out that it didn't run Windows, it ran Ubuntu.
2487840	2496840	So when she tried to load the exe file from her Verizon CD to get Wi-Fi drivers I suppose it wouldn't load.
2496840	2501840	Of course because these kind of files don't run on Linux, they're for Windows.
2501840	2509840	So she wasn't able to connect to the internet to take her online classes forcing her to temporarily drop out of college.
2509840	2516840	She also found out that the laptop didn't have Microsoft Office but instead OpenOffice.
2516840	2528840	That's why she called 27 News that reported the whole incident and called Verizon that told them that they would send a tech support crew to her house to fix it.
2528840	2542840	This went viral and they even followed it up with a second part where they say that they got a lot of phone calls and messages from toxic Linux users that were insulting 27 News and Abby.
2542840	2549840	But some saying that she was lazy and that this proved that she was not ready to go to college.
2549840	2554840	She started getting hit on Facebook and things got out of hand.
2554840	2562840	The reporter even went to visit a technology consultant that showed him how Ubuntu worked and all that stuff.
2562840	2573840	It is a little bit funny how the reporters react to this story because they tried to paint Ubuntu as some sort of bootleg operating system and hassle.
2573840	2579840	Fortunately some people also offered to help her so at least there is that.
2579840	2591840	I mean I think that it really wasn't the girl's fault because believe it or not this is how the average user would react and I think that these toxic Linux fans shouldn't have her.
2592840	2595840	But I don't know let me know your opinion in the comments.
2599840	2601840	Linux from scratch.
2601840	2609840	Linux from scratch is a project that guides you with instructions to build your Linux system from source code.
2609840	2620840	It is considered one of the hardest things a Linux user can do even harder than watch Linux because you have to build all the components by yourself.
2620840	2625840	It is only recommended for advanced users to try this.
2625840	2628840	Audacity is spyware.
2628840	2642840	In 2021 a lot of open source news sites started to call Audacity a spyware because the new owner, MuseGroup, was changing the privacy policy and implementing some telemetry features.
2642840	2650840	Other news outlets have come out and they say that Audacity is not actually spyware and that it was all misunderstanding.
2650840	2655840	The only data that it collects is the operating system name and version.
2655840	2671840	The user country determined by the IP address, the CPU, error codes and crash reports to improve the program but the damage was already done and some people still have some reasons to believe that Audacity is spyware.
2671840	2676840	Personally, I still use it. I'm actually recording this video's audio with it.
2680840	2691840	As you saw in a computer hacker, this is a cherry call article from 2001 where a parent discovers that his son uses an operating system called Linux.
2691840	2703840	A hacker operating system made by a Soviet computer hacker named Langes Torbotos and tries to warn other parents so that their children won't become hackers.
2703840	2715840	The whole thing is worth reading it. It is still hilarious even after 20 years later. This has become a meme in the Linux community and they might copy pass the versions of it.
2715840	2718840	The Halloween Documents
2719840	2728840	They are a series of leaked Microsoft documents released by Eric Raymond in 1998, close to October 21st.
2728840	2743840	Hence the name. These documents contained information about how Microsoft was planning to deal with open source software and Linux, with these ones posing a threat to Microsoft's domination of the software industry.
2743840	2754840	They were suggesting different practices to disrupt the progress of open source software. The authenticity of the documents has been discussed since they came out.
2754840	2763840	But to be honest, I wouldn't really be surprised if they were actually real. It is known that Microsoft in that time really disliked Linux.
2763840	2771840	Even the former CEO of Microsoft, Steel Ballmer, in 2001 said that Linux was, quote,
2771840	2777840	a cancer that attaches itself in an intellectual property sense to everything it touches.
2778840	2780840	Temple of Us
2780840	2788840	Temple of Us is an operating system designed by Terry Davis. It is heavily themed based on the Bible.
2788840	2801840	He was schizophrenic and that led him to believe that he was communicating with God and that he told him that he needed to make an OS for God's third temple, so he started to work on the project.
2801840	2806840	Temple of Us has a 64-bit architecture with a monolithic kernel.
2806840	2819840	Other characteristics that it has is a 640x480 resolution and a 16-color display, out of this programmed with a variation of C named Holy C.
2819840	2828840	It is a very interesting piece of software that achieves things like 3D models and the final explorer with just text files.
2829840	2832840	That is impressive considering the limitations that he had.
2832840	2838840	Sadly, Terry Davis was hit by a train in 2018, leading to his death.
2838840	2852840	He had some videos that were deleted but that have been re-uploaded by other users where you can see his progress and you can also see that he had a very interesting relationship with Linux.
2852840	2859840	Because he used that as his daily driver but considered Temple of Us better than Unix systems.
2859840	2870840	That is why it is in this iceberg. Not a lot to do with Linux but people were begging me to include it and I also think that it deserves a mention.
2871840	2874840	Linux's behavior on mailing lists.
2875840	2885840	Aside from the NVIDIA's middle finger incident, it is reported that Linux torbolts could be a very rude person when people disagreed with him,
2885840	2892840	especially when developers submitted patches that Linux believed that weren't apt to his standards.
2892840	2902840	In 2018, Linus took a break from his role as the maintainer of the kernel to learn how to behave better and apologized to everyone that he offended.
2902840	2911840	One month later, he returned and decided to add a new code of conduct to stop developers from engaging in online apps.
2912840	2914840	Weird versions of Linux.
2915840	2925840	Because everyone is free to modify and make their own versions of Linux, some people have made some unusual distros from funny to weird and creepy ones.
2925840	2929840	I am going to mention just the most popular ones.
2929840	2936840	Red Star of Us is a distribution believed to be based on Fedora with the KDA Plasma desktop environment.
2936840	2945840	It is made by the North Korean government and it is the only operating system allowed there and only to certain select people.
2945840	2949840	There are multiple customizations to make it look like macOS.
2949840	2959840	Some of its components are closed source so people suspect that maybe it tracks its users and sends the data to the government.
2959840	2968840	The website that hosted the ISO image is not active so you'll have to go to any other site if you want to try it out.
2968840	2970840	Linux.
2970840	2973840	It is a distro with a very simple purpose.
2973840	2982840	If you enter any incorrect command in the terminal, it will run sudo rmrf slash store wiping all your data.
2982840	2984840	Amog OS.
2984840	2991840	In 2020 when the pandemic started, a lot of streamers made the game Among Us really popular.
2991840	2998840	So much that the phrase Amogus became a meme and this has led to the creation of Amog OS.
2998840	3002840	A distro themed like the game with a lot of references.
3002840	3005840	It even has a custom near fetch icon.
3005840	3007840	Hannah Montana Linux.
3007840	3012840	This is a distro based on Kubuntu that has a Hannah Montana theme.
3012840	3018840	That's basically it but it is such a big meme that it is often mentioned in the Linux community.
3018840	3022840	NSA's attempts to backdoor Linux.
3022840	3027840	It is a well-known fact that we are being spied on with our own tech.
3027840	3032840	Windows is closed source and we all know that it spies its users.
3032840	3037840	Android is open source, yes, but the Google Play services aren't
3037840	3041840	and most Android phones need them to function properly.
3041840	3045840	So it wouldn't be a big surprise that they were tracking us with them.
3045840	3052840	Same goes for Apple that even when it says that they don't track us, we can't really be sure
3052840	3056840	because iOS and Mac OS are closed source.
3056840	3063840	This is when you start to wonder if Linux has some sort of backdoor for any government agency like the NSA.
3063840	3068840	Well, it doesn't because if it did we would have already found out.
3068840	3073840	But that doesn't mean that the NSA has in fact tried to backdoor the kernel.
3073840	3081840	In this interview Linus Torbot is asked if the NSA has approached to him and asked him to backdoor the kernel.
3081840	3084840	Just see how he replies.
3084840	3089840	So this question, have any of you been approached by the US for a backdoor?
3092840	3093840	No.
3097840	3102840	Some say it was a joke, but others think it was real.
3102840	3109840	Linus' father, Nels Torbot, once asked the same thing and he replied with the following.
3109840	3114840	He almost posed the question when my oldest son was asked the same question.
3114840	3122840	Do, are there, has he been approached by NSA about backdoors?
3122840	3130840	Then he said no, but at the same time he nodded because then he was sort of in the legal free.
3130840	3136840	He had given the right answer and everybody understood that NSA had approached them.
3137840	3140840	Razor Fs
3140840	3151840	It is a journaling file system license under the UPLP2 license that was introduced to Linux in the version 2.4.1.
3151840	3158840	One of the features it offered was tail packing, a scheme to reduce internal fragmentation.
3158840	3161840	Why is this almost at the end of the iceberg?
3161840	3171840	Because of its creator, Hans Razor, his wife obtained a temporary restraining order against Hans in December 2004.
3171840	3180840	After he pushed her at the height of the divorce proceedings, she went missing on September 5th, 2006
3180840	3188840	and later in October 10th, 2006, Hans was arrested for ending with the life of his wife.
3188840	3191840	Debian Founders End
3191840	3199840	Ian Ashley Murdock was an American software engineer born in April 28th, 1973.
3199840	3206840	He is well known in the open source community for being the founder of the Linux distribution, Debian.
3206840	3215840	On December 28th of 2015, he started to post some very weird tweets where he said that he was going to commit.
3215840	3220840	But then he stated that he was being harassed by some police officers.
3220840	3230840	Later that day, he committed suicide due to asphyxiation caused by himself with a vacuum cleaner electrical cord.
3230840	3233840	But that is what the police believes that happened.
3233840	3239840	To this day, this is some very weird and shocking news for the Linux community.
3239840	3242840	Well, this was all for today.
3242840	3248840	If you made it this far, I really don't know how to thank you. You are helping my channel a lot.
3248840	3252840	This video took me a long time to make, but I enjoyed it.
3252840	3258840	If you'd just like me to make any other tech-related iceberg videos, let me know in the comment section.
3258840	3264840	I've been thinking about making the Android iceberg or the Google iceberg in general.
3264840	3268840	Some other option is the Apple or iPhone iceberg.
3268840	3271840	Goodbye world, see you in the next one.
3272840	3274840	Thanks for watching.
