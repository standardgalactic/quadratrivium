WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:07.120
A while ago, I made a video explaining the Windows Iceberg, but because I am an average

00:07.120 --> 00:13.000
operating system enjoyer, this time I bring you the Linux Iceberg Explained.

00:13.000 --> 00:17.960
Before we begin, I invite you to subscribe and leave a comment if you like the video.

00:17.960 --> 00:20.320
I always heart comments.

00:20.320 --> 00:26.000
Hello world, but it's severe.

00:26.000 --> 00:31.920
If you're new to the channel, I make videos about tech, software and everything in between.

00:31.920 --> 00:37.640
I made this Iceberg by myself and with the help of some pretty cool Reddit users over

00:37.640 --> 00:44.440
at r slash Linux master race that gave me some ideas to include them in this video.

00:44.440 --> 00:49.880
You'll have the original thread in the description below just in case you want to check it out.

00:49.880 --> 00:54.580
The Iceberg has 5 tiers, each one containing 10 topics.

00:54.580 --> 00:57.820
So in total we have 50 topics.

00:57.820 --> 01:01.820
This video is going to be a long one, so let's begin.

01:01.820 --> 01:05.520
Tier 1 Linux

01:05.520 --> 01:09.380
It is a monolithic kernel, written by Linus Torboltz.

01:09.380 --> 01:15.580
Its main characteristic is that it is licensed under the GPL license that makes it free and

01:15.580 --> 01:16.860
open source.

01:16.860 --> 01:21.940
This means that everyone can contribute to the development or even make its own modified

01:21.940 --> 01:23.340
versions of it.

01:23.340 --> 01:29.660
In 1991 Linus started working on the kernel as a hobby when he was attending the University

01:29.660 --> 01:37.020
of Helsinki with the goal of creating a system like Minix that is a Unix operating system.

01:37.020 --> 01:42.580
That is why Linux shares a lot of similarities with Unix and it is considered a Unix-like

01:42.580 --> 01:43.580
system.

01:43.580 --> 01:50.420
The name Linux was adopted from its creator's first name, just replacing the S with an X.

01:50.420 --> 01:58.640
At the time of this recording the latest stable version of the kernel is 5.17.

01:58.640 --> 02:00.140
Distributions

02:00.140 --> 02:05.300
A Linux distribution is an operating system that uses the Linux kernel.

02:05.300 --> 02:09.460
There are about 500 active Linux distributions.

02:09.460 --> 02:15.380
Right now you are seeing the Linux distribution timeline that shows all of the Linux distros

02:15.380 --> 02:17.940
when they were made and what they are based on.

02:17.940 --> 02:24.960
The main Linux distros are Debian, Snugware, Ubuntu, Red Hat or Fedora, Orch Linux and

02:24.960 --> 02:25.960
Gintu.

02:25.960 --> 02:29.340
Usually there are distributions for every use case.

02:29.340 --> 02:33.820
For example, Orch Linux and Gintu are for very advanced users.

02:33.820 --> 02:41.420
Linux Mint welcomes beginners and Ubuntu Touch is specialized for mobile devices.

02:41.420 --> 02:43.580
Desktop environment

02:43.700 --> 02:49.340
A desktop environment is a graphical user interface that comes with some software installed

02:49.340 --> 02:55.300
that is useful for the user, like a disk manager, a calculator or a settings app.

02:55.300 --> 03:00.220
Every desktop environment has a different amount of customization and they follow their

03:00.220 --> 03:01.820
own guidelines.

03:01.820 --> 03:07.460
The most popular desktop environments are GNOME, KDE, Plasma and XFCE.

03:07.460 --> 03:12.700
Some distros tend to customize the desktop environments to a certain degree to match

03:12.700 --> 03:14.420
with their aesthetic.

03:14.420 --> 03:20.540
Like the modifications that Ubuntu or Papua make to GNOME like adding a dock.

03:20.540 --> 03:24.900
Some distros even make forks of other desktop environments.

03:24.900 --> 03:28.660
This is the case of Cinnamon and Mate.

03:28.660 --> 03:29.660
Package Manager

03:29.660 --> 03:35.900
A package manager is a software that takes care of installing, removing and updating

03:35.900 --> 03:37.140
your packages.

03:37.140 --> 03:41.940
A package is a collection of files that usually are for a program.

03:41.940 --> 03:47.940
For example, Debian and Ubuntu-based distros use apt, the advanced package tool.

03:47.940 --> 03:54.020
Tatora uses DNF that stands for Dendafar Jam and Arch Linux uses Pac-Man.

03:54.020 --> 03:57.380
Yes, like the game character.

03:57.380 --> 03:59.260
SteamDoc

03:59.260 --> 04:06.900
The SteamDoc is a handheld gaming PC developed by Valve and AMD, released on February 25th

04:06.900 --> 04:08.900
of 2022.

04:08.900 --> 04:15.860
This device runs SteamOS 3.0 that is a Linux distribution made by Valve based on Arch Linux.

04:15.860 --> 04:21.540
This console runs native Linux games, of course, but it also uses the Proton compatibility

04:21.540 --> 04:24.980
layer to be able to run a lot of Windows games.

04:24.980 --> 04:29.820
And because Windows has a big catalog and also considering that you can set up console

04:29.820 --> 04:35.260
emulators, it makes the SteamDoc look like a very promising device.

04:35.260 --> 04:38.860
Some people, including me, have the hope that it will increase the performance of the game

04:38.860 --> 04:44.940
and increase the Linux market share enough for developers to start caring about it.

04:44.940 --> 04:47.380
Linus Torbolts

04:47.380 --> 04:51.460
Linus Torbolts is the creator and main developer of Linux.

04:51.460 --> 04:58.420
He was born on December 28th, 1969, being today 52 years old.

04:58.420 --> 05:04.820
Some people don't know that he also was the creator of Git that stands for Global Information

05:04.820 --> 05:05.820
Tracker.

05:05.820 --> 05:10.700
In addition, it is an open source version controlled system that it is used for a lot

05:10.700 --> 05:14.980
of big software projects, most developers use it.

05:14.980 --> 05:20.820
Linus is also known in the Linux community for disliking a lot the company and video

05:20.820 --> 05:26.140
due to the difficulty of working with them and the mediocre support that they offer

05:26.140 --> 05:27.860
to the system.

05:27.860 --> 05:34.220
She even showed the middle finger to them publicly and said the F word.

05:34.220 --> 05:36.220
Tux

05:36.220 --> 05:38.300
Tux is Linux's mascot.

05:38.300 --> 05:40.620
It is a penguin with a slight smile.

05:40.620 --> 05:46.400
It gets that name because penguins look like they're wearing a tuxedo and tux is a nickname

05:46.400 --> 05:47.400
for that.

05:47.400 --> 05:50.300
I mean, I guess that you can see the similarity.

05:50.300 --> 05:55.220
Also, James Hughes said that this name stood for 12 volts unix.

05:55.220 --> 06:03.420
In 1996, Linus Torbolts saw this exact image on an FPT server and he liked it so much that

06:03.420 --> 06:06.780
it ended up being the inspiration for Tux.

06:06.780 --> 06:13.340
Eventually, Larry E. Wang submitted what would be the final Linux mascot designed to a Linux

06:13.340 --> 06:15.100
logo contest.

06:15.100 --> 06:18.900
To the sign that he used the first version of GIMP.

06:18.900 --> 06:23.540
Interestingly, Tux is not the logo of Linux but the mascot.

06:23.540 --> 06:28.780
This is because Tux did not win any of the logo competitions but pretty much everyone

06:28.780 --> 06:32.060
nowadays relates a penguin with Linux.

06:32.060 --> 06:34.980
There are multiple variations of the design.

06:34.980 --> 06:37.100
Here you are seeing a couple of them.

06:37.100 --> 06:40.820
But to be honest, my favorite one is the original design.

06:40.820 --> 06:44.260
The penguin was actually not the first proposed design.

06:44.260 --> 06:50.200
Alan Mackie made this concept for an alternate mascot, being this fox.

06:50.200 --> 06:56.200
Something pretty cool that I found while researching about this was that to raise money for a charity

06:56.200 --> 07:02.760
to help people that had been affected by a flood in Australia, Queensland, a flight took

07:02.760 --> 07:06.600
place and brought a Tux plush to the space.

07:06.600 --> 07:11.280
Of course, you have the complete video in the description.

07:11.280 --> 07:14.480
DistroWatch and DistroChooser

07:14.480 --> 07:20.840
DistroWatch.com is a website that ranks Linux and VSD distributions depending on how much

07:20.840 --> 07:22.360
people use them.

07:22.360 --> 07:28.440
Based on how many times the download button is clicked on the official distro's website,

07:28.440 --> 07:33.160
most people use it to see how popular a distro is.

07:33.160 --> 07:39.520
DistroChooser.de is another website whose purpose is to guide new users and help them

07:39.520 --> 07:43.400
to choose a Linux distro that suits their needs.

07:43.400 --> 07:49.920
It asks you some questions to know your preferences like the use case or if you prefer a Windows

07:49.920 --> 07:51.720
or Mac interface.

07:51.720 --> 07:56.440
I recommend you to go and visit it if you're planning on installing a distro.

07:56.440 --> 08:00.200
But if you don't know exactly which one.

08:00.200 --> 08:05.480
Richard Stolman Richard Matthew Stolman is an American computer

08:05.480 --> 08:12.000
programmer that was born on March 16, 1953 in New York.

08:12.000 --> 08:18.360
He is the founder of the non-profit organization Free Software Foundation that promotes free

08:18.360 --> 08:20.320
and open source software.

08:20.320 --> 08:23.400
The goal can be summarized in one phrase.

08:23.400 --> 08:29.960
The users should have the freedom to run, edit, contribute to and share the software.

08:29.960 --> 08:36.200
Stolman also worked on the GNU project, same one that we're going to talk about in a minute.

08:36.200 --> 08:42.600
Lately he has been a very controversial person because in 2019 he made some comments about

08:42.600 --> 08:48.360
a victim of that millionaire whose last name is similar to Einstein.

08:48.360 --> 08:50.520
You know who I am referring to.

08:50.520 --> 08:57.040
Later that month he resigned from the MIT and the Free Software Foundation but in 2021

08:57.040 --> 08:59.960
he returned to the board of directors.

08:59.960 --> 09:05.440
This was met with a lot of discussion again as a letter was published on GitHub asking

09:05.440 --> 09:11.840
for the removal of Richard Stolman from the Free Software Foundation backed by organizations

09:11.840 --> 09:17.920
like GNU and Mozilla but they have not achieved what they wanted.

09:17.920 --> 09:23.240
GNU The GNU project started by Richard Stolman in

09:23.240 --> 09:30.840
1983 because he wanted to create a free open source operating system alternative to UNIX.

09:30.840 --> 09:36.520
GNU extends for GNU's not UNIX, making it a recursive acronym.

09:36.520 --> 09:43.520
It has a collection of 459 free and open source software packages essential for an operating

09:43.520 --> 09:45.200
system to work.

09:45.200 --> 09:52.120
Some components of GNU are the GNU compiler collection, the GNU C Library, the GNU Debugger,

09:52.120 --> 09:55.600
the GNU Core Utilities and the GNU Vashal.

09:55.600 --> 10:01.560
One of the most important contributions of the GNU project is the GPAL license that stands

10:01.560 --> 10:04.720
for GNU General Public License.

10:04.720 --> 10:10.360
This allows software to be registered under a completely free license that forces everyone

10:10.360 --> 10:15.840
that modifies the project to also make its modifications open source.

10:15.840 --> 10:22.440
The GNU project was originally developing its own microkernel called GNU HURT but sadly

10:22.440 --> 10:29.000
after 32 years it is still not ready due to a high amount of bugs and missing features.

10:29.000 --> 10:35.320
Now, remember that Linux is essentially just a kernel, so we need some software like GNU

10:35.320 --> 10:38.680
to be a fully working operating system.

10:38.680 --> 10:44.160
And because of the poor state of GNU HURT, basically everyone that wanted a free system

10:44.160 --> 10:50.200
started to use Linux with GNU because it was a working free kernel and that's how we get

10:50.200 --> 10:54.960
what you've probably heard, GNU slash Linux.

10:54.960 --> 10:57.560
Tier 2.

10:57.560 --> 11:02.200
Linux Markiture According to StatCounter, a website that

11:02.200 --> 11:09.920
takes care of registering web analytics, Linux has a desktop market share of 2.2%, and if

11:09.920 --> 11:17.360
you count Chrome OS as a Linux distro then its 2.8% summed up gives us a total market

11:17.360 --> 11:20.120
share of about 5%.

11:20.120 --> 11:28.720
If we compare them to the 75% and 15% that Windows and macOS represent, it is very little.

11:28.720 --> 11:34.560
However, things change when we take a look at the mobile OS with most market share and

11:34.560 --> 11:39.560
that is Android with 70% of the devices running it.

11:39.560 --> 11:48.040
And Linux and other Unix-like systems represent the 77-80% of the public servers market share.

11:48.040 --> 11:54.640
So basically, Linux runs on most devices but desktop computers.

11:54.640 --> 11:59.360
Chrome OS Chrome OS is a proprietary operating system

11:59.360 --> 12:06.480
that uses the Linux kernel and it is focused on being simple, easy to use and lightweight.

12:06.480 --> 12:12.600
It achieves the last thing mentioned because basically Chrome OS is Chrome on top of the

12:12.600 --> 12:17.880
game 2 Linux distro and the apps are just progressive web apps.

12:17.880 --> 12:23.280
Over time, this OS has gotten more complete with the ability to run Android apps with

12:23.280 --> 12:29.640
Google Play services very well and even Linux apps, making it a rather interesting option

12:29.640 --> 12:34.120
for beginners or for people with a low end computer.

12:34.120 --> 12:39.480
Similar to Android, this project is based on more bare bones, open source version of

12:39.480 --> 12:42.360
it called Chromium OS.

12:42.360 --> 12:47.920
Chromium OS is exclusive for Chromebooks but recently a new version came out called Chromium

12:47.920 --> 12:53.040
OS Flux that makes you able to install it on any supported computer.

12:53.040 --> 12:58.800
I was actually making a video about the installation and everything and it got cancelled because

12:58.800 --> 13:04.880
it was such a pain to get it to work starting with the flashing tool that Google provides

13:04.880 --> 13:11.280
that always fails and won't work on Linux and the OS is still in very early stages

13:11.280 --> 13:14.800
rebooting every 5 minutes.

13:14.800 --> 13:19.080
Shell A shell is a program that includes a command

13:19.080 --> 13:24.360
line interface, making you able to execute commands and programs.

13:24.360 --> 13:30.240
Bash is the GNU project's shell, standing for Born Again Shell.

13:30.240 --> 13:37.480
Most UNIX like OSs use it by default like macOS, Linux and FreeBSD.

13:37.480 --> 13:43.000
There are other alternative shells that try to fit the necessities of other users like

13:43.000 --> 13:49.600
the fish shell that features other suggestions based on history or the sea shell that also

13:49.600 --> 13:52.920
has improvements over Bash.

13:52.920 --> 13:56.040
I use Orch by the way.

13:56.040 --> 14:02.200
This is a very popular phrase in the Linux community, so much that it has become a meme.

14:02.200 --> 14:08.320
Orch Linux is a distribution that came out in 2002 and that is known for being mainly

14:08.320 --> 14:13.480
for advanced users because you have to set up everything yourself.

14:13.480 --> 14:23.120
In 2011 the Twitter user xylid0l published this meme of a guy asking a girl if she knows

14:23.120 --> 14:30.080
that he uses Orch Linux, being one of the first mentions found about this meme, but the first

14:30.080 --> 14:36.480
one that actually used the phrase itself is believed to be this one, a post on our slash

14:36.480 --> 14:44.080
linux master race in 2017 using the mocking spongebob format, making fun of users that

14:44.080 --> 14:46.000
comment the catchphrase.

14:46.000 --> 14:51.440
Nowadays it is basically just used ironically and people have modified it to mention the

14:51.440 --> 14:56.960
distro that they use, for example I use Fedora by the way.

14:57.040 --> 15:00.560
I'd like to interject for a moment.

15:00.560 --> 15:05.560
This is another phrase that became a meme and it is just as a copypasta.

15:05.560 --> 15:11.880
People use it as a satirical reply to people who call GNU slash Linux just Linux.

15:11.880 --> 15:17.440
I actually could not find the exact origin of the phrase and in the install game to

15:17.440 --> 15:23.760
wiki it says that it is actually a fictional phrase attributed to Richard Stolman, but

15:23.760 --> 15:28.840
I've seen some people on reddit saying that it was from a real conference where he actually

15:28.840 --> 15:31.280
interjected.

15:31.280 --> 15:37.520
To this copypasta a user frequently replies with another one also believed to be fictional

15:37.520 --> 15:39.880
that contradicts the first one.

15:39.880 --> 15:44.720
I was planning to read the whole copypasta but I suspect that this video is already getting

15:44.720 --> 15:50.720
long enough so you'll have to conform yourselves with just the screenshot.

15:50.720 --> 15:53.680
File System Hierarchy Standard

15:53.680 --> 16:00.280
The File System Hierarchy Standard or FHS is a convention for how a Unix-like system

16:00.280 --> 16:01.280
is structured.

16:01.280 --> 16:07.600
It all starts with the redirect tree that is the parent of all the other direct trees.

16:07.600 --> 16:12.040
I am going to tell you a little bit about what the main folders are for.

16:12.040 --> 16:16.640
Slashben has essential command binaries like cat or ls.

16:16.640 --> 16:20.600
Slashboot contains all the bootloader files.

16:20.600 --> 16:24.520
In SlashDep you find all your connected devices.

16:24.520 --> 16:29.440
This is why you might have heard the phrase that everything is a file because devices

16:29.440 --> 16:34.360
and other stuff that you wouldn't have thought about are actually files.

16:34.360 --> 16:41.240
Slashetc stands for etc and you usually find system-wide config files in here.

16:41.240 --> 16:47.960
SlashHome is the user's home directory where they store documents, downloads and that stuff.

16:47.960 --> 16:52.160
SlashLev is where the libraries for programs are stored.

16:52.160 --> 16:58.360
SlashMedia is the default mount point for removable drives like USB or SUD.

16:58.360 --> 17:04.440
SlashMNT is a directory where you usually would manually install your drives.

17:04.440 --> 17:09.680
SlashOpt is where you store the optional applications packages.

17:09.680 --> 17:14.360
SlashSben saves all the essential system binaries.

17:14.360 --> 17:21.600
SlashProc stores all the processes that are actually files because again everything gets a file.

17:21.600 --> 17:25.520
SlashRoot is the root user's home directory.

17:25.520 --> 17:32.760
SlashTMP stores all the temporary files like when you create a new unsafe document.

17:32.760 --> 17:39.280
SlashUSR contains the majority of multi-user utilities and applications.

17:39.280 --> 17:46.480
SlashBar has all the files that are expected to change at runtime like locks.

17:46.480 --> 17:48.920
Raspberry Pi

17:48.920 --> 17:54.200
Raspberry Pi is a very small and cheap computer that runs Linux.

17:54.200 --> 17:59.000
Usually Raspberry OS, previously called Raspbian.

17:59.000 --> 18:04.800
It is used for a wide variety of projects because you can program it and modify it.

18:04.800 --> 18:11.480
People have created handheld gaming consoles with these or have even set up a Minecraft server.

18:11.480 --> 18:18.960
There are several models of Raspberry Pi's but the cheapest one is the Raspberry Pi Zero version 1

18:18.960 --> 18:22.840
that costs about $5.

18:22.840 --> 18:26.400
Run Windows Software on Linux

18:26.400 --> 18:32.400
There are three main ways of running Windows software on Linux or alongside with it.

18:32.400 --> 18:47.120
The first one is Wine. Wine stands for Wine is not an emulator and it is a compatibility layer that allows you to run Windows apps on Pasek's compliant systems like macOS, Linux and BSD.

18:47.120 --> 18:59.280
Wine translates the Windows API calls into Pasek's calls at runtime which gets rid of all the performance decrease that you would get for running for example a virtual machine.

18:59.280 --> 19:07.360
Other technologies like Proton are based on Wine and tools like Bottles make it very easy to use this technology.

19:07.360 --> 19:17.160
The downside is that because Windows is closed source, developers are basically trying to mimic how it works without knowing exactly how it works.

19:17.160 --> 19:26.840
This makes Wine not a very perfect compatibility layer so you could have some issues with it and software like Drivers will not work with it.

19:26.840 --> 19:37.920
I'd say that for basic stuff it is impressive how good it is and I haven't had any issue with it but maybe for some more complex stuff it won't work properly.

19:37.920 --> 19:45.560
The second way of running Windows apps on Linux is with a virtual machine with Kimu, KVM and GPU pass-through.

19:45.560 --> 19:54.160
As I've told you, running a virtual machine makes the performance worse but if you figure out how to make a virtual machine with GPU pass-through

19:54.160 --> 20:05.680
this VM will directly communicate with your GPU making graphics related tasks like gaming almost as good as if you were running the software directly on your machine.

20:05.680 --> 20:23.040
Unfortunately for now, enabling this is not so easy for the average user as you'll have to run some scripts, some commands and change configuration files but it is the definitive answer for running basically every Windows program that you want to own Linux.

20:23.040 --> 20:37.960
Another not-so-usual downside is that specific programs like the ones Skool would give you to prevent you from cheating on a test will try to detect if you're on a virtual machine so that is another thing you'll have to deal with.

20:37.960 --> 20:53.440
And the last way to run Windows software is to not run it on Linux directly but alongside with it, more specifically to have a Linux partition with all your usual stuff and a Windows partition with all the Windows exclusive software.

20:53.440 --> 21:21.240
When you boot up your computer, Grub will let you choose what OS it should boot. This is called dual booting and it is very easy to do as beginner-friendly distros will help you to do it when you're installing them but be careful because I've heard a lot that if you install Linux and Windows on the same drive when Windows updates it will detect your Linux partition and will format it along with Grub.

21:21.360 --> 21:27.600
I wonder if Microsoft does this on purpose. The solution is to install them on different drives.

21:28.760 --> 21:29.720
NeoFetch

21:30.880 --> 21:47.920
NeoFetch is a command line interface program made by the user DylanEverApps registered under the MIT license. That one executed tells you a summary of information about your system like what distribution you're running,

21:48.080 --> 22:04.000
on what hardware, and how many packages you have installed. To be honest, the main thing that people use it for is to brag after installing Arch or any Horde distro or actually to brag about any distro that you're using in general.

22:05.160 --> 22:06.040
TTY

22:07.040 --> 22:19.680
TTY stands for Teletype Grader and it is an abstract device in Unix-like systems at the kernel level that presents you with a command line prompt where you can execute commands.

22:19.720 --> 22:33.840
There are six TTYs and you can access one by pressing Ctrl plus Alt plus F3. Usually a TTY is used for troubleshooting when your graphical user interface is not available.

22:34.840 --> 22:35.840
Tier 3

22:37.240 --> 22:39.640
Do As I Say by Linus

22:40.840 --> 22:58.840
On November 9th, 2021, one of the most popular YouTube tech channels, Linus Tech Tips, started a series of videos where Linus and Luke from Linus Media Group challenge each other to leave Windows behind and to switch to Linux for one month.

22:58.840 --> 23:20.840
Linus, being an advanced Windows user and knowing not a lot about Linux, faced some issues throughout the whole series, but the one that became a meme was when he was trying to install a Steam on Linux, more specifically on Pop-Awas, by using the PopShop, a program where you get your software from different repositories.

23:20.840 --> 23:34.840
It is known that the PopShop can be very buggy sometimes and this happened at the worst moment because when Linus installed Steam, he was presented with an error, being forced to install it via the terminal.

23:34.840 --> 23:50.840
This is one for some reason when executing the command sudo apt-get install steam, it intends to delete the whole desktop environment, asking for confirmation with the phrase yes, do as I say.

23:50.840 --> 24:02.840
Linus, very confused, typed that thing, nooking his entire OS, forcing him to try out another desktop that did not have these issues.

24:03.840 --> 24:05.840
Windows subsystem for Linux

24:06.840 --> 24:17.840
WSL is short for, well, Windows subsystem for Linux and it is basically a program that you install from the Microsoft Store on Windows 10 or 11.

24:17.840 --> 24:30.840
That allows you to choose from a wide variety of distros like Ubuntu or Color Linux and run Linux apps on Windows, creating a whole subsystem with its respective files inside Windows.

24:30.840 --> 24:43.840
At first, it only ran command line interface apps like nano or some scripts, but with the release of the Windows subsystem for Linux 2, it got the ability to also run GUI apps.

24:43.840 --> 24:54.840
This is useful mainly for developers and an average user may not even know about this, but some people claim that this is Microsoft trying to kill the Linux desktop.

24:54.840 --> 25:03.840
Using the very known technique of embrace, extend and extinguish, that Microsoft has used with Netscape, for example.

25:03.840 --> 25:13.840
I don't really know what to think about this last theory, but as far as I know, the Linux compatibility is not really perfect and has limitations.

25:13.840 --> 25:15.840
Thailand Window Managers

25:16.840 --> 25:26.840
A Window Manager is a system software that takes care of controlling the placement and appearance of your windows in your graphical user interface.

25:26.840 --> 25:37.840
With this in mind, a Thailand Window Manager is a Window Manager that tries to take advantage of order screen real estate by opening programs in different sizes.

25:37.840 --> 25:49.840
For example, if you open a first window, it will appear maximized, but if you open a second window, the first one will take half of the screen, same as the second one and so on.

25:49.840 --> 25:54.840
The downside is that you cannot take a window freely and move it whatever you want.

25:54.840 --> 26:03.840
In case that you need to do something like this, you are better off using a floating Window Manager that does allow this type of behavior.

26:03.840 --> 26:08.840
So it is not a surprise that only advanced users tend to use them.

26:08.840 --> 26:18.840
A good amount of people prefer Thailand Window Managers instead of using full desktop environments, creating a debate of which one is better.

26:18.840 --> 26:30.840
The most popular Thailand Window Managers are I3, DWM, OZM or Zwei, X11 and Wayland, Pulse Audio and Pipe Wire.

26:30.840 --> 26:37.840
X11 or Xorg is a window and system created way back in 1987.

26:37.840 --> 26:41.840
It is the default display protocol for most distros.

26:41.840 --> 26:52.840
The way that it works is that the programs communicate with the X11 server before the compositor can generate the window that is needed for the application to render properly.

26:52.840 --> 26:56.840
It is reliable but very slow by modern standards.

26:56.840 --> 27:01.840
Wayland is another display protocol whose goal is to replace X11.

27:01.840 --> 27:12.840
The way it works is by using client-side rendering, allowing the programs to communicate directly with the compositor that it wishes to render a window for.

27:12.840 --> 27:28.840
This makes Wayland faster than Xorg, but there are some problems currently, like screen recording, that needs pipe wire to work properly because in Wayland, windows are encapsulated and some programs rely heavily on X11.

27:28.840 --> 27:34.840
About Pulse Audio, it is a sound server for Pasek's operating systems.

27:34.840 --> 27:41.840
This one is also the default for most distros and in most use cases it works just fine.

27:41.840 --> 27:52.840
Even though I've heard that some people have had problems with it, by default it is configured to automatically detect all sound colleagues and manage them.

27:52.840 --> 28:02.840
Taking control of all the detected also devices and rendering all audio streams to itself, making it the central configuration point.

28:02.840 --> 28:11.840
But for low latency tasks like audio production, it is necessary to use a professional sound server API called JAG.

28:11.840 --> 28:17.840
Pipe wire is a new server that handles not only audio but also video.

28:17.840 --> 28:29.840
It features some advantages of Pulse Audio, delivering a better security model that allows isolation between applications and secure access from within containers.

28:29.840 --> 28:37.840
It is also able to accommodate the professional use case, being able to replace JAG due to its low latency.

28:37.840 --> 28:42.840
I mentioned these technologies together because they seem to be in a similar state.

28:42.840 --> 28:48.840
New tag trying to replace all tag but they're not 100% there for all people.

28:48.840 --> 28:59.840
Even though distros like Fedora already include Wayland and Pipe wire by default, so it is just a matter of time until all distros start using them.

28:59.840 --> 29:02.840
Destructive commands

29:02.840 --> 29:09.840
In Linux, the terminal is a very useful, powerful and dangerous tool if you do not know how to use it.

29:09.840 --> 29:17.840
Trolls on the internet usually share destructive commands to new users and they end up destroying their systems.

29:17.840 --> 29:20.840
Today, I'm just going to show you three of them.

29:20.840 --> 29:23.840
Let's begin with this thing.

29:23.840 --> 29:34.840
Yeah, I know, looks like a lot of gibberish but you're actually declaring a function that inside of it calls itself and sends that output again to itself.

29:34.840 --> 29:36.840
This last thing runs in the background.

29:36.840 --> 29:47.840
The last character calls that function creating a loop that'll end up wasting all your resources and freezing up your computer, forcing you to restore it.

29:47.840 --> 29:56.840
This other command clears all the partitions that you have on your SDH drive where you usually have the operating system installed.

29:56.840 --> 29:59.840
And this last one is the most popular one.

29:59.840 --> 30:05.840
sudo rm-rf slash. It deletes your root directory.

30:05.840 --> 30:21.840
There are also some variations like the one adding a star at the end that will delete everything on the root and because of the Unix-like file system, this will delete all your data and all your connected drives.

30:21.840 --> 30:24.840
Linux phones

30:24.840 --> 30:36.840
This one refers to the fact that basically Android is a type of Linux because it uses the kernel, so Android phones are Linux phones, but a lot of people don't agree.

30:36.840 --> 30:39.840
This is where real Linux phones come in.

30:39.840 --> 30:50.840
We're talking about phones that run an actual Linux distribution that is usually adapted to a mobile interface like Kiti, Plasma Mobile or Fosh.

30:50.840 --> 30:54.840
An example of these phones are the PinePhone and the Living 5.

30:54.840 --> 31:04.840
Devices that sadly really haven't had a lot of success compared to Android or iOS, so the market for them is still very small.

31:04.840 --> 31:16.840
With projects like Mbox or WayJoid that allow these phones to run Android apps, there is the hope that maybe they will eventually succeed, but will have to wait.

31:16.840 --> 31:19.840
The year after Linux desktop

31:19.840 --> 31:23.840
This is another phrase that became a meme in the community.

31:23.840 --> 31:39.840
You see, Linux and the desktop market hasn't really had a lot of success, but there are people that hope that when it reaches a good amount of users or that when it is suitable for most needs, that is when the year after Linux desktop will be.

31:39.840 --> 31:52.840
Some claim that it was in the 90s, others claim that in 2004, others that it was the year when you installed Linux, but still most believe that it hasn't happened yet.

31:52.840 --> 31:55.840
Windows refund day

31:56.840 --> 32:15.840
On February 15, 1999, it was the Windows refund day, where mainly Linux users went to Microsoft's offices to return their unused licenses of Windows that they were forced to get because they were bundled with the computer that they had bought.

32:15.840 --> 32:30.840
This may sound funny, but actually in the end-user-license agreement for Windows, it states clearly that if the user refuses the agreement, Windows can be returned to the manufacturer and they would get a refund.

32:30.840 --> 32:42.840
This was theoretically of course, and because almost nobody asked for a refund for Windows, manufacturers would usually refuse to make a refund because they would lose money.

32:42.840 --> 32:49.840
At the end of the day, these users were not able to get the refunds, but it was a pretty interesting day.

32:49.840 --> 32:56.840
MichaelMJD has a very good video about this, and I'll leave it in the comments in case that you want to watch it.

32:57.840 --> 33:00.840
Minnesota University Band

33:00.840 --> 33:11.840
In April 2021, two researchers from the University of Minnesota decided to submit buggy patches of the Linux kernel to study what would happen.

33:11.840 --> 33:16.840
They even released a paper explaining what they did and what was their goal.

33:16.840 --> 33:26.840
When the community found out, they removed the contributions that they submitted, and the whole University of Minnesota was banned from contributing to the kernel.

33:26.840 --> 33:33.840
It was a very controversial thing when it was found, but to be honest, I do not know what they were expecting.

33:35.840 --> 33:37.840
Librebooting

33:37.840 --> 33:48.840
Libreboot is an open-source boot firmware founded in December of 2013 that initializes the hardware and stores a bootloader for your operating system.

33:48.840 --> 33:56.840
One of its goals is to replace the proprietary BIOS or UF5 firmware that your computer most likely has.

33:56.840 --> 34:02.840
It is a distribution of core boot, but with all the proprietary binary blocks removed from it,

34:02.840 --> 34:09.840
it currently supports 32 and 64-bit systems in the ARM architecture.

34:12.840 --> 34:15.840
Linux is free if you don't value your time

34:16.840 --> 34:21.840
There is an old saying, Linux is free if you don't value your time.

34:21.840 --> 34:30.840
Basically, this refers that while Linux is free, you might have to pay by spending a good amount of time learning how the system works,

34:30.840 --> 34:38.840
getting used to it or researching how to affect some problem or how to get a program that you need working on Linux.

34:38.840 --> 34:45.840
So you would be better off by just paying to get Windows or macOS to avoid wasting your time.

34:45.840 --> 34:53.840
In 2018, the YouTube channel Tech Lead uploaded a controversial video where he says why he thinks that the phrase is right,

34:53.840 --> 35:00.840
and that basically due to poor software compatibility and other reasons, Linux can be a waste of time.

35:00.840 --> 35:10.840
This video didn't really get a lot of positive feedback and other YouTubers like mental outlaw replied to him, contradicting what he said.

35:13.840 --> 35:21.840
VOOM is an open-source terminal-based text editor that is highly configurable and has some powerful features.

35:21.840 --> 35:31.840
However, one of the most common complaints is that VIM has some very weird shortcuts and that a lot of beginners don't really know how to exit VIM.

35:31.840 --> 35:37.840
This has become a meme not only among Linux users but also programmers in general.

35:37.840 --> 35:44.840
To exit VIM, you have to exit the edit mode and enter the command mode by pressing the ESC key.

35:44.840 --> 35:48.840
Then type a column and a queue to quit the editor.

35:52.840 --> 36:05.840
In 2021, when Ubuntu was using its own desktop environment called Unity, Canonical added a new feature that made it so that when you opened the Dash menu and typed something,

36:05.840 --> 36:13.840
you would get your usual results but also web results from Amazon and its web apps were also included by default.

36:13.840 --> 36:24.840
This was a very criticized decision because it sent your keystrokes to Amazon so much that even Richard Stallman said that Ubuntu was now a spyware.

36:24.840 --> 36:34.840
Eventually, they removed that feature but the web apps were still present until 2020 when the Amazon shortcut that was present in the Dash was removed.

36:35.840 --> 36:37.840
Linux is obsolete.

36:37.840 --> 36:47.840
This refers to the great debate that interest toward Tannenbaum, the creator of Linux and Linus Torbolts had in 1992,

36:47.840 --> 36:57.840
with Tannenbaum claiming that Linux was obsolete because it is a monolith kernel and that micro kernels like the one Linux has are far superior

36:57.840 --> 37:04.840
because they offer better portability, that means that they are easier to port to other architectures.

37:04.840 --> 37:12.840
The debate with its reply became more complex and a little more intense, with some people thinking it was a fine war.

37:12.840 --> 37:18.840
Linus sent an email to apologize but the debate is still alive to this day.

37:18.840 --> 37:22.840
You can read all the replies in the link in the description below.

37:23.840 --> 37:25.840
Linux on Mars

37:26.840 --> 37:38.840
On February 19th, 2021, NASA landed a rover called Perseverance on Mars after surviving a 7 minute plunge through the Martian atmosphere

37:38.840 --> 37:47.840
because there was a delay of 11 minutes between Earth and Mars so it had to deal with it with a set of pre-programmed instructions.

37:47.840 --> 37:59.840
Along with Perseverance, there was another invention, the Ingenuity Mars helicopter, whose objective was to become the first powered flight on any other planet than Earth

37:59.840 --> 38:04.840
and it runs Linux so now you can say that Linux made it to Mars.

38:05.840 --> 38:07.840
Device of Community

38:08.840 --> 38:14.840
If you've been present in the Linux community, you might know that it can be a little bit divisive.

38:14.840 --> 38:22.840
A lot of people are always arguing what desktop environment, package manager or text editor is the best.

38:22.840 --> 38:28.840
Some of them think that it makes them superior or something but unironically.

38:28.840 --> 38:39.840
Some examples of this are Linux Mint vs Ubuntu, GNOME vs KDE, Plasma or desktop environment vs Thailand window managers in general,

38:39.840 --> 38:43.840
Pacman vs Apt and Veeam vs Emacs.

38:44.840 --> 38:46.840
Linux later

38:47.840 --> 38:55.840
On Linux, to run Windows apps we have Wine but systems like FreeBSD also have their own compatibility layer.

38:55.840 --> 39:01.840
In this case, they have one called Linux later to specifically run Linux programs.

39:02.840 --> 39:05.840
It does not involve emulation or virtual machines.

39:05.840 --> 39:14.840
This is mainly useful to run programs like Steam that don't have a version for FreeBSD but do have one for Linux.

39:15.840 --> 39:18.840
Windows kernel replaced with Linux

39:19.840 --> 39:30.840
In 2020, Eric Raymond published an article where he says why he thinks that Windows will eventually replace its anti-kernel with the Linux kernel.

39:30.840 --> 39:35.840
Running all the Windows programs with a compatibility layer like Wine.

39:35.840 --> 39:45.840
As hints that this was going to happen he says that the Microsoft Edge port to Linux is one of them and also the Windows subsystem for Linux.

39:45.840 --> 39:53.840
This became news rapidly and a lot of people were actually starting to believe that Microsoft was going to replace the kernel.

39:53.840 --> 39:56.840
Some clickbaity articles didn't help at all.

39:56.840 --> 40:03.840
The original article is very optimistic but there are a lot of issues if this was going to be done.

40:03.840 --> 40:11.840
Because software like drivers are made specifically for the anti-kernel and wouldn't really work on Linux.

40:11.840 --> 40:14.840
So I do not think that it is going to happen at all.

40:18.840 --> 40:23.840
SystemD is a suite of basic software for Linux systems developed by Red Hat.

40:23.840 --> 40:29.840
Among the main things it provides we can find an init system and a service manager.

40:29.840 --> 40:37.840
Some people tend to really dislike SystemD because it is not just a replacement for the old init system.

40:37.840 --> 40:39.840
But it is more than that.

40:39.840 --> 40:46.840
As I've said it is a suite of software so it tries to change how everything is essentially organized.

40:46.840 --> 40:50.840
This is the main argument why people dislike it.

40:50.840 --> 40:59.840
Because it tries to do a lot of things going against the UNIX philosophy that states to do one thing and do it very well.

40:59.840 --> 41:04.840
Some other people say that it is bloated and that is why they dislike it.

41:05.840 --> 41:09.840
Ubuntu causes girl to drop out of college.

41:10.840 --> 41:21.840
In 2009 a girl from McFarland named Abby bought an $1100 laptop from Dell to take online classes in MATC.

41:21.840 --> 41:27.840
The issue comes when she found out that it didn't run Windows, it ran Ubuntu.

41:27.840 --> 41:36.840
So when she tried to load the exe file from her Verizon CD to get Wi-Fi drivers I suppose it wouldn't load.

41:36.840 --> 41:41.840
Of course because these kind of files don't run on Linux, they're for Windows.

41:41.840 --> 41:49.840
So she wasn't able to connect to the internet to take her online classes forcing her to temporarily drop out of college.

41:49.840 --> 41:56.840
She also found out that the laptop didn't have Microsoft Office but instead OpenOffice.

41:56.840 --> 42:08.840
That's why she called 27 News that reported the whole incident and called Verizon that told them that they would send a tech support crew to her house to fix it.

42:08.840 --> 42:22.840
This went viral and they even followed it up with a second part where they say that they got a lot of phone calls and messages from toxic Linux users that were insulting 27 News and Abby.

42:22.840 --> 42:29.840
But some saying that she was lazy and that this proved that she was not ready to go to college.

42:29.840 --> 42:34.840
She started getting hit on Facebook and things got out of hand.

42:34.840 --> 42:42.840
The reporter even went to visit a technology consultant that showed him how Ubuntu worked and all that stuff.

42:42.840 --> 42:53.840
It is a little bit funny how the reporters react to this story because they tried to paint Ubuntu as some sort of bootleg operating system and hassle.

42:53.840 --> 42:59.840
Fortunately some people also offered to help her so at least there is that.

42:59.840 --> 43:11.840
I mean I think that it really wasn't the girl's fault because believe it or not this is how the average user would react and I think that these toxic Linux fans shouldn't have her.

43:12.840 --> 43:15.840
But I don't know let me know your opinion in the comments.

43:19.840 --> 43:21.840
Linux from scratch.

43:21.840 --> 43:29.840
Linux from scratch is a project that guides you with instructions to build your Linux system from source code.

43:29.840 --> 43:40.840
It is considered one of the hardest things a Linux user can do even harder than watch Linux because you have to build all the components by yourself.

43:40.840 --> 43:45.840
It is only recommended for advanced users to try this.

43:45.840 --> 43:48.840
Audacity is spyware.

43:48.840 --> 44:02.840
In 2021 a lot of open source news sites started to call Audacity a spyware because the new owner, MuseGroup, was changing the privacy policy and implementing some telemetry features.

44:02.840 --> 44:10.840
Other news outlets have come out and they say that Audacity is not actually spyware and that it was all misunderstanding.

44:10.840 --> 44:15.840
The only data that it collects is the operating system name and version.

44:15.840 --> 44:31.840
The user country determined by the IP address, the CPU, error codes and crash reports to improve the program but the damage was already done and some people still have some reasons to believe that Audacity is spyware.

44:31.840 --> 44:36.840
Personally, I still use it. I'm actually recording this video's audio with it.

44:40.840 --> 44:51.840
As you saw in a computer hacker, this is a cherry call article from 2001 where a parent discovers that his son uses an operating system called Linux.

44:51.840 --> 45:03.840
A hacker operating system made by a Soviet computer hacker named Langes Torbotos and tries to warn other parents so that their children won't become hackers.

45:03.840 --> 45:15.840
The whole thing is worth reading it. It is still hilarious even after 20 years later. This has become a meme in the Linux community and they might copy pass the versions of it.

45:15.840 --> 45:18.840
The Halloween Documents

45:19.840 --> 45:28.840
They are a series of leaked Microsoft documents released by Eric Raymond in 1998, close to October 21st.

45:28.840 --> 45:43.840
Hence the name. These documents contained information about how Microsoft was planning to deal with open source software and Linux, with these ones posing a threat to Microsoft's domination of the software industry.

45:43.840 --> 45:54.840
They were suggesting different practices to disrupt the progress of open source software. The authenticity of the documents has been discussed since they came out.

45:54.840 --> 46:03.840
But to be honest, I wouldn't really be surprised if they were actually real. It is known that Microsoft in that time really disliked Linux.

46:03.840 --> 46:11.840
Even the former CEO of Microsoft, Steel Ballmer, in 2001 said that Linux was, quote,

46:11.840 --> 46:17.840
a cancer that attaches itself in an intellectual property sense to everything it touches.

46:18.840 --> 46:20.840
Temple of Us

46:20.840 --> 46:28.840
Temple of Us is an operating system designed by Terry Davis. It is heavily themed based on the Bible.

46:28.840 --> 46:41.840
He was schizophrenic and that led him to believe that he was communicating with God and that he told him that he needed to make an OS for God's third temple, so he started to work on the project.

46:41.840 --> 46:46.840
Temple of Us has a 64-bit architecture with a monolithic kernel.

46:46.840 --> 46:59.840
Other characteristics that it has is a 640x480 resolution and a 16-color display, out of this programmed with a variation of C named Holy C.

46:59.840 --> 47:08.840
It is a very interesting piece of software that achieves things like 3D models and the final explorer with just text files.

47:09.840 --> 47:12.840
That is impressive considering the limitations that he had.

47:12.840 --> 47:18.840
Sadly, Terry Davis was hit by a train in 2018, leading to his death.

47:18.840 --> 47:32.840
He had some videos that were deleted but that have been re-uploaded by other users where you can see his progress and you can also see that he had a very interesting relationship with Linux.

47:32.840 --> 47:39.840
Because he used that as his daily driver but considered Temple of Us better than Unix systems.

47:39.840 --> 47:50.840
That is why it is in this iceberg. Not a lot to do with Linux but people were begging me to include it and I also think that it deserves a mention.

47:51.840 --> 47:54.840
Linux's behavior on mailing lists.

47:55.840 --> 48:05.840
Aside from the NVIDIA's middle finger incident, it is reported that Linux torbolts could be a very rude person when people disagreed with him,

48:05.840 --> 48:12.840
especially when developers submitted patches that Linux believed that weren't apt to his standards.

48:12.840 --> 48:22.840
In 2018, Linus took a break from his role as the maintainer of the kernel to learn how to behave better and apologized to everyone that he offended.

48:22.840 --> 48:31.840
One month later, he returned and decided to add a new code of conduct to stop developers from engaging in online apps.

48:32.840 --> 48:34.840
Weird versions of Linux.

48:35.840 --> 48:45.840
Because everyone is free to modify and make their own versions of Linux, some people have made some unusual distros from funny to weird and creepy ones.

48:45.840 --> 48:49.840
I am going to mention just the most popular ones.

48:49.840 --> 48:56.840
Red Star of Us is a distribution believed to be based on Fedora with the KDA Plasma desktop environment.

48:56.840 --> 49:05.840
It is made by the North Korean government and it is the only operating system allowed there and only to certain select people.

49:05.840 --> 49:09.840
There are multiple customizations to make it look like macOS.

49:09.840 --> 49:19.840
Some of its components are closed source so people suspect that maybe it tracks its users and sends the data to the government.

49:19.840 --> 49:28.840
The website that hosted the ISO image is not active so you'll have to go to any other site if you want to try it out.

49:28.840 --> 49:30.840
Linux.

49:30.840 --> 49:33.840
It is a distro with a very simple purpose.

49:33.840 --> 49:42.840
If you enter any incorrect command in the terminal, it will run sudo rmrf slash store wiping all your data.

49:42.840 --> 49:44.840
Amog OS.

49:44.840 --> 49:51.840
In 2020 when the pandemic started, a lot of streamers made the game Among Us really popular.

49:51.840 --> 49:58.840
So much that the phrase Amogus became a meme and this has led to the creation of Amog OS.

49:58.840 --> 50:02.840
A distro themed like the game with a lot of references.

50:02.840 --> 50:05.840
It even has a custom near fetch icon.

50:05.840 --> 50:07.840
Hannah Montana Linux.

50:07.840 --> 50:12.840
This is a distro based on Kubuntu that has a Hannah Montana theme.

50:12.840 --> 50:18.840
That's basically it but it is such a big meme that it is often mentioned in the Linux community.

50:18.840 --> 50:22.840
NSA's attempts to backdoor Linux.

50:22.840 --> 50:27.840
It is a well-known fact that we are being spied on with our own tech.

50:27.840 --> 50:32.840
Windows is closed source and we all know that it spies its users.

50:32.840 --> 50:37.840
Android is open source, yes, but the Google Play services aren't

50:37.840 --> 50:41.840
and most Android phones need them to function properly.

50:41.840 --> 50:45.840
So it wouldn't be a big surprise that they were tracking us with them.

50:45.840 --> 50:52.840
Same goes for Apple that even when it says that they don't track us, we can't really be sure

50:52.840 --> 50:56.840
because iOS and Mac OS are closed source.

50:56.840 --> 51:03.840
This is when you start to wonder if Linux has some sort of backdoor for any government agency like the NSA.

51:03.840 --> 51:08.840
Well, it doesn't because if it did we would have already found out.

51:08.840 --> 51:13.840
But that doesn't mean that the NSA has in fact tried to backdoor the kernel.

51:13.840 --> 51:21.840
In this interview Linus Torbot is asked if the NSA has approached to him and asked him to backdoor the kernel.

51:21.840 --> 51:24.840
Just see how he replies.

51:24.840 --> 51:29.840
So this question, have any of you been approached by the US for a backdoor?

51:32.840 --> 51:33.840
No.

51:37.840 --> 51:42.840
Some say it was a joke, but others think it was real.

51:42.840 --> 51:49.840
Linus' father, Nels Torbot, once asked the same thing and he replied with the following.

51:49.840 --> 51:54.840
He almost posed the question when my oldest son was asked the same question.

51:54.840 --> 52:02.840
Do, are there, has he been approached by NSA about backdoors?

52:02.840 --> 52:10.840
Then he said no, but at the same time he nodded because then he was sort of in the legal free.

52:10.840 --> 52:16.840
He had given the right answer and everybody understood that NSA had approached them.

52:17.840 --> 52:20.840
Razor Fs

52:20.840 --> 52:31.840
It is a journaling file system license under the UPLP2 license that was introduced to Linux in the version 2.4.1.

52:31.840 --> 52:38.840
One of the features it offered was tail packing, a scheme to reduce internal fragmentation.

52:38.840 --> 52:41.840
Why is this almost at the end of the iceberg?

52:41.840 --> 52:51.840
Because of its creator, Hans Razor, his wife obtained a temporary restraining order against Hans in December 2004.

52:51.840 --> 53:00.840
After he pushed her at the height of the divorce proceedings, she went missing on September 5th, 2006

53:00.840 --> 53:08.840
and later in October 10th, 2006, Hans was arrested for ending with the life of his wife.

53:08.840 --> 53:11.840
Debian Founders End

53:11.840 --> 53:19.840
Ian Ashley Murdock was an American software engineer born in April 28th, 1973.

53:19.840 --> 53:26.840
He is well known in the open source community for being the founder of the Linux distribution, Debian.

53:26.840 --> 53:35.840
On December 28th of 2015, he started to post some very weird tweets where he said that he was going to commit.

53:35.840 --> 53:40.840
But then he stated that he was being harassed by some police officers.

53:40.840 --> 53:50.840
Later that day, he committed suicide due to asphyxiation caused by himself with a vacuum cleaner electrical cord.

53:50.840 --> 53:53.840
But that is what the police believes that happened.

53:53.840 --> 53:59.840
To this day, this is some very weird and shocking news for the Linux community.

53:59.840 --> 54:02.840
Well, this was all for today.

54:02.840 --> 54:08.840
If you made it this far, I really don't know how to thank you. You are helping my channel a lot.

54:08.840 --> 54:12.840
This video took me a long time to make, but I enjoyed it.

54:12.840 --> 54:18.840
If you'd just like me to make any other tech-related iceberg videos, let me know in the comment section.

54:18.840 --> 54:24.840
I've been thinking about making the Android iceberg or the Google iceberg in general.

54:24.840 --> 54:28.840
Some other option is the Apple or iPhone iceberg.

54:28.840 --> 54:31.840
Goodbye world, see you in the next one.

54:32.840 --> 54:34.840
Thanks for watching.
