1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:14,080
I was 13 when I first got access to a computer.

2
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:18,280
My parents bought me a Macintosh in 1984 when I was 8 years old.

3
00:00:18,280 --> 00:00:19,560
I was in sixth grade.

4
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:21,400
I learned to code in college.

5
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:25,680
Freshman year, first semester, intro to computer science.

6
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:28,600
I wrote a program to play Tic-Tac-Toe.

7
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:29,840
I think it was pretty humble beginnings.

8
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:32,960
I think the first program I wrote asked things like,

9
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:34,440
what's your favorite color?

10
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:35,560
Or how old are you?

11
00:00:35,560 --> 00:00:37,920
I first learned how to make a green circle

12
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:40,680
and a red square appear on the screen.

13
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:42,600
The first time I actually had something come up

14
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:44,840
and say, hello world.

15
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:46,240
I made a computer do that.

16
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:47,480
It was just astonishing.

17
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:48,840
Learning how to program didn't start off

18
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:52,040
as wanting to learn all of computer science

19
00:00:52,040 --> 00:00:55,240
or trying to master this discipline or anything like that.

20
00:00:55,240 --> 00:00:56,680
It just started off because I wanted

21
00:00:56,680 --> 00:00:58,400
to do this one simple thing.

22
00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:00,200
I wanted to make something that was fun for myself

23
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:01,240
and my sisters.

24
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:04,000
And I wrote this little program and then basically just

25
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
add a little bit to it.

26
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,680
And then when I needed to learn something new,

27
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:08,800
I looked it up, either in a book or on the internet,

28
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:10,200
and then added a little bit to it.

29
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:12,880
It's really not unlike kind of playing an instrument or something

30
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:14,840
or playing a sport.

31
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:18,760
It starts out being very intimidating,

32
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:21,200
but you kind of get the hang of it over time.

33
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:23,200
Coding is something that can be learned.

34
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:25,800
And I know it can be intimidating.

35
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:27,960
A lot of things are intimidating.

36
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:30,520
But what isn't?

37
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:33,920
A lot of the coding that people do is actually fairly simple.

38
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:36,920
It's more about the process of breaking down problems

39
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:40,440
than sort of coming up with complicated algorithms

40
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:42,080
as people traditionally think about it.

41
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:47,240
You don't have to be a genius to know how to code.

42
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:48,600
You need to be determined.

43
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:52,400
Addition, subtraction, that's about it.

44
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:54,960
You should probably know your multiplication tables.

45
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:56,240
You don't have to be a genius to code.

46
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:57,880
Do you have to be a genius to read?

47
00:01:57,880 --> 00:02:02,040
Even if you want to become a race car driver or play baseball

48
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:06,120
or build a house, all of these things

49
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:07,880
have been turned upside down by software.

50
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:10,120
What it is is computers are everywhere.

51
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:11,720
You want to work in agriculture?

52
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:13,200
Do you want to work in entertainment?

53
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:15,600
Do you want to work in manufacturing?

54
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:16,960
It's just all over.

55
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:31,320
Here we are in 2013.

56
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:35,920
We all depend on technology to communicate, to bank,

57
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:40,560
information, and none of us know how to read and write code.

58
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:47,320
When I was in school, I was in this after-school group

59
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:48,200
called the WizKids.

60
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:50,760
And when people found out, they laughed at me

61
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:52,160
and you know all these things.

62
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:53,360
And I'm like, man, I don't care.

63
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:54,400
I think it's cool.

64
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:56,080
And, you know, I'm learning a lot.

65
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:58,520
And some of my friends have jobs.

66
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:05,480
Our policy is literally to hire as many talented engineers

67
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:06,920
as we can find.

68
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:08,600
The whole limit in the system is just

69
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:11,280
that there just aren't enough people who are trained

70
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:13,400
and have these skills today.

71
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:16,200
To get the very best people we try to make the office

72
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:17,560
as awesome as possible.

73
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:30,640
You have a fantastic chef.

74
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:31,800
Free food.

75
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:33,720
Breakfast, lunch, and dinner.

76
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:35,240
Free laundry.

77
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:37,040
Snacks.

78
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:41,160
Even places to play in video games and scooters.

79
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:43,760
There's all these kind of interesting things around the

80
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:46,240
office and places where people can play or relax.

81
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:48,480
You have a fantastic chef.

82
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:49,480
Free food.

83
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:51,480
Breakfast, lunch, and dinner.

84
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:52,480
Free laundry.

85
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:54,480
Snacks.

86
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:58,120
Places where people can play or relax or go to think or play

87
00:03:58,120 --> 00:03:59,200
music or be creative.

88
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:04,640
Whether you're trying to make a lot of money or whether you

89
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:06,720
just want to change the world, computer programming is

90
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:08,880
an incredibly empowering skill to learn.

91
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:13,920
I think if someone had told me that software is really

92
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:17,440
about humanity, that it's really about helping people

93
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:20,360
by using computer technology, it would have changed

94
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:21,920
my outlook a lot earlier.

95
00:04:21,960 --> 00:04:26,600
To be able to actually come up with an idea and then see it

96
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:28,960
in your hands and then be able to press a button and have it

97
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:32,280
be in millions of people's hands, I think we're the first

98
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:33,680
generation in the world that's really ever had

99
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:34,960
that kind of experience.

100
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:38,840
Just to think that you can start something in your college

101
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:42,040
dorm room and you can have a set of people who haven't built

102
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:45,000
a big company before come together and built something

103
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,480
that a billion people use as part of their daily lives is

104
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:49,680
just crazy to think about.

105
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:51,880
It's humbling and it's amazing.

106
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:55,000
The programmers of tomorrow are the wizards of the future.

107
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,800
You know, you're going to look like you have magic powers

108
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:58,480
compared to everybody else.

109
00:04:58,480 --> 00:04:59,320
I think it's amazing.

110
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:02,480
I think it's the closest thing we have to a superpower.

111
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:04,480
Great coders are today's rock stars.

112
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:08,440
That's it.
