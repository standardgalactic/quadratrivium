0	14080	I was 13 when I first got access to a computer.
14080	18280	My parents bought me a Macintosh in 1984 when I was 8 years old.
18280	19560	I was in sixth grade.
19560	21400	I learned to code in college.
21400	25680	Freshman year, first semester, intro to computer science.
25680	28600	I wrote a program to play Tic-Tac-Toe.
28600	29840	I think it was pretty humble beginnings.
29840	32960	I think the first program I wrote asked things like,
32960	34440	what's your favorite color?
34440	35560	Or how old are you?
35560	37920	I first learned how to make a green circle
37920	40680	and a red square appear on the screen.
40680	42600	The first time I actually had something come up
42600	44840	and say, hello world.
44840	46240	I made a computer do that.
46240	47480	It was just astonishing.
47480	48840	Learning how to program didn't start off
48840	52040	as wanting to learn all of computer science
52040	55240	or trying to master this discipline or anything like that.
55240	56680	It just started off because I wanted
56680	58400	to do this one simple thing.
58400	60200	I wanted to make something that was fun for myself
60200	61240	and my sisters.
61240	64000	And I wrote this little program and then basically just
64000	65000	add a little bit to it.
65000	66680	And then when I needed to learn something new,
66680	68800	I looked it up, either in a book or on the internet,
68800	70200	and then added a little bit to it.
70200	72880	It's really not unlike kind of playing an instrument or something
72880	74840	or playing a sport.
77280	78760	It starts out being very intimidating,
78760	81200	but you kind of get the hang of it over time.
81200	83200	Coding is something that can be learned.
83200	85800	And I know it can be intimidating.
85800	87960	A lot of things are intimidating.
87960	90520	But what isn't?
90520	93920	A lot of the coding that people do is actually fairly simple.
93920	96920	It's more about the process of breaking down problems
96920	100440	than sort of coming up with complicated algorithms
100440	102080	as people traditionally think about it.
105080	107240	You don't have to be a genius to know how to code.
107240	108600	You need to be determined.
108600	112400	Addition, subtraction, that's about it.
112400	114960	You should probably know your multiplication tables.
114960	116240	You don't have to be a genius to code.
116240	117880	Do you have to be a genius to read?
117880	122040	Even if you want to become a race car driver or play baseball
122040	126120	or build a house, all of these things
126120	127880	have been turned upside down by software.
127880	130120	What it is is computers are everywhere.
130120	131720	You want to work in agriculture?
131720	133200	Do you want to work in entertainment?
133200	135600	Do you want to work in manufacturing?
135600	136960	It's just all over.
148840	151320	Here we are in 2013.
151320	155920	We all depend on technology to communicate, to bank,
155920	160560	information, and none of us know how to read and write code.
164960	167320	When I was in school, I was in this after-school group
167320	168200	called the WizKids.
168200	170760	And when people found out, they laughed at me
170760	172160	and you know all these things.
172160	173360	And I'm like, man, I don't care.
173360	174400	I think it's cool.
174400	176080	And, you know, I'm learning a lot.
176440	178520	And some of my friends have jobs.
181880	185480	Our policy is literally to hire as many talented engineers
185480	186920	as we can find.
186920	188600	The whole limit in the system is just
188600	191280	that there just aren't enough people who are trained
191280	193400	and have these skills today.
193400	196200	To get the very best people we try to make the office
196200	197560	as awesome as possible.
206080	210640	You have a fantastic chef.
210640	211800	Free food.
211800	213720	Breakfast, lunch, and dinner.
213720	215240	Free laundry.
215240	217040	Snacks.
217040	221160	Even places to play in video games and scooters.
221160	223760	There's all these kind of interesting things around the
223760	226240	office and places where people can play or relax.
226240	228480	You have a fantastic chef.
228480	229480	Free food.
229480	231480	Breakfast, lunch, and dinner.
231480	232480	Free laundry.
232480	234480	Snacks.
234480	238120	Places where people can play or relax or go to think or play
238120	239200	music or be creative.
242760	244640	Whether you're trying to make a lot of money or whether you
244640	246720	just want to change the world, computer programming is
246720	248880	an incredibly empowering skill to learn.
248880	253920	I think if someone had told me that software is really
253920	257440	about humanity, that it's really about helping people
257440	260360	by using computer technology, it would have changed
260360	261920	my outlook a lot earlier.
261960	266600	To be able to actually come up with an idea and then see it
266600	268960	in your hands and then be able to press a button and have it
268960	272280	be in millions of people's hands, I think we're the first
272280	273680	generation in the world that's really ever had
273680	274960	that kind of experience.
274960	278840	Just to think that you can start something in your college
278840	282040	dorm room and you can have a set of people who haven't built
282040	285000	a big company before come together and built something
285000	288480	that a billion people use as part of their daily lives is
288480	289680	just crazy to think about.
289680	291880	It's humbling and it's amazing.
291880	295000	The programmers of tomorrow are the wizards of the future.
295000	296800	You know, you're going to look like you have magic powers
296800	298480	compared to everybody else.
298480	299320	I think it's amazing.
299320	302480	I think it's the closest thing we have to a superpower.
302480	304480	Great coders are today's rock stars.
307120	308440	That's it.
