00:00.000 --> 00:14.080
I was 13 when I first got access to a computer.

00:14.080 --> 00:18.280
My parents bought me a Macintosh in 1984 when I was 8 years old.

00:18.280 --> 00:19.560
I was in sixth grade.

00:19.560 --> 00:21.400
I learned to code in college.

00:21.400 --> 00:25.680
Freshman year, first semester, intro to computer science.

00:25.680 --> 00:28.600
I wrote a program to play Tic-Tac-Toe.

00:28.600 --> 00:29.840
I think it was pretty humble beginnings.

00:29.840 --> 00:32.960
I think the first program I wrote asked things like,

00:32.960 --> 00:34.440
what's your favorite color?

00:34.440 --> 00:35.560
Or how old are you?

00:35.560 --> 00:37.920
I first learned how to make a green circle

00:37.920 --> 00:40.680
and a red square appear on the screen.

00:40.680 --> 00:42.600
The first time I actually had something come up

00:42.600 --> 00:44.840
and say, hello world.

00:44.840 --> 00:46.240
I made a computer do that.

00:46.240 --> 00:47.480
It was just astonishing.

00:47.480 --> 00:48.840
Learning how to program didn't start off

00:48.840 --> 00:52.040
as wanting to learn all of computer science

00:52.040 --> 00:55.240
or trying to master this discipline or anything like that.

00:55.240 --> 00:56.680
It just started off because I wanted

00:56.680 --> 00:58.400
to do this one simple thing.

00:58.400 --> 01:00.200
I wanted to make something that was fun for myself

01:00.200 --> 01:01.240
and my sisters.

01:01.240 --> 01:04.000
And I wrote this little program and then basically just

01:04.000 --> 01:05.000
add a little bit to it.

01:05.000 --> 01:06.680
And then when I needed to learn something new,

01:06.680 --> 01:08.800
I looked it up, either in a book or on the internet,

01:08.800 --> 01:10.200
and then added a little bit to it.

01:10.200 --> 01:12.880
It's really not unlike kind of playing an instrument or something

01:12.880 --> 01:14.840
or playing a sport.

01:17.280 --> 01:18.760
It starts out being very intimidating,

01:18.760 --> 01:21.200
but you kind of get the hang of it over time.

01:21.200 --> 01:23.200
Coding is something that can be learned.

01:23.200 --> 01:25.800
And I know it can be intimidating.

01:25.800 --> 01:27.960
A lot of things are intimidating.

01:27.960 --> 01:30.520
But what isn't?

01:30.520 --> 01:33.920
A lot of the coding that people do is actually fairly simple.

01:33.920 --> 01:36.920
It's more about the process of breaking down problems

01:36.920 --> 01:40.440
than sort of coming up with complicated algorithms

01:40.440 --> 01:42.080
as people traditionally think about it.

01:45.080 --> 01:47.240
You don't have to be a genius to know how to code.

01:47.240 --> 01:48.600
You need to be determined.

01:48.600 --> 01:52.400
Addition, subtraction, that's about it.

01:52.400 --> 01:54.960
You should probably know your multiplication tables.

01:54.960 --> 01:56.240
You don't have to be a genius to code.

01:56.240 --> 01:57.880
Do you have to be a genius to read?

01:57.880 --> 02:02.040
Even if you want to become a race car driver or play baseball

02:02.040 --> 02:06.120
or build a house, all of these things

02:06.120 --> 02:07.880
have been turned upside down by software.

02:07.880 --> 02:10.120
What it is is computers are everywhere.

02:10.120 --> 02:11.720
You want to work in agriculture?

02:11.720 --> 02:13.200
Do you want to work in entertainment?

02:13.200 --> 02:15.600
Do you want to work in manufacturing?

02:15.600 --> 02:16.960
It's just all over.

02:28.840 --> 02:31.320
Here we are in 2013.

02:31.320 --> 02:35.920
We all depend on technology to communicate, to bank,

02:35.920 --> 02:40.560
information, and none of us know how to read and write code.

02:44.960 --> 02:47.320
When I was in school, I was in this after-school group

02:47.320 --> 02:48.200
called the WizKids.

02:48.200 --> 02:50.760
And when people found out, they laughed at me

02:50.760 --> 02:52.160
and you know all these things.

02:52.160 --> 02:53.360
And I'm like, man, I don't care.

02:53.360 --> 02:54.400
I think it's cool.

02:54.400 --> 02:56.080
And, you know, I'm learning a lot.

02:56.440 --> 02:58.520
And some of my friends have jobs.

03:01.880 --> 03:05.480
Our policy is literally to hire as many talented engineers

03:05.480 --> 03:06.920
as we can find.

03:06.920 --> 03:08.600
The whole limit in the system is just

03:08.600 --> 03:11.280
that there just aren't enough people who are trained

03:11.280 --> 03:13.400
and have these skills today.

03:13.400 --> 03:16.200
To get the very best people we try to make the office

03:16.200 --> 03:17.560
as awesome as possible.

03:26.080 --> 03:30.640
You have a fantastic chef.

03:30.640 --> 03:31.800
Free food.

03:31.800 --> 03:33.720
Breakfast, lunch, and dinner.

03:33.720 --> 03:35.240
Free laundry.

03:35.240 --> 03:37.040
Snacks.

03:37.040 --> 03:41.160
Even places to play in video games and scooters.

03:41.160 --> 03:43.760
There's all these kind of interesting things around the

03:43.760 --> 03:46.240
office and places where people can play or relax.

03:46.240 --> 03:48.480
You have a fantastic chef.

03:48.480 --> 03:49.480
Free food.

03:49.480 --> 03:51.480
Breakfast, lunch, and dinner.

03:51.480 --> 03:52.480
Free laundry.

03:52.480 --> 03:54.480
Snacks.

03:54.480 --> 03:58.120
Places where people can play or relax or go to think or play

03:58.120 --> 03:59.200
music or be creative.

04:02.760 --> 04:04.640
Whether you're trying to make a lot of money or whether you

04:04.640 --> 04:06.720
just want to change the world, computer programming is

04:06.720 --> 04:08.880
an incredibly empowering skill to learn.

04:08.880 --> 04:13.920
I think if someone had told me that software is really

04:13.920 --> 04:17.440
about humanity, that it's really about helping people

04:17.440 --> 04:20.360
by using computer technology, it would have changed

04:20.360 --> 04:21.920
my outlook a lot earlier.

04:21.960 --> 04:26.600
To be able to actually come up with an idea and then see it

04:26.600 --> 04:28.960
in your hands and then be able to press a button and have it

04:28.960 --> 04:32.280
be in millions of people's hands, I think we're the first

04:32.280 --> 04:33.680
generation in the world that's really ever had

04:33.680 --> 04:34.960
that kind of experience.

04:34.960 --> 04:38.840
Just to think that you can start something in your college

04:38.840 --> 04:42.040
dorm room and you can have a set of people who haven't built

04:42.040 --> 04:45.000
a big company before come together and built something

04:45.000 --> 04:48.480
that a billion people use as part of their daily lives is

04:48.480 --> 04:49.680
just crazy to think about.

04:49.680 --> 04:51.880
It's humbling and it's amazing.

04:51.880 --> 04:55.000
The programmers of tomorrow are the wizards of the future.

04:55.000 --> 04:56.800
You know, you're going to look like you have magic powers

04:56.800 --> 04:58.480
compared to everybody else.

04:58.480 --> 04:59.320
I think it's amazing.

04:59.320 --> 05:02.480
I think it's the closest thing we have to a superpower.

05:02.480 --> 05:04.480
Great coders are today's rock stars.

05:07.120 --> 05:08.440
That's it.
