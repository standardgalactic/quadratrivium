0	5280	Hey everybody, let's build a Dyson Sphere. We know we want to, humanity yearns for the
5280	10000	cosmic climb, so where do we start? Welcome to science technology in the future. Today
10000	15200	we have Canadian futurist, science writer and ethicist George Svorsky with us. He wrote
15200	20400	an interesting piece on how to build a Dyson Sphere in five easy steps. So we are here to
20400	26800	discuss the hows, what's, wins and where's of doing so. George Svorsky has appeared many
26800	31440	times in our show since 2012 discussing journalism, human enhancement, singularity,
31440	37440	the Turing test and the AlphaGo phenomenon. He is a contributing editor at Gizmodo and IO9,
37440	42240	the chairman of the board at the Institute for Ethics and Emerging Technologies and it's one
42240	47920	of the directors for the rights of non-human persons program. Hey thank you so much. It's sad
47920	53680	that we're here to discuss the passing of an iconic figure but it certainly gives us a good
53680	58480	opportunity to delve into some of the issues that he raised over the course of his illustrious
58480	64080	career and at times a controversial career and we'll dive in and explore some of these pretty
64080	70800	exciting concepts. So the way that I was really introduced to the idea of Freeman Dyson was
70800	76720	actually through Dyson Spheres, my interest in large galactic mega-scale structures. First of all,
76800	84960	I mean what is a Dyson sphere and why would we want to build one? Yeah I mean the whole,
84960	92080	I mean the whole thing got started for Dyson back in the late the late 50s. I think you penned
92080	97920	this two, just a two-page essay where you just kind of got thinking that you know eventually
98560	103680	you know like a super sophisticated, super powerful technological civilization
103680	110160	they're going to need a lot more energy than what's you know what could possibly be provided on
110160	116320	their home planet. So he conjectured about these hypothetical megastructures which are basically
116320	126640	these under a massive array of solar panels that will completely envelop the sun and extract
126640	135520	virtually all the energy that's output from the from the star. And yeah I think he had originally
135520	144000	envisioned it as a whole fleet of satellites like a spacecraft in orbit around the sun
145760	151680	but out of tremendous like like I would think like hundreds of kilometers of density so they
151680	154960	would not you know they would not intersect in this fashion to each other but effectively
154960	160880	it would kind of from a distant observer there'd be so many and so many working in concert that
160880	168320	would effectively like be this swarm of spacecraft or really what are solar panels in orbit like I
168320	173040	said around the sun extracting that energy and that energy could therefore be used to to power that
173040	180000	civilization and they could continue to advance and you know develop as an advanced civilization.
180800	186000	And he also got thinking well if this is a possibility for extraterrestrials well two
186000	190480	things come from that one he said well it therefore represents a way for us to potentially detect
190480	195040	the signs of extraterrestrial civilization so that thus becomes a kind of techno signature
195680	201840	and indeed this this obviously this this giant shield that kind of you know envelops the sun
201840	207200	is going to be absorbing a tremendous amount of heat it will then be giving off a certain amount
207200	212160	of heat radiation so he said that and others have since speculated that we should be able to
212160	217120	detect this infrared signature at specific bands from Earth but that'll that'll depend on the
217120	223680	materials that are used and the amount of heat that still is able to be dissipated from the structure
224480	231200	and yeah I mean and then the other the other the second issue that this raises is that well hey
231200	234560	that means that's something that we might do in the future as well so this is not something exclusive
234560	239040	for extraterrestrials it's something that future humans might want to build as well
239680	246320	and yeah I mean it's pretty exciting as an idea I think it's a no-brainer I'm not
246320	252000	that's funny because I'm such a huge advocate of solar power as a renewable like I yeah I like
252000	257920	wind of course and I make some renewables but oh my god like for me like a solar is a no-brainer
257920	262560	I have this envision like from transformers like Cybertron but instead of kind of creating
262560	267040	Cybertron why don't we just convert Earth into this gigantic solar you know like basically a
267040	272880	gigantic orb that's plastered in solar arrays right yeah I exaggerate but but the point is that we
272880	279200	are absolutely squandering so much real estate on this planet that should be extracting solar
280400	286640	you know solar energy that's otherwise going to waste of course you know we don't want to
286640	291200	destroy it for us and things like that obviously plant life and other life need this well there's
291200	297280	a lot of death it's isn't there yeah there's a lot of rooftops unit I mean those two things right
297280	302640	there I mean we could just exploit those resources in terms of real estate we go a long way I think
302640	308080	to providing some of the much needed power so but what Dyson was thinking about back in 1959
308640	313200	again he was thinking that eventually though you know this will be unsatisfactory even if we
313200	319040	can't harness as much as much energy as we can on the planet and what would be what would what
319040	323760	was since we would be referred to as like a Kardashian one civilization but perhaps I'm jumping
323760	326880	ahead of ourselves as we will get to Kardashian stuff in just a minute but it's nice that these
326880	332080	ideas intersect with each other that a Kardashian one scale civilization would harness the entire
332080	336880	energy available to it on this host planet where it would therefore need to graduate to a Kardashian
336880	340640	two scale civilization where it can actually harness all of the available output from its host
340640	346080	star and that's where Dyson Spirit provided the Dyson provided a mechanism a potential mega
346080	351680	structure with which this could conceivably actually happen so it's kind of obviously
351680	356560	futurists get excited by this idea because it really does present a plausible solution for our
357200	361840	energy needs moving forward whatever those energy for whatever we want to you know convert that
361840	368400	energy into in future whether we're running supercomputers or you know the like so so yeah
368400	371600	that's that's that's kind of maybe that's the answer your question yeah that's kind of like
371600	376080	what this what we haven't even got into all the different kinds of Dyson structures that
376080	381040	can exist but that basically is you know how I'd answer your question as to why and how
381040	389040	we're not how and why we want to build such a thing indeed yes um yeah so uh so two luminaries
389040	396080	two amazing minds recently passed away Freeman Dyson and Nikolai Kardashev no I'm not talking
396080	402720	about the Kardashians folks in case you haven't heard of like the Nikolai Kardashev here's a guy
402720	409120	who came up with civilizations the scales of civilization and and what sort of resources
409120	415440	they'd be using and how large they'd be and so yeah there's a there's three Kardashev scales do you
415440	421360	want to give us a brief yeah yeah sure and again very much a contemporary not the Kardashev scale
421360	426400	yeah the Kardashian scale is coming completely different we'll save that for another podcast
427200	433760	yeah so Freeman Dyson and Nikolai Kardashev obviously contemporaries so whereas Freeman Dyson
433760	440960	was running with Dyson Spears in 1959 I believe it was Kardashev in 1966 conceived of the Kardashev
440960	450640	scale and again it was a very simple scale uh one to three and you know he was to him like this
450720	457920	this way he was a soviet astrophysicist and to him you know energy availability was a
457920	463440	massive metric like it meant everything in terms of how you would you know really define a stage of
463440	470480	civilization and he got this idea well eventually you know a civilization should be able to harness
470480	475840	all the you know all the energy that it can possibly extract just on its home planet and that can be
475840	479760	you know obviously just we're just talking about solar so that can be incoming solar but can be
479760	483840	anything else it can be wind it can be currents and all that but eventually that's there's only so
483840	490320	much you can extract once you've kind of hit that cap you're what he would call a Kardashev one scale
490320	496640	civilization and the next was a civilization that can then harness the entire energy output of its
496640	503520	sun that's a Kardashev two scale and perhaps more radically I don't want to say more speculative
503600	509600	because all of this is speculative but more radically he also conjectured about a type three
510320	515200	Kardashev scale civilization which can harness the entire energy output of the host galaxy
515200	520720	which when you think about how many millions billions of stars are in the Milky Way that's a
520720	525840	lot of energy that's a you know mix of wonder you know at that point you know that that that
525840	529920	point is beyond human comprehension to understand what that civilization would be like and what
529920	534000	they could possibly use that much energy for it gets in it is kind of maybe like godlike
535040	541680	the state of being that again it's difficult to to imagine so oh man I looked at some of these
541680	547680	numbers and look it's hard to make intuitive sense oh I know they're just so ridiculously yeah the
547680	553280	exponentials are massive and yeah like the orders of magnitude beyond orders of magnitude beyond
553280	557280	orders of magnitude it's because the point where it doesn't the numbers that you suggest that
557360	563360	of them they just don't mean and it just doesn't make any more sense to us I think even like to
563360	568800	think about a Kardashev one scale civilization is still enough to kind of make my to make me real
568800	573200	in terms of what that would actually represent let alone you know a Dyson sphere capable civilization
574000	578880	and I mean since I mean that's a great scale and it got a lot of conversation going on the
578880	583040	late great Carl Sagan uh loved the idea and he thought hey why don't we actually kind of dive
583040	587840	into this a little bit break it down a little bit kind of came up with a schema for you know
587840	593280	creating incremental versions of Kardashev scale so according to his measure so for example today
593280	600800	earth and earth today human civilization would be about a 0.7 like a 0.75 on the scale so we're
600800	605680	gonna like we're like three quarters of the way there to be a full k1 civilization and similarly
605680	611120	they get out like 1.2 1.5 or whatever you know obviously if you're working from a Kardashev
611120	617520	two to three you could be a Kardashev you know 2.0000006 you probably that's a ridiculous you
617520	623440	know because you may be at that point in part is let's say 10% of the uh the Milky Way so these
623440	629040	kind of make sense and but even others are taking inspiration from uh Kardashev and come up with
629040	635280	other ideas you know for example the amount of space let's say that a civilization has uh as occupied
635280	640240	so let's say if it's now kind of dominates its entire solar its entire star system well that's
640240	644400	could be a certain level or the amount of infer this is not one that I'm particularly partial to
645280	653840	and I believe Carl Sagan also promoted this idea was that it was the amount of information available
653840	660880	to a civilization and I believe you kind of did this across the scale of A to Z so you could have
660880	666960	whereas A is like hardly any you know level of information and set as like I forget the way
666960	672240	what it was the the actual metric that he used but it was that that was like the end of the scale
672240	676160	so I believe he said that we were like at an H level so we were like we're like a Kardashev
676160	682640	so we were like we're like at a 0.75 H type civilization right now in terms of like not the
682640	686800	energy that we have available to ourselves and the amount of information processing that we're
686800	692000	capable of uh of engaging in and I think that those two things there are I think a very potent
692000	696000	measures you know where you're at there's of course it doesn't measure things like you know
696000	700080	gross domestic product that doesn't measure things like you know social well-being and
700080	704880	health factors um and I mean there's so many different ways I think you could still drill
704880	711600	down and come up with different ways of describing like the technological or social or political or
711600	718640	whatever aspect is important too in terms of the development of a civilization whether it be
718640	722320	ourselves whether it be an extraterrestrial level civilization and I think we'll always be biased
722320	728160	but what we think is a good metric of progress um you know so you know who knows maybe in a
728160	733520	hundred years from now we'll have a completely different sense as to what the direction and
733520	738960	the developmental trajectory that we would be desirable for uh an advancing uh civilization
738960	743360	such as our own and you know you can't speak to what that what that might actually be and maybe
743360	749920	if you look at for example maybe it could be the amount of um you know renewable uh energy
749920	755200	available to a civilization outside of uh non-renewables that'd be a good one I'd be
755200	761040	fascinated to see that you know that scale put you know put aside to that or if you were partial
761040	766800	to things like you know the hedonistic imperative uh or you know shadow engineering you know maybe
767680	773200	how far are we to toward that goal like and how many and how many individuals both human
773200	780160	and non-human animal on the planet are in a kind of uh entering into a state of uh of
780160	786160	hedonism as opposed to the kind of uh modality that we find ourselves in uh today so different
786160	790080	there's different ways on all this then you know that's Kardashian but that kind of got us thinking
790080	796400	about you know um the ways in which we can um you know conceive about uh you know how we describe
796400	803040	the state of a civilization yeah indeed yeah I should uh preface that I am partial to the hedonistic
803040	808480	imperative I've done a lot of interviews with David um although I don't think to me I just
808480	814160	I'm not quite ready to commit to pleasure being the only metric that's important I think uh
814160	821360	sensitivity to novelty is also very important and uh yeah um and the ability to to make progress
822160	831040	intelligence and um yeah so yeah wow it's it's it's amazing how large theoretically civilizations
831040	837600	could get um but it's been conjectured and I'm also a little bit worried that we can't see any
837600	843760	evidence of other civilizations doing this yeah and hence this this ties into the Fermi Paradox
843760	850160	right no Drake equation absolutely I mean first and foremost um we can almost write off Kardashian
850160	856480	three as a possibility because you know our our astronomical observations uh seem to be in violation
856480	863440	of that that idea you know we look up into the sky and uh we see no evidence of uh of you know
864160	870400	galaxies that have been completely uh re-engineered or in or away somehow obscured
870960	877840	um by um you know this massive use of uh of like Dysonian type megastructures and there have been
877840	882800	actually this is actually not something I just you know I'm not just idly saying this to you
882800	890560	there have actually been specific um astronomical observations looking for um these sorts of signatures
890560	896880	coming from other galaxies and obviously these studies aren't to be all an end all you know maybe
896880	902720	other ways of searching for these cloaked galaxies that are out there but we have yet to kind of see
902720	907680	such a thing so right off the bat it's like oh I don't know I mean I also think just I mean
908960	912720	it's kind of like you suggested it does bring the Fermi Paradox to mind because maybe we should
912720	917280	be seeing these like even if we are looking potentially you know hundreds of millions
917280	922160	or billions of light years away because obviously we're looking deep deep deep back into time
922720	927040	you know like we have for example special lens that could show us the universe or the cosmos
927040	932880	outside of the Hubble bubble that we're in maybe it would be a dark universe and maybe
932880	939040	that we're at a special a special time in our universe's development where galaxies are you know
940400	947120	starting to become subsumed by the intelligences which they've given birth to but more locally
947120	953040	to the Milky Way again the searches have only begun like we've only been talking about Dysonian
953040	959120	SETI for I'd say but the last 10 or 15 years and again the term Dysonian SETI again we can
959120	963360	that's a tip of the hat to Freeman Dyson so again thank you for for that and
965280	972080	with that the idea behind Dysonian SETI is in addition to looking for traces of Dyson spheres
972080	978640	or shovels or swarms or whatever we should be looking for any kind of techno artifact and in
978640	985600	particular mega-scale engineering because there could be many different kinds of things that advanced
986160	989760	extraterrestrial civilizations would do that would leave some kind of a signature for us to
989760	996400	be able to detect it could be everything from pollution and heat waste you know and back to
996400	1001440	pollution like for example even planets that are of an unnaturally high level of carbon dioxide or
1001440	1005600	have been other kind of chemical compounds that are not consistent with what we know about the
1005600	1009920	known laws of physics in terms of what can autonomously be generated through natural processes
1010960	1017360	it could be traces of s you know engines or the rearranging of stars or again or even just very
1017360	1024240	straightforwardly a you know a Dyson shell itself as we were alluding to earlier and even
1024240	1028560	what's also fascinating is that there's constantly you know new thinking in terms of where we should
1028560	1034960	be looking so recent papers said hey you know what like never mind like plain old stars like
1034960	1039920	we should be looking at pulsars for Dyson instructors that what they will do is that
1039920	1046080	that makes more sense to create what's like a Dyson like a Dyson ring is really what it would be
1046080	1050480	so just you can imagine a ring around a pulsar and I'm sure your viewers and listeners can imagine
1050480	1057360	that as the pulsars spewing those concentrated streams of energy it would be they would be
1057360	1062240	orientated along the ring the interior of the ring and it would be such power you know that
1063040	1068000	in such efficiency that you don't need you don't need to build such a massive structure
1069600	1073920	you know right now like for example we wanted to build a Dyson shell that completely enveloped
1073920	1078640	our sun here in our own solar system I think Andrew Sandberg is probably the leading guy that's
1078640	1084480	done this math among others and it's like yeah like you got to take apart Mercury probably
1084480	1088800	take a huge chunk out of Venus and let's go dive into the cores of the gas giants and next
1088800	1093680	you know like we're kind of starting to run out of actual material in the in our own solar system
1093680	1099200	to build such a thing so there is kind of like a prohibitive nature to to that as well so if you
1099200	1103840	if you can be more economical in terms of the material that you need to to build then why not
1103840	1109600	you know exploit perhaps better sources of that energy such as pulsars and there's even talk of
1109600	1115760	like for example creating similar structures around a black hole so what you do is let's say you know
1115760	1122560	black holes what they do is when they're uh when they're pulling in material they also spew a stream
1122560	1132240	of high energetic jet of photons so what you can do is I'll likewise set up a massive you know a raise
1132240	1136800	energy extracting a raise at the at the exit point there where the jet is streaming out
1136800	1141520	and you know that's your turbo your energy turbine for lack of a better word that that works there
1141600	1146400	or we can like deliberately shove a star or several several stars into a black hole to
1146400	1153280	even create facilitate this process and create even more output for us so um maybe it's not so
1153280	1158800	much a passive thing in terms of just some and capturing our star as it is going out there and
1158800	1164160	finding better places to exploit but now at this point really what we're talking about is we're now
1164160	1168720	escalating down that Kardashian scale we're now definitely I would say you gotta start at a k
1169040	1177040	two and then you know I don't think you go from k one to having you know a pulsar capable
1177040	1181120	Dyson shell I think you gotta you graduate towards you know to those you know means of
1181120	1189840	k ability and as you're working your way toward that k uh that uh I guess toward that k three status
1189840	1196320	so um so yeah um I forgot even what the initial question was Adam you have to remind me what
1197200	1203200	well you know what um I'm I'm just wondering like I guess we spoke about like a um what it means to
1204080	1209920	to not see any evidence of galactic structures or expansion of civilizations out there and we
1209920	1214720	we started to speak about the Fermi paradox and and Drake equation I brought up and
1214720	1221600	Robin Hansen brought up the great filter argument and he described the that we should be concerned
1221600	1227520	if there aren't any galactic spanning civilizations out there because it decreases the likelihood
1227520	1232400	that we will be able to reach that sort of status ourselves that will likely go extinct
1234320	1240720	yeah uh it's a very potent uh an upsetting idea and uh yeah I mean the the search for
1241280	1248160	Dyson instructors has only really just begun um so that was just to be fair but there have been
1248800	1255600	searches and nothing has come up yet but more more practically I suppose uh considering the
1255600	1261360	contributions of Enrico Fermi um it shouldn't even matter uh whether or not we see these spheres
1261360	1269840	or not what matters is that we we just seem to be uh completely um out of touch with other
1269840	1274960	extraterrestrial civilizations we see no no signs of anything they never they don't appear to travel
1274960	1281600	through the solar system um and what that means is is that and that for the casual listener that
1281600	1285280	might be the world I you know maybe you know maybe there've been tons of you know aliens that
1285280	1290240	sit through our solar system and and certainly while there's a I suppose a chance of that
1291360	1295280	there is a general feeling in the futurist community and those who are engaged in this
1295280	1301360	kind of deep deep kind of speculation that look when a and when when we're when we're talking
1301360	1304480	about these advanced civilizations they're not just going out on field trips you know
1304480	1308960	at holidays to visit star systems what we're talking about are is are expanding bubbles of
1308960	1315680	the civilization itself and that when it reaches another star system uh it doesn't just you know
1315680	1321680	pass through it actually will make it its own it'll actually adopt it build its own probably
1321680	1327120	you know extract all the resources it possibly can to continue to fuel its civilizations uh spread
1327200	1334000	including building a distance here around uh the star of that system completely transforming it
1334000	1339520	even more speculative everything and everything we're saying is so super specular but why not
1339520	1344240	let's just keep going if then you get some objectives like oh Star Trek Prime Directive
1344240	1348960	they come here and they'd be like oh there's intelligent civilization on earth we have to
1348960	1354640	leave them alone because it's Prime Directive like no no no no no like that what the the
1354640	1359120	very least what they would do is uh well destroy us but i doubt that that's the case i think more
1359120	1365440	plausibly than uplift us so within a snap of the finger they would basically uh integrate us within
1365440	1370960	their own civilization by whatever means is available to them so that's become part of the
1370960	1375440	organism become part of the board collective we'd be subsumed into their civilization hopefully it
1375440	1381520	would be a benign and uh enlightened uplift and not a like the board is obviously as a dystopian
1381520	1387120	scenario as it gets uh you would hope that that's not the kind of uh assimilation that would
1387120	1392080	happen and instead what i mean uplift i mean in the truest kind of like you know sense where we
1392080	1399360	would be uh you know bioengineer uh reconfigurated to be this kind of post biological uh entity that
1399360	1404800	they themselves are most assuredly uh that they most assuredly have become i'm not imagining
1404800	1412000	green aliens visiting us i'm imagining you know um uh machine minds digital beings passing through
1412000	1420000	here uh transforming you know the galaxy uh as they expand out through the milky way so yes so i
1420000	1424640	just stand step back a bit so yes it does not appear that we have been visited by extraterrestrial
1424640	1429680	civilizations why because everything looks pretty peaceful natural uh you know in a as that currently
1429680	1433840	you know that we've nothing but we're not touched we're not touched solar system so
1435360	1440640	um and as far as we can tell you know as we look out into the galaxy it looks like all of the other
1440640	1445600	star systems in our galaxy are the same of the same way although it's we still we have yet to see
1445600	1451920	any sign of something that's you know undeniably uh inalienably uh artificial in nature everything
1451920	1457840	this does appear to be out there we look out in space it's very these are all natural processes
1457840	1463040	everything fits in nice and cosily you know within the laws of physics as we know it so there's no
1463040	1471840	reason for us to believe that that we're looking into uh you know a highly technified uh galaxy so
1472480	1477440	that's that's kind of essentially i mean that's probably taking what Fermi said a little too far
1477440	1482400	all his observation was like oh my god like we you know we we should have definitely seen somebody
1482400	1490400	by now like uh what he what's what's what's potent about the Fermi paradox is he basically
1490400	1494800	eliminated time as a factor because that what would you a common argument is like oh there
1494800	1502400	hasn't been enough time uh for civilizations to occupy the entire galaxy um and that's fundamentally
1502400	1509520	wrong uh there has been more than enough time our galaxy is really really old and has been able to
1509520	1516080	host a biological life for a very long time uh long enough such that uh you know this galaxy
1516080	1521920	should have been colonized you know not just once but multiple times yet it's not it hasn't happened
1522480	1527200	and that's kind of alarming and that's what you know Robin Hansen has said well maybe it's because
1528160	1533440	it doesn't happen that there is this kind of great filter in effect where that you know no civilization
1533440	1544160	can and there's a certain developmental stage that nobody can get past and it could it might be
1544160	1550320	self-destruction of some sort it i mean it could be let's say a technological a complete you know
1550320	1556880	technological hurdle um even if you even go for example it could even go back in time to the uh the
1556880	1563600	the the rise of uh you know uh from you know single sub-life to multi-cellular life and that
1563600	1567360	that's the case that's actually amazing new that's the best news i could possibly share with anybody
1567360	1571200	today because it means we've actually passed the great filter and that we're freaks we shouldn't
1571200	1576480	actually even be here and we might even be the only civilization in the entire universe for
1576480	1580880	certainly in the galaxy that somehow we leaked through this filter where you know no other
1580880	1584560	planet that was even possible so that that's we don't in other words we don't know if the filters
1584560	1590320	behind us or if it's still ahead of us personally i'm inclined to think that it's it's ahead of us
1590320	1595360	that we're heading toward our daily our inevitable doom and that there's something that will prevent
1595360	1601840	us from building dyson spheres and becoming a kardash of you know you know 2.4 civilizations
1601840	1606720	and so on which is a kind of depressing thought but unfortunately that's potentially where the
1606720	1612320	evidence is leading us in terms of trying to understand you know our future there were other
1612320	1618560	possibilities of course i mean this is quite alarming but it's also um a great motivation
1618560	1626080	to be extra careful and to do whatever we can to increase the likelihood of um becoming aware
1626080	1632640	of potential filter should be stepping right into one and mitigate the likelihood that that'll
1633440	1639200	wipe us out like all filters you know something gets through like a great filter is considered
1639200	1646400	like to be many like like robert hanson described it as a whole like range of things but um like
1646400	1653280	steps going up a staircase now some some life doesn't make it beyond the first step some life
1653280	1659200	makes it beyond the second and third and fourth maybe we're on the 16th and there's a 17 18 19
1659200	1665840	20th before we reach a technological mature civilization um so hopefully they don't like
1665920	1671520	squash us out of existence before we do that right yes it's an interesting thought and uh
1671520	1675680	i mean we there's no shortage of threats in our future i mean we could we could go on and on about
1675680	1679520	artificial superintelligence we could talk about molecular nanotechnology we can talk about you
1679520	1684480	know deliberately engineered viruses and on and on and on not to mention the nuclear threat which
1684480	1690720	remains an apocalyptic uh risk um so there's still that and like i said things that we could probably
1690720	1695200	invent that we don't even know are possible but there's also nothing to consider is that
1695200	1701120	maybe there are modalities of existence that advanced life you know um kind of escapes into
1701120	1706960	that doesn't involve you know uh you know this kind of you know colonization way that we've been
1706960	1713520	talking about um yet you know at the same time these these solutions have to do two things that
1713520	1719520	has to satisfy the energy requirements needed to enter into that desirable modality of existence
1719520	1723600	and it has to be a solution that applies to every other single uh advanced extraterrestrial
1723600	1728480	civilization out there not just the subset because when it didn't apply to every uh advanced sieve
1729360	1733920	then at least some would decide to embark upon colonization campaigns and again the solution
1734560	1738640	has to take that into consideration has to come up with a like i said like a solution that's like
1738640	1745760	well what what's to prevent everybody from venturing out and reworking the uh Milky Way
1745760	1750320	in their own image so that's that to consider well there's yeah exactly there's a prism
1750320	1757920	prisoner's dilemma right where um if you're ever aware that you have galactic neighbors
1757920	1764320	or that you are suspicious that one you have galactic neighbors you're going to try um and get
1764320	1770880	all the resources that you can to preemptively protect yourself or even use to attack this
1770880	1777280	potential neighbor so that they don't do exactly the same thing everybody like would be thinking
1777280	1784320	of the same thing um let's reduce let's let's grab the resources so that we can defend and attack
1785200	1790240	and perhaps even preemptively strike because our neighbors might be also thinking of
1790240	1795280	preemptively striking whether they're aggressive or not they may decide that that's just the most
1795280	1801840	rational self-interested thing to do yeah that's a very depressing thought i mean uh it's uh and
1801840	1805200	i love that you invoke the prisoner's dilemma there and it does seem that that's kind of the
1805200	1809600	situation like you know what do you do with partial information you know what do you do you
1809600	1815520	know when you're not entirely sure what um you know a cohort is what kind of decisions a cohort
1815520	1821040	is going to make and yeah just the whole maxian concept you therefore unleash a whole fleet of
1821040	1827840	berserker probes and sterilize the uh the Milky Way before you know a berserker uh you know swarm
1827840	1832880	you know uh wipes you up uh again that's another i find also find it fascinating maybe more
1832880	1838480	optimistically that we also have no evidence of berserker probes again a berserker probe is um
1839120	1844800	this idea that uh instead of like happy von Neumann probes that are self-replicating probes that go
1844800	1849440	out there and do exploratory work or even colonization work um and then again like I said they
1849440	1855120	self-replicate and they continue to spread and spread and spread in a very happy way um uh berserker
1855120	1861680	probes just simply go out and uh just destroy uh basically they're sterilization waves and
1861680	1866480	then it would be it would be well it could be one of several reasons as to why this can happen
1866480	1872800	well one is just pure like malevolence just to like create this kind of scorched earth policy or
1872800	1879360	scorched galaxy scorched galaxy he has scorched galaxy policy to bring just as a protective
1879360	1885280	measure so a defensive measure um it could be uh like a rogue ai has gone completely you know
1885280	1890480	mad and it's just you know uh you know or just as or just again I don't want to speculate on
1890480	1897360	the reasons but I mean it's it's the fact is that we've not actually seen such a way make our
1897360	1902320	and make us way through our galaxy uh simply because we're here uh we're talking about berserker
1902320	1904800	probes so if you're talking about berserker probes they're probably things that they don't
1904800	1910080	actually exist uh so that's how like I said it'd be more optimistic way of looking at it
1912080	1918400	yeah that's true um now you've done like you've recorded like a whole taxonomy of different
1918400	1925680	types of like possible von Neumann probes right um yeah and you you you're in discussions with
1925680	1932160	aliezer and what was it nick buster maybe and is sandberg um trying to sort of lay out at least
1932160	1937280	some of these different yeah one of the ones um this came out of a discussion at uh chicago in
1937280	1945280	two 2008 i think transvision and uh it's kind of like aliezer the greatest term for you call it
1945280	1950320	the whack-a-mole hypothesis which is this idea that you that yeah that you have kind of like
1950320	1954720	berserker probes do exist but they're they're they're they're they're they're discriminant as
1954720	1961840	opposed to indiscriminate so like similar to like uh the the monolith on the moon uh in 2001
1961840	1965840	it's just hanging out kind of waiting for us to reach a certain developmental stage
1965840	1970640	and then it's kind of like kicks into action and it does what it does uh again what what a
1970640	1976640	wonderful idea by Arthur C Clarke but anyways uh so the idea of the of the whack-a-mole uh
1976640	1983200	discriminant probe is that it's waiting simply to see what becomes of us uh after the as a result
1983200	1988560	of our own technological singularity that one of the big things that Yadkowski talks about is that
1988560	1993040	there isn't necessarily just one kind of artificial super intelligence that can emerge that there's a
1993040	1999920	whole family of different types that can come out of the technological singularity we just don't know
1999920	2004880	what kind we're going to produce and nor do the aliens know what kind we're going to produce
2004880	2010320	whether it's a happy version or a sad version so let's say it's hanging out there and we can't
2010320	2018400	detect it it it's it sees it oh we've passed the technological singularity and it's a oh it's a good
2018400	2022720	good ai we're going to let them live and we're going to just let them be or integrate us or whatever
2022720	2027680	or if it's a potentially dangerous artificial super intelligence when they even threatens
2027680	2035440	the aliens is uh ongoing survival then it will extinguish us and that's the end of that so that's
2035440	2041920	just that's one idea and um uh and even as another idea for these uh self-replicating or not even
2041920	2045920	self-replicating but just this idea of probe technology Andrew Sandberg has also speculated
2045920	2050400	about uh kind of like policing probes which is kind of like maybe a more enlightened idea what
2050400	2055120	you were suggesting earlier about uh you know going out just you know terminating uh potential
2055120	2061520	threats is just basically exactly that just kind of like policing and uh kind of just assessing and
2061520	2067040	just uh making sure that any any threats that or anything that's coming in is what was desirable
2067040	2071200	rather than uh than you know than potential threat so in other words we may not have to
2071200	2077120	be a prisoner's dilemma sort of situation we can maybe have this kind of intermediary situation
2077120	2080640	where we can kind of just get a sense as to the intentions of that extraterrestrial civilization
2080640	2086240	but um yeah there's uh there's different you know ways of thinking about this problem
2087280	2095120	oh absolutely and that's a whole whack-a-mole or whack-a-civilization idea brings up some absurd
2095120	2107440	visuals in my head yes um yeah so well I guess you've also been given us a very uh interesting
2108320	2115840	step-by-step description of how we could bootstrap a um a galactic civilization starting with a
2115840	2121920	Dyson sphere or a Dyson swarm usually people um mean Dyson swarms when they say Dyson spheres
2121920	2128400	and not a thing that sort of shell with gravity problems um yeah so do you want to just step us
2128400	2135600	through sure and to be clear and to be clear this idea is uh is not my own it's uh it was
2135600	2141120	Stuart Armstrong from Oxford University who first articulated this particular model for
2142000	2148880	or like you suggested bootstrapping the Dyson sphere and what I did was I kind of distilled
2148880	2155600	his ideas and popularized it and I've been happy to talk about talk about it ever since but definitely
2155600	2161280	he deserves full credit for this idea so what it is is what he was saying is that really that
2161280	2167440	within short order we will um be able to start working on this it is not something that we should
2167440	2173680	think of as you know being so far away in the future and uh or something that only you know you
2173680	2178160	know the civilization is far and away in the future we'll be able to uh to mark up on this he said
2178160	2184080	that you know we should probably start thinking about you know building uh this structure relatively
2184080	2188480	soon and and well yes it's going to require some new tech and new ingenuity and new capabilities
2188480	2194800	but um we can get going because ultimately he said if we kind of get started on it that the
2194800	2202960	kind of like this very first uh uh stage of the sphere or swarm will become operational you know
2202960	2207760	you don't need like the whole thing you don't build the whole thing and then turn it on uh we've
2207760	2212720	kind of silly um be like actually you know what I'm imagining like the scene when you're you know
2212720	2217200	you you put the lights on a Christmas tree and you hit the start button and uh it doesn't turn
2217200	2220640	on it was one of the lights is this is actually out but that's kind of like old I guess it's
2220640	2224160	old school technology I'm just imagining what you're seeing with it okay let's start up the
2224160	2230880	Dyson Swarm and the sound from the blade and that's not starting correctly so no what to do is you
2230880	2238480	create a huge chunk that is going to be uh drawing power from the sun transforming it into useful
2238480	2244000	energy and what Stuart Armstrong was arguing is that you there you then use this to now
2244000	2249760	newfound energy source to continue to fuel the construction of the Dyson Swarm and this becomes
2249760	2258000	this kind of like it becomes this exponentially improving process and no manpower will be required
2258000	2262800	because the way he envisioned it is you're going to have probes robotic uh sorry robotic devices
2262800	2269680	working in space to actually construct um these these these panels these receivers
2270640	2276640	and they would also this have to work in tandem with mining expeditions to the inner planets and
2276640	2281840	perhaps even the asteroid belt and the outer planets uh unfortunately we'd have to say goodbye to
2281840	2291040	Mercury um and possibly parts of Venus and like I said the asteroid belt and uh other places in
2291040	2295520	the uh the solar system and that clearly will create a lot of upset I mean already just when I
2295840	2299600	write about it people write get I get very angry angry letters like how dare you talk about the
2299600	2309520	dismantling of the solar system and I okay well I mean my only concern about it is that it uh it
2309520	2314400	could disrupt the kind of orbital equilibrium that we do see in the solar system that there is this
2314400	2322240	kind of like um there is this prospect where if you suddenly remove a planet from its orbital plane
2322240	2326080	it can have this rippling gravitational effects down the line we perturb the trajectories of
2326080	2330480	planets and what that does is over the course of many millions of years we can actually result in
2330480	2337040	collisions between planets uh which is not good last night check so that's that's one one possibility
2337040	2342400	but like let's let's be let's be honest like Mercury is useless right there's it's it's it's just
2343040	2347840	baked in radiation and there's nothing of value there I mean aside from just for the sake of it
2347840	2352640	being there Venus I'm not even going to speak speak to me it's interesting only from a scientific
2352640	2356400	perspective in the sense that we they could maybe help us understand our climate models a bit better
2356400	2361440	and what you know the potential risks are uh and what some like severe case situations are like for
2361440	2366000	what an atmosphere can actually do like that's pretty scary when you look at you know what because
2366000	2370000	Venus is a sister planet to our own like it's so close to us it's basically the same size as ours
2370000	2374880	yet it's a complete shell and uh what's it what happened like what's the difference between us and
2374880	2381280	that so yeah before we dismantle Venus I would like us to know how it came to be and actually
2381280	2384880	what excitingly NASA is actually considering a couple of missions finally I think one of the most
2384880	2389760	even those that are closest celestial neighbors one of the most neglected planets in the solar system
2389760	2394160	yet it should be I think a high priority that we understand it a little better obviously all the
2394160	2400160	focus is on Mars because it has this this this this historical potential for habitability certainly
2400160	2405360	doesn't have that anymore um so that's why there's all this excitement about Mars but we also think
2405360	2410240	of it as you know there's potentially you know planet B for us which again is a as I don't know
2410240	2414800	if you you were you caught this one Adam but um last year I wrote a piece called why will never
2414800	2421600	colonize Mars generated a lot of excitement and a lot of upset and I basically argued that Mars
2421600	2425200	is not what you think it is and the whole these all these ideas of like how great it's going to be
2425200	2429760	to live on Mars and colonize it and terraform and all that is a bit of a pipe dream and it's complete
2430160	2436080	um uh you know um completely neglects you know the hardships and realities of doing so
2437120	2444320	so so yeah um well yeah I agree this can be really hard in our current biological form
2444320	2450960	but by the stage we you know um build a maybe a type two Kardashev civilization we can have the
2450960	2456080	ability to sort of adapt ourselves to sort of operate in a variety of environments probably
2456080	2461200	a lot more hardship than Mars for sure and I was at the long term I was a bit cheeky in my
2461200	2465920	headline there when I said humans will never colonize Mars because it was my excuse to say
2465920	2472880	yeah post-humans can colonize Mars so that that was kind of like where I was coming at uh on that one
2472880	2478640	so uh definitely I definitely made at that point that yeah we had modified humans and that's a
2478640	2485760	different story altogether so um yeah so back to the building of the Dyson sphere uh basically
2485760	2493040	once you've created this core um uh panel then it becomes a sex financial thing and uh I mean
2493040	2497440	Armstrong's predictions were that you could do this in maybe four stages I think five stages and it
2497440	2501600	would only take you know a few decades once you went to the ball once the ball was really rolling
2502320	2508720	and I mean uh I mean this idea has been attacked uh for not just because you require the dismantling
2508720	2514400	of planets but also the time obviously the time scale I I agree um maybe when I wrote this article
2514400	2520400	about 10 or 12 years ago I maybe overstated um our ability to get into space and work into space
2520400	2526240	we're finding it to be much more difficult than we could have ever imagined and uh you know that's
2526240	2531440	just the sheer cost alone of you know rockets uh delivering rockets and we're seeing this the
2531440	2536320	private sector finally getting a bit of a handle on this but it's still the lot the launch requirements
2536320	2540640	the technological requirements the ability to actually have machines working on mercury for
2540640	2546640	example that would not you know succumb to the elements like to be fair we're still quite a ways
2546640	2552000	off from being able to do this but like I like I said one thing I will stand by is that it's not
2552000	2556000	too early to think about it you know let's let's let's let's talk about it let's make up some
2556000	2560880	plans let's maybe make some timelines like let's maybe say hey what's the tech that we need to do
2560880	2565200	this what's the material that we need to do this you know what what kind of what how would a robot
2565200	2569280	actually work on mercury to kind of dig down deep into that we need to actually access them
2569520	2573680	usable materials and what do we do with all the waste and all this stuff these are questions we
2573680	2577440	can ask right now and get some very smart people working on even if even if it's just let's say
2577440	2581600	from uh like a crowdsourced perspective obviously I think academics should be talking about this but
2581600	2585760	maybe you know just as an active community so I mean obviously you've got the Mars Society and
2585760	2591200	people talking about that um people it's just so devoted to colonizing Mars so why don't we have
2591200	2596640	you know a group of people devoted to getting the ball rolling on the creation of a dexon
2596640	2604240	swarm so uh timelines okay maybe not maybe what we what we thought but certainly I don't discount
2604960	2609600	what Armstrong suggested though that once the ball is rolling though and it does become this
2609600	2614320	awesome feedback process where now you can really in earnest build this thing rather quickly next thing
2614320	2620480	you know you've got this you've got a dexon swarm so um one of the the way again one of the real
2620480	2625360	points here in the article what and uh what Armstrong was even arguing was that again this
2625360	2631520	is something that is plausible you know this is not what Dyson was conjecturing about was
2631520	2637760	fascinatingly intriguingly um you know doable and you know it was it was it was just kind of blew
2637760	2641200	my mind to see a guy actually put pen to paper and say here's how we can do it at least at a
2641200	2646400	conceptual level that it made sense to me and I continue to think it's just a fascinating possibility
2647760	2653520	oh indeed yeah so I mean in terms of the timeline to actually bootstrap to get started in this
2653520	2658080	process seriously and start at least using some of the energy that we can harvest from the sun
2658080	2665200	with a few uh I guess um panels in place as the beginning of a Dyson swarm how long do you think
2665200	2672880	that would take? Armstrong said 40 years which is crazy but that that's what that's what that's what
2672880	2678320	he said so um 40 years to get started no oh sorry I think you know the complete completion of the
2678320	2682160	swarm you're asking me like when we can actually get started on the project to start building the
2682160	2689920	first one yeah what's your opinion on that? Oh boy um not for a few decades I mean we're still at
2689920	2696720	the stage where kind of crazy because like we're talking about like NASA's now and Congress is
2696720	2706400	earnestly talking about a mission to Mars by 20 in the 2030s for example and uh the fact is that
2706400	2713040	we're embarking on a really small step still like we're still not working on the moon we don't even
2713040	2720720	have a moon a moon an orbital moon base we haven't even been to Mars yet um you know it and we don't
2720720	2725280	know some of the uh not only do we not know the technical hurdles that await we don't know the
2725280	2733840	socio-economic hurdles that await as well um our situation here on earth can start to get so dire
2733840	2740800	in terms of the environment that uh deep space exploration and uh and work out there will have
2740800	2744400	to take a backseat to the problems that need to be addressed here at home and it's going to be
2744400	2750000	increasingly difficult for governments to justify the spending taxpayer money you know for what could
2750000	2755680	be deemed as these rather uplandish uh science fictiony uh prospect I'm not saying I agree with
2755680	2761520	that perspective I'm saying that will be a prevailing perspective so it's because of these
2761520	2767440	kind of realities that you have to temper these kinds of expectations so to answer your question
2767440	2773840	maybe not sadly maybe not for a to 100 years uh and yeah of course like I said a lot of there are a
2773840	2780080	lot of wild cards and blacks wants to consider between them both ones that can continue to
2780080	2786800	satisfy but even like blacks ones that could perhaps uh be good like let's say an artificial
2787040	2791920	that's we kind of have this kind of like uh an artificial super intelligence that that we can
2792560	2798720	kind of understand and control uh very dubious that we could do that but um let's say that we
2798720	2803680	kind of like start to offload some of these design and engineering tasks to artificial intelligence
2804320	2810320	uh and we find ways of let's say you know becoming more economically uh stable and having the means
2810320	2814880	the resources with which to launch the source of expeditions so those things kind of came together
2814880	2818640	then all that's our offer terms of when we could start to mark upon this project so that's the case
2818640	2824640	I would say you know after the 2050s uh 2060s recently I will I will add though I'm turning 50
2824640	2831760	this year this is just a an aside almost any irrelevant aside but turning 50 this year and
2831760	2835920	you start to do the mat like when I was a kid like you'd see the oh yeah you know NASA's
2835920	2840240	launching probes to this planet or this moon and it's going to take 15 years to get there or
2840240	2845200	whatever it's going to be 25 year long project and you you kind of it's easy for you to digest that
2845200	2849040	it's you know think a lot it's still far away in the future which you can digest it now like for
2849040	2854160	example there uh that NASA's going to be sending a probe to uh to tighten it's fascinating it's
2854160	2858560	going to be actually uh a drone it'll be able to fly through the atmosphere because it actually has
2858560	2863920	an atmosphere and uh yeah it's going to be it'll be landing in the mid 2030s assuming they can get
2863920	2871040	it going and yeah I'm going to be like I'll be like 64 65 years old when it happens and uh radical
2871040	2878720	life extension Adam notwithstanding I'm hoping in terms of what you know what you know what you
2878720	2882880	know what how our health can be prolonged in the future I tend to be a status cool type of a type
2882880	2887520	of a person I don't tend to assume that that's going to happen um I take I assume that I'll be
2887520	2895680	aging normally and I'll die you know at a depth you know as per the situation today it'd be wonderful
2895680	2900720	you know I could prolong my life but it does seem that I'm starting to get to a point now in in my
2900720	2906880	life where perhaps some of these longer scale uh prospects are something I'll never live to see
2907600	2913360	and uh you eventually there's going to be some kind of a project where yeah if I do the math I'll be
2913440	2918240	115 but it actually gets rolling in other words I probably won't be alive to see it
2918240	2923200	so I'm not sure why I'm bringing this up just aside from the fact that um starting to it does
2923200	2927280	affect perhaps the way you look at the future and understand that yeah you know life will absolutely
2927280	2932480	go on without you being there and of course without you being there to observe it and appreciate it
2932480	2936240	but of course that doesn't mean you should think it's still gonna not gonna happen most certainly
2936240	2940880	you should never let that prevent you know this kind of multi-generational thinking I for example
2940880	2948320	I'm a firm staunch believer that we should start to not not just talk about uh Dyson swarms
2948320	2955520	in construction let's start talking about interstellar uh expeditions you know we've got Voyager
2955520	2960160	the Voyager 2 probes you know they they're incredible but why don't we scale up something
2960160	2964880	like that you get a massive you know I think uh they're already been like Stephen Hawking talked
2964880	2972400	about this for example creating these ships with solar sails that my god like these things once they
2972400	2978720	get cooking and moving in space powered only by like uh the the particles emanating out from the sun
2978720	2983280	but then a short matter of time it'll be moving at 10 the speed of light you know that suddenly
2984160	2989040	these relativistic speeds the the nearby star systems aren't so far away anymore and now you're
2989040	2994800	talking about missions that are like what 10 40 years you know instead of like prohibitively long
2994800	2999440	like like wait like Voyager's not going to reach the first possible star system for like tens of
2999440	3004960	thousands like hundreds of thousands of years obviously that's super discouraging but anyways
3004960	3011360	point being is I would love us to start taking the long new bold ideas yeah we may not live to
3011360	3016800	see it in our own lifetime but maybe you know generations four five 10 20 from now will absolutely
3016800	3021680	yield the benefits of this it could even be potentially existentially worthwhile the sense
3021680	3027920	that it could actually get detect you know habitable systems uh to learn from the science of these
3027920	3034400	expeditions and uh so I think we should also start thinking along those lines as well yeah the idea of
3035440	3041920	astronomical waste comes to mind and population axiology or population ethics where um we should
3041920	3048880	be considering the moral relevance of people who are not yet around or like slots for life that are
3048880	3056960	not yet available can we say um and if we were to go extinct or to um I guess be damned to live
3056960	3063120	only on this sort of film on top of this rock called earth in this tiny portion of our own
3063120	3070160	galaxy let alone all the others then that would be a shame um because there's a whole lot of
3070160	3076880	matter out there that doesn't isn't being sort of used to support lives worth living um and so
3076880	3083280	yeah it there's a paper out there called um something along the lines of astronomical waste
3084480	3092000	yeah but it's quite interesting when you start thinking about the huge sheer amount of possible
3092000	3099760	lives worth living that could be cut short or just never actually be realized if we go extinct or if
3100720	3106960	we just never get off earth yeah and you know bringing it back full circle to freeman dyson
3106960	3111040	if he were here talking to us right now he'd be absolutely on board with what we're talking about
3111040	3119840	he was actually a big thinker in terms of uh the future human trajectory and uh he you know he
3119840	3124480	what did he say fair his book very famously said infinite in all directions now it's in such a
3124480	3130160	beautiful beautiful term and but he believed it you know like even thought that you know eventually
3130160	3138240	we could find ways of uh you know um prolonging the existence of a civilization um you know by
3138240	3142560	slowing i i have to forgive me if i get this a little bit wrong but basically what he was suggesting
3142560	3149280	is that uh we we dramatically slow down like the clock speed of civilization to the to the point
3149280	3155920	where it's so excruciatingly slow that the time ticks relative to the actual how time is elapsing
3155920	3161280	around it that it might as well be you know quasi infinite in terms of how long the civilization
3161280	3167440	could actually last given the constraints of of course of cosmology uh i think he came up with
3167440	3176560	these ideas back in the 70s when we saw a different view of uh cosmological evolution and development
3176560	3182640	we now know for example that the universe will eventually start to expand and expand quicker
3182640	3187360	and quicker and quicker which will preclude i think some of these uh ideas of you know finding
3187360	3191840	almost like infinite ways of prolonging human existence or post-human existence whatever will be
3192480	3199200	like 22 30 billion years from now but um yeah he was definitely online with this thinking like
3199200	3203520	like think big think bigger like that's i think that's one of the more fascinating aspects about
3203520	3208800	Freeman Dyson was how he would kind of like just take things to a level that perhaps you know
3209360	3215280	no one uh no one had before you know when we were talking about a guy who penned this thing in 1959
3215920	3222720	okay it's it's hard for us perhaps to understand how radical an idea that would be okay this is
3222720	3228080	in 1959 say hey extra trust you we're gonna build what he didn't call him Dyson's spheres and people
3228160	3233200	called it after that like they named it after him yes he actually didn't like the term that that
3233200	3238480	was named after him but i will say he got the idea from Olaf Stapleton and that very good point
3238480	3243280	actually um and thank you for bringing that up he it's not was not his idea yeah you got it from
3243280	3247200	science fiction Olaf Stapleton and perhaps even others were already talking about ideas such as this
3247920	3253280	again he just looked at it as a potential solution for you know the insatiable energy demands of a
3253280	3257600	civilization but i thought it was pretty great like when i heard that he had died a couple of days
3257600	3264400	ago i thought you know i mean i really hope that we build a Dyson swarm if not for the simple reason
3264400	3270000	that we can call it a Dyson swarm or a Dyson sphere that it would what a legacy that would be as a
3270000	3277040	thinker to have a megastructure you know of such magnitude be actually named after him and i think
3277040	3281600	i just i would just love for that to actually happen even if he didn't like the term too bad
3281600	3288880	freeman you came up with an awesome idea or at least populated popularized and more fully
3288880	3293440	articulated the idea again with all due respect to Olaf Stapleton maybe i take back what i said
3293440	3297760	make sure you call them stapleton swarms i don't know but but still i think we're pretty damn cool
3297760	3303840	we actually do call it that we we build something like that but anyways point being that how radical
3303840	3308960	must have been for him to not only just talk about megastructures but to talk about it in
3308960	3313520	the context of the search for extraterrestrial intelligence which i'm not sure that was even
3313520	3320560	determined existed in 1959 it wasn't until uh drake in the like what 1964 or so and project osma and
3320560	3326320	the first efforts at radio set he got underway so this could predates for even radio like actual
3326320	3333200	efforts for radio set city so today we can talk about amazingly we can talk about megastructures
3333200	3339760	and dyson sphere uh you know without blinking an eye and batting an eye like for example um a couple
3339760	3346240	years ago there was that uh variable star which is called boy a boy on star is this tabby star the
3346240	3352000	same thing tabby star it's the same star it's the same thing and that had this unexplainable
3352000	3359200	irregular dimming episodes and a number of you know theories were posited to explain it uh
3359920	3365920	of uh in the from a natural perspective but inevitably it got people thinking well maybe
3365920	3371840	this is actually evidence of uh and the first data point we have of an alien megastructure
3371840	3376800	and what delighted me as a journalist covering this stuff well was that i could actually just you
3376800	3380160	know matter of fact we say yeah could this could actually this is actually being entertaining as
3380160	3385360	possible and i didn't have to like like really beat people over the head to understand it and i
3385360	3388320	and appreciate it like people like oh i know i've heard of that i don't have a nice enchilas you
3388320	3391920	know or whether it'd be through the science fiction or whether just through casual conversations
3391920	3398480	becoming whereas we had to fight for dysonian city you know just tended to 15 years ago it's now
3398480	3402960	almost taken for granted that that's how we should look for extra trust with civilizations that and
3402960	3407200	now almost the the radio study almost seems anachronistic i still believe we should we should
3407200	3411680	do it don't get me wrong i still think we should listen to radio signals but now yeah let's let's
3411680	3417360	look for uh like i said other techno signatures even laser settings becoming a thing and all that so
3417360	3423120	um again but again um i just find it interesting that uh freeman dyson being the free thinker
3423120	3428160	that he was you know just had it you know just thought this is what needs to be said and thought
3428160	3437040	through and you know and not like i say is what it is i've often thought about like what others
3437040	3447520	like strong attractors could um i guess motivate a civilization to uh expand in a way which is
3447520	3453440	indetectable um and you know at least molin came out with the idea that like maybe black holes
3454000	3459440	born universes and and there's other sort of permutations and an idea and and perhaps
3460160	3467760	uh galactic civilizations engineer or optimize black holes to spew forth the types of idealized
3467760	3476320	universes for computation and and and life right um and they think that you know they sort of ascend
3476320	3483840	or transcend in some way to to a better reality or a reality more conducive towards flourishing
3484480	3489200	i kind of hope that that's possible and that's a good reason why we can't see
3489760	3496960	other civilizations out there but what are your thoughts on um i guess strategies for
3496960	3504960	civilizations to continue without being detected so again i have to work under the um the data
3504960	3511440	that we have right now which does suggest that advanced civilizations should they exist they
3511440	3518000	don't become interstellar colonists that just that's that's the assumption that i'm working under
3518640	3524800	so i'm a bit i guess i can call me like a contact pessimist or even like a you know
3525520	3531520	just you just doubt that's kind of like within our within our future uh future means so i keep
3531520	3536240	asking the question well how the why then what is this kind of modality that a civilization
3536240	3543120	would enter into that's that's that's still uh deemed of value and uh it just it mean it just
3543120	3550800	keeps coming back to this idea of uh of you know this internal existence that living within ourselves
3550800	3557360	like locally and not branching out like just finding uh you know means to uh you know perpetually have
3557360	3563360	access to resources that might mean star hopping or parking near a perpetual energy source of some
3563360	3568960	sort um but living more modestly in that sense and yeah just running you know ancestor civilizations
3568960	3575360	or hedonistic civilizations and living out you know the the the remaining duration of the cosmos
3575360	3579520	in in that manner that's kind of like the best solution that i can come up at this point that's
3579520	3586080	still that that in my opinion uh does not violate the uh the non-exclusivity issue and at the same
3586080	3591360	time um answers the question as to why we've not made contact with anybody else that maybe we're
3591360	3596640	all just inherently xenophobic and we just keep to ourselves we enter into this uh happy heaven
3596640	3602800	like modality and that's that's and then in that post-unit of happily ever after the end so
3602800	3606480	i'm not suggesting for a second that that's what will happen or that's the greatest solution to
3606480	3612720	this but it's certainly one that uh occupies some of my thought uh in terms of um what's the solution
3612720	3619680	here what's the what's actually going to happen what's a non-exclusivity issue it means that um
3619680	3624080	it has to be a solution that every single extraterrestrial civilization will independently
3624080	3629200	uh enter into and that there can't be any outliers because if there were outliers and we would have
3629760	3635280	made contact with them by now they would have made their presence known that's again
3635280	3640720	working under those kinds of uh constraints i suppose in terms of uh when used to kind of
3640720	3647200	make these sorts of uh extrapolations i guess freeman dyson did have some controversial opinions
3647200	3654800	and views um and one of them was uh that he was sort of critical of climate change models or that
3655680	3664640	whether climate change would have a serious impact on global health and viability yeah he
3664640	3669680	kind of alienated a lot of people toward the end of his life and um yeah he was not kind of on board
3669680	3675360	the whole um you know climate justice span wagon and quite the opposite and uh you know
3676240	3680720	he he said himself that you know to be a good scientist kind of like means you have to be
3680720	3685360	subversive i don't think you ever liked i think the more popular an idea you know became i think
3685360	3690160	the less inclined it was to latch on to it kind of i was looking for ways to kind of chip away at it
3690880	3697280	and climate change was certainly um one of those targets and uh yeah he kind of thought that
3697280	3704160	scientists were i think it was a bit of a climate change skeptic first of all um but even if you did
3704160	3710640	buy into the models he kind of thought well it's not so bad you know which from today's perspective
3710640	3714560	like i don't have to tell you as a someone who lives in australia like well it is kind of bad
3714560	3720240	i think it's kind of like it's a show you know it's just awful and uh like because he was saying
3720240	3724880	oh it's great that carbon dioxide is great for plants and you know create these lush environments
3724880	3730960	and um all these kinds of like this i think the hand way these sort of um you know proclamations
3730960	3735440	that it got me thinking well he's a he's a big thinker but he was also maybe sometimes spoke
3735440	3740080	outside of his immediate area of expertise and maybe didn't think through some of the repercussions
3741200	3748400	of this yeah i will say at the same time he's like the only climate skeptic or whatever you
3748400	3754080	want to call it actually i kind of he'll ring in my ear every once in a while you know like
3754080	3759120	you for example you'll study like Jurassic environments and you understand that you know
3759120	3764240	there was no polar caps at that time and the dinosaurs lived at a very unique time in our
3765360	3770400	interplanets history and understand that yeah we're the climate change is an indelible part of
3770400	3775840	this planet's history like the planet in fact the history of this planet is simply the history of
3775840	3781520	climate change and in this constant study of how the planet has changed and how animals have reacted
3781520	3786240	to this to climate change over time and that includes all kinds of different things um hominins
3786240	3791440	and uh of course dinosaurs and animals and all sorts of things so um you know you do have to
3791440	3796960	look at climate change that that lens yeah what's i don't have to remind you or your listeners
3796960	3801920	obviously this is characteristically different because we're the ones that are now responsible
3801920	3807520	for it and we're kind of uh causing this change on timescales that are unprecedented in the planet's
3807520	3813200	history like it's uh these spikes are just unreal in terms of how quickly uh we're able to now impact
3813200	3819440	upon uh the environment you know it also gets me i'm thinking even about kardashev's scale because
3819440	3824560	kardashev says talks about k-1 civilizations and you know harnessing of the entire uh energy
3824560	3830400	output of the planet one thing kardashev would not have been concerned about well at what cost
3830400	3836160	to the environment what does that mean in terms of the heat expenditure uh you know uh if a whole
3836160	3841840	planet you know is working in that way like what is what is that doing environmentally what is it
3841840	3847280	doing to sustainability is it viable sustainable is this you know is it actually creating a planet
3847280	3854720	that's actually going to be able to continue to move forward in time and uh uh and and still sustain
3854720	3860320	you know what what we would value in terms of wildlife and uh and plant life and all that sort of
3860320	3865440	stuff so um it's one thing to conjecture about is one of the things sometimes one of the most
3865440	3869920	difficult things is to project outcomes and consequences and i think maybe that's where
3869920	3875440	freeman dyson was maybe a little lacking and and i could do cavalier perhaps about what he thought
3875440	3881120	were the ill effects of climate change and and not to accuse him of this but maybe simply because
3881120	3887680	it was at the sake of being contrary and being that that that guy who was that um you know to be
3887680	3892960	that kind of deviant when it came to scientific uh to scientific thinking so that sadly will
3892960	3899760	probably be one one area in which he will not be fondly uh remembered as uh i think
3900480	3903600	we can pretty much agree that uh climate change is something that needs to be
3904240	3913120	mitigated rather than celebrated right but um yes so a lot of people have controversial opinions
3913120	3919120	and it shouldn't really detract from the value they contribute in other areas um and i think
3919120	3925200	some people like to demonize thinkers because they come up with one controversial opinion
3926160	3931360	and that can kind of be like throwing the baby out with the bathwater which is i think silly
3931360	3939440	yeah yeah no no for sure i mean uh i you know i have you know so many quote unquote heroes that
3939440	3944960	that i admire but i don't think there's a i would never say like the reason why i had to put heroes
3944960	3950080	in scare quotes is because you know whether it be carl saying it or freeman dyson or anyone of
3950080	3953680	these people that i hugely admire they're not perfect and there's always something about their
3953680	3958160	personality or something they might have done or something that they believe in that there's
3958160	3964960	absolutely not you know conform to my own beliefs or values so i i would never say that i would i
3964960	3970480	will unabashedly feel and irreservedly follow someone and declare them you know to be the
3970480	3976480	perfect hero for me that that does not exist for for me personally so i could admire the
3976480	3980640	hell out of somebody that doesn't mean i have to buy an absolutely everything that they have to say
3980640	3986880	so i kind of yeah totally agree with you yeah yeah is there any other points which you'd like to
3986880	3994480	bring up at this stage which we haven't yet covered um uh you know we we boy we we covered a lot there
3994480	3999280	i just want to just uh maybe back to tabby star just to say that it's not it i don't know we've
3999280	4004560	kind of came full circle on that it's not a megastructure um right now they're pretty sure it's
4004560	4009440	still uh uh some kind of naturalistic phenomenon and it was a fascinating paper a few months ago
4009440	4016960	suggested that what it might actually be is a disintegrating moon so what what happens in some
4016960	4023920	star systems is that uh a planet uh will at the end of its life get subsumed by its host star
4023920	4029040	and it'll bring along its moon or moons with it in this case they're saying that that did not
4029040	4037200	happen that the moon got ejected and it's slowly disintegrating um as it is also being a subsumed
4037200	4044960	by the star it's kind of creating this anomalous debris field that uh is uh uh that is infrequent in
4044960	4049840	terms of uh how it's happening and that's the explanation and i actually talked to dr boyan
4049840	4055600	about this and she thought it was an intriguing possibility so um i decided to mention that
4055600	4058640	because i didn't want your listeners to think that it was still people are still very much thinking
4058640	4065040	that it's a megastructure it's we're pretty sure it's not but i think it's pretty exciting um that
4065040	4070000	we can talk about this possibility yet at the same time you never want to you know whenever we
4070000	4074960	see something that you don't understand is put your hands and say oh my god we don't understand it
4074960	4079840	it's gotta be aliens like i think that's i'm not suggesting we should do that by no means in fact
4079840	4086480	we're talking about pulsars earlier the first pulsars that were discovered were so odd to
4086480	4090800	astronomers they had no explanation for them because these things are blinking with such
4090800	4094640	extreme rapidity and regularity like that was their first thought too and i think they're actually
4094640	4100240	in the notes they're like was like lg uh lg m's they called them or something like that which meant
4100240	4103280	like little green man or something like that basically hinting that oh my god we're maybe
4103280	4107600	discovered you know some kind of alien signature here it turned out not to be the case but there
4107600	4113200	always is this tendency that when we do see something that's super weird and it defies our
4113200	4118240	expectations there is this tendency to invoke extraterrestrial life i'm not saying that's
4118240	4123520	the healthiest thing to do it should be this kind of last resort if you will kind of like that
4123520	4127840	like the anecdote at the end of an anecdote to say after we've exhausted all these possibilities
4127840	4133440	you know a through f let's just maybe keep an open mind that it kind of maybe is consistent with what
4133440	4139520	we think is technosignature could look like it's that's all i want to say about tabby star um at
4139520	4148800	this point awesome well um i guess if you'd like to conclude what if you were to meet somebody
4149360	4157120	who was thinking about donating their large fortune towards some form of exploratory research
4157920	4161760	what would it be and how would you convince them to do something that you value
4161760	4167680	that maybe relates to our discussion today wow that's that's a heck of a question i never
4167840	4173120	really given not really giving so much thought to that like i will say that it might be an answer
4173120	4178480	that um it's kind of like unsexy uh relative to discussion or even irrelevant to the
4178480	4183120	discussions we just had but i admire for example the bill and blend the gates foundation for what
4183120	4188240	they've done in terms of being smart about where they spend their money and in particular as to
4188800	4194480	what they deem to be areas that are most in need and for example a big thing for them is
4195360	4201040	neglect the tropical diseases and uh obviously you know with the COVID-19 being what it is right
4201040	4207040	now that's not a neglect the tropical disease obviously but it just shows that we are still
4208720	4215600	victimized by microorganisms like in a way like that's just unreal you know we we like to think
4215600	4220640	that we have a handle on on nature that we don't we're not preyed upon by lions anymore you know
4220640	4225760	or wolves um but we're most certainly preyed upon by other kinds of animals and they're
4225760	4233120	microscopic in size whether it be malaria you know zika virus um you know the common flu
4233120	4239760	and the cold and now the COVID-19 uh disease it's uh i think that we need we need to continue to
4239760	4243520	spend our money and our resources on those kinds of threats because at the end of the day and at
4243520	4247760	the end of the year when you look at the uh you know the actuarial tables those are the things that
4247760	4253840	are killing us uh you know at a horrific scale you know that's what's killing us on mass and we
4253840	4260320	need to get a handle on that and similarly the back out include bacteria and bacterial infections in
4260320	4265280	that in that uh the body of thinking and we're heading toward the so-called you know antibiotic
4265280	4268880	apocalypse where there are antibiotics looks like they're not they're increasingly becoming
4268880	4273680	ineffective and we're starting to talk about you know super viruses that are even super immune to
4274640	4279520	um standard uh cocktails of antibiotics so these are the kinds of things that scare the crap out of
4279520	4286080	me and me too and it should scare your listeners as well and so yeah that's if i'm okay you know
4286080	4291840	i think that people with horrendous amounts of money should probably spend it to alleviate those
4291840	4300880	kinds of uh blights so that's how i will answer that well george it's been an amazing mind blowing
4300880	4306000	discussion i i love talking about these topics and i really appreciate the time here that was fun
4306000	4311040	to talk to the review so yeah thanks heaps and i look forward to chatting with you again in the
4311040	4324720	future absolutely me too
4330880	4331760	you
