00:00.000 --> 00:05.280
Hey everybody, let's build a Dyson Sphere. We know we want to, humanity yearns for the

00:05.280 --> 00:10.000
cosmic climb, so where do we start? Welcome to science technology in the future. Today

00:10.000 --> 00:15.200
we have Canadian futurist, science writer and ethicist George Svorsky with us. He wrote

00:15.200 --> 00:20.400
an interesting piece on how to build a Dyson Sphere in five easy steps. So we are here to

00:20.400 --> 00:26.800
discuss the hows, what's, wins and where's of doing so. George Svorsky has appeared many

00:26.800 --> 00:31.440
times in our show since 2012 discussing journalism, human enhancement, singularity,

00:31.440 --> 00:37.440
the Turing test and the AlphaGo phenomenon. He is a contributing editor at Gizmodo and IO9,

00:37.440 --> 00:42.240
the chairman of the board at the Institute for Ethics and Emerging Technologies and it's one

00:42.240 --> 00:47.920
of the directors for the rights of non-human persons program. Hey thank you so much. It's sad

00:47.920 --> 00:53.680
that we're here to discuss the passing of an iconic figure but it certainly gives us a good

00:53.680 --> 00:58.480
opportunity to delve into some of the issues that he raised over the course of his illustrious

00:58.480 --> 01:04.080
career and at times a controversial career and we'll dive in and explore some of these pretty

01:04.080 --> 01:10.800
exciting concepts. So the way that I was really introduced to the idea of Freeman Dyson was

01:10.800 --> 01:16.720
actually through Dyson Spheres, my interest in large galactic mega-scale structures. First of all,

01:16.800 --> 01:24.960
I mean what is a Dyson sphere and why would we want to build one? Yeah I mean the whole,

01:24.960 --> 01:32.080
I mean the whole thing got started for Dyson back in the late the late 50s. I think you penned

01:32.080 --> 01:37.920
this two, just a two-page essay where you just kind of got thinking that you know eventually

01:38.560 --> 01:43.680
you know like a super sophisticated, super powerful technological civilization

01:43.680 --> 01:50.160
they're going to need a lot more energy than what's you know what could possibly be provided on

01:50.160 --> 01:56.320
their home planet. So he conjectured about these hypothetical megastructures which are basically

01:56.320 --> 02:06.640
these under a massive array of solar panels that will completely envelop the sun and extract

02:06.640 --> 02:15.520
virtually all the energy that's output from the from the star. And yeah I think he had originally

02:15.520 --> 02:24.000
envisioned it as a whole fleet of satellites like a spacecraft in orbit around the sun

02:25.760 --> 02:31.680
but out of tremendous like like I would think like hundreds of kilometers of density so they

02:31.680 --> 02:34.960
would not you know they would not intersect in this fashion to each other but effectively

02:34.960 --> 02:40.880
it would kind of from a distant observer there'd be so many and so many working in concert that

02:40.880 --> 02:48.320
would effectively like be this swarm of spacecraft or really what are solar panels in orbit like I

02:48.320 --> 02:53.040
said around the sun extracting that energy and that energy could therefore be used to to power that

02:53.040 --> 03:00.000
civilization and they could continue to advance and you know develop as an advanced civilization.

03:00.800 --> 03:06.000
And he also got thinking well if this is a possibility for extraterrestrials well two

03:06.000 --> 03:10.480
things come from that one he said well it therefore represents a way for us to potentially detect

03:10.480 --> 03:15.040
the signs of extraterrestrial civilization so that thus becomes a kind of techno signature

03:15.680 --> 03:21.840
and indeed this this obviously this this giant shield that kind of you know envelops the sun

03:21.840 --> 03:27.200
is going to be absorbing a tremendous amount of heat it will then be giving off a certain amount

03:27.200 --> 03:32.160
of heat radiation so he said that and others have since speculated that we should be able to

03:32.160 --> 03:37.120
detect this infrared signature at specific bands from Earth but that'll that'll depend on the

03:37.120 --> 03:43.680
materials that are used and the amount of heat that still is able to be dissipated from the structure

03:44.480 --> 03:51.200
and yeah I mean and then the other the other the second issue that this raises is that well hey

03:51.200 --> 03:54.560
that means that's something that we might do in the future as well so this is not something exclusive

03:54.560 --> 03:59.040
for extraterrestrials it's something that future humans might want to build as well

03:59.680 --> 04:06.320
and yeah I mean it's pretty exciting as an idea I think it's a no-brainer I'm not

04:06.320 --> 04:12.000
that's funny because I'm such a huge advocate of solar power as a renewable like I yeah I like

04:12.000 --> 04:17.920
wind of course and I make some renewables but oh my god like for me like a solar is a no-brainer

04:17.920 --> 04:22.560
I have this envision like from transformers like Cybertron but instead of kind of creating

04:22.560 --> 04:27.040
Cybertron why don't we just convert Earth into this gigantic solar you know like basically a

04:27.040 --> 04:32.880
gigantic orb that's plastered in solar arrays right yeah I exaggerate but but the point is that we

04:32.880 --> 04:39.200
are absolutely squandering so much real estate on this planet that should be extracting solar

04:40.400 --> 04:46.640
you know solar energy that's otherwise going to waste of course you know we don't want to

04:46.640 --> 04:51.200
destroy it for us and things like that obviously plant life and other life need this well there's

04:51.200 --> 04:57.280
a lot of death it's isn't there yeah there's a lot of rooftops unit I mean those two things right

04:57.280 --> 05:02.640
there I mean we could just exploit those resources in terms of real estate we go a long way I think

05:02.640 --> 05:08.080
to providing some of the much needed power so but what Dyson was thinking about back in 1959

05:08.640 --> 05:13.200
again he was thinking that eventually though you know this will be unsatisfactory even if we

05:13.200 --> 05:19.040
can't harness as much as much energy as we can on the planet and what would be what would what

05:19.040 --> 05:23.760
was since we would be referred to as like a Kardashian one civilization but perhaps I'm jumping

05:23.760 --> 05:26.880
ahead of ourselves as we will get to Kardashian stuff in just a minute but it's nice that these

05:26.880 --> 05:32.080
ideas intersect with each other that a Kardashian one scale civilization would harness the entire

05:32.080 --> 05:36.880
energy available to it on this host planet where it would therefore need to graduate to a Kardashian

05:36.880 --> 05:40.640
two scale civilization where it can actually harness all of the available output from its host

05:40.640 --> 05:46.080
star and that's where Dyson Spirit provided the Dyson provided a mechanism a potential mega

05:46.080 --> 05:51.680
structure with which this could conceivably actually happen so it's kind of obviously

05:51.680 --> 05:56.560
futurists get excited by this idea because it really does present a plausible solution for our

05:57.200 --> 06:01.840
energy needs moving forward whatever those energy for whatever we want to you know convert that

06:01.840 --> 06:08.400
energy into in future whether we're running supercomputers or you know the like so so yeah

06:08.400 --> 06:11.600
that's that's that's kind of maybe that's the answer your question yeah that's kind of like

06:11.600 --> 06:16.080
what this what we haven't even got into all the different kinds of Dyson structures that

06:16.080 --> 06:21.040
can exist but that basically is you know how I'd answer your question as to why and how

06:21.040 --> 06:29.040
we're not how and why we want to build such a thing indeed yes um yeah so uh so two luminaries

06:29.040 --> 06:36.080
two amazing minds recently passed away Freeman Dyson and Nikolai Kardashev no I'm not talking

06:36.080 --> 06:42.720
about the Kardashians folks in case you haven't heard of like the Nikolai Kardashev here's a guy

06:42.720 --> 06:49.120
who came up with civilizations the scales of civilization and and what sort of resources

06:49.120 --> 06:55.440
they'd be using and how large they'd be and so yeah there's a there's three Kardashev scales do you

06:55.440 --> 07:01.360
want to give us a brief yeah yeah sure and again very much a contemporary not the Kardashev scale

07:01.360 --> 07:06.400
yeah the Kardashian scale is coming completely different we'll save that for another podcast

07:07.200 --> 07:13.760
yeah so Freeman Dyson and Nikolai Kardashev obviously contemporaries so whereas Freeman Dyson

07:13.760 --> 07:20.960
was running with Dyson Spears in 1959 I believe it was Kardashev in 1966 conceived of the Kardashev

07:20.960 --> 07:30.640
scale and again it was a very simple scale uh one to three and you know he was to him like this

07:30.720 --> 07:37.920
this way he was a soviet astrophysicist and to him you know energy availability was a

07:37.920 --> 07:43.440
massive metric like it meant everything in terms of how you would you know really define a stage of

07:43.440 --> 07:50.480
civilization and he got this idea well eventually you know a civilization should be able to harness

07:50.480 --> 07:55.840
all the you know all the energy that it can possibly extract just on its home planet and that can be

07:55.840 --> 07:59.760
you know obviously just we're just talking about solar so that can be incoming solar but can be

07:59.760 --> 08:03.840
anything else it can be wind it can be currents and all that but eventually that's there's only so

08:03.840 --> 08:10.320
much you can extract once you've kind of hit that cap you're what he would call a Kardashev one scale

08:10.320 --> 08:16.640
civilization and the next was a civilization that can then harness the entire energy output of its

08:16.640 --> 08:23.520
sun that's a Kardashev two scale and perhaps more radically I don't want to say more speculative

08:23.600 --> 08:29.600
because all of this is speculative but more radically he also conjectured about a type three

08:30.320 --> 08:35.200
Kardashev scale civilization which can harness the entire energy output of the host galaxy

08:35.200 --> 08:40.720
which when you think about how many millions billions of stars are in the Milky Way that's a

08:40.720 --> 08:45.840
lot of energy that's a you know mix of wonder you know at that point you know that that that

08:45.840 --> 08:49.920
point is beyond human comprehension to understand what that civilization would be like and what

08:49.920 --> 08:54.000
they could possibly use that much energy for it gets in it is kind of maybe like godlike

08:55.040 --> 09:01.680
the state of being that again it's difficult to to imagine so oh man I looked at some of these

09:01.680 --> 09:07.680
numbers and look it's hard to make intuitive sense oh I know they're just so ridiculously yeah the

09:07.680 --> 09:13.280
exponentials are massive and yeah like the orders of magnitude beyond orders of magnitude beyond

09:13.280 --> 09:17.280
orders of magnitude it's because the point where it doesn't the numbers that you suggest that

09:17.360 --> 09:23.360
of them they just don't mean and it just doesn't make any more sense to us I think even like to

09:23.360 --> 09:28.800
think about a Kardashev one scale civilization is still enough to kind of make my to make me real

09:28.800 --> 09:33.200
in terms of what that would actually represent let alone you know a Dyson sphere capable civilization

09:34.000 --> 09:38.880
and I mean since I mean that's a great scale and it got a lot of conversation going on the

09:38.880 --> 09:43.040
late great Carl Sagan uh loved the idea and he thought hey why don't we actually kind of dive

09:43.040 --> 09:47.840
into this a little bit break it down a little bit kind of came up with a schema for you know

09:47.840 --> 09:53.280
creating incremental versions of Kardashev scale so according to his measure so for example today

09:53.280 --> 10:00.800
earth and earth today human civilization would be about a 0.7 like a 0.75 on the scale so we're

10:00.800 --> 10:05.680
gonna like we're like three quarters of the way there to be a full k1 civilization and similarly

10:05.680 --> 10:11.120
they get out like 1.2 1.5 or whatever you know obviously if you're working from a Kardashev

10:11.120 --> 10:17.520
two to three you could be a Kardashev you know 2.0000006 you probably that's a ridiculous you

10:17.520 --> 10:23.440
know because you may be at that point in part is let's say 10% of the uh the Milky Way so these

10:23.440 --> 10:29.040
kind of make sense and but even others are taking inspiration from uh Kardashev and come up with

10:29.040 --> 10:35.280
other ideas you know for example the amount of space let's say that a civilization has uh as occupied

10:35.280 --> 10:40.240
so let's say if it's now kind of dominates its entire solar its entire star system well that's

10:40.240 --> 10:44.400
could be a certain level or the amount of infer this is not one that I'm particularly partial to

10:45.280 --> 10:53.840
and I believe Carl Sagan also promoted this idea was that it was the amount of information available

10:53.840 --> 11:00.880
to a civilization and I believe you kind of did this across the scale of A to Z so you could have

11:00.880 --> 11:06.960
whereas A is like hardly any you know level of information and set as like I forget the way

11:06.960 --> 11:12.240
what it was the the actual metric that he used but it was that that was like the end of the scale

11:12.240 --> 11:16.160
so I believe he said that we were like at an H level so we were like we're like a Kardashev

11:16.160 --> 11:22.640
so we were like we're like at a 0.75 H type civilization right now in terms of like not the

11:22.640 --> 11:26.800
energy that we have available to ourselves and the amount of information processing that we're

11:26.800 --> 11:32.000
capable of uh of engaging in and I think that those two things there are I think a very potent

11:32.000 --> 11:36.000
measures you know where you're at there's of course it doesn't measure things like you know

11:36.000 --> 11:40.080
gross domestic product that doesn't measure things like you know social well-being and

11:40.080 --> 11:44.880
health factors um and I mean there's so many different ways I think you could still drill

11:44.880 --> 11:51.600
down and come up with different ways of describing like the technological or social or political or

11:51.600 --> 11:58.640
whatever aspect is important too in terms of the development of a civilization whether it be

11:58.640 --> 12:02.320
ourselves whether it be an extraterrestrial level civilization and I think we'll always be biased

12:02.320 --> 12:08.160
but what we think is a good metric of progress um you know so you know who knows maybe in a

12:08.160 --> 12:13.520
hundred years from now we'll have a completely different sense as to what the direction and

12:13.520 --> 12:18.960
the developmental trajectory that we would be desirable for uh an advancing uh civilization

12:18.960 --> 12:23.360
such as our own and you know you can't speak to what that what that might actually be and maybe

12:23.360 --> 12:29.920
if you look at for example maybe it could be the amount of um you know renewable uh energy

12:29.920 --> 12:35.200
available to a civilization outside of uh non-renewables that'd be a good one I'd be

12:35.200 --> 12:41.040
fascinated to see that you know that scale put you know put aside to that or if you were partial

12:41.040 --> 12:46.800
to things like you know the hedonistic imperative uh or you know shadow engineering you know maybe

12:47.680 --> 12:53.200
how far are we to toward that goal like and how many and how many individuals both human

12:53.200 --> 13:00.160
and non-human animal on the planet are in a kind of uh entering into a state of uh of

13:00.160 --> 13:06.160
hedonism as opposed to the kind of uh modality that we find ourselves in uh today so different

13:06.160 --> 13:10.080
there's different ways on all this then you know that's Kardashian but that kind of got us thinking

13:10.080 --> 13:16.400
about you know um the ways in which we can um you know conceive about uh you know how we describe

13:16.400 --> 13:23.040
the state of a civilization yeah indeed yeah I should uh preface that I am partial to the hedonistic

13:23.040 --> 13:28.480
imperative I've done a lot of interviews with David um although I don't think to me I just

13:28.480 --> 13:34.160
I'm not quite ready to commit to pleasure being the only metric that's important I think uh

13:34.160 --> 13:41.360
sensitivity to novelty is also very important and uh yeah um and the ability to to make progress

13:42.160 --> 13:51.040
intelligence and um yeah so yeah wow it's it's it's amazing how large theoretically civilizations

13:51.040 --> 13:57.600
could get um but it's been conjectured and I'm also a little bit worried that we can't see any

13:57.600 --> 14:03.760
evidence of other civilizations doing this yeah and hence this this ties into the Fermi Paradox

14:03.760 --> 14:10.160
right no Drake equation absolutely I mean first and foremost um we can almost write off Kardashian

14:10.160 --> 14:16.480
three as a possibility because you know our our astronomical observations uh seem to be in violation

14:16.480 --> 14:23.440
of that that idea you know we look up into the sky and uh we see no evidence of uh of you know

14:24.160 --> 14:30.400
galaxies that have been completely uh re-engineered or in or away somehow obscured

14:30.960 --> 14:37.840
um by um you know this massive use of uh of like Dysonian type megastructures and there have been

14:37.840 --> 14:42.800
actually this is actually not something I just you know I'm not just idly saying this to you

14:42.800 --> 14:50.560
there have actually been specific um astronomical observations looking for um these sorts of signatures

14:50.560 --> 14:56.880
coming from other galaxies and obviously these studies aren't to be all an end all you know maybe

14:56.880 --> 15:02.720
other ways of searching for these cloaked galaxies that are out there but we have yet to kind of see

15:02.720 --> 15:07.680
such a thing so right off the bat it's like oh I don't know I mean I also think just I mean

15:08.960 --> 15:12.720
it's kind of like you suggested it does bring the Fermi Paradox to mind because maybe we should

15:12.720 --> 15:17.280
be seeing these like even if we are looking potentially you know hundreds of millions

15:17.280 --> 15:22.160
or billions of light years away because obviously we're looking deep deep deep back into time

15:22.720 --> 15:27.040
you know like we have for example special lens that could show us the universe or the cosmos

15:27.040 --> 15:32.880
outside of the Hubble bubble that we're in maybe it would be a dark universe and maybe

15:32.880 --> 15:39.040
that we're at a special a special time in our universe's development where galaxies are you know

15:40.400 --> 15:47.120
starting to become subsumed by the intelligences which they've given birth to but more locally

15:47.120 --> 15:53.040
to the Milky Way again the searches have only begun like we've only been talking about Dysonian

15:53.040 --> 15:59.120
SETI for I'd say but the last 10 or 15 years and again the term Dysonian SETI again we can

15:59.120 --> 16:03.360
that's a tip of the hat to Freeman Dyson so again thank you for for that and

16:05.280 --> 16:12.080
with that the idea behind Dysonian SETI is in addition to looking for traces of Dyson spheres

16:12.080 --> 16:18.640
or shovels or swarms or whatever we should be looking for any kind of techno artifact and in

16:18.640 --> 16:25.600
particular mega-scale engineering because there could be many different kinds of things that advanced

16:26.160 --> 16:29.760
extraterrestrial civilizations would do that would leave some kind of a signature for us to

16:29.760 --> 16:36.400
be able to detect it could be everything from pollution and heat waste you know and back to

16:36.400 --> 16:41.440
pollution like for example even planets that are of an unnaturally high level of carbon dioxide or

16:41.440 --> 16:45.600
have been other kind of chemical compounds that are not consistent with what we know about the

16:45.600 --> 16:49.920
known laws of physics in terms of what can autonomously be generated through natural processes

16:50.960 --> 16:57.360
it could be traces of s you know engines or the rearranging of stars or again or even just very

16:57.360 --> 17:04.240
straightforwardly a you know a Dyson shell itself as we were alluding to earlier and even

17:04.240 --> 17:08.560
what's also fascinating is that there's constantly you know new thinking in terms of where we should

17:08.560 --> 17:14.960
be looking so recent papers said hey you know what like never mind like plain old stars like

17:14.960 --> 17:19.920
we should be looking at pulsars for Dyson instructors that what they will do is that

17:19.920 --> 17:26.080
that makes more sense to create what's like a Dyson like a Dyson ring is really what it would be

17:26.080 --> 17:30.480
so just you can imagine a ring around a pulsar and I'm sure your viewers and listeners can imagine

17:30.480 --> 17:37.360
that as the pulsars spewing those concentrated streams of energy it would be they would be

17:37.360 --> 17:42.240
orientated along the ring the interior of the ring and it would be such power you know that

17:43.040 --> 17:48.000
in such efficiency that you don't need you don't need to build such a massive structure

17:49.600 --> 17:53.920
you know right now like for example we wanted to build a Dyson shell that completely enveloped

17:53.920 --> 17:58.640
our sun here in our own solar system I think Andrew Sandberg is probably the leading guy that's

17:58.640 --> 18:04.480
done this math among others and it's like yeah like you got to take apart Mercury probably

18:04.480 --> 18:08.800
take a huge chunk out of Venus and let's go dive into the cores of the gas giants and next

18:08.800 --> 18:13.680
you know like we're kind of starting to run out of actual material in the in our own solar system

18:13.680 --> 18:19.200
to build such a thing so there is kind of like a prohibitive nature to to that as well so if you

18:19.200 --> 18:23.840
if you can be more economical in terms of the material that you need to to build then why not

18:23.840 --> 18:29.600
you know exploit perhaps better sources of that energy such as pulsars and there's even talk of

18:29.600 --> 18:35.760
like for example creating similar structures around a black hole so what you do is let's say you know

18:35.760 --> 18:42.560
black holes what they do is when they're uh when they're pulling in material they also spew a stream

18:42.560 --> 18:52.240
of high energetic jet of photons so what you can do is I'll likewise set up a massive you know a raise

18:52.240 --> 18:56.800
energy extracting a raise at the at the exit point there where the jet is streaming out

18:56.800 --> 19:01.520
and you know that's your turbo your energy turbine for lack of a better word that that works there

19:01.600 --> 19:06.400
or we can like deliberately shove a star or several several stars into a black hole to

19:06.400 --> 19:13.280
even create facilitate this process and create even more output for us so um maybe it's not so

19:13.280 --> 19:18.800
much a passive thing in terms of just some and capturing our star as it is going out there and

19:18.800 --> 19:24.160
finding better places to exploit but now at this point really what we're talking about is we're now

19:24.160 --> 19:28.720
escalating down that Kardashian scale we're now definitely I would say you gotta start at a k

19:29.040 --> 19:37.040
two and then you know I don't think you go from k one to having you know a pulsar capable

19:37.040 --> 19:41.120
Dyson shell I think you gotta you graduate towards you know to those you know means of

19:41.120 --> 19:49.840
k ability and as you're working your way toward that k uh that uh I guess toward that k three status

19:49.840 --> 19:56.320
so um so yeah um I forgot even what the initial question was Adam you have to remind me what

19:57.200 --> 20:03.200
well you know what um I'm I'm just wondering like I guess we spoke about like a um what it means to

20:04.080 --> 20:09.920
to not see any evidence of galactic structures or expansion of civilizations out there and we

20:09.920 --> 20:14.720
we started to speak about the Fermi paradox and and Drake equation I brought up and

20:14.720 --> 20:21.600
Robin Hansen brought up the great filter argument and he described the that we should be concerned

20:21.600 --> 20:27.520
if there aren't any galactic spanning civilizations out there because it decreases the likelihood

20:27.520 --> 20:32.400
that we will be able to reach that sort of status ourselves that will likely go extinct

20:34.320 --> 20:40.720
yeah uh it's a very potent uh an upsetting idea and uh yeah I mean the the search for

20:41.280 --> 20:48.160
Dyson instructors has only really just begun um so that was just to be fair but there have been

20:48.800 --> 20:55.600
searches and nothing has come up yet but more more practically I suppose uh considering the

20:55.600 --> 21:01.360
contributions of Enrico Fermi um it shouldn't even matter uh whether or not we see these spheres

21:01.360 --> 21:09.840
or not what matters is that we we just seem to be uh completely um out of touch with other

21:09.840 --> 21:14.960
extraterrestrial civilizations we see no no signs of anything they never they don't appear to travel

21:14.960 --> 21:21.600
through the solar system um and what that means is is that and that for the casual listener that

21:21.600 --> 21:25.280
might be the world I you know maybe you know maybe there've been tons of you know aliens that

21:25.280 --> 21:30.240
sit through our solar system and and certainly while there's a I suppose a chance of that

21:31.360 --> 21:35.280
there is a general feeling in the futurist community and those who are engaged in this

21:35.280 --> 21:41.360
kind of deep deep kind of speculation that look when a and when when we're when we're talking

21:41.360 --> 21:44.480
about these advanced civilizations they're not just going out on field trips you know

21:44.480 --> 21:48.960
at holidays to visit star systems what we're talking about are is are expanding bubbles of

21:48.960 --> 21:55.680
the civilization itself and that when it reaches another star system uh it doesn't just you know

21:55.680 --> 22:01.680
pass through it actually will make it its own it'll actually adopt it build its own probably

22:01.680 --> 22:07.120
you know extract all the resources it possibly can to continue to fuel its civilizations uh spread

22:07.200 --> 22:14.000
including building a distance here around uh the star of that system completely transforming it

22:14.000 --> 22:19.520
even more speculative everything and everything we're saying is so super specular but why not

22:19.520 --> 22:24.240
let's just keep going if then you get some objectives like oh Star Trek Prime Directive

22:24.240 --> 22:28.960
they come here and they'd be like oh there's intelligent civilization on earth we have to

22:28.960 --> 22:34.640
leave them alone because it's Prime Directive like no no no no no like that what the the

22:34.640 --> 22:39.120
very least what they would do is uh well destroy us but i doubt that that's the case i think more

22:39.120 --> 22:45.440
plausibly than uplift us so within a snap of the finger they would basically uh integrate us within

22:45.440 --> 22:50.960
their own civilization by whatever means is available to them so that's become part of the

22:50.960 --> 22:55.440
organism become part of the board collective we'd be subsumed into their civilization hopefully it

22:55.440 --> 23:01.520
would be a benign and uh enlightened uplift and not a like the board is obviously as a dystopian

23:01.520 --> 23:07.120
scenario as it gets uh you would hope that that's not the kind of uh assimilation that would

23:07.120 --> 23:12.080
happen and instead what i mean uplift i mean in the truest kind of like you know sense where we

23:12.080 --> 23:19.360
would be uh you know bioengineer uh reconfigurated to be this kind of post biological uh entity that

23:19.360 --> 23:24.800
they themselves are most assuredly uh that they most assuredly have become i'm not imagining

23:24.800 --> 23:32.000
green aliens visiting us i'm imagining you know um uh machine minds digital beings passing through

23:32.000 --> 23:40.000
here uh transforming you know the galaxy uh as they expand out through the milky way so yes so i

23:40.000 --> 23:44.640
just stand step back a bit so yes it does not appear that we have been visited by extraterrestrial

23:44.640 --> 23:49.680
civilizations why because everything looks pretty peaceful natural uh you know in a as that currently

23:49.680 --> 23:53.840
you know that we've nothing but we're not touched we're not touched solar system so

23:55.360 --> 24:00.640
um and as far as we can tell you know as we look out into the galaxy it looks like all of the other

24:00.640 --> 24:05.600
star systems in our galaxy are the same of the same way although it's we still we have yet to see

24:05.600 --> 24:11.920
any sign of something that's you know undeniably uh inalienably uh artificial in nature everything

24:11.920 --> 24:17.840
this does appear to be out there we look out in space it's very these are all natural processes

24:17.840 --> 24:23.040
everything fits in nice and cosily you know within the laws of physics as we know it so there's no

24:23.040 --> 24:31.840
reason for us to believe that that we're looking into uh you know a highly technified uh galaxy so

24:32.480 --> 24:37.440
that's that's kind of essentially i mean that's probably taking what Fermi said a little too far

24:37.440 --> 24:42.400
all his observation was like oh my god like we you know we we should have definitely seen somebody

24:42.400 --> 24:50.400
by now like uh what he what's what's what's potent about the Fermi paradox is he basically

24:50.400 --> 24:54.800
eliminated time as a factor because that what would you a common argument is like oh there

24:54.800 --> 25:02.400
hasn't been enough time uh for civilizations to occupy the entire galaxy um and that's fundamentally

25:02.400 --> 25:09.520
wrong uh there has been more than enough time our galaxy is really really old and has been able to

25:09.520 --> 25:16.080
host a biological life for a very long time uh long enough such that uh you know this galaxy

25:16.080 --> 25:21.920
should have been colonized you know not just once but multiple times yet it's not it hasn't happened

25:22.480 --> 25:27.200
and that's kind of alarming and that's what you know Robin Hansen has said well maybe it's because

25:28.160 --> 25:33.440
it doesn't happen that there is this kind of great filter in effect where that you know no civilization

25:33.440 --> 25:44.160
can and there's a certain developmental stage that nobody can get past and it could it might be

25:44.160 --> 25:50.320
self-destruction of some sort it i mean it could be let's say a technological a complete you know

25:50.320 --> 25:56.880
technological hurdle um even if you even go for example it could even go back in time to the uh the

25:56.880 --> 26:03.600
the the rise of uh you know uh from you know single sub-life to multi-cellular life and that

26:03.600 --> 26:07.360
that's the case that's actually amazing new that's the best news i could possibly share with anybody

26:07.360 --> 26:11.200
today because it means we've actually passed the great filter and that we're freaks we shouldn't

26:11.200 --> 26:16.480
actually even be here and we might even be the only civilization in the entire universe for

26:16.480 --> 26:20.880
certainly in the galaxy that somehow we leaked through this filter where you know no other

26:20.880 --> 26:24.560
planet that was even possible so that that's we don't in other words we don't know if the filters

26:24.560 --> 26:30.320
behind us or if it's still ahead of us personally i'm inclined to think that it's it's ahead of us

26:30.320 --> 26:35.360
that we're heading toward our daily our inevitable doom and that there's something that will prevent

26:35.360 --> 26:41.840
us from building dyson spheres and becoming a kardash of you know you know 2.4 civilizations

26:41.840 --> 26:46.720
and so on which is a kind of depressing thought but unfortunately that's potentially where the

26:46.720 --> 26:52.320
evidence is leading us in terms of trying to understand you know our future there were other

26:52.320 --> 26:58.560
possibilities of course i mean this is quite alarming but it's also um a great motivation

26:58.560 --> 27:06.080
to be extra careful and to do whatever we can to increase the likelihood of um becoming aware

27:06.080 --> 27:12.640
of potential filter should be stepping right into one and mitigate the likelihood that that'll

27:13.440 --> 27:19.200
wipe us out like all filters you know something gets through like a great filter is considered

27:19.200 --> 27:26.400
like to be many like like robert hanson described it as a whole like range of things but um like

27:26.400 --> 27:33.280
steps going up a staircase now some some life doesn't make it beyond the first step some life

27:33.280 --> 27:39.200
makes it beyond the second and third and fourth maybe we're on the 16th and there's a 17 18 19

27:39.200 --> 27:45.840
20th before we reach a technological mature civilization um so hopefully they don't like

27:45.920 --> 27:51.520
squash us out of existence before we do that right yes it's an interesting thought and uh

27:51.520 --> 27:55.680
i mean we there's no shortage of threats in our future i mean we could we could go on and on about

27:55.680 --> 27:59.520
artificial superintelligence we could talk about molecular nanotechnology we can talk about you

27:59.520 --> 28:04.480
know deliberately engineered viruses and on and on and on not to mention the nuclear threat which

28:04.480 --> 28:10.720
remains an apocalyptic uh risk um so there's still that and like i said things that we could probably

28:10.720 --> 28:15.200
invent that we don't even know are possible but there's also nothing to consider is that

28:15.200 --> 28:21.120
maybe there are modalities of existence that advanced life you know um kind of escapes into

28:21.120 --> 28:26.960
that doesn't involve you know uh you know this kind of you know colonization way that we've been

28:26.960 --> 28:33.520
talking about um yet you know at the same time these these solutions have to do two things that

28:33.520 --> 28:39.520
has to satisfy the energy requirements needed to enter into that desirable modality of existence

28:39.520 --> 28:43.600
and it has to be a solution that applies to every other single uh advanced extraterrestrial

28:43.600 --> 28:48.480
civilization out there not just the subset because when it didn't apply to every uh advanced sieve

28:49.360 --> 28:53.920
then at least some would decide to embark upon colonization campaigns and again the solution

28:54.560 --> 28:58.640
has to take that into consideration has to come up with a like i said like a solution that's like

28:58.640 --> 29:05.760
well what what's to prevent everybody from venturing out and reworking the uh Milky Way

29:05.760 --> 29:10.320
in their own image so that's that to consider well there's yeah exactly there's a prism

29:10.320 --> 29:17.920
prisoner's dilemma right where um if you're ever aware that you have galactic neighbors

29:17.920 --> 29:24.320
or that you are suspicious that one you have galactic neighbors you're going to try um and get

29:24.320 --> 29:30.880
all the resources that you can to preemptively protect yourself or even use to attack this

29:30.880 --> 29:37.280
potential neighbor so that they don't do exactly the same thing everybody like would be thinking

29:37.280 --> 29:44.320
of the same thing um let's reduce let's let's grab the resources so that we can defend and attack

29:45.200 --> 29:50.240
and perhaps even preemptively strike because our neighbors might be also thinking of

29:50.240 --> 29:55.280
preemptively striking whether they're aggressive or not they may decide that that's just the most

29:55.280 --> 30:01.840
rational self-interested thing to do yeah that's a very depressing thought i mean uh it's uh and

30:01.840 --> 30:05.200
i love that you invoke the prisoner's dilemma there and it does seem that that's kind of the

30:05.200 --> 30:09.600
situation like you know what do you do with partial information you know what do you do you

30:09.600 --> 30:15.520
know when you're not entirely sure what um you know a cohort is what kind of decisions a cohort

30:15.520 --> 30:21.040
is going to make and yeah just the whole maxian concept you therefore unleash a whole fleet of

30:21.040 --> 30:27.840
berserker probes and sterilize the uh the Milky Way before you know a berserker uh you know swarm

30:27.840 --> 30:32.880
you know uh wipes you up uh again that's another i find also find it fascinating maybe more

30:32.880 --> 30:38.480
optimistically that we also have no evidence of berserker probes again a berserker probe is um

30:39.120 --> 30:44.800
this idea that uh instead of like happy von Neumann probes that are self-replicating probes that go

30:44.800 --> 30:49.440
out there and do exploratory work or even colonization work um and then again like I said they

30:49.440 --> 30:55.120
self-replicate and they continue to spread and spread and spread in a very happy way um uh berserker

30:55.120 --> 31:01.680
probes just simply go out and uh just destroy uh basically they're sterilization waves and

31:01.680 --> 31:06.480
then it would be it would be well it could be one of several reasons as to why this can happen

31:06.480 --> 31:12.800
well one is just pure like malevolence just to like create this kind of scorched earth policy or

31:12.800 --> 31:19.360
scorched galaxy scorched galaxy he has scorched galaxy policy to bring just as a protective

31:19.360 --> 31:25.280
measure so a defensive measure um it could be uh like a rogue ai has gone completely you know

31:25.280 --> 31:30.480
mad and it's just you know uh you know or just as or just again I don't want to speculate on

31:30.480 --> 31:37.360
the reasons but I mean it's it's the fact is that we've not actually seen such a way make our

31:37.360 --> 31:42.320
and make us way through our galaxy uh simply because we're here uh we're talking about berserker

31:42.320 --> 31:44.800
probes so if you're talking about berserker probes they're probably things that they don't

31:44.800 --> 31:50.080
actually exist uh so that's how like I said it'd be more optimistic way of looking at it

31:52.080 --> 31:58.400
yeah that's true um now you've done like you've recorded like a whole taxonomy of different

31:58.400 --> 32:05.680
types of like possible von Neumann probes right um yeah and you you you're in discussions with

32:05.680 --> 32:12.160
aliezer and what was it nick buster maybe and is sandberg um trying to sort of lay out at least

32:12.160 --> 32:17.280
some of these different yeah one of the ones um this came out of a discussion at uh chicago in

32:17.280 --> 32:25.280
two 2008 i think transvision and uh it's kind of like aliezer the greatest term for you call it

32:25.280 --> 32:30.320
the whack-a-mole hypothesis which is this idea that you that yeah that you have kind of like

32:30.320 --> 32:34.720
berserker probes do exist but they're they're they're they're they're they're discriminant as

32:34.720 --> 32:41.840
opposed to indiscriminate so like similar to like uh the the monolith on the moon uh in 2001

32:41.840 --> 32:45.840
it's just hanging out kind of waiting for us to reach a certain developmental stage

32:45.840 --> 32:50.640
and then it's kind of like kicks into action and it does what it does uh again what what a

32:50.640 --> 32:56.640
wonderful idea by Arthur C Clarke but anyways uh so the idea of the of the whack-a-mole uh

32:56.640 --> 33:03.200
discriminant probe is that it's waiting simply to see what becomes of us uh after the as a result

33:03.200 --> 33:08.560
of our own technological singularity that one of the big things that Yadkowski talks about is that

33:08.560 --> 33:13.040
there isn't necessarily just one kind of artificial super intelligence that can emerge that there's a

33:13.040 --> 33:19.920
whole family of different types that can come out of the technological singularity we just don't know

33:19.920 --> 33:24.880
what kind we're going to produce and nor do the aliens know what kind we're going to produce

33:24.880 --> 33:30.320
whether it's a happy version or a sad version so let's say it's hanging out there and we can't

33:30.320 --> 33:38.400
detect it it it's it sees it oh we've passed the technological singularity and it's a oh it's a good

33:38.400 --> 33:42.720
good ai we're going to let them live and we're going to just let them be or integrate us or whatever

33:42.720 --> 33:47.680
or if it's a potentially dangerous artificial super intelligence when they even threatens

33:47.680 --> 33:55.440
the aliens is uh ongoing survival then it will extinguish us and that's the end of that so that's

33:55.440 --> 34:01.920
just that's one idea and um uh and even as another idea for these uh self-replicating or not even

34:01.920 --> 34:05.920
self-replicating but just this idea of probe technology Andrew Sandberg has also speculated

34:05.920 --> 34:10.400
about uh kind of like policing probes which is kind of like maybe a more enlightened idea what

34:10.400 --> 34:15.120
you were suggesting earlier about uh you know going out just you know terminating uh potential

34:15.120 --> 34:21.520
threats is just basically exactly that just kind of like policing and uh kind of just assessing and

34:21.520 --> 34:27.040
just uh making sure that any any threats that or anything that's coming in is what was desirable

34:27.040 --> 34:31.200
rather than uh than you know than potential threat so in other words we may not have to

34:31.200 --> 34:37.120
be a prisoner's dilemma sort of situation we can maybe have this kind of intermediary situation

34:37.120 --> 34:40.640
where we can kind of just get a sense as to the intentions of that extraterrestrial civilization

34:40.640 --> 34:46.240
but um yeah there's uh there's different you know ways of thinking about this problem

34:47.280 --> 34:55.120
oh absolutely and that's a whole whack-a-mole or whack-a-civilization idea brings up some absurd

34:55.120 --> 35:07.440
visuals in my head yes um yeah so well I guess you've also been given us a very uh interesting

35:08.320 --> 35:15.840
step-by-step description of how we could bootstrap a um a galactic civilization starting with a

35:15.840 --> 35:21.920
Dyson sphere or a Dyson swarm usually people um mean Dyson swarms when they say Dyson spheres

35:21.920 --> 35:28.400
and not a thing that sort of shell with gravity problems um yeah so do you want to just step us

35:28.400 --> 35:35.600
through sure and to be clear and to be clear this idea is uh is not my own it's uh it was

35:35.600 --> 35:41.120
Stuart Armstrong from Oxford University who first articulated this particular model for

35:42.000 --> 35:48.880
or like you suggested bootstrapping the Dyson sphere and what I did was I kind of distilled

35:48.880 --> 35:55.600
his ideas and popularized it and I've been happy to talk about talk about it ever since but definitely

35:55.600 --> 36:01.280
he deserves full credit for this idea so what it is is what he was saying is that really that

36:01.280 --> 36:07.440
within short order we will um be able to start working on this it is not something that we should

36:07.440 --> 36:13.680
think of as you know being so far away in the future and uh or something that only you know you

36:13.680 --> 36:18.160
know the civilization is far and away in the future we'll be able to uh to mark up on this he said

36:18.160 --> 36:24.080
that you know we should probably start thinking about you know building uh this structure relatively

36:24.080 --> 36:28.480
soon and and well yes it's going to require some new tech and new ingenuity and new capabilities

36:28.480 --> 36:34.800
but um we can get going because ultimately he said if we kind of get started on it that the

36:34.800 --> 36:42.960
kind of like this very first uh uh stage of the sphere or swarm will become operational you know

36:42.960 --> 36:47.760
you don't need like the whole thing you don't build the whole thing and then turn it on uh we've

36:47.760 --> 36:52.720
kind of silly um be like actually you know what I'm imagining like the scene when you're you know

36:52.720 --> 36:57.200
you you put the lights on a Christmas tree and you hit the start button and uh it doesn't turn

36:57.200 --> 37:00.640
on it was one of the lights is this is actually out but that's kind of like old I guess it's

37:00.640 --> 37:04.160
old school technology I'm just imagining what you're seeing with it okay let's start up the

37:04.160 --> 37:10.880
Dyson Swarm and the sound from the blade and that's not starting correctly so no what to do is you

37:10.880 --> 37:18.480
create a huge chunk that is going to be uh drawing power from the sun transforming it into useful

37:18.480 --> 37:24.000
energy and what Stuart Armstrong was arguing is that you there you then use this to now

37:24.000 --> 37:29.760
newfound energy source to continue to fuel the construction of the Dyson Swarm and this becomes

37:29.760 --> 37:38.000
this kind of like it becomes this exponentially improving process and no manpower will be required

37:38.000 --> 37:42.800
because the way he envisioned it is you're going to have probes robotic uh sorry robotic devices

37:42.800 --> 37:49.680
working in space to actually construct um these these these panels these receivers

37:50.640 --> 37:56.640
and they would also this have to work in tandem with mining expeditions to the inner planets and

37:56.640 --> 38:01.840
perhaps even the asteroid belt and the outer planets uh unfortunately we'd have to say goodbye to

38:01.840 --> 38:11.040
Mercury um and possibly parts of Venus and like I said the asteroid belt and uh other places in

38:11.040 --> 38:15.520
the uh the solar system and that clearly will create a lot of upset I mean already just when I

38:15.840 --> 38:19.600
write about it people write get I get very angry angry letters like how dare you talk about the

38:19.600 --> 38:29.520
dismantling of the solar system and I okay well I mean my only concern about it is that it uh it

38:29.520 --> 38:34.400
could disrupt the kind of orbital equilibrium that we do see in the solar system that there is this

38:34.400 --> 38:42.240
kind of like um there is this prospect where if you suddenly remove a planet from its orbital plane

38:42.240 --> 38:46.080
it can have this rippling gravitational effects down the line we perturb the trajectories of

38:46.080 --> 38:50.480
planets and what that does is over the course of many millions of years we can actually result in

38:50.480 --> 38:57.040
collisions between planets uh which is not good last night check so that's that's one one possibility

38:57.040 --> 39:02.400
but like let's let's be let's be honest like Mercury is useless right there's it's it's it's just

39:03.040 --> 39:07.840
baked in radiation and there's nothing of value there I mean aside from just for the sake of it

39:07.840 --> 39:12.640
being there Venus I'm not even going to speak speak to me it's interesting only from a scientific

39:12.640 --> 39:16.400
perspective in the sense that we they could maybe help us understand our climate models a bit better

39:16.400 --> 39:21.440
and what you know the potential risks are uh and what some like severe case situations are like for

39:21.440 --> 39:26.000
what an atmosphere can actually do like that's pretty scary when you look at you know what because

39:26.000 --> 39:30.000
Venus is a sister planet to our own like it's so close to us it's basically the same size as ours

39:30.000 --> 39:34.880
yet it's a complete shell and uh what's it what happened like what's the difference between us and

39:34.880 --> 39:41.280
that so yeah before we dismantle Venus I would like us to know how it came to be and actually

39:41.280 --> 39:44.880
what excitingly NASA is actually considering a couple of missions finally I think one of the most

39:44.880 --> 39:49.760
even those that are closest celestial neighbors one of the most neglected planets in the solar system

39:49.760 --> 39:54.160
yet it should be I think a high priority that we understand it a little better obviously all the

39:54.160 --> 40:00.160
focus is on Mars because it has this this this this historical potential for habitability certainly

40:00.160 --> 40:05.360
doesn't have that anymore um so that's why there's all this excitement about Mars but we also think

40:05.360 --> 40:10.240
of it as you know there's potentially you know planet B for us which again is a as I don't know

40:10.240 --> 40:14.800
if you you were you caught this one Adam but um last year I wrote a piece called why will never

40:14.800 --> 40:21.600
colonize Mars generated a lot of excitement and a lot of upset and I basically argued that Mars

40:21.600 --> 40:25.200
is not what you think it is and the whole these all these ideas of like how great it's going to be

40:25.200 --> 40:29.760
to live on Mars and colonize it and terraform and all that is a bit of a pipe dream and it's complete

40:30.160 --> 40:36.080
um uh you know um completely neglects you know the hardships and realities of doing so

40:37.120 --> 40:44.320
so so yeah um well yeah I agree this can be really hard in our current biological form

40:44.320 --> 40:50.960
but by the stage we you know um build a maybe a type two Kardashev civilization we can have the

40:50.960 --> 40:56.080
ability to sort of adapt ourselves to sort of operate in a variety of environments probably

40:56.080 --> 41:01.200
a lot more hardship than Mars for sure and I was at the long term I was a bit cheeky in my

41:01.200 --> 41:05.920
headline there when I said humans will never colonize Mars because it was my excuse to say

41:05.920 --> 41:12.880
yeah post-humans can colonize Mars so that that was kind of like where I was coming at uh on that one

41:12.880 --> 41:18.640
so uh definitely I definitely made at that point that yeah we had modified humans and that's a

41:18.640 --> 41:25.760
different story altogether so um yeah so back to the building of the Dyson sphere uh basically

41:25.760 --> 41:33.040
once you've created this core um uh panel then it becomes a sex financial thing and uh I mean

41:33.040 --> 41:37.440
Armstrong's predictions were that you could do this in maybe four stages I think five stages and it

41:37.440 --> 41:41.600
would only take you know a few decades once you went to the ball once the ball was really rolling

41:42.320 --> 41:48.720
and I mean uh I mean this idea has been attacked uh for not just because you require the dismantling

41:48.720 --> 41:54.400
of planets but also the time obviously the time scale I I agree um maybe when I wrote this article

41:54.400 --> 42:00.400
about 10 or 12 years ago I maybe overstated um our ability to get into space and work into space

42:00.400 --> 42:06.240
we're finding it to be much more difficult than we could have ever imagined and uh you know that's

42:06.240 --> 42:11.440
just the sheer cost alone of you know rockets uh delivering rockets and we're seeing this the

42:11.440 --> 42:16.320
private sector finally getting a bit of a handle on this but it's still the lot the launch requirements

42:16.320 --> 42:20.640
the technological requirements the ability to actually have machines working on mercury for

42:20.640 --> 42:26.640
example that would not you know succumb to the elements like to be fair we're still quite a ways

42:26.640 --> 42:32.000
off from being able to do this but like I like I said one thing I will stand by is that it's not

42:32.000 --> 42:36.000
too early to think about it you know let's let's let's let's talk about it let's make up some

42:36.000 --> 42:40.880
plans let's maybe make some timelines like let's maybe say hey what's the tech that we need to do

42:40.880 --> 42:45.200
this what's the material that we need to do this you know what what kind of what how would a robot

42:45.200 --> 42:49.280
actually work on mercury to kind of dig down deep into that we need to actually access them

42:49.520 --> 42:53.680
usable materials and what do we do with all the waste and all this stuff these are questions we

42:53.680 --> 42:57.440
can ask right now and get some very smart people working on even if even if it's just let's say

42:57.440 --> 43:01.600
from uh like a crowdsourced perspective obviously I think academics should be talking about this but

43:01.600 --> 43:05.760
maybe you know just as an active community so I mean obviously you've got the Mars Society and

43:05.760 --> 43:11.200
people talking about that um people it's just so devoted to colonizing Mars so why don't we have

43:11.200 --> 43:16.640
you know a group of people devoted to getting the ball rolling on the creation of a dexon

43:16.640 --> 43:24.240
swarm so uh timelines okay maybe not maybe what we what we thought but certainly I don't discount

43:24.960 --> 43:29.600
what Armstrong suggested though that once the ball is rolling though and it does become this

43:29.600 --> 43:34.320
awesome feedback process where now you can really in earnest build this thing rather quickly next thing

43:34.320 --> 43:40.480
you know you've got this you've got a dexon swarm so um one of the the way again one of the real

43:40.480 --> 43:45.360
points here in the article what and uh what Armstrong was even arguing was that again this

43:45.360 --> 43:51.520
is something that is plausible you know this is not what Dyson was conjecturing about was

43:51.520 --> 43:57.760
fascinatingly intriguingly um you know doable and you know it was it was it was just kind of blew

43:57.760 --> 44:01.200
my mind to see a guy actually put pen to paper and say here's how we can do it at least at a

44:01.200 --> 44:06.400
conceptual level that it made sense to me and I continue to think it's just a fascinating possibility

44:07.760 --> 44:13.520
oh indeed yeah so I mean in terms of the timeline to actually bootstrap to get started in this

44:13.520 --> 44:18.080
process seriously and start at least using some of the energy that we can harvest from the sun

44:18.080 --> 44:25.200
with a few uh I guess um panels in place as the beginning of a Dyson swarm how long do you think

44:25.200 --> 44:32.880
that would take? Armstrong said 40 years which is crazy but that that's what that's what that's what

44:32.880 --> 44:38.320
he said so um 40 years to get started no oh sorry I think you know the complete completion of the

44:38.320 --> 44:42.160
swarm you're asking me like when we can actually get started on the project to start building the

44:42.160 --> 44:49.920
first one yeah what's your opinion on that? Oh boy um not for a few decades I mean we're still at

44:49.920 --> 44:56.720
the stage where kind of crazy because like we're talking about like NASA's now and Congress is

44:56.720 --> 45:06.400
earnestly talking about a mission to Mars by 20 in the 2030s for example and uh the fact is that

45:06.400 --> 45:13.040
we're embarking on a really small step still like we're still not working on the moon we don't even

45:13.040 --> 45:20.720
have a moon a moon an orbital moon base we haven't even been to Mars yet um you know it and we don't

45:20.720 --> 45:25.280
know some of the uh not only do we not know the technical hurdles that await we don't know the

45:25.280 --> 45:33.840
socio-economic hurdles that await as well um our situation here on earth can start to get so dire

45:33.840 --> 45:40.800
in terms of the environment that uh deep space exploration and uh and work out there will have

45:40.800 --> 45:44.400
to take a backseat to the problems that need to be addressed here at home and it's going to be

45:44.400 --> 45:50.000
increasingly difficult for governments to justify the spending taxpayer money you know for what could

45:50.000 --> 45:55.680
be deemed as these rather uplandish uh science fictiony uh prospect I'm not saying I agree with

45:55.680 --> 46:01.520
that perspective I'm saying that will be a prevailing perspective so it's because of these

46:01.520 --> 46:07.440
kind of realities that you have to temper these kinds of expectations so to answer your question

46:07.440 --> 46:13.840
maybe not sadly maybe not for a to 100 years uh and yeah of course like I said a lot of there are a

46:13.840 --> 46:20.080
lot of wild cards and blacks wants to consider between them both ones that can continue to

46:20.080 --> 46:26.800
satisfy but even like blacks ones that could perhaps uh be good like let's say an artificial

46:27.040 --> 46:31.920
that's we kind of have this kind of like uh an artificial super intelligence that that we can

46:32.560 --> 46:38.720
kind of understand and control uh very dubious that we could do that but um let's say that we

46:38.720 --> 46:43.680
kind of like start to offload some of these design and engineering tasks to artificial intelligence

46:44.320 --> 46:50.320
uh and we find ways of let's say you know becoming more economically uh stable and having the means

46:50.320 --> 46:54.880
the resources with which to launch the source of expeditions so those things kind of came together

46:54.880 --> 46:58.640
then all that's our offer terms of when we could start to mark upon this project so that's the case

46:58.640 --> 47:04.640
I would say you know after the 2050s uh 2060s recently I will I will add though I'm turning 50

47:04.640 --> 47:11.760
this year this is just a an aside almost any irrelevant aside but turning 50 this year and

47:11.760 --> 47:15.920
you start to do the mat like when I was a kid like you'd see the oh yeah you know NASA's

47:15.920 --> 47:20.240
launching probes to this planet or this moon and it's going to take 15 years to get there or

47:20.240 --> 47:25.200
whatever it's going to be 25 year long project and you you kind of it's easy for you to digest that

47:25.200 --> 47:29.040
it's you know think a lot it's still far away in the future which you can digest it now like for

47:29.040 --> 47:34.160
example there uh that NASA's going to be sending a probe to uh to tighten it's fascinating it's

47:34.160 --> 47:38.560
going to be actually uh a drone it'll be able to fly through the atmosphere because it actually has

47:38.560 --> 47:43.920
an atmosphere and uh yeah it's going to be it'll be landing in the mid 2030s assuming they can get

47:43.920 --> 47:51.040
it going and yeah I'm going to be like I'll be like 64 65 years old when it happens and uh radical

47:51.040 --> 47:58.720
life extension Adam notwithstanding I'm hoping in terms of what you know what you know what you

47:58.720 --> 48:02.880
know what how our health can be prolonged in the future I tend to be a status cool type of a type

48:02.880 --> 48:07.520
of a person I don't tend to assume that that's going to happen um I take I assume that I'll be

48:07.520 --> 48:15.680
aging normally and I'll die you know at a depth you know as per the situation today it'd be wonderful

48:15.680 --> 48:20.720
you know I could prolong my life but it does seem that I'm starting to get to a point now in in my

48:20.720 --> 48:26.880
life where perhaps some of these longer scale uh prospects are something I'll never live to see

48:27.600 --> 48:33.360
and uh you eventually there's going to be some kind of a project where yeah if I do the math I'll be

48:33.440 --> 48:38.240
115 but it actually gets rolling in other words I probably won't be alive to see it

48:38.240 --> 48:43.200
so I'm not sure why I'm bringing this up just aside from the fact that um starting to it does

48:43.200 --> 48:47.280
affect perhaps the way you look at the future and understand that yeah you know life will absolutely

48:47.280 --> 48:52.480
go on without you being there and of course without you being there to observe it and appreciate it

48:52.480 --> 48:56.240
but of course that doesn't mean you should think it's still gonna not gonna happen most certainly

48:56.240 --> 49:00.880
you should never let that prevent you know this kind of multi-generational thinking I for example

49:00.880 --> 49:08.320
I'm a firm staunch believer that we should start to not not just talk about uh Dyson swarms

49:08.320 --> 49:15.520
in construction let's start talking about interstellar uh expeditions you know we've got Voyager

49:15.520 --> 49:20.160
the Voyager 2 probes you know they they're incredible but why don't we scale up something

49:20.160 --> 49:24.880
like that you get a massive you know I think uh they're already been like Stephen Hawking talked

49:24.880 --> 49:32.400
about this for example creating these ships with solar sails that my god like these things once they

49:32.400 --> 49:38.720
get cooking and moving in space powered only by like uh the the particles emanating out from the sun

49:38.720 --> 49:43.280
but then a short matter of time it'll be moving at 10 the speed of light you know that suddenly

49:44.160 --> 49:49.040
these relativistic speeds the the nearby star systems aren't so far away anymore and now you're

49:49.040 --> 49:54.800
talking about missions that are like what 10 40 years you know instead of like prohibitively long

49:54.800 --> 49:59.440
like like wait like Voyager's not going to reach the first possible star system for like tens of

49:59.440 --> 50:04.960
thousands like hundreds of thousands of years obviously that's super discouraging but anyways

50:04.960 --> 50:11.360
point being is I would love us to start taking the long new bold ideas yeah we may not live to

50:11.360 --> 50:16.800
see it in our own lifetime but maybe you know generations four five 10 20 from now will absolutely

50:16.800 --> 50:21.680
yield the benefits of this it could even be potentially existentially worthwhile the sense

50:21.680 --> 50:27.920
that it could actually get detect you know habitable systems uh to learn from the science of these

50:27.920 --> 50:34.400
expeditions and uh so I think we should also start thinking along those lines as well yeah the idea of

50:35.440 --> 50:41.920
astronomical waste comes to mind and population axiology or population ethics where um we should

50:41.920 --> 50:48.880
be considering the moral relevance of people who are not yet around or like slots for life that are

50:48.880 --> 50:56.960
not yet available can we say um and if we were to go extinct or to um I guess be damned to live

50:56.960 --> 51:03.120
only on this sort of film on top of this rock called earth in this tiny portion of our own

51:03.120 --> 51:10.160
galaxy let alone all the others then that would be a shame um because there's a whole lot of

51:10.160 --> 51:16.880
matter out there that doesn't isn't being sort of used to support lives worth living um and so

51:16.880 --> 51:23.280
yeah it there's a paper out there called um something along the lines of astronomical waste

51:24.480 --> 51:32.000
yeah but it's quite interesting when you start thinking about the huge sheer amount of possible

51:32.000 --> 51:39.760
lives worth living that could be cut short or just never actually be realized if we go extinct or if

51:40.720 --> 51:46.960
we just never get off earth yeah and you know bringing it back full circle to freeman dyson

51:46.960 --> 51:51.040
if he were here talking to us right now he'd be absolutely on board with what we're talking about

51:51.040 --> 51:59.840
he was actually a big thinker in terms of uh the future human trajectory and uh he you know he

51:59.840 --> 52:04.480
what did he say fair his book very famously said infinite in all directions now it's in such a

52:04.480 --> 52:10.160
beautiful beautiful term and but he believed it you know like even thought that you know eventually

52:10.160 --> 52:18.240
we could find ways of uh you know um prolonging the existence of a civilization um you know by

52:18.240 --> 52:22.560
slowing i i have to forgive me if i get this a little bit wrong but basically what he was suggesting

52:22.560 --> 52:29.280
is that uh we we dramatically slow down like the clock speed of civilization to the to the point

52:29.280 --> 52:35.920
where it's so excruciatingly slow that the time ticks relative to the actual how time is elapsing

52:35.920 --> 52:41.280
around it that it might as well be you know quasi infinite in terms of how long the civilization

52:41.280 --> 52:47.440
could actually last given the constraints of of course of cosmology uh i think he came up with

52:47.440 --> 52:56.560
these ideas back in the 70s when we saw a different view of uh cosmological evolution and development

52:56.560 --> 53:02.640
we now know for example that the universe will eventually start to expand and expand quicker

53:02.640 --> 53:07.360
and quicker and quicker which will preclude i think some of these uh ideas of you know finding

53:07.360 --> 53:11.840
almost like infinite ways of prolonging human existence or post-human existence whatever will be

53:12.480 --> 53:19.200
like 22 30 billion years from now but um yeah he was definitely online with this thinking like

53:19.200 --> 53:23.520
like think big think bigger like that's i think that's one of the more fascinating aspects about

53:23.520 --> 53:28.800
Freeman Dyson was how he would kind of like just take things to a level that perhaps you know

53:29.360 --> 53:35.280
no one uh no one had before you know when we were talking about a guy who penned this thing in 1959

53:35.920 --> 53:42.720
okay it's it's hard for us perhaps to understand how radical an idea that would be okay this is

53:42.720 --> 53:48.080
in 1959 say hey extra trust you we're gonna build what he didn't call him Dyson's spheres and people

53:48.160 --> 53:53.200
called it after that like they named it after him yes he actually didn't like the term that that

53:53.200 --> 53:58.480
was named after him but i will say he got the idea from Olaf Stapleton and that very good point

53:58.480 --> 54:03.280
actually um and thank you for bringing that up he it's not was not his idea yeah you got it from

54:03.280 --> 54:07.200
science fiction Olaf Stapleton and perhaps even others were already talking about ideas such as this

54:07.920 --> 54:13.280
again he just looked at it as a potential solution for you know the insatiable energy demands of a

54:13.280 --> 54:17.600
civilization but i thought it was pretty great like when i heard that he had died a couple of days

54:17.600 --> 54:24.400
ago i thought you know i mean i really hope that we build a Dyson swarm if not for the simple reason

54:24.400 --> 54:30.000
that we can call it a Dyson swarm or a Dyson sphere that it would what a legacy that would be as a

54:30.000 --> 54:37.040
thinker to have a megastructure you know of such magnitude be actually named after him and i think

54:37.040 --> 54:41.600
i just i would just love for that to actually happen even if he didn't like the term too bad

54:41.600 --> 54:48.880
freeman you came up with an awesome idea or at least populated popularized and more fully

54:48.880 --> 54:53.440
articulated the idea again with all due respect to Olaf Stapleton maybe i take back what i said

54:53.440 --> 54:57.760
make sure you call them stapleton swarms i don't know but but still i think we're pretty damn cool

54:57.760 --> 55:03.840
we actually do call it that we we build something like that but anyways point being that how radical

55:03.840 --> 55:08.960
must have been for him to not only just talk about megastructures but to talk about it in

55:08.960 --> 55:13.520
the context of the search for extraterrestrial intelligence which i'm not sure that was even

55:13.520 --> 55:20.560
determined existed in 1959 it wasn't until uh drake in the like what 1964 or so and project osma and

55:20.560 --> 55:26.320
the first efforts at radio set he got underway so this could predates for even radio like actual

55:26.320 --> 55:33.200
efforts for radio set city so today we can talk about amazingly we can talk about megastructures

55:33.200 --> 55:39.760
and dyson sphere uh you know without blinking an eye and batting an eye like for example um a couple

55:39.760 --> 55:46.240
years ago there was that uh variable star which is called boy a boy on star is this tabby star the

55:46.240 --> 55:52.000
same thing tabby star it's the same star it's the same thing and that had this unexplainable

55:52.000 --> 55:59.200
irregular dimming episodes and a number of you know theories were posited to explain it uh

55:59.920 --> 56:05.920
of uh in the from a natural perspective but inevitably it got people thinking well maybe

56:05.920 --> 56:11.840
this is actually evidence of uh and the first data point we have of an alien megastructure

56:11.840 --> 56:16.800
and what delighted me as a journalist covering this stuff well was that i could actually just you

56:16.800 --> 56:20.160
know matter of fact we say yeah could this could actually this is actually being entertaining as

56:20.160 --> 56:25.360
possible and i didn't have to like like really beat people over the head to understand it and i

56:25.360 --> 56:28.320
and appreciate it like people like oh i know i've heard of that i don't have a nice enchilas you

56:28.320 --> 56:31.920
know or whether it'd be through the science fiction or whether just through casual conversations

56:31.920 --> 56:38.480
becoming whereas we had to fight for dysonian city you know just tended to 15 years ago it's now

56:38.480 --> 56:42.960
almost taken for granted that that's how we should look for extra trust with civilizations that and

56:42.960 --> 56:47.200
now almost the the radio study almost seems anachronistic i still believe we should we should

56:47.200 --> 56:51.680
do it don't get me wrong i still think we should listen to radio signals but now yeah let's let's

56:51.680 --> 56:57.360
look for uh like i said other techno signatures even laser settings becoming a thing and all that so

56:57.360 --> 57:03.120
um again but again um i just find it interesting that uh freeman dyson being the free thinker

57:03.120 --> 57:08.160
that he was you know just had it you know just thought this is what needs to be said and thought

57:08.160 --> 57:17.040
through and you know and not like i say is what it is i've often thought about like what others

57:17.040 --> 57:27.520
like strong attractors could um i guess motivate a civilization to uh expand in a way which is

57:27.520 --> 57:33.440
indetectable um and you know at least molin came out with the idea that like maybe black holes

57:34.000 --> 57:39.440
born universes and and there's other sort of permutations and an idea and and perhaps

57:40.160 --> 57:47.760
uh galactic civilizations engineer or optimize black holes to spew forth the types of idealized

57:47.760 --> 57:56.320
universes for computation and and and life right um and they think that you know they sort of ascend

57:56.320 --> 58:03.840
or transcend in some way to to a better reality or a reality more conducive towards flourishing

58:04.480 --> 58:09.200
i kind of hope that that's possible and that's a good reason why we can't see

58:09.760 --> 58:16.960
other civilizations out there but what are your thoughts on um i guess strategies for

58:16.960 --> 58:24.960
civilizations to continue without being detected so again i have to work under the um the data

58:24.960 --> 58:31.440
that we have right now which does suggest that advanced civilizations should they exist they

58:31.440 --> 58:38.000
don't become interstellar colonists that just that's that's the assumption that i'm working under

58:38.640 --> 58:44.800
so i'm a bit i guess i can call me like a contact pessimist or even like a you know

58:45.520 --> 58:51.520
just you just doubt that's kind of like within our within our future uh future means so i keep

58:51.520 --> 58:56.240
asking the question well how the why then what is this kind of modality that a civilization

58:56.240 --> 59:03.120
would enter into that's that's that's still uh deemed of value and uh it just it mean it just

59:03.120 --> 59:10.800
keeps coming back to this idea of uh of you know this internal existence that living within ourselves

59:10.800 --> 59:17.360
like locally and not branching out like just finding uh you know means to uh you know perpetually have

59:17.360 --> 59:23.360
access to resources that might mean star hopping or parking near a perpetual energy source of some

59:23.360 --> 59:28.960
sort um but living more modestly in that sense and yeah just running you know ancestor civilizations

59:28.960 --> 59:35.360
or hedonistic civilizations and living out you know the the the remaining duration of the cosmos

59:35.360 --> 59:39.520
in in that manner that's kind of like the best solution that i can come up at this point that's

59:39.520 --> 59:46.080
still that that in my opinion uh does not violate the uh the non-exclusivity issue and at the same

59:46.080 --> 59:51.360
time um answers the question as to why we've not made contact with anybody else that maybe we're

59:51.360 --> 59:56.640
all just inherently xenophobic and we just keep to ourselves we enter into this uh happy heaven

59:56.640 --> 01:00:02.800
like modality and that's that's and then in that post-unit of happily ever after the end so

01:00:02.800 --> 01:00:06.480
i'm not suggesting for a second that that's what will happen or that's the greatest solution to

01:00:06.480 --> 01:00:12.720
this but it's certainly one that uh occupies some of my thought uh in terms of um what's the solution

01:00:12.720 --> 01:00:19.680
here what's the what's actually going to happen what's a non-exclusivity issue it means that um

01:00:19.680 --> 01:00:24.080
it has to be a solution that every single extraterrestrial civilization will independently

01:00:24.080 --> 01:00:29.200
uh enter into and that there can't be any outliers because if there were outliers and we would have

01:00:29.760 --> 01:00:35.280
made contact with them by now they would have made their presence known that's again

01:00:35.280 --> 01:00:40.720
working under those kinds of uh constraints i suppose in terms of uh when used to kind of

01:00:40.720 --> 01:00:47.200
make these sorts of uh extrapolations i guess freeman dyson did have some controversial opinions

01:00:47.200 --> 01:00:54.800
and views um and one of them was uh that he was sort of critical of climate change models or that

01:00:55.680 --> 01:01:04.640
whether climate change would have a serious impact on global health and viability yeah he

01:01:04.640 --> 01:01:09.680
kind of alienated a lot of people toward the end of his life and um yeah he was not kind of on board

01:01:09.680 --> 01:01:15.360
the whole um you know climate justice span wagon and quite the opposite and uh you know

01:01:16.240 --> 01:01:20.720
he he said himself that you know to be a good scientist kind of like means you have to be

01:01:20.720 --> 01:01:25.360
subversive i don't think you ever liked i think the more popular an idea you know became i think

01:01:25.360 --> 01:01:30.160
the less inclined it was to latch on to it kind of i was looking for ways to kind of chip away at it

01:01:30.880 --> 01:01:37.280
and climate change was certainly um one of those targets and uh yeah he kind of thought that

01:01:37.280 --> 01:01:44.160
scientists were i think it was a bit of a climate change skeptic first of all um but even if you did

01:01:44.160 --> 01:01:50.640
buy into the models he kind of thought well it's not so bad you know which from today's perspective

01:01:50.640 --> 01:01:54.560
like i don't have to tell you as a someone who lives in australia like well it is kind of bad

01:01:54.560 --> 01:02:00.240
i think it's kind of like it's a show you know it's just awful and uh like because he was saying

01:02:00.240 --> 01:02:04.880
oh it's great that carbon dioxide is great for plants and you know create these lush environments

01:02:04.880 --> 01:02:10.960
and um all these kinds of like this i think the hand way these sort of um you know proclamations

01:02:10.960 --> 01:02:15.440
that it got me thinking well he's a he's a big thinker but he was also maybe sometimes spoke

01:02:15.440 --> 01:02:20.080
outside of his immediate area of expertise and maybe didn't think through some of the repercussions

01:02:21.200 --> 01:02:28.400
of this yeah i will say at the same time he's like the only climate skeptic or whatever you

01:02:28.400 --> 01:02:34.080
want to call it actually i kind of he'll ring in my ear every once in a while you know like

01:02:34.080 --> 01:02:39.120
you for example you'll study like Jurassic environments and you understand that you know

01:02:39.120 --> 01:02:44.240
there was no polar caps at that time and the dinosaurs lived at a very unique time in our

01:02:45.360 --> 01:02:50.400
interplanets history and understand that yeah we're the climate change is an indelible part of

01:02:50.400 --> 01:02:55.840
this planet's history like the planet in fact the history of this planet is simply the history of

01:02:55.840 --> 01:03:01.520
climate change and in this constant study of how the planet has changed and how animals have reacted

01:03:01.520 --> 01:03:06.240
to this to climate change over time and that includes all kinds of different things um hominins

01:03:06.240 --> 01:03:11.440
and uh of course dinosaurs and animals and all sorts of things so um you know you do have to

01:03:11.440 --> 01:03:16.960
look at climate change that that lens yeah what's i don't have to remind you or your listeners

01:03:16.960 --> 01:03:21.920
obviously this is characteristically different because we're the ones that are now responsible

01:03:21.920 --> 01:03:27.520
for it and we're kind of uh causing this change on timescales that are unprecedented in the planet's

01:03:27.520 --> 01:03:33.200
history like it's uh these spikes are just unreal in terms of how quickly uh we're able to now impact

01:03:33.200 --> 01:03:39.440
upon uh the environment you know it also gets me i'm thinking even about kardashev's scale because

01:03:39.440 --> 01:03:44.560
kardashev says talks about k-1 civilizations and you know harnessing of the entire uh energy

01:03:44.560 --> 01:03:50.400
output of the planet one thing kardashev would not have been concerned about well at what cost

01:03:50.400 --> 01:03:56.160
to the environment what does that mean in terms of the heat expenditure uh you know uh if a whole

01:03:56.160 --> 01:04:01.840
planet you know is working in that way like what is what is that doing environmentally what is it

01:04:01.840 --> 01:04:07.280
doing to sustainability is it viable sustainable is this you know is it actually creating a planet

01:04:07.280 --> 01:04:14.720
that's actually going to be able to continue to move forward in time and uh uh and and still sustain

01:04:14.720 --> 01:04:20.320
you know what what we would value in terms of wildlife and uh and plant life and all that sort of

01:04:20.320 --> 01:04:25.440
stuff so um it's one thing to conjecture about is one of the things sometimes one of the most

01:04:25.440 --> 01:04:29.920
difficult things is to project outcomes and consequences and i think maybe that's where

01:04:29.920 --> 01:04:35.440
freeman dyson was maybe a little lacking and and i could do cavalier perhaps about what he thought

01:04:35.440 --> 01:04:41.120
were the ill effects of climate change and and not to accuse him of this but maybe simply because

01:04:41.120 --> 01:04:47.680
it was at the sake of being contrary and being that that that guy who was that um you know to be

01:04:47.680 --> 01:04:52.960
that kind of deviant when it came to scientific uh to scientific thinking so that sadly will

01:04:52.960 --> 01:04:59.760
probably be one one area in which he will not be fondly uh remembered as uh i think

01:05:00.480 --> 01:05:03.600
we can pretty much agree that uh climate change is something that needs to be

01:05:04.240 --> 01:05:13.120
mitigated rather than celebrated right but um yes so a lot of people have controversial opinions

01:05:13.120 --> 01:05:19.120
and it shouldn't really detract from the value they contribute in other areas um and i think

01:05:19.120 --> 01:05:25.200
some people like to demonize thinkers because they come up with one controversial opinion

01:05:26.160 --> 01:05:31.360
and that can kind of be like throwing the baby out with the bathwater which is i think silly

01:05:31.360 --> 01:05:39.440
yeah yeah no no for sure i mean uh i you know i have you know so many quote unquote heroes that

01:05:39.440 --> 01:05:44.960
that i admire but i don't think there's a i would never say like the reason why i had to put heroes

01:05:44.960 --> 01:05:50.080
in scare quotes is because you know whether it be carl saying it or freeman dyson or anyone of

01:05:50.080 --> 01:05:53.680
these people that i hugely admire they're not perfect and there's always something about their

01:05:53.680 --> 01:05:58.160
personality or something they might have done or something that they believe in that there's

01:05:58.160 --> 01:06:04.960
absolutely not you know conform to my own beliefs or values so i i would never say that i would i

01:06:04.960 --> 01:06:10.480
will unabashedly feel and irreservedly follow someone and declare them you know to be the

01:06:10.480 --> 01:06:16.480
perfect hero for me that that does not exist for for me personally so i could admire the

01:06:16.480 --> 01:06:20.640
hell out of somebody that doesn't mean i have to buy an absolutely everything that they have to say

01:06:20.640 --> 01:06:26.880
so i kind of yeah totally agree with you yeah yeah is there any other points which you'd like to

01:06:26.880 --> 01:06:34.480
bring up at this stage which we haven't yet covered um uh you know we we boy we we covered a lot there

01:06:34.480 --> 01:06:39.280
i just want to just uh maybe back to tabby star just to say that it's not it i don't know we've

01:06:39.280 --> 01:06:44.560
kind of came full circle on that it's not a megastructure um right now they're pretty sure it's

01:06:44.560 --> 01:06:49.440
still uh uh some kind of naturalistic phenomenon and it was a fascinating paper a few months ago

01:06:49.440 --> 01:06:56.960
suggested that what it might actually be is a disintegrating moon so what what happens in some

01:06:56.960 --> 01:07:03.920
star systems is that uh a planet uh will at the end of its life get subsumed by its host star

01:07:03.920 --> 01:07:09.040
and it'll bring along its moon or moons with it in this case they're saying that that did not

01:07:09.040 --> 01:07:17.200
happen that the moon got ejected and it's slowly disintegrating um as it is also being a subsumed

01:07:17.200 --> 01:07:24.960
by the star it's kind of creating this anomalous debris field that uh is uh uh that is infrequent in

01:07:24.960 --> 01:07:29.840
terms of uh how it's happening and that's the explanation and i actually talked to dr boyan

01:07:29.840 --> 01:07:35.600
about this and she thought it was an intriguing possibility so um i decided to mention that

01:07:35.600 --> 01:07:38.640
because i didn't want your listeners to think that it was still people are still very much thinking

01:07:38.640 --> 01:07:45.040
that it's a megastructure it's we're pretty sure it's not but i think it's pretty exciting um that

01:07:45.040 --> 01:07:50.000
we can talk about this possibility yet at the same time you never want to you know whenever we

01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:54.960
see something that you don't understand is put your hands and say oh my god we don't understand it

01:07:54.960 --> 01:07:59.840
it's gotta be aliens like i think that's i'm not suggesting we should do that by no means in fact

01:07:59.840 --> 01:08:06.480
we're talking about pulsars earlier the first pulsars that were discovered were so odd to

01:08:06.480 --> 01:08:10.800
astronomers they had no explanation for them because these things are blinking with such

01:08:10.800 --> 01:08:14.640
extreme rapidity and regularity like that was their first thought too and i think they're actually

01:08:14.640 --> 01:08:20.240
in the notes they're like was like lg uh lg m's they called them or something like that which meant

01:08:20.240 --> 01:08:23.280
like little green man or something like that basically hinting that oh my god we're maybe

01:08:23.280 --> 01:08:27.600
discovered you know some kind of alien signature here it turned out not to be the case but there

01:08:27.600 --> 01:08:33.200
always is this tendency that when we do see something that's super weird and it defies our

01:08:33.200 --> 01:08:38.240
expectations there is this tendency to invoke extraterrestrial life i'm not saying that's

01:08:38.240 --> 01:08:43.520
the healthiest thing to do it should be this kind of last resort if you will kind of like that

01:08:43.520 --> 01:08:47.840
like the anecdote at the end of an anecdote to say after we've exhausted all these possibilities

01:08:47.840 --> 01:08:53.440
you know a through f let's just maybe keep an open mind that it kind of maybe is consistent with what

01:08:53.440 --> 01:08:59.520
we think is technosignature could look like it's that's all i want to say about tabby star um at

01:08:59.520 --> 01:09:08.800
this point awesome well um i guess if you'd like to conclude what if you were to meet somebody

01:09:09.360 --> 01:09:17.120
who was thinking about donating their large fortune towards some form of exploratory research

01:09:17.920 --> 01:09:21.760
what would it be and how would you convince them to do something that you value

01:09:21.760 --> 01:09:27.680
that maybe relates to our discussion today wow that's that's a heck of a question i never

01:09:27.840 --> 01:09:33.120
really given not really giving so much thought to that like i will say that it might be an answer

01:09:33.120 --> 01:09:38.480
that um it's kind of like unsexy uh relative to discussion or even irrelevant to the

01:09:38.480 --> 01:09:43.120
discussions we just had but i admire for example the bill and blend the gates foundation for what

01:09:43.120 --> 01:09:48.240
they've done in terms of being smart about where they spend their money and in particular as to

01:09:48.800 --> 01:09:54.480
what they deem to be areas that are most in need and for example a big thing for them is

01:09:55.360 --> 01:10:01.040
neglect the tropical diseases and uh obviously you know with the COVID-19 being what it is right

01:10:01.040 --> 01:10:07.040
now that's not a neglect the tropical disease obviously but it just shows that we are still

01:10:08.720 --> 01:10:15.600
victimized by microorganisms like in a way like that's just unreal you know we we like to think

01:10:15.600 --> 01:10:20.640
that we have a handle on on nature that we don't we're not preyed upon by lions anymore you know

01:10:20.640 --> 01:10:25.760
or wolves um but we're most certainly preyed upon by other kinds of animals and they're

01:10:25.760 --> 01:10:33.120
microscopic in size whether it be malaria you know zika virus um you know the common flu

01:10:33.120 --> 01:10:39.760
and the cold and now the COVID-19 uh disease it's uh i think that we need we need to continue to

01:10:39.760 --> 01:10:43.520
spend our money and our resources on those kinds of threats because at the end of the day and at

01:10:43.520 --> 01:10:47.760
the end of the year when you look at the uh you know the actuarial tables those are the things that

01:10:47.760 --> 01:10:53.840
are killing us uh you know at a horrific scale you know that's what's killing us on mass and we

01:10:53.840 --> 01:11:00.320
need to get a handle on that and similarly the back out include bacteria and bacterial infections in

01:11:00.320 --> 01:11:05.280
that in that uh the body of thinking and we're heading toward the so-called you know antibiotic

01:11:05.280 --> 01:11:08.880
apocalypse where there are antibiotics looks like they're not they're increasingly becoming

01:11:08.880 --> 01:11:13.680
ineffective and we're starting to talk about you know super viruses that are even super immune to

01:11:14.640 --> 01:11:19.520
um standard uh cocktails of antibiotics so these are the kinds of things that scare the crap out of

01:11:19.520 --> 01:11:26.080
me and me too and it should scare your listeners as well and so yeah that's if i'm okay you know

01:11:26.080 --> 01:11:31.840
i think that people with horrendous amounts of money should probably spend it to alleviate those

01:11:31.840 --> 01:11:40.880
kinds of uh blights so that's how i will answer that well george it's been an amazing mind blowing

01:11:40.880 --> 01:11:46.000
discussion i i love talking about these topics and i really appreciate the time here that was fun

01:11:46.000 --> 01:11:51.040
to talk to the review so yeah thanks heaps and i look forward to chatting with you again in the

01:11:51.040 --> 01:12:04.720
future absolutely me too

01:12:10.880 --> 01:12:11.760
you
