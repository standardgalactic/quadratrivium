Checking Science, Technology & the Future/How To Build A Dyson Sphere in 5 Steps - George Dvorsky.txt
1. **Pulsars and Extraterrestrial Life**: The discussion began with a reflection on the initial confusion astronomers faced when they first discovered pulsarsâ€”intensely regular blinking sources of radio waves that were initially thought to be of extraterrestrial origin, before being understood as highly magnetized neutron stars.

2. **Tabby Cat Star**: The conversation moved on to discuss the Tabby Cat Star (KIC 846285), an object observed by the Kepler space telescope that exhibits an unusual light curve suggesting possible alien megastructures. However, it's important to consider all scientific possibilities before invoking aliens as an explanation.

3. **Exploratory Research Investment**: If someone with a large fortune was considering donating towards research, George recommends focusing on neglected tropical diseases and the growing threat of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. He emphasizes that these are immediate threats to human health, much like viruses such as malaria, Zika, the common flu, and COVID-19, and that it's crucial to address these issues before they become even more dire.

4. **Final Thoughts**: The discussion highlighted the importance of scientific inquiry, the potential for misunderstanding rare and unusual astronomical phenomena as extraterrestrial signals, and the ongoing challenges posed by infectious diseases and antibiotic resistance. It underscored the value of investing in research that addresses immediate threats to humanity.

5. **Future Engagement**: Both George and the host expressed their enjoyment of the conversation and the topic's relevance, indicating a desire for future discussions on similar intriguing subjects.

Checking Science, Technology & the Future/Keith Wiley - Mind Uploading & Whole Brain Emulation.txt
 In this conversation, Keith Wiley discusses the concept of whole brain emulation (WBE) and its potential future realization. He believes that WBE will likely be achieved before the end of the century, but he is unsure if it will be within his own lifetime or just beyond it. He emphasizes that the next generations will grow up with increasingly sophisticated AI, which may make the transition to a world where WBE is commonplace seem natural to them.

Keith acknowledges that the preservation of the human brain as a technology is still in its infancy and faces significant technical and regulatory hurdles before it becomes a mainstream procedure. He expresses a tempered optimism about the future of this field, noting that even if he doesn't personally experience WBE, he finds it exciting that humans are exploring such frontiers.

He also mentions his interest in science fiction literature that explores mind uploading and WBE, highlighting works by Greg Egan, Arthur C. Clarke, and Richard K. Morgan, among others. These stories provide insights into the possibilities and implications of such technologies.

Finally, Keith hints at a forthcoming book he is working on titled "Contemplating Oblivion," which will delve deeper into these topics, and he looks forward to discussing it in greater detail in a future conversation.
