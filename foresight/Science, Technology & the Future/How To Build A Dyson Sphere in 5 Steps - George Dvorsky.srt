00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,280
Hey everybody, let's build a Dyson Sphere. We know we want to, humanity yearns for the

2
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:10,000
cosmic climb, so where do we start? Welcome to science technology in the future. Today

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:15,200
we have Canadian futurist, science writer and ethicist George Svorsky with us. He wrote

4
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:20,400
an interesting piece on how to build a Dyson Sphere in five easy steps. So we are here to

5
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:26,800
discuss the hows, what's, wins and where's of doing so. George Svorsky has appeared many

6
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:31,440
times in our show since 2012 discussing journalism, human enhancement, singularity,

7
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:37,440
the Turing test and the AlphaGo phenomenon. He is a contributing editor at Gizmodo and IO9,

8
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:42,240
the chairman of the board at the Institute for Ethics and Emerging Technologies and it's one

9
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:47,920
of the directors for the rights of non-human persons program. Hey thank you so much. It's sad

10
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:53,680
that we're here to discuss the passing of an iconic figure but it certainly gives us a good

11
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:58,480
opportunity to delve into some of the issues that he raised over the course of his illustrious

12
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:04,080
career and at times a controversial career and we'll dive in and explore some of these pretty

13
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:10,800
exciting concepts. So the way that I was really introduced to the idea of Freeman Dyson was

14
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:16,720
actually through Dyson Spheres, my interest in large galactic mega-scale structures. First of all,

15
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:24,960
I mean what is a Dyson sphere and why would we want to build one? Yeah I mean the whole,

16
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:32,080
I mean the whole thing got started for Dyson back in the late the late 50s. I think you penned

17
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:37,920
this two, just a two-page essay where you just kind of got thinking that you know eventually

18
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:43,680
you know like a super sophisticated, super powerful technological civilization

19
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:50,160
they're going to need a lot more energy than what's you know what could possibly be provided on

20
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:56,320
their home planet. So he conjectured about these hypothetical megastructures which are basically

21
00:01:56,320 --> 00:02:06,640
these under a massive array of solar panels that will completely envelop the sun and extract

22
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:15,520
virtually all the energy that's output from the from the star. And yeah I think he had originally

23
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:24,000
envisioned it as a whole fleet of satellites like a spacecraft in orbit around the sun

24
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:31,680
but out of tremendous like like I would think like hundreds of kilometers of density so they

25
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:34,960
would not you know they would not intersect in this fashion to each other but effectively

26
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:40,880
it would kind of from a distant observer there'd be so many and so many working in concert that

27
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:48,320
would effectively like be this swarm of spacecraft or really what are solar panels in orbit like I

28
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:53,040
said around the sun extracting that energy and that energy could therefore be used to to power that

29
00:02:53,040 --> 00:03:00,000
civilization and they could continue to advance and you know develop as an advanced civilization.

30
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:06,000
And he also got thinking well if this is a possibility for extraterrestrials well two

31
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:10,480
things come from that one he said well it therefore represents a way for us to potentially detect

32
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:15,040
the signs of extraterrestrial civilization so that thus becomes a kind of techno signature

33
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:21,840
and indeed this this obviously this this giant shield that kind of you know envelops the sun

34
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:27,200
is going to be absorbing a tremendous amount of heat it will then be giving off a certain amount

35
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:32,160
of heat radiation so he said that and others have since speculated that we should be able to

36
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:37,120
detect this infrared signature at specific bands from Earth but that'll that'll depend on the

37
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:43,680
materials that are used and the amount of heat that still is able to be dissipated from the structure

38
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:51,200
and yeah I mean and then the other the other the second issue that this raises is that well hey

39
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:54,560
that means that's something that we might do in the future as well so this is not something exclusive

40
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:59,040
for extraterrestrials it's something that future humans might want to build as well

41
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:06,320
and yeah I mean it's pretty exciting as an idea I think it's a no-brainer I'm not

42
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:12,000
that's funny because I'm such a huge advocate of solar power as a renewable like I yeah I like

43
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:17,920
wind of course and I make some renewables but oh my god like for me like a solar is a no-brainer

44
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:22,560
I have this envision like from transformers like Cybertron but instead of kind of creating

45
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:27,040
Cybertron why don't we just convert Earth into this gigantic solar you know like basically a

46
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:32,880
gigantic orb that's plastered in solar arrays right yeah I exaggerate but but the point is that we

47
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:39,200
are absolutely squandering so much real estate on this planet that should be extracting solar

48
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:46,640
you know solar energy that's otherwise going to waste of course you know we don't want to

49
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:51,200
destroy it for us and things like that obviously plant life and other life need this well there's

50
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:57,280
a lot of death it's isn't there yeah there's a lot of rooftops unit I mean those two things right

51
00:04:57,280 --> 00:05:02,640
there I mean we could just exploit those resources in terms of real estate we go a long way I think

52
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:08,080
to providing some of the much needed power so but what Dyson was thinking about back in 1959

53
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:13,200
again he was thinking that eventually though you know this will be unsatisfactory even if we

54
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:19,040
can't harness as much as much energy as we can on the planet and what would be what would what

55
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:23,760
was since we would be referred to as like a Kardashian one civilization but perhaps I'm jumping

56
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:26,880
ahead of ourselves as we will get to Kardashian stuff in just a minute but it's nice that these

57
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:32,080
ideas intersect with each other that a Kardashian one scale civilization would harness the entire

58
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:36,880
energy available to it on this host planet where it would therefore need to graduate to a Kardashian

59
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:40,640
two scale civilization where it can actually harness all of the available output from its host

60
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:46,080
star and that's where Dyson Spirit provided the Dyson provided a mechanism a potential mega

61
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:51,680
structure with which this could conceivably actually happen so it's kind of obviously

62
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:56,560
futurists get excited by this idea because it really does present a plausible solution for our

63
00:05:57,200 --> 00:06:01,840
energy needs moving forward whatever those energy for whatever we want to you know convert that

64
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:08,400
energy into in future whether we're running supercomputers or you know the like so so yeah

65
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:11,600
that's that's that's kind of maybe that's the answer your question yeah that's kind of like

66
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:16,080
what this what we haven't even got into all the different kinds of Dyson structures that

67
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:21,040
can exist but that basically is you know how I'd answer your question as to why and how

68
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:29,040
we're not how and why we want to build such a thing indeed yes um yeah so uh so two luminaries

69
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:36,080
two amazing minds recently passed away Freeman Dyson and Nikolai Kardashev no I'm not talking

70
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:42,720
about the Kardashians folks in case you haven't heard of like the Nikolai Kardashev here's a guy

71
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:49,120
who came up with civilizations the scales of civilization and and what sort of resources

72
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:55,440
they'd be using and how large they'd be and so yeah there's a there's three Kardashev scales do you

73
00:06:55,440 --> 00:07:01,360
want to give us a brief yeah yeah sure and again very much a contemporary not the Kardashev scale

74
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:06,400
yeah the Kardashian scale is coming completely different we'll save that for another podcast

75
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:13,760
yeah so Freeman Dyson and Nikolai Kardashev obviously contemporaries so whereas Freeman Dyson

76
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:20,960
was running with Dyson Spears in 1959 I believe it was Kardashev in 1966 conceived of the Kardashev

77
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:30,640
scale and again it was a very simple scale uh one to three and you know he was to him like this

78
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:37,920
this way he was a soviet astrophysicist and to him you know energy availability was a

79
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:43,440
massive metric like it meant everything in terms of how you would you know really define a stage of

80
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:50,480
civilization and he got this idea well eventually you know a civilization should be able to harness

81
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:55,840
all the you know all the energy that it can possibly extract just on its home planet and that can be

82
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:59,760
you know obviously just we're just talking about solar so that can be incoming solar but can be

83
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:03,840
anything else it can be wind it can be currents and all that but eventually that's there's only so

84
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:10,320
much you can extract once you've kind of hit that cap you're what he would call a Kardashev one scale

85
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:16,640
civilization and the next was a civilization that can then harness the entire energy output of its

86
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:23,520
sun that's a Kardashev two scale and perhaps more radically I don't want to say more speculative

87
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:29,600
because all of this is speculative but more radically he also conjectured about a type three

88
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:35,200
Kardashev scale civilization which can harness the entire energy output of the host galaxy

89
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:40,720
which when you think about how many millions billions of stars are in the Milky Way that's a

90
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:45,840
lot of energy that's a you know mix of wonder you know at that point you know that that that

91
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:49,920
point is beyond human comprehension to understand what that civilization would be like and what

92
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:54,000
they could possibly use that much energy for it gets in it is kind of maybe like godlike

93
00:08:55,040 --> 00:09:01,680
the state of being that again it's difficult to to imagine so oh man I looked at some of these

94
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:07,680
numbers and look it's hard to make intuitive sense oh I know they're just so ridiculously yeah the

95
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:13,280
exponentials are massive and yeah like the orders of magnitude beyond orders of magnitude beyond

96
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:17,280
orders of magnitude it's because the point where it doesn't the numbers that you suggest that

97
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:23,360
of them they just don't mean and it just doesn't make any more sense to us I think even like to

98
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:28,800
think about a Kardashev one scale civilization is still enough to kind of make my to make me real

99
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:33,200
in terms of what that would actually represent let alone you know a Dyson sphere capable civilization

100
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:38,880
and I mean since I mean that's a great scale and it got a lot of conversation going on the

101
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:43,040
late great Carl Sagan uh loved the idea and he thought hey why don't we actually kind of dive

102
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:47,840
into this a little bit break it down a little bit kind of came up with a schema for you know

103
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:53,280
creating incremental versions of Kardashev scale so according to his measure so for example today

104
00:09:53,280 --> 00:10:00,800
earth and earth today human civilization would be about a 0.7 like a 0.75 on the scale so we're

105
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:05,680
gonna like we're like three quarters of the way there to be a full k1 civilization and similarly

106
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:11,120
they get out like 1.2 1.5 or whatever you know obviously if you're working from a Kardashev

107
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:17,520
two to three you could be a Kardashev you know 2.0000006 you probably that's a ridiculous you

108
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:23,440
know because you may be at that point in part is let's say 10% of the uh the Milky Way so these

109
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:29,040
kind of make sense and but even others are taking inspiration from uh Kardashev and come up with

110
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:35,280
other ideas you know for example the amount of space let's say that a civilization has uh as occupied

111
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:40,240
so let's say if it's now kind of dominates its entire solar its entire star system well that's

112
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:44,400
could be a certain level or the amount of infer this is not one that I'm particularly partial to

113
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:53,840
and I believe Carl Sagan also promoted this idea was that it was the amount of information available

114
00:10:53,840 --> 00:11:00,880
to a civilization and I believe you kind of did this across the scale of A to Z so you could have

115
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:06,960
whereas A is like hardly any you know level of information and set as like I forget the way

116
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:12,240
what it was the the actual metric that he used but it was that that was like the end of the scale

117
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:16,160
so I believe he said that we were like at an H level so we were like we're like a Kardashev

118
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:22,640
so we were like we're like at a 0.75 H type civilization right now in terms of like not the

119
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:26,800
energy that we have available to ourselves and the amount of information processing that we're

120
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:32,000
capable of uh of engaging in and I think that those two things there are I think a very potent

121
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:36,000
measures you know where you're at there's of course it doesn't measure things like you know

122
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:40,080
gross domestic product that doesn't measure things like you know social well-being and

123
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:44,880
health factors um and I mean there's so many different ways I think you could still drill

124
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:51,600
down and come up with different ways of describing like the technological or social or political or

125
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:58,640
whatever aspect is important too in terms of the development of a civilization whether it be

126
00:11:58,640 --> 00:12:02,320
ourselves whether it be an extraterrestrial level civilization and I think we'll always be biased

127
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:08,160
but what we think is a good metric of progress um you know so you know who knows maybe in a

128
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:13,520
hundred years from now we'll have a completely different sense as to what the direction and

129
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:18,960
the developmental trajectory that we would be desirable for uh an advancing uh civilization

130
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:23,360
such as our own and you know you can't speak to what that what that might actually be and maybe

131
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:29,920
if you look at for example maybe it could be the amount of um you know renewable uh energy

132
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:35,200
available to a civilization outside of uh non-renewables that'd be a good one I'd be

133
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:41,040
fascinated to see that you know that scale put you know put aside to that or if you were partial

134
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:46,800
to things like you know the hedonistic imperative uh or you know shadow engineering you know maybe

135
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:53,200
how far are we to toward that goal like and how many and how many individuals both human

136
00:12:53,200 --> 00:13:00,160
and non-human animal on the planet are in a kind of uh entering into a state of uh of

137
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:06,160
hedonism as opposed to the kind of uh modality that we find ourselves in uh today so different

138
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:10,080
there's different ways on all this then you know that's Kardashian but that kind of got us thinking

139
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:16,400
about you know um the ways in which we can um you know conceive about uh you know how we describe

140
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:23,040
the state of a civilization yeah indeed yeah I should uh preface that I am partial to the hedonistic

141
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:28,480
imperative I've done a lot of interviews with David um although I don't think to me I just

142
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:34,160
I'm not quite ready to commit to pleasure being the only metric that's important I think uh

143
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:41,360
sensitivity to novelty is also very important and uh yeah um and the ability to to make progress

144
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:51,040
intelligence and um yeah so yeah wow it's it's it's amazing how large theoretically civilizations

145
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:57,600
could get um but it's been conjectured and I'm also a little bit worried that we can't see any

146
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:03,760
evidence of other civilizations doing this yeah and hence this this ties into the Fermi Paradox

147
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:10,160
right no Drake equation absolutely I mean first and foremost um we can almost write off Kardashian

148
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:16,480
three as a possibility because you know our our astronomical observations uh seem to be in violation

149
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:23,440
of that that idea you know we look up into the sky and uh we see no evidence of uh of you know

150
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:30,400
galaxies that have been completely uh re-engineered or in or away somehow obscured

151
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:37,840
um by um you know this massive use of uh of like Dysonian type megastructures and there have been

152
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:42,800
actually this is actually not something I just you know I'm not just idly saying this to you

153
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:50,560
there have actually been specific um astronomical observations looking for um these sorts of signatures

154
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:56,880
coming from other galaxies and obviously these studies aren't to be all an end all you know maybe

155
00:14:56,880 --> 00:15:02,720
other ways of searching for these cloaked galaxies that are out there but we have yet to kind of see

156
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:07,680
such a thing so right off the bat it's like oh I don't know I mean I also think just I mean

157
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:12,720
it's kind of like you suggested it does bring the Fermi Paradox to mind because maybe we should

158
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:17,280
be seeing these like even if we are looking potentially you know hundreds of millions

159
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:22,160
or billions of light years away because obviously we're looking deep deep deep back into time

160
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:27,040
you know like we have for example special lens that could show us the universe or the cosmos

161
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:32,880
outside of the Hubble bubble that we're in maybe it would be a dark universe and maybe

162
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:39,040
that we're at a special a special time in our universe's development where galaxies are you know

163
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:47,120
starting to become subsumed by the intelligences which they've given birth to but more locally

164
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:53,040
to the Milky Way again the searches have only begun like we've only been talking about Dysonian

165
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:59,120
SETI for I'd say but the last 10 or 15 years and again the term Dysonian SETI again we can

166
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:03,360
that's a tip of the hat to Freeman Dyson so again thank you for for that and

167
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:12,080
with that the idea behind Dysonian SETI is in addition to looking for traces of Dyson spheres

168
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:18,640
or shovels or swarms or whatever we should be looking for any kind of techno artifact and in

169
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:25,600
particular mega-scale engineering because there could be many different kinds of things that advanced

170
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:29,760
extraterrestrial civilizations would do that would leave some kind of a signature for us to

171
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:36,400
be able to detect it could be everything from pollution and heat waste you know and back to

172
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:41,440
pollution like for example even planets that are of an unnaturally high level of carbon dioxide or

173
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:45,600
have been other kind of chemical compounds that are not consistent with what we know about the

174
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:49,920
known laws of physics in terms of what can autonomously be generated through natural processes

175
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:57,360
it could be traces of s you know engines or the rearranging of stars or again or even just very

176
00:16:57,360 --> 00:17:04,240
straightforwardly a you know a Dyson shell itself as we were alluding to earlier and even

177
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:08,560
what's also fascinating is that there's constantly you know new thinking in terms of where we should

178
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:14,960
be looking so recent papers said hey you know what like never mind like plain old stars like

179
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:19,920
we should be looking at pulsars for Dyson instructors that what they will do is that

180
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:26,080
that makes more sense to create what's like a Dyson like a Dyson ring is really what it would be

181
00:17:26,080 --> 00:17:30,480
so just you can imagine a ring around a pulsar and I'm sure your viewers and listeners can imagine

182
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:37,360
that as the pulsars spewing those concentrated streams of energy it would be they would be

183
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:42,240
orientated along the ring the interior of the ring and it would be such power you know that

184
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:48,000
in such efficiency that you don't need you don't need to build such a massive structure

185
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:53,920
you know right now like for example we wanted to build a Dyson shell that completely enveloped

186
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:58,640
our sun here in our own solar system I think Andrew Sandberg is probably the leading guy that's

187
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:04,480
done this math among others and it's like yeah like you got to take apart Mercury probably

188
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:08,800
take a huge chunk out of Venus and let's go dive into the cores of the gas giants and next

189
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:13,680
you know like we're kind of starting to run out of actual material in the in our own solar system

190
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:19,200
to build such a thing so there is kind of like a prohibitive nature to to that as well so if you

191
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:23,840
if you can be more economical in terms of the material that you need to to build then why not

192
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:29,600
you know exploit perhaps better sources of that energy such as pulsars and there's even talk of

193
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:35,760
like for example creating similar structures around a black hole so what you do is let's say you know

194
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:42,560
black holes what they do is when they're uh when they're pulling in material they also spew a stream

195
00:18:42,560 --> 00:18:52,240
of high energetic jet of photons so what you can do is I'll likewise set up a massive you know a raise

196
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:56,800
energy extracting a raise at the at the exit point there where the jet is streaming out

197
00:18:56,800 --> 00:19:01,520
and you know that's your turbo your energy turbine for lack of a better word that that works there

198
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:06,400
or we can like deliberately shove a star or several several stars into a black hole to

199
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:13,280
even create facilitate this process and create even more output for us so um maybe it's not so

200
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:18,800
much a passive thing in terms of just some and capturing our star as it is going out there and

201
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:24,160
finding better places to exploit but now at this point really what we're talking about is we're now

202
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:28,720
escalating down that Kardashian scale we're now definitely I would say you gotta start at a k

203
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:37,040
two and then you know I don't think you go from k one to having you know a pulsar capable

204
00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:41,120
Dyson shell I think you gotta you graduate towards you know to those you know means of

205
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:49,840
k ability and as you're working your way toward that k uh that uh I guess toward that k three status

206
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:56,320
so um so yeah um I forgot even what the initial question was Adam you have to remind me what

207
00:19:57,200 --> 00:20:03,200
well you know what um I'm I'm just wondering like I guess we spoke about like a um what it means to

208
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:09,920
to not see any evidence of galactic structures or expansion of civilizations out there and we

209
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:14,720
we started to speak about the Fermi paradox and and Drake equation I brought up and

210
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:21,600
Robin Hansen brought up the great filter argument and he described the that we should be concerned

211
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:27,520
if there aren't any galactic spanning civilizations out there because it decreases the likelihood

212
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:32,400
that we will be able to reach that sort of status ourselves that will likely go extinct

213
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:40,720
yeah uh it's a very potent uh an upsetting idea and uh yeah I mean the the search for

214
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:48,160
Dyson instructors has only really just begun um so that was just to be fair but there have been

215
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:55,600
searches and nothing has come up yet but more more practically I suppose uh considering the

216
00:20:55,600 --> 00:21:01,360
contributions of Enrico Fermi um it shouldn't even matter uh whether or not we see these spheres

217
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:09,840
or not what matters is that we we just seem to be uh completely um out of touch with other

218
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:14,960
extraterrestrial civilizations we see no no signs of anything they never they don't appear to travel

219
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:21,600
through the solar system um and what that means is is that and that for the casual listener that

220
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:25,280
might be the world I you know maybe you know maybe there've been tons of you know aliens that

221
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:30,240
sit through our solar system and and certainly while there's a I suppose a chance of that

222
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:35,280
there is a general feeling in the futurist community and those who are engaged in this

223
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:41,360
kind of deep deep kind of speculation that look when a and when when we're when we're talking

224
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:44,480
about these advanced civilizations they're not just going out on field trips you know

225
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:48,960
at holidays to visit star systems what we're talking about are is are expanding bubbles of

226
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:55,680
the civilization itself and that when it reaches another star system uh it doesn't just you know

227
00:21:55,680 --> 00:22:01,680
pass through it actually will make it its own it'll actually adopt it build its own probably

228
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:07,120
you know extract all the resources it possibly can to continue to fuel its civilizations uh spread

229
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:14,000
including building a distance here around uh the star of that system completely transforming it

230
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:19,520
even more speculative everything and everything we're saying is so super specular but why not

231
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:24,240
let's just keep going if then you get some objectives like oh Star Trek Prime Directive

232
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:28,960
they come here and they'd be like oh there's intelligent civilization on earth we have to

233
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:34,640
leave them alone because it's Prime Directive like no no no no no like that what the the

234
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:39,120
very least what they would do is uh well destroy us but i doubt that that's the case i think more

235
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:45,440
plausibly than uplift us so within a snap of the finger they would basically uh integrate us within

236
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:50,960
their own civilization by whatever means is available to them so that's become part of the

237
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:55,440
organism become part of the board collective we'd be subsumed into their civilization hopefully it

238
00:22:55,440 --> 00:23:01,520
would be a benign and uh enlightened uplift and not a like the board is obviously as a dystopian

239
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:07,120
scenario as it gets uh you would hope that that's not the kind of uh assimilation that would

240
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:12,080
happen and instead what i mean uplift i mean in the truest kind of like you know sense where we

241
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:19,360
would be uh you know bioengineer uh reconfigurated to be this kind of post biological uh entity that

242
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:24,800
they themselves are most assuredly uh that they most assuredly have become i'm not imagining

243
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:32,000
green aliens visiting us i'm imagining you know um uh machine minds digital beings passing through

244
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:40,000
here uh transforming you know the galaxy uh as they expand out through the milky way so yes so i

245
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:44,640
just stand step back a bit so yes it does not appear that we have been visited by extraterrestrial

246
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:49,680
civilizations why because everything looks pretty peaceful natural uh you know in a as that currently

247
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:53,840
you know that we've nothing but we're not touched we're not touched solar system so

248
00:23:55,360 --> 00:24:00,640
um and as far as we can tell you know as we look out into the galaxy it looks like all of the other

249
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:05,600
star systems in our galaxy are the same of the same way although it's we still we have yet to see

250
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:11,920
any sign of something that's you know undeniably uh inalienably uh artificial in nature everything

251
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:17,840
this does appear to be out there we look out in space it's very these are all natural processes

252
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:23,040
everything fits in nice and cosily you know within the laws of physics as we know it so there's no

253
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:31,840
reason for us to believe that that we're looking into uh you know a highly technified uh galaxy so

254
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:37,440
that's that's kind of essentially i mean that's probably taking what Fermi said a little too far

255
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:42,400
all his observation was like oh my god like we you know we we should have definitely seen somebody

256
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:50,400
by now like uh what he what's what's what's potent about the Fermi paradox is he basically

257
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:54,800
eliminated time as a factor because that what would you a common argument is like oh there

258
00:24:54,800 --> 00:25:02,400
hasn't been enough time uh for civilizations to occupy the entire galaxy um and that's fundamentally

259
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:09,520
wrong uh there has been more than enough time our galaxy is really really old and has been able to

260
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:16,080
host a biological life for a very long time uh long enough such that uh you know this galaxy

261
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:21,920
should have been colonized you know not just once but multiple times yet it's not it hasn't happened

262
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:27,200
and that's kind of alarming and that's what you know Robin Hansen has said well maybe it's because

263
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:33,440
it doesn't happen that there is this kind of great filter in effect where that you know no civilization

264
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:44,160
can and there's a certain developmental stage that nobody can get past and it could it might be

265
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:50,320
self-destruction of some sort it i mean it could be let's say a technological a complete you know

266
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:56,880
technological hurdle um even if you even go for example it could even go back in time to the uh the

267
00:25:56,880 --> 00:26:03,600
the the rise of uh you know uh from you know single sub-life to multi-cellular life and that

268
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:07,360
that's the case that's actually amazing new that's the best news i could possibly share with anybody

269
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:11,200
today because it means we've actually passed the great filter and that we're freaks we shouldn't

270
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:16,480
actually even be here and we might even be the only civilization in the entire universe for

271
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:20,880
certainly in the galaxy that somehow we leaked through this filter where you know no other

272
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:24,560
planet that was even possible so that that's we don't in other words we don't know if the filters

273
00:26:24,560 --> 00:26:30,320
behind us or if it's still ahead of us personally i'm inclined to think that it's it's ahead of us

274
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:35,360
that we're heading toward our daily our inevitable doom and that there's something that will prevent

275
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:41,840
us from building dyson spheres and becoming a kardash of you know you know 2.4 civilizations

276
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:46,720
and so on which is a kind of depressing thought but unfortunately that's potentially where the

277
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:52,320
evidence is leading us in terms of trying to understand you know our future there were other

278
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:58,560
possibilities of course i mean this is quite alarming but it's also um a great motivation

279
00:26:58,560 --> 00:27:06,080
to be extra careful and to do whatever we can to increase the likelihood of um becoming aware

280
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:12,640
of potential filter should be stepping right into one and mitigate the likelihood that that'll

281
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:19,200
wipe us out like all filters you know something gets through like a great filter is considered

282
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:26,400
like to be many like like robert hanson described it as a whole like range of things but um like

283
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:33,280
steps going up a staircase now some some life doesn't make it beyond the first step some life

284
00:27:33,280 --> 00:27:39,200
makes it beyond the second and third and fourth maybe we're on the 16th and there's a 17 18 19

285
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:45,840
20th before we reach a technological mature civilization um so hopefully they don't like

286
00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:51,520
squash us out of existence before we do that right yes it's an interesting thought and uh

287
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:55,680
i mean we there's no shortage of threats in our future i mean we could we could go on and on about

288
00:27:55,680 --> 00:27:59,520
artificial superintelligence we could talk about molecular nanotechnology we can talk about you

289
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:04,480
know deliberately engineered viruses and on and on and on not to mention the nuclear threat which

290
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:10,720
remains an apocalyptic uh risk um so there's still that and like i said things that we could probably

291
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:15,200
invent that we don't even know are possible but there's also nothing to consider is that

292
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:21,120
maybe there are modalities of existence that advanced life you know um kind of escapes into

293
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:26,960
that doesn't involve you know uh you know this kind of you know colonization way that we've been

294
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:33,520
talking about um yet you know at the same time these these solutions have to do two things that

295
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:39,520
has to satisfy the energy requirements needed to enter into that desirable modality of existence

296
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:43,600
and it has to be a solution that applies to every other single uh advanced extraterrestrial

297
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:48,480
civilization out there not just the subset because when it didn't apply to every uh advanced sieve

298
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:53,920
then at least some would decide to embark upon colonization campaigns and again the solution

299
00:28:54,560 --> 00:28:58,640
has to take that into consideration has to come up with a like i said like a solution that's like

300
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:05,760
well what what's to prevent everybody from venturing out and reworking the uh Milky Way

301
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:10,320
in their own image so that's that to consider well there's yeah exactly there's a prism

302
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:17,920
prisoner's dilemma right where um if you're ever aware that you have galactic neighbors

303
00:29:17,920 --> 00:29:24,320
or that you are suspicious that one you have galactic neighbors you're going to try um and get

304
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:30,880
all the resources that you can to preemptively protect yourself or even use to attack this

305
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:37,280
potential neighbor so that they don't do exactly the same thing everybody like would be thinking

306
00:29:37,280 --> 00:29:44,320
of the same thing um let's reduce let's let's grab the resources so that we can defend and attack

307
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:50,240
and perhaps even preemptively strike because our neighbors might be also thinking of

308
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:55,280
preemptively striking whether they're aggressive or not they may decide that that's just the most

309
00:29:55,280 --> 00:30:01,840
rational self-interested thing to do yeah that's a very depressing thought i mean uh it's uh and

310
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:05,200
i love that you invoke the prisoner's dilemma there and it does seem that that's kind of the

311
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:09,600
situation like you know what do you do with partial information you know what do you do you

312
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:15,520
know when you're not entirely sure what um you know a cohort is what kind of decisions a cohort

313
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:21,040
is going to make and yeah just the whole maxian concept you therefore unleash a whole fleet of

314
00:30:21,040 --> 00:30:27,840
berserker probes and sterilize the uh the Milky Way before you know a berserker uh you know swarm

315
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:32,880
you know uh wipes you up uh again that's another i find also find it fascinating maybe more

316
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:38,480
optimistically that we also have no evidence of berserker probes again a berserker probe is um

317
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:44,800
this idea that uh instead of like happy von Neumann probes that are self-replicating probes that go

318
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:49,440
out there and do exploratory work or even colonization work um and then again like I said they

319
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:55,120
self-replicate and they continue to spread and spread and spread in a very happy way um uh berserker

320
00:30:55,120 --> 00:31:01,680
probes just simply go out and uh just destroy uh basically they're sterilization waves and

321
00:31:01,680 --> 00:31:06,480
then it would be it would be well it could be one of several reasons as to why this can happen

322
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:12,800
well one is just pure like malevolence just to like create this kind of scorched earth policy or

323
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:19,360
scorched galaxy scorched galaxy he has scorched galaxy policy to bring just as a protective

324
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:25,280
measure so a defensive measure um it could be uh like a rogue ai has gone completely you know

325
00:31:25,280 --> 00:31:30,480
mad and it's just you know uh you know or just as or just again I don't want to speculate on

326
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:37,360
the reasons but I mean it's it's the fact is that we've not actually seen such a way make our

327
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:42,320
and make us way through our galaxy uh simply because we're here uh we're talking about berserker

328
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:44,800
probes so if you're talking about berserker probes they're probably things that they don't

329
00:31:44,800 --> 00:31:50,080
actually exist uh so that's how like I said it'd be more optimistic way of looking at it

330
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:58,400
yeah that's true um now you've done like you've recorded like a whole taxonomy of different

331
00:31:58,400 --> 00:32:05,680
types of like possible von Neumann probes right um yeah and you you you're in discussions with

332
00:32:05,680 --> 00:32:12,160
aliezer and what was it nick buster maybe and is sandberg um trying to sort of lay out at least

333
00:32:12,160 --> 00:32:17,280
some of these different yeah one of the ones um this came out of a discussion at uh chicago in

334
00:32:17,280 --> 00:32:25,280
two 2008 i think transvision and uh it's kind of like aliezer the greatest term for you call it

335
00:32:25,280 --> 00:32:30,320
the whack-a-mole hypothesis which is this idea that you that yeah that you have kind of like

336
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:34,720
berserker probes do exist but they're they're they're they're they're they're discriminant as

337
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:41,840
opposed to indiscriminate so like similar to like uh the the monolith on the moon uh in 2001

338
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:45,840
it's just hanging out kind of waiting for us to reach a certain developmental stage

339
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:50,640
and then it's kind of like kicks into action and it does what it does uh again what what a

340
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:56,640
wonderful idea by Arthur C Clarke but anyways uh so the idea of the of the whack-a-mole uh

341
00:32:56,640 --> 00:33:03,200
discriminant probe is that it's waiting simply to see what becomes of us uh after the as a result

342
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:08,560
of our own technological singularity that one of the big things that Yadkowski talks about is that

343
00:33:08,560 --> 00:33:13,040
there isn't necessarily just one kind of artificial super intelligence that can emerge that there's a

344
00:33:13,040 --> 00:33:19,920
whole family of different types that can come out of the technological singularity we just don't know

345
00:33:19,920 --> 00:33:24,880
what kind we're going to produce and nor do the aliens know what kind we're going to produce

346
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:30,320
whether it's a happy version or a sad version so let's say it's hanging out there and we can't

347
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:38,400
detect it it it's it sees it oh we've passed the technological singularity and it's a oh it's a good

348
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:42,720
good ai we're going to let them live and we're going to just let them be or integrate us or whatever

349
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:47,680
or if it's a potentially dangerous artificial super intelligence when they even threatens

350
00:33:47,680 --> 00:33:55,440
the aliens is uh ongoing survival then it will extinguish us and that's the end of that so that's

351
00:33:55,440 --> 00:34:01,920
just that's one idea and um uh and even as another idea for these uh self-replicating or not even

352
00:34:01,920 --> 00:34:05,920
self-replicating but just this idea of probe technology Andrew Sandberg has also speculated

353
00:34:05,920 --> 00:34:10,400
about uh kind of like policing probes which is kind of like maybe a more enlightened idea what

354
00:34:10,400 --> 00:34:15,120
you were suggesting earlier about uh you know going out just you know terminating uh potential

355
00:34:15,120 --> 00:34:21,520
threats is just basically exactly that just kind of like policing and uh kind of just assessing and

356
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:27,040
just uh making sure that any any threats that or anything that's coming in is what was desirable

357
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:31,200
rather than uh than you know than potential threat so in other words we may not have to

358
00:34:31,200 --> 00:34:37,120
be a prisoner's dilemma sort of situation we can maybe have this kind of intermediary situation

359
00:34:37,120 --> 00:34:40,640
where we can kind of just get a sense as to the intentions of that extraterrestrial civilization

360
00:34:40,640 --> 00:34:46,240
but um yeah there's uh there's different you know ways of thinking about this problem

361
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:55,120
oh absolutely and that's a whole whack-a-mole or whack-a-civilization idea brings up some absurd

362
00:34:55,120 --> 00:35:07,440
visuals in my head yes um yeah so well I guess you've also been given us a very uh interesting

363
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:15,840
step-by-step description of how we could bootstrap a um a galactic civilization starting with a

364
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:21,920
Dyson sphere or a Dyson swarm usually people um mean Dyson swarms when they say Dyson spheres

365
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:28,400
and not a thing that sort of shell with gravity problems um yeah so do you want to just step us

366
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:35,600
through sure and to be clear and to be clear this idea is uh is not my own it's uh it was

367
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:41,120
Stuart Armstrong from Oxford University who first articulated this particular model for

368
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:48,880
or like you suggested bootstrapping the Dyson sphere and what I did was I kind of distilled

369
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:55,600
his ideas and popularized it and I've been happy to talk about talk about it ever since but definitely

370
00:35:55,600 --> 00:36:01,280
he deserves full credit for this idea so what it is is what he was saying is that really that

371
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:07,440
within short order we will um be able to start working on this it is not something that we should

372
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:13,680
think of as you know being so far away in the future and uh or something that only you know you

373
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:18,160
know the civilization is far and away in the future we'll be able to uh to mark up on this he said

374
00:36:18,160 --> 00:36:24,080
that you know we should probably start thinking about you know building uh this structure relatively

375
00:36:24,080 --> 00:36:28,480
soon and and well yes it's going to require some new tech and new ingenuity and new capabilities

376
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:34,800
but um we can get going because ultimately he said if we kind of get started on it that the

377
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:42,960
kind of like this very first uh uh stage of the sphere or swarm will become operational you know

378
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:47,760
you don't need like the whole thing you don't build the whole thing and then turn it on uh we've

379
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:52,720
kind of silly um be like actually you know what I'm imagining like the scene when you're you know

380
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:57,200
you you put the lights on a Christmas tree and you hit the start button and uh it doesn't turn

381
00:36:57,200 --> 00:37:00,640
on it was one of the lights is this is actually out but that's kind of like old I guess it's

382
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:04,160
old school technology I'm just imagining what you're seeing with it okay let's start up the

383
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:10,880
Dyson Swarm and the sound from the blade and that's not starting correctly so no what to do is you

384
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:18,480
create a huge chunk that is going to be uh drawing power from the sun transforming it into useful

385
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:24,000
energy and what Stuart Armstrong was arguing is that you there you then use this to now

386
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:29,760
newfound energy source to continue to fuel the construction of the Dyson Swarm and this becomes

387
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:38,000
this kind of like it becomes this exponentially improving process and no manpower will be required

388
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:42,800
because the way he envisioned it is you're going to have probes robotic uh sorry robotic devices

389
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:49,680
working in space to actually construct um these these these panels these receivers

390
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:56,640
and they would also this have to work in tandem with mining expeditions to the inner planets and

391
00:37:56,640 --> 00:38:01,840
perhaps even the asteroid belt and the outer planets uh unfortunately we'd have to say goodbye to

392
00:38:01,840 --> 00:38:11,040
Mercury um and possibly parts of Venus and like I said the asteroid belt and uh other places in

393
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:15,520
the uh the solar system and that clearly will create a lot of upset I mean already just when I

394
00:38:15,840 --> 00:38:19,600
write about it people write get I get very angry angry letters like how dare you talk about the

395
00:38:19,600 --> 00:38:29,520
dismantling of the solar system and I okay well I mean my only concern about it is that it uh it

396
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:34,400
could disrupt the kind of orbital equilibrium that we do see in the solar system that there is this

397
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:42,240
kind of like um there is this prospect where if you suddenly remove a planet from its orbital plane

398
00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:46,080
it can have this rippling gravitational effects down the line we perturb the trajectories of

399
00:38:46,080 --> 00:38:50,480
planets and what that does is over the course of many millions of years we can actually result in

400
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:57,040
collisions between planets uh which is not good last night check so that's that's one one possibility

401
00:38:57,040 --> 00:39:02,400
but like let's let's be let's be honest like Mercury is useless right there's it's it's it's just

402
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:07,840
baked in radiation and there's nothing of value there I mean aside from just for the sake of it

403
00:39:07,840 --> 00:39:12,640
being there Venus I'm not even going to speak speak to me it's interesting only from a scientific

404
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:16,400
perspective in the sense that we they could maybe help us understand our climate models a bit better

405
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:21,440
and what you know the potential risks are uh and what some like severe case situations are like for

406
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:26,000
what an atmosphere can actually do like that's pretty scary when you look at you know what because

407
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:30,000
Venus is a sister planet to our own like it's so close to us it's basically the same size as ours

408
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:34,880
yet it's a complete shell and uh what's it what happened like what's the difference between us and

409
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:41,280
that so yeah before we dismantle Venus I would like us to know how it came to be and actually

410
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:44,880
what excitingly NASA is actually considering a couple of missions finally I think one of the most

411
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:49,760
even those that are closest celestial neighbors one of the most neglected planets in the solar system

412
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:54,160
yet it should be I think a high priority that we understand it a little better obviously all the

413
00:39:54,160 --> 00:40:00,160
focus is on Mars because it has this this this this historical potential for habitability certainly

414
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:05,360
doesn't have that anymore um so that's why there's all this excitement about Mars but we also think

415
00:40:05,360 --> 00:40:10,240
of it as you know there's potentially you know planet B for us which again is a as I don't know

416
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:14,800
if you you were you caught this one Adam but um last year I wrote a piece called why will never

417
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:21,600
colonize Mars generated a lot of excitement and a lot of upset and I basically argued that Mars

418
00:40:21,600 --> 00:40:25,200
is not what you think it is and the whole these all these ideas of like how great it's going to be

419
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:29,760
to live on Mars and colonize it and terraform and all that is a bit of a pipe dream and it's complete

420
00:40:30,160 --> 00:40:36,080
um uh you know um completely neglects you know the hardships and realities of doing so

421
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:44,320
so so yeah um well yeah I agree this can be really hard in our current biological form

422
00:40:44,320 --> 00:40:50,960
but by the stage we you know um build a maybe a type two Kardashev civilization we can have the

423
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:56,080
ability to sort of adapt ourselves to sort of operate in a variety of environments probably

424
00:40:56,080 --> 00:41:01,200
a lot more hardship than Mars for sure and I was at the long term I was a bit cheeky in my

425
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:05,920
headline there when I said humans will never colonize Mars because it was my excuse to say

426
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:12,880
yeah post-humans can colonize Mars so that that was kind of like where I was coming at uh on that one

427
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:18,640
so uh definitely I definitely made at that point that yeah we had modified humans and that's a

428
00:41:18,640 --> 00:41:25,760
different story altogether so um yeah so back to the building of the Dyson sphere uh basically

429
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:33,040
once you've created this core um uh panel then it becomes a sex financial thing and uh I mean

430
00:41:33,040 --> 00:41:37,440
Armstrong's predictions were that you could do this in maybe four stages I think five stages and it

431
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:41,600
would only take you know a few decades once you went to the ball once the ball was really rolling

432
00:41:42,320 --> 00:41:48,720
and I mean uh I mean this idea has been attacked uh for not just because you require the dismantling

433
00:41:48,720 --> 00:41:54,400
of planets but also the time obviously the time scale I I agree um maybe when I wrote this article

434
00:41:54,400 --> 00:42:00,400
about 10 or 12 years ago I maybe overstated um our ability to get into space and work into space

435
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:06,240
we're finding it to be much more difficult than we could have ever imagined and uh you know that's

436
00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:11,440
just the sheer cost alone of you know rockets uh delivering rockets and we're seeing this the

437
00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:16,320
private sector finally getting a bit of a handle on this but it's still the lot the launch requirements

438
00:42:16,320 --> 00:42:20,640
the technological requirements the ability to actually have machines working on mercury for

439
00:42:20,640 --> 00:42:26,640
example that would not you know succumb to the elements like to be fair we're still quite a ways

440
00:42:26,640 --> 00:42:32,000
off from being able to do this but like I like I said one thing I will stand by is that it's not

441
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:36,000
too early to think about it you know let's let's let's let's talk about it let's make up some

442
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:40,880
plans let's maybe make some timelines like let's maybe say hey what's the tech that we need to do

443
00:42:40,880 --> 00:42:45,200
this what's the material that we need to do this you know what what kind of what how would a robot

444
00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:49,280
actually work on mercury to kind of dig down deep into that we need to actually access them

445
00:42:49,520 --> 00:42:53,680
usable materials and what do we do with all the waste and all this stuff these are questions we

446
00:42:53,680 --> 00:42:57,440
can ask right now and get some very smart people working on even if even if it's just let's say

447
00:42:57,440 --> 00:43:01,600
from uh like a crowdsourced perspective obviously I think academics should be talking about this but

448
00:43:01,600 --> 00:43:05,760
maybe you know just as an active community so I mean obviously you've got the Mars Society and

449
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:11,200
people talking about that um people it's just so devoted to colonizing Mars so why don't we have

450
00:43:11,200 --> 00:43:16,640
you know a group of people devoted to getting the ball rolling on the creation of a dexon

451
00:43:16,640 --> 00:43:24,240
swarm so uh timelines okay maybe not maybe what we what we thought but certainly I don't discount

452
00:43:24,960 --> 00:43:29,600
what Armstrong suggested though that once the ball is rolling though and it does become this

453
00:43:29,600 --> 00:43:34,320
awesome feedback process where now you can really in earnest build this thing rather quickly next thing

454
00:43:34,320 --> 00:43:40,480
you know you've got this you've got a dexon swarm so um one of the the way again one of the real

455
00:43:40,480 --> 00:43:45,360
points here in the article what and uh what Armstrong was even arguing was that again this

456
00:43:45,360 --> 00:43:51,520
is something that is plausible you know this is not what Dyson was conjecturing about was

457
00:43:51,520 --> 00:43:57,760
fascinatingly intriguingly um you know doable and you know it was it was it was just kind of blew

458
00:43:57,760 --> 00:44:01,200
my mind to see a guy actually put pen to paper and say here's how we can do it at least at a

459
00:44:01,200 --> 00:44:06,400
conceptual level that it made sense to me and I continue to think it's just a fascinating possibility

460
00:44:07,760 --> 00:44:13,520
oh indeed yeah so I mean in terms of the timeline to actually bootstrap to get started in this

461
00:44:13,520 --> 00:44:18,080
process seriously and start at least using some of the energy that we can harvest from the sun

462
00:44:18,080 --> 00:44:25,200
with a few uh I guess um panels in place as the beginning of a Dyson swarm how long do you think

463
00:44:25,200 --> 00:44:32,880
that would take? Armstrong said 40 years which is crazy but that that's what that's what that's what

464
00:44:32,880 --> 00:44:38,320
he said so um 40 years to get started no oh sorry I think you know the complete completion of the

465
00:44:38,320 --> 00:44:42,160
swarm you're asking me like when we can actually get started on the project to start building the

466
00:44:42,160 --> 00:44:49,920
first one yeah what's your opinion on that? Oh boy um not for a few decades I mean we're still at

467
00:44:49,920 --> 00:44:56,720
the stage where kind of crazy because like we're talking about like NASA's now and Congress is

468
00:44:56,720 --> 00:45:06,400
earnestly talking about a mission to Mars by 20 in the 2030s for example and uh the fact is that

469
00:45:06,400 --> 00:45:13,040
we're embarking on a really small step still like we're still not working on the moon we don't even

470
00:45:13,040 --> 00:45:20,720
have a moon a moon an orbital moon base we haven't even been to Mars yet um you know it and we don't

471
00:45:20,720 --> 00:45:25,280
know some of the uh not only do we not know the technical hurdles that await we don't know the

472
00:45:25,280 --> 00:45:33,840
socio-economic hurdles that await as well um our situation here on earth can start to get so dire

473
00:45:33,840 --> 00:45:40,800
in terms of the environment that uh deep space exploration and uh and work out there will have

474
00:45:40,800 --> 00:45:44,400
to take a backseat to the problems that need to be addressed here at home and it's going to be

475
00:45:44,400 --> 00:45:50,000
increasingly difficult for governments to justify the spending taxpayer money you know for what could

476
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:55,680
be deemed as these rather uplandish uh science fictiony uh prospect I'm not saying I agree with

477
00:45:55,680 --> 00:46:01,520
that perspective I'm saying that will be a prevailing perspective so it's because of these

478
00:46:01,520 --> 00:46:07,440
kind of realities that you have to temper these kinds of expectations so to answer your question

479
00:46:07,440 --> 00:46:13,840
maybe not sadly maybe not for a to 100 years uh and yeah of course like I said a lot of there are a

480
00:46:13,840 --> 00:46:20,080
lot of wild cards and blacks wants to consider between them both ones that can continue to

481
00:46:20,080 --> 00:46:26,800
satisfy but even like blacks ones that could perhaps uh be good like let's say an artificial

482
00:46:27,040 --> 00:46:31,920
that's we kind of have this kind of like uh an artificial super intelligence that that we can

483
00:46:32,560 --> 00:46:38,720
kind of understand and control uh very dubious that we could do that but um let's say that we

484
00:46:38,720 --> 00:46:43,680
kind of like start to offload some of these design and engineering tasks to artificial intelligence

485
00:46:44,320 --> 00:46:50,320
uh and we find ways of let's say you know becoming more economically uh stable and having the means

486
00:46:50,320 --> 00:46:54,880
the resources with which to launch the source of expeditions so those things kind of came together

487
00:46:54,880 --> 00:46:58,640
then all that's our offer terms of when we could start to mark upon this project so that's the case

488
00:46:58,640 --> 00:47:04,640
I would say you know after the 2050s uh 2060s recently I will I will add though I'm turning 50

489
00:47:04,640 --> 00:47:11,760
this year this is just a an aside almost any irrelevant aside but turning 50 this year and

490
00:47:11,760 --> 00:47:15,920
you start to do the mat like when I was a kid like you'd see the oh yeah you know NASA's

491
00:47:15,920 --> 00:47:20,240
launching probes to this planet or this moon and it's going to take 15 years to get there or

492
00:47:20,240 --> 00:47:25,200
whatever it's going to be 25 year long project and you you kind of it's easy for you to digest that

493
00:47:25,200 --> 00:47:29,040
it's you know think a lot it's still far away in the future which you can digest it now like for

494
00:47:29,040 --> 00:47:34,160
example there uh that NASA's going to be sending a probe to uh to tighten it's fascinating it's

495
00:47:34,160 --> 00:47:38,560
going to be actually uh a drone it'll be able to fly through the atmosphere because it actually has

496
00:47:38,560 --> 00:47:43,920
an atmosphere and uh yeah it's going to be it'll be landing in the mid 2030s assuming they can get

497
00:47:43,920 --> 00:47:51,040
it going and yeah I'm going to be like I'll be like 64 65 years old when it happens and uh radical

498
00:47:51,040 --> 00:47:58,720
life extension Adam notwithstanding I'm hoping in terms of what you know what you know what you

499
00:47:58,720 --> 00:48:02,880
know what how our health can be prolonged in the future I tend to be a status cool type of a type

500
00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:07,520
of a person I don't tend to assume that that's going to happen um I take I assume that I'll be

501
00:48:07,520 --> 00:48:15,680
aging normally and I'll die you know at a depth you know as per the situation today it'd be wonderful

502
00:48:15,680 --> 00:48:20,720
you know I could prolong my life but it does seem that I'm starting to get to a point now in in my

503
00:48:20,720 --> 00:48:26,880
life where perhaps some of these longer scale uh prospects are something I'll never live to see

504
00:48:27,600 --> 00:48:33,360
and uh you eventually there's going to be some kind of a project where yeah if I do the math I'll be

505
00:48:33,440 --> 00:48:38,240
115 but it actually gets rolling in other words I probably won't be alive to see it

506
00:48:38,240 --> 00:48:43,200
so I'm not sure why I'm bringing this up just aside from the fact that um starting to it does

507
00:48:43,200 --> 00:48:47,280
affect perhaps the way you look at the future and understand that yeah you know life will absolutely

508
00:48:47,280 --> 00:48:52,480
go on without you being there and of course without you being there to observe it and appreciate it

509
00:48:52,480 --> 00:48:56,240
but of course that doesn't mean you should think it's still gonna not gonna happen most certainly

510
00:48:56,240 --> 00:49:00,880
you should never let that prevent you know this kind of multi-generational thinking I for example

511
00:49:00,880 --> 00:49:08,320
I'm a firm staunch believer that we should start to not not just talk about uh Dyson swarms

512
00:49:08,320 --> 00:49:15,520
in construction let's start talking about interstellar uh expeditions you know we've got Voyager

513
00:49:15,520 --> 00:49:20,160
the Voyager 2 probes you know they they're incredible but why don't we scale up something

514
00:49:20,160 --> 00:49:24,880
like that you get a massive you know I think uh they're already been like Stephen Hawking talked

515
00:49:24,880 --> 00:49:32,400
about this for example creating these ships with solar sails that my god like these things once they

516
00:49:32,400 --> 00:49:38,720
get cooking and moving in space powered only by like uh the the particles emanating out from the sun

517
00:49:38,720 --> 00:49:43,280
but then a short matter of time it'll be moving at 10 the speed of light you know that suddenly

518
00:49:44,160 --> 00:49:49,040
these relativistic speeds the the nearby star systems aren't so far away anymore and now you're

519
00:49:49,040 --> 00:49:54,800
talking about missions that are like what 10 40 years you know instead of like prohibitively long

520
00:49:54,800 --> 00:49:59,440
like like wait like Voyager's not going to reach the first possible star system for like tens of

521
00:49:59,440 --> 00:50:04,960
thousands like hundreds of thousands of years obviously that's super discouraging but anyways

522
00:50:04,960 --> 00:50:11,360
point being is I would love us to start taking the long new bold ideas yeah we may not live to

523
00:50:11,360 --> 00:50:16,800
see it in our own lifetime but maybe you know generations four five 10 20 from now will absolutely

524
00:50:16,800 --> 00:50:21,680
yield the benefits of this it could even be potentially existentially worthwhile the sense

525
00:50:21,680 --> 00:50:27,920
that it could actually get detect you know habitable systems uh to learn from the science of these

526
00:50:27,920 --> 00:50:34,400
expeditions and uh so I think we should also start thinking along those lines as well yeah the idea of

527
00:50:35,440 --> 00:50:41,920
astronomical waste comes to mind and population axiology or population ethics where um we should

528
00:50:41,920 --> 00:50:48,880
be considering the moral relevance of people who are not yet around or like slots for life that are

529
00:50:48,880 --> 00:50:56,960
not yet available can we say um and if we were to go extinct or to um I guess be damned to live

530
00:50:56,960 --> 00:51:03,120
only on this sort of film on top of this rock called earth in this tiny portion of our own

531
00:51:03,120 --> 00:51:10,160
galaxy let alone all the others then that would be a shame um because there's a whole lot of

532
00:51:10,160 --> 00:51:16,880
matter out there that doesn't isn't being sort of used to support lives worth living um and so

533
00:51:16,880 --> 00:51:23,280
yeah it there's a paper out there called um something along the lines of astronomical waste

534
00:51:24,480 --> 00:51:32,000
yeah but it's quite interesting when you start thinking about the huge sheer amount of possible

535
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:39,760
lives worth living that could be cut short or just never actually be realized if we go extinct or if

536
00:51:40,720 --> 00:51:46,960
we just never get off earth yeah and you know bringing it back full circle to freeman dyson

537
00:51:46,960 --> 00:51:51,040
if he were here talking to us right now he'd be absolutely on board with what we're talking about

538
00:51:51,040 --> 00:51:59,840
he was actually a big thinker in terms of uh the future human trajectory and uh he you know he

539
00:51:59,840 --> 00:52:04,480
what did he say fair his book very famously said infinite in all directions now it's in such a

540
00:52:04,480 --> 00:52:10,160
beautiful beautiful term and but he believed it you know like even thought that you know eventually

541
00:52:10,160 --> 00:52:18,240
we could find ways of uh you know um prolonging the existence of a civilization um you know by

542
00:52:18,240 --> 00:52:22,560
slowing i i have to forgive me if i get this a little bit wrong but basically what he was suggesting

543
00:52:22,560 --> 00:52:29,280
is that uh we we dramatically slow down like the clock speed of civilization to the to the point

544
00:52:29,280 --> 00:52:35,920
where it's so excruciatingly slow that the time ticks relative to the actual how time is elapsing

545
00:52:35,920 --> 00:52:41,280
around it that it might as well be you know quasi infinite in terms of how long the civilization

546
00:52:41,280 --> 00:52:47,440
could actually last given the constraints of of course of cosmology uh i think he came up with

547
00:52:47,440 --> 00:52:56,560
these ideas back in the 70s when we saw a different view of uh cosmological evolution and development

548
00:52:56,560 --> 00:53:02,640
we now know for example that the universe will eventually start to expand and expand quicker

549
00:53:02,640 --> 00:53:07,360
and quicker and quicker which will preclude i think some of these uh ideas of you know finding

550
00:53:07,360 --> 00:53:11,840
almost like infinite ways of prolonging human existence or post-human existence whatever will be

551
00:53:12,480 --> 00:53:19,200
like 22 30 billion years from now but um yeah he was definitely online with this thinking like

552
00:53:19,200 --> 00:53:23,520
like think big think bigger like that's i think that's one of the more fascinating aspects about

553
00:53:23,520 --> 00:53:28,800
Freeman Dyson was how he would kind of like just take things to a level that perhaps you know

554
00:53:29,360 --> 00:53:35,280
no one uh no one had before you know when we were talking about a guy who penned this thing in 1959

555
00:53:35,920 --> 00:53:42,720
okay it's it's hard for us perhaps to understand how radical an idea that would be okay this is

556
00:53:42,720 --> 00:53:48,080
in 1959 say hey extra trust you we're gonna build what he didn't call him Dyson's spheres and people

557
00:53:48,160 --> 00:53:53,200
called it after that like they named it after him yes he actually didn't like the term that that

558
00:53:53,200 --> 00:53:58,480
was named after him but i will say he got the idea from Olaf Stapleton and that very good point

559
00:53:58,480 --> 00:54:03,280
actually um and thank you for bringing that up he it's not was not his idea yeah you got it from

560
00:54:03,280 --> 00:54:07,200
science fiction Olaf Stapleton and perhaps even others were already talking about ideas such as this

561
00:54:07,920 --> 00:54:13,280
again he just looked at it as a potential solution for you know the insatiable energy demands of a

562
00:54:13,280 --> 00:54:17,600
civilization but i thought it was pretty great like when i heard that he had died a couple of days

563
00:54:17,600 --> 00:54:24,400
ago i thought you know i mean i really hope that we build a Dyson swarm if not for the simple reason

564
00:54:24,400 --> 00:54:30,000
that we can call it a Dyson swarm or a Dyson sphere that it would what a legacy that would be as a

565
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:37,040
thinker to have a megastructure you know of such magnitude be actually named after him and i think

566
00:54:37,040 --> 00:54:41,600
i just i would just love for that to actually happen even if he didn't like the term too bad

567
00:54:41,600 --> 00:54:48,880
freeman you came up with an awesome idea or at least populated popularized and more fully

568
00:54:48,880 --> 00:54:53,440
articulated the idea again with all due respect to Olaf Stapleton maybe i take back what i said

569
00:54:53,440 --> 00:54:57,760
make sure you call them stapleton swarms i don't know but but still i think we're pretty damn cool

570
00:54:57,760 --> 00:55:03,840
we actually do call it that we we build something like that but anyways point being that how radical

571
00:55:03,840 --> 00:55:08,960
must have been for him to not only just talk about megastructures but to talk about it in

572
00:55:08,960 --> 00:55:13,520
the context of the search for extraterrestrial intelligence which i'm not sure that was even

573
00:55:13,520 --> 00:55:20,560
determined existed in 1959 it wasn't until uh drake in the like what 1964 or so and project osma and

574
00:55:20,560 --> 00:55:26,320
the first efforts at radio set he got underway so this could predates for even radio like actual

575
00:55:26,320 --> 00:55:33,200
efforts for radio set city so today we can talk about amazingly we can talk about megastructures

576
00:55:33,200 --> 00:55:39,760
and dyson sphere uh you know without blinking an eye and batting an eye like for example um a couple

577
00:55:39,760 --> 00:55:46,240
years ago there was that uh variable star which is called boy a boy on star is this tabby star the

578
00:55:46,240 --> 00:55:52,000
same thing tabby star it's the same star it's the same thing and that had this unexplainable

579
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:59,200
irregular dimming episodes and a number of you know theories were posited to explain it uh

580
00:55:59,920 --> 00:56:05,920
of uh in the from a natural perspective but inevitably it got people thinking well maybe

581
00:56:05,920 --> 00:56:11,840
this is actually evidence of uh and the first data point we have of an alien megastructure

582
00:56:11,840 --> 00:56:16,800
and what delighted me as a journalist covering this stuff well was that i could actually just you

583
00:56:16,800 --> 00:56:20,160
know matter of fact we say yeah could this could actually this is actually being entertaining as

584
00:56:20,160 --> 00:56:25,360
possible and i didn't have to like like really beat people over the head to understand it and i

585
00:56:25,360 --> 00:56:28,320
and appreciate it like people like oh i know i've heard of that i don't have a nice enchilas you

586
00:56:28,320 --> 00:56:31,920
know or whether it'd be through the science fiction or whether just through casual conversations

587
00:56:31,920 --> 00:56:38,480
becoming whereas we had to fight for dysonian city you know just tended to 15 years ago it's now

588
00:56:38,480 --> 00:56:42,960
almost taken for granted that that's how we should look for extra trust with civilizations that and

589
00:56:42,960 --> 00:56:47,200
now almost the the radio study almost seems anachronistic i still believe we should we should

590
00:56:47,200 --> 00:56:51,680
do it don't get me wrong i still think we should listen to radio signals but now yeah let's let's

591
00:56:51,680 --> 00:56:57,360
look for uh like i said other techno signatures even laser settings becoming a thing and all that so

592
00:56:57,360 --> 00:57:03,120
um again but again um i just find it interesting that uh freeman dyson being the free thinker

593
00:57:03,120 --> 00:57:08,160
that he was you know just had it you know just thought this is what needs to be said and thought

594
00:57:08,160 --> 00:57:17,040
through and you know and not like i say is what it is i've often thought about like what others

595
00:57:17,040 --> 00:57:27,520
like strong attractors could um i guess motivate a civilization to uh expand in a way which is

596
00:57:27,520 --> 00:57:33,440
indetectable um and you know at least molin came out with the idea that like maybe black holes

597
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:39,440
born universes and and there's other sort of permutations and an idea and and perhaps

598
00:57:40,160 --> 00:57:47,760
uh galactic civilizations engineer or optimize black holes to spew forth the types of idealized

599
00:57:47,760 --> 00:57:56,320
universes for computation and and and life right um and they think that you know they sort of ascend

600
00:57:56,320 --> 00:58:03,840
or transcend in some way to to a better reality or a reality more conducive towards flourishing

601
00:58:04,480 --> 00:58:09,200
i kind of hope that that's possible and that's a good reason why we can't see

602
00:58:09,760 --> 00:58:16,960
other civilizations out there but what are your thoughts on um i guess strategies for

603
00:58:16,960 --> 00:58:24,960
civilizations to continue without being detected so again i have to work under the um the data

604
00:58:24,960 --> 00:58:31,440
that we have right now which does suggest that advanced civilizations should they exist they

605
00:58:31,440 --> 00:58:38,000
don't become interstellar colonists that just that's that's the assumption that i'm working under

606
00:58:38,640 --> 00:58:44,800
so i'm a bit i guess i can call me like a contact pessimist or even like a you know

607
00:58:45,520 --> 00:58:51,520
just you just doubt that's kind of like within our within our future uh future means so i keep

608
00:58:51,520 --> 00:58:56,240
asking the question well how the why then what is this kind of modality that a civilization

609
00:58:56,240 --> 00:59:03,120
would enter into that's that's that's still uh deemed of value and uh it just it mean it just

610
00:59:03,120 --> 00:59:10,800
keeps coming back to this idea of uh of you know this internal existence that living within ourselves

611
00:59:10,800 --> 00:59:17,360
like locally and not branching out like just finding uh you know means to uh you know perpetually have

612
00:59:17,360 --> 00:59:23,360
access to resources that might mean star hopping or parking near a perpetual energy source of some

613
00:59:23,360 --> 00:59:28,960
sort um but living more modestly in that sense and yeah just running you know ancestor civilizations

614
00:59:28,960 --> 00:59:35,360
or hedonistic civilizations and living out you know the the the remaining duration of the cosmos

615
00:59:35,360 --> 00:59:39,520
in in that manner that's kind of like the best solution that i can come up at this point that's

616
00:59:39,520 --> 00:59:46,080
still that that in my opinion uh does not violate the uh the non-exclusivity issue and at the same

617
00:59:46,080 --> 00:59:51,360
time um answers the question as to why we've not made contact with anybody else that maybe we're

618
00:59:51,360 --> 00:59:56,640
all just inherently xenophobic and we just keep to ourselves we enter into this uh happy heaven

619
00:59:56,640 --> 01:00:02,800
like modality and that's that's and then in that post-unit of happily ever after the end so

620
01:00:02,800 --> 01:00:06,480
i'm not suggesting for a second that that's what will happen or that's the greatest solution to

621
01:00:06,480 --> 01:00:12,720
this but it's certainly one that uh occupies some of my thought uh in terms of um what's the solution

622
01:00:12,720 --> 01:00:19,680
here what's the what's actually going to happen what's a non-exclusivity issue it means that um

623
01:00:19,680 --> 01:00:24,080
it has to be a solution that every single extraterrestrial civilization will independently

624
01:00:24,080 --> 01:00:29,200
uh enter into and that there can't be any outliers because if there were outliers and we would have

625
01:00:29,760 --> 01:00:35,280
made contact with them by now they would have made their presence known that's again

626
01:00:35,280 --> 01:00:40,720
working under those kinds of uh constraints i suppose in terms of uh when used to kind of

627
01:00:40,720 --> 01:00:47,200
make these sorts of uh extrapolations i guess freeman dyson did have some controversial opinions

628
01:00:47,200 --> 01:00:54,800
and views um and one of them was uh that he was sort of critical of climate change models or that

629
01:00:55,680 --> 01:01:04,640
whether climate change would have a serious impact on global health and viability yeah he

630
01:01:04,640 --> 01:01:09,680
kind of alienated a lot of people toward the end of his life and um yeah he was not kind of on board

631
01:01:09,680 --> 01:01:15,360
the whole um you know climate justice span wagon and quite the opposite and uh you know

632
01:01:16,240 --> 01:01:20,720
he he said himself that you know to be a good scientist kind of like means you have to be

633
01:01:20,720 --> 01:01:25,360
subversive i don't think you ever liked i think the more popular an idea you know became i think

634
01:01:25,360 --> 01:01:30,160
the less inclined it was to latch on to it kind of i was looking for ways to kind of chip away at it

635
01:01:30,880 --> 01:01:37,280
and climate change was certainly um one of those targets and uh yeah he kind of thought that

636
01:01:37,280 --> 01:01:44,160
scientists were i think it was a bit of a climate change skeptic first of all um but even if you did

637
01:01:44,160 --> 01:01:50,640
buy into the models he kind of thought well it's not so bad you know which from today's perspective

638
01:01:50,640 --> 01:01:54,560
like i don't have to tell you as a someone who lives in australia like well it is kind of bad

639
01:01:54,560 --> 01:02:00,240
i think it's kind of like it's a show you know it's just awful and uh like because he was saying

640
01:02:00,240 --> 01:02:04,880
oh it's great that carbon dioxide is great for plants and you know create these lush environments

641
01:02:04,880 --> 01:02:10,960
and um all these kinds of like this i think the hand way these sort of um you know proclamations

642
01:02:10,960 --> 01:02:15,440
that it got me thinking well he's a he's a big thinker but he was also maybe sometimes spoke

643
01:02:15,440 --> 01:02:20,080
outside of his immediate area of expertise and maybe didn't think through some of the repercussions

644
01:02:21,200 --> 01:02:28,400
of this yeah i will say at the same time he's like the only climate skeptic or whatever you

645
01:02:28,400 --> 01:02:34,080
want to call it actually i kind of he'll ring in my ear every once in a while you know like

646
01:02:34,080 --> 01:02:39,120
you for example you'll study like Jurassic environments and you understand that you know

647
01:02:39,120 --> 01:02:44,240
there was no polar caps at that time and the dinosaurs lived at a very unique time in our

648
01:02:45,360 --> 01:02:50,400
interplanets history and understand that yeah we're the climate change is an indelible part of

649
01:02:50,400 --> 01:02:55,840
this planet's history like the planet in fact the history of this planet is simply the history of

650
01:02:55,840 --> 01:03:01,520
climate change and in this constant study of how the planet has changed and how animals have reacted

651
01:03:01,520 --> 01:03:06,240
to this to climate change over time and that includes all kinds of different things um hominins

652
01:03:06,240 --> 01:03:11,440
and uh of course dinosaurs and animals and all sorts of things so um you know you do have to

653
01:03:11,440 --> 01:03:16,960
look at climate change that that lens yeah what's i don't have to remind you or your listeners

654
01:03:16,960 --> 01:03:21,920
obviously this is characteristically different because we're the ones that are now responsible

655
01:03:21,920 --> 01:03:27,520
for it and we're kind of uh causing this change on timescales that are unprecedented in the planet's

656
01:03:27,520 --> 01:03:33,200
history like it's uh these spikes are just unreal in terms of how quickly uh we're able to now impact

657
01:03:33,200 --> 01:03:39,440
upon uh the environment you know it also gets me i'm thinking even about kardashev's scale because

658
01:03:39,440 --> 01:03:44,560
kardashev says talks about k-1 civilizations and you know harnessing of the entire uh energy

659
01:03:44,560 --> 01:03:50,400
output of the planet one thing kardashev would not have been concerned about well at what cost

660
01:03:50,400 --> 01:03:56,160
to the environment what does that mean in terms of the heat expenditure uh you know uh if a whole

661
01:03:56,160 --> 01:04:01,840
planet you know is working in that way like what is what is that doing environmentally what is it

662
01:04:01,840 --> 01:04:07,280
doing to sustainability is it viable sustainable is this you know is it actually creating a planet

663
01:04:07,280 --> 01:04:14,720
that's actually going to be able to continue to move forward in time and uh uh and and still sustain

664
01:04:14,720 --> 01:04:20,320
you know what what we would value in terms of wildlife and uh and plant life and all that sort of

665
01:04:20,320 --> 01:04:25,440
stuff so um it's one thing to conjecture about is one of the things sometimes one of the most

666
01:04:25,440 --> 01:04:29,920
difficult things is to project outcomes and consequences and i think maybe that's where

667
01:04:29,920 --> 01:04:35,440
freeman dyson was maybe a little lacking and and i could do cavalier perhaps about what he thought

668
01:04:35,440 --> 01:04:41,120
were the ill effects of climate change and and not to accuse him of this but maybe simply because

669
01:04:41,120 --> 01:04:47,680
it was at the sake of being contrary and being that that that guy who was that um you know to be

670
01:04:47,680 --> 01:04:52,960
that kind of deviant when it came to scientific uh to scientific thinking so that sadly will

671
01:04:52,960 --> 01:04:59,760
probably be one one area in which he will not be fondly uh remembered as uh i think

672
01:05:00,480 --> 01:05:03,600
we can pretty much agree that uh climate change is something that needs to be

673
01:05:04,240 --> 01:05:13,120
mitigated rather than celebrated right but um yes so a lot of people have controversial opinions

674
01:05:13,120 --> 01:05:19,120
and it shouldn't really detract from the value they contribute in other areas um and i think

675
01:05:19,120 --> 01:05:25,200
some people like to demonize thinkers because they come up with one controversial opinion

676
01:05:26,160 --> 01:05:31,360
and that can kind of be like throwing the baby out with the bathwater which is i think silly

677
01:05:31,360 --> 01:05:39,440
yeah yeah no no for sure i mean uh i you know i have you know so many quote unquote heroes that

678
01:05:39,440 --> 01:05:44,960
that i admire but i don't think there's a i would never say like the reason why i had to put heroes

679
01:05:44,960 --> 01:05:50,080
in scare quotes is because you know whether it be carl saying it or freeman dyson or anyone of

680
01:05:50,080 --> 01:05:53,680
these people that i hugely admire they're not perfect and there's always something about their

681
01:05:53,680 --> 01:05:58,160
personality or something they might have done or something that they believe in that there's

682
01:05:58,160 --> 01:06:04,960
absolutely not you know conform to my own beliefs or values so i i would never say that i would i

683
01:06:04,960 --> 01:06:10,480
will unabashedly feel and irreservedly follow someone and declare them you know to be the

684
01:06:10,480 --> 01:06:16,480
perfect hero for me that that does not exist for for me personally so i could admire the

685
01:06:16,480 --> 01:06:20,640
hell out of somebody that doesn't mean i have to buy an absolutely everything that they have to say

686
01:06:20,640 --> 01:06:26,880
so i kind of yeah totally agree with you yeah yeah is there any other points which you'd like to

687
01:06:26,880 --> 01:06:34,480
bring up at this stage which we haven't yet covered um uh you know we we boy we we covered a lot there

688
01:06:34,480 --> 01:06:39,280
i just want to just uh maybe back to tabby star just to say that it's not it i don't know we've

689
01:06:39,280 --> 01:06:44,560
kind of came full circle on that it's not a megastructure um right now they're pretty sure it's

690
01:06:44,560 --> 01:06:49,440
still uh uh some kind of naturalistic phenomenon and it was a fascinating paper a few months ago

691
01:06:49,440 --> 01:06:56,960
suggested that what it might actually be is a disintegrating moon so what what happens in some

692
01:06:56,960 --> 01:07:03,920
star systems is that uh a planet uh will at the end of its life get subsumed by its host star

693
01:07:03,920 --> 01:07:09,040
and it'll bring along its moon or moons with it in this case they're saying that that did not

694
01:07:09,040 --> 01:07:17,200
happen that the moon got ejected and it's slowly disintegrating um as it is also being a subsumed

695
01:07:17,200 --> 01:07:24,960
by the star it's kind of creating this anomalous debris field that uh is uh uh that is infrequent in

696
01:07:24,960 --> 01:07:29,840
terms of uh how it's happening and that's the explanation and i actually talked to dr boyan

697
01:07:29,840 --> 01:07:35,600
about this and she thought it was an intriguing possibility so um i decided to mention that

698
01:07:35,600 --> 01:07:38,640
because i didn't want your listeners to think that it was still people are still very much thinking

699
01:07:38,640 --> 01:07:45,040
that it's a megastructure it's we're pretty sure it's not but i think it's pretty exciting um that

700
01:07:45,040 --> 01:07:50,000
we can talk about this possibility yet at the same time you never want to you know whenever we

701
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:54,960
see something that you don't understand is put your hands and say oh my god we don't understand it

702
01:07:54,960 --> 01:07:59,840
it's gotta be aliens like i think that's i'm not suggesting we should do that by no means in fact

703
01:07:59,840 --> 01:08:06,480
we're talking about pulsars earlier the first pulsars that were discovered were so odd to

704
01:08:06,480 --> 01:08:10,800
astronomers they had no explanation for them because these things are blinking with such

705
01:08:10,800 --> 01:08:14,640
extreme rapidity and regularity like that was their first thought too and i think they're actually

706
01:08:14,640 --> 01:08:20,240
in the notes they're like was like lg uh lg m's they called them or something like that which meant

707
01:08:20,240 --> 01:08:23,280
like little green man or something like that basically hinting that oh my god we're maybe

708
01:08:23,280 --> 01:08:27,600
discovered you know some kind of alien signature here it turned out not to be the case but there

709
01:08:27,600 --> 01:08:33,200
always is this tendency that when we do see something that's super weird and it defies our

710
01:08:33,200 --> 01:08:38,240
expectations there is this tendency to invoke extraterrestrial life i'm not saying that's

711
01:08:38,240 --> 01:08:43,520
the healthiest thing to do it should be this kind of last resort if you will kind of like that

712
01:08:43,520 --> 01:08:47,840
like the anecdote at the end of an anecdote to say after we've exhausted all these possibilities

713
01:08:47,840 --> 01:08:53,440
you know a through f let's just maybe keep an open mind that it kind of maybe is consistent with what

714
01:08:53,440 --> 01:08:59,520
we think is technosignature could look like it's that's all i want to say about tabby star um at

715
01:08:59,520 --> 01:09:08,800
this point awesome well um i guess if you'd like to conclude what if you were to meet somebody

716
01:09:09,360 --> 01:09:17,120
who was thinking about donating their large fortune towards some form of exploratory research

717
01:09:17,920 --> 01:09:21,760
what would it be and how would you convince them to do something that you value

718
01:09:21,760 --> 01:09:27,680
that maybe relates to our discussion today wow that's that's a heck of a question i never

719
01:09:27,840 --> 01:09:33,120
really given not really giving so much thought to that like i will say that it might be an answer

720
01:09:33,120 --> 01:09:38,480
that um it's kind of like unsexy uh relative to discussion or even irrelevant to the

721
01:09:38,480 --> 01:09:43,120
discussions we just had but i admire for example the bill and blend the gates foundation for what

722
01:09:43,120 --> 01:09:48,240
they've done in terms of being smart about where they spend their money and in particular as to

723
01:09:48,800 --> 01:09:54,480
what they deem to be areas that are most in need and for example a big thing for them is

724
01:09:55,360 --> 01:10:01,040
neglect the tropical diseases and uh obviously you know with the COVID-19 being what it is right

725
01:10:01,040 --> 01:10:07,040
now that's not a neglect the tropical disease obviously but it just shows that we are still

726
01:10:08,720 --> 01:10:15,600
victimized by microorganisms like in a way like that's just unreal you know we we like to think

727
01:10:15,600 --> 01:10:20,640
that we have a handle on on nature that we don't we're not preyed upon by lions anymore you know

728
01:10:20,640 --> 01:10:25,760
or wolves um but we're most certainly preyed upon by other kinds of animals and they're

729
01:10:25,760 --> 01:10:33,120
microscopic in size whether it be malaria you know zika virus um you know the common flu

730
01:10:33,120 --> 01:10:39,760
and the cold and now the COVID-19 uh disease it's uh i think that we need we need to continue to

731
01:10:39,760 --> 01:10:43,520
spend our money and our resources on those kinds of threats because at the end of the day and at

732
01:10:43,520 --> 01:10:47,760
the end of the year when you look at the uh you know the actuarial tables those are the things that

733
01:10:47,760 --> 01:10:53,840
are killing us uh you know at a horrific scale you know that's what's killing us on mass and we

734
01:10:53,840 --> 01:11:00,320
need to get a handle on that and similarly the back out include bacteria and bacterial infections in

735
01:11:00,320 --> 01:11:05,280
that in that uh the body of thinking and we're heading toward the so-called you know antibiotic

736
01:11:05,280 --> 01:11:08,880
apocalypse where there are antibiotics looks like they're not they're increasingly becoming

737
01:11:08,880 --> 01:11:13,680
ineffective and we're starting to talk about you know super viruses that are even super immune to

738
01:11:14,640 --> 01:11:19,520
um standard uh cocktails of antibiotics so these are the kinds of things that scare the crap out of

739
01:11:19,520 --> 01:11:26,080
me and me too and it should scare your listeners as well and so yeah that's if i'm okay you know

740
01:11:26,080 --> 01:11:31,840
i think that people with horrendous amounts of money should probably spend it to alleviate those

741
01:11:31,840 --> 01:11:40,880
kinds of uh blights so that's how i will answer that well george it's been an amazing mind blowing

742
01:11:40,880 --> 01:11:46,000
discussion i i love talking about these topics and i really appreciate the time here that was fun

743
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:51,040

744
01:11:51,040 --> 01:12:04,720
