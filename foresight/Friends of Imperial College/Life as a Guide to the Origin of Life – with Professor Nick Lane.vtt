00:00.000 --> 00:09.840
This is a question I've been working on for a long time now, and the last few years have

00:09.840 --> 00:16.600
become, I would say, really quite exciting, and the central ideas have become more crystallized

00:16.600 --> 00:21.840
in my mind than they had been before, and it's very much about using life as a guide

00:21.840 --> 00:28.280
to the origin of life, which immediately sounds like it's tautologous in some way, that

00:28.280 --> 00:36.000
it's, I could call it turtles all the way down, it seems as if there's an infinite regress

00:36.000 --> 00:43.360
involved in that, but it begs the question, how can we possibly know what the answer is?

00:43.360 --> 00:47.360
And if you take it almost literally and say, imagine that we had a time machine and we

00:47.360 --> 00:53.920
go back to some time around the origin of life, what would we actually look for?

00:53.920 --> 00:58.480
And the answer is, well, we would have no idea if we found some kind of green slime

00:58.480 --> 01:03.720
or something, we wouldn't really know, was this the origin of life, was this just some

01:03.720 --> 01:10.280
slime, was it on the path towards life, was it a failed experiment?

01:10.280 --> 01:15.520
Actually what we really need to know, what we really need to have is a framework, a rigorous

01:15.520 --> 01:21.240
intellectual framework which shows how a sterile non-living planet can give rise to

01:21.240 --> 01:25.360
a living planet and we need to know what all the predicted steps would be along that

01:25.360 --> 01:32.840
path and then how to test for them to see whether or not they actually have any substance

01:32.840 --> 01:34.800
in them or not.

01:34.800 --> 01:39.080
And so we'll never know how life started on Earth because it's a historical question

01:39.080 --> 01:43.480
and we can't go back and if we did go back, as I say, we still wouldn't actually see what

01:43.480 --> 01:44.560
the answer was.

01:44.560 --> 01:50.520
What we need is this rigorous framework and that's where I think life as a guide comes

01:50.520 --> 01:58.040
in because there is a spectrum and that spectrum starts somewhere almost unknowable, but let's

01:58.040 --> 02:02.720
assume for the sake of argument that it was on the early Earth and that it was in Earth-like

02:02.720 --> 02:10.240
conditions rather than in outer space somewhere or, you know, panspermia may have happened,

02:10.240 --> 02:13.520
however, it tells us nothing about the conditions under which life can start.

02:13.520 --> 02:18.200
So it's an assumption that life started on Earth and we know the other end of the continuum,

02:18.200 --> 02:22.320
the other end of this continuum is life itself, cells like bacterial cells that have a genetic

02:22.320 --> 02:28.360
code that have DNA and RNA and proteins and membranes and everything else we know about

02:28.360 --> 02:29.600
cells.

02:29.600 --> 02:33.120
So we know one end of the continuum and all we need to do is figure out the other end

02:33.120 --> 02:36.200
and how to join it up.

02:36.200 --> 02:42.520
Now what I'll argue very briefly then is that life is an extremely good guide to its own

02:42.520 --> 02:45.040
origin and I'm going to break it into three sections.

02:45.040 --> 02:49.360
One is energy, the second is metabolism, and the third is genetic information.

02:49.360 --> 02:52.240
So I will try and address all three today.

02:52.240 --> 02:59.000
Before I get going, I'm going to just orientate you with a few slides about what I mean by

02:59.000 --> 03:00.440
energy and so on.

03:00.440 --> 03:05.960
So this is, you could imagine it as a bacterial cell or you could see it as the mitochondria

03:05.960 --> 03:10.840
in our own cells, but effectively what we're seeing here inside this lozenge-shaped thing,

03:10.840 --> 03:18.120
if that is a cell, I'm showing it respiring and respiration is effectively taking something

03:18.120 --> 03:22.840
like glucose, breaking it down through the Krebs cycle, and the Krebs cycle, you don't

03:22.840 --> 03:24.160
need to know what it is.

03:24.160 --> 03:31.720
All it's really doing is stripping CO2 and hydrogen out of food, out of any organic molecules.

03:31.720 --> 03:43.400
Now the CO2 is a waste product which we simply breathe out, and the hydrogen is not in the

03:43.400 --> 03:48.800
form of hydrogen, it's in the form of NADH in our own cells, but it's basically two

03:48.800 --> 03:50.400
hydrogen atoms.

03:50.400 --> 03:57.320
They are being split for physicists, we're going to get somewhere in the vicinity of

03:57.320 --> 04:02.200
fundamental particles, so it's basically electrons and protons.

04:02.200 --> 04:09.600
The electrons are passed to oxygen in the membrane, so it has effectively a current

04:09.600 --> 04:14.920
of electrons within an insulating membrane through redox centers in that membrane, and

04:14.920 --> 04:19.280
the current of electrons powers the extrusion of protons across the membrane, which is

04:19.280 --> 04:25.840
what I'm showing, let me just get a pointer up on here.

04:25.840 --> 04:29.720
So we have a charge on the membrane, the protons are positively charged of course,

04:29.720 --> 04:35.280
and so we have a relatively positive charge on the outside of the membrane, relatively

04:35.280 --> 04:38.520
negative inside, and that's known as the proton motive force.

04:38.520 --> 04:44.560
It drives for example ATP synthesis, but it basically drives all work in cells, and that's

04:44.560 --> 04:45.560
all we need to know.

04:45.560 --> 04:49.920
We can put ATP aside for the time being and just think of we have an electrically charged

04:49.920 --> 04:55.560
membrane that drives powers work in cells, and that I think is the fundamental thing

04:55.560 --> 04:56.680
that we need to explain.

04:56.680 --> 05:04.120
Why is it that cells work by having an electrical charge on the membrane that powers work?

05:04.120 --> 05:09.480
That's much easier to understand than something like the ATP synthase as a protein.

05:09.480 --> 05:14.640
This is the next slide, I forgive you if you don't notice any difference whatsoever, but

05:14.640 --> 05:18.800
in fact everything has just been turned on its head here.

05:18.800 --> 05:24.320
The Krebs cycle is now going in the opposite direction, those arrows switched around.

05:24.320 --> 05:33.040
It's deliberately looking the same because the reverse Krebs cycle takes CO2 and hydrogen

05:33.040 --> 05:37.280
from its environment and cobbles them together to make organic molecules.

05:37.280 --> 05:47.280
This happens in various bacteria, it's pretty ancient, and obviously if we get energy out

05:47.280 --> 05:52.040
of burning sugars in the Krebs cycle now, then the missing ingredient there is we have

05:52.040 --> 05:57.320
to put energy in to make these Krebs cycle intermediates from CO2 and hydrogen.

05:57.320 --> 06:02.280
That energy is coming from exactly what I was just talking about, a charge, an electrical

06:02.280 --> 06:08.320
charge on the membrane which is driving the reverse Krebs cycle to make organic molecules

06:08.320 --> 06:13.920
from CO2 and hydrogen, simple gases in the environment.

06:13.920 --> 06:17.680
That Krebs cycle is the center of all of metabolism really.

06:17.680 --> 06:21.040
We make lipids for the membranes, we make amino acids for proteins.

06:21.040 --> 06:26.960
We make sugars and nucleotides from ultimately from Krebs cycle intermediates.

06:26.960 --> 06:30.560
This is the core and the heart of metabolism across all of life.

06:30.560 --> 06:36.160
This is more ancient chemistry than the genes that appear to encode that chemistry.

06:36.160 --> 06:41.120
The genes diverge and differ in bacteria and archaea, but the chemistry underlying it remains

06:41.120 --> 06:43.520
the same.

06:43.520 --> 06:47.960
The third aspect is information.

06:47.960 --> 06:54.600
In this case, I will touch on this at the end and there are patterns in the genetic code

06:54.600 --> 07:00.040
which suggests that there are direct interactions between amino acids and the nucleotides that

07:00.040 --> 07:03.280
code for them in the genetic code.

07:03.280 --> 07:07.480
We don't know exactly what they look like, I'm giving a couple of possible ways of imagining

07:07.480 --> 07:14.360
it here, but I will show you that those patterns are real and they're weak and they're statistical

07:14.360 --> 07:20.880
but they are real and this can explain the origin of information in biology.

07:20.880 --> 07:26.840
In effect, if what we have is a random sequence of RNA, we could say it has no biological

07:26.840 --> 07:35.320
information in it, and that templates in one way or another a non-random peptide which

07:35.320 --> 07:42.560
has function in the context of, say, growing protocells, and I'll come onto that, then

07:42.560 --> 07:46.400
we can select for the sequence which selects for a non-random peptide which has a function

07:46.400 --> 07:51.680
in that context, and so information seamlessly emerges, biological information emerges with

07:51.680 --> 07:56.880
selection on that sequence in that context, and so there is no problem with the origin

07:56.880 --> 08:01.440
of information in biology if we get the context right.

08:01.440 --> 08:05.640
Those are some big claims there and I'll justify them at the end.

08:05.640 --> 08:10.440
Another thing to notice about that is I'm talking about electrical charges on membranes

08:10.440 --> 08:16.240
driving autotrophic biochemistry starting with CO2 and hydrogen to make all the components

08:16.240 --> 08:21.520
of biochemistry which then interact with nucleotides and genetic information comes into existence

08:21.520 --> 08:22.520
in this context.

08:22.520 --> 08:25.800
In other words, I'm saying everything is happening in the same environment and that's another

08:25.800 --> 08:26.800
big ask.

08:27.160 --> 08:31.760
I'm not saying that some stuff happens in the atmosphere over there and some other things

08:31.760 --> 08:35.800
happened in a deep sea hydrothermal vent and some things happen in Darwin's warm pond.

08:35.800 --> 08:40.920
I'm saying it's all happening in one place right now, all at once, and that's a big

08:40.920 --> 08:48.240
ask, but it's experimentally very simplifying because it means that we need one set of conditions

08:48.240 --> 08:53.760
that are capable of driving all this, and so it becomes experimentally very tractable.

08:53.760 --> 09:00.440
The set of conditions that drive it were proposed not by me at all, by Mike Russell,

09:00.440 --> 09:06.120
more than anybody else, but quite a few people have worked on this over 30 years or so now.

09:06.120 --> 09:10.480
The conditions, again, keeping this as simple as possible, the conditions that Mike has

09:10.480 --> 09:18.680
talked about are hydrogen and CO2 in these alkaline hydrothermal vents which are now found

09:18.680 --> 09:23.760
at the bottom of the ocean, but also other environments as well, including on land.

09:23.760 --> 09:31.480
At the right hand side here you can see that these are effectively a labyrinth of interconnected

09:31.480 --> 09:36.280
pores on a micrometer to millimeter scale.

09:36.280 --> 09:42.240
This is modern chemistry in modern oceans, fully oxygenated, and is not reflective of

09:42.240 --> 09:46.640
what we would expect to see four billion years ago in the Haiti, and when there was no oxygen

09:46.640 --> 09:53.320
there was much more, for example, ferrous iron in the oceans back then.

09:53.320 --> 09:57.760
These vents should have had perhaps a similar topology, but the actual chemistry would have

09:57.760 --> 10:03.080
been different and would have included reactive iron-sulfide minerals in there.

10:03.080 --> 10:08.280
The hydrothermal fluids are strongly alkaline, pH 11, the early oceans we think would have

10:08.280 --> 10:13.440
been mildly acidic, perhaps pH 5 or 6, and so there would have been steep proton gradients

10:13.440 --> 10:20.720
across these barriers, and those steep proton gradients in principle can drive work in pretty

10:20.720 --> 10:24.720
much the same way that the proton motive force would drive work in cells.

10:24.720 --> 10:29.080
It's not exactly an electrical charge, but it's very close to being the same kind of

10:29.080 --> 10:30.560
structure.

10:30.560 --> 10:32.800
This is effectively it.

10:32.800 --> 10:37.760
We have at the left hand side here an inorganic pore at the right hand side a cell.

10:37.760 --> 10:43.400
What a cell is doing is pumping protons out across its plasma membrane, so we end up with

10:43.400 --> 10:49.480
this high proton concentration and relatively positive charge on the outside and relatively

10:49.480 --> 10:55.280
alkaline on the inside, and it's about a three to four pH unit difference, equivalent to

10:55.280 --> 10:57.320
a three to four pH unit difference.

10:57.320 --> 11:03.040
In a hydrothermal vent we've got, again, at least arguably a three to four pH unit difference

11:03.040 --> 11:10.400
between the inside of a proto, of a pore, let's call it, and ocean waters percolating

11:10.400 --> 11:11.640
into these vents.

11:11.640 --> 11:16.560
We have a much thicker inorganic barrier surrounding it, and that barrier is likely

11:16.560 --> 11:22.440
to include minerals like iron sulfur minerals that couldn't drive some of this work.

11:22.440 --> 11:26.440
Is there a way, an imaginable way, that we can go from one of those to the other?

11:26.440 --> 11:30.320
This is the hypothesis in a nutshell, and the rest of the talk I'll just give a little

11:30.320 --> 11:34.000
bit of data on trying to test this hypothesis.

11:34.000 --> 11:41.480
What you're seeing here is a pore in a hydrothermal vent is relatively rich in protons outside.

11:41.480 --> 11:43.880
We have this iron sulfide barrier.

11:43.880 --> 11:50.000
I'm imagining protons crossing this barrier and driving the reverse Krebs cycle inside

11:50.000 --> 11:56.120
this proto, a pore, let's just call it a pore at the moment, so we've got hydrogen

11:56.120 --> 12:02.200
reacting with CO2 driven by an influx of protons, pretty much as happens in cells today.

12:02.200 --> 12:07.920
We would expect to see thermodynamically at least fatty acids, so components of lipids

12:07.920 --> 12:10.840
and probably some amino acids from that.

12:10.840 --> 12:14.200
If we look to the right-hand side, what would we expect those to do?

12:14.200 --> 12:18.120
The fatty acids should form some kind of a bilayer membrane, which we can imagine at

12:18.120 --> 12:23.440
least might just sit snugly inside this pore.

12:23.440 --> 12:31.080
Once we've closed down an enclosed proto cell inside here, we might expect that metabolism

12:31.080 --> 12:35.600
will drive further, so not just lipids and amino acids, but perhaps sugars and nucleotides

12:35.600 --> 12:36.600
as well.

12:36.600 --> 12:37.600
This is imaginable.

12:37.600 --> 12:39.720
This is at least a hypothesis.

12:39.720 --> 12:45.080
It's also that for protons to be driving Krebs cycle inside a proto cell, we would

12:45.080 --> 12:52.480
need to have some kind of an iron-sulfur nanocrystal or iron-sulfur clusters, the same kind of thing

12:52.480 --> 12:58.440
that drives this work today, it would need to be sitting in that membrane.

12:58.440 --> 13:02.480
You could label this wishful thinking, but you could also call it a testable hypothesis,

13:02.480 --> 13:05.080
and that's how I've been treating it over the last few years.

13:05.080 --> 13:09.440
I'm going to break it into these three parts, and I'll skip quite lightly over it, and we

13:09.440 --> 13:14.840
can discuss some of the data at more length afterwards.

13:14.840 --> 13:19.120
This idea, though, that proton gradients are fundamental, it's something I've been thinking

13:19.120 --> 13:26.120
about for a long time, and I tended to think of it in terms of driving molecular machinery

13:26.120 --> 13:28.880
rather than as simply phase separations.

13:28.880 --> 13:35.400
Now, Peter Mitchell himself, who put this chemo-osmotic hypothesis forward back in the

13:35.480 --> 13:41.280
1960s, had been thinking about the origin of life before that in the late 1950s, and

13:41.280 --> 13:48.280
there's a lovely quote from a conference in Moscow in 1957 where he said, I cannot consider

13:48.280 --> 13:51.000
the organism without its environment.

13:51.000 --> 13:55.120
From a formal point of view, the two may be regarded as equivalent phases between which

13:55.120 --> 13:59.680
dynamic contact is maintained by the membranes that separate and link them.

13:59.680 --> 14:04.480
When he says organism here, he's thinking of a bacterial cell, but instead of trying

14:04.520 --> 14:08.600
to define life as something different to the environment, he's more or less conflating them.

14:08.600 --> 14:16.600
He's describing them as equivalent phases between which this dynamic contact is maintained.

14:16.720 --> 14:22.880
And if we think before there were any cells, before there was anything living, then the

14:22.880 --> 14:27.560
idea of a membrane that separates and links two equivalent phases is a very productive

14:27.560 --> 14:32.960
way of thinking about the question.

14:32.960 --> 14:35.080
So why would that matter?

14:35.080 --> 14:37.360
Well, in essence, it's this.

14:37.360 --> 14:42.200
The problem with hydrogen is it will not react very readily with CO2.

14:42.200 --> 14:47.960
This is just showing vague thermodynamics for two steps rather than a single step, which

14:47.960 --> 14:51.280
is why I call it vague, through to formaldehyde.

14:51.280 --> 14:56.400
So taking the electrons from hydrogen, pushing them onto CO2 to form formaldehyde.

14:56.400 --> 15:01.960
At pH 7 or any other pH, all I really, for non-chemists, all I really want you to take

15:02.000 --> 15:04.400
away is it's an uphill reaction.

15:04.400 --> 15:07.480
It's not going to happen spontaneously.

15:07.480 --> 15:13.720
But we don't have hydrogen at pH 7 and we don't have CO2 at pH 7 in an alkaline hydrothermal

15:13.720 --> 15:18.080
vent. We've got hydrogen at pH 11 and CO2 at pH 6, say.

15:18.080 --> 15:20.640
And that shifts these equations around.

15:20.640 --> 15:25.960
And the reason for it is very simple, intuitively, to grasp if hydrogen gives up its electrons

15:25.960 --> 15:28.440
in an alkaline environment, what's left behind is protons.

15:28.440 --> 15:32.920
Those protons will react immediately with hydroxide ions to form water.

15:32.920 --> 15:34.640
It's just a neutralization reaction.

15:34.640 --> 15:36.560
It's strongly favored.

15:36.560 --> 15:39.680
And so it will happen immediately.

15:39.680 --> 15:44.160
So hydrogen is more reducing in an alkaline environment.

15:44.160 --> 15:46.880
CO2 needs to pick up electrons.

15:46.880 --> 15:49.840
If there are plenty of protons available, they will balance the charges.

15:49.840 --> 15:52.800
And then you can pick up more electrons and more protons.

15:52.800 --> 15:56.320
So it's easier to reduce CO2 in an acidic environment.

15:56.320 --> 16:01.120
So what we have here, then, is effectively two phases, an alkaline phase and an acid

16:01.120 --> 16:06.720
phase, separated by a semi-permeable, semi-conducting barrier.

16:06.720 --> 16:11.840
And those phases have hydrogen and CO2 and should be more reactive in those phases.

16:11.840 --> 16:14.200
So this is all we effectively need.

16:14.200 --> 16:18.240
It's not clear yet whether it's electrons crossing this barrier or protons coming the

16:18.240 --> 16:19.400
other way.

16:19.400 --> 16:23.080
But this is really just showing visually what I just did.

16:23.080 --> 16:29.080
We've got hydrogen on the alkaline side, passing electrons onto an ion-sulfide barrier.

16:29.080 --> 16:32.640
The protons react with hydroxide ions to form water.

16:32.640 --> 16:37.080
And on the acid side, we've got CO2 picking up protons and electrons from the barrier

16:37.080 --> 16:38.080
itself.

16:38.080 --> 16:39.960
So this, in principle, should work.

16:39.960 --> 16:41.760
It's very easy to set it up.

16:41.760 --> 16:42.760
Well, it's not so easy.

16:42.760 --> 16:44.400
But in principle, it's easy to set it up.

16:44.400 --> 16:48.880
This needs to be done inside a glove box, an anaerobic glove box.

16:48.880 --> 16:52.280
Oxygen, even trace amounts of oxygen, really do play around with this.

16:52.280 --> 16:55.320
We need to have it pretty strictly anoxic.

16:55.320 --> 16:59.160
This is a microfluidic chip with a barrier that's just spontaneously precipitated by laminar

16:59.160 --> 17:05.760
flow with sodium sulfide on one side and, sorry, sodium sulfide on one side, an ion

17:05.760 --> 17:07.520
chloride, ferrous chloride.

17:07.520 --> 17:11.680
On the other side, they spontaneously precipitate this barrier.

17:11.680 --> 17:17.160
And this is just one piece of evidence to show you.

17:17.160 --> 17:20.240
Formates is being formed, acetate also.

17:20.240 --> 17:22.040
So we'll be getting towards the Krebs cycle.

17:22.040 --> 17:26.480
We have seen pyruvate as well, but we've not managed to see it on every occasion yet.

17:26.480 --> 17:29.720
And possibly things like methanol as well.

17:29.720 --> 17:37.560
So this is stuff that I was hoping for when I last presented to you five or six years ago.

17:37.560 --> 17:42.880
But this is now, is being published in PNAS, and this is our own work, which is taking

17:42.880 --> 17:44.880
it a little bit further.

17:44.880 --> 17:51.120
So just to come back to this figure for a moment, if we are able to reduce CO2 to organics,

17:51.120 --> 17:55.280
then we think that they should include amino acids and lipids.

17:55.280 --> 17:58.720
The next step then would be to have some kind of protocell.

17:58.720 --> 18:04.120
We've taken a leap forward rather than, I mean, we are trying to make these lipids as

18:04.120 --> 18:05.120
well.

18:05.120 --> 18:06.120
We've not done so yet.

18:06.120 --> 18:10.400
But if we simply take lipids that other people have successfully synthesized under these

18:10.400 --> 18:16.880
kind of conditions, we're able to form vesicles under these alkaline hydrothermal conditions.

18:16.880 --> 18:23.840
This is another major step, because these vesicles are not supposed to be stable under

18:23.840 --> 18:25.600
these pretty harsh conditions.

18:25.600 --> 18:29.280
And the literature and our experiments as well show that if you have a very simple vesicle

18:29.280 --> 18:33.360
made from decanoic acid, it more or less falls to pieces as soon as you change the pH or

18:33.360 --> 18:34.800
the temperature or anything else.

18:34.800 --> 18:41.320
But if you have mixtures, slightly messy mixtures of fatty acids and long chain fatty alcohols

18:41.320 --> 18:45.800
and so on, especially if you have one-to-one mixtures of these.

18:45.800 --> 18:51.240
Then we get, you can see with cryoAM and you can see with thomphocal microscopy there,

18:51.240 --> 18:58.640
we are seeing vesicles at pH 12, 70 degrees centigrade, modern ocean salinity in the presence

18:58.640 --> 19:00.640
of calcium ions and magnesium ions.

19:00.640 --> 19:07.880
So we really are able to form from the kind of fatty acids that have been formed under

19:07.880 --> 19:11.480
hydrothermal conditions, you can make vesicles under those conditions.

19:11.480 --> 19:15.160
And this was another one I wanted to share with you very briefly.

19:15.160 --> 19:20.200
This is UV-Vis spectroscopy and it's showing a classical shoulder, which was the last thing

19:20.200 --> 19:26.000
we expected to see there, because that shoulder, when we mix the amino acid cysteine with sodium

19:26.000 --> 19:33.640
sulfide and iron chloride, and that's it in water, that shoulder is a 4FE4S cluster,

19:33.640 --> 19:38.120
the same thing that we see in ferrodoxin and which is responsible for a lot of CO2 fixation

19:38.120 --> 19:40.640
in bacteria today.

19:40.640 --> 19:43.800
And we've looked at different concentrations of everything, including the cysteine, we've

19:43.800 --> 19:49.720
used MOSpower spectroscopy to characterize the clusters, and we've used cyclic voltammetry

19:49.720 --> 19:55.200
to show their redox potential, and it's exactly the same as ferrodoxin.

19:55.200 --> 20:00.160
This is the midpoint reduction potential and it's about minus 450 millivolts, which is

20:00.160 --> 20:07.560
right in the region for reducing CO2, though we would not yet use them to reduce CO2.

20:07.560 --> 20:13.280
So it seems to be possible to make this machinery under surprisingly simple sets of conditions.

20:14.280 --> 20:19.360
So I'm going to say a little bit about metabolism, and again I'm going to skip likely over some

20:19.360 --> 20:24.040
data and then I'll finish with the code itself.

20:24.040 --> 20:30.440
So this is the core of metabolism, I've mentioned the Krebs cycle, this is not really the cycle

20:30.440 --> 20:36.600
so much as some of the steps, so acetyl-CoA or some equivalent to it, prebiotic equivalent,

20:36.600 --> 20:41.600
through to pyruvate, we're now into the Krebs cycle, oxaloacetate, alpha ketoglutarate and

20:41.600 --> 20:42.600
so on.

20:42.600 --> 20:46.680
What we really want you to notice here is this is CO2 at the top left, and in a kind

20:46.680 --> 20:51.400
of brownie red color we've got hydrogen, hydrogen, hydrogen, lots of hydrogen in there, in green

20:51.400 --> 20:56.800
we've got CO2, again there's CO2 everywhere that you look pretty much, this is the chemistry

20:56.800 --> 20:59.880
of hydrogen and CO2 and there's not much more to it.

20:59.880 --> 21:03.720
When we get amino acids we're beginning to see ammonia in there as well.

21:03.720 --> 21:10.280
The blue arrows here are basically experiments that have been done successfully under prebiotic

21:10.280 --> 21:15.120
conditions by us and by other people, there are several labs around the world doing this

21:15.120 --> 21:21.400
kind of chemistry and the red boxes are showing the precursors for nucleotide synthesis following

21:21.400 --> 21:25.600
the biological pathways as the starting point.

21:25.600 --> 21:28.720
So much of this chemistry has now been done.

21:28.720 --> 21:35.800
One of the things that has been missing from there is cysteine synthesis and we've recently,

21:35.800 --> 21:39.040
I mean this is about as much as we've got at the moment, it's not very much but this

21:39.040 --> 21:51.040
is a peak for cysteine on NMR, sorry that was on HPLC I beg your pardon, and it looks

21:51.040 --> 21:57.420
like we've managed to do a one pot synthesis of cysteine starting from glycine through

21:57.420 --> 22:05.720
cyrene to cysteine and we're also able to produce spartate and alanine under those kind

22:05.720 --> 22:06.720
of conditions.

22:07.000 --> 22:10.480
This is basically using life as a guide and a lot of these we've used pyrodoxamine which

22:10.480 --> 22:14.600
is a simple cofactor used by life and it's that which is catalyzing these reactions.

22:14.600 --> 22:19.160
So another problem then is can we make pyrodoxamine under these conditions?

22:19.160 --> 22:25.400
So there's always more questions that we've not answered yet but we can make the cysteine.

22:25.400 --> 22:26.800
That's not published yet.

22:26.800 --> 22:31.280
This is also uracil synthesis and again I'll skip very lightly over it but this is following

22:31.280 --> 22:36.200
the biological pathway starting with ammonia, carbonate and a spartate which I just mentioned

22:37.080 --> 22:44.920
we've synthesized and this goes through to uracil which is one of the bases in RNA and

22:44.920 --> 22:51.000
again this is a one pot synthesis starting over here and we've made both oratate and

22:51.000 --> 22:56.120
uracil that way and when we just do these last few steps going from dihydro oratate

22:56.120 --> 23:02.280
to uracil and we try to optimize them so we looked at a panel of different metal ions,

23:02.280 --> 23:07.320
we looked at different pHs, we looked at different temperatures, different salinities

23:07.320 --> 23:11.200
and things like that and worked out what the optimal conditions were.

23:11.200 --> 23:18.040
It turned out those optimal conditions are about 90 degrees centigrade, pH 9, high pressure,

23:18.040 --> 23:24.320
100 bars pressure, modern ocean salinity so that was very gratifying and this at the right

23:24.320 --> 23:28.760
hand side here is showing those optimal conditions, uracil synthesis when we when we matched up

23:28.760 --> 23:34.120
the optimal conditions apart from that's not high pressure that's just atmospheric pressure

23:34.120 --> 23:38.280
so that was an eight-fold increase in yield when we optimized those conditions.

23:39.320 --> 23:44.600
Whoops that just hopped forward this is the last thing I'll say about metabolism but I mentioned

23:44.600 --> 23:52.280
ATP a couple of times it's now produced by this amazing rotating nanomotor the ATP synthase

23:52.840 --> 23:57.160
that's obviously a product of genes and natural selection and must have come later but then the

23:57.160 --> 24:02.120
question is so why did ATP become the universal energy currency and this is

24:03.160 --> 24:09.160
this is some beautiful work from a former PhD student of mine Silvana Pinna who showed that

24:10.440 --> 24:18.680
mildly acidic pH in this case and at 30 or 50 degrees centigrade in water starting with acetyl

24:18.680 --> 24:24.920
phosphate and ferric iron and ADP the acetyl phosphate will phosphorylate ADP to ATP at around

24:24.920 --> 24:32.680
15 to 20 yield just in in water and she tried a whole range of other phosphorylating agents and

24:32.680 --> 24:39.080
none of them really worked carbonyl phosphate worked a little bit, cyclic TMP worked a little bit

24:39.080 --> 24:44.920
but basically acetyl phosphate does that job beautifully and interestingly still does that

24:44.920 --> 24:51.800
job today in bacteria and archaea but the the other beautiful thing about this was it works with ATP

24:51.800 --> 24:56.840
but it doesn't work with any of the other nuclear bases in other words we can make ATP but we can't

24:56.840 --> 25:05.560
make CTP or UTP or ITP or GTP and so on um so why is ATP the universal energy currency the answer

25:05.560 --> 25:12.440
seems to be because you can make it fairly easily with minimum um minimum catalytic requirements

25:12.440 --> 25:19.240
and simply acetyl phosphate which is a two carbon phosphorylating agent in water at reasonable

25:19.240 --> 25:27.640
temperatures and pressures and so on so that's by no means does that say that's why ATP is

25:27.640 --> 25:31.960
the universal energy currency but it's certainly almost uncanny that that we can make that and

25:31.960 --> 25:38.280
nothing else under those conditions so for the last five minutes or so I'd like to touch on

25:38.280 --> 25:44.600
information and this is some of the most beautiful work that I have been involved in in the last few

25:44.600 --> 25:51.480
years and I should say that these ideas came from Stuart Harrison who did his PhD in my lab and is

25:51.480 --> 25:57.640
now doing a postdoc job with me and so this is actually I'm used to thinking and and I'm not

25:57.640 --> 26:02.680
used to my PhD students and postdoc coming up with the best ideas and this is what's happened

26:02.680 --> 26:09.000
on this occasion so it's very pleasing actually in in many respects this is metabolism again

26:09.000 --> 26:15.160
as we've seen it starting with CO2 coming through into pyruvate oxaloacetate and so on

26:16.040 --> 26:22.760
and in the the colors lozenges are the amino acids and they're color coded according to

26:24.200 --> 26:33.000
the first base of the codon that encodes them in DNA or in RNA and so glycine alanine aspartate

26:33.000 --> 26:38.840
and glutamate are all encoded by a gene at the first position as well where it makes sense

26:39.800 --> 26:44.440
yeah get that get that awareness and build that picture yeah I was going to go to the foundry

26:44.440 --> 26:48.600
ones as well though I don't really like it's quite like I'm not going to go to the deep dive I'm

26:48.600 --> 26:52.280
probably going to go to the overview because I feel like that'd be more like able for me I think the

26:52.280 --> 26:57.880
deep dive will be a bit too technical for me it's probably going to be more at the practitioner

26:58.360 --> 27:02.440
I think you'll get a good sense at the high level one from what they've been what they've talked

27:02.440 --> 27:06.120
about so that they did good to get immersed in that yeah

27:11.800 --> 27:12.680
no they're not gone

27:14.920 --> 27:15.720
shall I continue

27:15.720 --> 27:28.280
okay I'll I'll continue so can you hear me okay

27:29.800 --> 27:36.840
yes I think we can yes good so so in gray then it's G at the first position of the codon

27:36.840 --> 27:41.800
and then in yellow it's an A at the first position of the codon and then in blue it's a C

27:41.800 --> 27:48.680
side to dean and in green it's a U at the first position of the codon so there's plainly patterning

27:48.680 --> 27:55.400
there and it seems to link to the distance from co2 fixation and at the bottom right there that's

27:55.400 --> 28:02.600
just showing exactly that distance the number of steps from co2 fixation what exactly this tells us

28:02.600 --> 28:09.720
is not entirely clear but it seems to it seems to suggest that the the organization of the code or

28:09.720 --> 28:16.600
the first letter of the codon is linked in some way to the pattern of metabolism we do have ideas

28:16.600 --> 28:20.120
about why that might be and we can talk about it afterwards but I'll just leave it that there's

28:20.120 --> 28:27.080
clearly a pattern there and that patterns an interesting one if we then so what we're seeing

28:27.080 --> 28:36.680
here is the is is the hydrophobicity of of the amino acid in relation to the second letter of

28:36.680 --> 28:42.200
the anti codon and we're arranging them in boxes with G at the first position of the codon then A

28:42.200 --> 28:47.960
then C then then U as we had before and all I really want you to take away from this is there's a

28:47.960 --> 28:55.320
clear relationship that A is the most hydrophobic amino acid and V is the most hydrophobic base

28:55.960 --> 29:01.880
so this is there is a relationship between the hydrophobicity of the base and the hydrophobicity

29:01.880 --> 29:07.880
of the amino acid that it codes for and at the other end of this one it's spartate and that is

29:07.880 --> 29:14.040
encoded by a U which is the most hydrophilic of the basis so there's a clear patterning there

29:14.040 --> 29:18.680
especially if there's a purine at the first position a gRNA at the first position we see

29:18.680 --> 29:24.120
quite a strong relationship with where there's a pyrimidine at the first position and that's less

29:24.120 --> 29:29.560
of a strong relationship but it's not gone away completely so again all I really want you to take

29:29.560 --> 29:35.880
away from it is there are patterns in the code that depend on the bio on the hydrophobicity

29:35.880 --> 29:41.800
of the amino acids and the bases which suggest direct stereochemical interactions between them

29:42.520 --> 29:48.600
this kind of thing has been known for a long time but the patterning is stronger when we set it out

29:48.600 --> 29:54.760
around an autotrophic protometabolism and this is the third position and again only a couple of

29:54.760 --> 29:59.560
things I really want you to notice here but this is an inverted codon table which is to say

30:00.440 --> 30:06.600
these are the amino acids that are coded in the outermost ring this is the first position

30:06.600 --> 30:11.400
of the codon and the second position of the codon and then the third position of the codon

30:11.400 --> 30:17.960
in the in the most part there so just to give one example here we have glutamate and a spartate

30:18.920 --> 30:23.080
and they both have a g at the first position they both have an a at the second position

30:23.640 --> 30:31.000
but glutamate has a purine at the third position of the codon whereas a spartate has a pyrimidine

30:31.000 --> 30:36.760
at the third position of the codon and what we see if we if we now switch this to the

30:36.760 --> 30:44.680
anticodon not the codon what we find is that if there's effectively a big bulky base a purine

30:44.680 --> 30:50.280
rather than the pyrimidine at the third position then we'll always see the smallest amino acid

30:50.280 --> 30:54.360
so this is the size of the amino acids that could be coded for there and we always see

30:55.080 --> 30:59.800
that the when there's a larger base there's a smaller amino acid so again it just suggests

30:59.800 --> 31:06.840
that there's direct interactions between the chemistry of the amino acids its hydrophobicity

31:06.840 --> 31:14.440
and so on and its size so all of this is very suggestive but there's no doubt various ways

31:14.440 --> 31:18.680
in which it could be interpreted and so this is the last slide then and this is work which is

31:19.240 --> 31:24.680
should be published in the next week or two I hope and this is doing a mixture of molecular

31:24.680 --> 31:30.760
dynamic simulations so all in silico and some NMR work which which is ongoing but these are the

31:30.760 --> 31:37.240
first four that way and what we're seeing here this is basically the proportion of time spent

31:37.240 --> 31:44.440
the amino acid spends in the vicinity of specific bases these are mononutriotides so AMP, CMP,

31:44.440 --> 31:51.160
GMP or UMP and you can this is proline in this particular case and what you're seeing is that

31:51.160 --> 31:58.200
it spends much more time within two angstroms of GMP than anything else there is a direct

31:59.000 --> 32:04.440
predicted interaction between proline and GMP which happens to be the base that codes for it

32:04.440 --> 32:09.240
at the second position of the anticodal we see something a little bit similar underneath for

32:09.240 --> 32:13.640
a spartate but this is much muddier in that case it tends to spend quite a lot of time

32:13.640 --> 32:22.760
with almost everything but in that case it's also I think it's GMP is slightly better.

32:22.760 --> 32:28.760
What we're seeing in effect is we can predict 50% of the of the middle bases of the anticodons that

32:28.760 --> 32:34.120
way we're much better at predicting this is all the amino acids across the bottom here and it's

32:34.120 --> 32:38.520
on a scale going from hydrophobic at the left hand end to hydrophilic at the right hand end

32:38.520 --> 32:42.680
and we can get the hydrophilic interactions pretty well the hydrophobic interactions this

32:42.680 --> 32:48.920
method is much less good at predicting correctly the hydrophobic interactions but still we are

32:48.920 --> 32:54.360
we're better than 99% of random allocations if we simply assume that there were random

32:54.360 --> 33:02.040
interactions our predictions are better than 99% and we also when we do NMR work and we're looking

33:02.040 --> 33:07.560
at the binding constants for these it's again it's easier to work with hydrophilic amino acids

33:07.560 --> 33:12.760
because you can get higher concentrations in water it's it's more fiddly trying to do it with

33:12.760 --> 33:18.680
hydrophobic bases and hydrophobic amino acids in water but we're seeing that essentially the same

33:18.680 --> 33:26.680
patterns so we are I would take this as broad confirmation that there really are weak but

33:26.680 --> 33:37.240
statistically systematic interactions between amino acids and the bases that code for them in

33:37.240 --> 33:41.480
the genetic code and so that picture that I showed you at the beginning suggesting that there can be

33:41.480 --> 33:46.360
some kind of templating or non-random templating that if you've got a random stretch of RNA you will

33:46.360 --> 33:54.200
get a non-random peptide which is interacting with it that seems to be borne out in other words as I

33:54.200 --> 33:59.400
said at the beginning there should be no problem with information at the origin of the code that's

33:59.400 --> 34:03.720
all I'm going to say I just want to have a final call out to the people who've been doing this work

34:04.280 --> 34:08.760
this is over of some years now I just like this picture because they're holding up the

34:08.760 --> 34:14.920
reverse Krebs cycle there this was a birthday present they did a few years ago and I like

34:14.920 --> 34:19.640
it too much too so a few of these people have left the group now but I still keep this image

34:20.200 --> 34:23.880
but they are the people who've really been doing all this experimental work that I've

34:23.880 --> 34:29.000
talked about and that's it so I will stop sharing and I look forward to your questions.

34:29.800 --> 34:41.480
Well thank you Nick that was that that was quite a tour de force so thank you and I'm not sure we

34:41.480 --> 34:50.760
have many questions yet in the chat box so we had a bit of an interruption there in the sound I'm

34:50.760 --> 34:56.040
not sure quite what happened there yeah sorry I apologize for that Alan I had a cup of tea delivered

34:56.040 --> 35:05.240
oh sorry okay anyway okay it's audience's chance to to fire away with some questions from from

35:06.600 --> 35:15.160
for Nick if you'd like to unmute yourself and put your video on and wave your hands we can

35:16.440 --> 35:25.240
some questions don't be shy. Can I maybe start with one Nick you kind of touched on the thermodynamics

35:25.240 --> 35:30.280
so how much of how much of this is a thermodynamic process alongside the chemistry?

35:31.480 --> 35:37.000
I think it's predominantly thermodynamic in the sense that what we're dealing with is an environment

35:38.680 --> 35:45.720
which is continuously out of equilibrium because we have continuous flow of hydrothermal fluids

35:45.720 --> 35:52.040
which are rich in hydrogen in the modern vents that it's up to about 15 millimolar equivalent

35:52.120 --> 35:57.800
hydrogen and CO2 and in the early oceans we don't know what it was exactly but but you know

35:57.800 --> 36:04.840
potentially more than a bar of CO2 back then so the modern systems are somewhat carbon starved

36:04.840 --> 36:10.120
because they're alkaline and it precipitates out carbonate but but in in the older systems there

36:10.120 --> 36:17.240
would have been an overwhelming amount of CO2 there and so thermodynamically it is it's it's

36:17.240 --> 36:24.360
exegonic to be producing pretty much all of all of the biomolecules um it's it's simply an exothermic

36:24.360 --> 36:34.360
reaction. So then it's down to the catalyst. Yeah so and we have a few hands up with a couple of

36:34.360 --> 36:39.640
hands up there's one there from from Victor Victor would you like to unmute yourself and ask your

36:39.640 --> 36:47.720
question okay i'm up can you hear me yeah okay yep i had a question which might not be as knowledgeable

36:47.720 --> 36:55.560
as some of the other people's questions are in in this session um so you've you've looked at the

36:55.560 --> 37:01.080
life that we have and the building blocks that build up that life and kind of working backwards to

37:02.280 --> 37:07.960
some simple conditions where those building blocks might have might have had their origin

37:08.760 --> 37:14.600
um is there another form of life that could have developed rather than the one that we've got or

37:14.600 --> 37:20.520
maybe it did develop at certain stages and then it it it died out for some reason it wasn't as

37:20.520 --> 37:27.400
successful um in terms of the changing conditions on the planet from when life first formed it may

37:27.400 --> 37:32.120
not have had any longevity associated with it is there's some other thing that we could have

37:32.760 --> 37:38.520
and that would have ended up with something completely different potentially yes uh and it

37:38.520 --> 37:45.080
is uh it's a very good question and it's one which keeps me awake at night i think but uh but it's um

37:46.840 --> 37:54.280
there's to my mind there's something a little bit uncanny about all of this metabolic biochemistry

37:54.280 --> 37:59.720
just happening in the absence of genes and information and and some of it i can understand

38:00.360 --> 38:05.320
but the further we get from co2 fixation the more unbelievable it seems to be that's uh

38:05.320 --> 38:09.640
that impure in synthesis or well permadein synthesis as we're working on purine synthesis

38:09.640 --> 38:17.560
and it's well that's a bit hard work um but um we tend that you think there's all these side

38:17.560 --> 38:23.720
reactions that could happen and should happen uh and to a larger extent don't happen what we tend to see

38:23.720 --> 38:31.560
is is small amounts of the intermediates along these known metabolic pathways forming spontaneously

38:31.560 --> 38:40.840
and interchanging between themselves at low low levels um and why why those ones why not other

38:40.840 --> 38:45.320
ones this is the the essence of your question and i think a lot will depend on the starting point

38:45.320 --> 38:49.400
which is to say if we're starting with hydrogen and co2 at a particular temperature

38:49.400 --> 38:54.440
we're likely to get a certain metabolic network if you like and if we change the starting point

38:54.440 --> 38:58.200
to something else or we change the temperature or we change any of those parameters then easily you

38:58.200 --> 39:07.720
could get a different network um so so why this network um it still seems uncanny but if you think

39:07.720 --> 39:11.880
about what the genes would be doing then as soon as we introduce information into this system there

39:11.880 --> 39:18.520
is a serious problem here which has been largely overlooked in my view uh about um how

39:19.960 --> 39:28.040
an RNA world invents metabolism which is the standard view but but but the the RNA world of

39:28.040 --> 39:32.440
people have really got as far as trying to replicate RNA and haven't really worried themselves very

39:32.440 --> 39:37.800
much yet about how how you know as soon as you got something which is capable of self replicating

39:37.800 --> 39:43.320
then you've got a system which is capable of evolution and and and it's easy lazy to put it

39:43.320 --> 39:49.240
aside there and say okay so it'll evolve there is no conceptual problem but there is a conceptual

39:49.240 --> 39:55.240
problem to my mind because if you invent one enzyme that catalyzes one step in a metabolic pathway

39:55.240 --> 40:00.040
and there's 10 steps in that pathway then it's absolutely no use to you you really need all 10

40:00.760 --> 40:07.320
enzymes in that pathway and and so it's beginning to look less probable but and what what use is one

40:07.320 --> 40:13.880
pathway you actually need multiple pathways to have anything that's any use to you so a more

40:14.680 --> 40:20.520
rigorous way of thinking about what's actually what entity is being selected and what are the

40:20.520 --> 40:26.840
reasons it's being selected uh you're left facing quite a large part of proto metabolism needs to

40:26.840 --> 40:33.640
be doing it to produce the required amino acids nucleotide sugars whatever else is is required

40:33.640 --> 40:40.520
to to have a system which is capable of replicating itself um and and again the the problem is still

40:41.240 --> 40:47.080
there's no point in having any one of those pathways by itself um or at least there's no

40:47.080 --> 40:53.800
obvious point that I can see um so there's a there's a serious combinatorial problem there

40:54.840 --> 41:00.760
that's never been seriously addressed and I suspect it's borderline impossibly difficult

41:02.280 --> 41:07.800
but if what actually you see instead is a kind of a spontaneous proto metabolism that happens to

41:07.800 --> 41:13.960
have a particular network structure to it and what the first genes do is increase flux through

41:13.960 --> 41:21.560
that pathway for example by steepening the driving force so increasing the fixation of CO2 to make

41:21.560 --> 41:25.480
the first intermediates in that pathway then you get increased flux through the entire network so

41:25.480 --> 41:30.760
that's not intrinsically very difficult what that says then if you take a step back is that what the

41:30.760 --> 41:35.880
first genes are doing is amplifying the network and so the fact that we get the same network and

41:35.880 --> 41:40.200
the entire thing is amplified is in fact a direct prediction of assuming that network comes first

41:41.880 --> 41:47.880
in which case we should be able to turn that on its head and say okay well if if we can look at the

41:47.880 --> 41:51.960
conditions that give rise to that entire network then we should be able to predict the you know

41:51.960 --> 41:55.880
if we can get the entire network under this set of conditions but not that set then we might be able

41:55.880 --> 42:04.200
to say the conditions under which life arose well that's very good thank you okay thank you for that

42:04.200 --> 42:10.920
Nick we have another question from Chelsea Chen could you unmute yourself please Chelsea and

42:10.920 --> 42:18.680
if you want to put your video on we can see you too perhaps. Hello can I just ask about why ATP

42:19.800 --> 42:27.720
can be spontaneously synthesized in water while other nucleosides can't? Yes you can ask

42:28.440 --> 42:35.400
I'd like to say I could answer we did we did some molecular dynamic simulations on that

42:37.160 --> 42:42.920
and it seems to be in part to do with the with the charge density on ferric iron,

42:42.920 --> 42:47.880
ferric iron was necessary and other other other other metal ions did not work in the same way,

42:47.880 --> 42:55.560
it seems to be partly to do with the actual orientation of the phosphate group of acetyl

42:55.560 --> 43:01.880
phosphates in relation to the ferric iron and the ADP tail I mean we came up with a potential

43:01.880 --> 43:05.960
explanation for the orientation some of it seems to be to do with the way that the ring

43:05.960 --> 43:11.400
nitrogen's interact with ferric iron and I don't understand that very well but they interact very

43:11.400 --> 43:20.040
differently with say guanine compared to adenosine so why I'm not quite sure but the prediction is

43:20.040 --> 43:26.200
that you know molecular dynamic prediction is that you do not have the orientation of the acetyl

43:26.200 --> 43:31.080
phosphate in the right place and and it tends to abstract the catalyst it abstracts the ferric

43:31.080 --> 43:36.280
iron which interacts with the nitrogen on the ring instead so we have some answers but I'm not

43:36.280 --> 43:40.360
persuaded that they're the right answers or that the molecular dynamic simulations are

43:42.840 --> 43:49.080
real I don't know enough of what's going on under the bonnet with them with the atomic forces that

43:49.160 --> 43:57.320
they're predicting I am not a chemist I'm a biochemist and and you know I try to get my hands

43:57.320 --> 44:02.040
dirty with all of this stuff but it's I think we need a proper chemist to look at some of that

44:03.720 --> 44:10.360
okay thank you thanks we have a question from Jim Cunningham on this chat box there

44:11.640 --> 44:17.480
Nick can you see that uh oh he's asking when when when will the book come out about all this

44:17.480 --> 44:25.080
it takes more than 45 minutes to digest at all well I I am trying to put together a proposal

44:25.080 --> 44:29.480
now to write a book on the origin of life specifically covering more or less what I've

44:29.480 --> 44:36.600
said today but it will be some years before it's written I mean we're not I'm neither chemist

44:36.600 --> 44:44.200
nor biochemist so I do have a book that was out last year that touches on some of the actual

44:44.200 --> 44:48.920
chemistry of the Krebs cycle and some of the ideas I've just talked about now so that's out

44:48.920 --> 44:56.360
already but the genetic code stuff is quite new um and I'm I'm quite excited by it but

44:57.800 --> 45:03.560
the path going from a pattern to a predicted set of steps that we can then test that uh

45:03.560 --> 45:07.800
I I want to delay writing the book until we've done some of that and I have something to say about

45:08.520 --> 45:20.040
hmm these these steps you're predicting they seem to depend uh on specifically specific

45:20.040 --> 45:25.880
earth conditions but perhaps earth-like conditions um what they

45:28.360 --> 45:35.320
yes they they I mean what we would get from this metabolic network is a specific set of amino acids

45:36.280 --> 45:40.600
and we would tend to get those amino acids and we would tend to we would predict an order in

45:40.600 --> 45:48.360
which we get them as well um the extent to which we would expect to see exactly the four bases

45:48.360 --> 45:54.040
that we see in RNA compared to a bunch of other possible ones that are and there's a lot of modified

45:54.040 --> 46:01.160
bases around um I'm less sure about that so one thing we want to do is is model metabolism

46:02.120 --> 46:07.240
where we're varying the thermodynamic parameters and kinetic parameters on each of the but

46:07.240 --> 46:11.480
basically it's more the thermodynamics than the kinetics what's the likelihood of each reaction

46:11.480 --> 46:19.400
happening and given that we have no clear idea no clear data under the sets of conditions that

46:19.400 --> 46:24.440
we might be thinking about if we if we model it we can vary across orders of magnitude and obviously

46:24.440 --> 46:29.160
if you make an oxidation reaction more likely then a reduction step is less likely and so on so we

46:29.160 --> 46:35.960
can we can we can vary parameters um in relation to each other and try to see how much of of

46:35.960 --> 46:43.800
metabolism we actually recover and do we recover then the the core of it in which case we would

46:43.800 --> 46:49.000
expect to see exactly the same interaction somewhere else in which case if we discovered life on Mars

46:49.000 --> 46:54.120
and it has exactly the same genetic code then it doesn't prove that it was a contamination

46:54.840 --> 47:01.960
um or it may be that it's much looser than that and that um that if you know if effectively

47:02.600 --> 47:07.640
we would expect to see some but not all or or or it's very contingent on which bases you produce

47:07.640 --> 47:13.240
and which ones get incorporated into RNA or DNA uh then that would come up with a different set

47:13.240 --> 47:18.360
of predictions there's a lot that we don't know or I don't know um but but there's a lot you know

47:18.440 --> 47:24.920
there's a huge amount that can be done here so yeah could could I could I ask a quick supplementary

47:24.920 --> 47:31.400
on that please nick um you've been talking about the the bases you find in in RNA and you mentioned

47:31.400 --> 47:39.720
uracil yes as I recall in in in DNA we've got cytosine, uranine, alanine and thymine have we not

47:39.720 --> 47:46.920
do we know do we know why thymine came along as opposed to uracil in DNA um I mean there are ideas

47:46.920 --> 47:56.760
out there um and it's partly to do with stability um and and and decreasing the risk of mutations

47:56.760 --> 48:03.800
because if I'm probably going to get this wrong I can't quite remember but um if if if there is a

48:04.360 --> 48:10.120
I think an oxidation of uracil then uh you end up with producing something very similar to one

48:10.120 --> 48:17.640
of the other bases uh I need to double check that uh in other words there there's more scope for

48:18.440 --> 48:31.960
um for I suppose confusion replacing the wrong base so so that'd be part of it in part um RNA

48:31.960 --> 48:37.480
does not tend to form structures as stable as DNA and I'm not sure that's to do with the bases

48:37.480 --> 48:47.560
so much as to do with the deoxy versus ribose um but I I don't we've not really started thinking

48:47.560 --> 48:52.280
very much about DNA yet it's plain that as soon as you've got DNA you've got a much larger much

48:52.280 --> 48:58.360
more stable structure which is going to lower the error error error rate um but uh that's another

48:58.360 --> 49:03.800
another reason I want to delay writing a book on this until I until I figure it out how does DNA

49:03.960 --> 49:09.400
how does that fit into this picture right well please don't delay it too long

49:10.360 --> 49:16.920
like to read it um now then Chelsea Chen has had a supplementary right if she's still around

49:16.920 --> 49:24.760
she's welcome to read otherwise I'll read it out are you there Chelsea yes do you want to go ahead

49:24.760 --> 49:32.040
with your supplementary about purely RNA compounds uh sorry this is not no longer Chelsea Chen but

49:32.040 --> 49:42.440
but it's the same question do one yes do we know do we know if there is uh if there are any RNA

49:42.440 --> 49:48.280
purely RNA compounds that are capable of catalyzing reactions such as uh condensing uh condensing

49:48.280 --> 49:56.040
amino acids or or nucleotides um well I mean there there's been a lot of interest over decades in

49:56.040 --> 50:02.920
what's called the RNA world and there are plenty of ribosomes which are basically catalysts a bit

50:02.920 --> 50:09.720
like an enzyme enzymes are made of proteins and ribosomes are made of RNA and RNA will tend to

50:09.720 --> 50:16.680
form into interesting shapes and knots and has quite a wide range of catalytic functions much

50:16.680 --> 50:24.360
less than proteins but but but certainly um you know capable of catalyzing quite complex chemistry

50:25.000 --> 50:28.680
and so this has been the basis for what's being called the RNA world hypothesis

50:30.440 --> 50:36.120
and that really goes back to to people like Leslie Orgel in the 1960s in the late 1960s

50:36.840 --> 50:41.000
and it the ideas are very simple and very appealing which is more or less that

50:41.560 --> 50:47.720
because of complementary base pairing it's it's you know conceptually very easy for an RNA to make

50:47.720 --> 50:53.640
a copy of itself whereas for a peptide to make a copy of itself is much more problematic and complex

50:53.720 --> 50:59.880
and and difficult um so if you were to say which comes first then RNA has to come before

50:59.880 --> 51:06.840
peptides in that sense at least as a hereditary mechanism um but what that has tended to lead

51:06.840 --> 51:12.680
to is a rather purest view of an RNA world where as I said RNA invents everything else it invents

51:12.680 --> 51:18.280
all of metabolism and that view has been I would say receding over the last five to ten years or so

51:18.280 --> 51:22.600
with a kind of recognition that chemistry is dirtier than that and that there will be other

51:22.600 --> 51:26.360
things in there there will be lipids in there there will be amino acids maybe peptides in there

51:26.360 --> 51:32.600
and we've we've got a kind of a dirty RNA world so there's no question that RNA is central to all

51:32.600 --> 51:39.880
of this um and that's that this was almost only the first code and it's interesting that the ribosome

51:40.440 --> 51:46.920
which is the big protein building factories in cells they're basically ribosomes um the the

51:47.640 --> 51:52.520
the RNA content is very high and as far as I'm aware it's the ribosomes that are doing

51:52.600 --> 51:59.880
most of the catalysis of peptide bond formation um so so it's interesting that they have an

51:59.880 --> 52:03.960
absolutely central critical job and this is one thing that we're trying to think our way through

52:03.960 --> 52:08.920
to and do some experiments on as well but this is a highly populated area you may say because it's

52:09.480 --> 52:13.880
it's so central to the question people have been working on it a lot for a long time um

52:13.880 --> 52:22.440
um ironically RNA does not copy itself in cells and this this kind of holy grail of having a

52:22.440 --> 52:28.040
ribosome that will copy itself which was the the essence of the RNA world actually the it's an

52:28.040 --> 52:33.960
enzyme that does that job it's the RNA polymerase it's a magnesium dependent protein um and so

52:33.960 --> 52:43.240
there's this this interesting um RNA effectively copies proteins and proteins copy RNA so we're

52:43.240 --> 52:49.720
back in this strange chicken and egg situation that uh that that is not easily unscrambled um

52:49.720 --> 52:53.720
I've forgotten exactly what your question was but essentially could how much work does RNA do

52:53.720 --> 52:58.760
and the answer is it's very central to a lot of this um but it it's not the only thing that's going

52:58.760 --> 53:07.480
on uh and I think peptides early are are pretty necessary. Nick that's been a very stimulating

53:08.440 --> 53:16.280
afternoon thank you so much um before we go um you you you've clearly got a collection of your

53:16.280 --> 53:21.720
fans here in the audience would you like just to say give a quick a quick commercial for the

53:21.720 --> 53:26.920
other book that you have written very recently the one on trans you call transformers. Oh that's

53:26.920 --> 53:35.400
very kind of you yes why not I'm not sure that I'm not sure I would be intellectually fair of me to

53:35.880 --> 53:40.840
over plug it because it's it's a book on the Krebs cycle uh which is not to everybody's taste

53:40.840 --> 53:47.960
right on it attempts to link the chemistry that I touched on on the origin of life which is which

53:47.960 --> 53:54.680
is making Krebs cycle intermediates from CO2 and hydrogen but I have I have another lab group at

53:54.680 --> 54:00.040
UCL which is working on mitochondrial functions so still and energetics and so on right and it

54:00.040 --> 54:03.800
turned out both groups were measuring Krebs cycle intermediates for most of their lives so

54:04.520 --> 54:10.280
I had to put two and two together um and and you know the the Krebs cycle goes into reverse in

54:10.280 --> 54:16.120
cancer for example and it's it's certainly um and then what's it doing well it's driving cells

54:16.120 --> 54:20.600
copying themselves it's instead of being about energy it's about making the building blocks

54:20.600 --> 54:25.800
required to make a new cancer cell so all of the lipids all of the DNA and and so on that's required

54:26.600 --> 54:33.000
so metabolism the central cycle in metabolism is central right across the whole spectrum of life

54:33.000 --> 54:39.400
from the origin of life up to um to aging and cancer and I there's an epilogue where I have a

54:39.400 --> 54:46.200
go at linking it to consciousness as well which is beyond most people's tolerance for speculation

54:46.200 --> 54:50.520
in science but that's where I finished with the book so that's my plug for the book but if you

54:50.520 --> 54:56.360
don't like metabolic biochemistry then then then you may prefer just to watch a short talk online

54:56.360 --> 55:02.360
or something right okay well thank you so much right well we've had a wonderful afternoon

55:03.080 --> 55:09.000
which I've hugely enjoyed and I'm sure everybody else has so without a do I apart from thanking you

55:09.000 --> 55:16.840
again I'd like to pass over to our chairman uh professor David Southwood if I don't have his

55:16.840 --> 55:24.920
screen up in front of me but uh David over to you if I may thank you Ellen and Nick thank you very

55:24.920 --> 55:35.080
much for an invigorating afternoon um origin of life I think how can how can we not be interested

55:35.080 --> 55:44.440
in it and how can we not feel some of the emotions that you clearly feel the curiosity of it the um

55:45.320 --> 55:51.720
the fact that things have come out of it and yet there we are it's one of the big mysteries that

55:51.720 --> 55:58.920
we live with as human beings in my view so I really think you've taken us on a wonderful voyage

55:58.920 --> 56:07.480
and your enthusiasm is absolutely magnificent I think we'll need to communicate I much admire

56:08.120 --> 56:15.880
and um so I think if I can ask people generally to unmute or to use the symbol for clapping

56:15.880 --> 56:26.040
to give you a sign that we really did appreciate your time this time this afternoon so thank you very much
