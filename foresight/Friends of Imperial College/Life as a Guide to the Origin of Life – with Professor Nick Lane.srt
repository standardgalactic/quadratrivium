1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,840
This is a question I've been working on for a long time now, and the last few years have

2
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:16,600
become, I would say, really quite exciting, and the central ideas have become more crystallized

3
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:21,840
in my mind than they had been before, and it's very much about using life as a guide

4
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:28,280
to the origin of life, which immediately sounds like it's tautologous in some way, that

5
00:00:28,280 --> 00:00:36,000
it's, I could call it turtles all the way down, it seems as if there's an infinite regress

6
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:43,360
involved in that, but it begs the question, how can we possibly know what the answer is?

7
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:47,360
And if you take it almost literally and say, imagine that we had a time machine and we

8
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:53,920
go back to some time around the origin of life, what would we actually look for?

9
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:58,480
And the answer is, well, we would have no idea if we found some kind of green slime

10
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:03,720
or something, we wouldn't really know, was this the origin of life, was this just some

11
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:10,280
slime, was it on the path towards life, was it a failed experiment?

12
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:15,520
Actually what we really need to know, what we really need to have is a framework, a rigorous

13
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:21,240
intellectual framework which shows how a sterile non-living planet can give rise to

14
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:25,360
a living planet and we need to know what all the predicted steps would be along that

15
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:32,840
path and then how to test for them to see whether or not they actually have any substance

16
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:34,800
in them or not.

17
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:39,080
And so we'll never know how life started on Earth because it's a historical question

18
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:43,480
and we can't go back and if we did go back, as I say, we still wouldn't actually see what

19
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:44,560
the answer was.

20
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:50,520
What we need is this rigorous framework and that's where I think life as a guide comes

21
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:58,040
in because there is a spectrum and that spectrum starts somewhere almost unknowable, but let's

22
00:01:58,040 --> 00:02:02,720
assume for the sake of argument that it was on the early Earth and that it was in Earth-like

23
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:10,240
conditions rather than in outer space somewhere or, you know, panspermia may have happened,

24
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:13,520
however, it tells us nothing about the conditions under which life can start.

25
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:18,200
So it's an assumption that life started on Earth and we know the other end of the continuum,

26
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:22,320
the other end of this continuum is life itself, cells like bacterial cells that have a genetic

27
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:28,360
code that have DNA and RNA and proteins and membranes and everything else we know about

28
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:29,600
cells.

29
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:33,120
So we know one end of the continuum and all we need to do is figure out the other end

30
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:36,200
and how to join it up.

31
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:42,520
Now what I'll argue very briefly then is that life is an extremely good guide to its own

32
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:45,040
origin and I'm going to break it into three sections.

33
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:49,360
One is energy, the second is metabolism, and the third is genetic information.

34
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:52,240
So I will try and address all three today.

35
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:59,000
Before I get going, I'm going to just orientate you with a few slides about what I mean by

36
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,440
energy and so on.

37
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:05,960
So this is, you could imagine it as a bacterial cell or you could see it as the mitochondria

38
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:10,840
in our own cells, but effectively what we're seeing here inside this lozenge-shaped thing,

39
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:18,120
if that is a cell, I'm showing it respiring and respiration is effectively taking something

40
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:22,840
like glucose, breaking it down through the Krebs cycle, and the Krebs cycle, you don't

41
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:24,160
need to know what it is.

42
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:31,720
All it's really doing is stripping CO2 and hydrogen out of food, out of any organic molecules.

43
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:43,400
Now the CO2 is a waste product which we simply breathe out, and the hydrogen is not in the

44
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:48,800
form of hydrogen, it's in the form of NADH in our own cells, but it's basically two

45
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:50,400
hydrogen atoms.

46
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:57,320
They are being split for physicists, we're going to get somewhere in the vicinity of

47
00:03:57,320 --> 00:04:02,200
fundamental particles, so it's basically electrons and protons.

48
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:09,600
The electrons are passed to oxygen in the membrane, so it has effectively a current

49
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:14,920
of electrons within an insulating membrane through redox centers in that membrane, and

50
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:19,280
the current of electrons powers the extrusion of protons across the membrane, which is

51
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:25,840
what I'm showing, let me just get a pointer up on here.

52
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:29,720
So we have a charge on the membrane, the protons are positively charged of course,

53
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:35,280
and so we have a relatively positive charge on the outside of the membrane, relatively

54
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:38,520
negative inside, and that's known as the proton motive force.

55
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:44,560
It drives for example ATP synthesis, but it basically drives all work in cells, and that's

56
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:45,560
all we need to know.

57
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:49,920
We can put ATP aside for the time being and just think of we have an electrically charged

58
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:55,560
membrane that drives powers work in cells, and that I think is the fundamental thing

59
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:56,680
that we need to explain.

60
00:04:56,680 --> 00:05:04,120
Why is it that cells work by having an electrical charge on the membrane that powers work?

61
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:09,480
That's much easier to understand than something like the ATP synthase as a protein.

62
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:14,640
This is the next slide, I forgive you if you don't notice any difference whatsoever, but

63
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:18,800
in fact everything has just been turned on its head here.

64
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:24,320
The Krebs cycle is now going in the opposite direction, those arrows switched around.

65
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:33,040
It's deliberately looking the same because the reverse Krebs cycle takes CO2 and hydrogen

66
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:37,280
from its environment and cobbles them together to make organic molecules.

67
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:47,280
This happens in various bacteria, it's pretty ancient, and obviously if we get energy out

68
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:52,040
of burning sugars in the Krebs cycle now, then the missing ingredient there is we have

69
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:57,320
to put energy in to make these Krebs cycle intermediates from CO2 and hydrogen.

70
00:05:57,320 --> 00:06:02,280
That energy is coming from exactly what I was just talking about, a charge, an electrical

71
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:08,320
charge on the membrane which is driving the reverse Krebs cycle to make organic molecules

72
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:13,920
from CO2 and hydrogen, simple gases in the environment.

73
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:17,680
That Krebs cycle is the center of all of metabolism really.

74
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:21,040
We make lipids for the membranes, we make amino acids for proteins.

75
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:26,960
We make sugars and nucleotides from ultimately from Krebs cycle intermediates.

76
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:30,560
This is the core and the heart of metabolism across all of life.

77
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:36,160
This is more ancient chemistry than the genes that appear to encode that chemistry.

78
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:41,120
The genes diverge and differ in bacteria and archaea, but the chemistry underlying it remains

79
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:43,520
the same.

80
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:47,960
The third aspect is information.

81
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:54,600
In this case, I will touch on this at the end and there are patterns in the genetic code

82
00:06:54,600 --> 00:07:00,040
which suggests that there are direct interactions between amino acids and the nucleotides that

83
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:03,280
code for them in the genetic code.

84
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:07,480
We don't know exactly what they look like, I'm giving a couple of possible ways of imagining

85
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:14,360
it here, but I will show you that those patterns are real and they're weak and they're statistical

86
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:20,880
but they are real and this can explain the origin of information in biology.

87
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:26,840
In effect, if what we have is a random sequence of RNA, we could say it has no biological

88
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:35,320
information in it, and that templates in one way or another a non-random peptide which

89
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:42,560
has function in the context of, say, growing protocells, and I'll come onto that, then

90
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:46,400
we can select for the sequence which selects for a non-random peptide which has a function

91
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:51,680
in that context, and so information seamlessly emerges, biological information emerges with

92
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:56,880
selection on that sequence in that context, and so there is no problem with the origin

93
00:07:56,880 --> 00:08:01,440
of information in biology if we get the context right.

94
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:05,640
Those are some big claims there and I'll justify them at the end.

95
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:10,440
Another thing to notice about that is I'm talking about electrical charges on membranes

96
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:16,240
driving autotrophic biochemistry starting with CO2 and hydrogen to make all the components

97
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:21,520
of biochemistry which then interact with nucleotides and genetic information comes into existence

98
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:22,520
in this context.

99
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:25,800
In other words, I'm saying everything is happening in the same environment and that's another

100
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:26,800
big ask.

101
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:31,760
I'm not saying that some stuff happens in the atmosphere over there and some other things

102
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:35,800
happened in a deep sea hydrothermal vent and some things happen in Darwin's warm pond.

103
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:40,920
I'm saying it's all happening in one place right now, all at once, and that's a big

104
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:48,240
ask, but it's experimentally very simplifying because it means that we need one set of conditions

105
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:53,760
that are capable of driving all this, and so it becomes experimentally very tractable.

106
00:08:53,760 --> 00:09:00,440
The set of conditions that drive it were proposed not by me at all, by Mike Russell,

107
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:06,120
more than anybody else, but quite a few people have worked on this over 30 years or so now.

108
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:10,480
The conditions, again, keeping this as simple as possible, the conditions that Mike has

109
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:18,680
talked about are hydrogen and CO2 in these alkaline hydrothermal vents which are now found

110
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:23,760
at the bottom of the ocean, but also other environments as well, including on land.

111
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:31,480
At the right hand side here you can see that these are effectively a labyrinth of interconnected

112
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:36,280
pores on a micrometer to millimeter scale.

113
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:42,240
This is modern chemistry in modern oceans, fully oxygenated, and is not reflective of

114
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:46,640
what we would expect to see four billion years ago in the Haiti, and when there was no oxygen

115
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:53,320
there was much more, for example, ferrous iron in the oceans back then.

116
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:57,760
These vents should have had perhaps a similar topology, but the actual chemistry would have

117
00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:03,080
been different and would have included reactive iron-sulfide minerals in there.

118
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:08,280
The hydrothermal fluids are strongly alkaline, pH 11, the early oceans we think would have

119
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:13,440
been mildly acidic, perhaps pH 5 or 6, and so there would have been steep proton gradients

120
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:20,720
across these barriers, and those steep proton gradients in principle can drive work in pretty

121
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:24,720
much the same way that the proton motive force would drive work in cells.

122
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:29,080
It's not exactly an electrical charge, but it's very close to being the same kind of

123
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:30,560
structure.

124
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:32,800
This is effectively it.

125
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:37,760
We have at the left hand side here an inorganic pore at the right hand side a cell.

126
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:43,400
What a cell is doing is pumping protons out across its plasma membrane, so we end up with

127
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:49,480
this high proton concentration and relatively positive charge on the outside and relatively

128
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:55,280
alkaline on the inside, and it's about a three to four pH unit difference, equivalent to

129
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:57,320
a three to four pH unit difference.

130
00:10:57,320 --> 00:11:03,040
In a hydrothermal vent we've got, again, at least arguably a three to four pH unit difference

131
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:10,400
between the inside of a proto, of a pore, let's call it, and ocean waters percolating

132
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:11,640
into these vents.

133
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:16,560
We have a much thicker inorganic barrier surrounding it, and that barrier is likely

134
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:22,440
to include minerals like iron sulfur minerals that couldn't drive some of this work.

135
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:26,440
Is there a way, an imaginable way, that we can go from one of those to the other?

136
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:30,320
This is the hypothesis in a nutshell, and the rest of the talk I'll just give a little

137
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:34,000
bit of data on trying to test this hypothesis.

138
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:41,480
What you're seeing here is a pore in a hydrothermal vent is relatively rich in protons outside.

139
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:43,880
We have this iron sulfide barrier.

140
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:50,000
I'm imagining protons crossing this barrier and driving the reverse Krebs cycle inside

141
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:56,120
this proto, a pore, let's just call it a pore at the moment, so we've got hydrogen

142
00:11:56,120 --> 00:12:02,200
reacting with CO2 driven by an influx of protons, pretty much as happens in cells today.

143
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:07,920
We would expect to see thermodynamically at least fatty acids, so components of lipids

144
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:10,840
and probably some amino acids from that.

145
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:14,200
If we look to the right-hand side, what would we expect those to do?

146
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:18,120
The fatty acids should form some kind of a bilayer membrane, which we can imagine at

147
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:23,440
least might just sit snugly inside this pore.

148
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:31,080
Once we've closed down an enclosed proto cell inside here, we might expect that metabolism

149
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:35,600
will drive further, so not just lipids and amino acids, but perhaps sugars and nucleotides

150
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:36,600
as well.

151
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:37,600
This is imaginable.

152
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:39,720
This is at least a hypothesis.

153
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:45,080
It's also that for protons to be driving Krebs cycle inside a proto cell, we would

154
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:52,480
need to have some kind of an iron-sulfur nanocrystal or iron-sulfur clusters, the same kind of thing

155
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:58,440
that drives this work today, it would need to be sitting in that membrane.

156
00:12:58,440 --> 00:13:02,480
You could label this wishful thinking, but you could also call it a testable hypothesis,

157
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:05,080
and that's how I've been treating it over the last few years.

158
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:09,440
I'm going to break it into these three parts, and I'll skip quite lightly over it, and we

159
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:14,840
can discuss some of the data at more length afterwards.

160
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:19,120
This idea, though, that proton gradients are fundamental, it's something I've been thinking

161
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:26,120
about for a long time, and I tended to think of it in terms of driving molecular machinery

162
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:28,880
rather than as simply phase separations.

163
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:35,400
Now, Peter Mitchell himself, who put this chemo-osmotic hypothesis forward back in the

164
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:41,280
1960s, had been thinking about the origin of life before that in the late 1950s, and

165
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:48,280
there's a lovely quote from a conference in Moscow in 1957 where he said, I cannot consider

166
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:51,000
the organism without its environment.

167
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:55,120
From a formal point of view, the two may be regarded as equivalent phases between which

168
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:59,680
dynamic contact is maintained by the membranes that separate and link them.

169
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:04,480
When he says organism here, he's thinking of a bacterial cell, but instead of trying

170
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:08,600
to define life as something different to the environment, he's more or less conflating them.

171
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:16,600
He's describing them as equivalent phases between which this dynamic contact is maintained.

172
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:22,880
And if we think before there were any cells, before there was anything living, then the

173
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:27,560
idea of a membrane that separates and links two equivalent phases is a very productive

174
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:32,960
way of thinking about the question.

175
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:35,080
So why would that matter?

176
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:37,360
Well, in essence, it's this.

177
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:42,200
The problem with hydrogen is it will not react very readily with CO2.

178
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:47,960
This is just showing vague thermodynamics for two steps rather than a single step, which

179
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:51,280
is why I call it vague, through to formaldehyde.

180
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:56,400
So taking the electrons from hydrogen, pushing them onto CO2 to form formaldehyde.

181
00:14:56,400 --> 00:15:01,960
At pH 7 or any other pH, all I really, for non-chemists, all I really want you to take

182
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,400
away is it's an uphill reaction.

183
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:07,480
It's not going to happen spontaneously.

184
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:13,720
But we don't have hydrogen at pH 7 and we don't have CO2 at pH 7 in an alkaline hydrothermal

185
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:18,080
vent. We've got hydrogen at pH 11 and CO2 at pH 6, say.

186
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:20,640
And that shifts these equations around.

187
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:25,960
And the reason for it is very simple, intuitively, to grasp if hydrogen gives up its electrons

188
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:28,440
in an alkaline environment, what's left behind is protons.

189
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:32,920
Those protons will react immediately with hydroxide ions to form water.

190
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:34,640
It's just a neutralization reaction.

191
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:36,560
It's strongly favored.

192
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:39,680
And so it will happen immediately.

193
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:44,160
So hydrogen is more reducing in an alkaline environment.

194
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:46,880
CO2 needs to pick up electrons.

195
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:49,840
If there are plenty of protons available, they will balance the charges.

196
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:52,800
And then you can pick up more electrons and more protons.

197
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:56,320
So it's easier to reduce CO2 in an acidic environment.

198
00:15:56,320 --> 00:16:01,120
So what we have here, then, is effectively two phases, an alkaline phase and an acid

199
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:06,720
phase, separated by a semi-permeable, semi-conducting barrier.

200
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:11,840
And those phases have hydrogen and CO2 and should be more reactive in those phases.

201
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:14,200
So this is all we effectively need.

202
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:18,240
It's not clear yet whether it's electrons crossing this barrier or protons coming the

203
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:19,400
other way.

204
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:23,080
But this is really just showing visually what I just did.

205
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:29,080
We've got hydrogen on the alkaline side, passing electrons onto an ion-sulfide barrier.

206
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:32,640
The protons react with hydroxide ions to form water.

207
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:37,080
And on the acid side, we've got CO2 picking up protons and electrons from the barrier

208
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:38,080
itself.

209
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:39,960
So this, in principle, should work.

210
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:41,760
It's very easy to set it up.

211
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:42,760
Well, it's not so easy.

212
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:44,400
But in principle, it's easy to set it up.

213
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:48,880
This needs to be done inside a glove box, an anaerobic glove box.

214
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:52,280
Oxygen, even trace amounts of oxygen, really do play around with this.

215
00:16:52,280 --> 00:16:55,320
We need to have it pretty strictly anoxic.

216
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:59,160
This is a microfluidic chip with a barrier that's just spontaneously precipitated by laminar

217
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:05,760
flow with sodium sulfide on one side and, sorry, sodium sulfide on one side, an ion

218
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:07,520
chloride, ferrous chloride.

219
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:11,680
On the other side, they spontaneously precipitate this barrier.

220
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:17,160
And this is just one piece of evidence to show you.

221
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:20,240
Formates is being formed, acetate also.

222
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:22,040
So we'll be getting towards the Krebs cycle.

223
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:26,480
We have seen pyruvate as well, but we've not managed to see it on every occasion yet.

224
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:29,720
And possibly things like methanol as well.

225
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:37,560
So this is stuff that I was hoping for when I last presented to you five or six years ago.

226
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:42,880
But this is now, is being published in PNAS, and this is our own work, which is taking

227
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:44,880
it a little bit further.

228
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:51,120
So just to come back to this figure for a moment, if we are able to reduce CO2 to organics,

229
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:55,280
then we think that they should include amino acids and lipids.

230
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:58,720
The next step then would be to have some kind of protocell.

231
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:04,120
We've taken a leap forward rather than, I mean, we are trying to make these lipids as

232
00:18:04,120 --> 00:18:05,120
well.

233
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:06,120
We've not done so yet.

234
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:10,400
But if we simply take lipids that other people have successfully synthesized under these

235
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:16,880
kind of conditions, we're able to form vesicles under these alkaline hydrothermal conditions.

236
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:23,840
This is another major step, because these vesicles are not supposed to be stable under

237
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:25,600
these pretty harsh conditions.

238
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:29,280
And the literature and our experiments as well show that if you have a very simple vesicle

239
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:33,360
made from decanoic acid, it more or less falls to pieces as soon as you change the pH or

240
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:34,800
the temperature or anything else.

241
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:41,320
But if you have mixtures, slightly messy mixtures of fatty acids and long chain fatty alcohols

242
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:45,800
and so on, especially if you have one-to-one mixtures of these.

243
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:51,240
Then we get, you can see with cryoAM and you can see with thomphocal microscopy there,

244
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:58,640
we are seeing vesicles at pH 12, 70 degrees centigrade, modern ocean salinity in the presence

245
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:00,640
of calcium ions and magnesium ions.

246
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:07,880
So we really are able to form from the kind of fatty acids that have been formed under

247
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:11,480
hydrothermal conditions, you can make vesicles under those conditions.

248
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:15,160
And this was another one I wanted to share with you very briefly.

249
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:20,200
This is UV-Vis spectroscopy and it's showing a classical shoulder, which was the last thing

250
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:26,000
we expected to see there, because that shoulder, when we mix the amino acid cysteine with sodium

251
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:33,640
sulfide and iron chloride, and that's it in water, that shoulder is a 4FE4S cluster,

252
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:38,120
the same thing that we see in ferrodoxin and which is responsible for a lot of CO2 fixation

253
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:40,640
in bacteria today.

254
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:43,800
And we've looked at different concentrations of everything, including the cysteine, we've

255
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:49,720
used MOSpower spectroscopy to characterize the clusters, and we've used cyclic voltammetry

256
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:55,200
to show their redox potential, and it's exactly the same as ferrodoxin.

257
00:19:55,200 --> 00:20:00,160
This is the midpoint reduction potential and it's about minus 450 millivolts, which is

258
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:07,560
right in the region for reducing CO2, though we would not yet use them to reduce CO2.

259
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:13,280
So it seems to be possible to make this machinery under surprisingly simple sets of conditions.

260
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:19,360
So I'm going to say a little bit about metabolism, and again I'm going to skip likely over some

261
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:24,040
data and then I'll finish with the code itself.

262
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:30,440
So this is the core of metabolism, I've mentioned the Krebs cycle, this is not really the cycle

263
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:36,600
so much as some of the steps, so acetyl-CoA or some equivalent to it, prebiotic equivalent,

264
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:41,600
through to pyruvate, we're now into the Krebs cycle, oxaloacetate, alpha ketoglutarate and

265
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:42,600
so on.

266
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:46,680
What we really want you to notice here is this is CO2 at the top left, and in a kind

267
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:51,400
of brownie red color we've got hydrogen, hydrogen, hydrogen, lots of hydrogen in there, in green

268
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:56,800
we've got CO2, again there's CO2 everywhere that you look pretty much, this is the chemistry

269
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:59,880
of hydrogen and CO2 and there's not much more to it.

270
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:03,720
When we get amino acids we're beginning to see ammonia in there as well.

271
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:10,280
The blue arrows here are basically experiments that have been done successfully under prebiotic

272
00:21:10,280 --> 00:21:15,120
conditions by us and by other people, there are several labs around the world doing this

273
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:21,400
kind of chemistry and the red boxes are showing the precursors for nucleotide synthesis following

274
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:25,600
the biological pathways as the starting point.

275
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:28,720
So much of this chemistry has now been done.

276
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:35,800
One of the things that has been missing from there is cysteine synthesis and we've recently,

277
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:39,040
I mean this is about as much as we've got at the moment, it's not very much but this

278
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:51,040
is a peak for cysteine on NMR, sorry that was on HPLC I beg your pardon, and it looks

279
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:57,420
like we've managed to do a one pot synthesis of cysteine starting from glycine through

280
00:21:57,420 --> 00:22:05,720
cyrene to cysteine and we're also able to produce spartate and alanine under those kind

281
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:06,720
of conditions.

282
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:10,480
This is basically using life as a guide and a lot of these we've used pyrodoxamine which

283
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:14,600
is a simple cofactor used by life and it's that which is catalyzing these reactions.

284
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:19,160
So another problem then is can we make pyrodoxamine under these conditions?

285
00:22:19,160 --> 00:22:25,400
So there's always more questions that we've not answered yet but we can make the cysteine.

286
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:26,800
That's not published yet.

287
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:31,280
This is also uracil synthesis and again I'll skip very lightly over it but this is following

288
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:36,200
the biological pathway starting with ammonia, carbonate and a spartate which I just mentioned

289
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:44,920
we've synthesized and this goes through to uracil which is one of the bases in RNA and

290
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:51,000
again this is a one pot synthesis starting over here and we've made both oratate and

291
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:56,120
uracil that way and when we just do these last few steps going from dihydro oratate

292
00:22:56,120 --> 00:23:02,280
to uracil and we try to optimize them so we looked at a panel of different metal ions,

293
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:07,320
we looked at different pHs, we looked at different temperatures, different salinities

294
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:11,200
and things like that and worked out what the optimal conditions were.

295
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:18,040
It turned out those optimal conditions are about 90 degrees centigrade, pH 9, high pressure,

296
00:23:18,040 --> 00:23:24,320
100 bars pressure, modern ocean salinity so that was very gratifying and this at the right

297
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:28,760
hand side here is showing those optimal conditions, uracil synthesis when we when we matched up

298
00:23:28,760 --> 00:23:34,120
the optimal conditions apart from that's not high pressure that's just atmospheric pressure

299
00:23:34,120 --> 00:23:38,280
so that was an eight-fold increase in yield when we optimized those conditions.

300
00:23:39,320 --> 00:23:44,600
Whoops that just hopped forward this is the last thing I'll say about metabolism but I mentioned

301
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:52,280
ATP a couple of times it's now produced by this amazing rotating nanomotor the ATP synthase

302
00:23:52,840 --> 00:23:57,160
that's obviously a product of genes and natural selection and must have come later but then the

303
00:23:57,160 --> 00:24:02,120
question is so why did ATP become the universal energy currency and this is

304
00:24:03,160 --> 00:24:09,160
this is some beautiful work from a former PhD student of mine Silvana Pinna who showed that

305
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:18,680
mildly acidic pH in this case and at 30 or 50 degrees centigrade in water starting with acetyl

306
00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:24,920
phosphate and ferric iron and ADP the acetyl phosphate will phosphorylate ADP to ATP at around

307
00:24:24,920 --> 00:24:32,680
15 to 20 yield just in in water and she tried a whole range of other phosphorylating agents and

308
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:39,080
none of them really worked carbonyl phosphate worked a little bit, cyclic TMP worked a little bit

309
00:24:39,080 --> 00:24:44,920
but basically acetyl phosphate does that job beautifully and interestingly still does that

310
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:51,800
job today in bacteria and archaea but the the other beautiful thing about this was it works with ATP

311
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:56,840
but it doesn't work with any of the other nuclear bases in other words we can make ATP but we can't

312
00:24:56,840 --> 00:25:05,560
make CTP or UTP or ITP or GTP and so on um so why is ATP the universal energy currency the answer

313
00:25:05,560 --> 00:25:12,440
seems to be because you can make it fairly easily with minimum um minimum catalytic requirements

314
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:19,240
and simply acetyl phosphate which is a two carbon phosphorylating agent in water at reasonable

315
00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:27,640
temperatures and pressures and so on so that's by no means does that say that's why ATP is

316
00:25:27,640 --> 00:25:31,960
the universal energy currency but it's certainly almost uncanny that that we can make that and

317
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:38,280
nothing else under those conditions so for the last five minutes or so I'd like to touch on

318
00:25:38,280 --> 00:25:44,600
information and this is some of the most beautiful work that I have been involved in in the last few

319
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:51,480
years and I should say that these ideas came from Stuart Harrison who did his PhD in my lab and is

320
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:57,640
now doing a postdoc job with me and so this is actually I'm used to thinking and and I'm not

321
00:25:57,640 --> 00:26:02,680
used to my PhD students and postdoc coming up with the best ideas and this is what's happened

322
00:26:02,680 --> 00:26:09,000
on this occasion so it's very pleasing actually in in many respects this is metabolism again

323
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:15,160
as we've seen it starting with CO2 coming through into pyruvate oxaloacetate and so on

324
00:26:16,040 --> 00:26:22,760
and in the the colors lozenges are the amino acids and they're color coded according to

325
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:33,000
the first base of the codon that encodes them in DNA or in RNA and so glycine alanine aspartate

326
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:38,840
and glutamate are all encoded by a gene at the first position as well where it makes sense

327
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:44,440
yeah get that get that awareness and build that picture yeah I was going to go to the foundry

328
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:48,600
ones as well though I don't really like it's quite like I'm not going to go to the deep dive I'm

329
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:52,280
probably going to go to the overview because I feel like that'd be more like able for me I think the

330
00:26:52,280 --> 00:26:57,880
deep dive will be a bit too technical for me it's probably going to be more at the practitioner

331
00:26:58,360 --> 00:27:02,440
I think you'll get a good sense at the high level one from what they've been what they've talked

332
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:06,120
about so that they did good to get immersed in that yeah

333
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:12,680
no they're not gone

334
00:27:14,920 --> 00:27:15,720
shall I continue

335
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:28,280
okay I'll I'll continue so can you hear me okay

336
00:27:29,800 --> 00:27:36,840
yes I think we can yes good so so in gray then it's G at the first position of the codon

337
00:27:36,840 --> 00:27:41,800
and then in yellow it's an A at the first position of the codon and then in blue it's a C

338
00:27:41,800 --> 00:27:48,680
side to dean and in green it's a U at the first position of the codon so there's plainly patterning

339
00:27:48,680 --> 00:27:55,400
there and it seems to link to the distance from co2 fixation and at the bottom right there that's

340
00:27:55,400 --> 00:28:02,600
just showing exactly that distance the number of steps from co2 fixation what exactly this tells us

341
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:09,720
is not entirely clear but it seems to it seems to suggest that the the organization of the code or

342
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:16,600
the first letter of the codon is linked in some way to the pattern of metabolism we do have ideas

343
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:20,120
about why that might be and we can talk about it afterwards but I'll just leave it that there's

344
00:28:20,120 --> 00:28:27,080
clearly a pattern there and that patterns an interesting one if we then so what we're seeing

345
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:36,680
here is the is is the hydrophobicity of of the amino acid in relation to the second letter of

346
00:28:36,680 --> 00:28:42,200
the anti codon and we're arranging them in boxes with G at the first position of the codon then A

347
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:47,960
then C then then U as we had before and all I really want you to take away from this is there's a

348
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:55,320
clear relationship that A is the most hydrophobic amino acid and V is the most hydrophobic base

349
00:28:55,960 --> 00:29:01,880
so this is there is a relationship between the hydrophobicity of the base and the hydrophobicity

350
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:07,880
of the amino acid that it codes for and at the other end of this one it's spartate and that is

351
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:14,040
encoded by a U which is the most hydrophilic of the basis so there's a clear patterning there

352
00:29:14,040 --> 00:29:18,680
especially if there's a purine at the first position a gRNA at the first position we see

353
00:29:18,680 --> 00:29:24,120
quite a strong relationship with where there's a pyrimidine at the first position and that's less

354
00:29:24,120 --> 00:29:29,560
of a strong relationship but it's not gone away completely so again all I really want you to take

355
00:29:29,560 --> 00:29:35,880
away from it is there are patterns in the code that depend on the bio on the hydrophobicity

356
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:41,800
of the amino acids and the bases which suggest direct stereochemical interactions between them

357
00:29:42,520 --> 00:29:48,600
this kind of thing has been known for a long time but the patterning is stronger when we set it out

358
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:54,760
around an autotrophic protometabolism and this is the third position and again only a couple of

359
00:29:54,760 --> 00:29:59,560
things I really want you to notice here but this is an inverted codon table which is to say

360
00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:06,600
these are the amino acids that are coded in the outermost ring this is the first position

361
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:11,400
of the codon and the second position of the codon and then the third position of the codon

362
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:17,960
in the in the most part there so just to give one example here we have glutamate and a spartate

363
00:30:18,920 --> 00:30:23,080
and they both have a g at the first position they both have an a at the second position

364
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:31,000
but glutamate has a purine at the third position of the codon whereas a spartate has a pyrimidine

365
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:36,760
at the third position of the codon and what we see if we if we now switch this to the

366
00:30:36,760 --> 00:30:44,680
anticodon not the codon what we find is that if there's effectively a big bulky base a purine

367
00:30:44,680 --> 00:30:50,280
rather than the pyrimidine at the third position then we'll always see the smallest amino acid

368
00:30:50,280 --> 00:30:54,360
so this is the size of the amino acids that could be coded for there and we always see

369
00:30:55,080 --> 00:30:59,800
that the when there's a larger base there's a smaller amino acid so again it just suggests

370
00:30:59,800 --> 00:31:06,840
that there's direct interactions between the chemistry of the amino acids its hydrophobicity

371
00:31:06,840 --> 00:31:14,440
and so on and its size so all of this is very suggestive but there's no doubt various ways

372
00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:18,680
in which it could be interpreted and so this is the last slide then and this is work which is

373
00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:24,680
should be published in the next week or two I hope and this is doing a mixture of molecular

374
00:31:24,680 --> 00:31:30,760
dynamic simulations so all in silico and some NMR work which which is ongoing but these are the

375
00:31:30,760 --> 00:31:37,240
first four that way and what we're seeing here this is basically the proportion of time spent

376
00:31:37,240 --> 00:31:44,440
the amino acid spends in the vicinity of specific bases these are mononutriotides so AMP, CMP,

377
00:31:44,440 --> 00:31:51,160
GMP or UMP and you can this is proline in this particular case and what you're seeing is that

378
00:31:51,160 --> 00:31:58,200
it spends much more time within two angstroms of GMP than anything else there is a direct

379
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:04,440
predicted interaction between proline and GMP which happens to be the base that codes for it

380
00:32:04,440 --> 00:32:09,240
at the second position of the anticodal we see something a little bit similar underneath for

381
00:32:09,240 --> 00:32:13,640
a spartate but this is much muddier in that case it tends to spend quite a lot of time

382
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:22,760
with almost everything but in that case it's also I think it's GMP is slightly better.

383
00:32:22,760 --> 00:32:28,760
What we're seeing in effect is we can predict 50% of the of the middle bases of the anticodons that

384
00:32:28,760 --> 00:32:34,120
way we're much better at predicting this is all the amino acids across the bottom here and it's

385
00:32:34,120 --> 00:32:38,520
on a scale going from hydrophobic at the left hand end to hydrophilic at the right hand end

386
00:32:38,520 --> 00:32:42,680
and we can get the hydrophilic interactions pretty well the hydrophobic interactions this

387
00:32:42,680 --> 00:32:48,920
method is much less good at predicting correctly the hydrophobic interactions but still we are

388
00:32:48,920 --> 00:32:54,360
we're better than 99% of random allocations if we simply assume that there were random

389
00:32:54,360 --> 00:33:02,040
interactions our predictions are better than 99% and we also when we do NMR work and we're looking

390
00:33:02,040 --> 00:33:07,560
at the binding constants for these it's again it's easier to work with hydrophilic amino acids

391
00:33:07,560 --> 00:33:12,760
because you can get higher concentrations in water it's it's more fiddly trying to do it with

392
00:33:12,760 --> 00:33:18,680
hydrophobic bases and hydrophobic amino acids in water but we're seeing that essentially the same

393
00:33:18,680 --> 00:33:26,680
patterns so we are I would take this as broad confirmation that there really are weak but

394
00:33:26,680 --> 00:33:37,240
statistically systematic interactions between amino acids and the bases that code for them in

395
00:33:37,240 --> 00:33:41,480
the genetic code and so that picture that I showed you at the beginning suggesting that there can be

396
00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:46,360
some kind of templating or non-random templating that if you've got a random stretch of RNA you will

397
00:33:46,360 --> 00:33:54,200
get a non-random peptide which is interacting with it that seems to be borne out in other words as I

398
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:59,400
said at the beginning there should be no problem with information at the origin of the code that's

399
00:33:59,400 --> 00:34:03,720
all I'm going to say I just want to have a final call out to the people who've been doing this work

400
00:34:04,280 --> 00:34:08,760
this is over of some years now I just like this picture because they're holding up the

401
00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:14,920
reverse Krebs cycle there this was a birthday present they did a few years ago and I like

402
00:34:14,920 --> 00:34:19,640
it too much too so a few of these people have left the group now but I still keep this image

403
00:34:20,200 --> 00:34:23,880
but they are the people who've really been doing all this experimental work that I've

404
00:34:23,880 --> 00:34:29,000
talked about and that's it so I will stop sharing and I look forward to your questions.

405
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:41,480
Well thank you Nick that was that that was quite a tour de force so thank you and I'm not sure we

406
00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:50,760
have many questions yet in the chat box so we had a bit of an interruption there in the sound I'm

407
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:56,040
not sure quite what happened there yeah sorry I apologize for that Alan I had a cup of tea delivered

408
00:34:56,040 --> 00:35:05,240
oh sorry okay anyway okay it's audience's chance to to fire away with some questions from from

409
00:35:06,600 --> 00:35:15,160
for Nick if you'd like to unmute yourself and put your video on and wave your hands we can

410
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:25,240
some questions don't be shy. Can I maybe start with one Nick you kind of touched on the thermodynamics

411
00:35:25,240 --> 00:35:30,280
so how much of how much of this is a thermodynamic process alongside the chemistry?

412
00:35:31,480 --> 00:35:37,000
I think it's predominantly thermodynamic in the sense that what we're dealing with is an environment

413
00:35:38,680 --> 00:35:45,720
which is continuously out of equilibrium because we have continuous flow of hydrothermal fluids

414
00:35:45,720 --> 00:35:52,040
which are rich in hydrogen in the modern vents that it's up to about 15 millimolar equivalent

415
00:35:52,120 --> 00:35:57,800
hydrogen and CO2 and in the early oceans we don't know what it was exactly but but you know

416
00:35:57,800 --> 00:36:04,840
potentially more than a bar of CO2 back then so the modern systems are somewhat carbon starved

417
00:36:04,840 --> 00:36:10,120
because they're alkaline and it precipitates out carbonate but but in in the older systems there

418
00:36:10,120 --> 00:36:17,240
would have been an overwhelming amount of CO2 there and so thermodynamically it is it's it's

419
00:36:17,240 --> 00:36:24,360
exegonic to be producing pretty much all of all of the biomolecules um it's it's simply an exothermic

420
00:36:24,360 --> 00:36:34,360
reaction. So then it's down to the catalyst. Yeah so and we have a few hands up with a couple of

421
00:36:34,360 --> 00:36:39,640
hands up there's one there from from Victor Victor would you like to unmute yourself and ask your

422
00:36:39,640 --> 00:36:47,720
question okay i'm up can you hear me yeah okay yep i had a question which might not be as knowledgeable

423
00:36:47,720 --> 00:36:55,560
as some of the other people's questions are in in this session um so you've you've looked at the

424
00:36:55,560 --> 00:37:01,080
life that we have and the building blocks that build up that life and kind of working backwards to

425
00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:07,960
some simple conditions where those building blocks might have might have had their origin

426
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:14,600
um is there another form of life that could have developed rather than the one that we've got or

427
00:37:14,600 --> 00:37:20,520
maybe it did develop at certain stages and then it it it died out for some reason it wasn't as

428
00:37:20,520 --> 00:37:27,400
successful um in terms of the changing conditions on the planet from when life first formed it may

429
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:32,120
not have had any longevity associated with it is there's some other thing that we could have

430
00:37:32,760 --> 00:37:38,520
and that would have ended up with something completely different potentially yes uh and it

431
00:37:38,520 --> 00:37:45,080
is uh it's a very good question and it's one which keeps me awake at night i think but uh but it's um

432
00:37:46,840 --> 00:37:54,280
there's to my mind there's something a little bit uncanny about all of this metabolic biochemistry

433
00:37:54,280 --> 00:37:59,720
just happening in the absence of genes and information and and some of it i can understand

434
00:38:00,360 --> 00:38:05,320
but the further we get from co2 fixation the more unbelievable it seems to be that's uh

435
00:38:05,320 --> 00:38:09,640
that impure in synthesis or well permadein synthesis as we're working on purine synthesis

436
00:38:09,640 --> 00:38:17,560
and it's well that's a bit hard work um but um we tend that you think there's all these side

437
00:38:17,560 --> 00:38:23,720
reactions that could happen and should happen uh and to a larger extent don't happen what we tend to see

438
00:38:23,720 --> 00:38:31,560
is is small amounts of the intermediates along these known metabolic pathways forming spontaneously

439
00:38:31,560 --> 00:38:40,840
and interchanging between themselves at low low levels um and why why those ones why not other

440
00:38:40,840 --> 00:38:45,320
ones this is the the essence of your question and i think a lot will depend on the starting point

441
00:38:45,320 --> 00:38:49,400
which is to say if we're starting with hydrogen and co2 at a particular temperature

442
00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:54,440
we're likely to get a certain metabolic network if you like and if we change the starting point

443
00:38:54,440 --> 00:38:58,200
to something else or we change the temperature or we change any of those parameters then easily you

444
00:38:58,200 --> 00:39:07,720
could get a different network um so so why this network um it still seems uncanny but if you think

445
00:39:07,720 --> 00:39:11,880
about what the genes would be doing then as soon as we introduce information into this system there

446
00:39:11,880 --> 00:39:18,520
is a serious problem here which has been largely overlooked in my view uh about um how

447
00:39:19,960 --> 00:39:28,040
an RNA world invents metabolism which is the standard view but but but the the RNA world of

448
00:39:28,040 --> 00:39:32,440
people have really got as far as trying to replicate RNA and haven't really worried themselves very

449
00:39:32,440 --> 00:39:37,800
much yet about how how you know as soon as you got something which is capable of self replicating

450
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:43,320
then you've got a system which is capable of evolution and and and it's easy lazy to put it

451
00:39:43,320 --> 00:39:49,240
aside there and say okay so it'll evolve there is no conceptual problem but there is a conceptual

452
00:39:49,240 --> 00:39:55,240
problem to my mind because if you invent one enzyme that catalyzes one step in a metabolic pathway

453
00:39:55,240 --> 00:40:00,040
and there's 10 steps in that pathway then it's absolutely no use to you you really need all 10

454
00:40:00,760 --> 00:40:07,320
enzymes in that pathway and and so it's beginning to look less probable but and what what use is one

455
00:40:07,320 --> 00:40:13,880
pathway you actually need multiple pathways to have anything that's any use to you so a more

456
00:40:14,680 --> 00:40:20,520
rigorous way of thinking about what's actually what entity is being selected and what are the

457
00:40:20,520 --> 00:40:26,840
reasons it's being selected uh you're left facing quite a large part of proto metabolism needs to

458
00:40:26,840 --> 00:40:33,640
be doing it to produce the required amino acids nucleotide sugars whatever else is is required

459
00:40:33,640 --> 00:40:40,520
to to have a system which is capable of replicating itself um and and again the the problem is still

460
00:40:41,240 --> 00:40:47,080
there's no point in having any one of those pathways by itself um or at least there's no

461
00:40:47,080 --> 00:40:53,800
obvious point that I can see um so there's a there's a serious combinatorial problem there

462
00:40:54,840 --> 00:41:00,760
that's never been seriously addressed and I suspect it's borderline impossibly difficult

463
00:41:02,280 --> 00:41:07,800
but if what actually you see instead is a kind of a spontaneous proto metabolism that happens to

464
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:13,960
have a particular network structure to it and what the first genes do is increase flux through

465
00:41:13,960 --> 00:41:21,560
that pathway for example by steepening the driving force so increasing the fixation of CO2 to make

466
00:41:21,560 --> 00:41:25,480
the first intermediates in that pathway then you get increased flux through the entire network so

467
00:41:25,480 --> 00:41:30,760
that's not intrinsically very difficult what that says then if you take a step back is that what the

468
00:41:30,760 --> 00:41:35,880
first genes are doing is amplifying the network and so the fact that we get the same network and

469
00:41:35,880 --> 00:41:40,200
the entire thing is amplified is in fact a direct prediction of assuming that network comes first

470
00:41:41,880 --> 00:41:47,880
in which case we should be able to turn that on its head and say okay well if if we can look at the

471
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:51,960
conditions that give rise to that entire network then we should be able to predict the you know

472
00:41:51,960 --> 00:41:55,880
if we can get the entire network under this set of conditions but not that set then we might be able

473
00:41:55,880 --> 00:42:04,200
to say the conditions under which life arose well that's very good thank you okay thank you for that

474
00:42:04,200 --> 00:42:10,920
Nick we have another question from Chelsea Chen could you unmute yourself please Chelsea and

475
00:42:10,920 --> 00:42:18,680
if you want to put your video on we can see you too perhaps. Hello can I just ask about why ATP

476
00:42:19,800 --> 00:42:27,720
can be spontaneously synthesized in water while other nucleosides can't? Yes you can ask

477
00:42:28,440 --> 00:42:35,400
I'd like to say I could answer we did we did some molecular dynamic simulations on that

478
00:42:37,160 --> 00:42:42,920
and it seems to be in part to do with the with the charge density on ferric iron,

479
00:42:42,920 --> 00:42:47,880
ferric iron was necessary and other other other other metal ions did not work in the same way,

480
00:42:47,880 --> 00:42:55,560
it seems to be partly to do with the actual orientation of the phosphate group of acetyl

481
00:42:55,560 --> 00:43:01,880
phosphates in relation to the ferric iron and the ADP tail I mean we came up with a potential

482
00:43:01,880 --> 00:43:05,960
explanation for the orientation some of it seems to be to do with the way that the ring

483
00:43:05,960 --> 00:43:11,400
nitrogen's interact with ferric iron and I don't understand that very well but they interact very

484
00:43:11,400 --> 00:43:20,040
differently with say guanine compared to adenosine so why I'm not quite sure but the prediction is

485
00:43:20,040 --> 00:43:26,200
that you know molecular dynamic prediction is that you do not have the orientation of the acetyl

486
00:43:26,200 --> 00:43:31,080
phosphate in the right place and and it tends to abstract the catalyst it abstracts the ferric

487
00:43:31,080 --> 00:43:36,280
iron which interacts with the nitrogen on the ring instead so we have some answers but I'm not

488
00:43:36,280 --> 00:43:40,360
persuaded that they're the right answers or that the molecular dynamic simulations are

489
00:43:42,840 --> 00:43:49,080
real I don't know enough of what's going on under the bonnet with them with the atomic forces that

490
00:43:49,160 --> 00:43:57,320
they're predicting I am not a chemist I'm a biochemist and and you know I try to get my hands

491
00:43:57,320 --> 00:44:02,040
dirty with all of this stuff but it's I think we need a proper chemist to look at some of that

492
00:44:03,720 --> 00:44:10,360
okay thank you thanks we have a question from Jim Cunningham on this chat box there

493
00:44:11,640 --> 00:44:17,480
Nick can you see that uh oh he's asking when when when will the book come out about all this

494
00:44:17,480 --> 00:44:25,080
it takes more than 45 minutes to digest at all well I I am trying to put together a proposal

495
00:44:25,080 --> 00:44:29,480
now to write a book on the origin of life specifically covering more or less what I've

496
00:44:29,480 --> 00:44:36,600
said today but it will be some years before it's written I mean we're not I'm neither chemist

497
00:44:36,600 --> 00:44:44,200
nor biochemist so I do have a book that was out last year that touches on some of the actual

498
00:44:44,200 --> 00:44:48,920
chemistry of the Krebs cycle and some of the ideas I've just talked about now so that's out

499
00:44:48,920 --> 00:44:56,360
already but the genetic code stuff is quite new um and I'm I'm quite excited by it but

500
00:44:57,800 --> 00:45:03,560
the path going from a pattern to a predicted set of steps that we can then test that uh

501
00:45:03,560 --> 00:45:07,800
I I want to delay writing the book until we've done some of that and I have something to say about

502
00:45:08,520 --> 00:45:20,040
hmm these these steps you're predicting they seem to depend uh on specifically specific

503
00:45:20,040 --> 00:45:25,880
earth conditions but perhaps earth-like conditions um what they

504
00:45:28,360 --> 00:45:35,320
yes they they I mean what we would get from this metabolic network is a specific set of amino acids

505
00:45:36,280 --> 00:45:40,600
and we would tend to get those amino acids and we would tend to we would predict an order in

506
00:45:40,600 --> 00:45:48,360
which we get them as well um the extent to which we would expect to see exactly the four bases

507
00:45:48,360 --> 00:45:54,040
that we see in RNA compared to a bunch of other possible ones that are and there's a lot of modified

508
00:45:54,040 --> 00:46:01,160
bases around um I'm less sure about that so one thing we want to do is is model metabolism

509
00:46:02,120 --> 00:46:07,240
where we're varying the thermodynamic parameters and kinetic parameters on each of the but

510
00:46:07,240 --> 00:46:11,480
basically it's more the thermodynamics than the kinetics what's the likelihood of each reaction

511
00:46:11,480 --> 00:46:19,400
happening and given that we have no clear idea no clear data under the sets of conditions that

512
00:46:19,400 --> 00:46:24,440
we might be thinking about if we if we model it we can vary across orders of magnitude and obviously

513
00:46:24,440 --> 00:46:29,160
if you make an oxidation reaction more likely then a reduction step is less likely and so on so we

514
00:46:29,160 --> 00:46:35,960
can we can we can vary parameters um in relation to each other and try to see how much of of

515
00:46:35,960 --> 00:46:43,800
metabolism we actually recover and do we recover then the the core of it in which case we would

516
00:46:43,800 --> 00:46:49,000
expect to see exactly the same interaction somewhere else in which case if we discovered life on Mars

517
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:54,120
and it has exactly the same genetic code then it doesn't prove that it was a contamination

518
00:46:54,840 --> 00:47:01,960
um or it may be that it's much looser than that and that um that if you know if effectively

519
00:47:02,600 --> 00:47:07,640
we would expect to see some but not all or or or it's very contingent on which bases you produce

520
00:47:07,640 --> 00:47:13,240
and which ones get incorporated into RNA or DNA uh then that would come up with a different set

521
00:47:13,240 --> 00:47:18,360
of predictions there's a lot that we don't know or I don't know um but but there's a lot you know

522
00:47:18,440 --> 00:47:24,920
there's a huge amount that can be done here so yeah could could I could I ask a quick supplementary

523
00:47:24,920 --> 00:47:31,400
on that please nick um you've been talking about the the bases you find in in RNA and you mentioned

524
00:47:31,400 --> 00:47:39,720
uracil yes as I recall in in in DNA we've got cytosine, uranine, alanine and thymine have we not

525
00:47:39,720 --> 00:47:46,920
do we know do we know why thymine came along as opposed to uracil in DNA um I mean there are ideas

526
00:47:46,920 --> 00:47:56,760
out there um and it's partly to do with stability um and and and decreasing the risk of mutations

527
00:47:56,760 --> 00:48:03,800
because if I'm probably going to get this wrong I can't quite remember but um if if if there is a

528
00:48:04,360 --> 00:48:10,120
I think an oxidation of uracil then uh you end up with producing something very similar to one

529
00:48:10,120 --> 00:48:17,640
of the other bases uh I need to double check that uh in other words there there's more scope for

530
00:48:18,440 --> 00:48:31,960
um for I suppose confusion replacing the wrong base so so that'd be part of it in part um RNA

531
00:48:31,960 --> 00:48:37,480
does not tend to form structures as stable as DNA and I'm not sure that's to do with the bases

532
00:48:37,480 --> 00:48:47,560
so much as to do with the deoxy versus ribose um but I I don't we've not really started thinking

533
00:48:47,560 --> 00:48:52,280
very much about DNA yet it's plain that as soon as you've got DNA you've got a much larger much

534
00:48:52,280 --> 00:48:58,360
more stable structure which is going to lower the error error error rate um but uh that's another

535
00:48:58,360 --> 00:49:03,800
another reason I want to delay writing a book on this until I until I figure it out how does DNA

536
00:49:03,960 --> 00:49:09,400
how does that fit into this picture right well please don't delay it too long

537
00:49:10,360 --> 00:49:16,920
like to read it um now then Chelsea Chen has had a supplementary right if she's still around

538
00:49:16,920 --> 00:49:24,760
she's welcome to read otherwise I'll read it out are you there Chelsea yes do you want to go ahead

539
00:49:24,760 --> 00:49:32,040
with your supplementary about purely RNA compounds uh sorry this is not no longer Chelsea Chen but

540
00:49:32,040 --> 00:49:42,440
but it's the same question do one yes do we know do we know if there is uh if there are any RNA

541
00:49:42,440 --> 00:49:48,280
purely RNA compounds that are capable of catalyzing reactions such as uh condensing uh condensing

542
00:49:48,280 --> 00:49:56,040
amino acids or or nucleotides um well I mean there there's been a lot of interest over decades in

543
00:49:56,040 --> 00:50:02,920
what's called the RNA world and there are plenty of ribosomes which are basically catalysts a bit

544
00:50:02,920 --> 00:50:09,720
like an enzyme enzymes are made of proteins and ribosomes are made of RNA and RNA will tend to

545
00:50:09,720 --> 00:50:16,680
form into interesting shapes and knots and has quite a wide range of catalytic functions much

546
00:50:16,680 --> 00:50:24,360
less than proteins but but but certainly um you know capable of catalyzing quite complex chemistry

547
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:28,680
and so this has been the basis for what's being called the RNA world hypothesis

548
00:50:30,440 --> 00:50:36,120
and that really goes back to to people like Leslie Orgel in the 1960s in the late 1960s

549
00:50:36,840 --> 00:50:41,000
and it the ideas are very simple and very appealing which is more or less that

550
00:50:41,560 --> 00:50:47,720
because of complementary base pairing it's it's you know conceptually very easy for an RNA to make

551
00:50:47,720 --> 00:50:53,640
a copy of itself whereas for a peptide to make a copy of itself is much more problematic and complex

552
00:50:53,720 --> 00:50:59,880
and and difficult um so if you were to say which comes first then RNA has to come before

553
00:50:59,880 --> 00:51:06,840
peptides in that sense at least as a hereditary mechanism um but what that has tended to lead

554
00:51:06,840 --> 00:51:12,680
to is a rather purest view of an RNA world where as I said RNA invents everything else it invents

555
00:51:12,680 --> 00:51:18,280
all of metabolism and that view has been I would say receding over the last five to ten years or so

556
00:51:18,280 --> 00:51:22,600
with a kind of recognition that chemistry is dirtier than that and that there will be other

557
00:51:22,600 --> 00:51:26,360
things in there there will be lipids in there there will be amino acids maybe peptides in there

558
00:51:26,360 --> 00:51:32,600
and we've we've got a kind of a dirty RNA world so there's no question that RNA is central to all

559
00:51:32,600 --> 00:51:39,880
of this um and that's that this was almost only the first code and it's interesting that the ribosome

560
00:51:40,440 --> 00:51:46,920
which is the big protein building factories in cells they're basically ribosomes um the the

561
00:51:47,640 --> 00:51:52,520
the RNA content is very high and as far as I'm aware it's the ribosomes that are doing

562
00:51:52,600 --> 00:51:59,880
most of the catalysis of peptide bond formation um so so it's interesting that they have an

563
00:51:59,880 --> 00:52:03,960
absolutely central critical job and this is one thing that we're trying to think our way through

564
00:52:03,960 --> 00:52:08,920
to and do some experiments on as well but this is a highly populated area you may say because it's

565
00:52:09,480 --> 00:52:13,880
it's so central to the question people have been working on it a lot for a long time um

566
00:52:13,880 --> 00:52:22,440
um ironically RNA does not copy itself in cells and this this kind of holy grail of having a

567
00:52:22,440 --> 00:52:28,040
ribosome that will copy itself which was the the essence of the RNA world actually the it's an

568
00:52:28,040 --> 00:52:33,960
enzyme that does that job it's the RNA polymerase it's a magnesium dependent protein um and so

569
00:52:33,960 --> 00:52:43,240
there's this this interesting um RNA effectively copies proteins and proteins copy RNA so we're

570
00:52:43,240 --> 00:52:49,720
back in this strange chicken and egg situation that uh that that is not easily unscrambled um

571
00:52:49,720 --> 00:52:53,720
I've forgotten exactly what your question was but essentially could how much work does RNA do

572
00:52:53,720 --> 00:52:58,760
and the answer is it's very central to a lot of this um but it it's not the only thing that's going

573
00:52:58,760 --> 00:53:07,480
on uh and I think peptides early are are pretty necessary. Nick that's been a very stimulating

574
00:53:08,440 --> 00:53:16,280
afternoon thank you so much um before we go um you you you've clearly got a collection of your

575
00:53:16,280 --> 00:53:21,720
fans here in the audience would you like just to say give a quick a quick commercial for the

576
00:53:21,720 --> 00:53:26,920
other book that you have written very recently the one on trans you call transformers. Oh that's

577
00:53:26,920 --> 00:53:35,400
very kind of you yes why not I'm not sure that I'm not sure I would be intellectually fair of me to

578
00:53:35,880 --> 00:53:40,840
over plug it because it's it's a book on the Krebs cycle uh which is not to everybody's taste

579
00:53:40,840 --> 00:53:47,960
right on it attempts to link the chemistry that I touched on on the origin of life which is which

580
00:53:47,960 --> 00:53:54,680
is making Krebs cycle intermediates from CO2 and hydrogen but I have I have another lab group at

581
00:53:54,680 --> 00:54:00,040
UCL which is working on mitochondrial functions so still and energetics and so on right and it

582
00:54:00,040 --> 00:54:03,800
turned out both groups were measuring Krebs cycle intermediates for most of their lives so

583
00:54:04,520 --> 00:54:10,280
I had to put two and two together um and and you know the the Krebs cycle goes into reverse in

584
00:54:10,280 --> 00:54:16,120
cancer for example and it's it's certainly um and then what's it doing well it's driving cells

585
00:54:16,120 --> 00:54:20,600
copying themselves it's instead of being about energy it's about making the building blocks

586
00:54:20,600 --> 00:54:25,800
required to make a new cancer cell so all of the lipids all of the DNA and and so on that's required

587
00:54:26,600 --> 00:54:33,000
so metabolism the central cycle in metabolism is central right across the whole spectrum of life

588
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:39,400
from the origin of life up to um to aging and cancer and I there's an epilogue where I have a

589
00:54:39,400 --> 00:54:46,200
go at linking it to consciousness as well which is beyond most people's tolerance for speculation

590
00:54:46,200 --> 00:54:50,520
in science but that's where I finished with the book so that's my plug for the book but if you

591
00:54:50,520 --> 00:54:56,360
don't like metabolic biochemistry then then then you may prefer just to watch a short talk online

592
00:54:56,360 --> 00:55:02,360
or something right okay well thank you so much right well we've had a wonderful afternoon

593
00:55:03,080 --> 00:55:09,000
which I've hugely enjoyed and I'm sure everybody else has so without a do I apart from thanking you

594
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:16,840
again I'd like to pass over to our chairman uh professor David Southwood if I don't have his

595
00:55:16,840 --> 00:55:24,920
screen up in front of me but uh David over to you if I may thank you Ellen and Nick thank you very

596
00:55:24,920 --> 00:55:35,080
much for an invigorating afternoon um origin of life I think how can how can we not be interested

597
00:55:35,080 --> 00:55:44,440
in it and how can we not feel some of the emotions that you clearly feel the curiosity of it the um

598
00:55:45,320 --> 00:55:51,720
the fact that things have come out of it and yet there we are it's one of the big mysteries that

599
00:55:51,720 --> 00:55:58,920
we live with as human beings in my view so I really think you've taken us on a wonderful voyage

600
00:55:58,920 --> 00:56:07,480
and your enthusiasm is absolutely magnificent I think we'll need to communicate I much admire

601
00:56:08,120 --> 00:56:15,880
and um so I think if I can ask people generally to unmute or to use the symbol for clapping

602
00:56:15,880 --> 00:56:26,040
to give you a sign that we really did appreciate your time this time this afternoon so thank you very much
