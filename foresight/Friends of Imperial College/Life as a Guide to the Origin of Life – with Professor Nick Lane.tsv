0	9840	This is a question I've been working on for a long time now, and the last few years have
9840	16600	become, I would say, really quite exciting, and the central ideas have become more crystallized
16600	21840	in my mind than they had been before, and it's very much about using life as a guide
21840	28280	to the origin of life, which immediately sounds like it's tautologous in some way, that
28280	36000	it's, I could call it turtles all the way down, it seems as if there's an infinite regress
36000	43360	involved in that, but it begs the question, how can we possibly know what the answer is?
43360	47360	And if you take it almost literally and say, imagine that we had a time machine and we
47360	53920	go back to some time around the origin of life, what would we actually look for?
53920	58480	And the answer is, well, we would have no idea if we found some kind of green slime
58480	63720	or something, we wouldn't really know, was this the origin of life, was this just some
63720	70280	slime, was it on the path towards life, was it a failed experiment?
70280	75520	Actually what we really need to know, what we really need to have is a framework, a rigorous
75520	81240	intellectual framework which shows how a sterile non-living planet can give rise to
81240	85360	a living planet and we need to know what all the predicted steps would be along that
85360	92840	path and then how to test for them to see whether or not they actually have any substance
92840	94800	in them or not.
94800	99080	And so we'll never know how life started on Earth because it's a historical question
99080	103480	and we can't go back and if we did go back, as I say, we still wouldn't actually see what
103480	104560	the answer was.
104560	110520	What we need is this rigorous framework and that's where I think life as a guide comes
110520	118040	in because there is a spectrum and that spectrum starts somewhere almost unknowable, but let's
118040	122720	assume for the sake of argument that it was on the early Earth and that it was in Earth-like
122720	130240	conditions rather than in outer space somewhere or, you know, panspermia may have happened,
130240	133520	however, it tells us nothing about the conditions under which life can start.
133520	138200	So it's an assumption that life started on Earth and we know the other end of the continuum,
138200	142320	the other end of this continuum is life itself, cells like bacterial cells that have a genetic
142320	148360	code that have DNA and RNA and proteins and membranes and everything else we know about
148360	149600	cells.
149600	153120	So we know one end of the continuum and all we need to do is figure out the other end
153120	156200	and how to join it up.
156200	162520	Now what I'll argue very briefly then is that life is an extremely good guide to its own
162520	165040	origin and I'm going to break it into three sections.
165040	169360	One is energy, the second is metabolism, and the third is genetic information.
169360	172240	So I will try and address all three today.
172240	179000	Before I get going, I'm going to just orientate you with a few slides about what I mean by
179000	180440	energy and so on.
180440	185960	So this is, you could imagine it as a bacterial cell or you could see it as the mitochondria
185960	190840	in our own cells, but effectively what we're seeing here inside this lozenge-shaped thing,
190840	198120	if that is a cell, I'm showing it respiring and respiration is effectively taking something
198120	202840	like glucose, breaking it down through the Krebs cycle, and the Krebs cycle, you don't
202840	204160	need to know what it is.
204160	211720	All it's really doing is stripping CO2 and hydrogen out of food, out of any organic molecules.
211720	223400	Now the CO2 is a waste product which we simply breathe out, and the hydrogen is not in the
223400	228800	form of hydrogen, it's in the form of NADH in our own cells, but it's basically two
228800	230400	hydrogen atoms.
230400	237320	They are being split for physicists, we're going to get somewhere in the vicinity of
237320	242200	fundamental particles, so it's basically electrons and protons.
242200	249600	The electrons are passed to oxygen in the membrane, so it has effectively a current
249600	254920	of electrons within an insulating membrane through redox centers in that membrane, and
254920	259280	the current of electrons powers the extrusion of protons across the membrane, which is
259280	265840	what I'm showing, let me just get a pointer up on here.
265840	269720	So we have a charge on the membrane, the protons are positively charged of course,
269720	275280	and so we have a relatively positive charge on the outside of the membrane, relatively
275280	278520	negative inside, and that's known as the proton motive force.
278520	284560	It drives for example ATP synthesis, but it basically drives all work in cells, and that's
284560	285560	all we need to know.
285560	289920	We can put ATP aside for the time being and just think of we have an electrically charged
289920	295560	membrane that drives powers work in cells, and that I think is the fundamental thing
295560	296680	that we need to explain.
296680	304120	Why is it that cells work by having an electrical charge on the membrane that powers work?
304120	309480	That's much easier to understand than something like the ATP synthase as a protein.
309480	314640	This is the next slide, I forgive you if you don't notice any difference whatsoever, but
314640	318800	in fact everything has just been turned on its head here.
318800	324320	The Krebs cycle is now going in the opposite direction, those arrows switched around.
324320	333040	It's deliberately looking the same because the reverse Krebs cycle takes CO2 and hydrogen
333040	337280	from its environment and cobbles them together to make organic molecules.
337280	347280	This happens in various bacteria, it's pretty ancient, and obviously if we get energy out
347280	352040	of burning sugars in the Krebs cycle now, then the missing ingredient there is we have
352040	357320	to put energy in to make these Krebs cycle intermediates from CO2 and hydrogen.
357320	362280	That energy is coming from exactly what I was just talking about, a charge, an electrical
362280	368320	charge on the membrane which is driving the reverse Krebs cycle to make organic molecules
368320	373920	from CO2 and hydrogen, simple gases in the environment.
373920	377680	That Krebs cycle is the center of all of metabolism really.
377680	381040	We make lipids for the membranes, we make amino acids for proteins.
381040	386960	We make sugars and nucleotides from ultimately from Krebs cycle intermediates.
386960	390560	This is the core and the heart of metabolism across all of life.
390560	396160	This is more ancient chemistry than the genes that appear to encode that chemistry.
396160	401120	The genes diverge and differ in bacteria and archaea, but the chemistry underlying it remains
401120	403520	the same.
403520	407960	The third aspect is information.
407960	414600	In this case, I will touch on this at the end and there are patterns in the genetic code
414600	420040	which suggests that there are direct interactions between amino acids and the nucleotides that
420040	423280	code for them in the genetic code.
423280	427480	We don't know exactly what they look like, I'm giving a couple of possible ways of imagining
427480	434360	it here, but I will show you that those patterns are real and they're weak and they're statistical
434360	440880	but they are real and this can explain the origin of information in biology.
440880	446840	In effect, if what we have is a random sequence of RNA, we could say it has no biological
446840	455320	information in it, and that templates in one way or another a non-random peptide which
455320	462560	has function in the context of, say, growing protocells, and I'll come onto that, then
462560	466400	we can select for the sequence which selects for a non-random peptide which has a function
466400	471680	in that context, and so information seamlessly emerges, biological information emerges with
471680	476880	selection on that sequence in that context, and so there is no problem with the origin
476880	481440	of information in biology if we get the context right.
481440	485640	Those are some big claims there and I'll justify them at the end.
485640	490440	Another thing to notice about that is I'm talking about electrical charges on membranes
490440	496240	driving autotrophic biochemistry starting with CO2 and hydrogen to make all the components
496240	501520	of biochemistry which then interact with nucleotides and genetic information comes into existence
501520	502520	in this context.
502520	505800	In other words, I'm saying everything is happening in the same environment and that's another
505800	506800	big ask.
507160	511760	I'm not saying that some stuff happens in the atmosphere over there and some other things
511760	515800	happened in a deep sea hydrothermal vent and some things happen in Darwin's warm pond.
515800	520920	I'm saying it's all happening in one place right now, all at once, and that's a big
520920	528240	ask, but it's experimentally very simplifying because it means that we need one set of conditions
528240	533760	that are capable of driving all this, and so it becomes experimentally very tractable.
533760	540440	The set of conditions that drive it were proposed not by me at all, by Mike Russell,
540440	546120	more than anybody else, but quite a few people have worked on this over 30 years or so now.
546120	550480	The conditions, again, keeping this as simple as possible, the conditions that Mike has
550480	558680	talked about are hydrogen and CO2 in these alkaline hydrothermal vents which are now found
558680	563760	at the bottom of the ocean, but also other environments as well, including on land.
563760	571480	At the right hand side here you can see that these are effectively a labyrinth of interconnected
571480	576280	pores on a micrometer to millimeter scale.
576280	582240	This is modern chemistry in modern oceans, fully oxygenated, and is not reflective of
582240	586640	what we would expect to see four billion years ago in the Haiti, and when there was no oxygen
586640	593320	there was much more, for example, ferrous iron in the oceans back then.
593320	597760	These vents should have had perhaps a similar topology, but the actual chemistry would have
597760	603080	been different and would have included reactive iron-sulfide minerals in there.
603080	608280	The hydrothermal fluids are strongly alkaline, pH 11, the early oceans we think would have
608280	613440	been mildly acidic, perhaps pH 5 or 6, and so there would have been steep proton gradients
613440	620720	across these barriers, and those steep proton gradients in principle can drive work in pretty
620720	624720	much the same way that the proton motive force would drive work in cells.
624720	629080	It's not exactly an electrical charge, but it's very close to being the same kind of
629080	630560	structure.
630560	632800	This is effectively it.
632800	637760	We have at the left hand side here an inorganic pore at the right hand side a cell.
637760	643400	What a cell is doing is pumping protons out across its plasma membrane, so we end up with
643400	649480	this high proton concentration and relatively positive charge on the outside and relatively
649480	655280	alkaline on the inside, and it's about a three to four pH unit difference, equivalent to
655280	657320	a three to four pH unit difference.
657320	663040	In a hydrothermal vent we've got, again, at least arguably a three to four pH unit difference
663040	670400	between the inside of a proto, of a pore, let's call it, and ocean waters percolating
670400	671640	into these vents.
671640	676560	We have a much thicker inorganic barrier surrounding it, and that barrier is likely
676560	682440	to include minerals like iron sulfur minerals that couldn't drive some of this work.
682440	686440	Is there a way, an imaginable way, that we can go from one of those to the other?
686440	690320	This is the hypothesis in a nutshell, and the rest of the talk I'll just give a little
690320	694000	bit of data on trying to test this hypothesis.
694000	701480	What you're seeing here is a pore in a hydrothermal vent is relatively rich in protons outside.
701480	703880	We have this iron sulfide barrier.
703880	710000	I'm imagining protons crossing this barrier and driving the reverse Krebs cycle inside
710000	716120	this proto, a pore, let's just call it a pore at the moment, so we've got hydrogen
716120	722200	reacting with CO2 driven by an influx of protons, pretty much as happens in cells today.
722200	727920	We would expect to see thermodynamically at least fatty acids, so components of lipids
727920	730840	and probably some amino acids from that.
730840	734200	If we look to the right-hand side, what would we expect those to do?
734200	738120	The fatty acids should form some kind of a bilayer membrane, which we can imagine at
738120	743440	least might just sit snugly inside this pore.
743440	751080	Once we've closed down an enclosed proto cell inside here, we might expect that metabolism
751080	755600	will drive further, so not just lipids and amino acids, but perhaps sugars and nucleotides
755600	756600	as well.
756600	757600	This is imaginable.
757600	759720	This is at least a hypothesis.
759720	765080	It's also that for protons to be driving Krebs cycle inside a proto cell, we would
765080	772480	need to have some kind of an iron-sulfur nanocrystal or iron-sulfur clusters, the same kind of thing
772480	778440	that drives this work today, it would need to be sitting in that membrane.
778440	782480	You could label this wishful thinking, but you could also call it a testable hypothesis,
782480	785080	and that's how I've been treating it over the last few years.
785080	789440	I'm going to break it into these three parts, and I'll skip quite lightly over it, and we
789440	794840	can discuss some of the data at more length afterwards.
794840	799120	This idea, though, that proton gradients are fundamental, it's something I've been thinking
799120	806120	about for a long time, and I tended to think of it in terms of driving molecular machinery
806120	808880	rather than as simply phase separations.
808880	815400	Now, Peter Mitchell himself, who put this chemo-osmotic hypothesis forward back in the
815480	821280	1960s, had been thinking about the origin of life before that in the late 1950s, and
821280	828280	there's a lovely quote from a conference in Moscow in 1957 where he said, I cannot consider
828280	831000	the organism without its environment.
831000	835120	From a formal point of view, the two may be regarded as equivalent phases between which
835120	839680	dynamic contact is maintained by the membranes that separate and link them.
839680	844480	When he says organism here, he's thinking of a bacterial cell, but instead of trying
844520	848600	to define life as something different to the environment, he's more or less conflating them.
848600	856600	He's describing them as equivalent phases between which this dynamic contact is maintained.
856720	862880	And if we think before there were any cells, before there was anything living, then the
862880	867560	idea of a membrane that separates and links two equivalent phases is a very productive
867560	872960	way of thinking about the question.
872960	875080	So why would that matter?
875080	877360	Well, in essence, it's this.
877360	882200	The problem with hydrogen is it will not react very readily with CO2.
882200	887960	This is just showing vague thermodynamics for two steps rather than a single step, which
887960	891280	is why I call it vague, through to formaldehyde.
891280	896400	So taking the electrons from hydrogen, pushing them onto CO2 to form formaldehyde.
896400	901960	At pH 7 or any other pH, all I really, for non-chemists, all I really want you to take
902000	904400	away is it's an uphill reaction.
904400	907480	It's not going to happen spontaneously.
907480	913720	But we don't have hydrogen at pH 7 and we don't have CO2 at pH 7 in an alkaline hydrothermal
913720	918080	vent. We've got hydrogen at pH 11 and CO2 at pH 6, say.
918080	920640	And that shifts these equations around.
920640	925960	And the reason for it is very simple, intuitively, to grasp if hydrogen gives up its electrons
925960	928440	in an alkaline environment, what's left behind is protons.
928440	932920	Those protons will react immediately with hydroxide ions to form water.
932920	934640	It's just a neutralization reaction.
934640	936560	It's strongly favored.
936560	939680	And so it will happen immediately.
939680	944160	So hydrogen is more reducing in an alkaline environment.
944160	946880	CO2 needs to pick up electrons.
946880	949840	If there are plenty of protons available, they will balance the charges.
949840	952800	And then you can pick up more electrons and more protons.
952800	956320	So it's easier to reduce CO2 in an acidic environment.
956320	961120	So what we have here, then, is effectively two phases, an alkaline phase and an acid
961120	966720	phase, separated by a semi-permeable, semi-conducting barrier.
966720	971840	And those phases have hydrogen and CO2 and should be more reactive in those phases.
971840	974200	So this is all we effectively need.
974200	978240	It's not clear yet whether it's electrons crossing this barrier or protons coming the
978240	979400	other way.
979400	983080	But this is really just showing visually what I just did.
983080	989080	We've got hydrogen on the alkaline side, passing electrons onto an ion-sulfide barrier.
989080	992640	The protons react with hydroxide ions to form water.
992640	997080	And on the acid side, we've got CO2 picking up protons and electrons from the barrier
997080	998080	itself.
998080	999960	So this, in principle, should work.
999960	1001760	It's very easy to set it up.
1001760	1002760	Well, it's not so easy.
1002760	1004400	But in principle, it's easy to set it up.
1004400	1008880	This needs to be done inside a glove box, an anaerobic glove box.
1008880	1012280	Oxygen, even trace amounts of oxygen, really do play around with this.
1012280	1015320	We need to have it pretty strictly anoxic.
1015320	1019160	This is a microfluidic chip with a barrier that's just spontaneously precipitated by laminar
1019160	1025760	flow with sodium sulfide on one side and, sorry, sodium sulfide on one side, an ion
1025760	1027520	chloride, ferrous chloride.
1027520	1031680	On the other side, they spontaneously precipitate this barrier.
1031680	1037160	And this is just one piece of evidence to show you.
1037160	1040240	Formates is being formed, acetate also.
1040240	1042040	So we'll be getting towards the Krebs cycle.
1042040	1046480	We have seen pyruvate as well, but we've not managed to see it on every occasion yet.
1046480	1049720	And possibly things like methanol as well.
1049720	1057560	So this is stuff that I was hoping for when I last presented to you five or six years ago.
1057560	1062880	But this is now, is being published in PNAS, and this is our own work, which is taking
1062880	1064880	it a little bit further.
1064880	1071120	So just to come back to this figure for a moment, if we are able to reduce CO2 to organics,
1071120	1075280	then we think that they should include amino acids and lipids.
1075280	1078720	The next step then would be to have some kind of protocell.
1078720	1084120	We've taken a leap forward rather than, I mean, we are trying to make these lipids as
1084120	1085120	well.
1085120	1086120	We've not done so yet.
1086120	1090400	But if we simply take lipids that other people have successfully synthesized under these
1090400	1096880	kind of conditions, we're able to form vesicles under these alkaline hydrothermal conditions.
1096880	1103840	This is another major step, because these vesicles are not supposed to be stable under
1103840	1105600	these pretty harsh conditions.
1105600	1109280	And the literature and our experiments as well show that if you have a very simple vesicle
1109280	1113360	made from decanoic acid, it more or less falls to pieces as soon as you change the pH or
1113360	1114800	the temperature or anything else.
1114800	1121320	But if you have mixtures, slightly messy mixtures of fatty acids and long chain fatty alcohols
1121320	1125800	and so on, especially if you have one-to-one mixtures of these.
1125800	1131240	Then we get, you can see with cryoAM and you can see with thomphocal microscopy there,
1131240	1138640	we are seeing vesicles at pH 12, 70 degrees centigrade, modern ocean salinity in the presence
1138640	1140640	of calcium ions and magnesium ions.
1140640	1147880	So we really are able to form from the kind of fatty acids that have been formed under
1147880	1151480	hydrothermal conditions, you can make vesicles under those conditions.
1151480	1155160	And this was another one I wanted to share with you very briefly.
1155160	1160200	This is UV-Vis spectroscopy and it's showing a classical shoulder, which was the last thing
1160200	1166000	we expected to see there, because that shoulder, when we mix the amino acid cysteine with sodium
1166000	1173640	sulfide and iron chloride, and that's it in water, that shoulder is a 4FE4S cluster,
1173640	1178120	the same thing that we see in ferrodoxin and which is responsible for a lot of CO2 fixation
1178120	1180640	in bacteria today.
1180640	1183800	And we've looked at different concentrations of everything, including the cysteine, we've
1183800	1189720	used MOSpower spectroscopy to characterize the clusters, and we've used cyclic voltammetry
1189720	1195200	to show their redox potential, and it's exactly the same as ferrodoxin.
1195200	1200160	This is the midpoint reduction potential and it's about minus 450 millivolts, which is
1200160	1207560	right in the region for reducing CO2, though we would not yet use them to reduce CO2.
1207560	1213280	So it seems to be possible to make this machinery under surprisingly simple sets of conditions.
1214280	1219360	So I'm going to say a little bit about metabolism, and again I'm going to skip likely over some
1219360	1224040	data and then I'll finish with the code itself.
1224040	1230440	So this is the core of metabolism, I've mentioned the Krebs cycle, this is not really the cycle
1230440	1236600	so much as some of the steps, so acetyl-CoA or some equivalent to it, prebiotic equivalent,
1236600	1241600	through to pyruvate, we're now into the Krebs cycle, oxaloacetate, alpha ketoglutarate and
1241600	1242600	so on.
1242600	1246680	What we really want you to notice here is this is CO2 at the top left, and in a kind
1246680	1251400	of brownie red color we've got hydrogen, hydrogen, hydrogen, lots of hydrogen in there, in green
1251400	1256800	we've got CO2, again there's CO2 everywhere that you look pretty much, this is the chemistry
1256800	1259880	of hydrogen and CO2 and there's not much more to it.
1259880	1263720	When we get amino acids we're beginning to see ammonia in there as well.
1263720	1270280	The blue arrows here are basically experiments that have been done successfully under prebiotic
1270280	1275120	conditions by us and by other people, there are several labs around the world doing this
1275120	1281400	kind of chemistry and the red boxes are showing the precursors for nucleotide synthesis following
1281400	1285600	the biological pathways as the starting point.
1285600	1288720	So much of this chemistry has now been done.
1288720	1295800	One of the things that has been missing from there is cysteine synthesis and we've recently,
1295800	1299040	I mean this is about as much as we've got at the moment, it's not very much but this
1299040	1311040	is a peak for cysteine on NMR, sorry that was on HPLC I beg your pardon, and it looks
1311040	1317420	like we've managed to do a one pot synthesis of cysteine starting from glycine through
1317420	1325720	cyrene to cysteine and we're also able to produce spartate and alanine under those kind
1325720	1326720	of conditions.
1327000	1330480	This is basically using life as a guide and a lot of these we've used pyrodoxamine which
1330480	1334600	is a simple cofactor used by life and it's that which is catalyzing these reactions.
1334600	1339160	So another problem then is can we make pyrodoxamine under these conditions?
1339160	1345400	So there's always more questions that we've not answered yet but we can make the cysteine.
1345400	1346800	That's not published yet.
1346800	1351280	This is also uracil synthesis and again I'll skip very lightly over it but this is following
1351280	1356200	the biological pathway starting with ammonia, carbonate and a spartate which I just mentioned
1357080	1364920	we've synthesized and this goes through to uracil which is one of the bases in RNA and
1364920	1371000	again this is a one pot synthesis starting over here and we've made both oratate and
1371000	1376120	uracil that way and when we just do these last few steps going from dihydro oratate
1376120	1382280	to uracil and we try to optimize them so we looked at a panel of different metal ions,
1382280	1387320	we looked at different pHs, we looked at different temperatures, different salinities
1387320	1391200	and things like that and worked out what the optimal conditions were.
1391200	1398040	It turned out those optimal conditions are about 90 degrees centigrade, pH 9, high pressure,
1398040	1404320	100 bars pressure, modern ocean salinity so that was very gratifying and this at the right
1404320	1408760	hand side here is showing those optimal conditions, uracil synthesis when we when we matched up
1408760	1414120	the optimal conditions apart from that's not high pressure that's just atmospheric pressure
1414120	1418280	so that was an eight-fold increase in yield when we optimized those conditions.
1419320	1424600	Whoops that just hopped forward this is the last thing I'll say about metabolism but I mentioned
1424600	1432280	ATP a couple of times it's now produced by this amazing rotating nanomotor the ATP synthase
1432840	1437160	that's obviously a product of genes and natural selection and must have come later but then the
1437160	1442120	question is so why did ATP become the universal energy currency and this is
1443160	1449160	this is some beautiful work from a former PhD student of mine Silvana Pinna who showed that
1450440	1458680	mildly acidic pH in this case and at 30 or 50 degrees centigrade in water starting with acetyl
1458680	1464920	phosphate and ferric iron and ADP the acetyl phosphate will phosphorylate ADP to ATP at around
1464920	1472680	15 to 20 yield just in in water and she tried a whole range of other phosphorylating agents and
1472680	1479080	none of them really worked carbonyl phosphate worked a little bit, cyclic TMP worked a little bit
1479080	1484920	but basically acetyl phosphate does that job beautifully and interestingly still does that
1484920	1491800	job today in bacteria and archaea but the the other beautiful thing about this was it works with ATP
1491800	1496840	but it doesn't work with any of the other nuclear bases in other words we can make ATP but we can't
1496840	1505560	make CTP or UTP or ITP or GTP and so on um so why is ATP the universal energy currency the answer
1505560	1512440	seems to be because you can make it fairly easily with minimum um minimum catalytic requirements
1512440	1519240	and simply acetyl phosphate which is a two carbon phosphorylating agent in water at reasonable
1519240	1527640	temperatures and pressures and so on so that's by no means does that say that's why ATP is
1527640	1531960	the universal energy currency but it's certainly almost uncanny that that we can make that and
1531960	1538280	nothing else under those conditions so for the last five minutes or so I'd like to touch on
1538280	1544600	information and this is some of the most beautiful work that I have been involved in in the last few
1544600	1551480	years and I should say that these ideas came from Stuart Harrison who did his PhD in my lab and is
1551480	1557640	now doing a postdoc job with me and so this is actually I'm used to thinking and and I'm not
1557640	1562680	used to my PhD students and postdoc coming up with the best ideas and this is what's happened
1562680	1569000	on this occasion so it's very pleasing actually in in many respects this is metabolism again
1569000	1575160	as we've seen it starting with CO2 coming through into pyruvate oxaloacetate and so on
1576040	1582760	and in the the colors lozenges are the amino acids and they're color coded according to
1584200	1593000	the first base of the codon that encodes them in DNA or in RNA and so glycine alanine aspartate
1593000	1598840	and glutamate are all encoded by a gene at the first position as well where it makes sense
1599800	1604440	yeah get that get that awareness and build that picture yeah I was going to go to the foundry
1604440	1608600	ones as well though I don't really like it's quite like I'm not going to go to the deep dive I'm
1608600	1612280	probably going to go to the overview because I feel like that'd be more like able for me I think the
1612280	1617880	deep dive will be a bit too technical for me it's probably going to be more at the practitioner
1618360	1622440	I think you'll get a good sense at the high level one from what they've been what they've talked
1622440	1626120	about so that they did good to get immersed in that yeah
1631800	1632680	no they're not gone
1634920	1635720	shall I continue
1635720	1648280	okay I'll I'll continue so can you hear me okay
1649800	1656840	yes I think we can yes good so so in gray then it's G at the first position of the codon
1656840	1661800	and then in yellow it's an A at the first position of the codon and then in blue it's a C
1661800	1668680	side to dean and in green it's a U at the first position of the codon so there's plainly patterning
1668680	1675400	there and it seems to link to the distance from co2 fixation and at the bottom right there that's
1675400	1682600	just showing exactly that distance the number of steps from co2 fixation what exactly this tells us
1682600	1689720	is not entirely clear but it seems to it seems to suggest that the the organization of the code or
1689720	1696600	the first letter of the codon is linked in some way to the pattern of metabolism we do have ideas
1696600	1700120	about why that might be and we can talk about it afterwards but I'll just leave it that there's
1700120	1707080	clearly a pattern there and that patterns an interesting one if we then so what we're seeing
1707080	1716680	here is the is is the hydrophobicity of of the amino acid in relation to the second letter of
1716680	1722200	the anti codon and we're arranging them in boxes with G at the first position of the codon then A
1722200	1727960	then C then then U as we had before and all I really want you to take away from this is there's a
1727960	1735320	clear relationship that A is the most hydrophobic amino acid and V is the most hydrophobic base
1735960	1741880	so this is there is a relationship between the hydrophobicity of the base and the hydrophobicity
1741880	1747880	of the amino acid that it codes for and at the other end of this one it's spartate and that is
1747880	1754040	encoded by a U which is the most hydrophilic of the basis so there's a clear patterning there
1754040	1758680	especially if there's a purine at the first position a gRNA at the first position we see
1758680	1764120	quite a strong relationship with where there's a pyrimidine at the first position and that's less
1764120	1769560	of a strong relationship but it's not gone away completely so again all I really want you to take
1769560	1775880	away from it is there are patterns in the code that depend on the bio on the hydrophobicity
1775880	1781800	of the amino acids and the bases which suggest direct stereochemical interactions between them
1782520	1788600	this kind of thing has been known for a long time but the patterning is stronger when we set it out
1788600	1794760	around an autotrophic protometabolism and this is the third position and again only a couple of
1794760	1799560	things I really want you to notice here but this is an inverted codon table which is to say
1800440	1806600	these are the amino acids that are coded in the outermost ring this is the first position
1806600	1811400	of the codon and the second position of the codon and then the third position of the codon
1811400	1817960	in the in the most part there so just to give one example here we have glutamate and a spartate
1818920	1823080	and they both have a g at the first position they both have an a at the second position
1823640	1831000	but glutamate has a purine at the third position of the codon whereas a spartate has a pyrimidine
1831000	1836760	at the third position of the codon and what we see if we if we now switch this to the
1836760	1844680	anticodon not the codon what we find is that if there's effectively a big bulky base a purine
1844680	1850280	rather than the pyrimidine at the third position then we'll always see the smallest amino acid
1850280	1854360	so this is the size of the amino acids that could be coded for there and we always see
1855080	1859800	that the when there's a larger base there's a smaller amino acid so again it just suggests
1859800	1866840	that there's direct interactions between the chemistry of the amino acids its hydrophobicity
1866840	1874440	and so on and its size so all of this is very suggestive but there's no doubt various ways
1874440	1878680	in which it could be interpreted and so this is the last slide then and this is work which is
1879240	1884680	should be published in the next week or two I hope and this is doing a mixture of molecular
1884680	1890760	dynamic simulations so all in silico and some NMR work which which is ongoing but these are the
1890760	1897240	first four that way and what we're seeing here this is basically the proportion of time spent
1897240	1904440	the amino acid spends in the vicinity of specific bases these are mononutriotides so AMP, CMP,
1904440	1911160	GMP or UMP and you can this is proline in this particular case and what you're seeing is that
1911160	1918200	it spends much more time within two angstroms of GMP than anything else there is a direct
1919000	1924440	predicted interaction between proline and GMP which happens to be the base that codes for it
1924440	1929240	at the second position of the anticodal we see something a little bit similar underneath for
1929240	1933640	a spartate but this is much muddier in that case it tends to spend quite a lot of time
1933640	1942760	with almost everything but in that case it's also I think it's GMP is slightly better.
1942760	1948760	What we're seeing in effect is we can predict 50% of the of the middle bases of the anticodons that
1948760	1954120	way we're much better at predicting this is all the amino acids across the bottom here and it's
1954120	1958520	on a scale going from hydrophobic at the left hand end to hydrophilic at the right hand end
1958520	1962680	and we can get the hydrophilic interactions pretty well the hydrophobic interactions this
1962680	1968920	method is much less good at predicting correctly the hydrophobic interactions but still we are
1968920	1974360	we're better than 99% of random allocations if we simply assume that there were random
1974360	1982040	interactions our predictions are better than 99% and we also when we do NMR work and we're looking
1982040	1987560	at the binding constants for these it's again it's easier to work with hydrophilic amino acids
1987560	1992760	because you can get higher concentrations in water it's it's more fiddly trying to do it with
1992760	1998680	hydrophobic bases and hydrophobic amino acids in water but we're seeing that essentially the same
1998680	2006680	patterns so we are I would take this as broad confirmation that there really are weak but
2006680	2017240	statistically systematic interactions between amino acids and the bases that code for them in
2017240	2021480	the genetic code and so that picture that I showed you at the beginning suggesting that there can be
2021480	2026360	some kind of templating or non-random templating that if you've got a random stretch of RNA you will
2026360	2034200	get a non-random peptide which is interacting with it that seems to be borne out in other words as I
2034200	2039400	said at the beginning there should be no problem with information at the origin of the code that's
2039400	2043720	all I'm going to say I just want to have a final call out to the people who've been doing this work
2044280	2048760	this is over of some years now I just like this picture because they're holding up the
2048760	2054920	reverse Krebs cycle there this was a birthday present they did a few years ago and I like
2054920	2059640	it too much too so a few of these people have left the group now but I still keep this image
2060200	2063880	but they are the people who've really been doing all this experimental work that I've
2063880	2069000	talked about and that's it so I will stop sharing and I look forward to your questions.
2069800	2081480	Well thank you Nick that was that that was quite a tour de force so thank you and I'm not sure we
2081480	2090760	have many questions yet in the chat box so we had a bit of an interruption there in the sound I'm
2090760	2096040	not sure quite what happened there yeah sorry I apologize for that Alan I had a cup of tea delivered
2096040	2105240	oh sorry okay anyway okay it's audience's chance to to fire away with some questions from from
2106600	2115160	for Nick if you'd like to unmute yourself and put your video on and wave your hands we can
2116440	2125240	some questions don't be shy. Can I maybe start with one Nick you kind of touched on the thermodynamics
2125240	2130280	so how much of how much of this is a thermodynamic process alongside the chemistry?
2131480	2137000	I think it's predominantly thermodynamic in the sense that what we're dealing with is an environment
2138680	2145720	which is continuously out of equilibrium because we have continuous flow of hydrothermal fluids
2145720	2152040	which are rich in hydrogen in the modern vents that it's up to about 15 millimolar equivalent
2152120	2157800	hydrogen and CO2 and in the early oceans we don't know what it was exactly but but you know
2157800	2164840	potentially more than a bar of CO2 back then so the modern systems are somewhat carbon starved
2164840	2170120	because they're alkaline and it precipitates out carbonate but but in in the older systems there
2170120	2177240	would have been an overwhelming amount of CO2 there and so thermodynamically it is it's it's
2177240	2184360	exegonic to be producing pretty much all of all of the biomolecules um it's it's simply an exothermic
2184360	2194360	reaction. So then it's down to the catalyst. Yeah so and we have a few hands up with a couple of
2194360	2199640	hands up there's one there from from Victor Victor would you like to unmute yourself and ask your
2199640	2207720	question okay i'm up can you hear me yeah okay yep i had a question which might not be as knowledgeable
2207720	2215560	as some of the other people's questions are in in this session um so you've you've looked at the
2215560	2221080	life that we have and the building blocks that build up that life and kind of working backwards to
2222280	2227960	some simple conditions where those building blocks might have might have had their origin
2228760	2234600	um is there another form of life that could have developed rather than the one that we've got or
2234600	2240520	maybe it did develop at certain stages and then it it it died out for some reason it wasn't as
2240520	2247400	successful um in terms of the changing conditions on the planet from when life first formed it may
2247400	2252120	not have had any longevity associated with it is there's some other thing that we could have
2252760	2258520	and that would have ended up with something completely different potentially yes uh and it
2258520	2265080	is uh it's a very good question and it's one which keeps me awake at night i think but uh but it's um
2266840	2274280	there's to my mind there's something a little bit uncanny about all of this metabolic biochemistry
2274280	2279720	just happening in the absence of genes and information and and some of it i can understand
2280360	2285320	but the further we get from co2 fixation the more unbelievable it seems to be that's uh
2285320	2289640	that impure in synthesis or well permadein synthesis as we're working on purine synthesis
2289640	2297560	and it's well that's a bit hard work um but um we tend that you think there's all these side
2297560	2303720	reactions that could happen and should happen uh and to a larger extent don't happen what we tend to see
2303720	2311560	is is small amounts of the intermediates along these known metabolic pathways forming spontaneously
2311560	2320840	and interchanging between themselves at low low levels um and why why those ones why not other
2320840	2325320	ones this is the the essence of your question and i think a lot will depend on the starting point
2325320	2329400	which is to say if we're starting with hydrogen and co2 at a particular temperature
2329400	2334440	we're likely to get a certain metabolic network if you like and if we change the starting point
2334440	2338200	to something else or we change the temperature or we change any of those parameters then easily you
2338200	2347720	could get a different network um so so why this network um it still seems uncanny but if you think
2347720	2351880	about what the genes would be doing then as soon as we introduce information into this system there
2351880	2358520	is a serious problem here which has been largely overlooked in my view uh about um how
2359960	2368040	an RNA world invents metabolism which is the standard view but but but the the RNA world of
2368040	2372440	people have really got as far as trying to replicate RNA and haven't really worried themselves very
2372440	2377800	much yet about how how you know as soon as you got something which is capable of self replicating
2377800	2383320	then you've got a system which is capable of evolution and and and it's easy lazy to put it
2383320	2389240	aside there and say okay so it'll evolve there is no conceptual problem but there is a conceptual
2389240	2395240	problem to my mind because if you invent one enzyme that catalyzes one step in a metabolic pathway
2395240	2400040	and there's 10 steps in that pathway then it's absolutely no use to you you really need all 10
2400760	2407320	enzymes in that pathway and and so it's beginning to look less probable but and what what use is one
2407320	2413880	pathway you actually need multiple pathways to have anything that's any use to you so a more
2414680	2420520	rigorous way of thinking about what's actually what entity is being selected and what are the
2420520	2426840	reasons it's being selected uh you're left facing quite a large part of proto metabolism needs to
2426840	2433640	be doing it to produce the required amino acids nucleotide sugars whatever else is is required
2433640	2440520	to to have a system which is capable of replicating itself um and and again the the problem is still
2441240	2447080	there's no point in having any one of those pathways by itself um or at least there's no
2447080	2453800	obvious point that I can see um so there's a there's a serious combinatorial problem there
2454840	2460760	that's never been seriously addressed and I suspect it's borderline impossibly difficult
2462280	2467800	but if what actually you see instead is a kind of a spontaneous proto metabolism that happens to
2467800	2473960	have a particular network structure to it and what the first genes do is increase flux through
2473960	2481560	that pathway for example by steepening the driving force so increasing the fixation of CO2 to make
2481560	2485480	the first intermediates in that pathway then you get increased flux through the entire network so
2485480	2490760	that's not intrinsically very difficult what that says then if you take a step back is that what the
2490760	2495880	first genes are doing is amplifying the network and so the fact that we get the same network and
2495880	2500200	the entire thing is amplified is in fact a direct prediction of assuming that network comes first
2501880	2507880	in which case we should be able to turn that on its head and say okay well if if we can look at the
2507880	2511960	conditions that give rise to that entire network then we should be able to predict the you know
2511960	2515880	if we can get the entire network under this set of conditions but not that set then we might be able
2515880	2524200	to say the conditions under which life arose well that's very good thank you okay thank you for that
2524200	2530920	Nick we have another question from Chelsea Chen could you unmute yourself please Chelsea and
2530920	2538680	if you want to put your video on we can see you too perhaps. Hello can I just ask about why ATP
2539800	2547720	can be spontaneously synthesized in water while other nucleosides can't? Yes you can ask
2548440	2555400	I'd like to say I could answer we did we did some molecular dynamic simulations on that
2557160	2562920	and it seems to be in part to do with the with the charge density on ferric iron,
2562920	2567880	ferric iron was necessary and other other other other metal ions did not work in the same way,
2567880	2575560	it seems to be partly to do with the actual orientation of the phosphate group of acetyl
2575560	2581880	phosphates in relation to the ferric iron and the ADP tail I mean we came up with a potential
2581880	2585960	explanation for the orientation some of it seems to be to do with the way that the ring
2585960	2591400	nitrogen's interact with ferric iron and I don't understand that very well but they interact very
2591400	2600040	differently with say guanine compared to adenosine so why I'm not quite sure but the prediction is
2600040	2606200	that you know molecular dynamic prediction is that you do not have the orientation of the acetyl
2606200	2611080	phosphate in the right place and and it tends to abstract the catalyst it abstracts the ferric
2611080	2616280	iron which interacts with the nitrogen on the ring instead so we have some answers but I'm not
2616280	2620360	persuaded that they're the right answers or that the molecular dynamic simulations are
2622840	2629080	real I don't know enough of what's going on under the bonnet with them with the atomic forces that
2629160	2637320	they're predicting I am not a chemist I'm a biochemist and and you know I try to get my hands
2637320	2642040	dirty with all of this stuff but it's I think we need a proper chemist to look at some of that
2643720	2650360	okay thank you thanks we have a question from Jim Cunningham on this chat box there
2651640	2657480	Nick can you see that uh oh he's asking when when when will the book come out about all this
2657480	2665080	it takes more than 45 minutes to digest at all well I I am trying to put together a proposal
2665080	2669480	now to write a book on the origin of life specifically covering more or less what I've
2669480	2676600	said today but it will be some years before it's written I mean we're not I'm neither chemist
2676600	2684200	nor biochemist so I do have a book that was out last year that touches on some of the actual
2684200	2688920	chemistry of the Krebs cycle and some of the ideas I've just talked about now so that's out
2688920	2696360	already but the genetic code stuff is quite new um and I'm I'm quite excited by it but
2697800	2703560	the path going from a pattern to a predicted set of steps that we can then test that uh
2703560	2707800	I I want to delay writing the book until we've done some of that and I have something to say about
2708520	2720040	hmm these these steps you're predicting they seem to depend uh on specifically specific
2720040	2725880	earth conditions but perhaps earth-like conditions um what they
2728360	2735320	yes they they I mean what we would get from this metabolic network is a specific set of amino acids
2736280	2740600	and we would tend to get those amino acids and we would tend to we would predict an order in
2740600	2748360	which we get them as well um the extent to which we would expect to see exactly the four bases
2748360	2754040	that we see in RNA compared to a bunch of other possible ones that are and there's a lot of modified
2754040	2761160	bases around um I'm less sure about that so one thing we want to do is is model metabolism
2762120	2767240	where we're varying the thermodynamic parameters and kinetic parameters on each of the but
2767240	2771480	basically it's more the thermodynamics than the kinetics what's the likelihood of each reaction
2771480	2779400	happening and given that we have no clear idea no clear data under the sets of conditions that
2779400	2784440	we might be thinking about if we if we model it we can vary across orders of magnitude and obviously
2784440	2789160	if you make an oxidation reaction more likely then a reduction step is less likely and so on so we
2789160	2795960	can we can we can vary parameters um in relation to each other and try to see how much of of
2795960	2803800	metabolism we actually recover and do we recover then the the core of it in which case we would
2803800	2809000	expect to see exactly the same interaction somewhere else in which case if we discovered life on Mars
2809000	2814120	and it has exactly the same genetic code then it doesn't prove that it was a contamination
2814840	2821960	um or it may be that it's much looser than that and that um that if you know if effectively
2822600	2827640	we would expect to see some but not all or or or it's very contingent on which bases you produce
2827640	2833240	and which ones get incorporated into RNA or DNA uh then that would come up with a different set
2833240	2838360	of predictions there's a lot that we don't know or I don't know um but but there's a lot you know
2838440	2844920	there's a huge amount that can be done here so yeah could could I could I ask a quick supplementary
2844920	2851400	on that please nick um you've been talking about the the bases you find in in RNA and you mentioned
2851400	2859720	uracil yes as I recall in in in DNA we've got cytosine, uranine, alanine and thymine have we not
2859720	2866920	do we know do we know why thymine came along as opposed to uracil in DNA um I mean there are ideas
2866920	2876760	out there um and it's partly to do with stability um and and and decreasing the risk of mutations
2876760	2883800	because if I'm probably going to get this wrong I can't quite remember but um if if if there is a
2884360	2890120	I think an oxidation of uracil then uh you end up with producing something very similar to one
2890120	2897640	of the other bases uh I need to double check that uh in other words there there's more scope for
2898440	2911960	um for I suppose confusion replacing the wrong base so so that'd be part of it in part um RNA
2911960	2917480	does not tend to form structures as stable as DNA and I'm not sure that's to do with the bases
2917480	2927560	so much as to do with the deoxy versus ribose um but I I don't we've not really started thinking
2927560	2932280	very much about DNA yet it's plain that as soon as you've got DNA you've got a much larger much
2932280	2938360	more stable structure which is going to lower the error error error rate um but uh that's another
2938360	2943800	another reason I want to delay writing a book on this until I until I figure it out how does DNA
2943960	2949400	how does that fit into this picture right well please don't delay it too long
2950360	2956920	like to read it um now then Chelsea Chen has had a supplementary right if she's still around
2956920	2964760	she's welcome to read otherwise I'll read it out are you there Chelsea yes do you want to go ahead
2964760	2972040	with your supplementary about purely RNA compounds uh sorry this is not no longer Chelsea Chen but
2972040	2982440	but it's the same question do one yes do we know do we know if there is uh if there are any RNA
2982440	2988280	purely RNA compounds that are capable of catalyzing reactions such as uh condensing uh condensing
2988280	2996040	amino acids or or nucleotides um well I mean there there's been a lot of interest over decades in
2996040	3002920	what's called the RNA world and there are plenty of ribosomes which are basically catalysts a bit
3002920	3009720	like an enzyme enzymes are made of proteins and ribosomes are made of RNA and RNA will tend to
3009720	3016680	form into interesting shapes and knots and has quite a wide range of catalytic functions much
3016680	3024360	less than proteins but but but certainly um you know capable of catalyzing quite complex chemistry
3025000	3028680	and so this has been the basis for what's being called the RNA world hypothesis
3030440	3036120	and that really goes back to to people like Leslie Orgel in the 1960s in the late 1960s
3036840	3041000	and it the ideas are very simple and very appealing which is more or less that
3041560	3047720	because of complementary base pairing it's it's you know conceptually very easy for an RNA to make
3047720	3053640	a copy of itself whereas for a peptide to make a copy of itself is much more problematic and complex
3053720	3059880	and and difficult um so if you were to say which comes first then RNA has to come before
3059880	3066840	peptides in that sense at least as a hereditary mechanism um but what that has tended to lead
3066840	3072680	to is a rather purest view of an RNA world where as I said RNA invents everything else it invents
3072680	3078280	all of metabolism and that view has been I would say receding over the last five to ten years or so
3078280	3082600	with a kind of recognition that chemistry is dirtier than that and that there will be other
3082600	3086360	things in there there will be lipids in there there will be amino acids maybe peptides in there
3086360	3092600	and we've we've got a kind of a dirty RNA world so there's no question that RNA is central to all
3092600	3099880	of this um and that's that this was almost only the first code and it's interesting that the ribosome
3100440	3106920	which is the big protein building factories in cells they're basically ribosomes um the the
3107640	3112520	the RNA content is very high and as far as I'm aware it's the ribosomes that are doing
3112600	3119880	most of the catalysis of peptide bond formation um so so it's interesting that they have an
3119880	3123960	absolutely central critical job and this is one thing that we're trying to think our way through
3123960	3128920	to and do some experiments on as well but this is a highly populated area you may say because it's
3129480	3133880	it's so central to the question people have been working on it a lot for a long time um
3133880	3142440	um ironically RNA does not copy itself in cells and this this kind of holy grail of having a
3142440	3148040	ribosome that will copy itself which was the the essence of the RNA world actually the it's an
3148040	3153960	enzyme that does that job it's the RNA polymerase it's a magnesium dependent protein um and so
3153960	3163240	there's this this interesting um RNA effectively copies proteins and proteins copy RNA so we're
3163240	3169720	back in this strange chicken and egg situation that uh that that is not easily unscrambled um
3169720	3173720	I've forgotten exactly what your question was but essentially could how much work does RNA do
3173720	3178760	and the answer is it's very central to a lot of this um but it it's not the only thing that's going
3178760	3187480	on uh and I think peptides early are are pretty necessary. Nick that's been a very stimulating
3188440	3196280	afternoon thank you so much um before we go um you you you've clearly got a collection of your
3196280	3201720	fans here in the audience would you like just to say give a quick a quick commercial for the
3201720	3206920	other book that you have written very recently the one on trans you call transformers. Oh that's
3206920	3215400	very kind of you yes why not I'm not sure that I'm not sure I would be intellectually fair of me to
3215880	3220840	over plug it because it's it's a book on the Krebs cycle uh which is not to everybody's taste
3220840	3227960	right on it attempts to link the chemistry that I touched on on the origin of life which is which
3227960	3234680	is making Krebs cycle intermediates from CO2 and hydrogen but I have I have another lab group at
3234680	3240040	UCL which is working on mitochondrial functions so still and energetics and so on right and it
3240040	3243800	turned out both groups were measuring Krebs cycle intermediates for most of their lives so
3244520	3250280	I had to put two and two together um and and you know the the Krebs cycle goes into reverse in
3250280	3256120	cancer for example and it's it's certainly um and then what's it doing well it's driving cells
3256120	3260600	copying themselves it's instead of being about energy it's about making the building blocks
3260600	3265800	required to make a new cancer cell so all of the lipids all of the DNA and and so on that's required
3266600	3273000	so metabolism the central cycle in metabolism is central right across the whole spectrum of life
3273000	3279400	from the origin of life up to um to aging and cancer and I there's an epilogue where I have a
3279400	3286200	go at linking it to consciousness as well which is beyond most people's tolerance for speculation
3286200	3290520	in science but that's where I finished with the book so that's my plug for the book but if you
3290520	3296360	don't like metabolic biochemistry then then then you may prefer just to watch a short talk online
3296360	3302360	or something right okay well thank you so much right well we've had a wonderful afternoon
3303080	3309000	which I've hugely enjoyed and I'm sure everybody else has so without a do I apart from thanking you
3309000	3316840	again I'd like to pass over to our chairman uh professor David Southwood if I don't have his
3316840	3324920	screen up in front of me but uh David over to you if I may thank you Ellen and Nick thank you very
3324920	3335080	much for an invigorating afternoon um origin of life I think how can how can we not be interested
3335080	3344440	in it and how can we not feel some of the emotions that you clearly feel the curiosity of it the um
3345320	3351720	the fact that things have come out of it and yet there we are it's one of the big mysteries that
3351720	3358920	we live with as human beings in my view so I really think you've taken us on a wonderful voyage
3358920	3367480	and your enthusiasm is absolutely magnificent I think we'll need to communicate I much admire
3368120	3375880	and um so I think if I can ask people generally to unmute or to use the symbol for clapping
3375880	3386040	to give you a sign that we really did appreciate your time this time this afternoon so thank you very much
